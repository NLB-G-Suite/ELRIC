Has he learned nothing? He was just some chick he was banging on the side.
Thats a ton of that junk
here comes the necro.
Woah woah woah woah wait
how much more to the movie?
"Time to inject a glow stick into her!"
Don't inject the brain, just inject the BOOBS!
*She was, but you get my point
Fuck, man! Really?!
Is he the reanimator from the second movie?
>Attacked by zombies
he DOES know that if she revives she'll be spewing blood all over, right
>Learned nothing
BRAINNNNNNNNS

"ITE: One of the ponies makes the others a bunch of pretty dresses and they put on a fashion show!"
Not really.
Gosh darn cat.
meh, best song is Winter Wrap-Up
also
best episode
just saying
professional dress design=markers!
*bobs head to music*
Rarity made me actually look at fashion
wwu is best song
14If I see that darn cat one more time....
07switching to webchat.. brb
winter wrap-up is the best
Rainbow Tank is best Tank
I loved Suited for Success, personally
ding
Rainbow dash is already a freaking tank
the rhyming in this song is terrible
totally broke up when she said tank.
I learned something
Perhaps the best part of this song is that every piece of anatomy is correctly named
The reprise of this song is my favorite because of the emotion the singer puts in her voice and the vocal harmonies
0abramsdash
as DaPS is a Rarity episode, I'll let you have that
11I know, bitch. I know.
11(Kidding)
(as in whoever dores Rarity's singing voice)
everyone but rarity was a bitch in dis episode, IMO
THIS IS WHIINIIIIIIIIIING
4BABY, I KNOW IT /Bender
thank celestia for ponies after that movie
07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMrQcn-LiO0&feature=channel_video_title is a bit too long

Flüttershy knows a lot about different kinds of stitching, but that doesn't mean she knows anything about fashion composition
wut?
shes like wtf are you laughing at?
20% cooler. YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT!
i just told her ponies deal with it
WOOT
Fluttershy can sew, but she CAN'T design.
I bet they'd probably have liked their initial dresses more if they saw themselves in them.
Whoo hoo~

DO THAT TO THIS VID
SEND ME O'S
:0
0I have seen full-suit pony cosplay.
I'm okay with this.
2,14Thank you sumica....for returning the image I tried to burn out of my memory
0And that's a barrier that must NOT be breached.
14SWAG
i hate cosplay
YES
THIS SHIt'S DIVINE
hahahaha
DIE!!!!!!!
no not the kids show and my plesure
Timez for some swagz
Honestly, some of the full-suit pony cosplay I've seen is actually pretty good.
oh. its done
Especially this one Rainbow Dash outfit that was going around for a while.
the suit look good but it's um borderline furry.
thank celestia
...
BLOAW
/me sings along
yes, everyone suggest the live show
hey we were missing some people tonight
herospirit I am fairly sure that is not a weakness I am alone in
2,14 that's...a little extreme patrik...
Definitely dancing in my seat
I've actually contemplated getting into cosplay before.
0Mr_PATRIK, we would have to cut off their breasts.
>a little
0Simple.
the only thing I would change is the little bit in the middle
ahh yes, i saw that on national geographic oncd
it seems... unbronylike
suddenly, people advocating genital mutilation... wtf happened while I napped? :P
lol SA
Hmm?
... I don't have any PMs.
Now you do
Oh there it is.
hey luna let's watch the best movie ever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUli1YWL21E
I see no problem with cosplay. :0
k... well I think cosplay looks fun, even if I've never tried it.
cosplay=/=full body suit
0I have no problem with cosplayers.
ooh audiosurf
WOOOOOOOOOT
0Serious = ?
doesn't look like a very intense track honestly
neither do I. It's not something I'd ever do, bu I don't see any problems with it.
what's the hardest audiosurf songs you guys have ever played?
Aaw right
14SO MUCH YAYY~
I don't have a problem with cosplay, I've actually done it once before... I think last year?
ive seen many a good time ruined by a cosplayer either bragging or complaining.
"anything else"
Pendulum rocks
Suddenly fail?
i just do not like cosplay. its creepy to me
I'd cosplay, but it'd have to be flawless or I wouldn't be satisfied
>implying people should be mutilated for having a hobby
I think.
we already watch this, like 3 seconds ago
Though... I barely had to put any effort into it because the character I was looks a lot like me
this song is pretty mellow....
I've done 2 cosplays, and they were simple, a shirt, and hair dye
/me is very high on pepsi.
It's really cool when people sew these elaborate costumes from some show, I think.
I possibly could beat that song w/o hitting a grey.
fursuits?
0Those are called Fursuits.
those can get creepy
0Where you dress up as an animal.
I've had Audiosurf for quite a while and have a lot of hours of play logged on it.
/me makes a not to not bring up cosplay again
note*
0Depending on the design, they can be really awesome, or nightmarishly creepy.
exactly
Eeeeeeeyup, have a few furry friends myself.
Yeah, for example, you could totally cosplay as Teddie from Persona 4 in a full-body suit and it wouldn't be creepy at all
>mfw OOOOH those are NFL logos, not the NHL ones
ooh that's brilliant...
is htis the 8minute version
this is long
I need food.
WOO STEVKINGS!
:)
this is nice and all, but can we move on?
I haven't seen yellow text all night
or purple now that I think of it
/me is back and rageing
I think he was abducted by ponies
dumb isp
or blue!

my mods are disappearing -.-
don't worry
HAH

Sad I missed the actual movies and episodes

Apparantly

Haha! Dr. Horrible!
07noooo

Woot Dr Horrible
I cannot believe my eeeeeyes
THE PIE DISAPPEARED BECAUSE ANCIENT ALIENS
Which one?
Rainbow Dash being voiced by a gay man. That's totally not indicative of anything.
07spiders thing...
^haha.
nah
0So... how's everyone doing?
I honestly didn't think I'd like Dr. Horrible as much as I did.
Good, yourself?
0I'm doing fine.
ACH!!!
not that spider thing
a worse spider thing
Seriously, he could get any girl he wanted if he swung that way
*Shiver*
Sleepy.
DHSAB was okay
it had a couple really good songs
I liked it, to be sure.
and I'll never forgive him for Alien 4
>applejack has a penis
you hurt me
Wait....waht?
dat repeat
Applejack does have a penis, but only when genderbent.
How did we reach this conclusion?
wooo Dr. Whoof!
And when she's genderbent, her name is... Applejack.
Joss Whedon is definitely overrated, but not for Dr Horrible... :P
hmmm, what's this?
oh, Av!

WOOOOT
> Anthology
<3
epic
wow this is a long vid :O
Maybe I'm alone in this, but I actually like Kanye West's music.
mostly because I associate it with ponies now
I don't hate this song, which is the best anyone can get out of me when it comes to rap
I like Power, but that's about it.
Thunder_Dash, Second
the full version of POWER isn't very good
the parts that aren't like this bit suck
^Yeah, I only have the shortened version
even if it may have been pre-determined
Really, my fav Kanye songs are "Lost In The World" and "So Appalled". Monster would be good if Nicki Minaj didn't ruin it.
I'll take this as my exit. See everypony tomorrow for the drawing.
NANANANANA
KATAMARI DAMACYYYYYYYYYY
gurls on fillllm
Lost in the World was one of my favorite songs.
lol

whazzzzzuuuuuup
a reboot of a reboot?
emodash!
no, a sequel
lol gingers

Cage was the only amusing part of the first one, might bootleg. Hopes aren't high though.
seceret butt fun
but was denied
but i still haven't heard about their event
BLARG
that exists?
*Snap* *Snap*
mmm, this song
Yeah, like I said, hopes aren't high. Cage is usually amusing in bad movies though.
4 Just know that we've got things in the work, DSN
if I get to choose the B-movie, I'm either going with "Birdemic" or "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
oh wow Birdemic
that's... special
suddenly Galadrarity
I gotta say again though
that was the best LOTR marathon ever
Yeah
i think I'll go with "Nudist Colony Of The Dead" though, because that is just hilariously awful
Sumic Watch me!!!!
whooooo
Sumica*
The LOTR event was great.
/me flashes back to several years ago!
07Season 2 live - streaming is gonne be fun

Chaccarone
EBRBRBRBRBRBR
chacarron
I only recently discovered I get The Hub. And many fucks were given that day.
I could honestly hear Pinkie singing that...
Likewise, DSN.
>mfw when I found out I have Hub at my house
07Also we are still recruiting
07should you be interested please e-mail us
/me does not have The Hub because he switched to Cable the last time he moved.
0._.
Luna.. e-mail to where?
I knew I had hub before I liked Ponies.
oh oh me luna...er wait =p
07bronystate@gmail.com
I don't find this song amusing at all tbh
Alright.. I'll consider it, thanks
07We are looking for streamers and moderators
I have Charter and I have Hub.
Mr_PATRIK But horses don't have magic nor sentience...soooo the rules are kinda altered.
I'm still considering applying for moddyness.
It's Charter.
WEEE WUUU
unicorns have magic, not earth ponies
I... I might actually have The Hub!
4Hard work, dedication, determination, and pretty colors
I've tested and it's horribly slow
07:)
4No prob : D
/me was writing.. :P
I though the same thing DSN, it's lower requirements then you would think.
hm, how MUCH hard work?
4WEll
Mr_PATRICK Pegasi can stand on clouds, thats magic.
4I've been here since the beginning
4So
Mr_PATRIK*
ahh oki
TO EQD MY FRIENDS
Head bobbing time
07omnomnom weekends
pelvik thrust time
oh wow B:TAS
the Hub is fast becoming the best channel on the air
HARVEY DENT
earth ponies have no magic abilities whatsoever
now if only Adventure time goes over there
Flashback to few hours ago!
07if only it was available in europe...
D:
This is relevant to our viewings tonight
I HATED MY FATHER
I HATED my father
ROLLING
4Except that the Hub won't be BEST, until it has Adventure Time. Good luck on the Hub ever obtaining the rights to it
Cn is not gonna let go of that one
I never knew my father...:*(
Eugh, Adventure Time.
07I streamed adventure time earlier
Adventure Time is.. strange.
Don't like it. ^
The only things it's missing are the rest of the DCAU, Adventure Time, and Regular Show.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCEEEEEE
It's just strange.
CN regains its title as the greatest animation channel ever
Because you're the best
regular show is better\
I don't expect the latter two to ever get on it, but the rest of the DCAU could probably show up.
it's more strange they are gonna do a rule 63 ep of adventure time
I saw that.
And I immediately thought "WTF."
THey did.
and KND
yes they did
Oh Courage.
man, 90s Cartoon Network
That show made it hard to sleep lol
ding.
I've never really gotten into Adventure Time. I really liked KND though.

How much foresight?
And then the angels consume his soul>?

Why do you think he has great foresight?
fortytwo cakes of foresight. That's four tens!
ACTION MUSIC
Four tens and an extra two.
If you mean because he set up all the easter eggs and everything, well.
Yeah lets go there!
You'll see.

Hi Daru
Dari*
A very close fringe of mine once went carol slinging with the local pier.
Hey Barry.
Yeah, my sister and I used to watch it when we were younger.
Do you get Nicktoons?
Dunno, probably.
It's a cable channel.
A horse, a house, my kingdom for a hearse.
Lawl. XD
anyway, all this month on Nicktoons, they're airing a different DBZ movie. One on Wednesday, and another on Thusday
It is a Saturday
Hi I_G
hm
Maybe
Dari, Gotta speak to you about something
Yes?
Ok.
My face when one of my favorite musical bands is coming over to my town
ello ello
/me has not even contemplated going to sleep yet.
i finally woke up before 2pm on a weekend
hehehehe
It helps that I have more caffeine in my system than I probably should have.
i one had 3 5 hour energies within 12 hours of each other
Only had 4 hours of sleep tonight. Feeling relatively normal
hehehehe
Mmmm, old pizza.
its my favorite too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktzC8dy1V4
hehehehe
Hi guys
I know the feeling
any pizza my family has, if any is left over, is usually finished the very next day
if that
in*
I was replacing on with in
i get to live in the basement :)
dun' worry
I don't have a basement
yer not the only of that age around
I lived in a basement once.
It really wasn't that bad.
well
its more of a bunker i built than a basement
23.

16 going on 17 in about a week or two
yeah, a single week
Awesome.
errr 17 in November
Dari?
Mind reminding us all yer age?

Dari when does the stream marathon start?
Marathon?
stream marathon?
wait
there's no such thing as a marathon
Do you mean Saturday BMN?
aren't you?
Always Saturdays
9PM EST
hehehehe
xDDD
whats the BMN show like tonight?
The BMN is at 2PM EST
or 7PM GMT if European
then this afternoon
Am I early?
Yes.
The stream is already over.
You early for the Euroshow, that's for sure
is it just the same as the stream last night?
I think I'm about 2 hours early then
actually, you are 4 hours early for the Euroshow
Two or four, I think.
The Euro show starts at 2 PM EST, 7 PM GMT
Two hours 'til preshow
4 'til the movies
Have we already decided the movies for next week,or is that in 2-4 hours too?
Not chosen yet
That'll be today at intermission
*knight
Right
(dat typo)
I'll stick around here for a bit then
DecapKing: between 2½ and 3 hours
and show starts at around 2pm EST?
yeah, DecapKing.
Can't remember.
it ALWAYS starts at LEAST on time
>always
:P
especially The Re-Animator
that movie was FUCKED UP!
Isn't the Re-Animator after the lottery?
How long until lottery
yeah
And yeah, that movie was... yeah...
/me admittedly did not even try to watch once he realized how much it would gross him out.
Just listened to it instead.
i only stopped watching after that reverse necrophilia rape scene
Probably.
yeah
I know someone just asked it...
I meant the Euroshow is always on time
not that the Amerikashow ever it
*is
(it does have technical problems once every other week)
nah
Did that on purpose
Russkia and Assertia? (jk jk)
xD
/me is really going bonkers
Y'know, there's one thing I don't like about TF2.
And that's no sprays on Valve's public servers.
which BMN week to be exact?
16 i think
it says on EQD in one of the posts
I noticed
hehehe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3cWUGmPRso

/me plays "Stand Up" by The Prodigy as he enters the chatroom
So,anything happened while i was gone?
we decided to kill you off
eeeeeeeyup
AIN'T THAT A LOAD O' SHEET!
eeeeenope
eeeeeeeeeeeeyup
They did, I saw them discuss it
NOPONY CAN KILL THE LEADER OF THE HIGH ONES OFF!
well
(The 3th Birthday joke BTW)
we chose to leave you tied up at PrincessMolestia's house
have fun
But wait....she isn't here yet.
eeeeenope
she's just out
but she'll be back soon
Not my opinion
MY BRAIN WAS ALWAYS MUSH.
and yelling
oh
Ok.
or ill just shoot you with my crossbow
:D
I'll just stay here.
or i can let Pinkiemania 'play' with you
Waddaya mean?
i believe you can put 2 and 2 together
?
eh, ill just leave you at Molestia's
PLEASE NO
You're cool.
also that idea is already trademarked for some type of graphic novel/anime
orly
not really
Ok.
I don't want to stay here!Somepony get me out please!
dont worry
it probably isnt as bad as they say it is
or maybe it is
IDK
DAMNIT
hey MeteorVenture
heya:D
Hi Metwor
Meteor*
I'M DOOMED
do all allicorns whine this much?
argh.. all this talk of corn is making me even more hungry
all right then......
nah
thats bitching
heya pinkie
I don't get where people get "alicorn" from.
i think its cause they are everything?
haha time for earthbound
Godddamn that server was bad...
I'M STUCK
Earthbound? Awesome.
i'm playing some earthbound zero
How's everyone doing
I'm irritated thanks to a crappy public server in TF2.
/me is still chained to a wall
It got to the point where our sole line of defense against our intel being capped was a Heavy/Medic combo. All the Engies ragequit to be Spies and Snipers.
Nope.DecapKing chained me this time...i think.
makes sense
Crysis 2 was aweosme
It seems awesome.
It is, I preordered it
And just that the trailer has Invaders must Die in it totally screams AWESOME to me.
Pretty much RP
But just look at MW2.People still play it to this day!
Well, but it's CoD.
Orite
Other franchises like, say, Crysis, are much more prone to being a fad on the multiplayer side
Though honestly the Crysis 2 multiplayer was awesome as balls, at least in the demo
Singularity?
i hope BF3 multiplayer is as good as BF2
Me too Decap, BF is probably one of the only games I'll play multiplayer and enjoy it
Me neither.
But i do like BFH.
haven't tried it, unfortunately
I enjoyed BF BC 2 quite a bit
Didn't play the first one but should
It's free.Except for ALL THE FREAKIN' ITEMS IN THE STORE.
i didnt like BFH
it wasnt truly free
it just is Zero
i like the metal covers that fans made
Like I said, FiM is the West's Touhou
Touhou is a series of japanese indie games that goes back to the 90's
But the community around those games and the characters is immense
I'm not into Touhou at all
i like it.. the music is GREAT if nothing else
Me neither, though I can see why people are
But if you compare the amount of fan-driven content Touhou has and the amount of fan-made content FiM has, I think it's the only worthy comparison
In a smaller scale probably, but we're getting there :p
Yup
BUNKER
/me creates a bunker and then runs into it.
I don't waaaaant to buy a carrrrrr
10ohai:3
but then again they even had a fanmade anime of sorts.. i think it only had 1 episode though and idk about the overall quality.. but apparently it had some higher up voice actors on it
Especially not an old Van.
It was awesome quality, I watched it.
i still have yet to watch it
/me secretly sets up C4 charges around Pegacorn's bunker
C4!
Damn, he's psychic too
Nah,i just used my magic.
...not sure I follow you, Pinkie_Pie
NOT THAT
Wait
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tara Strong is fucking amazing
Tara Strong is BAWS
wat?
Yeah I just think it's odd
yes you are
must not make gay thought pun
just noticed
NEED SOME HELP HERE!
well.. actually i still don't see it
ohhh ok
/me has set a C4 charge on DecapKing's back
/me detonates the C4
Dunno
fuu
well i was
I'm gonna go to sleep. Wake me up when the stream starts.

yeah
Looking forward to seeing that, actually
^
10it doesn't strain my eyes
10I'm not fussed about it, but yeah. it's ok
Doesn't strain my eyes, but it doesn't do anything for me.
I hate the live action Transformers movies.
I dunno, it strains my eyes when they have a lot of things that pop out too far from the screen
Eh, I like the live action Transformers movies
Well actually,i haven't seen 1 and 3,but i saw 2,and it was the worst movie i ever saw.
First one is pretty good, at least
I'm gonna repost the vid i posted since it doesn't work:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPJUBQd-PNM&feature=related
DAMNIT,STILL DOESN'T WORK
Eh?
Not for me.
The problem with 3D imo is that
We just had the change to High definition cameras not many years ago
And 3D makes everything blurry as balls
THEY ARE INERT
It's not spectacular in any way really
I mean for games 3D is pretty nice at 60fps

2,14 hello ziltois
Oh dear
2,14ziltoid* even
My leverage power is decreasing!
2,14 not sure
And i know why!
Gonna go upstairs to play some. Be back in a few hours guys.
hehehehahhaha
hahhahhahhahah
It's because i'm chained to a wall!That's why i can't use the power of leverage!
no it ain't.
orly
It is just because you were never meant to hold that much power
eeeeyup
You're a creature of the past
NO ONE PONY SHOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER
But i was able to summon a Tank using the power of leverage!
That power was only lent to you
Waddaya mean by "You're a creature of the past"?
lol i know
Variety and originality create power
twas a joke:P
the lack thereof only permits power to be bestowed temporarily.
BAM
NEVER DOUBT THE POWER OF THE HIGH ONES.
Oh, the high ones? You mean the mods?
Nope.Just the ponies that trancend time.Those are the High Ones.

I was doing homework and take-home quiz during BMN last night.
Originally, yes
yes
2,14 based on, yes
you take the fun out of everything dari :P
Loosely based on "Herbert West: Re-Animator"
The fact that I am familiar with Lovecraft should do it.

best done via email staff@mibbit.com
2,14 lol for a moment there bronzeheart, you sounded like arktis
Hmm, the wiki indicated that it'd be easier over IRC, I'll send an email instead then.
I'm rooting for Scheepers because she's ranked 81st in the world, against the 7th ranked Schiavone.
CBS
K thnx.
hi

Dream Theater

It would be a very bad idea for a pony to break a leg.
6And I think we got a few more since.
lawl
well then use normal xchat not xchat gnome. xchat-gnome really isn't xchat itself i've used xchat on ubuntu and never had an issue

inb4 Wanna know how I got these scars?
just like twist and apple bloom did
0Well, shouldn't they still be in other seasons, looking? I liked that sub plot.
yea, handeling their friendships after getting their marks would make a good episode
I like it, too, but one can stretch it for too long. Good plots have CONCLUSIONS
6!nicks
0Maybe one at a time
6Cool, it works.
S1 was more characterization, but S2 could definitely do more advancement from that point.

14I dont see why not.
>_<
and nore than csi
lol
Get a woman
10well if we're having a meeting-style discussion
lol
not the mare
14The difference is voice over typing.
6Not all of us have voice.
except for him against Pinkie PIe
10are you going to be typing out every single sentence you say while you say it? :P
6Which is why we're ruling it out for the moment.
6I can
6Just not during streaming.
lawl, nah we can let the viewers hear our conversation
in both
NOTHING bad could happen :P
10atm*, as in during streaming
14We could do it after the stream. Unless someone has to go after.
6Completely unable to hear it.
10yeah but he'll be able to hear us, and then respond by typing
:O that needs to happen
10I agree I won't really want to wait till afterwards
inc boom
A Telescope! KILL IT!
14Oi, you guys. Well, whatever works then.
6Dat Scarecrow being back.
Suddenly, the crowd disperses.

Blame hero for actions of villains.
Logic
lol
10lolololowned
Batrave
lol
6'Tis why we have Skype. And it's one of the thing we'll be discussing during the meeting.
BATRAVE IN THE BATCAVE
someone needs to call Pinkie Pie
Where are you? where are YOU?
6We're doing it here.
14Last time we tried a conference call with Skype, it was an utter distaer.
6Simple as that.
lol
14*disaster
6I can't use anything else atm.
Bruce.
say that fast
Cool,the far side of the moon looks very different from the side we can see all the time
I said it, expecting it to sound naughty.
I was sorely disappointed.
Derp
I felt that crack. :(
ouch
My legs are already sore.
owwwwww
freeeeeeeeens
V.A.T.S > Legs 0%
The far side is covered in craters,the near side has barely any
his legs are now only 20% functional
that'S cause the far side is our meatshield against all the crap saturn and his bastard ring-buddies throw at us
Fear the coin!
dat coin
Fear the Chekhov's Gun!
/me is lurking
We all know its a doublesided coin
0...and going to be a current patient again after that.
He wins against premeditated murder.
Steal his coin and replace it with one that always gives the same answer.twoface foiled :D
dang, his logic is correc
i mean correct -_-;
whose logic?
Coin was double-headed in the first place
Batman's
But twoface scratched a side out to make tails
how it got burned ?
Same way he did
watch the movie
and youll get it
He scratches it out in the comics
In the comics, he scratched it up after he got acid thrown in his face.

nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
american healthcare system (y)
A?
never heard of it, I'll look it up
It's a children's film.
Harvey Dent. You are now Darth Vader.
Probably the most bloody/messy children's film in existence. :D
BURNED FACE
darn
TWO FACES
ONE BURNED
someone made the page editable
ONE NORMAL
WAT DO
well, I don't think that after the care for the burn they'd need to watch him recover
10emmettbrown wouldn't he also probably be in a shitload of pain?
"They called you...Harvey Two Chin"
I think it's A.
LOL
yep
Why does his chin look like balls?
Manly chin
10but scatr he runs around like it's nothing for the rest of the film
They don't look much like balls anymore
10with open gashes all over his face
SEGA
Harvey Two Face.
:3
0We're only halfway through, aren't we?
At this point, everypony in the theater was like "OH SHIIIII-"
I dunno, I'd say A because it has a high rating.
I want a mountain of money
DUN DUN DUUUUN
holla holla get dolla
Unless one of the balls are supposed to look burnt
dat reveal
70%
sooooooooooo pwetty
Not even watching :p
lolboat
05though its horrible
Harvey Dent becomes two face? This comes out of nowhere
05hmm
lol
and I dunno Dari, I think it could go either way
Sliding down money.
He's not even wearing that much make up
I always wondered how much it would hurt to drink whiskey through a burn wounded mouth
Only fucking Heath Ledger.
Most of it is CGI
Watership Down is a pretty awesome film though.
0Is this pile his half?
14Oooh, Watership Down
05mhm
Don't worry, our government does the same thing with its money
I came in here at around 1.2

about 50-40 minutes left
lol
>MY HALF.
05if the 13th warrior

THAT'S HIS HALF.

He's wearing a bald cap covered in burn marks and some little square things for the CGI
HALF.

It took me several rewatches to realize that Lau was burning up there.
the faces
07and the songs touch my heart everytime
aaaand we've come full circle
dat deflation
I probably did
fun thing is, as soon as the fires outside go out, there's stillg onna be plenty usable notes INSIDE of the mountain
Does if you electrify it
but I wouldn't know
dat lamborghini

much more subtle
stream crashed for anyone else?
14Rocky Horror Picture Show, oh no XD
doesn't burning technically require carbon?
07Hell yes :D
no

"Burning" is simply a heated oxygenation of material
SUBTLE!
Haha, grease.

It would release more energy, too
