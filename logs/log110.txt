"Kill me"
youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
They did it to a dog's severed head, and you can find video of the dog eating, the food dropping out of its mouth. It's easily one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.
Braaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnssssssssssssss....

ITS A TRAP!
Darf14 and everypony else: It's lovecraft.
Quote the end.
What does she think she is doing?
Keep your suspension of disbelief for the enjoyment of the film
WHat good is going to come out of this
what is this stupidity
"ok, so he injects the head with green stuff and it comes back to life, right" >makes sense "and then it talks" >HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE
this doesn't feel like lovecraft... it's not misty enough and there's no cosmic undescribable horror
lol, I think all the zombies scared away a good portion of our viewers
think futurama, those heads could talk.
I'm pretty sure LOSING my suspension of disbelief made this more fun, Meanwhile .
and the black people aren't dead enough
14Probably. :P
It's very liberal with the original Lovecraft story
11The sign for entering this movie: "PLEASE HANG ALL DISBELIEF AT THE DOOR"
and then he brings the body to life. WAT
BLARGH
Yeah, this is nothing like the lovecraft i know!
07its the B movie
NNNNNOOOOOO
14The grossness would have me lol
this movie has a suprisingly low black guy bodycount
07it's normal

11Labotomy
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!

oooohhh....
This movie works on the Ed Wood principle of suspension of disbelief: IE people will be ok with anything.
Now he's double dead
no big deal, fuckers dead anyway
IST THART ILLEGAL NOW?
where are my eyes?
Labotomy? And still moving?
you can lobotomize a zombie?
Glowing green goop could totally fix that.
Herbert, got a bit of a HEAD-ache?
my head... oh, what a party...
Goddamn it, you should realize that lobotomy doesn't work!
there was a sequel to this movie?
CAN YOU DO THAT? CAN YOU DIE TWICE?
You fool!
RUN

Reminds me of that pirate from Dead Man's Chest. The one with the shell for a head.
hmm, is this how they created Bane?
HE'S GONNA BE SO FUCKING ALIVE
>implying he managed to make it from Herbert's room to the office without anyone noticing the headless guy carrying the disembodied head.
what if he gets kicked in the balls?
looks like the same stuff
will he feel the pains
so uh
I remember hearing the term "I say Jump.You say How high". somewhere,but where?

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The bald, bearded doctor at the foot of Megan's bed who gets shoved away as Dan tries to revive her is underground cartoonist Kim Deitch ("The Boulevard of Broken Dreams"), son of legendary Jazz-era cartoonist Gene Deitch ("The Cat").

crying like a bitch
Scary is not the word
Deads gonna dead
NOO TITS! DON'T DIE!
SHES DEAD JIM. BUT THATS oKAY
She'll just show up in a closet somewhere later
because death means so much in a film where the dead come back every 10 seconds.
Death caused by being choked for 30 seconds, man she is fragile
no prob
SHE'S DEAD, JIM.
just dose her damn it
MANLY TEARS
07let's discuss it tomorrow
he goes back and revives her, doesn't he?
She was made of biscuit
"Okay we're going to need an actress who isn't afraid to show chest, multiple times, and isn't afraid of a rape scene that may or may not involve blood and zombie cunnilingus."
He can just reanimate her breasts?
You can always revive her
Death? NAH, I GOT THIS
fair enough
TIME TO USE THE GREEN ROCKS
well it was a ZOMBIE.
It's time to science her back to life!
NECRO!
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "brains" in the severed head were made up of steer meat by-products, ground beef and fake blood and when they shot the scene in the autopsy room with the severed head being thrown out the door and then smashing onto the hallway wall, the crew were all behind the cameras with garbage bags over their clothes because no one knew just how
lol
just saw her breath XD
i can be scarier than dis
LOL Darf14
reanimate the boobs
and then it turns into pet semetary
zombies have incresed strenfth?
Nyst Ahahahahahahaha, thats the best idea EVER!!!
it was't the choking that killed her, it was his bangin her head on ever door fram on the way in.
... necrophilia agen
No horror movie is complete without necrophilia.
WE CAN REBUILD HER

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTnyRZmYHnw
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yJoVQ0O6bg
that head rape scene I could have done without, but good movie otherwise
Where was Gondor when it ended like that?
I wonder if Abridged episode dubs are allowed.
That's better
Nice animation! Who did that?
This movie had so much wtf in it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDE2_D2WLEw&list=PL6A1BB1D70C97CB77&index=2&feature=plpp
I can see why this is the classic that it is
I HAVE A QUESTION!
never thought I'd say something like that...
Lol abridged episodes are amazing.
14Our mod Wrek made it for us
my request is related to the B movie. and it's depressing as hell.
requestin that video of mismashed pony clips with secret butt fun from preshow
I am completely shit at doing links....
you should get the fallout 3 menu music for when you show that derpy image
11ASK THE QUESTION!
Cool
WHERE WAS GONDOR DURING THE CREEPY AS HELL HEADLESS RAPE SCENE
Is that guy the reanimator from the next movie?
CAN WE WATCH MOSKAU! I WANNA SEE BAD POWER RANGER TYPE COSTUMES DANCE BETTER THAN ME
I'm loving the Mentally Advanced Series.
Every film needs a decapitated zombie head rape scene.

How do you post videos with thumbnails and information on them

My favorite part of this song is Fluttershy's first line. Just love the delivery of it.

14Ehhh... PurpleDoom.. XD
just copy/paste the link
This is the BEST kind of mood whiplash.

0This scene is what confirmed to me my absolute love of this show.
Whenever I do that, it shows up marked You Tube

11We give warning of nudity and sexual activity everytime the film is mentioned in all promotional material.

I love the Mentally Abridged version of this show.
spengberb you're thinking of oranges
11Discussion on multiple rooms
07indeed
Well, it's more of a "prevent things like Spider's Web from appearing"
14Whyd you use those colors PurpleDoom? :P
/me feels like a freak for not liking this song
HOLY CRAP PONIES
Prevent?
11Special event streaming
Why would you want to prevent Spider's Web?
I loved that film.

Not really.
Gosh darn cat.
meh, best song is Winter Wrap-Up
also
best episode
just saying
professional dress design=markers!
*bobs head to music*
Rarity made me actually look at fashion
wwu is best song
14If I see that darn cat one more time....
07switching to webchat.. brb
I don't know what you guys are talking about, this song is manly as fuck.
winter wrap-up is the best
Rainbow Tank is best Tank
Aaaw yeeaah
I loved Suited for Success, personally
MLP taught me what haut coture meant
ding
Rainbow dash is already a freaking tank
the rhyming in this song is terrible
totally broke up when she said tank.
I learned something
DSNesmith gotta disagree with that. I think "Dog and Pony SHow" is the best episode.
Perhaps the best part of this song is that every piece of anatomy is correctly named
The reprise of this song is my favorite because of the emotion the singer puts in her voice and the vocal harmonies
0abramsdash
as DaPS is a Rarity episode, I'll let you have that
11I know, bitch. I know.
11(Kidding)
i love a dog and a pony show i laughed my ass off
when I realized Pinkie was describing the sonic rainboom sequence to Twilight at the beginning of Griffon the Brush-off, my life was changed forever
(as in whoever dores Rarity's singing voice)
everyone but rarity was a bitch in dis episode, IMO
THIS IS WHIINIIIIIIIIIING
4BABY, I KNOW IT /Bender
rivets WAIT WHAT
thank celestia for ponies after that movie
It's somewhat worrisome that ponies know what a tank is.
07http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMrQcn-LiO0&feature=channel_video_title is a bit too long
DSNesmith I just can't not laugh at Rarity's whining.
14Pinkie is justr oblivious of course
Rarity has the best talking/singing voice.
dsnesmith you haven't noticed that? it's worth checking out
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsC4k72TqBs&list=FLa_AOeKMTYr6YaflscewOjQ&index=87&feature=plpp
Agreed, Aponymous.
still want to see at the gala orchestra http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pBrXu7yRTM
THANK YOU FOR PONIES AFTER THAT MOVIE LUNA!
the whining in that episode was really funny

Isn't Rarity's singing voice actress different?
14Streams it is
14HERE WE GO

Applejack and Pinkie make the least sense
I'm still wondering how Fluttershy's dress ended up like it did considering she at least seems to know what she's doing

thunder_dash have you ever seen real French haute cotour? looks like absolute crap
shes like wtf are you laughing at?
Octavia: I know right?
this episode is why Rarity goes crazy in rainboom
20% cooler. YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT!
i just told her ponies deal with it
WOOT
Fluttershy can sew, but she CAN'T design.
I bet they'd probably have liked their initial dresses more if they saw themselves in them.
Whoo hoo~
winterwrap up is the best ><

2,14 as much as I like this, I like the original version a bit better
^
>To woop
I don't really even like this.
Though.
To woop
It's more energtic, but I prefer the original.
DAT LAST PIANO BIT
aw
I didn't realize that was a lyric
0To woop
I love that song
The vocal version is the only one I can find
YEESSSS
It just seems the same but a bit faster.
Oh man
yessss this one's awesome
eh? don't know this song
That and that one remix.
I just love orchestral music.
Diabeetus INCOMING
Different opinions so I wont argue with dari
4WHAT
0it is?
flutterwonder
0Oh my god yes. This is soo pretty
This is great, yeah
I just think the Orchestra version has a much fuller sound to it.
14FLOOTAHSHAI <3
I love this
/me 4loves how dari doesn't like Pogo
is the name
The one mixed with Last Night Best Night or something like that.
4lolok
Fillyshy is cutest
Meh.
HNNNNNNNNNNNGH
wait
...Electronica remix?
I just don't think it's anything special.
Dang, another good one
i prefer that orchestral version - lot more energy behind it
did you say this is a pogo remix
Quite boring to me.
What is she saying?
POGO?
11EVERYONE! HUG GHOSTIES! *trollface*
I'm liking this a lot
the original "at the gala" just feels like they wanted to make it epic sounding, but didn't have enough time/resources to get it done
0PinkiePieSwear - Flutterwonder
Deep wide and wonder
2,14 this is new...what's this called luna?
dat plot
4There's more to the music than just how good it is
Fillyshy looks like she's going to collapse under her own weight
...
/me hugs Ghosties :D
flutterwonder
Ghosties wut
/me brohugs Ghosties
/me hugs Ghosties *TROLLFACE*
is this pogo
0Wait, what is this? I need to find this. Now.
seriously?
I love pogo
/me giggles at the ghosties instead
/me hugs Ghosties
If it's not good, then there's no point in listening to it.
2,14 RAWRity: At the Gala is a parody of Into the Woods, it's very intentional
Ghosties: agreed. the original version didn't seem strong enough to do justice to the event
aww ghosties, come here, we all know your a deep cuddly bear on the inside...
*Headbang*
Tell me.. what is this?
/me anti-hugs Ghosties
4Part of the reason why I love Pogo's stuff so much is because he managed to breathe new life into a lot of childhood movies
Not a parody. A homage.
Eye of the beholder, ect.
Pastiche, if you will.
if pogo is a brony
I will be so happy
lol wut

I am ALWAYS open for new pony music videos. I love them but know so little of them.

Re-Animator: Okay
ehh..well...I think this song i- LOOK OVER THERE A BEAR *runs*
True, RAWRity
This: What?
And at least 78% cooler than the real song.
yeeeeah
ahh, error
The only set of PMVs that I think measure up to PONIES: The Anthology http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJIt4TR5KtU&feature=related
i herd it
meanwhile, I'm watching the flutterwonder song again
woah
I really hope if they ever release an OST
now excuse me i need to death metal for a while
o_O
14Noise :p
oh god what
WTF?
/me freaks out.
that they do a full version of Equestrian Girls
this is as back as Gigi's WoW videos
11suddenly WTF NOISE!
DEATHMETAL GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
suddenly another video
bad*
because that would be awesome
The short big of Reanimator I saw makes me think it's bad in all the right ways.
needs me some bleeding through
she make wat clop clop?!
rawrity did you see the "giving head" scene
because that was bad in all the wrong ways
Derp it out?
How funny
herpy...?
derpy...?
2,14 if ditzy EVER talks like this in the show I'm going to shoot someone
Ok I am not clearly in the right mind set to hear this music, let me make some adjustments *hits head with hammer*
...
14:P
muffins...
derpy breaking it down
I want to make that background song in Show Stoppers where the CMC are going around town as my phone ringtone.
Wow, same here Caramel
... agreed, Caramel.
muuufin o3o
07I had some horrible stuff requested last week.. need to make sure it's not being streamed again
Caramel Just like you will freak out if anything involving Caramel and Seaponies appears.
I agree, Caramel.
07so i'm pre-viewing everything
seaponies? oh no.
SHOO BE DOO
07like now I had a movie vid from last movie...
well now that i am done with powermetal tell me when this vid is over
Agree with Caramel
07brrrr
Just 'cause she's derpy doesn't mean she has to talk like that.
2,14 Caramel stuff is great. Seaponies are evil
seaponies theme as ringtone
SHOOP SHOO BE DOO
Shoo be doo, Shoo shoo be doo
DSNesmith I did. Really, it's far from the worst I've seen. The hamminess of it all made it tolerable. Now "Serbian Film" is something completely different. It's disturbing and horrible without any redeeming cheesiness
brb
Aw, I missed the ending of Re-Animator. How'd that go?
That was wat
I need some spurs that jingle jangle jingle
: p
Seaponies in spanish!
11Wait... Caramel = ValtheJean?
2,14 it's *SHIPPING* I hate
That would be a horrible stereotype
don't even talk about serbian film
Luna, is the other one also too long?
Don't ask
<.< >.>
YAY
OH NO INCOMING HHHHNN NNNNNNG
HOLY SHIT
I'll be honest, I actually hope she never talks, period. "Muffins!" doesn't count because the line syncs up to two different ponies as well.
i just ate a muffin witch is funny
0oh fuck not this
/me 11's head asplodes
ooh yay!
HNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Caramel Oh, you mean like the stuff i write?
TOO MUCH CUTENESS
is it really surprising? >.<
/me falls asleep
Awww, I never get tired of that pic
11yes.
ahg the autotune, it burns!!!
thank god for this song
11to me.
HHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNG
but I already got diabeetus today D:
:(
oh snap its 5am already :(
Dat face. HHHHHHNNNNNNNNGGG
IT'S. TOO. ADORABLE. HEART. EXPLODING.
blood sugar... rising
Caramel Lucky you that I hate sea ponies too.

Ha ha! I'm immune to your fluttershy's!
this song is not helping my sleepyness
11I didn't notice until just now.
lol
well its 11pm here Luna!
with fire!
nightshade how strange, there's a line in here that says "It's 5 am and I need to sleep"
i think it should say butterflies and b from fluttershys point of view
autotune is like sugar, it's okay in moderation
yeah 6 am... glad I slept before BMN....
Dashite Orly? ACTIVATE PINKIEDASH
14lol XD
i hate owl city but fluttershy made this bearable
: /
is midnight over ere
11This vid: Fuckin' saved.
9 PM
Dang, most of the good fan songs involve fluttershy
I just figured that it was obvious, since I'm the only one who cares about Caramel :P
I literally woke up right when BMN was starting, how's that for luck?
Denied_Existence take your best shot.
0Midnight here as well.
10,000 pegasi, DAWWWW
i could do with some sleep but im nocturnal and an insomniac XD
0I'm avoiding Nightmare Moon as we speak.
0The lights keep her away.
so many different time zoned bronies, i like it
11I care about Caramel.
10,000 Fluttershys = instant heart exploding.
<3
INSOMNIACS UNITE!!!!!
11I've actually considered RPing him, but then I found two other people had the same exact idea at the same time.
/me brohoofs DecapKing
: D
Ponies don't have a nightlife :(
I really want to make a live-action video for this song, but I know damn well I won't eve do it.
O_o
But it's only just after midnight, it's not insomniac time yet...
I don't have a daylife XD
12 am here, for those who are curious.
10k Flootershai might actually give me diabeetus
11in /rp/ of POnychan.
We should have played this RIGHT AFTER Re-Animator, the mood whiplash would have been delicious.
/me brohoofs Thunder Dash back
fireflies is 20% cooler
just hit midnight! can't sleep, still need to do something for my napowrimo
0There's nightlife in Manehattan.
ah, that would explain why I never saw it
0Go there.
10000 butter-yellow ponies suddenly appeared over the world's capitals today. In other news, world peace has been declared and Rarity is best pony.
Dashite sunrise will be upon me soon here in Merry old England
10 million Fluttershys? HHHHNNNNNGGG
10k Fluttershy's all going SQUEEK at the same time...
so wait, you frequent /rp/ then. Do you know what happened to !!Scootaloo?
10 million is too few
hhhhhhhnnnnnnnnnnnngggggg
Indeed
Why do people keep saying 10,000? It's 10,000,000...
nyst, still wouldn't be that loud
need 10 quadrillion
11not a clue to be honest.
We need like 5 billion Fluttershies.
Feh, it's only 9 here fun doesn't start till at least midnight in Vegas.
NightShade, :D
10^10^10^10^10
manly hugs! I'm out... got to do some work b4 its too hot.
0 10 Gazillion

Dashite; one part of the lyrics says 10 thousand
Fractal Fluttershy.
11I was never in the same threads as Chickenmod
Needs moar Flootershai
it's frustrating
i hate the song this is based on
seriously
10million X pi
we need moar metal PMVs....
I take a break from ponychan for like...a wekk

had to listen to it constantly at work
10 Brazillion Flootershys
/me 11calls !!scootaloo chickenmod
lemonloaf hates art of the dress

0Needs moar of Da Magikz!
I question your taste in music
and when I get back apparently this giant shitstorm involving !!scootz happened
and yeah I figured :P
10 Brazillian Fluttershy's O.o
okay, you took asleep, fireflies and fall and jumbled them around into a song
i heards clicking
lol at end
gratz
My plan for a vid of this song would be to have a brony fall asleep at their comp late at night, dream of fluttershy, wake up disappointed, find /somebody/ put a blanket on them in the night, then the camera pans out to a hoof track on the ground

*One headbang*
yeah, this isn't really doing much for me
the singer is not power metal, the rest is meh
we need a Hammerfall treatment of this song
we need a facemetling woaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah in this song
Caramel Well compared to the CMC's singing, its godly.
I like Power Metal, but this isn't much of an improvement.
we need the facemelter
Oh daribot.
2,14Yes, but there's a difference between purposefull singing bad, denied, and just being a bad singer :P

I was using my keyboard, I can't dance worth crap :P
marzai and all of that, when the show hasn't even been around for a year!
lol
0That's right.
dat timer
Marzai; and to top that off I can't think of a single other fanbase in the world that's this welcoming
so i assume mine ain't coming very soon?
what's the countdown for? i was away for a while and kinda missed a lot
0Yep.
Marzai, are you saying we make more than any other fanbase?
rather not sleep listening to slipknot :P
me when i use to play this i pulled off all kinds of tricks and didnt just stomp my feet fast
or Resurrection by Chimaira
0I think so, yes.
there's probably more hours of bronie made content than there is official original content
0Not just make more, but DO more.
We're pretty close If nothing else
cool thanks
"probably"
I think Touhou has made more than us
0Us bronies are awesome.
GAbeMoist Probably rivals the furry fandom at this point
0We even got podcasts.
also are requests being taken?

/me 14comes in
dat violin
Operating under the assumption that Luna is choosing the vids, Thanks immensely for choosing one of the "My Little Failures". I've been trying to spread the word of that series for months and it seems that people really dug it.
Luna: try to get mine to finish before 1 if possible
0And tighten your buttox.
And there it is
that's not a violin, silly
unless the ponies are REALLY small
biggest fucking violin ive ever seen
Violin Octavia not double bass.
did I just hear "poor juice on your genitals"?
Und mich?
11Okay, with the exception of interviews, I am all caught up.
Er...mir?
14Cello actually :P And I play the violin too ;)
Nuh.....NO!
the line is "pour juice on your chin"
who plays the cello standing up?
Well, Furry is more of an over fandom, since it's not one series. That'd be like calling anime fans one fandom.
I played the cello for a year
14Thats what Jayson said it was
Wtf. I come back to this thread to see "pour juice on your genitals".
What do you call bad weather in Thunderbluff?

This is the only fate it deserves.
so did you guys see the full suit Pony cosplay?
it's really catchy, you have to admit
LOCK IT UP. PUT IT IN A BOX. BURY THE BOX. BUILD A HOUSE OVER THE HOLE. LIVE IN THE HOUSE.
>pony cosplay
>mfw
I leave to go take a shower, and when I come back this is what I see.
...
DO THAT TO THIS VID
SEND ME O'S
:0
OH GOD SUMIC Don't remind me...PLEASE
0I have seen full-suit pony cosplay.
I'm okay with this.
2,14Thank you sumica....for returning the image I tried to burn out of my memory
0And that's a barrier that must NOT be breached.
HELL YEAH
14SWAG
i hate cosplay
YES
THIS SHIt'S DIVINE
hahahaha
DIE!!!!!!!
no not the kids show and my plesure
SOMEONE. REQUEST THE LIVE MLP FIM SHOW.
Timez for some swagz
DIE YOU SSONG FROM HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly, some of the full-suit pony cosplay I've seen is actually pretty good.
oh. its done
Especially this one Rainbow Dash outfit that was going around for a while.
I fucking love this song. :0
the suit look good but it's um borderline furry.
thank celestia
...
No herospirit, I will learn hacking skills, hack the site, and take it down before I let that happen
BLOAW
/me sings along
Denied.... you just revealed your weakness to me.
all male cosplayers deserve surprise total genitilia casteration. i say only male because im not sure how it would apply to females
yes, everyone suggest the live show
hey we were missing some people tonight
live MLP show? Why do my nipples tingle in fear now?
where was bjornfot?
herospirit I am fairly sure that is not a weakness I am alone in
i really like this song, but the edited ohmygosh from dash just doesnt seem to fit.
2,14 that's...a little extreme patrik...
Definitely dancing in my seat
I've actually contemplated getting into cosplay before.
0Mr_PATRIK, we would have to cut off their breasts.
>a little
0Simple.
Go google it RAWRity or yootube
the only thing I would change is the little bit in the middle
tell me why i have to be a power slave.... i dont wanna die im a god whay cant i live on...
The only character I could pull off though was Booster from Super Mario RPG.
where he wants to kill the SA guy
ahh yes, i saw that on national geographic oncd
DuskShine We aren't talking about just regular cosplay...this was more of a live show...
it seems... unbronylike
sumica I'd rather not. it sounds like I wouldn't be able to sleep.
suddenly, people advocating genital mutilation... wtf happened while I napped? :P
that or wait till Dari feels like trolling us again.
Check your PM DuskShine
lol SA
Hmm?
... I don't have any PMs.
Now you do
mothers in africa somewhere iron their prepudecent daughters breasts so the guys would not be attracted to them
Oh there it is.
RobotPinkie some guy has a really negative opinion of Cosplayers
hey luna let's watch the best movie ever
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUli1YWL21E
The live action show you showed us the other morning.
SWAG.
swag
I see no problem with cosplay. :0
k... well I think cosplay looks fun, even if I've never tried it.
cosplay=/=full body suit
0I have no problem with cosplayers.
cosplays fun if you dont get too serious about it.
ooh audiosurf
WOOOOOOOOOT
0Serious = ?
doesn't look like a very intense track honestly
like, uptight aand stuff
neither do I. It's not something I'd ever do, bu I don't see any problems with it.
i suggest genitilia mutiliation only becuase i am too tired to think of anything else
what's the hardest audiosurf songs you guys have ever played?
Aaw right
14SO MUCH YAYY~
2,14 I don't get this...is it just a game that you can listen to music while you move around?
I don't have a problem with cosplay, I've actually done it once before... I think last year?
ive seen many a good time ruined by a cosplayer either bragging or complaining.
I love doing Drum and Bass stuff on Audiosurf
"anything else"
Pendulum rocks
Suddenly fail?
hold your color on ninja ironmode is hardcore
i just do not like cosplay. its creepy to me
I'd cosplay, but it'd have to be flawless or I wouldn't be satisfied
>implying people should be mutilated for having a hobby
It's basically a racing game or something that generates tracks via songs.
I think.
we already watch this, like 3 seconds ago
the video derped
Er...wrong chat box
Though... I barely had to put any effort into it because the character I was looks a lot like me
DSNesmith WOOT PENDULUM
this song is pretty mellow....
HELL YEAH PENDULUM
I've done 2 cosplays, and they were simple, a shirt, and hair dye
brohoof
/me is very high on pepsi.
It's really cool when people sew these elaborate costumes from some show, I think.
F-zero GX music and this game go very, very well together.
/me brohoofs DSNesmith!
This game looks fun.
I possibly could beat that song w/o hitting a grey.
this game IS fun
and steam puts it on sale for like 2$ all the time
I'm confused, what are these fullbody suits people are talking about?
Osc-Sync Carnival in particular generates some pretty fun tracks, from what I recall.
fursuits?
/me has ninja ironmoded this song already
0Those are called Fursuits.
Rawrity I would link but there are fillies present
those can get creepy
0Where you dress up as an animal.
yay
I've had Audiosurf for quite a while and have a lot of hours of play logged on it.
RAWRity, everyone else was talking about a live showing of MLP that went on in Canada a few months back, I think.
fursuit is the general term for full-body suits
/me makes a not to not bring up cosplay again
note*
Rawrity Think like a mascot uniform
0Depending on the design, they can be really awesome, or nightmarishly creepy.
exactly
the only thing that sucks about audiosurf is that ninja never gets the high score
Eeeeeeeyup, have a few furry friends myself.
that's true, Marzai
oh, furries. I really don't understand the internet's problem with them. So they've got a kink I'm not into, big deal. As long as it's consenting adults, do whatever you want in your bedroom.
Yeah, for example, you could totally cosplay as Teddie from Persona 4 in a full-body suit and it wouldn't be creepy at all
Learned a lot of interesting things from them...and some creepy stuff too.
>mfw OOOOH those are NFL logos, not the NHL ones
HAHAHAHAHA
ooh that's brilliant...
is htis the 8minute version
this is long
woah, just noticed my computer says im disconnected from the network...
I need food.
yay
WOO STEVKINGS!
has anyone seen hipster lately?
:)
this is nice and all, but can we move on?
What are we counting down until?
RAWRity; I completely agree
I haven't seen yellow text all night
Haven't seen Hipster since last week.
no it ain't DSNesmith
or purple now that I think of it
/me is back and rageing
I think he was abducted by ponies
what's the timer for?
dumb isp
or blue!
that's just the the song in game form
rainbrodash is also MIA
eh
Its the timer until Luna heads to sleep
my mods are disappearing -.-
don't worry
HAH
I love that part right at the end with no music in the background.
14WTF COLLECTIVE
14YAYY

I'll probably head to bed soon.
LOL. A Ponified WTF collective?
/me wonders if he's starting to think liek a Doctor
>mfw TIMER RESET

>mfw I still don't know the diamond dog names
xDDD
hehehe
Rover, Fido, and Spot.

D:
It wasn't originally ponified, of course :p
/me 14is waiting for them to make a third... I hope

0It's ironic.

MC Vagina will be amazing
the ponified ones are better honestly

0Because it's ironic!2
You can't spell chorus without.... VAGINA.

well, either of them, then :P
there were 3. wait, 4. 5 now maybe.

Can't complain.
You?

I remember I found it via a thread on another forum I frequent, it was about 30 pages long and I watched half of the first ep
Sad I missed the actual movies and episodes
But not too bad
Apparantly
0Doing great. The plans for Nightmare Moon's return are going smoo--
I said I was gonna watch, played minecraft, and came back to a brony community
0Crap.
I think it works best if you know nothing about the series going in except that people love it
Damn it Marzai! We talked about this!
didn't really like it that much TBH, few weeks later noticed it was >50 pages, decided to check it out properly
Looks like someone's gonna be found out.
....... :3
No revealing our organization's evil plans!
... im still not sure wtf im watching
AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
0I'm sorry, Kojin!
Not coll marzai... not cool...
Marzai Careful, creating Nyx would be toxic for Caramel/Val
0><;
Man, so much Swedish stuff we get on the stream...
marzai plans to create alicorn OCs
My mom thinks i'm a sissy because of this
2,14 *cough*

RATATATT

ULTIMATE Showdown of Ultimate Destiny!
LOLOLOL
As always Luna, thanks for streaming ;)
lol optimus prime
And then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White
and only one will survive
I always tripped up on the blue meanie
ULTIMATE FOALDOWN OF ULTIMATE DESPONY
And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight
Wonder who'll be Chuck Norris..
And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanine
lol
Cowbow Curtis and Jambie the Genie
This is too perfect
2,14 and with that introduction, I shall call it a night. Good night my fellow bronies
I got the whole thing memorized. Same with the 50 states.
... and then I forget.
night caramel
I'm sure Celestia would be Chuck Norris... or maybe Trixie?
0Abraham Lincoln?
Night Carmael
Nighty night Caramel! -hugs-
Caramel*

G'night Caramel!

*bro-hoof*
then angles sang out, in an emanculate chorus, down from the heavens decended chuch norris
0I wonder who'll be Mr. Rogers...
here we go
LOL
no surprise there
0No, Chuck Norris is like Trixie - All boast, no badassery.
luna = mr rogers obviously
I knew it!
Mr. Rogers should be, like, snips or snails
HERE WE GO
0Snails.
0Yeah, he should.
Brohoof returned.
cowboy braeburn
Ursa Major fit
out of context that dead "mouse" actually looks pretty violent
0The timer ftw...
lol
Yeah spike
Mr. Rogers in a blood stained sweater
...
spike is winner
carebears vs ponies though
>Knew Spike would win, like a boss
that'd be a battle for the ages
0Oh, man.
0That would.
LIKE A BAWS
BAWZ
Ponies would win so easily
0THAT would require popcorn.
giant rainbow beams
Mr. Rogers really is the ultimate badass.
0Spike's not like a boss, he is the boss.
oh yay!
firing everywhere
/me hugs Luna
acapella pony theme?
OH THIS SONg
i love this song
Acapella WWU?
Huh.
THOSANDJosh: This is true.
We need some LIKE A BOSS
this is amazing
:D
"Are You Proud To be A Brony"
THIS IS MY FAV SONG
I remember this stage
then I said
fuck it
went out and bought all mane6
they sit proudly on my desktop in the dorm now
nice, DSNesmith :P
blind bags or brushables?
brushies
I only have Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy sitting on the shelf above my computer right now D:
0Wow.
*Sqeeee*
dat squeak
0I b trollin!
Instant hnnnnng
Squee <3
0I love this song now.
my floor is going on a target run tomorrow, I'm gonna try to pick up cheerilee
I'd prefer blind bag, not a fan of brushies
the brushies are kinda fun
it's a little DIY
I have the mane 6 brushables too, I like them a lot
pinkie's the easiest to do
God damn it's late for Luna.
twilight is so harrrrd
yeah, it's fun to style
have blind bag set from toys r us, brushables, custom Celestia & Nightmare Moon
I sort of want plushies.
Well
and RARITY, dear god
It's late for me too.
way too much pony
07>implying it's not late for you?
0 1:23 AM.
07:D
lol
I went to a brony meet-up last week, and there were some of the toys there. I started brushing one of their hairs, and I must admit it was kinda' Zen
it's late for everyone not on the west coast
It's only 10:24 PM here. I usually don't go to sleep until 4:00 AM.
Luna stayes up all night like THE boss
Still not going to get any of the actual toye though
*toys
any other CWRU bronies here by chance?
0Lawl.
I'm not THAT much of a brony
CWRU?
uni
I think I might leave soon.
Get some sleep. XD
DAMN RIGHT she'd make it in a fight
thanks so much for streaming, Luna. been working perfectly for me almost the entire time
kojin give it time
Who's controlling the stream anyway?
07great robot :)
>scootaloo stands next to dash
>adorable
Luna is
This is only my second time here
Cool
Hi Luna!
and when it didn't, it was because my browser suddenly died :P
Dr. Horrible, nice.
seriously though spider's web
Haha! Dr. Horrible!
07noooo
07dont ever name that!
oh oh can i steam Burn notice =p
ooh, I love this
this vid is waht got me to watch Dr. Horrible
Woot Dr Horrible
I cannot believe my eeeeeyes
THE PIE DISAPPEARED BECAUSE ANCIENT ALIENS
I have a question
Which one?
Rainbow Dash being voiced by a gay man. That's totally not indicative of anything.
07spiders thing...
^haha.
nah
this video compells me to kick little puppies
0So... how's everyone doing?
I honestly didn't think I'd like Dr. Horrible as much as I did.
A gay man who plays an amazing stright one.
Good, yourself?
0I'm doing fine.
OH GOD THE SPIDERSES
well, rainbow dash is also apparently in love with TS too in this so...
ACH!!!
not that spider thing
a worse spider thing
Seriously, he could get any girl he wanted if he swung that way
0I await the arrival of the dark ruler, Nightmare Moon. Only a matter of time...
*Shiver*
Sleepy.
I didn't like it quite as much as I thought I would; judging from the hype
oh, twilight, that idealism will get you killed someday
0I'm doing great. Just sitting here reading comments and watching a video.
DHSAB was okay
Dash is Horrible, Twi is I can't remember her name, WHO IS CAPTAIN HAMMER?
it had a couple really good songs
not quite cracked up to the hype though
I liked it, to be sure.
I was a little iffy on part 1 of Horrible, but once THIS song came on, I started getting into it.
Apony, Penny
apple jack is captain hammer
I find Joss Whedon to be a bit overhyped in general
and I'll never forgive him for Alien 4
>applejack has a penis
you hurt me
with your implications
Wait....waht?
Applejack with Nathan Fillion's voice, SO MUCH WANT.
dat repeat
Applejack does have a penis, but only when genderbent.
How did we reach this conclusion?
wooo Dr. Whoof!
DSNesmith Dr. horrible is the only thing I've ever watched by Whedon
And when she's genderbent, her name is... Applejack.
Joss Whedon is definitely overrated, but not for Dr Horrible... :P
DSNesmith = You are aware that his script went through intense executive mandate?
hmmm, what's this?
Avenue Q <3

Oh lord, RD is Rod
Er....wait did I say writer? I meant artist...

Toot spam was epic tonight

YAY!
WOOOOT
> Anthology
<3
last video is 20 minutes
epic
wow this is a long vid :O
Maybe I'm alone in this, but I actually like Kanye West's music.
And now to the video that got me started on ponies
rawrity I like THIS song
mostly because I associate it with ponies now
I like this song with this video
I don't hate this song, which is the best anyone can get out of me when it comes to rap
RAWRity: I love Kanye, MBDTF was amazing.
I like Power, but that's about it.
RAWRity = Kanye West is a great musician. He just also happens to be an asshole
I actually like pretty much all of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"
Thunder_Dash, Second
the full version of POWER isn't very good
the parts that aren't like this bit suck
^Yeah, I only have the shortened version
i feel special, not just because my mommy says so, but my request has been accepted. :3
even if it may have been pre-determined
Really, my fav Kanye songs are "Lost In The World" and "So Appalled". Monster would be good if Nicki Minaj didn't ruin it.
I'll take this as my exit. See everypony tomorrow for the drawing.
NANANANANA

"In this trailer, I will state basic facts about physics"
Love ya Luna! Get some sleep, you deserve it.

Take care Luna

MOVE BITCH

I always think of hancock at that

whazzzzzuuuuuup
Is Nicholas Cage still in it? Or is it a reboot thing?
chili bowl...

emodash!
they pick person from the list of those online Thunder_Dash that persons gets to pick one of the things we watch the next week
no, a sequel
lol gingers
that kid is hilarious
mmm, rarity
Cage was the only amusing part of the first one, might bootleg. Hopes aren't high though.
sing more darling
seceret butt fun
so I wanted Wicker Man for the bad movie a few weeks ago
I will repeat, there's a piss joke in the very first joke.
but was denied
but i still haven't heard about their event
Sumica; Alright, thanks :3
BLARG
so when're we watching the greatest Nic Cage film ever made?
that exists?
*Snap* *Snap*
mmm, this song
Yeah, like I said, hopes aren't high. Cage is usually amusing in bad movies though.
4 Just know that we've got things in the work, DSN
if I get to choose the B-movie, I'm either going with "Birdemic" or "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
oh wow Birdemic
that's... special
suddenly Galadrarity
OH GOD LOTR FLASHBACKS
I gotta say again though
that was the best LOTR marathon ever
Yeah
You cant flash back to a week ago
DSNesmith; I AGREE. :D
i think I'll go with "Nudist Colony Of The Dead" though, because that is just hilariously awful
Sumic Watch me!!!!

note to self; get up at 5 AM on Sept. 17th so I can see the stream
Dead Kennedys!
trollightsparkle: actually pretty sure it'll be the day they get the most viewers of the Hub ever
I wish my cable guide went to the 17th so i can set the timer for it

RAWRity: *Ponies
Likewise, DSN.
>mfw when I found out I have Hub at my house
07Also we are still recruiting
i have charter, but no HUB. my friend has the crappy small town cable provider we have here, and he has it
07should you be interested please e-mail us
/me does not have The Hub because he switched to Cable the last time he moved.
0._.
Luna.. e-mail to where?
I knew I had hub before I liked Ponies.
oh oh me luna...er wait =p
that scene is funny because horses cant vomit
07bronystate@gmail.com
duskshine what cable provider do you use?
I don't find this song amusing at all tbh
Alright.. I'll consider it, thanks
07We are looking for streamers and moderators
I have Charter and I have Hub.
Don't remember, but they're also the ones who provide us with our internet. One second...
what does being a moderator entail?
Mr_PATRIK But horses don't have magic nor sentience...soooo the rules are kinda altered.
_____ GENERATION
I'm still considering applying for moddyness.
love this song. got me into Osaka Popstar
It's Charter.
WEEE WUUU
unicorns have magic, not earth ponies
I would love to stream but my PC can't handle it
I... I might actually have The Hub!
4Hard work, dedication, determination, and pretty colors
I've tested and it's horribly slow
/me cries tears of joy.
07thanks Ghosties
4That last post was directed at RAWRity
07:)
4No prob : D
/me was writing.. :P
> mfeverytime I remember I can only watch MLP on either the internet or Treehouse
I though the same thing DSN, it's lower requirements then you would think.
I could probably stream, but only when I finish building my new rig.
ah've got a golden tickeeeeet
hm, how MUCH hard work?
because of the golden ticket!
4WEll
Mr_PATRICK Pegasi can stand on clouds, thats magic.
4I've been here since the beginning
4So
Sumica, I've set up a livestream and it was soooo slow :/
4It eats up your weekends, usually
MORE PONY SWAG WHAT
Mr_PATRIK*
ahh oki
TO EQD MY FRIENDS
Head bobbing time
My gods, do you know what this means? I could watch not only Friendship is Magic, but Batman Beyond AND Batman: The Animated Series!
07omnomnom weekends

the Hub is fast becoming the best channel on the air
Duskshine I'M EXCITED THAT YOU'RE EXCITED.
HARVEY DENT
earth ponies have no magic abilities whatsoever

Flashback to few hours ago!
> Batman: TAS on Hub
07if only it was available in europe...
D:
This is relevant to our viewings tonight
I HATED MY FATHER
I HATED my father
ROLLING
4Except that the Hub won't be BEST, until it has Adventure Time. Good luck on the Hub ever obtaining the rights to it
07lol ghost
and Courage the Cowardly Dog
Cn is not gonna let go of that one
I never knew my father...:*(
Eugh, Adventure Time.
07I streamed adventure time earlier
Adventure Time is.. strange.
SPACE
Don't like it. ^
The only things it's missing are the rest of the DCAU, Adventure Time, and Regular Show.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCEEEEEE
It's just strange.
CN and the Hub merge, they put the Hasbro people in charge
God, why is this part so LOUD?
Portal 2 <3
CN regains its title as the greatest animation channel ever
Because you're the best
regular show is better\
I don't expect the latter two to ever get on it, but the rest of the DCAU could probably show up.
it's more strange they are gonna do a rule 63 ep of adventure time
4Yes, and Courage the Cowardly Dog
I saw that.
CN is actually gettin better again
And I immediately thought "WTF."
I think they have new management
THey did.
4If Hub can get both Adventure Time and Courage the Cowardly Dog, THEN it's best
/me still really wants to see some Pink Pony shorts.
and KND
yes they did
and Samurai Jack
Oh Courage.
man, 90s Cartoon Network
That show made it hard to sleep lol
/me 4does not care for Kids Next Door
ding.
I've never really gotten into Adventure Time. I really liked KND though.
oh man i loved Samurai jack
90's in general DNS
GOODNIGHT EVERYBRONY THEN
Samurai Jack was glorious
4Nor does he care for Samurai Jack much, even though he respects it
Goodnight Dermathil!
4Goodnight Dermathil
hope Tartakovsky gets the movie made
Goodnight Dermathil
Night!
night dermathil
Puttin on the RITZ
Samurai Jack is KING!!
hehehe
Bye Dermathil
Kids Next Door was one of the many things that made me say "MARK HAMMILL WAS IN THIS?"
Night Darmathil!
lol
Dermathil, even
By Dermathil
"WHY DOES MARK HAMILL ALWAYS PLAY VILLAINS?"
cyall in about 5-6 hours
I can type, I swear.
Samurai Jack was brilliant, as was Star Wars: Clone Wars
Bye*
I liked Billy and Mandy
Night Dermathil
cause he's good at it
spaaaaaaace
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
and he played the good guy in wingcommander
Are you space?
Pinkiecore is best core
dad are you space?

Pinkiecore IS best core
Getting bored of space.
someone SERIOUSLY needs to mod a pinkiecore into Portal 2
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!111!!!!1!!!!ELEVEN
Samurai Jack is my favorite CN show, I'm still waiting on that movie that'll never come out.
Mark hamill did an absolutely amazing job as Ozai in Avatar: The Last Airbender
Did you see the Pinkie Sphere?
they already have it in sorce
aponymous it's actually in development now
well
Lol, this song
Raocow actually launched into a mini-rant in one of his videos over that Portal 2 meme.
a higher circle of development hell, anyway
Really Dusk?
What video?
Apparently he can't say the word "space" anymore without getting tons of comments about how he referenced Portal 2, despite having never played it before.
Original Pranksta'
Which I'm also looking forward to the new A:TLA series coming out next year.
yeah, Korra
huhuh
OMG yes new Avatar
although it's supposed to be way shorter than the first series
like 20 episodes or something
Yeah.. I know :/
DSNesmith: Has there been any news about it? Last I heard was that JJ Abrahms jumped on, and that was two years ago.
So just one season, then?
I heard SOMETHING about it last year

>implications
MARTHA JONES
Spiffing joke.
>implied racism
"what a witty joke, sir blueblood!"
>overt racism
her fucket over his head?
LOL DSNesmith
I'm here, Sumi.

so many books
I appear to be holding your books
"these books are MINE"
Smith? wrong doctor show
oh WOW, rawrity
no wonder twi has a thing for the good doctor
MY BOOKS MOTHER F**KER!

50s
Hi Sol
/me fights dsnesmith for books
or was it 60s
LOL
I warned you bro
so many stairs
XD
actually it was a reference to Matt Smith
SORRY RIGHT YEA
he's not alright
he's dead
oh I thought you meant Doctor Smith
from Lost in Space
Matt Smith? Who is he? He doesn't exist.
Deny what?
He exists man, sorry to tell ya
Dont bring up the 11th to Dari
I have no idea what you're talking about.
>implying any 19th century gentleman would have hair like tennant's
You've just got to except it.
*accept
those are pretty cool sketches
was that cthullhu?
lol, Rose is just a character
what happened to her anyway?
something about drugs probably
Lawl
Rose got trapped in a paralel universe.
that's a bit... dark
he just left her there?
Well she's there with her father, who died.
And her mother.
oh
still
And her ex boyfriend.
bit dark
because those aren't the people she remembers
Yeah they are.
The woman who's her mother in the paralel universe died.
but think of all the memories she has that never happened in that universe
We're dealing with show with 40 years of continuity, things are going to get complicated
Her actual mother from her universe is in the other universe with her.
Blueblood's a dick
Rose doesn't exist in the other universe.
none for the filth
he shall eat common carnival fare
I'M PARCHED. AND A DOUCHEBAG
do they really go into space that much
or just parallel earths
Incomeing!
They never go to parallel earths.
I've never really watched the show regularly
Because it's impossible.
Except they did once.
Hey, how do I put images in here and also, is it okay if I link to one?
no? I remember one with robomen
Because the TARDIS derped.
Hey nice ship, why dose your lic plate say Probeyou
th...th...the everfree forest!
Hey, didn't Neil Gaiman write an episode of Dr. Who?
Alternate dimentions are alternate timelines anyway
rocks dont fall up
y'can't just run off!
Blueblood is screwed.
you cant run off in to the dark, how will i find you
this isn't blueblood
this is his crony
that guy's creepy looking
LET'S INVESTIGATE
look at his face
Sound travels faster at night. It might be all the way to Mexico by now.
no you didn't
He's not got much brains
SHAGGY YOU GO LEFT
man, white ppl in front of aliens are like deers cought in headlights
dat forcefield
DED
OOOH purty lights
8touch*
bang your head on it doofus
i'm british and what is this?
it's wonder woman's plane
i got the magic touch
HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN
good think it's not one of those zap your arse forcefields
QUICK. PISS ON IT.
crunchatize me capn
DAT EFFECT
BENT
did he just call himself a wanker
Get bent?
Bender
So did I hear wrong, or didn't Neil Gaiman write an episode for Who?
LOL
I don't know RAWRity
AWWWWWWWWWWW
wouldn't doubt it
that was a funny face
IIRC it's something like "The Good Doctor's Wife" or something along those lines
Grape face on
"Bent, you're looking a bit stranger than usual."
so is this where the little mind reader sees thought the disguise.
his mind's been pheckid
aliens that turn young lads to pedos, thats new
You gonna get hazed
>finds alien ship in woods
in the bum
>walks inside
>natural selection at work
How dare you Martha.
The TARDIS is alive.

Awkward way to end a conversation.
we're teaching kids how to use maxim mahine guns
Redfort... redheart....
oh this dosent look bad at all
Considering how much respect I got at school if kids didn't get in trouble for violence I probably would've gotten beaten </emo>
"You remind me of my husband getting shot" what.
battle of spy on cock?

/me kicks dermathil in the crotch
I honestly don't care about these 1913 people
You Don't want to do that MrDrProfBrony
i'm exhausted, so I'll be heading to the lands of 10,000 fluttershys
mmm... sounds nice
I think I'll join you
THAT IS MOST IMPROPER!

/me is definitely having his thought processes modified by watching too much Doctor Who
/me has no mental workings
WALTZ
heheheh
I love Waltz.
AHA!
funny sounding waltz
Eh. The only waltz I like is the Rocket Jump Waltz, which technically isn't a waltz.
I have found the problem. MrDrProfBrony, your problem is that you don't have a mind!
SCARECROW
/me head implodes forming a mind
OH GOD I CAN SEE FOREVER
thanks to Dr. Who I'm now going to say "ALLONS-Y!" as a catchphrase
I CAN IMAGINE EVERYTHING

The aliens confronted the Doctor.
Told him either Martha or the Matron would die.
If he didn't change back.

So... why did he become human in the first place?
He doesn't understand.

>pacifist doctor with a gun

Ciao, Anon.
Love ya!
>doctor DOESN'T SHOOT
it's super effective
yep

VICTORY!
14Now thats kinda funny. What a small world it is.
It'S A TRAP!
Killed no one.
She's all evil and stuff
super evil
and dead
oh lord
i hate funny people
LASER'D
pew
And then he was murdered.
FEUER FREI
SOMEONE doesn't like humor
14Some Brony friends I'm moving in with are having a big Brony party during the premier of S2. And they are going to be tuning into the stream here to watch it. I didnt know that. lol
fuck that noise, she would be dead
nice, Octavia.
That's awesome, Octavia.
YOu can tell 'em you'Re mod there
Moving in with? Cool.
lol scarecrow people
Nice. hope they like it
Awesome, Octavia :D
I wish i lived anywhere near any other bronies
14Yeah, its a Brony house.
awww :)
Brony house is best house
That's awesome.
I feel happy to be here then :)
14I'll have to kinda miss the party of course since I'll be a little preoccupied on here. But I still thought that was funny.
sounds like a frat
I don't know any IRL bronies.
neither do i
same here
Likewise dari, but then I'm a colossal recluse.
i converted one
14Dallas Brony meet I went to a little back had 60 Bronies lol
dari, neither do I
My friends like the show but not enough to call themselves bronies
DOOP
I know a couple from my youth group.
boop
beep\
boop
my best friend is a brony, I've told one of my other friends about the show, and one of my former friends saw an episode and didn't like it (I say former friend because even without that he was a douche, to be honest)
beep beep
ello
if they saw the show, just bust out a brushable and they'll be jelly
my friends think im weird for watching a pony show...
-_-
i'm a closet brony
and my brother found out
I'm closet too.
AND PROUD TO BE
Well I told my family.
nice
I never wanted a brushable, i like the molded plastics better
But I haven't told any of my friends yet.
im afraid to tell my family
I'm in the exact same position as Dari
its not that big of a deal
My parents know, my mom's seen a bit and liked it, my dad doesn't really care, and I'm a social recluse so the only other people who know (IRL) are some of my school friends
I am attempting a slow, psychological approach to making all my friends bronys.
my brother is hugely anti brony
What does your family think, Dari?
but its brushable ^.^
I got them to concede that it's no different than football in a way
Other than my dad with "my little porny" they weren't bothered.
so...
oh right I remember dat dari
my brother is HUGE brony
That was pretty funny though.
14My parents dont care what I like or do. lol Plus I dont live with them which helps. And my friends are all cool in that they are all nerds and geeks like me in those regards
It will be the greatest psychological experiment of my life so far.
wat are we watching?
applebloommare i'm jelly
Dr. Who
ahhh Dr. Whooves
Who?
14:p
my brother said the show was gay and that it was retarded
How are you doing so, Denied_Existence?
sound board dari do it
Yes
i said that he has his opinions and i have mine
<--- anime otaku. collected cute things since i was 14
14My ass is gay and retarded
An excelent argument, Prof brony
Stage 1: Introduce them to this "Weird" fandom that has popped up.
Gaytarded
wow that hold it line is so wrong without context.
THE WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HE IS LIKE FIRE
AND IC
AND RAGE
mrdrprofbrony: really now?
THE NIGHT
THE STORM IN THE HEART OF THE SUN
Stage 2: Continue to drop hints and marvel at the "Strangness
yes
"Strangness of this spreading fandom"
he never mentioned it again
Scaresplosion
Mrdrprofbrony. do you like MLP?
yes
then thats all that matters
i know
14"Do you like ponies, non-Brony?" *Spongbob face*
I have only gotten to Stage 2 so far.
14Oh wait, I worded that wrong lol
Wait we have stages?
what is stage 2 again?
14"You like ponies, dont you non-Brony? There lol
D_E; That's what I tried with two of my interweb friends, one of them's a massive prick about it (though other than that he's fine), and the other guy doesn't care (but in contrast he's a prick about everything else)
No, stages of my Psychological experiment
ahh
brb
Is this the B movie?
Thunder_Dash Well I guess you're surrounded by a bunch of dicks, but no pussies *Bum* *Bum* *Tish*
this is Dr. Who
XD

And you ALREADY KNOW THAT
Anyway, onto my planned stages:
She'd do a watch
weird
Stage 3: I plan to begin speaking of how my friends are all turning pony, and say they keep bugging me to try it.
Stage 4: Show them a funny and/awesome PMV or song
;_;
Stage 5: ????
I kinda agreed with my friends that I won't bring it up arbitrarily so long as neither of them insult me/my friends/bronies directly or indirectly
Stage 6: Profit!
Stage 7: 400 babies
.....
ADVENTURE!
OH GOSH

That is why you don't fuck with Doctor.
Sumica Well they DID say FORRREEEEEEVEEEERRRRR.
what did they do to deserve eternal imprisonment?
Especially when he gives you a chance.
He is the highest authority in the entire of the multiverse
that and he'll give you a prostate exam,
They tried to eat him, more or less.
locke: Oh, only try to kill him and cause death and destruction across the whol universe while living forever.

They also forced him to become the doctor again

Sounds like ghostbuster's music
Big adventure
Tons of fun
beautiful girls

Faithful and strong
Sharing TARDIS
Sharing answers
(first)

(fine)
DUCK NOW
derp
Oh God.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
You have MY LITTLE TIME LORD
Awesome
If I ever saw one of those angel actors in real life.
I would die.
I thought it was DoctAH
dawww
shes cute
That would be an awesome thing to do in Central park as a living statue
It is the doctah
Whatcha watching?
Who?
... welp, I know what I'm doing for April Fool's Day next year.
so, what did I miss?
WhatPayne|mobile: BLINK
we watching BLINK, whatpayne
Painting myself to look like a statue and standing stock still in a park.
>mfw it is 4AM and I gotta sleep
No sleep.
so get this we have a guy at work that dresses up as a statue. He makes like 2grand a weekend from the tourist.
Why so serious?
It's Blink.
Ted Dekker's Blink was pretty good.
You could sleep, sugarcube, but then you'd miss The Doctor.
dari, I already saw it with ya
But Blink.
:P
stupid ringtone
I'M pretty sure I can skip this one, just this one
2 grand?
stupid stupid ringtone
neat!
I'm gonna fall asleep on my keyboard otherwise.
In the kitchen. Good place for her.
>One in the morning.
>It's 12:50 AM where I live.
Hm. I dont think I've heard of Blink
yeah they have to put security around him so people dont try to rob em.
also, ain't got much Timelord thinking processes I gotta follow.
DuskShine; PST?
Eeyup.
Yay, I'm not the only one here. :D
West coast is best coast
GOOD MORNING/NIGHT/WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
HAHAHAH
OREGON WOO
I am pst but not coast
I prefer Wisconsin, but the Mojave's not that bad.
whats happening
why are they in here
Oregon desert
:D
DARI, SEEING THE THREE-PARTER IS COMING, WAIT 'TIL NEXT TIME TO STREAM IT?
I have no idea why I love saying Mojave.
Spooky!
I gotta wonder...
its closer becuase your close to it then you were yesterday
still say theese things have a silly way of dealing with people.
If they were to reference Doctor Who in Friendship is Magic with a background gag, what would be the best way to do it?
All the burglars ring the doorbell now days, don't you know?
I would say a pony with an hourglass and funny hair.
Sonic screwdriver.
:P
I keep coming back to this idea, wherein they have a scene take place in the same area twice.
In the first scene, the blue box can be seen in the background, and Whooves runs into it in a panic.
holy crap!!!
Sumica and a british accent if he has any lines
that statue is all
In the second scene, the blue box is conspicuously absent.
HOLY SHIT
double facepalm
THAT WAS FUCKING CREEPY
OMFG
HOLY

WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF
ITS 3 AM HERE AND THATS FUCKING CREEPY
SCREams

Cow Quest
Cathyquest.
She entered the cow level
I meen they should send people to the moon, now that's a great place to get rid of some one for a few hundred years.
So all the angels do is take you back in time
that doesn't seem so bad
You'll see.
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME TO GO BACK IN TIME
It gets sad later.
:D
oops caps
oh shit

Not so much dead as dying after living a long, fulfilling life.
I love that, live to death
>lose all family, friends, end up out of place, in a time that you don't fit into
LIve to death
I love them
It's not exactly great anyway.
Better than just dying though.

Likewise, Sumica.

I agree
that's sad
ish
sumica, you are so random!
implying G4 is any good anymore with all the staff cuts
time travel the hard way
Thanks hunty
All G4 has is Cops
>.>

G4 ALL COPS ALL THE TIME!
*Headdesk*
I see what you did there
Depressing...
big pimp with a sweet style
gotta be old
You'd think if the Doc has this much foresight, he would never be surprised...
he has hindsight actually
How much foresight?
And then the angels consume his soul>?
I can see clearly now the rain is gone.
he is looking into the future behind him
Why do you think he has great foresight?
fortytwo cakes of foresight. That's four tens!
ACTION MUSIC
Four tens and an extra two.
Sotha, your math is rusty.
If you mean because he set up all the easter eggs and everything, well.
Yeah lets go there!
oh god why would you go back there
You'll see.
*yawns* im bored
tha'ts a good idea
great place to meet up.

Well apparently enough to know exactly when, how, and how many times these people with relay the message.
these guys are noobs
DuskShine: What's the product of six and nine?
Denied_Existence: As I said, you'll see how he knows.

Six and Nine? Well, that depends on which base you're using.
The proper answer is, of course, 42.

Well, sleep's overrated anyways!
WTF
You'd better announce when you blink
This is so scary.
just wink
You could try blinking with one eye.
Saying G4 in here while not meaning FIM can be confusing
You'd probably screw up eventually, though.
He is Sooooooooo dead

There are more angel episodes with Matt Smith later, but they completely ruined the angels.
At least until some idiot moves them.
Introduced a billion plot holes and ruined what makes them scary.
oh the angels in your head one/
That's sad.
Well, I'm never going to see those angel statues in public the same way ever again :D
what happened to the neckbeard
Just wait till the end of this episode.

sorry, was trying to time it before you posted
and I'm feeling GREEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAT!
screwed that up royally
Same here, btw
I'm now drinking a double gulp of Coca-Cola to energize myself
hehehe
1/3 of a 64oz pepsi bottle.
Cause you can never be high enough on pepsi.
HAHAHAHA
or Coke
pepsi tastes sugarier...
That reminds me, when one of my shih tzus was a puppy, we gave her some Coke and she stumbled around as if she were drunk
that stuff is strong to a dog
Do you like DBZ, Dermathil?
Grease on earth and pigswill to all men.
Hi Daru
Dari*
Dragon Ball Z? Nah not really
A very close fringe of mine once went carol slinging with the local pier.
ah. What about you, Dari?
Hey Barry.
Yeah, my sister and I used to watch it when we were younger.
Do you get Nicktoons?
Dunno, probably.
It's a cable channel.
not to be confused with Nickelodeon
A horse, a house, my kingdom for a hearse.
Lawl. XD
anyway, all this month on Nicktoons, they're airing a different DBZ movie. One on Wednesday, and another on Thusday
This week, they're airing Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan, and Fusion Reborn
Oh, for all those who claimed the 17 of September is a Monday, it's not
It is a Saturday
You know, I was wondering, in the Pokemon games, there are Flying-type pokemon that are depicted to only fly when they have to, yet even in the console games, Ground-type attacks don't kit them. You'd think, especially with Battle revolution, they'd add an animation of those pokemon taking to the sky to avoid the attack
Unless gravity was in effect
Furthermore, Battle revolution does another derp, if Gravity was in gen 4, I think. I never tried this, but I think in BR, the flying types that stay in the air, like Crobat, stay in the air even after Gravity was used
You'd think they'd have those Pokemon fight with their feet/talons/etc on the ground
Until gravity ended
Hi I_G
we know it was a Saturday btw
hm
also, I'm wondering if they chose matt smith to do a boring doctor to make the companions seem more interesting than they are (and to make River Song VERY awesome in comparison)
Maybe
Dari, Gotta speak to you about something
Yes?
in the PMs. it is about Doctor Who
Ok.

Good morning!
/me has not even contemplated going to sleep yet.
i finally woke up before 2pm on a weekend
hehehehe
It helps that I have more caffeine in my system than I probably should have.
i know what you mean
i one had 3 5 hour energies within 12 hours of each other
Duskshine, I am currently using Pepsi as the equivalent of internal fuel
im using day old pizza
Only had 4 hours of sleep tonight. Feeling relatively normal
hehehehe
it actually tastes better than when it was fresh
Mmmm, old pizza.
its my favorite too
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktzC8dy1V4
hehehehe
These days any pizza we order is finished in about a half-hour.
Hi guys
best Doctor Who theme evar
sauceless with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon
I haven't had old pizza in forever.
I know the feeling
any pizza my family has, if any is left over, is usually finished the very next day
if that
well im an only child, and my mom doesnt like the type of pizza i get so :)
also, the tunnel of lights in the vid is what a Time Vortex should look like, and NOT a tunnel made of clouds.
I'm on a family of four, and my the only pizzas My grandma will eat are alfredo pizzas and mac 'n' cheese pizza
in*
I was replacing on with in
i get to live in the basement :)
and no im only 16
dun' worry
I don't have a basement
yer not the only of that age around
I lived in a basement once.
It really wasn't that bad.
well
I wonder who the oldest person online at the current time is? I'm 22
Lots of free space to put things in.
its more of a bunker i built than a basement
23.
16
I do wonder...
16 going on 17 in about a week or two
yeah, a single week
Awesome.
of the ones who replied, Duskshine is the oldest
im turing 16 in November
errr 17 in November
Dari?
Mind reminding us all yer age?
I'm turning 23 on the first Wednesday of October

Two or four, I think.
The Euro show starts at 2 PM EST, 7 PM GMT
Two hours 'til preshow

(dat typo)
I'll stick around here for a bit then
about how long is the dark knight?
AH, and I'm feeling sweating. TIME TO OPEN A FEW WINDOWS!!!
DecapKing: between 2½ and 3 hours
and show starts at around 2pm EST?
yeah, DecapKing.
Can't remember.
it ALWAYS starts at LEAST on time
Darnit, Thanks anyways dari
>always
>DCD - shoe on head
:P
well im just going to skip the movies and just show up for the lottery
especially The Re-Animator
that movie was FUCKED UP!
Isn't the Re-Animator after the lottery?
How long until lottery
yeah
And yeah, that movie was... yeah...
The Reanimator was so funny.
/me admittedly did not even try to watch once he realized how much it would gross him out.
Just listened to it instead.
MY FACE WHEN, WINSTON CHURCHILL OUT OF ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE
Every film needs decapitated head zombie rape.
i only stopped watching after that reverse necrophilia rape scene
OH, dari, wasn't shoe on head for the Friday show, not the Euroshow?
Probably.
yeah
I know someone just asked it...
I meant the Euroshow is always on time
not that the Amerikashow ever it
*is
(it does have technical problems once every other week)
nah
Did that on purpose
ah
just dont miss spell Russia or Serbia
cause then you dont know how to spell
Russkia and Assertia? (jk jk)
xD
/me is really going bonkers
indeed you are my good sir
Y'know, there's one thing I don't like about TF2.
DARI, what week is this?
And that's no sprays on Valve's public servers.
spy?
which BMN week to be exact?
16 i think
AH, thank you DecapKing.
it says on EQD in one of the posts
The fact that this is my 15th week in a row in the BronyMovieNight chat may have an impact on my mental status.
Well that and almost-marathoning Doctor Who At This Very Moment
this is only my second week, but i spent nearly all last week in chat
I noticed
I spent the last 15 weeks, all the time in chat
yeah, it does eat at your brains
Pegacorn was affected pretty quickly
I wonder what that speaks 'bout him
AH, megavideo tiem.
every time while im in chat while there isn't a stream up i end up listening to metal
hehehe

Up to now, Matt Smith has shown to be very, very thick. I'd put him on par with Donna Noble

Q_Q
FUUUUUUUUUUU ANON!
sooooooooo
AH, so this is an episode that ISN'T written by the new main author
I HAVE RETURNED
/me plays "Stand Up" by The Prodigy as he enters the chatroom
So,anything happened while i was gone?
we decided to kill you off
WHAT?
eeeeeeeyup
AIN'T THAT A LOAD O' SHEET!
eeeeenope
eeeeeeeeeeeeyup
They did, I saw them discuss it
NOPONY CAN KILL THE LEADER OF THE HIGH ONES OFF!
well
(The 3th Birthday joke BTW)
we chose to leave you tied up at PrincessMolestia's house
so
have fun
But wait....she isn't here yet.
eeeeenope
she's just out
They said BMN made mush of your brain
but she'll be back soon
LIES WHATPAYNE
no its probally true
Not my opinion
MY BRAIN WAS ALWAYS MUSH.
and yelling
Ah. I see
Actually,i just randomly quote stuff.I was always like this ever since i first played a video game.
oh
so anyway we are going to leave you tied up at Molestia's house
Ok.
or ill just shoot you with my crossbow
:D
I'll just stay here.
or i can let Pinkiemania 'play' with you
Waddaya mean?
i believe you can put 2 and 2 together
?
eh, ill just leave you at Molestia's
PLEASE NO
as a zombie i cant carry something as heavy as you all that much
You're a zombie?
btw if you didnt know
im a sane zombie that fights injustice with a machete
You're cool.
also that idea is already trademarked for some type of graphic novel/anime
orly
not really
im just an earth pony
Ok.
I don't want to stay here!Somepony get me out please!
dont worry
it probably isnt as bad as they say it is
or maybe it is
IDK
DAMNIT
hey robotpinkie
ohai DecapKing
Ohai RobotPinkie
hey MeteorVenture
heya:D
well im in the middle of leaving Pegacorn at Molestia's house for thinking that he's better than everypony else for being an allicorn
Hi Metwor
Meteor*
also im kind of bored
I'M DOOMED
hey Pegacorn
do all allicorns whine this much?
argh.. all this talk of corn is making me even more hungry
all right then......
nah
thats bitching
(lol John Cena)
pegacorn is just 1 letter away from MEGACORN
so its corn that is mega?
indeed
heya pinkie
lol well that's fine.. my internet was all screwed up yesterday
I don't get where people get "alicorn" from.
i didn't realize how long it had been since i could use downloading and bytes in the same sentence
i think its cause they are everything?
well im bored
haha time for earthbound
for what?
Godddamn that server was bad...
I'M STUCK
earthbound sounds like a good plan
Morning everyone
Earthbound? Awesome.
Mornin', AllisZero.
morning AllisZero
i'm playing some earthbound zero
How's everyone doing
that game with ness in it.. i'm doing fine:D
I'm irritated thanks to a crappy public server in TF2.
/me is still chained to a wall
My troubles -started- with the entire team I was one constantly crying for a medic while nobody even thought to switch to one, and only escalated from there.
you're welcome DuskShine
Why do you always chain yourself to the wall, Pegacorn?
Nope.DecapKing chained me this time...i think.
... why is Pegacorn chained to a wall?
cause i got bored
also then i could steal all of his stuff
makes sense
RANDOM EPIC TRAILER TO PASS THE TIME:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH9bRfxBYCM
I remember the last time I got bored.
I decided to be DuskShine.
Crysis 2 was aweosme
I just wish it wasn't so short
It seems awesome.
It is, I preordered it
ALMOST got the Nano edition with a statue of Prophet
But $150 for a game? Nah
Seems to me FPS games are getting shorter and shorter in general
And just that the trailer has Invaders must Die in it totally screams AWESOME to me.
to make room for giant multiplayer that no one will use in 6 months...
Pretty much RP
I have to admit that you're right RobotPinkie.
But just look at MW2.People still play it to this day!
Well, but it's CoD.
Orite
People will play it till the end of time.
Well, yeah, and same with Halo and Killzone, people will keep playing those online
True dat
Other franchises like, say, Crysis, are much more prone to being a fad on the multiplayer side
But like... Bioshock 2 online multiplayer, was that really necessary?
What about DNF?Does anyone even play that game's multiplayer?
Though honestly the Crysis 2 multiplayer was awesome as balls, at least in the demo
Singularity?
i hope BF3 multiplayer is as good as BF2
Me too Decap, BF is probably one of the only games I'll play multiplayer and enjoy it
not a huge fan of BF, I have to admit
Me neither.
But i do like BFH.
haven't tried it, unfortunately
I enjoyed BF BC 2 quite a bit
i find it to be better than CoD multiplayer
Didn't play the first one but should
It's free.Except for ALL THE FREAKIN' ITEMS IN THE STORE.
i didnt like BFH
it wasnt truly free
Why is winter wrap-up so catchy, holy crap
I'd rather pay a one time price for a game, really...
it just is Zero
Why is there so much good pony fan music, though?
i like the metal covers that fans made
Indeed
Like I said, FiM is the West's Touhou
I dun geddit AllisZero
idk what Touhou is
Touhou is a series of japanese indie games that goes back to the 90's
I think it's a game series full of lolli's.
But the community around those games and the characters is immense
i love anime and all.. but i still like FiM a ton more than touhou
I'm not into Touhou at all
im not into bullet hell shooters
i like it.. the music is GREAT if nothing else
Me neither, though I can see why people are
When i put TouHou chars in MUGEN,my god the AI kicks my ass all the way to Kingdom Come!
But if you compare the amount of fan-driven content Touhou has and the amount of fan-made content FiM has, I think it's the only worthy comparison
In a smaller scale probably, but we're getting there :p
well they had so much more time
Yup
BUNKER
FiM sounds better IMO
ohay RainBroDash
HAI RBD!
/me creates a bunker and then runs into it.
I don't waaaaant to buy a carrrrrr
10ohai:3
but then again they even had a fanmade anime of sorts.. i think it only had 1 episode though and idk about the overall quality.. but apparently it had some higher up voice actors on it
Especially not an old Van.
It was awesome quality, I watched it.
i still have yet to watch it
Rie Tanaka was in it, so you can bet it was good
/me secretly sets up C4 charges around Pegacorn's bunker
C4!
/me gets rid of the C4
Damn, he's psychic too
Nah,i just used my magic.
...not sure I follow you, Pinkie_Pie
/me sends Pegacorn to a very 'special' place
PLEASE GOD NO
NOT THAT
well have fun Pegacorn
Wait
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tara Strong doesn't sing for Twilight?
Tara Strong is fucking amazing
Tara Strong should sing for Twilight.
Tara Strong is BAWS
wat?
I'm sure she'd love to hear her own voice actress sing.
Yeah I just think it's odd
/me is too tired to think straight anymore.
I'm confused....
yes you are
must not make gay thought pun
Hello confused.
"sing for twilight" in what sense?
WHY GOD WHY?WHY IS DECAPKING HELLBENT ON MAKING MY LIFE A LIVING HELL?
cause im insane
and bored
just noticed
NEED SOME HELP HERE!
well.. actually i still don't see it
IM GUESSING NO!
ohhh ok
i'm just sitting here playing earthbound zero.. not entirely watching the chat
/me has set a C4 charge on DecapKing's back
ENJOY BEING DEAD DECAPKING!
/me detonates the C4
what makes oyu think i wasnt already dead?
Dunno
fuu
well i was
I'm gonna go to sleep. Wake me up when the stream starts.

@awesomemeter 7-passenger minivan
6 7-passenger minivan is 89% awesome. (1620)

There we go
Numbers don't lie
If it were for me I'd probably bite the bullet and buy an Evo 9 or something similar.
I have no clue about cars

Ohai DSN
too much pony last night
bet I'm feeling better than most of my floor though :P
"Too much pony"? :O
and morning DSNesmith... or g'day maybe?
good afternoon more like
so I dunno if I wanna sit through dark knight again
when do we start?
I know, I should buy a Nissan GTR
And have absolutely no money for anything else for the next six years
Yeah I'd rather sit through Batman Begins twice in one weekend :P

I guess most people would disagree with me, but eh, I think Batman Begins is a better movie.
I only watched Batman Begins once when it came out
I think BB holds up better to repeat viewing
10last night was the first time I'd watched dark knight
10I liked it, but not ecstatic to see it again :P
wow, had you watched Batman Begins already though?
10I think so, a while ago?
10idk, not much of big movie person really
lately i've pretty much only watched movies on BMN...
I rewatched Iron Man 1 and 2 a few weeks ago
Just because Iron Man is my favorite superhero by a mile

@ponymeter RobotPinkie's spare time
6 RobotPinkie's spare time is 65% pony. (1622)
And I went to the teather to see Dark of the Moon too
Now I thought that was a great movie. Sucks I went for the 3D version though
Not sure what that movie is...
ohhh wait, new transformers?
yeah
Looking forward to seeing that, actually
Not a big fan of 3D though, don't really see what it adds
^
except eye strain
10it doesn't strain my eyes
10I'm not fussed about it, but yeah. it's ok
Doesn't strain my eyes, but it doesn't do anything for me.
I hate the live action Transformers movies.
I dunno, it strains my eyes when they have a lot of things that pop out too far from the screen
Eh, I like the live action Transformers movies
Well actually,i haven't seen 1 and 3,but i saw 2,and it was the worst movie i ever saw.
First one is pretty good, at least

DAMNIT,STILL DOESN'T WORK
Eh?
It does work, Pegacorn...
Not for me.
The problem with 3D imo is that
We just had the change to High definition cameras not many years ago
And 3D makes everything blurry as balls
True
THEY ARE INERT
Well, I don't get how 3D is all that spectacular before we have something like 100fps on HD video...
It's not spectacular in any way really
I mean for games 3D is pretty nice at 60fps
Why are they wasting time developing 3D technology, get working on our holograms God dammit.

I guess it's time to go play Twilight Princess huh

Dear Princess Midna....
I need some help guys!I'm chained yet again to a wall!
dont help Pegacorn

hello bronies
BY THE POWER OF LEVERAGE,I SUMMON THE CREEPER!
Ohai Ziltoid
2,14 hello ziltois
Oh dear
2,14ziltoid* even
Am I a creeper?
Nope
hi val and pegacorn
Anyone know who is streaming today?
My leverage power is decreasing!
2,14 not sure
And i know why!
I'm feeling GREAT, Valthejean. Just wondering if I'm starting to slowly go bonkers but yeah, Perfectly fine!
Gonna go upstairs to play some. Be back in a few hours guys.
hehehehahhaha
hahhahhahhahah
It's because i'm chained to a wall!That's why i can't use the power of leverage!
no it ain't.
orly
It is just because you were never meant to hold that much power
What!?
eeeeyup
You're a creature of the past
NO ONE PONY SHOULD HAVE ALL THAT POWER
But i was able to summon a Tank using the power of leverage!
That power was only lent to you
Now you gotta pay your taxes
Waddaya mean by "You're a creature of the past"?
@ziltoid are you talking about trixie?
nope
twilight has better magicks
Don't you see your lack of change? You keep coming back to your L4D and TF2 when there's so much more out there to create variety out of. Untapped variety.
lol i know
Variety and originality create power
twas a joke:P
the lack thereof only permits power to be bestowed temporarily.
/me throws a diamond pickaxe at Dermathil
BAM
NEVER DOUBT THE POWER OF THE HIGH ONES.
Oh, the high ones? You mean the mods?
where's your color then?
Nope.Just the ponies that trancend time.Those are the High Ones.
Ah, those High Ones. The ones who have lost themselves on the highways of the space-time continuum
They fight the Twisted,eventually they fall,then they wake up at the church on a snowy day,and the cycle repeats itself.
k now I'm full of caffeine and Dr Pepper, much better.
Oh, you mean you're the Twisted. Clever, could've been more implicit though.
I'm not the Twisted.
Who is it then, if not you?
Spoiler:Aya Brea's soul was shattered,creating the Twisted.
For you are the only one who knows of its existence. So either it is you or it is in your head.
(wuh?)
what game?
I mean I'm guessing 3rd birthday...
(The plot twist at the end of The 3th Birthday)
I gots no idea what that is, and its irrelevancy.
(ONE of the plot twists)
Well, don't spoil plot twists plz. Anyway, the only Parasite Eve that's a must play is the first one.
But it seems you are adapting, you are learning how to use variety for your own needs. Sounds great to me!
lmao I should learn how to convert zone times
...and that's only if you love that kind of game.
I'm just 2 hours too early
Eve dove into Aya's body to save her,but it shattered Aya's soul,scattering all over the world,creating the Twisted.
I was a witness.
But what Eve then?
Which Eve? What Aya? Which Aya? Specifications, little youngsters! That's what's lacking!
By diving into Aya's body,Eve also created creatures with her memories:The High Ones.
PEGACRON
DESTROYER OF WORLDS
Details, details, those are the wrong kind of details. What I need is specific details!
THAT TITLE DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM
For there are higher ups that deserve it more than him.
PEGACORN! THE PERSON WHO IS CHAINED TO A WALL AT MOLESTIA'S HOUSE!
Eve is the first person to have her mitochondrial DNA "activated", the name is a reference to our most recent common female ancestor, who many biologists refer to as "Mitochondrial Eve"
^ This is true
/me ponypounces RobotPinkie

is the broadcast working for anyone else or is it just dead

Rather, Descendent of Blueblood. Now THAT is 100% accurate.
While keeping your other statement true
I don't know, Zephirdd, I think Pegacorn is talking about 3rd Birthday, which is the third "Parasite Eve" game.

Hmm
That's a lot of C4...

What would you guys say is an appropriate tag for our network?
General description of the network
A tag such as "Gaming", "Support", "Politics", ect.

NOOOOOOOOO!!!!
all of those
/me gets sent to hell
10dari.. god knows
10entertainment?
dari, add SCI-FI and DRAMA to the tags
2,14 our...network? I dunno....media? Entertainment?
10if that's applicable
11 Entertainment.
Ok.
Ponies, clearly. :P
this network. i believe it would be INSANITY/MEDIA
Yeah, that sounds good.
and PONIES
Not this network.

3I am Me.

/me goes and punches RainBroDash for no apparent reason other than pure boredom

9I am an enigma
Now I know who you are, BronzeHeart. The conglomerate of all the disconnected mods in an alternate IRC discussing what actions to take.
HAHAHAHA
It's clearly SilverScreen.
How many of you folks have actually seen re-animator?
:P
i have
I think the most interesting thing about the various shipping fics for MLP is that you don't have to derail characters to make any of the Mane Six pairings work.
wait didnt you chose it Ziltoid?
yeah
I have, Ziltoid... not just last night, but I have the limited edition DVD set :P
that would make sense, given his nature to rp :P
but I dunno
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
HEHEHEHAHAHAHAH
I feel like this is a much more complicated riddle
gtg guys,seeya all at 9PM.
with a result that will shock and horrify me
Just checking for people who havnt seen it before
I have not yet seen it.
Re-Animator is one of those movies that should be watched with the original Mono audio track...
I'm soo looking forward to a few of the more epic Doctor Who episodes and the day we will watch BOTH Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies on the 17th night of September.
Hey, just wondering if any IRCops are available to add a WebIRC entry for me.
2,14 there is no force on earth that can prepare you for it freezeframe
I was doing homework and take-home quiz during BMN last night.
ValtheJean: Isn't it a Lovecraft story?
Nope.
It's Silver.
Originally, yes
yes
2,14 based on, yes
you take the fun out of everything dari :P
Loosely based on "Herbert West: Re-Animator"
The fact that I am familiar with Lovecraft should do it.
Trololo
11You know not.
it has reverse necrophilia rape in it
Yeah I do.
>Logged hostnames.
2,14 no spoilers decap :P
7....
Y U SPOILERS
Holy crap.
7you...ffffucking suck.

Scheepers/Schiavone is an amazing match (US Open Tennis)
Bronzeheart is logged in as Silverscreen
Trololo
Sounds like a party.
you're still a killjoy :P
They just went to a tie break on the second set.
INDEED IT SOUNDS LIKE ONE!
xD
/me 0kicks DecapKing in the face with the foot of FRIENDSHIP!
Well the users in the chat still don't know.
Go mystify them. :P

best done via email staff@mibbit.com
2,14 lol for a moment there bronzeheart, you sounded like arktis
Hmm, the wiki indicated that it'd be easier over IRC, I'll send an email instead then.
I'm rooting for Scheepers because she's ranked 81st in the world, against the 7th ranked Schiavone.
so who is streaming today?
What channel is it on?
CBS
K thnx.
hi
5SirSprinkles usually streams saturdays but his job is keeping that from happening.
at the moment, we need to do it by email. this is temporary
5Wow, that's a horrid color.

why is the wuality so much worse than yesterday?
awww, Schiavone won :(
05hmm, disconnected :o
Why is everything suddenly white?
fluttershy is dusty?
NOOOO NOT WREK!
Dusting with you tail? What would Rarity say.
That voice
http://miburl.com/wLo5W8 My opinion on Season 2
Oh wait,I just realized I was zoomed in on Antarctica,never mind :p
Scootaloo has a voice that can break glass
Applejacks like "Fuck THAT noise.
Bai Applejack\
07Dark_Horst different streamer today
Best background music ever.
Pinkie's jam
Scootaloo has a voice that makes ears bleed
wait, Luna isnt streaming for once?
Scoots must be tone deaf
horses raising pigs?
LIVESTOCKCEPTION
07indeed
Isn't that like a seriously disability in Equestria?
not for food, Gummy
10Zephirdd dat TL.net thread
is it dari?
07I stream monday
Since everyone can apparently spontaneously sing and choreograph.
true
RainBroDash: post there and bump it pls :D
dat whining
anyone else having stream lag?
i wish i had a tattoo on my thigh
Well, the only ponies who haven't had solos are Rainbow, Twilight and Applejack
yup, laggin for me too
yeah, laggy
but we alligators don't have 'em
Applebloom is not Madame Cleo
Winter Wrap-up was mainly Twilight.
plot
We know they're good in a group, but what about when they're singing by themselves
Zephirdd = same here
with no other ponies
11inb4 that flank
10Zephirdd I just skipped to the last page and saw BronyState XD How many people from here post on that thread??
do something, look at your butt
Including me
I believe one
:D
Rarity had one, Fluttershy had one, Pinkie Pie had several
Enter Cheerilee
I actually didnt know about bronystate until yesterday's post at eqd
10:D
and I bet she'll have even more come Season 2 in two weeks
/me is listening to an awesome guitar solo, courtesy of John Petrucci
RaZor: Glasglow Kiss?
oh :P
actually, all of the Mane 6 have had solos, just not full songs. Twilight, Applejack,and Rainbow each had their own verse (on in Twi's case, 2) in WWU.
tiger taming
False-Name Drop!
/me can't be tamed.
NOOO!!! a self-referencing paradox!
All right fine, but they're usually one line
Rainbow had a couple
Twilight had a few
And then Rarity went out of business
6Well LA DEE FRIKKIN DA
lol^
6...where is everypony. -_-;
why does the bgm sound like porno music?
05im tryign to setup a stream :o
sweetie bell making sence?
because you watch too much prono, interior_gummy
because you have a dirty mind, gummy
05atleast configurign as muc has possibru
6You should be getting ready for the mod meeting that was SUPPOSED to happen.
that's why I avoid Classic COla
heyas everypony :D
hi zonra
Sweetie Shyness is adorable
hi zonra
gotta love scootaloo :D
>take martial arts
07i'm here
damn, a rocker chicken
07and ready
>thinks it's dancing
il just get in here watching with you as a draw a bit this evening
This is gonna be so wonderfully bad
0Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
yes.
10no.
Kung fu isn't like dancing. They're two completely different things and it takes true skill to meld the two perfectly
no, because ponies
maybe
6Too bad nopony else is. >>;
PARTY HARD
There's even a style that deals with that
6Ghosties... you there bro?
Scootaloo is cute when frustreaded
called Dancefighting
AND A T-SHIRT WAS MADE
dumb fabric
The meeting should wait until after the stream.
Applebloom would probably like Tai-Bo
0Your dacning is no match for my Kung Fu!
At least the main show.
are more people coming?
digestia....
0Maybe, Gummy.
11no
6You do realize that's after midnight for a good few of our mods, yes?
What is that, a new country where everyone is stomachs?
no, only 53 people are allowed
probably for dark knight
I'm suprised that the fandom hasn't done more Digestia jokes honestly
hmm...
yeah
I glad
I'm glad*
:|
0That's because it's nasty and terrfying
they'd be terrible
I'm here, but most likely will not be for much longer
Male ponies have five legs.
I was ambushed by two friends
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT A LEG?
0Dohoho
can only think of bad vore jokes, and il do without that
14I just got back.
Picturing it.... do not want do not want
True, it just seems like something that would've happened.
14Had to take an emergency bathroom break
Scootaloo with a strap on could wear that
0...
Still don't get the power tools joke
...
what?
...
/me 0is gonna go sit OVER THERE
clumsy fillies with power tool, think about it
surprise amputation?
riders the joke is that Sweetie Belle is in no mental condition to be operating power tools, as she would end up goring herself on a drill or something like it.
Applejack: Once again failing to be the element of honesty, *Tsk* *Tsk* Tsk*
3cant believe the was a good version of the song...

I'm here.
Snips and Snails' talents: being morons.
0sry
For my defense, I had no idea they were coming
0I really wonder how that poetry went
They showed up around noon
07i'm here too
shoulda said this earlier, but xchat-gnome sets snomasks by default on all servers
14So you say dumb fabric!
False name Drop!
6I know... still, we're missing half our mods.
title drop!
title drop 2.0
MORE PARADOXES!!!
0So what were you saying, anon?
Break a leg! I'll get the shotgun!
DUMB FABRIC!
Nittany_Tiger You have to give them props for trying though.
time for best song
/me doesn't even know how many mods we have now.
Yes.
6A lot more than we did.
FACE GROUND!
/me 0mutes
BREAK A LEG?
I THINK YOU MEAN HOOF
dammit sparkle, you said good luck
14Yeah..
yea, what ive been trying to tell him for 4 months...
6Last I checked was 13...
ziltoid this can't be best song, rarity isn't in it
14I got up early to be here lol
Totally need to buy that Dumb Fabric shirt when I have some spare cash
Impending Train Wreck!
So, I just hope you guys aren't upset at me
he'd rather blam mibbit
VioletVanilla, ponies have legs too
that would be break a foot
It would be a very bad idea for a pony to break a leg.
I will be truthful, this is not my favorite song at all.
6And I think we got a few more since.
lawl
well then use normal xchat not xchat gnome. xchat-gnome really isn't xchat itself i've used xchat on ubuntu and never had an issue
random pony trivia: Scootaloo's va had to really try to be terrible at singing.
6It's cool dude. I guess.
6Not your fault.
I know Zephirdd~ I was being Lauren Faust XD
:P
slide show :(
14Dat lag
but i really like this singing :D
im scared
This is glorious hair metal bad
6Yeah, we're at 13 mods now.
best song ever
dat solo
it's not really an 'issue', more like, toomuchinformation for some users
in a vocals only version of the song, you can hear coming up the VA crack up.
The dev team is interested in recording a correct version of this song at a later date, or so I heard
we are spinal tap?
love Scootaloo and her badass coolness :D
0This isn't metal enough. :\
Dat Luna
suddenly dancing luna
11Dat luna
Barry: source?
14So we're missing at least 5 then
LUNAAAAAAA
lol luna
PARTY HARD
suddenly, luna
Luna's loving this song.
LUNAAAAA!
ohai Luna
what the?
/me hugs Luna
0lol
6I don't think dari is here... >>;
07~yay~
Luna is where?
cue waw waw music
/me 0unmutes
Oh, hay there
hey! i thought it was awesome!
0AHAHAHAHA
Scootaloo goes back to her house, cobain's herself
was it batman?
14Not sure if Val is either.
/me hugs luna
three fillies do all this by themselves, I think it was freaking good
0Oh, that's harsh, Rawrity
4Like I told Sath, I'll read the chatlogs when I get back and give my input. Hell, I'll be on Skype so we can talk further in detail
/me hugs Luna~
6Val's lurking, I believe.
*Ahem* How sad, let me play you a song on the tiniest violin in the world.
razyn I have a very...dark sense of humor
so scootaloo marries a untallented mare that kills her and make it look like a suicide
The only ponies left.
> three awards
dark humor? i can do you one darker
> three presentation
s
Everyone's a winner.
6There were 4 presentations.
we all love Luna
4?
wat
6Yeah.
who did I miss
only people who lost were Diamond Tiara and Silver SPoon
/me hugs Luna
0What were they, Sirsprinkles?
6Didn't show the fourth, but DT and SS were on stage.
their presentation wasn't shown
oh
cool
>yfw S2E25-26 are a two-parter where the CMCs finally earn their cutie marks.
sucks to be them.
6I'd die, Freeze.
14Probably
6Like, die.
s2 has only 24 episodes D:
FreezeFrame I WILL EAT YOU
comedy
0 24 and 26 at the same time
Zephirdd: Nope, S2 has 26
RAWRity: also twist
/me waves
The show producers won't let the CMC get their cutie marks. Maybe get close.
i think they really should get their marks
Cutey mark stooges
That'd be pretty awesome. But I'd really like TV movie for that. QUEST OF THE CUTIE, or something like that.
24 that were made for S2, and the initial two-parter was originally for S1
they SHOULD get their marks
0Rawrity: This. Just this.
i'd both be amazed that they actually got their cutie marks because of what that would mean for the show and curious about what's gonna happen next
Only 24.
6ARE YOU READY?
/me 14waves back and RBD lol
oh ty FreezeFrame
6FOR THE DARK KNIGHT?
NOPE.AVI!
Apparently the S2 two-parter wsa supposed to be the S1 finale
14Eh, a lot of us are here anyway.
BATMAN
only if it has less lag
Fushigi!
DAt Cone
0Depends, what's the quality?
tim burton's batman?
0...
FreezeFrame I have an assault rifle here, and I DO NOT like spoilers.
Heath Ledger > everyone
they can still be their adorable selfs but with new goals
D_E: I haven't spoiled anything.
I can't spoil if I don't know.
0D_E not spoiler if it's meta imo.
FreezeFrame Still gonna eat you. GET IN MY BELLA
I really hope they do eventually get them, I hate when shows have something like that and Status Quo never changes. Plus, then hasbro could sell "special edition CMC, NOW WITH CUTIE MARKS!" AND MAKE MORE MONEY.
I wish my HDMI cable was long enough to reach my TV from here.
I know I read it somewhere, but I can't seem to find it
6We'll wait until after The Dark Knight to get started...
Put Dark Knight on the 32" set.
ya me too rawrity
6Maybe the others will show... =/
but i think they can hold out another season or so
yeah for laptop with hdmi
I'm streaming this from my PS3.
RAWRity: Agreed. If they don't get them in S2, it'd be... weird
07yea the B movie will go on mute... for me
no need to rush things.. but we do need to keep moving foward
Too bad I don't have a hi-def TV.
07that horrible movie
6Leg flail like a boss.
Came just in time :D (that's what she said, I know)
plus we could have an episode where the CMC start to drift apart now that they each know what their talent is. It'd make for a really nice episode IMO
0Rezo, what about the other seasons?
MLP doesn't stand and fall with the CMCs, you know
inb4 Wanna know how I got these scars?
just like twist and apple bloom did
yea, handeling their friendships after getting their marks would make a good episode
I know, but they are recurring characters, and I'd like to see them advance as characters too
6So yeah, after the lotto we'll get started.
I like it, too, but one can stretch it for too long. Good plots have CONCLUSIONS
6Should test...
6!nicks
0Maybe one at a time
I know nobody cares, but you won't here much chatting from me because I've been meaning to see this.
6Cool, it works.
S1 was more characterization, but S2 could definitely do more advancement from that point.
14Oh yeah... Re-Animator again, ew
6Or not.
HANDCANNON
0If one CMC get's her mark at a time, /that/ would be awesome.
14!nicks

I love ponies.

we all love ponies
Wow, me too, Zephirdd!
RobotPinkie = Of course it is. It's obvious that Black Dynamite rose from the grave 3 days later like Jesus to take the form we know and love

6There needs to be a Dark Knight with The Riddler
6The Riddler was an amazing villain.
2,14
Well that's G3 I think... he's asking you guys
The Riddler should appear more imo
2,14 ^*'
:(
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: this is the first film that features Batman working outside of Gotham
2,14 jeez I can't type today
yay trivia is back!! :D
You could type enough to say "right on shawnyall" :3
ZOMG PONY GAMES
DONT JUMP
2,14 it's because you're special ;)
14lol
I think the problem with the riddler is that it's dificult to take him seriously after the Jim Cary fiasco
I got the IRC sorted with the mibbit opers.
show off
14I luv me sum pony games
Everything will work now.
*Opens his EqD bookmark in a new tab.*
"New McDonalds Pony Flash Games"
Instant five-star rating, get.
>Implying it was ever possioble to take the riddler seriously
14Wewt
where you flash your ponies at people
jim cary was awesome ^^
could make the riddeler like creeepy serial killer style
Why so cantonese?
2,14 I actually liked Jim Carrey as the Riddler....
6Cools.
You mean you liked The Riddler as Jim Carrey
Dammit, internet must be derping again, stream's lagging for me.
This is something I never expected to do.
Watch a Batman movie with bronies.
I think chinese joker would cut people's eyes.
I liked Batman & Robin, it was very much a tribute to the cheesy old Batman show more than anything else.
Batman & Robin was amazing.
Chinese Joker would still be communist
Shawnyall: what, did you think bronies weren't manly enough to watch batman or something? :D
2,14 lol, inb4 kicks
He has been bat napped!
No, just never thought I would do it. :P
batman and robin was just horrible
nothing else
Batman and Robin WAS fun. Not serious, but fun
!nick*
it was boring
Kicks, ValtheJean?
Then again, I watched a horror movie with furries.
it was silly but okay
Anything can happen.
Batman & Robin wasn't as bad as everyone says it is, but I still liked the other movies better
lol
6!nicks
6It works.
robotpinkie that it might have been, but as a follow up to "Batman Returns" it was jut a really drop in quality
11Jim Carrey made a great riddler. Tommy Lee Jones didn't do that bad as the Two Face he was given to work with. Schwarzzenager was a victim of shitty writting. Don't blame the actors for bad scripts.
lol well good thing it was the follow up to Batman Forever, then :P
Batman Returns is probably my favorite Batman movie, though.
Batman is always right
2,14 Nono, Schwarzzenager was not a good actor in that movie, I don't care about the writing. He is not Mr. Freeze
Schwarzzager is one hell of an actor, but the movies are so bad :P
it's still a sequel to it, as it's in continuity
damn
I do like the first two 'Modern' Batmans a lot. Although the first one features a mildly ridiculous plot.
11HeavyMetalPony: How did his dialog go again?
I cant spell that name for shit

Some men just want to watch the world burn.
Spike would kill that guy
Some men just want to watch ponies.
"some men just do it for the lulz"
<3
Man, I'd love a tangerine the size of that ruby right about now...
AND WE HAVE YET ANOTHER MEME
Meanwhile, did you see that comic?
I'm fine with either
11Some worlds just want to watch men burn
I actually did not.
6In here.
Some ponies just want to watch the world burn
14Boring lol
6Since a chat program will eat my computer.
They made a comic out of that scene.
Where was Gondor when some men just wanted to watch ponies?
Joker is Lulzsec (or found it).

This is more like Se7en than anything in Batman Begins
2,14 inb4 we figure out dari's just trolling us for teh lulz
05already have a server up and running

05but meh

Apply logic to trolling, and you get that.
10Well the thing is
MAGIC
10we can't have a chat without all of us in it really can we
This still more scientific than Deadliest Warrior
oh science, is there nothing that you can not do?
14I dont see why not.
>_<
and nore than csi
lol
Get a woman
Deadliest Warrior : "IT SLICES THROUGH HIM TROLOLO SCIENCE"
10well if we're having a meeting-style discussion
lol
10we can do it for casual stuff
not the mare
14We would be here anyway RBD.
Science can reanimate.
RAWRity = Damn straight!
I will not watch that film again, ever.
10yeah but the people who aren't wouldn't hear anything would they
Mayor Mare is in danger!
14The difference is voice over typing.
Batman would win every episode of Deadliest Warrior.
6Not all of us have voice.
Batman would win most things.
except for him against Pinkie PIe
10are you going to be typing out every single sentence you say while you say it? :P
6Which is why we're ruling it out for the moment.
14Anyone here who doesnt have a mic?
Pinkamina > All
Deadliest warrior, Batman vs Chuck Norris!
10yeah sprinkles can't voice chat atm
meanwhile technically it can. they reanimated a Dog's severed head in the 40's in the soviet union
pinkamena vs deadpool?
6I can
Batman
6Just not during streaming.
lawl, nah we can let the viewers hear our conversation
in both
NOTHING bad could happen :P
10atm*, as in during streaming
No one disproved my claim that science cannot get a woman
Chuck Norris will win within -2 minutes, then have sex wiht your mom
batman vs batman
6Also, Silver's mic sounds like a robot.
Batman kicks his ass while he's sucking dick.
14We could do it after the stream. Unless someone has to go after.
6Completely unable to hear it.
A fact i'm well aware of RAWRity, but technically it was moving a live head into a state where it should be dead but wasn't, thanks to the wonders of tubes.
derpybrony Pinkiepool
6It'll be quite late aterwards.
10yeah but he'll be able to hear us, and then respond by typing
Robin x Jimmy Olsen
:O that needs to happen
10I agree I won't really want to wait till afterwards
pinkiepool that is
inc boom
>inb4 Bruce gets the blame.
A Telescope! KILL IT!
there are pinkiepool comics
Batman wins by virtue of always carrying a rock of Kryptonite

Mommy, why is Batman there?
Blame hero for actions of villains.
Sad Batman is Sad

i think i once saw a pinkiepool custom toy
Dark_Horst keep watching.
lol
Dark_horst no, he just went to play Sirius Black and die again.
10lolololowned
we can discuss that later, but since we're on a time crunch I say we discuss however works for everyone
This is why I don't invite Batman to parties anymore
Batrave
lol
6'Tis why we have Skype. And it's one of the thing we'll be discussing during the meeting.
Batman goes to the Batrave, I love it
Batman is an angry drunk/
BATRAVE IN THE BATCAVE
pff this party is boring
we can organize weekly meetings and whatnot later, but for now it's best to do what works
someone needs to call Pinkie Pie
Commish'nah Gordon Freeman kills zombie-jokers all night long.
Where are you? where are YOU?
6We're doing it here.
14Last time we tried a conference call with Skype, it was an utter distaer.

Coin was double-headed in the first place
Batman's
But twoface scratched a side out to make tails
He didn't scratch it, it got burnt
Ah right
how it got burned ?
Same way he did
Confused there for a second
Oil and fire.
watch the movie
and youll get it
He scratches it out in the comics
was more a quote than a question
In the comics, he scratched it up after he got acid thrown in his face.
I wonder of those Bat Stars are effective in real life
I thought the point of batman was to be bill gates with muscles.
Anyway,back to facts about ther moon
07lurkers gonna lurk

DAT IRONY!
Apparently,the moon was formed when a mars sized planet named Theia collided with the earth (Damn women drivers :p) Kicking up 2 large clumps of rock and dust.These collided again with each other to form a big cloud of gas,rocks and dust which eventually became the moon.
You know, it can't actually be that hard to track down Batman. He's a hightech suit, a shiny car, he's got to have a sizable support base. Bruce should be at the top of the list, anyway
SUCK IT DARI!
LOL DecapKing, NINJA'D

You shall not kill Batman
but Apple is hated. There should be a decent number of Mac viruses.

How much ammo does he have?
2,14 I wouldn't go that far dashite. They're both very different interpretations of the joker

oh hey, gordi
Gordon will live!
I SWEAR, I THOUGHT HE WAS GORDON FREEMAN.
OH SHIT!
and then harvey fcks up, yes?
lol, Gordi was person 99% of people in theatre thought was evil
Hammill's is meant to be dark, but still safe for younger audiences. Ledger is meant to be completely balls out crazy
lol
So many knives.
Potato peeler
Why so knifey? :3
incoming improvisation
knives and lint, knives and lint
Those are some big pockets
Well the good thing about that I doubt there are many people who use mac and want to unleash a virus on the system they are so proud of due to lack of them
thats why Ledger is so awesome RAWRity
Joker likes to be on the cutting edge of things

shawnyall he got em, too
You get a good night or admission that the pun was good. Choose! :p
INB4 WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU PEOPLE
Dat peer
What's involved in the "good night," Dashite?
Dang Spies
Shawnyall is good.
this bit
Batman is a certified interrogation machine.
Suddenly, Batman!
:P
SUDDENLY BATMAN
RobotPinkie I say "Good night RobotPinkie!" when you leave. :p
looks like I am behind
14Mmmmm I smell bacon
Gotcha!
Batman routine
14And that wasnt a cop joke :P
Ooh.
Well what if you leave before me, Dashite? :(
Just worked out what I'd choose for my A movie.
INB4 GORDON IS A COFFEE CUP
it's a testament to how good this film is that i can jump in at about halfway through
05<3 pink floyd
RobotPinkie, I never leave...
and still love it
Bonk
I admit it was a bad joke, though...
NEVER START WITH THE HEAD!
Dashite Are you sure that was what you meant? Don't make me ship you against your will!
Dari's dying for Babar the Movie :P
good cop, BATMAN routine
Wut?
But just because it was bad doesn't mean it wasn't funny, Dashite!
lol
He just wants to love and tolerate the s*** out of Batman
I watched it yesterday,I'm just waiting and spouting moon facts,speaking of which
Denied_Existence, wut? I have no idea what you are talking about. :/

RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Batman and Joker never reference themselves by their name on this scene
RobotPinkie, fair enough. :p
The Italian Job (Original)
I love that film.
Uh-huh, suuuuuuuuurrrrreeeee
ah
Like a leper
So... I guess I'll settle for the "good night," Dashite :P
that's not a bad choice
It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun, although its surface is actually very dark, with a similar reflectance to coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have since ancient times made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art and mythology.
I'm serious, I really have no idea WTF you mean Denied. :/
Zephirdd, it's called good acting. <3
I am a writer Dashite, and a skilled one at that
6That... is an amazing movie.
Shawnyall: lol, I didnt want to mean it that way :P
Just ask the furry erotica author who paid me to write shit *Shiver*
But what prompted the threat? O.o
lol I know.
I'm pretty sure we also decided the legth of a month using the moon,not sure about that
Random trivia was random and I enjoyed it.

Hmm, is Watership Down A or B?
ReticentSmolder x RainBroDash
half his face had been burned, but we don't need to have anybody there keeping an eye on him,
nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
A?
never heard of it, I'll look it up
It's a children's film.
Harvey Dent. You are now Darth Vader.
Flip it over, what do you get?
until joker blows it all up anyway
Probably the most bloody/messy children's film in existence. :D
BURNED FACE
darn
Batman touched this coin, I will never wash it.
TWO FACES
ONE BURNED
someone made the page editable
ONE NORMAL
If this had been real,two faces exposed eye would have become infected and he would have died in 2 days
WAT DO
well, I don't think that after the care for the burn they'd need to watch him recover
10emmettbrown wouldn't he also probably be in a shitload of pain?
"They called you...Harvey Two Chin"
I think it's A.
LOL
yep
he was rainbro hence the silent screaming
lol, rawrity
Why does his chin look like balls?
RainBroDash, hurray for lethal amounts of morphine!
Manly chin
I'm kind of inclined to go with B
RAWRity: lolling forever
10but scatr he runs around like it's nothing for the rest of the film
Rawrity PM
They don't look much like balls anymore
10with open gashes all over his face
SEGA
true
Harvey Two Face.
:3
RainBroDash, adrenaline. Official explanation. :p
05would masters of the universe count as B?
10fair enough dashite :P
0We're only halfway through, aren't we?
I dunno, I'd say A because it has a high rating.
I want a mountain of money
holy mother of unintentional comedy
DUN DUN DUUUUN
holla holla get dolla
adrenaline: it's like a wizard, in a way
ohhhh this is what the banker's for
Unless one of the balls are supposed to look burnt
dat reveal
It's an old film so budget isn't going to be massive.
I'd say 70@, Razyn
Razyn, nah, we're more than half way
70%
sooooooooooo pwetty
wrek: yeah that's B
Now the hell can he talk properly, Dashite? :P
Not even watching :p
lolboat
05though its horrible
Harvey Dent becomes two face? This comes out of nowhere
I want the official explanation for how he can say the letter M!
05hmm
lol
and I dunno Dari, I think it could go either way
Sliding down money.
He's not even wearing that much make up
I always wondered how much it would hurt to drink whiskey through a burn wounded mouth
Only fucking Heath Ledger.
RobotPinkie, lots of practice.
Most of it is CGI
Watership Down is a pretty awesome film though.
0Is this pile his half?
movie's 2:32m long -- what time did we start?
14Oooh, Watership Down
05mhm
because joker just won't give a fuck
We've got another 30 minutes or so.
whole thing started at 7
Don't worry, our government does the same thing with its money

07and the songs touch my heart everytime
Money fire!
aaaand we've come full circle

Water doesn't burn, Joker. Your premise is flawed.
You missed out if Watership Down wasn't one of your childhood films Val. :P
I've found that watching this in 5:4 is better than 4:3
Lambo
I probably did
07I want Rocky Horror picture show as B or labyrinth :P
fun thing is, as soon as the fires outside go out, there's stillg onna be plenty usable notes INSIDE of the mountain
Does if you electrify it
but I wouldn't know
actually, a hot enough fire can split it into 2 parts Hydrogen, 1 part Oxygen
dat lamborghini
Then the Hydrogen will burn.
lambo > batmobile
actually
stream crashed for anyone else?
But then it's no longer water...
batcycle > lambo > batmobile
14Rocky Horror Picture Show, oh no XD
doesn't burning technically require carbon?
Does if you electrify itplus top gear accidentally set a working car wash on fire
07Hell yes :D
no
07or grease :D
"Burning" is simply a heated oxygenation of material
Haha, grease.
ohhhhhhhh I used to watch Labyrinth all the time
XD
scatr: all>Bat Credit Card
If you break the H2O bond, then how's that water? :P
14Grease is... alright. I'd rather watch Rocky Horror myself :P

10roughly 2 arms
Seeing your name made me think about working on my 8-bit Octavia.
5 minutes is too long

his outfits bulletproof
looks like batman just kicked chance in the nuts
>He fell off the larger building and landed on a car with a girl on top of him, and it didn't hurt him at all.
Hes Batman, he can handle a 5 Story fall and live
i can't believe twoface didn't see that :/
>Batman is a good actor.

The idea behind the growl is to play up his persona as a demon
lol

I don't get this whole "hero it deserves, but not the one it needs" bullshit.
