Vordox, yes strong emotion
especially in The Moon Rises
CrimsonPhoenix: here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc-YMUWvA1s
When... the morning comes.

CrimsonPhoenix: Sorry flash derped

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85WftgmZ9FY

/me knocks on the door, "Telegram."
Whoa deja vu

Goodnight alexxm :)
http://youtu.be/kPjVCIX5Fvs This one......it's starts so calm and then you just.....you can just feel her jealousy growing
if you don't mind the rather masculine voice
I think it's the drum in the background after the middle that just gets me more
yeah that must be it
CrimsonPhoenix: You haven't heard, nor liked, the video I just posted?
I believe I did
I love the original better though
CrimsonPhoenix: You know what...
technoy remix is heh with me
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-3wp2VVhKQ
that's no based on ponies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-4ppU5FMQI
omg who remembers this from our resint movie nite http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJqe9Jxeb0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKlsUrfbiE0
CrimsonPhoenix: I know but it's related now after that video :p

still very good
Hmm...
Based on MLP that's sad...
Or emotionful..
OH!
Vordox, you don't get it
I'm not searching a music
and I don't mean side
I mean if it GIVE emotion
makes you feel
CrimsonPhoenix: I know
whether it's anything
<--- Music lover.
as long as it's strong
and seriously what is your goal
make me say OH SNAP THIS IS BETTER THAN MY TOP 3
??
CrimsonPhoenix: Yes
what's going on? did someone have an opinion again?
Stop that it's anoying
Hai guys, hur dur.
Woah woah woah woah children.
Lets watch Babes in Toyland./
I have my opinion and I say that ponyphonic is one of the best in terms of "Brony" music
What the hoo boy doggies is going on in here.
BlazeAngel: No. :D
And my + is gone again.
followed by Sand Josieph
OKAY. Who ate my +?
CrimsonPhoenix: And here I am, trying to find a song you haven't heard that you may give emotion to as well
>_>
<_< not me
Otherwise, you'll never...well...never change
I change as I explore myself
brony music? you mean sound clips mashed together, right?
thank you very much
CrimsonPhoenix: I know, but who said you'll only learn from yourself?
Warning.
Blazesplosion.
Would you like to play again?
Buytoast, I meant something like this http://youtu.be/H4tyvJJzSDk
Too bad.
but yeah you're right
*Dances around the screen*
most Brony song are lame and unimaginative
CrimsonPhoenix: What do you think of rawness? :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GASJsYs-VBk
rawness?
No big sync, no audio item
Just pure sing with mic and instrument being played?
Nothing in between a person and his music, just that alone.
I do preffer that over softwares stuff
CrimsonPhoenix: <3
I GOT BALLS OF copper.
and that's what ponyphonic is except the fact that he must combine his instrument together
I GOT BALLS A STEEL
Noooo... your balls have a stronger metal than mine...
Mine conduct electricity better...
DOCTOR, DISCHARGE
:p
CrimsonPhoenix: Wait woot?
ponyphonic use actual instruments
CrimsonPhoenix: I hear ALOT of software uses in PonyPhonic

PeachStreak: not right now - just talking about glitches I remember seeing - last played Skyrim in August
Another funny moment - in a bandit cave, just down the stairs were 2 bandits at a table - shot 1 with an arrow, didn't kill him but alerted a 3rd to a room to the right...
Deacon: Do you play Gmod? :|
i cant resist 3 days more i want th third season now
I do have Gmod, but I'm still not sure how to use it
Ah.
I sneak back up the stairs and watch as they walk back and forth, one faces the wall with back turned to me, I ready an arrow and fire it...
HEY
That was soooo delayed...
razorwing1269 it's been almost 200 days since season 2 finale, I sure you can wait three more days
just when a bandit runs out of the room on the right and into the path of my arrow - instant kill :D
Howdy y'all! I appoloigze for my abrupt leave.

buying hasbro is a natural progression for disney since hasbro already makes most of the Marvel and Star Wars toys you see on shelves
DeadpoolDash: Not gonna happen
Better not, anyway
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Ykf4R8lLM
hopefully it wont, but money talks
now that i think about, wouldn't that become a monopoly if Disney buys Hasbro, since they would own a majority of the entertainment market?
tell that to sony
lol
EA
So, nobody has Torchlight 2, huh?
if Disney buys a video game studios then I'll be scared
^
disney already has video game studios
disney will fuq it all up im sure
and then we have a rumor saying that Disney is thinking of buying Nintendo
OR
meh
They'll make a Disney video game console
i dont buy new games anyways
Disney bought out Valve

I've never seen it.
was it a cartoon?
Quayage
I can keep going
longest word I know that begins with letter Q
Quasirhombicuboctahedron
You googled that

Bout to post it
Peaches beat me to it

nope I know what it is to we made them in science class
I played fair and square

Seriously I know John de Lancie is awesome and all but
what if Tony Jay
What's wrong, Bronysith?
voiced Discord
Too deep
IT WAS A PAIN IN MY FLANK FOR 2 WEEKS OF creating the damn thing http://www.polyomino.org.uk/mathematics/card-polyhedra/quasirhombicuboctahedron.jpeg
CrimsonPhoenix: i would shit my pants considering tony jay is dead
His voice is an amazing villian voice, but too slow
hory sheet dat word
Bronysith, putting that fact aside
leave it to chemistry to come up with dem wrds
CrimsonPhoenix: you cant, he is dead
HoodyNinja, probably right
He is dead and forever will be
longest word ine the world with over 181k letters is also a chemical name
Bronysith, how unimaginative of you
Bronysith: You know, we have the technology...
thats quite cool PeachStreak
WHO
THE FUCK
WOULD USE THAT WORD?
People?
HoodyNinja: i use it as my password
twoiloight_spurnkle: word plz
HoodyNinja: Chemists of course.
Quyt
Bronysith: /) no one can hack you
Bronysith: I can google your password :I
PeachStreak: its 181k letters, how do you imagine i say it?
until now
One syllable at a time
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20222998 this is rather annoying news
HoodyNinja: you do realize how long it will take for you to type it out?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Zebrafari / Motherly Love
HoodyNinja: and get it verbatim without messing a single character up
HoodyNinja: i'll be typing it for the next several months
Chrysalis, OH GAWD WOW
Bronysith: Copy paste?
Bronysith: No wonder i never see you on here
CrimsonPhoenix ikr, one of the few decent chat systems
closing down :(
I hate fingernails...
HoodyNinja: simple solution
bite them off
Chrysalis, WLM was decent but I gotta admit Skype is gaining ALOT of grounds
/me 08,01fingernails HoodyNinja
Well, what is that word even for?
i like that they are allowing contact migration
but more people will end up going to facebook chat
which means even more friends i can't talk to
then again WLM was a microsoft product so this news just shows us that microsoft gives up
HoodyNinja: the name of a molecule iirc
well, they are focusing on the more popular product
Chrysalis, why?
considering they own both makes sense
I hate weather
I mean why would your friends go on facebook when they can migrate in skype?
hm, chatsplosion
because skype is a PITA compared to WLM
PITA?
pain in the ass
not for me
I remember when you could show your screen on Skype for free.
(btw guys crimsonphoenix is my skype name add pls thanku)
nope
it is snowing outside and it's still fall! I wish I lived in California
twoiloight_spurnkle: Dafuq is the molecule? Magic?
HoodyNinja: heck if i know, i suck at chemistry
Bronysith, have I ever told you how much I love you?
Got to be the most useless name ever
08,01there's a chemical called arabbitol
CrimsonPhoenix: you are an ass to my friends, leave me alone
08,01because it looks like a rabbit
181+ k words, no one is ever going to use that
08,01there's also fucitol
Bronysith, well I love you
Ah, true love
The early kindergarten stages
you bronies are all laughing at me. I'm feeling like a peice of shit just took a dump on me
What
The fuck?
lolwat
kidzrul732: are we supposed to care?
Why would we laugh at you>
yay!

I guess you're feeling
I'm confused.

Bronysith, can people change?
Everlasting_Joy: Aren't we all? No
kidzrul732: We're laughing at you?
I might be laughing
Is it funny?
HoodyNinja: I was refering to kidz and what was going on there.
i was eating a porkchop
Everlasting_Joy: :I
but now i'm laughing
PORKCHOP SANDWICHES
no I feel like I'm having a bad day

Why was everypony losing there minds
Hey Shizuka

Oh wait, there is a LunaXShizuka ship

/me hugs Luna again
I have the opinion that Luna has a ... Luna signal, that is NOT the moon. Everytime Luna appears, EVERYONE takes notice. It's kinda like the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE, only a lot quieter :)

/me 07,01hesitates
I always love it when they have you follow someone and the person is slower than you.

Glomps are free
Everlasting_Joy: I hate that
Hugs are never free

I'm not a tissue ;~;
07,01Mmmm better
/me volunteers for blanketing duty o_o7
dawww Luna
/me hugs, snuggles by Luna and offers her a Twi plushie
The fat. The Insulating. The Kurrines. -_-7
by the way guys http://fav.me/d5kd8bv
For once, I'd like to see this whole cliche deconstructed. One where nuking the enemy early on is the ONLY way to avoid incalculable civilian casualties, and the scientist arguing to find peaceful alternatives is merely in league with the enemy and the whole story ends with him/her standing trial for treason.
/me hugs luna
sonicdude558: That had better not be Wre-K's Twi plushie.
nah
how was your day Luna ?
Everlasting_Joy: i got that for him
it was this - http://i.imgur.com/JuUXf.jpg
CrimsonPhoenix: Already in my favorites. :)
AJIsAwesome, have you read Background pony?
sonicdude558: Okay.
CrimsonPhoenix: Not really in the mood of reading any fanfics. :)
Luna, your mane is made of space and stars, how are you not cold all the time?
They put so much filler in the end of this
emangamer: Magic. ;3
07,01I don't know emangamer I think I got used to it
nice find CrimsonPhoenix i just finished reading the latest chapter least night
AJIsAwesome, how can you fav an art that is clearly from a fanfic if you haven't read it?
screw Wre-k, mine is made out of Minky :P
07,01also magic
Wait, is that guy the brother of the TF2 medic?
*:3
/me 07,01nods
Damn magic
so OP
RoboGerbil, he updated 18 right now
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't have to read something to like something that come from it. :S
Did you just say yes to my Twi plushie Luna?
*came
shoulder fired nukes? yes please
CrimsonPhoenix: i didnt want to sleep anyway x.x
Trolololo
oh whatever.
/me gives Luna his Twi plushie
/me 07,01hugs Twi plushie
/me 07,01loves plushies
You dont have a Twi plushie sonicdude558
I'm back
/me pulls out his fat fleece tail
/me the plushie poofs and turns out to be a log
Who's streaming what?
/me gives Luna a moon pie
Welcome back, AttackWithHugs! :)
emangamer: naruto the abridged series is the worst abridged series
Wait a minute. She's giving the general grief about wanting to nuke the monsters, believing that they'll absorb all the energy from the nuke. And her more reasonable alternative is overloading them with energy.
Howdy AttackWithHugs!
/me wishes he had a plushie...
om nom nom nom
Luuunaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Shizu's streaming, Crysis I think. :)
/me glomps Luna!
Hi AttackWithHugs :)

http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352336921911.png Lulu
AJIsAwesome: Wow :O
emangamer complaining about someone else not contributing to conversation? Did I cross a dimensional threshold while I wasn't looking?
AJIsAwesome: yes!
Infinite ammoz.
What's this? A cool FPS?
it'S crysis
Nah this is a tepid FPS.
Where do you keep getting these pics Bronysith?
emangamer: *satirical
the FIRST one
Lukewarm
Crysis 2 to be specific.
DerpyMuffins: the lovely site of 4chan
he's getting them from /mlp/
note how it is much better than the second one
>alien entity
Everlasting_Joy: no, it's crysis 1
heils* if that's a grammar nazi referance.
XD
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352338542050.jpg Lulu
Smack that thing in the neck :P

Dark_Horst: A'ight.

"Nomad, I am your father!"
CriticKitten:No, Like A Faust
DED
Or yes.
Meanwhile: nightvision
otakon: Still green.
LOL
HORY BUCKFLUFF AAAAAAAA
you recognise crysis 2 by the downgraded graphics, dumbed down gameplay and basically a whole different species of aliens
USE NOOKS
also holes in the story
Something that giant just plopped down on the deck of a carrier? XD
It's a giant squid robot alien thing.
Just roll with it.
oh yeah, crysis 2 had no bosses. really missed the fucking bosses
GAAAAAAAAH
Wow big Jellyfish
Meanwhile: Vampire Robot Nazis who are also zombies?
welp they ded
emangamer: If they're vampires being zombies is kinda redundant.
also, if you'rew wondering, she's playing with godmode and unlimited ammo
Stream can't take the awesome
Damn, it takes rockets to the face like a pro
Meanwhile: nah, because then they want your blood AND your brains, there's nothing left once they're done with you
/me slaps emangamer around a bit with a large trout
one should aslo mention that this game is quite hard when played vanilla
I obviously need to buy myself one
emangamer: In your case just the blood then eh.
WHY WON'T YOU DIE
ded
Meanwhile: oh wow, how cleaver and original
oh.
there was a trick with weakspots
emangamer: Sounds like the government.
nevermind :)
emangamer: Think you butchered that sentence.
but i guess rocket spam does the trick
AAAAAAAAAAA HORY $%#@ :[ this is WAAAY better than fighting Quadaxis AAAFXGWOKWCHWOMC

Nittany_Discord: What's your steam name?

So is this the part where the covenant invade?
Wait, so what's on stream? ._.

Meanwhile: no, that's not untill after Normandy Landing
XAX: explosions

What is Shizuka playing?
Lulu: do you mind if i join you?
crysis
XAX: Crysis, I think. :)
emangamer: But shouldn't that have happened before Shepard died?
07,01not at all
Derpy_Hooves: Micheal Bay, the Game.
seriosuly guys, it'S not that old
2007
otakon: Interesting.
Derpy_Hooves: Mistab. :D
/me curls in Jmo's lap and cuddles
/me sips coffee with Lulu
:3
Meanwhile: No, I think Shepard dies after the chosen undead rings the first bell of awakening
JUMP JUMP JUMP JUMP
Dark_Horst: True but it is incredibly mediocre.
/me squeezes AttackWithHugs
you'd think a game that was the most grphacally advanced game of his time.... and possibly todays time still, would be remembered
emangamer: But I thought Aragorn had that.
Sorry, Derpy_Hooves. :D
Meanwhile: not really
Meanwhile: Nah man, Aragorn has the mirror sheild
Dark_Horst: Yeah, really.
/me 07,01smiles at RDash5000
This is a VTOL. Just go *up.*
Woah
Dark_Horst: Just more proof that graphics don't always make a great game.
07,01you like strong blends too?
Meanwhile: then you've been doing something wron
BOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Another tab fail?
Dark_Horst: If having taste is wrong I don't want to be right.
Everlasting_Joy: thing is, the game WAS great
welp she's dead
you shouldnt listen to meanwhile here
AAAAAAAAAAAA hory fluffs
Lulu: yes. :)
jeez that's... scary...
Took that thing down Like A Faust
Everlasting_Joy: Nah, don't listen to him. It's very very veeeerry average.
Excuse me, resurrecting a meme here.
DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAD.
Meanwhile: does that make you a hipster?
shame on you Meanwhile
no
hipsters dont have taste right?
GO GO GADGET BA-BOMB
you know opinions are fforbidden
Meanwhile is best hipser.
/me has hot cocoa
Dat Pondoo
emangamer: If I were a hipster I'd go on about how DOOM was the best game ever. I've never even played DOOM.
O_O
dat whirlpool
Meanwhile: has Master Chief killed bowser yet?
Outside of the "I want the player to see the sinking", wouldn't you have closed the hatch by now?
emangamer: Probably.
Like. A. Faust.
Nope.
Take the V-tol Nomad
crysis gave you absolute freedom of movement in the missions and had it's gameplay change continuously during it'S progress. and everything it did, it did very well. not mentioning that the idea with the nanosuit was brandnew back then
crisis is a pretty bad game imo
Yes.
how the HELL is Prophet alive?
*crysis
/me squeaks and stabs Jmo with her horn
it has a lot more than jsut fancy graphics
/me casts an epic experiment where x= 7
What, do you have a problem with it? I mean, it's not like you're going to do it yourself.
otakon: Narrative magic. (snort snort)
Halo clearly invented FPS.
/me flips 2 temporal mastery's and an increasing devotion
no XAX
Evening bronystate what we watching?
WOW awesome, now Crysis is spoiled for me.... :D
/me attacks Meanwhile with 5 1/1 humans
emangamer: but you fail to realize... that x ALSO equals 6.9 repeating!
Bravo Shizuka, Bravo!
wait. thats it?
GoldenEye 007 did
Quick game. :P
Hi, Conyst. :)

Conyst: Crysis.
Hey Scoot-Scootaloo~

/me claps for Shizuka
/me uses 1 mountain, black lotus, channel and fireball
rdash: well, you missed about 95% of the game
well, that's an abrupt ending
You have to ask if it's dead first.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Colorless/10
That's how it works.
Hi Scoot-Scootaloo :)
/me snuggles by Lulu again
/me shakes head disapprovingly

Conyst: You don't question the MLG legitness of shizu's computer >:/
^
'Lo Lulu.
gfdi
emangamer: you already had your mana tapped
RDash5000: that was jsut the last level. outro. remaining five minutes of the ovie. now, at this poitn crysis 2 was supposed to pick up and continue the story. somehow, that didnt quite happen though. started woith huge story holes
Except the MLG part. :3
11,01It's Lulu in regs!

07,01thy princess does not forget about BronyState
emangamer: congratulations, you won the virgin for eternity award
your channel fireball went on to make Channel Fireball
Lulu: Don't say that.. they are bronies, remember Luna? :P
13cosmos i guess
They could run that for 15 minutes at full settings on a supercomputer before it started smoking.
Bleh.
Lulu: oh, well still good to see you :)

Mom's Spaghetti!
Indeed.
His palms are sweaty?
There's vomit on his sweater already.
Spaghetti is in bloom
Page 349? Geeze that is a small reference
And for some reason, the line "open your books to page 394" escalated to a minor harry potter meme.
Mom's Spaghetti?
Meanwhile: Lupin teaches DADA in PoA and he misses a class. Snape teaches the class for that day and says "Turn to page 394."
08,01and working again \o/
I herd u lik hary pota fluffeh
:3
Ok. I fail to see how it was at all relevant, but ok.
Meanwhile: Page 394 is the page in the book about werewolves
Oh, it is?
See I'm failing to see how that's relevant.
Are you implying that I'm a werewolf?
I thought it was about wizard tic-tac-toe
AttackWithHugs: Snape is an a**
Remus Lupin is a werewolf. Snape did that to see who would realize the connection
Huh.
I know this, I read the book.

Too funny.
Bullies?
Jmo: Share.

i just want some sleep :'(
How is that even
wat.
Like no so often it echoes in the very fabric of reality.
Unless we're looking for Equestria, Krypton or Gallifrey, I really don't care that much about looking for crap in space.
flutterchu is probably just a super-genius whos intellect we cant comprehend
see we ducth are good ^^
Like no so often and so loud that aliens coming towards us turn around like "nope"

Stallion_of_War, any other planet that might support life is fine.

05see my point?
And Doofenshmirtz has a woman's face and Perry the Platypus has a man's face
Wrek it's over finished
Wrek, alright. I see.
Wrek: your REALLY hard to look at, your font is very unnoticable, can you make it blue?....blue's my favorite color.......:P

Make it luminescent green.
05flutterchu: your name is very hard to look at, the combination of fluttershy and pickachu very noticable. can you make it about killer robots? its my favorite kidn of robot

killer robots and pirates
Wrek: your my oppisite?
twoiloight_spurnkle, how is it annoying? I like white
Wrek's colour is rust from my client.

05point being: i wont change color, period.
CrimsonPhoenix: idk, bright white hurts my eyes
Meanwhile, you're using mIRC, right?

And don't have fun.
my pings are yellow font on orange BG though I doubt anyone would care
Wrek: oh-oh i LOVE BLOOD...it's so delish....wait, I THOUGHT YOU WERE EVIL FLUTTERCHU!!!!!!!!
Meanwhile: It looks like a regular brown and I'm using the same client. I guess the client you're using and what your screen settings are sometimes changes color
Why not, Meanwhile? :<
AJIsAwesome: Because fun is not fun.

all the floof
05thank you.

Adventure Time....I've never watched it

Tovler: By the way. How was the episode involving the Ice King and Marceline turn out?
I tried watching an episode, but got bored.
\/
I think I'm missing out on something by not doing so but I'm not sure
AttackWithHugs: It's probably one of the only saving graces of Cartoon Network. But you dont have to watch it, I don't think you're missing out on much. :)
One of my friends has that ringtone from Regular Show
i like Adventure Time lol and lol AttackWithHugs thats cool what is it?
The one that goes "Something something ringtone, pick up your telephone"
AJIsAwesome: It didn't get many feels at that episode… at first.
Or something like that. I don't know.
Tovler: What was it mainly about? :)
AttackWithHugs: ah...yea i got nothing lol

I'm not an avid fan of the show, but it's a pretty good one.
:'( Now I've got that song in my head again.
lol
brb guys need a drink
so Shizuka's streaming?
yes
oh boy
Much better than that "Annoying Orange' show they managed to get on there. Why did they need to have the CONCEPT for a show like that? :S
I think Shizuka is the only mod (that I know of) that streams sciency stuff besides How It's Made.
AJIsAwesome: CN tries to get Good ratings?
What in Equestria am I looking at? http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352349966259.gif
Annoying Orange is annoying, but he's orange and orange is my least favorite color, so that makes him special, in a bood way
for the station i mean
Annoying Orange shouldn't even had a YouTube series, IMO
CrimsonPhoenix, a fish man?
The point is its supposed time be annoying
Is that FRED show still on Nick?

Ponies47 ^^ hiya
Meanwhile, yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
Panda-: I blame killjoys.
05as are all the movies with sex scenes
Panda-: Oh okay, basically Wrek's been suspended from streaming because he showed a Penn & Teller thing dealing with porno
CrimsonPhoenix: Tactical Slam Jam Mashups incoming
well, Game of Thrones "bodies" are like Travel Channel bodies
well, that pen and teller episode kinda was bordering actual porn
and with that I'll be off

Cheers Wrek.

Got to go for the night...
I can see why Brave got its complaints
I posted gore only after two weeks of being here. SHUT UP! I was still considered a newbie! D:
I got banned for a hour ;A;
You still are.

Kicks. Most of the time it's just troll kicks now
Wrek was the first mod to ever kick me :3

Oh yeah, and Scoots. :D

Wonder if he's gonna return
Hello OtakuTom
05welcome back RaveBrony
Hi OtakuTom

Ah, Wrek, you do not disappoint :D
Hi OtakuTom :)

05anythign tiarawhy is NSFW
05no matter how you cut it
Hi, OtakuTom. :)

05Literally*
Tiarawhy?
Whats that? O_o
Wrek: actually that beepop twilight video was very much SFW and very good
RaveBrony, You don't wanna know
nsfw artist
._.
leave it at that
RaveBrony: Artist known for NSFW.
o.o
No stream right now?
nope
by the way the correct albeit still wrong answer because posting nsfw anything is against the rules period was 'I it streamed, ithought it was considered ok' which is still the wrong answer
halo 4 = sad end :(
Dont Tell Mee!!
Aaahhhhh
Dovah, >.>
I wont say any more
Im playing the campaign with my bro tomorrow!
lolol halo
I just got back from watching someone beat it on Legendary
Dovah: dont spoil it ;A;
i still dont have the game :(
i was banned for 30 minutes by Wrek, he also banned 5 other bronies permanetly, i guess he accedently banned me for 30 minutes, i struggled through those 30 minutes now knowing what to do, i fell asleep 4 times and they were 2 minutes each, finally i got to log on again and thanks to me the other 5 people are still here chatting, so i beleive i either save 5 bronies lives from chatting, or im just being stupid
Dovah, You son of a bitch! You spo...Oh wait why do I care I don't even play video games
That tl;dr
^
well i guess that last bit of the fluttershy tiarawhy video is a smidge bit NSFW actually
Just beat it on heroic the ending.. Gah!! why!?!
sorta kinda
Well, i can now say ive been banned, i suppose :D
So far my favorite of 2012 is
Wrek: Actually Sumi shows TiaraWhy's Bebop vid (The one with Twilight falling from tower)
twoiloight_spurnkle: yea sorta lol

hey Ponies47 ...why do you have ponies in your name?????
Wrek: I heard they were doing some major work on the site so the chances of that would be less.
Prepare yourselfs :D
Ponies47, adult males? What has this world come to??
:( Used to watch Sailor Moon and Totally Spies without thinking twice about it being girly
ERMAGERD YER ONE OF THEM, Ponies47
LOL
It will be chaos. The fandom has grown so much
I have to go to the bank to talk about getting a mortgage...I guess that's a little more important...lol
I did to, Tolver
I know that feeling Tovler.
I loved Totally Spies. :D
05well yeah but im not worried about the site
Tovler: Same here. :)
Ponies47: omg no way!
Tovler: totally spies was pretty cool iirc
^
Wrek: Trolls?
05im worried about stream providers and their servers :P
13so what would that be...
Totally spies <3
13sailor bros?
As long as a show is decent it doesn't really matter if it was made for girls or not >_>
Tovler, oh God, so I'm not alone XD

I use lightIRC because of the emotes. :)
In retrospect, I didn't like Totally Spies. Sailor Moon on the other hand <3

Countdown

ah
Phase4 why you have crap fps?
its fine here
Looks fine on my end
70 fps is good .-.
Gold_Demona! :D
Hiyo MadSurge :D
i always get 200 though
200..... That's unheard of. o_o
70fps is more than enough
Gold_Demona, rather easy on desktops these days
Another try
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 2 days, 3 hours, 59 minutes, 9 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Ahh better
Jake, it's not going to come any quicker no matter how many times you !cd
Maybe I need to upgrade my PC... I can only get up to 70
Gold_Demona, 70 is fine.
And that if it's behaving. It's kind of old and running kinda slow now.
I had a mssive ping timeout and my client shut down before I got the message
No point having 200 fps
Gold_Demona: I named my female Gligar after you because you're awesome :D (and Gligar kinda looks like a gargoyle)
MadSurge: LOL, I'm flattered. :D
Your eyes can only detect to a certain amount anyway, can't remember exactly what
AdamTheDuck Just faced 2 axis troopers with rifles i killed both with just a pistol :O
Somewhat around 30 fps
Phase4 on the dreamcast cpu it says potato
Gold_Demona: seen 278 mons, caught 150
MadSurge: Awesome. =)
Ok and bai again
Gold_Demona: I also hope I don't sound boring :D
killerpony7733, pfft, you're not a man untill you knifed 2 scouts and desecrated their corpes with the age old action of tea bagging.
MadSurge: No way. I like hearing your latest adventures in pokemon. :)
AdamTheDuck Hey i'm a veteran to the game so meh i have done my share of crazy things in that game :P'
killerpony7733, XD
As have I
Gold_Demona: I got a lot of evolutions, and I still haven't used the breeding thing :|
I'm old enough to remember the missingno glitch.
>.>
It isn't that old
Only like 8-10 years old :<
"only"
Jmo: Not everyone has played pokemon that long tho. :P
Gold_Demona: Missingno is one of the best glitches in gaming history
indeed
Missingno glitch is best glitch
LOL
Derpy WOULD have missingno
Ten million fluttershy's
I also really liked missingno's cousin ~~M~~
someone went through and reverse engineered how missingno works
Which is level 0 and when you level it up it evolves into Kangaskahn
Isn't it a bonus pokemon that was removed but not completely?
i should go through and find that
Gold_Demona, nah, junk data
heh
as are most of misingno's 'cousins'
Well there is the Lavender Town theory
which was a waste of 10 minutes of my life
Interesting that missingno only appears after talking to the dude in Viridian that's had too much coffee. :P
Gold_Demona, thats quite interesting, wana know how it works?
Sure, why not?
/me pokes the campfire
each 'map' has a bit of data that defines what pokemon can appear
and at what level
Yay a Phase4 story telling time
when you walk around, you cross 'load lines' that update this info
as well as other stuff, like loading data
cinibar island has no load lines
the edge of the map is marked for random encounters but theres no data
heh!
normally not a problem, when you swim there you cross lines anyway
when you fly, you dont cross load lines
now, after this round i'll finish
nvm, finish while map loads
when you talk to the training guy, his name
has to be placed where your name is
your name has to be placed somewhere
Also the old man "borrows" the protagonist's sprite
just so happens that it uses the same area where pokemon data is stored
Dat Sumica
so what missingno's appear is defined by your name
Heh!
So is this also what makes different level 100 pokemon appear there?
How everybody gets something different?
I always got lvl 100 electrodes
defined by your name
My one friend got a snorlax that knew fly
someone had the tables but i cant get them anymore :(
Gold_Demona: it's your own glitched pokemon :3
site wen toffline
Gold_Demona, what is particuarly interesting is the 'canonical' missingno
it just so happens to appear because of the 'end of name' character
Alright, false alarm on the Telstra thing, I'm a retard. You can all hit me if you wish.
the default names, unlike custom names, dont have null characters in unused spaces
instead its filled with end of name characters
/me licks Jmo instead :3
hence why that missingno is so common
heh
That's fascinating
Needs more Scootaloo
Another common missingno is the "female" one, that has an infinite and hideous cry
female one?
But first gen had no genders
Oh God
infinite cry
00,10I am enjoying this game far too much
Gold_Demona: its name is just the female simbol
Sumica, which game?
MadSurge: Ah
Hey guys i'd better hop to bed talk to yall in the mornong ok and thanks for the stream phase4 your great buddy
hi everypony
00,10The iOS pony game
night Moopy
Goodnight Moopy
anyway to stream gameplay sumica?
Sumica, so what's the name Time Turner or Doctor Whooves?
I'm jealous of you Sumi. I can't play that game. :<
Time Turner.
THERE
Official Canon name
hi
Ohai XAX
Sumica same .... what is wrong with me also gameloft id ?
dat chiptune
00,10Dont have one
AdamTheDuck: I also got BF2142 going again tonight :D it was awesome playing Titan mode again.
stupid broke eclipse
00,10Says time turnner
XAX, oh my, I always wanted to buy 2142 ;~;
00,10also has the dude and the jesus
I'd like to think Time Turner is his "regular pony name". Like how John Smith is the Doctor's "regular human name".
AdamTheDuck: It's so good ;_; but there's a VERY small amount of servers left now. Don't bother getting it.
i need a server like this one in aus
URGGGH You guys are impossible
CrimsonPhoenix, ?
00,10Guess i better set up that ide thing so we can shre shit eh?
XAX, yeah, that's what put me off buying it.
Lawl.
Eyup
Phase4, fanon vs canon stuff
also can't reall advance a lot of "quest" without it
really
and how people will do ANYTHING to get their fanon facts believable when anything related to the show suggest otherwise
AdamTheDuck: When I say VERY small amount of servers, I mean about... 7?
see DJ-PON3 wearing contact lenses excuse
XAX, oh my...
/me still awaits a Battlefield 2143...
Egh, I guess the Gameloft game still not available on mobile
MadSurge, I don't think it will
00,10Ok done, chace_sumica
Gold_Demona, theres also a good explination of the glitch city bug
AdamTheDuck: It's rather sad, really. It was an amazing game.
Phase4: We Pokemon now?
XAX, ?
Phase4: There's a Glitch City in pokemon R/B/Y. Is that what you meant? :p
Sumica done, you must accept the friend request
XAX, yes
ded
Phase4 fell for her trap card.
Phase4: Heh. I'm actually playing back through my Red. I've been asking people here to name my party. I'll come to you for a name once ive decided on my next party member because I'm an indecisive fuck.
well at least i think is done
i should stream pokemon some time
do a few bugs too
problem with emulators though is the unimplimented instructions
Phase4: CATCH MISSINGNO.
lol
and unlike the nes no documentation exists
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352373752923.jpg end of season 4
Phase4: I wonder how KH2FM would run on the emulator I have with FMLE running...
Instructions Phase4? .-.
AdamTheDuck, cpu instructions
Phase4: Tried to play CSS while running FMLE to see what it would be like. Oh god missed every shot I fired
00,10Dont see any request
night peoples
Goodnight JRP2234

http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352355302748.png whoever did this photoshop is going to be hanged
00,10So how often dose derpy show up?
Sumica, in this game?
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352348091617.png
00,10also i have notice so far, all shops genorate 2 bits a second
00,10sorry Phase4 refring to the ios game
/me glomps Phase4 ontop of Sumica
ah
/me hugs Bronysith and Sumica back
00,10so the best way to make bits is to have as many shops as you can
Sumica dunno i have found 4 in a row
Hai everypony :3
00,10and it seems the productions on shops keep going and just pile up waiting for you
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352348194258.png
only on 4chan
I'm starting to question my eyesight
Or my dad, apparently.
i just put the lemon stand 3 ponies 203 bits every 4m 30 s
Good morning :3
00,10yeah the 3 pony bit works out better
yay, my copy of armored core 2 is on its way to me
00,10er no it dont
00,10that's 1.33 bits a second
00,10you are loseing out TheGreatAndPowerfulT or you typoed
well i'm takin in consideration that if i use severl shops i have to time every single one
00,10it seems to cary over production
not really
00,10as in you dont lose out if you dont gather
Hi
if thats true the indeed having severl shops s the best choice
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: how much is this app anyways?
free with in app purchases
of course...
and the name of said app?
pretty much like any facebook game
Freenium, as they say.
Bronysith My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic
so its just like any other facebook game, but with ponies?
let me check if you seriously don't lose if you don't gather
Buying bits can cost up to 100 bucks
That's Gameloft for you
lol they will never see a cent from me
Okay, what?
I think I found a fake article
Not from The Onion
"iPad 4 crushes PS Vita in graphics performance"
You must be kidding
Sumica my shops seems to stop producing until i gather
00,10ah
If that's true, we should've already has a PSP emulator for iOS now.
so yeah if they do that i rather just keep my lemon stand
when i can check it every 5 minutes
00,10so longer timers are better for less activity
Someone is developing a PSP emulator for Android, BTw.
pretty much
longer timer = more money if you don't have the time to keep checking the app
Wooo Braeburn
00,10apple stand has a 40 min clock
bookstore have a 50 m one
well i have to shower and then go to school, Later everyone
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: eat gravy
Well that was a stupid idea. Hiding in the trees ._.
im afraid GaoGaiGar is going to replace Gurren Lagann as my fav anime
i'm done for tonight
/me glomps Phase4
00,10holy hell pinkie is loud
Sumica: you dont say

TheGreatAndPowerfulT: clop?
maybe try to sleep later
pfffft. Sleep
if you dont get sleep you die
well Ponies47 being sick + having imsonia = i have sleep a total of 4 hours in 2 days
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i hate insomnia
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: have you tried melatonin?
haven't tried any medication
it's over the counter stuff
this might sound crazy, but i want AVGN to review the Lion King games
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, :/
it is a natural ingredient found in the human body to help you go to sleep TheGreatAndPowerfulT
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: over the counter, get either a 3mg or 5mg and you will be able to naturally fall asleep
it is not a sleeping pill, just an aid
maybe will try it
Ponies47 also the most time i been without sleep it's been 3 days
o_o
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yea go ahead and get 5mg

Are you in the FB group?
DSHooves, No I'm not. I kind of hide the bromy stuff from my Facebook friends and keep my IRL self secret becasue I'm ugly. :<
I was the chick who did Spike's voice to tell Tara I had a present for her, and gave her a piccie.

CONFOUNDED KEYBOARD

Psh. Diapers are nothing
Bathing on the other hand, depending on the child's age, is difficult.
xD
I'm terrible with kids.
Toys at least can distract them
You are a kid, therefore you're terrible with yourse.f
yourself
:P
Jaymoo plz
Do you play the "Lets eat the candy TylonolPM" game?
/me Punchs Jmo in the face "shuda up"

I have to deal with a 4 year old, 3 year old, and idk how old the other one is cousins. It's chaos and drives me nuts ._.
Is that some medicine? :D

:$ hello Vivix!
Hi Vivix
Hiya MadSurge and Ponies47 :3
howdy Vivix
and Southern-horse, hii
I am actually southern :D
hehe
it's strange how close to southern horse your name sound- everytime I see you I think about it
You see me all the time, Vivix? 6_9
I see you now and again here yeah
I do hop in and out, hehe. Usually in my mornings, and maybe during the afternoons
Yeah pretty much same here, tend to hop out around evening time
o.o
I drop out only to sleep :D
I hop on before school and then usually I'm on for the rest of the time I'm awake after school
'tis a pretty swell place :3
mmmhm ^^
That it is, I kinda like the calm periods the best though
eeeyup
Need them calm periods since my days can be chaotic
Orly? Why?
DISCORD ALL OVER.
MadSurge: school makes it hard to have time to relax, hehe
Sylandest: Ah yes, unlike me and my lazy lazy ass demeanor :D
I've got two sociology exams tomorrow, and today, I have a presentation on the Sociosymbolism of family in Death of a Salesman
Ooh~~
That sounds interesting
:O
I didn't like socialstudies when I was in school, but- it sounds kinde nice now that I'm older
Sylandest: who wrote Death of a Salesman?
I basically have to present how Willy Loman and Linda Loman represented different aspects of family via their character in the play.
MadSurge: ...I actually forgot. Un momento.
Aww
You hate school.
^
I actually liked History, Math, art history, art and eh..chemistry/science
Hmm, never heard of him. Time to wiki I guess
Yup. Hate it to death. It's frustrating and depressing .-.
Heart about him, but we had more abot authors like-- Henrik Ibsen and such in symbolism and literature thing
'depressing'
Oh I loved "Norsk"--literature and essays
I liked school- we could get away with so much and just hang out and do school things all day
^
Still do. kinda.
I remember me and my roommate were bored one day, so he and I took the freezer's ice shavings from his fridge and mine, and we built a mini snowman. Posted it in the dorm's front lobby
Folk loved it.
Hehe
Nice
But it melted in like an hour ;-;
There is nothing fun about school. Well maybe it's because I hang out by myself and don't have any friends. .-.
AWw- yeah
you need someone to have fun with to enjoy it I guess
You know what I loved in school?
Screwing with the IT department.
Hehe
When we were kids we were the only nerds in school
Oh what I did to their computers in the library.
this was like...1998 I guess, so we'd change splashscreens- mess with the autoexec.bat- stuff like that
The guy was cool though
I couldn't make in friends in middle school and it appears the same is happening for high school. :/
Friends are over-rated.
:>
ahh- I suck at making friends, but like in college,orwhatyoucallit, people were really nice to me and I had my little group of people I talked to
Vivix you had no friends.
;__; I did tooo~~
Just imagine if I went to your college
Be picking on you all the time.
hehehe
ONe day I'd just lock myself in the cabinet and cry
You would.
Well I realized the same already has happened. I'm gonna be alone in high school with no friends. :I
Isn't it the law to finish high school at year 12 or are you allowed to drop for a job at 10?
/me Shrugs
Thank you ponies >_>
lemme think
We can drop out at year..11 I think
^ maybe
Lul
like 0 jobs, but--we can
The circumstances are different based on the state
what day is it today?
yeah
Of course.

Now canon.
/me canonizes Jmo
One more to add to my list of apparent shippings
with wat.
hehe
What am I canon for?
Canonize: officially declare (a dead person) to be a saint:
WAT?
:3
/me nerds out
canon--comes from "Authorative" or something- canonize is to make something authorative, especially in regards to the catholic church
so declare a saint- a sanction- things like that
so canon is like the authorative source or collective works of information or sometihng
/me useless fact of the day #1

MadSurge: Great. that's how you do it. :)
Flutterfan1: exactly
Wait....

If a game is fun then the graphics are not that important
How do you do that highligt with the text?
It looks rathr cool :)
rather
Yep!
So games huh?
Flutterfan1: can't do it on the bronystate page version of IRC. And in this channel.
Also only admins are allowed to do it
Oh no i mean the one where my name is highligted and there is a biping sound.
oh thats a ping lol like this Flutterfan1
Just write the name of someone
Or you get kicked.
Oh. So youjust type anothers name and then the sound comes?
or part of their name and hit tab
Flutterfan1: just type the name of the person you want to affress
*address

Doeett fluffeh~

Not that i hate android. I actually really like android.
wait, is the Android thingy a male or female?
Male
Ok
I'll draw two of them. One red and one green
Well no. Its just a mobile thing.
woops
Woo red.
Red for if the Android pony gets infected witha virus
Because smartphones can get viruses too
Heh
Green is for normal
But alas, back to cleaning. Shall be back later
Dat Max.
Ohai :)
Max bro, why'd you remove the shadow and apply that stupid block?
I hate the block xD
I removed it
You better.
but i havent updated
Looks terrible
agreed
Mane/tail looks good though
Im still half happy with tail
im pretty happy with the mane
Back legs look better
good :)
was the pose better/worse?
On the legs, is that suppose to be skin colour or shadows?
shadows
i may have to smooth it
some
Previous pose was better, shadowing is off abit
Doesn't look correct
I personaly like the new pose better, but do you think i should fix the shadows ? If so How?
Well mainly the front legs shadowing looks off.
Meh :/
/me slaps Vivix
xD
Stapit
Give us a hand here.
wat
linkme
ermagerd u r stoopid.
fff
/me was in geekchat
Help meeh :3
Um what? O.o
GET OUT OF GEEKCHAT
GAWD
:P
MaxTheBrony: Really awesome picture :D
Thank you Flutterfan1 :)
I like it, especially the tail is kinda sexy
oh my god Vivix.
but the shadow is a bit strong for that background light-
The shadowing.
ff
Yeah
Im not sure what i should have in bg
see how the light hits him on the face? but the groundshadow goes--down, rather than follow that direction
MaxTheBrony: Your welcome my friend ;)
:)
What Vivix said.
The background should be like ruins, ancient old mayan like ruins
or something of the sort
Yeah i have been thinking that aswell :)
MaxTheBrony: From Sweden?
Yeah
/me attends an epic brohoof to MaxTheBrony.
Finnish :3
/me finnishes the epic brohoof with GamerCherry :)
Wow cool ;)
Svensker overalt
haha :)
Keep your fancy words out of here.
hehe
Hmm so if i get you right
I swear I'll make your goaticorns suffer.
but yeah, try to imagine one light source, if you have two you have to have several shadows weaker
;__;
Yeah i can see that i have made two light sources now :p
one above the head
in front
and one below the legs
Yes you have, you silly fool.
NOW GO AND FIX IT!
Sunds rather annoying...
xD
Im on it , Im on it
You better be.
Damn Swedish.
I really like the bright light on his face, and the radient on his tail though, so I'd use those as main source
Yeah i like the "nose" :D but hmm
how should i do it
You throw your tablet outside and never draw again.
:>
xD
Nuuuuh
Jmo: Rude much?
hehehe
Take a joke pls.
Wow :O
It's our loveable jaimo
Haha XD
We wub him
haha
heh
Ew.
Wub.
/me wubs all over Jmo
XD
Ew
xD
Your goaticorns will suffer.
;__;
:O
I'm gonna draw Derpy being capture by Goaticorns as revenge!
haha
No you won't.
k..
Good.
:>
Poor Derpy 6_9
hehehe
should i change the armour of the pony by the way? or does it look okey?
and max you want to know how to line out shadows?
Lokos fine Max.
I love the armor
Looks*
and LOOOVE the tail
:D
but yeah try to find the source- of the light, like imagine the point wheere it comes from
Sorry gtg :(
and then use a straight-ruler to line it out
Bye :)
Toodles Flutterfan1
Take care.
shadows would follow that line pretty faithfully
Hello
take care Flutterfan1
Hello everypony!
You too :)
bye Flutterfan1 :s

Vivix, is he able to resurect himself for 3 days?
Wait so if the light is hitting the pony in the face should i keep the light on the back?
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
also: moin everypony ^^
Hai Invi :)
Heya Invi :)
Invi not really- but he can stay awake for three days
that's--kinda like jesus
Vivix, my brother achieves that while he is drunk ^^
Hehehe
Egh alcohol
and MaxTheBrony if the light on the back is weak, you just make the strongest light cast the shadow
it depends on how detailed you want your shadows
Aight

nermnermnermnerm
gluglugluglug

LOL
!
Lel
Screw the chavs
Oh my hehe
wut?
wat?
*right?
Lul^
if only DWR was here
Straight up chav right there.
Chavs are the people wearing their white nikes with their trackies and hoodies, shanking people and just generaling vandalising shit all day long/
Dey b gangsta.
...
white boi gangsta trash yo.
who the HELL wrote that?
I'd believe it.
...
Jmo: and YOU are from...?
Austraila mate.
:>
SHREEMP ON THE BAAARBIE
^
I read that like a YTP at first
Jmo: that means you're descended from criminals...
:P
Frekin oath.
This video is a classic demonstration of chav activity
Wanna mess with me bro?
BRITISH criminals at that
Chavs are the people wearing their white nikes with their white nikes
If only they all ended the same way.
otakon, also possibly from aborigines.
Jmo: are you aborigine?
Rev, that's even worse
Nope
there
British Convict
:P
I'm half Australian/British
Lul
or British Guardsman
Rev: up those friers, 'cause I sure am hungry!
dabi's face when he reads that.
I'm so hungry I could eat an Octorock@
Aborigines are supposed to be the toughest people on the planet from a genetic stand point.
MFW jaymoo is half British
England, Scotland, or Wales?
Half chav, half bogan.
Sup.
Mother is from England
ENGLUND
Rev: agreed
engluhnd
Rev: they live in Austrailia, the continent that WANTS YOU DEAD
Rev: Shame they can't put down the petrol for long enough to exploit that
Half frigging Russian
Oi
No racism.
Imagine if we find indeginous people on Antarctis
All right, I'm done
Vivix, do you mean the Inuits?
no, other side of the world
Vivix, you are an eskimo.
I know. But it's nearly the same.
Jmo: no they want to kill me
/me strokes a seal
Jmo: ALL of them
yeah you like that, babt
even the Koala's
Dropbear.
Rev: No. Just...no.
DROPBEAR.
Jmo: okay are those real?
They are.
Antarctica is the harshest of them though, I think
Legit stuff bro.
Jmo: you're shitting me
Nahp
FUCK THAT CONTINENT!
It is.
never going there
You should see our spiders.
Noooooo Homooooooo
They're so cool.
Whats up?
Jmo: I have, they have MANA BARS
LOL

I have three on my ceiling currently, it's a family.
Wha?
Bogies?
Gross.
Na, spiders.
Call em what you want.
Weirdo.
I will.

Cuase it is broken?
Wait, you ccan't feel a broken finger?
Never heard of that
Break it enough I suppose.

Freeze it
Then it must be hanging for the tip to not feel it
the nerves gotta be served off
severed*
:s that torture technic
The point here I suppose is that you would never get that far through conventional means
So... The pain would never stop although a different experience was explained.
Its all apart of my ploy.

INB4 S3 is last series
D:
RaveBrony: I sold blind bag miniatures for a while...when you get to the checkout with 26 blind bags on your arm, there is no excuse left...if it doesn't kill us, it makes us stronger ^^
; - ;
D:
Ifi t is...
Hasbro.
Everlasting_Joy: Parents will be all "Wtf" and i just pick up my pony stuff, smile at them ,and leave :D
jinx...
S4 was confirmed, s5 was rumoured
If MLP FiM was cancelled just after S3 I will die alone
Rainboom: cheaper caskets
RaveBrony: :D Aww yeah!
I totally hope it does get cancelled.
Murder....wait what
My world would be empty if the show ended after the season ended.
So many delicious tears.
Then Man Up Hammer?
If MLP does get canceled... I will remain here. I will stay faithful. <3
I won't-
RaveBrony: Oh, you know me too well.
DaringDerpy: It won't
umm tom its in maybe 3 or 2 days dude
Hah
It's just a TV show, and it has to end some time.
lol troll
It might be a pretty good TV show, but that's still all it is.
he ain't even
Moopy 1 day 20 hours
I would probably think it would come back on due to popular command if it got cancelled
Trolllling...Trolling......Trolling down a river.
they see me trolling, they hatin'
my guess is S5 will be the last
As much as I love the show and the community... NOTHING will make me as upset as Inuyasha ending, lmao
lol G5
G5?
g5, wat?
When FiM ends, we'll just become BrodyState and play Brodyquest on repeat forever and ever.
But my phone says its in 3 or 2 days Vivix
bronystate has been taken over by cynical defatists
boooo
Moopy ponycountdown and cd counts to nov10 15:00 UTC, right?
Actually I think he's always been like that.
NewSuperBronyU: When G4 ends, I will stay here. I ill remain faithful to the thing I love. How bout' you?
11,02BronyState will become a political activist party for Republicans!

Vivix: I've seen other communities die before...30k unique users a day...10 years later every two months a forum post "what happened to this place"...the rest is ruins...incomplete projects
Dari Meh, I wouldn't mind coming back now.
Dr who came before that iirc
I like Dr. Who!! D:
HoodyNinja: i think he'S aware of that
Well...i liked that one actor guy
DashWithRainbows: rejoin, there is plenty of fresh meat
DaringDerpy, oh yeah, this place will die eventually. When MLP eventually ends I probably won't be heeere anymore
Not to crazy about the others :(
Well
Dr.who started I the 1960s
Imagine it would be like 10 years after the show ends, and we could have a reunion....That would kick some ass.
In
The only way I can rejoin is via invite.
I can't, you're not in my friends list
:P
11,02My sister is the only one obsessed with Dr. Who here. She went out of her way to paint the door to her room as the blue police box from the show.
I never met a irl brony
xD
NewSuperBronyU, lemme tell you a secret about this place. When G4 dies, this place will almost definetly die too. There will pobobly be 30 or so people left. I will be here. I will help mold the site into something new. It will not be forgotten. *Sparten battle cry* But for now... Lets enjoy it. :3
Ohhhhhh
Everlasting_Joy: Succeeding*
should do that before the show ends
NewSuperBronyU: That's HXC
Everlasting_Joy: SB tries, and I appreciate that
11,02BlazeAngel: Moo :3

NewSuperBronyU. Oh myyy...

No offense to any of you, but i would LOVE this to be a nice small chat group :D
RaveBrony... :(
I find it interesting but not something to obsess over
That 105 isn't even talking...It's like maybe 50 of us talking ATM
Dari You know I would probably spam you pictures of Matt Smith if I was on your friends list.
Less than that
You'd probably send me spider links.
about 20
And I you with spiders and

RaveBrony: I enjoy the chaos of huge chat groups...if you get to know everyone and his quirks, things become repetitive
You know me too well

o.O
wonderful colour work, and the lighting on the stones look good too, consistent with the lighting on the pony
;it'
'it'
MaxTheBrony, that floating fortress looks abit off.
It was a test ^^
Gave it about 5 mins
Rocks are good though.
maybe give it abit of moss
dunno
Dem rocks took ages D:
Only a few hours, quit your whining.
I like them, they make it look desolate
First person to ping me with a word that describes Romney gets a cookie. :3
Mitt
like rocks who are in dry, cold areas
BlazeAngel, a tool.
13unelected
Do I get a cookie?
/me gives jmo a cookie
MaxTheBrony, what tablet do you have.
SUP
:3
Panda: A wacom Fun tablet
fun tablet?
what dat?
MaxTheBrony, what format are you exporting? There's some artifacts on the fortress-
It's the type of tablet.
its something like that , Fun and touch
Just a fancy word.
I think it's the entry-level Wacom, good stuff
MaxTheBrony, fun and touch? sounds like my gf.
:P
>_>
I'VE GOT BALLS OF...
Copper.
Well the fortress is getting refined if it fits in this picture
MaxTheBrony;A; gimme yo tallent.
Steel?
/me dusts off swedish
jette bra
;D
Oh...
BlazeAngel, do they taste like blood? ;)
Panda, you do great work anyways
Panda: NAh man , i have been working my ass of for 3 years to get this :P
I kinda like the fortress as a silhouette, but it's just got a green artifact going on
Panda, no, but they conduct electricity pretty well.
Dafuq?
wat.
BlazeAngel Wouldn't that hurt? :D
MaxTheBrony ;^; Ive been working my whole life and I'm not THAT epic
this is what i come into
killerpony7733, Nope.
BlazeAngel... can I have you DA now ;^;
Hello twoiloight_spurnkle.
I have wet dreams of rarity tounging my butthole...
Is this normal?
BlazeAngel, you have a da?
...
Panda, thou shalt never hve my DA.
one sec
TehFourteenth pls go
k :(
hei BlazeAngel
One thing that you need to improve , is accepting people criticising your art :D
BlazeAngel, why not
Yeah like this.
BlazeAngel: where's your +
MaxTheBrony, you suck at drawing
:>
XD
Hehe
I have my + dude.
Then i will become better!
o
^
Criticize is good, that and construction and colour
MaxTheBrony... if you ever need a critique, just gimme a holla ^^
it didnt appear until i refreshed
MaxTheBrony sucks at drawing. >_>
Never give up never surrender
I mean I'd advice people to read colouring theory
xD
ikr BlazeAngel.
Panda: I will :D
DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE!
So Should i keep the flying fortress or make something else ( if so ,What)
I kinda like it- but maybe make it not float to add to the--empty cold feeling of the world?
Like it fell down or something-
Ah yeah
YARGH HRAGH FIDDLE DEE DEE.
Y U NO SING BRONYSTATE.
Vivix: I noticed waht you mentioned before , the colors are all messed up :s
13because we want to not sing
When i look closely at the dA
Pirates life is the life for me.
13AND WE DO WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE PONIES ARE FREE
yeah, try exporting with a higher quality
XD
cause that's jpeg or png compression- I think
YOU ARE A PONY?
ponies arent free, you can buy them at the slave market in that gameloft game
BlazeAngel By any chance do you play games?
wat r games
tech me 2 game pls
killerpony7733, what are these... games... you speak of?
No, no, jk.
Vivix: It was Jpeg , but wich is the best for drawings?
Yes, I play games.
BlazeAngel Heard of planetside 2?
BlazeAngel...
/me gives BlazeAngel 10 bucks ;A;
?
Hello Sumica :) excited for the new pony episodes? :$
Still no stream...?
/me receives 10 bucks
He wants your dA damn it.
^
jpeg and png can be good, but you have to turn up the quality- I usually save as png in SAI myself
Too bahd.
;A;
/me gives BlazeAngel his first born
wut.....
Nope. Not good enough.
Lol panda! :D
Vivix: Yeah me too, i maybe pressed wrong in this case
D: Oh no, Sick_icybeauti! Are you sniffly?
/me gives BlazeAngel his lucious locks
I have an essay and 2 chapter due tomorrow......MadSurge eyup
if you're using eh SAI you can preview how the colours will look while fiddling quality settings MaxTheBrony
aw dammit to hell. I put the ranch dressing in the freezer. Thawing frozen ranch is like freezing melted ice cream; It just don't work that way.
hi everypony :)
/me burns Panda's lucious locks
Yo thelonepony!
: ~ :
Sick_icybeauti: how you feeling right now?
Vivix: It still gets some of the messed up colors :s
hayo thelonepony ^^
Panda Try harder i think you need to offer something triple as much in value :O
Hmm
/me glomps thelonepony "Hai!" :3
Vivix: and i get not settings when saving as Png
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin back :3 Hi
/me give BlazeAngel a cookie
thelonepony: Certainly better than this morning.
/me eats the cookie
Nope. :3
good to hear :3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Tara Strong answering Questions on The Hub's Twitter Tomorrow!
Get well soon Sick_icybeauti :)
MaxTheBrony, they're fine in the orig right? You could try.. bmp or tga, but those are huge. JPeg should give you quality settings, but png gives you two bitrate settings I think
MLP_Brovakiin: Thankies :3
Panda
/me hugs MadSurge and Invi :3
Vivix: I guess i can just save the Image in Tga and upload it and delete the Image*
I have one weakness Panda. I'll never tell.
13blaze is ticklish
yeah- it might be super huge though, try playing with jpeg too- you might be able to get it almost perfect while previewing
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
heya Shizuka
Could i eat the + sign BlazeAngel? :3
O______________O
/me gives handkechieves to Sick_icybeauti
thelonepony: Don't do it!
/me holds up a feather to BlazeAngel, "NOW!"
NEVA
Vivix: yeah it was pretty huge xD
i wanted that + sign cookie ;3;
30k kb
Hehe, I think TGA and bmp are lossless- so yeah they end up somewhere around that
/me noms BlazeAngel's + while tickling him.
HAD ENOUGH?
heya everypony!
/me needs 20% more +
heya Sarah_B :)
Hai Sarah_B :)
Oh, MLP_Brovakiin is Sonny streaming right now?
Hi Sarah_B!
Sarah_B! Socks!
/me wears Socks
Hi Sarah_B :)
Hey BlazeAngel
Nice dA you have there.
Panda!
Uh.
how are things Sarah_B
Socks!!!!! :O
:)
thelonepony: I don't think so :)
They are good :)
/me hugs Socks :3
Everyone is always very exited to wear me it seems.
/me hugs back
I am just taking a little study break
Hai Socks :)
I want to wear you, too, socks!
AVAST
hi Socks and Sarah_B
I'm going to miss the pinky cloning episode next week....My school is holding it's cheer competition next weekend :(
gg BlazeAngel
:>
13bmp is huge because it's an awful format
Sick_icybeauti: Sorry to hear that :(
Hello MLP_Brovakiin and Invi and Sarah_B. I want to hug you all :)
Bai. And good luck, in your future endeavors.
/me hugs Socks :3
:|
/me hugs back
And probably every weekend until feburary...
13just ask phase sometime about how bad bmp is :3
/me dirties Socks
Oi!
:3
bmp? who uses that?
/me hugs Socks again :3
bmp is pretty bad, but it is lossless
Yayayayayayaya
13ys
I fully expect BronyState servers to crash on Nov. 10 as the majority of Europe have no where else to see it.
png is also lossless Vivix
all the time?
13but seriously bmp has massive overhead
Max was getting compression artifact, and I think that was png 24
jpeg is best format?
That was a jpeg*
oh okay
I had converted it wrong
or saved*
alright, but yeah I prefer png
png is always lossless Vivix
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BMPfileFormat.png look at all that crap
I've never done something with that much colour though
Ha ha! Finally done updating Ubuntu.
yyeah. seems it is shana, I'd never read up on it
Oh. Stream's dead. Consarnit.
Who was streaming?
And also chat.
Shut up, Emil.
hay i bet if i was a pony my Cutie Mark is a contoller
Kammerjunk: lolno
ohokay
Ohai Emil
What does everyone think that their cutie mark would be?
Graph?
Note~~
Socks: It wouldn't.
Mine would be a blank flank.
Socks: I'm working on it.
Socks: If I feel productive some day.
BlazeAngel: maybe a Angel set to blaze :PP
I'd probably be a blank flank ATM :/
Emil: :D
wrench, or something else related to engineering :3
not sure about my cutie mark :/
MLP_Brovakiin: The only thing I know about engineering is that they believe the glass to be twice as big as it needs to be :D
I don't get the reference, but oh well :p
MLP_Brovakiin: Optimists believe the glass is half full, Pessamists think it's half empty and engineers think that the glass is twice as big as it needs to be...
IT WAS ON XKCD!
Oh! :D
/me cries in corner on account of having no life
13the realist wants to know who drank from the glass
^
13the surrealist wants to know why a duck is riding a hummer
^
:D
Any more, I saw a whole list of them once but the engineering one is the inly one I remember :P
13capitalism, you have two cows, you sell one and buy a bull
13communism, you have two cows, the government takes them and sells you some milk
:D
the duck says, MOOO
13soviet communism, you have two cows, you drink some vodka, you have six cows
Hm.
Hey Everypony
Sound logic
Hi DerpDash
Hai DerpDash :)
Hi DerpDash :)
I can see 8 shizus right now. I need to lay off the vodka
/me falls over on a table.
I finally read Cupcakes
FML
that's cool
Shizuka the government fines you 8 cows
/me eats a taco
hey
Chrysalis: No no no. Thats india.
/me eats a Rainboom :P
13there's a couple where the government shoots you but i don't know them all offhand
/me eats a thelonepony
/me is eated D:
Shizuka: Why does Snoop Dogg need an umbrella?
For anyone who cares, TTEoAP has been updated. :3
how are things DerpDash
00,02i bugged steam on linux into downloading the bit trip soundtrack
/me 00,02is ok with this
why is everything on my tv in spanish? 6.9
alexxm: Nice other than the fact that I feel nauseated
Because Univison Rainboom
Shizuka: Fo Drizzle
hope you feel better DerpDash
/me is baning head on table from science homework...
Phase4 are you trying to get into Steam beta for Linux?
Univision*
00,02Barb|AtWork, yeah, not in it now but you can still use the client
thelonepony: I would rather have everything on the tv ponified
But, spanish is cool
Phase4 My buddy convinced me to get it on my laptop
Daul boot ftw,
Steam beta here I come.
00,02Barb|AtWork, : D
Watch. Free copies of HL3 for us first time users.
/me stumbles out door to buy laptop
/me wears everything blue and sings Im Blue
I took your wallet Vivix!
00,02laptop is best form factor
imagine if hl3 only comes out on linux
Ah he will figure it out.
hehe
I want to get a nice alienware laptop
Barb
13save your money
pls go
now.
That I can change the mobile card in.
13get a good desktop
Don't ever touch Alienware.
Jmo Okay. Just hear me out.
Or I will hurt you.
No, never.
Vivix: I would be happy.
13alienware is hilariously overpriced
I was in the same boat as you. THen I took one apart.
hmhn?
Lawl
ANd now.. I can't turn back.
13i matched a low low tier alienware build with a gateway mid-tier prebuilt
Oh yeah Kammerjunk, I'd smirk
I would never get a Alienware laptop
For Gabe Newell's birthday he was given a box, when he put $2.50 in the box it opened and gave him a hat XD
Gross.
13for about $500 less
Alienware is the apple of computers
You just said you wanted one
wat.
Dafuq did I Miss
who me?
No Barb.
Hm. I just want to be able to access the mobile graphics cards, and currently I know Alienware can do that
inb4 Randy http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=Xm88rF3GpLg&feature=endscreen
I need to do my research, cuase I would rather NOT pay for alienware
My mom's laptop cost $500 and has been a decent computer for me, as long as I turn the settings down to minimum on everything. But I'm really used to doing that on my older computers
Might look into that one company Steam advertises all the time
Or used too.
Falcon something or another.
everytime I read falcon I see foalcon
damnit internet
So wait what was your reason? I got kicked before I saw it.
I have an asus laptop, but I only use it for typing
I liked it when Falcon produced drinks
Me: I wasn't watching ponies! Friend: Then how do you know I blocked them? Me: I know, cus I dont know! Thats what im saying! God..
Socks, did that really happen to Gabe Newell?
KandarihuFastBreak18: Apparntly, I'd like to think so :D
That should totally happen.
I wonder what they'll do after half life
They were talkiong about "something that will change multiplayer forever"
Vivix Quarter Life
Hehe

A new IP, then?
Who knows- probably
I hope they don't go too avant garde
but- interesting to see what happens in the future
An interesting new game which will spawn a sequel that perfects the idea, and we hold our breath forever on a 3rd installment that never even gets announced?
yep
maybe it'll be usper meta
and the game IS waiting
the last person to disconnect wins something
a message- a game- abook, something exclusive
I'd---love that
Hey, everypony.

Re-Watching DBZ atm, ye gods it's CHeesy :D
Help me...I gotta write an essay, and it's goign on a website that checks for copying..HSLP!
HALP!*
don't copy, problem solved

But the way it's goign to be written is goign to ake them think I copied...
wb alexxm :)
Panda|Drawing: Wyup...
Eyup*
thanks thelonepony how've you been
Sick_icybeauti it's not enough that they "think" it's copied. They must have proof
ooh style is dubious? That's a hard one- provide TONS of sources?
/me hugstabs alexxm
It's an essay about Johann sebastian bach (It's for a music class)
/me stabs and burns Socks :I
13what about him?
13just... about him?
}:-)
13cause if so you should tell them that's a BS assignment
/me puts Socks in the naughty corner
/me had many assignments like that
like a bio Sick_icybeauti?
The intor is suppsoe to be a sort of "biography" then you go inot detail about how his music influenced shit.
intro*
WHose music?
Bach
08,01i regularly poop to bach
13oh whose music
Sick_icybeauti, ah. ^^ well just research who his influecnes were and who was influenced by him.
Johann sbastian Bach
13cause anyway
I like Bach ^_^
13just google "influence of bach on modern music"
Uh
13pick three examples
I've played his stuff sicne like 3rd grade...Gawd.
13BS at length on them
Baby got Bach :D
4 muthafucking paragraphs :(
08,01Sick_icybeauti: wow, heavy man
if you do that you deserve an F
13wait you only have to do four paragraphs? what kind of essay is this...
Sick_icybeauti, make sure that they arent blogs or anything like that.
Wait... are you in college or highschool?
I have wikipedia....Might be enough...
...
13bitch i did eight pages about DNS resolution using nothing more than one class on ARP
must be highschool
Panda|Drawing: High school
Some schools won't let you use wiki as source
hey bronies I was playing the new MLP app and guess what i found!
Sick_icybeauti: 4 paragraphs isn't a hard essay... it's not even an essay
...
yeah its not
They didn't have derpy in it!
I always use the sources given on the wikipedia page
Sick_icybeauti: Wikipedia is generally good, just don't quote it as a source.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic Variant for Issue #2- Midtown Comics
Whatever, in high school sense (I know college length, I have abrother.)
I just had to do a 10 page research assignment on the effects certain genres of music have on productivity... 4 paragraphs isnt really much of a hard paper.
and I advise that you dont use wikipedia as your central information site.
08,014 paragraphs is what... 3/4 of a page?
^
less I think
^^
13pretty much
08,01that's like 800 words, man
13depends on how much overhead you devote to name, class, date, title :3
Panda|Drawing: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ so much!
my paragraphs are usually short, so 500 words that would be
08,01you can rattle that off in 10 minutes
Socks huh?
:P
I haven't done a paper in years and years and years-
Sick_icybeauti, google what Shizuka said and thats alread enough for at least 10 paragraphs. and just do a brief bio...
I miss it~~
Vivix, you're the geek who loves homework.
Needs to be 2 pages
/me didn't do homework
LIAR.
2 pages....
:D
PURE LIES.
but IN school, it was fun to do interesting things
I didn't do homework since grade 10 I think
^
...
go to school Vivix
What is grade 10 in english years?
xD
lOL
13just use wiki
I will return to school once
I don't do homework, I just do it at school.
13pick out the important details
I want to do accounting or psychology
13then describe them your own way
Vivix PICK PSYCHOLOGY!
describe your understanding of them
don't rewrite bullshit you don't udnerstand
10 was the grade my motivation left me completely :/
^^
13that too
Hello?
I want to do zoology and psychology, but no jobs- so..hobby?
ohai Vicis
hi Vicis :)
Accounting might get you an ok job
Thankies. :3. It sucks what education has come too...Just preparing for a test...I find it depressing when the teachers say "The regents will have this" or "the regents have that" We're not learning...We're test preping...
Hello thanks for the warm welcome
Really? After primary school (Well, after ten years, I don't know what that amount to other places), I was excited.
/me hugs Vicis
Hell, I'm even more excited for uni.
brb darlings~~
so is there anything playing for any one?
Eenope.
nope
*Smiles at socks for the hug*
nope
okay thanks. just wanted to know if it was something on my end
I mgiht as well star now....I'll take breaks.
you should be able to squirt it out in less than an hour ^^
Am I the only one who gets more excited for each level of education?
I think you are.
Kammerjunk, nope, me to actually.
Kammerjunk: Seems like it. You must go to a good school.
No, it's just each level of education is worse than the last.
too*
/me has not had good school experiances
Nah, when you get to Uni, thats when the fun starts ^^
I think whatever you silly fillies call what's after ten years of school is great, and uni will be even better.
/me looks into the chat and sees this out of context: ''<Panda|Drawing> you should be able to squirt it out in less than an hour ^^''
I can't believe I hate education when in the middle easty, people get killed trying to go to school....
(We call it gymnasium)
WTF?
Invi whoops >.>
xD
Invi: :D
Invi: That's exactly what you think it is.
Gym lol
oh shit XD
it is? nice
Out of context? is it not clear?
Yeah that's my sign to go to sleep.
Sick_icybeauti: Yeah, gymnasium has a different meaning over here.
bye all thanks for the warm welcome. and if anyone got the reference with my name then u are awesome!

/me shrugs at Invi
Hi Serenity :)
Serenity was it pinkie?
13did you shoot them?
Serenity: Oh? Unsuccessfully, I take it.
Shizuka: They got away before hand
Double spaced...HAHA!
...
/me rolls everything
Kammerjunk: Yeah, they had a crowbar, but I had a gun
Sick_icybeauti, I assume MLA formatting?
Serenity: I like those odds.
A big gun
Panda|Drawing: 12 sized font, black, double spaced.....
inb4 Serenity flexs
13paragraph requirement or page requirement?
So yeah, guess who has to call to get their double glazing window fixed
13cause double spacing halves the amount of work you have to do
^
^^
We just get a set amount of words to write.
That's why word requirement is best
And making the punctiation bigger.
also
2000 word minimum! NAO
Yeah but can't you tell the amount of spaces easily
are you double spacing after each period?
I double spaced the first 4 words
if you aren't using 72 bold comic sans with double spacing, you aren't writing your paper correctly
^
with 5 inch margins
Anyway, I think a new window will cost me a few hundred
That goes out of my laptop funds
Buytoast: LOL
Serenity: Oh, that sucks.
Yeah, atm that means I can't afford the laptop, because I'm 200 short
Hey, there isn't a requirement to what type of font you can use.
not when you go to renegade high there isn't
Sick_icybeauti, then use arial size 10
ohai everypony!
Sick_icybeauti: We're just told to use what our teacher calls "antikva" (in Danish, not sure what the English word for it is). Basically, any font with footing.
Oh hi, Michael.
It needs to be size 12, but I don't see what tupe of font.
do you get word requirement in denmark? We always got page during my schooldays-
Hi Michael :)
type...Mother of jesus, I hope I don't spell like this on the paper...
you should use size 12 wingdings
that'll make you look exotic
xD
/me hugs Kammerjunk thelonepony
Vivix: Really? We only get word requirements on written assignments.
/me noms on Michael :3
Welp, AFK.
Huh-
Well maybe I'd get the same if I went to higher education
/me is nomed :3
Ohai again
ohai MaxTheBrony!

Ohohoho yeahh baby
Keeps getting more and more awesome max
:(
Thanks to all the feed back :)
I have a love for that tail- it looks almost like a mix of feather and tail-hair

MaxTheBrony: you made that?!
Michael|sad: Yepp :D
MaxTheBrony: Awesome :O
thelonepony: Thank you :)
MaxTheBrony: http://i.imgur.com/Vmnob.jpg

Vivix: Should i keep the rain?
Michael|sad: :D
:)
I'd say yes, I like the rain- adds some bleakness whithout taking too much focus I think-
i doubt i will be on saturday to see the MLP stream :(
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 17 hours, 41 minutes, 42 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
SOON
Aaaaaaand I'm about this close to quitting my job.
Vivix: Do you think i should redo it?
the rain?
CriticKitten: You're about 1 day and 17 hours from quitting your job?
lol
Less.
How come?
I'm debating quitting right now.
Aaand i'm back.
Vivix: yeh
Wb VenHur :)
ohai VenHur!
CriticKitten... its a job... job = money.. may people dont have them... you should be happy you have one.
MaxTheBrony, nah, it looks chaotic and good on the sizes on dA viewer- maybe- take away one of the splashes on the horizon of the rocks- but otherwise-
My school's assistant principals basically bullied me into accepting student work from the last six weeks because several kids complained when I insisted on enforcing a "no late homework" policy.
brb
...So, who's here that knows games that are completely forgotten or had low sales and reviews, or never seen barely in Top 10s¡
*?
So yeah no, screw the "be happy you have a job" shit, being unemployed would be preferable right now.
CriticKitten, and thats bad how? if they have a problem, fail the fuckers.
back
Panda: You clearly didn't read that sentence correctly. Try again.
VenHur: Can't think of any right now, but I don't read a lot of reviews.
I tend to find I disagree with critics.
Back :3
My policy is "no late homework". My assistant principals just FORCED me into accepting late work across the entire past six weeks due to student complaints.
Wb thelonepony
They very literally got together and met with me, and told me to do it.
CriticKitten, you have to accept late homework? I guess alll our teachers would go nuts
Yep.
VenHur Those are awesome, even though I never finished them, always got stuck
Our teacher would yell at the principla sometimes
CriticKitten: That sounds fairly silly. Why put a deadline if you're allowed to deliver past it?
indeed
Dat Shizu.
All aboard the shizumobile
My saying: WHY HATE?!
I'm being forced to accept late work for an entire six week period because my students are fucking lazy.
Not just assignments, either.
Quizzes too.
And tests.
CriticKitten, do you get actual money that goes in your pocket?
Starting to see why I'm a little pissed off?
That sounds frustrating, but I still envy your job.
CriticKitten, then let them write the fucking shit out of them
Kammer: Work my job for one week, you'll never envy my job again
Not because it's a job, but because teaching sounds fun.
It's absolute hell.
I have been a TA before, for over a year... its stressful, but its still a job.
if you get paid
I dont see the issue.
I've only taken it until now because, as was previously said, "it's a job"
CriticKitten: what job do u have?
VenHur: ........woooooooooooowwwwwwwwww
But now it's going way beyond the point where I can tolerate it.
And shizu stream
Il do some detail work on the drawing tomorrow :p , I gotta get some sleep naow :) Good night everypony!
yay, shizu stream
:O
Goodnight max
SHIZUSTREAM
oh look A Shizu stream
hey Shizuka
huh... must be a Sumica stream.
Shizustream, ahoy!
Panda|Drawing must be >_>
Shizuka time!
Link's Awakening is also underrated, but I seen some Top 10 with those games...sooo...it's in the between.
Panda: I'm making over 10% less than I did last year, despite all my bills going up in price.
Panda|Drawing: I could also get paid for standing behind the counter in one of those neat little shops by the gas station (What are they called anyway?).
am i the only one who thinks they should put a marathon of every mlp: fim episode leading up to the crystal empire
CriticKitten, you earn money....
nuff said
Yes, less. Not more. Our school district has frozen all pay raises, and instead we're getting massive CUTS to our pay.
if your bills are going up, quitting is a horrible idea
Panda: I can earn money at McDonald's, too.
Dat quake 4
find another job FIRST, at the very least
oh, Q4
Hallo ponies
And it'd be roughly as fulfilling.
/me le hugs shizumobile.
ohai shizumobile
This is a good game.
You people should get this game.
^
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire - Part 1" airs in 1 days, 17 hours, 33 minutes, 13 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
:O never played classic Quake ot this Quake
*or
The whole logic of "it's a job therefore you should put up with all the shit" is spoken like someone who doesn't understand the situation at all. There are some jobs where the pay clearly isn't worth what's involved, this is one such position.
Hello shizumobile :)
CriticKitten, then be smart about it. make sure you have the job at mc donalds before you quit this one... -__-
Kammerjunk Well it's definitely good like doom 3 but atleast it lacks all those overdone jump scares from Doom 3
fuck this day :[
Shame I can only play it when I go to a netcafé. I do have Quake 1 and 2, but I think Quake 4 is more fun (at least the multiplayer).
Hell, taking unemployment would be more fulfilling. >_>
killerpony7733: Those used to scare me when I played DOOM 3 as a child.
...
Bad news folks, I'd never owned any of the Quake games, you can sue me for that, but I never had aknowledge of the series.
VenHur: I pity the foo'.
Also content warning, this is definitely more gory that doom 3
Kammerjunk The atmosphere tbh was good not doubt but i just think it put too much focus on jump scaring you too much
You compain about not earning enough to pay bills... but if you have no job and 0 money... how are you going to attempt to pay those bills...
no*
Yeah, you heard me. Judge me all you like. You have no idea what I've put up with at this job.
that logic makes no sense.
killerpony7733: Probably. I can't really remember it very well.
Kammerjunk But overall it was a good game.
It is silly, but it's your life and none of my business
Um sir, you appear to be missing your everything
Especially ROE the expansion
I think I have it somewhere, actually.
O.o
'Tis just a flesh wound.
Doom3 was fun, but I hated the ending
I have both ROE and doom 3
VenHur: first game was about eldritch abominations invading the earth, second game was a race of cyborg aliens called the Strogg, 3 was a multiplayer game and in 4 it's the Strogg again
Vivix What for if i may ask? i'm curious
Panda: It's called unemployment checks. They'd be enough to cover the bills while I look for another job, preferably one that doesn't require throwing out every one of my principles. <_<
ah, Doom 7
I've only played Quake 4 multiplayer, to be honest.
killerpony7733, I remember getting reaaally excited about teleportatoin, story- strange stuff, and then it just ended with a bossbattle just when things were getting interesting
I haven't played it since though- the game itself was fun
Singleplayer is pretty good for this, does get repetitive at the end though
Panda: It's literally impossible for me to hold students to any standard if I can't even dictate how my own classroom functions without the kids complaining to get it changed. And if I can look forward to making less money every year, I'll have to quit eventually anyways.
what am i looking at?
Dark_Horst: Pixels.
Vivix Oh yeah i did like the cyberdemon but yeah the end was really just keep killing 4 enemies to fill your special item and hit it and just repeat no special stuff to do and all
Probably. I'm not sure.
Also you all know I'll be godmoding eventually right
Eeyup.
Vivix Not much sense of reward but ROE made that better though
CriticKitten, if you say no. I would rather squeeze all I could out of a job before I left it. but its your choice ^^
How's quality
RoE yeah- I shuld pick up RoE as it has thee eend sort of?
welp everyones ded
Good good
It's good.
shizumobile: Pretty good
kinga good
*kinda
Panda: I've definitely made up my mind. I'm quitting at the end of this school year. That gives me plenty of time to find another school to work at.
shizumobile: Great FPS, and the graphics are mixed on the textures, but DAMN sweet.
i used to love this game
Panda: I'm not just saying "I'ma quit right now and fuck everything", I'm a bit smarter than that.
Yeah textures are pretty meh
CriticKitten, now that sounds like a much better plan than quitting now- I hope you find something nice
you did sound like "NOW!" though, hence our bafflement
please respond
no
I'm quitting "now" in the sense that I don't see a reason to keep investing all of my energy and time like I was doing.
Ah okay-
sucks for the students
They don't mind.
but--they're the ones who messed it up
They don't care anyways.
seems like it
My favourite math teacher was harassed by a girl in our class
They'd be perfectly happy if I just made up grades (which, mind, I won't do).
she was horrible to him, and he was this nervous guy who looked like he'd cry every time she yelled at him
I still don't get that. How can they be annoyed you don't accept assignments turned in AFTER the deadline? What grade do you teach?
Oh the shcool system. How vast yet terrible you are...
I'm just not gonna pour several hours of after-school time into things like I used to.
yeah, I get you on that
give them a "You're fucking late" grade
Kammer: High schoolers.
why not just deduct a percent of the greade for late homwork
grades 10-12.
I remeber my science teacher last year would give you detention if you needed to use the bathroom. THE MUTHBUCKING BATHROOM! And she'd give referals if you were even a second late to class.
Not allowed to, twilight. I've been forced by these assistant principals to accept EVERY late assignment.
omg
thena ccept them and deduct two letter grades
And give full credit if they turn it in.
CriticKitten: I'd say they should know better, but being in that range of years, I know they don't.
wait
Sprunkls!!!!!
what
/me hugs sprunkls :3
That's the students yeah, but why would the principle assistants agree?
might as well tell them to hand in the assignment whenever they feel like it
Because my students are not only fucking lazy as hell, they then complained to the principal and made up lies about how I'm being mean and oppressing them.
05 I think?
Some teachers shouldn't even be teaching though....
He won't let me teext on my iiiphooone he's totally breaching my freedom of speeech
well, that seems counter-productive. id allow occasionalfew days late hw if i see someone is hard-working but coudlnt do it for a reason, but accepting all late homework isnt a good idea yeah
It doom 3 engine
One such lie was that I "laughed at them as they were taking their tests" which is a blatant lie.
<<----- Good quality game 'ere guys :P
^
shizumobile: Doom 3 WITHOUT expensive graphics? :P
It's from 2005, revolutionary at its time.
The kids in this school just disgust me. There's no desire for honesty.
CriticKitten: Parents.
It's so sad. What happened to having values and self-respect?
