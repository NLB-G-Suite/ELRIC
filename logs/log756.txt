and forgive me for being a dishonorable one but... I cheat.
Fetch a painted wall
Pain in the balls if you ask me

Time for SNS!
just haters that, maybe reported it?
Who's that again?
@Jose yeah but i dont use that cheat that much, i use it a bit
Oh, that one.
I actually think the time-cheat is enough to get money... only gems are still hard to farm
ponies and shops
that's it.
GAKKLEGAK

Goodbye!
I actually thought this was one of my favrtite eps
coloured as well
bye!
Is there a DropBox for it?
did AskTheCrusaders really draw every frame of that pinkie animation?
farewell
yes he does everything
well, Gnight everypony! *yawns*
AskTheCrusaders animates and he does not have to "draw" every single frame. But he does it frame by frame.
*hugs*
skiepz

Is there a dropbox for my request from Tsitra?
/me steals pony 811008s socks
back
lol
its a show for little girls, its good on the current tchannel
did you see the .MOV reference in the last episode?
Lifetime is a TV channel.
yes^
Was there a refrence?
Lifetime network = sitcoms and dramas where women are the lead characters
11:38
I feel this episode is just full of references
dotmahv
also the fanfic reference
Pinkie watches paint dry
with watching paint dry
http://www.sciencemusings.com/blog/uploaded_images/TreeRock-787792.jpg
I don't think that one'd be a fanfic reference.
But rocks can prevent nutrient absorbance
oh yeah, i said that during that part
Hasbro's cool nuff
Fanfic reference?
"Think of the dullest thing imaginable" "Watching paint dry"
I rather thing THAT one is a coincidence.
*think.
Trees can be reformed into pony shapes by Rarity! Epic win
A socks reference, which now makes it canon
That's actually a thing outside the fandom, you can't really say it's a reference
Honestly I don't think watching paint dry is the most boring thing
No, but it's the standard answer.
Nice *-*
well the fic is about the philosophical musics of pinkie pie as she... well.. watches paint dry :)
raaah
"It's about as interesting as watching paint dry/grass grow"
*musings
The writers have repeatedly stated they don't read the fanfics, though.
yes
I got album title here today at 3PM. 9 hours later I've listened to professional grifers 45 times.
It's just a coincidence.
Aye.
They do exist, you know.
:P
I aquired DoW II not to long ago
no expansions though
and now mods yet
dotmahv
One trick pony is also an epic song O.o
(which seems to be an important aspect to finding patterns. :P)
I just wish they made expansions free.
Probably.
Occasionally, I think.
xD
is the stream down?
Have some Metroid Music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za05W9gtegc&feature=g-u-u
plot maker for too many pinkies
you know
G'night all.
i dont pay attention that much tbh :3
but really, would MLP:FiM fit in with the Lifetime network?
it's good but i want MA Larson
It's all about time best episode i think
ATC request to draw or animate?
Could you draw a Tank (RD's tortoise) with a cane, monocle, and bow? :3
REQUEST: Applejack!

#derpy_hooves is busted
/me made out with Z
/me is fun to use :3
/me uses undo spray
It does. But if it's controversial you don't have to do it
Well the furrie community was ruined thanks to CSI, right?
11,01Didn't think we watched a movie with racers.
how did CSI ruin them>
If you know Cybersix, that's how I imagine Human!Mare Do Well
08,01and Vanity Fair
Look it's SerenaMidori's picture: tmblr.co/ZfOqpvXVExi1
Dont you remember the furry based episode, that made them look like all they wanted to do was get into their suits and yiff.
08,01most furries are awesome
Saturn: hmmmmmm
play 20 questions
Therefore, really looking within any group and comparing members to members is a really... very old has-been-done thing.
we used to do that earlier
/me is yiff.
Minority usually screams the loudest
something something something
/me smokes yiff.
08,01Vivix: aye; empty vessels make th emost noise

Rex Mundi, that episode was before Chewfox.
Yeeears before.
yiff is some fucked up shit
do it!
08,01jelonheoh: how?
But there were some great fursuits in that episode XD the 'roo was cute, with the ski goggles.
ya.
if you knew the things ive seen *Proccedes to cry in corner*
08,01personally, i have nothing against yiff or clop, and don't see how either is a bad thing
Are disk one shots?
There are some really good fursuits out there, of course the best ones aren't really made for lovin'
6_9
nice, my father's a vet
In moderation, it is a healthy expression of curiousity and sexuality
/me storms out theaterr in un intellagable rage
/me is not a furry, but accepts them and yiff.
most likely
FiK brown branch
the downside of being a vet is that you become allergic to all the animals you treat after prolonged exposure
Hello :/
/me doesnt think furries are that bad
/me sighs, old talk is old ____--____
I read a book with a character named Filomena and I "wat'-ed hard
adventure music is adventurey
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Saturday Merchandise: "So Much Merch" Edition
The suits themselves though, can be really awesome, but stupid expensive.
/me boobs

The really goods are crazy expensive- but like- movie quality
Any idea how to make a pony name?
/me 08,01bums
Saturn: you are a bum :P
trallite sprinkle
And there was another character named Appolonia which could totally be a relative of Applejack
...
08,01otakon: i'll bum you.
Saturn: NO!
the only time I really "wat"-ed hard was when Twilight said she has a brother. xD
I can't think of anything good though.
Although, I can't say much. I've spent $1500 on a halloween costume.
/me cringes
Zis yiff.
08,01yiff is gak.

08,01Vordox: because my favourite kind of moths are Saturniid moths
Thank you Saturn
Theory: Most male ponies are pegusi
Mine are Polythemus
08,01Nyra: i've reared Polyphemus moths
08,01they are Saturniids
Saturn: Got to say, that's kinda creepy. :P
That's hard to do with English.
Really?
If you get Illustrator, it's worth it to vector
f**k the police
08,01i looooove moths

Cool. I only found the Polyphemus on my doorstep. And I foolishly named her Poly.

"Is it all a joke to you"~JonTron
I've read the rules over twice, can't remember them.
Maybe it was more of a skimming, though.
13That's no excuse.
slipknot ftw :I
Although, chats are generally all following the same guidelines.
No.
Nah some have different standards
tbh i dont remember no rape jokes being in the rules, i even remember saying that if its bannable then it should be
oh boy
No spoiling in this one for example
i didnt read the rules for months.
OMG, you are actually making animations?
Never said that.

shit's nasty man
OK, i come back and now the topic is rape jokes?
then you get ants
13Did you seriously just suggest that rape is not wrong?
and ants are nasty little buggers
Depends on the situation.
Hi Tsitra
I must've missed that sent...pfffffffffft.
13No it doesn't.
Yeah it does.
i believe he meant that the jokes arent wrong
Depends, what's an orderl.
but seriously, why is it not in the rules yet if its bannable
i messed up...orderly*
Hmm?
wat.
wat is happen now
Actually
13Not going to bother.
I don't get that fiddler on the roof joke
Rape doesn't necessarily mean you're hurting them, it just means you're doing it without consent.
