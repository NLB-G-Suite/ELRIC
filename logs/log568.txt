yay
11,01Ponies!
Yay!
Axel Fluttershy
oni_link|mobile: I should not be allowed to make an episode
Aw snap!!
PONIES SYNTH
/me yay
/me synths
aya
what did I miss?
00,10Kandarihu, the guy that did some pinkie one ages ago got a job at studio B
WHAT DID I MISS!?
Sumica: WHAT WAS THAT!?
TheHoodyNinja: Clop, huh?
Iw as gone!
...It's kind of sad that this next video's existence does not surprise me whatsoever.
Oh really? Okay
/me takes TheHoodyNinja and Nittany_Discord together to make a double steroed dual Synth
/me synths
Is that rabiesbun ? i don't remember
We should create a self aware synthesizer to manage and rule the human race. It could be our man made god.
nice! :D
otakon: we shipped you with everything as usual
/me 11,01plays Vordox
Sumica: please tell me what that last thing was?
lmao... I see this is going to be like HISHE for Terminator..
/me Syaynths
:3
Hoo Huu Hyyy Hyyh Heeee hyyy hooooo
Well, It's been a blast. Bye everypony.
otakon: You missed acid-trip dubstep ponies. So nothing out of the ordinary.
too much yay
i think he said it was "want it need it"
bye ZappyTheUnicorn
Night ZappyTheUnicorn
and then another hehehe
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY
00,10otakon, Wantit, need it
Sumica: The Pinkie one as in the Pinkie get a present one?
FairysHuff|Dizzy, but we'd no longer be free if we're being ruled by a machine.
00,10aye Tovler
See ya'll later.
Sumica: danke!
Bye ZappyTheUnicorn
TheHoodyNinja: okay, youre the exception
bye to the ones that are leaving
Sumica: neat
oni_link|mobile: At least not in the same context as the current episodes, twould not be a slice of life show anymore
wub wub~
Kandarihu Better than being ruled by a corrupt elite class of super rich politicians and business leaders like now. I'd prefer the machine. Atleast then the decisions would be logical rather than greed driven
Sumica wasnt the pinkie gets a present one m ade by the head guy on the fan episode
00,10could be Spectrum_Rush|Awake
TheHoodyNinja: so what would be different if you did?
incoming shitstorm?
Tovler: Grab an umbrella.
Guys, I think he's referring to "Cupcakes" by MisterDavie
hmmm looks nice
Oh I saw this
SFM, I still need to figure out how to use it
Can't tell if GMOD or SFM...
HAHA you found the one I linked to you Mica. :D
FairysHuff|Dizzy, but you'd no longer be free to do what you want. If the machine decides that adults shouldn't be watching MLP, would you accept that?
Raise the shields, Lt. Worf
lol
Eddmario: SFM
and now its not very gorgious
DAt face :D
hahah
:D
o_O <- rarity
that map
MEDIC
I'm guessing this is SFM. It's a little too smoothly animated for Gmod.
Kandarihu We're not free now! O_o
Yes its SFM
:3
O_o
lol
suddenly Gary's Mod
Much better than GMod
they need Source Filmake
Still, the cops would be robots, just like in … Star Trek 2009
Rarity is not amused - :D
Hahaha....
a lot better than GMod animation
and INTERMISSION!
intermission on tuesday?
/me rises and stretches
Tovler: Our warp engines have been disabled theirs a whole breach on decks 3 through 7 one of the torpedo launchers is offline and the kettle's no longer boiling.
Dammit Derpy, get out of that popcorn!
We do have freedom. We're not using it very well, but we have it. We ought to be using our freedom while we still have it.
Meanwhile: NOT THE KETTLE!
well that was a nice SFM video
otakon: IKR!
otakon: derpy is the popcorn
wait, intermisson on a Tuesday? ....... DOES NOT COMPUTE! *Explodes.... twice*
Meanwhile: Sheeeeeeeeiit
but what about the Earl Grey man, WHAT ABOUT THE EARL GREY!?
/me takes up Derpy and puts her in my lap and continues to eat Popcorn and helping Derpy eat some too.
Someone should make a vid for BronyState's intermission using SFM
So much smoother than the Gmod videos. I can't wait to see what people do with this.
Ok next up is another Bourne movie. I have seen them and didn't like them so I shall be skipping that one. I go play steam sale games now. *Hugs everypony*
shizuka might be doing that, Eddmario
bye FairysHuff|Dizzy
See ya FairysHuff|Dizzy
FairysHuff|Dizzy: have fun, we shall ping you often. :3c
Goodbye FairysHuff|Dizzy
Sumica Thankyou for the 80s flashback. So many memories ^_^
Reikim, I've seen some decently smooth animation on GMod. I'll bet it was a pain in the butt to make, though.
http://soundcloud.com/samgorski Go to bottom and listen to "Fus Rock"
Ikr, should be fantastic stuff in a couple weeks or so.
so yeah Sumica just check it is the same guy
Bye bee

13pffffffffhahahaha
Sumica: Then why is a truck full of cows right next to you?
13we don't plan anything
Sumica: makes sense...radda radda.
Shizuka!
that line comes to mind when i think about what will be done
hey Shizu
What is this /plan/ you speak of
Planning is for sissies.
/me hugs Shizuka "Hello dear, how are you?:
Ohi Shizuka
00,10ok well we plan to plan
Pfft.
How was the season premiere of Leverage? I missed it
Sumica: planning to plan....okay.
The brave charge ahead, guns blazing.
plannedception
and then institue emergencies when plan fails
ESPECIALLY in stealth missions.
We need a plan for a plan for that exact plan were planning
CK|Catnap: and quickly get buried by the prudent
Harry Pothead and the Philosophers Stoned.
00,10I HAVE A GODDAMN PLAN!
Darf14, set up a planning meeting for that
YES!
I'll be back! need fud
Intermission??????? What's the other trilogy?
THE GODDAMN PLAN!
Darf14: you should make a plan for that O.O
Darf14: We need to plan planner...
Sumica: http://i.imgur.com/3HZ6m.jpg
Bourne.. Supremecy tonight
otakon: Unless, of course, they run out of prunes.
*starts making a plan for the plan meeting*
I'm bored, but I should write, so I'll let Regulars decide what I write. I currently have on board: 1) A TTGL fic that's been dead for almost a year now, 2) an MLP involving an Earth Pony RD in a Steampunk setting, c) Wrek's Doom/MLP crossover, d) an artsy character analysis of RD e) a fic involving an elderly AJ f) a multi-chapter fic involving Trixie's son and g) a Touhou crack shipping fic set in a vaguely film-noir e
plan doesn't sound like a word anymore
otakon: And prudes.
Dark92Enigma: eeyup man, it's Beverly Hills Cop and Bourne this week and next is...the holiest of holies....the most awesome of trilogies
I think that about covers it?
STAR WARS!
Meanwhile: put your imgur away theres people that like that chance here
No wait, I forgot the one involving Fluttershy and Chrysalis. That's h.
H.
otakon YES! YES! YES! Good to know i'm not missing it!
Is the untouched Laserdisk of Star Wars?
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: Nein, I must be the imgur pony.
Is that serious or were you planning to mess with me?
Dark92Enigma: eeyup :)
brb
I almost typed Laserdick
My brother and his friends did this a couple of months ago: http://cheezburger.com/6070650112
wait
Is Shizu gonna rifftrax this Bourne later, too? :D
i love how you jump from 1,2,c
otakon: they are streaming. han only one to shoot star wars?
13nope
Drat. D:

CK|Catnap: Nope
Well, does you has other riffs for us then? :o
Meanwhile: fine but!, i get the right s to draw imgur pony you
Curses, foiled by the separation of the alphabet and the number continuum.
bye everypony
Eddmario: By any chance in Lafayette Louisana?
13i has many riffs
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: Alright then.
I thought we're not supposed to know what each trilogy is going to be until after the lottery.
Many? :D
otakon: are they streaming the original star wars? the untouched ones?
Good thing too. Bourne and Casino Royale were terrible Rifftrax
13but i have been working hard on intermission 2.0
FUS_RO_yay: Me or my brother?
Coming in at a very low 4, or D...
Ah, okay. No worries. ^_^
shizu, now with more railings?
Shizuka: yayness
Shizuka: Got a preview?
Eddmario: I mean where that picture was drawn.

Did I miss the Rifftrax Transformers Trilogy?
13no preview yet, next render will be final i hope
FUS_RO_yay: Nope, DeKalb, Illinois
13haven't done bayformers riffs yet
13and i only have 1 and 2 of that
Eddmario: Ah. Oh well, nvm then.
season 3 contains ponies
> in restaurant, listening to Death, iming fellow bronies like a bowss
RD either way then.
Good. Because Transformers 3's Rifftrax… yeah, it's funny.
Meanwhile, call it Heads or Tails
Eddmario, there's a technical difficulties video. And a single Railings one.
Shizuka: I never got the hate for Micheal Bay's version of the Transformers movies. I liked them.
I have to go cya all later :)
heads.
Flipped an actual coin for it.
Trix wins, pulling out mah Steampunk hat.
Yes, I flipped a real coin.
bye Darf14
AFAIK, the first Bayformers movie was somewhat well received. The sequels were disasters.
Oh I thought you wanted me to flip a coin for it.
At least that Transformers movie went to FIM
bye Darf14! take care
So I did.
Nah, I had the coin.
Ugh, my left shoulder is sunburned from yesterday, and it's starting to hurt again.
What did you get?
Heads, I told you. :P
Nighty bronystate
Night Jim.
Freaky Fred.
O.O
The first movie was a pleasant surprise, like a well-spoken black man. 2nd one was painful. The 3rd one was vexing and not in a good way.
Shizuka: need any pics for those, cause by Celestia I will draw something if needed
OH GOD!
Dat face
I was thinking of it like a sports throw =.= Anyway, you called heads, I flipped tails, thuse TheGreatAndPowerfulT wins. Steampunk time for me.
Night Jim

Meanwhile STOP YELLING AT OTAKON
00,02FUS_RO_yay, its the way you asked, made it seem like a complaint
otakon, whats rule number 2?

Night COuntDoofus
"You're BOURNING up." dohoho
night CountDoofus sleep well man.

Shizu: Well when you're on a budget....

Sumica: thanks for the movie earlier
therainbowvortex: Alicorn
Or perhaps the Temple of Sudden Bee-Near-The-Face.
therainbowvortex: Alicorn, duh
^
You're both wrong.
therainbowvortex, the official term is Winged Unicorn. Alicorn is only the fan term
She's a troll.

Sillies.

Shizuka: YAY!
Shizu: Wouldn't hold your breath.

When's Silverscreen coming back?
Unigas
Kandarihu: no idea sadly, he's still on vaca I believe

Unigas, a singular version of Giygas
dat mumbling. I wish they'd do that thing with the sound where the people mumble but they sound really loud and bass-ey.
11,01Survey 3, I gouged my eyes out. Unable to work.
Now that, that looks like a Temple of Uncertain Danger.
Princii, more than one Princess

Temple of Insane Staircases
00,10make sure you ping me when Shizuka

Have you ever seen how steep that staircase is up close? The ancient Mayans were crazy fit just from walking up and down those things.

They knocked big rubber balls through hoops like twelve feet in the air with their hips. I don't want to think about fit they were.

Very very dead.

Get some men in there, but why no women /socialjustice
This is survey 2, I see dark. Lots and lots of dark. Over.

11,01They must have filmed this in a jet stream.
oni_link: You miss spelles Ponies47 silly :P
well more of a chuckle really
Hi otakon
00,10they own a moped shop why is he running.
Sumica: even in a diffrent universe that dude cant catch a break...
You know they tried to do that, but ironically the Run Lola Run folks wouldn't let them.
13Spectrum_Rush|Awake: just about... probably won't be so bad with a small screen, but i know big screen it was seriously disorienting
*spelled
Sumica: excercise duh
Shaky cam GO!
Survey 10, HEY GUYS, LOOK AT WHAT I CAN DO! LOLOLOLOLOL, YA SEIN' THIS?
Goddamn shaky cams
Mayan volleyball: the most hardcore sport since martial arts.
00,10he will get plenty of that later in the movie he should save his energy
thanks Shizuka :)
13survey 6, WOMBO COMBO, over
Ponies47: darn it :D how ya doin though?
what is this survey you all are going on about?
Survey 11, MLG leet triple spin no scope noob, over.
Shaky cam: because the audience doesn't NEED to clearly see what's going on.
CK|Catnap: lol
survey 6, can u get me an extra order of fries?
oni_link: Fine. You?
survey 42, there's something wrong with the camera - it's all shaky, over
I wonder what RAWRity would say about this
Shaky Cam, because the cameraman needs his exercise too
You know they cut off the losing teams heads and then had a round with them?
00,10worst shaky cam movie ever to see on the big screen is cloverfield
Survey 10, Hey admin! Wanna hear somethin' funny?
omg that movie
when are we streaming it? :p
11,01Survey 8. Returning from toilet. What is the current situation?
00,10I almost puked at that movie
13oh crap he's being tailed by eomer!
*Most hardcore sport in the history of ever
11,01Shakey cam was on purpose there.
Sumica: they should call it Vomitfield
Sumi: But at least it made sense there, since an amateur was filming it.
that's up to debate
Meanwhile: you get that 1080 hi jump 3 for 1 no scope drop shot :D
Here?
It doesn't make any sense.
13i have cloverfield rifftrax... but it doesn't make it much better...
Rifftrax of Cloverfield?
Ponies47: hungry but my food is next to me, Ill brb
It's trying to make the scene more exciting and it fails so hard. XD
oni_link: k
00,10I give no fucks about setting i want to see the damn movie if I want to experence a movie I will go to a 4d theader
11,01Am I one of the few people that liked Cloverfield?
13there's only so much dudebro you can do before you realize the movie was doing a better job parodying itself
Nitt: I liked it.
Sumica: That one of the ones where you can smell what's on screen? :P
The was they riffed on the yuppy party scene was awesome.
4d, eh?
survey 0, ∞
00,10I liked it just put a god damn steady cam on it
*yuppie*
Aren't all the visuals in Cloverfield represented as someone's camrecorder or cell phone camera?
13ja it's all a camcorder
00,10nah Meanwhile it's the ones where the seats move and shit
Sumi: But you don't NEED to see the film, obviously
Sumica: Ah, that sounds annoying.
Oh fer
"It looks so realistic because its shot so poorly"
13i mean really if you're filming a monster attack, give the camera to someone with steadier hands
Then it's justified. Kind of like Blair Witch Project, right?
00,10at least with seats moveing I might not have goten ill
HOLD THE DAMN THING STILL. I don't need to see you shake it around inside the camera.
Shizuka: But then who's going to say "oh god oh man oh god oh man h man oh man oh god"
*car.
00,10it's the perception of movment with no felt movement that made me sick
I have motion sickness now
Yeah. If you're filiming a monster attack don't take lessons from the guys who filmed Cloverfield
and I DON'T GET MOTION SICK!
If Hud had been in a marching band, the movie would have been shot better.
GODDAMN IT TRANSITIONS!
HOW FAR?
I was in the navy for 14 yers.. I was on baits in bad bad weather .. got sick once..
ENOUGH CHANGING CAMERA ANGLES!
it's not that hard to keep your torso reasonably steady
boats*
....
wow
"180 RULE? WHAT THAT?"
13otakon: there are few shots that last longer than a second
Mom's comment: Indian traffic is HORRIBLE
Hold. The. Camera. Still.
Shizuka: yeah just barely the hell.
/me offers Shizu some ice cream
13i'm more amazed that FMLE is keeping up
FMLE?
Ancient Greek sport of pankration, which was basically wrestling, I believe. You could easily die getting your neck snapped.
13stream
00,10this is like a replay in grantrismo with the camera set to random.
On a related note, famous philosopher Plato was a two-time champion.
13was that like six cuts in a second....
or swome crap
00,10half the time the camera is looking the wrong way
Indian traffic looked awesome in The Darjeeling Limited
Oh my god.
This is so bad. ._.
dis guy is wrek!
00,10must have been a bitch to film this
i like the camera work, i honestly think it's a matter of personal preference
/me note to self, DO NOT jack stream visuals to 47 inch TV, ugh:(
00,10set up 15cameras for 4 seconds of filming
Shake the camera! (like a failsauce)
13editors must have been "you want me to make that how short?"
11,01Chasing a car on foot?
Shaky cam AND Macroblocks?
DED
HEAD SHOT
13well a few of them you can tell is one camera taking a continuous shot, but chopped up
05,15:(
11,01Aaaaaaand dead.
and she's dead
00,10damn was that wrek?
LOLA IS DEAD!
13LOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
GODDAMMIT WHY DIDN'T SHE SCREAM!?
this is just the beginning isnt it?
WHY!?
Sumica: that or me...
Jspang1: yes
If she was running she'd be faster than the car.
hey!! I made the wrek joke already :P
11,01otakon: Headshot.
Guess they decided they didn't want to pay her enough to stay through the whole film
TIME SHIFT!
00,10wrek is better at hiting a movie target then you Shamroc
I'm reminded of Heavy Rain
00,10er moving
TIME SHIFT LOLA TIME SHIFT!
....idiot. She's dead.
13yeah that'll work...
Sumica: oh thanks for the compliment.......you ass haha
movie target? lol
13CPR underwater...
Don't fuck with Plato.
more like a neckshot, but still - instantly fatal
13for a headshot...
He'll wrestle you.
00,10did't say you were bad
00,10just there have been time you have missed me

Sadly I have to leave early due to a family situation. Enjoy the rest of the movie everypony!

otakon, what % is the discount?
And the Derpy figure sells out two minutes after it goes online at the shop. No suprise there
Kandarihu: it's 5 with the discount, it's 10 IIRC
13wow... CIA clearance works that way huh?
00,10Is that merphy brown?
13just get a guy to say "okay"
11,01Treadstone? It's a stone where people tread.

13all the computers instantly know "welp that guy said okay"
00,10big brother is realy advanced Shizuka
00,10it is always listening after all
I got it when it was 75% off iirc. You should wait and see if that happens again
And the Romans got bored in between wars, and started filling giant arenas with water, putting boats inside, and having miniature naval battles.
Shizu: Their computers are good listeners.
Survey 9, mom's ragequitting at the slander
AMNESIA?!?
Yeah, that's an awesome idea.
My God. Treadstone created The Dark Descent

GODDAMMIT STOP CUTTING SO MUCH CAMERA!
uh
Dungeon Defender is 75% off again. And this time, it's ALL 75% off. Even all of the DLC
Sumica: buttock
Before, only some of the DLC was on discount and there was no complete collection deal.
00,10"You were a little hard on the beaver last night Ward."
So I think I'm gonna get that.
ok, this is getting really annoying. what the fuck is wrong with fimfiction and why does it keep crashing?
Dat chin dent.
Kandarihu: so the WHOLE thing so far for what? 3 bucks?
Joker happened!
duh fuck kinda sexual phrase is that?
Jspang1: probably attacked again
which sucks
Aside from the whole "dying" part, yeah.
Not downhill.
but it's happened before
SIDEWAYS.
I'm not sure and I can't check. Mom's back.
otakon: well that sucks
He's only one year from retirement.
Japan is Awesome!
Nothing goes downhill in Congress. Only sideways.
Con is the opposite of Pro
$12.49
pro is the opposite of con, therefore progress is the opposite of congress
ok ya got that one Sumica but, what were the first words sain on television?
And to cons make a pro.
*said
Heil Hitler :(
11,01Alert! It's automated!
Ponies47: a wild oni_link has appeared, what will you do?
Hmm, that's well more than half of the rest of my budget.
ponibas: o.o
Ah, so they're finally explaining the plot.
Turns out he ded.
took long enough
oni_link, someone asked what first words that were said on tv were.. I od't exactly know.. but I know first televised event was a pseech by Hitler
Only took 30 minutes, that's not too bad.
damn 760,000...nice
holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiii......
hell, wish I had 7,600 dollar
that voice sounds familiar
also wow, first time in years i have tuned in to see the simpsons in years. holy crap.
13the owls are startled
thats still on?
I like owls.
That sounds like a dumb theory, detective.
oni_link, is it still centering heavily around Homer?
But I suppose that's the best you can do with absolutely no evidence.
ponibas: eeyup :)
i think this is a moe episode though :O
00,10Spectrum_Rush|Awake, hitlers speech
13WILL SOMEONE SHOOT THOSE OWLS
XD
who?
poker face
13oh he's dead
And Damon's like "....this is my bland face. I'm acting. :|"
ponibas: the bartender :o
Stop startin' on the owls Shizu.
Wow, this movie is a LOT shorter than the first one.
and he is dead
so very dead
Dumbass.
13otakon: it's a little shorter
Sumica: nice guess but no, It was "Good evening and welcome to television."
lol, no noy you.. I know who Moe is.. I was saying who about the owl comment.. cuz thats what owls say
13but they're both around 2 hours
Fightscene, what fightscene?
00,10ahh
Did you seriously just get told that this guy is a priority target, and then pull a gun on him AT CLOSE RANGE?!?
00,10perhaps I was thinking of radio
Shizuka: this one is only 1h47m the first was 2h6m or so
1310 minutes isn't that much shorter
that's a episode of ponies difference
so should i do old world blues or the lonesome road first in fallout new vegas?
So 19 minutes shorter
13besides, blame it on the fast cuts :3
Quick question. Can anyone recommend me Stronghold 3 if anyone here has it?
Blame it on the boogy.
Is that the new FTP on Steam?
Dovah: do Old World Blues first, save Dead Money for last and Lonesome Road after OWB
dat Siemens
Shizuka: dem cuts...they BURN!
Nope. It's on sale now.
/me peers around, liking this quietness in the chat. :)
My god that IS Murphy Brown
Never heard of it.
otakon: already did dead money it was painful
she busted those balls like a boss
If it's the free to play one, I have a friend who tried very hard to get me to play it.
13ja she put that guy in his place hard
I thought Murphy Brown had a huskier voice
Dovah: and that's why you save it for last, when you're most powerful and talented
Nope. Aw, well. Thanks anyway.
One year retirement guy got told.
I remember it being f2p but a pain in the ass unless you paid for the game to take care of your stronghold while you're away.
Tovler: well she does but that women is channeling her HARD.
I decided I just couldn't handle an RTS.
otakon: pffft i got the gold
Stop cutting from one cam to another, damnit.
13he's going to visit vivi~
Dovah: ALL of it?
You don't NEED to here.
13she will know what to do
otakon: yes
Shizuka: yay! wish I could visit Vi...
stop startin
Remix the recording.
11,01Honk. Hooooooooooooooooooooook.
ponibas: start stopin

13hey look, he stopped startin
Shizu: She'll blast the agents away with her remix cannon.
otakon: bought every wepon in the game with it still got 8 bars left :)
otakon: stop startin
Dovah: nice man, how did you do it?
yer mums a slag
How does a "remix" cannon work, you ask? YOU'RE NOT AUTHORIZED TO KNOW.
Dovah: if tl;dr don't worry about it.
CK|Catnap: what about the bass cannon?
tl;dr?
/me looks for a Futurama "telephone" booth
Dovah: means too long ; didnt read
otakon: Vi doesn't need it. Remix cannon is way more powerful.
CK|Catnap: but...BASS CANNON!
Who is that.
whos who?
Dunno but she looks ....familiar.
Meanwhile, some chick

I really don't like cab anyways
Please take my cab, asshole

Barbetos: i want that bat
/me gags
Another country another set of cops.
I said it before and I'll say it again. The only that's going to stop Season 4 is an EMP attack
HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY DAMNIT.
the russians build cars that look that old
oni_link echo communicate that you want to be friends.
It's a certain way of filming dammit, it's good camera work and is really, really hard to do (takes a lot more time as well) ;(
I like it.
Barbetos: I dont know how

05,15CENTIPEDE ON MY WALL
05,15OH GOD
OMG
No, it's a shitty way of filming that makes the action harder to see.
Eat it. :D
KILL IT
13ready i know how we can all get smashed right now
KILL IT
fluttercry: Quick! Eat it!
13every time the shot changes
You don't like it, doesn't mean it's bad.
13take a shot
fluttercry: KILL IT WITH FIRE! BURN DOWN YOUR WHOLE HOUSE IF NECESSARY
just dont use that type of camera work during a talking scene its annoying
personal preferences and all
Prick is now on iBronyradio, they have noticed the Lovable Prick and they know how much they Love me
fluttercry: atleast its not human
The idea is to add "excitement", what it does is make things harder to identify.
Shizuka: i only have two bottles of liquor
Shizuka: im already drunk.....SO MANY SHOT CHANGES
I can identify everything perfectly.
derpy_pony2: :D
Narolas: It's an action movie crutch. :p
11,01fluttercry: Eat it.
aww, now you start the drinking game :( Im all out of whiskey
And it's garbage.
Personal prefenrences, again.
Shizuka: I wish I could but I have school tomorrow night and I'm underage
05,15My Medieval Total War manuel killed it.
13if this were just cause 2 the car would have exploded by now
CRASH ALL THE THINGS
You can dislike it, it's fine. Don't confuse your opinion with facts
05,15Shizuka and someone would be tethered to the back of it.
I Would Probably kill my self with that many shots
spy is sappin my chat
Shizuka: Sounds awesome ^.^
SPAH
Narolas: I think you have it backwards.
darn chat
CK|Catnap: How so ?
wroaaaarrrr *sizzles*
11,01Was that shock noise necessary?
And then Gary Numan came on the radio
HERE IN MY CAR
I FEEL SAFEST OF ALL
StinkomanFan|BDay: :D
i can lock all my doors
and its the only way in
in cars
13and smash into walls
13in
13cars
Narolas: You're using your own personal preferences as a counterargument to my claims that shaky cam is a pointless mechanic meant to add more "excitement" to a scene that is already plenty exciting without it.
11,01CARS!
13*dun dun*
oh
my
And then he's hit by a lorry.
THE END
Hes Dead :o
Dude, who chopped onions on that guys head.
13everyone else is like "eh, normal day on the russian freeway"
14 more minutes
Shizuka: Damn ninja >.<
shizu were gonna get a riff of this later?
13cratorkid: ikr, we've had like five climaxes by now
Meanwhile: i dont know *hides knife and onion skins*
13Shamroc: i wish, but they didn't do 2 or 3
aww
13look the smoothest shots all movie
CK|Catnap: Thing is, i think it's too shaky for my own taste, but it doesn't mean it's bad.
See? These shots are fine, they're tense and enjoyable. Would these shots be better if I rattled the camcorder around some more? No. That's the point I'm making: if they held the damn thing still, the film would still be exciting, and easier to watch to boot. :P
Shizuka: wow. is still a bit shaky :D
wait, was that girl in Spiderman 3?
are we complaining about shaking cameras?
Shizuka: since there's no riff of this, why not a random Riff? entirely up to you ofcourse
13i have something better
Wait, who is this again?
Shaking cameras are good in horror movies
13neski's daughter i think?
13the guy he killed in the flashback
/me wonders what Shizuka has in store
Ah.
CK|Catnap: Daughter of guy that he wasted in Berlin
05,15better than rifftrax? MST3K?
Stranger Danger!
Was gonna say, I was starting to get lost there. XD
Hai everypony. :3
They gave the camera to a siezure victim
lol
Pudge: hello
Hai Pudge
hiz
Hi Pudge :3
Bourne Identity?
duuunnnnnn
Stinko: Actually it reminds me more of a little kid given a camera for the first time.
Oh yeah I'm sure that'll do a much better job for her life.
and I missed most of it.
Oh btw, your parents didn't commit suicide, I killed them. I killed them a lot.
13see, if he weren't an emotionless psychopath, he would reach out and take her hand right now
90 minutes of it Pudge.
"It was my first time....it wasn't very good."
DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT MY FATHER
MY FATHER WAS A SAINT
O.O
CK|Catnap: HA!
13StinkomanFan|BDay: HE TOLD ME YOU KILLED HIM
05,15No I AM YOUR FATHER
Just To Let You Know I Killed Your Parents Want To Be BFFs?
13something
NO LUKE, I AM YOUR FATHER
13blah..
StaticCloud: :D
Why the hell would she want to know that you murdered her parents in cold blood?
walks away
Shizuka: Hug someone as you're telling them you killed their parents ? Are you seriously ?
what're we watching?
CK|Catnap: To get their murders off his back?
Now she can become the BATWOMAN!
Now she's just more traumatized because you opened old wounds, you jackass.
13CK|Catnap: ja at least come back after the events of the next movie when you know WHY they were your target
Anyways, sorry, i didn't want to start an agrument over this, but people have a tend to be quick to judge when a lot has to do to preferences. This is good camera work, it took time, planning, preperation, and it made to conveys certain emotions. Just because it doesn't touch YOU, doesn't mean it failed, or is badly done. That sortof thing makes me a bit angry ;(
Oh yeah, and i killed your parents, sorry.
We should stream Catwoman
hmm sorry luke where going to need to do some blood tests we dont know who the hell your father is now
dat wall
13Alister: was the only emotion he showed all movie but his body language was showing deep regret
jesus, spelling errors

05,15Does this one have Moby on the credits? I forgot
13yup

Narolas: well I poke fun at it but it works. youre right

And I am your father
11,01"Will you leave us alone?" "No." "Why?" "Because we have to make another movie."

Damnit you stalker
And then moby comes in and makes everything awesome

She's probably creeped out that you keep following her
Narolas: Its alright :)
dittany?
dittany niscord
what is this song called?
11,01cowvarkian: I guess.
After she told him his real name why does she go back to calling him Bourne ?
Nittany: "We haven't made enough money on this thing yet. Got to juice it for all it's worth."
SEE YA GUYS
brb, gonna make some mac and cheese maybe >.>
TrixieMuffin: Because aliens wear hats.

I didn't watch most of it
This trilogy is very nice in my opinion
why was there a darn colon there ...gahhh
seemed weaker than the first
05,15It is
11,01I will BRB. Updating desktop.
05,15the 3rd one is really good though
11,01Laptop
Yup, the third one was good though
11,01Desktop is broken.
I didn't actually get to pay attention to any of it, so I still need to find time to actually watch it.
K Nitt :P
hi
Hi PonyPonyPony
hi
00,03Just in time... to miss it :(
Good thing i've watched it before though
hi PonyPonyPony
im not aware there was a third bourne movie , whats it called ? the bourne omnipotency ?
13i have a special treat for you next
Narolas: Thing is, though, it's not doing its job if it doesn't "touch" the audience. Movies are not supposed to work for a single type of person, they're supposed to bring their audience into the movie with them. Immersion and all that. I don't mind shaky cam where appropriate, and provided it's done well. Here, it's not, not as well as other films I've seen using the effect.
/me puts on headphones
Scoot-Scootaloo: yup
Scoot-Scootaloo: what sthat 2 days in a row now
00,03Is it Ponies?
Shizuka: A new banned video?
Is it more Rifftrax?
Because i was mostly thinking about -stone puns during that stream:D
lol
05,15A talking Llama that wears hats?
did you get me a pony?
all of the above?
CK|Catnap: Do you know the succes those movie had and still have ? it touched a lot of people, just not you.

You have the whole first episode of Season 3 already?
05,15Carl there's a dead human in our house!
CK|Catnap: I half-agree with you.
Narolas: Twilight. :p

I request ponies
I Can See The Blood Traiiil
oh god what?
I SECOND THE REQUEST FOR PONIES!
Narolas: yeah, the whole "100000 flies can't be wrong" argument don't work too well
ponies r everything
00,03And ewww ponies :|
also YT is bucking up again
Major: exactly :D
Ponies
Incidentally that's my counterargument to any "appeal to popularity" argument. :P
Flootahshy: you NEVER ask for ponies
Major: http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/halolz-dot-com-steamsummersale-holdwallets.jpg
EVER
CK|Catnap: I don't think the bourne trilogy had mixed reviews, and a two sided response with love vs hate like twilight did.
00,03Totalynotsumica: Any reason why you have that nick?
SirGanjalf: Bwahahahaha! :D
otakon: why not?
Scoot-Scootaloo: that's as not sumica as you can possibly be
he's at his unsumicaest
Flootahshy: oh you'll see
YOU WILL SEE!
YOU HAVE CALLED DOWN THE THUNDA!
because it's MLG
>.>
It's MLG Pro
otakon: Oh! I LOVE thunda!
CK|Catnap: Also it's a silly example, if you start talking about how it touches people, don't go against it's popularity the second after :/
yay
/me wonders how long he has been gone
always so exciting.
Flootahshy: suit yourself
anyway, YT is borking again
can i have a cupcake
can't post 'Reply' on the comments now
brb need a drink
Narolas: No, it's a perfectly good example. You made the point that a movie's popularity is a judge of its quality, yet there are clearly counterarguments to that point.
Narolas: Except you're using its popularity as the basis for it being objectively "good" which is completely separate.
again otakon?
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-derpy-as-mayor.jpg
13now i need to warn you, what i am about to show you is not yet complete, and hasn't been rendered out yet, so the quality will be fairly low
very blue
Narolas: What I was saying is that the film is a good film, but the shaky cam is a significant detraction from it.
Hell, if we're going simply by financial success, shouldn't Avatar be the undisputed "Best" movie ever?
/me is excited

RAWRity: It seems really awful because you know how it's gonna play out. But overall, it's mediocre.
Good times, good times.
CK|Catnap: yes, but it's certainly not the best film ever be it in story telling OR direction.
RAWRity: Oh definitely not.
13few moments
RAWRity: what in bloody hell are we arguing about?

Shizuka: no worries
the whole third row is clocks

13you will recall from the other preview there will be a countdown in the lower right
/me Dances
Dat rarity
*of course it isnt that is
I AM ENJOYING THE INTERMISSION
(\
/me shuffles
*sigh* This is going nowhere, because there is absolutely no real definition of quality in art, if you talk about the way it touches people then you can't say populatiry means nothing.
Ah, so are you trying to add in the graphics now Shizuka?
Wait...
dat simcity ost
HA!
05,15I'm liking this a lot
This Intermission looks...
00,03What you did there.. i see it~
Different
Ooh, preview. It's pretty.
13some bits will be choppy, that's vegas falling behind
neat
dat face
OMG THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE INTERMISSION!!!
quick tiwlight, grab my body....adventure!!!
13all transitions are the same, so when it fails that's just vegas derp
alright! Lvl 55 Manetric. Now to beef up my other pokes so I can challenge the E4
13most of these are massive vector images it's scaling
wait, not being sumica is now a kickable offence?
HatchetRyda: Twilight, grab my wingboner... INTERMISSION!
Oh man...now I'm just remembering everything I saw about the new SimCity game and I want it to come out now! XD
BACK FOR NOW
Lovin' the music
Twi is like dat plot
My favourite part of Intermission is Intermission
Vordox: that works too lol
/me is not sumica
05,15owloysius yup. Everyone is banned but Sumica
00,10no but it should be owloysius
OtakuTom: I hope EA doesn't destroy it
let the countdown, BEGIN.
dats a nice intermission :3
ima back :D
damn. I don't know how to be sumica. Maybe i'll start by kidnapping a mod.
You know...
Shizuka: I could make an EXE of this... >.>
sounds good owloysius
then i'll get the right text colour
this is a cool intermission, i approve
05,15Oh Derpy
silly derpy
Ah no wait, gradience transparency doesn't work, damn
Narolas: Thing is, there *are* objective measures of artistic quality. Else there wouldn't be a purpose in rating them. :p
Have you seen any of the trailers for it, WalkerPony89? It looks pretty good.
She just dont know who took it lol
Silly Derpy :P

The stream's derping for me, but will the classic Derpy in the popcorn bag image from the old intermission show up at one point during the new one?
"Insert additional Quote here with meaning"
/me nominates unfinished slide for Slide of the Year.
Cypresswolf: screw logic, shes pinkie pie
CK|Catnap: Maybe, but the only clear ones are technical, and technically this camera work has been carefully planned and made, whether it touches you or not has nothing to do with it's quality.
:#
13watch this :3
"TEXT"
:3
"Insert a Quote, and optionally a Curly Brace."
05,15LOL
:D

Quote more text.
So, what's next then?
Awww yeaaah
13aaaaand
dat cardboard twi in the back
13prepare your ears
CK|Catnap: Outside of technical ones, you're never gonna have a clear one, period. Everyone has a different way to describe what good art is, because their very definition of art is different.
Which text are we quoting?
QUOTE TEXT
oo
dat quote text
Scoot-Scootaloo: twilight dont hurt me...dont hurt me...no more lol
I see a whole new system wars brewing. But instead of being between Nintendo Sega Sony and Microsoft, it's between Valve and EA
Meanwhile: we nead that pic of yours
Narolas: But you can measure it against other films of similar nature. And if you do, you'd quickly find that the camera work is indeed shoddy in this film by comparison to the effect they were trying to achieve.
05,15DAT TRANSITION!
Love that transition

Erm...

My ear had an eargasm there, it was nice...

That was pretty cool
mmmmm that transition :3
song is so smooth i'm sliding out my chair
IN-TER-MISSION.
CK|Catnap: Can you measure that ? the way it touches people and conveyed emotions ? not really.
:B
Narolas: ah, but do these films really qualify as "Art"? I'd class them as entertainment far before I approached the realm of art.
Meanwhile: it buffered for me
Twi is best pony :3
05,15So...that's where gondor was?
Spectrum_Rush|Awake: Buuuuffering. Is in here.
/me Slides out chair
Did Pinkie pie capture Minas Tirith?!?!?!?
In a snowglobe?
Narolas: actually, you can. Very easily in fact.
OUCH!
dat song transition
mmmmm that buffering transition......still sounds good every 15 seconds LOL
silly fluttercry
funny you mention that...
/me slides out of chair "ITS SO SMOOTH I CANT TAKE IT!"
Little help here! *Holds out hoof*
RAWRity: I'm using art as a general term in this case, easier to use
Meanwhile: no i mean it literally buffered for me and i thought for evrypony elso to
Are we having the art discussion again? That makes, what, three times now?
/me throws rope at Ponies47
8,6good evening everypony :)
Narolas: Yeah, RAWRity's right. And even if you couldn't, it's hardly relevant in regards to the technical quality of the film, which is below average.
Allo kirz.
oh hai kirzstryfe
/me tries to hold DerpinRainbows in their chair but is slipping outta his
Evening kirz.
Odaly
/me noms and Steals kirzstryfe tail.
13now i'm impressed how well this next slide lines up too
Evening, kirzstryfe
Alons-y
:c somepony help me this song is too smooth
One hour left till loss of Internet!
XD
/me parties
....
Hey kirzstryfe :3
oni_link: Thanks
wait its actually buffering for other ppl? i thought it was just my shitty internet?
even kirzstryfe
00,10yay
OH NOES
oh god noooooooooooooooo
Shizuka, I notice that it's saying the resolution is in 501x376. That's only how it's being scaled for the preview, right?
SHOO BE DOO
seaponies!
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo!
who sent the sos
SEA PONIEZ!
/me snuggles Shizuka. XD
00,03AHHH yeah!
Dat slide!
SHOO BE DOO, SHOO SHOO BE DOO
so much shoo bee doo
Calling all the seaponies
I change my vote, THIS is slide of the year
13Kandarihu: ja, it will be 640x480 when done
Narolas: seems it would be easier and mor e accurate to simply say it's entertainment. "Art", in my book, is something that tries to express something intangible in the psyche, or say something about the human condition.
13vegas has a really really hard time keeping up though
00,10it's bacon and applejack
Shizuka: is there one that uses the Smooze at all :3
^
Hello everyone. Hoow are your days so far?
13just wait
QUOTE TEXT, all shall bow down before quote text.
I don't see sea ponies
Patience people :3
/me waits
Ponies47: that river of smoothness came outta nowhere and it aint nothing :$
And let's be fair here, the Bourne series is by no means an artistic piece. They're movies meant to grip your attention for a few hours, give you a story and characters you like, and have some neat action scenes.
00,10get on with it
Introspection is not their goal.
:l
TRANSISTION TIME
/me gets out Spike and gives him Saxophone and sunglasses "Play for me"
Dem muffins
Daaang
05,15oooh this song sounds nice
oni_link: Yes *Ties rope to slef and throws the other end at oni_link*
Darwinia
So much muffins i do say.
Like one of the first games on steam from what I remember
Ponies47: good thing im tied to TOM :D
There Are!
13now it gets choppy
I won't forget to do the image for that slide.
Hell. I think the first game on steam besides that was.. Rag Doll Kung Fu!
Hah.
13vegas hates looping gifs
Man memories
CK|Catnap: I'm gonna stop, this is going a bit too far, and in circle as well. I'll admit that it's not as good as it can be, but my point stays, if it's not touching you, it doesn't mean it's bad. I'm just asking for some balance in judgements.

So nice.

This piano is so insanely relaxing.
AAH OH GOD
Freaky Fred. The words you hear, are in his head.
Freeeed~
o_o
I think for the intermission music, it should be changed to some pony music
I think my heart might just stop.
This room has been...NAAAUGHTY
I've been a Naaaughty boy
don't ask for pony music
Meanwhile: Why thanks. I TOTALLY didn't need sleep
00,10nice zoom Shizuka
05,15Eddmario I think it's just fine the way it is. Not everything has to be ponies.
Bow bow bow bow
you'll get shoo be doo
Pinkie ate too much taffy today
Smoooooooozeeeee
Narolas: Except, like I said before, when it's a technical aspect executed more poorly than another comparative title. Then it's not opinion or feelings, it's describing the nature of the beast. But fair enough. :p
This is going to drive rocky away, with the Freaky Fred reference
WOOT SMooze
Smooze!
Thank Lna nobody ponified that thing from the stone slab episode...
man, this changes the mood so much
*Luna
ALL the smooze.
RAWRity: Agreed, sorry about that, english isn't my first language, so i just had to use a general word to describe something. I never use art anyway because it's doesn't have any real definition and cannot really be used in arguments (or the argument changes to the definition of art :p)
/me bows down to the Smooze
....
Daw!
lol
That's after Requim for a Adream :P
:D
13this slide is not final
So Twi just watched Requiem for a Dream.

Poor Twi, you're my fave! :'3

Shizuka: for the leverage one

Eddmario: dat only 1 ping
otakon: I guess we're pinging you. Ping.

05,15When you were still learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME! I was learning TO CONQUER GALAXIES
OKYA I GET IT
BRICK JOKE COMPLETE
What.
XD
"Where in the world is Gondor"
:D love that
lol
CK|Catnap: Oh well ok, i can admit that it's less good than other movies of it's genre. It's not "horrible" though, as some people were saying (which is what annoyed me in the first place, extreme opinions)
lol
Man that image is ooooooooold.
Is that Helm's Deep? XD
/me Throws a blinket over oni_link
I cant wait for new episodes of mlp
nah, Minas Tirith
Isn't Minas Tirith IN Gondor?
tottaly the shire
/me smies at Ponies47
Well, that explains why no one could find Gordor.
@fluttercry: I was destroying planets and raping their women when you were still in your dad's ball sack
Shizuka: pony trying to get a muffin .gif like that dog
Eddmario: dude, a little much.
/me Smiles back at oni_link :)
Everypony shares and cares, but MUFFINS? Good luck on that.
CK|Catnap: Thank you though, that was an interesting topic. :-)
/me muffles Eddmario and ties his leg like cattle and then sit on his stomache.
Eddmario: annnd took it too far..
Shizuka: this one? picture of Ghost Nappa
Now, listen 'ere pardner, we no take kindly to dem jokes you hear.
Oh man, if there's one thing i HATE about discussing movies, it's the way some people seem to only have 2 opinions on something. It either sucks, or it's fantastic. No middle ground whatsoever.
XD
05,15INDIAN STALLONE!
05,15YES
Hahaha
Indian Stallone is best buffer.
It was the fact that I said "raping", wasn't it?
Iiiironyyyyyy

Indian Stallone?

:)
/me makes cookies for everypony
Eddmario: Pretty obvious.
Eddmario....yeah..
05,15Eddmario it was pretty much that whole thing
The buffer is buffering. Deal w/ it.
no. some of us had family on alderon
AttacktheAndalite: you had to be there
Who wants cookies?? :3
AttacktheAndalite: it was a meme
/me is still disappointed this didn't win Best Meme

I hate when he leaves so fast. :P
I never played Knytt...strangely, parts of this song put me in mind of Iji, specifically the first level.

"Political correctness can go fuck its unconstitutional self" - eddmario
and MOAR QUOTE TEXT
cowvarkian: ? hmm
:P
There, that's a quote you guys can use
Shizuka: we'll find something for ya dear
one does not simply quote oneself.
QUOTE TEXT I WUB YOO
Derpy broke ALL the walls
Railings!
looking good, Shizu :)
Phase4 Its ironic becuase the picture is taken in Forks, Seattle. It is the town in which the novel Twilight takes place. I think it is ironic that there would be a pic of Twlight Sparkle there. XD
cod sarn it! my chat derped
RAWRity: "And Angel puked on a tree the end."
How long is this intermisson anyways? Just wondering :)
20 minutes
cat?

Well, goodnight everypony. I'm liking those late-night, after-movie discussions/arguments, it's always interesting. Bye !
Silly Twilight u pushed AJ
00,02Barbetos, you know far to much about that novel :P
Ponies47: Timer is in the corner. .-.
QUOTE TEXT

RAWRity: That fanfic reminds me of throwing a bag of potato chips against a chain link fence.
...Cat?
Phase4 Read it all twice actually. lol
....and I don't know where that analogy was going.
Meanwhile: It keeps poping in and out silly :P

Shizuka, I found one 1 googolplex light years across, is that sufficient?
I notice that it doesn't go back to the Monty Python Intermission music. Is this in anticipation of technical difficulties or other delays with the lottery?
/me noms on Shizuka

Night Regulars
QUESTION: Who is better, WoodenToaster, MicTheMicrophone, or TheLivingTombstone?
Eddmario: Because of reasons.

DerpinRainbows: Danial Ingram

Eddmario: its not the uk version of bronycon its its own seperate con

here we go again
Shizuka: Indy Ploy all the way
when he has time, of course

Does anybody else have problems connecting to steam right now?
oh....well then somone ping me when it starts or something
1319 slides remain to be filled, 8 need pictures, 11 need quote and pictures
Oink.
If Sumica starts streaming, then we'll be flying by the seat of a poorly built rocket
eddmario: ido as well
13intermission will be 20 minutes long when completed
13since we reroll so often
rockytoppie85, truth is, there's a stream going on any time of day. There are streamers from many different English-speaking countries, and it's always daytime or evening somewhere in the world.
flying into a sun? GabeMoist
is it buffer for anyone else
Wrong. Well built, just poorly concieved.
Tomorrow is now personal image-making day.

Anypony suggest any good Skyrim mods?

Expectoration IS spitting.
oni_link: So have I
CK|Catnap: MLP is NOT ''animesque''. Don't ever say that
RAWRity: um...RD is MUCH less of a ass then Gaston.

No one's a barge like Gaston.
Bob!
AttacktheAndalite: This is delicious :D
How big is a barge?
pretty big
05,15Alister someone asked Lauren Faust if it was at Bronycon and she said no. So yeah. You're right.

If he's so large, why aren't the ladies over him?
a barge is a cargo ship basically.

Crazy old Maurice

fluttercry: Asked her if it was anime, or if it featured anime stylistic choices? >_>
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1197/
oni your laptop is stoned lololol
What are we watching

05,15CK|Catnap anime stylistic choices

rd is best gaston
STRIKE UP THE BAND
ThunderLeo: some PMV's atm.
Gaston has a goddamn plan.
...People look at MLP and get anime?
ugghhh its not working
otakon: I have a right to express my opinions. If I don't , then the fanbase is just forcing a mindset on every fan
I can appreciate the time and effort into ALL PMV's.
FillyFlam: the large eyes and simple bodies
Evolving a Kakunaaaa
Bronysith: WAT
I dunno. The eyes especially seem reminiscent of anime IMO. or at least other western shows that have aped the anime aesthetic.
fluttercry: Oh? Interesting, since it really does have some features of anime. But I suppose they're vague enough that you could slap any label on 'em.
QQ: would it be possible to ponify Hellsing?
Kingman725: I know right? :P
RAWRity: yh, big eyes small mouthes and all that.
otakon: Yeah, but there are plenty of western shows and movies with art styles like that too.
8,6I think someone already has, Dovah
/me noms on kirzstryfe
what are we watchin
FillyFlam: yeah, and Lauren worked on them too
ThunderLeo: random stuff atm
05,15RAWRity The anime eyes were influenced by Disney so...
RAWRity: And dont' forget some of the special effects, like the giant rainbow blast near the end of the season 1 2-part pilot
and MORE Disney PMV
Dance Sumi, dance~
i like random stuff more than movies
o lol
11,01Does anyone take dumps like Gaston?
Hmm...touche.
people have problems if they ponified that... well how bout Berserk?
Prince Alii
Otakon, Powerpuff Girls could be considered "anime-esque" with big eyes small mouths, etc. It's all what people want to see... -_-
fluttercry: So? :P
Nittany_Discord: Nopony does.
Nittany_Discord: Um..no?
dear god how long is this?
Prince Ali is fabulous as he!
dat Robin Williams
Nittany_Discord: Well, he IS a piece of shit...
IS Pinkie
what is this song from?
but yeah, compared to stuff liek Teen Titans, MLP doesn't have much in the way of an animesque style.
Aladdin
fluttercry: If you go back far enough, anything is from something else. :p
Alladin
Abooboo
11,01Eddmario: Lol.
ah yes i think its.... aladdin?
pinkie is best genie?
Yeah, Pinkie is best Genie. Dunno how well RD does at being Ali tho.
spelle how otakon spelle it
oh it is :D
Yes, I am old
RAWRity, totally. :>
wait everybody is at the aladdin song?
Aladdin
Aladdin <3
The difference is fluidity , MLP characters have fluid expressions while anime characters move so stiffly and ,ost of the time only move thier mouths while talking
lol
Dat otakick
already otakon ?
holy crap my internetz is somewhat catching up
pony_4461: Pinkie is best genie
Robin Williams actually sang this, and named his daughter after a Legend of Zelda character.
wait what?
ponibas: already? you missed two earlier this night.
He needs to guest star on MLP.
ponibas: He's gotten kicked twice since I got on tonight
Eddmario: eeyup, it's awesome
maybe, I was playing TF2 for a bit
AttacktheAndalite: three so far tonight.
Zelda Williams is the best
Disney movies have the best music. ^^
Eddmario: not sure if it was just commercial or he really did
Emmie: agreed on most counts.
daring do ftw
05,15I'd believe that he did
00,10Alister not all shows are the same
And Alister that depends on the anime.. i've seen some very fluid ones.. not like One Piece (whcih i can't stand)
oni_link: He actually did. His daughter is actually named Zelda
Eddmario: "A" character? His daughter's named Zelda. That's THE Zelda character :P
oni_link: no her name is Zelda
So, how long til Moulin Rouge can be chosen to be played during the lottery?
Eddmario: my hat off to him :)
Eddmario: never ever ever EVER

rockytoppie85, A skit by Avenue Q
rockytoppie85: Avenue Q a musical.
11,01I'm fairly left.
Ths is Avenue Q
and then what did you do?
YES I DO!
PORN PORN PORN
They have some good characters, lots of interesting backstory to pick and choose from from the comics, a dcent budget and directors that know how to make a good action set piece. But it squanders a lot of that in the name of appeasing DC comics and trying to advertise the New 52
INTERNET ISNT FOR PORN. just like 90% of it
11,01Pirate Party follower here.
Nittany_Discord: I've never heard any debates/arguements about politics. Plenty of arguements/debates about games though
Eddmario: dat ratchet&clank
just look up "Internet is for porn" on youtube
11,01That makes me a traitor already.
and when your parents yell.. do not look at me
Isn't Avenue Q just South Park mixed with Seseme Street?
XD
The internet is for Cookie monster
8,6and since this is supposed to be a happy place, kick the political talk to another channel
11,01Grab your click and double dick for.

"Grab your dick and double click for porn porn porn"
NOOOOOO
PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINKIE PIEEE

The creators said their ideas was to try and make a show that showcased "all the best parts of the DCU" and instead ended up as little more than an advertisement trying to make people buy the comics.
Dan Vs Pinkie Pie. Dan has no chance.

I want a shirt that says "Jerk"

Haku is one of many creatures that have never, but has always, existed
00,02i want dat mod
Ohai RD :D
[SWAG]Haku: I see
xD
ppl sure like riding on RD ;)
For example, one of Haku's brother's is the embodiment of action
ok yeah that'll be it for me I really need to go to bed it's like almost five and celestia will almost raise the sun
yo :P
Night yall
hello oni_link
night CrimsonPhoenix
[SWAG]Haku: and what of Haku?
Also, Fluttershy dragons :D
Haku is the embodiment of the idea
Not just AN idea, but all ideas
I was tempted to add one or 2 of the MLP mods to my Skyrim let's play, like maybe the Fluttershy dragons, though I couldn't bring myself to kill them if I did that...lol
Since the first idea was thought of, Haku has existed, but Haku also existed before then also
I want this game so bad :(
It is dificult for some to understand
Eh, you can have it
Think multidimensionally
[SWAG]Haku: Haku is a perpetual thought that has always existed, before Haku existed.
That is one way of putting it, I suppose
So...anyone else waiting for the 1:1 scale P-body portal gun? I'm buying one the moment it's available.
00,02i think that worked
He existed since FORRRREEEEVVVVEEEERRRRRRRR
00,02OtakuTom, wait what?
might need a reset?
Thinkgeek is selling some of the limited edition 1:1 scale replicas of P-body's portal gun in a few hours.
So, Haku is everything that you are thinking, what you have thought, and what you will think. And because an idea can not die, simply change host, Haku can not die
Ugh, Direct X always does that to me.
I dont like constantly re-installinh
*installing
Only 5000 are being made, and Thinkgeek has some of them. I have the page on auto-refresh so I can grab one as soon as they're available. (140 USD, not including shipping)
hai everypony. :3
So what is it that we are now watching?
Oh, the Skyrim?
And idea
Though, both are kinda the same
:O
Ride the derpy!!!
But again, not just one thought
/me turns into yandere mode
[SWAG]Haku: all the thoughts
HAI
Think of how DIscord is the living embodiment of Chaos
00,02i require more money
Phase4: kill ppl
unskinned pony horse...slightly creepy...lol
He always existed, but he didnt physically exist until he was able to have a body
OtakuTom: IRK
*IKR
*derp*
Phase4: steal it the bounty should be less than the horse :S
And then the Pinkie Pie/ Smile video appears
dem scary sounding recruiters
I love that video XD
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, do i get to keep the horse?
...／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿
00,02only need 400 godl
lol
00,02must be a cave around here somewhere with some bandidts in it
Phase4: uh... thats a good question actually, so far in my skyrim adventures whenever i get a horse they seem to dissapear for awhile then comback so
*shrugs
Kill all the horses!
hey guys just got out of the shower whew that felt good
They are backstabbing thieves!
But ponies are cool
/me is ready to stab someone
They may live
I'm trying to remember where there's some caverns near Whiterun...then again, I'm still not far in the game, and I'm not familiar with the entire area yet.
／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼﻿
Spell-of-Gaming what's with the face?
Phase4: go to the tavern in town, talk to the bartender ask about rumors you'll get a quest thats at a cave near by
Spell-of-Gaming: ready for a contract?
00,02i'm catching fish
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, k
lol, fish
Fish are weird
chat derped
I should probably watch Madoka. I've seen a lot of great stuff from the fandom, and it seems to be one of the big shows right now.
Always witht he "glub glub" and "I cant breathe on land" and "Please dont eat me." Selfish basturds.
It's kinda special that half of the time fish has taste, half of the time it doesn't.
Fish isnt that healthy anymore
you should only eat fish once every 3 months
Too much mercury in them now
Depends on your country.
I'm allergic to most seafood :(
[SWAG]Haku: I didn't know that
Indeed so
Although I geuss you CAN eat them, but again, its not really healthy anymore
Which makes my fiance sad, 'cause she loves eating fish
Hows the sayin go? "The best things in life are the unhealthiest?"
So wait, graduation is unhealthy?
Well, I geuss its also with how much fish you eat too when you actually eat fish
[SWAG]Haku: Another one is, " Tastes so good it has to be fattening."
00,02um
00,02where did skyrim go
00,02it went to space
We're not at that point in the stream yet, Phase :P
GOODNIGHT EVERYPONY! :)
There it goes :P
night Ponies47
Did it just completely crash?
Spell-of-Gaming Yes, graduation isnt healthy. Have you seen kids nowadays? If you dont get into college, your pretty much fucked over for life. And then you might still be fucked even if you DO get into college! Youth today are extremely stressed out
Well my stream already crashed :D
nite Ponies47
00,02skyrim wont let go of my mouse
Flash derped :/
[SWAG]Haku: kids should learn to take it easy and settle for more humble jobs as well :D
And... having shelter is unhealthy?
00,02oh
Its not about humble jobs, its about there not being any jobs!
00,02so thats how you run
00,02wat
EVen the jobs that teens should have are being taken by adults
So yeah. Good night,wubs and all that other (squee) :p
00,02it isnstant crashes when it tries to load the city
was it shift?
00,02oni_link, left alt
weird.
Go to a fast food joint today and you tell me how many people working there might be in high school
Night Ponies47!
00,02well
00,02um
00,02skyrim is broke
Hmm...
Yea...I had to learn how to run the hard way...while trying to escape from a giant (I failed)
Make the dragon and giant fight to the death
[SWAG]Haku: None. In my country, at least. :I
And what country is that?
[SWAG]Haku: not many fast foods here :D more restaurants/bakeries
Phase4: i'm just going to say, I'll enjoy watching anything you do but, if you can make it to minmus today there be a "present" for you, not related to the other present I mentioned but, ithink you'll get a kick outta it :)
huh i didnt think i typed that much
Is it becaus of the model imports you put in earlier Phase4 ?
We seriously need more ACTUAL restaurants than fast food restaurants.
GASP
lol
STEAM SUMMER SALE?!
00,02oni_link, not sure
00,02Spell-of-Gaming, STEAM SUMMER SLAES
slaes are best things
steam sales are quite dissapointing this year though
nothing new on a decent offer
EH, Haku wouldnt know
Haku doesnt have steam
Phase4, worst case scenario, you would have to re-install... But I think maybe you can undo the file paste instead
00,02oni_link, i can verify integrity, if that doesnt work i can manually remove
00,02wont be hard
How much dub could dubstep step if dubstep could step dub?
HOLY CRAP, TERRARIA IS FIVE DOLLARS?!
Phase4: Hmm, sounds like a good idea
00,02nothing i realy want on the sales right now
00,02thank gofd
00,02god'
/me wants all the things
well, goood night fellows
Haku shall be off for now
/me is pretty much satisfied, but still has a big steam wishlist
Yea, I really don't have anything that I've really wanted from the steam sale this year.
I've clocked up 13 hours on MW3 Multiplayer since receiving it as a gift on Friday
:D
All the games that I'm interested in that went on sale are games I already have.
Anyone wants a copy of Frozen Synapse? :D
Wait...terraria is $5? Maybe I'll grab that.
Minecraft > Terraria
Yea, but I have friends that play both
And I already have Minecraft :P
Terraria is exactly $4.99.
00,02minecraft is a thing i dont play much
Terraria is probably got its Summer Sale price from the App Store.
iv spent maybe 4 hours a day on average since alpha
I'm glad I haven't had any games to buy through the sale, it means I can get the portal gun once thinkgeek puts it up.
dat zooming text
Oh, I finally got my Zero Suit Samus figure in the mail yesterday :3
cool
OtakuTom: niiiiice
I installed the Source Film Maker, but I haven't touched it yet...maybe I should sometime soon...lol
00,02OH GOD

00,02later MahBoi777
dat .NET framework fail
Oh Fallout 3
nvm
and blackness
wow that was weird
I have yet to play a Fallout game. People keep recommending them to me due to the whole RPG aspect of it, but I just don't like games with a major FPS focus (which is probably why I wasn't completely absorbed by Skyrim, either, though I do enjoy it)
Here we go
I tried playing Skyrim in 3rd-person, but couldn't do it, so I've stuck to first-person, and it starts to make me dizzy.
11,02Night all ^-^

Phase4: well if you want xp, girl is the way to go, theres a perk for more xp
Khajit...wait...wrong game...
Chrysalis ehhh a bit if you like open world games
00,02GODDAMNITBETHESDAENGINE
also, you get the perk that does bonus damage against male enemies
00,02its stolen my mouse
00,02i cant turn the volume up and i cant hear
which is far more powerful than the male equivelant
00,02and then i accidentaly fallout 3
Phase4: Meanwhile in Bethesda, they're planning to destroy Australia
00,02well
00,02no bethesda games for me it seems :(
:(
00,02how do i have soo many games
so many?
i was just typing youre collection is quite small
i didnt know Stacking was a game
its in one of the indie packs from the steam sale
lol...his collection is even bigger than mine
my collection is nearing 300 games right now
00,02dis should be interesting
I have...maybe...35? 40?
00,02oh one sec
00,02stupid nvidia
already finish stacking :p is good
I love the no spoilers rule. <3 I want it to be new for me.
oh this game Phase4 this is a good-un from what i've heard
excuse me while i sit on your head
inb4 "I want you inside me"-esqe joke
uhh
well...chat is pretty much ded
Dolls are hobos?
In the Real Life version Levi the Hobo turns into Peter the Pedophile
xD
/me is busy rearranging hid Kid Icarus cards
now is a bunch of pissed off people shouting with signs really that hard to "find"
Mind Control?
I'm still watching that thinkgeek page...with my luck, the portal gun will go on sale while I'm on the road and will sell out before I get home (they're expecting it to sell out within 15 minutes of it going up.
alright man, good luck
Sweet guys. im getting an ipad 3
XD
you poor thing
...okay...this sucks...
hi everyone :3
I just found out it's going on sale between 12:00 and 17:00 Eastern time (11:00 and 16:00 my time), which is in the middle of when I'm asleep >_<
hi Hrafn
OtakuTom: i'll buy it for you all i need is your credit card number :3
and your social security
I wonder if I could configure Thunderbird to alert me only when I get an email from them and not other general emails...
or just set an alarm for 11?
la la la
OH. you could just stay up. read some creepypasta
well Comic Con was fun

just a small town girl
quiet here aint it
eeyup
is there a stream right now?
hi everyone
I see phase is palying Stacking.
The problem is I get home from work at 7:00, have to stay up until at least 8:30, then wake up by 18:00 at the latest to get ready for work.
DeadpoolDash: yes
okay, I wont post youtube vids then
So if I were to wake up (or stay up) past 11:00, and the item doesn't go on sale until, say, 15:00, I'll be severely lacking sleep before work.
call in sick. nopony needs to know why
00,02soo much cutsceen
this game looks really cool :o
levi is so talented. Y U NO GET JOB LEVI?
We're a 24/7 operation, and I'm the only one here overnight. If I call in sick, someone else gets called to work my shift (not fun trying to get that to happen, especially for the one who gets called in, I know from firsthand experience)
maybe find someone to trade days with you?
I'm not gonna go that far to buy a replica Portal gun
make one with legos. XD dont step on em though
I've been meaning to rebuild my lego collection (old collection was thrown away with stuff damaged in a flood)
I wish I had a real functional portal gun, but then again, I would probably end up dying within one minute of getting it
would take about ten seconds before I decide to try shooting it at the moon
I'd never use mine on anything other than walls...I'd rather not screw too much with physics. I'm accident prone enough...lol
Ello everyone, what are we watching?
Hey Malavolent. Phase is playing Stacking.
Yarr
ducks
i want my own dashie :'(
What is this game about?
It seems interesting,
It's an adventure/puzzle game made by Double Fine
That's enough for me to know that I'm buying it soon...lol
That stacking thing is... original.
you walk around. talk to people then WHAM suprise buttsecs
I guess I'll try it.
it looks like a really interesting game :3
/me growls

00,02i have no clue what i'm doing

Phase4 mind if i spoil the game or want to find out yourself ?

I enjoyed the WWII medal of honor games.
Not the modern ones.

Hello MadSurge.

x1es, i think the WW shooters have dried up
There is only one way I would buy Battlefield 4. That is if is a future shooter.
Like Battlefield 2142.
I enjoyed that game immensely.
XAX, i think the WW shooters have dried up
1942 was the best
DeadpoolDash: Still got the discs <3
dear god doo this http://cheezburger.com/6173322496
128 player servers was intense
Oh god yes
DeadpoolDash: Did you play DC on 1942?
yes
:D
Desert Combat was pretty awesome
It was.
Barrett .50 Cal.
the helicopters were a bit of a pain though

In single player they were ez to fly
But I couldn't fly them for shit with even the slightest bit of lag on Multiplayer

I almost got my Derpy order canceled last night via typo - 6_9 seller couldnt get one at CC, so is working to aquire order through a friend.
05a bowl of hazelnut müsli, a berocca, 2 sammiches and a cup o coffee

WE HAVE THAT?
:p
lol
What's the swedish word for it?
Konsument Lagen?
Wrek: So what did you order?
I'm guessing Twilight.
i wanna guess a custom made Twilight doll
05konsumentsverket
05anyways
05basically i could claim them to reduce price/return the money
05jsut casue they had already been payed
05had it been a serious shipent, say a wedding dress
05thye could be fined for delaying so long
I know I know, luckily I haven't been in that trouble yet
05saldy a pony shirt isnt covered under that :P
But isn't that only for national issues?
What kind of pony shirt Wrek?

Phase4: You know where all the praxis are?
Been to the LIMB yet?
00,02Vordox, does limb restock?
05actually Vordox sicne they ship to us they have to abide by our consumer laws
Phase4: Each visit in the same city yes
05the same reason games for windows live doesnt exist in soem coutnries
05casue the ToS violates the law
>.>
Well, that's pretty neat. I'll have to remember that.
00,02Vordox, ah
Phase4: Each time you get into a new place of the city it restocks.

Hi dudes! :)
hello MegaMoonShine
05waht i find hilarious with sweden in particular is how people keep complaining and demanding better even when its ratehr decent
05never seem satisfied
For the natiosn best interest? I thought they just did it for personal gain.
05with has both good and bad consequences
nations*
05Kammerjunk: 2 words same meaning
Fair 'nuff.
Nobody is ever Satisfied
Things are pretty good in New Zealand. I don't hear anything about people complaining about laws or policies here.
I don't follow politics well enough to know if people are unhappy about it here, but they probably are.
good job Phase :3
He's about to blow up
:P
HE JUST AFFORDED IT

Darkts3: Already have several on the lineup, can't take anymore.
Aps: lol
Aps: :D
Vordox: alright
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: There's plenty of sprites you can do yourself though
Aps: You do realise most of Australia is desert right?
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Most here already started trying to do their own sprites, Kirz, Lil_b etc etc
Vordox: i dont know how to do my own sprites
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: You can start with not making them Just edit already existing ones
There's plenty of things you can look at as references from the pack that follows along the DP
Even take their bases and edit in your own things
Vordox: yes, but how?
Use an art program
GIMP, PSP, Photoshop, MSPaint even if you want to
Vordox: okay :)
is there a desktop pony of Hugh Jelly ?
TrixieMuffin: No iddea, there's plenty of people doing sprites for DP
Too many to count

Okay, I'm back...and I'm still stuck in the mental struggle of staying up for the portal gun or sleeping and risking not waking up to any potential email alert...
OtakuTom: Wait what? :o
OtakuTom: a portal gun?
Yea, I should probably shut up about it...lol...I keep ending up telling more and more people about it.
Wrek be getting oooold?

It's a 1:1 scale replica of P-body's orange/red portal gun.
portal gun you say?
Only 5000 are being made for worldwide distribution, and Thinkgeek is getting some of them.
and only 2 are the real portal gun
It'll be made available sometime between 12:00 and 17:00 Eastern Time (11:00 and 16:00 my time)
