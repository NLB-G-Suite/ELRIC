I hate Simple Machines Forum
lolwut
SMF is awesome
12^
PHPBB is a piece of crap
IPB and vBulletin are expensive
no expandibility, overboard on puzzles for registration
poor features
I like vBulletin, but honestly, SMF is the best free forum software
lolwut
You don't have to have those puzzles, and most of them are mods anyway
You can change the difficulty of it and by default, there's only one
12lol, I've never seen any puzzles XD
Because people are idiots and decide to make it difficult lol
by default it's not hard
but people install mods that just suck
not to mention social integration and arcades
12and for a price
munnie$
Simple Machines Forum does not have crap in comparison
its bare bones
but still
EWW SIMPLE MACHINES FORUM
Not everyone has the money for vBulletin
SMF > PHPBB though
PHPBB...urgh
12Ew people that copy drf by saying eww everything they don't like
the administration panel made me shat brix
if I had the choice between Simple Machines Forum or no forum at all
I would pick no forum at all
It's their choice
lol
I like SMF
have you tried SMF 2?
noforum=nocommunity
02NS :<
12SMF 2 is pretty awesome. I don’t find it easy to code though
Well
It's a lot nicer-looking than the previous SMF
The previous SMF was kinda old-looking IMO
it has some pretty nice features and it's also more user-friendly
are the over the top puzzles gone?
The over the top puzzles were mods that people installed
by default it's only a pretty simple just letters puzzle
ohaidere
02No one asked you
Pretty much
But don't tell me that you prefer PHPBB
._.
I don't
I even did not like Proboards
despite a forum I read quite a bit being based on it
12lol Proboards
proboards is crappy
o.o
12All I can think of when I hear the word Proboards is free hosting
._.
which is basically it
02lolforumotion
the forum on Proboards was oddly enough left to me and I wanted it off of there
02Ohwait
forumotion is actually decent for a free forum host
Well, it used to
before it forced all that sh*t on its users
12So many advertisements though
Yeah, the advertisements
We used to be able to limit them to guests only
or even disable them at one point, which I did
And it stayed that way for a while because they didn't realise
04o-o
02wb

04In fact I'll be away for a while

03ooh
uuuuuuuuuuuh
why do you want it?
ftw?
12To use it as a base for other scripts
03wtf
._.
03it says sucks.com is already registered
03but it doesn't actually do anything
03odd
12You should also buy o3o.net
03why don't you do it
12and o3o.com
that's the old script
03but
03that sucks
12Thanks
03on *:TEXT:*!apple*:#:{
03msg $chan $read colors.txt $+ EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW $read apple.txt
03}
pokemon.txt goes in C:\Documents and Settings\%USER%\Application Data\mIRC
03because that way
nah
03you can use colors.txt and put the LIST OF ALLOWED COLORS *cough*
that's bloated
03also rofl application data
03I keep mine in C:/sysreset
because mIRC takes longer to read from a .txt file than using vars
03soZ?
03-Z
03it's not like the script really lags.
it lags the script more :p
and besides
without having more .txt files
I don't want to search through it
03one text files covers all the randomscripts though
03but w/e
you can cover it in one line too :p
03per script
03OW MY EYES
Besides
12night all
12~
03wait no
12Good night
03shoot
03because of the colors
03I was going to say
03store it like "A Blastoise" in the text file
03so that you can do "an Exeggcute" etc
03but that would mess up the colors :/
a %color $+ Blastoise
because $read can parse the % in the file as well
03wait
03you can actually put that in the text file?
Yes
03holy crap
and besides
and add a/an in front
03then let me do
03*do it
I could script it anyway
I don't need to do it
/me hides
lmfao
they're separated
03oh
03OK
pokemon1.txt, pokemon2.txt, etc.
03can I replace everything in gen5 with "stupid creature"?
lmfao
03I want to
03so badly
you'd just have to
replace the file
pokemon5.txt
03yeah
03no
lol
03because they all suck
you should see the part
?
03ugh
03brb reboot
that part is like 4 lines
12How do I make the .txt file, NS?
pokemon1
pokemon2
pokemon3
etc.
12Ah
in the text file
12Sounds easy
yes
that's the easy part
"sounds"
it is easy though
the current one is not
Yes I've been on for a while
12o-o
Good
after everything has been parsed
Overcomplicated much? :P
not particularly :p
it basically concats the numbers
12So I just put the .txt file in my mIRC folder?
then uses $mid to select one
yes
12k
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LKa1Y9_ok XD
lolwut
A;sp readini/writeini would probably have been simpler than using vars.
Also*
it uses writeini/readini to write the settings for each user to a file

UGH, w/e NS
DLL debugging is being a b***********
lmfao
UMADmads, that's why I don't do DLL debugging :p
I wish I didn't do it either. rofl :(
The first step is acknowledging the problem
heh
lmfaao
Try doing C++ classes
NS, how bout i just not listen to ANYTHING you say instead >_>
<3<3
All written by me, but they aren't exactly integrating well. XD;
They worked fine separately.
You don't want to listen :p
but connecting them all causes things to go "LOOOOLLL (°Дo)???"
hmmmmmmm
haha UMADmads
dlls are annoying as crap
and I haven't done C# or Lua
No. NS, I can't be forced to listen to ANYONE
If you want people to stop laughing at you and thinking you're annoying, then listen
C++ classes are a bit cryptic
e_o
*y
Never even heard of Lua.
java is annoying
What's wrong with java?
12lol
debugging java makes me want to go back into C++
x-x
I like java. :o
It's just annoying
c++ runs faster tho
<3.=.<3
it's good for some things
and java has more bugs than my garden does
Lawl.
but java has inbuilt libraries for UI and graphics
Eww
:(
but VB is windoes-onry
C++ is my bishie.
>>
yeah
Lua's getting there.
VB is easy
;3
C#, not really but I'm forcing myself to get used to it lol
drf was trying to made a tag stripper UI in VB? and he gave up
Only word I saw in that was "stripper"
But you should at least listen and maybe take a hint
Plus, you're not very good with advice regardless.
^.=.^ *wicks*
You'd be surprised, lol
I dont have to NS
wha?
I only use it for making UIs because I hate programming UIs. lol
I also herd C# is "java done right"
is
I also herd "QT is easy to learn"
Licks
12Actually, NS seems to be pretty good at advise giving XD
derp
GL, like i give a crap
What's Lua like? I haven't heard of it before.
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
At least I would be if this DLL would quit being a friggin jackbrat.
C++ makes me want to go back to COBOL even
or FORTRAN for that matter
*cries*
COBOL is horrible XD
well NS, I dont
Right now you're not taking reason at all
The syntax of it's pretty easy to get, and it's fast and easy to integrate too.
why should i
to any christians that is
Umm..hello, I was a christan thank you.
>>
Am or was?
shh
idk to be honest
I meant that as an analogy
UGH
just w/e
Nice, UMADmads
I haven't done proper programming for months
*lick*
*licks?*
And treat you the way they do
stop lying
its annoying
thenagain, there are loads of people here that won't change their ways about something
and people need to change
like you
12Advise! =Trolling
lmfao
you need to be nicer for one
I fail to see how she isn't being nice right now. rofl
I don't know whether to laugh or cry with laughter
is this discussion going anywhere ?
Not that I can see. lol
You ARENT
STOP FKING LYING
that much
But I'm getting a kick out of it all the same.
you're never nice
at all
you arent
How am I not being nice?
you constantly disrepect me
How am I not being nice?
And I do respect you, just not when you're being stupid
Yes, and that answer is?
yeah right
Answer?
you never had one ounce of respect the moment ive arrived here
you treat me and a few others like crap :P
Honestly, I do sometimes, I know that
really now?
But that doesn't mean I don't have respect
07oi, removing one letter from a swear word doesn't make it ok to use here
You should be saying that to me >:
07o3o
hey, I AM being nice right now
yeah right
I don't understand how I'm not being nice lol
she isn't the one swearing.
XD
lmao
*Sigh*
06what
07a person can't say whether they're nice or not, it all depends on the opinion of others lol
and i've heard others opinions about her
But I don't see anyone else saying I'm being mean, unless you are :p
people tell me things >>
I know people don't like me
12I think NS is being perfectly nice rofl
derp
07I'm saying if someone's thinking you're being mean, then that doesn't mean you're being nice
07I'm not saying either
07=P
lol
06The stupid burns D:
Heh
He can at least tell me how I'm being mean right now
07and more importantly
06trolling because it's awesome is like swearing because it's edgy and hardcore

/me hides
07well, you're being blunt
The fact remains I could be more blunt
07and being blunt is the mean version on being truthful
07=P
06And while it's not always needed
06sometimes it is
I'm being truthful and not completely blunt :p
pony...
07truth that isn't necessarily something that wants to be heard by someone is generally considered blunt, depending on the person's tolerance
07at all.
07:'D
lol
lmfao
I thought bluntness was determined by how few words you used. lol
hahaha
07well
07that too
And I'd prefer to tell people the truth rather than dodging around the topic
And reasonably, I'm not exactly being THAT blunt either

you're welcome
our neighbors just got back from their 3 week vacation in Florida
they had a good time, but they said it was very hot
They should've brought me with them.
LMAO
lol
10Ohmy
05Oh dear
IDK how you'd like Italy
or if
Probably more than Florida.
at least the pizza is good
and the Coca Cola
i.e., everything.
:(
I had some good pizza at a restaurant in Idaho
At a mostly Montana chain
12|3
Is Montana really a place?
4I call an eviction
I thought they were just like "hey, we need a name for this void between here and Canada"
I think it's more like acquired land
exactly
the western half is cool, the eastern half is excessively boring
lol, I can imagine.
speed limits on the main highways are 80 MPH and there are no cops
Long highways with nothing to run into.
65 in construction zones xD
rofl
05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMjAhbjqnj0
/me runs from the squeals
there are a lot of fast cars and rich people in Florida
but then there's also a very high rate of homelessness and poverty
lol
And college kids and old people.
the state with both extremes
but you knew I'd say that. lol
would you fall into the only possibly applicable one?
haha
LOL
That's quite cool.
I dunno actually, considering I'm not in college anymore.
nuhuh
uhhuh
you're just sorta there?
yup.
just for more wtfs
lookin for a way and a reason to gtfo.
you have the reason
heat, traffic, tourists
I might have a job here in town in a few weeks XD;
ok
cool, maybe
which is partly cool because I'll ya know
have a job
but it sucks because well, yeah.
any other suggestions for funness?
Programming military training sims.
wow
I hope to be able to design roller coasters and other thrill rides
Wasn't allowed to take pictures but it was pretty mind blowing XD
wow
I could imagine
my dad's in the Navy, that's why we're here
I have family in the Army, but that's not why I'm here lol
13Nope
brb, I need some milk
No one wants to make emo music.
from Honolulu of all places
and they're looking for programmers.
It's not "emo".
I take offense to that you racist >:(
/me shot

02DDDDD:
I can't believe I just chugged down a whole glass
02now, I need to fix something
I had to get another half glass for some enjoyment lol
I do that a lot lol
02there.
02:3c
milk never lasts in my house
05Uh, 4Chan for that, guys>
I've never had problems with mi-
in the past
then one day I decided I hated not drinking milk.
and all has been well ever since.
4Yeah it is
4cuz you made it
nomm

If I were just a brain in a jar everything would be fine.

how could you use MIRC?
D=
Because mIRC is full of win.
I'd have wires that let me use computers. lol
I've heard of that before
hi pd

heh
My nervous system would be wired into a bunch of machines instead of a body.
He's getting there.
Electronica? or Breakbeat (Drum 'n' Bass)
I think you're talking about +f.
Yeah, he can't move any body part except one of his cheeks.
Wow...
+f lines:seconds
that would not be fun
You are ignorant.

3Nah

Like how Tama is "the first cat to hold a managerial position at a train station."
4I turned it off after 10 min
4god
not normally the kind of thing cats aspire to.
4I ahted it
lol
My sister watched it, i saw it for a few seconds and hated it
I guess thats unfair but still
My cat aspires to
exist
D=
Not to...
Cats have aspirations?
Oh I forgot, world domination.
Evil cats.
yes of course. lol
my cat has the aspiration to sit somewhere where she can be warm
unless it's all a part of her bigger scheme.
absorb the heat
then one day

LOL
I didn't go anywhere
And agajn
I know XD
I tried to upgrade my router to ipv6
o.o
Bad idea
needless to say it's being dumb.
not really
as it's cool
I think it'll be another decade before we switch to IPv6 locally
well
right now I have both
but
ipv6 eliminates the need for port forwarding <3
you need it for router
to be able to use Xbox live and such
That's why XD
I never use online for any consoles, well, maybe
Does the 3DS need forwarding too?
not unless you want fast speeds
I'm fine with that :)

we were referring to that :p
I just need to set up services now.
Ok....
6Awesome.
Nice email adress.....
04NIGHTSHADOW
Then I can look into writing some server modules, like wordfilters.
:D
6...can you take off the stupid emotes?
6I HATE emotes.
No, that's mibbit.
You can turn them off in mibbit though.
6...FAWK
Just click on the a smiley.
It should turn into normal text.
6:)
6:D
Haha, no problem. XD
6:(:/:P:O;)
6:)
6FAWK
6It doesn't stay that way... =(
6Guess I'm stuck using =
6I just like using : for : D
12Well, seeya everyone
Maybe you have to turn each individual smiley face off?
bye GL
06g'd bye GL :
6I do.
6It's dumb.
12Bia
6Are you sure you can't write a script for it?
Nah, that's not possible, because it's just something that mibbit does.
Mibbit should have a setting to turn them off though.
06yup, back
6...ew. Work.
6...ew. Pointless work.
How It Works
see Prefs -> Smileys (main client or widget manager):
Width: The width of the smiley when shown.
Height: The height of the smiley when shown.
Base URL: The common first part for all icons in the URL column.
Code: Mibbit searches for the code of each line of text for this, and replaces it with the picture hosted on the Icon URL.
You can turn them off then.
6Bleh.
6I want them turned off for everypony, is the thing... *shrug*
That's not possible then.
6Because mibbit is FAIL
6But we've already established this.
Unless I finish making my own client, which I'm too lazy to do.
6lol
6Maybe some day.
6Maybe some day.
6That. Would. Be. Win.
6Put pony games on it. =D
"!!Spike & !!Twilight leaving are the most notable and sad of these changes..."
They left? O_o
6Yep.
6Yesterday.
Why?
6Dunno.
6Likely all the recent mudfests finally got to them.
6It is a shame though...
6!!Spike even asked to be permabanned with no appeal.
6And was.
That's weird, !!Spike didn't seem like the kind of person to just give up to me, I'd never really seen !!Twilight speak.
6Granted, !!Spike's fuse wasn't exactly the longest, but not nearly as bad as !!Twilight's.
It's just that's all I've ever called the serpent.

10RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
02:3
8nice
6I actually have all 3 Godfathers. XD
8btw, this is going to be far and away the longest movie night
6I know.
6Other than the banner dari's working on...
10yup
8no, but i was literally about to ask you
6Since they'll never get picked in a lotto anyway.
born in Mississippi, raised in... Washington -_______-
6And it would be unfair to the lotto winners to stream any other eps.
13I have yet to see godfather.
8DAH
8HOW HAS NO ONE SEEN THE GODFATHER?!
6I have. :D
I have.
6And I'll be watching it again tonight to make sure it works.
8ive seen it like 10 times
Though I fell asleep during the second and third ones. :P
8i have 3 movies saved on my computer
8the godfather
8godfather part 2
8and the hurt locker
Lawl.
Wait wut happened to the third one? :P
8cuz those are 3 of my favorites
13Haven't seen all 3 of those
8the third one is garbage
8not worth watching
13xD
8 3rd godfather movie i should say
13Meh. I just don't watch a lot of movies.
8everyone should see the godfather though
8one of the greatest movies ever
I'll just render it and upload.
Then you can tell me it's crap. :P
6:D
It looks how you said you wanted it at any rate.
6Also, guys.
8nice
6And seeing as they plug us most shows, I think we should at least plug them this week.
6And make them a partner when we start doing that.
8http://knowyourmeme.com/system/icons/2085/original/Kornheiser_Why.JPG?1267079689
6I know.
XD
8yeah, for sure
And they say "Wut" then ping out.
6Yeah, I was talking to him in depth last night.
/me just launched: Unreal Tournament GOTY (1998/1999) DEDICATED SERVER (beta) (unreal://192.168.137.1:777)
06*7777
6YES.
6ALL THE YES
8fucking awesome
6*saves for now*
You want anything changed?
6Looks great.
8maybe an exclamation point at the end
6...yeah, I guess I forgot to type that originally.
6My bad...
06Kyubeys
777777777777777777
Can do.
10666
06my irc app for the iPad is called irc999
I think that's the Quake port. lol
06i always call it irc666
6I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT
13!espeon
06it uses Quake technology :P
Lawl.
Hypnosis at its best.
(Owait, that's MLP)
8where are we putting the banner up, in place of the normal one?
The early stage: "WHY CAN'T I STOP WATHCING THIS?!?!"
6I was going to put it under the normal one.
stages*
8as long as its not in the viewing field
8could get distracting
6Oh, it won't be.
6The countdown clock is barely in the viewing field.
6And it'll be well above that.
/me closes the server for maintnance and bedtime
6It'll be between the regular banner and the site links.
06Gnite all
06~
12seeya
4Any reason in particular?
8boredom?
4Oh
8also, working on a few things
LOL
8like the banner dari is making
Ahahaha, you two are the same person.
4What's the banner idea?
4Ah
6http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Banner-3.gif
6He's putting in an exclamation point at the end.
4Looks good
6We tentatively decided on streaming Eps 1 and 2 at a time to have them end at 7 PM
4So airing the pilot
4Nice
6Yeah.
6Since they'd never get picked in the lotto
6And playing any other eps in a marathon would be unfair to the lotto winners.
4*either
6Obviously this would have been run by you guys tomorrow... luckily you're all just on today. XD
03WUT.
4I saw that Hip was playing TF2 earlier. Is it running well?
6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEnope.
8nope.avi
8deleted it from my laptop cuz it doesnt run AT ALL
8well
8it dies technically
8does*
4Shame
4Oh, Sprinks
4Have you tried it yet?
6I have.
6Offline.
/me shot
4What did you think?
6Love it.
6I'd be playing it now if I could.
6I know.
6I was hoping you'd be on earlier, since I could play on the wifi I was using then...
whole*
4Well, I'm on now Sprinks
4Glad you got it working, dari XD
12!Espeon
12:3
6XD
6That sucks dari...
I'll upload, you guys tell me which one you like more.
6Cools.
12Nope XD
13Ah, alright then xD
12Yes
Especially people's reactions.
13:3
13Just wanted to make that clear in my mind xD
12Ah I see :3
6I think it would be hilarious.
Stronger colours: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Banner-less_sparkle.gif
6I like the stronger colours version.
4I'm against wordfilters on IRC
4Well
4Yeah
4I am
6Like, necessary ones.
4Nigger?
4Seriously?
4How often do we get people saying something like that in here?
6Well, I'm saying we could impliment them as we need to.
6It's just the option of having them, really.
4If we do implement them, do it for the laughs
4Not for "safety"
8no no
4Yeah, but not have it ALL THE TIME
6Oh, yeah, that's cool dari.
4Like, one BMN just have it on
4But just for the laughs and that's it
FLOOT!
6MOOT?
4Yeah, no
4Or yes
4No as in "no"
4However
4That does bring up the idea of April Fools Day if BMN is still going by next April
6XD
6That would be hilarious.
