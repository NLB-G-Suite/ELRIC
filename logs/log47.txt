...in the closet now : /
0He's in the closet you guise
/me snores
unfortunately, i have to use office 2010 for making an organization chart, because 03 has a very strange bug
*knocks* Umm...I-I can hear someone sleeping
Will you open the door, please?
03LOL what
I can't really breath in here, and there's this really weird smell
/me mumbles something about sprinkles and rolls over, drooling
Smells like syrup
03well I use 2000. It's like 2003 but less bloated.
if you add some more elements to my chart on 03, all the new elements are copies of one old element
7o.o
deleting elements makes things worse
03heh
I'll save you!!!
Oh god, why would anyone keep Pony menstruation blood in a company closet?!
/me drops his plate of pancakes from last weeks brunch as he adjusts himself
03if I can get 2000, 2007, and 2010 all to install at the same time again, I might.
like, if you add text to one, 3 others will mirror it.
/me 0begins placing random objects on Sleeping_Against_Closet_Door_Gs face
03I had it before but then 2000 started freezing instead of opening and I was like x.x
Does this rag smell like chloroform?
0BAHA
...Oh, that was just Aunt Jamima's syrup
(how would you know where it came from, Trapped?)
because it wants to rerpair itself,
right?
...can I have some?
03no
03you can tell it not to
(I mean really, how do you identify it as Menstrual blood?)
Did someone say menstruation blood?
7o.o
Aha, so it /was/ just pancakes
Cause that's gross.
or just pancakes.
Can someone pour syrup on me?
whatcha want, bro-stack?
MMM PANCAKES AND SYRUP
03anyway
0Pancakes and Syrup.. Sounds like a match made in heaven <3
Can I get some of that sweet, sweet syrupy goodness?
03I should prolly try to get to bed
well hey there Kevin, what's for breakfast?
Just pour it all over me
03and run some data recovery program on my screwed up ex-RAID drive
o\
oh Pancakes, you big kidder, not in front of our roommate
Oh, hey Kevin. How are you this morning?
yeah thats the problem with raid0
0Yeah syrup, drip all over those pancakes
lose 1, lose em all
That's kinky.
better to have separate drives instead
mmm.
I didn't mean it, Syrup. It was an honest mistake :(
03nope
03it was raid6
oh RBD, knock it off, you know I'm a Silver Ringer
03er
035
03not 09
03-9
03basically though
7o.o
03I had 2TB of TV recordings on an external drive
03I did ctrl+x and moved them all to my 8TB RAID array
03RAID array breaks and I lose my data
03so I need to run recovery on that older drive to get the crap back
(how many of you are looking up what that means?)
I found our theme song.
oh
And I would be XD
I'm not, sweetness ;)
/me 0doesn't know what a silver ringer is. and even though he tried to look it up is none the wiser
here it is.

I might as well stay up now.
nothing quite like seeing every pain you know, in someone elses writing. especially in a means you have opened yourself to, I.E. ponies

I haven't read black and white.
it's an amazing story. only 22 pages or so
0hmm it sounds like i should read it
0D:

Damn.
I'll read it in tha AM.
it's one of those Humanizing stories, brings the ponies home if you know what I mena
yeah.
I'm passin' out
but, after 3 hours, I have regained all physical control and calmed down, so I think it's time to go home and sleep
So why did you drive off to recover so early in the morning?

hmm
Just remembered lol.
Me n silver n rainbro just watching...
XD
welp, as much as I love sexy time with my imaginary colt-friend, since apparently SilverMane is a coltcuddler,
I need to get some sleep
:(
well silvermane it was a blast
0SilverMane is a colt cuddler, I think Tim is straight xP
I'll see you guys some this week for sure.
ALL this week since I'm bored as fuck.
0Polarfire you should definitely pop in
0I'll be around, mostly late
For you or me XD
OH CRAP HE LEARNED MY NAME
TIM
i like
NOT YOU TOO
0OH CRAP INb4 RBD STALKS YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH
don't worry its safe with me ;)
0NOT WITH ME
0MUWAAHAHAHAHA
0no
funniest... smile face... ever
0most unexpected smilie ever
0every single time i use it i'm like... betterthanexpected.jpg
lol
welp, if you guys want to talk to me in a less 'omfg what are the smoking?' environment, I am Flamyras on FJ, SilverMane on Flankbook, and Bloodharp on the PS3
0I'm not on Flankbook
0and gay, get xbox
0:3
in general, look for Flamyras, Bloodharp, SilverMane, or Fairith and you have found me
I dont have either... not really a gamer
xbox = trashcan.jpg
inb4 broken up with for dissing xbox
aww :(
0no that just makes me mad ;)
I don't really know where to tell you guys to get a hold of me...
here I guess.
0and silvermane knows what happens to silvermane when RBD is mad
0oh lawdy
Closet teim?
Blah
oh, you know I simply 'hate' getting you mad
;)
0sitting down is gonna be painful for you in the near future mr silvermane
I have a facebook as well
0TehDavies on steam (I'm one of the admin peoples in the BMN steam group), RainBroDash here and ponychan (implying I ever actually post there)
(hopes it is for blunt damage and not piercing damage)
0and i guess xbox is irrelevant since, you know, xbox is trashcan.... ;_;
I'm Polarfire over on equestria daily
XD
0BAHA xD the damage was intended to be blunt
I post as SilverMane on EQD
0I don't post on EqD it's just my information source
yeah I don't post a lot.
as in comment on threads
but I do use that name.
usually after reading a great fic
0I really should, just realised :/
0as a tribute to the great fic
either of you on Facebook?
inb4 Cupcakes music video
Naah
I'm not big on facebook.
it's gotten a decent Brony community lately, even a few groups for us
0yarp, but I don't really mix RBD with real life things. I know some pretty intolerant people. So far everyone I know who knows about the ponies has flipped their shit at me : /
interesting.
Me too.
I don't mix RL and ponies.
0the only place I do is steam
i only have my RL account on FB, so I keep it under wraps as best I can
0but that's because only my hardcore bros are my friends on steam
0silvermane same
my family is... mostly clueless so far, although they are starting to wonder why my 'friends' pony bag is still there
My family is totally clueless.
0i mean, as long as the people I add aren't stupid and don't post ponies on my facebook wall, I don't mind adding bronies on fb
0just saiyan
nah, typically i've only seen them posted on walls named after the mane cast/background ponies
0my family isn't around much, I practically live home alone xD
0ftw
lucky
lucky, i never get true alone time during the day
0extremely
0... come to RBD's house
0we have chicken
I be hidin out in mah room
ok
I like this plan
where be RBD's house
I will.
I'll have to ocean hop
XD
0just swim
0it's only in England
0man up
oh is that all XD
I can make it in.... 10 seconds flat.
Can I just walk to Greenland and swim to iceland?
0DO HO HO
then ferry over?
0silvermane do it
I like that idea better XD
I live in michigan, so I'm near the Canada border
0just walk, swim, ferry
0it's cool
I'm in shit fuck texas
well, I set out leaving home tonight with the goal of getting out of my house to recover and finding someone to talk to.I think I succeeded
oooo, Texas brony?
yep
no bronies down here except me hardly.
0SilverMane in all honesty. If you ever need a bro to talk to, talk to RBD.
0add me on skype or something
me too I'm always up for talkin.
0TALK TO POLARFIRE
0:3
I like the herd.
about problems and stuff.
0talk to RBD and polargire
0polarfire

0>:3
ok! I'll probably be on every night around 8 or so till however late I need to stay up.

I'll get on when I remember
0i keed, i keed. show up whenever
Ok.
c ya
0 140lbs
0how much is that in stone i wonder D:
0you crazy USAs with your mathemamatics
Bye bye silver and thanks I had fun tonight.
in stone? about 7 stones
0fair xP
lol
it's about 20lb to the stone. for kg, I'm more like 170 I think...
0oh wait lol
wiat
0it's 14 lb to the stone, duh oh yeah xD
0we measure in stones and lbs.
0im dumb
06erm
what? you brits and your units XD
06can anyone here connect to Lugia.us?
I don't use stones ever, and I got kg and lb backwards apparently
06it says "account suspended"
i'm more like 63 kg
0 14 pounds in a stone
o_O
so I'm 10 stones. but you know I act like I got 40!
i'm on ocean.lugia.us atm
06no
06i mean the site
oh
hmm
06http://www.lugia.us
0I'm 11 stone, but I recently lost like 16 pounds *hero flex*
..
didn't pay the host
dang.
enough
gratz?
0I went from chubbeh to average, ftw.
06hm, possible :/
I'm just 150 or so.
gratz
0ty :>
so we are all healthy for our presumebly 5'10 frames
0tubby RBD is no more, and RBD is pleased.
good job RBD
0something like that xD
i haven't been on the forums lately..
so idk what's up
0I have imba self control at the moment
06me neither
Pones have given me self control recently over a... ehem, more innappropriate habit of mine... ehem
0the key is a heroic sense of being insanely and overly cocky and self confident, without due reasoning.
0hah silvermane, clopping is perfectly fine to talk about xD
I'm 6 ft 150 plus or minus 2 or 3 lbs.
lawl, but it's weird to talk about being down to once every few days, if not once a week
0and at first I thought I'd seen a slight reduction in that when I first started watching teh poni, but then I realised I was lie.
Silver, I can honestly say I have clopped less since I started ponies.
Way less.
0i haven't. WOO Exception that proves the rule!
maybe it's because we have something to do on the internet. so when we get bored, we ALWAYS have something to do
0Well, actually probably less. But I still do it like once a day because I'm bored a lot
0ftw
I used to every night, now i'm down to about once every 2 weeks.
And It's still declining.
0HEY now you guys get to imagine RBD fapping before he goes to bed, fun
0GRATS
alright, this conversation got more awkward than when we were tying each other up and eating syrup
lol
(I was syrup(
0epic win. it's the sleep deprivedness
0it drives me crazy
0i apologise
it's cool bro, peace you two.
0peace
peace
ttyl
ttyl

06To some people at least
06what
I dunno could be possible though, "bronies" have been around a lot longer than 4chan.
What
13:/
13Don't get me started on them again
Since "brony" has always been a term for MLP fans, as long as MLP has existed.
80% of bronies are not creepy
06Well, this guy was certainly not one of those who had been around longer than from when FiM started :P
Although it used to be just male MLP fans.
the 20% creepy are people like Luke Allen
/me gets back to 3DS
That even normal bronies laugh at oO
06But the 20% feel like 200%
Maybe he knew people who had been around that long. :P
What.
Yeah, and 99% of this channel cares about pronies
I'm not creepy
erm
pornies
ponies
..
fffffffffffff
LOL
I see intentional typo
13Brony is still a stupid title for an MLP fan, IMO
06This guy
06did NOT
it's 1:30am
06fall under that category
x.x
Yeah I know, I agree with you, probably an idiot, just saying it's possible.
06whatsoever
What.
OK
Reason accepted as valid
most people are idiots
:p
06And I never ever heard of the word brony before FiM came around
Most = >6.7999 billion people
13^
i'm pretty srue that 90% of the internet doesn't have intellgeince of
er
o_o
Yeah, it became popularised because of FiM.
blah
can't spell
That'
true
s how you survive on the internet
Be stupid
If you are smart you are kickbanned
Or stuff
06o.o
Too smart, that is
You need to have stupid and smart in about 40:60 or 30:70 proportions
If you are like 100 stupid or 100 smart
Bye bye

You believe those lies? The cats wrote that explanation.
You read too much conspiracy theory books
There is no Area 51
It does sound like rubbish though.
There was no UFO crash in Roswell
"but what's really happening is that turning its head reduces the energy going out through its airway, so the bark turns into a meow."
There are no aliens in USA
Does my voice change when I turn my head to the side?
Nope.
LIES!
You try it
My voice changed a little
I did try it.
Nothing.
hello
Try turning all thge way
Until you are like straining
Yeah, nothing.
Well
My voice stays exactly the same.
Cats != humans

Wrong
They don't provide any reasoning for why turning the head magically changes the sound produced.
cats = ponies

"but what's really happening is that turning its head reduces the energy going out through its airway, so the bark turns into a meow." Oh yeah, the other thing is that it turns back away from the person and is still meowing, the meow doesn't turn back into a bark when the cat turns it head back. This is wrong. :P
It evolved from even earlier times

I love how next weeks B movie is the exact oposite of a B movie
orly
ya rly
nowai
yawai
hoshiz
6That movie got a 2.6/10 on imdb... it's B.
6TWO. POINT. SIX.
No, a B movie does not equal a bad movie
a B movie is a movie with a low budget
Battlefield earth had a huge budget
6Our definition of B movie differs from the normal definition of it.
technically a B movie could be good
Then call it something else >.<
6Eeeeeeeeeeenope.
But it's the complete opposite
6It's a big-budget movie that was a huge flop.
Ahh It's like I have OCD
for B movies
...Maybe I have OCD
6And we're looking to find a better name for the movie themes. So deal.
I'm not going to be here next week anyway. I would be there to complain though
Too bad I'll miss the godfather though
Even though I've seen it plenty of times
I'm going to miss al my BMN bronies
and my insomnia
6I don't even properly sleep anymore.
6I sleep for like, 2-3 hours and I'm good for another day or two.
wish I could do that
I'm the exact opposite of that. I need to sleep

13Lol that's the one spellcard I don't have a trick for |D I've always had trouble with that one too
02;-;
13I usually start it off by going behind Mokou whilst there aren't many bullets on the screen
13then try my best to dodge left to right as the bullets get more dense
13I normally bomb my way through it |D

03...
03really?
07nope :'D

03that's also on my list
07I've seen parts of the first ones of both
07that's it
03inb4 Neo going "woah"

07I've just been too lazy since I don't like watching movies at home lol
07too many distractions

03have your own 3D cinema
Never seeing LoTR or the first Matrix film is still pretty bad though.
LoTR = Lord of the Rings?

i found those films way past boring
Meh, to each their own.

the puzzles were so difficult on the Simple Machines Forum based board I tried to register at it took three attempts
Because people are idiots and decide to make it difficult lol
well you can't do much above and beyond what is normally there
by default it's not hard
but people install mods that just suck
vBulletin is expensive but its the most powerful forum software out there
lots of nice features for moderators and staff members
along with a good number for the normal users
not to mention social integration and arcades
12and for a price
munnie$
Simple Machines Forum does not have crap in comparison
its bare bones
indeed it is
but still
EWW SIMPLE MACHINES FORUM
Not everyone has the money for vBulletin
your choice
SMF > PHPBB though
PHPBB...urgh
12Ew people that copy drf by saying eww everything they don't like
the administration panel made me shat brix
if I had the choice between Simple Machines Forum or no forum at all
I would pick no forum at all
It's their choice
lol
I like SMF
have you tried SMF 2?
it's a lot better
noforum=nocommunity
what "improvements" does it offer
02NS :<
because maybe I will change my mind
12SMF 2 is pretty awesome. I don’t find it easy to code though
Well
It's a lot nicer-looking than the previous SMF
The previous SMF was kinda old-looking IMO
12Very true
what improvements are there besides asthetics
it has some pretty nice features and it's also more user-friendly
are the over the top puzzles gone?
The over the top puzzles were mods that people installed
by default it's only a pretty simple just letters puzzle
ohaidere
02No one asked you
just like what I have seen with PHPbb, Proboards, and vBulletin
Pretty much
But don't tell me that you prefer PHPBB
._.
I don't
I even did not like Proboards
despite a forum I read quite a bit being based on it
12lol Proboards
proboards is crappy
o.o
12All I can think of when I hear the word Proboards is free hosting
._.
which is basically it
02lolforumotion
the forum on Proboards was oddly enough left to me and I wanted it off of there
02Ohwait
forumotion is actually decent for a free forum host
Well, it used to
before it forced all that sh*t on its users
02Like what? .-.
12So many advertisements though
The admin panel was easy to use although it wasn't that configurable
Yeah, the advertisements
We used to be able to limit them to guests only
or even disable them at one point, which I did
o-o
And it stayed that way for a while because they didn't realise
then I checked a year later, and kaboom, advertisements left and right
04o-o
02wb
04Not back
04In fact I'll be away for a while
04Just waiting for some friends to get here

/me cries
04What did you want to show me?
02Nothing important .-.

Why Aren't I on there? :P
7Could you stretch your time slightly back? :P
7Since you're a few hours later than most of us?
7And HML; did you give me the time?
7And did I check that you played TF2? O_o
I should move the TF2 server soon
I'm only 1hr ahead of EST
XD
7No, like, actual time.
Ah :P
7I'm mostly open on weekends from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM EDT.
7And HML: so you do play TF2?
no
Nope
And never will
7Then I don't need your times.
I thought this was some kind of random chat thing
7This is to find the best time for a community game. :P
I see :P
7Collecting peoples' times for no reason? O_o
Yeah
I do?
/me flees

Argh, still no one here!
That's cool
All those wasted nights...
As the blood slowly filled the goblet, as the breathes last escaped her cold lips, as the rise and fall of her chest ceased to come, eternity came to her.
Yeah
Darkness slowly fell, and the light fled her eyes, those soulful orbs turning to glass.
You guys need an IRC again D:
We do :D
Make a channel here >|
irc.synirc.net #tsi
oh lol synirc
why synirc?
I dunno, it was there before and we just kept the tradition I guess
'Good night, my angel. Sweet dreams.' A voice rang out, echoing into the distance.
hm okay
The peaceful night, quiet and warm, was disturbed only by the quiet sobs of one who has felt the greatest of joys, and was blessed to witness its end.
She turned, grasping the small cup close to her breast, and walked off, leaving her truest friend to nature, so that she may be returned to the earth.
'With this, you shall live on, in me, and everyone who ever knew you. The world shall never forget the name of...' her voice trailing off, words failing her as her lips trembled in grief.
The next day, as dawn broke, only she was aware of what had happened.
Only she knew the crimes of the prior night, only she knew what had been lost, and only she knew the course destiny has set before her.
12Back
12wbs
The memories of the last few years, times of love and joy, fear and pain, blessed innocence and jubilant wickedness, filled her mind.
12
12*Thanks
I'm bored now. Have fun with this, if anyone is actually going to come on and find it.
/me snores on NS
12lol
02WHY I'M SO BORED... IN SUMMER ;_;

hi
02Hiya
Hi, Polar
Hey!
How are you this evening?
Do I know you?
Od do you remember me?
02!shinyphone
and I'm great. Thanks!
/me runs
Were you here during one of the movie nights?
02I only have one script and that's !shinyphone
Yes. the last 2 i think.
ah, so have I
02:<
cool :D
I'm just not very talkative during them
02Sorry you can't have any of mine.
12My only script is @Kyubey
o-o
i want a !takeforawalk script
yeah me neither. chat is crazy during the movies.
yeah
Its impossible to actually talk
12Good idea
indeed
02lol
02I have no idea how to script scripts
!Shinyphone
You must give me a nick to talk to and something to say. Syntax: !shinyphone <nick> <text>
:P
everyone's making silly comments about this, that, and the other thing
so has RBD been here?
and yes
they are
02~
he's online, but must be afk
12XD
Cute :)
/me tosses Shiny a stick
ah.
/me bites stick and runs off with it
/me chases Night
probably sleepin XD
I know he was tired yesterday.
/me gives Shiny stick after trying to eat it
12:3
o-o
02:E
So what brings you here barry?
02So I watched that new FairlyOdd Movie last night
/me runs
02And then I found Jurassic Park, which saved my life
haha !shinyphone
You must give me something to say. Syntax: !shinyphone <nick> <text>
I remember that script
02Umbreon wants a !takeforawalk script
02Or maybe just !walk because !takeforawalk sounds like a lot of typing
on *:TEXT:*!walk*:#: { if ($strip($1) == !walk) { if ($2 == $null) { describe $chan takes $nick for a walk! } else { describe $chan takes $2- for a walk! } } }
that should work
:p
or are you afk too XD
02Just copy and paste that?
02I want a random chance of me biting them in the leg >|
/me flees

03ever had a problem with IE9 not having the compatibility view button?
Erm, nope O.o
03and for some reason all sites have this odd black bar to the right of the scrollbar which screws the pointer up
03hm
I haven't used IE9 for a while
03I upgraded it from IE8 (inclued with 7) to 9
As I'm always on my laptop
Weird then o.o

03ooh
uuuuuuuuuuuh
why do you want it?
ftw?
12To use it as a base for other scripts
03wtf
._.
03it says sucks.com is already registered
03but it doesn't actually do anything
03odd
12You should also buy o3o.net
03why don't you do it
12and o3o.com
on *:TEXT:*!pokemon*:#: { if ($strip($1) == !pokemon) { %color = $rand(2,15) | msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a $chr(03) $+ %color $+ $read(pokemon.txt) $+ $chr(03) $+ ! } }
that's the old script
03but
03that sucks
12Thanks
03on *:TEXT:*!apple*:#:{
03msg $chan $read colors.txt $+ EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW $read apple.txt
03}
pokemon.txt goes in C:\Documents and Settings\%USER%\Application Data\mIRC
03because that way
nah
03you can use colors.txt and put the LIST OF ALLOWED COLORS *cough*
that's bloated
03also rofl application data
03I keep mine in C:/sysreset
because mIRC takes longer to read from a .txt file than using vars
03soZ?
03-Z
03it's not like the script really lags.
it lags the script more :p
and besides
my folder is big enough
without having more .txt files
I don't want to search through it
03one text files covers all the randomscripts though
03but w/e
you can cover it in one line too :p
!pokemon
03per script
03OW MY EYES
Besides
03see what I mean
the !pokemon script is complicated
at least the new version
12night all
12~
03you know what you can do
03wait no
12Good night
03shoot
03because of the colors
03I was going to say
03store it like "A Blastoise" in the text file
03so that you can do "an Exeggcute" etc
03but that would mess up the colors :/
nope
a %color $+ Blastoise
because $read can parse the % in the file as well
03wait
03you can actually put that in the text file?
Yes
03holy crap
and besides
I am NOT going through the list of 600 or so pokemon
and add a/an in front
03then let me do
03*do it
I could script it anyway
03just don't question if you get it back with no gen 5s
I don't need to do it
/me hides
lmfao
they're separated
03oh
03OK
pokemon1.txt, pokemon2.txt, etc.
03can I replace everything in gen5 with "stupid creature"?
lmfao
03I want to
03so badly
you'd just have to
replace the file
pokemon5.txt
03yeah
12Just do it to the ice cream pokemon, drf :D
03no
lol
03because they all suck
you should see the part
?
03ugh
where the !pokemon script parses identifiers and such in response to the !setgen script
03brb reboot
so it gets the correct lists
that part is like 4 lines
but god damn
12How do I make the .txt file, NS?
put each pokemon/new variable on a new line
so it's like
pokemon1
pokemon2
pokemon3
etc.
12Ah
in the text file
12Sounds easy
yes
that's the easy part
"sounds"
it is easy though
the original script was pretty damn simple
the current one is not
Yes I've been on for a while
msg $chan $nick $+ , you are a  $+ %color $+ $read(pokemon $+ $mid(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ],$rand(1,$len(%pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ])),1) $+ .txt) $+ .
That's just to print out the pokemon
12o-o
Good
after everything has been parsed
Overcomplicated much? :P
not particularly :p
it basically concats the numbers
12So I just put the .txt file in my mIRC folder?
then uses $mid to select one
yes

A;sp readini/writeini would probably have been simpler than using vars.

it uses writeini/readini to write the settings for each user to a file

gen2=on
03anyway
gen3=off
03off to bed
etc.
seeya drf
and then the script parses that before printing out the pokemon
there's a while { line
So why does it use individual user vars in that part?
that does that
!say !testscript
well, in case the script is used more than once
!testscript

I am!
lmao
ohaidere
That doesn't seem necessary.

perhaps not

I'm a Brokenstar! Brilliant!

UGH, w/e NS
DLL debugging is being a b***********
lmfao
UMADmads, that's why I don't do DLL debugging :p
I wish I didn't do it either. rofl :(
The first step is acknowledging the problem
heh
guess this is what I get for mixing like three languages into one program lolol
lmfaao
Try doing C++ classes
NS, how bout i just not listen to ANYTHING you say instead >_>
This program runs on a C# UI with C++ and Lua stuff under it.
<3<3
All written by me, but they aren't exactly integrating well. XD;
They worked fine separately.
You don't want to listen :p
How about listening to what someone else has to say for once?
but connecting them all causes things to go "LOOOOLLL (°Дo)???"
hmmmmmmm
haha UMADmads
dlls are annoying as crap
Baby so hawt
and I haven't done C# or Lua
No. NS, I can't be forced to listen to ANYONE
I don't usually like C# but it's decent for building quick UIs.
If you want people to stop laughing at you and thinking you're annoying, then listen
And Lua is one of the most badass scripting languages out there.
C++ classes are a bit cryptic
If you don't, then by all means, continue with your arrogant attitude :p
e_o
in java, you can do x extends why
And it works well with C/C++ stuff.
*y
Never even heard of Lua.
java is annoying
What's wrong with java?
12lol
debugging java makes me want to go back into C++
x-x
I like java. :o
I speak C++ almost more fluently than English, so I dunno what y'all mean by cryptic. XD;
It's just annoying
c++ runs faster tho
<3.=.<3
it's good for some things
and java has more bugs than my garden does
Lawl.
but java has inbuilt libraries for UI and graphics
True
so does VB
Eww
:(
but VB is windoes-onry
C++ is my bishie.
>>
yeah
Lua's getting there.
VB is easy
I prefer python and C
;3
C#, not really but I'm forcing myself to get used to it lol
again NS, i dont give a crap what YOU say
drf was trying to made a tag stripper UI in VB? and he gave up
I heard C# was less powerful, or slower than C++.
Only word I saw in that was "stripper"
But you should at least listen and maybe take a hint
You don't have to do what I say
Plus, you're not very good with advice regardless.
C# is like Java, but made by microsoft
But at east drop your cocky attitude :p
^.=.^ *wicks*
You'd be surprised, lol
C# is slower than C++ 'cause it's managed. But it's faster and easier to build stuff with.
I dont have to NS
C# sounds dodgy :p
wha?
I only use it for making UIs because I hate programming UIs. lol
I also herd C# is "java done right"
It gets 'em done quickly.
But that's what a suggestion
is
I also herd "QT is easy to learn"
Licks
heh, QT is decent
I like it more than C
Microsoft asserts that C# is better than Java, but honestly I don't give a damn. lol
12Actually, NS seems to be pretty good at advise giving XD
but C is more powerful
derp
GL, like i give a crap
C and C++ are my primary languages and I'm stickin' to 'em.
What's Lua like? I haven't heard of it before.
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
At least I would be if this DLL would quit being a friggin jackbrat.
Heh, UMADmads, I like C more
C++ makes me want to go back to COBOL even
or FORTRAN for that matter
*cries*
:X
COBOL is horrible XD
well NS, I dont
I suggest that you calm down and actually look at the bigger picture
Right now you're not taking reason at all
The syntax of it's pretty easy to get, and it's fast and easy to integrate too.
why should i
Ah, sounds good.
You're blinded by your feelings
>>
Am or was?
shh
idk to be honest
I meant that as an analogy
I'm in the process of using it to build a game HUD that can be modified during gameplay. It's coming along rather smoothly :D
UGH
just w/e
Nice, UMADmads
I dont care, nor will i care.
I haven't done proper programming for months
*lick*
*licks?*
And treat you the way they do
You're just so stubborn and your refusal to change and listen to others is what annoys people
Stubbornness is not going to help, and never will
nor is your trolling
I'm not trolling
You DO troll
stop lying
its annoying
thenagain, there are loads of people here that won't change their ways about something
I do troll, but I'm not trolling
yes, you troll alot
and people need to change
like you
So what? All awesome people troll. lol
12Advise! =Trolling
lmfao
you need to be nicer for one
stop trolling 2nd
I fail to see how she isn't being nice right now. rofl
not be so fking blunt all the time
I am honestly at a loss of what to say to that lol
I don't know whether to laugh or cry with laughter
is this discussion going anywhere ?
Not that I can see. lol
You ARENT
And I don't troll
STOP FKING LYING
that much
But I'm getting a kick out of it all the same.
you're never nice
at all
What about now? lol
you arent
How am I not being nice?
you constantly disrepect me
Lol, that doesn't answer my question
How am I not being nice?
bloody fck i gave you an answer
And I do respect you, just not when you're being stupid
Yes, and that answer is?
yeah right
Answer?
you never had one ounce of respect the moment ive arrived here
you treat me and a few others like crap :P
lol, your view of me saddens me )':
Honestly, I do sometimes, I know that
really now?
But that doesn't mean I don't have respect
07oi, removing one letter from a swear word doesn't make it ok to use here
lmao Kyu
You should be saying that to me >:
07o3o
hey, I AM being nice right now
yeah right
Notice SS
I don't understand how I'm not being nice lol
she isn't the one swearing.
XD
lmao
*Sigh*
06what
07a person can't say whether they're nice or not, it all depends on the opinion of others lol
That's true
and i've heard others opinions about her
But I don't see anyone else saying I'm being mean, unless you are :p
people tell me things >>
I know people don't like me
12I think NS is being perfectly nice rofl
derp
07I'm saying if someone's thinking you're being mean, then that doesn't mean you're being nice
07I'm not saying either
07=P
lol
06<UMADmads> So what? All awesome people troll. lol <- I can't say anything else than this but
06The stupid burns D:
Heh
He can at least tell me how I'm being mean right now
07and more importantly
06trolling because it's awesome is like swearing because it's edgy and hardcore
07!espeon

/me hides
07well, you're being blunt
The fact remains I could be more blunt
07and being blunt is the mean version on being truthful
07=P
06And while it's not always needed
06sometimes it is
I'm being truthful and not completely blunt :p
pony...
07i.e, that dress totally does not make you look fat
07at all.
07:'D
lol
lmfao
I thought bluntness was determined by how few words you used. lol
hahaha
07well
07that too
Kyu, sometimes being blunt is the only way that works :p
And I'd prefer to tell people the truth rather than dodging around the topic
And reasonably, I'm not exactly being THAT blunt either

I'm not awesome enough to use Linux unlike someone else :(

I prefer linux because it's not as bloated as windows :p
fair enough lol
and of course, compiling isn't as hard :D
inb4: ubuntu
ew ubuntu
xD
06That's a reason that actually makes sense
06xD
XD
I had Fedora on Morgana for a while but never figured out how to do anything XD;
/me too lazy to research stuff
ubuntu is like the linux version of windows
if that's possible to explain
I herd fedora is very cutting-edge
fedora is apparently getting better
lol did I tell you about the time I went into and apple store and put ponies anthrology on all the ipads?
haven't tried 15, and the last one I tried was 14
like. lots of updates, all the time
ubuntu has a lot of updates .-.
Yeah, they release a new version every what, six months?
You did me
yeah they do
But your probably talking to him so ima go away
fedora has crap integration with its desktop environment
which annoys me
I still have the disc of F14 in case I wanna go back, but I dunno. I'd have to set aside the time to learn it lol :(
I prefer linux mint 9 for personal use
and I'd rather be doing code. :P
well, linux mint in general
haven't tried 11 and 10 is meh
Haha
it's so much easier to code on linux
because compiling doesn't require you to explode
boom
XD
Nah
I like how Microsoft's threaded compiler locks up your computer though. rofl
Both of you
That's how you can tell Microsoft made it.
you literally can't do anything while it's running XD
rofl that
I go to compile
and then realise too late it does that
then fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
i've got an old version of gcc & c++ for windoz

I'm pretty open about my fandom, no one questions it, which worries me

I don't get the ponies.

It's just the best cartoon around at the moment, so some people like it.
My sister bought all the ponies and styled their hair exactly like the show
zagging vaginaz
Like, obsessively
No pony toys in the UK.
theres gotta be some in the UK, i know a guy from there who has a Princess i forgots her name thing :p
Celestia.
She's probably pink though.
yeah that
Because Hasbro sucks at Celestia.
yeah
XD
I was more talking about the main 6.
And if he has a Celestia toy he probably ordered it from another country.
Because MLP FiM only just hit the UK on the 4th of July.
Dari, are you there?
Eeyup.
I want Nightmare Moon figurine
I will go nuts over it
What, like the guy in the video you linked?
Do you know the order of the movies we are watching this week? I want to change the site and send out the email update.

Oh, and did you MLP buses in Mexico?
PHOENIX.

PHOENIX PHOENIX PHOENIX PHOENIX PHOENIX.
you see the**
Hasbro does advertises on buses in Singapore
Someone already updated the site I think.
I saw a bus with an advert for Nerf Guns
Probably Sprinkles, I know he added a countdown timer to the next stream.
and Nerf Guns are made by Hasbro
That's kinda cool
Next: My Little Pony Friendship is Magic
WITH NERF GUNS?!??!??!??!?
Yeah?
You know how some Austrian web sites were hacked and then plastered with Rainbow Dash pics?

You missed the auto-spammer.

LOL spam a empty chat.
7Saywha?
6God..what was that for?
12and the Fire Temple
12because you saw what happened when you fall

Oh wow.

12where you HAVE to precariously run
12around a hole
6It is..
12that'll send you to the bottom of the Temple if you fall
12and you're timed
12Farore's Wind would allow you to warp back up there if you fall
6SR ftw! xD That'd be epic :3
12(tho it costs a bit of Magic Power)
i forgot wheres Zora's domain .-.

Apparently the original version was pretty poorly written (bad grammar, spelling), which would have killed it for me.

To be honest without the puns it'd be pretty boring.

Would YOU love a taste of my Auto-bot?

I like Decepticons better
Sweet lawd.
I like ponies more.

4I was watching Batman through the entire thing

12<3
Why can't you listen.

ohi.
05I didn't relise the long XD
(Won't you..)
12FINALLY able to get the eevee event thing on the global link =P
05And the Link part
What about floofEevee?
4Cuz you touch yourself
That's not enough.
13Eww
How do I switch to my regular name?
just the typical /nick?
/nick <newnamehere>
yup.
ok
hmm
not letting me switch
stuck on Alt =/
LOL
13You grabbed my ass
Whee
if there's no password you just have to wait for your old nick to ping out.
I have a lot of nightmares.
Ok
So what does that do?
Now you can switch back to your old nick.
It does some internet magicks.
and makes things work.
awesomeness
03y
it's the equivalent of kicking a microwave to make it work properly.
And sometimes, I can feel the pain
Very bad but funny pun
except with half the risk of getting your foot stuck in it and microwaved along with your chili.
lol
10Bah
That's funny because I had chili for dinner
10I read Link and long next to each other
I know. :o
10Bad images in my head
*were
6@ Dari : where's the thing in the picture?
lol
There is no lake.
Long link
o.o
I'm always too lazy to ghost my nick. I just wait for it to ping out.
how does it ping out?
6o.o Cliff ftw?
Internet magick.
13Oh I see it now
If you look at this you'll realise, then look back.
Any idea why it forced us both to switch our names?
Server tries to check if your nick is alive, and if it gets no response after X amount of time, it pulls the plug.
ok
makes sense
LMAO
Ghost is just a way to accelerate the process.
What sky sees as bad images, LL sees as paradise with Link
You don't take the time to understand me. You never had, all you do is judge for what I do, when you should be looking for what I am INSIDE.
/me RUNS
10Truth
6xDDD
hmm
I'm not actually sure why it happens, but sometimes nicks just get randomly lost and you reconnect with an alternate one.
Internet magick is not always stable :(
D=
6If you wanna be accepted and understood here,how the hell does the spamming help?
it is known to go horribly awry
hopelessly at the mercy of Al Gore's whims.
4oh my god
Like stripping plasma's protons away
12XD
*no comment *
4I cannot believe how much emo bullshit I am hearing
6xD
quite.
05Long Link O.O
Long link with his massive sword
/me RUNS
I used to be that way, not anymore.
13Your actions refect who you really are dipshit
6Anyways...I htg..
your humor is awesome, you know
13*reflect
4It makes fucking Cloud look like he rides unicorns and sings all day
6See you guys soon..
6If anything good happens please screenie :3
6Bai,,
thank you good sir.
Cya.
12<3
you're welcome
our neighbors just got back from their 3 week vacation in Florida
12a sword so long he needs two hands to, *ahem* handle it~
they had a good time, but they said it was very hot
They should've brought me with them.
LMAO
lol
10Ohmy
/me RUNS LIKE HELL
05Oh dear
IDK how you'd like Italy
or if
Probably more than Florida.
Link mah boi
at least the pizza is good
and the Coca Cola
i.e., everything.
:(
If there's more to life than pizza and Coke then I've yet to discover it.
I had some good pizza at a restaurant in Idaho
At a mostly Montana chain
I call a truce.
12|3
Is Montana really a place?
4I call an eviction
I think so
I thought they were just like "hey, we need a name for this void between here and Canada"
I think it's more like acquired land
exactly
the western half is cool, the eastern half is excessively boring
it's the kinda state where you'd want to own a fast car
lol, I can imagine.
speed limits on the main highways are 80 MPH and there are no cops
Long highways with nothing to run into.
65 in construction zones xD
rofl
05http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMjAhbjqnj0
/me runs from the squeals
13Reminds me of Dotm Megatron:We need a truce, after all your nothing without me. Optimus prime:*rips megatrons head off with an axe*
there are a lot of fast cars and rich people in Florida
but then there's also a very high rate of homelessness and poverty
lol
And college kids and old people.
the state with both extremes
but you knew I'd say that. lol
My magstripe reader = awesomeness
would you fall into the only possibly applicable one?
What are you doing with it?
I copied my staff id to a starbucks gift card
haha
LOL
jared licks my penor
they will be all like wtf when i show up.
That's quite cool.
I dunno actually, considering I'm not in college anymore.
nuhuh
uhhuh
you're just sorta there?
Im going to copy my bank card to a starbucks card too
yup.
just for more wtfs
lookin for a way and a reason to gtfo.
you have the reason
heat, traffic, tourists
though honestly the way things are going in the short term
I might have a job here in town in a few weeks XD;
ok
cool, maybe
which is partly cool because I'll ya know
have a job
what kind of job?
but it sucks because well, yeah.
any other suggestions for funness?
Programming military training sims.
wow
I hope to be able to design roller coasters and other thrill rides
I got to see their equipment and stuff the other day.
maybe work for a big design firm or a manufacturer
Wasn't allowed to take pictures but it was pretty mind blowing XD
wow
I could imagine
Does anyone know how to make a Thrash Metal melody w/ Drums in FL Studio?
my dad's in the Navy, that's why we're here
I have family in the Army, but that's not why I'm here lol
13Nope
brb, I need some milk
No one wants to make emo music.
I came here for college alone, and then this company comes shooting in
from Honolulu of all places
and they're looking for programmers.
It's not "emo".
so I figure why not lol
02so much black D:
I take offense to that you racist >:(
/me shot
back
02DDDDD:
I can't believe I just chugged down a whole glass
02now, I need to fix something
I had to get another half glass for some enjoyment lol
I do that a lot lol
02there.
02:3c
and then I wonder why milk never lasts in my house XD
milk never lasts in my house
my doctor took the awesomeness out of milk
told me to switch to skim because I love it too much D=
05Uh, 4Chan for that, guys>
lolol
I've never had problems with mi-
nevermind I definitely did
in the past
I dunno if I used to be allergic to it or what lol
we finally started drinking Lowfat, but he wanted us to go further
then one day I decided I hated not drinking milk.
so I started drinking it again
thanks to milk, I've never broken a single bone
and all has been well ever since.
4Yeah it is
4cuz you made it
whats the mode to limit the amount of lines per second from a user in your room
nomm
y
?
lol, I've never broken a bone because I'm always in a seated position and never doing anything active.
XD
xD
That'd almost be the case for me
except for the fact that I've played basketball ever since 1st grade

I've played a grand total of
0 sports
'cept if sleeping's a sport. I'm pretty pro at that.
I slept a marathon this weekend too.
I'm good on some nights, but worse on others
I had really bad insomnia about a month ago lol
That was fun.
oh my
It's the equivalent of a broken leg in any other sport.
I've had insomnia on some occasions, but not often
I get it pretty often lol :\
Part of the reason I hate being human so much.
If I were just a brain in a jar everything would be fine.
more like 'hard time getting to bed because I just got off of the computer and went straight to my bed'
/me yawns
how could you use MIRC?
D=
Because mIRC is full of win.
I'd have wires that let me use computers. lol
I've heard of that before
hi pd
13lol
heh
My nervous system would be wired into a bunch of machines instead of a body.
3{NiGhTmArE}: your getting booooooooring
there was this woman who (I think) became quadroplegic and had a wire connected to her head that allowed her to use a compuer
he isnt really a nightmare :P
There's also Stephen Hawking. lol
He's getting there.
Electronica? or Breakbeat (Drum 'n' Bass)
is that the guy with the robot voice?
3Figures *goes op on him*
I think you're talking about +f.
Yeah, he can't move any body part except one of his cheeks.
Wow...
+f lines:seconds
that would not be fun
You are ignorant.
and he's a badass physicist.
3How so son?
/me looks up Stephen Hawking
The way you sound/said that.
Hearing text must be a real talent.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LKa1Y9_ok LOL at this
mIRC has text-speak.
Black holes and stuff. He's a smart dude.
/me can hear the text. XD
though you know what's funny to think about
I wonder if he'd have all that robot gear if he were just a regular paralyzed guy
without the IQ of over nine thousand.
hey ppl
yeah
3Yo long time no see
Hey.
10That
just a regular paralyzed person with an interesting way of speaking
10looks like DRF
/me runs
how come the chronicler doesn't want spyro to go to mt. malefor yet earlier he wants spyro too
What the hell is this.
wow, and he's pretty old
man he's shady
LMAO
4Cuz the plot went to hell in that game ages ago
Hyper said the same thing
10Brb
3He wants dat azz
yeah, hope he doesn't kick over anytime soon :(
lol chronicler has a passage to mt malefor
haha
he's a pedo
I haven't heard much of him recently

lmfao
Worth playing.
drf has to see this
/me runs
did anyone see the fairly odd movie?
3Nah
it was pretty good
05Lol
especially the cgi
Like how Tama is "the first cat to hold a managerial position at a train station."
4I turned it off after 10 min
4god
not normally the kind of thing cats aspire to.
4I ahted it
lol
My sister watched it, i saw it for a few seconds and hated it
/me wonders what kind of aspirations his cat has
I guess thats unfair but still
My cat aspires to
exist
so far it's not coming along too well sadly :(
3Suinide: WHat did I tell you about talking out of turn?
D=
Not to...
Cats have aspirations?
Oh I forgot, world domination.
Evil cats.
3*slaps* Punk ass kids these days
yes of course. lol
Cats normally aspire to take over the world, so it's odd that one would be content with a train station :(
my cat has the aspiration to sit somewhere where she can be warm
unless it's all a part of her bigger scheme.
absorb the heat
then one day
lol
DR. OCTAGONAPUS BLAAAAHHH@

3Suinide?
I wanna see a cat grow eight arms.
that'd be pro.
Yes?

What about Charizard? =D
Charizard might have some too. :O
He's known for his expertise in being upside down.

7I might have to talk with Rora.
06Next sunday, because then parents are away and such xP
Hipster_Brony: The movie is Clash of the Titans (2010)
06While they do not mind ME staying up late, they just go "oh we can't sleep when you're still up"
06so yeah

7Okay, I'll make note.
8clash of the titans is a B movie
ah
8and i will slap you if you ever pick it
06xD
6Well, Hipster, if it does happen, it'll be coverable.
Hipster
8also, go ahead DCD
What about The Incredible Hulk (2008)

06o.o
10C-c-combo breaker

Just one more question: What would Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker be?
oh sorry I just assumed that when you said "let's hope that doesn't happen during a regular broadcast" you meant something in a current streaming
06:333
8never seen it, so not sure
A-est Movie
8DCD, no, there was a server derp on mibbit's part
=3
8made it so we couldn't log in to our usernames
the YT show that is

So, who all have we actually added to the ranks of moddom?
Just RainBroDash
We've got Metal_Link and sathi having interviews Wednesday.
3:3
And Soarin will be doing a Test Run Friday.
That's sathi
Who is INCREDIBLY qualified.
oh, I see.
And we're still on the fence about Soarin and Dman
Dman...
Oh, i know. She freaking LEADS an online community group.
Soarin is getting a Test Run, as I said.
What about Dman?
And sathi will probably get insta-hired as RBD did.
I wasn't there for Dman's interview, or at least not most of it.
So I have little to say on him.
I see.
...gawd if feels weird to type in white.
I'm glad we'll have at least two sure in mods.
/me is bored
It feels weird to type in black on my end. :P
02.-.
12o.o
Yeah, Metal_Link was unable to show up to his interview last week because somepony at his ISP knocked out his internet for the whole day.
So we're giving him a second chance.
So we'll probably have another hire, and two Trial Runs on Friday.
?

Bad idea
needless to say it's being dumb.
not really
as it's cool
I think it'll be another decade before we switch to IPv6 locally
well
right now I have both

ipv6 eliminates the need for port forwarding <3
What is that </Ineveruseit>
you need it for router

Ah
to be able to use Xbox live and such
That's why XD
I never use online for any consoles, well, maybe
Does the 3DS need forwarding too?
not unless you want fast speeds

I know x.x
LOL HML, you ping more than him
WLM?
Windows Live Messenger
Yeah
It craps
On my laptop
what version
the newest one can go die in a fire
and dont use the excuse that nothing can fix it cause thats what TReKiE can help you with HML :P
I finally got used to v14
v15 or w/e is like IE with chat >_>
And how do you check your version number? XD
help
about
Ah
14
good
you do not want the newer one
it sucks
Yeah
im on 14 as wel
XD
well*
on 7, you have to run it in Vista compatibility XD
you can't get 14 anymore sadly
as it's now Windows Live Essentials 2011 or v15 or w/e
Ew :<
Thank goodness for XP?
it exists on XP
.,.
Cry
Well
well
I refuse to download any Live software anyway
XD
Stupid windows update >.>

I dunno?
/me is confused
Well
I am derping
I mean, the other live software
Like the movie maker
EW WMM

02Sonic Vegas Pro 8 Ftw
02[/late]
EW SONY
02Sony*
EW SONY LAGAS
XD
12wbs Slash
Sony Vegas is awesome
IMO
it's Sony
therefore it sucks
your opinion
ty
no
go google sony rootkits
no.
they have been taken to court for being evil
ignorance is no excuse.
my opinion is the only one that matters to me kthx
02and?
02Who cares
and they lost
02Good Program is good.
no?
dude
Sony was sued for putting viruses on their CDs
now why would I ever trust any Sony software
I don't like viruses tyvm
02and who buy'd those CDs anyway?
i didnt buy Vegas >>
I would
>:(
lots of people
02I pirated SVP8
*cough*Pirated*
EW PIRACY
yay pirating viruses?
Yes :p
>defective by design
yum Jailbreak for something
same with iPods, etc
02yay, pirating and not getting viruses
^
or so you think
you do realize
blah blah blah
good viruses tell your antivirus not to report it
The average iOS has more holes than a unpatched Windows XP os
/me yawns
drf: i dont feel like listening to your opinions, so im gonna kindly ignore your assessments w/o the use of ignore.
right, all I'm saying is Sony = evil, that's not just my opinion
02Soo..... then again, I've had SVP8 since like 3 years
10Meep
02nothing has happened yet to my pc
the only things Sony makes that I like anymore are their cameras
drf, again, You're opinions mean nothing to me, mine only matter to me
and entry grade headphones, but it's kinda hard to get viruses from headphones
The only Sony products I like are their old laptops, TVs? and PS1/PS2
their Trinitron CRTs were awesome
Yeah
Bravia LCDs suck though
and yeah
They're meh
Sony became evil about a year after releasing the PS2
I think all my/most of the LCDs here are Panasonic
YSS
*YEs
drf, would you happen to hate my Panasonic Viera?
Panasonic is like THE best brand of TV
:o
Yay
Pattyrick, read what I just said
I have a DRF approved TV
/me flees
I have a 50" Viera
wow, something I have that you like
nah
OMG!
/me runs
the only thing better than panasonic for TVs is Pioneer
I have two 52in Verias in my house XD
and those are like $4000
HML, plasma?
Yeah
as EW LCDS OVER 42"
good.
my dad got our 48" (I think) for free, thanks to a raffle
Has to be plasma anyway
no
they make 42" LCDs
but they suck
I have a 32" LCD Viera, that one is nice
and a 50" plasma
The largest LCD I have had is a 32 in Panasonic...I think
it may weigh more but plasma is the best thing yet
That one got stolen
:<
Yeah :<
Plus our small 19in kitchen TV
you can have mine if you fly over here and get it
/me runs
But we replaced it with a cheaper and larger LED TV XD
LOL
Forgot the price, but around 350-400$ for a 24 or 23 in XD
bbl class is done
Lol

8was just writing up a text wall on ponychan
6Also, they plugged us. <3
cool
grate, hahaha
I've been playing the same song on my piano for like the past two days.
6Hipster, mod chat?
Hipster, are you a hipster irl or is it just a name/profile?
/me Now Playing: chthonic - Disconnected
12Roara~
8im kind of a hipster
LOL at this, the only OC ReMix i've heard with Yankee Doddle in the song XD
8mostly just in it for the music
so like 50% or less XD
or more
8dunno
8i just do what i like
7Hey, Rora!
12Back
I see.
7About that community game...
8i gave myself the label ironically
7Is the 17th open?
lemme check
work shift from 12:15-5
PST
Ahh, PST
my home time zone
8-.- >mfw people care more about finding out who left than the message of the post
7Hmm, that's workable.
6Eyup.
7You can play after?
do what now?
yeh
I should be able to
8the thread i put on /oat/
7All right.
oh.
I go check it
I see where youre coming from, but that's kinda the first thing that comes to people's minds when they read it.
7Well, my tentative schedule is from 2:00 to 6:00 AM GMT.
7Not all four hours, but depending on who can come.
IMO.
Life is too short to be angry or sad all the time.
good quote
but
Life is too short to be angry or sad ANY of the time.
rawr!
06I'm not sure if I can be there for that =s
8true
7D:
06But TF2 related, going to the official valve servers allowed me to see a funny mix of massive douchebag newbies, elitist "veterans" bashing them and a few cool newbies actually trying to learn.
06It was fun to kind of rally the troops and beat the opposition in a stacked game ;v;
7I can't make it too early or late...
7Unless I change the date.
7But I want the most people to come. :3
06Yeah, timezones xD
12o3o
Why did the two leave? They'll more than likely come back at some point. I don't ponychan a lot.
7Espeon, is that early or late in your timezone?
06well it would be 3:00-7:00 am, wouldn't it? And that combines both late and early :P
lol
7o.o
06But if it was a week later I could probably be there around that time regardless xD
8they both got frustrated with the site
8with the negativity
7Okay...
7Eh, Rora, how's a week after?
8with the constant drama
8although i hope and pray he will
um
dunno my schedule for that week yet
I'll have it tomorrow
7Okay.
/me 7asdfs.
/me 6still waiting for dinner to be fin-
:(
6oh it's done
/me 6goes there
7It's partially stressful trying to do this.
7I'd really want everyone to show up, due to how multiplayer it is. XD
06:3
Its just bored bronys being bored. Things'll pick back up again once season 2 info gets out.
meep :o
7Unless you want to do something with bots. >>
I wouldn'y worry a lot about it but I would try not to feed it also.
the negativity and constant drama, I mean.
o_o
Most likely
7The week after, if needed?
Uh
I'll need to move it
But yes, probably
7:|
7Oh.
7Jolly good, then.
When do you need it?
It's been up the entire time
7Either this Sunday or next weekend.
killed itself yesterday so I restarted it
Ah
Well
7Still organizing...
it's up 24/7 anyway
7Thank you.
06<3
8i know him pretty well
8when he became a mod, something changed
06And the more the merrier really, of course to a certain point but I doubt we'll reach that "too many people aaaa"-point :P
7Blah.
7Indeed.
I dont know him at all, so enlighten me.
8in a manner of speaking, the constant negativity drove him insane
8he is completely different
8and im not the only person who has noticed it either
You can't let the internet getcha down :)
but that's still bad.
06hehe
<%Espeon> And the more the merrier really, of course to a certain point but I doubt we'll reach that "too many people aaaa"-point :P
Well server limit is set at 24
:o
or well
I think I put it at 50 actually
not sure
7The max is 32, I think.
8its a community, and it was our home
8he felt like it had changed permanently, and he didnt want to be a part of it anymore
06I think 32 is the max "recommended" setting anyway :P
Well, I can't remember
well, in the case of a sour community, I think part of it is boredom. There's no new stuff and hasn't been for awhile.
Since I'll be away on the 17th
I'll give Xeli access to the server
/me is watching DBZ
In case he needs to start it up
06And on most maps it would just be a cluster~~~~
7Okay. o3o
It will take more than a group-lead revolution to turn stuff around.
06And alright
Xeli, you'll need PuTTy
7In slang, a 'spamfest'.
Or Linux/unix-based system
Like in your thread, I see a lot of debating and a few people actually doing what you wanted.
06Well I certainly do not have anything linux related
Not trying to be negative.
8this isnt debating
8not by ponychan standards anyway
06putty is like a telnet/something client right?
what episode sneas
`o'
discussion about non-happy stuff then.
8it looks fine to me
12ew DBZ
06But either way, I'll probably manage not to break anything :P

Nope
LOL
/me has no idea either
They are divided into three races
Earth, Pegasus, and Unicorn
Only the Unicorn ones have horns
12Unicorns are just another type of ponies just like Pegasus. LOL
03>implying we care
And magicks

drf: I was curios kthx
Earth are that. No horn, no wings, no magicks
03why be curious about something you don't like?
12K, I can see where this is going
because i learned not to complain about it
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna/Nightmare Moon are the only ones with both wings and horn

Go program a nice IRC client

Changing forum software or some such.
14ah
14okay
ohai May
I think something went wrong with the host
14that's what I thought
If Articuno wanted to disable stuff, I doubt she'd put up a page like that
oh, I thought Arti suspended it on purpose to change it. lol
14has Arti said anything about it?
It'd be forum maintenance mode
Why?
And nope
not that I've seen
ah right. that'd make more sense.
14I don't know, just wondering
/me shrugs
well
I don't know why, I don't know how forums work. XD;
I dunno, I know just as much as you do

03I think that would not end well
Coffee.
02The other chat lol

Coffee is one of the top five things you would put in a trap if you wanted to catch me.
Move to Australia, get bitten by giant spiders.

Arthur
I never really got into arthur :C
hmm
how about magic school bus?
I like how the show seemed more honest about life though like that episode where dw was asking about the swear word and it was a bleep rather than some dumb made up word
never liked msb either
heya Quilava :3
yeah, I remember that episode
Viri was looking for you earlier
how about... digimon?
jk
:P
dragon tales?

yeahh!
hahaha
02he did 1.7m
02I did 1.9 ~
02But he got more Acc ¬¬
sometimes when by dad used to call when he got really drunk he'd be like I WATCHED DRAGON TALES THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT OF YOU........
Oh..
oh wow
yeah, he poked me on MSN
cause sometimes when he was being my part time teacher when he still lived here we'd watch it and imitate it on our break
did you imitate any of the characters, or were you always the same one?

Ffff, nvm
yeah I did hahaha
"rain rain go away" "HURRRR AND DON'T COME BACK"
6He was checking in to see if the chat was still having problems.
6The server we run on was doing maintenance earlier.
haha
NINOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
QUETZEL ITS MY BIRTHDAY AND NO ONE LOVES ME :(
02I wonder how in the hell he got 80.10% acc
Quetzal, that was the main female dragon, right?
02;-;
hm......
Hax?
what was the big one's name?
:P
quetzel was the yellow teacher.........
02I got like 75%, if I remember correctly
oh yeah, it's been a while since I've watched it
I tried that map too....
the big blue one is ord, the pink one is cassie, and the two headed green and purple one is zach and weezy
I commence checkpoints
Like i ever make them......
my sister and I liked Zach and Wheezey the most
me too
03what movie did you watch
wb aurora
6harry potter 5
03oh
I might have a good test for attack and decay in a compressor/limiter
03god you know what sucks Aurora
6that leaves the 6th movie for either tomorrow or wednesday
techno or dance music
02It took me like 200 tries to pass that map
6because both parts for 7 are on thursday
03you know how I said we get to se HP7.2 the night before it comes out
03*?
something with a thumping bass part
03well with my night class
02and another 60 to get that score
03our exam was supposed to be Wednesday
02xD
12HP~
03and the teacher changed it to Thursday night
03>_<
6um
6I thought you were seeing it wedneaday
03so I can't even skip if I wanted to
03so I have to miss out on early premiere...
03no
03thursday
6oh
true
Off to work
this is for a compressor/limiter for audio levels
More jackhammering walls today
there's a pokemon italian dance mix somewherre,
And placing a tube or something.....
2BAM?
Anyways BBL
its for broadcasting to protect from overmodulation on air
03so yeah, Aurora, I'm gonna have to resort to eseing it like Friday or Saturday night
03at least I can see it in the IMAX htat way
ah
/me hugs Quilava too :3
I actually have to attenuate the midrange a bit to prevent voice peaks from distorting
but there seems to be no appreciable consequence if the attenuation is slight
/me np: Barbi Schiller - Misty's Song (Radio Remix) [03:57m/320kbps/44kHz]
I am using this for a test now
/me squeaks
ok
no pumping in the audio
so it seems the separation between the frequency bands in the compressor/limiter stage is wide enough
well, I shoud be getting sleep for work
I have to work early
see you tomorrow probably
alright bye
/me rapes stuff
can rape me.. :P

Well I'm inspired to eat cute things again, so that's nice. I had to stop before because kittens were starting to go extinct.

You're Luka though
And Luka is cute
But you're not a tuna.
Therefore
You need to eat yourself

that's fine

okay, 7 pages after cleaning that crap up
yeah, the email
Thanks gl

Great...
Something happend again?
6You, sir. Are win.
huh?
no
we were referring to that :p
Besides, I don't jump on people just because I can, lol
I just need to set up services now.
DRAKE
Ok....
6Awesome.
Nice email adress.....
Then I can look into writing some server modules, like wordfilters.
Who was drunk again?
On everyone, lulz, etc. XD
:D
6...can you take off the stupid emotes?
6I HATE emotes.
No, that's mibbit.
You can turn them off in mibbit though.
6...FAWK
Just click on the a smiley.
It should turn into normal text.
6:)
6...I love you dari
6:D
Haha, no problem. XD
6:(:/:P:O;)
6:)
6FAWK
6It doesn't stay that way... =(
6Guess I'm stuck using =
6I just like using : for : D
12Well, seeya everyone
Maybe you have to turn each individual smiley face off?
bye GL
06g'd bye GL :
6I do.
6It's dumb.
12Bia
I need to help my mom with something, but I'll be back in a few minutes
6Are you sure you can't write a script for it?
Nah, that's not possible, because it's just something that mibbit does.
Mibbit should have a setting to turn them off though.
Switching to pc....
06yup, back
If you're really bothered you could set up this java SSL proxy, then redirect the places where the mibbit smiley faces are stored on the internet to somewhere on your computer, and have the ones on your computer look like normal smiley faces.
6...ew. Work.
Except they wouldn't have the same colour as your text, they'd be a fixed colour, and other people wouldn't see them like that.
6...ew. Pointless work.
How It Works
see Prefs -> Smileys (main client or widget manager):
Width: The width of the smiley when shown.
Height: The height of the smiley when shown.
Base URL: The common first part for all icons in the URL column.
Code: Mibbit searches for the code of each line of text for this, and replaces it with the picture hosted on the Icon URL.
URL: The second part of the URL to an image that will replace the text found in Code (or a file name if server/path is common for all icons).
You can turn them off then.
6Bleh.
6I want them turned off for everypony, is the thing... *shrug*
That's not possible then.
6Because mibbit is FAIL
6But we've already established this.
Unless I finish making my own client, which I'm too lazy to do.
6lol
6Maybe some day.
I was going to have it so you could play games with other people over IRC, pretty sure no other IRC client does that.
6Maybe some day.
6That. Would. Be. Win.
6Put pony games on it. =D
Story of the blank flanks.
"!!Spike & !!Twilight leaving are the most notable and sad of these changes..."
6You going to be there for the stuff on Wednesday?
They left? O_o
6Yep.
6Yesterday.
Why?
6Dunno.
6Likely all the recent mudfests finally got to them.
6It is a shame though...
6!!Spike even asked to be permabanned with no appeal.
6And was.
That's weird, !!Spike didn't seem like the kind of person to just give up to me, I'd never really seen !!Twilight speak.
6!!Spike had been talking recently, especially to the GETters, about how ponychan was going to hell.
6and !!Twilight always had a short fuse.
6Granted, !!Spike's fuse wasn't exactly the longest, but not nearly as bad as !!Twilight's.
It's just that's all I've ever called the serpent.
So I find it hard to think it could be anything otherwise.
Oh, did you ever get your Applebloom trip Sprinkles?

holy crud

in Cuba I was fine with like
3 to 6 dollar meals
then again everything's state run there so it's all cheap OTL
12i was looking for those kind of meals
and I probably eat less than normal people
12i eat more x-x
even just a HOTDOG?
that's insane
...
12i dunno

Depends on what you want done.

oAo
Oh, nice job
12judging nationals and there was this meeting for judges and stuff and they held it there
6And by flashing rainbow, I mean like !!RainbowDash's name.
I expect I can do that for you. If you don't like it, we can always ask someone else.
12XD
12this was one of those fancy places where they put like napkins in your lap and everything
/me yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawns
Ohai ray
6Gonna put it right under our mane banner on all the pages on Friday, since Friday's Brony Appreciation Day... obviously.
And mmhmm, realy fancy

three types of forks and knives
haha
Imitation Black
why do you sound so cool
If someone would put a napkin in my lap
I would eep
If someone would put a napkin in my lap
I would eat normally
'cause I always do that :D
Yea right....

Switching back to PC

06mmhmm
it's nice to know i have 3D modeling software on my computer now
now the trick is finding time to play with it
06BRB, Dinnerz
YO
again
What program, Roara?
lol
sorry had to restart
I've got DAZ and Bryce now
ah, I've got Maya lol
not that I use it but XD
yeah I was considering maya
but both DAZ and Bryce are legitimately free
so
I got a free copy through my school. :(
plus they're apparently really good software, I've heard of bryce
....lol
I might actually still have a product key you can use.
if you wanna try it.
nah
its ok
k lol
I love deciding to drop out of a contest
and then deciding to go back into it 4 days before the round is over
and i haven't even really started my entry
woot
XD
13Indecisiveness ftw?
^
o3o
drf would hate you, but I'll o3o too just for the sake of it
xD
I'll hate you instead :O
it's one thing for someone to use the face
0__o
it's another for someone to acknowledge that it would get someone mad
and then use it
True
sounds like something I would do.
My trip to Gardaland got cancelled D=
and it was the trip that kept me from going to the TST meet!
XD
My lack of cash kept me from going~
the teen center is incredibly unreliable
speaking of lack of cash
wonder if I'll be able to go to PAX next month...
my incredible distance + lack of csh is keeping me here
stupid
california
nah, I'm pre-exploded.
so I'm cool :d
o3o
My sleep schedule is inverted here, so who knows maybe I'd be fine in GMT XD
if only I could go to that 50's diner in Coronado again...
I almost went to Paris this month too but
jeez I hate being poor.
If I had three wishes I'd spend all of 'em on cash.
ending world hunger can wait.
I wanna travel. :\
brb
why was there so much hair on my desk lol
Is it shedding?
:(
I dunno
I shed all the time
it's horrible
but I'm cleaning my desk, right
turns out that half the reason it looks so dirty
is 'cause there's hair on it
the other half is eraser shaving
s
rofl
sounds like my desk lol
Reminds me of my one friend's 360 that had problems with shutting off randomly
actually
sounds like half of my room
turns out it was overheating because its heatsink was clogged.
back
there was so much dust in it that
in his own words
it had fused together into a rug.
he picked at one corner of it and it all peeled away in one piece.
LOL

11Hey there
Hey, SirSprinkles, you there?
13Testing script
13Damn it's on
13inb4 kick
13Like a boss
Lol hey peanut.
6lol
6!addmod Flutterpeanut
6Does it work now?
Might not work with colours.
13Uh
13If it kicks once it wont kick again
I could make it work when you say the command are are using colours, but I'm lazy. :P
13But I am not a mod because I need to register this name
13Which I have no idea how to do.
6It's supposed to eventually ban, isn't it?
You don't need to register the name.
going t'the dentist's now
And no, per request it just kicks once.
13Oh, I don't?
6...oh.
6>>;
6Well, whatevs.
I asked how it should work and was told to let the mods deal with the person if they get kicked and continue using colours. :P
So Sprinkles.
How fast do you want the rainbow to move across the text?
13Hmm.
13What's the command to register again?
Email is optional.
8what have i missed thus far?
03:3333333333333333
13Hm. Tyvm Prince.
No problem.
6...lol
13Alright.
13Registered
13=D
/me huggles Sneas and Skylands
6So, I assume you're going to use that name from now on, Peanut?
11Hello
hi
13Well. Bronypeanut is outdated.
13So yes.
6I'll change it in the access list then.
/me just launched: Unreal Tournament GOTY (1998/1999) DEDICATED SERVER (beta)
11How are you?
13Also it'll stop me from accidently typing in Bronstate than Bronypeanut
13Because I've done that like 6 times now
Tired
13Yey.
13Now you can demod the other name
6Already did.
13Ah good.
13Also, on the about us the name and picture
13xD
6Picture?
13The picture isn't showing up
13is it?
11Same here

13Waitwhat
06ffff
6Gotta find a more permanent image address.
13Well done
06stupid connection...
I did keep wondering where they got that name.
13Oh, Do I have to send it to photobucket?
6You can.
10Meep
/me was nick alerted
6The thread on ponychan probably 404'd.
Maep
/me evil >:3

rawr
10Lyoko?
13http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l608/Flutterpeanut/130861929371.png
Yeah, however you spell Lesomethingko
xD
Sprinkles, did you ever answer me?
lol
11I wonder how DSD is doing?
code forehead-oko.
He's usually quiet
6...about?
Code Floridoko
/me runs
[18:36] How fast do you want the rainbow to move across the text?
florida is known for its enormous forehead actually.
So like !!RD's name, but how fast should it move across?
uhh
nvm
6Oh, I did not see that.
swamp
6About the same speed.
they needed a place to put all the swamps
so they drew straws
and florida
6Also, updated the About Us page.
with its huge forehead
I don't remember what speed it goes across.
got stuck with them and all their humid glory.
hello
yay
Find me one of !!RD's posts.
Hey Sathi.
...
I know I don't hear an ice cream truck right now.
6One moment.
is the letter to hasbro sent yet?
8hi sathi
8yeah, i sent it yesterday
ah, I wonder how they will react
and if they will react at all..
8no idea, im not expecting anything to happen really
6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/20623.html
hehe that's the best expectation
just wait and see
6He's the first reply, dari. :D
anyway I shall leave you all, see you tomorrow
Ok.
6See you then, Sathi
8bye sathi
haha, "frozen ice on a stick"
because no one wants regular ice on a stick.
8oh and btw sprinkles, TF2 doesnt work for me
it's gotta be the frozen kind.
8it lags worse than starship troopers
6...not surprised.
regular ice that isn't frozen is just water
that instantly falls
6Yeah, it lags hard on me.
6So I'm not surprised at all.
if it fell off the stick it'd just be water :(
hi, Feather =D
but it's water that stays on the stick.
02FEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR
10hi~
10RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
02:3
6Also, holy fork, it's Tuesday and I have both movies already... Oo
8nice
6I actually have all 3 Godfathers. XD
8btw, this is going to be far and away the longest movie night
6I know.
6Did DCD tell any of you anything about what we're planning to do since it's Brony Appreciation Day?
Mississippi home girl Feather, you be!
6Other than the banner dari's working on...
10yup
8no, but i was literally about to ask you
6I suggested we stream the first two eps so that they end at 7 PM.
6Since they'll never get picked in a lotto anyway.
born in Mississippi, raised in... Washington -_______-
6And it would be unfair to the lotto winners to stream any other eps.
13I'm quite intruigued. Hopefully my flash plugin wont fucking die every 3 seconds.
13I have yet to see godfather.
8DAH
8HOW HAS NO ONE SEEN THE GODFATHER?!
6I have. :D
I have.
6And I'll be watching it again tonight to make sure it works.
8ive seen it like 10 times
Though I fell asleep during the second and third ones. :P
8i have 3 movies saved on my computer
8the godfather
8godfather part 2
8and the hurt locker
Lawl.
Wait wut happened to the third one? :P
8cuz those are 3 of my favorites
13Haven't seen all 3 of those
8the third one is garbage
8not worth watching
13xD
8 3rd godfather movie i should say
13Meh. I just don't watch a lot of movies.
8everyone should see the godfather though
8one of the greatest movies ever
Ok, done Sprinkles.
I'll just render it and upload.
Then you can tell me it's crap. :P
6:D
6Guarantee it's better than anything I could do.
It looks how you said you wanted it at any rate.
6Also, guys.
ohai Feather /late
6I'm going to be guest commentating on The Brony Show next Monday. : D
8nice
6And seeing as they plug us most shows, I think we should at least plug them this week.
41 tabs on chrome, computer so slow, firefox open, photoshop open, 5 mIRC networks and 2 clients open. 11 folders open.
6And make them a partner when we start doing that.
8http://knowyourmeme.com/system/icons/2085/original/Kornheiser_Why.JPG?1267079689
8that was directed at dari, not you sprinkles
6I know.
I open stuff then never close it.
XD
8yeah, for sure
Well I keep open stuff in chrome to show other people later.
8i had a short chat with circuitmane last night, but we were both busy
So I end up spamming 50 links at some of my poor IRC friends.
And they say "Wut" then ping out.
6Yeah, I was talking to him in depth last night.
/me just launched: Unreal Tournament GOTY (1998/1999) DEDICATED SERVER (beta) (unreal://192.168.137.1:777)
06*7777
6YES.
6ALL THE YES
8fucking awesome
6*saves for now*
6I'll put it up first thing Friday.
You want anything changed?
6Looks great.
8maybe an exclamation point at the end
6...yeah, I guess I forgot to type that originally.
6My bad...
06Kyubeys
777777777777777777
Can do.
10666
06my irc app for the iPad is called irc999
I think that's the Quake port. lol
06i always call it irc666
6I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT
13!espeon
06it uses Quake technology :P
Lawl.
Hypnosis at its best.
(Owait, that's MLP)
8where are we putting the banner up, in place of the normal one?
The early stage: "WHY CAN'T I STOP WATHCING THIS?!?!"
6I was going to put it under the normal one.
stages*
8as long as its not in the viewing field
8could get distracting
6Oh, it won't be.
6The countdown clock is barely in the viewing field.
6And it'll be well above that.
/me closes the server for maintnance and bedtime
6It'll be between the regular banner and the site links.
06Gnite all
06~
12seeya
/me wonders if that's actually Feather playing TF2 under a rather odd name right now or if it's someone trying to be witty.
4Wow, so many mods together today
4Any reason in particular?
8boredom?
4Oh
8also, working on a few things
6Mostly boredom.
LOL
8like the banner dari is making
Ahahaha, you two are the same person.
6Which is really something I thought up, ran by DCD, and then asked dari to make...
4What's the banner idea?
13I got yelled at to keep a tab up in here. AND SO I DID.
6A rainbow banner for Brony Appreciation Day
4Ah
6He's putting in an exclamation point at the end.
4Looks good
6Also, DCD and I were discussing what we'll do as an event for it, since it's Friday.
6We tentatively decided on streaming Eps 1 and 2 at a time to have them end at 7 PM
4So airing the pilot
4Nice
6Yeah.
6Since they'd never get picked in the lotto
6And playing any other eps in a marathon would be unfair to the lotto winners.
4No, yeah, that's fine. I wouldn't think it's fair to the ep winners wither
4*either
6Obviously this would have been run by you guys tomorrow... luckily you're all just on today. XD
03WUT.
4I saw that Hip was playing TF2 earlier. Is it running well?
6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEnope.
8nope.avi
8deleted it from my laptop cuz it doesnt run AT ALL
8well
8it dies technically
8does*
8but its so laggy that gameplay is impossible
4Shame
4Oh, Sprinks
4I heard that RBD sent you a guest pass for Killing Floor
4Have you tried it yet?
6I have.
6Offline.
it could be Feather trying to be witty.
/me shot
4What did you think?
6Love it.
6I'd be playing it now if I could.
6But my steam doesn't work at this wifi... ;-;
Pfft, at least you aren't phone tethering as your only option
4Dude, you need to get someplace where you can play it so we can do a session
4Before your pass expires
6I know.
6I was hoping you'd be on earlier, since I could play on the wifi I was using then...
Lawl, added the exclamation mark wasn't as simple as it seemed.
I had to redo the whol thing. XD
whole*
4Well, I'm on now Sprinks
4Glad you got it working, dari XD
12!Espeon
12:3
6XD
6That sucks dari...
So now there are two versions.
More shiny and less shiny.
4But yeah, I sent you a friend request (or added you to my friends list) on Steam
I'll upload, you guys tell me which one you like more.
4So, you should know when I'm on Steam, send me a message through chat (through Steam, I mean) and then let me know when you're ready to play
13Were you Gold? o3o
6Cools.
13You'll know what I mean if you are xD
12Nope XD
13Ah, alright then xD
13it IS you who signed up though, right? o-o
How do you feel about word filters on the IRC? I think it'd be pretty funny.
12Yes
Especially people's reactions.
13:3
13Just wanted to make that clear in my mind xD
12Ah I see :3
6I think it would be hilarious.
6I like the stronger colours version.
4I'm against wordfilters on IRC
4Well
4Yeah
4I am
6For some words, Ghosties.
6Like, necessary ones.
4Nigger?
4Seriously?
4How often do we get people saying something like that in here?
4More importantly, how many use it as a form of trolling?
6Well, I'm saying we could impliment them as we need to.
8i think we should do it for the lulz one week
6It's just the option of having them, really.
4If we do implement them, do it for the laughs
4Not for "safety"
6Just put a TON of wordfilters in, Hipster?
8no no
I meant more lulz -> for the enjoyment I anticipated experiencing after performing said activity
Not serious word filters.
4Yeah, but not have it ALL THE TIME
8make them for funny stuff
6Oh, yeah, that's cool dari.
4Like, one BMN just have it on
8like have TOOT filter to FLOOT or something like that
4But just for the laughs and that's it
FLOOT!
6MOOT?
6I am ultimate troll. :D
Should filter no -> yes one day just for the lulz.
8oh god
8that would be so confusing
4Yeah, no
4Or yes
