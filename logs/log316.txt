I'm watcihng
*Watching
How could this happen.
All ready said that Scoota
it's not passed till every nation in negotiations have signed it
08,14Eeyup
07,01keep the people distracted / not aware
Welp.
13bread und circuses
13pretty much all us politics now
07,01this is FAR more WORSE
And then you have that one group on a mission to send satellites into orbit.
tbh it's also not democratic
in any way
no nations popuation has a say in it
08,14SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
07,01Spread the word guys!
knowing how effective copyright laws have been enforced in the last 25 years, I can't really take this angst propaganda seriously
Dat Cracken
another one...
Spice?
Every day, it seems the sky is getting darker. And every night the stars seem dimmer than before. "What a world," I said, "where trademarks run the people." In the end, none of it matters anymore.
"Noch einmal Ei!"
O_O
i hated it when we had to analyze it in school
13more egg?
but then i liked it
13or.. no wait einmal is only
Yeah I put the wrong word
Huh. I dunno. I was quoting from memory
i want to learn hacking, but i need to learn coding first
<this comment is pending approval by ACTA>
united as one
divided by zero
/me saultes~
13THE GREATER GOOD
that motto is incredibly lame.
I'd rather not have a violent revolution.
0,14^
Velvet revolution
No, an aerogel revolutiob
*revolution
(If you get this reference, you win)
Viva La Vida~
A*
i know about basic poisons and such
For example: Censored newspapers.
Praise jesus?~
i'm not any kind of assasin though
Holy-
protip...don't play with explosives
it's not the three facts you know about them that kill you
it's everything you don't?
Martial arts training, good with an air rifle, good with knives, good with nunchucks, and various other weapons, still don't wanna kill anyone. I'd like to think that the society we'd bring about would be one that could mostly avoid things like that. Using wits / whatever. We DO live in the information age.
But, even though I'm am an Anarchist. I am not Anti-Goverment. I am Anti-Current-Goverment.
Humidity, temperature, reaction and friction. That's all you need to be careful for.
/me doesn't need weapons, because he wouldn't start a fight in the first place~
For now.
>___>
"temperature..."
ACTA would put a stop to that, though.
ta ta Radu ~
Bwah Cya Radu D:
see ya Radu be well friend!
I know it looks that way
but have faith!
I have one too
X'D
I've been sharpening it
hehe~
Yeah, that too
I have a Dadao
I shall make it my mission to spread the word of ACTA in any way possible!
I mean protection wise.
/me pokes cat
hallo
...why
I got mad and threw it away.
That's not really mad.
I don't know!
not another one
stop?
That's just... oh well XD
Luna is demonstrating ACTA?
Episode finished
. . .
Damn
=w=
Impressive
Mhm,
And various other weapons
I can make landmines
Enough crap for an army there.
less acta, more ponies!
MORE PONIES.
I'm getting more soon,
07,01where>
/me is working on buying a couple AR-15's
Show ponies during a UN conference: all world's problems solved.
I like AR-15's.
well, you can't really have any weapons here.
Feels bad, man.
I've had people break in and attempt to hold me at gunpoint. Sawed-offs are soo helpful~ :3
As long as us lot can stay in comms.
people showing off their home armaments
Say, can we bounce communicaiton through the OFC yet?
Arkansas, and 7
That's not very legal in my country. XD
exactly my thoughts
/me is going AFK for a sec.
OOowww
There are no heros left in man.
^
yeah
give us a proper nick to address you by!
we've all*
lol
Be back in a jiffy.
The only reason I tune into NV is because 'Ain't that a kick in a head' plays on~
I can't say that I would be nowhere without finding this... but I'm glad I did. ^_^
<3333 Ink spots
4chan let me lose faith in humanity, my little pony restored it :)
lol
I feel like playing it now even
/me is back
and it suggested... 15+?

yeah... i'm having a heck of a time doing "All My Friends Have Off Switches"
http://fuzzybuzz.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/122009702124.jpg
Hey LC~
thankfully i grabbed the auto-doc first
yeah
Ponies originated from /co/.
also helps that this happened to be an Energy Weapons/Diplomacy playthrough
and Hardened Power Armor
Odd that we change the topic very quickly
ANYHOO. I'm off to actually make some pots less full of food.
Mods are asleep. Post Ponies.
Ponies are asleep. Post Mods.
the first pony war, which spread ponydom over the internets, happened on /b/
mostly
february 2011
I downloaded a mod to get a sprint function.
Oh really ?~
Yup.
well, aside from Kammerjunk's point that ponies came from /co/
./b/ ..... *shivers* ...the horror....
we wouldn't have half the wonderful memes we have now without 4chan
See you soon everypony! :3
That's it?~
I didn't care about 4chan back then...found the fandom in october
Buh-bye e'rrypony
<333 this trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZpR51XgW0
4chan was cool until chanology happened
Dammit
Hello and Bye Fleur! :3
:O Fleur!
Hey Fleur ~
you've just gone and proven my point
i haven't been to 4chan in months... not that that's a bad thing
Though I still hate 4Chan~
Or really really really really dislike it~
Hello everyone!
the /co/ stands for comics
00,10nope
:D!
is there not a stream on?
It's still nice being able to look at anything and not get sick, though.
Where the streams at.
oooo ok
mods killed em
because of acta
Uh... I'm not going to even try
~
acta isnt even bad as far as i can tell.
lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=N8Xg_C2YmG0
it'll be everywhere...
Why is it bad?
They're gone too.
if ACTA passes
we're all fucked
I think its quite simple really
13then we go together
well i gotta go, bye everypony :)
And in the Information Age, that's just not alright.
ACTA is a worldwide treaty that's supposed to establish various intellictual property-protecting procedures
they haven't been established yet, though
0,5>_>
emangamer's here!?!
it's politics...they don't need to know, they just need to make the decisions they are paid for
A suit of bacon~! Victory~~!

0,5All you need to know:

If you try, I'm sure you can get hold of a list of a bunch of e-mails.
Has ACTA been passed then?
do we need to unite
But it needs to be signed by the UN too.
Didn't the UN say they wouldn't sign it?
the EU looked at it and said "fuk dat"
well not exactly those words but you know
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-background-ponies-better-than-mane-six.jpg
Ha ha.
You realize how fast it'd be over if the US government truly cared?
Fact is, they see 'em as a nuisance, not a threat
This may be very wrong, but I kind of get a little excited to pick up the old mantle and start spreading messages again.
*sigh* ..... I really dislike politics -_-;
...which is probably fair. They really haven't done anything truly dangerous.
protest?
/me is home from work,
Ok, how do I do that?
Hello everypony.
ok
ACTA was already signed by the US
Voderful`
~
And several other countries
Well I just wathced it ~
It's been in business for some time.
mhm~
ok, thanks, I'm going to be on here often now that I found it(and caught up with the show episodes) and I use this name a lot and would like to cement it for here.
Piss of a country, then you're dealing with a slaughter! You try to quell it, but the fire's getting hotter! You make the motions 'till you citizens despise you. They pick another and the cycle starts anew!
...uh. I should know this seeing as I'm in computer repair...
I'm just amazed right now actually...

I do not want that~
If Denmark accepts ACTA, I'm going straight to America.

/me picks up his daggeer and fucks around with it, hoping he doesn't cut his fingers off

Uh-huh.
Ok, here goes

Oh, right.

/me Only needs a combat knife~
...Ok, lets try this again
Whoa...
Poland is seriously fighting against ACTA. Dat unexpected nice assistance~
I really like bowie knives.
They look neat.
Oh and hey Nyria~ although I've been lurking all the time~
I have a lockback, that's about it.
Yeah. :3
It's gerber, and that's decent.
...
At lurking? =w=
Denmark, being a nation with legal prostitution, sex from the age of 15 and alcohol from the age of 16.
No no, that's not something bad~
I hope we oppose ACTA.
wub?~
It's in my clipboard.
/me jumphugs back~
Denmark is a very socialistic country.
It's also nice having free health care.
The UK is after years and years of labour but recently the conservitive scum got into power
Not that I ever get sick, but I keep getting myself injured.
http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha, clever.
http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha.
Here in the US, our process has been pretty well subverted by corporate interests.
11,14lol
No problem.
Mathematically, we have two parties, as we have "Winner Take-All" elections.
Denmark wouldn't really gain anything from ACTA.
No one gains from ACTA.
Except the RIAA and the like.
nowhere would gain anything from ACTA apart from Rich people in the US
lol humans
That's why I said the second part.
;)
O: ~ yay~
Well, humans are silly anyway.
There are plenty of Corporations that gain from ACTA.
wubwubwubwubwubwubwub
...And a corporation is NOT a person.
Naw
Mostly the publishers gain, most corporations that aren't actually publishing don't gain squat
Well, the US has never had Lessaiz-Faire Capitalism, that's for sure.
^
...i don't know wut to say. :(
A Legal Fiction is now a person, but people are getting closer to commodities.
Kammerjunk:ok
Okay.
I get it now.
ok
As you said it, right.
it wasn't mean as sarcasm:(
Also:

Hah.
she's next week
okay, fixed client
I mean literally eats them and swallows them.
Did you say anything since?
Well
But yes it is
Capitalism is the oldest thing we have
No?
Yes
It changed, yes
Be like the UK, with a socialist/capitalist split
it became prettier
but it was born when people declared that "This is mine"
Or .anything, really.
Well, Greed is as old as the species, but Capitalism is the first time such a thing was channeled in a way it was effective.
alright guys my internet's turning off soon
No?
Yes
probably be back in a couple hours

Capitalism*
In many systems, greed is expected to somehow be expunged.
I don't really think socialism is as bad as some Americans I know make it out to be.
10,02And hai everypony!
Americans don't realize that we ARE socialists.
We should be like the ferengi's ultra capitalist society
Just not to the degree other nations are.
I would like but i wont have this discussion on english :P
and Korea
They still think of cold war?
McCarthy pretty much assured that.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/41280d0c-0fc5-4092-896b-860c9904208e.jpg
/me wonders if there are any diehard capitalists here
strings*
Ha ha, points for the reference.
Well see, McCarthy's slander and blatant lies still effect this country's perceptions. Nowadays if you say something is a socialist program, they get the mental image of Stalin and the commies, and they freak out.
8,1damnit, my glasses are behaving wonkily now
8,1i forgot to take them off when i showered
Saturn: I did that too, once.
okay, brb
Silly Saturn how can you do that!
I do that Saturn ~ Once I forgot to take off my socks~
But I use contacts now.
Thats just full on derp.
The argument that "No American has ever been ORDERED to buy anything by the government" Is a lie.

Ok, there we go. I am all set.
Oh hey Fleur ~

Derpy should derpi derpi

Okay, bye all.

10,02yup, I find talk about other dimensions interesting ^_^
I don't.
It just ends up confusing me.
hey everypony
Yeah that 38th dimension sure is something right ?
Alright.
hi brawn
ta ta rand- aw...
I don't want to spend the next 5 weeks figuring it all out.
0,14I think I travel through alt. dimensions in ym dreams
10,02I wanna hear it! But share it with me when i get home later.
Give or take, of course! Ha ha.
Good bye.
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: by other dimensions, i presume you're not talking about additional spatial dimensions required by string theory?
Insidious.
I think every huamn thought turns into a dimensions~
human*
trippy
are you confusing dimensions with alternate realities ?
I'm not the only one
............. :P
How hard?~
8,1particle physics
You're gonna stream Mythbusters?
Oh...
go on...
I'll try to understand~
yeah
yes
10,02Y
This place is going to fast
Bump uglies.....i mean Smite Evil
10,02Yup*
13Science!
I'm going ot the moon
Then I woke up.
It was really weird.
mfw when I get a 50 second song on my pandora
8,1so you can divide atoms into protons, neutrons and electrons. of these, electrons are kinda weird, in that they have negligible mass, but a negative charge
from The Killers' Sam's Town
8,1protons and neutrons have equal mass, but protons are positively charged
10,02Electrons are elementary particles.
Derp.... :P
10,02Protons are made up of quarks
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: stop ninjaing me :P
Why are we talking about chemistry?
why not?
No clue.
10,02AQuarks have different flavours ^_^
It's physics
wearent its physics
hmmm.... yes
8,1pah, okay, i'll not even go into quantum mechanics then
/me 8,1storms off in a huff
:(
but I was having fun
8,1but end of the day, leptons and quarks are actually vibrating strings in 9 or more spatial dimensions.
I don't either.
They confuse me in the end.
Ok, I finally figured this thing out. I'm good.
8,1acutlaly, i really liked that idea of streaming mythbusters
Oh, good
8,1who's streaming?
Yes eman?~
oh yeah, i remember
10,02But the biggest topic that interests me is the quantum foam, the smallest size possible to still make any physical sense.
DEEEERRRRPPPPYYYY
:P
yes, derpy
10,02Quarks are proven
10,02The string theory exists at the quantum foam level
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: quantum foam \o/
And Rarity doesn't seem pleased seeing her parents at her house...
13quantum..foam?
*didn't
13a challenger for my foam haddock approaches
10,02Its the point where the heisnenberg uncertainty principle takes place
8,1i like fermionic condensate
Derpy is the silliest yet most popular pony evar!
I think
10,02It's where matter can come into existence and disappear without breaking any physical laws
Guys, the spanish word for foot is pie
themoreyouknow.png
10,02Awww...
10,02;A;
lol nerds
XChat doesn't like colour.
hmmyeah
but that would make sense
I need to solve a puzzle be back later~
*Pinkie.
8,1*cough*#science*cough*
ok... 4+6= ...atomic energy...6_9
I can't believe i spelled her name wrong! derp...
10,02Big one last note, elementary particles are particles of matter that dont have any known materials that make up their form. essentially, electrons are just that, electrons. Same with neutrinos as well.
SOO
10,02I'm done ^_^
yesh?
TL;DR?
8,1basically, fermions (quarks, leptons and neutrinos) are fundamental
8,1as are photons, gluons and bosons
Saturn: I couldn't help reading "feminons" there.
Not magic

pinkie pie is best pony
full winter wrap up i italian
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOdx3sSR8-M&feature=related
I can scientifically prove pinkie pie is best pony
she has best voice
But I doubt abuse would lead to obsession of being like Rarity
not being rarity herself, but seeing that the reason she is abusing her is that she is evreything to her parents, but nothing in rarities eyes, and wants to be something, wants to be accepted
10,02As stated in the introduction to the guide :3
the 4th wall couldn't take her
we where litterally just talking about the guide
:O OMG UR RIGHT! OKay then, dash is my secong fav pony. Pinkie just took her place..
<3
*second
For me Dash and Pinkie pie are my favorite ponies
Twilight is still my favourite pony, followed closely by Trixie.
And thus, Twixie is my favourite ship.
sorry, I cant decide
D:
ouch
How does that even make sense?
k
I just like Trixie D:

:D omg!
I like you too!
Who's Twist?
Trixie is best pony

I don't hate her, but I don't much care for her either.
a hero?
Like a Superhero
I don't think she is a bitch.
can you elaborate on it?
who's a bitch?
At least I can understand why some would hate Trixie.
dont ask
Though I still think they're a tad vocal about it.
Her Voice is the best.
dont EVER say that again
I.
Trixie.
We still talking bout twist?
mmhmmm

I'm not the one calling Twist a bitch just beacuse, though.
because*
There needs to be more Trixie in season 2.
Wuh. 6_9
I stand by my opinion.
Oh... well okay then..
I don't like Trixie because I think her personality is likable, I like her because she is a good character for a show.
i see it now
Quite
hi everypony!!
Eh, I just find her annoying, I don't hate Trixie, but I don't like her ether.

Row row rice and flour.

>_<
I don't mind questions and I'll do my best to help you out.
I'm here on the Moon, by choice though
and BENDER!
and MOON PIES!
I like the moon.
But I like the sun more.
brb
GUYS I have a theory, I dont think that Luna was actually on the SURFACE of the moon. If you watch episode one when the stars combine the mare in the moon symbol on the moon dissappears. Maybe she was trapped "inside" it like the Man in the moon. (hence mare in the moon)
I plan to start working on Luna Land pretty soon up here.
Can any Alicorn send me to the moon please?
Luna spent 1000 years at the Lunar Theme Park
ow...
/me points to a spot on the blue prints "We'll put the bumper cars here"
I was hoping something less painful
/me scribbbles that in
but OK Thanks!
/me looks over LunaTheBeloved's shoulder
Wow...nice plans
OKAY!
/me points to the corner "here looks good"
FOR WUT?
Luna...tell...
Perhaps the lunar launch pad.....

Okay...
Eeeeh? Ha ha ha!
That could work.....
But I do anyway.
Again, sarcasam is my talent.
/me thinks we need to have an entire section on the moon for cheese...GET IT...cheese?
and mine is getting kicked by daribot!
no wait
that's not a talent!
We need a Merry-Go Round
Also, a rollercoaster to Mars? That's impossible.
GODDAMMITDARIBOT
oh ok
/me starts packing crackers for moon trip
thx
yeah
/me foams at mouth
RETURN of the BUFFER!
enope
otherwise spam would ensue
also, though I have no intention of writing them, I've come up with titles for Mod 4 and 5
but it would be fun spam

Buff Harder even.
