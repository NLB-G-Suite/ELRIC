The idea that words we use every day and even whole sentences, would be concidered copyright protected, and that I could be considered a criminal for using such "protected material" in someting like a term paper, just....:[

No Kammerjunk. No it's not.
ACTA bad.
kammer
An international version of SOPA and PIPA, notable for how loosely it defines copyright and that it demands ISPs packet sniff on their customers
Kammerjunk: ACTA is bad.
Okay.

Globetrotter: im informing our friends over the pond

ACTA is worse. Alright.
Yes, crisps

Either way, it won't pass thoughout the world. It'll cause mass revolution in too many countries.
its like a cyber dark brotherhood
They never see mass revolution coming silly.
Every day it seems the sky is getting darker, and every night the stars seem dimmer than before. "What a world," I said, "where trademarks run the people." In the end, none of it matters anymore.

What happened to our morals and ideals, which we paraded on our banners and our screeds?
Break off, make new country
Internet is free.
still exists kammer
just less
they are too dumb to realize that people will push back that hard

indeed
It's not even less

freaking out th teacher infront of class... good idea
turn this off
Millions of people that had no idea about it before would have found out
They'll ahve a lot of respect for here later
Wikipedia needs to black out against this
Google and Wiki did a good job
google did
The sad thing is there were millions more who still didn't understand why Wikipedia was down
I could still get around the wiki blacjout
has anyone emailed Wikipedia about ACTA?

Hallo
/me glomps back
...
Glomp?
Kammerjunk: Me too but it is a generaly accepted thought that baby cry is annoying. When the woman with her head open finds it annoying, it shouldn't be the big sign that something isn't right
Globetrotter: Yes. It's a word.
...
What?
hrm.
Globetrotter: It's a bit like huggles, only sounds funnier.
Globetrotter: Glomp is a word
its the same as being tackle hugged
"NOT sexual, it is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a hug."
Like a rugby tackle?
Kammerjunk: Actualyl glomp sounds like when a baby with no teeth bites on your finger
like sneaky snuggle attack
baby looks stoned
Ahh, my friend ninja hugged me once in the hall
So I picked him up and walked into a wall.
It was an interesting day.
Ictiv: That's a strange comparison.
But true.

KammerJunk, so how many eggs are in a container?
you missed a good one
Randomnerd: 10.
if it's the eggs from my local. 3 good ones the rest smashed.
i get my eggs 8 at a time
Kammerjunk: Metric -makes enough sense.
Eeyup.
In the states, you can get them in multiples of six.
Aha.
same here
as well as batches of 10
Half Dozen, Dozen, 18.
but...i can never get them in 6
or 24....
ever
I don't like 6.
It's a silly number.
tvoie: Usually the fancy eggs will come half-a-dozen.
"Hellevator's broken"?
i don't have fancy eggs
tvoie: They're not really worth it.
Has any of you ever had strawberry pie?
Real, home baked strawberry pie?
Eeyup
no just strawberry tart
they all come out of a chicken, so i don't think there's any difference
with clotted cream
Because it's not the same if you buy it from the baker.

Alright, now I'm back.
Hey there, everone.

Everyone, even. Also, hey there DerpyHooves`
How are you doing?
DerpyHooves` I'm not smart, I'm cheap.

That's good, that's good. How's the weather over there?
Kammerjunk: that's why i went out and bought a separate keybaord for my laptop
inb4 she codes
MirrorImage: Easier to travel without, though.
laptop keyboard works good when on the go, certainly
but my laptop is more of a desk computer anyways
LOL
I like the color scheme there, by the way, DerpyHooves`
I have my desktop at home, but right now, I'm living in the middle of nowhere because leakages.
which is why having a laptop as a desktop makes for a decent compromise
MUCH easier to move
i have a laptop on life support
yes... computers on life support are always fun...
i had a Windows 98 laptop on life support up until about 2005
and my dad's XP machine from 2002 only just now started crapping itself
I moved to Windows Vista before everyone realised it was baaaad.
So I moved to Windows 7 the moment I could.
it has no battery, even if it did, the charger doesn't carge, and the cord will fall out if it's at any angle and not strapped down
when i get a job and have the money to buy a proper gaming rig, that's probably what i'll end up doing as well

07,01und game over
stop?
That's just... oh well XD
Lulu: what just happened?
Luna is demonstrating ACTA?
Episode finished
I think so
/me has two shotguns, three pistols, 6 knifes, a baseball bat, a gas mask, and homemade gaseous poisons.
. . .
or mips just cut us off
Damn
Cy` you srs?
=w=
Impressive
Mhm,
damn Cy` you scary
And various other weapons
Cy`: Feels bad living in a country where knifes over 7cm are illegal.
chlorine is not a danger to riot cops might I add...
Ok everyone go to Cy`s when ACTA or SOPA.
I can make landmines
Enough crap for an army there.
less acta, more ponies!
If weapons were a right here, not a crime, I would so own a load of them.
MORE PONIES.
I'm getting more soon,
07,01where>
So... Cy` do you have that so when somebody insults MLP you could reason with him~
/me is working on buying a couple AR-15's
Show ponies during a UN conference: all world's problems solved.
I like AR-15's.
Kammerjunk, where do you live?
well, you can't really have any weapons here.
Nyria: Yes, and if people break into my house again.
hello everypony... im back. Just made some seriously good curry... =)
pony_3066: Denmark.
Feels bad, man.
Cy` is a stalker?
Cy would do better not at advertise "if content is being monitored...."
Ah
I'm not a stalker.
Get out of here, Stalker.
RawketLawnchair: Don't just stand there! Come in!
so whats everypony talking about?
Cy`: Okay~ When the revloution starts I'll give you a call~
grr.... internet Derped on me :P
I've had people break in and attempt to hold me at gunpoint. Sawed-offs are soo helpful~ :3
As long as us lot can stay in comms.
people showing off their home armaments
I know that the bronies didn't exactly originate from the peace movement...but seeing them go militant were weird.
Say, can we bounce communicaiton through the OFC yet?
Where do you live anyways Cy`o.o
Cy`: Oh, what's your kill count?~
Arkansas, and 7
That's not very legal in my country. XD
I'm guessing he lives in the Captiol wasteland Starflash ~
derpy_pony: Bronies going militant? what are you talking about? sounds good
LOL Nyria
exactly my thoughts
Nyria: That would make me jelly.
/me is going AFK for a sec.
I want to listen to Three Dog.
I would love to meet three dog~
Three Dog is so much more awesome than Mr. New Vegas.
OOowww
But seriously. The things I have seen since I became a brony, from the community, in the form of relationship, communication, and content being made, has gone a long way to restoring my faith in humanity. It is without doubt one of the greatest things to happen to me in years.
Indeed Kammerjunk, Mr. NV is just a bot~ Really he is an AI~
I miss 3 dog, too bad he wasnt in NV
Cool pony_3066 :D
There are no heros left in man.
same here, pony_3066
mr vegas was just too damned creepy
^
pony_3066: agreed. I would be in a deep funk now without the bronies
pony_3066: That's a story that we can all say we've experinced, oh and /nick (instert name here)
yeah
I would be browsing 4chan right now if I didn't find love and tolerance.
give us a proper nick to address you by!
we've all*
MR Vegas keeps playing that one song over and over again whenever I turn it on *strangles johnny guitar*
lol
I think we need a good ol' world peace movmement, cos I can see it here. Right now, as a general rule, I hate my country. But there are still the remnants of an awesome people. I'm going soon to do some chores anyway, so there's not much point
Be back in a jiffy.
I HATE Johnny Guitar
Kammerjunk: same here
The only reason I tune into NV is because 'Ain't that a kick in a head' plays on~
Darf14: there is a solution for that
but I LOVE Big Iron
I can't say that I would be nowhere without finding this... but I'm glad I did. ^_^
go do Old World Blues and make your brain regret it
<3333 Ink spots
MirrorImage: but that's a great addon
4chan let me lose faith in humanity, my little pony restored it :)
lol
ekips1 +1
I feel like playing it now even
/me is back
otakon: i know, i'm enjoying it... considering i started my first play through of it at level 5...
or ekips2 if you will
and it suggested... 15+?
long way from equestria has changed me
MirrorImage: it's best to do it at LEAST level 20
Oh hi, LordCelestia.
yeah... i'm having a heck of a time doing "All My Friends Have Off Switches"
http://fuzzybuzz.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/122009702124.jpg
hi LordCelestia the stream is kaput I'm afraid
Hey LC~
thankfully i grabbed the auto-doc first
we were too late
/me starts to laugh when the armaments talk ended up a Fallout talk. XD
yeah
Nyria: I beg to differ.
Makes me wish i had a Turbo Plasma Caster
Ponies originated from /co/.
I love those dear hearts and gentle people~
Fallout 3 and NV need a sprint button
also helps that this happened to be an Energy Weapons/Diplomacy playthrough
and Hardened Power Armor
Odd that we change the topic very quickly
ANYHOO. I'm off to actually make some pots less full of food.
you guys talking about New World Blues, that was my favorite NV DLC
Mods are asleep. Post Ponies.
Kammerjunk: We don't need that sight any more ^^ let it burn~
So later guys.
so i had plenty of ammo for the Sonic Emitter
Midnight_Tempest: that'll be Fallout 4
Ponies are asleep. Post Mods.
the first pony war, which spread ponydom over the internets, happened on /b/
mostly
Nyria: Fair point.
Randomnerd *Mods are AWAKE, POSTING ponies.
february 2011
Nyria, I beg to differ as well
derpy_pony: i remember that time Oo
I downloaded a mod to get a sprint function.
Oh really ?~
Kammerjunk: that would be Project Nevada, i believe
Yup.
well, aside from Kammerjunk's point that ponies came from /co/
./b/ ..... *shivers* ...the horror....
well... im gonna go already, i have things to do outside of the house... outside... *shudders*
/me is going to get off for now, until he gets home from work.
Darf14: You get used to it.
we wouldn't have half the wonderful memes we have now without 4chan
See you soon everypony! :3
That's it?~
I didn't care about 4chan back then...found the fandom in october
I will never visit that site again
Kammerjunk: that is the worst part of /b/, you get used to it
ta ta Cy` ~
Buh-bye e'rrypony
Cy`!
Nyria, how many memes do you use on a regular basis?
Cya Cy`
indeed... and if 4chan hadn't evicted bronies, they probably wouldn't have spread like they have
see ya Cy`
<333 this trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZpR51XgW0
funny how that works
4chan was cool until chanology happened
l8rs Cy
ScootaChicken: All the meme's~!
talk to you later Cy`
Dammit
Hello and Bye Fleur! :3
:O Fleur!
yes, MirrorImage
Hey Fleur ~
ekips: If I didn't get used to /b/, I wouldn't have stopped caring. If I hadn't stopped caring, I wouldn't have found this show and then started caring again.
precisely Nyria
you've just gone and proven my point
i haven't been to 4chan in months... not that that's a bad thing
What's /b/ and /co/ anyways =w='' or... do i even want to know
Though I still hate 4Chan~
Or really really really really dislike it~
Hello everyone!
did Sumica leave already...?
Hey Gumri ~
the /co/ stands for comics
Ello Gumri
dont ask Starflash or you might regret it
Kammerjunk: so..bad things can -sometimes- lead to goot outcomes
00,10nope
:D!
is there not a stream on?
/me hugs Sumica
It's still nice being able to look at anything and not get sick, though.
and /b/ was all the other stuff when /a/ was anime and no other boards existed
Where the streams at.
oooo ok
mods killed em
because of acta
Uh... I'm not going to even try
~
acta isnt even bad as far as i can tell.
lol
Does anypony have the link to that ACTA video?
Gumri: Yes, it is.
when will the government leave us the FUCK lone
So yeah. I'm so happy I've got nothing to do with 4Chan~~~~
nope
just search on youtube
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=N8Xg_C2YmG0
it'll be everywhere...
Why is it bad?
short version, if it passes, fannon dies
Gumri: Basically, it's worldwide SOPA except it allows every single packet of data you send out to be monitored.
Oh yeah, and no more fan sites.
They're gone too.
if ACTA passes
we're all fucked
I think its quite simple really
13then we go together
how exactly will they monitor encrypted connections?
well i gotta go, bye everypony :)
bye ekips
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWtY0x7o4eU Have this in the meanwhile.
Well since SOPA didn't pass that has no chance in hell to pass.
derpy_pony: And that's where SOPA would fail, too.
bear in mind the prosecution is not in the hands of the government but the company who owns the material shared
Gumri: the USA has already signed it...
it's just a matter of what they'll do to *try* and enforce it
im sorry? what?
derpy_pony: They just don't know how the Internet works.
13never attribute to malice what you can attribute to colossal stupidity, and celestia knows the US government has that in *spades*
And in the Information Age, that's just not alright.
if the owner does not wish to prosecute then your freedom is "safe"
perhaps it's time for a new age...
It's not okay to NOT know how the Internet works anymore, and ESPECIALLY not if you want to deal with it.
ACTA is a worldwide treaty that's supposed to establish various intellictual property-protecting procedures
LordCelestia: HERE! Click this and LAUGH! http://youtu.be/nohsA4R_1HU?t=3m49s
Ohai Shizuka <3
they haven't been established yet, though
Especially if you want to OWN the internet.
13hi emangamer
0,5>_>
hi emangamer
so there's still plenty of time for us to pull out the rolled-up newspapers, walk up to Obama, and yell "STOP IT!"
hey otakon
hi emangamer
emangamer's here!?!
how are you today Shizuka?
it's politics...they don't need to know, they just need to make the decisions they are paid for
also, i think Bush might've been the one to sign it if i read the wikipedia article correctly...
Randomnerd: And that's another thing. It's not alright to claim authority over the Internet.
A suit of bacon~! Victory~~!
oh i see so ACTA just stops file sharing? is that it?
A suit of bacon.
0,5Suit of bacon.....
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement
I actually think that suit is supposed to be crab shell
0,5======================================================
13not as well as i'd like
Gumri: Oh, no.
But I could be wrong.
0,5LEEROOOY BAAAACOOOOOON
mmm... backon
Internet is a free place~ Though I like to think the internet is another country~
LordCelestia: I KNEW you'd like that
Gumri: ACTA stops everything.
Well, arguing over who OWNS to internet is pretty self-defeating.
I mean bacon *facehoof*
as an another*
define: 'everything'
Internet is like a big metropolis
Randomnerd: not who owns the internet, who owns the stuff you post
LEEEEROOOOY WINGKIIIIINS!
Gumri: The internet~
and life
Gumri: I mean that it's illegal if you didn't create every. Single. Aspect. You made pony fan images? nope.avi
if you can think of it, someone already founded a club for people who do it
You found this funny song and sent it to your friend so he could hear it? nope.avi
I follow otakon. trouble is some people think they do.
hmm ok
sooooo much facehoof right now
You want privacy without using an encrypted connection? lolnope
i'm out guys
30 years ago, you could argue the Department of Defense owned the internet, or was closest to it.
Bye, Sundaysmile
Too late.
Gumri: you look at ANYTHING that has a copyright associated with it and the owner of the copyright doesn't give explicit instructions that you can, BOOM! You can be fined, imprisoned and even have your ISP pulled COMPLETELY.
Fan art
I'm going to play Viva La Vida everyday until the war with Anonymous and USA, Europe, and Austrailia~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE&ob=av3n
otakon: Gumri just left.
I think I'mma have to go everypony....I know my time here was short lived, but I'll make it up to you
Now it's basically like owning a piece of the sky, how do you do it?
damn
See ya emangamer
bye everypony <3
Until the end of the war*
emangamer: bye, come back soon!
ta ta emangamer ~
Have fun, emangamer.
oh my god
so many pings ,3
<3*
bye emangamer.... wow short visit :)
I think the emoticon needs to pop up when people type <3, ,3, or <#
So has this ACTA been signed then?
gtg, have fun everybody!
ta ta derpy_pony ~
0,5Make a stand against ACTA
0,5Tell EVERYONE
Old men, are the future.
0,5EVERY
0,5ONE
LordCelestia: I will. More at a time.
I have a past of spreading a message.
Fine.... let me just announce on XBOX Live...
Or messages, rather.
Though I must say... The internet will have to unite~ So... Hopefully the war between 4Chan and Ponies will be delayed~
LordCelestia: But first, could you post the link to the video?
0,5Ugh
0,5One sec
Sorry.
0,5All you need to know:
Gumri: It's still going on~ Just not that bad Remember 1/1/12 ~
0,5Its like they took SOPA and injected it with ten times more bad stuff for us.
0,5It means bye bye Bronystate
It means bye bye freedom.
LordCelestia, I think we've established that by now...
of course.
0,5Not everyone Neil
0,5We need to spread it far and wide
mfw you call me by my real name on IRC...
reading through the text of ACTA myself right now - http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/leaks/Anti-Counterfeiting%20Trade%20Agreement.pdf
Yean Neil~
Hi Neil
Neil Clake~
^^
mfw you spelt my last name wrong >.>
Well, so far, it's worked to post what people need to know in public places.
how do you spell it?~
It doesn't have to be long.
i have seen ONE good thing that i like so far: Article 2.5 - a person who has been found to have NOT infringed on intellictual party, the prosecuting party will be liable for damages to the defendant
Nyria... you see it every day on skype >.>
Clarke*
so there's at least reason for the copyright holders to not press on everything
Pffft haha.
Ok, I have officially found the best thing ever.
What that might that be
This site.
go to the #bronystate room by the way :)
Like, Anonymous once had a thing going called Project What's-It's-Face (I don't really remember), and the idea was to spread the word of a specific date, somewhere in 2013, and spread it everywhere.
ok
RawketLawnchair: oh god wat
lol RawketLawnchair
Oh, so this is where everyone is.
I'll work out the details when I get home on Friday and start spreading the message.
haha~
I'll need materials from home.
Yeah, I'm going to spread far and wide~
I've already spammed it to my facebook
and email
So... Who has 4Chan?~
and I've emailed my headteacher to see if he'll make an announcement in assembly tomorrow
lol, that comic was funny :)
11,14RawketLawnchair, that was awesome
0,5RawketLawnChair that happened to me one time. I did it to myself. I had a bacon cone.

ScootaChicken_: I call him Briffic
I propose using what ACTA would regulate and make sure this becomes widespread via the Internet.
http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/askmlcblobs/16405785076/1/tumblr_lyanlfDmCT1r5x4s2 Cute.
so cute
d'aw~
If you try, I'm sure you can get hold of a list of a bunch of e-mails.
SO FRIGGIN CUTE!
Has ACTA been passed then?
do we need to unite
Gumri: No. It's been signed in the US.
But it needs to be signed by the UN too.
In the future I would love to tell the story of the great war beetween USA and Anonymous~
Didn't the UN say they wouldn't sign it?
the EU looked at it and said "fuk dat"
well not exactly those words but you know
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-background-ponies-better-than-mane-six.jpg
so... sopa and pipa were just smokescreens to distract us from the real threat!
Nyria: What war?
Ok, now that I have gone back and read the stuff I should have read before, I'm good.
Ha ha.
Give me a sec CK|Mer ~
You realize how fast it'd be over if the US government truly cared?
I pledge my alliance to anon. The internet must remain free!
CK|Mer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0&list=FLXgHqoqFvpsqBPpYnWlCdRw&index=2&feature=plpp_video About to the end~
is there anything we can do to help anon?
Fact is, they see 'em as a nuisance, not a threat
proteset tvoie
This may be very wrong, but I kind of get a little excited to pick up the old mantle and start spreading messages again.
Oh, and I was wondering, I didn't see anything about making a permanent chat name, is there a way to do that, or do we stick with typing them in every time we join?
wait CK|Mer It's the other one~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roMf2RmRzFc&feature=related
*sigh* ..... I really dislike politics -_-;
...which is probably fair. They really haven't done anything truly dangerous.
protest?
sounds like a plan!
MadxHatter123: You can register your name so that no one else can claim it.
/me is home from work,
curse you google chrome
/me hugs Cy
Hey Cy ~
Ok, how do I do that?
hi Cy
/me hugs ScootaChicken_
Hello everypony.
it's three in the afternoon, should it be dark yet?
MadxHatter123: Err... Une momento.
ok
Nyria: Problem with that message is that it's two years old
ACTA was already signed by the US
Voderful`
~
So no stream today? just convosations about ACTA?
Ah, here it is.
And several other countries
Well I just wathced it ~
It's been in business for some time.
mhm~
Gumri: The former as a result of the latter.
And see, the core problem has nothing to do with protecting copyrights but rather copyrights themselves
ok, thanks, I'm going to be on here often now that I found it(and caught up with the show episodes) and I use this name a lot and would like to cement it for here.
Why am i so tired *yawns*
Piss of a country, then you're dealing with a slaughter! You try to quell it, but the fire's getting hotter! You make the motions 'till you citizens despise you. They pick another and the cycle starts anew!
Hey Asmalya ^^
/me hugs Asmalya ~
Wrek: It says you have a poll on DA but I dont know how to get to it :(
Kammerjunk: ...where do I type that in?
HEyas Nyria <3
MadxHatter123: Well, do you use the IRC on the site, or do you have a client?
...uh. I should know this seeing as I'm in computer repair...
I have a phantom feeling that Bronies are safe from Acta...
I'm just amazed right now actually...
I've read something that is just...wo
MadxHatter123: Are you on PonyChat via an external client which you downloaded?
wow*
See, you want to hear the TRUE problem, the Jimquisition has actually expressed it rather well.
Or are you on the BronyState site?
/me is always on the bronystate site~
Mods, okay if I post a vid link? ^_^
Stupid D/c
Uh, I'm using Google Chrome which I downloaded when I got my laptop.

There ya go. You want to know the actual problem behind the concept of "protecting copyrights", that video spells it out very well.
Hi
Ictiv: You just posted something that reeeeealy interests me.
MadxHatter123: So you're typing from bronystate.com/theatre/whatever?
.net*
:|
MadxHatter123: I know, right? Hasbro sponsoring, and in fact helping to make a Fan Fic video adaptation!
That's just...
Kammerjunk: 404~!
wow
almost, it's that but with twilight in place of whatever
http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/fluttershy/
Ictiv: Must be top quality.
there you go ^^
wow.... didn't expect that
:)
Kammerjunk: no really, check it out
Oh I didn't see the whatever~!
I mean ~*
Nyria: :3
ok i'm bored already...
/me starts to play with one of his kunai blades. :3
Hi, rainbowheaven.
Oh my~ I should ... yeah~
http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/internet-memes-world-wide-web-war-i.jpg
and then Nyria links to the correct room
rainbowheaven: We're discussing the Internet and freedom.
Kammerjunk: oh...okay.
and trying to help a newbie register his name.
MadxHatter123: Then you can just type it in #bronystate, as long as you remember to put the slash in the beginning.
ok
doesn't*
/me starts to fix one of his guitars
I do not want that~
kitten! hihi
:)
/me picks up his daggeer and fucks around with it, hoping he doesn't cut his fingers off
<3
At least I'll be able to own knifes longer than 7 cm there.
Gumri: What kind of knife is it?
a big one.
Uh-huh.
Ok, here goes
i don't know
So your doing it while your typing Gumri?~ Sounds legit~
I used to like butterfly knifes. But I then I found out my friend has one, and it gets boring after a while.
It looks similar to the klingon dagger
Oh, right.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-doesnt-matter-has-applejack.jpg
kind of anyway
/me Only needs a combat knife~
and on a completely different note, i have a purring kitty on my lap now who demands that i pet her...
...Ok, lets try this again
Whoa...
Hey Starflash ~
Poland is seriously fighting against ACTA. Dat unexpected nice assistance~
indeed it is ^^
I really like bowie knives.
They look neat.
Oh and hey Nyria~ although I've been lurking all the time~
I have a lockback, that's about it.
Oh you have Starflash ?~
Your good at it~
Yeah. :3
It's gerber, and that's decent.
...
At lurking? =w=
Denmark, being a nation with legal prostitution, sex from the age of 15 and alcohol from the age of 16.
Starflash: wut is ACTA?
No no, that's not something bad~
I hope we oppose ACTA.
rainbowheaven: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Xg_C2YmG0&list=FLXgHqoqFvpsqBPpYnWlCdRw&index=2&feature=plpp_video
I mean, your good at... Uh...
wub?~
thanks Kammerjunk. too lazy to look up the link :3
Nyria Wub. :3
It's in my clipboard.
yay~! wub <3
/me jumphugs Nyria
So anyways.
I wonder what is going to happen with ACTA in the UK, what with the conservitive government and all.
/me jumphugs back~
Denmark is a very socialistic country.
So that's nice too.
It's also nice having free health care.
The UK is after years and years of labour but recently the conservitive scum got into power
Not that I ever get sick, but I keep getting myself injured.
MadxHatter123: Oh, no.
http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha, clever.
http://i42.tinypic.com/2le2z4p.png Ha ha.
RawketLawnchair: Do ho ho.
Kammerjunk: That never gets sick thing, but hurts self sounds like me. And ok, good thing I didn't do that then.
11,14lol
OKay.. i get it, thanks Kammerjunk. ;)
No problem.
Mathematically, we have two parties, as we have "Winner Take-All" elections.
hahahaha RawketLawnchair ~
Denmark wouldn't really gain anything from ACTA.
So they basically have the same position on many issues, it's really just a question of degrees.
/me gives A wub button to Nyria
Wub wub.
Our primary export farm stuff.
No one gains from ACTA.
Except the RIAA and the like.
RawketLawnchair: Really?~ I can have it!~
CK|Mer: Publishers do.
No HUMAN, gains from ACTA.
nowhere would gain anything from ACTA apart from Rich people in the US
lol humans
Yes, its all yours, Nyria.
That's why I said the second part.
;)
O: ~ yay~
Well, humans are silly anyway.
There are plenty of Corporations that gain from ACTA.
wubwubwubwubwubwubwub
...And a corporation is NOT a person.
Naw
Corporations can go to hell.... Fucking capitalism should burn in a fire
Mostly the publishers gain, most corporations that aren't actually publishing don't gain squat
Kammerjunk: Hmm, it's telling me to put it as <password> followed by <email>
Well, the US has never had Lessaiz-Faire Capitalism, that's for sure.
Gumri: "What a world," I said, "where trademarks run the people."

...i don't know wut to say. :(
MadxHatter123: Hold on.
A Legal Fiction is now a person, but people are getting closer to commodities.
Kammerjunk:ok
wow, random, that's deep
AH! wrong thing!
Okay.
it should have been Kammerjunk: ok
I get it now.
arrowtobroknee: I don't know if that's sarcasm or not :D
You have you use your password and then your email, yes.
ok
As you said it, right.
It just registers your name, then.
it wasn't mean as sarcasm:(
Gumri: As much as I'd like to agree with you, we managed to build our entire civillization around Capitalism. We can't just throw it out the window without sending a formal invitation to Discord to come and rule for a few hundred years
Also:
......:P
My caht is bugged again!
Yay!
We need a new system in my opinion
Your what-now?
yay a cat~
i disagree Ictiv
verman supreme
I feel so bad for my cat.
Capitalism is like what?
ponies for all
very young...
arrowtobroknee: My fault, the internet is bad for dialogue.
Asmalaya, hold the thought
I'll be back in a moment
/me is back
Hi emangamer
Hey emangamer ~!
My cat eats my mom's earplugs..6_9
Yes! Vermin Supreme is offering ponies!
My cat has to stay at my grandparents until Friday, when we can move back into our house, and her home is completely unfamiliar to him ):

ok I really have to chill with the links dont I?
poor AJ
David Tennant has got NOTHING on Fury of the Pink.
Hah.
she's next week
okay, fixed client
I mean literally eats them and swallows them.
rainbowheaven: wat
I read you as far as "capitalism is very young" Asmalya
To be fair, my dog eats muffin forms
Did you say anything since?
Nope
Well
But yes it is
Kammerjunk: LIES! unless the Fury of the Pink is Pinkie, then that is totally true.
Kammerjunk: I know, right? It's crazy!
Capitalism is the oldest thing we have
:-/ I'm basically turning into a Social Democrat. There is no such party in my country.
No?
MadxHatter123: Oh, it is.
Yes
Capitalism stepped in the door when the first gold coin was made
It changed, yes
Be like the UK, with a socialist/capitalist split
it became prettier
Also, MadxHatter123: I don't quite know. It should recognise an email address as long as you have the @ and the .com parts.
but it was born when people declared that "This is mine"
Or .anything, really.
Well, Greed is as old as the species, but Capitalism is the first time such a thing was channeled in a way it was effective.
alright guys my internet's turning off soon
so bye
No?
<3 ScootaChicken_ <3
bye scoot
Yes
arrowtobroknee: It is nice like that but i would enjoy a new system all together
See you, ScootaChicken_.
probably be back in a couple hours
10,02I just ate a hot dog :3
Define Capitlism Asmalya
bye SchootaChicken
you can have people own stuff without having capitalism
Kammerjunk: hmm, maybe I put it in wrong, let me try again.

Capitalism*
SB <3 hello
10,02BAi Scootachicken!
Asmalya: Then define it, what is it
In many systems, greed is expected to somehow be expunged.
SuperBrony64|AFK: <3
10,02And hai everypony!
Oh hi, SB.
Hi SB64
We should be like the ferengi's ultra capitalist society
SuperBrony64|AFK: Hi.
Just not to the degree other nations are.
Socalism isnt bad, it's just been given a bad name because of the USSR
I would like but i wont have this discussion on english :P
and Korea
Sry, i'm kinda new here...:S
It is easy to fear what you don't understand
-The Military is a government organization we all pay taxes for, and support on the grounds that NO PRIVATE entity could provide the service.
They still think of cold war?
McCarthy pretty much assured that.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/41280d0c-0fc5-4092-896b-860c9904208e.jpg
Asmalya: how do you mean?
CK|Mer: Which I just don't think is alright anymore.
S'alreight, rainbowheaven .
Ohai rainbowheaven :)
Yous seem like an ok guy to me.
/me gives rainbowheaven a hug
we welcome new people
Ok, this thing doesn't like my email... let me try leaving and coming back and starting fresh. BRB.
/me wonders if there are any diehard capitalists here
We're living in a world where the largest repository (Not sure if that's the right word for it) known to mankind can be found in your pocket.
I've only been here since friday
Well, testing a theory on my guitar has now costed me string and 4 days of work... Great...
emangamer: thnx :)
your ok rainbowheaven *hugs*
It's not alright to hate something and not know what it is anymore.
IMMA CAPITALIST, AND IMMA NAICE GUUUUUUY
strings*
Ha ha, points for the reference.
Well see, McCarthy's slander and blatant lies still effect this country's perceptions. Nowadays if you say something is a socialist program, they get the mental image of Stalin and the commies, and they freak out.
8,1damnit, my glasses are behaving wonkily now
SuperBrony64|AFK: you back?
...We have many "socialist" services. The Post Office, which is no longer really effective... hell, sailors were expected to pay for their own health insurance, and were mandated to do so.
8,1i forgot to take them off when i showered
Darf14: Thnx :)
sorry I was watching john tron
okay, brb
john who?
But I use contacts now.
How could you forget to take off your glasses like that?
Thats just full on derp.
RawketLawnchair: It's rather easy, actually.

Well, testing a theory on my guitar has now costed me strings and 4 days of work... Great...
8,1Gumri: they're on my face all the time, i don't even notice them!
Eh, the post office is a poorly run business, not really a socialist program.
8,1like some kind of eye-correcting parasite
Ictiv: Iam too tired to translate everthying in english. I still thing capitalism is not that much old since well...you cant just say "oh if people want to own stuff thats capitaislm therefore its 3k ears old" in my opinion...i dont think they had capitaism in the roman empire and that was probably longer then our current

^^^^^^6
that video that is in the newsletter was not a video of our chat.
They've fallen on their own faces and failed to manage their budgets properly, which is only natural because it's run by the government.
there was not a single mod in there
RawketLawnchair: Once, I wondered for a moment where the hay my glasses were, when they were right on the bridge of my nose.
lol at fluttershy's pistol
I HAVE RETURNED!! Ok, no more shouting.
George Washington issued an executive order that expected all able-bodied men to supply their own weapons.
You don't really notice them when you've gotten used to them
the 3rd amemendment\?
A tree?
and I remember atleast Lulu saying something in that part
Fleur: it says it was. To everyone who asked: This was Pinkie Pie's room on bronystate
did anypony see the last roundup? stupid question...
rainbowheaven: derp
of course
The thing is the USPS must be run at a loss because it has to deleiver everywhere, everyday.
hmm
deliver, rather.
Kammerjunk: Yes.. derp...
shoulda recorded the mane chat
Last roundup AKA best episode ever
indeed
Oh, wait, I think I now what I'm doing wrong.
/me knows that every ep gets better and better
/me hugs Fleur
or the cutie mark chronicles
The Last Roundup was pretty damn awesome.
/me cant wait for the next ep
Every episode is the best episode ever~ there going to keep on out doing them selves every time~
/me hugs emangamer
Fleur: The way I heard it, the mane chat was down because every one of the Mane 6 rooms had 5000 users.
rainbowheaven: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly892sSiSg1r88ssco1_500.jpg
If run by a private entity, some people would only get mail when it was worth the price of Fuel to deliver it.
I was in the mane chat
How are you today Fleur?
So you'd have to pay out the nose to send a letter, or it'd stack up for weeks until they could justify the cost.
CK|Mer: Fox News?
It exploded like nobody would believe!
Ok, there we go. I am all set.
emangamer: yes. yes i am. :$
5000 x 6 is 30,000, when there are only 10K bronies on record
Oh hey Fleur ~
An explosion of reactions.
I'm blind, I didn't see you there~
I am good today emangamer
cool Fleur is here
rainbowheaven: dont worry, we were all new at some point. Just remember RAWRity and I are the ponymeme guys.
Even though there's nothing actually WRONG with the core concept of socialism, and in fact it's more morally correct than a capitalist system that exploits the labor of the poor and middle class.
I'm aware -I'm a US History student. I spend a lot of time thinking about this sort of thing, though sometimes my conclusions are wrong.
Fleur, you gotta get somefink to eat.
arrowtobroknee: Alright, it may be rounding up a bit, but hey, I wasn't in any of the Mane 6 rooms, nor in #bronstate.
bronystate*
for example: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/3bb06207-ea1b-482a-b63d-8faf806bb600.jpg
rainbowheaven: Oh your new!~ Wonderful more people to our family!~
emangamer: Oki doki loki.
There's a crazy problem with the golden rule... some people don't expect be treated kindly.
RawketLawnchair we have been over this. I /cant/ get something to eat.
Bornstate?
I am the random guy here, so dont take me seriously here rainbowheaven
Oh. Well, that stinks, Fleur. I'm sorry to hear that.
Mmmm random~
Nyria: Yeah, i was looking for a place to chat and here i am!
Darf14: Which one of them?
Asmalya: I think what you think under Capitalism is more like Monopolism, meaning corporation and other large economical forces. The thing is, capitalism is the definition of a whole type of economy. An economy where individuals are the ones making transaction for their own goals. Now most problems came in with Monopolism, but it was a completely natural evolution. And even long before there were lot of problems with the system (Ancient Gr
Because pianos.
Nuts.
CK|Mer: I'm living in a pretty socialistic country right now, and it's pretty nice here.
Ictiv y u so much textwall :O
Kammerjunk: Yeah, I got one last question. Is there a way to go straght to bronystate and not have to go through one of the mane 6 rooms?
which one of who?
rainbowheaven: hehe~ I can relate~ But it's good to have you here~
/me would love to eat something but has no moneys and wont mooch off of friends
As if anypony has enuf time for reading them before you post the next~
Starflash: Because I either wall or spam. And spam is too easy to eat through
/me le sigh~
MadxHatter123: Well, you could get some software like mIRC or something.
I'm not sure how we can get politicians that aren't so easily bribed.
Nyria: You got over it. Now shush and look the other way
/me makes Fleur a sandwich
New spamroom #Ictiv >__>
Go there if ye want spam >_>
what kind of coldcuts would you like Fleur?
/me snuggles Nyria
Im going to go now people. Bye!
Starflash: inb4 no channel advertising
Cya Gumri~~
/me snuggles Asmalya back~
Sweet dreams, Gumri!
/me noms on sandwich and wishes imaginary sandwiches were filling
Bribery is unavoidable, granted, but how the hay are you -bye, Gumri
ah, eh, I'll just stick with going through the mane 6 rooms.
bye Gumri
Hey bronies :D
hello SWAG
Lol. Although it's not a channel
hello
Hey Swag man~
Sorry mods, it's not a channel~
Swagger dagger.
/me is sad because no one wants to discuss interesting things.
How the Hay can you deal with people who seriously will sell out for a little bit of money/
It's fine Starflash~
what interests u ictiv?
Ictiv: interesting things, lets discuss them.
There are people that are threatened with DEATH that hold up better under pressure.
do you not have ANY food in your house?
Has anypony seen a video called "Baked Bad Apple Pie" on youtube? if not u shuld check it out!
arrowtobroknee: IDK who you are but you will get slammed for that name.
[SWAG]thehated5689: A lot of things actually, mostly things that if I mention people walk right past them
Rule 1 is to never talk about food, unless your giving it~
But somehow, an asshole folds at the first whiff of money :-/
It's so AWESOME!*Rainbowdashsqueal*
Well, if anypony just only mentions a certain book, you've got Ictiv talkin for a couple of hours...
emangamer: Too late.
Ictiv: http://youtu.be/co5ks1ZXrxw
Kammerjunk: you already did it?
Starflash: Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?
A certain book?
emangamer: No, but somepony did.
arrowtobroknee? yep, kicked in a hearttbeat
Wjth a
With a trout.
Fleur: WHY would you?
There ^w^ Nice guess Kammerjunk
lol wut?
hehe that video~
Kammer: That's my point exactly though. We keep insisting that the capitalist motto is "best" but then we wonder why other socialist countries constantly poll higher than us in every category. :P
Fleur: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2044/
im fairly sure page 42 in the hitchhikers guide has a way to disprove God
It's because capitalism in our country is so out of control that it's starting to collapse under its own weight.
Dem A's~
Starflash: What book did you mean?
That feel when your contacts are worn to the point where you can feel your eyeballs when you take them out.
ew
So... omg.. i ran out of things to talk about!:O
You, Kammerjunk, live in the most socially-mobile country in the world now.
[SWAG]thehated5689: Depends on which version.
That feel when your eyes derp
What Kammer said. Hitchhiker's
dang, its hard to do work and chat at the same time 6_9
Randomnerd: Really? That's nice.
rainbowheaven: When that happens just go with the flow ^^
Also there's always muffins to talk about~
lol
emangamer: win
/me has the ultimate guide, all books in one, and it alone got me through middle school
Hi everypony!
Nyria: oki doki loki.....
Nyria: My dog eats muffin forms ):
hola sir
Fleur: seriously MLFW is one of the best sites for reaction pics...
What?~! It does!
Ohai StinkomanFan~
It's an abstract, but the problem is here in the states, we're probably going to have crappier lives than our parents.
Kammerjunk: You poor man~
Then again, my dog eats everyting.
/me hugs Kammerjunk ~
everything*
Really.

Starflash: I Can't talk a lot about Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's not worth talking about. If you needto talk about it, you obviously didn't read it because you'd know it is something that envelops you in a cuddling warm towel and becomes one with you
My dog once ate my dog
00,10Have fun all, Time to go earn more cash for ponies.
StinkomanFan: wat
(Text wall again)
huh, never heard of that site, better check it out
Muuuuffiiinnnnssss...... so sweet and tast- oh wait wrong song...:P
Sumica: how? and can I join?
Bye, Sumica
Sumica: Cash is for the weak.
ta ta Sumica ~
bai sumica :)
Cya Sumica~
bye Sumica
00,10It's called a job emangamer =p
Although this time the textwall was interesting enough to read, Ictiv XD
My dog ate my dog, what's so complex about that?
And you DO talk about it A LOT.
Sumica: oh I thought you ment make money OFF OF ponies
But seriously I can talk a lot about a few things... For example: Why isn't Time Travel DEFINETLY impossible!
But yeah, we hate "Socialism", so fuck that shit, right? :-/
Oh lord not time travel~
emangamer knows half of it
Ictiv: BUT! Do you know where your towel is?
but not the interesting part
Because stuff can go faster than light! Yay particles~
Kammerjunk: As I said before: I AM a towel
I have way too many towels
/me follows Nyria though
Ictiv: wat
00,10Oh that's easy emangamer draw them well or draw them sexy then charge to draw.
Hey Randomnerd, did you like the story I gave ya yesterday?
I know where my towel is.
But I'm still not as hoopy as Zaphod.
It's interesting!
Ictiv: well i'm sure doctor whooves knows wut to do...
rainbowheaven: not really you had the right song but the wrong language: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Je4AlkeFY
You sass Zaphod? Now there's a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is.
Hey Nyria step into my tardis to espace talk about time travel!
rainbowheaven: har har
*grin*
And Ford, too.
quick! I need to know how to sign in with my registered name before I am disconnected again! (Is MadxHatter123 by the way)
I miss Doctor Whoof
Sure Asmalya~
I love foreign ponies
Sumica: but..."sexy" ponies are forbidden around these parts
arrowtobroknee: we all do
/me walks in hoping to not talk about timetravel~
hopeing*
they're better than us
the russian cupcakes song is AMAZING
Has Marty McFly ever crashed into the TARDIS?
00,10indeed they are. But there are able to roam free in others.

8,1couldn't see shit.
What shirt?
Agh.
Kammerjunk: Ok, thanks.
And what's wrong with Tara?
Russian is absolutely brilliant.
Raelly.
Really*
French suits Rarity
It's a nice Injoke

Wow, I can't type for hay without my contacts.

DOH!
Kammerjunk: where I live there are several russians living here
You want to hear fancy? I'll give you fancy!
I guess? I mean, it's a reference, so I got it.

This is fancy! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrIbrYROLig
Go to 1:20 or something for awesomeness.
10,02So, what's new everypony?
Kammerjunk: that voice is SOOOOOOO sexy
wait... arrowtobroknee THEY HAVE IT ON NICK JR. THERE??? NOT FAIR
I would go gay for that voice
emangamer: I would marry that voice.
Lots of russians on the south shore, yeah.
Every Pony now speaks fancy
Kammerjunk: *facehoof* I forgot to write down what you said.
SuperBrony64|AFK: No one wants to talk Time Travel and Science with me :(
Behold! The capabilities of modern technology!

do you guys want to hear my newest ringtone?
SuperBrony64|AFK: Nothing really~ But thanks for asking~

SuperBrony64|AFK travels through time everyday~
arrowtobroknee: Lucky, I have to watch it online.
Kammerjunk: Thanks.
No problem.
I usually travel in time , when i dont im late
Well, I'm off, meeting a lady, so this should be hilarious.
I used to talk about it Ictiv... Then my grandfather became my uncle
hmm..... I wonder what Derpys voice sounds like in Fancy
-ly awful. :(
TrixieMuffin: Well, of course -you- can travel in time, being second best pony and all.
StinkomanFan: dot dot dot
8,1"It's like...
8,1someone distilled the most interesting man in the world's essence, let it age in the finest oak barrels for 150 years, and bottled it in crystallized testosterone. They then took that, and made the darkest stout in recent history, which was fortified with above mentioned concoction. ﻿ The resulting brew was then served with a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon, covered in a reduction of that fortified stout...
Also, being great and powerful.
8,1And figured out how to make something sound like that."

8,1indeed
Oh god. I just found the Japanese versian of giggle at the ghosties...:O
that sounds deliciously amazing
rainbowheaven: wat
Kammerjunk: Yeah...
if derpy is canon now, does that mean hasbro has licence to make derpy dolls?
Dat sexy French Flutterguy.
maybe
hey SuperBrony64|AFK do you care to hear my newest MLP ringtone?
Derpy should derpi derpi
Rule63 Fluttershy under poison joke would sound like Kathleen Turner, lol
Hasbro had lincense to make derpy dolls until now too
Okay, bye all.
Bye~
See you, Randomnerd.
10,02yup, I find talk about other dimensions interesting ^_^
I don't.
It just ends up confusing me.
hey everypony
There's a reason I don't question time travel logic in films.
hi brawny
Yeah that 38th dimension sure is something right ?
Alright.
hi brawn
ta ta rand- aw...
I don't want to spend the next 5 weeks figuring it all out.
0,14I think I travel through alt. dimensions in ym dreams
I am going to go to class now.
10,02I wanna hear it! But share it with me when i get home later.
In another dimensions we all have ponies :s
Avê, Brawny. Quid agis?
I'll be back in about, ah, 3 and a half hours.
10,02Hey Brawny
Give or take, of course! Ha ha.
who here likes EPIC bass brops?
Good bye.
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: by other dimensions, i presume you're not talking about additional spatial dimensions required by string theory?
SaxyPretender: I saw a film about that recently.
Insidious.
I think every huamn thought turns into a dimensions~
human*
trippy
does everypony have a dream and know its a dream, or tottaly go with said dream, forgetting everything else but what they dream tlls you?
are you confusing dimensions with alternate realities ?
Oh good Nyria
Nyria: that is a loose interpritation on a certain theory yes
I'm not the only one
I can explain it to you Nyria if you wish
............. :P
I don't know what the buck is going on
[SWAG]thehated5689: Well, I once had this really trippy dream which I knew was a dream.
Oh ... I can't wait until I'm older emangamer, but thanks ^^
8,1okay guys, i think it's time for some hard science
How hard?~
cake?
8,1particle physics
You're gonna stream Mythbusters?
Oh...
go on...
my gosh... SCIENCE!
10,02I talk about whatever dimension I want ^_^ I'm a paladin, i hit peps wit mah stik :3
and cake?
I'll try to understand~
For Science
8,1okay, so y'all know what atoms are, yes?
yeah
yes
10,02Y
This place is going to fast
Bump uglies.....i mean Smite Evil
10,02Yup*
SuperBrony64|AFK i have no idea what you are talking about. Into the washing freezer you go.
13Science!
I'm going ot the moon
there can be no science without cake
It was like, I was in the clouds, and I could see large cloud statues in the distance. I went north (How I knew it was north, I shall never know) and suddenly, the cloud canyon gets flooded. There's an alligator, so I kick it.
Then I woke up.
It was really weird.
Kammerjunk: Ugh, this is so confusing. Where do I type that stuff in?
/me throws SuperBrony64|AFK into washing freezer and puts in fabric softener
Science = Robot Overlords
that sounds amazing kammerjunk
mfw when I get a 50 second song on my pandora
Mad: Just in the chat.
8,1so you can divide atoms into protons, neutrons and electrons. of these, electrons are kinda weird, in that they have negligible mass, but a negative charge
from The Killers' Sam's Town
So... how about we discuss more theories on ponies?
I for one welcome the robot overloads
[SWAG]thehated5689: And I wasn't even sick or anything.
8,1protons and neutrons have equal mass, but protons are positively charged
10,02Electrons are elementary particles.
Derp.... :P
13ponies should poni pony
10,02Protons are made up of quarks
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: indeed
kammerjunk: i want to have a dream like that
and neutons are neutral
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: stop ninjaing me :P
Why are we talking about chemistry?
why not?
No clue.
10,02AQuarks have different flavours ^_^
It's physics
wearent its physics
hmmm.... yes
10,02Like banana flavoured :P
8,1pah, okay, i'll not even go into quantum mechanics then
I beleive that each of the mane six have deep seated issues
/me 8,1storms off in a huff
:(
but I was having fun
Also Rarity and Sweetie Belle have undergone abuse
SuperBrony64|AFK: :O
8,1but end of the day, leptons and quarks are actually vibrating strings in 9 or more spatial dimensions.
10,02I love quantum mechanics ^_^
how so?
I don't either.
Dang ads....
They confuse me in the end.
Ok, I finally figured this thing out. I'm good.
10,02Protons consist of two down quarks and one up quark, the oppisite is true for neutrons
8,1acutlaly, i really liked that idea of streaming mythbusters
Oh, good
8,1who's streaming?
like what signs from Sweetie and Rarity show signs of abuse?
gah! What am I doing?! Im studying math right now and im learning science DX *goes back to math book*
Well, have you seen how Sweetie acted when AJ got upset with Apple Bloom?
hey Nyria
Darf14: hah.
Yes eman?~
You know, I never would have found this place if it wasn't for the awesomeness that is Derpy.
Have you seen Mr.Heisenberg around here somewhere ? A: I can tell you where he is , but not at what speed he travels!
oh yeah, i remember
MadxHatter123: You are so right! same for me!
10,02But the biggest topic that interests me is the quantum foam, the smallest size possible to still make any physical sense.
SuperBrony64|AFK: isnt that just an idea? quarks are just imaginary unless you accept the string theory correst?
DEEEERRRRPPPPYYYY
:P
yes, derpy
10,02Quarks are proven
10,02The string theory exists at the quantum foam level
but what about rarity, she seems more undisciplined than abused to me
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: quantum foam \o/
And Rarity doesn't seem pleased seeing her parents at her house...
13quantum..foam?
*didn't
13a challenger for my foam haddock approaches
Yeah, i found a video on youtube that showed the reactions of you guys to her part in the recent episode. Which was awesome by the way.
10,02Its the point where the heisnenberg uncertainty principle takes place
8,1i like fermionic condensate
Derpy is the silliest yet most popular pony evar!
Quantum Foam Party
I think
10,02It's where matter can come into existence and disappear without breaking any physical laws
Guys, the spanish word for foot is pie
themoreyouknow.png
SuperBrony64|AFK: can we stop talkign about quantum mechanics please?
Okay what are you nerds talking bout? no offense...
10,02Awww...
emangamer it's interesting :O
emangamer: I can't see SB's messages anyway.
10,02;A;
lol nerds
XChat doesn't like colour.
rainbowheaven: I agree, after Fluttershy and Pinkie of course.
it could be something along the lines of rarity being neglected by her parents and taking out on sweeite bell, that what i heard around the interwebs anyways
Starflash: it is interesting but it is too lengthy for this chat
8,1SuperBrony64|AFK: damnit, now i want to go on about van der waals force and using meta-materials to create a simulation of rindler space
hmmyeah
but that would make sense
SuperBrony64|AFK: I'm sorry. I love physics but it is too wordy for this chat
MadxHatter123: True. Pikie is just Hyper and flutytershy is the tnder loving pony we all know and love
I need to solve a puzzle be back later~
*Pinkie.
/me hugs SuperBrony64|AFK "I'm sorry"
8,1*cough*#science*cough*
Well I don't know crap about it anyways, since I've only got a simple degree in universal science -w-
ok... 4+6= ...atomic energy...6_9
sorry, im not the best person to hold an intellectual conversation with, i usually just get lost in thought
I can't believe i spelled her name wrong! derp...
IDK Sweetie seems content with staying with Rarity. Overjoyed even
rainbowheaven: Yep, that's why fluttershy is the main focus of my first mlp fan fic
10,02Big one last note, elementary particles are particles of matter that dont have any known materials that make up their form. essentially, electrons are just that, electrons. Same with neutrinos as well.
SOO
10,02I'm done ^_^
yesh?
TL;DR?
I have learned so much
8,1basically, fermions (quarks, leptons and neutrinos) are fundamental
rainbowheaven: You spelled fluttershy wrong too.
8,1as are photons, gluons and bosons
SuperBrony64|AFK: who would win in a fight Thomas Edison, or Nick Tesla
I thought you were into bioengineering, superbrony
Not magic
Too much 4chan for me.
Did I? :O no!
yeah
Edison made tesla's experiments possible
8,1Kammerjunk: the elementary particle of women?
It just seems that there parents seem a bit... off to me
dat science
yeah that would make sense, but there was this one thing about sweetie bell always wanting to be up to rarities standards and doing everything she can to be what she wants
dat mass

Rainbow dash is my Fav Pony.
:D
arrowtobroknee: http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/xmanooo7/1237146724487.jpg
10,02Fermions are best elementary particles.
rainbowheaven: false
pinkie pie is best pony
True, Sweetie seems to want Rarity to like her
Science, even if it will doom us all we really need it
full winter wrap up i italian
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOdx3sSR8-M&feature=related
I can scientifically prove pinkie pie is best pony
emangamer: you've got a point, but like i said rainbow is my fav. just my opinion...
she has best voice
But I doubt abuse would lead to obsession of being like Rarity
rainbowheaven: science proves that it should be everyponies favorite pony
emangamer: how? PROVE IT:[
10,02It's an important and popular fact that things aren't always what they seem...
not being rarity herself, but seeing that the reason she is abusing her is that she is evreything to her parents, but nothing in rarities eyes, and wants to be something, wants to be accepted
13space is big, really big
rainbowheaven: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6QdiP5LYdeE/Tt73-BBZkYI/AAAAAAAAB58/M73rLzHlG6k/s1600/PP.png Scientifically proven
Shizuka: no...space is infinate, really infinate
10,02You just wont beileve how mind boggling big it is
13and so on
Science cant even handle Pinkie Pie
10,02As stated in the introduction to the guide :3
the 4th wall couldn't take her
rainbowheaven: told you :P
we where litterally just talking about the guide
:O OMG UR RIGHT! OKay then, dash is my secong fav pony. Pinkie just took her place..
<3
Ah, so she's the lesser child then, unlike with the Apple Family where they're all loved equally
I will now break you heart, Dash is my 5th favorite pony
*second
i guess so
For me Dash and Pinkie pie are my favorite ponies
Twilight is still my favourite pony, followed closely by Trixie.
And thus, Twixie is my favourite ship.
Darf14: that contradicts the very definition of favorite
Darf14: AWESOME;)
sorry, I cant decide
/me slapps Kammerjunk HARD so hard that he breaks a table by falling on it
So, the Apple Family have some interesting theories in and of themselves
D:
ouch
How does that even make sense?
brb dog shasing dog
Big Mac alone would be worth a short essay
k
emangamer My table!
I just like Trixie D:
sorry DashWithRainbows but he deserved it

Who doesn't like Trixie?
Trixie is second worst pony next to Twist
:D omg!
No. You no breaky my table.
emangamer: WHY do you hate Twist?
I like you too!
Who's Twist?
Kammerjunk: because she is a bitch
Trixie is best pony
/me supa flips tables to emangamer's face that they break the sound barrier
It's not like she didn't want to be Applebloom's friend after she got her cutie mark.
She just happened to get her.
rainbowheaven: the pony that was applebloom's friend
twist was that one pony from the cutie mark episode
Decription?
DashWithRainbows: MY teble...
Kammerjunk: Someone hates Twist! They have no soul.
/me strangles Darf14
10,02The pan galactic gargle blaster is highly regarded as the most alcoholic drink ever created. its effects are similar to that of having your brains smashed together with a lemon wrapped around a gold brick
WAIT!
URK! X_X
what kind of theories are u thinking of, i havent heard much about AJ
Sorry, but all tables in chat are mine since i spawned them and flipped them mahself
/me streals SuperBrony64|AFK's gold brick
is she the filly with the glasses?
Yes
rainbowheaven: the BITCH with the glasses? yes
emangamer: Applebloom, however, didn't want to be Twist's friend after Twist got her cutie mark.
The one with the lispth
So it's Applebloom's fault.
:O :D
Kammerjunk: there is nothing in the episode saying that
and besides thats not why I hate her
you cant forget the god disproving babble fish
I just do...shes a bitch
Well, the 4 of them togher have plenty
the babel fish knoes all
*knows
emangamer: So you hate her, but you don't know why?
you must really hate ...err.... that one pony that I will not name again.... please dont hurt me :(
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+god%3F
8,1nopony is streaming currently?
what ones do think are the most likely or abstract
nope
That's like hating socialism because you hate socialism.
Who actually likes Twist anyway?
emangamer: you sir, have no soul. How can you hate the adorkable filly that is Twist!?
Woonanon: Well, I certainly don't have anything against her.
10,02Lol, I wonder if i could try streaming remotely from my iPad...
Big Mac used to be a type of hero
I will link it again becuase it is so funny
http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Who+is+god%3F
And then retired
I don't hate her, but I don't much care for her either.
a hero?
Woonanon: I DO! She not my faviorite, but I still think she's awesome
Like a Superhero
lol, thats funny :D
Woonanon: But thinking that she is a bitch without explaining why beyond "I just do" doesn't make any sense.
/me flipps Kammerjunk over a table
I don't think she is a bitch.
No, emangamer does.
can you elaborate on it?
who's a bitch?
At least I can understand why some would hate Trixie.
dont ask
Though I still think they're a tad vocal about it.
Well, in fanon he's brave, dashing, strong, fast, smart
The grrrrreat and powerful Trrrrrixie is a great pony.
Kammerjunk: Do you want me to hate you forever?
/me slapps Woonanon
Her Voice is the best.
dont EVER say that again
emangamer: Dearly, my Frank, I don't damn a give.
I.
Love.
Trixie.
We still talking bout twist?
mmhmmm
/me stabbs Kammerjunk
/me several times
Trixie's voice is orgasmic
^
lol
*backe away from emangamer* 0_o
I am rage quitting
And Lesson Zero confirmed a good 3/5ths of those
Okay.
Have fun.
due to all of this trixie and bitch love
So much for tolerance, eh?
but seriously I must depart
he does show the charecterstics of being a hero, it just seems to me like he wouldnt have enough screen time to portray a huge backstory
Kammerjunk: I can only tolerate so much
err....bye...
bye everypony <3
emangamer: Bye...:(
bye
emangamer: Suit yourself.
Bye
10,02Bai emangamer!
besides his love of the doll, which could show something
Kammerjunk: I think you are taking this conversation a little too seriously
/me gives SuperBrony64|AFK a quick smack on the flank
emangamer: see you, soulless demon
emangamer: I am?
ah, emangamer you leavin?
10,02O___o
RAWRity: <3
also, emangamer, have you read Mod 3?
I'm not the one calling Twist a bitch just beacuse, though.
because*
I wonder if the ponies will ever get welsh dubs...
RAWRity: you should show off your epic pony meme to rainbowheaven our new member
There needs to be more Trixie in season 2.
RAWRity: and no I havent
Woonanon: I agree.
/me glares at Woonanon with his hand ready to slap
Wuh. 6_9
trixe should at least get a mention
I stand by my opinion.
rainbowheaven: RAWRity is the other ponymeme guy
I like the idea of Big Mac being a retired superhero. Like Watchmen or The Incredibles or something
or the bronies should push for her, like derpy
Oh... well okay then..
I don't like Trixie because I think her personality is likable, I like her because she is a good character for a show.
/me hugs RAWRity "I am off. I shall read your then bye <3"
hmm, he seemed very happy.
i see it now
I just love her voice, and she is quite unique
Quite
RAWRity: He did?
/me spins magic staff then is envlepoped in a teal bubble of sparkling light.
hi everypony!!
Eh, I just find her annoying, I don't hate Trixie, but I don't like her ether.
I'mm off to see the Wizard
See ya all!
>_>
the wonderful wizard?
Kammerjunk: what with all the tildes and hearts and whatnot.
Ictiv: BYE!!
bye Ictiv, stay on that yellow brick road
im gonna laugh if some of this turns out to be true
goodbye yellow brick road?
I had to come back because WHAT THE HELL RAWRity ???
Darf14: Road? The way I'm going, I don't need roads.
that was uncalled for
lol
I'm going in STYLE!
emangamer: what?
Oh hi, fluttercry.
RAWRity: I am not whiney, I am complainy
/me dematerializes as the teal bubble around him bursts.

"Big Mac! What are you doing?!" *Cut to him holding the up the CMC in one hoof and keeping a Timberwolf at bay with another."
:)

Asmalya: be careful of spoilers
Woo! Chicken Pot Pie! I haven't had this stuff in years.
Asmalya: Oh dear.
emangamer: um...okay? I also said Scootachicken was too british, which I dont' think is possible.
Spoiler? uh...
RAWRity: but he IS too british
okais...
oh crud! The time! sorry got to go make money for a guy with a tie
*takes bite* OH MY CELESTIA!! This stuff is awesome!
Lol.
Asmalya: posting anything that hints about a future episode technically counts as a spoiler, and we try to avoid those here.
RAWRity: you continually make fun of michale bay dont you?
I also hear that episode 16 has ponies
that would be amazing
duh
Double rainbow Syndrome :D
lol
As a rule of thumb, don't talk about an episode until a couple hours after it's aired.
MidnightBolt: No way.
rainbow blitz
You're kiddin.
emangamer: only a couple of times.
Best...PMV...EVER....
where?
"Nothin' AppleJack!"
MidnightBolt: Woah, never saw that coming.
I know right
but what would his superhero nickname be?
and bronystate has 24HR spoiler rules

I didn't get banned
what gave you that idea?

rainbowheaven: how do you do that italic thing?
/me hugs emangamer
RAWRity: no...I have never once yelled "It's friday night"
emangamer: remember that this is a trailer, so a lot of things can happen/change from 1 to the next, since the entire movies are only available inside my brain.
/me hugs otakon...I guess
you do /me then wutever
Stupid internet...
should we ask the mane chat?
ACK! So one hel- actually, I don't mind.
RAWRity: well then you and I TOGETHER can make the entire movies

Sure, just don't give out the whole thing at once
/me is tired of his internet not being paid for and having to steal from the neighbors...
Cy, me too
do I type me, or my name?

Just ask for somepony if they would be interested in writing a story about Big Macintosh

RAWRity: what do you mean?
Fack...
well
ok

/me takes another bite of pot pie
emangamer: doing like an Audio Play of the trailers.
Well, I gotta go. Cya guys later
hey, does anyone have any interest on writing a fanfic about Big Macintosh?
RAWRity: you said Ekips opens THEIR mouth shouldn't it be his mouth?
HEY GUYS
but we are in agreement on that this needs to be read aloud

otakon: there is a digital skype recorder somewhere

How about we keep it in mind and try to find someone to do it as time goes on
Perhaps on movie night

And it's bugging me to no end.
Perhaps a one-off charactor we haven't seen much of
RAWRity: SERIOUSLY I think you and I are in hivemind. I just recently, like in the past 4 days, have started cracking my knuckles
8,1MadxHatter123: dari did, but it was on the stream and no-one recorded it
Like Pipsqueek!

Kammerjunk: that makes two of us :P
Aww, because I feel heartless that me just reading it didn't make me cry, but it almost did, just like my little dashie...
I mean, "du" means "you".
RAWRity: can you imagine what would happen if we collaborated... *shivers*
You know, Pip! The pirate from the Nightmare Night special?

It appears so
Right. I have now decided to contact any and all newspapers I can get hold of in Denmark and tell them of SOPA and ACTA, because no one in Denmark gets it.

Gumri: It's a very important High school test in the middle of the year..

You say that like it's a bad thing
Brawny: finals are at the end of the year... hence "FINAL"
They call them finals here

Dear RAWRity, ... Signed DashWithRainbows
Of course, it's just a theory. Who's saying that she didn't go to Tahiti?
http://i.imgur.com/BfSgr.jpg
found it
DashWithRainbows: stop taking it out of context!
But I prefer to stay in the dark
because Tahiti dosent have a pony related pun in it
i didnt say i was bro.
i was merely trying to process what was goin' on.
DashWithRainbows: hello =)
Why is the stream not up? i don't understand.
Hey...StickySyrup...
Gumri: stream? wut stream?
/me wonders if a skyrim stream would be of interest
Has anyone seen the new video from fox news?
And last time we saw her she essentially swore revenge
yes it would Wrek!
05,15A skyrim stream would be of much interest
do it Wrek :)
Why is Eman crying... again?~
Or am I remembering Trixie?'
And why is my chat broken?~
Skyrim...excuse me while i watch paint dry but go ahead. Alot of skyrim lovers here from what i can tell.
too many new people he says
fox news have done another thing on Bronies
/me listens to fluttershy's endless "yays"
051 sec
huh~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Uk5ddR2y2l0
this is'nt nice ='(
I'm not watching that
It'll get my blood boiling
Time to watch the video...
Which is bad
Y do they judge us... it's not fair
They're fox news
i think they both did
sry stinkomanfan i gtg do some chores
Aha fox news! the completely unbias media company!
K bye
Why do they hate ='(
they don't understand.
the guy that is at BroNYCon...trying to grab my attention...but paint drying...sorry but im going to go watch grass grow instead
paint drying < grass growing
Ok they chose like some of the most enthuasistic bronies
Dis video...
Funfact! Griffins in anceint mythology ate horses
I don't even have to pay attention to newsl any news that's relevant to mew trickles down into the places I frequent
like bronystate
mew*
me*
I dont mind the whole dressing up thing, but it only makes others think we are complete crazy people
hello
So now Gilda is twice as... threatening
I'm going to go set something on fire now
what did I just walk into?
Brawny: dude, I wanna so join u
I could have gone without the costumes in bronycon
we r not happy Dken2021
fox news have done another bullshit report on us
is it the redeye thing?
yeah
Fox's reports on us are so funny though
still, they cant bring us down
/me brohoofs
Damn you Fox news~!
I don't equate frustrating close-mindedness with humor, pince-dari
they are funny
Dat video... I CAN"T BELEVE IT!
well in case you don't know, redeye isn't that much of a big deal, plus it's late night tv so many people won't watch that late
I mean damn, if we're worse than terrorists without even trying, kind of an insult to all them terrorists trying their best. :P
doesn't take much effort to be a terrorist
05,15We're worse than terrorists what?
Yeah, that too
/me glares at otakon's beard...
13all the national media is a joke
Love and tolerance > bombs and guns
Its just someting to report on... because they know they have nothing that anyone cares about
what?
DashWithRainbows: Indeed~
We know what to do guys.
I trimmed it
CNN is the only news I watch
it's less powerful now
13local fox affiliates are usually much much better because they aren't beholden to the 24-hour cycle
otakon: that wont stop it...nothing can stop it
lol
BBC news (cause im a brit)
or Sky news
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsSjpQjfi6c
hahah
emangamer: I give up I solved the brain parts, but the ones that invlove skill... I can't~
emangamer: I tired~
lol better than terriorism
Fox news like picking on things like Bronies because the majority of their viewerbase is 40-somethings who think the internet is voodoo and witchcraft and anything different from themselves is bad and scary.
Nyria: which ones?
Agreed?
emangamer: sure let's go with that.
right i'll be back in a bit people. bye for now
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBFOcB1g5E&feature=related

Nyria: the vortex is the most fun
Who did I ban? O_o
lol silly mod
Nyria: you can look up a walk through for the vortex

RAWRity: can you link it agian?
emangamer: you shoulda seen it when he found out who I cast for him!
I did, I swear, I could not get it~
Yeah, I won't read anything with such vulgar words as 'Matt Smith'.
i want to see what you did...
DashWithRainbows: can you download it?
/me ninja glomps everyone
Mods, you should stream Burn Notice on netflix.

Will Smith is cool.
Because he's the fresh prince.

Dari is black?
So princess dari

He can be anything we want~
Nah, we need a real british accent for dari. You cant fake the sexiness.

byebye IshBestKitty

/me purrs and rubs against StickySyrup
Anyone elses stream lagging bad?
/me smiles :)
Well, at every level or two you get to choose something that adds something to your charactor
ta ta IshBestKitty ~
/me scratches up StickySyrups sofa very badly
Bad IshBestKitty
They are more based on a particular skill e.g: a marksman perk is to slow down time when you aim
lol
/me purrs and rubs against Nyria
you dead
Awww... Adorable~
/me oh well,
/me scolds IshBestKitty
otakon mew :'(
/me squirts IshBestKitty with a spraybottle
heya people
Well
/me pets IshBestKitty ~
11,14 Wrek go boom
mroooooow
that's what happens when you DON'T WEAR ARMOR OR HEAL!
fus ro dah?
mew :'(
/me gets out a laser pen... shines infront of IshBestKitty
HEAL YOU THICK SWEDE!
05,15He was wearing steel
What level is wrek
fluttercry: yeah, BOOTS
/me chases laser
Gumri: 6
that's better
/me SQUEEEE
05,15and a chest plate
finally!
Why is he even trying to free the dude?
And some earings~
i have dragon stuff lol
/me realizes he can't afoord this game yet...
I think~
/me snuggles with IshBestKitty
Gumri: for the hell of it
Ah, so it's not "50% damage with fire related weapons" sort of things
/me purrs and rubs against rainbowheaven
Daedric armour is better than dragon
no
but dragon is easyer to get
Ooo~
/me gives IshBestKitty catnip
true Gumri but Dragon is easier to get
yay~!
/me noms catnip
Not if you wear light armor
cant find a single dreadra
05,15Yeah that pissed me off. I spent all this time maxing out dragon armor and it's not that great
what shout was that?
/me purrs and rubs against everything
05,15also daedric stuff is easy to get if you know where to farm hearts and ebony
use you ranged spell!
This feels just like fallout~ without guns~
/me cleans up IshBestKitty's fur
/me gives IshBestKitty a slap for making the place stink
mew :'(
Alright, I'm going to have to check it out
what?
fluttercry: I like it, but arent' the pieces randomly generated and the hearts and ebony fairly rare?
Nyria: was just thinking that, only seen a lets play though
/me slaps gumri for smacking IshBestKitty
you can just buy ebony
D: Dont hurt the kitty Gumri
Phase4: Same here as well~ I want the game~
/me purrs and rubs against rainbowheaven
I found the PC port for Skyrim to be really terrible
hearts seem like the hard part
05,15Hearts are always at Mehrunes Dagon's shrine. Ebony can be found in a mine and bought. that's all you need
my character is stealth
meow
cause x36 sneak attacks are fun
my character is a tank
/me soothes IshBestKitty and yells at Gumri
11,14 more rank 1/2/3/4/5 of the first bow skill can give you 20/40/60/80/100% extra bow damage, skill 2 lets you zoom in with the bow, 3 slows time
I love fist fighting~!
Ziltoid: if you go to the highest point in the game... there is a ore vien with a enchanted pix axe that has ebony ore
/me turns back into IshBestPony and knocks Gumri out
All Wrek needs now is a handel bar mustache~!
it's also a reference to notch
the maker of minecraft
oh yeah I read about that
Ah, so they're preset
i haz the notched pickax
05,15I'm still skeptical about that
Wrek, we have apony with a question about the skill trees, can you pull it up when you get a chance?
its fun
Need to go back
MakerDusk is best maker.
oh the nothed pickaxe?
bai everypony
oh shit a kitty just knocked me out! how'd that happen :D
bye ba IshBestPony
/me cheers IshBestPony on. "Go IshBestPony!
fluttercry, bethesda had a whole copyright debacle with notch over one of his games
exactly
ta ta IshBestPony ~
bye IshBestPony
it makes sense that they would reference him
05,15yeah i know. so why give him a shout out
/me hugs Dken2021 and rainbowheaven and Nyria and StickySyrup
maybe it's a srt of apology?
sort*
/me hugs IshBestPony back~
bethesda has always been a pretty cool company
Why not is a better question
Aw thanks. *HUGS Back*
/me
/me also hugs IshBestPony back
11,14 each tree affects the different skill areas, with some of the talents only accessible when you level it up enough
So... what's Wrek trying to do here? Free a slave without killing it?
Oh look it's IshBestPony again :)
10,022 Min Break from class :3

11,14 I think he was trying to free the prisoner, 1 of the 2 main story factions, without accidentally hitting him
I ~ Know ~ --->

I can remember when i wanted to be a mod but then realised im too lazy :D
10,02Uh-oh, break is over.

rainbowheaven: he has his computer on in class? I dunno
18
Hey LunaTheBeloved ~
Guys, I have to be honest with you, I don't feel 100% right now. I have to take a nap to refresh my head. Today has been just a long day...
oh lol im not even that yet
Oh lord, Scoot-Scootaloo do what you must. All I have to say is get better and that we care~
Go ahead Scoot-Scootaloo <3
/me offers Scoot-Scootaloo some hot choclate
Rest your head
StickySyrup: Okay. I'm not allowed personal technology in my school, so..
Hi Nyria, bye Scoot-Scootaloo
rainbowheaven: :) no matter
Okay~!
did he sell his loot yet?
rainbowheaven: what kind of school is it?
05,15Why the tilde! I don't understand!
I know a kid who is 12 and watches MLP, does he count as a brony?
Because it's classy~
High School
that was close
rainbowheaven: kl
05,15Well there's your problem rainbowheaven
like a boss
So... how does leving work here? Standard kill and get XP?
hurry up and kill a dragon so u can Fus people around
Kill certain ways and get xp for ranks?
Yeah. But my older bro is a senior and he's allowed to bring his laptop!:'(
every successful hit
11,14 levelling the different skills gets you overall levels
Wait somebody is using 'u' as a word?~ Oh... right where on the internet~
Oh so you can level up mid battle
who be playan?
Wrek: ~
I mean
Wrek is~
11,14 use 1-handed weapons, raise 1-hand skill, bows->bows, fire magic-> destruction magic, etc
hey
rainbowheaven: :'(
11,14 it's pretty common to level mid-battle actually
one hit with a sword gets xp, one fireball gets xp.
Oh yes and hey Dermathil ~
But i'm a freshman so i guess that explains things..
11,14 you get some nice kill animations on the power attacks sometimes too
Why do people now have a ~ at the end of sentences?
~
Gumri: that's Nyria's derpthingy
Does he even have a limit on things he can carry?
I dont get it^
Not just Nyria though
Nyria made it first
yes
11,14 like one of the 1-handed skills lets you decapitate npcs with a power blow if you're using a sword
It's fairly high though
but it has no meaning?
hey there there~ '~' is a free key~ I like it when other people use it~ But not to many people~
11,14 until you kill a few dragons, most of their drops are really heavy
loot ALL the food
I thik I started that, Gumri. I typed Okay~!
Uh...
just thought of something: Magypsie Ponies. Internet, make it happen
I've been doing it for a long time~
Nyria: Story time?
you have to store their stuff
I can imagine, them being huge and all
About 1 2 3 4 5 6 7... 8... 9 weeks~
I think~
Nyria: oh.... :$
Guys, does a 12 year old count as a brony?
Duh~
Yes~
of coourse
bronies come in all ages
Hey wut do u mean me?
not too young?
some would say he is too old
no.. of course not
"Im 12 and what is this"
sorry ignore me
11,14 I'm not in a rush to restart my skyrim game until they drop the next patch, just lost a save file this weekend
im just being an idiot
but yes, everybody should be allowed to be a brony
. . . You do know of my age right~
11,14 135 hours shot to a corrupt file
or a pegasister
if they is female
...
Uh oh...
Erm
05tohugh a 12 yo brony is still a 12 yo, henceforth likley to be annoying.
What is Uh oh~
but be careful, the chat is pg-13
I CAN"T SEE MY POSTS!
I think the term "pegasister" is non valid
So, workbenches fix armor and grindstones for weapons?
why?
12 year olds are borderline target demographic
some people prefer pegasister though
I dont really hear people say pegasister much.
11,14 upgrades them, no durability in the game
I am so slow with internet terminology
that is what i think Dermathil
true
:[
I suddenly want this game
05,15There was a kid in my highschool that was 12
but Brony is gender neutral for the most part as how I see
maybe this site should be called "PegasisterState"
A Brony is just a older fan of the show
11,14 it is a good one, regardless of the bugs
still.. pegasister does sound kinda cool
There Much better....:| i hates my computer
the bro code says that women can be bros as well.
nah, too wordy
For some reason, I just prefer brony.
so, who's complaining about a 12 year old?
il brb
Gonna have to remember this when dealing with buying a video game :s
Brony is unisex IMO.
^
eeyup
also, hungry...must get food...
gender neutral
Brony...Pegasisiter...I personally don't mind either one
*Sister
ah, doing that Eqd trainning thing null?
no one is complaining otakon i was just wondering if they counted as bronies or if they are too young
oh yeah
at this point anyone outside the original demographic
i.e. 10 year old girls
and NullRadix
Hey
is a brony for the most part
Get it on the Xbox though I found the PC version to be irrortating
Fine thanks, you?
pretty good
I see the bot is gone
/me reading some Bleach/MLP crossover comic
I'm just glad to be back tbh
Sounds intresting rainbowheaven ~
My net was out yesterday
It sucked
sell all the food Wrek!
Food can be good sometimes
Should I play video games or should I stay here~ Uh...
yeah
early on
Nyria: I don't know
evening Phase4
Nyria > both
oh NullRadix the pic is looking good
11,14 PC will give you the mods and dev tools, console will probably give you better visuals
okay, brb again
the pic is... done...
I dont have anymore time for it!
Well... I can't do both~
or other things
Delphine is a wizard
Oh crap i just found a gitantic cut on my elbow... No idea how that happened
Nyria: then your setup is lacking and you either need more monitor(s) or your TV closer to your computer
but anyway
NullRadix: True...
True but it is a really, really bad port
Gumri: I hate when that happens~
Gumri: that happens to me to
other places to go... before coming back and finding new ATG assignment
and it has 4 times as many bugs
tends to be my hands of feet though
/me is back
ok back
/me dives out the door
Hey Cyanide ~
hi Cyanide
Cyanide: hello
Hihi Cyanide
/me is upset because someone crashed into his car today
Hey everypony ~ ;3
What's this 'anide' at the end of your name Cy~
D: Oh that stinks, StickySyrup
/me and drove away ='(
What about Oblivion and it's differences?
Oh StickySyrup ...
/me hugs StickySyrup ~
11,14 do you mean the console version or the pc version Gumri?
Was the damage bad?
Nyria: Cyanide, it's a poison. It's what Cy is shortened from
the PC version
Oh look. A game I never played.
thanks =) it was the left door and the wheel arch
There there StickySyrup ~ It will get better~
about £400
I have both, Xbox and PC versions before you start lectureing me :)
and Cyanide I didn't know about that~
05,15Cy does that include happiness?
11,14 the elder scrolls games used to be developed for the pc, then ported :(
Lol.
Im so fustrated I could screem: ahhh (in fluttershy's voice)
11,14 that's the talent menu
fluttercry: No, I home craft poisons in my free time
Oblivion was vastly superior on the PC
Wrek, will you download the ponies mod for skyrim?
I got to ask, does a different thing play in each thearter, or is it playing in all of them?
it would make a good stream =P
All the same
ok
I put on one where dragons are fluttershy... Took it off when i realised i had to kill them.
Interesting idea though
I wanna watch rainbow dash fight a dragon
No... Put dragons on where all of them are Randy savage~
or pinkie pie
Gumri: I would never be able to kill fluttershy
Ziltoid: I would pay to see that
exactly
o btw I bought my first MLP today =)
you dont have to
go to youtube
StickySyrup: Awww! Which one?
Yeah~!
Which one?~
It is the funniest thing though when you are walking around and all you hear is "YAY"
LadyCanary: I got fluttershy
But is Oblivion for the XBox 360 still good?
Nice~
Good choice~
yeah it's great
So, is this skyrim or oblivion?
<3 Fluttershy~
they were running out though...
other bronies got there before me and took RD
skyrim
Alright, that is all I needed to know
I asked shop assistant lol
I want one so bad...
ah, ok.
StickySyrup: How did you ask him?~
fuck the thalmor
might seem a little outdated now though
Either Fluttershy or Rarity.
kill the thalmor
all elves must die
I don't know when I'lll be able to start my pony collection. Maybe sometime after I finally get a job.
For the emporor
Oi im a Dark Elf
Why can't i post a link? :'(
lol.. I went up and said: Do u have anymore of these? and pointed at the pic of RD
"Hey, your out of Rainbowdash ponies... I don't like stores where they don't have rainbow dash..." *puts on sunglasses*
she said: nope sold out yesturday
Holy crap...
Meh, Outdated things can still be fun
StickySyrup: Heh, I would totally do that, but with fluttershy.
very true.
seeing as we dont get MLP in UK (only very rarely) and they sold out of MLP....
My bronie sences are tingling
/me has a pinkie brushie~
Ah, that sucks.
/me is back and glad to see what is being streamed! :)
Somepony? HELP!:'(
Hey RaveBrony ~
Yes rainbowheaven ?~
MLP stuff doesn't come around here either
But at least you got one, StickySyrup.
whats up rainbowheaven
true =)
Just because Dr Mario is old doesn't mean it's a bad game, Ditto for pong
Hi, Nyria :P
never really played as nord racial power seems rigged
I had a suprisingly good time with pong actually
Yeah, I'm playing arkham asylum while watching this.
I want to show you guys a pic, but i can'y post a link for some reason!
Did you copy and paste?~
omg number 19 is good!
I copied, buti can't paste
Ctrl V? rainbowheaven
Uh, try again~ It works~
Lol.
oh.. i'll try again
when in doubt, Ctrl V.
Remember... PG13~
dat arrow
When homework is needed, Ctrl C + Ctrl V
Not the knee~!
oh loll
nope.... doesn't work
does it have to be PG13 even if the game is a 15?
Id rather die!!
StickySyrup: ewwwww, homework.

This is how it all starts really
Gumri: I agree.
did anyone else click the screen

I did earlier.
StickySyrup: watch out for that
I just did -.-
I have done it about 3 times now
mips.tv is a jerk about that

Don't do it man. If you do, Fluttershy will give you, The Stare.

Ziltoid: I get too distracted by the crazy number of side quests

There is no end to skyrim

LunaTheBeloved: <3

Lovecraft is epic
I dont think we have ever met before Gumri
Shizuka: anything I can do to help loosen your load?
No, i dont reconise you either StickySyrup

Im in the uk also :)
The names just sound silly
I'm knew to StickySyrup:
Then they tazed me in t butt.....over and over and over

So if you call one of them BumTazer, shouldn't the other one be "CandyBar"?
the Resident Evil Revelations Demo is bullshit
/me its nice to meet all the new Bronies Ive never met before =)
no continue
and it times out if you let it sit too long
How long have you been coming on Bronystate StickySyrup
THat resident evil 6 trailer is sick
AND it only has 30 uses on it
bout 2 weeks... once everyday
you can only play the demo 30 times!
is it wrong that after about four days I recognize most of you
I think I've been here since nevember
nope
that's a good thing
no not really
I think anyone in Ye Olden Days who was named Dovahkiin would be mocked in the villiage
YOu should feel terrible
bad pony
that's nice HeavyMetalDash
I reconise my regulars in here and my Twilight room people on movie night
I know HeavyMetalDash
we are usually online at the same time

nope, none of the fics i read
I wish I could give back more to the Bronie community...

because, poachers live there
remind me what's so gret about this game?
Wrek sure did "pick" a good game to stream
ohai oh taaaay kahn
ikr I'm on the edge of my seat
WOOO!
twi?
/me pronounces that name like that only when Wrek is here
CRASH!
brb
uh oh
Woah, it's twilight.
ah
^
so that's wat happened
RAge quit??
And that is why you don't want Skyrim on the PC
twi is Dovahikin
I think she closed the game
lol^
I continually feel the ugre to try /me in FB chat but then I realize it doesn't work
lolI did it on skype
lol
I keep coming close to saying "everypny" in public
*Everypony
Anyone hear about anonymous attacking FB soon? O_o
Eeeyup.
StickySyrup: No silly, fluttershy is Dovahikin
RAWRity: You mean besides it being one of the better modern RPGs in existence? Not much really
RaveBrony wha?
When I was asked to Identify the band AfroJack... I accerdently said Applejack! LoL
Anon are epic
RAWRity: did you join that NC brony group?
Anonymous plans to attack and shut down FB since its theyre enraged
"are they applejack?"... um no.. who is applejack
CriticKitten: that 5 minutes of slowly...sloooooowwwwwlllllyyyyyyyyy mining sure seemed like the most fun I've had in years!
Argh, wrong button
Heck, hadn't even touched the Elder Scrolls series until I first heard of Skyrim (and bought Oblivion) and even I can admit they're good games.
lol like a boss
LunaTheBeloved, I do the same!! Almost said it in class today xD
daedric armour looks so beast in Skyrim compared with Oblivion.
Fus Ro Dah ALL the children
What, you prefer your mining to be "click and done", thus defeating the whole "realism" aim they're going for?
lol
SKyrim realistic?
lolwut
05ORITE WAS CRAFTIGN MY ARSE OFF
Skyrim isnt remotely realistic
05tiem to sell shit
If it takes a little longer, who cares? Are you that concerned about rushing around to kill dudes? :p
lol! Over encumbered
/me is preparing for work now
Get the steed stone!!!
CriticKitten: if realism comes coupled with unending boredom, I'll take the hit.
/me ded
best stone
Wooo! go sell that stuff!
10,02WREK
10,02What are you playing? :>
I have watched that bloody Italian intro about 15 times now...
:o
I love how people jump on my comment without thinking. Now let's try again. Yes, compared to some RPGs out there, it most certainly is closer to realism. >_>
...
Is it 100% realistic? Well no, but no game is. That's the point.
/me looks at SB and facehoofs
It being a game and all.
omg lol guna take a while
10,02Why the facehoof? D:
But it's pretty obvious Skyrim aims for a "realistic" bent, and it doesn't do a bad job of that.
guys I think Wrek got dc'd
just tele to the front doors of whiterun!
it's not about killing dudes, it's about a game being fun to play, and this...doesnt' look fun. this looks ungodly dull.
it's Skyrim SB
Well, its only if you really dont know what hes playing :o
I don't know what he's playing......
:P
:o :o
Me either :P
he's playing Pokemon of course.
...
I can sing the Italian intro i have watched it that many times...
SKyrim!
is this GTA?
I thought it was Mario.....
oh i love pokemon
Lol....you trolls xD
Skyrim? Never heard of that
So the massacre of people just a few minutes ago is overruled by the ten second mining sequence, RAWRity? Whatever ya say bro, to each their own I guess.
xD
"Go kill 10 Giant Rats and I'll buy your armor."
this is clearly dragon quest
10,02I didnt know cause im not watching the stream ;___;
Is this medal of honor, modern black ops 3?
well SuperBrony64|AFK it's dead
He might not have been wat.... ninja'd

Hi Flutterguy :3
saying goodnight to people is SO hard sometimes!
/me picks up Luna the beloved and beloves her
ello Flutterguy
<3
RAWRity: Some RPGs don't boil down to "kill dudes, kill more dudes" ad infinitum. Some incorporate a lot of tasks that feel "normal" as part of the goal to get you integrated and invested in the world and your character. If you don't like those sorts of games that's cool, but don't be ridiculous and say that they can't be enjoyable.
ohai FlutterBro13|Shower

I can sing the Italian intro but i have absolutely no idea what im saying :D

/me hugs SuperBrony64|AFK
sometimes i swear to god you are high SB :D
CriticKitten: I'm not saying it has to be about killing dudes. It could be about anything if it was enjoyable. Skyrim, to me, just doesn't seem like much fun for all the hype it's been given.
I can't take naps either ;_;
My friend's cat loves to sleep on her Xbox controller xD
SuperBrony64: I'll sing you a lullaby if you want?
fluttercry: agreed
Awww look at the frost troll

better yet, we'll al get Fluttershy to sing you one.

Ah, there he is

I used to have 2 cats... One was called Hitler.
*sighs* My kitty passed away a while ago, I miss my three legged kitty...
Phase4: how can you not love ANY XKCD
mew
emangamer: i dont, i love all of them
and the more i learn the more love there is
so much EQD
meh, never been much for that sort of thing
meh: ohai there
RAWRity: As I said, if you don't like that sort of game, 'scool. Just don't be a doofus about it and make it sound like it can't possibly be enjoyable. Some people really get into this sort of thing, to the point where they're having fun decorating their house. I'm not very into decoration and prefer function to pretty, but it's what makes these games enjoyable for some.
ohai

where has he been for the past three weeks?
like seriously?
lmao RAWRity
RAWRity: that makes the entire series better
Kodiak, he's building giant killer robots
apparently o-o
RAWRity that would've been my first guess
disenchant so you can enchant something else Phase4
maybe he is waiting in Africa...
XD
mew
LOL eeeyup
RAWRity, No way Twilight Saga could have a character that cool
nyan?
Gumri: i figured as much, but selling them and buying blank boots seems like a better way to go
/me purrs and rubs against RAWRity
Frosty would give everyone the cold shoulder
/me pulls out a bag of catnip.
Meow
goddamitSATbot, why you so soon? XP
RaveBrony: Hasbro needs to make plushes to sell to us, well, those of us who can't sew.
I want to see The Twilight Saga now with Frosty edited in

FOR CLARITY: There are two movies and Two Episodes and Two Movies Each Movie Night. So no "Y U NO SHOW PONEHZ"
yeah
and during the weekdays it's potluck
I heard that at least a thousand times from the Pinkie room
ello ther mistress Shy
anything from games
it gets annoying
The World needs more ponies! especially more of Derpy!
otakon: I am giving fluttershy an IRC introduction course
rainbowheaven: I like the status of derpy before the newest episode
have we covered the No Spoiler rule for the newbies?
RAWRity: I dont think so
emangamer: Why? SHE SPEAKS NOW!
Another rule: The only acceptable Ship here is ShizuVi (or however Shizuka says it). NO OTHER SHIPS PERIOD.
13vizuka
^
13because vivi comes first
that
But I ship DerpyHooves` and Cy`
Ha ha.
rainbowheaven: because I like her when she was an easter egg for us fans... and another longer explaination that I can give you in PM

Nevar.

Dashie_Dashie: because that's saved for Bans
/me starts turning her favorite anime character into a pony
ohhhhhhh :o
rainbowheaven: you double click the name you want to pm, and you close that window by right-clicking the name on the bottom of the chat window, underneath the text entry box.
13why kick when you can precision strike with an orbital high energy particle cannon
rainbowheaven I take it you're an anime fan?
OKay..i know..
Yes
though Valthejean chooses to use a Trident that makes people explode.
Why do ppl like anime? I never watched an episode
Shizuka doesn't miss.
We also kick with wub from time to time...
rainbowheaven: you like Gurren Lagann?
but thats only on special ocassions
Never heard of it...
/me starts heading for the Bunker
rainbowheaven: WHAT!?
Gurren Laggan?!
WHERE?
FluttershyOHYEAH11: then it's no wonder you don't understand why people like anime.
Row row rice and flour.
otakon: sry....:(
:O
13no place is safe from orbital wrath
^
/me breaks out my rage-drill
rainbowheaven: no worries, we must introduce you to it's epicness is all
13so the smart money is on not invoking wrath :)
/me runs
Ohai otakon
Giga....
Wrath=bad
/me launches into space
hello randome pony
Drill....
to the MOOOOOOOONNNNN
I don't know you....
BREAK!!!!
What Anime SHould I start watching?
/me peirces the heavens
Shizuka wouldn't take wrath out on me though :3
Come to the Moon, it gets lonely up here some times
FluttershyOHYEAH11: it depends on the anime. I like DBZ kinda and YYH somewhat but past that
no place? not even under the desk at my school?
mmmmmbananas
/me heads toward the moon
FluttershyOHYEAH11: I suggest FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood, good anime.
FluttershyOHYEAH11: I would suggest Yu Yu Hakusho
13if you did something bad i would
otakon: I'm more of a follower of the popular animes.
Start by watching GURREN LAGGAN
D:
13it is not fun to have to dispense wrath
/me puts out a giant mattres out for Cy
Shizuka: unless you are power hungry
/me starts sobbing on the way to the moon
Gurren Laggan is awesome, so is Angel Beats
^
rainbowheaven: it's GAINAX! it is definitely one of the most, well amazing shows you'll ever see
FluttershyOHYEAH11: depends on what you like. Are you more in to heavy action, or character studies, comedy? drama?
/me misses the mattress and hits into the surface
11,14I get to nom on ponies hit by Shizuka's wrath
rainbowheaven ever watched Cowboy Bebop?
Ouch.....my bad
otakon: Gainax isn't exactly a seal of approval.
AnSooo Whats the BEST Anime?
Gainax has a tendency to half-bake their shows.
GASP
true
Dken2021: Yeah. My big brother actually like that naime
but GL is NOT half baked
*anime
LunaTheBeloved: Tis all good
More rules: dont upset the dari-bot. PM uncle otakon for more information on that
11,01Don't worry if you get put on the moon. You have SO MANY FRIENDS there.
/me hugs Cy
yeah
/me hugs LunaTheBeloved
>_<
I don't mind questions and I'll do my best to help you out.
Theres a Dolphin ride on the moon!
I'm here on the Moon, by choice though
and BENDER!
and MOON PIES!
/me rides moon dolphin
11,01And awesome songs by Tiny Tim.
I like the moon.
But I like the sun more.
I like it here better, it quieter. :3
If only I could be so grossly incandesant. . .
brb
GUYS I have a theory, I dont think that Luna was actually on the SURFACE of the moon. If you watch episode one when the stars combine the mare in the moon symbol on the moon dissappears. Maybe she was trapped "inside" it like the Man in the moon. (hence mare in the moon)
I plan to start working on Luna Land pretty soon up here.
Can any Alicorn send me to the moon please?
you and your crazy theroies
who wants a free burger?
Luna spent 1000 years at the Lunar Theme Park
/me gets out blueprint papers and starts drawing plans for Luna Land
LC would be more than happy to send you TO THE MOOOOOOONNNNNAAAAAH
/me 11,01kicks FluttershyOHYEAH11 to the moon.
Dken2021: it actually makes sense
ow...
/me points to a spot on the blue prints "We'll put the bumper cars here"
I was hoping something less painful
/me scribbbles that in
but OK Thanks!
FluttershyOHYEAH11: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh1_SQQIn9w
You got any ideas Cy?
/me looks over LunaTheBeloved's shoulder
Hmm, I suppose a whole section of Dolphin coin machines must go in somewhere
Wow...nice plans
Cy: makes sense
OKAY!
/me points to the corner "here looks good"
yes... otakon *bats his eyelashes like pinkie pie*
FOR WUT?
/me will be right back
Luna...tell...
rainbowheaven: dont be confused when Luna shows up. She is a mod while LunaTheBeloved is just a fair chatter
Perhaps the lunar launch pad.....
otakon x emangamer
Haur huar huar.
for ALL of those interested in a good starter anime!
okay..
http://www.hulu.com/search?query=Fullmetal+Alchemist%3A+Brotherhood&st=0&fs=

Yeeah what eman said
LawnchairRawket: I hate you
Okay...
/me snuggles LunaTheBeloved "I still WUB YOU though"
But what happened to Love and Tolerance?
Eeeeh? Ha ha ha!
emangamer x otakon's beard
/me tries to persuade LunaTheBeloved to put in a roller coaster to mars
/me nuzzles emangamer "I Wub you too!"
LawnchairRawket: you cant use that as an excuse to troll people
That could work.....
But I do anyway.
Again, sarcasam is my talent.
/me thinks we need to have an entire section on the moon for cheese...GET IT...cheese?
and mine is getting kicked by daribot!
no wait
that's not a talent!
< is that Vid thing a loading sign for anypony else?
We need a Merry-Go Round
Also, a rollercoaster to Mars? That's impossible.
GODDAMMITDARIBOT
FluttershyOHYEAH11: the stream is down atm
FluttershyOHYEAH11: that happens when no one is streaming
oh ok
My special talent is knowing how to troll the mods and get away with it.
/me starts packing crackers for moon trip
thx
dammit otakon ninja'd :[
eeyup
FluttershyOHYEAH11 it's loading screen: The animation
yeah
/me foams at mouth
RETURN of the BUFFER!
Dashie_Dashie: no...thankfully he is not here
enope
otherwise spam would ensue
eeyup
@spammeter chat
also, though I have no intention of writing them, I've come up with titles for Mod 4 and 5
but it would be fun spam
Return of the Buffer 2: Bugg harder
/me comes back and goes back to his plans
Chat is 1% SPAM
I think that does it for the blue prints.
Buff Harder even.

How do you know when your Too much of a brony? :P

there is no such thing

You can never be too much brony
13how terrifying ingwaz...
Thats rather ironic there, isn't it.
"Moder4tor: Fleur De LiES" "Moderator 5: The Wrekoning"
/me suggests a RollerCoaster to Mars
13although... afaik most glue is synthetic now..
thought that was lip balm for a second
I have 64K+ posts here on #bronystate
11,14he incurred Luna's wrath
the MOST of any other user
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wHqPsCN478
is that really something to be proud of?
That's getting a bit out of hand there, RAWRity .
13by phase's record at least
yes
oh, i laughed so hard once it kicked in why it should be disturbing
i mean, i want that spot too but...
I've also been kicked by daribot 80 times
13the logs are probably too big for me to set up irssistats again
LawnchairRawket: I'ma keep coming up with Punny titles.
EVERYONE that watches LRR/YGOTAS/DBZTAS needs to watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wHqPsCN478
otakon: watch that^
I am
Oh guys i gotta go. I have school tomorrow. I have to wake at 6. it's10:10 now. bye

Ah whoops.
rainbowheaven see ya
I accidently closed my tab.
bye rainbowheaven dont spend all day doodeling about ponies
/me walks into the chat and explodes
Bye rainbowheaven
Oh no, I was so worried.
Midnight_Tempest: why didn't you explode twice?
What, is the chat made of nitroglycern or something?>
/me finishes and show LunaTheBeloved. "Anything else?"
Or maybe Midnight_Tempest is water and the chat is potassium.
I think that's it, unless you can think of anything Cy
emangamer: well cause I just didn't feel like *explodes again*
otakon: did you enjoy that?
what was that?
...."cyber threats". I hope you don't mean certain bills that shall not be named, Obama. :|
I thinks thats good for now..

why did you buy me a watch?
11,01otakon: desu = it is. It's a copula.
ah
desu iz meme
11,01When desu flew about, I wanted to know what it meant, so I looked it up.
11,01Also, Rozen Maiden is a good anime.
13i loved rozen maiden... but now i can't watch it anymore
13cause i've used the background music in oblivion und morrowind for way too long
Nani?!? :|

RAWRity: seen it
11,01I saw the first season. Watched some of the second.
I've never seen Rozen Maiden.
Dken2021: BELIEVE IT!

/me has exclaimed "nani" before in public, and people don't get it.
:|
/me kick RAWRity. NO. :|
13note bene dken, "desu ka" is pronounced "deska" because the u in "su" is almost always silent
Dat lack of anime culture
13case in point "asuka"
RAWRity: what did I see?
emangamer: Welcome To The NHK
13itadakimasu is usually just "itadakimas"
but no seriously
11,01Suiseseki (sp?) is the character that ends half of her sentences in desu, which I think is a polite gesture.
Pity that SB isn't here, I think it's about time for some "taco taco~"
RAWRity: IDK but I've seen it
kirzstryfe: why did you buy me a watch!
one last time http://i.huffpost.com/gen/425512/GIANT-WETA-WORLDS-LARGEST-INSECT.jpg

Mitch Daniels is the reason public education in Indiana is going to die off in another decade or so. He's made the teaching profession undesirable. >_>

Not being happy is treason. Treason is punishable by death.

You need BLUE access to get those, NullRadix. Asking for items above your clearance is treason. Treason is punishable by death. Please report to the nearest termination booth. Thank you and have a nice day.
