Which pony is that on the right?
i dont want to be an emo anymore
pankreas yh i 99% sure its party with pinkie
RAWRity: :(
RAWRity: i want to save that Luna <:'(
it's likely a result of being familiar with too many wannabe goth girls in high school, but I absolutely hate the Pink/black combo.
Flutterbhitch Dashee
how much is he gonna charge you?
Whoever listened to this song and made a pirate remix was insanely creative
$150 I think..
like, every time I see it, I want to punch the person who made it.
ohai dash
No might be $200
obye dash
hi dashie
You know if thats cheap?
hell yeah
emo fluttershy seems like a more interesting character
awesome :p
RAWRity: hasbro made it orignally
>emo
>interesting
He showed me what the computer says he should charge
RAWRity: i think it doesn't fit her coat and eyes, but it's not that bad a combo otherwise
>yes
Its much higher than that price
That's one hell of a way to misspell irritating
>lol guise im implying xddd
Yo ho yo ho it's a PONY's life for me
>lol Epsilon
She shows up in one photo with that hairstyle in "Green is not your Color". We think Photo Finish was behind that magazine cover.

Scary Luna is best Luna

Dat a German Discord?
Applejack2011: i second that
Actually I enjoyed season 1 more than 3
but the text is prety boring

CrimsonPhoenix: what i'm saying, is that i found the first season a bit too easy and transparent
German. The angry language.
Since when can Luna chant a chorus?
Mozdoc: it's not!
DerpyMuffins: since forever
I'm trying to see if I can master the Soldier.
Back
Alright, ill talk with Toy

whoa.
i saw something gangam-related 14 times yesterday
pwn-pwn-pwnpwn pony got some style
for those of you who don't know: in this song Gangnam style is about how korean women should be treated with alot of respect because of what they do
this reminds me of endhiran

meh...better get back to my other midnight fun

HOORAY
flutterchu: he wasnt in G2
i hope there's no gen 4.5
how is she going to raise the sun?
dahling count: 5
princess myseria ....
Gangnam is a huge city in Korea that's like Hollywood. Gangnam Style is making fun of how the classy people love in that city. ...at least that's what I was told.
flutterchu: )~(
I heard someone claim that Oppan Gangnam Style was about ridiculing the upper-class. Yeah right.
Then she becomes a queen and everyone hates her
^ the end
flutterchu, that could be CMC spin-off
live in that city*
i am going to hit the hay now
i actually like g3 spike

Night Maid_RainBow
Hat: Breezies
flutterchu, G4.5 could be a CMC spin-off
Lol
CrimsonPhoenix: i beleve i understand now
ok. who requested ponies
que LoZ chest
To think that G3 Spike is just G4 Spike a thousand years later gives off Gunbuster vibes.
SOILDIER
THERE GONNA MAKE A FUCKING GEN4.5 :'(
perhaps G3 is AFTER G4
AJIsAwesome: i like how he walks with his claws behind his back, he's like a butler :3
timeline twist!
I think I requested
<.<
flutterchu: And?
KernelCobb: gen 4........never ends T_T
pewdiepie just uploaded a new vid guys.. brb
pewdiepie is overrated
brony90: oh boy
Derpy_Hooves: He would make an interesting alternate Spike if he had some more personality.
chuggaconroy all the way
twiddlie wink, tra la la....
seems legit
flutterchu: but in g4, spike is no more than 15 years old...can't be..g3 he's over 1000 years
ANOTHER DAMN SONG
I see a tra la la
Sorry, I prefer NCS.
brony90, is it wrong for me to not care about pewdiepie at all?
Chugga's too annoying for me.
CrimsonPhoenix: I don't care about him, so no
CrimsonPhoenix, not at all, thats normal
He's still a good lper, though.
DashWithRainbows AJIsAwesome: but if you two are asking for my personal fav, i prefer pcull44444
Ok. Song? Check. Lyrics? Check. VA who can't sing worth a half a damn? Double Check.
dat Spike song
DashWithRainbows: IKR? :S
I thank celestia that gen3.5 was not sucessful
ikr AJIsAwesome
I think G3 spike is the only good thing to come from this movie
Chuuga is kinda offensive to British people
CrimsonPhoenix, I don't mind if you don't care about pewdiepie
never mind it's not a happy wheels video
me too Kernel
Derpy_Hooves Never heard of him, I'm more of a Robbaz fan :P
I like FiM songs because they have some purpose in the story
i want to see him play the new character
I loved chuggaconroy when he did Earthbound
I got sick of Chugga when he started yelling everything.
herp der this is the wrong pony duuuhhhh i want real pony. dis dumb
CrimsonPhoenix: Agreed.
Hat: and because they have good singing?
CrimsonPhoenix: ONe of his best LP's, IMO.
hey, aleast it's not the biggest teaparty ever live show
AJIsAwesome, and his first
CrimsonPhoenix: Yep.
chugga is pretty annoying
Bluemario2: that shit is hilarious
cowvarkian: the quality too, but in this show it's just filling the quota
its not about the lps its all about the rps :P
biggest teaparty noo

Dear. God. In. Heaven. Rainbow Dash. I feel ill.
cowvarkian: they are all nude
KernelCobb: true
brofooh

dafuq
You go girl!
who wanst to bet that count is going to be over 70 by the end of the movie?
we normally dont wear clothes
I'm not here to notice that you change your name to Val. :D
g3 drinking game: take a shot whenever somepony says "darling"
wants&
Spike is a jerk
Oh look, G3 Vinyl Scratch :p
oh lord
<.<
2,14 Val is my official name...it's on the team list
"I rainbowed a rainbow that was so rainbow..."
Okay.
wtf is this shit?
g3
Its pony
g3
I hear you like rainbows, so we put rainbows on your rainbow to rainbow this rainbow
Culture lesson
DAT TABITHA
Green flowers?
so you notice everyone on steam, and then you give me this
I would like to declare this movie not shit
Fuck off spike!
KernelCobb: declaration declined
Suddenly you are transported to equestria
:S
And this is what you get.
Enjoy.
spike..just shut up
minty?
If you seen Fluttershy, you seen a pink leaf tree
Every time a pony has a baby it starts a new pony generation
...what did i come back to?
Pink apple tree is AJ
Dragons don't touch princesses.
Hat: I believe this
i miss unicorns and pegasi
Hat: wait
so whats after the joke of a show?
this needs a riff trax guys
dat laugh
How did they find this enjoyable for children? I'm pretty sure 80% of kids watching it stopped WAY before this part.
more g3 hopefully Sinestro
Why does it need a riff trax? Its cool.
hope for more g3 too
d3rb: I'd like sinestro in g3
I am getting sick of the word princess
wat
Not darling?
daaaaaaaaahling
Ew. Their laugh....
and.......when is there going to a hint of moral in this story?
This is so unrainbow
those overused words
too...much...dahling...
you. are not. rainbow das
Dahling count: 17
h
G3 Rainbow sucks
Wait the town is consisting of 11 ponies
you are fine with princess, but Darling Dash is okay.
G3 everything sucks
she needs to go dash a rainbow
not fine
g3 is best g
d3rb: >.>
:P
cowvarkian: not as bad as 3.5 its x.x
The way Spike is pushing her around and giving her orders, I see him as a leader more than her.
Dahling count: 18
20 Darlings...
but it was not good enough, so you are out when G4 rolls around.
HiImSpike: true facts
Then burn it. Burn the flower.
/me kidnaps HiImSpike
<.<
DAT KIDNAPPING
Our princess is in another castle
hah
Is he still a baby dragon
:O
this rainbow lacks the I'm better than everybody attitude... bad
OK. Let me get this straight... a pony digs up a lizard with a flower, and the lizard says, "You're a princess now", and EVERYPONY JUST BUYS IT. Without any question. Except for the Princess.
AJIsAwesome: can't burn it...'tis magic
Hat: no, he's just a midget
KernelCobb: *sigh* :(
D:
oh...hey everyone.
Kencolt: IKR? :|
Kencolt: g3-wonderland
Hi QT_Marks

Is Pinkie Pie trying to make an ice cream float with real ice cream?
well, i guess good. what with this show on
This world's government sucks
KernelCobb: this is a government?
Rainbow berry juice?
this show
what are they pegasus faries
There is a flavor called rainbow berry?
cowvarkian: my point exactly
...what the fuck did her nose just do???
I want to punch spike in the face
which mod is trolling us?
DerpyMuffins: Seems legit
IshHamsterJelly: caramel
FUCK THE POLICE
oh
dat troll spike
11,01Chat, what did you do to get G3 on stream?
Oh no
y Caramel, yyyyyy!!!
Ask Caramel
Nittany_Discord: I don't know, wasnt here
Princesses don't say Darling.
19
We didn't do anything
Nittany_Discord: Nothing. Nothing at all. :D
Thats for sure.
dahling bow bahling
2,14 Darling, I just really like it, Darling
g3 spike go back where you came from and bring g4 spike out
Well, a princess is NEXT IN LINE to be the ruling monarchy. The actual ruler is the queen.
Dawling
Caramel: I hear you like dahling so I put dahling with your dahling to make it more dahling
What makes it royal?
Spike has a mother..
dawlception
Yep. Voilently murdered by the humans
Some ass hole named Dovahkin
Brb.
wha?
spike..... whats tha matta
a few generations
dat ping
Spike's only mother was Twilight Sparkle, and she died of natural causes.
I just got here, why is G3 on?
XylemTube: because caramel
XylemTube, because its awesome
and this was the precursor to spike wanting to bang rarity in the gen 4
Every time he wakes up he has to meet new ponies
XylemTube: cuz it can be
11,01Kandarihu: Tell that to Celestia, Luna, and Cadence.
because of me
XylemTube: because it is:D
trolling
because of trolls
lol
Kandarihu: die?
Spike just trolling
SPIIIKE
princess of ponyville?
11,01But Ponyville is a democracy.
11,01:p
rape him
cowvarkian: yeah
He never met Luna, has he?\
I'll give G3 props, Spike isin't as dumb as he is in G4
cowvarkian: yes, canterlot was destroyed long ago
HiImSpike: I don't even
it's been a thousand years, anyway
without a princess
she can't be princess, she doesn't have a horn and wings
wtf happened...
Spike, forever a pony
wat
Dat 4th wall
oh god, if they reuse this story in G4
share that secret, between the 2 of you
Oh God its G3!
someones happy
Kandarihu: implying she has no progeny?
>Open stream
>G3 ponies
Sinestro: that would be interesting, becuase thaen it would actually be good.
What did we walk into?
DashWithRainbows- inorite?
twilight livespan
VAAAAAALLLL
did they just say Trololol?
No. Really. Die in a fire! I insist!
Kandarihu: there needs to be a fanfic from spike's point of view on how G4 ponyville evolved into this movie's ponyville
never learn'd
How mutch longer is this movie?
yeah lol i think so
XylemTube: Tralala...
Oh. Okay. If Cadence has progeny, she/he will not be a winged pegasus.
this is a movie? ? ? :(
spitfirecolt: No.
Kandarihu: so, how did cadence come to exist?
spitfirecolt: They never said that in the show.
yup
nothing is happening
Every time Spike goes to sleep he regenerates into a new form and a different Ponyville from a thousand years
11,01Darling.
cowvarkian, genetic mutation.
22
A straight to DVD movie at that
its been argued Celest/Luna are the only immortials. others are just lesser alicorns
celestia is 3000 yrs old
the darling has been doubled
Nittany_Discord: dahling*
those pixie thingies are actually kinda cute. if only their colors werent so evilly pastel
bow before me, peasants!
There is a little wire, in my brain, that shorts when that pony says darling. Just her. It is telling me to murder things.
Kandarihu: I'm pretty sure that that genetic mutation would also be a dominant one, ensuing in all of her female children to therefore be alicorns
KernelCobb, I thought of that, but it would make it too similar to another story I'm cooking up that is not pony related and that I want to realize as more than just text.
that lip-sync
spitfirecolt: hmmm I always thought she was only 1000 fo some reason
spitfirecolt: My theory is that Celestia and Luna are special, even by alicorn standards, and Cadance is much more of a normal pony, even though alicorns are still extreamly rare.
23
2,14 so yes....G4 will be after this...hehehehe....hehehee
11,01We need one male alicorn in the show.
They have cars in Equestria?
Red and black with stripes
its canon, first princess
i've got a really bad feeling about this
yes for more alicorns in G4 ;)
Nittany_Discord: Agreed, and not an evil one too.
Guys... I think Caramel has finally snaped.
Nittany_Discord: I don't want male alicorns, it destroys my hypothesis
I blame you all for this
Caramel: ...whyyyyyy does that laughing make me dread the near future?
Nittany_Discord: nope Instead we get prince Blueblood
Rex_Mundi: according to a bioligy major, allicorns are more common than the show implies. genetics and such...
DerpyMuffins yes, well, no, well we have seen one, one that also makes cider
PRINCESS PINKIE PIE?!
still lost, if shes princess, wheres Queen, King? even if she was a newly crowned Princess with no Queen she would automaticly be the new Queen
IT PARTY TIME
WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS
cowvarkian, it's more like the kind of genetic mutation that allows two-headed turtles to exist. It's a one-in-a-million genetic quirk.
PARTY ALL THE TIME
fucking girl logic hating on the Queen title
DAHLING
AGAIN, WHAT FUCKERY IS THIS
wait...
Princess Utter Tyranny... actually, not everyone gets to be one
Caramel why not a nice relaxing game or murder robots instead? I mean Mann Vs Machine.
If Pinkie is a Princess, this world is fucked up
of*
Errybody a princess
So many princess
2,14 Spike is a Princess <3
If everypony is a pincess, isn't their no ruler?
brb
well the show needs a history episode
wow
oh shut up spike
And the only reason it happened twice in a generation with Celestia and Luna is because Discord ruled the world at the time.
KernelCobb: I think Alicorns are more special than simple genetics.
11,01Princess Spike!
spike is high king
NO, NO MORE SONGS
ANOTHER obligatory song? :|
Nothing evil happened after
the thing that people call, " the bottom of the barrel"
This song blows
dat blanket
it was bearable UNTIL FUCKING NOW!!!
O.o
Sunnydays, that's not quite a bad name.
what did i come back to?
we will find out in season 3
when every one is a princess no one is
G3 neads Tirak to show up and wrek shit up G1 style.
i wish them a horrible death, all of them
this song just wants to make me vomit
2,14 ~For tomorrow Spring is here~
Caramel: No. :(
Rex_Mundi: there was a 4th alicorn appearance, but it was during a hallucination. probably just a animation error, but still.
11,01Everyone in chat is a princess now.
muted until over
S3 needs more princess
it burns
/me is now a princess? :(
YAY i'm a princess
So no one is a princess!
but I'm a man!
becuase everyone is!
Rex_Mundi: Celestia might be having them all destroyed
Hoorah
Aw yeah

That's not really proper gvernmental procedure.

Aren't I such a pretty princess

That song. Take a dump on your hand, smear it around a bit on your wall, and you get the aesthetic equivalent of it.
11,01Dester: Yep.
IT'S OVER \o/
We need to recalibrate
G2 cough
FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU
to REAL ponies
Total darling count anyone?
1/10
10/1
.1/10
yes to the real ones!
what a great movie!
lol
-10/10
One s for me... hang on
Rex_Mundi: biologicaly, the chance for an alicorn is like 1/64..
That is NOT RD/10
fact: spcae does not exist
And thus the vaule of being a princess has been inflated worse than college majors
space
<.<
10/10
THERE
Darling/10
2,14 you guys need to have more faith in me :P
spaaaaaaaace
Princess_ValtheJean: fuck faith

Oh hey Rei, I encountered that love triangle fic you got stuck editing.
I like Duck
...
How?
:<
Dude wanted help with grammar.
I like hats :P
Well thank God he found someone else to do it.
Which is the least of the problems concerning that literary abomination.
Good to know I was completely and totally justified.
Some way, somehow, FIVE OTHER PREREADERS managed to miss those tense shifts.
I mean, how? How does an atrocity like that happen?
00,10refresh
these multi-cellular lifeform have done some intersting things
i´m out.. bye
bye brony90
Bye brony90
Given the exact caliber of writing we're talking about here I don't put much stock in the folks this guy hangs around with often enough to trust them to read his fanfics.
G'night everypony! :)
11,01Stream's up. Cut the video links out.
...D'awwwww
Goodnight GilDash
k
OMFG ADORABLE
aww
So yeah, now you know.
Night GilDash
So much adorableness!~
I mean the grammar is atrocious but the story itself is just terribly bad.
Ah, Digimon!
0,14Digimon? YEEEEEEEEEEES
what are you guys talking abou-oh ok
haha
so cute video :3
You know the phrase "lavender mare" appeared 7 times in chapter 1?
Digimon again?
Please don't remind me please don't remind me
daaaaaw.
well, this showed never appealed to me, so i'm off to play some DC Universe online
What G is it?
We're back to Mips
goodbye bronies!
DerpyMuffins, this is G1
I mean good grief, is the guy familiar with the concept of a Thesaurus?
Somehow I ended up the go-to guy for helping him.
ah memories lol the jp op is better :D
I was going to leave, but then i realized digimon
With plot, anyway.
I get the feeling he has gotten zero criticism except from EQD, who basically said "this is unreadable we're not going to bother the main prereaders"
There's no pacing, no setup, the thinnest of connections, it's just...urgh.
Good bye KernelCobb
I trust you gave him the news in your usual tactful fashion.
but yeah, I'll be back later
Oh hey look it's that other show I never got to watch as a child!
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Jet Blue Recieves Jet Blue Pony!
I told him that sorting the grammar out was something to do after everything else is fixed.
Well that's one way to look at it.
The way I saw it was basically "fix his grammar, let the EQD prereaders tear him apart"
I don't think I can focus on video games and anime at the same time
Mozdoc: Magic.
00,10magnets
Lies.
holy crao
Nittany_Discord, enjoy your Bastion
He's a supah haxor
digimon!
0,14yep
dari has nothing better to do than refresh EQD constantly. All day.
Combination of the above.
theyre like monsters, but digital!
It's true.
xD
;______________________________________________;
/me has arrived at bronystate
I'm back, and-Digimon?!
hi DoctoDoctorWho
00,10dari is a time lord
Dari sacrifices himself for us :)
11,01I should stream Bastion.
00,10he recorded all the eqd post up till the end of days
13my little syndication, RSS is magic
They have a sun in Digimon world?
EQD is going to be around until the end of days? *shudders*
Nittany_Discord, that would be awesome
0,14man, mods are popping up everywhere
I know even less about Digimon than Pokemon...
13EQD will cause the end of days
EQD probably /is/ the end of days...
Nittany_Discord, yes yes yes!~
Pfft. Herdmind.
/me smells the horrific stench of a sheer pokemon ripoff
Train?
SaxyPretender Might want to get the Mod repels.
0,14>Digimon
0,14>pokemon ripoff
is it wrong that i think that matt has a nice ass?
0,14....
Digimon and Pokemon are so alike
I was under the impression they were two distinct series.
lies
0,14Digimon came out FIRST.
and BS
Maybe Lyra` , maybe. :D
Obvious trap is obvious
Are you really that surprised SaxyPretender?
SaxyPretender, it's different enough. There's no collecting of Digimon
DoctoDoctorWho: That had an actual plot and got darker in its later seasons than Pokemon
SaxyPretender knows the score!
Are you really?
0,14...I shouldn't be, but I am.
Digimon got the anime and Pokemon got the games
SaxyPretender: what year did it debue?
0,14like...'96?
0,14To wikipedia!
i believe digimon was 95-96
*manner
The fact that folks with that level of writing ability decide that it's worth showing the internet baffles me.
00,10Digimon also has games
SaxyPretender: pokemon debued first in 96
00,10they just were on the wonder swan
I'm getting a lot of buffering.
00,10a hand held that never got US marketing
The other advice I gave was "go read something that isn't crap"
It's so weird to see the monsters talk...
The Digimon virtual pet things were in the US before Pokemon
i beleve were watching digimon right now *afraid to click the unpause button*
To be fair, though (on the grammatical end at least) I'm pretty sure English isn't his first language.
No excuse on the plot level, though.
SaxyPretender: so the issue still stands as to which series came out first in that year
00,10you are on the wrong embed any ways flutterchu
digimon
0,14yeah, those wondersawn games explain Ryo's presence in Adventure 02 and Tamers
Lyra`: you mean that Digimon don't learn through fighting?
00,10yep SaxyPretender
Sumica: pika pi?
It's not. Which frankly ownly confuses me further.
adventure 02 was AWESOME!
Apparently in later chapters he turns it into a comedy, or something. I don't know, I couldn't get past the first chapter.
0,14^
they learn without fighting
...
Meanwhile.
You made a grammar mistake.
0,14I actually plan on naming my first born son Davis
I'm tired, give me a break.
Tamers was sweet
This is testamony to the sheer badness of this.
SaxyPretender: so did u find which came first?
If it can give you a grammatical error, then it has hit a legendary level of bad.
0,14eh, got too lazy
0,14Digimon to watch :3
But entertainment is fuuuun~
Gabumon's pelt = Edd's Hat
0,14...dat smooth jazz
Cypresswolf: dat logic
I MUST TAKE ON THIS QUEST MYSELF THEN
SaxyPretender: I thought your first three children were going to be named Oppan, Gangnam and Style?
is somnthing streaming
besides my logic is thesis worthy :3
0,14Nope.
I managed to read chapter 2.
HOORAY
0,14I liked Gangnam Style, but not that much =P
But by the end of it I was getting a headache.
flutterchu: Refesh if you're on LimeV we're on Mips again
00,10good guy matt
lol
0,14ah, Matt and T.K., I'll hate your guts come next season ^_^
Well, you have a stronger tolerance for BS than I do.
but for now theyre cute :3
oof, look at that blush <3
This kid needs a lesson in manners :|
00,10ok I can see hateing TK but why matt?
jealouse of his nice ass
obv
People publish things to get attention. In all fandoms - and especially this one - English is generally the language of choice.
0,14...Shipping reasons and that's all I'll say.
Am I seriously the only one who's getting lag?
00,10ahhhh
It's stupid but there's logic behind it.
oooof
Lyra`: that's why Pokemon works better as a game rather than an anime :D
0,14For Digimon, I am a UPS worker.
i read sooo many ship fics for digimon <3
didn't sora end up dumping tai so she could jump matt's bones or something?
00,10you wanted tai to get the girl
0,14...Yes, Sumica.
True, but he can't be blind to how lacking his story is. Why draw attention to /that/ of all things.
pokemon first airing date April 1, 1997 | digimon first airing date March 7, 1999 | pokemon came first TAKE THAT BITCH
AND THEN
AHAHA
sorry i eman
hot damn you're stupid
TAKE THAT
Right when that red surface reacted to the fire, buffer
uh oh
anime wasn't the first incarnation
March is before April...
lol
Meanwhile: check the year
GIANT WATER DRAGON
He isn't.
Wait
0,14dat Seadramon
oh hey
I mean
he is.
Seadramon
we have digimon and nobody tells me? what the HELL people??
http://i.imgur.com/Jze21.gif
He is quite literally blind to how bad the story is.
I want to find my old digimon games now...I know I still have 3 for ps1 - I hated that loading screen
Okay. I just refreshed on the first eyecatch and didn't find myself moving too much ahead. We're all lagged like this, we gotta be
00,10anime did not come first flutterchu
so flutterchu, you realize that the animes came out later than the actual thing right?
Well that's even more discouraging.
how embarrasing
Hat: aww, did I miss that? :D
I've been trying to say it nicely for days now.
Seadramon evolved from Horseamon
Buytoast: T_T
lol
MadSurge, it was very traumatising be glad you weren't there
However, with each time I get locked into a PM convo with him, I despair more and more that it will be possible.
You're in despair.
This fanfic has put me in despair.
Power lines.....
In water....
Hat: BUT I LOVE G3/LIVE SHOW TROLLING ;__;
0,14Seadramon giving no fucks
YOU'RE JUST PISSING IT OFF
There is a distinction between Pokemon and Digimon. Pokemon are the wildlife of the world in which they inhabit. Digimon are the intelligent population of their world.
Derpy_Hooves: seeing the extreme state of disrepeair these powerlines are in, on would guess they werent always in the water
he's a virgin he gives so few fucks
what the two pikachuz i mean what the- that's not pikachu the whooiiin on ze left iz pikatchu
NOW HE FUCKED UP
oppan gangnam style!
00,10onichan
Oniii-Chan = oniiii-chan - wonderful translation
Sumica: exactly :D
Derpy_Hooves: whoops. wrong ping
im in my barracks room singing the crap out of that song, and my sgt starts banging on the door XD
NOW HE FUCKED UP
How many Derpys are there?
onii-chan!
Not enough
Cypresswolf, no point translating a word that the vast majority of anime fans know.
And then he died. The end
0,14Yaaaaaaay
0,14>.>
JUST BECOME A GIANT MONSTER
fuck shit up mode engaged
0,14Also, AWWWWWWW YEAH GIANT WOLF
...Ouot of curiosity, was this anime one of the many that got fucked over by the dub?
Gururumon <3
Because that would explain so much.
He upgraded his firmware
Reikim: yep
0,14iirc, dub took out a lot of the music
00,10not a fuck as some but yeah it suffed from locolsasion Reikim
Reikim: heard the english dub once. never. again
SaxyPretender: And it gets better when it turns into the GIANT WEREWOLF or the GINAT METALWOLF
Reikim, a general rule is that if the dub is meant for broadcast TV, it WILL get messed up
mythrill?
OH FUCK THERE REALLY IS A STREAM
0,14though I haven't really seen the originals
And second: was it a 4kids dub?
0,14also, dammit dinner ;_______;
Reikim: It was a Saban dub
So "evolutions" are really power levels, unlike Pokemon where they are more like growing stages
good night everybrony! :)
00,10no this was a Saban dub
Bye MaxTheBrony
i grew up with the german dubs. luckily, they were very close to the japanese original
So basically, I'm pretty sure that next time he bugs me I'm just going to be forced to tell him the truth, sans softening.
the worst sing is what they did witht he soundtracks
Am I getting it right?
SaxyPretender|Dinner, tell me the story of your people
*thing
Reikim, I don't think it was 4Kids. But it doesn't matter if it was 4Kids or not. It was made for broadcast TV. So I naturally watched it trying to guess what got messed up.
"You cannot write fiction"
The digivolution music absolutely rocking, I never guessed that
group walks in and laughs from off screen
More or less.
Dark_Horst: I would have just turned off the soundtrack :D
tentacle rape?
"In fact, it's a wonder you can write your own name"
Seaponies
Actually, if I wanted to be really blunt...yeah, that would work.
lol
*head desk* &&&
same thing?
"Just...go live in a cave and never attempt to communicate anything through the written word"
That monster looks ridiculous!
so, will we take that up as a regular series in here now? please tell me we do
Argh :| whatever number button has that darn up arrow looking thing
The OP/ED music rocking, I pretty much consider to be the norm. As is the use of silence when appropriate
...so everytime we want him to evolve... we have to get Yamato into trouble!
"You have zero talent with the English language. Please stop now before I am forced to trepan myself out of self-defense."
not too hard
didnt you notice th random harmonica
Dark_Horst: Sumi ran the first two eps last night so hopefully yeah
*the
And then they all died. The end
sounds like a lute
Hat: naw, they learn how t proper cntrol that stuff later
*flut
*flute
DIGIMON!
Which episode # is this one?
Eddmario: 3
This music is too loud
WOAH
Oh, it's the Japanese version...

Yay, skipping over the sappy ending song! :D
Oh, don't skip over the ending song

hi

So when did Applejack become human?
Perhaps you could recommend something to read that he might take something from the writing style.
yesterday
:3
Que?
Or at least demoralise him into stopping entirely.
And started wearing pink hats? :D
MadSurge, that's not Applejack.
I can beat Meramon easily
Mimi is the best character
somepony_else: sorry, keep pinging the wrong people tonight

you should now feel a nervous energy in your chest, right around your sturnum
flutterchu: yes we do
FEEL MY POWER!
flutterchu: Yeah but we're doing the JPN one cause that's how we roll
Gotta love those automatic reboots.
THEN WHY THE JAPANESE
becaus 4kids
A giant care bear

00,10flutterchu you do know this is dual audio
oh pokemon clone
um it was fox kids at the time
Hey Sumica what was the name of that over the top Anime where they strap a giant spinning Jet to the earth and use the planent as a weapon to fight giant robots?
Fun fun fun.
Thrackerzod: *ripoff
00,10see english
The_Browncoat, shush :3
XylemTube: Either Gunbuster or Diebuster, pick your choice.

Worse, it was for...an IE9 security update.
i hate it with passion

Back. What did I miss?
Oh, RIGHT when I came back from the bathroom!
there is no Zalgo, only Zuul
diegehmonoh
No there boreing poitless and the bigest pokemon ripoff ive ever seen
I dont think I ever saw any of the Digimon movies
XylemTube: Actually, yeah, that was definitely Diebuster. Watch Gunbuster first, though; I know Sumi streams it sometimes.
Also I have no idea why they're in a jungle. Did they fall in the internet or something like that?
Cypresswolf: I don't think you're really missing anything.
Dat sudden change
It looked like a big ????
the first digimon movie was really good Cypresswolf
Next stop on our tour, the forest of irrelevant road signs, no pictures please
What just happend?
i might enter that into the lottery next time :3
00,10we just finished Gunbuster last night
...
And I wasn't here.
It was amazing.
DAMN IT
whats gunbuster
patamon is best pikachu ripoff tho
is it good?
suddenly english and japenesse voices
Lyra`: :O
Oh well, I've got it on hard drive now, time to go deal with that~
>_>
serious question is serious!
Lyra`: It's great, if you can get by some weird fanservice.
Why are they running through the forest
Lyra`: It's just plain awesome. Corny, in places, but loveably awesome.
fanservice :3
Lyra`: The ending is FANTASTIC.
IT'S GAINAX! FANSERVICE ADDS TO OUR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!
Lyra`: did i lag over something again? what ahppened?
AJIsAwesome: Welcome Home. ;_____;
dont stop pata pata
Reikim: IKR? :'(
:)
Gunbuster was the first anime to give me manly tears.
HOW CONVENIENT
it points weast
MAGNETS!
File Island is on the Grand Line, apparently
:D
Kandarihu: File island?
SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERNEEEEEEET
00,10yeah it's called "file island"
Okay
AJIsAwesome, oh right. They're no longer there.
Where are these kids' parent anyway?!
just keep walking
00,10it's still the introduce all the evolusions arc so it's still file island
MadSurge: They got sucked out of the real world and into the digital world
00,10they are just now hinting at the big bad
:|
Und dann they all dehydrated. The end.
00,10the black gear thing
hey
MadSurge, they were at summer camp when they got pulled into the Digital World. They were temporarily separated from their parents.
MadSurge: ...although their parents do get involved later in the series when they go back to the real world
Overly attached digimon.
lol
oh, he evil
at least now
HELLO BRONYSTATE,
hi
...Hm. Got this massive .mkv file labelled as Gunbuster. VLC Media Player displays a green screen, but I've got sound. Am I doing something wrong?
Hello ASoftFluffyThing
JESmith71: ah, the nineties, when parents didn't want to even touch their kids' games :D
..............illusion........
Watching the English dub, I REALLY liked it when Tai returned to the real world for one episode.
/me hugs Cypresswolf
...they look edible
nvm
lol dark
^_^ It's SO FLUFFY
Failing that, is there another media player that will play .mkv?
ohai ASoftFluffyThing
Reikim have you got the codecs
now i know how bad of a dub twas in english
told you
yo
<_<>_>
I've never had a problem with mkv before.
Reikim, MPC is pretty much the best there is for it.
VLC will handle MKV. But it's VLC
nope
delicious water. sounds neat
why dont we have that?
lava
00,10MPC is better imo
These mons are wielding the power of friendship all wrong! YOU MUST DO RAINBOWS WITH IT
I've got that
not so delicious anymore
drink some lava
it came out of my left speaker for a moment (it scared me)
00,10it handles mkv 10bit like a champ
Just a blank green screen.
hello evrypony
It confuses me.
hi
Reikim, did you install MPC straight? Or did you install CCCP?
Hi, Slender_Pony
Hello Slender_Pony
I've got VLC Media PLayer.
*Player
00,10yeah you probably need CCCP
but dont take the note (you can tell by my name)
CCCP?
wut is that/
badass
00,10comunity core codic pac
Combined Community Codec Pack
00,10somthing like that
Nice zoom on that thing.
its pony time
USE SAND ON IT :D
i love gravaty falls
Whelp, better go look that up then
Reikim, hang on
I don't know what that is so I should be fine.
avgn: BURN motherfucker BURN
Am I old fashioned using VLC for everything
Sooound
00,10I think it's part of CCCp
hi
00,10not at all Hat
burn baby burn
00,10it gets the job done
Why can'r rhese monsters shut uuuuup -__-
00,10MPC just has more functions
I want use the best software
:|
I'm hoping MPC solves it, because otherwise I just downloaded 6 GB of anime for nothing :I
:) The song Fireman by George Straight came to mind when they introduced Meramon :D
MadSurge: would you shut up if you were on fire? that shit has to hurt man
Dark_Horst: that looks natural to him though
Run you little squid plants.
Well, no ship sherlock. You're a fire degimon
fuck
hey, dont think I saw you here before, are you new?
o fuck
Who came up with the names?
Fire the cannons - Oh wait
Just leave the chicken there, you'll have a nice digidinner
Inb4 owned
Chickens cant fly
lol madsurge
er.
bird monster, attack is fire. wut.
Fight fire with fire, smart
yeah fire works great -_-
something tells me fire wont do much here
they totally thought this through
Its not very effective
00,10gas for the fire
SUDDENLY Allegr0 :O
Well in the dub they changed it to Spiral Twister which turns into a wind attack
digimon always seemed silly to me. that the monsters could just evolve at will. sort of takes away the illusion that the writers wern't just totally making it up as they went along
AJIsAwesome ;)
Hey Allegr0
yes, more fire and air
Hey Allegr0
DerpyMuffins: only because you never saw one flying
that will do it
ohai Allegr0
hey all
:D
Allegr0: hi
USE WATER AND SAND
>Being attacked by a fire monster
>Try setting it alight
Use sand attacl
oh boy
cue guitar riff!
here we go
ZING!
I wonder why they say the names of their attacks
Awesome music here
Hyped!
AWWWWW YEEAAAAAAA
attack Meramon with fire attacks - brilliant
uglyphoenixmon!
dam that thing is ugly
Hat: japan. they always do that. everywhere
:D
He's getting biger becasuse he's a fire thing
00,10it's just a bird.
Noooo, I don't want these kids to succeed! D:
DIGIVOLUTION
birdamon? not even a clever fire pun?
00,10a large bird mind you.

What an upgrade!
That's quite a big evoloution stage...
anti-fire!
WHAT
Well that escalated Quickly
My chili is so spicy im litterally tearing up :'(
why did that hurt him now?
MORE FIRE KILLS IT?!
WHY
So whenever the group is in danger one of them evolves and saves the day
Too hot for ya? *ba dum tish*
so the gears are basically rip-offs of the shikon jewels in inuyasha right?
so they were right all along!!
you would think this would be a logical time for the seal monster thing to evolve, but nope, we get a giant bird
Fire = destruction, I guess
Clearly the problem was that there WASN'T ENOUGH FIRE!
Hat: for now. they're still learning about that stuff
Hat: I start to see a pattern :D
how does something so cute become that big bird?
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9>_><_<
Its made of fire, wouldn't it just absorb more fire?
00,10dont emote spam
Now that's beating fire with fire

Who would've thought something so cute could have a little fire monster inside.
Mugwies
Why "japanese growling stomach" means "fart sound" in western
6Yeah i'm new :D
Mozdoc, it's in the nature of the Digimon.
lol
maybe japanese are a weird strain of vulcans
:P
THE END
Seeds! for everybody
Yeah, bird food!
godzirra!!
their organs are all somewhere else
the japanese are vulcans? that makes much to much sense
it godzil
supress emotions at all times, in love with science and technology and logic
Oshit. Am I missing the podcast?
throw the seeds on the fire - Instant popcorn :)
O.O
XAX: Hasn't started yet
and animes are the vent
xax, we always start at 89 est :P
So, do any of these monster pugs evolve into something that doesn't match their previous form?
TheMaster: I don't see the relevance of tentacles to Vulcans though.
9*
TheMaster, I don't see the Japanese suppressing or controlling their emotions all the time.
Evolve into a delicious meal somebody
Ohai Allegr0
Allegr0: Is that at the end of this hour? Iunno my timezones.
hey guys
hey Ponies47
The Japanese are super repressed. Their ideal version of feminity is being quiet and doing whatever someone tells you
MadSurge: now, that would be telling, wouldnt it?
Hey Allegr0, wanna diss Digimon too? :D
wishwishwishwish
I loved digimon when I was younger MadSurge :P
and clearly tentacles are japan's pon far
lol anyone remember Fighting Foodons? :D

TheMaster, the only reason tentacles exist is because there's a law against the drawing of male genetalia.
yes, and so japan improvised

If we decided to change films from choosing an A film and a B film, to choosing a film with >7.5 rating and <7.5 rating, what would you think?
:D Hoof Bump
0,14Ehhhh
XAX, he has octorocks
Hoof bump!
GabeMoistmon: Oh boy!
There aren't enough bandits to kill in Skyrim
The idea has merits.
poorly rated movies arn't always bad. critics are not always known for their taste
Would we still call it A and B dari? Because that looks a little wordy.
yeah! :)
i liked the a/b method
Yes, the >7.5 would be A, and the <7.5 would be B
after all. Kung Pow is a A+ movie, and they gave it a 'bad' rating
Dark_Horst: Lotteries are long because not everyone agrees on what is A and B
Is that going by IMDB?
sunshine sunshine *punch punch*
The song is oodly fitting
0,14I'd be against it
GabeMoistmonL That'd be A
Why not B?
BOOKS
7.5 on Rotten Tomatoes, I'm guessing?
Why not Zoidberg.
love this vid
i'd rather stick with the old system too
books!!!
rotten tomatoes suck..
GOD I LOVE BOOKS
Books are sexy
00,10I would rathr go by IMDB
Dem sexy books
00,10if we even do that
If you see a pink thing moving in the Skyrim wilderness, RUN
Well it'd definitely cut time down and it's worth seeing how it goes.
are you around Adjeca?
how can we read if she owns all of them?
For some reason I had that grand chorus pop into my head at school last week.
wouldn't that mean that twilight (the movie) would be classified as an A because of the rating even though its clearly a B movie in quality?
I'm in favour as to the streamlining of the lottery system. However, as I have just shown, you'd get flak from anyone who doesn't agree with the ratings system you're using.
FUCK YEAH BOOKS
Dat Book
next is socks I bet
2,14 TheMaster...the current system would already have it as A...
But then, you already get flak for that, so go ahead.
2,14 it's a high budget film. It sucks ass, but it's not B
00,10this is difrent from now how Reikim?
PRINCE ALIIIII
See above, Sumi; I just noted that.
I think I want to read now. Don't know why...
Aladin Ponies?
:D
Well, what's the chance that an A Movie might get WMC'd?
:D
Pinkie is so Ginie
/me Rings a bell
Pinkie is best Robin Williams
lol
actually I take that back. twilight would be the B in that system
since it got a 5.3
I love this movie~
I enjoy seeing the B movies like Troll 2, movies that are rated bad can just be bad movies. B movies you can at least laugh at
2,14 the chance is proportional to how close the movie is to Babes in Toyland -_-
Fuck that movie.
Picture this movie night: A is Twilight and B is Babes in Toyland
and the big lebowski would be an A in that case
That movie was awful!
Princess_ValtheJean, or Epic Movie?
Epic Movie wasn't so bad
hm. maybe the 7.5 cut off system wouldn't be terrible in that case
2,14 I voted no on the WMC for that
2,14 it's not WMC material, at all
it moves cult classics often to the front, because critics tend to love artsy films
hello
Hello CCCP
Hi CCCP
I know, but the chat reactions were beautiful
TheMaster: true
Hai CCCP
It's the community codec pack!
oh dear
It shouldn't be WMCed for the same reason Spider's Web isn't WMC
D-Wars still has yet to get WMC, so really, who cares?
hai CCCP
I should've been there
Office space is 7.9 in imdb but twilight is 5.3
i approve of the change now
dari you're the only one who liked that movie.
I didn't realize how appropriate and well fitting this song is to Ponies...
Babes got WMC because it was so horribly boring, no one enjoyed it at all
hi CrimsonPhoenix thelonepony DerpyMuffins twilight_sprinkle and Hat
With films that are just REALLY bad, we all at least get a kick out of hating on it together.
Yeah but I've been picking NeverEnding Story as A and its 7.4
ummm hello CCCP
I dont think there's anything that cant be ponified
00,10yeah it was hard to even riff babes
2,14 people are mistaking "bad" movies with "no on is enjoying this"
lol
RARIQUEST
2,14 you can enjoy a bad movie
what's up?
RARIQUEST!
hello CrimsonPhoenix :3 why the ummm?
AP-wait what?
:D
you couldn't mst3k it?
2,14 no one enjoyed Babes
RarityQuest?
hi MadSurge
how is such a thing possible? no movie can't be riffed
Hey CCCP!
CCCP it was just.....nevermind
Princess_ValtheJean ANy other films suffer they clause?
CrimsonPhoenix now i must know!
Has anyone seen Miracle Dogs Too
other than "those" two?
I'm somewhat paranoid about my B Movie choice getting WMC'd.
TheMaster: some movies are so boring that there is just no way to riff them
I missed Babes in Toyland - I think I came here a month later - how bad was it :D
was just curious if you saw any new spyro stuff?
CCCP awkward?
0,14Babes was awful
0,14like
oh okay :D
0,14people dying awful
Cypresswolf: Someone died during the showing.
It shouldn't get WMC unless everyone is incredibly bored.
2,14 we haven't seen anything else yet
Cypresswolf Got the Clause. Never showing it again. You can check the past m ovies list.
So D-Wars should get WMC?
NOM NOM
Non-rifftrax, anyway.
Better question Epic Movie vs Babes in Toyland? which would you rather watch
What does WMC stand for
Guys, I have a good idea for a b movie.
)_)=>
Reikim: i was gonna ask the same thing
Epic.
that'll do pig
Easily.
Hat, worst movie clause
space
Haha, thanks
behold toot spams
Sppaaaaaaacccceeeeeee
spaaaaaaaace
Honestly! D-Wars was complete WMC material. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten that yet.
GET TO DA BUNKER!!!!
Hat: Worst Movie Clause, aka a movie so bad that it shall never be played in Brony State again
00,10D-wars was close
lol
0,14Same
D-Wars was funny as hell.
Whats the most overrated movie ever?
And what happens if the IMDB rating goes down? It goes from A to B
00,10but it had saveing moments
Close?
CCCP, I guess Twilight
Unless someone feels evil and decides on a WMC bore-a-thon....
linsett: I'm aware of that :) I was here for Epic Movie's clause though
No tooting here. This is Rarity Quest
D-Wars had an old woman walk into a fence and fall down.
Worth it just for that.
D-Wars would have been unwatchable without Rifftrax.
as a threat for a ungrateful and evil populace
Kandarihu I doubt that, it gets more hate then love
i'M Back..........Unnr what movies were WMC'ed?
dance liek a phoenix bitch
Hello, i'm back
Cypresswolf Sorry about that...anyways, I have a good idea for a B Movie.
got this earlier http://www.ebay.com/itm/120986425787
wb Dark92Enigma
00,10problem was we had riftrxs version so it saved it
OMG A GIANT ROCK
0,14yeah >.<
lol
-_(\
lol wha?
xD
Henry :(
Yes, but non-Rifftrax D-Wars should still get the WMC.
:(
linsett: I have a B movie in mind I hope gets the clause :)
That'd make Galaxy Quest a B too since its 7.2
Tom....
poor henry
lol
>17 years
T_T
:D
00,10if we did't have riftrax of Dwars it would have gone down in flames
so if something gets below a 7.5 on rotten tomatoes it's an auto B?
he my frind
i don't think rarity was that old
:'( poor Henry
:(
:P I love that darn typos
Henry.....
hi alexxm and AJIsAwesome
How often before has it been required to play the Rifftrax version of a movie because it was that uncompromisingly bad?
Kandarihu :3 it is
Who's streaming right now anyways?
I think IMDB'd be better.
Hi, Dark92Enigma :)
dat House
whats worse, is that Rarity went out with his old school friend, Tom...
Cypresswolf What is it? Mine's A Troll In Central Park.
Buytoast: We haven't taken up the system yet, we're discussing whether or not it would be a good idea
lol
:D
lol
WHAT THE FUCK
I was gauging what you guys thought about it
All those years of life, and he pours his heart out to one pony... he just could not cope.
lol
linsett: Monkey Bone
lolwut :D
:D
JESmith71: Yeah, but it's still epic
How can i find this on youtube
:D:D:D
zecora as foreman? That would be very entertaining to see
:D
Dr. Fluttershy :3
Anyway, I still say go for it. It can't be any more headache-inducing than the current system.
Poor boulder
Dester: Horse M.D.
OH GOD THIS! XD
dash stupid
AJIsAwesome: did you guys stream Nostalgia Critic?
lol
just wondering, cause if that's the case i need to find a new A to start trying to force up
Cypresswolf I'll look it up on Rotten Tomatoes.
Internet is for Porn
lol
Dark92Enigma: Nope.
oh god
Alright. I'm muting this.
Dark92Enigma: Babes in Toyland and Epic Movie, you can find all movies played listed under About Us on the BS website
lol
This song never gets old
wonder what spyro cheats are in it
lol
XylemTube, it's gotten old for me.
CrimsonPhoenix: Yes, if we switched over it would be >7.5 A, <7.5 B
You're a pervert :D
Not that im a clopper but this song is true
it would make things simpler I admit
Unnr: ok, i will
oh god :D
Spike is such a perv
lol
=7.5 is A and a half
ZE INTAHNERT IZ FOHR PWNIES
Thanks for that, Spike.
Some of the most overrated things around me are porn and football.
Good to have concrete confirmation that Spike is a teenager.
FOR PORN!
lol
GabeMoistmon: For God's sake, greater than or equal to 7.5 is A then
I actually managed to give up porn cuz of ponies
:O
DoctoDoctorWho, congratulations.
Kandarihu but nothing is funnier than annoying you co-workers when they spend all day talking about football fixtures, and you start taking about the Canadian Football League season
Kandarihu I feel for you, footballs a religion down where I live.
DoctoDoctorWho so porn is a drug?
Hey look how much info we could have kept to ourselves.

I'll vote in spirit.

Have you seen the newest stuff from Nvidia PrincessGigabit ? MY GOD.
I want so bad
Shizu streamed it.
SQUISHY!!!!! :(
Don't expect Half-Life 3 or Left 4 Dead 3. Valve can't count to 3.
Canadian_Brony: i don't play that game.......i feel a little left out
Squishy?
13what
Half-Life is fun
But it isn't a good game. It's nothing like CoD!
I understand why people like Half-Life.... :c
IM BACK
I'm a Sony
No, I just wanna know who Shquishy is
I used to play Half Life for HOURS.
I'm not....(sadface)
twilight_sprinkle not sure. These are the first blindbags I've seen in stores here. Wave 4 apparantely. Their light-blue and all the ponies are glittery
FUCKING HELL PHOENIX WRIGHT, that was one tough case
Dont you dare mention CoD

Squishy will always be best bug ;_;

Canadian_Brony: does it look like this https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-y2hOkIep1sI/TW7DD8DYOcI/AAAAAAAAAtk/efipoAYwIdY/blind+bag+cherry+spices.png
Dark92Enigma no. Borderlands and Borderlands 2 are for 360, PS3, and Steam. 1 is cheap nowadays, 2 is, well, not

Everypony likes having slaves.
inslavement = war
Unfortunately, that means some of us have to make sacrifices for others.

0,14Oh, Reikim|Crowbar?
I dont think so
Yeah. You're going to main Applejack.
gordan is a great charecter

Because
AltyValts where are yous
She has an attack called "Buster Hoof"
the freeman
Case closed.
so people like half life because the main charecter si called gordan freeman
Reikim|Crowbar, that sounds awesome
0,14but main's Twi
Why so?

Oh, Saxy, have you seen the latest on the gamemode Dominion.
Free? Of kmart? Why?
0,14I have not
AJIsAwesome, lol
I think that is what it is called
As in, why would you need to be free of kmart?
I'll go try and find a link for ya
that is an UNNERVING AS &#$% Rarity plushie....
If only Scoots was here. :D
IKR?
0,14Halo 4 not MLG friendly?
/me feels this should be recorded as a podcast
YAAAAY Twi! :):):)
0,14THANK YOU BASED 343
also, Dredd? B movie all the way
dat twilight <3
0,14kirz, the original Judge Dredd is B =P
yes, and this one was B too
Forrunners?
0,14the Forerunners
YEP
dang forgot the e...
had pretty effects, but B
Halo 4 is Metroid Prime
kirz|partying I'm going to take a wild guess and say you watched it and thought it was . . . meh
/me is almost a Halo fanboy
ohmai
0,14oh, nice to know I wasn't the only one who thought that XD
was very pretty, and they used their slow motion computer effects very well
what scandal?
Allegr0: if you get Halo 4 you WILL play with me. or else.
0,14ah, Bayonetta 2

0,14Allegr0, PrincessGigabit, do it
What happened now?

?*
kirz|partying dressing up a movie with effects doesn't make it a good movie. Battleship is a good example
sagas: You'll see. :D
Maybe hes just having trouble connecting :/
yep, but I think we all knew Dredd and Battleship were going to be B movies before they were even released :)
0,14indeed

Here, let's go ask the PC gamers about that...
Barbetos, but still the 3DS is succesfull

It's the move to Digital.

I want 32 XB of memory. All cache.
People with a lot of songs.

twilight_sprinkle: :D
Allegr0 is now prince blue blood
On snap Gamestop's now sold out of the Basic WiiU package as well!
00,10why so buffer?
Is it just me, or does Twilight look sexier in glasses . . .
It's not just you
>.>
/me noms on Sumica

Damn I just said that
too many formats to keep track of
00,10or is it just me
Reikim:D
DAT TWILIGHT FINISH
did i miss the mane 6 alternate THING?
MEMORY MEANS POWER GUYS
Sumica probably just you
Sumica: just you
Just you Sumica
Probably mips, it doesn't seem to like us Sumica.
will i be able to buy the Wii U with Allegr0 dollars?
oops caps lock
500 gigs of RAM?!?!?
I use my large xbox 360 memory
Don't judge me for my glasses thing!
08,01wow, so i kinda feel amazing and terrible right now
Dat TwiDash
Canadian_Brony: Must be a server
08,01i was talking to my brother on skype
Allegr0 - in all fairness, the 360 and PS3 are trying to bill themselves as full entertainment solutions, not just gaming consoles
Dat TwiDash
so they would need it for music, movies, etc
and?
08,01and he said that someone smashed his laptop by accident
yikes
Oh, well that sucks.
Dat Twilight
00,10they did't put a large HD in the WiiU because it dont need it.
08,01so i went on ebay and plonked £389 on a new laptop for him
that's terrible/
*...
If Noriko got smashed I'd probably be required to pulla suicide.
"hey guys! I'm getting pop=ups on my Wiiu!" "DUDE! HOW CAN YOU DO AN EPIC FAIL THAT BAD!" "Also! We won a free Ipod!! :O" *FacePalm*
Well I wasn't planning on getting one at launch anyway. Wait till the hype and intinal crowds die off first and wait till it has more games
Dat bedhead
00,10the disk size is huge and the read spped is better
08,01i've not told him
no pony answered my question...
08,01it's gonna be one helluva surprise
I didn't get a Wii till a year later when Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros. came out
Three hundred...eighty nine...pounds.
08,01i3, 4gb memory, nvidia graphics
08,01AdamTheDuck: he won't
weeping_pegasi82: what alternate thing?
nevermind
and then there were 6
Is that 4GB RAM? I hope it is.
well then....
dat plot
^
ummm....
08,01Reikim: yup; 500gb hdd
So much plot
0///0
So many plot pics
Damn, man.
08,01it's pretty standard, but he'll be able to play games on it
the wii U.... not even once
08,01which he was missing
:O
00,10dat edited image
He's got a GPU. I am so jelly.
Allegr0, that's called Console war
WiiU will have better graphics than the PS3 and 360
owaw
I wish I loved my brother so much...
Allegr0 - the kind of people that are saying "What's a Mew?"
Kids....
is this a compilation of twilight sparkle picture's
08,01then someone broke it, and he had to use his old, crappy dell laptop
whatever
08,01it's really old and crappy
flutterchu: Yes
stupid teenagers giving me a bad rap
I would buy the wii U if it were good and the oldest console I ever used was the xbox 1
honestly, go buy a kayak or a turbo or a bike....
AJIsAwesome: whatever
flutterchu: :P
PrincessGigabit: do you got a link for that pic with twilight and the fancy flowery thing omn the right? about 5 pics ago
lol flutterchu u mad?
I'm not sure why, but Twilight in glasses is so damn cute.
flutterchu: its best poni compilation
twilight_sprinkle: *sigh* trying not too
I just dont have the rose colored glasses that people with nostalgia have
Also Rarity in glasses is cuter.
The Internet became the Internet?
what's a WiiU exclusive?
:D
I missed it
:O :D
Big fanrage?
And Fluttershy in glasses is moe nirvana.
THEY CAN HAVE IT
The only console I ever got on launch day was the Dreamcast
Platinum
00,10so help me if you start ranting again I am going to launchyou to the mun
PLATINUM GAMES
And I'm pretty sure RD would look good in glasses.
I love when this stuff happens
flutterchu: its ok, you should release your anger
not Paradox
Canadian_Brony: Bayonetta 2
oh
Canadian_Brony: Mario U of course, Nintendo Land
just came back, why were people angry?
I just sit back and watch the shit storm
0,14it's Platinum Games, Allegr0
twilight_sprinkle: i shouldnt get banned dont trick me
Platinum Games' games are all garbage to me anyway
Canadian_Brony: Bayonetta 2.
:(
Bayonetta...a guilty pleasure for me, to be sure.
Dark_Horst Bayonetta 2 will be WiiU exclusive. People flipped shit on Twitter
I am completely against console exclusives though
flutterchu: well okay then, enjoy best poni compilation :)
Ohai Phase4, enjoying your last hours of breaks? :P
and that's stoopid.
dem theats
im just gonna sing my "this is halloween" parody
Canadian_Brony: over THAT?
threats*
eeyup
The other reason I wait is you can't find them barely. When the N64 came out my mom had to go out of state to get one for me
I want all games for as many platforms as possible
internet butthurt
0,14see, I flipped out when Bayonetta 2 was WiiU exclusive, and then I found the details
0,14and then I'm like "Ohhhh. my bad."
what you do is not what comes how bout a real SCARY song,this is nothing like youve seen welcome to town of HALOWEEN
SaxyPretender: ...Why?
So we should be sending death threats to SEGA, right?
00,10sing it to your self
08,01sagas: what's it actually
I was threatened on a Youtube comment saying, and I quote: "If you reply to this comment, I will hunt you down and kill you". I replied "come find me". Still waiting on a reply
08,01whoosp
08,01i meant SaxyPretender
Thanks a lot Nintendo -__-
I AM THE GHOST FADING IN YOUR HOUSE I STALK YOU CAUSE YOURE NOT ALLOWED
Thats just mean
0,14?
people who whine and rage over consoles... fffff
wow thats crazy
They dont give Nintendo enough credit
Nitendo is an asshole for making it an exclusive to their own console though
Allegr0, again
Console war
0,14Sega's been losing faith in Platinum it seems, which would explain the messup with Anarchy Reigns' US release
Boooooo
sounds like an ejaculation
IM THE WITCH FLYING IN THE AIR, TRYING TO SCARE YOU EVERYWHERE
SaxyPretender: I wonder why
some people*rolls eyes*
Cant Nintendo have something nice for once?
0,14cause Sega's got money troubles
KIRBY
I salute Nintendo for taking the gamble on Bayonetta 2, though.
13interesting gaming news

weeping_pegasi82: needy *slaps flutterchu * DONT CALL ME NEEDY. needle from BFDI
D3 was such a disappointment
thinking about that question,i just realized how few games ive played
MY EYES STING!
ok
kirz|boozy: I heard Diablo 3 wasn't that great. Seeing how I never played Diablo before, how bad was it?
kirz|boozy: what's so wrong about D3, can you explain me? :O
AdamTheDuck, it hasn't stopped being a disappointment
so is torchlight a diablo expansion or someth?
RLAH ruined the core of the game, sloppy programming has caused errors since day 1, to start
good night :(
Oh wait, kirz got off

the combinations of abilities the mobs get late-game and how it spikes the difficulty has it where people would rather avoid the mobs than try to kill them

In fact, I think I might go to bed now. Goodnight!
AJIsAwesome: My friend and I were supposed to hang out today so I went and pickd her up. We got back to my place and she kinds started getting nevous after anout 20 minutes because she had a gut feeling because it's the farthest she's been away from her dorm

Hm
/me sits kirz|boozy in a chair "No more nomming"

fairies are hard to catch in bottles
Eh, maybe I'll play GW2.

So I'm playing GW2 and this one NPC is being a sissy. So I took a page from dari's book and said "it's Man The Fuck Up Time :D". He died in the battle, leaving me to fight the baddie alone. -.-;

Dark92Enigma: bye
It's these damn updates
It's cool, by this point my ranger is so powerful that she makes Legolas jealous with a bow and Aragorn would take sword lesson from her, so the boss wasn't all that hard to solo.
2 mispings vs 3 correct pings, the correct pingers win this round!
Really saps my will to play
Also crappy connection
a ranger with the right setup can solo a lot of stuff
why do people have similar compicated names
But it still ticked me off how whiny he was being. He is supposedly a scholar thrust into a leadership position but man, he's no Twilight Sparkle that I can see.
I have a 1.5 mbps line -.-
ghost_flutterchu: to anger you :P
CriticKitten: where you talking about me?
I kinda wanna jab Trehearne in his jugular, but I'm not sure plants have jugulars.
Plants have xylems and phloems :)
plants have a stem!
this is the third time ive been killed
Well this plant is human shaped.
Haarlem...
He's kind of like a salad: bland and tasteless without any dressing, and you feel an obsessive need to chop him into fine bits and eat him like one if he's in front of you for extended periods of time.

Everlasting_Joy: I know that feel. :(
grrr... i really should just get mIRC

or some proper dedicated IRC client, rather than bootletting off trillian like this
Torchlight seems intersting. Might consider getting it.
Is this D3?
I need some games to play anyways.

Silver_Spoon: im not living i just made a silly
Reikim|REDEAD: but it's funny innit
...Not really.
is this that League of Warcraft I've heard so much about?
RAWRity: *facehoof :). That was good.
I hear it's set to be bigger than that World of Minecraft game that south park made fun of
/me noms on RAWRity
RAWRity: :O, I'd play that.
Though I've also read some neat things about Team Portal 3
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Of Course
RAWRity: :D Ha! It's made by Valve, there is no such thing.
Dratted EQS
*EQD
It seems I may be caught in a landslide: http://fav.me/d5fon1j
Silver_Spoon: With no escape from reality?
0,14dat cannon
pretty big cannon
0,14not quite a flamethrower but hey
Everlasting_Joy: I suppose if I opened my eyes...
Silver_Spoon: (Let's do this) Look to the skies, but beware the sun.
How are they even getting your e-mail?
I don't know
Oh hey! Cry of Fear got greenlit! I hereby motion that, whenever it is released, four of us do a complete run through.
Everlasting_Joy: I'm just a rich filly, I need no sympathy
hello everypony how are y'all i just made my new OC sketched her out not to long ago any ideas for a cutie mark
Silver_Spoon: Because you're easy come, easy go. Little high, little low.
Cry of Fear. Man, can't wait to play that one.
DJ_POn-3: pic?
i min.
1 min.
Everlasting_Joy: Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me...
They just keep telling me that they're "investigating" my "account and "if you want to avoid losing your account blah blah blah"
Dken2021: He will not let me go :)(
*:(
looks a bit like VinylScratch with wings not intended
Silver_Spoon: Momma, just killed a man.
I already want to puke every time someone mentions the game, but seriously
Id say put it in the spam folder
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
DJ_POn-3: awesome oc
They dont have your personal information, dont worry about it
Could just be a scam too
And another one gone, and another one goneAnother one bites the dust
Scottish-geeky: thank you kind sir/maam
DJ_POn-3: i be a sir
WE WILL WE WILL ROCK YOU
Scottish-geeky: then thank you kind sir
Silver_Spoon can't let people stone you and spit in your eye
Why they have to bother me like this? ;___;
DJ_POn-3: you are welcome
no idea..
Guys
Everlasting_Joy: Something about guns being put to heads and now they're dead, but their life had just begun?
Just put it in spam
The show must go on
yeah?
i'm gonna add goggles around her neck :)
cause all we hear is
Radio Gaga
DJ_POn-3: maybe fuze a lightning bolt with a note?
/me colapses from song refrence overload
http://darkspyro.net/news/60187/
New spyro news!
This is ourself under pressure
I already deleted them all
Kinixyx: that could work
Silver_Spoon: The desire to not die, and admitting it better to not have been born at all than to do such a henious act.
Well RAWRity She was a Killer
Queen
CrimsonPhoenix: but she didn't start the fire
Gallileo, Gallileo,Gallileo, Gallileo,Gallileo Figaro - magnifico
(yes, I know that's not queen but fuck you)
RAWRity: such nauty word
Hey Cades
Scottish-geeky, so dark and edgy
hey
We thought you lost you >.>
Scottish-geeky: cool is that used from pony creator
CrimsonPhoenix: thanks :)
I need to redo my OC, I hate it's hair
Scottish-geeky, it was meant to be bad
lol you'll never lose me :p
DJ_POn-3: yah i cant draw anemuls to save my life
/me has made waaaaay more OCs than could possibly be healthy
CrimsonPhoenix: bad?
Dken2021: how is it bad?
Silver_Spoon: lol
Is there something wrong with your other Cades name?
as in your OCs are so ridiculously "dark" and "edgy" that it's comical
/me goes to find one...ashaedly
/me *ashamedly
thank you RAWRity
Like, one even has a knife for a CM.
DJ_POn-3 http://i1221.photobucket.com/albums/dd467/DKen2021/My%20Little%20Pony/OC.png made in mlpgenerator, that kind of bad
Scottish-geeky: u can get better art is always upgradable in you're mind
nah, its just my friends are here and its easier to use my phone
even Tracy doesn't have a knife
YOu know the .MOV series did that as a joke, right?
ohh ok
DJ_POn-3: i know
RAWRity: Wait. Are we lamenting general OC design, or a specific case?
instead she has Nicolas Cage as a cutie mark
Reikim|REDEAD: specific
Reikim|REDEAD: a specific case, I presume
they'll probably be gone in about half an hour to an hour
Ah
Dken2021, that's actually a pretty cool one
Which specific case?
CrimsonPhoenix: her name is stabb happy
CrimsonPhoenix: to this day, I'm still proud of making Lord Celestia's CM Kevin Bacon
maybe as you say changing the hair
my friends playing spyro right now :p
Have them join us :)
also, quick question: Why is Val a princess atm?
yea, the color scheme is nice, but don't like the hair the generator gives you
Scottish-geeky, your point?
nah, they dont like it that much
2,14 because the Pony Princess declared everyone a princess
...Whelp, a little scrolling, found the ridiculous OCs.
awww
Scottish-geeky: gaah i am forbidden to enter the site :'(
CrimsonPhoenix: -_(\
Dken2021, yeah.....that does kind of suck
Great
Princess_Cadence: oh. Princess Promenade. Gotha
DJ_POn-3: why
*gotcha
Now I'm Princess of the Redeads
idk
Bleh
am i a pretty princess
who said my name :O?
Meh why not
^
Hora for Princesses
we have moved up in the world from Maid Hour
the princesses are coming, the princesses are coming!!
mmmuuufffiiinnnsss
now, we have Princess Hour
:D
PRINCESSity, I decree
0,14no one kingdom should have all them princesses
I have a question to ask you all. I just made an account and attempted to play TF2. It asked me for an application to start TF2 and I clicked on the option "Steam". The window for it closed, but it has not loaded yet. Was there something I did wrong? :S
Even a princess, I'm still dead sexy.
xD
0,14also, dat music
did alty talk at all while i was gone?
AJIsAwesome: If I recall right, you should just have to restart Steam, then try again.
Am I doing this correctly?
spoo...
Princess_Joy: Okay. Thanks.
-_(\
f
Let us never speak of this again...
I might as well join in on this princess thing. :D
RAWRity: my ocs are supst to be dark
Princess time.
Nor this: i.imgur/wpq6E.png
a little
i is make URL SHADY
http://5z8.info/mercenary_n2j9vf_nic_cage_naked
...Oh great.
oh
Scottish-geeky, it's still horrible design
lemme try that again: http://i.imgur.com/wpq6E.png
^^
PrincessPhoenix: pardon?
Silver_spoon, may I ask what's with all those marks?
First God_the_Atheist decides to exist.
Then argument on OC design.
Silver_spoon it's pretty nice
(although the OCs were, actually, badly designed)
without those blue marks, tatoos, or whatever
PrincessPhoenix: I hit the random button a few too many time, they worked...sorta
I'm keeping this nick
it looks very good
first maids and now princesses, what next?
I like it, Silver_spoon
I question the markings, but who am I to judge?
...
what is this princess hour now\
At least it isn't spoon hour
We are all princesses, whether we choose to show it or not.
Apparently.
'cause that'd be creepy
huh. this game looks like LoL crossed with Diablo 3
RAWRity, well it's Torchlight 2
0,14it's Torchlight 2
PrincessPhoenix: what part of my OCs is horbal as u put it
Scottish-geeky, I'm sorry to say but everything?
Don't forget the grammar...
it doesn't blend in the MLP universe at all
Scottish-geeky: It probably stems from primarily the color choice, extreme contrast like that is bad in design
Silver Dark and red is always bad in design
Silver_Spoon: good i wasint going fo nromal and happy
on ponies anyway
PrincessPhoenix: how about navy blue and green?
You can forgo normal and happy and still do it well.
nerf_soldier, it could work I guess
PrincessPhoenix: i dont see enthing rong with Geeky and Stab Happy
gotta be carefull with the shades
Ocersaturated may be the word we are looking for?
*oversaturated
OIC what I did there
Stab Happy.
...
Moving on now.
RedeadPrincessReikim: Stab Happy is the name of Geekys sister
Yes I realize that
I am now removing myself from this conversation.
Tracy is still better OC
RedeadPrincessReikim: whats rong eith that
In fact, I am leaving chat entirely.
Good night.
And then force me out of chat.
So...yup.
Night regs.
Night RedeadPrincessReikim

0,14later RedeadPrincessReikim
quick: name the last song you listened to all the way through.
goodnight RedeadPrincessReikim
0,14The Wandering Wolf, RAWRity
most likely some brony song.
RAWRity: Boehmian rhapsody
Inner Struggle - Black Electric and MysteriousBronie
oh yeah from greatandpowerfull

/me can't spell tonight
Yeah her remix on flutterwonder

"Farm" by Dinosaur Jr.
never heard of it
nerf_soldier: Like I said earlier, I can't spell tonight -_-(\
Silver_Spoon: sorry
Scottish-geeky, doesn't change the fact that their designs are mediocre
you should look it up. It's fantastic, as are their other albums
nerf_soldier: It's okay, I'm just making fun of myseflf :)
PrincessPhoenix: i did that on peropos
*myself
13still am not boring ponies am i?

0,14and now I learn you can have a pet wolf
^^
yes quite low
Shizuka: I always have something going on in the background, but no, I'm not bored.
it must be nite time fer some ponies
scout19_tf2: so go to bed :D
So Gen had to remake her family on the sims 2 .w.
and I have to say that I'm so used to live commentary on game streams I usualy tab out and do other stuff
nothing against you though

Hello, I am Silver Spoon, and I'm a tabaholic
nerf_soldier: whats that?
http://derpibooru.org/103082?scope=scpee797e8c7c16183d62da95919900ca5c09c6b09e0 talk about this!
hello Silver_Spoon
Hi Silver_Spoon ...
hello Silver_Spoon
hey Silver_Spoon
I currently have 22 tabs...I feel so weak
superretroworld: its from the legend of zelda twilight princess
hi Silver_Spoon
Silver_Spoon: indeed. i usually have around 30
BETTY WHIGHT
hello Silver_Spoon
i got 35 tabs open atm
it was around 40 earlier today
so, apparently Top Draw, the company in charge of animation for the 3rd season has something pertaining to MLP that's 66 minutes long. Thoughts?
MOVIE :[
0,143 part ep?
3 episodes dvd
I would hope for a movie, but I would not be surprised if it was 3 episodes
/me sists in corner siping Arizona ice tea
Back.
or even a three part episode *gasp*
doubtful it would be 3 eps. After all, they have S3 listed as "13x22"
3 part episode sounds likely
Princess_AJIsAwesome: hey
my friend broke spyro :o
perhaps a special then?
Hi superretroworld :)
maybe it will have a continuous story line
xD yeah right
hi
hello DeathStar
taoumi: all my wants, that has them
lali-ho something
hi Scottish-geeky
hi DeathStar
how are you DeathStar
and there I am gone
hi thelonepony

good night everyone
Scottish-geeky: i'm good
scout19_tf2: have faith in the people not working on the show anymore? sure.

scout19_tf2: Meghan McCarthy is the showrunner for S3
wait, so lauren isn't? :(
DeathStar: mez two
Faust hasn't been part of the show since S1 ended
RAWRity: did she work with se 2 also?
lol
celestia be with her
superretroworld: nope
She had consulting producer status, didn't she?
eeeeeyup
she was an executive consultant. Which means she could comment, but had no control over the show.
i fell like blowing up megaton agean
im eating steak u jelly
And theissen may be involved in some capacity for S3, he's not the showrunner this time around.
Mike's sim wants to cheat on me with Gen's sim NOOOO! >M<
0,14huh, didn't know that last nit
off to play some Borderlands
Meghan McCarthy, the writer for the S2 finale and numerous other episodes, is in charge for S3
0,14*bit
This chat needs more dakka: http://derpy.me/A1dxB
:D i thought we wernt saposed to spoil on here
lol
OPINE GUNDUM STYEL
I'm not spoiling anything about the show's content, just mentioning the people involved.
http://derpibooru.org/101303?scope=scpee797e8c7c16183d62da95919900ca5c09c6b09e0
muffin to anyone who got the joke
nothing pertaining to storyline I think is the general area we're not supposed to discuss
gess dats ok i just dnt wanna be banned
People have been pestering M A Larson (another writer) for stuff about Season 3. All he's said so far is "Meghan has plans..."
make of that what you will
makes me wonder though about how the show will be affected by the canstant changing of hands
heh, all I can ever think of now when I hear the word "banned" all I can think of is "YOURE BANNED"
TomDanTheRock is awesome: http://fav.me/d5fmmdo
RAWRity: let us hope for the return of Discord
And he keeps trying to go to work when he's not supposed to for 12 hours
nerf_soldier: not really. Most shows will go through numerous heads of story during their run.
lol
Honestly, I've been laid back about everything in season 3. Whatever they give us, I'm sure I'll be fine with it.
Titanic Team-up of a Terrible Trio?
It's rather rare for a single person to remain in charge of a show for its entire airing.
(Discord, Chrysalis, somepony else?)
Silver_Spoon: DISCORD
i'm more interested in seeing new villains TBH
RAWRity: i'm just worried abiout MLP getting into the wrong hands
got that rite RAWRity
RAWRity: Same
nerf_soldier: if it stays strong for two more years, we will become self-sustaining with fanmade episodes
as long as theres ponies, then im okay
nerf_soldier: seeing as McCarthy wrote the S2 finale, and everybody jizzed over that, I'd say there's not much to worry about.
well im bord
Hi bord!
yea that was an awsome ending to the season
also, that "fanmade episode" stuff is some horse shit.
ha ha
And I'm back?
i like how nopony is payin any attenion to the stream
:D
i'm talking about through the constant changing of hands, we get someone more concerned about making a profit than making a good show
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_96_9>_><_<
scout19_tf2: I am. Just have nothing to say.
Whom ever was talking to me about the cutie mark idea for my OC i drew something like it and see if it works
nerf_soldier: seeing as the show's already making a profit, your fears are rather baseless
i meant to put a might in there somewhere
0,14don't emote spam, Scottish-geeky
RAWRity: ok
Good shows = profit...it's about time a company figured that out
oh look, someome's enjoying the emoticons, again
question: were there more brony newcomers in se 1 or se 2?
SaxyPretender: yes my lord
superretroworld: S2 I think
S2.
/me laments the cancellation of Firefly
Silver_Spoon: It's been 10 years. Fucking deal with it.
superretroworld season 2 from the looks of it
i agree with se 2
Firefly was a decent show, but it doesn't in any way deserve the devotion it gets.
RAWRity: I'm just being melodramatic :P
13which one should i take

So yeah, I became a Brony in my quest to find Octavia. Story of my life :3
Hehe DJ_POn-3 :P
the 10 years later i keep hairing about mlp being poupler
I had beyond nothing else to do and I saw it on netflix so I said "hell, why not?
Hooflix "3
:3
My story i saw Rainbow Dash at school in a art show so i looked it up and was assimilated into the herd :D
so i was like no way in hell this was good so i watched the first epiesoed
Resistance is futile~
and then DoctoDoctorWho made me watch it...
and then the seconed and i was like whoa dude this is awsome but i wasent sold
I did, that I did
I saw KYM's video on it at first. I was initially negative about the show, and I kept switching from negative to neutral about the show. Late March, I gave in and decided to watch the show. Early April, I became a brony.
and so here i am
Assimilation complete, moving to next target
so i stoped watching but i kept thinking about it at school
and then i read my little dashie and by the end i was a brony
Dang it chat derp .-.

Buffer Make Me Sad
I has feelz diabetus
lets just say it explains ALOT
:)
Reboot was an awesome show. Didn't age well, though. :P
So it really is buffering
I don't get reboot.
Don't get it?
Maybe because I'm not internet savvy enough at that time?
Java: script
ie gueeooossshhh tat theeeyyyyaremmiiikiii's gonna be a hug fandom
It wasn't about the internet, though...
Computer?
Yeah
Yeah, I just learn computer recently
Deeper I mean
Gah!
Which episode did we just see?
still better shipping pony then twilight (still better love story than twilight)
It's pretty simple to understand even without the computer savvy.
I loved it when I was a kid
wow intense bro
Maybe I need to rewatch it someday.
I sleep now, Good umm well moring everypony
Good sleep
nyan cat shirt
sleep well Dovah
Having computer savvy just makes all the computer puns easier to catch. :P
WHY DO RANDOM CHATS APPEAR WHEN I PRESS DOWN
And my GOD were there a lot of puns
you want pun?
Night Dovah
You can't handle the pun!
ReBoot is very very punny.
Well, was. But you get what I mean. :P

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL8pvC3mxGo
I finished reading the wiki pages on all the primarchs, their respective space marine legions, and the emperor. not to mention the grey knights and death gaurd chapters. I think even twilight would tell me to stop reading at this point. 0_0

Aww
00,02so
00,02windows
00,02it sucks
00,02it sucks real bad
windows is ok
here is the song of my people: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0
what happen?
00,02d3rb, no
00,02no it is
00,02isnt;'
00,02its bad
i've got linux mint 13 :))
windows 8 sounds REALLY bad but i like 7
00,02thelonepony, some system service is using all my cpu, gdi opperations are inexplicably slow and the entire thing randomly reboots
00,02d3rb, you like bad things
I've heard nothing but bad things about Windows 8 so far.
:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewmqwQWBBMg Hehe, ponified 28 Days Later theme
00,02you would not belive how long it took to get this chat stable
00,02i'm afraid to start anything else
i must have a magic version of windows, mine does everything i want it too
then again you get far more involved than your 'average' user Phase4
You probably don't really do anything too extensive on it d3rb =/
oh i mulittask the hell out of it, but all standard sorta programs
I don't mean multitasking. =/
i know
ok no i didnt
00,02d3rb, thats just it, this is probably the cleanest install of windows this side of australia
00,02if it doesnt match the paterns i see from microsoft or come from someone i know is capable of writing good things, its not running
Initial setup is ALWAYS a pain in the ass. ?_?
00,02seems that it might stay stable this time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UthOcbjKc8
00,02and no, its not my hardware
00,02linux stayed online all day
00,02thats what i was streaming from
.........
Still buffering.....
What are we going to watch next anyway?
I wish I knew how to linux... But I think I'd be completely lost
00,02if i ping timeout windows has died again
one day i'm going to try out linux, see how green the grass is on their side of the fence. next format maybe
I try asking someone to help me understand linux but that guy sneer at me.
douche.
I think I need a true helpful community to learn linux
I mistook linux for dos once and got mugged by the entire chat. o_o
Hey ponies. how are we all?
Ponies enjoying Gravity Falls.
Let me see....
Hub have Ponies.
Disney has Gravity Falls.
I'm listening to Lupin music while I wait for the stream to come back. =)
Nick has Avatar series
sounds like we are having fun
And CN has Adventure Time.
everyone has ace now.
but adventure time is a terrible show
what about regular show
that's awful too
:O
Season 1 and 2 all up is 18hours and 10minutes :D tomorrow at 8am i am getting up and watching 18hours of MLPFiM
whaaaat, regular show is great
i guess if you're 12 years old and are socially awkward than it may be slightly funny
00,02the fuck is portcls.sys
i am neither
because Firey is a spoiled BRAT
internet, can I leave now? Im tired...
I'm indifferent to Adventure Time. Some of it's pretty funny, but most of it is "meh".
yeah, its a bit hit and miss, still worth watching
whelp, Im leaving. ill be back when chat gets interesting

00,02and this its causing my computer to crash
Original pony musics
00,02WITH A SEGFAULT
lawl Phase4
Oh boy
:S
00,02windows nt is a microkernel
00,02its one of the few 'benefits' it has over linux
Java, well obviously I do :3
00,02segfaults shouldnt crash the entire thing
You're Replacer?
although I only reall enjoy that song at the piano kicks in
maybe......maybe its a magic segfault?
Java, whaa, no I just I said yes to enjoying his music
or just winblows trolololol
Scenerio: you have been reincarnated as your OC, and have the chance to form a relationship with a pony, who do you ship yourself with?
heheh
Because I stumble upon Mt Poniator once here.
in Rarity channel
find another OC to Keep hasbro pure
he pops in alot but i never see him say much
00,02d3rb, its just stupid, they cripple the os's performance for reliability reasons then cripple reliability for performance reasons
Yeah, I suggest about a good scene for his animation and suddenly he replied!
I was like "Whoa! Mr Poniator here?
00,02what you end up with is broken crap like this, where i have zero control over what drivers are loaded and one of them breaks everything
DoctoDoctorWho: I ship myself with my husband's OC... If I ever manage to get his OC's design down. :P
come on, I know at least ONE of you has dreamed of dating a pony
Nah.
I will always want Rei Ayanami :p
rei ayanami pony?
Gold_Demona: Huh, kinda threw me a curveball there
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Eva pony huh.
Hmm, emotionless pony...
Java: He's actually on most nights, as far as I've seen. Not the most talkative, though.
DoctoDoctorWho: You didn't say it couldn't be another OC. :D
Glad to know.
Thanks for the info.
Java: Scratch that. He's on right now. In here.
He's been AFK for > a day though
Id be pullin a tony stark and pimpin EVERYPONY!
He is? well Mr Poniator, I just want to say Hi. And great work you do for th community.
DoctoDoctorWho: Even Granny Smith? :O
Now if I can pull my lazy ass and making something.....
This used to be my avatar image for lots of stuff for a while~ :< http://derpy.me/WS-uo
except granny smith
Gotta love Rei
:D
How about Mayor Mare?
Yeah, he original Nagato
the
Rei is supposed to be a complex character.
That's why it's sad when she died and her clone don't remember anything.
She kind of is and kind of isn't
:(
Gold_Demona: ya like to poke holes in the term "everypony" dontcha?
What if I'm a dragon?
you can't call me everypony...
DoctoDoctorWho: Just making sure you actually mean what you say. XD
Holla everypony! :)
Hiyo GilDash
Helli!
Gold_Demona: fair enough, mayor mare is safe from my pimpish wrath
Mayor Mare is alonely mare.
Poor Mayor can't even organize stuff.
Cheerilie's forever alone and doesn't give a buck.
Im sure she's already mareied
Or she's a playa when she's young.
She already gave too much buck
:p
Im not allowed to touch cheerilee
Clearly her husband disappeared in 80's after he contracted bonitis
AHAHAHAHAHA
She belonges th DustyKatt

Ya think?
Don't you worry about mars let me worry about blank
I wish we can build space elevator soon.

Well, there are us lurkers.
Java: Ive been here since 2
Hiyo Lil_B
I'm here just when GF ended.
It's still evening here.
It's 7:34am over here in Florida
Hello Lil_B
Gotta love Timezones.
Hello
thanks Gold_Demona and AdamTheDuck :)
I've been up for three and a half hours now.
Whoa, what time do you wake up Gold_Demona ? 6_9
7 30 but everyone still asleep.
Sunday
I'm usually up at 4am every day, except for Monday, at which I get up at 3am.
Because husband. I make his breakfast and pack his lunch.
soo... I may have to change my Nickname, or at least use another name as an Artist... because I didn't know that there already is a Rapper named Lil'B and some people already confused me with him
Why they make him go into work so early is beyond me.
It's common for a couple countries to start their day early
Lil_B: You didn't know? .-. Did you think of the name on the spot?
In mine school start at 6.30 or 7
Lil'Brony?
XAX I honsetly have never heard of him, I used Lil because of guys like Lil' Richard and B because it's the first letter of my real name
My cousin work on Samsung factory, he have to be ready at his office at 6.30
hell you might have to check and see if that one's not taken
Lil_B: Damn. Well that sucks :c
Well anyway, try puting this as your wakeup alarm Gold_Demona :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OLJXVGh0ss
I get up at 4:15 every morning, run 3 miles, shower, then start my day.
XAX thank good I have only made one real sopnmg that people heard so far XD
I heard in countries like S Korea and Singapore some of the employee don't even go home.
Although it works better when you're making a cup of coffee at sunrise :P
Lil_B: :o
They simply sleep under their desk and laundry their clothing.
AdamTheDuck: I usually have my coffee like an hour before the sun think about coming up. lol XD
In Japan game developer tend to not go homr for DAYS.
hello lads
Hello dishwasher1910
Hello dishwasher.
I have to stand up for school at 6:40 (before I used my car I stood up at 6:10) and during my apprentenceship I stood up at 5:30 :/
I already used to wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning.
XAX Mutterguy I see if I can come up with something, I tend to be horrible in choosing a name >.<
A habit now.
AdamTheDuck: That's a very groovy song tho. I dig it. :3
hell I thought someone might have considered using my username before me
bye

Eeep, one more song Gold_Demona before Phase4 brings stream up again :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvGL63o827g
00,02which is absurd, because the error was not occouring in vac

But I'm listening to Luna Waited right now!
Anyone knows about this movie? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqYkm559tA
I think this movie will be quite scary.

But with a video recording now.
Also the character quite xreepy.
Oh well, here's something funny then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7bXoeoMsY

We need to show that movie during Friday Movie Night.
Then vote for it~
Where do I vote?
There's a vote?
I thought it was a lottery
Sign up for the newsletter
Well lottery I mean :S
Newsletter?
You're sort of voting for a movie in a way
Sort of, but not really
Maybe an email will suffice.
It's pure chance. =P
Asking them nicely works too.
I mean, that's a hilarious movie.
You have to sign up for the Newsletter to enter the lottery
The lottery is how they pick the movies and episodes every week.
Sorry guys need to afk for a while.
For me I'll just continue voting for Forrest Gump every week :$
I don't enter very often, but when I do I always put in Castle of Cagliostro. :>

For the Woony Woona Wepubwic!~
oh hey AdamTheDuck how are things
Ohai alexxm

Might be due to doing nothing productive for 72 hours~

Hello Phase4!
So Phase4... How did your experiment with that xbox in a microwave go? :3
00,02ohai MadSurge
00,02AdamTheDuck, didnt get it hot enough
Didn't "Is It A Good Idea to Microwave This" do that?
I'm pretty sure they did
00,02didnt actually microwave it
Gold_Demona: get in the newsletter and cast your favorite movie! :D
00,02its a microwave oven
00,02i ovened it
Isn't a microwave oven a microwave?
May we ask for the purpose of this experiment? :D
I thought that was the same thing...
Just microwave is the short version
I've posted so many youtube links :S
00,02Gold_Demona, convection oven
Ah
So not a microwave oven. :P
00,02microwave ovens heat via 2.4ghz radio
00,02the one i was using is combined microwave/convection
00,02i used the convection bit
Heh
00,02actually microwaving it is pointless and stupid
Never heard of that. That's interesting
00,02ohai Dumorimasoddaa
I've seen an XBox being microwaved. It's... interesting.
00,02Gold_Demona, lots of prety lights i imagine
The casing melted and then the thing caught fire.
what happens to it Gold_Demona
I saw it on a YouTube show called "Is It A Good Idea to Microwave This?"
Ohai phase
00,02Gold_Demona, ah, that shows always fun
Phase4: It was fun. Too bad I discovered it like a season or two before they ended it. :P
I think the XBox was one of their earlier ones
Like right after their college dorm room seasons.
Gold_Demona: Xbox deserves to be microwaved :D
^
^^
The only good thing they have is Cave shooters :D
I love ost's like these, something with soul and emotion, none of the upbeat crap nowadays :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHZrDe3mFvQ
Yay so now i got some 5 hours till i have to go out and eat with the family
Hehe, happy birthday bday_killerpony7733 :P
Thanks
bday_killerpony7733: Happy birthday! :)
GilDash Hehe thanks to you too
bday_killerpony7733: What are you going to go eat?
happy birthday killerpony7733
happy birthday bday_killerpony7733
GilDash Asian place. They have a interesting thing where you got a buffet and you take various things and add it in whatever order and give it to a cook at a cooker plate thing. :D and they warm it and everything and even cook the meat you take
It's a good place i'm gonna eat at
Sounds neat.
bday_killerpony7733: Aye, I know the kind of place you mean. Have fun! :)
Happy birthday :)
Ive got a question for everypony
And yeah, there's a restaurant that does something similar near me as well bday_killerpony7733. :0
I expect we've got an answer.
* :)
Eminently possible, GilDash. But you never know. :P
New Lunar Republic or Solar Empire?
(also, good afternoon everyone).
Lasharus: Collectively we must have some kind of answer. Even if "I don't know". XD
DoctoDoctorWho: Eggman Empire.
how are things Lasharus
I'm good, cheers.
Hello GilDash! Whassup?
And yourself?
DoctoDoctorWho, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YkVbTAhL-c For the Woony Woona Wepubwic!~
Lasharus Yeah it's a very interesting thing and i just love having noodles and some kind of raw meat added and then cooked with corn
bronies MScoot aloo on youtube is doing a live stream and he has only 3 viewers ATM so help out and watch? http://www.livestream.com/mscoot
MadSurge: Wazzup! XD
Lasharus They got a interesting sauce they add as they do it too
Which country, out of curiosity?
Lasharus If you ask where i live, i live in Denmark on the west coast
(Yes, I know it's Asian cuisine, but which country are you in :P)
Ah.
Im a Solar Imperial myself, I just wanted to keep tabs on the heritics:)
Okay, so no, it's not the same restaurant as the one near me.
/me marks DoctoDoctorWho on the hitlist.
DoctoDoctorWho: Your allegiances mean little. The Eggman Empire will conquer whichever world the doctor wants to take over next!
For Woona~ :3
(Me? Fanboy?)
Lasharus: cauze the eggman empire has been SO succsessful as of late, or should I mention a certian blue hedgehog?
*certain. And feel free. I'd like to mention the fact that were it not for Sonic, nobody would be able to stand against the Empire. Doctor Robotnik has every great power in the world running scared to that blasted rodent.
Lasharus: Shh! Quiet before they hear you!
Lasharus Shame on you!
:D
Bah, I've got an Ask Dr. Robotnik thread running now, so whatever. :P
Astonishingly, I started that one for a laugh a YEAR ago.
I'm currently answering questions on page 101. What the hell happened?
and the solar empire has rainbow dash, who everypony who's worth their bits knows is better, faster, and tougher than sonic. so good luck with the invasion, your going to need it.
You underestimated the fanbase, obviously.
I'm NOT running it on the SEGA forums GilDash. The fanbase, quite frankly, scares me.
And DoctoDoctorWho, very true. I'll adjust tactics accordingly.
Lasharus: As I said, you underestimated it. XD
Or rather, the doctor will. It's not for me to predict the next step of our glorious leader.
Good point, GilDash. :P
@_@....
I do get genius questions in my thread though.
"Why are you called Eggman?"
...
cool, roleplay.
Actually Kurra, I'm trying to restrain myself a little. :P
RP? No RP to see here! >_>
<_<
Pff, turn off the safeties and let it ride....
Well, letting the Egg Dragoon II ride free will probably cause all sorts of property damage...
morning
Lasharus: Im not afraid of a fat man in a hoverchair, The solar paladins of the Ordeo Malleus will crush you all as heritics.
Morning Bronysith.
Good morning Bronysith
how are things Bronysuth
The Ordeo Malleus? If memory serves, and my Latin isn't TOO rusty, doesn't that translate to "the evil/unwilling order"?
Lasharus: Order of the hammer, actually
Oh no, evil would be 'malus'
yes, finally got another song done :)
does anyone here like Majoras Mask?
um
of course
it is
You're right DoctoDoctorWho. :)
my fav zelda Lil_B
:)
I really haven't gone through my latin in too long if I made that mistake. :P
Bronysith my sec fav Zelda :) just after Link'S Awakening. anyway, My song is a Cover of the Final Hour music in Majoras Mask
ahhhhhhhhhhh
WHOO!
/me comes in with a sack full of bombs
Ohai Pegono|BlueLantern
Hello, AdamTheDuck. :P
/me noms on one of the bombs
NUUU! THEY ARE HIGHLY-* bombs explode *
DoctoDoctorWho: "Nox Aeterna."
ooooooooooooh game grumps snowboard kids 2
GoW 3.
GilDash: "Ovum"
:3
:P
ohai GilDash :3
Lasharus: What? XD
Latin for 'egg' :P
... NYET!
Lasharus: No, I know, just don't see how that relates. XD
Sorry, I just couldn't resist :P
"Eggman Empire"?
Lil_B: Holla! :)
brb
WHOO!
Lasharus: Ahh. Well, "Nox Aeterna" means eternal night, so you can guess who's side I'm on. :D
You went for eternal night, our other doctor went for the solar empire, so I went for 'egg'. :P
I only know the Latin I learned while readin Asterix :/ like "Ellea acta est" (I fi wrote that wright)
Yes, I got there. :P
"Alea Iacta Est", Lil_B.
"The die is cast"
And Asterix is a worthy read. :)
Okay, seriously, this latest question on my thread just worries me.
"in principis"
"did you ever notice the amount of BSDM kink there is in some of the Sonic RPGs in the SEGA forums?"
............WOT.
wat o.o
^3^ /)?
Asked in my "ask dr. Robotnik" thread AdamTheDuck.
The question, and the asker, now worry me. Greatly.
hia rdibp :)
hiyo rdibp
no stream huh?
i miss snowboard kids
and my n64
Nope rdibp, and hi :P
Lasharus: you should just have Robotnik facepalm there :D
no as in yes or no as in no?
Remind me to get a Robotnik facepalm image. :P
/me kidnaps Lasharus
Oy!
There's no stream at the moment. :P
My latinis vaugely limited to translating english terms derived from it sadly
I was answering questions on my thread!
man Netflix is amazing
:P
/me escapes from alexxm.
The nerve of some people.
/me glomps alexxm
Also all franchises have terrible pervert fans :D
/me captures Lasharus for alexxm
r4
Can anyone view the stream on android phone
/me and gives him a cookie :P
/me teleports away.
/me does take the cookie though, thanks.
*munch*
TEL'POR' MAWWIO!
Lasharus: dammit, you were a second away from getting a cokkie :(
But I got the cookie.
/me blink packs next to Lasharus and brings him back to titan, where he can be safe
Lasharus: suuuuuuuuuure you did
Well, what else did I just eat?
Oh, my own cookie.
O_o
Oh well, a cookie was had, that's all I need to know.
And now I'm apparently on titan.
Remind me to bring the Egg Carrier back to active duty. It seems I need a flying fortress to get some solitude around here.
00,02i wonder
Of course they will. Greatest genius of all time DoctoDoctorWho. I don't let my mind succumb THAT easily.
/me glomps Phase4
/me 00,02hugs Bronysith back
finally got my Pony CD done, I managed to sqeeze 26 Pony/Bronys releated songs on that Disc XD I'm looking forward to the next time I drive my car :3
Nice. :)
oh hi therte Phase4 :)
/me tacklehugs Phase4.
i think more sleep
Hi.
Kurra don't just think about it :P
/me 00,02hugs Lasharus back
00,02ohai Lil_B
of course, the alternative is being corrupted by chaos and being hunted down with extreme predijuce, or get eaten by tyranids, or necrons, or orks, or eldar, or...
REDDIT
00,02stupid windows, i wanted to try for jool orbit today
Y U DOWN?!
00,02but windows broke
wow, we've got a real crapsack world goin on dont we?
00,02and now i have to reinstall
CORRUPTED by Chaos? I stole a few Chaos Emeralds off Knuckles ages ago (left him a few fakes. He's so easily conned). They can distil and counter Chaos Energy at a whim.
Phase4 WiiU supports Unity engine now, there now is a chance of Kerbals on the WiiU XD
sonic is a horrible franchise
WRONG!
SEGA did horrible things to a decent franchise. :P
00,02Lil_B, that would be AWESOME
00,02two screens for ksp!
And Dr. Robotnik is awesome. Like it or not.
00,02i can manage orbits on one and have cool rockets on the other
Phase4 well, the developers have to löook into the code again a little biut, but it certinly is possible now
00,02Lil_B, if they actually did that i'd instabuy a wii u
i am going to buy a wiiu to set it on fire
Phase4 you really like that game uh? XD
00,02that i do
Hey guys
hi JunkerKun
Heya everypony!
/me glomps JunkerKun
how are things JunkerKun and TheMonstaMuffin
hi JunkerKun and TheMonstaMuffin
Hello JunkerKun
CHAOS EMERALDS? If you think "controlling" chaos with a bunch of multicolered rocks, then I am the master of the winds of the earth because I have air conditioning! WITH SETTINGS!
Bronysith but burning plastic isn't good :(
Hi alexxm and Lil_B. alexxm things are good. You?
alexxm: Not bad. Just bought new pony miniaures
*miniatures
That's nice DoctoDoctorWho.
Hello TheMonstaMuffin
i'm good TheMonstaMuffin
TheMonstaMuffin good, just finished a song :3
And it's not about controlling chaos with them. It's about harnessing it. The Chaos Emeralds are perfectly ordered constructs designed to encapsulate pure chaos energy.
Also, I can't believe I'm going through my headcanon here.
Hi AdamTheDuck. Good to hear Lil_B n' alexxm
Lasharus: that pile of gravel you call the master emerald does not controll a fraction of the warps energies
Believe what you will. I can't really prove otherwise because I don't currently have the Master Emerald with me.
Knuckles finally figured out that the piece of paper on the ground saying 'master emerald' wasn't actually the real one.
Hehe
Only took him two months, that's a record for him.
Phase4: most adorable Derpy gif EVER :3
My internet is trolling me
00,02MadSurge, ikr!
http://fav.me/d5br46m My phone wallpaper :3
All seems to be working fine but stream just doesn't want to load
JunkerKun, because there isn't a stream up. :P
AdamTheDuck: Oh...
My mpr3-player wallpaper is a minimalistic version of Chrysalis XD
F*** =/
mp3*
chrysalis is worst villain
brb
Oh well, now I haz teh this: http://rghost.ru/40530016/image.png
Although I would like more fanart about Derpy not being a retard :D
JunkerKun that's one pink cadence :/
Bloody hell.
That is entirely too pink.
Lil_B: Yeah, wasn't too enthusiastic about this. But hey, at least I have Gilda
JunkerKun: HAHA Gilda toy!
I think I may have permanently impaired my vision.
JunkerKun oh you bought these 2 packs?
Lil_B: Yup.
Pinkadance :D
http://fav.me/d5b36lu Don't question why, question: "Why not?"
Lasharus: I have an Idea, lets post a picture of our 2 weakest forces, then debate who wins.
AdamTheDuck: although I question "where" :D
Lasharus: who is your worst mook?
brb gonna update my browser, if I'm not back in a min than something went terribly wrong...
AdamTheDuck: Wh...why...?
Because chikens riding space sharks with laser beams in space.
What, Dr. Robotnik's worst troop?
AdamTheDuck: Eh, works for me
Technically, I suppose that'd be the bog-standard Egg Pawn.
Useful for crowd control, but useless against a pressed attack.
for standard assault, here's an ultramarine http://derpy.me/Ji-JQ
and those guys are pussies
Oh, you swapped to a different franchise?
I thought you were still on about Celestia's Solar Empire.
No, an Egg Pawn could probably be taken down by that.
Lasharus: oh no, I meld the solar empire with the Imperium all the time
You could've given me some advance warning.
and I'm back
ohai again Lil_B
what about Celestia?
Well DoctoDoctorWho, this is Dr. Robotnik's latest personal battle mech. I think it should suffice:
http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402101825/sonic/images/a/af/Egg-dragoon-sonic-generations.png
mornin'
If you look really carefully, you can find the doctor in there.
yea, in the waist cock pit
(and OOC: I bloody love that thing's design :P)
you know, I like Game Soundtracks... I collect them... But there are some games where really have to think why there is a buyable OST ... I'm looking at you Amnesia and LIMBO
00,02Vordox, you there?
Lil_B, have you heard Red Orchestra's? :<
Phase4 he's not in the chat
00,02Lil_B, not sure what you meen, he's in this channel
AdamTheDuck only heard of it
And even if my head canon is wrong, Celestia and the god emperor have been homies for some time now
AdamTheDuck: Meh, I always turn music off in this kind of games
Phase4: ... you are right... damnit Brain
Not exactly DoctoDoctorWho. In fact, if your headcanon is wrong, it is precisely untrue that they're 'homies' :P
Lasharus: hmmm, seems like a match for the collegia titanica
You realise I am completely ignorant of Warhammer stuff, right? :P
JunkerKun, but imagine charging into battle to this :< : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq2LbxjwGzU
Lasharus: forgive my slang, the Imperium I presume would be no less thal allies with the solar empire
Possible, if unfeasible, unless we're going by the 'solar dictator celestia' fan-interpretation.
AdamTheDuck: I don't know. I like this one better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6PMJYoaGf8
In terms of orchestral score Nobody can really beat ANNO http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fps7itq3_XY
to bad games like these fall under the Radar nowerdays :( at least Ubisoft is kind enough to still pour a lot of money into this
Yeah I miss the days where graphics weren't everything to a game.
00,02urgh, trying to reinstall windows using a crippled windows install
yay in 30 days
00,02this might take a while
I found it, basic units in a titan legion. http://derpy.me/KSgES
JunkerKun, may I ask when that song is played?
00,02AdamTheDuck, the advance of gaming is driven in part by the advance in graphics
00,02AdamTheDuck, case in point: portal, its a game that could not have existed on previous generations of hardware without some serious cutbacks
dats a BIGASS Chainsaw
'in part', yes. But these days it's as if other advances fall by the wayside for more shiny lens flares.
00,02and not at all on 2d
Phase4, I'm talking about games like Battlefield praise for it's visuals.
AdamTheDuck: When Shephard becomes a Spectre
Battlefield 3 praised*
Take Final Fantasy XIII. By god it was pretty. By god it was shit.
00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, thats always been anoying
Lasharus: Well, the game itself was pretty good. But it wasn't FF we all like
00,02but the increase in gpu power has allowed games that could not have been made possible
00,02and older games that look better
No it wasn't. The weapon system was an impenetrable mess, the crystarium was a rehashed sphere grid, the characters were completely unlikeable, the music was uninspired, the battle system had several glaring flaws... but at least it looked pretty.
I've always taken more interest in the ideas and psychology behind some games.
00,02AdamTheDuck, so while battlefield 3 sucks, the money its pouring into gaming hardware is doing good
ANNO 2070 can look amazingly beautiful, it's just that these kinds of games just aren't as popular anymore. All RTSs nowerdays are standing in the shadow of Starcraft
I suppose we're done here and moved on?
Ooh Lil_B, have you heard some of STALKER's soundtracks?
I've no idea, I'm just trying to keep up.
00,02something like rage is really interesting
Lasharus: I don't know. I didn't like itmuch but I wouldn't call the game complete s**t
Morning, everyone! :)
Lil_B: what of C&C 3 Tiberium wars?
00,02morning AJIsAwesome
although they kinda made ANNO a bit too overcomplicated now that people who are new too these kind of games are scared off way too quickly -.-
AJIsAwesome: Hey
Morning AJIsAwesome
/me glomps AJIsAwesome
Yeah that game looked interesting but I heard so many problems with RAGE Phase4
I would. Too many obvious flaws they could've ironed out before release, JunkerKun. They ironed a fair few of 'em out for XIII-2, I'll give 'em that.
/me hugs Phase4 JunkerKun AdamTheDuck and DoctoDoctorWho :)
But XIII-2 loses all the points it's scored and then some for its ending.
there are only 10 final fantasies
DoctoDoctorWho yes, but that was about the last one that really got a lot of attention, and how old is that one now?
Why?
00,02AdamTheDuck, aparently it fails as a game, the interesting bit is its engine
BECAUSE IT ENDS ON A TO BE CONTINUED SCREEN.
AdamTheDuck no, I have tons of soundtracks, but almost none of them are from FPS games :/
Lasharus: Wait, XIII-2 already out? O_o
:<
00,02AdamTheDuck, 'megatextures' in practice meens MASSIVE environments are possible
Yes. It's been out for a while now.
Lil_B: I wouldnt put it over 10 years, but how old is starcraft?
And literally, I am not kidding.
In the middle of the ending, stuff suddenly goes to hell, the screen goes black, and you get "To be continued"
00,02AdamTheDuck, look at any rage screenshot, theres no terrain in the skybox, its all rendered
Well f*ck right off then Square.
DoctoDoctorWho Starcraft II I ment, but I was mainly just talking about the Product name
Phase4: Didn't only ID Tech 4 used "megatextures"? I thought that in RAGE they dumped that technology
Phase4, yes but my friend couldn't experiance Rage's unique atmosphere when it took half a minute to render all the textures :<
00,02XD
And mind you Phase4, it's not like his computer was old
00,02AdamTheDuck, yeah, that was a problem, opengl suport is crappy on windows
00,02JunkerKun, the earlier versions used 'virtual textures' or something like that, same tech on a different scale
Lasharus: That is... sh*t O_o. Square Enix, what the hell are you thinking?
00,02JunkerKun, id tech 5 was built around the idea, in theory it allows clean scaling of graphical quality to many different types of hardware
00,02the intent is to remove the burden of worring about hardware from artists
Who knows, but I do know that I'm not picking up any more Final Fantasies unless literally everyone says 'okay, so this is the next Final Fantasy VII (or VI, depending on preference)'.
Lasharus: Final Fantasy is been like that for a while :(
Very true. In my personal view, X was the last good one, and that one already started to suffer from issues.
final fantasy 6,7 and 10 are my favs
(They were entirely too proud of having somewhat mediocre voice actors, primarily :P)
Phase4: yeah, and WE still have to buy a very powerfull piece of junk
anyone played XI? how was it?
After a while I wanted to strangle Tidus. "Live and let l-" *shot*
00,02i've got ff 10 for the ps2, havent managed to play it for various reasons
Lasharus: It says something when Heroes of Ruin had a better ending that still was a blatant sequel hook
00,02JunkerKun, yeah, engine needs work, but its a step in the right direction
00,02away from 'OMG PRETY GUNS' and toward enabling artists to do amazing things
Heh. Dungeon Keeper II outdid 'em there. They put the sequel hook in the main menu. "DK3 trailer". Not kidding. :P
AdamTheDuck: The first one. The second one has only one good track - Main Menu theme
AdamTheDuck I was about to download it, but than it got deleted by the uploader -.- I was inmterrested though
Sadly, then EA murdered Bullfrog, so part 3 was never made.
JunkerKun, yeah 2nd one was a sort of disappointment.
Lasharus: Nah, they will give rights to another company. And will kill the whole series
Though Syndicate wasn't bad actually
/me licks Jmo :P
AdamTheDuck I have Stuff like this: Mother, Mario, Zelda, NIER, Paroius, Phoenix Wright, Kirby, Castlevania, YS and a ton of Inie Game music
No adam, no.

Hay bacon strips, hay bacon strips~

Instead of a cherry on top, or ice cream, bacon
Bronysith, why do you visit /b/
And chat is ded?
CrimsonPhoenix: why dont you visit /b/ ?
Nvm
00,02aparently mentioning /b/ kills the chat
It's a deserved result.
I guess so.
Phase4: As is according to tradition
Bronysith, because it's a cesspool filled with retardation.
Today I learned that there is such a thing as the world championship of team pie throwing
Close, CrimsonPhoenix.
the people in /b/ are morons
I usually call it "the biggest cesspit on the internet"
y'know, /b/ isn't as random as it used t obe anymore
Great minds think alike.
Lasharus, thank you
it was never good
00,02Unnr, i should find that absurd but the awesome overpowers that feeling

R.I.P chat.
I am CHAT SLAYER! *sigh* Nopony likes me.:(
let's see if this wakes people up http://youtu.be/7QfY2yA2zh8
hahahahah so many spaghetti stories on /mlp/
Dken2021: I actually saw that a while ago. :D
Brothers and Sistahs, we are gathered heah to mourn the passing of Paddington T Chat. May the gods have merc-ha upon its passing.
Unnr: PA-RAISE DA LOOD!!!
From dust the chat came, and to ooze it shall go. Shoo-be-do.
Have a random video, I guess. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCEKT2JdOk&feature=channel&list=UL
Well anyway Lil_B, a very average soundtrack STALKER has, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRRGYEFZF4A although you had to see what was going on while I heard it to understand the strang atmosphere of the game.
he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him...... because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a Silent Guardian......a Watchful Protector. A Dark Knight... "
strange*
AdamTheDuck did you just waited unmtil I'm in the chat again ? XD
someday imma just gonna shoot that smartass mouse
I was typing it then you left XD
So i just copied it in case you came back :3
ah good ol' kirby songs
I should learn from this
In my Ignorance, Have ANY warhammer 40k nerds Entered The Chat Without My notice?
I've only played the RTS games for Warhammer :S
40K*
Dear god, does that xkcd image ever ends?
AdamTheDuck sounds really good I like this accoustic guitar
Dken2021, name me any Kirby song
the first one that comes in your head
butter building
ooooh nice
Because I would love to nerd discuss 40k with anypony willing
Factory Inspection
AdamTheDuck here is sommething in the direct opposite direction, but although with guitar :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFC7ouHpQ2s
ooh, neat one, and from my fav kirby game
miracle matter
Dken2021 I'm exited for the 20th anniversary Kirby Collection for the Wii, especially for the Soundtrack CD
Heeh kinda good but doesn't beat O^2
oh yea, heard of that, hope it's better than what they did for mario's anniversary
AdamTheDuck: do you have a favorite space marine legion/chapter?
I decided to stop by as well because it was getting dark, and travelling in darkness is hard. One Stalker took out his guitar and started playing the song at 1:45,
but as for final boss theme my top favorite would be Drawcia Sorceress
Dken2021, IT IS
The OST has 45 songs
DoctoDoctorWho, tbh I like the Tau :P
FORTY-FIVE
hi :I
Hello CCCP
hello AdamTheDuck
and the new challenges are boss
and this is weird Lil_B xD
lali-ho CCCP
hi Dken2021
Also there's three episode of the show in it
In what context is this song played Lil_B? :D
and the artbook is like quite filled up
AdamTheDuck: god have mercy on you if anyone gets within a mile, 9_9
since it tells you some info about everygame
also six games
CrimsonPhoenix I like that I will be able to play the older games withou t having to buy them on the Virtual Console (although I did played msost of them, on an Emulator before
13 if you count all the ones in superstar
looking at it right now, sweet, looks waay better, and kirby deserves it
Lil_B, still it's nice to have as a collection
CrimsonPhoenix and historic events... the first geneticly manipulated Tomato come on the marked -.-
CrimsonPhoenix definitly
and 64, dreamland 3 roms are broken anyway
AdamTheDuck whats your most favorite genre in terms of Video game music?
HUD in 64 doesn't update well
Lil_B, orchestral really.
the foreground in Dreamland 3 isn't transparent
that's in emulator
whelp, nopony likes me and nopony wants to listen to what I have to say. Imma go outside
no stream? :C
Lil_B, but more importantly it needs emotion.
AdamTheDuck good, Thats my second fav (and what I listen too the most, because my actualy favourite is just so rare to find XD)
http://youtu.be/tqKrsO5MiCM my fav final boss theme
AdamTheDuck nice I have something for you :3
Lil_B, like that STALKER guitar track, although it isn't orchestral it still brings the idea of some morale lifting spirit in a shithole alternative universe.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/40a5e1032bde30609e8c8d39016108f4.jpg human Applebloom and Appleteeny! :O
Galacta Knight's also a good song, surprised me the first time in KSSU

vye AJIsAwesome|AFK
CrimsonPhoenix I like that mix
Kirbys Mass Attack had a nice soundtrack too (and if you listen closely yoou can hear that they used the same samples as MOTHER 3 XD )
Dken2021, it's in the game btw
CCCP: yay, Meatboy!
yea, I've seen some of it
MadSurge ^-^
Kirbys Return to Dreamland Soundtrack was good, but I kinda thought it was meh :/
Lil_B: and some Air Ride too
It's strange to see chat so alive on Sunday :D
hey Blako
Usually it's so quiet at this day and hour
Lil_B: also, miniboss theme from the N64 game :D
And Kirbys Epic Yarn has a funny story behind it's soundtrack XD
Lil_B whats the story?
CCCP there are 3 major Composers at HAL who worked on the Kirby games since the NES, Jun Ishikawa, Hirokazo Ando and... another one
hi
Lil_B, I kinda agree
hhe
"the other one"
but I do have to say
Kirby Epic Yarn had an AWESOME OST
Very sweet and calm
yup
CCCP and when they god the unfinished Kirbys Epic Yarn (Hal took it over from another company) they just couldn't get the same natural feeling as the original composer had
Well I'm off to sleep. Goodnight everyone. :)
nighty AdamTheDuck
Lil_B, that song wasn't what I expected when I saw Donkey Kong Country :D
night AdamTheDuck
Lil_B oh
night AdamTheDuck
hello Gold_Demona!
bye AdamTheDuck :)
Hiyo CCCP
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMZOLB2iKq4
CCCP they met up with the old composer, but even he couldn't help them, later tehy just used "Natural Instruments" like real Pianos to get the same feel
CCCP http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0el2sGcfo0
and there is aa Video of Hirokazo Ando playing the Green Greens Theme on a little Air Toy Piano
Lil_B oh
also
Lil_B, from what I read there were 4 major composers
at HAL
CrimsonPhoenix :o awesomme
Ryunosuke can you give me the names?
CCCP that video is old
00,02in a surprise turn of events windows did something right
Shogo Sakai, Jun Ishikawa, Dan Miyakawa, and Hirokazu Ando
how goes?
Ryunosuke I think Shogo Sakai may also be one, but he only ever worked on one Kirby game
Phase4, explain?
00,02it left my grub4dos setup when reinstalling, allowing me to easily replace the windows bootloader with grub and get linux working with minimal effort
when ever people talk about HAL it makes me think of 2001 a space odyssey
CCCP they named themselfs after theis HAL :P
well he also did music for Mother 3 and SSBM
Sorry Kirby but I cannot do that
Lil_B :o
Ryunosuke and a major composer and arranger in SSBB
ah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IkvAb6THQY
I loved the Kirby Arrangemens in SSBB
Even have burned them on a CD XD
I love the jazzy metaknight theme
I think my Fav is King Dedede's Fight Music
dat technoy feel
00,02good thing too, windows forgot how to ethernet
that boss medley was good too
00,02so i need to boot into linux to fetch the ethernet drivers
00,02now i've done that back to reparing windows
http://youtu.be/Bytvxk97kzY FOUNTAINS OF DREEEEEEEEEEEEAMS
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emt0VbR95Zw
quite good
I honestly didn't like many of the arrangments in Brawl
I hope I won't chatch cold, because there isn't good weather outside
From what I'm aware of, you can catch a cold because your indoors too much
but thats orignially from melee isnt it?
http://youtu.be/S7ENqv0gsWs Melody goddamn Town
Best level
Thats why more people get sick in the winter, they don't go outdoors as much due to the weather.
hi
Dken2021, that's what it was
hi sheep
yo sheep
i'm (momentarily) back!
but yeah if you play with the wii remote alone
hi Dark92Enigma
well, I go out sometimes, but only sometimes :D
it FEELS like Kirby
CCCP yea, I think SEGA was in charge of the cutscenes iirc
with the double press to dash
there isn't much to do
anyway in excited for Super Smash Bros. Universe
Youl probably be fine
CCCP I'm excited for JAPAN TIME
so how's everypony doing?
whats that?
Super smash brothers is dead
hopefully we won't ever experience the great maze again, oh god why
Dken2021 yeah that was painful
so...........twilight_sprinkle and Wrek won with my movie picks......meh, close enough
I hope so, bc I have to duiscus my graduation project with teacher
gotta find another A movie
Oh? whens your graduation date?
hi Dark92Enigma
c(-'.'- c)﻿
http://youtu.be/6z30c6tXd8s
the great maze was the best part of Brawl
you know, watching ''Birdle Gossip'' last Friday night reminded me of an ATHF episode (the classic one)
the BROODWICH
in the 2nd part of spring maybe, it is still a lot of time, I just need to choose which project would be the best (I have 2 quite ready)
I like everything I like so far about the new SSB, not more than 50 Characters, HAL is working with Namco on it, the original creator + the Guy from the Tales Series, and I hope they pull the same Stuff Muisc wise like last Time XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUKB6EFPvqc&feature=relmfu
Is part of it a speech?
if theres an Universe Brawl, i hope one could create their own characters
i lost Kirby's Epic Yarn though :(
Dark92Enigma i heard a rumor that you can play as a mii
mii?
Lil_B: so, new SSB crosses over with Namco?
They got about 30 different people working on the Soundtrack, Uematsu, Shimomura, Kondo, Hirokazu Tanaka, and everyone elso whos name I don't know right now
Dark92Enigma, what, no why
MadSurge I don't know Storywise, but Production wise yes
because lol Namco
Uematsu? Tanaka? Shimomura? oh god this will be excellent!
Lil_B: Splatterhouse crossover plz :D
hey guys Heihachi in Smash
yes, I will have an application which I will talk about - something like presentation. And also I have to have about 30 pages of text (can have illustrations/code) with it
CCCP: what is a mii?
Dark92Enigma you know those creepy little avatars you can have on your wii?
CCCP: oh, those straw ones?
So the project is part of your major in programming?
those characters made of CGI straw?
(*the application I made)
Yep
yes
I see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mii
Is Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie an A or B movie?
Definately sounds like a challenge
(i guess it's an A)
What's the rating?
Hang on
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrL0rLqdyE8&feature=BFa&list=SP43377079F186ABA5
Lil_B, I, sorry for the expression, jizz upon hearing that
yup
my most favorite song in Airride
CrimsonPhoenix no prop, I love this song too XD
Id be very happy if ponies were in the next SSB but that will never happen
CrimsonPhoenix: 6.8
Dark92Enigma, it'll be B movie
damn it..........
i already have a B movie in mind
We should watch Birdemic
gosh I need to play some more Kirby
The Mask?
I'm currently voting for Manitous Shoe everytime for B Movie, and the Seven Samurai for A
6.8 for the Mask..........damn it
wow, with that new system even the mask would be be.....
B**
btw, has anyone else heard about the remake in the works for the seven samurai?
im sad because i cant vote for movies :'(
CCCP why not?
almost have everything sorted
Lil_B its complicated :(
OK........my B movie pick is a surprise, but i'm not telling ya
spongebob movie eh? let's see.... it's got 6.8/10, and budget was 30,000,000. made 85,416,609, yup an A film

Dark92Enigma, large buget, counts as a
Dken2021: what movie?

CCCP you have to wait until next friday to vote
Dark92Enigma But i CANT vote :C
Spongebob the Movie... The only Movie I have even seen twice in a Cinema
CCCP: what did you do to anger the mods?

Lil_B: did you like it?

CCCP: >_>
Dark92Enigma back than? Yeah! now... I can watch it again
Hello everyone :)
hi MLP_Brovakiin
hey MLP_Brovakiin
Lil_B: for me, it was the end of Spongebob, you can call it a ''closure''
MadSurge no, but its just im mysteriously already registered... But i never registered my nick
CCCP: Why you can't vote?
Dark92Enigma what i told MadSurge
Dark92Enigma: the end of spongebob, not including the like, 8 other seasons that were better then the ones before?
maybe 5
Do you have the application done?
since spongebob only has 9 seasons
cowvarkian: YOU'RE kidding, right? the first 3 seasons were CLASSICS......the 4th season was still on, but 5th to 7th were stupid for the most part
Dark92Enigma: meh
ohai MLP_Brovakiin
yeah i agree i find the new spongebob really bad
Dark92Enigma: I agree with you mostly, but I like the newer seasons as well...
I don't find them as good as the prior ones honestly, but they are ok
but i have only watched 2 new episodes
cowvarkian: I haven't seen pretty much of the 8th or the 9th season.........but they were better than the 5th to 7th for what i could tell, it's TRYING to come back to their style
Dark92Enigma: yes
well, not yet ( 1 is about 60% and the other about 30% - I will propably choose the 1st one ), there is still time, there are some still som people who don't know what project they will have
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/3939b6d1e32926d1ac3e92ab5cb1f7c0.jpg :3
also i've heard that the 10th season will be THE LONGEST EVER
lol
wow... just found out that even Der Wixxer has a english version XD
has the power puff girls ever been streamed here?
CCCP: Not that i know
i guess not
thats depressing
didn't Luna streamed it afaik?
CCCP: I've seen them streamed here
I have seen a Poster about thje return of the Powerpuiff Girls next year
cowvarkian really? good
Lil_B: not sure if want
cowvarkian I'll try to find it again
well powerpuff Girls was made by Faust wasnt it?
CCCP: she had some part in it
Lil_B: WHAT? THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!
cowvarkian :3
it is not clearly programming ( it is called technical lyceum )
CCCP: her hubby did it, she came on later
oh... Well she did Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends right?
I belived she was producer of that too
Yesh :3
:D
here it is https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/19/TkReTUgOHkWUH0p1s9_IvQ2.jpg
CCCP: also Frankie is based on her :)
CCCP: I think that was mcracken as well
*spelling?
wow
Lil_B that made my day
Dken2021 nope Lauren always only was a designer ond/or Storywriter, MLP was her very first Cartoon as a Producer
Lil_B will she have any part in Season 3?
2013...........a whole YEAR!???
OH COME ON!
Oh well....:)
I do not have this from any official source, bnut I'll say I will trust this and that I want to believe XD
CCCP: she didn't really have much part in season 2, if i remember correctly
CCCP she was only involved in the first 3 episodes of season 2, I don't know what she did for Season 3 :/ if she did anything
And yet look at how much ponies rocked cowvarkian :$
MadSurge: ye need not tell me
we still have LESS of a month to find out
The problem i have with the brony fandom is unfortunatily it scares away alot of people from the show ;~;
27 days left FOR AN ANNOUNCEMENT
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/37765e2bc1cad4f90c75fbd3c7792b09.jpg hahahaha I want this mascot to exist! :D
Lil_B =/
hehehe
MadSurge lol
i love this fandom easily,
hey guys
CCCP: by shoving down other people's throats? that's not my style
ah hey there alexxm
Dark92Enigma: indubiadly
Dark92Enigma yeah, i know but many do
hey alexxm
Dark92Enigma: not my style either, just vague allusions :D
Heya alexxm, how are you?
MadSurge: vague allusions are best allusions
and quite honestly the show is awesome but you'd be lying if you said it wasnt overrated
CCCP: A bit.....i'd be lying it's PERFECT.
um
but it's still AWESOME
MLP isnt overrated
like
at all
yup
its a cult following
you sure about that?
so therefore it is not overrated
MLP is under rated
I never said OVERRATED btw
^
how are things Dken2021 cowvarkian and MLP_Brovkaiin
so earthbound isn't overrated?
Dken2021: nope
heres where my whole reinstall windows plan gets clever
hi alexxm
alexxm: pretty good
things are fine alexxm
i have steam and steamapps on a different partition
Great thanks alexxm
MLP, Legend of dragoon, earthbound are very underrated
how are things CCCP
alexxm okay u?
so in theory, i install steam, put the symlink i had in place back, and bam
all my games are installed
alexxm how you're doing?
i like Mad Men :3
i probably assume to much and it wont work but worth a shot
CCCP: I used to watch that
OH wait.....my mom is calling, see you all later
cowvarkia USED TO? >: (
CCCP: yes, as in past tense
Phase4: do you have any applications installed, or do you have that much space in your computer? :D
cowvarkian why not anymore?
CCCP: because I stopped watching it?
MadSurge, on windows not much, mostly dev tools that i needed to reinstall anyway
cowvarkian why?
most of my productive time is spent in linux
CCCP: I just stopped liking it, it got boring
CCCP: if someone doesnt watch it anymore it isnt a big deal
=/ peronally at first i didnt like it then i started to like it more
CCCP: well, I also dislike just about every character on that show, so yeah...
cowvarkian lol
its funny how one of them was Cole Phelps
I like AMC shows, but they're characters are so easy to hate...
*their
I never liked Two and a half men or the Big Bang theory
Big bang theory is quite enjoyable
Family Guy is horrible now
CCCP: hmm
I have returned Bronies, What have we in discussion that I may Partake in?!?!
hai DoctoDoctorWho
Hello DoctoDoctorWho
Family guy has always been horrible
^^^^^^^^^^

?*
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/sample/305fc2dbd8bd01d6af2c6f83b4537657.jpg :D Death found the perfect steed
CCCP well kinda hard to step out of the mold if yuo've been trying to get a show like family guy on TV for years
DoctoDoctorWho because after Family Guy was cancled and came back it sucked
CCCP: wasn't it canceled twice?
/me hugs CCCP, MadSurge, Dken2021, and alexxm
okay, opinions are opinions are respectable.
except yours MadSurge
Dken2021 but he made TWO other shows that follow the same formula
/me hugs ASoftFluffyThing back :3
I'm doing fine, alexxm. Just getting some pizza for braekfast and watching TV. No stream?'
no stream
DoctoDoctorWho: :D Discworld's death is a swell dude!
Okay
MadSurge: There is only one true steed that instills the fear of death itself on the feild of combat
wait while I fech it
So you may post youtube links now ASoftFluffyThing
MadSurge: Okaaay
Also, my face when Starship Troopers is coming on in two hours on the SyFy channel
I've noticed that a lot of movies we watch on BronyState are starting to come on TV....
and I'm back!
lies
I watched Creepshow two days ago, we should watch it on Bronystate too :D
MadSurge yes we should!
MadSurge: Be warned, merely looking upon this steeds very form is said to instill madness, do you still continue?
did my posts get thorugh before I d/c?
DoctoDoctorWho: I've seen VERY bad stuff, go on
MadSurge: A few weeks after we had Dark Crystal for A movie, it started coming on TV. Like, four days in a row.
ASoftFluffyThing: yay then :D
MadSurge: I always imagine death's leigons riding on, *shudder* these http://derpy.me/5dAwJ
MadSurge: I watched it all and did the chantings because why the fuck not?
DoctoDoctorWho Why would you post that here? :'(
DoctoDoctorWho: :D G3!

CCCP: quit complaining
