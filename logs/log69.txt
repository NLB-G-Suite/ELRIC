internet is srs buziness
hey you ever read Densha Otaku it works
opinions everywhere matter.
No more or less than those of random people you meet offlines, RainbowDoubleDash
I like the mods
Sure, sounds hilarious/enlightening
^
Is it pony?
Yes.
Everypony is entitled to have an opinion... but only mine is correct.
hmmmmm that sounds pretty good
Then YES
I'd like that :P
MOds are the coolest
0Well either opinions matter or they don't
6And yes, Circuit Mane, I am Pyro
Sounds like it'd be good.
*Insert Neutral Response Here*
Hmmm
I like the mods. They keep me unbanned and stuff and I am gratful.
I would never doubt it
0Wait, the hell? @ Rainbow "oohoohooh"

Possibly.

Alright, I have got stuff to do tomorrow and I need my sleep. I'd like to thank those who selected the movies and the episodes. WWU and Army of Darkness NEVER get old. Across the universe and Sonic Rainboom are also fun. Have a great weekend everypony!

Good Morning Everypony.
0There's something about this song

double stream
Its kinda soothing
Denied_Existence: Well I have a few already lined up but I can see about getting you in. Have a skype?
I assume stream requests are over since Epic Sax Spike is playing.
would you make love to this song?
never get tired of this..... maybe
0It's like, it turns me on a little but it just keeps looping so I feel kind blue-balled
it's mind numbing after a while
0*kinda
HEY Mod
I'm doing a DJ-Pon-3 cosplay for BroNYcon. Started a thread about it too. If you could be so kind and please comment on it or just keep bucking it it would be awesome! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35725602.html#i35725602
@CircuitMane yep, same key, underbar and all
Can you write in a Text Document *Good Night Everypony* And pull it across the video!
Enjoy your weekend! :-)
PLEASE?!?!
good night everyone
Show up naked... Celestia does it to all her formal events
0every pony does
Goodnight everypony
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 14 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
0Night

CircuitMane, I could pull it up right now if you want to test the connection
Celestia is such a troll..
12;-;
0How much longer is this video 0o
I just found this line in a fic
Lunar Republic ftw.
I can't sstop laughing
despite being kind of a twat, Angel was very perceptive
90s flashy leather jacket if within budget
What fic?
Some shipfic on FF.net
/me test
It's called the pit for a reason.
0I hate when fics make angel an asshole

They didn't, but THAT LINE.
K thanks Roara
Fly me to the moon plz
0lol
This story is supposed to be serious.
0The hell, lol
That makes it 100x worse.
fanon and serious don't go well together
/me Can you write in a text document "Good Night Everypony!" and put it on the top half of spike??!
0Kind of like Campfire Secrets
I got a MegaUpload link, but MegaUpload is schizo with mr
*me
0I love that story, up until Rainbow says "candy vag"

http://forums.sgclub.com/singapore/aids_girl_sg_360235.html <- This is insane
I'm judging the story, not you
btw
I read all fanfiction including clop. Although the aforementioned is actually usually hilarious.
0Yeah, other than that odd line, it's a great fic
Is there a fanfic where AJ deals with her Alcoholism?
0lol
Uhh
There is an fic where ... Twilight Rare and AJ get drunk of Apple cider/wine
There's some abridged stuff?
A sleepover at there place
0Scrumpty Apple something
Campfire Secrets was epic.
The sequel, not so much.
0Yeah, the sequel was eh

YES MA'AM!
on it!
I go to sleep at 7-8AM
Now that's scary.
/me pokes Kyu
Ponies ponies ponies
07o3o
I have one rule about sleep:
0SWAG
You know what i find very awkward, fanfics where ponies curse and talk about sex
well if its among the mane 6
after 6, fuck it, and stay up all the next day
I don't think so.
Not if you do it right.
03stupid phone ads
I love the night so much more than the day... so much more peaceful
Not for me books, if I can get 2-4 hours it makes a HUGE difference
I'm addicted to the night now
I say fuck the day
03"Only AT&T lets your iPhone talk and surf the web at the same time" <- I can do that with my Droid, moral of the story is DON'T BUY A CRAPPY IPHONE
Coffee makes a huge difference.
I don't use caffine
I use Luna
I inject it into my veins
0It's all down to execution @ sex and swearing in ponyfic
Caffeine is one hell of a drug
caffine, not ponies.
^
I wish I could inject ponies.
=D
well if its about OC ponies i dun mind but i can't really imagine the mane 6
inb4 news calls ponies a drug
03AT&T ads make me want to kill someone
well mayb AJ
Rarity + Twilight
fox news maybe
03though LOL @ these ads, which I just will say are nsfw
RD + everything
Holy hell1
03and this is on the History chanenl
fox news is hilarious
0A few pairings work better than others
Appledash.
0DashiePie works well, imo
its so entertaining... in some countries... it's even illegal!
I just read the comments on Campfire on EQD, and Butterscotch offered to edit it and the sequel.
HE NEVER RESPONDED.
Ok is the mod still here?
Or is this on auto loop?
I like the idea of SpikexPP, personally.
Any1 read the Story where the Mane 6 go to alt universe wit gender switched versions
Pinkie pie doesn't work well with anypony, I tihnk.
Indeed
too asexual, non-human of a pony
/me puts kyu on his head
07.-.
0Yeah, Cross and Arrow is great
I don't think so at all.
I 100% don't trust fox news
I can't see her caring about any kind of relationship
Anything on that is retarded.
0I agree most of the time
0but some people make it work
Cross and an Arrow is promising, at this point.
Cross and Arrow is pretty weird, wat would it b like if you liked your rule 63 self
Except for that she goes insane without her friends, and that she's good at being serious when it comes to them.
Ok folks
I'll believe it when I see it
Especially secret-keeping.
Not going to say it's "good" until it gets a bit further in.
The Empy Room
Or whatever
You read it?
SAX :3
mine's 1.29 GB
If you break up with pinkie pie... let's just say I hope you lived a full life
What
inb4 because its lossless
Cupcakes will still be my favorite fanfic
XD
yup
Her relationships are some of the few things she is serious about.
I take it we're in the Intermission?
...
Oh, sheeit
nope. post stream
the Derpy and Dinky ones make me teary eye
[SPOLIERS] The Empty Room or something, it's basically Celestia finds a hidden room of her daughter.
Oh...it's all over?
Also, ton of good ideas in this thread.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35700328.html
SAM Broadcaster unfortunately can't play FLACs
03you don't use Winamp?
yup. streams start at 7 EST on fridays.
;_; @ Dinky
Ah.
I don't anymore
you can doubble the size to WAV
When did the movies end?
Amybody read Silent Ponyville?
like when they tried to take Dinky away cause they thought Derpy was too stupid 2 take care of a filly
can SAMB play WAV?
I read Silent Ponyville
yup
6WTF LOOP STOPPED
I liked it
03what is SAM Broadcaster then
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-empty-room.html
03is it its own media player?
That's actually the third story down on my list.
That story
Yeah, it was pretty well done
12?
IT'S OVER
MY GOD
I still need to finish FO: E first.
I've been meaning to read TER
ಠ_ಠ
I thought it was cool, but it wasn't spectacular.
SAM Broadcaster is what i use to DJ for my Radio Nintendo show
Then start Dangerous Business.
the software looks complex but its easy to use
I'm so fucking Depressed at The Empty Room..
THEN I can read Silent Ponyville.
Oh, god, Dangerous Business
also it wasnt free, but *cough*torrentedit*cough*
i like the one story where Twilight uses a spell that works like the Animus
so guuuuud
03but why do you need it instead of using winamp?
Apparently it's good.
We are at 40 and wearing down
I read all the way to chapter 11 or so of TER.
But I dunno.
03also I misread it as "torrent edit"
how many chapters of past sins are there?
I REALLY liked only a few fics.
Then the author... Gosh..
13?
13
atm
so far
its designed for Radio Shows, plus Winamp may be easy but its not what most of the DJs on RN are using now, so i switched to SAM
What, I can't change nicks in here?
August = UPDATES
the author posts in clumps
Okay, seems doable.
3 at a time
Any other jazz tapes?
for wat fic?
FO: E, Past Sins, that ALan Wake crossover...
Creeping Darkness Bash
Twelve was freaking amazing.
I am trying to decide what this reminds me of
Djemba: People were spamming it.
Oh
03why do you need something fancy though
03if I did DJ'ing I'd just use winamp XD
I don't do that sort of thing :S
Hmmm....who is that guy who does the art show and paints 'happy clouds'?
Bob Ross
Thats it
you know who was awsome, Mr. Rogers
I'm addicted to watching this video. The Luna dance in the bottom right... gosh..
White dude with huge red 'fro, was parodied (quite amusingly) on Boondocks
Hell yeah
I
I'd be his neighbor
wait
LUNA DANCE IS MESMERIZING
that sounds
Mr. Rogers was an awesome man
he's cool is all
And yes, Mr. Rogers was a genuinely good man.
03well
Until Kira killed him.
Dam u Kira
u noe the way Kira died was pretty lame
it crashes when i try to close winamp or go into the menu settings
Musta missed that episode of DN
well even gods die
Spike can play Saxaphone with one hand...WHAT CAN YOU DO!?
kira is not a person
Depends on which version of the show you saw.
kira is a concept
Manga or anime.
well i mean raito
other people were "kira" for awhile
;p
lol engrish
Evey took over for him to rebuild =D
Yagami was a person
Kira is what everyone calls the murderer.
It's his name, to them.
Kira is a god.
The voices are telling me scary things...
They are looking for Kira.
I've got such a headache.
: O
That means a person.
WOOOOOOOOT
Kira coming from the word killer.
I woke up Thursday with such a bad hangover...
They thought of him as a person,
I GOT MY CLASSES
awesome
It's a name/title.
03told you you would :P
because they thought thwere was just one person
Your looking too deep into this Bash
"Go ahead, shoot! You are only killing a man!"
but Kira is anyone who kills int he name of kira
usually with a death note
No.
you now wats a good anime, Gurren Lagann
So what what now?
?
Anime?
I AM CONFUZZLED
btw Aurora, those links to the soundtracks, the tags are all in japanese x___x
Confluttershy
I liked what I saw of TTGL
WHY YOU NO LOGIC!?
They say there's another person who kills like him, so they called him, or in this case her, the second kira.
The second killer.
I got to about just after... uh... his death
lol
But who was Fone!?
and haven't picked it back up uet
*yet
I found out why they were filled up so fast
basically
people have this option to add them to the worksheet
The show went downhill for me after a certain some1 went away
Kira is not always spoken of as a person, It's not a tital for a person
but you can't actually ADD them until they day
Oh hey
people look for Kira, but that doesn't mean they're looking for a person
but by adding them to your worksheet, it apparently still counts as a seat
since you're putting one on hold
Anyone got the THundercats Premeire for DL?
but as people finish their worksheets
WHAT A TWIST
wish, heard it was good
they drop the courses they dont need
Can we quit with the bullshit Death Note philosophising? XD
Flootershai
and now I'm actually having trouble because I get to DECIDE which classes i want
Yeah they are.
NOTES OF DEATH
ZE MAGICKS
lmao
lets talk about Metal Gear Solid 2
ARE SUPRISINGLY TASTY
They are clearly looking for the person.
thats some trippy stuff there
ftp://pkmnmusic:pkmnmusic@fma1394.hoshinet.org/OST/Japanese/2009/74%20NDS%20Pokemon%20Heartgold%20Soulsilver%20Music%20Super%20Complete%20[FLAC]/
but I got two required art classes
Watch the ending confrontation in episode 2 again.
these FLACs' tags should be in english
and three GE classes
not just electives :'D
L isn't looking for a God.
or atleast, the filenames are
He doesn't even believe they exist.
TWIST ENDING
The sax is eating into my brain
He wants to catch the murderer, and in his eyes, it's a person.
03ugh, stupid Weed drink, naming alcohol after illegal drugs is like the worst of both worlds >_P>
03-P
at that time, kira was thought og by L as a single person comitting murder
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6571625 Anypony wants to see Thundercats 2011
Are you arguing with yourself or what?
Is anyone else talking about this? XD
It's an alias.
Talking about what?
Luna...dance...stealing...brain...
Death Note
gah....
I am.
Epic...sax...stealing...brain
any1 watched Big O
Light Yagami (夜神 月 Yagami Raito?), also known as Kira
If Twilight Sparkle found the deathnote... lets just call it the "BanishBook" Do you think she would use it?
square square square
TO THE MOON WITH YOU
I don't think so.
She seems very afraid of Celestia banishing ponies.
She knows the power.
THE PONY WHO'S NAME IS WRITTEN IN THIS NOTEBOOK SHALL D- er, uh, BE SENT TO THE SHADOW REALM
Plus, there seems to be too little crime for her to use it much.
lol shadow realm
I made my point and I see I cannot convince you otherwise. I will say that I see "Kira" as a concept and not a person but you seem to accept otherwise
Let us all carry on.
I am back
okay, I need to sleep
so does any1 really believe the U.S. is failing
I'd say Kira is a bad example of this symbol thing, because Kira died
Kira is neither a concept, nor person....IT IS A STATE OF BEING. This is being said by somebody who has never seen deathnote
and that the E.U. and Asia will repalce it
Yo.
Maybe V from V for Vendetta would be a better example
I accept Kira as a god, so, yeah.
well they NEED to increase the debt limit first of all
We can both agree that the Light/Ryuk fics should never exist.
they should
!
true to that Bash
See? Even a clueless person can be smart sometimes
:D
I would love Kira to exist
aw, shit, man, really?
dude that would b horrible
Not what I'm saying.
...That sounds like a bad idea
USA Debt. Ha
What a joke
I'm talking about a horrible slashfic pairing.
>.<
Kira CAN exist... just get rid of organized religion
hey lets not bring that in here
huh?
hm
So...like the USSR?
Kira would become a religion.
Or somesuch
we has a drf
I'd rather not talk about religoen here
Just like in the show.
03yes we do
if all palaces.
Ok...thats it, I must see this movie
Spirituality is fine.
Yeah, forcing it's no better that itself
watever floats ones boat just dun force it on me
At the point you try to fuck with people's lives because of it, you and I will have problems.
w/e just forget about it
Like the Catholic church calling conspiracy when the media called them out on their kid fucking.
dude.
Religion works like this: We know that the energy in our brains dissipates to some other place when we die. Where that is, is entirely up to you.
I'd prefer rational thought to spiritiality or whatever, but that's me and only me
Did you guys see that story a while back about the pope's visit to Malta?
Therefore, we make our own religion by our beliefs
We know what now?
hows it been going man?
03alright
Anonymous replaced pictures advertising the Pope's visit to Malta with Pedobear.
lol
XP
Anon you so classy
Sorry, scientist in the room with the religious discussion makes nobody happy
Like, the posters were the same except for it was pedobear instead of the pope.
Oh hai guyz I'm atheist
:(
Hey guys, let's not bring up religion. That's a good way to turn friends into enemies really fast.
I love the internet.
Sweet dreams everypony
Going on experience here.
A theist? GET HIM
Night
see.
Believe whatever you want.
Discussing religion with redditors is never a good idea.
oh, wait, you said... my bad
Haha
I never leave happy.
ya if Friendship is Magic taught us anything any1 could get along with anybondy
I MUST DEFEND MY POLYMONOTHEISM
Hey I aint causin no trouble
As long as we all agree that RBD is a lesbian.

This brony just sayin'
nah i cant
DEFEND MY MONAURAL SOUND SYSTEM
I agree with that one!
RBD is so lesbian
well i mean personality wise
thats a racial thing XP
yep
nah
nah?
I will defend RBD's HONOUR TO THE DEATH.. she is merely a BIWINNING WHORE
Not because of her personality, but just because I wanna ship her with Pinkie Pie.
...
lol
BECAUSE I CAN!
OK, LETS GO WITH THAT
A gay guy should not be so obsessed with lesbian shipping.
But I am anyway.
>.<
any1 seriously believes that men aren't men these days

How can men not be men?

OHO
I am not a manly man
but I am okay with that
because ponies.
I see what you did there....
Men aren't men? Who's to say? I say, death to traditional gender roles! Who's to tell us how to be men?!
Men are men by definition...

Is there a reason why Luna is significantly smaller than Celestia? Was she merely suspended in time?
Maybe
she was reverted to her younger self

She just puts a big dumb smile on my face every time I see her
The party scene in the Philomena episode XD
0Fluttershy > Twilight Sparkle > Pinkie Pie > Rainbow Dash > Rarity > AppleJack
0It
:3
0s a pretty close call though
I like AJ
She's just not as special as the rest
barely
0Indeed.
bbl, wish me luck for my piano comp
0She's... stereo-typical i think
Eh
0I love all teh ponies, just her less.
She's dependably
*dependable
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3cRWJcZjW4&feature=related
If that makes here boring, then, that's that
0RBD > Fluttershy > Pinkie > Apple Jack >> Twilight Sparkle > Rarity
0All the ponies are dependable.
12wish you fantastic luck
0Rarity and AJ are the two least popular, I guess?
0From all I have seen.
0eeeeeeyup
Well, depends on who you ask
Some say "Rarity is the best pony"
0they also have the least screen time
possibly ironically *shrug&
Eeeeeeyup <3
0like derpy
12this site is scary drf lol
0doctor whooves
0Luna
0my god the fanbase for them.
My favorite Applejack moment is the "Cain't hear you. Ah'm asleep. *honk-shew, honk-shew*"
03XD
12http://most-expensive.net/foods
So adorable XD
XDDD
12there you go
honk-shew honk-shew~
0can't believe the fanbase for Luna... a character that got like two lines and was never heard from again
12a little something to sink your teeth into
12then run when you see the bill
Well, she's interesting in concept
0and also a princess.
0how are you supposed to write her back in?
She's gone. . .
0she's ruling with her sister
Luna is forever gone. . .
0she's easy to write back in, i tihnk
Unless she comes back and is all shoop-da-whoop
03LOL
0i'm hoping she's in the pilot for season 2
03well I'm starting to get tired
02[The current time where I live is 0303:39:5602 on 03Saturday, 07/30/201102. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
0a brony can dream.
Well, she's not gone
03I just have to fix my clocks since the power went out and reset a few of thjem
03*them
She could have fit in easily at the Gala, for example
12i know what time it is there dude
Did you not watch 'til after the credits?
She was deliciously devoured by Ursa Major
0>_>
;D
12it's not too hard to take my time and add one hour :P
Oh
0Not okay.
0D:
I'm just kidding with you. . . ;A;
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdJT_KY5_s&feature=related
0I figured.
I'm debating. . .
0It's all but confirmed Luna is going to be in a season 2 episode, but I can't fathom how she would act
0debating what?
0she may very well never be spoken of again
Gah, I dislike Pinkie Keen so much
I recorded myself trying to sound like Fluttershy. . . but I don't think I should upload it. . x.x
0but yeah, I'm no script writer.
The episode Pinkie Ken?
Keen*
Yeah
Mmmm. . .
0The ending, I understand
Me neither. .
It was kind of. . .
0Lauren Fasut apoloized for it
Well, Twilight was kind a douche throughout
0the wrote a whole blog thing about it
0so it's okay.
I have a pet theory that helps explain the episode, in a way that helps me feel better about it
0http://www.mylittleponynews.com/2011/02/feeling-pinky-keen-controversy.html
The episode's moral isn't about blind belief in something
It
is about the willing suspension of disbelief
0Yeah, the moral could easily have been changed to something better and still in-context.
Pinkie isn't some unexplained pheonomenon
"Some interpret the moral, and the episode, as implying that it's bad to search for explanations for things one doesn't understand."
She's a cartoon character
^ This person. Is an idiot.
Not you TTG >~<
0?!
/me 0I'm the only other one posting
No no~
Twilight Sparkle is a rational mind trapped in a cartoon
THe quote I put dow
down*
0oohhh
0okay.
And Pinkie does things that defy explanation
03woah, power spike
03my battery backup started beeping
we take that without questioning because it's just a show
0don't worry about that episode... just have faith that it was all for the best
03luckily the darned clocks didn't go out again >_>
0it's a god episode but the moral is poorly worded
03that's really odd though as it's not storming at all so wtf is going on with the power
0It's good to know that so many people still love the show even if it psudo bashes atheism
0which a lot of the fans probably are, at least on reddi
0t
0its a difficult morale... but sometimes you have to speak from the heart and take a stab at it
So, in a meta sense, Twilight believing in the Pinkie Sense without questioning it makes sense because of the willing suspension of disbelief =D
03anyway off to bed, I'm about to pass out
Yes, I

High on PINKIE PIE! 8D
0[?]
oh shit
XD
a plastic bAAAUAUAUAUGH
0What do you think Pinkie did at that rock farm anyways?
XD
0I tihnk it was an exaggeration.
Do you ever feel, like a plastic BLARGHARGARGH?
12o-o
0she thought she had such a boring life, it was liek working on a rock farm
And that's how Equestria was made!
0so that's how she told the story.
0exactly.
12o-o
Makes 'em go, BAUAGH, BAUAGH, BAUAGH
I saw a comic that gave a possible explaination for the rock farm
There is old alchemic beliefs that gold grew within rocks
And Equestria is pretty magical
so, maybe that has something to do with it
0farming for rarer materials?
0That makes since, but sounds more interesting then Pinkie would make it.
Growing rarer materials in rocks
Eh, I'm sure it was abore
0Pinkie: If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!
most of it is still pushing rocks around
0I'll stick with my Theory .
Yeah, I thought pinkie may have been exaggerating when I watched the episode though
It's her character!
Killing Joke line, and all
Not to mention possible contradictions
Grammy Pie, skating since she was an itty bitty twinkie pie
etc
0indeed.
Party of One suggests that she did indeed have a flat mane before the rainboom, though
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5BnG07C7H0
And was lonely and sad etc
T^T

shame on you :3
It was 2L of perry, 1/2L vodka, about 1/4 of a bottle of lambrini
But I'm always fine in the morning anyway.
12LOL I hate it when stuff like that happens
nice
I think I fell out of the tree and cut my stomach.
win.
lol
wait
dari why are you drinking lambrini
dari dari dari where did it allll go wrong
Because that's what the girls brought.
>girls
They always bring lambrini.
it should be -you- buying the lambrini for -them- so -they- don't remember what -you- did.
I brought lots of perry.
2 2L bottles. :P
YFW my parents bought those for me to take
My mum bought 2 cases of perry while I was away too.
Probably for my party.
INB4 RainBro turns up then
YFW i can buy alcohol myself
also: I'm going to your house party
whether you realise or not
as am I
wat
already on the flight
YFW you had to find people who would sell to people <18 before you were old enough.
YFW i didnt start drinking till a week before i was 18
Someone sent me this image about a month ago.
MFW British teenage life is actually more like the first one
ikr
our lives rock
Also, how did I only just notice that the second image is the inbetweeners?
LOL
Omfg I feel ashamed
Yawn
Went rowing with sister
Splashed her a couple of times xD
RainBro: What did I miss with the stream?
Also, I should really make the system to get the channel names automatic, and usable by other people
Dari: since no-one is here, it was pretty rubbish
Huh?
No, how was the stream yesterday, what did I miss?
a few people tried to enjoy the movie, 90% of people hated it even though they'd never seen it
and they practically ruined it
I'm confused.
and we lost 1/4 of viewers when it started
Oh.

Hi.
Ohai Silverscreen
11MMPR remake movie premise: Zordon and Rita are from rival alien races, the former which tries to protect the galexy while the other looks to destroy it planet by planet. Zordon manages to trap Rita in the moon, but becomes unable to live in normal atmosphere anymore, thus has to live in the Command Center on earth while being looked over by Alpha 5.
11 1,000 years later, Rita escapes her prison thanks to Goldar, a descendant of Rita’s old faithful servant. Him along with Squatt, Baboo and Finster built Rita’s new command center on the moon, from where Rita starts to send a reign of evil onto the earth. Zordon, unable to battle Rita himself, calls upon 5 teenagers with fighting abilities to stop Rita.
11The sequel would consist of the green ranger storyline, and the third part of the trilogy focuses on the character of Lord Zed.

Too much cute in here. No more Fluttershy.
11This chat gave me diabetes
dat plot
Too much cute? When Fluttershy is involved, there's no such concept as "too much."
Dk
Don't worry, Silverscreen. Army of Darkness can cure it.
DIABEETUS http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/0b7ce217b669b4f99a21bc0ba00c4bda/34569%20-%20angel%20Drink%20fluttershy%20glass.png
Army of Darkness was weird
I think ponies are immune to diabetes.
11No, Across the Universe was weird.

By the way, was it the theretrical or director's cut we watched last night?
Also obesity.
it had everything DS2 had, but it never felt like an actual bad movie
http://mibpaste.com/QRiEGf
im bad at pictures
dem links
@Nittany_Tiger don't call her fat, she's already an anorexic model
I didn't call anyone fat.
o.o
"Also obesity" meant "Probably also immune to obesity."
did someone say DIABEETUS? let me treat that for you http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnenbgYB3K1ql5gvto1_500.jpg
7nice one
hello
Damn you, Smolder. I should sue Flutternurse for malpractice, because my diabeetus is now worse.
OH PLEASE GOD NO!DIABEETUS!HELP ME BLACK DYNAMITE!

If someone had a diet equivalent to Pinkie Pie's, they would weigh 600 lbs and have a shriveled pancreas and have an average sugar level of 400.
trying so hard to restrain myself from insulting Fluttershy over here
And be dead tomorrow.
6there they go again
No, just in need of treatment for diabeetus.
It's sad.
6 30 seconds
well, Pinkie also moves at incredible speed all the time, so it works out
im the only user here what
Because sweets and apples should be a part of your balanced breakfast.
I wonder how long it'll be before parents completely miss the point and accuse Pinkie of being a bad role model >.>

Mostly I'm just laying out the idea and worrying about if simply featuring characters from another series counts as a crossover.

I could watch Black Dynamite again....

awwwww
@interior_gummy that version was one of the few good vids they posted in the past couple of years
A play? I jelly.
MLP is made for guys in the 20-99 age bracket, though.
ping
I read it on the internet, it's true.
>18
I think I like this vid as the new promotions video. :D
@RobotPinkie youtube says >18
what play?
Does that make you all too young?
I hope it's awesome, DSN.
not a good one

MLP was built to order for Viking mauraders to watch while they wenched and grogged.

seussical I think
I'm sorry Apokalipse :(
Articuno Must have been island >v>
My preferences range across a large age range.

inception
6It was decided shortly after you left last night.
11...is Universal still making movies? it's been a while since I seen their logo
6Or... this morning.
I missed most of this movie yesterday to cooking, CONFOUND THESE MEALS THEY DRIVE ME TO EAT!
attack of the killer tomatoes
That Universal logo music makes me so nostalgic.
i never got why luna was so popular other than being cute
Ponyception and Attack of the Killer Ponies
thanks!
I'm think I'm hungry, I'm gonna pizza it again. You guys wanna pick toppings?
attack of the killer tomatoes is going to be awesome
i mean, she has literally no personality other than nightmare moon
I heard of another guy who didn't see inception yet
@Maximus italian sausage
anchovies!
next week's gonna be awesome
9Testing... again?

Eps are dressed for success and best night ever :3

That's exactly why she's popular, Interior.
I didn't see inception yet
6Next week is Suited for Success, Inception, The Best Night Ever, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
Well i'm glad I must have done something good

Yeah. All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up. See this? This...is my BOOMstick! It's a twelve gauge double barreled Remington, S-Mart's top-of-the-line. You can find this in the sporting goods department. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Retails for about $109.95. It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger. That's right. Shop Smart. Shop S-Mart. YA GOT THAT!?

Reloading is overrated!
or just jump
0do a barrel roll
Anybody know how mobile the ammo for that thing is?

Well, you could live for an extra 700 years.

4Some news for Xbox 360 fans, Microsoft has released an animal themed costume pack for purchase. There's an alligator, and even, you guessed it, a unicorn as well.
PIZZA

Pillow talk, sweet
if I lieth with thee, wilt thou fight the demans?
Unicorn?

Yay! More virtual crap for ugly-ass avatars.
Is the unicorn purple and/or white, Ghosties?
4For your avatar

10Ghosties, I. *Runs to Xbox Live*
4The unicorn is white
To spend real money on.

Does the alligator have teeth or not?
Look at the mad special effects!
Ohai Harryhausen bat
4Yeah, it has teeth

X-box avatars are UGLY.
What a shame :(
Does it look somewhat MLP?
Is this movie intentionally this bad?
4Wait, maybe it's a dragon...
I like Xbox avatars. :3
I think so ing
this movie is great
Too bad I never play my Xbox anymore
sorry forgot to say goodbyes

Hug for victory
Hrmm, video isn't working for me. Tried it on different browsers. Would anyone know why?
cant he write them down or some shit?
too much elder scrolls

i prefer the original ending where instead of forgetting words, he forgets how much he drank and takes too much.
8|
WinstonChurchill: What if he was the /origin/ of that STD?
Wah wah
I'm not sure, HeavyMetal. What degree of "not working" is it? So laggy it's unwatchable? Not showing up at all?

How does one fire a shotgun like that?

and later with source
I want a link to that song now.
valve is oulder
Get the axe!
4Haha, nice. I actually haven't seen any other Bruce Campbell film outside of the Evil Dead films and "My Name Is Bruce." Though, I have seen his work in Burn Notice
well that movie was... something
source is newer
03o.o
8soundtrack needs moar flute
watch bubba hotep
That movie was AWESOME
Haven't seen that. :(
needs more cowbell
movie needs moar barrels
he plays an elderly elvis who fights a monster with jfk
We should rewind it and watch it again and again and again and again
Saw My Name is Bruce though
also, Deathstalker 2 is still better
6GET THE AETHER MOD OF MINECRAFT SO YOU CAN TAME A GIANT DINOSAUR BIRD AND RIDE IT AROUND
6there I said it
4Oh man, you should. "My Name Is Bruce" is an awesome homage and parody to the b movie machismo of Bruce and his characters like Ash
12LOLOLOL
Also saw The Man with the Screaming Brain
6and she was here
03LOL, Arti, which server are you connecting to?
So that's it for today's BMN?
directed by Bruce, I believe
Just imagine if Bruce Campbell had been the main actor in Deathstalker 2.
special dead is quite a strange movie
this one has kind of bad pacing
12BOTH XD both kept pinging out on me, I reset my router and modem just now though
retarded zombies
03odd
the ds1 protagonist is kinda like ash
What's Burn Notice?
4If Bruce Campbell had been Death Stalker, I guarandamntee that film would have been 20x better
03ocean was pinging a lot earlier but my server was stable as ever XD
12LOL
4Burn Notice is a spy show on USA
ds2 plays up the comedy more
This movie is the best Bruce Cambell movie in my opinion.
@Ghosties 20% cooler *fixt
ahhh, need to check that out
hulu has some episodes of burn notice i think.
Can't watch Hulu from Sweden :(
my name is bruce, man with the screaming brain and bubba ho-tep all suffer from serious pacing issues

Itty bitty little widdle twinkie pinkie! <3
I love twinkies
Inb4 penis
again my fav line
"Twinkie" for Twilight/Pinkie is the second best-sounding ship name after Flutterpie.
I watch this for the plot http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/61471b2496d6eed21cef8a98e2500477/4839%20-%20fluttershy%20macro%20plot%20rarity%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
*faceice*
Totem pole!
Tuba: I'll see your Twinkie and raise you Apple Pie.
Hmmmm. I seem to have lost the stream.
did anyone see the behind the scenes vid of this?
So, Pinkie Pie found time to skate between rock farming?
crasheriffic
brb
DragonRage still thinks DashiePie is the best sounding ship name.
Another fine choice, Elky.
How 'bout Rainbow Pie?
@Nittany_Tiger_ probably from the period where she lived with Granny Pie
Pinkie works well with everyone... 'Moon Pie'
I don't remember that part.
Pielight Sparkle
That... makes Pinkie's childhood timeline make a lot more sense, Smolder. Thanks for taking a weight off my nerdy shoulders. :D
Nightmare Pie?
Poor porcupines :(
Flutterpie. Apple Pie. Rare Pie.
I get sad when I think about how Spike will outlive everypony by thousands of years.
yep... it is sad
why would dragons live for that long?
10NOT THE BEES
Indeed. :( But we did get a great fic out of it in The Centerpiece of My Collection.

SNAAAAA-KEY
I don't think it's a good idea to even wake up snakes when there's still snow around
Then...OVERPOPULATION!
That one Dragon in Dragonshy was going to take a hundred year nap.
Dragons must be very lonely creatures :(
They learn to live in the moment.
they ease their pain with money
Anyone been watching the torchwood thing? Imagine that in Ponyville.
Well, they take 100 year naps
Maybe they just sleep all the time when their turn adults?

Or cast one on Spike. Oh, the ethical implications!

Best plot
ASS ASS ASS ASS
10ReticentSmolder >mfw that's the first thing I see when I come BACK to this chat after looking at that picture you sent me again
Yep. Buxom really is better.
There's a chance Twi would get turned into an Alicorn eventually anyway.
10GET OUT OF MY HEAD ReticentSmolder
I have a guitar, I'm a brony, and I don't know how to play this BGM
Is something wrong with me?
10yes
eeyup
Get to learnin' it, man.
Spike, you're doing it wrong
forever apone twilight
inafter Applejack being perfectly reasonable
We don't take kindly to unicorns around here!
I've always liked that idea, Maxaminus. One alicorn for day, one for night, one for Twilight :D
Pssh, everybody knows Derpy's the third alicorn
Rainbow Day inc
Derpy can be Dawn. Her colours do fit it slightly.
Speaking of, inb4 Ditzy Doo :D

Twilight's little "sorry" is Flutter-tier adorable.
RainBroDash loves the plot more
This is the episode where everypony learns the value of middle management.
Ditsy Doo didn't fly the wrong way, all the other birds did
10ReticentSmolder god damn you I wish you were wrong
Why no team leader vest for Pinkie?
indeeed
Dear Princess Celestia
because Pinkie worked alone at first
GIGA CLOUD BREAKER!!!
Clouds
How do they work?
Pinkie Pie's part of the weather team, and Dash is the weather team leader.
RBD is the weather team leader, pinkie works under her as a lake scorer
She is part of the weather-team, so Dash has the vest.
Ahh
Huzzah for herdmind.
@Robotpinkie the ice melter's actually isn't a real job. They just let Pinkie do that so she doesn't mess anything :P
Clearly Pinkie should be the leader. :3
And also for ditzy recolors.
I remember that theory, ValtheJean, and love it :D
And then next episode it's fall again.
lol
I find it weird how they turn winter in to spring... or more like summer in a day
EEEYUP
Screw canon, I'm gonna sew a team leader vest for Pinkie
is it still WWU, or next episode
7its magic!
/me has jelly for brains apparently for not shipping anypony yet.
That's why they fail so often. They set their goals too hi9gh.
*high
end of WWU
That vest is hideous
10ReticentSmolder you're losing your touch
So who is the ground team leader?
6>no team leader vest for Pinkie, Rarity, or Fluttershy
6TF?
Spike? Spike?! SPIIIIKKEEEEE

Change clothes in a flash of light? Twilight is a magical girl?

That poor RainBro.

We had a hearty laugh when he fell asleep on the ice... well, we're not laughing now.
6What you gonna do about it bro?
Spike must have narcolepsy.
It's okay RBD
Switch Rarity with Rainbow Dash and it's true
And then he drowned
yay...
RainBroDash, have some shipping
There's no such thing as the worst pony/ponies.
Except for Daisy
10I'm gonna hide here and make sure I don't do anything else wrong :23

Finally, someone has it right. Thank you DragonRage.

It's like saying "Timmy is my worst child."

Fuck Timmy, Timmy can go to hell

Wtf it's JUST this network!

One hoof bad, two hooves good.
Way to go.
Lips flapping in the wind
So are hoofsies awesome?
/me He was tired after a long day's work, and desperately wanted some sleep, but Twilight had been insistent that she join him in something tonight, whatever that may be.
You rock, woohoo
Yay was ruined for me thanks to troll youtube's top rated comments
lol, every single book falls down
Fluttershy's cheering was super effective
Do you even need to ask, Nittany? :3
woohoo.
No.
RainBroDash should I keep going?
I know, HeavyMetal. Youtube commenters are why we can't have nice things.
10ReticentSmolder if you wish, I am reading it :3 (and saving it)
And please, Smolder. RainBro gets the final say of course, but...
10although >twilight :P
/me is disappointed in himself for not yet finishing Pizza Dough
Who's streaming?
lol no, it's not really correct usage either way since I have not demonstrated logically that hoofsies are awesome.
6I am, Pegacorn
yeah, I know, but I've already shipped you with Rainbow Dash and having two RBD's is a little confusing

Celestia is the Sun, the Alicorn is just an avatar. She's too busy fusing hydrogen to worry about ponies.
Mary Sue? Nobody in that show is a Mary Sue.
I like how Elky is tempting fate, power to you bro :P
You saved our lives, we are eternally grateful /lgms
And adults, of course.
10also: I need to read a good SpitfirexDash after this.
I mean she'd be as bad as Ebony Darkness Dementia Raven Way if she was a Mary Sue
6LIES. I should go to Derpy.
read: "With a Spark"
6*It
And to be fair, rainbow hair is often a symptom of Mary Sue-ness. Doesn't mean RBD is one, just sayin'.
Nopony is a Mary Sue. I know the accusations are usually just people joking, but it still bugs me when that trope gets thrown around all willy nilly.
@ingaesia he has, he wasn't a fan
Celestia also has it, too.
I learned how fabulous I am
hahaha
Rarity is old enough to know better.
...We now need a SirSprinkles x Derpy fic.
He needs to go to Derpy
Threesome on the sun. Love it.
PLANS.
But not the best NIGHT ever.
10ingaesia. I have done... All my happiness was lost ;_; That fic was amazing
RainBroDash I liked the twist in it
implied threesome
FREEENNNNNSSSS
And with that, I believe I will take my leave. You guys won't need me for Across the Universe, will you?
6inb4 we're all high
@rainbrodash, sorry for the waiting, the problem is "connection cancelled"
And then they went back to Spitfire's apartment and fucked. The end.
10ingaesia it was amazing. Never have I enjoyed a twist so much.
Across the Universe time!

Yay!

How does this movie compare to Enter the Void?
I'll return for that
6Yeah, Ghosties, at least be here in 2 hours so we can do that.

Is this a Beatles musical? Is that what this is???
/me Background: the movie follows events preceding and during the conflict in Vietnam
10Maxaminus_1 practically, yup
:O
/me this is a beatles inspired musical
I'm freaking terrified that my stream will buffer for two hours at any given moment
fuuuuuu- the moment i posted it it happened
10HeavyMetalPony XD
/me Other than backstory, this song is useless imo, just shows her and her boyfriend before he ships off
See you in a bit Ghosties
MFW waiting for 7 PM, fall asleep and miss that too.
/me Jude, played by Jim Sturgess, is supposed to mirror the life of John Lennon
ohai dari
*sigh to youtube: did the title appear yet? or is it still helter skelter
oh hey dari
@HeavyMetalPony we're past it :(
Hey everyone.
Hey.
wait, was Evil Dead 3 less than 90 minutes long?
Hey Dari. Sorry about the sleep thing D:
ohai dari
it's still so early...
Jude works on a shipyard in...Leeds I think
I think IMBd said 87
^but I may have forgotten
12brbs
lol, the streaming don't work, so i'm watching it on "megavideo"
XD
wiki says 81-96, depending on the cut
OOHHHH! I GET IT!
gl with that Gnorri, say hi at the 75 minute mark :P
still, that's darn short
WHy do they all have British accents?
if you have any questions or are confused speak up
DragonRage's brain is full of accent now. I can't even think straight.
It was average length when it was released, Elky. Now movies get laughed out of the room if they aren't at least 120 minutes >.>
@HeavyMetalPony this is in Leeds
10HeavyMetalPony... it's in britain
6...I got lost trying to find my computer. XD
:trollface:
O.o
didn't know it changed litke that
These are photos of his estranged father he never knew
6Because... *cigarette*
I don't either, Elky. Since society is getting more and more "I want it now now now," you'd think movies would get SHORTER.
7and I
I guess people want more movie for their buck
yup
ReticentSmolder: Hey I'm only 10 seconds behind. Pretty decent for a blind start
Good theory. Either that or directors just want to prove their balls are bigger than others'.
I like long movies
im stuck with "Connection times out" over and over
Some pretty epic Bollywood movies out there. :3
well, the best movies are often the long ones
/me nice, anywho, Jude is stowing away on one of the cargo vessels he worked on, *illegally* this comes in later
6What's the problem, Ignaesia?
Good point, RobotPinkie. Maybe it has to do with more cultural mixing, and Hollywood learning from Bollywood.
I keep getting "Connection Timed Out" tried multiple browsers/refreshes/restarted
6Suddenly lesbians.
7did you try clearing your cache?
where?
hmm not that... brb
Also I'm partial to big budget Bollywood movies
6For the stream, Ignaesia?
Still, the best movies are the ones you don't really have to pay attention to because they have awesome music
/me Right now the war seems pretty distant and unimportant compared to the high-school shenanigans. Prudence is a girl who has a crush on another girl in high school and ends up running away from home after receiving a fierce beating, either from her old boyfriend or from her parents.
Agreed, HeavyMetal. Funny how that doesn't work *as* well with visuals.
prudence is a real name?
What song is it now?
@Elky yes
I wanna hold your hand
/me The Cavernous club seen in the UK side of the alternating vignettes at the opening of the film is the 'New' Cavern Club in Liverpool. The original Cavern Club where the where The Beatles played in the 60s was closed in 1973 and the site became a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's underground railway.
ok good
sounds old fashioned, like Fürchtegott or something
Connection Timed Out again
Deeeear Furchtegott...
Slowly...the characters assemble
6Ignaesia, sent you a PM
lolol I'd pick Rang De Basanti as the A-movie if I ever win the lottery, but I think someone might murder me if I do that. :P
I have a feeling this movie won't make any sense until half way through
it can't be worse than spider's web
Wouldn't be the first timme someone's trolled with their movie selection ;)

i can't tell if t he cameraman is on acid or not
IT'LL BE A GAS
Whoa, this place really emptied...
Fucking bowling. How does that work?
/me The light-hearted and more jovial scenes depict a psychadelic influence reminiscent of the pervasion of drugs in early 70's and late 60's culture.
lol, Windows Movie Maker Rainbow
Still a fun scene though :)
orgies...gas...eh I don't really like mixing those two up
Will there be afterhow? y'know vids n' stuff?
/me MOVIE TRIVIA: this chick edition: Sadie, with her fiery red hair and passionate temper, is a reference to Janis Joplin. Sadie is even seen drinking directly from a Jack Daniels bottle during her downward spiral, an action that Janis did regularly with Southern Comfort. Even Janis' throaty singing voice is used by Sadie in the movie.
WhatPayne because there are problems with the stream, many can't connect to veemi

10ReticentSmolder haha really?
Normally, I hate musicals, but I actually dig the singing in this.
I hope it's TNG, if there is. :P
I don't know. We'd need the Necronomicon for that, HeavyMetal, not to mention someone who could remember the spells written there. And nopony can.
I guess because it isn't something like a Disney cartoon.
or Enterprise... most underrated trek ever.
Also, agreed, Nittany, except without the part about hating musicals. XD
why would anyone hate musicals?
I do.
They're stupid.
I love musicals and I love Disney cartoons, but the latter are bad examples of the former. If that makes sense.
/me In the beginning of "Come Together", the man in the station is playing air guitar with his left hand strumming. Probably a reference to Paul McCartney being left-handed.
if veemi is down, how am i still watching the movie o.O
i thought zoot suits were a 1920s style?
Hellfire disproves your point

not counting download timez :P
my friend was torturing me with nyan cat on the phone D:

/me Jude doesn't have to worry about the draft because he is in the US illegally, much like John Lennon
A pony's gotta do what a pony's gotta do.
atleast the nearest 2 tables
03Not exactly sure what the speeds are though, need to ask them but I've asked people and they say it's better
(which is why saturday stream is best stream)
/me Jude's life progression is similar to John Lennon's. As John Lennon did, Jude first lived in Liverpool then soon after that moved to New York City to work as an artist like Lennon. Jude then encounters trouble with the law and is deported (Lennon was arrested as well, but an attempt to deport him failed).
^At least you have a continuous stream Elky

No! Come out!
12good luck
Yeah, thanks Reticent I appreciate the inchat synopsis
/me According to Julie Taymor she used 30 songs of The Beatles as a basis for the script that covers events from 1963 to 1969, but in the film those 6 years are compressed into two years.
which is retarded
AND THEN THEY FUCKED
6nope
In 60s all love=sexy time
03Like to rip people off I think

Dumb internet.

That seems like an accurate reflection of the modern animation industry, since any shows worth working for are animated in either Canada (FIM) or France these days ;___;
Did they instate the draft in Vietnam?

/me A scene when Prudence locks herself in the closet and has to be serenaded out by the other cast members - is a reference to a real occurrence in 1968 at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India where The Beatles, Mia Farrow, Donovan, and others were studying.
/me 12gives nightmare ;3

Is Skylands a HML fanboy
:o
/me Some scenes are derived from actual 1960s events, such as the violent student protest at Columbia University. The actual explosion at a New York townhouse was the work of the Weather Underground and took place at 18 West 11th Street in Greenwich Village; a photograph of the actual house appears in the movie.
Damn.My keyboard can't use the number key.
/me cries in a corner
Motherfucker.

Personally, I have no opinion of U2.

Or they are in The Matrix. Just the 1960s version.
10Latias shaped pancakes
/me chucks a red fairy at LL
/me "Because" is sung by exactly nine actors - a reference to the way The Beatles recorded the song - the 3-part harmony vocal performance among John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison is overdubbed three times to make nine voices in all.
Pantias
03Half the people in the US don't care about ANYTHING xD

A lot of us figure "WE don't care, fix things", and nothing gets fixed. And then we complain some more, even though we really don't know what's to be fixed because no one can be bothered trying to read up on shit
Making out...underwater...in front of green screen.

Beautiful movie is beautiful!
War. War never changes.
11WHAT IIIIS IT GOOD FOR?

11Aboslutely NOTHING!
how would they get the hair right otherwise?
DragonRage fallout reference?
This movie would rock in 3D, Heavy.
Eeyup.

Some rules need changed.
Oh yea, I agree, they were under water. And in front of a green screen.

true
But Sky
lol SirSprinkles
I'm sure I've got something wrong there.
but does a green screen even work underwater?
:<
Sure
11the hospital scene was my favorite scene.
Yes, Elky
@Elky if placed behind a tank
12I've been flattened, left, caked...WHAT NAO?!
yes, i saw it on a Harry Potter doc
<speaking from 2 years of professional compositing experience>
wouldn't movement in the water disturb it?
naw
just a green-screened tank
Ignorance is bliss... SAME THING.
okay then
chromakey only cares about color
or that
I'ma just sit in the corner.
I'd offer cookies
6Elky, the movement of the water would just result in an actual water look for the greenscreen anyway... Oo
so what do you guys think of it so far?
Also used in 300, The Eye 2, and many other movies.
but I'm afraid what the reaction would be o-o
I'd offer muffins

Me with a server in London: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1409817171.png

You don't get distortion when you're fully immersed in water. Unless there are temperature gradients.
Fucking die

High School was a popularity contest that I was happy ended.
At least it wasn't Captain Morgan. Or Smirnoff.
Mmmm chocolate chips
I'm having southern comfort right now, it's too sweet for me
I don't know if this is a bad thing, but so far my favorite part of the movie tribute to The Beatles is the tribute to Jimmi Hendrix
Ewwwww envy and paib

with my luck I'll probably be a trubbish or something
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 5Poliwrath.
108 evil spirits that have been killed by you
yes, 7/10 sounds about right
I got like 2 days left on my download
!pokemon
Pattyrick, you are a 8Caterpie.
how do you kill a spirit? o_o
Yay
I've been downloading this file like all fucking week.
also
I hate you Cait.
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 12 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
i fucking hait you so much.
IDK
....
Hate.
DAMN YOUR NAME
You use the GHOST command
... I can hear thunder outside. I don't know whether to feel awesome about this, or worried.
6I love Hey Jude.
Only because you could really make this film with any band just by changing some details
d'oh
fail
Feel awesome.
Indeed =\
depends on where you live
12;-;
But I'm a severe weather freak.
!Kosoveon
Where I live, it doesn't rain much. It makes me miss Wisconsin.
FAIL
I /want/ to live in Tornado Alley for the tornadoes.
where I live it rains all the time
LOL
Or at least closer to it.
epic timing!
!skylands
;3
timing
XD
:P
Why doesn't Hollywood just make band movies like this from now On? It's much better than freaking remakes, and I'd probably see them all
and in winter, we have unholy amounts of snow
It sounds heavenly there, Elky.
/me yaaaaaaaaaaawns
brb, let me kill my other nickname and grab something to finish drawing
/me sits on Ray

02oww...
or wetter
OR stormier.
I used to love the rain until my apartment flooded one year.
you're mean to Ray D:
I would love to just live near the desert for example
I fixed my script.
:P
/me WINS!
bad Kosoveon, go in the time out corner :<
*clap clap*
Oh trust me, deserts are overrated.
Not everyone likes bad weather.
inb4 27x22 shipfic
:P
DragonRage: I kinda liked living near deserts
The Mojave's got some interesting plantlife, but that's about it.
yeah me sitting on something an eighth of my size is so mean
I just did 27x22 fic,
speak for yourself :(
Lawl
27 x 22 fuck and make 594.
i like the rain, it's a good excuse for my solitude

Max and Jude's Excellent Adventure: British Edition, MrPoniator

I thought there wouldn't be any movies anymore, and kinda left this open

12the TENTACLES OF DOOM
Told you it was a turd with cables connected to it.
me neither
just waiting til they get shown on synchtube or bmn gets the job done too
and the fact the octopus can jump
just seals the deal
/me 12prefers Mr. G&Ws Keyblade :3
Chances are if I liek the song I'll like the PMV, that's what I look for
ray can agree with me here
I never did master that thing
/me prefers his torch move
02SO HOT
wow XDXDXD

02other one's*
12as opposed to the enemy got burned?
And hi Combustiblelemons. You wouldn't believe what you just missed. Unless you saw it last night
Then again if you really wanted to do Beatles justice the film owuld have to be 7 hours
I saw it
back
Thank god :D
Funniest night ever
12yay lateness :D
Was Friday's better than today's
And I had to miss it because Veemi hated me last night >.>
02However
Veemi has exploded today.
yeah. also streams not working for me T_T
The site's down. :/
Veemi was frozen today
ahh ok
02The G&W's FS is easy to deal with
This is what you missed last night: http://images.memegenerator.net/instances/500x/9125550.jpg
6btw, guys, the Home page has been updated with next weeks lineup.
Curious because to me it's working just fine...
aw, didn't work
02You only need how to "border play"
orly
That was fast. Good job, Sprinkles.
one problem
cool, will check
12doesn't always work
6I did it earlier, Tuba.
12edge guarding
12:B
you're BOUND to be able to kill someone with that move :>
6I had the code written out for it since yesterday.
So you did it even faster. :O
especially since the octopus can jump
02Edge guarding can be dealed with Block abuse
that just fascinates you, doesn't it, Kos?
that an octopus can jump
Octillery can jump and you ignore it =(
The storm's getting closer, I think. Just heard a loud thundercrack.
<3
oooh. I love storms too
what if I suddenly became an Octillery?
holy crap
hello?
I'm at dinner, right
and guess who I saw
storms are cool
hi?
ohai ziltoid
All I'm getting is "internet explorer cannot display the webpage" for the video.
Peter Griffin?
no
wait what
your mom ?
Hugh Hefner?
my high school band director
Also, is it just me, or does this PMV make Applejack seem a lot more badass than she usually is on the show?
my stream is derped
Do you live in the US DragonRage?
LOL
I was like :O
Spongebob?
yes we all have it. streams crashed
Yeah.
implying Applejack isn't always badass
6Veewave, it's because veemi is having an issue.
Aw well, still no luck with stream. Better luck next week.
OMG SPONGEBOB!!
West coast, on the edge of the Mojave.
oh ok
meh AJ is boring.
6All of veemi is down.
/me dies thinking of Krabby Patties
Squidward?
Tamagotchi!
NO U
12o-o
well I can jump but you never acknowledge it :(
Pierce Brosnin?
so ther
e
aw, I love AJ
Then how come some people are watching?
I can jump too, Kos!
but I don't feel like saying hi o.o
...and all ponies
AJ is alright
She's nice and all but she's boring.
12Danny D:
some people didn't refesh their streams
12how wude

you are too, Kos :>
California.
Or are you looking at the weather radar?
The way she rounded up those vicious bunnies
/me 12made sure of tha-nvm
that was badass
/me 12shot
LL, well
6Why it's working for them, I have no clue.
I'm sitting with my window open.
I'm shy
6But all of veemi is down.
I'm still a medium-kid
surely you can't understand
Medium-rare?
strange.
12I can
I understand what you mean, drf
They didn't develop the ponie's personalities based on their elements much past the pilot.
OK, anyway I guess I'll go then. Can't wait for Inception...and tomatoes
12only too well .-.
I can sometimes be a lil' shy IRL
04XD
I don't think another pony can claim to have saved all of ponyville from being trampled y cows
04LL
inb4 but that's no excuse
04You so funny
Okay, the storm is definitely closer. I can hear the rain. Oh gods, that rain...
Which I thought was a little unfortunate.
04hi
well RD is still loyal to her friends I guess max
Well I've refreshed the stream quite recently, but not the page.
6So... rules revision time guys?
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 7 minutes
Yep
I want to see the storm on radar.
loyalty is an easy one though
so what now?
But I would really like to see Rarity's element explored.
loyal to her friends? Dragonshy begs to differ
Calfornia has a ton of doppler radars.
brb
screw friends, she got the ticket
She's still badass.
Any problems with this? no? ok
I guess for terrain purposes.

Bits of it.
I was here for the first movie
02something
02.-.

I was here for some of last night. Internet crapped out twice though, so I missed most of both movies and of Winter Wrap Up.
but the f-word version?
http://memegenerator.net/instance/9125550
best part
02lolno
I was here for everything but didn't watch Across the Universe.
oh
02just ghey
I underestimated the movie.
02.-.
Nope. I was here, but I might as well not have been. When the stream was working, the chat wasn't, and vice versa... it was awful.
it didn't kick me though o.o
02Which is weeeird how it kicked me.
02and didn't kick you ._.
I didn't want to watch across the universe
o.o
well
Lol that's DCD isn't it.
12it hates Ray :o
so i didn't :D
yes it is
was it any good?
Yeah, epic pre-show
if you put an s after it...
it was good lemons
it's like saying pissed, you won't get kicked :P
02lolno.
but by itself you will
02oh I see
02So yeah
04Blah Dib is so stupid
lol I made that one robotpinkie
All right, DragonRage went and googled weather maps and such.

how hard is it to just not swear, seriously >_>

most important thing we need to add is a "the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit and make changes to the rules as the situation may warrant" disclaimer
how hard is it not to talk suggestively seriously >_>
Swearing is boring
04XD
02But I didn't :<
04Not hard at all
Oh hey, that's actually in the list. Didn't even see it.

LOL is an abbreviation
12I'm not :D

so I capitalize it

Laughing loud
12:B
o.o

12don't insult the adverb ;-;
12you'll hurt its feelings...
well
loudly is proper grammar
Arrow Aero? Is that not a coincidence too how they sound similar, Kos?
laughing loud isn't
hmmm
well LL if you want I'll try not to insult the baby carrots in the fridge by not eating them :<
Quiet chat is quiet.

stupid saganaki
In 3D.
Ah.
My radar program can do 3D radar images.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.

Ray
So glad lotto night is Saturday next week. :D See you all there.
where are you in europe anyways?
are you levaing tuba?
The program I used for that image is called GR2 Analyst.
If you're wondering.
Ciao, Tuba.
02Because Europe needs some lulz. and because my father was transfered .-.
Cya.

02And chaos. never forget chaos
bai tuba

6...where's Ghosties, dari, and RainBro?
I'm here.

02oh lol.
yo
>implying I'm ever not
02In the Netherlands
02Because it's closer to HEEELLL :D
6FUKKEN MAGIC
/me wishes he could go there ._.
XD
where in the netherlands? holland?
Can't wait till next friday- Inception :D
i probably won't be able to make any friday showings for quite a while, but oh well, saturdays are more chill anyway
02Netherlands is the Country, Holland is like a state or something; not really sure .-.
02and yes. I'm at holland
I still think inception is kind of a poor choice
...
Holland is just another name for NL
they're synonyms
6Well that's just like, your opinion, pony.
02.____________________________________. .------------------------------.
My friend says watch it twice to understand it
well the movie's good
back
So I can thanks to this :D
/me googles it
but it's like choosing pirates of the carribean or something
Well, yeah, because everyone seems to miss a kind of major plot point.
did you know that the Netherlands are the biggest coffee drinkers on the planet?
holland is the western part of the NL
they average in 5 cups a person per day
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland
12I thought Holland was no longer the name for it
Yeah, fridays are out for me too, I need to start spending friday nights with my stupid little drinking buddies again.
6Elky... you do realize that that statement just was one of the dumbest things I've ever herd, don't you?
02It isn't the same thing drf
12hmm I see
I'm good at picking up plots to stories. Best I don't read the chat whilst I watch it thouhj
I thought that was Seattle...
I didn't really have a good movie to compare it to
/me runs
For me it's more that studies are starting up again. :3
12I always thought they were the same, but that Holland was the old name for it
6"People will pick movies they think are good for the good movie of the week"
same Arti
no, people will pick movies everybody's already seen
Still, nothing can possible suck as badly as spider's web.
The B-movies are also good!
now brb dinner
6EEEEEEEEEEEENOPE
02lol, where is Shiny where you need him
6This week is proof of that, Elky.
Elky, as opposed to Aladdin and Mulan?
Spider's web robotpinkie... D:
6NOPONY had even HERD of Across the Universe.
^
I mean attack of the killer tomatoes? Pure gold.
tbh, I've seen neither of those
02he should be nickalerted when someone says coffe--
I'm waiting for the day that Scootaloo rips off that handle and starts practicing her kickflips.
02well he's not here. xD
I've heard of Across the Universe. :/
sprinkles: which is why I prefer weeks like this one
Pink Pony!
We need more skater chicks.
timing
XDDD
I love this skit.
in any case
best pony :3
This should actually be a thing.
6Well, Elky, it's called mixing it up.
I haven't heard of it but sounds like a good b movie
Elky, you've never seen either of those? How?!
but yeah, you're right, it is just my opinion, man
My movie choice is going to be My Little Pony: The Movie
6We'd get to the big movies at some point anyway.
U mad viewers?
lol
D: oh god
lets discuss what things we definitely want to change for the rules so i can put it in the rough draft
!
No idea what spider's web is... I guess it's good that I missed it?
Yes Dari
Eh, why not, dari?
7eeeyup
my childhood was largely disney-free
RobotPinkie: No, you missed out. :(
Dari, I will find something that even you won't be able to stand.
6i.e. End of Summer Special being LotR. Stuff like that will eventually be shown.
Come at me, bro!
We're gonna have to see it one of these days.
I have a buddy who refuses to watch G4 but swears that he loved MLP the movie when he was a kid.
aw :(
be happy you missed it robotpinkie
ohai dari
Hey.
:3
I'd rather read 100 badfics than see that again
Is that so...?
you should definitely watch it robot
Missing Spider's Web is pretty much the best way to see it.
...>_>
oh god it stars Stephen Baldwin? that sounds hilarious
/me yanws again
it's forming character
Why all the Spider's Web hate?
I love that film.
02I'm geeeetting sleeepy
...
Wait.
Combustiblelemons, I'm compelled to write those 100 fics and make them utterly horrible
02But I refuse to sleeeeeep
Haseo, here's something for you to laugh at: http://speedtest.net/result/1409809525.png
6Need something about spoilers, IMO
Sorry, wrong movie.
I think.
I don't know.
Dari.
Are you thinking Charlotte's Web?
02Because sleep is for the weeeeak
EeeeeeeeeeeeNOPE.
Because that's awesome.
ill put in something about being respectful
I restreamed Spider's Web because I missed it.
spider's web is a bad ripoff
What would your perfect movie / episode lineup be?
and specifically mention spoilering
I don't want to see anything to do with pigs after that episode
Was an awesome film. :P
no it's not
*film
02a Wild Country has appeared :O
I've seen better.
it means your body doesn't want you to melt
:(
wild country fled
A lot better.
I've seen way better, but it still feels me with rage
6Something about links other than image links
you gained: 0 EXP
7err..
At least I'll be here for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, that's gonna be awesome.
02:<
ah yes
It feels you, eh?
definitely
Yes. Seen. But do you have that kind of speed yourself?
Feels me in the wrong way that is.
7never seen it
spider web is fucking garbage anyone that says otherwise is lock in the coco
I'm hoping hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for the next A film.
8-Bit Winter Wrap Up.
The question is do I care to.
spider's web was more enjoyable than the room
Perfect credits song.
/me sits on Kosveon's head and go--
02No.
so there's that
the room was awesome
02I won't >-<
o-o
go--
02Must not sleep.
Elky: What a story Mark.
I'd like to see Aliens for A movie, Krull for B movie, Applebuck season, and Suited for Success.
also something about caps locks.. imho it's annoying
lol so you have had The Room for BMN?
what time is it there XD
6Ziltoid, that's just like, your opinion, pony.
6Robot, yes.
I dunno, the chat really improved Spider's Web, but The Room... not so much
Now that I'm genuinely sad to have missed.
suited for success is on next week
sweet
max: exactly my episode choices
I picked best night ever for the other pony ep :D
6Just a sec, I'll pull up the list of past movie nights.
underrated imo.
I will feel incredibly sad at what I've missed
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9305622/tmp/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%203.56.13%20PM.png
This torrent is full of lame.
Jumping Lyra <3
sprinkles: could you put the list on the site?
you were there for DCD's show though weren't you?
ill mention it in the respect section
lololol.
omg I just saw next weeks movie lineup. I love you guys.
sometimes I wonder what movies went together, so it'd be handy
Elky: What, a sort of history section?
021am
but thats borderline unenforceable
To show what we've streamed before.
yup
6I plan to at some point.
what was the best BMN?
great
Meh, we could pretty much just paste the tables?
With all the films.
not that bad
Oh okay, not too much I'm all that sad to have missed. :P
some people here stay up till 4AM ;;P
6I was going to do the tables with all the films, actually.
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 8 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
Death stalker, definitely sad to have missed
Aw I'm sad I missed the Super Mario Bros movie
for example, what a mive went with Deathstalker 2?
6I already know what I'm going to do for it.
02I could
The big lebowski now that is agreat movie
02buuuut'
MFW I should have kept all the tables, but just replaced them.
6Up! was with DS2
02I woke up at 5am
oh
D: dari
6I kept them all.
02thank you timezones
also true
Oh, nice.
6I keep records of EVERYTHING.
and well, Disney movies
so that definitely is up there for best movie night
Man, we saw Up! and DS2 near the start of July?
Best movie night was Evil Dead 2.
The movie that went with Deathstalker II was Up
It feels like it was just last week. =/
I didn't really like Up.
Other than the PILLS!
PIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
I dunno, next one sounds like it'll be awesome
I wonder if DCD is going to get sprinkles to do an embarassing pre-show in revenge one day....
03o..o
:|
Lawl.
mfw I can barely read anything
haha
6He'd have to have reason for revenge, first.
I don't think Sprinkles has a webcam?
6He was supposed to stream yesterday, not me.
yes, definitely Up/DS2
also, lol at eqd
Also, my scripts works fine now, suck it viewers.
ahh ok
7Luna won
6inb4 script fails
"I'll get my revenge, and Deathstalker two."
Lawl.
Oh god these ponies
6Dari, you should change the color
they drive me to socks
To?
I kinda saw that coming really.
6Like, the background color of it.
max: the only clever line in the entire movie
6Make it all light blue on dark blue or something.
light blue.

Anyhow, I've got a fanfic to write and some Dragon Nest to play, so ciao everyone.

I want to watch a 60s spiderman episode for a preshow thing one day :P
We watched a spiderman ep once, but I guess a newer one?
yeah a newer one :/
2722
^ no
:P
2722?
and I calculated how fast Spiderman's webs were
12New RBD Post: 2722
XD
lol
great post RBD
Pattyrick, I can show you the wi-fi adapter I have when I get home in like 10 minutes

*applauds RBD*
sweet song
Ok
bah, the original is better
Going to watch newest Torchwood episode.
BBL
marginally better
yay Torchwood!
Gonna put on some brony music I think
have fun, dari
see ya dari
Also.. where's the rest of the team?
6No idea.
6Well, the only one that's not really here is Ghosties.
I found pokemon leafgreen when I was looking under my bed today :D
6dari and RainBro are in the mane chat.
Dari is afk now
rbd is here
he's watching Torchwood
sorry I was making some crumpets
6Well, is there even really anything we still need to cover?
Yay!
6For the moment anyway?
uh, okay...
/me 10is eating toasted crumpets. So he wins.
6Until the rough draft is written up...
all I need is my Pokemon Emerald, though
I found that too :D
well the thing I'd like to focus on mostly is wording
02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
Crumpets? Chat just turned 1/5th more British
Emerald has a stronger story but it takes forever to skip all the talking...
I don't want to know what other stuff is hidden under your bed...
6Well, that can be worked out after the draft is written.
10robotpinkie. Shall I get a pot of tea on the stove?
Myeah, I guess that's true
Whut movie, I wonder...?
Awesome stuff elky. awesome stuff.
I say.
10Sucker Punch
Way ahead of you, RainBroDash
quite.
10RobotPinkie <3
Earl Grey
Bai :)
10I was thinking breakfast tea
oh yes could I have some scones too?
10but earl grey will do
I might not be British, but I'm a bit of a britophile or something :>
I actually thought that was a good movie
despite all the negative reviews
03oooo.oooo
Ohai I'm british.
mfw all I know about how Brits speak I learned from Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged Series
really good soundtrack too
exactly, so i don't really have much to contribute beforehand
:3
/me wonders how it is
ehh close enough elky
I should go to London more often, it's not really too expensive nowadays.
probably not the best guide
It looked ok, but not the kind of thing I'd go and watch by myself
7RobotPinkie: is from?
I'm from Sweden
if that was the question
Only been to london 2 times in my life and I live in britain >.>
embarrassing.
im almost done eating, so ill get to work on it shortly
7Yes that was the question
why would it be cheaper robot?
Sneas y u so WV
well it is definitely a dumb movie
but I'm half dutch, so that makes up for it :3
03wut
03XD
but the good kind of dumb, not the transformers 2 kind of dumb
I'm wondering that too elky... Everything here is just rising in price
xD
Flying is cheaper now than when I last went.
It's been a loooooong time
hm
Ya'll talking about where you're from?
oh ok
all the new Transformers movies = explosions
/me 7is a half dutchy aswell
7US/NL interesting combo :)
Oooh
that and really, really, really dumb humor
Next you'll be telling me you live in PA
which was really got me to not like TF2 aside everything else
7Nah I live in the Netherlands now,but got raised in the USA
I live in PA.
Oh cool
I mean the first had its moments but it was never to the same extent
8>mfw 2 of the mods live in PA
Most of my family lives in the Netherlands, so
yeah, the humor is only worthy of live-audience style loling
I'm starting to think it's the center of the Internet. A lot of people I know online live in PA.
My girlfriend's from PA, I go there kind of a lot
7PA?
Pennsylvania.
8Pennsylvania
7ah
8I live in Ohio myself
I guessed that.
yup
6>mfw the about us page randomly changed font style
Sad thing: I've met zero people I've known online that live in PA.
Well guys
6>mfw I didn't even touch it
wat
6>mfw I'm not bothering to fix it since it's basically fine
and girl...
I had to look it up
especially for SirSprinkles
Let me apologize for not being here like I said I would. But, I spent some time with my mom
:P
my USB adapter is like my iPod and iPad: it uses the cool air around it to cool instead of having airflow inside of it
6It's cool.
I felt like it was good for me and her
no cool/moving air around it = it gets pretty hot
6We haven't even had the rough draft written up yet.
But whatever you guys did for the rules, can you just give me a run down?
Oh o.o
So, no revisions yet?
not so much yet
I love going to the US, but that's kind of obvious.
/me yawns some more
6We're adding in stuff about spoilers, and links other than image links.
02z-z
I've been pondering a ponychan thread seeing if there are bronies that go to Penn State, but I'm thinking that the average age of a chan memeber is too low for many college kids to be on there (no offense).
I want to go to the US one day.
/me is sleepy, too
7I'm thinking about returning to the US at some point
US is ok. Don't mind our govt.
Ah, alright
I want to live in the US one day, it seems cliche, but still
The snack aisle in US food stores....
...still have no idea why Veemi isn't loading
Veemi is down
/me wonders what Pokemon Ray is so as to avoid crushing him incase I decide to sit on him
not sure what keeps the US together sometimes...
it's a miracle the stream is still up
Corporations.
That's all I can think of.
I asked that once and someone said "rednecks and patriotism"
Veemi's down?
02Small dragon, not a pokemon :P
Really?
Money.
yep
what money?
02like 30cm, so be carefull .-.
6And the "the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit and make changes to the rules as the situation may warrant" disclaimer
Did the movie finish before it went down?
Lol.
6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
but when you actually meet people there, politics don't matter so much.
6Went down at the start of the movie.
How far in was it?
we were able to keep broadcasting
The money we give to people that won't give it back.
in britain politics are top of the line.
6Nopony noticed until the end of the movie, really.
7I just drag my boyfriend with me :P
/me sits on R- he means tucks Ray into bed :3
you gave europe 3 trillion dollars after WW2
Well people that joined were unable to view
Most surreal experience in the US: Sitting at some cheap fast food joint talking to a couple of war veterans about tobacco.
/me tries to get up
at least that's what my pm's were telling me

Ray
think how much 3 trillion is in nowadays money.
6Yeah.
do you WANT crow's feet ;-;
A way to fix our debt crisis: Raise taxes, especially for the rich.
50% tax on the rich here in britain.
politics? in my chat?
02NUUUU
si.
I thought prayer was the only solution :>
I don't know what the rich tax rate is in the US.
6>mfw my list of BronyState duties has become fawkhuge

It could be flat.

Britain's falling apart too.

Force politicians to choose favorite pony before taking office.
Elect the brony party!
All problems solved!

Who would be head of the brony party?
I like to think that most problems will eventually solve themselves
Brony Party: 20% cooler than the rest of the government.
Well, yeah, I think as a general trend the world is getting better and better
stuff like racism will slowly weed itself out
Maybe greed will start weeding itself out of the US.
6He left early July.
Remove the economic boom/bust ups and downs, and we're having a steady upward trend.
I see
not gonna happen tiger
6He should be back next week I think.
Actually...
>_>
I completely forgot about Bristle
Well, the govt.
6Not exactly hard to do...
greed and racism are human nature they will never go away
^
but most younger people, except for a few nutjobs, aren't racist at all nowadays
6>mfw font is randomly fixed
Meanwhile, in britain...
so over the next few generations, the problem should become marginal

they certainly do in our country.
Question, did we have an interview with SoiPony?
There will always be problems, but that doesn't mean things don't get better
6I don't believe we ever did.
well, they do here too, but more covert
...really?
mostly people try to hide it behind a concern about human rights
Here too, of course. I'm just happy to see it get weaker and weaker.
03God, I have such a painful headache right now
Human rights cause problems over here
/me turns into a block of ice

it's okay, I was singing along in my mind too

6What? I actually DO all of that shit.
xD
I thought it was just starting
lol
Some of it could be in PR though

That's what you missed on friday
Is it that important to people?
6Some people like to know who's going to check the email if they try to contact us.
Myeah I wonder that too, mibbit kinda blows, I guess
I mean some images work perfectly fine

6I forgot to do Hipster's, I'm actually adding it in now.
I like that you added in the "Technical Support" bit for dari
6Yeah.
How do i join another channel again?
6I added that in for dari and myself so ponies ask people that are... likely to know.
Oreos = FTW
Aww, that sucks D=

7What Elky said
Thanks Elky
7and RobotPinkie
Yeah, I certainly am not tech savvy
and sathi
Speaking of which, did dari give you the list or whatever?
7hihi ^^
you gotta shaaaaaaaaare
He brought up the lotto earlier in Skype and I told him to direct his queries to you
7gotta care
Arguing's not the way.
it's the right thing to do
6Dari did not contact me about anything that I know of.
Hey, come out and play!
lol
.....Shut up Ralph.
and by play, I mean, uh...
Oh well, I told him to tell you about the Notepad++ thing
You gotta keep 'em separated.
7yes?
Whatever that is
6>Notepad++
As far as I recall he said he had a script ready
6I need to redownload Notepad++ on my comp.
That's probably what it was
I should delete all those pony songs sometime
wat?
6I'm running all of my coding off regular Notepad... bleh.
I should get a pony background soon...
NEVER
luckily, the phase when I absolutely had to have those on my mp3 player is over
anyone know any good backgrounds?
now the internet suffices
6Oo The About Us page is doing the stupid font change thing again.
[4:27:33 PM] Dari: So it'll just PM you with the list, one name on each line, and you can paste it into Notepad++ and use replace to get rid of my name at the start of each line.
6I literally didn't change a single line of coding.
That's what it was
I love the dark side of the rainbow background :3
INTENET,HELL YEA!
;_; herdmind
I was copying that
:D
Whoops.
*INTERNET
ha pink floyd ftw
XD
Nice
linky pinkie?
look yourself: http://www.equestriadaily.com/search/label/Wallpaper
Pattyrick , do you need a keyboard, too ?
Really?
joking, I don't use pony wallpapers, so no idea
That's my wallpaper right now
6That's simple enough.
6I'll need to get Notepad++ up and running again.
I like these though: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/megasweet-wallpaper-pack.html
6And we'll still have the problem of what happens if Dari isn't here, but that's just a couple extra steps.
So Sprinkles, now that you have a source of income, how does it feel to not be so hungry anymore?
Boot Nittany_Tiger and Nittany_Tiger__ off please.
6>implying I have money yet.
Those are just dead connections.
Or they may time themselves out.
Fucking wireless.
I can see why people like them but I need something more awesome.
...
6I don't get my paycheck until ...next Sunday.
6Comes out on Friday, but I won't be able to get there until Sunday.
04mew
04o-o
Aw, the one I linked wasn't awesome? :3
6But I get free meals when working over 6 hours... which is most days.
it was and it now is my background :D
Yay!
Right, so, you must not be too hungry anymore
I was talking about elky's backgrounds
400 spins on Ponyspin
6>400
6That it?
8-BIT CRUSADERS YAY!
wish I knew who made it, kinda want to thank her/him
6Not really.
ponyspin?
I'll raise you 1 hour nonstop equestria girls
Nittany_Tiger1 goes.
04Pattyrick
6I'm a little hungry right now, but there's food at home.
ponyspin.com
04Make your move
im scared
nsfw
Oh, how'd that spicy chinese food go through you?
7@Combustiblelemons I have an epic wallpaper for you
14Haha that sounds so weird
nothing wrong with it
question:
/me looks on in interest at sathi
Thanks for warning me. I completely forgot about meatspin.com
7-opening imgur hang on-
PONYspin.com, not meatspin
04XD
who is going to be our "go-to complaints person"?
what's ponyspin?
600 spins
don't go there
14I think he's busy so
as in, if someone has complaints about the rules or mod conduct or whatever
I know, but ponyspin is just meatspin with ponys, right?
ponyspin is not bad
I GOT RICKROLL'ED!
worse nittany
lol
7http://i.imgur.com/k6OGv.jpg
7there it is
no it's just a CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SPINNING AROUND
dammit stream, Y U RICKROLL ME
i'd be happy to do it if you guys dont have any objections
A complaint channel, perhaps? So that way the workload isn't all on just one person?
:D streams working
03<Pattyrick> Really? <- yep
what is NSFW about that
@ghosties it should be a new mod :trololo:
aww, you could've let them find out themselves...
sorrry.
well, heres the thing
03but yeah, speaking of keyboards I have like tons of keyboards and mice that my mom wants me to get rid of if you need any XD
...no, that'd be asking for problems, I guess
not sure whether to use that as my background...
just kidding
yeah
I'm just joking
the links at the bottom are presumably nsfw
you have to see it for yourself
6Honestly I'd have no issue with it being anypony other than the newer mods.
see if it's safe for work or not yourself
Is ponyspin.com NSFW or not?
i think we should have maybe 2 people
7no Luna fan? :(
see for yourself
6I was thinking 3.
14No one wants a mouse LOL
Because I'm not a fan of porn.
14they stink
fine with me
oops
that handle the complaints
well, technically it's not porn...
I have that background saved already, Sathi
See. For. Yourself.
me, sprinkles and ghosties?
any objections?
6You sir are in my brain.
03A computer mouse LOL
7good RobotPinkie
Meh luna gets 5 seconds in the whole series and yet she's #1 background pony for some reason
My only problem is if what happens yesterday happens again
anyone tell me her appeal?
7I have others aswell
7hang on
I do like Luna
so, explicitly, what's the position that you're putting those 3 people in?
May: Yeah, that's why most of the OSes that don't implode still have CLIs and almost nothing but. :P
well, at least she had a speaking part
I don't mind her :/
like, give me your wording for now
so does derpy.
6That's why there's 3 of us, Ghosties. They can just go to one of the others.
7[URL=http://imgur.com/Gt93V][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Gt93V.jpg[/IMG][/URL]
7grr
you spin me right around right around baby like a record baby right around right around
not as much as the mane 6, but eh, I also like Cheerilee, so
14I know drf
7fail
not really
any issues they have that are legitimate will be fully discussed in the mod channel though
14I'm just being an idiot heh
Luna had the guts to go up against Celestia.THAT,my friends,is awesome.
7http://i.imgur.com/Gt93V.jpg
6Of course, Hipster.
she says muffins
octavia?
that's like saying that every pny who sang in wwu had a speaking part
I guess I'll just have to accept that people won't come to me with their complaint if it's about me
go to ponyspin.
6lol @ Sathi attempting to use forum/imageboard code
Luna gets more airtime next season. Hope she doesn't go evil again.
yeah
It will change your life.
but like i said, we will discuss it here
7I failed
6It just won't happen, Ghosties.
we've had this discussion :P people are scared to complain to someone with power about said person
7clicked the wrong url in imgur
7:D
6It's not the way people work.
Then yeah, I'm on board
I hope that evil luna is not canon
PEOPLE, Y U SO NOT WORK RIGHT
hmm... face team rocket boss or heal pokemon and come though the maze to get to him again...
I don't care, like, at all.
Anyways, format?
6*COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE MUSIC*
I'm just sad we probably won't see Photo Finish again
10XD
People just PM either myself, Hip, or Sprinks if they have a complaint?
my stream dieded
lol
900 spins :D
ADD A TEASPOON OF GODZILLA.
who is photo finish based off?
And then take it up in the mod channel?
6Pretty much.
ugh, you are sick partysmores
ze germans
Everyone says lady gaga.
6Eyup.
Got it
Elky, see for yourself if it's NSFW or not.
wat?
Is Lady Gaga german?
Anna Wintour
Don't accuse me of being a pervert if you don't know.
thats the one elky
I was there partysmores
Hip, how's the draft coming?
I know the site
yeees 1,000 spins
and?
still sick
6>mfw shuffle is biased and we just listened to the EXACT SAME SONG TWICE
PONYSPIN.COM. It's a Cutie Mark Crusader. SPINNING AROUND. It's a joke, no NSFW content in it.
just about done
oh you
*tries to remember which SPB this is*
FIND SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE IN A CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SPINNING AROUND.
Alright
1,200 spins
cupcakes!
brb,gotta eat
oh btw sprinkles
I think you should add this to the about page
Pinkie > all
6?
I love SPB. It's like being in the 90s again.
if you get a chance, can you run a trip explorer for me to find a "leverage" trip?
Nice
it's rather important
6>implying it's not already on my tripcode explorer list
oh, so you're already looking?
nice
6Eyup.
6I look for everything.
XD
6I'm looking for a tripcode that says tripcode.
Sathi, what were you talking about?
how long till pinkie destroys the 4th wall...
did you ever see that !Ponychan trip that one time?
the complaint department ;)
you mean to the "duties" section?
She hasn't already?
Oh, that sounds good
04XD
Just update the About Us to include the mods that handle complaints
:D owl city fluttershies parody!
yes or as a special part of the about page
What is this song called?
I <3 this one
ugh that song
UMAD elky
YES I MAD
http://mibpaste.com/awfgA4
I've been unable to find this in YT...
good?
SOOOOOO MAD
you found it now?
without the double numbers of course -.-
I'd like to...
Relax, have some pony
type in owl city fireflies parody it's on the first page.
just look for filly fluttershy :)
Looks good
What about number of warnings/kicks per offense?
Yes! Thank you Combustiblelemons.
hey
:D
postshow?
wb gummy
not really
Now my collection is complete... for now.
8bit wrap up :D
Looks good to me
more like postplaylist
6That's in there, Ghosties.
you wold know believe your eyes
man I messed it up
6One warning for any given thing.
6Repeat that one thing, get kicked.
6Looks good to me, btw.
12New Dari Bot Post: 2272
Really? Just one warning?
Oooh, that's a new one
lol so apparently i has teamspeak nao XD
I've only read 2722 before
./random
was there even a postshow?
Don't you think it may get lost amongst the postings of around 200 people?
2 really
6I see no reason to have to nor want to remind people.
I agree with Hip
2 warnings, then kick
6Kicks are essentially just warning anyway.
06I need to stop being shy about my voice I guess
nope
ADMIRE THE SPIRIT BOMB!
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ebiaEG_clZQ/TjSQtIGQGsI/AAAAAAAAJhA/QtIrePLT5ow/s1600/rainbowdash_zetto_genki_dama_by_riokenng3-d425lf9.jpg
kick is a warning
1 warning then kick
06I also need a better mic because voice_loopback 1 tells me it's terrible
/me flop
That's what Sprinkles is saying if I'm not mistaken
I just think one warning isn't fair
6Eyup.
I dont even kno whats going on anymore
it serves as 2 warnings before the real consequences, a ban
needs moar rasenshuriken
Wonder what dash looks like when she's super saiyan
It can easily got lost in the sea of posts when there's so many posts going on
But how many people see a kick as a warning?
6If it gets buried, that just means they weren't paying attention to the mods, which they should be doing.
super saiyan pinkie?
she's already super saiyan
golden rainbow mane and tail.
and imo if they are willfully disregarding the warning and doing it anyway, they deserve a ban anyway
unless pinkamena
golden rainbow mane?
so much anyway...
14As I was saying
14I don't understand
wat.
ignore my terrible grammar
14Drake wins my battle
I just don't think it's fair to the users is all.
(Rainbow Dash super saiyan)
6We'll just start including "This is your second warning. To rejoin the chat click here: #bronystate " in the kick
how is it not fair?
14And he loses to Drake
/me OTL
I think 2 warnings is the optimum amount of warnings followed by a kick
14Well
sirsprinkles: i would rather say "final warning"
14Even then
6Yeah, final warning.
I can see how things get lost in chat, it happens all the time
14You said you wouldn't have won for those crits
6I have no problem with two then a kick about SOME things.
6But some things need only one warning.
frankly I think we have been too lenient with warnings as it is
Then let's re work that
14Hey Espeon
('Cause super saiyans ALWAYS have golden hair)
14I got muted again
I have no idea what super saiyan dash would look like. Too awesome to comprehend?
14:'D
For the rule 34 stuff, it deserves an insta ban
No doubt
04XD
6We really have, Hipster.
Eeyuo
*eeyup
6Colors we have a script set up that's two warnings and then a kick, so that's good.
im not inclined to warn a person 3 times before i ban them
Colors are good, yeah
14But I wanna battle too D:
If Rainbow Dash were a Super Saiyan, Dragon Ball Z would be 20% cooler.
04May
04PM, now.
I still think it depends
14Okay
>implying Rainbow Dash could be any more awesome
at that point they are a continual problem and obviously have no intention of following the rules
Last is the image/video links
^
And also trolling
6Hey, guys, guess what: "Finally, the mod staff reserves the right to enforce these rules as they see fit"
That bothers me
problem is here though
Eeyup
i want a concrete framework set up for these
6As do I.
That's like saying the mods don't adhere to any actual rule and can just do whatever the hell they want
worst misspell of pinkie pie ever
Doesn't bother me.
DAMN YOU INTERIOR_GUMMY!
so people arent going to bitch and complain saying "X mod is too strict"
6We need that disclaimer, Ghosties.
It makes it seem like the rules are just a formality
lol
That's the way it's supposed to be, you see that appened to almost all rules, Ghosties.
6I've had SO many people say "such mod is too strict, such mod is too lenient"
I have diabeetus
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zyV8S1_cXXo/TjSQlYUzZnI/AAAAAAAAJgA/Uk0lO3Lrf74/s1600/baby_octavia_in_socks_by_kelliek94-d423ohe.png
6The disclaimer gets rid of that problem.
Then what if we get some viewer that actually has read the rules and gets upset because one mod doesn't do what the rules say because they were just "enforcing the rule as they saw fit?" That last little fine print pretty much negates the other rules
D'awwww
meh 5/10 on the cute scale.
6...then he'd complain to one of us.
And then we'd handle the problem? Why not nip it now?
Why wait until it actually happens?
ghosties, heres the thing
6Because removing that line creates more problems than it solves.
/me opens a chest Zelda-style and finds the Octavia in socks picture in it,lifts it over his head and screams "I FOUND THE DIABEETUS!"
we NEED that disclaimer in there
it gives us the flexibility to deal with problems as they arise
XD
Man, what's 1 on your cute scale?
Let me get this straight, that disclaimer in there is more of a deterrent than anything else, am I correct?
6That way people can't pull loopholes on us
1 being lowest?
6Yes, Ghosties.
hell, i had bjornfot straight up tell me he was thinking about ban evading using a proxy
I guess nothing not-cute would even be rated?
yeah.
when i told him no he said "well, there's nothing in the rules that says I can't"
Then I'm with you
6And I straight up told him if he did I'd permaban his entire area.
thats why we need it
Kick-Ass is Kick-Ass.'Nuff said.
not more than 3/10
for situations like that
what's with the meme of ponies with socks?
SirSprinkles: YFW he'd probably get an onion router and keep coming back forever.
Till we'd banned every area in the world.
That still sounds so shady to me. I can understand needing it, but it just seems so...unfair to the other users. I get it's for the troublesome pests...
No idea, really
um nothing
Kick-Ass is my favorite movie of all time.
it's... just there?
It's cute though :3
Ghosties, most rules have a statement like that appended to the end.
>mfw it takes us less time to ban a person than it does for them to evade
YFW it doesn't with an onion router.
I know, I'm well aware that most rules have that at the bottom. Doesn't mean I like it
it really is very important for us to have it in there
Yeah, I know
I just hope none of us abuse it
Including myself
Okay, time for bed.
Night y'all
That disclaimer will be a testament to our professionalism, if you ask me
Cya.
night elky
night elky
bye elky
if any of the mods are abusing the rules, which hasnt been the case so far, they are going to be de-modded
simple as that
06PSA time to everyone
06http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Thumb+if+it+made+you+smile+D+D_86d9eb_2420837.jpg
06You're welcome
/me flops out of sight
Like I said, it'll be a testament to our professionalism
bye Elky
I don't expect it to happen, but I've come to expect anything
Looking at the past movies I missed here, I missed some good ones.
Granted, I wasn't a brony until June.
ok, so are there any changes we need to make to these rules?
suddenly derpy
What about trolling
Yes, its working again.
MFW mods troll more than anyone else
I was itching for tornadoes in May like every year.
the section on being respectful
I was one in april
:D
i'm a rather new brony
I had watch clips of the show by May.
I'm an old-ish brony
>3.	Respect other users at all times. Do not personally attack other viewers or act rudely
So if anyone just outright goes "YOU'RE ALL FAGGOTS, MY LITTLE PONY IS FOR FAGS" that's pretty much an insta kick yeah?
I've only been a brony like... 1-2 months?
And the slumber party one, which was not a good one to start with.
To be honest, I'd just ban outright for that.
i'd ban straight up for that
I think the moonbase alpha ponies pulled in a lot of bronies.
Only started really getting into the community very recently
Because they clearly have nothing worth contributing to conversation.
cuz they're obviously trolls
But we've had that before, and those guys have been kicked. Don't know if they haven't been banned later, but I've seen them only be kicked
the community is the best part of it.
And THEN if they come back in and do it again, they're banned
and trolls arent going to read the rules anyway
aeiou
Well, I'd ban outright for it.
In fact, that's how I did my first night moderating
Anyway, not all mods react the same way to different things.
Well, without ponies, no community :3
i only converted at like the end of june
i banned outright when we had that mini-raid a few weeks ago
I suppose so
For example I'd like insta-ban for racism.
Likewise.
Not everyon agrees with me.
everyone*
Hooked since the first episode
You'd insta ban for disliking Rainbow Dash, dari -_-
I didn't really convert. I just slowly slipped in.
my first movie night was july 15
but yeah, lots of awesome creative people in the community
oooh, dari, good thinking
I didn't need any more convincing that ponies were awesome after ep 1.
im going to add that to the respect section
This seems to be tying into the disclaimer at the bottom.
I guess I didn't need much after the first episode I watched, wasn't the first though
the music is beautiful from bronies
Oh wait. My tipping point was "ponies that can control the weather!"
I am glad we've decided to have complaint persons, and thank god we have the mod chat
Someone linked me to episode 6, and I watched it :P
:D love this song
>implying disliking RD is as serious as racism. :P
Because dari's right, every mod uses his own judging and discretion
Or implying that I'd think that anyway.
That was from the same episode.
I heard you banned SoiPony for saying something about RD
A joke, of course, but still XD
Then I jumped to Episode 1 and watched the whole of season 1 in a week.
lol
Haha, I probably did.
04'Daww thanks Espy :P
Trollbans for all!
6>a week
in a day.
Oh lord
my tipping point was probably "it was under e". odd, i know
LIKE A BOSS
6I watched all the episodes that were out at the time in a day.
lol wat
lol some people have to work and study :P
6Granted, there were only ten. XD
Someone linked a channel I was in to "Green Isn't Your Color" before Photo Finish says "The Magicks!"
what happens late night in BMN stays late night in BMN :P
Then I proceeded to watch the rest of it.
It was ok.
there were about 24 out when I joined
BMN Caffeine Edition madness I expect.
DA MAGIKZ.
/me pulls up an episode list.
Damn, I've only modded 11 BMNs
the season was over when i discovered ponies
wait which ep number was philomena in?
6More than me. XD
22?
True
6Also...
I had to wait for that one so there was only 21 episodes on youtube when I joined
6>implying that 11 isn't almost all of them
Again, true
I can't believe it's only been...that
It seems so small in comparison to the actual streams
6I've modded 8. And the postshow for week 4.
added to rule #3: Do not post anything that is needlessly offensive based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc…
Good
Myeah, season was over when I discovered it too
A Bird in a Hoof.
6Sounds good to me.
Ep 22.
also, im going to add a rule about starting drama
yay
AVAST FLUTTERSHY'S ASS TIME!
/me has the list.
yay
6YES.
the "cupcakes" rule
:D yay
Don't do it?
Whee
yay
oh oops, I mean yay
HIT US WITH IT, HIP
basically
6Mention Cupcakes, get banned : D
/me bored
granted that the title throws you off how epic this song is
1 minute while i work out the wording
wut
the question is, do we explicitly mention cupcakes in the rule?
No, no no
Now THAT'S oppressive :D
6Kidding, obviously.
Haha, the title is what keeps me from linking people to it :P
it might as well be 'mention cupcakes get banned' :P
i could just scream
i PM everyone who mentions it and make sure that they understand that it's not right and why
Do we kick if they try to stir up drama, or warn and then kick?
6Depends on the severity of it.
*squeak*
That's another thing, I think PMing the drama starting is a good idea
It singles them out
what i dont remeber this part
So it was like half of 20, then 8, then a clip of Flutterguy (that was good), then I started watching them from 1 - 26.
6>implying that everypony reads the PMs without having to be told they were sent one.
Well, obviously we have to tell them "You have a PM"
new remix?
PM is way better than going 'DONT TALK ABOUT CUPCAKES' no offense to silverscreen but i cringed hard when he said that
>implying I don't send notices instead of PMs
a less popular avast applejacks ass thrown into it I hear
Unless we put up something about the PMs in the rules
I try really hard to make sure that I diffuse the problem without letting anyone know about the problem existing XD
6Yeah, notices are typically better.
Notice?
um
:P
I never use those : /
They appear in the same window as normal chat.
can you send me one dari?
ty
I'll remember that, infinitely much better than PM
...did he get it?
cause i dont have to say 'hjsgd check your PM'
Oh, sweet
6Yeah, channel notice works.
who was the first brony?
yay
6...my ad is for gmail. XD
some guy who watched G1 ponies?
Oh, so that worked?
Adam was the first brony
Yeah.
The message didn't come up for me : /
Does it not show up to the sender?
6It doesn't.
But sprinkles, you saw it?
oh wait, there's no mythology here?
adam west! :P
6Eyup.
:w
:3*
o hi doggy
6Cheese was the first brony.
I'm guessing several guys watched the first episode at the same time.
added: 6.	Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please do not bring up controversial topics. This would be including, but not limited to, discussions about politics, religion, “Cupcakes”, furries, and other topics not mentioned here.
ohai dari
: /
Do we have to watch the room again guys?
So, leave out anything that's not fun
God, that feels so limiting
i would love to watch the room, never got to
I know, I know, we need it
it seems that way until the entire chat turns into a giant shitstorm about Cupcakes
What is with dari's red name?
I'd like viewers to think that we're not completely stripping them of their right to free speech
I missed it, but I've seen it already, so...
YOU'RE TEARING ME APART RED NAME!
i'm a pinkie pie fan and still, rd is my favorite
*in the gala
WHAT?
just in the gala song
posting here is a privilege, not a right
Still... :(
Look, the way how I see is that as long as the discussion remains civil, it shouldn't be looked down upon
RD is just BEST at everything.
pinkie is my favorite overall
I have a real problem with that
what dari said
Honestly
You have to see it, it will make your life at least 20% cooler.
trixie didn't beat her.
The one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie :(
>implying discussions on those topics ever stays civil
>implying it always happens
Because it rarely does
And it's almost always for Cupcakes
But, even then, it gets defused when we remind them to not stir up shit
7TS is best end of discussion :P
thats why we need that rule
No dari! Bad mod!
to keep people from stirring shit up
trixie has to be the most overrated character though
That's restrictive though
I don't like the rule
That's way too limiting
8 1. RD 2. TS
8dealwithit.jpg
Sethistio, Y U NO HATE TRIXIE
Trixie is not supposed to have a fanbase,yet she does.
1. RD 2. Cheerilee.
nobody likes gilda though
That rule implies that people don't have the common decency to be civil
1. RD 2. Derpy
except her ex, rainbow dash
It's insulting
I agree with Ghosties on this one. I think we should just put leave the drama at the door
Gilda is like Francis from L4D,so she's awesome.
because in most cases they dont
not really
and it only takes one or 2 people to turn the entire goddamn chat into a shitstorm
We still shouldn't put the banhammer down on someone for saying that they're a furry
LOL, this vidwo.
video*
7 1 TS 2 RD nuff said
Well,i thought so.
10Scratch > RD > All
Top comment is awesome:
"Push 4 4 4 5 6 4 5﻿ 6 4 for the imperial march song."
y u all hatin' on mah ponies
lol
7all ponies equal!
and im not going to have the entire event get ruined because chat derailed into a discussion of cupcakes that got everyone angry
Pony communism!
1. Mane 6 2. Cheerilee
When has that ever happened?
if people want to discuss those things, they can go to /dis/
Cheerilee is awesome.
There's always been someone there to tell them to stop
its nearly happened 4 times that i can think of right off hand
She needs an episode in Season 2
cheerilee sounds like sarah palin
But it's always been quelled
RainBro: Vinyl Scratch is your favourite pony? :o
until myself or another mod put a stop to it
I always thought Gilda was like Francis from L4D ever since i first hear her talk.
twice with cupcakes, once with furries and once with religion
It's never gotten to the point that the entire chat got in a fucking uproar about it
please don't ruin it for me gummy
and i intend to keep it that way
10dari: yup
thats why the rule is in there
*heard
Wut
I do not accept that rule
As long as she doesn't THINK like Palin, I'm fine with that.
^
I refuse
what dari said
10Dari, what?
It's not fair to anyone
Not even us
problem?
RD not favourite pony: BANBANBANBNABNABNBBNAABNBABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBABNABANBANBABNABANBANBANBABANBANBANBBNABANBANBAN
I has problem.
but seriously, 1. pinkie 2. rarity 3. spike 4. fluttershy 5. rainbow dash
10LOL
If people can't be themselves without us pushing down on them, then that's a shit rule
7oye
7you forgot someone
spike is not a pony!
he is a character
if they want to talk about cupcakes, they can go somewhere else or PM or whatever
and he's attracted to fillies
I guess I'll accept that... He does have taste.
but in 2 of those cases i had to tell people to stop discussing the topics or i would start handing out bans
Then re word the rule, don't make it sound so oppressive
in mustaches
i fail to see how it is oppressive
It literally sounds like people can't talk about religion or politics
Evil Spike is best Spike
im telling people not to start drama
MWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
*Moustache twiddle*
I wonder if we'll play requests.
Yeah, villain Spike was awesome
Read the rule
Please leave all drama at the door. This is intended to be a fun and inclusive event, so please do not bring up controversial topics. This would be including, but not limited to, discussions about politics, religion, “Cupcakes”, furries, and other topics not mentioned here.
It clearly states "no talking about politics or religion
That's completely fucked up
thats why I said leave the drama at the door
We're not allowing people to talk
agreed dari
I dunno, who needs to talk about religion and politics anyway?
because those topics ALWAYS start drama
A lot of places have rules agaisnt bringing up those topics.
EVERY
no love for owlicious
owlwlicious isn't in any of the other episodes though >.>

owlowiscious is a dick

We shouldn't have to tell them DON'T TALK ABOUT RELIGION, DON'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS, WE'LL BAN YOU OTHERWISE
interior_gummy: How dare you.
no
Is he even going to be back?
That's so goddamn oppressive
All he ever does is be helpful. ;_;
^
And he gets so much hate for it.
owliscious just wants to help man
Owlicious has a stupid name.
That's not fair
he just helps twilight at night ;)
Just tell them not to start drama
that's all
gross
!pokemon
If you can change it to that, then I'm fine
._.
wat
Kosoveon, you are a 4Azumarill.
functionally its going to be the exact same thing
how would that even...
Even on Ponychan, people talked about it
that's what she said in the episode
>supposed to be fun
6I say take the "politics, religion" out.
>people talk about politics and religion
I'm not gonna think about that.
>andnoasinglefunwashadthatday.jpg
not*
6Some political discussions and religious discussions are good.
And Ponychan can be pretty restricted, honestly
Thank you, Sprinkles
the stream oh dear
I've never seen a good one.
Not on the internet.
NEVER.
6If it turns to shit, we warn them.
if people are bringing up those topics, im going to ask them to stop
Hipster, just leave out the "NO TALKING ABOUT RELIGION AND POLITICS" bit and I'm good
anyway have some awesome cheerilee.

!pokemon
;o
I'm fine with leaving that bit in.
Actually, just say "don't start drama"
it worked :D
>Politics and religion. INSTANT SHIT STORM EVERYWHERE
Don't purposefully cause a shit storm to happen
Haha
i dont know if you guys have been to the /dis/ board, but not a single thread on any of those topics doesnt involve a shitstorm
that is why I like cheerilee.
she's teaching the colts and fillies about /b/?
and thats even when rule #1 on the board sticky is "don't be a dick"
You can't bring up politics and religion without a shitstorm. It's not possible.
best teacher ever
People on Ponychan are fucking masochists. They wanted a /dis/ board and yet people argue all the time on there from what you just told me
Also she's a teacher, how's that not awesome?
they do
Ghosties: It isn't possible on the internet.
But it's not right to tell people that they can't talk about something
Politics and religion ALWAYS end badly.
It's
no
t
right
Usually as little as after the 2nd comment.
not every teacher is awesome :S
Why not?
Well, no...
And besides, the only people that ever do are pretty much trolls
Is this some "freedom of speech" thing?
Yes
But I refuse to think of Cheerilee as a bad teacher
It doesn't exist on the internet. Viewers can DEAL WITH IT.
arnold was a teacher in a movie once
also, 80s cheerilee is epic.
:)
I'm telling you, I can't accept the rule as is
What is it?
If we'll play requests!
6I guess leave it in. After all, we'll enforce them as we see fit.
Oh, I don't know. The whole of veemi is down.
So I can't stream, I don't know if Sprinkles is still streaming.
I can't load the stream.
I can
the streams working for me
i started this as an event for people to have fun and watch movies with other bronies, not as a chatroom for them to talk about divisive topics and have everyone get pissed
6>requests
It's working for me too.
i'd like to see my video request :D
ill be damned if thats what i let it become
6>it's almost 9
03eo.o
well as mods we can cut discussions down if they turn into shitstorms?
oh god
>if
I'mma post a request!
haha
it becomes much harder once theyre in progress though
MUCH harder
03!pokemon
6No you're not~
As has been said there is not a SINGLE discussion on the internet that's not turned into a shitstorm when it's about politics and religion.
03No I'm not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYN_VNYKz7g&feature=channel_video_title
not gonna lie this song is sick
well if people don't listen we can use the warning system as we discussed before... it's situational

Hrm
03Cool, Unowns FTW XD
Nice
!pokemon
!pokemon
Look, I'm well aware that this thing started because we wanted the fans to have something to do. And I like all the other rules, because I think they belong, but telling people that they can't talk about something without you guys automatically assuming it's gonna become a massive shit storm is just unfair to the users. It's insulting
ooh
YEAH
as in disturbed?
no
And it makes it sound like we don't have any kind of faith in them and that they're fucking nothing
disturbed is bad
shooby doo! shoo shoo ba do!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqsHbKgtwM
Sorry, but I really don't care if they think it's unfair.
im a bloody golden duck .x.
i have NEVER seen ANY discussion on any of those topics i mentioned stay civil
^
mah request
We've always contained them
ALWAYS
^that.
and this rule is going to keep it that way
6>is not taking requests
I mad now.
That's fine.
go back in to to where you didn't get celebi using that script :(

>we cant contain it anymore

>users get pissed
6I was planning on it, but I'm frankly a bit too busy to review requests before airing them.
We always have done something
Man, I need a blank pony to use for making dresses. :(
We never NOT do anything
>they leave and dont and come back
night lemons
We have to do nothing if we don't have that in the rules.
Because they're allowed to talk about it.
/me walks off into the sunset
7goodnight Combustiblelemons
bye lemons
What the fuck are you talking about? I think the mods have the appropriate judgement to know when someone's causing trouble
next week, hopefully
Otherwise, that there sounds like you don't believe we have the professionalism to step in
Causing trouble?
They have to be trying.
You're undermining our abilities
They just have to mention one thing someone disagrees with.
Then EPIC SHITSTORM within 30 seconds of that comment.
Especially on instant messengers.
I can't believe you guys seriously think that this rule is actually going to stop it
Even on God damn forums they don't take long to form.
it gives us the ability to stop it before it gets out of hand
WE ALWAYS HAVE STOPPED IT
FUCK
6It won't stop it, it - DAMMIT HIPSTER
XD Sprinkles.
It won't -stop- it per se, but we have a solid anchor to kick/ban from
other viewers see the negative repercussions
I'm stepping away from the chat, I need to clear my head before I say something I'll regret
->profit

Someone pick a SP game for me to start. I have list on my Steam page, and I'm in the group.
lol
what i dont want to happen is what is happening on ponychan right now
MFW what's happening on ponychan at any point in time is not what you want to happen somewhere else
people saying they're getting banned for having unpopular opinions
03hm
03anyone here know anything good/bad about Thermaltake power supplies?
6>all of what dari said
6ponychan = DRAMA
^
exactly
We don't want any discussions period. Opinions are mentioned during discussion
I prefer forums to imageboards anyway.
^
brb restart
i dont know what sp means
kk Kos
MFW we should have a forum.
single player generally
and i see it happen on /meta/ ALL the time
10Size of your Pocket? :P
oh ok
10as in, gameboy advance SP
10:3
a forum? why a forum?
6>we should have a forum
people say OMG I GOT BANNED BECAUSE THE MODS DONT LIKE MY OPINIONS
6Wouldn't be hard to do, but wouldn't get much traffic atm.
6And would be fairly pointless.
Meh, a forum would help keep dedicated viewers.
Holy crap! Someone else bought Shattered Horizon?!
with this it would give us a concrete rule to point to for those complaints
I'm gonna go for today, just working on my WWU vests right now anyway
And would give viewers a place to discuss BMN things in a place where their comments won't just disappear.
And would give them somewhere to place complaints/suggestions, etc.
6*shrug*
goodbye robotpinkie
g'night guys
6I could easily get one set up.
also toystory
bye RobotPinkie
YOU GOT A FRIEND IN ME.AWESOME.
You could put it on the new domain.
I'd play more MP if my attention span wasn't poor and my aim wasn't poor.
With a forum we could also keep track of our modstuff / discussions
6This is true.
Daxton, you will forever be associated with NewDCD mental break downs in my mind.
And a lot of modern FPSs have unlocks that give skilled and long-time players an advantage over you.
or discuss future plans / ideas
Like unbalancing damage perks.
Have you played Witcher? I don't see any time listed on that one.
I'll accept it
But I sure as fuck don't like it
No.
ghosties did you read the reasons i gave after you left?
I've been meaning to play Mass Effect after Star Wars: Dark Forces, but that game is getting dull.
6...he logged off, Hipster.
oh
Aladin?
As I said, I'll accept but I don't fucking don't care for it
And a bit harder than I want.
let me explain, because i do think its important
But more of the fact that it's getting dull.
oh ballsacks
wb Kos
You can explain it all you want, but it seriously sounds like some fucking Minority Report bullshit
thanks
i see it on ponychan ALL the time
I just rmemebered that I did have to miss both shows after all
Exactly, and I fucking hate that shit
nb and hi Obsi
stop for a minute
I hate that this one little slice of the internet is supposedly a safe haven from harm
hihi
*np
let me finish before you interrupt
I really, really wish DICE would make their MP games friendlier to people like me.
Go right ahead
I can't get into them because most of the games consist of me losing to higher-level opponents.
like i said, on ponychan i see it happen where people say "OMG YOU BANNED ME BECAUSE I HAD AN UNPOPULAR OPINION, YOU GUYS ARE TYRANTS"
So I can't enjoy the game on account of frustration.
BF2 was the same way. Too hard to get into.
Goodnight everypony!
with this rule in place, we make it clear that they are being told to stop NOT because of their opinions, but because of the topic
Night.
Night
Are you done?
I need a fucking tutorial on BC2.
pocahontas?
yes
Sounds like it
I can stream a game or two of me playing.
I am now convincing MtChar's friends he has ate a bug.
And you can tell me what I'm doing wrong.
12New Dari Bot Post: 2722
The way how you wrote the rule sounds like you're restraining the members of the chat because you feel like no one can be civil at all without it becoming a goddamn shit storm. And dari pretty much said that's what he believes, so with that, if you keep the rule as it is, I want you to publicly address the main chat, mute the channel, and tell them
That the reason we have the rule is because we don't have faith in the regular viewer and that we don't think they can behave apporpriately
Honestly, you shouldn't have to take a class or watch YT videos just to play an MP game.
Tell them
It's goddamn insulting
hey bronies, surprised so many people are still on
Yeah.
hello
im telling you right now, its not possible
Nittany_tiger, what stream will it be on if you do?
just got back from Cowboys and Aliens
again
Then tell them
the majority of users probably can
How was it?
Either Tinychat or UStream.
Tell them that we don't think they can be civil without guidance
Saw that yesterday.
lol
7so much EQD posts suddenly :o
but all it takes is 2 assholes to start shit to completely fuck up the whole chat and ruin the event for everyone
I was broadcasting Orbiter from Tinychat one night.
that wonderbolts dash doesn't look that great
You're assuming that every person in the chat thinks and behaves that way, and they don't
I haven't finished that run.
I removed the lin so the script would make the mistake again BTW.

Now this is DEFINITALLY Mulan
no, i just said they dont
To see if RBD could find the mistake I made in the script.
but let me tell you what happens
Then why are we singling out everyone
oooooooooooooooooh
Since he seems to find it SOOO funny that I made a mistake.
person A voices an unpopular opinion
>_>
:P
12:D
Why do we have to put down everyone else for a couple of assholes
person B disagrees with said opinion
You're not answering my question
flame war starts
Oh god
everyone gets sucked in
Good luck with that.
You'll need it
Like I said, I'll accept it. But I don't like it

how was sucker punch, sky?
I don't agree with it
Yes.
I actually have artistic skill.
WB Skylands
6Ghosties, it's because all it takes is one person that can't be civil.
And I have a plan to do it.
6The majority of our viewers are civil.
10It was pretty good
I wish I could synch my comp to you guys, I'm about to watch Silent Hill :D
Then why punish ALL
6But we will eventually get ones that are not.
10Dad walked away from it in 30 minutes though XD
A) Download plugin to handle texture files.
B) Modify them in GIMP.
Hah
10The action was kinda fake
7but you can...
10Needs more rated R action
6Because people get heated up by arguments easily, and are not easily calmed.
Hah :p
our job is to keep this event fun and inclusive for everyone
C) Put modified files into correct folder. Make sure the file name of the new texture matches that of the old file.
B+) Create a copy of the old texture.
not to make sure everyone can talk about whatever they please
but I can?
10action scenes, that is
Wouldn't you need the code to the website?
And to be a mod?
To broadcast here?

yeah what he said
thats why we would kick people out for posting racist stuff or R34
