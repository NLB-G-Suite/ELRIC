opinions everywhere matter.
I like the mods
^
Is it pony?
Yes.
Everypony is entitled to have an opinion... but only mine is correct.
Then YES
I'd like that :P
MOds are the coolest
0Well either opinions matter or they don't
0It depends on the subject, not the source
Hmmm
I would never doubt it
12hi
0HACK
I was wondering where to find the HGSS soundtrack
it's the thought that counts

Possibly.
0Kung Pow *trollface*
0WeeeOOHweeOOOWeeeOOOWeeOOO
....
Is tentacolino a good kun-fu movie?

Its kinda soothing
Denied_Existence: Well I have a few already lined up but I can see about getting you in. Have a skype?
I assume stream requests are over since Epic Sax Spike is playing.

I just found this line in a fic
Lunar Republic ftw.
I can't sstop laughing
despite being kind of a twat, Angel was very perceptive
90s flashy leather jacket if within budget
Some shipfic on FF.net
It's called the pit for a reason.
0I hate when fics make angel an asshole
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053844/6/The_Desire_of_the_Loneliest_Heritage
They didn't, but THAT LINE.
Fly me to the moon plz
0lol
That makes it 100x worse.
/me Can you write in a text document "Good Night Everypony!" and put it on the top half of spike??!
0Kind of like Campfire Secrets
*me
ಠ_ಠ
0>>
I'm judging the story, not you
I read all fanfiction including clop. Although the aforementioned is actually usually hilarious.
0Yeah, other than that odd line, it's a great fic
0lol
Uhh
A sleepover at there place
0Scrumpty Apple something
Campfire Secrets was epic.

YES MA'AM!

I go to sleep at 7-8AM
Now that's scary.
Ponies ponies ponies
07o3o
I have one rule about sleep:
0SWAG
well if its among the mane 6
after 6, fuck it, and stay up all the next day
Not if you do it right.
Not for me books, if I can get 2-4 hours it makes a HUGE difference
I'm addicted to the night now
I say fuck the day
Coffee makes a huge difference.
I don't use caffine
I use Luna
I inject it into my veins
0It's all down to execution @ sex and swearing in ponyfic
caffine, not ponies.
^
I wish I could inject ponies.
=D
well if its about OC ponies i dun mind but i can't really imagine the mane 6
inb4 news calls ponies a drug
Rarity + Twilight
fox news maybe
RD + everything
03and this is on the History chanenl
fox news is hilarious
0DashiePie works well, imo
HE NEVER RESPONDED.
Ok is the mod still here?
Or is this on auto loop?
I like the idea of SpikexPP, personally.
Any1 read the Story where the Mane 6 go to alt universe wit gender switched versions
too asexual, non-human of a pony
07.-.
0Yeah, Cross and Arrow is great
I 100% don't trust fox news
I can't see her caring about any kind of relationship
Anything on that is retarded.
0I agree most of the time
0but some people make it work
<eXAKR> I was wondering where to find the HGSS soundtrack <-- I have a HGSS Soundtrack thats about 866MB XD
Cross and an Arrow is promising, at this point.
Ok folks
I'll believe it when I see it
Especially secret-keeping.
The Empy Room

Oh, sheeit
[SPOLIERS] The Empty Room or something, it's basically Celestia finds a hidden room of her daughter.
Oh...it's all over?
Also, ton of good ideas in this thread.

03you don't use Winamp?
yup. streams start at 7 EST on fridays.
I don't anymore
you can doubble the size to WAV
When did the movies end?

I liked it
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-empty-room.html
03is it its own media player?
That's actually the third story down on my list.
That story
Yeah, it was pretty well done
12?
IT'S OVER
I've been meaning to read TER
ಠ_ಠ
I thought it was cool, but it wasn't spectacular.
Then start Dangerous Business.
the software looks complex but its easy to use
also it wasnt free, but *cough*torrentedit*cough*
03but why do you need it instead of using winamp?
Apparently it's good.
We are at 40 and wearing down
But I dunno.
03also I misread it as "torrent edit"
how many chapters of past sins are there?
I REALLY liked only a few fics.
Then the author... Gosh..
13?
13
atm
the author posts in clumps
Okay, seems doable.
3 at a time
Any other jazz tapes?
for wat fic?
Twelve was freaking amazing.
Djemba: People were spamming it.
Oh

Thats it

I'd be his neighbor
wait
he's cool is all
03well
Until Kira killed him.
Dam u Kira
u noe the way Kira died was pretty lame
it crashes when i try to close winamp or go into the menu settings
Musta missed that episode of DN
well even gods die
Spike can play Saxaphone with one hand...WHAT CAN YOU DO!?
kira is not a person
Depends on which version of the show you saw.
kira is a concept
Manga or anime.
well i mean raito
other people were "kira" for awhile
;p
lol engrish
Evey took over for him to rebuild =D
Yagami was a person
It's his name, to them.
The voices are telling me scary things...
They are looking for Kira.
I've got such a headache.
: O
That means a person.
WOOOOOOOOT
I woke up Thursday with such a bad hangover...
They thought of him as a person,
I GOT MY CLASSES
awesome
It's a name/title.
03told you you would :P
because they thought thwere was just one person
"Go ahead, shoot! You are only killing a man!"
No.
you now wats a good anime, Gurren Lagann
?
Anime?
I AM CONFUZZLED
Confluttershy
WHY YOU NO LOGIC!?
lol
and haven't picked it back up uet
*yet
basically
people have this option to add them to the worksheet
The show went downhill for me after a certain some1 went away
Kira is not always spoken of as a person, It's not a tital for a person
but you can't actually ADD them until they day
Oh hey
people look for Kira, but that doesn't mean they're looking for a person
since you're putting one on hold
Anyone got the THundercats Premeire for DL?
but as people finish their worksheets
wish, heard it was good
they drop the courses they dont need
Yeah they are.
lmao
ARE SUPRISINGLY TASTY
They are clearly looking for the person.

Light Yagami (夜神 月 Yagami Raito?), also known as Kira
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Yagami
square square square
TO THE MOON WITH YOU
She seems very afraid of Celestia banishing ponies.
She knows the power.
Plus, there seems to be too little crime for her to use it much.
Let us all carry on.
I am back
okay, I need to sleep
I'd say Kira is a bad example of this symbol thing, because Kira died
Yo.
well they NEED to increase the debt limit first of all
We can both agree that the Light/Ryuk fics should never exist.
they should
!
:D
aw, shit, man, really?
USA Debt. Ha
I'm talking about a horrible slashfic pairing.
>.<
Kira CAN exist... just get rid of organized religion
hey lets not bring that in here
huh?
hm
Kira would become a religion.
Or somesuch
we has a drf
I'd rather not talk about religoen here
Just like in the show.
03yes we do
if all palaces.
ya touchy subject man
Ok...thats it, I must see this movie
Spirituality is fine.
w/e just forget about it
Like the Catholic church calling conspiracy when the media called them out on their kid fucking.
dude.
Religion works like this: We know that the energy in our brains dissipates to some other place when we die. Where that is, is entirely up to you.
I'd prefer rational thought to spiritiality or whatever, but that's me and only me
Therefore, we make our own religion by our beliefs
hows it been going man?
03alright
lol
XP
:(
Hey guys, let's not bring up religion. That's a good way to turn friends into enemies really fast.
Going on experience here.
A theist? GET HIM
Night
see.
Believe whatever you want.
Discussing religion with redditors is never a good idea.
oh, wait, you said... my bad
Haha
I MUST DEFEND MY POLYMONOTHEISM
>=)
A griffin couldn't get along with some ponies
nah i cant
DEFEND MY MONAURAL SOUND SYSTEM
I agree with that one!
well i mean personality wise
thats a racial thing XP
yep
nah
nah?
Not because of her personality, but just because I wanna ship her with Pinkie Pie.

lol
BECAUSE I CAN!
OK, LETS GO WITH THAT
But I am anyway.

Men are men by definition...

I saw him too I think
I saw something flicker on the left side of the screen

03I offered a buy it now but as soon as someone bids, that goes away
03XD
12*auctioning
03basically
03I paid about $13 for each
03I bought 5
Sorry, I got quiet for a minute
03I have one opened, and one opened, for myself
03er
03*one unopened
03I listed the other 3 with $10 starting bids and $50 buy it now

03with shipping it was like $110 for all 5 CDs
12had me thinking for a second
03figuring if I make $150
03XD
0good man.
03well the bid's already to about $12.50 and it's only been listed for a day

0she is talking to the CMC
12ahh
I'm the world champion!
Oooohhh yeah!
0my heart... she cannot take it
0Indeed.
0Fluttershhy is probably my favorite pony.
12http://most-expensive.net/ice
but I think I like Pinkie more
0It
:3
0s a pretty close call though
She's just not as special as the rest
barely
0Indeed.
bbl, wish me luck for my piano comp
0She's... stereo-typical i think
Eh
She's dependably
*dependable
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3cRWJcZjW4&feature=related
If that makes here boring, then, that's that
0All the ponies are dependable.
12wish you fantastic luck
0From all I have seen.
0eeeeeeyup
Some say "Rarity is the best pony"
0they also have the least screen time
possibly ironically *shrug&
Eeeeeeyup <3
0like derpy
12this site is scary drf lol
0Luna
My favorite Applejack moment is the "Cain't hear you. Ah'm asleep. *honk-shew, honk-shew*"
03XD
12http://most-expensive.net/foods
XDDD
12there you go
honk-shew honk-shew~
0can't believe the fanbase for Luna... a character that got like two lines and was never heard from again
12then run when you see the bill
Well, she's interesting in concept
0how are you supposed to write her back in?
She's gone. . .
0she's ruling with her sister
0she's easy to write back in, i tihnk
Unless she comes back and is all shoop-da-whoop
03LOL
0i'm hoping she's in the pilot for season 2
02[The current time where I live is 0303:39:5602 on 03Saturday, 07/30/201102. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
Well, she's not gone
03I just have to fix my clocks since the power went out and reset a few of thjem
03*them
Did you not watch 'til after the credits?
0>_>
;D
12it's not too hard to take my time and add one hour :P
Oh
0Not okay.
0D:
I'm just kidding with you. . . ;A;
0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYdJT_KY5_s&feature=related
0I figured.
I'm debating. . .
0It's all but confirmed Luna is going to be in a season 2 episode, but I can't fathom how she would act
0she may very well never be spoken of again
I recorded myself trying to sound like Fluttershy. . . but I don't think I should upload it. . x.x
0but yeah, I'm no script writer.
Keen*
Yeah
Mmmm. . .
Me neither. .
It was kind of. . .
0Lauren Fasut apoloized for it
Well, Twilight was kind a douche throughout
0the wrote a whole blog thing about it
0so it's okay.
0http://www.mylittleponynews.com/2011/02/feeling-pinky-keen-controversy.html
It
is about the willing suspension of disbelief
Pinkie isn't some unexplained pheonomenon
"Some interpret the moral, and the episode, as implying that it's bad to search for explanations for things one doesn't understand."
She's a cartoon character
^ This person. Is an idiot.
0?!
/me 0I'm the only other one posting
No no~
THe quote I put dow
down*
0oohhh
0okay.
And Pinkie does things that defy explanation
03woah, power spike
we take that without questioning because it's just a show
0don't worry about that episode... just have faith that it was all for the best
03luckily the darned clocks didn't go out again >_>
0which a lot of the fans probably are, at least on reddi
0t
Which isn't necessarily bad. . . Because it wasn't shoving it down people's throates. . .
0its a difficult morale... but sometimes you have to speak from the heart and take a stab at it
Yes, I

0I tihnk it was an exaggeration.
Do you ever feel, like a plastic BLARGHARGARGH?

And that's how Equestria was made!
0so that's how she told the story.
0exactly.

Makes 'em go, BAUAGH, BAUAGH, BAUAGH
And Equestria is pretty magical
0farming for rarer materials?
Growing rarer materials in rocks
Eh, I'm sure it was abore
0Pinkie: If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!
most of it is still pushing rocks around
0I'll stick with my Theory .
Yeah, I thought pinkie may have been exaggerating when I watched the episode though
It's her character!
Killing Joke line, and all
Not to mention possible contradictions

DragonRage still thinks DashiePie is the best sounding ship name.
Another fine choice, Elky.
How 'bout Rainbow Pie?
@Nittany_Tiger_ probably from the period where she lived with Granny Pie
Pinkie works well with everyone... 'Moon Pie'
I don't remember that part.
That... makes Pinkie's childhood timeline make a lot more sense, Smolder. Thanks for taking a weight off my nerdy shoulders. :D
Poor porcupines :(
yep... it is sad
Although umm, aren't unicorns near immortal?
why would dragons live for that long?

FOR PLOT
Best plot
Is something wrong with me?
10yes
Get to learnin' it, man.
Spike, you're doing it wrong
inafter Applejack being perfectly reasonable
We don't take kindly to unicorns around here!
I've always liked that idea, Maxaminus. One alicorn for day, one for night, one for Twilight :D
Pssh, everybody knows Derpy's the third alicorn
Rainbow Day inc
Derpy can be Dawn. Her colours do fit it slightly.
That sure was quite the speech.

This is the episode where everypony learns the value of middle management.
Ditsy Doo didn't fly the wrong way, all the other birds did
Why no team leader vest for Pinkie?
indeeed
because Pinkie worked alone at first
Clouds
How do they work?
Pinkie Pie's part of the weather team, and Dash is the weather team leader.
Ahh
Huzzah for herdmind.
Clearly Pinkie should be the leader. :3
And then next episode it's fall again.
lol
I find it weird how they turn winter in to spring... or more like summer in a day
Screw canon, I'm gonna sew a team leader vest for Pinkie
is it still WWU, or next episode
7its magic!
*high
end of WWU
That vest is hideous
6>no team leader vest for Pinkie, Rarity, or Fluttershy

We had a hearty laugh when he fell asleep on the ice... well, we're not laughing now.
Spike must have narcolepsy.
And then he drowned
There's no such thing as the worst pony/ponies.
Except for Daisy
10I'm gonna hide here and make sure I don't do anything else wrong :23

Finally, someone has it right. Thank you DragonRage.

It's like saying "Timmy is my worst child."
well, maybe he is?
I like kicking! It involves hoofsies.
10yay~

First name that came to mind, HeavyMetal XD
QED, kicking is awesome.

Who's streaming?
lol no, it's not really correct usage either way since I have not demonstrated logically that hoofsies are awesome.
yeah, I know, but I've already shipped you with Rainbow Dash and having two RBD's is a little confusing

>implying Derpy, as a symbolic representation of the fandom's relationship with the production team, isn't *one* of the best ponies
10BEST DAY EVER. BEST PONY EVER.
8dash just did something no pony else can do
Can I race to the bathroom, get my alternate stream ready, and start it on synch in time? Challenge Accepted, encouragement appreciated
well Derpy is pretty awesome
8u mad wonderbolts?
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
Rainbow's a Mary Sue
come at me wonderbolts!
Celestia is the Sun, the Alicorn is just an avatar. She's too busy fusing hydrogen to worry about ponies.
You saved our lives, we are eternally grateful /lgms
And adults, of course.
10also: I need to read a good SpitfirexDash after this.
6LIES. I should go to Derpy.

wiki says 81-96, depending on the cut
OOHHHH! I GET IT!
DragonRage's brain is full of accent now. I can't even think straight.
It was average length when it was released, Elky. Now movies get laughed out of the room if they aren't at least 120 minutes >.>
@HeavyMetalPony this is in Leeds
10HeavyMetalPony... it's in britain

O.o
didn't know it changed litke that
These are photos of his estranged father he never knew
6Because... *cigarette*
I don't either, Elky. Since society is getting more and more "I want it now now now," you'd think movies would get SHORTER.
7and I
yup
Good theory. Either that or directors just want to prove their balls are bigger than others'.
I like long movies
Some pretty epic Bollywood movies out there. :3
well, the best movies are often the long ones
I keep getting "Connection Timed Out" tried multiple browsers/refreshes/restarted
6Suddenly lesbians.
where?
hmm not that... brb
Still, the best movies are the ones you don't really have to pay attention to because they have awesome music
prudence is a real name?
@Elky yes
ok good
Connection Timed Out again
Deeeear Furchtegott...
Slowly...the characters assemble

Wut?

Hey.
I can imagine it would be quite a polarising topic among the viewers.
I believe we had a conversation about that and the mods said it'd be okay
!ew harbour showers
13EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW HARBOUR SHOWERS
03and, edited it
03since3 ew swearing
03-3
hm
I myself would be more than okay with reading subtitles, but I can imagine how someponies wouldn't be.
6Tuba, it's something that the mods would likely vote on when the movie is picked.
Doesn't move when I look at it.
Well, is 3 hour movie okay? :P
6It's a case-by-case basis.
^^that's coming up
Well if there's a foreign movie of good enough quality should it even matter?
enlarge it
6lolwhat
03colored nicks or whatever?
yea
03o.o
12ov0
/me hides
10HeavyMetalPony no it shouldn't matter. That's the reason why you'd pick a foreign film anyway, because it's -good- not because it's foreign
6^lol
o.o
12I'm making a Ho-oh Shrine theme for the forum

/me MOVIE TRIVIA: The non-existent joint in the "With a Little Help From My Friends" sequence is non-existent to ensure that the movie is not R-rated.
Fuck you, eyeballs

we're gonna smoke you with our invisible joints!

@DragonRage the early parts, namely high school, are kind of boring exposition, but it sets up the plot for later events
When is high school *not* boring, though?
12...
lol not like that

But that's not high school. It's secondary school/sixth form D:

Oh okay, you're right. :P

I have mixed feelings on the cover
My Little Pony: Resistance is Futile.
http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://www.veemi.com/view.php?v=BronyState
6TF?
It is.
I think its a nice cover, maybe not stand alone, but fits well into the picture

10ReticentSmolder haha really?
Normally, I hate musicals, but I actually dig the singing in this.
I hope it's TNG, if there is. :P
or Enterprise... most underrated trek ever.
/me That peculiar fashion is a zoot suit, sported by the Mexican-American gansters of LA mainly as a charicature of the common 50's working man.
Also, agreed, Nittany, except without the part about hating musicals. XD
why would anyone hate musicals?
I do.
They're stupid.
if veemi is down, how am i still watching the movie o.O
i thought zoot suits were a 1920s style?
6I have NO idea.
I dunno, you've got a movie and some awesome songs in it. What's not to like?
crazy shit
6I am WAY to high for this shit.
I do!
6*too
we're all high!
@GGala they lasted awhile, the style lasting through multiple generations and alterations, that's just the origin of the style

That said, musicals where everyone sings about everything that happens are bad examples of the genre. Like Rock-A-Doodle.
12ogawd
I find Singing in the Rain 100 times more plausible than pretty much any given fantasy movie.

My radar program can do 3D radar images.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.
/me yaaaawns

The program I used for that image is called GR2 Analyst.
If you're wondering.
Ciao, Tuba.

02Because it's closer to HEEELLL :D
6FUKKEN MAGIC
XD
where in the netherlands? holland?
Can't wait till next friday- Inception :D
02Netherlands is the Country, Holland is like a state or something; not really sure .-.
02and yes. I'm at holland
I still think inception is kind of a poor choice
...
Holland is just another name for NL
they're synonyms
02.____________________________________. .------------------------------.
My friend says watch it twice to understand it
well the movie's good
back
/me googles it
but it's like choosing pirates of the carribean or something
did you know that the Netherlands are the biggest coffee drinkers on the planet?
holland is the western part of the NL
they average in 5 cups a person per day
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland
12I thought Holland was no longer the name for it
6Elky... you do realize that that statement just was one of the dumbest things I've ever herd, don't you?
02It isn't the same thing drf
02http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080316180819AAGsRVv
12hmm I see
I thought that was Seattle...
I didn't really have a good movie to compare it to
/me runs
For me it's more that studies are starting up again. :3
12I always thought they were the same, but that Holland was the old name for it
same Arti
Still, nothing can possible suck as badly as spider's web.
The B-movies are also good!
6EEEEEEEEEEEENOPE
6This week is proof of that, Elky.
Elky, as opposed to Aladdin and Mulan?
6NOPONY had even HERD of Across the Universe.
^
tbh, I've seen neither of those
02he should be nickalerted when someone says coffe--
02well he's not here. xD
I've heard of Across the Universe. :/
We need more skater chicks.
timing
XDDD
in any case
best pony :3
This should actually be a thing.
6Well, Elky, it's called mixing it up.
Elky, you've never seen either of those? How?!
but yeah, you're right, it is just my opinion, man

Missing Spider's Web is pretty much the best way to see it.

Why all the Spider's Web hate?
02I'm geeeetting sleeepy

Wait.
02But I refuse to sleeeeeep
Haseo, here's something for you to laugh at: http://speedtest.net/result/1409809525.png
6Need something about spoilers, IMO
Sorry, wrong movie.
I think.
I don't know.
Dari.
Are you thinking Charlotte's Web?
02Because sleep is for the weeeeak
EeeeeeeeeeeeNOPE.
Because that's awesome.
ill put in something about being respectful
I restreamed Spider's Web because I missed it.
spider's web is a bad ripoff
and specifically mention spoilering
I don't want to see anything to do with pigs after that episode
Was an awesome film. :P
no it's not
*film

Meh, we could pretty much just paste the tables?
With all the films.
not that bad
Oh okay, not too much I'm all that sad to have missed. :P
some people here stay up till 4AM ;;P
6I was going to do the tables with all the films, actually.
02I could
02buuuut'
MFW I should have kept all the tables, but just replaced them.
6Up! was with DS2
02I woke up at 5am
oh
D: dari
6I kept them all.
02thank you timezones
Oh, nice.
6I keep records of EVERYTHING.
Man, we saw Up! and DS2 near the start of July?
The movie that went with Deathstalker II was Up
It feels like it was just last week. =/
I didn't really like Up.

6Well, is there even really anything we still need to cover?
6For the moment anyway?
uh, okay...
6Until the rough draft is written up...
I found that too :D
well the thing I'd like to focus on mostly is wording

mfw all I know about how Brits speak I learned from Yu-Gi-Oh The Abridged Series
really good soundtrack too
:3
/me wonders how it is
ehh close enough elky
probably not the best guide
It looked ok, but not the kind of thing I'd go and watch by myself
7RobotPinkie: is from?
I'm from Sweden
embarrassing.
well it is definitely a dumb movie
03wut
03XD
but the good kind of dumb, not the transformers 2 kind of dumb

It's been a loooooong time

which was really got me to not like TF2 aside everything else
7Nah I live in the Netherlands now,but got raised in the USA
I live in PA.
Oh cool
I mean the first had its moments but it was never to the same extent
8>mfw 2 of the mods live in PA
yeah, the humor is only worthy of live-audience style loling

That's all I can think of.

Veemi's down?
lol American media is kind of nuts at times.
Really?
Money.
yep
Did the movie finish before it went down?
Lol.
6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
6Went down at the start of the movie.
How far in was it?
we were able to keep broadcasting
The money we give to people that won't give it back.
in britain politics are top of the line.
6Nopony noticed until the end of the movie, really.
7I just drag my boyfriend with me :P

why does mibbit collapse the images like that anyway?
Do you really think people want to know which mod is emailing them their BMN subscription?
Is it that important to people?
6I don't send out the subscriptions.
6Some people like to know who's going to check the email if they try to contact us.
I mean some images work perfectly fine

As far as I recall he said he had a script ready

...no, that'd be asking for problems, I guess
not sure whether to use that as my background...
just kidding
yeah
I'm just joking
the links at the bottom are presumably nsfw
you have to see it for yourself
see if it's safe for work or not yourself
Is ponyspin.com NSFW or not?
i think we should have maybe 2 people
see for yourself
6I was thinking 3.
14No one wants a mouse LOL
14they stink
fine with me
oops
that handle the complaints
well, technically it's not porn...
I have that background saved already, Sathi
See. For. Yourself.
any objections?
03A computer mouse LOL

Luna had the guts to go up against Celestia.THAT,my friends,is awesome.

I guess I'll just have to accept that people won't come to me with their complaint if it's about me
go to ponyspin.
6lol @ Sathi attempting to use forum/imageboard code
yeah
7I failed
we've had this discussion :P people are scared to complain to someone with power about said person
7:D
6It's not the way people work.
Then yeah, I'm on board
I hope that evil luna is not canon
I don't care, like, at all.
6*COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE MUSIC*
I'm just sad we probably won't see Photo Finish again

People just PM either myself, Hip, or Sprinks if they have a complaint?
my stream dieded
lol
900 spins :D
ADD A TEASPOON OF GODZILLA.
And then take it up in the mod channel?
6Pretty much.
ugh, you are sick partysmores

Got it
Elky, see for yourself if it's NSFW or not.

Anna Wintour
thats the one elky
I was there partysmores
Hip, how's the draft coming?
I know the site

Alright

I think you should add this to the about page
Pinkie > all
6?
Nice
it's rather important
She's like the highlander after finishing off all other immortals.
6>implying it's not already on my tripcode explorer list
nice
6Eyup.
6I look for everything.
XD
6I'm looking for a tripcode that says tripcode.
how long till pinkie destroys the 4th wall...
did you ever see that !Ponychan trip that one time?
the complaint department ;)
you mean to the "duties" section?
She hasn't already?
04XD
Just update the About Us to include the mods that handle complaints
:D owl city fluttershies parody!
yes or as a special part of the about page
I <3 this one
ugh that song
UMAD elky
YES I MAD
http://mibpaste.com/awfgA4
I've been unable to find this in YT...
good?
SOOOOOO MAD
you found it now?
I'd like to...
Relax, have some pony
type in owl city fireflies parody it's on the first page.
Looks good
hey
:D
postshow?
not really
Now my collection is complete... for now.
8bit wrap up :D
Looks good to me
more like postplaylist
man I messed it up
6One warning for any given thing.
6Repeat that one thing, get kicked.
Really? Just one warning?
I've only read 2722 before
./random
was there even a postshow?
Don't you think it may get lost amongst the postings of around 200 people?
2 really
6I see no reason to have to nor want to remind people.
I agree with Hip
2 warnings, then kick
6Kicks are essentially just warning anyway.
06I need to stop being shy about my voice I guess
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ebiaEG_clZQ/TjSQtIGQGsI/AAAAAAAAJhA/QtIrePLT5ow/s1600/rainbowdash_zetto_genki_dama_by_riokenng3-d425lf9.jpg
kick is a warning
1 warning then kick
/me flop
I just think one warning isn't fair
6Eyup.
I dont even kno whats going on anymore
needs moar rasenshuriken
But how many people see a kick as a warning?
unless pinkamena
14As I was saying
14I don't understand
wat.
ignore my terrible grammar
14Drake wins my battle
I just don't think it's fair to the users is all.
how is it not fair?
/me OTL
I think 2 warnings is the optimum amount of warnings followed by a kick
14Well
14Even then
14You said you wouldn't have won for those crits
6I have no problem with two then a kick about SOME things.
6But some things need only one warning.
frankly I think we have been too lenient with warnings as it is
Then let's re work that
14Hey Espeon
14I got muted again
14:'D
No doubt
04XD
Eeyuo
*eeyup
Colors are good, yeah
14But I wanna battle too D:
04May
04PM, now.
I still think it depends
14Okay
>implying Rainbow Dash could be any more awesome
Last is the image/video links
^
That bothers me
problem is here though
i want a concrete framework set up for these
6As do I.
worst misspell of pinkie pie ever
Doesn't bother me.
It makes it seem like the rules are just a formality
lol
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zyV8S1_cXXo/TjSQlYUzZnI/AAAAAAAAJgA/Uk0lO3Lrf74/s1600/baby_octavia_in_socks_by_kelliek94-d423ohe.png
D'awwww
meh 5/10 on the cute scale.
6...then he'd complain to one of us.
And then we'd handle the problem? Why not nip it now?
Why wait until it actually happens?
6Because removing that line creates more problems than it solves.
we NEED that disclaimer in there
it gives us the flexibility to deal with problems as they arise
XD
Let me get this straight, that disclaimer in there is more of a deterrent than anything else, am I correct?
6That way people can't pull loopholes on us
1 being lowest?
I guess nothing not-cute would even be rated?
yeah.
when i told him no he said "well, there's nothing in the rules that says I can't"
Then I'm with you
6And I straight up told him if he did I'd permaban his entire area.
thats why we need it
Kick-Ass is Kick-Ass.'Nuff said.
not more than 3/10
for situations like that
what's with the meme of ponies with socks?
Till we'd banned every area in the world.
No idea, really
um nothing
Kick-Ass is my favorite movie of all time.
it's... just there?
It's cute though :3
YFW it doesn't with an onion router.
I know, I'm well aware that most rules have that at the bottom. Doesn't mean I like it
it really is very important for us to have it in there
Yeah, I know
I just hope none of us abuse it
Including myself
Night y'all
Cya.

06You're welcome
/me flops out of sight
bye Elky
I don't expect it to happen, but I've come to expect anything
Looking at the past movies I missed here, I missed some good ones.
suddenly derpy
Yes, its working again.
I was itching for tornadoes in May like every year.
the section on being respectful
I was one in april
:D
I had watch clips of the show by May.
Because they clearly have nothing worth contributing to conversation.
But we've had that before, and those guys have been kicked. Don't know if they haven't been banned later, but I've seen them only be kicked
the community is the best part of it.
And THEN if they come back in and do it again, they're banned
and trolls arent going to read the rules anyway
In fact, that's how I did my first night moderating
Anyway, not all mods react the same way to different things.
Well, without ponies, no community :3
i only converted at like the end of june
i banned outright when we had that mini-raid a few weeks ago
For example I'd like insta-ban for racism.
Likewise.
Not everyon agrees with me.
everyone*
Hooked since the first episode
I didn't really convert. I just slowly slipped in.
my first movie night was july 15
but yeah, lots of awesome creative people in the community
oooh, dari, good thinking
I didn't need any more convincing that ponies were awesome after ep 1.
This seems to be tying into the disclaimer at the bottom.
I guess I didn't need much after the first episode I watched, wasn't the first though
Oh wait. My tipping point was "ponies that can control the weather!"
Someone linked me to episode 6, and I watched it :P
Because dari's right, every mod uses his own judging and discretion
Or implying that I'd think that anyway.
That was from the same episode.
I heard you banned SoiPony for saying something about RD
A joke, of course, but still XD
Then I jumped to Episode 1 and watched the whole of season 1 in a week.
lol
Haha, I probably did.
04'Daww thanks Espy :P
Trollbans for all!
6>a week
in a day.
Oh lord
my tipping point was probably "it was under e". odd, i know
LIKE A BOSS
6I watched all the episodes that were out at the time in a day.
lol wat
lol some people have to work and study :P
6Granted, there were only ten. XD
Then I proceeded to watch the rest of it.
It was ok.
there were about 24 out when I joined
BMN Caffeine Edition madness I expect.
DA MAGIKZ.
/me pulls up an episode list.
Damn, I've only modded 11 BMNs
the season was over when i discovered ponies
6More than me. XD
22?
6Also...
I can't believe it's only been...that
6I've modded 8. And the postshow for week 4.
Good
Myeah, season was over when I discovered it too
6Sounds good to me.
Ep 22.
/me has the list.
6YES.
the "cupcakes" rule
Don't do it?
Whee
HIT US WITH IT, HIP
basically
granted that the title throws you off how epic this song is
1 minute while i work out the wording
wut
No, no no
Now THAT'S oppressive :D
i could just scream
Do we kick if they try to stir up drama, or warn and then kick?
6Depends on the severity of it.
*squeak*
That's another thing, I think PMing the drama starting is a good idea
It singles them out
6>implying that everypony reads the PMs without having to be told they were sent one.
>implying I don't send notices instead of PMs
Unless we put up something about the PMs in the rules
I try really hard to make sure that I diffuse the problem without letting anyone know about the problem existing XD
um
:P
I never use those : /
can you send me one dari?
ty
...did he get it?
6...my ad is for gmail. XD
Yeah.
The message didn't come up for me : /
Does it not show up to the sender?
6It doesn't.
oh wait, there's no mythology here?
6Eyup.
:w
:3*
o hi doggy
I'm guessing several guys watched the first episode at the same time.
: /
Do we have to watch the room again guys?
I know, I know, we need it
I'd like viewers to think that we're not completely stripping them of their right to free speech
posting here is a privilege, not a right
Still... :(
Look, the way how I see is that as long as the discussion remains civil, it shouldn't be looked down upon
RD is just BEST at everything.
pinkie is my favorite overall
I have a real problem with that
Honestly
trixie didn't beat her.
The one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie :(
>implying discussions on those topics ever stays civil
>implying it always happens
Because it rarely does
7TS is best end of discussion :P
thats why we need that rule
No dari! Bad mod!
to keep people from stirring shit up
trixie has to be the most overrated character though
That's restrictive though
I don't like the rule
That's way too limiting
8 1. RD 2. TS
8dealwithit.jpg
Sethistio, Y U NO HATE TRIXIE
Trixie is not supposed to have a fanbase,yet she does.
That rule implies that people don't have the common decency to be civil
1. RD 2. Derpy
except her ex, rainbow dash
It's insulting
because in most cases they dont
not really
We still shouldn't put the banhammer down on someone for saying that they're a furry
LOL, this vidwo.
video*
7 1 TS 2 RD nuff said
10Scratch > RD > All
Top comment is awesome:
"Push 4 4 4 5 6 4 5﻿ 6 4 for the imperial march song."
lol
7all ponies equal!
Pony communism!
When has that ever happened?
if people want to discuss those things, they can go to /dis/
There's always been someone there to tell them to stop
its nearly happened 4 times that i can think of right off hand
She needs an episode in Season 2
But it's always been quelled
until myself or another mod put a stop to it
and i intend to keep it that way
10dari: yup
thats why the rule is in there
*heard
Wut
I do not accept that rule
As long as she doesn't THINK like Palin, I'm fine with that.
^
I refuse
It's not fair to anyone
Not even us
problem?
RD not favourite pony: BANBANBANBNABNABNBBNAABNBABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBANBABANBANBANBABNABANBABNABANBANBABNABANBANBANBABANBANBANBBNABANBANBAN
I has problem.
but seriously, 1. pinkie 2. rarity 3. spike 4. fluttershy 5. rainbow dash
10LOL
If people can't be themselves without us pushing down on them, then that's a shit rule
7oye
7you forgot someone
spike is not a pony!
he is a character
and he's attracted to fillies
I guess I'll accept that... He does have taste.
but in 2 of those cases i had to tell people to stop discussing the topics or i would start handing out bans
in mustaches
i fail to see how it is oppressive
Evil Spike is best Spike
MWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
*Moustache twiddle*
Yeah, villain Spike was awesome
Read the rule
It clearly states "no talking about politics or religion
That's completely fucked up
We're not allowing people to talk
agreed dari
because those topics ALWAYS start drama
A lot of places have rules agaisnt bringing up those topics.
EVERY
owlwlicious isn't in any of the other episodes though >.>
SINGLE
TIME
...
no
Is he even going to be back?
All he ever does is be helpful. ;_;
^
owliscious just wants to help man
That's not fair
he just helps twilight at night ;)
Just tell them not to start drama
that's all
gross
If you can change it to that, then I'm fine
._.
wat
functionally its going to be the exact same thing
how would that even...
Even on Ponychan, people talked about it
>supposed to be fun
6I say take the "politics, religion" out.
>people talk about politics and religion
I'm not gonna think about that.
>andnoasinglefunwashadthatday.jpg
not*
6Some political discussions and religious discussions are good.
And Ponychan can be pretty restricted, honestly
the stream oh dear
I've never seen a good one.
NEVER.
6If it turns to shit, we warn them.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/5175503e09ffb891d40e022ec80c6e2c/6380%20-%20Awesome_Face%20cheerilee.jpg
;o
I'm fine with leaving that bit in.
Actually, just say "don't start drama"
it worked :D
Haha
i dont know if you guys have been to the /dis/ board, but not a single thread on any of those topics doesnt involve a shitstorm
she's teaching the colts and fillies about /b/?
and thats even when rule #1 on the board sticky is "don't be a dick"
You can't bring up politics and religion without a shitstorm. It's not possible.
best teacher ever
Also she's a teacher, how's that not awesome?
they do
But it's not right to tell people that they can't talk about something
Politics and religion ALWAYS end badly.
It's
no
t
right
Usually as little as after the 2nd comment.
Why not?
Well, no...
And besides, the only people that ever do are pretty much trolls
Is this some "freedom of speech" thing?
Yes
arnold was a teacher in a movie once
:)
I'm telling you, I can't accept the rule as is
If we'll play requests!
Oh, I don't know. The whole of veemi is down.
I can't load the stream.
I can
the streams working for me
6>requests
It's working for me too.
03eo.o
well as mods we can cut discussions down if they turn into shitstorms?
>if
I'mma post a request!
haha
it becomes much harder once theyre in progress though
MUCH harder
03!pokemon
6No you're not~
03No I'm not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYN_VNYKz7g&feature=channel_video_title
not gonna lie this song is sick
well if people don't listen we can use the warning system as we discussed before... it's situational
03!pokemon
>;o
Hrm
03Cool, Unowns FTW XD
Nice
ooh
YEAH
as in disturbed?
no
And it makes it sound like we don't have any kind of faith in them and that they're fucking nothing
disturbed is bad
shooby doo! shoo shoo ba do!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNqsHbKgtwM
Sorry, but I really don't care if they think it's unfair.
i have NEVER seen ANY discussion on any of those topics i mentioned stay civil
^
We've always contained them
ALWAYS
^that.
and this rule is going to keep it that way
6>is not taking requests
I mad now.
That's fine.
go back in to to where you didn't get celebi using that script :(
Diner
*time
meh I think I'll go to sleep now
>we do nothing
night everyone!
>chat becomes a shitstorm
lol, i know about you not taking requests
night
>we cant contain it anymore
night
>users get pissed
6I was planning on it, but I'm frankly a bit too busy to review requests before airing them.
We always have done something
We never NOT do anything
>they leave and dont and come back
We have to do nothing if we don't have that in the rules.
Because they're allowed to talk about it.
next week, hopefully
They have to be trying.
You're undermining our abilities
They just have to mention one thing someone disagrees with.
Then EPIC SHITSTORM within 30 seconds of that comment.
I can't believe you guys seriously think that this rule is actually going to stop it
WE ALWAYS HAVE STOPPED IT
FUCK
It won't -stop- it per se, but we have a solid anchor to kick/ban from
other viewers see the negative repercussions
->profit
dont walk away just yet
fuck
Lawl.
12 2722* FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU
AHAHAHAHAHA
coolio :D
12NO U

people saying they're getting banned for having unpopular opinions
03hm
03anyone here know anything good/bad about Thermaltake power supplies?
6ponychan = DRAMA
^
exactly
We don't want any discussions period. Opinions are mentioned during discussion
I prefer forums to imageboards anyway.

brb restart
kk Kos
MFW we should have a forum.
single player generally
and i see it happen on /meta/ ALL the time
oh ok
10:3
a forum? why a forum?
6>we should have a forum
people say OMG I GOT BANNED BECAUSE THE MODS DONT LIKE MY OPINIONS
6Wouldn't be hard to do, but wouldn't get much traffic atm.
6And would be fairly pointless.
Meh, a forum would help keep dedicated viewers.
with this it would give us a concrete rule to point to for those complaints
I'm gonna go for today, just working on my WWU vests right now anyway
And would give viewers a place to discuss BMN things in a place where their comments won't just disappear.
And would give them somewhere to place complaints/suggestions, etc.
6*shrug*
g'night guys
6I could easily get one set up.
also toystory
YOU GOT A FRIEND IN ME.AWESOME.
With a forum we could also keep track of our modstuff / discussions
And a lot of modern FPSs have unlocks that give skilled and long-time players an advantage over you.
or discuss future plans / ideas
Like unbalancing damage perks.
Have you played Witcher? I don't see any time listed on that one.
I'll accept it
But I sure as fuck don't like it
No.
oh
Aladin?
As I said, I'll accept but I don't fucking don't care for it
And a bit harder than I want.
let me explain, because i do think its important
But more of the fact that it's getting dull.
oh ballsacks
wb Kos
thanks
i see it on ponychan ALL the time
Exactly, and I fucking hate that shit
nb and hi Obsi
stop for a minute
hihi
*np
let me finish before you interrupt
Go right ahead
I can't get into them because most of the games consist of me losing to higher-level opponents.
like i said, on ponychan i see it happen where people say "OMG YOU BANNED ME BECAUSE I HAD AN UNPOPULAR OPINION, YOU GUYS ARE TYRANTS"
BF2 was the same way. Too hard to get into.
Goodnight everypony!
with this rule in place, we make it clear that they are being told to stop NOT because of their opinions, but because of the topic
Night.
Night
Are you done?
I need a fucking tutorial on BC2.
pocahontas?
yes
That the reason we have the rule is because we don't have faith in the regular viewer and that we don't think they can behave apporpriately
Tell them
It's goddamn insulting
Yeah.
hello
just got back from Cowboys and Aliens
again
Then tell them
the majority of users probably can
How was it?
Either Tinychat or UStream.
Tell them that we don't think they can be civil without guidance
Saw that yesterday.
lol
7so much EQD posts suddenly :o
I was broadcasting Orbiter from Tinychat one night.
that wonderbolts dash doesn't look that great
I haven't finished that run.
Now this is DEFINITALLY Mulan
no, i just said they dont
Then why are we singling out everyone
oooooooooooooooooh
person A voices an unpopular opinion
>_>
:P
12:D
Why do we have to put down everyone else for a couple of assholes
Good luck with that.
You'll need it
Like I said, I'll accept it. But I don't like it
Me?
how was sucker punch, sky?
I don't agree with it
Yes.
I actually have artistic skill.
6Ghosties, it's because all it takes is one person that can't be civil.
And I have a plan to do it.
6The majority of our viewers are civil.
10It was pretty good
Then why punish ALL
10Dad walked away from it in 30 minutes though XD
A) Download plugin to handle texture files.
B) Modify them in GIMP.
Hah
