00,02Sumica, NO
Need is a strong word
$20m a ticket?
00,02Sumica, YOU NEED DEM
Sumica: TILT THE GODDAMN WINGS
00,02FUN
00,02dats the purpose
maybe if you point them the... the OTHER WAY! HAHA!
future carnival rides ftw
Sumica: make the wings tilt at a 75 degree angle I think
00,02DX
00,02XD
Phase4: listen to phase, its a "ditch wings" button
Sumica: TILT THEM THEN!
Ye with to high of hopes
Sumica: air resistance it knocking them off since their damn near FLAT
inb4 it actually gets into space
Raise your hands if you want to go faster....
Gonna go play some TF2 :)
Lawl

...or not
good afternoon everypony

Have fun Ponies47|TF2
00,02bai wings
maybe those ones just dont like being attached
you know what this calls for? more struts...
Sumica : to much G force
Stop thrust
And afternoon DeathStar
Not enough thrust
material sciences yet have to deliver something strong enough for this design
NOT ENOUGH RAILINGS!
hai DeathStar
hiya DeathStar
DeathStar: Howdy
looks fine so far
YAY PARACHUTE!
Lawl this is going to work
Deploy ALL the parachutes
If you stop thrust before deploying chute, the chutes have less chance of dying off
oh God
OH GOD NO!
OOOOoo
lol
THEY WERE GONNA LIVE!
MAYDAY MAYDAY
0,14all day white smoke
They're still smiling
how is everypony?

huzzah, they live another day
Rain: I'm pretty sure they shit EVERYTHING

Maybe if the spinny jets just become a later stage.
I love this gif http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/336/416/0ce.gif
who is streaming?
Sumica: FINE! But don't put them FLAT
DeadpoolDash: :D
yeah, airplane parts needs more work. Need to be able to tilt wings a bit...
00,02sonicrainboomer259, Sumica
but, cannot do right now
DeadpoolDash: LOL
I say into the wind
I don't know about you, but a wheel of spinning turbines and fuelage isn't that good for heading up into space...
worth a try
Sumica: TRY THAT!
YES!
of course into the wind means now jets spin round and roun
is dungeon & dragons online fun?cause i'm getting it on steam
IT WILL BE SO SWEET!
Sumica : that looks Legit
FOR SCIENCE!
It will be like smooth Jazz=WE CAN'T TAKE IT!
00,02Sumica, try it
00,02wings will do something
Sumica: CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF SOME OF THE THRUSTERS!
rotate the boosters
Sumica: make HALF go up the other half go side to side
can't you change the direction of the jets?
More thrusters. Always a good idea
hiya Dken2021 how are ya?
ok. So now jet engine expels hot gas directly into intake of next jet engine, and so on and so on...
YES!
Sumica: there you go
Sumica : yeah looks SAVE!!
00,02dats good
XD
it's been swell otakon, doing good?
Needs more.
dem thrusters
Sumica: make sure to attach them with LOTS OF DUCT TAPE!
Dken2021: okay it's been man
try downloading the movie with 5.1 audio and maybe try musing the center channel
need more barbeque
okay brb
It will blow the wings clear off wont it?
Sumica: looks legit!unless your trying to survive...
also, a Harder Faster Better Stronger mix that i did some months ago
http://www.mediafire.com/?eit4l5lyadvw1te
Hard to find any working 5.1 links
but it gets a bit derp towards the end
It just gets BETTER and BETTER
Dken2021: Muffins*
Sumica : looks good
Hmm, I don't think it has enough rockets. Anyone else?
>Sumica- try rotating the boosters at the end of the wings
So much lag incomming...
And science will ensue
08,01Phase4: not at the moment; i'll switch it on
DAYUM
Sumica: your my BEST FRIEND
Om: needs moar somethin
boom, boom, out goes the rocket

WHAT HAPPENED?
0,14in their toungue he is SWOOSHAKIIN, ROCKETBORN
Nope, needed more
Daft punk are quite tight on MT leaks, also, I could upscale some of their songs to surround, but they don't upscale terribly well because they keep their stuff in phase most of the time
dat lag
SaxyPretender: lol
Om: that's it
Who cares about the Kerbals, all that matters is if the parts survived!
I missed it!
Sumica: your astronauts will be cursing at you from heaven
SaxyPretender: SU-MI-CA!
OH God
0,14XD
OH GOD
WOW
:D
OH MY GOD
maybe too much thrusters?
NEVER
NEVER TO MANY
Dken2021: ...naw
I'm no expert, but I think that worked to well.
you might need auto pilot
i knew it wouldn't work..
Sumica: less thrusters
hmm… so in Season 2, we'll be dealing with a fully realized Avatar. I wonder if the show will end up like Medaka Box.

WrekBot|Candybar, you should be the Element of Surprise
normality? Whatever we can't deal with is our own problem...
128kps sounds crap, 160kps sounds passable, and 192 sounds almost perfect

Sumica: NO LAZY! DO IT FILLY!
fuel tank logic goes top to bottom, so the top tanks will empty quick, but the ones on the bottom tanks could burn a while

This needs a new name
Tower o' rockets
mother of god
hi

Kandarihu: the TOWER OF DOOM!
I keep losing fuel at 1,000 M -_-
inb4 crash
needs more rockets

inb4 it wobbles and falls over
and explosion before it leaves teh ground
YEAH
its not gonna fly straight
It will crash the program :P
how about....ROCKET OF HELL!!!
MOAR
needs fins
XD
Sumica: it's gonna crash man
sagas[A]: It needs more rockets is what it needs. And more fuel
http://i.imgur.com/MnCQk.gif
0,14otakon, well DUH, we just wanna see how hilarious it'll be
computer crash is immenent
inb4 shit ton lag
how tall is that?

XD
Wrek, you missed your cue.
OneTrickPony: IKR
and explosion before it laves the ground
Sumica: DO IT!
OneTrickPony: LOL
OH GOD
Uh, I happen to be bad about predicting that
Lawl
i hear something.
truth
...
I PREDICT WREK WILL KIC\K ME
XD
I don't think it can move...
can't hold all these particles!
So much particle!
Sumica: should have turned off the particle effects
whats happening?
i think it's flying
take off about 3-4 of those tanks
dat altimeter.
Irish_Pony: lag and lots of it
Irish_Pony: no one knows
Irish_Pony: Nothing. And everything.
laaaaaaaaaaaaguh
BSOD
LOL
woah
O_O
HOLY SHIT!
OH MAH GOD ITS ON THE MOON!
... are your tanks./. glowing orange???
0,14and suddenly this became a game of Touhou
Dude
XD
Sumica: you are made of CRAZY
ponibas|anime: that's not good
so much lag
whoooaaaaa! the hell is this?
CHICKEN HOUR!
laag
wtf?
XD
This might crash the game
If I could suggest a name for this, Sparkling Tower
OR SCOOTALOO HOUR
woah
Chicken_Luna: Chicken hour? that's a hoew hour
suddenly pink
hey hey!! Leave chickens alone!!
Pink Screen of Death
PINK
why's it pink
and I SEE FLEUR, LUNA AND MICA!
dat pink
Oh m6
I'm not a chicken. I'm trying to play TF2
*my
dammit. Today's Adventure Time left me with feels. Time to destroy them with Regular Show.
0,14this song sounds familiar
ahem NEW hour
Sumica didn't want us to see the result of his shift
AttackWithHugs: he's traveled outside of the universe
Ohai pinkie pie
looks like pinkie pie was here...
heh
0,14like Madonna?
ship*
Tovler: wasn't todays one with a hostage situation?
Camo Pinkie Pie
it broke again
otakon: yep
A better name for that rocket, Tower of Lag
he went so fast that he's in a new dimension
Tovler: THAT left you with feels?
Pinkie Pie! WHERE?!!? :o
OneTrickPony: exactly!
Sumica: okay, so next time HALF as many thrusters and fuel tanks
Turn off ALL the particle effects
otakon: no, the ending did.
rule of thumb - if your rocket is taller than the launch tower, it will lag to death
Tovler: okay I missed it so NOW I have to see it
otakon: lets double the fun, and add more boosters :D
noname: it'll lag out again
Sumica: HALF THAT AMOUNT!
oh god it saved
hmmm....oni con & ren fest are 1 week apart...I wonder if I'll have enough vacation days for the entire week...
the game can only handle so many independent objects.
XD
Sumica: I DARE YOU TO DO THAT AGAIN!!!
wait again
wut
fraps is going again
LOL
yep
do it
ahahahaa
Time to enter the Twilight Zone...
T-5
Sumica always crashes games
Science activated
/me places the chat under a steel bunker "We should be safe here"
AttackWithHugs: we're gonna need a bigger bunker
AttackWithHugs better triple up the laters
I want to record this
crashing the game is depressingly easy. It's too easy to build a rocket that the game cannot handle (not that it's easy to build either once rockets get big)
/me takes cover
remove 2 fuil tanks
XD
woah
WOW
/me extends the entire bunker
dafaq
LOL
...
WHAT
:D
i think its too tall
I think reality just broke

Well, it's going
ITS SO PRETTY
/me places chat in different country

Sumica: you broke reality!

A portal to equestria just opened, way to GO!
Where's the Kaboom?

its going fast?..
Adventure Time. Proving once again that Donald Faison is best princess.
Sumica is better off Trolling Sea ponies
The lag! It kills us!
i'm surprised it got into the air... apparently
There was supposed to be a rocket shattering Kaboom
I think those lines are the fabric of space-time continuum, and they are falling apart :D
0,14...wait, Donald Faison was in Adventure Time?

Oh my, all those pings xD
Cypresswolf it's.... yes
I think it shifts automatically to "Orbit" above a certain altutude.
NASA should fund this
Wow, what a trajectory
Does ya ship hang low does it wobble to the floor
I just got done with another one of my drawings, care to see? (It'll take a little bit to upload to DA)
He made it...
almost an orbit
/me claps
Trillions of dollars and we have made it...halfway across the planet. WAY TO GO :D
Also, hey CuddlyKittens11
and they were never heard from again
it's a parabola
LOL
Sumica: Wheel of Death is more than accurate
my god...
WHAT HAS SCIENCE DONE?!
Sumica : rename to either Space worm or Space Banana
The NASA Centipede
^
Keep that design...
That orbit isn't stable, is it?
That is just...
you can force it to shift between the two modes by clicking on it. It almost never reads surface when I want it to on Munar landings, unless I force it to
no
Please, That ship was BOSS

Hey guys im going to do it again tonight
03Your PS3 is dieing a slow death, and your basically looking for a short-term solution for a long-term problem. If you are past warranty, i would advise you to open your PS3 up and clean the insides and check on the thermal paste. I doubt an intercooler will help.
03:/
rave!
XD
FULL THROTLE!
I'm getting a Wii U eventually anyway. I may as well buy it at launch.
That is the worst design for a spacecraft I have ever seen

You should try adding some blades to it and see if you can make it fly like a helicopter.
GrimGallop: He tried that earlier, it didn't work
Try again! :D
bye bye :)
Disappoint.
he tried. unfortunately you cannot mount wings to a 10 degree or so pitch. Just 0 or 90
11,01Need to clean the debris up.
the aeronautic part of this game needs some work.
kek
yay
did it fall off?
lol
you can do that now, you have vectoring engine, no?

On the bright side, you're moving.

Sumica used fire spin, it wasnt very effective
ohwait

haha
do it again to test
awww
xD
D:
cooool
Is it bad when you start to fall asleep standing up?
boom?
anyone else here flown a plane?
Why do all big machines have such large and easy to use self destruct buttons?
Om: nah, it's perfectly natural
Om:
It didn't blow up in the way you were hoping to blow it up.
Om: I don't think that is possible?
so much lags
I flew one, Big_Macintosh_1992. It was made out of paper :3
Om: Yeah, IMPOSSIBRU
I sure hope it is.
I know why it turns like that
Or so I'm assuming, since you seemed surprised that dropping your engine made you explode.
haha Polydunami i suppose that counts lol
not impossibru. Just very brief.
Oh, it exploded, good to know
lol
fall asleep standing up, start falling, instantly wake up
the physics cant handle the rotation of the Kearth
you got air
0,14XD
pop in texture
That thing should be able to burrow underground.
but since sleepwalking is possible, sleepstanding logically should be as well
But are you talking about actually having piloted an airplane?
Om: sleepwalking time is all
MahBoi777: I haven't done that in a while.
Hey everypony.
less death on landing
/me changed his ringtone to a bit from "Rainbow Factory" today
wat?
Big_Macintosh_1992: Nice :)
baboom!
good plan. That runway was just getting in the way
Om: I do it alot, lol dunno why
Sumica: It's because the fuel line breaks
why?
How's everypony doing?
MahBoi777: This walk is what all true wariors strive for
try throttling down before detach
Sumica: try waiting till your in the water to detach it?
Om: indeed it is
SolairePony89 Heh, explosions are good.
So it falls in such a way that it hits the fuel tank
kaboom
SaxyPretender Hai dere.
:p
OH NOEZ! lost stream
this is getting a bit boring
SolairePony89 What are Kerbals?
Meanwhile, it's time for me to sleep.

That season finale was awesome. I liked it when Korra compressed all that air into one spot and released it in a giant explosion. It reminded me of Kuma from One Piece.
Big_Macintosh_1992 I cheered, personally. :)

hey Phase4
Phase4: I play your music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsAAUVCozcc&feature=g-all-f now defused the bomb in time\
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmZ2a8sCzz4
00,02i realy like the tf2 theme
o hai Phase4
00,02ohai
Phase4: I know right it is awesome
tf2 theme?
it's kickass. :)
welp i gtg, night everyone
gnight StupidSexyCarambola! take care
00,02i wonder how much tf2 has made vs how much one version of any shooter has made
nithe stup fuuuuuuuuuuuu
00,02divided by the development cost
00,02my money is on tf2 being magnitudes more profitable
Phase4: they made alot of money from keys...KEYS
KEYS.
ninja'd
LOL I REMEMBER WHEN I SPENT 200 DOLLARS ON KEYS
THOSE WE'RE THE DAYS
TheRareP0N3: got anything good?
no
cancer unusual
:C
that sucks
two unusuals acutally
soo
dovahkiin hat with sunbeams. ^_^
sold it for money
im back
Phase4: hmm what would you say if they thought about creating tf3 would that be something you would want to buy?
hi
hi
cow334: what are you talking about, valve can't count to 3
tf3?
00,02cow334, possibly, depends on how its different
noname: Then how is there a level THREE sentrie in tf2
DERP
ew
tf2
tf3
THEY CAN COUNT T THREE
^
00,02https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time
cow334: its actually 8 but the right side of the 8 got erased
left side*
Phase4: You gonna stream?
00,02mabey
Phase4: Morning.
00,02morning FairysHuff
Phase4: Well if you want you could set up a L4D2 match
Hows yee?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WKCBn4l-uQ
Phase4: hmm they have a lot of stuff ahead of them what is this about the pyro update?
noname: seems legit
I am looks forward to deadspace three
that is gonna be good
indeed lol
00,02cow334, yeah, thats why i'm not sure they'll make a tf3, tf2 is hyper polished and they are incrimentaly improving it
why do i keep find pocket in tf2? i have 12 already and its getting annoying
*Settles in for a long cuddle session with the chat* ~_~ *Snuggles up*
cow334 there is gonna be a meet the pyro
finding*
Phase4: Hows yee?
00,02i'm ok
Phase4: yeah well then hmm I dont think we will see a tf3 for a while then are we probaly wont see it at all eh well i am happy with tf2
00,02i would like to see the game tf2 was originaly envisioned to be
Phase4: which was?
00,02a 'fps rts' mashup
pfft
Phase4: Theres already games like that now.
chat deruped
Phase4: yup well I'm guess ing when they actually finiseh tf2 it will cost money to have it or they will just give it to us for free like nice people ..... i dunno
00,02would be very hard to pull off though, which is probably be why valve abandoned it
00,02FairysHuff, multiplayer
00,02there would be 'commanders' playing the rts part
00,02and players playing the fps part, ordered around by the commanders
00,02or something like that
00,02but yeah, its easy for that to fall apart
cow334 nope
Phase4: Ah... Sounds like it will rely a lot on the commanders. And you know some people will screw it up
BRB
Phase4 you mean like nuclear dawn
cow334 there is no official meet the pyro
00,02Chrysalis, i'm not aware of this game
exactly what your describing
already done
cow334 it comes out on june 27 i think

Phase4: fair enough
he gets more xp for not killing
well if you get more xp for not killing then try not to kill
I can't sleep, guys :<
Gunny: then dont go to sleep it is evil
04What he needs is the invisible boat mobile
lawl
:<
Gunny: Do what I do. Put some low volume music on, instrumental, no vocals. It helps
Gunny: -lol try thinking of something really trivial.
im guessing he doesnt have the super strength to move large boxes either
Gunny: Like a paradox
Iron_Edge, that will just make it worse xD
Gunny: Want me to give you a link of a real peacefull pony song that will make you go to sleep?
annnd
HE'S GONE!
Gunny: Like answer this question: How do you throw away the worlds largest trash can?
00,02o i c
00,02stun gun doesnt work
00,02:(
dont even try to attack them, just dodge them
evade them
Iron_Edge, I just don't even
yeh they have body armor on
Gunny: Or how do you know when to go at a stop sign, without a go sign?
stun gun works Phase4... you just have to get them from behind for it to work best
Phase4: Use the PEPS?
Iron_Edge: saw your latest drawing its god damn good :)
00,02FairysHuff, dont have it
also... blind firing the stun gun is never a good idea Phase4...
Phase4: Awwww. ~_~
00,02Midnight_Tempest, it works well if they are right around the corner
Assanate him
Gunny: -lol paradoxes, just think about it long enough and you'l be out like a light in no time :3
the best encounter is an avoided encounter
killerpony7733: -lol Sweetie belle?
Phase4: true, but just wait for him to turn around... you'll get him guaranteed and aim it...
FairysHuff, have you heard PinkiePieSwear's Hush Now Quiet Now [Lucid Dream Mix]
Gunny: No.
Iron_Edge: yeah it's really well shades and what not :P
Iron_Edge: shaded*
FairysHuff, it's epic
Gunny: I listen to a new age internet radio channel while sleeping. It helps me sleep.
wow i have a near 2 min lag on the stream to chat
my stream is lagging
RoboGerbil: Same
killerpony7733: -lol thanks.
Dat long delay
Iron_Edge: np :)
Guys. If guns don't kill people, people kill people. Does that mean that toasters don't toast toast, toast toasts toast?
yup
XAX: Yes.
yes
XAX: wow
guns dont kill people... bullets do
XAX: Of course :3
lol
dem toast
told you it would work Phase4...
dat emp nade
think when i did this part i shot 1 dude in the corner then snuck around the trucks
He just got emped
Its a flash bang
danm
Hey guys i'll see you later ok im off to bed talk to you guys later peace
oh well to me it look like a empe
emp
night xxMoopyxx
Night
night xxMoopyxx
xxMoopyxx: night
it was an emp... it causes a flashbang effect
*Moopy has left the chat*
00,02you'll see in a sec where the blind fire works
Midnight_Tempest: Been a long time since I last played so probably right
theres only 3 nades in the game, emp, gas and frag...
also... im way too good at this game, i can get through most of it without killing anyone or triggering alarms...
like a faust
Phase4: What'cha playin?
yeah, i know it works Phase4... but they have to be like 3 feet from you... and sometimes, your already dead at that point
00,02XAX, dx:hr
XAX Deus Ex: Human Revulution
ah.
Well that was ... uncomfortable... ~_~
00,02Midnight_Tempest, not if you lure them :P
revulution lol
Just got a call from the DWP about aranging a visit by a support officer.
Phase4: i dont lure, i watch and wait... learning their patrol patterns... then i strike like a demon from the shadows
lawl
00,02but that takes too much time
00,02and lureing is mroe fun
i pick up a gun adn just run throught them
and
the game is about stealth and patience, though luring is a good idea in some situations
Phase4: I like setting stun traps that go off when they pass by.
00,02FairysHuff, you must teach me that
/me is sad that she wasnt around to say goodnight to Shizuschlafen..
/me 00,02hugs Rain
well im off, night everypony :)
/me hugs Phase4
Phase4: Save all the grenades you pick up. Later you get a "Trap base" item. You combine with grenades to make traps.
may lunas stars help you sleep
well, this makes me wanna play DXHR now...
Phase4: it doesnt matter where you stop the cameras, if theyre red they dont alert
00,02RoboGerbil, oh cool
Phase4: One thing about traps. ALWAYS walk slowly and crouch when trying to disarm them or they will go off in your face
lawl
DX1 traps were the most annoying to try and disarm...
Midnight_Tempest: I liked them for exactly that reason
Midnight_Tempest: I used gas traps alot in that
yeah, it was fun setting up a gas nade and taking down 3 or more guys... or a couple frag nades to destroy a mech
dont buffer please dont buffer
I never used the frags. Made too much noise.
all the buffer
frag was when i was seen, emp was for silent mech kills
00,02brb
Midnight_Tempest: lol i never messed with the mechs
i loved taking on the mechs, especially when i knew i would win
I always reprogrammed the mechs to attack enemies
eyup
that was always fun too
mechs were easy enough to sneak around
hmm... i still need to finish the DLC for this game...
I need to get into duess ex from what y'll are saying it sounds like a cool game
I got bored. FInished the main game but not teh DLC. The first Deus Ex was better.
is it fun?
deus ex was amazing, invisible war was good but i still havent finished it and DXHR was pretty damn good too, except the boss fights... kinda ruined the mood of the game...
cow224: Very. Much harder. Though old so don't expect top notch graphics
bosses were kinda rough, especially on higher difficulties
FairysHuff: okay and don't worry i dont look into graphics when i play games
the bosses were a bad addition to the game...
00,02i have 2 points
Phase4: is that a good thing?
00,02praxis points
ah
dunno what those are?
try to get the icarus system Phase4
00,02Midnight_Tempest, i was thinking that
00,02i'll get the icarus
Phase4: it is crazy useful for the whole game
Lets him upgrade his cyborg implants
Phase4: get the one that lets you go invisible adn the one that lets you move large objects
Midnight_Tempest: eh if you like jumping yes
killerpony7733: and not dieing from falling off of tall places
00,02i can move large objects
Midnight_Tempest: just need to be careful you save yourself some praxis kits on that
00,02invisible one is on the list
Icarus is very useful for tactics as well. Get to a roof, drop behind guards on ground, double take down.
killerpony7733: i saved enough points in the game to have just about all the upgrades... its not hard
Moo
Midnight_Tempest: true but i can manage without
yeh but take downs are killing moves hes going for non lethal
takedowns can be non lethal too
RoboGerbil: Theres non-lethal takedowns as well.
hmm
RoboGerbil: Your taught them in the tutorial
Midnight_Tempest: one tab non lethal hold tab lethal
:D
00,02wanted to try the stun thing
00,02it broke
Hold Q for lethal takedown, tap Q for no-lethal takedown
lol when i played i went all lethal, was way easier
Thats why I go non-lethal. The challenge. I hate easy games
of course its easier... thats why there is an achievement for doing it without killing people, except bosses
Always play on hardest setting
Woah the delay is strong within this one
i should really play this again.. and go for those achievements
oh yeah... the stream is way behind
RoboGerbil: Play the original. It's better
FairysHuff: i dont have the first one adn i missed the sale lol
FairysHuff: yep executed game by the century
beta ponies sorry Phase4 but i need to send this link http://lunachan.net/pony/src/13382025982.jpg
RoboGerbil: pirate bay to the rescue!
00,02dat table
00,02flutterchu, image links are fine
Midnight_Tempest: no......not pirate bay you don't pirate such a good game
rather buy older games cuz its easier to get them running on newer os's than pirated stuff
Phase4: oh thank goodness
RoboGerbil: Try GOG.com
killerpony7733: bah, if people cant buy it or wont buy it... just download it, there isnt anything wrong with it...
ded chat is ded
Midnight_Tempest: if they really shit in the poor line sure, but i honestly believe in paying for my games tbh
huh
Midnight_Tempest: Really are in*
KIL KIL KIL
THAT AIMING:P
killerpony7733: i do too, but only for games that are worth it... most games these days arent worth it so... pirated
DUN DUN DUUUUNN
The ponys have upgraded through time
but i have the first DX on disc anyway so it doesnt matter to me
Midnight_Tempest: point taken but DX1 for one is a buy not pirate in my book
but ya failed
They have updraded there lookd
looks
hmm is it me or does the lauren fause firefly look better than the rainbow dash?
hi bronies! :)
kidding right
hey
http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/deus_ex
hello derpy_pony how are you
crotchshot?
the thing that disappointed me alot about this game was there wasn't a big tie in to the first DX... other than Bob Page and when you save Tracer Tong...
Midnight_Tempest: Well it IS a pre-quel
oO
00,02this might cause stream buffers
00,02tell me if you notice any
Midnight_Tempest: you can choose endings in a prequel? that isn't how they work
killerpony7733: The endings could have been better but I liked Jensens monologue over them at the end
00,02killerpony7733, i've seen a lets play that includes the ending
00,02the ending doesnt realy work
The monologues do.
FairysHuff: well done for endings but it can't fit with the fact its a prequel
good good, cow224. just had to do 4 hours of psychological tests. I'm curios how they will react when it turns out my mathematical talent goes off their scale. in the worst case they will compare me with sheldon from now on. :P
and you?
killerpony7733: yeah, but in the end the event of DX arent changed in anyway... this game doesnt even talk about the NSF at all, or it does but in a newspaper and briefly
FairysHuff: cause in the end this and this happen that causes this later on, not hey you choose this and thats how the world will look like later
sheldon cooper ftw
killerpony7733: *Shrugs* It's a game. We have that leeway.
Midnight_Tempest: Yeah true but it just felt stupid to add endings to a prequel
these guys play HALO
derpy_pony: well don't worry that is a really good thing dont listen to what any body says but even tho wow that is amazing keep it up
00,02dis is the boss fight isnt it
killerpony7733: but people would have complained if there wasnt choices... saying it wasnt the same as the other games that gave you ending choices
cant see were 2 mins behind on vid
FairysHuff: sure i just don't get the thinking when they knew about its a prequel and it can only have one action that leads to DX1
2 min.?
Midnight_Tempest: I know I would have complained.
a good mental arithmetic skill is not something I could turn into money...so it's more or less worthlless
Midnight_Tempest: May have been a bit off for the series but i would be okay with it due to the fact its a prequel
derpy_pony: Theres more to life than money
not for me...the rest is out of limits
thats sad but to each their own
I'm as social as a brick
yet your here derpy_pony... this is still socializing...
So fun to livestream.. Noone is actually watching..
derpy_pony: I mean self-fulfilment. Something your interested in that would use your talent for math.
derpy_pony: Astro-physics is my interest
BronyForLife: i am i have both my eyes on chat and the stream
uhm
As have I
hm...sounds good
Do you have 4 eyes?
AH GAWDAMN I REALLY NEED ADBLOCK
BronyForLife: nope just a very large eye sight tbh
I have eyes on my chin
Aright
Its hell to chave
Lawl four eyes but
...
Seems healthy
*shave
(__)~(__) it can happen
PLAY TF2!
BronyForLife: No
why nooooot
cause he's playing DXHR
sooo whaaaat
the stream is just lagging bad
now he's not..
YAAY DXHR TIME
BronyForLife: Cause their ALWAYS playing TF2. I'd like to see something different
he has alot of games..
I have over 200 I think
I have almost 100 games on steam
All on steam. Not counting boxed games
i have alot of free games
-_-
Dat super delay
http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/deus_ex
lol
dat chat is from 5 min. ago or something
Phase4: you might wanna restart the stream... the lag is at least 5-10 minutes behind
BronyForLife: yep extremely huge delay is huge
Much like my... eh... nevermind
00,02tell me if it starts to buffer
It's been buffering on and off for ages for me
there we go
looks like we have two A movies this week
Yay
its all synced now
it caught up now
We are LIVE WOAOAHAOHHFDA
Paul is dead.
Woot
BronyForLife: calm down... its too late to be acting like that
Kammerjunk: say what? :O
:(
killerpony7733: Turn me on, dead man.
Kammerjunk: DX1 parody? :D
proof: Deus is modern
killerpony7733: No, just an old Beatles rumour.
I want to see Phase4 get pulverised during the boss battle repeatedly ^_^ But I'm tired. Going to nap for a bit.
Kammerjunk: oh lol 6_9
I decided to play Notpron.
00,02night FairysHuff
It's fun.
00,02i might stop before the bos
Phase4: Laters
Phase4: I hope so ^_^ I want to see that
FairysHuff: fun fact you can win one of the boss fights with only gas canisters and explosive ones
stream is getting behind again
die
BronyForLife: uh thats standard lag for Phase4
standard lag..
00,02is it buffering?
BronyForLife: he lives in australia thus delay
on and off
00,02i'm in aus so its probably causeing problems with mips
Ah austrelia
Phase4: no it show the stream for me but i dont knoe if i am late in it
?
00,02G'day mate
why are you BUFFERING
00,02trying to clear the lag
'Cause he lives in Auestrelia
00,02should be ~20 s now
Austrelia
Phase4: works better for me now
why are you complaining about the buffering? it wont make it better people...
It's somewhat a reflex..
Like with a phone
IF someone doesnt hear you you yell, even though technology makes it sound at the same volume
ill be leaving now ill come back late- wait i can poput the chat
mooooo
uh-oh
i am back!!
Dat laughter.
boom
OH CMON
00,02i do not have enough ammo to do this without deaths
Non-lethal playthrough?
Phase4: DIE WITH STYLE
sneak past them Phase4...
no
ITS FAIL WITH STYLE
00,02Midnight_Tempest, cant now
shame...
Phase4: yeh thats the problem with non lethal, only 2 guns
2 guns but you supplement them with skills, like the cloak
00,02i might be able to from an earlier save
00,02yeah, i has no cloak
silly
the cloak is very, very usefull
and there goes the alarm
Hello everypony :)
Hello
Everypony is so active in the chat..
well the chat is kinda going
SLoooooooooooow
Thats with these stealth games..
nice shot
hmm, has phase hit the upgrade point yet?
stealth games are best games...
Im more for the assault
Or whatever sniping is
then you would die in this game over and over
In this game yes
there is more to gaming than everything being a CoD clone...
(L^-^)L waaaoooww so so eeettttiiiiaaannncccceeee dddouuubbllee rraaiinnbboowwwsss
^
But CoD sux
Midnight_Tempest thankfully, CoD is a terrible game
cod was okay
Only decent FPS are Bf and Tf2
until mw2 and so one came
emphasis on the 'Was' there Cow
yet every game is pretty much the same as CoD...
Bf is realistic
..-ish
BF is boring
Chrysalis: k
bf is boring as well
gee I thought i was the only one who hated call of duty
Imo deus is boring
its just alot more tactical than other shooters
BronyForLife: hey hey, don't forget Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Serious Sam
Uhm yeah..
like i said cod was okay until they keeped on going
Midnight_Tempest you mean only fun hat simulator
HEY
they should have stoped at mw1
BronyForLife: deus ex isnt a game for people that have no patience...
Tf2 is guddd
MadSurge serious sam is doing a very nice job in the latest set
All games that valve made are good
Chrysalis: ah yes... right... hat simulator
keepin old style shootin with newer graphics
ThunderCloud: i was lookiing at that want to play it?
Chrysalis: :)
cow224 Eeyup :D
ThunderCloud: okay well send me the thing to play then
But you have to admit
In deus there is much less action
Halo is awesome
yeah, but i love that about the game
Ok
you have to think in deus ex
and you hate action pacted games
CoD and BF you just run and gun...
I loved halo 1 and 3, but im severely dissapointed in 2 and 4
thats what i like
you can run and gun deus ex, just a differebt sort of playstyle
so just different opinions..
i dont hate action games, they just get repeatative
What's with the OC desktop pone?
Chrysalis: what's the ending of halo 2
thats phase4's OC
LAWL
logics
thats why i hate it
cow224 and neither can shoot
and love tf2 :D
Chrysalis: yup
theres so much spray in that game you never get good, yuou just get lucky
whatever... TF2 is ok, but it isnt that great...
Because theres no stealth..
cow224: and a knife to the foot is instant death :D
Well perhaps spy..
MadSurge: haha yup
yeah, but the spy sucks
DUN DUN DUUUUNN
/me hates spies...
im more of a scout player
i hate scouts more than any other class
My vision is augmented.
Battlefield: Where you can get in a plan faster then rainbowdash and jump out like there is nothing
so pretty much everything with an s
lawl
there friggen drinks are OP
Midnight_Tempest: then play scout, noone is good with all characters :D
especially with pyro..
00,02GODDAMNITSTUNGUN
heey pegadrome
is that the song?
and honestly BronyForLife i just hate current gen shooters... it doesnt matter if they are like deus ex, or doom, or quake... if the shooter is the same as every other game in its series, its going to get boring and sucky
this is why i dont play CoD, or any BF games
All games suck after time
I mean Bf3 sucked
Everything from WaW sucked
BF1942 is still the bestest
Thats going to happen with everything
and halo... well... halo ended for me at halo reach, the game is gonna go to shit with halo 4
serious?
perhaps a reason why valve never makes a third game
Midnight_Tempest know that feel, i was excited for 4 up until they actually released footage for it
Halo: Takes skill to actually get a kill and there is know lame perks or killstreaks
Simple as that
lawl
Tf2 needs team
cow +1 to that, killstreaks and perks are terrible
And THATS what i love in games
although, deathstreams are worse
Chrysalis: i never saw anything on it... just some comments from Yahtzee and masterchief wearing a new hat or something
i really fucking hate deathstreams
Chrysalis: I know right
what kind of shooter thinks its a good idea to REWARD someone for being shite at a game
if you suck you should lose, dont try to boost weak players all the god damn time
never gonna happen
Why
Others need to learn to y'know
BronyForLife learn by getting better at the game, not by getting an advantage
Im not saying i boost them
worst offender is damn second chance
whoever thought of that should be stoned to death
I just say things they should do
lol borderlands?
Things like not dying..
I know And people say cod games are realistic REALLY IN REAL LIFE SOME ONE CAN CHANGE CLASSES LIKE THERE IS NOTHING EVEN THERE dumb*** people no matter what NO game will ever be realistic CAUSE IT IS A GAME unless you can like transport your body in it then they can talk about realizem
thats not a competitive shooter
Games are never realistic
Its about how CLOSE to realism it is
bf is the closest
I know right but people still fight about it
BronyForLife: they can have a realistic aspect but real realistic? nope
CLOSEST
games arent realistic, so why do people take them seriously?
...
sure not even by half
BronyForLife the original steal battalion did a fiarly good attempt
you lost your save if you died in game
NO GAME IS REALISTIC
and you lost it if you retreated too much
thats my point
oh god... steel battalion... THAT DAMN CONTROLLER
SO HUGE!
that controller was amazing
it was awesome
picked up 1 rockets
wooo lets bomb this place!
i never knew what half the buttons did, but i did find the windsheild washer button
hah
you actually had to start the mech in sequence as well which was awesome
and there was a button for everything
yup
http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/06/mwofrntview.jpg
Razer concept?
DeadpoolDash: thats pretty awesome
for Mechwarrior Online
wow what is that
never gonna play another 360 game though... i need to just sell my 360
but
theres no buttons
no switches
no big "Ka-Chunk" things to press
Do you need to pay to play online with Xbox?
hate touch screens
it has buttons and an integrated touchscreen
i havent used my 360 in over a year
so mature to say that
it has 12 of what look like soft-touch buttons
screw those
i need to get an old steel battalion controller... and make it my joystick for mech/flying games...
i will find a way to do that...
die
Dat pose
Ok i pretty much lost what were talking about
Midnight_Tempest it wouldnt be too hard
the original xbox just used an oddshaped usb for the controllers
just need to get drivers
and a bigger desk
Guys, whats the problem with game consoles!
Hiya everypony.
Hey Cherry
game consoles have made gaming more streamlined and shitty, thats the problem with them...
BronyForLife: well for xbox there is two ways you can do it 1: You can buy the cards fr months and just renew when it expires Or 2:Pay a monthly fine for it about 7.99 do so if you want xbox live you should do it of the cards and not pay through credit cards
the more games become mainstream
the dumber they get
Wow
2: pay
I stick to ps3
cause the general public are idiots
i dont even use my PS3 anymore... PC is the only way to play games
better pics http://www.razerzone.com/artemis
I use ps3
its made to play
So i dont need to go to the store to get a new graphic card..
Trust me xbox is alot of money
BronyForLife yeah youll just get stuck with aging hardware
but i still have ps3 as well and play it online
i dont have to either... but i will eventually and then no game will be out of my reach, though most arent anyway
00,02like a ninja

You can even use the super awesome transparency
Vordox: The limit is 512kb now
Tested it
What is the server ip*
XAX even worse then :P
Vordox: Why? ._.
Epic song is epic.
XAX: High Definition

FUN FACT: PewDiePie has confirmed on Twitter that he's scared of stop-motion animation.
Spell-of-Gaming: meh
Spell-of-Gaming That sir was defenitly a fine twitt! :D
04Pewdiepie has to be the most renowned LP'er on YouTube right now
04In less than 24 hours a new video of his can get over 500,000 views
Ghosties: Swedes :P
Not to mention, Amnesia(One of the most well known game) got him a good stat

Vordox I am Swedish, and you are going to LOOOVE UUUUS!

04I don't find too much enjoy enjoyment out of his videos, but he does LP a lot of obscure titles and especially horror titles
MasterBoss43: errr no, I hate the most of the swedish common people =P
Actually, PewDiePie's first LP is MineCraft.
Ghosties: There's one thing I really love about him, his montages
Buck you Vordox.
(The reason I found him, due to having seen Criken having the same style)

if its really bad Quicksilver you may want to call an exterminator so you dont get owned by wasps
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh that didn't work
Nope still explodes
i want this rocket to work :(
I have killed a lot it must be a huge nest I will probly have to get a pro
I think the problem lies in the friction atm
well, that was unexpected
You know, the Nazis in WW2 tried a similar approach to VTOL. It didn't work then either.
make the sideways thrusters diagonal in a spiral IT will give it a foward pus
*push
they didnt have kerbal sacrafices to test on though
Phase4: My bet is in something causes a ton of friction when it gains too much speed
I think puting some rockets like this \\\\\\\\\ aronud the side would work
12O.o
Thats what im saying
go baby go!!!
YES
OMG
lol
IT WORKS
He did it
!
:O
11,02!

MadSurge: yes indeed :O
Ghost30k: One thing is stream delay and he lives in Australia so delay is to be expected
killerpony7733: I know very little of Starcraft though .__.
MadSurge: i played through SC2 three times or two idunno

THIS is doomed from the start.

Ghost30k: thats just a general stereotype people use actually :D
so how much have you watched Ghost30k ?
Ghost30k: No. We love and tolerate. And snicker behind their backs because they don't know what they are missing.
killerpony7733: it just makes me look in sympathy how people are so judgemental and they haven't even watched one episode
IT TOOK OFF?
killerpony7733: not sympathy, more like pity
00,02hmmm

XD
Kencolt: Close enough, I remember a story, that was famous, that a old woman with bracers could detect a Radio transmit and she could hear it, which resulted in an arrest. XD
good morning everypony
Vordox: The other was the idea that Soviet agents were secretly planting transmitters in out denture work to spy on us, both popular Cold War theories back in the day, radio denure work. I gew UP during the Cold War.
THEY LIVE
Irish_Pony: :D

I know them. Borin in 1957. 54 years old. Yes. I BEEN there. And the woman arrested? Didn't actrually happen.

11,02The internet was founded in 2010, back when Season 1 of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic aired.
^
^^
YES
THIS.
is there voice chat anywhere?
Ghost30k: nope
awwww
11,02BronyState voice chat? Only with a BronyState Gold membership.
SuperBrony64: XD
how is my name in use, i havent logged in since yesterday...
Ghost30k: i kinda thought of having a tinychat for bronystate
do want...
SuperBrony64: O U
SuperBrony64, can you hear me now?
killerpony7733: not a bad idea
there is always skype
theres an idea
On IRC? Ghost30k , the POINT of IRC is TEXT chat that'sw not too bandwidth intensive-- at least these days.
Ghost30k: it's easy and simple you can use webcam or a mic really :)
SuperBrony64: Wanna know a secret? :P
killerpony7733: which i have both of
Spin, you rocket. SPIN
11,02Starflash: Sorry, can't see or hear your message unless you have a BronyState Gold membership. Gold membership includes benefits such as Voice Chat, Rules-Free, and Unlimited Stream Access.
killerpony7733: :#
*:3
Quicksilver: requires everyone to add each other kinda why tinychat is easier tbh
ok
/me has super Bronystate Platinum Membership :3
Oh. OH! I know! He really really HATES those misshapen little guys and is trying to kill as many as he can in tyhe silliest ways possible!
i got nothing
11,02You also get a special emblem next to your name to show you have BronyState Gold, which looks like this...
SuperBrony64: That professional.
SuperBrony64: can i give you my credit card details now, i would like 3 premium memberships
SuperBrony64: Can we buy it as seperate DLC?
I assume Phase is streaming?
Sx963: yes
Sx963: ye

clever bASTARD LOL
nvm
ANYPONY for some minecraft?
11,02d3rb: Sure thing :)
so is there a tiny chat that i can log into?
I think I accidentally bought Superbrony Gold...
lol
actaul, maybe i'll just give my bank details and you can choose how much money to take, would be safer
minecraft
:D
11,02You bought me gold? Aww...you shouldn't have :D
LOL
Bronysith: would like to but i run slow on it
:T
SuperBrony64: hey could you kick twilight_sprinkle ? it would appear its glitched somehow and still online even though i havent logged in since yesterday
Chrysalis and i have a dedicated minecraft server if anyone is interested
Yup, it's definitely Superbrony gold.
Ghost30k: i got a room i could techinally link you :)
killerpony7733: please do

killerpony7733: :D
[BS]SuperBrony64: thanks
Ghost30k: But... nopony will be there.

wtf its stil lsaying its in use even though its not <.<
Did anyone else notice the error on the newsletter?
ok
Quicksilver: s4.cloudcrafting.com:7054
Phase4: You know, maybe you should just rethink your design philosophy? Becaue, I dunno... it kinda seems to be... well... NOT WORKING?
Kencolt: i know what he needs....MORE ROCKETS
00,02Kencolt, nah
00,02physics is wrong
aw
Phase4: There's a reason NASA didn't try this.
I'm in
Phase4: screw physics, I have rockets
Phase4 VS Physics
if you are trying to helicoper it, your engines are backwards
Phyyyyysiiiiiiiiiiics!!!!
Phase4 Come on. It isnt rocket science... oh wait.
Kencolt: cause nasa is boring, spinny rockets is fun
that rocket eject was clearly part of the plan
/me acts silly.
Phase4: Now, if you could link six Pinkie Pies to those wings/foils, THEN it would work. Because by definition physics would be automatically screwed.
[SB]Starflash: Such a SHILLY FILLEY
SPIIIIIIIIN
lol
I cant help it... It's because of [BS]SuperBrony64
Aw crap
/me acts silly.
SuperBrony64 :|
:D
BS is RIGHT.
[BS]SuperBrony64: To see this comment, buy BronyState platinum, today!
NEVER saw such BS.
Iiiiit's Kerbal time!
Allo everypony.

Meanwhile: HEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOO
Holy crap what the hell is that supposed to be.
Hello Meanwhile
To see this comment, open your eyes, look up to the sky
Meanwhile: hiya
Meanwhile a moonrocket
Well. I don't know if that was meant to happen but it was bloody hilarious.
00,02why my engines no work
lol they survived :D
how high do you need ta go
Meanwhile: Actually, it's Kerbal Murdering Time while Phase4 tries repeatedly to defy the laws of aredynamics, but that's ok.
Kencolt: Close enough.
Ghost30k: no requirements
00,02i have to go to bed now
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
LOL
Phase4: You're really just going for giggle points here arent'cha.
Phase, your engines are pointing backwards
aw i wanted spinny rocket :<
00,02Meanwhile, yeah
00,02if i wanted to go to space i'd go to space
00,02got that figured
Good man. Giggles are something I can appreciate.
Is that a Phase4 DTP in the corner? Sure SEEMS like it.
It is.

Oreos are pretty good cookies. :$
Cookies? THEY-ARE-OREEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOS
/me kicks MadSurge
Ghost30k: I think you will find, that except for Brony Movie Night, and the occaisional special plan by the mods, whatever streams here-- if anything-- can redefine random.
Anypony planning on attending Oni Con in Galveston this year? I'm thinking about sharing the beach house with up to 2 - there's 3 bedrooms
so how do we get another thing playing
/me is kicked into a not-so-bottomless pit :D
MadSurge: damnit, i told them to dig to the other side of the planet!
anyone read that fic "My Little Dashie" :3
everyone has. except me
twilight_sprinkle1: did you want to send me to China? :D
READ IT}
twilight_sprinkle1: same here
Ghost30k: Whenever a mod decides to stream something, It's at theiir whim. And you never-- NEVER know what that will be outside of scheduled streaming.
oh ok Ken
twilight_sprinkle1: didn't read it either
MadSurge: hmm, that depends on where you live, it should be the opposite siode of the earth from there :D
its fucking sad
save someone a few hundred in hotel costs
made me cry
hm, maybe i should read it, i mcurious
i always say i'll read it but never get around to it
death is a cheap tear-jerker though, so if she died thatl be boring
twilight_sprinkle1: maybe New Zealand :$
^
d3rb: yeah me neither
Ghost30k: You can be assured of two things-- at one time, your mind WILL be torn from it's roots and dragged into the vfery pits of chaos and madness. This is also known as Whenerver Shizuka gets bored. And two, there WILL be at tome point, SeaPonies.
well if you don't want a massive hole in your heart don't read it or you'll uncontrollably cry for days
MadSurge: well, lets find out!
meh... we'll get around to,its not going anywhere
/me kicks MadSurge again
If I where to dig to the other side of the world I would... Die from the high pressure and temparature.
/me ends up on Mordor
MadSurge: wow, i overdid it, didjnt i :D
One does not simply dif into mordor.
twilight_sprinkle1: aye :D
Vordox: forgot Wrek?
killerpony7733: Wrek = art/music/D3
LEE ROY
... THE EXPERATION DATE ON THIS MILK LIIIIEEDD!
killerpony7733: Wrek will be in vacation for three weeks :)
and now...we wait...
TheRandomkid321: lol
i know there making Season 3 but is Season 4 for mlp coming out?
Kencolt: Indeed, but Philosophy is based on random events that should be analyzed ;)
MadSurge: as if i didn't know :D
Irish_Pony: doubtful, he said hes not into games
twilight_sprinkle1: Never seen that show ever.
Ghost30k: it's a mystery
Ghost30k: thats quite in a while if theres going to be a Season 4
lol i heard that Season 3'd gonna end it
inb4 TheRandomkid321 getting sick and sitting on toilet for whole day
Vordox: well maybe not australian, but shows with people with australian accents, like that ned sports thing, or bear grylls
Ghost30k: Season 3 is the final season yes
Wait. Is milk supposed to taste like mushrooms? The edible ones?
Vordox: why they have such a strong fanbase
Ghost30k: No income. :P
Ghost30k: How many here have bought ANYTHING from Hasbro?
Vordox: oh
not me, not yet
With the connection to MLP FIM
i plan to soon though
:(
Good things aren't free.
i bought dvds
when MLP ends ill die
i want a twi plushie!
Vordox: I have. 'm rather pleased with my Ride Along Twilight Sparkle on the top of my PC desk.
But hey, S3 is may get continued.
^
Kencolt: Heh, shame alot of other cannot do it :P
Kencolt: do you have a pic?
S3 has only been ordered to do 13 episodes
i WILL buy a vinyl scratch toy
Not the usual 26
That says alot
WOW
LAMMMEE
they wont stop the money train
Money talks in this world.
Kencolt: whats a ride along anyway
If everyone here went and bought merchandises, ica n change.
it can
Vordox heres to hoping they are longer then /)
They arenät.
=P
Vordox: darnit!
Vordox: inb4 it's all two parters :O
Hey guys
MadSurge: nah,
but like everyone would have to pay thousands for them to turn an eyebrow for that
Wait... Season 3 is the final season? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eal4fep7pK4
Hey DarkStar!
Vordox: It's kind of cool. It's meant to be a motorised vehicle-- the headlights, handlbars,rearview mirros-- and the fact that of the three ponies in that small line, only Twilight has the SENSE TO WEAR A BUCKING HELMET is all cool.
Hey DarkStar
/me hugs DarkStar*
TheRandomkid321: it's all speculation.
Kencolt: Le...what lol?
Kencolt: i was the one who asked :D
You know what would be a good idea...?
A huge donation to Hasbro for continued MLP FIm...
Wonder how much that would do...
if MLP FiM ends someones gonna go on a mass killing spree
no need to donate imo
Ghost30k: No
Vordox: There are three. Rainbow Dash on a scooter-- and a cap. Fluttershy on a cart and a headband. And Twilight on a... thing, that's obviously powered, with a helmet. With a hole for her horn.
theyll get the money cuz the show is so popular
donate money to hasbro :P
^
Kencolt: ....Very weird but interesting design.
You know what
Screw it, I'm going to buy the Itunes now
Before too late. :P
The episodes that is
twilight_sprinkle1: It's strange-- it's a classic example of the Toymakes not knowing what the hand of the animators are doing-- but it still works, in a way.
so is it confirmed only 13 episodes for season 3?
Ghost30k: Yes
damnit
Atleast public domain
Kencolt: yeah, the hasbro plushies are a fail
Sigh. The Magic 65.
ok im gonna go make sure that these new skins I got work Ill be brb
I have way too much freedom during work hours :) I havent gotten a single call this morning - not that I'm complaining
But the movie will be interesting
MLP FIM movie
wasnt it 13 eps per studio?
<3 code geass music
since they use 2 studios?
d3rb: Do not know the details that well
hopefully it end up like Glee after there first season and make a shitload of money to continue the show
*their
twilight_sprinkle1: What I mean is, Fluters isn't going to be going fast enough to need a helmet, Rd, well-- like she CARES, and Twilight, of COURSE she thinks of that sort of thing.
i had a feeling that was the jist of it, but dont quote me on that
Kencolt: lol yeah thats true :D
yo
So who else is buying the episodes now? :P
twilight_sprinkle1: Of course, there's the odd part that she has a cat. That stands at the back of the vehicle. Who holds up a book. That you can actually OPEN-- that part too, is cool.
Kencolt: twi has a cat?
We should do it so that everyone here in BrS buys the ITunes episode
That alone would be like 300*Total Cost for all episodes
That alone is....alot
ERMAHGERD
MERFENZ
screw this, im gonna buy the season 1 boxset now
twilight_sprinkle1: The toy does. Like I said, the toymakers don't apparently talk to the animators that much.
d3rb: ...I want dat boxset :(
Kencolt: that would explain a lot
i'll take a picture of it when it gets here :)
Anypony here who has L4D2?
Kencolt: Since you have seen alot, you saw the early days of the internet? ;D
hey, australia needs at least one benefit, we cant get hd eps off itunes
twilight_sprinkle1: Yes. FOrtunately, a PROPER Celestia is coming to Toys R Us... which I can no longer catsh a bus to. DAMN.
Zombies are all the rage nowadays
if this generation of MLP ends then the their will be no more MLP. At least the one that we've come to love
Kencolt: Ask friends or younger bronies? :)
Vordox: Yes. Yes I have. And Al GOre did NOT invent it.
Kencolt: Heh, I know the story behind it
if someone else picks it up it will be like Halo 4, unpredictable and just not the same
Then Kencolt, have a memory lane thing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMLDrXe32c&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=2
Kencolt: maybe in a while theyll get their stuff together and start making good toys, they were probably taken by surprise by the popularity
<---What's "famous" about the internet
Anypony that want to play L4D2? :D
I got TF2 if you'd rather play that
Kencolt: If you checked through youtube you should know all of these.
Ghost30k: not installed and will take ages
twilight_sprinkle1: They aren't bad toys. They were, well, just made by toymakers thinking little girls. We are-- face it- an aberration, an anomaly, something unexpected by ANYONE connected to the project.
fuuuuuuuuuuu.....!!!! "Out Of Stock"
And... I have to go for now. Laters.
/me waves.
Kencolt: yeah, im the plastic toys are fine, but im still not happy with the plushies
laters Kencolt
bye...gone
I think i should give away a hat next week to somepony.
Who agrees with me that if Faust dumps MLP after Season 3 and someone else picks it up and tries to continue that Generation, it just won't be the same :(... Almost Like Halo 4
OH MAI GOD
HASBRO GOT to keep up
http://www.youtube.com/mylittlepony
Ghost30k: faust is already gone
<--- CHECK THS OUT

Tovler: more like "creepy for the sake of creepy"
compared to David O'Reilly, that was nothing.
he spent his life gathering bits of everything, then made it into a powder and smelled it
if you do LSD and watch that, it's just a normal boring "Let's All Go To The Lobby" thing
:D
that was stupid as hell
Irish_Pony: well, now that ive ben fairly disturbed...:D
Moopy well you're cranky today.
String_Shredder: exactly :D

Rainbow: Fine, fine. How about me?
Well, that was 8 minutes of my life.
hi

Tovler: that's just about all you can say about it
lol
Vordox: HOORAY
maybe it will air that day. it's supposed to in the fall thats all i know
Let there be bees!
http://derpy.me/MT5o2
String_Shredder: heck, the old don't talk about .MOV doesn't even need to be enforced.
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ISTHV2PUUBY/TroXV1lXPQI/AAAAAAAATds/vs_Y0oIYDzk/s1600/Capture.JPG
Tara Strong herself
HOWEVER
/me huggles FlareChaser
also, still only 13 episodes listed:/
This brings up a concern
, and Octavie were in PARTY.MOV
Ulthane: they're probably still working on the others
SWAG.MOV
String_Shredder what others?
Bronysith: fawck yeah
CCCP chrysalis in a dress? :O
Lyra, Bon-Bon, and Octavia were in PARTY.MOV
oh yeah, she was. I kinda forgot.
killerpony7733: yup
CCCP i would dance with her! :D
CCCP: Chrysalis Gala dress?
How can you know for sure that is Tara STrong Vordox? Any one could use that screen name.
lol
Barbetos|Atwork: Witnesses :P
Rainbow: eeyup
Ulthane: the other episodes. Just becuase there are only 13 listed doesn't mean there are only 13 in the season
Ulthane: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9AfQzsG4_A
Vordox witnessing what exactly? Its just a screen name
there should at least be 20
Rainbow: and a bunch of filler OC and other ponified shows :D
so...whos bored enough to read what I wrote for my gf?
me
...me
SEASON 3 IS ONLY HAVING 13 EPISODES?!
Hello everyone
Yup
Whats the cheapest smartphone? I want to only use it for 3G connection with my ASUS Android Tablet? I never call anyone.
NO Sith
well i got nothin else to do so lay it on us
hi Cobellanez
Bronysith: you didnt know?
That's just what they ordered so far, Bronysith. They might order more.
Vordox woah, that's a lot of "NOOOO"
Bronysith No. It has 26, they have two different places working on 13 episodes each though.
Bronysith: SEASON 3 IS THE END...of MLP:FiM.
But I think the 13 episodes are going to be of extream quality
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
FlareChaser: WAT!??! :'(
CCCP: They will. THey could be longer
Yes there will be, it will be airing in Fall 2012, I don't know when exactly thoughSource(s):Tara Strong (Mlp voice actor)
Yeah,sorry kids.
D:
And soon...we'll have....Care-State o_o
:'(
FlareChaser: YOU LIAR!
So
How about 13 episodes. But 50 mins instead of 25mins each one?
It'll air within the next 3 months
season 3 needs to have sea ponies before its complete
:3
needs more seaponies
FlareChaser: THEY SAID THERE WILL BE SIX SEASONS
FlareChaser: u must be trolling :'(
DAMMIT NO
Closest date I have is 17th September or later.
Bronies are too volatile to be told that Season 3 will be only 13 episodes.
NO, i want 20 seasons and 7 movies
hey kids
Season 3
is the end
NO!
:3
:[
sea ponies guys - i hope you're joking, one shoo be doo song is enough:P
pony_9491: I want 24 episodes, and 1 movie.
Don't milk stuff. =P
i think they need less season of MLP tbh, less creative ideas if you keep forcing a show... just look at spongebob
pony_9491: For the last episode they will probably make a movie.
FlareChaser the show may end, but PONIEs WILL FOREVER BE IN MY HEART!!
Why do you keep saying that, FlareChaser? Just because they haven't yet signed for a fourth season, doesn't mean there won't be.
Well then the show will be reebooted
/me battlecry
Does My Little Dashie seem like a good episode?
nope
we'll make our own show.
*Snuggles into everypony in chat for love and attention*
Braviary: why do you keep falling for sarcasm?
Braviary: There's a high chance that Season 3 is the final one.
Rainbow hell no
Season 3 may be only 13 episodes, but we still have Black Dynamite and The Boondocks to look forward to.
Ulthane: Why the hay n ot?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=wowy-EdU4Eg&NR=1 dat acting
Rainbow because humans
Season 3 probably won't be the end, calm your tits..
My gut tells me this is the final season.
jesus..
lol
06Everypony calm down. . .
And so far, I trust my gut, and I hate to admitit. ><
/me sits on VioletVanilla
Damn.
/me sits on Bronysith
now we have a totem pole.
We're calm VioletVanilla. :)
HAHBAHWAWWW WHYYY SEASON 3 WILL BE ONLY 13 EPISODES AND THE LAST ONE WHY WHY WHYY DOAWIDJOIJAWOIHDOIHOIj!?!o!=32902
/me ist being crushed. .
/me sits on FlareChaser
pony_9491: Reasons.
._.
/me pulls VioletVanilla to safety from being crushed
/me sits on Bronysith FlareChaser valoreins and VioletVanilla
Has Rob Renzetti actually left?
ow ow ow ow
Irish_Pony: Nope!
There's alot of reasons, VA, Screen Writings, Effective Ideas, Production Cost, Merhcnadise sales.
aww im left in the open..
was there an EqD post i missed or why is everyone talking about Season 3?
You nae it
There will still be bronies! We could all chip in to make an online version of the show!
VioletVanilla: you really have to be careful when these ponies try to make a pony pile :D
lol
/me giggles
Tovler about the same time as Lauren iirc
06I know Sylandest~
yeah we have all those brony animators
Dat pony pile ~
I am not good with sarcasm.
VioletVanilla: thats why we wub you :)
Ah wait... SB is probably asleep by now
/me shudders thinking of the Star Trek fanmade episodes.
VioletVanilla: At the ghosties?
there.
asks*
:D
Well.
End or not, I'm sure it'll be alive for atleast 3 more years
After that, it'll dwindle off to become a cult, and thereby only remembered by those who put thought into it.
After that...*Shrug*
Vordox: star trek and star wars has been gone for long time and theres still a massive following
Bronysith: Movies, Spin off, merchandise, connected with Star Wars.
Bronysith: Think of the connections of what Star Trek is and why it's still around.
Vordox: prequels never happened
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECx-42Wlho&feature=related this is how I wanna die :D
We're still having a conversation about this?
Bronies could make episodes!
Bronysith: It did.
seriously?
really?
LOL
everyone, calm the hell down, when the show ends it'll end.
done.
over
Vordox fandom should be alive for far longer than that, i mean SWAT Katz fandom is still going and that cartoon wasn't very famous in the first place
/me thinks about the fanmade video he saw recently.
Now talk about cookies.
who wants to draw pony? http://flockdraw.com/mlpfim
Ulthane: I am a fan of it, I remember it as well.
wow CCCP best death ever
Ulthane: Still I'll keep to say that it was meant for "the mass"
oh wait
The hardcore people, or people who bring up points, will drag it to light when in time of need.
But. The amount of people intersted in MLP will for certain go to another part that they find interesting
that was Irish.. great video :)
For the premiere of the new Spider-Man movie, I'm gonna improvise a costume.
That's how human nature is...bleh
Holla, everypony! :)
ohai GilDash
hey gildash

RaveBrony: Ah :D
Ulthane: Heh, it's not over yet?
FlareChaser: Are you Skeletor with your MYAHH
im working on it FlareChaser, dont worry :D i just haz the illness...
Ulthane: MLP FIM was a group effort of several people idea and enjoyment was put into it
Once a piece of the people working on it goes away, it's not "over"?
and eqd finally finds party.mov...
Ja~
/me hugs RaveBrony
okay :3
User0: several hours late :D
Hmm... I wonder
Irish_Pony: I think you're exaggerating with your medals. I'm sure that's a crime. :D
Mods are asleep?
Starflash: doubt it
06Letting everypony know, no links to party.mov or any discussions about it in main chat. Use PMs for this~
06I am not asleep!
Here is what eqd says about season 3 having only 13 episodes, that it is a LIE!!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/top-draw-production-board-includes.html
06How dare you think I am asleep?!
Ah, Vi <3
06c;
Vordox if they're replaced with people with the same passion focused on continuing their predecessors work, then no, it's not over
ok, not all the mods are asleep
Ulthane: We'll see.
GilDash: What? You do find it sexy :D
Sweet Cola have mercy...
Thanks to watching Naked Gun last night I just checked late Leslie Nielsons IMDB page. He's done ALOT of stuff.
http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000558/
Irish_Pony: I didn't say I didn't. :D
Irish_Pony: So i heard you like medals :D
status meeting time, later...
I can't wait until the Spidey movie comes out!
killerpony7733: sure? :$
HI :)
/me is dying laughing at PARTY.MOV
Also Ulthane ..
Leslie Nielson born 1926, started acting on tv in 1950
what do you mean "we'll see"? part of season 2 is free of their influence and did it go downhill?
Irish_Pony: Just sayin :O
Ulthane: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_AdxJWFUh4 <-- For you
About damn time. They showed 1-armed dr conner in the original trilogy but we never got to see the Lizard.
Argh
headache.
06headache?
06>:
Ulthane: This should be streamed. XD
06Here let me help you~
Vordox wrong intro! look up the second one;)

23 episodes i think
Hmm, I wonder. Has anyone here seen that classy costume drama yet?
Meanwhile: Hi
Hmm, okay. Obviously, LightIRC has a serious problem with invalid links.
LOl noteworthy XD
I found it the other day and loved it
FairysHuff: Yeah, he started out trying to be a serious actor, but every time he tried to play a serious role, the movie was either laughed at or did poorly. He met with more success in comedy films, thus the eventual Naked Gun movies and such.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PstCcgx-4AQ&feature=relmfu
Also I saw a Vivi~
GilDash: Hiya Gildy!!! *hugs you*

eyup
indiana jones
QuickThinker: If you can live up to it then its better :O
oh poo. I really didn't get the Newsletter.
in my personal opinion. Indiana Jones > Star Wars.
Careful that is blasphemy to certain people.
Jaws. LAWL!
Barbetos|Atwork: but I promised Ghosties that I would not mess with bronystate users ;)
yay, Jurassic Park
MakerDusk What? Is Kingdom the the Crystal skull bad? *troll face*
no
desire to mute rising :p
it was good
hello everypony....what is this? :D
Muted ages ago.
Magic Not... sure if serious...
I never found the last indiana jones movie THAT bad.
"John Williams is the man~"
HAylergerfuglr
d'aaaaw
HNG
Lasharus: not to mute the stream, to must the crystal skull fans
;)
Crystal Skull was missing something, I can't put my finger on it.
Oh deary me.
You know what? Flash is horribly unstable for me.
i liked all of the indiana lones movies
TomSka :D
is that Tomska?? O.o
i know that guy and his dubstep glasses ^^
O_O
Herro, peopre, what are we watching?
So while the way LightIRC perceives links is a problem, Flash is as well.
helly yeah tomska is streaming :D
wtf
Suddenly, Men in Black.
What in the limitless hells is this.

good late morning everyone
hi Dken2021 :)
heya Dken2021
You mean the sound delay of half a minute, give or take?
CCCP: well, damn
Oh heck yes!
Hello, Dken2021
hey Dken2021
08,01well, i guess that's another thing for me to fix
What the hay is this?
hi dken
Howdy Dken2021!
I still have no idea what that was. :P
aww, I was enjoying that randomness
AgentKalim a typical tomska video
:o
I love TomSk... No ho- okay maby a lil homo.
that was a tomska vid?
(if you're wondering it's my day off, and I'm so using it to relax)
eeeeyup
Is Tom Ska a brony?
well idk but the stream keeps derpin on me
stil not sure
MakerDusk: lucky...
MakerDusk: LIES! :O
i don't thinks o CCCP....
6_9
Elondras: well in asdf movie 5 he had Tombstone do the soundtrack
Dken2021 Obviously
CCCP yeah but that doesn't mean anything
grr. now I'll have to watch BMN so I can get the lottery-reminder email.
GilDash: yes, I know admins don't get days off, but I'm taking one anyways
deal_with_it.jpg
:p
CCCP Edd was a brony. Before he died from Lukeimia. Tom respects bronys.
Elondras: i know, but they also put a pont in asdf movie 5
TheRandomkid321: oh
:(
MakerDusk: You're not an admin. :S
GilDash: you might want to do a /whois on me ;)
look at the tags on Mineturtle: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BbQdlP4PaU
Elondras Eeyup
CCCP yeah but i still don't think he is a brony yet...
lotteries are on Fridays from now on?
Elondras: well he might be
That should be somewhat clear on TomSka's "brony status"
MakerDusk: say whaa?
Elondras: i wouln't be suprised if he was or not
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj8ycV7LuDA&feature=plcp
MakerDusk is best admin.

MakerDusk: Tsk, you've masked yourself. ;)
Also, I'm back from the point I left and didn't mention it.
haha, I'm one of the irc network admins
hi Meanwhile <3
/me waves to Meanwhile'
Howdy Meanwhile.
is someone doubting MakerDusk's authority again?
Is Ninjazz on the chat?
Hello, Meanwhile
hey Meanwhile
Dken2021: I think so.
Dken2021: I kinda hope you all do
Dken2021: Potentially. Silly for them.
it's not fun when you have to see me in action :(
MakerDusk please, everyone who knows you secretly fears you.
Meanwhile: you just made a sadness in my little heart
Hello
/me hugs MakerDusk.
Hello Ninjazz
Allo Ninjazz.
/me hugs Meanwhile while sobbing
MakerDusk: honestly i don't fear admins or mods but i respect them as people :)
HA HA! Fooled you all. I was Ninjazz THE WHOLE TIME!
Oh hey Party.mov is out.
What a twist.
Meanwhile: late to the party there

CCCP! Meanwhile! PARTY.MOV! :D
killerpony7733: Thought I might be, been absent for like 2 hours.
killerpony7733: come here you big suck up
MadSurge: i know
Vordox: don't have facebook.
/me noogies killerpony7733 ^_^
/me is noogied 6_9
XD
I haven't used my facebook in a long time
FaceBook kind of sucks
party.mov was meh for me compared to the others.
CCCP that's why I haven't used it in awhile
same
User0 :/ well that is sad
every time I go on facebook it's different
they change it way too much
I haven't used my facebook in a LOOOOOONG time. :P
MakerDusk: But really i know what mods and admins are for so i know it's the persons job they follow rules which they enforce when needed so i respect them at that point :P
Elondras: at least he is pony-friendly, and that's good enough for me
I hope the world ends this year :P
CCCP that would suck tbh
CCCP but then no ponies
eh i guess
what? no! I have so many things left to do!
User0 if he is not a hater than it's all good to me too
haha, we do have quite a bit of rules to follow
killerpony7733: yeah i guess
Dken2021: ok your right there
though if we're explicitly given permission to power troll in a side channel, most of us will go for it
MakerDusk: Yes that is a fact, even having to keep professional at a point
Hey, who likes Octavia here?
Alchemist: party.mov? he made a new one?
Elondras: eeeyup
Hey everyone
Elrondas: its been posted on EqD not so long ago
MadSurge: Yep. ;)
hai Dermathil
Howdy Dermathil.
Hey Dermathil
MadSurge: i do like many others
lol
quick passingby question, anybody gots spare rubies in their terraria games?
GilDash: I was almost crying from laughter :D
killerpony7733: I go for a happy medium, though I've been working on that balance for ages
wow i hate it when the stream derps
MadSurge: It's true. I love Octavia. :)
if you're all professionalism and business, how could you enjoy the network?
my little pony, my little pony, aaaaaah!
MakerDusk: True but it has to be a certain level to balance it out
GilDash: Well you're lucky, she seems as good as her canon self even in that series :D
MakerDusk: You couldn't. That's why I hate formal business pracice to the nth degree. :D
MadSurge: Pretty much. :D
WUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUBWUB
killerpony7733: yes, thankfully my actual job helped me there
wubs
MakerDusk: Notice how i can talk a relatively normal conversation with you, Even knowing you got the power to smite me to dust :D
She cleans them with... wubs.
GilDash: I love Pinkie, but these characters are so different that they're pretty muych other characters. This Pinkie is so miserable :D
/me is a programmer, and should be working right now... (ping to MakerDusk)
haha, I might have the ability, but the rules are clear and it would only hurt the network for me to do so
Wonder how long until that RD mov.
MadSurge: They're all so wonderful, aren't they? :D
I suppose I should be writing a program now myself, User0
need one to calculate airmiles on my calculator
epic wub time oh yeah
since I'm getting tired of doing it by hand everytime
GilDash: Aye! In the end I like more Spike, Jappleack and Fluttershy :D
MakerDusk: I'm actually at work... like my boss is within eyeshot (CEO is not here today, randomly...)
but I need to do a quick refresher on C
oh, lol
XD
MakerDusk: I also have RD on my desk and a brony wristband on - no shame
place is littered with rainbowdash posters
GilDash: How can Pinkie lose so many fluids and not die from dehydration :D
MadSurge: *That's* your only issue with the whole thing? :D
MakerDusk: pics?
Alchemist: your right...Party mov isn't that good...
you're*
GilDash: I'm a weird minded guy :D Of course all of it is messed up!
>implying any .movs are good
MadSurge: I just like to point out that trying to focus on any one thing in a series like that is pointless. :D
CriticKitten: Hey, I like them :(
Hey, it's opinions. :P
I like them too, personally.
I liked .mov when it was shorter and more random.
GilDash: the blog is the only "plot" the series really has :D
I do not have a camera or cell phone at work
That being...apple and shed I suppose. Don't mind the tumblr though.
.mov's are a lot like a censor-free ren and stimpy episode...ugh
MadSurge: Eh, I don't really read it.
MakerDusk: all that power at your finger tips? :D
:p
I never did see the Ren and Stimpy reboot on SpikeTv.
Dken: Except not as good.
I did see Stripperella though.
killerpony7733: had more fun when I worked for verizon
GilDash: In case, I'll give you a quick resume when SWAG.MOV rolls around :D
if they bitched at me, I'd break their internet
MakerDusk: there are other jobs related to AE which don't physically work with the actual accounts...
MadSurge: Fair does. :D
MakerDusk: in a sense you could litterally destroy someones life if they really made yours bad
...
Tovler it's alot like a typical episode, only censor-free

I suppose I could, killerpony7733
a couple of clicks and I could destroy someone's life for the next 7 years
And then MakerDusk turned to cybercrime.
MakerDusk: also, I have a rather large code database (upwards of a million lines without comments) at my fingertips, but that doesn't mean I can't bring in a flash drive....
That'd be impolite of you MakerDusk.
And then Shadowrun happened, the end.
to say the least
Hackers.
And why seven years? That seems curiously specific.
yet people still call in and yell at me
MakerDusk: Still despite that power, Wouldn't it be harder then heck to actually do it since it could be easily noticed?
Stream still down?
Eh, I work in customer service. I could make people's lives a living hell if I so choose.
Lasharus: that's the lifecycle of credit bureau reports
"Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm seeing a debt of 40000 euros here in the system."
"Needs to be paid before wednesday, of course."
Lasharus :D
oh no, there's a way around that
Lasharus: soudns like a troll job to me atleast if you were a troll
I'd probably get fired for pulling a stunt like that. :P
Lasharus, you monster
Some people deserve it. :P
if CMs are really stupid, we'll do as they order us and let them destroy their credit rating
"Why do I have to pay my debt!" "Because... you loaned money. That's sort of the point." "No I don't! I'll complain about you!"
:/
I actually had a formal complaint from the guy because he was angry I told him that he had a debt he had to repay. The fact that he'd missed payment on at least six terms in a row was a hint...
but in all fairness, I enjoy my job
MakerDusk: chainsaw of natural selection, financial edition?
MadSurge: *That* Pinkie though? :D
Oddly, the complaint had no repercussions.
Lasharus "sure! my name is *calls the name of another worker* good luck with your complaining"
Lasharus: Dodged a bullet there huh,
Yeah. Luckily my employers aren't idiots.
And I don't hate my coworkers enough Elondras.
GilDash: that's what I'm saying, *that* Pinkie is really gross :D
haha, I got an email yesterday
Lyra everywhere I drive? Do want. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lyra-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic-Decal-Vinyl-Sticker-/120936295621?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1c285d6cc5#ht_600wt_952
MadSurge: I'll let you take the flak for that. I've already got enough problems. :p
so I got a scan of the letter
was a huge ego booster >_<
Neat. :P
Barbetos|Atwork: Nice. All they have is Lyra at the moment?
GilDash: you're the local no-good here :D
One of my coworkers had a lovely day there. I was sitting next to him when he was being taught the ropes.
MadSurge: Not by design! :D
What happened? The customer praised his service into the high heavens.
also, dawww the puppy went into an ac coma
AttackWithHugs scroll down. It is a whole store.
I know a guy who makes decals - he owns one of those machines...
Ouch.
lol
fail
Ah no video
Rather.
yup
He didn't make it in the end.
I'm not even finished with my own training though, so I shouldn't talk TOO loudly. :P
Barbetos|Atwork: One of every one for me! (if I had the money)
the puppy looks so adorable, but if I pet her, she'll wake up and want to go out
catch 22 here

08,01Lasharus: SPILL ALL YOUR SECRETS, SECRET PONY
All my secrets about what?
Lasharus: and where do you work?
08,01everything!
MakerDusk: Government - education department customer service.
oh no
AgentKalim: Is that a goo thing or bad thing?
good*
ah
I essentially handle questions about everything from signing up for a new study to paying back loans on study financing.
I don't know... yet. :P
brb
haha, you call the number on the back on your amex, and you could end up speaking to me
One customer had a debt of over 150.000 euros. Built up over 4 years.
08,01User0: it's okay, i'm no longer hungry
I'm still astonished as to how he managed it.
08,01Lasharus: bloody hell
Yeah.
08,01on his credit card?
Lasharus how, he must of had a stupid amount of creditcards etc
No, for his studies. We handle loans for education, study financing, etc.
We don't give a toss about credit cards, thank god.
08,01Lasharus: oh
boredom sucks
But still, 150k? That's insanely high.
Hey, can someone please tell me how to enable gameserv in a room? I wanted to run a Roleplaying is Magic game through chat and I'd like a convenient way to roll dice.
Karaoke at least you have us :)
hey, AgentKalim!
true
Howdy, Karaoke
He'd have to have loaned the maximum amount, gotten every single form of credit and financing in the book, and even then it would be hard to get that high.
Another customer was just as intelligent. He complained about being sent to a collection agency for his debt.
He´d managed to not pay a grand total of 101 months. In a row.
The moment he returned to the Netherlands and supplied us with an address?
*PING* money please.
He really would've been better off staying abroad.
08,01well, i'm currently in abotu £20,000 of student loan debt
XD
I'm only 8k in the hole
The Dutch is a bit lower. I think it's around about 14.5k
I've only got 3000, and I intend to pay it off as soon as I've saved up some.
I don't want it hanging over my head.
I'm still shocked at how much I had managed to pay on my own
now I just need one more year
08,01we just pay it off as part of our tax, basically
08,01and we only pay it off once we're earning above a certain amount
:O
Oh we have similar arrangements.
08,01MakerDusk: the uK
Hurray learning costs!
08,01we need to start paying back if we're earning over £15,000 a year or something
If you have a loan, you pay off based on how much you've got in debt. If you can't support yourself along with the debt, you can request for your income to be measured, which may lead to a reduction in the monthly fee.
hmm, I suppose I could get an EU passport
Don't call me, I'm expecting you now.
wow damn youtube wont even play today
08,01MakerDusk: if you're an EU citizen, you'll be treated the same as a scottish citizen wrt student finance
"Hi, I'm looking into possibilities for getting an EU passport." "Is that you MakerDusk?" "...how?"
08,01GilDash: maybe it's £20k? yeah
Thats a lot o monies
Lasharus: I'd be going through different channels
08,01MakerDusk: curiously though, if you're from England, you get a lot less student support
since my family lives there on my mother's side
I know. I wouldn't handle passport requests, completely out of my area of government. :P
hungary
08,01MakerDusk: do you have dual citizenship?
I don't
but my mother and grandparents do
08,01you'd need to get it first, then you'd be able to get your tuition fees paid by the state, and get a student loan in scotland
well, one of my grandparents only has an EU one
she really shouldn't be in canada
>_<
08,01GilDash: yes, so true. and scottish people don't like the english. if you're from anywhere in the EU, except England, even if you're from Ireland or Wales, you get free tuition in Scotland
08,01if you're from England, NOPE
08,01GilDash: exactly
Scottish are pretty cool.
By birthright I'm Dutch. By mannerisms I'm British.
Suddenly stream
SUDDENLY OW
GAH
Suddenly, John Mayer
08,01i'm considering going to Sweden to do my masters
People keep telling me I'm "more British than most Brits"
Suddenly, stream blasts my ears.
Derpy! <3
dawwwwww so cute :3
ARGH! Oh. The stream startled me. I forgot about it.
Truthfully Scottish People don't like anyone
d'awwwwwwwww <3
08,01Lasharus: do you have cream tea at noon?
even other Scottish people
Lasharus thats easily enough done, most british are far more chav than british
00,03Hey y'all! What I miss?
08,01Sundaysmile: we especially don't like you, in particular
/me nuzzles Scoot-Scootaloo.

Scoot-Scootaloo: Ear bursts
aye we hate you too
Also, according to some, my accent sounds like the queen's.
08,01Sundaysmile: i'm kidding, we love you. maybe a little... too much...
lol
Ohai Scoot-Scootaloo! :)
Chrysalis: You'll find there are hardly any "British" British these days. It's a stereo type, nothing more. :)

I'm quite fond of it though, so screw the complainers.
Heya Scoot-Scootaloo
Helloooo, Scoot-Scootaloo

...Tovler - What.
GilDash i resent that, i shall write you a letter
Hey guys. Remember when i fooled you all in to thinking I was ninjazz?
Hello, Scoot-Scootaloo
08,01Chrysalis is straight out of an Alan Bennet play
Mmurica
08,01that's how english he is
TheRandomkid321: i somehow don't
Chrysalis: I shall have to go queing in the post office, but you'll find my letter with you by Friday. :)
On WoW, I was recently called "The server's very own Stephen Fry"
friday? this damn post service, always late
08,01my favourite flavour of gum?
08,01Twilight Sparkle.
wont get here by next week most likely
so i shall drink my tea in anticipation
Sorry, but can't beat Stephen Fry in Britishness. For me, at least.
actually... i am drinking tea right now :S
How does Twilight Sparkle taste?
I still cannot sleep. I'll try again in half an hour.
08,01MadSurge: it's an Ask Princess Molestia tumblr joke
As am I Chrysalis.
08,01it's raining here
08,01i win
Chrysalis: (\
Chrysalis: I shall have my butler send me a cup. We could have a little social gathering if you'd accept?
How just asking. How do you register your name?
08,01lets go down the pub and drink bitter
08,01the ladies may drink pimms
I'll stick with a lovely cup of tea.
so dinky is officially derpys daughter?
Earl Grey or Ceylon.
08,01Lasharus: you can have a lemonade
I wish
Hmph.
Earl Grey any day Lasharus
/me is in :p
Chrysalis: Absolutely spiffing. :)
08,01noteworthy: I WANT TO LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE
Ceylon's not too bad Chrysalis, but I'm inclined to agree that Earl Grey's great.
/me 08,01hates the rain
Dat theme
What just happened and oh no. the tears...
00,03Am I the only one who thinks this music is overrated?
08,01i don't like Earl Grey
Awww sad music :(
I wanna hear the Save the queen now...
^
but the sun is so hot
08,01bergamot gives me an upset stomach
Lasharus iv gotten quite fond of a lavender version recently
08,01i like Assam
have you tried it?
Scoot-Scootaloo: i kinda forgot where it was from
Scoot-Scootaloo: It is overrated, PLAY SAVE THE QUEEN
Chrysalis: There is a keurig machine within eyeshot and a endless supply of earl grey...
08,01and Lapsang Souchung
and I love tea, celestia damn it!
No, although currently I'm drinking Earl Grey Darjeeling.
What song is this?
Hnnnnnnnng this picture
08,01i like darjeeling
Why does the Queen need saving?
User0 that sounds amazing, far better than my current surroundings of a single tea cup, and about 15 mtn dew bottles
08,01Lasharus: is that just darjeeling with bergamot?
Diiinkyyy...Deerpyyy...
/me bawls.
Why must we give a bullism past to Derpy :'(
It's a mix of flavours, basically.
But it's quite good.
so sad :C
08,01i once had a boyfriend who tasted of darjeeling...
I honestly find this montge overly long and boring.
Chrysalis: this is why I love my job (yes I'm at work right now...)
Oh come on that's a low blow, stream
^
Chrysalis: and there is food galore too (along with other drinks as well)
We once gave her a cup of tea without knowing about it. She basically got stoned.
Hilarious.

03Sony DSC-H90 vs. Panasonic Lumix ZS15

killerpony7733: I got one of those one time :D
03the Sony was pretty nice, I tried it out at Best Buy
Irish_Pony: lol :D
03but apparently the Panasonic has a CMOS instead of CCD and someone said it takes better low-light pictures?
GilDash: That must really suck :S
...
<.<
Wow....
Om you can't argue when you see it you feel it
Om: Cursed with imagination. :D

Om: Yep. :)
02they both have CMOS
Oh Derpy :D
LOST
03no, H90 has CCD
02http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cyber-shot-DSC-H90-Digital-3-0-inch/dp/B006K552CU
Derp :P
Urgh, why does removing the spine from a dead fish have to be so fiddly.
02unless amazon is wrong
02XD
touched a nerve
:(
03I think they are
03as Best Buy and Sony's website both say CCD
02ah
No
it's a Principality
:D
Meanwhile: because it wants to keep it's spine?
EggWhite: It should have thought about that before it was delicious.
Communism ponies is now canon.
oh damn
uh oh
:D
02LOL it says on bestbuy's site it has CCD
That's not what communism is
Everypony. :3
Derpy is not retarded! :D

/me has the giggles
Dr Hooves: More socially awkward than Twilight Sparkle in episode 1
Shameless OC pony inserts.

03http://forum.digitalcamerareview.com/what-camera-should-i-buy/44826-trying-decide-camera-purchase.html#post87952
00,03NOOOOOOO :'(
great episode :D
Ditzy Doo. Well, Derpy for me :D
can't wait for more
hello scoot
He actually starts calling her Derpy later.
...who? *ignorant*
8-Bit TARDIS!
who?
Dat theme
dem desktop ponies
Derpy for me too kempa, i just said they named her Ditzy Doo, and the fans named her Derpy Hooves.
noteworthy: It's not
Just like DJ-P0N3 is Vinyl Scratch.
02tbh, if you're willing to pay the extra $20, the Panasonic Lumix ZS15 is probably better
I preffer saying Vinyl
now this is awesome
o.O
Vordox: i thought i saw the same ones on desktop ponies. they look the same
Derpy, Ditzy, she's still adorable :3
There's some jews on the table.
Well her first name was Ditzy Doo, but then the show itself start calling it Derpy too, you know?
Aww yeah
oh crap, the booty warrior
noteworthy: DR Whooves hair was 1/0.5 of pixels
More Boondocks!
Vordox: ah i see my mistake
Dken2021: Booty warrior. Lolol
Hey @Scoot-Scootaloo have you played SCP-087-B yet? ;)
I want you.
What.
AttackWithHugs btw, it was based on a real person, with the same name
Surprise butt fun
00,03Nope~
Awww yea, it's bacon time.
kempa: Derpy caught on first, but there was a huge rift when "Ditzy" was mentioned in Winter Wrap Up. I remember when she was called "Bright Eyes," anyway. :)
I think the hard way has a double meaning.
Dken2021: A real person...with the name of The Booty Warrior...?
Elondras: is it a browser game or an .exe?
Boondocks, with soundboard. /)/)_-
Yes homo

QuickThinker: Indeed but i for one do not approve of a single person with that much power to choose laws and everything
03so it would shut off every 10 seconds
03and there was no memory .card so I couldn't take a picture and check it :P
03though the only reason I liked that one was the 20x optical zoom, and these other two I found have 16x which is almost as good
03considering it still looks bad with that much zoom anyway
This is intersting... I'm wating for the Yogbox to boot
