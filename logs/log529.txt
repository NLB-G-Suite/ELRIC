That thing should be able to burrow underground.

But are you talking about actually having piloted an airplane?

Dat long delay
Guys. If guns don't kill people, people kill people. Does that mean that toasters don't toast toast, toast toasts toast?

DX1 traps were the most annoying to try and disarm...
dont buffer please dont buffer
I never used the frags. Made too much noise.
all the buffer
00,02brb
i loved taking on the mechs, especially when i knew i would win
eyup
that was always fun too
mechs were easy enough to sneak around
is it fun?
bosses were kinda rough, especially on higher difficulties
00,02i have 2 points
00,02praxis points
00,02Midnight_Tempest, i was thinking that
00,02i'll get the icarus
Lets him upgrade his cyborg implants
00,02i can move large objects
00,02invisible one is on the list
hmm
:D
00,02wanted to try the stun thing
00,02it broke
Thats why I go non-lethal. The challenge. I hate easy games
of course its easier... thats why there is an achievement for doing it without killing people, except bosses
Always play on hardest setting
Woah the delay is strong within this one
i should really play this again.. and go for those achievements
oh yeah... the stream is way behind
00,02flutterchu, image links are fine

The monologues do.
and you?
these guys play HALO
00,02dis is the boss fight isnt it
cant see were 2 mins behind on vid
2 min.?
a good mental arithmetic skill is not something I could turn into money...so it's more or less worthlless
not for me...the rest is out of limits
thats sad but to each their own
I'm as social as a brick
uhm
As have I
hm...sounds good
Do you have 4 eyes?
I have eyes on my chin
Aright
Lawl four eyes but

PLAY TF2!
why nooooot
cause he's playing DXHR
sooo whaaaat
the stream is just lagging bad
now he's not..
YAAY DXHR TIME
he has alot of games..

-_-
http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/deus_ex

00,02tell me if it starts to buffer

Woot

It's fun.
00,02i might stop before the bos
stream is getting behind again

00,02is it buffering?
on and off
?
00,02G'day mate
why are you BUFFERING
'Cause he lives in Auestrelia
Austrelia
It's somewhat a reflex..
Like with a phone
IF someone doesnt hear you you yell, even though technology makes it sound at the same volume
mooooo
uh-oh
i am back!!
Dat laughter.
boom
OH CMON
00,02i do not have enough ammo to do this without deaths
Non-lethal playthrough?
no
ITS FAIL WITH STYLE
00,02Midnight_Tempest, cant now
shame...
2 guns but you supplement them with skills, like the cloak
00,02yeah, i has no cloak
silly
the cloak is very, very usefull
and there goes the alarm
Hello everypony :)
Hello
SLoooooooooooow
nice shot
Or whatever sniping is
^
But CoD sux
cod was okay
Only decent FPS are Bf and Tf2
Bf is realistic
..-ish
BF is boring
bf is boring as well
Imo deus is boring
its just alot more tactical than other shooters
Uhm yeah..
like i said cod was okay until they keeped on going
HEY
they should have stoped at mw1
Tf2 is guddd
All games that valve made are good
keepin old style shootin with newer graphics
But you have to admit
In deus there is much less action
Halo is awesome
Ok
you have to think in deus ex
and you hate action pacted games
CoD and BF you just run and gun...
you can run and gun deus ex, just a differebt sort of playstyle
i dont hate action games, they just get repeatative
thats phase4's OC
Call of duty: Where the snipers run around and the guys with the machine guns camp
LAWL
logics
thats why i hate it
whatever... TF2 is ok, but it isnt that great...
DUN DUN DUUUUNN
/me hates spies...
My vision is augmented.

anyone want to play http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555 my ID is f8042e04e629f4a6dc0727db8d00bb5b5ac0582328506cf053c164fcaaff55c4
00,02GODDAMNITSTUNGUN
heey pegadrome
is that the song?
this is why i dont play CoD, or any BF games
All games suck after time
I mean Bf3 sucked
Everything from WaW sucked
BF1942 is still the bestest
Thats going to happen with everything
Halo: Takes skill to actually get a kill and there is know lame perks or killstreaks
Simple as that
lawl
Tf2 needs team
although, deathstreams are worse
i really fucking hate deathstreams
anyone want to play pegodrum my ID is f8042e04e629f4a6dc0727db8d00bb5b5ac0582328506cf053c164fcaaff55c4 here's the link http://futzi01.deviantart.com/art/Pegadrome-310648555
never gonna happen
Why
Others need to learn to y'know
I just say things they should do
lol borderlands?
Things like not dying..
thats not a competitive shooter
Games are never realistic
Its about how CLOSE to realism it is
bf is the closest
I know right but people still fight about it
CLOSEST
...
sure not even by half
and you lost it if you retreated too much
thats my point
that controller was amazing
it was awesome
picked up 1 rockets
wooo lets bomb this place!

>implying any .movs are good
Hey, it's opinions. :P
I like them too, personally.
I liked .mov when it was shorter and more random.
That being...apple and shed I suppose. Don't mind the tumblr though.
.mov's are a lot like a censor-free ren and stimpy episode...ugh
:p
I never did see the Ren and Stimpy reboot on SpikeTv.
Dken: Except not as good.
I did see Stripperella though.

Hackers.
yet people still call in and yell at me
Stream still down?
"Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm seeing a debt of 40000 euros here in the system."
"Needs to be paid before wednesday, of course."
oh no, there's a way around that
I'd probably get fired for pulling a stunt like that. :P
Some people deserve it. :P
"Why do I have to pay my debt!" "Because... you loaned money. That's sort of the point." "No I don't! I'll complain about you!"
:/
but in all fairness, I enjoy my job
Oddly, the complaint had no repercussions.
Yeah. Luckily my employers aren't idiots.
haha, I got an email yesterday
was a huge ego booster >_<
Neat. :P

08,01everything!
Oh no, Saturn is going full canterlock
oh no
a saturn is here
good*
I don't know... yet. :P
brb
Here's one I'm not supposed to talk about Saturn:
One customer had a debt of over 150.000 euros. Built up over 4 years.
08,01User0: it's okay, i'm no longer hungry
Saturn: that works.
/me nuzzles Saturn.
I'm still astonished as to how he managed it.
Yeah.
08,01on his credit card?
No, for his studies. We handle loans for education, study financing, etc.
08,01Lasharus: oh
But still, 150k? That's insanely high.
He'd have to have loaned the maximum amount, gotten every single form of credit and financing in the book, and even then it would be hard to get that high.
Another customer was just as intelligent. He complained about being sent to a collection agency for his debt.
He´d managed to not pay a grand total of 101 months. In a row.
The moment he returned to the Netherlands and supplied us with an address?
*PING* money please.
08,01well, i'm currently in abotu £20,000 of student loan debt
XD
That's pretty close to the Dutch average Saturn.
I'm only 8k in the hole
The Dutch is a bit lower. I think it's around about 14.5k
I've only got 3000, and I intend to pay it off as soon as I've saved up some.
I don't want it hanging over my head.
I'm still shocked at how much I had managed to pay on my own
now I just need one more year
08,01and we only pay it off once we're earning above a certain amount
:O
Oh we have similar arrangements.
08,01MakerDusk: the uK
Hurray learning costs!
08,01we need to start paying back if we're earning over £15,000 a year or something
hmm, I suppose I could get an EU passport
Don't call me, I'm expecting you now.
Saturn: I think it was 20, or 21k.
"Hi, I'm looking into possibilities for getting an EU passport." "Is that you MakerDusk?" "...how?"
08,01GilDash: maybe it's £20k? yeah
Saturn: Must be. :D
Thats a lot o monies
08,01MakerDusk: curiously though, if you're from England, you get a lot less student support
since my family lives there on my mother's side
I know. I wouldn't handle passport requests, completely out of my area of government. :P
hungary
08,01MakerDusk: do you have dual citizenship?
I don't
Saturn: i do :D
well, one of my grandparents only has an EU one
>_<
08,01GilDash: exactly
Suddenly stream
Saturn: Just don't go all nationalising off from us, okay? I don't think we could survive. :D
SUDDENLY OW
GAH
08,01i'm considering going to Sweden to do my masters
Suddenly, stream blasts my ears.
Derpy! <3
ARGH! Oh. The stream startled me. I forgot about it.
d'awwwwwwwww <3
08,01Lasharus: do you have cream tea at noon?
I have tea with milk all the damn time Saturn. :P
08,01Sundaysmile: we especially don't like you, in particular
oh yeah hey everypony :)
aye we hate you too
lol
/me has tea with Mt Dew.
like two people...
Mmurica
08,01that's how english he is
I still win Saturn.
08,01my favourite flavour of gum?
wont get here by next week most likely
I still cannot sleep. I'll try again in half an hour.
08,01it's raining here
08,01i win
Saturn: Scotland = Rain. We get it. :D
08,01the ladies may drink pimms
I don't drink, Saturn. Sorry.
Saturn: -__(\ Sorry, I don't watch that blog.
Saturn i say, its pimms o clock
Earl Grey or Ceylon.
08,01Lasharus: you can have a lemonade
I wish
Hmph.
Tea or bust Saturn!
Saturn: pub crawl?
/me is in :p
08,01noteworthy: I WANT TO LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE
/me 08,01hates the rain
Dat theme
08,01i don't like Earl Grey
Awww sad music :(
^
08,01bergamot gives me an upset stomach
08,01i like Assam
have you tried it?
08,01and Lapsang Souchung
That happens to some people Saturn.
Argh. Zombies. Islands... Holidays... Hothothot biini zombies.. argh
No, although currently I'm drinking Earl Grey Darjeeling.
Hnnnnnnnng this picture
08,01i like darjeeling
Why does the Queen need saving?
but we have timmies here
08,01Lasharus: is that just darjeeling with bergamot?
Diiinkyyy...Deerpyyy...
/me bawls.
timmies has best steeped tea
Why must we give a bullism past to Derpy :'(
Saturn: That's far too much tea for me. :D
It's a mix of flavours, basically.
But it's quite good.
could not leave the country and leave timmies
I honestly find this montge overly long and boring.
Oh come on that's a low blow, stream
^
And Saturn, it could be that you're slightly allergic to Bergamot. My grandmother was.
Hilarious.
ARG, how hard is it to realise, if a chest only contains cobble, put cobble in there
Saturn: I am laughing too hard right now. :D
dont put it in the other chest further from the entrance
