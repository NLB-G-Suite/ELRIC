Come to think of it, the Silence and the Weeping Angles work on the same principle. You can't safely let them out of your view.
Is brony still strreamin?
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz you are forcing me with that to invent a even mightier form of performing the art of hugging
TheRandomkid321, yes but nothing is moving

/me chuckles at Invi s remark
SuperBrony64: u still streaming my streams to have paused

/me give Invi his own radio station
/me gives Invi some nuclear rods :3

Alicorn_Prince_Shane maybe he fell with his head in his breakfast and is now drowning of milk :(
O_O
DuskStarshimmer: if u are there i had a shower so my mane is super clean now and u can climb up if u want
/me runs to SuperBrony64 house to save him
/me trips Radiojazz
It is just a possibility....
:C
/me destroys Alicorn_Prince_Shane with the power of Chernobyl
>:3
RP. Serious business.
It could be too that he baked a portal and is teleportlet to Equestria :)
/me is immune and deflects the power back at Radiojazz
No.
No you are not.
>:3
yesh i am
/me IS IMMUNE
/me combines radioactivity with Radiojazz and shoots highly intense gamma rays at Alicorn_Prince_Shane
/me dodges
Radioactivity is scientifically capable of tranversing through any sort of barrier except heavy lead.
In other words.
awww no crisis...bugger
ye so u shoot it at me
You're doomed. (Zecora)
/me run to the left
:)
i run to the left
No matter how fast you run, Radio waves travel faster.
radiation haz no homing beacon
i travel at the speed of light
hwo bout that
/me manages to uphold a constant ray of gamma ray laser and tries to aim at Alicorn_Prince_Shane
Doesn't need one. It is a wave of energy.
Oh you are just one hell of a Gary Stu you know that... :|
You're taking this "alicorn" thing WAY too far.
Alicorns aren't even that strong.
wats faster speed of light or radio waves
/me stops the laser
/me wakes up
They are just priviledge with special abilities.
anything on yet?
Alicorn_Prince_Shane it's both the same ^^
/me lands next to ponyloverforeva "nope"
Radiojazz, Alicorn_Prince_Shane must be a changeling that fed on the combined love of the bronies, then
radiowaves=light
NO
yesh
i am Bstate foal sitter lol
Daayuum, RainbowAsh! I would believe that! :O
oh well im gotta make a cloud muffin :P
:|
Alicorn_Prince_Shane :| I'm watching you
Radiojazz: one doesnt not simply kill an alicorn
One does not simply become an alicorn. :|
thats why celestia sent luna to the moon
ive always been a alicorn
/me facehoof
it was established by the almighty eightball
not kill but radiating *touches Alicorn_Prince_Shane*
yay MOAR POWAH!
/me makes cloud muffins and puts tray in cloud oven :P
/me absorbs the radiation
How one... Celestia did not send NIGHTMARE MOON to the moon by her own power. Who can tell me what she had to use in order to imprisson Nightmare Moon?
WaZaaaaaaaaaap!

that was 8 seconds
fits*
RainbowAsh radiation sickness is like a kind of infection
/me takes cloud muffins out of oven

omg
dam it
didnt work
Radiojazz what I've heard, i don't trust Celestia anymore.
ages?
ponyloverforeva sure ^^
have a muffin
Invi... You shouldn't trust everything you hear... Especially since Celestia in considered THE most misunderstood character in the show!
/me noms on fluffiest muffin ever :)
Do you know how hard Luna fans are on her?
how old are we all here?
RainbowAsh but you can't get it out of your body and it spreads... so i guess you are right ^^
ive tried making storm muffins once.....they turned out burned
Alicorn_Prince_Shane i used a gypsy portal
*ba dum tish*
hai everypony :P
im 17
Radiojazz yes, but what if Celestia just wants the power
hey Spell-of-Gaming
Alicorn_Prince_Shane 18
moin Spell-of-Gaming
lets say im younger than 18
Hi Spell-of-Gaming
ponyloverforeva: 14?
Im back let me guess he is a sleep? *sigh* We all know the drill from wtahcing wiggles right? 3... 2... 1...
ponyloverforeva i would guess about 15
yes
whats that sneaking SuperBrony64 up to?

ponyloverforeva: rly?

I suspect... CLOPPING!
And older than you, Shane.

Radiojazz: 21?
No.

bai ponyloverforeva
Cya ponyloverforeva.
Bai
Radiojazz she wanted to gain reputation. as you see on the canterlot wedding, everypony ignores Luna and at nightmare night, everypony fears her. so Celestia has the monopole of power
wait what?
c ya ponyloverforeva
why are you saying goodbye am i being banned?
Radiojazz i noticed it
pony_125: u said ur going to school
ponyloverforeva you said you were off to high school

I just don't like it when everyone considers Celestia an evil pony when she just wants to be loved, is all.
Good morning everypony! :)
moin RaveBrony ^^
Hey RaveBrony!
:$
but what if luna first went crazy on the moon alone?
Why the 'radio'ness? lol
I'd like to assume that she was just sleeping.
But... There's nothing that really proves any of that.
yup
Hi RaveBrony
There are a few things that can spontainosly kill someone... Im starting to worry.
SuperBrony64: i think his brain derped
We could also assume that it was Nightmare Moon going crazy on the moon while Luna was trapped inside NMM's mind.
TheRandomkid321 lol a few things is good xD
Radiojazz: Invi infected me! D:
RaveBrony: come stai signor piccolo
vrv ugh brb
RaveBrony: meldutta apres la porta?

Inb4 Nostalgia

Aye. Same here. ^^
I do wonder what is going on with SuperBrony64 though... :S
i'll upgrade my 1000kb/s Internet to 32.000 :) god, I'll get a speed flash...
sry i forgot the site to quickley share images
PLEASE TELL
Ninjazz i heard he is at his parents house
i has forgot
Invi: I didn't know that. :S
You know a phrase that I see a lot in fanfictions dealing with magic?
'Feedback Loop'
What does that mean?
I have a feeling that most of the time, it's used incorrectly
Usually the case.
You mean a Feedback Loop, Ninjazz?
Yes.
Very simply, Normally Input goes into a system and output comes out, right?
Yes.
still nothing? SHoudl we call the amberlamps?
In a feedback loop, some of the output goes into the input
Right... Yeah, I see.
http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Images/MacroscFig52.GIF
And a wild testicular pain appeared heh heh heh... ow...
and it can enforce itself to unimagined powers
Seiosly shoucl we call the ambulance... Does anyone know wjhere this guy lives?
I think a good way to see it is like in metal manufacturing, you use the shavings and left overs from production(the output) to produce more by adding it to the input.
TheRandomkid321 that's the information we all wanted to have. thank you for enriching our knowledge of your testicular pain.
*about
Hmmmm. Now I see.
Thanks.
Invi I get that response alot.
TheRandomkid321 i can't imagine why
Basically something like recycling.
Yes.
NOrmally, in output, there is waste.
A feedback loop can be some of that waste going back into the system to be reused.
HOWEVER
Seriously... SHould we REALLY call the ambulance.. Well I think he has died.. Mayby it was JEFF!
A feedback loop is not an effect of any thing going back to reapplly to the system.
If the input provides close to the amount the system can handle, then a feedback loop can have bad results, though.
So how does that apply to magic?
Like in Magic, it is not a spell arcing around and striking or effecting the user. That is something else.
I was just reading a story where it was used to explain how the spell was effecting other people rather than the person who was using it.
Ninjazz it's magic, it woks somehow ^^
Heh. :D
A better phrase would have been 'overflow' or 'seepage'
Right. That would have been a better word.
08,01okay
08,01so remember yesterday i shared a link?
No
08,01i'm going to share it again,and it will work now
I'm not clicking it first!
08,01i was having a play around with google's moog doodle, and did this by ear: http://g.co/doodle/6tyedg
hi.....
08,01hey ponyloverforeva
that sounds so silly ^^
Hello ponyloverforeva
moin Twi_Fi
What if you called upon the sea ponies... In the middle of the sahara desert?
Hello Invi
TheRandomkid321, they would all die.
/me wakes up "Meh... Sleeping dosent make ya more awake at all..."
Hey Twi_Fi!
Glad to see you're back with us, Airpuff. :)
moin Airpuff ^^
Hello Ninjazz and Airpuff.
Thanks Ninjazz >.< I needed a nap..
TheRandomkid321 maybe they come with buckets like seapony Lyra
You need some coffee. :D
Airpuff then nap ^^
SuperBrony64 still has made NO movement whatsoever... WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM!?
/me pours coffee on Airpuff
Invi: just did :)
/me runs around once more as the coffee is hot " Ninjazz !! IT BUURNS!!"
Airpuff but you just said you need one, so have another until you don't have that urge anymore ^^
:3
Invi: i said i needed one xD
/me while Airpuff is distarcted puts his d!ck into airpuffs sprite
Airpuff oh, ok *waddles like the awkward penguin in the awkward corner*
/me smiles at Invi thanks for the tip thou
:$
TheRandomkid321: ... wat?.. o.o
Airpuff Nothing... Heres your sprite
/me slaps the sprite away
Oh man I was gonna dick sprite him!
/me stares at TheRandomkid321 ..... "okai..."
Anyway... ON TO MY NEXT VICTIM!
......
:|
/me Elevates Like a skyrim dragon with wongs
gmorning
*wings
TheRandomkid321: ... wanna blow my trumpet? ;)
I'm leaving in about 10 minutes
Airpuff AH MAN NO WTB!?
/me giggles at TheRandomkid321
:$
Woodenfan i didn't notice you there. hi pony ^^
Well, I'll be back later today, it's nearly 7 and I gotta go to school
/me lands beside invis sprite...
Woodenfan: eew school >.<
TheRandomkid321 but i have no sprite...
Cya Woodenfan. Stay away from fires.
/me glomps TheRandomkid321 "No you dont..."
Oh fine then this coffe will do... AHHH GOD IT BURNS!
MY COFFEE! :O
Anyway, now ya'll know in case you write stories on magic that a Feedback Loop isn't what you think it is.
c ya woo.. gone
o.o
Right. I think they just used it cause the word sounds cool.
/me hoofs Ninjazz a new coffee
...WHO WANTS SOME COKE!?
/me sips coffee
Well it can sound cool and be correct.
Danke.
I know. But it was used in the incorrect sense.
/me glares at TheRandomkid321 .... "What are you scheming .."
You can use it in the proper context once you figure out what is the Imput, the system that processes the input ad the output
TheRandomkid321 no thanks i have my own special coke to uphold my PH
Airpuff what? See its not opened..
/me glomps SuperBrony64
wait
/me lift up a hoof "If thats the case i want one.."
/me hands Airpuff sealed can of coka cola
Airpuff no...
But its sealed? o.o
Go o open it...
Airpuff you don't know what he has done to it
Airpuff think of the possibilities....
/me shivers
Just ignore the fact that the coka cola logo is just a sticker
Y'all crazy. :$
/me sneers at TheRandomkid321 *opens the "cola"*
insanity is best sanity ^^
Drink...
/me drinks a slurp of it
THAT ISNT COKE! THATS URINE!
/me looks intrested at Airpuff
/me slaps TheRandomkid321
O_O
OW!
/me stares at TheRandomkid321 ... "oh.." *takes one more slurp*
>_>
Haha
/me bonk Airpuff with a rolled up newspaper
Airpuff well its not really urine... Something I flund while sneaking around he hospital... Tubarine or something.
/me uses Double slap against Airpuff and TheRandomkid321
PW!
OW!
/me it hits 2 times
/me stares at TheRandomkid321 ... "tubarine?" -.-
Yep well... I hope ypou got life insurnace buddy..
maybe it is just harmless desoxyribonucleinacid
/me flies awy extrememly fast
or not...
Or maybe it's just water. :$
or it is the juice of a giant yellow squid who lost a fight against a spaceship....
/me giggles at TheRandomkid321 "You know.. i never drank any of it?" :)
dat twist
Aw man... Well I guess Im going to prison now huh? Will it be prison or jail?
where is the difference?
In prison you get rapped
oh
then jail
I'd hate to get rapped about. I don't like rap very much. :$
Aw man... If it was an all mares prison I would want to go there
I mean Raped
lol Ninjazz xD
you sure it wasn't dihydrogen monoxide?
:|
Ninjazz ikr?
lol
There's one rap i find "good"
Beyond her garden.
xD
TheRandomkid321 even if you were made to a mare to go there?
Aye,
Wooden Toaster is good at that.
Invi nope
Some Tombstone's work too.
I like rap as long as it isn't angry or something like that
I like eminem
the prince of bel air for example sounds good
I prefer Hip Hop.
does anyone else smell gas?
/me passes out
/me puts on a small fire
ok, then he farted himself to death
You can wear fire? :$
Ninjazz yep, why not?
Hmmm. I see no problem.
fire is so fabolous
I have perefected cloning AH HA! So what did my clone do while I was gone?
he died
What else?
nothing else. he just died
hi everypony
moin valoreins :)
Ok... where is his corpse... We better throw him in a ditch somewhere
Hello valoreins
oh hi..
Hey valoreins!
TheRandomkid321 it vaporized himself with that gas that killed him
i will relax here for about 5 hours
oh ok.
valoreins nice. welcome to the club ;)
:D
SO did you fix the gas leak?
TheRandomkid321 there was no gas leak, can I else wear fire?
Well how did he die?
he fartet himself to death
anyone got an article about "how to think inside a chimney"?
oh... I do not belive that is possible but I dont have any proof against it.
valoreins I didn't find one at the equestrian inquirer, maybe they will report about that later
/me walks into corner and plays with rubiks cube
lol good
valoreins Fluttershy weaponized cuteness
Is it just me inquires about the reproductive esystem of ponys?
/me yawn.
why? it is a normal gender based reproductive system
Yeah... Nothing unsual about it. :$
Lol whats so wierd about it TheRandomkid321 ? xD
soeaking about fluttershy, 2 of my friends that i introduce to MLP just got insta-brony when they saw the fluttershy scene at the first episode
Invi well you never see any reproductive orgas so what. DO hey do it magically?
speaking*
/me sighs
TheRandomkid321: do you even see reproductive organs as you walk on the streets? -.-
xD
Will my grammar ever improve unless Im trolling someone with bad grammar? The answer is... no
Feels like I'm just jaded to Fluttershy's character.
Airpuff Do people on the street walk round naked?
TheRandomkid321: nope.
Exactly
the reproductive organs are hidden under the fur until stimulized
is that a theory?
-.- omg go look at a horse.
Invi. So what you are saying is... Al stallions are growers?
TheRandomkid321: Yep.
xD
i thougt ponies reproduce when a rainbow occurs, (see G 3.6 Over Two Rainbows ep)
Invi I do not
Same here... -.-
ok, what would be your cutie mark? /)^3^(\
Unless its somehow usable as clopping material fro my really bucked up friend is with me.
I have an idea that an Katana blade crossed with a saxaphone. That would be my CM.
And my friend just hit me for saying he was bucked up
Ninjazz you play saxophone?
My CM would be an atari joystick
Hey everypony
lol TheRandomkid321 .. if you want.. clopping matterial... with your friend.. i reccomend searching for it on.. google or something -.-
Ninjazz: why not combine it?
Nope. Guitar. **
Guys
lol
Saxana?
Hai Whooves

Hey Whooves.

/me fires lazor at cole
Airpuff... i think you may be metally unwell. How old are you again?
*EPIC DODGE*
O:
GilDash: if it will clear up the trouble, its a good plan. The last thing you need is a bank hovering over you all the time
Oh come on
Alicorn_Prince_Shane GEMA don't wantz me to watch it :(
Airpuff: What's worse, it's not actually a bank doing this. It's a building society. They're even worse with charges. :D

Sylandest: Exactly. I haven't used them in years, and it's only because the TV lisensing company decided to try and deduct more from me, despite asking specifically for a 1 year term, that this happened in the first place. :(
Alicorn_Prince_Shane it is censored because copyright laws in my country :|
/me kicks in stomach

hey Twilight
What is everyponyy doing today?
NOO! TAHT COSTED Me 50,000 BITS! ILL BUCKING KILL YOU!
O-o
Awesome valoreins ^^
Sylandest: That's just the thing, it was one fixed year. If I'd closed the previous accounts when I should have, I'd have just gotten a phone call from them saying that they can't contact my account. Which means because I have no account to charge. The problem is they didn't inform me this time, I didn't have the funds to pay them so instead it counted as a bounced check, which is a charge, putting me in auto overdraft. I didn't find out about this b
Lil_B but that's illegal
valoreins: wow! This is good! :O
wats wrong with TheRandomKid?
/me pulls out bowie knife
Pretty awesome, valoreins!
That wall of text
i'll color it laterm thx for the feedback guys :D

/me bucks TheRandomkid321 in the face breaking his nose

Lil_B using TOR to watch the video. I don't even know what TOR is but if it enebles you to watch that video, it's illegal ^^
Ninjazz I did not think that was possible
Sylandest: I'm already with Natwest, I just was too young and stupid back then to know what to do. I'd taken all the money out but couldn't be assed to close them. :D
SuperBrony64 back?
Ninjazz: I fear I invoked it by asking questions about it...meep...
Invi: nope
/me puts white mask on
Sylandest: Well, it's not a bad thing. ^^

AHA!
/me Tackles Airpuff
GilDash: Well I do hope things get better for you. :)

Alicorn_Prince_Shane oh, uh.. woops?
Ninjazz: Well, they shouldn't get worse for now. :)

GilDash: I don't think I got enough medicine for the marks. :$
Invi: Take Claude it's too dangerous to go alone
he's still dead? o.o
Claude but I'm not going anywhere
Ninjazz: I've got magic to take care of you if we get really careless. ;)
valoreins who is dead?
Dear princess celestia, today i learned that windows has no concept of security and that it is trivial to get admin privilages from the guest account. your faithfull student, Phase4
SB, who else?
Invi: you will need help if you are on the internet
I have a feeling SuperBrony64 fell asleep on the stream.
Phase4: HA! Really? :D
hello everypony
Phase4: Get a Deluxe Aniversary Account. :P
Hey LightTrooper105!
Run.
Phase4 it is windows duh. Celestia already knows that ^^
GilDash, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
o.o
NOMNOMNOM
Ninjazz: Isn't that the advice you should be taking? ;)
Claude the interwebz are a evil place
GilDash: Fire, remember? :$
/me give everypony Pie flavor Pie
Phase4: And this is why if a theif has your computer your precious user password don't mean shit. :D
Pie flavor.
LightTrooper105 but what flavour has the pie flavour in that pie?
Dat pie flavor pie...
Ninjazz: Fires burn out after a while... this one has barely even started yet... ;)
GilDash, actualy thats for different reasons
I wish i ahd a pie falvoured pie
Well, apple really isn't much better in terms of safty XD you can reset you Password per console with the second partition on your Hard Drive or even with the Backup CD XD
Phase4: Well, yeah, but it's still all because of horrible security oversight. :D
GilDash: I get the feeling if I keep this up I really am going to regret it. :$
Instead Im stuck with this icecream falvored icecream.
Ninjazz: I'd say really enjoy it. ;)
GilDash, this is privilage escilation, i can set it up so that next time you log in i get access to your account, and from there i can trick you into giving my code admin privilages
Invi Pie flavor
GilDash: Been told that before. -_-
Claude: x licking
Ninjazz: x Ninjazz
LightTrooper105: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvEoGzl7P1s
xD
Lil_B but you can't get viruses because they isolate from everything what is not related to the company ^^
Phase4: I'd like to pretend I know exactly what you're talking about, but I have basic level knowledge. I kind of get it though. :D
I don't that sentence, Shane. :|
like*
GilDash, the theif has your computer one is not an oversite, data is stored plaintext and anyone can read any of your data without a password assuming they have physical access
LightTrooper105 pie flavour ception much?
Invi yes :D
Airpuff :D
:D
/me hugs GilDash
Phase4! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
/me hugs Phase4.
GilDash Why do you try to attract every male you see? WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? Distracting us in order to steal the pie flavored pie recipe?
/me grabs 22. magnum rifle
'Dat pinkiepie flavour *-*
Phase4: I've no idea what you're talking about but I find it interesting all the same. :D
TheRandomkid321: Who said anything about male only? ;)
Phase4, most computer security fails if you got physical access.
Windows passwords are good when you're taking your computer to a social event or you're HAVING a social event, and you don't want other people just nonchalantly getting into your programs. It won't stop a haxor, but it will stop everyone else.
Invi but that on the other hand limits the user, and a well written virus will get arount (I'm talking mostly OSX here, not the iPhony stuff)
Ninjazz: You know you'd enjoy your time with me... ;)
GilDash: I do actually. :$
Ninjazz: So why so hesitant? ;)
Lil_B and that's why apple is crapple ^^
Just I'm scared at the same time.
GilDash everyone knows women belong either in the borthel or the kitching. Not in the security office... (joking joking calm the buck down)
...
TheRandomkid321: I'm not the one getting worked up dear. ;)
You're being unusually agressive today GilDash .. What gives? :$
Airpuff: She's pissed. :$
Scarlet, aus bronies rock /)
Airpuff: I have to make up for yesterday. I'm on fire. ;)
lol
Invi i still don't know if my next PC will be Linux or AmigaOS 4.1
Ninjazz: Yes, and that. :D
GilDash: Well its your fault xD
Airpuff: Only partially. :(
Hey Phase4
SHE AINT GONNA GET THE PIE FLAVOURED PIE RECIPE UNLESS SHE GIVES TEH SECRET PASSWORD!
GilDash: ahahha
Lil_B i don't even know amiga dingsda45.7
Airpuff: If people would listen to their own damned contract clauses I wouldn't be in this mess. :(
/me sips apple flavor tea
(\
...Is Discord happening on the chat? :I
did sb fall asleep while streaming?
Spell-of-Gaming a sort of. yes ^^
I still hope things work out in your favour, GilDash. :)
GilDash: .. ahaha i see x)
Ninjazz: I'm playing the game... in more ways then one. ;)
/me hugs Airpuff.
Phase4 we don't know
GilDash: And you just lost? :S
As far as the meme goes.
/me hugs GilDash back "Don worry it'll turn out alright in the end!"
Alicorn_Prince_Shane you so quiet
Ninjazz: I never lose. I cheat. ;)
Ah, no N64 games anymore?
GilDash: Dear lord...
the scret code is... ı ןıʞǝ ʇɹɐıus DECIPHER THAT!
Ninjazz: You know that you like it. ;)
Invi Amiga=PC from the 80's with one of the most modern OSs, Fans still mak new versions of the OS, it looks rather cool
Airpuff: I know it will. It's just crap it had to be like this in the first place. *sigh*
GilDash: My honesty is going to get me killed if I really do speak it. :$
there he is
Ninjazz: Killed? I'm not *that* bad... ;)
GilDash: know right unnecessery... but i gues it just "Had" to happen
Kony? WHO GIVES A BUCK ANYMORE!?! wait. HE LIVES!?
Lambo N64 games? where?
Anyway, Hey Bronystate! What's up?
Phase4 sure?
Lil_b: 3 hours ago. Banjo Kazooie
Airpuff: Well, it's naivety on my part. It won't happen again. :)
Hey Scarlet!
Invi, not realy
Scarlet: Holla! :)
GilDash: You have grown! You will never make the same mistakes again!
ohai Scarlet
D: and i missed it! i grew up with N64 D:
Hopefully x)
Airpuff: Exactly. :)
:P
Lil_B me too, even if i had only a few games ^^
Airpuff: Not that all my mistakes are bad ones. ;)
GilDash: i guess :$
SuperBrony64: iz u back now?
GilDash you can make bad mistakes?
Invi did you think some more about going to Frankfurt?
Invi: I work them to my favour in the end. ;)

Ninjazz: You can't stay balanced on that fence post forever. ;)
Invi: There's no escape xD

SHE WANTS TO GET THE RECIPE OFF AH AND... I never told the recipe to anyone did I HA HA! I was worrying about nothing the whoe time
Ninjazz: I'm not going to force you. Just coerce you. ;)

GilDash: Into what?

Ninjazz: Whatever you want...
/me if there were wings on me...
the helicopter pennis spin !!!
Heh,
Ninjazz counterquestion: do you really want to know that?
Right. Well, then.
Ninjazz eh you do watever you want now I know you dont know the recipe
WOOOO HHOOOOOOO
pony_911: Actually what in the hay? :D
what?
Invi: I'm always willing to explore. Just don't know how the hell to take the first damn step. -_-
btw what recipe any way
And...
Ninjazz make your brain shut up and do some shit ^^
TheRandomkid321, what the hell are you talking about?
The pie flavoired pie
Ninjazz: The first step is the scariest. It's all a relief after though. ;)
Invi: Like what?...
Hi Kids!
FlareChaser: Where's Octy gone?
ooohhhhhhhhhh im gonna steal that secret MMMUUUUUHHHHAHAHA
GilDash: shes still sleeping.
GilDash: I'm worn out already... From just thinking about it...
WHAT THE HELL TO DO.
Ninjazz: Do you want to take this to bed? ;)
SOrry but you look liek you have got the reproductive organs of a mle. You wont have any effect on me
Best time of day, off to school.
Ninjazz what like what? When you wanna explore something and don't know how, just make your brain be quiet and start doing something ^^
Xer[a]: How is that the best time of day? :S
GilDash: Gimme a second.
Ninjazz: You've got all the time that you need. ;)
bya Xer[a]
Invi: My brain hates me. It want me to do EVERYTHING and then tells me to stop right before.
/me sighs
Ninjazz: Throw a little caution to the wind. I'll pick you up if you fall. :)
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind~
Ninjazz when you are unsure about doing stuff, but you don't know how, just stop thinking and do something. in most cases it turns out to be right ^^
My image here will change for the better or worse after tonight...
I don't know.
Ninjazz: You know what you want. Don't let anything else be a distraction. :)
hehe im threatening TheRandomkid
GilDash: Argh! Stop tempting me!
Is now a bad time?
I need just a few simple seconds to catch my breath.
Om: You bloody freakin bastard!
GilDash: When you appreciate school and the time spent there, like I do, you come to realize that you like it better than staying at home all day. It is for this reason that I am incredibly bored over the summer break.
Where the HELL have you been?!
Ninjazz: I can be patient if you want? ;)
Ninjazz: Sleeping?
haha i now have in my hand TheRandomKid 's secret recipe
Om: Right. ._.
im baack
Xer[a]: I have to much fun outside of school. :D
He has no idea what teh recipe is
Om: Don't you dare ruin this for me. :|
GilDash: I don't know what is going on.
yes im aware of that
Om: THen keep *silent*.
...
GilDash be quiet and watch how everything you built up will fall
...
Last hope.
Gone.
...
Ninjazz: You're hoping against what you really want. Of course it's going to go. ;)
boo
/me sets head on desk
/me grabs GilDash and puts her to the idle corner
/me places her hoof on Ninjazz's shoulder.
Ninjazz: I don't need an answer right away. :)
Good.
My head can't think of any.
hehhhhhhh..........im bored
good for you
Ninjazz: You've got all the time in the world. :)
I'm litterally just drawing a blank here.
These moments of silence are real.
I really am derping out here.
...
Ninjazz: You only need a couple of words... ;)
GilDash Id suggest you stay the buck away from ninjazz. wait... he doesnt know my recipe... YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO HIM!
wait is he writing a fic?
TheRandomkid321: Can you please stop clamoring. :|
thank you GilDash
^
The recipe is mine. All mine. None of you will get it
we don't want it
so why do you keep bringing it up
/me throws it inot a volcano
Invi: I've patience aplenty, but he was beginning to wind even me up.
GilDash i was so close to do so too...
GilDash is ninjazz writing a fic or something
Invi: We still need to work out payment for that chloroform. :D
:P I know
I probably should ofd mermorized taht BEFORE throwing it into that volcano. AW well.
pony_911: No. Ninjazz is stuggling in real life right now. :)
/me returns to playing with rubiks cube
why?
Cause I'm a strange pony that's why.
pony_911: You should've been here to watch since the start. :D
Ninjazz no you are not strange
I know this may sound weird, but my battery charger for my laptop sounds like a sleeping persong.
Guys guys

Ninjazz: There's nothing strange about it. You should've seen some of ther other reactions I've had. :)

/me briefly pays attention to the chat. wonders what GilDash is trying to tempt Ninjazz with and drops his monacle
Ninjazz: However you want. Instead of torturing yourself just pick something. ;)
/me is confused
FlareChaser: How small is she exactly? :D

Adrian Brodystate
GilDash: Ahahhaa i guess you're right "Goddess" xD
/me yawns
Airpuff: I thought it was "godslayer". ;)
/me spills a whole bucket of energydrink over CrazyCherry
GilDash: bouth xD

Thankyou Invi.....

I was being sarcastic...

Invi, energy drinks are less effective if they taken by osmosis
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2734/
Om: Want to come out and play? :)
Mutterguy hm, you are right. Do you have a cone?

Mutterguy: Go slep. Right now. :|
Let's see what i can do then xD
/me hugs GilDash
Needs to be about 20% streamier.
Allo everypony.
Hey Meanwhile.
WHY WON'T MY COMPANY ANSWER ME?! :[
hey Meanwhile
Kinda in a weird zone, atm. Beware.
/me hides
A weird zone?
yeah I think the cat has gotten up tell me to go to bed too
GilDash: Having problems? :S
Is that like the Twilight zone but more aptly named?
Ehhh.
No.
Hard to explain.
Seriously, you sign up for a contract but you can't contact them to get your blood starting hours? What gives?! :[
GilDash: Lazer interfirence
Om: I will hurt you *sooo* hard.
In other news, I went to the dentist earlier.
GilDash: Uh huh.
/me smacks Om.
Which flavor of lollypop did you get, Meanwhile?
Pain flavour.
Owch.
testing
GilDash: GILDY CALM THE FACK DOWN!!!
oh i hate it when my internet dies
Meanwhile: Was it red by any chance?
The filling I had done was apparently "only a little one" so I declined anesthetic,.
And it was a little one.
Until she took a fucking drill to it.
CrazyCherry: I WILL WHEN I GET AN ANSWER! THEY'VE HAD A MONTH TO GET ME MY HOURS! :[
Owch...
How should i Pose her then guys? o.o
/me pat GilDash on the back
Drill, then sander, then sander again. Then filling.
:S dat pain
Still hoping.
And then she sanded the filling.
Meanwhile: Never say no to anesthetic.
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3075/
/me hugs Ninjazz.
Meanwhile, declining anesthetics at the dentist is usually not a smart move in my experience.
GilDash: i once had my adenoids ripped out without anestesia
Anypony? T.T
hio twilight_sprinkler
And then she cleaned my teeth with some kind of weird little drill thing.
hoi Invi
twilight_sprinkler: See previous answer.
or hoi Invi1
Which basically meant she stabbed me in the gumline right next to every single tooth.
GilDash: Calm down. Just calm down.
lol my internet derped ^^
again...
CrazyCherry: It's not fair. :(
GilDash: at least now i can brag about it:P the worst part came after the operation, when i began puking because doctor gave me too much of other stuff
Yeah, if I ever decline anesthetic at the dentist again someone kick me in the leg.
/me sighs
Will do.
GilDash: I know. Life isn't fair. Just phone 'em again untill they respond.
twilight_sprinkler: Doctors, eh? :D
GilDash: ikr:P
Meanwhile my brother made good experience with it
/me will offer anaesthetic for the kick
Airpuff: However you want.
CrazyCherry: It just keeps going to voicemail I've phoned them 5 times now, and I left a message yesterday. It's sort of important that a new employee needs to know when the hell to start! :D
Om so noooo requests or what so ever? ._.
Airpuff as i said: Lyra
Airpuff: Draw my OC. :)
What're you doing Airpuff?
GilDash: True... True.... :D
I mean... i can do "Cute" or "shy" or anything ._.
Airpuff: "Aggresive." ;)
Airpuff Lyra as cute as possible
GilDash: Well now im doing a lyra before that, give me a picture of your pony and ill see what i can do when im done with Lyra xD
Invi1: .. so cute.. then x)
Make her enraged,.
Airpuff: I don't actually have a concept for her. I'd like to see what someone else comes up with. :D
Meanwhile: but thats not really her style though, is it?
How do you know.
GilDash: ahaha Well i can sure try that once.
She's a background pony.
Airpuff would you recommend something else than cute? ^^
For all we know she's beating Bonbon off screen.
With ALOT of fanon.
Airpuff: Did you see her when Flim and Flam tried to see their crap? She looked like she was going mental. :D
*sell
Invi1: not really.. i was thinking maybe a bit like cute/shy mix
/me sneezes.
CrazyCherry: Bless you. :)
gesundheit CrazyCherry
What they said.
Let's phone them. AGAIN. :|
/me blesses CrazyCherry with holy smoke xD
GilDash...cutie mark = a pair of fluffy handcuffs
Still hoping.
Airpuff: Excuse me?
Anyways then, ping me if you want anything, im going to draw xD
Ninjazz hoping what?
CrazyCherry: one says "bless you" when somepony sneezes..
/me is going to play Borderlands , because it has "plot-missions"
Her day gets better.
CrazyCherry: so i blessed you xD
Plot-missions.
THEY JUST PUT THE BLOODY PHONE DOWN ON ME! :[
Anyways, ping me if its something you wanna say xDD
Man GilDash your company is trolling you hard.
have fun Airpuff ^^
Invi1: Thanks ^^
GilDash: AWW SHJIT!!
Wait a sec...
Meanwhile: I haven't even started yet! I'm just trying to get my bloody dates sorted out.
The mods are asleep POST HUMANS!!
I believe "pissed" no longer covers this.
5 bits says when someone finally does answer you they don't know your hours.
Ninjazz: I could defenestrate something so *hard* right now.
Mods are asleep. http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/754/AnBWa.jpg
Ninjazz so she is really angry now? on you?
I don't even know what defenestrate means...
/me moves away from GilDash
Meanwhile: If that's the case I'm just turning up at 8 and saying fuck you. I've been kind enough to wait a month, I'm not going to put up with stupidity on their part.
Invi1: No. Not on me. Just a bunch of ass holes.
/me hands GilDash a CRT tv. he's seen a couple on the freeway embankment
Mutterguy: ... Thank you. :)
/me defenestrates CRT TV.
Ninjazz why? what did they do?
Invi: Basically professionally trolling her. But if you want the full story scroll up.
Wait...
Your internet derps, right?
I hate allergies....
yup
I'm allergic to alergies.
And Whoopi Goldberg.
/me decides to defenstrate a box of tennis balls for the hell of it
I'm allergic to you!!!
Wait what?
morning, all.
/me hugs CrazyCherry.
Meanwhile: Why Whoopi Goldberg? :S
WallDives: Holla! :)
AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH
It was the first name that came to mind GilDash.
/me swells up
Allo WallDives.
moin WallDives
Meanwhile: Oh, okay. Who doesn't like WHoopi Goldberg?
I dont.
The KKK?
who?
WallDives: Why not?
Meanwhile: Valid point. :D
Because Theodore Rex, thats why.
WallDives: ... Okay...
its a really shitty movie that sunk Whoopi Goldberg's career.
/me is playing Minecraft.
WallDives: Oh, that makes more sense.
/me vaguely remebers a simpsons joke involving porn of Whoopi goldberg... this was about 13 years ago
No wonder I havent seen it
You should have bought a squirrel.
or it might have just been nude pictures
I like whoopi!
Mutterguy: either wouldnt be too attractive...
whoop whoop
Hey WallDives.
Right, I'm going to email them. If I don't get an answer by Friday heads will roll. :)
oh? whats going on?
GilDash: :|
So much for hoping.
Eh. Still hoping.
Heads gonna roll like Bloodlord Mandokir levelled up.
Not my head I hope.
I like it where its at don't you?
Om.
You really asking that?
Yes?
You better quite while you're ahead. Kill me now, I deserve it. Put me out of my misery.
95 people in chat, about 10 that actually say anything.
11
Meanwhile: ...thats normal.
Ninjazz: I thought it was a good pun.
I know, but why?
I did say weird zone, didn't I?
Om, you're too kind.
Who opens the web page or the chat client just to sit there.
Meanwhile: 90-9-1 theory, would be my guess.
Good morning everypony.
morning, pyrocatboy.
Ninjazz: Not kind, I just love puns far to much.
WallDives: Care to tell me what that is?
Allo pyrocatboy
Hiya pyrocatboy!!!
right I should apply myself to bed
Hi pyrocatboy.
Hey Om, still want to see that drawing? I've finally managed to upload it correctly.
Mutterguy: Are you an accecory?
I see, Om. That explains alot.
Malavolent: Sure.
http://fav.me/d50wrkq
Meanwhile: 90% of users do nothing or have minimal impact (lurkers, stream watchers, etc.), 9% actually do something (regulars), 1% greatly contribute (ops, admins, streamers, etc.)
Om a wat?
Godammit parents! Just as i was getting started i have to drive for them -.-

Bronysith: Good fun.
WallDives: all seriousness, gratz.
WallDives: I'm not sure when my starting hours are for my new job and I don't want to take the blame because I can't get in contact with them to find out.
Bronysith: Congratulations. :)
Bronysith: Well done, now go and be someone's slave :)
Malavolent: i am molestias slave
I've got one more week to go. :(
GilDash: gratz on your new job, but you should really be harassing them about new hours.
gratz GilDash whats ur job?
and I have to restart classes in september...
Bronysith: If she pays you well, I see nothing wrong with that ;)
WallDives: I've phoned them up five times for the past two days. :D
Malavolent: once you get used to her horn its not that bad
Bronysith: I believe so.
WallDives: I've emailed them now too, so I'm just going to keep up until I get an answer.
WallDives: I went there for an interview, yeah. THey said they were in the process of sorting out the hours. They've got back to me with the start date but not the hours.
GilDash: ah...then I guess you just wait until the start date then.
And then go on a rampage.

Om. Invi, sounds like scary dudes.
/me sips tea
Cause I love tea.
Ninjazz they have many shapes, but only if you make them angry, they attack
Ninjazz: it was drugged
Also love coffee.
Bronysith: I made it. It's not. >:3
/me tosses his computer out of the window.
Ninjazz: coffee was also drugged
I love fruit juices.
i love horses
CrazyCherry: That is called defenstrating.
Ninjazz: Mods are what we need when we all get told what we're posting is illegal and has been sent to the police. :D
Coffee is a drug.
/me noms on horse
Om: Ok....
GilDash: Heh.:D
Ninjazz: no caffeine is
Bronysith: Same difference.
Ninjazz: and it just happens to contain caffeine
GilDash xD
Nope.
School.
Ninjazz: so chocolate is also a drug
damnit

Bronysith: I need my fix pretty soon of it.

http://derpy.me/CQEMG
tldr
Did you know your body does not absorb caffine, it goes through your system and into sewage. But is not prccesed by the water treatment plants. So it goes into rivers and streams, thus some fish are found with caffine in them.
Ninjazz that's one of my desktop backgrounds ^^
ikr
I don't know I had that up... But meh post anyway, I thought.
Om: That's nice. :)
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4550/ GilDash
GilDash: LEARNING!
http://derpy.me/lPSe6
Om: Fun facts aren't fun.
Om not sure if good or bad ^^
Bronysith: Drinking from it, you simpleton.
Huh. Never joined the afternoon stream before...how is everyone?
hiya OneOverZero http://derpy.me/lPSe6
OneOverZero: alright.
Ninjazz he didn't said it's a funfact
Hey OneOverZero. You should probably run.
Invi: It sounded fun. :(
OneOverZero: You'r guna die :(
Ninjazz lol
Hiya OneOverZero!!!

Oh good, and here I thought the death threats were normal.
normal for me so far.
In freakin' deed.
Reikim: :D
Invi: Today is a normal day. Without the mods overbearing. :D
Reikim: They are.
GilDash that's the same :D
Damnit, I need to go put my chocolate in the fridge. :D
Overbearing mods?! What is this blasphemy you speak of?
LAZORS!
GilDash: That hot, huh?
and i need to get chocolate....
It's too warm.
I hate the weather
uh-oh, we got lazors in the chat now.
24,8°C here
/me dodges the lazors
I find it nice :)
My AC makes it a nice 77 F.
Ninjazz: I'm too poor to know what temp it is in the house.
Currently 21°C here.
hai everypony
moin Michael
Om: Usually around 80 during the night and high 90s during the day.
Why are we suddenly comparing room temperatures?
Hiya Micheal!!!
hi
Ninjazz what is that in °C ?
hi DrHobo.
Om: Wait... I derped out again. Srry.
Hiya DrHobo!!!
Ninjazz: Well, I live in the evergreen state.
hai DrHobo
Invi: Not sure, I hate math. :S
Hey DrHobo!
Oh well, much as I'd like to stay around, I really just dropped in to say hi...if anyone is still around when the evening crew comes on, say hi for me.
Om: Thats... which one again? Washington?
Ninjazz what does math have to do with that? ^^
Invi: 90F is 32C.
^
ah
Leme see if I can find that Celcius to Ferhenhiet converter program I made once...
now i need another reference value
I went to google something and got distracted by the little piano thing.
Invi: Conversion factors.
It's 23 C
um, wth is going on? XD
in here
Now I can't remember what I was googling. t^t
Ninjazz: Yes washington
Ponies.
Om: Awwwww Yeeeeaaaah! Still remember something! :D
its currently 21C/70F here, its actually kinda nice, for once.
Ninjazz so it is the same scale but shifted?
no
Invi: Something like that.
wait
Ninjazz: You get +3 internets
Duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck.....
CrazyCherry: Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucl
Om: I've neve had an internet before. What do they eat?
Your life.
Good one.
Tea is almost gone. :c
And now I need tea. Brb
:C
Ninjazz: Meanwhile Is right.
O______________________________________O
Usually is.
/me yawns
Something the matter, CrazyCherry?
/me sneezes.
Ninjazz: Sneezing.
Oh. :D
CrazyCherry: Are you not entertained? :D
GilDash: Maybe........
I have a keyboard on my laptop, how fancy am i?
lol
Om: I have it too.
And tea has been sacrificed to make me feel better.
It's an odd feeling.
CrazyCherry: But are you using two computers at the same time?
Ninjazz: :P
6_9
Om: Nope.
Om: I must be fancy too then. :)
GilDash: You're british. Thats atumatic semi fancy
Om: I'm Yorkshish. That's an automatic inverse. :D
GilDash: How so?
Is that like rednecks for English?
lol
Om: We're like anti-posh to make up for the poshness of the rest of England. :D
Fancy rednecks.
Om: Not really, just stuck in the coal mines. :D
GilDash: Sounds...Eh-fun?
WallDives: You watched too many movies and stuff.
I'm Finnish. I'm naturally semi-naturefriendly.
Wait what.....
chat is quiet.
yep.
I just killed my tea. I'm sad. :c
Why is chat quiet?
Back. With tea.
With a hard southern accent, there sin't a difference in pronounceing Bag. And Big
*BOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
now it was loud
WallDives: Yeah, Yorkshire is one of the few places not too badly represented in Movies. :D
GilDash: I don't watch movies tho!
GilDash: I thought Yorkshire is equivilant to like West Virginia and stuff.
Ninjazz how can you kill tea?
/me eats a donut
Well, today is probably the day that kills me.
Ninjazz: How do you kill tea? Without Airpuff here to tell me putting half a bucket of sugar in, of course. :D
You drink it.
Ninjazz no, that day will come, but not today
Naw.
WallDives: I don't know West Virginia, so I couldn't comment. :D
besides, I dont watch too many movies.
You guys saw me depressed on Monday.
Ninjazz but then it lives inside of you and becomes a part of you
Because I failed Spanish.
Ninjazz: You know English, you'll be fine. :)
Here i come with the bad time mind.... I has to go....
GilDash: Might have failed that one as well. :S
CrazyCherry: You have no idea how much I want to defenestrate you right now. :D
Ninjazz: Disregard failure, enjoy oneself. :)
GilDash: That sounded. Odd.
GilDash: My philosophy.
GilDash: I do.... I want to do the same.
Nyeeh, my gums are still sore from the dentist and I just got mouth burn from my tea ;n;
Owch, Meanwhile.
Om: Quiet you. ;)
GilDash: coal mines and backwater places.
GilDash: I don't know how!
WallDives: Yeah, with an influx of immigrants to the point where the previous immigrants are moving out for new ones. :D
So anyways, if you guys see me again today, expect the |Depressed tag again.
Meanwhile: Have you ever had a tooth growing out of the roof of your mouth?
BYE BYE EVERYPONY!!

CrazyCherry: See ya! :)

Well, this is fun. :D
GilDash: what, not taking numbers as usual?
WallDives: I need people to bounce off of. ;)
WallDives: If you're offering...
WallDives: Take this Lazer and run!
...not now, I have too many other things to do today.
/me gives WallDives lazer
WallDives: I'll keep a note of that. ;)
Happens to me everytime...
besides, I'm not content being a number. I are too greedy.
WallDives: You'd better try and make an impression then. ;)
noted.
WallDives: Don't, its not worth it.
Om: Shh, you. You don't know yet. ;)
wow I'm almost done with season 1 already in my daily MLP
GilDash: Perhaps not, but I found matches
Om: Let me make that decision.
song for waiting: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEDgd5h-GwY
/me confiscates matches from Om.
WallDives: I cant let you do that Star-er WallDives

GilDash: I was guna lite an insents with those :(
Om: Of course you were...
WallDives: Lylat Wars?
CrimsonPhoenix: orly? :D
Michael: i can live with this...
I was about to counter with the Jeopardy theme but this

GilDash: I was! It was a fles-Ehh. Purple, one.
theme is just epic
Om: Fles... what now?
GilDash: Flese.
quiet chat
Om: Lylat Wars is Starfox64 over in Europe, iirc.
Not in mood. Shush.
Om: I have no idea what you're on about. :D
WallDives: Ohhh.
GilDash: Good. Now gime those back
WallDives: I think you do. I vaguely recall playing something with that name.
still have full medals in normal, all but 2 medals in expert.
Om: Only when you explain to me fully what you intend to use them for in a way I can understand. :)
GilDash: I KNOW its Lylat Wars in the UK, I dont know if it is in the rest of the region.
step﻿ 1: download this song, step 2: put it on MP3 player on repeat, step 3: go fishing, step 4 (optional):obtain hat.
/me got his orange pekoe tea :)
GilDash: I want to make nice smelling smoke
: obtain hat
that comment
best comment
Om: Why? This isn't a church.
xD
GilDash: I like eeeeet. Now gimie.
Om: What if somepony here suffers from asthma. That would be impolite.
I can breath just fine.
GilDash: They'll grow out of it.
Ninjazz: You're breathing gets mighty rapid around me. ;)
Ehh.
Ninjazz: Ha!
Om: I don't trust you with fire.
/me tackles Om
GilDash: B-but...Fire! And nice smo-(is takcled)
Not another fight... :|
I just tackled him.
yay, fights!
fight? where? who?
It's not a fight
HE WANTS MY BODY!
/me stops fight
Om: He's not the only one. ;)
/me raises eyebrow
/me runs away from chat to make oatmeal
/me sits in a corner
i demand a nice, calm and peacefull fight until death :)
Ninjazz: Well, looks like we're alone again. :)
Again...
Ninjazz: Hey, how's your studying going? :)
Terribly. I hate numbers.
/me boops Ninjazz in the face hard before leaving again
Ow...
Deserved that, I guess.
Ninjazz: Keep going at it, alright. I'm going to chase Om for now...
/me grabs Om and gives him ni Ninjazz
*to
Ni!
:[ no fights!
/me teleports on top of Om.
GilDash: you're going to chase the poor guy until the end of time, arent you?
NI Om NI
That means never, not no
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lav-VxMX59w
WallDives: There's only two options, and I'm not waiting long enough for one of them. :)
/me sighs
hey are we still on zelda?
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1337787467161.jpg
cause this is relevent
Nope.
/me senses a disturbance
starfox -> LoZ
CrimsonPhoenix sorry, too late
CrimsonPhoenix: lol the pic
Om: How do you like your new hat?
GilDash: You aren't wearing one?
meh Starfox is good
/me pokes Om's hat
but the series went beyond shit after 64
Have you guys checked out the Dr. Whooves, how do i describe them ... youtube audiobooks, thats all i can think off
also, the vid link I posted above made me so jealous.
Applechip i heard some, yes
CrimsonPhoenix: I think I might be one of the few that actually liked Assault.
It's kinda like Starfox Battlefield.
Om: Fedora, actually, but how do you like your new one?
I'll have to be honest though Assault was decent
/me places hooves on Om's head.
I liek fedoras...
but nowhere near as good as 64
/me doesn't know anything about Starfox.
e_e
since it was story based and not arcade based
Meanwhile ditto
Meanwhile: Starwing and Lylat Wars where you are.
Aye.
All I know is "DO A BARREL ROLL"!
Its old and not very stylish
I don't know anything about either of those either WallDives
Ninjazz all your base are belong to us
meh. too bad then.
INvi that's....Zero Wing
I actually played the game
Invi: Move zig move zig move zig move every zig.
god damn it's hard
WHAT YOU SAY?
but seriously, almost 700 hits in Area6? WTF?
I think I'll rest my back for a while.
That is what I think of my hat. Old and not stylish.
Ninjazz: Have fun in bed. ;)
lol
I was jumping around like a kid after getting 550.
Almost didn't even need to come back to the computer to know who pinged me.
Zero Wing was...I dont know.
Ninjazz: :D
by shump standards, its easy.
Ninjazz: DREAM OF TRIXIES!
nighty Ninjazz
Seeya Ninjazz
night Ninjazz.
bye Ninjazz
I'm just resting my damn back, guys.
Om: That's just cruel. :D
I still got lots of work to do.
oh lol oky ^^
GilDash: I am a cruel person
And Om. Die. :|
Ninjazz: I'd mute your computer if I were you. ;)
Ninjazz: Make me xD
/me tackles Om.
Don't need to. :P
/me tackles Om too
Not yoooooou!
Om pile on!
Time is killing everyone. Really slowly.
not fast enough for some, though.
Sad but true.
kill time before it kills you
still no stream?
/me kills time
yup
teh_Tharassan: nope.
:(
Michael fail ^^
this chat is so undead
/me stop rime
/me crawls out of pile "You cant kill me! I'm INVINCIBLE!"
time*
Is the chat actually quiet enough that I feel compelled to start writing? :D
Om: you're a loony.
/me grabs Om and pulls him back
/me Cue liquid nitrogen freezing Om.
GilDash: almost. I can see you grabbing citrus.
let's play fluttershy's game, keep silent!
I lose.
Me to.
:s
/me is frozen
/me hits frozen Om with a huge Sledgehammer
ugh. so much fun here, I dont want ot deal with people...
lol
Alright, enough of tha... What is going on here?
WallDives: Ironically, I don't write with citrus fruits unless someone else is involved. :D
magic happened
nothing <_< >_>
:I
magic is my answer to everything
I almost feel baited into responding to that, GilDash. Almost.
Why would you write using citris? Isn't that a liquid? Does it make good ink?
That's how it usually happens, WallDives. Trust me.
I know. curse me being too smart to not fall for it.
Let's see how that scan is going.
serious note though, sending my form to declare my major today.
Just some warnings.
WallDives: Play dumb. You'll have more fun. ;)
WallDives: That is a like don't listen to GilDash
Lie* :S
Meh.
Think I'm gonna go set up some things at the place.
See you folks later.
later Meanwhile.
c ya Meanwhile
Cya Meanwhile.
Meanwhile: ba bahy
give Trixie my regards.
Take care.
I really love my screen saver
bye Meanwhile

Not too sure If I like quiet chats. :S
Time for some Tool I think...
?
Another thing that I don't get here, probably.
WallDives: A band. Listening to 10,000 days currently.
ah.
Ninjazz: Would you prefer me to cause a clamor.
Yse, actually.
Who here knows Gantz?
Invi: read some of it.
/me raises hoof
/me licks Om's ear sensually.
brb.
WallDives i watched the whole anime
Ninjazz: How was Trixie last night? She treat yo-(twitches)

You deserve every bit of what you get, you bastard. :|

Hi cachi01.
Dark92Enigma Gantz ^^
hai cachi01
looks like I might be going to New York in August.
Hello everyone
gonna be here for half an hour
hi Cobellanez
Hi Cobellanez.
moin Cobellanez
hai Dark92Enigma
Ninjazz: Stop using the Trixie emote and that might be belaveable
hai Cobellanez
is there a stream?
Cobellanez: Holla! :)
nope cachi01
cachi01 nope
/me rests on Om's back and sucks on his ear.
Om: I don't like Fluttershy too much either. :[
ok thx
uhmmmm
Ninjazz: DEAMON!
Hello cachi01, Ninjazz, Invi, Michael, and GilDash.
D:
I'd better get my chocolate from the freezer whilst I still remember. :D
Gantz? Oh you mean.....the Gantz project right? I've heard of it....
also, hi Cobellanez /late
/me rests on GilDash
Om: Oooooh. Do I sense a sore nerve?
Ninjazz: Y U NO LOVE FLUTTERSHY
Hello WallDives
^
GilDash: Why must you do that to my foor ears!
Hanako is best Fluttershy.
Dark92Enigma that anime with that dark ball
Because Fluttershy is boring, cachi01.
Ninjazz: :O
Invi so i heard
...
:(: yaaaaaaaaaay
lolo
Ninjazz: You, you are not a real person!
lol
Dark92Enigma i tell you, it is a amazing psychothriller
Great... I've angered a heard of moe moe fanboys. -_-
Ninjazz: this is why you dont have a favorite. you never piss off anyone.
You all love Fluttershy when such a great pony like Rarity deserves love.
Dark92Enigma too bad that there is no season 2 as far as i know
WallDives: That's no fun.
also, Street Fighter 25th Anniversary tournament!
Invi might check it out......it should be better than.....(sighs) Shadow Star
Ninjazz: i like rarity
cachi01: And yet.
Ninjazz: I love Fluttershy because she reminds me of my sister who I love and barely get to see >.>
WallDives is there a tournament?
someday, me being overcompetitive will get me killed.
rarity pshh..
Om: You never told me that part.
Dark92Enigma it might be pretty confusing some times, but it is awesome ^^
Dark92Enigma: http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2012/may/23/capcom-announces-limited-edition-street-fighter-25th-anniversary-collection-set-tournament-dates/
Dark92Enigma but the ending could have been better though
WALL, sorry.
has sumica streamed elfen lied or school days?
Nope.
Ninjazz: Now you know.
Too much.
Om: So should I not talk crap about Fluttreshy?
Ninjazz: Dont hate on ponies. Is all I ask.
WallDives: :O must get
Om: Only those who call for it.
TRIXIE. Is a good example.
is there a flame war going on?
someday, me being overcompetitive will get me killed.
Brazil? I live in Chile, WallDives, but i'm in college......
Ninjazz: Trixie is halarious.
^
Trixie doesn'
t deserve
our hate
why are
Om: Trixie is a arrogant, self centered show off.
WHO LOVE MANDOPONY?
we speaking
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad9PyRdYDMI&feature=g-u-u Daring Do theme
like this
Ninjazz she just wants attention, and hating = attention
Ninjazz: yes she is.
WallDives......''I hate losing''-Akuma
And hundreds love her for it.
Ninjazz: Love and tolerate mang.
that's how people work
Let me be one of the people who don't love her for it.
Om: That only applies to trolls.
there is always somebody out there that loves it, no matter what it is
Ninjazz: *Why* is she a narcissitic attention admirer?
I...I have to win...
Who we talking about?
Twilight Sparkle Bryan WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!
hello hello hello
CrimsonPhoenix: You O_O
moin Dken2021
Doohohoho
WallDives: What do you mean you have to win?
/me pokes CrimsonPhoenix with a stick against the head
unless I'm in HRT I'm in no way a girl
/me noms on Om's ears.
hey guys
What's up Invi
hai alexxm
alexxm: Holla! :)
hai Dken2021
hi alexxm!! :)
GilDash: tournament. Actually, anything really, I HATE losing.
hai alexxm
GilI think it means he doesn...-______- want to lose
GilDash: Why? The way she carries herself. She gets into competitions AJ, RD, or Rarity don't touch her, but when she does something she physically harms them. Then she lies about something and two idiots nearly destroy a town because of it.
Bleh.
This chocolate is so deliciously cold. :)
I hate talking about it anyway.
All fanon.
Ninjazz: I don't mean why is she seen that way, I mean why is she like that in the first place?
all of it.
duuuuuuuuuuuude i totally miss you
ARE WE TALKING SERIOUS ABOUT A SHOW?
GilDash: Show pony.
i really fucking miss youuuuu
ooh, GilDash being intellectual. I like.
My ears will be comiting Van Goh if you keep trying to ingest them GilDash >.>
cachi01: what?
Ninjazz: And you're right. It's all fanon Somepony who has a problem like that needs some kind of background, and most people will have some kind of sypathetic one for her.
WallDives: i got addicted to tenacious D
CrimsonPhoenix nah, you should have read the other comics before first ....
ah. Get any better in Skullgirls?
WallDives: I can be intellectual when I want. I just prefer not to. Too much fun. :)
I noticed.
GilDash ikr? ^^
oh
Om: Unless you really want to cut your ears off, I'm going to keep doing this. And you merely saying so isn't enough to change my mind. ;)
WallDives: npe lol minecraft has my life now lol
/me noms Om's ears.
boo~.
GilDash why actually the ears?
GilDash: It pisses me off. She gets so much love for being such a HATEABLE character, and then we have other ponies who DONT deserve hate, yet here comes the hate train! CHOO CHOO! I feel so down... :(
i like trains
Invi: Don't encourage it further.
Ninjazz: I like Gilda. Look at what I've got to put up with. :D
Ninjazz stupid people are stupid
indeed
Invi: I... like ears... :$
GilDash i see.... ^^
GilDash: She yelled at Fluttershy... >_> You know how fans can get.
Invi: And Om's taste strongly of coffee... :)
they do?
/me nomz on Om's ear
Invi: No, its just an excuse
Defaq!?
i've done the first draft of the article
brb
and guys whats with the RD x fluttershy kiss at the wedding???? i didnt saw it at what frame or in what moment did it happened?
Not a kiss.
somewhere when the changelings attacked
I checked frame by frame. No kiss.
Om can i get a piece of that?
Just some weird noise.
e______e You ponies, are terible
but it might as well be since everyone's so riled up about it
Ninjazz: Yeah, they overlook everything else about her and point straight to that. She's a bitch, first and foremost, but what fascinates me is she will do anything to try and keep RD close. To me it looks like more than her just wanting control. She can't despose of her; that's proven when she splutters at RD before bailing.
No kiss
Om or you are just terrible and we are normal <_<
Invi: So, do Om's ears taste like coffee? :)
GilDash: Aye. So true. So true.
/me sighs
I fucking hate numbers.
don't you just love how people take things too far?
GilDash yesh, I liek :3
Invi: Ah!-...maybe...
OH ABSOLUTELY.
(sarcasm)
Ninjazz: I like to look at the entire character. Yes, Trixie is a show off obsessed loud mouth. But in the time of need she also tried to put up a fight against the Ursa Minor, even if she knew it was a losing battle. Why? Why not bail?
because she overestimated the usra?
GilDash: Thing is, I know that part. I understand that part. But, I can't over the fact that her fanon rather irritates the living piss out of me.
or underestimated
Ninjazz: Welcome to life, where we all live in denial. :)
/me sets head on desk
GilDash Show Off? That sounds like something Dolph Ziggler would say
/me sets desk on head
Dark92Enigma: It's not a uncommon phrase. :S
this song...
:D
/me on set head desck
/me whops Dark92Enigma.
/me strokes Ninjazz's mane slowly.
who is dolph ziggler?
no. no wrestling refrences.
GilDash i know i was being sarcastic
Invi: Wrestling.
Ninjazz: It'll be alright on the night. :)
Invi: WWE
I hope so.
hm, my grampa watches that
/me gets whooped
Dark92Enigma: Doesn't help that the internet doesn't translate sark and I've no idea who Dolph Ziggler is. :D
Stone Cold is best wrestler
GilDash it appears to me, that it seems to be a wrestler
couldnt remember the best song in the wooooorld no this is just a tribute..
Invi: A what now? :D
CrimsonPhoenix: stone cold is a joke, nWo.
Cold Stone has good icecream
GilDash a wrestling fighter?
Nah Stone Cold is best wrestler
Om: Maybe we should go get some ice cream?
and that's the bottom line
cause Stone Cold said so
Invi: I was being intentionally dumb. :D I know what it is I just don't care for it.
''Unlike you, i can prove it, by stealing the show every single night.......#HEEL''
GilDash: Don't you already have some?
Aye. Om.
GilDash oh lol
/me licka Ninjazz
/me spills ice cream on Om.
/me licks alexxm
Om: Whoops. :$
Undertaker is the best wrestler
/me wipes off drool
-_-
Hi Claude. -_-
Undertaker is ancient.
The Rock is best wrestler
hey Claude hows your day been
/me licks the ice cream off of Om.
but undertaker is cool
I know enough GilDash, to know where that was going
good thanks alexxm you?
Ice? Ish want Ice cream too :P
Om: You mean you saw through my carefully plotted plan of attack? :D
good Claude finished the first draft of the article today
WallDives.....yes, but he brought me into wrestling
THE article? what article?
alexxm did my video helped?
is a mod here?
GilDash: You have done this before. With other sugary things.
yeah it did Invi
kirzstryfe.
Lil_B i guess kirz is on
the brony article Claide
/me licks at Om's neck.
Om: Have I?
ahah
/me shivers
/me licks Om too :3
Om: I'm just trying to get you clean. :D
Well, now.
me too
kirzstrife are you there?
Likes like Om has some work to do.
GilDash: You're both doing it wrong.
Have fun.
GilDash Om is so dirty with all this ice cream
/me licks GilDash
well WallDives i hope daniel bryan gets a rematch
/me licks Om eagerly.
WallDives who do you think is the best right now? I'm between Y2J and CM Punk
Invi: I know! I might need some help. ;)
but mostly Y2J
i like both Dark92Enigma but i hope daniel bryan gets a rematch
Does anyone know an obscure god I can pray to?
gozer Om
/me covers Om in chocolate gravy
In Wrestling in General, I like Bobby Roode.
Om: Airpuff is a god apparently. :D
Invi: You >.>
Om I <.<
if Airpuff is a god, I must be a athiest, cause I dont believe it.
Invi, Om: Mmmm...
IM BACK EVERYPONY!!!!
WallDives: Neither do I. I let him live his dream though. ;)
/me licks Invi

good Bronysith finished the first draft of it
GilDash: No thanks to you, oh wait. This WAS your doing!
alexxm: kelio
WallDives: Not always. There's a reason I'm "Godslayer." ;)
Om: I didn't pour the.. chocolate... on you...
I'm going to leave that one alone.
Invi: Why are you engouraging it?
WallDives there is no doubt that Punk is superior in wrestling terms (Hell, i'm a straight edge myself) BUT IN Showmanships terms Y2J is the second best next to the Rock
hai Bronysith
GilDash: But you sure are more than ready to lick it off eh?
Om because i find it funny ^^
http://derpy.me/lPSe6
Invi: Har har.
Om: It's going to take some time...
WallDives i heard he's about to leave again........He needs a title rematch
/me licks Om too
Dark92Enigma: he wont.
Om and tatsty
*tasty
nom
/me sucks on Om's neck.
Om: Coffee chocolate...
WallDives i kind of want bryan danielson to get a rematch

Internet is fine, computer is shit.

Invi: oh... i bet mine is worse ^^

WallDives it's the other way around here :(
Maybe if I don't say anything it will go away <_<
Om: you know better.
Om: Nope. :)
/me stretches, making cracking sounds
Lil_B that is about opinion, we are bronies; love and TOLERANCE so you don't piss people off with that ^^
more tolerance, less love.
Invi: half a meg a sec
WallDives: I'm being hopeful.
Lovin' and tolerance. :)
oh god i rly forgot everything about German. i was able to speak som time ago.. derp
LOVE AND TOLERANCE!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
i know a word i german
panda 1 week earlier i had won (200kb/s) but now i have incredible 1000kb/s
Onyxia: I know that feel.
NEIN!
tove and loterare?
no tolerance, all you need is love
cachi01 and what does it mean?
Lil_B: i thik it means great ice cream dude
No
BarneyAndPonies: only love leads to jealousy, which leads to fights. which leads to me beating ass.
WallDives: at least i can speak english.. and i wont forget hao
cachi01 well you would be correct Sir
lol
Lil_B: lol
anyone here like dubstep?
No.
Onyxia: used to speak japanese (and not that well, admittingly).
i think tolerance has the same importance as love
Carpathia I recently got into it
/me licks the rest of the chocolate off of Om.
u cant love without tolerance
I like dubstep
I used to listen to it, but just haven't been into it lately
cause i put pony dubstep over the sonic rainboom scene
Om: You're all slobbery now. :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTHtNK46sl8
WallDives: always wanted to learn japanese
i very dislike dubstep ^^
^
GilDash: Oh really? And whos fault is that?
Om: Invi's. :)
U CANT KILL THE METAL
Onyxia: honestly, you need a good reason, games and anime dont and wont cut it.
cachi01 \m/
\m/
cachi01: The metal will live on.
cachi01 i hear hear VERYTHING!... axept metal...
I don't even...
Lil_B: :O

Om: Tell me I'm wrong. :)
Ninjazz: \m/
metal is music of gods
F'yea Metal!
heck yeah
GilDash: You're wrong.

welll... neo classic metal without vocals i really like
WallDives: i see... well if you like the language everything is easier.. anyway :p
\m/
Om: Silly filly. :D
\m/^3^\m/
/me kisses Om with chocolate mouth.
Curses why is that such a hard thing to type out?
|m|

GilDash: Thats, gross.
/me spills more chocolate gravy over Om

panda: I'm hoping for a certain pony in particular.
Om: hehe cuz it tastes of cotton candy of course
Ja, it's kirz
cachi, but i have Chiptunes from every systhem. Gameboy, C64, NES, AtariST, ZX Spectrum XD I even try to make some of my own
Ninjazz: hehe ^^ which on?
Om: Saved by the Wrek. :D

panda: Rarity~
Lil_B: i have some chiptune from GBA

Wait, is this Wrek?
GilDash: pretty sure its kirz.

GilDash its kirzstryfe
maybe i should try to recreate his battle theme :/ would be a good chellenge for a Music making NOOB like me
Invi me too
Om: hehe repeat it ^^
That makes more sense. Wrek doesn't seem to do that kind of outlining. :)
panda: I said what.
Om: It that case you've been saved by the Kirz. :D
GilDash: true... so then... who is it?
BRB im getting a yakult

Difference between kirz's and Wrek's drawing streams: Wrek got a Twilight desktop pony on his stream
Om: remember, even the morningstar was a angel.
panda: The source of your infromation is what concerns me.
Radu: yeah i forgot
Radu: Kirz has also snapped the stream to just the SAI eindow.

Om you just ask for it

You can always tell a LivingTombstone song by the instruments used.
BarneyAndPonies it's kirz

Allo again everypony.

Meanwhile: IS BACK
hi Meanwhile!
Ip Man was awesome.
hey Meanwhile what have you been up to
Meanwhile: Holla! :)
Eating.
i see labryinth is on netflix
Ip Man was brilliant... saw it before it was shown here but still... awesome movie
hey there Meanwhile
/me getes more tea
Is there a lot of fighting in IP man?
Yes.
not everything is about fighting
lol
But it's not fighting so much as
thats why i love the OT of star wars. it doesnt focus purely on lightsabers
Magical_pablez94: its kirzstryfe whom is drawing
Watching a dude beat the stuffing out of everyone silly enough to try and mess with him.
Bronysith: whaaat??? seriously??? omg :D:D
:) random twilight
Meanwhile a dude or the dude?
pinkiepie678: my fav pony
the fighting in Ip Man is brutal though... you dont mess with a guy that knows Wing Chun...
why not both Invi
Invi: What's the diffference.
Meanwhile: u missed magic dance
Bronysith: The lightsabre fights were crap in terms of choriography, but still end up being the best fights due to characterisation and build up. :)
wat http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-fluttershy-will-always-get-her-way.png
You remind me of the babe.
Meanwhile the dude, don't you know the dude lebowski ^^
GilDash: the OT had the best lightsaber duels. you could feel emotion
Nah never seen that Invi
GilDash: luke was a novice and you could tell
Meanwhile then request it
Bronysith: Exactly. :)
Radu: xD
Who or what is he drawing now?
DiscordsMaker: a pony
Poni
GilDash: but it wasnt about the lightsaber. it was about the struggle behind it
Oh my.
I've already voted this week. And I'll forget by next week.
MY GOD!
the dude is simply the dude
kirzstryfe: i will pay you moneys to draw my oc
cachi01: Well which one?
/me notices a wild panda
DiscordsMaker: idk
the dude will molest everyone
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is awesome
Lighsaber ponies?
Om: thats my oc actually
Om: a unicorn pony levitating a lightsaber
Bronysith: Someone took analysis of all the lightsaber battles in the first episode. Literally, there could be no deflection and the saber wouldn't have made contact anyway. It's all flashy stuff and not a proper fight.
The name makes sense now Bronysith
You must new here be.
GilDash: exactly. all bullshit
Oooh Wreky hasn't finished Rarity :'(
How did you guys read that?
sorry...I forget to greet ya.... how's ya day been, GilDash ?
Bronysith: It's like demonstrative sparring as opposed to, say, a street fight.
Holy crap, this just in, lightsabres wouldn't work irl!
Om: lol. actually would u like to read my fanfic. i based my oc around him
Magical_pablez94: Not too bad. ;)
Go figure.
GilDash: yea. its bullshit
I hear the upbeat version of the Intermission theme?
GilDash: i liked the fight betweent eh dark knight and the other guy better
did u guys know that the lightsabes is now real????????? but it doesnt cut ur limbs or anything it just burns you
hey Sundaysmile hows your day been
Bronysith: Not now, I be buisy. Ocupied with an art of me own.

/me will think reading the saddest story of all time will be fun
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON?!
<--- Why the hay is Banjo even there? Kazooie seems to do all the work. :D
Luna_of_War: FINISHED WHAT?
OUR PMV HATH BEEN UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE!

WindWhistler: Because your computer has gained sentience.
And someone muted the computer
GilDash: Banjo is there to take the hits.

Luna_of_War: finished what?
Wait...are you playing the Xbox arcade version, whoever it is who's streaming?

I still want to see Pokemon movie 3 :3
*does happy troll dance* I ain't got no more high school no more
RainbowcrashNBurn: The extra honeycombs is EXTREMELY useful for that battle

/me laughs at windwhistler's clever joke.
Or did my chat just derp?
because pones
You'd hear crickets WindWhistler, but they were too uncomfortable at just how unfunny you are.
well i thought it was funny.
I suddenly feel tempted to play so many N64 games at this precise moment
:I
lol
i wonder why, rainbow
Good thing we still have our N64
paper mario for n64
how much life does the witch have
one of my fav games of all time
The only games I need to complete my nostalgia collection of the N64 are...
of ALL TIME!
...
:P
PinkiePieFTW: that is one of the games im tempted to play
you should
Chameleon Twist, Chameleon Twist 2, Gex 2, Gex 3, and Glover
I have it on wii cuz my n64 blew up
did the witch just say she needed to have a piss
Those are what I need
She saddle sore
alexxm: ... shes rhyming -.-
00,10so it's a humanised zecora?
WindWhistler: i have Gex 1 and 3, dont have 2 though
(i was dumb enough to plug it into a german outlet without a reall adapter)
what happened PinkiePieFTW
Sumica: Yeah, but she's forced to stop in Tooie because her sisters think it's annoying
it was just a little thing you put at the end of the plug to change the shape...
omg Sumica
Sumica yes, but she's actually an evil enchantress :3
and i plugged it in.
and there was a bang and a puff of smoke
needless to say my n64 didn't work afterwards.
PinkiePieFTW: :(

Meryl: $50
HAPPY ENDING
Aww snap!
I NEED PRICING SUGGESTIONS
:
DONE FOR
:D
Dat wasted spell
Meryl: 25 dollars

Meryl: I would suggest maybe double the cost it takes to make one
inb4 Banjo-Tooie
Tom!
seriously woman.. you were flying all over the bloody place -.-
Fall damage
00,10where did all the tocks ceom from/

I think $25 + Shipping is a good price.
HE BETTER PLAY BANJO-TOOIE
what are we playing, i just came in?
how can you tell WindWhistler
00,10*rocks come from*
Maybe the spell that missed, caused enough of a shockwave to cause a rockslide?
Superbrony64: PLAY BANJO TOOIE

Sumica: good question
IshBestPony: :[
alexxm: About the spell or about what SB is gonna play?
LOOK ITS WILSON
Meryl: I'd buy it. Two, maybe, because I have a brony friend that might want one.

CCCP what the fuck man?
You would have to play as Tootie to find Mumbo
Darkts3: i was going to say that xd

haha
/me kickes IshBestPony
Litwick: Actually that's british
thanks WindWhistler
CCCP whats the hells your problem?
Magical_pablez94: ........................you did not.....just say that......
The hats would be the hair, the eyes, and the cutie mark on the ear flaps
FOURTH WALL
11,02That spell was originally supposed to hit in the original design of the game to turn Banjo Kazooie into frogs and then I believe you had to play as Tootie in another quest to change them back.
IshBestPony: you are a mean pony!
CCCP how so
WindWhistler: i did.... nad i hope i didn't fail :D
<3 this music
/me is watching Top 100 Things to do in Walmart suckers
