10^
3dont worry its not too extreme
10(@val)
/me hugs Luna
also why not, i guess.
13Decap, you have no idea how hard this is gonna hit him
/me likes to be hugged
3not as hard as watching everyone he cares about being tortured infront of him
/me hugs Luna again for good measure
3that would be extreme
10...
10D:
3we are going to torture his family?
7~yay~
13No

13Compared to Herospirit you are Daz
13Lol
Hmm
15I feel like I've become a villain.
15And I'm cool with it.
AAAAAAA
15Also, I think my Olden Tounge powers have worn out.
AAAARRHAHAHahaaaa
15:[
13Thats just because we dont have Denied and Silvermare to encourage us
13Where are those foals.
13>.>
yea
Oh, yes
13Wat
when was the next book coming out again?
november. i cant wait.
13Daz
i'll get it for my bday in december. :)
13Silermare is the one writing the fanfic
That's the way you do it!
He's doing it wrong, the dumbass. yer supposed to lean forward with nosebleeds
13We absolutely need her in here.
Awww. . .
cool
silvermane is male, and silvermare is HIS female ponysona for RPing. you heard of what's gone down in 'silvershipper' over the past 2 months?
7brilliant
15I'm OUT OF THE LOOP.
basically, a LOT of r34 fics. silvermane wrote most of them too
Make it go back inn :D
LUNA
/me hugs Luna quickly before she goes away
LUNA!!!!!!
Dat ambience
13That.. Traitor.. Is among our greatest allies
/me hugs Luna
15I'm not sure. The lands of R34 are a foreign, terrifying place.
Luna is such hugable
and Pinkie_Pie do you know of the other silvershipper channel? the 'sister' channel?
(cuz if not i'd rather ask them if we show it or not :P)
yeah, I was really disappointed with the movie too
15HMMM?
13Eh, I think I went to it last night, but I forgot alot of things that happened last night
I usually am with book-movies, though
13I was to busy laughing like a maniac
lol
DON'T CALL BACK
ANY TIME
XD yeah
spyro movie?
"From the makers of Eragon" - I wouldn't boast about that
XD
13What?
MONEYGRAAAABUUUUHHH~
I'm thinking of redoing Pinkie's tail right about now...
I have no idea why anyone would think that would be a good idea
i didnt even hear about that one.
15*whispers* M'lady was having much with the spirits last eve.
the tail could be improved
_Especially_ from the makers of Eragon. :P
the hair is AWESOME though
PINKIES LIES?!?
/me ponypounces DecapPony
:3
13*whispers* "M'lady is 14

13>.>
*hic*

13*cough*
Pinkie_Pie is a 14 y/o?
now if it said from the author of eragon....
Yeah, there were rumors about it for years before they announced it was cancelled
different story
3who is 14?
13I am you foals.
13Problem?
13>.>
I doubt they even made it out of the Spyro fandom
3not really
3im 16
<3
What's the name of this song, Luna?
Not to my knowledge
resident evil?
15*whispers* her young, impressionable mind shall never be cleansed of the forces of Clop.
13Didnt Denied say he was 15?
or was tht the other way around?
13*whispers* Damn right
13Lol
3is denied a dude?
7indeed it is
i THINK aniway
15Am I the eldest in this land?
13Im not sure
Hmm
13You probably are Hero, you seem to be the most.. Reasonable
how old herospirit ?
3i can be reasonable
3i just choose not to be
I heard that movie was pretty bad
15I have survived 17 of the earth's rotations.
brb
mfw i'm oldest woohoo~
There's something like 4 RE films?
i liked the one i've seen
oh, really?
?
Shows how much I know about that
Yeah, I'd have thought they must be somewhat successful for that many to have been made.
later Daz
There've been four Resident Evil movies
Hmm.
3violet how old are you?
15We are ALL too young for this line of work. This puts my mind at ease; I believed myself the only one.
13> To young for this line of work
13> To young
13Lolno
According to wiki about the first film: "The film received many negative reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing more than $102 million worldwide"
i know bout the movies... i have two. the first and the last or third idk which.
15Pinkie, have ye no shame?
13Shame is for the weak
7drugs!
15My mind takes upon itself the shame of an entire nation.
ppl like zombies.
lol
3. 2. 1. Drop!
brb
7*smack*
15Quiet thineself, Decap.
Ok I did not see that coming :p
Hmm, the first film is a 6.4 on IMDb
3NEVER!
That's a negative.
15I weep for the shameless.
Maybe it's the exception that proves the rule.
/me 15weeps for the shameless
...and then my name was already in use...
3my mind is full of shame
3i just feel none of it
15I feel only shame. Only. Shame.
O_o
(OOC: @DecapPony I'm 20 years old~ )
I know the Halo film failed.
/me looks at names list
lol
Nope.avi RobotPinkieX
lol goddammit, now it logs me in automatically...
It was alright, but I feel it didn't live up to how good the games were.
<.<
gave back ground info and such and such.
lol
Get some blood from her stool!
13Does thine knight have a problem? >.<
15My self respect. It is gone. GONE, ALL OF IT
15MY SHAME GROWS ONLY STRONGER.
Dirty old House.
3self respect is bullshit
13Well go get it back, you need it
13Now, why?
nvr heard of timesplitters.
15I cannot regain my self respect, I lost it long ago.
They were a series of games on PS2.
3my guess, he has watched a lot of porn
13*facepalm*
13This argument must end now
15...
13We have more important matters to discuss
15Mayhaps in my younger years, Decap.
3we do?
15;]
13Yes, we do
13Like, where is Silvermane/mare
3like clopfics?
13No Decap, we can discuss that when Silvermare arrives
?
I gotta go
13@shamemeter Herospirit
6 Herospirit is 18% shame. (1616)
13See
13Not bad

13Rage
13Anyway

13Herospirit, we need something to do until more of our allies are here
3 14 year old writing a clopfic
13Im not writing it
13I would if I was a good writer
13=P
As in upcoming or genres or previous games?
idk... something u can suggest for a ps2 player?
I could try writing it. . . o:
Hmm
3i have a drivers license
and as far as doing something goes, synctube always works
Well I liked the Timesplitters games and they have good ratings, but on the whole you don't like FPS games?
13> Synchtube always works
right.
...I'd say something about needing mouth to mouth, but that'd just be wrong.
13And every time we did something went wrong
Just a tad
:)
HAI LUNA!
It's a good episode, though.
7hello DecapPony
She's on repeat.
13And its still there

LOL!!!!!
>mfw he cut the woman's call
I know she is not psychopath bc she's sick and it's a symptom of something else.
/me is listening to dude looks like a lady.
Wow....
"You know, she's NOT a guy"
"I'd like to be a guy"
>mfw SHE'S A FKING HERMAPHRODITE!!!!!
I thought psychopaths do not feel empathy and can use those close to them to further their own causes selfishly without remorse.
>mfw it makes sense with the jaw
>mfw I'd like to be in the corridor right now
This is hilarious.
EEEEEEYUP

13FINALLY
Fighting?
?me is listening to Mrs. Robinson
You can't have a discussion without it being called fighting?
What's that you say, Mr.Jayne_Cobb?
oh lawdy, dat wincest
7You seem like you're fighting
As I said.
It's impossible.
that isn't fighting. it's foreplay.
<Steven_Magnet>: Pinkie_Pie is Pinkie Pie
/me explodes
4But you can make it as clear as possible, and you clearly did not
It finally got it right
Dari, you said NO ONE DIES ON HOUSE
After 9001 tries
People have died on House
YOu're wrong
haha
The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
lol
that CAJ said! :P
:P
/me is with CAJ
/me is also with CAJ
There is nothing wrong with a discussion.
4I'm just saying that you cannot cover yourself when "Nobody ever dies in House" is meant to be an exaggeration when you presented it as a fact
4You gave absolutely no indication otherwise that it was an exaggeration
4Therefore
Lol, no.
at least you weren't banned!
4Lol yes
y
4And to me you stated it as a fact
you can just rejoin immediatley
also, back :P
It is not my fault that you did not see it the way I intended.
...immediately*
4You never indicated it as an exaggeration
you're nothing but a silly billy
7I'm too lazy to rejoin
I think there was ample implication.
7Yes, it's always open
4Where?
4Point it out
That's the way I interpret it.
4Point it out
7have a good sleep
4Show me where you had an implication that you were exaggerating
>"People never die on House"
>I know that people die on House
13Welcome, honored guest
>Everyone does, I would also assume
hai
4<prince-dari>: No one ever dies. <prince-dari>: In House.
>Therefore people would assume that I'm exaggerating in my eyes
pretty please
15I am here M'lady.
[22:03] No one ever dies.
[22:03] In House.
[22:03] :P
13Where to begin.
4I admit this is completely stupid, arguing over words on the net, but you cannot tell me that you're not wrong in the least
15We have a guest?
:(
The ":P" also indicates a joking or exaggerating manner.
13CAJ is Herospirit
4Your obtuseness is coming through again, dari :)
[22:16] The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
4And you always :P
15Yes, I know, M'lady.
4It lost it's meaning
who's gonna be the man?
You say I am obtuse, and you aren't?
I acknowledged that I was as to blame as you were, yet you still said.
4This is completely irrational
>yet
[22:17] <Ghosties> Therefore
dear lord this is the worst argument ever.
lol
7Alright, I'm going to rejoin. brb

We aren't throwing insults at each other.
We're just having a discussion. :/

"Pretty loud discussion." http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b329/jupitertronic2/4538385_ce78626d29_b.jpg
You can't have meaningful discussion in Ponychan?
You stated something as fact that was wrong
E_N: You clearly haven't read anything I've said.
50 joules? Bitch is the bionic woman
he's an evil enchantress...
13Evil Enchantress
13Lol

Meaningful is a subjective term...
sooo....watch out

he-hey! both turned to comment something at me, and it's quietened down! :3
15Are we requesting the help of CAJ?
13I knew it
I already explained expansively.
If you didn't bother to read it once I'm not going through the effort of reposting it for you to ignore it again.
13Just go back to watching Ponies I guess
13>.<
4Besides, I enjoy arguing with dari
How could he POSSIBLY misinterpret it?
you were WRONG
E_N: I refer you to the previously written statement
The statement which has been repeated several times, just for you.
:)
15We cannot merely leave our guest without proper information.
:I
7ohai WIlson
13Hmm
If olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from?
4Dari thinks he can put a ":P" and make it "exaggerated"
10yes we can
4Because that covers it, right?
4It wasn't to me
4Sure you can
hi everypony!
Everyone interprets things differently.
You could have capitalized the word ever
Yes there is
Then it's pretty clear you're exaggerating
A monocle
E_N: Different people would interpret that capitalisation in different ways.
see, you just did it
13Phone?
13...
It's emphasis.
13Who was in here E_N
There's a difference.
4Here's the situation: Dari said "Nobody ever dies in House," when people have died on House.
Though you may interpret it as exaggeration.
Which is my point.
'tis a joke Pinkie
13>.<
13I see

4HE DIDN'T SAY THE SAFETY WORD
WOAHHHHHHHH

Which is "Bananas"
i guess that's a good 'rape foreplay' as far as those go, but there are other kinds of foreplays

4I request Hercules
7Ghosties noted for tomorrow
Goes by the blogger name fagbutts
4Hercules is just an amazing show. I didn't realize that until a few years back when Sci Fi showed a marathon all day
i liked how they showed him growing in strength by having him pick up a horse every day from it's foalhood to adulthood
Anyway back on-topic. Should I go ahead and plan the interviews?
4Also, another great action series was Mortal Kombat Conquest
4But, I'm sure I'm the only one that believes that here >.>
wait... she's going to cause the fall of Lucifer?
Sure. Do you have my availability on hand?
4FUCK
Versus Kelly and Alicia
4@Apok: It's more common than you think
4And besides, the first film was great too
i mean, i have respect for her...
MK: Defenders of Earth was pretty bad, but it was the enjoyable type of bad.
Shall I just go ahead and post them on the forums?
Well, My availability may actually be changing soon
Oh, do tell
oh, the enjoyable type of bad
But for now, yeah, I'll make the last interview for sure and perhaps some of the one before it
4Bleh, a divas match?
Great.
4BRB bathroom break
I'll get on it now
Kelly and Alicia are decent.
Cool
4Kelly's like the female Cena

14what a loser... :(
Xena. That is all explanation you need
O.o

Xena seems pretty selfish and, frankly, evil this episode
it corrupted her heart. Or something
7goo!

Interesting pause

someone stopped the stream to talk to us?
2,14 it's kinda sad that they're trying to make us sympathize with Lucifer...considering I want the angels to win right now :P
oh no, it knocked her back
I think they want us to consider that Lucifer's fall isn't all his fault
JUDO CHOP
15OhGogWe'reSoLonely
2,14 it also depends on the mythology
14lol

2,14 lol Caj, well NOW I am :P
Yes. yes, you are.
Hey guise
and promptly died on the last level with permadeath on.
Daleks are elite soldiers. Cybermen are faceless armies of soldiers
>mfw THE SON
It kind of evens out.
2,14 well whatever the case, I think it's best we not discuss such things ;)
thanks
They could climb stairs. Took YEARS for the daleks to figure that one out.
2,14 :P
3dari why you gotta hate?
lol that autoscript
hey Silvermane you want to get out of here?

Meh, replicators can't touch daleks.
Epic shields. :P

2,14 whoopsie
I want a Droid but they're too expensive over here
Got this cause it's affordable
Also all data throttling in this country is terribad except for BBs, cause everyone has one here
Val: it has no Ctrl Key though. I'm guessing you meant Ctrl + K?
2,14 for the first part, yes. But if you have any way of copying a message and pasting it I think we can get it to work
yeah I have ways to do so....just not in-client
2,14 not in client then? Damn...
wait lemme try something
@11
@11 I am Gendum
Bleh
2,14 :- /
Gonna keep trying
./)*3*(\
Alright, I think I'm out for tonight, planning on showing up tomorrow
Night, everypony :3
later mate
2,14 happens :P
Forgot I was in here after the sound cut out.
Shame that, but seeing as the odd hours the mods keep here it's bound to happen.
2,14 oh well
2,14I can't promise anything, as it hasn't been discussed at all. For now at least, it's looking like "no".
2,14With that being said, anything can change
No worries, was just wondering as they seem to still be looking for S2 streamers/mods.
2,14Fair enough
both positions are not mutually inclusive, though
were you wishing to apply for a streamer position?
1-2 iirc
higher than mine
I have 0.99 Mbps
and I stream just fine
it's a matter of technique
in any case, check http://speedtest.net
.7 is good enough
you need .614 for an HQ stream
yeah.
you DO?
and The Hub?
still a capture card is a capture card
...Yeah
it should run just fine
you're pretty much hired by now if you want to be a streamer
I'll be available from 10 AM EST to 4 PM EST
damn
2,14I have no idea, let me see if I can dig up some info
saterday the 17th at 8am
is the first run of the show
then again at 6pm iirc
PST
2,14wb decappony
hey Decap
hey
2,14hmmmm
http://www.nickandmore.com/2011/08/23/the-hubs-fall-schedule-first-look-batman-the-animated-series-goosebumps-join/
have to put the card in the case and reinstall software.
Also is it 8 AM EST?
I belive the times on the site saif pst
2,14 that's a good question...I have no idea
want me to just check the guide on my cable?
please do
they drive me to waking up early on the only day I can sleep in

feh, the schudule onle goes up 9-5
2,14 DecapPony: Fuggin saved
Val, please investigate for me
13It costs me 400,000 bits to play my cello for 12 seconds...
yeah i need to go and get a capture card first
same with the one on Hubs site.
getting easycap is the economic option
it cost 1,000 bits per second to use my machete
wait
Thought it was Activia
13Hey Decap
ow i just cut my hand open....'
well if Sathi or Dari or even Sprinks get online
2,14<.< >.>
13Well, with everyone shouting my name... lol
13lol
2,14Dari just went to bed...say...40 minutes ago?
2,14That we can do :P
in any case
well its after 10pm....
maybe we could go full retard and have an HD Quality, an SD HQ Stream and an SD LQ Stream
negitive, I was checking prices on them as we talking though
2,14That'd be pretty ballin
I thought you already had a capture card?
I do, it's just not HD =p
kay I really should go sleep now LOL
Night erryponi
2,14dream of many fighting robots :P
2,14with ponies piloting them :P
2,14After all, we wouldn't want anyone spending money only to find out *something* doesn't work
i can run FME and only have CPU usage at 20 to 30%
well I would still use the card. I watch shows on my psp on breaks
13*ddr2 ram
13Playing ponies on all the bluetooth projectors would be pretty cool :D
2,14None that I can think of my friend :P
at least outside of PrincessMolestia's world
13;)
Seeing as the guys that set up the projectores know noting about secureing bluetooth connections.
/me 13gives the best gifts
2,14>mfw S2's pilot episode is just this orgasmic mayhem of everything we've been hoping for
/me 13gives the gift of "friendship". The best gift there is, right? :D
2,14Well, I'll be satisfied if they keep a consistent quality as season 1
2,14of course, if that bitch Trixie makes even ONE appearance I'll blow a gasket
....I just realized something. We went from my just making conversation about you getting to stream or not to oh hey I might be streaming S2 =p
2,14 lol
2,14Well honestly that's a good thing :P
13Did they finally confirm it?
2,14Sumica: Link or it didn't happen
SHOW US ZE LINK!
13I saw someone say vaguely, but it wasnt an actual confirmation.
feh, hold on let me go dig back thru that interview.
2,14lame...apparently color doesn't work with /me
Val you lier!
.avi
2,14at least, on mIRC
I thought you said you gave up the trident!
13lol
2,14And I also said that I sleep with it at night because it makes me feel safe :P
You know they conform noting but hint at everything =p
'parties
13Well, I have a friend on the show, and I know some things others dont. :P
2,14O_o
2,14*Rarity Voice* TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME!
And by were, I of course mean are.
13lol I cant Val. And anything I can a little, I hint at in my comments on EqD once in a while when its appropriate. :P
/me 13likes to be whipped though
13Octavia would just shy away like Fluttershy. :P
2,14And then I'll make you tell me!
2,14What can I say? I like watching people :P
unfortunately for you she likes that kind of thing
13It was a hint, vaguely, but not a confirmation really. :P
2,14On an unrelated note...English classes are the best
FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
2,14First assignment? Read Beowulf: Me gusta
2,14Of course...I've already read it...but hey I like it enough to reread it :P
13Bueno
2 minutes to do the assignments
2,14Phffff, math can suck it :P
THIS CALLS FOR A BATTLE!
13lol
13Battle of The Subjects
2,14Lol, that would be quite the battle
2,14Sorry Decap. You can't. Unfortunately you can't speak to anyone without english :P

*russian
chinese

spanish
2,14>Implying you know all of those
2,14>and further implying that you get to bring other fields with you
2,14mwahahaha! I win :P
13lol
/me still hates the thought of a trixie reappearance
/me 13thinks about a Trixie reappearance

/me cries
no doubles, and one of them was mane 6 :3
/me lowers his head
I'm sorry :(
You know you can check the numbers to know which pony you're getting.
They didn't have them two weeks ago, though, I just checked because I was in the area
...you can?
Which numbers? :o
I don't even HAVE 4 technically. just those 2 sets, and the show's /now/ /under/ /way/ in Italy, but not here yet D:
as you can see, no.3 is RD
aaaaaand yes, fffuuuu Fluttershy
AHA!
Y U NO LINK MEEEEEEE
(the 'here' isn't linked) :(
lol
wai Daz?
wai. well, according to something i read bfore
Oh...
because then I'm definitely doing that...
haha
yea just looking for that post
there is more somewhere, lemme keep googl'ing
lol I can't find it either
: /.

otherwise I'll just have to go look at the numbers until I catch 'em all :P
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/merch/res/34422.html
hmm
:P
It seems like 24 would be a reasonable assumption
please answer
how much is it for a set of 2 ponies where you are? and how much is a blindbag?
(i need to know how much they'd be for Spain :P)
a blindbag is about €2
set of two ponies, I haven't seen.
...TWO?!? YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Single ponies are about €8
yeah, I did
ummm... both?

Oh my, I've seen that anime
Same thing, E_N
gurren lagann 'killed' most animes for me. i always watch first 3 eps to see if i like a show, but it's been AGES since i watched a full anime cuz it just isn't as good : /
Well, the feeling for me, that is
I only ever read manga now
it's the one where each character is a country of europe from around the time of the first world war, right?
or something like that
and now we're on this topic, a few videogames killed most, because of how good those few i played were :D
haven't played it yet, but want to
okay, tail's set in place.

I dunno Daz, I think some service providers block you from switching boot screen
not working for me,, guess i'll have to root my phone
Ive done it...
It dosenot work!
doesn't madponyking ?
Sry mistyped
madponyking, are you saying that the custom boot screens, which have many replies saying how well it worked, do not work? if not , : /
