Not here, ValtheJean
It sucks.
13Its weird, thats for sure
/me 10didn't mean to make the reference
13I have no opinion on it though

I think it's probably that the colors are wrong in my IRC client, lol
/me hoofs Decap~
3I GOTS COLORS!
STREAM, R.U.B.C.? U. ಠ_ರೃ B.C., R.U.B.C.?
13So, Violet
ValtheJean: you have awesome colours, dude
13Are you good with secrets? You dont seem like the kind of person I would tell such confidential information
?
2,14 why thank you daz, at least SOMEONE can read them :P
What do you mean?
I've been typing all the time.
I can read your colours val :)
10xD
Just trying out an IRC client

7Yea, Sathi needed to leave
Wow, Luna
2,14 quick! hug her before she leaves us again!
and ValtheJean the orange background looks awesome, why not use it?
1000 years flys by when you dont think about it
2,14 /me hugs luna
/me hugs Luna quickly
You know where sathi left to? you know where you can find her?
/me hugs Luna
2,14 gah
/me hugs luna
Anything you say to me I will take into confidence that it will never leave my fingers or lips without your permission.
7She's taking a shower
Sathi and Luna... aren't the same person?
7i'm taking over
My brain is full of fuck
ValtheJean: there's no need for a space after you use your colourthingy
3what about your eyes?
13Even if it involves crushing someones soul?
my brain is full of shower
just saiyan
2,14 yeah I know, it was a natural reaction
hahaha
eh, i'm in bronystate rite now aniways
2,14 stupid English Major making me put spaces....
/me hugs Luna
HAI AGAIN LUNA!
y u no kick logic out? just type man
Even if it involves crushing someone's soul. . . D; though that'd be really saaaaddddddd >:
Why are you all hugging luna?
Luna's colors aren't as nice in xchat :(
Apokalipse, so she won't leave again :3
I'll stick to mibbit
2,14 it's too hard, I like being elitist >.<
Why would someone want to crush another's soul? ;A;
77 why not
10^
13Val the Arch Demon
3dont worry its not too extreme
13A tyrant who must be crushed.
10(@val)
/me hugs Luna
also why not, i guess.
13Decap, you have no idea how hard this is gonna hit him
2,14 Rainbrodash: *brohoof*
13It will change the face of the earth for him
/me likes to be hugged
3not as hard as watching everyone he cares about being tortured infront of him
/me hugs Luna again for good measure
13Thats pretty much what we are doing
3that would be extreme
10...
10D:
3we are going to torture his family?
7~yay~
13No
13We are going to torture his steed
13Lol
3he has a horse?
13*cough*
2,14 O_o
13Caramel
13*cough*
omagad

Me too RP
7spoilers?
WAit what
/me hugs DecapPony
Just torture others in front of him? o:
Rarity with a colt and a child?
13No
No spoilers, they're sketches from S1 it looks like
2,14 that isn't rarity :P
no really, just pics of ponies
How sure are you?
/me 13is to tired to explain it again
13Dear god, Herospirit..
2,14 because she has Pinkie Pie's hair :P
..
13WHERE ARE YOU?!
3should we just tell vanilla?
All the others are mane character sketches though.
Exactly
13Idk
2,14 not the manticore :P
I. . . am so confused. . . o^o
and I'm pretty sure that's Mr and Mrs Sparkle with young filly Twilight :P
All the ponies.
Oh.
2,14 plus, these were probably pre production
13I need Herospirit, Denied, Silvermare, or E_T
2,14 originally fluttershy was going to be an earth pony, and pinkie pie was going to be a pegasus
3why?

Nah these are production sketches, not concept art.

My understanding so far. . .
Val is a tyrant
3correct
Pinkie Pie wants him destroyed/tortured
/me 10already understands the plan
3yes
A plan is unfolding for which this will happen.
bubble party? :O
3yes
You guys are so mean to Val.
13I need one of them on to help me organize this
3what did i do?
13Silvermare and Denied are writers
Only I get to troll him.

3anyways, violet we are going to write a fic featuring caramel
7Dari?
sadly, it isn't on youtube. only ytpoops of it, and crappy camrecorded vids of it : /. but it involves a guy who removes his shades, only to have shades underneath, bubbles, sesame seeds, and mustaches.
7When can I start my broadcast from the moon?
Guns don't kill people, uh uh! I kill people, with guns!
-logs onto Brony State-

;_;
Ok nvm. I'm just not paying enough attention.. :p
13And heres the best part. We are gonna try to get it on EQD
13And Prince is gonna try to read it to him on livestream
suddenly Luna channels the powers of RainBroDash and NewDCD
I approve!
13Excellent
13Now, you must not tell anyone.
13Ok?
3is this going to be SFW or NSFW?
NSFW
It has to be.
@pony The pony RainBroDash wubs the most in the whole wide world
6 The pony RainBroDash wubs the most in the whole wide world is 8Sapphire 12Sh11or12es
"Sha-heem on you!"
We must infiltrate his mind. . .
Spare no details. . .
*sigh*
y u no appplefritter?
Where is Denied_Existence?
7it's magic I aint gonna explain it
eyedunnolawl
3ok, you are now scaring me Violet
I need his craftmanship
lol
13Its going to be a clopfic
;3 I've had a few ex's that I made pay. . . I know how it's done. . .
RainBroDash, you know this to be true!
13This is highly confidental
13https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwZlVb4mVuhdysMxk7U1UQThUt38mX_sF-8fHG5bDuc/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1

Nothing shall leave this room, I guarantee it! c;
oh dear
13So, RainBroDash
Ah well, can't win 'em all
Why oh dear?
13What do you think?
RainBro's gay.
cuz it's not applefritter or colgate, his 2 fave ponies?
I don't think that's how it works...
3this is going to be a great troll fic
Some of the Skype quotes make it pretty clear.
2,14 obviously it's because AppleBloom hasn't had "the talk" yet
Makes sense, ValtheJean
4oh gosh oh man
k, back to physics...
13RainBroDash?~
makes perfect sence
7streams up
7Pokemon will start SOON
I C dat :P
Why do you guys want to do this to Val anyway?
13It started out as a joke that he was a Tyrant
13I opened this channel as a safe haven
13And then our arms got long and curly
13And we started to plot evil
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l9bssvphCr1qdprjio1_500.jpg
O_o
4kinda like one of those trippy drug ads in the 80s
2,14 mfw I had random disconnect
Hot.

13That will work.
GOTTA CATCH EM ALL POKEMON!!
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skoWq27KYeE
13Kinda forget about him, and I dont want him to have a link he could potentially give to Val
...that's just incorrect
should be '*** ValtheJean was impaled by ValtheImpaler (double)
2,14 how bout I impale you? :P
GARRYYYYMOOOOON!!!
Sounds wrong ValtheImpaler
Your more of an evil tyrant in my eyes now.
2,14 you're* :P
lolol
and a grammar nazi
And now your a grammar nazi
ValtheJean, you would impale your loyal follower?
your? >_
>_< *
2,14 wait, last time I said that you claimed you WEREN'T my loyal follower! MAKE UP YOUR MIND!
@pony The pony most likely to help ValtheJean impale people
6 The pony most likely to help ValtheJean impale people is 13Pinkie 4Pie
2,14 icanlivewiththat.jpg
Seems pretty accurate.
Fixed
ValtheJean: i said 'don't call me a 'minion' ' basically
2,14 ah, I see
Loyal follower here :P
HAI WEEDLE!
a WEEDUL
13Loyal follower, you say?
ah sorry forgot
2,14 NO NOT THE WEEDULS, NOT THE WEEDULS! AHHHHH
13We are still here, always watching your every move
Leg humpin'

NEENJA
Basically, this show is about cool animal abuse is.
13I see
10Pinkie I was afk ;_____;
*how cool
13RainBroDash
10I completely support this trolling attempt, it sounds hilarious
I don't agree with the message...
lawl
13Meh
13You swear?
10as long as it stays in good humour ofc :P
10ofc ^^

10I already had the link
...RainBroDash i'm afraid i'd have tos ay that 'dman x silvermane' wasn't in good humour imo ... D: that fic will burn my brain out for eternity
7Samurai
10you kicked me, it didn't remove the link xD
10and daz you love it
2,14 dat samurai needs to take some serious lessons on bushido
ty for link, Pinkie_Pie, and RainBroDash, I have nothing to say
He broke the rules...
He looks a little chubby for a samurai..
2,14 particularly the ones about not assaulting people with your sword
13What are you going to use that link for, Daz?
13-.-
>google doccs has a new look
and Pinkie_Pie i'm not gonna spoil it dude! have faith
I'm working on a quick assignment for Uni, just so you know. . . it's due later this evening so if I don't reply I'm working on this~

13Im getting a headache trying to organize all of this by myself
2,14 >have a bird against a bug
2,14 >stay on the ground
13Silvermare is the one writing it btw
silvermane is the master of bronystate brony shipping
2,14 >profit?
menopause?
and doesn't surprise me Pinkie_Pie. also, cuz you seemed new (^_^ welcome) silvermane was his original, and then he made 'pizzapony,' a pony who delivers pizzas to us :P and then he made 'silvermare' to be able to RP / fanfic with other males, basically. lawl
7lol
Fail
lolol
7this is gonna take a while
2,14 >maximum hardness
ikr
wow
What happens when an unactable force meets an unactable object? xD

RobotPinkie: your fave pkmn ?
Almost my favorite pokemon :P

I think Torchic is the cutest one, and that's pretty important in my book...
:3.
2,14 welp, it is time for some classes. I'll bbl bronies
Fuck Blaziken, I'm gonna keep that Torchic from evolving no matter what, basically :P

13No idea how he is gonna pull that off
hahaha
YEAH
mfw when I remember getting a metapod to evolve early on was a pain in the arse
>"put them to sleep"
Mass murder is what it is.
13Lol
13Last night, everyone was in here
13The mane chat was abandoned
13And only Val and another mod were talking
ah
13Val started to talk about how quiet it had gotten
I feel like a douchebag right now, my rep at CDW is such a great guy
But I haven't purchased shit from them in a while, all I get are quotes :p
Pinkie_Pie, who's /your/ fave pony?
13Hmm
13Rainbow Dash, but if mane 6 doesnt count

Sounds about right
7RTFM!
oh, this is the first ep of The IT Crowd? Yessssss
4wouldn't it be ironic if someone actually had a real pony and that was their favorite pony?
7yes it is
13It would be unacceptable
13Lol, Jk
I'll bbs
13I guess it would be ironic
real ponies don't have personalities as FiM ponies do :P
4"i don't feel right accepting this"

Yep

which is why I'm here :P
haha, oh wow
Oh god, I'm in tears...
Accounting, literature/arts, web programming, database, statistics, and theory of computation
in other words, all of my classes yesterday and today
<.<
Why
from the laughing
eep, thts a whole lotta stuff.... O.O
yeah, none of it is very hard, though, since it's just the beginning of the year
yeah
oh look, she's joined the Ministry of Silly Walks.
just a lot of reading and busy work
that did it for me
lol
I loled out too loud
five finger fillet
maybe for someone who knows computers.... i dont understand a good bit of tht list.
I'M FAIRLY SURE I DID.. Fairly.. :p
sup AllisZero. I only played the first 2 hours of Xenoblade so far, but i guess if you like that sort of thing, you'll like this :P. yea...that's as much as I can say rly, barely played it. You still thinking of getting it?
neither do I actually :P
I only just had the first classes yesterday and today
best of luck to you.
now what the heck, the internet on my other computer won't work -_-
thanks
I'll see Daz, I hear Skyward Sword is coming out in November, so I'll have to see what my gaming budget is going to look like
computers dont like me.
they hate me XD
I'm always having computer problems
/me is a techno jinx 90% of the time.
lol
HAHAHAHHAHHAA
HAHA, oh wow
hehehehehehe
I fuckin lold again
skywardsword and (hatersgonnahate) AC:Revelations are the 2 games i want for the rest of 2011, and i'll be honest, since january, i've wanted skyward sword the most :P
...3
Fuck this is awesome! I'll just put it over here with the rest of the fire.
meh
wireless must be down
OH ONE ONE EIGHT NINENINENINE. ... can't remember the rest

SEVEN TWO FIIIIIIIVE ... THREE

0118 999 881 999 119 725.........3
ah thanks RobotPinkie, i remembered the ending at least :P
Yeah, I know, daz, I need to play TP before though
Well thankfully it's a fairly easy number to remember
Now instead of accounting or web systems homework I get to read stuff from textbooks, yay!
i guess. AllisZero, as i'm sure you know it's that basically with impressionism art for looks / models :3. but uh, they aren't direct sequels or anything, so personally i'd make SS priority ; )
...wow, what a gift
this is about the only thing i do on a comp anymore. other than itunes and homework. i like to read...
What a story mark(!)
just not a text book
HAHA
GOJIRA mitai

This is too funny

Haha yeah I'll be back at night when I'm off
See you guys in a few
Byes

I'm alright thanks, just got back from France for a wedding, which was good.

herospirit: you can type '/join' followed by channel. i.e. for this channel '/join #bunker' or perhaps '/join #bronystate' for bronystate
Alright, thank you Daz. :]
Pinkie_Pie: mods explain the same stuff a Lot more :P
13No sign of Denied or Sivlermare yet

thanks, I think I'll just look it up at the library if I get the chance, though :)
: D
the male pinkie pie from the fanfic 'cross and arrow' where mane6 cross over to a parallel world where all males are females, and vice versa
That's awesome, I'd like to have friends like Moss
/me 13hates having to keep a bookmark of Cross and Arrow

15:3

13Also, the registering thing isnt for Bronystate only
13It is for any channel that uses Epic chats

Oh, yes

I like how she said earlier she didn't want to get beaten to death by him using a shoe.
>Bunker filled with a few others >we don't have [two users] to encourage us. Wat indeed
november. i cant wait.
And he beat's up a clown with his own shoe
13Daz
i'll get it for my bday in december. :)
13Silermare is the one writing the fanfic
That's the way you do it!
He's doing it wrong, the dumbass. yer supposed to lean forward with nosebleeds
13We absolutely need her in here.
Awww. . .
cool
15You, my fair knight, do not understand the powers Of Lords Silvermare and Denied.
Forever alone
Yup, that's true Daz
I might have to read the other books again so I can remember what happened :P
silvermane is male, and silvermare is HIS female ponysona for RPing. you heard of what's gone down in 'silvershipper' over the past 2 months?
7brilliant
15I'm OUT OF THE LOOP.
basically, a LOT of r34 fics. silvermane wrote most of them too
Make it go back inn :D
Oh my god.. Brilliant.
herospirit you're just new, i can fill you in if you care to ask about anything
LUNA
13> Mfw I realise that Dashite is the owner of silvershipper
/me hugs Luna quickly before she goes away
LUNA!!!!!!
Dat ambience
13That.. Traitor.. Is among our greatest allies
/me hugs Luna
Luna won't you cry for meeee~~ I'm as lonely as i've ever beeeeen ~~~
lol yeah, i done that a yr too soon. i cant believe they butched the 1st movie so bad. they almost made a second one but nope.
15I'm not sure. The lands of R34 are a foreign, terrifying place.
Luna is such hugable
dashite and polarfire rule silvershipper
15I may brave a question when I work up my courage, M'lord.
did you take any Flootershai pics yet, Daz?
and Pinkie_Pie do you know of the other silvershipper channel? the 'sister' channel?
(cuz if not i'd rather ask them if we show it or not :P)
yeah, I was really disappointed with the movie too
15HMMM?
13Eh, I think I went to it last night, but I forgot alot of things that happened last night
I usually am with book-movies, though
13I was to busy laughing like a maniac
Thank God they cancelled the Spyro movie. :P
lol
DON'T CALL BACK
ANY TIME
XD yeah
I'VE ALREADY HAD YOUR KIND
spyro movie?
"From the makers of Eragon" - I wouldn't boast about that
XD
THIS IS YOUR PAYBACK
13What?
MONEYGRAAAABUUUUHHH~
I'm thinking of redoing Pinkie's tail right about now...
3HAI VIOLET!
I have no idea why anyone would think that would be a good idea
i didnt even hear about that one.
RobotPinkie got back recently, FS is infront of me with hair ready for hot water, pics taken, but not all pics yet. waiting for dinner, then after dinner. and i'm so sorry it's taken me so long, it's just i've had to go out erry day, some days twice ,to see like, lawyers, civil guard peoples, organising a ton of parental ownership stuff
15*whispers* M'lady was having much with the spirits last eve.
the tail could be improved
_Especially_ from the makers of Eragon. :P
the hair is AWESOME though
PINKIES LIES?!?
/me ponypounces DecapPony

13*whispers* "M'lady is 14

13>.>
*hic*

13*cough*
Pinkie_Pie is a 14 y/o?
now if it said from the author of eragon....
Yeah, there were rumors about it for years before they announced it was cancelled
different story
Btw it wasn't Tabitha St. Germain who voiced normal Luna, was it?
13Anyway, what do we do until Silvermare arrives?
3who is 14?
13I am you foals.
13Problem?
13>.>
I doubt they even made it out of the Spyro fandom
We write happy ponyfics~
3not really
3im 16
15*wwhispers* M'lady is much too young for this "shipping" line of work. It is no place for a filly.
Nice! watsup, kid? That's so awesome!
<3
13*whispers* Nonsense, I have been on the internet since 8 years old
Has a film based on a game ever been a success?
It's no problem, Daz, take your time with it.
What's the name of this song, Luna?
3ive been on the internet since i was 3
Not to my knowledge
resident evil?
15*whispers* her young, impressionable mind shall never be cleansed of the forces of Clop.
RobotPinkie: pinkie's lies, like i said i think
13Didnt Denied say he was 15?
or was tht the other way around?
13*whispers* Damn right
13Lol
3is denied a dude?
7indeed it is
i THINK aniway
15Am I the eldest in this land?
Ah okay, didn't know you said the song title :P
It had been a long day, or thus was how it seemed, Celestia's sun hung in the sky like a flaming beach ball. The heat bearing down on Sweet Apple Acres, scorching the workers out bucking apples.
13Im not sure
Hmm
13You probably are Hero, you seem to be the most.. Reasonable
BRB dinner y'all
how old herospirit ?
3i can be reasonable
3i just choose not to be
13But, age is simply a number. It means nothing in the field of maturity
sorry RobotPinkie ;___;. aniways dinner then flootershai
I heard that movie was pretty bad
15I have survived 17 of the earth's rotations.
brb
mfw i'm oldest woohoo~
There's something like 4 RE films?
aniways g2g brb dinner
i liked the one i've seen
oh, really?
?
So she voiced both Lunas?
Shows how much I know about that
what?
Yeah, I'd have thought they must be somewhat successful for that many to have been made.
later Daz
There've been four Resident Evil movies
Hmm.
The weather would have been any for a normal summer, but this was mid-September, in Ponyville nonetheless, it shouldn't have been this hot.
3violet how old are you?
15We are ALL too young for this line of work. This puts my mind at ease; I believed myself the only one.
idk what u guys r tlkin bout.
13> To young for this line of work
13> To young
13Lolno
According to wiki about the first film: "The film received many negative reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing more than $102 million worldwide"
3im too young for a lot of the stuff i do
Alas, it was, and Big Macintosh, Apple Jack, Caramel, and the rest of the earth ponies bucking around the farm were feeling the heat as it penetrated through the trees.
i know bout the movies... i have two. the first and the last or third idk which.
15Pinkie, have ye no shame?
13Shame is for the weak
7drugs!
Red herring or not?
15My mind takes upon itself the shame of an entire nation.
3i like your attitude pinkie
ppl like zombies.
lol
3. 2. 1. Drop!
FFFFFUUUU flash froze on me
brb
7*smack*
"Ah, sure can't believe this here heat!" Apple Jack exclaimed, whipping her legs out in a quick buck sending a loud crack into the air as shiny red and green apples fell from the branches high above.
15Quiet thineself, Decap.
Ok I did not see that coming :p
Hmm, the first film is a 6.4 on IMDb
3NEVER!
That's a negative.
So I suppose that's fairly successful since it did well commercially.
15I weep for the shameless.
Maybe it's the exception that proves the rule.
/me 15weeps for the shameless
...and then my name was already in use...
3my mind is full of shame
3i just feel none of it
"Eeeyup." Macintosh replied, lost in his own bucking work halfway down the row of trees. "When you said you're gunna be tryin' to do this yerself ah knew ah couldn't letcha."
my lil brother actually found a halo anime series.
15I feel only shame. Only. Shame.
O_o
(OOC: @DecapPony I'm 20 years old~ )
I know the Halo film failed.
/me looks at names list
7you should be able to pick your own name now
lol
It was too expensive so they cancelled it or something.
Nope.avi RobotPinkieX
13My, what a suprise
I don't know how the Prince Of Persia film did.
lol goddammit, now it logs me in automatically...
It was alright, but I feel it didn't live up to how good the games were.
/me 13had imagined Violet as an 8 year old typing rainbow pixels into our "Bunker"
<.<
Go die in a cart crash.
the halo one was a 1 hour anime full of lil episodes
3no, an 8 year old would of asked what a clop fic was
I'm a filly, and wat is this?
13The inner workings of trolling
gave back ground info and such and such.
3the death of your childhood
That's better...
lol
15the death of my self respect.
I know what a clop fic is .-.
/me didnt pay attention cuz shes not a halo fan.
Get some blood from her stool!
13Hero, what do you mean.
13Does thine knight have a problem? >.<
15My self respect. It is gone. GONE, ALL OF IT
Hmm, I've never really played Halo, but from what I've seen it looks a bit like timesplitters, just not as good. :P
15MY SHAME GROWS ONLY STRONGER.
Dirty old House.
3self respect is bullshit
13Well go get it back, you need it
13Now, why?
nvr heard of timesplitters.
15I cannot regain my self respect, I lost it long ago.
heya VampirePrincess
They were a series of games on PS2.
3my guess, he has watched a lot of porn
TimeSplitters is a 2000 first-person shooter developed by Free Radical Design, now known as Crytek UK and published by Eidos, and the first game in the TimeSplitters series. It was released 26 October 2000 as a PlayStation 2 launch game. The game revolves around the concept of travelling through time in a story mode spanning 100 years. The game features a story mode, arcade mode, unlockable challenge mode, and map maker.
13*facepalm*
"TimeSplitters received mostly positive reviews and ranks as the 6th highest scoring first-person shooter game released on PlayStation 2 with an average review score of 84.54%[1]."
13This argument must end now
15...
13We have more important matters to discuss
15Mayhaps in my younger years, Decap.
3we do?
15;]
13Yes, we do
13Like, where is Silvermane/mare
i dont like shooter games. except left 4 dead and left 4 dead 2
3like clopfics?
13Or, where is Val the Arch Demon
13No Decap, we can discuss that when Silvermare arrives
3yeah i know what you mean herospirit
?
I gotta go
13@shamemeter Herospirit
6 Herospirit is 18% shame. (1616)
13See
13Not bad
15Quite wrong indeed.
15But enough of my shame
15What plans have we?
3@shamemeter DecapPony
6 DecapPony is 60% shame. (1617)
3damn i have a fuck ton of shame
13@shamemeter Pinkie_Pie
6 Pinkie_Pie is 75% shame. (1618)
so dari what games u interested in?
13Rage
13Anyway
3im not supprised about that
13Herospirit, we need something to do until more of our allies are here
3 14 year old writing a clopfic
13Im not writing it
13I would if I was a good writer
13=P
As in upcoming or genres or previous games?
idk... something u can suggest for a ps2 player?
I could try writing it. . . o:
Hmm
13Anyway, the next person to judge me or anyone else based on age gets a boot in the face
3i have a drivers license
and as far as doing something goes, synctube always works
Well I liked the Timesplitters games and they have good ratings, but on the whole you don't like FPS games?
13> Synchtube always works
right.
/me thinks the chat needs CPR
13It gave me and Meteor so many daymares yesterday
13It took so long to get a working room
...I'd say something about needing mouth to mouth, but that'd just be wrong.
13And every time we did something went wrong
What genres do you like?
Just a tad
:)
HAI LUNA!
It's a good episode, though.
7hello DecapPony
She's on repeat.
13And its still there

Wow...
Finally, jesus.
So does House's karma ever really catch up with him?
3http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-be-afraid-of-sweetie-belle.jpg

"Shadow of the Colossus is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of videogames.[12] In 2010, gaming critic IGN named Shadow of the Colossus the second best game of the decade, behind Half-Life 2. "
4especially since it covers up some of the image instead of going under it and also because my duplicate detector probably won't see it as a duplicate

/facepalm

LUNA IS 3rd BEST STREAMER
RobotPinkie, I have a question
I'm pretty sure it's been like that throughout the whole series, hasn't it?
(1st is a tie between Dari and DCD)
Please accept invite
House =/= Doctor who. House > Doctor Who, Dermathil
15You have summoned thine robotic self?
:D

grrrr Daz.
:|
13RobotPinkie, do you still have that google doc open?
4time to do battle much like sonic
7don't forget Pokemon!
13We are trying to figure out who this one Anon is
robotpinkamena is one helluva mare, herospirit. only showed up like twice before, but watch out for that one
whuh? I haven't even been linked to a google doc
7Xena and the IT crowd
Tennant is best Doctor, and that includes House. :P
13Hmm
Presumably you want to keep it that way.
DARI!!!!!
/me lurks

That's not what that is WhatPayne
/me is part of the nicest community in the world

LOL!!!!!
>mfw he cut the woman's call
I know she is not psychopath bc she's sick and it's a symptom of something else.
WhatPayne, I mean a psychopath isn't that kind of stuff.
/me is listening to dude looks like a lady.
Wow....
"You know, she's NOT a guy"
"I'd like to be a guy"
>mfw SHE'S A FKING HERMAPHRODITE!!!!!
I thought psychopaths do not feel empathy and can use those close to them to further their own causes selfishly without remorse.
>mfw it makes sense with the jaw
>mfw I'd like to be in the corridor right now
This is hilarious.
EEEEEEYUP

13: Channel access to #Bunker for E_N unchanged.
15Alright, so in here?

13I guess in stream for a bit
noooooooo not the cheeeeeeeeeeeeeese!
13Since we are waiting on people

4Wow...what a complete douche
4I love House
7^^
And the friend in MI3 party scene
"A statement that represents something as better or worse than it really is"
7Wrestlers ARE awesome
That's what my sentence did. :P
4Nobody ever dies in House
4It was stated as a fact
@pony The pony that House will harvest organs from
6 The pony that House will harvest organs from is 14Hoity-15Toity
>A statement
And he was also in L.A Noire
4Stated as a fact
except her
10indeed
"4A statement2,15 that represents something as better or worse than it really is"
4You didn't indicate that it was an exaggeration. Also, this is the internet; you can't read tone over letters
House is an asshole.
Yeah. But he get's the job done I guess
He's very much the definition of chaotic good
7just a little..
7hm
heh
Well, not my fault you made an assumption. :P
PINGAS

HAHA, nice one

10thats about right
13FINALLY
Fighting?
?me is listening to Mrs. Robinson
You can't have a discussion without it being called fighting?
What's that you say, Mr.Jayne_Cobb?
oh lawdy, dat wincest
7You seem like you're fighting
As I said.
me is keeping chat alive for luna!
Whatever I do I cannot assure that what I say will be interpretted the way I intend.
It's impossible.
that isn't fighting. it's foreplay.
/me explodes
4But you can make it as clear as possible, and you clearly did not
It finally got it right
Dari, you said NO ONE DIES ON HOUSE
After 9001 tries
People have died on House
YOu're wrong
haha
The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
ah, two prideful people arguing. it'll never end
lol
God.
7I was kicked on Bronystate
that CAJ said! :P
You can't have a discussion when bronies are around.
They just whine at you about love and tolerance.
:P
/me is with CAJ
/me is also with CAJ
There is nothing wrong with a discussion.
4I'm just saying that you cannot cover yourself when "Nobody ever dies in House" is meant to be an exaggeration when you presented it as a fact
4You gave absolutely no indication otherwise that it was an exaggeration
4Therefore
4It's your fault
Lol, no.
I'm not preaching love and tolerance, I just think this discussion is incredibly silly.
at least you weren't banned!
To me it is obvious what I meant.
4Lol yes
y
4And to me you stated it as a fact
didn't Ghosties have an argument about hating a certain movie like this a while ago too?
somepony was banned?
you can just rejoin immediatley
also, back :P
It is not my fault that you did not see it the way I intended.
...immediately*
4You never indicated it as an exaggeration
I try to preach love and tolerance, at least around here.
you're nothing but a silly billy
7I'm too lazy to rejoin
You can't tell my it's entirely my fault when I can't ensure you'll see what I say the way I intend it.
4You just cannot go "LOL you didn't get it" when your words had no implication that you were saying otherwise
I'm going to bed all, can I join this bunker next time I log in?
I think there was ample implication.
7Yes, it's always open
4Where?
4Point it out
That's the way I interpret it.
4Point it out
7have a good sleep
4Show me where you had an implication that you were exaggerating
>"People never die on House"
>I know that people die on House
13Welcome, honored guest
>Everyone does, I would also assume
hai
>Therefore people would assume that I'm exaggerating in my eyes
pretty please
15I am here M'lady.
4That's what you said, you never made it sound like you were exaggerating
[22:03] No one ever dies.
[22:03] In House.
[22:03] :P
13Where to begin.
;___;
4I admit this is completely stupid, arguing over words on the net, but you cannot tell me that you're not wrong in the least
15We have a guest?
:(
The ":P" also indicates a joking or exaggerating manner.
13CAJ, give us your "Opinion" on Valthejean
13CAJ is Herospirit
4Your obtuseness is coming through again, dari :)
[22:16] The onus may not be entirely on you, but nor is it on me.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/square/000/006/137/130856000524.gif?1308599498
4And you always :P
15Yes, I know, M'lady.
4It lost it's meaning
Who here whatches wrestling?
who's gonna be the man?
You say I am obtuse, and you aren't?
4Read what I said above
I acknowledged that I was as to blame as you were, yet you still said.
4This is completely irrational
>yet
[22:17] <Ghosties> Therefore
[22:17] <Ghosties> It's your fault
dear lord this is the worst argument ever.
4You never once said that you could have put it better
lol
7Alright, I'm going to rejoin. brb
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=kqKpR9YnNcE#t=27s
dari, leeeeave it. whoever leaves it got over it faster and is there for the most logical, grown up man. c'mon dudes
Seriously, stop doing that Daz.
wait wait what
13@Trustmeter CAJ
6 CAJ is 31% Trust. (1622)
I can have a discussion with Ghosties if I want.
There is nothing wrong with it.
13Hmm..
;__; but tehre's arguing in my bronystate
who is Herospirit and who is Valthejean
13-.-
Scootaloo vs Apple Bloom, GO!
It's not arguing.
4And, Daz?
yes, Ghosties ?
We aren't throwing insults at each other.
We're just having a discussion. :/
15I am herospirit.
oh ok
now who's this other person
4I don't want to see this turn in to Ponychan where we can't have a meaningful discussion....even if I think arguing over words on the internet is pretty low >.>
13I-.. No comment >.>
Dari, what are you "discussing"?
15Val is a powerful Arch Demon.

he-hey! both turned to comment something at me, and it's quietened down! :3
15Are we requesting the help of CAJ?
13I knew it
I already explained expansively.
4All I know is that people on Brony State can have a legitimate argument as long as it does not turn into mudslinging
13Im not sure, he doesnt even know who Val is
If you didn't bother to read it once I'm not going through the effort of reposting it for you to ignore it again.
13Just go back to watching Ponies I guess
13>.<
4Besides, I enjoy arguing with dari
How could he POSSIBLY misinterpret it?
:P who doesn't xD
you were WRONG
E_N: I refer you to the previously written statement
The statement which has been repeated several times, just for you.
:)
15We cannot merely leave our guest without proper information.
:I
7ohai WIlson
13Hmm
If olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from?
4Dari thinks he can put a ":P" and make it "exaggerated"
10yes we can
4Because that covers it, right?
As I said, it was obvious to me that it was exaggeration.
4It wasn't to me
Well what can I do about that?
4Communicate better
15Can not, my good sir.
Maybe I can try to make it more obvious ok, but that doesn't assure me you'll understand my intention.
Nothing ever will.
Also, what does communicate better mean?
4Sure you can
hi everypony!
How do you comminucate better?
Everyone interprets things differently.
There is no universal way I can make EVERYONE understand what I mean.
You could have capitalized the word ever
Yes there is
Then it's pretty clear you're exaggerating
A monocle
E_N: Different people would interpret that capitalisation in different ways.
see, you just did it
@pony The pony that got his/her cutie mark through arguing
6 The pony that got his/her cutie mark through arguing is 6Spik3e
If you wear a monocle EVERYONE will treat you seriously.
Nothing assures that people will see that as exaggeration.
wait... who was CAJ?
RobotPinkie: s02ep03 xD
More importantly, who was phone?
13Phone?
[22:27] There is no universal way I can make EVERYONE understand what I mean. <--- That clearly isn't exaggeration in my opinion
13...
It's emphasis.
Phone? I hate that guy.
13Who was in here E_N
There's a difference.
4Here's the situation: Dari said "Nobody ever dies in House," when people have died on House.
Though you may interpret it as exaggeration.
Which is my point.
'tis a joke Pinkie
What do you mean, Daz?
13>.<
13I see
RobotPinkie: as in a future episode xD joking ofc
O O OAOA
O O OAOA AA
lolol oh okay
RobotPinkie: she's drying :3
/me is away
15I opened the door...
15It was Fone
Yeah he doesn't have his cutie mark yet, maybe he'll join the CMC!
JOIN, THEE HYDROGENBONDS, JOIN!!!!!!
haha!
nevah
CMC spike best spike?
4The worst part about this entire argument is that it's completely retarded. We're both not gonna change opinion obviously, so we may as well just drop it.
Oh god that dance
hmm, how strange. normally when I open the door, everybody gets on the floor and starts walking
need more dance
THE DY-NOU-SAUR
Meh, there's not much I won't argue.
Ghosties: my point exactly, like I said earlier
hey guys
4I blame it on dari being British *smug grin*
It might be a pointless arguement Daz, but what arguements aren't pointless?
Ghosties said it first, he is manlier in my eyes for the next 24 hours :P
It's just a bit of fun.
15Boom boom shackalackalacka boom

4HE DIDN'T SAY THE SAFETY WORD
WOAHHHHHHHH
dont RP with socks kids or this might happen
7lol Ghosties
Which is "Bananas"
So, what software do you guys use to stream these?
i guess that's a good 'rape foreplay' as far as those go, but there are other kinds of foreplays
@Ghosties the safe word was gagging. Obviously.
it's called a "safe word", Ghosties :P
MY PASSS, WOAHHHHHHHH

4O.O WHAT A TWEEST
too little information Ghosties.
/me enjoys most peoples' fantasies
lololol
4lol it's from final fantasy
in before the 196.97. and that right there is a hugeass clue, if you can work it out, as to what is killing him
/me finds new fantasies every week
/me 4cannot juggle :(
4anyway though i don't remember it too well but i think it was pretty epic
youtube out of nowere
/me can juggle
youtube?
cant juggle either:(
Daz: ICD-9 code?
can juggle with ease
7Beep beep
well that makes sense, MeteorVenture, it came up after all
15Why can't I chat in the stream. :0
4MAGGOTS, MAGGOTS EVERYWHERE
Nittany_Tiger, sadly if you google it somewhere on the first page helps with the clue. don't do it, keep guessing :P
ibf chestburster
MY BLOOD IS FULL OF MAGGOTS *hit*

YES
stream?
the stream is on the right, Mibbit on the left is something else
do you mean the main channel, bronystate?
4LUPUS
15PINKIE. STREAM LINK
4THERE IT IS
I always say that, learned it from this
I'm not watching stream, but your clue trips me off as you're suggesting someone has a condition defined by the ICD-9 code 196.97
.
15http://www.synchtube.com/r/JWLS
15bloop
15OH NO IT HAS DIED.
15Someone save our pony stream!
I'd watch stream, but I'm in the office :<
Nittany_Tiger, implying 196.97 is only an ICD-9 code. tip, it isn't ^_^ it's something else
lolol I love Cameron
who doesn't? xD
Chase is such a woo-head.
word asssociatio: THE ULTIMATE diagnostic test
Most drs are jerks. true story.
I liek thirteen
Cutthroat bitch?
no, Cutthroat bitch is awesome. thirteen sucks.
what about Masters too? and the P.I. is probably my 2nd fave char after House imo.
o/
The P.I. was a fkin genius
GGgala, can't argue with that neither.
Kumar and the Mormon single dad were also awesome. why did all three awesome candidates disappear?
13Died?
13Its working fine for me
http://dr-house.series-tv.com/dr-house/images/actors/Michael_Weston.jpg http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/house-spinoff.jpg http://blog.tvguide.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/house.jpg This guy
HAHA
Actually I liked that one doctor candidate who thought just like house.
15It was just me it seems.
WhatPayne, remember the ep where House goes to a presentation by one of the people who went to his medschool with him? he dresses up and does that huge fake laugh. it's so good.
7so many spoilers suddenly
Not from me, Luna!
I think I do...
15This is business place. Stream is too open. :0
Don't ban me along with everyone else plz :(
spoilers? nuh rly, just saying this one time where House laughs in an awesome way :3
implyin she did, RobotPinkie
Don't worry, there has hardly been any spoilers here.
implyin' she will, Daz, though jokingly
13Herospirit
Rofl
lawl, instantly says "find out where House is" xD
15Yahs
yea i won't ruin anything huge, or infact anything of importance, but i like to discuss little things like House's fake laugh :P
HYPERSENSITIVITAH
i todja about the socks, dog, i toldja
GGgala told us bros bout them socks
the socks KEEP HAPPENING
dem socks
O U always thinking it's to do with the brain :P
It's Lupus
Dashie
XD
Someone needs to tell Luna about the possible complications from wearing socks...
It's not lupus
IT IS LUPUS! FUCK YOU!
15:0
My computer started freezing and everything when I saw you online
hahaha
>.<
I mean Princess Luna, not Sathi Luna :P
its never lupus
RDash?
9:D Sorry, I was watching the steam
Oh
she's worried is she?
:P
LUPUS! SEE?!
who's worried?
Now
We need Silvermane and Denied
And Reticent
And.. Polarfire
/me sighs
9Sorry, i made your computer derp :P
ooh, we watching House
nice
Isn't it like running joke where in every diagnosis someone suggests Lupus?
RobotPinkie, have you seen this episode before? and i meant the wife is worried, cuz of the shot with her with her hand covering her mouth
Well, I wanted to invite you and say "Dashie" so badly.
XD
I'm leaving for a while. Be back in about 2 1/2 hours
pretty much WhatPayne xD
Ok E_N
9Cya E_N
7could be.....
Bye
I dunno if I've seen this before, it seems familiar but I have no idea what's going to happen.
hyperactive =D. he's got Pinkie Pius
Do whatever you want w/o me. Just fill me in when I get back
Okay
You really only need Silver and Reticent
15Cya E_N
RobotPinkie: clue was 196.97, or 197 if ya want :P
Hopefully we will have our artists here soon
I have no idea what that means...
it's a clue :3
/me tries to interpret 196.97 as leetspeak, fails
back, sorry, mum called. anyways, what
is
up
???
NO LETTUCE?! WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
I'll just watch and see :P
4btw i really recommend final fantasy's 7 and 8
Rofl
I'd punch House for stealing my pancakes... that's so mean...
YES I FOUND the laugh WhatPayne
Idea!
Oh he just figured it out
Idea!
!
I believe that number is disease classification code, or something
House thinks she's poisoning him, or not heavy metals. clue: 197 >_<
We should give eachother make overs!
Daz where you found that laugh?
ITS NOT LUPUS

I think it's ringworms
"don't let her go to the bathroom!" :P

4Yes, both House and Wilson are based off Holmes and Watson
hve?
RobotPinkie, close, yes it's to do with the ring but ... well want clues?
He had that face of "oh I know what's goin' on", so it's definitely ringworms
ikr Ghosties

i suck at typing
ew worms
Nah I'm just kidding Daz, but I figure it's related to the ring somehow
heavy metal poisoning, maybe?
She's Lady?

Lo all
cue porn music
RDash: mfw there's this thing called CTRL F
ohay Sumica
I had to learn it from scratch myself. It entailed luck, looking things online, and outside help along with intuition to get to the level I'm at, which is probably surface-scratching.
4I have no idea why I capped all that
4I just felt like doing it *shrugs*
i was gunna say
colour AND caps? :P
Can you die from too much LOVE?
attention seeker :p

4Ah
4###
IRCfail

Let's see if # works as the letter h. #i w#at's up?
and channel #ITSNOTLUPUS means channel ITSNOTLUPUS

It's really not fair you keep showing this.. It's 2:20 AM here.. I really have to get to bed.. But thanks for an awesome show! Goodnight.
not the sparkly kind
7ahahahaha
I need to go to bed too, but I want to see Xena
absinthe wow

Silvermane: That stuff will mess you up.

lol
I prefer Irish Coffees if I'm going to do those, and I only get them with decaf
MFW memory is RAM
No.

All RAM is memory, but not all memory is RAM

All squares are rhombi, but not all rhombi are squares.

DERP
HAHA
2,14 good fucking god...facebook is deleting pony profiles....AGAIN....
mfw she's just like them
really? wow facebook
really facebook?
...
that's what, the 3rd time?
I want to hit her face with a brick
2,14 I've stopped counting
/me raises his hoof for first opportunity
Dat stare
Sounded like NMM
dat laugh
creepy dude
doesn't facebook just generally have a rule against RP accounts?
maybe if people understood that facebook profiles are used for real life profiles it wouldn't happen. I'm saddened by these deletions but they've had it coming.
but,but... pony
2,14 well, it technically does, but it seems to only crackdown on the pony accounts (well, one time they didn't)
Such a sensitive guy
Think of someone putting a fake identity in the phone book.
technically, but the counter to that is that people get to make them for their pets, so
14Ooooooooh...
14I see now
yeah
Dermathil, would anyone notice?
Ghosties: Sin Cara vs. Daniel Bryan
...
2,14 the problem for me lies in with people like Hipster who don't want to use their real account on brony related stuff
I think she's kinda cute, if she put her hair forward and stopped talking
make her shut up...
this lady
Silvermane, probably not, because there aren't any *Pictures* in phone books?
AHAHA
14I see why the Dykas incident is such a hot topic now.
lol
that isnt creepy at all
2,14 it's just very lame that some people can't even communicate with us anymore because of that
dykas incident?
I have a solution. Don't use facebook.
...
so much facedesk
2,14 well, that's the solution pretty much everyone is doing
Apolkalipse, if i didn't use facebook, i would NEVER hear from half my friends
Val: Why not have them use FlankBook for that?
tar-tar sauce
flankbook isn't as strong yet
14I dont have a Facebook myself. lol I have a Flankbook I dont use. XD
it feels more like myspace so far
Really? Well there are things like... a phone. real life. email?
2,14 because flankbook is kind of retarded
the laugh the laugh THE LAUGH!
>mfw I google Dykas and I get a result that says that Dykas actually lied about his father dieing in the Oslo massacre.
14^
(Suddenly I just lost a LOT of respect for this guy.)
2,14 ung....not the dykas thing again....
lolwut
Apokalipse, I forget half the people i know if i don't actively have a reason to remember them at the time. facebook keeps them available so taht i can message them quickly
14Yeah, we probably shouldnt take about it here... its a real hot topic and causes a lot of drama
14*talk
/me opens a temporary channel to talk about it without being in BState
not drama, discussion. I hate facebook, but i need it
(and what is Dykas?)
....
7....
Peter File?
oh man
XD
Silvermane, Dykas is the guy who changed his name to fluttershy Dykas
Kim Fluttershy Dykas
ah
ok silver. I can manage without facebook thankfully
lucky...
/me finally set up a blogger account (that he won't use) to comment on EqD
14I meant the Dkyas debate Silvermane We probably shouldnt since its a hot topic
I mean I have an account, but only check up on it once a month sometimes
oh okay Octavia. what is the argument about it?
i haven't kept up on a lot of things
Wait...somebody named themselves Fluttershy?
14Eh, read a few comments up. lol
14lol DE
14Only a few hundred in the community :P
the thing about him lying about his father's death?
/me chokes as he sees the cigarette

2,14 mfw saying I don't like durrgarrr is considered a flamewar
that's not what you said
looool

Valthejean well well well, some pony who remembers me.
that green is the colour of mould
i need some wings for my Fluttershy parody LARP char
(but but but... NightMareMoon... i noticed you first)
dat penis joke
7suddenly sound derp
7a sec
Silvermane THen you must know why im here.
(mfw i could kick their asses...)
Ummm.... jello shots?
lol silver you're funny
2,14 lol, what a perfect place to pause :P
grope
oh crap, i still need a tail and ears for that foxman char
7resuming
Lucifer... wow
> An angel
> Named Lucifer
this shit just hit crazy religion reference level
dat theme...
...needs more flute
>three, just stop with the banal shit. I dont mind fanfic, art or the good natured trixie files anything, but some of the posts are just ridiculous. Leaving gryphons out of the poll? what the fuck is this, man?
4I request Hercules
Well I just wasted my time taking someone's comments for actual serious complaints.
AllisZerofuu what?
Eh it's someone trolling EQD
7Ghosties noted for tomorrow
I actually thought he had valid points but he really is trolling.
Goes by the blogger name fagbutts
Lucifer was probably a cool guy in his early years
4Hercules is just an amazing show. I didn't realize that until a few years back when Sci Fi showed a marathon all day
i liked how they showed him growing in strength by having him pick up a horse every day from it's foalhood to adulthood
Anyway back on-topic. Should I go ahead and plan the interviews?
4Also, another great action series was Mortal Kombat Conquest
4But, I'm sure I'm the only one that believes that here >.>
What is this show that which you foals watch as we speak?
wait... she's going to cause the fall of Lucifer?
Ghosties: Divas of Doom in a tag match.
Sure. Do you have my availability on hand?
2,14 I find it *really* hard to believe Mortal Kombat was a good tv show...but since I haven't seen it I'll give it a chance :P
It is Xena, oh dark mare of the night
4FUCK
Mortal Kombat... in non game form? That can't possible be good, can it?
Versus Kelly and Alicia
Suddenly... fans of Nightmare moon?!
4@Apok: It's more common than you think
I'm not a fan. i'm just not suicidal
4And besides, the first film was great too
Yes, I do but your availability is a bit late for me. I planned the interviews last round starting at 1:30 and the last interview starting at 3:30
i mean, i have respect for her...
MK: Defenders of Earth was pretty bad, but it was the enjoyable type of bad.
Shall I just go ahead and post them on the forums?
Well, My availability may actually be changing soon
Oh, do tell
oh, the enjoyable type of bad
that sounds more possible
But for now, yeah, I'll make the last interview for sure and perhaps some of the one before it
4Bleh, a divas match?
Great.
4BRB bathroom break
I'll get on it now
Kelly and Alicia are decent.
Cool
And Beth and Natty can definitely get a good match out of those two.
Ghosties I hope you drown!
4Kelly's like the female Cena
4Wut are you talking about, NightmareMoon?
Did you vote on: http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6813944/1/#new?
(inb4 i get shipped to NMM... scared now)
another cannibal?
4And yeah, Beth and Natty are the best in the diva division at the moment. I just can't wait till Kharma comes back, then the division really will be great again
Going over them now
Silvermane Your kidding, your kidding right?
That OMG DVD will have the best table power bomb ever.
2,14 hah, ic wut u did thar nightmare
I am sorry NightmareMoon, but it just seems to happen.
inb4 naked Xena
drat
Secret butt fun
^
It's coming
oh, they cut...
damn
7^
2,14 inb4 the massage like...paralyzes him or something
wait, Virgil the poet? as in... THE Virgil?
Yeah, I noticed that too
Virgil and Lucifer? and Mephisto? dear lord
i want nothing, counter with everything. well why the fuck not
makes perfect sense to me
4I was a little interested in the OMG DVD, but I'm not gonna get it. If it's just skits and segments, then I'm not gonna buy it.
wow
suddenly orgy
lol
What the hell?
Hey Silvermane
Reticent not gonna come today?
wow
I went AFK for just a few minutes, get back and... What is going on?
this show is so strange
14he gets on late sometimes
14he started school and has a life now
14what a loser... :(
Xena. That is all explanation you need
O.o
I see.
i like those 2 things
Lol
I like this party
2,14 better to live free in hell than serve in heaven ey Xena?
Xena seems pretty selfish and, frankly, evil this episode
Well there's a hole with evil green jello
it corrupted her heart. Or something
7goo!
well hello fan service
2,14 >implying this entire episode hasn't been fanservice :P
Ghosties: It's sick bumps, too.
^
Like Mae Young going through the table.
(The one where she slapped Bubba Ray across the face and told him to stop being a bitch and put her through it)
I don't even know what im watching anymore....
lol
Interesting pause
haha
2,14 lol sathi, you troll :P
NightmareMoon stopped stream to talk to us! MFW
7what happend :o
/me loves Luna but is now really scared
so they're german now?
^
Michael?
7suddenly
Gabrielle?
7party stoppers
someone stopped the stream to talk to us?
2,14 it's kinda sad that they're trying to make us sympathize with Lucifer...considering I want the angels to win right now :P
yes, the NightMareMoon
oh no, it knocked her back
2,14 also yeah luna, the stream paused with a NMM soundboard :P
/me liked the party before more
I think they want us to consider that Lucifer's fall isn't all his fault
yeah, the party before was nice
/me agrees on the party
JUDO CHOP
an angel holds the strength of God in his arms, so he should be able to simply break her arm by hitting her weapon
15OhGogWe'reSoLonely
nope, because Xena
2,14 it also depends on the mythology
Buck her up!
true, but Arch Angel Lucifer was BAMF
Pinkie, i said OP Silver not admin him
14lol
nothing on Michael, but still
he should really make up his mind already
No offense Silver
What a manipulative bitch

Alright, put my input
I don't see the reasoning behind her creating Satan.
wait, she's free of corruption because she made an arch angel fall?
Fatality?
no, because she closed the evil hole by making an arch angel fall

2,14 I don't get why they don't bring them back in the US....
i cant read the text
2,14 I had to buy mine off of Ebay for crying out loud....
because they know bronys are here and they are hateful, judgemental pricks
If they did, I'd totally go get one. like a boss (only found out about the show to begin with afterwards)
>yfw I ain't got toy
Wow
They light up when you press a button?
O_o
yeah
I knew of a collecters show, they sold all kinds of MC D's toys all the time there. They did't know what they had so i got em cheep.
2,14 unfortunately there are no mc'donalds up in stupid retarded provo...at least, anywhere near campus

>yfw the flood in the Core didn't freeze the entire planet
I doubt there's enough water in the Thames to cool the core.
:P
isn't the Thames linked to the ocean?
2,14 lol yeah, if anything it just became the largest spider soup ever :P
Well, yeah.
damn I wish I could do that
you got your answer dari.
Well the whole ocean wouldn't drain.
:P
MOLESTIA Y U AFK?!?!?!?!?
Would take a while but it would lower 'til the Thames was empty
so it would lower the sea level below the Thames's level
13Denied

Ahaha, nah it's good that you're filling in for me. :>
2,14 how is it that people in the dr.who/torchwood universe haven't gone crazy? I mean it seems like they deal with monster attacks all the fucking time
Farewell foals I got a world to take over AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! *disappears*
Valthejean, they have discovered that aliens exists.
BAI FRIEND!
/me glomps NightmareMoon. "I LOVES YOU SEXY BUTT!"

Bai friend NightmareMoon!

Don't use the Whoception.
Bye NMM
oh ok
*TARDISception
2,14 I'm guessing they actually got the original actor for this ep? or is it just someone who looks like him?
ah :P
it comes in a Smith episode.
*reappears and french kisses silvermane then disappears*
WTF?
i dont get vodka?
PrincessMolestia something about birds and bears... i was hugging you and then you *mmmfff* Oh my, I love you too NightmareMoon <3
hahahaah
and then i stole your liver silver
and molestia's wallet and her roofies
and i decided to not run cause im too drunk
this is awesome
13Oh yeah.
INB4 Pinkie Pie Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
since I think that is the actual 5th doctor actor
btw your out of roofies PrincessMolestia
/me 13takes Silvermane into another room where many horrible sounds are heard from outside
also can i have my sword back?
Lawl
13Must get moar!
listen if i get my sword back i PROMISE i wont kill or dismember anyone
13Silly Decap, swords dont go there.
/me wonders what the cloth shackles on the wall are for, and why his wings are so tickley.
but i will harvest them for their organs
>mfw JOHN SMITH
wow......
btw PrincessMolestia i need to give your liver to Silvermane so i can go and sell his liver on the black market
2,14 so then why doesn't tennant remember THIS happening to him if this was a previous doctor?
Tennant remembers
but this doctor doesn't
Blink!
2,14 hahaha...
you dont need your liver do you PrincessMolestia?
This is Tennant's 2nd time in this video
G'night
/me 13's live is no good from too many room parties with "Special" guests
The older doctor will then remember this event when he becomes Tennant
13*liver
2,14 but what I'm saying is, tennant should remember being the 5th doctor here in this particular event. So why would he ask him about blink if that hasn't happened to 5th doctor?
OHSHIT
fuck it
BOTH DOCTORS
ill just give Silver's back to him
AND BOTH CYBERMEN MODELS
/me wonders why he can't bring his wings down and why PrincessMolestia left him in cloth shackles on the wall. "What do birds have to do with this? Is it because I'm a pegasus? I don't get it."
i'm too drunk for this
/me goes into the room with a knife and a cooler, screams of agony are heard,
/me 13thinks Silvermane makes a cute wall decoration
/me comes back out covered in blood
13:D
well all done
now can i learn about the birds and the bees?
PrincessMolestia ;) You know my kink too well
also i stole all of your stuff
13My bondage gear!
13And he took my favorite whip too
nah, i left that, but i stole that dude that was chaine to your wall
2,14 O_o
13And... oh dear, I wont even mention that...
Molestia: Your little wingboner kit (by Cereal_Velocity)
At least he left the silk. It really makes the long-lived bindings more comfortable
13Oh, him. He had the best lesson of his life, so he was all set.
his organs should sell for a good price
lol companion
(DecapPony, a Timelord has 2 hearts)
/me is glad he didn't mention his whip in his closet...
anyway what were you going to tell me about the birds and the bees?
night Razyn
but first
/me passes out
Did I miss anything?
/me 13teaches Decap about "physical education"
NOPONY TOLD ME THEY SHOWED DOCTOR WHO HERE! WAHHHHHH!
/me wakes up
Well now you know!
huh chained to a wall
Well, TwilightSparkle, your mentor has me tied up in her private chambers and her bondage gear was stolen. Besides that, not much
We also show House in the afternoons.
welcome Kencolt
hahahaha
ive been through worse
We show all sorts of stuff here.
unless the pony mafia is here
13I'm sure you have ;)
Dari is british
^ That's a lie
wait the pony mafia arent here are they?
His accent is totally fake
13He wears a top hat and monocle and sips tea all the time, true story.
cause then im glad i had that shotgun put in my bionic hoof
im just glad that i was able to get one, makes up for not knowing magic, or having wings
DELETE DELETE DELETE
wait, am i covered in wax?
Princess you mind letting go of silvermane?
Somehow, this does not seem the best possible defense technique...
i already got him off of the wall TwilighSparkle
but now Silver and i are both up here
and im completely sober :'(
so wazzup
2,14 hello suffuri
PrincessMolestia, can you let me go? my fillyfriend is upset that I'm faking-banging deities on the side... unless you want to bring MirthTinker up here..."
It's my old nemesis, Val!
2,14 wait...what?
>mfw I checked the Doctor Who wiki and this episode is the 2008 special
and can you get me some vodka?
the gray background is nice.
2,14 thanks :P
there is some wierd taste stuck in my mouth
my music turned on
so i looked at my fan thinking it got stuck
CUTIE MARK CRUSADER CHATTING YAY!
WHY, WHy, WHY is there always some Earthperson who just does NOT get the idea that co-operating with the alien invaders who want to kill/mutate/recostruct everyone else is a bad idea?
>mfw the episode's plot is entirely different from what I thought it was
Kencolt: they want to save their asses
CutieMarkCrusaders? Wasn't someone shipping me with them after a time-travel incident?
No.. they always seem to think they will profit. If there is anyone I can't love and tolerate, it's the moroonic collaborators in a Dr. WHo episode.
Yes, yes they were.
Silvermane is it me or do you smell burnt flesh?
No. I don't know. Never!
2,14 well kencolt, they don't have the luxury of being an audience member :P they don't see all the hundreds of times that fails :P
I smell... food
/me looks at side and sees a bloody bandage
I wish I did.
XD
aww shit
Old timey TARDIS
I personally would think that it was obvious...
lawl
and he figured it out
HAHAHAHAHA! TARDIS!
/me looks over at SilverMane's side
SilverMane you have a brand on you
So, can anypony give me a quick rundown on what happened before?
ummmmmmmmmmm
IN THE EPISODE.
I have a brand. Huh. Well, at least now there is always an explanation for why i'm a bitch
you know what though, these cuffs are fairly comfortable
Yeah, genuine silk is like that. Probably spider silk, judging by the give
anyways, you want to get out of here?
Eh, I'm good. She lost her whip, so she has to work manually now.
i always have my straight razor with me, i could probably get us out of here
are you sure?
what about your filliefriend?
2,14 haha...he had the entire doctor who series downloaded into his brain :P
THE ONE AND THE ONLY
13Hmm, Want You Gone isnt bad. Sounds a lot like another Portal-esque song I know of...
it is a portal song
Half a doctor? Hey-- there's hope, we have one and a half Doctors here!
Molestia why is there a bandage on my and why is there this strange taste in my mouth?
* me
DecapPony, I'm sure Tinkerbelle will come find me soon enough. MirthTinker is a smart filly
say what?
13Its based off the Portal song, but its not the Portal song itself. :P
also what happened to the straight razor i kept in my mouth?
2,14 lol...I still haven't played Portal 2
GO PLAY IT
AND MAKE YOUR ELITISM EVAPORATE
oh...yeah, I planted a tracking chip on your rump while you were doped up on cola once, Mr.Peddington knows where you are at all times SilverMane
13That signifies a happy night Decap :P
2,14 don't have it
hrmm
... MirthTinker, is that why you gave up on span- umm started playing nice?
Happy night Happy happy happy HAPPY!
are you sure?
my keyboard is off.
this combinatorics is decent,.
lawl Val.
cause my junk really hurts
I thought you meant you had Portal 2 yet hadn't played it
2,14 ah, sorry for that then
Valthejean, is Metro 2033 a game you like?
Span...-ish? I've never been to Europe
Steampunk cybermen? What next?
or mexico i guess
2,14 never even heard of it derma
ah
hai MirthTinker
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033
look it up, Val.
oh you MirthTinker. so silly
and of shit They will NOT Cybermanize the kiddos.
]They would cyberize pulppies if it would serve-- wait, I think they did.
MirthTinker can you get SilverMane and I down from here before PrincessMolestia comes back?
DRAWFRIEND TIME
drawfienddddd
yay
it was a big meh
nope...I'm going to bed, you'll live till morning right? :P
i might, but idk about SilverMane
13Molestia is a bit busy, so shes kinda here and kinda not. :P
13Especially now with Drawfriend. lol
2,14 have a good night mirthtinker
although i did steal most of PrincessMolestia's stuff so....
I Trixie have arrived.
I LIKE that girl.
*PAWNCH*
She got pwnied.
2,14 hello thegreatandpowerfultrixie
trixie dont go to any parties PrincessMolestia invites you to
Hello Val.
you will wake up chained to a wall
The Great and Powerful Trixie? Come aid the Mighty and Magnificent Silvermane! And perhaps you can enjoy the bindings i find myself in, yourself ;)
Hey Trixie. Your name is way too long.
why isn't /nick working
aw fuck it
why isn't slash nick working
Nick changes are disabled.

oh whoops didn't mean to double post
You'll have to log out and log back in to change your name.
dodododdododooooo
Silvermane hmmm maybe.
can you help me Great and Powerful Trixie?
Oh, how deeply I hate this lady now...
I'll make it worth your while
Designated a lie... HAH!
i can too, and ill give you some of the stuff i stole from Molestia!
You know, this actually can only be an improvement.
dat oversized steam engine
Silvermane asked first so I assist HIM first.
;
;)
Hammerfight
Okay... I was wrong. She's WORSE...
destroying my Colussus then not giving me my cash to buy another :/
nah
2,14 suddenly wants to be the cyberking
last night
/me realizes that no one is creating Twixie shipping. How else will Baby Midnight get born?
am I the only one who keeps thinking they are saying Saibamen
maybe, Kencolt. But only because the cybermen had numbers.
level 10 of dungeons of dredmor, I got impatient and accidently walked into my 3x3 of infinite deadthings
2,14 lol Caj, well NOW I am :P
Yes. yes, you are.
Hey guise
and promptly died on the last level with permadeath on.
TwilightSparkle can you help me down from these chains that your master put me into?
TwilightSparkle and TheGreatandPowerfulTrixie, this can only end well.
also ValtheJean someone like... pulled me into a seperate chat today and was asking what I thought about you
>mfw THE SON
CAJ, you so silly
It kind of evens out.
but I r teh SRS
Dat Captain Jack
2,14 well whatever the case, I think it's best we not discuss such things ;)
DecapPony oh sure *uses magic on the chains and shatter them*
exactly Kencolt. But Only because the Cybermen have numbers.
I just told them I didn't know who you were, but now I know. So yay.
That and Cyberweaponry is on a par. And until recently, they had a major advantage.
thanks
Anyway, you seem nice enough, so eeeyup.
/me gives TwilightSparkle a BDSM whip
2,14 :P
i stole this from your teacher's closet
3dari why you gotta hate?
lol that autoscript
hey Silvermane you want to get out of here?
DAT CYBERLOMG
0hater
Well I gotta go bed time -_-
Same here
DecapPony, depends. Is Trixie or molestia planning anything? if not, i guess i need down
im doubting that they are
TAKE THE TARDIS (balloon form)
0hrmm
/me pulls out a combat knife and cuts down Silvermane
0Drawfiend was fantastic tonight
0how do you do emotes?
Thanks. *sigh* I never get to do this
Oh, even better- STEAMPUNK MECHA!
Emotes are /me

0the Aku one from Samurai Jack was nice.

Delete seems to work too...
Epic shields. :P

2,14 except that replicators eat through shields like butter :P
0stargate/dr who crossover?
sorry, i'm in bed with my mare. can't really do much, what with her in my back and all

And here it comes...

well im off to steal more stuff
One HELL of a flintlock.
2,14 the Asgard would still kick all ass :P
Not Time Lords. :P
Well, maybe Time Lords.
/me vanishes into thin air infront of the bed
But not the Doctor.
2,14 lol
Doctor > All
:P
2,14 Thor > All
2,14 it seems we are at an impass :P
:P
(The doctor Did trap an entire planet in between the folds of spacetime)
peh, thor
I can only think of one person in all fiction who COULD beat the doctor...
Val, I watched Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis.
Kencolt706: batman?
Lolz.
I can say with confidence that the Doctor is the better.
If you mention Atlantis people will rage most likely.
squirrel girl?
(I know dari. That's the goal)
is val here?
Jayne_Cobb: YES
No. Ranma Saotome. Who would listen to his usual speil-- and then just punch in inna face anyhow.
XD
2,14 Thor managed to outsmart the demi-god anubis with ancient technology, your argument is invalid
/me reappears in the room
im soo sorry..

My humble opinion anyway.

lyra, zomg wtf was taht? silly
The Doctor destroyed the entirety of the two most powerful species in existence (and out of it).
Your arguement is invalid
/me gives SilverMane his wallet back

2,14 whoopsie
I want a Droid but they're too expensive over here
Got this cause it's affordable
Also all data throttling in this country is terribad except for BBs, cause everyone has one here
Val: it has no Ctrl Key though. I'm guessing you meant Ctrl + K?
2,14 for the first part, yes. But if you have any way of copying a message and pasting it I think we can get it to work
yeah I have ways to do so....just not in-client
I can paste stuff into my text input but I can't copy text from the channel, pour example
2,14 not in client then? Damn...
wait lemme try something
@11
@11 I am Gendum
Bleh
2,14 :- /
Gonna keep trying
./)*3*(\
Alright, I think I'm out for tonight, planning on showing up tomorrow
Night, everypony :3
2,14 Have a good night Thunderdash
later mate
2,14Have any luck yet DCD?
nope
woops, guess i idled too long
2,14 happens :P
Forgot I was in here after the sound cut out.
2,14Haha, when the stream dies so does chat apparently :P
Shame that, but seeing as the odd hours the mods keep here it's bound to happen.
2,14 oh well
So you gonna be a streamer too now Val?
2,14I can't promise anything, as it hasn't been discussed at all. For now at least, it's looking like "no".
2,14With that being said, anything can change
No worries, was just wondering as they seem to still be looking for S2 streamers/mods.
2,14Fair enough
Sumica, we are
both positions are not mutually inclusive, though
you can be a streamer but maybe you don't pass the mod interview, or a mod cause your hardware can't handle streaming. And so on.
were you wishing to apply for a streamer position?
Not sure if i have the horsepower needed to stream, my down pipe is fine but my upload is low.
how low is your UL?
1-2 iirc
higher than mine
I have 0.99 Mbps
and I stream just fine
it's a matter of technique
in any case, check http://speedtest.net
what's your UL?
showing .7 on that, I think I need to call my isp and see if they are running network test again.
.7 is good enough
you need .614 for an HQ stream
do you have a capture card by any chance?
yeah.
you DO?
and The Hub?
Need to set it back up, migrated to a Procc and HD so did't set it all back up
heh yeah got the hub, went out and upgrade to digital cable just for that =p
still a capture card is a capture card
You just might be the candidate who can provide the best quality
What are your CPU/RAM Specs?
4gig ddr3 dont recall the speed on it. clock is a 4 core checking dx to get the specs.
...Yeah
it should run just fine
you're pretty much hired by now if you want to be a streamer
all that's left is testing the stream tomorrow and training you
I'll be available from 10 AM EST to 4 PM EST
will you be around then?
Sadly I have work tomorrow , I can set it up thur and test it friday if that works for yah.
damn
till what time do you work?
also, what do we know of the S2 schedule? Will it actually be running on Saturdays? Cause I'm guessing that's just a premiere sort of thing
2,14I have no idea, let me see if I can dig up some info
double shift, ass crack of dawn till around noon then come back at 4 till midnight.
saterday the 17th at 8am
is the first run of the show
then again at 6pm iirc
PST
2,14Oh nice (this is totally random) but they added Batman the Animated series to their Fall schedule
cause if you have to work during stream time...if you have no qualms with Remote Access, we can use TeamViewer and I could handle your streaming from my comp
holy shit Val that is rad
Sumica, so from Noon to 4, you won't be available?
Roger that
im back
2,14wb decappony
noon to 4 pm pst Iwill be off work but travle time and geting lunch I probaly will not be online.
ah, I see
hey Decap
hey
2,14hmmmm
I could probably do a test thursday evening assuming I get the capture card and such back up
will you be available anywhere around 10 AM and 4PM EST tomorrow?
2,14it may actually be a saturday new episode thing
http://www.nickandmore.com/2011/08/23/the-hubs-fall-schedule-first-look-batman-the-animated-series-goosebumps-join/
have to put the card in the case and reinstall software.
Sumica: we need to test FME in your PC first though. For that, we don't need the capture card just yet
2,14 at the bottom it has the lineup starting september 6th
ah oki
Val: feels badman ;___; Saturdays are terribad for me
Also is it 8 AM EST?
I belive the times on the site saif pst
2,14 that's a good question...I have no idea
2,14 also I feel your pain DCD :(
want me to just check the guide on my cable?
please do
confound these ponies
they drive me to waking up early on the only day I can sleep in
i already have my dvr set up to record the new episodes
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9etPQYpFgx0/Tls9178hE_I/AAAAAAAAB6E/47cnfBwXOEg/s400/meet_the_cluster_by_lifesequencebreak-d47zfio.png
2,14 it's looking like at the moment they don't have the specifics that far...I wonder if the ponychan thread about S2 might know more
feh, the schudule onle goes up 9-5
2,14 DecapPony: Fuggin saved
Val, please investigate for me
Decap: what about S2 streaming? When streaming, FME can record your video stream as well
13It costs me 400,000 bits to play my cello for 12 seconds...
yeah i need to go and get a capture card first
2,14Haha o u molestia :P
same with the one on Hubs site.
lol @ PrincessMolestia
You mean it costs other people 400,000 bits to hear you play your cello for 12 seconds...
getting easycap is the economic option
But we got to test well if you can stream, first
So let's test that tomorrow
2,14"FLUTTERSHY! ARE YOU SURE DIS WILL VERK?"....."I have NO IDEA!"
13lol Correct Dashite!
Hi Octivia
so considering how things look at the moment...we have Sumica as the possible mane streamer, GGgala passed the examination and is getting easyCap, and Decap is a promising candidate
it cost 1,000 bits per second to use my machete
If you want to test what ever it is you want to test with out capture gear we can try it now NewDCD
Sumica: I can't though LOL gotta sleep, got 5 hours to sleep left
13Hey Octivia? Am I suddenly a healthy dairy product?
wait
2,14Ouch DCD! Get some sleep ya foo!
HAI OCTAVIA!
Thought it was Activia
Who's Molestia again?
2,14That would be octavia :P
13Hey Decap
13Thats me DCD ;)
ow i just cut my hand open....'
well if Sathi or Dari or even Sprinks get online
eh it will be fine
13Darnit Val, you ruined the surprise. lol
2,14<.< >.>
13Well, with everyone shouting my name... lol
it's like cinamax, after 3am octavia turns in to PrincessMolestia.
13lol
2,14I don't know about sprinks, but sathi and dari will be out for a while
tell them to come and set up Sumica for an FME Stream Test
2,14Dari just went to bed...say...40 minutes ago?
2,14That we can do :P
in any case
Sumica, yours is an HD Capture Card, ja?
well its after 10pm....
so i turn into GenocidePony!
maybe we could go full retard and have an HD Quality, an SD HQ Stream and an SD LQ Stream
negitive, I was checking prices on them as we talking though
2,14That'd be pretty ballin
seems I can get an HD capture card from frys for around 40ish so I might just do that between shifts.
ah, but Sumica
I thought you already had a capture card?
I do, it's just not HD =p
I see. Well, don't purchase anything till we run the tests that determine whether your comp can handle FME, kay?
kay I really should go sleep now LOL
Night erryponi
2,14sleep well dcd
2,14dream of many fighting robots :P
2,14with ponies piloting them :P
13Night DCD
see yeah DCD
2,14You know, sometimes I wonder if Dari really sleeps, or if he actually just stalks the chat. That script is mighty unsettling at times :P
13I bet your computer will probably be able to handle FME fine though. If its got 4 gigs ddr3 ram and a quad core.
will do
2,14Yeah, though it's better to be safe than sorry
2,14After all, we wouldn't want anyone spending money only to find out *something* doesn't work
13Oh it will. lol
13Unless there some software bug that messes with FME
i can run FME and only have CPU usage at 20 to 30%
well I would still use the card. I watch shows on my psp on breaks
13I can run FME like a champ and I've only got a quad with ddr ram
13*ddr2 ram
2,14Well, what if trollestia planted his computer with anti-pony streaming viruses? :P
i bet no one knows who i am
well that or I jack bluetooth projectors in the conference rooms and play pony videos on them to troll the stuffed suit guys.
2,14Indeed, who could this mysterious Decapking be? :P
13lol Nope, not at all Decap :P
well im xxHeadremoverxx
13Playing ponies on all the bluetooth projectors would be pretty cool :D
2,14Plus you'd be giving your office the gift of ponies :P
is there any better gift?
it's kinda amusing just for the shock value.
2,14None that I can think of my friend :P
at least outside of PrincessMolestia's world
13;)
Seeing as the guys that set up the projectores know noting about secureing bluetooth connections.
/me 13gives the best gifts
2,14>mfw S2's pilot episode is just this orgasmic mayhem of everything we've been hoping for
right molestia, like a brand is a good gift?
although you did let me go and steal all of your stuff
/me 13gives the gift of "friendship". The best gift there is, right? :D
heres hopeing ValtheJean, I just fear every one is geting them selves too excited over it and noting can ever meet our wildist expatations.
2,14Only if there's ponie's invo.....wait....OH GOD NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
2,14Well, I'll be satisfied if they keep a consistent quality as season 1
indeed.
2,14everything else is just icing on the cake
2,14of course, if that bitch Trixie makes even ONE appearance I'll blow a gasket
from now on after 10pm i become DecapKing, cause Octavia can become a fucking princess.....
....I just realized something. We went from my just making conversation about you getting to stream or not to oh hey I might be streaming S2 =p
2,14 lol
/me 13has a feeling Trixie will indeed make another appearance
2,14Well honestly that's a good thing :P
/me agrees with the princess
They already said she would PrincessMolestia.
2,14I didn't even realize you were interested in streaming. I'm glad that DCD asked :P
13Did they finally confirm it?
2,14Sumica: Link or it didn't happen
SHOW US ZE LINK!
13I saw someone say vaguely, but it wasnt an actual confirmation.
2,14/me prepares his Impaling Trident to charge the Hasbro building
feh, hold on let me go dig back thru that interview.
2,14lame...apparently color doesn't work with /me
nope
Val you lier!
.avi
2,14at least, on mIRC
I thought you said you gave up the trident!
13lol
2,14And I also said that I sleep with it at night because it makes me feel safe :P
i thought Molestia said she gave up her special
You know they conform noting but hint at everything =p
'parties
13Well, I have a friend on the show, and I know some things others dont. :P
2,14O_o
2,14*Rarity Voice* TELL ME TELL ME TELL ME!
Molestia... did you know that you were my favourite mod?
2,14But seriously, if Trixie reappears in S2...dear god there will be no stopping my impaling spree
TELL ME OR YOU WILL BE WHIPPED!
And by were, I of course mean are.
13lol I cant Val. And anything I can a little, I hint at in my comments on EqD once in a while when its appropriate. :P
13lol Dashite :P
2,14I liked you better when you were Octavia, Octavia would tell me these things :P
/me 13likes to be whipped though
yeah but molestia is more fun
eqd news tag is useless.
13Octavia would just shy away like Fluttershy. :P
THEN YOU WILL NOT BE WHIPPED UNTIL YOU TELL ME!
2,14Molestia, I will track you down and find where you live!
2,14And then I'll make you tell me!
13lol Oh Val, you stalker, you. :P
2,14What can I say? I like watching people :P
I dunno if Octavia would shy away. Octavia is like franziska von karma. She's not taking any of your shit.
unfortunately for you she likes that kind of thing
13Ah, I think I know what you mean Sumica. Since I see all the EqD posts.
13It was a hint, vaguely, but not a confirmation really. :P
2,14On an unrelated note...English classes are the best
FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
2,14First assignment? Read Beowulf: Me gusta
math is better
2,14Of course...I've already read it...but hey I like it enough to reread it :P
13Bueno
2 minutes to do the assignments
2,14Phffff, math can suck it :P
THIS CALLS FOR A BATTLE!
13lol
DecapKing: Strategic Management was way better. One assignment all semester. Aww yeah.
2,14Lol, that would be quite the battle
FOR MY WEAPON, I CHOSE MOLESTIA!
2,14Sorry Decap. You can't. Unfortunately you can't speak to anyone without english :P
binary
sign language
russia
*russian
chinese
japanese
german
spanish
2,14>Implying you know all of those
2,14>and further implying that you get to bring other fields with you
2,14Also, binary is useless if you have no language to translate it
2,14mwahahaha! I win :P
13lol
if we didnt have math there wouldnt be any internet
*grumbles* oki I must have just had a moment of insanity cause I cant find the damn EqD post.
13Its okay Sumica, I think I know the one you mean anyway.
13I dont miss any EqD posts :P
I am sure i saw such a post it went to some comments over on tumbler or what ever the hell it is.
/me still hates the thought of a trixie reappearance
2,14But if she does reappear...I am litterally going to track Sethisto down and impale him personally
/me DEMANDS MORE BIG MAC!
/me 13thinks about a Trixie reappearance
but I cant seem to find it now and i went back as far as the 30million post stuff.
13imokaywiththis.jpg
Trixie X Twilight in season 2. :)
/me slaps Dashite
/me slaps ValtheJean around with a bit of a large trout!
13>yfw Molestia becomes canon
but that would be incest, they are sisters after all =p
2,14My slap came first, so I win :P
id be ok with molestia becoming canon
13I just love the face people gave Molestia. lol
AND MOAR BIG MACINTOSH!
13Eeyup
2,14Yeah, the Molestia face is priceless
She's not already? I thought all mods were canon.....wait that means Val can ship with Caramel now.
13lmao
>_>
/me is not sure whether to be angry or happy
Caramac!
*ducks*
/me reaches for his BanTrident
anyway how are things since ive been gone molestia?
/me 13locks Val and his trident in a cage for now :D
2,14Awwwwww....no fair :P
Hurray! Molestia love me!
No wait...
yes its a 'special'
cage
YOU DO NOT WANT THAT DASHITE!
13You know it ;)
/me 13loves everyone, extra special
2,14I demand that similar punishment be sent to the troller!
13Okay, okay...
dont you mean 'special'?
>_>
/me 13locks everyone is cages
/me 13grins
/me is a happy pony now

2,14The French Revolution says hi :P
You know I used to think i never missed any eqd post but now I wonder as i never saw this before.
ive seen it
i just never posted it up here
and i post pics up like a motherfucker
13Oh yeah, I remember that comic. Hilarious.
13I love how Twi and Fluttershy just keep eating like nothing happened at all.
13Ohmygosh, the muffin man!
13Derpy <3

DERPY SHALL BE FEATURED MOAR!
2,14I don't even know what to think about that comic....yet I find myself saving it

/me lulz at the chumps in cages
2,14Anyway, I think it's time for this pony to sleep
2,14Take care my fellow bronies, and I shall see you in the morning
Now I can random yay the speakers in the hallways.
im going to use this in the middle of class while my phone is in my pocket
why did molestia put you guys in cages again?
Because Val was lonely.
you guys are in cages while molestia is around, ive seen enough porn to know where this is going
13Lmao
13I like where this thread is going!
imokwiththis.jpg
Wait, when and how did I get in a cage?
molestia threw us in, and i got out
also new best pony is Aku pony.

It works better if you link the whole thing instead of just the first panel.
And with that it's time for sleep!
/me is now gone.
So correct me if I am wrong but this looks like Phantasy Star.

@molestermeter PrincessMolestia
6 PrincessMolestia is 59% molester. (1691)
well at least its getting closer
@molestermeter PrincessMolestia
6 PrincessMolestia is 64% molester. (1692)
close enough
13I keep going up!
13@molestermeter PrincessMolestia
6 PrincessMolestia is 50% molester. (1693)
13Aww, I went back down lol
better but still seems low, I would say at least 25% troll,80% Molester 15% some othere stuff.
well seeing as what you did to me and SilverMane that seems correct
Suppose I should go to sleep that whole asscrack of dawn shift and what not. Try not to ride them too raw PM.

Hey Daz.
Good thanks.
You?
Just woke up, got a great day lined up for myself today, so i'm good too
light up mcdonalds pony toys? haha
Wrek, any news on when part 5 of 'through the eyes of another pony' will be out?
yay~ roundup
ponycountdown dot com =D
Hey RobotPinkie
RobotPinkie just joined?
hey Daz
Sup
I had such a spectacularly crappy first half of the day
but then I found a toy store that sells blind bag ponies!
Wait
in Sweden :P
nope swed- aw ninja'd
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
...BLINDBAGS?!?!?!?!
I thought they were only in Germany?
wantwantwant
I got 3
:( Everywhere but UK
/me cries
no doubles, and one of them was mane 6 :3
/me lowers his head
I'm sorry :(
You know you can check the numbers to know which pony you're getting.
They didn't have them two weeks ago, though, I just checked because I was in the area
...you can?
Which numbers? :o
I don't even HAVE 4 technically. just those 2 sets, and the show's /now/ /under/ /way/ in Italy, but not here yet D:
RobotPinkie: OMGAGAD get no.3!
as you can see, no.3 is RD
aaaaaand yes, fffuuuu Fluttershy
AHA!
holy fuck I'm going back there tomorrow, then
"French Giggle at the Ghostly Apparently Pinkie Pie says "Tease the Zombies" and revenants/vampires in this one, which is actually really awesome. I hope there are revenants, zombies, and vampires coming up! Halloween Special anyone? You can find it here! "
Y U NO LINK MEEEEEEE
(the 'here' isn't linked) :(
lol
also RobotPinkie every box contains one of every pony
if you got the money, ask to go out back and buy an unopened box
wai Daz?
wai. well, according to something i read bfore
Oh...
So no doubles in any one box?
that's what it said...just finding it now
because then I'm definitely doing that...
haha
yea just looking for that post
lol I only have 5 molded ponies, so...
"If you want all 24, I have heard rumors that if you buy a box rather than individual bags, the box will contain all 24 ponies. It is a rumor though, so don't get upset if you buy a box and end up with duplicates. " there's more somewhere thou lemme keep looking
there is more somewhere, lemme keep googl'ing
lol I can't find it either
: /.
still looking thou, for myself too ; )
otherwise I'll just have to go look at the numbers until I catch 'em all :P
"In a blind bag box, this is true because there is one of each pony and they are equal. "
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/merch/res/34422.html
hmm
hey RobotPinkie be sure to see how many blindbags there ARE in a box. if there's 24 bags, and you look at the numbers, and see like '1 2 3 4' etc then BUY A BOX FOR THE LOVE OF CELESTIA
:P
that's how i've decided i'm gonna do it. look at the numbers on an opened box, and if so, ask to go out back for an unopened one. :P
It seems like 24 would be a reasonable assumption
considering the size of the box, and the size of the bags
that (there being 24 in a box, or space for 24 in a box if some have been taken), and if you look at the numbers on the packets and see they are in order, or at least no repeats, then yea buy a bawx
OMAI so uh
please answer
how much is it for a set of 2 ponies where you are? and how much is a blindbag?
(i need to know how much they'd be for Spain :P)
a blindbag is about €2
aaaand FS is a little dried and is looking pretty good.
set of two ponies, I haven't seen.
...TWO?!? YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
ah well. I haven't seen other ponies yet. Rainbow dash and rainbow flash tomorrow ^_^ ... unless there are blindbags, in which case i'll be split : /
Single ponies are about €8
did you hear about a 'round 2' of blindbag ponies, RobotPinkie ?
yeah, I did
were the bags silver or purple?
ummm... both?
http://mylittlewiki.org/wiki/G4_Pony_Figurines#Euro_Wave_II
pretty sure it's first wave of blind bags, though
ah ok
wave 2 looks purplyer than wave 1
got Sweetie Swirl and Sweetcream Scoops, so definitely wave 1
well, my FS looks a lot better now, but still not as good as it could IMO : /. still, it was my first try ; )
ah ok. and you have 5 now? which is the 5th?
Rarity
=D
twi pinkie rarity =D
Sweetie Swirl apparently "loves ice crearm," whatever that means...
she loves ice cream then
13Whoa, people started talking about.

"creaRm", not "cream" :P
sleep then :P

Yes, it has been for 2 days
Nothing has been deployed
MeteorVenture, how many vidya can YOU play at once? :P
Delicious~ ;3
>implnnninindifnkdngniying
lol i actually haven't tried i don't think
>implyingDUNdeeperleverage...sirpieceofcakefightthepowerawhaaatootimplications
i haven't either, but i want to
but as long as i had only a few controls per game i bet i could do a few at a time.. assuming i could access the controllers correctly.. you know
it matters
:P
ewwww
That's right, paedo.
Not pedo.
ew
:P
that;s funny and disturbing at the same time
they really might as well have a paedo magnet shirt if they have the other stuff they got
also i have no idea what's with the a
a TAAAAAACK of the killer BIIIIII scuits
bitch got owned
dark heart?
Meh, the 7 year old didn't do it first.
Hey guys
The bat man guy did.
ohai Pinkie_Pie again
lol
That was the fastest response I have ever gotten
"good boy"
Considering you had to type my name to..
talking to him like he's a dog, nice
ohay Pinkie_Pie
i need to learn to do that
Hi
Pinkie_Pie, leaving aside the fact i can type 'Pin' and hit TAB, i am a very fast typer
Didnt know about that
this is delicious
And I can type very fast as well
hmm, ep 3?
Last time I checked 80 wpm
glad to hear it Pinkie_Pie :P
And thats with a preset thing to type
but ya daz i really want to try and play a few games at once.. also there is a game on kongregate kinda like that where you play 2 games at once.. then it adds another and then another
they're extremely simple but it's really hard
oh yea, i just got a new phone like a few days ago, and i havne't had a new phone since about 10 years ago (had a crap blackandwhiteo ne) i'm very happy, it's all new to me, blah blah blah. so, what are good things to get on the android market?
MeteorVenture: seen it, 4 at once it's crazy
LOLLOLO
does nobody here have an androind phone thing?
I do...
i've never ever had a phone lol
then, um, what's good stuff for it?
i have the two FiM soundboards, but that's it basically
I dunno, depends on what you like? :P
well i just got it and never had anything like it. what's good? :P
I'd recommend getting the facebook app, if you use Facebook...
i got it here, so i can get stuff.
ok FB app
and the same for other stuff like that
my wallapper is pinkie pie :3
the built in apps for FB and Twitter and stuff isn't all that good
I do Daz
yay, recomendations, AllisZero ?
recommendations *
Hmm depends but I certainly recommend ANGRY BIIIIRRRRDSSS
okie, i heard that's free
Oh yeah
Daz, this is mine http://img.ponibooru.org/images/f0/f08f6d3d38776a24addc3a2c7e5d2d92

yah Pinkie_Pie, he so pro he got it hooked up to computer so we can see it perfectly :3
Talking about PSP, does the new Dissidia worth to buy ?
Is*
dunno, perhaps NewDCD can answer
9it's good
9but if you have the old Dissidia
9I warn you
9half of story mode is the old Dissidia's Story mode
9as in
9the new characters have a prequel story
there you have it folks
9which happens before Dissidia 1
9and then Dissidia 1 happens
9and all of the story is included in the game
9with the new World Map system and all
Seems interesting enough
9perfect adjustments: complete
9we're live
9gonna make a stress test, so gonna invite people
I wish I could read japanese
Then I'll be able to buy Zettai Zetsoumei Toshi 3 D:

Daz, I have downloaded a file manager called "Astro" which seems pretty good, if you want to manage the files on your SD card
9QUATTRO BAJEENA
9TOTALLY NOT CHAR AZNABLE
9NO SANK YUU DAH
Then there's the JLPT kanji demo (because I don't have an account connected to market so I can buy full)
RobotPinkie, the 'my files' thingy built in seems to be fine thou. copy paste delete etc. what's so good about Astro?
(like, what does Astro offer)
You can see more of the file system, I think, but if you're happy with what you have there's no real need to switch
I think I once saw those yellow ships in biology class
ah i see, thanks RobotPinkie
Then I have "Abduction", where you're a cow who gets abducted by aliens :P
haha lawl
Kimi wa dare to kisu wo suru~

...RobotPinkie there's android pony boot animations...?
I don't know, Daz
if there are and they work i will squeel
oh "Paper Toss" is what it was called
ah tried that one. deleted it, it's 'meh' to be honest
not playing on a high enough level :P
haha
cannot decide. pinkie, AJ, FS or RD boot screen?
i don't have anything more installed at the moment, except for swedish TV app which won't work outside Sweden...

So, E_N, what do you wanna do?
Lol
:O
Watch DCD play his game
It's awesome
Do a fanfic that focuses on Celestia and Luna
:D
We really CAN'T do anything anyway
yo
Specifically, Veti-lestia (Celestia acting like a more benevolent Vetinari, which is how I usually interpret her in the show).
whats goin on?
9>I loaded the scenario I just beat up again by accident
9>instead of saving
9ah well
but you could do a completely original trollestia and luna republic shipping story!
9I'll beat it later
ohai all
:3
just passing by
9that's it for me. Gotta go buy a meal
why shipping?
Celestia-Luna shipping? That's.... no.

Oh, it might screw up if you start your sentence with a comma then a number.
Oh, it might screw up if you start your sentence with a comma then a number.
But meh, I can't be bothered to fix that.

RobotPinkie, maybe. But he can be seen as either horribly funny or extremely narcissist.
College is awesome Daz.
.1
whoooaaaa
lol
Maybe I'll have them visit Scoltsland
4fkaskdfk
ohshi- there are 20 brushable ponies...
wat RobotPinkie
20?!?

lol okay
I'll skip Mane 6
:P
or just link website?
http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Playful_Ponies
playful ponies
ah i'm there myself already, just as you posted that. thanks aniways ^_^
and I'm not counting the playsets, btw...
so i have the 2 promo packs from Europe?
Yup, you do.
I see
...I still wanna buy 'em all :D
Me too :3
:3
i wonder if I can afford them all
lol I definitely can't right now... but eventually
yea...so what ones you have available to you?
E_N
um... none that I can find, really
bla
but you can buy:
you can buy the mane6 and which other ones? which ones are available where you are
No idea which ones are officially out here
latest naruto ep just a filler, and they using my fave music piece in EH scene : /
but ones you can get. so you got mane6 and you can get cheerilee?
...yeah, it's gonna be 5 eps of filler, I think. I'm skipping it.
Yeah I've seen Cheerilee and Lily Blossom
welp, i just saw a 23:09 episode in 2 minutes ; )
but they were sold when I had the money :P
mfw i actually thought the sasuke vs naruto was coming 2 seasons ago. i should read the manga haha
alright, tomorrow's episode
or well "had the money", I'm not going to use my savings account for ponies...
...it's another filler with bugs or something
yea RobotPinkie same
'im just gonna use the money i have for random stuff, but use it mostly on ponii
tomorrow i'm getting RD and RF : D
when I have extra cash, I guess
7Yes
Nice!
yay~ you'll remember I went to get it about a week ago, but didn't :P
also gonna be on the look out for blindbags, if I see them i dunno what i'll get i'll be split between them
i DID scout around other shops here like 'Juguetelandia' and a few others you won't even know xD. but yea, no other toy shop has them other than Toys R us, who have a shedload of G3 and G3.5
Cool
I feel pretty shameful walking down the girls isle in Walmart, but I puff my chest out and do it anyway
ikr Pinkie_Pie
Lol, not that Hasbro makes good toys anyway =(
Seems every store is slowly starting to get G4 here now
well i'm really happy with their current toys Pinkie_Pie
hurray RobotPinkie !
13Nvm, I was gonna mess with you as Rainbow_Dash and Bubble_Berry, but I dont like having doubles
13Lol
You are?
still mostly G3.5, but every store I've been to this week has had at least SOME G4
“But I made charts and diagrams and everything,” That new fanfic definitely has good characterization for Twilight
Orly?
well, sure, Pinkie_Pie, the toys are cheap, my Daisy Dreams' head and body colour are different a little bit, and the hair is really cheap stuff, but it's fun to style the hair, the eyes and ears, and general shape is very well done and cute
Lol, my dad is funny.
whathedo?
I got one of the basic rainbow dash's, and im gonna keep it in the box
I cringe every time I see it though
He was teasing me.
THE CUTIE MARK IS BACKWARDS
D=
oh gawd
HHHNNNNGGGGG
>my little pony and porn, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Sexy ponies? MY LITTLE PORNY!
>Do ho ho
my Fluttershy has a cutie mark on only one flank, and i know another fluttershy has some sorta flowerthing on her leg
>Rest of family laughs
You dad actually said that to you Prince?
Yeah he did.
still, that's pretty harsh
Meh, we joke around a lot.
I floored him for it anyway.
^
Have you made him watch it?
Lol
Nah, he said he would some time.
HAHA, oh wow
But I never bothered to get him to.
my dad's just 'I like Bonsai, and people think it's stupid, so i odn't mind you liking Ponies.' He's very creeped out by me brushieing though, but doesnt' mind the show or figures
I don't think it's really his kind of thing though.
My dad knows NO ENGLISH, and dub isn't out
Your dads are pretty bro
how's yours then AllisZero ?
what is brushing
Daz: What language, again?
My dad's dream was for me to become a soccer-loving responsibility-ridden drunken womanizer
mib: Brushing your MLP toys
Man, it feels good to be out of the closet as a brony. I know some people are laughing at me for liking it, but eh...
But yeah, what my dad said is pretty standard for our conversations, I said he looked like a saggy old scrotom - as I said, we joke around a lot.
FreezeFrame: I am Spanish, living in south Spain, Granada (, 'El Jau')
AllisZero: You could still love footie
Oooh, Granada is beautiful, I've heard.
lawl your dad's awesome dari
what aobut .... was it you dari who watches shows with your mother a lot?
brushy brushy
He sounds pretty funny, dari
FreezeFrame it kinda is ^_^
dari, he's got a "saggy old hip"^
Well I watched the Inbetweeners with my um.
?
Problem is, though, I turned out to be an animeloving nerdo, so he's resentful fo that
mum*
Which was pretty lulz.
ah it was you, i remembard ; )
Sounds like the jokes I do with my dad.
RobotPinkie, how are your parents?
alrighty, cyall again. Should be back in 2 1/2 hours
He's pretty funny when he's not making racist jokes....
bai Dermathil
Later Dermathil
Lol footbal.
There's no ponies jokes here, my dad and I mainly joke about fitness stuff
football*
I hate it. :P
Which is really uncomfortable, since most of them are about blacks, and one of my best friends in high school was black.
As a spectator sport anyway.
I dunno entirely, Daz. My mom thinks it's kinda funny, but she likes that I'm starting to sew again.
you're sewing? nice, i used to do that. that's awesome RobotPinkie
In general people seem to think it's laugh out loud hilarious :P
Dumb fabric
/me waves at Kitten
inb4 fumb dabric
/me waves
NOPE
c'mon cmon
somepony say it
except for a couple of friends, who don't really go for the whole judgemental thing
bumf cabrid
...don't make me open a new tab just to get my inb4 :P
this anime i'm watching is really weird
o u darius
well that's good RobotPinkie
I am having my Kindle read to me....not the most effective, but it is giving me aural input in addition to occualr
occular*
RP, do it like me
what anime?
If your friends think you're weird for being a brony
Convert them INTO bronies.
I've got four and counting.
i've converted 2 and am doing so on a 3rd :P
http://www.welovefine.com/product.php?id_product=737
4? nice one AllisZero !
FBI CRAB MUD, Daz
lawl, i would buy that Ziltoid
fbi crab mud? i don't understand
>saw Alonso instead of AllisZero
I'm gonna buy the Fluttershy one
wait...
ALLONS-Y ALONSO!
that shirt is fantastic
I'm working on it, AllisZero :P
dumb fabric i c
$25 for a shirt, aint even mad
"Your name's alonso?!?"
you started fluttershy, RobotPinkie ?
Not yet
mine ... *looks* ... is still not quite dry
almost thou, and i uite like it :3
i'll post pics soooooon
Think I'll wait until I see how yours turns out
Quick question.. Is the stream offline or is it something at my end?
lawl, compared to the styled one, the onest still fresh out the box look rly horrible xD
might use the same method
offline, Grandil
Ok thanks. :)
offline
it's one of many i saw RobotPinkie, but looks good :3
the TAIL (always the tail) could be better
from what I THINK it'll be like when i remove straw
lol yeah, that's the big problem with my Pinkie Pie, too
but the hair lookslike it's gonna be so awesum
you tried 2nd go at PP's tail yet?
Think I'll just do a rarity twirl, pretty much
Not yet, Daz
might do it tonight
rarity twirl looks the best.
during GARRYMOOOOOOON
and take your time RobotPinkie, after all it took me a week of busy before i even did FS :3
mothafukken Gary
yeah, I can't really fuck it up more than it is, though, visually :P
suddenly, i want to rewatch 'friendship is magic bitc'
haha
perhaps using curlers on tail? curlers making tail go straight down?
Hetalia Axis Powers
curlers?
gonna use straw and hair pins :P
I think it'll look pretty good
Hmmm, don't know it
Okay, back to classes for me.
yah
and okay bai bai FreezeFrame
later FreezeFrame
also the 3rd nonbrony i'm making into brony, i showed him 'party of one' then 'anthology' then two or three vids such as 'avast fluttershy' that sorta thing, then friendship is magic bitch. he went from (and i quote perfectly) 'pony fetish pony fetish, show for little girls you're gay' to 'it's alright i can see why you'd like it.' oh yea, i was with him on
skype, he was laughing a LOT
so i think we have a new brony in the making ^_^
/me contemplates lightly learning web design
i wanna show another episode next, whenever he's on skype / whenever i see him IRL next
Cool, Daz
I think I'm gonna try my hand on Pinkie's tail again...
OOOON THE MOOOOOONNNAAAA BEE-YETCH!

Lol
07Streams up

Robot, are you taking good tair of your Brush pony?
A wallpaper?
tair?
and Pinkie_Pie i have a wallpaper cycle of about 5 pics. two are mine and 3 are RobotPinkie 's. all are brushie brushie pics :P
so i hope RobotPinkie takes another pic of his finished Pinkie Pie
Brushie brushie as in.. ._.
also, Pinkie_Pie, dunno if you forgot, you can hit TAB after the first part of a name
I.E. 'robo TAB'
RobotPinkie
mib_0uosky:
said earlier, maybe you forgot? :P
It will likely take me forever to get into that habit Daz
brilliant!
what episode we on, Luna ?
07ep 5
ah, glad to be of assistance, mib_0uosky
It took me 20 minutes to get into the habit Pinkie_Pie
thanks
:D
I got to Ep 140 something on Pokemon, but then I saw MLP, and it seemed so boring in comparison
MLP killed Pokemon for me
I even stopped buying the cards and stuff =(
07:D
it took me http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/7/70/Rainbow_dash_evil_looking.PNG ten seconds flat :P
well, glad you're here Pinkie_Pie, where we like both \o/ woohoo~~
i think i've only seen one episode of pokemon
Thanks Daz, Lol
looks like my night is set. pokeman, AI TEE craud, then Haus
/me needs to start collection Pokemon again
I wanted to get a card of each legendary
I stopped watching and following Anime because of MLP, Pinkie_Pie
And I spent 50 dollars on this http://homepage.mac.com/viper.fox/card/2009DPt-P/043.jpg
I barely had any cards, and even the basic games i only had some
Same here Allis
...so worth it Pinkie_Pie
For some odd reason, 26 episodes of FiM completely killed most animu series for me right now.
yea i know that feel Pinkie_Pie, AllisZero.
I know, Ash's Pikachu LV. X.. I had to have it
XD
pffft animu, manga is much better
:P
Oh my, I've seen that anime
Same thing, E_N
gurren lagann 'killed' most animes for me. i always watch first 3 eps to see if i like a show, but it's been AGES since i watched a full anime cuz it just isn't as good : /
Well, the feeling for me, that is
I only ever read manga now
it's the one where each character is a country of europe from around the time of the first world war, right?
or something like that
and now we're on this topic, a few videogames killed most, because of how good those few i played were :D
it was pretty random, with short episodes
yay, good gaemz
Fallout killed most games for me
haven't played it yet, but want to
okay, tail's set in place.
God, it's AWESOME
:3.
good luck, RobotPinkie.also gotta sak
THIS is episode 5?
ask *
yea Pinkie_Pie
do you just get the hair wet with hot water, then leave to dry RobotPinkie ?
I love this episode
Could of sworn Sabrina wasnt until later..
uh i've not seen this, but is that guy Brock?
Wait
Nvm
XD
sabrina, Pinkie_Pie ?
Well with the tail that's all I did, Daz
I derped a little there Daz
lawl Pinkie_Pie
ah ok. but what aobut hair, RobotPinkie? i just got it wet with hot water, moved it a little, and left to dry
with the mane I wet it, curled it and then poured hot water on it
9HA HA HA
ah yea, a bit of medium water, to brushie it all straight, then hot water
9HA HA HA
9also
NewDCD is back?
07ohai DCD
I think that's probably the right way for Fluttershy, Daz, Pinkie's got some tight curls though
9Dat poster
Quite awful VO, IMO
9it moves the plot forward
First episode I ever saw
9Ash were you staring at her ass?
Ash the ass man
sure was xD
No clue what the first episode I saw was.
9PEWTER GYM: Our Sign is typed on typical MS Word Fare
Enter Brock
PEWPEWter gym
"special" rules
9this is the guy always chasing ass?
9huh
9he acts too stoic
mfw i only just learnt the word 'stoic' by using a dictionary after reading a fanfic not ONE week ago. i need to L2 more words
haha, so this is how they meet...
XD
9Goooooooooooooooooo my voice just brooooooooooke
http://pokemon.neoseeker.com/w/i/pokemon/1/1a/Brock_fight.png
i learned stoic because of final fantasy 10 i think
9Ash: The Perpetual 10 Year Old
MFW in the latest pokemon show he's 8.
@pony The pony that is a Pokemon Master
6 The pony that is a Pokemon Master is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
He's getting younger.
FUUUUUUU
mfw you knew that Dari
soon he'll be a baby
8 is way too young for him
@sexymeter silvermane
6silvermane is 333446% sexy.
@sexymeter silvermare
6silvermare is 1636464357375% sexy.
I was told that by all the pokemon people on a server. :P
9"No!
yes, silvermare IS sexyer
sexier *
PIKACHUUU
9and then Pikachu exploded on both sides, spraying gory bits all over the Gym
Lol DCD
9well, that would happen if this were Adventures
never seen this, but is that guy brock?
So, in other words.. Pikachu exploded twice?
9because Adventures is HARDCORE
9it's his DARTH VADER
Wut
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuur Dari
You've never seen pokemon before Daz?
Are you serious?
d'aaaw
E_N: You want the network?
9I wonder how much does Brock get paid as a gym leader
WUTR?
Not really
lawl, no dari i've not been livin' in a cave xD. i mean this episode specifically
9"JUST LIKE YOUR DAD, ASH!"
>his good for nothing father. is it him?
if so ;____; tears
Prof. Oak is Ash's dad.
WHAT ISI??
Then Garys is related to Ash?
OH MY
9nO
inb4 car batteries hooked up to Pikachu's nuts
9No
9his dad is Gary MotherFucking Oak
i mean, dari, is that bearded guy brocks 'good for nothing dad' ?
9he fucked with the Timestream and got her pregnant in the past
Mebbe.
Such a pleasure to have you here Applejack.
9and that's how he earned the title Gary MOTHERFUCKING Oak
Prof. Oak is always around Ash's mum's house.
if so, i feel for him, he called himself 'good for nothing' : /
9because he fucked the woman known as Ash's Mom
Whenever he calls.
Perhaps you could accept your invitation into my humble Bunker?
gee, thanks
9it's in her birth certificate!
Daz, just watch the episode
okie E_N
what if ash's dad died in a war?
if u invited me again =P
This ep is one of the best
>shocking
Lulz
Dat pun
>mfw I was pretty much right
(time for Worldwar2wonbyjapanese theory)
9I actually once thought
one of the best E_N ?
One of my fav's anyway
hmmmm
okie
13So, welcome.
9of making a Pokémon fangame in which you play as Ash's/Red's Dad during the war

13Well..
oooookay...
9also Lieutenant Surge was under him during the war
13You could say that we are.. Throwing him a mod welcome party
7mfw Valerie Jean
o wow NewDCD that's actually not bad an idea
and including lieutenant surge would be excellent
4mfw colours!!!
Fly higher you stupid bird.
13Yes, Colours
9the battle system would be more Shin Megami Tensei than Pokemon though
4xD
13Now, what is your opinion of Valerie?
9what with your human characters fighting alongside their Pokémon
Are you giving up again, ass?
4hes like everyone of us, awkward but nice
>weak to electricity
IMPOSSIBRU
>magic pikachu kills it

13And, perhaps a tyrant?
Goooooouu

anyone here see Cardboard Warfare?
13But of course
4xD
13Now, you could be a part of our.. Plans

God, I love his accent
I dunno Daz, I think some service providers block you from switching boot screen
there's a way to do it without 'root' ing your phone
lololol
not working for me,, guess i'll have to root my phone
Ive done it...
done what, madponyking ?
well, just make sure you know what you're doing, Daz
news flash:
It dosenot work!
ikr RobotPinkie just got this phone 2 days ago :P
doesn't madponyking ?
OH GOD I JUST BROKE THE INTERNET
Sry mistyped
madponyking, are you saying that the custom boot screens, which have many replies saying how well it worked, do not work? if not , : /
NO im talking about the google into google stuff from the show or whatever...
yes your right
ah ok
Cat it is very very weird
/me yawns
lol
hey...what exatly we are watching?
The IT Crowd
british comedy series
Tom Hanks
why you keep saying that? :P i don't get it
is that 'thanks ?
Tom Hanks is thanks
Tom Hanks = T.Hanks
lol yeah
Eeep.. How much did I miss?
oh wait is this the episode where the ... bra is ... v-volatile?
not much Grandil
Oh great.. :)
RobotPinkie: i'm still here tryong to get Pinkie Pie as a boot screen :P
yay Pinkie!
Regarder
and i like all 6 as much, RobotPinkie, but pinkie's animation is her happily bouncing. :3
OH GOD THAT IMAGE

ewwwwwww
>mfw My internet decides to derp.
gentleponies, i have now rooted my android
sup Dermathil_ !
and that is srs bsns
wow, it was that easy, Daz?
(wait 'til you hear what wonder bra would do about the abrakadabra)
RobotPinkie, incredibly. now it should be easier to do the bootscreen. do you know about rooting then? i only found out about this like 1 hour ago, but im fast :P
2 day old phone rooted :P
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
MY BOOBS ARE ON FIRE xD
I know about rooting, but I haven't really looked up the risks
Hey. Can whoever is incharge here change what we are watching whenever they decide?
ah :3 ok RobotPinkie
ya, i rooted phone JUST for pinkie :3
madponyking: sure could, but we have a schedule for tonight. I.T. crowd, then some House MD
if you're around more often you migh see us (well, them) take requests
HOUSEEE??
YAAAAY
after this, AJ, it's House MD
scheduled, and streamed, by Luna
Hug her
sweet
/me is having multiple orgasms
I do want my boot sound to be "It. Is. ON!" though
o lawl
RobotPinkie: ikr i can't decide for my sound. what goes well with pinkie bouncing?
Rarity, that is :P
yea yea i got that :P.
I dunno, a "boing" sound? :P
cuz I like house and this stuff as much as the next guy. But would it kill anybody to play some SCRUBS?
lolz
All the floors in hyrule?
HELEN
hmm RobotPinkie somethkign better than that
Nope.avi
madponyking: ask around, some one might play it
lol
lol
HAHA
a haha
plzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplzplz play some scrubs?
eww
Maybe Pinkie going "WHOO! WHOO!", Daz?
i honestly can't remember that. uness you're on about AJ trophy thin
thing *. but that has AJ's voice too
No, it doesn't :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwIphm5wVAs
bear in mind i can edit anytyhing, so could be part of a song too
Pinkie keeps doing it after AJ leaves
It sounds like a car alarm
ah thanks RobotPinkie and Pinkie_Pie
xD
it's a good idea to be sure. a bit strange for a booting animation, and she's bouncing for boot screen
atm it's that, but any other things?
are you ready FOR BREAKFAST?
what are you guys talking about again?
WATER FILTERS DOWN THROUGH MY HANDSOME CONKERS
Well, when she bounces during the show there's a "boing" sound. I'm not sure what else would fit to it.
madponyking, replacing the boot animation and sound for my phone =]
aaaaaaah. I see.
...RobotPinkie i have it. thanks.
i'm gonna edit the boing t oplay in time with bouncing :P
HAHA, oh wow

What if I ship caramel with HIMSELF?
2,14 and E_N would be wrong, as Caramel is a very loving pony :P
2,14 herospirit: ANY shipping :P
maybe Apple Fritter is kinky, and wants to be his slave?
Wait. If you hate fanon, how can you love Caramel so much?
:0
Silvermane x Caramel
He only had one line. :0
2,14 Caramel is too much of a loving guy to do disturbing crap like that, he would politely let her odwn
2,14 down*
Silvermare X Apple Fritter
2,14 also I don't hate fanon, I hate fanfics
What if it was a one-time thing?
Like couples do?
