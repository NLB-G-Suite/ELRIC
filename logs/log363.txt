Aku is Evil. Nightmare Moon WISHED she could be that evil. Discord has wet dreams of being that evil. Deal.
lovely scenerey
Expressions are boss
He is like Discord, but more incompetant
samurai jack>jackie chan
erboh:aku vs discord
This obviously wont be a trap
discord could kick aku's ass
The vampire episode of Jackie Chan Adventures scared the shit out of me when I was younger.

AKU KILLED THE DINOSAURS.
if you've read discorded ponies
more incompetant? that's oximoron
it makes sense
aku has to TRY to win
oh man, I just remembered the /b/ music video that overdubbed Aku's intro in the very first episode with Bon Jovi's Living On A Prayer
Lets watch Jackie Chan Adventures next
Discord could beat Aku
Discord is a manchild
discord just has to snap
Tovler: in that time, the sun will explode

Big Gorron Sword
8 bit winterwrapup makes this even better
THIS IS SPARTA!
overly dramatic much
Sumica: it's cartoons get used to it
OSHIT
ooh, ooh, another anime we should watch on here some time? Gankatsuou
Giant Yak.
oh my god I managed to sync it perfectly somehow
soo, whatcha guys/gals arguing about?
what the FUCK is this sword?
Frostmourne?
that sword better be worth it
thats one way to make a sword
this stream is really good.
so, will Bronystate only stream hearts and hooves or the entire marathon?
Well that is a very complex fording system
were we arguing? im sorry...
/me googles it
that ice got a sweating problem too
perfect sync and everything
RawketLawnchair: Fair enuogh
enough*
Xion... who let you in the bronystate?
00,10man the manufactureing cost of this sword must be insane
damn, that sword be pimpin
And thus, the first Diamond Sword was crafted
the sword is made of Adimantium
diamond sword
Tovler: it's the COunt of Monte Cristo
YOOL TOR SUUL
Alright. I'm going to bed. When should I come back? 5 hours from now?
Wouldnt the Sword melt/

OH, AND GUESS HOW THEY CHOOSE WHO GETS TO USE IT?!
Sumica: magic *snort snort*
That isn't diamond... IT IS NEODIAMOND
iron sword ice enchantment
and this is what happends inside a crafting table in minecraft.
...What's the name of the reforged sword that cut the ring off Sauron's hand?
Magic runes.
00,10I see no magic
Diamond is the hardest metal known to man
the mareathon stars in5 hours

Runes yet.
Now there is the magic
Sumica: and now?

God this is needlessly complex
A hammer fist?
look. dwarven weapons
the entire Mareathon, not just the new ep
probably one of the most visually interesting anime out there, save stuff like Redline
Went through all that just to stick it into a rock
what?

THEY ARE DECIDING WHO GETS TO USE THE SWORD AND FIGHT JACK.

hmm, I need to spread the word out about Michiko to Hatchin
And now he stands there

It would have been funny if the sword wouldn't come out of the rock

Killed his siblings for that.

Phase4: yes, so keeping things somewhat simplified is important in kids shows, but when you act like kids will only appreciate the lowest common denominator, you're shortchanging them.
Yup, I still liked the Spring part of this bad episode.
Wacha!
IT IS LEFT AMBIGUOUS. ON ONE HAND, SHE EVIL, ON OTHER, SHE WAS JUST REMINDING HIM OF HIS DUTY AND STRENGTHENING HIS RESOLVE.

the kind of stuff that doesn't get kids thinking, or engaged is LCD. Stuff that's simple, colorful enought to keep their attention, but not enough to actully leave a lasting impression on them.

WEIRD SCIENCE
Phase4: when I saw lowest, I mean in terms of quality. In all honesty, Telly tubbies is meant to keep a baby/toddler occupied with visual stimuli. It's not meant to have any sort of depth to it because, well, the audience isn't old enough to have solid memories in the first place.
To be fair he is a plant
:O im so exided for the frist mare-a-thon

FLUTTERSHY YAY!

"where are you agumon" ...he says to an empty hallway.

eeyup
/me is laughing hard thinking about tomorrow's episode.
10 feet of air!
Anywans has anyone played Kingdom of Alumar?

Phase4: dari would get a kick out of it
...agumon got a trash can stuck on his head.

MahBoi777: :D
rainbow dash named her turtle "tank. you now know equestria harbors heavy armored vehicles.
Lauren Faust likes Turtles.
You know it could be after a water tank
I like turtles.
Tank is the best.

90s cartoons in general sucked, however there were a fuckton of cartoons
I'm going to sleep :(
im back. I just got hit by a train.
Luna: thanks for the Nostalgia dear!
See ya guys later
bye
gn deadly
Xionponychan: :$
THE FACT THAT SHE NAMES THE TURTLE TANKS INDICATES THAT EQUESTRIA HAS IN FACT DEVELOPED MECHANIZED WARFARE AS THERE IS NO RELEVANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE THING AND A WATER TANK.
I like trains
Guys, I'm off to bed too
wait...
see you all later
And it was never said for there to be fire arms in Equestria, and using them. So they may have them but not use them

No, Dtox
BUUT now theres more music...
opohh man love this song
Dtox: impossibru
I'm not crazy about this one tbh
only song I dislike is "oink oink oink"
The art of the dress! WooHoo
Play Equestrian Idiot.
in other words, catoons allso follow the 90/10 rule
just because it made me cringe
but I'm not sure I'd say I dislike it as much as don't like it as much as the others.
the stream runner is prolly AFK asleep
Like this song!:)
MahBoi777: :D :) :O
why do you hate pinkie pig?
thus the sleeping luna
this song is alright
lol
or not
well, one song i don't like is the cutiemark crusaders song during the fare and the oink song but thats pretty much it
aka http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_Law
there's VHSCRCAP
this song is one of my favorite from the show
I will never stop hating this series until it is blighted from existence. and Seeing as the 7th series of Digimon will be bringing back past goggle heads as villains, Marcus ain't going anywhere anytime soon.
LOOOL YES
Yes!
@JamesIsABrony I thought it was Art of the Dress too:$
Phase4: Yeah, but there was a remarkable lack of cartoons in the 00s
I am the type of brony every brony should know!!
the cutiemark crusader song was meant to be bad
HEY EVRYONE THERE IS GOING TO BE A BRONY MEETUP IN LAKE GENEVA WISCONSIN!

MahBoi777: @___@
Terribly sorry

the anime boom in the early 2000's meant relatively cheap, fast content to fill airtime.
Pie.
Releasing control of this form
You wiggle your tail OINK OINK OINK You wiggel your nose OINK OINK OINK you wiggel your rump OINK OINK OINK and you shout it out OINK OINK OINK

Tovler: that was a big help to the anime boom, yes, but the first 7 years of the 2000's were when Anime and manga got big followings over in the west, and thus when TV stations started cashing in on it.
SPIKE!
An Ass!
Three Asses :P

Like how Sci-Fi had "Animondays" and Disney was buying up anime rights for Jetix and Disney XD
What the heck's that R for?
IMMA EAt YOU
Chazburger.

This girl is Fluttershy

What is the name of the black girl anyways?
Prayin mantis dont care

Hers is the only name I don't know

Honey mantis

The snail would solve everything
the FUn has been doubled
I mean, the female VA for Naruto made sense when he was 12...but the guy's 15 now. His voice shouldn't sound like a girl trying to growl.

*facehoof*
/me brohooves DeadlyDerp3.
4 clicks, interesting
YES!
People got the rigbht idea

SPIDERSES
I've never seen english Shippuden *note to self… fillers are over…. watch Shippuden again*
night deadly
how'd they get small?
But seriously. What is the Black girl's name.
The bus shrank them
"I learned a ton about science... and wonder why actual school isn't fun."
"This stuff is all sticky!"
it's a web!
and then they got ejected
I've been reading the conversation for hours, but never bothered to contribute
lol
they shrunk in the movie and never grew back
stuff is al sticky: THATS WHAT SHE SAID
that sounded so wrong
You dont say.
Spiders *waves hands around*
I almost want to watch the new Spider-Man movie
....
How did she get changed like that?
oh lord
frizzle in the nizzle dawg
Mrs.Friana?
theres a new one?
O.o did she say cless
that accent
granny smith
Frizzle is clearly a magical girl.
oh yeah, remake right?
No it isn't.
The bus is her power.
Phase4: yeah, it's called. The Amazing Spider-Man
ARNOLD!
that was a bad pun
Arnold, you pessimistic asshammer.
Meh, new spider-man looks kinda off.
ARNOLD
Arnold. You are the spike of Magic School
Lies orb sipders dont hunt with webs!
"I wouldn't tug on that Keesha!" (that's what she said)
LAG!
Gets stuck in web, nopony cares.
no tim!
mrs frizz, get your damn students off the web
Who else wanted Season 3 of Spectacular Spider-Man?
Visually it promises to be impressive, but the bits of dialogue they showed in the trailers just sounds awkward and stilted.
Now Sccisors
they just stood there lol
scissors? lol
Suddenly, small scissors.
her french accent is boss
magical school bus
WRITEity: I personally am looking forward to a more blatant snarky Spider-Man
dun dun dunn
seems legit
he sounds like the guy in Psychonauts
he's in Tranquility Lane!
You know. I bet he is fired for saying that
fired saying what?
didn't hear
LIIIIZZ
Also I was looking forward to seeing The Lizard since Spider-Man 2
"I am in some sort of Magic Bus."
oh lol
If that doesn't sound crazy I don't know what does.
IZ ONRY GODZIRRA
Trapdoor spider?
nom
Ok, that was kinda clever.
lol
thats right kids
did anyone here play the spiderman game based on the first movie?
get near the spider trap
Yes!
You know. Those bugs are now dead
and get consumed
eh, the more I see of new Spidey, the more I feel like they're trying way too hard to be different from the Raimi films.
im a teen not a kid
"something juicy" mmmm

so they stand right there
I HAD BETTER BE MORE THAN 3 FEET AWAY

wub spider
Spider: Ohai
>beetle at 6 o clock!
Spider : Hai guise, wuts up in this thread?
>is facing the beetle
I can handle spiders and all kinds of other crap, but not centipedes
The Raimi movies. ssssssssssssssss… they didn't suck
*facehoof*
into the spider hole!
I mean, yes, in the comics Peter had a bit of snark to him, but he was also much less of a dick than the ads are portraying him. Also, he never sat in class with his hood up wearing fucking guyliner.
I din't know what I was trying to say
Bugs
i hope they run the derpy hooves epi
Then they get eaten and the story is over.
short attention span beetle
happy ending

Can Liz see through the fourth wall?
So whats going on in bronystate tonight

And really, my biggest issue is that Garfield doesn't look at all like peter parker. he doesn't look smart, or kind. he looks like a cut-price edward cullen.
O.o

getting trapped in a spider is weeee?
And then she died and the class was crushed by a drunk stumbling through.

MahBoi777: missed me :P
I LOVE THAT EPISODE
10,02The only way I can think of toping that would be to have a remixed song of 'Shoo-Be-Doo' when Sea Ponies are finally introduced in G4.
/me does a barrel roll
*dude*
INSIDE RALPHIE WAS THE BEST EPISODE

Are you an artist on Tumblr?
10,02Way to go buddy, it took us three days to﻿ make that potato salad. THREE DAYS!
Xionponychan: .....it was a hollow victory:S
sorry. I'm a military guy… an 1-star generals deserve their respect.
My computer needs a new hard drive and I'm using a LiveCD of Fedora
can you believe My Little Pony gave me a promotion

Oh god, what if its Samurai Pizza Cats again?!
Three days for potatoe salad?
Ah. Too bad. I like meeting artists of tumblrs I follow.
aparently the water at my school has been contaminated and we have to boil it before drinking it
That's kind of a silly.
MahBoi777: but you won :D

animaniacs

nostalgia
AFTER SCHOOL CARTOONS
So saturated~
Funny that furries killed this show
how so?
MahBoi777: are you okay :(
eh, look up the history
10,02Random thought: Too bad Animaniacs aren't on air today, they would have A LOT of new material to make fun of with today's shows.
13and now our song is done
What did you 00s watch after school?
how did furries kill this show?
Wait did they really?
bronies are bizarro furries
SuperBrony64 IKR???
Yu-gi-oh
my childhood has returned holy crap.
Pokemon
I've never seen 00s r34 toons
Animaniacs would probably get taking down in days from overly butt hurt asshatters
Wasn't there another version of this? Where there was a Granny and the loonys?
i think someon
Similar but bizarro different
Xionponychan: yup, never been better, LOL:D

acs'
Me?
That's Baby Looney Toons Red_Pegasus
lol
MahBoi777: heh okay :)

That armor isn't very well designed. The scaled bit should be on the other arm in order to provide more stability for the shield. If it's on that arm, it just makes swinging the sword harder.

Is it going to be blank until the marathon. I hope not.
hunting ponies is not for everyone
I like to think Equestria is the alternate universe to earth

one-man band
His lungs must be THAT big
Kammerjunk: #SillyFilly
Too late.
Because Rhy doesn't always take her fighter on missions
04Keep that to Leo and Rhy
I need a link to this.
suddenly parasprites thousands of them
04Like you said he can have basic training
Have a friend who would die.
Helicopters should have more than enough firepower
Starflash: I keep my sense in my pinkie finger
04But I'd rather him not
If you travel from the Schengen zone to the US, is a normal id card enough? Or do you need a passport or even a visa?
Actually
TIME TRAVEL
I think this guy also did U.N. Owen Was Her?
good answer
we probably would have a specialised pilot
sup
Hey brony
since we're going on missions
Ictiv: 10 pts
Hey bronies. Exicted about 5h of ponies? :3
00,10indeed Gabe

Oh my, this guy doesn't need more arms than two
Play it Sumica after this

Mare-a-thon
marathon
oh kool
Caboose: hub marathon
/me tosses 10 points on the Australlia sized pile of points.
Scootaloo: WAHAHAAAA
WE<3PONIES Mare-a-thon
I thought the marethon was for valintines...
04And the pilot can complain that "Everytime Rhy takes the controls, the damn thing crashes"
rebound ikr?
/me runs
normally Rhy insists on piloting it
Well Played! *Applause*
they are entirely useless points though, except for the fact that you now have more of these than the others
yes lmfao
(yay)
did he died?
gimme a straight answer. why are we not having any megas.
Rhy's pretty damn insane at it though
?
now that's what I call multi-tasking
asians did it...
he needs a breather
everyone complains about her flying
but she's one of the best pilots
04Apache DO A BARREL ROLL
lmao
04And NS
04I had the idea
when dodging fire, YES
I'm an asian and I can't do that!
I LOVE THIS

Lol
CalycibosOfBjor Luna usually streams megas, but she's not here now, plus, she's stream the whole two seasons

xD
04My first thought was the "Demon of Singapore
Oh my GOODNESS
04for some reason
HEAVY!!!
Oh hi, fluttercry.
and MEDIC
except we'd have to be careful not to overpower that
dat burn the rope
I love this burn the rope song.
05,15hi
burn the rope?
04I know
and now i need some water
04But as you said, she's an exceptional pilot
since technically evading 5-10 craft /might/ be okay, but not more than that
Awwww. Why do all the good shows get put on when I'm not around.
mario?
pingas
04yeah
hell, 10's probably a bit too much
NOSTALDIA >_<

/me hugs fluttercry to make her into Fluttersmile and also for warmth apperently.
:'(
yeah
This is a castle... but it's not Roy's one.
Oh thank goodness, i nearly thought it was Mario is Missing. that game was a lame excuse of edutament.

Don't blame me for having the mental image of a very sad yellow filly with pink mane sitting quietly in the corner
Mario Kart 7 was great, but where did quickrace go?

Anyway, have and Epic Man Hug

well, the real reason the internet exists has always been to upload and look at pictures of funny cats
The third alicorn?
SOPA
Weird Alicorn.
SOPA is dead :)

Season Two in Italy...
*facegun

In the new ep, Twilight becomes and Alicorn and fights Evil Princess Celestia
When i hear this song it always makes me think of a pony with a sword in his/her mouth as said pony stands on ther rear legs.
Caps lock on |:
/me grabs Celestia and Twilght fleece blanket
so heart warming
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon need to be...erased...
No-One will forgive Gilda for what she did to fluttershy. SO LET'S KILL HER.

In the new ep, AJ joins up with Eminem to kill discord all over again.
What time is the Mane6t rooms going to open?
04And when they enter the airport/leave the plan they pull out weapons and try to take hostages, the mercenaries posing as hostile troops from another country
I think I should play gta online and shoot some heads to distract me from the lack of sleep
well technically they can override it with authority
does anyone still use dial up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmZ2a8sCzz4

And Trixie is ther.
why is everything with ponies in it so awesome?!
because...
g4 scootaloo is better than g3.5 scootaloo
pony43932: everything is made for ponys
Pinkie: "The earth is round, silly!"
pony43932 everytihng
Huh? if eny thing, Eminem would summon Discord.
04The mission is intended to mislead, and while they take hostages Rhy and Nathan (somehow) avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Because ponies are awesome?

Anyway, remember Gilda and when she made fluttershy cry? She's still alive. Let's fix that.....
Is it Lyra or Heartstrings? What's her real name?
Let the vase kick

RYTHM IS MAGIC

DAT FLANK

or Lyra Heartstrings for combination
04I mean
ILL SHOW YOU WHINNING!
DAT DAT
04Ok that's too short of an explanation
I don't remember it being this bad.
MOAR ASS
I would clop her flank until she whined.
DAT WHINING FLANK
Let me guess
11,01Whining is magic.
Agent Heartstrings, codename: Lyra
dem flankz
wat
not going to make one
just wondering
04Leo's really professional, but he's still more agreeable than most of the other mercenaries
Did they make rarity so a pervy animator could animate an ass?
what song was that
WAT
well duh
guess denied
NOOOOOO

05,15Skyblaze we don't talk about that
What
can't remember the fic name but I like the idea that her birth name is Heartstrings but she chose Lyra after
i have
more boring songs
oh dear god!
FUCK CUPCAKES
Unfortunately.
What are you talking about Dr i'm 100% trust worthy =D
BORING

We are the best fandom. ever.
xD
Skyblaze, dat be forbidden
heavens light
EVAR.
WOW HUNCHBACK MUCH
poor discord :(
hey this is rarity room right?
i doubt that :S
*facepalm*
Pinkie and Doc?
6_9
That is one of the topics that are not to be spoken of here.
what dafuq?
poor Quasidiscord
10,02Oh no, a sad video ;A;
chanel name length exceeded
Anyone remember My little dashie? Read it for the 3RD time. Still sad.
Yeah lol.
don't try to make Discord a good guuuuy
let see if it works
young discord looks awesome~
shed.mov is not spoken about either
05,15no TOMi this is the mane chat
sup superbrony.
04Which is why he thinks that gunning down the kids, even though they weren't actually trying to fight back, is a bot cold even for him.
...Wouldn't he be better suited for Hellfire rather than Heaven's Light?
I'm gonna be in that corner over there --> and be sad.
nope, dont work
NOO BUFFERING
There is a hellfire version
Discord is not a good guy
04He convinces his CO to let them take them
WOW HE SINGS AWESOME :O
That should totally be on a Seapony Valentine
this vid is amazing
ikr
Yes he is
This looks like its gonna be heartbreaking.
Discord is best.....uh......Draconqeus?
@fluttercry i cant get into rarity room
04And basically says that they work for them or they die.
10,02Sumica, Name. Now. :>

i love this so much
I don't have much time to read My little dashie, Only Fridays :C
you nailed it bro
My little dashie gotta be the most overrated thing I've ever read
I think this PMV is fueled by celestia x discord fics
careful discord she's a master troll
Discord is cool because he's evil and he likes it, so don't make im good!
#Phase4IsBestPhase
05,15It's closed for right now. They will open up shortly
Ugh, i hate being reminded that i have no one to enjoy Valentines day with. Im just glad i have work that day to take my mind off of it as well as Mass Effect 3 to do the trick.
"Roses are red, violets are blue, you're awesome! Shoo be doo be doo"
@fluttercry thank you very much
And this is why the bronys will rule the internet.
HELLYEAH
this community is just the BEST! EVER! period
Fuck Valentines' day

No one for valentine's day? What about family & friends?
I love how the fans want discord to have some kind of dark and troubled past where he used to be a good guy. But then was turned dark. When in reality he's just a sick and twisted manifestation of chaos that enjoys mentally breaking ponies for his own amusement.

07,01morningz
10,02Some important announcements before it begins.
11,01Morning everypony else.
I prefer YYYY/MM/DD - It's organised per year, month, THEN day.
The Wonder Years, I think
10,023 AM....*mumbles*
y/m/d or d/m/y. i'm fine with either. its m/d/y that gets my rage
Also, I'll be you guy's friend, just sayin'
07,01welcome to my world
11,01Silly Shizuka. Minnesota isn't it's own country yet :p.
0,14everything's so dark outside
/me grumbles
Phase4 why?
lol Shizuka, you forgot the aussie viewers
10,02Anyway, as you may or may not have noticed from out notice in the newsletter, we are implementing some changes to which channels will be open to chat in throughout the week.
its night here
About new episode info: Inb4 everypony's favourite brown pony
Starflash: It ticks me off too.
It's like, WHY?
13shush... i have no sleep...
Ictiv big mac?
Dat Ashleigh.
Dken2021: Brown...
Oh hi, Luna
Starflash: its stupid and ugly and breaks the lowest to greatst or greatest to lowest and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ohai Luna
In other news, I'm used to getting up at 5 am. At least I have ponies to look forward to and not school
Brown...
yeah
BROWN
ohai Shizuka , didnt see you there
04Anyway
04Shower now
04brb
Please tell me I'm not the only one who heard Ashleigh there.
10,02As of right now, we have opened up the Mane6 Pony rooms to be used for chatting, which you can join by refreshing the page.
Of course not Kammer XD
pretty obvious~
Oh, good. I wasn't sure whether it was in my head or on the stream.
ah, a good episode to begin the marathon
10,02(Hmm...Hearthswarming Eve...indeed a good episode)
13or, if you're on a normal client, you can join #rainbow_dash, #twilight_sparkle, #fluttershy, #pinkie_pie, #applejack, or #rarity
I often hear Ashleigh, Tabitha and Tara's voices in my head.
and it seems the main channel will close soon
side rooms are open
blah sorry Drake
mum came home
Eeeyup
Can't believe no one noted that Pinkie seeing the future is canon
.... I don't think I want to go in those rooms
isn't rarity the room used less?
More Ashleigh.
AJ I guess.
Ohai
Kammerjunk naw this is RD...nvm
Do ho ho.
guys
<3
autotune.
well, time to take a shower then
Was I the only one who heard "Furry and friends"?
10,02From now up until after the new episode stream, the main #bronystate chat will remain muted. Please choose one of the Mane6 rooms for chatting.
autotuned fuggibles =w=
bucking Jar-jar
furbies needs to make a return
07,01this room will stay muted the entire event.
for the lulz
kabwooey
Even announcer is shocked Jar Jar stayed in after all those edits
Jar-jar almost ruined the film to me.
furbies were fun but they were a little to silly
ALTAIR
/me hugs
Wildly Whacky...
He aint Gene Wilder
Mane6 is muted? hmm.
Mane room*
why?
I'M ABOUT TO BE BRILLIANT
no they will be open in a few min
05,15because
Ictiv: He might be Depp, but he will never be better than Gene Wilder.
oh ,yes main room is closed
Oh, Derpy.
You are so random!
because? o.o
dat reason
poor fluttershy
Kammerjunk: Depends on the role though
main room is closed to lessen the hassle on the ops
Yeah.
10,02We hope you enjoy the event! Have fun!
I can't see Wilder as Jack Sparrow.
Yeah
stepping onto the dock in that establishing scene of Black Pearl
Not exactly a Gene Wilder moment
Not quite.
But I also can't imagine Depp with a goat
that scene always seemed rushed to me <_<
Also, that magic-pulling Pinkie moment makes perfect sense to me.
Give a sign if you know where that was from :D
i'ma run an experiment, i'l broadcast http://derpy.me/bronystatescript in the mane6 rooms and see how many clicks i get
I haven't watched much Wilder.
13Phase4: don't spam
13you've posted that enough tonight
:|
Shizuka: not spam, just once per room. wondering how many will click
and i'm late
13you've been doing that all night
hi everyone!
He was doing that all night?
Phase4: I approve of your browser support, or lack thereof.
Phase4... go to bed plax
"Get a better browser" Do ho ho
Quick question: Did the vote take place yesterday?
Shizuka: one last time ?
Because I saw the update on Google Docs but newsletter said it will be today
Princess Platnium is best princess. Besides Luna of course
I'm partial to Starswirl in this re-enactment.
pegasusususususes
WHAT
dat spam
Broadcast! No!
and it died
reload the stream
/me opens a can of spam.
broadcasts back
I bet the Pegasi did this!
I blame the earf ponies
Neigh, it was the unicorns!
just click play
Phase4: Unicorns would never do such a thing!
Phase4: I imagined you in a full on 18th century british admiral get up yelling that as if you'd say "Reload the Cannons!"
i'ma post it. lets see how many click
done
last time for the night, i sware
;p; Ictiv
lol'
Good thing that the night is technically over in a little while
13Phase... we don't do bots here...
These commercials really put the ones in Denmark in perspective.
Shizuka: I do bots. In fact, I have made love to this machine!
Shizuka: never used it for more than that. it was a short experiment i did some months ago
And now, upon retrospect, I ask 'why?'
I miss r0m
hi
/me hugs back~
yeah
last week was kinda shit
r0m is in sillyfilly
but yeah, birthday this weekend
And he's so lonely

Yup.
we're moving onto other things prolly though

D:.
Aeiou
erbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
You... You... Earth pony!

Kammerjunk: :)
i meen :O
i'm impressed actually :o
here comes another bunny rampage.
those are too close to each other
ebrbrbrbrbr
XD
whats this
12 pages is way more than even we do
looks like an interesting movie
I just managed to finish it
how this could happen?, i'm all out of cereal ._.
and it's hard for me
of course we're typically fucked up when not doing school work
neat, another dr seuse
as this is the first time I've heard of differential calculus
hell
Seuss no?
play dough dentists
They believe in a better chicken.
04NS
Scootafarm
I had to get help from my school maths teacher
04this is what happens when you do extension
No, they weren't.
and heh Altair
They were thinking of money-
they belive in better scootaloos
you get high too quickly
Better Chicken= Flying Scootaloo
do ho ho i r funny
Scootafarm anyways
Ictiv Flying scootaloo...
Why don't you just use baking soda?
You'll see
Drake
no it doesn't
extension's fairly easy
honey i shrunk the kids
this is tutoring
thers a movie i havent sen in a while
seen'
>get high too quickly
Phase4 I love that one.
for some reason, that was one of my favs 10 years ago
Rescuebots: Because we need to make more money off of Transformers.
rescue bots. not at all related to transformers
Hey look, Transformers clones
too often
Um...
Starflash: its meh now i think back to it but its ok for kids
fuck, every time I see you you're either high or drunk
I think they are part of the Transformers Franchise
04^
That still makes my statement valid.
I'd not watch it again, rly. Ruins the memories
breaks mine though
nah
Yes, Ictiv.
i'm typically both :D
It is part of Transformers.
It's even called "Transformers: Rescue Bots".
i would have thought soo, but they didnt mention it in the ad
that too
rabblerabblerabble <.<
No, I just Google'd it.
Oh yes
Altair, meet culex
culex, meet Altair
you can be fuckbuddies
Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Altair.
04>fuckbuddies
04>#True-Flame
04Good lord how long has it been
y hello there, mr. culex
I think Twilight squee'd with joy when she found out she'd be playing a character whose mentor was Starswirl the Bearded-
quiet in here
Kammerjunk: probably
shit half of the log got cut off ><
being ponies they can actualy make a squee noise
._.
no one said anything don't worry
Lucky them.
I wish I could squee.
also run /znc *admin set keepbuffer $me true or /znc loadmod admin first
You can squee :3
you gotta practice a bit though
oh and I miss my favorite episode, curse you shower!
Anyway, Drake, still, being young while they're training is fine
04I don't like it.
So, that's two different ways Ponyville was founded?
Kammerjunk: I think what the show didn't let us see was Twilight Nerd all over the face about Magic history facts
I'd watch that,.
all over the place
GabeMoist this is founding of Equestria, not Ponyville~
not sure how i typed face
Oh, wait.
I read it wrong.
Now I look like a dirty old bastard.
04I'd much rather prefer them being at least mid-teens the whole thing
04Because 12 is just far too young.
04Even 13
I thought you meant Twilight spew out magic history facts.
Kammer... nah nevermind
dat special somepony
i got the logback, i'm just tripping out.
/me poofs
Kammerjunk: Yes. She listed a lot of facts
Starflash, so where did the Earth Ponies live?
Now you made me wonder what ever else could you be thinking of and welll...
/me coughs Moria
You are a dirty, dirty filly
I didn't read what I thought I read!
diggy diggy hole?
[SWAG]GabeMoist: Yes and singing epic dwarven songs
Twitchy twitcha twitch-a-twitch!
say it with me, 1, 2, 3 ...LALI-HO!
Earth ponies are dwarves o.o
Lali-hoof
indeed
Starflash: I knew that.
well miner ponies
it is now head canon
/me is trying to remeber the song from the start of The Hobbit where dwarves sung of the old days of The Loney Mountain
Starflash: Three Rings for the Unicorn-kings under the sky, "Seven for the Earth-ponies in their farms of stone," Nine for Peagi, blessed to fly, One for the Dark Queen on her Dark Throne.
So yeah. Earth-ponies = Dwarves.
alright seeya
Yup
fine
Hey everypony.
15 then
Ohai Meanwhile
Hi, Meanwhile.
lali-ho Meanwhile
0414 and a half is alright
04because the year needed for training
Kammerjunk: Nightly throne perhaps?
and then, gandalf was a unicorn o.o
Or shadowy
Oh no
Ictiv: Sure, why not. I'm not artsy in the least.
Have you guys seen the most recent episode blurb?
Gandalf is an angel
so technically he can be anything
Gandalf is an Alicorn.
ohh shi another crazy twi ep?
so much pony
also hi Meanwhile
Twi recieves a message from herself from the FUTURE
hai Meanwhile and TheGreatAndPowerfulT
hi everypony
Shut up.
Spoilers are permaban.
and [SWAG]DisplasedAcorn
I'm already liking the new twi episode
That's not a spoiler .-.
It's the blurb.
Meanwhile: i read the blurb :3
that count as spoiler ?
it will be an awesome episode
Ohai Acorn
Warnings have been given for that, IIRC.
It's rather hard to spoil something that hasn't been publicly seen yet.
hey gabe
I don't know.
i mean it's posted on eqd
Hm... Kammerjunk Three to the Unicorn Lords in their forts, Five to the Earth Ponies, working all day long, Nine to the Pegasi blessed with flight and one to the Night Queen on her Black Throne
http://derpy.me/HCe9C heres the cover image from eqd, not a spoiler
SuperBrony64. I request your attention briefly.
People were pretty mad when book 5 of Harry Potter was released.
we kinda are already spoiled the last episode with the new alicorn, so.... yeah
Kammerjunk, why? Book 5 was the best book
yeah
What was the title?
well
Lucid: Because Snape kills Dumbledore.
they should be 16 when they're ready
And that was spoiled.
That was book 6
book 5?
Same difference, I never read any of them through.
5 was Order of the Phoenix
that was order of the pheonix
Yeah that was 6
oh right
Phoenix
6 is half blood prince
04Right
thx Ictiv
/me spell bad
It was kind of obvious that Dumbledor was gonna die
04Then they hit 17 and 18 over the course of the story
Lucid: But not to people standing in line to buy the book.
the last one was called....
yeah
"Sparrow of Death sat upon my Dumbledoor"
Deathly Hallows.
what was it again
thx
Raven*
and Leo hits 21 or 23?
that was a good read
/me facepalms.
Ictiv dat raven.
Hmm, speaking of spoilers. I should read the book of the next Twilight movie, and when the movie premieres, spoil ALL the things
0423, so he's older than us and more of a mentor
I have it, and I know I read it, but I don't remember it like, at all.
Lucid: Better idea, go to Twilight.wikia.com
I thought thw twilight books were done with breaking dawn
wait
I didn't even know there was a Twilight Wiki
their making more twilight books?
Dken2021: Yeah but it was broken into two parts in the movie
ohai [SWAG]GabeMoist
it's the internet, there's wikis of everything
Lucid: There is a wiki for everything
This is true
Did YouTube plan this?
For some things there is multiple
Youtube, it planned this
for example the Elder Scrolls has at least 5 separate wikis
i blame SaxyPretender
one of them not on wikia though but at uesp.net
if youtube did plan this, then why take down episodes?
Which was not helpful at all when I was trying to find things.
0,14mfw I got pinged XD
I swear, if we don't see the Last Roundup in the fan favourite mareathon, I will be shocked.
(thats my new way of saying hi to sxy)
SaxyPretender.
0,14oh hai everyone
hai
Hey SaxyPretender.
lali0ho SaxyPretender
Dat SaxyPretender :)
its so wierd to be awake this early and not on my way to work
hi SaxyPretender
These commercials are oatmeal.
Saxy Y U NO % in here
DAMMIT LORAX, GO AWAY
SaxyPretender: Wanna join my Jazz jig?
He speaks for the trees.
ultraviolet?
0,14sadly, I haven't played sax in years
Yeah
oh look, the original, now let's see how much it compares to the new movie
i hate those 'digital copies'
so he's 20 when he first finds us
this is before the 'it requires windows moie player' thing
movie'
Oh wow it's only 11:45.
I was asleep for like, 5 hours .-.
^same
Whatswawuggla?
WugglePets have NOTHING to do with Build-a-Bear at all.
And were in no way inspired by it.
04yeah
Or, rather, "inspired".

Kammerjunk: Damn you Kammerjunk! Don't correct yourself before I could correct you for you
I'm Meanwhile. How's it going.
Ictiv: You cannot correct me! I am incorretibable!
...incorrectibable*
I can't even spell words wrong right.
Incorrectable.
I like incorrectibable, myself.
Though incorrectibable sounds better.
Kammerjunk: You should have typed incorrecti-babel
I should?
hidden refferences and all that
Yeah. "Hidden."
How does her horn fit in that hat?
For Science!
Swneaky
Meanwhile: Magic.
You really should know this.
It's bigger on the inside
I know I know.
Ictiv: Twilight is a Time Lord.
She probably got it from Doctor Whooves

Not the Bees!
Conclusive knowledge from one observation, you're a bad scientist Twi.
AAAAAAAAAAAA
Kammerjunk: You've read about new episode?
No.
okay then
/me zips mouth.
ah nick cage, we only remenber you from that movie
Dken2021: That movie as in every movie?
poor twi
Beeeeeees
sure, why not?
Bees, my god...
Derp'd like a baws
Oh Derpy, you so silly.
derpy spam is probably happening in the mane6
When I contracted vampirism in Skyrim, I ran around screaming "I'M A VAMPIRE, I'M A VAMPIRE" Because Nick Cage
That does not compute.
Let me correct that: NOOO! BEESMAN! LIVE DAMN YOU! Damn... Beesman was a good soldier! He'll be avenged... Bees... My god
I can't play Skyrim seriously since I got the maximum level block perk.
I just sprint shield ram into everything and it goes flying.
05,15Phase4 you were correct. something about derpy gets people excited
on the plus side it makes her super easy to find
That's because Derpy should derpy derp.
Derp da derp da derpity derp derp.
fluttercry: Her curie mark is thought to be a few bubbles. But technically it is the molecular structure of the red matter that creates black holes
wat
05,15woah
So he draws our attention
she*
or he
that explains so much
oh the days when she was the pony waldo, good times
I'm not sure anymore
fluttercry: MFW Pinkie said 'woah' right after you.
That's some mighty fine logic.
Bah, can't be bothered to find a face.

/me has read to much fanfiction
And I don't <3
I'm more suprised that I woke up this early than anything else.
04NS
04What city should the climax be set in?
Doozy always reminds me of "(Someone) and Tucker vs Evil"
Meanwhile, another Lorax commercial
no idea?
04I'm thinking that, at first, Japan, China, Russia and the US are all against each other
don't forget Korea
whats this?
:{D
04but by the time the climax rolls around Russia and the US have teamed up
a new ad
04hmm
04true
Great.
Now we have bedroom eye'd blankets.
04Korea and Chine?
For children.
04China
oh GAWD, it's horrible. And I though Stompeez were bad
That's not at all creepy.
looks like the mane6 are not sure how to respond
04Actually I'm thinking that Korea just pisses everyone off
marketers have no idea how to market for children
/me wants pony stompeez
Kammerjunk: For -ever alone- Children
YFW the child didb't control that dog.
didn't*
i want to burn one
My swag would go off the charts with them
i liked this movie
Fry up is best brunch.
aparently people think it was bad but i lik eit
04China, Japan, Australia, Indonesia
like it*
04With Russia, US and Britain on the other side
Leftover pizza is best breakfast.
johnney depp movie was ok
Phase4: It deifently wasn't bad... But it would have been infinitely better with a Singing wonka
Come with me...
And you'll be...
NO
D:
In a world of Pure Imagination...
i honestly prefer it to the 60s one, charlie was a jerk in that
but the singing was good
Oh alright Kammerjunk
/me hums Pure Imagination.
Thank you for that.
Phase4: Charlie was a real kid in that
I prefer world of pure inebriation tbh.
Kammerjunk: Let me fix that
If you truly wish to be...
Times have changed...
lolol Indonesia
And we've often rewound the clock!
Since our Twilight has got the shock, when Rainbow Crashed on her top!
Isn't Australia allied with the US?
:why:
lol
If todaaaay... Any shock they would try to stern
Australia sucks up to them remember
04Yeah, but we're constantly relying more and more on China and Japan
'stead of crashing on Twilight's top, Rainbow'd simply "jump" on her!
04I can see us siding with them rather than the US 30 or 40 years from now
Is that a song or just nonsensicals?
In olden days mere sight of ponies was looked on as quite ominous but now all knows: MLP goes

Yeha
Never heard of him.

Now
/me clears throat and continues.
But, but...pony D:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as-whCYL4ns Here's somepony singing Porter's song.
i think the reactions to this episode were a little out of proportion
Well, not "somepony" as such, but Ella Fitzgerals.
Bad salesmen too who once sold Hasbro's stock, now get to make money off of Lauren Faust!
Fitzgerald*
They deserve oust!%
Seriously, I don't really see the religious connotations
I see how it can be interpreted as such.
If Rainbow's fast tricks you like, if Spike's mustache you like, if Sun Gods you like, if Galas you like, if Big Mac you like or Smarty-Pants you like, well nopony will oppose!
and now i know how to pronounce 'plymoth'
But my response is my same response to all religious topics. I really don't care.
level up
When Ev'ry nigth, newer bronies are intruding on pinkie parties in web-chatrooms...
A new day blooms!
the difference betwene relegion and pinkie is pinkie is stasticaly significant
/me is happy.
and way more fun
prayers to results cant be seperated from chance
Yeah, for a start, Pinkie makes sense.
squee
dohoho.
04Plus, we're far more multi-cultural than the US or Britain, and we're more in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere near our old allies.
04New Zealand would probably follow us
Troll face disengaged, continue.
The difference is that Pinkie sense can be measured and observed in real-time
When Rarity (Celestia bless her) can get fgrown old met to love her, then i suppose: Anything goes
MFW I'm listening to the song now.
HONK

So sweet and tasty~

10,02You know what upsets me the most?
asblock to the rescue
ad*
I'd make a comment about how news on the web reminds me of a certain something not getting media attention, but I don't want to start a discussion.
no, tell us sb
SuperBrony64: Quick question: Did the lottery take place already,
what upsets you the most?
?*
SuperBrony64 people who are not silly fillies?

07,01I won the Beeeee movie

how is that bollywood movie btw?
inb4 bee movie wins the b movie :P
Grats anyway :)
Well true, Drake
07,01Bunti aur Babli is ;)
but assuming that all passed
We both know that Australia loves sucking up to the US and probably won't stop anytime soon
And what on earth is that?
04I dunno
04With Julia Gillard out of the way...
/me run
04s
07,01that's the Beeee movie ;)
Yes, but what is it? .-.
Twilight is the Batmare.
oh cool, it's some sort of road trp, neat
lmao
04Why not give Australia a bit of a spine?
/me 07,01is gonna help you expand your horizon and discover bollywood movies
Well sure
oh god...
I'm fine with them living alongside china
Not sure if want.
04with a cool prime minister for once
so basically
07,01you want ;)
I can't wait for Crazy Sparkle.
Luna: Did you see Danny Kaye movies?
/me is unsure but will give bollywood a chance
I've been to an india food mart that had a wall full of bollywood movies
it's China, Australia, NZ, Korea etc. against US, Russia and Britain
04Instead of these craptards like John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard
07,01^
I think Japan would side with China
04yeah
probably should've picked one
04Japan -> Australia -> China
since >Japan and US
07,01eeyup
does not compute

Hey
0,5Vacant room is vacant
I actually didn't mind Kevin Rudd
2,14 SHHHHHH
Luna: I have no problem with watching Bollywood movies but more importantly: Did you see any Danny Kaye movies?
let's have Whitlam back
actually he'll be dead by then
04Kevin /was/ better than John but-

04Whitlam
Dat rainshroom cloud.

04From what I hear in History he was awesome
Bollywood's are pretty good. some of em, at least

I take that as a 'no'.
07,01I've seen some Ictiv
Ah
Good then
Kammerjunk: it is :'(
Bollywood movies it is
I bet Celestia was moving the Sun like that.
she does move the sun so...
0,5Oh I was
yeah
I knew it!
But, well, the Sun is the same in a relative way.
But you're older.
Extreme multi tasking: Writing, being in a chat room, watching MLP and Watching Doctor Who at same time.
Drake anyway
Human multi-tasking is a myth.

You're focusing on writing stuff while chatting in a chatroom and watching two shows.
yay multi tasking, I was in pit in marching band, had accessories
but my attention is swapping with such speed i'm pretty much doing them at smae time
10,02Please don't talk in #BronyState while it is muted for the stream unless it is something important like an official announcement.
07,01yesss more ads!
04Then the CO of the Aussie section basically says to us and the few other kids that we either work for them or die.
Kammerjunk: I know right?
0,5FOREVER
Because everyone needs more ads.
An endless cycle of ads
Forever.
I feel like the sever from "The Parting of Ways"
server*
04and then training
Ictiv: Because you know what they say. Severe interference is shown when even very time tasks are performed at the same time.
04NS, will we be stationed in Australia for our off-duty segments or somewhere else?

See?
I say we'll be stationed in the US

I swear, if you can't get Ronald McDonald to sing Ran Ran Ru at this Ronald-gram, it's not worth it.
the only ronald I will think of is the japanese one
The Lorax made me cry
Dken2021: You mean, Bow Chicka Bow WoW,
?*
0,5Hey now
Excuse me... um Lady Ronald?
0,5Enough sexual talk
What was the other 4 episodes?
I hate the Lorax. I mean, it's an okay movie I guess, but it reminds me way too much of my AP Earth Science class
What talk? Bow Chicka is a legendary bow Wielded by the Elven hunter Elenamos
And it was a Bow that Wowed everyone who beholded it in their sight
thus the phrase
Dashie was embarrassed because it happened in front of Applejack.
You all saw it.

Why don't mods have there own channel so they don't have to screw with us?

wish i had that much internet
StinkomanFan but thats the best part of them being a mod!

I thought MB/s meant megabytes per second and Mbps meant megabit per second.

Why do you have that much?
I only have 50 Mbps.
i use that much
They're horrifying
And it's not like I ever use 50 Mbps.
plus its running on 5ghz instead of 2.4, so i get that even when the microwave is on
Ictiv: I hope that's not after series 4 of the new show.
SoDoctor Whooves is safe?
wow 120 mbps I only got 3 mb/s
just to make sure i've not said this wrong, its 120megabits/s wireless. my internet connection is only 16mbit/s
Who was it who said "spock the drogon" like, ten minutes ago?
I don't use wireless anymore because walls are annoying.
Kammerjunk: 1 I actually like Matt Smith
I said it
Phase4: still more than i got i hate living in the middle of nowhere
2 that is from Series 1 of new show
episode... 4 I think?
Well StinkomanFan this is for you then. http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg
I don't watch much 9th Doctor.
:D
Big_Jakeintosh: problem is i'm not in the middle of nowhere. aussies get screwed in terms of internet
Kammerjunk: How about old ones?
Ictiv: Series 1, EP 4 is Aliens of London.
but the new router allso got native ipv6 ^_^
Kammerjunk: Okay, then another one
I've watched very little of the old show. It's so LONG.
and i'm on the one provider in aus that suports it
the one that plays in 2012
Because IPv6 is really all that useful
Kammerjunk: And it's also great
My photoshop ability needs work.
Oh, right!
That episode!
especially 4th doctor <3
I want dat scarf
I completely forgot about that episode.
Lucid: it is, or at least will be when people start to impliment it
It's 6, BTW.
not much off then
also: Are you my mummy?
I want my mummy.
That episode was creepy.
mummy?
That episode was awesome
Just like my mummy
Not as creepy as weeping angels, but sstill.
I like the shoutout to that episode in The Poison Sky in series 4.
My Little Mummy: Jack Harkness is Magic
Jack Harkness IS magic.
the reason i need the fast internet is file transfers, i would run an ethernet cable but people keep tripping over them
why is it some of my favorite episodes involve ponies going nuts
Dat construction
wireless', not internet. *derp*
Meanwhile: Indeed
Jack Harkness is sexy.
Meanwhile: Also: That's what dem lady folks did say
But not as sexy as Tennant.
Indeed.
Secrets and lies!
Kammerjunk: Tennant isn't sexy. Tennant is Swaxy
http://i.imgur.com/UooHK.jpg Nice spread.
Meanwhile: Did you just make that?
I did actually, but it took me like ten minutes.
Meanwhile Lolwut..
Manually cutting the head off?
Yeah, I'm not exactly photoshop savvy.
Neither am I.
I just use it to make Rainbow Dash salute in front of the Danish flag so I can hang posters up at school.
Stuff is fun.
I'm keeping that picture in my fav bar.
What'sawuggle?
That is apparently.
And it's totally not a Build-a-Bear ripoff.
Overlook the fact that until you add stuffing it's a skinned animal.
Yup.
my brain is yelling at me
"go to sleep. go to sleep."
Phase4: Tell it to shut up when you're watching pony.
Just sayin, but Pinkimena looks better then Pinkie Pie.
We don't have Black History Month over here.
I love Pinkie Pie, but I do like Pinkamena's look.
We don't feel like we really need it.
Pinkamena is terrifying.
I know, dreamy isn't she.
Kammerjunk, where do you live, because I want to move there
And schizophrenic.
Lucid: I don't think you do.
But Denmark.
Best face.
Gah
still wierds me out
Well, it's probably better then here
I love her crazy face.
has anyone here read 'shipping and handeling'?
derpy fanfic?
Lucid: "Here" wouldn't happen to be Hungary, would it?
I need to visit Hungary sometime.
You don't
I do.
you really don't Meanwhile
Pinkamena: "They're coming to take me away, ha ha, to the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young mares in their clean white coats and they're coming to take me away, ha ha!"
I really do.
Meanwhile: Okay... NEVER to the capital
Budapest? spelling optional.
you spelled it right
party invitation, the hard way
Is it just me, or is Pinkie a litte... grey?
Now you know what trains/planes not to get on
Kammerjunk: i recon this was planned
Half my ancestry stems from Hungary, I need to at least visit.
Also, don't take any planes to Denmark.
Meanwhile: Visit the country. Not the cities.
We're slowly ruining the country.
Oh, wait.
That's called a government.
People are relatively nice in the country
inb4 3d cake
there it is
And no more grey.
THEY KNEW
In a city you're going to get robbed blind by ligmate businesses as soon as they realize you're a tourist
Dat bucket of turnips.
legimate*
perhaps the greying thing is part of being the elements of haromny?
harmony'
Phase4: Or losing one's self
Phase4: Yes, but this was way before S2.
I've been to Jamaica, they try to rob you literally when they know you're a tourist.
Also, Big Mac was greyed out in S2.
Kammerjunk: i know, and discord was planned pre pilot
Exactly! FAUST KNEW!
the thing you are watching is allso coming up next
neat, find a pet
What if Faust planned this entire show to attract adult men all along?
no... may the best pet win?
whats this one called?
Same thing.
Kammerjunk: thats kinda true
its for kids and their parrents
Phase4: It's called May the Best Pet Win, but ponies could guess it anyway.
Phase4: Yeah.
winder when tank will show up
*wonder
/me winders for a bit
Errday I'm winderin.
INB4 duet.
inb4 the best duet ever
Everypony sing along to the duet!
Anyone looking for a pre episode review? :D
Ictiv: NO
I only sing the song of the dragonborn. And only because shouting can counting as singing in that instance.
okay...
...Cannot unhear "horny gig".
So thanks for that.
"We touch a lot of things throughout the day."
he he he
I wonder if the Dovahshy episode will be on the list
4/5 kids recomend clorox
Phase4: I'm also very happy for them, and I'mma let them finish but Louis Armstrong and Ella Fritzgerald had the best duet of all time. Of all time!
Oh, no.
Is that the Rock?
It's not, is it?
Probably.
Good Goddesses.
It is
Kammerjunk: Feels like you're between a Rock and a hard place
/me twists mustache.
Do ho ho.
its not the rock it qwayne johnson
Same person.
Sadly.
lol i know
Then don't say silly things.
Hold on...
It's easier to call him the Rock.
Also, BRB. mIRC hates my guts.
The Rock, Wayne Johnson... Rocks often form caves...
what episodes have been on so far?

Qwayne?
HuhM
Between a Tom and a hard place :P
*dwayne
His name's Dwayne Johnson.

Can't blame mIRC, really.

Isn't he a really big nerd?
He had a cameo in Star Trek voyager, so maybe.
that episode sucked

MY FAVORITE SONG
Fluttergasm.

It was either him or one of the other macho actors that is a massive nerd. As in plays dungeons and dragons

/me turns volume up
Vin Diesel you're thinking og.
'night

I sing this word for word
Yeah, that's it
My bad
I love this song, if only because it's not in 4/4
A pet that will get you?
Beware Rainbow, for it will GET YOU.
audio glitching?

Meanwhile: Who had a cameo in Voyager?
o.o
Dwayne Johnson.
