Equestria is a dimension in my theory
equestrua us a batuib
you doubled the fun
equesrtia is a nation
yes
didnt u watch hearth warming?
I meant if it takes place on an established world, or is its own separate planet.
equestria is a planet and celestia is dumbledore
equestria is a nation**
Derpy!
I assume the stream's offline?
or not
6_9
Yep
derp
it seems
For now, I think
hunting ponies is not for everyone
I like to think Equestria is the alternate universe to earth
equestria is a country: ep 1x01, right at the beginning: once upon a time, in the magical LAND of equestria...
rip stream </3
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Pony Season is open!
equestria is a NATION.
NO
07,01stream be back up soon
OH NO
Shit, this might get ugly
Okay Luna
I know its a nation; that's why it has a duarchy. I was wondering WHERE exactly its supposed to be located. I doubt there's a chunk of land floating in the void somewhere.

I can draw an irregular circle. U jelly?

Because Rhy doesn't always take her fighter on missions
I need a link to this.
04Like you said he can have basic training
04But I'd rather him not
If you travel from the Schengen zone to the US, is a normal id card enough? Or do you need a passport or even a visa?
Actually
TIME TRAVEL
good answer
we probably would have a specialised pilot
since we're going on missions
and the heli has to go somewhere
04And we don't always go on missions alone
I can write the letter 'A'. U jelly?
I'm worried I might fall asleep
04Sometimes other teams back us up
wel
10 points?
well yeah, that'd be cool
I don't even know http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/129892
Alright
but we'll have to have a pilot
y does it say 56 minutes till pony? is the episode early?
04yeah
He's needs someone to do the percussion

did he died?
gimme a straight answer. why are we not having any megas.

04for some reason
except we'd have to be careful not to overpower that
05,15hi
04I know
04But as you said, she's an exceptional pilot
since technically evading 5-10 craft /might/ be okay, but not more than that
Awwww. Why do all the good shows get put on when I'm not around.
04yeah

When i hear this song it always makes me think of a pony with a sword in his/her mouth as said pony stands on ther rear legs.
/me grabs Celestia and Twilght fleece blanket
Laggynesh.
04And when they enter the airport/leave the plan they pull out weapons and try to take hostages, the mercenaries posing as hostile troops from another country
I think I should play gta online and shoot some heads to distract me from the lack of sleep
well technically they can override it with authority
does anyone still use dial up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmZ2a8sCzz4
i dont
And Trixie is ther.
because...
Pinkie: "The earth is round, silly!"
04The mission is intended to mislead, and while they take hostages Rhy and Nathan (somehow) avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Because ponies are awesome?

Yeah.
10,02We hope you enjoy the event! Have fun!
I can't see Wilder as Jack Sparrow.
Yeah
Not exactly a Gene Wilder moment
Not quite.
But I also can't imagine Depp with a goat
that scene always seemed rushed to me <_<
Give a sign if you know where that was from :D

Why don't you just use baking soda?
You'll see
no it doesn't

>get high too quickly

Rescuebots: Because we need to make more money off of Transformers.
rescue bots. not at all related to transformers
Hey look, Transformers clones

Um...

I'd not watch it again, rly. Ruins the memories
breaks mine though

It is part of Transformers.
It's even called "Transformers: Rescue Bots".

Oh, wait.
I read it wrong.
Now I look like a dirty old bastard.
04I'd much rather prefer them being at least mid-teens the whole thing
04Because 12 is just far too young.

Oh no
Have you guys seen the most recent episode blurb?
hi everypony
Spoilers are permaban.
It's the blurb.
Warnings have been given for that, IIRC.
It's rather hard to spoil something that hasn't been publicly seen yet.
I don't know.
i mean it's posted on eqd
People were pretty mad when book 5 of Harry Potter was released.
yeah
Book 5 was... The umbridge on I remeber but...
well
they should be 16 when they're ready
And that was spoiled.
That was book 6
book 5?
Same difference, I never read any of them through.
Yeah that was 6
oh right
04Right
04Then they hit 17 and 18 over the course of the story
the last one was called....
yeah
Deathly Hallows.
thx
Raven*
that was a good read
/me facepalms.
Hmm, speaking of spoilers. I should read the book of the next Twilight movie, and when the movie premieres, spoil ALL the things
I have it, and I know I read it, but I don't remember it like, at all.
I thought thw twilight books were done with breaking dawn
wait
I didn't even know there was a Twilight Wiki
their making more twilight books?
For some things there is multiple
for example the Elder Scrolls has at least 5 separate wikis
one of them not on wikia though but at uesp.net
Which was not helpful at all when I was trying to find things.

I'm more suprised that I woke up this early than anything else.
04NS
04What city should the climax be set in?
no idea?
04I'm thinking that, at first, Japan, China, Russia and the US are all against each other
don't forget Korea
whats this?
:{D
04but by the time the climax rolls around Russia and the US have teamed up
04hmm
04true
Great.
Now we have bedroom eye'd blankets.
04Korea and Chine?
For children.
04China
oh GAWD, it's horrible. And I though Stompeez were bad
That's not at all creepy.
looks like the mane6 are not sure how to respond
04Actually I'm thinking that Korea just pisses everyone off
marketers have no idea how to market for children
/me wants pony stompeez
didn't*
i want to burn one
i liked this movie
aparently people think it was bad but i lik eit

Times have changed...
And we've often rewound the clock!
Isn't Australia allied with the US?
:why:
lol
Australia sucks up to them remember
04Yeah, but we're constantly relying more and more on China and Japan
'stead of crashing on Twilight's top, Rainbow'd simply "jump" on her!
04I can see us siding with them rather than the US 30 or 40 years from now
Is that a song or just nonsensicals?
Yeha
Never heard of him.
/me continues.
/me stops.
Now
/me clears throat and continues.
But, but...pony D:
i think the reactions to this episode were a little out of proportion
Well, not "somepony" as such, but Ella Fitzgerals.
Fitzgerald*
They deserve oust!%
Seriously, I don't really see the religious connotations
I see how it can be interpreted as such.
and now i know how to pronounce 'plymoth'
But my response is my same response to all religious topics. I really don't care.
level up
the difference betwene relegion and pinkie is pinkie is stasticaly significant
and way more fun
Yeah, for a start, Pinkie makes sense.
dohoho.
04Plus, we're far more multi-cultural than the US or Britain, and we're more in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere near our old allies.
04New Zealand would probably follow us
The difference is that Pinkie sense can be measured and observed in real-time
MFW I'm listening to the song now.
HONK
pinkie knew
:P
this is the second time i've seen this today
