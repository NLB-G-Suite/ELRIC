02Rights managed
13and we don't have the financial stability right now to afford putting the ACs in
:O
we dont technically have summer here.....its the rain season
03That's the whole point of pirating it, you *DON'T* have to deal with that cra

dat kick
._.
03and it's only going to get worse LOL
wait for him to come back...
02I didn't know*
ugh
UGH
there he is
03Ubisoft did something like it, their servers went offline for a whole weekend
Allo everypony.
03hilarity ensued
meh
I don't have it out for people like you do though
lol
I did too
03if I read it has DRM
03I just go
03no9
I still wanted it :/
03and you couldn't wait for a cracked one? LOL
6how many times should i repeat
6I
6DIDN'T
6PAY
6FOR IT
Goaal! 30hours :p
02who did?
ooh hes changed his name
lol
/me dances AFK for a bit
6bought it along with a couple other things
02ah
6there was absouely no downside to this
:D
12wonderful
6I have NO reason to be upset in any part of this situation
Of course.
LOL
03well basically you had to give up games you could have made actual money from? :P
:D
03but whatever
I saw that coming.
6uh
6not worth my time
Really? He did that without any prompting?
hmm
2,14 sheesh...I try to have a nice relaxing stream and have to deal with all these idiots -_-
....
hmmmmm
MAXIMU GIGA!!!!!
bye
Wow! Look at that damage!
I'm having fun watching the game...gotta find some way to stay awake while at work :P
oops
Dat Gurren Langan
02Plus some people like having a case and everything like me
Oh ok
i'm not misbehaving am i?
/me behaves like a good boi
that would make things alot easier for the people that want to enjoy this...
03it's more that I laugh when people pay for something and then whine when it doesn't work because they didn't realize they were buying something with DRM :P
Is it that hard to behave?
6I wasn't whining -_-
03I never said YOU were
not at all
I don't know most of these faces
not at all
some peopel are just stupid i guess
lol
people*
Still, it's pretty entertaining.
Well, I know Zero and the Gurren Lagann gang
yup
02Did you know that you can just call customer support when DRM gives you problems and they'll fix it?
03no
03you can't.
dat music
i know it from somewhere
03LOL, go call Ubisoft and complain about their always-on DRM, I dare you
Eh.
I recognize about...half...of characters.
Oh yeah, Kallen!
2,14 on the stream
I like Kallen :3
/me cant describe it
03ys
03*yes
03but they didn't re-release those games
this bit'
03dude
03IF THEIR SERVERS GO DOWN
2,14 I'll use him first during my turn
03THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE
02derp
I don't recognise anything at all. But it's still pretty neat. I like the animation.
02then you just wait rather than never playing it?
I dunno
thanks Japan lol
6BlueFlare, you're missing a point though lol
03yeah
03that's not them fixing it at all
Ikr.
03uh
6but they're completely capable of having offline capabilities
i also never watched Eureka 7...
me neither
03or at least most of the time XD
suddenly anime
6minecraft is lesser of an example, but i use it because i never play single player
I haven't finished that one yet
6I only ever play on a sever
2,14 it only appears at the end of the show
6server
03well yeah
2,14 and in the shitty movie
03but you *can*
6that's my
03unlike TF2 which basically doesn't have a point in single player
I didn't really like Eureka 7...
6point.
6meh
03or WoW or something :P
6don't argue about it
6it was an example.
Amen.
03I wasn't, I was just saying
why are robots fucking
03carry on LOL
WOO
6anyways
-_-
2,14 basically:
2,14 all of the animes storylines weave into one
whats with all the ping timeouts
well goodnight everypony!
03and their servers have to not be overloaded
6I had to wait
see you all tomorow
03LOL
03well
i cant understand japanese/chinese/korean
03the whole idea is that I *don't* want to be giving my money to companies that are going to do that crap
You don't have to.
just watch/
03because then they just go
just watch and enjoy...
there are dozens of SRW games, and dozens of animes brought into each one apparently... good luck ever figuring it out!
03"Hey look, tons of people bought it! Let's keep it up"
:^3
robots with lazers
6I'm still now sure why Blizzard decided to set it up that way, but whatever
03um
03"people like me"?>
whoa....
6uh
03and in no way actually cared?
03-d
dat dodge
6I enjoy my games
6please remove that statement
03fine
That mech has daft feet.
... punch him in the face dont use a damned laser
6lol.
although i dont recognize that mecha...
03my point being
03Nothing is impossible to crack.
03It's been proven time and time again
6lets just all agree that we have different opinions here
YES
6it's not happening
0320 million dollars for 12 hours.
Japan
That one is way cooler.
:D
i like the song, its pretty smooth...
It's... nice.
but i dont recognize the anime its from
That barely hurt it
Those aren't lasers are they. They don't sound like lasers.
6thank you battlenet for giving me a code I can remember OTL
02You also have to worry about getting a $250,000 fine for something you could have spent $60 on
oh dear lord
suddenly wingmen
dat Macross
...
03first of all, that fine is for MOVIES, not games
02and they do like to hand pick people
03second of all, trolololololol9ol
03:P
Looks more like the old Harry Potter to me.
02that is
02XD
You're WRONG
The glasses, though
03not just kind-of
03the only people the RIAA has made examples of
03in the past couple years
you told me to tell you it doesnt
03er, MPAA rather
just once?
03yes
INTENSE STARE
http://www.johnlennon.com/wp-content/themes/jl/images/home-gallery/2.jpg
Also ;) is best pony
o/
03and they said his IP was downloading porn illegally
Night gola
03that's the whole point.
12*internet
Exactly.
/me hides
12lol
Celestia is best pony >:3
03due to my blindness
03sorry
yes rarity is best pony ^
6how'd you respond
xD
6anyways
03uh
Pinkie Pie is best pony.
6uh
03braille keyboard
i dont think lennon enjoys that
/me runs
12I'd be hard pressed to draw this well with no sight
6braile screens now?
6that should happen...
Huh? Twilight is best pony. My favorite is Rarity.
12lol
/me 6trololol
12actually
lies, Luna is best pony
02that would be cool XD
12good idea
03that would be pretty difficult to do
No.
12but how?
6that would be awful
dat Aquarion... and its moon pawnch
03because you'd have to have a way for the dots to retract when you scroll
03yeah
Dat groin punch
TO THE MOOOOOOOONN
Just kidding. :P
03text to speech is really the more ideal way
dayum
6^
Say hello to Luna for me!
MOOOOOON PPPPAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNCCCCHHHH
02yeah
6I was about to say that
6anyways
HUZZAH!
12mind readers
12all of you
THE RARITY FANS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED!
xD
From 1 to 2.
That was Celestia's mech right? :D
02either way, that still would be pretty neat
02XD
6but for the most part
I liek Celestia :3
i like Rarity... she just isnt my fav pony...
6I don't give a crap about things
03I basically relay it all through Germany :D
6I buy a lot too
/me runs
^_^
03well same here
03I actually have a quite large legal movie collection
6^
03and you should see how much I waste on Xbox Live
Eh. Rarity fans are just like diamonds.
03like the arcade games
xD
Rare.
Mazinger!
i can see it now... it takes 3 people to pilot Aquarion... Celestia, Luna and Cadance...
03if not, and it's not insanely expensive, I'll buy it
03Hogia|Animation
lol
6I pirated CS5 photoshop
03because it's insanely expensive
6legit
6so I was like sure
12fair enough
03for upgrading a CS4 to CS5
12lucky you
6but I have cracked CS3 After effects
03it was a legal copy too
damnit keyboard
12I have CS6.
6and cracked TV Paint
Lol
03honestly, when it comes to software, piracy is usually easier LOL
6and cracked Win7
In all honesty, the only pony I truly don't like is Trixie.
03since you don't have to deal with activation
anyone know how to fix the Enter key on a keyboard
02I payed like $300 for photoshop CS5
this things to damn easy to hit
6and cracked toon boom
02paid*
6uh, my friend
12I still like XP
03OK well LOL
6he basically handed his hard drive to me and was like "take whatever"
03so
one does not simply fix the Enter key...
03for those, it's easier to not try cracking XD
03XP is easy to crack
pfft, sure i do
6I don't even know why I have win7
03but it's hilariously easy enough to just abuse their phone activation
6I don't feel like I'm gonna upgrade tbh
03I've given the same Win7 key to like 20 people
03and it works fine
03XD
is that Gurren Lagan
Mostly because it doesn't mean anything.
lol
GIGA DRILL BREAKER!
I hate when people adore Trixie for her fanon when ponies like Celestia get crap for absolutely no good reason.
dis be some hawt porn
^^^^^^^
11,02Meanwhile: I see...Moo :>

/me retreats to his bridge
03I know

03I should
Whos talkin about trolls?
*CP

^
People need to think.
Dialogueeeeee
02:3
And way less harsh to Trixie than they should be ¬_¬
03LOL
LOL SORNY
Stupid tart that she is.
I KNOW RIGHT?!?!?!
lol
03it's fun
03and cheaper usually
13think
i wouldn't say it's fun,
13think think think
but it's def. cheaper
13i need a thinking spot
it's only cheaper if you don't break any of the parts during building
/me runs
6convenience
well, that too

03I actually *enjoy* building computers
03just like people enjoy working on their cars

canon>fanon :/
03I only build desktops...
lol really?
02I know
03as for laptops, I had mine custom made for me
And I'm fairly sure Danke schön is the equivalent of "thank you very much"
03but by a store
13the schoen is a modifier, essentially "very"
03It wouldn't be too hard to make a laptop if they actually sold empty laptop cases to the public :P
also
13as in good to look at
Oh yeah

A Satoshi Kon production
/me hides
03BlueFlare
03we played that on FM radio
03just to be silly
03:P
02XD
03one of our DJs prank called to request it
2,14 amazing how people DO something when you ask them to -_-
03so we pranked him back and actually played it
03he came running in like OMG WHY ARE YOU ACTUALLY PLAYING IT
voltron! finally a mech I recognize
03good times :P
02lol
03That's like the only fun I get to have around here
2,14 that's not voltron -_-
03is the radio station
I don't think that's Voltron...
POWAH
2,14 That's Godmars -_-
wat! gaah
03it's basically a club, except we have the added benefit of actually controlling a radio station too XD
Dodge.
PIKACHUUUUU
03also LOL age-restricted music videos
No, it's Jigglypuff >:I
03I'd totally play this song but it's a bit...suggestivce
03-c
03didn't you say they locked you out
03for a couple months
6no they haven't yet
03o
03*oh
03when does tha..oh
03OK
03which reminds me
6unless i want to pay the 50 bucks for blackout tickets
03I'm quite certain my family is going to do Disneyland
03so
03I should try to stage a picture for splash mountain or whatever
03ZXD
03*XD
Slurry appears to be having issues.
6you should
6that reminds me I should get my friend to upload that picture we took last time
3heheh
3heheh, yeah, I'm fine
Applejack is underrated.
I like Applejack's voice :3
02take a picture of the picture FTW
03no.
02XD
6uh
Such a nice lilt to her voice <3
6upload as in from his phone
02I hate it when people do that
6you'll see
I can't say that I have a least favorite of the mane 6...
03ah
03...LOL
6you can tell who's from california when they do that
03well
6since they dont' care to buy a souvenier

03yeah
03I'm sure we'll just buy it
And the .com seems fine as well.
13i
13hate
13comcast
13so much
/me dances on Shane377's head
lol^ ?
02once we did that
03see
02not as fun really
A cable company if I remember correctly.
03that reminds me of an awesome story from Cedar POint
03I had this camera, right
I use Telus
03it was just a $20 film camera
03not disposable though, a battery powered film one
Oic.
03well I had it in my pocket
comcast is like Virgin.
03I get off the roller coaster, and I'm like "holy crap my camera disappeared, did I lose it on the ride?"
13there are no other providers
Fanon is great for developing a background character's personality
/me dances on DeathStar's head
03So I go look at the in-ride photo
13our other options are dialup or satellite, which would be twice as expensive and a third as fast
13or reliable
03you see me, and my camera is just suspended in midair about a foot behind me
yeah... that sucks
03and bought the photo
same problem with telstra sometimes, they block other providers and charge 10x as much
Actually, I can't think of a particularly bad isp over here off the top of my head -_^

If not, be glad and don't go looking for it.
Oh hi.

Didn't know The Offspring were a bunch of girls
Oh right, I have tea waiting to be made. I shall abscond.
2,14 in one of the drawfriends
Well, then...
I like The Offsprings :$
That's certainly not appropriate.
04Shit's changed...the fandom's changed
04For the worse
2,14 huh?
I support the old fandom
even though I never experience it
Fair enough.
04Okay, listen
alright
Right, we all liked ponies.
I've been in this fandom for over a year but I've never considered the 'politics' of it. And looking at it that's probably a good thing.
hows going
Politics is never a good thing.
04Everybody was on equal ground
oi drf
http://www.mediafire.com/?5vb4nd9ej52zz9v
WTF collective. Score.
I outright ignore fandom politics. Any fandom, any media.
lol
WTF COLLECTIVE!
04We all came together to watch the show and that was it
:D
Does it feel like to anyone else that the fandom has kind of gained it's own cliques?
This must be WTF Collective 1.

04Eh, I prefer to look at as "We do this for fun because it's fun"
i misunderestimated the length ┐(￣ー￣)┌
2,14 yeah...we just stream shit
04^
03how long are the actual vocals?
anyway, thats the whole piano song
there are vocals in the middle 6 minuites of the song?
I like this place, it's just a fun place to enjoy ponies and poke fun at each other :(
Fandom acting dumb
I have fun here because people are friendly.
>tropes
It's not my joke
03I thought SHout was only a 4 minute song

13hope it's just yycast being fail
Stream cut out.
13back up
Aye.
cya
Bye bye :D
D:
13watching the fmle output... has audiosurf always looked that terrible on stream...
i know
Like family photes and things you can't replace?
photos*
it could be a hard job
But it's still lagging and freezing a lot.
^
Then it all worked out for the bets. :)
best*
13yeah seeing that here...
Yep. dat gambling. :D
13fmle is lying through its teeth saying i'm getting solid 30fps out...
03well
03that starts with "let it all out"
03oh hm
03I could take the "Shout, shout" part from DJH, eh?
/me curses Ninjazz's fingers
Najizz i could break em for ya.
Lol Najizz
:O
Aw.
I'm not awesome!
This'll do?

Still going
I still don't see it. I just come on here type words. How does that make me awesome? :$
13lol that's even worse...
Yup.
13why does it keep falling behind...
I think whatever's up it's probably YYcast.
13restarted
13to which the answer is no..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Cs5pa7Tfk
13encoder is falling way behind
Well its 03:15, i should get ready to sleep. I'm still here though
13far far worse than usual i'm sure...
I dare you.
Yeah. Back on April First. I don't think they are making any plans though.
8,1# LOOOOOVE'S IIN BLOOOOOM #
ARGH!

Oh hi, Saturn.
hi Saturn
Hey, Saturn... Singing mood?
8,1hullo, everypony!
Streams off.
hi Saturn
8,12 pairs of my friends are getting married!
13up again
Hey Saturn!
8,1*2 pairs
8,1woah, my colourscript fucked up...
not on the sameday hopefully
Congratulations, Saturn!
Good for them Saturn!
Still off.
Well, for them, anyway.
08,01there, fixed it.
03darn it, that doesn't work either
03well
02[The current time where I live is 0305:17:3102 on 03Friday, 05/18/201202. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
03but I'll fix it up later
There we go.
/me 08,01wants to get married and spawn
Oh, thank you.
Marriage is for silly fillies.
/me throws cider at Saturn
08,01unfortunately, the kind of marriage i'd want isn't legal in this country
08,01:(
oh my
>_>
poor Saturn
:(
Saturn: I'm not sure if I follow, but if I do, come on over to Denmark where everyone can get married in the church.
Sorry to hear that, Saturn.
13yeah but i'm getting framerate drops in audiosurf
13that's very bad
08,01as the state neither recognises gay marriage, nor polyamorous marriage
Saturn: you'd like two women? :P
08,01MaidSurge: or a man and a woman, or two men, or more...
08,01Ninjazz: aye
All in agreement?
08,01yup
You bi Saturn? :O
08,01i am, yes
03oh hey I think I got it
dunno*
lol
oh
my
More power to you then! I have already two bi female friends :D
hehe
You worry me, Saturn. :D
It's not lagging as much, but the freeze is still up in full.
08,01hey, i'm just an old fashioned romantic who's discovered non-determinicity!
Saturn: you're saying you'll consider an animal?
Saturn: Wait, do you live in America?
13sigh..
13and asuka's overheating i know it
Scotland.
08,01Kammerjunk: scotland, aye
08,01Pinkies4thWall|stuff: only changelings and rarity.
DAT RARITY
You want to let it cool down for a bit?
13she doesn't cool down anymore
13there's no ventilation at all
:/
I'm partial to Twi' myself. Maybe it's because I can't stop reading, I dunno.
;)
I still won't consider the idea of humanized
Ok.
Why not? They basically are humans in pony bodies.
I'd sleep with a pony, but wouldn't do one. ponies are sacred
08,01it takes away the magic
^
i know right
do it!!!
but its SOOO good
It's a-okay!
/me pokerface
08,01goddamn.
That sweater
that looks ok Saturn
tis hawt
INB4 wetmane Chry- wait...
hot, but ok
13http://mips.tv/shizutest
She has like a constant wet mane.
Also those undies O__O
03can I soundcloud this?
Don't take this the wrong way, but I would prefer it if she didn't have the underwear.
Hey everypony i'm back what's going on? *clicks in the Saturn's link* ಠ_ಠ
ispz
But yeah, that picture is hardly wrong. Just look at Wrek's R63 of the mods.
^eenope
lol, nice
^
13phase says audio is slightly behind
I'll wait for dialogue to comment on the audio.
13yeah
08,01hahaha
08,01<3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QCeIp88wEw
Yeah he's right. Just a little.
iv not heard anything from my parnets
need to go for an while hope to see you soon guys! :)
Oh
AHHH!
03http://soundcloud.com/drfsupercenter/shout-vs-pjanoo
Makes sense.
03but there's that
08,01Chrysalis: well, it's coming from America
It's not lagged once though.
08,01so it may take a while
why are you ordering things for me from america!
I have no stream... just me? Oh please say it isnt just me
I'd rather slightly off synch audio than watching it progress 1 frame every thirty seconds.
You have a beautiful heart, Saturn.
08,01because it was cheaper to do that than to order it from over here, bizarrely
man, this is gonna take more explaining to my parents
02drf
i'm not gonna get away with "my friend ordered it for me" am i
03anyway
03it's 5:30 am
Oh. OH!
They didn't mind.
I found a hilarious thread
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/show/res/36356219.html#36367186

13NOW it's switched
Hey how do you reserve names?

Scroll to the bottom, where it's the good part
I might need a close up of someones face while they talk.
13yeah that won't be for a couple scenes i think
13oh here we go
Typical that now Grievous shows up.
08,01right, i think i'll stream
where can i get cheap MS points
It might be out by like, half a second
But that could just be because I'm staring.
13yeah
08,01right, should be going now
yep
13"no miswired jokes"
Just got here, what's it streaming?
Pfft.

bye scoota-chicken
:)
It's 8:12 am BST. BST = Eastern Time.
And other clestia has two names
Is this the First Act?
DOnt know wat moelstia is dont check
.....
BORING
I'm pretty sure this is Act 2
Whatever
i havent played any of them,i just think RPGs are stupid
I adore a good RPG. :p
Eh, if it's not ofna01's genre, that's fair enough.
only RPG i like is Skyrim
Though asking for clarification is fair. :P
RPG's are too much of a grind for me.
And you like Skyrim?
Understanable.
:P
Then there's that...
That one is, in fairness, pretty grindy.
Looks fun
Tedious doesn't equate to stupid in my mind, but to each his own. =/
But still, i find most of Hack n' Slashers boring
Hard to foucus on the charecter some times though
Look, portals!
*an
Probably normal.
Given that the templar's lvl 21.
But of course
But I'm gonna say 'normal'. :P
:d
Youdontsay.jpg
I was pointing out how all BLizzard games have the same feel
GN
There's a few decent hack and slashers out there still.
lol Tetris XD
:)
All blizzard games are 3rd person,all hae the same camera angle, and most of the charecters are very weird.
Or just complex
I'm inclined to disagree with the camera angle. :P
^me too
(For example)
You can change it but the camera angle starts out the same in most of them, like Starcraft 2
StarCraft has a top-down camera, but with zoom and turn capability.
Well, all of Blizzard's single-player games have this isometric camera angle
They just look the same to me
Nice looking lighting! :O
A hack and slasher like this would be a lot more confusing in first person.
wow as an fps
Of course
And I can't imagine an RTS viewed any way other than top-down. :p
Yes it would
It's a good camera angle for the kind of games they use it in.
I dont like games like this because of there camera angles and how easy it is too die in most of there games.
^
:D
lol
I've played Heroes of Might & Magic, but that's hardly the same thing. =P
Nothing. I don't have school.
Blizzard didn't make LoL.
StarCraft 2 is really good.
BAD
Is that one 3rd person?
?
I thought GoW was an FPS?
Yes
Thats entirely opinion.
vanquish wasnt made by blizzard
It is an FPS 3rd person
Not me
I dont like the feel
fps 3rd person.....*brainexplode*
Okay.
and WAY too long of a story line
How is it FPS (first person shooter) if it's Third Person?
I've never really gone in for shooters anyway. They need to have either a phenomenal story or not take themselves seriously at all.
It is a TPS
Doesn't that make it a Third Person Shooter?
Yeah
a Third person shooter
But it is still OK but I dont like it
=P
Eh. The shooter genre is over saturated anyway.
^
I'm not going to say it's bad, because it isn't. It's just not my thing.
First FPS of its kind
Skyrim merely updated and upgraded the formula.
I dont know any other FPS games with only swords other than the other Elder Scrolls.
Magic does not count
as a gun
bai gotta go 2 school
This has been ever since Daggerfall.
That's why it's not exactly an FPS. I'm inclined to call it an FPRPG.
Skyrim was far from first.
lots and lots of games before it (at least the elder scroll serires) were simiklar
bai everybody
Bai
Might & Magic did something similar, come to that.
^
Never heard of it,any good?
lol
It's actually pretty good, I've heard. It got bogged down by bad reviews because of the problems people had playing it when it first came out.
^marketing
ah////doubt it

Goodjob Saturn
nice Saturn
It is
"Secret of my Excess" is showing now on The Hub.
The game's pretty good. The story's an atrocity.
lol

IV was a pain to play
Sadly, it's not, with poor voice acting and similar. :P
best one to start with
huzzah!
Caravans were clever, the no-hero-armies were genius, I loved the hero partaking in the combat system...
and there were tons of them*_*
Sadly, the balance was shit, towns limited, and many things seemed unfinished.
^
We beat the crap out of computer players together
Like I said, I consider the story to be bad, but the gameplay is very solid now.
Necropolis is my beloved city in the series<3
I'm inclined to say that the name's not going to make a return.
My first time playing I played as knights, but ALL the factions' cities are gorgeous to look at. :3
They already showed the "fixed" episode before.
She is not coming back.
At least the Academy can go 'yeah, mages. We can teleport. Now shush.' :P
а вам что:S
yep
а ты кто:|
Blegh.
Fine. But I'm telling you, as in the 8-bit commercial, It could happen.
Mind you, there's a LOT to dislike in heroes VI, right up to and including it being a horrendous bug-fest, but still. :P
а я лера:S
Heh. 1337 o'clock. :)
Dat Leet.
aww i only got 10:37 :(
Put it this way: They have that always-online tripe, right?
They do?
Tech Support had buggered off for the weekend.
This story again. :D
Am I that repetitive?
No.
Phew.
I just remember the first time you told me it. :)
нечево не мешно:[
Blue LOOT!
UbiSoft's not seeing my money until they provide similar service or finally get rid of their always-online atrocity.
Yeah, that's one thing I don't like about StarCraft 2. The fact that you HAVE to be online to play it, even if you're just doing the single-player campaign. =/
heh
dont*
Exactly.
It's more aggravating if the servers die on the company's end. You're fine, but you still can't play.
пока:S
Again, why I don't mind Blizzard's using it as much as UbiSoft - Blizzard usually provides solid servers, as opposed to UbiSoft.
Valve needs to prove it can count to 3. =P

I am wondering how we aren't freaking about this more than we should.
I thought the upheaval was because people couldnt play online...
You know, requiring online-only gameplay is an effective anti-piracy mechanism. They might not be willing to give that up unless they can be sure that they can get more sales by allowing offline play.
You can get kicked forom single player for having a higher ping or for idling
Well, only thing that might "help" against would most likely be people who're hacking their way to the top..
