didn't like it-
i wouldve disliked it, but hearing about it every day several times for the last month makes me hate it
I like Gangnam Style.
but meme's and replication has never been my humour, so- whatever
i like the idea of gangam, but i hate that its promoting pop music like never before
or feels anything, gangman just feels like a joke, and I don't really like joke music
saw half of it yeah, I think it's just for giggles
I mean, that was hilarious.
!ping
pop music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTtki7hXC64
gangnam style is good
Shit
I don't really like jokes in music, some eh exceptions, but I can't remember them at the moment
Throw it on the ground! That was the exception
its good but i dont like how everyone makes parodies of it every fucking day
should i get resident evil 4 on the PSN yes or no?
But it actually has a pretty srs message.
The song does.
Yeah, those things are okay
should i buy Resident Evil 4?
I don't really listen to foo fighters, but as long as the song feels good or gives feels
well it is on the PSN
bye guys
Of course, not against people doing it, but you know discussing taste is talking, I guess
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEg0TxK-jfM
the reason i hate gangam is mostly because it promotes pop, even if it intended to parody it
all it did was cement the position of pop above other music
Maaybe- I don't think it matters
it was a parody of mostly korean things, including korean pop
Aah
but now that its become a hit
Gangnam style is good
its shit.
I can't even remember it
the idea is good, but the music is shit
I like you know some pop music, mostly in the sub pop genre
wouldn't be the first parody to become a hit
i define pop as a genre, not just popular
it always involves a simple beat,
well it is a genre, but that genre changes slowly
scientists showed that the current pop is the simplest form of pop of all time
barely any note variety
probably, danceable requires simple beat
music doesnt always have to be dancable
of course
simplicity
i know
you have minimalism, which is even simpler than pop, but is not popular
*under it
well I kinda disagree there
mainly because musicians thrive under and away from pop, removing it would probably--not be a good thing
they dont thrive that much
they dont have nearly as much money
Hey
Enough to create music
of course, but removing pop would not give the mmoney
well, many
mainly because I like messing around in local bands and underground shit
oh you mean solo singers?
well not solo, but singers of music which is focused on voice
A few, I guess
I found more TimeTurners!
point is that pop is certainly getting in the way of other music getting the rewards it deserves, as well as thriving
yeah its not Preventing it, but its in the way
in an artificial way
Turned out they made like six
pop listeners are casual or radio listeners, and such
easy listening
maybe- but I dunno, I don't think it's hard to find nonpop
idk, mostly i hear pop on the radio
just on the radio I hear crazy shit I've never heard of
well yeh vevo only advertises their biggest artists
i use related, but tid oesnt help
*it doesnt
good radio
Resident Evil 4 is 3333 MB to download haha
>Jazz
I liike jazz
and noise-
hm, ill need to check that out
jazz is meh
I like some country, not all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZHwyc26kyk trondheim jazz orchestra
00,02hmmm
have to see them sometime
Just seems to me like if you do country you don't have MUCH talent.
00,02looks like the uk government dont like our webhost
Awwww poor diddum pommies.

Do they need a tissue?
/me likes H.U.V.A. Network
00,02https://twitter.com/nfsn/status/254225205298335744
Best way to find uncommon music is to search for it specifically, sadly
At the current rate they get like 30 cents for each album I think
Or each song played
We had classes in school about royalties, licenses, contracts and such
can't remember anything-
and it differs from country to country
00,02gnight

Night
living wihtout a label is a ton of extra work, but some bands prefer it
some bands don't
he-hello
I'd prefer a label, cause theres soo much crap to do
If we left behind Record Labels I guarentee crappy singers won't get any more attention
And then got more popular off of a label
Well, off of Usher getting him to a label
damnit
the whole money thing is complicated, and many use a label to--not mess up
derp
Cool

And all those times Celestia did jack all to help

I have a intense hatred/dislike for Celestia, because she never fucking does anything
:D
since that isnt canon in equestria since its a dictatorship
technically its a theocracy
*whispers* it's a cartoon, don't overthink it...
Also ^^^^^^
youre right.... she once ordered some guards around

it is fun
lets walk into another theme.... magic in nonpegasi....
yes...
the portals and porting and spawning of items and foretelling of immediate reactions....in other words: pinkie pie
i know
me?
xD
was it 23?
its 20
season 2 episode 20
just looked
While earth ponies moves trains all day all night
damn 3 episodes off
yeah .... where do the portals come from?
Doesnt matter
MAGIC! I aint gotta explain shit.
If APplejack can use her earth pony strength RD should be allowed to use her wings
she has a portalgun
na you get them on level 50... shes 44...
she cant have it
hi everypony :)
They never really explain why Cerberus left his post
that sure is an interesting comic
hi
or he stepped in one of pinkys portals
since they are stashed all over equestria
He's supposed to guard Tarterus...WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
humans in Equestria!
:)
inb4 balls
Hi guize!
this happening would have been mostly be caused by a prisoner from the prison
Oh boy, I hope my picks win for next Movie Night
he most likely would have left
BUUUUUTTTTT
he didnt
hi
So..Ponyville is.. STATIONED NEAR A PRISON FOR EVIL
hope my picks wins too
would fit into the timeline
oh, nmv
The fuck was Celestia thinking when they gave those settlers that land?!
I voted for Vertigo and Saw
OH SHIT!
they should be imprisoned in tartaurs...

eeeeh
Anyone play Metroid Prime 3?
Back
no one dies
not even granny smith
I haven't even played Metroid Prime 1 or 2.
:3
Correct me if I'm wrong but did Celestia put Discord's statue back where it was before?
wasnt shown spade
I don't even know that Metroid Prime exist
maybe the coffin was empty
and gods are immortal
Well the seal would have broke eventualy
They could have banished him to the moon or sun or something
Maybe they could take Discord's Statue and bury it
to the moon!
we dont know if the princesses are immortal or eternal
there is a difference
i most likely think the princesses are eternal
hi
Also the fact one tiny argument set him free seems stupid
is this FPS starcraft?
Maybe the seal was about to break anyway
i wouldnt call it ceal
seal
i would call it "sleep"
...Fifteen minutes later she just nukes humanity and moves on
no metroid fans I see :P
Juvie?
And how would Celestia get there powers?
Eat there hearts or something?
if twilight wouldve failed....
Doubt there's juvie in Equestria.
having a juvie in equestria is like having a jail in Tazmily village, there would be no use
oh
k
:3
how do people get to stream?
i play L4D 2 a lot :)
i played l4d2 alot too
have about 300 hrs in it
I'm actually rather aware of the Metroid series because my younger brother is into it.
hello everypony!
Also Discords personality caused his downfall
night
And that caused him to lose
sonics cool
GOTTA SPEED KEED
brb
k
yeah gotta go fast!
gotta go real fast!
thats no good!
Gotta Buzz Cuzz
way past cool!
Think about it, if you just took over the world without any opposition, that would be boring right?
WAZZAAAAA
I did find Granny dancing amusing
dragonesque...
Nice!
movie night in 2h eh?
*not
good evening
hey angel is no douchebag.... hes just a little spoiled
Planetside 2.
ooohhh.... i made many enemys with that statement
they cant
I'm fine
keep in mind
angel is a douche, hes not spoiled. he cares for fluttershy though
:)
I think angel is mean because he tries to get Fluttershy to toughen up
Just my theroy
*theory

And apperently Changling were able to fill the entire room in the finale...

THATS IT
o_o
._.
:D :D :D DOHOHOHOH Scoots~
I'm still not gonna be satisfied untill Celestia gives a apology to Twilight for doubting her
wait wait wait wait
celestia and luna are princesses
they are no "gods"

I have never ever used or even seen a spork irl.
you just said that you wanted to get kicked
they have sporks at taco bell.
SPORKS ARE THE FUTURE
mmhmm
hi
Yes :3
Aint he cute? o///o
i imagined him to be a little gothy, xD
Sporks are the most exotic inventions of all of ponykind
thus he was kicked
or do the eat everything with they magnethooves?
He...doesnt act goth o_o
Wut.

0,5Hello there guys
Go kick an appletree as hard as you can!
*magic*
>implying humans are strong enough
AND IF THEY AREN'T RAINBOW YOU FAILED
They should make Zap apple cider
ji
SHIT JUST GOT REAL spade
:O I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
the thing is
/me steals Michael's favor
Hello Everpony :)
Maaaaaaagic
hi
i dont think they would be able to produce the alcoholic percentage for the cider
wat grm irs tis?
since they disapear after 1 day
man, everyone is saying hai today
they dont have a aging process that diverses the fruit into a stinkin pile of mold
I doubt cider is alcoholic in the pony world
I just figured out where to start looking for a park job - Galveston! :)
with alcohol as a sideeffect
"these arent like normal apples"
hi
/me breaks out of prison
I could essentually stay there with minor expenses
I have no idea, do I look like I know how pony cider works?
the thing is.... if they already have a process tha destinates their existence (the plop after a day) means they dont have a second one
wb
I`m eating spagehtti
means they dont need to be able to mold
grouphug!
a jar of zapapple-jam... could be as eternal and immortal as celestia
:O
all the welcome backs :3
glad to be back XD
You left?
we should get the zap apple jam to make a coup and take the power
guys
Androirc doesn't like anybody :p
Yes/

yeah?

Is that accent natural or just something she does?
hello
Well i mean the accent
I think most of the bikers on those weekends hang out on the northside of the island - and along the seawall - few travel south to the park
my money is that season 3 is going to premire on the 30th of November
Or somethin like that. I don't remember
Crazy bastard mode

Chocolate milk of glass
daww Jack just jumped on my lap :3
It's working fine for me
Thats why he killed ya.
I think it's her wifi
Is it confirmed Applejack's parents are deceased?
:o
heyo all
Yeah, it probably is
:)
We have yet to see Fluttershy's parents or Rd's
I guess it's the wifi that doesn't like her then.
Those would be interesting episodes
lol
are AJ's parents even mentioned in the series?
The future, we know nothing about balistics.
That would be awesome.
Hahaha.
That wont be for awhile
In the future there are no ponies. T_T
nop!
All good things have an end
everything has an end.
You, everthing around you, everything beyond you.
ANd that too
*make
hi
hi
well i just recently read a fanfic where applebloom got a "sledgehammer" cutymark... because her talent was to be a sledgehammer for a very very angry marine
I really don't know if she can do the crack now
I feel sorry for Luna sometimes
False, you're a bellend and no one cares.
For?
She could re do the voice she had but the voice crack was unintentional
oh grats, you spelled it right this time
*resisting the urge to throw in the word that picollo says to gohan in DBZTAS*
DOOOOOOOOOODGE
the other one
Neeeerd
yeah xD
Sooo yeah it would sound force in my opinion if she tries
>Your sister has been on the moon for 1000 years, don't bother education her on the changes
lol
Progress is best Luna fic
Has Progress updated at all?
No idea
IDK, Luna's doing pretty well when it comes to VIDYA GAMES
What's the guy's name on first base?
