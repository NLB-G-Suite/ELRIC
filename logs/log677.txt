>see gangnam style
>refer to http://cs309323.userapi.com/v309323180/1609/BErKYZDf-9I.jpg
I saw half gangnam style music video
didn't like it-
i wouldve disliked it, but hearing about it every day several times for the last month makes me hate it
I like Gangnam Style.
I just don't get the humour in reiterating a music video in various ways
/me throws Ninjazz into a a volcano
but meme's and replication has never been my humour, so- whatever
Since it's a better alternative to all the rap and hippy hop music that's ALWAYS blasted here usually.
/me was the Ring of Power.
i like the idea of gangam, but i hate that its promoting pop music like never before
I don't listen to music on bronystate
I like pop, indiepop, hell I like almost everythign as long as it's honest and feels good to me
or feels anything, gangman just feels like a joke, and I don't really like joke music
If you've seen the music video, it probably is.
saw half of it yeah, I think it's just for giggles
Especially since he yells at a woman's ass.
i like joke music, and i wouldve liked gangnam, if it werent so popular because of its simplicity. all its doing is promoting pop music
I mean, that was hilarious.
I don't mind it, obviously, but I don't like it or jokes based on it
!ping
pop music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTtki7hXC64
gangnam style is good
Shit
I don't really like jokes in music, some eh exceptions, but I can't remember them at the moment
Throw it on the ground! That was the exception
its good but i dont like how everyone makes parodies of it every fucking day
should i get resident evil 4 on the PSN yes or no?
Walk by the Foo Fighters has a joke music video.
But it actually has a pretty srs message.
The song does.
Yeah, those things are okay
should i buy Resident Evil 4?
I don't really listen to foo fighters, but as long as the song feels good or gives feels
Sith, yes.
well it is on the PSN
bye guys
so i will bet it
night alexxm
Bya alexxm
Yeah Parodies aren't quite my style, I'm not a fan of replication-
Of course, not against people doing it, but you know discussing taste is talking, I guess
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEg0TxK-jfM
the reason i hate gangam is mostly because it promotes pop, even if it intended to parody it
all it did was cement the position of pop above other music
Maaybe- I don't think it matters
I don't think it was a parody either, not sure what kind of group they are
it was a parody of mostly korean things, including korean pop
Aah
but now that its become a hit
Gangnam style is good
its shit.
I can't even remember it
the idea is good, but the music is shit
but- pop is popular music, it will always be, what that includes will change-
wouldn't be the first parody to become a hit
i define pop as a genre, not just popular
it always involves a simple beat,
well it is a genre, but that genre changes slowly
a simple melody
just how rock technically died out in the 50s
but we still call things rock
scientists showed that the current pop is the simplest form of pop of all time
barely any note variety
probably, danceable requires simple beat
and 5 note melodies are usualyl the easiest to remember, being better for pop
music doesnt always have to be dancable
of course
but that is what pop aims for
simplicity
i know
thats what im saying
you have minimalism, which is even simpler than pop, but is not popular
and im sick of it corporate pop crushing all other forms of music on it
*under it
well I kinda disagree there
mainly because musicians thrive under and away from pop, removing it would probably--not be a good thing
they dont thrive that much
they dont have nearly as much money
Hey
Enough to create music
of course, but removing pop would not give the mmoney
and young and upcoming artists that arent into pop dont get the chance to be big
if you don't strive to be big, that doesn't matter
it does, how many non-pop singers can you name out of the top of your head?
well, many
i can only name one who i accidentally saw
mainly because I like messing around in local bands and underground shit
oh you mean solo singers?
Don't listen to that, so wouldn't know
well not solo, but singers of music which is focused on voice
A few, I guess
I found more TimeTurners!
point is that pop is certainly getting in the way of other music getting the rewards it deserves, as well as thriving
I don't think so
I went looking through the episodes because I saw a rumor that they made even more Doctor Who ponies.
/me pokes the chat
yeah its not Preventing it, but its in the way
if you remove pop nothin will replace it
in an artificial way
Turned out they made like six
it will be replaced by every other type of music
but why would people who only listen to pop suddenly listen to somethign else?
all the freed up space will be enough for many types of music
pop listeners are casual or radio listeners, and such
easy listening
on radio in many countries you get tons of indie artists, unknown singers and artists, groups and such, going big is HARD, going is not
like i said, nowadays its not easy to hear music besides pop on the radio, or on youtube, just randomly. so if there were other music it might turn out they like it
maybe- but I dunno, I don't think it's hard to find nonpop
idk, mostly i hear pop on the radio
just on the radio I hear crazy shit I've never heard of
and on youtube, pop ads everywhere
well yeh vevo only advertises their biggest artists
but when going on youtube to discover music, do you use ads or related?
I pity those who go on Youtube for music.
idk, maybe im doing something wrong, but im mostly into instrumental/classical/vocal, and its not easy for me to randomly find music i like
I do it many times, cause many young bands put their stuff there, and live music
i use related, but tid oesnt help
Its like trying to navigate through space when all the stars are gone with a flashlight
*it doesnt
no- I see your problem there, it's not easy to stumble upon unless you have al ocal radio that specializes in it or--know channels like pandora
RainbowEthan, thaat's true, youtube isn't the best place for findign stuff
pandora, ive heard that before, i forget what it is
radio here plays jazz, classical, metal, pop and indie stuff
good radio
it's a radio that generates a playlist based on what you write in as your favourite artists
Resident Evil 4 is 3333 MB to download haha
>Jazz
I know, Vivix. I use Rhapsody.
Indeed.
I liike jazz
and noise-
Its not the best but it has pretty much all the major artists.
hm, ill need to check that out
im not into jazz, but its good music
Im open to all music except country
jazz is meh
I like some country, not all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZHwyc26kyk trondheim jazz orchestra
00,02hmmm
have to see them sometime
Just seems to me like if you do country you don't have MUCH talent.
00,02looks like the uk government dont like our webhost
but pandora isnt as popular as other sites like youtube, and i almost never stumble upon classical/rchestral there
Awwww poor diddum pommies.
Hehe, that may be true
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_qGa4N2CY chat needs more Phoenix Wright OST
<3
Do they need a tissue?
Phase4: why not?
/me likes H.U.V.A. Network
twilight_sprinkle, it's true, but I don't think removing anything would help us there
00,02https://twitter.com/nfsn/status/254225205298335744
In your river of tears
And she TOOK THE DOG.
Best way to find uncommon music is to search for it specifically, sadly
I wish the artists left Sony and all their records
Vivix: it would redirect the advertising business to other types of music, and that would give more variety, thats why it would help imo
And just sold their stuff independantly
At the current rate they get like 30 cents for each album I think
true, but I don't know how effecitve that could be in a nonspecific place
Or each song played
We had classes in school about royalties, licenses, contracts and such
can't remember anything-
and it differs from country to country
00,02and then i went to bed
00,02gnight

Night Phase
Night Phase4
Night Phase4!
Night
the thing with playing for a big time label is that you can get a steady pay, even if your royalties is low
night Phase4
Nacht Phase4.
but once you're out, you only got your royalties
Vivix if we left behind Record labels we could have Conventions for music
living wihtout a label is a ton of extra work, but some bands prefer it
some bands don't
he-hello
I'd prefer a label, cause theres soo much crap to do
If we left behind Record Labels I guarentee crappy singers won't get any more attention
TV and Youtube
But what if the Radio stations directly paid the Artists
Bieber comes from youtube guys
hallo everypony im back o.o
And then got more popular off of a label
well RainbowEthan they kinda do that now in some situations if you are on the royaltie
Well, off of Usher getting him to a label
damnit
the whole money thing is complicated, and many use a label to--not mess up
But what if the singers and bands dropped labels and a convention was started. Something like Music Independant Festival or something
i love phoenix wright
Hey LightTrooper105
They could sell Albums on their own websites and stuff
my leg still hurts i dont think i can run another mile or so
I see your point
hallo ASoftFluffyThing
It's a bit complicated and it depends on the label, you can go to a label that only manages your booking and helps you pay for studio time, or you can get a label that gives you producers and manages advertisement, booking, demands demos
derp
Cool
the more the label does for you, the more money they take from your sales
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349445868763.jpg
Ah.
one weekend in studio can cost as much as 5 000 dollar-
sandwich
Is that link NSFW Brony?
>.>
no
Cuz I'm at work.
I know a guy who spent around 100 000 dollars on an album the label rejected
know of*
That is INSANE.
RainbowEthan: if i linked NSFW i would be banned
yeaah, he told us he ckept the record in a safe, to remind himself of his mistakes
Oh yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o7YzPEtJkk
:D Protection!
bye
Wow Vivix
That is seriously crazyy
yeaah-
he was making a blues rock album in LA, but by the time he finished the label had decided that--blues rock was over in USA, and refused it
How long did the album take to make?
so he came back to norway a poor man, now he makes music for MTV and plays in a band that does relatively well
Vivix: see whar pop does though
well, in some cases yeah
but that's just how marketing is I guess-
had he had a contract before he made the record, they would have to put it out, so he did mess up
Smith that picture was disturbing XD
I thought it was NSFW at first.
RainbowEthan: its sith
not smith
SITH
I call you SITH NOW
Bronysith, my man! Fancy a game of Breakout with a maiden as the paddle? :D
MY RULES.
bronysmith
it is canon
yfw you called him correctly.
^
/me locks twilight_sprinkle in a room with molestia
Hehehe
Oh god...
http://youtu.be/XQ6sLAcA84Y heres the guy who lost so much money
Bronysith: i would drag you into here, but i know thats what you want
yup

Hi VenHur
STOP STABBING!

RainbowEthan: /me likes twilight
IT HUURTTTS!
T~T
Lies. It does not work, you liarponys.
whaat, what client are you on?
Man you guys are jerks.
lol
Just tell him the truth, jeez.
fiiiine
>.> Thank you Jmo.
;__;
Ninjazz: but hey, there ARE girls out there that act like hams just for fun :D so not all is lost
The law has been laid down. Zing.
MadSurge, eeeehhh. Still probably won't match Rarity. :3
... T~T
I like Rarity
... Someone kill Sprinkle XD
Vivix, ME TOO!
I like her snootyness
Some imagination yuo have there.
you*
Now tell me. Now. Before I get angry and go on 4chan.
... I love you so much 4Chan...
RainbowEthan: defeating a food topping, only makes it tastier!
Seriously it shuld be /me, I don't know any other way on IRC
Oh the horror if that happens. How will we do without you.
Lolwut
are you on the webclient?
Not working for me..
It IS /me.
Not working for me.
use /me action
Unless you're using colloquey or something.
Where are you signed in from?
Then it might be ACTION
Ninjazz: but I saw people acting like 'Shy and Pinkie :D I myself am quite chatty once I loosen up
Eh, if it doesn't work then fine
I can live without it.
Or can you.
... Oh god.... ...
Don't mention the poisoned doughnuts
I'm shaking...
JMO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE.
Sup.
Dying.
U?
MadSurge, well, it's easy to act like Flutters and Pinkie. Just act well... shy and act hyper active. Rarity... you need to be likeable while still having that posh, "I have standard" feel.
He put LAXATIVE in the donuts!
Why, JMO?
Cause I can.
Oh god blurhgbluurghghbutMYBUTTblurghgkbhugh
CURSE YOU JAAYMOOOOO
Ninjazz yees, she has that..she's not completely unbareable, while still having htat edge
Love you all <3
O u jaymoo.
Mah head hurts
Vivix, I LOVE her. Her voice started it all for me.
yeaah, I love her voice too-
my top three are actually Rarity, Fluttershy and Pinkie
Ninjazz: same for RD :D not all tomboys are really into it like her, Applejack's is a more common attitude :P
Dunno why I like Rarity so much, but- yeah
yeah
Oh trust me, I know the feel.
Vivix: you mean after twilight!
noo sorry ;__; but I still like her a lot too
aw fine
My top three are RainbowDash, Pinkie, and TimeTurner, even though he has nothing to do with the Mane Six.
Hehe
my list is 1.some purple horse 2. rarity 3. trixie 3.9 woona 4.everypone else 5. fluttershy
I like RD's eh progress?
Stop staring at me creepily Vivix
And pull your pants up >.>
No, it's the way of my people
MadSurge, Applejack is hardworking. Also, just because she never lies doesn't mean that she doesn't hide the truth. RD... hmmm. well, I'm on the fence of whether just acting a bit too bold and "I'm the topic of conversation" to pin point what her personality.
/me strokes RainbowEthan
Fear him.
... Why are you touching me?
... Help... Someone...
RD is insecure, which makes her a bit brash, but she's also impatient, but you know in hurrican episode you see her pull in her temper and try to understand Fshy
o_o
Don't question.
shows she's clearly developed since dragon mountain episode
jaymoo
waht r u doin
Just embrace.
stahp
jamew?
STAHP TWILIGHT
jaymoo
stahp
/me strokes Jaymo and RainbowEthan
... Jazz... Your pants are down
.... Help... Me....
0///0
twilight... Help...
I assume you're referring to me?...
screw you, im outta here!
/me abandons thread
/me is now in whitespace
I like how despite cutiemark and element, they are still ponies with emotions, and don't stick by their marks and elements so much that it becomes unrealstic
Ninjazz: I shuffle between perfect poker face and her pathetic attempts to hide the truth when I try to lie :D
it's just their trait
MadSurge, I don't hide it. I go FULL ON "I'M LYING!" mode when I lie. Unless, I /really/ need to lie. >_<
Kinda like sarcasm, but less caustic. :D
I suck at lying
I get like <,< ..totally not >.> a lie or anything <,<
You're good at touching people though.
That I am
People are soo soooft Jaymo, SOFT
"I'm not touching you. >.> <.<"
Vivix: well, no person is really one sided, nor are these ponies :D
SO VERY SOFT
"I'm stroking you."
yeah, and I like that MadSurge, it makes me like them more
Oh Jazz, perfect avoiding the truth thing
Horses are soft too, like a warm velvet rug
Sorry, had to get another chair.
LOL
Mine broke. Had it for three years XD
Getting too excited.
Tsk tsk.
I have like three office chairs just lying around in my office
I blame Vivix.
I'm still assuming I'm being referred to as Jazz?...
I broke the chair in my room in college, and by the end of the year you have to take eh inventory, to not pay for damages, and me and my friends stole a chair we found outside, and hid the remains of mine
I used to have other people inside my office, too.
Ninjazz, yeaah, all buddylike
Ahhh good. :3
What are people?
Miserable piles of friendship, jaymoo.
Miserable Piles of Friendship. Miserable
Ooooo.
Friendship and Sex
that's life, ooo, that's what all the people say
One big, bubbling, oozing pile of Friendship and sex.
And that is how life is made
hm..it actually IS how life is made
Well at least everybody stopped stroking me.
/me strokes RainbowEthan
In some cases, you don't need the friendship. :/
I was deeply disturbed on the bus from school once, my friend leaned over and said "We've all been in our mothers vagina"
... Viv... Help...
/me strokes RainbowEthan's eyes
Viv XD
... WHAT THE HELL.
Yeah you aren't going to win.
Better than the other exit, Vivix.
Truuee
Ninja.. Help meeeee
And at least we don't remember it
/me calls the Help Me hotline for RainbowEthan.
/me blocked call sound
Aye. Dispite people calling it a natutal miracle. It's a pretty traumatic experience.
back
Hello, this is the Help Me hotline
Sorry, we are currently on lunch break, try calling again later.
natural*
yes, help me hotline. ;A;
why!
RainbowEthan, i tried.
WHY IS EVERYBODY TOUCHING MEEEEE
I need help ;A;
:p
Ninjazz, yeaah, I don't think I want to watch the birth of anyone-
Cause we can.
Touching is fuun
*Comforts RainbowEthan by patting his head
/me comforts by stroking his hair
Vivix, I mean, if it was my son or daughter, then yeah... But if I was like a guest, i'm pretty sure I'd be one of those guys that'd faint on the spot.
Ninjazz, hehe, true, true
/me talks about child birth like it's a spectator event.
A friend of mine decided that if she were to ever have kids, she would adopt, because birth sounded so traumatizing to her
"Yo, man, I just wanted to see your child's birth!"
-Turns insane and urinates on Vivix to escape-
/me revels in pee
...
Well...
Wut.
Uh
this chat just got strange
Guys...
Nothing's going on, honest
What are you doing?
STAHP
That's a splendid thing to see when you look at chat for the first time today.
...This is the part where I must direct you to the rules page, you rambunxious peeeeeople.
yep
Agreed, DashWithRainbows.
Hehehe
....
Uh...
I blame RainbowEthan.
/me slowly walks away

I blame Saxy.
Let's all blame Saxy
I blame the calling center...
Good enough.
... Yeah, Saxy!
Always blame sxy.
NOBODY LIKES YOU SAXY
RainbowEthan: but we were on lunch break!

You don't go on lunch break when you run an emergency hotline
I like Saxy....he's cool
but..but..
Srs bsns for you
hi Blako
RainbowEthan Strange, I both like and love him.
They touched my butt
Not because of his jacket

"Emergency Hotline, one moment please. So I says to Mable I says"

Shut up Dash. NOBODY LIKES YOU
NOBODY
Nobody is a cool guy.
lol
You so just like for his jacket.
So shallow Dash
But, clothes makes the man
I don't see why you keep saying that Nobody likes me when that individual does.
wow
hey, i don't blame him.
His jacket's badassery.
I been listening to a finial fanasty music for 2 hours now
DashWithRainbows: he even blinded a cyclops once!
This has been the most fun I've had in IRC since that time I went onto a random IRC channel,
And did nothing for four hours
Hehe, this can be a very fun place
Welcome to ponychat.
When nobody is stroking me its fun
Don't spam 6 messages in under 10 seconds and you'll have a good time.
-Inches away from Vivix for safety-

Pony fans are alovely bunch aren't they :$
Nope.
Mmm..stroking

He really made it seem REAL.
I may be evil and snarky...
The emotions he displayed...
Tenannt was best doctor.
:<
eccleston was my favorite.
Indeed.
Jaymoo, that is a lie.
Why did he have to leaaaave.
I only saw Tennant, and even then only 3 episoodes
It's Matt Smith.
DWR PLS.
ikr.
-Stabs Dashwithrainbows in the eye-
i tell dabi that all the time.
FOR HUMANITYYYYY
>Implying I have eyes.
... What da faaaaaa
DWR is reading this chat with audio reader
DashWithRainbows: are you computa?
Silly Rainbow-E-Fan.
He has feelers below his fancy moustache.
-Rips his eyeballs out-
smith really plays the doctor well, but i like eccleston because he came before all the constant drama and angstyness.
BROTHER
Whoa whao whoa.
Yo, man.
Whoa whoa
WHOA
I'd hate to be THAT GUY.
But read the damn rules.
Smith is good but Karen really hindered him.
Barbetos|AtWork I'm not a robot. I'm a sentient piece of toast.
/me eats dwr
tbh, Doctor Who is going downhill.
I am smart now
Who was that directed to, Ninjazz?
D:
DashWithRainbows, do you go good with jam or jelly?
RainbowEthan: lies and slander
RainbowEthan, unfortunately, you.
>Jelly.
I'm getting heavy lag and my IRC client is lagging to no avail
Ahahaha
smith's character is terribly written
No.
Good >.>
So jam then?
i'm nekkid
wiat what
Smiths character is incredibly simple
No surprise.
satrun go to bed
Karren just really hindered him
hey everyone :)
hiya Lil_B
Well, it's nearing the rush hours here, so probably out soon
No you aren't Vivix.
thanks Vivix :)
You're staying.
/me holds on to Jmo
for a little whiil loonger okay
Awyeah.
Ninjazz I'm not trolling, advertising, I'm respecting, and I'm following every rule.
I exited for the B movie as far as I remember it it's kinda funny to Riff :)
RainbowEthan, you are RPing DWR's non-existant eyes out.
Well were.
Okay?
Ah yeah, rp rules are pretty strict, but the're floating and eh
mods kinda decide the point I guess
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Okay I get it.
YARHAR
anyway what are the movies this time?
05did i hear RP?
05O.-
OH HAI.
MAYBE.
jmo gets a FISH KILL!
Apparently I'm missing an eye, Wrek.
Mo-mo-monster kill
Eyesight is overrated anyways.
Dash is hipster
You can now wear a nice eye patch and have a legit reason to!
Jmo gives good advice
Apparently , I'm a hipster
Two eyepatches you mean
One step closer to being like Demoman!
:O
Now you just to get drunk all the time!
I really like this DORK PMV , the colors at the beginning and the end are really good to let the video loop :)
DashWithRainbows: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!
o_o
If I could both afford it and it didn't cause any health problems, I would be drunk much more often.

My mom and i bought a new dog, she's female, around 1 1/2 years, and i'm still thinking of the name
But I can't change my colors :(
Vivix: what does adasdad mean? :D
Dark92Enigma - breed?
eh, dunno, some guys username
Dark92Enigma: my name, probs.
had t since i was a kid, forget why.
maybe it's freudian adasdad, backward it is dad sad a, or a sad dad

Jmo: oh, sucks
A mod. :>
Jmo: good thing im invulnerable
Yeah I know. real shame.
like pastel rainbow
Dark92Enigma: i don't accept your apology, because i have no idea what you're a pologizing for. attempting to explain it would be useless, sso don't.
Or do it Phase4 style and odd a blue BG to the text.
Dark92Enigma, naming your dog?
adasdad: From where i come from, ''adasdad'' means random, so i giggled a bit, that's all :(
helt kompliitli rændåm
Vivix: no, the breed, she has none....therefore, i'm trying to find the word
Dark92Enigma: that's... actually very fitting for me. huh. k then.
8,1okay, i'll switch back to normal colours
oh a bastard?
Vivix: NOPE.
I was just getting used to the rainbow pain.
what u guys talking about?
8,1taste the painbow.
we sometimes call it gatemix, when dogs have no one breed
The rainbow is delicious
good dogs, if the mix is nice
8,1actually, yellow is probably my least favourite colour
I smell irony.
8,1i like blue more
Vivix: The word i'm trying to find is ''a mixture of breeds''
Dark92Enigma: a mut?
Hm. don't know any other english word for that
Ninjazz: since when did irony get a smell?
BladedWings: i think that is
I think bastard and mut is only I've heard
8,1but my OC (and colour no BS) is yellow because my favourite moth, the Comet Moth, is yellow

Vivix, http://iambrony.jsmart.web.id/mlp/gif/132705653660.gif
I am so fascinated by that dollmaker
she made a really cool male one, but his genitals are visible so can't post
._.
I'm so very scared.
hehe Oh Ninjazz
it looks like that thing would jump in ones face anytime it has opportunity
Silly Vivix, you can post goat r34 in here. Just not pony r34. :p
Oh god don't tell him that.

As long as we still get sleep at night.
hi
Hey
whats up?
okaay
Not much, just studying for a test for my next class
But honestly I think they're adorable, so not meant to creep people out
btw who are you guest?
ohhh
I forgot to /ns id
its ok
05jesus
05i have to bind the controls manually xD
Marketing
AKA easiest class ever
Yay voice
or..horse ish
then no stress right? :P
Nope
ill be a bit idly, cooking
I already have a really good grade in that class so I don't really care about it at all
Okay
Yeah no worries then :]
What did you buy the joystick for? Flyin'?
OOh, pretttty
05aye
hi everypony
Hi seatsea
I remember back when I playd Teewars, first step each time console:>bind k to kill
hi seatsea
I used to bind kill in half life, to not let people get score for killing me
"I'm dying! hit q!
hey seatsea
SR sort of disappeared last night
hi seatsea
Sup
yeah he used to do that a lot
weird he didn't come back though
hey Lambduh
Hey
SR probably won't be back for another two weeks now XD
and my current Motherboard can only support DDR2 :/ back to constructing a new one :/
._. seriously
Nah, he'll be back
He just won't talk
you construct a new one?
he has a habit of disappearing without telling anyone
Really pissed me off when we were friends
When he turns his laptop on he will probably come back but yeah he wont talk at all
well, I build myself a new PC is what I ment XD
aw ^^
wut
DDR2?
Ah well, luckily new mobos aint too expensive, but sometimes you have to replace so much other things
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
/me eats trout, then bites Jmo
I'll not make a Processor with a soldering iron and build everything from scratch XD
I'll need to leave for class pretty soon I guess
starts in 13 minutes
alrighty
05ok
dont freak out before the test :P
why? ^^
05most controsl bound
05problem is that soem keys stick
haha, I won't
05and suddenly i wotn stop turnign :|
What game you trying to get running, Wrek?
Vivix yeah :/ mine will get costly, I can't really cheap out on anything, I need a good Prozessor+RAM for working, a decent grafics card for gaming, and a good Soundcard to properly hear music :/
05playign planetside 2 configuring my joystick for flying
Oh. OH NICE!
Invi well, I think a 4 Bit Processor that needs 100Watt to run would be a possibility XD
Lil_B, yeah, same here. With music I chose to go for much ram and CPU- worth it in the end
Vivix yeah, same Idea for me, hopefully this November/December
Heya everypony! :D
800 watt, 16gb ddr3 eh 3.4ghz i7 2600..260 GTX I think (not sure will check)
hey Sonny!
Is The_Engineer online, is he is he??
damnit
to alte again :/
late* >_>
670 GTX
thanks Lil_B :)
well it only pulls what it needs, as far as I understand
Vivix that's a really good System :)
so I run 800 watt- just in case
Thanks
hi Sonny
00,10Guess i should log in and watch wrek crash alot
00,10wreks wrecks
wrek's wrecks wrecked the rec'
^
Vivix yes, normally it should do this, but sometimes it thinks "well... I could go that high... I don't really need to but I'm going to anyway" XD
say that 5 times fast
Ah yeah, true
Hehe Sylandest iimpossible
My battery be dyin'
oh noes
May not be on much longer
Arr
Lil_B: :O :D
I am pretty bad at guessing how much power you need, but I guess the graphic card will give you a good indication, and you pop maybe 100 watt over that
Hello Sumica
hey Sylandest !

Ryunosuke: Puling?
Oh hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hi, Good morning everyone

Hey GabeMoist, TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
BladedWings: I can't recognise Sumica's voice yet. :P

Is it mouse based tilt like crysis?
Hey
Oh mai.
/me licks Ninjazz
>_>
Ohh.. kay?
Hey Ninjazz.
Does the x/y control roll/pitch?
-Copies Gunthler-
Hey Rainbow Ethan guy.
Ethan is a muffin, not a guy.
I am a Muffinman
I meant the way you're using it. Thanks for the reply
Borrred.
I like you, Ninjazz! You're way less grumpy than Meanwhile :D
Well... Pretty much anyone is less grumpy than Meanwhile, you know... He's Brit. And I'm a Murikan. I jus don't got the snark.
Wrek, forgot to crop. It's ZOOMED.
Ninjazz is secretly a duck
Wut.
All good.
Ninjazz, ADMIT IT.
I will do no such thing.
You feathered FIEND.
Ninjazz is a Jazzy Ninja.
Wrek: roll is turn around the forward-backward axis(move left-right), pitch is turn around left-right axis(move forward-backwards), and yaw is turn around up-down axis (turn around)
That I will admit to.
MadSurge, you have a point. Though I shall concede and say I appreciate the fact that you like me. :3c
-Stabs Jazz.-
I always hated music...
\(-_-)/
Jazz isn't that bad enough to deserve a stab...
:3
/me dances on Ninjazz s head
:3
Ninjazz: not that I hate the other chatgoers, mind you :D
Wrek: Sorry to confuse you with my terminoligy
*terminology
/me has a dancing creature on his head.
MadSurge, oh I wouldn't think that. But I don't get the phrase "I like you often".
Hi everypony.
Actually... I do...Hmmm.
Hey Purple`Prose.
hi Purple`Prose
College work is done, how is the joystick holding up, Wrek?
|(o.o)--<|----D Shovel?
Wrek: So does it stick?
Out of curiousity, anyone have any idea what the Wonderbolts outfits are made out of?
Haiyo esorP' elpruP
Wrek: Can you increase the deadzone?
I did it...
For teh lolz.
Sooo someone in here uses Desura ?
Purple`Prose, latex ofc.
Ooo Latex...
...what game is this?
Planetside 2
Planet Side 2.
ah
Im so greasy
Wrek: I mean is the physical stick sticking or is it the sensor?
Ninjazz: it's just that sometimes I like telling people I like them just for being there and being themselves :D You either have to be very slimy or an asshole to be hated by me :D
MadSurge: i shall do my best to earn that award
Hello, my friends!
Wrek: Deadzone is the area which is counted as centered
Hello, Shadow.
... Im so greasy
hello [OC]ShadowQuill
Has anyone begun the clans yet?
Wrek: Flight sim?
Clans?
Oh, nametag clans?
FlutterTree: you don't like me? :(
MadSurge, welp. I appreciate it all the same. And don't worry, I'm pretty sure my moods isn't that bad that I'll be anywhere near a jerk.
Is that what [OC] is?
[OC] is the clan for the ones that have their OC for names. We should start doing this
MadSurge: no, im just gonna make you, not like me :D
>_>
And who leads this "clan"?
LOLCLAN
FlutterTree: :P
... If Jmo does it I'm in.
... Jmo do it.
No leaders, just make up a clan and put it before your names. It's great fun!
Also holy shit Ninjazz, I think my inner Pinkie came out on that paragraph :D
I'd rather go play with toy soldiers.
-Stabs Jmo-
MadSurge, I actually have to agree. ^_^
Oh hush you.
And holy shit, MadSurge, you still cool. :3
Wrek: Worth a try
I regret joining #brony
So much...
That channel is...
GreasyEthan: ORLY
Pucker up princess.
Wrek: it's usually in calibration
Imma cinderella
I don't know anyone here. Bye for now!
Ninjazz: Me? Cool? Pffftttnah :D
Ethan has caught onto my drift so easily.
So wise.
But thanks a lot :3
MadSurge, oh I assure you. You're somewhere between the freezer and the Artic Ocean.
Dat Sumica's chuckle :D
Ninjazz: *bows*
Look at it go!
MadSurge, why question though, why compare me to Meanwhile?

hi SpadeMagnes[School]
yo Spade!
Stream was overrated anyway \(>_>)/
Apperently a live action Halo movie is in the works...
I got a ad for it on youtube
Metal gear is in the works too
GreasyEthan: You take that back!
bye
I have my doubts
And so is MLP Movie.
bye flutt...aww
No, Monkey
The history with video game movies is not so good
Eat a platypus
See Mario Bros for example
Mortal Kombat one was okay.
Haiyo [loohcS]sengaMedapS!
So is Ender's Game movie!
The original one.
They should make a Slenderman o- I take it back
That would be terrible.
... Oh god why...
/me strokes GreasyEthan
Didnt the guy who played "bowser" in the mario movie say he didnt like it?
-Enjoys it-
NOW you enjoy it?
Yes.
Bollocks to you.

Have any of you guys heard of or played Mischief Makers for the N64?
/me openly admits to sniffing cakes.
Hi Chrysalis
SpadeMagnes[School]: yup
-Admits to sniffing Monkey-
I swear you need a fucking guide for some of those gold gems
His name was weird
Also despite my belief you could not, I was able to catch fireballs among other things...
...
Silent chat...
/me slaps GreasyEthan around a bit with a large trout
Anyhoo...back to watchign Deceased Crab play the Chzo mythos series
-Enjoys it and licks Jmos ear-
Who the hell are you and what have you done with Ethan.
How old is the N64 anyway?
14 years?
Mine still works
Gets tiny bits of slowdown in some games
I'm...
16 years*
A DUCK
Close enough.
QUACK QUACK
Kbutsrsly I stuffed his body in the closet
With Molestia
So how is a n64 able to last so god damn long but consoles now adays die fairly easy?
:<
It's due to the hardware.
N64 is pretty solid state.
Because back then, people took pride in their console construction.
Since it still works how much would a N64 and a collection of games go for?
I have stuff like Paper Mario, OOT,Majoras Mask...
He was the Dovahkin
/me slaps GreasyEthan around a bit with a large trout
Jmo will you save Ethan?
NOP
/me should look into an N64 emulator. ;)
-Creepily rubs Jmo's ears-
Apperently Banjo cameoed in Diddy Kong racing befor he even had his own game
And Conker's origional...less darker form was in it too..
I'm warning you, I'm Australian.

A freezer in the junkyard

Chrysalis Nice table.

He tried hitting on me and taking Vivix away.
:>
Bad Jaymoo.
Bad.
Love you too.
/me awakens

dabi would be proud.
Daru is a butt.
Lawl
Which is why Ollie loves him so much.

Bored bored bored
if you say DaabiiiDaaabiii it sounds like a french ambulance
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MgNRTq4Uu4
The french have ambulances?
hopefully
The things we learn each day.

Fatality?
FINISH HIM.
NAO.
armny?
/me cuts Jmo in halve
halve
but nobody named "HIM" is here..
*half
Finish twilight_sprinkle.
halve, thats a cool word
Like a hybrid fof valve and half-life.
Halve.
/me tries to finish twilight_sprinkle but instead fails and finished Jmo
or maybe that's jsut me.
just*
youre just a halve?
One does not simply finish Jmo.
You're right.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXrymV-Lgtw&feature=related
well, numbers dont easily finish people, thats true
You just throw him in the trash when you don't want him.
Ignore him.
Aww you're so charming DWR.
okay
<3
i need to find an extra-stinky trash can
Awww, you must be either high or drunk, seeing that you gave me a compliment , you shlag <3
Start stoppin
Maybe I'm both. :>
spart moppin
so i voted for kung fu hustle and the castle of caglistro in the lottery this week
how are you guys?
alexxm: oi, you stole my a-movie!
Never heard of either of those movies
*gasp*
twilight_sprinkle i didn't know
DWR, are you like a clone of dabi? or the opposite of him?
alexxm: ok, i dont really care :P
You've never heard of Kung Fu Hustle or Castle of Cagliostro?
alexxm: the more people vote for it the bigger choice of it winning too
dammit I want the next walking dead episode to come out already
I'm probably the original.
Seeing I'm older than him,
You aren't even spiderman bro.
Maybe he is my upgrade.
Who knows.
I'm just some sentient freaking toast.
Maybe you're brothers.
Lawl
The world shall never know.
[18:30:14] <Jmo> Maybe you're brothers.
I say otherwise.
FOREVER SAVED
>__>
We can find out. Might have to do a few tests, but we'll find out.
No need.
Awww, I was getting my kit ready and everything. :c
Lawl
Just put Daru, Matt Smith, David Tennant and I in the same room.
Lol.
/me starts teleporting around
Oh that'd be something I'd pay to watch.
If M.S. isn't dead in 1 minute of the door being closed while Daru flirts with D.T.
Then we are not brothers.
Seems legit.
And Dabi will do that in span of one minute? o_O
Gee sure is boring around here
Wouldn't be surprised.
SpadeMagnes[School]: you forgot an "it" :D

Derpy Woofs?

Celestia
but no
closer
Lyra?
Cold
The Shizuka is a magnificent creature to observe. Whilst it yawns from it's slumber, it will then go on the hunt for something to eat,most likely some baked goods or will try to find the nearest source of wubs. For reasons we can not explain, the Shizuka has a natural close friendship with the creature known as the VioletVanilla, or more commonly known as the Vivi. Seeing that the Shizuka
has a interest for wubs, this is a small factor as to why they are very good friends.
you're cold
Have a text wall :3
WALL OF TEXT
13croikey
kicked out again, and it says 127
Vinyl?
Speaking of Vivi, how is she?
no
I should do stuff like that more often

It's fun to write.
Awww. I wasn't aware. :(
oh yeah Dark92Enigma want to see something funny i saw that was from ecw
DashWithRainbows, then write fanfics
Doctor Whooves?
Nah.

Documentaries of mods will be a small yet fun thing for me.
Gummy?
Oh no Shizuka!

Ooh

/me gives Jmo offering of 1 derpy
SpadeMagnes[School]: then you haven't seen the 2nd season finale,

I've seen it..
I saw it here

I generally don't chat until episode is over anyway
05back
Is there ever a show where royals actualy do anything? All the shows I see, royals dont do anything helpful

SpadeMagnes[School]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure
good evening guys!
Good old tv tropes
'ello Alchemist
Wrek I think part of the issue is that they are too focused on keyboard and mouse at the moment, and the sad part is that a plane would be way easier for precision with a joystick
13this sounds like a job for shizu the not-really-a-pyro-and-not-very-good-at-close-range
Hi
are we playing TF2 now?
wrek, on PS2?
Shizuka: There are flame throwers in PS2 =P
It may just be petty reasoning, but I really dont like Celestia sometimes..
13yeah but they're stupid expensive
Heyo Alchemist!
Ugh. Araxium is so hard to get.
At least release will ahve more of the junk
15% for what?
I adore canon Celestia and Luna, based on the tiny parts we've seen, but- I like that kind of people
I have to admit I really like the NC weapons in Planet Side 2 more than the first one.
I just did some measurements with an instrument that I have no idea what it actually does...
my god ps2 loads so nicely on an SSD
13derp..
Huge percentage jump
13tell sumica i have to take care of something quick >>
13also mfw 3k certs
Noice.
You get 5k certs every day
certs?
Wut
thats about a cert every 10 seconds?
Oi DWR, isn't summer coming for pom land?
ok
Wrek is using certs right now
They get you things, mostly attachments, side grades.
demo sos!
Things like that
yeah i have to go to class soon
rour
New weapons and things are bought with the in game currency or your RL monies
Hi everyone :)

But you got everything, just had to cert into what you wanted to do
Is wreks face cam lagging?
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
What is with you and fish?

Poms and their tea.
Now don't y'all go disrespectin' me, Joomay.
The fuck is a Pom
A pom? An english person.
Waught kind of Brit isn't sippin awn tea 24/7?
Me.
I inject it.
Also a potato snack in Australia.
Hawdcore Brit.
You're more than alright.
U scary.
But Joomay
you are a potato snack
BUT WUT
I know I am tasty. You don't have to tell me.
No homo, Sumica :3
Why would you complain about being rich?
Easy.
ASoftFluffyThing: here's that ping you ordered
I would be more of a dick.
HAHA.
Is that even possible. <3
Yes.
Talk to me during the summer.
I reeaaallly dislike summer.
Ignore the giant metal ship in the air
DWR version of a period, summer. eh?
Fall and Winter all the way, baby.
Somewhat joomay.
Lawl. Looking forward to it.
shizu wrek says join the call and mute if you dont wanna be heard
Meh, I'll most likely avoid being around here when that time comes.
Is there even a release date for this yet?
I'd enjoy winter more if it'd feel like damn winter here.
D'aww but I wanna poke you with sticks.
and annoy you.
13sorry stereo mix is still default in
Shizuka thats why he said mute mic
PRO LANDING
so you can still hear properluy
properly*
Joomay, you can not annoy me, you don't know the rules to break.
Daru knows some
Then I'll refer to asking him.
:>
Bring eet.
o i will
just4u
13hm did skype detect a game is running... i don't remember the little popup showing for other group calls
Unless you exploit my fear.
Spiders?
Yep.
Heh.
I love spiders.
Yeah, well...
I don't.
:>
Daru knows how serious my fear is.
Spiders need to go die
Oi leave spiders alone, they're cool.
ASoftFluffyThing: Did ya get that ping i sent ya ^_^
Fine, all spiders go to Joomay's country.
We don't need them 'ere.
joystick. Nice.
spiders eats the evil mosquitos :3
Australia welcoes them. lawl.
Well they need to stay out of my fucking house

I like the silly :3
So whats the point of capturing everything if the game never ends a round or something?
ASoftFluffyThing: ping ^_^
Blindsided...
Fuuuuck it's not working!
Hello everyone.
Hi Meanwhile
ohai Meanwhile
Hey Meanwhile.
how are things Meanwhile
hai Meanwhile
hi Meanwhile
Uninteresting alexxm. How 'bout you?
i'm good Meanwhile
Anybody know how to get a nick to ping in the main chat in HexChat?
I'm trying and it's not working so far.
Did they change the hud or is that an option Wrek ?
I come back, and hi Meanwhile :)
Heh, quadsquad.
Interest for this game is steadily rising.
Wait for when it is a full release.
It will be F2p.
I'd rather not.
Well
Oh gawd yes. Now if only I had a machine to run it on. :<
Shaddap Jaypoo.
luvu2dwr
Ew, gay.
Keep thinking that
I will.
You know how you can tell if your computer is powerful enough? Try running Crysis
lolcrysis
Ninjazz I know that feel. I brought Alpha squad for this, can't run the game but still, it was worth the £30.
Turns out if you buy AS, you get a bonus code for a friend.
Gave it to Fluttercry.
Nice. Good man. Still painful.
All these maps seems like its really easy to snipe people
Well, I hope to get money for my custom soon.
I got to save up for college/uni. And that's /IF/ I get out of fucking Highschool.
Ah.
Goddamn math.
No money for you DWR.
I dread college
If you lived in England, you pay for College if you are above the age of 19.
My brother is STILL paying for his college and he's been out for awhile
Joomay, how so?
Did you steal my mooney again?
Cause you spend it all on tea.
Lies.
maybe I did.
:>
I'm 18, that means... if I somehow moves to Angle Land next year or so, more expenses.
Well he went to marquette but anyway...
>:l
Hel all!
Hey
Hey Randomnerd.
hi Randomnerd
Hi, Ninjazz , BladedWings
The_Engineer: Don't know if he's linked you to it yet, but Sonny's been asking for you.
I'm not going to be around this weekend, wanted to say hi.
So... hi.
Stealin' is wrong, Jaymoo.
Bad for your health.
like vegetables.
Not if it involves you or dabi.
Stealing is bad mkay
It depends on the cause. Would you steal if you you feeding starving orphans?
Hello everypony!
Implying I would care for kids.
Oh, did I show you guys this pic? hold on.
Lol.
hi Calcos323
Hey Calcos323.
What game might this be?
Skyrim.
lol
Doom
Calcos323: Planetside 2
Thank you
U ruined the joke BladedWings.
It's Doomrimside 2.
Joke wasn't funny to begin with, man
Too bad.
Party pooper.
DashWithRainbows: i know, sowwy
Whoa whoa. Didn't mean to get personal.
BLINDSIDED
I enjoyed it.
More power to ya
Everyone is being mean to Toast today.
http://tinypic.com/r/dgj5mt/6
First jaymoo, then joomay.
Don't worry, man. Someday we ALL will butter you yp.
up*
:l
That sounded soooo wrong.
wut?
Who's Toast?
Toast?
I am.
Wut? No bread jokes?
I'll butter you up Ninjazz
You aren't Toast.
Yes I am.
I'm not Toast, GabeMoist!
No you aren't.
My nickname IRL is Toast.
Lol why?
http://i48.tinypic.com/dgj5mt.jpg
NO.
I LOVE TOAST.
It can't be true
Sorry, there it is.
That has to be the weirdest nickname ever
I ran into this guy at the Renaissance Festival :D
Because I was late to a class in year 8 and I was holding 3 sliced of toast from home.
Walked in and ate it while everyone stared at me.
It was weird.
Like a boss.
Yet delicious.
How is that even weird.
Why does alot of stuff in life sound fun, but then it becomes hell?
That's alot better than the names I've been given.
Imagine if you were teaching P.E. and you see a student walk in the middle of your lesson, late and eating toast.
I'd find it humorous.
I'd lol.
Wrek: trees are getting bloodthristy?
I'd laugh at the fact that they're calmly eating toast.
I have brought in pizza, ice cream, noodles and some other things into lessons.
What a cool kid.
I know right?
So kewl.
The Happening
The movie was retarded
yet so gangsta at the same time.
DashWithRainbows: too thug lol
I didn't choose the thug life...
Because I have some intelligence.
:l
^
:D
Bollocks to you DWR.
You chose it.
I'm not a chav.
Psshtt
I just live amongst many of them.
I will never understand Yolo
Ninjazz Noodles reminds me of one of the monsters in RE5.
DashWithRainbows, I ALREADY which one. >_<
DashWithRainbows: the Uroboros monster?
I think it was the one you have to get in a furnace.
theres two of those
I'll put you in a furance.
Yeah. Freaking slimey things everywhere.
and kill with the assistance of a flamethrower later in the campaign.
The furnace one and one you kill with a Kil Sat
/me giggles.
*Kill Sat
/me didn't know there was any Ghosties to giggle at.
jaymoo I'll put you in a microwave.
pls do
/me chortles
kaykay
Wat?
LadyCanary! :$
I found it funny it took the word of the makers of RE5 for people to believe Wesker is actually dead for good
Hey.
Microwave time woop
/me forgot which monster is affected by chortles.
Betrayle
Ninjazz: ghoulies? :D
the ghoulies might grab you
I don't know! It's been too damn long since I've heard the song.
He mad.
When I'm capable of playing this game
Calling now, he gets booted
Which is never.
All I will do is follow Wrek until he lays down his mines
ohai pony ponies
and try to teabag as many as possible.
Creative.
What is the point of teabagging
Hey Ish.
Humilation.
its so immature
hi IshPonyPony
It entertains 13 year olds.
Immature?
It's quick to do and is a taunt to your enemy.
My god what are you doing on the internet.
SpadeMagnes[School] because n00bs can't triforce
It marks your territory.
Only thing I find more stupid than teabagging is Yolo
It's dominance thing.
It's a*
Mai gawd, y dunt u shuddap, Joomay?
y dnt u?
because I'm wellard.
MEH
Yeah that was quite nice.
Find it funny you said that, Wellard is in my state.
Ironic.
lolwut
Is it full of chavs?
Wellard, Western Australia.
How am I suppose to know. >_>
I don't travel the state checking for chavs.
Seriously who was the idiot who came up with YOLO
I'm sure it was Sith.
Entirely possible.
Being that it is annoying.
It's a high chance it was 'im :P
Bwahahaha.
Reminds me, heard Gangnam Style on the radio earlier.
oh god
what!? no way Meanwhile
Please tell me you turned it off straight away, Meanwhile.
I would have if it were my radio.
<.<
hey im new just a quick question. Whats that "friday movie night"?
...
You jus don like k-pop.
A night where DWR invades your home.
>Come to Bronystate
>Don't know about movienight.
What joomay said.
It's when it's friday and movies are on during the night

It is true.

welcome Purple_Edge when the countdown is down up there, the mods will stream movies
SpadeMagnes[School]: Sounds like someone needs a firm kick in the ass.
Joomay is missing a couch and has a sore bum from butt pinches.
And our toast, DWR?
Dat gif, Meanwhile.
Why would I steal toast?
well thank you and sry for that stupid question xD i just laughed my ass of by my own stupidity "whats a movie night derp?"
For names sake.
It was worth it.
I'd just steal your bread
And welcome, Purple_Edge! ^_^ Make sure you read the rules here first so your experience will be an enjoyable one
and toast it at home
rules? where?
as a victory feast.
Right because you clearly scare me Meanwhile
Purple_Edge: its cool, there are no stupid questions here for new people ^_^
I can supply them if need be.
I like Friday Movie Night.
You're evil as you are cunning.
Aww, more compliments.
Go jump in a fire <3
So charming.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Motherfucker I don't care about you but I won't be having you bringing your bad mood my way.
I'm not toast. That's not my thing.
I'm doing it right, am I not?
Zing.
Purple_Edge: here are the rules: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
As a Brit, you sure are.
Snarks.
hmmm "do not troll" on what line does "having fun" spring over to "trolling"?
How am I in a bad mood, you know what...nevermind
When you're intentionally trying to grief instead of trying to have a laugh.
Unless you're Daru.
ah alright^^
Purple_Edge: and Brony Movie Night is the night when we have 2 movies, with 2 pony episodes inbetween
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout

Jerk.
You love it.
But I disliek fish.

Blame Olly for that name.

You've come to the wrong place.
"browniestate" that could be the name of a bakery
God no.

BECAUSE. Only bread is allowd.

Ninjazz: why.

Apparently.
Don't ask me why, just is.

Ninjazz: Explain.

Malavolent, explain...what? Bread? Or brownies?
im confused... whats that game? so there is the SC2 Soundtack.... its a egoshooter.... and its "3+"
Ninjazz: Both.

Malavolent: actually, i've been here from the start. that'S why iÄm confused

0,5Dark_Horst: I work behind the scenes of Bronystate
Lies.

Ninjazz: This conversation leads nowhere, wouldn't you agree?
All of them.
Lies.
Working behind the scenes in this case means eating donuts.
0,5But im on the front lines during the season premiere episodes
Dark_Horst: Damn, don't ruin it for me.
0,5So youll see more of me then
Like your promises DWR.
:<
Implying I make promises.
:P
Wat did I come back to?

Ah bollocks to you.
I don't want them/
You keep them.
0,5Flim and Flam are my uncles
0,5Theyre gay together
Stop killing yourself.
I'll just go play with my wombat.
ASoftFluffyThing: i dont know XD
Who is that fellow on the stream?
Malavolent, I agree. It's going as fast as...Hmmm. Bread baking... :I
stop killing yourself!
nice game
his bacon thing comes from this one time when he was showing us all his alicorn OC and I was all like 'Dude, that abomination's hair looks like bacon.'
uncles..... so uncles on your moms or dads side?
Malavolent It's Scoots.
Ninjazz: Yum, facts.
0,5The bacon joke was my idea
And then it all escalated from there.
0,5all mien
0,5me
Bullshit
0,5ME
Bullshet
DashWithRainbows: Why does he want us to see him?
Lies
Because he's hawt.
well bacon is always hawt
Scoots became Swedish and had surgery to look like Wrek.
Pfft
Well, can't argue on that.
Who is totally not on the stream.
0,5Scoots: my alicorn OC is obsolote. Besides, even when It was my OC, it was a joke OC, i didn't give it a story or anything
>Obsolote
Doesn't Wrek wear glasses by the way?
0,5Then again, I dont do that with my curent character
Pahaha.
0,5OBSOLETE
0,5jeez

Da afk is a lai.
Ninjazz: Farewell.
Bye Ninjazz
bye Ninjazz
if you think abstractly a little and place your lefthand where your right is and vice versa.... and are used to press O with your right "fuck-off-finger" you COULD hit E instead...
it IS possible...
/me wonders how that referred to himself.
tl;dr
ohai..
0,5It's middle finger
Hey ekips.

If you type with your face I can see how that'd happen.

Anyway, what is Wrek playing?
Same here Joomay.
I guess the shoe is on the other foot.

Malavolent Planetside 2
Malavolent It's Halo.
Planetside 2, Playstation 2. Gfdi.
or do they mean those old mouses and keyboards?
Halo 5 to be exact.
^
hi eveypony
DashWithRainbows: LOL, they think I'm stupid enough to believe it's some "planetside".
It's Crash Bandicoot : Space Opera.
hi something
IKR?
crash bandicoot.... you just unleashed the fury of nostalgica
Try harder peeple
Of course it's halo, there isn't any other game like this.
nou ashie-poo

Nah.
I dislike that.
No thanks.
So I won't.
:3
Nope.
hi aspest
Eh, Witchcraft's kinda lame.
but
>implying no one knows it already
What a rebel.
its awesome
I kinda liked one episode of witchcraft, but it isn't that great imo.
Meanwhile: no!
Joomay IKR? Time to make some trouble for the establishment.
aspest: Yes.
I probably like FiW a bit more than the actual show
Woop woop.
Meanwhile: no
aspest: Yes.
Meanwhile: no
Aspest pls
aspest: Yes.
Lol'd
Maybe? Can't we compromise here?
well FiW... EP 2 - 7 are good... 1 is kinda lame <.<
Meanwhile: NO
aspest: Yes.
Teh man says Yes.
Meanwhile: NO. DAMMIT
No means no, yes means yes.
aspest: Yes.
:I
well you`re a poppy head!
You're so wise DWR. Teach me your ways.
What is going on? I leave for a second and everyone has fun. Well I can see I'm not needed here :>
I take offense to the implication that my cranium is flowered.
HO SHIT. WE'RE GETTING PERSONAL NOW.
DWR-sensei, please teach me.
/me pats ASoftFluffyThing
i started the flood by asking a stupid question... sry ASoftFluffyThing xD
Joomay First, you must delete system 32, scream YOLO and punch David Tennant in the face while flipping off Daru.
Meanwhile: it is very flowered
Dat is the way of DWR.
/me pats Jmo back
/me hugs ASoftFluffyThing "no, dont go, i need something to hug" :)
You know that sounds like it would be fun DWR.
aspest: Well your face is a lilly.
It is.
Troost me.
DWR: You just didn't offend David Tennant right now, i dislike you from this moment on.
i cant remember growing plant-looking hair latly---
Good.
Flipping off dabi would be my favourite.
I like haters <3
And aww poor diddums Malavolent.
btw... aspest isnt used as material for furniture anymore right? cause poisonous n stuff i think
DashWithRainbows: I don't hate you, I just really, really, really dislike you.
Purple_Edge: that hurt my feelings
Dat's hate in mah bewks.
...I hear ringing.
DWR: In that case I love you.
yes
Who's calling Wrek?
Ew, gay.
aspest: wasnt my intention :(
DWR, if dabi eats faces, then what do you do?
DWR: What, you are brownie and you're not gay?
/me suddenly feels awkward in the chat
Purple_Edge: yay! unintentional insulyness!
I'm not gay
I'm bi.
Get it roight.
DashWithRainbows: lol
Geez.
ASoftFluffyThing: why you feel awkrard?
No you're lesbian.
aspest: sry i would give out free hugs... but well.... i like to be kept healthy^^
I'm bi as well.

GedditriteDWR

Everyone in this thread is so bi.
Purple_Edge: use a suit dammit!
I'm just not picky dont need a label!
LadyCanary U never understand me!!!!!"1

aspest: i dont have any suit. i lent my only suit to some wird fellow in the forest...
It's just a phase, DWR.

I dun care
Phase... yeah... a 40 year one ;)
Purple_Edge: he keeps turning me around for some reason, yes he dont speak a word
Joomay, I eat... Um...

I dunno
I eat what I want.
Think about it.
dat breathing...
Not good enough.
Yo, DWR, do you like me?
aspest: did he say anything about my suit? he just refuses to give it back <.<
Specifications or gtfo.
Nope.
and i always end up setting his notes back up... why doesnt he do this shit alone?
Why not, DWR
Fahn, I eat your butt, Joomay.
Because I hate everyone.
Purple_Edge: he`s a mute
Giggity.
Good friday evening guys

/me hugs ASoftFluffyThing back. it's soft and fluffy

Not the game, the stream.
Malavolent Nah, only Olly knows the way I show love.
And no, even the stream is not safe.
Actually thos're just there for funsies.
Malavolent: thats funny cuz he swears like a sailor
Should be rated NSFW
DWR: Now who the hell is Olly?
RainBroDash.
Not Safe From Wrek
soooo..... the stream is for 3+... but there are games shown for 18+? (BUCK LOGIC) :D
Silly Malavolent.
aspest: I don't know about that, got my stream muted.
DWR: Whatcha hidin' fram meh?
well then just take my word for it Malavolent
Based on Sumica's current laguage, I wouldn't exactly call this family friendly.
Everythin'.
You be mean, DWR:

ASoftFluffyThing: yeah? i don't really see the sun much over here... well, no wonder at 9am
9 AM.... not sure if extremly far west or extremely far EAST
Purple_Edge: ahh pm, pm!

oh oh oh! do fleur de lis!
didnt find anything in the FAQ
!eightball
aww
aw
!calc
but she's a unicorn
Why can't I hold all these botcomands?
Purple_Edge: it's to divide people during livestreams of pony episodes
Purple_Edge Nothing more of a main chat diversion so theres not purely chatting in manechat
but she uses and alicorn body type
do we even have a bot in here?
wait a second... these are all OP commands! I should've known! :[
i don't think we do
not a publically callable one, anyway
Last time I checked.
/me explodes in
hey MaxTheBrony!
;kickcount Ninjazz

PANDA!
Turned off I see.

hey everypony :)
of ALL TIME
"chat reactions <enter episode name here>" has managed it to
Panda, you were gone? o_O loljk, I was away for a while too.
Ninjazz -___- I was moving states... I thought you would have noticed.
Purple_Edge: not during livestreams, or the lag made by the chat would kill your computer.
Purple_Edge Yeah you can probably have every side channel openened during BMN
Panda: I almost thought you forgot about me :'( I've been well.
TIL Panda is a Finite State Automaton
Panda, I was aware. I was kidding.
well i got a 100.000 DSL :D think thats not the prob
ImOkayWithThis| hehe I would never :3 you are awesome
oh hay Panda :D
Panda: it's because Ninjazz dosn't wub you like I do~

DeathStar, I'm sorry. I'm half asleep here. What did you say?
I might miss the first episodes of season 3 D:
need "if you know what i mean"-meme on the end of that
MadSurge Well i like the nice and tight thing we have in the summers
ok brb........got some chores to do
Ninjazz: I said I'm sure noone is very happy to be loved by someone as nice as you :)
killerpony7733: that too :3
i should get back into ham radio
HAM radio?
ham has its own radio?
mmmmmm ham
what about bacon?
Panda: what?
DeathStar, Well, I'm actually not sure how to take that.
Yay my torrent sped up to 2.1 megabytes / second :D
Ninjazz: ...it's not an insalt :)
2.1 MB cute :D
ah
it's because my server is still off
aww :(
so i'm using the flash client
how come?

Panda: i'm moving it
:3
DeathStar, Oh I wouldn't dream of hearing an insult from you. Just I don't know or probably can't understand anything atm. ^_^;
oh nice, i'll be able to boot my server in about 5 minutes
Ninjazz: :) well I'm too sleepy to explain XD
DeathStar, and in a good mood, it seems.

Purple_Edge Nope side channels first open when the movie night starts
Ninjazz: well panda is back ^_^ so I is happy

I might be leaving soon
DeathStar, that would explain it then.

dat feeling when you come home and there are no updates in your favourit fimfictions....
O-o
what have I stumbled on to?
Purple_Edge Meh not a fanfic person
Purple_Edge, try my feel. Every time I start up my FimFiction, I see 174 updates and 160 to read laters.
wuw
LadyCanary!!! how is you!
Oh, hello Panda. Im alright. Yourself?
so... you are only following 9 people and get 160 updates per day?
sounds legit :D
I'm awesome miss Canary :)
I wish my dad would buy me a new pair of headphones already, I keep asking him
Mission accomplished by the sound of it.
DeathStar D: thats not a moon?
Panda: no that's a space station
It seems really hard to tell where you get shot sometimes
hey guys
hm i could also buy some new ones.... theres tape all over mine and one side is cracked off

Road hog
BUGS!
Homeschooling anyway....
hi Cades
Tanks for nothing guys
man you scared me there
i read tHanks for nothing guys
I love how you can shove a tank out of the way with brute force
HORSE!
The camera is sort of making me dizzy with it going all over the place...
Achivement Horse?
yeah totally not unfair 1v1.... tank vs human
Kaboom there goes a tank
Tank kills wraith
Tank kills Hunter!
Haunter
:3
guys, I just finished Crysis again today. I needed to lower the Graphic settings from High to Medium, so my PC wouldn't freeze during the final Boss.
lol
everytime i hear wraith i instinctively think of a pale ghastly ghostfigure with claws...
Again Crysis is the ultimate test of computer power
I guess that final boss was your computer
:)
Purple_Edge: You thinking Stargate Wraith?
na dat wraith has armor
im talking about the general description of the mythical beast wraith
Uh oh Sumica is cackeling
yo yo yo Sumica
The wraith I was refering to was the Wraith Tank
yeah thought so
would be strange to see a pale ghost in a scientific multiplayer FPS
yet not impossible
God how can you not get slightly disorented with the way the camera goes in the vehicles?
i think the camera is cool
especially when its inside sometanks ass
Wut
Oh my god JC a bomb
im reffering to the bugs...
a bomb?
SpadeMagnes[School] A bomb!
I whent wut because the tank suddenly exploded
Go Not-Mongoose!
suddenly third person
Woah camera woah
i like the graphicsdesign and angle of the mountains
do you call them mountains?
or are they more like canyonwalls?
LOL

so Season 1
will they die via crash or foe?
Purple_Edge, indeed file island ^^
Invi! :3
MadSurge, :3
hey MadSurge ! :3
Inb4 more allies set the mines off\
Purple_Edge I only upped the Sduntrack for some people :)
ah ok
Purple_Edge: as you can see we stream anything mods like, because some people don't like ponies 24/7
im fine with both
lali-ho y'all
I hear a second person!
hey Dken2021 :3
:O
and hi LadyCanary !
well hello there skippy
Hiya Lil_B, hiya Dken2021
Purple_Edge skippy? that's my father's name
lowest settings are worst settings you-dont-say.jpg
ugh, I dont think I will wait for the movies tonight. I feel like crap.
So why was TF2 made F2P?
hey there Lil_B and LadyCanary
so i can play it
because hats
Wrek (the current streamer) likes games and drawing art, Sumica likes games and anime, and so on
Alchemist hello :) haven't seen you in a week :)
and because fckn hats
hai Alchemist ^^
and hi ekips (so many people suddenly Oo)
I'm fine, except that moment when I was about to throw my laptop out of the window
Everyone is getting sick
Purple_Edge: ^ping :D
:9
:(
ping wut?
Lil_B: Hi! Yes, I've been busy lately, and sick too.
I'm playing PS2 at the moment, lurked an hour for now in chat :P
hay ekips, what level are you actually? ^^
i cant read my ping in chat oO
why you want my ping?
there is some problem in C++ I cannot solve
Now why would you do that? Not co-operating or something?
Invi, don't ask
Lil_B: I hope you are doing fine though :)
:D
Purple_Edge: the message before that one, read it :D
very serious problem
ah ok
im fine with everything
Not sure throwing your laptop will solve much but a minor sense of satisfaction while watching it fly out the window.
:D
brony gamer that watched animes (changed to mangas though)
I know
Gah that camera...going everywhere
Alchemist yeah I'm fine, although schoolö is killing me :/ I hope I won't have to repeat this year... even though it just started, but so far things weren't going so well :/
Derp
im happy im out of school <.< hated it
haha, just take a break and come back to it later
looks like ded
im happy as a programmer^^
Fook.
Purple_Edge, I just leftz school and now I have to attend a vocational school :(
I would Kerbal mutliplayer would be...
So much chaos
Sometimes it's better to step away for a bit and come back with a fresh mindset.
*wonder
good idea
hi
ahhh
One disadvantage to teaching math?
Lil_B: same here. I skipped quite many seminars already because the research Im doing requires me to make base solutions at the university then travel an hour to the hungarian science academy because they have the instruments...
You know when you're being screwed on pay.
Purple_Edge, do you program RPGLE? :D
vocational school is a school that prepares you for the apprenticeship for a job?
i think?
indeed it is
Purple_Edge yup
na.... PHP java html mostly... even though i also learned COBOL
Purple_Edge I'm "out of school" too, but I'm, in sdchool again to become a Technichian in the fiel of chemistry
what is COBOL?
So how do you know if your playing properly if theres no way to "Win" this game?
technician in the field of chemistry?
you gonna get da cyborgs
hehe
COBOL is the second oldest programming language.... is procedural and involves a looooooot of text
lol
although I would have preffered Programming or Computer Science, but there is 0 chance to learn that around here :/
Hello, everyone. How are you all today? :)
so this borderlands I assume?
/me hugs AJIsAwesome :)
Hey Aj
hai AJIsAwesome
like 2+2=5 is in cobol CALCULATE 2 AND 2 SUM or somehow like that... been a while
I'm happy i got one of the only programmer jobs around here... I have to drive 100km a day though
Purple_Edge Chemichal technical assistand actually... has not much to to with technic actually, just normal chemistry :/
/me hugs CCCP SpadeMagnes[School] and Dken2021 :)
no wait, don't think it's borderlands
I played alot of Mischief Makers last night
=/
dont know how its called
whats this then?
haha
Lil_B: this is the desk I got at the uni to make the solutions: http://i.imgur.com/Xvvtl.jpg
My phone is being stupid
na in german its "chemiker" and i dont know how its in english... wait gonna go to translate.google
"chemist"
chemistrayter? :D
Lil_B: and this is the instrument I have to travel for every goddamned day: http://i.imgur.com/1Ghgi.jpg
yeah sounds.... easy
oh yeah, chemist :D
I miss my Kirby 64 game...
kirby 64?
...seriously, how hard is is to stay connected over wifi?
get an N64 emulator
and download the game
Poyo \:3/
yea Alchemist, yea science!
hi LadyCanary
Or I could get the Kirby collection
Alchemist man, these pictures are big, and my connection is currently very slow again, gonna take a short while to load :P
Sometimes connections are evil like that...
d
Lil_B: and I though my phone makes crap pictures :D
More voices.
"you should not run at people with guns"
Betrayed!
the more you know
oh my god haha
yay friendly fire
http://media.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/photo/9896462-standard.jpg
I used to deal with that all the time with a cheap wireless card.
hawt cheesus?
i want some
all dem bloons
Alchemist well... I don't wanna sound mean, but you can get a 2Megapixel picture in really bnad quality if the lense setting isn't good :P
Im never sure if Kirby is adorable or terrifying
Maybe it's the app's fault
....He is.
both
That is all.
kirby is an evil pink blob that eats every living being it comes across to gain its power
its a fckn demonspawn
Auugh wtf
He commited mass genoside BECAUSE HIS PIECE OF CAKE WAS STOLEN
Do not fuck with Kirby
^
*cide
Correction: He is an adorable pink puff from the stars and he wants to save everyone by eating everything.
:D
And he says POYO :3
Lil_B: well, there arent that many options to select on my phone besides the scheme (meaning portrait/night/scene etc setting)
>implying the digested things in his innards can be rescued
how do we know Kirby is a he?
Now that I think about it..why the fuck did the Squeak Squad steal his cake anyway?
on the outside, he looks cute and child-like mentality, but kirby is the most darkest videogame character ever
Because they're a group of thugs, SpadeMagnes[School]
you jokin? mario is the most evil
Also kirby seems to cause more problems than he helps
Okay, let's see if that fixed it
he is overweight... breaks everyones neck.... destroys every building... takes shrooms... shoots fire
He unleashed several eldritch creatures
Purple_Edge ever played kirby 64? know shiver star? It was earth after a nuclear fallout
Sorry for all the quit messages guys
....Mario isnt overweight =_=
WARIO is
No worries.
no i never played any kirby :D
haha no worries
you ever played wario land 3?
Invi wow, 100km ... If I would have choosen a radius like this I might have found a place... put well... Maybe I'll switch iin the future if chemistry isn't my style (althoug I do like it) ... I'm 21 when I finish this apprentenceship and about 25 when I'm done studying, I still have plenty of time to do everything I want... god pless our education system :)
wario is the good guy
/me glares at androirc
...WREK PLS <3
LadyCanary, just because he eats Waluigis food >.>
How many times has DeDeDe been good?
/ text wall end]
wario works his ass off to get the treasure from the evil guys.... then he gets the treasure and mario comes with a helicopter and fckn steals it after the last boss
SpadeMagnes[School]: The first game?
well good in his own standards
He was good in Nightmare in dreamland...
Good as in he wasnt a dick
Lil_B, 50 kim hin unn 50km zurück ^^
SpadeMagnes[School]: What about 64?
Lil_B, and Chemistry is awesome ^^
^
I found it funny the first person kirby asumes stole his cake was DeDeDe
11,02What about 64? o3o
SpadeMagnes[School]: Me too. :D
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: :O
also the boss room seemed based on the anime
NewSuperBronyU: You're supposed to be asleep. :P
/me glomps AJIsAwesome
heard about o3o but well
:O
11,02sleepies tiem is over :3c
i dont have a N64 never had
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU :3
11,02\:3/
was PS1 guy
NewSuperBronyU Well just look at the time!
It's time for bed!
11,02ikr O3O
:3
Good morning NewSuperBronyU :3
11,02What? D:
I still wonder what Zero is supposed to be in the Kirby universe
11,02LadyCanary: Chirp ^-^
SpadeMagnes[School]: Intergalactic demon?
Tweet tweet :3
kirby's conscience?
/me flies over to NewSuperBronyU and nestles in his mane.
do you remember when the chat was quiet for 2 minutes? petridge farm remembers....
11,02I'm broadening mah foreign language background /)u(\
11,02Mah head feels funny now O.O
Well... I think Dedede was only a Jerk in Dreamland 1, Gourmet Race, and the Kirby Golf Game... every other games he was mostly just possessed ... (or wanted to safe the star rod from Kirby in Kirby's Adventure)
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
/me hugs Lil_B back :D
11,02NiGHTS into Dreams... is out today on Xbox 360 \:D/
nights into dreams?
what genre is that?
NewSuperBronyU: Nice.
11,02Purple_Edge: Fun O3O
11,02Yesh
11,02Actually
NewSuperBronyU Your funny feeling head is not from those cleaning products.
Nope.
11,0215 years ago :)
Not from them.
I still need to get SA2 Battle. :O
even better :P
Also the reason Meta Knight wanted to take over dreamland was horribly butchered
Haiyo NewSuperBronyU!
11,02Hai ImOkayWithThis| :D/
OCRemix made an Album of Night Intro Dreams last year... but it was extremly repeditive in my opinion :/
well i was just buying some games today... 4 to be exact...
11,02I'm going out for nomz O3O
with one of them i will destroy any piece of logical thinking i have left in my brain
No drink?
Cya NewSuperBronyU.
Bye, NewSuperBronyU. :3
/me leaves while still carrying LadyCanary in his mane
I disapprove of this.
Bon appetit NewSuperBronyU! :P
bye
i think my brain wont be the same after playing saints row 3...
ooh, he got you there Wrek
I do hope the next kirby game brings back stuff like Leaf and Water
Alchemist your laboratory looks a little bit older than the ones I've seen so far :P buit you use the same Keyboard as our School :O
I#m still waiting for the Collectiion to come to Amazon in germany >.<
WAIT i just came across an interesting thought...
At least I still have Mists of Pandaria to occupy me
about 70% of all of equestria is female .... 2 ponies are needed for one foal....
so 30% male means
Lil_B: well, the university is broke and we use archaic methods and materials, and the other picture with the pc and the instrument is NOT at my university, its at the national science academy which granted me permission to use the instrument.
They're playing Friday on the school radio station
every male has to make more than 3 kids .... or the ponyrace will die
XD
Purple_Edge there was a comic explaining this
Purple_Edge, but in canterlot, almost all the guards are male
really?
Purple_Edge: don't bring logic in cartoonland :D
I do it anyway
lol
Majorly for faults in logic
Partyin' partyin' yeah!
Like Celestia sendins 6 mortal ponies to get rid of a dragon with out any fucking guards....
*sending
well they are the elements of harmony
Magic doesnt do shit against a dragon
if i had a spniper rifle. i would win
elements > guards
SpadeMagnes[School]: You sure about that?
he got a no-scope no-scope ~
taoumi: >implying dragonscales arent tough as shit
SpadeMagnes[School]: what good the guards were at any time during the show?
it
's a song
Alchemist oh, understandabale, school usually don't have great equipment, my school is in the middle of renovations (the first since the 70's ... at least the walls were colorful --.-) and we now have some nice new rooms to do our chemistry work :)
SpadeMagnes[School], it's equestria, where Vendigos come and kill everything when you are a bitching around >.>
Pew pew.
Hello guys
i think the guards are less defending equestria against evil superpony problems....
Hi, XylemTube. :)
hay XylemTube ^^
i think they are more like the ponypolice
Yes... be happy or else shit goes wrong
ponyce!
This game looks fun
hio
hi
so Shizu is playing planetside too ?
Equestria! Happiest place around...
Purple_Edge: exactly, the goddess sisters are the big cannons
well if they would move their ass for once
if the problem is little... its get shoved off to the guards...
if its medium it gets tossed to mane 6
if its extreme they aint do shit cause elements > princesses (watch discorD)
And all those times Celestia did jack all to help
And what does the (demi)goddess do?
she rules
Purple_Edge: they were in a one-day vacation :D
Purple_Edge: if she rules, what does the mayor do?
i mean celestia didnt even TRY to solve the ridle with the elements... she just left
mayor :)
I have a intense hatred/dislike for Celestia, because she never fucking does anything
:D
Purple_Edge: she thught it was obvious :D
Wow shes just like Obama! ... sorry had to say it.
the mayor is pointless since the diversion of might is only common in legislativ , executive and judicative
since that isnt canon in equestria since its a dictatorship
the mayor is only a speaking point to the princess
technically its a theocracy
Purple_Edge: the mayor is the local law representative
*whispers* it's a cartoon, don't overthink it...
Also ^^^^^^
youre right.... she once ordered some guards around
Dken2021: I know, just having fun :)
Dken2021: Exactly. :S
but a mayor shouldnt have the right to order guards around
And the one time she does anything she gets her ass handed to her...
No wonder I like Luna more...
SpadeMagnes[School]: I like both princesses equally :I
^
its funny to overanalyze things of cartoons and discuss
true
I love both too
it is fun
lets walk into another theme.... magic in nonpegasi....
for all this time I thought that someone was standing besides wrek and it was a goddamned jacket all along :D
Alchemist: Really? :D
Alchemist: :D
yes...
the portals and porting and spawning of items and foretelling of immediate reactions....in other words: pinkie pie
Alchemist: It's okay. :P
Also Earth ponies have super strength more than other ponies right>
Alchemist: the other one talking is Sumica silly
Purple_Edge: Pinkie secretly has hidden portals all over Equestria.
in case of portal emergency
i know
it is assumed SpadeMagnes[School], at least to balance them out
Purple_Edge: Well, I wasn't going to say that.
Also insane skillz at growing crops
Applejack in the iron pony competion is a hypocryte then
but you obviously made a reference to season 2 episode 23 i think
me?
ah
xD
RD can demolish a barn and Rarity lifted Tom
was it 23?
Purple_Edge: Unintentionally. :S
If she gets to use her strength, then she bitches about rainbow using her wings
its 20
season 2 episode 20
just looked
While earth ponies moves trains all day all night
damn 3 episodes off
Purple_Edge: I was talking about how she's able to pull things and be anywhere out of just plain nowhere.
Its pinkie pie dont question it
yeah .... where do the portals come from?
SpadeMagnes[School]: well, AJ has strong legs, but it's RD that has strong forelegs. Ergo, flying is HAAAAX
Doesnt matter
MAGIC! I aint gotta explain shit.
maybe she made a portal to get a portal gun from portal but where did she get a portal to portal?
If APplejack can use her earth pony strength RD should be allowed to use her wings
yo dawg i heard you like portals... so we put portal in a portal so you can port while you port
PP suddenly used portal up at Spike's birthday
she has a portalgun
Again, Its Pinkie Pie dont question it
Purple_Edge: or offscreen teleportation skills :D
Purple_Edge: PP is a portal gun.... Directed by M. Night Shamalan.
na you get them on level 50... shes 44...
she cant have it
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbfldku5yN1r8uiq6o1_1280.jpg DAN VS IS BACK BABY
hi everypony :)
that sure is an interesting comic
he got bored
internet derped
Hi, thelonepony. :)
haai thelonepony
hi
or he stepped in one of pinkys portals
since they are stashed all over equestria
He's supposed to guard Tarterus...WHY WOULD HE LEAVE
humans in Equestria!
hi AJIsAwesome Dken2021 and Applejack2012
:)
inb4 balls
SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe they can elaborate a bit more on tartarus in s3
CrimsonPhoenix: Dan VS is second best show on the hub :)
i have another question that is a little more interesting... this will be a little longer post
What is in Tartarus anyway?
Hi guize!
MadSurge, that's nice to know
hi StinkomanFan
hey StinkomanFan
SpadeMagnes[School]: personally I'd love to see a bit more lore added and world building. I'd be very interested in the origins of discord for example.
tartarus explained through the greece mythology is the place beneath hell where the eviliest of evil reside... he guards it... means... something must have took his attention and encouraged him to leave
Hi, StinkomanFan. :)
Purple_Edge: Exactly.
this happening would have been mostly be caused by a prisoner from the prison
so when tartarus left
Oh boy, I hope my picks win for next Movie Night
he most likely would have left
BUUUUUTTTTT
he didnt
hi
Kalimah? o3o
So..Ponyville is.. STATIONED NEAR A PRISON FOR EVIL
hope my picks wins too
or chrysalis and the changeling nation were imprisoned in tartarus and escaped of it to come back in 5 episodes later
Purple_Edge hate to plot before you, but you're thinking the changelings were the reason it left it's post?
would fit into the timeline
oh, nmv
is everyone buying planetside or just finding beta keys ?
The fuck was Celestia thinking when they gave those settlers that land?!
I voted for Vertigo and Saw
OH SHIT!
i need to inform the princess.....
SpadeMagnes[School]: I had low real estate value. She was happy to get rid of it :D
Ponyville I used to think was a great place to live...now...not so much
wait wait wait..... so the changelings got divided all over equestria after the expecto patronum that shining armor + cadence casted....
they should be imprisoned in tartaurs...
British_people.gif
aww
If they survived the flight Purple_Edge
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpcj9x0TKT1qa601io1_500.gif
eeeeh
does that mean celestia will get a witchhunt on changelings started
to hunt and bring them back to tartarus?
Anyone play Metroid Prime 3?
Back
nope
wb ASoftFluffyThing :)
Most of them most likley died from impact
its mlp
no one dies
not even granny smith
/me hugs thelonepony
I haven't even played Metroid Prime 1 or 2.
:3
Correct me if I'm wrong but did Celestia put Discord's statue back where it was before?
i bet there will be an episode where granny smith dies....
Hearts and Hooves Day funeral and bones in A Dog and Pony Show
wasnt shown spade
Granny Smith's been dead for months.
the only character who dies in mlp so far is the bloke whose funeral the cmc crashes :D
I don't even know that Metroid Prime exist
just him standing there in ponyville as stone.... and celestia giving the mane 6 the starwars treatment
AJ, Big Mac, and Applebloom just won't admit it
I have to ask.... why would you keep the statue of a creature who cast the world into chaos..AND NOT DESTROY IT
alchemist it could be a testrun for an actual burial
maybe the coffin was empty
SpadeMagnes[School] seems kinda un sportsmanlike
Is it possible that the statue was just a sculpture and discord just took it's form?
because hes the GOD! of chaos
S2 happily ever after ending Discord turned to stone :D
SpadeMagnes[School]: smashing the statue will only release him.
Well the seal would have broke eventualy
Its just a game for the Wii
They could have banished him to the moon or sun or something
Maybe they could take Discord's Statue and bury it
to the moon!
SpadeMagnes[School] like that worked before
*Metroid Prime 3 is a game for the Wii, the first 2 were on the GCN.
there is a difference
Heading out for my walk. Be back during BMN. I'll be 10-15 minutes late as usual
SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering tthat he can teleport at will, I doubt that.
StinkomanFan: Duscord can teleport I think.
alright, seea J_E_Smith71
I doubt he can teleport out of space
i most likely think the princesses are eternal
cya later J_E_Smith71
Happy Friday everyone
SpadeMagnes[School]: he probably can, tis magic
another reference from s2 e 20
Hi FrostedPony
hi FrostedPony :)
happy friday to you too FrostedPony
hoi FrostedPony
hi
Hi, FrostedPony! :)
frostedPony throwing out the big references
Hey FrostedPony!
hehe, he killed the medic
Also the fact one tiny argument set him free seems stupid
is this FPS starcraft?
ah
Spoilers: On December 23rd 2012 Celestia will arive and try to teach humanity about friendship
Maybe the seal was about to break anyway
i wouldnt call it ceal
seal
i would call it "sleep"
FrostedPony iirc, it is Planetscape
...Fifteen minutes later she just nukes humanity and moves on
no metroid fans I see :P
dont you wake up when a pan of bacon is fried right next to you?
StinkomanFan, I shall begin preparing for the coming of Celestia
celestia deliberately put a weak seal on discord so that he would be freed and the mane 6 would have to fight him. she is putting them through tests to make them stronger, so one day she may steal their power
I'm still hinging on the thought that the CMC should be punished for releasing the god of chaos
then she will rule as eternal empress
SpadeMagnes[School]: Hmm. How should they be punished?
Same for Snips and Snails for bringing a fucking Ursa Minor into town
Juvie?
And how would Celestia get there powers?
celestia doesnt have control over the elements so ... a test needs to have a result that can also be emulated by the testgiver
Eat there hearts or something?
if twilight wouldve failed....
Doubt there's juvie in Equestria.
I haven't played it, so I don't know if I like it
discord would be unstoppable....
StinkomanFan: and brains
WON MY FIRST FB GAME LAS T NIGHT!!!!
means it was no test
Im not a hearless bastard to have them killed. but they should be punished for almost destroying equestria
Bunny_Striker: Nice. :)
The series started on the NES
well, have fun all with the Movies (especially the B-Movie ... it can be kinda Goofy as far as I remember it) ^^ see you all tomorrow
SpadeMagnes[School]: I can understand that.
having a juvie in equestria is like having a jail in Tazmily village, there would be no use
so... who`s streaming?
Wrek.
oh
k
Dken2021 I love you for the reference
:3
how do people get to stream?
i play L4D 2 a lot :)
how come that the CMC's quarrel woke discord instead of the Windigos?
Why do i feel like the ticket master episode was a friend ship test?
FrostedPony: With the right equipment.
Because they're moderators, FrostedPony
i played l4d2 alot too
have about 300 hrs in it
its the only semi modern game i play
SpadeMagnes[School]: it was celestias fault mostly, there wouldve been enough chaos on day to break it anyway
So, where do you think the CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS will be fifteen years from now?
I'm actually rather aware of the Metroid series because my younger brother is into it.
hello everypony!
StinkomanFan: somewhere
I imagine the same prison cell Ed, Edd, n Eddy'd be in.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe because they were thinking for themselves instead of each other?
hi NENUDJUS :3
Hi, NENUDJUS. :)
applebloom will be a carpenter
hai NENUDJUS
I still dont get why you have the prison of the god of chaos on display and not locked away somewhere
sweetie belle will have a tour with saphire shores
SpadeMagnes[School]: Humility?
Also Discords personality caused his downfall
SpadeMagnes[School]: prisons cant be decrative?
SpadeMagnes[School]: mlp isnt really brilliantly writter plot-wise
I'm going to go sleeping, so bye
If he just kept the elements he would have won
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe teach him a moral lesson because of his chaotic decisions?
night
Instead, he played a game
scootallo will (incapable of flight) have the dream to be "the fastest running pony"
Later Blako!
And that caused him to lose
I could do a full play through of every Sonic The Hedgehog game for Sega Genesis.
yay internet lag :\
SpadeMagnes[School]: That's because he likes to play games. It's fun to him.
sonics cool
GOTTA SPEED KEED
brb
SpadeMagnes[School]: He wanted a challenge, probably.
k
yeah gotta go fast!
gotta go real fast!
CHILI DOGS CHILI DOGS CHILI DOGS
thats no good!
Gotta Buzz Cuzz
SpadeMagnes[School]: well hes just chaotic, he probably enjoys more of a chaotic plan more than a calculated one
If discorded ponies are their opposite personality, why was Big Mac a dog?
way past cool!
Think about it, if you just took over the world without any opposition, that would be boring right?
Bring the chat back to life: Check
My theory is that he switched bodies with Winona, SpadeMagnes[School]
SpadeMagnes[School] maybe it's different effects for other ponies
SpadeMagnes[School] because he's secretly the Smartest pony in Equestria?
WAZZAAAAA
I did find Granny dancing amusing
yo EEVERSTI
dragonesque...
Hi, EEVERSTI. :)
Ive been catching up on my sleep lately so I'm feeling better :)
Nice!
movie night in 2h eh?
so a discorded angel would be a nice guy and the douchebag he is normally?
EEVERSTI: hello
*not
EEVERSTI at least, yea
what game is they playin
good evening
hey angel is no douchebag.... hes just a little spoiled
Planetside 2.
Purple_Edge: Exactly.
ooohhh.... i made many enemys with that statement
sup Applejack2012
I have to ask, whats the point of having the elements under lock and key if the bad guys can fucking always access them
they cant
ANGEL NEEDS TO BURN IN A FRIENDSHIP FIRE
I'm fine
keep in mind
angel is a douche, hes not spoiled. he cares for fluttershy though
discord is a GOD
not every enemy is a god...
Fire of our friendship
Because hes spoiled, he's used to getting what he wants. When he didn't, he got angry and hit Fluttershy.
discord and Spike make a cute couple.
angel is like a hardcore mean guardian of fluttershy
SpadeMagnes[School]: Like I said, Discord can teleport anywhere he wants.
FrostedPony: ... *getting sunglasses off* what have you done?
:)
I think angel is mean because he tries to get Fluttershy to toughen up
Just my theroy
i'm so happy now. exam week ended 2 days ago
hm, yeah, he was spoiled in that ep. so i guess hes spoiled too
Since Discord broke free, he btoke in and stole the elements.
*theory
*broke
*star
then hundreds of Discord wedding fics
And apperently Changling were able to fill the entire room in the finale...
i bought a new laptop a few days ago. Out of the box it had 81 background processes running. After uninstalling all the bloatware and disabling some stuff in msconfig i have 38 background processes running.
So guys, what are we watching/talking about?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Well, it is a big hall.
and lots Pinkie Pie Discord arts
SB o_o
:3
jojoyasmin: Lore in MLP.
THATS IT
So what, they just all whent int there and waited?
pinkie pie <3 discord
o_o
Hell no.
._.
00,03I just got into a Batman conversation with a cutie! All is god in the world~
lol the pinkie x discord pic
I saw this picture of Discrod feeding a fat Pinkie Pie with Chocolate rain.
:D :D :D DOHOHOHOH Scoots~
all is god?
everything is god?
that would mean i am god
I'm still not gonna be satisfied untill Celestia gives a apology to Twilight for doubting her
00,03Yes, allis god >_>
wait wait wait wait
my toilet is god, i knew it!
celestia and luna are princesses
http://gyazo.com/a0422cd3a9b5e30e64eee3a60d68493c I'm designing some monster for my mlp comic. What do you guys think? :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe she will in later seasons.
they are no "gods"
so when discord is the GOD of chaos
shouldnt there be a GOD of order?
You know what would be awesome? Having a urinal in your bedroom.
00,03anyway, afternoon', y'all~
Scoot-Scootaloo, attracting all the ladies
EEVERSTI: It's nice. :)
That would be so convienent.
Scoots, you so silly :3 what specifically did you talk about Batman-wise with her?
FrostedPony: But then you'l have the faint smell of pee. :S
FrostedPony: >implying the urinal wouldnt stink the shit outta your room
^
just clean it every once in awhile
:)
FrostedPony: Thinking about the stench...no, it wouldn't :D
The mane 6 tend to be victorlic friends
i could tag it on www.urinal.net
*victrolic
would you want to sleep besides your toilet?
Hai Dken2021
yay shakey network
Purple_Edge: What if... bear with me for a sec here... what if the toilet..is your bed?????
well as long as youre no hobo that seems rather unhygienic, unhealthy and uncomfortable^^
SpadeMagnes[School]: Well, they aren't exactly perfect. :S
hi
WOOT I LIKE EASTER EGGS
who else!!!!!!!!!!!
hai ASoftFluffyThing
If they were perfect friends, they would be boring and dull. :S
I love trains!
I know but they sometime dont really act like friends would
when i was 10 years old i tried sleeping in the bathtub with a blanket.
FAIR ENOUGH
choo choo
Alchemist: Well then... i think that *puts sunglasses on* you will have some wet dreamsn
it was comfortabl for awhile.
YEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHH
:D
Your bed's right next to your toilet! And you get free knives all the time! PRISON IS FUCKING AWESOME!
SpadeMagnes[School]: So they shouldn't give into their inner flaws, just like humans would? :S
StinkomanFan, free knives?
Hello everyone, how are we doing
Shanked
Hi, Darkts3|Protoss|MLG. :)
hai Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG :)
hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG ^^
hi
and what are we watching today :)
You have to make your shanks in prision, they're not free.
Hi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
hoi Darkts3|Protoss|MLG
gotta sharpen your sporks.
hi Invi :)
sometimes i wonder why i get kicked from channels but hey.. Hiya everypony
hai thelonepony ^^
KickMe: its a mystery
hi KickMe
hey KickMe
hi KickMe
you just got trolled
I have never ever used or even seen a spork irl.
So what are we watching?
you just said that you wanted to get kicked
they have sporks at taco bell.
SPORKS ARE THE FUTURE
FrostedPony gasp!
Wrek playing Planetside II
damn, thats Wrek?
Tonight we're watching GHOST BUSTERS
mmhmm
hi
Yes :3
Aint he cute? o///o
i imagined him to be a little gothy, xD
SpadeMagnes[School]: The fact that they do this makes them more relatable to human beings, which is why we can relate to them very well. There is no such thing as a perfect friend. Everyone has flaws.
Sporks are the most exotic inventions of all of ponykind
....Why Darkts3|Protoss|MLG XD
Twilight seems to be the only one who knows when things are suspecious..
thus he was kicked
LadyCanary: mebe the way he acts xD
wait do they even have sporks in ponyville?
or do the eat everything with they magnethooves?
He...doesnt act goth o_o
You would think the Princess of love acting bitchy....would raise questions...
Wut.
00,03Playing Sporks....
Purple_Edge: have you seen anypony eat with silverware?
hi Scoot-Scootaloo :)
Sporks are fuckin' awesome
allo scoots
hi Scoot-Scootaloo
Alchemist: silver spoons cutie mark?
i saw them eat with their hooves that somehow have a process in their mids that produces gravity
Has anypony heard the theme for Skyfall?
good evening
Alchemist: nvm
oh lol
twilight_sprinkle: but have you seen actually anypony use it?
they obviously can controll the gravitational force to let it stream out on one side of their hoove
The fuck kind of cutie mark is a spoon?
to a straight line
I like to think That Celestia kidnaps anypony who makes a new invention and takes all the credit for it.
NOVEMBER!!
they obviously dont need silverware
also hi
Alchemist: (chats moving fast so i misread), but im not sure, i thiiiink i mightve
hai rdibp
Hi rdash
Hi rdibp
and yes they have
Hi rdibp
Hi rdibp :)
hoi rdibp
hi
cutiemarc chronicles....
AJ
Manehatten
"should i take the salad gable" n stuff
hold on my internet is all crudy
fork*
oh crap, i forgot i havent even voted
but she didnt use it
Silver Spoon's talent is Ettiquiet. It's actually a Soup Spoon she has
I read that as cuddly instead of cruddy XD
The apple family founded Ponyville right?
Yes.
eeyup
but it would be pointless to put that stuff on the table without the intent to use or to decorate anything.... its not one of pinkies partys...
3 fruit roll-ups left
So how are they fucking broke?
thus the drawfriend has an awesome header! http://derpy.me/7CxW-
Sick!
awwww survey is no longer available :<
hello again ^^
ALSO! I took a field trip to an Apple Farm today
:O
they are broke because filthy rich is buying all the jelly and apples for absurdly low prices
hmmm, so basically Planetside 2 is Battlefield 3 in the future
and reselling them more expensive
You would think the family that made Ponyville and their main food source would be semi wealthy
so they only got minimal incoem from that + their own sellings in the market
but who would want apples?
haha hey
It... wasn't as whimsical as it was opn the show. :(
Purple_Edge: Interesting theory. I like it.
But doesnt most of his profit coem from zap apples?
the money that would belong to the apples rightly belongs to filthy...
SpadeMagnes[School]: and cider
apples, apples
the only things he does is buying cheap stuff and selling it more expensive
he aint doin shit for his money....
SpadeMagnes[School]: Apples and apple accessories (no joke intented).
Purple_Edge: welcome to the business world :d
Come back to stream, still Planetside. Are they winning yet?
is there even an economy in Ponyville? i have never seen something like Wall St. there,
So if The apple family even goes under, Filthy will too
goodbye work week, hello weekend, and HELLO BRONYSTATE
man i can barely hear Wrek
IRL people use ladders to harvest apples. Apparently because the pusses can't handle the PAIN
hai Derp_Derp /)
Hello Derp_Derp
hi
Have you ever tried to kick a tree?
back
ded
0,5Hello there guys
hi Derp_Derp
Go kick an appletree as hard as you can!
SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering how greedy filthy is, I doubt it. He'll probably mooch off anthor business in Equestria.
Hi BaconMane :3
hai BaconMane
Hi, BaconMane! :)
>implying the apples wouldnt fall out of the baskets
BaconMane! oh how I missed those bacon colors of yours, how's it going?
>implying the tree would live through such a hard shake that he looses all his apples
*magic*
I still love the fact Diamond is only rich beacuse of the Apples
howdy everypony!!!
>implying humans are strong enough
what about cider season?
Hi, Michael! :)
hai Michael
BRING ME BACK THE APPLES YOU KICKED OUT OF THE TREES,
That shut her smug ass up
Hi Michael
>implying the buck wouldnt destroy all the leaves
AND IF THEY AREN'T RAINBOW YOU FAILED
/me hugs AJIsAwesome Dken2021 thelonepony
way to shoot me down baconmane :<
They should make Zap apple cider
ji
/me returns the favor for Michael :3
SHIT JUST GOT REAL spade
:O I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
the thing is
/me steals Michael's favor
zap apples... are magical... they arent like normal apples
^^
Hello Everpony :)
Maaaaaaagic
:|
SpadeMagnes[School]: that would be the equivalent of vodka?
hi
hi Cypresswolf
i dont think they would be able to produce the alcoholic percentage for the cider
wat grm irs tis?
AJIsAwesome: filthy actually seemed liek a nice guy
ohai Cypresswolf
SpadeMagnes[School]: Considering that regular cider takes a lot of time to make, the apple must be right, and including the fact that Zap Apples aren't as plentiful as apples, it probably wouldn't sel well.
since they disapear after 1 day
man, everyone is saying hai today
Hi Cypresswolf. :)
how are things Cypresswolf
they dont have a aging process that diverses the fruit into a stinkin pile of mold
I doubt cider is alcoholic in the pony world
I just figured out where to start looking for a park job - Galveston! :)
with alcohol as a sideeffect
/me sends the police over rdibp
Purple_Edge: just distill it a few times :)
big suddenly wall of greetings
Cypresswolf: Nice! :)
Ohai :)
you can distill zap apples? you sure?
Berry Punch's dying liver would like to prove you wrong.
Well if they managed to make several barrels of cider in several minuets Im sure it wouldent take long to do the same with zap apples
"these arent like normal apples"
hai MaxTheBrony
Hi, MaxTheBrony. :)
SpadeMagnes[School] isnt it when foam forms at the top, is when its alchoholic?
hi
Heya Michael AJIsAwesome :) Applejack2012
Parents got that house on Tiki island, just before the bridge to the island, not far of a drive compared to what I usually drive on a daily basis
hi MaxTheBrony
/me breaks out of prison
Ohai thelonepony :)
wb Panda|Homework ^^
I could essentually stay there with minor expenses
SpadeMagnes[School]: Implyig that Zap Apple cider would work the samw way as Apple cider.
Wb Panda|Homework :)
^^
I have no idea, do I look like I know how pony cider works?
the thing is.... if they already have a process tha destinates their existence (the plop after a day) means they dont have a second one
/me hugs Applejack2012 forgot :3
wb
I`m eating spagehtti
Welcome back, Panda|Homework! :)
wb Panda|Homework :3
means they dont need to be able to mold
so this COULD MEAN
grouphug!
Bunny_Striker: LOTSA SPAGHETTI!
wb Panda|Homework
Wb Panda|Homework
/me hugz Applejack2012 :3
:O
The only downside I can think of that will be a major issue are Galveston's biker weekends
all the welcome backs :3
I still find that Zap apple joke on that comic I saw once funny
glad to be back XD
SpadeMagnes[School]: I know which one you're talking about. :D
You left?
we should get the zap apple jam to make a coup and take the power
I would LOVE to see RD's parents, though.
who thinks that ":3" needs an emoticon?
I also got to go to Walmart today and got Shiny Blindbag Pones :3
maybe his rule will be even better than celestias
AJIsAwesome: me too...
Michael: I think it's fine as it is.
StinkomanFan, wave 4?
guys
Androirc doesn't like anybody :p
Yes/
StinkomanFan: :O i need some too
*?
have you seen brony gangnam style?
yeah?
It was Trixie and Twilight Sparkle :)
So why does Rarity seem so radicaly different than her parents?
mentallyeffedguy: Yep.
to awesome :D
mentallyeffedguy: eeyup
inb4 adoption
AJIsAwesome: just for the lulz
Is that accent natural or just something she does?
StinkomanFan: i wish i were lucky enough to get trixie and twilight..
hello
raritys parents thought they couldnt produce a filly... so they got rarity and after a while they miraculously got one
SpadeMagnes[School]: Because not every child looks identical or sounds identical to their biological parents?
its the greatest thing ive seen in my entire life
mentallyeffedguy: blackgryphon got all the swag in that video
Well i mean the accent
I think most of the bikers on those weekends hang out on the northside of the island - and along the seawall - few travel south to the park
my money is that season 3 is going to premire on the 30th of November
I read some theory thing that Sweetie Belle was Rarity's daughter and Rarity told Sweetie to pretend that they were sisters so Rarity wouldn't have a bad name
Hey guys! What we looking at here?
you already lost your money rdibp
Michael: the navy guy was awesome
Or somethin like that. I don't remember
Crazy bastard mode
Her father sounds like he's from the pony equivalent of newyork
:(
Whats going on gusy!
Chaos... chaos everywhere in this game...
ASoftFluffyThing: lol wtf
mentallyeffedguy: that was blackgryphon
its Discord's doing
hub: " the earliest airdate possible is the 3rd... the latest possible date for it to air is the 20th"
Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne, milk for the Khorne flakes.
chocolate milk
Michael: well i dont know all the bronies, but he was awesome
Chocolate milk of glass
Meanwhile: :D
daww Jack just jumped on my lap :3
mentallyeffedguy: IKR
twilight_sprinkle, my reaction exactly. But I forgot where I read/saw it. It was about a year ago
november...but what year?/
You had the drop on a purple guy?
"it will be revealed atleast 30 days ahead"
Applejack2012: I LIKE CHOCOLATE MILK!!!
It's working fine for me
Thats why he killed ya.
TTA from pulsars right now is BROKEN
rdibp: jack?
I think it's her wifi
My dog
NIGHTMARE NIGHT'S COMING! You guys know what TF2's gonna do?
Is it confirmed Applejack's parents are deceased?
:o
SpadeMagnes[School]: Nope.
heyo all
Yeah, it probably is
:)
SpadeMagnes[School]: Just a theory.
SpadeMagnes[School]: no idea
Hi, Queen_Chrysalis. :)
rdibp: i liek dogs
hai Queen_Chrysalis
We have yet to see Fluttershy's parents or Rd's
StinkomanFan: add a gabe newell hat?
Hi Queen_Chrysalis
I guess it's the wifi that doesn't like her then.
Those would be interesting episodes
lol
SpadeMagnes[School]: Agreed.
hi Queen_Chrysalis
THis arguement comes up like EVERY time with this game
are AJ's parents even mentioned in the series?
Gaben: Level 31 Hat
The future, we know nothing about balistics.
I want to see an episode where the CMC finally get their cutie marks
Alchemist: Nope. Not yet, at least.
That would be awesome.
Hahaha.
StinkomanFan: best hat is notch hat
That wont be for awhile
Barbetos|AtWork: in the future... everyone would screw logic
first things first..... they wont get their cutie marks all at once
ASoftFluffyThing: Me too, but it would eliminate the high jinks and the gags that make the CMC who they are.
Sweetie's is singing obviously..
In the future there are no ponies. T_T
AJIsAwesome, who says they can't get into hijinks when they have their cutie marks?
sweetie singing... applebloom handicraft.... scootalloo atheltic
Fat chance of Applebloom's not being being apple related
http://derpy.me/rbqvo This is one of the main reason why I love CosmicUnicorn
Barbetos|AtWork: dont say that, ponies will live on FOREVER!!
Bunny_Striker: except not really.
nop!
ASoftFluffyThing: I guess they could, but it would eliminate the purpose of the CMC.
All good things have an end
everything has an end.
http://i.imgur.com/Z9AjO.jpg mak it happen
You, everthing around you, everything beyond you.
ANd that too
Ponies are bound to exist forever like Hyroglyph exist
*make
Al the CMC gets Cutie Marks fics trashed
Barbetos|AtWork: what's your job kind sir?
Some things need to end, like Jersey Shore
AJIsAwesome, true. But I hoep they don't get rid of the voice crack Sweetie Belle has. That's just adorable.
Eventually all is nought but dust.
new ponies episode cannot be forever though
hi
You okay, Meanwhile?
forever...
ASoftFluffyThing: Oh, definitely. I love that crack in her voice. :D
hai puffmuffins
Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: IT.
Fable Journey is coming out in 4 days ^_^
ASoftFluffyThing, I have bad news
how are things puffmuffins
hi
well i just recently read a fanfic where applebloom got a "sledgehammer" cutymark... because her talent was to be a sledgehammer for a very very angry marine
hi puffmuffins :3
AJIsAwesome, voice crack whil singing <3
ASoftFluffyThing: My life philosophy not withstanding, yes.
CrimsonPhoenix, what happened?
ASoftFluffyThing: Even better. :D
Barbetos|AtWork: Whats your Job?
ASoftFluffyThing, Claire's voice matured a bit
I really don't know if she can do the crack now
CrimsonPhoenix, b-but...voice crack....
Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: Like computer repair, networking, etc. etc.
I feel sorry for Luna sometimes
false, there is no proven end to time, so everything will not be dust
Barbetos|AtWork: kewl, could you tell me how to configure my graphics card settingS/
CrimsonPhoenix, well hopefully she could sneak one in if it doesn't hurt her voice
MOON FOR THE LUNA GOD
False, you're a bellend and no one cares.
For?
She could re do the voice she had but the voice crack was unintentional
I wonder why Celestia didnt bother educating Luna about the changes in the past century
oh grats, you spelled it right this time
*resisting the urge to throw in the word that picollo says to gohan in DBZTAS*
Meanwhile, okay just checking. You're sorta mellow today :S
DOOOOOOOOOODGE
Barbetos|AtWork: for graphics, lol. mine is overclocked
nope
the other one
Neeeerd
yeah xD
Oh so what kind of graphics card do you have then?
Sooo yeah it would sound force in my opinion if she tries
CrimsonPhoenix, well best not force it in. We'll still love her though <3
Barbetos|AtWork: Nvidia Geforce 550-ti
>Your sister has been on the moon for 1000 years, don't bother education her on the changes
Purple_Edge: DODGE(BLOCK)!!
The hell celestia
lol
how long did it take for you guys to get the beta key after applying?
CrimsonPhoenix: who/what is cosmicunicorn?
SpadeMagnes[School]: Because she knew that luna's 14th century antics are adorable
Dovah, Luna vs the microwave
fire all the weapons
Progress is best Luna fic
Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: Okay. Do you have a machine you built or did you throw that into like an HP or Dell or soemthing?
ASoftFluffyThing: Microwave
Has Progress updated at all?
No idea
IDK, Luna's doing pretty well when it comes to VIDYA GAMES
mentallyeffedguy, You know that comic called Discordantly?
nope
Barbetos|AtWork: threw it in, and apparently it was made to be already overclocked kind sir
Bunny_Striker, microwave won that one.
i think every mosquito should have the chance of a fair trial before the mighty squashing that follows... because you never know if he did suck you or not
What's the guy's name on first base?
Last chapter I read was something about Luna being part of the space program for Equestria.
I have to ask, why did Celestia have a random statue of Nightmare Moon in the middle of the everfree forest?
microwave and laser became canon in S2
Cranberry_Scotch: whoi
CrimsonPhoenix: ill look at em all
I know that fanfic
with luna and spaceproject
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUSZv5ynuqA I'm loving this so much
SpadeMagnes[School]: royal budget
next TV in S3?
Purple_Edge, yeah that's the one!
Darkts3|Protoss|MLG: So it might already be overclocked. The cool thing about GPU's these days is that there is usually software that you can use to OC your config further.
oh for the love of shit
dats some drawing skills mate
SpadeMagnes[School]: need to spend the taxes on the something
and also a few more work from that person http://fav.me/d4u1vsb
SpadeMagnes[School]: Maybe not Celestia, but probably the vilagers. They probably did to remember people of Nightmar Moon.
00,03mentallyeffedguy: MLG Drawing skills*
Barbetos|AtWork: NO WAY
http://fav.me/d525g4r
But why in the middle of a forest?
Wrek: game crashed
General rule though is that an unstable clock will restart your computer, so you may have to tweak it to get it right
http://fav.me/d58mc3b
It is going to take a lot of trail and error
trial*
And in some cases you may even be able to look up youtube videos about the card you have
Scoot-Scootaloo: guess youre right, the drawrings look fuckin amazing
Barbetos|AtWork: well the problem is that i dont know where to go to in my Nvidia Control Panel
SpadeMagnes[School]: Because it would most likely garner attention like it should?
Really bored, anyone got any ideas?
there's a lot more in the gallery if you're curious
Meanwhile: yeah the chat is nearly dead no one writes anything
Why I do love CosmicUnicorn though
I an not that familiar with Nvidia software at the moment, but I bet it is in Basic mode, you might want to look for Advanced mode instead.
Meanwhile, none that I can think of. Besides minecraft >.>
WUT
is how he (or she) always explore in art, learning new stuff, techinics and all that
needs more chaos
i hope this was a joke
That person progress
i wouldnt mind if i had my key
but they wont give me one
If war were declared
*siren goes off*
unlike some artist that think they're great
after looking at all this art makes me wanna draw, but then again i know how terrible i am at it
^
mentallyeffedguy: Same here. :D
you want that cake?
I WANT IT
mentallyeffedguy, here's a tip
draw
you want that cake?
just draw
thats a good tip
I hate art classes for some reason...
dat laugh
do what you want and draw what you want
Wheres that chocolate cake?
ponies dammit!
you mean this chocolate cake?
/me glares
look up tutorial first to have some basic
like color and stuff
I want that cake
and draw
SpadeMagnes[School]: ITS A LIE!!!!!
guis
i want it
storm of chaos
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH TAADAAAAAAA
just keep on drawing
You have cake addiction
it's a bad habit
eventually you'll get good
It affects families everywhere
DashWithRainbows: What if I like pie more? :P
What would pony africa be called?
Well, it has fruit.

Plus...

Chicken pie is best pie.
Now turn to the left and park it
DashWithRainbows: Lemon Merengue? :(
Correction, chicken + veg + gravy pie is best.

twilight_sprinkle: sure
Except it blew his face off.
OLE

Wrek looks like one of classmates
If god give you lemons you FIND A NEW GOD! POWERTHIRST, GODBERRY! KING OF THE JUICE!

DashWithRainbows: youre damn right it doesnt block bullshit!

I should really play LoL a bit more.
nope
http://na.leagueoflegends.com/news/visual-upgrade-twisted-fate-card-master
i dont played MW3 so i dont have an opinion of that, but by the people who talks about it...
this is a different game dude duh
Athgaar: something better than CoD
this is the beta for black ops 2
My Kirby fanboyism is upset at Gamegrumps
:S
GreasyEthan: Yes?
besides i already preorded black ops 2
the only CoD i ever played was the demo of the first game
Moo: no it isnt
if mw3 doesn't mean modern warfare 3, then what is it
Oh my god.
any ponies in it?
They gave him Gangnam Style.
GreasyEthan: You were saying?
Have to admit, it looks a bit like Halo.
Uuuuuuuuuu.
Mega Warden 3?
/me still remembers when CoD was a good game
That sounds like an epic game.
DEEED
whats today's movie?
Eat a platypus Monkey
Moo: And Halo looks like Marathon. :3
Michael: It's still a good game D:
Moo, yeah also reminds me of T:A

Nittany_Discord: Well nice to see you though, mah fav mod
Well, the remodel looks good at least.

Now he looks cool instead of deformed.
I am upset
Ok theres like a couples M's i see
11,01Thanks. *Hugs cuddly_kittehs*
i'm wondering if there are any pony mods for tf2
Cowvarkian: The sad thing is, CoD is for the Xbox as well as Halo, so it has no correspondence of argument.
remember PS1 and old PCs thelonepony?
CrimsonPhoenix: Maybe because they're not that into Kirby?
11,01shogipony: Yes.
shogipony: yup
not that much Michael
thelonepony: when the first CoD was released
AJIsAwesome, still upsets me
11,01I always play on a TF2 server with pony mods.
I have to go, dad wants to use BronyState now.
salmon is way better then cod
CoD is OK but nothing special
Nittany_Discord: love that servers
Nittany_Discord: Cause your awesome XD
tf2 is way better then Cod :D

Sergio_Scriptor: SPEAKER OF THE TRUTH!
I am looking forward to Black Ops 2

Sergio_Scriptor: and FREE
11,01TF2 is a better team game than CoD.
Sergio_Scriptor: I only play CoD for the single player....
XylemTube: CoD sucked when black ops came out
hmmm cool
^
and yes TF2 is awesome
oh you youngsters, i remember playing counter-strike 1.6 in school

Michael: they are for MILF
lol
theres no i in mlf
yeah, little mistake :D
i otakon
having played both i agree
11,01You can't lone wolf as almost any of the classes in TF2.
sry
hiya SafariMonkey
*hi
Nittany_Discord: Yup. Free, full teamwork, awesome charters, well earned weapons with advanges and disavages, and classes with CLASS!
11,01Maybe Pyro.
TF2 is MUCH more creative, fun, and unique that CALLS OF DUTIES
do I hear Chrysalis playing?
mentallyeffedguy: wut
Hi, otakon. :)
Michael: they are for MILF`s
My little MILF ;)
hiya
o_o

[yro is my personal fav
o.o Why Is Command And Conquer BGM Playing?
Michael: yes
Applejack2012: nit sure if trying to turn me on..
Nittany_Discord battlefield i better team game than CoD
Laurayne: Because it's awesome? :3
pyro i mean
Because C&C has an awesome soundtrack.
00,03Ninja'ing commencing~
TF2 is for teamwork
11,01I can do some damage as a Pyro with Phlog.
Nittany_Discord: Wait, no. Pyro can't. In most cases, he/she is an assistant to killing, as the best tac. is to set them on fire then go to the next person. They just wear away some health for the rest of the team
Battle feild 3 gets me so mad
Transformers four is coming
Yeah the whole Kirby Superstar series of Gamegrumps upset me
Its supposed to be about Unicron
GreasyEthan: really?
CrimsonPhoenix: why ? :|
yeah
11,01Yeah. I play Pyro as hit-and-run.
Yup
This Is BGM For Command And Conquer Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge
GreasyEthan: I don't want
Megatron comes back as Galvatron, too
11,01Unless I'm ubercharged or have a full MMMPH meter with the Phlog.
Jon forcing of being an idiot
Nobody does
Laurayne: did you get kicked?
i really liek playing spy with eternal reward
Its a stupid redo of the cartoon
Michael: yes
SKIPPING A WHOLE LEVEL IN GREAT CAVE OFFENSIVE
Nittany_Discord: I only kill a little more because i die more ofen in the less used stragey: Kamakzi!Pyro
Mfw LoL
Kicked?
Laurayne: ok nvm
Twiligt_sprinkle: Hai
... Mispelled
CrimsonPhoenix: well,they are just doing it for fun ,keep that in mind :\
Oh, Nittany_Discord!
hoi GreasyEthan , use tab to autocomplete names btw
Nittany_Discord: I lost all faith in Cartoon network when they made ANNOYING ORANGE a show.
11,01Hi RaveBrony.
well yeah but still I'm not entertain very much
Kthx
Are you free tonight?
CrimsonPhoenix: true i guess :\
i like pyro because even though i suck in games like tf2 i can do pretty well

They need an episode where Trixie gets her head run over.
You know who wont be pleased if thats made a reality :D

my brain hurts
SPAMMING

I think equestria daily is doing their TF2 thing right now
they aren't pony related though
BaconMane: how do you keep yourself from eating your mane?
pinkiespice, i just confessed to my dad after a year of being a brony. Now everpony knows i am one.
Not telling them
DeadpoolDash: doing a server?

mentallyeffedguy: my mom was looking at me like i was metal when she thought i was one >_>
i told my friend and made him a brony. My dad said he would just make fun of me once in a while (we joke to each other all the time) and everyone else is k with it so i dont have to hide anymore :)
that i might be one
What about fimfiction?
DeadpoolDash: ikr

pinkiespice: she knew what a brony was?
As interesting as this interview is, I think I might head off for a short while.
:) twilight is my favorite piny she is nice and kinf
no, but she thought i liked my little pony a little too much

Nittany_Discord: how do you know
That sounds... boring.
11,01Experience maybe.
power lvls are pointless
Nittany_Discord: that may be true
if you think the game is bad,you should see "My little dashie: the clopfic" :'( why did they made that
Sergio_Scriptor: ........WUT :S
DeadpoolDash: that as well
hai sonicandmario85
cause rule 64

:'( some one said i have long tail extion
AJIsAwesome: it's terrible :'(

when my dad put them in the cage they were peeping alot and then at 5:00 they shut up XD
robotdragon9: you said a caramel APPLE not peanuts on the apple
so sad, I burst into treats
ITS BOTH
robotdragon9: unless you're allergic to peanuts
the 20 years of Cartoon Network animations are pretty neat
DeadpoolDash: indeed
DeadpoolDash: It was. Just wish it was the same again.
cowvarkian:i liek peanuts...
then CN turned into, well u know
AJIsAwesome: thenwe would have nothing new?
*then we
Oh I read Past Sins
cowvarkian: I mean in terms of being original and well made.
I may hate the fanfic and the praise it gets
but the author is pretty cool
Idea for a fanfic: Jay Sherman watches My Little Pony
It's actually quite an adrenaline rush
moral of the day?
CN nostalgia bomb
Hate the fanfic not the author
I wish I had two screens, that way I could play Dark Souls AND spam the chat at the same time.
i remeber when i had idea for naruto fanfiction
AJIsAwesome: well, I dislike a majority of cartoon network shows, but the ones I like are made by the same producers, designers, etc as the old cartoons I liked...
/me was mad for the ending
Hi everypony
Hi, CrazyHippie. :)
hai CrazyHippie
Why did I get kicked?
Hi AJIsAwesome
I did nothing
Wassup Michael
GreasyEthan: because you displeased the gods
CrazyHippie: Why would you spam the chat anyways?
*mods
lol already too late.... after uploading my story in fimfiction it got destroyed with like 1 upvote and 12 downvotes.... i took it down and got depressed <.<
where nawaki wasn't really killed, but death was faked my orchimaru to be for expermientation
There is always the popout button brlow the chat, Crippler
AJIsAwesome: When did I spam the chat?
I was idle for twenty minutes
CrazyHippie: WHOOPS. Meant for Crippler.
GreasyEthan: your point?
CrazyHippie: Sorry. :$
Purple_Edge: next time there will be more luck
Purple_Edge: never surrender
idk
maybe maybe....
I just look at the tab and I find I've been kicked for advertising
AJIsAwesome: I will never forgive you! :P
CrazyHippie: Sorry. :(
I got over 12 downvotes on fimfiction too
dat Rainbow dash
AJIsAwesome: All is forgiven...
its positive, except when it isnt
CrazyHippie: Yay. :)
Yes we are awesome
indeed
^^
wow that was short
hopefully pizza will arrive before the movies
CrazyHippie: Though we shouldm't overglorify ourselves.
*shouldn't
AJIsAwesome: yes....sure
Really? That's quite surprising. Maybe I don't have the right being bored technique... Because when I'm bored, it's boring...

Can I give my opinion of MLD?
Meanwhile: Sure.

It takes alot of skill to not be bored when you're bored. I've been practicing for years.
Dunno, usually when I share my opinion of interview guests I get told off.
Hey everyone!

Ok, later!

what is it called?
Zuxxez123: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Rick and Harold are all really strong improv comedians, and I strongly suspect that the original movie had a lot of improvised dialogue. The sequel was overwritten by being written

Now if you swear, it's automatically a higher rating. I blame the Soccer moms.

...Okay, besides Howard the Duck, but that movie's horible.
VenHur: instead of just.........random shit
I dont know the beginning XD
.... you know.... most phyics have two ablities (most common ones) A way of sensing ghosts, but this is reserved for thouse with a near-deadly issue, like need to sleep with a breathing tool. its only wispers though. And future predictions. i get thouse; short moments/images that appear in your dream the night before, that is random and you cant' always remeber: pointless de'juvu when you encouter thouse imagies and moments.
That score

that....was a scary wall of text.

Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg!

Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!

RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the DVD commentary, Ivan Reitman says he received a call from William Atherton complaining that the movie ruined his life. The character of Walter Peck was so hated that people would talk Atherton as if they were giving the character Peck a piece of their mind. Apparently more than once, physical fights had been started with Atherton in bars.

Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!
