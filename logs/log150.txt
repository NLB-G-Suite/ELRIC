Happy happy joy joy!
twilight loves me they all do
I got glomped by them all
she didnt believe pinkie sense though
its proof
yes because she had no proof
and that was because of a magnet
the proof is that lasharus is here and his ship is leaving
doesnt count
who hides their wigs like that xD
but how do we know its lashes?
and how do we know they're on there?
