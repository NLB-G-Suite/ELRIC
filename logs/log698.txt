Too much to count?
Only one really comes to mind for Luna's protege

Um... NO
It could, but I'd prefer someone more well known in the show.
She would need to be a CHARACTER first

With a fiery passion.
The massive size and the stallign tactics people can abuse
Got to go everyone...to sleep.
Well this is wide open mostly

Great temple is pretty inclosed and blocked by walls
I never use items in my fights.

They have their ways
Sooo, Applebloom sucks at everything?
These are not characters that need to learn a great, life-changing lession-- they are fine as they are. That's kind of the point.

May I ask why it's called "fusion"
jazz fusion is more of an approach than an actual genre, or at least it was when it first came to light

during the 70s and such it was kind of like "lets take this weird instrument, and play some extended chords under it during an improvised solo"
