i shall go back to spying after i get unbanned >.>
Nitt's a dude, just so happens he has a pension for maid outfits
Unbanned from what? princess :3
my "Friends" joined a queen chrysalis group so im spying
11,01Not severe enough that I actually wear them IRL though.
roblox 3:
Nittany_Discord: yet
RAWRity, I believe the word you meant to use is penchant?
they banned me for posting a animated picture
Not quite a Corporal Klinger, eh? :3
who doesn't like maid outfits? tho i must admit i prefer them at a fine female form
And this is the song I blast into my ears everyday while I'm at school http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FvXznPl1J8 I do it ALL DAY. But of coarse not in class :P
Roblox? similar to minecraft princess ?
Who's in the halloween spirit? http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/557703_886790098812_830110150_n.jpg

RAWRity: Oh myyyyy. She looks awesome ;3;
11,01Polydunami: No. Only here.

11,01RAWRity: Dunno.
yup
JASOOON

SHAWN
JAYSUN
shawn michaels?
No love for Shaun? :D
X
One day, you'll get a maid costume in the mail. You won't know who sent it, or where it came from, but you won't throw it out. You'll just toss it in the back of a closet, laugh it off, and tell us about it.
nopr
SHAWN!
Then as time goes on
i thought he meant Jfmamj. it's an amazing word
i must see shawn befor ei accept shawn :S
relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZ0n2jpPJw
00,03Game over people, game over.
You'll start thinking about it. One day you'll take it out of the packaging and just look at it, then put it back and go back to what you where doing. Then a few weeks later you'll take it out again, and decide to hang it up.

My jimmies remain unrustled.
Oh dear
Then finally, after seeing it day after day, hanging there when you get dressed, you'll slip it on. You'll look at yourself in the mirror, maybe even sit around the house in it before you take it off and hang it back on.
Anypony wants to see silent hill relevation? :$
the movie?
No thanks, princess. :)
11,01Scoot-Scootaloo: I think there are more than one projects.
Then finally, after you've had it for months, you'll put it on, and you'll step out the door in 4 inch stilleto heels, and walk down the road, never looking back.
Scoot-Scootaloo: and i thought you were serious
yea i saw some more trailers :D
*The End*
11,01RAWRity: Question is, who's going to get my address and send me a maid outfit?
Nittany_Discord: We have our ways.
11,01And will they know my size?
Scoot-Scootaloo, you and I have a mission....to find who did this and have a nice friendly talk with them
00,03Damn right son...
00,03damn right.
I'm completely unfazed by this. :D
11,01Because your story will fail if I put on the outfit and it doesn't fit.
00,03I might as well tell Jenomoprh to stop his movie production ;_;
Nittany_Discord: like I said. We have our ways.
But if you have a girlfriend... :3
Well, just a thought :P
how about paranormal activity AJIsAwesome
Nope.
11,01Well, I would not recommend sending it now because I live with someone that wouldn't understand me in a maid outfit without booting me out of the house.
11,01But if your story comes true, I'll show up at your door in the dress and offer to clean your house.

ima go send emails to roblox :T n force them to unban me
Polydunami I am not kidding you, but the crime only is a problem if you're downtown, but roads and air quality is everywhere. Part of the reason I'm up here is because my mom went to UNBC.
Oh dear
yeah
at least the cars move in rush hour up here
I live in in North Carolina. We rarely have traffic more crowded than a fast-food drivethrue
You mean than AT a fastfood drivethru?
no
picture drive-thrus
0,14ded?
now you have the streets of greensboro and kernersville
RAWRity that's because your drive-thru is the equivalent of Vancouver's rush hour
princess: i really tried to laugh about it... i really did. how old are you again?
Roblox accused me as a hacker >:O
I'm trying to think of something clever to help that sink in.
Yeah, I don't even think even HALF of our roads are paved.
In Canada, that is
at least we have roads
Polydunami: what are unpaved roads? have never seen such thing
It's very crazy when you think about it, Eli. We have roads that are just plain rocks.
My parents went to LA early in the summer, and on the way back, my dad talked to a lady who has never been to Canada. She asked him if we had roads. He said yes. But then she said "No, I mean, like, paved roads."
two guys behind him burst into laughter
Did they talk about igloos as well? :D
no
Canadian_Brony: here it's simple: the road is unpaved, you're in a forest. sometimes not even then.
Canadian_Brony: and if a road has holes, give it half a year and you have a complete new road in place
i lagued
laughed

Hey guys
Lyra`, dat video
I got another one. Some of my dad's friends drove down to the states, and they're from BC (British Columbia). They pulled into a gas station and the guy who was filling up their car looked a bit confused and asked "How did you get here?" They replied "We drove." And the he said this

"Across the ocean?"

0,14some of the people who are working on this game are pro fighting game players
oh shit, I'm not AFK
[18:55:49] You were kicked by SaxyPretender from #bronystate (BUSTAH WOLF). Dat kick
Who/what is BustahWolf?
0,14Seth Killian is the PR guy for this game
that's better
Bustah Wolf? :D

SaxyPretender: at least we got Tomba! :D loved that game!
What game is this,and how is he playing a Playstation Game On A CPU?
Nittany_Discord: No wonder it looks so awesome
but its worth a shot :)
0,14I've...uh...never had a Sony system >.>
Brb
Well, if they don't have it I could probably just order it from the website
bk
0,14but if I did, I'd totally play as Raiden
0,14because Raiden is da bess
Unless they're going to charge ridiculous amounts to ship within the US as well...
is Fighting is magic based on this?
13hallo~
NewSuperBronyU, we can be friends again :D
0,14nope, Eli
0,14and oh hai Shizuka
ohai Shizu. :3
Shizuka: was going on?

13still funny that andchat strips colors >>
SaxyPretender: it's just really similar
I can give you my credit card number
I GOTTA BELIEVE!
hi Shizuka :$
wut?
but im not sure if they will accept a usa shipping address when its a canadian card
Are you sure about that?
:D
0,14Fighting is magic is kinda based on Melty Blood, Blazblue and Marvel vs Capcom
why not?
13so what have i missed
and MLP
Hey guise
0,14...unblockable supers?
Nothing much SHizu.
Whoops closed chat
SaxyPretender: i'm happy they don't have that sucky super attacks
Shizuka: well SaxyPretender is pregnant
13again?
Hi, oGriofa. :)
0,14actually, Fighting is magic does have Supers
I dunno, you shouldn't trust just anyone with your credit card number
Shizuka: we have determined that you're Batman, Vivi's Robin, and Saxy is Blue Beetle
hi oGriofa
Shizuka: :D
Shizuka: what can you expect? him sleeping around town like that
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Vocal Music: Just One Mare (Raindrops)
11,01Congratulations Saxy!
Id trust someone ive known for like 8 years.
is fighting is magic done yet
?
Nittany_Discord: hello Aniki <3
I just put chilipowda on my rice.
0,14nope
not yet
13why am i batman
It might not be so good
11,01Hello Bronysith.
No reason. <_<
Shizuka: dunno, they just decided that
0,14Fighting is Magic won't be done for a while, i'd think
Pink3 no clue about the game, but he probably uses a special audio-video converter to turn something such as RCA (yellow white red) into something the computer can take as input, such as USB.
also, hi Shizuka
I thought otakon was the chat bicycle :S
SaxyPretender: march
0,14we're not marching anywhere?
SaxyPretender: i didn't say they don't have supers. just better supers than that embarasing dance thing
SaxyPretender: well, they ahd it working enough for the tournament at that con, so I would imagine it's sometime in the coming months.
SaxyPretender We're marching to the store to get Halo 4 and AC3 :P
0,14^
wow you two have known eachother for that long?
0,14also, no Parappa dance super is best super
For some reason I've noticed mods like to troll kick me now. Who I'm I otakon now? :P
Alright, email the info to me then and we'll do it that way :)
probably.
Could be worse.
I need to check though because they might just lock my card
0,14also also, it's only 5/6 characters and not all of them are complete
Could be troll bans :P
Spectrum_Rush: Chat bicycle/ :D
if its a usa shipping address and canadian card
Oh, is this the Brawl clone?
DashWithRainbows: True true
0,14also also also, I'm not marching, my copy of halo comes to me
I saw something about a Time Bomb in that EULA
0,14Pick Parappa
So, guess what I just ordered?
the fat one
duh. Kratos
SaxyPretender: fighting is magic comes out in march...

Parappa
so HAlo 4 has feet now?
kratos
0,14Bronysith, show me proff
0,14*proof

0,14because they haven't said anything about that
She said "Me, you, and cake."
Me, You, And Cake!
What game is this,and how is he playing a Playstation Game On A CPU?
...was that Tara as the fat princess?
And I'm pretty sure that requires an adult
Only female character in the game. And she's morbidly obese.
CriticKitten: i am an adult
JESmith71: That's what I was thinking too. :D
JESmith71: i think so :D
you.... don't have a mic plugged in?
0,14also, this is more combo-based than Smash
Kandarihu as it should be
She looks like a human Miss Piggy
any chance on any of us from chat joining ya NewSuperBronyU ? *squee*
alexxm, I respectfully disagree.
SaxyPretender: which do you prefer as a title? fighting game guru...or sensei?
fat princess vs fatprincess? :O
Sure
ok Kandarihu i was just joking anyway
0,14I prefer Ardent Fighting Enthusiast
Bronysith: I prefer the title Lord of Tekken
0,14...because that's my title on P4A
RAWRity: May have to fight Spoony for that one
0,14it doesn't SB
Indeed. Just an AP Bar
CriticKitten: fair enough, I hear he sucks at blocks in the new game.

I wonder if Fat Princess has a butt slam like Peach, it would hit harder
wau tis be a NewSuperBronyU?
0,14and you can fall off the map, but it just leaves you paralyzed when you respawn
It really looks like they tried to copy Brawl but forgot to, ya know, make it fun. O.o
those printers are the worst by the way, I have to unjam them constantly
No ceilings here.
lol yeah
0,14you got it
printers are the same as they have been since 1993.

0,14I don't have UMvC3
this game is pure evil
Quark :3
yeah r&c had an amazing soundtrack
What's funny is that this game aimed to copy Brawl, but....basically botched the whole thing by making killing much harder and fighting somewhat lifeless. O.o YOU HAD ONE JOB.
0,14and I haven't played my MvC3 in a looong time
and i thooght quark was gonna do something :)
no not quark
a wils garados? :S
It does look pretty.

Sowwy....I didn't get to go on the itnerwebz yesterday since practice ended at like 7:30.
parapa
Saxy: >implying that the super move we just witnessed isn'
*isn't a carbon copy of Snake's
SaxyPretender: what kind of fighter is P4A? 2d or 3d like tekken?
this game seems copied, but god that music
I don't exactly have the money to buy ponies now though :P
metropolis... R&C... childhood
although I do have a decent collection
Overall, I think it's an improved game over B/W. The re-imagined gyms and setting were fun, the gameplay was smoother and better balanced, and there were more varied battles, helped by the expanded Regional Dex. However, the plot ultimately wasn't as well executed as B/W, with an ending that's satisfying, but not very enticing.
lol dat echo :D
I think I have a competition that weekend....I have to watch in on the DVR by myslef...:'(
when they get more in stock ill get you one as a thank you for reshipping
and ill pay for shipping.
back
Other games have super moves, but they try to be unique. That was....unabashedly Snake's Final Smash, copy/pasted. :P
WB Ponies47
i have a vita

0,14well, old Dante was Stylish
Bronysith: I enjoy the pokemon designs a lot, and the Battle Frontier was great. My only major issues with G3 were the rather meh plot and the last 1/4 of the game being nothing but surfing
0,14new Dante is laaaaaaaaaaaame
Bronysith: Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, though G3 also covers Firered and Leafgreen
SaxyPretender: idk i like new Dante,the gameplay looks good and the look is growing on me :)

Hiya Silver_Soother. Apparently the chat has robots.
And Tom is now sentient.
Tom has always been sentient.
DashWithRainbows, I blme sxycmptr
He's friggin' Tom.
ASoftFluffyThing: Tell me more about this robot problem.
Biggest diamond you'll ever see.
AJIsAwesome: i get it, toms a rock so he cant speak. *plays drums
superretroworld: :3
That's offensive.
He's a diamond.
>:l
:3
hahaha
I hate that you robots don't realize he is a diamond.
Silver_Soother, everyone's a robot according to DWR and Saxy beep-booped
But he's a shiny grey diamond
Nope, everybot is a robot to me.
Except myself and a few others.
I am not a robot, beep boop.
/me proves that she isn't a robot by stepping in water.
See? Nothing. Except a wet coat which is hell to dry.
DashWithRainbows: not by the ponies perspective
Also Laurayne, this chat has an abundance of cute because ponies

RAWRity and pray dual chop wont miss
Kingdom Hearts is one of those lines of games that I always wanted to play, but my Nintendo fanboyism prevented me from.
Sora vs Twilight Sparkle.
You Eat This And you Wont Know Where You Are For A Week =w=
.... um pass. my stomach called and it said Gone fishin'
/me is the only on who knows of twisted metal :(
Well, my fanboyism of the time.
Hamsters might be cute, but damn they be stupids
okay :3
Kandarihu: but its on DS
Fluttershyfan158: Vampires? Sora. The pony? Twilight
Kandarihu: Same here.
11,01I know of Twisted Metal.
Except that I didn't have a PS2.

My very first memory in life is me and my brother playing a twisted metal game on the ps1 BroPony|MEDIC
No.. KH Sora, Vs Twilight the pony
/me hugs Nittany_Discord
I VOTE TO HAVE A MLP FiM WORLD IN NEXT KH!! :D
twisted metal <3
Nittany_Discord: Twister Metal; that was a game I could play over and over again.
Twisted*

/me 11,01hugs BroPony|MEDIC
Laurayne: Make that happen. :D
^:D
Sora getting into a fight with Discord..Priceless!
11,01Yeah. I enjoyed TM2 through to Black.
:D
/me hugs Silver_Soother
3 and 4 didnt exist
superretroworld, I'm also a stickler for continuity. And I don't think I'd feel right getting into the Kingdom Hearts series without starting with the first two games. I'm not so opposed to the PS2 as I used to be, though.
11,01I never picked up the latest game. Maybe later.
His Cutie Mark Would Be A Key Hole xD
Discord would turn the keyblade into a cheese wedge
I think Disney needs to buy hasbro first
Or a keyblade
...
Nittany_Discord: Its not that bad, but it needs alot of improvment
OH MY GOD
Nittany_Discord: I'd say rent the newest one. For me, it didn't have the charm of the original. It's dark like Black, but without all the endings.
Laurayne, FiM isn't Disney enough
What about Riku?
what would his mark be?
Hrm.
or Kiari?
Fluttershyfan158: a heartless egnima?
So guys, apparently during filming of "The Hobbit" films, Stephen Colbert visited the set, and in an interview he hinted he might have a cameo in one of the films!
0,14wow
but that does mean SQUIRRELGIRL KEYBLADE!
FiM is not Disney, but like all animation, it kind of lives in Disney's shadow.
..Maybe
BroPony|MEDIC But i was just a tiny pony at the time and thats really all i know about TM
0,14that'd be neat, he /is/ a bit LOTR fan
RAWRity: wah
RAWRity: Is... is that good?
HoodyNinja: yes
and/or incredible hulk teaming up with Goofy
Arcane: I know EVERYTHING there is to know about twisted metal
inb4 Smaug is voiced by stephen colbert
My god Breaking Bad
I think it'd be awesome to have Discord fight Sora..THINK OF THE POSSIBILITES!
Well, if a new Kingdom Hearts game leverages Disney's ownership of Marvel, it might be possible to include something based on G1, provided it's stripped of everything that Hasbro still owns: Spike, Applejack, and the name My Little Pony.
HoodyNinja: nah, Smaug's being voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch
HoodyNinja: who is also playing Sauron/The Necromancer
But... the necromancer was only mentioned in the hobbit...
HoodyNinja: so basically Benedict Cumberbatch is all the villains in The Hobbit films.
roosterteeth is the best http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCTdCnC6j7w&feature=g-u-u
he never appeared...
Kandarihu: well just give it a try
But you should expect to see X-Men in the same game.
NewSuperBronyU: hia
Damnit
HoodyNinja: yeah, but since they ended up expanding it to 3 films, they're going to show The Necromancer and all the stuff with him
Like i said incredible hulk teaming up with Goofy
If we end up in Equestria in KH3, I'll sh#@ bricks
Is there a stream atm?
not at,
atm*
I can't wait for PS all-stars ;~;
The MLP World In KH Should Just Have Sora Helping The Mane 6 Fight Discord And Them Useing The EoH To Vanquish Him :3
thelonepony Kay i just wanted to make sure i wasnt bugged
Hi~
np :)
If the Disney side is going to incorporate their Marvel properties, then the Square Enix side might as well include the stuff they own. How about Deus Ex Human Revolution?
Oh hai
Hi StinkomanFan :)
Or make Discord an Orginization 13 member..That'd be a twist.

According to TF2 Dues Ex is in t6he same Canon as it.
Sooo.....
Yeah
Guys! No G4 in Kingdom Hearts! The only way it would work is if it's G1. So it would be Tirac or the Smooze instead.

night BroPony|MEDIC :)
I wanna have Twilight in my party fighting Discord..
Guys, Kandarihu is right about this, I mean, the humans enter the pony world via a well.
And if it comes down to auxillary properties, there should be an interesting X-Men/Deus Ex crossover that deals with naturals who are bigoted against mutants AND augs!
Hell I even have a fanfic planned..It's not a ponyfication..It's a crossover...
that sounded way different in my head.
RDash5000: ._.
Should I give a small rodent candy?
no.
It

HoodyNinja: it so simple, and so popular, that it once again demonstrated why pop wont just die already, and by becoming so popular itll just promote more of the same cheap catchy pop
it's not teribly hard to get the base parts. it's like a kroean verison of solja boy
two new songs i made popped up in my mind :O back to agrueing with roblox..
Meow.
taoumi: except gangnam style is actually good
taoumi: and souja boy is fucking shit
princess: Aurguing with roblox?
twilight_sprinkle: Well, alot of people like it, and just because you don't doesn't mean you have to constantly tell people on the internet they are wrong
yea they banned me
Im done with this conversation
i'm talking about the dance Bronysith and i nterms of a dance solja boy is more interesting for it's base parts
HoodyNinja: i actually never said "you are wrong"
and its WAY past my due time
princess: what for?
princess ah yes, those were they days. Back when I was 11 and Minecraft didn't exist.

twilight_sprinkle: Not on purpose. I mean, its just it looks like it; thats why your getting attacked. That and the part of your argument that i saw was the bare simple basis of stating that pop should die. I agree with you, but people are still feeling alot of stuff they dont like being implied

Hi everypony!
thelonepony, Im good thanks :) hey Kinixys
Kinixys: Oh hai~
so uhhh... for this thing http://www.indiegogo.com/brony have they released the actual ad that will be played?
Hi Kinixys :)
Hey Kinixys
I cant seem to find it anywhere if they have
oh god, the thank you ad
Hi, Kinixys. :)
inb4 people flip out about the ad
that'll be a gem
Inb4 smart people rage
I just wanted to see what it really contained... or if its friggen weird.
Thank you for the warm welcome.
Kinixys: Sarcastic or serious?
Serious
Oh. :D
i've heard tell it's pretty embrassing
Sorry.
inb4 it no big deal ¬_¬
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jb5onftuiw&feature=autoplay&list=PLE8C4D4F2A84C3843&playnext=4&shuffle=67140
then again, it's hearsay
They should have just bought the adspace to play ponies gangnam style.
^
Damn it sprinkle isn't here
I didnt know adspace was that inexpensive... I thought it would have cost more than $12k for 10 30-second slots.
they should've used the money to go to a charity or something rather than use it to plaster their faces onto the boob tube
Did I read Boobtube? Where you must tell me!
could have used that ad space to sell sugar snacks to kids.
Could have used that ad space for bears who can't wipe their asses
HoodyNinja: Those poor bears :(
Then again, it's their money and they can decide what to do with it. I'm not complaining about it.
DoublePint: DAMN YOU CHARMIN! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
so Buytoast the ad isn't actually public yet as far as you know?
Could have used that adspace to give thanks to lord smooze...

Who do you like more: S1 Luna or S2 Luna?
DAMN YOU KINIXYS!
DerpyMuffins: Both.
S2
OFCOURSE
Both :3
_/)___(\
I want to see another luna episode.
S1 Luna didn't exist
Its all a myth
S1 luna existed in the second episode
^
for about 10 seconds
brb have to pee
More than that. :S
It seems Luna is just as popular as Derpy is
and chrysalis had 2 minutes of screen time
but no one cares
also did anyone else notice NMM in the glass thing at the very beginning of S1E1?
DerpyMuffins: damn right
Brad: The first time I watched I didn't.
Last song I listened to was Nightmare Night.
Bronysith: and 12000000000000 pieces of fan content
Why dont they show more Luna anyway?
AJIsAwesome, I wanted it for the second time last night and caught it
08,01chrysalis is best alicorn
DerpyMuffins: Why don't they show more Celestia?
^
Panda|LOL: ;3
*:3
MOAR LUNA!
AJIsAwesome: because she has better things to do than screen time
08,01Winona is best princess
^
^^
They don't show Celestia because she's always behind the camerapony.
I would still like to see more Celestia.
Gamers Luna is best Princess ^_^
*Gamer
^
I liked to know how Celestia got into power
also good evening everypony :)
MLP: Diarchy is Fascinating would selas well to the target market
Hi NoctunalBlade.
Hi NoctunalBlade :)
I'd like to see Celestia have some character development.
Hi, NoctunalBlade. :)
why is their no queen for the ponies
hi NoctunalBlade
*wouldn't
Did they elect her or did she just put a crown on her head and declared herself Princess
AJIsAwesome, I think the more they develop her the less "powerful" she seems.
LunasGuard: You do know what Lauren said about the queen title, right?
Well... there is that sun thing...
Brad: She can still be developed AND powerful.
Disney made "Queens" evil
Just look at Shinji in the reborth movies.
AJIsAwesome i do. Disney Queens are always evil
Or Simon in Gurren Lagann.
AJIsAwesome, I have no idea what that is
Back what I miss
Queen Chrysalis ^_^
AJIsAwesome: I miss it
*rebirth
I kinda want to see some more Nightmare
LunasGuard: Miss what?
NoctunalBlade: Glad I missed it
Brad: Have no idea what what is?
I wonder if they will do more winter episodes.
Alright Ima be afk, ping me if there is stream
AJIsAwesome, shinji
I want to see Celestia write a letter to Twilight.
HoodyNinja: o lol that feel into place pretty well :D
Dont tab fail either
Kinixys: She did in the Gilda episode, but only for a couple of seconds.
AJIsAwesome: wat did she say about queen titles?
LunasGuard: Disney made Queens evil
I had the weirdest thought the other day
anime I assume?
DerpyMuffins: we probably will lol
LunasGuard: She said that the title of "queen' would sound cold for Celetia, so she changed it to Princess instead.
I imagined bronystate as a room, and everybody got a fold-up chair and sat and talked
AJIsAwesome: But not an "I learned something about friendship, too!" letter.
oh awesome
HoodyNinja: I imagine it as a giant theatre where people come and go. :D
"princess celestia" flows better.
Anyone want to see Luna take a personal protege?
AJIsAwesome: There's a projector in the corner
It'd be intresting
Yes, but who?
Trixie
I love it how mlp mixes modern tech with old stuff as well.
AJIsAwesome: Oh, that makes sense
I have had this idea before
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Wishing Well of HORROR! / Little Library of HORROR!
its quite funny.
How many filly unicorns are on the show?
*shrugs*
I imagine Bronystate as this ride you get on that takes you through some animated enviroments as songs playin the background.
Too much to count?
im with HoodyNinja lol
Only one really comes to mind for Luna's protege
Dinky anyone?
well that could work
Um... NO
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTk6eY9EY5g&feature=BFa&list=FLQtFbXHXXgEowjYbd3_9Y8w Have you ever heard RD sing?
It could, but I'd prefer someone more well known in the show.
Dinky would need backstory
She would need to be a CHARACTER first
implying any of the characters have a proper backstory
and that would be pretty hard to pull off
08,01dinky is celestia's daughter.

Shizuka hmm, never really made cheese before.
13from cows?
08,01NewSuperBronyU: and apples
You get milk from breasts

None of that artificial stuff.
08,01mostly apples.
11,02O.O Moo
You leave milk in a cup for 6 months
I did it once

Tasted ok
Dankier caves are best to grow mold.
I had to get my stomach pumped tho
I found mold in my shoes once...
Mold?
DerpyMuffins: Yesh

Never looked at cheese the smae way again

So you know that question I asked earlier... I'd like to re-phrase: Is anyone from around MN?
I have yet to meet a brony IRL...
Big_Macintosh_1992: Check if there's a Meetup Group for your area?
There might be one in the Twin Cities.
I have yet to see Hasbro sell plushies
They have.
They would make billions
But they're the cheap kind.
Hasbro makes cheap plushies, but I've never seen a Hasbro pony plush
http://www.hasbro.com/common/productimages/en_US/4408b8555056900b10aa2999ee978fe3/441229855056900B101223CEB1A22F3F.jpg
until today
Eh
Not that great
I seen better
If you're talking about high quality plushes, then I would love that.
and HOLY MOTHER CELESTIA WTF IS THAT THING!?!?!?
I know people took pictures of me... but well, it's a common thing.
It looks G3!
^
-People thought I was Darkman.
Good plushes are in the hundreds.
But not the thousands
Canadian_Brony, that is a pony plushie by Hasbro.
AJIsAwesome: i saw that in Toys R Us today lol
That way they would make so much more money
*.
AJIsAwesome, exactly. And they know there's people who make some damn good ones too.
/me is forever alone
A good plushie will cost ya about 50-200 US dollars
/me hugs Big_Macintosh_1992 "no you're not" :)
Aren't there some that go larger than that?
Oh. Ththat image that AJIsAwesome is the talking Pinkie Pie doll. We saw a video the other day of one running low on battery power. Remember?
mass produced plushies wont look the same
d'awww thanks NoctunalBlade
Like $500?
DerpyMuffins: the one i saw was about 25 i think
they want to keep costs down obviously so people can afford to buy them.
Big_Macintosh_1992: any time :)
Kandarihu: Oh yeah, that. :D
NoctunalBlade: , Big_Macintosh_1992 , as Mr. Rogers put it "We're electronic neighbors."

Randomnerd: searching for meetup groups... all too far away...
Big_Macintosh_1992: Understandable... I have it easy, I live in the NY metropolitan area.
Big_Macintosh_1992: Same here.
ah... lotsa people
I found some meetup places, but they're either too far away or i have stuff to do that gets in the way of going to one.
I live in small town central MN, have no car of my own, and am living at home because I can't afford anything else
i still wish to meet a irl brony before i die
Big_Macintosh_1992: The Anime Convention might yield Bronies. They go to every con.
superretroworld: right?
superretroworld: Don't we all?
Even Chiller -a NJ Horror Convention.

I have.
Randomnerd: i was borderline brony last year and chickened out of the brony-going. Gonna give it a shot this year
Good, life's too short to be ashamed of little ponies on your desk.

(I got a little bit of heckling from my brother when he saw Fluttershy)
/me is also hiding secrets
Randomnerd: what's heckling?

LadyCanary: :O
metaknight fitw
/me eats theloneponys brain
Wait, you cosplay, LadyCanary? (Im slow sorry)

/me puts shells into mossberg I'm sorry thelonepony it has to be done
How big is Olimar?

WITH ANYONE WITH ANYONE!
DoublePint: do it man ;~;
O.o
i cant become a walker ;~;
SpadeMagnes[R]: Less than a foot, I think.
Tabuu kind of comes out of nowhere personally
At least in his games.
I think he's at big as a quarter or something
DerpyMuffins: And Shizu x Canary x Woona x Rain
/me aims at the lonely pony... hands you the shotgun, go out with honour my friend
DerpyMuffins: What about Meanwhile X Trixie?
Has Tabuu ever been mentioned before this game?
LadyCanary: I cosplayed one day as the Invisible Man -not joking, I was covered in Gauze.
DerpyMuffins: Nope.
oh oh, NewSuperBronyU can i join? pweeeease?
Not really, he just comes out of nowhere
I AM ZIIIM!

Preach it, Canadian_Brony
NewSuperBronyU: ok, give me a bit and i'll get me friend code and such lol

Take Meanwhile X Trixie for example.
sonicandmario85 X Gundam 00
Landmaster!
I shipped with my wife :S
NO OTAKON
:3
otakon x everything
I LIEK HIM....
Meanwhile hates Trixie, and because of that people shipped him with her. :D
why are we talking about ships :3
thelonepony: *shrugs*
OTAKON X SONICANDMARIO85
Trixie is best pony
thelonepony because I mentioned best ship
Because r34
Did they ever explain why they gave Wolf,Fox, and falco the same fucking final smash?
O_o
SpadeMagnes[R]: Nope.
I don't really want to be shipped.
It screams lazy to me
Randomnerd: Same here.
Randomnerd x sonicandmario85
It cant be that fucking hard to make a different smash for the other two

Augh... and I need to get some manic panic in pink.
Buytoast: You can't? Whats wrong with me?
Wait, are we applying logic to videogames again?
Well what about the asshole tanooki in the town?!
He has at least 10 shines!
only where it benefits my argument
What's a shine?
Shine Sprite.
it's a star
he has short term memory loss and is a kleptomaniac
11,02gg :)

Seriously the people of Isle Delfino are douchebags and they deserve to die in a fire
taoumi: that's no star~ oh wait nvm.....
La la la~
esentialy it's the same as a star was in SM 64
Ok *looks suspiciously at you guys*
Shadow mario doesnt even look like mario fully and Mario just fucking arived to the island so how could he have done said crimes
11,02LadyCanary: La :3
And he doesnt even get a fair trial
NewSuperBronyU always likes to pick the troll levels

Derpy_Hooves:PICK SONIC WHEN YOU DO IT AGAIN PLEASE HAVE MERCY FOR SONIC

sonic :3
SpadeMagnes[R]: Same here.
wat
Just wish he had more power in his moves.
I just love how sonic with the bunny ears can out run the cars in Big blue
Its hilarious
oh ,new pork city
SpadeMagnes[R]: Me too. :D
Sonic is great for racking Damage, but lacks any killer moves.
^
He seems to be a hit and run kind of character
^
in other words, he's the lighning bruiser
He can be good for team battles, but alone he's pretty bad.
Isnt this banned in tournaments due to size?
*shrugs*
mmhmm
I haven't been to any Brawl tournaments.
But this stage I HATE.
I know for a fact Great Temple is banned
With a fiery passion.
SpadeMagnes[R]: It is? How?
The massive size and the stallign tactics people can abuse
SpadeMagnes[R]: What about New Pork City?
one I've been to only allowed final destination to be played, and they only had one song played -_-;
Dken2021: That sucks.
Got to go everyone...to sleep.

AJIsAwesome: Interestig since some of it would be no dialouge, just use the pets' gestures and actions to tell the story
THAT was DerpyHooves?
Canadian_Brony: different user
0,14the guy who kept dropping smiley bombs
same user, different nick; or different users altogether

good morning btw
gentlemen-geeky: im ok, hows about u?
DaringDerpy: hell you sir
This isn't really embarassing to me, but this is not the best way to represent the fandom.

twilight_sprinkle: im and fine old boy
gentlemen-geeky: good :)
twilight_sprinkle: yes
dabi would love this

No one can understand
Still not embarrasing. I'm pretty sure I've seen worse.

theres always worse
11,02So...this is what a brony is...

twilight_sprinkle: i did that once
gentlemen-geeky: did you beat him up and drink beer afterwards like a true man?
damn, they're more obnoxious than a 1st grade recess
i wanna be a part of this :D
twilight_sprinkle: yes for he has insolted my honor
gentlemen-geeky: good, yay for manliness. as my old P.E. teacher used to say, man is derived from the word manliness!
then again, at least they aren't those people that were ruining people's club photos by forcing horses into the background
now those guys were dicks
Unless this guy owns that unicycle, I can only see pain and suffering in someones future...
twilight_sprinkle: yes on the feild of manly combat

Sumica: hello good sir
One more reason not to go to meetups
ohai Sumi
NewSuperBronyU: How long is this video?
11,028 minutes 25 seconds :)
11,02You survived O-O
cant imagine most meetups consisting of unicylce riding in the winter though
DaringDerpy: Meh. I'd go to meetups, but not like these.
i died a long time ago
again!
2/10, would not eat.
tbh id be fun going to a meetup like this too,even if it would get a little awkward
AJIsAwesome: there are others?
if you're going to act like that, at least do it in someone's house or something
NewSuperBronyU: cold you show two men fighting manly combat on a field of honor
Plus, I'm PRETTY sure all meetups aren't like this. :S
don't disturb people trying to eat a big mac
here on bronystate, they show only the awkward ones
goddamn
big macs r srs bsns
http://rustledmyjimmies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MY-JIMMIES-REMAIN-UNRUSTLED.jpg
i wonder how annoyed the other people in the bowling lanes were
AJIsAwesome: lol thats new
twilight_sprinkle: :P
meetups are always loud though
can you imagine bringing your small child out for a round of family bowling, only to have to be next to a group of 16-30 year old men with neckbeards and gangly arms hugging and jumping around about horses on a screen?
twilight_sprinkle: "At the convention!"
Vordox: the convention at least confined the bronies to a place :P
twilight_sprinkle: What's wrong with expanding on being childly? :P
11,02gentlemen-geeky: O-o
Vordox: eh nothing, as long as its civil
its still better than getting hammered
NewSuperBronyU: yes good sir
:3
Meh, I still wouldn't be shocked. People are weird like that.
no one really needs to know that I'm a brony. I don't even like the label. some people know that I watch ponies, but I would never sing this loud on the street or something like that
NewSuperBronyU: "One, two three four..."
daaaaaaw, its too adorable
In fact, everyone's weird.
NewSuperBronyU: have you seen seal 3?
inb4 :3
at least they arent drunk, when a meetup gets drunk, thats when things go to hell
NewSuperBronyU: "Compaaanyyyy!"
twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, THAT's when things can get very hectic.
twilight_sprinkle: If people are drunk at convention here, they'll be tossed out faster then they even notice.
"I don't know these people!"
AJIsAwesome: yeah and i dont drink, which is why i dont want to end up in a drunk company
NewSuperBronyU, you have some weird fetishes o.O
twilight_sprinkle: Same here.
11,02o////o
Vordox: here where, in england?
:3
twilight_sprinkle: Sweden
good rule, Vordox
Strict no drinking Policy
Vordox: ah. well i actually heard that most conventions do allow drinking, good to know not all are
we require more seals

11,02I did dis game and won an iPod Shuffle about a week ago :3
:)
wow
one in a million
thats gambling for you
00,10and then it dont drop the prize
yeha, but that thing is rigged so badly
why couldnt my local stacker have good prizes when i one :<
lol
it's actually impressive
if i got me a wii, first game i'd buy is metroid prime trilogy. ^_^
:)
stacker...
the game that moves your stack over to the side
00,10the real question is how much cash did they put in to that already?
11,02$1.00
too much
00,10yeah you are full of it if you belive that they got it on the first go super
coin pusher.... if only those damn machines didnt have alarms when i shake them
DeathStar: are you thear madum
gentlemen-geeky: indeed I am good sir
i swear man, if they dont start work on the next f-zero game for the wii, i'm gonna be pissed >.<
DeathStar: umm yes

Who uses ipods? 6_9

11,02thisguy: Yup
im confused
theres already a ninja gaiden 3
00,10wiiU it launches with many titles you have played already

gtg. have a nice day :)
00,10wait no, that's nintendo in a nutshell
11,02;~;
bai DaringDerpy
bye DaringDerpy :)
good by DaringDerpy
11,02But...I never played Mass Effect 3 though :<
me neither, only the demo though
seemed promising, then i stopped thinking about it when i played minecraft for the 360
11,02But I don't wanna pay $60 for a $20 game on other consoles though .-.
NewSuperBronyU: oh yea that :D
NewSuperBronyU: THEY CANT CALL THAT GAME Ninja gaiden 3 BECAUSE there is already a ninja gaiden 3
I don't want to play $60 for a game. Period.
me niether
15 dollars is pleanty when you sellign a bajillion copies
00,10SO near as i can tell by the wiiU
00,10all asians have 3 arms
DuskStarshimmer: thats why i always wait for the next month where its about £20
correction pay for $60 and the DLC with it

NewSuperBronyU: what non-nintendo game are you most excited for the WiiU?
11,02Call of Duty Black Ops II :3
i guess, sure
i'm more interested in campaign and zombies, not much else :\
NewSuperBronyU: call of duty insults my honor
11,02:<
inb4 battlefield on WiiU
i'd say i'll look forward to it compared to MW3
or MW4 if activision gets any ideas
MW4? dont give them any ideas now
thisguy: you insult my honor
they might already have it
inb4 MW6
i man, i'm not kidding, out of the 3 in the series, MW1 was the one taht i really got excited about
inb4 MW6 DLC pack#1
even bought the special edition with "variety" map pack, that's how awesome it was to me
all the call of dutys are the same cut and pase game
lol
With new trees! and new brown people to shoot!
look a liitle power suit
Is it just me, or does the Wii U seem like an oversized handheld connected to a console at base?
JRP: how are you sir
finr
i dont think the wii U is meant to be portable
fine*
11,02I hope future Metroid games look like Metroid Blast
JRP: thats good
6_9
metroid blast?
i hope they hurry up and make SSBB 2
:(
oh
the one with dwarves
derp
thisguy: That's what I mean. It's like a handheld you can't take anywhere.
in space suits
11,02I only kid ofc, I hope for more of Metroid: Other M but with better graphics :D
is....is that a stylus?
11,02Kencolt: That's also a home console.
w-w-why?
11,02Because it's a touch screen...
well i guess you could draw...
pffft... mario games were tougher back then
lol true

hi
Vivix: you insult my honor
Not on purpose!
The 3DS XL pisses me off, you make the entire thing bigger and you still don't put on a second stick in that huge empty area in the lower right hand corner.
Vivix: a dule
i'm bored
I don't like dueling ;__; Forgive me
Vivix: to the field of manly combat
I'm noot maanly
NewSuperBronyU is going to buy all the accessories for his Wii U~

killer instinct was so damn awesome
Vivix: you have no honor and you are not a gentelmen

i want to see nitdeo reles a zelda game on a difrent consle

bai thisguy
Meh... the only thing I play nowadays is WoW. Do not have the twitch reflexes for any of the console games exept a FF title-- and the recent FF titles stink. Hasn't been a good one since FFXI online. (FFXII wasn't so good, except for Fran, and FFXIII was nailoed to rails.)
NINTENDO GIVE RETRO STUDIOS THE METROID LICENCING AND BUILD OFF THE SAME GAME ENGINE OR RECIVE REALLY ANGRY LETTERS
huf
Doesn't have cable, but is online... OK.
im only getting wii u for metroid prime
Nintendo games on other consoles? Who do you think Nintendo is, Sega?

11,02Np, later NoctunalBlade :)
Bye NoctunalBlade
Hello NinjazzMobile :3
Hey hey hey.
JRP: classes sprort
Well I say I ahve never met a brony so rude in my life.
Ah superbrony.
TheRainbowDawn: you have no honor
NinjazzMobile: can you click chat linksfrom your mobile?
I think so... BUT id like to save the images onto my laptop.
/me sips tea
ell quiet chat...
gentlemen-geeky: I am forced to wonder... You constant harping on honor. It seems your honor is a small, insecure thing, taking offense at any percieved slight, and assuming that all senses of honor must match yours. It brings into question the nature of this honor.
*well
NinjazzMobile: k then, I'll wait for you to be on your laptop :)
NinjazzMobile: have you been busy lately?
Ty Surge.
Oh so very.
11,02I'm a rude brony? :<
And between me3 mp and other things, its hard finding time to come online.
Kencolt You may have a view of honour but that doesn't ean everyone will see eye to eye to you. ALthough saying this I cannot call someones view of honour incorrect without being a hypocrite.
NewSuperBronyU No not you.
Kencolt: ah finly anuthe gentelmen my honor is not small good sir i have a good seanes of honor and i welll defend it and uthers to the death
Someone on youtube.
SB, you're kidding right? You're far from rude. FAR.
11,02You'd be surprised :(
I really would.
NewSuperBronyU: your are a spiting exsample of gentelmenship
gentlemen-geeky: One sign of a proper gentleman is not to constantly question other's honor at any provocation. A TRUE gentleman forbids such action, and only the most egregious of offenses would be cause for such a declaration, But, I can forgive this because of relative youth.
11,02i liek gentlemenshipness :3c
Everyone's got a tiny bitch inside them that roots for the rudeness~~
I can be pretty rude too :| but NewSuperBronyU is a nice guy :$
/me yaps quietly
/me hugs MadSurge ;A;
Vivix: yep
And as many here will tell youm,when I speak of youth, I MEAN it. :$
I want to talk to Flyboy.
Aaaaaah grandpaps. Don't feel like that.
Kencolt: aye you are right sir but some times honor can only be defened on up held on the feld of combat
NinjazzMobile: Thing is... I COULD theortically be your grandfather.
Kencolt how old are you?
55 come November.
/me spits out tea
more demos? well it's better then nothing i supose
Well, theoretically yes.
I say you're older than I thought.
Yes. Even we olf guys can be bronies.
But both sides are 60 and above.
Kencolt think about it. Some people your age cannot even turn on a computer.
TheRandomkid321: I know. Mom can, however-- does quite well. SHe likes to keep an eye on everyone's finances.
Lol.
Not /too/ suprised to see an older brony really.
Not common but shows the power of the show.
I'm sorry but I'm just so underwhelmed by the Wii U
considering the age of internet and computers, me neither~ Fun though, tosee it represented
Wii Underwhelm?
But I am something of the black sheep of the family-- theeldest son who, instead of becoming a "normal" member of society is instead, a gamer, anime fan, and brony. (The last of which is the least remarked on, actually)
Call me old but. I won't get the Wii U. The idea of a wireless touchscreen controller scares me..
DAT SWEET FILLY ASS!
Those two lines after eachother
Kencolt: how u come acrost suche a fnadum and show may i ask
If I was in your shoes sire kencolt, wouldn't have it any other way.
gentlemen-geeky: I mefrely heard things, decided to investigate it, and was pleased with what I found.
As for anime, and gaming, well, been at that nearly 30+ years.
carrots ?
Kencolt: ah
I think of normality as popular because of its compatibility socially and in work and education, but if you are unafraid to forgo that ease then there are many more worlds to be a part of
Kencolt: i love Battle of the Planets
Niice
gentlemen-geeky: Once you see the original, you become horrified at what Sandy Frank did. Then again I tend to be horrified at ANYTHING Sandy Frank did.
Kencolt: i might look it up
Holy shit I'm still here.
Hi!
Ohai Canadian_Brony :P
Canadian_Brony: welcome back to life friend
11,02How is quality? o.o

NewSuperBronyU: grate sir
gentlemen-geeky life? Bro, I just finished reading (legit) a good Human-in-Equestria story.
NewSuperBronyU tis pretty good.
Numbers! Those are strictly forbidden in Ponyville... >_>
quality looks good
Canadian_Brony: ah
Oh please, don't remind me about the numbers :S
tis a shame but i have to leve and during a good ep to well im go night all
hey
hey Polydunami

I'm up to the eleventh episode of LOST and it's... a thing.
night all
g'night gentlemen-geeky
Wiggle
Canadian_Brony: night
Who is worse: Trixie or Diamon Tiara?
/me likes both
:O
<.<
I prefer character development, tbh
I wouldn't HANG with Tiara or Spoon, but I like them-
I bet you'd like Sawyer :P
Actually, I didn't-
Well, he was okay- I liked hurley
Actually, I like Hurley. And Sayid
MOAR APPLES!!!
Yeah
/me noms on an apple
Fine Art
berry punch scared
Such a terrible salesmare
they have credit cards?
I'm a metro. I live in Metro Vancouver :3
I also really like Lyra and Bon bon the way they've been shown in the show up til now
Young, femenine, a litttlee bitchy, and--fun
sounds like my sister
And do they have their own personalities apart from ones created by the fans?
Kind of, glimpses. Iron Will episode, eh Fameous fluttershy episode- Wedding episode(Maybe canon for Lyra, not sure)
What a nice plot, Twist.
and just twisting their bg appearances
I remember when Lyra first spoke; the chat exploded
Hehehe
Dat face :'(
I didn't see the chat at the time, but I was like D=!!
but yeah, I like that personality, I like fanon too, but I think the glimpses we saw in the show are a bit more interesting
I have to say, MLP doesn't actually have "character development" so much as already well developed characters that do learn and evolve-- but still stay the same at core. Which I like a lot.
How does a pony learn, let alone master, a martial art?
They have their ways
Sooo, Applebloom sucks at everything?
These are not characters that need to learn a great, life-changing lession-- they are fine as they are. That's kind of the point.
She still gets annoyed, but she reins it in
Kencolt so THAT's why it sounds familiar!
k thx
cupcakes with a Dash of Rainbow
Actually, a Lemon Cupcake would take a bit of sour and some zest.
-__-
Ooooow, damnit Applebloom, my tongue hurts in sympathy now
I burnt my tongue last week.
My food still tastes like rubber.
Aww
I know, it sucks
better than having it frozen to a pole
Hehe, true

We could make a secret society, and the only way others can join is if they were funny hats! *puts on a funny hat and chuckles*
Self-made cutie mark
I mean, the secret society part. I've seen that in a fanfic I've read recently.
Well, more like secret organisation of bureaucracy
Oh?
Um

It was featured on EQD about a week ago
I guess my cutie mark would be a Wacom pad>_>

You don't even know whats rainbow road
Ah too many tabs!
Vivix, correction: not enough.
It's the final track of Mario Kart
never enoguh
I've got three browseres open <,<
FF, Chrome and Opera-
Then why you hate it?
hmmm
You suck at it?
Could be cuz I only played the SNES version, but there's no way to not die on that track.
The_Engineer, rainbow road?
Without coming in last
Phase4: Mario kart. play that game
Gold
don't have it on me
Mario kart DS
Its easier
wow
text shadow
is alarmingly vague
Text shadow?
Oh that looks nice
Haven't played a mario game since Mario64. :P
I'm able to z-index hgroup in jsfiddle-
And Smash Bros doesn't count
I <3 mario 64
Sup everypony
And mario sunshine and mario karts
Vivix, must be flash then
Hello Moopy
it likes to play funny buggers
Any newer Mario games I've played were at other people's houses
Yeah-
hello
I played New Mario Wii once
It was alright
Which game is your favourite
Phase4: >dat timer
Mario 3 on the NES
Not mario related
No contest
Oh
yo phase4 sup dude
wheres my count down
In that case I don't have one. :P

Gold_Demona, Moopy: i is experimenting
ok
Gold_Demona: Super Mario World too :3
MadSurge: Oh yes, Mario World was awesome! It ties with Mario 3
I WANT TO BE THE VERY BEST
LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS
Gold_Demona: only complaint? too easy :D
MadSurge: If you say so. :P
Watcha doin in xp mode
Or wait, Phase4, site-title id refers to the <h1> tag, <hgroup> has no id
o_O
Vivix, wasnt the id on...
Gold_Demona: but then again, I think Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is a balanced game :D
oh wait, yeah
MadSurge: .....SERIOUSLY? o_o
MadSurge: I've never played it, but I know I'd die in the first level easily.
Gold_Demona: Ghosts 'n' Goblins though, that was insane.
MadSurge: Wait... What? Which one's the one with the knight that loses his armor when he gets hit?
Saving pokemon just incase it breaks again
Gold_Demona: Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is the second game of the series
Does anyone know castle crashers?
The_Engineer: I've heard the title before, but I'm not really familiar with the game.
Check out the gameplay :D
i just got the hot topic derpy for $50au + shipping
/me is jealous of Starchaser
lucky sonava
Starchaser: ENVYYYY
I have a twilight pony doll from mc donalds and it kinda looks like berrypunch with twlights hair
heh
I wish I had a derpy
one was 4100
100$
TAKE THAT RATATATA
Gold_Demona: the series is actually Ghosts 'n' Goblins, Ghouls 'n' Ghosts, Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts and Ultimate Ghosts 'n' Goblins :D
Sing my song and become nothing.
MadSurge: I've heard of Ghouls n Ghosts and Super Ghouls n Ghosts. I'm pretty sure those are the ones I'm thinking of that's ridiculously difficult and you only have two hits to live.
wow
Run on sentence of doom. XD
ie 9 screws the page up horribly
Hm-
xD
lolwut :D
no css3 stuff, right?
White girls with asian guys
Oh so THAT'S the Asian Women I've heard mentioned on here. XD
what is the command again
i got the same thing on here to
Gold_Demona: the first three are like that. Only the last game has actual armor hitpoints
For?
MadSurge: I see. You must be some super madskill'd gamer then. :D
what are you trying to do phase4?
Gold_Demona: in the second and last game though you can shoot also above and below you, and the third and last game have a double jump
Moopy, get this vm to talk to the webserver on my laptop
Gee that sucks
ah well
i cantwait for season 3 to start all the chat spam
eeyup
MUD SPORT IS FAILING ON ME
oh thats right
we have cloudflare
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
cant do a live demo for you guys
I never use the sport moves...
I find them pointless
I'm fighting a electric pokemon
i need it
/me had to google Cloudflare
i can't wait untill i get 2 of my games coming out
Gold_Demona: the last game is actually very accessible. You have actual hitpoints, lifes are easy to come across, you restart from where you died, and you have a variety of shields to block enemy projectiles with
ok machined the two halfs of the mane....now i can go to sleep happy
The_Engineer: Don't have a ground type?
I do?
Ground types are immune to electricity
I have a Onix a Pidgey and Chikorita
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/banner3.png
I still need to get ratata
Use the onix on the electric types
Onix laughs at electric moves
I am
But it gets paralyze
Paralyzed*
Gold_Demona: of course, there's also a ton of things that hate you and bottomless pits. Also, the true final boss can be accessed only by collecting hidden golden rings :D
Looks pretty good
Hai everypony
MadSurge: heh, I don't think I'd survive. I'm not nearly the gamer I used to be. :D
hey phase4 with all that stuff your doing it looks like your doing the hacking stuff
XD
The_Engineer: Paralyze heals and berries.
Gold_Demona: my platformer skills are up the task! :D
XD
MadSurge: LOL, obviously. :D

Guys do you think I should let my chikorita evolve or not evolve?
yes
What do you mean by yes?
Let it evolve
Better stats
Screw that I aint letting it evolve
its cute
A'ight
Gold_Demona: Is there any point to not letting mons evolve?
So who is streaming?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcYiFDgRdFk&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&feature=plcp
Phase4
phase4 is
ohai DerpyMuffins
Hello DerpyMuffins
MadSurge: The only benefit to not letting a pok?mon evolve is that they learn their moves faster.
MadSurge: Other than that, no benefit at all.
Gold_Demona: then nope, bigger and stronger.
I'm writing a clip for a short comedy video... I have a slight idea of what I want. It to open on me and a friend playing a game of chess. My friend then movie a peice and saying "check mate" then me looking at him. Then the chess board and flipping the chess boad making the peices fly everywhere... where to go from there... where to go...
this music is beautifull
What?
Grammar pwease
Gold_Demona: unless they learn useful moves for mons evolved with an item, that is
The_Engineer typed in a hurry sorry.
FAFASFSAFSFAFASFASFSA
And there goes onix
11,02I've been with this site for little over a year now o.o
MadSurge: There are only a couple of species that learn something different if they don't involves, but more often than not in those cases, the evolved form learns better moves.
TheRandomkid321, how about "another game?" or something along those lines
Surprising thought, isn't it NewSuperBronyU?
Ugh, typing fail. "If they don't evolve" I mean
11,02Yesh o3o
hase4 I want that to just be the opening not the whole plot.
ah
I know exactly how you feel. I think I've been here for over a year now as well. :P
Hey
I will have soon
Phase4
I've been here for almost a year.
Gold_Demona: yeah, I mean the mons that evolve with stones and that once they evolved they can't learn other moves
6-7 months.
?
How do you keep brony state chat up even though you're playing tf2
Feels like a year.
Ninjazz! :$
MadSurge: Yeah, those I can understand not evolving until later.
Ohai MadSurge.
The_Engineer: Dual screen setup works wonders for me there. :P
/me licks Ninjazz :3
Much much much easier to typing on a keyboard.
The_Engineer, borderless window
MadSurge: There are exceptions to that too. Like Eevee. You want to evolve that critter EARLY
The_Engineer, borderless windowed
its like fullscreen but alt tab works
I mean
o u Adam. Still licking people.
I ant to keep it open
Like
11,02And here I thought, 'Would I really still be with this site this time next year?'
chat still on the side even though i click on tf2
Then try dual screen. :P
11,02The answer was yesh :3
Gold_Demona: so it learns more moves of its evolved type?
Same here NewSuperBronyU. :P
The_Engineer, open TF2 in windowed mode then
/me noms on Lasharus
MadSurge: Yeah
Oy.
I just had this suit cleaned.
I dont want it windowed
I'm not so much on the /site/ but I'm on chat.
The_Engineer, it looks the same as fullscreen
Since I STILL can't watch the damn stream.
Then you're not going to be able to use IRC and TF2 at the same time.
I mean border windowed
not windowed
It's a game of give and take.
POOTIS
And there goes pokemon

red team is nothing but campers
its anoying
I hate turtle engies.
I always went combat engie though.
Ninjazz, the best engi si turtle engi than can work as combat

Cat's don't meow to communicate with cats... they do it to communicate with humans.... woah...
so they communicate with their minds? O_O
Phase4: go sleepies now
Phase4, I have yet to see that work effectively. I've tried. Using that shotgun that uses scrap as ammo, putting down a turret and dispenser down on a choke point but running around patrolling with the team.
Mini sentries, btw.
I am coming now
I was busy
getting food
Ninjazz, you can use the wrench that increases build speed
Phase4, I like having not to focus on the building at all and more so on the combat works best for me. Also, I can't even stay still on one spot easily.
I'd join, but these maps seem like a PITA
that song
what's that song?
solved the spawncamping AND the spawn timer
i solve practial problems
if I'm right this is notacleverpony

Hello
hi
Hello Nick_Scratch|Music
hello every one!
/me licks AdamTheDuck
/me noms RainbowPie "Am I doing it right?"
Ninjazz: Stand still in one spot on CSS and it'll only make my job easier
Onry if I accidently buy an AWP, XAX.
AdamTheDuck, nope :3 theres a special way you have to do it
/me Sing my song and become nothing. Sing my song and become nothing. Sing my song and become nothing.
Ninjazz: as much as an AWP seems like quite a noobish weapon, it takes a bit of aim still. I still miss over half my shots.
if you wanna talk about skill sniping, talk about a game with bullet drop and travel time
Whats with the chorus Phase4?
DerpyMuffins: celestia origins extended battle theme
?
iz musiks
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PLs7QuwzRc&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=8
XAX, I know. As much as an awpfag would like to argue with me that it takes more skill than any other weapon, it actually requires aim. Since I haven't played CSS in like... forever, I'm probably shit with it now. Used to get lucky with it though.
But Scout was always more fun to use.
scouts noscope for days
Yes. Lol.
the noscope spread is rather small even when you're moving
talking about snipin
hey guys
without the dropoff
Hai alexxm
Depends on which game we talkin' 'bout.
Unless you're going to be all high and mighty and bring real sniping in here.
how've you been DerpyMuffins
Alright
hey DerpyMuffins
Hey
what is this stage
Ohai alexxm
How are things?
How the heck are ya alexxm?
test
i'm good AdamTheDuck and Gold_Demona you
Great alexxm, most of the "oh no the exams are near, lets give our students all the assignments so they can't revise" homework is mostly done. :$
Doing good, thanks. I just finished having breakfast. :3
I hate having a job right now
I want to read more of Background Pony D:
;-;
What a nightmare of a fic.
300k words.
/me sets a comfortable chair with a warm fireplace infront for CrimsonPhoenix
And SSAE didn't think he'd be working on it long and people would burn his house down.
Hah.
Ninjazz, it's still So goddamn epic
hey guys ^^
and that lenght is nothing in compare to End of Ponies
Hello JT
but still yeah it's 300k words sure
how are things JT
They are good
but the story is just soooooooo awesome you forget about the lenght
CrimsonPhoenix, don't spoil. I only jumped on when Chapter one came out and couldn't continue because there was other stuff going on. >_>
Crimson ur talking about griffin the griffin?
OH GOD
Just chapter 1?
Mmmmmmhm.
duuuuuude you're missing some epic stuff
Morning~
I do like
Priority has been changed.
1 chapter each day
/me licks Ponies47
Welcome ponies47
Good morning Ponies47 :P
Well Its midday here but still good morning XD
and each chapter becomes more amazing than the previous one
pon
crimson which story are ya talking about?
Hmmm. I'll take your word for it. I was just thinking it was gong to be feelsy moment after feelsy moment.
also what I love about Background Pony is that each chapter feels like its own story
There's quite alot of feelzy I admit but you actually get used to it.....like Lyra
whats background pony about
Still the fact that each chapter is almost 20k each turns me away somewhat. >_<
Phase4: play doom
wut I miss?
20k words*
Ninjazz whats the problem with that? :P
Ninjazz, don't let that get to you, I knpw I felt the same
I've seen worse
JT, no problem. Just I have alot of things to do in a day.
Well, I'll certainly be picking it up again soon then, CrimsonPhoenix.
JRP|laptop, no :<
Phase4: quake, duke nukem 3d, crap?
alexxm, Background Pony is about Lyra being stuck in a curse that would make everyone forget about her after a conversation, she cannot prove in any way that she exist and she cannot go too far from Ponyville without freezing from all over her body.
I've seen that fanfic but I wasn't that intressted
huh sounds intresting CrimsonOhoenix
but the thing doesn't stop just there
AAaaaaah spoilers.
Lyra does some good deed while stuck in this curse and learn some philosophical aspect on life while doing them
I can't say any thing more without spoiling though so I'll stop for now
o-o...
CrimsonPhoenix, link?
but seriously Background Pony is amazing and if it made me obsess over the story then surely some of you might enjoy it just as much
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/Background-Pony
Anyway gottago
I know I enjoyed what I read.
last day of job of the week
see ya
Cya CrimsonPhoenix. Have fun.
vye CrimsonPhoenix
oh
oh.....
Bye CrimsonPhoenix
I am watching recent fanmake of zero punctuation of Wolfenstein....
/me <3 Avast Octavia's Plot~
Me hate mornings .-.
Mornings are nice and peaceful Ponies47 D:
Me too Ponies47
I don't function well during the day
AdamTheDuck: But I'm sleepy -.-
Me too
Ponies47, there's a reason why I say "sleep is for the weak", weak having semantically meaning both as an insult or the physically tired.
/me isn't sure if semantically is even a word >.>
I'm pretty sure it is. :P
/me banishes AdamTheDuck ot the 5th dimesion for his indesivness
both the semantic meaning of an insult as well as physically tired* that's a better way to word it
Sleep is for the weak, indeed but if you don't sleep you will become weak
/me drags alexxm with him
so how does this map work
So the cycle is complete....
alexxm, magnets
/me kicks AdamTheDuck off him
Ponehs \:3/
thats enough for now
need food
Mmm food
i see ponies
Spike is best pony
^
thanks for the stream Phase4
Whoa.
A wild Meanwhile has been unleashed it seems.
i don't see no stream. that normal?
Unleashed. Way to make me sound like some sort of wild animal Ninjazz.
Eli, eeyup
AdamTheDuck: awww
/me throws pokeball at Meanwhile
/me Slides around the chat
Meanwhile, wasn't my intention.
/me puts Menawhile back in his cage and banishes him to the 5th dimesion
I never asked for this.
:<
Let's start again.
Whoa.
And now Ninjazz is Keanu Reeves.
Lol.
And now the father is pissed I laughed too loud.
Anyhoo, afternoon appropriately ded chat.
Ohai Meanwhile
G'day Englishman.
Hiyo Meanwhile
/me rolls around ded chat and meets Ponies47 along the way
Yay. It's Friday~
/me leaves muffins on the floor for AdamTheDuck and Ponies47 to run into.
hallo Meanwhile
/me sips tea
how are things Meanwhile
Uninteresting alexxm.
Morning time askewed Meanwhile
hmm what to do..
So Bstate is having a art contest huh? Hmmm. My art isn't all that great but hey it's worth trying or just doing it for the hell of it.
Technically it stopped being morning half an hour ago from my perspective.
It's 7:30am over here
AdamTheDuck: I have never seen his work :P
In three more hours, it'll be morning again.
Ninjazz: I believe the sun will rise
Look for my coming at first light on the fifth day, at dawn, look to the east.
dat LOTR..
Spectrum_Rush, not like I'll see it. Gotta keep the shades closed. Sunlight burns us. It kills us. We don'ts needs the precious vitamin d.
Ninjazz you a vampire?
Chat is now Middle Earth.
Ninjazz a vampaya?
Ponies47, http://fav.me/d5ger7k
And is it a coincidence that I've been watching LOTR for British Literature class?

Can't forget LOTR.
Shakes a spear. pfft.
/me gives Ninjazz a bowlerhat
bowler hat*
lol
AdamTheDuck: ya forgot the monocle
The highlight of the freaking day is when I can just sit down and watch hordes upon hordes of orcs just die.
Hark what light through yonder window breaks.
To be bored, or not to be bored. That is the question.
/me steals Ninjazz's lungs
Flashback to series 1 of Voyager.
As long as I get to keep my liver, alexxm, take my kidneys too.
im bored as hell..
Tell me about it.
How bored is hell?
i do not know myself.
and that how bored i am.
Like... bored stiff.
a bored board?
Ooh, yesterdays Two Best Friends halloween event vid is up.
what are they playing Meanwhile
i,i
o.o
Cry of fear.
Lol.
Didn't they play Slender once?
They've been playing a horror game every day of October.
Poor fools.
huh that sounds awesome\
It's pretty fun, if you appreciate their sense of humour.
Some October-fitting elevator music :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX5nDlafVEc
wut o-o...
I wouldn't wanna be hearing this on an elevator. o_o
Not that first part anyway
If I heard this on an elevator I'd probably assume my death was imminent.
agree
I wish there was an instrumental version without the lyrics
if I hear that Im gonna think its elevator to hell
When it picks up it's like the elevator has stopped on a floor where all the lights are out and there's something following you in the corridor.
lol
woah
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/9618342/Weighty-memento-war-veterans-secret-revealed-after-his-death.html -- forget all your arrow to the knee jokes... this guy had 6 oz of bomb shrapnel in his leg for 60 odd years
It just occured to me that I have to take an elevator later and it's one of those ones with mirror walls.
Meanwhile, D:
godspeed Meanwhile
Holy crap! o_o
It's fun looking at the endless reflections, then imagine one of your "yous" would lean towards you and warn you.
How the hell did this man live with that much pointy metal in his flesh?! O_O
o-o...
Daaaaamn, that guy was awesome.
umm i dunno?
well as they say... war is hell
A paradise to some.
Gah fuck this video.
Of this game.
I'm sharing this story on my facebook.
Chat is ded? >.> Maybe a fine lovely waltz will wake everyone up >_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33sf4G4JLmI
I'm sharing heart attacks with the Two Best Friends vid.

You just had to enlighten me.

oh god, Gold_Demona: DAMN YOU
I'm sorry! Next time I'll let everyone stay ignorant! D:
/me hugs Gold_Demona

/me noms Gold_Demona
I'm generally against ignorance unless it's for the sake of not being horrified by the truth.
I can't handle the truth.
Adam, y u noms meh :<
Let me live in my glass house of happy.
Hooray for glass house of happy
As long as my glass box of emotion doesn't crack.
Don't throw anything heavy
Or eles it'll be broken house of sad. :<
else*
I was happy in it until you threw a rock at me entitled "The mini Rarities have no eyes"
well time to play WoT
Hard to believe that's all it took.
Such a small detail.
I sowwy :<
its stiill good if you dont look at the little stuff :)
lol XD
Gotta run
I'm back guys, did I miss something? :D
Bye
laters Ponies47
Bye Ponies47
Gold_Demona at least you notice it first
But now all I focus on is the small stuff.
That's fine, I got enough of a heart attack a minute ago from this Cry of Fear vid.
take care Ponies47
Cry of Fear's scares get old fast though, Meanwhile.
:O dat Rarity image
This vid is almost an hour long so I hope you're right.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYtzqswlYg -- when you see it.... :)
here AdamTheDuck, jazz fusion http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il8hyQCqJ9A
hahaha it sounds like hold music when you're on the phone
love it
May I ask why it's called "fusion"
because it incorporates elements of jazz with rock music
Ryunosuke: I saw it.
jazz fusion is more of an approach than an actual genre, or at least it was when it first came to light
:D
during the 70s and such it was kind of like "lets take this weird instrument, and play some extended chords under it during an improvised solo"
at first I was "is that what i think it is?" and when i went back and looked at it... i realized it was what I thought it was
/me Licks AdamTheDuck
:<
awww
POW BEEEYOTCH!
that's funny

08,01Phase4: i think it's a wonderful idea
08,01it's a great way of engaging otherwise unmotivated pupils
Is this what I think it is?
kid321 pls go.
08,01TheRandomkid321: nope, deadly serious. gamification is awesome.
I mean about the age.
Ah, it IS Ego Trip
08,01what do you think?
Kandarihu: if its dexter then yes yes it is
/me is now curious
08,01we generally don't enforce an age restriction here
But I seem to be having framerate issues.
Satrn I just wanted to be sure. Here tell it's increased to 14 recently?
08,01but, content on the chat and stream may be unsuitable for those under 14/15
It's more like a warning than a restriction.
Meanwhile, "they're more like guidelines than actual rules"
Phase4 is best Keith Richards.
dat dexters lab
aslong as you're mature enough to have common sense then age is...
08,01AdamTheDuck: teaching by either using games or game elements

Corporate brutality, you know, for kids.

SIQUEWHAT
oh hell yeah
08,01dat hoof in the bg
i love dexters lab
Ninjazz, Great and Powerful (guy living in a secluded center of a majestic city) is clearly a reference to the Wizard of Oz.
who is streaming?
Ninjazz: probably, i think some of the wrters are the same
Lyra`: Scoot-Scootaloo
So Dexter got tall and then got back short. :P
Seems legit
Scoot-Scootaloo, be my husband?
08,01Lyra`!
00,03che?
00,03Nah~
Gold_Demona: that's how old people walk :D
*work
fine, Scoot-Scootaloo, be a jerk
Kandarihu, at this point, it's a not even a legitamate reference to anything. It's just a common phrase.
see if i care!
MadSurge: That is one HELL of a slouch. XD
/me cries
00,03:3
Pfft.
Ninjazz, good point.
/me 08,01pies Lyra` inna face
Gold_Demona: my brain works in mysterious ways
/me drips pie goop and tears
Ewwww
?
where did the stream go?
sad face!
Dat commercial break?
ah
oh yay!
Then again, it's pretty much the same joke. Elderly Dexter is effectively Oz (or rather the wayward professor who created the hologram display that Oz was
)
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
looks like a bomb hit
well the worlds gone to hell
ahah
dat houses
Kandarihu, I'll give you that. But I think you'd have to be specific if you want it to be a ref to Oz.
you know for kids
Wow this is worse than Fallout.
boot on head with big beard :D
Dem crazy people
at least fallout had intelegent people
:D
And guns.
dumb bomb?
goofy <3
Welp, places to go people to pretend to listen to, things to get out of the way.
See you folks later.
And then Dexter just made the tech level jump 10 times.
Cya Meanwhile.

I canNOT get over how Older Dexter sounds younger than young Dexter.
Also, he should have been riding his actual steed.
http://i.imgur.com/qwLup.png
Ninjazz: more whiny, really
Ninjazz: :D
DAT MANLINESS
So far, we've seen 3 different incarnations of Mandark. and 3 different incarnations of Dexter are meeting a fourth.
And the kid grows into ginger Mr. T.
LOL omg I vaguely remember this now XD
Ninjazz: considering a previous episode :S
DUN DUN DUUUUUN
Spectrum_Rush, "previous episode"?
years he dug?
Dumbening rays :D
Four conveniently sized wrenches
He was prepared.
Kandarihu, its almost like some form of time travel was employed
Ninjazz: http://cdn.static.ovimg.com/episode/268745.jpg like i said
Phase4, as if child-Dexter was prepared for this.
Spectrum_Rush, Hahahaha now I see.

God... Not Dexter. Dexter is fine but please don't mean THE Dexter.

WHy have I not seen this episode? I watched this show religiously-
Tis a movie.
Ooh, that explains it
when did dexter get a movie
Long, long time ago.
When CN meant something.
Hehehe
Vivix, did you watch it on Cartoon Network or did you just download it off the internet?
Powerpuff got a movie too, I think, or two
Cartoon Network
hey its making a come back now
Dem defenses
We only had ISDN back then
anyone remember that cartoon resort game
The PPG Movie was released theatrically. This is a made-for-TV movie
PPG did get a movie. Though it was a theatre premier. This was only a TV premier.
Ah yeah

Gold_Demona: the hologram doctor is great too though :3
That is a preposterously huge building.

I've watched every other series though...
Gold_Demona: he's a hologram, but he ain't takin shit either
08,01Lil_B: i think it's fucking awesome, to be honest
Sylandest, we could install red lights on the roof and turn them on at the same time and go 'look, Apple red-ringed'
My husband and I have been going through a lot of them on Netflix. Currently watching through Next Generation. Will probably endure Voyager after we run out of Next Gen.

docter?
Gold_Demona: I dunno much about the other ST series :D
MadSurge: I honestly can't pick a favorite since I'm not familiar with the whole cast. I know their names and faces and generally what they do, but that's as far as it goes.
<adSurge: All I know is Janeway's a sucky captain. :P
MadSurge*
Gold_Demona: that much I got it too :D
I personally liek Janeway...may it's her voice...or the fact that she got Q to fall for her
maybe

ow
Zoey sounds.
No more weekly episodes..Doug still is there, but no more weekly NC episodes/
oh, I guess you expect him not do anymore after running out of materials to "review"
Fluttershyfan158: he said the character isn't 100% dead, but his new Project: ''Demo Reel'' will replace it
That a Dwemer centurion?
that's why I put quotations
he felt like the character was finished after the "To Boldy Flee" special..He says that NC may make a few appearences in the future, but no more weekly NC.

Vinyl Scratch will be the most played pony in Fighting is Magic, next to RD and AJ.
Actually AJ and TWi will be a tie I think
As far as who is played the most
depends IF she's in it though
which might be likely
Yeah. If she is that is
Vinyl, Octavia, Lyra, Celestia, Luna, Dr. Whooves.
Derpy
We'll have to wait and see. On the mane 6's website it states that they have already predetermined the ponies since close to the start
