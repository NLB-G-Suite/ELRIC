I think Rainbow Dash should have gotten her cutiemark really stupidly
Its her wings.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Fluttershy during the flashback is noticeably taller and more gangly than the other fillies of the main cast. Also her wings fold like those of an adult pegasus and not like those of a filly like Scootaloo, or young Rainbow Dash, supporting her mention that she is one year older than Pinkie Pie, and possibly older than the other ponies too

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The timeline of Rarity's flashback is inconsistent. When she is working on the costumes, young Rarity mentions that the performance is "that night". Later, as her horn is pulling her to the gems, she's seen traveling for so long that the sun has set and the moon has risen, meaning the performance would have already been playing.

Huh?
So, if Rarity and Cheerilee are the same age, and Cheerilee was a teen in the 80's, then that would make Rarity a teen during the 80's, which would in turn make both of them... 40? Unless Equestria has had their 80's more recently. Or it's not 2010/2011 in Equestria. Ugh... This has been bothering me for weeks.
Which is unlikely to happen without it being said to somepony.

11random pony trivia: Before the episode premiere, the viewers had been presented with a trailer and a chance to vote on how they think Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark. The results had no effect on which ending would be aired, but were simply a guess on which was the most accurate.
So Rainbow Dash is basically Jesus.
What a story mark.

PINKIE PIE HAS ACTUALLY LOST ALL OF HER ENERGY
I've been here since 11:58. My will, it only strengthens.
there's luna, celestia, spike, and spitfire
This mindset however should be questioned very soon, thus leading me to obtain said companionship in relation with supernatural power that cannot be explained by ordinary science ways.
PONIES ROCK!!!!!!!!!
Sharing
there is a spike
RARITY IS THE BEST PONY
Said companionship included countless dangerously inspired events of a very broad and risky manner that should not be imitated for security reasons. Furthermore and luckily, an enormous amount of quite amusing and entertaining activities happened to come along with my dearest aforementioned companions.
AN AMAZING FEAT

gummy is a pimp in every episode hes in
but I let her have it
Until you all shared dispenser with me

At this point, my dearest friends, i must conclude, that the multiplication of positive social behaviour indeed is not a hard thing to do, and thus it shall be done in a very common and consensual way from now on.

11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The predictions that the ponies made in The Ticket Master are shown during the musical sequence of the episode. The eponymous tickets, which were so fussed over during that earlier episode, were nowhere in evidence during the Gala, nor was there any apparent effort to identify or control who was attending.
well, Excadrill likes to use Stealth Claws? Is that it?

For the apple family~
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: The musical number "At the Gala" is a sound-alike for Sondheim's "Ever After". This is the second musical number that takes after Sondheim's work, the other one being Rarity's Dressmaking Song. The song also may or may not have been thematically inspired by the musical number, "A Night to Remember", anticipating Senior Prom.

Diamonds are Heavy
THERES A STAR
A PONY NAMED PINKIE
11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: There was plenty of foreshadowing for the main cast's disappointments in this episode throughout the season: Rarity's slight knowledge of the Gala from her past gown sales, the snootiness of various visiting Canterlot characters, and even Applejack's own foalhood experiences with her relatives, the Oranges ofManehattan.

Wrong lyrick.

but the love is always there
it is working for me noiw..?
NewDCD: >implying implications that imply something but imply nothing, but I guess I'm implying nothing seriously to be honest
And my spelling is going to hell.
I also know part of the title song
yes, you missed the love. But there's some left
Of course. Love never dies

Vlad the Implier.

Aponymous. But I don't even understand
Sorry if i'm a little AFK rainbrodash, checking 3 days of Equestria Daily at the moment

Man, I knew it, that thing before was just a farewell party because you didn't want me around for KR Black.
oh god the monster came!
GEEZ WHAT DID YOU EAT, MISTER.

oh god he's clopping to ponies!!
12i think
Actually wait, I can't think too hard about this...
He better shave
But it may be a solution.
Fengor! Wash your hoof after doing that
12driving while playing GTA on your DS would be appropriate
he's a tad.... red-faced
That equation is nonsense anyway.
03no
03because you'd end up dead
dat music
that's thinking with portals right there
Portal
12results may vary
/me yawns
He's rapidly aged every lab equipment to pre-Cold War era!
12sounds like you'd end up dead if you are driving while listening to danger zone as well
creative. portals and spider webs
It's sabotaging Black Mesa
Misty would have a fit if she saw that thing.
DAY GREEN SCREEN
^win Edwardnewgate
Everytime I see a Portal reference I get tempted to post that hilarious Twixie pic... This fandom may have ruined me.

did it work?
see what did I say! FUCKING BAT COUNTRY!!
Don't worry everyone, we're just taking a trip to SPAAAACCCEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Go the farthest in Space. Be the best at Space.

NAWW SILVERMANE :3
03*really
9and that's how Equestria was made
03I listen to music all the time
03otherwise driving is just so boring
Getting bored of space...
that was indeed directed at you RBD! And everypony else, but mostly you
MFW Pinkie's cutie mark is Kamen Rider
edwardnewgate, are you space?
Aponymous I'm always tempted to post the text art from it, but it would fill up the screen XD
TASUKETE KUREEEE
Yes, son
This is a lot better than Puma Man, in the sense that Black is a hero to be actually taken seriously.
9DYNAMIC RESCUING
Now we are family again
xD
^win
12that's why you play a video game while doing it
10also, teal
03NonstopRam has made a comment on Sonic The Hedgehog on RetroGEN:
PU-MA MAN! HE FLIES LIKE A MORON!
03If you play the games long enough, you get use to the sound.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
12some people just love living on the edge
this show has so much jump cutting
03Somebody has no quality standards
DAT TEAL
Of course we arent ok!

9it's from the 80s, cut it some slack brah

lol, funny, because NewDCD has lime text

Jump cutting is what built Japan.
I KNEW IT! This seemed ridiculously '80s!
Why are we watching this?
10oohohohohoh
12one of these days i'm going to make the production of high quality sound illegal
Because, this is BLACK.
The best.
10ziltoid why the fuck not?!
Oh no you di'nt, Rainbrodash
12just to irritate drf :)
because it validates our manlyness after watching ponies for 10 hours
Because Kamen Rider.
Once you go BLACK, you never go back.
Obviously I am wrong
10oh yes I di'id dman
Because Europe
i watched Detroit Metal City on Saturday. From it, I have learned the greatest pick up line in history
Ponies ARE manly.
Because business
Because, this is now [BronyState Swim], and I wasn't aware of this.
>Implying watching Ponies doesn't validate our manliness.
10Silvermane, repeat?
xP
03um
03what
I'm going to fucking rape you, you pig bitch!
9Silvermane: you mean RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE?
best pick up line ever
10O_O
That's really creepy
Fengor I thought watching ponies did validate out manliness
12lol
12why did i misread DRFInPerson
FOREVEEEEER
It's a floating Pinata?
12as DRFInPrison
NewDCD! Not the 11-rapes-in-one-second!
10This looks like a zelda boss scenario
ah, apony beat me
wat
The effects really aren't all that shit considering.
:(
it does, but it never hurts to add a little reinforcement afterwords, Flutter1
he cut his tongue to do that
9JINGU NO TAIGO?!
Yeah, this is pretty good for the '80s.
well, drf in prison would be sad
because then i'd have to break him out
):
TASKETEEEE!
sooo, their plan is to stop Kamen Rider with shitty modern art?
OH NO SPIDERWEBS
Problem, Flutter1?
Plus made for TV
HALP
GOKAI CHANGE
9>implying we won't eventually
12we're kind of closer than you
10Polarfire I lol'd hard
03nah
hey RBD, did Reticentsmolder/photoFINISHHIM ever finish his story?
When does he Henshin?
XD
XD
NewDCD: Damn it, meng.
10SilverMane if he did tonight, then yes. but as of today he hadn't
Nelson
dat laugh
03yeah
that does not sound right
ah, alrighty. hopefully he gets it done soon so he can focus on his mane project
12yay someone backing me up
wrong pitch, wrong speed
"oh god why does it keep coming on us?!"
also, inb4 Mane becomes official synonym for main
12oh..
03yeah
12big help
10silvermane what's his current mane project?
9>yfw I'm writing a fic of Spike as a Kamen Rider
9>but you already knew that
10I'm intrigued
03The RetroGEN basically destroys ANY Genesis game's sound
Wow
even the Genesis emulator on the PSP plays it more accurately
HENSHIN
9SEIZURE TIME
Main? thats not how you spell mane! Silly Filly.
BANKAI - oh, sorry.
03so I shelled up for a Genesis Nomad, as even though the screen in it sucks, it's awesome
>Kamen Rider BLACK: Screw your seizures.
guile theme go!
03and I need to find someone to replace the screen with a LCD
06night :P
BAMF
It's ALWAYS henshin
03it's been done before XD
GOMU GOMU NO-oops
night espeon
Anyone read Fallout Equestria? Urimas is making a sprite version :D
seeya Xeli
!espeon
he's writing a semi-sad shipping fic, also starring Silver Mane, of which he and I spent two hours talking during stream a few weeks back about. it's where he got a lot of the backgorund and personality for Sm that he wrote
Not as seizure inducing as that one Pokemon episode.
:p
;p
10SilverMane that actually sounds awesome
Aren't they all seizure enducing?
Sorry NewDCD, black is a show you recommended AND i wanna see, but i've been busy and am now checking 3 days of missed ED stuff >_<
10Make sure I get a link when he eventually finishes
I would actually like to see that seizure inducing pokemon episode
Still, thanks for your suggestions and ideas of the shows, i have 'em saved : P
The Pokemon incident was the biggest of its kind to send a lot of schoolchildren to the hospital.
lol
RIP HIS HEAD.
he's offered to let us read the current progress of it, and at first I said no, but I think I'll read it to help him out, since I offered to help him with it as it is
Their heads exploded.
It was like 600 something kids right?
I knew he forgot to do the Rider Kick.
Aponymous: I believe so.
Lol.
and that is why you never see Porygon on the show
10SilverMane I'm a pretty beefy proof-reader, got a good idea for correct grammar innit :3
rider got Spider's Webbed?
and Caterpie used String Shot! It's super effective
10suddenly: dari
10suddenly: dari ruins the mood*
OH HAI DARI!
That minion done goofed.
Thankfully he doesn't have to pump up his Rider Kick like Kabuto.
OHAI EVERYONE
Damn, his music is funky.
YFW I've been here the whole time. :P
RIDER PUNCH
Moth thingy dun goofed
10idea... LOL
Or dial a number and put his cell phone on his leg like Faiz.
YES
Facon Punch!
10it was meant to say eye
Kabuto uses Fusion Kick...it's super effective!!
10but I said it phonetically to myself, and wrote idea
10let me off, it's 3:30
It was so manly, the explosion IMPLODED.
9I think I'm going to stream the Kuuga Teacher episodes
lol, i was so confused
9because I seriously cried during those
He kicked it so hard it imploded? Hardcore, almost Spike Tier.
I still love Faiz the most though, no idea why.
3:30? That means when I finally hunt you down, I'll be the energetic one since it's 10:30 here
Suddenly, explosions
SHIKARI SHIRO!
"Here let me get you out of these shitty party store spider webs!"
i mean, oh you poor dear, get some rest
10SilverMane that was just the biggest fail. saying english is a strength, then having ideas for grammar.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN! OHOHOHO!
aww shit
lol, my ideas involve many more V's and Z's
"Good luck finding a way home, fuckers!"
9prepare your anuses for Brony Tears
Suddenly, English.
I'm literally almost falling asleep here... night.
DCD: Wut?
Night, Bjorn.
10nighty night bjornfot
night Bjornfot, loves and more loves
Bye Bjorn.
Night Bjornfot.
oh are we playing the first 10minutes of UP again NewDCD?
Bye Bjorn
Question that doesn't relate to Kamen Rider. What Sentai Series does Power Rangers Samurai relate to?
9I'm playing something that makes one shed tears, but of the happy and inspirational kind
This time Bjornfot leaves first.
Hah.
10also, silvermane, if that was meant to make any sense to me, it made no sense to sleepy me
9Barry: Shinkenger
Night Bjjornfot! Don't get kickewd again!
9CHAN CHAN BARA
night bjornfot
9damn it
9he escaped
9next time Bjornfot
9next time
NewDCD: Ah. Thanks
RainBroDash, the English language ideas I have involve adding Z's and V's to more words
10ahaha
Whut about Xs?
10Xs for the loss
fuck X's
T^T
English doesn't use Z and V enough IMO.
Algebra can find it on it's own
not my problem anymore
is there a Kamne Rider movie by chance?
10V is used enough, but not enough next to consonants
Fengor: Multiple.
10I want more words like advice
Many Kamen Rider movies.
Seriously, Algebra just needs to move on and stop looking for its x, making itself look desperate like that
10those words rock
Advicate
;o
12D:
At least one is pretty darn good.
10Silvermane, you're algebra's x aren't you?
im a fan of word that start with q
The quality!
... yes
I just want to find a way to put Z in Defenestrate.
10crafty bugger
lol like im gonna get a ownership script ;p
>sad music of dying flowers
10NO
12you never know
AHH
03o
THE FLOWERS ARE DYING! CALL ROSE, TULIP, AND DAFFODIL
03*no
defenderstrate
03LOL
03'since I'm assuming you like Sonioc
03-o
i did indeed
hmm, that football says otherwise
soccer ball!
thats really odd what the music sounds like on the RetroGEN
The word's "defenestrate", by the way. :P
10Linkin Park cover of Rolling in the Deep just came on on tv. I don't know what to think!
03yeah
Z > All of Europe, u mad?
*troll face*
03but see, get this
03and I may have said it in the video
No, it's defenderstrate.
10Aponymous. I mad.
03the RetroGEN is done by some Chinese company, but it's actually officially licensed by Sega
YFW it really is defenestrate.
03Why would Sega allow such an abomination
That's when you throw someone through a defender.
superchalifragilisticespidalidocious
i know right
12i thought sega was gone
How can they cover a song like ROlling in the Deep?
Or something.
Lmfao nup
03the Genesis Nomad may be more rare and more bulky but that thing is amazing
9LUNA
no
I must find it now
9AMBITIOUSLY REVIVE
9LUNA
9A PROUD ENERGY!
they just don't make hardware anymore
03I need to find someone who knows how to do a screen replacement
9LUNA!
9A REASON TO BE STRONG!
10EdwardNewgate, Chester's voice is actually handling it quite well...
Goodnight everypony outb4kick
/me salutes this Luna chant
03the Genesis Nomad is basically the internals of the actual Genesis, with a TFT screen which is like a very primitive LCD
That's a pretty slick Rider costume.
03so it motion blurs like crazy
LOOOVE!
night Flutter1
10but it's basically all just piano from mike, and chester singing
9EVEN IF I STAND ALONE
all the music is great
03somebody figured out that youc an wire a LCD in there
9I WILL SURPASS THEM
9CHOU HENSHIN
03and make it crystal clear
9KAMEN RIDER LUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
03which is the only GOOD thing about the RetroGen, IMO, is the screen quality
10>LUNA
LUNAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
so it would be like a portalble Genesis?
Of course all the ones I've seen have been pretty slick,
10<333
03that's exactly what it is
inb4 Luna x SilverMane
03that's what the RetroGEN is too, it just sucks
whisling wwu
and then stew
03as games without sound, or at least without good sound = DO NOT WANT
9Also
10silvermane, fund it
winter wrap up stew...

mm, I have a sudden craving for chicken and sausage gumbo
So was Den-O any good?
9Den-O
gumbo?
liek gummt?
10Fengor I had this epic chicken pie for dinner. with mash and peas. twas amazing
I watched the first couple of episodes, it just seemed... too bright and cheerful
gumbi?
gummy*
9's only saving Grace are Deneb, Yuuto, and sometimes the imagin
i suddenly want thick chicken noodle soup with buttery biscuits
9but overall it's one of those PLEASE AVOID ME shows
Den-O?
Oh good, then I didn't miss much.
9Kamen Rider Den-O
He's dead
9that said
if you don't know what gumbo is go google it. It's a southern US food
Oh, that was the shit one you were talking about the other day, right?
and made right it's fucking amazing
9>Godai Yusuke's "mission" is to protect people's smiles
9>Pinkie Pie's is to MAKE people smile
Heaven Smiles?
9BEST DUO
FUND IT!
NO!
YES
10So. Who's excited for Across the Universe?
...
8|
No one. :P
I have no idea what it is.
It's like...
Glee + The Beatles.
Beatles Musical? How bad could it be?
Should I be?
Waaait. For the Benefit of Mister Kite?
No one from Glee is in it, right?
i don't get to be here this weekend. I'm going out into the woods to beat other people up with rubber sticks and bean bags
Aponymous: No.
What a relief.
The good news is, I get to ask for permission to create my Fluttershy parody character
That makes more sense...
10I've never seen it. I'm keeping an open mind and just handing in my man-card for the night and trying to enjoy it! :D (inb4 I hand in my man-card every night because I'm silvermane's bitch)
9DAT LAMPSHADE
lol 4th wall break
9SUP DETECTIVEBRO
10That guy reminds me of Freddie Wong
Aponymous: It's a tolerable movie anyways. Somewhat.
9it's more like painting the fourth wall than breaking it
10the old guy
YFW I quote this all the time now "I'm silvermane's bitch" - RainBroDash.
10Dari I believe I've said it before
RainBroDash, i've seen parts of it as my mom is a massive Beetles fan. It basically incorporates Beetles songs into a story, naming major characters after song characters
Well, if it's not bearable at least it's the last movie, right?
10MFW: *nocareface*
/me proudly pats his bitch on the head
Well that ruins my fun. *pout*
it isn't a BAD movie, but it really helps if you like beetles music
MFW: I can't read what's on the computer and feel like I'm missing something...
10I don't particularly dislike the beatles
9Sup Ameribro!
If it ends up terrible then at least we have Army of Darkness.
SilverMane: How did you like Bono's rendition of a Beatles song?
Army of Darkness is amazing.
no idea, it was 3 years ago and I only watched Hey Jude and Day Dream Believer
Eh.
eeyup, Army of Darkness is very good.
indeed
Still disappointed about the missing cuts in the "Director's Cut"
Give me some sugar baby
nice
Army of Darkness > All other B movies > A Movies
lonely motorbike
Evil Dead is one of my favorite series, even that not so good first one.
speaking of Sonic, i just beat Sonic 2
Also, RBD, Freddie Wong got to shoot with the director of the Iron-Man Movie. Also, on the Universal Studios Backlot.
9SURPRISE BUTTSEX
MFW: my teacher showed Army of Darkness in my Creative Writing class
the lottery is friday this wekk?
Well, Evil Dead 2 recaps everything good about the first movie.
/me is currently printing all 71 pages of Spark, the 8part+continuation-chapter fanfic
9indeed
12bark o.o
cool
yeah, Ziltoid. Hey
It certainly does.
10Silvermane: >printing
EdwardNewgate, fukin awesome
Rawr
10I... why?
i print off the fanfics for work
i read them while I operate the laive
All these fan fic references reminds me that I need to finish my first crappy MLP fic...
so far I have printed about 300 pages, and have about a 2 inch thick stack of finished, printed ficx
Aw, I'm sure it's not crappy
Aponymous, you have a herd (heh) of fanfic readers/reviewers/editors/previewers right here
10I used to have fanfics on my phone as .pdfs, until someone grabbed my phone and climbed up a tree with it, read through most of the stuff before I could get it back. He didn't find the ponies thank god.
I wanted to read this fic it was about RBD x cloud
I should try to put my skills to work on some fan project, but my writing sucks.
Ziltoid, it was... weird
I use my ipad to read ponies =)
anyone know where I can read it?
I'm stuck in writers block mode, I know what I wanna do, just don't know how to write it.
10aponymous i have no qualms reading your stuff for you :)
Why didn't you climb up the tree and get your phone?
it was basically a solo-pony-clopfic
I'm a longtime fanfic writer and I do beta-reading for other writers on ff.net.
10dari I did. but it took me a while
Zittoid: cloud as is the fluffy white stuff in the sky, or Cloud as in the main character of Final Fantasy 7
10hence he didn't find the ponies
SilverMane That's... awkward
a cloud
Barry, the fluffy stuff
lol
K
Rainbow Dash and a Cloud have been shipped
9you gotta give it to this show
9it really knows how to handle Atmosphere
basically, she used it on herslef. and LAWL using atmosphere
12lol
12;-;
Yeah, I haven't really watched this before.
Is that the one where she rubs herself on a cumulonimbus cloud?
RainBroDash, Give me your contact info and I'll send it to you when I have enough to be worth reviewing.
Wow. Is it just me, or does being really evil force you to overact?
10aponymous just tell me in stream some time :)
12whoops
12forgot to remove that part
Evil is Hammy
XDDD
I really enjoyed the mood of Faiz, at least in the beginning. It's unexpectedly dark.
Okay then.
9Faiz suffered a few plot tumors though
People going full cupcakes on their friends.
9but DAMN if it wasn't fun
10i mean aponymous if you need a skype or something you can have it, ha. just saiyan.
9fun fact: Faiz Paradise Lost was streamed in the first Brony Movie Night
12there
I see what you did thar
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes
9if I ever win a lottery draw
Wow, I wish I'd known about it then.
9I might ask for Kamen Rider THE FIRST
brb
12kk
My Skype is Aponymous. Add me when you get the chance, I hardly ever use it though.
That'd be pretty awesome.
9for Movie Night, that is
i think i might try writing my first fanfic now, or at least get the opening done. hell, right here even!
Btw who picked Army of Darkness? Cause if I had won, that was my first choice.
9AW SHIT NIGGA
a mod alwasys wins
10RBD mod never wins >.<
I wanna brohoof whoever picked Army of Darkness.
If I ever win the draw.... it's The Last Dragon. Because that would be a pretty awesome chat, right thar.
BTW, I are also writing ponyfic, and would be honoured were anypony here to read what I have so far and tell me what they honestly think. :3
if I ever get the B film, we are watching House (1987)
Definitely Fight Club
Hey, look at this:
i have time now, LexieSapphire
9MOTORCYCLE OBJECTION!!
:D
is this the third week of the new Eureka and Warehouse 13 or the second?
9MUSIC DENIED
Denied!
lol bad
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Kewlio SilverMane. How I show it to you?
10EEEEEEEEP new Incubus song just came onto the TV >:3 <33 <3
10I would most probably go gay for Brandon Boyd. Just putting it out there.
Goddamn I wish I couldn't read that now after what you said.
My A Choice is True Romance, My B choice is Killer Klowns, and my Episode choice is Dog & Pony Show.
well you could make it into a Googledoc and link it to me via pm, or upload it somewhere else
Nice post in pony spam
but but but... RainBroDash, haven't I already done that to you?
:P
10I mean 'officially' you silly pony
XD
KILLER KLOWNS
whats killer klowns?
if SF were google+ I'd +1 it
:P
/me is a silly pony
9JUST AS PLAN
from outer space
Ahaha.
the day I finally win the opportunity to choose B movie you will all be watching Poultrygeist
/me 10always dresses in style
sounds something icp whould name
POULTRYGEIST
Killer Klowns From Outer Space is a movie about Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
wat?
I ended up singing Winter Wrap Up to people over a stream the other day.
/me dresses RainBroDash in style.
10my backup B movie choice has been Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus from week 1
9also MAGICAL HEIGHT CHANGES
XD that's awesome
They blackmailed me saying they wouldn't eat until I sang for them. XD
Googledocs? Oh... (does Fluttershy face) In that case, I'd rather skip for now. It's more trouble than it's worth for a whim.
Killer Klowns is an A movie, though
I'm watching that episode right now in fact
Hah, we watched them all today.
Had a pony marathon stream.
10Lexiesapphire you can pastebin it :D
10it takes 2 seconds
I doubt they'd care. >_>
Well, okay. Just give me a sec.
I would love you if you picked Mega Shark RainBroDash
here are the pins we got
http://www.etsy.com/transaction/54392606
also, DAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW @Flutter-Face
10Then you'll love me the day I get B movie selection
lol I wish I could get away with calling The Last Dragon an A-movie
only we special ordered to replace trixie with celestia
Isn't Mega Shark the movie where the shark jumps into the sky and eats an airplane?
HENSHIN!
BTW, my reserve films are always Anchorman and Scott Pilgrim.
10GOKAI CHANGE
10Lexiesapphire Scott Pilgrim has been one of my backups for a while
He seems awfully... HORNY
Ooh. AWESOME.
Yes
9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
wow this villain looks like he raided Blizzard's copypasta tier armor vault
/me forgot his sunglasses
Lacking in Dash badge though. :P
10but since I always act like the cliche euromod, I've had a german language film ready to use if i get picked in the near future
9Fengor: this show is from 2000 though
yeah, you can mix and match
If I din't love True Romance so much, I'd have Scott Pilgrim as an A choice.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P53tt8m6vdY
which makes it all the stranger he did
How many people are looking forward to G4's Marvel anime that are going to are this Friday at 11 PM?
Is Human Centipede and A or B movie?
RainBroDash, do you think we could watch Shinlers List? or is that too dark and serious for this stream
B
12o.o
I would say
9Barry I ddin't understand what you said
:O
Damn commercial breaks
Die he died?
Barry, I would be if Directv didn't fucking get rid of G4
If we can watch The Room, I think we'd be okay with Schindler's List.
9oh
9wait
9G4 as in G4 TV
9proceed
Looks like Kamen Rider... got spiked
Yes
YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHh
9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
o.o
10SilverMane I'm not sure, it depends on mod opinions. But I'd pick Die Welle (look it up) or Die Fälscher (The Counterfeiters - look it up also) :P
RobotPinkie, that's not how you spike the drink!
looked more like bane broke the bat, but that's just me
Does the I, x... thing come from somewhere else or just that video?
If you're doing it right!
9OH GOD PREPARE FOR AN EPISODE MADE OF MANLY AND TEARS
Because bronies say things like that every so often now.
YAY!
I'd love it if someone picked Felidae, just to see chats reaction to Noir Cat Sex.
I, Robot is what I thought of
I watched Schindlers List in 8th grade, and none of my HS teachers believed me. Apparently 14 year olds can't handle gas chambers, peeing nazis, and naked old women
thought it'd be a spoof trailer
10SilverMane we watched it in R.S. when I was 14 too :D
If I won the A movie, could I pick an animated movie? Such as Cowboy Bebop?
9IMPORTANT DCD TRIVIA: The Thumbs-Up is COOLGUY'S/Godai Yusuke's most iconic pose
fix the window
we need to watch Fritz the cat, first animated film to ever receive and X rating at the box office
10ziltoid no u
still though
newdcd
OMFG I just picked my A-movie. Full metal Alchemist's movie
9he does the thumbs up almost once an episode
a truer tale has never been told than that video's story
10Silvermane won
Yeah.
How many Harry Potter films are A movies?
i still haven't seen it, although I finished both seasons
12what?
10barry all of them
12stop with the face train
technically all of them Barry
all 8?
the budget is insane on a potter movie so all of them
the movie is weird
10yep barry
How many saw the final one?
Ziltoid, which movie?
10irrespective of budget, we consider them a movies. i believe all other mods would agree
Lawl
fma movie
The 'PLOT'.
Barry, I did
The word plot hole is forever ruined for me now.
apparently I have read 114 fanfics out of 945, with 6 currently being read, on my EQD fanfic list. not bad, given i've just now been a herd member for 3 months
It broke box office records
9you gotta appreciate a show without a boring invincible hero
It CRUSHED box office records
I just realized I'm a 20 year old college student spending his monday night talking about MLP fics while watching Kamen Rider, my life is fucking awesome.
I saw the last one. was good, but short. That was probably going to happen anyways though
Aponymous... me too
12crash
ditto
Yeah, Part 1 took the bulk of it
i was at midnight premiere for last one
10aponymous I'm at my best mate's house, staying up after he's gone to bed, to discuss ponies and shipping with other pony fans while watching kamen rider
i did the midnight premier for part one
I saw it during its weekend premiere
for free
I was pissed when they didn't talk about Dumbledore's past
kk, I've uploaded mah fic to Google Docs. ^_^
This chat is full of awesome people.
i was at the midnight premiere for the first one as well
I'm at my college tech center, printing off fanfic to read at work tomorrow, talking about ponies, watching japanese shows, and getting shipped to other colts despite being straight male.
whos awesome?youre awesome
My brother and father got free movie tickets for donating blood
9also I think I'm going to reair today the first episode of OOOs, just because I can
cool cool, Lexiesapphire, you can pm me the link and I'll read it now.
OOOs?
"OOO"?
How to PM?
lol
Barry's dad and brother are also awesome.
OOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
OOO was cool. I approve.
03LOL
My brother watched it with me, but my dad has yet to see Part 1
awsome newDCD
click my name in the who's-here list
03at least we don't have people doing emoticon tripling here
03that can get annoying on other networks XD
which I have on DVD
XD
03:|
:|
03...LOL
;D
I'm back. What's on now?
One of my complaints is that Part 1 didn't explain about the Taboo.
I've donated blood once, tried once before then, and had horrible physiological reactions.
oh shit Bane's still alive
Sounds like he's willfully ignorant
12o-o
What is so funny?
o_o
bbl
Haven't seen any OOO
Seeyas
Which would leave those who didn't read the book confused as to how Xenofilius Lovegood called The Snatchers by saying the Dark Lord's name
Fengor just reminded me that I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DARK KNIGHT RISES! BANE MUTHAFUCKER!
Aww :<
She left us
03and I was laughing at you repeating my emoticons :P

9What do you guys think of HP Next-Gen?
Probably Fall/Winter, haven't checked the date.
This Autumn, I Think
I don't want there to be an HP Next-Gen
9should we get some canon insight into the next-gen characters?
Why does he remind me of the guy from Jikou Keisatsu?
Alright, first problem with your story lexieSapphire: You forgot to start it with 'SilverMane is best pony'
*troll face*
sorry, couldn't resist. ego is flaring up today
(why is no one talking?)
So, is Bane rogue? Like, do both sides want to kill him?
I think that would be a good sequel series
too bad Rowling won't expand on it
9I want some description on the next gen characters, but that's it
Arkham City is October 18-21.
9as in, not as vague as now
!pokemon
Harry Potter Next Gen? wat?
9as in "Rose Weasley is this this this, this happens to her once, ect."
Ooh, Arkham City!
Want, want!
wait wait wait, did Rowling seriously say she's doing an HP Next-Gen series?
10SilverMane I wasn't talking cause you killed the mood
No

Do tell NewDCD
Hrm
10@DCD orgyfest
On the 31 of this month, select people will be able to join early
I wonder why
"everyone explode now"
o.o
9a few short story/snippets featuring the next-gen characters. Not another series. Just...a slice of the life of the next-gen characters
12yes
:P
9according to my research
9it's pretty much Harry Potter: The Social Network
Like what she did with James and Sirius
I just read that in Dorothy Ann's voice from magic school bus
in that one shot
or she could tell us stories about the dead characters lives
MLP has made me appreciate Slice of Life stuff more.
XD wow
Sirius! When Rowling killed him off, the series ended for me. T^T
!pokemon
/me used Explosion
/me fainted

9you design your pottermore wand, you join a house, ect.
Yeah, that was pretty bullshit
early years of the Voldemort wars, school years of Lupin, Sirius, James, Lily, etc
9if it's by choice
lol I'm sometimes reminded of Azumanga Daioh when watching FiM
9Slytherin is going to be such shiiiiiiiiiiit
I want a wand with bitching flames painted on the sides
Lickitung
Rowling made a one chapter story about James and Sirius after they graduated
my "XD wow" was at the video btw

What has that song got to do with pokemon?
In Soviet Russia, Pie fucks you

I can say the same about Soda Pop
Implying we fuck pie elsewhere
by Brittney Spears
But what if Black Dynamite is really a tool for the man and doesn't realize it?
THE MAN JUST MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE REBELLING BY NOT WEARING PANTS! HE'S CONTROLLING YOUR EVERY MOVE!

That's only cause Black Dynamite is soo cool that pants have no effect on him.

This reminds me, we should watch Versus.
I just thought of something
9NEW DCD TRIVIA: The Falcon Punch and Falcon Kick are based in the classic Rider Punch and Rider Kick
IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE

Triple Finish! It's Super Effective!
?
Neat.
AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE!
I'M SORRY! I don't actually put extra love in the speical sauce! It's all the same old canned love! My boss just makes me advertise that! *breaks down into sobs*
The second video is actually awesome.
Fluttershy isn't a tree!
that's the same video Aero showed me XDDDD
I wonder if that's a nickname, or if her parents just looked at her and said "Well. she's obviosly gonna grow up to be a moron, let's name her Ditzy-Doo."
But she'd like to be a tree
XD LOL
it's awesome, but it makes my eyes hurt every time I listen to it ;-;
AHA! I KNEW- wait really? I'm getting canned love?!
