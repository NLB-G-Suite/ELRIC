I KNEW IT! This seemed ridiculously '80s!
Why are we watching this?
10oohohohohoh
The best.
10ziltoid why the fuck not?!
12just to irritate drf :)
because it validates our manlyness after watching ponies for 10 hours
10oh yes I di'id dman
Because Europe
i watched Detroit Metal City on Saturday. From it, I have learned the greatest pick up line in history
Ponies ARE manly.
Because business
Because, this is now [BronyState Swim], and I wasn't aware of this.
>Implying watching Ponies doesn't validate our manliness.
10Silvermane, repeat?
xP
03um
03what
I'm going to fucking rape you, you pig bitch!
9Silvermane: you mean RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE?
best pick up line ever
10O_O
That's really creepy

10This looks like a zelda boss scenario

The effects really aren't all that shit considering.
:(
it does, but it never hurts to add a little reinforcement afterwords, Flutter1
he cut his tongue to do that
9JINGU NO TAIGO?!
Yeah, this is pretty good for the '80s.
well, drf in prison would be sad
because then i'd have to break him out

TASKETEEEE!
OH NO SPIDERWEBS
9and not America, too
On the subject of the 80s, I suggest that we watch Fist of the North Star.

10Make sure I get a link when he eventually finishes
lol
RIP HIS HEAD.
he's offered to let us read the current progress of it, and at first I said no, but I think I'll read it to help him out, since I offered to help him with it as it is
Their heads exploded.
It was like 600 something kids right?
I knew he forgot to do the Rider Kick.
Lol.
and that is why you never see Porygon on the show
10SilverMane I'm a pretty beefy proof-reader, got a good idea for correct grammar innit :3
rider got Spider's Webbed?
10suddenly: dari

9I think I'm going to stream the Kuuga Teacher episodes
9because I seriously cried during those
3:30? That means when I finally hunt you down, I'll be the energetic one since it's 10:30 here
Suddenly, explosions
i mean, oh you poor dear, get some rest
10SilverMane that was just the biggest fail. saying english is a strength, then having ideas for grammar.
aww shit
lol, my ideas involve many more V's and Z's
"Good luck finding a way home, fuckers!"
Suddenly, English.
Night, Bjorn.
Bye Bjorn.
Bye Bjorn
Hah.
10also, silvermane, if that was meant to make any sense to me, it made no sense to sleepy me

03yeah

*troll face*
03but see, get this
No, it's defenderstrate.
10Aponymous. I mad.
03the RetroGEN is done by some Chinese company, but it's actually officially licensed by Sega
YFW it really is defenestrate.
03Why would Sega allow such an abomination
That's when you throw someone through a defender.

It's like...
Glee + The Beatles.
Beatles Musical? How bad could it be?
Should I be?
Waaait. For the Benefit of Mister Kite?
No one from Glee is in it, right?
i don't get to be here this weekend. I'm going out into the woods to beat other people up with rubber sticks and bean bags
The good news is, I get to ask for permission to create my Fluttershy parody character
That makes more sense...
10I've never seen it. I'm keeping an open mind and just handing in my man-card for the night and trying to enjoy it! :D (inb4 I hand in my man-card every night because I'm silvermane's bitch)
9DAT LAMPSHADE
lol 4th wall break
9SUP DETECTIVEBRO
9it's more like painting the fourth wall than breaking it
10Dari I believe I've said it before
Well, if it's not bearable at least it's the last movie, right?
10MFW: *nocareface*
/me proudly pats his bitch on the head
Well that ruins my fun. *pout*
it isn't a BAD movie, but it really helps if you like beetles music
MFW: I can't read what's on the computer and feel like I'm missing something...
10I don't particularly dislike the beatles
9Sup Ameribro!
SilverMane: How did you like Bono's rendition of a Beatles song?
Eh.
Still disappointed about the missing cuts in the "Director's Cut"
Give me some sugar baby

i print off the fanfics for work
i read them while I operate the laive
Aw, I'm sure it's not crappy
I use my ipad to read ponies =)
anyone know where I can read it?
it was basically a solo-pony-clopfic
I'm a longtime fanfic writer and I do beta-reading for other writers on ff.net.
10dari I did. but it took me a while
10hence he didn't find the ponies
SilverMane That's... awkward
lol
K
9you gotta give it to this show
9it really knows how to handle Atmosphere
basically, she used it on herslef. and LAWL using atmosphere
12lol
12;-;
Yeah, I haven't really watched this before.
[!Arcanine vars reset]
Wow. Is it just me, or does being really evil force you to overact?
10aponymous just tell me in stream some time :)
12whoops
12forgot to remove that part
XDDD
Okay then.
9Faiz suffered a few plot tumors though
9but DAMN if it wasn't fun
[!Arcanine vars reset]

Yes
YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHh
9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
o.o
10SilverMane I'm not sure, it depends on mod opinions. But I'd pick Die Welle (look it up) or Die Fälscher (The Counterfeiters - look it up also) :P
If you're doing it right!
thought it'd be a spoof trailer
10SilverMane we watched it in R.S. when I was 14 too :D
fix the window
10ziltoid no u
still though
OMFG I just picked my A-movie. Full metal Alchemist's movie
a truer tale has never been told than that video's story

12crash
ditto
Yeah, Part 1 took the bulk of it
I saw it during its weekend premiere
for free
I was pissed when they didn't talk about Dumbledore's past
I'm at my college tech center, printing off fanfic to read at work tomorrow, talking about ponies, watching japanese shows, and getting shipped to other colts despite being straight male.

Arkham City is October 18-21.
9as in, not as vague as now
