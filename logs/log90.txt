sometimes I just want to relax and unwind and not be p*ssed off unendlessly with an endless barrage of bullets ;P
ew some FPS games
(not including TF2 :P)
a plot hook? that's a pathetic excuse
this chapter is looooooong
they should at least be chewed out for letting him go
but I guess fpses too :P
he's barely scratched the surface
oh wow
if you want to do EVERYTHING though, it'll be closer to 60 hours in chapter 3
oh gents
I present to you
Dari's favorite treat

Yes?
lol Val
. . . 0__________0
or perhaps something more cakey, and cupshaped
mfw i had one of those
and it was DELICIOUS
and i was crying the whole time, in the shop
testes?
freaked out the owner
and a lot of it is because of the story
...
it was AMAZING
HAHA
02actually the more frustrating are the games, the more I play them |D
oh gods
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_491053&v=LcmBALxDkRY
02No gameover screen?
GGgala_ was too! but away from it, letting my imagination wander and make the story gorier...i would cry for Rainbow Dash. I really would.
dont click on that
was a mistake
02At the real arena
02URGH
U mad?
02like 40 tries
i no click but see fullsize : P
you know, epic yarn is easy, but there are other ways to find challenge in it
02but then success
13Ok, the downside to Kirby's Epic Yarn is that you can't die
13but you DO lose pretty much everything you've collected in the level
like collecting those coins or whatever
13|D
wait, is one o the characters a chick?
lol GGgala
i thought they were all just extremely girly men
>only just seen this. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTHy_W1jeW4/TksikgqkkZI/AAAAAAAAKkg/NGlXmQ4qTec/s320/mail.google.com.jpg

02(I hate him)
bandits just came up as a point-of-reference
well sorry, but frankly she SHOULD be getting yelled at
seriously
because it's fucking stupid
yes, probably, but they are trying to comfort the little murderer
another thing about the kirby games is that even those they are easy, they are at least trying a whole bunch of different scenarios and gameplay mechanics
no Dman, he dropped his pants and it's blinding the camera
:3
02Yeah, I know that
...mouce shaking is actually him fapipng hitting mouse
02because THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING
12Kirby <3
Kirby Kirby Kirby he's the star of the show~
02that takes me at least 40 tries to get/beat
he opened up robotpinkie's vector. calling it!
Meta is cooler though~ :D
I'm also comfortable expressing my utter disdain for the script
/me pokes Kirby 64 >.> <.<

crap..what happened?
you posted too fast
and triggered the spam filter
hehe..failed..
ok, that was a copy paste job..
If a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units).
Because of the delicate nature of this procedure, replacement of mouse balls should only be attempted by properly trained personnel.
Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist off method.
Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.
Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately
It is recommended that each person have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.
Any customer missing his balls should contact the local personnel in charge of removing and replacing these necessary items.
Please keep in mind that a customer without properly working balls is an unhappy customer

12oh well, more for me ~
and the puke scene
inb4 he "ands" every scene in the movie :P
/me 7needs computer help. D:
03well I just had one really bizarre dream
Hey Dari, send the link to the vid to EqD. Have it placed as news.
12where do you live? o_o
03and I think it's somewhat symbolic.
Me? In the netherlands
inb4 never. I really dislike most of the movie
12they hardly sell dr pepper... D:
Although one more thing. When the kids always says booby twaps
but that's it
mmmhmm
12England :P
sure
Neat :3
7Nope.
03hm.
The hate stems mostly from the fact I was forced to watch it over and over with my little brother. It completely killed the movie for me
03usually that means it's not attempting to boot from the hard drive, which is usually caused if y9ou have something else plugged in that's attempting to be booted instead
03what type of laptop is it?
7Dell Vostro 2510. o.O
03Dell, hm,
7Hmm, wait:
03OK
03that shouldn't matter.
12hi drf
7Okay, just checking.
03you can't boot from a mouse LOL
03turn it off, turn it back on and press F12 repeatedly.
03see if a menu pops up.
7Yep, I've gotten that.
7What happens then?
It has 512KB memory for special setups xD
03Quanyails, tell it to boot from the hard drive
03see if that works
Its a Roccat Cone[+]
03also wtf
03<bluesun2> now you'd assume they're male and female... but Vuljina are a female-only species
7Same thing. o.o
03hm.
03sounds like an OS problem then.
7XP.
03it may be fixable then
7At home, yes. :P
03where are you now o_O
7Summer SAT program. :P

/me 0casts arise
Nooo!
03LOL typical Asians
03I mean
03hi
03anyway
03there are basically two options
7Mmm-hmm?
7o.O
03If you have data you don't want to lose, however
03Windows XP has a repair mode built in
7I see.
7How do I accessi t?
7it*
twists he evil mustache
03you need an XP disc.
My win7 x64 had a feature like that too i think.....
7Yep, got that.
03lighty, no
his
03Windows Vista and 7 do not have a bootable repair install
XD
Alright
7So, as for the repair mode...
03http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm
03that should help
RUN PINKIE RUN
I'LL HOLD THEM OFF
7Well, thanks for the help.
03no problem
03if for some reason, that doesn't work
03assuming you have another computer (which I'm going to assume you do)
7Yep.
7Which is?
03burn it
03boot from it
03tha twill let you get access to all the data
03then back it up somewhere
/me eats sniper rifle

7Okay.
7Sounds good to me.
7Thanks, again!
03you're at a summer SAT program with two computers?
7Yes...?
03and here I thought the point of those programs was to study? :P
:O
03LOL
12mail the cd yet drf?
03it's more the fact that you brought two laptops
7And a few hours of time I have before my parents pick me up.
phfff, I've already left you
03Umbreon, I just woke up LOL
7No, one of the computer's is the buildng's.

12not to send the code with the disk XD
03why?
03I always put my serial numbers in the case for the disd
/me puts some facehuggers on his portable grill
So,anything happened while i was gone?
03*disc
03and LOL
7Er, wait:
Who's for hugburgers?
12disd~
World peace
03you tell it to do a live boot, which should be the default optiojn
03*option
awwww
I mean really,did anything unusual happen while i was gone?
03then all you'd need to do is go into Computer (same like with Windows), find XXGB hard drive, and open it
7'kay.
03you should be able to see all the files
well, I ruptured the contents of Rainbrodash's insides
03THEN you're screwed. LOL
7O.o
it WAS Sathi at one point
03wel
03*well
03do you know if she moves it around a lot while it's turned on?
Wow.
7Nope.
7The laptop's suffered from being used by multiple people in the house.
03no as in you don't know or she doesn't?
12sigh
12why does the DMV in my area
most likely yes
Hi Pega
I think i know why those burgers are unusual looking.They're made with facehuggers.
that's why i'm having testruns today
7Half of it some engineering programs.
12trying to get an early appointment is murder
best of luck then!
03Umbreon
03I have never needed to go to the DMV
03what do you need to go there for XD
if there's anything I can do to assist in the process, let me know
/me eats one anyway
03o.o
03I took mine through the driving school
Eating those burgers is about as safe as trusting Pinkemena.

0The first time I watched 1080 Ponies
0I was like
I'd be up for D2, though I haven't played in a long time
I haven't seen her, but she's probably fine
prob lurking knowing her. she did say she lurked for a week before an appearances to get a good vibe of everyone.
Any other ideas?
mfw now I need to find my D2 cd
hopefully online still works in wine
cool, I might do that
did it for D2,WC3 and Starcraft
works great, especially since my Brood War cd is cracked
I could also look into how I could stream aswell
Most def gonna do that
if needby
Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
suesan*
still need to buy WC3, damn
ahhh
back when Warcraft's story was good
become*
I haven't played the series much since the first one, lol
I know I have WC3 and Starcraft lying around here somewhere
well, definitely has been improved :P
Do you have any previous IRC experience?
you know, not having to build roads and such :P
I mean I've tried WC2 and WC3, but I haven't played through them
mmhmm
Not much but surely it cant be that hard
seriously
GREAT addition to the Warcraft story/gameplay
That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
