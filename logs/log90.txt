sometimes I just want to relax and unwind and not be p*ssed off unendlessly with an endless barrage of bullets ;P
ew some FPS games
(not including TF2 :P)
ValtheJean, it's called plot-hook. wait for chapter 3
JA OOBIOUSLEE, MAST BE DE MAGICKS
a plot hook? that's a pathetic excuse
well I was mainly talking about bullet hell shooters that i play LOL
this chapter is looooooong
they should at least be chewed out for letting him go
yes it is RobotPinkie
but I guess fpses too :P
he's barely scratched the surface
oh wow
this is a 10 hour minimum game
not to mention chapter 3, which is a 25 hour minimum game
if you want to do EVERYTHING though, it'll be closer to 60 hours in chapter 3
oh gents
I present to you
Dari's favorite treat
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/ZoigbergCookies.jpg
Yes?
lol Val
. . . 0__________0
lolol
U mean RD cookies
or perhaps something more cakey, and cupshaped
mfw i had one of those
and it was DELICIOUS
and i was crying the whole time, in the shop
testes?
speaking of which, the only fps that I've played that I really enjoy and have played multiple times is bioshock
... balls, cookies or cupcakes ,silvermane?
freaked out the owner
cupcakes
ah thout so
and a lot of it is because of the story
...
wow i just realised yah i would probably shed tears next time i eat cupcakes
02<Kosoveon> sometimes, I just want to play a easy-as-cake game <-- Doesn't apply with me .-.
(only just read cupcakes today)
yeah, they had cupcakes with sky blue frosing, rainbow sprinkles, and confetti-coloring in the cake
and it had cake batter injected into the middle
it was AMAZING
HAHA
Ray
02actually the more frustrating are the games, the more I play them |D
have you every tried sin and punishment?
Dman: but cupcakes was hilarious!
oh gods
13Well all Kirby games are relatively easy, what makes this one any different? :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_491053&v=LcmBALxDkRY
02No gameover screen?
GGgala_ was too! but away from it, letting my imagination wander and make the story gorier...i would cry for Rainbow Dash. I really would.
dont click on that
ziltoid yfw i didn't
02also Kirby Super Star Ultra
ninja... sex... party?
yfw chrome addon allows pic to expand on mousehover
was a mistake
02At the real arena
02URGH
U mad?
NOPE
02like 40 tries
i no click but see fullsize : P
you know, epic yarn is easy, but there are other ways to find challenge in it
02but then success
13Ok, the downside to Kirby's Epic Yarn is that you can't die
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOD DAMN BANDITS YOU FUCKING STUPID BITCH
13but you DO lose pretty much everything you've collected in the level
like collecting those coins or whatever
13|D
wait, is one o the characters a chick?
where every time you get hit you lose some of your stash
lol GGgala
i thought they were all just extremely girly men
I swear I feel like I'm banging my god damn head against a wall
>only just seen this. http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oTHy_W1jeW4/TksikgqkkZI/AAAAAAAAKkg/NGlXmQ4qTec/s320/mail.google.com.jpg
like Yu-Gi-Oh
KAWAAAIIIIII
Dman, yeah, that was when i died last night
SNEAKY LUNA IS SNEAKY
...died?
Sneaky Luna > Luna in socks
dem crazy oc characters
died from cute, Dman. from diabeetus
yes, of a daww-attack
happy luna > all lunas
only in a shitty flash game would some single dimensional female character need to be reassured the necessity of killing god damn bandits
Dman, all my money
Luna > All Lunas
O.I.C.G.G. ... F.U.N.E.M.N.T.?
ValtheJean, it wasn't about the Bandits, it was about killing Steele
02and the other thing that my friend said was that it was easy (for him, lol) was to complete at 100%
robotpinkie has the truth right there
02(I hate him)
bandits just came up as a point-of-reference
well sorry, but frankly she SHOULD be getting yelled at
Dman: ...my brain is full of fuck. and i love it
seriously
because it's fucking stupid
yes, probably, but they are trying to comfort the little murderer
02Y HE SO GOOD AT 100%-ing gaemz D:
lul
another thing about the kirby games is that even those they are easy, they are at least trying a whole bunch of different scenarios and gameplay mechanics
also new tab dari?
My fuck is full of brains... and the zombie part of me loves it
oh good, let's comfort the bitch that just lightning zapped an ally for trying to kill A GOD DAMN BANDIT
no Dman, he dropped his pants and it's blinding the camera
Testicle cookies?
hahahahaha!
:3
02Yeah, I know that
valtheJean, relax. seriously
i.e canvas curse with controlling kirby only with the stylus, epic yarn for the art design, mass attack for the fact you are controlling ten different kirbys
02I love Kirby games
dammit dari, you know you have to contain your sexiness
...mouce shaking is actually him fapipng hitting mouse
02because THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING
12Kirby <3
Kirby Kirby Kirby he's the star of the show~
I'm perfectly calm
02that takes me at least 40 tries to get/beat
he opened up robotpinkie's vector. calling it!
Meta is cooler though~ :D
I'm also comfortable expressing my utter disdain for the script
/me pokes Kirby 64 >.> <.<
come back when you start getting banned at Brawl tourniments~ >D
Nya
/me likes Kirby 64 :<
Did I hear pants unzipping?
<.< >.>
it's actually one of my favorite kirby games
02Manly should be banned
12^^^^^^^^^^^^
you probably did robotpinkie :P
12@Kosovo
02he's to manly for torneys xD
it was a quote from Brawl Taunts 3

And it gets confusing
13Guys, let's not argue
LOL
13please?

DMan: he's talking about how Durrhan must've snuck into other guy's bed and raped him in the night, since they're suddenly in the same bed by morning
but NOOOOOOOOO everyone just called me a gay basher
I called it like it was
and was assaulted!
i didn't disagree with you though

10'He was described by schoolmates as "acting sad".' <- What, do they expect someone who's about to kill themself be happy?
ikr?

10Stating the obvious
"he's gonna be acting unhappy...I mean, why would you do that if you were happy?"
exactly
YDC
OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH that's hwy people said 'catherine' earlier
10whatever dari says/does
10lies
10all lies
10rbd is pure
10rbd is truth
Are you going to trust the Uncle Paedosaur?
rbd is rape?
Or me?
10I'm not uncle paedosaur...
Dari honestly? you're both pretty suspicious
10I'm just a normal pony
... what?
10with normal needs
okay...
Who's acting suspiciously here?
10not rbd
10rbd is fine
Me, who's just talking normally to you guys.
10rbd has nothing to hide
Or RBD, who's telling you not to trust anything I say.
10ITS A TARP
10A TARP
And said he was leaving a long time ago.
are you talking still, Dari, or mike off
But is still here.
10ITS STILL A TARP
10dari is a liar, and a monster, and he is never to be trusted
10:3
<3 you too
/me is a tarp
oh it must be good to get RBD to protest that much. hell i dont even know what it is.
10and I just put a comma before and. Not to mention starting the next sentence with and.
10oh god I'm starting to lose my grammar
also, probably a trap if you meet silvermare
gramer
...
/me 10is a gramer Natzi
silvermane, is silvermare a trap, or rule63?
/me hi hoofs rainbrodash
<3 you all so much

And plot his evil plots.
Dman, Silvermare is rule63

silvermane WHEW
and ... what?
cure ?
but if you date her and she gets teh cure, insta-trap
D:
Ok.
yes, to return to silvermane
it's believed to be the effects of poison joke
so if u take a bath u become trap?
or regular silvermane?
or what
dari needs one more "thing"
you never basic attacked with her
make sure you are on the actual character who is wearing the item
thus hasn't leveled
you all are confusing the ever liveing hell out of me =p
otherwise, it shows the current character's mastery
so go to Emela to examine her gear
mardek to examine mardeks gear
WB DRF
10For a minute
10I saw the WB message had "<3" in it
Yes
10and when I read "WB DRF", I saw that as "WB DRF <3"
10Since when does HML include hearts for DRF? :P
LOl what
I have the hearts for you :3
10Good, I was running out~
/me passes a spare heart
lol, valthejean, you are right; but she gains some exp for every kill of the party, as well as for every action
Now we can beat Ganon :P
I meant with her little wand level....thing...
damn zubats

I don't want your Danny anyway :P
the skills on her wand? those are magic-related, not melee related
first time I ever saw a game with a quick time event as part of the normal attacks.
10And I wouldn't allow Danny to take HML :3
really?
I doubt he would :P
one is the spell 'bubble' one is a magic reaction to power up attack spells
there's like...tons of games with them
Unless .v.
FF8 immediately comes to minds
mind*
Well I guess there is FF 8 had it with squall but outside of that never seen it as the normal part of the attacks.

OH NO YOU AIN'T DOIN' DAT MICKEY
There's no coming back from the parallel world.
but did't she have the ear things?
:( Mickey
>mfw foreshadowing. MAJOR FORESHADOWING
didn't who have them Sumica?
Mickys grandma she had them
So.
She's old and blind.
It'd take her forever to walk to the factory.
:P
Years, probably.
dermathil - in japanese simon says 'drill is the drill pierce' stead of legendary english version 'CREATES THE HEAVENS'
Old people are slow.
I remember wathing something with the ninth doctor and mickey, and a city, and cybermen, and I couldn't follow it. Seemed like a season finally.
bad stock will be incinerated.
Dari: actually, decades
MANY decades
XD
soo oold
She's die before she made it there.
Razyn: that's... impossible
She walks too slow.
hahaha yea dari
Razyn: Ninth Doctor never met Cybermen
>9th Doctor
>Cybermen
WUT
Robot men, and a doctor with a shaved head
he did saw them
He saw a head
Razyn must be from a parallel universe
in an exposition
Robot men invading a city. There were no people.
...dari u trollin or something?
I'm trolling?
cybermen srsly old u no dat
They were just marching and looking for the doc and company.
Wut.
He said the NINTH Doctor.
Nope, not trollin.
The NINTH Doctor met Cybermen.
ok
No he didn't.
I know they're old.
:P
Maybe ninth, because that's the one I think has shaved head.
LOL YELLOW TRUCK
Lol.
hey
The next episode.
yeah, there were 13 episodes in the ninth doctor's series... none of them had robots hunting through a city
Bit creepy.

but reject this theme. I dare you!
So, I really wish I could watch that episode I described. It was the first one I ever watched, and I only caught the tail end of it.

GOD DAMN

Does this theme not send shivers down your spine? does it not make you get all goosebumpy? does it not?
>Angels moving onscreen
WAY TO MISS THE POINT
but I have crystal light flavored water, does that count? :P
GGgala_ all of my machinegun bullets. srsly kill them
It's like a magic trick.
whoever thought of that
You'll always want to know how it's done.
DAT PIANO. ME NO GUSTA
But if you find out you'll be SEVERELY disappoined.
this is a long ass opening
DON'T RUIN IT FOR GOD'S SAKE
this ain't the intro
what is it?
this is probably an OST song
ah
did they miss the part of Blink where the Angels broke the Fourth Wall by being unable to move even when ONLY THE AUDIENCE could see them?
I get the feeling I am missing somthing
valthejean - a sorta OST song with many themes heard

/me is listening to OST Baldur's Gate until the episode starts :P
Because he is fucking awful.
He can't even act.
valthejean y u no every star every planet?

....what?
He's certainly no Tennant, but saying he can't act?
y I no every star every planet?
are you drunk?
valthejean - name of song bro
He REALLY can't act.
no U
He can't even pretend to ride a horse well.

He just bounces up and down like he's humping the air.
And the delivery of most of his lines.

now with that being said
hair is fine, face is kinda Skeletor
man, I now i have to buy another one
It's funny watching Troll Dari rage
I'm prepared to offer a compromise
dari has irrational hatred for everything smith because he got too attached to tennant, not realising dr who is an always evolving show since 1963.
-i
eeyup
Hey DARI
haha
I am willing to say that Smith is shit, if Dari is willing to say that Caramel is awesome. He doesn't even have to say Caramel is best pony
dat british 'OH MY ... GIOOOD'
PONYBALLZ
I'm a pony now; Ponies are cool
he just has to admit Caramel's awesomeness :P
eeyup irrational hatred
mfw right now
I asume he's rageing about the new one, with a bowtie.
Caramel is okay.
(COMPROMISE)
meh, I'll take it :P

12a bunch of running exeggutor stampeding towards a city
so um, wouldt that be some kinda paradox shit. Liveing in the same time line as your self?
more like toward the carnival
i guess
12and team rocket
you were close
none, if you don't interfere with anything
it was said because that is what it looked like
Doctor Who doesn't play overly loose with the whole idea of crossing your own time stream
looks like he just explained it for me :P
Sumica, it is a paradox only if it was never meant to happen.
a giant moving forest
the doctor
12okay teacher
Like a fixed point become unfixed because of the Doctor and Rose being in close proximity to themselves.
INB4 Paradox machine
this was after Melvin ended up using Leaf Stones on lots of Execcute
U having a list of seventeen duvds? yes? how many lists you be having for your duvds today, sir?
(Rose's father's death was a fixed point because it was important to Rose becoming a companion)
>that theme
HE'LL BE DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD

I won''t do that again.
...
During this episode.
he says
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BAD BOYS 2
as dari still doesn't know what causes that for me :P
/me only owns three dvds
Sumica: interfering with his own timeline is only allowed for specials involving at least two different Doctors.
aaaand commence win
http://www.instantsfun.es/challangeaccepted
/me only owns three dvds barring sets

>yfw since, the doctor is only reading from a pre-written script, she isn't even talking to the Doctor -- she's talking to the time loop/the TARDIS itself
Erwin Schrödinger's angels
bet me I cant kill a stone
then how do they reproduce?
in the dark like every one else
asexually?
/me plays with the Octavia Bass player
They have nasty stone sex while blindfolded.
valthejean - just now i thought that they had sex without looking at each otehr actually haha
mmmm kinky
stoneophilia
dari - blindfolded, not seeing. stone. nope
Technically, it's playing a cello, but you don't play the cello standing.
AND DON'T BLINK!
then every angle came?
inb4 dermathil posts pic
>yfw I won't now

I don't want to ruin the mood for this bit.
hd
It's awesome.
!sneas
/me now belongs to Link for 11 minutes
...oh so now u don't want to >_<
don't blink brah!
I only ruin sad moods.
Because they're no fun.
ooooo that's in my backlog
And it's funny to ruin them.
so um cant you just put a mirror infront of them?
you troll
no it isn't dari. you find it funny, nobody here does.
jesus woman
Pfft.
DRY EYS
http://www.instantsfun.es/challangeaccepted

Just one.
That was weird.

just one means other still
BLUEBOX
Blink one eye at a time /episode
see? THIS is what horror movies are lacking these days
lol ya
razyn just won
it's not fucking gore or violence that scares people
that was my thought when i first saw angels too, razyn
it's fucking angels that can't move
valthejean i no rite. ideas that have never been done before, that creep ya out
That was my thought when I heard not to blink
also, they are made of stone, right? We have guns that can obliterate stone without any effort
ACTING!
YES
fucking brilliant cinematography
THIS SCENE
>still shot sof angels getting closer. WINNING >moving angens on screen. WHATTHEFUCK WHO THOUGHT OF THIS SHIT?

I want to find more of his work
stephen moffat
NOW LOOK AT THIS

Yes please

Even the doctor didn't know what he was up against, and dat look of fear in tennant
acting bro, acting

derp
btw dari
12rawr
you know what I think?
?
I think that they sold out with Smith.
It did inspire massive amounts of D'awwwwwww
Due to the Doctor Who going also in US tv now
Oh.
>_>
<_<
eh, that comic is kinda meh
..¬_¬
Kind of "Homer Simpsons" like
uh dr who has been in the US for ages man.
valthejean it's really good imo
That's why I like Harr Potter
Well I hear more about him since he became Smith.
Herr potter? mein vand is kaput!
J.K insisting on British actors.
meh, plays too much on trying to be all mushy imo
lol he didnt even say good bye
When Smith arrived, Suddenly I hear more about the US
they started showing it here reguarly sence this doctor here.
errytime =D
What I think is that it is the reason behind the green screwdriver
on scifi now called syfy
>green screwdriver
Don't bloody remind me.
green is more US than blue?
idungeddit
It is a change
also, again dari, it's a changing show >_<
Dman, the screwdriver shouldn't have changed though.
ohaider
QUEEN AND COUNTRY

OWNED
mad doctor is mad
I have nothing to say.
Blue is bettah.
just check the audio soundwaves
dermathil u think both good ? or u say green is crap?
LOOK UP BLUE SHIFT
Bro, A2 physics - quite aware of it
I don't see why they changed it.
I think that green is way shittier on the wavelength color scale
They changed everything.
The intro.
(not enough space in like 2 meters for that shift to occur thou :Pbut eh it's the doctor
The logo.
The Doctor.
The TARDIS./
The screwdriver.
wait.
Dari - dealwith. they done it like 6 times before this too u know.
THEY CHANGED THE BLOODY TARDIS?
Yeah.
They changed the inside.
"Your brain's been wiped clean." "Oh yea? So's ...*glasses*... yer face."
THE MOTHERF--ERS
dermathil - the insides yea
Dman, they haven't done it before on the new series
Only the old ones.
yea :P
/me gets on runescape
also dari - yfw ... 2 people ... got B.C. ... in the tardis xD (trying not to spoil, but ya get me?)

herdmind
TROLLING ROSE IS BEST ROSE

best traveller
EVER
marTHA
"The show's high episode count resulted in Doctor Who holding the world record for the highest number of episodes for a science-fiction programme"
no wonder she works with the doctor :P
marTHA is 2nd
"For comparison, the Guinness World Record holder for the highest number of consecutive episodes, Stargate SG-1,[1] aired 214 episodes."
yay~
figured sg1 wouuld be second
218 episodes total.
yeah
SG1s are consecutive though.
SG-1's got 10 seasons
Unlike Doctor Who's.
>Final SG1 episode
>crappy
of 26 episodes each
I was disappoint.
/me is gonna post some shiz. shiz no.1 : "Torchwood is mentioned by the police officer. The Doctor does not seem to notice. "
dari
agreed dari
>implying many episodes of SG1 weren't crappy
yeah ending sucked which is why they did a movie
fucking asgard fucking comitting mass suicide
so fucking out of character
But it was the FINAL episode.
It was supposed to be epic.
/me 's triviah: The Doctor drives a Vespa out of the TARDIS. This is the second time a vehicle has been shown leaving the TARDIS; the first time was in the TV Movie. This is the first time that a vehicle was shown to be kept inside the TARDIS (although the Eighth Doctor had a Volkswagen Beetle at one point)
yay for treeveeah
ep 200 was best ep well that and the groundhog day like one
all it did was piss me off
the Asgard are like, the fucking best race ever
and they give them the most bullshit drama queen ending
HORE SHEET
ahhh those people havent learned there specal tallent yet. so they have blank faces
/me 's mindblowing trivia : "It is often erroneously claimed that footage of Rose calling out from the TV set was recycled for her brief cameos in the Season 4 episodes The Poison Sky and Midnight. " ... we just saw that!
I played Runescape.
I got bored.
Then I played World of Warcraft.
I got bored.
woooow : D

Om nom nom
TAKE A DRINK
did she died?
YOU CAN'T!
I JUST TRIED IT!
sort of
OH MAH GAWD!
I THINK SHE DIED
LOL
/me 's triviah: The final rating was 6.76 million, making it the most watched programme of the day.
TAL' T'ME
The final rating of what?
and that's how the interrogator became the interrogatee.
>stands up
(dari, guess ¬_¬)
>interrogated becomes interrogator
(this episode_
) *
Oh.
TAL' T'ME (facejacker)
:P
D:
That actually made me a little scared first time i saw that
editing!
Is she in a morph suit, or did they just blur her face?
Editing, the game!
hmmmmm
clearly it's been shoped
Doctor is pissed.
DOCTOR IS REALLY PISSED
More likely it's some kind of face mask thing.
seriously, can I get on the doctor's good side?
I want someone like that who'll get pissed the fuck off at my face being stolen
A lot of the alieans are physical stuff rather than CGI.
^^
just look at the picture it's so nice
She had it coming, let's ...*glasses*... face it.
They are costumes most of the time
might have been the stream but it looked digital =p
The Cybermen were costumes in many shots
<3 foreverinlove with dari
YAY
Yay! More Feathers!
TERRY TIBBS
TALK TO MEH!
TAL' T'ME
that was almost a brick joke guys
!
/me likes Gilda redemptionfics that are done well.
same
I like most fics that are well done
yeah, if I were the doctor I'd have shot him in the kneecap :P
why cant we have his face taken?
/me 's Doctor Who Triviah: All the television aerials seem to resemble Nazi swastikas. On the DVD commentary one of the set designers mentions that this was done to evoke the post-war era.
I always thought Gilda could have been explored more.
I hope we see more Gilda in season 2
hmm, who will return u think for season 2?
eenope
ah gilda
Luna :P
I hate gilda
and trixie? luna?
I have one request: Luna
here's some fun trivia about gilda
Luna is confirmed for Season 2
she calls all the ponies lame
in our world
Y no rite -D
=D
a Lame pony or horse is shot and killed
.echo in every way possible
ok
there's some perspective for you :P
whoops wrong window
this is cardiff btw
Of course, I have a few favored pairings already, too >.>
Like Ditzymac
Appledash is my OTP
(Fluttermac is nice, too, but Ditzymac just seems right)
I here Val likes Caramac.
valthejean provided perspective. like a baws. or a certain french critic who's last review was of a restaurant with food cooked by a Rat ; )
Newgate: Appledash is nice, but I prefer Rarijack
rarijack? i see
I just can't see rarijack
Caramac isbest -mac
/me 's random stuff: "David Tennant mentioned on the DVD commentary that he accidentally hit the button on the sonic screwdriver prop while putting it into his pocket, causing the light to flicker on and "sonic-ing" himself. This is clearly visible on the episode itself. "
Only pairing I don't particularly like is Twixie, because I think the Twilight/Trixie dynamic works better as sisters than lovers.
But I can see Appledash working really well
I hear Sumica likes to pleasure himself while being wedged between two asian midgets
12then you played...... TF2
12and got bored
lolwut
valthejean wut
Who doesn't?
haha delayed rage
no, was just captivated by the doctor :P
>smart as paint
wut
om nom nom.
delicious pretty-boy
old guy in hat just craped him self
xD
I'm surprised no one's written a fanfic dealing with Dash being polyamorous.
poly what now?
FreezeFrame: that has happened though. With Braeburn and Little Strongheart
Basically, polyamory is the idea of being in love with more than one person at once.
polywhatnow
ah
well ive read one freezeframe
i can find if u want
Come on, bronies wanting ponies to be polyamorous, yeah right
poly- = many. amory = amorous = love
wher she in love with vinyl and fluttershy
As long as it's not cloppy
srs drama in that one if u want it freezeframe
or poligimous
not clop at all
want me to go dig it up freezeframe?
SONIC SCREWDRIVER OFF
OH SNAP
Newgate: If anypony were to be poly, it would be Dash
you know what, i dont think I have ever seen that woord writen out.
Oh, I know. I just can't see bronies wanting a pony to be poly
well freezeframe does that interest you?
Don't send it to me tonight
wow what an anoying gps you have there magpie
I need to sleep real soon.
lol
Lawl.
okie dokie loki
at least she left tommy's face alone
btwi t's really good
If I get any more story links I'm not gonna sleep.
Someone needs to make a satnav that just says "HUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Billions and Billions
Actually, you know what. I don't think Dash would be poly. I think she's a jealous lover
...
"GOIN' SHOPPIN"
well i am going around on runescape dressed as a frog and hopping around and doing roll on floor laughing emote and the reaction you get from people make it worth while
so did inception like rip the whole sound track from dr who?
dari that made me think of a reeeeaaaaaly deep voice 'huuuuungreeeeee' but can't remeember where i heard it. halp?
OH GOD IT
inception ripped off a lot of things...
ULTIMATE. FREAKIN'. SPIDERMAN.
>huuuungreeeeee
Dman: what was the voice?
oh'
Apparently the inception soundtrack is just the song they play to let them know when they need to wake up slowed down loads.
the new cartoon?
that gggala_ : ) and the videogame
the stupid new cartoon? that should never have replaced Spectacular Spider-Man?
the videogame! >_P<
actually dari, the soundtrack's got a lot more tunes than just that one.
you have to climb DEEEEEPER!
FEEEED MEEEEE
Well, the main one anyway.
dermathil u got soundtrack?
>dat piano song
just sayin', it's awesome
I ain,t got soundtrack. I got youtube. Same
Lol true dat
12i'd probably just throw snowballs at people
I already seen 12 tunes all from OST on youtube.
FOR QUEEEEN AND COUN-TREE
12?
/me opens up folders
yup 12 tracks for ost
yes
I remember a bit in this episode soon.

.....uh whare are there random glass insolatores all over that tower?
oh wow thx for reminder. let me get my snow globe.

...glass insuators?

/me 's triviah: When the Doctor is climbing the transmitter, there's a moment where David Tennant's right foot disappears due to a compositing error.
those
..... what is this sumica
Just saw it
His foot disappear
xD eyup!

Oh dear

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nooooooo.hig

Magpie Electricals apparently continues to exist beyond the death of Mr. Magpie; Martha Jones had a Magpie brand television in DW: The Sound of Drums, and a Magpie brand microphone can be seen in Voyage of the Damned. The new TARDIS interior, after it repaired itself following the events of DW: The End of Time has some parts made by Magpie Electricals. Magpie
apparently continues to thrive into the future, as a large sign with the company's logo can be seen aboard Starship UK in DW: The Beast Below.
mind = blown.
DAT CONTINUITY, Dman!
also dat episode, the beast below. tis awesome
12^^
gggala_ wikia! : D
i think i just cme
*came
lol
oh no, beta
>yfw the repair of the interior suddenly makes oh so much more sense to me.
Pfft
Crappy excuses to change stuff.
lol
WELL THIS SCENE SURE IS CONVENIENT
Suddenly the explosion in the TARDIS was caused by an instantaneous release of all of Tennant's awesome all at once
Luckily everyone gets a happy ending by complete coincidence
that man has the most blue suit I have ever seen
Now why you gon' be hatin' smith
not love 'n' toleratin' smith?
...youwhat?
you like seeing me suffer don't you :<
Why love and tolerate someone who knowingly shit over the work of another, greater man?
yea but that's, like, your opinion, man
DAMMIT ROSE. Quit projecting your daddy issues on other people's daddy issues like an idiot.
>opinion
>Smith just can't act

okie dokie loki, imma tolerate dat!
So mention of him sets me off.
12you are really special to me
I'm sorry.
I've seen only one scene of him.
When the TARDIS appeared inside the TARDIS.
I know it's not fair, but I just really don't like him.
okay, finished the newest chapter of Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying, so sleep time.
I'll make ya a deal dari
And he looked like a bitch.
I wont mention "you know who" if you don't troll with Caramel related things ;)

Dermathil: now you make me want to see Samuel L. Jackson and Matt Smith in a scene together >_>
/me bitchslaps Dman and ValtheJean.
Rage sphere go!
valthejean - voldemort?
yeah sure
hahaha
The best part of the current doctor is actually Rory Pond
I only want to see that if Samuel L. Jackson kills Matt Smith.
i...i am?
FreezeFrame: Lies
in before the lock. the locking of the doors.
dari: Truths
River Song is the best part.
okay like him or not, that would be pretty fucking epic
freezeframe hahaha that's pretty accurate
River Song easilly outshine any other character.
easily*
outshines*
just because ever since the bullshit of Star Wars Ep3, I've been meaning to see Samuel kick someone's ass
we can hear you faping
/me remembers the episode where they all dreamt up the episode and amy was pregnant. ... was she really pregnant then? 0_____0
Ok
This next 2parter is awesome
Dman: huh?
YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAA
Is it a 2 parter?
I can't remember.

Dman: I mean, i remember the episode, but your question, i dungeddit

Dman: No, this was before their wedding.

River Song is all I watch for. :P
wait, what was before their wedding?
>mfw I've only really seen the TARDIS inside TARDIS scene and Smith just looked like a uptight, whiny a-hole in it.
Amy's Choice
Rory is pretty cool yeah, but River Song is even more awesome than EVERYONE.
aww 'BURN WITH ME' is season 3
River is the combined awesome of Rory and Amy
obviously River is Rory and Amy's future baby
>impossibly
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 7 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then

/me hits Dman in the face with a hoof. (NO DONNA SPOILERS)
TO SERVE MAN
well, other than myself I didn't realize there was anyone who hasn't seen these
in reverse
i said 'doctor dona' and they said 'LOOK GAIS THIS CHAR AND THIS CHAR HAVE SEX AND PRODUCE THIS CHAR'
Spoilers: Something old, something new. Something borrowed, something blue. :P
wtf dermathil fine then
/me pouts
so now
refreshment would be nice, so would a change of shorts
if Dr. Who is a time traveller
people out of nowhere - DE MAGICKS
does he run across his other selves?
valthejean - no, but in 2 or 3 specials for charity events yes
he knows not to mess with that shiz, bro
so he NEVER goes into the same times?
(charity event specials can be canon, but mostly they are comical :3)
well what about his comment: "I've seen the lunar landing 5 times" or whatever
doesn't that run a risk?
valthejean - in a charity special he meets his like 8th regeneration, so his past self.
I see new people
apparently its risky valthejean, but it's time travellan, ain't gotta clue
Dman, you mean the 5th doctor?
Isn't 8 the one that most fans memory-holed? :P
also >oods. why they slaves? ;) ;)
Edwardnewgate probably
Dman: Remember this episode
you could have named it
It will be important
That's my fav ep
KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE
Your question will be answered eventually.
Freezeframe - i know what's going on, i seen em all bro! =D
hence wink wink
;D
stupid house-elves plot

THERE IS NO LIFE IN THE VOID.

BUT WE CANT BE!

if light cant escape it how come we can see it?
12he didn't say anything
I would like to quote shen
well sumica black holes are a theory
Event horison.
"If light travels so fast, how come it's never caught a ninja?"
Duh. :P
and drawings of them represent their 'aspects'
but yea no light so we wouldn't see em
and as i say they are still a tehory. to add to taht, this is a show xP
Valthejean my man to quote from Ninja:
how do you detect something invisible? by the effects it has around it.
^
so hand wave how rose knows what one looks like then?
she's seen sci-fi shows.
she knows what a black hole devouring glowing matter looks like
right like I said, hand wave =p
eyup
valthejean - speed of light? Pffft. you know what's faster? A NINJA you know why? Well, how long does it take light to travel from the sun to the earth?
Answer it ^_^
yeah
inb4: cracking password
s
considering it's been years since I took a physics class, I forget :P
like 8 seconds
now

I never got to watch this when it was new
again?
yeah fuck you sumica
^_^
but if it makes sense
like, I don't get to have the same nostalgia as people who watched it through
well if it makes you feel better it was old by the time I got it over here.
I imagine it's how I'd feel if I didn't get into FiM so early
valthejean but u can! if u watch now later u'll have sorta mininostalgia :P
in later episodes
well, apparently the one who shouldn't be mentioned sucks ass
which means there's not much reason to nostalgia it :P
Ootd

there's an oxygen derp
When the Doctor and Ida descend into the core of Krop Tor, the screen charting their progress shows 39% Oxygen. After cutting away to an overhead shot of the two, the camera cuts back to the same descent display, only now the oxygen percentage (which has been descending constantly all this time) is at 42%.

as opposed to changing the pressurization
well
removign the oxygen replaces it with VOID

10ah, red rooster?
"*something something* kinds of beer or something. Yeah that was a pretty good party."
Hell out here I have seen places with Redbull and Jeger on tap.
10i tell you what you need to try, down in spoons they do a thing called a skittlebomb
nope
Heh
10it's a shot of Cointreau (an orange liqueur) in a shot of energy drink
Then again i dont drink but will gladly torment the drunk.
10DARI
10I MAKE AND SELL SKITTLES VODKA
10ITS THE SHIT
10YEAH

Sumica, yes. Just, yes. :D
10I made my own suction-filtration system
10it was fucking win
10ahh the good old days
10it's been so long
10basically, skittles vodka is dirrrty because if you get just the right amount of skittles it doesn't even taste alcoholic
Sure win bet. Bet them they cant eat a spoon full of cinnamon
10it's like that, but even more sugary xD
then again that is a sure win with any one
10tbh, WKD does work well for strawpedos. since it's not as fizzy
10as like beer or w/e
10oh yeah, you mentioned that one with gin in it
10i forgot what it was now
10that one
Some where around here i have my mixoligist guide that I got from culinary school.

Culinary mixologist guide...

10ah yeah, my friend made one of those for me
10different colours though
I love mixed drinks, never really bothered with the heavy stuff.

10:3

10but fuck that shit
How tall are you rainbro?
then again I dont realy know all the rules to it. It just looks like a game of smear the quere to me.
We never played Rugby, yet our school had a Rugby team. :/

How tall are you dari?
10smear the queer. lol. at least we don't wear pads in our contact sports ;D

it's not a bash on rugby was just a game we played in Jr high on breaks
10oh win
10my surname is davies. in my boarding house there was a dorm sport called BTD at one point
10it stood for Beat The Davies
10good times
:D
taht was just the name it had. point was to be the man with the ball and not get your ass handed to you.
10meh, a bit of roughing up brings character
10and sumica fair enough :P
I really need some caffeine. Its only 2 here but I'm really tired for some reason.

crap..what happened?
you posted too fast
and triggered the spam filter
hehe..failed..
ok, that was a copy paste job..
i will be slower
If a mouse fails to operate or should it perform erratically, it may need a ball replacement. Mouse balls are now available as FRU (Field Replacement Units).
Before proceeding, determine the type of mouse balls by examining the underside of the mouse. Domestic balls will belarger and harder than foreign balls.
Ball removal procedures differ depending upon the manufacturer of the mouse. Foreign balls can be replaced using the pop off method. Domestic balls are replaced by using the twist off method.
Mouse balls are not usually static sensitive. However, excessive handling can result in sudden discharge.
Upon completion of ball replacement, the mouse may be used immediately
It is recommended that each person have a pair of spare balls for maintaining optimum customer satisfaction.
Any customer missing his balls should contact the local personnel in charge of removing and replacing these necessary items.
Please keep in mind that a customer without properly working balls is an unhappy customer

joan had just got a job at the ticke-me-elmo factory and was told to report to work the following morning, about 10am the following day the floor supervisor went to
the manager.
furious, he said "that new lady, joan, she
has to go, we are falling so far behind in production i dont know what to do."
so the manager went down to the production room and was horified to find the line backed up everywhere, and he watched joan grab a piece of red material used for making the tickle-me-elmo
put 2 marbles in it and sew the little sac between elmo's legs. after regaining his composure the manager went over to joan and said, dear,
i thing you mis-understood what you are
to do, your job is to give elmo "two test tickles"
......END....

Damn brah, you have my sympathy.
We start so early here.
But apparently this year we get Fridays off in April and May.
hey, anybody still around?
8 fridays off
It's awesome.
It makes weekend plans better
But think about it
It's the 18th
I'm not going back til the 8th
They gipped you out of 20 days, and only gave you 8 back
But granted, I would enjoy Fridays off
School also ends June 6th
Or is it June 8th
There, that makes it kinda better
Did you get your school supplies?
Were you sure to get new clothes?
Are you smelling nice for the plethora of hot teenage females?
Yep
You're not wearing anything too tight to show off the buldge you're going to get from seeing said plethora of hot females for the first time in months?
Nope
New bus driver sucks
How deep?
Bad thing is I know her
Well fudge it

Sit in the back with the cool kids
Boys on one side girls on the other
Fucker
Wait

that*
Are you seriously?
Yes
An no soda
And*
That's fucking hilarious
Dickslap her.
You're in high school and they're doing that?
They weren't even doing that when I was in elementary school
rofl
To all the grades bro
It's not a highschool bus
What?
All the grades ride this bus
K-12
Dickslap them all.
With your penis.

hi rodman
It's so nostalgic for me.
It brings me back to the first Sonic game i ever played.
Sonic Heroes was BAWS back then.
It still is.
Most of it due to nostalgia.
Weird, I don't recall this song
/me is looking through hair styling general for his fluttershy <3
You sure its a Sonic Heroes' song?
"What i'm made of",the final boss song from Sonic Heroes.
Ah, vs Metal Sonic
I remember now
never played sonice heroes
MEGA Metal Sonic.
when was it released?
MEGA Metal Sonic. Trufax
2005.
Oh.
Or was it 2003?
nope
I don't remember.I'mma check Wikipedia.
The last sonic game I played was on the gamecube
its was called sonic battle 2 or something
And you fought a giant space monster
tentacle
Sonic Heroes was released in 2004.
space parasite
thing
best sonic theme?
(impossibru questoin i knkow)
Best Sonic theme,or Best Sonic song?
Hmmm
brb
let's start with song
What i'm made is the best Sonic song in my opinion.
*What i'm made of
I CAN'T BRAIN TODAY.
Personally I'm biased to Escape From the City
02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
Escape from the City is quite good.The first time i heard it was in the Sega Superstars trailer.
I felt so BAWS when i beat Sonic Heroes for the first time.
I felt UBERBAWS when i beat Killer Instinct for the first time(the SNES version).

Ohai Sathi

It would taste like luna.
ancient horse taste ftw!
Moonpie anyone?
And then the Space Core showed up.
Moonpie sounds delicious
And the Duke
Chaos is happening because i killed Pinkemena.
Somehow, that let other realities slip in

At least you didn't kill Pinkamena
*Yeah.

13The back of my legs are aching from too much walking yesterday .w.
BTW, RP, did you or Dman email Seth to have the vid up in EQd? Cuz if not, I'm doing that right now
12and for no reason that I can recall when I move my left hand my elbow hurts ;w;
I haven't, I thought Dari was planning on doing that
12Dr pepper will help me recover >P
13Tip: don't move your left hand :3
12but I type with both hands =(
and Dman hasn't, I don't think
13Type with one hand~
12but that delays my messages >o
13DEAL WITH IT
Hmmm, should I hold and let Dari do it?
12NO, YOU HAVE NO SHADES
Does anypony know what other dimensions will enter in this one?
Where is Dari?
Dunno

Once you reach 100%, you can unleash some kind of super attack.

I totally know what my super attack will be called
@emptymeter Razyn
6 Razyn is 17% empty. (1514)
KARAMERU PAAAAAAAAAAAANCHI?

Just flipped a coin, and that came up
7Razyn, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
was technically going to make it Crunch, but I like punch now :P
Very well.
lol
7Do you have any questions before we start?
I kinda like the Crunch, too, that'd work
No.
7How many movienights have you attended so far?

True
All but two.
>mfw Caramel is included in that FiM fighting game

see you later then Hip
No, nothing that really counts.
mfw I have 2 earlier versions
At least nothing like BMN
7I see
7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
I only have 1... or well, 1 and then an earlier render of this

HAHA, amazing
Leaving BMN itself as is would most likely be for the best. But having events every now and then, like the upcoming LoTR, is the perfect way to garner more viewers. Perhaps seasonal events i.e. monster movie marathon in Halloween.
Don't Stop Me Now FTWMFW
-would be fun.
7Any other ideas?
No, not at the moment.
Best Queen song
7Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
The stream on?
I just want to help in any way I can. BMN has become a big part of my life, and if there's anything I can do to ensure it stays up and running a smoothly as possible, then I want in.
Nope, not right now.

haven't beaten Brutal Legend yet actually
I really should
>Ninja WOONA
Tim curry is baws
I thought Brutal Legend was cool. Then Through the Fire and Flames was added to my list of music. Now I think it is awesome.
I've beaten it... It's alright... I just had hoped for more.
12still a bit irritated
@Ziltoid how much of Metalocalypse have you seen
@Razyn ung...Dragonforce....
ewwww.jpg
I mean Psychonauts was just mindblowingly awesome

well, I'll say this much
Season 3's ending was epic
season 2s ending was cool too

I'm just saying, Dragonforce is the gateway band

yfw You should see them live, they're much better live
when you first hear them, it's all cool and trippy
but there's no many BETTER things out there
this is just the beginning

take advice from grandpa kids:
Also val, trance is much better than dubstep
stay away from drugs

though delightful irony is I'm more afraid of angels than satan
12I can't its witheld ._.
Ouch
10@ValtheJean now we need to get you hooked on Primeval...
eh Robotpinkie, I thoroughly enjoy it, but I probably wont go out of my way to watch it
yeah that wont happen
saw the pilot
hated it

sorry, not a fan of terrible acting :P
12but I can't talk to that person LOL garh.
Now we need to get Val hooked on my personal favorite show
They change the dynamic of the show ALOT.
*whistles*
12Next time it happens I'll just state who I think it is
all this attention to me ey? When do I get to hook you lot on MY shows, ey? :P
My favorite show is something called "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"

who the hell likes Ponies? jeez
RobotPinkie, don't bother. I'm pretty sure he's not gonna latch onto it.
I know it sounds girly, but if you give it a chance it's really quite good
seriously, anyone who watches it should immediately lose their mancard
12do you have a Last-call return feature?
Aw okay, yeah I guess that was a bit of a reach. :(
>is EXACTLY what I said to people before becoming a FiM fan btw
12I do, but all it says is "withheld"
well, the mancard part
not the others
12hmm

OMG GUISE, I FUKKEN LOVE PONIES
10valthejean, I'm pretty much abandoning ponies when i go off to uni
I just thought bronies sounded.... really not like my kind of people :P
12The fact that they're withholding their number increases the chances that I already have them saved on my contacts
12or its just a number they don't want me to have
whaaaaaaaaaa?
12but still wtf is the point in hanging up if I answer it .w.
why Rainbro????
Ponies will still love you rainbro

12maybe, I kept record of two dates so far 8th, 18th August but it's happened before as well
10Well it's gonna be a long hard process of making great uni friends and really finding a crew that I can bond with.. Things like 'LOL I STAY UP TILL 5AM WATCHING PONIES WITH RANDOM PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET XD' don't go down too well as first impressions >.>

12oh well, more for me ~

03well I just had one really bizarre dream
Hey Dari, send the link to the vid to EqD. Have it placed as news.
12where do you live? o_o
03and I think it's somewhat symbolic.
Me? In the netherlands
12yeah, ah I see owo
inb4 never. I really dislike most of the movie
12they hardly sell dr pepper... D:
7Okay, well, my parents' laptop boots and ends up on a screen without any options, just a _ cursor like the command prompt.
Although one more thing. When the kids always says booby twaps
Were do you come from soital?
7Pressing keys gets the laptop to beep.
but that's it
mmmhmm
12England :P
sure
03do you have a CD in the drive or a flash drive plugged in?
Neat :3
7Nope.
03hm.
The hate stems mostly from the fact I was forced to watch it over and over with my little brother. It completely killed the movie for me
03usually that means it's not attempting to boot from the hard drive, which is usually caused if y9ou have something else plugged in that's attempting to be booted instead
03what type of laptop is it?
7Dell Vostro 2510. o.O
03Dell, hm,
7Hmm, wait:
7I have a USB mouse attatched to the laptop.
03OK
03that shouldn't matter.
12hi drf
7Okay, just checking.
03you can't boot from a mouse LOL
03OK so
03turn it off, turn it back on and press F12 repeatedly.
03see if a menu pops up.
My pc CAN boot from my mouse
7Yep, I've gotten that.
7What happens then?
03<lighty> My pc CAN boot from my mouse <- What the frick?
It has 512KB memory for special setups xD

03> wtf bluesun2?
03<bluesun2> latest ep showed two Vuljina/Mandibuzz sharing a nest, one larger with a deep voice, and one smaller with a higher voice
03<bluesun2> now you'd assume they're male and female... but Vuljina are a female-only species
7Same thing. o.o
Holy...
7Black screen, _ like the command prompt.
03hm.

7At home, yes. :P
03where are you now o_O
7Summer SAT program. :P
I killed it
/me 0casts arise
Nooo!
03LOL typical Asians
03I mean
03hi
03anyway
03there are basically two options
what?
7Mmm-hmm?
the chat died
03that blinking cursor means either your hard drive or the operating system is corrupted.
03The easiest is to just lose all data and reinstall Windows.
7o.O
03If you have data you don't want to lose, however
/me gives chat mouth to mouth
03Windows XP has a repair mode built in
03which is why I asked what version, as XP is the latest one to have that feature
03where it will attempt to fix your OS without erasing data.
7I see.
0It's not dead, it just has low health
7How do I accessi t?
7it*
twists he evil mustache
03you need an XP disc.
My win7 x64 had a feature like that too i think.....
7Yep, got that.
03lighty, no
his
/me stabs chat. Mistaking it for Durrgarr
03Windows Vista and 7 do not have a bootable repair install
03it really seems stupid because if you break your OS< you're SOL
XD
ohai house stream, when did you happen?
03you can do a repair installation with 7 but you have to be able to boot into Windows first, which in this case...
Alright
7So, as for the repair mode...
RobotPinkie, I've come for my check. Now spit it out ya wanker!
03that should help
RUN PINKIE RUN
I'LL HOLD THEM OFF
0>Now spit it out yer wanker!
/me 7saves that link for when she gets home.
7Well, thanks for the help.
03no problem
03if for some reason, that doesn't work
7Annoyed that my mom continues to not want to back up her data elsewhere. >>
03assuming you have another computer (which I'm going to assume you do)
03you can do what I usually do
7Yep.
03which is download a Linux CD
7Which is?
03burn it
03boot from it
03tha twill let you get access to all the data
03then back it up somewhere
03external hard drive, flash drive, whatever
Problem solved
03then reinstall WIndows the normal way.
7Hmm!
phfff...fine then
03^ that's also the reason why Windows passwords are 100% useless
I wont die heroically for you
7So how do I get a Linux CD/burn one? :P
/me 10eats ValtheJean
Oh, you'd do that for me?
....hot
10... oh lawdy~
/me bursts from Rainbrodash's stomach
10^ win
/me thinks
Oh lulz
yeah, shoulda mentioned I'm half Xenomorph
03the catch is, most Linux versions don't like laptop wireless which means you couldn't get online
03if you can get online, you can use Mibbit as usual :P
03so m
03*hm'
10shiit
Even hotter!
03http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/9.04/ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso
03just go with that
7That's the CD?
/me traps RobotPinkie in the facehugger room
03yeah
7Okay, burn that simply onto a CD, and then what?
03put it in the laptop, use F12 again, and this time press boot from CD
7Okay.
03also LOL what
7Sounds good to me.
7Thanks, again!
03you're at a summer SAT program with two computers?
7Yes...?
03and here I thought the point of those programs was to study? :P
:O
7This is after the class. :P
please stream something, dari, before he gets me!
03LOL
12mail the cd yet drf?
03it's more the fact that you brought two laptops
7And a few hours of time I have before my parents pick me up.
phfff, I've already left you
03Umbreon, I just woke up LOL
7No, one of the computer's is the buildng's.
you've got facehuggers to deal with mate
03I'm gonna go to the post office in like an hour
03ah
7building's*
12ahh, i was going to suggest
I HAVE RETURNED.
lies
12not to send the code with the disk XD
03too late
03why?
12incase someone else gets the mail for whatever reason
Im off, gnite all
03I always put my serial numbers in the case for the disd
/me puts some facehuggers on his portable grill
So,anything happened while i was gone?
03*disc
03and LOL
7Er, wait:
03well for what it's worth, Umbreon, I have never had any mail stolen
Who's for hugburgers?
12disd~
World peace
7When I boot up the linux CD, what do I do then?
03you tell it to do a live boot, which should be the default optiojn
03*option
awwww
I mean really,did anything unusual happen while i was gone?
who is streaming?
03then all you'd need to do is go into Computer (same like with Windows), find XXGB hard drive, and open it
7'kay.
03and assuming the hard drive itself is not broken
03you should be able to see all the files
well, I ruptured the contents of Rainbrodash's insides
03if it gives you some error and the drive won't open
03THEN you're screwed. LOL
7O.o
it WAS Sathi at one point
7Well, that stinks for my mom. :P
03well no. Nothing on a computer is ever permanently broken. Buy yeah
03wel
03*well
And apparently RobotPinkie cooked us some unusual looking burgers
03do you know if she moves it around a lot while it's turned on?
Wow.
/me needs to get stuff fixed before tomorrow..
7Nope.
ah, will you be streaming on friday then?
7The laptop's suffered from being used by multiple people in the house.
03no as in you don't know or she doesn't?
12sigh
12why does the DMV in my area
7And had a lot of junk and stuff on it.
most likely yes
Hi Pega
12have to be like the only DMV for miles
I think i know why those burgers are unusual looking.They're made with facehuggers.
that's why i'm having testruns today
7Half of it some engineering programs.
12trying to get an early appointment is murder
best of luck then!
03Umbreon
03I have never needed to go to the DMV
03what do you need to go there for XD
if there's anything I can do to assist in the process, let me know
/me eats one anyway
12road test?
03o.o
03I took mine through the driving school
@clonemeter ValtheJean
12well you are lucky then
6 ValtheJean is 12% clone. (1531)
I love alien meat
Eating those burgers is about as safe as trusting Pinkemena.
12i get situations where i think i am lucky
thanks for the offer ValtheJean
Well, that's true...
12then something happens and it turns into an unlucky situation
any time
@clonemeter RobotPinkie

@trollmeter Dari
6 Dari is 54% troll. (1533)
7Well, does the linux system send the files to the computer or does it save it on the disk or something? :P
@trollmeter Princess Celestia
6 Princess Celestia is 25% troll. (1534)
sounds about right
12for example. first road test i schedule, turns out to be 3 days from the day i tried to schedule it. getting in that early i thought i was lucky as heck
>54%
>Ultimate troll
:P
12then i take the road test and fail it. and now i can't get another road test until late october
not to my knowledge
@psychoticmeter Pinkie Pie
6 Pinkie Pie is 44% psychotic. (1535)
03live boot means nothing on the computer is modified
12make matters worse, i now have no way to get to college
12which starts next week for me
03Linux is cool in that you can contain the entire operating system on a CD :P
@streammeter stream
6 stream is 89% stream. (1536)
7So... what happens from there? :P
Well,i DID rip Pinkemena to shreads earlier today.

03I thought he was fired
ew charlie sheen anything after hot shots
hey quan :3
I thought i was 90% crazy!
He was, but he's doing one last episode
So they say
7Problem I have at the moment is that my laptop borked so I can't go on it.
7And I'm limited in how much time I can use on this alternate computer.
7So we're holding off on the RP until later today.
03LOL, implying an RP is more important than fixing your computer
7Eh, it's not mine. :P
03well then again, my computers are so important they're top priority for me.
/me will be back in a bit
apparently you mellowed out some
Ok.

(If I may) passwords aren't completely useless
ohai hipster
/me feels the pony withdrawal beginning
Yeah, she summed it up right there
Do you have any experience moderating?
0>Three months in
Nope
I dunno, if they would just release a region free Blu Ray set, I wouldn't care what happens to the youtube vids
well I mean I care what happens to PMVs and such, but not full eps
fair enough
but if the vids disappear AND no Blu Rays
this will be me:

True, no more ponies for you until you can learn to handle your pony usage. :P

Mfw Dari's EQD script might be the one not troll thing he's ever done
0>check several times a day
wow
Hi IL
so I literally was *this* close to sounding like an idiot
I was about to do the "I DO COCAINE" line of Dr. Rockso
good day to you, how are things going?
12hi pancake
12i mean Pattyrick
12hi insane
7Hey, IL.
only replaced with ponies
and then I read it out loud
>mfw O_o
Go die, there is that good?
Hi Umbre
/me 0does ponies
Well apart from all the moderating I could contribute brainstorming and such
hello everybody! -hus-
>yfw other channels are being hit, too
VALTHEJEAN SMASH!
With future projects
0>yfw the piratebay
i wanted to ask if articuno used relay.
>yfw I already have all of Season 1 in HD on my computer
She sometimes comes onto the IRC
What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?\
so Hipster, we should totally get a bunch of people from ponychan or BMN and have a big Diablo II party some time
0>yfw I lost all of it when my computer crashed
Delicious HD ponies
has anybody seen Fluttershy lately? i havent seen her fro bout a day or so
Val YES OH MY GOD
:O
hope shes ok
0The first time I watched 1080 Ponies
0I was like
I'd be up for D2, though I haven't played in a long time
meh, tis better with groups
I haven't seen her, but she's probably fine
Well for one multiple chat rooms would be nice
rustiness gets swept away in the awesomeness :P
Or get that chat room cap fixed
prob lurking knowing her. she did say she lurked for a week before an appearances to get a good vibe of everyone.
Any other ideas?
mfw now I need to find my D2 cd
hopefully online still works in wine
if you register it on bnet, you never need the cds again
along wiht perhaps message throlling so the chat isnt as spammy
cool, I might do that
did it for D2,WC3 and Starcraft
works great, especially since my Brood War cd is cracked
I could also look into how I could stream aswell
Most def gonna do that
if needby
Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
suesan*
still need to buy WC3, damn
ahhh
twas a good game
back when Warcraft's story was good
you know...before Blizzard milked the hell out of it
SO I could contribute to the brony communinty and help bronystate because more awesome
become*
I haven't played the series much since the first one, lol
I know I have WC3 and Starcraft lying around here somewhere
ah
well, definitely has been improved :P
Do you have any previous IRC experience?
you know, not having to build roads and such :P
I mean I've tried WC2 and WC3, but I haven't played through them
Ahh, nostalgia
mmhmm
Not much but surely it cant be that hard
btw, Frozen Throne was a brilliant expo
seriously
GREAT addition to the Warcraft story/gameplay
I remember Ultima 4, that was a great game...
That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
such short answers it almost feels like i'm talking to a bot
Lawl
Which is?
I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
alright
First image:
and yeah if I buy WC3, I'm buying the full thing
cant see it

I see
as great as WC3 was, FT adds SO much to it
the Rexxar campaign was great
did you get my past PM dari?
ha ping out thats y it got quiet
/me 10wants to play SC2 now
though...now that I think about it
holy FUCK
REXXAR'S CAMPAIGN WAS A HINT TO WOW
JESUS
goddamn, why did they discontinue the WC3 battle chest?
Eeyup
and Rainbrodash, hit me up whenever I'm not at work
wb insano
because I love SC2
I would not do anything since theres not really anything wrong with it
I really want that, now :P
10valthejean what ladder do you play on, US?
they stopped the battlechest?
okay
thanks :)
Second image:
it's out of print, at least here
RBD...eh...I don't even remember. I played competitively for like, a week then ran out of time
or out of production
10valthejean we can't connect cross-versions if you live in the US..:< I'm EU/Russia
I played the fuck out of the BETA though
/me allows junh to recover and doesnt finish him as a act of murcy on behalf of him attacking me
10ha nice
yeah, but sometimes (like in SC1) I played on other servers
if posted during a movie that could warrent a warning
>yfw I tell you I played on Korean servers :P
10XD
Not really a huge deal otherwise
10mfw you had a 1-999999 win-loss ratio
though god...if I went back to SC1 now
lol, that would be it if I went back now
10:D
though I managed to hold my own
10I'm a mega casual at SC2
Third image:
10I can't be bothered to commit
sure, I never got into the competitive sphere like with HL2: DM
but I held my own :P

10haha, you got into HL2: DM?
10I never did
yeah, with SC2 I dunno why but I just kinda play it to enjoy it
oh yeah
I had my own team and everything
10lololol
god damn...and now the nostalgia bomb is hitting
Nothing wrong with it really
I miss skrimming with my mates...

10posting obligatory pony picture in t-3 seconds
I would def kick that person right then
yay thanks!
Lol sorry, I was checking Facebook and I got a lil' carried away
why can I never access your picture RBD?
in return, have this again: http://i956.photobucket.com/albums/ae45/Starscream101/131296662174.gif
and warn them to not post anything like that again
Alright, that was the last part of the interview.

fff
when stream's back up?
If the Moon is the Underworld, does that mean that Celestia is Charon?
Maybeh?
Dashite... what?
where's her rowboat though?
(Greek Mythology speech)
The rowboat is the Cannon.
ohai R2D2
aaaaah
10yo
and Space is the Styx...
Exactly.
10soo... who's hades?
Charon is the guy that takes you over the River Styx(presumably space, here), if you pay him anyway.
Luna?
No idea, but Luna is Jesus.
10luna's too cute to be hades :3
Luna would be Demeter?
Naw, the moon is the underworld of norse mythology
Luna is Balder
>mfw ^^
and Pinkie is Loki, obviously
10>okie dokie Loki

10it's a sign
