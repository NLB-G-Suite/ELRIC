AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
LE WONDARBOLT!

Again!!?
llllllllllllllllll
It doesn't help that some countries only have like...five voice actors total.
It's probably the reason why most Japanese don't care about the translation quality of English dubs.
lost count of all these cons
...and then they try to use said dubs in order to learn English.
And that was the day spike learned to fly
mica do you like fps games from the 90's?
Translating into Japanese is really tricky since a literal translation is all but impossible.
00,10meh

And that is -hard-
it seems THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME
I'm... ok with this
Fluttershy's still Dawwable. :3

Pony names are already weird in that way, in that they're also words.

Pinkie gasp is best
Speaking of which, I think it's AMAZING that all the main crew have names that don't make me cringe.
