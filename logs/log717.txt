It would be an awesome sight that at the moment of dawn on November 1st, all the spookiness, the creepyness, the scariness, and everything negative about Halloween gets violently wiped away, and all that's left... are the nicer costumes and the candy.

The problem with translations of MLP is that it is adequate for kids, but the undertone meant for adult doesn't get through often. At least that's the case in Dutch

Well, 2 at least tries.
Vladimir Putin...

Dark_Horst, that would be an act of mercy

why you has bestmusic for level one
they all sound so under motivated all the background singers XDD
her voice sings, but her eyes plead for redemption
oh come on... i know that theyre language probably doesnt fit aswell to the beat but COME ON! ATLEAST TRY!
That dub needs to be condemned
woo over
phew
noooooooo
BILLY MAYS HERE
what have they done...
considering this was suposed to be bad, shouldn't this be a win
This song is supposed to be horrible... so good job I guess
wtf?
only god can help you all now
00,10not that bad
what....
how you doin MadSurge
what didi wake up to ffffffs
YARRR! By Celestia's beard!
She sounds like an east german olympian

AAAAAHHHH!!!!
the buck is this
Poor AJ
NO!!!!
this is apprejack. applejacks cousin twice removed. they dont talk about her
maybe it runs in the family...?
They went in dry
actually #15 seems about right
Well... it's an interesting choice. Could probably get used to it after a while
wut...
no...
00,10not bad number 10
Oh
damn
Adam isn't on
I'm about 2 segments behind I think
i wish they would have made this song batucada, JUST forthe Brazilians.
MadSurge: about the same for me XD I've got a parent free day an' I aint gonnah waste it!
well yeah, it aint too bad
10 is fine so far
well, at least they can sing
unlike other dubs we heared
00,10dat rarityrage
9 seems ok, too.
00,10nope
00,10nope nope nope
...for some reason i expected a gruff manly voice
not to bad... i guess...
i'm probably lsitening to norwegian metal too much
8 is ok, too. The voice is strange, but at least it can hold a tone
NO EXPLANATION
wtf
YOOHOOHOO

Oh great now my computers frozen the stream for me again -_-
so appearantly they call screws bolts
00,10pinkiebot
I understand where they made the error in translation, but that's hilarious. XD
is that an electronic voice?
dat autotune
this ones ok
Autotune~
HEAVY on the autotune
At least they tried to keep her on pitch. XD
Probably they didn't have any choice
sounds entirely artificial, so much autotune is in there
Eeeew, Autotune
I'd rather have autotune than painfully off pitch singing
...why did they do that?
Phase4
why do they speak different laguages?
If the VA can't sing just hire someone else to do that!
Dark_Horst: She was probably painfully off pitch.
JRP2234
Dark_Horst, probably they recorded the voices seperately and mixed the wrong ones together
o.o
You have to understand that the other languages have much less money to play with
2 B CONTINUOO
What if you can't afford to hire a singer?
Phase4! i meant to ask, do you still play on magicka?
Dat manly voice
xD
:D
Gold_Demona, don't accept a contract to dub a show with lots of singing in it.
some of them spund like the daily wage was a coke and half a banana
I thought portugese RD was male?
Flyboy, not often but yeah
Phase4: becuase i just got it :)
Hey, Bronystate!
Phase4 http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/11/pony-party-at-hoyts-cinema.html
Phase4: you wanna play a bit at some point?
oh lord xD
00,10I like her laugh
ikila
Flyboy, maybe
Oh god...
Nightmare Moon laughs like Mandark
Oh really? THE DRAGON VOICE? You're really looking for anything there :|
oh noes
I don't mind Finnish Nightmare
But hey, Russian dub is even worse
'her laugh sounds like Mandarks but not rhythmed like his
xD
dat hoyts
couldnt be bothered to dub XD
wow great singer
i didnt know i could understand turkish until today
Gold_Demona: our dub is too good, they're latching on secondary character voices :D
Dark_Horst: Same
Flyboy, better give up than do a shoddy job
its like they got the origanal voice
MadSurge: lol :D
swedish
xD
point taken
JRP2234, i've got an exam that day so...
oh god
that
I have no rectum mark!

What's the problem with 6?
apple foot
T.T
7 I mean
Serenity neither do i :(
JRP2234, also its only happening in western australia acording to the hoyts website :'(
Hey hey, Italy has Beauty Marks too. But no word on that?!
mica <<< it reminds me of roman saying Nikko
schönheitsfleck >literal translation > beauty mark
LOL I understand the error in translation with the "apple foot"
Phase4 10th 16th
The spanish word for foot is spelled PIE
Dark_Horst, what would be the right translation for cutie mark?
we dont have a specific word for "cutiemark"
Phase4 10th - 16th*
rofl
MY EARS
JRP2234, still in western australia
RainbowAsh: there's none
LOL Apple PIE!

o.o
dem voices
dem manly wemon there
dose children
RainbowAsh: Мило-метки X)
did i hear fru gala
Dark_Horst, is it really a fail then? They had to come up with something that fit the length
Many crossdressers it seems
Female crossdressers

Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 9 days, 2 hours, 13 minutes, 57 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)

Or very very physically mature children
00,10all bit cut from the turkish version
haah Phase4, how you like me now.
JunkerKun, I am afraid I don't speak that language
WA woop.

mutterguy_, new zeland? probably not, don't have lots of money
RainbowAsh: sure they had. one an argue about the tehcnicality of fail. sounds bad either way
Jmo, :<
mica gotta love the buffer
Like a 2 hour drive there. :3
Rarity put on weight. Rofl
RainbowAsh: =) There is no proper translation. What I wrote is cutie mark in Russian.
We can't have a WOMAN loving a MAN!
Phase4 iunno they can be quite cheap.
...why banned?
Dark_Horst: love XD
MadSurge, actually it's a child from another species loving a woman, but yeah.
Dark_Horst: probably
Wat? No horrible Russian dub?
Boo
00,10love and or viloence
It's baconmane and his brother, manebacon!
MadSurge: I agree COMPLETELY
wow. turks ban love in telelvision?
mutterguy_, i've got other things to worry about first, after my exams i'll look into it
i didint know that
The french dub is just epic

Gold_Demona: Totally agree
I don't even know any French, but I wanna watch it anyway
yeah. listened to german dub. wasnt quite as hottibleas it could be.... still bad
couldnt listen to it
HavokOC|AFK: I'm telling you, try to watch it in Russian
and then there was the cutie mark problem
I like the Italian dub, but I fear hearing the songs :|

MadSurge: I haven't studied any French. Any French I pick up is anything that's similar to Spanish. :P
00,10love that trick with the hourglass
nmm
00,10I totaly missed it the first time
wait, missed it T.T
MadSurge: WHich isn't nearly as much as there is in Italian
Sumica: same here
Are the opening sequences dubbed as well?
Twilight's home in Canterlot is pretty awesome
Now I only wish I could understand what they're saying...
FUS ROH DAH?
Gold_Demona: true, french is complicated even for other neolatin speakers
that sound effect!
JunkerKun, you don't know the episodes by heart?
i'm pretty sure thats not her home7
just the library
RainbowAsh: I didn't watch first two episodes too much actually
00,10yes Kaidrin
did i hear monsieur twillight?
T.T
HavokOC: ikr
HavokOC: MA CHERE Twilight
"Make some friends!"
i like french version a lot
Dark_Horst, it doesn't look large enough to be the city library and we know that the royal library is not in a tower
00,10here comes fancy pinkie
berry
oh god
poneh!
could be either pivate library
or cintinuity error
Sumi is Mod

mica nice lip sync
Wow, that Pinkie scream
Oh, figures.
Is the image a little stretched?
sumi dance
Nyst: a little?!
Nyst, that's how they broadcast in france
poor france.
dat laugh
*giggle
But, Pinkie isn't suppsed to scream, she should gasp.
i may have done french, but i cant understand a word of this..
What happens when the "my sister's speakin' fancy!" part comes up?
Le diner est prêt
macintosh
i only know what theyre saying becuase of so many replays of season 1
I deffinately heard macintosh
its a name
Kaidrin, mah sister's speakin'.... country?
00,10or madam le flour
Kaidrin, maybe she will switch dialects?
I understand it fine and I haven't spoken french in years.
XD

roseluck is a pretty pone http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1351741518841.gif
names nouens* stay the same in other languages
It helps that I know the dialogue by heart.
Sumica: you MUST find us 'party of one' YOU MUST
Yes!
why
I wonder how many of the foreign voice actors knew what they were getting into.
Me-Gusta? O_O
dat voice
Nyst: I don't but I can still understand it fine if spoken at this speed.
I like French RD
They probably thought it was just another kiddie toon.
why
the SFX are so f*cking loud!
Italian RD is Dexter btw :D
Nyst: they probably got into nothing since the only ones we give a shit abput are the original ones :D
MadSurge: LOL That's awesome. :D
they sound like pedo
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
LE WONDARBOLT!
LE WANNDERBALLT
Dark_Horst: is that why you think some of the translations are so awful?
Discord!?
Dark_Horst, didn't some of the European cons invite some of the dub speakers? I think that sexy sounding spitfire va in particular
Again!!?
llllllllllllllllll
Nyst: naw. i think they're so bad bacause budget. or the translating companies didnt give a shit. mostly both
Gold_Demona: also Fluttershy and Applejack have the same VA and they sound nothing alike :D
MadSurge: Awesome :D
RainbowAsh: actually, i have no idea
It doesn't help that some countries only have like...five voice actors total.
I wonder what Turkey made out of that?
Or does turkish spike like big buts?
It's probably the reason why most Japanese don't care about the translation quality of English dubs.
lost count of all these cons
...and then they try to use said dubs in order to learn English.
I know over here, literally every cartoon is voiced by the same small group of people.
Dark_Horst: Nah, they just what we call "Надмозг", literally meaning "Overmind" which is a meme. It means very VERY bad translation often using automated translation programms
And that was the day spike learned to fly
mica do you like fps games from the 90's?
with his invisible dragon wings
Translating into Japanese is really tricky since a literal translation is all but impossible.
00,10meh
perfect timing
Fancy Rarity is still fabulous
Nyst: Literal translation if often worse than adaptation, no?
*is
You need to keep the original intent and tone of the script, translated into a regional and/or social equivalent
And that is -hard-
it seems THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME
I'm... ok with this
Fluttershy's still Dawwable. :3
JunkerKun: Literal translation is often just funny.
:D
^w^
dat hair cam
-_-
Nyst: Yep. We have "Twilight Sparkle" and "Полуночная Искорка". And at the same time we have "Rainbow Dash" and "Радужная Дэш" with "Дэш" being transliteration. I mean, WTF?
did spike just say "Oh F***
Nyst, don't forget it also needs to be about the same length and it looks strange when you can't match the sentence structure it looks strange when the expressions change at the wrong point.
I don't read russian; can you give a literal translation of those words?
And now Fluttershy knows the rest of the backstory.
SURPRISE
Yeah Twilight! Tell him.
ohgodfrenchpinkie
^
00,10it works
Nyst: "Полуночная Искорка" is literal translation of "Twilight Sparkle" and "Радужная Дэш" is a bullshit. Because "Радужная" is literal translation and "Дэш" is just "Dash" spoken in Russian
Nyst: actually, you dont read cyrillic
RainbowAsh: they had to resort to call Celestia with her full english title in italian because of lip sync
Sumi, the gif. do you make it dance manually or is it just part of the gif?
It's like a stereotypical mexican sports announcer pinkie!
Oh, so it's like how it'd be 'ranbowu daishu' in Japanese?
00,10it's part of the animations
HavokOC: it's Desktop Ponies!
Nyst: Kind of
Oh, okay
That's kinda funny.
Desktop Ponies?
00,10has 4 animations that it picks from at random
Then it's just timing when it dances when music is on lol
Nenenenenenene
00,10google it Kaidrin
Good point.
Nyst: Especially when all other names are literal translations...
Nyst: I still wait for second season dub to hear what else they can come up with
transliterations
Huzzah, luna
MadSurge, Equestria is best British Empire
Junkerkun; what would you have done? Kept all the names in english?
RainbowAsh: :D
Nyst: of course. they're names
names need no translation
I love what they did with the Major's voice
That's a good point.
Nyst: italian did that :D
has anyone seen my gloves?
germy too
*germany
Nyst: Either make adaptation or keep english names. Mixing both is just no good
Pony names are already weird in that way, in that they're also words.
LEGASP
wow. my typing sucks today
I love those things XD
Dark_Horst, I think I will call it germy from now on. ;)#
Pinkie gasp is best
/me pokes Gold_Demona
Speaking of which, I think it's AMAZING that all the main crew have names that don't make me cringe.
great. now i've done it
00,10ok i like that NMM
Kurra nope /me hides gloves
00,10sounds sexy
MadSurge: Italian had another opening =)
Gosh French Pinkie sonds so excellent, like she's just waiting to share a champagne with you and then classy rave till midnight and then share another champagne with you till 3 am
what wumic asaid
wow
They could have been called Sunshine Rainbow and Lollipop Hugs.
how did i do that?
JunkerKun: avoid the second season opener, it suuuuuucks :D
MadSurge: D=
Does my crown no longer count? Maybe it would if you had one
POR TU JOUR
i vote for ep1 in every language
I wonder if Bon-Bon's voice stays the same throughout in differevt languages?
pour toujours
HavokOC: i dont think you know what you're getting into
00,10ok lets find some party of one
yes
JunkerKun: but Discord, Chrysalis and Luna got great voices :$
Dark_Horst: Thing is, i've done it once already
Sumica, what? No, I need closure
One thing I don't know is, do the french not have a word for pony?
:D
HavokOC: you.... are not human
What about :P
Dark_Horst: Ofc not. I'ma pony
>:>
*>.>
HavokOC: You are ROBOT PONY!
actually
I'm gummy
Rainbow's voice works really really well here.

i think that was a really unfriendly thing to do that moment, and it's only made more horrible by the dogsqualing foley sound as Pinkie's head gets JAMMED in the door ;;
No problemo Roberto?

Dark_Horst, I think they might
I only hope they used actual regional accents for the voices.
Oh you Pinkie
That would be amazing.
Oui zat is correct madame
Dark_Horst, ok, maybe not
O U Dabi.
Tiji?

I really like RD's voice.

Madame laferine?
Nyst, the voice acting is also really good
JunkerKun: Lafarine
Rock sounds like the Sims

Simlish I think it's called
MadSurge: Does that means something or is it just a name?
Bonjour Chaqueponey

Jawohl mein herr!

Polish is still ok, isn't it?
what's the difference between Ich bin Trixie, and Ich heiBe Trixie?
I keep forgetting tosay Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit when I wake up on the first day of the month
What about... Equestrian?
RainbowAsh: And sounds horribly like Russian. At least few parts
00,10cam rip, some how looks better then last direct rip
Kaidrin: it's all neighs and whinnies
rofl
Kurra: the first means "I am", the second "My name is"
Sumica: Ikr

This is one good camcorder

heißen means "being called"

Kaidrin: Wuuut
00,10yay?
Sumica: better luck for the villains in italian :D
It's strange that english don't have that word. Since alot of proto-germanic languages have it
Dark_Horst: there is no english word with all these implications
DaringDerpy: we like being special^^
http://challengersassemble.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2_tse.jpg?w=361

Sumica, swedish songs?

Whew, so many trixies
and I'm like UUUGH CAN'T TAKE IT @_@
:)
nick jr showed this?
Aaaaand geman!
we gonna have a whole ep?
i thought that was gonnah be the mlp glitch remix for a second :(
*r
I never watched a german episode before
it's like watching dubbed animé
We should see German Discord. See how that sounds :)
00,10did it just say pony rich?"
i dont think so
maybe i just wasnt listening
could very well be
Sumica, the german dub is about a fiscal crisis now
hm.... not so good job on the intro
Oh god, that theme o_e
00,10wannna come?
better than the french one imo
Did they just sing "arish ponies"?
no
mica i want your boy babys
Kommst du mit? Coming you with? lawl he
Whats the name of that pony?
00,10shnel
THe one that talked
SCHNELL
*Schnell
RainbowAsh: there is no fiscal crisis in germany. at the moment the last tax estimate is all over the media. again better than expected. the greek and the ones with the fiscal crisis
TO ZE POINT DUMKOPF
-and +are
"horse in the moon"
fuck
Das Pferd im Mond?
ohai btw
sup
was bed...bideu... bedeutet?
stute im mond klingt auch nicht besser
'what does that mean'
true
didnt know you were german :D
^^
fomnutn
vonnöten
AUSGEZEICHNET
spike sounds too old
DaringDerpy, oh politics. Basically the strength of the Euro is great for Germany as an export oriented country and very bad for counries dependent on imports, like Greece. But the more the weak Euro countries collapse, the closer the crisis will draw to Germany as well, unless they disolve the currency union before that point. But in any case, there are soon going to be a lot of poor and desperate neighbors who have a lot of reason to be very mad at Ge
rmany.
not Germany
EU
00,10dat too big to desplay message
people will be mad at EU and EØS
ugh, politics
/me gets mat at germanium, stupid element, Ge
Like use the weapons sold by the Germans to them to pay Berlin a visit mad
RainbowAsh: actually, a weak currency is better for export. raises the local purchasing power of the exporter
also that last line, fuck you RainbowAsh
O_O;;
RainbowAsh: that on the other hand would make the rest of europe very mad
nangerdauert
RainbowAsh: eurp problems or not, germany is the economic center of europe. trying to start a war would affect the whole continent
Süppchen?
there is not even one soup
there will be no war
all dem abble
00,10not bad english
of course not
besides, the temperature in Europe don't seem to be "I'm mad at Germany"
governments arent that stupid
stupid yes, THAT stupid? now
*no
^^
The Germans are good at making things. Like English in German.
and isn't EU hq in France?
the communists are mad at germany...but they are always mad. at everyone and everything
Hehe
the communists must be mad because their heyday ended in 1989 :D
DaringDerpy, actually you are right. Still, weak countries would like to devaluate their currency in order to reduce their debt problems, but they can't because of the shared currency.
rainbow dash sounds strange
Oh gosh
main problem with the dub. the voices dont really suit the characters
oh gosh
00,10wonderbalds
but it could've been worse
insipration strikes @_X
the wonderbalds are very very bald
I thought Norwegian dub was weird, Spike sounded like an old woman
DaringDerpy, we have all been growing up during probably the single longest peaceful period in the history of Europe. That doesn't mean this age will last until the end of time.
We have? What about all the wars in the 90s?
you kinda noticed ehr reading lines there
Good afternoon everyone! :)
00,10bibelotec?
Bibliothek
biblotek
ekips wins the cookie
RainbowAsh: yes. these countries have no developed fiscal system. everyone evaded taxes, and the government paid its bills with the money printing press...so in the end, through the inflation, everyone paid anyway. doesn't work anymore if the central bank follows a stability strategy. they knew it when they joined. they faked their statistics to be able to join. now the fraud backfired
00,10bleh, so tired
Vivix, the only european war I can remember in the 90s was in serbia. But other than that, I don't think there was that much armed strife.
Georgia, Serbia and Bosnia was same I think- Libanon I guess was outside, but was tons of european soldiers
and I guess many here are old enough to remember the DDR
fluttershy :)
meh
*squeak*
Because of allies, I don't think we've got any european war close in sights
Vivix, yeah, in the last 20 years Europe has exported a lot of warfare, but there was little conflict at home. There was never an armed conflict with east germany I think.
there wasnt
No, true, but I remember european wars, nothing as fierce as the years before us
except
...how did that word get into here?
Jugoslavia?
actually planned to wripe that into skype
*write
Well I know a lot of post sovjet armed conflicts
but I don't know their names
00,10gonna end it here after pinkie
But we still have NATO and Warzaw pact, it's just silly to say someone will attack Germany because of EU
and EU != Germany
there she is
Vivix, the Warzaw pact is still in effect?
I had a really really horrible nightmare last night, and I can't tell if the threat of war was real, or if it was dreamed :(
I think parts of it is
Sumica: work? Or bed?
cuba? no. venezuela might start a conflict. but the chance is low. and argentine might start something about the falklands again.
Wiki it, I'm reading
00,10sleep
00,10much sleep
Sumica: ahhh, then good night :)

thanks RainbowAsh... just... bad bad dreams last night
sometimes can't remember if my memories were made in dreams or in real life, and that's a freaky enough sensation in itself.
playing ageist 21 bots with the highest difficult setting on is not fun in doom 2.
Kurra, I totally know that feeling. It can be quite disconcerting
and so, the chatroom became undead

there's an xcom review on zeropunctuation
MadSurge, Artillery ftw
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6468-XCOM-Enemy-Unknown
I can't believe http://www.fimfiction.net/story/51319/An-Old-Mare%27s-Tale has so few views. It's awesome.
DaringDerpy: and? Does he bash it for flimsy reasons?
still watching it
Morning.
metroid prime is best topic
:P
DaringDerpy: love zero punctuation :P He reminds me of Charlie Brooker for some reason
don't know the man
I havent seen his fictionalk productions so I wouldent know MadSurge :P
Try looking at Dead Set and Black Mirror
I would never have guessed after seeing alot of his games reviews MadSurge :$

Snow: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKrUug8lHjA

Jake : That would be disturbing but...interesting at the same time.

Snow: characters which are typically from role playing games play a role playing game with everyday human characters
oh
XD
Snow: role reversal
neat
Ohhhh I see! :D
Jake: im making an anthro version of my OC as we speak.

Being proud of that I'm off to dinner! Hm...I wonder whats for it...Anyways be right back!
4:00 in the afternoon here
18:47 here
N4X when I first joined the chat, I didn't think that I'd stay for a long time and chose an easy nickname
ekips: sometimes simple is the best ;)
muhaha
i like simple names
because im not really goo d at remembering names
4 letters cout as simple right?
*count
Hiya
hai RainbowAsh
Hallo RainbowAsh
yes Jake, four letters scout as simple
Hi Invi and Jake
wohoo
Hai RainbowAsh
Hi Brovakiin
did you see the new bronies react btw?
ok, so the S3 starts 15:00 UTC, germany is UTC+1, that means it starts 16:00 here right?
hey RainbowAsh :)
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 8 days, 21 hours, 9 minutes, 33 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Hi Lil_B
Snow: I saw the video, but I refused to watch it :P
is germany really UTC *1?
yes it seems
Invi yep,
Hey, will the brony ad also be broadcasted then?
oh okay i see
we are east from london so yes
brb
so, 16:00 is correct for us tight? (I'm bad with Timezones )
Lil_B, yes, that sounds correct
right*
Lil_B: yes
nice :)
why do teeth suck so BAD, i just got a random toothache for no reason
wasn't it 20:00 for s2?
Jake: things change
yup
well
and i say DEAL WITH IT
because I'm moving to a new House on exactly that day and I was worried that I may miss it because of work, but My family should be ok with 16:00
It's the old hour
at least its on ytube at 20:00 then
Aeiou
I really wanna watch it here on Bronystate :3
nah. on 16:30 :D
The premier is going to be a full hour of ponies, right?
sure
pfff, why watch it on yt when you can watch it here?
hey it has 2 parts so double play and proccessing time
There will be less lag on youtube
<--- watched season 1 and 2 in 2 days straight
ditto ^^
>_> <_<
(based on canterlot wedding 2 hours should be correct
Tervicz, youtube won't be chuck full of chatty goodness.
even if my room is empty except for my PC, and even if I unplug my PC the second it's over to drag it up there, I'm watching it here!
i was stressed ok? i had my exams after the weekend!
Wont they show the two parter on two separate weeks?
ohey Alchemist
because some people cant take the suspence
hi Lil_B !
maybe
No, episode 3 is on the 17th
it wil litterally kill them.
o_O..
someone go over to wiki and look it up
Thats great
Snow: Wow... I needed four days for season one up to episode 19 the first time around
RainbowAsh: exam stress is a great motivator
damn, someone made a Portal Album just with steady Calming Noises and Sounds, each song is longer than 15min, but I love it, so relaxing
Alchemist, I distinctively remember reading somewhere officialish that they would show both parts on the same day
sometimes I think I still haven't wacthed all the episodes
Lil_B: do you mean "songs to test by"?
Snow, yeah, I know, there is no limit on what you can achieve when you are supposed to do something else
RainbowAsh: I cant remember if they showed the S2 premier at the same time or 1 week apart...
Alchemist, a week apart.
Jake no, that's the official Album (btw a Actual Physical Edition of that camde out recently!)
neato
I think I go to bed so i can watch the movies later. c y'all at about 0:00h ^^
Jake 4 Discs, the 4th one has Portal 1 Songs
RainbowAsh: i watched it because there wasnt anything else that could keep my mind off my exams(dont know how its called in english but i have failure fear) and a guy at my schooo watched so i gave it a try.
oh wait it's thursday
Invi Movies?
Invi: Movies? Tonight?
school*
Jake the Album I ment is called "Dream with Portals" you can get it for free on Bandicamp
okay, cancel dat ^^
Snow: I completely understand. And, did ponies help you with your exam?
sleep cancelled for Invi
RainbowAsh: i passed with a 5.6, just enough to pass
Lil_B, *early sleep ^^
.-.
I thought it was friday too, and not just one time today... My brain is derp.
/me flips Jmo around
stop lying on your back
Snow: Still, you passed, that does account for something, doesn't it?
:<
/me huggles Snow
this day felt like 2 days ^^
my sis once dreamed she was so bad they had to make a new mark for her
that is actually cool
Jake: ditto here
then she passed with 1.4
i even dreamed i had to live in a box

Computer is on and I'm sleeping away valuable Time >.<

Lil_B, c'mon sleep is important ^^
or caffeine. choose one ^^
Snow: Before my last exam, I imagined what each of the mane 6 would say about the worries I had. Like Twilight saying how she failed at Lesson Zero and it turned out to be ok in the end. That worked surprisingly well.
who needs sleep when you have bronystate?
Invi I know, but I wanna sleep at night and not during the day when I can dfo Stuff ^^
Lil_B, you can do stuff at night, too
I should actually start finally doing stuff :D
Lil_B: be happy, i fall asleep whenever my body wants it.
Snow: Narcolepsy?
RainbowAsh not when you have people in the house that are complaining otherwise, and who WILL turn off the power... like my Mom
Lil_B, ah, that sucks.

AJIsAwesome: :O she's beautiful!
whats going on between MadSurge and AJIsAwesome ? xD

*fav
since when does pink have a taste?
N4X :D
Snow: since bubblegum
N4X, that is one of the scariest things about growing up: The realiziation that you can just buy yourself a cake and eat it and no one can stop you
Jake: bubblegum taste like bubbles
MadSurge: Oh hell I've never really thought about that one...
/me hugs Snow back while nomming on waffles and playing with Pinkie Pie :3
Snow: Since blue became the new red
11,02Just saw the Wii U commercial...it pretty cool :3c
RainbowAsh: That just changed my whole idea of growing up! D:
RainbowAsh: And that you can buy yourself neat stuff and no one can do anything about it!
RainbowAsh: oh god you dont mean tf2 team balancer i hope?
just dont grow up
RainbowAsh: that's not scary, it's awesome! Just make sure you don't eat it all at once and don't become a fat fuck :D
get older bt dont grow up
hmmm errrr ummm
Today is national cheap unsold candy day

Snow: Actually I thought about that one scene in Wall-E, but I guess that works too
i'm back, did i miss anything ^_^
It's the day you go buy bags of unsold Halloween candy for like, $.50 each
BladedWings : Hello Kitty cake
N4X: oh my what!? :O
Stallion_of_War: rly?
Stallion_of_War: Wheee candy discount!
stupid chat room lagged no i have to have a different name
BladedWings : You see, a friend of mine once bought such an ice cake and said that it tasted like...pink
i got a tooch ache but thank god for hydros
That was the answer to the question how Pinkie pies would taste...
N4X: oh cool
AJIsAwesome: saved :3
N4X: Sensory blending is a thing; some people really can taste colors because signals get crossed in the brain, or something.
I think
or see sound or somethng
how do applejacks taste?
Stallion_of_War : That sounds...like an interesting experience.
N4X: http://www.livescience.com/169-rare-real-people-feel-taste-hear-color.html
you actually think of a different taste if yout food has a different color or texture
Welcome back, BladedWings. :)
Why do I know about people who can taste colors????
What type of random knowledge is that?
try drinking blue tomato juice and you'll see
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go get some delicious purple flavored ice cream
hmmm purple
Stallion_of_War : Did you know: Dolphins plunge small sponges over their snouts when they search for food on the bottom of the ocean.
Why am I suddenly listening to nyan cat dubstep remix? Oh youtube
Good evening everybrony.

Vivix you don't even like ponies.
Are these rumors? Or is it for real? :S
!
It's for real VenHur, relatively old news, but you can probably find them pretty fast on google
Don't have a least, but my favorite is Applejack. Applejack wins by default. :3
VenHur: rumors of? star wars being bought by Disney?
That is also true ~~
money in the baaag
No, that's already known news. I mean an official MLP FiM video game.
by Gameloft?
11,02Shizuka: O U
When I thinks of an MLP video game, I thinks of the variety and crazy levels designs of the Spongebob games..
Well, it's simpler than that I'm sure
but it does look fun
Think of Light, Camera Pants, but with Ponies...
http://toucharcade.com/2012/10/15/build-your-dream-ponyville-in-gamelofts-my-little-pony/ here Venhur
Is that some sort of spy gadget? Camera Pants?

...And the CD-ROMs of Employee of the Month and Lights, Camera, Pants...
I am Confused, and I am barb.
Oh no that ... can only imply more

That was yesterday. Sh.
BLOOD.
That never happened.
All over Barb.
Doolb.

13i'm confused
heeeyaaayaaayyaaaa
13what controversy
ok...um, whats going on here?
13they're vegetables
Whats going on here?
Controversy? Where?
I can clear this right up. YEs. I am the sexiest here.
Shizuka: No, no, it's because of the message of "God loves you all" in the show, Trust me, I researched.
I have ALL the creditials
13it's controversial?
...i agree with Barb
Barb|Meh heyyayaaayaaaaaaya no
13well that's NBC
The More You Know!
13you don't watch veggie tales on local channels, you watch it on VHS like a real filly
I need a cigar
I need therapy...
Kicking habits are a pain.
SolarWing: Sounds liek a personal problem
shoke an a pancake?
Hah haha.
Hah..
*smoke
veggie tales is controvisual?
/me pulls back the hammer on his gun
Say it again.
I need food.
13the only controversy i ever knew of with veggie tales was they edited the bunny song
pipe an a crepe?
What happened with the Bunny Song?
lmao
And that is enough rp out of me
austen powers?
Si.
I didn't really watch Veggie Tales as a kid. I only had one or two books about it. :D
hey guys, I just got my fifth gym badge in Pokemon black 2
cigar an a waffle?
13VenHur: NBC edited it out because they're gigantic wimps
Shizuka: Agreed.
13considering it's largely based around retelling stories from the bible
...Heh...
...I'm kind of a Ned from The Simpsons if you ask me...heh...
!! I forgot about this movie http://i.imgur.com/A4uvD.jpg
Aw. It so should of been streamed yesterday
13i think at best you'd have... both the are you my neighbor sets.. and... just maybe larry's lagoon
13everything else was retelling a story
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Brony Thank You Fund Ad Schedule
i have a question, what is Cadance's cutiemark?
no there was larry tales about larry being a super hero
13yeah larry boy i guess
13that's a spinoff though
SolarWing: A couple of hearts, I think.
no no no, its a blue gem in the shape of a heart but what dose it represent :/
13blue gems shaped like hearts
13that's her talent, she's a gemcutter
...nah
It represents her ability to fix lovers' relationships, I think.
then why a blue crystal heart?
Why not?
Blue gem shaped like a heart with golden thingies at its side that kinda look like sea ponies
do we have a stream
I will try to fix you
Nope.
hum...the gem kind of looks like a fire ruby but...blue :/
Why does Pinkie Pie have a pink balloon amongst 2 yellow balloons? Because that's the way she was designed.
SolarWing, for the same reason cherilee's cutie mark are three flowers.
oh and btw pinkies is a yellow among two blue :P
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Hot Topic Pony Promotion
HA
AHAHA
Alright, so what do we say we start VeggieState with the first story from 1993?
SolarWing, an ice sapphire then maybe
Start what?
13and now, TALES FROM THE CRISPER
SolarWing: Sorry. :P
13FRRANKENCELERY!
=o
I am scured

Game audio is a tad loud compared with your voice
but that all changed when the firenation attacked
sound drawns your voice NewDCD
NewDCD: When you have an appropiate time, I'd like to talk to you.
this looks like Eragon...
Shizuka: why do I think batshit insane Asuka is cute too o__o
I mean, the story
13http://i.imgur.com/YgQT0.jpg not sure
OohShiny: spoilers, in most Fire Emblem games there are no monsters

No- Game over.
Culd you turn down the volume, NewDCD.
So, who's streaming as of now?
OohShiny: also, death of your units is permanent
VenHur: DCD is.
Rule from RPGs: When you start, you always wake up

DED
NewDCD: Oh, DCD, WHY YOU SO RANDOM, BRO?
Wow, Then this game is annoying
lol
Lol
Restart. :3
that's when games use to be hard
^
^^
wrong!
But by restarting you don't have to face squad
2003 was not
games were hard in the 90s
^
OohShiny: But that is what made them so much fun.
OohShiny then beat fire emblem perfectly without losing a single char
Spoilers: she's the protagonist
go ahead i dare you
I hope you're a taco loving guy DCD, cause I am too, bro!
"What an odd-sounding name" :D
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: try beating Ninja Gaiden without losing lives, then you have my respect

OohShiny which ninja gaiden cause i already more than one

What console is this? GBA?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the NES ones
beat*
"I think I can handle them all on my own" ... Sure, you think that.
yep
OohShiny well you go first then you can dare me to it
NewDCD: If you beat Contra without the Konami Code, not losing ANY lives AND not taking ANY damage...We'll worship you...AS GOD!
VenHur: Asians
^
VenHur, ah, contra, that game was awesome.
NewDCD went to the bathroom or somethin?
RainbowAsh: FUCK YEAH! TOMATO GUN!
Think he's taking care of something.
So who's streaming?
NewDCD
NewDCD: .
Ahh
Inb4 NintendoCapriSun
Y' know, IN THE BATHROOM~
so, is my nickname rememberable?
Eeyup.
OohShiny, yeah
sitting onb tha toilet~
let's see then, when was the last time I was here?
just kidding
We can't hear you that well, NewDCD.
NewDCD: cant hear you too well, game audio is loud
Better

OohShiny: indeed, you can get different endings

She's totally going to backstab him, isn't she?
So. Who is playing Fire Emblem?

Shizuka have you seen that pretty much the entirity of all the tekkit mods are 1.4.2

where's the name Duwang from, anyway?
13redpower?

NewDCD: Ever heard of 'nother RPG for the good 'ol SNES called "Illusion of Gala"?

*Gaia, VenHur :D
so it wont be in tekkit
ANyone hear that crunching sound?
thats the rumours anyway
13well they're all moving over to feed the beast

optifine never really did anything for me
but yeah, the lack of reis is annoying
http://imgur.com/YqrjT
but they never got a response of the guy, so they didnt put it
As in FIRE Emblem.
13optifine lets me kill distance fog and use high res textures
PASSION AND FIYAAAH
I thought Green Biker Dude was the greatest character ever.

Anyway, I've decided to do something I haven't done for months.

NewDCD is best VA...
photosythesis should be more effective. then we wouldnt need that eating bullshit
"You there, command us!" That's a weird line.
Who's duwang anyway
he never appears
"You there, command us! FOR CHEESE!"
OohShiny: DCD, in other words, the player.
OohShiny, Duwang lives in us all
VenHur: :D
...I just made that line 20% weirder.
duwang sounds like a name someone came up woth for his dick
...Ewww...
Dark_Horst: Why would you say that?
Sounds more like someone's D&D character to me.
OohShiny: why wouldn't i?^^
we need more Fighter

he would totally make that guy buy a sword

Polydunami: so Sain is supposedly a Pedophile in the Japanese version?
this remembers advance wars to me :p
Ephebophile*

Hi Robotdragon9 :)
Hai Robotdragon9 :)
heya Robotdragon9!
Hey therem Robotdragon9
Hi Robotdragon9
*there
Hi Robotdragon9!
only thing missing in this game is a tiger tank
dats a lotta pings XD
And fishes.
yeah..
flying fish
I love it when you have to back track to some spot earlier in a game and just smoke the now weak enemies :).
Your probably getting more sleep than me these days
and they#re ridden by sharks
with laserguns
Hi, Robotdragon9. :)
ey
Robotdragon9: Here, have another one! XD
:( I actually do usually get decent sleep
Everlasting_Joy: thats where TES:Oblivion failed hard.
GilDash gaaah the pings
Woo hoo! Level up, muddafuckah!
Alchemist: How so?
skyrim did a little better there
Robotdragon9: Aww, they love you really.
*yay*
when I seen Robotdragon9's name, I thought of the Robot Cat song :)
Robotdragon9: all the pings :D
they had both, enemies levelling with you, and the ones that were stuck on theirs
7Yeah I just needed something to get your attention and lead in with.
GilDash! :$
Dark_Horst: It was more complicated then that.
MadSurge: Holla! :)
lol, whatever works I guess :P
Everlasting_Joy: iirc, the enemies got gradually stronger as you leveled up, so basically fight difficulty was constant throughout the whole game.
Does mlponline.net work for anyone else?
Alchemist: Dang.
*hears about possible new star wars movies*....guys...plz...tell me its not true :(.....
GilDash: probably. but i didnt want to walloftext
Alright, what is it?
RainbowAsh, it's under a lot of strain right now

sorry man, but it is :(
wait... mlponline?
Dark_Horst: Essentially, each area has a set level range. A minimum level and maximum level, set when you enter the area for the first time.
they finished or something?
FFFFUUUUUUUUUU
Bye everyone. Gotta go.
*cries*
bye AdamTheDuck :)
bye AdamTheDuck
Dark_Horst, they just released the first single player episode, but their web page seems to be down
Disney produced Pirates of the Caribbean
OHO, WHO MIGHT THE GRANDDAUGHTER BE
Take care AdamTheDuck.
and Avengers
If gothic stuff is her thing she would probably love that
bye AdamTheDuck :)
Bye AdamTheDuck :)
You guys have been together 6 months, right?
The eyes.....OF EVIL!!!
VenHur: inb4 jar jar binks jedi?
Michael: [notamused face]
< I don't think that's how you spell Marquis. :S
littlekuriboh could work with this
GilDash i liked the other trilogy, but it wasnt all that good...i just hoped ur right
i see fire emblem on stream
*hope
7aye.
7seven in three days
Well if they DO feature Jar Jar Binks, I'd hope for them to make him a useful character.
I might not be the right person to judge this kind of thing, but necklaces I think are a good gift for that length of time
Robotdragon9: So do I. Either way, I'll be skeptical until I see something from them.
7Thankee.
Aye
Also, these are supposed to be sequel movies. Who knows if Jar Jar is still alive by that point?
7and yeah gothic stuff is her thing. less so now, mainly because of money issues.
Jewelry tends to mean you view it as serious, but something like a ring might be a little too serious
Polydunami: :(
So a dead Jar Jar will be sad?
btw happy belated halloween everypony
Polydunami: No, if he still is alive, that's sad.
Same to you, buddy.
7Ah. Thanks.
Robotdragon9: happy belated Nightmare Night!
Michael lol u too!
No problem
nope
wtf is happening in the stream?
You don't know if he'll actually be a good character or not if they feature him.
Friendship!
FRIENDSHIP, BITCHES!
Anyway, I don't know any more about the new Star Wars movies than you guys
Just waiting to see if Disney uses the expanded universe at all or reboots things.
my dad is taking me to town with 200$ and we are gonna shop around for geeky junk or whatever. I can buy some pony shirts and its the monday after season 3 release :)
All I know is that Disney produced good movies.
allo
maybe darth donald?
So how about Kingdom Hearts? Where would Star Wars fit into that? :D
Michael: I've got Vader lines running through my head as spoken by Donald.
Hey
...You know...the...park...from Disney World...
/me 11,01cleans Polydunami's heart
Hi, Polydunami. :)
7Evening Sirrah
Oh hey, AJIsAwesome|KIU
VenHur: It'd be interesting to see though.
KIU?
always buy your significant other something you would like so when they hate it you get it keep it.
lets hope disney is able to keep it as fun, exciting and dark as the other films and their earlier animated movies were
Whoops, Sorry Polydunami. :$
I meant to say hi to Nittany_Discord. :$
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
Oh, no worries, Nittany_Discord
Er, I mean, AJIsAwesome|KIU :S
Michael LOL
KIU stands for Kid Icarus: Uprising.
I am the force! I am the one! I. AM. GLASS!!!
:D
11,01Hi AJIsAwesome|KIU.
i just started reading "the hobbit"
http://i.imgur.com/DTCTq.jpg
Could always get a gift reciept if you're that sure they'll hate whatever you buy :P
Michael: :D
^:D
Darth Mickey?
Michael: :D
Also that completely rules out a lot of things, unless you like wearing women's jewelry
7haha. I intend to do that with games. she's a gamer but just has no patience. I'll get them after like two, maybe three weeks.
"Let's go to those houses and questiont he residents." How about we just beat the crap out of these bandits?
Michael: "My master, will you aid the dark side of the force?" "Ahuh, sure thing pal! If you do me one thing."
Sounds like me :P
imagine mickey saying "are u threatening me master jedi?"
disney imperium
"NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
Too bad Darth Vader is going to be long dead by the new movie's setting.
Aw...that's too bad...Darth Vader is a kick ass villain...
Polydunami: They'll perform some resurection spell on him or some garbage like that.
If I suck at a game I usually will just stop playing it because it's not fun
im currently playing through condenmed 2 and resistance 3
Too bad he died around Episode VI.
*le sad face
Or someone is going to pose as Darth Vader?
Possibly Luke himself? :D
miss lord vader :(
They could bring an old mark hammill back... With a beard.
7she won't suck at it, just has no attention span. It's impossible to get her to watch lengthy films.
I'm guessing they'll bring Mark back, somehow.
Ah, I see
hey guys did you hear ? disney just bought marvel slowpoke.jpg
i think the new empire's villans weren't as cool...from what ive seen
Depends if Hamil wants to come back or not.
Hey, I just heard Disney bought Pixar
:P
brb dinner
Inb4 The Star Wars series goes all Castlevania.
They'll be resurrecting obiwan, in a sense, by bringing back luke as obiwan mk2, to train someone else to fight against ...space ninjas.
*facepalms
VenHur: inb4 high school jedi
Oh, one more thing. Yoda will also be no more.
perhaps they'll base it off the eu
Michael: No, no, what I means is, A new Darth Vader arises, a new Skywalker must defeat the new Vader, bla bla bla bla blah. It's ridiculous, I know.
7although she does suck at every game
7every level on portal takes like an hour and a half.
7it's painful.
VenHur: IKR :)
I suck horribly at Portal ;-;
NewDCD? You alright?
what does the luck stat do
Or, I dunno, Disney could actually make an entertaining addition to the Star Wars franchise. I mean, it's a possibility.
Ok, Luke is the last Jedi, he's started a Jedi School. And just like that, it's a teenager movie.
>: (
I've told that story way too many times here though so I won't repeat it :P
7she just doesn't learn. she memorises instead, which requires her to simply hurl herself at every problem until she finds the correct solution, then memorises it and repeats until the level is done.
Kyle Katarn... just saying.
???
7we have occasionally discussed the negligence of her various schools for not at least testing her for a learning disability
She broked it
theres also mara
NewDCD? I think you need to turn down your background noise.
Star Wars: Jedi Karate Kid.
I AM SHOCKED
inb4 alternate universe where luke is a highschool guy who discovers the force, directed by Michael bay
"It came out effortlessly" lol
Episode 7: Jedi Kid. With Mark Hammill as Mr Myag...I mean Luke.
Sounds like she's not very easily offended. XD
Sell that sword to the next vendor.
Watch as they find a sword that out does the Mani Katti.
:D
So where would Old Princess Leia and Old Han Solo fit into this movie?
I'm back, missed anything?
Polydunami: Probably dead.
Wb VenHur
Nothing much, VenHur.
:(
I mean, they're not mentioned...
7Not really.
Hey, im new here, how do i shot web?
You were here a couple days ago.

IT'S THE FIRE EMBLEM THEME! FUCK YEAAAAH!
This isn't the actual Fire Emblem theme :S
You know, I've never really seen anything relating to Fire Emblem, but this is intriguing me.
It's THE Fire Emblem theme to me, God damn it!
Other than SSB?

Oops
Florina is the Fluttershy of this group.
And Star Ocean? And Terranigma?
7heh. fair.
A pegusis knight?! This game knows MLP BEFORE MLP!
You didn't scare me, Fluttershy. :D
...And it was 7 damn years before it...
7*shrug* we've both taken a lot of bullshit and survived. xD she's helped me a lot.
Yeah, no. MLP was around for a long time before Fire Emblem.
soo this is basically advanced wars in an older setting then?
Well, no, maybe a few years before

we were both each other's first "real" relationships, so I'm surprised we didn't screw up majorly

thelonepony, lol I don't think so. They just circle around and then sorta leave
GilDash I'm awfull with references please excuse my ignorence
When he first started talking to me I pretty much just thought there was no way he actually liked me and probably just wanted to be friends or felt sorry for me or something

AJIsAwesome|KIU, MLP_Brovakiin: I know right. Killed a skeleton and zombi spawner, got a record.
What ever happens to those silly voice acting? I like 'em...
nice one! :3
7ah. we started talking as friends and just... clicked. massively confided in one another for about two months, and it was very weird. I just hated myself endlessly then, had a fuckton of issues like self-harming, couldn't believe she possibly liked me. Plus, by all accounts she was a lesbian which really threw a spanner in things.
Dorcas is most probably dead.
VenHur: There's ya bad VA. Happy now? XD
I just saw a full picture of Florina; apparently, she wears boots that go all the way to her thighs :3

GilDash I'm relitively new so I have yet to experienc3e that joy
Roseluck`: That wasn't my mom, That was a taco...

Nittany_Discord: basically any hollywood movie teaches you that. Also hand grenades make a huge fireball when they detonate.
I dont do the whole party thing either, just feels awkward to me.
Roseluck`: :D
That is a commercial, Roseluck`
For tires
Stop analysing the joke. :p

Nittany_Discord, if i held a garage sale, would you buy my TF2 posters?
I mean, what's life without a sense of humour?

7heh. Me and some friends occasionally throw 'parties' where we take some tents to somebody's garden, light a bonfire and get hammered.
^^
11,01Roseluck`: No. Sorry.
Trust is a valuable resource. I can't just give it away to everyone NewDCD

Trust is much more plentiful than people realise, it seems :S
But then, people are people :|

I love the strange names the character have in these games
Erk, ugh

Polydunami: i love it <3
Sumica: By the way, which Gundam series would be best to start with? The very first one?
00,10kinda remind me of advance wars

Ahh, insantiy driving. Reminds me of my second lesson: Someone going the wrong way around a roundabout. Good times...
MadSurge dawwww <3 sooo cute
But also kind of awesome
NewDCD: reinforced bumbers, some spikes, structural struts
http://imgur.com/fCn2s -- something is VERY wrong with this picture... EXTREMELY wrong
We call them license plates, twilight_sprinkle, but other people call them number plates.
GilDash: one of the guys I took my driving exam with was conviced that one can leave a roundabout by taking a left turn.
Polydunami: oh okay, thx
NewDCD: if your car looks like something from madmax the others are gonna behave in proximity
NewDCD: that said, a gatling wouldnt be bad either
ello everypony :$
drinking age in canada is 19
Alchemist: depends which country?
Ah, insanity driving, NewDCD, haven't I told you this one time, I was driving in the tacomobile, seen some crazy bikers, drive like there's no tomorrow, reaching the end of the level and then...I felled off a cliff and got a game over...
Alchemist: I'm in England, so that would be correct. XD
...The life of a video game folks...life of a video game for me.

AJ is best background pony :$
Who's AJ again?

ello cachi01|scaryshit
GilDash: aj is that background texan pony
Hai cachi01|scaryshit :)
Oh hey, cachi01
hay cachi01|scaryshit how you doin?
I guess I would be chasing myself
I love AJ. :(
I am so alone.
potato_pony|: im good thx :) how bout u?
AJ is underrated
Same with Celestia
My Favorite Pony, you might be asking?
cachi01|scaryshit: You mean Braeburn?
ALL OF THEM
AJ fan or not, if you had a chance to go apple bucking with her, would you say no?
I mean really.
And that is NOT sexual.
celestia sucks :I
but AJ is kewl yeah
Ponies. GUys. PONIES.
im not celestia. im my original character Blelestia!
Not. Sexual.
:|
wait is potato_pony me or whaa? oh well I'm good too anyhow cachi01|scaryshit
we need to take fluttershys popularity, and push it somewhere else! like to AJ
^
Who is Fluttershy, again? :P
Barb|Meh: Probably, but I might hurt myself doing it. :D
Polydunami: ^
Hm.
its all about Caednce~
I just see you running right into trees.
and RD is just overrated
I may be a Fluttershy fan, but I AM A BIGGER FAN OF APPLEJACK, GOSH DARN IT!
Cadence
*
SHE EVEN HAD A CEREAL NAMED AFTER HER!
That is what happens after the enjoyment of finding out you are not only in equestria, but AJ needs your help.
cachi01|scaryshit: naa sfine I'm just being an ignorenet old kapoodle
or was she name after the cereal? :o
I actually prefer Celestia over Luna. :$
^
inb4 Cereal Velocity
:I
AJIsAwesome|KIU: :o
celestia sucks
Smack into the tree. Pass out. Mouth foaming. Does that sum it up AJIsAwesome|KIU ?
LUNAR REPUBLIC FTW
^
pfft
Barb|Meh: Pretty much. :D
wait....scary shit weekend ended?
twilight_sprinkle: Nox Aeterna.
Woona is cutest pony

hey RaveBrony if you don't mind me asking how did you give your pic the that overall dark tone ?i have no idea how to do/use shadows ._.
luna is gamer, I is gamer. done
inb4 Cadance Republic
I'm going to try to get some sleep now; soon-to-be in-laws are coming over in a few hours to help with invitations and I don't want to be dead. :P
Sadly that is also how you lost your first pony friend.
So is Cadence like the netural side between Luna and Celestia
Was Apple Jacks was named BEFORE the pony, or was it Applejack that was named BEFORE the cereal?
oh u AJIsAwesome|KIU
GilDash: i dont get it
Cadance is her own character
lol Apple Jacks
Well, what program do you have?
VenHur: I actually think it's the second choice.
AJIsAwesome|KIU: you mean the love monarchy?
SAI
Since MLP existed in the 80s.
twilight_sprinkle: Nox Aeterna is latin for Eternal Night.
*looks at the apple jacks in my hand*
but anyways Cadence FTW!
Shoot i dont know how to use sai yet :D
GilDash: lux
not nox
lol
cachi01|scaryshit: Nox means night...
Polydunami: I do hope she gets development and is not a one-shot character, though.
Yeah, same here
GilDash: ooooh i read that as light
I am now going to continue eating my Apple Jacks
sorry :$
also have gimp but i haen't use it so far
cachi01|scaryshit: What do I look like, a Celestian supporter? XD
Nightmare Night is over, cachi01|scaryshit. :D
KaitoThePony: you monster
well, for the overall darkness, i made a black layer on top and messed with the transparency :P
Given the chance to go apple bucking with Applejack, Heck Yeah, I'd do it....my feet would hate me for it - :D I wouldnt be much help kicking apples out of trees, but Im great at gathering
7haha
7okies
7nighty night
twilight_sprinkle no Apple Jack is beside me
organizing?
GilDash: u look like a gilda x dash supporter :3
Cypresswolf is Twi

I would probably PICK the apples instead of kicking the trees. :D
yay? :)
Night guys :p

Those trees are sturdy like HELL.

Good night, MaxTheBrony
uhmm then i'll have to found how to play with the transparency i guess
oky KaitoThePony
:)
cachi01|scaryshit: And how did you managed to work that one out? :p
Love =/= deception
wish i knew how to do proper shadows
twilight_sprinkle: Yue made me feel baaad
inception!
why did I just say that?
Lies within lies = deception.
^ thanks
GilDash: idk but maybe gildash also means.......APPLEJACK X PINKIE PIE? :O
no
just
no
cachi01|scaryshit: Nope, Pinkie Pie x Pokey Pierce.
ikr worst ship ever xd
lol KaitoThePony
cachi01|scaryshit: no worst ship ever is titanic
Aren't they making an actual Titanic ship?
*Titanic 2
cachi01|scaryshit: thats ship movie (or is there an actual ship called titanic 2)
why would you do that and i thought that already happened
oh hell no
I doubt it ALREADy happened, but I saw an article saying that one was in production.
that can only end well
What could possibly go wrong?
well, dont look at my pic if you wnt proper shadowing xD
nothing at all
Sorry, just thought they'd like to tempt fate a little more there. XD
I just went crazy with shading in different layers and messed with the transparency until it looked good enough for me :D

Maybe white is a color now?
HavokOC: It had bold in it though.
HavokOC: u got kik because of the script lol
oh lol
HavokOC: u should ask the mods for permission
Or do it in another chatroom...
yeah, probably xD
Sonny: I didn't even read them yet, but I've already like the way you draw the eyes
Petrified_Discord white is an overabundance of light and black is a significant lack in light.
OohShiny: why thankd you ;)
Petrified_Discord white is a colour >_>
wait, that was white?
purple is a fruit
I only got normal text T.T
HavokOC: you had Title Bolded
HavokOC the entire light spectrum
I would like to write a fanfic, put the problem Is that I don't know how to like "insert" the image into the piece I wrote
Oh lol
I'll figure it out tough...
Who's streaming?(if anyone is streaming)
Lunar_Brony: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1f5f4CEdJ1qdrhpf.gif
Sonny: well, I find it kind of easy on "inserting" images in a fic. If it's the way I'm thinking
Petrified_Discord: :D
Petrified_Discord xD
Petrified_Discord: :D
Sonny: do you mean like, make the fanfic based on the image or sumthing? or the image being the core to it?
Petrified_Discord: DUN DUN DUUUUUN :D
I'll make the image afther I'm done writing the fanfic :p
Apparently some blonde and her seemingly retard baby make $260 every day... SEEMS LEGIT!
Petrified_Discord: Dramatic

TheRandomkid321: like the "enlarge your penis" spam on the email
i clearly don't understand how the stream works ;-;
Damn, the brush tool makes drawing hair 100x times easier! I love it!!
OohShiny o_0
Sonny: so what's the Idea?
Stream = The staff team playing old video tapes from 3062
OohShiny: Well, I don't know if you read my comics yet, but here it goes
no idea how lol
11th doctor is best doctor.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: me!

HavokOC: I remember 3062 like it was 1050 years from now...
cachi01|scaryshit http://store.steampowered.com/app/38600/
In PSE (the program that came with my tablet), I would have to draw EACH amd EVERY strand of hair xD
Sonny: I'm actually doing an Amnesia: The Dark Pony fanfic..
it's free until November 8th after that is like 10 bucks i guess
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: AAAH BAD GAME!
With the brush tool not only does it draw 10+ lines, they all go in the same direction!
OohShiny: sweet
cachi01|scaryshit never said it was a great game
Anyway, TheGreatAndPowerfulT

Hi, sonicdude558.:)
For your pic, you want to shade the faces, but lighten the nose, lighten the cheek a tad bit, and give each pony a white glowy outline (make sure to watch the ponies behind each other, dont light where a pony would "blocking the light")
Hi sonicdude558 :)

OohShiny: I will, It's just that it's actually connectd with the event of celestia (as I displayed in the comics)
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: brb installing that thing

Sonny: so he went crazy, and celestia banished him?
sonicdude558: It's best not to disturb him. He's probably doing something important. :)

Hello~

Allos~
Hai Domo :)
/me glomps Domo "hi" :3
Hey Domo! :3
thelonepony: :| Stone cold killa
ohai Domo
I don't know why, but I named my OC Wander Syphon
Hi, Domo and Stephano! :)
/me hugs all of you. "Hi~"
it doesn't fit
OohShiny: So the thing is, afther he's done handeling the situation at hand that I'm making in the comics, he'll be a psychiatrist
and hai Stephano
Hi Stephano :)
/me glomps thelonepony, and shouts "Pileon!" ;3
*:3
:3
OohShiny: and he will be trying to help ponies with mental problems get back into society etc
Sonny: Just asking, Went conscious is correct to say?
OohShiny: Kinda sounds like a place
OohShiny: don't know :p
OohShiny: "We're gonna head on down to the Wander Syphon, wanna come?"
Petrified_Discord: Wander is something linked to eletronics
Petrified_Discord: while Syphon is Chemistry
I'm confused
OohShiny: I've been trying to improve my drawing skills, and there's an actual difference noticable between the first and last comic :D
OohShiny: Um...electrolosis. Bam. Electricity and chemistry.
*ysis
OohShiny: give me a sign when you're done reading them ok?
Sonny: np
Petrified_Discord: it's eletronics and telecommunications...
Petrified_Discord: any ideas?
Hmmm
OohShiny: The comics themselves are a little from one situation to another without an actual smooth line to go to the other part, (hard to explain in english) And I know that, just kind of the drawings that matter in these comics :p
Something Signal?
idk
/me gives up

Sonny: I suggest you put red heart instead of the spa sister, in the first one

in total xD
just go ahead and let your inspiration flow
not liturally 10
thelonepony: Heck, I'm still legit surprised they're doing content patches this big, while still updating GW1 with new content. Their staff must be made of crazy people.
And bronies, judging from the last GW1 quest.
I wrote 2 actual books and 8 times the amount of a book
at least

Sonny: I didn't write any books in my entire life, it would stop on the fourth ~ sixth chapter...
I also wrote some lyrics to some ideas of songs I had etc and some toughts I put on paper to set my mind straight

Ah, here we go. You're tasked with hunting down an invisible pony that has escaped from his master's pen, and you have to find it before the elite pony-hunting squad of undead comes to kill it.
OohShiny: I've wrote an actual song that I would LOVE to make and create, but I don't really have time for it (drawing commissions friends asking me out moving to another house homework etc)
Sonny: are you writing fics too?
OohShiny: I don't actually have any software for it eighter :p
Eli: I might write some yes ^^

Now since it's invisible, you have to track it by its "peripheral pony particles" (abbreviated as PON-3).

weeping_pegasi82, tailgaters on the damn road. Especially on the intersate.

Lower the Moon reminds me of http://derpy.me/1LFzZ
So how many planets have you been to, Phase4/
DA KERBALS!!

OohShiny: ikr
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: and?

OohShiny joke about it to gauge her reaction, then if signs are positive geek out. If it was me though I would unabashidly show all my pony love, at full throttle.
yeah, evidently listening to sabaton will make you a neo-nazi:|
I would be walking on the damn sun.

Meanwhile: its going to be better then citizen kane
THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
I was going for random, Vordox. It's working! Muahahaha!
DIS GON B GUD
OohShiny: The film looks like it was made by a 5 year old who fell onto a keyboard with a cgi program open.
were looking for a clampdown
So really that's entirely possible.
What's Mega Shark about?
Dark92Enigma: But the bashing will be OH SO SWEET. :D

more!
Superretroworld: Luv AVGN!
yay!
oh CrimsonPhoenix... I'm back
dat bass
orda seems more complex but as far as i can figure it actually merges the craft
"More chimneys, more!"
warp clamps is simpler but doesnt merge the craft, leading to a few bugs
dat circus!
Fluttershyfan158: eeyup, the new ghost and goblins one was awsome
woody the wood- *kasplodew*
StuffCrusader acme, just as technologiclly advanced as Aperture Science and just Laffibly Dangerious as them too

Sumica you are playing moonbase?
dat grapevine
00,10no

GarrettBrony, Acme isn't as advanced as Aperture.
I shouldn't have watched all those PTS
lion king of cats
lol
im not gonna lie, space jam got me into looney tunes
P-Peanuts
Sumica, still an absolute pain to get close enough, but mechjeb has some info that helps with that
OohShiny: IN cartoons it was possible
=
Dark92Enigma: ever watched any PTS?
i'm CROWNING YA
GarrettBrony acme will never be as good as apeture
A TWEETY BURD?
OohShiny: what it standed for again?
HE DID!
But it would be interesting to imagine a Roadrunner cartoon where Wile E Coyote uses Aperture tech instead of Acme... and fails just the same.
Dark92Enigma: Pony Thread Simulator
Can't watch this one. Someone let me know when it's over.
I TAWT I SAW A PUTTY TAT
I love that line :3
lion is unimpresed with hammers
that's what he sounds like

so is tweety a boy or a girl
StuffCrusader, boo
alexxm|foal: a boy
OohShiny: JK
ded
DEAD
OohShiny: I've heard of it, but never seen it
00,10fun fact, Tweety orignaly was not yellow.
DED
Alexxm: I really don't know?
StuffCrusader is actually better. I bet aperture and acme were in a joint venture with each other before the events of portal
alexxm|foal, tweety is a boy.
00,10cencors made them color him yellow so he would not look naked
Dark92Enigma: you should watch it, you're in for a threat
alexxm|foal: i've grown up thinking he was a she :D.....big mistake
Black Mesa or Aperture? which would you rather work for?
GarrettBrony tottaly. that would be one interting game...
Portal3 looney tunes physics edition
Sumica, was Tweety black and white orginally?
Resonance Cascade or Deadly Neurotoxin?
eat it
xD
there's no oxygen in the stomach
ooh there is
Taco bell does the same to me.
not really
I'm thirsty now
taco bell giving you diahrea is really overrated
Fluttershyfan158 actually fire is better on the stomach than tacobell
Fluttershyfan158 oh tell me about it
Fast growing fur
:P
HAHAHA!
I eat Taco Bell and my stomach is fine.
^
WITHOUT NET
NO NET
AttackWithHugs: AJIsAwesome THANK YOU
Well, okay. The Resonance Cascade was the only thing that went wrong at Black Mesa. Much more terrible things went on at Aperture.
ok then let me rephrase that..Chipotle
Fluttershyfan158: um no
loony toons?
AttackWithHugs: imposible
Bronysith, my sister can eat certain things at Taco Bell.
Bronysith oh no it isn't, well it depends on who is working there and how spiteful the cooks are
OohShiny: give me link via PM i'm busy right now
once i ate wendys and i threw up everywhere. that's why i refurse to eat ther
cachi01|scaryshit, POSSIBRU.
putty tats.
Taco truck food does me in :P
shit
00,10he's been playing hl2
*there
AttackWithHugs: it's not the stomach that is the problem, the problem is your intestine
It makes you bleed out your ass (get it?)
DERPS EVERYWHERE
Fluttershyfan158: you're only saying that cause popular society tells you this,
StuffCrusader, it was probably just that one location.
TA-DA
OohShiny, my intestines handle Taco Bell pretty fine
it's behind him
OMG
:D
Kandarihu|Zoro meh... i didn't like the food anyway
Kandarihu|Zoro well it depends on who is working there and how spiteful the cooks are
It's over, Meanwhile.

Moonshine doubles as gasoline - good to know :P

Make some moonshines with them corn dripin's
Another thing i remember from Betty Boop, is that she has 100 AND one crushes
CypressWerewolf: Yep indeed it does. That gasahol
"Hot Betty Boob"? :|
SafariMonkey: TAB fail......MAJOR TAB FAIL
hey its that song!
WELP, that was harmless enough
SafariMonkey: well, she was hotty in Who Framed Roger Rabbit... At least for me when I was a kid
WELL*
00,10what happend to the guy with the tank
I've always wanted to try moonshine - I think (not 100% sure) its legal in Texas as long as you dont sell it
THAT SONG.........
Dark92Enigma: How so?
<3 Croonerrs
more betty boop...
Love this song :D
humans in a cartoon!
Minnie the Moocher
o.o
oh yes i saw this in blue brothers
00,10CypressWerewolf, moon shine is legal so long as you pay the government it's dues
SafariMonkey: people will misunderstand it
Those Angel Skates
Thats why I love black & whites - the creativity :D bunnies into skates
One day, I will drink moonshine.
show the dodo cartoon
Dark92Enigma: How?
it was B&W too
00,10most moonshine is even sold in mason jars
i dont understand this cartoon
mm hmm
poor dog
mason jars are fine china in my house

this sounds like an ytpmv already
who's streaming?
Domo
move your cabboose
Safe Safe
dat ass
Sex, it makes the lame walk again
suddenly bonner
bad ass spider
Babies with beards......
what?
SafariMonkey: just my opinion, but i guess it's too gratuite to have the ''p'' in BOOP changed for a ''b''....sounds like a parody name.....and i die a little on the inside......i die of laughter :D
well... if you think about it, betty's clothes in a real woman would look REALLY suggestive
00,10this whole cartoon is just a realy music video
why is it famous?
00,10realy early music video
THE OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAIN
that skull rock in the background :)
Sumica: A great many were, actually. It was at first the most popular genre-- in an age where cheap escapism was sorely needed.
dat rotoscoping
holy shit it is
Dark92Enigma: Well, it said "For more hot Betty Boob click here" as a youtube link on the video on stream. That was what I was commenting on.
so, am I the only one Betty's cute?
Im getting some awesome buffers tonight :)

Night StuffCrusader :3
00,10this song renders well
Cya StuffCrusader
82 minutes of random songs together
highest score on audiosurf ever
So is there a button that you press to add the combo to your score or is it automatic?
1.- get audiosurf 2.- get ballon party album 3.-????? 4.- profit
In me playing Audiosurf one time, the track didn't render
There was literally nothing
0,14if I had to play Audiosurf, it'd be just a lot of fighting game music >.>
0,14not sure how well that carries over

00,10dragon force comes with autio surf
i still don't know how shizu get her score in this one ...
0,14I can guess why
gaming skillz
How exactly does this combo system work?
00,10never notice temo controls speed
AJIsAwesome: The more yu stack the higher the ponts. It auto adds to your score.
AJIsAwesome bigger block the more worth, colors have a certain value cold colors are the least while hot colors worth more
13there it was
05,15Loves me some Daft Punk
0,14and dat Weezer
So if it auto adds, how do people manage to get higher scores even if people get the same blocks?
13there's another
AJIsAwesome: by making no mistakes
different combos left pass one block and add the next ones
AJIsAwesome: Also when using powers in game you lose points.
nope
only with mono
yeah
and that's to remove greys
yeah
the ninja stars

hi Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
sup Big_Macintosh_1992
/me attacks AttackWithHugs with hugs
05,15I don't know why, but music can really make a video game stick in my head
0,14^
^^
^^^
05,15For example Black Mesa's soundtrack is ZOMG AWESOME, therefore I will remember specific moments in that game
0,14it's how I got Woodkid's Iron, The Heavy's Short Change Hero and Lykke Li's Get Some
Hi, Big_Macintosh_1992. :)
Chrono Trigger to me
hey there AJIsAwesome
Music sticks in my head and I will search up and down youtube and google until I find the name of it
Is the Android version of Chrono Trigger any good?
05,15Seriously Questionable Ethics 1 is boss
Then play the hell out of it and then I discover a new artist
I heard it was the DS version.
Spell-of-Gaming: it's pretty much the same for the android
iron is so fucking awesome i love AC:Revelation trailer
05,15and Deus Ex HR has fantastic music as well
And I remember this song from one of Shizuka's streams earlier this year
Spell-of-Gaming: in the DS there is an extra part, where Schala fusions with Lavos, creating the time devourer from Chrono Cross
i came across a game kind of like audiosurf... but its online and free

This music is so lovably funky

0,14I'd like to toss up Guilty Gear
fluttercry have you play eternal sonata ?
0,14and all of Daisuke Ishiwatari's songs
05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT I did, but I didn't like it. However my taste in games has changed a lot since then so I might feel differently now
Spell-of-Gaming: it's worth it
I don't have a lot of games but I do admit that the music from the Spyro trilogy is awesome
ohh but the soundtrack is soooo gooood
Because Stewart Copeland

Ryunosuke: it's wrong

My nervous testplot, My nervous testplot, ah ah ah ah
Is anyone else having issues with the thing saying the broadcast has ended, even though its clearly not because a refresh brings it back?
Ryunosuke: think about it: "They are a she"
I am.

fluttercry: everone gets over 9000 in temple run lol

or emo i guess would be a better word
emo

i mean, he whines more than tifa :\
*yuffie
whining + tifa = rawr
hell, even that little girl was more willing to fight
lawl cashie
/me has never played a Final Fantasy game
^
Ditto.
i only played crisis core on psp
/me feels no shame
^^^^
#same
crisis core was fuuun
Shizuka: is popular from bronystate but.....i dont know, but is she popular on youtube?, is she even on youtube?
/me plays as many kingdom hearts games as she can
the good ones
i've only played ff 1,2,3 dissidia,dissidia 012, ffX, ffXIII, ffXIII-2
epic thrash metal part NOW
oh i also played dissidia demo, as also tons of fun
i always wanted to play crysis core
is? it good
is it good?*
cachi01|scaryshit: do it, its awesome, especially the story and characters. the one problem are the side missions
I have 2 friends who are into Kingdom Hearts and have tried to get me into it. Problem is, I don't have anything to play the games on, except 3DS/DS which is only 2 games.
cachi01|scaryshit: you only need to do the side machines if you want to get magic and items and moves you cant normally get
*side missions
epic solo
twilight_sprinkle: the battle system is like kingdom hearts or rpg?
this part . . .
cachi01|scaryshit: ive never played kingdo mhearts, but in cc its not turnbased, from what ive seen of kh ts like kh
oh ok
very very busy bee
...can not unhear
:D
SEPHIROTH
SANTA CLAUS
also, sephiroth was baws in cc
dammit brentalfloss
13a) that was a very treble heavy song...
Kingdom Hearts is an RPG, but the battle system crosses between something I can only describe as RPG and action-swordfighting
13b) i was certain for a while there it was going to break into E1M1 of doom
lol
it also differs on which game in the series you play
E1M1?
Shizuka: you should do that one
each has a unique battle system
Shizuka: E1M1
whats e1m1
eva?
movie 1?
twilight_sprinkle: episode 1
mission 1
doom
o ok
/me pokes his head in chat "You guys awake?" :3

Night otakon
I really hate to though, but I must get some sleep, thanks for the stream Shizuka it was fun :) night all you wonderful bronies, take care and be good :)
I know my choice for A movie was picked for tomorrow, but like always, I'm busy Friday nights :(
Goodnight otakon
Night otakon
Polydunami: You busy Sat?
Not likely
You mean Saturday morning?
I meant Saturday afternoon during the Euro Night showing of it
Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus.
So long as they show the A movie first.
Most creative movie title ever.
Polydunami: Course they will
My guess is this title fits the category of "Best movie no one ever saw".
13i blame those two grey block hits on otakon
13distracting me over here >>
:O
/me hits otakon with a spoon :|
well I never...
Bad otakon
