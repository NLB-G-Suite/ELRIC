DerpyMuffins, HECK no!
DoctoDoctorWho: nope. He was gonna die from a nuclear reaction. Which he absorbed Before Destoroyah became that powerful. So, Even without D there, G would have died.
Murica:D
What, we don't even get to see it eaten? What, did the shark jumping to eat the airplane eat up all the movie budget too?
That ship had less than 2 minutes of screen time
No, I wanted to see the Giant shark.
Rise and shine mr. Freeman...
well... their budget didn't allow for satifying action
CriticKitten: most likely, yes
SWAT!
Doubletap!
'MURICA

Damnit
Suddenly the SWAT.
wat
Deal with It.
ho ho ho
Even the army guys are stereotypical.

That shark is going to take an airplane... AND EAT IT!
Invi: And the Army could have killed him due to Weaksauce Weakness.
:D
How did the shark get mega again?
aliens
I missed most of th emovie
wasnt this soldier one of the suit guys?
I'm guessing this movie's a stinker eh?

If this is Treasure Island, where is the Treasure?!
DerpyMuffins: It's Extinct,. :P Old shark kind
Yes, we know, he's irish

Uncle Sam needs you to kill a shark.
Hi, Brony2447. :)

Hai Brony2447
hi Brony2447
We get it, you are Irish!
hey Brony2447
Katrina?
Sharktopus owns this movie
Wat.
DerpyMuffins: Because he lived 1.5 million years ago and yet reappeared through global warming ;P
That is a very bad excuse for a monster
haw haw haw
how are all yall
....oh, he's Japanese.
That explains the squid.
He was created by Supa Radition.
DerpyMuffins: Never seen the masterpiece Aliens vs Predators?
Seppuku?
Welcome to HELL Brony2447
Brony2447: nice, and you? :)
Yes I have Vordox
Tentacles for the Japanese, yay :D

This dude is the burn master
If you've seen that, MONSTERS can survive in ice :P
Michael: good! :) i just made another MLP hand sketch
Seismic suction?
Of course in every monster movie there is a japanese
Stereotypical Army douche guy :/ i despy these characters
Wat
IT'S TRUE.
despise*
oh boy, this guy is ridiculous
That is not a thing.
Lil_B, agreed
Brony2447: omg nice :$
Vordox, but alien can survive anywhere. your argument is invalid ^^
I refuse to believe that "seismic suction" is a thing
Here is the asshole we all know
TKist: btw i've been to hell before, it's very nice now
Kandarihu even in comedies where they do it intentionally I hate it
Invi: Never seen Godzilla'? He was frozen for several decades :P
Unless perhaps "seismic suction" refers to this movie
Oh no Earth has Chicken Pox!
yay
How do we know its a he?
/me Hugs Brony2447
TKist: :) thx
they just touch the CD surface
hades treats me real good
Welcome brotha

DESTRUUUCTIIOOON
Yes, you fucking can

They're giant monsters that want to KILL US. Containment? Screw that.
Gonna need a bigger pokeball.
Shell them to death
"Don't you bleedin' heart liberals tell me what can i annihilate:|"
Its shoot to kill, not contain

Use the whole worlds population as bait
Naval Intelligence? Dat oxymoron
Apokalipse: XD

Look at all those buttons!
sounds like hes taslking about the USA
lol wtf treasure island
You just said this.
SCIENCE MONTAGE!!!
You know what? The stereotype has a point. The monsters cannot be contained, and are killing innocent people.

SUDDENLy
SCIENCE
Wtf?
Now its science?
https://twitter.com/tarastrong/status/264548653878898688/photo/1 - tara strong drinking coffee ... naked :)

Invi: nah, they'd be more interested in the octopus, if ya know what I mean
and then everyone clicked
We need to continue... "Testing"
cue stock science montage music
giant monsters: resolve it with science
DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not saying Destoroyah isn't one of the strongest enemies Godzilla ever had. Just that the MGs always did more damage to him.
well, they write Stuff down, thats the first step towards real science
Invi: of course it is :D
Team of crackshot scientists. Testubes.. Scientists!
Oh something explode already
Ah, back for this perfect movie
Wonder if that is juice.
ok idk if this is offensive (sorry if it is) but what is a furry
DoctoDoctorWho, hehe true
Dafuq
Too tired must dream of giant shark.
<---- The reason why B Movie is in BMN, it's GOOD :p
I say we gave the mÂ³ of Ambien
So why did the movie now suddenly go into science?
inb4 Ohmai
Lil_B, the what of what? ^^
DerpyMuffins find a way to defeat them
Love interest.

I dont even need to watch the movie, I know exactly whats goin on just by listening to you guys
3rd kiss.
pheromones = Mountain Dew
This movie is unbearable
They're hoping for a nuclear reaction then?
<---- That guy reminds me of Shark Connery
DerpyMuffins: Watch "Danger! High Voltage!" by Electric Six. Spoiler: It does.

he was still screaming after the plane exploded...
He sounded like "Oh my goooood" guy from Troll 2:D
Lil_B, no. the tentacle was legit :D
Not an epic explosion.
More like Fire all the actors Michael
nevermind the damn pilot
ever heard of torpedos?
Well maybe there was visual audio desyncing...
Sundaysmile: just put a bomb on that place and, enjoy the fireworks
Invi yeah... I guess I can't argue that, but everything else! the Dialoge didn't match with the action at all!
Just Kill the shark!
I kidna want some kalimari now
dat intense stare
Lil_B, and actually nothing happened during that scene :D
Suddenly sunrise.
Invi appearently xD
it's a good day...
she looks like she's smelling a cat turd
She wants that Asian Guy again.
Invi but I am in a good mood... both monsters have not left the Pazific, no harm for Europe

Worst than a storm trooper
it's 2009, underwater Torpewdos and Mines haven't been invented yet
Eli: SORRY took too long
My god... it's not working.
underwater FLAK?
all the fails
It would be cooler if the shark had a laser beam attached to its forehead.
Flash boom
"We can't see! Let's shoot some more until we can!"
Vordox, please don't compare these morons with my country.

Nope

ya givin me seizures
oh no, flashes of shit we already saw!
dem eyes
Bad dream?
did her family get eaten by wild megalodons?
CriticKitten: all they know is how flashes work... and not even that very well
I WOULD say the BIG LIPPED ALLIGATOR MOMENT joke, but this is somehow contributing to the plot.........
Whut?
Bitch to the KITCHEN!!!:D
....
GENIUS STRIKE
Nittany_Discord well, that were normal nukes, just tested underwater, to keep damage and radiation down, but the tidal wavers are still very hazardous to both landslides and ships
da fuq?
Then just say that
Jeezus Fahck
wrong use of ZNNT!

Why would you say "Rilla in Manilla"?

never thinked of that!?
That's the stupidiest line ever uttered

BRILLANT IT MAKES NOT SENSE!
By the way the Shark is a MEGALODON.......but that's no excuse for biting off a plane, and a fucking bridge
CriticKitten, thriller
11,01Not from nukes. The waves would disperse before hitting land.
:3
/me takes drugs and nukes whales
this is AWESOME
"They're natural enemies!"
Stop trying to be sciency! It kills me! just do the fight, I'm sure people will pay for maximum bloodbath with minimum talk
They gonna 'come' together alright
11,01Waves would only be a problem near the explosion.
No, they're not.
They're a shark and an octopus.
They are NOT natural enemies.

DerpyMuffins: By the way you mean WMC (Worst Movie Clause)..........and i say, this movie is unimpressive and lame, but it's not worthy of the clause
Sundaysmile: Too deep
but it's metal
They need to go deeper?
well... these 2 monsters are unstopable forces, according to the Movies understanding of physics and Logic, this should create a black hole
These monsters are immune to sonar, so I guess they're screwed now
This movie is pretty funny, but I don't think we need to watch it again after this.
DEPPER EH? http://inception.davepedu.com/
SirGanjalf: OR DERPER 6_9
I don't know HOW one becomes immune to sonar but apparently they are
Lil_B: it makes sense <_<

ekips, no, vote for transmorphers next :D
Do you see his glasses?
ekips, I don't want to see this movie again.
They're impractically small
Godzilla made more sense than this
next B movie should be sharktopus
They're not even an inch tall
no it doesn't
where's godzilla when u need it?
Somehow
it doesn't make sense
nothing makes sense
This movie only deserves a 6-MONTH BAN. THAT'S all it gets

Invi: Audiosurf is based on BPM, not notes.
My other name is asdawasda

Lauren pretty much just confirmed the re-airing of The Powerpuff Girls.

This part of this song
Deacon: i dont remember songs from tales of symphonia
where have I heard this before?
Vordox, well if you play everything simultanously (short notes) then it might become hell ^^

Invi: But yeah, that's piano. :P Not the other
DashWithRainbows: kicked?

Buytoast Merzbow?

MaxTheBrony, cool :>

Nite everypony, HF with the music :)

Playing Merzbow on audiosurf would give you an empty level
d3rb_ agreed
who plays survivor beta
ouch
i've liked electronic music for the last 13 years so i hear the "real" music thing alot, its annoyingf
is that merzbow stuff supposed to be staticy?
Yeah
goddamn
he sets fire to vinyls and plays them
well that's wasteful
well not just that obviously
it's--non-music
Gnight everypony! :)
d3rb_: well you had it coming.
"sound poetry"
well im going to search
4 a game
Goodnight Michael|FF7 :)
d3rb_: playing with sounds on a computer isnt music
MaxTheBrony: From first glance, I would focus some more on drawing the viewer in on the picture...maybe create some more contrast by adding lines, not only shading :)
that never ends
well at least it's not dubstep
o wait
cachi01, actually it is
Hehehe
i have minecraft
MINECRAFT
d3rb_: well this world is really turning to shit

13must be boring ponies..

nite Michael|FF7
mate i dont care if you dont like electronic music, i even undetrstand why but its music, like it or not cachi01
Iwa: I have a problem otherwise that i do to thick lines and fuck everything up but i think you are right , do you think it would work if i just changed the background to something darker?
Shizuka: plz play goodtime or a black eyed peas song

O-O-O-O-OVERHYPED SONG STYLE
goddamn
MaxTheBrony: But yes, on other notes: I do like your drawing style, I wouldn't change that :3
I kinda hate humour music-
Bronysith: not sure if troll
and I just really--did not like anything about the little of Gangnam I heard
Iwa: Thank you :3
i like ganghan style since its pissing off so many people
well hate is too strong, I'm not a fan of humour in music
d3rb_: gangnam

Both
rap sucks
I hate normal rap :p
love nerdcore tho
MaxTheBrony: I love dan bull! :D
I--barely got into pony music, only got into it because I really liked PinkiePieSwear
Wierd al!
only tolerable rap is humour and parody rap
game-rapping? I'll check it out, but probably wont like it
Ello bstate
MLP_Brovakiin: Hes awesome :D
hi HoodyNinja :)
MaxTheBrony: I love his dishonoured rap :)
We really shouldn't discuss about what is good music. Nobody can win in that discussion
Hai HoodyNinja :)
ha, pony music. you mean sound clips played over and over again for 4 minutes
MLP_Brovakiin: Yah its epic
Heya HoodyNinja :)
Well discussing what we like in music is fun
ekips, spot on mate
discussing what is superior is silly, but can still be fun
well, the best horse is the yelow one so you're wrong there
Buytoast sadly that is a lot of it
ekips: That is true :)
Buytoast: are u kidding me? best quine is the light red one
I only really like PinkiePieSwear
equine*
Buytoast, but applejack is orange :P
i like da lyrics of this song
Video game music>Any other song ever
dat barrel roll
Bronysith: D'awww <3

So much daw Bronysith
Vivix: Aight :D

Not the glaze! ;~;
DO YOU ATLEAST HAVE SOMETHING?
beastie boys, hell yeah Vivix
even if he more sings in that song- ah well
Hehe

Weird Al is the MAN!
Not only he makes music, he made music funny!
Damn you bowser!

HOW DOES IT FEEL BEING ON THE RECIEVING SIDE PSY!
This is much better than the original Gangnam Style
Slamjam > Gangam style when it comes to "Slammify"
HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY SEXY LADY
I think I prefer the original Korean.
Vordox, your very passionate about slamjam
d3rb_: I prefer Slam then Style song
d3rb_: *you're
than*
seriously, gangnam style is too damn awesome
The original Gangnam Style became too annoying as hell
Bronysith: Nah, it's just been overexpoed
exposed*
There's MILLIONS of better songs
But they don't get exposed.
mute button wasnt working so i had to close browser :I
i hated gangnam before it was cool
hipster_sprinkle: :D
That's why you dig your own song and find songs NOONE heard that deservest to be heard.
Vordox: thats internet for you
making good song != becoming famous
ekips: Sad truth :(
ekips: dat programming notation
that was epic
Shizuka: Got any Dubstep that's good(Ponified)? =P
well every pony i am going to hit the hay good night
hipster_sprinkle ikr? ;)

Vordox: that exists?
Oppan Ganganam Style = Asian Rickroll?
Even with ponies on them Shizuka ?
cachi01: Luna?=P
13nothing can make dubstep into music
Vordox: THe exposing wasn't because of the song itself-- it was because they made a very quirky video to go with it. Otherwise, it would have quietly sank into obscurity, really.
Vordox: luna has dubstep?
dubstep>gangnam
Shizuka: morrowind please?
13no good for audiosurf
cachi01: Really? never heard the song Luna?
13too calm

Bronysith: It's not a game music...
I hear organs
Bronysith, have you hear Gangnam Style orchestrated?
Vordox: i know
AttackWithHugs: of course
Video games didn't even EXIST back in those ays :P

Vordox: i know its not video game music
classical is more than just orchestral music, it usually has thought behind it
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU

I have a hard time listening to songs like this
I would love to hear this song in an Castlevania game. :$

Some Dwarf Clan should start here a fortress.
cachi01, why a sacrifice in an ice cave? Why not near a lavafall?
AttackWithHugs: cause thats mainstream
AttackWithHugs: KALIMA!
Cold hearted people do sacrifices in ice caves.
because in an ice cave, no one can hear you scream . . .
Just the way it is
^^
AttackWithHugs freeze them to death as sacrifce
cachi01, but lavafalls! Think of the lava gods!
13what a well designed village

Hopefully the villagers have ladders or something to get up to their houses

AJIsAwesome: well duh, can't you tell? He also was Pinkie Pie in Apple.mov!
cachi01: On EverFree Radio
[INSERT SOME COLT HERE]
Hey Everypony!! :)
J_E_Smith71: yay brb
hi DerpDash
there are colts? I thought this was a mare's show
Spell-of-Gaming: dat colt in the background
lali-ho DerpDash
So...who's streaming?
Shizuka
DerpDash: Shizu is :3
DerpDash!
well if you can't tell by the bug, it's shizu
Oh >.<
I was on ebay today and I got Twilight Pinkie and Rainbow Dash plushies all in one x3
Some websites can do that
/me is oblivious to shizu tag in the corner
K, imma head out no, bbl
latas
must've costed you alot Rainboom
Rainboom: ENVYYYY
Deacon: Yeah
laters hoo-- oh
Only downside is that they show a ton of ads
Getting pony plushes on ebay is hard <_>
13this is mostly just a proof of concept
13going to need to find a buildcraft solution that doesn't overflow pipes
msut be, seeing as the average plush is around $50-100
I don't want to go, sprinkles. ;~;
13since redpower isn't out yer
Rainboom nice! I can't find an RD plushie that I like. If her eyes don't look right to me I won't buy it. Unfortunately, even if I do find a high-quality plush, it's either extremely expensive or not for sale.
Deacon: I saw a perfect AJ plush for like 400$
13awful efficient though
I got the Twilight Pinkie and Dashie ones combined for like 60$ though
Shizuka it looks pretty cool either way . . . what does it do exactly? I'm popping in and out of BS.
oh, neat
they werent the best but hey at least it was ok
is there going to be a PPPS today?
13for every ore that goes in the left chest
13it enters a macerator that produces two dust from the ore
13then into a furnace that smelts one ingot per dust
13so instead of ore > furnace > ingot, i get ore > macerator > furnace > 2x ingot
ah
nice
IM PRINCESS CELESTIA COME FLY WITH ME =D
PPPS?
and then everything gets deposited in the end chest
oh the podcasdy
dunno
oops
13only problem is the macerator can only really process one stack, the furnace can process two
sorry bout that, accidentally closed this tab
lol
13if the pipes try to push more in, it overflows and they pop out
Shizuka I need to start playing with pipe so I can do that automatically
Shizuka: you're a real minecraft-aholic aren't you?
13need to find a way to fix that, not sure how with just buildcraft
13redpower's pipes let the items bounce back and forth until they find somewhere to land
13but redpower isn't ready yet
make their travel longer ?
o.o;;
Fillies I want to hug for life besides the CMC: Pipsqueak Twist and Rumble :)
I'm guessing you can't split the pipes into 2 paths
13well you can, so i could wire up more furnaces
http://i.imgur.com/OhyOe.gif
13but would be more efficient to not pull the ore until it's needed
13not sure if that can be done with buildcraft alone
13have to read up more
Bronysith: Poor Giraffe :c
hey every pony guess who
http://i.imgur.com/swPpI.jpg
chicken poo?
Hello therainbowvortex
you can pipe out the overflowing ones from the bottom of the macerator and loop it back until theres room
lali-ho therainbowvortex
hey AdamTheDuck
13anyhoof
Bronysith, .-. nice image
13oh is that the trick
So much lol Bronysith
13would still rather it not try to pull from the chest until the macerator needs ore
http://imgur.com/aIiKp
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/8373/
So much pink text ^^
13anyway think i will call it a night here

Bronysith: He's gone.
Sith, if you're talking about that anon, he was banned by LC
MadSurge: yep owo
DashWithRainbows: sorry for wasting ur time..
MadSurge: I am too. :)
You guys need to realize that mods lurk this chat.
MadSurge: would that be a problem?
Domo and AJIsAwesome: AWESOME!
btw Afflict if your going to use that name from now on, youl have to put your password in
DashWithRainbows they don't know the meaning of Lurk Moar
Eli: not for me
MadSurge: that's a no then :)
if you want to keep your voice
alexxm Personally now i see why it's a classic, but the trick was to pay extra atttention to the dialogue, since it's of vital importance to the plot. Even if sometimes it seems more dialogue-driven at times, it deserves a 7/10

Lunar_Brony: oh shit, what have i done?
http://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/939740.jpg
I don't know, but it's hilarious!
I found Gangnam "okay" the first 2 times. After that, it just got very annoying to me.

/me throws Dark92Enigma into hell
I havent seen it...nor do I want too.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuDJORBqazI&feature=BFa&list=FL4H8Vg30mN_BaGU-7zbh6Yg
WallDives: Don't bother. You're not really missing out on anything. But you're welcome to. :)
One can never hate Gangnam Style until your school plays it over the announcement system as the daily morning music.
What Would You Do If: You're in the woods and Pinkamena pops up. She smiles and asks you to come see her new basement, you accept. When you see the basement, everything is fine, but then she asks you to go in a shed. Accept or decline?
Lunar_Brony: Augh.
Lunar_Brony: i hated it from the moment i heard it and looked at the like bar
Lunar_Brony: wow. really?
Lunar_Brony: Wow. THat SUCKS. :D
I'd shoot her because she's a pony that talks. Reality ensues.
Rainboom: accept
Lunar_Brony: WTF
^my reaction
smile smile smile!!!!
Wow today has been majorly distracting for me. Watching Dan vs. Then watched the original intro to MLP, then the Italian version of my little pony intro etc
It also seemed that half the school was dancing to it. However, I am both dissapointed and pissed because they played "Thriller" last Monday and nobody danced.
RDash5000: i had a major depression this whole month and i decided to listen to that song..... now i love life
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
vuela y ve my little pony y muchas amigas podras encontrar
english, pls
I remember the good times on Saturdays when new episodes of MLP were on the bronystate screen and we watch Aquabats before it :D
WallDives: espaÃ±ol prfs
Lunar_Brony: everyone dances to gangnam because its easy, same reason people like it, its an elemntary tune
twilight_sprinkle yeah, and Thriller is easier.
i became a brony after they finished season 2 :P
Lunar_Brony: yeah but most dont remember thriller

Not all dubstep is bad, IMO. It's just that most dubstep doesn't utilize the instruments used in dubstep well.
yeah i just watched that panel Derpy_Hooves

goddamnit PSO, stop being perfect
seeya RDash5000
wait Daylight savings is coming to an end....forever?
NewSuperBronyU: so how was SWAG.MOV? :3
NewSuperBronyU: I was just about to say something about you. I take it you're not staying at the dance and just taking it easy now after that long day?
11,02Egoraptor came to EQLA :D
11,02J_E_Smith71: Yeah
NewSuperBronyU, what's going on now?
Your giving me a flashback of this youtube video now that I saw years ago
11,02AttackWithHugs: A dance party
LOL
11,02But I'm so upset now...
:D
I hope Jon "Tons of Dumb" Tron wasn't there too
NewSuperBronyU: why?
#Vinyl_Scratch
So ends the first day of EQLA, and all that's left is the dance party
11,02I had the reaction video recorded of the SWAG.MOV trailer...
NewSuperBronyU, I'm watching the stream and I don't see a dance party
Uh oh
11,02And the first 15 minutes
Uh oh
11,02I deleted it by accident
Found my new name
NewSuperBronyU: and what happened......
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
damn
.....
-_(\
11,02So
:(
I give no fucks about SWAG.Mov
wait.....
11,02Kind of sad now :(
FIRST 15 MINUTES?
HOWLONG IS IT?
11,02But Max and Egoraptor almost got kicked off stage
:D
Why?
NewSuperBronyU: xDDD why?
I don't watch the .mov videos . . . why do I care?
I care!
looking for somethin to do~
11,02They were so vulgar and rude that it seemed like the staff were at a scramble to fix it
:o
13what a shock
Eh, their fault
ha
Not really suprising
NewSuperBronyU: oh yeah i heard max insulted fluttershy
not a surprise.
lol
11,02Calling people homosexual, gay, swearing a lot, etc.
13again what a shock
" "
13when you're plugging the .mov series
there's something i'd like to see
goddamnit Equestria daily i do not want to see an 8 minute preview of a 1 hour show
night every pony even thouge its only 4;pm over here im tired
hey there :)
oh no. im unexplicably inflating again
It's not registered
i dont see any SWAG.MOV anywhere on youtube
.
flutterchu: Not ready yet
good night therainbowvortex
night therainbowvortex
11,02night therainbowvortex :)
flutterchu: First two minutes were shown at the EQLA panel
Wut
This isn't either?
Night therainbowvortex
the .mov productions are of questionable intellectual quality, no doubt...
:o
flutterchu: you said you had a youtube account what's the name?
but....acceptance, shizuka?
weeping_pegasi82: BuildermanVSNotch.......why do you ask?
don't even know what you are talking about
Shhhhh! its my favorite part on the Buffer show! :O
Uh NewSuperBronyU you better mention your Twitter you erased the footage then
I question the .MOV videos' intelligence
flutterchu: forgot to ask earlier my mind is weird :P
11,02Got an error tweeting it
This one is registered
13the .mov series is why this fandom will ultimately collapse
hello
:D
Shizuka: nah
hi pony_3546
I blame the Jews
Shizuka: And why people hate us
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-3qncy5Qfk&feature=fvwrel
i blame dinkleberg
will this site stream the new pony episodes?
I'm gonna keep this one
13no we never stream ponies here ever
pony_3546: yes
that link has strong language btw
pony_3546: Yes. :)
swesome
NewSuperBronyU: Only 13 tweets and they already have you at the limit?
but i thought it was hilarous
13oh also, daylight savings ends tonight in the us
Ask Tom pony_3546
pony_3546: You new here? :$
then i can add th RD theather in my auto pony program that im writing :3
13so get that extra hour of sleep tonight
yes im new here
Shizuka ugh, tell me about it. I nearly had a heartattack when my sister clicked on "Shed.mov". She's 6.
looking for streaming sites
11,02Was able to send the message
Welcome to the herd pony_3546
thx!
np :)
Lunar_Brony: why did she clicked on it lol
Welcome to the herd pony_3546
11,02But yeah, it was a family-friendly convention and having Egoraptor yell 'WELL FUCK YOU' at the top of his lungs didn't go well with Staff >>
Shizuka: idk, i always saw the .mov series and its popularity as a sign that the fandom is able to laugh at itself which is good
Not everyone here a brony
hey pony_3546
Then again I had errors too
pony_3546, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
hey
13that's not fandom laughing at itself
flutterchu: sure why not
13it's fandom taking itself for granted
13and turning into 4chan
NewSuperBronyU: lawl egoraptor did that? i didnt notice that, i just remember max's hardcore trolling
Fluttershy episodes r the best no exceptions
While I love a good Game Grumps at times, Egoraptor needs to tone down
11,02twilight_sprinkle: They were both doing it.
the fandom originates from 4chan
thx Attackwithhugs :3
Welcome to Bronystate pony_3546...the place where you watch movies, ponies and Music you will face ups and down and cheering and killing and PM's and Me
Oh that Egoraptor
pony_3546, you're welcome :3
13DaringDerpy: that it does, it also left 4chan to become better
you have more /b/tards here than you want to know
:)
The fandom DID originate from 4chan, actually
like this place already
Shizuka: idk, depends on how you look at it
it left 4chan because pony wars
NewSuperBronyU: twilight_sprinkle mentioned they were nearly kicked off because Max called Fluttershy something rather vulgar
11,02Honestly, I was shocked that people were just taking it. They were doing it pretty bad that the girl who stood up for herself was probably the better part of it...which MY PHONE RAN OUT OF SPACE WHILE RECORDING IT
i dont give a shit. as long as they keep doing movs and egoraptor keeps doing game grumps and animations im fine
And then they made /mlp/
We really need a Fluttershy emote icon doing the yay pose c:
blachi01 she watches ponies on YouTube mainly because I showed her she chould (we don't get the Hub). She was browsing videos and I was walking by the office when she clicked on it.
J_E_Smith71: i didnt know they were almost kicked off, i only saw the fluttershy bit, didnt know about them getting in trouble
im going for sure add this site to my program :3
Well the fandom was driven from 4chan, though.
Lunar_Brony: dayum lol
NewSuperBronyU: you used your phone?
it was?
who's Max?
dafuq did i just watch?
And only the most depraved parts of the fandom returned to /mlp/
13but hey, if we're okay with crap like .mov becoming the norm, i'll revise my prediction of the fandom's collapse to be sooner rather than later
NewSuperBronyU: well now you have con experience :P
I know, isnt it crazy?
flutterchu: max gilardi
11,02But yeah, they were insulting everyone pretty bad, that it was funny, but when you realize it, they just got away with telling off the fandom and giving the middle finger to every brony there.
flutterchu: hotdiggedydemon
I don't know what you expect, Shizuka. Apllying your own values, expecting your own values, can only fail. The fandom is richer than that
blachi01 you think it's funny? I don't watch the .mov series and I knew the dangers. She is 6 years old!
08,01want to know something cool?
11,02And they were pretty serious about it
oh...um......okay
pony_3546: You can change your name by clicking Refresh on the bottom of the chat and then type in your nickname :3
okay :3
Lunar_Brony: .......lol
08,01ubuntu pc sales last year were greater than apple's computer sales in 2007
yo im back :3
:3
yeah haha
bbuubbi: nice name :D
o.o
xD
thats my name evrywhere :3
bubi XDD
that is kinda cool, and keep in mind that I have no care towards Linux
bbuubbi: cool name :3
even here in this chatroom we have regulars who are cynical beyond good and evil and give the middle finger to everyone every day
straight from my childhood mind xD
but I do loathe Apple technology with a vengeance..
they are part of the fandom
did i miss something
Its like you typed it on a public bus and it kept bumping
-7me gives the middle finger to DaringDerpy
>-7
cashie pls
-/me fil?
>fil
-/me fail?
ITS A NEW COMMAND OK?
WAAAAAAAAAAAA
13DaringDerpy: and again, if that's going to be normal, the fandom will collapse
>fail fail
/me is testing
xD
Oh no!!!
:D
13being a dick to everyone doesn't tend to foster community
The fail has been doubled!
hey i can :D
I don't see the appeal of Apple stuff, it crashes often it hates my games and it won't die!!
im glad BFDIA 4 came out...does anyone want to see?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E174ogB49xs&list=UUeKLuqGciqZZ5RFYk5CbqXg&index=1&feature=plcp
/me Rainboom
/me is wondering how many commands exists
:o
/me likes this
if you can't look past these few people, if you define the whole fandom by these you have conflicts with, then it can only fail for you, Shizuka
/me is going to abuse this command
not for the rest of us
/me is being a faggot by saying everything in the third person
13DaringDerpy: these few people are the public face of the fandom
Shizuka: well theres a point where its too much yes, but sometimes its just joking around. indeed it doesnt foster the community, but its always important to give benefit of the dounbt
not many are eligible if you aren't a mod or aren't in a specific chatroom
/me thinks bbuubbi's plan is a great idea
/me liek le trixie command
And the .MOVs wrap up at the end of the year anyway. Maybe it'll die off when they've stopped making them
DaringDerpy it be wise not to argue with a mod
Shizuka: giving in to public pressure? we didn't get strong by being cowards
Shizuka: because most people understand they were just joking, they arent idiots, they wouldnt legitimately go out and do that
SWAG.MOV VS SEASON 3
/me agrees with Rainboom
/me nods
13so you assume
Shizuka: and if its a joke, then it shouldnt be taken seriously
/me breathes
13see
13i could say
13HEY YOU
13FUCK YOU
Yeah Daylight Savings time! Another hour to waste my life of computer tonight! :D
/me sits down
13and go
;_;
XD
13oh hey it's a joke
I HAT YOU
LOL
:'(
Ponies47, yay \:3/
13doesn't change the fact that i insulted you
;A;
Good example Shizuka
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQtKnDGhxmk seriously, what the fuck is this?
the fandom will stand and fall with the quality of the episodes...everything else...secondary
flame wars just hapened?
13and it doesn't make it retroactively okay
I have a pikachu hat
Shizuka: to be honest that was hilarious
Shizuka: but you didnt
Ponies47, I like DST in the fall.
Shizuka: i dont consider it an insult
Rainboom: oh yeah...well i AM part pikachu
Hey NewSuperBronyU on the Twitter it says you erased the SWAG bit to record more of the panel, so did you get another portion of it?
flutterchu: AWESOME :O
what's going on here? did someone have a DARN DIRTY OPINION again?
Shizuka: AVGN would say that
hey guys
you know those are forbidden here
Hai bbuubbi
11,02J_E_Smith71: I got more of the panel, yes.
any one else watching superbrony64's livestream?
yes`?
bbuubbi: Ping!
Shizuka: ONLY IN CHARACTER THOUGH*
ok...you don't want a reasonable approach...I'm ok with it...
Shizuka: the intentions are whats important,if he didnt mean to insult us, and i believe he didnt because he would have to be mental to go out and do it in public, why would i consider it an insult if i know he didnt mean it
If you really think about it, swearing should be redundant. It's just words; your tone of voice says more about your message than the message itself.
ping sound is ping
/me sees the title
dat ping
NewSuperBronyU: Did you get to meet HotDiggetyDemon? Like talk to him? O.O
13and if he did mean to insult us?
howd u do that?
but...don't play the moral watchdog then...
DaringDerpy: I resent being called cynical beyond good and evil. I am a perfectly healthy level of cynicism, exactly the dosage doctors prescribe in fact.
how you say it is more important than what you say
13and got away with it because he's internet famous?
twilight_sprinkle, remember murder without the intention is still murder.
AVGN: "whoever made this is a C:DK Sucker, Desciption: sucks c:Dk
(ok, manslaughter, close enough)
/me closes out of it
11,02Ponies47: No, but I met him to draw me a sketch of my OC
bbuubbi: Best command is this one:
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 6 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes, 49 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 6 days, 11 hours, 45 minutes, 45 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012 UTC)
Ponies47, http://i.imgur.com/ResZP.jpg best sketch ever.
I remember some brony getting shielded by other bronies because he did something wrong, I think
lol
Shizuka: thats not why i assume hes not lying, if anything, people who would genuinely insult others wouldnt say it out loud, they would think it. famous or not, no sane person would say it at a con
/me bites Jmo
WallDives: thats completely different
Tom forgot about Part 2! :O
oh...now it gets interesting...
Oi, no biting.
WallDives: if you were murdered, you dont have a say in the matter
hey guys, any coding geniuses in here?
WallDives: but you Can choose whether to be sensitive or not
NewSuperBronyU: I talked to him and he drew me a pwetty picture (Which should never be shown in this chat becasue it pissed everyone off (You can see it on my Twitter :3))
i fucked up badly in my code >.>
What prompted this discussion anyways?
Ponies47 replace the Cheetos with a can of Coke and the Triforce with a maple leaf and you got me in a nutshell.
AVGN: ''It fuckin' sucks, it suckin' fucks, it fuckin' blows, it's a piece of shit, and I don't like it''
he still did it. you cant control peoples reactions. that was my point.
NewSuperBronyU: HA! I love the drawing he did of your OC XD
very pooly made, I admit.
does anyone want to see the most realistic drawing ever
what?
poorly^
the?
yes?
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xsZiwTdIfas/T3Cp0y2LL8I/AAAAAAAAKWo/_ARW0cT21uA/s1600/Most_Realistic_Drawing_Ever.jpg
WallDives: indeed, they shouldnt have done it, and i agree it will cause problems for the fandom, but its also the peoples' fault if they took it too seriously
11,02But yeah, I'm sure the EQLA staff are furious about what happened.
flutterchu: wow
and for the record, i dont even like egoraptor
wow
is that a DRWAING?!
13see, you can say that in hindsight
flutterchu: thats a drawing??? holy shit man o_o
Lunar_Brony: XD
13WOW IT WAS SO OBVIOUS HE WAS JOKING
what exactly happened?
NewSuperBronyU: get into MGS mode and spy the staff rage :3
Shizuka: it was kinda obvious from the start though
/me asks again: What exactly prompted this discussion? O.o
Great another debate
11,02I took a picture of staff in the background talking about it
did they look pissed?
13and in hindsigh you can say gee anyone who couldn't immediately tell he was joking is taking everything too seriously, because that's somehow bad
VOTE: Obama VS Romney!
Alright everyone place your bets
VS wins
VS for president
I really hope that the EQLA convention won't be the same as the Everfree convention
Shizuka: taking things too seriously is often bad
^^this
YAY
Shizuka or twilight_sprinkle
Go VS!
13and why is that
Rainboom: I want to mash both over the head with a hammer. That's my vote.
Place your bets
Trotbama vs clopny...hmmmmmm.........ROMNEH
no polotics!!
13why is taking something seriously bad
lols
or
but whatever
Shizuka you can say anything in hindsight, but it almost never makes a difference.
Shizuka: because you could end up doing something you shouldnt have because you assumed someone meant to hurt you
I don't know what's going on, but i'm guessing it's because someone has an opinion
PEDObama VS Clopney :D
i should be sleeping right now D:
or wins
13and when you're wrong?
11,02Problem is, he knew no-one would take anything seriously, so he pretty much did whatever he wanted
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssRh39r3J20&feature=plcp
Shizuka: wrong about what
bbuubbi: what is this sleep that you speak of?
Inb4 Max is banned from future cons
its a state of relaxsation
11,02He even got everyone to salute like a Nazi and shout 'SIEG HEIL' during the comedy pledge.
so we have brony fandom factions now? politics? meh...
cuite refreshing if you ask me :3
NewSuperBronyU: he Did go overboard, i agree, but at the same time people just shouldnt feel to bad about it
SHOYT UP AND LISTEN TO AUTOTUNE PRESIDENTS
NewSuperBronyU: oh god what xd
Slendy's gonna get ya if you sleep ;O
well
bbuubbi: eh never heard of it
NewSuperBronyU i finished it
NewSuperBronyU: But Max was a jerk to us at Canterlot Gardens as well. He wasen't kicked off the stage. He said some pretty mean stuff to us. We weren't upset we were laughing (Even I was).
one sec
slendy only attacks when you are awake
I vote for calm
he is no coward
i dident plan on it eathier so whatever...
Whose this max?
night guys
Hotdiggety?
Vordox: yes
g'night alexxm
13i love that being a jackass is so accepted in society these days
I vote for PONIES
Vordox: Yep
Oh screw him. =P
Stupid dog you make me look bad! BOOGABOOGABOOGA
Shizuka has a point
13i for one welcome the implosion of civilization
Shizuka: if you jsut meant what if im wrong about everything, well thats a possilbility with anything
lololol
I'm still clueless on what is going on. ;_;
so u meen that if i fall asleep, im safe from slendy, or the exact oposite?
Shizuka: Except for the nice part of civilization that's still decent
the world is shit these days Shizuka, people only grow stupider
Let him do what he wants, he's just testing his limits with each video he makes about ponies =P
oaky
00,02?
it's all over
J_E_Smith71: that part exists?
Once the limit is reached...shit'll go down
00,02bbuubbi, do i detect code?
There is your colors Phase4
yes
ohai Phase4
u do
00,02DerpyMuffins, indeed
to be exact its C#
You mind clearing this debate Phase4?
DUBSTEP VS AUTOTUNE
Shizuka: im not saying its a good thing and should be done, i really hate how being a prick is cool nowadays, but trolling just isnt genuine prick..iness
00,02DerpyMuffins, which debate?
flutterchu: they both suck
13which makes it okay?
chavo
The one Shizuka is in
00,02bbuubbi, bug me in pm and i'll try help
Yes Joomay?
Shizuka: yes, because its just for fun and isnt meant as an insult, so why take it as an insult
yeah before I play this Afflict what is it
00,02DerpyMuffins, whats the debate about?
13because it's fun for the people trolling
13it's far from fun for the people being trolled
Vordox: joke's on him, as long as the Jappleack thing is done I'm only going to watch one video of him :D
13but who gives a shit about them
watching presidents game
/me is eating popcorn and drinking some soda while watching the debate
Shizuka: actually again, that only depends on how sensitive youre being about it
Phase4 it started out with .mov
13no see
bbuubbi, do what i do
Shizuka: me and my friends troll each other all the time, we understand it and its somewhat fun at times
13trolling implies that the opposite party does not enjoy it
give up on coding and focus on animation
Shizuka: well there are different kinds of trolling, true
13now we get to change the definition to make sure it stays acceptable
Shizuka: there is trolling that is genuinely trying to insult, but thats not the one im talking about
give up on PMRants and focus on mapmaker42
give up coding?
movin the goalposts and whatnot
hell no
00,02imho trolling is mischief at others expense. like pranks these can be friendly and enjoyed by anyone, or unfriendly and enjoyed only by the troll
never
Phase4: depends on how bad the prank is
trolls are funny. maxmoefoe is funny
Phase4: if its a small silly one, everyone usually just laughs it off
Phase4: your color she is back =D
GET HAPPY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212xU4lK06s
Basically this kid has a baby out of his hands
Vordox: but im never happy..

twilight_sprinkle depends on your defeniton of "bad"
dat
techno
How come it has Vagina in it?
thingy style
00,02twilight_sprinkle, well really big elaborate pranks can also be laughed off, it depends on who's involved and what the prank is
....welp
Happy Techno bbuubbi !
I'm about to go into a movie
Lunar_Brony: bad what, i forgot what i said
Trolling is pretty much enjoyed by someone with a different view of the perspective
BOM BOM BOM BOM!!!! UNTS UNTS UNTS UNTS!
See you guys later
what movie?
bbuubbi: Fine you want more...artistic?
Kay then, back to GW2.
Phase4: that is true, which is why im saying that people should just try to laugh it off
Wreck-it Ralph
nah
im fine with this
/me headbangs
don't think ive seen the preview on it, but hope its good :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw <-- There, happier bbuubbi ?
See yous
:P
13how do you decide what to laugh off
/me hits head in table
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDEk0TVmW0w
13or are you supposed to automatically know
Shizuka: Major population
Shizuka: idk i usually am able to tell
13you are
:o
00,02twilight_sprinkle, no, laugh off ones that you enjoy, quietly ignore the other trolls
Vordox: i cant get my hands in nier :/
see ya
DUBSTEP! :D
flash be crashin' on meh
00,02if no one pays attention they'll get bored
cachi01: In? what?
All I know is out had video game characters in it
anyways
[20:23:40] <twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: if its a small silly one, everyone usually just laughs it off
See ya
wait, wrong one
00,02XD
im getting ready to die of eargasm...
and now I lost the original message!
Vordox: its so hard to find
bbuubbi: Which video? :P
Shizuka: people just dont give the benefit of doubt nowadays anymore
cachi01: Of course, I told you. ><
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw
Vordox: lol
Nier is one of those "Golden Must haves"
You're not getting it easy
Going to bed now night everypony! :)
but now i dident die
low Q is low Q D:
ewwww skrillex
A game that BLOWS everyone mind after it got discontinued
13trust is highly difficult to earn with me
night Rainboom :)
Shizuka: You don't trust me? :(
bbuubbi: I know something that'll make oy ulike Skrillex...
I remember now, I did see a commercial about it on tv
Shizuka: but thats your choice, and its not really huge trust like trusting someone with your keys or something
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEChu3hnJhU here bbuubbi :D
I can't imagine why Shizu >>
the typos make me unable to understand that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnua-yXjPpc
13internet exponentially more so
chat needs more metal
/me throws a block of iron at cachi01
nuff metal?
what commands are aviable?
just wondering?
Just got back no stream?
Shizuka: you dont lose anything by assuming someone is just trolling, its actually healthier to assume its just a joke instead of getting too sad over it
Hello everypony! How are you all tonight?
good, you?
13twilight_sprinkle: one word, politics
Shizuka: So what I do to earn your trust? :(
thx Lunar_Brony now i can craft this metal into a shovel!
13they're just trolling when they burn billions of dollars right?
bbuubbi: I'm doing great!
good :)
Shizuka: not really, more psychology. its just up to every individual how to take it, get angry and sad over it or laugh it off
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHkNl758-YM
13again, you're supposed to automatically know someone's trolling
Shizuka: the government? well no, they cant afford that
As I said, trolling joke/real = General populace that either laugh or shoot the person, Shizuka
13or else you assume everything is a joke
13or everything is real
Shizuka: if you cant know, then just always assume its a troll, its still better than getting angry over it
cachi01: Classic. <3
most of the time, it's simple incompetence
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nba3Tr_GLZU&feature=related
00,02Shizuka, do what i do, take nothing seriously until you have reason to
^
getting angry about anything is immature
clouds the mind
no use in it
release your anger..
13it focuses energy
bbuubbi to a normal user, "/me *message*" to slant your text, "/nick *nickname*" to change your nick, "/join *channel*" to enter a specific channel, ":kickcount *user*" to know how many times the BerryPunch bot kicked that user, and maybe a few more. ":kickcount" only works when BerryPunch is active
which she is!
Is anything on-stream?
13bbuubbi: http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc.html
Shizuka: it costs you the ability to reason
Crono_brony not atm
not worth it
and now have some chiptune :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TANhL8H6Kok
Shizuka: only temporarily, its very unhealthy to constantly be angry
13reason, then focus
Shizuka nuff commands?
Lunar_Brony: Ah, thanks for the info., I like your name, reminds me of mine. X3
zen this nonsense out...
Shizuka: idk, anger doesnt help me think clearly
Debate still going on?
13i'm slow to anger, by the time i am i have gathered more than enough information to deal damage
yep
yes DerpyMuffins , obama is winning!
destructive....and you demand trust?
13no i don't
TL;DR Wht are u guys discussing?
twilight_sprinkle: is he?
I have no idea, Metronome
Metronome: max gilardi acctitude
Eli: i was being silleh D:
13i scarcely trust anyone, least of all myself
13but that's part and parcel of depression
i dont trust anyone i havent known for atleast 5 years
twilight_sprinkle: so he isn't?
You need a hug Shizuka
Eli: ik, i suspect he is tbh
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljtdaprbo41qafrh6.jpg
twilight_sprinkle: i would guess so too
Crono_brony thank you! I actually go by 4 aliases: "Canadian_Brony" and "Lunar_Brony" (my regular nicks), Zombie_Brony (joke for when chat is dead), and Science_Brony (self-explanatory).
Metronome: No clue, I was asking for several minutes before I gave up and went back to GW2 full-time. >.>;
I think I better be silent...I'm too drunk to not put oil into the fire
Shizuka: but depressions int fun, so why keep doing that?
13because it's that easy
Lunar_Brony: god you are complicated...
CriticKitten: max gilardi attitude at EQLA
sarcasm isn't cool
bowties are
cachi01: wat
yes it is
and yay for visible paper lines!!
Shizuka: it's shitty isn't it? even when you know about it, you just can't get out of it
CriticKitten: max gilardi was mean in eqla and now Shizuka and twoiloight_sprunkl are discussing it
Eli no one can call me complicated unless they know me irl.
cashie pls
twoiloight pls
Who the hell is Max Gilardi?
08,01CriticKitten: me
seriously?
xd
wait . . .
Lunar_Brony: :P i didn't say you were complicated. i just find your use of names complicated. i was even to lazy to think of something else than my real name
08,01i have no idea who Max Gilardi is
xd
08,01ah, okay
08,01well, no
Oh, that asshat who makes those shitty .MOV movies?
08,01i'm famous in the fandom in my own right
time to sleep...have fun everypony :P
bye DaringDerpy
and now i can haz food finally
don't take the fandom more seriously than it deserves
CriticKitten: yep. that cool guy that makes those awesome series
Lunar_Brony: My aliases are Cronotrigger148 and crono_brony ( bronystate only) Thing is, everyone thinks my name is related to chrono trigger, but I have never played it. I loved the word "chrono", but despised the "h" in the word. so I mostly put "crono" in most of my aliases...
Okay then. So now I know who he is. Now I guess the followup question is "Why should I care if he was mean on-stage? Just call him an asshat, as I did, and move on."
08,01unfortuantely, i have to take the fandom seriously
Just downloaded Trotmania
Crono_brony: you have no time to write the "h" :P
08,01i run a business involving it
It's actually pretty good
Spell-of-Gaming: cool :) which songs are in it
CriticKitten: like he never was mean, even before the MOVs
Some songs are fanmade and the others are in the show
08,01you'd be surprised how much fandom drama can affect a con
Wacky game jokez 4 kidz is awesome
Just AFKed, Wht are we discussing now?
i made another remix of the cupcakes song
cachi01: and the northern incident
I guess you guys will have to wait till EverFree gets their video of the panel to see what happened, cause Super Brony's not posting it due to the content
anybody else watch the pokemon abriged?
weeping_pegasi82: theres a pokemon abridged?
08,01Mega_Milk: i run Europe's large MLP convention
08,01so in a word, yes
and lots of money
08,01*largest
cachi01: yah I'll post a link
weeping_pegasi82: cool thx :)
08,01aye, loats of work, lots of money involved
08,01Mega_Milk: 700
MadSurge: I dun care when he started being mean, his works are terrible and apparently he's a jerk to boot, so I've no reason to be anything but blunt in calling him an asshat.
Crono_brony I use Canadian_Brony and the like on BronyState only; everywhere else, I'm "Ryanier" with a 3-digit number on the end. I was going to use "Ryanier128" here, but for some odd reason it was taken when I first arrived. In the 7 years I used "Ryaneir", only once has it been taken.
08,01which isn't bronycon size, but we're looking to have 1500 - 2000 next year
lolol
so far away we wait for the daaaaay
/me tries to remember the lyrics
Here, everyone who is not in the chat. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE Have some insanity
/me fails
CriticKitten: like, the Ask Jappleack blog is a nice story, now if only he was like that all the time instead of being/pretending to be a jerk
cachi01: this isn't the first episode but it's one of my favorites http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V0AMrwFNjM&list=SPB332265A0D8A591A&index=13&feature=plpp_video
I wish I could go to a meet-up or convention, but I'm at that age where I can make reasonable plans, but can't execute most of them due to lack of a driver's license.
Metronome: Harrasing?
Phase4
Metronome: nope
no?
Metronome: Asking questions is harrasment?
08,01Eli: BUCK
Metronome: please sir.
Granted, I guess that means I have to be mean to respond to his meanness, but....meh. I'm okay with that. That's how people picture me anyways, so....no point in disappointing.
Metronome: stfu
Sorry TL;DR
08,01Metronome: no-one's harrassing me
Just Assuming Things
Hi Everypony :)
Sry:'(
Metronome: you wanna make it up to me?
weeping_pegasi82: well your wrist smells like shit XDD
http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133944790110.png
did i miss PPPS :(
cachi01: it gets better :D
Metronome: Give me your wubs (>---___---)> Right now...
Vordox: i think it's more because of the U and the K in buck
<(^.^<)
Eli: Maybe, I don't have any hard facts.
Metronome: You are forgiven.
:D
Btw, Wht are we discussing :/
come on equestria daily post my songs
Lunar_Brony: I also use soulshift686, hinari.//, and... well, that's pretty much it.
Eli: No idea what you mena
Vordox: either you're sarcastic (which you shouldn't be on the internet, trust me) or it's better you really don't :)
Anyways, I have a much nicer topic of discussion.
And Buck is highly relate dto ponies

But it's still a Hind Kick movement.
http://www.welovefine.com/3784-rainbow-dash-hoodie-footie-by-underboss.html <---- And this is that topic: Great thing, or the GREATEST thing?
08,01flutterchu: i'm not the leader, no
08,01i'm just a mod and a techie
There should be fonts for different tones of voice. I should be able to say "What a great party. I had so much fun." and type it in "Sarcastica", which is self-explanatory.
weeping_pegasi82: oh god this is awesome xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4HkAM8g7kA&feature=g-vrec
cachi01: ikr
Lunar_Brony: There'a reason >_> and <_< is emotive now

WHAT?!
WHAT DID HE DO!?
Wrek's TOO nice to do anythign stupid
Oh this discussion again.
Vordox: he streamed an episode of Bullshit about porn
Vordox, remember that episode of Bullshit he showed?
Vordox, for streaming Penn and Tellers Bullshit
So Penn and Teller is ...bannable now?
^
Vordox: TLDR Bullshit episode about porn was shown, it violates the rules so he's not allowed to stream for a month
porn is
Ah.
Weird..
Porn is banable
aerials in the sky when you lose small mind you free your life.
The chat wanted the one with porn/Orgasm and shit, and when they get it Wrek gets banned.
Bah
porn is illegal here
along with opinions and individualism
but the internet is for porn, and bronystate is a part of the internet => bronystate is for porn

AJIsAwesome: Except if you use it on someone who was turned to normal by being hit with my frying pan, it makes the person emit lethal doses of methane from their, um, "plot"
You mean it makes them pass gas?
NewSuperBronyU yes?
Well, that's certainly..interesting. :D
AJIsAwesome: Powerfully enough to make their ass literally explode
Normal people in Browniestate?
eddmario: You mean, like farting around as if rocket powered?
wat da hell u on abut ayejay
??
What is it, Jaymoo?
Rex_Mundi: I mean as if a bomb was up their ass and it exploded
I swear things just swoop past your mind.
Is there a stream yet?
Nevermind Ayejay.
no
They don't swoop, Jmo. They go WOOSH! :3
u r still stoopid.
:O
Luckily I hit him on the head, so it won't cause the exploding ass part, but it'll still be lethal to anyone not wearing a gas mask
:<
Luckily NewSuperBronyU is immune to the gas because it's coming from his body
OK bye everypony, I've been up 20h so as much as I'd like to stay, I better go. :P
Bye all

weeping_pegasi82, indeed that is something that was drawn

I'm saving my excitement for when the episode actually airs.
True, it was stupid that Hasbro made us wait for monts T_T
I tend to do that :$
eeyup with a computer mouse
months*
Stary: well atleast your not a communiy fan
Im a little sad that you now need an accout to see images on the MLP Arena. I occasionally browse that forum too see what the old schol fans are up too and what they have/have created. But now I cant see thier images.:(
superretroworld: Lol
You mean an account for free?
superretroworld: The ones that go to the Bronycons?
Polydunami: Yeah, but I dont want to sighn up for a sight i wont be posting much in.
Stary: no communitys a show
Why did we wait for months?
Stary: No, the ones who are fans of the show Community.
Because they're preparing S3, duh.
Anyone here played RE5?

Vordox:
ke
me
it's the boulder one isn't it?
superretroworld: Oh okay, there are so many categories of Bronies that I tend to get confused >_<
weeping_pegasi82: No it's BETTER
Vordox: resident evil 4 and 5 are fun but those games were the ones that sent the story into weird places.

Good guy enderman
Shizuka: Good Guy Enderman
cachi01: XD
Shizuka: Daww. :)
What about THAT video, Cachi01 =3
Stary: i didnt know there were categories
11,02I'm hungry -.-
superretroworld: Yep, I just searched it up
cachi01: ...interesting
superretroworld, there are
superretroworld: dat youtube first comment
superretroworld: Apparently there's the average Pony fan, the Pony Freak, and the one who just has a major obsession with the show called Pony Addicts
d3rb: i guess
:D
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc7bbnrJW61rf5g10o1_500.gif
cachi01: Best plan ever right? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSMx4yXJu2w
my flash hiccuped
Stary: im the average pony fan, what about you?
Vordox: eeyup :D
superretroworld: of what vid?
Polydunami: Cute :3
superretroworld: You just pinged youself. :3
Unnervingly so :S
superretroworld: Average
AJIsAwesome: :D
cachi01: of what vid?
superretroworld: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSMx4yXJu2w
I draw ponies a lot but for some reason I'm drawing a pikachu with a cyborg arm...
d3rb: Try being an anime or furry fan. Those fandoms get a few special kind of weird people mixed in with the normals that make you question your sanity.
otakus are cool
true Rex_Mundi, it just doesnt help that at its core, this is a kids show
d3rb: little girls?
little girls*
i never said that, i said kids show
I think it's a family show
little girls*
my 5 year old nephew like mlp
superretroworld: Huh, I just discovered other types of bronies O_O
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_magkuiw12C1ry10fwo1_500.gif This is just awesome :D
weeping_pegasi82: It's more of a family show than a show for girls, IMO.
^ actually thats probably more accurate than what i said
Stary: there is the cloppers, but those dont count
my 2 year old brother likes the show so much he sings a long with the theme song (he only says pony and the aaaaahhs but still)
I don't care if you fap to cartoons
o_O
wat.
I dont think this fandom has had the "pleasure" of having a person like 'Tumbles the stair dragon'... yet.:D
I don't need to know, personally :S
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
superretroworld: Yea, theres the normal bronies, fanfiction writer bronies, creepy bronies, sick-minded bronies (otherwise known as cloppers but they don' t count as you said) and then theres the bronies who imply MLP to their life o-o
Pondoo
then theres jmo
ikr?
i liek r34
Stary: where do the artistic bronies fit in?
cachi01: o.O
Panda: Well... some of us have interestests that not all bronies have.
cachi01, me too, i love skylines gtr especially
Stary: yay im a sick minded brony
Rex_Mundi, im sorry?
d3rb: what u did there i see
weeping_pegasi82: Probably in the Awesome, Average Bronies category
:3
weeping_pegasi82: There's like an entire discussion of it on Youtube O_O
Stary what of the artistic ones who also produce risque and suggestive content.
I probobly am an adverage brony most of the time, but a MLP fanatic some of the time.
whoa
how long has it been without a stream? wasn't really keeping track
Panda: I'm guessing sick-minded, it depends... If it's mature- sexual content then yeah XD
Stary, I see...
Panda: But if it's average then your in the awesome category
Ok.
Yeah I know... Weird O_O
Stary: so wrek is sick minded?
Why are we judging each other?
^
^^
^^^
^^^^
v
^^^^^
I have no idea... I just searched up a list of different types of Broneis so yeah...
dammit cachi01
theres a list of different types of bronies?
Yeah
who dafuq came up with that?
It's messed up
Stary, you shouldnt make generalizations like that.
It's like a list of the different flavours of vanilla :S
A list... Wat?
Panda: Yeah I know, I just got kinda curious and randomly saw it
Polydunami: anyway they all taste delicious and almost the same
i dont think its so much an actaul list but put bronies into groups
Yeesh, can't we just all get along? :(
d3rb: Yeah, it's not actual, just kinda what the person thinks
Stary, why would you generalize them in the first place. I honestly done see the point.
Agreed, Polydunami.
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
???
Why did you slap me, Panda?
AJIsAwesome ^^ because, pponies
:D
Panda: I don't either o_O, lists are made for other things

Polydunami: They are called fans that dont know self controll. Super fans are only weirdos if they can contain themselves. Cloppers are only sick-minded' if its the only thing they care about. Anime fans are otakus only if they cant operate like human beings, the list goes on.

I wonder what would happen if we kicked everyone and only the people who really talked in chat a lot would come back. :D
*facehoof*
I'm talking I tend to say what im typing while i'm typing it. And i tend to read out too
08,01AJIsAwesome: we can try

Some people have plugins that make them come back when they're kicked, though
Huh
Maybe I am
Maybe I'm not
Yeah... no, that's taken care of, Spell-of-Gaming
thelonepony: VVVVUUUUUULLLPIIIXX
Some one link a cute video
i dont see the point of kicking inactive, theyre not taking up space
i admit, i lurk alot in here
I lurk somewhat as well...
lurk ?
But then I stick around with nothing to say otherwise :P
i get easily distracted from chat, need a bigger monitor
I lurk only when I have no idea what is being talked about
I don't mind people being inactive, it just would be interesting seeing how many people would log back in manually if they were kicked. :D

00,10arcams razor DaringDerpy

Tsundere
00,10never heard it stated that way
Sumica: Tsundere.
Tsundere or Tsunderu
/me crawls onto TheRandomkid321's lap
...
00,10always heard it as stated, the simple solution is the right one
SHE'S DEAD!
it means the solution with the least assumptions if probably the right one
the really bad guy
00,10so raigun or more index?
We got a badass over here!
-if +is
well hes fucked
Uhh... more index

Wrek: <.< Thought you were done
Vordox, I've never unsync in my life with my streaming
05done?
and I've used Livestream for 2 years
Wrek: With Skyrim
if you unsync it's YOUR problem
05as did I
CrimsonPhoenix: You tried to stream a non live stream?
05but ik eep modding it
CrimsonPhoenix: To about 200 people?
Wrek: That swam trek. :P
I believe we have a different definition of un-sync
I was thinking of audio video unsync
you're thinking of connection speed
I'm talking about viewing the same thing
As I recall that I talke about a certain unsycn for EACH specific person ehre
Not Unsync as audio or visual
But a completely different view
Unsync?
You mean ping, right?
some people might take time to throw their content mostly due to connection speed
...
Vordox: Doesn't refreshing the stream solve that problem?
EXACTLY what Spell-of-Gaming said
PING
Gold_Demona: No, it'll restart your Livestream to the latest one in the playlist
Gold_Demona, temporarily
Wrek 3x station cash today depending on what amount you pay for for PS2
If you just embed a playlist, everyone going to be at different points in it.
it'll go back to that DELAY
Is the point he's trying to make.
ah
Wrek For in PS2*
Ping is the miliseconds of what travels to you, IIRC
Spell-of-Gaming: Ping is the response
Not the send
Ping = Sends a ping, and wait for it to come back
The travel back and forth = Ping MS
Yeah, I just got a bit confused
Livestream only lets you play previous steraming sessions I think
you can add youtube videos
YOU DARE CALL A MOD WRONG
HERETIC
in a studio
/me snores in his dream.
moorniing Jmo
Vordox, yes cause I have 2 years experiance
I called a mod nerd once, nothing happened
Why would you scream morning at me
It's neither morning for either of us.
cuuuuz Ii..
But can you lock everyone to the same point in the video?
I even remember the time when Livestream was called Mogulus
well..yeah
>_>
CrimsonPhoenix: you old
Becuase if they can just change what's playing on their stream, then it's kind of pointless
what will what now?
You're in control
you choose your video
CrimsonPhoenix: Noone is in control
That's the thing =P
Does it stop them from dragging the buffer bar along though?
Vordox, you're wrong
you can control what video can be displayed
I've been wrong before. :P So go ahead.
in a studio
Explain, cause I have no idea about this
Except the things I got told by other
What are you guys taalking about?
and you can even let the studio do it itself
CrimsonPhoenix: So like an radio station?
Cause that's what we need
can you use synch tube?
exactly
or TV station
THOUGH
I must say
Not sure if we can embed a synctube
that was 1 or 2 years ago
there has to be a way
synchtube works on embedding and controlling youtube, so ne we can't
maybe livestream became more jewish now and need to be paid
BIGOTRY DETECTED
activate turn back to
Please don't make comments like that. :/
but still I used livesstream as an example
CrimsonPhoenix: This is intruiging...
Maybe we could use it
If what tou say is true that is
Tell Phase or Ghosties about this
though another problem with livestream
when you start a channel you have only 50 viewers limit
to remove that
you need to verify your channel
We do have some verified channels
and OH GOSH is that annoying
If you have time that is
I'll look into it
This could help save time for Phase especially
TO CELEBRATE THIS OCCASION
Of a possible good future

HAVE SOME HEART
Vordox, http://www.livestream.com/studio/
this is where mods go to put in videos and CUE them
Don't talk to me about it :P
So what you guys are trying is--playlists and changing embeds?
Vivix: When noone is streaming, there'll be a playlist playing
Ooooh~~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUMcA--ejOc <3
That almost spells Sumica...
hehe
/me wanna hijack the stream and play games on it...
exposure for playing games on backlog
Go
Is there an auto-switch for the premiere? So people don't have to refresh to change embed?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ancJUTA94eY&feature=bf_next&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&shuffle=345985 And some Ponies:P
:$ hi
Hello everypony........
:(.........i've been better
Hi Dark92Enigma :3
I'm watching Counter-Strike!
IFDreebs: How was it? what's it about again?
Counter-Strike is a competitive, team based FPS shooter produced by Valve
o_O
Counter-Strike 1.6 is legendary for being one of the longest-running formal E-Sports titles ever.
Oh CS, how grand of a game you are.
IFDreebs: Yeaaah...so? =P
05still nto a fun game :P
It's thanks to them our market is why it's like this now...
>.>
in the latest iteration of the title, CS: Global Offensive
05i prefer starcraft as an Esport
what are you going to do when the season premieres?
05more tactics
05more involving
I'm going to pony pony
IFDreebs: Oh......i think i've seen it before
Because Pony should pony pony
IFDreebs: with THE HULKSTER as main guest
you should always pony
(host?
always
!
SOMEONE FOUND A WAY TO LOOP YOUTUBE VIDEOS AGAIN
GASP
yeah, host
Oh boy. Time to loop Gypsy Bard again
:O GAAAAAAAAAAAAASP
/me whistles the song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLJuuHqKCCc
This video loops
Why doesn't youtube just implement looping as a feature?
Without the use of any other tool
You need to have comments enabled
Or annotions
Whatever ou call it
If you look top left before it loops
Yeah
The little timer thing comes up
It has something to do with a delayer
I know
But this means..
.ANOTHER MONTH OF LOOPING VIDEOS
Whooo
Speaking about videos...
Anyone here a Derpy fan?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_8RW6qX1Q :P
Hi!
Wow vordox you've been talking a lot!
Hey Alchemist :)
I see I joined at a downtime.
Socks: Fine I'll shut up then
LP
*:P
allo Alchemist
Which mod do I have to ask if a movie is eligible for bmn?
ONE LAST VIDEO ABOUT DERPY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
Hi Deacon !
Alchemist: You send it in via Newsletter
That survey is the movie ltotery
how've you been Alchemist
Alchemist I think go up to either one of them
Okay...
Last one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1cdV4j1Gi0
:P
BYE
/me goes lurk
Vordox: I know that but they excluded one of my coices before and I would like to know if I can even enter it as a choice.
00,02XD
yup, 6 in 10, always works
Alchemist: Think...you know...commonly.
Opening youtube with HTML5 gives me 3 GET errors, Uncaught TypeError and a Resource warning, and a black screen.
And lawl at you too Phase4 =P
00,02Vordox, BerryPunch dislikes your lurking
I think Chrome broke youtube
My timing on my kicks is a mastery in itself
Phase4: Clearly.
>What about the? bubble wrap? Everyone loves bubble wrap!
00,02Vivix, TypeError in javascript. one of the most anoying kinds of errors
THOSE TIME CONSUMMING BUBBLE WRAP
Yeahh~~
It's strange though, html5 youtube no longer works in chrome at all for me- probably beta update
Seriously those bubble wrap are like demons
flash palyer works, but nothing else. Have to use another browser
the moment you see one, it gives you that urge to pop a bubble
00,02i wish firefox suported h264
EVERYTIME
You think they'll standardize that too eventually?
00,02or at least had the ability to be extended to suport h264
00,02Vivix, i hope they standardize ogv simply because the mpeg consortium does not deserve any of the money it makes
MOAR DERPY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o
MWHAUHAUAH
Phase4, it'll do that at the version 16.0
00,02but in reality thats probably not going to happen
Hehe, mpeg is getting rich- yeah
Fraunhofer makes millions on mp3 licenses
CrimsonPhoenix: http://derpiboo.ru/129953
See Luna knows what I'm talking about
Awww Spell-of-Gaming
00,02Vivix, i wonder... flash has a licence for h264 right?
If one see a Bubble wrap, they shall not see the day
tru fact
hmm- not sure, they can process it in Adobe?
I mean if Adobe Flash can export or import h264/MP4 stuff, they have to have the license
Such a nerd combo Vivix/Phase
:P
/me frutilessly slaps Jmo
Your goaticorns will pay that.
Noo!
/me is quiet and nice and obedient
AND FINAL DERPY VID
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwObcjGCVA
:D
No, she's not dead. I have the original episode still on my HD
00,02Vivix, the licencing terms for h264 do not actually state the restrictions of the licence
Tervicz: The video is awesome still :P
00,02Vivix, going by this anyway http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Documents/AVC_TermsSummary.pdf
Okay- reason for unstandard in video tag is because- Mozilla and Opera believes that HTML5 should be patent free- whilst Chrome, Apple and apparently MS adopted H264
00,02which is a pricing guide more than a licence
00,02Vivix, chrome suports both, ms suports only h264
yyeah
test
Hm- I'm guessing then that the company that maintains or creates the browsers are the ones who pay this-
00,02i think apple suports both also
00,02infact is ms causing problems
00,02as usual
Safari only has MP4 according to the list here-
Chrome supports WebM, MP4 and Ogg, so it's the only one on the list that supports everything
Good afternoon everyone :)
hello Everypony ^^

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYET93z5edk&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=2 HAVE SOME AIR COBAT
Alchemist: never thought a movie with such a premise would be so BORING, right?
it was stupid, nevermind boring
Alchemist: the ten thousand feet leap was the only worthwile scene :D
MadSurge: and the glowing sex
Alchemist: luckily 12 Angry Men was much better than I expected
you haven't seen it before? Yeah, it is a great movie.
There is another movie which is dialoge driven and its pretty cool. Its "The man from earth".
Does anyone have the lottery results from Friday?
many others downrated it
Alchemist: we don't get to see those movies here, unless it's at like 3 am in obscure movies programs
MadSurge: ummm, torrent?
So yeah
What movie we talkin' about?
Moonstuck is over
Alchemist: I didn't even know of its existence
.....SLICE OF LIFE HERE I COME
Gold_Demona: 12 angry men
ah
Never seen it. :P
that was a good movie
Hey Alchemist LET'S DO SCIENCE
Lottery results anyone?
I'll grab the vials you get the liquid
We must make it glow
RosePetal, How to train your dragon, suited for success, Jetson movie, Ticket Master
ok. thanks.
CrimsonPhoenix: okay, what your plan? Do you want to do fluorescence or phosphorescence?
Gold_Demona: a juror manages to turn all the others to a verdict of reasonable doubt through nothing but logic and pointing out flaws in the case
I don't know just make it glow
MadSurge: Ooh!
Gold_Demona: and one of the jurors is the original Piglet voice :D
MadSurge: Heh!
CrimsonPhoenix: I recommend this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tItOOpyJP5k (I also love that guy's channel)
Alchemist, I was just fooling around by how retard the movie was
I know :)
00,02Thank god for file versioning
00,02almost broke bronystate
00,02i meen... nothing has gone wrong, everything is fine. things are all fine

Hehe, that would suck
You scare me Phase.
