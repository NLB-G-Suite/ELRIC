Hey Everypony!! :)
there are colts? I thought this was a mare's show
So...who's streaming?
Oh >.<
Some websites can do that
latas
laters hoo-- oh
13this is mostly just a proof of concept
13going to need to find a buildcraft solution that doesn't overflow pipes
msut be, seeing as the average plush is around $50-100
13since redpower isn't out yer
13awful efficient though
oh, neat
they werent the best but hey at least it was ok
is there going to be a PPPS today?
13for every ore that goes in the left chest
13so instead of ore > furnace > ingot, i get ore > macerator > furnace > 2x ingot
nice
PPPS?
oh the podcasdy
dunno
oops
13only problem is the macerator can only really process one stack, the furnace can process two
sorry bout that, accidentally closed this tab
lol
13if the pipes try to push more in, it overflows and they pop out
13need to find a way to fix that, not sure how with just buildcraft
13redpower's pipes let the items bounce back and forth until they find somewhere to land
13but redpower isn't ready yet
make their travel longer ?
o.o;;
I'm guessing you can't split the pipes into 2 paths
http://i.imgur.com/OhyOe.gif
13but would be more efficient to not pull the ore until it's needed
13not sure if that can be done with buildcraft alone
13have to read up more
http://i.imgur.com/swPpI.jpg
you can pipe out the overflowing ones from the bottom of the macerator and loop it back until theres room
13anyhoof
13oh is that the trick
13would still rather it not try to pull from the chest until the macerator needs ore
http://imgur.com/aIiKp
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/#f/8373/
ok
that's buildcraft for ya

13and turning into 4chan
Fluttershy episodes r the best no exceptions
11,02twilight_sprinkle: They were both doing it.
the fandom originates from 4chan
Oh that Egoraptor
you have more /b/tards here than you want to know
:)
The fandom DID originate from 4chan, actually
like this place already
it left 4chan because pony wars
And then they made /mlp/
Well the fandom was driven from 4chan, though.
it was?
And only the most depraved parts of the fandom returned to /mlp/
13but hey, if we're okay with crap like .mov becoming the norm, i'll revise my prediction of the fandom's collapse to be sooner rather than later
I know, isnt it crazy?
08,01want to know something cool?
oh...um......okay
hi Saturn. Shoot
okay :3
13Saturn: ice

/me likes this

13DaringDerpy: these few people are the public face of the fandom
not many are eligible if you aren't a mod or aren't in a specific chatroom
/me thinks bbuubbi's plan is a great idea
And the .MOVs wrap up at the end of the year anyway. Maybe it'll die off when they've stopped making them
/me nods
13so you assume
/me breathes
13see
13i could say
13HEY YOU

13oh hey it's a joke
I HAT YOU
LOL
:'(
13doesn't change the fact that i insulted you
;A;
13and it doesn't make it retroactively okay
what's going on here? did someone have a DARN DIRTY OPINION again?
hey guys

11,02J_E_Smith71: I got more of the panel, yes.

13and why is that
no polotics!!
13why is taking something seriously bad
lols
or
but whatever
I don't know what's going on, but i'm guessing it's because someone has an opinion

05eugh
05aaand ghome from vacation
05i brought fluuu
http://i.imgur.com/twNtf.png
05just went to my aunt for a week
Hi everyone
Yep? <:
It just shows the last thing before they stopped streaming
Nono
Ahh
That
11,01The pony episode playlist?
Soon™
Pony related
11,01Oh.
Livestream does that
Similar to that livestream recording of Earthbound.
Due to how it's different for each person
Would cauase a unsync
an*
cause*
as in the site
and how it has autoplay
k :p
and do you know how that autoplay works?
not unsync
05time to completly reinstall skyrim
05done?
and I've used Livestream for 2 years
05as did I
05but ik eep modding it
I believe we have a different definition of un-sync
you're thinking of connection speed
I'm talking about viewing the same thing
As I recall that I talke about a certain unsycn for EACH specific person ehre
But a completely different view
Unsync?
You mean ping, right?
some people might take time to throw their content mostly due to connection speed
...
PING
it'll go back to that DELAY
Is the point he's trying to make.
Not the send
Ping = Sends a ping, and wait for it to come back
The travel back and forth = Ping MS
Livestream only lets you play previous steraming sessions I think
YOU DARE CALL A MOD WRONG
HERETIC
in a studio
/me snores in his dream.
I called a mod nerd once, nothing happened
cuuuuz Ii..
I even remember the time when Livestream was called Mogulus
well..yeah
>_>
Becuase if they can just change what's playing on their stream, then it's kind of pointless
You're in control
That's the thing =P
Does it stop them from dragging the buffer bar along though?
in a studio
Explain, cause I have no idea about this
Except the things I got told by other
and you can even let the studio do it itself
can you use synch tube?
exactly
or TV station
THOUGH
I must say
that was 1 or 2 years ago
there has to be a way
maybe livestream became more jewish now and need to be paid
BIGOTRY DETECTED
Please don't make comments like that. :/
but still I used livesstream as an example
Maybe we could use it
though another problem with livestream
when you start a channel you have only 50 viewers limit
to remove that
We do have some verified channels
and OH GOSH is that annoying
If you have time that is
I'll look into it
TO CELEBRATE THIS OCCASION
Of a possible good future
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxnGaURm3B8
HAVE SOME HEART
Don't talk to me about it :P
Ooooh~~
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUMcA--ejOc <3
hehe
/me wanna hijack the stream and play games on it...
exposure for playing games on backlog

Hello everypony........
I'm watching Counter-Strike!
Counter-Strike is a competitive, team based FPS shooter produced by Valve
o_O
Counter-Strike 1.6 is legendary for being one of the longest-running formal E-Sports titles ever.
It's thanks to them our market is why it's like this now...
>.>
05i prefer starcraft as an Esport
05more tactics
05more involving
I'm going to pony pony
Because Pony should pony pony
you should always pony
(host?
always
!
GASP
yeah, host
Oh boy. Time to loop Gypsy Bard again
:O GAAAAAAAAAAAAASP
/me whistles the song
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLJuuHqKCCc
Without the use of any other tool
You need to have comments enabled
Or annotions
Whatever ou call it
If you look top left before it loops
Yeah
It has something to do with a delayer
I know
But this means..
.ANOTHER MONTH OF LOOPING VIDEOS
Whooo
Speaking about videos...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T_8RW6qX1Q :P
Hi!
I see I joined at a downtime.

*:P
Which mod do I have to ask if a movie is eligible for bmn?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-_HeVNYOk
That survey is the movie ltotery
Okay...
Last one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1cdV4j1Gi0
:P
BYE
/me goes lurk
00,02XD
yup, 6 in 10, always works
My timing on my kicks is a mastery in itself
00,02Vivix, TypeError in javascript. one of the most anoying kinds of errors
Yeahh~~
EVERYTIME
You think they'll standardize that too eventually?
00,02or at least had the ability to be extended to suport h264
00,02Vivix, i hope they standardize ogv simply because the mpeg consortium does not deserve any of the money it makes
MOAR DERPY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o
MWHAUHAUAH
00,02but in reality thats probably not going to happen
Hehe, mpeg is getting rich- yeah
Fraunhofer makes millions on mp3 licenses
tru fact
Such a nerd combo Vivix/Phase
:P
Noo!
/me is quiet and nice and obedient
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gwObcjGCVA
:D
00,02Vivix, the licencing terms for h264 do not actually state the restrictions of the licence
00,02Vivix, going by this anyway http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Documents/AVC_TermsSummary.pdf
00,02which is a pricing guide more than a licence
yyeah
00,02i think apple suports both also
00,02infact is ms causing problems
00,02as usual
Safari only has MP4 according to the list here-
