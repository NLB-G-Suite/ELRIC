9guys, we'll get the lottery running in a few
9in the meantime
4Oh dari set up a bot to produce new EQD updates? Interesting
Any Studio Ghibli movie would be absolutely Fantastic
Tron Legacy for the A movie, Alone in the Dark for the B movie
oh no
PREPARE EVERYBRONY!!!
I just missed it didn't I?
inb4flood
Suddenly, talking!
Dari has become a Robot?!?! PANIC!!!
HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN
No. No tron.
So how about that Counter-Strike.
I vote for Tokyo Zombie
con aaaaaaaair
Whoa.
Beer for my horses
FOR THE EPICNESS THAT IS THE BRONY MOVIE NIGHT LOTTERY
>.>
Blazing Saddles!
Also,
When's the next show/movie?
Tron legacy? sounds good. Daft punk's derezzed ftw
WICKER MAN
dari told me
GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE
Huh, not too much flood. Cool.
I need to take a second look at my IRC bot
A Man from Nowhere is pretty epic
DAMMIT DARI
LOTTERY SCHEDULE SLIP
WOO MUSIC IS STILL HERE
I am split between Castle in the sky and howl's moving castle
Fantasia!
Can we have back to the future week after next, I am not here next week
How about "Birdemic" for the B movie? That movie is hilariously awful
Forget everything else, WALL-E
Hmm
Once again, some who didn't know he was in the lottery wins the A B movies.
5wait, can anon be in the lottery? (colored for importance)
So many choices
heh
If someone gets chosen to do a movie, is said person responsible for setting it up come Friday and Saturday?
animal farm
GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE GUYS
Tyranico: Hence, I'll be going with Grave of the Fireflies.
Wicker Man's Already reserved for something else
REDCLIFF
Kill Bill?
Mods said nope on wicker man
Do we only watch PG-13 or lower movies here?
basically, he banned everyone from entering this room, then put exemptions on us
Wicker man is reserved for a special occasion
THE ROOM, aka the worst movie ever
Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE
trigun?
yes, and no colors
wait, so I didn't miss it?
4Yes, as long as you are here in the chat then you can be entered
what exactly defines a B-movie?
CLOOOOWNS
THE ROOM OH YES
The room has already been shown
13It makes me think I'm wasting electricity .w.
@mib_h2zwz3 probably, and colours are just for mods.
I think Blazing Saddles would be a good choice. they are apparently a lot of references to that movie in mlp
R movies have been on before
We already did the Room.
As far as I know, any rating goes, Anonoma
Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
IT by stephen king
wooooohooooo!
0woot
13heck, I even turn the monitor off whenever I go afk LOL
who said the room
anon_h2zwz3 yes, you're on the list, just remember your name.
Aw, CUD
Soooo... Lottery time?
TRADE HATS FOR GAMES ~ Valve
I MISSED THE ROOOM?
Little Shop of Horrors would be nice!
Except perhaps NC-17
awww
Whoever said something about me being a murderer because of my name... lol
eat911: Yes, yes there are.
0how about fight club?
BIRDEMIC
B movie = low budget, so bad it's good and corny acting
So many people want to choose Studio Ghibli movies. It just makes me happy. ^_^
Oklahoma
Blazzing Saddles is a great choice
Sup bros, what did I miss?
Hi and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after over9000 years in development i hope its been worthe the wait
Well, i have still 24 April Foals story to read up.
The Room would be great
Or Camelot
Hat Fortress 2 is the best hat simulator
So, No The Serbian Movie?
0oh, ok. Did that count as my second warning?... :/ aww
I can't wait.
thankyou derp
8anon: in the future, just PM either me or ghosties if you have questions instead of using colors
I just learned about Brony Movie Night halfway through "The Island Earth"
Not the lottery, ChaoMing. :D
B movies must be either, bad, cheesy, bad box office profit
I have a list of movies.
:0
Seriously. Mindgame or Stalker.
we already watched the room
I'm still going with anything tron related
0fight club!
0Blazzing Saddles would be perfect for a movie
Ghosties If someone gets chosen to do a movie, is said person responsible for setting it up come Friday and Saturday?
Any Mel Brooks movie is awesome, though.
do NOT discuss anything RELATED to that horrible fanfic that is the worst thing ever
Would b-movie also be considered critical success, commercial failure?
6well you can turn of the monitor if you want
Did ya guys do Bladerunner or Escape from New York
4@Cobalt: A "B/cult" film would have to fit in with the four guidelines: art house, cheap, cult status, just a bad film all around
B movie? Buckaroo Banzai
I would also vote for Blazzing Saddles
Hi, and welcome to Team Fortress 2 after 9 years in developement, hopefully it will be worth the wait.
6off
worth the weight
LABYRINTH
6I've heard it's actually better to leave desktop towers on lol
9okay gents
I vote for Team Fortress 2
Twilight would be a perfect B-Movie.
0Blazzng Saddles is easily a Cult Status
:P
MEL BROOKS OR STUDIO GHIBLI WILL BE EXCELLENT CHOISES
Can I ask a question
4No, RanYakumo, the mods get the movies
6dun remember where I heard that
TWILIGHT LMAO
If I was a mod, I'd say No to the Serbian Movie
all of a sudden, music
Okay.
Team Fortress 2 would be an incredibly boring movie
is iron giant a b film?
Thanks.
A good example for a B movie would be The Room and Machete
needs inception music
Darm it apple bloom and your TF2
thats bIG o
This music is familiar
@mib_7ogy4m haha noooooooooooooo
*crosses fingers that blazing saddles gets picked as A movie*
Portal the Movie?
Indeed.
Twilight? WTF?
oh yes Twilight would be perfect for a B movie
Love that Big O showtime
8Jon: nope
No waaaay, Jon D:
Dat Zelda (I think)
I am going to burn down your house with lemons, anon, if you choose Twilight
0the little engin that could
I be 'round here btw.
What about the newer Death Race?
Sounds like Super Mario Galaxy
Would Young Frankestein work for a B movie?
Team Fortress 2 would be an amazing movie
0fight club!
Twilight is a B movie
Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
Just not wantin' t' be kick'd
combustiblelemons that was my choice until after it came on tv the other day
No Twilight, please dear god
Big O Noir/Giant Robots
i would love iron giant
What is this music from?
already watched young frankenstein
Naw, not happy enough for SMG
true
Banned all users except for us? Neat
:O
>>
Blazing saddles, definitely
Would machete count as a "b" movie?
Oh yes. Big O
Young Frankenstein was already done
tf2 the movie
not twilight
Darf14 Another good example would probably be A Serbian Film, but anyone who wants to watch that here is just a plain out sadist.
We already saw Young Frankenstein too lol
Is Scott Pilgrim going to be played tonight???
Are you or are you not going to stay for brunch
THE PYRO IS REVEALED
0indpendence day
Kingdom hearts would be the greatest movie in existence
AS
HELL NO, young frankenstain would not be a B movie
A
eeeeeeeeyup
I vote Sharktopus for B movie
It's not Galaxy, but it definitely has a Galaxy-ish vibe
ahh damn it dashite >.<
I would guess Twilight would have some hilarity potential
Big O has some good music
Flergerndargeep
A movie choices: Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Battle Royale, Donnie Darko
NeedsMorePony, that'd be epic
201 bronies
Damn. Missed it.
Independence Day already happened
I NEED MY CUTIE MARK GIVE ME MY CUTIE MARRRRK!!!!!
I would love a MLP:FiM movie! If only they had ine.
Honeydew: Yes.
I second Sharktopus
Who here would watch a God of War movie?
Btw, this music makes me want to play SSBB
Can't wait for Scott Pilgrim. Haven't seen it before.
a
is The Boondock Saints a B or A movie?
9damn it is PK here
SMG2 = one of the best game soundtracks ever
wold wrath of kahn be a B movie?
we're watching scott pilgrim after the lottery
FIGHT CLUB. Though that might be a bit much...
Every movie would be so much better if Rex Reason were in them
How about the original MLP movie? LOL
THE GOONIES
God this music is awesome.
We've already watched young Frankenstien
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MY CUTIE MARK!!!!!!
BATTLE ROYALE, WANT!
We totally need some weird Sci Fi channel original movies
Saving Private Ryan?
A movie choice: Casablanca
Okay, I'm on lunch for a half an hour and there's no movie, what's going on?
if not then ace ventura pet detective would be a good pick
FIM THE MOVIE!!!
huh, I just got kicked out...
@ghostyTrickster HECK yes
GOOOOOOOONIES
0There was a MLP movie in 1986
OH THE GOONIES OF COURSE!
STALKER!?
Saving Private Rarity
13Well I guess I can leave it on overnight just this once :P
Would Death Race count as an A movie or a B movie?
No one dare to say Wrath of Khan is B
No, there is no PK in here.
THE GOONIES FUCK YEAH
Technical Difficulties, CituitMane
I still throw my vote in for "Birdemic"
GOOD BURGER
Nintendo doesn't always do orchestrated soundtracks
13it's for Touhou
We already watched the original MLP movie.
13so <3
0lossthief agreed! fight club
Have we watched Casablanca yet?
THE GOONIES
Saving Private Rarity
lootery
But when they do, they're amazing
How about Pulp Fiction everypony?
I f-ing love Wrath of Khan
8DCD, can you join mod chat?
oooh
I agree with Birdemic
Death Race would be B I believe
0GOOD BURGER!
@RanYakumo A Serbian Film huh? I must watch it since its bad!!!!!
Sloth is the greatest character of all time
seriously we need to watch con air
Goonies, hell yeah!
YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO THE GOONIES
Nintendo does so do orchsrated soundtracks
welcome to good burger can i take your order?
@Dave_BroZilla EXACTLY
Beer for my horses
Saving Private Rarity?
0GOONIES
Would "The Wizard" be a B movie?
Hmm, kinda boo. Means I might catch some of it when I get off work in a few hours
the 1982 conan

Darf14 You might want to look up the Wikipedia plot first.
Can't wait for Scott Pilgrim.

Scott should've been with Knives in this movie
Scott comes back as an evil ex.
But then Scott found ponies
so what happens when she dates another?
Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned not to be a dick. People actually like you then.
So he dumbed Knives

the fuck?
and stuff... and just
does her have to fight scot?

9>we're watching ponies right after this
Didn't see this coming
4It should have been ScottxKim or ScottxKnives. Really, ANYTHING other than ScottxRamona is better than ScottxRamona. Well, except for ScottxEnvy
yeah i know
Lies!
...dude you just killed like 500 people
Knives totally hookes up with nega Scott
Knives is cute in that kid-sister kind of way but Knives is a real woman

Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that if you scratch... don't sniff.
FRIENDSHIP.
RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the alternate ending, Scott ends with Knives and Ramona walks off to the horizon on her own
Nah, you really think Knives would want to date the guy that cheated on her?
Lies, ScottxRamona is best
FUCK YEAH SCOTTXKIM

And Knives is now the most mature person in the movie
Knives is too nice for that douche
Knives X Kim
Ghosties I think ScottxEnvy in the comics would've been good
Ghosties: What about ScottXNega-Scott?
Dear Twilight, Don't write to me again or I will cut you Sincerely, Princess Celestia
I'll be fine, Nega Scott seems like a cool guy.
Ciao, Knives
scott x ramon is awesone
Today I learned that I can be a total jerk to someone who's obsessed with me, but she'll understand because she's actually nice.
I'm so glad they decided not to go with the Knives ending

Spike doesn't realize how lucky he is- I certainly don't get to watch the chick I like parade around naked (with her friend) all day
Child Labor.
NOM
they're finding remnants of a fashion burial ground
i find it difficult to watch the show and chat at the same time
they're like jolly ranchers
Just sayin, but Spike is whipped
NOM NOM NOM
0ill eat gems i guess
4I swear, this sounds like Kingdom Hearts Twilight Town music
/me raises the people's eyebrow at Ghosties.
6How are gems that close to the surface and no one has found them?
Shoveltail
spike has the weirdest boner
Those are some nice gems you have
weirdest boner
Dumb Middle Eastern country
That tail is not anatomically correct
NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
0Oh my
Spike is so whipped they bottle him and spray him on sundaes
Magic
Pink Rupees in my zelda game?
Magic
jackin off
It would be a shame if something happened to them
Cause TwilightSparkle no one leaves ponyvile
8i find your lack of dedication disturbing, ghosties
twilight the gems are basicaly worthless remember?
om nom nom, nom nom
lol Ghosties xD
Ssssssssssssssssssssssss
THey grow in the dirt.
when i first originally saw this episode, a friend of mine came in and thought we were idiots, he then stayed and we were all laughing our asses off
pet pet pet
6Minecon is a minecraft convention
lol, did anyone else see that thread on /pony/ that made the theory that when ponies die they turn into uncut gems? :P
Ghosties, I... Why.

Oh good god.

I just read "Spiderses"

Oh, it's not a "lack of dedication," Hipster. It's a lack of faith in the community, namely Ponychan
Gems are essentially Glitter in Equestria
DRAGOOOOOON
Spike->Rarity is almost the only canon shipping
Hey I'm in chat now! It works
0Cute worse than bread XD

Bucker.
Whinny
spike lol
Those doors. Seriously
Wait twi has ram ability
Twilight is a neighsayer?
shes the only one with the rope on.
kind of a weird message with this episode. 'girls, if you cry and whine and be manipulative you can get what you want.'
That's Whinny was... ...Pooh
Unique strength = whining like a bitch
My god she's like Yahtzee Croshaw.
Stream is offline for me? D:
So... she;s a typical girl then?
acting all cute and clumsy and then busting grown men's faces all day long
Rarity is so smug
I've been... NAUGHTY
*shit I said that's*
Seriously, everypony watch Pinkamena's party scene later, look at the massive wingboner Dash gets from Mr. Turnip, that filly is omnisexual.
stream is fine
Indeed.
4Friendship is Magic kink meme? There pretty much already is one
Yahtzee is funnier.
stream is good
yeah
how'd they get out?
WINGBONER
I feel sorry for them now
rarity has the best designed eyes too
xD
8this episode really needs more Dash
hella cute
Poor dogs
Bashfluff: true
I want to see more Diamond Dogs in Season Two.
The dogs should have teamed with Rarity to form an OPEC like cartel
Just because I'm a bitch doesn't mean I can't manipulate like a Lady.
No
eheheheh
8every episode needs more Dash
each of those harnesses is rusted in the exact same way
implying dash is needed
This episode needs more Apple Bloom
seemingly defenseless?
More Fluttershy
YES IT DOES SO!
THere needs to be more Rarity
Okay ponies are done I'm ready for blazBlue.
Anti-Sexism lesson
Yes it does so... JK
every episode also needs more fluttershy.
all the time everytime
'Wits'. suuuuuuuuure
4If Hipster had his way, every episode would be nothing but Rainbow Dash
Whining = Witty
NOM NOM NOM
WHY? LET HIM HAVE THE GEM
silly Twilight, Rarity is the most badass pony
0Celestia: Where is all this mail coming from? D:
Wow
when MLP ends i hope dash gets a spinoff
Whipping a small baby?
Every episode needs less Dash
imokaywiththis.mlp
atleast 20% more dash
Much less
9going offline for a sec to fix up the stream
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH HALF A GEM
yay
I'm ready for more fanfic reading
flutterwingboner?
WHY U TAKE HALF EATEN GEM
aw, stream's over
every episode needs, say, a DASH of rainbow
but then again i hope MLP doesn't end
Needs about...
Friendship is Gic
Why does she want a half eaten gem?
.....its over already?
