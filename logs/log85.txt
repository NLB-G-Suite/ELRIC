Wicker Man's Already reserved for something else
REDCLIFF
Kill Bill?
Do we only watch PG-13 or lower movies here?

Wicker man is reserved for a special occasion
THE ROOM, aka the worst movie ever
trigun?
yes, and no colors
CLOOOOWNS
THE ROOM OH YES
The room has already been shown
13It makes me think I'm wasting electricity .w.

:0
we already watched the room
I'm still going with anything tron related
0fight club!
Any Mel Brooks movie is awesome, though.

Would b-movie also be considered critical success, commercial failure?
6well you can turn of the monitor if you want
I would also vote for Blazzing Saddles
6off
worth the weight
LABYRINTH
9okay gents
