AJIsAwesome: r u a girl .-.
Shizuka: LET US ASCENDS TO THE LIGHT! FOR CHOCOLATE BARS! ...with nuts...
Prince_Lightstar: :S
Clearly the team hasn't been satisfied with the quality of your appeals
No, I'm not.
who da hell is singing
AJIsAwesome: i called u a lady .-.
:P
VenHur: CHOCOLATE?
streamer fal again
i like that song\
VenHur: Did you just say.....CHOCOLATE?
Using a spellchecker and making sure you use proper punctuation and grammar would make it look a lot better to start with.
http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
its the soundtrack from the movie twister
AJIsAwesome: Yes sir!
AJIsAwesome: With or without nuts?
Chocolate? CHOCOLATE?!
dayum dose some big trees!
what is this mod
BEHOLD THE FLUTTATREES
Feed the Beast!
^mod name
No
You also seem to ramble about things quite irrelevent to your ban, and which often seem to have no decipherable meaning.
I would like to be a tree
ye
donotwant
MEANWHILE, IN THE HALL OF SHIZUKA
Barbetos: No means yes!
I AM a tree.
jcelios: wat do u feed the beast?
Prince_Blueblood soylent green
whoa
dem trees
dem trees idd
im predicting im not gonna be unbanned
I'm not sure of the origin of the name but I think of it as minecraft being the beast and the large number of new stuff as the food :P
Thos are some REAL trees
also what's the music? it reminds me of diablo 2
HAX
do the sound effect come with mod?
probably
Yes sir
Marco: i think its led zeppelin
It doesnt
Sorry about hta
oh kewl
dat sream
On an appeal you don't generally say why you want to be unbanned, rather state why you were banned, and what will do differently, what you have learnt, why we should give you another chance, etc.
Shizuka: PLZ DONT CAPS SRRY
I'm confused
Marco: or maybe pink floyd
can i answer those right now?
oh
/me shrugs
either way, i like it
science is used in the makin of this stream
science you say?
true that youngun
Deacon: yes
I think it would be better for you to write an appeal, then you will have more time to think over what you're written, edit it; make sure it has proper spelling and grammar.
http://derpy.me/I3e5i
I can't see the difference the last part

Yay, Scootaloos!
Apple Bloom hawt
Yeeha7 but why? she's sweet
dem rain sounds~
Yeeha7: yeah, this isnt 4chan
jk
why not use steam engines?
or the force.
sure they require coal but, i think its a bit faster
about that, sometimes /mlp/ scares me more than /b/ does, silly internet :<
Why.
eh, /mlp/ seems tame to me
dunnaw, it's like... yeah... no
well, anthro horse porn can be fairly terrifying
yep
Buytoast: true true
it's just that mlp is precious and innocent to me, but i should have known that the internet would make it go all /b/
ohwell C:
so apparently new epic rap battle
santa kicked some major ass
emangamer: really?
the epic rap battles are terrible
thelonecubone yeah, santa vs moses
ah
didnt really like the new erbs lately
wat? not even jesus vs moses?
the new one is awesome, next to moses
lately?
moses did pretty bad ><
I like krampus.
hmkay
I think there are two different people doing epic pony rap battles. One of them seems to be a lot better than the other
but i did like the doctor who vs doc brown~
Midnight_Fyre I think they just actually added people to it not a different cast
ME AGIAN! :D
I do like yaplap doing the persenting
wb Ponies47 :)
Ponies47 pls go you left already
:I
emangamer: Well, they are uploaded on two different accounts and one of the accounts has much higher quality rapping than the other
shub, be nice
:I
the EPRBoE was really really close
Midnight_Fyre no, they switched to EPRBoE instead of on mic's channel
the what now?
so who is minecrafting it up in the stream?
epic pony rap battles of equestria
any kind of "epic rap battles" are terrible
any plans for all that water you're collecting shizu?
Neither one is mic's channel. That said, they very well could be the same people behind them both, and it seems probable if it is
man the pony battle was really close...
hm, rap isn't my favourite music genre, but i do enjoy the epic rap battles slightly, i like how they go all dressed up top notch so they actually match the real character's looks and stuff
I dunno who won :/
I do generally hate rap, but the rap battles are fun
I'd say it's a draw honestally ><
anyone else notice how the front of Diamond Tiaras mane looks like a painted turd?
lol
nope, never noticed that
>mlfw i read it as Iron Tank Vulva
TheGentleManBrony: lolwat
Or gak
SOrry.
that stuff.
lol
Oh dear Luna D:
fucks that stuff.
i kind of liked the *censored* spam
I just found a pony fic reference in The Amazing World of Gumball D:
the stuff with the name.
that gets said a lot
time for mass collection of lava
It most be rubberized troll fat
also, hai all :>
lel
ello Kurra
must*
Kurra: what is it?
and ohai
Drew: what are you referring to?
The g word
amazing world of gumball is bad too
It's the G to the A and then come the K, don't you be mentioning it or someone'll kick your A
So I got the Season 1 DVD in the mail a few days ago and I was watching Boast Busters on the TV tonight, and my mom and sister walked in in the middle of it and sat down to watch the second half. Now they think I'm weirder than ever
its a reference to one of the scary fics.
hello everypony

Hi texasboykc09
Alright everypony. I am off to bed! Night! :)
What is this mod?

Thank you for the stream, Shizuka. :)
night Sabershy
Night, Sabershy. :)
Night Sabershy :)
*guessing because of
sleep is for the weak.
Gumball confuses me, it's setting is really random
I like the fact that many of the characters allude to real life social exclusions that adults do.
s/weak/mortal organic life forms/
oh yeah... no regex bot
WHY'S THAT?
all the characters are random too
Hai everypony

I'm glad fluttershy doesn't have minecraft, she would be terrified of the creepers
hihi
we'd give her a diamond armor, that'll do
you silly, just use your flying powers!
kidzrul732: it would be cute towatch her play.
I can totally imagine her playing Bio Shock
too bad we never will
in this dimension!
haha "would you kindly 'yay?'" :D
life sucks. :(
:(
neigh
in before Shizuka jumps off the tree
let's create a portal to a parallel universe where all humans are ponies
but life is fun, only problem I have with the game is the respawning glitch
DerpyMuffins, Could you kindly give me a cookie :3
Deacon: true that!
Marco is Reverse Lyra
xD
Scones are the best I can do thelonecubone
mans: you are a mad man! how do we do it?!
thelonecubone: we don't have cookies here, you might try asking the Dark Side
oh
NullRadix: i'll try
Marco do we even have that technology? 0.o
we're more of a muffin and cupbake crowd
i suppose not... yet LT_SKINNY :(
thelonecubone: Do you mind if you help me with something? :)
or they're just hiding it from us!
cupbake. lol
om nom
AJIsAwesome: okay
Alright. One minute.
Everytime someone pronounces Lyra as Leera I cringe and get the urge to punch the computer.
Big Brother is hanging out with ponies... those BASTARDS :[
well, the most realistic answer to individually visiting parallel universes is lucid dreaming :3
like some people that pronounce mario as "mare Y oh?"
That's actually valid.
Marco: I have yet to perfect that :/
ProTip: practice meditation, it really helps
the possibilities of your mind are like.. endless!
For meditation u need green tea.
at least I do.
green tea is neat :3

Deacon: bye
Bai Deacon.
thank u for agreeing with me about Sweetie Belle.
and shti.
shit
afk
he made me lose the game with his quit message :|
KILL THE GOAT!!!
So does the music just come with the game or is Shizuka playing it?
i'm wondering that as well
i'm guessing it's not in game
it's not bad.
minecraft has music. I'm fairly sure this isn't it
cool.
Derpy needs her own episode
I prefer Aphex Twin and Autechre as far as electronic music goes.
FINE
DerpyMuffins: damnright.
... just doesn't seem to fit the environment
Maybe play some Tom Waits?
or metal.
Tom Waits is better.
bunk!
08,01AJIsAwesome: hey

Gah, I hate it when my computer freezes. :I
13oh and no wonder the fucking mods were spamming the error log again...
Shizuka: only some days?

13you seriously thought this was minecraft music?
java always sucked :<

Done already Shizuka?
Shizuka: done already
dude...so...pertty.
what i'm currently doing is pondering how to share steamapps betwene windows and linux
waitwat, he already left like a few minutes ago, and now he re-left
nvm
and it's indeed pretty :>
Phase4: share?
sup
ohai
Marco: use the same copy in both systems
g2g c yous soon :)
oh, i don't think that's going to work
hai EmeraldChocolate
Did I miss Shizu's stream?
In about 19 minutes ;)
i mean bai :P
:)
bai :)
Cypresswolf: yep
Drat :(
it 'just works' betwene multiple windows installs, same with linux, but windows and its silly canse insensetivity
Bye EmeraldChocolate :)
i'm considering the various operating systems
i meen filesystems
words are hard
Bye Shizuka!
What did she play tonight?
that was awesome.
Thanks Shizuka
/me plays E.G.G.M.A.N
Minecraft.
Phase4: but linux doesn't support executables
Thanks for streaming
Cypresswolf: minecraft
you could always try wine or mono, but it's going to cause lag for sure
Shizuka: thanks for the stream
thanks indeed, enjoyed it :3
Marco: uh... linux cant launch .exe's natively sure but i'm not interested in that
thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
Sorry I missed out on that
In memories of the Buffer Show...
oh, what is it then?
it wasent boring.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGZzayBtHgw
Marco: i'm in the steam for linux beta
and would primarally like to share the tf2 content files which are the same across all operating systems
ah
eyup
How is steam on linux Phase4?
i hate when i close the wrong tab
well, i didn't get invited for the steam for linux beta :( so i wouldn't know
DerpyMuffins: so far its almost perfect
VenHur: I perfer this over the Buffer Show
wb Yeeha7
poor texasboykc09 :P
DerpyMuffins: its actually more stable than on windows
wb?
opengl > activex :D
only problems i'm finding are the result of graphics driver problems
mostly nvidia and their bug ridden crap
Any lag so far Phase4?
Marco: i think you meen direct x XD
who gonna stream next?
yeah yeah :<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLeqLaIFNx0
DerpyMuffins: nvidia driver bug causes some problems and it lags a bit when loading resources
cl_forcepreload 1 solves most of the latter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BL5EKwSqE fireplace
why does it remind me of the 11th doctor's theme?
back
wb
thanks :)
wat i miss?
DerpyMuffins: if it wasnt for nvidias lack of propper optimus suport it would actually be faster on linux
FIER!!!!!!

Phase4: yep
Is it in beta or alpha right now Phase4?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXa6GaEozV4
DerpyMuffins: steam is in beta
Phase4: what was the worst software you ever used?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBmeD8KU0hI&list=PLyvqv_dznLtxX_XhGHIQgvLZioPp7WtUx&index=19
Any file share problems Phase4?
dat jaymoo
dat aniderp
texasboykc09: thats a complicated question
phase4 how?
There are systems worst in some areas
texasboykc09: because there are various kinds of bad
well theres the software that simply doesnt work, the well implimented but poorly designed stuff, the poorly implimented but well designed
and the poorly implimented and poorly designed (this usualy simply doesnt work)
^ I know that feel
Phase4: that explains why
what are we hating on?

CTHULHU: They stream when they can. :)

yeaah right, like i'm gonna believe that
Phase4 I need to make it a habit to read The Moderator every now and again. So much feels
Marco: you leave the computer, that means you have a life
/me realizes he has a test tomorrow he hasnt studied for O_O
....shit
emangamer: D:
you're so screwed
thats not good :(
psh, studyin is for nerds
it's fine, I know it pretty okay
emangamer: thats me
Sleep on your textbook emangamer, it helps
emangamer: Study, you fool! D:
DerpyMuffins: :D
I'm pretty good at human geo
i didn't study for my ACT and i got a double digit number
I guess I dont got one.
Lawl Buytoast
thelonecubone: nahhh they don't ;D
Buytoast: but Uncle sam Studyin to be the Best Killing Machine
Buytoast seems legit...
we don't need to study that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijzMnFr-8Tc&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz Anthropology!
we're naturally born killing machines
Buytoast: did you pass
BuytoastI didnt study for my ACT and got like a 28
hey, i got a 27!
you see
doode
high five
i didnt take the ACT
studyin is for nerds
just the SAT
ACT?
(\
great job :D
but in college
I barely got a 26 on my ACT
I have a question
a 27 is good an ANY TEST
shit i dont remember the SAT
all two did well i see
emangamer: out of 100? nah
When I took the SAT two years ago, I think I got a 2060...
^^
why can't we have musicals like singing in the rain or the music man today?
ACT and SAT are based out of 34
i got a 2170 on my SAT
27/34 isn't bad
sat is based out of a 34?
SAT is out of 2400
how da hell did I get a 28
CrystalPhoenix: We can. They're called "The Music Man" and "Singing in the Rain". We still have them.
2120
^*
Oh fuck, the Sat. Damn it
Damn, wrong test
hell, the only thing that screwed me over with the ACT was the math part
34 is near impossible to get on the ACT though
And the ACT is out of 36
not 34
So close
I have a friend who got a 35
well then 36 is near impossible
Kencolt, did you get what I meant
yeah, I heard its pretty tough to get 25+
What is the ACT, by the way?
optional test you dont have to take
A standardized test
a smart thing
but makesy ou look way better
Have some opera
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&index=26
Well...
Harvard requires you get atleast a 32

Kencolt: same as SAT only somewhat different sections
Tests you on different things
DerpyMuffins: there arent any requirements, persay, although yes, assuming you are going for athletics, they would like to see AT LEAST that
Why are we talking about test?
because we can
Because theres no stream :D
iirc it was ACT with the "science" section? damn that section was dumb, just have to be able to read fast in the morning
I meant how did it start?
didnt actually require any knowledge of science
you think what?
Didnt you start the SAT/ACT discussion?
no
oops...
but seriously I just finished watching singing in the rain and it made me think
that would be Buytoast
^
there you go :P
what now?
Do the actors today really deserve the praise they have?
Some do
you started the standardized test discussion
I want more musical dammit
they are fun
which is kind of obsolete to me at least, I got admitted recently
Btw you scored one higher than me Buytoast
ha
and oh god I love tap shoe
Bucknell Univeristy
my mind is greater
Uncle Sam would be proud.
Congrats!
thanks
Anyone know the requirement for Princeton?
There arent requirements
*no
Loads of money
Ive been at Sacramento State for 2 years now studying Fire Admin...
Loads of money: uncheck
LOOK OUT MEANWHILE
CrystalPhoenix: Well... those were mostly made for a different time, for a different audience-- from the Busby Berkley stuff in the depression (everyone needed cheering up) to WW2 (Much the same, but more patriotic) to the fifties (When everyone was still somewhat innocent).
HERE I COME
Kencolt, yeah I know....
You just have to fill out the application, get all the forms in, and hope you qualify as an applicant. there arent any "requirements". Applying to college is a rat race
but gosh would I do anything for a good musical
You try to make a flim like that today, with the modern audience of kids-- kids then liked that kind of thing, and well, it was more for the parents at times. TOday? You have a pack of teens wondering where the heck the blood and sex is.
THERE ARE NO MINIMUMS. JUST BOTTOM PERCENTILES
JEEZ
emangamer: theyre entirely optional in some schools
Kencolt, yeah that is very sad
90 percent of the applicants who apply to Harvard are qualified. however, they can only accept 8 percent of their application pool
you have to stand out
Back then, you went to the movies as a family. Usually a double feature. One that the adults liked mostly-- often your musical-- and then a B picture, like a western, so the kids could thrill to whoever wore the white hat shooting the bad guy with the mustache.
I thought it was 6%
something like that
Bottom line: College is a pain getting in, but once you are it gets alil easier
Nope
Also a pack of shorts, a newsreel, and in some of the BIG movie palaces, short concerts-- they's have a small orchestra playing inbetween showings.
LT_SKINNY: in most cases
You need to pass the classes
i.e. Cornell is the easiest Ivy to get into, hardest one to stay in
Well derp :P Id expect nothing less from the people who DID make it in
Not to mention the student loans.....
paying off loans are probably hte worst part
^
I'm going to pay mines for the next decade or so
...why?
It really was, after all, a different world back then. Heh-- maybe that's why we like MLP so much, that world kind of hearkens back to a simpler time, without being condecending.
^
i guess, but thats a whole year of college: probably the best 4 years of your life, out the window
If you take enough AP classes you can practically skip a few years of collage
suite yourself
30k?
give or take a few thousand
Thats a pretty sizeable loan... :/
Private school?
^
I can see VT being 30k
no it's sizable
out of state? yes
Soon Scootaloo, soon http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355192661438.jpg
I had to take out 5k for my Fire Academy
/me thinks it's halirious his host name is .vt.edu in it XD
damn camput internet
?
why is that funny?
It helps if you know the teachers at the collage you go to
I dont nkow, it just is
sure
means I cant sneak around under a false nick either
everyone knows it's me
or PonyNegZero
\
yeah or him
either of you
Pneg is pretty legit
btw, can I register my nickname here?
yes you can
It's way easier being a NEET.
oh man
you guys
hey you guys
yes?
what?
?
NOSTALGIA TIME
rawr
XD
/me can swing his sword sword sword his diamond sword
Was wondering when Phase4 would come in
Did you find your old alias?
sadly it's not registered any more
i'm elsewhere making tech things happen
In fact, screw the tech xD
if you wanted real Nastolgia, emantrollslayer, we would have 80ish of the coolest people ever
i like the 90's.

I prefer the 90's seeing as how I was born in them :D
thelonecubone: Use it for BMN. :D
Dont forget ScootaChicken, LadyC, LC, Vivi, Nyria...

Okay, thanks CrystalPhoenix
emantrollslayer: believe it or not, otakon is not known for that anymore
...both are kind of outdated. classic, but outdated
overused, is the better word
the fact they were overused was what made the mhalirious
dat otakon quit XD

"OMG VA IN CHAT, VA IN CHAT, ABANDON SHIP!"
:p

I've seen it on YouTube but the GNAA attack was my first time here.
Ryunosuke: Nah, I don't see it as that. The Last Roundup moment was somewhat unexpected, while this will be posted on the homepage.
^^^^^^^^^^^s Justin bieber after the dentist
and honestly
Soulless_DCLXVI: I don't think they've found out who it was, if I recall.
----> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geTCP666Yf4
how many of the 2000-3000 people that watch on saturday mornings, read the front page of BS?
:)
I think the g-word also counted as unexpected :P
Ryunosuke: The people who do?
Still, how will saturday be like The Last Roundup?
well
Derpy's offical apperance?
at least for us, the show is gonna be hijacked I think
and canonization?
That ould be AWESOME. But HIGHLY unlikely.
would*
Ryunosuke: Mm, I don't see that happening.
Uh... you people still here? I've never seen the chat still for so long....
Yep.
lol
:P
Okay, good. Thought maybe I lagged out or something.

the ONLY thing good to come out of that
I used to be utterly revolted by their crap. But it's grown on me.
is the "Watch out Ashleigh" video

FiM is actually killing itself, imo
eh, it aint something spectacular
OneTrickPony!
OneTrickPony: brohoof from one caliboy to another? /)

okay, I've made my mind up
Why would we?
Ron Paul 2012
05,15Because it'd be hilarious
I am now imagining a very large chicken holding a box with various personal items crying as he leaves an office building.
I think iron will won the newest epic rap battle of equestria
sorry off topic, had to say it
Crap, Ive yet to see it...
Eh, not to me. It's somewhat revolting.
I FUCKING CALLED IT
How good was it, emantrollslayer?
Anyone who didnt think the stream hijack was at least the slightest bit amusing needs to calm their nips about seeing ponies... minus the tech team and streamer ofc
LT_SKINNY really good
it couldn't be good
Now I must see it... :I
Cya all! bai!
Bye, EmeraldChocolate :)
05,15It was. I lol'd
05,15Then I srsd
emantrollslayer: its on youtube
EmeraldChocolate: bye
05,15then I lol'd again
bye EmeraldChocolate
It wasn't amusing to me, because it was my FIRST TIME watching it live. I was excited and had been on Bronystate for like two hours beforehand.
Good morning everypony, i have returned ^_^
Soulless_DCLXVI then yes, I actually feel bad for you
but I mean c'mon
it's still pretty funny
05,15I can understand that. That does suck
NocturnalBlade: hello
if only you guys had me around to slay them
wb NocturnalBlade
excitement was made to be crushed by dissapointment
A little bit, now. But at the time I was bloody LIVID.
As a hijack attempt, it was funny. But as a LIVESTREAM hijack, it was annoying.
/me slices up a statue of RAWRity
^^
emantrollslayer: you mean business... 0.0
05,15I hate how it wasn't even our fault, it was mips, yet people think it was ours
fluttercry: ikr
wait what happened?
13OMFG BRONYSTAET GOT HAXXORED WHAT NOOBS
OneTrickPony: Mips got hijacked.
wat how?
I don't know who mips is, but I only blame the attackers. Not the defenders.
Shizuka IDK MY BFF JILL
13mips sucks at security
Security hole, I think?
13therefore we haven't used them in weeks
oh
TOTALLY WASN'T THE PROVIDERS FAULT THERE MUST BE AN INSIDER LEAKING THE EMBED TO THE GNAA FIJSLAFJSAF
05,15Mips was our streaming service, then we found out they are awful
13WHY IS IT DIFFERENT
05,15I DON'T LIKE DIFFERENT
wat, did they use a MSOD attack or somethin?
what was streamed?
IDK MY BFF ROSE
13DIFFERENT BAD
because mips is as secure as a thin blanket on a giant fan
inb4 Rose` wakes up in her sleep
13LT_SKINNY: Mips publishes one of the two secret keys needed to broadcast right in the player embed
Shizuka: Thats... slightly retarded
13yes it is
Shizuka: So how get second one?
For all those talking about "different". This is what you made me think of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIrXKpv2gw
05,15pffft Family Guy
13XAX: the twit that did it was in possession of some exploit to get the other half of the key
13but only for mips
Shizuka: l33t
11,02SHHHHHHHHH
05,15Soulless_DCLXVI this if for pros
05,15http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgDiCnYjog&feature=youtu.be
11,02Sasha is asleep
13all the other embeds aren't as hilariously stupid
^
13and ustream autoplays, so we like them
As I said, retarded exploit is retarded...
Shizuka: it also plays on ios divces
11,02Weird how having a U in the name of something makes everything better...
and then he blamed /v/ and everyone went and went all YOU STOP MUH PONY on them
That was funny.
13in the end it was actually some loser who just wanted people to watch his stream instead
11,02pls
lol
13how pathetic do you get
11,02I'm a Professional Moderator.
05,15./v/ is too busy arguing with themselves over Vidya Games to hack
Shizuka: Welcome to the Internet.
05,15also yeah, just someone wanting traffic
Yeah, I'm gonna be honest. I totally fell for the /v/ line.
fluttercry: >implying /v/ plays vidya gaems and don't just LE SHITPOST XD
SillyFilly64 the most pro 1337 mod since ever
13sb, jokes from mod chat do not really translate well to mane chat without context
05,15XAX they TRY to have vidya
05,15....try
measly attempt
bitch please
It usually just degrades to Back2Reddit as far as I ever saw.
'tis a flesh wound!
05,15All the cool kids hang out at Giant Bomb for vidya
/me brushes the spagetti out of his face
Shizuka: nor do regular jokes
11,02Shizuka: It was a big thing on Twitter today :o
thought /mlp/ is the same. as soon as someone comes in acting all typical brony, "back to ponychan pls".
SillyFilly64: I followed you :3
11,02XAX: Yay :3
XAX get on my level
I stalk SillyFilly64
/me hugs XAX
05,15./mlp/ is too busy trying to make Tulpas to actually have a discussion
everyone always talks about that Twipper thing
Wait, /mlp/ doesn't like bronies? Odd.
fluttercry: Tulpas?
I'll never understand 4chan....
11,02I think
fluttercry I have to admit, the /mlh/ threads can be funny as hell sometimes
11,02and correct me if I'm wrong
psh, /mlp/ only likes two things
11,02But in my personal opinion
tulpas and horse porn
/mlp/ doesn't need a period at the beginning
fluttercry: as far as i can tell, if you want discussion, MLPG threads are where it's at.
13twitter is for people whose thoughts don't exceed 140 characters
05,15So, perfect for ADD teenagers
Shizuka: ouch
11,02There is a group of people who like MLP who are known as Bronies and those who hate the show who are known as Anti-Bronies.
Shizuka but you have a twitter though...
13and see how much use it gets?
Go on....
@Shizuka: i agree.
...not much :/
11,02You have a Twitter? D:
So... Twitter is for short-minded people? :P
hell, i only have one of those facebook things and it only gets updated about once in a blue moon
13i think i last tweeted... two years ago?
Yeah, twitter is for short minded people. Eg: mandopony.
05,15I only tweet about cool stuff. Like Gyrobowls
Hey, BronyState. I just came from /mlp/, so I am going to have to try hard to behave (which I will).
i dont got a twitter and im glad.
fluttercry: AMEN
KrazyNoobs: "hi guys im le new ill be good promis XD"
fluttercry: did you see those biblical spoofs i did for Gyrobowl?
I have been here for 6 weeks
/me watches the spaghetti pour out of KrazyNoobs's pockets
KrazyNoobs: I browse that board daily, yet I don't need to announce that i'm gonna try control myself.
Ive been here for only three... Im so vet :D

the G-word?
Oh.... it took me a sec to figure out what you were talking about.
that wasnt even funny
00,02fluttercry, stompiez?
CTHULHU That G-word is back on December 14. Brace yourselves
00,02>_>
fluttercry: you as an OP can say it

Shizuka: yep

13can you spell it?
GOD FUCKIN DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
g-a-k
00,02CTHULHU, calm down man

i spelled it
I got kicked for saying the g-word even though I didnt say it!
ok ok im good
still mad tho.
Honestly don't understand why the word can't be said if it's not being used as spam fodder.
gaк is the true god, one day you will accept it
dat twilight_squirtle and his Russian chars
No, FSM is the one true god.
13NO
What is happening?
13nicolas cage is the one true god
basedgod is the only god
13and i can prove it
tracy is best OC
Blasphemy!
well, nicolas cage is pretty MLG too
13http://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod
Tommy Wasseau > Nic Cage
13check. mate.
Yer both wrong - Play Doh will alway be the superior stuff
:P
Shizuka, r/....aww you beat me to it
Shizuka everyone knows cage is a 1000 year old vampire
I am my one god.
Shizuka: Great, now I have to convert
You shall burn in the lake of boiling pasta sauce for your heresy.
Cage is the god of gods
he claims all religions
I thought Wesker was the only god?
yeah, cause le reddit decides gods.
adrian brody is also demigod tier
and im his.
Im fairly certain Vivi is god
...ess
twilight_squirtle: yes
13yes
Vivi? from that Kid Icarus game?
nuuuuuu
no!
LT_SKINNY: :D
LT_SKINNY: Nope, Mod here. :)
I havent seen her in a while
this is going to be another night of weird sleep habits - might stay here to 2 am
^
:I... Im gonna sit in the corner now...
05,15I really should go to sleep. I have to get up at 6:30 tomorrow to be at school in time for exam
05,15But....Bronystate
You ALL have weird sleep habits as far as I'm concerned. Honestly, awake during the day? Sleeping all night? Weird...
eh
13wat
134am to 1pm
Exactly! fluttercry
fluttercry: inb4 imgonnagetagoodnightsleep.jpg
fluttercry: sleep? nope
LT_SKINNY: Nah, don't. Some newcomers don't know that Shizu's a she.
fluttercry: you dont need sleep, it's bad for you
05,15AJIsAwesome newfoals don't know bout mah mods
It's 0107 here
I should pass out
I wonder what I used to do during my insomnia spells....oh wait - xbox!
I love it when people call Sumi a she
oh the hilarity
05,15People constantly think I'm a she
This newfoal wishes to learn so he doesnt make a constant ass of himself xD
fluttercry YOU'RE NOT A SHEEEEEEEEE????????? ....shocking
13mfw this track is not on youtube...
05,15inb4 you all thought I was a girl and i've blown your minds
fluttercry: How so?
and thanks for the kind words, AJIsAwesome :)
making sure I don't lose this nick
not very efficient, ended up staying up the rest of the night, sleeping during lunch hour, end up hungry all day - I was a train wreck
nah, people just think sumi is a girl because OCs clearly indicate gender.
Honestly, I assume everyone's male until proven otherwise.
LT_SKINNY: No problem. :)
emantrollslayer: i saw him at bronycon. pretty convincing if you ask me
lol fluttercry
lord knows I've had it forever
13register it then?
I have
13speaking of better refresh my hold on vivi's
you lose nicks if you don't use them you know
mfw Shizuka knows Vivi's pass?
13no
13vivi's nick expired
Whatever a person's name looks and sounds like to me is what gender i assume they are until i'm told otherwise lol
How necessary is registering a name like mine?
13so i attached it to my alt for safekeeping
Shizuka: ah, setting up shop then
LT_SKINNY: So that people don't use your name.
LT_SKINNY: depends entirely on how paranoid you are
LT_SKINNY: To impersonate you.
all better now
just have to remember to do it once a month .-.
Asuka: no mod impersonation please
:P
oh wait
lol
Asuka: ?
fail
you dont need the password to someone's account to impersonate you
KJN EK
05,15just be careful when you are identifying and don't type your password into chat like I did
05,15twice
lrn2whois silly fillies
Can i register my nick on the embeded chat?
fluttercry: You did that? ._.
yeah
I better register then :D
same commands as a client as far as I know
13still annoying that irssi doesn't pass through quit messages, not sure why
fluttercry: forgot the / ?
Asuka: Hey, this client aint the sharpest in id-ing y'know
NocturnalBlade: The ponychat window at the bottom will allow you insert command messages.

Soulless_DCLXVI: You just insert the command.
sweet, my nick is now locked in :)
Soulless_DCLXVI: It's best if you input it in the ponychat window below.

05,15Someone tried to impersonate me once
I want to make some stew - all I had was a sandwich with cider & cider w/whiskey
Hanako It worked just now for me :/
I let people use my nicks
unless they annoy me
fluttercry: i remember that
fluttercry: what happen
Cypresswolf: Aw man, that sucks. :<
woo, i got my name :)
in which case I ghost the living daylights out of them
WHY
05,15texasboykc09 I don't actually know, i just saw it when I logged in one day. I have no idea what they di
no veggies to put in it though - I could at least make the base for now
05,15I guess nothing too bad
NocturnalBlade: brohoof ?)
http://i.imgur.com/GnwZ8.jpg whadaya think of my brack flops 2 emblem
./)*
05,15nice
05,15I have like...8 emblems that I use
XAX: MLG.
my cooking'll stick with you for awhile :)
05,15none of them pony
LT_SKINNY: *nods* brohoof (\
fluttercry: do you the PC or the consolessss?
haha afk
Well, you don't NEED to have pony emblems.
05,15My favorite ones are the Union Jack and the Game Grumps logo
05,15I worked hard on those
XAX: not bad...my tag on Halo 4 is BRNY lol
aight, im off
Uh. Excellent. The deed has been done.
night guys
05,15XAX BLOPS2 I do on Xbox
Thanks guys
fluttercry: ah.
fluttercry: Is it the boopinest?
05,15It is
NocturnalBlade: my tag on bo2 is [pone]
05,15Also I came across a guy the other night with the name "I kill Bronies"
as you saw
/me wants BL2
2 lbs ground beef, worchester sauce, spice mix, 2 cans of chili, black beans, potatoes, stewed tomatoes, carrots, celery and onions ^_^ could eat that the rest of the week
fluttercry: :D
05,15He....didn't last long
XAX: eeyup
fluttercry: lel
fluttercry: wow really :D
Makes sense why he didn't.
fluttercry: >tfw most bronies i see on BO2 play badly
;_;
perhaps a whisky marinade this time :O
hmm.. still debating on getting blops 2
05,15I pretty much refuse to play without a full team, or at least 4 people. Luckily the people I roll with are always online
XAX: i kinda want black ops 2...i still think i would do bad though lol
/me can't wait till BF4
fluttercry: thats the best way lol
/me is still enjoying BF3
^
The only game I'm looking forward to is GTA V.
i usually play arone in random lobbies with no friends
i still have fun
05,15I enjoyed BF3 until I reached the max rank and unlocked everything I wanted
COD needs a new engine
but id probably have more with my friends
OneTrickPony: BO2 had a lot added to the engine, graphically. HDR lighting, DX11 support, etc
yea bf3 can get a bit dull once you have everything
:I
05,15Over the winter break I plan on finally beating XCOM
they even added Havok physics to the engine
XAX: oh
my stew pot is in the sink...it'll have to wait...
05,15I'm going to name all my soldiers after the MST3K Space Mutiny names
13gentlemen
13i give you asuka's new theme
13http://youtu.be/eM6kZB2XBmI
05,15dem horns
dat beat right from the start
starts out epic Shizuka i like it :D
13i would link the first six minutes of rebuild 3.0 but do not want to spoil
13suffice to say
13hot shit :D
Yeah, it's pretty epic from the start.
05,15I'm only on like...episode 5 of Evangelion but so far I really like it
Shizuka: is there any place I can watch Evangelion 3.0 for free?
13not yet
oh
13camrips are leaking very very slowly at horrible quality
13DVD will land in the states sometime next year
back
wb LT_SKINNY
well, ill be looking forward to that
Welcome back, LT_SKINNY. :)
wb LT_SKINNY
05,15Even though things are okay now, I get this sinking feeling that by the end of the series I'm going to feel like I got punched in the guy
05,15gut*
Thanks all :P
13very much so
05,15it's giving off those vibes
Soooo...i started playing WoW again XD
What's giving off those vibes?
fluttercry: You'll see.
NocturnalBlade: sounds like a cry for help. When would you like your intervention?
raa.
13if you listen to that video, you'll see the kind of energy it releases
meep
/me as arrived in the middle of something o.o
MEEP
Interesting enough, NGE was one of the first animes I watched when I got back into anime.
Hello, Kurra. :)
NullRadix: no, just happens everytime there is a new race lol nothing to big to worry about ^_^
hihi
hi Kurra
Hey Kurra
hello Kurra
13now if only this track was on youtube anywhere....
I got into anime through Angel Beats
.-.
LOVED Angel Beats
05,15http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/106/106133.jpg
05,15I saw this earlier and it made me lol
hai Kurra
MEEPMEEPMEEP
I only watch moeshit
hihi OneTrickPony
Soulless_DCLXVI: it was really good, but I wish it was longer
G-- is back on December the 14th to THe Hub, AND IT'S OFFICIAL
I think my first anime was Sailor Moon via Toonami... good times haha
13ah sailor moon
13the DIC dub
I loved Angel Beats as well.
05,15I never watched Sailor Moon
upotte
Shizuka: affirmative :D
and strike witches
The chatroom is going to break during Season 3 Episode 7 because of ---'s trumphiant return
and lucky star
come the fuck at me
First anime I ever watched was Dragonball, if I recall.
05,15and my first anime was Yu-Yu-Hakusho followed by Cowboy Bebop
First anime for me was Pokemon
do i detect spoilar |u
I was 4
I just finished Gunslinger Girl and that was pretty good
KrazyNoobs: and wrek will go crazy
Oh, I LOVED Yu-Yu-Hakisho.
u|
|u
:O Yu-yu-Hakisho, loved it lol
Good, I miss being 6 :'(
:v
God*
05,15Then I stopped watching anime for years. Been trying to get back into it for a while now
>8v....
texasboykc09 Only on #BronyState, that word is banned. On all the 6 rooms that unlock during the new episode, you can say --- as much as you want. :)
That Critical Miss comic was funny.
oh fuck
KrazyNoobs: unless Wrek is in it
05,15I need more giant robots
OneTrickPony: Yes, gunslinger girl
how could I forget that
also baccano
first anime i watched was sailor moon.
Hanako: yea, it was interesting
13oh wait what am i doing, i should be audiosurfing this track
CTHULHU: i think that was the same for me
Anyone else here dislike watching dubbed anime?
CTHULHU: Glad to hear Im not the only one :P
05,15Cowboy Bebop is one of those anime that's actually better dubbed if you ask me
13same with ghost in the shell
i think so too.
hah
I still need to watch Nichijou, that show is cute. :D
yes.
better and dubbed don't work
together
13you haven't heard bebop or GITS then
GITS and Cowboy Bebop <3
^
^^
05,15Cowboy Bebop is better dubbed. The charaters just make more sense
05,15Same with Black Lagoon
Nichijou looks good
wait
fluttercry: i've only seen CB dubbed lol
huge difference
^^^^^
the first mange i read was chobits.
http://derpy.me/BTi7K the sun is getting larger
Was anyone here when Sumica streamed that one anime where in order to upgrade to higher classes they needed to beat other teams?
Hanako: um... Id do research on which one is more reputable to the source material
Boondocks. Nuff said
05,15same with Gurren Lagann
Hanako: Thats good to hear :)
05,15I liked that one about ghosts that they when they dubbed it, they changed it and turned it into a comedy
AJIsAwesome: i remember that lol it was funny ^_^
XAX: i dont think its the sun thatsgetting biger.
05,15also, they need to hurry up and dub the Persona 4 anime.
NocturnalBlade: Do you recall the name?
05,15Because that's how I know those characters
CTHULHU: thatsthejoke.png
I just cant stand the monotone English VA's... piss me off real bad at some points :/
^
I'm not enough of a weaboo
not dedicated enough
05,15Good luck. you need like over 2000 hours to become even somewhat proficient
AJIsAwesome: Baka to Test to Shōkanjū: Ni! yay for google lol
oh fuck I forgot railgun and index
Bu dui
watch both of those
Im bilingual in Spanish, so I can give it a shot :)
Thanks, NocturnalBlade. :)
no prob lol
I am learning Chinese right now, so close enough
...I am in a brony chat discussing animu
05,15Mandarin or Cantonese?
/me has lost control of her life
Mandarin
05,15Cantonese is clearly the correct answer
no
05,15Because Hong Kong is best pony
lol
Hanako: Welcome to the herd :P
nonono
I was a brony once
no longer
Hanako: That depends. Have you made any chocolate pudding?
Then why are you here?
^
Soulless_DCLXVI: Not everyone here's a brony.
oh
because I still have friends on this network
Really? That's... counter intuitive.
AJIsAwesome: I did that the first time I was here at exactly 4:00
I have never thought of that
05,15Why are you making chocolate pudding?
Meh, we are what we are, so I dont give any mind to it
it was the S2 premiere
That makes sense I guess.
05,15Did you lose control of your life?
Soulless_DCLXVI: Some people come here for the random streams and movies.
I did in fact
:3 was a time a man could cook at 4 am without losing control
Well, at least I can take solace in the fact that most here are bronies. And I doubt anyone here is a hater.
^
I dont know when that was, myself
"bronies" get on my fucking nerves sometimes
:(
but meh, don't hate the show or the fans or anything
how?
05,15One of my closest brony friends actually started out as a hate
05,15hater*
Hanako: That's understadable, if I can picture what you mean.
13ugh they ruined the dawn theme...
*understandable
05,15he HATED MLP and everything about it. Then he saw Pinkie Pie
Shizuka: Who?
13oh god they ruined this so hard...
ninight all :>
13right... well anyway
Night, Kurra. :)
I started out as a hater. Sort of. I thought my brony friend was alone in his appreciation of the show and was just weird as hell.
Sleep well!
AJIsAwesome: LOVE AND TOLERATE, HATE IS FORBIDDEN, HAY GUIS LOOK AT MY DERPY SHIRT
fluttercry: Pinkie Pie is best converter :O
/me pulls all the snuggly creatures in to the barn fulla hay
night Kurra
Hanako: Yep, that's understandable.
fluttercry: i know someone like that. But how did just seeing a character change them?
g'night Kurra :)
cx
13http://retracked.org/disk2.html get this, and listen to the Underwater World track
I don't let that stuff affect me, though.
Now I'm a fanfiction author. Not a good one, but an author nonetheless.
ninight LT_SKINNY :D
05,15XAX he saw a clip of something on youtube
13also Ice Frontier is pretty well remixed, Lavender Hill not as much
ah.
igot one real brony frind in rl.
I have a few brony friends in real life.
05,15I have 2 and a half
fluttercry: Half?
I got.. two. I turned 'em myself. The one who turned me was an Xbox LIVE firend. One known for being weird.
13i remember having friends
05,15half
fluttercry: Wait, I think I see what you mean.
That sucks, Shizuka
05,15as in he likes the show but he hasn't watched it since S2
hater*
05,15but if you turn an episode on, he'll watch it
Friends are over-rated.
I havent had friends since high school lol
^
^^
05,15All my friends are the ones from high school. I haven't made any in college
My brother is a huge hater. He got me banned from here twice by writing disgusting stuff about "how he loves PokemoN"
I'm trying to make some friends in college atm.
Good Morning ^^
thats good :)
AJIsAwesome: same ^_^
Hi, Arcium. :)
morning Arcium
and good morning Arcium
My college's official (recognized by the university) is somewhere around 25 or something
i cant make new friends.
:D
Jmo, really? But don't you that *sharp intake of breath, deep condescending voice with occasional voice crack* FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC
05,15Then again I'm at a community college soooooooooooo I haven't really been the most talkative person
My brother also drew pe----s on my brony shirts with perm marker. My parents made him buy me new ones, so it ended well, as I was getting big for those shirts anyway. I GOT NEW SIZES!!! :D
morning Arcium
You missed 'know'
.....damnit
KrazyNoobs: lucky you :D
nice KrazyNoobs lol
KrazyNoobs: epic win for you
KrazyNoobs: Thats a good story there :P
He also payed from the shipping from WeLoveFine.com to Australia
So it was a good ending
HA
I rarely talk to anyone, coworkers get a bit of conversation from me, but thats it
:D
Cypresswolf: :P
05,15I miss my old job. I worked at an ice cream stand
05,15best job ever
I bet
Most of the nerds that congregate amongst themselves at my college are haters... I feel so alone :(
Fluttercry: What job do you have now then?
But that made him hate ponies even more, so now I have a ridiculously long password on my computer he could never get so that he will never go onto my account here and f--- around with everypony again. As said, I almost got perma-banned.
05,15It taught me valuable skills like.....making milkshakes and.....scooping ice creams
FIRE!!!
:O fireplace ^_^ so warm
Hate nerds? That's ass backwards...
Hater*
fires
05,15Arcium You're looking at it
fluttercry: ^^
05,15lol this is what I do in my free time
dat fire
rarely talk to my siblings anymore, never call but when they come into town to visit I'm the opposite of my usual self
/me scooted closer to the fire
This is the most action packed video EVAR.
Quick, Spycheck the chat!
/me ducks
Soulless_DCLXVI: It is what it is :/
13how is audio quality?
it burns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel so warm
13not clipping is it
I wasn't complaining
Shizuka: It's good. :)
13awsm
Shizuka pretty good
Sounds good Shizu
Shizuka: sound good
13maxed out sound meter on fmle makes me worried..
I mean, there's fire... EVERYWHERE.. okay, getting tired of using caps. How do you italics?
13but i guess being line 1 it doesn't run into clipping issues
Soulless_DCLXVI: Type /me, and then what you want to say.
/me 13if by italics you mean ctcp action, /me
So fluttercry. What time is it?
/me this is a test
Neat
1312:43am

fluttercry: 7:43pm tuesday what now
13FROM THE WOOOOOOORLD OF TOMOOOORROOOOOOW
i like fire...
Gah, curse you finals!
I can use /italics/
Shizuka: why did you start streaming out of nowhere
/me test me/ test
But I prefer to do *this*
Damn it
05,15Shizuka you have to watch out! In one hour the Earth wil----
texasboykc09: Why not? :3
Is it friday in the world of tomorrow?
Do you have flying cars yet?
Soulless_DCLXVI: /me isn't what you want
13i have to share how awesome this remix is
Now way of italicing only PART of a sentence, eh?
Okay.
Bye every bode :D Schooltime -.-
05,15dat fire.
everybofy#
05,15I miss fire
Bye, Arcium.
Soulless_DCLXVI: You mean like /this/?
everybody#
Bye Arcium :)
Stream a live concert please
er
bya Arcium
05,15can't have fire in an apartment
bye bye arcium
/this/
13some clients interpret /this/ as italics but it depends on the client
05,15well you CAN but it doesn't end well
13lightIRC does not
Still not working, buddy.
/me why are we talking about italics?
13other clients interpret *bold* or _underline_
I just see it as a slash on lightiRC.
When was BronyState made again?
/me because they look cool
13it has always existed
Because I don't want to use caps all the time to emphasize.
13okay i have to share how awesome this mix is
*This* is emphasis, I generally use it instead of italics
Shizuka LOL, I just found the About Us History pages
05,15KrazyNoobs gosh....I wanna say.....March of 2011. I may be wrong
I'll check
Soulless_DCLXVI: Would *this* suit your purposes?
13so sounds pretty lo fi right, early tracker music?
fluttercry May of 2011
05,15Is this the 80s?
Agreed
13okay
I think May 2011, right?
13now behold
Eh, I guess. Italics would be better. But i'll take what I can get.
05,15KrazyNoobs I knew it was one of those m months
05,15Am I living in Drive?
I usually use *this* for roleplay purposes.
13DAT BASS HIT
/me is reading about BronyState's history, rather interested
I'd maim to have dirt floor in the living room with a fire pit in the center! fireplaces are over rated! Just have a shielded grate for the smoke to bellow out above when the fire is going
05,15Worthy of Phill Collins
Vinyl would be proud, Shizuka
05,15Okay yeah this is giving off some serious "Drive" vibes
Oh
/me uses this for roleplay
Why would so many of the original admins leave from this awesome part of the brony community?
Drive... that one TV show with Nathon Fillion?
05,15I use the kick boot for RP
(I doubt I got his name right)
oh you
05,15Soulless_DCLXVI nah it's a crime movie with Ryan Gosling
mhm
Shizuka: what is Ninja-ing
I left for most of S2
KrazyNoobs: RL problems or duties, I guess?
when I came back I didn't recognize folks
05,15Also sounds a lot like Hotline Miami
Ah, and surpisingly I got his *first* name wrong, but his *last* name right.

13this is the theme i was talking about when i said retracked ruined it
I dont really celebrate Halloween anymore... :(
^
I handed out candy last Halloween... kinda killed it for me :D
Bye guys
Cya KrazyNoobs
bye KrazyNoobs
Bye, KrazyNoobs.
AppleBloom: Aw, I found it funny :D
Man, it's funny. I'm 25 and I still trick or treat. Sure, I'm "escorting my nephew" but i get a hefty candy tax.
RaveBrony: Oh I did too, it's just one of those one's where you gotta facepalm it
I haven't trick or treated in years.
AppleBloom: Yeah, true :D
The only candy I really eat during halloween is candy corn.
Love me some candy corn.
Man, I love that stuff. :D
Trick-or-treating is better with friends... but i moved into a very unpopulated area in NY :(
Gotta eat Candy corn one color at a time tho. :3
My neighbors actually have a friend that comes down once a year to celebrate halloween with us.
It's that big for us.
Dang :o
NY to TN
my mom knows the strangest people
That was kinda random dude.
she invited friends over for one late ass games night, they're out there finishing up some Scrabble now
bah, it's 2:35 in the AM
otakon: No Mahjong?
I can be random
Scrabble is fun :D
^
AJIsAwesome: I don't even think she knows how to play it
Can't be a game night without Mahjong. :D
My mom kick my *ass* at Scrabble and pretty much every other word game imaginable.
anyway I lost my taste for Scrabble after my sister beat me with QUAY
FUCKING QUAY
I always play Charades at game nights.
13QUAY
13CHIROPRACTOR
I like Scattergories.
oh God -_-
?
one of them had a bit too much to drink and I had to chase them out of my room -_-
Lolwut!
otakon: That sucks. :D
ploaay metal.
otakon: do what now?
When my father gets super drunk he acts like a monkey and goes picking at my hair =_(\
married with three kids and she's "can I lay with you tonight? :3"
otakon: ohhoho :D
Oh geez, haha
she's just being silly of course
otakon: ......
oooh new tombstone song
Chrysalis: hiya man, how's Britland?
view 233 woo under 303
otakon cold
13you hipster
Chrysalis: BAH! I WANT IT TO BE COLD HERE!
Once, the letter was G and one of the catergories was Music Band. My dad wrote "Gorrilas" thinking he was being funny and writing the wrong name for a band called "The Monkeys". When I said "I'm surprised you know the band, but that's supposed to be a Z, he got confused.
13TAKE MY COLD
13PLEASE TAKE IT
Soulless_DCLXVI: lol
nope:P
13anything higher than 9F is better...
Shizuka: I'll take it
Lol!
Shizuka: blow it east ward
Cold as in...temp... or illness? O.o
13take the two feet of snow while you're at it
Oh
screw snow
I'd love some cold here in the south. :D
my puppy's asleep on my ipad. o.O
snow is horrible
I love snow.
^
k
I Want Snow Here!!!!

AppleBloom: take a picture!
wow, 9F, its 24F here

Babs Seed remix
DAMNIT SHIZU
Its has been RAINING for the past 4 days here in Upstate NY in December!
its snowing here now
RaveBrony: Lucky you! :(
I hate snow. As much as the sociopolitical climate sucks here, I'll take it over the meteorlogical one of the north.
13IT'S OTAKON'S FAULT
.__.
:o
otakon x snow
AJIsAwesome: Nuuu, i want snow darn it! :D
Chrysalis: I'll TAKE IT!
buwah
and then Chrysalis was confused
Chrysalis please let me never see that in art form.
I'd be traumatized.
Shizuka: ?? why is it my fault?
well I got work in the morning, G'night everypony
huh, you know what...
night AppleBloom
tombstones older work was better
Cya AppleBloom
13because it is
Night, AppleBloom.
Peace, AppleBloom
I shouldve been asleep 3 hours ago, lol. Got a class speech assignment today :3
Soulless_DCLXVI: There's someone here named Snow, just not here at the moment.
and a eurobeat upload
view 148 w00t
13you youtube hipster
That makes more sense
13just have to get in under the spam filter cap
oh its a babseed remix
By who?
/me 13can't stand eurobeat
Eurobeat
13it's so monotonous
Ooo!!
I like Eurobeat. .__.
/me runs off to youtube
have you heard the new tombstone?
13it's always the exact same percussion pattern
Wait, I hear a slow Japanese song. Not a Eurobeat Babs seed remix. Do I need to refresh?
Soulless_DCLXVI: Eurobeat's on Youtube.
Soulless_DCLXVI nope
Ooo, im liking it so far <3
im just bein YT hipster watchin the vids before they get popular
I'm aware. But I take your meaning as it's not on the stream at all.
Chrysalis: :D
euch, got to go work
then send phone off to repair
have fun guys
Aw, cya Chrysalis!
enjoy the stream
Bye Chrysalis
and thanks for the stram Shizuka
stream*
Gah, I hate it when my chat crashes.
Hah
Billy mays is gonna kick yo ass.
well im listening to the eva 3.0 ost, and judging by the songs, rule number 1 of eva will be well preserved, there seems to be more "we're screwed"/"worlds about to end" music than battle music even
We still got about a week and a half before that music becomes relevant.
I am of course referring to the Dec 21 2012 bullcrap
oh that
I heard it's happening the 12th
you know, 12/12/12 and all that crap
I thought it was the 21st.
Nah, man. Winter Solstice.
bah it's rubbish
Yeah, the 21st.
Of course it is.
Agreed, otakon.
it's rubbish regardless
But I've been hearing about this date since '99.
Shizuka: Where did you find this? :D
wait, the world is ending 12/12/12? damn, i already bought a bus ticket...
lol
the ticket for that day i mean
I almost wish something would happen. All that build up....
hi
Hi, aniderp|bestcakeever.
hoi aniderp|bestcakeever
okay I hate the NEW NEW Youtube layour
*layout
'Sup, aniderp|bestcakeever
00,10what build up? the wack a doos telling you the world is ending cause some one ran out of space on their calinder?
THAT'S IT
WHY DOES IT KEEP SHOWING MY "What to Watch" and everything else BESIDES THAT?
Fresh Prince? :D
View 276
Man, I've been hearing about this ONE SPECIFIC DATE, since 1999. No other date have I heard so much about, for so long.
hah
it's all bullshit son
Soulless_DCLXVI: what? not even the Y2K bug?
OBVIOUSLY
13except those predictions don't take the gregorian calendar's modifications into account
13the mayan calendar rolled over in like 2006
Man, I heard about Y2K in 1999. That's only one year of build up
Shizuka: so... bullocks?
ahem bollocks?
13eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
Not even, I think I heard about Y2K in October
DAMN YOU EXHAUSTION!
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED!
/me brings up Y2038
12/12/12 is the date of gaк rapture, accept your lord and you will live
lol
twilight_squirtle, the date is supposedly 12/21/12. And as Sumica pointed out, there's really nothing to it other than the Mayan calander running out of space.
Bigcheese don't you even start dude.
It's a real problem.
the hell is Y2038?
good question
13yeah 2038 is the big actual problem
Buytoast: when the unix time stamp overflows.
13the 32bit unix timestamp overflow
Kandarihu: oh its 21, i guess my bus ticket for the 12th wont go to waste then
love this song
Y2k was only a problem for crappy systems.
00,10piffff unix
Shizuka: so what does that mean?
crap
That only crappy people used in 2000.
00,10it's not like we need to lock to door in a hury
only 26 years before that
Hey everyone! Feels like its been forever since I was last here
13uh every system in the world that uses unix timestamps needs to be using the 64bit version by then
Actually, the Mayan Calendar is one of like 100 "prophecies". Of course they're all bullocks. But that don't change that I've had the date drilled into my head for 13 years.
Hi, oni_link. :)
The 2038 problem is deeply embedded in protocols.
hiya oni_link we're talking about DOOMSDAYS!
AJIsAwesome: howdy!
Soulless_DCLXVI: bollocks, a bullock is a young bull
otakon: oh goody :3
Ohai oni_link :P
hey AdamTheDuck_ ! :)
And all 32bit code uses 32bit time by default.
I think before that the longest I had thought about a date in the future was Halo: Reach's release date.
Shizuka: What song is this? :)
Before Y2038, we have to deal with the Fiscal Cliff and Solar Maximum. That's gonna be this next year.
13lilium
13elfen lied OP
Thanks otakon
Alright thanks. :)
elfen lied is AWESOME.
But back to the point.
13i doubt even late night mane chat is mature enough for elfen lied
We need 64bit miliseconds.
whoa haha
300k years
I always see that on my netflix queue
And milisecond accuracy.
13much much longer than that
Shizuka: I'm too exhausted for that can of worms
13300 million
Shizuka: must have been nanoseconds I was thinking of then.
13like 297,000,000 plus change
okay the HELL is Solar Maximum?
00,10whats the worst that could happen Shizuka
otakon: when the sun kills everyone!!!!!!
No clue
Shizuka: the universe goes back to 1970
13for 32 bit time overflow? all systems still using 32bit timestamp will think it's 1900
Bigcheese: yay... well that's not supposed to happen for about 3 billion years
00,10no I ment if you showed Elfin
13oh elfen lied?
Shizuka: nipples!
13one of the characters has a stepfather that rapes her
Sumica: Chat freaks out, and we all go to bed whimpering
Shizuka: .......
13did i mention the character is no more than ten?
That too.
Shizuka: THE TABOO!
13she runs away and that's the important part of the arc
00,10oh is that all
Wow. :S
well shit. okay
Sumica: no, that's the PROLOGUE
So.. Bigcheese... in 3 billion years the universe will revert to 1970CE?
Shizuka: which girl is that...
13no the prologue is
I totally forget.
We have 26 years to deal with it. If Solar Maximum does blast the whole world to the stone age, I can probably guess we'll wait until the last 3 years before we take it seriously, and it'll be just like Y2K all over again.
13the first six minutes are a naked girl utterly destroying high ranking military
The prologue is a naked girl walking around killing everyone.
this chat can barely handle tits from penn and teller
13where we learn the human body holds a hundred gallons of high pressure blood
00,10should have some higgarushi or how ever you spell it too
Shizuka: with invisible wire blades
otakon: vectors
Well either way, I feel like I should watch this with you or on my own . It just keeps showing up
Shizuka: that's a standard anime trope
oni_link: don't go alone
She uses huge invisble arms
13elfen lied is a good series that brings up important points
Eh, I don't really like that show.
Soulless_DCLXVI: with blades
13just does so in a very violent manner
otakon: lol why not?
Shizuka: with blades :3
I highly reccomend watching elfen lied.
13speaking of anime i should block out three hours and finish our series soon
It's a good anime. If a bit sad.
I can't do sad
Grave of the Fireflies ruined me
13haibane will have you bawling by the end
RUINED ME
00,10Law of Hemoglobin Capacity
00,10The human body contains over 12 gallons of blood, sometimes more, under high pressure.
lol what?
Yeah, since becoming a brony I've been on a strict happy media diet.
00,10law of anime
did you TV Tropes?
yer makin me squirm man
could be worse
could be body horror
/me shudders
13oh it touches on that too
O_O
13speaking of we need to watch akira
NOOOOOOOOOO
Sumica did you get your info from the fact sphere?
oh God that last scene
00,10Law of Transient Romantic Unreliability
00,10Minmei is a bimbo.
SO BUCKED UP
Shizuka: Oh, THAT scene.....
13KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Geez, that scene was......interesting.
AJIsAwesome: yeah probably the most twisted body horror scene in anime
Closest I've seen in squick is Strait Jacket near the end
i like anime when they cry.
Shame on me, the only time I saw Akira was on Sci-Fi network, and it's only the second half of the movie.
00,10Law of Sonic Amplification, First Law of Anime Acoustics
00,10In space, loud sounds, like explosions, are even louder because there is no air to get in the way.
Kandarihu: good times, good times
I miss Saturday Anime
;_;
Anime physics hurt mah brain
Project A-ko was my first "real" anime
otakon: Toonami has anime.
Goddamn what a fun movie
00,10I streamed Strait Jacket here once
AJIsAwesome: it's not the same, plus they keep rerunning stuff
it was interesting
Sumica: What's the synopsis?
otakon: True.
Sumica: the eyes man, THE EYES!
00,10heh
00,10very akira at the end
you should show it again sometime sumi
00,10I am thinking if my body can handle it this friday. we Do appleseed
AJIsAwesome: okay, magic is real but it causes pollution. If you practice magic without a special suit on, the pollution turns you into a hideously deformed monster that only wants to kill. If the suit is damaged while performing magic, same thing.
13someone's been playing thaumcraft
otakon: ._______.
That magic sucks
AJIsAwesome: yeah, we get to see it in full detail at the end, with the guy SCREAMING before he goes completely insane "KILL ME!"
.......
What anime is this?
apparently it can happen slowly too with just build up
Soulless_DCLXVI: Strait Jacket
Ah
CTHULHU: oh me too! that show is twisted
Steampunk meets Wizards meets Godzilla kind of
13elfen lied is by no means a light series
I don't remember that.
Shizuka: I don't like it, reminds me of another show for some reason
00,10but yeah there is some hard core gore in it AJIsAwesome
Akira??? :o
Sumica: Hmm, well if that's the case it's probably something I'd not watch. :D
13marimba rules
AJIsAwesome: yeah one demon dessicates it's victims, another is some mass of lard that shoots lasers from it's body
00,10seeing as the show opens with a Dr going on a rampage in a hosptal
I'm wondering when "The Thing" will get an anime treatment
yeah he's using Sorcery for surgery
his Cast busts
he mutates in his suit and then rampages
Sumica: This is an movie, yes?
00,10OAV but yeah
*a
yeah the thing is in that world, sorcery is only dangerous to those PRACTICING IT
00,10well and every one in the area when they go out of control
if you're a normal person, the Malediciton(magical pollution) has no affect on you
13rasse ra rasse ra rasse rasse rasse ra
Sumica: well yeah but that goes without saying
Shizuka: ??
oh and apparently it can be passed on
Whoa, this is a neat song
13main theme for akura
13er
13akira
one character is the half demon child of the protags former mentor
The movie?
13passing into that dead tired range..
13ja
Sonds Zebrican... uh, I mean African.
Soulless_DCLXVI: lol
That's definitely a good thing
YOU'VE WATCHED TOO MUCH MLP WHEN
You equate Zebras to Africans
^^^
When I swear I saw the Mare in the Moon last night :P
Nah man, read too much fanfiction.
you say YOU'VE WATCHED TOO MUCH MLP WHEN
Soulless_DCLXVI: you poor soul
you know you watch mlp too much when you casually say anypony
:)
damnit K-On! is cute as hell
Hey, I enjoy it.
You know you watch too much MLP when
When you say everypony in a normal conversation
^^^
I do that
lol
I don;t
You follow Pinkies cupcake instructions AND THEY WORK
*don't
It slips occasionally.
otakon: o.o I have to test that one day
It bends here
otakon: Project A-ko was my first too. XD

13ossifer dammit drunk i'm not god!

How about Twilight Spritzer?
I LOVED the Gooby Berry Sundae in the Spongebob movie. I KNEW it was referencing alcohol, which made me laugh even more. :D

Pinkie Pie...
Yeah Ill take a number 4 with curly fries. Sir, this is a bank and we're closing. Extra cheese!!
Rainbow Daiquiri
I can't think of a booze nick name for Pinkie
otakon: The scene where Spongebob and Patrick are stuffinf themselves with sundaes, and they end up passing out in a somewhat drunken stupor.
*stuffing
AJIsAwesome: oh
hold on a second
Hey, Nightmare Moonshine!
By the way, would the Spongebob movie be an A or B movie? :)

Wait, the fireplace was here for a whole hour? I've been here longer than I thought.
You guys are fun to talk to

AdamTheDuck: you're implying i had one in the first place.
If I had a better PC I doubt I'd mind being a streamer.
I honestly have no life anyway.
otakon: 63% jellification and rising
Not that I mind. I prefer it that way.
Good for you Soulless_DCLXVI
XAX: you have to get into the sun before it's too late!

NENUDJUS: you spelled it right :P
I liked L alot more
oni_link: why you have ?
Okay, so Light is not L. Gotcha. In that case, yeah, I like Light too.
NENUDJUS: Oh I didn't understand what you meant by light. Like if you literally meant light or if it was the character but I get it now.
Thats a paddelin
oh ok
Yeah, that's why i had asked for context earlier.

Soulless_DCLXVI: or you can use /nick and then type the new nickname

Element of loyalty is best element of harmony because it's carried by dashie and its shaped like a lightning

me*
Magic is best element, because it's unique.
I used to like Dashie alot, infact she was the reason I got into the show but I liked how funny and goofy pinkie is
I like to laugh and be silly :3
U is my best Element
I no longer like Dashie in canon. She's rather abrasive.
I used to like Twilight like you. Then i took a rainboom in my knee
Ugh

hahaha random XD
Some Day
Phase4: magnets, HOW DO THEY WORK
MadSurge: The magnetic flux density (also called magnetic B field or just magnetic field, usually denoted B) is a vector field. The magnetic B field vector at a given point in space is specified by two properties:Its direction, which is along the orientation of a compass needle.Its magnitude (also called strength), which is proportional to how strongly the compass needle orients along that direction.In SI units, the strength of the magnet
Dat answer :D
haha
not sure if scholar or google search....
im back back back
:O STREAM
A good bar magnet may have a magnetic moment of magnitude 0.1 A•m2 and a volume of 1 cm3, or 1×10−6 m3, and therefore an average magnetization magnitude is 100,000 A/m.
Alright!!! Stream time!
STREEEAAAAAAAAM

KrazyNoobs: Polka Face
SillyFilly64 is silly :3
Starchaser, I am guessing that, like many other shows, they procrastinated, and that they only had time to make 13 episodes for now, but they are probably scrambling up more episodes (not 13 more, maybe 5 or 6 more) to show halfway through the gap between seasons. Many other shows have done that, I am not all too sure about MLP:FiM though. I hope that's the case
me too KrazyNoobs
moo
meep

idk D:
Well. The suns rising, so I should head. And I hadn't been here too long, and my monitor is ****. Anyway, 'night... er... day.
i think they have to pay but they get it sooner
aniderp|bestcakeever: What would you be doing at nintendo if you worked for them? :P
the sun is up for me now... means that my assignment is do rather soon... time to actually work on it....
giving tours!
They do tours?
i mean.. working on zelda games
idk ;_;
The Zelda games are made in Japan. :D
So you'd live in Japan?
i know
yes
i would write character names
and what they would say!
lol have fun. They eat mostly seafood there. And not the good kind.
aniderp|bestcakeever: The english stuff's done in the US, so if you'd be writing the dialogue, it'd be for the localization of the games.
so..
i would have to write in alot of languages?
No, just English. If you're in Japan, you'd be writing Japanese. =/
lol dat Mario death ditty
Hi
maybe i would be better as a voice actor as sound effects
i fail ;_;

Hello everypony
Yay seaponies!
ohai Ponies47
Ohai Ponies47
Gold_Demona: you should work there with me also!
muffins we will get muffins!
Hehe, had my first glass of wine :$
aniderp|bestcakeever: Nah, I don't think they'd want me. I'm not good enough at anything. :P
it was nice :3
well full glass anyway
Hi, Ponies47. :)
AdamTheDuck: What kind of wine, and with what food? =D
I have no idea :$
lol
but Gold_Demona we will have muffins!
Well it was champagne, but apparently not champagne
Lightweight.
AdamTheDuck: Do you at least know if it was a white wine or a red wine? :D
White
heh
White wines are nice :>
was like champagne*
I think I prefer red though
back from breakfast!
Champagne is its own animal
Welcome back Dark92Enigma
It's like wine, but not
how's your morning been, everypony?
can i tell you people something?
Been good Dark92Enigma
Phase4 I'm in! :D
sure aniderp|bestcakeever
aniderp|bestcakeever, go ahead I guess :P
i had whiskey before
icccck
What kind?
idk
I've always wanted to try whiskey
i felt like sipping before shooting it down
dumb idea
never sipping shots again
Never sip liquor
never
Dat feel when you didn't fall asleep till about 1:00 AM and get up at 6:30 AM ;~;
not to try it?
/me licks Jmo :P
No
Never
that was my mistake
liquor is to taste with the back of your mouth, not the front
Hiiiiiiiiiiii guyssss :3
Ponies47: THat feeling when you have insomnia and didn't sleep at all. ;~;
Sipping makes you taste with the front
xx
well then i shot it down but didnt finish it
i had water...
after.. and i was shaking
AJIsAwesome, hehe, I thought you went to sleep a while ago :$
AdamTheDuck: I tried to, couldn't.
aniderp|bestcakeever, shaking? .-.
shaking? O_o
Damn, now I'm not so sure about trying whiskey :<
Whiskey is good if you have the right kind
yea after my first shot i ever had i was shaking a bit
i was joking when i said me and well i got one o.O
lol
aweful
I'll start playing pony music on here
btw im underage D:
aniderp|bestcakeever, so am I :P
i was 19.. before i turned 20
Yeah, if you're drinking liquor straight, you're supposed to just rush it down your throat and enjoy the burn and the aftertaste. :D
now.. gotta wait till sep 17th 2013
got it burned a bit..
strong o.O
The only way you're allowed to sip liquor is if it's mixed in something, like soda or in a cocktail drink.
i will promise you all something
i wont drink until im legal age
Good for you
My husband did the same thing
/me pats aniderp|bestcakeever on the head "good boy"
girl*
I was a bad girl and was drinking since my teens. :P
Hehe, I think I'll break the law again maybe once or twice again for the hell of it :$
i will be a good girl and wont drink any more alchohol things until im legal age
And my mother provided my drinks. :D
aniderp|bestcakeever, derp. Sorry :$
Go back to bread Ponies47 :P
:D
and damnit frame that tumblr image I sent you
I have to go to school shortly =_=
Well, my lighter drinks. Any time I had liquor, I was out with my friends or my husband back when we were still dating. :D
guess what im gonna do when i turn 21 :D
aniderp|bestcakeever, drink? :$
yes!
aniderp|bestcakeever: drink until you puke? :D
but that means i cant take my meds that night..
What I did when I turned 21: Had some cake
Yeah, alcohol + meds = really really bad
# Cider cider cider cider #
on mood meds :\
Hard cider! Yeah!
I still have some cider, come to think of it...
Too bad I ran out of liquor. :<
you think i should wait till my parents home that night or?
I usually have some rum lying around...
All this talk about booze when there is a 15 year old in the room XD
What's rum like?
should i drink during the day
Ponies47, I'm only a year older than you :P
or wait
I would say you shouldn't drink at all, but if you do, don't get drunk
AdamTheDuck: It tastes like a sweeter form of whiskey
AdamTheDuck, You are? O.O
i would end up in the hospital if i got drunk
since meds
Ponies47, how old did you think I was? :$
Why didn't anyone say hi to me ;AAA;
Yeah
but whenever i drink.. i will skip my meds
TwilightSonata: because chat is busy. :P
I don't see the point in getting drunk, but there's alot out there that can taste really nice
Hello TwilightSonata o.o
AdamTheDuck, Idk. Never thought of dat really :p
good enough?
AdamTheDuck: insert Fluttershy reference here
consult your physician
Vivix: Getting drunk can be fun if you don't overdo it
00,02XD
Dark92Enigma, hehe :$
Hi guys, I'm back
00,02reliable snapshot overflow
I only had a glass Vivix :P
:(
lol
Did anyone hear my smile song?
Hehe
Gold_Demona: i will be careful when i drink
I don't like getting drunk, but- each their own
aniderp|bestcakeever: Please do.
I like the taste of vodka, but never had enough to get drunk
since i on meds
aniderp|bestcakeever, wise decision.
meaning i would skip my meds that night
Vivix: Getting drunk at parties is awesome :D
aniderp|bestcakeever: Yeah, I'd say be careful anyway, but you be extra careful.
I hate parties-
well, unless they're concerts or small
Plus it gives you an excuse to get off with really hot guys without feeling like a slut >>>
Ha
lol
Parties are awesome! D:
I'm too much of a nerd to know what it's like to attend a big party. =P
I don't go to parties or anything really so you guys don't have to worry about me doing underage drinking.
Dat Jaymo
I don't feel comfortable with being drunk, It freaks me out
Ohai Mojay! =D
I don't even drink at concerts, because I want to enjoy the music fully
I disconnected, what did you say Adam?
Just "Dat Jaymo"
No. In response to my question,.
00,02steam is not designed to download as much as i'm asking it to
dat jaymoo
Jmo, you had a question?
Why are you under-age drinking?
Phase4 I was disconnected for some odd reason... :(
don't any of you guys go to parties ever?
00,02KrazyNoobs, 'reliable snapshot overflow'?
Phase4 Exactly
wut
TwilightSonata, not often.
00,02genshi is very hard on the server
00,02tends to break
Jmo, because I'm bored :3
TwilightSonata: I grew up a nerd and a social reject. Parties are a foreign entity to me. =/
No, that is a shit excuse.
Okay... any other good ideas for servers?
Don't you try feeding that to me.
Phase4 Are you going to continue to play?
/me feeds Jmo a shit excuse :3
I don't really like parties, but I do enjoy concerts, but they aren't really parties
/me sits on Jmo 's head :3
00,02KrazyNoobs, yeah
00,02trying being the operative word
Jmo, don't think I'll be drinking anymore anytime soon anyway :P
What server shall we do, Phase4?
00,02i'm breaking steam right now
Yeah no, I'm disappointed.
00,02KrazyNoobs, try that one again
Have you ever tried vsh_dr?
You're always disappointed Jmo :P
Mojay is not impressed?
00,02KrazyNoobs, nope
Like Puppet Dema?
/me pokes jaymoo
00,02still wondering what to do with my 600GB of free space
Phase4 It is the best of all levels. There is hale, and he sets of traps while the red team runs down an obstacle course.
Phase4: Fill it with ponies! =D
00,02KrazyNoobs, Oh
00,02i thought it was the other way round
Gold_Demona, eww ponies >_>
00,02vsh on a deathrun map
00,02i've played death run
pffft. Ponies
Phase4 It is awesome.
00,02it is, but i allways die early
Phase4 Okay, I'll rejoin that server I was just on, okay?
Ha, ponies <_<
I mean porn >_>
<_<
Phase4 most people tend to rush through the level. If you know the traps, and if you are patient, you can probably win.
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Gold_Demona: you are naughty D:
talking about ponies
tsk tsk
00,02KrazyNoobs, they just switched to a dr_ map XD
AWESOME
00,02dr_tantrum
aniderp|bestcakeever: I mentioned earlier that my brain's in the gutter today. :P
I LOVE THAT ONE
I'm cold ;~;
Yes... 600 gigs of ponies... <_< >_>
00,02which needs to be downloaded >_<
My favs are vsh_dr_trollrun and vsh_dr_time_travel_v4

you need your brain washed out with some zelda!
/me snuggles against Ponies47 :P

AdamTheDuck: That's a lot of ponies
00,02after this i might find a deathrun server
00,02gentelmans estate runs a few
I know the perfect one. I am an admin of one of the vsh_dr servers.
00,02: D
Thank you AdamTheDuck :P
/me dies
Phase4 Well... I used to be, but I was a jerk to people, and was immediately revoked... :'(
Phase4: But it is a very good server. If you leave, I will go there, and you can follow if you wish.
Welcome back AJIsAwesome :3
Thanks, AdamTheDuck. :)

Now to play the pedobear song
08,01now, the question is: do i use it to pay off my student loan, or do i use it as the start of my "cello upgrade" fund?
pay da billz
I would say student loan.
08,01i'd need abotu £1000 more for the cello i want, and that's after trade in
yepp
Jmo, ^
do loan
I'd say Student Loans, to be honest.

Pay those off first.
We are all boring
xD
Pay da loan
08,01hm
Barbetos, ikr :D
when's the closure on the loan?
Ohai Jmo
00,02i dont have a pound key on my keyboard
08,01Phase4: curently, my loan stands at about £40,000
00,02interets?
traxie
08,01so i don't think £2000 is going to make all that much difference
00,02intrest
05Phase4
00,02spelingf il
Alright, you made it sound like you were gonna be able to pay the whole thing off.

Im sorry but i have to not like it KrazyNoobs :C
Awwwww...
Sooooo, "pay the bills" ;3
xD
Wow. Sound sexual.
Hey, can someone mirror the recent Vinyl Scratch piece by Wrek on an image sharing website for me? I was really wanting to show someone, but can't access dA from here. If so, I can send a link to where you can mirror it temporarily.
That's what I think I'd do, unless the loan was really pressing or worrysome, but as long as it's not
If that's OK with you, Wrek.
08,01i love my cello, but i'd also love to have a 200 year old one
KrazyNoobs stahp, please.
Any specific in mind?
08,01not really; it depends on what the various instrument shops have in
I'm playing Smile now
08,01but i'd be looking at around the £6000 range
run phase run
Teleportaled!
08,01£3000 from my current one traded in, £3000 cash
;_;
Hm, sounds like a good price range, not used to cello prices

And can anyone? (see message at hh:49)
well, you want something sturdy and high quality to protect something at such a value
08,01mind you, we're talking about 11 years since i bought the thing
/me slaps SafariMonkey around a bit with a large trout
Do you mean on Imgur SafariMonkey?
Hey Jmo
Or an actual mirror site?
Not imgur, can't access that either
08,01Barbetos: aye; i was only 13
08,01wo 12 years ago, in fact
I feel old
/me 08,01has the best parents in the world

08,01i was 13, and heading off to be a pupil at the UK's most prestigious music school
I can gramrz

08,01so they went and spent £2000 on a cello for me
Jmo: storetime low; 30min should be fine

08,01i was only there for a year, but what a difference it made on my whole outlook on music
Pinkamina killing people with a fish!
I did not finish college but it change my outlook on everything.
Needless to say I am not a crack addict now.
Hehe
Yay college!
I went to a one year performing music school, changed a lot, and made me realize I need a shrink to help with social issues
I went to a private university, so my "college experience" was REALLY different from what most people have. :P
Now all you need is pony
Why did you go to college to look at privates?
=o
dat sad Sweetiebell :C
Isn't that why anyone goes to college?
lol Barbetos, not those kind of privates. :D

Oh. Huh.
/me 08,01is basically at scotland's version of Oxford
08,01in fact, we ranked higher than Oxford last year for Computer Science
You make me not want to be in murica any more
well.. Actually I already felt that way but still
I blame texas
I've had this graphic design degree for 6 years, and I haven't really done squat with it cuz I suck at graphic design. :P
00,02"...focused primarily on building circuits via an Object Oriented approach that bundles collections of gates into Java objects"
00,02the one thing electronics does not need is another hdl based of a crap programing language
00,02we've already got a dialect of pascal
00,02(techinically vhdl is based of ada, which is based of pascal, but still)
I make circuit boards so you can watch tv and use computers.
Also tablets
I want to study animal behaviour- but I'm not 100% sure
I think that is the rough translation
Not what I do personally.
I am just in IT. XD
I maek artz! 8D
I wub artz!
I've found that after leaving college, what you are good at, and what oyu want to do are two different things.
Barbetos: True dat
00,02and aparently verification and design are split into seperate languages
00,02one day i'll design a better hdl
00,02these are all crap
Well I guess I should take a shower.
and get ready for work
But then bronystate happened.

sense phase4 stream
When they really had not
And then the supposed hot fix did not work, if say, the customer reinstalled it to try and fix it
Panda cloud was not all the good either when we changed to that,
expensive and crappy
00,02Wrek, tell them you have a crashdump, if they dont ask for it then i'd just uninstall it
The panda hate is strong with me wow. Ima shut up now
00,02its likely a rare issue, they kinda need it

I think we only have !cd in here
So silent
Did chat die?
Everybody ded :(
:C
That is sad :(
Gold_Demona: why do you frown? I just joined
I am sad now. T^T
Chat is ded Sylandest T^T
Sylandest: noone is talking :(
Ish so sad ;_;
C'est Impossible!
I will restore it
I did it yesterday, and by Celestia's beard, I shall do so again!
lol Celestia's beard
on a different note, Gold_Demona, how are you today? :)
we will never know
Gold_Demona: ooh! I did that with my music, and repeat it every so odd occasion with new music
Gold_Demona: I'm doing well, myself. I have an exam this morning in Sociology, and am currently stuffing my face for energy, lol
Have to remove songs until I have less than 7 hours worth. XD
Gold_Demona: well, bugger me, thats a lot! :D What all sorts are you including?
oh hai Vivix
haya southern horse
Among others
Vivix: howdy indeed! :) How are you today?
Sylandest: kick that exam's ass!
Gold_Demona: Goodness, you have a wide list!
I'm good :3 yourself?
MadSurge: I shall! Sexuality and society this time
/me noms mushroom
Sylandest: I like to keep my music varied so I don't get bored. :>
Vivix: I'm good as well, stuffing my face full of food, and studying notecards
hehe
What's your field?
Gold_Demona: As do I. Being eclectic is handy, no?
Indeed
Vivix: I'm actually an English major, focused in literature. Sociology is my minor.
I study how people work and feel and think, and then I write about them :D
Nice
Sylandest: Oooh literature! Which author do you like the most?
Human studies are interesting though
MadSurge: Far too many to count! XD Should I perhaps try a specific genre?
Vivix. You aren't studying it.
Vivix: Oh, indeed. But you ponies are by far the most intriguing specimens I've uncovered yet
Sylandest: nah, I have maaaaany favorites too
/me beats Jmo ;__;
Hehe, I bet we are
Especially with being a new and still forming community
>_>
MadSurge: One of my favorites in the Sci-fi/fantasy genre is Jim Butcher, author of the Dresden Files. Tell me somepony's heard of him.
I've heard of him.
yes!
I only said that to make you feel better.
Sylandest: I heard of him, never read the Dresden Files though
MadSurge: They're wicked good. Give them a read some time. The first book is "Storm Front".
Sylandest: I have. My one friend raves about Dresden Files all the time
Gold_Demona: He is right to! They're bloody brilliant!
she
She!
:$
But, a very enjoyable series. They even tried to convert it to tv, like they did with Game of Thrones. Alas, it fell through. Too early, and too far away an approach
Italy had many many many brilliant writers, not just Dante :D
MadSurge: eeeyup, they did. We read Dante for class, funny enough
05hmm
oh hai Wrek
I revived the chat for you
you're welcome \:3/
hey look, human is something doing with purple pony cutiemark - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eje8gp9shsM&t=0m43s
You didn't do shit Syl :P
I've never read Dante- probably should
Jmo: I made the effort! :P
Sylandest: Inferno is fun to read, unfortunately Purgatorio and especially Paradiso are more for poetry lovers
I love to read, but I'm a bit cought up in like-- fanfiction and indie fiction. Much less purple and "crime novels"
You only make effort in certain places.
Hohoho.
Vivix: see my answer to Sylandest :D
Vivix: What MadSurge said just before you.
hahaha... i can't read :D
Vivix: I used to write fanfiction, myself. Then /)college(\
hehe
Yeah, Dante's inferno is the one I would probably pick up
well, actually i can
Dante's Inferno <3
ouo: I would hope so, its a vital skill
but- I've gotten a distaste for purple, and sadly a lot of Norwegian fiction is full of it- and what isn't full of it tend to be 90% crime novels
Vivix: purple?
Overly descriptive and poetic
Sylandest, yeup just little asdf ref i did here :P
Vivix: Have you tried breaching into the adventure/drama genre? I've read several good stories there
Vivix: aaah, purple prose
ouo: I caught it~ :)
yeah
noo, but that's kind of what I want- fantasy adventure-
Vivix: Might I recommend the Dragonlance series?
I mean, in my twisted top 10 list, FoE is over Lotr, so that says some about my taste I suppose
/me googles
Vivix: fyi, mystery novels are called "yellows" in Italy
Stream!
Dat Gmod :D
hi
ooh, and stream lives even
yellows? Hmm, I like colour words
hot damn, im good
DAT SKYPE
stream
Ooh, it's eh hm DnD ish?
How is LOTR twisted?
HOW.
Puta merda :D
twisted list, not twisted books
Vivix: not really, but it has that feel. I assure you though, its very good :)
YOU ARE TWISTED.
It sounds interesting- reading the wiki article on it now
Gold_Demona: I told you I'd do it! Look at the chat now! I even brought stream to life
Phase4: hi
Vivix: nooooo, spoilers, noooooooooo
Sylandest: LOL, so you did. :D
noo nono
only reading the eh- header
bsod
sfm
Fantasy with a lot of world building- sounds like my kinda thing
Vivix: you're welcome~ :)
danke :3
/me slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
but yeah- FoE topped Lotr for me- Lotr was one of my favourite books from childhood
COW FACE :D
but- FoE had gay romance and ultimate sacrifice- it made me cry where lotr didn't
Vivix: If I would recommend another, I'd say to try the Colour of Magic
MadSurge: hi
Hi wipergone2!
what is this :D
First book of Discworld?
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Sif.
/me bites Jmo
You bite me again and I'll take you away.
I also skipped the elven court in lotr book <,<
so long
SHAME ON YOU.
;__; I'll stop biting
I was a kiiid
and it was like--2 chapters of legalese
Hello everypony!
Excuses.
I know-
I should reread it
Vivix: lol, "Legalese"
but-- I'd rather reread foe <,<
Hehehe
You will re-read LOTR and you'll like it.
I don't remember much of it, but I remember it being confusing
Now.

Sometimes I worry how fast this fandom cranks shit out
Chat is ded
so dead
Not big surprise
Very dead.
Hi Meanwhile
'Lo.
Meanwhile in the league of villains!
ding
still recovering from playing GTA4. kids keep screaming "Yamoon" ... i need tylenol
The fuck is Yamoon
thats what i've asling them
asking*
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1E8FXpH3Es
Luna damn it wake up chat
It's not "ya mom"?
sorry, suffering with the fking headache atm
cant remember
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTtMgdrh-Bk
/me drops the USS Ronald Reagan on thelonepony|School's flank to make him forget about his headache :D
So whos the orange and blue maned pony in the pictures?
well that done happened :|
SpadeKyurem: i think its Val...right?
Actually I think Val is the one with the trident
nope wait nvm :$
well i got some dishes to do, so brb
....I'm so lonley
I'm so cold
/me eats a grapefruit though :9
how can you not like the cold
you're abnormal
hey guys
The cold sucks man!
yhello
o shit
its 4:45
Buytoast, you're abnormal if you don't want it to be the Caribbean errday |3
bah, that shit's too hot
plus you'd have monkeys pissing you off every day
Carribean is waay too hot
but--something in between would be nice
at least with the cold you can warm up with a blanket at night
That's what the Caribbean sea is for, duh: :O :)
if it's too hot you're outta luck
That's true
Nah, you just get in the ocean!
and blankets are cosier than the beach
And spray yourelf with Canadian squirt guns and things
Your elves, yourself, everyone!
ocean has seaweed
/me squirts Kurra with squirtgun at winter
so whats up guys
beach is also always full of kids and weird old men
We're having cold heat debate.
cold is better
Pff, y'all have no idea at all.
wish it'd start snowing here
heat is better. (sorta)
aint seen a flake
Finally snowed here last week
Go in the snow yeh? You get snow everywhere, and then it freezes, and then you have to melt it, and thne you still have to dry it and that takes all day
send that shit my way
otherwise we're probably gonna end up waiting until february for snow
plus shoveling snow is great
Snow is great because you can sit inside and look at it, all warm and fuzzy by the fire
Get wet in the heat, and oh it's refreshing and not only that you can wetmane all day at everyone if you want, it's just better. </jeremycoltson>
so no stream then
...well okay, the cold is good excuse to keep warm with snuggling.... c.c hmm.
and if its nows at night, and noone has been outside, it looks crazy idyllic
so whats up Dark92Enigma
alexxm i'm fine, but my middle brother just beat me up
how come Dark92Enigma
alexxm he wanted to throw a shovel next door, and i prevented him to do so, then he punched me in the back several times
YOOOOOOUTUUUBE

our only salvation is to burn the house.
Return them to the cinders from which they came.
Screw that, wub them back to where they came from
Screw that, burn it.

This cannot possibly go wrong.
At all.
No way.
anyways, why hasnt hte frontpage been updated?
we are so screwed
11,02That's the spirit Meanwhile!

And by that I mean of course that this is the worst idea ever.

I do have to side with Meanwhile, the traffic is going to suuuuuuuuuck!

aw yeah, new parts are ordered. should be able to make it into planetside on friday
/me slaps Bronysith upside the head with a cinderblock
Professionals would be one of the furthest words I'd think of.
NO
fuck you, machine god, i will win!
Bronysith your message could be sent to the exec commite, want to be hunted by many many many people?
plugs
11,02You see...being a professional brony is a tough position to achieve. It requires a degre in it and a minimum of 10+ years experience before attaining a good job for it.
bronies havent existed for that long

It also requires a complete understanding of italian food.
silly SuperBrony64

You know just what to say
13but only warning level and up, i don't want to hear the boring infospam

http://i.imgur.com/QvXL5.jpg
13yuh huh
Shizuka why not just pass warning to the event system
11,02NU-HUH
and let the other listeners ignore the warning
i like how the top machinegun is controlled by a playstation controller
must be easier than iterating finding the SB listener
13that would be eventSystem.publish("OI YOU STARTIN MATE", WARNING);
13duh
everyone knows that Shizuka loves the asuka
Stop startin'.

11,02YOUR FACE
SuperBrony64: IT WAS PAIN!
Go back to sleep anyway.
Make me. Without force.
/me waits
Anyway! Back to playing WoW till steamies
11,02Bronies have a way of making others do stuff without nothing more than saying a few words.
People are wasting money trying to find out who Mona Lisa was, why do we waste money on this shit?
He can't make me to back to sleep. Only I can.
I must take off. See you guys later!
/me glomps Everlasting_Joy "oh no you dont"
11,02WOAH THERE COWBOY
bye Everlasting_Joy
Meanwhile: kill yourself already
11,02Finding out who Mona Lisa was is a groundbreaking scientific moment.
Do you even know what the Mona Lisa is?
I say "I'm a brony" in public. No fucks to be given.
11,02That one painting...of the...thing
Yea I do but they dont need to analyze everything
Serious question.
yes Meanwhile?
I already asked and it wasn't aimed at you.
11,02The painting of the young lady that Leonardo DiVinci painted...I think he did it...
oh nvm :$
The woman posed for the painting, thats all anyone needs to fucking know
Leonardo da Vinci, but close enough.
The guy from Titanic is a painter too?
dats dicaprio
:D
Well he painted the lady like a French girl in the movie, so...
Woah what the hell, a 7 and 11 year old held up a woman at gun point
In a church parking lot
The fuck people
wat?
Fucking kids these days.
Just came on the news just a second ago
Fluffy: was just thinking that
HOW DID A SEVEN YEAR OLD KID GET A GOD DAMN GUN!
Where was this?
Portland Oregon
SpadeKyurem: everything makes sense now
Well there you go then.
Is Oregon that messed up?
I saw on the news yester day a mother and a father drove their daughter to a bus stop to beat up another kid and THEY CHEERED HER ON
Oh. My. God
I hate humanity so much...
SuperBrony64
SpadeKyurem: lets move to equestria?
SpadeKyurem: what da hell
Well here we can't get eaten by a hydra or petrified by a cockatrice :s
^
thats why you stay in ponyville
or canterlot
instead of wandering into the everfree forest
Bronysith: better to be molested than eaten, eh?
MadSurge: duh
at least molestia wont hurt you if you dont fight back
Equestria is a bad place to live
Every week some shit goes down
i dont care
Either some monster,ancient artifact, some evil god
its worth it if i get to be with molestia
haha
Not to mention the citizens are jerks
Bronysith: Cant argue with that I live there
same SpadeKyurem
anyone here ever go to disney world?
hell yea
unviversal studios is better though
You know what I hate? When the ride says no flash pictures and some chucklefucks still do it
chucklefucks?
SpadeKyurem i went to the one in paris
Bronysith: <.< at least disney takes care of their rides
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Drawing Training Ground - Episode Editions
SpadeKyurem: at least universal is much more fun
universal has some awesome fucking rides
I liked the cruise ships
I got free icecream
thats on every cruise ship
free food is on every cruise ship
cause you alreadey paid a shitload of money
and a game center?
Fuck yea
i remember they had that on Royal caribean
fun times
i want to go on disney one though
luna
is sexy princess
agreed
same as celestia
and rarity, and twilight
fluttershy
braeburn, soarin, spitfire,
Luna is best princess
she is a kind mistress indeed
"cough cough"
the only good horse is yellow quiet
You mean nerdy purple
rarity is a teasing yet kind mistress
white selfish is a terrible and low tier horse
big mac is good too
Buytoast: Indeed *sips tea*
doesnt matter, she would be a kind and teasing mistress
awesome
Yellow Quiet is the worst horse.
Pink Crackhead is obviously superior.
who was yellow quiet?
pinkie pie is too hyperactive for my tastes >.>
pink obnoxious is mid tier at best
even the cider sliders are superior to her
So does Celestia just go on fucking vacation when ever a evil threat shows up and lets Twilight and her lackies deal with it?
she would probably break my spine and the bed
Cider Slider is a background horse.
from pure hyperactivity
SpadeKyurem: just like any good leader
Bronysith: Again people ask why I hate celestia
At least that's more of a horse than what pink obnoxious is.
SpadeKyurem: understandable, id still want her to #*$% me
Bronysith: ?)
what about spectrum speeder
*/)
SpadeKyurem: youd let her #*$% you?
/me shrugs
I'd majorly go for Luna though,
what about luna?
hell yea
luna is sexy princess like that
also considering shes been around for thousands of years, she probably picked up a few tricks
i come in to see this conversation. it must be a sign i should get back to studying
Hah
twilight_squirtle: about the same DX
study hard then
SpadeKyurem: of course she would have a few tricks up her...hoof slipper...things
who thinks apple bloom is the cutest filly?
Disregard School, Play WoW
Sweetie Belle
Your argument is invaid
*invalid
sorry
my hair is a pony
what kind of pony?
who's the first to air something on this site?
a black and red alicorn OC with a dark past
who I shipped with Twilight Sparkle
cool,jcelios
jcelios: kill yourself
and because he's also my hair I guess I'm shipping myself also 0_o
bronysith, don't be rude
At first I thought that red and black alicorn thing was a joke but now I'm not so sure.
Red and black alicorn OC with a dark past shipped with a canon character? kill yourself you uncreative bastard
Meanwhile: would it help if I ship you with him also
Not really, it'd clear it up more if you just said whether you were joking or not.
how can you ship hair?
http://i.imgur.com/jxTa7.jpg
butler: the fandom found a way
Scissors and Fedex?
and yeah I was joking XD
seriously, fuck this fandom most of the time ...
ok.....
Oh good. Otherwise I would have had to mock you until you left.
that is against regulations
Your face is against regulations.
wanna play rough?
That sounds a bit homo, so not really.
dont mind Meanwhile the only way he finds joy in life is by causing others misery
I just assumed the fact that I said he was made out of my own hair was crazy enough to make it obvious but yeah this fandom sometimes....
thanks
this is one of the worst fandoms ever
you cannot fucking deny it XD
it can be XD
and it is
you just got to find more of us out there
test
woot it works
Eh Sonic is worse
yeah whats up with that?
Punkie_Pue: what works?
why do so many crazy people gravitate towards sonix?
sonic
Nostalgia?
cause sonic is also a horrible fandom
Testing Thrash irc. it was giving problems earlier.
ah
I really hate my english class
Guess what I have to do
cause sonic fans are never fucking satisfied
SpadeKyurem: French?
Write a 900-1500 word essay on the Great Gatsby
jcelios:cool collectibles?
Worth 300 points of my grade
For information, the Semester Test is only 220 total
seriously, sonic fans are terrible usually
Am I terrible?
like bronies, there are few exceptions
bronysith, agreed
Im a sonic fan
SpadeKyurem: there are exceptions like you
You know who the worst sonic fans are?
Sonic Retro
Ok guys i must be off to class, see yall later tonight :)
sonic is cool but not that cool
SpadeKyurem: people liked that?
Bitching about Sky Sacntuary not being yellow enough da fuck
In all fairness most "sonic fans" probably don't even talk about sonic on the internet are regular people XD
and are*
Bye BladedWings :)
well
got to keep selection bias in mind at least if we're gonna speculate about whole populations
sonic fans make the worst OCs

Live and learn is the best sonic song SpadeKyurem
and the only one
yes its misreporting.
Bronysith: Hey I said its ONE I still think Live and Learn beats them all
live and learn is from what game exactly?
SA2
Sonic Adventure 2
oh!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrY5Jwk8gY4 Live and Learn!
SA2B is overrated...fun but it has some shit it couldnt get away with today
I Am All Of Me = Best song ^_^
/me drowns BladedWings
I have a tendancy to put on Sonic boss music when I fight bosses in WoW
there isnt much intensive music in WoW
thx
i dont play WoW

BladedWings: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbndyrUQkEc
SpadeKyurem: i think JRPGs have the best music usually
Mario and Lugi for example?
fuck those games
Bronysith: :'(
hai
But I like those...
i dont
XD
Final fantasy 6 and 7, persona 3, legend of Dragoon, chrono trigger
mem sos
those games are very close to tieing as my fav game of all time
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfbsD13Ri4U
and shadow of the colossus has the best soundtrack in all of gaming
thats for sure
i played a demo of that once
those pics aww
it was confusing
what an awesome game it is
butler: cause you werent using YOUR BRAIN
no i didnt no what to do
which game?
Shadow of the colossus
probably the best example as gaming being an artform
i like games which need some thinking

one thing i dont like about bronies
they feel the need to ponify EVERYTHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
I find it funny most of the famous people that shaped this country flunked out of school
Im pretty sure Einstine was one fo them
to join the army
except obama
hes the only one to not have any military or political experience
dafuq
And they say School is important
LIES
Well does making an atom bomb count?
Relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ZmM7zPLyI
the A-bomb does more damage than we know
it takes longer to clean
the aftermath that is
SpadeKyurem: i think school is mostly important for people who want to go into medicine, law, education
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3quTc2-GyM best video ever
well
Again, Einstien made a fucking atom bomb and never went to school
i kinda agree
for everything else
you just wasting time
and money
I dont think I need that much education to program or model videogames
SpadeKyurem: but not everyone has that kind of intelligence like einstein
agreed
but they brainwash you into believing that YOU NEED COLLEGE
most people are below average intelligence
more like YOU NEED TO GIVE US MONEY
butler: thank you jersey shore
I dont think college is needed
butler: but wouldnt below average if thats the majority be just average then?
they just use it as an excuse to dry you up
My brother is still fucking paying off his college bill
idk,bronysith
yes, yes you do
This is lies
seriously fuck college
only reason im in there is so i can get an education degree
Cool. Ignore my link.
so it is neccessary
ok. yes they would be and some of them are the smartest
sorry for delay
that is the only reason im at college, to get a degree in education to teach elementary kids
ok
cause seriously, kids are idiots
i hope you're good with them
take it away ren "IDIIIIOOOTS"
stupid motherfuckers
those are what kids are

SpadeKyurem, who said you're sleeping?
sorry to say, but an attitude like that will not teach kids that age correctly, BronySith
butler: that is why you fail
Hehe :$
Got to love the internet/

dont worry
no wonder they call you bronysith
i know how to teach kids
13teaching kids?

/me licks SpadeKyurem
I'm getting tired of these people who think they can use unions to get away with shit
awwww
In this economy, you take what you get
yup
SpadeKyurem: one of the reasons hostess went under
cause people
are
MORONNNNNS
FUCKING IDJIOTS
lol
Heres one example
A bunch of airlines closed
IDJIOTS
lol
IDJIOTS EVERYWHERE IT FUCKING BURNS
lol
The the piolits go on strike because tthere arent enough jobs
The fuck
Mr. Smith, calm down.
Uh.
Misinformed much?
shut up CriticKitten im sure Shizuka would agree
The reason Hostess went under isn't because lolunionsareevul
They kind aare
It's because Hostess wanted the workers to take ANOTHER pay cut.
My dad worked for a union
When shit goes down they dont protect you
No one streaming? D:
IDJIOTS
What you didn't hear from your favorite news station is that Hostess has been cutting their wages for years.
Plus people seem to think THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING being a union
Over and over and over again.
And they were finally fed up with making less money for doing more work.
Well
13less money?
13they were making $16 an hour
Now they have NO FUCKING MONEY
13for assembly line work
NO MONEY AT ALL CriticKitten so stfu
13that's on TOP of benefits
thousands are making no money at all
cause of IDJIOTS
13yes hostess was backed into a corner by what their upper management had done with the finances
If you're going to be impolite I'm not going to bother having this conversation.
13but the union picked a retarded time to push for a strike
Why are all the higher up people morons?
13because the government is set up to let them
why
Cause higher ups requires idiocy
are they busy
Shizu: I don't disagree in the slightest. My point was that this isn't the first time Hostess said "so we need you to go ahead and make less money plz"
Would it be considered blasphmey to act intelegent?
only idjiots can be politicians
SpadeKyurem: apparently
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBlw4C6rzDo
13CriticKitten: the problem is in this economy it's pretty dumb for the union to say NO WE WANT MORE when they're already making quite a lot more than similar unskilled work
Their management was a pack of wild idiots. Sure, the strike came at a terrible time, but blaming the union for this and no one else?
Also I still think that strike wallmart people did
Is just outrageously silly.
13everyone involved was stupid
hey, i was wandering already for a long time: whats needed for to stream?
offtopic...
and now everyone fucking suffers
13high management took a gamble on investments and blew it, and left lower management holding the bag
they are whining they have to work on black friday and the thanksgiving black friday
Shizu: I agree, everyone had a pretty firm hold on the idiot ball here. I just object to this nonsense that it was purely the union's fault. >_>
In this econemy people need jobs
13lower management absolutely had to make more money otherwise the company would fold
They threatened to walk if they didnt get off
They can be easily replaced
and hostess threatened to close down
Which is what they should have done.
FOREVER
/me shrugs
AND NOW THEY CLOSING
FOREVER
13liquidating
But Hostess's management, again, was too stupid to just say "okay, you're all fired".
13true that
13that may have been in part from the pressure from the other unions
And just hire people willing to take the jobs.
Maybe. Doesn't excuse them from some blame IMO.
CriticKitten: Which isnt that hard these days
13no but it's enlightenment
Which is why if anyone threatens to walk, I'll say BUH BYE
13if management said "okay, all you bakers union, bye we'll find people that want to work", there's a pretty good chance their other unions would have gotten mad
13unions these days are high on power
Which is why I said what I said. It's not just the unions being idiots. It's just that everyone wants to blame the unions because it's easier to blame one party in an argument rather than admitting that maybe both sides fucked this up
Not really
Ergo why we have people who still think that if we just vote all of one party into office, that things will magically get better
CriticKitten: Ie Obama because free shit
'cuz that's how compromise works.
13or that congress passing only a couple laws in a term is a BAD thing
13gridlock is what the system was designed for
One side getting all the power totally makes democracy work right?
Majority of the people who voted for him have GOVERNMENT BENIFITS
THAT WE PAY FOR
It isnt free you chucklefucks!
"HURR DURR, WE WANT MORE MONEY WITH LITTLE TO NO WORK"-every obama supporter ever
13well not just that
/me snorts
13there's also the OMFG THE REPUBLICANS ARE EVIL crowd
Actually, I voted for Obama in '08 because the alternative wasn't all that appealing to me.
13no mccain was a terrible candidate
I didn't vote for him this year, though.
I dont see the problem with Romney
Because I was fucking pissed that he extended the Patriot Act.
13palin got burned out by the media so early on they didn't have a chance
And his voucher of support for internet regulation didn't thrill me either
at least Romney didnt want SOPA
Wait, you guys didn't vote for Celesta/Luna? I'm disappointed...
Palin was part of the reason I didn't pick McCain actually, yeah.
aka fucking taxing the internet
The hell is taxing the internet gonna solve?
hola compadres
SpadeKyurem: more money for the government
taxing the internet?
I got tired of her really quickly. Part of it being media coverage and part of it being that some of what she said just made my head hurt.
13one of the major issues conservatives have, and quite a few of us know it, is too often we try to take the high road
You know what was the best thing about that debate?
Obama had no fucking idea what he was saying
13so when you have a media industry dedicated to tearing apart everything not-Democrat, we turn the other cheek because we think it's the right thing to do
He stammers and went uh alot
I'm not entirely convinced Romney did either. >_>
The town hall debate especially.
Hahaha Shizuka, you want to talk about that with my dad? He's the personnel officer at his job and he loathes unions despite being a lefter :D
They both avoided questions like the plague
what the hell, lottery results were posted, but not on the frontpage
13we figure people will join us because of character, and we're getting shown time and time again that the general public is much much more base than that
huh...

11,02Bronysith: They are on the homepage
Also them saying Romney is gonna give old people a voucher system is bullshit
Ello
"What sort of deductions are you considering for the tax code?" "Let me answer that by saying absolutely nothing about my plan that answers your question." said both candidates
11,02Hai Major :)
Obama's way is OH you're too old you dont need medical aid
SuperBrony64: there we go
HOW IS OBAMA BETTER
13CriticKitten: i get the sense the issue there was it's largely ryan's plan
SpadeKyurem: whats that? you worked hard your entire life and are successful? PUNISHMENT GAME
Likely, because Romney really dodged on specifics there and that hurt him a lot.
Hi.
13yep
Political stuff, eeeeeeeewwwwwww
hey
Nittany_Discord Hi
11,02Hey Nittany_Discord :)
hola bo0oring
/me snuggles Nittany_Discord
13between President Um and Candidate It's-My-VP's-Plan we still got shafted this election
Major: you are going into the military, therefore you are going to be a dog of the governemnt
13flaria changed nicks!
Deacon hello
Obama still hasent explained the ambassidor incident
I did.
/me glomps Nittany_Discord
Shafted might be too generous of a word.
13royally hosed
okay, i'm back. fking tech guy from school :I
/me hugs Shizuka, too
I want a god damned explination why those ambassidors were NOT FUCKING GUARDED
13flaria <3
ambassador incident?
not following the news lately, what happneed?
13on a completely different note why am i trying to build a large house in minecraft... i don't even know what i would do with a large house...
the diplomats I mean
13benghazi?
Shizuka: burn it down
build it so you can burn it
That one i think
I'd take it further, Shizu. We got Eva Rule 1'd.
Shizuka so you can house your big things of course
Obama still hasnt said a god damn thing about the lack of security
CriticKitten: always gets worse?
doesnt ring
Shizuka: unfortunately all right wing politicians here still are "HURR DURR IMMEGRUNT TEKENG UR JERB" or in it just for their personal gain :|
Which probably means the next election....ugh.
13yeah minecraft is large scale but... bleh i'm wasted on interior design...
11,02Shizuka: Put a smaller house inside the larger house.
so what DID happen?
Bronysith: ALWAYS.
Bronysith like Ill listen to the government :P
Think about it. You know it's the truth.
Major: hahahahah, like you have a choice being in the military
dumbass
13sec i'll upload a picture
Dark_Horst: Basically a bunch of people charged into the diplomat building
Killed the dipomats
All the elections anymore are just getting worse and worse.
oh hey, i think i might have heard someone once mention that
Major: going into the military, you become a symbol of the government, you do whatever they say for that is what the job of being a grunt or officer is
THERE IS NO FUCKING EXCUSE FOR THE LACK OF GUARDS OBAMA
SpadeKyurem: wait, what did i miss?
This election was a choice between a socialist and capitalist businessman. Seeing we're in a recession and many people hate business-types, it was the socialist FTW.
Major: if not you will be jailed or executed or some bullshit like that
13http://i2.minus.com/izNgEu8bI8QDN.png
Bronysith like you being hated by everypony
Bronysith: he'll be jailed
dead diplomats. usually, that's be followed by tanks
asshole
I still say Romney would have been a better option
Major: im just saying what awaits you in the military
11,02Shizuka: But...that's not a house D:
cause that is what being in the military is
At least Romney isnt going to make everyone buy healthcare
Romney would have been a better option if he had kept his mouth shut.
NOT EVERONE NEEDS IT
Shizuka: aaa, how lovely! :) (even if unfinished)
Bronysith Ill take my chances
13yeah.. it's a critical fantastical failure of message handling on the right's part, you need to build capital in order to crawl out of a recession, not tax the producers into the ground
Anyways, we got really derailed there. XD Anyways, yes, I'm in a union. No, I'm not evil. Yes, I do think for myself and willingly chose it. Why? Because I work in a low-income neighborhood full of entitled little shits who would sue me to hell and back if they could, and administration that actually performs illegal activities, so the added protection is actually sort of nice.
stupid choice
going to die for nothing
13unions work when they actually need to defend their workers
>Need to getmoney to get out of a rescession
So, yeah. Bash me if you want, but work in my environment and tell me I'm making the wrong call. >.>
11,02I think Derpy Hooves should be president.
> SPEND MORE MONEY
HOW DOES THAT FUCKING WORK OBAMA
13too often, and especially the big ones, they just swing around like a club demanding free stuff
HOW
SuperBrony64: nope.....it's a mad house.
Need to give people incomes.
Shizu: Like in New York.
13SuperBrony64: is just the framework for now
SuperBrony64: http://i.imgur.com/aPCg7.jpg

Also Obama is never fucking in the white house

He's always out

thelonepony: :Q
13just have to figure out how to design the exterior walls and what the interior layout will be
That's what we really need to fix.
Major: better than dieing for a stupid cause
11,02Build like a roof right now on top of what you have. It will look like there isn't really a house and then build underground :D
You know whats really stupid?
13but i want a big living room with a fireplace and huge windows to the ocean behind the camera
Obama says he needs money for obamacare
But it's probably crazy me making something small huge.
WELL STOP SPENDING TI ALL YOU DUMB SHIT
A DOG COULD BE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN YOU!
So Major wants to die on the army.......
SpadeKyurem: Winona?
/me flips a table in fury
And, for what it's worth, my mother is a Republican and also unionized for the same reason. So I'm not just crazy, it's actually kind of important in this profession any more. :p
11,02Shizuka: But...but...where will my video games go? O~O

it looked bice
*nice
but then i lost the save file
Cool
I wish I had mine craft :'(
13my problem atm is references... have maybe one person i could use... need two>>
SPADE
Shizu: Agreed. And I do think they've gone way too far. I just think it's silly to go full tilt the other way and call 'em all evil when they rose to power primarily because they were needed due to corporate abuses.
Except I have no money or friends to giftcode me and begging you guys would be pathetic
GET A CRACK
Nittany_Discord: Personality tests in JOB APPLIANCES? where is the world going to?!
I bought the game though
:3
Major: i aint doing shit for money, kids nowadays have no proper education and need to know that they dont have to go to college, that thats just an excuse for money to be sucked out from underneath them
I figure there's a nice big aisle in the middle and there's no need for extremism, black-and-whiting an issue that isn't black-and-white. :P
's what it boils down to.
I wish I had friends
I kinda don't want to work at a restaurant the rest of my life so I'm going to school after a year
/me takes SpadeKyurem to bed
Dark92Enigma: They've been around for decades. Mainly retail jobs where you have to interact with people, but I've seen them for Pizza Hut and even heard of them for IT jobs.
SpadeKyurem: lets make you some
For disabled people like me, it's a barrier too high for jobs.
I can't believe i'm going to agree with the villain, but like the Joker said once: ''When you're doing someting, you're not doing it for free'' but THIS IS RIDICULOUS
oni_link|birthday: today is your birthday :O
thelonepony: yep :3
SpadeKyurem: For starters, don't listen to Bronysith. He cray-cray. :P
I'm slow on tests, so I'll always fail those things.
Happy Birthdat oni_link|birthday :)
Bronysith well at least I know our vote for president is pointless and that we should vote for representatives and not the president himself
/me carries CriticKitten to bed

birthday*

Nittany_Discord that's a disability these days huh?
How good of a computer do you need to run Minecraft?

thanks Cynnivel
13SpadeKyurem: not much, it's just CPU and RAM intensive
It's why I've chosen to go with disability placement, but even they may not find me anything.
Major: Nowadays Congress is the big deal.
How intensive?
happy birthday oni_link|birthday!
13discrete graphics helps but in the end it's Java that'll hold you back
That doesn't mean the presidency is meaningless, but having a good mix in Congress is critical.
thank you Dark92Enigma
Deacon: I have ADD and anxiety disorder.
And it fix that by?
13uh CPU spikes when chunks need updating, which is primarily redstone for normal play, gets bigger when you have mods on
13RAM it needs a lot
Nittany_Discord oh
Deacon: what did you do to Aniki?
So a laptop aint gonna cut it
132-4GB to itself to start if you want the far rendering distance
It's kinda funny that facebook reminded me that today is my birthday today
13laptop can do it but it's laggy as hell
Depends on the laptop
13birthday!
My laptop runs Minecraft nice :3
Bronysith I just asked, though rude on my end though
Deacon: be mean to him again and you are going to get a serious talking to
13takara is pretty bad at minecraft, mostly because intel integrated graphics and only 4GB ram to throw around
And I don't have plans other than going to work XD
13or is it 2..
Happy birthday oni_link|birthday! :)
so I found out a large chunk of why SC4 keeps crashing, seems it does NOT like mulit-core cpu's so you have to assign it to a single core :/

She expects me to read The Great Gatsby and write a 900-1500 word essay in a week
CrystalPhoenix: Fiction or Non-Fiction?
SpadeKyurem: damn, she is crazy
jcelios doesn't get it
the essay 300 points, the final exam is only 220
That reminds me, I need to add another HDD to this compy. Which means I'll need a name schema for my HDDs....hrm.
Thats not how grading works
SpadeKyurem: don't worry, it gets better
Happy birthday, oni_link|birthday
CrystalPhoenix: oh :P

CrystalPhoenix: I'm a science student as is most of the people I know, so hearing stuff like that meant literally is fairly common for me XD
Goodbye, AdamTheDuck~
Ryunosuke: i think i'll be able to make VErdant Inferno :3

and hey maybe you can tell that joke too to one of your friend at school
ah, seeya AdamTheDuck
bye AdamTheDuck
It would probably start an argument about anti-gravity XD
theres probably a pun in there somewhere
yup
there we go
It really weighs you down with work
hello
lali-ho free
Hi Freefall29
Gotta love that gravity
so nothings happening right now?
seems like it
How is everypony?
i'm good Major ypu?
Major, fine. how are you?
Good
Good once again :P
things are swell
Cool.
bo0oring: you like ABR?
THEORY: Ponies are actually hundreds of feet larger than humans and the "My Little Pony" from the title is spoken from Celestia's POV. Discuss.
ABR? Dunno. I like heavy music.
StinkomanFan: Dafuq? that is all.
StinkomanFan interesting
bo0oring: august burns red
Are the mods getting drunk or something?
bo0oring: you just linked them
Bronysith, ye, got you. right now found them on youtube
Bronysith, sounds good. Never heard of them tho.
bo0oring: they are my friends fav band...right behind metallica
StinkomanFan: It's always been my headcanon that the "My Little Pony" title and theme song are an ancient equestian childrens song
Somehow they remind me of old Sliknot and Korn.
Thing i going to love 'em.
:) Wow! That's some front page news - that just made my day
jcelios, that's a really nice way to look at things.
yep
YAY! Drawing Training Grounds are back!
damn, this AppleDash thing sure drawn good. Pity it just a clop
Pity Flutterdash is the OTP.
what is OTP?
oh w8
One True Pairing, I think
ja, it is
Onion Thinks Ponies
:D
i always wonder-how do i make myself to EQD Draw friend? Does they chose what to post?
I think they have people who go through new art and select them
iirc, you send them something via email, and they queue your art
maybe that too
Good art, knowing the people who do it, popularity, etc
they won't post anything though, so gotta filter through them
whats the twilight please picture from
i believe from an old comic
?
cant remember from who :I
Hello people
bo0oring: I honestly have no idea bo0oring, doesn't look bad to me

thelonepony because a Braviary is the best representation of Freedom!
I'm not too sure if I have
Uncle Sam won the war for freedom with the help of a bald eagle carrying him overseas to slay the british demons of terrorism and communism of course.
okay, just saying
I've read some of it
sorry
do YOU?
no :I
Y U NO STREAM DURING SCHOOL?!
Do you even patriotism
GoldenMic: becuase they have lives?
i'm mexican :I
thelonepony, iktfb
GoldenMic, why stream during school
while in school you should be focused
^
oh that was meant for Buytoast
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Raise the Sun / Equestria at Night / Nightmare in Ponyville
oh speaking of school
pfft who needs fo- SQUIRREL!
Don't you question my patriotism.
because, this class teaches NOTHING
Why?
My Uncle Sam statue is in pristine condition boy.
Well, I find myself to write myself into the story if not as a dragon myself.
Screw patriotism
I bet your has scuff marks and shit all over it.
Blasphemy.
GoldenMic well what is it trying to teach?
Buytoast mine is wearing my old ACUs
I refuse to be patriotic to a country who elects morons and can't get it's shit together
what SpadeKyurem said
Hello?
I'm not sure what you mean by that
jcelios: ha
/me deactives google fu
thats a first
bored...
who is the OC pony DJinh?
I mean like a transformation into a dragon or a dragon from far off in the spyro universe. It really is cool when I have an idea to do in my spare time.
the bronystate one I assume
DJing
oh that's VioletVanilla
what about the guy with the Illustrator cutie mark?
You want to write a story?
tan one?

I have one on paper and on Word, but if you want, we can here just tell me if I go a bit out with it.
SpadeKyurem, Oh gawd that video
Squirrelking is best author
Also forgive me if I sound or act like a villian, okay
/me finds Wepon
I have to kill fast but bullets too slow
I love bad fanfic readings XD
which?
jcelios, any bad fanfic reading
oh the Half life one
one day, one mod should totally do some dramatic reading of bad fanfiction
^^^
the pants were ded
any series
Hellfirecoms does that
But where would be find any bad pony fanfiction :o
not possible
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbUL6DZOtk Heres another good one
Was it just me or did that person make no sense?
jcelios, oh there are many horrible fanfiction of MLP
jcelios fimfiction?
where would they find any GOOD pony fan fiction
Buytoast fimfiction?
just go in fimfiction and search for the largest dislike bar
Did they want to roleplay or something?
CrystalPhoenix: I dont think thats how it works
next time I'm going to use /s
...darnit, I miss Vivi. ;-;
or get a crossover in here http://www.fanfiction.net/
50 shades of grey is worst fanfic
English might be a 2nd language for him
pretty much
it is a fanfic of a fanfic after all
jcelios: there's one with a HUMAN joining Twi in the Canterlot Wedding. she (the human) has no relevance in the story whatsoever, and she's basically there just to talk and add quotes
Who's the OC with the trident thing and all the books? *dumb*
MadSurge: thats valthejean
hold on.......
MadSurge: Val I think
AKA caramel
Damn it
lol, hi :P
SpadeKyurem: gimme money
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbUL6DZOtk This is a hilarious animation a fanfic
I listened to a dramatic reading of some fanfic where twilight goes back to magic kindergarden and wears a diaper and constantly shits herself. It was riveting.
http://i.imgur.com/NM7yn.jpg
*of a
I picked up another vintage Atari computer today
and yeah, that's true
MadSurge: Caramel. The one with the glowing eyes is VAL
MadSurge: his alter ego
lol
I remember that show
Dark92Enigma wait wha?
I got the disturbing feeling it was meant to be erotic...
http://www.comichammer.com/forum/download/file.php?id=2&sid=feab2ec4c5799c466a438b04d9fa7de2
Ah thanks guys ^^ I can identify the others fine, but not that one :D
jcelios: 50 shades of grey?
50 Shades of Brown
50 shades of grey is not a proper example of BDSM
http://www.fanfiction.net/crossovers/My-Little-Pony/621/ choose your poison
Bronysith: but a perfect example of sadomasochism
MadSurge: no it is not
Deacon: i'll explain: it's just like Jekyll and Hyde. Caramel is Jekyll (the nice guy) VAL is Hyde (the monster)
hi amu-chan
Bronysith: yes it is, if you decide to read ir
You have to remember someone somewhere is getting off to it
*it
http://i.imgur.com/qa9mx.png
MadSurge: i have a few friends in BDSM, one whos been on the scene for 18 years, he says it is not a proper representation of anything to do with BDSM
"friends
"
Deacon: when he comes in as Caramel, he's nice and playful, when VAL comes in, he trolls us---just because
I always figured the blue OC is Phase4.
hah
Dark92Enigma well, odd
Bronysith: I know, but I meant that it's so painful to read you might as well get a cat o' nin e tails and hit yourself
whos the oc in bandages then
MadSurge: thats just masochism then, not sado masochism
Ghosties I think
alexxm: Ghosties
the blue OC with the videogame ghosts is SuperBrony64
thanks oni_link and MadSurge
my bad, Ghosties
oh and happy birthday oni_link
^
thanks alexxm
Deacon: my bad, i just realized that the OC in bandages is Ghosties.......:$ sorry :(
:D dat PLEEEEEEEASE image
Deacon: BUT MY THEORY still stands
Man its boring around here
oh, it was a theory
BDSM is so awesome
Also dat BaconMane
http://youtu.be/SwpUvVNu4Wo
Common Mantra of BDSM community is "Safe Sane Consensual" If it's not that its probably just a fictional fantasy or some fringe.
Deacon: it still counts. just ask Caramel (when he shows up next summer)
you'll notice
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIg3rygMAuk Ahem...Gentlemen?
jcelios: who WROTE THAT?
SpadeKyurem: hahaha
Dark92Enigma: wrote what?
*snort* magic
LOL :D
jcelios: that fic of Twi going to kindergarten
oh
lemme see if I can find it
i think dr eggman is one of the worst doctors ever
lemme see if i can find that other s****y fic
Bronysith: I guess he was set to be.
Bronysith I'll say, what is he doctor of anyway?
Deacon: Science
Seriously this is great. http://youtu.be/SwpUvVNu4Wo
Robotnik builds impressive shit, shame none of it actually works
isnt it awesome how dr wily built Zero?
and became friends with X?
Zero did of course XD
and he was designed to destroy megaman
and isnt it ironic Zero made Light's dream a reality?
SpadeKyurem: i love megaman X4
what was that dream?
For Humans and reploids to live in peace
He acomplished that esentally at the end of Z4
Dark92Enigma: found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTS4gQPZPyA
dat thumbnail :O
so Dark92Enigma do you think it's a good idea that the intercontental and united states championship scenes are intwined at the moment

meh
08,01Bronysith: aye
Ponies are good, but I'm not sure I'd count them in the top 10 best ever shows. Not even sure about top 10 cartoons.
Quantity=/=quality
Speaking entirely objectively on the matter.
Its the longest running FOR A REASON
08,01it does give scifi a bad name, in my opinion
Haku1013: then by that logic, simpsons is best animated show ever
holy fuck
does current simpsons suck
Batman!
Bronysith: so true ...
Ill be the last person to say Quantiy is the same as quality
But DW is the longest running for a reason
My favourite Simpsons episode is from season 2... Just sayin'...
season 2? really?
I think it's season 2, yeah.
Simpsons is like Family Guy; its a long running show because its stupid funny
no
uhm
simpsons was really REALLY REALLY FUCKING GOOD
not saying its humor is the same
Family Guy is stupid
now it is just stupid like family guy
before simpsons had its own creative humor
Yeah, season 2.
Its humor is stupid funny. Thats why its popular and still watched, because its a great series.
now it is like family guy by using already established jokes from youtube or internet or some stupid shit like that
Episode 1, season 2, even. "Bart gets an F". Absolutely brilliant episode.
current simpsons sucks
xles: oh yea
I agree with Bronysith and xles
Simpsons WAS the greatest animated series, but todays doesnt compare to the older episodes
todays simpsons episodes purely suck
old cartoons generally seem to be better than newer ones.
suck so goddamn much
I know his pain, so well there. Do your very best, and yet you're not good enough to pass. Your best - isn't good enough. Heartbreaking episode.
and its the new simpsoms that drag it
down
I usually don't like humanized ponies but I really like humanized Lyra for some reason
Question, what vector program do you guys recommend.
gamax92 Thats simply because the shows that we grew up with stick with us more than the new ones. A lot fo the old shows, although good, werent great.
but the simpsons just needs to end
End it with another movie
I'm thinking between inkscape and paint too sai
gamax92: Counter question, what is the intended use of it?
Currently, retracing over pencil. Later when i get a tablet, drawing things.
For illustration I use Inkscape.
kthx
the original simpsons was amazing, current simpsons is just being family guy
^
Bronysith: Exactly.
Was brilliant, turned into shit grind.
DSFSDf dslfjskfj skdfjkafnkadfndsf he didn't upload mine
hey everypony :)
wat
hi AJIsAwesome!
but the question is
why is south park still good?
Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony and Dark92Enigma-. :)
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Bronysith: Writing staff.
so inkscape you guys say?
hi AJIsAwesome :)
cause they do all the things that i was just complaining about with current simpsons
Hi, thelonepony. :)
but its good CAUSE THE WRITING IS GOOD
well I like to use Inkscape for diagrams a lot :_
:)
Bronysith: the writing, nuff' said
nothing like SVG diagrams!
gamax92: It's a bit quirky at times, but for illustration it's nice. Don't know about straight up drawing in it though.
i cant wait for the new south park RPG
South Park is family guy humor on steroids
Well I'll keep pts on hand, but I'll try out inkscape.
most of the time I see people drawing in photoshop with tablets
Haku1013: except done right
my god ... 75KB's
whats wrong with my internet
/me slaps gamax92
Because Humor on steroids is always funny. Ex: Animainacs
hell yea
animaniacs is just
pure
fun
Animatiacs were awesome.
amen
you cant watch that show without smiling
no i dare you
watch a full episode of animaniacs, and dont smile
I can, but I'm also an emotional robot.
Bronysith: can i just pay you 20$ instead
sure you wont be on your ass laughing, but you will have a smile
gamax92: sure
Bronysith: impossibru
what if I have a muscle condition in my FAAAACE!?
gamax92: need my paypal?
no I'll just put some money in winrar and send the file to you.
no
Wouldn't*
It can never come back
I can't type. =(
most of the writers went their own ways
"ITS TOO FUNNY, IM DIEING OF LAUGHTE * ugh"
jcelios: Been snorting graphite all day. That must be why I can't type.
animaniacs is just pure fun, but then
theres Batman TAS
that show is just
epic
graphite? pure lead straight to the eye ball
if they DO make a comeback, the intro has to start off telling us all that we've waited long enough for the 101 episode
Bronysith: If it were to come back it would be the same disaster as the Futurama comeback. =/
jcelios: thats not funny
xles: of course
my mom got lead in her eye
My brain is full of fuck right now. i can barely think straight
current futurama, family guy, and simpsons
I like JLU better than Batman TAS
suck
gamax92: how'd that happen?
Amen.
Bronystih Futurama doesnt have the same humor as Family Guy. Granted theyre on the borders, but they still mange to have a slightly different humor that makes them different
NOOOO inkscape slowed down to 54KB's
Bronysith: Why does my internet hate me
/me sets tonberries loose into gamax92 s computer
cause lead in yo eye
no idea
everyday
all day
gamax92 fuck you thats why
xles: gross
wat
hmmm
Bronysith: haha
that isnt terrible, not half bad actually
samurais suck
"You suck!"
Samurai Jack
Gum Do sword mastery for life
PUIRE AWESOME
wow xles ...
thats kinda good
*pure
Usagi Yojimbo (though technically a Ronin)
Gum do was incredibly fucking fun
Samurai Jack was just amazing.
^
^^
cant believe i got banned from the school though >.>
Bobobo-bobobobo was also funny
Bronysith: downloading porn again? :)
Ryunosuke: Half decent for a programmer eh? ;)
I got suspended from school for accidently overloading the network.
Haku1013: Oh, I LOVED that show.
Ryunosuke: no i got banned from my Gum Do dojo
its not bad, but it's no wrek :0
:)
I got like 12 people to go load up a round of Ace of Spades
Hehe
nyeh
Bronysith: ah
i was thrown out, for a good reason though
Well, I know I can't draw worth a bit. But that wont stop me from pretending I can.
So now when I host the server I have to put a cap on the bandwith the server uses.
to be fair
okay a few questions Bronysith, what kind of school was it?
Ryunosuke: martial arts school
Too much hadouken?
...or not enough?
lets just say my sparring partners were waaaay too weak
...You went Cobra Kai on their ass, didn't you...
oh
not only breaking her sword, but landing a blow on her face
I was thinking more of .... Gohei from kenshin
Did you yell "NO MERCY!", and sweep her leg?
nope
my form was too berserkish
http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120306140447/kenshin/images/9/9e/Gohei.jpg -- this guy? :)
fuck that
i meant in the fashion that he got kicked out of the Kamiya School :p
BY FLUTTERSHY'S BEARD
:p
Fake beard, but still.

haha, no...
Ryunosuke: trust me, ive improved since then
kthxbai
much more control
:D
that....
thats pretty good
/me may be starting to learn how to use them pencils.
though on my own, cause i dont want to hurt anyone XD
Ryunosuke: If you're brave enough you can click back through the past 11 days and check my progress from December 1st. I must warn you, it get worse pretty fast. =P
/me bursts through the roof of the chat room
HUZZAH!
oh dear
Rarity in the shower
at least... I "THINK" that's Rarity
/me gets hit by a piece of ceiling and is knocked out
Ryunosuke: Giggity
It is.
oh hai mark
=o
I did not hit her I did NAWT!
SpadeKyurem: yeah you did >:I
/me smacks SpadeKyurem with the chancla >:I
and ya, you have gotten better
are you okay Fluffy D:
Ryunosuke: Nice to hear that it isn't just my imagination. =)
well thats it for me tonight
night
Night Haku1013 :)
the off stream buffer thing needs more random images
Ok I have a question, that englishman saying a meme in old english is a meme right? What is it called?
Never did learn to draw as a kid. Figured it was childish and complete hokum. "Who needs art anyway, bah humbug" and so forth. In later years however... What is life without art? And what better way to preserve artforms than learn to practise them? *ohdear*
Some times I question art
most of it looks like a mess
mods are asleep arent they?
I bet all the mods are partying on Mod Island
most likely
It's an operator party, and none of us are invited.
well, that means we have to make a Party on our own then
ello everypony :$

A party?
That sounds tedious.

Ohai Derpy_Hooves :)
Concord looks a litte south on that map lol
i suggest setting everything on fire
god i want to be a cartoon character
real life animation looks so bad
So bored...
What type of cartoon character would you be?
Punkie_Pue: no idea
Punkie_Pue: something from animaniacs or ren and stimpy
Cartoon tree?
actually no
if i wanted to live ren and stimpy
id swallow 5 sheets of acid
:)
but living as an animaniacs character would be pure fucking fun, right otakon ?
nah
too crazy at times
so fucking fun
honestly would rather be a G4 pony
well yea
but in between that and animaniacs
Im not sure if id want to be a pony lol. perhapps living there as another creature would be fun
god i dont know what i want
well being a pony in equestria guarantees molestation from molestia
lol
so otakon you will have fun times
dammit
I don't wanna be molest :P
Not having thumbs or any digits for that matter would be limiting.
otakon: even if it felt really really really really really really
/me throws R63 dust on herself

Much better~

RaveBrony: noting much
Oh myyyyyyyy

Bronysith: My OC's name
Bronysith: http://i.imgur.com/3qwv8.gif
thelonepony: thank you
He's a navy color and his cutie mark is a 47 after all~
why 47?
Because of the Ponies47 nickname
He cant think of cutie mark based on his Personality/what he's good at
but 47
what does 47 have to do with anything?
I'm not good at anything. It started out as joke with the 47 cutie mark but has just stayed that way ever since.
Navy_Numbers: I ship you with my OC http://i.imgur.com/lzxUp.png
jcelios: kill yourself
Dat OC o_o
*o_e
jcelios: FUCK NO. I'm taken anyways
Plus Navy Numbers is a stallion
he's got a and mysterious dark past
Navy_Numbers: flutters?
and likes experimenting
but he's a Mary sue OC
fanfic inprogress
jcelios: your oc is horrible and you should feel horrible
die
he's also in a relationship with all of the mane 6
thelonepony: Nope
but he's man enough to share
jcelios: GO DIE
That is just a terrible OC
jcelios: even as a joke
die
just die
im sensing some hostility here
/me would hate to say it but agrees with Bronysith :S
/me kicks jcelios out
maybe some more shipping with my OC with calm everyone down
no
just no
/me stabls jcelios with her horn "Don't even"
stabs*
jcelios: You ship your OC with mine I SWEAR TO GOD -_-
pls dont anger us
you dont like it when we're angry
Don't get me angry. You'll be sorry~
what if I told you my OC could beat sephiroth in battle?
im guessing Navy_Numbers is ponies47?
thats really hot right?
yeah
not
jcelios: hahahahahahhahahahahahahahha
no*
SEPHIROTH
IS A PUSSY
compared to kefka
and Nyx
and lavos
i liek sefyroth, eh stabs people and isn't afraid of anything
he could beat sephiroth and goku at the same time
goku is a pussy
jcelios: Never. Your not getting your stupid OC's hoofs on mine
goku is best hero
he's also a shapeshifter and likes to spend time as an animated hedgehog like thing
jcelios: even if you are still joking or trolling, just die

thelonepony: dat dr.evil :D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x88Z5txBc7w&feature=endscreen&NR=1
Code lyoko is overrated
also his name is Dark Phoenixsama
I never got into Code Lyoko
jcelios: Your OC is bad and you should feel bad
I suddenly feel that http://www.dorkly.com/video/43504/sonic-meets-an-oc is now relevant
the kids these days, bad = good right?
Sephiroth, though a decent villain, is incredibly overrated
not as good as kefka
What are you? 10 years old or something jcelios?
cause kefka is best villain of final fantasy, if not ever
13hm
jcelios: yea seriously, how old are you?
13well... i *was* hopeful for the live action aelita
Navy_Numbers: my mom told me not to give out my age over the internet!
I'm "18"
/me hides in Megas in vault 8324
and hello everypony!
hi spypengen
Hi spypengen
jcelios: Ok then your totally not anywhere near 14 then if you listen to your parents.
yeah, I mean I'm 18
no you're "18"
jcelios: dat fat lie
that means not 18
but you're just saying 18
jcelios: could you repost your oc please? i just got here and what to see whats wrecking everyone's jimmies
look, time is relative anyway
13the CG is better but they should have kept the same VAs
TA DA: http://i.imgur.com/lzxUp.png
ah ok lel
Caramel: :D all dem ocs
Oh hey Shizuka
almost as good as my glorious oc
/me licks Caramel
13*sigh*
13guess season 4 will still be the last season of lyoko
Shizuka: wat? code lyoko?
careful bronysith, you might get super pregnant
twilight_squirtle: that "good" oc that blachi made for you?
Dat Caramel
Caramel: of course i want your baby
Code Lyoko is still going on?
I thought that show ended years ago
13fifth season is coming
Tailz is best OC
/me looks at the movie trailer
....
thelonepony: thats the second form of my oc, first is that paint one
13live action, retcons XANA back into existence after he was utterly destroyed in the series finale
Why is there ANY live action in that?!?
Oh, I didn't know Lyoko is still going on.
...
It looks like SHIT.
....................
lemme show you guys my OC
/me grabs an evoker
The CG is fantastic, mind, but the live action bits....
live action Code Lyoko?
/me places against temple
oh dear
Are just....
/me shoots himself in the head, summoning his persona that is a tonberry
ARGH. They look like a high school film project!
KILL THE WRITERS
13they SOUND like a high school film project..
13nothing will compare to sharon mann
And the....lip sync....?
13well it's a french show
here's my OC http://i.imgur.com/9le0W.png
WAIT! A live action Code Lyoko? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
13animation lets you get away with it, live action not so much
code lyoko is french?
and it's best OC
i know, but it's so....
Bad
spypengen: kill yourself
It took me a second viewing to really appreciate how bad. ._.
code lyoko has some fun ideas
I thought you had an OC as well Bronysith. Or are you a OC hater?
its just not as good as i remember it
well I tried :'(
Code Lyoko is fine just as it is! it doesn't need a ''Winx Club'' revival, or something like that!
Man. If not for the CG bits, I'd be lining that film up to take its rightful place as the right hand of The Last Airbender in the Hall of Fucking Shame
Navy_Numbers: not an oc, just a character a friend drew for me
Navy_Numbers: i am not having an official OC, ever
Because the live action stuff is just so awful. It kills the movie for me and I haven't even seen it yet. ._.
What a shame. >.<
Bronysith: Oh yeah that's right. Wasn't it based off of that fanfic you wrote or something?
13lyoko is like modern tron
Navy_Numbers: god, that fanfic.
13only better graphics and variety
fucking sucks dry ass
13it'll probably do better in france where people are used to the face build
dry ass... wat
Shizuka: and story-wise, how is it?
13some of us liked the giant foreheads
why nothing on teh stream :(
Shizuka: you mean heads that dont match the bodies?
BIG FUCKIGN HEADS
13at some point i might start season 3 and 4 for stream
of what?
13sumi did a bit of season 1 but that's their weakest
Yeah, but it's just such a damn shame.
man i used to be addicted to obsesed with Code Lyoko
13i never kept season 2 either cause it was just "capture and possess aelita, friends arrive just barely in time"
With CG like that, you just know it could've been so much better
i don't even know why
Bronysith: I remember you suggested I read it. I did. To be honest it wasn't that bad.
Shizuka: i remember you told us so....
13but 3 and 4 are fantastic
Navy_Numbers: looking back on it, now that i got some official writing tips...yea...it sucks
dry mucky warthog ass
133 does awesome plot development with slowly removing sectors of lyoko, and 4 has the internet which is actually underwater
you know, i never saw the series finale of code lyoko
Plus, on a minor note....is it REALLY a good idea to use the same naming schema for your movie as Dragonball Z did for their live action movie?
fuck that shit
Bronysith: I can't write stories for squat! XD
so lemme get this straight.....there's a live action CODE LYOKO MOVIE?........WHY!?
Don't even get me started on what I tried to write once -_-
Navy_Numbers: at least you didnt start

Bronysith: I did start it but then tossed it out before I even finshed the first paragraph.

Soulless_DCLXVI: he has a thing against brightly colored OC's
ah yes, red and black
spypengen: okay honstly, not that bad
the most original of color schemes
Oh, wait. I gotta see this OC. brb
spypengen: but a very common color scheme
well I like red and my hair is black and the green matches the cute mark
Could be worse.
so that's my reasoning for the color scheme
...

otakon: have you played half life?
*:)
reebs: No non image links please.
too many OC's are pegasi and unicorns
Rarely do I see an earth pony OC. Props.
reebs: No vid links during stream . :)
Canadian_Brony: Nice OC. Here's my OC, Navy Numbers http://i.imgur.com/T5CV6.png :)
Canadian_Brony: cool :3
oh jeez, sorry. Wrong net/channel!
reebs: no video links please while stream it going
otakon: so have you played half life?
jcelios she's an earth pony. She don't need dat fancy crap
...
I'm sorry I'm sorry! ;A;
Bronysith: yeah
inb4 half life is overratted
=_________________-=
otakon: what do you think of it?
reebs: it's okay, just be more careful
Bronysith: it was okay
Canadian_Brony: yeah major props for that alone lol :)
Good looking OCs all around :) haha
honestly didn't get all the hype
but it was good
otakon: the best mod that isnt a mod
otakon: yea, i can see the appeal
wow, that celestia radio IRC allows NSFW images...its weird
Ponies47 lookin' snazzy
[]DeadpoolDash: O_O
otakon: but honestly, it along with doom kind of get way too much hype
well THAT possibly can't end badly
Bronysith: have you tried out the Doom BFG edition?
Canadian_Brony: Took me forever to come up with his design =_=
amg planetside
otakon: i just dont care for doom for some reason, it was fun, but people need to calm the fuck down
Ponies47: What does your cutie mark mean?
hello everypony
Hi AVS619
i get that it introduced FPS pretty much
Hello AVS619 :)
Sup, AVS619?
Ponies47 you don't know that feel until you make him/her into a sprite for Desktop Ponies. I spent 10+ hours on it.
looks like wrek needs help :p
hi AVS619
and i appreciate that, still a fucking good game, but otakon , people need to calm down with it
Soulless_DCLXVI: I have no tallent IRL so the 47 cutie mark was just a thing because of my nickname
Bronysith: If you grew up liking something it later becomes THE BEST THING EVER NO MATTER WHAT.
Ah.
Ryunosuke: Nah, he's Rambo'in it ;)
Canadian_Brony: O-O
jcelios: so thats where overration and hype comes from?
Ponies47: I'm sure you'll find your talent. :)
with a sundy
stupid Imgur being slow . . . anyays, this is her without coveralls http://imgur.com/wZUgs
My special talent is being a fluffy pony
Ponies47: but the 47 is cute in your rump
/me carries AttackWithHugs to bed
bloody pony maker ponies
She's cute.
AttackWithHugs: which is awesome :3
Ohai Sithy~
thelonepony: :$
pony maker ponies, yay!
Critchley: afterall, pony creator discourages creativity
its good for people who want quick oc's
/me prances around with a decently high fever ^_^
Bronysith: Rosy Retrospection is the term in psychology, it's a big part of that effect.
I never could make my own... Couldnt find a decent maltese cross for my cutie mark :(
If I had ANY talent in drawing, I wouldn't use a pony creator. But alas, I have none.
Critchley: or who cant draw or have friends who can draw for them
To me, it gives a good starting base for those who want to draw their OCs. Gives them a clearer picture.
Plus, would make it easier for other artists to draw it.
.....I made my OC using pony creato and use it as a reference for the colors when i finally draw it....
does that make me a bad person?
no
i guess, but wouldnt it be better for sketches?
Nope.
no it does not
no it doesnt lol
LadyCanary *cough* sprite animation *cough
i just dont like pony creator oc's xD
YES IT DOES YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON :V
I'd love a lil sprite one day ^_^
emantrollslayer: D:
me too
LadyCanary: im sure Vordox would do it XD
hmmmmmm....
but I haz no skills

What Bronysith ?
Why does it seem like most everypony on tonight is in a real sh** mood?
but i suck at sprites ;3;
LadyCanary what about a little perler of your OC?
My OC started in Pony Creator and went through multiple versions but the version I have at the moment I'm happy with ^_^
otakon: you are pretty kick ass at mass effect 3 multiplayer, that shit gets hard on gold
A what?
Soulless_DCLXVI: I'm not.
LadyCanary the little beads that you can iron together
OH.
:)
:P
Nah. Not that.
they're really cool though ;__;
/me made a schweet fluttershy
otakon: i mean you usually play on gold or diamond right?
Bronysith: platinim and no
I suck at Gold and Plat
:O
ahh
Oh gosh.
Canadian_Brony: how nice of you
:)
Bronysith well he IS canadian
T-thank you!
they're all nice
false
also that is really fuckign stereotypical
STEREOTYPES
emantrollslayer *sigh* come see my high school.
"nice" does not exist there
Canadian_Brony hey man, feel free to throw stereotypes back at me. I love stereotype jokes
and that's because high school
"I fell off my igloo and I broke my knee. Dont worry, here in canada it's free."
otakon: whats with all the characters in chrono trigger having scarves?
let's go to the hospital*
lel http://bakingbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/nomskulls.jpg
We even have stereotypes for ourselves! We're that pessimistic
Canadian. Brony. Nerd. Teenager. Bisexual. My list goes on.
Canadian_Brony you mean your list of awesomeness?
though stereotypes and racism is developed from experience
Canadian_Brony excpet for the teenager part
and for sometimes good reason
emantrollslayer those are my stereotypes. Awesomeness is much, /MUCH/ longer.
Bronysith, not always.
:p
otakon: whats with all the characters in chrono trigger having scarves?
man, I really need to make more perlers soon. I have a dr whooves half done but I dont have enough brown beads ><
Kandarihu: i mean, if a kid say is bullied by mexicans or asians throughout his/her whole life, they might assume that all asians or mexicans are bad
Bronysith: Thats if their parents didnt put that in their heads first :/
LT_SKINNY: developed
that is still developed
experiences, etc
Yeah. But Im just saying that most racism starts in the home
LT_SKINNY racism=/= stereotype
I hate that more than anything
LT_SKINNY: doesnt have to be, people arent exactly unbiased. some bad personal experience can suffice
racism= false assumption that one race is better than another
you can be stereotypical without being racist
Bronysith racism= discrimination or lack there of due to someone's race
stereotype=all black people eat fried chicken
emantrollslayer: nope
yes
Bronysith: It's not false. Charr > other races....oh wait, you mean in real life
Bronysith Racism: Prejudice or discrimination directed against someone of a different race based on such a belief.
Well I heard Bronysith talking about Asians and Mexicans so I assumed we were on racism :P
wast
my bad
*wat
....nope, gonna stick with my original answer even then. Charr are still best race.
Canadian_Brony oh, I thought you said weast
dooode
CriticKitten
wazzup
I don't know what I said
Not much.
oh hey it is Wrek kicking ass as a mini mech
bah I keep getting stream stutter
Who/what are the Charr?
Oh shoot, just saw Deadmau5 on that commercial advertising those Sonos speakers
Kitty people.

05and stay that way
I heard it somewhere before
/me hides behing Wrek
Thank you LadyCanary : 3.
rofl i love how the shortest song in the eva 3.0 ost is "peaceful timess", only 50 secs
Ah yes... peaceful times -w-...
and the happiest : 3
twilight_squirtle: did you already see rebuild 3.0?
>peaceful times
>Eva movie
CriticKitten: gainax humor
HAHAHAAHAHA
CriticKitten: hence why its the shortest song
Movie is clearly trolling its viewers
the ost for 3.0 is out I believe
Bronysith: no ive not unfortunately
Like most anime movies haha
there iws only a partial camrip
twilight_squirtle: damn, i need torrents or some shit for that film, it is going to be good
what film
I cant remember a dragonball movie where I was actually invested
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rHIluanfL._SY300_.jpg
Evangelion Rebuild 3.0 Buytoast
Nice shootin Wreky ^_^
I need to actually vote on the next brony movie night. I want to watch BLACK DYNAMITE again
<3
that thing with that wimpy kid and the asshole dad?
Yes Buytoast
Buytoast: and giant alien monster mechs
Bronysith: well judging by most of the ost, rule number 1 will stil be in effect, most of the music is giving off a "we're all about to die" vibe, altho one seems more or less upbeat, like a final stand
We can vote on the movie night? Where?
twilight_squirtle: of course theres rule 1, it IS evangelion of course
Um. allright then.
13canary canary <3
i remember SUmica showing two of those things or something

it was one of these weekened for the season 3 movie night/ episode stretch
Anyone?
Okay fine. :P
Twas I Vordox
Buytoast: apparently very influential in anime story telling
but of course the chat becomes terrible between the movie night and the episode
Twas so? Whyzo?
Oh, Canadian Brony will make your sprite? =3
Oh, so I showed that Code Lyoko trailer to my friends. They were all crying. Safe to say I made their days tangibly worse. I hereby declare today a succeesful day.
Wreky camping like a baus
Actually evangelion inspired alot of animes : o
Yes yes apparently Vordox ^_^
Roxsnow: thats what i said
Awesome LadyCanary ^^

Uh, I can't do it.
Cant do what?
damn, mashed potatoes and corn is some good shit
you can't figure out the mewsletter doohickey?
Buytoast: why is that? i still dont get it
Yeah.
Hmm... it should work :/
you don't get mashed potatoes and corn?
they were made for each other man
Maybe it doesnt like you Soulless? :D
Soulless_DCLXVI: I think it's because the lottery isn't open at the moment.
like peas and carrots
Buytoast: no i do, i dont understand why it tastes for fucking awesome lol
it does
it really does
Turkey and mashed potatoes all day erday.
turkey is alright
oh yeah, it's been so long I have done a lottery < : o....
but you cant combine them
Funny...
I KNOW THIS GAME HATE ME
and put em i9n a bowl
I find this song very...
romantic
well, i suppose you can, but it's be awkward to eat
Shouldn't I be able to sybscribe to a weekly newsletter at any time, where or not the new one is out yet?
i like Roast beef and mashed potatoes, smothered in gravy of course

Hey FlutterMEDIC
LT_SKINNY: Lucky. :<
/me calls out for a FlutterMEDIC
mtv should be renamed to rtv
FlutterMEDIC!
the only thing i'm wondering is what the heck is this song?
Need a dispenser here!
this would be a better game if it lets me play :|
Hello FlutterMEDIC : 3
Hi FlutterMEDIC :)
FlutterMEDIC: I know it's by Raubtier.
Teleporter, here!
Yay, streaming!
Eeeerecting a sentry
AJIsAwesome: They were all fire classes that I passed easily. I got my fire academy coming up next :)

Yay, Wrek Sessions!
LT_SKINNY: Nice! :)
And it's on the album De Finns Bara Kreig
FlutterMEDIC: How was it? :)
Thanks! :)
What game?
afk
FlutterMEDIC: you and everyone else who played that game, how was the combat flow though?
FlutterMEDIC: been too busy playing resident evil 6 to play assasions creed 3 :|
Bronysith: ridiculously smooth actually
LadyCanary: Thanks.
FlutterMEDIC: enough to make you forget about the whiny protagonists?
Anybody know when the film lotto will open? It's getting seriously late.
Bronysith: pretty much, along with the ability to shove an axe halfway through a guy's FACE
seriously, ever since evangelion and final fantasy 10, it seems every game or anime company wants their characters to be whiny bitches
FlutterMEDIC: wow
Poom: I SAY IF HE FROM WHERE I WANT TO
:|
Prince_Lightstar: Simmer down.
BRB and all dat other jazz~
Prince_Lightstar, then I am allowed to correct you xD
LadyCanary: o ok nice lady
I can't vote until Thursday? The fuck?!
Deploying smooth jazz in 3, 2, 1........
Bronysith: but what the game really shines in is definitely the naval combat. i mean, THE NAVAL COMBAT IS AWESOME
AJIsAwesome: this is not smooth jazz
Prince_Lightstar: It's a reference. :D
FlutterMEDIC: sounds fun, i just dont have the money to spend on that, saving for conventions
AJIsAwesome: u need more money
?
AJIsAwesome: MONEY
Prince_Lightstar, so does africa.
"We've GOT to have.....money."
Poom: look out guis we have a smart alic
AJIsAwesome: that what such a horrible atrocity of a movie
FlutterMEDIC: True, but I enjoyed it as a kid. :D
Prince_Lightstar, at least I can spell :)
SHUSH

You can tell.
05casue how fast he moves
05plus i met same guy alot earlier before i started streaming

It's morning there.

ROLEPLAYING?
otakon: just no
Like, REAAAALLY early in the morning.
kidzrul732: Hmm, given Wrek's location I'd say it's in the early morning.
It's almost 4am for Wrek.

Attention garnering is against the rules, Forever_Alone. :)
briefly
it's true
that was blatently speedhacking
AJIsAwesome: im not gettin attention
you're trying to
so stuff it and watch the stream
05Forever_Alone: wrong place to attention whore if that is your intent
some guy accused me of hacking after he ran through a mountain and then started runing in place
FOREVER HATED IM GONE
I'd pay attention to the stream, but I don't like metal.
uhhh
Welp, that happened.
pony42532: sounds like lag
Ah, attention whores.
and overreact
Gotta love em.
what a shame
LadyCanary: Eeyup. :D
With a crowbar.
AJIsAwesome: random moment on Bs

i gave up trying to reason with him
bah
thelonepony: Eeyup, we always have them. :D
Well excuuuuuuuuuuuse us, princess!
LadyCanary: My bullet wants a hug.
AJIsAwesome: naw, take it back, BState is always Random

Graphics in this game are lovely.
who knows
I would internet hug the shit out of him.
It's fine thelonepony : 3

otakon: Lol, I believe it.

also awesome mech suit
I want one
Makes me wonder exactly how much money Wrek has and where it all comes from.
Who else start playing for Conglomerate because they have awesome music?
Mike: Nah, Wrek ain't gangsta enough for drugs.
If he ever did drugs I would go over to Sweden and slap him.
XD
otakon: Now THAT makes much more sense for Wrek.
otakon: I'll scope it later.
lol
Now that's what I call Eyecandy
:P
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
Hm.
I downloaded the dub of Kiki's Delivery Service a little while ago. :)
YOU SHONE LIKE THE SUN
The Wall for A/B movie?
Hayao Miyazaki = Storytelling genius.
;-;
We should totally watch The Wall and Song Remains The Same for movie night.
Hell, Hayao Miyazaki = Genius, period.
I was never young. I was hatched from mothergrub as all we here.
it's gonna be a sad day when he passes
Can I ask for your critique on something, guys? :)
FUN FACT: For Phil Hatman's last two roles (Kiki's Delivery Service and Small Soldiers), he played opposite Kirsten Stewart in the lead role in both.
05fun fact: streamign thsi game to you cuts 30 fps
neat fact
AJIsAwesome: shoot
NO WAI
I'm sorry for being uneducated-Who's Hayao Miyazaki?
Mike: WHAT?!
Hey hey, it's okay if he doesnt know.
Mike: Tell me you did NOT just say that.
05i dont know that either
Mike: THE DISNEY OF JAPAN!
05so hush
Wrek: O_o
I may know of his work, just not him.
Wrek: Oh my God...
AJIsAwesome: ask away
:2
:3*
Guys, not everyone is gonna know who he is.
WE MUST REMEDY THIS
He made films such as Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.
Chill. It's not the end of the world.
Castle in the Sky
YES, CASTLE IN THE SKY!!
LadyCanary: -_- say out of this one please
That's my favorite film of his.
Back :)
...What did I do otakon
THAT GUY?!?! I always forget his name. He makes my favorite anime movies like Howl's Moving Castle.
Criticism is welcome, so feel free to address anything that's doesn't fit. :)
http://i.imgur.com/79rkE.png
LadyCanary: chill, not the end of the world. please let me have this one eh?
Welcome back, LT_SKINNY. :)
otakon: Pazu is the closest you will EVER get to a typical Shounen hero in a Miyazaki film.
AJIsAwesome: looks like the average BG pony
Ooooookay.... o3o
05silly you expectign me to knwo him by name
otakon: Alright. Any advice you'd like to suggest? :)
Wrek: Yes. That guy.
Thanks AJIsAwesome :) And is that your OC I spy?
AJIsAwesome: looks okay :3
AJIsAwesome: well some clothes maybe, something you yourself would wear
Wrek: Like I said, most know his work, but not him.
otakon: Okay. Anything else?
Mike: well still, go look up some of his stuff. I recommend Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
otakon: The best scene, though, is when Sheeta falls from the sky and her levitation crystal activates. The music in the English dub (which was redone for orchestra) just made it simply magical.
05onyl seen spirited away of those movies
Otakon: I've already seen Howl's Castle, Spirited Away, and like three others.
AJIsAwesome: If its only beta, then youve got a good framework going. Whats your OC's talent going to be?
aye aye
05but thats cause my sis is a huge anime chick
Wrek: You should see Miyazaki's other work.
Mike: nice, Spirited Away is my personal favorite
Porco Rosso is good too
05meh
LT_SKINNY: Still in development. Any changes you'd consider? :)
castle in the sky : 3......
Grave of the Fireflies is the ONLY Ghibli movie I don't like
Otakon: Howl's Moving Castle for me.
Princess Mononoke was good :)
Porco Rosso is really good, but not his best.
if only bc it's so goddamn depressing
I remember the meme we had here... pazu is a badass :3
ok guys, who else here older than 25?
Man can we do Miyazaki week again?
gdlk_ouo: me
I love Grave of the Fireflies... but I'm not gonna watch it again for a LONG time.
Personally, I'm fourteen.
I HAVE it on VHS.
No shit, I bought the dubbed widescreen VHS and watched that.
Was so sad I could not physically cry.
AJIsAwesome: Hmm... I cant really see anything too blaring. That baby blue mane is a nice compliment to the shade of yellow you chose for your coat :)
Not giving up that tape for a million bucks, though.
AJIsAwesome: nice color scheme, but he's just a bit too plain is all
otakon: Ah, I understand. Any changes/recommendation you'd consider?
Mike: What does Pokemon have to do with Grave of the Fireflies?
AJIsAwesome: is that you in OC? just like i imagined :)
AJIsAwesome: clothing of some kind, even if' it's only a hat
otakon: Yeah, thats pretty much the only thing I can say. Needs moar... moar
Dark92Enigma-: Beta, still in development.
Mike: ;_;
otakon, oh good, i thought i'm the oldest here :)
never watching it again
gdlk_ouo: not by a long shot, we got the venerable Kencolt here as well
he's 50
05i remember watchign this concert with me dad when i was but a kid
05'twas nice
wow
gdlk_ouo: he's an okay guy though, very knowledgable
I'm back

Okay! Okay! Jeezus!! :D

AJIsAwesome: the more you know?
thelonepony: I never knew that.
AJIsAwesome: now you know......
Mike: we had one newbie that was 10 once... haven't seen him in forever actually
KNOWING IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE
And knowing is half the battle!
05im what... 19?

otakon, good, nice hearing there is actual growing mans among us
Isn't there an age limit for this site?

OMG OMG OMG
05reminds me
Dark92Enigma-: And I said oatmeal? Are you crazy?

:O
Been working on a piece of art for a couple of hours. Anybody want to see? http://imgur.com/tTnxK
What, The Tick? I LOVED that show! :D
this is the internet. Their is no age on the internet. age is but a number that marks your inteligence.
pony_6282: let's have a look see
otakon: Pinkie Pie, you are SO RANDOM
not bad
not bad at all
AJIsAwesome: same here :D
:D
Actually, there is age on the internet.

pony_6282: It's not bad. :)
Durrrrrrrr.

05the chat has a restriction of the age of 14
AJIsAwesome: /) loved that show too!
05but ofc
pony_6282: not bad :3

05if you are able to covnersate in a mature and proper manner
scootaflew*
Spypengen: Not really, I'm 14 and I'm more literate and intelligent than some adults I know.
:P
05your age probably doesnt matter
pony_6282: very nice Scootaloo :)
05however most people under 14 are total dickwads
pony_6282: also you might want to use a proper nick though, random pony tabbing is tedious
^
yep
The Rock: IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE IS!
Yeah, my chrome crashed
Wrek: Unfortunately.
Wrek: -_- coming from a 19 year old that doesn'ts ound right
I'll be right back
05otakon: As well may be
I'm back! :)
05but I persoanlly think im able to act properly ;)
Welcome back, Scootaflew. :)
wb Scootaflew yeah, keep practicing
The older we get, the more pessimistic we become about the young :P Life's greatest irony
otakon come on, AVGN is like.....in his 30's and he says worse things
LT_SKINNY: We do? :D
my internet is taking a dump right now
Wrek: Agreed. Alot of people my age and younger are little shits. Sometimes I can't even believe I'm their age.
Wrek: oh not saying that, hell from your maturity from when I first got here I though you were much older
Acually my first picture
whats up Afflict?
Wrek: and British
Scootaflew: For your first picture, it's not that bad. :)
05haha
I'm horrible at recognizing accents
what picture?
Lol, same here otakon
Wrek: I have to go with otakon. I thought you were in your 20s when I first heard your voice.
spypengen: Scootaflew's
Well I did sort of mimic another picture
I actually expected Wrek to be this big, tough fellow.
I feel like I missed something
*Late 20s
05yes im a solid 38, wear top had and other various antiques aswell as conversing in a posh brittish terminology :P
I havent seen said picture
OH GOD.
But the work is all mine
AJIsAwesome: Sure, just look at me. Nearly 20 yrs old and I hate the attitudes of both my younger sister's friends :D
Wrek, indeed, age doesn't matter actually if person are adequate. But most of kids really annoying.
http://imgur.com/tTnxK
Wrek: I need more tea and crumpets.
i agree with AJIsAwesome. i thought you were 24
Theres the pic
