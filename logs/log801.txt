Neither one is mic's channel. That said, they very well could be the same people behind them both, and it seems probable if it is

hey, i got a 27!
you see
doode
high five
i didnt take the ACT
studyin is for nerds
just the SAT
ACT?
(\
great job :D
but in college
I barely got a 26 on my ACT
shit i dont remember the SAT
all two did well i see
When I took the SAT two years ago, I think I got a 2060...
why can't we have musicals like singing in the rain or the music man today?
ACT and SAT are based out of 34
i got a 2170 on my SAT
27/34 isn't bad
sat is based out of a 34?
SAT is out of 2400
2120
^*
Oh fuck, the Sat. Damn it
34 is near impossible to get on the ACT though
And the ACT is out of 36
not 34
well then 36 is near impossible
yeah, I heard its pretty tough to get 25+
Have some opera

no
oops...
but seriously I just finished watching singing in the rain and it made me think

Do the actors today really deserve the praise they have?
Some do
I want more musical dammit

Anyone know the requirement for Princeton?
There arent requirements
*no
Loads of money
Loads of money: uncheck
I was talking about Saturn and he told me I should transfer to england XD
HERE I COME
You just have to fill out the application, get all the forms in, and hope you qualify as an applicant. there arent any "requirements". Applying to college is a rat race
but gosh would I do anything for a good musical
You try to make a flim like that today, with the modern audience of kids-- kids then liked that kind of thing, and well, it was more for the parents at times. TOday? You have a pack of teens wondering where the heck the blood and sex is.
I mean I know there has been Sweeney Todd recently
THERE ARE NO MINIMUMS. JUST BOTTOM PERCENTILES
JEEZ
you have to stand out
I thought it was 6%
something like that
Not to mention the student loans.....
paying off loans are probably hte worst part
^
...why?
^
If you take enough AP classes you can practically skip a few years of collage
suite yourself
30k?
give or take a few thousand
Thats a pretty sizeable loan... :/
^
I can see VT being 30k
no it's sizable
out of state? yes
/me thinks it's halirious his host name is .vt.edu in it XD
?
It helps if you know the teachers at the collage you go to
I dont nkow, it just is
sure
means I cant sneak around under a false nick either
everyone knows it's me

yeah or him
either of you

yes you can

meep
/me as arrived in the middle of something o.o
MEEP
Interesting enough, NGE was one of the first animes I watched when I got back into anime.
hihi
I got into anime through Angel Beats
.-.
LOVED Angel Beats
05,15http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/106/106133.jpg
05,15I saw this earlier and it made me lol
MEEPMEEPMEEP
I only watch moeshit
G-- is back on December the 14th to THe Hub, AND IT'S OFFICIAL
I think my first anime was Sailor Moon via Toonami... good times haha
13ah sailor moon
I loved Angel Beats as well.
05,15I never watched Sailor Moon
upotte
and strike witches
The chatroom is going to break during Season 3 Episode 7 because of ---'s trumphiant return
come the fuck at me
First anime I ever watched was Dragonball, if I recall.
do i detect spoilar |u
I was 4
I just finished Gunslinger Girl and that was pretty good
Oh, I LOVED Yu-Yu-Hakisho.
u|
|u
:O Yu-yu-Hakisho, loved it lol
God*
05,15Then I stopped watching anime for years. Been trying to get back into it for a while now
>8v....
oh fuck
how could I forget that
also baccano
first anime i watched was sailor moon.
Anyone else here dislike watching dubbed anime?
hah
I still need to watch Nichijou, that show is cute. :D
yes.
together
^
Nichijou looks good
wait
or fansubs
huge difference
^^^^^
the first mange i read was chobits.
http://derpy.me/BTi7K the sun is getting larger
Boondocks. Nuff said
05,15same with Gurren Lagann
05,15I liked that one about ghosts that they when they dubbed it, they changed it and turned it into a comedy
05,15Because that's how I know those characters
^
I'm not enough of a weaboo
not dedicated enough
05,15Good luck. you need like over 2000 hours to become even somewhat proficient
oh fuck I forgot railgun and index
Bu dui
watch both of those
no prob lol
05,15Mandarin or Cantonese?
Mandarin
05,15Cantonese is clearly the correct answer
no
05,15Because Hong Kong is best pony
lol
nonono
no longer
Then why are you here?
^
oh
because I still have friends on this network
Really? That's... counter intuitive.
I have never thought of that
05,15Why are you making chocolate pudding?
it was the S2 premiere
That makes sense I guess.
I did in fact
:3 was a time a man could cook at 4 am without losing control
^
I dont know when that was, myself
"bronies" get on my fucking nerves sometimes
:(
but meh, don't hate the show or the fans or anything

Friends are over-rated.
I havent had friends since high school lol

05,15All my friends are the ones from high school. I haven't made any in college
I'm trying to make some friends in college atm.

My college's official (recognized by the university) is somewhere around 25 or something

You missed 'know'
.....damnit
He also payed from the shipping from WeLoveFine.com to Australia

I rarely talk to anyone, coworkers get a bit of conversation from me, but thats it
:D

Still not working, buddy.
/me why are we talking about italics?

I just see it as a slash on lightiRC.
/me because they look cool
13it has always existed
13okay i have to share how awesome this mix is
*This* is emphasis, I generally use it instead of italics
05,15KrazyNoobs gosh....I wanna say.....March of 2011. I may be wrong

Agreed

ALL HAIL GAK
Hah
We still got about a week and a half before that music becomes relevant.
I am of course referring to the Dec 21 2012 bullcrap
oh that
I heard it's happening the 12th
you know, 12/12/12 and all that crap
I thought it was the 21st.
bah it's rubbish
Yeah, the 21st.
Of course it is.
it's rubbish regardless
But I've been hearing about this date since '99.
lol
the ticket for that day i mean
hi

all I want is to see my Subscriptions Uploads in my feed

it's all bullshit son
13except those predictions don't take the gregorian calendar's modifications into account
13the mayan calendar rolled over in like 2006
Man, I heard about Y2K in 1999. That's only one year of build up
ahem bollocks?
13eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
Not even, I think I heard about Y2K in October
DAMN YOU EXHAUSTION!
/me brings up Y2038
lol
It's a real problem.
13the 32bit unix timestamp overflow
Y2k was only a problem for crappy systems.
00,10piffff unix
crap
That only crappy people used in 2000.
only 26 years before that
13uh every system in the world that uses unix timestamps needs to be using the 64bit version by then
Actually, the Mayan Calendar is one of like 100 "prophecies". Of course they're all bullocks. But that don't change that I've had the date drilled into my head for 13 years.
The 2038 problem is deeply embedded in protocols.
And all 32bit code uses 32bit time by default.
I think before that the longest I had thought about a date in the future was Halo: Reach's release date.

Alright thanks. :)
elfen lied is AWESOME.
But back to the point.
We need 64bit miliseconds.
whoa haha
300k years
And milisecond accuracy.
13much much longer than that
13300 million
13like 297,000,000 plus change
No clue
00,10no I ment if you showed Elfin
13oh elfen lied?
13one of the characters has a stepfather that rapes her
13did i mention the character is no more than ten?
That too.
13she runs away and that's the important part of the arc
00,10oh is that all
well shit. okay
13no the prologue is
I totally forget.
13the first six minutes are a naked girl utterly destroying high ranking military
The prologue is a naked girl walking around killing everyone.
Well either way, I feel like I should watch this with you or on my own . It just keeps showing up
She uses huge invisble arms
13elfen lied is a good series that brings up important points
Eh, I don't really like that show.
I highly reccomend watching elfen lied.
13speaking of anime i should block out three hours and finish our series soon
It's a good anime. If a bit sad.
I can't do sad
Grave of the Fireflies ruined me
RUINED ME
00,10Law of Hemoglobin Capacity

13oh it touches on that too
O_O
NOOOOOOOOOO
00,10Law of Transient Romantic Unreliability
00,10Minmei is a bimbo.
13KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Geez, that scene was......interesting.
Closest I've seen in squick is Strait Jacket near the end
i like anime when they cry.
;_;
Project A-ko was my first "real" anime
00,10I streamed Strait Jacket here once
it was interesting
00,10heh
13someone's been playing thaumcraft
That magic sucks
.......
apparently it can happen slowly too with just build up
13did i mention elfen lied also features animal abuse as a device to build the protagonist?
Steampunk meets Wizards meets Godzilla kind of
13elfen lied is by no means a light series
I don't remember that.
13marimba rules
yeah he's using Sorcery for surgery
his Cast busts
he mutates in his suit and then rampages
00,10OAV but yeah
*a
yeah the thing is in that world, sorcery is only dangerous to those PRACTICING IT
00,10well and every one in the area when they go out of control
if you're a normal person, the Malediciton(magical pollution) has no affect on you
13rasse ra rasse ra rasse rasse rasse ra

Never

I have to go to school shortly =_=
Well, my lighter drinks. Any time I had liquor, I was out with my friends or my husband back when we were still dating. :D
yes!
but that means i cant take my meds that night..
Yeah, alcohol + meds = really really bad
# Cider cider cider cider #
on mood meds :\
Hard cider! Yeah!
I still have some cider, come to think of it...
you think i should wait till my parents home that night or?
I usually have some rum lying around...
All this talk about booze when there is a 15 year old in the room XD
What's rum like?
should i drink during the day
or wait
I would say you shouldn't drink at all, but if you do, don't get drunk
i would end up in the hospital if i got drunk
since meds
Why didn't anyone say hi to me ;AAA;
Yeah
I don't see the point in getting drunk, but there's alot out there that can taste really nice
good enough?
00,02XD
Hi guys, I'm back
00,02reliable snapshot overflow

lol
Hehe
I don't like getting drunk, but- each their own
I like the taste of vodka, but never had enough to get drunk
since i on meds
meaning i would skip my meds that night
I hate parties-
Plus it gives you an excuse to get off with really hot guys without feeling like a slut >>>
Ha
lol
Parties are awesome! D:
I don't feel comfortable with being drunk, It freaks me out
I don't even drink at concerts, because I want to enjoy the music fully
Just "Dat Jaymo"

if it's too hot you're outta luck
Nah, you just get in the ocean!

And spray yourelf with Canadian squirt guns and things
ocean has seaweed
beach is also always full of kids and weird old men
We're having cold heat debate.

well, then it Luna. Luna is cool. :3
awwww
yup
cause people
are
MORONNNNNS
FUCKING IDJIOTS
lol
Heres one example
A bunch of airlines closed
IDJIOTS
lol
IDJIOTS EVERYWHERE IT FUCKING BURNS
lol
The the piolits go on strike because tthere arent enough jobs
The fuck
Uh.
Misinformed much?
The reason Hostess went under isn't because lolunionsareevul
They kind aare
It's because Hostess wanted the workers to take ANOTHER pay cut.
When shit goes down they dont protect you
No one streaming? D:
IDJIOTS
Plus people seem to think THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING being a union
Over and over and over again.
And they were finally fed up with making less money for doing more work.
Well
13less money?
13they were making $16 an hour
Now they have NO FUCKING MONEY
13for assembly line work
13that's on TOP of benefits
thousands are making no money at all
cause of IDJIOTS
If you're going to be impolite I'm not going to bother having this conversation.
13but the union picked a retarded time to push for a strike
Why are all the higher up people morons?
13because the government is set up to let them
why
Cause higher ups requires idiocy
are they busy
Would it be considered blasphmey to act intelegent?
only idjiots can be politicians
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBlw4C6rzDo
13CriticKitten: the problem is in this economy it's pretty dumb for the union to say NO WE WANT MORE when they're already making quite a lot more than similar unskilled work
Their management was a pack of wild idiots. Sure, the strike came at a terrible time, but blaming the union for this and no one else?
Is just outrageously silly.
13everyone involved was stupid
hey, i was wandering already for a long time: whats needed for to stream?
and now everyone fucking suffers
13high management took a gamble on investments and blew it, and left lower management holding the bag
In this econemy people need jobs
13lower management absolutely had to make more money otherwise the company would fold
They threatened to walk if they didnt get off
They can be easily replaced
and hostess threatened to close down
/me shrugs
AND NOW THEY CLOSING
13liquidating
But Hostess's management, again, was too stupid to just say "okay, you're all fired".
13true that
13that may have been in part from the pressure from the other unions
And just hire people willing to take the jobs.
Maybe. Doesn't excuse them from some blame IMO.
13no but it's enlightenment
Which is why if anyone threatens to walk, I'll say BUH BYE
Not really
'cuz that's how compromise works.
13or that congress passing only a couple laws in a term is a BAD thing
One side getting all the power totally makes democracy work right?
THAT WE PAY FOR
It isnt free you chucklefucks!
13well not just that
/me snorts
13there's also the OMFG THE REPUBLICANS ARE EVIL crowd
13no mccain was a terrible candidate
I didn't vote for him this year, though.
I dont see the problem with Romney
Because I was fucking pissed that he extended the Patriot Act.
Wait, you guys didn't vote for Celesta/Luna? I'm disappointed...
Palin was part of the reason I didn't pick McCain actually, yeah.
13so when you have a media industry dedicated to tearing apart everything not-Democrat, we turn the other cheek because we think it's the right thing to do
He stammers and went uh alot
I'm not entirely convinced Romney did either. >_>
The town hall debate especially.
They both avoided questions like the plague
huh...
11,02Bronysith: They are on the homepage
Also them saying Romney is gonna give old people a voucher system is bullshit
Ello
Obama's way is OH you're too old you dont need medical aid
13CriticKitten: i get the sense the issue there was it's largely ryan's plan
Likely, because Romney really dodged on specifics there and that hurt him a lot.
Hi.
13yep
hey
13between President Um and Candidate It's-My-VP's-Plan we still got shafted this election
13flaria changed nicks!
I did.
Shafted might be too generous of a word.
13royally hosed
13flaria <3
ambassador incident?
the diplomats I mean
13benghazi?
That one i think
Which probably means the next election....ugh.

All the elections anymore are just getting worse and worse.
oh hey, i think i might have heard someone once mention that
Therte were barely any guards and they KNEW they were beefing up ANTI AMERICAN SECURITY
This election was a choice between a socialist and capitalist businessman. Seeing we're in a recession and many people hate business-types, it was the socialist FTW.
13http://i2.minus.com/izNgEu8bI8QDN.png
asshole
11,02Shizuka: But...that's not a house D:
At least Romney isnt going to make everyone buy healthcare
NOT EVERONE NEEDS IT
stupid choice
going to die for nothing
13unions work when they actually need to defend their workers
>Need to getmoney to get out of a rescession

13SuperBrony64: is just the framework for now
13it's a nice spot though

Hi everybody :)

Detroit's not great either, but they're pretty bad in terms of kids too.
I'm still searching for something I can handle. Way too fucking hard to find work nowadays. I'm having the state do it.

For disabled people like me, it's a barrier too high for jobs.

When you're good at something---*
13SpadeKyurem: not much, it's just CPU and RAM intensive
It's why I've chosen to go with disability placement, but even they may not find me anything.
How intensive?
13discrete graphics helps but in the end it's Java that'll hold you back
That doesn't mean the presidency is meaningless, but having a good mix in Congress is critical.

She expects me to read The Great Gatsby and write a 900-1500 word essay in a week

THEORY: Ponies are actually hundreds of feet larger than humans and the "My Little Pony" from the title is spoken from Celestia's POV. Discuss.

hi
<_<
lurk on, #bronystate
I got mine
I look fucking adorable
Do you have the link to his deviantart because i left before he finished mine
sure hold on
NO NO NO
HE CHALLEGES FACTS
whats the first?
With best theme ever
Ponies, of course
no
ponies, though amazing, no where near the best show ever
meh
08,01Bronysith: aye
Ponies are good, but I'm not sure I'd count them in the top 10 best ever shows. Not even sure about top 10 cartoons.
Quantity=/=quality
Speaking entirely objectively on the matter.
Its the longest running FOR A REASON
08,01it does give scifi a bad name, in my opinion
does current simpsons suck
Ill be the last person to say Quantiy is the same as quality
But DW is the longest running for a reason
My favourite Simpsons episode is from season 2... Just sayin'...
season 2? really?
I think it's season 2, yeah.
no
uhm
simpsons was really REALLY REALLY FUCKING GOOD
not saying its humor is the same
before simpsons had its own creative humor
Yeah, season 2.
current simpsons sucks
Simpsons WAS the greatest animated series, but todays doesnt compare to the older episodes
todays simpsons episodes purely suck
down
but the simpsons just needs to end
End it with another movie
I'm thinking between inkscape and paint too sai
For illustration I use Inkscape.
kthx

Was brilliant, turned into shit grind.
DSFSDf dslfjskfj skdfjkafnkadfndsf he didn't upload mine
hey everypony :)
wat
why is south park still good?
cause they do all the things that i was just complaining about with current simpsons
but its good CAUSE THE WRITING IS GOOD
well I like to use Inkscape for diagrams a lot :_
:)
nothing like SVG diagrams!
Well I'll keep pts on hand, but I'll try out inkscape.
most of the time I see people drawing in photoshop with tablets
animaniacs is just
pure
fun
Animatiacs were awesome.
amen
you cant watch that show without smiling
no i dare you
no I'll just put some money in winrar and send the file to you.
no
Wouldn't*
It can never come back
too much substance abuse
I can't type. =(
most of the writers went their own ways
animaniacs is just pure fun, but then
that show is just
epic
if they DO make a comeback, the intro has to start off telling us all that we've waited long enough for the 101 episode
My brain is full of fuck right now. i can barely think straight
suck
Amen.
no idea

with a sundy
She's cute.
/me prances around with a decently high fever ^_^
If I had ANY talent in drawing, I wouldn't use a pony creator. But alas, I have none.
Plus, would make it easier for other artists to draw it.
.....I made my OC using pony creato and use it as a reference for the colors when i finally draw it....
does that make me a bad person?
no
no it does not
no it doesnt lol
i just dont like pony creator oc's xD
me too
hmmmmmm....

We even have stereotypes for ourselves! We're that pessimistic
though stereotypes and racism is developed from experience
and for sometimes good reason
:p
that is still developed
experiences, etc
I hate that more than anything

REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
Hm.
YOU SHONE LIKE THE SUN
The Wall for A/B movie?
Hayao Miyazaki = Storytelling genius.
;-;
We should totally watch The Wall and Song Remains The Same for movie night.
I was never young. I was hatched from mothergrub as all we here.
it's gonna be a sad day when he passes
neat fact
NO WAI
I'm sorry for being uneducated-Who's Hayao Miyazaki?
Hey hey, it's okay if he doesnt know.
05i dont know that either
05so hush
I may know of his work, just not him.
:2
:3*
WE MUST REMEDY THIS
He made films such as Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.
Chill. It's not the end of the world.
Castle in the Sky
YES, CASTLE IN THE SKY!!
That's my favorite film of his.
