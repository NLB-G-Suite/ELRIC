I like fics with OCs in them, but not fics ABOUT OCs
Because you cant fucking expect everything not to have something used befofre in it
I hate Mary sues
05,15I can expect the world/characters/plot to be though
My OC...is me ponified...i dont even plan to do anything with it :D

"Daddy was just breaking and entering, sweetheart."

how could they do that?
Just misunderstood
13and the matrixes i streamed at the start of trilogy summer
>Nuke a facility

... Naaaah

Bay cameras are the worst
SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Welp
This computer sucks~
Dat symbolism

Thats for sure

ooh
More sand
WHY DONT THEY CHECK
Anyone want to see the build I just made up and geek out about it with me? :3
THE WORLD'S GREATEST TOTHBRUSH!
Guarded ONLY by a barbed wire fence
And yet they believe that the facility is secure enough that "it's probably just a bird" in that sand pile.
How annoying. o.ó
If you saw a disturbance in a experiment like this would you go check it?
yes
This is hilarious.
I really hate this computer~
did you know that he now works like a swarm of bees there is one grian of sand that is basically the queen
And why exactly do they have a facility like that guarded by a sole chainlink fence?
. . .
*whine* ;;
Yes, this is happening. XD
i'm guessing the sand was just for a base
ROCKS
sand
sand actually
Lets not take them for granite

Bum bum bum bum
Awwww

Good point, why isn't he HORRIFIED at this?
sad scene
and just be sand, and scatter to the oceans.
If that was me, I'd panic.
Then panic some more.
Faint.
And then go back to panicking.
Did I mention I would panic?
Why does everyone complain about this movie?
HARSH

05,15Spidey forgot how physics worked and killed Gwen
Haha more ANGST
and the innocence of comics died with her or something
gwen stacy should have been in the first movie...and died
He's a cop... of course he's there
05,15Yeah, that was a huge moment because the Hero never fails
^
I haven't seen "The Amazing Spiderman" yet, is it good?
gwen should die in the next movie
05,15Best character in these movies
DerpyWhoovesYES
HAHA Daily Bugle

05,15The more you know
How did she not die from the force of falling that far?
05,15yup
dear heavens.
SpadeMagnes: In the comics, Spidey saved Gwen from a fall off a bridge, but her neck snapped.
60 ft i think?
05,15Read that bit of info after they shot a bunch of civilians by accident a few months ago
Being caught regardless she would have died from force of stopping
. . .

Well, Ill brb

Cya everypony

Isnt Symbiote supposed to beefy?
also venom is kind of a freak in that most symbiots kill there hosts
AND WHERE IS THE EVIL VOICE
Hi!
We ALL wanna kill the Spiderman!
np
HEY it's foreplay
Venom's supposed to be beefy as heck.
Wasnt symbyote brock beeffy?
*beefy

andOMG rifftrax! I loveshizu
And why doesnt he have the creepy voice?
brock was also beefy before the symbiote
ha
They went with turkey jerky it looks like to me....
venom is buffer than brock by quite a bit
13quick, out of nowhere let's have a protracted action sequence
Wait
oh yes a kidnapping fixes EVERYTHING
How did this happen?
best part of the movie, anyway
Do they ever explain this?
No kidnapping scene?
No nothing?
I keep expecting to hear Blige eerytime someone says Mary Jane
it's not very impressive
LOL SOME PIG!
when did this become charlotte's web
well everypony i have to go
bye bye
13suddenly he's gouda!

get help from enemy over ironman or the fantastic four
HE WAS IN THE CENTER OF A EXPLOSION
1-800-FUCK-YOU
In this segment the Buddha doesn't deserve his help
Because he's magic. :D

And the butler decides to stop being an idiot
YOU ARE FIRED
Alfred ripoff?
13and then for no particular reason the butler picks NOW to tell him
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8127/ this whole entire universe of Spiderman.
WHY DIDHE NOT EXPLAIN THIS WAY EALIER
Worst. Alfred. EVER.
Because he's a fucking idiot
:D
13you should have told him that TWO MOVIES AGO
this is he only good part.
butler is best hero.

Not saying much.
Okay.
Plot conveinience?
should be ded
13yeah but it's a comic book
Oh look he landed in SAAAAAND
and then he broke every bone in his body
i thought venom wasnt a villan (people at school told me) :'(
venom's character traits change over the years
Boss battle!
:D
Well gee, it's a good thing those webs are strong enough to hold steel....oh wait never mind, this film keeps forgetting that factoid
Fight!
wat.
You got eyes in my sand!
Eddie Brock is Anti-Venom
Were any of the Venoms "good" in any sense?
For god's sake, we get it, writer. You like the Mummy. A lot.
Was that supposed to be a laugh?
Deadpool, the normal universe one, is FREAKING. AWESOME.
HE DIED DAMMIT!!!
Spiderman needs a sword or something

MJ.... move to freaking St. Kitts and Nevis. Retire. You deserve it.
xD

I can't help but laugh at Peter's torn mask :D
3-hit combo
STOP THAT
It looka like a terrible fashion trend. :D
Eddie's stupid face <<<<<<<<< Venom's face
Amnesia XD
Do they actually make these jokes as they watch the movie? Or do they just edit all of this in?
well, he just broke every bone in his body
or atleast his neck
FATALITY
13Sebiale: they do some preparation, otherwise they're recording while they watch
Okay, that part is meaningful.

Yep, Venom killed with ONE grenade
He threw a Samus Aran bomb at it
*implied
Beef Blastbody
He didn't ask for this
venom is one of the most resilent characters in the marvel universe
>mangles metal rods

08,01ooo! i have an idea
/me 08,01logs into the compute server and does make -j64
XD
Saturn, you know much about apache?
08,01wow
05Phase4:there is no point in investign in an army if you cant support it
08,01okay, my compile is running real fast now
08,01Phase4: i know a lot about apache
05and you can mass them up for defence
Saturn, php-fpm + apache2, how does
My computer sucks.
08,01magic?
Magnets
I'm out of tea... Must make more!
magic *snort**snort*
Why
08,01Phase4: normally just apt-get install php-fpm
Saturn, it didnt autoconfig
08,01hm
08,01are you using nginx?
thats where my music went
Saturn, apache, i'm proxying through nginx
Saturn, pastebin?
08,01aye
Saturn, http://pastebin.com/wae30U40
08,01Phase4: i think you have a .htaccess rule overriding it
08,01that'd be my first guess
no .htaccess file
08,01hmm
08,01no 404s or anything
you going to ariscop.net or www.ariscop.net
cause ariscop.net is just the default site right now
08,01ah, okay
Ahh, Ultra-luxe theme
in the document root
08,01oh wait
08,01no, that's not it
ok, its definantly not invoking php
/me <3 strace
08,01i was about to suggest strace \o/
08,01are you sure php5.fcgi is in /usr/local/www?
08,01just seems odd you'd put it there, rather than /usr/www
why is it looking for index.pl
Saturn, there is no /usr/local/www
08,01ah
the site said it didnt need to exist
[pid 1395] stat("/usr/local/www/fastcgi/php5.fcgi/index.php", 0x7fff7bf28f00) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
08,01i think
i think its just ignoring the handler
i don't see why apache would check for that file before telling php
/me Looks at clock
/me sighs "Gotta go" :<
Bye guys
08,01or at least as an argument

Hey Everypony! :)
Saturn, no, nginx config is wrong
08,01hmm, you have a lot of ports filtered
it might be actually
openvz vps
08,01ah, okay
08,01some interesting things going on with port 53 too

I like Sublety like i´n Citiocen Kane, the way most animes do it is over the top, unless it's something like Hellsing, where it is Hillariously over the top
