13no and never will
vat next
and when i say that i mean that i convinced you to tlet me paint cute little panda bears on all of your toenails
05,15b-but I don't know how this happened
fluttercry: its all because of the soda
Shizuka: Hey, that's kool.
You were sleepwalking.
Shizuka But... You're a robot...
Sleep...you know what I won't finish that.
I've heard your robot voice!
Shizuka values her privacy.
DashWithRainbows: um no... RX is the robot
dumbass
Bronysith: yu gi oh abridged?

My voice is annoying. If you have ever played TF2 with me you have most likely heard it ;A;

THe only talking Shizuka will do on stream is through a pyro mask :D
Shizu is a robot and runs Bronystate out of her head. This has been discussed, guys.

Shizuka: is a ninja
Bronysith: y u kill me
Reikim: fuck governement really
...I miss TV streams :c
StinkomanFan: me too
If we knew anything about Shizu we'd all get abducted by men in black suits and tossed into some kind of weird illegal experiment facility.
I like talking through the mic while playing TF2 but my face still remains a mystery. That is if you have ever Skyped me or met me at Canterlot Gardens :P
Lol, Reikim :D
And then some of us would get superpowers and break out and form a super-team fighting agains the government and everything would be awesome.
I rarely use my mic on tf2
My dream is to someday go to Bronycon :3
I let my guns do the talking :D
Ponies47: Me too.
RaveBrony: I do. You've heard mah voice ;3;

Yeah, L4D is stil $20, thats how good it is :D
>Buy L4D2

Canadian_Brony, you have only one brain, though. If you can juggle your attention between the stream, your homework, and your game and be done with your homework tonight, that's good.

00,03But when I do... I play as Zoey
NOOOO!!!!!!!! But at least it will carry on through through the fans
fluttercry they wouldn't cancel the show this early. They're making waty too much money to even consider the idea.
05,15I wonder if I photoshopped that into Hasbro's Twitter if EQD would post it
I fear....the fans work....
lol
It may be good!! But easily corrupted
00,03...do it
they probably would
inb4 fluttercry isn't really a fan and is just a huge troll
fluttercry is joking, just to be 100% sure?
So if they're not announcing the Season 3's premier, they're close to breaking their promise.
Oh god :D
05,15Think about it. When FiM does get cancelled, all we'll have are fan episodes like that last one
hell, it'd be immediate news
fluttercry: DO EET
oh boy
Dusk's Crappy Half-Assed Project
Quality with a capital WHY
fluttercry: N...noooo ._.
fluttercry, what makes you think FiM is getting cancelled?
00,03Dat fan episode was the most MLG thing ever, srsly. It's that bad
05,15Oh man, I want to try that Twitter thing now
Fan ep?
Been off for too long
fluttercry what "last one"?
fluttercryto be honest, if they would've got some better VAs and worked on the plot a bit more, it would've been ok
fluttercry: Well maybe we do have better ones like Double Rainboom
^
HoodyNinja: If you want a good laugh, look it up :D
not even morgan freeman's sezy pants soaking vocal chords could've salvaged that
00,03fluttercry, if that worked, I would not be in your way when you become President of Everything
If you want a good laugh, look up My Little Portal -_-
O.o
I will!
HoodyNinja: Oh that.
I saw My Little Portal. It's good stuff.
Which fan episode are guys talking about?
Dusk Dawn
05,15You know what I hate? Pony crossovers
The bad ones :D
Wrek you still around?
00,03Don't even get me started on the My Little Dashie movie that was realeased a while ago...
I hate the animation, the plot, and the voice acting
in essence, everything
-_-, if you haven't already check out rainbow factory.
They made a movie of that?
fluttercry: Hmm?
DerpyMuffins oh thank Celestia. I was getting worried you were talking about Turnabout Storm
00,03It wasn't even a movie at all!
Scoot-Scootaloo what was it?
it was released?
O.o
How can you make a movie out of a fanfic?
yay, we should watch the Dusk's Dawn episode ^_^
Already?
I thought that was a trailer that wasn't supposed to be a movie
00,03A bunch of images
05,15Dusky NO
the mlp fim ending isnt true right?
05,15We already suffered that once
fluttercry: but why?
^
05,15superretroworld That's what I read. Sorry
see, RaveBrony agrees!
superretroworld: Never
fluttercry, I just looked at The Hub's facebook page (and I'm kicking myself for even touching FB). The image IS from there.
No, rofl!
:p
thats okay
RaveBrony: but it's such a good laugh
Ive seen it twice now :D
It just hurts, hahaha
I had the luck of not seeing Dusk Dawn
just steals the septor with a stretcheer
/me isn't sober \o/
Was on too late when mods streamed it
is this 2 or 1?
So glad I was
Scoot-Scootaloo oh, I know which one you're talking about. Yeah, there are dozens of "MLD Movies" that are really slide shows, but an actual movie, as in MOTION PICTURES, is in develoment.
/me is wondering why hes sober
apparently 1 beer is all ti takes
>_<
Weakling
Alright guys. If the premier is before the election, I'm calling off my pony fast... or maybe I'll make an exception for ONLY new episodes as they air.
05,15MLD is a movie? my god what has this world become
DerpyMuffins: well, the last time I was drunk there was a network attack that I was too drunk to defend against
Would you vote for a president just because he is a brony?
fluttercry: Don't be a hipster
DerpyMuffins: No.
zombie bullshit!
05,15HoodyNinja not my fault it's bad
Is he white?
and the time before that my campsite got raided by a wolf that I couldn't scare off
so I don't usually drink
DerpyMuffins: Why would I do that just because we share the same interests?
As much as I want, I cant get drunk anymore....
but getting kidnapped out to super by my mother's bf kinda qualifies as a time IU need a drink
fluttercry an actual movie is being made. I'm not talking pictures either. People are going out of their way to shoot a legitimate movie out of the fan-fic.
05,15Canadian_Brony what a shame.
. . .
Who is streaming?
Shizu/
Whats teh budget?
wait
dare i ask what fanfic?
05,15MLD Buytoast
MLD
05,15MLD
if it's that ovverated dashie thing
godadmmit
Buytoast My Little Dashie
My Little Dashie
05,15I know right?
;~;
Ponies47 hwo bad was it?
MLD is overrated now
/me liked MLD
^
oh god
the thank you commercial
it hurts
05,15Next thing you know they'll be binding and selling Fallout: Equestria OH WAIT THEY DID
Dken2021: Shush. That would be spoiling it
it hurts it hurts it hurts
MY LITTLE DASHY, MY LITTLE DASHY, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I heard a fan gave a MLP VA a copy of that
I enjoyed MLD!! but i hate how everyone has blown it out of proportion
^
^^
MY LITTLE DASHY, I used to wonder what depression could be
05,15MLD is overated and crap
Oh hey, Left 4 Dead.
Until you shared it's magic with me
13see
Ya'll will have to wait
/me uses a Bat Creditcard
13you guys think i wouldn't help my teammates
I think you guys are just mad that this isn't an inside joke thing anymore, that or you just don't like fan fiction
13but would YOU help your teammates if they were this dumb?
shoot them all dead Shizuka
you can do it
and noone would know
no
Not really Shizuka
05,15AIs don't deserve life
SpadeMagnes[R]: ...........
brony thank you was a fail
all a fail
Anyway, I'm a little late hearing this, but I saw the EQD post about tomorrow's Big News.
Whatever it is, I am freaking ready.
05,15HoodyNinja I dislike fanfiction, but I especially dislike MLD
Brony thank you?
Marx: Big News tomorrow?
inb4 they were bought out be e3
Knowing how EQD would I really enjoy what big news they show?
*is
by EA
*
I...dont like reading...so...im not a fan of fanfiction :I
fail :P
My dad is awesome .
That is all
wut?
05,15I love reading and that's why I hate fanfiction
Well, they're AIs. They only shoot as straight as they're allowed to be, and their tactics are only as sound as their designed to be.
My dad is ok. he can just be a bully when it comes to school ._.
fluttercry: Poor writing?
I realized I bought Skyrim 3 days ago and still havent touched it
My dad is a jobless loser
but I still love him
05,15No creativity. make you own damn world. Don't be lazy
Only reading I do on my own is reading microwave cooking directions :D
Oh come on there are some good fanfictions
lol
05,15lol no there aren't
I heared Past Sins was good
I love my dad, but he loses fate on me ._.
You're acting like every single one is bad... and how do you know that
i don't know what i'm ashamed of more
BACKGROUND PONY, AND FAMILIES
05,15Because every single one I've read or that has been presented as a "Really good one" has sucked terribly
DerpyMuffins: its not really a fun game
the fact that i've actually written some or the fact taht i had one on Sir Dragonfister's Plateau of Horse Shinanigans
Pinkie watches paint dry was great
I'm just gonna step away from this fan fic argument
fluttercry: what about stuff like antipodes? it take the world, changes it, and adds new characters
WOW! LOOK AT THOSE PIXELS!
my face hurts
05,15Still not their own world
fluttercry: Does that apply to just MLP fanfiction, or fanfics in general (Like the Sonic fanfics that Dan Drazen wrote)?
fluttercry: Oh god could you sound anymore of a ass right now?
Wtf internet.
Wat is he doin'?
05,15J_E_Smith71 fanfiction in general. SpadeMagnes[R] Just being honest
Google image search
I liked the "Twilight War" fluttercry, but that is mostly cause I liked the military aspects of it. Too bad it never got finished.
Why
fluttercry: is that all you care about?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzlyscTLPK1qksdgwo2_500.jpg
Oh damn
WAH someone doesn't like what i like they're an ass WAH
What the fuck is wrong with that pic that I posted?
Oh look, he's dying.
Barbetos: WUT
Buytoast: No the problem is their being negative as fuck
I don't know!
Y'know a REALLY controvercial fanfic?
13he?
/me cries
05,15I have the right to be negative
negativity is a part of reality
you can't just ignore it
The Conversion Bureau
fluttercry: most books dont even create their own world anyways. Stuff like Tom Clancy takes place on the earth. Does that mean Clancy books are bad?
Hes not really being negative
The biggest problem I see in fanfictions is originality. And I'm not talking about what fluttercry is saying. A lot of fanfictions I find tell the same stories over and over and over. Take "Human in Equestria" stories. "HiE" and "original" is non-existent.
Well there has to be good stuff out there, your acting like every single one in exsistence is horrible
Buytoast, but you can fight it
Good to see Shizuka helping her teammates
why fight it?
05,15Real life isn't the same as another fictional world that was already created by someone else
in fact
Why contain it?
Do people type "fluttercry: " themselves or do they do something else?
Negativity is an attitude, not a reality
Canadian_Brony: Originality? In fan fiction?
are you saying attitudes don;t exist?
IT"S ALL ABOUT THE SHIPS
fluttercry: do you mean someone like avatar, pocahontas and dances with wolves having the same stories?
Its more like stubborn, but i would like to stay out of dis
Type part of their name, and push tab DerpyWhooves.
fluttercry: well Its the same to me. They are both taking a pre-existing world (earth, equestria) and adding their own twist to it.
05,15superretroworld yeah sort of.
binders, full of women
DerpyWhooves, I type part of his name and tab
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Thanks.
Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars are the best is examples of horrible fan fiction.
DerpyWhooves no. You begin to type out a nick and hit 'tab' to finish it. If the right nick doesn't come up at first, hit it until you get it.
DerpyWhooves, type the first few characters of a username then hit tab
oops beat me to it.
What game is this>
L4D
Left 4 Dead
moobull69: My god, you been gone for a lomg time
long*
BRB shower
People always get my name wrong tho
HoodyNinja extremely rare, and almost doesn't exist in HiE.
Ponies47|Shower: Covers the cameras!
O i didnt reconize it, i want it really bad
sometimes, I hurt my foot on monday, and haven't been doing much
People always do "Derpy_hooves" for me.
o_O
Canadian_Brony: Than don't write/read any
get yo own ideas
DerpyWhooves it's called a 'tab-fail'.
I got my own ideas
I'm going to write a fanfic right now.
brb
Originality is difficult to find on Fim
I dont like any sort of fanfiction.
true
Most people just write about OCs and shit
"Here's a touching story"
Not everything has to be 100% origional you know...
I hate OC fics
BP and families aregood though
05,15SpadeMagnes[R] um...why not?
DIS MY OC WHIP WIGGLE HE OWN WHIP AND CATERPILLAR
SHIP NOW PLS
I like fics with OCs in them, but not fics ABOUT OCs
05,15MY OC IS A ALLICORN AND SHE IS BETTER THAN CELESTIA
Because you cant fucking expect everything not to have something used befofre in it
I hate Mary sues
05,15I can expect the world/characters/plot to be though
...isn't all of FiM fanfiction(Lauren Faust is a MLP fan)
SO MANY F******* ALICORNS!!!!!!!!!! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
My OC...is me ponified...i dont even plan to do anything with it :D
fluttercry: YOU ARE NOT THE THIRD SISTER
HoodyNinja I read fanfictions, but I'm able to weed through them and find the ones that appeal to me.
05,15Sure there are tropes and cliches but that's different
thelonepony don't we all?
No more L4D? D:
13what to do
My OC is an earth pony ;~;
Shizuka streaming all she can before she leaves
13eeyup
maybe i should reinstall L4D one of these days
For the weekend
Shizuka: Bill Nye?
stream-o-thon
Tetris
then again
I'm working on my own sci-fi franchise, but I'm thinking up my own FiM fanfic as well.
tl2
Didi you draw your OC HoodyNinja ?
I request tetris
Coach is quite endearing
Did*
thelonepony: actually yes
05,15I vote Spongebob
Shizuka should stream the Riftrax for Spiderman three :|
Could i see it :3
00,03You should draw a pony, Shizu!
We should watch MLP
13scoot you do not want to see my drawing fail..
draw a sea pony
G1
Just keep in mind that I'm 34, so it's going to be less Mary-Sue-oriented.
I vote for a tutorial on how to bake bread!!
How about we do something Shizuka likes....
^
00,03You should bake a cake, then!
^^^
magnets
The cake is a lie
so we can know how the ywork
show some Donkey Kong cartoon
i ahven't seen that in years
My OC is just Meh
Scoot-Scootaloo: Not all women can cook!
Oh god...how old is that anyway
Don
so much bill nye
don't do it!
HoodyNinja NO! Out of all of us, you should know never to do that unspoken act!
You should stream the buffer circle! \o/
00,03Shizu can ._.
Ugh.

I also prefer treat. But I should be prepared for trick.

I meant to ping that to DerpyWhooves
The film is pretty flawed, honestly. I can see why some would like it. I just can't appreciate it as a film because it's just....bad.

Lmao
worst portrayal of venom ever in this movie
He's a scientist, not a necromancer, Harry. Slightly different.
So theres a necromancer running around?

Dat necromancer

Better get a paladin or someone

Aw....
but that tenth chapter......god damn
what movie are we watching?
this movie failed because of Batman syndrome...too many villians
derpy_face Emo Parker
derpy_face: ARE YOU SERIOUS
you do knoe you guys and just easily type "flutt" and then it will go to flutterchu, the delete the C H and then press R and then TAB........it's not hard
SpadeMagnes[R]: o.O
No, it failed for several reasons.
derpy_face with Rifftrax
hey i just joined in..
>.>
I LOVE villians
im just here for breeead :3
The dual villain thing is honestly not the biggest flaw in the film.
derpy_face: Spiderman 3 "rifftrax"
Bread theif
Joker is the best villian
eveah
^^
^^^
also, hi derpy_face
The next spiderman movie needs the lizard
hi derpy_face :)
flutterr
oh ive seen this movie 4 times lol
if they had just one villian they could have written a way better story
but hello
SpadeMagnes[R]: Wish granted.
"Daddy was just breaking and entering, sweetheart."
dont tell me rifftrax did a titanic commentary?
SpadeMagnes[R]: It... has the lizard
instead of this disjointed piece of crap
superretroworld they did..
13superretroworld: was the first one i streamed
13at like 3 in the morning >>
flutterchu, that just makes me type flutterr o.o
funny thing is ima go because ive seen the movie 4 times and btw he dies in the end
bye everypony
heeh
and I still wasn't able to get through it
am i the only one-(no offense) who think's that Rifftrax isnt funny
Am I the only one who thinks this is the best Spiderman movie?
g'nigh derpy_face
how could they do that?
Bye derpy_face :)
05,15They also did a Matrix one which I hear is very funny
Just misunderstood
DerpyWhooves do you like it legit or for guilty pleasure?
13and the matrixes i streamed at the start of trilogy summer
>Nuke a facility
So how did the Sandman get his powers?
05,15I missed them ;___;
Canadian_Brony: Uh, legit?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Keep watching.
>"I did nothing wrong!"
Marlee Matlin wat cx
Shizuka: oh yeah i remember you saying that
SpadeMagnes[R]: DO YOU NOT WATCH THESE MOVIES
I only saw the first two
Oh that reminds me of a long boring story that will only make you feel guilty!
Never bothered to see the third
DerpyWhooves then you're in the hipster crowd.
HoodyNinja, I don't know how Sandman got his powers either :p
Aunt May isnt that old
Kurra keep watching
okay.
BUFFER!
lol
SpadeMagnes[R] not for me
He fell into a bunch of sand during some nuclear testing
It's funny because it's totally true. >_>
Ok... this is late.... Lyra` why did you paint me on SB's toe nails? >.>
the same way every other super powered person gets there powers. in the most bullshit way possible
and his dna mixed with the sand
...Aunt May has Zecora's Nightmare Night wig on
he sounds like gigabit
l
i miss uncle ben ;3;
my thing froze
SuperBrony has pony on his toenails?
Uncle Ben died right?
I wanna see a pic :)
yep DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins: eyup
God damn it stream stop buffering...I hate this computer
do they have kids?
uncle ben is on cold rice right now
Dat pointless guilt trip
So they never bothered to explain Peter's parents?
chat derp
Hrm.
Peter's parents are dead.
I know that
Would 4 60gb from OCZ in raid 0 be worth it?
is this thing on?
.... v.v
lol
I would in up paying 120 bucks for that
... Naaaah
Man, if only he had some kind of sense to detect incoming danger
Answered my own question
i remember the camera being worse then this
Dat surfboard
05,15Still not as bad as a Bourne camera
you didnt read the email i sent you?-i, skimmed it..
So is there any good reason Harry is doing this? besides blind rage?
Didn't you get the email explaining the situation? Harry's one of MJ's seven evil exes
I thought Spider-man made his own web shooters
SpadeMagnes[R] nnope
Bay cameras are the worst
DerpyMuffins not in this trilogy
SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Welp
This computer sucks~
Dat symbolism
DerpyMuffins: he makes them through chemistry afaik
for 120 though the load times in a 4 ssd raid 0 would be amazing.
Thats for sure
fo shizzle
05,15James Franco vision...it's probably very purple
Lol :D
05,15if you know what I'm saying
If I recall Harry didnt like his father that much didnt he?
I mean. compaters are cool herp der nerd stuff
Well it's a good thing no one is looking at Peter as he swings along AT GROUND LEVEL IN PLAIN VIEW OF EVERYONE
can you load an OS through striped raid?
for a sec, I thought I heard one of those cartoon "neeeeuuuuh" sounds . . . that was a bad onomatopoeia

FREAKAZOID~
HARRY! :[
these guys *are* just humans....
FREAKAZOID~
Ok who here would actually check a villian's body to see if they were actually dead up close?
Jaaaaaaason!
harry pumped himself up with joker venom and shit
I would, and prolly get killed.
Or would you shoot them to make sure
SpadeMagnes[R]: I wouldn't
I would shoot them
Just to make sure...
DerpyWhooves giant flies that live up in the Territories. They hibernate for over 11 1/2 months of the year. When they wake up, they start swarming and try to eat your flesh.

I swear if my chat broke again
"The guy we tied to the Ben Parker homicide"
CURSEES A FENCE
Yes, because Uncle Ben's death needed an extra retcon
Canadian_Brony: Well, then...
fuck it
he just climbed over a barbed fence lul
o.o
You know what this needs?
ooh
More sand
So let's get this straight
...a plasma converter?
WHY DONT THEY CHECK
SpadeMagnes[R] idiots
Anyone want to see the build I just made up and geek out about it with me? :3
duh
SpadeMagnes[R]: MORE sand? We're surrounded by sand!
Oh its just a bird, obviously nothing
HoodyNinja: You know just two cubic tons
what are they...
what?
THE WORLD'S GREATEST TOTHBRUSH!
They have this nuclear testing facility just outside of New York City
Guarded ONLY by a barbed wire fence
what is this thing?
CriticKitten: how is it nuclear
So how imcompitent are these scientists?
Kurra never explained what, exactly, they were originally doing.
And yet they believe that the facility is secure enough that "it's probably just a bird" in that sand pile.
SpadeMagnes[R] extremely
How annoying. o.ó
SpadeMagnes[R]: still not as bad as the chernobyl scientists
If you saw a disturbance in a experiment like this would you go check it?
yes
SpadeMagnes[R]: Do you have any idea how much two cubic tons of sand is?
Canadian_Brony, even though it isn't, I say it's a plasma converter.
This is hilarious.
I really hate this computer~
did you know that he now works like a swarm of bees there is one grian of sand that is basically the queen
twilight_sprinkle: The facility is nuclear powered IIRC. Or at the very least it's powered under questionable means. :P
And why exactly do they have a facility like that guarded by a sole chainlink fence?
Kurra again, we are never told what it is, so I just say "Fuck it. This is Spiderman 3."
. . .
*whine* ;;
Yes, this is happening. XD
CriticKitten: i dont remember nuclear power being mentioned, there are other power engines besides nuclear
So what the hell were they doing with the sand?
twilight_sprinkle: its easiest to jump too
SpadeMagnes[R] never explained.
i need to ask you guys to scootaloo
i'm guessing the sand was just for a base
SpadeMagnes[R]: Mass glass production
Actually, my bad, it's a fission reactor
ROCKS
But w/e. Experimental power, nuclear, whatever. :P
sand
sand actually
a fission reactor is basically a nuclear reactor
Lets not take them for granite
Robot Rocks?
CriticKitten: how do you know its a fission reactor though
HoodyNinja yes, because heat is too mainstream *pushes up Hipster glasses*
stream compression is officially DED
05,15Dr.Dune
05,15lol
Son of a beach.
owilolicios?
DED :[
They're using fission on the particle accelerator, IIRC.
dat obvious CGI
i dont remember anything about fission being mentioned
anmating sand has to be hell on earth to do
So basically he's Imhotep
dat Hoody not caring
Cats love him
Except not as cool
CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS
and he's all like "I'm sand. Cool."
Mr. Sandman
xD
05,15look at all that CG
ok how did the necklace servive?
now how did that not get fused to him or messed up
Bum bum bum bum
Awwww
this one scene took longer for the animators than the rest of the movie combined. true fact lookk it up in the xtras of the movie
doctor_whooves127: Tru dat
XD
if that was me, I think I'd just let my form go. forever.
Good point, why isn't he HORRIFIED at this?
sad scene
and just be sand, and scatter to the oceans.
If that was me, I'd panic.
Then panic some more.
Faint.
And then go back to panicking.
Canadian_Brony: XD
Canadian_Brony: Get a drink....panic some more
Did I mention I would panic?
SpadeMagnes[R] XD
Why does everyone complain about this movie?
HARSH
Just....ouch
DerpyWhooves: Keep watching.
Canadian_Brony: I'll have the chicken salad. THEY'LL DESTROY IT ALL!
13spider man, spider man, whines just like a teenage kid
This movie follows the Eva rule
CriticKitten: I own this on DVD.
HoodyNinja: DESTROY IT ALL
Shizuka hey, I don't whine :(

Shizuka: Just happened?

spoilers
how wasn't spiderman kaboinging gwen stacy in teh comics?
well i guess that answered me
05,15This is all true by the way
yep
05,15Spidey forgot how physics worked and killed Gwen
Your daughter / his girlfriend is about to fall to her death, and you're like "meh, shit happens"
Haha more ANGST
and the innocence of comics died with her or something
gwen stacy should have been in the first movie...and died
He's a cop... of course he's there
CriticKitten perfect parenting.
fluttercry *sigh* stupid physics.
05,15Yeah, that was a huge moment because the Hero never fails
Dick
I like Gwen from Amazing Spiderman better
^
Do you find it more able to get into a story if the hero fails every so often?
I haven't seen "The Amazing Spiderman" yet, is it good?
gwen should die in the next movie
05,15Best character in these movies
DerpyWhoovesYES
HAHA Daily Bugle
DerpyWhooves YES
05,15I love J.J.Jameson
Canadian_Brony: Better than the original?
fluttercry: but a hero with flaws is better than one without... usually
JJ is the only correctly cast character
05,15aka Cave Johnson
Everyone does
:D
(original movies)
DerpyWhooves by a long shot.
JJ is enjoyable.
GET TO THE POINT
00,03JJ is MLG~
He's good at this.
PILLZ HERE

BZZZZ
Dem pills
BZZT
05,15I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons GET MAD! I DON'T WANT YOU DAMN LEMONS WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THESE

GET OUT
05,15DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM? I'M THE GUY WHO'S GOING TO BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN! WITH LEMONS
Do you smell that smell!?
fluttercry: But I have a lemon fire proof house
:P
fluttercry when life gives you lemons, rub the lemons in Life's eyes, kick it in the nuts, and then watch ponies.
eddie brock was a reporter, not a photographer
fluttercry: I WILL MURDER YOUR FAMILY!
Tasteful nudes
05,15nobody else..played Portal 2?
i played P2
Stop talking now :D
I played part of it...
fluttercry: I did :(
DeadpoolDash: he was also friend of peters at some point
Octavia'd be good at that.
Eeyup fluttercry
depends on the story Spectrum_Rush
Suckup, I smell.
fluttercry: i was waiting for you to finish the whole quote
05,15I'M GOING TO GET MY ENGINEERS TO BUILD A COMBUSTIBLE LEMON
Oh goodness don't tell me JJJ can be suckered by kissing up... that sucks.
Why the fuck does JJ think spiderman is a bad guy?
it is JJ's role to hate spider-man
engineer is credit to team
SpadeMagnes[R]: Journalism
And then cameo
Oh hai stan lee
Ohi Stan Lee :)
Who the hell was that?
fluttercry unfortunately no. I have 2 Steam games. That says a lot about me.
Sorry, that cameo was too blunt.
ha
Ohey Stan Lee.
Because he doesn't give JJ a lap dance while making his paper the only one in town while lowering his blood pressure?
Is he in all his movies?
05,15That was Stan Lee HoodyNinja.
who?
fluttercry: Oh I like this guy
fluttercry: I know, but who is he playing?
05,15HoodyNinja just a guy
Dat Stand Lee
Burger
05,15I liked his cameo in The Avengers
Did I hear that right?
Managed to get this: http://imgur.com/U5F9M :D
damn, gtg
later
That one was good, yeah.
This one? Eh. Not as much fun.
Cya HoodyNinja
fluttercry: old guy in the park? right
05,15Yup
bye hood-
dah
I forget what was the purpse of what caused the creation of the Green Goblin?
05,15I actually need to go to the comic book store now that I have some money
SpadeMagnes: Nothing interesting. :P
05,15It's been a while
lolz at Mary Jane sucking at everything
ALL the papers
Poor mary jane
complete reversal of her in the comics
Ouch...
Just ouch
Yes, we're building up a jealousy thing in this movie. >_>
05,15lol
Spidilicious?
I swore I saw spidielicious
who the hell spends money on a parade for a masked vigilante?
05,15I did too
god he is such a dork, and not in the godd way
05,15Scott Pilgrim is best dork
^this
05,15Has Bruce Campbell had his cameo yet?
.....
Forgot about that bit of dumb.
Is Sandman stupid enough to not change his clothes?
hes a ninja
he may be best dork, but I am best nerd *pushes up glasses*
campbell is the doorman i think...or is it waiter in this one?
SpadeMagnes: He's made of sand, why not change his facial features entirely?
WHY WOULD YOU GO IN HERE
He's a bloody idiot.
Gee maybe I should investigate it
:o
sandy vag
IMHOTEP!
Never take this guy to a beach
SpadeMagnes[R]: i dont think he expected a giant sand monster
05,15NYPD is one of the most inaccurate police forces in the US
05,15The more you know
Remember, kids, giant piles of sand blow like clouds in the wind
How did she not die from the force of falling that far?
Even IF spidy caught her
fluttercry, inaccurate? As in shooting?
05,15yup
dear heavens.
I may have miss heard her but HOW far did she say she fell?
Funny, their bullets seem to racial profile though, no?
SpadeMagnes: In the comics, Spidey saved Gwen from a fall off a bridge, but her neck snapped.
60 ft i think?
fluttercry who is more inaccurate: NYPD or Stormtroopers?
HOW IS SHE NOT DEAD
05,15Read that bit of info after they shot a bunch of civilians by accident a few months ago
SpadeMagnes: This movie? Nope, just raw stupid. :D
SpadeMagnes[R]: because spiderman caught her
Being caught regardless she would have died from force of stopping
I heard about that shooting.
. . .
wow
Hello, we're watching Spiderman numbah three-ie?
SpadeMagnes[R]: not if she was slowed down into it
She'd have to withstand maybe 10Gs...
VenHur eeyup
twilight_sprinkle: She wasn't. :P
bad move spidey
oh you fool
SHit
oh boy
Dumbass~
O_O;;;;
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
Maybe he should have specified
NOOOOOOO
AWKWARD
CriticKitten: are you sure? thats usually how spiderman catches people, he moves in an arc along with them
And then engagement calld off
stupid stupid stupid
also this scene never made any sense to me
On the CHEEK, you... ffffs

Dat logic

Is it ever explained what his daughter's disease is?

So how long is it going to fucking take for the ooze at the start of the film to become relevent?

So whos more at fault here? Parker for not thinking or, MJ for not talking it over
SpadeMagnes[R] yes
Originally we thought it was this guy. It turns out the script writers wanted to retcon this for no reason
"He's at large stupid; on 2nd street"
ooooh Spiderman
Is this even a part of the comic continuity?
o time for peter to go kill some1 again
Ha, and the Rifftrax people agree with me. XD
the news is at the hubs facebook page big news tomarrow there is a pic
SpadeMagnes[R] not really.

These characters are such twats. It bugs me.

Bye, Scoot-Scootaloo. :P

Peter's Batman voice is plain laughable

If sandman got hit with water, that means he is moldable and can be made into a sandman castle
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo. Are you sure you want to miss Emo Parker?
NIght, Scoot--gone
good night Scoot-Scootaloo

13emo died fast after 2008 or so
holy damn, emotion?
13unless it just mutated into hipsters
/me doesn't rage about doors
I know even less about fashion...
Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Parker just showed emotion. Let's give him a hand.
/me slowly claps
13wooooo
now wasn't the landlord a complete asshat in the second movie?
Let's wait and see if he does any evil dances. Then we'll know he's Patel.
/me sarcastically claps
He showed emotion... MOVIE RUINED
13more emotion than keanu reeves so far
but emo never was hipster. I would think hipster has too much dignity....?
There is a BIG differance between a hipster and emo.:P
Woh.
ha
I don't rage about doors. I rage about the stupid doorways because I stub my damn toe on it.
IGTG D:
He knows kung fu.
EVRY

Night superretroworld :)
avenge me
Night superretroworld
Seriously, though, anyone know what King Somber ACTUALLY is?!
night superretroworld
oh my god dat "yeah:D"
King Somber?
thelonepony: Look him up
Why does Harry ignore the fact his father tried to kill him?
[OC]ShadowQuill, Ooiiiiiiiii. Don't talk about that here..
thelonepony: VERY IMPORTANT
its Sombra
yum
Osborn tried to kill Harry right? or did I forget something
brb gonna look for it :3
Sound card crashed?
...
So basically, that earlier retcon that made him lose his memory? YEP, TOTALLY POINTLESS
Chicken fried bacon? Yum.
:D
or the bacon fried chicken
:D
Anyone read/watched Know Your Mare?
SpadeMagnes[R]: father-son love? idk
As long as it has bacon, chicken, and it's fried
Did I miss the part where he's strutting around town all cocky and shit?
i'm back...
hai pete
ASoftFluffyThing: I dion't know
she is just too cute
*don't
[OC]ShadowQuill, okay
-lol
you mean the breakup bridge?
Not yet ASoftFluffyThing
[OC]ShadowQuill no, but I considered putting it on my "Read Later" list. And by "Read Later", I actually mean "Nag myself to read this every once in a while but never get around to it".
Incoming cliche: breakup on a bridge :D
Tobey Maguire: The only man who looks like he is happy whilst crying
turtles
OUCH
[OC]ShadowQuill IKR?
Canadian_Brony: BUT THOU MUST READ IT.
Gosh Peter you look 47 man, stop wearing a frikken helmet on your head.
LETS NOT TALK IT OVER
He failed the polygraph.
He has to protect the city you stupid bitch!
Dickovitch
HE HAS A JOB
?
Please, please don't say that. I can do better, I can act!
she should just off handadly mention the goblin
And the oscar goes tooooo
Dude! Show some emotion! She's doing better, and she is doing just about nothing!!
Mega_Milk, the trees in the background!
Whooooooooore~
ASoftFluffyThing: Exactly.
>it could be a chick
Mary Jane could have been less stupid.
So why did Mary Jane not talk this over?
shes protecting him
breakup point
that /might/ make the movie interesting
SpadeMagnes[R], being blackmailed (?)
but it's overly doubtful
So Harry is the fall back guy?
Or not try hinting she's being blackmailed?
fffffffff.
o.o
owch
DUMB BITCH
coff harry's evil coff
D:
And so begins his jealous rage to murder Harry
SpadeMagnes[R]: she genuinely wants to protect him
blunter than a baseball bat
lol...
xD
>Spaghetti falls out of Peter's pockets >His Face When http://derpy.me/L7Bw1
hmm
twilight_sprinkle: She could have sort of hinted she was being blackmailed to know she didnt mean it
i'm evil btw
everyone is evil in this movie...except Sandman who is just there
and then he's hitting on the waitress?
SpadeMagnes[R]: like i said, shes protecting him, she doesnt want him to get killed over her
so apparently there is "big news" coming from the Hub tommorow... but they wont tell us what it is
13oh great now we have a third villain, hollow man

Canadian_Brony: Well, other identity

Shizu: He's craaaaaaawling iiiiiiiin his skiiiiiiiin right now
Shizuka really? I missed it . . . oh Celestia he is ugly.

Shizuka: I ws thinking more like the nerds beiber bowl.
HOW DID HE GET ALL OF THIS UNDER HIS CLOTHES
When your blades aren't noisy enough

Peter the Pied Poontang Piper

I can't believe I came in on that scene
I feel dirty just THINKING about dancing.
goddamn, it never ends
did i just watch
p4ngya Emo Parker.
Nuff said.
/me catches the dredded disco fever
Solo flash mob
Fargo Largo
Hah! you thought he was dead
p4ngya, you watched....something.
I'm pretty sure that was Matthew Patel, not Peter Parker
Awful, awful CGI . . .
Hi BronyState btw
reborn by sewage
you know...
Me and my firebaaaaall~
Petrified_Discord, that what Peter wants you to think about him.
Hi AlienWarhead
everyone who ever lived has engaged in a solo flash mob, all their lives.
Yep.
Yeppers
He's doing exactly what you think he's doing.
Hi ASoftFluffyThing
so did harry have a step 2 to his revenge plan?
I was going to get a Derpy shirt today but the only sizes they had could only fit a tank :/
ok that was actually pretty smooth
Peter used Charm. It's...uh....effective to a point?
still a douche though
[Alpha]: I think you need to call Rarity
and then we have THIS
I declare that this can only end well!
And then....
Petrified_Discord get out.
Get out now.
ASoftFluffyThing: He used slip the desperat waitress a 5 its super effective.
dat singing
dayum hes good
Should I be scared Peter is now showing emotion effectively?
I would if I could :D
so when did he lrn to play the piano?
Petrified_Discord: I'm sure nothing will go wrong>_>
peter grade a jerk
play them off, spidey man~
SpadeMagnes[R] >Peter

>Effective emotion
wut

impossibru
twilight_sprinkle: Keyboard Cat promptly sued
That chair just hits someone in the face offscreen
it hurts, the showboating
Peter turned on his swah
SO MUCH SWAG
*swag
It's Matthew Patel.
See?
SWAG OVERLOAD
I told you that wasn't Parker.
someponys not getting payed tonight.
dat saxy
this is...hilarious
oh my god, the swag, its too much
SPY
If you waaaaaant to fight him~
You're not the briiiiightest~
by the way, in the real story spider-man proved on of brock's stories wrong by capturing the real criminal and then brock got fired and his wife left him, he then was going to commit suicide at the church, but the symbiote was there and shared the same hatred for spider-man as brock and they became Venom
no no its the wrong kind of swag
Peter used Attention-Seeking Douche. It's....
wow parker is a douche
So a unknown side effect of the symbiote is it can make you dance really well?
none can resist Spiderman's Spidermoves
This is not swag. This is . . . gawd, I have no idea what the hell this is.
hello everyone
DeadpoolDash TL;DR
SWAG
Canadian_Brony: A bad scene?
DeadpoolDash: Yeah, this story was WAAAAAAAY better.
he used you dumb girl
ouch
this is sewer swag.
^
swag is stupid
spideys a better villain than many others

hi oni_link|sick. How are you feeling? :P
Hey oni_link|sick
AlienWarhead worse than that
ASoftFluffyThing: I want to agree with you. But at the same time. The world delth him A LOT of crap. He deserves a little douch bag time.
Being genuine >>>>>>>> swag
Hi, oni_link|sick. :)
Mega_Milk, true

OH SHIT
PIMP SLAP

PETER SMASH

PETER CRUSH
Confusaterror

PETER RAGE
LOL
gawd, that face was HILARIOUS!!
SEE YOUR REGRET INCARNATE
oh fuck
Canadian_Brony: a bit under the weather lol a cold and and my ear is stuffed up
CriticKitten: I am using that from now on
confusaterror
OUR PROTAGONIST, EVERYPONY. Let's give it up!
Did you see his eyes? They were like O______O
and hi there ASoftFluffyThing and AJIsAwesome|Busy :)
NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
Spiderman, ladies and gentlemen.
Im that guy you just randomly crushed like 2 dasy ago!
oh dang i missed it
Hi oni_link|sick
So when did the symbiote make you dance like a boss?
LOL THIS IS HALARIOUS
/me casts Regen on oni_link|sick
How sick are you :(
symbolism
the Spidershank redemption
plus brock was a bit of a body builder as well, this enhanced his strength as venom since the symbiote multiplies the users strength by some various number
this is the only thing they got right
ANNNNNNNNNNNNGSSSSSSSSTTTT
I missed the worst scene in the movie :(
oni_link|sick ouch, I hope you feel better soon. it's better than throwing up, amiright?
hey thelonepony , enough to have missed work
Suicide
Well if it's church and then steeple, then the next step would be to look inside and...you know what, nevermind. :/
Squallken isn't that a good thing?
Oh, damn.
Where the fuck is Shocker
Canadian_Brony: yeah barfing would have been the worst :(
I want Shocker damn it
shocker isent in this movie
SpadeMagnes: Sir not appearing in this film
BUT HE IS IN THE GAME!
OH MY GOD THIS IS HALARIOUS
Kurra: It missed O,O
yeah but I wanted to hear what the riffies had to say
Damn man, well i hope you get better :(
SpadeMagnes[R]: He was in the movie based video games
And crying like a little bitch
god plz kill some1 amen!
so was the Vulture
A superppower
thelonepony: lol me too, especially since I have work tomorrow
lol
I was hoping for a movie version of the shocker scene
also Eddie Brock rarely if ever referred to himself as Junior
So why does the symbiote hate sound?
I hate how movies turn the already flimsy fake imagery of faith, make it religion, and then just cheapen it further -.-
SpadeMagnes[R] never explained.
still, even this movie cant make me hate spiderman
how do you feel right now oni_link|sick ?
Vibrations maybe?
SpadeMagnes[R]: space is silent
SpadeMagnes because, that's why
SpadeMagnes: Didn't we talk about this? Asking silly relevant questions.
Kurra IKR? Stupidly annoying
Uh, not fake imagery of faith-- I mean how they make faith look fake
I really liked the Amazing Spiderman, this series managed to ruin the Symbiotic Spider-Man and Venom for me :/
SpadeMagnes[R] Never explained in the movie, but in the comics it has to do with sonic vibrations.
Wow it's just....terrible :S
NO, BLACK MATERIAL! YOU MADE ME ACT FOR A CHANGE!
SpadeMagnes[R]: iirc from the tv series, the alien is just hurt by the frequency of that sound
thelonepony: not too bad, Ive been nomming cough drops like crazy
the whole weak to sound thing wasnt really ever explained even in the comics
Choclaye raaiiiiin
oh great, now I have Chocolate Rain in my head
Some stay dry
And others feel the pain
CHOCOLATE RAIN you guys CHOCOLATE RAIN :O
hey its the stuff from Prometheus
And then Venom happened.
GAH
Ohai SpadeMagnes[R] (wow im late)
AH
xD
we were EATEN
by VENOM
yes
Hi Marco :)
YES
AND SHOWER FOR NO REASON
clean yourself
hi Marco
SO MUCH CANTERLOCK
Hai thelonepony and Canadian_Brony :D
hoi Marco
And so, 1:44 into the movie and we have our title villain at last!
Crude oil symbology
hi Marco
hey twilight_sprinkle and AlienWarhead
So much hilights
lets see how much Venom refers to himself as "We"
CriticKitten IKR?
So why did it take almost 2 hours for the title villian to become relavent?
In the comics Venom also has issues with fire.
SpadeMagnes[R] Emo Parker
Because this movie is a failure on every level.
XD
it's ALWAYS Emo Parker
CriticKitten that too
i would of just bought a new door a long time ago....
CriticKitten: eeyup
Honestly, new door at Home Depot, literally like $40.
Canadian_Brony: lmao emo parker XD
naturesfury: He dosent need a door. Just new knobs.
Drill a deadbolt and install for like $20 more.
all the sybiotes have issues with fire and sonics
AlienWarhead: We do not mention One More Day.
EVER.
CriticKitten: Sorry, I couldn't help myself because I'm a fan of Linkara
Guitar Hero reference :D
Well, Ill brb
what's another day?
*
^^
Cya everypony
seeya DerpyMuffins
Bye DerpyMuffins :)
hi DerpyMuffins
dat pawnch
bye DerpyMuffins
Isnt Symbiote supposed to beefy?
also venom is kind of a freak in that most symbiots kill there hosts
Ohai AlienWarhead :3
AND WHERE IS THE EVIL VOICE
AJIsAwesome|Busy fight scene incoming! Also, Venom.
venom should always refer to himself as "WE"
SpadeMagnes[R]: depends on who the owner is
hi thelonepony
Hi!
Okay. Thanks, Canadian_Brony. :)
We ALL wanna kill the Spiderman!
np
HEY it's foreplay
Hi, XylemTube. :)
Venom's supposed to be beefy as heck.
Wasnt symbyote brock beeffy?
Hi XylemTube :)
*beefy
yes
its simple, we Kill the spiderman
hoi XylemTube
andOMG rifftrax! I loveshizu
And why doesnt he have the creepy voice?
brock was also beefy before the symbiote
Kurra Venom is buff because Brock is/was buff.
Kurra: Instead of beefy they went with beef jerky...y
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah I don't know why they changed that
ha
Ruined forever
They went with turkey jerky it looks like to me....
venom is buffer than brock by quite a bit
AJIsAwesome|Busy *annoying Hyperion respawn voice* Between you and us, that thing that killed you is a total dick. Please ignore this message if you commited suicide.
CriticKitten DEAR HEAVENS.
13quick, out of nowhere let's have a protracted action sequence
Kurra: It's a comic critically panned by everyone and hated by every fan of comics out there because of how fucking insulting it is.
am i the only one who thought Matrix Reloaded and Revelations is underrated?
CriticKitten I thought the real issue was the retcon of the marriage.
Wait
oh yes a kidnapping fixes EVERYTHING
Shizuka atleast it's a GOOD fight scene
How did this happen?
best part of the movie, anyway
Do they ever explain this?
No kidnapping scene?
the sand man quick was the hydroman
No nothing?
CriticKitten: HOLY FRUITY PEBBLES!
I keep expecting to hear Blige eerytime someone says Mary Jane
Wow.....she gets kidnapped A LOT. Youd think shed buy a gun or a tazer or some freakin mace by now!
AJIsAwesome|Busy there was. Venom grabbed Mary Jane's face after she got in a taxi. That's about it . . .
Sebiale: Yup. He trades his marriage for Aunt May's life, and the author admits he did that because he liked the original stories better, back when he was not married, thus retconning his entire development over decades.
Canadian_Brony: Ah. Okay.
AJIsAwesome You must have missed the very brief scene where Venom grabbed MJ in a taxi.
Mega_Milk: She's been diagnosed with Princess Peach syndrome
Which is why it pissed so many people off.
it's not very impressive
XaviortheSavior: I must've. Okay.
LOL SOME PIG!
when did this become charlotte's web
well everypony i have to go
bye bye
13suddenly he's gouda!
Bye Maid_RainBow :)
Bye, Maid_RainBow. :)

bye Maid_RainBow
seeya Maid_RainBow
13quick! find me the top secret public security team!
HOW IS HE NOT DEAD
get help from enemy over ironman or the fantastic four
Shizuka oh, I have them on speed-dial.
HE WAS IN THE CENTER OF A EXPLOSION
CriticKitten: >.> The problem with the major comic continuities has been the author's inability to really progress the characters and the stories. :S
1-800-FUCK-YOU
In this segment the Buddha doesn't deserve his help
Because he's magic. :D
authors'*
....and now this fucking guy
And the butler decides to stop being an idiot
almost Alfred
and your just now telling him this?
Why the hell didn't say that earlier, you're fired
YOU ARE FIRED
Alfred ripoff?
13and then for no particular reason the butler picks NOW to tell him
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8127/ this whole entire universe of Spiderman.
ha ha burnerd is kind of a dick waited 2 years to tell him this
WHY DIDHE NOT EXPLAIN THIS WAY EALIER
Worst. Alfred. EVER.
Because he's a fucking idiot
:D
13you should have told him that TWO MOVIES AGO
CriticKitten: Can I flip a table?
Kurra: thats me right now
Shizuka you're late to saying that.
who has seen two best sisters play resident evil 4 x3
But you added stuff too
this is he only good part.
Please do. Shit like this is why the film is so terrible.
/me flips a table in rage how stupid this movie is
/me hands SpadeMagnes[R] a table
Would have been better if he had just figured it out himself.
I has [Alpha]
butler is best hero.
burnerd keeper of the polt
[Alpha] Probably 2-3 times
/me unflips the table SpadeMagnes[R] flipped and flips it himself.
I love how she should be dead
When a man who you have only treated professionally at best, comes out and says HE LOVES YOU, calmly, that BUCKING MEANS SOMETHING, so you should pay attention.
but isn't
I watched it over and over. Doesn't get old
Well gee I guess those webs that are as strong as steel can't hold up a single taxi cab
Dat flag

MJ should be dead! I don't care that she didn't hit the ground, the abrupt change in velocity after falling that far should have done serious damage.
:D
Carage
lol Red Suit Venom
It's a trap!
It's a tarp!
Stop removing your mask!
his teeth...
It's a part!
My god. Eddie.
Carnage :P
OH MAI
Petrified_Discord: Y we talking about Carnage?
You have no reason to keep taking your damn mask off!
Admiral CriticKitten, knows when shit is a trap
dat lack of emotion
IfyouknowwhatImean.jpg
So Shizuka, do you prefer any of the three movies, or The Amzing Spiderman movie better?
*amazing Spiderman
13haven't seen the new reboot
13of these three the first is best
Sebiale: Carnage always made me think of Deadpool + symbiote
I NEED TO SEE THAT REBOOT
^
Amazing Spiderman is pretty crap too.
at least the new spider-man has web shooters
Shizuka give it a watch
Shizuka WATCH IT. The Amazing Spider man is GOOD.
Of all these movies, Star Trek IV is the best.
13i haven't heard anything good about the new one .-.
But it's better than this one.
Ah.
13it was only made so they don't lose the license
Not saying much.
Okay.
But it is better than this one.
just saying hes hould be dead
Shizuka: Haven't seen it either, But I think I heard it's good.
Petrified_Discord: Oh sweet Celestia. That would be horrifying.
NewSuperBronyU: moo
the lizard was done wrong
Plot conveinience?
Shizuka here's a good thing about it: the love interest isn't a damsel in distress.
That was a lot of green screen
should be ded
13yeah but it's a comic book
Oh look he landed in SAAAAAND
and then he broke every bone in his body
Shizuka: imo its better than 2 and 3 of this and hell i liked it better than the first one also
i thought venom wasnt a villan (people at school told me) :'(
13you can't have deep characters
venom's character traits change over the years
oh look, CG
Boss battle!
:D
Well gee, it's a good thing those webs are strong enough to hold steel....oh wait never mind, this film keeps forgetting that factoid
Fight!
Sebiale: Oh god...symbiote Deadpool ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
the current venom is Flash Thompson
wat.
You got eyes in my sand!
Petrified_Discord: Like in a what-if, or part of the old main continuity?
You got sand in my potato salad!
Eddie Brock is Anti-Venom
Symbiote Deadpool is so ridiculous, I bet he's just a librarian or something
Were any of the Venoms "good" in any sense?
and dead
dead
13oh look, a new thing to fall on her
For god's sake, we get it, writer. You like the Mummy. A lot.
Was that supposed to be a laugh?
Deadpool, the normal universe one, is FREAKING. AWESOME.
DEAD
Sebiale: So I have no idea what this is from, but yeah: http://derpy.me/uCGCH
HE DIED DAMMIT!!!
Spiderman needs a sword or something
....derp eyes?
We need more fourth wall breaking super heroes like him...
ded
Shizuka: I honestly like the re boot, this trilogy on the other hand... I also think they did it to eventually include him in the Avengers, they still need Wolverine as well >.>
deaf
TOOK LONG ENOUGH
Petrified_Discord: simple deadpool being taken over by the carnage symbiote
Hey its Clayface! Oh wait no
gnarly!
Timing!
Spectrum_Rush: You know, the usual :P
The kid gives more emotion in that one line than Peter in the entire series!
^
^^
He came.
^^^^
LOL
TEAMWORK
XD
Power Glove joke? XD
It's so bad.
2v2 Fightf!
Canadian_Brony: literally
That is exactly how jets work
YEAH
oni_link|AFK well duh, I've used it before.
Mini-crits all around!
:D
Damn kid
Dat acting
that kid is a freaking genius
LOL
:D
Canadian_Brony: lol
That kid. BOSS MOTHERFUCKER.
Kid knows how to get bank
I give the writer credit, that kid was a baws
That Kid.
LIKE A BAWSS
Kid knows to to loan shark.
yaaaay I mean, oh no
Like a motherbukken' CEO
And he comes the screaming.........AGAIN.
XD
MJ, do you have any purpose beyond falling and screaming?
ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
Just....ya know, asking.
And she didnt die...
and their necks snapped
NewSuperBronyU: sleepies
FUCK PHYSICS
AGAIN 50Gs of acceleration.
Who does he think he is defying physics like that, Pinkie Pie??
So...what happened to Venom?
SpadeMagnes[R]: No kidding.
only 60's Spiderman does what he wants
13MJ..
13buy a gun..
Megalomanic: he took a smoke break, hes not needed on the set yet
Shizuka but that would require her to think.
good thing about the reboot movie: gwen stacy actually knows how to defend herself
Hey MJ, how about you oh I don't know, FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE?!
So why does this area have so much sand?
MJ.... move to freaking St. Kitts and Nevis. Retire. You deserve it.
Canadian_Brony: that too
XaviortheSavior EXACTLY!!!!
xD
lol
facelift
I can't help but laugh at Peter's torn mask :D
bonk
3-hit combo
that was timed so perfectly
I havent been following the Spider-Man comic universe, how did Peter die??
Give NewSuperBronyU hugs
STOP THAT
It looka like a terrible fashion trend. :D
Stop taking your mask off for no goddamn reason
AJIsAwesome|Busy there are a lot of terrible fashion trends
Eddie's stupid face <<<<<<<<< Venom's face
Amnesia XD
oni_link|sick: I think he only stayed dead in the ultimate universe
So does Venom's species have a name?
Do they actually make these jokes as they watch the movie? Or do they just edit all of this in?
well, he just broke every bone in his body
AlienWarhead: Oh well theres a new one isnt there?
or atleast his neck
FATALITY
13Sebiale: they do some preparation, otherwise they're recording while they watch
Well hey, we didn't need that extra main character anyways, right?
Okay, that part is meaningful.
and then Harry died
NEXT
oni_link|sick: Yeah, but I don't know much about it
YOU HAVE WEB SHOOTERS
>_>
Noooo! New Gobliiiin!
Oh well, I got over it.
BY THE POWER OF HAGGAR!!

VenHur: ^

It was heavily implies
Yep, Venom killed with ONE grenade
He threw a Samus Aran bomb at it
*implied
Beef Blastbody
CriticKitten: Were it so easy
Spiderman's arch nemesis, killed with ONE GRENADE
SpadeMagnes[R]: Rip Fizzlebeef
I love using that quote
He didn't ask for this
venom is one of the most resilent characters in the marvel universe
>mangles metal rods
suddenly the sun comes up agian?
Dude has 2 punctured lungs and a likely pierced artery.
>concrete is unaffected
CriticKitten: and in one section of a single movie
13i thought goblin was his arch enemy
He's like Ridley
He gets better
Shizuka: it varies through the ages
Hello :)

Hi, EctologistPony. :)

/me 's Favorite villian is Sandman
13this movie thought retcons were so nice it does it twice!
13to the same scene!
DANG AD!!!!!!!!!
lol
Shizu: Goblin's one of his best known villains, but Venom is generally considered his "official" nemesis because he was basically formed out by Peter himself.
YOU IDIOT

The earth's axis is on a wobble. That's why the North Star changes. One whole "rotation" is called a Celestial Year. Currently, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted in a way that gives us more extreme Summers and Winters, and the Southern Hemisphere will have milder Summers and Winters.

AJIsAwesome of course... if I didnt like her why would I draw her so much?
So what IS Taokaka's origin?
Platimun Has The Magical Girl Thing, Sure, But Her Attitude In The Story Doesnt Suit It. While Still Being Cute, She Loses Points For Not Fitting Her Appearance... *Nod Nod*
Panda: Oh. :D

11,02Panda: Sure o.o
Ugh, I haven't been able to comment on EQD for weeks. Doesn't matter which form I try to use. As soon as the page is refreshed, it disappears, and apparently no one besides Sethisto himself knows anything about the stuff. And he's unreachable.
I love the woodwinds in this song.
SB, what does berrypunch do?
11,02Panda: Kills all humans.
O_O
11,02Also, she drinks :3

Remind me never to get her mad.

Is BerryPunch, Phase4's fav pony or something?
Apparently, EQD assumes that EVERYONE uses Twitter, Facebook, and the like. I don't... don't trust them much.
XD
hory sheet SB
/me pokes BerryPunch
Panda, nah, just felt like calling the bot BerryPunch
Phase4 well she derps like shes drunk, shes slowly becoming her name~
XD
That's a lullaby? :D
Panda, completely unintentional i assure you
Well, Phase4 , there's that and there's all the rockets you build that fly like a drunk is at the controls.
Kencolt, true
AJIsAwesome: its from that level with the giant lady doing her levels

In fact, seeining some of those designs-- I'd need a couple-seven belts to get behind the wheel.
Kencolt: Not even those--IntenseDebate, Wordpress, OpenID, all of those fail as well.
And by a couple -seven I mean two sets of seven. Doubles.

Phase4: there was no encoding error the last 2 times oddly
SB XD

Phase4 which matches and replaces the string that comes before it?

i have a math test tomorro btw >.>
One of my college classes has nothing BUT TESTS for grades. :(
i actually got over 2 tim es the average on the last math midterm
buuut
08,01i don't think i've ever gotten a C in my life
Lucky. :(
everyone did so bad, their midterm grade wil be overwritten in the final
so basically i couldvt not even shown up and gotten a good grade anyway
i've never gotten a c because australia doesnt grade like that
yah. just percents
or good, very good, excellent, or UG
Phase4, my school sometimes does that letter grading system :<
08,01do any of you have ADD/ADHD? if so, i want to talk to you in PM
i got some c's during high school, but it was pretty ridicullous
I have ADD.
WHy do you ask?
mine too but not when i started
/me got all F's in highschool....
teachers were biased as hell
the teachers in my high school actually gave us lower grades so that we couldnt do worse on the final tests and make it seem as though they were giving us too high grades
I never went to high school. Truly. I actually lived in the freaking woods for a while (this WAS the 70's) and then too a GED to get into college.
so instead they always gave us lower grades so they could say "oh well hedidnt study, but he studied for final"
Kencolt O_O how old are you
55 come november, Panda .
Kencolt omg :D I shall ask you for advice then!
08,01Panda: you're a psychologist?
And from everything I ever heard about high school politics, culture, and whatnot, I'm happy I was in the woods.

int chat
chat is a variable of type integer
Wouldn't it be intChat then?
11,02NO
there has to be a separation
oh wait, different programming languages~
11,02It would be 'int chat;'
int chat = Alelgr0?
allegr0*
intchat would just be a variable
;
int chat (Allegr0);
declaration of Allegr0 :3
in which lang, twilight_sprinkle ?
Allegr0: c++
ah, that one I don't know yet :P
heh, i only know matlab besides that
and i wouldnt really say i know c++, still learning
back in high school i used to program in turbo pascal :D
daaaaww
and waaay back in the day, i when i was like 6, i messed around in python

hi ShyBetaFemale
you guys know what time i came home last night? i was drunk til i passed out at 7 am
i wake up 3 hours later
Phase4: idk how much programming ill have to take, my major isnt very related to it actually
and i might still be a little drunk
fuck. my. life.
Phase4: ill probably need matlab more than c++
twilight_sprinkle, that can happen, whats your major?
twilight_sprinkle: I've flirted with getting to France. born in germany and been to the UK and Denmark...so I'm getting close ;)
ShyBetaFemale: was it worth it? did ya party hard lol
Phase4: physics/engineering
lol
yeah we partied hard
Phase4: specialization however will be electrical and computer engineering
we have to do it again tonight
i'm in electronic engineering so its more aplicable to me
ShyBetaFemale: the only way to party!
lol they said doo doo
ShyBetaFemale: thats a good idea :D
twilight_sprinkle, ah
Allegr0: wow, youve been around a lot, thats cool. some didnt like it in france, i thought it was cool though
i'm running off 3 hours of sleep
and i feel horrible hahaha
still, Allegr0 , you know how they say the french drink a lot?
ShBetaFemale That's dangerous.
Allegr0: because boy is it true
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, my friend went there in high school and she had fun...and wasn't aware. Good to know though :P
twilight_sprinkle: also, the Japanese are the best to drink with...damn

twilight_sprinkle: especially when sake's involved
what's dangerous
i cast flare!

DAMMIT Phase4
Dat rainbow factory
:3
can you play the steampunk version Phase4? :D I'm playing Guns of Icarus at the moment :P
AdamTheDuck, after this one
sweet, this doesnt have lyrics. I hate the lyrics to this song
^ Vocals seem out of place yes, but the lyrics aren't that bad.
yeah whoever sings it sounds horrible
First one Phase4 :P
DeadpoolDash, the lyrics aren't too bad
it is just so grating to listen to
it ruins the the decent music that is in the background
"The filename does not have to exist in the local filesystem." Wat
is stream lagging?
Stream just stopped
Damn

in terms of menu and all
its getting there
tf2 y u update
TF2: Because WE LOVE YOU!!!!
D:
Punish quitters?
dat news
Evening all
AdamTheDuck, read the update
ohai Tiberium126
soo much invite
ohai shana
shana, you know much about apache?
hey Phase4, depends in which area :)
dat slow loading tf2
shana, php-fpm + apache 2.2
hmm no particular php-fpm experience, I only use fastcgi php
lolz Saxton Hale is coming for all the quitters, cowards and wheyfaced weaklings in Mann vs. Machine
but they may be similar
Hello Tiberium126
"Invalid command 'Action', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
"
Hai everypony
that's the apache error message?
yeah
did you use 'Action' in the config file?
G'day DerpyMuffins
shana, yeah, tbh its copy pasted from the internet
Hello DerpyMuffins
Phase4: did you load the fcgi modules?
i'm fairly sure its loaded
actually how does the action line look?
Ok, I just read it Phase4, but how doe sit punish leavers? It just says in what circumstances one gets punished.
does it*
shana, http://pixelgrade.com/web-server-administration/turn-apache-into-a-super-fast-webserver-with-mod_fastcgi-and-php-fpm/ same as this
copied from alias to action
AdamTheDuck, reduces queue priority
Nope Phase stream DerpyMuffins
DerpyMuffins, phase waits for tf2 to load stream
tf2 can take forever nowadays to load up
"but how doe sit punish leavers? It just says in what circumstances one gets punished." Oh I missed that
lolwut
why didn't it copy?
"Said punishment means being placed in low-priority matchmaking pools, making it longer to get into a game."
There
Phase4: you need mod_actions for that, imho
Phase4: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_actions.html make sure you have that one loaded
these games will be slow
ah
shana, that looks like the problem
http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-08-27-433-WordPuzzle.jpg
Phase4: btw why are you using apache in the first place :)
I wonder if any mann vs. machine mods have been made with the machine ponies
shana, verry bad hack for caching
Phase4: nginx has nice fastcgi support... (takes a while to convert apaches htaccess sometimes..)
and with that i big everypony a good morning...or night depending on your time zone/ whatever
bid*
shana, i'm proxying through nginx, thing is i need .htaccess suport
Goodbye taoumi
/me is stuck on downloading yourface2.mp3 .-.
Phase4: most htaccess files are rather simple and you can do stuff like rewrite inside nginx
shana, i meen i explicitly need .htaccess files
i've got some php
derp
Phase4: you have php generating htaccess files?
shana, i've got some php code that needs to generate them
http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-09-28-441-Tails.jpg
shana, i'll give you read access on bitbucket
sounds like a caching hack :D
shana, its a hack
a dirty filthy hack
but it works
Ooooh nooooo a haaaack
how uncooth
shana, whats your username?
nvm, found it
shana, http://pastebin.com/P6mLUwUw example htaccess file
trixie pyro
lol
i'm dying fast
not sure why
Lyra PAWNCH
need less friendlys
they add health to hale but do nothing
so you're serving from cache util it expires - in which case you redirect to index.php :D
vs cmc? awesome
(well its a rewrite)
heh
Yaaaay Phase4 is a chicken :D
shana, indeed
hello ever- :o tf2!
molestia!?!
shana, i'm going to have to change that in the future
different entry points and whatnot
adasdad: and Kinky Pie :D
love the ascii art :D (I know its not really ascii..)
dat Brodyquest
lol
dat fitting name
dat snipah
dem dats
Kinkeh Pie is best Pinkie Pie
shana, :3
what server is this?
do you invalidate caches when new posts are made and such?
Snow, 208.167.245.210:27015
shana, not yet, thats in plugin.php
i'm looking through for the best way to do that
that goomba scared the shit out of me
I think there are some plugins that do that
shana, i can catch 90% from actions in post.php
i.e. generate a static html on every post change (instead of on-demand)
Oh
shana, i've looked at that but its probably not worth the effort
a full site generation of bronystate takes a while
yes you can explode twice, if you have a cluster grenade that is
Yaaay, go Phase4! :D
still downloading bosses.
so much wub
Snow: how big are all these downloads? O_o
idk
points expunged fro not giving vinyl a bass cannon attack
but it needs to download meshes and stuff
MadSurge, Massive
theres a lot to download
208.167.245.210
need players
Phase4: Dang, I wish I had more space and a better computer :(
im just past applejack, and that was the first thing to download
MadSurge, :(
Alright, enough TF2 for me :P
night AdamTheDuck
well that is enough GW2 for me tonight
11,02Looks like there's a big announcement coming today related to My Little Pony :D

NewSuperBronyU, indeed. ANd we're due for the S3 premier date
dem props
desu
Any idea how long till the announcment and how it will be announced
Tomorrow is the announcement
11,02Taking a shot in the dark, but I'm guessing the premiere will either be this year on November 17th or Next Year January 12.
it will probably be sometime in the afternoon on the 18th for the announcement
I doubt it's gonna be next year.
My reaction when they'll announce the season 3 premiere date. http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/184/
this is not so fun
Really CrimsonPhoenix, mine would be more like http://derpy.me/vWjrv
/me Throws himself into the chat
/me licks Ponies47 :3
too overexcited for my taste
/me rubs Ponies47's belleh
omg still downloading o.o
08,01uh phase
08,01you realise you're streaming what you're doing at the momemnt
the crap
distracted by star trek
theres a good episode of next gen on tv here
08,01stream it! \o/
Phase4: Which episode? =D
Gold_Demona, data is in a primitive village, lost most of his memory, vilagers are blaming him for an illness
also wood contains rock
Phase4: Ooh, I love that episode!
acording to the vilagers
damn, those fallout always waking me up:|
Gold_Demona, no spoils :<
*pieces
Phase4: kk :.
:>
jingle jangle!
http://derpy.me/LBRXY
I love any episode that centers around Data. Unless it's one where he gets a love interest... Those are just weird. >.>
XD
that was a wierd one
Phase4 There was more than one
i've seen on
one'
DeadpoolDash, I don't think that's safe
is it safe?
08,01Phase4: why not use mod_php?
08,01ah
plus i want php running as a different user
why not zoidberg?
Yeah, that's a good episode.
DeadpoolDash, I'm just saying, those things are obscurring the rear view of the car
So original
Dat Skype
that is a tiny area in a truck rear window, especially if you are tall
i've no idea why this is doing this
my brains kinda fading in and out
didnt get much sleep and its late
What be this sleep you speak of Phase4?
sleep? whats that?
Sleep is when a mommy and daddy love each other...

11,02Night all :)
good night
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
Cya NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
/me waits installing Windows XP Home Edition on VMWare Workstation
Night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
Moo :3
OH
i know whats wrong
:o
Dat Phase4 brain blast
huh
halfway through the download btw
strange
thats not the problem....
Windows XP
Y INSTALL SLOW
dat xp
xp should be installed in half an hour at least
i know this because i had to instal it 3 times for school
<3 Streets of New Reno
I don't want to upgrade .-.
Downgrade
I've had to install XP several times cuz I was a computer killer as a teenager. :P
I mean
that IS the problem
why is php-fpm broke
Kill yourself lol
i swear I own Steam games i can't play because I have XP
the internets breaks so you has buy moar internets
I avoided upgrading until my computer died. Windows 7 isn't bad though. Depending on the version you get, it's about as stable as XP.
i have windows 7 ultimate edition, and its really good
Windows 7 Starter Version is obviously the worst
I have XP and i dont give a fuck lol
if you have xp its about time to switch to 7
Well I'm happy to upgrade to 7 but I'm figuring It's better if I do a full upgrade
better yet, ubuntu
You can't even custom change the wallpaper, from what I heard
I have the right in the middle Windows 7. I like it
...which needs money
before you upgrade, i reccomend to check if your hardware is compatible with 7
XP with SP2 , who the fuck need a good computer ?
08,01>.>
08,01<.<
/me 08,01totally isn't going to run nessus on ariscop.net
pony_1974: I do. I like playing graphics-intensive games
XD
lol
default wordpress install with broken php
like borderlands 2 i guess Gold_demona?
Never played Borderlands
Borderlands is graphic intensive?
yeah
Games like Mass Effect 3.
First World Problem: I'm bad at Touhou but still addicted to it anyway.
05specially if you sue the boarderlands physic engine thingy
Arthur, king of the Brittans
05for water etc
/me Glomps Wrek
/me gets the coconuts out
05now thats intensive on your machine
EA Sports physics
COP CLO CLOP CLOP
heh
Oh lawd
ANY game that has water effects
not sure what to research
research ALL THE THINGS! :O
Phase4, research everything for science!~
Lol ninja'd by Gold_Demona
Wrek, whats more important, plasma tech or battle ships?
lolled, checking my download and it said: downloading uber-cupcake.
Research your mother LOL
i'm one level of hyper drive away from battle ship
08,01-j8 is best flag
Phase4 how about going ddown the dark path of exploding star?
08,01ooo! i have an idea
/me 08,01logs into the compute server and does make -j64
XD
08,01wow
05Phase4:there is no point in investign in an army if you cant support it
i has bug
08,01okay, my compile is running real fast now
Wrek, fair enough
05when your income supports 1 battleship an hour
08,01Phase4: i know a lot about apache
05and you can mass them up for defence
05you can expand your planet
Kill your father then kill your sister lol
My computer sucks.
08,01magic?
Wrek, so you're saying dont bother untill i'm getting 45K metal per hour?
Magnets
I'm out of tea... Must make more!
It can't even run a PSP game fast.
magic *snort**snort*
Why
08,01Phase4: normally just apt-get install php-fpm
08,01hm
08,01are you using nginx?
thats where my music went
08,01what does your error.log say?
08,01aye
08,01okay, so it's probably just that you don't have the handler set up right
08,01pastebin me your httpd.conf
its the debian httpd.conf so theres a bunch of /*.conf includes
08,01Phase4: i think you have a .htaccess rule overriding it
08,01that'd be my first guess
no .htaccess file
08,01hmm
well, there is one but its blank
08,01every page on your server shows as the default for me
08,01no 404s or anything
you going to ariscop.net or www.ariscop.net
cause ariscop.net is just the default site right now
08,01ah, okay
What song is this Phase4?
AdamTheDuck, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1GJMJbZybQ&feature=autoplay&list=PLEE875E4C0AB1380C&playnext=6
Ahh, Ultra-luxe theme
08,01Phase4: where did you put your index.php?
in the document root
08,01oh wait
08,01no, that's not it
ok, its definantly not invoking php
/me <3 strace
08,01i was about to suggest strace \o/
08,01are you sure php5.fcgi is in /usr/local/www?
08,01just seems odd you'd put it there, rather than /usr/www
why is it looking for index.pl
08,01ah
the site said it didnt need to exist
it is indeed checking that folder for index.php
[pid 1395] stat("/usr/local/www/fastcgi/php5.fcgi/index.php", 0x7fff7bf28f00) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
08,01aye, you need to change that to be the same as your docu root
08,01i think
08,01either that or it's just ignoring your handler for some reason
i think its just ignoring the handler
i don't see why apache would check for that file before telling php
or maybe it is, who knows
08,01okay, try changing your fcgi aliases to your docu root
/me Looks at clock
08,01and put your index in php5.fcgi/index.php
/me sighs "Gotta go" :<
Bye guys
Thanks for the stream Phase4
Bye Ponies47
08,01i think it'll still read from the request path, and uses what it finds to pass to the fcgi server
later Ponies47
08,01or at least as an argument
05servers should either be up in 10 minutes
suddenly it works
05or an hour and 10 minutes :P
And now off to school blasting Tombstones music in mah ears :P
08,01woo \o/
08,01my work here is done; now to go and type up a report
XD
have fun
08,01and you!
/me GTFO's
suddenly nginx with 404 not found
Hmm, I just brought up the Planetside 2 launcher and there's a second window.
Oh God :D
/me has memories of sabotaging the ghoul rockets
dat Flight of the Valkyries
08,01# when you've bungled all your bangles, and your loved ones have been mangled, listen to the jingle jangle of my gypsy tamborine #
/me instantly grabs ipod
Hey Everypony! :)
Hiyo DerpDash
Hello DerpDash
08,01Phase4: are you behind a fancy firewall?
08,01hmm, you have a lot of ports filtered
it might be actually
openvz vps
08,01ah, okay
afaik i'm not behind a firewall though
08,01some interesting things going on with port 53 too
yeah, theres a dns server running for some reason
was in the default install, havent bothered to remove
08,01hehe, port 31337 filtered

Hey everyone :)
Hey RainbowPie

:<
Why lick when you can hug?
/me lick AdamTheDuck
licking is move fun
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/big-news-tomorrow-teased.html I wonder what this is:3
Most likely some toy announcement
RainbowPie, the annoucement of an announcement has been announced
I wouldnt mind a Nightmare Moon Plushie
AdamTheDuck: Indeed
There so expensive :(
I wish i had the money to buy a plushie
and the annoucement is of the cancellation of Season 3
/me sits on Gold_Demona
Jmo! D:
They cost somewhere between 20-200 US dollars
AdamTheDuck: Dont say that o.o
What is Phase4 trying to do?
DerpyMuffins: Its around $350+ for a good looking one?
DerpyMuffins, setup a thing
Alright. Fasting mode is go
yay
dat booing
AdamTheDuck, baselessly joking about Season 3 being cancelled, that's not funny.
im the engie btw
:<
Besides. If they were planning on doing something tragic like that, they wouldn't be building up fanfare of the event.
/me just realised he forgot to put in a :$ at the end of the joke to point out he wasn't being seriouos
Well back to reading how mil dots work~

Mega_Milk: I dont have the metal/keys atm :D gotta wait until Crate 40 stops dropping :P
that evil brew is a bitch's brew
RaveBrony: Well i'll hold it for ya until then ^-^
Mega_Milk: You dont have to :D I want to see how much i get for the crate first :P
RaveBrony: Arent the crates in a cycle?
Hmm?
i caught the sleepy
D:
RaveBrony: Like 40's will drop again next year around.
Phase4: Night phase.
Crush 40 anyone?
Good night Phase4
Mega_Milk: No, once Crate 50 starts dropping. You cant get 40 again :D
/me feels sleepy
Mega_Milk: The crate i have, 40, is worth about 13 keys atm :P
Im hoping it goes up to 16+ when it stops dropping :D
oh yeah?
RaveBrony: So its just gonna escelate untill either tf2 dies out?
i have a genuine lone star
only 50 of those in the world!
Lyra`: Ive got two unusuals :P
so?
i have 15 unusuals
Lyra`: 1% chance of ever seeing one.
my inventory is almost full
Lyra`: Damn 0.0
Mega_Milk: Pretty much, # 30 crate is worth buds now.
i am awesome
huh
almost all my weapons are unusual
Lyra`: You madame are lucky
I guess a fake Phase4 is now on
Lyra`: I must have you.......
and i dont use crates babe
amirite?
I dont like unusuals..... theres no "Blue" effect....
:(
RaveBrony: Yeah I know that.
/me stretches
hell, i dont even trade for them, they just show up after games
I fund em in crates randomly.
find*
also, being a female gamer, people give me awesome shit for free :3
XD
Bye guys :)
nice.
sonicdude558: Later.
you should consider being a female gamer
Ehhh.....
I want to buy all that i can with my crate. and then start gambling on crafting and openning boxes :D
nah i like my gender too much.
i mean, yeah you get dick pics from every fifth guy
but you learn to ignore them
._e
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh......no.
and guys constantly asking to see your ass
My backpack is almost full again. Im gonna have to get an expander soon.
'sup guys?
rrawr!~!
Eli: Sup.
Lyra`: You madame are a card.
Yeah, i feel bad when women are harassed on the servers :I
not much Mega_Milk. wouldn't be here if anything were up :P
Eli: Why's that?
RaveBrony: I've yet to come across a server were the admins arent heavily doctoring everything -lol
Mega_Milk: well, my friends are all in school. as much as i enjoy Bstate, i still prefer to keep my feet on the ground and in RL
Ah :P
RaveBrony, i was on a server once, and there was a guy arguing somewhere along the lines of "I'm a good boyfriedn because i buy my girlfriend tf2 items:
and he was arguing with a girl about how girls interpret that
Phase4: Ha
Phase4: that's sad
LOL
hi
That is so pathetic :D
Phase4: except if that girl was a hardcore gamer, that's just so unromantic...
morning, everypony
what happened
Hey puffmuffins
Eli, if the girl was a hardcore gamer i doubt she'd need tf2 items from the store
yo Sylandest
Hiya Sylandest :)
RaveBrony: The worst I came across was a gay couple and they werent arguing but the one that im fairky certain in the conversation kept saying how large his boyfriend is and how he calls him "Coke can"
Sylandest: Sup.
howdy Eli., RaveBrony, Mega_Milk :)
Phase4: yeah, but then the gesture would be sweet
/me sniffs
I have teh sniffles
Mega_Milk: Oh....lord o_e
RaveBrony: Yeah....fun stuff on that there tf2..
:D
Eli, his argument was actually 'i buy things for her cause thats what good boyfriends do' and that tf2 items are inconsequentially expencive
and what did I stumble into exactly?
but that was the only example he had
and he was a bit pushy with it
Phase4: Is it possible to find unusuals just by drops?
Phase4: Wow....
Mega_Milk, afaik no
No
hmmmm.......
Unusuals are unboxing only :D
Phase4: i think if you give your girlfriend game items, the relationsship isn't gonna last long. games usually don't last long
Thats why i want to gamble soon! /)^3^(\
Lyra` Claims to have never touched a box and have like 15 of them.....
morning folks
Dken2021: Sup.
RaveBrony: you play TF2?
morning, Dken2021
Oh yeah! Lyra`, what unusuals do you have?? :o
Eli: Yes, indeed :)
im back
RaveBrony: well add me :P
Steam name? :o
welcome returns puffy
anyone on here: if you want, add EliSka on steam
so how's it hangin this early?
Not bad
Got a good convo going :P
pretty cool
Dken2021: it's already 3pm in the +1 timezone :P
well good for you
Eli: Invite sent :P
RaveBrony: and taken
\o/
Lyra`: you're on TF2 too right? is it possible i played with you some days ago on a brony server?
RaveBrony: Care to take a look at my inventory?
O.o
Sure, lol
RaveBrony: So you can be thinking about what you might wanna trade for?
Mega_Milk: can i add you too?
Mega_Milk: Steam name?
Mega Milk :3
Whats your pic? lol
Im the one with Mega Luna
Oh geez, haha
searching... searching... searching :P
Mega_Milk: i can't find you due to tech problems or something. just add eliska if you want. if there are multiple, the one with teh X as a profile
Mega_Milk: Aw your Balloonicorn is not usable in crafting :( and Hah! Love your strange shrtstop :D
RaveBrony: Eeyup :3
RaveBrony: I got the ballonicorn from a trade
Nice paint on it tho :)
But id never scrap it >:3
Yeah i got the paint as well ;3
RaveBrony: i have a strange scout gun, scattergun, force a nature and a rocket launcher
But I want a clean one that i will paint white and rename Rarity! :D
-lol
I just had white paint
:o
Eli: Nice :o
I traded that a pocket purrer and some strange medic stuff for the bot killer
Mega_Milk: a strange shortstop would help me tho
I only have a strange scottish resistance :D
Ive got about 9 or 10 possibly 11 stranges
i would love some strange medic stuff. it's actually my favorite class
Dont care much for stranges, becuz i dont get that many kills :D
Demoman is my favorite class, but Spy is growing on me :P
Im waiting on another trade for someone who is trading me keys for a strange sandman and pistol
So how about that Big News the Hub is supposed to tell us today?
O.o
chat derp?
nope
wonder what it is?
Trying to fix my steam >>
Cant add eli for some reason....
Err cant find him anyways...
Morning, guys
Mega_Milk: you got a strange sandman?
morning ASFT
Mega_Milk: Hes got an X for his pic
I have no idea what this big news could be. Many are hoping it's the Season 3 announcement, but it could be something completely different. Like a man with 3 buttocks.
Eli: Ive got a strange sand man, bat, milk, and shortstop
Mega_Milk: can't find you either...
maybe i could add you during a game. if we both enter the game rave is playing?
1 sec
Ill hop on my groups server
Well theres two ways to add someone :3
I added you eli
:o
Mega_Milk: gotcha
:)
why did i put pizza in the freezer?
am i an idiot?
In other news, everybody doing fine this morning?
i wanted cold pizza this morning, not frozen pizza :(
quite well, thanks for asking
FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS!
Im good, Marx, how about yourself?
Marx: Cant complain.
I'm doing good myself RaveBrony.
Lyra`: What is your steam? I wanna see what unusuals you have :$
oh btw i made me a brony skype account yesterday cuz of twi :) if anyone wants to add eli.brony he or she shall do so 6_9
Hm. So I just woke up and realised it's past 3 PM here.
:I
morning Kammerjunk
Y'ello.
Dang, if i wake up past 11am, i have a horrible day. How do you people sleep in so late? :D
RaveBrony: Lack of sleep in the first place.
years of practice
lol ^
Kammerjunk: Ah :\
well, more like I can get a good night's sleep in like 6-7 hours
Lyra`: You adorable little pony! With the cold pizza!
I had an all-nighter at a friend's house, then I didn't feel tired, so I stayed up until 3 AM the night after.
I am not a clever man.
Lyra`: Tell me your steam name so I may oggle your items >:3
RaveBrony: you wake up before 11am? where does the rave in your name come from? when i used to rave, 11am was when i got home!
Eli: I would do that same.... in Florida :'( My name is really meaningless ever since i moved to Upstate NY....
No raves, no cons, no parties.... no gatherings...
O.o
the hee is an emolga?
hell*
Whats an emolga?
this littrle bugger http://derpy.me/AZbED
O.o
Is that a pokemon? :D
yup
Thats badass, haha
Emolga. He's a Unova pokemon, a flying squirrel specifically.
Because a regular electric squirrel (Pachirisu) wasn't enough.
I havent played pokemon since gen 3 :I
they're really annoying, too fast, most of them have double team, static ability, arg >.<
Oh wow. You need to catch up. The new Black 2 and White 2 games are pretty good so far.
I wasnt able to continue after r/s/e :D
and now they have encore, great -_-
Hahaha Emolgas, the gym leader trolls you with them :D
and now i hear theres a trashbag pokemon?
Anything with Double Team is annoying.
Worse, almost every pokemon can learn that move.
RaveBrony: yesh, he's awesome :D
I like gen 5 personally
Dafuq!? Hahaha
It's the first really good game I've seen since Gold and Silver
Not counting their remakes
I cant hate on the other gens becuz I havent even given them a chance :I
Which were superb
i think *searches room* yeah there it is. a diamond edition with almost all pokemon legally caught
gen 3 was a'ight.
gen 4 was boring until I started Nuzlocking it
I LOVED g/s/c
gen 2 was the best
gen 5 comes a close second imo
Gold_Demona: it was
yea, do like gen V all together, it at least has mastered somewhat of storytelling
Yeah the storytelling is a LOT better in gen 5
Gold_Demona: gen 5 is good? i never got myself to try it really
Eli: Gen 5 is very good.
RaveBrony: http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/trubbish.jpg Trubbish
It does not surpass gen 2, but it is very good

Thats how, kiddies, real demomen demo
Lol
What the hell happened to the chat?? lmao
Me
I'm sorry
I borked it
AGAIN
D:
It died right after I said "Morning, guys"
Oh hey, ASoftFluffyThing :)
Didnt see you there :o
hi RaveBrony
I like how I am downloading 10 things, and my brain is like "Y u so slow internet!?"
silly thing
Usually chat awakens when a stream is on O_o
Lol :D
I poke it with a stick
that seems to work too
Well, ive got class in half an hour anyway :\
I'm back!!!!!!!
Its fun to also leave a flaming bag of poo laying around next to it. It stomps it out everytime!
and i'm doing the survey, done with the A Movie, and the pony episode..............still picking the B movie
No. The random will never stop.
Pick CHUD
Dark92Enigma: Woah! Thanks for reminding me! :o
that is what I am trying to get shown
I've been trying to get Kung Pow to play here ever since I came here
Bronystate, Y U In My Spam Folder!?
^
i'm trying to pick a halloween themed movie
so it can match the NOSTALGIAWEEN month
*i decided to call this month as NOSTALGIAWEEN
Well both my movies are horror themed :D
Well, my A movie is Casper
If you're looking for something old and corny to watch, I recommend "The Pumpkin Who Never Smiled"
it fits, because it outgrossed it's budget
Casper was a cute movie imo
Gold_Demona: same here....
Gold_Demona: what's that movie about?
Oh, theres not going to be anything special done for halloween?
Not the best by any means, but it's cute and fun, and I'd definitely watch it with my kids if I had any.
:) Everything's almost set to go - I'm bringing a surprise to galveston with me :)
RaveBrony: lol, Hell if I know.
:D
does the Tenacious D movie count as B movie?
05that went to shit :P
Has that been shown?
or any B movie the NC reviewed
RaveBrony: yes
Got to run some last minute things and I'm out for the rest of the week - Cypress can kiss my tailgate!
RaveBrony: as part of an anniversary special, but not as lottery pick
Dark92Enigma: Ah :P
HmM? Its in the 'Past Movies" tho
Mar-9
So its good now :)
I dont pick a B movie, becuz theres none i want to see :D
RaveBrony: either as lottery-picked or anniversary themed
05now that worked
What about.....Ernest Scared Stupid?
I think you have to, iirc or else it won't count as a vote
It does count. I won before and only put 'Balto' in :o
oh, ok then
I just won one pony episode so far :D
Then someone picked the pony ep i wanted :P
So, im looking for another A
I smell a ploy
dat link
Well snap :D
either that or a really rational news, whichever comes first
I'll confirm with Hub's FB and Twitter after link :I
don't they ever check their sources?
Meh
EqD? Check their sources?
hello everyone ^^
/me insert JJJ laughing
everyone exited for Fridaaay Niiight?
it's gonna be a long friday night from what I heard
why?
It is, Dken2021
Yeah
Long movie, and 3 pony eps
The longer the better Imo. :D
The source on that is Entertainment Weekly.
I just saw the post.
You guys did too.
Mhhm :P
this is planet side 2 right?
!c
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Aw :D
Come on, Tom! Get in the game!
Today, the mods will FINALLY update Tom
\o/
is Tom using a source or does someone have to put it in manually?
and then my Steam groups when crazy with linking the air date.... Hahaha
*went crazy
Dken2021, one of the mods has to put it in manually, I think.
ah, k
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/season-3-potential-air-date-yay.html aparently november 10th
Season 3 start confirmed?
EspyLacopa, doesnt seem to be confirmed
05potential =/= confirmed
I just figure that Tom is running as a script on somepony's machine and calculates the time between the current time and a future date (the next episode's airdate)
Hello everypony ♥
Yo Zelka
Zelka, hi there. We're already aware of the EW leak
If its Nov 10th, thats great! But if not, then meh. Lol
Kandarihu, close, its actually running as part of the irc service that runs tom. theres a hideous command used to enter new show dates
Phase4, I see.
Well, i have class, ill bbl :)
Hideous as in requiring that the date be converted into something that's not meant for human cognition?
If it's on November 10th, I'ma be pissed
/me has a wedding to attend on that day
you could always tivo it, or use youtube to catch it later
And since the location of said wedding is about an hour or two away, we'd be on the road early. 6, 7am early
Hmm
If I still have The Hub, I'll set it up to record. Freakin' Dish Network giving us Hub for a few days and then taking it away.
HOLY SHIET, THE 3RD SEASON IS COMING OUT ON NOVEMBER 10TH!
NO WAY?! :O i know it :P
FlutterMEDIC: 5 DAYS AFTER MY BIRTHDAY!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
10 days after my birthday XD
FlutterMEDIC, it's a potential date. It's not officially confirmed.
High five Dark92Enigma!

MacDurge: My hubby has the Black versions
Dark_Horst: i sense a Me Gusta here

Gold_Demona: so you had the 'MURRICA eagle :D I had the diaper buzzard
LOLOLOL Yeah XD
Diaper buzzard, that's a good one. :D
Did the sound stop?
Gold_Demona: well it was! :D
Also 10 november, AWWW YEAH \:$/
05MadSurge
05potential =/= confirmed
Need good rebuttals? Here're some http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2833/
huh... so they actually did throw auraxium out the window now
Wrek: unfortunately
MADE MY CHOICE
I've picked a B Movie we have NEVER SEEN yet
So did I see that right Wrek
Is the new shotgun at pester level as far as damage?
I thought I saw a tr cloaker hit you like 5 times with one before you ded
guess what is it?
btw, here's a few words on the season. it's non-spoilery in my opinion, but that probably depends. anyway, have it http://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/entertainment-weekly-announcing-season-3-premiere-for-november-10/
!!!!!!
Time to ask off for work
shut off my phone
two things are going to take up my time in November: AC3 and PONEHS
and crawl into a hole with a hand held tv.
NO ONE WILL BOTHER ME THAT DAY
FlutterMEDIC: ac3?
Dark_Horst: Assassin's Creed 3
oh that one
Wrek when in doubt, about any fight, hit the altitude cap.
in fighters
btw, you guys should read the forum threads by the ps1 veterans
entertaining
also makes you wonder what kinda game ps1 was
Squidward? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8227/
Wrek: you mean the scope being invisible?
Dark_Horst for every person that hates it there are probably like 3 or 4 fan bois
05no i mean this:
Planetside?
The "border" is gone
well... that looks pretty damn ugly
But no...
There is no drop tracker on the crosshair
Not sure if like
the standart scopestill has it
Wow.
then again, th standart scope is crap
That escalated quickly
05that scope im usign cost me 24
k thnx
05its the x8 one
05its not the standard
that thing has 0 drop
ok, the punchline is Waterworld
Wrek: btw, is that stull the NC14?
oh well, got a bus to catch.
05its the standard bolt driver
ok brb......and if i don't come back............it means i have a curfew
raa.
a semi-friend may come on later :>
o.o
tank /o.o\
I just happen to glance over and... Is he driving a tank? O_o
jeez honestly? Shoot right over a guy's hair XD
Needs moar panzerfaust
Well, I honestly hope the date of the premier is correct. It's the weekend following the end of my pony fast.
Kandarihu: let's hope :3
But I liked how they had the new pony episodes at 1 in the afternoon. It worked really well with EMN.
D:!
:D
no way, tank round > most anything else that's not 10 meters of icy steel
what happened?
05so my scope is nerfed
05my bullet drop is nerfed
05ffs
And my GPU is still unsupported
hi all
/me meditates with the rest of the chat
I wanna play this game with everything turned off and the resolution at 800x600 :)
Kurra ....interesting
I am trailing edge. I play games on hardware that is a joke, because nothing brings happy returns like rubbing it in the face of hardware comsumerism... maybe <_<;
well, that is a joke 6 years later
I'm going to get a 360 in 2020 :D
lol Kurra
What?
All that you said
I didn't get a PS2 until uh... like 2007 I think
Yeah, I'm usually late to the part in that regard as well.
perty*
party*
hmm
/me wants to be the latest evar
dat typing fail
so apparently D3 premiers on the 10th at 10am
S3
D:
Is that 10am EST?
05potential =/= confirmed
i think?
Is there any OFFICIAL word on this?
05nope
I didn't think so
05hence
05potential =/= confirmed
Right
okay okay look.
i am looking for it
this might mean EqD might retract their post if they can't get a legitamite source on it then
>caring about eqd
hey everypony :)
yo Sketch_Toku_Brony
and ya, i read it off EW first :p
/me BladedWings

/me yawn "Morning Bronystate" :)
There's gonna be new pony by April 2014. There just is. So you're getting it then. I confirm it myself.
:D Exaggeration upside the head!
...this game is shiny *covets*
Morning BladedWings
aww, done with Harvey's new Eyes, damn this Ending -.-
hey Lil_B. what's Harvey's new eyes?
Eli do you know the game Edna bricht aus?
/me hugs ASoftFluffyThing :)
nope. i think i have heard of a book with that name though. strange family something
Eli no I guess it has nothing toi do with it, anyway, Harvey's new Eyes is the Sequel to this game
hmm
i think it is safe to say that it can be confirmed
and it has quite the twisted ending (well, 3 endings)
Amy Keating Rogers and Meghan McCarthy both cited the same article through twitter
Ryunosuke confirm what?
earlier ... news :)
Lil_B: November 10 :$
well... still nobody told me about which Topic this is all about, but from the current information I gather that it's about the S3 Airing Date
so 10 november is season 3?
possibly
Yesh Maid_Rainbow and Lil_B :D
since it seems like it's the only source saying it is
Plenty of time to make sure I'm free that day.
I think I have a new fav Songs for the next 2 weeks
only 3 weeks to go? I was able to avoid all spoilers so far (havent heard the song, no pictures/clips either), I hope I can keep it this way :D
same here
I have seen pictures at my little brony, but no clips, and I heard one song, but that one literely Ninjad me >.<
havent heard or seen anything myself either.
05meh
05time to nap
i hear the china theme song of Generals
Wrek: But it's 5 PM. :P
Hell. :(
05they have quite a few bugs to sort
i have to go everypony
bye bye
bye maid ... admnit
damnit*
It was while driving to GalaCon, the Driver had a CD with MLP Songs, and halfway through the middle of a song I havev't ever heard "This sounds almost like it's from the show", he replyed "yes, it's a Song from Season 3" . I yelled at him to switch the song immidietly
Lil_B: DUDE, SPOILERS :D
hehe
This postb didn't included any spoilers
other than "yes, S3 has Songs"...
if it does come out on November 10 then that would be the best birthday present for me lol

Speaking of rocks, would I be right in guessing that Tom will only be updated when the "possible" premier time is set in stone?
Hangin' out with Bloonberg

Apparently there's going to be an episode centered around bullying in season 3.
Mainly how to deal with it and the cause of it
Cranberry_Scotch: if so then i hope it takes Daimond Tiara down a few notches :D
Also, it seems this season will focus on Twilight's studies
I've heard that there's going to be an episode focusing on *SPOILER*
So I guess this is going to settle whether *SPOILER* is going to be able to *SPOILER* or *SPOILER*
:D
And a certain fan-favorite villain will be returning in an awesome way
Yes. We all know about *SPOILER* coming back to do voice work

Nittany_Discord, Sumica's also on vacation, right?

Shoulda said "gone for the moment"
Nittany_Discord: I think Sumi did say he won't be here for BMN this week
11,01He has work those days.
Well the second annual Indie Games for Good Marathon is starting in about 24 hours from now. I should let you know that the first event is one of the reasons why I became a brony.

I stopped caring about the designs of the pok?mon. You're gonna get some wonky ones in every generation
The game itself is awesome
hm maybe. never tried
World tournament in BW2
Nuff said.
^
Heh
I can't do anything that requires a wifi connection, but I still enjoy it lots.
heh i haven't played pokemon after ruby and saphire but i'm not judging the newer ones i just don't have a ds
gen 3 was ok.
can't really say much about the core gameplay, but the plot's better at least
08,01sooooooooooo
The battle system in gen 5 is a LOT smoother and a LOT faster than previous gens

someone needs to update tom
November, 10, 2012
Chrysalis Hey seen the new PS2 update? 2800 MB patch with a good handful of changes
08,01but over the next week or so, one of us will probably come up with some ingenious optimisation
08,01or a few
what was the highest peak during new episodes last year?=
Grabbing now then to play tonight
i'm off from college on november 10 so i'll wake up early to watch it
08,01i think it was about 7,000
08,01might have been more
like 8:00 am
Damn
08,01Chrysalis: don't say that!
Chrysalis Check the patch notes. Some pretty major stuff is now changed
got run time from 3:20 to 0:17
they said remove this
it god damn breaks
btw, thats hh:mm
i hope i can make it
Ill be watching it on my tv anyway. So im not worried if the stream goes down :D
Chrysalis: What on earth was that system doing?
im not allowed to say
But if i cant chat, they itll be less fun
RaveBrony, my TV has no hub :<
Invi: Nuuu D:
RaveBrony, get an external chatclient ^^
Meh, i like this one D:
and...i dont know what those are really, haha.
Chrysalis: Not even generally?
whats the spoiler rule for new episodes again? one week post air date?
This is my first internet chat thingy
then use the ponychat.net mirc (same thing without a stream and bigger window)
Ryunosuke: NEVER! You may never spoil, ever!
well episode discussion not spoiler
I thot it was you wait 1 day after the ep
Then you can talk about it
Ryunosuke I think it was 48 hours or something
GilDash 'fraid not
NDA
Couldve been 48 hours, im not sure
hence why I asked NOW instead of 3 weeks from now :)
08,01NDAs suck
Chrysalis: At least you've got the brain to keep your mouth shut then. :)
Ryunosuke Seen the 2800 MB patch for PS2 today?
Necessary though, sometimes.
killerpony7733, I have not
patch notes?
i can say that its worth thousands of pounds a day
hi guise
08,01GilDash: a friend of mine here thinks you're hot
and they broke it after all my work
08,01she was looking at BUCK photos
08,01also, she's single
Ryunosuke Alot of interesting changes now umm check your client and press the newest patch note thingy
hello?
hmm
08,01GilDash: because that's what one generally does with photos
Ryunosuke Main change certs are now used to buy guns and all. And they come by every 250 xp
08,01except the photos i took of Wrek while he slept
weapons are now purchanced on certs rather than market, does it still use auraxium or cert points now?
hello? anyone?
08,01those are private photos
"so you were on a pony panel" etc etc
Ryunosuke I think so. But not sure how it works. We'll see
08,01soulero: hello! w read you, are you receiving? over
hello soulero
Chrysalis: Eeexactly. I do *not* need that right now. XD
hi soulero
Hiya soulero

Raincloud!
Small moon is small.
00,10uhhhh
Ryunosuke Yeah 2 gig+ 66 mb
00,10hold on
That stealth suit won't save you.
O.o
:(
00,10while I fix that
Sumica Oh yeah seen the update for PS2? major stuffz
Barb|CabanaBoy: I don't think inb4 works like that... :P
Easy fix: Play the song of Time to travel 3 days back
00,10joy
SafariMonkey: Well I used it that way, so what does that mean?
Yes yes. I know I am amazing
Hold your applause for later
ALL THE CLOUDS
05almond split chocolate and lemon honey tea
I get the distinct impression Dash might like clouds.
tbh I only stealth snipe about 25% of the time ;)
05niice way to end a nutbuster day
00,10why is that wrek?
05infiltrators were nerfed sumi :o
00,10lame
00,10got a link to patch notes?
05first the shotgun which i can see
hmmm
05but the scope i use
05the x8
removed stealth shot and increased falloff of projectiles
should i buy dungeon defenders
05has a completly new look down sigth thingy
Wrek Yeah and now aux is not a resource anymore and certs are earned every 250 xp and and we buy guns with that now and upgrades i think
yay i love this show
05and i cant aim with it anymore
http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/update-notes-10-18-12.33321/
05also i lost 11.5k worth of auraxium
05that wasnt converted to ceerts
05which is bullshit
I just spent mine yesterday... on a shotgun ><
BUT
00,10they removed unobtainium?
00,10yeah
05aye
Sumica Pretty much
00,10that's crap
Cert aquirement is 250 rather than 1000 xp
00,10so a kill
00,10or 3 caps
http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/1137416715666654556/809899D79C0486FC4569C8A9F40A1B7CC9E2D244/
i have 0 ammo
05Sumica: oh! and they removed my dalton
Wrek: oh yeah, continuing my question from earlier: where'd you get the scope for the bolt driver? bolt driver sint listed in the infiltrator's cert menu for me
00,10cause you have to unlock it
Can we watch the episode that shows how pixels are made?
Its my favorite.
05i can still equip it but it appears locked
05its bullshiet
dark use one of the other rifle certs
Huh?
No. Not the dalton
THose fiends.
you'd think with 2 gig updatesevery other day, bugs like those would be fixed
there is so much red text
AH
they're minor, really
MY EYES!
Oh be quiet. Suffer like the rest of us.
^^
I will
00,10so did they say they fixed instant action again?
now to see now much falloff there is
falloff = the distance at which bullets start to fall
05aye
05they did buff the liberator with aprox 10% though
I'm back guys! 10 NOVEMBER!!! \:$/
Lol

09,01basically she had to be alone too long at home and she was obviously sad
09,01because she's very friendly and likes being around people
09,01so we had to give her away to some family friends so she wouldn't have that problem

NewDCD Well, good to see you back though. I began to miss the green touch in the chat. :3

00,10still dont get the spageetti thing
Damn my grammar!
/me is not completely English good :P
it was from a story that involved social awkwardness
and for some reason guy had spaghetti in his pockets
You know... i have 9 assignments due today.. and yet im watching how pasta is made :D
ha just saw the "Yo Brony!" on Hasbro's MLP page. :D
from that day on, having spaghetti falling out of your pockets is a synonym foor awkwardness
Woah
Mmmm pasta! :Q
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
So much Tom abuse :D
Sumica: The amount of spaghetti that is said to be flowing in a story is how embarrassed the protagonist feels.
ASoftFluffyThing: we need to update Tom!
anyone else suddenly hungry for pasta?
Tom needs updating?
MadSurge, yes we does
SafariMonkey, yep
next episode is probably airing at november 10th, poor tom doesnt know shit
Chrysalis_: I'm eating pasta now
oh, a date has been announced?
Dammit, I wish we were having lasange :S
Serenity mines cooking ;)
ASoftFluffyThing: I typed that before you all said that. :P
10.11.2012 a day to remember
Sumica: For example, "it's fallout spaghestria in here" would mean embarrassment beyond comprehension ._.
twilight_sprinkle: yep ttp://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/entertainment-weekly-announcing-season-3-premiere-for-november-10/

alexxm braces
i think he means 10th of november
ah ok
you know, dd/mm/yy
00,10that's why I use the month name tather then number when I shorthand it
I prefer to think of it as 12/11/10
00,10that way no one is confused
Wait, why would you get braces at a hospital? I thought they would've been sold at a clothing shop :S
:3
I prefer 21/1/12
Sumica: actually that is better.
Polydunami: I'm at Britain
http://i.imgur.com/qbkLG.jpg three weeks, one day and 19 hours to go
final countdown
Yeah, it's strange. We call braces suspenders and suspenders we call garters.
Serenity: it's a sign, the writers like europeans better :D
the final countdown~

There were never any voiced appearances of Mario before Super Mario 64 iirc.
Pony head writer Meghan McCarthy tells EW that season 3 will focus on main pony Twilight Sparkle as she advances in her magical studies: “She’s been in Ponyville for awhile now, and so her journey is going a little bit further,” McCarthy says.
then we are really airdate trolled
i smell delicious worldbuilding
Because Britain's there, MadSurge
crazypony looks like somebody relied on the concept art
crazypony: that image is made from OOOOOLD vectors.
00,10and I smell spoilers Dark_Horst
is this official? (stream)
Kandarihu: Mario had some little voice clips in Super mario world for SNES
Sumica: that's a spoiler?
09,01Bowser has sure let himself go
That name
NewDCD: Ikr :D
Serenity, only baby Mario in SMW2.
Wait a sec, this show was made before Sonic 1...
a hint in which general direction the season will go doesnt look that spoilery to me. oh well
09,01dat pun
theres spoilers flying in the air :D
LUIGI INVENTED THE SPIN DASH
In SMW, he would say "Aegh, mamamia" when he ded
09,01and then Mario took a dip and became a bishonen
SuperBrony: providing fact out of nowhere
Serenity: you mean SM64?
/me noms on Dken2021
No, Super mario world
/me is nommed D:
Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World.
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: You know there's another Mario cartoon, right?
NewDCD: and Luigi became a woman :D
09,01oh lord I smell a diaper fetishism episode
they are cutting out the gore/
11,02VenHur: What cartoon? o.o
What is this?
EAT THE BABIES
NewDCD: why.jpg
NewSuperBronyU: Saturday Supercade.
I don't recall any voiceover in the original SMW2 or SMW
it's a good thing, Dark_Horst. season 2 lacked twilight sparkle episodes.
....whis is he wearing that diaper?
So this is before Rugrats?
09,01Tommy Pickles
09,01Baasus

09,01Googoo Gagaa Koopa

09,01>toddlers will do your chores
why get children to do it
09,01CHORES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
i'm kinda hoping for more coninuity between episodes
someone had states there will be none
that slice of life style they had so far was nice, but i wouldnt mnd story arcs at this point
Dark_Horst: in this show? Nope
-s +d
Mary-o's?
09,01I'm guessing creating that whole setup took a hundred times more work than just sweeping the fucking floor yourself
YES
00,10fast acting stuff.
MMMBABBY

LET HER DROWN
09,01DEAR LORD SHE HAS A BOSTON ACCENT AND HUGE FEET
Wow, even her clothes are affected :D
IT'S AAAWRIGHT
09,01THE HUMANITY
so hey, how bout that S3 announcement finally
says the lizard in a diaper
NewDCD: Nothing wrong with that...much
but someone designed a consistent background world. we will not see nonsense like dams and construction sites anymore
ded
09,01The Mario brothers know nothing about proper parenting
GUISE new MLP season! I can't for S2!!!! :3
do they all jump into the water to become the same age as peach and go into an interdimensional pipe to grow as old as they were and then come back knowing the time theywasted waiting to grow up
?

Wait, season 2?
I was joking.....

09,01CALL OF DUTY: MARIO OPS
i should write this show. my ending is better
Oh, whoops. Can't tell a joke on the internet :S
NewDCD: >:U
I'm still waiting for Genndy Tartakovsky to come on board for Season 4.
soulero: i can guarantee it isn't.
I think this is where Nintendo got the idea for Baby Peach...
09,01Spider-Peach
09,01Spider-Peach
Does whatever a spider-peach does?
I never liked this show.
Peach-Birdo
VenHur: Yeah, but I wanted the shoot Babby peach ded in Mario Kart Wii
09,01oh lord you pedo
00,10and where weegee got his yellow streak
BIG SUPRISE
Big tree
And then she died

Bronysith: he doesn't act like a pussy all the time?
00,10he becomes rather bad ass
Bronysith: but he got denied
00,10and then he takes a lance to the face
soo... this is this Gundam Anime this Island is upset with...
not upset...
whats the word I want...
opsessed is what I ment : D
i still dislike shinji, whining while asuka got torn to shreds, and then almost destroying the world just because of his girlfriend
traiter
Back! :)
ohai sonicdude558
Welcome back sonicdude558
twilight_sprinkle I hate asuka because Shinjis mental state was getting better by the day, untiul, Asuka came and set him back
smirnoth?
wut
dat post
this movie?
... Castlevania? you got me interrested
Lil_B: still, he shouldnt have sat crying on his ass while her guts were being torn out
08,01wait
08,01what the fuck are you guys watching?
^
twilight_sprinkle I think thats a Stituation you have to be ypourself to understand it
inb4 oopa gundam style
/me throws Chrysalis into a bonfire
08,01i can play gangnam style on the piano
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/17/FnQM9jpCikKOM4PyN1AzuA2.gif
Lil_B: nothing justifies letting someone die just because you feel like crying
Shinji is a great character
shinji is a moron
mormon
:)
twilight_sprinkle: you are thinking of End of Evangelion anyways
TAUMATONS
twilight_sprinkle I think I have to see the scene again, to see how exactly he was behaving there :/
Bronysith: ive only seen the movies
ololool death
twilight_sprinkle: yea, End of Evangelion
Oh no, automatons!
Shinji is a great character in CONCEPT. In execution? he's an annoying little twit who constantly frustrates the audience.
Lil_B: and again, destroying the world to save his girlfriend is dumb
^
i'm a turtle.
still better than tidus RAWRity
BEST EXCUSE EVER
Bronysith: that's like being more fragrant than septic tanks
well yeah, as a character in terms of quality, shinji isnt bad, but i dont like his character
twilight_sprinkle yeah :/
Simon the digger is better character
and so is Kamina
oh god.
double bazoooooooooooooka#]
DOUBLE?! AND Burst mode????!!!!
that's a definition of boomage
Kamina is a wonderful lovable character
Double bazooka all the way! So intense!
Bronysith: Simon had support... Shinji never did. Shinji is a study in the emotionally scarred, rejected and manipulated by his father- and damn near anyone else to boot. It's no wonder he was so wonderfully bucked up.
What does it mean?!
yeah, shinji was greatly manipulated by his father
Kencolt: exactly
00,10way to go saji, you done fucked up

people R ded... Aint that a bitch.
Bronysith: So... I can't hate Shinji. Necause he really had no choice-- he was never really given one. Simon WAS given a choice-- and became freakishly awesome.
is the evil spanish guy dead?
dat shadow
Kencolt: i dont hate shinji,
00,10old one Bronysith
Kencolt: simon is just the better character cause he got over it
/me licks Sumica s shins
i dont hate shinji either, i still dislike him though
Bronysith: Switched bodies with Rarity ._.
Started a gang with Derpy.... hahaha
I really hate Animes with this way too heavy imigery alla "LOOK! it MEANS something :O"
...
Bronysith: Because he had the opportunity. Shinji is a tragic character. (He was also part of whatever the hell goes through Anno's head.)

No I got it at Hot Topic. They also had Rainbow dash
o
THAT
OH I REMEMBER NOW
Lil_B: The entire point of animation, very often, is so you can show things that are NOT POSSIBLE. Over the top is part and parcel of the genre.
:|
Lil_B: better than the anime being fully about "ermahgerd look at dem explozisions" like dbz
Kencolt: I object.
twilight_sprinkle yeah, I only really enjod the first Dragonbalöl where Goku was a Kid
Kencolt: Go watch "Here and there, now and then" :P
RAWRity: "Kill 'em all" Tomino :D
00,10My buddies bro, ma buddys
Vordox: And go watch old Popeye cartoons. I'm saying that the original purpose of animation was to show not-possible things.
he knows
I watched all the DragonBalls
hes just...
howdy everypony!
hello Michael
Kencolt: Mickey Mouse 1920~ :P
He died for Nsync?!
00,10oh and yes that was pinkies VA

I didn't hear it Sumica
film grain?
Kencolt: Who knows. :) There was some who tried to ccatch realism before creating it :P
:(
Kencolt: But do not know which began first.
00,10the one with the curly pigtails
Pimpslapp'd
00,10she has not spoke much
this anime looks bomb
Kencolt yes, over the top is good, but mostly in comedic ways (like most western Cartoons) when the anime trys to look real together with Scy Fi elements than I'm ok with it, but the way it is presented to me I often don't like, but mybe tahats just my opinion
00,10yep
hello CCCP
Yaaaay :$
/me hugs Michael
hey CCCP :)
Lil_B: Which you are entitled to.
00,10damn you shinji......er I meen saji

hmmm I wonder if people had watched anime stoned before o.0
Hello CCCP
anyways
oh, gundam
Gundam style
lol
Kurra: *soviet animations
Hey man--
hi sonicdude558
Kencolt yes, because if everyone would think like me, we wouldn't see these types of Animes, so I'll guess that enough people like it :)
HES A ROBOT
you know the country that gives Vancouver a run for its animation money? RUSSIA.
Lil_B: Trust me. We do.
can you imagine? From outta nowhere, RUSSIAN ANIMATORS
wat
