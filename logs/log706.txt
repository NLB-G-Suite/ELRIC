DerpyMuffins: If you want a Derpy count watch OtakuAscended's Pony vids
I memorized almost 95% of this song. :D
4
how can u barrow apples
*I've
Dat RD
cider cider cider cider cider
This song is THAT catchy to me. :D
Everyone wants to get drunk
Or atleast I do
cider isnt alcholhol...
is cider alcoholic? ive never had cider
It can be.
^
I've had normal cider.
^
5
its like i go to food 4 less and ask to barrow an apple and take it and leav
I had alcoholic cider before
I give respect to anyone who can sing this
twilight_sprinkle:no its not its just grape juice exept kinda diffrent
Maybe this cider is spiked, explains why everyone wants it so bad...
DOUBLE BONBON!!!!
seriously this song is a mouthfull
omg dat music
apple*
sonicandmario85: except apple?:D
they are addicts, all of them
Derpy
6 derpy
lolz
and the apple family is the cartel
twilight_sprinkle:i meant apple
sonicandmario85: i know :P
Hmm the line seems longer than the number of ponies there
dat apple bloom
The Cartel family
dat big mac
lolz
yeup
75/25 is NOT fair
^
DEAL!
75/25 Not fair
Green=Evil
60/40 is more fair
Fuck you Flim and Flam
50/50 is best deal.
CrimsonPhoenix: 50/50 is fair
99/1 is fair
otakon: on the other hand, they couldve just taken over the business entirely if they wanted to
they would still earn more than with their constant supply shortages
of course that's comprimising deal
100/100 is best
twilight_sprinkle: true
Flim and Flam are swindlers
and had no work at all
Dat hard work
Big mac is best colt
Maid_RainBow: how are they swindlers?
lol
dat poor RD
:D
and WHO is Pete?
Dat Flim Flam again
wait is that morning dew?
i like how they fix the fence everyday but they still break it any ways
That fence... ;~;
poor fence post
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
did you know , the ponies ran human civilization to extinction
Dat RD
poor RD
XD
RD wants to get drunk
DaringDerpy : they are trying to swindlel there way into ponyville via cider and 75/25 issent fair deal
DerpyMuffins: :D
Like I used to
dat apple bloom
RD has drinking problem
Ditto
dat FACE
lolz
Dat face :D
Maid_RainBow: their machine does all the work, so why should the apples get more?
dat pony face
saw adventure time today, it was so stupid
DerpyMuffins:if it was alcholhol they wouldent allow it in the show remember kids watch this too
Maid_RainBow: they make it a lot faster though, and its good, so they could take over if they wanted to
25min...
08,01is it tabitha who does Granny Smith too?
dammit AB
Need a hip Granny?
Think so.
What's a matter Granny McFly...SCOOTALOO?
oh shit its on
if ponyville weren'T dominated by old, established business nobility, but were a free market, they had every right to sell there
otakon: :D
dat face
i agree the can have a bigger cut but 60/40 seems a better deal because the apples do all the work making the apples
yeah
exactly
99/1 is best deal
dat music
otakon, tabitha also does Mrs Cake
it takes longer to GROW the apples and more work at that then to process them
99.9/0.1 is better
FAITHFUL FARMER
CrimsonPhoenix: like I said I love her voice work in this
twilight_sprinkle: :D
i got the strangest boner right now
100/0 is better twilight_sprinkle
ooooh nooo
the end of the story: ponyville will continue to have supply shortages, nothing has improved, but the apple cartel still gets all of the profits
oh hai
derp
DerpyMuffins: naw thats too much
TIME TURNER
hiya Dr. Hooves!
nice ryme
Dat pilot glasses
Dat Doctor
His hair is a bird
otakon, Time Turner Time Turner Time Turner Time Turner Time Turner Time Turner Time Turner
doc hooves
Time Turner, Dr. Hooves, etc.
CrimsonPhoenix: no :<
CrimsonPhoenix: NO Dr. Hooves Hasbro already said so dammit
ok dirty joking bad ....mmmkay'
bad'dun
<3
DerpyMuffins: he's not it's the connection
What's so wrong with time turner anyway?
it's a cool name
i would love to nuzzle Big Mac
DerpyMuffins: sheep keep nibbling on the ethernet cord to his house
CrimsonPhoenix copyright issues
CrimsonPhoenix: thank you
dat face
I have no prblem with it, but i prefer Dr. Hooves.
Apart from live viewings, this is the first time I've seen a pony episode broadcasted on Bronystate
CrimsonPhoenix HP had it first
08,01oh my
08,01dat big macintosh
magmablock: it's like a Blue Moon, happens sometimes
oh boy RIDE RIDE :$
I personally like Time Turner more since it's FITTING in the MLP universe and DOESN'T pander to the fanbase
and then Big Mac had a heart attack
Dat magical cheating
CrimsonPhoenix: I can understand that.
this is not fair
0,14but foreverpandering is awesome!
If the brothers said no, this episode would be over right now
the apples lost the farm and he was bed ridden for the reminder of his life...
SaxyPretender, shame he closed his youtube account
fin
DerpyMuffins: Checked the OtakuAscended's vid: Derpy Count in this ep is 10-11
otakon: THat's terroble. :D
they need twilight's OP magic
So cheating
0,14yeah ;__;
I love this scene
I don't know why
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I know sorry, my mind sometimes wanders into horrible places
they could just set the machine on fire and drive the flim flams out with force...at least this were honest
OP MAGIC IS OP
theyy have a fucking factory packed into a car and they have their bare hooves
Yes sir ma'am sir
08,01and twilight will sit around, "supervising"
She can press Big Mac in her sleep
what does that mean?
otakon: ..........
in my sleep
Yeah, Tara's acting was a little wooden right there
XD
Lovely HORRED
best save eber
Dem acrobatics
That Rarity "Yeah" Face
she's moving the barrels
SaxyPretender: He had the most amazing voice ._

08,01see, it's times like this, i think Rainbow x Mac is adorable
dat magic
8 derpy
BARRELS
THOSE FUCKIN BARRELS
The power has been doubled
like the crows cares, they're still getting cider fro msomepony
:S
it's destroying too many apples
in season 3 rainbow dash starts to say darling again
08,01in fact, i think that's probably one of the most sensible ships
poor tree ;__;
13http://i.imgur.com/b78aq.jpg
yeah there goes quality
apple cider with tree taste
though in a kind of a competitive way
by jove, ive got it brother! ill press this red button!
08,01considering that rainbow and appljack are very close
Shizuka: :D
Dat Shizuka
lolz pewdiepie

you got some bad apples in their DUMBASSES!

or for SOME reason
Shizuka and then the penguin became the world

So many 3 related things... NOT GOOD ENOUGH TRANSITION

hiya DerpStar you missed a SPOILER BANNING
CrimsonPhoenix: I can understand that.
Sok otakon
Hi DerpStar :)
talk about stubborn...
Whats the Derpy count now?
Of course they'll continue but they really shouldn't expect to achieve Brony fame
So how about BAAAAANE
Unless it does something thatreally makes it unique, I don't think it'll be that interesting.
HECK while doing a project you don't aim to get popular with it

hmmm... so how about... ASOT 600 next year
what's all this now?
CrimsonPhoenix: imfamy they'll have that

Shizuka, di.fm /) What's your favorite station?
DO IT
13trance and ambient, but i usually turn it off after a while because ads
13but yeah i used to have a thing where i would get a RSS feed of each week's episode of ASOT and TATW
ads arent /too/ frequent. some online radios are worse
13trancefresh i think it was?
Im going to go use the toilete and i want all of you to think of the haness crimes you have committed until i return
13trancef, something like that, it's probably in the tags of the eps i have
TOY's a wierd one
So whats the Derpy count in the chat?
ALRIGHT GUYS
Shizuka: they have full eps on youtube in 720p

Cya VenHur
more precisely FIRST WEEK of november
Yeah I got the Dusk's Dawn news from reading the topic on it on Equestria Forums. One of the fanfic writers on the board has become one of the new writer's and Dashell (the admin of EqF) is considering doing some VAing for them
http://www.equestriaforums.com/index.php/topic,10589.75.html
meaning 5th November is near the next week-end
i've not been able to tell if he's genuin or just screwing with me, hard to tell over the internet
I WANT V for VENDETTA as the movie
Who's voting with me?
Here have a ice pool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I
okay guys I'm back
that does it, im unfollowing ghost politics for retweeting an a tweet from a picture of the tortured fluttershy i saw again
my flash crashed, what did I miss?
what is every one voting for?
ponies
doctor_whooves127: US President
I vote for V for Vendetta
superretroworld: You do know that account's hacked, right?
it's Romney vs. Obama
Something in canada
because I want it to be played near THE date
AJIsAwesome|Busy: didnt he get it back?
And It's not just Romney and Obama, they're jsut the two hypest
superretroworld: Don't htink so.
Although the only reason I brought up Dusk's Dawn was trying to get away from the Season 3/banning/spoiler thing
we're not getting V for Vendetta
Lol Julia Gillard falls in india
not if i have anything to say about it
DaringDerpy: ...................
You shush
we're getting Who Framed Ronald Rabbit
what?
Buytoast, it's Roger
oh...this
DaringDerpy: The comic.
Roger Rabbit
Storm_Chaser, it pretty much is between the two. Anyone else is just going to spoil the vote in favor of the main 2
AJIsAwesome|Busy: he will never become a brony :(
True, but it's not like either of them will screw it up any less right? well Obama would lesss than Romney has screwed his own campaign xD

XD
so not like the recoil 10 AdamTheDuck. you don't have to earn the perk it's an item......is it also considerd a shotgun so the suport could add it's peariceing on top of it?
taoumi, yeah the incendiary is with the gun, it's not perk dependant.

Why does this "spider" have only 6 legs?
i just had a broken idea
and yet it might work

SirGanjalf: Because Peter Parker is many things. A skilled designer isn't one of them.

Attack of the 50ft green gimp!

00,10oi, Phase4. so what do I do to make a tekkit server?
Sumica, download the server and run it
00,10that's it/
Skorpio was a slightly better villain in the comics :D
00,10dont have to install any thing or tweek a jar file?
Sumica, i also recomend the safe creepers mod, they do damange but wont break your machinery
no jar tweeking
00,10nice
plus the technic launcher meens no tweeking in the client either
00,10every one gets one, unlesss you are JJJ
He should give him bigger dose and then just stomp on him
does spiderman just carry a paper and pencil around
hes full of shit
Such a liar.
00,10he has a utilty belt.
those guys sound high
^
^^
00,10they are baked
that's a awefulyl flooyp black jack
You must be at least this high to dress like that...
or at a convention
00,10cause no one can ever make their own glove
weeeeeee
Fortunately, webbing apparently sticks to clouds. (this annoys Rainbow Dash no end.)

MOTHERBUCKIN' APPLES

Although I do not approve of half naked human ponies
Yep, i always found this intro anime fitting.

MORE HOW IT'S DONE
MadSurge, made'
mmmm honey
I love all of you
We love you too, XylemTube. :)
i've never seen a honey jar like that
sumica most of the designs were base off of k-on weren't they?
00,10yup
I don't even know what kind of anime K-on is
i found a bee that looked half-death on my parapet, yesterday.
I gave it some honey, bees love honey:P
Look at dem laborious little fuckers
00,10K-on, Moe/slice of life/ music
Sumica: ah
moe?
i hate bees so much sumica they creep me out so much
Sumica: is that the anime with the horse guy going "PO-NEEE"? :D
00,10no, that's Full metal panic :fumofu
Anyway, she got better and revived a bit.
the horse guy is Words Worth
interesting, never seen those
Oh mai
Words Worth is kind of...mature
00,10is it time for the pony ep of FMP again?
dem optics
huh, they're doing glass fibers
00,10yep
00,10this one is kinda cool
thoughth quatz was still the higher end stuff
sup everyone!
woah
ohai BroHoof
Hi, BroHoof. :)
00,10light travels faster through expensive firber optice cable.
is dat how it's made o.o
XD
oic
http://i.imgur.com/gMKK7.jpg

DoombringerZero, thatnks for creepin me ._.
lol
thanks*
dat glass condom
oha bronystate :)
ohai*
hey valoreins
thats actually the biggest benefit, zero interference
very near zero anyway
00,10you should see how much they are installing at work
Not unless if you use the skyrim shout to
Sumica, in volume or in cost?
also, copper is now worth enough to melt down and sell if you want to replace your copper cables with fibre optics, and you make a profit
00,10volume
yeah, coppers a bit expencive. its basicly the conductor of choice
00,10runs the whole lingth of the place
i bet Vegas has tons of fiber optic
wow, where do you work
that is a lot of bandwidth
00,10Venitian
that is a pretty casino
00,10but the sands expo is part of us
big hotel?
00,10as is the plazzo
00,1047 floors
that counts as big
00,10the sands expo has all kinds of tech shows
all the strip casinos are big
00,10like CES
Phase4: ah, so that's why scavengers always try to steal copper cables from abandoned buildings?
MadSurge, yeah, they're worth a fortune
lolz, there is an NPC in GW2 named Apple Jack selling apples at an apple stand
i'm suprised you dont hear of transformers being stolen
00,10the voltage tends to keep peole out
true, but they still manage to steal power cabling anyway
00,10but we hear about it all the time people going to turn on there AC in the summer only to find people have gutted it
its easier to strip trailer parks of their copper wires
00,10and new homes haveing all the wireing stolen from them
dat sheet
00,10this is kinda cool
Okay, maybe we've gone too far in saying kida shows and adult shows aren't that different-- or movies. http://now.msn.com/paranormal-activity-4-accidentally-shown-to-kids-instead-of-madagascar-3
00,10braveman
00,10working barehaded with that
electrical cabling in the street is actually aluminium, its almost as conductive as copper, more weather resistant and crystaline. over time copper would thin and sag, aluminium doesnt
heh valve
plus a lot lighter, easier to make the poles
inb4 poni
best poni
WUT
interderps
WORST pony.
.............
that pony has been at some of the conventions
Well, that happened.

Meet the lunatic. Well, one. Many many lunatics in this show.

00,10every one is insain in their own specal way
Bye, Ordinalthrone. :)
Einstein described Insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting the same results. And on that note i bid oyu adieu
if thats how you spell it
00,10you got that backwards
Expecting different results, right?
00,10aye
dat Bonta-kun
Oh,yeah. RADICALLY change the face of Modern warfare. Into something cute and fuzzy.
i came back to say sorry for the misquote

Sumica, not sure what that is
Ouch?
Phase4: its Japan's answer to YouTube
00,10hmmm an ova for FMP, I dont recall haveing that.
00,10tempted to play
oni_link, ah, i just ment the japansese part of youtube
There's also a Japanese Youtube. but NicoNico seems more popular somehow.
Phase4: Oh. What did you encounter?
what........did you learn your leasson about friendship?
lol
???
oni_link, i'm folling related links starting at 'kokorokokoro'
Phase4: haha good times
LOL!
I just watched the latest Adventure Time episode
My face was just what
one day i will get this streamed http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091464/
Funny that I was just thinking of trying to get to Equestria LA
HAHAHAHAHA! IT"S SO TRUE!
Phase4: that looks interesting :3
*yawn* hey guys what's hap.. OOH! PONIES!
Hi, Socks. :)
dat delusion
Hey AJIsAwesome
00,10think I will call it a short night
/me wants to get to a convention
I want to go to a majot convention.
*major
yay
I've never been to a convention :'(
Thanks for the stream, Sumica. :)
Socks: me neither
I've been to more than a few-- three Worldcons, used to hit the ATlanta cons and MAgnum Opus Con regularly... last one I was able to go to was a Dragoncon 5 years ago... I miss thise days,.
Was planning to go to the Doctor Who experiance in cardiff but ye gods that was expesive!
00,10and no one notices better version =p
i do
I did. :3
Sumica: i noticed it was longer
00,10needs bacon and apple jack though so not sure if i like it
and thanks for streaming
00,10might have to stick to old one
I would like to go to comic-con and dragon-con this next year
^
Thanks for streaming Sumica :3
will be stuck in my own country that has no pony convention
I want to try to get to comic-con, e3 and at least one pony related convention
Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bqTbvYZvrM&feature=relmfu
Dragon Con-- the last time I went-- was SO INSANELY CROWDED...
comic-con was fun this year but crazy without any friends
Not sure how I would do at a proper con as a friendless misanthrope who hates crowds :P
Socks: I did well :D
Sumica, i just missed better version but i'd say stick with bacon and applejack
00,10oi Phase4 still around?
Socks: Lurk around the various video rooms and the dealer's tables.
Sumica, nicely timed /)
00,10take that as a yes
00,10so yeah PM
I'll probably go to one someday but I'd need to find someone to go with first time I think.
comic-con was full of way too many people and the lines for panels was crazy long
I rarely bothered with panels-- except the one time I was on one.
Whoo Party with Pinkie
Kencolt: What panel were you on?
I missed the korra panel cause the firefly panel was before it and those guys camped out all night
Socks: Years ago, when I was a fanfiction writer of some note... a fanfiction writer's panel. Known mostly for a Ranma fic called "Girl Days". Some people still call it the most original flavor fic ever written. I bluch now.
...Is it related to "School Days"?
spent way too much money there
Kencolt: That's pretty cool :)
I'm excited for November.
I would love to be on a con panel one day *stares into the middle distance longingly*
^^
heya proplr :)
i ran some booths at a few local conventions
In other words, with near total batchit chaos and insanity. Oh, and skewering every fanfic cliche I could find while I was at it.
MLP:FiM Season 3 + Adventure Time Season 5 = SO AWESOME /)^_^(\
/me pokes NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
one of the DVDs come with a Finn cap
heya people
hey tjitjan
Too bad my semesteral break ends at November 5. ;_;
AJIsAwesome: How long are you on bronystate for? I swear every time I come on you're here. :P
:D
I'm actually working on something right now.
havent heard 20 percent cooler in a good while
Ooh!

Plus, it's nice to just hang out here. :D
Mysterious!

Nope.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6qRoF1CbNA&feature=watch_response
lol nice AJIsAwesome
i agree with the annotations too :P
^
Its weird, I grew up with the Fairly Odd Parents and I missed Timmy's voice. Then I noticed that MLP still had that voice around, and it was sucked into it. Im relaxed. Its so pure.
*I
But oddly enough Twilight Sparkle isn't my favorite
Pinkie Pie?
AJIsAwesome: Yeah lol :P
I can understand that. :D
Weird, isn't it?? XD (its a reference and its how i feel about it lol)
Have some more music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKSuds3mgh8&feature=channel&list=UL
Ello there guys.
oni_link: Nah, I don't find it weird at all. :)
Hi, Malavolent. :)
This is such a great community :3
It sure is. :)
What are the other chat rooms like? I've only been to this one.
IDK Socks
What are you guys up to?
Ive only been here
They are mysterious places!
Of mythe and legende!
Malavolent: Im remembering old cartoons and AJIsAwesome is adding links to good music :)
:)
Cartoons such as?
Malavolent: Dragonball is one. I also mentioned the Fairly Odd Parents
Good morning Bronystate
/me licks gold_demona "Mornin'" :P
hello gold_demona
It's the afternoon here but hello gold_demona
It's 14 minutes to 6am over here. :P
14 to 3am here :P
14 to 4 AM.
Hooray for timezones! \8D/
Malavolent, Fairly Odd Parents never aired in my country, is it any good?
lol
Malavolent: I liked the earlier stuff.
It's quater to 11 here
Socks: am or pm?
oni_link, Have you seen all the dragonball episodes?
Gah, I don't want to go to warly morning classes. ;~;
am
Malavolent: I have but its been awhile
oni_link, You have quite a lot of time on your hands, don't you?
Ohai Gold_Demona! :$
hi guys
AJIsAwesome: I wouldnt either, Im not a morning person
It's been forever since I've seen any Dragonball that wasn't abridged.
Malavolent: I did when I was younger
hey spartan133t!
is this supossed to be a buffer?
Now I just happen to stay up hahaha
spartan133t: What, you don't like the black screen buffer show?
is best show!
id prefer something else
It's my favorite episode, too! :D
It's the one where the buffer spins around and around. :D
I like talking during the buffers. I dont always do it but I like talking to you all
We like talking to you oni_link :)
Talking is fun. :3
aww thansk Socks
oni_link: I've seen just a few of the episodes and it doesn't look bad.
:)
Malavolent: Maybe you should watch more? :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjb2yWmBFzo&feature=BFa&list=UL3KSTFF6Juq4
I shal listen to iTunes until a stream comes on.
AJIsAwesome: lol Im listening to it now, I never got off the playlist
oni_link: Wish I had more time :D
DISCHORD!
I'm howling at the moon, and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon!
Malavolent: you can find time lol I do it for a bit in bed after I get home from work. It gives you something to watch when there isnt anything on TV.
Alright. It is done. Reset my 151 caught save on Pokemon red.
Not that he thinks so...
Eccleston was awesome.
Tennant, though...
fucking legend.
I liked it alot too, it seems to get better as it goes along :) David Tennant is beastly
Tennant is my second favourite Doctor
After mr. Tom Baker himself
Ah, I havent seen the older ones. They worth going back to?
A lot of them yes, I haven't seen many though. All the ones with TB are awesome.
I will get on that then :P I really like the show.
It's very cheesy
But it's good cheese
Like Edam
^
Best way to put it
Doctor Who is like Edam
Like I told my brother, I like the concepts they have, but their execution could use some work. It wouldnt hurt to increase the special effect budget but than again I also believe that that is one of its charms
oni_link: The question of the moment is, what do you think...
guys
of Rose!
name garry for my new game on red
Ah good question. Rose... I can do without but I also dont mind that shes there.
isnt BBC basically public television, so I dont see them having a very big budget
XAX: and Ash is your rival?
DeadpoolDash|GW2: More viewers. People who buy HDTVs want their moneys worth
oni_link: No. Im asking for someone to give me a name for Garry.
._.
XAX: call him Blue!
classic
What did you name your main character?
night everypony im off to bed see yall in the morning when i wake up aight...........peace.
._. But his name is green in the manga.
Night, Moopy. :)
AJIsAwesome: Nothing in particular ._.
Night Moopy
DeadpoolDash|GW2: It's funded by the public, every person in britain has to pay a TV license, they have fairly big budgets for their stuff. It's not like PBS
love ya guys
XAX: yeah but if you follow the game's story its Blue XD
Bye Moopy
ah, so people pay a TV tax then
Speaking of, I barely got to the part where Yellow was introduced
oni_link: but... but... D:
DeadpoolDash|GW2: Correct
oni_link: The yellow arc is good :D
BIG IT UP! Pokemon Yellow!
XAX: I need to get back on that :P name him Green then
lame, but PBS is federally funded through taxpayer dollars in addition to fundraisers
oni_link: I guess I will.
Different places, different methods of operations
I KNOW!
XAX: Im not very creative with names lol
I'll name him OP
because OP is a faggot
>_>
XAX lmao
or because hes OVER POWERED
DeadpoolDash|GW2: The laws surrounding tv ownership are complex but the BBC isn't a goverment funded thing, it's an institution, you need to pay the license fee to own a television and hence BBC shows have no Adverts and are willing to take more risks n' stuff
ah
It's complicated to explain to someone outside the UK
Did anyone say... Doctor Who?
Crap id pay more for a higher budget on Dr. Who alone...
Hai everypony
Malavolent: yeah, weve been going on about it for awhile :P
hey DerpyMuffins
so basically what premium cable channels are like HBO and Showtime
Hey DerpyMuffins
Hi, DerpyMuffins. :)
Hiyo DerpyMuffins
Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwoaMdkQs0A&feature=channel&list=UL
oni_link, I was kinda afk for a minute. But I like where is this discussion going.
DeadpoolDash|GW2: Yeah, you pay a premium for no commercials and such correct??
Hows it going?
yes
Pretty good, DerpyMuffins.
DerpyMuffins: good so far
DeadpoolDash|GW2: From what I understand, yes, except you have to pay them if you want to watch TV at all it's not optional.
So a half tac
*tax
I like my free TV
Well I dont get it, Id have to get a different plan to get it. I watch off of Netflix
so I'll deal with commercials
I hope they update soon...
We still get the BBC which is all kinds of awesome :)
I dont mind paying extra for HD and no commercials but I dont want to get a new plan for just one channel
also, Im getting cable for "free" anyways lol
But for a small ammount of money a year you get BBC's 1,2,3,4 and 7 radio channels as well as a news channel and BBC parliment, plus all other TV ever.
-ish
I like how they do things there better Socks. Im paying for Netflix and Internet though so thats my option at the moment
well commercials help support various parts of the economy, so I'm fine with them
This is also why they wanted to get the Dish Hopper pulled. the commercial skipping feature was "interfering with commercials" since it was on by default
Fine with commercials but since the BBC doesn't have to satisfy the advertisers it doesn't have to meet a standerd crap meter all the other channels do. It can satisfy the needs of niche cultures, such as Doctor Who, no other NEtwork would put on Doctor WHo it would be too risky.
Whats the BState debate about this time?
DerpyMuffins: Dr Who and networks :P
yes
Unlucky.
we are used to it
wait thiz many ppl on in middle of night
Also its 3am here. Id love to talk with you all but Im having a hard time staying awake. Well, thanks for the great conversation. Bye Socks, DeadpoolDash|GW2/
i yhought there would be
like 2 ppl
also thanks for the music AJIsAwesome
about 2am here
Bye oni_link :)
Bye, oni_link. :)
...How are you going to get money without commercials?
Take care. :)
11am
5am
here
5:13 AM.
Spell-of-Gaming: By how the BBC does it
11:14
I've been through this!
lolz
AJIsAwesome: its 5:14 where i live 6_9
now 5:15 :P
<_<
no vid :|
There was literaly a segment which was 5mins long!
That's insane!
well that show is on in a 30 minute block
so the usually mean 5-10 minutes of commercials
derpy
But still! It breaks up the flow of the show terriably.
derpy iz bout the most famus pony to ppl
:P
Prince_Lightstar: I heard about Derpy before I heard about any of the mane 6
Anyone have a cute woona pic?
the only shows that might not have breaks in them are the 15 minute block shows
Socks: thats mah poine
point
:D
DeadpoolDash|GW2: Or shows on PBS. :P
PBS has commercials
Well I'm glad I live in a near ad breakless society. RULE BRITANIA!
Between shows
and also i was watchin background ponie b4 the mane6
They never interrupt their shows
i was lookin at djs on utube and found vynilscratch
Unless they're doing a telethon thing
I think i have seen episodes of NOVA with breaks
I never have
oh course, I havent watched PBS in forever
I do have to say the KYM video about MLP could've used more effort. It was like they weren't even trying to make this fandom look good.
HAs anyone seen the PBS idea channel?
I have.
idea channel?
One second.
It's a youtube thing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk
the KYM was pretty informative without pandering to the fandom
DeadpoolDash|GW2: Try, but I'm mainly talking about the video, not the documented information.
well it did come from 4chan
list to fav manesix
dont know y i typed six
almost nothing nice comes from 4chan
DeadpoolDash|GW2: That's true. too.
^
rd aj fs pp r tl
ponies is one of the exceptions and it was used mostly to troll

I'm at school

Oh wut
I don't own a gun, nor to I want one, but I am not against other people wanting to own them.

Dat toaster NES

MadSurge I have a rip of the 7 CD Ghost and Goblins soundtrack Collection :P
I dont even...wat
Yeah, he was in his underwears
I played the SNES version for a while once
it's so hard xD
Ah Red Arima, how I hate you
LordKat once made a Until We Win Episode for the SNBES VErsion
Lil_B: Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts?
yes
Apart from the bosses, that game isn't actually that good
even with the extra Playthrough were you have tu use the Bracelet only to get to the real Final Boss
i has to goo nao
kay, bai
Think he wants you to get the knife? :D
brb need to get something from the Kitchen
ok, now I'm suited for this game :P
Hint hint: you need ANOTHER weapon to get to and kill the final boss!
XDDDD
Ah, dat classic "hate the player" level design
yeah, in the SNES Version you HAD to play through the Game without getting touched (you are not allowed to loose the armor) to get to the Final Boss -.- I imagin it's nopt different here
Lil_B: you need the shield weapon to get to Astaroth
BOTH TIMES
MadSurge yes, and it is awful :P
lol
And the Satan boss is a really hard mofo to defeat with the shield
Oh geez the Ninja Turtles game
I'm waiting for the bit where he does something spooky or he gets scared
if there is one
thank god the post-hit invincebility xD
TWO SATANS
Yes, the cyclops boss is bugged in this version!
and the level music isn't much better :P
I need closure

XD
YOU GOT TO BEAT THIS TWICE
THE WHOLE GAME
TROLOLOLOLOL

00,03now for requested videos! Send in dem links on #Vinyl_Scratch
stop-motion animation is usually pretty good...this isn't too bad
Is it a music video?
hello, whats this?
bunch of copycats, lol
EVIL!
just a tad, Lil_B
What's going on?
some form of social critique, perhaps?
......
Is it a music video?
no, just animation
Does it have a soldier?
XD
nicely done
It might be a video I linked
this is only a music Video
If it is it's ohGr's music video for Cracker
or rather the Intro to a Game, but it is pretty much a music Video
The Game is a Point and Klick Adventure about a little Girl that pretty much is clumsy, has hallucinations and somehow kills 7 people withouit realizing it

Ministry isn't rap
It isn't even close
00,03you're not even rap :P
Scoots, you're always listening to rap
all MLG kids listen to rap
and dubstep
Am I wrong to sometimes think some peoples opinion is retarded from my viewpoint?
SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe
No, that's fine. It happens with many of us. Although, I wouldn't say "Retarded", I'd go with "A high level of stupidity."
SpadeMagnes[School]: that makes it your opinion
I view stupidity as mere inorance, not actual mental retardation
Because i watched a video and he said something about "bad" graphics and lack of voice actign affectes story telling
I personally find that retarded
No nittany yet?
hey
alright :p
Dinosaurs and nun
ok then
I hat this keyoard
I used to hat my old keyboard.
But then fedora.
Nothing annoys me more than people who think graphics make the game
Bees annoy me :S
They can though
But the story is what counts
Graphics = a way to show the story.
If you can't tell the difference between a friend and enemy then you're a bit fucked
SpadeMagnes[School]: it certainly doesn't hurt. but at a certain level it doesn't matter anymore
guile appears

How do you blow up a tank with a gun?

Spectrum_Rush: ... sad that i have never watched it, actually. hear so much good about it
Hoody|Skool: Trick question. It's the handgun from MiB.

French got cancelled at my school
Oh god damn it
MURIKA
You could blow up a tank if you're able to hit the fuel tank and ignite the fuel
epic 4th wall breaking
Rev: yeah you could think that, but fuel doesn't really ignite like it does in movies
Every car is not a pinto
00,03hope you enjoyed! :$
I know it doesn't
ty for teh stream, Scoots
It's the fumes that ignite really
thanks for the stream Scoot-Scootaloo
Yea mythbusters tried exploding a car via shooting the gas tank
Hmm, I missed a request time.
That didnt work
Damn, I gtg, latas bstate
Rev: the fuel tank would have to be about 3/4 empty and there (mlp refrence) would have to be a spark. not just a shot
Bye Hoody|Skool :)
Also you guys know those bug bomb things?
bye Hoody|Skool
i have a driving lesson today
Well I just beat Black 2's Elite 4 last night
My genesect pretty much fucking soloed the place
00,03CHEAP
SpadeMagnes[School]: there's a black 2??
And a white 2
SpadeMagnes[School]: ah... pokemon
Theres actually a medal for beating the elite 4 with a team of one type
and one for beating it with just one pokemon
Also B2/W2 is first to break pokemon tradition and give you two masterballs
SpadeMagnes[School]: haven't played any pokemon in years. i still have a almost full diamond lying around and a almost unplayed white of my little brother, but no DS i think :)
I used to remember when shiny pokemon were rare, now they just give them away...
00,03They give you a shiny gabite or dratini at one point~
and a shiny haxorus
Also Imprision is the most usless fucking move ever
It only is useful if the opponent has one of the moves you have
then use it on a smergel
I do like the new kyurem
black or white kyurem?
Black
yeah i like the black verion better too
version
Also Black and white 2 seem to be the only game so far that lets you refight legendaries you accidentaly K.O
SpadeMagnes[School] they put that feature in how does it work
yeah thats been around for a while most would reappear after beating the elite
You just have to re beat the elite four and go back to where you fought it the first time
how are ya?
Also Juniper apperently can give you a item to increase shiny encounter rates
Its fucking impossible to get though
yeah you have to complete the national dex
Yeah, it makes it a 1/3000-ish chance instead of a 1/8000+ chance.
Good luck...some pokemon you cant even get, unless you get lucky via GTC
SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah, you have to complete the pokédex to get that item
That increases shiny encounter
Well my pokedex in black was...I think 400 something
This Key Item increases the likelihood that you will encounter Shiny Pokémon. When you have the item in your bag, then the chances of encountering Shiny Pokémon in the wild is increased to 300% of normal, making it a 1 in 2,370.6 chance. If, however, you're using the Masuda Method to breed, it increased it from 1 in 1,365.3 down to 1 in 1024.
Masuda method?
I can't remember mine, can't check either due to my DS breaking.
btw if I disappear all of a sudden, its because of my hard drive ._.
I'm good, you?
D:
I stopped bothering with the pokédex after gen 2
that's not good
Heya everypony
It stopped being worth it after that
breeding with forign game pokemon
today it suddenly started freezing up
The only legendaries I lack are celibi, deoxys,mew,keldeo...and.... thats it
I checked its health and noticed the sector count dropping
I have a jirachi...
okay.png :(
I'm surprised it hasnt started clicking yet
i have keldeo
Bah, legendaries
Morning, guys
Hi Sonny
ASoftFluffyThing: morning? :p
oh
All I need is Latias and Latios.
keep forgetting the time-and-space thingy on our world >_>
Sonny, 11am for me
Ohai Sonny and ASoftFluffyThing :)
it's 5:07 here pm
heya
Sonny: Time zones. They're awesome. XD
Hai Colt_Brovakiin
10:07 here
how are things ASoftFluffyThing
It's 11am over here
Need to see if I can get my desktop working again
a.m.
Doing fine, alexxm. Just waking up.
what's wrong with your desktop?
Gold_Demona: I actually dislaike them somtimes, since their are some friends who can only come on when it's midnight
-_-
oh its just missing software
ah
How are things alexxm
I havent used it in so long because my laptops my main computer
I will probably end up getting a new laptop on black friday :P
If I see a deal thats good enough
Hey everypony
Howdy y'all!
Howdy Serenity!
oh, that's not a bad idea
Thats how I bought skylanders last year
hey Everlasting_Joy
And I've been here a year and 3 months, and just realised the pun in "Bronystate" :U
bought a huge bundle from best buy for $70 bucks
heya Serenity and Everlasting_Joy :)
how are things Serenity and Everlasting_Joy
Serenity: really?
I'm hoping they do it again this year...
lol
I kind of want a new laptop since mine's falling apart, but I can't justify spending another $1000 on a laptop when the only thing that's wrong with this one is the hinge
Brone estate :L
Howdy Sonny and Colt_Brovakiin!
$1000? o.o
yeah... >_>
I only spent $400 on this one
howdy ya'll ^^
:p
alexxm: Could be better, but I'm not complaining too terribly.
but I spent $60 upgrading the RAM on it
alexxm: I will say this, it could be Friday.
might be more now that I think about it..
I only spent like $250 on my first one, so I felt like splurging
I wanted to add a 4GB RAM stick to my laptop
Friday friday gotta get down on friday
Is DDR3 still the newest ram right now?
7 am waking up in da morningszszszzzsz *failed duckface*
I think so
I was going to pull the ram out of this laptop and put it in a new one..
hated that song so much
now if I hear it I laugh :p
I haven't heard of anything newer
awesome
mhm...
7am and I go back to sleep. -.-
well, if you're going to upgrade that laptop you should probably do something about the hard drive first :P
would be a much better version
:p
Howdy Sonny!
Any way you could just replace the hard drive without buying a completely new computer?
I saw a flipnote of that
howdy Everlasting_Joy!
I wish pokemon you got via wifi mystery gifts you could nickname
I think I finally have come to a conclusion
I was thinking of doing that
My favourite pony is
. . .
but its going to cost me close to $100 to do that
spike
/me drum rolls
thanks for that
:D
Welp, I need to sleep
bai :3
/me drum rolls
bye Spell-of-Gaming
. . .
Laters Spell-of-Gaming
what size hard drive would you get?
Bye Spell-of-Gaming
Night night Spell-of-Gaming!
Pinkie Pie! :o
It needs to be at least 200gb
Yay!~
Bye Spell-of-Gaming
since she kind of reflect my personality ^^
Pinkie is best party pony
Sonny: yay!
She's the only party pony
except that I don't have a Pinkie-sence or laugh and break the 4th wall
Gold_Demona : thats a silly way to spell Twilight is best pony
Maid_Rainbow: I didn't say best pony. I said best PARTY pony
Maid_Rainbow: I never said she was best pony
Twilight is not best party pony
Meh Pinke > Twi.
Luna is best pony
Maid_Rainbow: I said she was my favourite ^^
I really don't want to get a laptop with windows 8
oh god Everlasting_Joy don't go making sttements like that HERE O_O
Discussion alert!
>_>
NERD BATTLE
I might just stick to using a desktop
Yeah <_<
and get a tablet
Sonny: There's a difference?
MOTHER OF GOD °_°
ye Gold_Demona
I have a bunch of spare parts for my desktop anyways
Sonny: Don't you see what the fun is of this? Now I'll flee and leave everyone angry. Muahahahha!
I know a couple people who like Windows 8...
who?
IRL friends
But I'm already behind you
I just don't want to upgrade because I know some of my stuff wont work
my webcam didnt work when I changed to windows 7, same for my printer
One guy got the beta version or something on his laptop
my FAVOURITE pony is Pinkie Pie, but the BEST pony is based on what EVERYBODY thinks like who represents the most of my little pony is supose to represent or who is the BEST in being a pony
One does not simply chose a favorite pony
I keep telling them the UI is weird and doesn't make sense, and they just say "you get used to it"
so saying that a specific pony is the best pony is just your own personal choice :p
Sonny: nonono. You are confusing "best" pony with "most popular" pony. :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: exactly
Well okay, but that doesn't stop it from being a crappy design
*choose
Gold_Demona: not most popular, but the one who represent the most of what a pony is supose to represent or who has the most positive atributes
/me walks into Mordor
^DEAL WITH IT
Sonny: So in other words... None of them. :P
I just don't get why they made it transition between the "tablet/touchscreen" interface and traditional windows
just pick one or the other...
Gold_Demona: it has been scientifically proven that the best pony...
is spike
/me *drum rolls*
is....
well everypony i have to go
My favorite is twilight because..well I'm pretty much like her.
bye Maid_Rainbow
Ohai
/me eats an apple in slowmotion to add extra dramatic effect
/me *glump*
As far as personality, I'm sort of a cross between Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie.
I'm guessing that Microsoft wants to compete with apple
. . .
I saw their commercial for their new tablet too, it looks nice, I can see the windows 8 working with a tablet
but for a desktop...I dont know
Im so much like Twilight I pretty much panic when schoolwork is late
I like all the goofy fun stuff, but I'm really shy about it. ^^
damnit I can't find it O_O
yeah, I would like it tablets I think
some say it's derpy
*on tablets
some say it's Twi
It looked like there were some things that took more steps if you had a laptop/desktop
it's very awkward to use on a non-touchscreen though
/me is actually eating an apple.
at least to me
exactly, I agree
nemnemnemnemnem
/me will eat an apple at lunch :).
maybe they should've just made it a tablet OS
It IS lunchtime for me. lol XD
I think Derpy is so high rated because she was basicly a background character who was pointed out by the fanbase and actually brought into a scene
I saw a comment online a few months ago, every OS that Microsoft makes is good and bad
as for Twi, because she has somthing we all have in personallity or so I think, she's rational
Windows 98 good, windows ME bad, windows XP good, Vista bad, windows 7 good, windows 8...well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI
and she's the main character of the show (as pointed out)
haha, that's interesting
Skip windows 8 and wait for windows 9 :P
so yeah
Actually windows 95 wasnt bad right?
I'm too young to really remember Windows 98, but I remember my dad installing Windows ME...
ultimate battle between Derpy and Twi I guess °-°
I havent actually used it so I dont know..
I don't remember 95 at all haha
or hugs and nobody cares because of adorableness <3
me neither, didnt have a computer with it at the time
Despite me having a dislike for Celestia, I still hate Diamon Tiara more
ok i have a driving lesson now back in a couple of hours
But we had ME for probably like 2 weeks
earliest OS I had was windows 98
And we reverted it
*Diamond
My favorite is still XP... probably because my first laptop had it
I still like the windows 98 startup theme
bye alexxm|afk
Picture hearing that in a classroom when 30 computers turn on at once
well I find one thing a little odd in mlp fim
celestia, you know the princess?
What about her?
Gotta head off for now
be back in 30-60 minutes :)
Yeah, what of her?
me too actually
oh ok
well... she has the power to raise (so actually move) the FREAKING SUN wich is about 100000 times the mass of the earth...
I keep forgetting too to PM you
and?
and she can't even stop a single changeling queen?
But it's not Earth. It's Equestria
message me when your back on :)
Plot,magic
and I'm like... hu?
right BUT
Okay
equestria has to be a planet as well right?
see you
See ya
Not as we know it
Moving the sun =/= absolute power.
and asuming there's a minumun you can go to create an actual sun that works the way ours does
But it doesn't. :P
Heck, S2E13 states unicorns can do it.
it's jsut
It's not even a proper solar system. It's all magic.
just*
I know its a cartoon but a sun rotating around a planet sounds weird
messing up Logic
05Everlasting_Joy: no, ultimate power is when the sun moves itself for you
MEEEEEEEGIC
Wrek: have you seen nittany lately?
I need to send him somthing °-°
what if the sun is small but really close
05last i knew he was workign as a maid on new adventures
Wrek: Yay! I've been wondering where you've been :).
I'd have to say the Wedding episode cemented my hatred for celestia
Wrek: ok, thanks
/me glomps Wrek.
05^_^
ohai Wrek. :D
I'm back paesani \:3/
Howdy MadSurge.
SpadeMagnes[School], really? How? For falling for Queen Chrysalis' masquerade like everypony else and then getting her horn handed to her while fighting her?
Only one peasant, MadSurge?
>completly doubts your student you raised for years, don't apollogize when she was right
I hear again! But I gotta take some meds for the ear swelling
The fuck celestia
MadSurge: Sounds nasty. :<
Gold_Demona: that's the plural you silly :)
SpadeMagnes[School], hmm, good point.
Gold_Demona: nope, just a pill a day
I would forgive her if she said at least IM SORRY
But no she doesnt even say that!
SpadeMagnes[School]: Nobody did
Gold_Demona: so I assume you enjoyed my request? :D
Applejack did
And...?
The fact twilight's mentor pretty much mother figure, shot her down like nothing and didnt even fucking apollogize
^
I mean, I agree with Kandarihu
The way Twilight went about it, I wouldn't have believed her either. =/
Just because you're right you have to back up your claims.
I would have given her the benifit of the doubt
honestly the bigest problem is that chrysalis basically revieled herself after managing to convince twilight that shes not evil...
*still
I wouldent be so mean to instantly doubt her
05easy
doctor_whooves127: She revealed herself when Cadence showed up, and we have Twi saying "You're not the real Cadence."
05twi would know from her filly years that cadences magis is pinkish
doctor_whooves127: she was too dangerous, and thought the caves to be inescapable
05emedietly expose her casue its green
Wrek: Her's is blue.
05blue
Also the fact they blow off the fact Cadence is a total bitch
No no its just the wedding! Bullshit
SpadeMagnes[School]: You clearly haven't prepped for something as big as a wedding, have you?
I doubt every wedding makes the bride a total ass
SpadeMagnes[School]: You have no idea how stressful it is to plan a wedding.
SpadeMagnes[School]: that might be, but some brides really become bitches during the most important day of their life
Gold_Demona: were you a bridezilla too? :D
They want it go perfectly and if it isn't, there will be hell to pay.
SpadeMagnes[School]: It's REALLY nerve-racking. I can tell you from experience I was NOT myself during the months before the wedding.
Those reasons are why Girlfriends are out of my question. Too much hassle
Yea but no one even bats a eye thats was gets me
MadSurge: No, but I was a nervous wreck
05Serenity: girlfriedns are awesome
brb
What's a girlfried?
SpadeMagnes[School]: That close to the wedding, I wouldn't be suspicious either.
05as are wifes, problem comes in the transition
SpadeMagnes[School]: The others got wrapped up and bitchy brides are expected.
Is it a new Macciedee's meal?
05besides nowadays a marriage isnt more than something financial
Gold_Demona: I can imagine. A wedding is also a big chore
Also since twilight was raised by Cadence for awhile it would be easy for her to tell if she was actually her
MadSurge: No kidding! My wedding was just a little traditional one, but dear GOD there was a lot of planning involved.
SpadeMagnes[School]: yes, but only her knew Cadence really well
So many choices to make!
If I ever get married, the last thing I'd want is for everything to go perfectly. I'll remember the wedding only for what went wrong, and I'll laugh.
05like inviting me to a wedding
Kandarihu: great attitude dude :D
All getting shoved in your face... @_o
Wrek: Whats the worst you could do?
05next thing you know there will be metal music from the organs and permafrost
^:D
05aswell as booze
Wrek: FUCK YEAH VIKING WEDDING
It's not a wedding without booze.
I know it has nothing to do with the plot but you would think the crowd would notice "Cadence" singing about her evil plan
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHPOesXCFcI
I would ban booze at my wedding
^
SpadeMagnes[School]: It's called soliloquy.
The choices... The choices... Th cake... the music... the damn flowers... the catering... the church... the dance hall... coordinating the bridal party...
I. Hate. Drunkards. More. Than. Anything
05maybe at the actuall wedding
05but then comes the after party
Im still peeved Luna did nothing in the episode
05cermony*
I wouldn't have an after party- unless he or she wanted one- but even then, no booze pls- for my sake
SpadeMagnes[School]: noone bats an eye at songs. She might have sang under her breath for as much as we know
05you say no boose
>Gets married > Dies of alcohol poisoning.
What?! Not even champagne?! Travesty! No bridal toast?!
Alright. I'm not an alcoholic, so I wouldn't have booze at my wedding. I'm a geek and a gamer and I would be bored if there were nothing of interest at my wedding.
05clearly you havent had snaps with me
SpadeMagnes[School]: although yes, Luna needs more action
05so much fun
;__;
The did I miss anything seems so trollish
Kandarihu: same
?
Pondoo
05Everlasting_Joy: if i ever visit the US
I'm not an alcoholic either, but I don't believe you can raise a toast without champagne. >.>
05ill brign a bottle of snaps
Wrek Ice cold snaps=oh god kill me
what a pic to choose for boxart for one of your flagships :S http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/303/057/925.png
05and 2 glasses
SpadeMagnes[School]: nope
scchhhhnaps
No luna you didnt miss much, just the invasion of canterlot...
Wrek: I'll hold you to it, but you'll have to travel a LONG way to find me :(.
Spectrum_Rush: :D
Good morning mah brownies!
Hiyo Panda :D
Ohai Panda :)
Mornin' Panda!
I've never really had a bad alcohol experience, and drunk people can be fun, I just don't enjoy the thought of being drunk
:D
Gold_Demona: me neither, and I HATE champagne (and all alcohol :D )
/me glomps Gold_Demona
But the one time celestia actually takes action herself she gets her flank handed to her....usless princess
05who said anythign about beign drunk?
05tipsy at best
Hello Panda :)
05its the smashers you should avoid
/me waves to everyone
^
True
True, if you're going to drink, that's a good attitude Wrek
MadSurge: For me it depends on the champagne. Some are good, some are not. Luckily the one I had at my wedding reception was REALLY good. :3
My brother
The bastard knocked me round the head and cracked my skull >:U
I don't mind having a drink now and then, but I don't enjoy being tipsy or--anything
Serenity: :(.
Gold_Demona: aww yeah! :$
05worst part about being drunk
The hangover?
05you loose cigarretes in the thousands
05i dont get hungover
Thing is, at events like that, you trust everyone to drink responsibly. I was fortunate enough that there were no drunken incidents at my reception.
And Wrek, keep then in your frontpocket?
Why? Cuz everyone drank reasonably
^:)
Hello Bronystate ^_^
I sort of understand the news about the 13 episodes froma buisness standpoint...but i still find it stupid
Howdy BladedWings!
05Panda: i recall ocne i went otu for a smoke wit ha couple of friends
Gold_Demona: luckily I have a very phlegmatic nature and I don't get nervous very often... but a wedding is still a big thing
05we ended up in our haze to smoke 6 each in a row
05jstu casue we wanted to keep the convo goign
13 episodes news is part of the reason, not the full reason
05so we kept littign new ones :|
Wrek, so you smoke more when you are drunk?
05aye
:/
Perhaps when you go drinking, bring only one pack and some bubble gum, Wrek.
05mine has mint filters
05and 1 pack wont help
05i do onyl rbing 1 pack
but everyone else also have cigarettes, I guess
05and then people beging to give eachother and beg from eachother
05eets silleh
here, all the rage is doing snuff instead of cigarettes
it's--WORSE
they spit that crap everywhere, our college even had it under the mixing desk in the STUDIO
eww.
05snuff as in nasal? or snus? :P
and all the pretty little dancers would wrench their lips open and spit on the ground
snus yeah
noone aims at the garbage can
snus? O_o
Eww... that's one type of smoker I hate Wrek, one that begs -__-
Vivix: Well, that would require effort.
05kidn of liek chewing tobacco but without any chewing
I think it's--pretty european, it's like tobacco you stuff up under your upper lip
Wrek: Ew! O_o
all the 18 yearolds here are doing it
That's.... really weird
Don conform
Dont*
05it has its ups and downs
all being 40% of the smokers I guess
05for isntance in a proper friend circle
05we can be indoors
05no one has to go out for a smoke
05and theres garbage cans a plenty
http://memegenerator.net/instance/28914917
True
XD no ashe trays around?
05smoking indoors isnt very...
In our school we would find the snus like- stuffed on windows sills, tables, everything, even if there were garbage cans like 1 meter away
Ash*
05polite
http://fav.me/d5iakfc
05Vivix: casue its a school
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM Tetris Time!
05with you know
05teenagers
Celestia is actually just pretending
well, 18+ hehe
05and they cant sue their brains
she's over 1000 years old so she has to have somthing to do
:p
well, if noone minds, I don't see the issue in that :)
but yeah, snus and coffecups, Eveyrwhere. by the end of the year the chef was screaming at us in the all-room about his rapidly decreasing cup-stock
05what about the smoke settign inside the walls
XD
05lowering the value of the property
Yeah, that's worse
especially ceilings, you have to repaint and everything
You can't repaint it... trust me
all hope is lost-
It seeps through
ew~~
05parintign wont fix it
05hence
05balconies
05<3
^
Eeyup
hehe yeah, all polite people tend to smoke outside now
Maybe that's why snus is more popular at winter
Wrek, before I moved into the house I live in now, I lived in a townhouse that was previously occupied by a smoker. Mom and I lived there for about 6 years, and the lingering smoke gave her headaches.
Well, if you want white walls, you better go outside xD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdkJN_Zgtgk Mario Time
05Kandarihu: proving my point further
05only smoked indoors twice iirc. 1 being on the trainstation in the smokers room
Well, my grandparents own a house and they have a designated smoke room.
I used to work in some communal crap for young people without jobs, and we cleaned some old guys appartment- with like 5 year old cans of cereal, and--YELLOw walls and ceilings
horrible
05and otehr on the airport being smokers room
05then id ecided not to use smokers rooms anymore casue you cant breatehr in them
Cuz its heavy flow
Near non stop
05no cause they are tiny and cramped
That too ^-^
tiny + smoke = bad
Maybe its to get people not to smoke, I dunno.
I quit a while ago... so...
05ive been smoking less and less
Wrek: Sounds like a bathroom on campus here.
No ventilation what so ever :|
05yay for burritos then
Wrek ^-^ that's good! Live longer to do more arts and for your love xD
Wrek: Thankfully, I never use it :).
You don't use the bathroom??
05he uses a bucket
Sneak and use the faculity one
Panda: That specific bathroom silly.
05and throws it out the window
^-^
05like its 1776
I know
XD
Wrek: I thought I said to keep that a secret! ;).
05hehe
If that were the case though, I'm lucky. I live on the top floor.
Haha, but smoke rises
Panda: Yeah. . . Rises.
05Panda missed the point entirely :P
Summer would suck. So bad
Panda: Last year, I stayed on the bottom floor, the smoke ALWAYS flowed into my room.
Did not Wrek!
05we talked about excrement
05and then suddenly smoke rises
Everlasting_Joy, that's why I'm glad I live in a smoke free area
Wrek, this is bstate. Conversation never stays on topic xD
Meh, I lived. Once winter rolled around, it got a lot easier.
05peopel stopped smokign in the winter?
05what kind of country does that
"I did not hit her I did naht"
Wrek: There's a Minnesota joke here, but I won't bother with it.
05speakign of winter
Oh hi SpadeMagnes[School].
05its been -5 all day
... I d Oidn't know that smokers hibernated
Didnt*
05once the next batch of rain comes we will have snow
Go go envirobear
Lucky
I want snow
05but can you take the cold?
Of course
Wrek: Too bad it will be sloppy wet stuff.
05Everlasting_Joy: not really?
05its cold
05so the rain will freeze on reentry
Went snowboarding with a tank top on xD I'm very insulated
05demperature Panda`
05?*
05t^*
It snowed here today
for a shor while
Still no snow here is Wisconsin land
*in
Hm... fluxuated between 15 and 30
05aaah wisconsin, where polka comes from
Wat
We're expecing some snow, but during the day, we're above freezing; at night, it's below.
05Panda: is that celcius, kelvin or madeupature?
Im pretty sure we're all about cheese...not polka
Though, I can say I didn't last long with a lack of clothing
Um... ferinheight... how ever its spelled Wrek
Panda: Like he said, madeupature.
05so at its coldest it was -1 celsius
05we currently have -5 outside
05winters usualyl hit -30
/me shudders
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Instrumental Music: Winter Unwrapped / Firewall's Got Swag! / Solar Empire plains of war
We usually don't go below -25, but last two years it has been crazy cold-
05so thats... -22 farenheit
Pfft, I've been in winters that cold and I'm alive.
But I've been in below 0 weather before while I was there. We arrived at the coldest time of the year and it stormed xD
05Everlasting_Joy: not the point. the point is when panda sasys he can onyl wear a tanktop in -30
Not minus 30!
My bad.
Did I say minus weather? O_o I can't be that tired
05all you need to survive is a proper jacket, maybe gloves and a proper pair of shoes
Pants
You need pants
05jeans will do
Eeyup
A good coat, hat and maybe boots and I'm set.
Though jeans are uncomfortable to board in xD
05but yeah
05the coldest winter ive had
It's funny, jeans don't seem to keep you warm, but they do it so well.
05cant recall how cold it was
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_CY0HcIws A wild pokemon appeared!
05but it was liek havign a popcible agaisnt your entier face
Use your nose drippings as chopsticks Wrek
05and it istn melting
05and it doesnt egt warmer
I once got a brainfreeze walking home from school. That was probably the coldest I've experienced-
The coldest winter I remember was when I was in 8th grade, around 2003.
/me never wears a hat
or lue, whatever that is in english
I love how quickly the chat moves. Alcohol>smoking>winter
05i fail to wear a hat aswell
/me wears hats
I remember for about two weeks, the high was in the -20 to -30 F (-28 to -34) and the nights were even worse.
05i usualyl jsut use the hood on my hoodie if its too cold otuside
I always wear mah beanie ^-^
05sounds heavenly Everlasting_Joy
Everlasting_Joy: where do you live?
05a cold calm winter night when walkign on the road only to be lit by street lights and havign a thermos of coffe in your pocket
05its awesome
Wrek: There's a reason Minnesotans are teased about our winters, because they are true some years.
hellau everyone
Howdy artist!
Winter and streetlights give me a lot of nostalgic memories
I don't need a hat, my hair is already gigantic and warm :D
Ah minnesota!
I mean the sun goes down at like..3 pm 2:30 in winter?- so many school memories
Wrek: I prefer it when it's snowing, but yes :).
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB87TndHlFg&feature=related
MadSurge: :D
I like winter at night, its always so bright
Anyways, I'm gonna run some errands guys :)
Be back later
Spectrum_Rush: There's a certain sober feeling to them, especially when there's a full moon.
Sonny: hey you!

i was going to ask you something :3
05or work on luna and watch mars attacks!
05choices choices
work on luna then.......marsk attacks!
mars*
Forgive me for never hearing of "Mars Attacks!", but that sound like something form the '60s.
admit it you read it in his voice http://derpiboo.ru/130553

Spectrum_Rush: Yes.
then the fire nation attacked
Everlasting_Joy: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116996/
Spectrum_Rush: i dont know how his voice is in English, still i have an idea
05http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116996/
Wrek: ninja'd :P
Now I know :).
:P
05its my b movie choice so :D
/me breakdances
05also voted the extrended cut of the abyss for A movie
05that shit is 3 horus long man
At least it isn't 6.
Ah, I have to throw stuff at the vote
or..lott
o
Sometimes- I miss the "edit your statement" From SO chat
i usually go at the cinema instead of watching it here :P
movies that is
I only really go to the cinema if there's something really good I want to see
which is--damn rare
^^ that aswell
Time travel!
Wrek: not really, but that doesnt really matter to me
I'm not a big movie fan, so this setting is better for me
really really really
walking out on a cinema would just --mortify me
why?
loud?
to loud?
Because I'd be..interrupting peoples viewing, and appearing rude
are you 8 feet long?
Vivix: Do you sneeze uncontrollably?
Luckily not, that would be-- oh the end of my cinema days
Vivix: Oh come on, the critic is the best part of the flic!
Vivix: Cuz I can tell you when my mom and sister and I start laughing at something we think is funny, we get REALLY loud.
And we go tot the cinemas all the time
Hehehe
That's that's fine
I mean, I would feel really bad if I went to a movie, didn't like it, and walked out
05or you can do what me and a coulpe of friends did
Vivix: I can tell you from experience that nobody cares if you walk out. :P
05we went and saw the 3rd twilight movie in the cinema
Did a MST3K riff?
Vivix: Everybody has their reasons for walking out, not just because of bad movie
Wrek: you stood there booing?
05and we threw abcon chips on the girls in front of us each time they screeched
The only thing really bad is like- I saw Lord of the rings when it first came out, and a group of girls sat behind us going "EEEE" everythign Elijah Wood was on screen, and texting and playing on their phones rest of movie
lol
thats great
05halfway through they stopped
Yeah~~ I'd just feel bad, despite probably noone noticing
!
Why do I have a 6 minute long video at 1.56 GB.
O wrek
What part of turn off their phones do they not get?
Vivix: Yeah, you're supposed to turn your cell off during the movie. That's rude. :P
Wrek: :D
Yeah, that was a strange situation
I did actually see Twilight at the cinema
And whats so special about Elijah Wood?
Wrek: you did well.
and was--surprised that it wasn't horrible-
Wrek: Wait, what were you doing watching Twilight?
Wrek: I salute you for that.
SpadeMagnes[School]: it's the Eli in his name. makes him special
05afterwards we were blockign the exit makign fun of them by saying the standard stuff in a degradign tone
Vivix: I honestly haven't read or watched Twilight. I've heard too much bad press about it. =/
It isn't--great, that's for sure, and it is a bad love story
Wrek: I wish my friends were as fun to be around.
SpadeMagnes[School]: at least i get a ping everytime someone mentiones him
but- it's not really worse than any of the other teen movies I've seen-
Gold_Demona: Bella is too much of a sociopath to be enjoyed :|
She does look scarily unemotional
Bella is not a protaganist
like she's constantly on heroin-
Protaganists..DO SOMETHING
Hey, I liked Pants.
She was a... well, she was a character.
But honestly, it's not horrible, it's just- meh
Vivix: its just very overrated
I wasn't bored when watching it
And then 50 shades happened
yeah, that's the issue
At least it's great for Rifftrax :D
Vivix: Having watched quite a few of the newer Disney films, the live-action ones, I can agree on that.
Hehe
05no really
Yes really.
Orlyt
*Orly
05at once scene bella looks like an anorexic crackabuser
yarly
(She is)
She does look constantly tripping
05litterally
At least Bella died
she would be a good nancy in a sex pistols movie
05and we were all like "adn the girls liek this..."
Wrek: but it's so romaaaaantic~ :|
/me is a sucker for romance
buut-- it isn't really
05its tragic and you should feel ashamed
/me gags. "I'm fine, I'm fine."
Vivix: Ditto.
Why are girls attacted to that garbage?
I still read vampire books. I mean ACTUAL vampire books.
05van helsign is best vampire movie
Remember when vampires were cool...
SpadeMagnes[School]: Two names: Justin Bieber - One Direction
it's-- kinda a movie more about--being messed up, and kinda choosing between two people without really --showing any romance
abrahamlicon vs vamp?
05no wait
I kinda think vampires are stupid, like- all vampires
05abraham lincon the vampire hunter is best vamp movie
like Blades? Gaag-
05second best is ban helsing
Who the hell was on crack to come up with that abraham idea
05what a great idea it was
I find it awesome.
hi
05how do you think monthy python came up with their stuff? :P
05and also
05without drugs
05we'd have no pink floyd
:D
mmm~~
well, almost not true
Wrek: John Cleese calls it "the creative mode".
05think about that for a second
because of drugs we have no Syd Barrett
Wrek: As in, they'd just sit and throw out ideas. No ideas were bad.
because of drugs- most bands died and sucked
Wrek: Wasn't one of the Pythons a rabid alcoholic?
Yeah, the gay one
think how the guys came up with mario and his universe 2
He played Arthur in Holy Grail, right?
I don't think the others drank or did drugs- not sure
Think so-
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/9bd6c84030a7478110eb105797e4ec53.jpg Fluttershy does the shoo be doo
Seriously, John Cleese has a brilliant view on creativity.
05speaking of drugs
I must depart fellow bronies. It's lunch time!
The guy's a looney, but he's a damned good one.
Lunch!

hello everypony

Wish I could have it some more.
I've not tried any meads. I may have to. :3
good evening bronystate :)
Mead, had that one on Larpa once
DaringDerpy: Salve.
I found a holy handgrenade
05sjätte tunnan in stockholm is one of the few places that serve it
really--really sweet
05good one too
Shame it's such a 'dead' drink, that mead.
like flat?
No, dead. You don't see it a lot of places.
Oh right, yeah
I dunno why, on Larpa, most of the people make it themselves
Why are dead things always better?
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1abbd39432b4c38ec6b8189418164188.gif OH MY GOD. THIS IS THE BEST :D
Wait, that sounded better in my head.
it's not very strong- so they can do it unlicensed
Would you like some spam?
ask berrypunch
"Do you have anything without spam in it"
EGGS and SPAM
I have never had spam.
SpadeMagnes[School]: LOVELY SPAAAM WONDERFUL SPAAAAM
But that still has spam in it!
I always thouht spam was bogskinke, turns out it's not

Hmmmm, Green Eggs and Spam. They must be using the Dr. Seuss cookbook again

Hi :)
Hey MaxTheBrony!
Vivix: They actually do sell that sandwhich at Universal Studios...though the stand isn't open all the time. They color the eggs using powered spinach instead of food coloring
Oooh
That actually sounds delicious

08,01i wish i knew the songs better, because i want to sing them loudly
Heya GilDash :)
HIYA everypony
Bronysith: but you were already here
08,01hi MadSurge!
twilight_sprinkle: thats what you think
08,01Bronysith: i see a "hi" 3 minutes before the one you just gave
08,01methinks you were just trying to grab my attention :P
methinksitwaskira
08,01pfft, you always blame kira.
kira is overrated
08,01kira killed my goldfish
deathnote is overrated
13kira killed my childhood
indeed deathnote is
still decent
08,01the first half of deathnote is amazing
08,01and it should have ended there
deathnote was only not boring eps 9-25 or so
people need to understand that overrated=/= bad
08,01but noooo
08,01Bronysith: it should have nded when L did
08,01downer ending
08,01aye
im just sitting here, dancing to fukkireta
deathnote wasnt even that clever
Just as planned
it was a great idea with decent execution
I like lots of things that're overrated. :P
i thought of kiras plan 10 eps before he did, and nothing was preventing him from doing it the (spoilers) first time mica got captured
the main character is a dark one
not really a hero,
a dark main character isnt enough to make a good story
i never said that
08,01well, i enjoyed it
Gold_Demona: I like also underrated stuff :D
kira was quite empty too
08,01and i'm really clever
but i just think that the first half until L ended was a great little anime
08,01and popular
Snow: Deathnote
Hayo Snow
Hey Snow!
:o deathnote!
08,01snow!
AKA one of hte most overrated animes ever
deathnote actually did the "but he knows i know he knows" stuff
meh, i watched it, it was good
08,01twilight_sprinkle: like a teen romance novel
But lets take Gurren lagann, it was a simple idea with a spectacular execution and ended how it shouldve
08,01(still a better love story than twilight)
Overated isnt always a bad thing
code geass is MLG
SpadeMagnes[School]: nope
hi blako
also GITS
twilight_sprinkle: hell yeah CG was!
and the brilliantly over-the-top JOJO
Bronysith: very few actually
=_=
They both want to conquer
they both are highly intelligent
both have power to manipulate others
/me 08,01runs and hides from the anime
Gurren Lagann is just one of the best giant mech animes out there
Bronysith: kira didnt have an actualy power to manipulate, only to kill
twilight_sprinkle: he could manipulate
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Happily Ever After
twilight_sprinkle: nah
Bronysith: many characters are smart and can manipulate people
Bronysith: i just told you that theyre not similar..
and i explained why
curses!
Yawn
nwaY
i didnt like gurren lagann
everytime I make a commission the guy who asks me to draw him is never on xD
oh well
code geass is so boring
not really, you just gotta understand it
thats why code ment is incredibly hilarious, he took a boring anime and made it awesomely hilarious

Snow, gantz ^^
Twinkies!
Snow: ghost in the shell, if you enjoy thoughtful animes like code geass
thin crust is best pizza
Snow, but only if you like it psycho
Code Geass is incredibly overrated like death note
twilight_sprinkle: seen it already
SMACK ATTACK
stuffed crust is amazing ^_^
BladedWings: o god yes
pfft, code geass>gurren lagann any day
My pizza is for hardcore
twilight_sprinkle: exactly, overrated
ermagherd, lets destroy the universe with a light show!
Not that deep pan crap, This is freaking crater pan
Serenity: deep dish?

ive seen so far: Bleach, Naruto, code geass, death note, vampire knight, kuroshitsuji and lovely complex.
Snow: there is that gloriously over-the-top anime newdcd streamed, JOJO's bizarre adventures

ANIKI needs to get into chat fast
oh :(
Of the two choices of Presidents, I choose....
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
Eagle for president
It was freezing up this morning, thought it was gone for good
but its still alive :D
Twilight for prezident
Maybe Derpy
id rather have romney as president
NO
NO PRESIDENTS IN EQUESTRIA
WE DO NOT WANT A USA EQUESTRIA
uhm...
luna for president?
not equestria fucking hell
Obama as Princess?
id rather live in equestria
be a pony lol
DISCORD FOR PRESIDENT
hopefully it lasts a little bit longer
I will eat my hat is obama gets elected again
SpadeMagnes[School]: ill just move out of the country
Who the hell voted for him to begin with
SpadeMagnes[School]: hate to sound stereotypical but blacks and people afraid of being called racists
I mean what kind of people
Do like Sweden :P
Silly Sweden
A king with no power and a democracy Party selection
i want to move to scotland or something
I heard it was people who were lazy and just wanted to mooch of money
dont vote for any of them, vote discord
seriously.
did sweden vote discord president?
As one woman said it that amused me
Snow: Honestly... Discord would be better :D
i just want to move to somewhere in europe
Where'd you get the money? From Obama! Where'd obama get the money? From his stash!
lol what? :D
Some dumbass woman I forget what it was about said that
Hey everypony, nice to see the chat is flowing :P
Obama has money in his moustache
Money 'stash
...what moustache?
http://irishpony.tumblr.com/post/34060607734/this-is-why-im-voting-for-him SpadeMagnes[School] people like this dumbass
Snow: EXACTLY.
What do you call people who dont bother getting a job and just vote people so they can getz"benifits?
Bronysith: Wut
I dont even
RaveBrony: the person who commented on the photo said "this is why im voting for him"
And more recently, there's the whole "OBAMA PHONE" woman.
=_(\
RaveBrony: the fact that he said that makes me want to murder something
Where did discord get all that money from? his chocelate rain.
Also did you hear what happened to this one guy in college?
Bronysith: You and me both... damn todays society..
more reason for president
RaveBrony: and that is the reason why our country is so stupid
Why should you care Bronysith?
I agree
Do you think your opinions make people less rage-y?
Vivix: cause it is retards like that who vote for obama in the first place
A bunch of people beat the shit out of him because he had a romney sign in his lawn
seriously, choclate rain guys
CHOCLATE RAIN!
Who gives a fuck? It's the internet
He's ok though
I heard about that, too.
Vivix: cause it affects votes IRL and why a dumbass like obama gets elected in the first place
If aliens ever visit earth the first thing we have to do is HIDE THE INTERNET. We CANNOT let them see what's on there.
I doubt that person would vote any different even without that silly comment, and I even doubt he'll vote at all
Also why does the ads for elections seem like just a bunch of slander?
Vivix: well yea, hes like 13 thank god :D
So, why are you pissed?
now lets get out of this political discussion please
PLEASE
This isn't political, this is about judging other people
lets get out of this political shit before it gets out of hand
Something you do quite a lot
What?
No more political talk?
Ok
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeLrlmV9A-s
Here you go
PIZZA PIE

sorry BroHoof mis tab completed
05Vordox: enoguh that 1 glass is more than enough
Wrek: It's VERY powerful aye
taoumi: no worries :)
But the taste...
Not to spark a debate but the "possible" reason for only 13 episodes rubs me the wrong way
wb
taoumi: im getting great progress on my phoenix wright cosplay
Hey look a moose!
Wrek, I am currently hiding as well. also, that sounds great- Vordox made it sound delicious-
I need help....
taoumi: i found someone online who makes the wig
SpadeMagnes[School]: LOL You haven't seen [Spoiler1] with [Spoilre2] and nto to mention the fact that they [spoiler 3+4+5].
I'm really desperately in need of help
Vordox: ahh and dont forget [spoilerama]
Vivix: Ask wrek how it taste. :P
Pinkie Clones
The way the "reason" is worded bothers me
WREK: *teleprompter* How does it taste?
taoumi: phoenix wright of course
I will have to buy fanta and vanilla or something

Wrek: So...
taoumi: do you see that?
Wrek: Sex is bad so that means the drink is bad? :P
http://onceuponapony.tumblr.com/
yeah it looks good Bronysith . somethimes they make it more clumpy but this one looks preaty good
taoumi: thats probably gonna be the most expensive part of the costume, i hope it isnt too much :D
does bronyfunds exist anymore?
FOR EVERY PRE BRONY
Just how much does a company make from tv show reruns?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn7UWRERTdE
HERE
SpadeMagnes[School]: It's hub own so...
SpadeMagnes[School]: Nothing?
its $$$$ saved from not having to spend $$$ to make a new episde
I still cant rap my head around the logic for the supposed reason
it makes perfect sense.
SpadeMagnes[School]: There's another spoiler I do not want to say here. :P
From a buisness standpoint
I just wish they would be consistent with the start of a season
s1- Oct s2- Sept s3- Nov
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBZPPsX6CHI allofmywhat.
Lets hope when season 3 is done the gap wont be too big
inconsistent start dates is a part of tv world
SpadeMagnes[School], we live in hope~

A long time fan for her, and her voice is like Fanta and Vanilla Ice cream

i come back after getting some hot glue on my hand and i read: 4chan is a great site...dafuuu?
Snow: well it is
Socks: As I said, play the game
Then go play the old ones
Come back when you have a REAL opinion?
what game?
is resident evil 2 pretty good?
RE6, then go play RE1 or RE2
Alchemist dunno, it's 4 goddamn Euros xD it's Dürrenmats "The Physicians" or however you spell that
Bronysith: For it's time it was good, yes
And now... Yeah it still holds up, aged as heck though
Yeah, I wont speak here >.>
Vordox: would i enjoy it if i bought it and played today?
Bronysith: No
/me is very opinionated with video games
Pondoo, you shall speak~
Bronysith: Well, depends. :P
Bronysith: Why do you play games?
Vordox: for fun
stories
Bronysith: For you, what is fun?
/me tries to find out what you are talking about
Bronysith: YOu would hate old games then...
Vordox: good story is a great help
Most old games do not have a story, or very thin
Lil_B: havent heard about it.
Vordox: story, good gameplay,
<.<
Vordox: i just like games man
Vordox: old games aren't fun?
... I'm currently getting the RE6 Music Gamerip, (7 CDs worth of music xD) the Main Theme sounds like really good orchestra
DaringDerpy: Never said they were fun, talking about narrative. :P
old games are fun, but many have slim to no stories, just like Indie games
My computer's download speed for my wow is slow
Its going like 1.14-1.49 MB a second
SpadeMagnes[School], its all those pandas you are downloading?
Vordox: as long as it is fun, as in is it playable?
Had to reinstall the whole thing
aww
PONDOOOO
Vordox: challenging?
yes Jmo?
Lefry chicken
i warb u
Vivix, DaringDerpy, Bronysith: You can't say fun, and old games can be fun, but it's narrative(The story handling) is based on challenge. :P
Alchemist isn' t that famous, but it's an optional book to user in school and most people wanted it (the other choices weren't that good)
^^ spluff you too Jmo
Look at Castlevania 1 or 2, what's the story(Not from Manual, but from the game)
I agree with you
What a terrible night to have a curse
dawwifeelspeshul:>
Vordox: is the combat and gameplay controls okay?
Vordox: I understand. What do you think about no-rules, no-directions, no-story sandbox games?
SpadeMagnes[School]: :D YES dat Castlevania 2
Bronysith: No, it's very stiff, and hard, And will make you cuss due to the how the mechanics are put into the dynamic, which gives off the aestehtics of it being chalenging.
DaringDerpy: They are emergant Stories, or Story machines.
Lil_B: Im reading it's synopsis on the wiki right now, but I have a hard time reading any book that is not a sci-fi or an educational book :D
hm... the normal people that I talk to arent on... guess I'll do some homework while I wait for my ride ^^
Dwarf fortress best game ever
/me is back
Vordox: ahh okay. I like old games, like NES and SNES games
Alchemist me too >.<
/me boops ASoftFluffyThing
/me pets ASoftFluffyThing|AFK
Anythin' streamin'?
Bronysith: Then you like games for their challenging aspect?
ASoftFluffyThing \:3/ im streaming!
Vordox: yes
Play kaizo mario them
/me turns into a pillow for Jmo and Panda-
Bronysith: Then why did you talk about stories before? :P
Huzzah.
*then
Vordox: cause i like a good story too :D
Bronysith: basically you have to use the option weapons to compensate for the clumsiness of the character, just like Konami wanted
Panda U be streamn?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pre-Reader Q&Neigh Numero Cuattro
DaringDerpy: That' a heavy adventure game textual game, that has TONS of narrative forms to fill in the story in the game with the same mechanics that been used for several eras.
Lil_B not really ^^ not right now at least.
Bronysith: Then you played mostly JRPG and RPGs?
yay~
many games you would never had expected it from had awesome storylines....project nomad is nice for example
Vordox: yes, also castlevania on the NES, Contra,
Bronysith: Contra had a story?
Vordox: you sound like a textbook
SUDDENLY ALIENS
Voice acting isnt really necessisary for a good story
That Derp Roll'd.
Vordox: no, lol, i just like the challenge
<--- Game Design student atm, DaringDerpy :P
that explains it
Vordox: but seriously, is resident evil 2 challenging?
I'm trying to learn to understand
It's HARD.
LETS DO IT
Bronysith: Hmmm, some parts, luckily.
play them, take the generalizations with a grain of sal
Jill sandwich
t
Bronysith: Othewise...no
Vordox: and how about storywise? nothing?
BUT if you want a REAL good sstory(Narrative + Voice acting) go for RE1
Vordox: yes, aliens invade disguised as terrorists, government sends in Rambo and the AHNOLD to kill them all :D
Vordox: ahh okay
Bronysith: It's heavy on the story. :P
/me lays on ASoftFluffyThing
MadSurge: *Facepalm nowadays, but back then it was FRICKING ROCKING*
Try beating contra with no continues...
fluffeh pilloow
Hell I dare you to beat contra with dieing!
At the moment, I'm studying Narrative forms of the games...
And looking back, HOLY SHIT the NES was masterpieces(The Good mouth to mouth games)
/me messes up Jmo's mane
Vordox: eh, if the game is good, I'm willing to ignore a bad story or a few stupid mechanics
Like...take for example the game... Talespin. :P
huzzah~
Vordox play Illusion of Gaia/Time and Terranigma
messy mane.
Vordox: i love challenging games
Im sure you enjoy Kaizo mario then
Lil_B: I want to play Terranigma. :( The other one I haven't heard.
Bronysith: You want new age Challenge games: Super MEat Boy, Dark Souls/Demon's soul.
Vordox: have you played chrono trigger perhaps? i mean thats more story than challenging
Vordox: already beat demons souls
Try IWBTG
Vordox: for my taste, the nes was to restrictive...everything was full of invisible walls and level balancing. you had to follow one line and only this one line
Vordox: but i want to get into retro games
HOHOHOHO
Dark Souls
So fun.
Jmo: /)
If you want story, for funsies: Hector, Puzzle Agent(FREE), if you want serious, go or Telltale other games: Walking Dead(The game) or Braid/Bastion. :P
I like serious games-
DaringDerpy: What...?
not fan of gameplay for the sake of gameplay games
y so srs Vivix.
DaringDerpy: You missed out on Semi Dynamic games then. :(
Y SO SRS
Poyo
Vordox: so resident evil 2 is more hard than anything else?
semi dynamic
cuuz gaames are fuuun
DaringDerpy: There's plenty of Modular/Semi Dynamic games even back in NES:
/me does the Kirby Dance
Vordox well, ok, do this , Play Soul Blazer, then Illusion of Time (trhat's the european Title) and then Terranigma (all SNES games) , they don't directlky have something to do with each other, but they are spiritual successors to oneanother
never had an nes...didn't like the showcase games, didn't try the underdogs
Vordox: it's part of a trilogy, Soul Blazer (who was a spiritual sequel to Actraiser), Illusion of Gaia, and Terranigma. Similar themes, diferent characters
MadSurge: <.< I played Actraiser. D:
Well if I ever get time...
Action 64.....
The thing is, Game Designers are supposed to actually SEE behind the game when playing
Vordox: they're more action-based though
Ruin games for myself sometimes. ._.
So you study the design of the experience?
Vordox: what kind of games are you going to make man? good and challenging i hope
We need more people like that
Vivix: Basically, yes.
The Experience = Aethetics.
Vordox although Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia may have some... Game mechanics one may not like, they are good games, and I completly Adore Illusion of Time for it'sm story and generall Atmosphere threwout the game
Creating the game to make the player simulate THIS experience
That's great, I hope next gen devs will be very focused on that- experience and feel
Up Up Down Down
Where THIS is where the game goes around
yes
i play contra
without the code
Lil_B: If I ever get the chance. :(
My current favourite game devs are the Overwatch team
Vivix: Hardly...
Can you beat it with out game overs?
Aww~~
Vivix: Well, there's been one thing you forgot.
Hm?
Vivix: The more players play games, the more arrogant they become.
Just look at me. :P
Vordox do it when you have spare Time xD, I think yoiu are smart enough to work with Emulators xD
Hehehe
That's true
no one produces challenging mainstream games anymore...these streamlined faggots don't wear ties at presentations, because it could alienate the target audience....how could they make a challenging game
"I don't like this mechanics, I do not like this menu, I do not like this system" etc etc.
I play alot of game and I an not arrogant
It's true, but the mechanics is one thing
"What if they change this here to this here?"
Vivix: No, that's the fun part. :)
I think- most indie games try to change mechanics to a point where they are just a bunch of tech demos-
Insert Tv tropes"They changed it now it sucks"
There's a system game designer use, Called MDA, Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics.
what changed
mechacnis are important, but sometimes- they really do change something that maybe shouldn't have been changed. in other cases- like walking dead game, it can create a cool new feeling
i think most mainstream game designers are making games too easy
All are intertwined(If a game is created correctly), so there's never "This one here"
true-
Of course... we have the famous "Flow breaker"...
I admire gamedevs- but it's not a profession for me
And sometimes its the same now its sucks
Like for example, if you played RE6, you sometimes have cutscenes or scripted events.
Fanbases are too finicky
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT with a zombies
diidn't play, but yeah
Out of all the games, RE6 o.o
yeah breaks the flow or --situation, so to speak
It's like "OH FUCK OH FUCK, I WILL KILL YOU A*Scene starts* Oh I got to wait..............*OKAY I AM BAC WTF THEY HIT ME DURING THE CUTSCENE; FUUUUDGE"*
Mood whiplash!
Why, oh why
I prefer games like- okay, dishonored and valve, almost no-- breaks from the movements, it feels solid
Am I always so slow.
of course, that's- yeah a preference
Vivix: Hub?
Cause you're in the matrix.
Vivix: Heard plenty of bad things about the Hub. :P
the hub?
Vivix: How it breaks the flow, but I haven't played it yet
I just traded with a fellow brony on TF2 and found out about the season 3 premiere.
Where you choose, basically, the World.
ohh
Oh boy that is slow.
Welcome then Floris. :D
in Dishonored? Well- it's kinda like a broken eh "select mission" thing
Oh...
Some one clearly doesnt browse EQD
Vivix: Those are dangerous to use. :P
but--it works well enough
[20:38:02] Floris Kunst: and the reemergence of a certain unnamed fan favorite villain
yeah, but--it works better as a non select mission, and just as a resting point to get the narrative in
Vivix: Suprisingly, you're a sponge for opinions and knowledge...
Interesting...
You know about it, and you can communicate about it...
COmpared to me. :D
I thought this villian thing was just a rumour
Mah sponge.
Hehe, I tend to like snapping up things and analyzing them on the fly
Vivix: Try to pick down a game
/me squeezes Vivix
What works, what does not.
sometimes that makes me say really uneducated guesses, but- just how it is
Hmm-
/me cuddles Jmo
Vivix: Take your favourite game.
I really should play Skyward sword again...
Hello Kitty Online.
...
Lol Jmo
:>
You serious...?
lolno
Okay- that's a hard one, probably lets say half life universe now
Thank Celestia. :D
Played that shit for 5 minutes and cried after.
Vivix: Ah no, only one game, not the whole franchise. :P
but I recently played Dishonored- so picking down that would be easier
Ok, take Dishonoured
(Spoiler free as well)
Okay yeah-
I have not played the game, so let's begin with one thing...
What feelings did you get?
What did the game "Give" for Experience?
Are you charging per hour for this?
Beauty, and art. More so than a captivating story
What is this therapy?
Steampunk world, with robots?
I'm currently play Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, I hope it has a hrad mode later
hard*
Remember the old games that had the whole narrative stuff in one "xy-pedia" and in item and tech descriptions? xcom, civilization, alpha centauri? it was more than enough to keep one playing.
True, a new world, new experience and sights = Exploration and Mystifications.
Kinda- it's more like, eh 1700s france with magic and steampunk, whith a strange mix of tech
but I have to turn the Grafics down or I have to play the game in Slo Mo :P#
Vivix: Sounds good.
But still apply to what I said.
It gave you a new world to explore with "new" things, that you may wonder how they work.
yes, it feels very fresh, and beautiful. And the way the controls feel, solid and to the point, even the ledge mechanics, make the world feel solid and open, despite being linear
Is it normal for me when I have a strategy guide to a new game I ignore the guide and figure things out my self and read it later?
yes
Vivix: Wait, how is the controlls different compared to any other FPS?
New experiences, sights, and lore
They're not, really, but it's a UDK game, that for me personally, tend to feel distant to details, and it felt more like a source game with a closeness to details. Adding few playerclips and many alternate reutes make the world feel solid, open, yet linear
they deliver you the strategy guide ingame now. forced tutorial, forced hints, etc
Alright, so it's a Semi Dynamic choice
yeah, and the details felt up close, rather than "view only"
You have 2+ routes to go through the game, but you still go together once again later on back into the story
Not every game...
There's 4 Narrative story routes.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/54571eb93355d01a0490f0601cb769d6.jpg Not enough Pinkie, but CLOSE ENOUGH <3
Modular(Hubs, Stage select etc), Linear, Semi Dynamic and fyll Dynamic.
I dont mind tutorials but all the incentive I need is gear and objective, go do
And a special narrative, called a Story Machine(SIMS, MInecraft etc)
Yeah,
All right, I'm going to take off.
So I assume it's a modular Hybrid with Semi Dynamic routes...
Everlasting_Joy: later bro
Sounds good enough.
kind of, the modular is-- kind of down, you know? I don't think its a good feature
O.o
the HUB is--a resting point between "missions"
to catch up on the main storyline, and--upgrade, rest, relax
How does it feel "off?"
when you've completed the game, you can select missions in the main menu, but rather than work like--a hub, it's like a savegame on each chapter
Somehinglike Catherine?
so it feels like an intended hub, without acting as a mission select, as it is also part of the main storyline
Hey listin
*listen
Never played Catherine- but maybe
Okay, like Megaman? :P
/me suplexes SpadeMagnes[School]
<,< never played that either-
>_>
Take this mission/stage, complete, back to Stage Select.
Super Mario Bros...?
<,<
Oh
god
Just
REALLY?
I was not a nintendo kid <,<
but no eh--
Okay, okay....
I will beat you with soap.
Hmm. Like Donkey Kong?
Vordox how High did you get?
Vivix: I liked Catherine :D
Lil_B: On what? :P
Vordox the building of course
Vivix: How about Little Big Planet?
Hehe, I think it's a mission hub in the game's storyline, but not in the game mechanics. That makes me feel like I expect to be able to start there and pick what missions I'd like, but I can't
Lil_B: What building? O.o
You got Rush Jet!
I have played LBP, but long time ago-
Vivix: Oooh
I see what you mean.
Vordox Donkey Kong... think good and think long about it
Lil_B: I complete all of them. :P
SpadeMagnes[School]: lol Megaman 2?
Vivix: So it's basicaclly just arest place, with only ONE route to go after being there?
MadSurge, I never tried it, but I thin kwe talked about it a long time ago here?
evening paizanos
Vordox I'm taslking about the Arcade Donkey Kong... !
Lil_B: Oh god... I don't remember. :P
Oh Bubble man you suck
Lil_B: Same as I do not remember Bubble Bobble
yeah, basically. You have the option to upgrade, or mess around in that area, but you have to go wiht the linear story
Vivix: yep
Vivix: Odd choice..
Vordox dude, I'm 20, I'm younger than you!
Vivix: Like being full freedom but then ravaged of it, and then you're forced into a smaller area.
is there no stream yet?
yeah- it kinda makes sense for the story, but--it did feel odd when combined with the mission select in the main menu
Lil_B: So? XD
I think you guys might be looking too deep into it
Vivix: Basically, you wanted the same feature as the main menu but in your hub?
Odd change.
Kinda, I wanted to replay missions with different loadouts, jsut to have fun
so what are ya talking bout?
but instead it loads a save with what I st arted with at that mission start
Vordox I think I lost the Point I was going to make somewhere on the way, stay tunes while I'm twatching for it
Sounds greedy. :P
Hehe
saty tuned*
Lil_B: Will wait.
:p
Vivix: That's the thing...
... JonTrons NightShade "Review" ended... unexpected
But yeah, I think it comes down to the hub not being a mechanic hub, but a story-point and rest area for a certain part of the game
Vivix: What happens in the hub?
Anything related to the story(Random NPC talk etc)
yeah, it's--closure on the mission, narrative and what happens next, optional upgrade of equipment, talk to minor npcs, and get set up for the next mission
So it's not a static room, eh...
Hmmm.
What makes it feel odd if it has a purpose for the story?
it acts as your--bedroom, you sleep between missions- it gives a sense... of belonging I guess
Sketch_Toku_Brony d'aww
Vivix: Is the Hub your home?
Vivix: Like litterally?
Oh for the love of god....
eh- kind of, can't say too much without spoilers on that
but it acts as one yes
I think the reason it felt odd, is because it can be reminiscent of other games with a more stage select hub, which makes you expect certain thigns that don't happen
Vivix: And that's the thing I always get back to :P
Vivix: Arrogance, and spoiiled.
I can't go into the other part without spoilering-
Yeah
I know, I understand what you mean
and now sad de lancie
Once you get used to something, or fond of something, you generally want more of it
:(
Thing is- I'm not especially fond of mission select, but it reminded me of mission select
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Let's Find You a Date! (Update Complete!)
I wish there was a stream :(
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates October 24th (Afternoon)
got the ANNO 2070 Add-On , ANNO Add-ones are some of the rare add ons that actually give you enough new contend for the additional prize
two links in a few seconds? boy they work fast
Vivix: Bad habit there...
The more you get stuck on "easy" quirks..
The less you appreciate the games
wow, that season finale
fuck
Even if they are good or bad.
Well, I loved the game
Are you two seriously still on that?
but it's a thing that as a designer, one usually watches out for
holy fuck
BBL everypony, going to guild
ciao
Heya everypone ;)
laters, enjoy youself
yo Sonny
Nittany here ye-
mmmh
guess he's not...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH8mQRXemuo Needs more mario
Vivix: We can't add everything to each game. :ÖP
Nono, of course not
Vivix: That's what the indie market is trying to do as well.
Trying to pull the mechanics away from the mainstream gaming.
Anyway.....
See it as EA is your nice uncle giving you all you got, but your father pulling your money so you can't get the fun games anyway. :D
I'm not sure if my point came across, it's nothing wrong with the design there, it's a very enjoyable game, but things are pointed out for the sake of discussion
okay, bad analogy
Hehehe
Vivix: Discussion is always fun
Trying to use EA in a good anology the fuck?
NEEEERDS
Yeah, analyzing or--whatevering
:?>
SpadeMagnes[School]: EA isn't bad.
Well, game wise...
Right....
COmpany wise however... >.>
Well I do not know the full facts.
They're loosing money, so they need to make money
So- that makes consumers angry
Vivix: *Looks at Modern Warfare and Star Wars* What you talking about?
I think someone pointed ou their netloss
No its the way they pull bullshit is what makes cosumers angry
Highest Selling game of all time. :P
productions costs and maintenance costs overgoing the income of their games
Again ME3 for example
I didn't like ME2
inking luna's coat is hard. she's so dark
so never tried ME3
SpadeMagnes[School]: What's wrong with ME3?
The ending majorly
the ending Vordox
Seriously? This again?
lololol
I love when this pops up.
Okay, I'll make it short
11,02Morning everypony :)
The original ending was sparse, to give players freedom of thought
HOWEVER
Hi NewSuperBronyU~
good evening NewSuperBronyU :)
People were too narrow minded and concieved the ending as "lackluster" as the creators of the game was too "nice" to the players. :P
I didn't see the ending
Bullshit
Vivix: I've checked into it.
But- I got it reiterated, was it that bad?
It's not bullshit SpadeMagnes[School] .
Vivix: It's not bad, just very...
The ending dont change a damn thing except for the color at the end
Well, you remember the ending of FFVII?
:O man S3 looks like its gonna be awesome~
SpadeMagnes[School]: Wrong. :P
Sometimes endings are just that, and ending
an*
inb4 he hasn't played FFVII
Well people want closure to those kinds of games
Be nice Jmo . :
:P
<.<
I thought ME1 ending was horribly cheesy, still liked the game
Neva.
SpadeMagnes[School]: That is true.
SpadeMagnes[School]: But if you want an open closure, it's a choice they made.
Vivix is a gaming newbie. D:
;D
/me slaps Vivix with soap
Jmo: So? He still has a brain in his head. :P
Hehehe
I respect that, gaming experience whatnot
There is no brain there. Tis a lie.
/me hugs Jmo
but Vordox ff7 did present you with a choice pretending that it would change something then not change a damn thing. all it did was .... this happend
didn't*
My brain was lost to ponies and goaticorns
taoumi: Really? The ending with Midgar?
Frekin Goaticorns.
It ended EXACTLY the same as ME3. :P
but "this ahpepned" Is that a bad ending?
Yet I do NOT hear a single bad mouthing FFVII.
it's a common ending in books and stories- "This happened, and it changed nothing"
Which makes me just sick that people complained.
Vivix: Correct.
Sometimes- that's really cool
HOWEVER Vivix ...
What also bothers me is there is no everyone survives ending
yeah. it riped apart midgar. but saved the planet. Vordox . and advent chidren cleaned that up nicely
There was ONE thing that pissed everyone off..
/me disclaimer: did not play ME3
Vordox what are you studying again? you have been talkinmg and kinda lacturing about Video Games for at least 20 solid minutes :P
It was the goat.
SpadeMagnes[School]: What...? Go play it again, NOW
mm?
Everyone in the fucking galaxy dies one way or the other
Lil_B: Game Design student and studying...well...What makes good games. :D
08,01bleh
08,01tired
08,01hi hvordox
Vivix: As I said, there was ONE thing that made people anry
08,01that's because i don't sleep sensibly
So very anry.
Vivix: It was promised by the creators of the game that they had 3 varying story endings.
Vivix: With very distinct difference.
I like endings where I feel good about my choices
Ooh... was, that where they split them off?
it was quite distint. it have 3 very dofrent colors
Vivix: First original ending did not have that, they had 3 change per ending, but none of them were "big"...(Which is ironic, depending on what happened exactly to Shephard)
08,01hey Lil_B!
08,01Dken2021: i wore it on my bum
08,01and sat on my face
08,01it was horrible
XD
o.O
Vivix: So yeah, Shephard has 3 choices, and each one does omethingto Shephard, HOWEVER.
SpadeMagnes[School], look at fallout endings, your actions kinda change nothing, you just.. in fallout1 you even get kicked out and forced to leave
Hm?
Vivix: There was a HUGE war effort(See it as Quests) that would change the ending... it didn't.
Again either you kill them all via molecular vaporasation or something, turning them into cyborgs, or just blowing the galaxy up
SpadeMagnes[School]: ...spoiler.
/me gives a hard slap on top of SpadeMagnes[School] 's head.
LOL
pwnd
Hehehe
Spoilers4lyf
okay, so the quests was not affecting the ending at all, but your last choice did?
SpadeMagnes[School]: And funnily.. 2 of the endings you said are wrong. :P
I want a god damn endign where everyone doesnt fucking die
Vivix: Yes, hard choice ending.
Ah-
SpadeMagnes[School]: There as ONLY One choice that killed off everyone. :P
In the extended ending atleast.
Im pretty sure the other two choices were just as bad
SpadeMagnes[School]: Wrong, one of them gives hope, the other 2 just "Wowss" you in the extended ending.
HOWEVER; Let's get back to Original ending.
There was 3 choices there, where Shephard ... gets something from the story.
And they are REALLY different.
You know what i mean SpadeMagnes[School] :P
How do I explain this without spoilers...
/me slaps Vordox
Okay- hm
BE A MAN
Hehe
Vordox: Look a moose!
O Jmo, don't make my goaticorns touch you
Like a raging fire?
Oh god no
Swift as a coursing river?
SpadeMagnes[School]: There WAS 3 differences for each ending...
I will murder them with my bare hands.
!
1 of them is BIG, the other 2 are DAMN.
I will cry, for ever
Like I care :P
;__;
You already cry enough to me.
DAMNIT; is it okay if I spoil the original endings, chat?
/me holds and cries
I don't mind
when forced to tell spoilers, say Look a moose!
I wouldn't care.
130938?
<!DOCTYPE spoilers>
Okay, spoilers incoming(Original atleast)
I'm bored but I don't feel like doing anything
Vordox: I don't really care about Mass Effect. Go on
SpadeMagnes[School]: There was 3 ways Shephard could die. :P
Yeah, I've seen one on a joke site
Hi everypony :(
Explosions, Vaporization, or Inoculated.
:)*
ello thelonepony
Which way would you go?
None of those ways
For most people, thisis just "graphics", Vivix .
I'd be a total asshole, ad cut to black, cause you died. And the art lover in me would love that
but--closure
Vivix: It was a closure, you died in any of the choices.
Okay, so at the end you get to choose those three things, no matter what earlie choice?
Vivix: Yes.
Why cant we have a endign where we dont die
i would take the James Kirk way out, there is no such thing as a no-win scenario :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: There is
Oh I mean, closure based on my last decision, I would kinda like it if you never knew the results of your action
A seond, Vivix, Let me link you to the original 3 endings.
Ohkay
That gives you a better view on what I will try and convey
And you take a peek at it too SpadeMagnes[School] :P
Vordox: shame you get railroaded on the same 3 endings regardless of what you did
Thats one thing that annoys me all your choices in the last two games mean nothing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmXGAtjv5aQ <--. Original endings
MadSurge: Why is that shame?
You're going to hell Vordox.
You spoiler.
:<
/me watches
ow so you guys where talking about mass effect...
MadSurge: Sure, it's NOT what was promised, but I think I see how it was originally thought
I always played as a woman in games like that
hmm spoilers...
thelonepony: No. :P
im going for the moose.
It's ONLY spoilers if you CLICK the link
Ahahaha you woman.
I Knew That >_>
You made me click the link.
*walks to the moose*
Vordox: because I'd like to have an ending based on what I did. I want to drag to hell the universe, not some nobody with mechasquids :D
MadSurge: What was your original choice?
Vordox: Infamous 2 did a pretty good job at that
Whats the point of makeing moral decisions in a trilogy when they mean nothing in the end?
fully dynamic endings are difficult, fallout uses flags to chop it into parts, not 100% accurate
Vordox: nothing, I just read stuff online :P
i hate my life
SpadeMagnes[School]: I can agree with that.
MadSurge: Oh. :P
why kidzrul434 :(
I just came home from school and what's the point?
School is a waste of time
kidzrul434 you live to see another day
SpadeMagnes[School]: Was the child at the end only shown if you did all side quests?
talk with us? :3
Oh boy another school complainer.
kidzrul434 plus school helps you get jobs surprisingly
Vordox: did you play Infamous?
What's the point? You're just going to forget about everything
MadSurge: Nope. :P
kidzrul434: Really?
kidzrul434: I MISS School.
School
I miss it too
Why you think I go in university atm. :
:P
Vordox: it's a pretty good sandbox series
yea, I miss the social aspect of schools
MadSurge: I know, heard and seen gameplay of it.
Cuz yer a nerd verdex.
:>
I miss learning and assignemnts too
that and goaticorns
Oh god you will burn Vivix.
;D
Vordox: and the second game carries over bonuses if you did the previous game's endings
Nothing gamebreaking, mind you
You know what I like? Cyoa-
Cyoa?
Vivix: Keep watching :P
Try to skip to where you have a choice
I don't know what game has my favourite ending- I don't --know
Vivix: That's where the hard choice is
ah yes
I'm watching it at the moment
My favourite ending? Nier Ending D
Best ending EVER
CYOA is Choose your own adventure
You want a closure, THAT is a closure, SpadeMagnes[School] :p
Lawl
I spent most of music college playing CYOA games, loved them, so much
ah
Vordox: :$ agreed
MadSurge: Played Nier? :P
Vordox: yesh
MadSurge: Props to you for finding the under the radar game.
MadSurge: Do not spoil it for the others. :P It's a thing you have to live through, not read or spoil yourself if interested.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Spadey? You there?
What kind of game is that?
Vordox: I was in britain and I got that, Infamous 2 and Henry Hatsworth for the DS
I've wanted to look at Nier but it's banned in Aussie.
QQ
Vivix: What is Nier... Where to begin..
Jmo: I can link you a REALLY good LP of it
Vivix: Third Person Touhou with Easy DMC controlls?
Jmo: screenshots though
MadSurge: You spoiling the game? ;_; IMPORT it Jmo !
I mean on digital distrubtion.
If you can play PAL or NTSC. :P
I could get it physically easily.
but I love my digital >_>
Jmo: It's not on PC I think
distribution*
Oh so it isn't, the hell?
Vordox: I want to play Drakengard too, no matter how bad it is :D Cavia are the best trolls
Nier looks strange whenever I look at it, but the music is so damn sweet <3
Thought it was. ;______;
MadSurge: I missed that series as well...
Oh Dark Id's Lp is hilarious
Ooh, Free weekend of Left 4 Dead 2 starts tomorrow. I'm preloading
Lil_B: Give the game a play... litterally. :P
Cbf getting a console again. Eh
Lil_B: Yes, the music is awesome :3
Drakengard!
Tohou...
oh god I'm so far out on the gaming scene
what the hell is that
did anyone say Touhou?
Vivix: Bullethell game
Vordox I play PC and Nintendo, now way for me to get it :P
ahh--
it's like bullet hell with an all girl cast
Lil_B: ._. dang
Touhou!
ah- probably not for me then
Vivix: NONO
God damn it these new glasses suck
i enjoy the *** outa that game
Vivix: Don't get me wrong, it's not super hard. :P
Vordox: that game is off-the-wall insane in the story department. Especially ending D and E
SpadeMagnes[School]: I asked you before Spades.
Hehe, but it's more challenge based than...
05(if you're a watcher of my da than you might wanna read the latest note there...)
SpadeMagnes[School]: If you got all the sidequests done, you saw the child at the end, or was that auto?
you know?
I have no idea
Vivix the fandom has made other genres like mario or castlevania mixed with touhou
Dat art stream.
Vivix: It's not a hard game. :P
Vivix: If you like story, PLAY IT
okay-
Vivix: DOne iwth the 3 endings?
Wrek dat Livestream...
I love stories, that's about the main reason I play
not yet, firsto ne now I think-
Wrek: why not streaming art here :(
Wrek but clever way to go around the advertisement rule
Vivix: you can fast forward once that's done, you'l see the small changes.
MadSurge: So MadSurge ...
MadSurge: How many times you cried? :P
/me does so
Vordox: not once, but sad yes :(
Tohou is sad?
Vivix: Nier is sad
ohh
Vivix: No Nier is.
I like sad-
lurve it
MadSurge: You remember 2:e playthrough
OH MY GOD
My mom and dad say to worry about school work and we'll get it done, meanwhile I have 3 quizes in Pre calculus to do a lab,a quiz and a 2 part unit test to do
... I wanna fix my Majoras Mask Remix, but I think I'll have to rework the big Clockwork sounds :/
LIKE ARE YOU F*CKIGN SERIOUS feeling
*not
I kinda like feeling like I'm reading a book, BUT, I also like just--playing a game
Vivix: Then get Nier :P if you have an Xbox or PS3
Vordox: I was kinda suspicious... saw it coming :D
damn...
I don't
MadSurge: Even the wolf...?
Can I play Nier on my NES?
i wna pway it on da nes
SpadeMagnes[School] don't you just love parents that think that way?
Jmo: Sadly no XD
;__;
Sigh..its two thirty and I still havent gotten anything done
Not even the C64?
Stoopid game.
Vordox: I didn't saw the secret documents twist coming :D
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
My dad being off a week and working a week is goign to fuck up my school scedual
omai.
okay now I've seen the endings
Vivix: And you saw the 3 changes right?
Name them ontop of your head if you can
I think so yeah
You can join in too SpaceTransitPony
SpadeMagnes[School]: *
ROfl
/me sits on Panda|Homework
so hard question-
Nuuu
Vivix: Not really. :P
Shephard's Death, Repear's changes, and Colour
colours..-
yeah
but--
that's it?
I swear you guys are the only thing keeping me from going fucking insane with all this school bullshit
Yes, that is it. Rest is the same.
Vivix: YEP
anyone here taken the class "Research Methods"?
<--
SpadeMagnes[School]: If you need help, ask.
Nope.
Vivix: But that's the thing...
I can't research anything for shit. XD
One method, to rule them all.
Hello GilDash! :$
That's the endings, what do you think of them Vivix ?
Praise Google.
Oh, and holla all again. :)
/me hugs GilDash
I dunno- honeslty, I don't know
Hai GilDash
Jmo, not schoolarly enough >.>
Pffft
The only course I dont fucking hate is my 3d art class
mainly because, I don't have any loose ends to tie up, or emotion invested in the game
Screw your school.
they just feel like three different endings with little meaning to me
Vivix: That's the thing.... For most, it was "Too little" too late in the game.
they are--crazy similar though
ah-
Google is good. Can always give you ideas for other things to research.
I can imagine it being so, but as I haven't playedi t, yeah
Vivix: the fans got REALLY angry at them
According to most opinions atleast.
ohai GilDash
Google is Satan.
Vivix: But honestly... If you die, that's a closure, isn't it? XD
Depends-
Obviously papers and books are your best resource, but if you don't know what to look for that'll be a problem.
BUt people want to SeE what happend AFTEr you death.
closure is when your questsions feel answered and complete
Juxtapose much, gamerS?
buuut
I kinda like the idea of you dying
and never knowing the rsult
result*
Vordox: which Nier level's theme was the best for you? :)
I wish my courses were easy enough to figure out on my own
NeEdS mOrE CaPs
Vivix: Same.
woops
<.<
MadSurge: Hmmm... I like the Shadowlord one... or Mechadump
I can hardly understand most of the shit I'm supposed to be learning in Pre Calc
some of my favourite games, and favourite books, have endings that are really vague or open
Vivix: Same here, I've been near death once in a mile. :P I agree with you
Vivix: But as people said, they spent 100+ hours in this game franchise...
And they wanted still more.
true- I can see... why I guess
For such an ending, choosing your death...
but it's more the why because of the promising
Vordox: YESH :$ I love The Wretched Automatons!
And that little change(Little as in visual, NOT in thought)
if there had been no promises, would people complain?
Well if your gonna make so many moral choices and have it not pay off...
Vivix: Most likely.
Hm..
Needs more V.
SpadeMagnes[School]: You hated the original endings....
Oh I love you both. Like a resemblence of V Energy Drink.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Why? Cause of so small difference?
SpadeMagnes[School]: And not being paid of for what you did in the game, (War effort etc)
I think, maybe, if the moral choice was not visible, it would go down better
That and the fact no matter what choices you make you still have the same three endings
I see 3 tottally different endings really.
Time to roll out.
BUT I see it not from the game, but from myself.
I think one of the best moral grey ever designed was Fallout Van Buren, and it was never even completed
Oh Vooooordox~ http://i.imgur.com/OGZqb.png
I see one ending, where they all work together to live, this has some BIG changes for everyone.
I see one ending, where Reaper as killed out, and the rest survivors have to survive based on this, Krollians or whatever they were called had to try and live with the one that control them etc et, It'll be freedom choice.
The last ending, is where they just... go off.
That's... not much that difference really XD
Vordox: too bad it's all implied :I
but if it weren't
it would be like to the moon
To the moon was GREAT, made me cry
but it should have ended way earlier
Also Vordox, did you see my image? :D
and again you can evil as hell or be a fucking saint you still get the same endings regardless of moral choice
MadSurge: Indeed. that's what I said... All closures are made on YOUR side, or the game side? =/
SpadeMagnes[School]: Yep
SpadeMagnes[School]: I can unerstand the rage. >.>
Why give players that choice if it doesnt matter in the end
SpadeMagnes[School]: But... did you do ALL of that in the game for a change, or did you do it cause you wanted to?
but on your deathbed, can't you change everything you stand for?
SpadeMagnes[School]: For completinist, they must have been FRICKING PISSED.
and your cohices earlier in the game, don't they matter in what expereince you have while playing?
I wanted to do the right choices, I have this issue where I cant stand being a jerk
SpadeMagnes[School]: Know the feel. ._.
SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm a saint person myself.
Mostly same here, though I do ocatoinally play as a raider in fallout
BASTARD *Raises Pitchfork*
!
I rp! I rp!
However, I see a graphical end, sure it's not much...
But I see beyond it, I can get my own closure.
Im always confused in cases when theres a difference between morally right and what you think is right
games should never show you waht is right and wrong
All philosophicla, if the game can't give me it, I'll create it myself. :P But you paid for an ending, you damn well want to get one
why is winter so damn warm
SpadeMagnes[School]: You mean those game that "FREEDOM" but they still give you moral choices. XD
Everyone, read the van buren design documents on fallout wikia
I think it's a masterpiece of "All these choices are wrong"
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
Chrysalis yeah, the last 2 weeks have been way to warm here
huh, ld42 free weekend
Vivix: Like moral choice? You mean like Walking Dead? XD
curse my going home for the weekend
Walking Dead is very good at it too
but in Van Buren they are veeery long term
Vordox: I heard that game has good choices
like helping a dying gang of ghouls, is basically killing people
not helping them is killing their innocent ones
So yeah Vivix ... Lackluster ending, but all implied endings has huge changes.
ignoring it is furthering the issue-
http://epicfreeprizes.com/?ref=1421632
But... people are too used to getting stuff, and never think. Which is a sad evolution of game. :(
Fallout is fucking vauge on which choices are right
It iis
yeah, and I love that
when I play a game to plaay it, I want to experience a story
Nier had such a masterful closure...
I had a fucking hard time decided if the Ncr or Mr house was right or wrong
The choices in the Walking Dead don't really lead to anything diofferent in the end, but they make slifght differences withing the episode
And we NEVER know what happened to the other 2...
*deciding
;_;
Lil_B: Until the ending..
Yeah, Obsidian did a really good job in FNV, even if the start is shaky
Vivix really?
Vordox is ep 5 out yet? or did it only have 4?
i thought it was pretty poor
I can clearly tell the legion is evil
Vordox: Shush, you hussie!
Lil_B: 4 so far.
MadSurge: Sorry but it's TURE
True*
Sometimes in CYOA games you have fake choices, fake choices feel like real choices, and as such you get experience of choosing
:D
MadSurge: The fourth ending was the best closure. :P
MadSurge: BUT it never said anything.
Chrysalis, depends, I guess, I thought the major arch was better than F3, but that F3 was better as a Complete story
MadSurge: <3 NIER BEST GAME 2010!
But god damn it is amusing throwing the NCR general off the damn
*dam
f3 also played much better
This is a really interesting watch if you have the time. I also encourage checking out the rest of the channel's videos. www.youtube.com/watch?v=328wX2x_s5g
storys not worth a damn when it feels so detatched
Vordox: everything left up in the air~ Cavia is best trolls
I think the mechanics were better in FNV, actually
mornin
MadSurge: Well, not ALL of it.
MadSurge: Trolled by Cavia
MadSurge: You still had to go through that bit...you know THAT bit.
SpadeMagnes[School]: YEP :D
That's what I mean about the shaky start in FNV, you get no motivation to actually do shit
whilst in F3--you do
MadSurge: And when it happened you were crying...BIG ficking crying..
Vivix felt too cod like
I fucking love Dark Id's lp of Drakengard
I dunno abou that one, the only real changes were to iron sights
Vordox: there are MANY that moment. Which one? :D
MadSurge: The text
and F lore things, removing of visible skillchecks in text
it's just--better mechanically
God help you if you go through the game with low intelegence
Things get silly
Vordox: aaaah, the tree one or the hussie one?
MadSurge: No, the D Ending.
When the text was being taken, remember?
Vordox: Hello, InsertNameHere!
MadSurge: XDYes THA tpart
so still no stream
Vivix: Well, if anything...
Vivix: Watch a good LP of Nier. If you can find one.
I will, if I find one
Vivix: You will miss out the experience of a life time....
Which is sad. :(
Hehe, that's the curse of no consoles once in a while
I read more than I play, honestly,
but I do love games, and what goes into making them-
Vivix: look for TheDarkID's LP. It's a screenshot LP, but it's great nonetheless :D
screenshot and voice, or?
I'll just google it
Vivix: and if you can, look at his Drakengard LP too :D
Also it bothers me in games where the hero saves the world and he gets no respect
yes it does
oh, and hi!
Hi artist :)
Its a major thing for me in the Megaman BattleNetwork series
Hello artist! :)

Lil_B: saywut?
oh Nittany_Discord hi, Sonny was lookin' for ya
Dark_Horst do you know what an ARG is?
dont think so
Pain?
so much pain
Dark_Horst it stands for Action Reallife Game. It's a Game, or challange that isn't really a Game you can buy
talking about portal: http://derpy.me/4a
It worries me when I hear the insides of my ds games moving
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Garrys Mod / Source Pinkie Pie Playset
11,01Thought it stood for Alternate Reality Game?
still confused
Nittany_Discord can be as well, I just always read Actiaon Reallife Game :/
MahBoi777: why u in pain
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7662/
whats going on in here?
Dark_Horst in the Portal 2 ARG the "Potato Sack" came out on Steam, these were 13 Indie games which all got strange Patches
stuff
Dark_Horst the players had to figure out Passwordsa, combins STuff, search through the folders of the Game Files, and even finding Starnge Files on the Developers Websites
Panda: only the gods know....
in other news, vanilla candles are the best candles ever
thats new
Dark_Horst one Riddle was hanging on a Potato Sack infront of a Developers Headquaters
SpeccyRush: I have no idea lol
lol
hey Panda! ^_^
Panda: whats your DA?
Dark_Horst than you could via some cryptic actions get to Aperture Sience LKogin Screens and had to enter codes, which would give you a potato (//I found mny first one by accident and then read further into it)
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f93c869bec4d4cc52d6539068ec29b2d.jpg Pinkie wanted some rock candy :D
wha?
LOL nice

kyuuuu <3
i juat hope they punch in some metagame until then
http://imgur.com/0IJLz
MadSurge: same here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_XV3nniNi4

Hey MadSurge

Hehe, that part where I say "I should be studying for my exams" but instead just waste time on Browniestate.
Hi Lil_B
how can I... log out of Steam?
Lil_B: you can't hahaha
Lil_B: it will keep you forever
should be an icon in your tray, right click that and close
Lil_B pop it out and close?
Lil_B: or try the options
Lil_B: steam > change user
^
I know I can close it, but I need to get to the Password screen
u can go offline mode but if u wanna go offline then close it ._.
Oh steam not stream
I have tried everything but it says that's the only way to get there >.<
oh
"first crush: Sam Adib (from real life)" hahahaha
Michael thanks I'll try that
BroHoof I know I can quit, but I need to log off, and I have auto log on when I start the programm :P
:D
Lil_B: oh well then Michael's way is the one u need
worked :) (but that's a weird way, all I wanted to do is change my Password which I forgot...
i liek help people
Lil_B: u know u could have done that inside steam ._.
Lil_B if you can't find any other way you can always open the configuration files
I know, but even there it asks for my old Password, which I forgot
Oh ok
Lil_B: oh yea that's true
if u wanted change pass, then steam > parametres

Ah, well, still a good step toward the happy canary we all know.

Dat Shizuka

ohai Shizuka
Though this sounds remixed...
whereas ive heard gangnam several hundred times
I bet this song has been played all over the radio
If you've seen Canarys facebook status, you'd know shes damn well better ^_^
08,01the DAC on my laptop's soundcard is *horrible*
+1000
Dken2021: I bet Gangnam Style's been played much more.
08,01plus most modern music is overcomped

Late you say?
08,01yup
As much as I LOVE classical/orchestral music, I never bothred to remember the names of most pieces.
08,01to be fair, it's really obscure
08,01and you'd probably only know it if you're an organist
08,01like me
08,01:P
You harvest organs?
08,01yes, DerpyMuffins
:D
Couldn't be brahms, could it?

DoctoDoctorWho: someone is using my name
also, boys, a quick lesson, playing a girls favorite jazz song is the best way to get a date with her
You know, I've never head of any jazz muscians, or song names, and I've no desire to. There's something I enjoy about just being able to switch onto it and listen regardless.
RAWRity: That's kind of completely awesome
oh man plushies
08,01Lyra`: not heard much of him, but what i've heard i've liked
It's good for NaNoWriMo too. Helps me concentrate.

or house rent boogie?
08,01blues isn't the main styule of music i'm into
Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
So....
08,01i'm mostly an old classical toff

Deeeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.

Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeead
try to find the version they played in Blues Brothers
sonicdude558: Nice! :)
huh so apparently ACR is either glitchy as hell or the multiplayer servers are messed :S which explains my ps3 crashing though it works good w/ uncharted,etc. i hope AC 3 doesnt have these problems :(
Dken2021: oh ty that worked
Sketch_Toku_Brony: just wait for an Hour or two
anyone know the band GoodLuck?
Emry is going to work on my piniiepie plushie soon :3
And you killed it
theyre a south african band, like, around cape town, and theyre AWESOME!
thelonepony: did it happen to you too?
the best way I'VE found to get a date is to be a girl's friend for years until she asks you out. Granted that's not very feasible in the short term but hey.
08,01x1es: i do dig me a bit of that
i Don't have A PS3 :$
I will not have to stick with my imaginary one for long :P
RAWRity, unless shes desperate, she wont ask out a friend shes had for that long
But sometimes you have to wait for a bit
thelonepony: oh :D well the multiplayer in ACR has been like this lately and its not my ps3 since it plays Uncharted no prob
Dken2021: i have one how do i do it
hate to tell you this
u should get one thelonepony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KDHViSGD8s

So technically there is no stream
sonicdude558, Aw man it's mah man Chadwarden
08,01one was a sonata-form piece for viola, organ, cello, and tubular bell
I had no idea it was even possible to play jazz on the lyre >.>
I thought about this, and I think this will never happen,
its hard
08,01the viola was going in 4/4 time, the organ in 5/4 time, and the cello in 7/8
08,01it was kinda weird
but chadwarden should make another video
very hard panda
and compare the PS4 to the Wii u and Xbox 720
also, PM time, panda
O_O
sonicdude558 you don't hear from him these days
why the hell did I speak /)_(\
right

Oi sonicdude558. There's a stream.
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: indeed
the string instrument sounds flat
Not really ASoftFluffyThing
and the drums fade into the background
"its the fool who plays it cool, and making his world a little colder" is a great line in hey jude, something many people should think about
08,01Lyra`: it's most likely the way it's recorded/mastered
08,01the EQ is way off
