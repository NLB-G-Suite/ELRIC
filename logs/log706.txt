-ish
This is also why they wanted to get the Dish Hopper pulled. the commercial skipping feature was "interfering with commercials" since it was on by default
Whats the BState debate about this time?
Does BBC america have commercials?

Unlucky.
we are used to it
wait thiz many ppl on in middle of night

Am I wrong to sometimes think some peoples opinion is retarded from my viewpoint?
No, that's fine. It happens with many of us. Although, I wouldn't say "Retarded", I'd go with "A high level of stupidity."

Theres actually a medal for beating the elite 4 with a team of one type
Also Imprision is the most usless fucking move ever
It only is useful if the opponent has one of the moves you have
then use it on a smergel

yeah thats been around for a while most would reappear after beating the elite
You just have to re beat the elite four and go back to where you fought it the first time
how are ya?
Its fucking impossible to get though

$1000? o.o
yeah... >_>
I only spent $400 on this one
:p
but I spent $60 upgrading the RAM on it
might be more now that I think about it..
I wanted to add a 4GB RAM stick to my laptop
Is DDR3 still the newest ram right now?
7 am waking up in da morningszszszzzsz *failed duckface*
now if I hear it I laugh :p
I haven't heard of anything newer
awesome
mhm...
7am and I go back to sleep. -.-
well, if you're going to upgrade that laptop you should probably do something about the hard drive first :P
:p
I saw a flipnote of that
I think I finally have come to a conclusion
I was thinking of doing that
My favourite pony is
. . .
but its going to cost me close to $100 to do that
spike
/me drum rolls
thanks for that
:D
Welp, I need to sleep
bai :3
/me drum rolls
. . .
Pinkie Pie! :o
It needs to be at least 200gb
Yay!~
except that I don't have a Pinkie-sence or laugh and break the 4th wall
Luna is best pony
Discussion alert!
>_>
NERD BATTLE
I might just stick to using a desktop
Yeah <_<
and get a tablet
IRL friends
But I'm already behind you
Muahahaha! In America.
One does not simply chose a favorite pony
I keep telling them the UI is weird and doesn't make sense, and they just say "you get used to it"
Well okay, but that doesn't stop it from being a crappy design
*choose
/me walks into Mordor
^DEAL WITH IT
just pick one or the other...
is spike
/me *drum rolls*
is....
well everypony i have to go
My favorite is twilight because..well I'm pretty much like her.
/me eats an apple in slowmotion to add extra dramatic effect
/me *glump*
As far as personality, I'm sort of a cross between Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie.
. . .
but for a desktop...I dont know
damnit I can't find it O_O
yeah, I would like it tablets I think
some say it's derpy
*on tablets
It looked like there were some things that took more steps if you had a laptop/desktop
it's very awkward to use on a non-touchscreen though
/me is actually eating an apple.
at least to me
exactly, I agree
nemnemnemnemnem
maybe they should've just made it a tablet OS
It IS lunchtime for me. lol XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI
and she's the main character of the show (as pointed out)
haha, that's interesting
I don't remember 95 at all haha
me neither, didnt have a computer with it at the time
ok i have a driving lesson now back in a couple of hours
But we had ME for probably like 2 weeks
And we reverted it
*Diamond
My favorite is still XP... probably because my first laptop had it
Picture hearing that in a classroom when 30 computers turn on at once
Gotta head off for now
be back in 30-60 minutes :)
me too actually
oh ok
well... she has the power to raise (so actually move) the FREAKING SUN wich is about 100000 times the mass of the earth...
I keep forgetting too to PM you
and?
But it's not Earth. It's Equestria
Plot,magic
and I'm like... hu?
right BUT
Okay
equestria has to be a planet as well right?
see you
See ya
Not as we know it
and asuming there's a minumun you can go to create an actual sun that works the way ours does
But it doesn't. :P
Heck, S2E13 states unicorns can do it.
it's jsut
just*
messing up Logic
05Everlasting_Joy: no, ultimate power is when the sun moves itself for you
MEEEEEEEGIC
I need to send him somthing °-°
I'd have to say the Wedding episode cemented my hatred for celestia
05^_^
I'm back paesani \:3/
I hear again! But I gotta take some meds for the ear swelling
The fuck celestia
But no she doesnt even say that!
Applejack did
And...?
^
The way Twilight went about it, I wouldn't have believed her either. =/
I would have given her the benifit of the doubt
*still
05easy
05blue
No no its just the wedding! Bullshit
05Serenity: girlfriedns are awesome
brb
What's a girlfried?
05as are wifes, problem comes in the transition
05besides nowadays a marriage isnt more than something financial
05like inviting me to a wedding
^:D
05aswell as booze
It's not a wedding without booze.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHPOesXCFcI
^
I. Hate. Drunkards. More. Than. Anything
05maybe at the actuall wedding
05cermony*
I wouldn't have an after party- unless he or she wanted one- but even then, no booze pls- for my sake
05you say no boose
>Gets married > Dies of alcohol poisoning.
05clearly you havent had snaps with me
05so much fun
?
05Everlasting_Joy: if i ever visit the US
I'm not an alcoholic either, but I don't believe you can raise a toast without champagne. >.>
05ill brign a bottle of snaps
05and 2 glasses
scchhhhnaps
I've never really had a bad alcohol experience, and drunk people can be fun, I just don't enjoy the thought of being drunk
:D
05who said anythign about beign drunk?
05tipsy at best
05its the smashers you should avoid
/me waves to everyone
^
My brother
The bastard knocked me round the head and cracked my skull >:U
I don't mind having a drink now and then, but I don't enjoy being tipsy or--anything
05worst part about being drunk
The hangover?
05you loose cigarretes in the thousands
05i dont get hungover
Why? Cuz everyone drank reasonably
^:)
I sort of understand the news about the 13 episodes froma buisness standpoint...but i still find it stupid
05Panda: i recall ocne i went otu for a smoke wit ha couple of friends
05we ended up in our haze to smoke 6 each in a row
05jstu casue we wanted to keep the convo goign
13 episodes news is part of the reason, not the full reason
05aye
:/
05mine has mint filters
05and 1 pack wont help
05i do onyl rbing 1 pack
but everyone else also have cigarettes, I guess
05and then people beging to give eachother and beg from eachother
05eets silleh
here, all the rage is doing snuff instead of cigarettes
it's--WORSE
eww.
05snuff as in nasal? or snus? :P
snus yeah
noone aims at the garbage can
snus? O_o
05kidn of liek chewing tobacco but without any chewing
all the 18 yearolds here are doing it
That's.... really weird
Don conform
Dont*
05it has its ups and downs
all being 40% of the smokers I guess
05for isntance in a proper friend circle
05we can be indoors
05no one has to go out for a smoke
05and theres garbage cans a plenty
http://memegenerator.net/instance/28914917
XD no ashe trays around?
05smoking indoors isnt very...
Ash*
05polite
http://fav.me/d5iakfc
05Vivix: casue its a school
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM Tetris Time!
05with you know
05teenagers
Celestia is actually just pretending
well, 18+ hehe
05and they cant sue their brains
:p
well, if noone minds, I don't see the issue in that :)
but yeah, snus and coffecups, Eveyrwhere. by the end of the year the chef was screaming at us in the all-room about his rapidly decreasing cup-stock
05what about the smoke settign inside the walls
XD
05lowering the value of the property
Yeah, that's worse
especially ceilings, you have to repaint and everything
You can't repaint it... trust me
all hope is lost-
It seeps through
ew~~
05parintign wont fix it
05hence
05balconies
05<3
^
hehe yeah, all polite people tend to smoke outside now
Maybe that's why snus is more popular at winter
05Kandarihu: proving my point further
05only smoked indoors twice iirc. 1 being on the trainstation in the smokers room
Well, my grandparents own a house and they have a designated smoke room.
I used to work in some communal crap for young people without jobs, and we cleaned some old guys appartment- with like 5 year old cans of cereal, and--YELLOw walls and ceilings
horrible
05and otehr on the airport being smokers room
05then id ecided not to use smokers rooms anymore casue you cant breatehr in them
Near non stop
05no cause they are tiny and cramped
That too ^-^
tiny + smoke = bad
Maybe its to get people not to smoke, I dunno.
05ive been smoking less and less
05yay for burritos then
You don't use the bathroom??
Sneak and use the faculity one
05and throws it out the window
^-^
05like its 1776
I know
XD
05hehe
Haha, but smoke rises
05Panda missed the point entirely :P
05we talked about excrement
05and then suddenly smoke rises
Meh, I lived. Once winter rolled around, it got a lot easier.
05peopel stopped smokign in the winter?
05what kind of country does that
"I did not hit her I did naht"
05speakign of winter
05its been -5 all day
... I d Oidn't know that smokers hibernated
Didnt*
Go go envirobear
05but can you take the cold?
Of course
05Everlasting_Joy: not really?
05its cold
Went snowboarding with a tank top on xD I'm very insulated
05demperature Panda`
05?*
05t^*
It snowed here today
for a shor while
*in
Hm... fluxuated between 15 and 30
05aaah wisconsin, where polka comes from
Wat
05Panda: is that celcius, kelvin or madeupature?
Though, I can say I didn't last long with a lack of clothing
05so at its coldest it was -1 celsius
05we currently have -5 outside
05winters usualyl hit -30
/me shudders
We usually don't go below -25, but last two years it has been crazy cold-
05so thats... -22 farenheit
Pfft, I've been in winters that cold and I'm alive.
But I've been in below 0 weather before while I was there. We arrived at the coldest time of the year and it stormed xD
Not minus 30!
My bad.
05all you need to survive is a proper jacket, maybe gloves and a proper pair of shoes
Pants
You need pants
A good coat, hat and maybe boots and I'm set.
Though jeans are uncomfortable to board in xD
05but yeah
05the coldest winter ive had
05cant recall how cold it was
05and it istn melting
05and it doesnt egt warmer
I once got a brainfreeze walking home from school. That was probably the coldest I've experienced-
The coldest winter I remember was when I was in 8th grade, around 2003.
/me never wears a hat
or lue, whatever that is in english
05i fail to wear a hat aswell
/me wears hats
I remember for about two weeks, the high was in the -20 to -30 F (-28 to -34) and the nights were even worse.
05i usualyl jsut use the hood on my hoodie if its too cold otuside
05its awesome
hellau everyone
Winter and streetlights give me a lot of nostalgic memories
I don't need a hat, my hair is already gigantic and warm :D

05or work on luna and watch mars attacks!
05choices choices
work on luna then.......marsk attacks!
mars*
Forgive me for never hearing of "Mars Attacks!", but that sound like something form the '60s.
admit it you read it in his voice http://derpiboo.ru/130553
96 Actually.
05http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116996/
Now I know :).
:P
/me breakdances
05also voted the extrended cut of the abyss for A movie
05that shit is 3 horus long man
At least it isn't 6.
or..lott
o
i usually go at the cinema instead of watching it here :P
movies that is
I only really go to the cinema if there's something really good I want to see
which is--damn rare
05artist: implying movies that are shown here air nowadays in theaters
Time travel!
really really really
walking out on a cinema would just --mortify me
why?
loud?
to loud?
Because I'd be..interrupting peoples viewing, and appearing rude
are you 8 feet long?
And we go tot the cinemas all the time
Hehehe
That's that's fine
I mean, I would feel really bad if I went to a movie, didn't like it, and walked out
05we went and saw the 3rd twilight movie in the cinema
Did a MST3K riff?
05and we threw abcon chips on the girls in front of us each time they screeched
lol
thats great
05halfway through they stopped
Yeah~~ I'd just feel bad, despite probably noone noticing
!
Yeah, that was a strange situation
I did actually see Twilight at the cinema
and was--surprised that it wasn't horrible-
but- it's not really worse than any of the other teen movies I've seen-
She does look scarily unemotional
like she's constantly on heroin-
Protaganists..DO SOMETHING
Hey, I liked Pants.
She was a... well, she was a character.
But honestly, it's not horrible, it's just- meh
And then 50 shades happened
yeah, that's the issue
At least it's great for Rifftrax :D
Hehe
05no really
Yes really.
Orlyt
*Orly
yarly
(She is)
She does look constantly tripping
05litterally
05and we were all like "adn the girls liek this..."
/me is a sucker for romance
buut-- it isn't really
05its tragic and you should feel ashamed
/me gags. "I'm fine, I'm fine."
Why are girls attacted to that garbage?
Remember when vampires were cool...
it's-- kinda a movie more about--being messed up, and kinda choosing between two people without really --showing any romance
05no wait
I kinda think vampires are stupid, like- all vampires
like Blades? Gaag-
05what a great idea it was
I find it awesome.
hi
05and also
05without drugs
:D
mmm~~
05think about that for a second
because of drugs we have no Syd Barrett
because of drugs- most bands died and sucked
Yeah, the gay one
I don't think the others drank or did drugs- not sure
Think so-

Mead, had that one on Larpa once
05sjätte tunnan in stockholm is one of the few places that serve it
05good one too
Shame it's such a 'dead' drink, that mead.
like flat?
Oh right, yeah
I dunno why, on Larpa, most of the people make it themselves

08,01pfft, you always blame kira.
kira is overrated
08,01kira killed my goldfish
deathnote is overrated
13kira killed my childhood
still decent
08,01the first half of deathnote is amazing
08,01and it should have ended there
people need to understand that overrated=/= bad
Saturn: yea, but then it got BORING
08,01aye
deathnote wasnt even that clever
Just as planned
it was a great idea with decent execution
I like lots of things that're overrated. :P
i thought of kiras plan 10 eps before he did, and nothing was preventing him from doing it the (spoilers) first time mica got captured
not really a hero,
i never said that
08,01well, i enjoyed it
kira was quite empty too
08,01and i'm really clever
08,01and popular
hello everyone? whats the subject about?
:o deathnote!
08,01snow!
AKA one of hte most overrated animes ever
meh, i watched it, it was good
08,01twilight_sprinkle: like a teen romance novel
But lets take Gurren lagann, it was a simple idea with a spectacular execution and ended how it shouldve
Overated isnt always a bad thing
also GITS
=_=
They both want to conquer
they both are highly intelligent

Eagle for president
but its still alive :D
Twilight for prezident
Maybe Derpy
id rather have romney as president
NO
NO PRESIDENTS IN EQUESTRIA
WE DO NOT WANT A USA EQUESTRIA
uhm...
romney as president of America
luna for president?
id rather live in equestria
be a pony lol
hopefully it lasts a little bit longer
Well, we can narrow it down to Americans
Do like Sweden :P
Silly Sweden
i want to move to scotland or something
seriously.
As one woman said it that amused me
i just want to move to somewhere in europe
Money 'stash
I dont even
And more recently, there's the whole "OBAMA PHONE" woman.
=_(\
more reason for president
I agree
A bunch of people beat the shit out of him because he had a romney sign in his lawn
seriously, choclate rain guys
CHOCLATE RAIN!
He's ok though
I heard about that, too.
I doubt that person would vote any different even without that silly comment, and I even doubt he'll vote at all
now lets get out of this political discussion please
PLEASE
This isn't political, this is about judging other people
Something you do quite a lot
No more political talk?

Speaking about RE..
RE6 is good

No

I hate you.
I'm being idiotic and fasecious, i'm sorry.

I larv u 2 alcamast
:)
Socks: Really?
Go ahead.
Well finally ordered the book I need for school... for 4€... and 2 games for 30€ ... I think I can't sspenmd anymore for school now...
Games are educational.
BUY MORE.
4chan is a great site
^
no its not
Socks: ._.
deal with it
Opinionated
dem Propaganda xD
Then go play the old ones
Come back when you have a REAL opinion?
is resident evil 2 pretty good?
RE6, then go play RE1 or RE2
And now... Yeah it still holds up, aged as heck though
Yeah, I wont speak here >.>
stories
Most old games do not have a story, or very thin
<.<
old games are fun, but many have slim to no stories, just like Indie games
My computer's download speed for my wow is slow
Its going like 1.14-1.49 MB a second
Had to reinstall the whole thing
aww
PONDOOOO
i warb u
Look at Castlevania 1 or 2, what's the story(Not from Manual, but from the game)
I agree with you
dawwifeelspeshul:>
/me is back
Anythin' streamin'?
Huzzah.
*then
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pre-Reader Q&Neigh Numero Cuattro
yay~
SUDDENLY ALIENS
Voice acting isnt really necessisary for a good story
That Derp Roll'd.
that explains it
I'm trying to learn to understand
It's HARD.
LETS DO IT
t
BUT if you want a REAL good sstory(Narrative + Voice acting) go for RE1
Try beating contra with no continues...
At the moment, I'm studying Narrative forms of the games...
/me messes up Jmo's mane
huzzah~
messy mane.
Try IWBTG
HOHOHOHO
Poyo
cuuz gaames are fuuun
never had an nes...didn't like the showcase games, didn't try the underdogs
Well if I ever get time...
Action 64.....
Ruin games for myself sometimes. ._.
We need more people like that
The Experience = Aethetics.
Up Up Down Down
yes
i play contra
without the code
Aww~~
Hm?
Just look at me. :P
Hehehe
"I don't like this mechanics, I do not like this menu, I do not like this system" etc etc.
"What if they change this here to this here?"
I think- most indie games try to change mechanics to a point where they are just a bunch of tech demos-
true-
Of course... we have the famous "Flow breaker"...
I admire gamedevs- but it's not a profession for me
And sometimes its the same now its sucks
Like for example, if you played RE6, you sometimes have cutscenes or scripted events.
Fanbases are too finicky
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT with a zombies
diidn't play, but yeah
Out of all the games, RE6 o.o
Mood whiplash!
Why, oh why
of course, that's- yeah a preference
Cause you're in the matrix.
the hub?
Where you choose, basically, the World.
ohh
Oh boy that is slow.
Oh...
Some one clearly doesnt browse EQD
but--it works well enough
Interesting...
You know about it, and you can communicate about it...
COmpared to me. :D
I thought this villian thing was just a rumour
Hehe, I tend to like snapping up things and analyzing them on the fly
sometimes that makes me say really uneducated guesses, but- just how it is
Hmm-
I really should play Skyward sword again...
Hello Kitty Online.
...
:>
lolno
Thank Celestia. :D
Played that shit for 5 minutes and cried after.
Ok, take Dishonoured
(Spoiler free as well)
Okay yeah-
Are you charging per hour for this?
Steampunk world, with robots?
hard*
Kinda- it's more like, eh 1700s france with magic and steampunk, whith a strange mix of tech
yes
they deliver you the strategy guide ingame now. forced tutorial, forced hints, etc
yeah, and the details felt up close, rather than "view only"
There's 4 Narrative story routes.
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/54571eb93355d01a0490f0601cb769d6.jpg Not enough Pinkie, but CLOSE ENOUGH <3
Yeah,
All right, I'm going to take off.
kind of, the modular is-- kind of down, you know? I don't think its a good feature
O.o
the HUB is--a resting point between "missions"
How does it feel "off?"
Somehinglike Catherine?
Hey listin
*listen
Never played Catherine- but maybe
<,< never played that either-
>_>
Take this mission/stage, complete, back to Stage Select.
<,<
Oh
Just
REALLY?
but no eh--
Okay, okay....
Hmm. Like Donkey Kong?
I have played LBP, but long time ago-
evening paizanos
yeah, basically. You have the option to upgrade, or mess around in that area, but you have to go wiht the linear story
is there no stream yet?
yeah- it kinda makes sense for the story, but--it did feel odd when combined with the mission select in the main menu
Odd change.
Kinda, I wanted to replay missions with different loadouts, jsut to have fun
Hehe
saty tuned*
:p
Anything related to the story(Random NPC talk etc)
Hmmm.
Daaw dat FlutterSsassin :D http://sunnyrays.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-Assassin-268681180
it acts as your--bedroom, you sleep between missions- it gives a sense... of belonging I guess
eh- kind of, can't say too much without spoilers on that
but it acts as one yes
I think the reason it felt odd, is because it can be reminiscent of other games with a more stage select hub, which makes you expect certain thigns that don't happen
I can't go into the other part without spoilering-
Yeah
and now sad de lancie
Once you get used to something, or fond of something, you generally want more of it
:(
Thing is- I'm not especially fond of mission select, but it reminded me of mission select
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Let's Find You a Date! (Update Complete!)

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates October 24th (Afternoon)
two links in a few seconds? boy they work fast
The more you get stuck on "easy" quirks..
The less you appreciate the games
wow, that season finale
fuck
Even if they are good or bad.
Are you two seriously still on that?
but it's a thing that as a designer, one usually watches out for
BBL everypony, going to guild
ciao
Heya everypone ;)
laters, enjoy youself
Nittany here ye-
mmmh
guess he's not...
Nono, of course not
Trying to pull the mechanics away from the mainstream gaming.
Anyway.....
okay, bad analogy
Hehehe
NEEEERDS
Yeah, analyzing or--whatevering
:?>
Right....
COmpany wise however... >.>
Well I do not know the full facts.
So- that makes consumers angry
I think someone pointed ou their netloss
productions costs and maintenance costs overgoing the income of their games
Again ME3 for example
I didn't like ME2
Seriously? This again?
11,02Morning everypony :)
HOWEVER
Hi NewSuperBronyU~
Bullshit
But- I got it reiterated, was it that bad?
:O man S3 looks like its gonna be awesome~
an*
inb4 he hasn't played FFVII
Well people want closure to those kinds of games
:P
<.<
Neva.
;D
Hehehe
I respect that, gaming experience whatnot
There is no brain there. Tis a lie.
didn't*
My brain was lost to ponies and goaticorns
Frekin Goaticorns.
It ended EXACTLY the same as ME3. :P
Yet I do NOT hear a single bad mouthing FFVII.
Which makes me just sick that people complained.
Sometimes- that's really cool
There was ONE thing that pissed everyone off..
/me disclaimer: did not play ME3
It was the goat.
mm?
08,01bleh
08,01tired
Hai Saturn .
08,01hi hvordox
08,01that's because i don't sleep sensibly
hi Saturn :)
I like endings where I feel good about my choices
hi Saturn
Ooh... was, that where they split them off?
it was quite distint. it have 3 very dofrent colors
08,01Dken2021: i wore it on my bum

/me holds and cries
I don't mind
I wouldn't care.

<!DOCTYPE spoilers>
Okay, spoilers incoming(Original atleast)
Yeah, I've seen one on a joke site
Hi everypony :(
Explosions, Vaporization, or Inoculated.

Which way would you go?
None of those ways
but--closure
Why cant we have a endign where we dont die
Ohkay

It's ONLY spoilers if you CLICK the link

Whats the point of makeing moral decisions in a trilogy when they mean nothing in the end?
I just came home from school and what's the point?
School is a waste of time
talk with us? :3
Oh boy another school complainer.
What's the point? You're just going to forget about everything
School
Why you think I go in university atm. :
:P
Cuz yer a nerd verdex.

that and goaticorns
;D
Nothing gamebreaking, mind you
Cyoa?

I'm watching it at the moment

Drakengard!
Tohou...
did anyone say Touhou?
ahh--
Touhou!
ah- probably not for me then
Hehe, but it's more challenge based than...
05(if you're a watcher of my da than you might wanna read the latest note there...)
you know?
I have no idea
okay-
not yet, firsto ne now I think-
Tohou is sad?
ohh
I like sad-
lurve it
*not
damn...
I don't
Can I play Nier on my NES?
i wna pway it on da nes
Sigh..its two thirty and I still havent gotten anything done
omai.
okay now I've seen the endings
You can join in too SpaceTransitPony
ROfl
Nuuu
colours..-
yeah
but--
that's it?
Yes, that is it. Rest is the same.
<--
I can't research anything for shit. XD
One method, to rule them all.
Oh, and holla all again. :)
I dunno- honeslty, I don't know
Pffft
they just feel like three different endings with little meaning to me
they are--crazy similar though
ah-
According to most opinions atleast.
Depends-
Juxtapose much, gamerS?
buuut
I kinda like the idea of you dying
and never knowing the rsult
result*
I wish my courses were easy enough to figure out on my own
<.<
I can hardly understand most of the shit I'm supposed to be learning in Pre Calc
some of my favourite games, and favourite books, have endings that are really vague or open
And they wanted still more.
true- I can see... why I guess
but it's more the why because of the promising
if there had been no promises, would people complain?
Hm..
I see 3 tottally different endings really.
Time to roll out.
Oh Vooooordox~ http://i.imgur.com/OGZqb.png
That's... not much that difference really XD
but if it weren't
it would be like to the moon
To the moon was GREAT, made me cry
but it should have ended way earlier
Why give players that choice if it doesnt matter in the end
I wanted to do the right choices, I have this issue where I cant stand being a jerk
BASTARD *Raises Pitchfork*
!
I rp! I rp!
However, I see a graphical end, sure it's not much...
But I see beyond it, I can get my own closure.
games should never show you waht is right and wrong
I think it's a masterpiece of "All these choices are wrong"
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
huh, ld42 free weekend
curse my going home for the weekend
but in Van Buren they are veeery long term
like helping a dying gang of ghouls, is basically killing people
not helping them is killing their innocent ones
ignoring it is furthering the issue-
http://epicfreeprizes.com/?ref=1421632
It iis
Nier had such a masterful closure...
*deciding
;_;
i thought it was pretty poor
True*

You know, I've never head of any jazz muscians, or song names, and I've no desire to. There's something I enjoy about just being able to switch onto it and listen regardless.
oh man plushies
It's good for NaNoWriMo too. Helps me concentrate.
have you heard Boom Boom?
or house rent boogie?
08,01blues isn't the main styule of music i'm into
08,01i'm mostly an old classical toff
ahah
08,01Lyra`: to be honest, i'm rubbish with names
Deeeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
well i'm back quicker than expected :D
you'd know Boom Boom if you heard it
http://i.imgur.com/JuUXf.jpg I am getting one soon
Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeead
try to find the version they played in Blues Brothers
anyone know the band GoodLuck?
Emry is going to work on my piniiepie plushie soon :3
And you killed it
theyre a south african band, like, around cape town, and theyre AWESOME!
08,01x1es: i do dig me a bit of that
i Don't have A PS3 :$
But sometimes you have to wait for a bit
hate to tell you this
08,01i used to write jazzy pieces
Intermission :P
You could of Pm the Link to me :3
/me loads m200 intervention
08,01one was a sonata-form piece for viola, organ, cello, and tubular bell
I had no idea it was even possible to play jazz on the lyre >.>
its hard
08,01the viola was going in 4/4 time, the organ in 5/4 time, and the cello in 7/8
08,01it was kinda weird
and compare the PS4 to the Wii u and Xbox 720
O_O
right
this is my favorite part of the song~
that solo <3
08,01i remember chadwarden
08,01wait, no
er PS
08,01something like that
Sooooo
/me 08,01does not know about videogames
Is anything interesting happening in here?
/me squeezes everything
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: sure
It's alright Saturn. :D
Oh look, people.

And, as a matter of fact, they are hitting enter as well.

08,01Afrika Bambaataa
ENTER!
Saturn probably me, asked if you had anything
hi Dken2012
yes
...
we still in intermission
I believe the slim is not backward compatable with ps1
dang backwards compatible
This is quite a long intermission...
08,01Coldays: i was going to play some Journeyman, but people wanted to listen to music
WHY DIDN'T I BUY THE PS3?!
Enjoying the phrases though.
WHOA I FUQED UP
its ok Saturn
seems like we're a fickle people
13which journeyman?
Journeymen > Intermission
08,01Shizuka: just Journeyman
I like music.
08,01well, after the next 2 songs i'll play Journeyman
yes music good
*OVERUSED MEME ALERT* I like trains.

/me flinches expecting train to run him over
Some nice ones, actually.

Smashed a nice panoramic pair recently.

*:)

/me dodges the train like a baws
Or floor
Pinkie pie went idnoclip and boke the fourth wall.

08,01twilight_sprinkle: someone requested Flo Rida
Flo Rida?

Saturn: but i requested beatles .-.
This song is now ruined. Fuck you Flo Rida

08,01twilight_sprinkle: i just played beatles!
This and Levels by Avicii
I got my request
/me is enjoying the intermission
Flo Rida = Florida
08,01twilight_sprinkle: yes
08,01Pinkies4thWall: yup!
Saturn: oh...i missed it, my bad >.<
08,01i'll admit
/me nuzzles Saturn
08,01i know absolutely nothign abotu the beatles
08,01i can't even name them all
Ditto
^
i can name 3 of them
I only know the name of their band
I checked, Flo Rida is born in Florida! How ironic
Thats about it
but i dont really know that much about them either, i know most of their songs though
I only have two albums of the beatles
Wht's this song?
Flo Rida over the beatles? those are some wack priorities
Saturn was taking request before
I can easily say this is bad music
/me bewares
Someone wanted Flo

Requests eh?
MadeonMadeonMadeonMadeon
The Cure

Was really good at it too
i still play lyre, but my roomate bitches when i do.

Then my parents made me switch to piaano
piano
is this even music?
I play Xbox, does that count?
Dat vid link
I need to self-learn piano one day
I know how to play piano, but I hate it
08,01Lyra`: it's most likely the way it's recorded/mastered
Saturn: don't give me ideas, i have skype on a hairtrigger
Saturn: oooh. I may take you up on that one day.
08,01the EQ is way off
and you
turn off the EQ Saturn
oh
dont care, i dont liek this song.
nvm
/me is judging.
08,01Lyra`: don't worry, neither do i
Saturn: :O
anyone heard of Goodluck?
MY EYES!
how could you!
08,01Lyra`: if it's clean, sure
08,01Pinkies4thWall: go on then
I HAVE PERMISSION!
08,01Pinkies4thWall: acutally, maybe later
http://youtu.be/bsYf2Nq7odQ
