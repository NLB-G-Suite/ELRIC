AdamTheDuck: no
none of that
Yolo: carpe diem for the dimwitted.
You only die once
yodo?
AppleBloom, even with Goku vs Frieza?
actually, Yolo covers more basis in a literal sense than carpe diem, therefore yolo > carpe diem
Carpe diem: Saying for people who want to look cool
Hey-o.

lel no boobs for hoodi
Princess Tutu is best magical girl
00,10sudden end
man there are some dark ass animes going on right now
question
no
answer
go ahead
rebuttal
adjective
pronoun
where mah gerunds at
in the time that it takes them to actually transform... couldnt said monster have attacked and possibly ended the fight there? :)
twilight_sprinkle: you left them in the cafeteria again, you should be more careful
i was at the store today and there was a wine w/ the brand name adverb
Rule of fun, Ryunosuke.
Unnr: i hope someone doesnt try to eat them again..
Ryunosuke: the monster was too busy staring at underage boobs
Ryunosuke: that is the million dollar question for every magical girl anime
twilight_sprinkle: Well you know, like ya do.
Ryunosuke, transforming is a free action. It took a minute for the viewer's benefit, but in the canon timespace, it was about a second
I think that's the way it works for most magical girl warrior series.
Yay anime logic
this one, and most others, have to chant something for it to actually happen, what about then? :)
00,10unless it's digivolving
so the ferret thing is the cute menchi fanservicy thing eh
00,10that takes real time
hello everypony
00,10twilight_sprinkle
Hi, SkunkTari. :)
Sumica:
ello SkunkTari
00,10remember the boy at the start from her dream
wonder JP will make version of MLP like PPGZ? :D that would be neat
Sumica: fraid not
He's a Deamon
Ryunosuke, she only had to do it once. After that, all she has to say is "Raising Heart, ONEGAI!"
you streamin, mica?
00,10aye
ah
si
Sketch_Toku_Brony, I fear that they would INSIST on humanizing the ponies.
Remember kids, this is Japan. So if you have any questions, keep them to yourselves
00,10what's wrong with humanised ponies?
^
eh, humanized ponies dont work for me personally, doesnt have the same dawish effect, plus humans suk
00,10all the propirty damage
Sumica, as in they wouldn't be ponies. They'd just be humans.
so?
you hate humans or something?
you as horse supremicist?
horses are the master race.
i would kinda wanna see it like this https://forums.playfire.com/_proxy/?url=http%3A%2F%2F29.media.tumblr.com%2Ftumblr_lvav2ztdSQ1qincmao1_500.jpg&hmac=7d995c1ce5f43ad139cd5f0bc973babd
I like humanized ponies Sumica
after cats
00,10depends on the style twilight_sprinkle
irl horses suck
link isn't working Sketch_Toku_Brony
real horses scare the shit outta me
Sumica: btw whyd you mention the kid in her dream?
as long as it isn't that whack ass shit with the humans with wings or humans with horns and shit
lawl hoodi try riding one, its hurts
00,10the ferret is the kid in her dream
that stuff aint all that good
Sumica: o ok. i hope excel shows up and eats the ferret tho
twilight_sprinkle: That's what a saddle is for. :P
twilight_sprinkle: I've ridden a horse without a saddle ;~;

Sketch_Toku_Brony: That's more anthro than human.
in every possible manner of the word
ded
Buytoast: Okay okay, lets get this straight here. Your talking about ponies with the same personalities, just in human bodies. Human skin, Twilight isn't purple, and she doesn't have a horn. Nothing anthro, just humans
Oh buck the cops

MadSurge: sets a goal for the main char
Huh? You mean Testarossa shouldn't be blonde?

thats surprising
You kidding? There is fanservice
XD
CW pls :3
did we not just watch a bath episode? O.o
00,10would be in poor taste to go too much in to fanservice with 12 year olds
well i missed it
In fact, fanservice is Arf's specialty.
well its anime
CW stahp ;A;
poor taste, or good taste? Sumica
there is fanservice no matter what age
Also, Japanese =/= English
xD
ur gonna be kicked CW, stahp. ;A;
+ nanohana strikers adds more fan service i belive
japanese anime's not dubbed are the best
every anime has epic intro ?
00,10usealy
Rocket: of course
i cant stand the dub version
english > japanese 95% of the time
00,10intro has to sell viewers on the show
Last Exile should be a thing here.
00,10the intro for an anime is usealy released 4 months before the show airs
00,10I have it
Sumica i think every intro showing "love story" somehow :D
00,10last exile that is
00,10in duel audio even

What'd wallmart do?
00,10the local store had all the deals already out on the floor wraped in plastic
00,10with signs saying wont ring up till after 8pm
I wonder, did we ever stream Azumanga Daioh here on Bronystate?
My mom already did some black friday shopping. She bought a laptop, printer, 32' inch tv and a 50' inch tv. I get the 32' inch TV! :D
00,10we have not
Ponies47: My tv is 42 inches :P
00,10nice Ponies47 but who needs a TV
sigh all i got were 2 games :/
Sumica did you see dukuro-chan ?
I need a tv to play video games on
ok.. i stoped crying 5 mins ago im fine now :>
aniderp why did you cry ?
ooo what anime made yall cry the most guys?
missing pets
I nearly cried at Clannad :(
my cat and dog
/me never cries from anything involving fiction
Sumica, I didn't ask her for one. But you have a point. I don't play video games that much either so basically there was really no point in buying it at all XD
aniderp: :)
Polydunami: ever watch air?
I mean, I was close, but never actually cried
No, but I have heard of it
Polydunami i did once >.<
twilight was like my best pal <3
i love this fox
And I've watched Kanon
Polydunami: can from the same guy that made cannon
snuggled with me and all that ^^
Ooooh tayaki! I wanna try some :D
Polydunami: also essintially the same plot too >.>
Sumica, tv's are for playing games on
Please tell me this "mother" is the villain...
Yeah, I understand that much. Snarky male lead makes friends with cute girls in high school, deals with their problems, and gets with one of them.
MadSurge: no way :O
this animes is pretty interesting :D
You laugh, you cry, and then you are happy.
Well, that's kind of embarrassing for me to say :$
00,10ah I see Phase4
wait.. is that girl that dog thingy?

Anyway, I watched more of Lost last night. I'm at the beginning of Season 3 now.

with jewel like on her forehead
thats the dumbest thing you could possibly name a dog
She shouldn't be Arf, but Stupid Dog :D

for dogs
its what japan dose
Onomatopoeia.
my dog's name was bingo
00,10so you are saying blend the two together Polydunami?
I wasn't quite going that route... but if it works, go right ahead
probly a lame name for a dog but me and my brother were young and he named him..
ooh, naked loli
:P
brother is older than me btw
silly anime
she naked.. get clothes on girl
Don't look at the chesticles
my god

ITS A TRAP
why does she take so damn long to transform?
and that kill 3 mins of the 22 misn this show is allowed
00,10Rule of cool
/me moves in and kills the magical girl while she twirls around
00,10also budget saveing
00,10if you say so Polydunami
Polydunami: small chests are best
/me smakes polydunami
00,10the biger the better the tighter the sweater

MadSurge: go watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica for that >.>
naturesfury: already seen! :D

DON'T TELL HER YOUR NAME
Oh, so you've got a computer voice calling your attacks?
Give her your address and credit card number too!
im gonna use the stelth move nexted ya. then weapon calls out tthe move FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
00,10the weapon's are AI's
00,10they often make there own decisions on what to use
Oh wow

wtb a damn dog whistle....
O_O
00,10suddnly monocrome

Talktalktalktalktalk, kill each other!
Polydunami: what time where you're art

It's 1:40 in the morning
And then they died! THE END
MadSurge: seems legit
YES
im guessing they both lost it
MadSurge: Can I kill people too :<
HoodyNinja: if it's not me then yes :D
Is this the same series that had the evil seed things that had to be destroyed?
dat s&m
oh god yes
applejack
AJ is best Ragna
not getting what this is based off of
00,10Blaze blue
This reminds me of the first ending to Code Geass
ahh never watched
>mfw no one knows blazblue
Isn't BlazBlue supposed to be a strategy game?
Fighting game
Polydunami: it is. just bosed off an anime
based**
Wait, it was originally an anime?
Nope
blazblue
strategy
wat
^
its like the talesof: games
Well, I know that much
blazblue
is not a damn strategy game
i really like these anime crossovers
pretty awesome
PERSONAAA@@@
Okay, I get it.
Also this is not anime crossover
Persona 3 is emo :P
jk
more like game crossover
eh i played persona 3 for like 2 hours then i just couldent play it anymore
Everything crossover.
never could get into it
Remember guys, Atlus=balls hard RPG
indeedd
never played
Years ago I never thought People will love Persona in the west.
naturesfury: I heard Persona 4s i better
I mean it has tons of religious stuff
*is
They afraid to offend people.
mehh ill just stick to the diagaea series
Java: PFFFFFT that series has a giant cock demon
It is.
That's why publishers scared to put it to the west.
Was
Still the anime power hour?
As in, not a demon with a giant wang, the wang IS the demon :D
XD
More like a marathon
And it's a recurring monster/boss
Mara is best pony
MadSurge: orly? :D
Keeps coming back :3
Gah, starting a 90 laps Laguna Seca endurance race. Why am I doing this to myself :(
It's name is Mara
GT5
naturesfury: yep :D its name is Mara
00,10cause Luguna seca is a fun track
a 3rd?

Too much turning X(
whats laguna seca?
OH COMEON
And I use a Ford GT40, that thing always understeer
I need to set the suspension to enduce more oversteer but I'm lazy
Is this a magical girl series or "bitch be stealing my magical girl job" series?
00,10Java cause you dont tap the brakes before you go to turn
00,10it's a mid engin rearwheel car
00,10you need weight on the tires to make them grip
Yeah, GT40 is like this Tsundere girl, need a lot of care handling.
00,10I love that one suzuiki that has two engines and 4 wheel drive
Yeesh, the Tsundere character is the one that bugs me the most :|
00,10the one with the giant fin used for rallycross
Supra twin turbo?
00,10yep
Oh wait that's Toyota....
00,10it's used in that pikes peak race

SuperBrony64: smart thinking :D

11,02Buytoast: No :<
I did that to that SEMA car. A Buick.
Shameful

my mother asked if i wantedd to see breaking dawn part 2.. :|
11,02I bought the World of Warcraft Battle Chest for $5 (includes Original, Burning Crusade, and Lich King), WoW Cataclysm for $10, and WoW Mists of Pandaria for $20 at GameStop o.o

Hi MadSurge =D
That's awesome aniderp

I'do rder from Hot Topic, if they didn't charge me $55 for shipping one item.
I'd order*
you mean 5 dollar?
Nop
$55
dif country?
Australia
I wonder if the pony hot topic of the week is out yet :D
oohhh
they got dashie headphones
i check the site constanly of ponies and zelda and some other things
valoreins|Drawing: oooh, you're GOOD. :O
:$
Jmo: That's fucking pathetic.
ikr
$55 in shipping.
dude its like free shipping for 30 dollar or more order
welovefine charges $40 in shipping
saleeee but
i cant buy no more stuff since its close to chirstmas
Welovefine/Hot Topic hates international shipping lel
;_;
no cash cards for me to order things online
XAX: thankfully I ran into a free shipping promotion on amazon to buy and send stuff to my secret Ponygoons santee
thing is.. when i ordered the blankey and other things.. it was like 25 percent off.. plus i had the 15 percent discount i could use
so mega sale when i had it!
blankey orginaly 24.50.. it saif 12.50 :>
a marceline plush for like 9 something,zelda beanie less also
wooo!
i hit good
dont you think?
You did indeed.
Hello everyone, whats going on today
MadSurge: Noice.
Allo Cypresswolf
Snow~ :3
not much Cypresswolf but how you doing
XAX: indeed :) I still wanna send him some coffee and a postcard too :D maybe some booze as well
ohai Cypresswolf
Alright - being lazy today - watching news feeds on people fighting over crap at the stores
Nothing much Cypresswolf :D
MadSurge: lel
Cypresswolf: that's not much, my news feed is full of people fighting over Israel-Palestine war stuff
and its annoying
I dont see the point in black friday - people buying stuff they already have to "save money" they could save better by not buying anything
yo guys mind i ask u question ?
Nop
pon
and its always electronic stuff, nothing important - now if they slashed the prices for food at the grocery store for a change, I'd stock up my freezer with all kinds of meat
even bacon?
Even Bacon
:3
I like Black Friday. I buy lots of video games then. :>
Gold_Demona: Yay, vidyas! :$
I was planning on going out tomorrow to see if I can finish The Hobbit figure collection....might wait another 2 weeks, the stores will still be crowded tomorrow
wen eps air they are livestreamed here at 2 or 230 am my time. this sunday ( my timezone) is the last ep ill be able to watch for a 4 weeks, now heres the question, should i actually get up for 1hr to see livestream which is probs 480 p or w8 till that arvo to watch in 1080p?
^ mah question
I stopped reading after wen.
Lollzzzz
i dunno lol
I do both, so I couldn't tell ya. :D
i prefer watching here with my lovely bronystate family <3
o u Jmo
o u Snow.
no u Jmo
time to pick the old fashion way, eeee knee miney mo
no me Snow
:>
the thing about black friday is stores could totaly lie about the price and savings, and make huge margins off of the percived reduction
but if silly people want to run around trampling people to buy things, thats their buisness
i'll be at home doing stuff
An Australian commenting on Black Friday.
AHAHAHAHAHA WAT.
Gold_Demona: this time I don't even know the synopsis of the episode, I can't wait to see what it's about :D
Jmo, we have the boxing day sales, but thats the closest thing i can think of
Yeah well that's Boxing Day :P
I don't actually go out on Black Friday. That'd be suicide. I shop on the internet.
murica?
Phase4, it's not common for stores to lie about the normal prices on Black Friday.
The deals on Black Friday are REALLY good
Things really are WAY cheaper than they normally are
lol
Yeah pretty much
Roll around giant balls of shopping
Kandarihu, from what i'm seeing that seems true
but still
Gold_Demona: likewise - besides, there's nothing special in the store today, that people couldnt have gotten yesterday
Jmo, we're not all like that.
I know Kandarihu :P
Cypresswolf: But yesterday it wasn't on sale
im back, internet died
Welcome back Snow :>
or at least chrome
I wonder I Toys R Us has those hobbit figures online....
Possible
ermagerd Hobbit movie next month
Eeeeeeeeee
APS Eeyup
Aaand we're not all willing to kill each other over deals. That's just a small HIGHLY visible minority of psychopaths who make the rest look bad.
rather buy them in store, avoid the shipping costs
Jmo: Ermagerd Herbbert merver nerxt mernth?
Yush
I love how it is being showed on my birthday ;_;
speaking of movies
anyone seen Paranormal Activity 4?
Gold_Demona: so how was Thanksgiving? :)
Milked series.
Should of ended at 3.
I hope there's better security in stores for that sort of behavior. When I was at Wal-Mart last night, there were security trucks in the parking lot but I didn't see a lot of security in the store.
MadSurge: It was delicious. My stomache was quite full by the end of the evening. :>
Jmo: that is my first and last Paranormal activity ill watch
maybe i get a mlp fim calendar for chirstmas!
MadSurge: I mostly hung out with my husband's cousins and watched Doctor Who. :D
Lawl
last year i got one :>
Nice aniderp
bye guys
Gold_Demona: :D did you visit his parents?
Which series Gold_Demona?
but i bought that one myself
Jmo: The new one. Season 7.
Egh. The disappointment series >.>
:3 I might go see a movie now - dont expect anyone to be at the theatre
MadSurge: Yeah, my mom's Colombian and doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving, so we go to his parents' house every year. :>
I shall drown Moffat when he comes to Austarlia.
Australia*
Gold_Demona: a big hug and regards is what your mom needs :)
YES! Red Dawn at 10:40 :)
Nah, not really. She just doesn't care. :D
Im hungry again - went out to eat buffet style at Houston Aqaurium yesterday - so much food ^_^
I think those desserts had lembas bits in them >_>
there was this chocolate mousse coconut cake ^_^ sugar comatose ready to happen
Gold_Demona: your mom must be fantastic though, look at her daughter! :3
MadSurge: LOL, I'm not that great. XP
Imma go get some berkferst
ermagerd berkferst

Man I love Miata, this car control like a dream.
The warner brothers, and sister, are way too wacky
Miata get a real car?

/me knows nothing about race cars
MadSurge: It's not a race car. :P
Miata is just a normal car.
:D
It's a little tiny car
It's only 120 hp
But it's a good car.
Perfect for a race then >_>
It is
lol, I highly doubt a Miata can reach racing speeds
can i have a car? :>

And there's actually a Miata endurance race.
LEFTOVERS

Bronysith: Truth!

That's genius.
CCCP: did it really take you that long to notice the saucy sexy parts?
No seriously, I'm seeing a twitch.tv stream.

Hi

hahahahah
The fact you find this humorous is proving that you'
you're a child*
...
i am very immature
yes i will admit
Clearly
I find this a bit ridiculous
we noticed...
pony_4124: "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" for A film and "Hulk Vs." as B film with "Look Before you Sleep" and "A Bird in the Hoof" as the pony episodes.
You aren't gonna last here.
but only because i like to mess about
d3rb: Yep. No.1 rule in Russia - FREAKING BE CAREFUL! 'cause at least one idiot on the road will not be driving by rules.
Theres,silly then,there is,stupid
Kammerjunk: Wtf??
pony_4124: Oh, you asked what movie night IS.
Hi VenHur
Well, it's a night where we watch films.
Kind of self-explanatory.
Why didnt i watch animaniacs when i was a kid
i saw it before but not this much
Hello everypony!
Kammerjunk: oh, ok. thanks.
JunkerKun: that's valid for Italy too :D
JunkerKun, you're in russia? Serriously, good luck dude, russians drive crazy
Star_Gazer: It was never on the channels I had when I was a kid.
Kammerjunk: it is really good
Hello Kammerjunk!
JunkerKun: that's valid everywhere

d3rb: You tell me -__-

MadSurge: Salve!
My-socks-fallen-off: You know, you can just use /nick to change name.

I think pony countdown is glitching
Oh guise btw Half Life Two has a release date

Oops
Two or 3?
both7
Actually not really
Hello you lovely people
3... Gabe leaned that from Engineer... you know sentry level 3 and stuff
whats for movie night tonight?
'Half-life 3 has a release date' And pigs can fly.
Hello everypony!
Jmo, I think you mean: Pigs can't fly.
Hi BronyDarth!
lol I read that name as BoulderDash... a staff member on a social site on Ibrony
Nope.
Hi Nick
Cause pigs can fly.,
Didnt you watch the two first episodes of season 2 Jmo?
howdy! CCCP
Sigh
leoulmemsos
reaching 10000 points on apptrailers is insane
What's this about a release date for Half Life 3?
Alot of bollocks.
video buffering?
Unless he has a source.
no just pressing +5 point videos over and over again
OH, okay. I missed the "Actually not really"
yo
yo weird name guy I'm afraid to write it down
Hi HOMOSEXUAL_EIFFEL_TO
troll xD
Gabe newell: Things like this takes time. Us: Well... Barack obama said the same thing.
supposed to be tower.. but well
I think this is how bronystate chat makes shizu feel sometimes http://i.imgur.com/coiIP.gif
Hi StarFox64
^
When I say "us" I mean "us" not United states
*^^
Bronystate, da monkey
better now xD
hi
Only shizu?
More like every streamer on Bronystate.
you mean Clopping Demo
＊ｇａｓｐ＊
Well Shizu is the most vocal about it from what I have seen
I only notice I guess cuase I like shizu so much.
08,01my god
Such a fun streamer XD
/me gasps because Nick doesnt know how to gasp
08,01so i just did a massive faux pas
Slurp slurp.
And then my other favorite walks in.
08,01i was telling my friends in a lab about my heroin story
Gulp.
Well Obama's stalling for time because his policies don't work in practice. Gabe Newell is just taking his time so that his game will be good.
I cant wait until tommorow...
...
PONY EPISODE!!
I FORGOT!!
Gawd... I just made a concept for a crossover with Inception. I am crazy
o.o hi I'm Mongolian most probably the only Mongolian brony you'll meet
And I am idiot
yelling. sorry. Thanksgiving.
08,01and i said "so i felt like a proper businessman getting high on heroin in a bathroom stall while wearing a suit"
Barb|Lappy, RAWR! PONIES!
08,01right as one of my module coordinators was standing behind me
Hi urinal
hey who wants to watch PPG movie with me after this?
People at school calls me insane, someone said that Ponies and horses arent the same, its like saying A and I isn't letters.
08,01who i'd just a meeting with
hey CCP
08,01and she'd mentioned about my late coursework
I gotta go :/
08,01so now i think she thinks that all my late coursework is because i'm a junkie
cya bronehdarth
Lol..worst timing
08,01and i'm not quite sure how to approach her and say that she heard what she heard out of context
08,01because i'm trying to appeal lateness grading based on my diagnosis of ADHD
08,01nota bene: i'm still wearing a suit
;o
08,01cowvarkian: i was thinking about it, but i've decided not to
ok
08,01too risky
that's probably for the better
nobody wants a strung out gas giant
I see what you dd there
Wait, why would you even think of using heroin?
Hi person that just joined
Cause it must have felt good jaymoo
heroin is bad. and hi again lol
That is a serious question d3rb.
When you consider using drugs you really better have a decent excuse.
Why doesn't some one start to cook meth?
Thats a serrious answer, people dont get into drugs because they feel crap to use
Jmo: because last night he was in a train station bathroom next to someone who was smoking heroin
CCCP: it isnt easy to cook meth, sure it is basic chemistry, but the process is very fucking dangerous
We need Walter White
Sorry jmo, im putting my nose where it shouldnt be
It's fine d3rb.
CCCP: walter from fringe?
You aren't in the wrong, you just added your opinion.
walter from breaking bad
I have a bad habit of buting in out of turn lol
gayniggers: no from breaking bad
one fuck up in making meth and take it away demoman "KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM"
aok. :p
:o
I think he said he wasn't going to do that
fuqing autokick
ffs
Im back.
:I
back in black?
or whatever it is
No..
Im white
Why not
Racist
...
Implying he meant skin colour, niice.
Just because I am white dosn't make me racist.
what have I done ._.
gayniggers is your name inspired by that movie?
Someone needs to stream...

AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/68aac7ab505d5d7b09033e312a7c4892.png AJ, you got a problem D:
cowvarkian: die in a fire
Star_Gazer: I probably will
Batman TAS was good but it's not one of the best
MadSurge: AJ, get some help. :D
Zamer: die
Oi
Batman TAS is the best animated show ever
Freakazoid Pinkie in the Brain, Biker Mice from Mars, TMNT
Quit hating on people cause they don't have the same opinion to you.
Star_Gazer: I agree with those, but gargoyles is one of the best

oh!
It looks good, but nothing beats the premiere
sombra was amazing, truly my favourite villain
thevoidspawnpony: mhmhmrrrrrhhhh... slave... brgh
thevoidspawnpony: not my favorite, but I wanna see where they go with him :)
his horn was okay he could come back
Sombra was a bland villain that does nothing but taking over the Crystal Empire...
No backstory, no nothing.
Chrysalis had none either
Dark92Enigma: Yay! :D
huh Dark92Enigma i don't get that referance
I dunno, should it be like this wrek? http://gyazo.com/7a988c80c74ffa5e829763409a62bde6
VenHur: they do explain SOME things about him, but not enough backstory
Too many pinkies reminded me of calvin and hobbes
alexxm: it's a famous saying in my country
back
ah ok Dark92Enigma
... so hawt http://i.imgur.com/ym5yh.jpg
hi everypony
Too many pinkies reminded me of calvin and hobbes
thevoidspawnpony: only they weren't imaginative
and sombra was just makuta
imaginary*
Barb|Lappy: DAT KITTY :D
from bionicle
thevoidspawnpony: only that they weren't IMAGINARY

Hi, wipergone2. :)

^_^
;P
:P
¬_¬
XD
D.D
how are things wipergone2
O-O
OyO
good
hey...
i just realised something
PONIES
^
wrek
VenHur: for example, we know he's been King of the Crystal Empire, we know that he can disable unicorns with ''herpes'', we know he feeds off the bad feelings, and that he uses that Oesed Mirror-like door to reveal everypony's worst fears.......but then again, just like in ''Quest For Camelot'' it wasn't developed or explained very well
points if you know where the Oesed Mirror comes from
hey everyone
Dark92Enigma: I feel we haven't seen the last of Sombra though
Hi, Madviking. :)
Agreed, MadSurge.
hey aj :)
Hoy Madviking!
Oh hai mark
Oh god this song/
hey.....fellow Mad
MadSurge: true, he can either come back in the season finale, or the comics
Madviking: indeed :D
lololol :D
Could you please play some Boston. Something about you. if thats ok with you
only reason why Sombra should win Worst Villian is because he lost to a baby dragon
(,_') is shure dew luv pwniez http://i.imgur.com/QtCSQ.gif
outside defeat he was good
And an Alicorn.
Zamer: lolol
i see movement
And an entire Crystal Empire, as well.
Hell yes
Barb|Lappy Hey I didn't know you wrote fanfics
i think he might be a throught the season villain, you know like an overlaying plot?
horse x horse
horse x horse x otakon
no
MadSurge: I see what you mean, like the entire season being one epic saga?
* Madviking
I see something moving
exactly like he might manipulate people or something
buffering
Like
In the bottom left
05aaaand back
(i think)
yay
05lets get this show on a roll
I think that as well AJIsAwesome :D
Likeafrigginboss
Sorry, MadSurge. :D
wrek
like maybe he gives trixie power in return for revenge or something ya know?
g
AJIsAwesome: of what? It's a good guessing! :D
hello wrek
MadSurge: Okay. :D
water go downt he HOOOOOOOLe
05hope the new addition to the megametalist are enjoyable :3
I doubt that's the real pewdie

05mega metal list
05but in one word

Madviking: you mean a season-long story arc?
Madviking: ALL OF MY YES

05ahem

Pick a nick and stick with it, Pewdiepie.

05no discussion of unaired eps

hey, maybe he could have more screen time then a commercial...
wont happen again
:P
05currently waitign for sumica
i did then the battery died and i couldn;t remember what i used
will there be a season 4
Yes.
Pewdiepie: Then think of a new nick?
Don't spoil please.........don't make the same mistake as i did
They confirmed it.
wipergone2: Pretty sure there will be.
wipergone2: YES!
YAY
00,10start with out me wrek
Who the hell would want a name like Pewdiepie.
Jesus.
i shall join you Wrek in a moment

Madviking: Me too =(

Madviking: Though I was able to set it up so it could run with about 30 FPS
Mfw people cant run sims 3 :|
JunkerKun: mine could barely get passed 14
Back.
I don't even like the sims.
my specs can run sims 3
my laptop is very slow
Madviking: Well, I always have DOTA2 =D in that cases
your lucky to even have that JunkerKun
My laptop is a retard.
best i can MAYBE do is toribash
Madviking: Hey, Toribash is a cool game too =)
a laptop doesnt have a brain. so how can it be an idiot
Wrek: watch out for that turtle shell
ya ill give ya that JunkerKun
Bloons is the best game evar!

Madviking: :D
STOP being a noob
Kawaii_icybeauti: so how are things?
Damn... it's been nearly a year since i was here last...
/me drinks dr.pepper
fefaq is this
Planetside 2.
lol this game is so glitchy
is this mmo
The person playing it seems to be terrible at it :P
08,01if i was a failure, would you all hate me?
bout i get plane so i get blowed up
no
No
great idea
PPFFFFTTT
nooope
i suck at ps2
/me 08,01is in danger of failing his degree because his ADHD got the better of him on a couple of courseworks this semester
08,01i'm so worried
Where is the episode ?
08,01i'm in abject terror that i'll fail out
oh, that sucks- I hope it works out
08,01i can't sleep because of it
yuo can't do anything extra to make up for it?
What is 'it'?
Gosh darn it, is it the Crystal Empire :P?
will it get optmized for lower end
08,01Vivix: nope
08,01Zamer: i've e-mailed just now
Well, I can do is wish you good luck~~
What is going on :P
will planetside 2 get optimized for lower ends?
08,01i didn't have the courage to before, because i *hate* getting special dispensation because of my ADHD
08,01i really hate talking about it to teachers/lecturers/bosses too
My teacher used to tell me to go outside and have a run- yeah
I got aspergers and ADHD
what about the possibility of making a A on the final?
ty
08,01i was only diagnosed about 4 years ago when i was 21
EAT IT.
I was diagnosed when I was 7 I think
08,01and i was on medication for a while, but they can't prescribe it in scotland
gotta love that ridilin
Concerta?
08,01aye
I take concerta
08,01concerta XL
08,01the slow release version
i literally refused to take it when i was a kid
Concerta worked for me for a while, but it made me calm and shy, more so-
:|
08,01today was a terrible day for ADHD for me
so we opted to stop taking it
I've had ADHD since I was 3 (14 now), I haven't taken any medications. I'm fine
08,01because i've not slept much
(i think)
>.<
HavokOC, yeah, some people don't need the medication, some do~~ it's a huge umbrella term
LALALALALA im bvack
08,01i had to fill in a simple ticky box questionairre about my module
08,01and i couldn't do it because i couldn't read the damn questions
08,01because i couldn't focus on it
Well. That really sucks.
this planetside 2
08,01i'm getting more and more convinced that ADHD is a language processing disorder more than anything
i want to play alien swarm :/
08,01i'm like tthat with speech too
well that would make sense
08,01i usually just lie and say to people i'm partially deaf
08,01because it's easier to explain
08,01but i really have trouble understanding people when they're talking and other noise is going on
08,01especically with that other noise is speech
08,01
ADHD is complicated- my diagnosis goes out on concentration, not so much anything else
so i can shoot guys miles away
08,01the hyperactive part of my ADHD has actually been much less in recent years
yeah, I hate being in cantines or places with tons of people, I can usually concentrate there, but sometimes it just sounds like all the noise comes in one huge wave
08,01i used to be completely bouncing off the walls at times
Well, that's good.
08,01literally jumping across couches with boundless energy
That's good.
08,01Vivix: do you hyperfocus?
It is indeed- doctors used to say ADHD is outgrown, but recent studies say that it does not, but it changes nature as you age
i had a friend like that once when i was 5 his dad literally had to drag him out of my house XD
08,01the things i hyperfocus on are computers and music; surprise surprise, those are the things i'm best at
Why are the streams almost always about video games?
go home BaconMane you're drunk
Oh boy here we go.
hehe, yeah I think so, but all my symptomes are pretty mild nowadays
FlyingToaster: -in alien pose- Mods.
Kay
08,01it's odd, because though i have toruble picking out and understanding individual voices with noises going on, i can separate out orchestral music in my head, really really easily
08,01any music, really
I haven't had a new diagnosis, so I don't know how much it's changed, but I am calm, but unfocused and stuff
So I guess you get a benefit from that
0,5AM NOT!
It's really hard to do music
ARE TOO!
Imaigne, being able to seperate all the insturments from a song....I try to do that all the time, never works.
Go home, BaconMane. You're sober.
yeah, music and art is probably one of my focuses
I can seperate almost all instruments in most songs, but that'
Hey guys. Heya Wrek!
s somethign you can learn
AJIsAwesome: :D
damn this game looks alot better on his computer lol
GO home, BaconMane. You're dreaming

Hello AssaultWithEmbraces :)
hui
08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: my mutant superpower is being able to hear a song, pick out all the parts, and play them separately or together on a piano
hi
I play by ear whenever I'm in orchestra though, even thoguh I have to plays second violin, I always end up playing the 1st part sicne I can hear it better.
my planet side sucks it crashes and the graghics are horrible lol
08,01MadSurge: aye, exactly
08,01i'm like that
is it me or does the pistol seem more op than the rifle?
Vivix: I'm in an apartment block at the second floor, it's hard for her to climb that high :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Album Compilation - November
MadSurge, hehe, imagine if she did- heartattack
There's this house not far from here, where they made a ramp for their cat to the second floor
Vivix: superkitty! :D

08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: more like i can hear everything that's said, i just can't understand it. it's like they're speaking a foreing language
Hai thelonepony|BL2 :)

08,01*foreign
Hi MLP_Brovakiin :)
o wait im dumb its his name
No, I'm very good at picking individual voices in a croud (when I wanna hear someone in particular)
hi surge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One of the forms of ADHD has something that makes it difficult to seperate voices or sounds
or rather, to block things out
so in a crowd it's like you hear everyone at once
Hi Professor!
I don't have that very strong, but that's one of the things that was described to me
damn his graghics are good lol
It's really funny, I'm at my abulita's hosue, and my mom is speaking to everyone, and I'm just sitting there going "WTF"

There doesnt have to be an obscene amount of dialogue for the series to be great.
PICK UP THE PHONE
Or, doesn't speak to himself at all in a situation like this.. Most cartoons end up with the main character talking to himself when he is alone.. A lot.

SpadeMagnes[School]: Roger Rabbit and Hulk Vs
Alchemist: Seriously? You guys checked every scene?
Wrek: Indeed
Gah! why is drawing hands so difficulst?!
because there<s so many curved lines
Pfft, You wanna have the same fav. pony as Hitler? Not me.
So how did Derpy origionate? Was it a animation goof?
:S
Spade I personally checked ep1 and 2 almost frame by frame, didnt do it for ep3 though, but she wasnt found yet as far as I know.
Dovah: because hands are complicated
Alchemist: Not sure if I should be concerned you did that
I got one hand done... too loke 20 min :|
like*
Alchemist: Season 3 Derpy'?
i like more the paper than the computers to draw
Dovah: What are you drawing?
SpadeMagnes[School]: it doesnt take that much time
ow
Derpy was originally a animation goof they left in right?
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/2b16ff54c71f545d436ab5868001bc13.jpg HUMAN PONIES :O
game streams
kristelsouthpark1: ever seen Fairy Tail?
SpadeMagnes[School]: apparently yes
Dovah: never seen it, but heard of it
Vordox: yes. and confirmed ones, not the ones where you cant see either the cutie mark/wings/eyes.
kristelsouthpark1: I am drawing Erza from that.
Alchemist: She has been seen once with almost 100% chance
Alchemist: But only once
Dovah: I'll google to see
Vrodoxat the jousting scene?
as i had heard they intentionally made derpy's eyes like that but we werent actually supposed to see her
oh i hate that
So why was the Crystal empire gone for 1000 years?
no idea
dat pinkie face
because of reasons
wait
em
Dovah: Oh my gosh, that must be really hard to draw!
Couldent they have just banished Sombra and not the whole damn kingdom?
:O
kristelsouthpark1: just a bit
how many year was luna suppose to be on the moon?
meleeman: 1000
13two
Wreky voice! \:3/
which is why its so god damn confusing
13canary canary!
and the crystal empire?
Alot of shit happened 1000 years ago
13three
Shizu Shizu /)^3^(\
King Sombra cursed the Empire before being banished
meleeman: 1000 agan
whats the name of the game your playing there?
WHAT
THE SHIT
wut
lol
wut
O_o
DAMN IT PINKIE
SpadeMagnes[School]: 1000 confirmed to be an arbitrary number
Im not sure...was it speficly said how long ago Discord was sealed away?
what did pinkie do?
kristelsouthpark1: also, the picture i assume you saw when you looked up erza, I am NOT drawing that one, at least not yet :P
soo the next day they save the crystal empire they banished her to the oon?
moon?
Was it a century or something?
meleeman: more like take one year/decade or two
Dovah: Oh haha, well if I can't see it. I can always wish you luck
Was it ever said how long ago Dscord was first sealed away?
Dovah: In the netherlands we say: "Succes!" when we mean: "Good luck!
"
13yes we've already been through the problems with the chronology, crystal empire is banished before nightmare moon, but nightmare moon comes back first, both with a stated time of 1000 years
*Discord
13discord wasn't specified
^
kristelsouthpark1: well I will Succeed!!
soo
I'm pretty sure 1000 years is just a round about number..
I wouldent have a problem with the 1000 years thing if we had some time line, I mean jesus Celestia had a busy year 1000 years ago
Dovah: yay~
all those things happen in the century?
or its like 1. save the crystal empire
Pew pew pew
Wrek: ill be joining momentarily
WHAT SERVER?! :D
So what the hell did Sombra even DO to the empire that Celestia and Luna couldent fix?
2 century banish of nightmare moon
woooo!

SpadeMagnes[School]: sometimes?
I mean they're afraid of a fucking zebra because she isnt a pony
Racists...

Now, what game is this?
SafariMonkey: Not sure :o
weeping_pegasi82: my mom made applepie :)
MadSurge: but anyway, even if it's fiction, it reminded me of how many pets i've lost, each depature more heartbreaking than the last
BronyDarth: I c

The fuck went wrong here?
I dont cry tears of sentiment anymore. This would make me sad, but all it does is make me angry.

Dark92Enigma: Lulu's face is too dumb, can't feel bad about it :D

Spamish2: There is no best pony.
DoctoDoctorWho, for fun?
Owlicious
My favorite is Dash
LadyCanary: Good response !
Mine's Angel.
well that sucks
LadyCanary: only personal favorites :)
angel salps fluttershy
why!?
So just saying for x pony, sweet thing. for fun?
?
well
I like Angel. He can be cute when he's patient, and he might be kinder than you think.
For the main 6, Sweet things
If only this game was for PS3.
wow no action yet
I hate Angel.
KTKomedy2813: But Angel seems not totaly nice i think
no one who makes fluttershy cry deserv to live anymore
Yeah
He threw fluttershy out of the house just because of a berry missing from some ice cream.
XD the guy got ran over
hi
Over a BERRY.
Yeah that's why
poor dude on the quad
SHOOT HIM BACK!
OVER A FUCKING BERRY
Hello Everyone :3
Hi
Hi SkunkTari
ShunkTari: Hi
KILL THE DOUCHE! (that was referring to earlier in the game)
I think angel is like pinkie, He has a good and evil side.
how've you been SkunkTari
alexxm: i have been alright :3
PlanetSide 2 needs to be for PS3.
never,but NEVER compare PINKIE with someone!
Okay, Angel IS impatient at times, but lately, he's been showing a sweeter side.
What about Gilda? She's a dick.
The Great And Powerful Trixie!
Trixie is fine.
Gilda is just a jerk sammich covered in jerk sauce.
what about discord?
whats going on in here?
Discord kicks ass.
Discord isn't rude.
discord is just discord
yeah
But Discord's cool. @P3819
fair enough
At least trixie can show a good side.
He is the spirit OF CHOAS
Trixie might be misunderstood.
I hope that Trixie has a bad past, that would explain everything.
Discord never hurt anypony
lets see that in the new episode
Nightmare Moon ( i guess)
if she have a good side
or something
Roof douche! Tree douche! Point A douche! Nice douche! Thing douche! ... (pauses) Douche douche!
welp
Princess Trollestia.
oh god
Maybe trixie's friends left her because she was starting to become a show off due to this bully.
Gummy
she is the real troll
can we stop with the talk of Season 3 spoilers?
we'll see in the new episode
DOUCHE ARMY AHOY!
She doesnt need a bad past, her talent is being a large ham and a showpony. She simply got carried away is all.
Everyone hates a bully
Hi everybody.
Red = Douche, and Blue = ...Not Douche
hi
run Meanwhile! run while you still have the chance!
Oh, hi, IF.
hello
hey Meanwhile
Holy crap, did i start a war? *grabs popcorn*
You startin' Shammy?
Meanwhile: no the chat is

Pika-Picho: whats it about?
PM.

im back
So, Here is my first attempt at an actual non stick figure drawing in, well ever really. http://i.imgur.com/w3FhT.jpg?1
See Pika-Picho next to bronystate?
DoctoDoctorWho: it means ''what the masses think about the plot of a show'' like Trixie here, we're discussing her ''possible origin''
Dovah: not bad, not bad! :O
Dovah thats great for first attempt :) keep it up!
Yay thanks :)
Dovah: better than anything i could ever hope to draw
Dovah: very very good, mate!
I know this is free to play, but I wonder if it's compatible with PC game controllers.
Dovah: Not but but i don't like this face :(
;)marshmellows
Hey bronies guess what happens in the new episode tomorrow? STUFF!
Not bad*
Dovah: so you actually can draw when you get off your lasy ass, I was starting to think it was a bluff. http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg
SHOOTING DOUCHES OUT OF THE SKY IS FUN!
Dovah: you're even more detailed than i am
lol told you DoctoDoctorWho :P
STUFF is best spoiler
therefore it's still a SPOILER
For Season 3,sweet thing.
For KITTEH, cute thing
For Pinkie Pie, fun thing :D
Eventually, I will draw artorias, from dark souls
Hey guys guess what I'm doing!

Sketch_Toku_Brony: (\
by the way, i got my copy of Assassin's Creed 3 Wednesday!
FlutterMEDIC: tiem to kill british
cachi01|Blackcops2: yesh
Zamer have you heard of the unleshead porting project for generations pc?
yay 11% downloaded!
cachi01|Blackcops2: and germans
the what GyrmShip?
That project alone makes it worth it on pc
Zamer: A wise man once said, "Platformers + PC = not good"
cachi01|Blackcops2 = My brain is simple, stop confusing it 6_9
lol k

pc exclusive*
A group on some sonic forums started porting the original tracks from sonic unleashead on to sonic generations.It's awesome

*for
Not sure.I'll look it up
Personally, I want to play a game where campaign and online multiplayer come together containing full voice acting and cinematic set pieces mixed with the awesomeness of fucking shit up with your pals and miscellaneous losers you don't know. Who agrees with me?
right now I'm trying to correct the Audio/Video sync
KTKomedy2813: im not sonic
im my original character
blonic
I didn't say Sonic.
FlutterMEDIC: yeah my nephew played and said it confused him :D sounds like itll be fun!...still need to get my copy though :$

Colornic,
Mylittleponynic
FlutterMEDIC: :D man now i want it even more~ :D
Rose`: are you here?
Nic.
my only two complaints though for Sonic Generations is that it literally requires a controller and the audio/video sync issue
which supposedly there's a fix for
Discord fucked up a tank in the game.
werehog = manhog not wolfhog so HA FAIL SEGA
Sketch_Toku_Brony: the amount of collectibles is INSANE. the death animations for every class is brutal, and just everything is awesome
I never had the audio/video sync problem personally.And I use a cheapo controller I bought for lçike 10 bucks
*like
FlutterMEDIC: :O so awesome~ /)^3^(\

Hello, my oh so awesome friends! What the game playing right now? :)
This is one of 1000 reason I don't play shooters... (Don't worry, it's not because I think they're bad, I save that opinion for specific games)...
