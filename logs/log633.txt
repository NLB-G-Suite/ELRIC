good evening
Photoshop is very expensive, and not really direceted at the drawing crowd
i use ginp
lol thx
gimp
I dont know how to draw!
I don't like paint.net because none of my controls work on it
cltr-alt-space and shuch-
I write and act. I don't draw.
I can draw, but not very well......:(
^
I write more
*but
anything I do draw isn't anything fanceh
Honestly, MS Paint is usually fine for me :)
you could probably find a plugin that adds those shortcuts
/me sigh...

I also dislike being poked and then the person not following through
this looks like tron all of a sudden
Vivix:Vyranis isn't marked AFK on the /whois, and I haven't heard from her/him in a moment
seeya
6I must look pretty random with a toothpick in my hand..
I've never seen him before
>_<
DAMMIT
hehe
woa is this Tron?
i have mint flavored toothpicks :o
Its Mron!
brb

he should be in spaec
heya Saturn
hey
Heh, you can /query yourself :P
08,01gotta go to spaec
haha
Saturn not much to see, mostly empty. I suggest you visit Luna on the moon. She's really nice if you stay away from her toaster.
or look at it
6:O

Alright I just took a shower
I'm back :)
It's infectious...
Saturn: ................
08,01and had becomepregnant
:o
Saturn there's a fic about that already
6D:
08,01assumingthat changlelings and ponies can breed
O_O
Saturn: Reasonable assumption
Saturn: The baby would be the most adorable chest-burster ever?
lol
08,01well, i think changelings either descnended fromponies, or at least shared a common ancestor
Saturn I though they would just suck up their "Love" and then kill them withou having to mate :/
Well, physiological compatability between ponies and changlings aren't canon.
:(
which would**
...maaaaabyyyy
i would die if you did that :P
Saturn well, I wass just assuming things I actually saw in the ep XD ... and well... after that... maybe as an Ultimate Weapon to consume the rest of the World
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: óoooooooo
Like maybe during a boss battle or something
ya haha
Never watched the Valentine's day ep
08,01aye

now they're changelings

CMC messed up by trying to do a favor for cherilee and now they have to fix it
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9kzx4FUCg1qcxcjfo1_500.jpg
Oh my
Cheerilees face in that episode, is amazing, when the CMC first start bugigng her
Powerpuff girls
Powerpuff Girl?
ok
yeah
XD
Powerpuff Girls
in the song she says "In my heart there is no room" so-- either she loves someone, her hive or otherwise, or she can't feel it
*as a form of consumption*
I'd say she really didnt care at all regardless if she could
Well she IS a queen
eloo
It must be pretty nasty in there
I think Crysalis loves herself too much for there to be room in her heart
hehe
Never tell me the odds
Well, technically she would have to have a certain feeling for her subjects becuase if she didn't care about them she never would've found food for them in the first place. She would've only found food for herself.
Yes
hey everypony
hey!

Atheism = the belief that there are no deities
Tell me Khan, does it cut to something else, tell me something!
Atheism =/= the belief that the only things that are real are those which can be empirically measured

Usually helping people in 3rd world countries
everytime i see this http://three-sigma.blogspot.com/2011/07/lets-see-what-weve-got.html
Because that's how society views it
Uh...
Lolwut
i didnt link correctly.
ignore
k
WTF we watching?
00,03We ain't watching ponies~
LETS WATCH MOAR PONIES!
00,03No.
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SHOOOWDOWN
And again
You said that, not me.
Hey everypony! :) Whos streaming and whatre we watching?
But what's socially acceptable, what's good, what's bad, that does come from society
aw I remember this man :(
That's how it is
Nothing is inherently 'good' or 'bad'
no one type
SADFACE
We had slaves in this country at one point, and everyone was fine with it, it wasn't bad.
shit
Society's view on it changed
And it became 'bad'
right in my feels :(
00,03wow... that WAS ten seconds..
I counted :3
That's just how things work.
I counted too
I really want scary tuff :)
Awww <3
It isn't some view that I hold
How am I saying that?
boy you jsut keep asserting yiou're right don;t you
Wut
What's this?
Le.wild.music vid
HURT
by Nine Inch Nails
as performed by Johny Cash
GET THIS MAN A PLASTER
song name?
plz?
DANM
Because it's clearly bullshit
Cool song is cool
yeah, rogers 4ever
to sound important
Empire of dirt?
You can't 'reason' that "nothing has meaning"
That doesn't make any sense
00,03Johnny Cash's version of Hurt
k
^ yo dawg
11,02Atheism is just the abscence in belief of an all-mighty being, not the absence of belief.
this song
WHY DOES HE WANT AN EMPIRE OF DIRT?!
Not truth?
delusion*
chills
"Through the Wormhole Season 3 Episode 10: Did We Invent God?"
I go off, shower and eat some after-workout ice cream and you guys are still talking religion
theological
you did you stupid fucker
I thought that kid was peeing at first
Because I say that's a stupid argument
^^^
is this a Coldplay song?
/me stays out of this religon talk
I just dont think you give a good argument for "Why" to these things and just run on assumptions.
Opinions are over rated.
*slowly backs aqay from the argument*
I just like to have a good idea of how things factually work.
You're basically saying that anything we've 'made up' is a delusion
And therefore "isn't real"
I don't get this...
Assuming a fully materialistic world, then yes.
And then we changed the subject and didn't talk about this anymore. Kay? :)
We made up names for everything, language. The fact that these things also hold meaning to us must be "delusion" to you also then.
lol
That would have saved a lot of time and pain, wouldn't it
:P
war on terror
idk haha i dont even know if ive watched the movie :P
But that's a stupid argument
DIRTY MUSLIM TURRISTS
jews?
That's just an argument for argument's sake
Because the words clearly do have meaning to me
bunny1
ohey Bunnies
How dare you still argue against Rex "King of the World" Mundi! Don't you know his word is automatically truth?
Guys, BUNNIES. Look at all of these BUNNIES! :D

IMO wars were made for countries to boost their economies
