ikr, google needs to get their shit together and fix youtube
RosePetal1: A Movie, Old Batman movie. B Movie, was starshiptroopers, but it got changed to the Blues Brothers. Pony episodes were Boast Busters and.... I dont remember.
Ok then.

Fall Weather Friends

DAMMIT

Boast Busters? I won!
And then when it just ends the video in the middle and you have to refresh to get it to load the rest of the video
*Applejack2012
I don't think I missed Starship Troopers
Vivix: Or someone who voted for Trixie as well
-dying whale noise-

I am a Pony not a brony (i told me secret :( )
So Boast Busters won?

Hey guys. Who's streaming?
Wrek: Hence the love from everypony. :P
Obsidian: Sumi, of course
Obsidian: Sumica is.

hi
CCCP: HI!

Hi CCCP
Hello CCCP
Wb CCCP!
Hai CCCP
6Still,the huge stuff gave me headache until I got used to it..then it seemed really weird when everything was back to normal again :P
/me revokes all glomps, past and present, inadvertently directed toward Sir Wrek :)
hi HoodyNinja Applejack2012 FlutterMEDIC Pikachu Obsidian MadSurge PillowPoni|Lurking :)
Sup SSSR :)
what, no hi's for me?
Oh Hello FlutterMEDIC
CCCP: Hello!
FlutterMEDIC: I thought you were already here :)
FlutterMEDIC: Wb!
hai CCCP
hello tSparx|BnF :) and AJIsAwesome
i left awhile ago
hey thelonepony!
hi flutter
so was that an intentional backflip or did the mine blast you back to do that?
i still love that little thing i found on a website
you guys want to see it?
Maybe, what is it?
o30
it involves Ponies
meep
I hope paintool is free :l
yeah haha, same thing happened to me when i looked at my phone. im like "why is the quality so good? lol"
moop
Pikachu, it is not, but it is cheap. 70 bucks
hi al
hi RainbowDash90
Hello RainbowDash90
05Pikachu: it isnt
05but its cheap for drawing software standards
6xD
how you doing RainbowDash90
0560ish bucks iirc
that is cheap
when the alternative is Photoshop in the 300+ range?
go here: http://www.railslove.com/ then press: Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Enter (the Konami Code) for a surprise
it is
yeah, i'd say so
good evening
Photoshop is very expensive, and not really direceted at the drawing crowd
Well thats alot of money for me O_o hmm i dont care i still going to have 200 bucks on meh b day XD
im tired but ok alex
6I hope you can get it fixed so you won't need safe mode anymore x)
Painter 11 is directed at same crowd as Painttool, and costs--350 or osmething
There's also GIMP, which I know isn't perfect, but has been used to produce some wonderful art
i use ginp
lol thx
gimp
tSparx|BnF - i prefer Paint.NET personally
yeah there's good free stuff
I dont know how to draw!
I don't like paint.net because none of my controls work on it
cltr-alt-space and shuch-
what controls?
MirrorImage: That's a good alternative too. I don't do much stuff in the visual arts, and GIMP is more than sufficient for me :)
I write and act. I don't draw.
I can draw, but not very well......:(
Tsparx: good i have gmip on my computor wich has a mic bbut im tool lazy to swicht computor :l ill just download it
^
zoom rotate move stuff shortcuts
I write more
damnit AJIsAwesome
*but
anything I do draw isn't anything fanceh
Honestly, MS Paint is usually fine for me :)
you could probably find a plugin that adds those shortcuts
HoodyNinja: What is it?
/me sigh...
nothing
MirrorImage, maybe- I only use paint.net when I need to edit images now, and paint tool or Animate 2 otherwise
I love to sing but im shy in front of my mom and dad so i guess im going to be a fluttershy
do you guys want to see what i was talking about?
"oo, money"
HoodyNinja: No really, what is it?
OPPAN GANGNAM STYLE
I'm shy too, but I can stand on a stage
somehow
/me cant sing
/me is talentless
I write, I sing, and I act.
aw shucks I'm not into speeches
the grey man got shibaru
6D:
im singing right now :)
and i lost the game
err, type rather
cant sing tpoo

I like--everything, I don't act but I like that too, but I prefer working with music
Hello people :)
I sing like Scootaloo
hiya MLP_Brovakiin
Hello MLP_Brovakiin
hi
I sing, I play instruments, I wirte sometimes, but I can't draw.
hi MLP_Brovakiin
sup MLP_Brovakiin
I hate writing with pen or pencil, but put a keyboard infront of me and I'm done in a second.
MLP_Brovakiin: Hello!
hi MLP_Brovakiin
hai MLP_Brovakiin
oww... they shot you in the back
Hi MLP_Brovakiin
I love writing with proper ink pens, but noone is able to read it afterwards
6I want a slushie.. ._.
/me writes like crazy old doctor
/me really wishes he could draw well.........
I can act, do comedy, and wite, but i havent done anything as far as the fanbase goes
drawing is fun, it just takes a lot of practice

It's about 1000 letters long
oh and hi Masdragonflare and robotdragon9
smo smo~
I want you guys to check out what I wrote
Masdragonflare: What a stupid thing, I can't believe some people put so much energy into dissing us. Like, why bother, just let us be. *shrug*
i just beat mass effect 2.....half of the people i cared about on my team died :'(
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K78UacLiJ5g&feature=related
I know right?
Look what I wrote
6I'm 95% sure I've come across a video showing this game,a long time ago :O
And tell me if you have any comments on it
That unallowed link.

(ps; I'm not advertising O:')
AJIsAwesome: Eh, Sumi's off right now, right?
We're not allowed to post any non-image links
AJIsAwesome: I'm not watching the stream.

He went to go do something.
Vivix: During streams.

Vivix: No one's streaming right now.

Aah
Vivix: Sumi left to go do something.

tSparx|Bnf Have you read it?
Okay

MirrorImage: I'm not watching the stream right now, so idk what's up. MIPS has been derping for me all weekend.
dat Sumi
inb4WOOAHspam
but yeah I don't comment because you can't change someones opinion that way, one on one conversation might, but not really--it's hard to change somesones opinion when they're not based on anything
Masdragonflare nice essay =)

Was it you who were getting new laptop for TF2?
6You? :P
05try*

Vivix: no, it's me who can't play TF2 on most days cause i'm on a laptop

6Heh,nice ^^
:c
>want to start playing again

Wrek I honestly don't know how much that is. I don't do heavy trading, but my friend does. He bought a S. Machina for 3 keys.
Ohai

Applejack2012: hi
EY Applejack2012
FlutterMEDIC how about chat jumps? You see 15 messages all at once.
It's weird how 360p youtube lags like hell, but when Sumica streams it almost never buffers
http://youtu.be/5EwYH9m_D_o Uhhh...
Canadian_Brony: nope, just the stream
k
WHY IS IT CUT SHORT???
its lagging at 360 for me too at streams
360 youtube lags for me all the time-
fluff and clutter
sounds like my roon

what is unusal haunted metal scrap?
lol is there any sound? cuz i cant hear it
6xDDD
brb, gotta go something.

/me bites his lower lip and starts doing the moonwalk in the center of the stage wearing 70s disco clothing with the strobe disco ball blinding the room and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb-EwykPTv8 blasting at full volume
This channel is sexy
Canadian_Brony: tnx
AppleDoom streams on no video links
hi AppleDoom. No non-pic links during stream please.
6Yeah :P

hi Vyranis
Vyranis: Hello.
Hello
whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat o-o
/me creates a stream from his body to the toilet
wut
wat.
*wat
AppleDashalso using /me like that to get attention can get you kicked
once my friend had wireless headphones for mumble, once he did not turn it off while at toilet
AppleDoom i mean't
the horror that was had was horror
6LOAD YOU SON OF A WAFFLE
what about trying to act like a mod when you're not, is THAT against da rules?
/me is having bad visions
AppleDash, it's normal to remind people of the rules here
AppleDoom: Impersonating a mod? No rules against that.
woops wrong ping
AppleDoom: I don't think :P
AppleDoom what about listening to the rules and don't be a douche
05yes there is
AppleDoom we're just notifying you so you don't get yourself kicked or banned
Why does it keep cutting it short? ;-;
05and AppleDoom: it is in fact common coutersy for the users of this chat to remidn otehr users when they tend to foget the smiplest of rules.
AppleDoom: But, the whole love & tolerance thing encourages *us* to warn everypony *before* mods have to get involved.
Wrek what vivix said reminding people as a user is ok but acting liek you got power then you are breaking the rules too
probably cuz youtubes retarded
also, have you read the rules yet AppleDoom? If not, please read them here http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
asdfghjkl
/me spreads his flankcheeks apart and farts directly into Killerpony's face
peace fags and fagettes
study them, follow them, live by them

Good riddance to that douche

That's the fastest rage I've seen on this place
hi DerpyMuffins. A jerk
Derpymuffins a user breaking the rules
AppleDoom got buttraged
05* AppleDoom spreads his flankcheeks
05this measn its free to isnert dick
Oke there we go, figured it out
Wrek: I didn't mean using colours or pretending that I am a mod. I meant like an impression :P
Wrek: :D
but he's probably dirty-
Wrek and it was directed at me,
:D
Wrek why why WHY did you have to say it again?
I need a bucket if this goes on
05hah
/me hands Canadian_Brony a bucket.
Pinkie Puke
Oh Wrek and your dirty jokes
lol
SHEPARD, Y U NO DANCE!?
thank you AJIsAwesome
Canadian_Brony: No problem.
Wrek why you make fun of Appledoom?
6Well..screw sync.. -.-
lol
hey
05becasue the fucker deserved it after the way he acted silly

hey
Wrek :( thats no nice
ello

lol
Barbetos hey
RainbowDash90: Hello.
CCCP: it is true though.
Wrek pretty much. If you really come in with the attitude and breaking several rules off the bat. you DESERVE it
Appledoom came in and instantly started trouble
good evening
obvious troll.
I honestly wasn't all that mad until the ragequit
tSparx the truth is a lie!
05CCCP y u no liek meeeh
Brad__ is obviously bad at trolling
yes
05u seem to qeustion erryting ah do
/me throws a muffin at Wrek
I don't think he was a troll, but- the behaviour was abhorrent anyway
Wrek :( oh i liek you...
sorry :s
/me abuses english
Vivix in simple he was being a douche
yeah
Im surprised theres not more trolls here or people causing problems.
Also anyone using fag as an insult is gonna raise my ire
Me too, but I'm happy about it
Brad__ why?
The amount of trolls on other places is so high, maybe they're just too young to know what Irc is
Yeah, from what I've seen the mods are pretty fast to kick anyone trolling
CCCP, bronys are kind of a magnet for trolls
alright, well i have work in a few minutes *sadface*
later folks
Vivix: I am amazed by the number of people on this channel who are younger than IRC :P
later MirrorImage
bai MirrorImage
MirrorImage: Have as much fun as possible :P
Hehe, yeah- there's quite a bit
Brad__ Bronies ARE troll
cya
trolls*
He reminded me of a guy I know at school. He thinks he's cool when he juts around sprouting horrible insults which I either easily counter or simply ignore.
back
05Brad__: thats becasue we are good at cleanign our trash
CCCP, LOL
05that and that its not that big of a site
Wrek, i can see that
The mods here are very competent compared to many I've seen
Wrek: Times like these make me really appreciate the good mod-age :)
08,01im a troll
i lost legion in the end :/
05tSparx: moddage or mod age as in time passing
I'm back
:3
WB Masdragonflare
hi Masdragonflare!
hey
WB Masdragonflare
Wrek: Moddagge, I guess. The act of y'all Moderating for us
08,01inddedd
Thanks guys :)
He's the token one
:3
I commented on another brony hater
Tara Strong is a better troll then half of the internet
oh well
6For the love of God.. -.-
brb getting some cider
Dat ominous music
the only mods or administrators i dont tolerate are childre or VERY immature/stupid ones.
so many trolls and not enough bridges
CCCP, thats true!
children*
CCCP: Ubertroll
I usually say trolls don't exist, but that might be a troll in itself in this silly internet lingo
FlutterMEDIC yeah i know how it feels.
Brad__ Petrified_Discord :D
Tara strong's twitter is a goldmine of awesomeness
http://youtu.be/ZFpPfw2xqpk There we go :3 Don't ask why I changed the picture lol
CCCP Tara Strong is better troll than the entire internet. She's the only troll out there who actually does it well.
Canadian_Brony i guess..
well thats all it is for me, a picture lol
I'd rather say she's teasing and tweaking
Vivix tried boring a troll to death? i did once the troll resorted to spamming a bit and all until i decided it was enough and called a mod
I think Tara is the only troll that we all love
XD
Seriously, just look at Tara's latest tweet about her "secret boyfriend." :P
Hehe, that's my usual approach, placant and polite, not contradicting him or her
"Maybe I could say it promotes butt tatoos, but... damnit!"
i got so much stream lag
did i miss some dumb fucker test too much patience?
Vivix that and i provide little to no information for the troll to use
im almost halfway done my jawbreaker :P
yeah
Buytoast: You did indeed.
Buytoast: Fortunately she or he left very quickly.
trying to debate with a troll is--futile, because even the troll don't believe what he himself say
CCCP Tara Strong is best troll
Dark92Enigma Tara strong is just Best _____ everything
I gots a question 'bout the stream . . . WTF is happening?!?!
Dat bass cannon
Shephard now has a Bass Cannon
commander pon3?
6I like it :3
The canon is cannon
lol
The cannon is canon
Cannon iff canon
:3
LAZAH
Nah, that doesn't work out.
8,05Vyranis: you poked me in pm and then ran away, what do you want?
Should I put up a download link?
New mod?
nope
who the he
Dusky you can't have color
Oy, brah
disable your colourscript dude!
hi Dusky . . . woah, you have colours.
that's mod only
6Why not? ^^
network admin
Ooh
I dislike colours though
oh damn you ponychat
Dusky you are fanceh.
He's a Server Admin.
I do admit those colors are fancy
BUFFER
I also dislike being poked and then the person not following through
I don't know if Vyranis is AFK or not, but he's been silent for a while
this looks like tron all of a sudden
Dusky went Rapidash
Vivix:Vyranis isn't marked AFK on the /whois, and I haven't heard from her/him in a moment
well im gonna leave now...see u all later
seeya robotdragon9
cya robotdragon9
robotdragon9: Bye.
seeya
By the way......alexxm i remembered the Pony episode b for movie night.....Fall Weather Friends
I have two theories: A) he suddenly went AFK B) something crashed on his end and Vyranis is just a ghost
6I must look pretty random with a toothpick in my hand..
thanks Dark92Enigma
hi alexxm
Canadian_Brony: or he pmed me and then ran away
I've never seen him before
>_<
how you doing Canadian_Brony
also, this is how I get away with colour: Overriding KICK from Sumica on Dusky in #bronystate
Dusky that is also a good theory
alexxm:
DAMMIT
hehe
woa is this Tron?
Nope!
alexxm I'm alright
i have mint flavored toothpicks :o
Its Mron!
hi CrimsonPhoenix. No, it's ME3

What does ME3 do in Tron
08,01hullo Dusky!

Woah, its dusky! Hiiiii Dusky!~

CrimsonPhoenix he's inside a network shooting viruses. Or some such bullshit, I don't know.
Hows life???
6I love singing when I'm home alone.. :3
Unnr|Gardening: it goes
Canadian_Brony: Why her toaster?
AJIsAwesome not sure. Just don't touch it.
Derpy just broke that space ship

Canadian_Brony: Ok.

Huh, well this is cool-looking
6:3
CCCP nah, if it were dead, I'd be a zomb-shit
not again
Alright I just took a shower
Zombie_Brony: Damnit
I'm back :)
It's infectious...
08,01so what if, right, chrysalis had had sex with shining armour
I feel tired
tZombie Hey! I was a zombie before you!
08,01and had becomepregnant
:o
Zombie_Brony: You must be a virusy zombie. Nothing I can do about it :P
6D:
same here haha, i was up till almost 3 talking to mayo :P
08,01assumingthat changlelings and ponies can breed
O_O
lol
tZombie sure there is! Change your nick.
/me is raised up by Jesus / whoever
I hope Mike lets me guest commentate... and soon .3.
Unnr|Gardening haha
Canadian_Brony: Phew, good call :)
08,01well, i think changelings either descnended fromponies, or at least shared a common ancestor
i hope so too
Canadian_Brony: If I'm ever stepping on the toes of your joke, lemme know and I'll back off :$
Well, physiological compatability between ponies and changlings aren't canon.
my headcanon on changelings is that they need to trap ponies in a chrysalis (you know the coccoon) in which you slowly corrupt them and transform them into changelings
tSparx I call my schtick either way
08,01Lil_B: maybe chrysalis' goal was also to produce a changeling unicorn hybrid?
:(
which would**
...maaaaabyyyy
I should tell him I love him like right in the middle of it all, at a point where it would be difficult to edit out xD
i would die if you did that :P
and also about chrysalis origin I'll say that story in heart's and hooves day might be linked
Canadian_Brony: Okedy dokedy :) I understand that, my dad's the same way: "Don't get in the way of my joke!" Haha
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: óoooooooo
Like maybe during a boss battle or something
08,01now thats a fun possibility, with the hearts and hooves
-boss comes up- I LOVE YOU, MIKE!!!!
ya haha
Never watched the Valentine's day ep
with the love poison and all
08,01aye
that kingdom that fell
now they're changelings
ah yes
That sounds cool CrimsonPhoenix
its a must see
tSparx: You're not really missing out.
Wait, love poison? That sounds AWESOME
... that sounds like a really good Idea for a Creative FanFic
I wonder how many times I've told him I love him...
Lil_B there is one.
08,01Canadian_Brony: if its not dirty, sure
haha tSparx
Canadian_Brony, you can PM it
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28718/The-Foal-in-The-Basket
AJIsAwesome: I have a general ban on Valentine's day, and I rarely make exceptions. This sounds worth it though :)
kinda
I haven't read it, but it has high ratings
looks short
who's playing again=
not enough
Dark_Horst: Smi
I like thinking Chrysalis is totally incapable of feeling love, but might be attached to a creature that feeds her regurarely out of convienence and companionship
Dark_Horst Sumi
tSparx: It's actually making a reference to a certain PPG episode.
but where is is oc?
AJIsAwesome: Oh?
Dark_Horst: Sumipony isn't put up during ME
oh?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvzDthMqSck
Dark_Horst I dunno. Not up there
Dark_Horst: Messes with the framerate, apparently.
am i the only person who thinks hes hilarious?
tSparx, it's actually not like any other valentines day special
tSparx: Yeah. I did some research, and a scene is a very possible reference to PPG.
It was pretty cool, good song too
AJIsAwesome: I'll watch it, tell you what I think :)
CMC messed up by trying to do a favor for cherilee and now they have to fix it
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9kzx4FUCg1qcxcjfo1_500.jpg
Oh my
tSparx: I'll give you a hint: it's part of Applebloom's daydream.
Cheerilees face in that episode, is amazing, when the CMC first start bugigng her
AJIsAwesome what is PPG?
I don't that Crysalis is incapable of feeling love, She does Care for her Changlings
Powerpuff girls
I know the plot involves some Mac N Cheriliee, that's about it
Powerpuff Girl?
well, motherly love and care, but not romantic love
ok
Tara Strong's other love <3 haha
yeah
XD
Powerpuff Girls
in the song she says "In my heart there is no room" so-- either she loves someone, her hive or otherwise, or she can't feel it
Vivix: My theory is that she can't feel love and that she only uses love and a form of consumption.
*as a form of consumption*
AJIsAwesome, yeah that is what I think too, but that she is very fond of her hive
Vivix: Agreed.
AJIsAwesome: Vivix That's my headcanon
I'd say she really didnt care at all regardless if she could
Well she IS a queen
eloo
It must be pretty nasty in there
I think Crysalis loves herself too much for there to be room in her heart
blue waffles :P
Vivix . . . lemme go off and get philisophical and I'll talk to you again with my thoughts.
I think linking the story from hearts episode with chrysalis would be cool, but in my headcanon she was never a pony to begin with-
hehe
Lore is fun!
Never tell me the odds
In my fic the Changelings came from out of space under the Owlisous meteor shower
I don't really have any headcanon about the changeling's origins, but I'm not as big a fan of them as some of my fellow bronies are :)
Yes
hey everypony
AJIsAwesome: Unless they somehow add to her power
Pearly: Hello!
hey!
I really like them because they are so different to ponies, in behaviour
Hello Pearly
AJIsAwesome: Could want them for selfish reasons, idk
hi Pearly
I'm not much of a headcanon guy, but that's my theory.
Sup Pearly :)
I love changelings for the whole swarm idea which brings many cool stuff
not much here
AJIsAwesome, yeah- I believe she has strong motherly love or something for her hive-
just showered, now she is a clean pny
Transformation, Mind Control, Corrutpion
then you know what you have to do to her....muhahaha
das buffer :/
yeah, she's doing what she has to do, but the swarm is not a--'nice and good' bunch
oh wait a sec I think I'm getting kinda creepy right noe
now**
Tailsopony?
tSparx der*
Lil_B: This buffer
Lil_B: Not the buffer
tSparx or das Buffern
not much tSparx hey there Canadian_Brony how are you MLP_Brovakiin and AJIsAwesome ?
Den bufferen
Oy, Whovians: Which ep is the one where Eccleston shows up on earth (I think) any notices all the text around him says BADWOLF and then something takes over the companion's mind? Or something? I only kinda remember it
Pearly: Pretty good.:)
and he * notices
thats good AJIsAwesome
Lol talking about darkspyro on the phone
Pearly I'm currently in thought of the idea that Chrysalis can feel love.
with who?
Gen
do i know who that is?
tSparx: Episode 12, Season 10
Oops. Paragon points
ait
wait
Unnr|Gardening: Danke schoen!
Season 1
of new who
I knew what you meant :)
I think the song indicates either that she can't feel erotic love (elske) but can feel motherly love/care, or that her heart was already captured (which miight tie in to the heart and hooves legend)
:(
You can't be Renegade against Tali
My only friend in real life
oh
And so the tales of Dickshep end for today
I think I should just wait until the show gives more details about Chrysalis or not.
^
It is very--high and fleety, we might not ever get more info though-
SpadeMagnes[R], except that he got some Paragon Points at the end
but whoever said that abou the hearts and hooves things, now that's stuck in my mind
He's slightly dickshep now
I love how the buffer circle is right in the middle of the menu circle. It fits together amazingly well
doesn't he always do dick shepard
dat SlurryMoon
Vivix hey, that's getting somewhere. She clearly states she doesn't love Shining Armour, but he (technically) loves her. She feeds off the love of others. When you consider the legend, it's possible that she was the queen and after being under the effects of the love potion for years and years, and possibly never becoming cured of it, she needed love to feed off of.
alexxm: Sometimes Smi picks the paragon options (or whatever, the goodguy options)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3HVHNf-oW4 This is the song that I kill people to
GUNDAM STYLE
alexxm: But sledom
seldom*
STOP TORTURING ME WITH MUSIC THAT I CANT LISTEN TO :(
lol Sumi
perfact timing
00,10manly when it makes sence tSparx
Sumica: Yeah, I know :)
NEVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
Vivix therefore, she became Queen Chrysalis and stole away the love of other ponies for her own use.
Canadian_Brony: That's a VERY interesting and plausible theory. Nice.
Oh right, Linux and Netflix don't mix
Yes, it sounds really cool
03 hm?
I think the song and the legend in the valentine sode kinda fits-
AJIsAwesome this is what happens when I get a strange idea and time.
Its almost to 100 billion views i think
hi SlurryMoon
but it might just be coincidence
The dancing GM Head
Canadian_Brony: One question I'm thinking of is what happened to the king in the love story.
Heeeeyyyy sexy layydeee :D
Ohai :)
SlurryMoon: Hello!
Hi SlurryMoon
AJIsAwesome, was the king a pony or an alicorn?
Canadian_Brony bar the spawning of hordes of insectoid offspring
I want to rewatch that part of the episode to check-
DAT ASS
Hello MaxTheBrony
Vivix: I think he was a pony.
AJIsAwesome died. With him gone. Chrysalis needed love.
heya MLP_Brovakiin :)
Then he probably died- and she can't love anyone but him
Canadian_Brony: True.
I haven't been on darspyro in so long
is this like Gundam style?
Oh, so NOW the stream works for me :P
Let it be said that this is -very- interesting to wake up to after a nap
SlurryMoon you missed my theory of how Chrysalis came to be. I made it up in 5 minutes.
But die Sumipony :)
im just a lurker :p
Really cool theory
xD
also, hai everypony
I hope we get more lore and stuff to nerd over in the show in S3
heya Silver_Spoon
Silver_Spoon: Hello!
I would repost, but it's a wall.
hi Silver_Spoon
even inconsistncies or jokes- even mistakes make for great lore
Vivix: like there's any doubt :D
hehehe
how you doing Silver_Spoon
EEEEYYYYYYY Sexay laday!
So excited
brb darlings!
alexxm: pretty good, and yourself?
why is this song so damn catchy?
i'm good Silver_Spoon
00,10my bet is we here somethng next saterday during the weading eps
RRRGGHHH WHY MIPS
This song is actually brilliant social satire as far as korean pop is concerned

The whole spell is broken by X time appart
Dumorimasoddaa, That's true!
Your ideas don't account for that at all
but maybe long time effects of the love poison is pretty severe-
oh it wasn't my idea
Dat moustache
but that might complicate it, I can't ermember the whole text of the legend
No Brony likes me. :(

Canadian_Brony: More like bad writing
08,01who sent me that chrysalis fic?
"I know that sounds incredible" lawl
08,01my god, itis amazing
I'm glad you enjoy it!
Hearts and hooves legend don't seem to refer to any tribe other than Unicorn, and it ends with Chaos reigning, so it sounds more like a "Time for Luna and Cleestia to step in" origin than Chyrsalis-
What was it?
swag
so this guy was the kid from war games
OH MAI
Ofcourse, legends rarely represent reality-

Canadian_Brony: I'd like to think we can work faster than the cold.
So I had to make a new one with a new email that I only made for making the new one
grey man :o
lol
7:O
Canadian_Brony: But even if we can't, maybe someday an AI can.
Shoot it in the eye
The common cold would be curable if we found a cure to all/most virus
this is an interesting show
No selling those bullets like a boss
00,10oh god it just downloaded all of 4chan
haha
WELP
But then curing the cold would be at the bottom of a huge list
It has all the porn!
Sumica: I'm surprised it didn't go insane haha
WE'RE DOOMED
oh god cats
And lolcats!
Sumica: :D then it should die in one second
00,10it's already insaine
I saw all the R34...
that darlek must have seen so much porn
Dumorimasoddaa: maybe for a season. then at least one virus would mutate rendering the serum useless
it contains too much hentai now for anyone to stop it
00,10remember they said it burned for 3 days when it crashed
ZAPP'D
Matrix!
wat
noo!
What the hell does that x ray laser do?
Sumica: Yeah but a normal guy said that, not the Doc.
Alchemist nah I'm assuming we found a universal cure to the viruses work
The bullets evaporate before reaching him!
never really seen this show before
That guy was sooo important to the plot nuu!
Fuck you man
extermite all the things
Oh fluttershy
all ded
So why do we get a xray everytime someone gets zapped?
tSparx I will say it again. The common cold changes its genetic code every year. A vaccine allows your immune system to recognize the genetic code of a virus and destroy it. If it changes constantly, a vaccine is impossible to create.
Howdy Everypony hows it been?
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, but it doesn't change constantly
Malk: Hello!
Canadian_Brony: It changes rapidly.
Canadian_Brony: thank god it's not a powerful virus :D
00,10it can still shoot you
They cant use stairs
Do not put all your faith in stairs.
XD
tSparx you knew what I meant.
elevate
Canadian_Brony: Maybe one day we can build an AI that makes vaccines faster than the cold mutates
inb4 ded
ELEVATE
Oh shit
EXTERMINATE
IT CAN FLOAT
STAIRS DO NOT WORK
oh god ITS LEARNING :O Stairs are no MATCH
Canadian_Brony: I do know what you meant, but that's what I'm getting at: it changes rapidly, maybe we can fight it more rapidly some day
crush. kill. destroy. swag
Hey tSparx is the world ready for our debate?
Though, really, we should just stop fighting the cold :P
7Anyone want to see watermelon art? ._.
uh? sure lol
Malk: Which one?
DAT ELITISM
So robots are racist now?
7http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuiVLP7F0eY&feature=related
7xP
He's the ultimate racist!
dat hubris
it's a mutant
tSparx the one about everything such as the meaning of life and politics
YOU FOOL
DerpyMuffins: it's really a cyborg
/me flips a table
and then humans were stupid
tSparx Philosphy
again
Alister: mutant/cyborg
Don't even tell them that it is right behind?
Mutant/Cyborg/robot
tSparx we'd have to track down the mutated viruses every time. A vaccine would be massively expensive to re-create on an irregular basis. It's cheaper to let people deal with the virus with chicken noodle soup and cold syrup.
Canadian_Brony: I agree, but post-singularity, who knows what's possible?
Canadian_Brony: To quote Momo from Questionable COntent, "The exciting thing about living in a post-singularity world is that we do not know."
its an evil salt shaker
^
dat zap
lol
tSparx true. For all we know, that day may not come in our lifetime.
Rex_Mundi: or a pepper shaker :D
showers for everyone
OH MY GOD
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, I'm not counting on it :P
00,10be effecent
man, those nameks are brutal
my jaw drop
M-m-m-monster kill!
tSparx neuro enhancement will happen in our life time though
Malk: Or not.
When they say EXTERMINATE they mean it
Have a plan to use as many relevant quotes you know.
dat OC pony
Malk: I don't think we know enough about the brain to know how close we are to understanding it, know what I mean? We could figure it out tmorrow, or not in my lifetime.
My unicalade is hungry
Rex_Mundi: it's Sumica's OC :)
MadSurge: I know <3
Rex_Mundi: Sumipony is my favorite :) She makes me SO HAPPY!!!!!! <3
:o thats epic
tSparx its said if our brains where so simple that we could understand we'd be to simple to understand it
zing
burned
Dat twist.
does he have his Sonic Screwdriver or whatever the hay it is? And can it do anything? I know nothing of this show.
tSparx: Sumica makes a pretty pony, eh? <3
Alister: If they could, he would've converted them instead of killing them.

Will this picture ever stop being funny?
tSparx but we have them right now just not availble to the public and not exactly safe
xD
Alister: I don't know about this show, but I think they must feed off of a certain energy, like electricity.
00,10dr rage
AJIsAwesome: They have no means of reporducing or adding to their numbers ?
19 my ass
Alister: Like I said, I have no idea about this show.
tSparx more like 20s
Malk: That actor is at LEAST in her late 20's
tSparx I said more like 20x
20s
bad aiming
He's gained human feelings and emotions?
tSparx: Wreks art is awesome too.

00,10wreks art is why Sumi looks so good
dun dun dun
Sumica: Ikr :3

OohShiny eeyup

Exterminate!

Alister: the whole first season is 9th, and then second season is the 10th
Oh, well then he's only got a half series, or so
Oh hay, Chite Celestia has hit the stores
Daygon Vous n'y avez pas fait avant? /)

*White Celestia
tSparx: Series ? you mean like a story arc ?
on Netflix
Ok Malk i dont know that much
Alister: British for season :P
Daygon I was asking if you really havent done it before?
Twilight would love Dr Who :D
MadSurge: Right?
MadSurge: Imagine Twi watching Star Trek do
OMG
Daygon: You are from Guyane then?
That face that guy had just seemed like he was thinking "I am so high right now."
Alister: So, y'know, when we celebrated the Dr. Who season premiere, they were celebrating the Dr. Who series premiere
tSparx: she would really hate Q :D
6xD
The sound of engines on a space station?
He is still doing it.
OohShiny: No im from Venezuala
OohShiny: No im from Venezuela
MadSurge: I can see her writing Picard fanfic lol
6Gah..I wish I could play the game right now.. x)
00,10not quite tSparx
00,10they call it seasons as well
hey, I got a question. If a Time Lord can regenerate, how did the rest die?
00,10Serise refers to when a new production studio took over the show
Now for the last 4 notes in the song in 3

Sumica: Really? I know that Top Gear is in their 18th series...
and suddenly it's a theme park food court
Or is it 19th?
Time sick?
6Then again,the actual original game would be nice too..I haven't played it in years.. ._.
Oh kay
....so
00,10because they refer to this Dr to searise 3
That happened.
Canadian_Brony You pretty much have to be a to be close to death not dead
Sumica: So for Brits, what's the difference between a season and a series? All my British tv on netflix is organized into series.
00,10they also referr to tennet and smith as serise 3 as well
/me just ran into an apple-selling NPC named "Apple Jack".
STOP NAGGING ME
near death not dead Canadian_Brony
what systems do you have?
Daygon ah. Okay
CK|GW2: :D
Sumica: Well, there's a difference betrween, like, the new Top Gear series (post-Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond) and the new Top Gear series (like series 17 premiere where they had a Jag E-type)

That guy looks familiar, whatells is he in?
yay
THEY WERE FROZEN TODAY
He can taste something wrong
hmm
6Added ^^
Sumica: I get that, but my experience, the Netflix entries for Dr. Who and Top Gear (UK), and Wikipedia all agree on this.
who said wikipedia is wrong?
becuz their dum
Sumica: Well in a way Wikipedia can't be wrong in some cases, on the important articles on it that are locked down from editing
00,10and the anouncer at the end of the show when they were on the BBC called it Searse 3
ill add you later, my bros watching tv :P
6Lol,ok ^^

Wikipedia CAN be wrong because the sources that are cited aren't always as reliable as it's users think.
cya
6I play DCUO,CoD,Infamous 2 and Naruto Shippuden : Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations..Well,I used to anyway..I kinda stopped playing when I started watching Bleach :P
The first thing I saw when came home for the first time in amonth, was a new tv with a built in vcr sitting on the table and I'm like That's mine. You don't need to tell me. And if for some reason you say it's not, you're lying o_o

6Nice :3
which cods do you have?
au revoir Daygon
There were also new couches in the frontroom, but who cares
inb4 he loses the key
6 4 & 6
It seems like he is trying to get that key for some reason.
6I also have WaW but for PS2
which one is 6?
6MW2
ah
this makes me think of that shitty movie
what's it called....
i have waw, mw3 and bo
Shitty movie 3?
mw2 i mean
not me3
mw3
seems legit
6I think it's 6 at least..Didn't WaW come out between 4 and MW2?
6:O
>promises walls of gold
>Canada
i think 4 war modern warfare, so ya waw came out before that
6BO was pretty awesome..
Seriously, not a single Briton here to help us out?
6:O
Canadian_Brony, we definitely have walls of gold in here
dat true man
what, if mw was 4 and mw2 was 6, then whats 5?
/me is very happy
except our gold is more white-ish blue and very cold
when suddenly, corpses
Anyone have pure gold?
tSparx: help ya out with what?
i'm a briton, what y'all need help with?
Movie's on now.
no waw is 5 lol
6Well,I assumed it was WaW..
ya
BronyInstrumental: In TV parlance.
tSparx: a series is just a consecutive collection of shows
6Wasn't some BO2 to come out after MW3?
yup
BronyInstrumental: So what do you call the premiere of Dr. Who recently? The season premiere? The series premiere?
6It's not out yet,is it?
no
tSparx: WE callit the season premiere, cause it's a season of the series. a series is all of it put together, split up into seasons
are you gonna get it?
call it*
Shoot him!
BronyInstrumental: *I* see.
SHOOT HIM!!
GODAMMIT DON'T BE STUPID AND SHOOT HIM!!!
6Nah,doubt it..I'm not into FPS as much anymore so I'm happy with the two I've got :P
6What about you?
same, i dont really like cod to much
The barcode scanner does nothing!!
BronyInstrumental: So then why is my Top Gear split up into 17 series (going up to 2011)?
or simply die
6x)
tSparx: top gear is an exception, seeing as it could have different outcomes each time
The Dr. who DVD's say 'First Series Second series' ect
6I wish I had a few games in mind..
like what?
BronyInstrumental: So we're on Series 18 of Top Gear, but season 7 of Dr. Who?
well, this is just what i've gotten used to in briton dialect
BronyInstrumental and (almost) ends on a bombshell. I've seen it once end in an "inconvenience".
*almsot always
**almost
I can't type
tSparx: precisely
BronyInstrumental: May I just suggest that that is confusing and dumb? jk :P
6Idk..I like action-adventure type of things..I want them to last long and have big levels..free roam ftw!
it is
and I don't think it's correct
it really is
6I guess Skyrim would be good but it's too expensive.. ._.
Canadian_Brony: "And on that bombshell, g'night!" haha, good times :)
well actually theres a zombie game thats being worked on right now called the dead linger
and it kinda fits that description

6Night!
speaking of drawing
My Little Chrono: Triggers Are Magic has updated *squee*
what happened to that art contest you people were holding
:o
I wonder what Mike is doing...
It would be fun to host a show once a month about art in the bronysate community , with maybe a contest .
Buytoast: aren't you included in that generalized term "you people"
:p
i ain't a mod
ah, ok then
he maybe wasnt part of holding the contest :)
twasn't sure who ye were speaking of
well, Wrek draws often, kirz did some drawing the last time he streamed, and VioletVanilla streams music she creates which is technically an art.
Wrek keeps getting on frawfriend, his most recent drawing was the headliner for the latest drawfriend
Who's ready to be jelly?

So no stream right now. Mods are lazy too. :P I kid, they're probably busy.

Rex_Mundi I need a girl first
Oops
wrong
:P
Weddings are nice
but- most I've been to have been way too long
Vivix: How long?
4-5 hours, plus you know the party at the end, which I never attend
Weddings are overrated :S
Vivix: Wow...........
I'm going to a secret wedding soon, wich will last about 40 minutes
:p
Getting Married sound like a horrible idea
Secret?
I don't get the romance between LONG wedding ceremonys
Well hopefully I get a brony girlfriend that would approve. :P
we're gonna be like 4-5 people
so yeah noone should know
I would like a simple cerimony If i get married
:O
Yeah all that around is just too much
Vivix: Ah. A shotgun wedding. :D
Getting Married sounds like constraining yourself for no reason
It's supposed to be about the love, not the money- but you know
people are different
a simple speech and the closest friends.
Man, having a brony girlfriend would be the best
hehe, well they've been together for 20 years
I just found out Wrek is an amazing artist
xD
No waaaay
man
If I were to get married, I'd love to get one that trolls all the guests, or is otherwise memorable.
CCCP: It's just putting a title on something.
DerpyMuffins he is amazing isnt he :)
you also get a lot of legal rights
like if your husband or wife dies, you have much less trouble surviving on your own
thats just evil :s
Klumzeedragon its more than that :(
Do I annoy you with my constant talk of Mike? XD
that's why they want equal rights between partnership and marriage in this country
thats why its bad
I mean Wrek does both cool art and adult art....
nah its just ponies with clothes xD
Kandarihu: Like a Celestia-esque girlfriend?
he does adult art though
with vajajays and stuff
no haha its all good
deffine adult :P
ah
erotic
wait whut.
Its seems ponies with clothes seem more erotic
he has only done one 18+ pic though
Irony
I meant the wedding.
well, as far as we know
IKR DerpyMuffins
Vivix i think he has done 2
CCCP: Itgoes both ways with marriage I suppose.
DerpyMuffins: A few of us were talking about this the other day :)
really? neat
The cherlee and Aj i think
:P
I think like 4 or 5 of them
Oh, Haven't seen the AJ one
Never get married, Never get a job, Never drive a car, neverf eat, never talk, never go online, never leave your house, Jsut watch ponies
There is Twi, AJ, Cheerilie
I cant see it cause im a stupid mf who said my real age on dA ...
hehe
t
I leave for a bit after listening to Franzl Lang ( a Yodeler) and return....to talk of Erotic Art!?!? Dafuq Chat! :D
I dont exactly know if its AJ
Maybe fluttershy
Klumzeedragon it just seems like marriage is taken to seriously just like life
I think the Cheerilee one is the only explicit one I've seen
Havent seenthat AJ and Cheerilee
Maximore saucy ponies for us then...
xD
CCCP: But you're online know........
*now*
heh :P
AJIsAwesome darn it
MaxTheBrony: He did an AJ one? .-. It's not on DA.
Ravebrony, Wrek's erotic art
It is
the Badapples?
wasnt that AJ
Vivix: Still! :D
Yea
im just guessing
Klumzeedragon: yes it is
hehehe
Klumzeedragon, he's not done with it
I'd post link, but you know....
*cough*ThisIsntPG13Convo*cough*
yyeah-
:D
The Mods are asleep post wrek art :3
most of his 18 stuff were rapidly posted on other sites by other people
Hmm!
=_(\
xD
Rex_Mundi: I meant a naughty AJ. The Admarial AJ is up.
Can you post erotic ponies?
You can but its not allowed
No, sorry
:P
Is it even in the rules
Derpy_Hooves: I wouldn't
Klumzeedragon: There is another AJ one...
Probably Twi or Rarity, or Fluttershy
they look weird standing up though
yeah
Its Muffins, not Hooves
DerpyMuffins, yeah it's in the rules
rainbow dash for the win
I could never marry RD, or be with her- that personality type would just spark the oddest arguments
DerpyMuffins: Yeah, it's actually PonyChat general rules too: all channels are SFW unless marked otherwise.
hello every one
heya cow334

Franek12354: eyup

MaxTheBrony: and they tend to blog sometimes too
ah, the artist traning grounds for EQD
Vivix, do they frequent /d/?
Alchemist yeeeh
a way for Lord Dragon Fucker to garner more money
MaxTheBrony: but bronystate is super bettereh
if it's successful
CrimsonPhoenix, at least two of them were /b/
urgh /b/
Y no Girls on BS :(?
I stopped going to 4chan after /y/ got boring
I bet you can tell I never went to b
CrimsonPhoenix: /d/ is even worse than /b/. Do not go there, Crimson
i wsh bronystate can go on my mc sever
tSparx, I go to /d/ regurly
what is /d/?
a thread?
well all be in equestria
I pleasure myself to that
CrimsonPhoenix: Well, er, more power to you.
Alchemist, you don't want to know
I know about /b/, but dunno about /d/
Alchemist: It's where the *dark* porn goes
buffer means/b/ i guess?
Which, I mean, really, more power to you if you like that, but MAN do I not haha
lol
for /b starting with "random anything" it sure has spawned alot of repetive stupid jokes
tSparx: oh, well, Im not gonna go there :D
Pikachu: /b/ is a board on 4chan dot org
it is occationally spammed with childporn
tSparx: ohs
Pikachu: It's famous for not having any rules (other than nothing illegal)
Aw no way! D:
Woooah
Vivix: I know right? Pretty said.
no stream right now
Pikachu: And it is a cesspool, whence the best and worst of a lot of internet culture has come.
Cancelled?
.... Childporn ... really?
Dem basterds...
It has happened a few times, they hate it
MaxTheBrony: ...
tSparx, what kind of rules are you talking about?
...
tSprax: i better write this down
but some people hang there to snap it up before it gets deleted
Dafuq you talking about
CrimsonPhoenix: On /b/, the lack thereof
Wow I come back to read something about childporn?
I was going to something for that... but when i started College i poured my time into that D: Guess it was a good thing to do, lol
I walk out for 1 minute, come back and the first thing I read is "childporn"
I think something random will pop up on stream
xD
please
DerpyMuffins: /b/ is a weird place, man
no more
;__;
oh /b/ is really anything
DerpyMuffins: *jazz hands* :O
people said that /b/ is hilarious and memes are born there. what I saw is 90% porn, 10% trolling
Ok lets end conversation here..________
but 4chan in general has quite a few rules
Oh yes.
I see ponies everywhere. http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/53301000/jpg/_53301855_976_shuttle_nasa.jpg

...
/me is glad he stays away from 4chan
I'm not a channer, I just never got into it
what are you talking about
Alchemist, back then /b/ did make a LOT of memes
NOTHIGN
cow334: /b/
WE ARE TALKIGN ABOUT NOTHING
MLP_Brovakiin, me too.
tSparx: OH GOD NO
memes aren't really good though
now it's nothing worth talking about
Canadian_Brony, don't worry, THAT wasn't part of the topic
/me went to 4chan once. The horror.
Vivix thank Celestia

http://www.redbubble.com/people/ak71/works/8568074-loyalty?body_color=black&p=t-shirt&print_location=front&size=medium&style=mens
Rainbow
Dash
It has evolved to bronynation.
AJ is my favorite but I beleve that it is down to personal prefrence
CrimsonPhoenix: hhhhhmmmmmm....nnnaaaa
;D
Rarity, PinkiePie and Fluttershyy!! Yaaay
tSparx: When you're a pony, gender s irrelevant?
OvergrownPegasus411: Well, for one thing, *I* joined, and that's important :$
Wait what?
Hehehe
http://derpy.me/7Ijqh see this outside your house wat do?
derp
Everypony is best pony. TOPIC CHANGE: What's your favorite 4chan board. I'll bet nopony here would say /b/
crakle is best
Love AJ too
CCCP: Burn it
Klumzeedragon: Nah, but when it's me on the Internet my gender's unimportant. I often go as female, just to see how people react.
xD
Kandarihu mine is /b/b
Applejack2012: I gathered :D
Klumzeedragon: Usually pretty well, but only in recent years. /eyeroll
I don't really browsee 4chan. More of a redditor
tSparx your a virtel transvesite?
I don't browse reddit or 4chan
i wish i can sing on bronysate :l i may be very shy like flutter shy
MaxTheBrony: I guess :P
xD
My favorite is /g/, myself.
CCCP ignore it like I do 4chan. Iff it becomes a problem, phone the police.
/me has never been on 4chan
MaxTheBrony: But I am very much, actually male. If you'll recall, I'm a Maxwell :)
i dont go to four chan
Can't wait for season 3
:D
;___; I always cry during movies...
tSparx: Funny how are people have declined huh?
/me is bored http://derpy.me/NXtkU
Canadian_Brony IT IS THE POLICE
/me pats AJIsAwesome
AJIsAwesome: Niether have I, lets keep it that way
my only questoin is who is the owner of bronystate
Klumzeedragon: Hmm?
Alchemist i know that feeling bro :p
OvergrownPegasus411, I agree. Bronystate has gone WAY downhill in the season gap
new topic....
weather.
I think it's stayed the same
as i said.
CCCP where am I?
Canada
from as far as I remember
How many licks dose it take to get to a center roll of a tootsie pop
Canadian_Brony lol
2
buck 4chan
>_>
I only visit bronystate for watching new seasons and aquabats
44
tSparx: I don't know. :D
/me is very VERY bored http://derpy.me/b0IVg
100,124,103
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA&feature=my_watch_later_videos&list=WL914EFE097ED6B966 go watch this.
From my perspective, very little has changed xD
Incounting
4chan = where bronies were born
Alchemist that actually looks like its fun.
OvergrownPegasus411, okay. That's a bad way to put it. It hasn't gone WAY downhill. Sorry
It's just calmer, due to offseason
CCCP: And for that, I will always be grateful. But...
Whats the name of the background pony that is dressed up as a viking in the Luna Eclipse episode? I've always wanted to know that. Shes my favorite background pony
bronies might have been born on 4chan, but that is not all of our origin
I only discovered bronystate 5 weeks ago, but I love it. It is mainly the people, everyone here is so cool and nice <3
I like Lyra and COlgate
MaxTheBrony: If I imagine myself do it irl it becomes a bit creepy
I visit Bronystate for Equestria Daily sneaks, and new seasons of course
*hugs MLP_Brovakiin*
Alchemist heh xD
MLP_Brovakiin: aww :)
i like rose luck she is so awesome
I have a playlist of music, but you probably won't like it. Most of it is rock alternative by Simple Plan and Finger Eleven. 1/3 of it is pony music, tho
atleast
/me hugs everyone :3
MLP_Brovakiin: Awesome man
MLP_Brovakiin: <3 :)
@MLP_Brovakiin All of the fandom is so nice.
MaxTheBrony: and that sentence sounds very wrong out of context
I think tomorrow will be a shopping day for when I leave for BFF friday...and need to settle on a schedule
i vist Bronystate because Im banned from everyother site on the web
I discovered this place in winter
Alchemist: haha yeah it does !
Vivix: Very true, I left 4chan YEARS before the birth of bronies.
So does anyone know her name?
Im not sure ive seen her before
:o
im going to draw all of bronysate (well sort of ) what will be Canadian_brony , tSprax , And CCCP cuties marks be? (your choice)
oni_link: I don't. :/
yeah- and I found ponies via yt and images, general aniamtion interest and fan of such shows. Brony just happened to come along
aw :\
I found Bronystate after watching "Ballad of the Brony" a couple months ago. About one month before whenever the Tom awards started
Pikachu: I was talking with my BFF Victoria today about cutie marks, I don't think I could pick my own.
Bff is only 2 hours away from me but I cant go to cause I have school
._. danm
My cutie mark shall be an nes controller. You can make any design you want except it has to have glassess.
tSprax: lol
Pikachu http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg/200px-Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg.png
i must admit though bronystate is the reason that I have been staying up untill 5 am some mornings whatching films and chatting. it has completly ballsed up my sleeping pattern :P
haha
:P
dat Commie
And I am a female pony. Not a colt
CCCP: kk
My initial views to MLP: FIM was switching from negative to neutral, until I decided to watch the show.
MLP_Brovakiin, me too ;__;
watching
NO. KITCHEN. JOKES.
:3
I was more or less instantly interested AJIsAwesome, I just-thought it looked so cute
everyone will be done one by one :)
all my wants: http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-Rainbow-Dash-brony-glass-/130747344860?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e712627dc
Pikachu: A helpful tip: if you start typing someone's name, and then press tab, it'll fill out the name for you -- and make sure you don't misspell it :D
Unless there's any canon evidence of cutie marks changing, an SNES controller for my ponification.
OvergrownPegasus411: Not everyone is like that
haha me too MLP_Brovakiin
yeah! what did kitchens ever do to you? :[
haha
:P
hehehe
man i bad at spelling
So like pika [tab] becomes Pikachu :)
yeah
They made me.. make sandwhiches :'(
MLP_Brovakiin: Yeah, I don't think I've had a normal sleep since I've found this place... Been watching the sun come up every day.
OvergrownPegasus411 colts and fillies are young ponies. Mares and stallions are when they've grown up.
*hugs OvergrownPegasus411* awww
Pikachu: oh my XD
Klumzeedragon ikr
OvergrownPegasus411: My god thats dreaddfull
Yeah I am a fillie
00,03Hmmm...
Unless this place has a age restriction
Heya Scoot-Scootaloo
I heard of Bronystate through Ballad of The Brony. At first I only went here for the movies and pony episodes, but lately these past few weeks I been here a lot more often.
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
no age restriction
AJIsAwesome same :)
OvergrownPegasus411: it does, its 14 I think
I am a stallion? AW YEAH, I'M A STALLION /)
OvergrownPegasus411: i will do ur cutie mark affter CCCP
*I've*
Fffffffffffffuuuuuu

00,03I once met a 6 yr old in the chat...
AJIsAwesome, I found it via EQD, but I was also only really here for episodes, but during summer so many fun people to talk to
Pikachu do me :3
00,03Twas a very sd day :(
0,5six?
O.o
0,5BHAHAHAHA
Klumzeedragon: not gonna lie, I have visited bronystate everyday scince I discovered it, and I intend to stay like that damnit :D
00,03sad*
Scoot-Scootaloo it was an FBI agent
Oh good cause I am way older then six
I dont think liqour stores are open labor day :\
i hate children
MaxTheBrony: ok
0,5is so sd
Scoot-Scootaloo: I can't decide if that's awesome or horrifying, or both. Both.
too loud
and annoying
0,5i cry evrtiem
Scoot-Scootaloo: can you be 100% sure he was really a 6yr old?
Scoot-Scootaloo whats the story behind that
MLP_Brovakiin: Same here.
00,03lik dis if u cy evertim
must aquire $90: http://www.ebay.com/itm/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-Set-of-6-pint-glasses-/130747344924?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item1e7126281c
If I could get someone that is skilled at pixel art, I would have them make an 8bit Link but have him pallette swapped to look like Fierce Deity and that would be my cutie mark :3
AJIsAwesome: I found it through Ballad of a Brony too. :P
... well how young do you think young is?... or where goes the limit.. i quite young.
Anyone ever heard the song "Long way from equestria"? The lyrics are so sad
xD
00,03>_>
Dohohoho oh Scoot-Scootaloo
Scoot-Scootaloo: :D
Young is like 1-12
troll
Scoot-Scootaloo: ok :( im sad
ah phew
Klumzeedragon: Same High five!
My friend Grace H. showed me MLP, but it took me a year after that to decide, "oh, I should give it a watch"
:)
AJIsAwesome I found this through Ballad of the Brony too. I came late one night and they were streaming a comedian. I came back for movie night and "A Canterlot Wedding" premiere. Been coming back irregularilly ever since.
I am almost "old"
I think young is 1-16 and so forth
Scoot-Scootaloo hmmph.
D: aw Vivix
Scoot-Scootaloo: Stream something Mr. MLG please?
/me pats MaxTheBrony
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo
Define "old" :P
00,03Fiineee~
I found this site through Ballad though :)
MaxTheBrony: depends on what context. In some aspects a 25 year old is still young
:D
old is when you start screaming at kids on the lawn Cypresswolf
How about you stream.... so many ways to play? :D
Scoot-Scootaloo: <3 Thanks~
00,03It will be my lsast stream for a looong time, since University will eat up my day...
guys guess what?
Trolololololol
:D is that all it takes, Im there already
I found this place by finding episode chats
Scoot-Scootaloo: :(
8+ is too damn old
Im 16 ... but yeah i can act older , or younger deppending on the situation :)
Too old... *pedo face*
Scoot-Scootaloo, YOU KNOW WHAT TO STREAM
Scoot-Scootaloo: a story, perhaps?
Scoot-Scootaloo let's make the most of it. Good luck in university.
lolcaps
nooo Scoot
but yeah you know what to stream
Scoot-Scootaloo: We still love you <3 :D
Old to me is when you start spotting grey hairs in your beard
/me can barely even remember 16, even though it wasn't *too* long ago...
Scoot-Scootaloo i hope you will show lots of ponies in it :3
CrimsonPhoenix he does?
I want to go to uni~~ *whine jelly
/me has a kitteh
woot woot go scooters
Believe it or not, I found this site through Google :D also I was glad that I was able to catch the ending of the wedding here. (At the time I couldn't keep up with the chat though)
Scoot-Scootaloo: Then lets go out with a bang for you~ :)
Yeah the chat goes so fast.
All I remember from being 16 is a mix of grunge and emo
xD
Im not emo man
hehe
I need to finish High School before I go to university
tSparx: I know that feel. I'm only 22 too.
I love how everypony tries to make funny remarks releated to the episode XD
im not emo >_>
Not even 30 yet and Im already starting to grey
yeah, tomottow is registration week for me too at uni. But at least I will start my research already. Sounds more fun than sitting at class al day. :)
17-20 is a perfect age :)
im three years old
I'm 23, but a lot of those teen years are forgotten ish
... ._.
And no one really listens to eachother
/me is 22
Klumzeedragon: I have been purosefully unwilling to define how old I am, but I'm about that old
OvergrownPegasus411: haha yeah :P
/me is 20
Cypresswolf, ooh! But gray can be very handsome
18

Kandarihu|1978: oh man :D
00,10uhhhhh
00,03It

A fair warning, for some people, that is what a bad trip's like. This is why your first few trips should never be done alone.
00,03um...
Not that bad.
und then Scoot-Scootaloo got creative with chat
only one thing to say: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8wnfppqAJ1rsf6bb.gif
11,02I think it's time for a PARTY...
00,10that was the edited version
Scoot-Scootaloo: Was awesome, right?
Always have someone experienced in the room when you're tripping!
edited version?
That's my lesson for the day.
twilight_sprinkle: yeah, but it caught you by surprise huh? :D
Who's talking?
tSparx: or not do trips at all
MadSurge: eh nah, like i said, ive seen worse
wait is this Scoot-Scootaloo talking...
is this the streamer?
whats going on
twilight_sprinkle: Well, yeah. I wasn't giving that advice to people who never wanna trip :/
Sumica the unedited version has hell involved or something? :D
no this is Jesus
I didn't get that video...
No, It's the video.
twilight_sprinkle: Why would they wanna know? xD
hi

Heh, the materialist view is a nihilist viewpoint, voiding all meaning and morality.

Hey! :)
OK, this is disturbing.......i'd like to find out about death MY WAY
Hello Ponyloverforever

NOT BY KILLING MYSELF, oh no
I don't fear death, it'l happen it its own time
can we please move on
I think I came up with all this at the age of 10 or something... I was scared as hell of dying in that age
I'm eleven. I will still be alive when you are all dead. UMAD?
Yep. That is life guys.
It sucks
Blahblahblahblah death blahblahblahblah porn blahblahblah
Ahem, y'all can press the *mute* button
GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!
Or you know
CUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
tSparx, I already did
OvergrownPegasus411: unless you get hit by a care.
I'm thinking about how many people I affected during life - isnt that all that matters?
OvergrownPegasus411: NOT IF I KILL YOU FIRST :P
CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!
OvergrownPegasus411: We only have like a 10 year gap
car*
OvergrownPegasus411: There's a great chance I'll outlive you
This is making me sleepy
twilight_sprinkle: the atheist view is nihilist, trying to argue otherwise is to suggest something has abject meaning, and materialism rejects that. Thus nothing has meaning and thus nobody, not even yourself has meaning, that makes humanism pointless as humans are just an arrangment of molecules. Any meaning in an atheist viewpoint is a delusion.
Get it? I said CUUUUUT instead of KHAAAN
OvergrownPegasus411: nah I would have lived my life while youre still struggling through yours. Problem? *trollface*
OvergrownPegasus411 im 14.....
such a dim outlook on life :
The bad guy in his story, Remnants 8)
@oni_link FFFFUUUUUUU
:|
Rex_Mundi: I know several atheists who aren't materialists, first off.
CAN WE WATCH SOMETHING ELSE?!
oh
this experiment is making me older, but none the wiser
oh boy, do i see someone saying athiests are deluded?
here we go
Rex_Mundi: but its true, humans are just a pile of molecules.
hi Dark92Enigma
Oh god
How can an atheist not be a materialist?
Pegasister6414: NO, dont complain about the stream, the streamer doesnt care
tSparx: do they belive aliens give their lives meaning?
Maybe we shouldn't have streamed this video...........:S
sup DoctoDoctorWho
anything on?...
Atheism = the belief that there are no deities
IGNORE THIS GUY, TOY FREAKIN STORY IS ON ABC FAMILY RIGHT NOW!
atheism does not make one inherently better or worse than a theist
Hey, I love stuff and I found this offensive :D
Tell me Khan, does it cut to something else, tell me something!
the only god i believe in is ROOOOOGER FEDERERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
according to Rex_Mundi it does
Atheism =/= the belief that the only things that are real are those which can be empirically measured
Inb4 there's a screamer at the end :D
^
That = Materialism
Science proved that god exists
Mute
MUTE!
Dovah: I'm a Catholic, no it didn't
There we go
Dovah: err no it didnt
Off to toy story
I get so excited when I hear him reply xD
Dovah: Im fixing my house, a panzer battalion just blasted through
ingwaz: In an atheist, thus nihilistic view, it means that Atheists are exactly the same thing as theists, and also equally nothing
I'll be back once it's over
Dovah: Science will never prove that
inb4 intense debates......
lol
And then the lord said, Let me resurrect these fresh beats!
/me KHAN: i've done worse than leaving you alone.....i shall leave you like this video left everyone else......Buried Alive.....Buried Alive.....
somewhere in this ramble, I forgot what he was talking about
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
!NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHK
inb4 religion war :P
tSparx: science more or less explained the existance of god, trust me.
Aw man that's not cool scoots!
Dovah: They called it a god particle out of irony :S
pew pew
You troll!
my religion is better than yours!
I'm getting freaked out...
00,10this guy re itterates alot
Dovah: "Trust me"
Dovah: HAHAHA
and DoctoDoctorWho ....
Dovah: No.
Rex_Mundi, you're talking a load of bollocks to be honest
anyway le food time, brb
this guy is more boring that my ass on soft earth
You don't get to be a liberal Catholic by taking other people's views blindly.
And why are we watc hing this?
Oh hi DoctoDoctorWho Sorry i was busy bashing this video
Rex_Mundi: i disagree with the nihilistic view completely
thats it
tSparx: *sigh* dammit.... I cant post vidio links during stream otherwise i would.
I'm back. How much of what did I miss?
Ima get some lemonade. brb everypony. :)
/me shapes hand to a gun
I think phase linked this earlier http://theoatmeal.com/comics/religion

and i never want ponies
Death=waiting for HL3
^
Nightmare Fuel > This Shit
so . . . what am I looking at?
So whats on stream?
I just got back
Dovah: I am a religious man. I am a scientific man. The two go together like PB&J, but you cannot prove or disprove the existence of an omnipotent deity, it contradicts the meanings of both science and the term omnipotent deity
MLP_Brovakiin: that comic is just stupid because all it basically is saying is that the only good believer of any religion is one that does not even truly believe in their religion. that comic just wants people to shut up and not have any real belief
Been afk
WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE
^
DerpyMuffins: Audio Log.
WE ARE GOING TO THAI :(
Some people just cant handle change
Whose audio log?
Theists think god gives meaning to this world, atheists just arbitrarilu decided life has meaning for no reason other than it gives them happy thoughts. But in the atheist view, both those viewpoints are wrong. thus atheists are exactly the same as theists in everyway. both delusional pointless sacks of meat.
tSparx: ahhh, i do so love when i meet someone who shares my view that religion and science are great together
tSparx: I never said he was omnipotent as a matter of fact i thing that is a bunch of BS
CHAAAAAAANGE! Ya got change!
Well I'm gonna watch get creative again
cachi01|phone: http://blackmesasource.com/ does this doo :)
Dovah: Well, as I respectfully disagree...
Is this over yet?
Holy... SHIIIIIIIIT OMG MLP_Brovakiin
cachi01|phone: ;)
my take on this, stuff happens. You'll die eventually. Just enjoy life
heh, love and tolerate... as long as we're not talking about those who believe in deities, or those who don't, or those who don't but still believe life has some meaning...
"decided life has meaning for no reason other than it gives them happy thoughts. But in the atheist view, both those viewpoints are wrong" Who says they're wrong? You?
tSparx: Blraglflargplarplglzurger! I am trying to find the vidio so i can link it when there isnt a stream.
00,10so is he saying he looks forward to death ?
Nostalgia Critic's Let's Play of ''Bart's Nightmare'' >>>>>> This video
Sumica: :D
@Sumica: I think so...
Dovah: Man, if the faith I've spent years building up can be debunked by one youtube video, I must be the dumbest person you've ever met >_>
Dark92Something, is that a bad video?
Dark92Enigma agreed
Sumica i dunno he repeats itslef a lot and it's confusing me so i stoped listening
lol
this is like watching a nostalgia critic video
wait so what was his point?
tSparx: never meet you so....
I don't get it...
00,10that video much like his life is compresed and wasted
Mah popcorn burn and taste like shit if i let them 6:66 in the microwave so CHECKMATE ATHEISTS
Well, that was deep
Kandarihu|1978: one of the worst Doug Walker ever did
Buytoast, well, NC talks about fun stuff.
Oh this!
OH THANK GOD
SATAN
Scoot-Scootaloo you really like creepy videos right ? :p
i've never seen him talk about anything fun or be funny himself
Kandarihu|1978 it was created with the sole purposes of A) give NC a small break B) make a running gag in the next vdeo funny
also oh boy
Life has meaning to an individual, it's not an inherent thing.
Hai satan! Nice to meet you!
Rex_Mundi: Sure, yeah, it's postulated. And? You either have to assume a deity (or deities) exist, or that it doesn't.
What is this? o_o
Kandarihu|1978: let's say he tired to do something different: PLAY videogames instead of reviewing them......sadly, he doesn't have the patience of a regular gamer, so he ragequitted, and went back to movies
Rex_Mundi: If that's all you're trying to say, I totally agree.
tSparx: also its not a youtube video its a full episode.
lets get creative!
Dark92Something, I see.
pineapples please
I heard "purist"
What is this...?
Kandarihu|1978: he reviewed only 2 games: Bebe's Kids and Blue's Brothers
FRUIT
Oranges! With smiley faces!
Both of them based on movies
Walking along a street
Rex_Mundi: I assume it does, or, rather, I make a set of assumption that implies that life has meaning.
Pegasister6414: part of a special on Mark Twain
The meaning of life, the universe and everything is 42
^
Oh, it's a thing based on that Mark Twain Book, I see
The meaning of life is Twilights plot
MLP_Brovakiin: NO~! That's the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything.
Silver_Spoon: yes
Kandarihu|1978: EXACTLY......And he reviewed the Bebe's Kids movie, remember?
This is creepy
Like really creepy
O___________O
How about we all stop arguing about who is right? We can never know which side of the argument is correct, and should just enjoy life as it happens!!!
DEATH
Blues Brothers is this next weekend's B Movie, right?
yes
DerpyMuffins: the creepy part is yet to come
NOOOO
Hi im back
Scoot-scootaloo can we watch some marble hornets? :)

and what is this!? O_O
:(
O_o
Kandarihu|1978: EEEEEEEYUP
Is Scoot-Scootaloo streaming?
Rex_Mundi: The meaning for me would just be to enjoy life.
Too many people, most atheists and theists alike are exactly the same. Nobody challenges their own philosophical belifes. I believe in God because i decided that was logical.
DED
:'(
For other people it might be to make a difference to the world
In that case, it would be great if someone were to do a playthrough of the Blues Brothers game after BMN
I don't see what point you're trying to make
and then...... Murder
........
EARTHQUAKE
poor clay ppl :(
Well, I'm not going to bed.
Kandarihu|1978: Good luck with that somepony.....
Yup creepy
Lets just drop religion entirely please, Soo who likes muffins?

Awww, he's thinkin of going back to sleep :c
NOM
This and get creative are WTF
11,02i liek muffins :D
not the cow :'(
I don't know, that's not what I want, ask someone who does, I suppose because they want to feel they've used their life to do some good, and to leave a mark on the world.
Hi SuperBrony64
Tha poor cow
MOOOM..... WHATS HAPPPENNNIIIING
Maybe they want to be remembered, they're scared of being forgotten when they die
SuperBrony64, can you make it happen?
/me gives SuperBrony64 a muffin :3
I'm scared now...
what is this called?
Yeah?
This is really creepy now
Did someone mention muffins?
Usually helping people in 3rd world countries
everytime i see this http://three-sigma.blogspot.com/2011/07/lets-see-what-weve-got.html
well yes, for me life isnt about enkoying it because that can be egoistic. for me its more about makingthe world better
Dat love
/me noms on the muffin
This was Mark Twain's depressing period, people
Because that's how society views it
Uh...
:O MR ROGERS
Lolwut

WTF we watching?
Its just so random
00,03We ain't watching ponies~
Mr rogers in a bloodstein sweater
Well this is Mr. Rogers winning something

LETS WATCH MOAR PONIES!
00,03No.
DerpyMuffins whatever the buck Scoots wants to stream
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SHOOOWDOWN
And again
Woot woot ^^
You said that, not me.
That you steaming Scoot-Scootaloo?
Pegasister6414: never ask for ponies, you'll get anything but G4
Hey everypony! :) Whos streaming and whatre we watching?
But what's socially acceptable, what's good, what's bad, that does come from society
aw I remember this man :(
Hello DerpDash :)
Creepy stuff! Creepy stuff!
MadSurge G3 :/
hi DerpDash Scoots is streaming . . . stuff
SuperBrony64: We have a request for you.......it so happens that next week the Blue's Brothers movie will be up for this movie weekend, so if that's OK with you.....can you do the playthrough for the Blue Brother's videogame? WE won't blame you for ragequitting when it happens......
cachi01|phone: or G2
I thought mr rogers was dead, go figure
Fred Rogers pretty much started the self esteem movement. I guess he meant well with it, but it's been corrupted, like so many thing
he is dead
Canadian_Brony: ahh :P
I really want to see more creepy stuff
That's how it is
Nothing is inherently 'good' or 'bad'
no one type
SADFACE
We had slaves in this country at one point, and everyone was fine with it, it wasn't bad.
shit
OvergrownPegasus411: Why?
11,02Dark92Enigma: Okie, but we're not watching Blues Brothers next weekend.
Society's view on it changed
i was thinking about a cookie..
And it became 'bad'
right in my feels :(
00,03wow... that WAS ten seconds..
Scoot-Scootaloo: woot woot
Scoot-Scootaloo IKR?
I counted :3
That's just how things work.
I counted too
I really want scary tuff :)
What God, in all of his love, deems to be good is good. What he deems to be evil is evil. It doesn't matter whether society agrees or disagrees.
Awww <3
It isn't some view that I hold
How am I saying that?
boy you jsut keep asserting yiou're right don;t you
Wut
WHY U DO THIS Scoot-Scootaloo
What's this?
Le.wild.music vid
HURT
10 seconds isn't long enough for me to think about all the people who influenced my life. Too many people.
JOHNNY CASH
by Nine Inch Nails
as performed by Johny Cash
I was saying the atheist view is inherrintly nihilistic. And you just said just that.
he just sounds like a nice guy, not like a child rapist nice, just legitly nice. we need more people like him.
GET THIS MAN A PLASTER
DoctoDoctorWho: no we need a panzer battalion.
DoctoDoctorWho: you mean Mr Rogers?
MLP_Brovakiin, he's dead now.
song name?
plz?
mr rogers was a good guy
Rex_Mundi: Do you know what nihilistic means? Moral relativism =/= nihilism.
Actually, what I called you out on was this
[00:23] <Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: the atheist view is nihilist, trying to argue otherwise is to suggest something has abject meaning, and materialism rejects that. Thus nothing has meaning and thus nobody, not even yourself has meaning, that makes humanism pointless as humans are just an arrangment of molecules. Any meaning in an atheist viewpoint is a delusion.
he doesn't know what it means
DANM
Because it's clearly bullshit
but it sounds like a fancy word
Scary stuff plz?
Cool song is cool
Kandarihu|1978: Did no one hear when he hurt himself :(
so he'll just use it
yeah, rogers 4ever
to sound important
Empire of dirt?
Mr Rogers would have liked ponies :)
Dovah: always will
^^
MLP_Brovakiin: This is just a cover of a NIN song
You can't 'reason' that "nothing has meaning"
What is the name of this song?
That doesn't make any sense
tSparx a pretty nice cover
/me is awefully confused again :/
00,03Johnny Cash's version of Hurt
cachi01|phone: I consider it equal to the original.
k
/me is confused
Yes, that's what you said at the start, and it's rubbish
The meaning of life is to make mistakes...and then surpass them
^ yo dawg
/me is a theology major... and is still very confused...
I can respect Mr Cash becase he wrote music, Elvis on the other hand...
If the atheist point is the truth than there is no meaning and thus all morality and virtue are dilusions
11,02Atheism is just the abscence in belief of an all-mighty being, not the absence of belief.
this song
WHY DOES HE WANT AN EMPIRE OF DIRT?!
What is your definition of dilusion?
Rex_Mundi: And it's frustrating that you keep saying that.
Not truth?
/me gets creative
delusion*
Pegasister6414: People like what they like
Rex_Mundi: Atheism is a big tent.
chills
this whole conversation ain't going to end. the guy's name means "King of the World", he has a bigger ego than duke nukem
Rex_Mundi: Lots of different people believe lots of different things.
Humanity needs purpose, without it, we are useless
Sir Cash :(
I would want an empire of water that would be pretty cool
Rex_Mundi: Lots of different atheists believe lots of different thigns.
"Through the Wormhole Season 3 Episode 10: Did We Invent God?"

I go off, shower and eat some after-workout ice cream and you guys are still talking religion
BRUSHIE BRUHIE
Silver_Spoon, that's an important part of life. Can't call it the meaning of life. However, we must be careful not to make mistakes we can never come from.

So you say that morality and virtue are delusions because they aren't inherently there?
NullRadix: Yep, 'cause as it turns out we can talk about what we want as long as mods don't start waving the banhammer :)
What is this?
I thought that kid was peeing at first
Eeeehhh, I gotta go to bed guys. Nighty <3
Because I say that's a stupid argument
^^^
nigght MadSurge
night MadSurge
Night MadSurge
Kandarihu|1978: maybe surpass the deadly ones before they kill you :)
seeya MadSurge
is this a Coldplay song?
More scary stuff please? :(
/me stays out of this religon talk
BRB gonna make a sandwich
I just dont think you give a good argument for "Why" to these things and just run on assumptions.
Opinions are over rated.
*: so
there can be meaning in life even if the atheist's view point was true
Rex_Mundi: All we can do is run on assumption.
*slowly backs aqay from the argument*
OvergrownPegasus411 just go and google MLP G3 but beware. Its fucking scary
me/ m
That's what *faith* is all about, after all xD
I just like to have a good idea of how things factually work.
Teddy?
You're basically saying that anything we've 'made up' is a delusion
"they're tearing my argument apart! I know, I'll attack their arguments rather than defend mine!" - Rex_Mundi
And therefore "isn't real"
I don't get this...
Assuming a fully materialistic world, then yes.
Did he killed himself?
Petrified_Discord: Haha no
He's killing himself!
Silver_Spoon, just be careful to never make the mistakes that cannot be undone.
tSparx: Darn :D
/me is gonna start a new planet without religion so there are less wars and arguments
We made up names for everything, language. The fact that these things also hold meaning to us must be "delusion" to you also then.
MLP_Brovakiin: May I join you on this planet?
MLP_Brovakiin there would be more wars instead....
MLP_Brovakiin you would have to remove the human factor.
cachi01|phone: Most wars are started due to religion :/
I just finished watchinf return of jafar and now I'm wondering... why didn't they just destroy jafar's lamp at the end of the first one? o.o
MLP_Brovakiin: Man, you think atheists aren't gonna find just as many things to argue about? It's a human thing, not just a religious thing
MLP_Brovakiin: the more solutions we make the the more problems that surface to replace them.
lol
I am not a religious man. I will not add more to this conversation.
The deadly mistakes are obvious. The ones that can end freedom... well, they get a lot of good publicity.
tSparx: We would argue about what is on tv, not who to praise!
MLP_Brovakiin and most of them by atheists.... Dude if u make a planet full of atheists everyone would do whatever the fuck they want
MLP_Brovakiin: most wars in the past were caused IN THE NAME of religion, but even if we didn't have it, there's always something else to argue about
That would have saved a lot of time and pain, wouldn't it
Kandarihu|1978: better than I could have said. I'm a filly, not a Philosopher
:P
MLP_Brovakiin: I'd contend that NONE of the major wars in the last hundred years were started due to religion/
war on terror
idk haha i dont even know if ive watched the movie :P
But that's a stupid argument
DIRTY MUSLIM TURRISTS
jews?
tSparx that is't true
On my planet if shit goes down, I would personally ice whatever mother trucker who dares stand in my way :D
That's just an argument for argument's sake
tSparx, the worst mass casualty events in the 20th century were caused by atheists. And the two worst ones weren't even a matter of war.
Buytoast: Is a euphemism
Because the words clearly do have meaning to me
Canadian_Brony: Oh yeah?
tSparx WWII
What is this?
Uh... friendship is magic? Respect peoples opinions anypony? :S
Canadian_Brony: Started due to HItler's acts of agression
OvergrownPegasus411: Agreed
tSparx partially against religion
bunny1
tSparx if not mainly
ohey Bunnies
Hey everybody, let's all attack Scoot-Scootaloo. He is probobly siting there with a troll face for starting this...
I swear. Scoot is streaming almost nothing but creepypasta and otherwise depressive videos.
Bunny!
How dare you still argue against Rex "King of the World" Mundi! Don't you know his word is automatically truth?
Scoot-scootaloo can u stream ready to die? Pls :)
Canadian_Brony: He had plenty of other reasons he was going to war besides his hatred of jews.
Guys, BUNNIES. Look at all of these BUNNIES! :D
>be Afk for a while > return to Religious wars Theist vs atheist i better go AFK again
tSparx they were a factor.
/me decides to let this handle itself and not get involved
Um... Hi. What are we watching?
Aww, bunnies! ^^
Canadian_Brony: Like his belief that Germany was due to rule the world
Wait, Scoot-Scootaloo's streaming?
I wanna see more videos like don't hug me I'm scared. *insane face*
Canadian_Brony: But they weren't the root cause.
A human?
/me Drags DoctoDoctorWho back into the arguement.
00,03Eh, no regrets.
Rotten fruit?
StinkomanFan, eeyup. It's his last time streaming in a long time.
tSparx also, who caused 9/11?
What is man but a miserable pile of secrets?6_9
What is this?
Canadian_Brony: That wasn't a war.
This is adorable! :)
tSparx Bush declared war
Canadian_Brony bush.....
BUSH
Rex_Mundi: But enough talk. Have at you!
I HATE HIM
Hey what about all of that shizzle about palestine vs isreal?
that is all
FUCKING BUSH
That was a war about religion
So I missed the Requests?
Canadian_Brony, Islamic terrorists caused 9/11
Can we watch cupcakes?
No
/me becomes switzerland and MINDS ITS OWN F***ING BUSINESS, like a boss.
Canadian_Brony: It's not a declared war. Only the US congress can declare war, the President can't
YOUR OPINION IS DIFFERENT THEN MINE. THUS I SHALL ARGUE FOR A FREAKIN LONG TIME
Pegasister6414: Nope
wait, the Crusades was about Religion
/me Invades Switzerland.
Medic is hero!
I needed something to watch while I played Dragon Quest VIII and I'm not even sure what this is.
O hi, Medic.
nevermind
MEEEEDIIIC
FlutterMEDIC: Last hundred years. I'm not arguing that religion hasn't caused tons of bloodshed -- totally has!
Love this video
Dovah: lol
Yay uplifting video
MEDIC!
I'm out of this conversation
oh i saw this vid, is good vid
FlutterMEDIC: But I'm saying, we can (and even have) found something else to war about
00,10knew this was coming
even with medic saying it
tSparx, Congress doesn't declare war. Congress has to give the President the authorization to declare war, and they did.
In anycase, im not a believer in a fully materialistic reality. Spiritualism exists. Not soul crushingly depressingly that way...
*crosses hooves for creepy video*
This video is appropriate
I love Shwiggen's videos.
inspireing qoute right here get ready
woot woot
tSparx: albeit that most of these wars are REALLY pointless
ahahaha, he's run out of shit to shovel into his argument
Medic for president 2012
HATS
Charlie Chaplin?
00,03Eh, I'm getting bored of feels~
OvergrownPegasus411: I want creepy videos too. :P
Cypresswolf: Charlie Chaplin
00,03even bad feels
Dr goku for presidente de mexico :3
Scoot-Scootaloo: you a damn Troll, you. :|
Scoot-Scootaloo that's not a good sign
is it?
I'm just saying: WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, all caused for reasons that weren't religious.
Who here wants feels? I so want feels
IMO wars were made for countries to boost their economies
I kinda like Buddism, they are just like we are Buddists and we don't care if you are not
okay, yeah, I'm sick of the feels too
Medic is best president
guess what role Charlie played in this movie.
FlutterMEDIC hitler
cachi01|phone: a PARODY of Hitler
Kettle?
Even if Afghanistan was.
Im too much of a history buff to just simply say wars are caused by religion or not. its never that simple, even the crusades had complex social-economic reasons.
This video needs to be redone with MvM assets
What to watch next.... I don't have Aladdin 3 so...
FlutterMEDIC yeah i remember when it was streamed here lol
YOU HAVE THE POWER!
It's pretty impressive that a silent comedian could use such powerful words.
Rex_Mundi: even if religions didnt start wars directly, they were great tools
MLP_Brovakiin: Jews are the same way too. They're a non-proselytizing religion
BEST. CHARLIE. CHAPLIN. EVER!
Hello everypony
YAAAAAAAY
Well, Charlie Chaplain played both an expy of Hitler, and a Jew living in an expy of 1930's Germany.

AJIsAwesome: i hear it's beautiful there
FlutterMEDIC: It's AMAZING there.
oh god not this pmv
SO MANY HELLO :S
This PMV is overrated
AJIsAwesome: I still have to do more research and learn Japanese :D I dont know exactly where I would go
Dovah: Medics speech was, beutiful...:'(
*glomps NotIshBestPony not matter if he wants to or not*
I went to Japan during the summer a couple of years ago.
AJIsAwesome: if it werent for one thing...
/me believes that all people can be good, no matter who they are or what they believe...
StinkomanFan I agree with you
oni_link: Me too. I'm trying to take some Japanes classes.
StinkomanFan Nope
tSparx, like Egyptians who just elected hardline Muslim Brotherhood associate Muhhamed Morsi, who is leading the charge to reform the Islamic Caliphate?
CCCP yep
derpl.
Why not praise zoidberg?
AJIsAwesome: you know what i mean about Nagasaki right?
Hai, bronies and pegasisters! ^^
StinkomanFan: Well, all things are overrated when it gets too much attention. At least that's my opinion.
AJIsAwesome: any luck ? I have to look around to see if my community has any classes
NotIshBestPony *hugs passionatly*
Ohai Pinkie1028
did my chat die?
hello Pinkie1028
hi Pinkie1028
oni_link: Nope.
:D
woot woot
Awww yeah
YAY
FlutterMEDIC: Radiation?
Kandarihu|1978: B) The politics of a post-revolution society are almost always confusing, and Egypt's no exception.
So much happies.
AJIsAwesome: damn. that sucks
Anti-sadness batteries, FIRE!
AJIsAwesome: you sound like a hipster, ITS TOO MANESTREAM
/me throws CCCP off a clip even though he is clearly not IshBestPony
YAY moodchanger :)
I made a song about fluttershy
ingwaz: DAT HORSE PUN.
*cliff
AJIsAwesome: well...thats part of the answer i'm looking for...
/me h
/me is being thrown off with all these mood swings
anyway brb everypony I'll be back in a few hours
Smile, smile, smile!
Kandarihu|1978: Essentially what happened is that the candidates most egyptians wanted were eliminated because the vote was spread too thin, and he was the guy they had left
seeya Dovah
Just think about what would happen if Fred or Shirley Phelps got elected as president of the US... :D
I wish I had the Hunchback of Notre Dame o_o
/me smiles against his will
ingwaz: To be honest, I'm not a hipster. I was just joking.
?me sings alond and smiles
/me takes DoctoDoctorWho's teeth while he smiles
Whoa, shes awfully close to all them fillies
ingwaz: I don't mind overrated things, like Past SIns.
/me sings along
ALONE
I hate getting stuck in an RPG, but whenever I look up what to do, I say "How the hell was I supposed to know that?!"
tSparx, Morsi IS a Fundamentalist Muslim
/me sings along and smiles
FlutterMEDIC: What were you asking about then?
oni_link: http://derpy.me/37rhT
Alchemist: Huh, that would be weird, because Phelps turned irl trolling into a religion
CrossChop114: hahaha I hate those moments
AJIsAwesome: i just think its a bit silly to think something is bad simply because its very popular
AJIsAwesome:...it's history...you know...the bomb and the rebuilding.
I'm nowhere close to being hipster, but I am always the one to something different.
Petrified_Discord lol
Petrified_Discord: :D this stream in a nutshell :D
Yeah. I'm playing Dragon Quest VIII. Damn good game.
is there a religious argument going on, those never end well
tSparx: did they really? if so, thats extremely noble of them
/me smiles
Bah guys! See you at first episode of season 3!

Come on everypony smile smile smile!
ingwaz: They did in fact. There's a not-small coptic community in my hometown, and they're SO grateful for that

SUNSHONE

Rex_Mundi: true, but what Im getting at is saying that muslims are bad is a silly generalization
Pinkie Pie used: Summon Parade
NotIshBestPony: /me gets new teeth from pp stashed all across equestria in case of teeth emergencies
So many happies.
tSparx: are you egyptian yourself?

oh god, indie pop

10How are things down your end?
OF THE*
cachi01|phone: I know :)
Laggy
otakon what are attempting to ask?
<:
Why do people gotta hate? Hm? Why can't we love and tolerate EVERYONE? Regardless of their religion or lack thereof, regardless of what bands they're in or into, of what they like or don't, of whatever philosophical beliefs they hold? I don't have enough energy to hate much :P
MFW RainBroDash, is here, in bronystate, after how long...?
im having spagetti and balls of meat
tSparx: because we are humans.
bicyclerepairman my bike is broken and I don't know how to fix it sixth super strength
spaghetti <3
With*
SPAGHETTI
smoke weed everyday <3
LOL
tSparx, I find people hate simply out of ignorance, they dont understand something, thus they fear it, that leads to hate
XDDD
SPAGHETTI is in bloom
Yay this :D
Spaghetti?
someone send me the video link to this
:D
Spaghetti is best spaghetti
this is fucking great
I HOPE SHE MAKES LOTSA SPAGHTTI
tSparx, we have to be able to see hatred and evil for what it is. Returning hatred with hatred is only making the problem worse. But ignoring that bad things is just as bad.
This ruined the song!
emenim i think says this
StinkomanFan: It's a STONE, Luigi :|
I think Mike mighta gone back to sleep... :c

the bronies are rougenore (me), Dragonmaster, Latencey, and others
Rex_Mundi: I was lucky, I never went through a "I'm too old for [x]" phase xD
So...why does the monkey talk again?
00,10feels like this show is trying to teach.
AjIsAwesome give me his name in spanish and maybe i remember
STOOP KID WON'T LEAVE HIS STOOP

tSparx: do you have minecraft
dat racist monkey
lol
RougeFlutter: I do not, nor do I intend to get it anytime soon. I already have enough time sinks :P
I actually came to a crossroads when I was about to turn 13. Whether I was going to act my age, and just do the things that a teenager was expected to be into, or stick with what I love. Tiny Toon Adventures premiered that September, and I chose the latter.
Seriously, I DISPISE monkeys
Who voices Darwin?
tSparx: Oh ok lolz
...That Rhino has hair.
Kandarihu|1978: Good choice.
You die being a good show. Or you live long enough to see yourself becoming a shitty show. Example: the simpsons
Minecraft server: mc.emenbeesmp.com
00,03Don't rhino's have hair?
you know what a great show was? ANIMANIACS
00,10uhhhhhh rino with hair?
//Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
NotIshBestPony: idk but i hear his voice in alot of comercial nowadays
StinkomanFan I think its a Javan Rhino
Wait is this episode recieved from Australia?
Scoot-Scootaloo: i met tara strong today
00,03RougeFlutter: Don't overdo it, eh?
FlutterMEDIC: totally
Scoot-Scootaloo: yes sir, ill stop
The white Rhino is extinct btw

00,10they do have hair but not like that
Bronysith how was dragoncon? Was it good?
00,03Bronysith: Oh cool! Do you have pics?
cachi01|phone: Or you bow out gracefully while it's a good show.
rhino*
i thought that was iliggeal
Scoot-Scootaloo: yea, trying to get it all loaded up on DA stash
The monkey isn't being racist. It's being a monkey. Comparing people of African descent to monkeys... THAT'S racist.
taking a rinos horn
Did you guys like Freakazoid? That was my favorite cartoon next to the 90s animated Batman
Scoot-Scootaloo: she remembered you

Rex_Mundi: i loved rugrats, but not that new one with the teens
00,03Oh lord...
Ed, Edd, n' Eddy was a great show.
AJIsAwesome: they need to bring back that show :( i used to love all the stabs at pop culture they did and the bits where Freakazoid butchered classical pieces always made me laugh
00,03Maybe she remembered me for my good loks~
00,03looks*

FlutterMEDIC: the later episodes got stale though :/

00,03Dude, these monkeys are creepy as shit, and I streamed my creepiest video ever...
Darwin is voiced by Tom Kane http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kane
i have to say my favorite joke from Freakazoid was the lipsync bit.
seriously, eating your young seems ver counter productive
Even after I was over that "respectfully boycotting Nick" phase, I never really got into Nick.
otakon: Agreed.:D
the imagination video was awesome
except for that one part O-O
TIM CURRY voices NIgel, BLAHSDLKAJRLDAJDF
Darwin is a coward
The Thornberrys? I remember this show!
Swims with clothes. Clothers are dry
<.<

Detective Conan, Cowboy Bebop...
cachi01|phone: Cartoon physics.:D
GIANT MONKEYS
tSparx: I like Conan but they never let US solve the damn mystery bc they don't give us all the clues Conan finds

RADIO GAGA

AJIsAwesome: Zoltar, it was Space Ghost Coast to Coast
Nigel lol
Donnie is voiced by Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers
CCCP You will be back, bro.......(hugs you)

Btw, what did I miss? I left at Satan thing. :P
Nigel is a good man.
00,03Speaking of Steam names...
Well that 's a weird way to say "Hop Skip and a Jump", Nigel..............
Foster is 6 years old i think
Rex_Mundi: and god do we want Foster's back, because of 2 things. 1) It was a great show. 2) Lauren Faust produced it.
:o
Tis but a scratch
00,03So while I was on vacation, my bro revived my steam account!
tis a flesh wound
Just a flesh wounf
D
Anyone excited for Lauren's new show, Wander Over Yonder?

You'll get the ponies you deserve, not the ponies you need
RougeFlutter: Yeah, you didn't break a single rule :P
yeah, RougeFlutter
RougeFlutter: I have.
Lauren Faust was a crew animator on Iron Giant, so she didn't really- have much a say in it, but still cool!
Yep, we were saying earlier today how Ballad brought a lot of peeps here :)
Lauren also did the animation for "Cats don't Dance"

RougeFlutter: Not a TON though :)
Scoot-Scootaloo: ...i see an frcerv38

Scoot-Scootaloo: is that you?
cowvarkian, unless there's a proper explanation, you're just gonna have to suspend your disbelief for this.
bc I'm an angry gamer when the AI beats me
cowvarkian: no really, it's magic
bah, whatever
Vivix: Lauren also helped with the walk cycles and an episode "Codename: Kids Next Door"
Scoot-Scootaloo, where are you getting that name? I can't find it either
I'll believe its magic
Oh, cachi01|phone explained it.
Oh yeah, it really is magic, I'd forgotten :)
cowvarkian: it was a gift from a African Shaman that she saved the life of
orly
Durians? *Looks at Super Mario Sunshine*

Scoot-Scootaloo: frcerv38?
Mario taught me something? :o
Durian...why couldnt they follow the smell?
AJIsAwesome: those things were so much fun to kick around

SUNBEYA

Twilight Sparkle has a Nigerian cousin... he granted Eliza the gift of tongues :P

Sumica: i saw a cabbage guy cosplayer at dragoncon, he was extremely popular
Oh, Durian. Hey Scoot-Scootaloo speaking of Durians, mind streaming Sintel... for the feels?
:P
LURNING
AJIsAwesome: it was really annoying to just get it in the damn basket
Bronysith: awesome
FlutterMEDIC: Yep.:D
I used to always kick the Durians at the fruit vendors and try to kick it across the giant gaps in the walkways of the Plaza
OPTOMETRY FAIL

She can't speak to the insects, I see.
cachi01|phone: Because she admitted her secret.
cachi01|phone: Mystery
she revealed the secret or somethin
Or that
Kandarihu|1978: because insects are inferior beings
hmm, the TF2 beta is updating...
cachi01|phone: She can't admit it, or she loses her powers.

...WE NEED TO SHOW THE SCREW IN THE TUNA ONE
OR THE ONE WITH SUPERFISH
that was the first episode lol
lol how many times has he schanged his mind? :P
Man I haven't seen that show in years
"The United States Pony Club defines "pony" to be any mount that is ridden by a member regardless of its breed or size. Persons up to 25 years old are eligible for membership, and some of the members' "ponies" actually are full-size horses."
movie is horrible though
/me useless facts, but funny
FlutterMEDIC yeah the movie was bad
Vivix: that could also be taken out of context as well.
i :p too much :P
could be, I'm reading about the definition of pony in Wikipedia
if he had played moonlight sonata, then a secret passage would have opened up.
SMASHING
thats the only thing i know about this show.
lol
SLENDERMAN
lol nigel
00,03>New Two Best Freinds Play..

twilight_sprinkle: and NRAGHAGHAGH
00,03Overused game...
Scoot-Scootaloo, is dissapointed?
DO IT SCOOT-SCOOTALOO
Scoot-Scootaloo: They should do that.
FlutterMEDIC: yes and that :D
00,03Yeah, kind of :/
Scoot-Scootaloo, it's also-- so bland if you're not into slender
After watching Gigabit play slenderman yesterday, i dreamt of slenderman <.<
Scoot-Scootaloo thats what happens when you do an addictive game lol
lol i lol too much lol
ill be back later
00,03How many times have I streamed some slender...
Vivix: but it's so damn scary
0 i think
6I do the first two too much ^^
I must've missed it Scoot
I think about Mike too much
I don't think it is, mainly because I don't know any slender stuff
I found out what happends when you collect all 8 pages. You still get killed.:|
6xD
I startle- but you know-
mike thinks about mike too much
00,10got room for 2 more in mvm
I asked him how many times I've told him I love him and he said 6 WTF????
i would have loved to join but i dont have my laptop at the moment right now
lol
oi SuperBrony64 u here?
EDUCATION!
THe slender creators entry for Ludum Dare, however, is really cool
I've said it waaaaaay more times than that and I'll say it many, many more times :34
Sumica first join first serve ?
dammit one of my favorite artists just released a tune and i cant listen to it :(
another scary game is SCP Containment Breach
00,03I guess you can say that dance party was... heating up!
Vivix Slender is not HIS name.... His name is slenderman
11,02I'm here ^-^
Whats Slender man?
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
00,10yeah TheGreatAndPowerfulT
cachi01|phone, the game is called Slender
6D:
Vivix yeah i know but some people call slenderman slender
I'm pretty sure slenderman was created by many people, but the creator of that specific game had a really cool entry for Ludum Dare
watch her lead them to the fire itself
6Why don't you go online through your PS3?
Pearly has returned
Vivix: another scary game is SCP Containment Breach
hi Pearly
i could do that i guess
FlutterMEDIC, yeah I kinda liked that one, was very unfinished when I tried ti though
Vivix slenderman was created for a somethingawful.com contest
hey FlutterMEDIC
...
cachi01|phone: he prefers his close personal friends call him slendy though
The story won
Ah, Slender looks a lot like "The tall man" from Yahtzees horror game series from--early 2000's
k ill do that lol
Rex_Mundi, Slenderman is an urban legend about a tall creature who kills and tortures random people, mostly children
6What's the artist called btw?
sounds about right
I'm back
for now
contrage
StinkomanFan just people that think their lifw has no value
It's a created legend, so not everyone thinks its interesting
6:O
or bratkilla
Those are his victims
Hmm . . . I'veseen this before, but can't put my hoof on it.
BOIDS
its kinda confusing cuz theyre the same people, but he just has seperate names for serperate types of music
I thought the tall man was scarier, but he was part of the story in the game

6Brb,gonna get my earphones..
So how about them Redsocks?
AJIsAwesome, aah- never seen anyone play it to the end
Actually, the Slenderman seems to kill at random,
dues ex monkenimas
Vivix: ending = death
semi-random, but yeah
slender looks a lot like this guy http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/275/005/7c0.jpg who predates him
some days I just wanna watch ponies and freak people out
eugh, stereotypical teenage girl

Uncle tall is a pretty cool guy
MMMMM
ill just use my phone actually lol
pretzels and thousand island dressing
CHat derped. Who pinged me last?

So, what about Krastos the glue maker?
AJIsAwesome, aah- never seen anyone play it to the end
"Lol, I wish someone would give me a dollar every time I told you I love you. Then I'd use all that money to come see you and tell you I love you more, then use that money for uhhhh... whatever you want me to :D" That would be wonderful XD
Don't worry, Slenderman only kills those who believe in him
Vivix: I saw a video.
omg
This
i belive in slenderman
And the more you know of him and the more you believe...

One trick I like to use in the "split second spin" technique. It may be a split second, but you actually cover a great distance when you do it.
/me fuck da police
Kurraso PG-13 comedies are scary?
(\^3^/)
Good luck SB!
SuperBrony64 no you don't

Hello, Ninjazz.

/me noms on Ninjazz
6I might actually go on Skype more often..
/me ..... old enough c.c
Kurra i like PG stuff more than PG-13 + higher things too
Polydunami: But the books aren't bad compared to others like them.
alliteration :3
Bloody ninjas and their assassinations.
6*backs_away*
and then a goomba kills him
I've been impartial to R and G since I was like 10 haha
It's always my fault. And I never knew what I did.
Actually, I don't have much of an opinion on the series myself, tSparx; I have no experience with them :$
ikr tSparx
/me is content with the nomming.

tSparx: WHat's R and G?
Super Mushroom?
My Skype's ShibaruRyu 8)
Guys im back

Twilight books are bad but the movied ARE FUCKING HORRIBLE

AJIsAwesome: G is for little kids, R is 17+
SuperBrony64 spin from Galaxy
I LOVE MARIO!!!
SuperBrony64: Use the split second spin technique!
AND ninjas didn't ONLY assinsate! They're like Japan's version of spies.
The mario series is all about inertia
I saw a bunch of things that just desensitized me a lot when I was like, 8 or 9....
Oh I hate those boomerang guys....
AJIsAwesome: Because we used to be a protestant country :P
DEATH!
:I

tSparx: Ok.
Canadian_Brony: thought that was the huge one
dumbass
Know what I want? the hammer bros. suit

MARIO IS A BOSS OF VIDEO GAMES
But they do assassinate, yes?
I WANT SMB3 FURSUIT POWERS!
lol
Canadian_Brony: How dare you insult SB
My dad's attitude was, "If you're old enough to want to watch/read/hear it, you're old enough to watch/read/hear it."
Canadian_Brony: No, just curious.:D
Xd
I'm sure they've done their fair share.
STAH DAIING
SB64 i expected you would do better
Therefore you are chatsassin.
yeah, pretty much same here, tSparx

Do I get chatmedal?

Bye Daygon
Daygob have fun!
Daygon: say high to ceiling cat
Bye Daygon :)
for me
Daygon: Bye!
Honestly? I would only play this with the freaking original NES controller. A Wiimote would just be so much to worry over.
Kandarihu: Hard =/= fun, imo
chatship troopers
Takes place during the Civil Chatwar, during which the mods split in two and started wacking each other with chatnoodles.
Befriend the pirana plants
Tell this man to stop jumping on pirahna plants

And large trouts.

Hi tigher1001
You can hit em with fireballs when you have that upgrade

Bits an' pieces.
The new Super Mario Bros game will be all about COINS!
Millions of them
6I told you I can't! D:
SuperBrony64: I would have thought you would have been mln on this
tigher1001: it calls Luigi to do the heavy lifting
Lonko: fuck that
cowvarkian: Hes not a smart snake
you still are
tigher1001: You mean the pirhanna plans, or the flying turtles?
Yay
cowvarkian: It is the Jew-edition
Need to pick that up sometime.
I remember something about otakon stealing Val's trident. And some weird shipping with daribot.
Yay!
Lonko: nice
WAT. O_O
13LAME
tigher1001 it brings in Luigi to solve the level for you
SB64 play it with 4 players
Unless you say "Candlejack" out load, then you would be ca-
tSparx: the cube
SuperBrony64: It wouldnt. :P We love you.
Mario will be wearing a Kippa
tSparx: I presumed they meant the easy mode
what is the plot of this game
Mushroom house
6TELL THAT TO MY MOM BRO
CCCP that is suicide
CCCP: only he plays every player?
Idk what that is, I haven't played any mario's :P
We still haven't figured out what an attraction to robots would be called.
Lonko, dat stereotype
Biggysweet are u kidding me......
Canadian_Brony i know thats why its funny
Mechanosexual?
You feeling lucky, punk?
Kandarihu: What... Jews are wearing Kippas
inb4 no items
lol
cowvarkian yus
tSparx: that's okay, it was new to this one
Kandarihu: stereotypes are fun if you ont take them seriously
^ random tangent
CCCP: yes on the sax?
Bottom riht!
D:
bottom riiiight
Hmmm.
You hardly ever use mini shrooms in this game

I've been watching vids of this, but never played it before :)
cowvarkian what sax?

Nuuuuu!

+999999901

But yay! Stuff!
I ate cookies just now
Androfelia?

I wanna watch MLP xD
*philia
But that's android.
Thanks.
tSparx dont say that
Exactly what I was going to say.
Bank 'em like a Jew
fleshlight+ ?
Hack Mario's file to be a 3D pony/
...
CCCP: I wanna watch MLP:FiM, G4*
Like they did in SM64.
tSparx never. EVER. Request ponies.
my little programmer
1 coin
I'm still ashamed that I even get that joke.
tSparx it doesnt work like that
Cookies
Kurra: make you small, and nimble, but you still die when hit
13WELL Can you talk shibaru?
lol
Kurra there might be a hack for that
<.<
Not that the rest of the robot mattered any way.
I wasn't requesting anything, I was suggesting that I might leave the stream to do it myself >_>
everyone else did too, they just won't own up to it
SB there isn't
goodnight everypony. Stay pony my friends.
Maybe 8)
Kurra there are some ponies for brawl
g'night Rex_Mundi
You should see the hax for SM64, is glorious. Or silly.
Rex_Mundi: Night!
this lel is easy
has anyone played NSMB2 on 3ds? if so,is it good?
tSparx: kinda want them to stream gen 1 and see how much people leave
I am not a monstrous fan of Mario, but I am a monstrous fan of G4 <3
Why do we not ask for ponies? Do we get G3 or something instead?
6Can you do group calls?
Yes
tigher1001: Don't tempt the gods
Silver_Spoon: Invariably
Kurra: Like the one that changes the textures to NES ones
First thing I see when I look at this chat was "Fleshlight."
Silver_Spoon: When Caramel is streaming
13I CAN
tSparx: I just enjoy watching SB play it >.>
YESSSSS
Yeah...
SHINE SB SHINE!!!
6OHO

What the actual fuck?
THE LEVEL CAN'T EVEN HANDLE ME RIGHT---aw.
hmm
0,14*literal

I blame kirz.
Silver_Spoon: no ... seaponys
Most awkward one I've had today.
ah shit son

/me has a long weekend
Get dat P
so THAT's where the secret . . . isn't
/me slow clap
but...I like seaponies, tigher1001
Yeah
SB64 I think so too :P
/me golf clap?
Wondering what took the most awkward award of all times.
Seaponies are good, the rest isn't :P
Oh my god
Mario is probably on drugs right now. Chasing those Coins is the equivalent of chasing the purple dragon!
:D
cowvarkian: Me too, but if I stay up too late it'll suddenly be 06:30 (GMT-5) xD
"MUST GET ALL THE COINS!"
Rainbow of Darkness...wat?

:P
6BEHOLD
Man, you youngins have it SO easy these days.
Lonko: I know I am. :P
I'm torn between being ashamed for having taken part in it, and laughing my ass off at it.
Mario, it is impossible to get all those coins! - NOOOO
Silver_Spoon: SOOP BE DO SHOOP SHOOPBE DO
/me knows that so many people in the world have never done drugs >_> :D
bad idea
haha
and suddenly fai
sorry
*fail
tSparx: I havent?
0,14why not both?
Fire Flower
you would think mario would get tired of this shit
i hope sea ponies make a debut in season 3,if they hint at a crystal empire which may mean a form of crystal pony then im hopin for some sea ponies :D
Back in my day, you had no analog control and all the enemies moved way faster and the scrolling screens would pin you dead in 5 seconds and....
Probably.
Wassat
tSparx: is that east coast?
Ashamed about laughing about it.
I feel bad for mario
6I KILLED MY CLAN AND I LIKED IT
It involved shipping Bronystate with 4chan and discussing the anatomy involved therein.
or just a different country >.>
HoodyNinja: I mean so many people have ridiculous ideas about what weed does, compared to like acid etc.
Kurra: Back in my days, every game had a water level
Kurra: back in mooma's day? quarters...
cowvarkian: It's Midwest USA
ah, ok
and I am back. What's happening?
*momma's
13Lol gay
cowvarkian: St. Louis specifically
Shizu looked into chat and just walked right back out.
Dovah: Nopony knows
Back in my days......... Wait im 14.
Dovah: SB64's playing Mario
hey
cachi01|phone: Hahaha
cool
I can only imagine the watthefawk-ery.
It was pretty bad.
back in my day we playe with mud and sticks
:D
I GUESS YOU CAN SAY HE FOUGHT FIR *puts on sunglasses* WITH FIRE YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
fire
I mean... all the CP.
No fireworks for you :(
>_
>_>
<_<
o3o;
Back in my day they had already made Spyro the Dragon :P
if you get 99 lives in this game mario plays with out a hat
tigher1001: Fire lost
FIRFIRFIRFIRFIRFIR
Firpile
Good luck!
To be fair, it was also really late and we were all probably all half-crazy.
mario has terrible hat hair
Also, it was all my fault, and I'm completely ashamed of it.
13Sup nigs, how it is?
Alright, thumbs up? Let's do this.
dat pink fat ass (srry for language
meh, you?
Everybody chill out! He got this!
Canadian_Brony, we were proud that we had to blow on the cartridge to make it work! *shakes cane at*
Although I am, as previously stated, also laughing my ass off at the memory.
That was awkward and you should feel awkward.
/me claps
Like a baws
When I was born, it was already a bit before the SNES era; and I didn't even about it until I was maybe four or five :P
6Anyway,videocall is about the most I can do..I have to stay soundless -.-
6Wb
And that was about 1994/95 :$
Gotta love Jewrio
is that weegee
all the vertical towers
Kurra: Oh no that's not true, we were still in Famicon when I was a *little* kid, but the first console we owned in middle school was a playstation
lol im trying to take the tiles out, and i put a hole through the drywall :P
back in my day we didnt need no DLC! lol im lookin at YOU Capcom :|
I still blame Meanwhile for escalating it, though.
this is really more entertaining
I love my nes and my snes
It would have been an interesting line of topic, atleast.
Kurra and I had to manualy jump-start my disc. THAT is harder than blowing on a cartridge
I blame you.
Even though i have like 5 games for each
I hardly can tab out of Bronystate
I don't know what we're talking about.
Oh it's Meanwhile.
it's sad that cool games like SMB3 and the original Zelda.... people today miss out on. They really are still fun, if sorta meh on graphics, but they were such great challenges.
My prime video game years were N64
That thing is so retarded
But I blame you.
i got a NES but its a pain to set up
I also love mah N64 :)

Let's play the blame game.
Remember that time we discussed the various anatomies of shipping Bronystate IRC with 4chan?
I'm playin n64 right now

Okay, the next time Stream freezes, I'm leaving :)
NOW PRESENTING SuperBrony64 WITH HIS LATEST SINGLE, GIRAFFES IN THE AIR!
Mike disappeared again :c
P.S. paintball is still best of the FPSes, the graphics never glitch and the feedback is INCREDIBLE
cachi01|phone: ummmm /]
I remember a commercial praising the amazing graphics of The Legend of Zelda for the NES :3
grey man
Or, airsoft and paintball.

He was trying to tell us a story and got COMPLETELY DERAILED when we noticed something he said in passing.

wirisme (\
SuperBrony64 you missed every single coin . . .

Those are no ordinary Mushrooms
They are MAGICAL
This one was also my fault, because I was stupid enough to mention Homestuck.
When I get paid, I'm gonna restore my paintball gun and go play some games. :3
Ouch

Polydunami: I remember playing zelda on the NES

"You want this coin?" "I want it."
I've actually played it too, HoodyNinja :3
Hey, can you transform into a Statue with the Tanooki Suit in this? Is the Tanooki Suit in this game?

Polydunami: I believe they did, if I'm not misremembering.
Polydunami super game boy adapter

Were they GBC games?
kirz was on the panel?
kirz was probably distracted.
Kurra: Wow
tSparx: yes.:D
You got some 'splainin to do.
Oh, yeah, I believe they were Gameboy Colour games
/me blushes
Sorry Toad, but my princess is in another castle.
I wonder if it's possible to lure Morton off the edge of the arena when he's spinning in his shell
0,14ahahahahhaha
My ocd forced me to get every level perfect when i played this game :S
the first LoZ game I played was Ocarina of Time. I never got into Zelda until the OoT 3D was announced
My mistake, games blurring together xD
tSparx: It's okay:)
My first Zelda game was... uh... the first Zelda game, but I didn't play it till like 2002 I think.... and I still haven't beat it
dat technique
Well, they were only for the SNES if you use the Super Gameboy, tSparx :$
Technique!

:D
USE THE TECHNIQUE! TECHNIQUE!
XD
lol fail

WOOOOOOOW
I guess my first Zelda game must've been Ocarina, then. Hm *shrug*
ROFL
Lmfao
My first Zelda was Wind Waker.
everyone died :(
I forgot if my first Zelda game was 1 or 2. It was so long ago
well, you see, this one time, at band camp...
ah yes, wind . . .
That was my first Zelda too, OoT.
Your misfortunes are quite funny, comrade SuperBrony64
My first zelda was wind waker i think but i rented it
Yes
We are all dead

Hello :)
What instrument you play? The flesh trombone?

lHello Gamer_Luna :)
Hi Gamer_Luna
Never played windwaker, is it good? I've heard mixed things
ahahahaa
Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Ocarina of TIme, Spirit Tracks, Legend of Zelda, Legend of Zelda 2, Skyward Sword.
imagine a grey man meme
Hi Gamer_Luna :)
Nearly ten years since it was released, tSparx
possible missing secret
Drinking tea :0
hi Gamer_Luna
:)
Gamer_Luna: Hello!
Let me see the zelda games i have
LunarSS: I loved every Zelda game (except those evil PC ones, but I never played them)
oh hey the liar is in chat
Oh, and Link to the Past.
Also, LunarSS, Wind Waker is a fun game; don't let people convince you otherwise :|
Bronysith: which one
Polydunami: I'm old enough to feel old, but not old enough to drink
God how weird would it be if it turned out someone in chat was /actually/ on that panel.
cowvarkian: gamerluna
I actually never played Link to the Past
Saxy was.
I think they just come from the tenis court, people dropping them from the top of the Burj-Al Arab hotel o.o
Or he was there, at least.
LunarSS: Wind Waker is a FANTASTIC game.
oh, are we doing this again, Bronysith
tSparx: 19?
GNIGHT everypony
Bronysith Richard Nixion is not on this chat
AJIsAwesome: Indeed
0,14I was in the audience, I do NOT have the courage to go on there
HoodyNinja: 20. *shrug*
night Bronysith
Okay, guess I'll have to play it
Random Hello, everyone.
on it, ran it, same diff
XDDDD
tSparx: You're not missing out on much.
night Bronysith
hi Ninjazz
0-Up
Night Bronysith
Nigth, Bronysith. Sleep well.
Only way I played that game, tSparx, was on an emulator :S
Ninjazz: Hello!
0,14o_o
Bronysith: Night!:)
You would, Saxy.
for Zelda games, I have OoT 3DS, OoT downloaded for the Wii, the first and second games from the 3DS Ambassador program, and Skyaward Sword
You would if NASA girl were there.
HoodyNinja: 1992 :)
Ok i have Zelda 1 and 2 both are gold cartridges, twilight princess, OoT, Skyward sword and thats it..... The other ones i have them in my emulator
That's less reason to do it...
ok someone has to stream slender
0,14^
Anyone own the CDi Zelda games?:D
The 3DS games I've never even played. I have the Majora's Mask gold cartidge still
link to the past is probably my favourite
I'm sure there exists a girl somewhere who'd find that...impressive. But I doubt NASA girl is it.
Should've been here last night, tigher1001 :S
0,14if it probably didn't break chat rules, I'd tell you just what that panel consisted of
Alright, point taken.
OH i also own OoT 3D and 4 swords adventure anniversary
use the pow block to get coins during the windstorm
Polydunami: darn
We have imaginations, Saxy.
Okay okay so....
Has anyone read Foal in the basket?
Majora's Mask will always be my fav
I grew up with Mario, with which I have too many games to count
0,14Fair enough
Let's REALLY go back in time.... who here ever flew model rockets? :D
tSparx: same
:(
Is the grey man a troll?
Kurra: Me.
I wouldn't know if I went off and looked for them
DerpyMuffins im on CH 4 so far
he is THE troll
I'm old enough to remember pogs
eeeenope
Even though that was relatively late into my childhood (I guess I would've been in 6th grade)
Chapter 2 right now
nice savr
nice!
gotta do it during a windstorm
Who remembers Sock Em' Boppers?
AJIsAwesome: I do!
Ima die happy
/me made out of sight flights on a C engine once oh XD it took forever to find the rocket again

AJIsAwesome: Lost mine
13I'm a troll

Indeed, I remember those, AJIsAwesome
:megusta:
Did anyone here get the Power Glove?:D
I had oldschool toys when i was young
Yay!
Although I have to confess I've never been on a panel like that.
My family is poor
We should do Kerbals sometimes this week
I played the Virtual Boy once in a store! :D :D
The last convention I went to was really bad.
FillyFlam: >?
Brb DINNER!
Kurra: did you eyes explode?
I'm a Shibaru
RIGHT

RIGHT
I saw a panel where some kid ranted poorly about localization.

Go down.

And then there was the obligatory Hetalia panel.
Left
Right
SuperBrony64 go back to the previous level and find the secret
go right
no
:troll: right
And the equally-obligatory "ship everything with everything else" panel.
Ooh. The cannon looks inviting.
tSparx: I know, it never made much sense to me either. I mean, they were like filled with air.
you are THE shibaru
Alright, I said I'd leave the last time the stream stopped, and I'm still back when he was fighting the sand-bowser
Nah, actually the Virtual Boy was really great 3D, just it was only 1 bit vectors. The mask of it was heavy too. And only red colors.
la
i love this music :$
do do doo LA
Or 2 bit monochrome red.
theres only two secret levels in this game :(
So g'night everypony, see you tomorrow (or later tonight if I can't sleep :P)
ninight tSparx
Tata tSparx
tSparx: Night!
its soo happy :)
Drunk hobo panel?
SuperBrony64 the secret here will put you in the cannon. The secret is a warp pipe on the ceiling. It will be one of three after the flag.

It's rules, not poetry.
heys guys, elts all join in lecturing the rulebreakers!
Yeah sorry...... Even thought its fake sorry

Yup
whenever i try to scroll up through the chat i end up rolling my browser up above the screen
xisbestchemical: Very carefully
The person who got banned posted a link about the two forbidden words
6o.o

How do they expect us to give them our money when we can't even buy the episodes in canada.
Brad__: DAMN YOU JUSTIN BIEBER!
season three?
part of the personal story, infiltrate pirates
cursing lesson
:3
Nothing is there, no season 1, no season 2.
PillowPony rule thirty-four?
PillowPoni|Lurking was one of them the....the C word
season 3 comes out in octobwer
yes octobwer is the proper spelling
Octobwerfest
Octo Bear
genius
what do i do to add channels to the irc
cowvarkian made correct guess. But yeah they got a ban for that.
Octobwer Marwch Septwember
xisbestchemical: What client are you using?
I like the personal story mechanic. The fact that it's even a little different depending on choices really makes it more fun.
I mean, its easy enough to watch it for free.... but gotta support the creators and all.....
God: finally, and nobody believed me, but now i have proof that God said its octowber!
when they were chanting Kirby Kirby... I thoght they said Derpy
wait, who got banned?
I say we replace the month of May with something more assertive, like "Will".
xisbestchemical: nice name. PPG reference?
idk
Petrified_Discord: The default Brony-State irc.
ikr
Dat kik lol
octowber is definitely a magic time of year
xisbestchemical: type "/join channelname" or "/list"
PillowPoni|Lurking: FINALLY SOMEONE GETS IT

Who got kicked?

What's up, Shizu?

NotIshBestPony; someone got banned this morning for posting S3 stuffs.
13if only i were not so conservative with power...
NotIshBestPony: apparently joking counts as RP as well
SuperBrony64: lol your chat message appeared before you died on stream XD
and having an hour ban, but it somehow lasting for a day....
PillowPoni who was it?
I hope in October, we cooked some "Octo"puses. *drumshot*
11,02Yeah, there's a delay.

Oh
