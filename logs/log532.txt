11,01I know I should have spaced them.
Nittany_Discord: Then two per night

That stretcher is.... stretched
And besides, I get in trouble for making suggestions.
That joke
Dat stretcher
That repeated, repeated joke
Hey rainbow dash real quick can you do the sonic rainboom across the top screen please just real quick
Kandarihu you seem to get in trouble a lot when no one's looking.

Ohh, I thought you meant Madoka Magicka.

FallenLegacy: already bought it
FallenLegacy: its awesome
Nittany_Discord: Needs more L4D2. :D

icybeauti: I saw part of it, but I left before Meet the Pyro. But I watched it later. :P
so did i it pretty good
I bought it when it was on discount. I didn't get the best discount, but the best discount might've cost me even more anyway.
:D
DAYUM

AgentKalim: People got so excited over it....I didn't really see the point in it.

I'm stuck on the Vietnam Rescue Mission, though.
AgentKalim: Remeber, stuff gets to different people.
True

Nittany_Discord: it'S on steam, not too expensive. you should look up dayZ sometime. livestreams, let's plays, lots of them out there. the is so poular, it rose the sells of the game by 500%
I'll be in and out, I'm writting a chapter that's pretty damn important.
dat freeze
Freezcake
what happend
Everyone seems to be talking about dayZ lately. :P
09,01Hey guys
I'm not talking about Madoka Magica. Awesome series, though. But I'm talking about the game about wizards fighting monsters and each other.
you killed it
Cyrokinisis
NewDCD hi!
Heya NewDCD
what
Hello, NewDCD
09,01it's shameless DCD-self-promotion time
11,01Hi NewDCD
Nittany_Discord: it's zombie survuval combined with armas realism. really interesting
Dead
New DCD is out today
NewDCD: That's every time.
Hmm, stream is lagging
streams dead
NewDCD shameless? You has shame ^-^
Heh, my colleague at work mentioned Day Z to me.
AgentKalim: Tried it, if you go past the horrible clunky controls of arma 2, it's a ton of fun with friends
hiya NewDCD
what's Day Z
Time for a PPPPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRROMOTION
I refreshed. It seems better now.
brb
okay guys I'll be back gotta clear my cache
yeah refreshed
11,01Wednesday is Day Z.
Nittany_Discord: wats that?
11,01My internet is derping.
Spitfire!. What u doin!?.
K_A: Ah. We can use that.
09,01anybody looking to buy a Steam account? I have one here that's worth $780 and I'm selling it for $300. That's 60% of a discount! Or if you know anybody who might want to, well, point them at me. I kind of need the money to make something really awesome I'm sure all of you would enjoy.
10 hours
tell her he died
NewDCD: Dayum
dat midgit
300$ holy crap
All I have on Steam are a couple games. :x
Um, is that legal?
How long have you been streaming Nittany_Discord
NewDCD damn.... i dunno... im broke atm
And I don't even play TF2 that much.
NO NAKED SPITFIRE!!!
09,01it goes against the TOS but breaking TOS is not illegal
And one of them was a gift from you guys. XD
After two days of watching this, the chat is no longer reacting much. :P
nope
Socks
11,01If only Steam allowed sales.
11,01Valve could take a cut from game resales.
everyone sounds like they're from New York in 60's shows...
I know, innit grand?
11,01But I guess publishers would go apeshit like they do with Gamestop.
how is steam account worth money? can get 1 4 free.
I love it though. Makes the shpws more homelike for me.
Well, this is a parody of police shows from the 1950s-1970s
it has game son it
I bet
Devonx25: the games on it have a purchase value of $760
i guess?
Nittany_Discord: seriously i dont like how they get flank flustered over pre owned games
oh.
yeah... they suffer from that elusion they still own the game after you boguth it
fuckers
11,01But there's a market in game resale the doesn't involve punishing used game buyers.
and then they wonder why people pirate
i just download games for free.
11,01Bronysith: I know.
lol
11,01It's lost revenue. All they see is Gamestop getting rich from their work.
Devonx25: I do that all the time for my kindle
11,01I won't get started.
Somehow, I missed seeing the waiting room every time :P
please dont
dem orthodontix
11,01But Valve could work something out to allow digital resales.
Devonx25: undead patch?
?.
its a hack for steam
i remember this gamestop thing being discussed in here at least 3 times already B)
best receptionist ever.
09,01alternatively, if someone just reaaaaaaaaally wants to help me, instead of selling the Steam account, I'll use it as collateral as someone loans me the cash. I'd pay back little by little at the interest rate you propose, if that's the case
why are we using weemi now?
veemi
Dat sucking
In terms of console gaming, I generally don't like buying used unless I have a quality check like with Amazon's collectible ratings. I *HATE* scratched disks.
09,01but I'm kind of in a bind and need the money to get something important rolling
God damn why is it so hot in here.
Meanwhile: summer?
sorry Meanwhile
I hate summer.
Maybe it's just you :P
Meanwhile cuz ur mustach
11,01Mips was giving Sumica trouble, so he switched to Veemi.

So it looks different if you're playing Pyro?
no
i have a question
I am confused :/
Shizuka: you NEED to take pictures when you play!
11,01Maybe I'll stream this.
13detonator is now bubbles, degreaser hasn't changed
lol
has anypony heard of a mlp.fim game?
?
13looks like none of the flamethrowers changed, so must be new item only
we all have magic
Someone needs to mod TF2 so whenever you play Pyro, you see in Pyrovision
if only
13that's what the goggles are for
YO GUYS
SolairePony89: also a heavy skin mod for every thing
HAPPY CAPS DAY
It's gonna happen within the next month or so
13i feel bad that i used the nametag and description shamrocs gave me on derpy eyes... now i am conflicted which to use
Well well well. Now I'm updating

And for me it's gonna almost take 2 bucking hours :|
and a shoutout

What an excellent driver
indeed
13something has changed the HUD, probably the new weapons that have charge meters
Well I'll let that update :P
BULLHORN FACE!
It reminded me of that one skit in Robot Chicken where Anakin Skywalker was killing younglings but was imagining himself frolicking in a sunflower field whilst doing that.
13anyway changing to doomsday, server will be open momentarily

Didn't get a picture of it xD to large to see.
Alister: Im surprised. I never see you in the main room
burn baby burn
sagas[A]: Well , I wanted to chill in the mainroom tonight
maybe its because of how bad reality is
Om: :( u found any brony around? =D

LightNight: everything has its brighter side
LightnNight: allow me: http://derpy.me/R0yX1

Dken2021: What ?

Alchemist: lol that guy reminds me of snape

APS|Assassin: DAMN nature! u scary!
:Oalso nobody can juge pinky pie
ya pretty much I don't have much of a connection with my family they all seem to ignore me and only until now after i finished high school do they actually give me recognition
MahBoi777: australia for u
and i feel the same way
lol when the us presidential elections were on http://assets.meanwhilein.org/hashed_silo_content/70d/f7b/049/resized/meanwhile-in-australia-ddea5e.jpg
it is impossible to get away with being ones self anymore
APS|Assassin That is why im arachniphobic
MuffinsPrime: lol
for those who are depressed, there isnt much to say. I know that things like "look at the bright side" and such are meaningless at that point. All I can say is hold the f*ck on.
i would never tell anybody that i like mlp since i know ppl would just laugh
LightNight you could always try hanging out with your family
not rlly ha...

MahBoi777: i think I did, but at the end i hit my head very HARD!
I'm confused. What am I watchin'? :P
/me hugs CCCP
curse you gravity!
I hear sparkles and rainbows....is this a mod or is this Pyro's world?
LightNight: just stay strong
more goofyness
/me hugggggglesssszz Dken2021
AttackWithHugs: I think it's just Pyro's world
wut?
looks like someone modded the pyro's flamethrower
i am not suicidal or anything but i wish this life would either change or end
LOL
MahBoi777: It looks VERY colorful for Doomsday. I imagined it to be...dark...and industrial-ish
flutter_spin you've never heard of Team Fortress 2?
I've heard of it. I'm trying to figure out the mods
AttackWithHugs: all thanks to Pyrovision XD
LightNight: do you try to change it?
MahBoi777: Good ol' Pyrovision
So far I know "party cannon"
I can't tell the rest
indeed, Pyrovicion is best vision
This is all for the new Meet the Pyro that came out
i cant see the fun in this world perspective
So I'm guessing it's a CP map?
Rarity?
CP?
WHAT?
i guess im blind
Control Point
these brownouts bug me
brb
/me hugs LightNight
:)
Who's streaming?
LightNight: Im sure you have your own idea what is fun. Do what YOU think is fun.
I think Nittany_Discord
nittany
yea
Ok :3
Fun isnt an objective absolute thing.
true friendship but it doesnt exist only in mlp
Rainbow Dash = Nit
i wouldn't mind doing anything if i had the right people to work with
flutter_spin: Ok. Got it.
Ponies > Life
^
what's weird?
weird waat?
How about trying to make friends with people you can assume you think alike? From this community for example?
awt I think i may be a doctor!!!!!!!!!??
LightNight: same
am i the only one who thinks that the lyra plushie is a cider cup holder
flutterchu: you are wrong. Its a horn warmer.
flutterchu I like to keep that mindset
It's an arrow quiver
i don't think I could find fun in anything the only thing i do often is play video games and that is just to make the time pass
i wouldnt even define it as fun
i think the noticed that one of the ponies on the eq banner has a cutie mark of yoshi
mabye i dont want to think about it anymore
meet the pyro worst one yet
i mean worst one
flutterchu: liked it aloooooot
flutterchu: :O
LightNight it's up to you in the end, if you want some happiness, nothing wrong with that, but it all depends how much you want change
0,14Meet The Pyro was great
awwwww, what happened?
SaxyPretender: i agree
Meet the Pyro was probably my favorite
CCCP: to ambarrasing for me
i dont get it
My class thought Meet the Pyro was funy.
SaxyPretender: definitely
flutterchu: :P
flutterchu strange way of spelling "BEST EVER"
Dken2021: wat do you mean
CCCP: like whatever
SaxyPretender: indeed it was
LightNight: I was like that for a long time. Then I got "lucky". I found something I like with passion and pursue that. It seems thats what you need. Something you are passionate about.
it says its offline :(
/me hugs flutterchu
LightNight you make your own fun, don't try to be dependant on others
i cant have fun alone
CCCP: pleeeeeeeeeeease dont hug me :(
The pure insanity in Meet the Pyro was just great
odd. I can't fun alone either.
my fun is others fun i guess you could say
flutterchu: :( aww why?
blue team = rainbow dash
sagas: I want that ballonicorn but I don't have money for it
ballonicorn?
CCCP: dont do anything for no reason because youll waste the amount of his life ill be right back now baaaaaaiiiiiiiiiii

AttackWithHugs: tis a crying shame

LightNight: dont worry, i'd be saying the same thing too

LightNight I understand how you feel, just saying no need to self pity yourself
AttackWithHugs: why of course!
Hello Everyone.
LightNight: Im 27. I started college 2 years ago, because I had no idea what to do with my life. Sometimes it takes some time.

LightNight college helps with that, though that depends if you have something else planned
LightNight: you and me and similar lifes, but i do have a therapist and it helps me a little, try that
Naw, its just that I never 'got' TF2. I never found it fun :(
LightNight: It couldnt hurt.

AttackWithHugs: *sigh* here we go again...
You crazy Mr. Sith

im just screwing myself over and i can see that
Alister: im sitting here eating the the flesh of an animal

03Simpsons and all those did years ago
dont got a job or money or car

wb SolairePony89!
Alister: Oh they dont. Social darwinism is a very conservative idea. Like an everybody for themselves approach
hi SolairePony89
chat derp ?
nvm
superretroworld: thats what ponies are for
'Ello CCCP
hey, its good ol' CCCP
i swear i always know the answers to things, I always know why things happen certain ways and know how to solve my issues or challenges, I can learn anything concrete but abstract things like (fun, love, selflessness) all seem fake and not understandable or relatable
SaxyPretender: oi you should be glad i noticed that
Ingwaz: true, but i have to admit, sometimes im jealous of there friendship
sagas: I consider myself more of a Libertarian than a Darwinist
0,14XD
03LOL "Every plane. Every plane, there has to be a crying baby and a mother ignoring it"
True story Peter?
hi Ingwaz
03dunno, I usually watch movies and stuff on planes
wut?
03so I never hear them anyway
definitly jealous I have some friends but I am fake and hide my true self to be accepted
*just watched meet the pyro*
Everything... sort of makes sense now in the game
Alister: Ah so youre Libertarian. That is a rather socially darwinistic. You dont want people to recieve aid or help
LightNight: the problems of an analytical mind
flutter_spin and now you know
sagas: I do like heloing others , but I don't want to force people to help others if they don't want too. Freedom is my ultimate desire
how do i fix it
sagas: Helping*
it was funny for about 5 seconds, until the guys starting screaming in terror
superretroworld: well, equestria is a very ideal place, so in many cases, the things in there are ideals as well
Then it wasn't funny anymore
LightNight like I said, no need fro self pity, it would make things worse
Alister: Im talking as in having people recieve aid from the federal govt and other social services
sagas: That is specifically what I dislike
We like cancelled the movie channels here to save money on our cable bill
its not rlly pity i just know my flaws and am trying to find how to fix them
i kno that i am negative
since we're using Amazon stream and other sites
xD
03heh
03we get movie channels for free
:|
ok, someone has to sing the Super Speedy Cider 6000 song
03well
03Starz and Encore
Alister: Okay I think I get more about where youre tendencies lie
:v
Well
Ahh... I walked for 45 minutes.
03they have HBO/Starz/Skinemax which are like $15 a month each
03but yeah
03all 3 of those get recorded a lot and put up on hdbits :P
/me believes in magic, in a young brony's heart
flutter_spin: well lookie what we got here brother of mine, its the same in every town
flutter_spin bonus point for being intoxicated while singing it
^^
hmm
ingwaz: yeah this and equestria is sort of my escape world
actually brb, gonna switch to windows
sagas: I know many most people would disagree with me , But I'd never lie about my opinions to get ''friendly'' with everyone
03LOL Peter just stabbed Cleveland in the stomach
that was kind of good
superretroworld: an ideal world would indeed be nice...sadly our world is far from ideal
03oh yeah, this was also after the invention of The Cleveland Show (which sucks btw)
man, it's been like a month since I watch a pony episode
Alister: I dont expect you to lie and I wouldnt want you too :)
superretroworld: i agree equestria seems like my utopia and i use abstratc and virtual means to escape wat is reality since I cannot find happyness and something that I can find fun
sagas: Thank you for understanding
Alister: i do not consider it lying. I may withhold my opinions in certain situations in order to not offend or start an argument
Alister: Any time :)
Dken2021: eh. I write on my mlp story everyday
the system is du
ingwaz: But if I'm asked , I will say what I think to my fullest
ingwaz: ik, too bad it isnt real
Alister: well, if someone outright asks your opinion on something, then yeah, they asked
LightNight: same
Why do I suddenly have an urge to join them
one day pinkie will destroy it http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0abdb1e40747ab08a72a571b71e7fe38/119693%20-%204th_wall%20brony%20fluttershy%20hug%20hugs%20macro%20mane_6%20meme%20pinkie_pie%20pony%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20twilight_sparkle.jpg
superretroworld: it sucks, but getting stuck on the want of an ideal world sucks too. will make you very negative and pesamistic
superretroworld: O_O
What's that
nEver heard of it :s
sorry for the long link
lol
zo BRD
shut up :P
i bourght your SOR BD
i enjoyed it
seems like hope
i'm gonna unwrap it and copy it to my HD first, k?
bluer?
superretroworld: #1 wheres aj? #2 the english major in me screams at the word choice of could instead of can
03sure
ingwaz: ikr?
There is no point in saying this world is doomed , try to make good everyday you can , if you have the opportunity m take it.
totally
LightNight: fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free
/me "All I learned from love is how to shoot at smeone who out drew you"

What movie is SOR?
wat
:s
I don't get it
Alister: Song sad lyrics Im listening to
ingwaz: i don't think for me and myabe superretroworld that we r really searching for the ideal world I think it is more we realize how unideal our world is after influence from shows like mlp
swimming over rainbows
Is it anime?
Or some adult fli-
0,14mfw Meanwhile's starting
/me hide
STOP STARTIN SAXY
its a movie about some dudes on drugs
/me hides
I'LL FUCKING EAT YOU.
Man this would have been a good day to play TF2... -__-
LightNight: and bronies want to be in that ideal world
Not surprised
:P
nah, jj
0,14@_@
oh
School of Rock actually
Should have guessed
Well , of course the world won't be good for you if only complain , you have the possiblity to make good around you.
Is it 5.1 supahsurround chnl edit
:p
SaxyPretender: he so startin
oh and Ninjazz, it might not be what you wanted, but you are now "Day Star" brother of "Night Star" , protector of Cloudsdale
0,14Shamroc, call him a slag
SaxyPretender you're a slag.
Alister like this guy I had in high school said: be the change you want to be in the world
the movie was always in 5.1
flutter_spin: Sounds good! In the end, all I really wanted was a role. ^^
0,14nono, Meanwhile, it is you who is the slag. because you're starting
hehe
most movies from 1990+? are
being the inspiration for the idea, eh?
Dken2021: Thank you , this expresses what I'm trying to say perfectly
Rly?
:o
i couldnt care less if it were ponies, kittens, puppies but wat remains the same is the reason i enjoy these things is that they seem to contain a aspect of something i enjoy
well ideal world or no ideal world, we want to thank Lauren Faust for making out lives, just a little brighter
I haven't ever noticed o-o
^
you didn't care because you only had 2 speakers
amirite?
And yes, I found a way to get Mr. Sith a minor role in the 3rd fanfic too
or I didn't see it in the menus
but yah
i didn't care about surround sound either, until i fixed by soundcard a year ago
I don't know. If it wasn't ponies, I would have definitely found something else to preoccupy me
SaxyPretender: yer a slag.
Using money on items seems... pointless?
nobody here can say that they act exactly how they truely are
0,14Meanwhile: stop starting.
Did you upgrade a driver?
everyone is a slave to the constructs of society
SaxyPretender: start stoppin
there is no way out
no way to make it better
nah, i just bunped some plugs
/me "I've seen your flag on the marble arch, love is not a victory march, it's a cold and its a broken Hallelujah" :'(
ppl find artificial happyness in work that seems ur choice
0,14Slagwhile, better start starting to stop so he can stop his starting
All in all a good use of time to me, flutter_spin. :3
but in the end u have to -choose- something
Also, apparently turning on VLC spatiliser/whatever + adjustments fixes the low speech issues I was having
this creates anxiety for ppl like me
who don't know wat to choose
i am confused
heh. My mother always told me that I was slow in talking/reading, but good in creative processes like drawing/writing/sculpture
and cant see how anything that i have to choose is going to be fun
lolwut
Dat No.
dem no's
lol
Well, some songs
I dunno :p
i thought it was a bug in VLC that the center channel is too loud whenyou have a quad configuration?
I just felt like doing writing right now :P
i feel like i am spamming chat with my depressed thoughts and that the words i speak r doing no good to anybody
i think it's the song fault
yeah
not everyone have a dream job. actually only the very lucky ones get paid to do what they like. The rest of us choose something we are okay with and use the money to fuel our acutal passion.
Actually, LightNight , I've been trying to piece your chat together.
LightNight: just think of the positives
also, newer movies, the surround sound is more likely to be used/mixed better
wat is postivie?
besides the not negative end of a battery
stupid reference
LightNight anything that's the opposite?
but in all honesty
lolwut, the sor BD35 is transparent
LightNight you're living and healthy, that's positive
moop
i feel like i am trapped
It is an odd trade-off, like in my case. Spend your time working super hard living by yourself or spend your time in college while living in your parent's home. Now if they are forcing you and you HAVE to pay... that might be a different story
The odd situation, where I am now, is when college doesn't help you improve your job chances
Weeirdd
In any chance, they look for your job experience and not college experience
Is it a bootleg then? :P
But if you are looking for something to do in college, that might be more of a personal choice
it is rlly easy to answer
well ttyl bye
seeya Magic
later Magic!
woot its re... wait, I better not ping people ingame again
i like being happy
there is nothing fun
nah, it also has redone? credits
besides friendship
i cant do anything
LightNight: and cookies
Then go and pursue that.
and have fun unless i have pl too work with
i wonder if they'll be another pony in the mane 6
looks sharp enough, but i think i see wierd artefacts around some outlines
is it interlaced?
in the mane 6... you mean fighting is magic?
That would be bad :s
but thats the problem i don't know how to pursue that
hm,
or like in season 3, another pony be introduced
Frame rate : 23.976 fps
Color space : YUV
Bit depth : 8 bits
Scan type : Progressive
doesn't say so
Simple: you go out and meet with lots of people.
i have a real problem with seeing the negative
exactly
in everything
i mean in the show
it is too clear to me
the opposite is not so clear
Maybe someone gives you reason to change your mind
I wouldn't mind an actual side story of like... Luna
Too easy to only see what's wrong with things
0,14^
flutter_spin: isnt there already a back story, in the very begining of the 1st ep
nono, like ep4.
gotta look at the positives, you'll feel much better
not a backstory, but a front... story? Like what Luna does on a normal typical day
There's always some good in everything.
MahBoi777: You are ugly but kind :)
What did she do during the wedding, for example
ohai everypony!
Om: oh stop :D
flutter_spin sleeping?
there is no postiive :(
hai Biglaw
flutter_spin: ya that'll be cool
Of course there is.
LightNight: i think you need to see a therapist
LightNight: Never say that. There is always a positive. You just need to find it.
LightNight: there IS positive. You just cant see it yet for some reason.
If you think about it, Luna is perhaps the only pony that is awake during the night. What does she do to preoccupy herself?
I'd love to see a "day in the life" episode comparing Luna to Celestia...heck, maybe even throw Cadence into it. I'd really like to see more about her.
Who cares ?
Unlike the Gamer Luna series where she just plays games all night, I bet she has some awesome responsibilities
flutter_spin: I always imagine she flies around and protects Equestria from the terrors of the night
LightNight I can tell you, I was like you once. but I realized I was too moody and a downer at times, and people don't like that
yeah. Totally be nice to have an episode like that DocSane
flutter_spin: unlike someone coughcoughcelestiacoughcough
Meet The Pyro was funny
Indeed. :D
celestia is useless!
and because of ur personality not being excepted you changed urself to something that you are not
best one by far XD
I am SUPER curious of other lands too. Where was that image of things to look for. Let me find it....
i don't want to sound negative and rude
but like i said
boooo?
i see negative and artificial
LightNight well, even I didn't like myself like that
LightNight: Question - Are you a kid or an adult?
teen
i just graduated
great, my Internet is kicking out again
and don;t know wat to do with myself
LightNight: Then I daresay what you're feeling is normal.
was the vocal levels on FRY_ME_TO_DA_MUUN too low?
^
^^
believe me... I was feeling JUST like you a few weeks ago.
LightNight: Graduated what? High school?
ya
Goooooo Sumica!
what is that talking? the pyro?
http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/05/24/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-season-predictions/ found it
oh
LightNight: And you see the world full of liars and phoniness everywhere?
LightNight: well theres nothng to worry about, youre starting a new life
This web client is interesting
not liars and phoniness just ppl how r misinformed and unwary of their situation
I've stopped pinging people playing after I found out that its... not good
well nobody's perfect
LCtest you been snooping us all this time?
0,14don't worry Sumica, I got this
Hey Everypony!
No I just joined >.>
LightNight: You're going to learn sooner or later that the only person you can really control is yourself.
hai Reikim
Hey... wait, weren't you playing Rei...
flutter_spin: why?
0,14oh hai Reikim
'tis weird to hear the game in both here and in game
Hey Reikim
It's like an echo
pinging people I guess alt tabs them out of the game
that is not entirely true
How is everyone?
Hm
oh, well lali-ho LordCelestia
hey Reikim!
chat derped
lali-ho?
ohai LordCelestia
Reikim: good
LightNight: And you can't let the fact that there are lots of stupid people in the world get you down.
LordCelestia dwarven greeting
and a bit on ZANK_NU_TENTSHE_NU_TWEEZII
with support anything is possible and society directs and drives ppl certain ways without them realizing
yaya

Hello everypony

or I just have my volume too low
Mr. Sith is funny
Either way :>
:D
0,14oh hai mishia
the greatandpowerful trixe died D:
one thing u say here might forever change and affect how someone else goes about their lives
LightNight: Unless you rolled a crazy charisma level in life, it's practically true.
LOL
Hey there, mishia.
oh hey ninjazz
long time no see
^_^
oh crap! I need to see Zero Punctuation's new video
Good to see you. *hugs mishia*
oh noooo by everypony D:
hey mishia!
pyro is best pony
Pinkie Pie is Best Pony
^
Yokan has fine volume
Pinkie Pyro is best pony
that's a weird spelling of spiderman
Twilight is the best, but Pinkie is a close second.
flutter_spin: i actually never liked discord, body swap would be random, mane 6 flashback and cmc older would be awsome, new town eh, EVEN MORE LUNA, BUT NO SEA PONIES
i just feel that i am alone in my thoughts and I feel like others ignore or disregard wat i am saying thinking I'm trying to grab attention
Rarity is too mainstream
Rarity. All I'm going to say before the war begins once again.
Too Manestream
the more i say the more guilty i feel
APS|Assassin: LOL ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?! :D
nah, it's their fault & i thought that too.
LOL
Rarity? mainstream? those word I have not heard together
Ninjazz: NOPE
that i could be exposing others to something thye would come to realize as true
oh
Ninjazz: caps
but urgh
*words
Like
LightNight: And what is it that you say that they disregard?
She's one of the least liked and you actually say she's too mainstream?
My new logitech Z4 speakers
it's quite a simple fix when i get round to doing them
Woo! Bronysith!
are like super quiet
compared to these old dell ones
UHHH. Ever heard of a little pony called Rainbow Dash?
Ninjazz: every brony i ask they say rarity
which have like 0 volume control
FALCON!
well when you see someone kill themselves for example u tend to look away or not want to think about it
and are almost at max blast on the lowest setting
:s
PAWWQWWEFEW
I like Rainbow Dash the best
oh
but not many try to take it in as wat it is
You probably have been talking to smart bronies then.
Ninjazz: actaully applejack was voted the least favourite pony from the 2012 awards
LightNight: think about your friends or someone that cares about you. there has to be someone
Well, next to Vinyl
So yeah, been failing as pyro
I have this like at
But the goggles are AMAZING
everyone loves dash, cause she's fan favorite
superretroworld: I said ONE of the least.
13 % in WinVolume
0,14pyro goggles can be equipped on any class, Reikim
Dken2021: Actually I find she's quite polarizing
and it is as loud as 40ish on my regular setting on my main speaks
SaxyPretender: I know, I just feel like playing pyro. I had a fun time as Demo earlier.
they have all chosen their own pathes and ways to go and i don't feel my presence has any relative meaning to it
nya
0,14ah
n.it
i dont want to intrude on anybody
LightNight: Why does your affecting their lives have to define your own happiness?
i feel like i am just a bother and stain to society
LightNight: you are not a bother to anyone, don't tell yourself that
LightNight: The fact that you exist means that the world feels a need for you.
arent i though?
i am spamming a chat of ppl who r here to have a good time
LightNight: fucking mean ppl are big bothers in society
with my problems and issues
0,14and LightNight, people are listening to them
LightNight: you are not alone
ya i am intruding
0,14meaning they want to talk to you about it
LightNight: And we're responding because, contrary to what you've been saying, a bunch of anonymous strangers DO care.
but wouldnt u have rather not gotten dragged in
I don't mind, I know how u feel
Indeed. Don't shut us out when you actually want to be heard.
What is this server and how would I get there?
0,14Let me say something I've always said about this place
try to value yourself more and dont put the happiness of people (who would ridicule you for some reason) in front of yours.
LightNight: i dont really see how thats an intrusion? as someone whos a bit on the analytical side, i understand where you're coming from, and while i think that way too sometimes, contrary to what i think seems logical, depending on the situation, its really not an intrusion
0,14No one is EVER alone here.

Chocolate Raaain
we may not all hold to this idea very strongly, but some of us do. bronies are family

What you say is being met with genuine concern from people here.

Biglaw: i breathe into mic to type

Let me just share a traditional video with you, LightNight.
i want to try to find
my own happyness
but i only see others
Welcome Welcome Welcome, LightNight. Enjoy your stay. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E
Pyros, Pyros everywhere
:D
:)
^_^
xD
i enjoyed that video
so LightNight i feel i should ask, whos your favorite pony?
awww
nosebleed :(
LightNight: Everyone here has a different story. I don't think anyone thinks they have a line on pure happiness.
Apple Jack and Fluttershy
I'm glad you did.
anybody find pinkies voice different in the welcome song?
DocSane very true
superretroworld: not really
nosebleeds, they confuse me
it's a japanese custon
Dken2021: custom is not really accurate
weird
lol
My most confusing nosebleed was whenever I moved, and the second I got out of the truck, my nose bled
sit
0,14that would be Shannon Chan-Kent
hi
I thought she was Rarity's singing voice
oh
SaxyPretender: long story short, it sounded like pinkie to me
0,14I believe both are credited with singing the Smile song
I can't. I can't play Lollipop Chainsaw without thinking of Twilight Sparkle
0,14also, Rarity's singing voice is provided by Kazumi Evans
Dken2021: Nose bleeds are kind of obvious: increased blood pressure = nose bleed.
KILL EVERYTHING WITH FIRE
maybe Pinkie is my favourite
YES
XD
LightNight: honesty and kindness, things you feel you have trouble showing?
she seems like the opposite of anything i have seen before
i can be kind
I <3 Pinkie
i like to see others happy
0,14...also, sidenote: Kazumi Evans is pretty >.>
i didnt mean you were unkind
The one bad thing about pyro is the short range of his/her weapons
then how can gabe have pictures of ponies in tf2?
SaxyPretender: Just like Rarity. :3
l
rather that you have trouble showing it in social situations, you find it awkward
LightNight: You should note that Pinkie NEEDS to make others happy because she's terrified of ever feeling sad.
0,14indeed, Ninjazz
maybe i can realte to that
^_^
superretroworld those are tags users put there
Dken2021: oh
DocSane: not true, shes not terrified of not feeling happy, she just loves being happy and making others happy
^^ LightNight , you should read my fanfics :P
ingwaz: I disagree, based on what we saw in Cutie Mark Chronicles.
didn't know you wrote fics flutter_spin
link plz
you'd be surprised. I've been still reworking the first fanfic.
so does anyone do art???
Otherwise, I would have advertised it
ouxh
ingwaz: She spent her early life feeling sad and lonely, saw something beautiful that made her happy for the first time, and has spent the rest of her life trying to never let that feeling fade.
DocSane: at what point in cutie mark chronicles was she scared? she was worried that her family would reject her new found happiness, this is true, but not scared because she wouldnt be happy, she was already happy, she just wanted to share that happiness
http://www.fimfiction.net/user/flutterspin
wow. the brony vs antibrony flame war is still raging in the pyro video throough 50000 comments :D
=__(\
really Alchemist ?
0,14mfw
Alchemist I would imagine it's total chaos
maybe i am pinkie in past tense
The pyro has G3 vision...
its scary :D
ingwaz: No, the scared part is from the episode where she had her nervous breakdown.
that's not chocolate milk :p
flutter_spin: whos tavi?
DocSane Party of one?
i can see rlly relate to her feeling trapped and surronded by depression
Yes
at this point I think trolls are trolling trolls :D
but remember wat cured her
superretroworld: Tavi is short for Octavia
Tavi?
an anomaly
something unrealistic
DocSane: she had a nervous breakdown because she is pinkie pie and let her worries get the better of her that her friends didnt like her anymore, not that she was not happy
!rorara
unexplanable
oh
Never use 'tavi' .. Octavia gives her respect
curse you kickbot
Buildin' Buildin' Buildin'
i got kicked might have missed something
LightNight: you posted too much in a short amount of time
6 times in 10 seconds i think?
too much to say
LightNight: it was an automated kick, it happens to all of us sometimes
ingwaz: im confused, was that becasue they didnt like her parties or was it actually her birthday?
often quiet people have the loudest minds :)
ingwaz: But you see, the fact that the mere idea that her friends didn't really like her triggering her breakdown shows that she's terrified of other people not liking her.
society limits the creativity and abstract feelings
lol
superretroworld: huh? is that a joke?
HeroBrony!
/me whispers I love you!
flutter_spin: flare would be jealous :D
was it her birthday when she got her cutiemark?
flare?
ingwaz: im guessing it was her birthday
nighty night
FlareChaser
ingwaz: And that was elaborated on with her deperately trying to get Cranky to like her.
nighty FlareChaser
lol
nighty night CCCP! *glomps*
jealous of what?
gnight FlareChaser! take care:)
no wait...
what?!
NO!
I
maybe the only way for me to be happy is to be like pinkie and just go out of my way to be myself and outgoing
flutter_spin: being with vinyl scrath in the link you posted
/me walts over to Biglaw and hugs
DocSane: it was not the mere idea that caused an immediate breakdown, it was a serious of very suspicious looking events that made it look like all her friends had been lying to her, secretly hated her, and wanted nothing to do with her anymore
...
ingwaz: I mean, she sang a song with the line "THere's one thing that makes me happy and makes my whole life worth while/And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile"
/me wubs hugs
/me stabs CCCP
no.
:O
DocSane: that would be enough to depress anyone, and when your mind moves as fast as pinkie, thats a dangerous thing
and now they're quoting tfs
FlareChaser: C:
but she looks happy
<3 goodnighty nighty
ingwaz: From everything we've seen of Pinkie on the show, she's an extremely insecure girl.
she looks unembarassed
I'm confused. The link I posted was to my fanfic user page. Nowhere do I mention Vinyl or Octavia
nighty night CCCP
Those are beer goggles
truley honest
/me hugs Dken2021
see ya
/me hugs CCCP back :D
dken
I ain't going LightNight
Unless you are stating that Moonlight IS me... which is more or less true
ergerger
oh
ccp
oops
i am confused
flutter_spin: didnt you post a link of wreks art?
ingwaz: She's happy as long as her role of clown and partymaker are intact.
/me pats LightNight on the back "it's no worry"
LightNight: no problem
yes, but I fail to see where I am in the picture
ingwaz: She gets dangerously depressed if those roles are ever questioned.
I fill her up, Balloons!
Baaaloooooons
DocSane: i would not say extremely insecure, if she were extremely insecure, she would have suspected the other ponies excuses for why they couldnt come to her party outright and called them liars even if they had legitimate excuses. it is not that she is insecure, its that she had something she thought absolutely impossible shoved in her face due to unfortunate misperceived circumstances which caused her some serious depression
DocSane: when kranky rejected her many times, she did not get depressed, she was simply determined
flutter_spin: there was a picture of vinyl scracth and octavia remember?
Wrek is not me. Wrek is Wrek. He draws on the stream all the time.
wow
ingwaz: But her determination shows that it's not that she wants to be friends with everyone. She NEEDS to be friends with everyone.
.
DocSane: not true, she was willing to accept that cranky would not be her friend
ingwaz: Because if one person rejects her, it means that everyone else potentially can, as well./
!hyper
maybe im insecure
Pony Fortress 2
!glacmyr
LightNight: we're all insecure about something
npopp33
LightNight: anyone who is not is a fool who is not aware of their own faults
no
evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?
eh nevermind. Conversations got crossed.
hai Sylandest
Sylandest!
M_BISON_YES.avi
super pony bros, legend of ponies, call of ponies, pony-man,
/me glomps Sylandest
ingwaz: Except she wasn't actually accepting it. She was runnign around badgering him to forgive her.
And my mom is annoying me right now
/me hugs Dken2021 and MahBoi777 :)
eww, sherbert?
Herbert
Sylandest: Ello der
howdy, MahBoi777! :D
good afternoon everypony
XD
Om: howdy! How are you tonight?
0,14oh hai Sylandest and DeathStar
/me huggles Sylandest back
Soerbert
ingwaz: Hence Twi's faceplant when Pinie still wouldn't take the hint to leave him alone.
woot DeathStar
DocSane: forgive her for accidentally ruining an object of his, not become his friend
good afternoon DeathStar!:)
howdy, SaxyPretender! How are you?
it seems like this conversation is just me escaping again I haven't found any concrete answers
0,14I am OKAY
hey DeathStar
howdy, DeathStar!
Sher-Burgaler
TF2 awwww yeeeaaahhhh! :D
Sylandest: Pretty good. Went to the beach drew A big Rainbow Dash in the sand
VICTORY!
lol. There is a lot flooding into my brain right now. Give me a moment to clear my thoughts.
Om: ooooh! well done!
i have blown an amount of time talking about the problems i have
（￣へ￣）
Y DU DIS!!
and wasted many ppls time
ingwaz: She was still trying to extract some kind of victory by trying to get him to say that he didn't hate her.
LightNight I didn't think it was
Om and not a single buck was given that day
LightNight: i cant tell you the answers because theyre your answers, not mine. but dont be so worried about it so much. not everyone needs to be mr. popular with 100 friends. you are who you ar
Biglaw: Not a one.
Chocodiles
DocSane: again, not true, she asked for forgiveness for destroying an item, cranky never once said he hated her, simply that he did not wish to be her friend
nobody has true friends
nobody is true
ingwaz: One thing that's very telling in that episode is during the song, when we see sad Pinkie being comforted by happy Pinkie.
0,14I doubt that, LightNight
well goodbye everypony i have to go to work now cyas
seeya RainBowJack
bye RainBowJack!
0,14my best friends? they'r elike my brothers
Cya, RainBowJack. Take care.
LightNight Nothing is true, everything is permitted
Some of my best friends are here, actually.
Biglaw: sacred, not true
ingwaz: Because they switch from showing Pinkie comforting all her friends to comforting herself.
ingwaz: And there's the crux of why Pinkie acts the way she does.
You're... Going to LOVE ME!:[
da wha?
but how true r u to them?
maybe its just me
but i don't act true
i cant
ingwaz: All that running around and making people happy is her constantly keeping herself from falling into gloom.
but cancer taste delicious with butter
DocSane: no not pinkie
DocSane: thats caused by all those sweets
Hee hee
ingwaz: It's all there in that musical number.
OK, gotta go to sleep ...........see you tomorrow
LightNight: haha, i bet you analyze situations when talking to people and try to pick the best possible choice of words or what to do in order to keep them happy, dont you?
DocSane: i disagree entirely
ingwaz: As I said, they literally show her pulling her sad self out of the gloom and making her happy.
Bye
seeya Dark92Enigma
bye Dark92Enigma, sleep well!
bye Dark92Enigma
DocSane: that does not mean that she is reliant on being happy 24/7 in order to not fallin to a doom an gloom
i do
0,14later Dark92Enigma
DocSane: if that were the case, she would literally need to be making others happy 24/7, which she does not
I saw a pinkie on that wall
lol SOR BD has japanese audio
ingwaz: She isn't?
>lip flap
bye Dark92Enigma
LightNight: so do i, its difficult though
ingwaz: Because that episode implies that she spends her days doing exactly that.
so pinkie feeds on the happiness on others, a crazy pony, or a changeling in disquise?
Cya, Dark92Enigma. Take care.
DocSane: that is her element, a predominant part of her personality. not the entirety of her personality
Mmm mmmmph
She doesn't so much feed on it as use it as a central support to her personality.
LightNight: people are quite hard to understand arent they? you analyze the situation, pick the logical choice, and yet soemtimes they do something so strange
night everypony
goodninght superretroworld
well im off to bed
They need to do an episode similar to Winter Wrap-Up, where they take away the defining thing to Pinie and then see how she deals with it.
night superretroworld!
goodninght sagas
Sugar Famine of Ponyville
0,14later sagas
Winter Wrap-Up was all about Twilight discovering what's left when you take away her magic.
:)
i just try to do wat ppl will except me by
i try to stay within the boundaries of society
i try to not do anything unordinary
ALL the boredom!
but i think this just shows how dumb i am
DocSane: twilights magic doesnt really compare with pinkie pie at all unless you take away her ability to party at all, which in that case...she would probably be able to sit still for a very short time, and then freak out from boredom
Biglaw, come and be bored with us!
So are you guys enjoying the stream?
Dken2021 don't have steam, and my netbook wouldn't be able to run TF2 efficiently
LightNight: stupidity is claimed by those who cannot admit their ignorance. a lack of understanding does not make one stupid
ingwaz: I mean do an episode where Pinkie can't rely on making others happy in order to make herself happy.
Just joined the stream
I'll have an exam in 2 hours :D
Are we debating again? I love debates! May I bring my shotgun?
0,14Biglaw, I KNOW YOUR PAIN
Alchemist my last exam was a week ago :D
Alchemist oh my
11,01Got angry. Ended up helping to win the game.
/me pats SaxyPretender's shoulfer
well im just confused
ingwaz: In other words, what happens when you cut off the most social character on the show from her social network?
Shoulder*
Nittany_Discord: Good job being a team player.
DocSane: that requires that you base her personality on the idea that she must continually make others happy in order to keep herself happy.
0,14mfw only 4 passes left for BronyCon
Pyros everywhere
I have read most of the stuff, but if they want me to talk about specifics Im screwed :D
ingwaz: I maintain that the text of the Pinkie episodes bears that out.
DocSane: complete removal very suddenly from any and all social contact would disturb anyone who had somewhat of a social circle
SaxyPretender I would go, but I have no money, and no way to get there
DocSane: and i reject that idea
0,14aww
Dat Taunt
SaxyPretender: Is anyone gonna be streaming Bronycon?
Dat Amazing taunt... o__o
Kittens!
0,14as in anyone here?
lLlll
flfl
SaxyPretender: Yeah
yes
SaxyPretender: what?
0,14no idea >.>
Ubercharged Pyro? 0_0
so many cute...
ingwaz: Okay, I'm citing specific segments to back up my claim. What is there in the actual text of the show that disputes it?
Your OS is frozen!
A picture of a kitten next to a pic of Fluttershy's plot. Nosureifgusta
Everything is Pyro-Fied
So
SaxyPretender: Awww. Someone here needs to stream Bronycon
DocSane: you're not citing a specific segment, you're using a specific segment by suggesting that it implies that condition. i have said many times before that if you look at it from another way, it suggests that it is not the case
Perhaps next year I'll try to go to BronyCon
they will be having a bronycon stream at everfree radio
No, I'm not implying. I cited direct quotes and specific segments.
I wont ever go to Bronycon. Its 10000km away.
Mmmhmmhmmhmmmhmmmm!
For me, BronyCon is about 850km
i would go to bronycon
what are you two arguing about anyway?
but i cant
Shamroc: Meanwhile is rigth behind you
ingwaz and
Cutie Mark Chronicles specifically stated that she uses parties to keep the feeling she had of seeing the rainboom from fading.
why are we arguing about something like this?
seems pointless
DocSane: not once has it been stated by pinkie pie or others that she must keep others happy in order to keep herself happy so that she does not fall in to a very deep depression and a bit of a psychotic fit
BAppleJuice: I claim that Pinkie Pie is extremely insecure and has a need to make others happy in order to keep herself happy.
BAppleJuice: there is no point, THERES NEVER A POINT
look at them being philosophical, citing quotes and shizz :D
o-o
what do you think i'm doing?
its impressive :)
I mean, that goes under "inconsequential" for me. I mean I think about the characters, but why argue
Don't go to film school, kids. This is where it lands you.
i still loves pinkie pie
using apple?
No
Using any OS
The bad GPU driver plague has spread
DocSane: in the cutie mark chronicles, pinkie sees the rainboom, says she never felt joy like that before and that she wanted to share it. knowing that rainbooms do not come along often, she decides to throw a party in an attempt to get her family to smile. no where in there does she has to do so to keep the feeling
No OS is safe :|
0,14Sumica, that was a burn :3
does she say she has*
also the debate seems to be missing the point entirely
of COURSE she wants to continue feeling good
and finding a passion is a good way for anyone to keep happy and joyful
duh
0,14dats adorable, Dken2021
however, I don't have a gfx card \o/
o-o
DocSane: had it been the case that she had to, when her family did not originally act favorably, she would have had a much harsher emotional reaction than simply being disappointed
how
is
that
Midnight_Tempest: zombie bullshit
YOU STILL HAVE DRIVERS
possible
!!!
ITS A CARTOON
Intel has crappy drivers too
;-;
what are you using, a serial terminal?
BAppleJuice: So?
Hi everypony, what the hell is going on in the stream? 6_9
i just don't have a gfx card.
hai Irish_Pony
debates over healthcare have been saner
FUU LINUX!!!
Irish_Pony: tf2 the greatest pc shooter ever
hiya Irish_Pony
i guess you have worse things to deal with
BAppleJuice: the disagreement that we are having is that pinkie feels she must keep others happy in order to keep herself happy so that she does not fall in to a deep depression and somewhat psychotic rage
BAppleJuice: So I wasn't the only one that had that thought?
i'm using the i3 intergrated gfx drivers
then how are you displaying text and graphics on a monitor?
Hiiyo Irish_Pony, have you seen Meet the Pyro yet?
Pete-Sauce
SolairePony89: Indeed :P
BAppleJuice: basically, if shes not making others happy, shes not happy, and if shes not happy, shes depressed to the extreme
so basically Pinkie is a ticking psycho time-bomb?
Alchemist: unless i'm mistaken, thats the stance DocSane is taking
ingwaz: that is not important to the show since it would never go that far. That's what fan fiction is for, to explore character traits
Irish_Pony: Just checkin'. Whoever's streaming is seeing in Pyrovision
did they really make the rainbow shooting gun
lol
I mean there's nothing objective about this argument
well, so is Twilight :D
BAppleJuice: in fan fiction thats fine, but if someone is imposing it on the actual show, that i disagree with
(Rewatches the scene in Cutie Mark Chronicles...)
The GPU is in the CPU package ;O
GNEIUS
Indeed, ingwaz.
well, ingwaz, sometimes you have to get over it. people will differ in opinions
well, some mnfs like to call it a "APU"
well if you'll all excuse me, theres some vintage googles that I must obtain :P
now kiss
Hey eveypony whats up yall
BAppleJuice: that i can accept, and the entire debate will have to end regardless as i've got to get to sleep. but debating is just something i do. i can agree to disagree just fine, but if someone tells me i'm wrong about something and i believe i'm not, i will defend my view
nothing like eating cereal at 12 at night
hai xxMoopyxx
hai
BAppleJuice: of course, if they can show me that i'm wrong, then i can accept that i'm wrong as well
hiya xxMoopyxx
hiya
sometimes my gfx does crash, but it usually brings itself up again after a few secs
issue is that it inhibits upgrades
but then again, you are on a Mac so you are used to having no upgrade options
dats 4 UDMA scoolz
well I suppose if you enjoy debating on that level, then there is no saving you. anyway, it's not a crime to argue about ponies - but it does seem inane
just my input
actually, i'm on a PC
True story
yay!
Hey ponies47 you here man
He's on a PC
:o
;O
Oh wait I forgot
Pinkie's lines after seeing the rainboom: "I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good that I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too! But rainbows don;t come along that often. I wondered how I else I could create some smiles."
0,14well, I'm off to bed
i been having a PC as a primay computer for 1.5+ years
0,14good night, everyone and enjoy the stream
i cound install a dedicated gfx card
Making music is soo much more sensible than on a Mac :<
SaxyPretender: night man
Eeeeeeh!
I haz one
well, depenz
goodninght SaxyPretender
nighty night saxy
you saxy beast
Good night Saxy
But I bet your integrated GPU is betah
Good night SaxyPretender! Stay... Saxy?
it's eh, but if i don't game, i'm fine
is that the new pyro taunt thing?
main reason you'd want a mac for music is logic/garageband and possibly a solid audio/MIDI framework
DocSane: but her reaction to her family's initial perceived rejection is not an extreme. if her emotions were that fragile and insecure, they would have been
well
Ahem
Get a nice powerful PC
Run Virtualbox + OSX
and profit
;l
I can run it right now :s
GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR SPIRIT
DocSane: also, if anything, the events leading up to party of one, since we do not know of any time where shes had trouble being happy would seem to make her less insecure rather than more
GOOD NIGHT Bronysith!
thanks
it's not quite the same. OSX is quite laggy/buggy on PC VM, iirc
/me writes a fanfic where Pinkie Pie cheers up foals at an orphanage set during the great parasprite famine.
gnight Bronysith!
may the 4th be wit hyou as well Bronysith
Yeah
ingwaz, did you see PARTY.MOV?
BAppleJuice: inane it can be, but this is how i kind of feel when it goes with a debate http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/duty_calls.png
It's almost stable for me
besides, thereare plenty of fine PC or cross-platform music programs
:>
BAppleJuice: yes, some of it was funny, but overall kind of meh
The funny thing is
but if you want to do surround sound, PC might be easier 'cuz many modern PCS have analogue surround out.
ingwaz: funny link :)
the audio kext is b0rked
esp. if you build your own
Crashes dat VM
badly
ingwaz: I think the events leading up to her breakdown in Party of One show that she has a pretty strong ability to deny the obvious when she doesn;t want to face an unpleasant truth.
for mac or laptops you might need to external sound card
ingwaz: didja find the secret message? allso I kinda agree. It is seeming more and more like family guy or something
BAppleJuice: wasnt really looking for a secret message, so perhaps i missed it
Yay its sumica
ingwaz: Notice that she basically forces Spike to tell her the thing she didn't want to hear because she wouldn't admit it to herself.
Well hey
You can have over 9000 (tm) audio ports on a PC
DocSane: if she were as insecure and as unstable as you suggest, the slightest thing would offset her extremely and send her in to a downward spiral
PCi/PCI-E sound cards ftw
ingwaz: it was on Pinkie Pie's booze. It was apple code: ***** ***** ****** ****
limited by the amount of expansion ports you have
Sadly
But one day.
want me to reveal the message? :)
I need to go to bed everypony, see you all later!
BAppleJuice: sure...i'm not going to bother to check it
ok
APPLE BLOOM NEVER DIED
seeya Biglaw
Good night Everypony!
night Biglaw
night BIGLAW
gnight Biglaw
OneTrickPony's got one song
later bigjaw!
LAW
Bigjaw????
Da Buck?
:)
ingwaz: My personal head canon at this point is that Pinkie laughs at the things that scare her, and she laughs all the time because, deep down, she's ALWAYS scared.
opps i mispeld it
...?
DocSane: if her defenses were that extreme, she would not have minded their excuses at all, yet she quickly turned to suspicion after RD and FS talked to her
Nothing ;-;
DocSane: head canon i can accept, actual canon i will debate about until the cows come home
oh?
Hey whats veemi.com?
It's just
DocSane: dat theory
we need more PCI ports
:<
ingwaz: But her suspicion only arose after EVERYONE begged off on her party.
/me f2k 00800.m2ts_3 (6chFLAC@3506kbps, 2739.79mb/109:16)
xxMoopyxx the site which this stream is being broadcasted on
oh ok
auido from SOR, sometimes ambience, sometimes discrete material in the back speakers
DocSane: but she accepted rd and fs' excuse as legitimate and then suspected ts, aj and ra, who had more believable excuses
ingwaz: She managed to keep fooling herself right up to the point that RD and FS became the last two friends who rejected her.
DocSane: that seems backwards
2GB
:o
ntrly
3GB
:o
Big file
ingwaz: Well, see, that's the Rule of Funny kicking in.
6 channels, 24bit FLAC (from DTSHD)
Can that be mixed down to 4chan easier/
1h49mins
DocSane: if you're talking about something logically, you cant throw in the rule of funny to disregard something
lolol4chan
just shove it though VLC in 2F2R mode
ingwaz: That's the joke. She believes the obvious lie and suspects the more reasonable excuses.
they talk funny
ingwaz: But that's how her character works.
Amazing that programs do the work for you
or if you want to make a separate file that IS 4ch, should be easy enough
DocSane: i understand its a joke, but if you're not taking her literally at all times, you cannot take what she says literally other times and be 100% certain about it
ingwaz: She can be almost perfectly illogical at times.
(without downmixing on playback)
hehe
listening to flutter F
DocSane: her extreme depression in party of one can easily be disregarded by the rule of funny in that case
ingwaz: Except the whole episode built up to it. It wasn't a throwaway gag.
ingwaz: That whole episode turns on the breakdown and her reaction to the idea that her friends don;t like her anymore.
It's raining
heavily
2am rain
I like rain
ingwaz: And it's consistent, from the set-up to the denouement in the barn at her birthday party.
damn. microsleeps are kicking in
need coffee
doesn't rain maek sleeping harder?
Heh its like a baby land
brb
I leik teh rain
DocSane: again, if the best friends you had suddenly ditched you, hated you, and wanted you gone, that would be enough to depress anyone. pinkie moves at a mile a minute, coupling that with depression is a recipe for disaster
(I need to turn this into a panel for this year's Anime Weekend Atlanta)
I am glad its not raining
inb4 reception would be wuss
Wow. Are we still arguing here?
ingwaz: But no one ever said that they hated her. That was her telling herself that.
yea
yet when she believed her parents had rejected her party in the cutie mark chronicles, she did not have an extreme reaction. i see the points you're making, but there are other points that disagree with it
11,01Team Failtress :<
ingwaz: a) that was a story told from Pinkie's point of view, b) she didn't have the chance to.
cellular phones use the UHF high band or even EHF low band
those bands do not penetrate walls very well
DocSane: the events told her that they did, they indeed did not say outright to her face, we hate you, she saw them on several occasions saying that they didnt want her to find out, their thing would be much better than her party, i know fluttershy said something as well but it escapes me atm
oh wow the offline thing again
This is still going on?!
Reikim: she became depressed in an instant in party of one, at first she was sad, but she quickly changed
Long debate is loooooooong
fear not SolairePony89, i need to sleep, have to be back up in 6 hours for work
11,01That's it for me.
well i guess i have to back out and re come back in i guess
just when I want to go to bed... PONY STORIES ...
I recorded some of the derp rockets from yesterday http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yng0E3pCPGM&feature=g-upl :3
Thanks for the stream, Nittany_Discord. :)
00,10embed is on mips refresh if you want to see what's on it
thanks for streaming Nittany_Discord!
ingwaz: The parts where they don't perfectly agree can be explained by the three main Pinkie episode having been written by three different writers.
the typical bands for CDMA and GSM phones are 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz
mmmmmmm
D'aaaawwwwwwww
coffeeee
00,10So I said I would re air it tonight and here it is
ingwaz: But all three have common elements of Pinkie feeling a need to spread laughter, being upset when it's rejected, and being driven to extremes of behavior to correct it.
Woo~ Thanks, Sumi!
YAY
OHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSHOHMYGOSH
yea!!!!
pinkie pie wat is the way out
F*** YEA!
DocSane: whats teh 3rd one you're thinking of? obviously cutie mark chronicles and a friend in deed
00,10Time for some Iroh man
korra!
Gah! I've missed the last 3 episodes before this, I feel like I shouldn't be watching this x_x
lol nope
Me too, OtakuTom. T__T
Cutie Mark Chronicles, Party of One, and Friend In Deed are the three major Pinkie epsiodes.
BUT SCREW IT! I MUST SEE IT ON STREAM!
Baby Cakes mainly focuses on Pinkie being pissed off that no one ever takes her seriosuly.
DocSane, Baby Cakes?
oh
why do i see korra?
DocSane: ahh of course, i wasnt thinking correctly for some reason, brain was saying cutie mark chronicles and party of one were the same
wow, this debate's still going?
Say going to bed, decide to check stream out. It's Legend of Korra. Fml, staying awake.
And THAT theme is repeated in Feeling Pinkie Keen and Swarm of the Century.
Dken2021: what is this debate about?
goodnight Meanwhile
Hey, atleast it's intellegent conversation and not just stupid "best pony debates"
Dken2021: What part of "staying awake" slipped by you? :P
Gnight, Meanwhile. Take care, man.
DocSane: DocSane her reactions are extremely different in those 3 eps. and when are those reactions shown in those two eps?
Oh wait.
00,10lol
/me bonks Ninjazz with a plank.
Meanwhile the part with me being tired
/me scratches his head :P
Sorry.
Dken2021: It's 6:30 AM from my perspective, suck it up.
ingwaz: Well, she wasn't upset in Pinkie Keen, just kind of bemused that Twi didn't believe in her Pinkie Sense.
DocSane: dont really see how that relates to this
ha i rlly should get therapy
ingwaz: It doesn't. I was just pointing out the themes of the OTHER major Pinkie Pie episodes.
i dont think they could tell me anything intelligent or real answers
DocSane: thats a pretty big jump from confusion that a friend doesnt believe you about something to not being happy means you're a depressed psychopath
All I hear is Zuko.
Yup.
Yea, that's what I'm hearing, Ninjazz
ingwaz: I never said she's a depressed psychopath. I said she's extremely insecure and has a neurotic need to make others happy.
Und dann planes.
ugh.
00,10He's the love child of Zuko and Iroh
Sumica: Yup
Sumica: ...dude.
Oh mai~
:D
DocSane: were you not saying that if she was not happy she would basically go back to how she was when she freaked out in party of one?
It's freakin' Pearl Harbor all over again! D:
that sounded so wrong sumi
00,10forgot this file has a bad section
ingwaz, DocSane would you two mind moving this in a pm?
ingwaz: No, I said that she operates under a general fear of not being happy.
Actually, it's 1:30 AM and I should really go to sleep.
This is so WW2.
DocSane: well, i still disagree with that but its not as extreme. we've been asked to stop as well, and i need to sleep
eh, I guess bed for me then, have fun with your korra and pinkie debate
Night Dken2021
..
DocSane: so, you keep your head canon to your head, and i'll keep mine
00,10more clse to ww1 in most sence
With... that extra Water Sprite in the middle.
Sumica: ^
goodninght DocSane
DocSane: and lets never do this again
Gnight, Dken2021. Take care. :)
ingwaz: Why not? It was interesting.
night Dken2021
Well... The plane design is WW1, but the ships and weapons are most WW2-ish.
00,10Irohman gives no damn about your bombs
DocSane: interesting but tedious, and as others have said, pretty pointless. and its late, and i have work in 6 hours
...
?
ingwaz: What point is there to IRC if not to debate absurd minutiae?
GOD damnit..
Sumica: I take it you've seen that picture huh?
00,10Just a few of them
hi
Hello there.
there is no hope
i wish they would put her there again
and find a real way out
i dont think anyone realizes how bad this life is
DocSane: i'm not going to resopnd to that, because i just about did with a debate
..
too much cofee. hands are shaking. and im grinding my teeth.
DocSane: NOT AGAIN
Bumi is best commander.
Alchemist: thats bad for your teeth
Actually Dick Shep is best commander. :I
I'm sorry...DocSane's comment about IRC just made me laugh XD
ingwaz: i know, it will go away soon :D
It reminds me of an XKCD comic
http://www.ncregister.com/images/uploads/duty_calls.png
that one OtakuTom?
eeyup
OtakuTom: yep, i showed that on here earlier...
Disclosure: I get invited to cons as a guest to have panels exactly like this debate.
what?
EQD posted that twice
Gamer_Luna: hai
So you might notice that I like to debate and analyze.
CrimsonPhoenix: suspected its because the original post showed the video, which was supposed to be after the break
I like this hobo
lol...whatnow, Gamer_Luna?
Gamer_Luna: Hi there, having fun I'd hope
Allo Gamer_Luna.
Anyway, good night, everyone.
Ah
00,10that whole walking under water thing must be a trip
analyze wat i should do
Hey there, Gamer_Luna.
aww
Gnight, DocSane. Take care.
Later, all.
see ya
bye DocSane
DUN DUN DUUUUUN
story time!!!!
Gasp
*le gasp*
seriously that shocked me
He bends... How?...
Plastic surgery
Plastic surgery in this time and age?... Medical science advances ALOT in 100 years.
i havent watched this show in a long time... whats a blood bender?
the correct question is, will it bend?
blood bender blends blood
DashieMusic2: A water bender who can bend blood in a similar fashion
Ninjazz: well there was a 100 year war and it should had stopped technologic advance a bit
00,10DashieMusic2, they are advanced water benders
bends**
CrimsonPhoenix: http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120201175507/fantendo/images/thumb/4/48/You_dont_say.png/453px-You_dont_say.png
Just like how metal bending is an advanced form of earth bending.
well that explains it
Way more rarer than metal bending
ingwaz, don't EVER use that stupid picture at me
Metal bending can be learned by any earth bender
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: True. True. And since the water benders are the Healers of the world and they were losing, it only makes sense.
Blood bending is a trait you have to possess.
isn't he the Fire Emperor?! :O
yeah, i dont really care for orders from those who are not my superiors CrimsonPhoenix
Great now there will be no Cow level :'(
....
CrimsonPhoenix: i'll respond reasonably to requests, but not so much to orders
This game is a silly filly
Well then please don't use that picture again
towards me
D'aawwwww
Dance, puppets! Dance!
Dances with wolves!
CrimsonPhoenix: i'll try to remember that, but if i do then youll have to excuse me. i like to be snarky for fun
His stare...
It's way too OP.
Bow to me
indeed
ingwaz, it's jsut I despise reddit and every joke they trash down to oblivion
just**
CrimsonPhoenix: i just have fun with it
11,01I think I'll trade away my flaming boxes.
00,10I know Shamroc wants em
CrimsonPhoenix: i dont really go on reddit either so its entirely possible if i were to send you another link at some point you might have seen it and come to hate it because of reddit
I wonder how getting Blood Bended feels like...
11,01Can he give me keys for them?
Ninjazz: uhh...like sunshine and rainbows?
Sumica: nope already got a pair
Big brother, best friend forever
Ninjazz: kind of like how the pyro sees the world
Nittany_Discord: nope.jpg
Sumica: and i doubt i'll be gettin more money to get more
Ninjazz: probably like a bee sting to the eyeball
/me scratches his eye at that thought
11,01Dick move of Valve to do that TBH.
That's what valve do all the time though.
Nittany_Discord, what do you mean?
Nittany_Discord: Well its Trade Fortress 2
00,10what did they do?
about the whole gender still being a mystery?
I LOVE them doing that
11,01Craft drop items into something you have to pay to unlock.
oh
00,10ah
that sounds bullshit
It does sound kinda dick-ish. But you ain't being forced.
Just... encouraged.
anyone have any videos or pics that can cheer me up?
HI :)
Deeeeeeeeeerp
Hey there, ACS13123.
If this is book one , does that mean the show will get more seasons ?
hey ACS13123
Alister: just 2 seasons
HOPEFULLY, Alister.
Alister: The series was planned to be more than 1 season long.
Kinda

wait wut?
so much deus ex in this episode
Meanwhile: Maybe. They actually care about their customers. More so than other companies, atleast.
oh no
yep
And then the show ended
00,10shows over
Rain: Inorite
It ticks me off.
Meanwhile: why dont you shoot me in the head while your're at it :3
00,10we now go back to the awsome that is irohman
one just doesnt "destroy" the avatar... :)
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I'd love to.
Irohman, awaaaaay.
IROHMAN
BF3 plane skills
This finale should have been awesome, but with all the Deus Ex, I dislike it more every time I think about it. :/
Deux Ex?
GUYS!YOU WANNA SEE A PICTURE OF ME???
./)Nickelodeon(\
Deus**
That's a good bomb drop
lol
This is the only good show on Nick Currently
Not the Faec.
This is, seriously, one of the most over-the-top action scenes in US animation EVER.
Crimson: Haven't seen the finale I take it?
Kencolt: ^
I did
Emon is avatar Ang!??!?!
Then you should know the deus ex in this ep already. p
*:P
nope
OneTrickPony: Actually he just stuck that mask over the statue for giggles.
I just don't get that expression
ever
Even in the future, Zuko and Ang are still friends. Friendship.
heheh
Meanwhile: XD
Ninjazz: is magic
Indeed.

lol
o.o
epic dodge
CrimsonPhoenix: It's an expression used when writers use some outside force to resolve a conflict.
Life Insurance...
See, that was one of the good parts.
:'(

Yay I returned
Outside force usually being something pulled out of nowhere.
nice upper cut
MOUSTACHE GUY

YEAAAAAAAAH

and bang
Windburst to the face.
I know kung fu!
He's a big, fat phony!
^
yeahuhg
she spirited
Wind beats everything
even it i reencode the english audio, i still can't fit this on a BD23 =\
And with three elements, she can't touch him. But one element? TOTALLY ENOUGH.
to be honest CK|Basara I enjoyed that sudden wind bending
:3
fake scar is fake
Nice going numbnuts
CK SURPRISED
that Wah face
Crimson: It makes no sense in any real context. :p
He dun goofed.
00,10still say he should have used lighting
Ninjazz: IKR
burn his ass
All is well in Union City.
Eh, too much water. The charge would've never touched him.
Sumica: then wouldnt the whole area be electrified killing fish
Even in salt water, a little bolt like firebenders use wouldn't electrocute that much water.
00,10saltwater would conduct just fine to keep him from geting far
CK|Basara, I'm not comfortable with you...
Not enough of a charge.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I could go for some fish.
Bumi is best Commander
Dat Bumi
Commander Bumi!:D
I'm on a boat!

OtakuTom: You mean "Amon a Boat"
lol
And then best part.

Whoa...
like a boss
wow
See? Best part.
Indeed, CK.
Korras Parents!
ALMOST made me forget that Tarrlok was a lying, double-crossing evil dick who wanted to control Republic City.
Almost.
life is pointless but death is more pointless
But still a solid redemption moment.
"Best Healer"
lol nope
/me slapped himself
It's going to be alr-"nope"
00,10only no one knows of the remdetion
Actually Korra, yes, it WILL be alright, because deus ex number two is still coming up
remdetion?
lol
remediateion, I am guessing
ok here's my tw bits
bleh...
Redemption, I think.
remediation
I'm ok with the sudden air bending
Sumica: Seppuku , in this case, by explosion, is a very private thing. Well, except for the very loud noise.
Sumica: Pft, WE know. That's all that matters.
but that deus ex number 2 I could go without
maybe. i don't know the syntax
doh that buffer
Buffar?
Buuufffrrrr
I love you too, buffer.
Now please kiss.
dat buffer
Really? Stream has to derp right then?!
Ninjazz: Lol
kissy tiem
Meanwhile: Beat me to it. :P
Stream couldn't take it :P
Screen Shot time
00,10I think my net is dieing
too much wub for one stream
The buffer has always loved us.
I'm ganna slap you softly, Korra.
My parents wouldn't approve if I married a loading screen.
XD
:D
Yep, it will take time. so much time.
It'll take exactly a minute of time
00,10yep a good 3 min
Sumica: better than mine
Whoa dat skip
:'(
what
Wth
o.O
inb4 deus ex machina
What is going on.
lol funny
Well that was random.
replay?
The Tardis done gone broke on us.
Tenson is now Ang?!? so many plot twists!
03or just buy some burnable DLs
i just joined and what did i miss?
deja vu! someone is hacking the matrix!
everything?
Rain: This deus ex makes me SO mad, too.
Because it is TOTALLY unnecessary.
Eh, I'm less inclined to consider this a deus ex because the avatar state is a pretty well established thing.
aang is still best avatar
CK|Basara, I could agree on you with THAT one
Actually, if you think about it hard, the blood bending is what caused the benders to lose one's bending. So by using energy bending, it can restore back. It isn't like what Aang did to the Fire Lord
I loved the gif where Aang is Nigel.
but I still nod to the sudden air bending
It's ANG!
wow
CK|Basara: I've come to the view that it's NOT a Deus Ex, but a part of the Avatar Process.
Tenson is best Aang
suddenly Aang, Kyoshi and Roku
ITS AAAAAAAAAAANG
/me squees
HUZZAH
Aang: "So I'll be taking your airbending now."
Roku =D
o_O
indurring element pulses
:'(
Damn...adult Aang...master of deus ex bending
And then she op'd
Kencolt: No, the avatar process was clearly shown and described in TLA.
Are we watching the finale then?
dat avatar state
Korra just went full avatar.
This is Aang giving her all of her powers back because YAY HAPPY ENDING.
Reikim: no we're watching the pilot
It's *bullshit*.
Yeah well, kids channel.
you never go full avatar
Well I missed it, but hey, I've already seen it.
What ya gonna do
:')
CK|Basara: Was it? I think that Avatar barely scrtached the durface... and it's not always going to be same from incarnation to incarnation.
Korra is, quite honestly, my favourite character.
And then they made all the babies
I would prefer if she got with the other brother, and not that one
wat
Almost way to much happened in the first season. @~@
I agree with Rain. Bolin is awesome.
Meanwhile: In TLA, this would've been dealt with by sending him on some sort of spiritual journey. :P
how about,,, reeencoding it to QP0 ?
yayz
00,10wait for stream to catch up then killing it to clear cache
ohai everypony!
0o0
No Tigertortoise required
hai somepony_else
CK|Basara: Not enough airtime
You are now a full avatar , even thoug you only got lucky in your fights and never learnd anything!
They have a second season, that's plenty of time.
now we watch Angel Beats
which would make for a badass second season
DAWWWWWWWWWWWW
Hey guys heh i just watched the goodest stuff i ever saw hahahahaha
They're the ones who chose to bind themselves to a 12-ep miniseries.
awwwww
Season 2 is gonna end up like Matrix Reloaded.
But CK|Basara I'm still ok with that sudden airbending
CK|Basara: Guess you should tell them that. :s
When they could have walked into Nick's offices and picked their choice of season length. >_>
I saw the air bending coming from a mile away, to tell you the truth lol
hm, mb the BD is a bit darker than the ITUNES
oh man it was good i mean holy crap it was amazing
But it was good :P
credits aren't redone, my memory was wrong
CK|Basara: Or maybe it's that she didn'tNEED a Spiritual Journey. UNlike Aang, who until nearly the end, Korra was never conflicted about being the Avatar. She mere was frustrated at not quite getting Airbending.
but both have some film jitter

whoooo!
I'm still a little upset that it's gone by this fast. There's only 14 episodes left now.
Crimson: I'm really not. They don't explain it, which is part of what annoys me. Supposedly Amon took her bending ability, she should not be able to suddenly develop bending again.
wow weee
Spanish Inquisition?
So what's this, ooh?
It's Blood Moon.
Amon used "blood bending" to take the bending away
No I was wrong.
Oh hey it's that weird show with the sponsored heroes.
If it wasn't for the "I was born knowing 3 elements" part. I'd've been annoyed by the sudden airbending.
Kencolt: She never had to do half the stuff Aang did, that's part of the problem. :p
Nothing don't worry about it
Why does this sound like...
Now, look at Aang's case against the fire lord. He used energybending to do that, which is more fatal than the blood bending
:O
Japanese Batman?
what a twist
03so
The other thing to remember is that there are going to be other books to get more in detail with the plot lol. This isn't the only book that's in the sequel >.>
No hahahaha

03FMA's going to buy me ~15 Pokémon phone charms

Sumica knows what I mean
03they're Pikachu + random 5th gens
03I figure I can give some away
hot_luna is hot?
I think if they had extended it to a 39 episode (3 season) series, they could have pushed this arc to 2 seasons to really give more conflict between the benders and the separatists.
Kencolt: Unlocking chakras? Nope. Train elements on-screen? Silly viewer, we'll do three of them off-screen and barely allude to the fourth. Aang had a damn tough journey, Korra played in Easy Mode.
00,10Ran ran ruuu?
Nope not even close
rang ramg?
CK|Basara: Actually, we don't know that for sure since we don't see that
03WMP can play BD?
00,10pay no mind korra was training from lie 4 to be the avatar
I think the real issue with Korra is that it tried to do too much.
CK|Basara: We were only shown on what she was doing in training as an air bender
Well Korra IS older than Angg?
pony_373: which was very, very little
She did some footwork exercises, and....what else?
Mentality
When?
Well i hate to tell this in the chatroom but here it goes the video i was watching called Jenny and Niki first kiss hahahahahahahahah
They spent the next several eps on that tournament. :P
Remember, Tenzen showed that in order to master air bending, she needed to be patient
no, but it can play m2ts if you anydvd and remuxed BD into mkv if you haali
Yeah, and she never showed patience.
Ever.
CK|Basara: That's the POINT. Aang was NOT a complete Avatar-- because he was conflicted at the start, and didn't until the end truly accept that. (He also skipped his training and instead took a 100 year icenap.) Korra, OTOH< is a nearly complete Avatar, skilled, accepting, and in a rather different world. Different situation. Different evrything. Also, she sure as heck aint a 12 year old.
sorry about hat
why are they shutting down teh TF2 items server??
True...they could have spent the first season focusing on airbending and the pro bending circuit, then introduced the separatists in the 2nd season and really pushed their conflict the whole time...
Plus, look on the rest of the episodes. There are some parts that she had to work with to becoming an air bender. One of them was in the tourny episode
i don't want to go any farther then that
See: her decision to confront Amon directly instead of helping Iroh destroy the airfield, because "she has to do this on her terms". That's the exact OPPOSITE of patience and forethought.
but it was great
CK|Basara: And almost exactly how Aang would have handled it. He was BIG on that very often.
But if you think about it, the threat was Amon. He had the ability to take away the bending
Goodnight everyone!
Night Coolbeanz
wellhm, not exactly a fair comparison since i did denosing on my rip, but BD should have more detail anyway ┐(￣ー￣)┌
:s
gnight Cobellanez
*denoising
Kencolt: You just changed arguments.
:)
Korra sucks at the spiritual aspect of bending, I hope that somehow plays into season 2, although her spiritual bending goes against my hope.
CK|Basara: No. Korra IS Aang reborn. Similar personalities... at times. But in a very very different situation.
Kencolt: From "Aang is an incomplete avatar without training so he's a bad role model to base Korra on" to "and he's the perfect example of how Korra should act".
Those are two entirely opposite stances.
You're welcome to pick one, but not both. :p
CK|Basara: At the end-- he was. I repeat-- Korra was prepared, Aang, until late, denied.
No she wasn't!
this debate is going to go on for hours right?
This debate is daft.
Meanwhile has the right of it.
No part of her plan showed forethought. She charged into a giant meeting of anti-bender people and tried to convince them to listen to her. :P
She's a grade-A dumbass.
OKay then
I think it's late
....did that girl just ride blue fire?
if we're pulling out the name-calling
Well think about one thing: The only thing Amon had was that he was basically scarred by the fire benders and that's how he became
I'm a grade C Dumbass
Amon's a water bender. Amon: No I'm not. Plan foiled.
ck Both stances are the same stance. Korra really knew more about being an Avatar than Aang did. She was dealing with a wall-- as Aang did. She tried to convince people opposed to her to listen-- just as Aang Did. This is NOT being Dumb. THis is being an Avatar-- the embodiment of Balance.
If Amon didn't have the scars, then he would of been completely wrong
xD
pony_373: Um... he DIDN'T have the scars, it was a lie, and they were makeup.
Kencolt: Except that Aang did it in situations where he had an opportunity to succeed. Korra didn't. >_>
Kencolt: No. What I mean is that what Ck said. He said Korra was dumb by just charging in like that, but the thing is, she wasn't expecting a makeup under that mask
Feh, we can't see eye to eye here.
pony_373: Eh, even without the scars, it's the word of their leader against the word of THE symbol of opposition from benders
Not exactly much of a contest
Ah, the Batman argument...
Hey dude you know that video called pinkie pills?
Thanks for the game Shizuka ~
Yeah, thanks Shizuka
Time to stop putting bed off.
it was cool
G'night everypony.
the machine reminds me of Navi...
night Meanwhile!
Night Meanwhile
Kencolt: No, likely not. I'm severely disappointed in the way they did this season. It's still good....but it's like different people picked up TLA and said "we can do better"....and didn't. :/
13any time
nghty Meanwhile
cya Meanwhile
gnight Meanwhile!
have a mean sleep Meanwhile
Gnight, Meanwhile. Take care, man.
Dat advertising
NOW I CAN SAY THAT!
Pepsi Nex
Sure
Man if i had a job like you guys and do the stream i would show you guys something really cool
Anyways, agree to disagree. :P
o.O
CK|Basara: I see it as rather, "We can do different-- 80+ years later?" They aren't trying to tell the same story, after all.
CK|Basara: My view, I guess.
Well it's certainly different. But other than the much improved animation....it feels like such lost potential.
Ah well.
So how do you guys do the stream anyway?
Maybe next season will surprise me
Will be hard to top comedian Amon, though.
....you know, I get the sense this game left all forms of logic at the door.
CK|Basara: So I took a waterbender's bending away the other day. And I said "Cry me a river! Oh wait, you can't!" ... Well I thought it was funny.
Hello. What's playing right now?
HEY EVERYPONY! :)
yay your here
I've just been playing TF2 alot! :P
thats cool
hi Ponies47
Reikim: So I took away an earthbender's powers the other day....man, was that a rocky situation. ....well, I thought it was funny.
11,01Crafted yet another crate.
hey ponies47 i told everypony in the chatroom about interesting stuff
Nittany_Discord: Fun TF2 game huh?
11,01It was.
....so try to reason this one out, if you can.
xxMoopyxx: Really?
yeah
What's this show?
Nittany_Discord: very very fun ;)
Nittany_Discord: -lol
I'm playing a game in which this character is wielding six swords at the same time (three full-sized katana per hand).
CK|Basara: So I took an airbender's powers the other day...told him "You've been naughty. Now you're grounded!" ... Well I thought it was funny.
And you don't want to know
00,10Show is "tiger and bunny"
CK|Basara: Sengoku BAsara?
....and I just picked up a new set of katanas that has THREE blades.
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6bcdipV4C1rs5n2bo1_1280.gif
CK|Basara: That's a total of 9 blades per hand, or 18 blades.
So....that's sort of difficult to understand ._.
Reikim: Indeeds
i0i
Date Masamune is just that much of a badass.
CK|Basara: Sengoku Basara is that kind of game.
Hey ponies47 did i make you tired last night?
Reikim: I know. The anime's pretty hilariously bizarre too
Irish_Pony: I'm saving that.
CK|Basara: Just wait until you get the laser blades. That have giant motorcycle exhausts as sheaths.
Cause Rarity <3
xxMoopyxx: Nope.avi
Ninjazz: :P
Oh ok
Ninjazz: So easy to please xD
lol
Reikim: So I took away a firebender's power about a week ago...now he just seems to have lost his spark. He tried to show me that he still had them, but it was all just smoke and mirrors.
Om: You say that and you keep bringing me Trixie. :|
Ninjazz: Yes. Because its fun.
yo sweetie bell whats up? hows the trying to get a cutie mark coming along?
Grrrr.
:T
Ninjazz: I should draw a Rarity Trixie ship picture fr you. What do ya think hmm?
Oh my
-__-
Reikim: But then, in a show featuring a giant cyborg with a drill lance, a man who wields two scythes at the same time, and a guy wields a shotgun in one hand and a sword in another....I suppose you really HAVE to just give in to the crazy to make a show out of that.
hey Polydunami!
make sure it's sexy, atleast. >.>
OK. And that said it all. Lunatic.
Hey MahBoi777 :3
AND DAT Polydunami!
Hey Ninjazz ;)
And man, does it EVER make a show out of it.
^_^
CK|Basara: "So I met the Wolfbats the other day, and I asked them 'hey, why do you cheat?' And they said, 'Oh, we don't break the rules. We BEND them.'" *silence* "Well I thought it was funny."
Ninjazz: Like I said, easy to please :D
Om: Shaddap. >.>
LOL
Hey hang on a minute ponies47 im going to back out cause the broadcast is offline on my screen here
Reikim: So people were saying how I died in the finale, but the truth is, I'm still AMONgst you. ....well, I thought it was funny.
CK|Basara: I want to kick myself for laughing at that.
CK|Basara: Then you get women who can pull infinite pistols, shotguns, and rocket launchers out of nowhere, and massive tiger guys who can make their horses run up walls...yah.
*yeah
there we go
Reikim: "So, I met the Avatar, and I.. Um.. well, it didn't take. I don't know why. And then my brother blew me up. Big time. Oh, I got nothing."
Reikim: There's only one horse that matters and that's the motorcycle horse.
CK|Basara: God yes.
CK|Basara: All arguments invalidated.
Kencolt: You just need the right elements for the joke.

im off to go to my exam.will be back sometime afternoon. goodbye everyone!
Best horse.
gl
Gnight, Alchemist. Take care and good luck. :)
00,10totaly not the bad guy >_>
CK|Basara: Apparently I don't have access?
If I ever owned a horse, it would have to be that one.
Night Alchemist! :)
bye
Things I've learned from Doctor Who: cave people who lived 100,000 years ago speak slightly broken British English :S
Reikim: wut O.o
CK|Basara: Yeah, I click and it says I can't go.
00,10I think sleep is a good idea.
CK|Basara: Oh, never mind
00,10I am gonna try it
what's sleep?
That's bizarre. I literally just pulled it off of Google search. XD
Sumica: It's not all it's cracked up to be, but it can be fun on occasion.
Yeah, I think I'm finally getting into Doctor Who :$
I still think, on that pic, there is soething... off... about Filly Rarity's tail.
Polydunami: Isn't that just due to the universal translator from the TARDIS?
CK|Basara: Motorbike horse. No other horse needed.
good night
Good night, Sumica. Thanks for Korra!
good night Sumica :)
Really? I'm going from the beginning :3
I should probably sleep too. On the other hand, one more round of Basara would be nice, and I'm aching to kick Yukimura's sorry ass.
Thanks for the stream, Sumi. Sleep well. :)
Rather, I started at the beginning with the First Doctor.
with so many different doctors and so many seasons, it's a little late for me to get into who, just don't want to put the time into it
CK|Basara: Kick his ass. Then kick...what's his name, the purple emo guy. It's fun to beat him up.
Took a pic of myself,look horrible :D
I was about to ask which beginning...lol
Mitsunari? He's such a emo that other emos look at him and go "dude, tone it down"
Polydunami: And thyey DID explain much of that during season one and two of Dr Who Classic. Yeah, seens those that survived.
I hate to say it, but I've only seen 9th doctor and after.
What came first, the avatar or the bending?
Bending.
CK|Basara: On the other hand, it's HILARIOUS when he breaks down. Such ham-fisted acting.
Okee, time for asskicking. :3
Also, I wish I was alive to see those episodes which are missing :(
That's true.
Om: both?:$
MahBoi777: Seems legit
Or is it that instead of which?
There tends to be one lost episode that is found every year...lol
Bah.
All right then. I think I'll follow Sumi's lead and try out sleeping for once. Night, everybody.
Gnight, Reikim. take care. :)
gnight Reikim
it's only one where i am, early yet
Hopefully that Tenth Planet episode can be found.
The one where the Doctor regenerates for the first time
meh. Sleep is for people who don't have to write an article. :/

Hey Polydunami...I'm trying to remember...do you play Minecraft?
Quite minimalistic, the animation.
Polydunami, it's an animatic
wow those response videos
it's not complete
Also, I don't have the full version of Minecraft
Sometimes I fool around in Minecraft Classic, but that's whenever I'm bored.
Which is pretty much all day :3
ok, pyro is smoking pot
Minecraft Creative is the only good minecraft

Dear VALVe: It took tou THIS long,to come up with THAT?! WHAT IN THE ACTUAL F*CK?!
Gah...I just found out what appeared to be a mod is only clever editing...but someone is actually working on making this a real mod... http://youtu.be/wKBSWY2jnGw
ahh disappointing sonic
Good morning Bronystate!
Good evening, MadSurge :3
Uh hes hes like a bear hes like a bear that hates people!
MadSurge: very late at night here in sunny florida :P
Also, you talking about an actual time travel mod?
sonicrainboomer259|b: in Italy it's almost 9 AM :D
I wonder HOW that would be useful in a game like Minecraft :S
Not a time travel mod, but a fully functional TARDIS
Minecraft sucks for me only
Oh my
back
But that's the Doctor's TARDIS
mornin MadSurge!
Morning MahBoi777!
its 12:56 here :P
I mean, as far as I know, only The Doctor's TARDIS is stuck in police box form.
Yes, but that doesn't mean that others can't make theirs look like that, either.
Oh hey Sweetie_Belle, is that noon or midnight?
Plus, it's what we all know and recognize, so why not make it look like that in the mod once it's made?
midnight -.-
i woke up from my bro
I suppose
Sweetie_Belle: =D
/me dances
Sweetie_Belle: -lol you are my favorite filly <3
he had a nightmire and started shaking my bunkbed
>.>
Sweetie_Belle: Also I think yesterday you PM'd me saying hello. Were you going to ask for soemthing?
Or it might have been the day before...cant remember
whats the next trilogy?
iron_edge: i just like to chat...i get bored allot -.-
Sweetie_Belle: But you picked me at complete random?
I think BTTF would have been good...seeing as June 27 is the major date that the movie revolves around :P
K I'm back
Sweetie_Belle: Also type in the first part of my name "Iron" then press tab. It'll help you ping -lol
Or at least it is IIRC.
OneTrickPony: Sup bro /)
oh guess what movie comes out on my birthday
magic mike!
hey Iron_Edge (\
iron_edge: i wanted to know if you had seen Gamer_Luna
Sweetie_Belle: Who are you? Like what did you change your name from?
I dunno about that June 27th thing.
Sweetie_Belle: Or are you brand new here/
hey Iron_Edge, how are ya?
?
MahBoi777: Meh ya' know the reg ^-^
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
good good ^_^
Ohey there, Iron_Edge.
I've never heard of ANY Back to the Future movie referencing the date of June 27th, 2012.
Iron_Edge: Apple_Bloom,but some one took my name DX
derp...it's November 5...there's some scifi movie that has events on June 27
Wait is the stream down now? I'm getting nothing 6_9
It wasn't specific to 2012
Ninjazz: Sup there....-lol trixie lover.
My friend had the movie wrong,
Sweetie_Belle: It may be passcoded.
Woah
I thought June 27 sounded wrong...lol
Iron_Edge: why?
:(
Iron_Edge: What did you just call me? :|
Sweetie_Belle: Depending on how you spell out your name chracters from the show are blocked form being used.
Ninjazz: I was lurking and happened to catch a chat with you and somepony else...
Ninjazz: Seems to me like you trixie and rarity have a thing XD
/me feels his eye twitch
Damn it.
-lol
I'll choose my words carefully from now on... :|
Iron_Edge: Draw eeet :3
Ninjazz: I mean I didnt think anything of it at first till' om offered to draw it and you requested that he "make it sexy"
But I know myself enough to know that I won't be doing that. *sighs*
Ninjazz: -lol you sorta fell into that backstab XD
Iron_Edge: Just for the chance to see Om draw sexy Rarity... yeah, I'll tolerate that Trixie for a second. >.>
Ninjazz: I personally dont see whats so bad about trixie. Sure she show boated but dont we all at some point? -lol
Ninjazz: If anypony deserves hate I'd say diamond tiara. She i made of bitch.
is*
Oh I hate her.
i verily dislike trixie
grooviebones: Why though?
But Diamond Tiara doesn't have a TON of fans.
What did trixie actually do foreal that caused anypony any real distress?
she's an antagonist for a reason, her showboating makes it easy to generally dislike her
Ninjazz: diamond tiara made applebloom doubt her own family
Trixie gets love for being a villain when other ponies like Celestia get hate. Why?
i don't hate her or anything i just dislike her
Ninjazz: You are lucky I don't have confdence in Drawing anything "sexy" as you put it.
Gilda is worst pony
MahBoi777: Agreed
Om: You decided to do it, my friend. It's all you. >:3
MahBoi777: Anypony who makes fluttershy cry is on my kill list >:3
YES
Ninjazz: I was jokeing ._.
Eh. I don't care too much about Flutters either.
OneTrickPony: Rave tiem?
xD
MahBoi777: yup
Ninjazz: Celestia was kind of a let down to me personally
Om: Wait... What?
OneTrickPony, the title tells me that Meanwhile is at the Super Awesome Book Base :3
Ninjazz: How the hell does the pony that RAISES THE BUCKIN SUN lose to one ponys love???
Ninjazz: What?
Polydunami: XD
It's the Worf Effect. Only way to show an enemy is SRS BZNS is to have them defeat your strongest ally.
Iron_Edge: Eh. Just because she raises the sun doesn't make he invicivble as many would LOVE to claim... Well, that was obvious.
Ninjazz: So then the ancient goddess ...sucks...basically?
Ninjazz: The ancient creator......sucks
11,02Cookies O.O
DINNER
No. Just Cadence REALLY loved Shining Armor.
hey BLUPERBRONY|64!
BLUPERBRONY|64: Woot /)
hai BLUPERBRONY|64
Polydunami: HEEEEEEY
And who said Celestia created anything?
Ninjazz: Yeah but for like what? a year or so then they decided to get married?
11,02Hai ^-^
To be fair, Celestia can curbstomp basically anypony... except Discord or Chrysalis-powered-by-Shiny.
Wait, who said Celestia was a freaking GODDESS!?
Iron_Edge: Does that even matter?
Ninjazz: Celestia has been around since grannysmiths day and before then.
are we still streaming?
aaaaaaand bed time for me
Ninjazz: No not really -lol but I just thought it was funny.
gnight CrimsonPhoenix
DashieMusic2: nope
Night everypony
11,02Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
Ninjazz: She didnt put up a real good fight anyways. :/ would have liked to see more from ol' Tia
CrimsonPhoenix: Later bro /)
minimum 1000 years, since it was Celestia who locked Nightmare Moon away... and Discord's first reign of chaos occured before then.
yay 60% for Starcraft 2
11,02Shall I stream now? O.O
Iron_Edge: So would I. But they wanted more of a dramatic ending.
YES
Do what you must, SuperBrony64 :3
SuperBrony64: that would be quite lovely

Iron_Edge: We can't EVERYTHING can we? As much as I loved Rarity CQC <3 I would have liked to see Celestia actually have a damn chance to be loved by the majority of fans instead of being everypony's favorite target for trolling.

Emphasis on admirer.

Okay, I'm done
I had never watched any of the Meet the Team series until just now >_>
Polydunami: You okay, man?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why do you ask?
annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd
I'm gone
/me twitches his eye
Oh... No reason. As long as you are... fine. :$
I'm fine. :)
that awkward moment when you watched meet the TF2 but never played the game
whee
/me pats Polydunami on the back "There, there..."
valoreins: That's not awkward. Try knowing the entire story of Amnesia but being too scared to play it.
valoreins: that was me until it became free :P luckily I watched so many videos before it so I was an instant pro :)
http://youtu.be/D-gfjyqPQLw
:D
Dat X-Com <3
Sorry, it's just that homophobia is one of my Berserk Triggers, if you will.
I return. I had toast. My tum tum feels better
Homophobia? Where?
FairysHuff: facebook page oreo
valoreins i still haven't finished portal nd have the song on my ipad
Ninjazz: X-Com ftw yo
No worries, Polydunami. Tis a problem amongst the younger folks. No need to worry about it in here htough.
FairysHuff: I suck at it, but it's amazing.
valoreins: Huh?
Mutterguy: i know dat feel, i have that song in my laptop :s
Ninjazz: Same. Can't wait for the new one. Hope they don't screw it up.
FairysHuff: The FPS? I'm more excited for a spiritual successor called Xenonaughts.
Hey Ninjazz, does this look like a 22-year-old man to you? http://imgur.com/XzHYp
valoreins: Meh. *Shrugs*
Polydunami: dat pedofile
Who?
yeah that was epic
yes, he does, Polydunami. Who is that stranger? :D
Ninjazz: Didn't you know? O_O Theres a remake of the original X-Com. NOT the fps. The fps has been put on hold indeffinately
Irish_Pony, who's a pedophile?
Hm?
FairysHuff: Oh, yes! I remember! I'm still more excited for the other game.
Polydunami: the pic of the guy you just posted :P
Irish_Pony
Ninjazz: Fair enough
Now... hang on, Poly...
That's a picture of me, Irish_Pony.
/me sighs
:D
Polydunami: o.>O
THE DRAMAAAAAA
OH GOD LD
:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uHHmTSDCvA
I'd be hard-pressed to call a man like that a pedophile, you know.
Polydunami: sorry :(
play nice boys
lol
You guys should kiss and make up. :)
time is lunch
Pedophile? O_O Dammit. My true identity has been discovered. >_> QUICK! To the Pedo-mobile! AWAY!
see ya maybe in a day or more
Ninjazz: =_=
Cya later, Wrek. Enjoy! :D
bye Vacation_Wrek
Irish_Pony: ^_^
No worries. Just don't say pedophile to me again, okay?
ohbai Vacation_Wrek
Bye Wrek
bye Vacation_Wrek
Polydunami: Ok :) *hugs*
Polydunami: I have no idea whats going on. But neither do i really care ^_^
bye Vacation_Wrek
FairysHuff, this is a picture of me. http://imgur.com/XzHYp
:3
Polydunami: And? I don't get it. Your cute... or would be more so if you shaved.
But... the goatee is awesome! D:
Ninjazz: Perhaps. But he'd still look cuter clean shaven
I dunno about getting rid of the facial hair :S
I'd look like a kid without it :$
FairysHuff: To each their own.
Wax it?
Polydunami: It grows back. try it. Take a pic and then let us decide
Why can't we just let him decide? It's his face, after all.
So I'm a bit slow when it comes to noticing things.
That means I just now noticed that the Pyro had a mask with the text "OPTICAL MASK" on it.
Polydunami: But from what I'm imagining in my mind of you minus the facial hair is enough for me to consider you bf worthy material.
gnight bronystate, take care everyone:)
In Meet the Pyro, that is.
MahBoi777: Night night
Kammerjunk: It's not that big of a deal anyways. :D
night MahBoi777
Ninjazz: ...Optical mask? Did you see what the Pyro saw?
EPIC BOSS BATTLE THEME!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXHsMLqFQC0
Kammerjunk: Yes. I did. His "Pyrovision" yes?
(16 bit)
I think I shocked Polydunami with my calling him cute ^_^ LOL
Ninjazz: I mean, in Meet the Spy, for example, the Spy was disguised with an unlockable weapon, which was impossible at the time.
Well...I saw a pic of GL brother and....o_o
Kammerjunk: Wait... What are you getting at?...
FairysHuff, I started growing my facial hair last year and I quite like it.
Mutterguy: wish all videogame music was this good in these days :)
Ninjazz: Nothing, apparently. I just clicked on Day 3, and yes, we get the Pyrovision Goggles.
I have a pic from before the growing out: http://imgur.com/mlZq0
MadSurge reminds me ofFF6 actually
Where did the goatee go?! D:
Fairy fluff (Fair enough). Thats up to you. Still if you feel like getting together some time let me know ^_~
Polydunami: u look very diffrent
Kammerjunk: I see.
Ninjazz: But seriously, though, an Optical Mask hat would be neat.
Mutterguy: kinda, huh? FF6 is my fav by the way
same
FairysHuff, http://imgur.com/mlZq0 this is from a year ago.
Kammerjunk: Agreed, but I need to play TF2 ALOT more than i do now to care about the hats. :T
Ninjazz: But think of the rainbow vision, man!
o__o I just did.
/me needs dat hat
Polydunami: Hmm... both are good. Though you look thinner in the more recent pic
Polydunami: You lose weight or is it just lighting?
Kammerjunk: they said the new stuff would spoil the Meet the Pyro video, so we might get the Love Gun and Rainbow Vision :D
One can only hope.
Well, the collar kind of hides my jawline so it gives the illusion of being bigger :S
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uHHmTSDCvA
Polydunami: Aah. Fairy fluff
Polydunami: Your in the US aren't you?
Polydunami: You got swag
Oh yeah, my Twilight-themed necklace just arrived today.
It's neat.
Oh my
Congrats! I need to get some maor Rarity swag.
twilight necklace u say Kammerjunk?
Thanks. I'm usually not a necklace kind of guy, but I needed more places to put pony swag.
Ninjazz: You have enough Rarity in your computer right now ;)
Actually, I live in Canada. Vancouver, to be exact
CupcakeWarrior: But I need swag I can feel! D:
Polydunami: Still thousands of miles away... ~_~ Damn.
..
Oh, neat. Might be going to Vancouver.
...In 8 years.
debating if i should buy a mlp belt or shirt
/me nuzzles Ninjazz
Polydunami: Well I tell you this much. I'd date you. You are cute.
yes

/me nuzzles CupcakeWarrior back
:3
Thanks FairysHuff. I know that I'm cute but I don't like to flaunt very much :S
<3
Polydunami: Tis fine. I don't like being the centre of attention either

xxMoopyxx: oh hey I live in Fayettvile :P
Wait, what country are danish people from?

CupcakeWarrior: Denmark.
Tiny bunch of islands above Germany.

xxMoopyxx: eeyup

Mutterguy: GOOD GODDESSES! You're right!

TIES?! THEY EXPECT TIES TO SELL?!
because a fellow brony of mine love rarity and wears ties...
Well im going to be busy on Friday dude
I'd buy it. I need more places to put pony swag.
Mutterguy: o_o
Mutterguy: Is it Ninjazz? :D
anypony has seen the meet the pyro?
shouldn't think so
Ten million fluttershy's
Michael: If you believe in magic in a young girl's heart.
:D
Has ANYPONY else received the bronystate newsletter in their inboxes?
no
Ninjazz are you getting PHD in nano chemistry?
>nano
All my please.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I
Mutterguy: Yes.
I don't have a inbox
CRAZY!
And what does nano mean?
Meet the Medic has 11.6 million views and 80,000+ likes, Meet the Pyro has 1.9 million views and 100,000+ likes :O
CupcakeWarrior: A billionth.
it's a dream I have. >.>
Very small.
/me would rather do physics
/me would rather stop time
I support nanotechnology with all my heart.
i think it realstes to solar cell collecting. I think he's using zirconium semi conductors...
Kammerjunk: So do i
Hey guys member this in the naked gun movie 8=====>
I want my goddamn contact lenses with HUD already.
:O
xxMoopyxx: Why can't I hold all these puns?
hahahahahahahahahha
:0(
Kammerjunk: I wanna make the excuse of running into people and saying ''forgive my interruption my vision is augmented''
xmasskills1: sad clown is sad
I just ordered two MLP shirts.
Hey can i tell everypony something real quick?
http://www.redbubble.com/people/northerndash/works/8083175-science?utm_campaign=order&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RB
Other than nanotechnology, I want stem cell research to hurry up already.
FairysHuff: Oh, awesome.
http://www.redbubble.com/people/zendric/works/7719821-flutter-rage?utm_campaign=order&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RB
Whats nanotechnology? :S
Kammerjunk i want new lungs :(
CupcakeWarrior: What Tom have you been living under?
CupcakeWarrior: dont play coi you know what it is
nanotechnology? He's not here, is she?
CupcakeWarrior: Nanotechnology is the study of manipulating stuff on an atomic and molecular scale.
FairysHuff: I love Flutterrage :D
I havent been paying attention to scientific advances for some reason
CupcakeWarrior: Nanotech is when they shirnk kittens down to the size of cells and inject them in mice
MadSurge: :[
<3
nanotech clothes, i've heard of it
CupcakeWarrior: Fair enough. It -is- a relativel recent development.
valoreins: So have I. Do want.
I have been doing cock push up its were you have to lay down flat on the grounf and then you let your boner lift you up off the ground
MadSurge: I love them both ^_^
rdibp: I'd love her anyway :D
i would rather prefer flutterbitch
xxMoopyxx: dat Tenacious D
valoreins: Are you talking about the jacket with holes that open and close?
hahahahahahahaha
Wait, whats the point of that?
nope
CupcakeWarrior: The holes open when it detects sweat, allowing in air.
you know whos the voice of that?
Awesome :O
more like a normal clothes using a nanotech that if it spilled with water, the water wont ruin your clothes and it kept dry
the voice of that was Jet Black
Also, guys, people are working on a gun which can quite literally heal you.
Medigun
I'm getting sleepy
?
Quite.
healing gun lol
my problem is... a rarity tie if it was just the coat colour + the cutie mark would mean you'd have to wear non white shirts and that means blazers that aren't black... unless you have some sort of mne and coat coloured pattern
Boner 8===========D
... yep. I'm outta here. Goodnight everypony!
Mutterguy: What about a white jacket and Rarity-mane-colour tie?
Gnight, Polydunami! Take care. :)
Polydunami: Night night
Sweet dreams, Polydunami.
Kammerjunk that's probably fine
Im reminded of the mlp panties that were in an EQD post xD

and Im back. Hello everyone :)
WB Alchemist
passed the exam, got a C, which is good considering that out of 18 people 10 failed :)
... CupcakeWarrior, I hope that doesn't come with the mannequin xD
Ghost says: "Get me out of here egineer ha ha ha ha whoooo!
imma go to sleep now see ya guys tommorrow
Wait, why am I still here?
Alchemist: Resaluta, et gratulatio!
thank you :)
Or "Macte virtute!" Whichever.
Now that I've shared those great shirts with you all. I shall now go play more x-com. Cause I can.
now, I have to endure 8 more hours befor I go to sleep. Been up for 30
FairysHuff: enemy unkown or tftd?
Alchemist: How come?
Kammerjunk: yes
FairysHuff: It's by the guys who did Fallout 1 and 2.
I dunno. I guess the new interface and the faction system didnt do it for me. And the base level soldiers were more inaccurate then the ones in tftd...
Wasteland 2? Ive never even heard of the first one :P
Alchemist: Fairy fluff.
is nothing streaming or is my computer that bad
http://youtu.be/D-gfjyqPQLw
Nothing is streaming
CupcakeWarrior: A bunch of people have. Let me put it like this: The official site for it says "Your mind just exploded like a blood sausage."
Sounds awesome :D
I remember that one of them emptied a full mag on a facehugger (the little yellow blob thingie) point blank and didnt hit once.
That's almost Duke Nukem Forever level of self-worth.
Alchemist: I've never had that problem.
Oh, if you are familiar with Arma 2: DayZ and saw the Walking Dead series, this will be hilarious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1145-xJIsg
Alchemist: Stormtrooper aim at its best :D
Alchemist: That is funny. Even without the references
if you can research heavy plasma and flying suit, you are pretty much sorted even without psy powers.
I was going to play x-com... but I'm getting drowsy now. Think I'll just nap.
Laters.
bye :)
we are the cutie mark crusaders, on a quest to find out who we are, and we will never stop the journey, not until we have you cutie marks!
Oh forgot that this is the dead time period of the chat
that means I can run around naked :D
Ehh, no thanks
damn, I though noone was watching
Sorry, I'm rewatching Meet the Pyro again and again.
If you believe in magic, come along with me. We'll dance until morning, just you and me.
I believe in ponies :D
is the flamewar still raging?
Im already listening to the 10 hour version of fukkireta, I think I'll be good for a while.

Hmm... I need an help with a PC gaming brony here
oni_link: I'm not omniscient, but I'll try.
Krammerjunk: well do you know your stuff when it comes to building a desktop?
Physical desktop?
As in where you place your PC? Or your computer's desktop?
you know whats bull krap
Kammerjunk: man I am just failing tonight... but yes :)
oni_link: I'm not sure what you mean with "building" it.
Oh, you mean a desktop computer.
Sorry, I'm a bit slow.
moin everypony
when you go to a website to download something and end up clicking on a ad that says download, theyre everywhere
Salve, Invi.
Hey there, Invi. :)
oni_link: I have some experience in the matter.
Kammerjunk: I need a second opinion for what will actually go in it lol
/me salhoofs Kammerjunk
heya
Hi Invi.
hey there, Chrysalis. :)
how are people today?
ive seemed to have missplaced my headphones
oni_link: Do you have anything in mind?
Tired.
brb
/me huggles Ninjazz XAX and waves to Chrysalis
Chrysalis: I am that I am.
Kammerjunk: Well I don't know if I should go with AMD in terms of a processor or just play it safe with Intel
awesome
what did people think of Meet The Pyro
oni_link: Well, I have an AMD from a year back. I haven't had any problems with it yet. I don't really think I've used an Intel for a long time, really.
ahhh darn you flash!!!!!
Oh, Flash crashes. You are so random.
XAX: The body is ready.
Kammerjunk: :D So what do you think? I could easily go with a 6 core on AMD but I don't know if it's worth it. I can always just get a quad core on Intel
f
anything after 4 is a waste atm
hoorah!!
hell, most games etc are still built for dual
oni_link: I agree with Chrysalis that you don't need any more than X4, and right now, I have an AMD which I got a year back. I haven't had any problems with it so far. I don't even think I've used intel for a very long time.
oooh lightning
i still got my core-2 quad in my machine
a bigger graphics card is better than a bigger cpu
Well Chrysalis and Kammerjunk, that may be true right now but wouldn't you think it would be a wise investment?
Chrysalis: darn a moment too late lol
lol http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arH3od_2xIg
Rainfall_Night man that vid
it keeps getting revived
:D
i have 6 chickens
It loops!
you guys seen PyroLand ingame yetr?
1 is named scootaloo
As Chrysalis said*
in all fairness even a 2 year old card works fine
just turn down the settings
I had an X4 black edition, it was pretty good.. Maybe I should just stick with AMD?
this Iris chat seems to have the need to getting used to.
Rainfall_Night
i love that beep
Beep boop, son.
Beep boop.
beep boop
hia all
For most users there is no difference between intel and amd, except intel are more expensive
hey trollhunter
Hello there, trollhunter.
oni_link: I'd say so, yeah. I'm hopefully getting a new CPU soon, but I don't know what the newest products are at the moment.
theres a new tech from intel
which is quite good
amd havnt done anything meaningful in a while
no stream or dos my internet suck
anyone up for some hay fries
no stream
Chrysalis: yeah and with the difference, i can go all out with the graphics card. I really want to stick with ATI, are you familiar with their products to help me out with that too?
Chrysalis: Not surprised, really. No doubt I'm being influenced by my inherent need to not choose the leading brand.
Rainfall_Night: sounds good, count me in!
they should sell those at fast food
youd proboly get sick though
Rainfall_Night: :D im still willing to try it
yay
btw, a new nova rage video is up :)
nova rage ?
so WHEN did meet the pyro come out??? Somepony said it was out
uberhaxornova
oni_link: yesterday
Kammerjunk usually the leading brand is leading for a reason
:O
intel chips are BETTER than amd
its just most people wont see that
but as for GPU
i always run ATI, so iv not had much to compare in terms of
trollhunter: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv4B7avZn5Q
Chrysalis: Well I'm willing to hear your input. What and why should i consider Intel?
but i belive the ATI ones are more powerful, while nVidia tend to make ones which last a bit longer
Chrysalis: I know, I know. It's the same reason I don't buy popular brand clothes or have an iPhone.
HOLY CRAP!!! ITS THURSDAY!?!?!
oni_link, intel ones are far easier to overclock and maintain stability at far higher freqeucnies
orly
also, their ivy bridge should add some really nice performance
and the latest tech lets you boost cache performance if you have an SSD in the primary sata
Chrysalis: Ivy Bridge... I forgot that was out too. Man, I feel like ive been living in a cave
I'll be back in an 1 hour and 20 minutes for a semi relevelnt video (only relevent in NZ but meh...yay time zone!)
I have never overclocked my processor, actually.
also, I'm finally gonna get an ssd. :) Any brand do better than the others?
/me is eating a klondike bar :)
Mine was at 3.7ghz when I got it
No need to overclock: really.
XAX: What chipset are you using??
Oh right, I never got that down completely either. What advantages does SSD have over HDD?
Kammerjunk raw speed
Kammerjunk: Faster reading rates I believe
/me is being ignorred :(
Ah.
SSDs are incredibly fast for read/write
and much better in terms of random read/write
/me pats rdibp on the head
which hdds can struggle with
:)
/me purs
anyone have any video that i can watch
Chrysalis: Don't they have a longer life span too?
/me gasps at the purring
:D
typing with an ipad in bed while teamviewing your pc is hard
Well, I just got a 2 TB harddisk 2-3 months ago, and I need a new one soon.
if its for primary storage, go for HDD
oni_link: Intel I5 2500K
kammerjunk: wtf did you do with that space lol
much better cost per gigabyte
Kammerjunk: :O
but for OS/Games then SSD gives a better performance
Oh no, I'll be moving all my pirated games and media to my file server, then I'll format everything.
books?
Chrysalis: One thing I can give Apple is their peripherals. I plan on buying a Time Capsule cause I need it for Storage and to replace my old router
I still don't have enough books, though.
a book is,t that big i think
ew apple
the single worst brand ever made
over priced, under featured
forgive my typos, typing on ipad
Chrysalis: well I am not an isheep. you can lower your guard :D
not really guard
i just pity anyone who fell for the shiny case
and wasted so muhc of their money
Getting an Android was the best decision of my life.
dont you hate the part on the star wars blue-rays when vader says noooo as he throughs the emperor over the railing
Chrysalis: Only thing i want is their Storage solution. And in terms of Phone os, IM ALL ANDROID
unessesarry change
Kammerjunk: /)
oni_link: (\
so the time capsule is just a NAS with wifi
/) /) /) /) for everypony! :D
(\
Chrysalis: I am willing to get something else if its cheaper. Good god, if there is tell me!
Oh right, Chrysalis, what do you make of a certain harddisk manufacturer stating that they'll have a 1.2 petabyte harddisk out in 2-4 years?
Kammerjunk that seems fine
killerpony: (\ better late than never :D
when we move to hologrpahic storage and blu-ray dies
we can see 1-2tb on an optical disk
rember tha part in naked gun 33 1/3 when hes driving through everything even
so hd sizes like that seem reasonable
I'd say that with a petabyte, I'll never need to buy a disk again, but I've already made that mistake.
also, 1min of googling, and an equivelant to the time capsule, including wifi, and extra features such as phone and windows support
LESS than half the price
Pardon, time capsule?
Oh. Apple-stuff.
£250 for the apple version, £120 for a western digital version
Well, what'd you expect from Apple?
over priced, under featured, and so much locking its unusable for anyone who has a preference
but oni_link was saying he was after an alternative
just look for a NAS
(Network Attatched Storage)
apple do a damn good job of making their users blind to the phrases everyone else uses so they can't get away
Chrysalis: Well Thanks :) this is what happens when your brother you talk and work with everyday is an iSheep :D
Meh. Microsoft did some dumb things too.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_QZMroHxc&feature=autoplay&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&playnext=4
Kammerjunk as have linux
But yeah, I hate Apple as much as the next bloke.
no OS is a single solution
I actually plan on going with Ubuntu as a dual boot with Win7
hell, my main machine runs both windows and linux, and my remote servers are all linux based
ubuntu is a good starting point, its the most user friendly of the other distros

A party!
BEEP
Pinkie <3
00,02this game seems to be centered around teritory control
is this dj alex
I'm more a Twilight kind of guy, but Pinkie is definitely my second most favourite pony.
trollhunter: Yes.
dat pinkie pie
Pyro being replaced by Pinkie makes so much more sense now :D
Wait... This is... What was it called again?
Kammerjunk: She's mine too.
Kammerjunk: I can't honestly choose
Kammerjunk: it's okay, you still like her :)
cupcakes
I like everypony!
Except Blueblood.
^
i hate blueblood
so rude
And Diamond Tiara :D
What game is this?
^
Trixie wants to be famous, Gilda wants her friend back, Blueblood is just a brat.
/me coughs Trixie's name
Kammerjunk: i can agree with that. Maybe Diamond Tiara and Angel.
>.>
Dat spraying
+Phase4 dont die
But Angel was so sweet in the other episodes. :(
00,02i'm not sure what i'm doing
Ninjazz: I dont like what he became
buffer
00,02too mug lag
Hi everypony!
00,02319ms ping
Salve, MysteryPony!
Trixie is not THAT annoying, she just has an ego too much big for her own good
00,02^
Phase4: srsly dafuq?
/me hugs Kammerjunk!
about dat ping that is
Aye. As I said, Trixie wants to be famous, Gilda wants her friend back, Blueblood is just spoiled.
00,02i would like to see another trixie ep
:|
As would I, but I know it to be unlikely.
what up MysteryPony
DED
trollhunter: nothing spesial! just woke up!
/me gives a late wave to MysteryPony
Ninjazz: If he redeems himself, I'll change my opinion of him
/me hugs Ninjazz! and trollhunter!
shes a pony
oni_link: How has he not? He's Flutter's contrast. Plus... how can you be so mean to such a cute wittle bunny? What would Flutters think? :(
Dat VIP remix
Ninjazz: dont... dont give me that face :( but I did like him at first but now its like meh.
who is that
For one thing, Angel isn't your stereotypical fearful and timid bunny rabbit
^
MadSurge: I will give him that, yes.
Brb lunch
lol
k
oni_link: I'll just say that there are FAR worse things to hate. :(
its lunch for you
i used to be up all night and asleep through the day
Oh right, have you guys heard of HAL 5?
i hated it
Ninjazz: hate is not what im feeling. hate a strong word, Id say im just not too fond of Angel now.
Kammerjunk: nope
the interwebs has spoken! we need more pinki in this chat!
oni_link: Ah. Understood.
Even then, he's still was too sweet not to like. :(
Ninjazz: was. :P
Episode 22 in season 2.
http://derpy.me/VRKph - Meet Hybrid Assertive Limb 5, or HAL 5. It's an "artificial powered exoskeleton". It allows the user to carry 5 times the weight they normally could.
it was pretty recent.
Basically, it turns you into Iron Man.
Kammerjunk: but does it blend?
Kammerjunk: Is that real?!
huh, i thought i still had this installed
Ninjazz: Yup. It's called HAL. And it's made by Cyberdyne.
Kammerjunk: I can see it becoming wide spread within heavy lifting jobs etc
I wish I was kidding there.
killerpony7733: or in boxing!
if that sute is real thats fucking awesome
Kammerjunk: Ho-ly crap. The things we're doing...
MysteryPony: That is a silly use for it tbh
Kammerjunk: The question on everyponys mind is Will it run Crysis??
oni_link: It can run Chrysis THRICE.
But no, you don't get to shoot lasers out of your hands.
I see, so this game is called Nuclear Dawn
:D and i am impressed. Iron Man might actually happen within my lifetime :D
money is the best super power
trollhunter: i see what you did there
Kammerjunk: okay you use that suit i want this one!!! http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/12/kristof_e2_440.jpg
oni_link: Oh yeah, and a bunch of eggheads want to make telekinesis.
trollhunter: I agree, though it's more of a regular power.
Kammerjunk: really now??
Rainfall_Night: haha you dont say??
oni_link: It's called the Brain-Gate Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems. Or BGNIS.
Sorry, I mean Brain-Gate Neural Interface System.
00,02i'm terribly confused
Kammerjunk: I will add that to my notes and keep my eye on it
00,02tf2 does this to you
mmm tf2
hmmm cake!
Phase4: well I dont blame you, at least you were stuck on something good :D
Good morning, everypony! :)
RaveBrony: good morning!
hello RaveBrony!
/me hugs RaveBrony !
hey bravepony
00,02yeah
00,02this lacks the polish of tf2
aahh I meant RaveBrony
Phase4: its not as easy on the eyes imo.
Lol :D
00,02yeah
Phase4: lol nothing can rly compear to the polish og tf2!
00,02nothings colour coded
00,02i have no clue who's shooting me
00,02or where i'm going
Phase4: how is it for gameplay?
Well, this isn't really about the graphics. This is a hybrid genre game.
Nuuuuu, time to go sees muh doctor. Bbs!
Phase4: Just like in real life, now how about that.
RaveBrony: i hope you do!
00,02huh
00,02internet died
00,02anyway, Kandarihu: i'm not arguing the 'quality' of its graphics
Phase4: so it doesnt look as good but does it play alright??
00,02i'm arguing its design
00,02everything is about the same colour
00,02and its too dark
Point taken.
00,02i was navigating with the map and blue arrow things
00,02over the heads of team mates
00,02oni_link, guns are guns
00,02they work like in any source game
00,02the rts part is rts, not that familar with rts and havent played commander yet
ALL THE BLUE TEXT!
I LOVE IT!
MUHAHAHA!
/me 00,02hugs Ninjazz
/me hugs Phase4 back
Phase4: so thats what it was a hybrid of?
^_^
00,02oni_link, yeah
00,02if you heard that guy, he was the commander
when i was really little i thought that if i put a egg under my pillow a dinosaur would hatch
ah now i know thanks for that
00,02he's dropping turrets and suply stations for the troops
00,02who's goal is to gain teritory and resources for the commander
00,02so they can destroy the enemy's base
Pretty cool concept. sounds like a battlefield 2.2 lol
08,01urgh
08,01my god
08,01i should stop eating spicy food
Phase4: any idea what to play now?
08,01the bowels cannae take it, captain
ah
00,02killerpony7733, nope
Phase4: not too bored of L4D2?
wow +Phase4 you have a shit load of games
08,01my lower intestine is currently on fire because i ate a bowl of chilli nachos last night
08,01oni_link: oh don't get me wrong, i love spicy food
00,02magicka demo it is
Magicka!
08,01i grew up in an indian household
00,02trollhunter, that i do
08,01Chrysalis: just my gut
00,02most of them are from the humble bundle's
haha
4hi
08,01Chrysalis: honestly, in last night's nachos, i didn't even taste the chilli
I can't deal with much spice either - I get the worst acid reflux
4where is lighty?
When I eat spicy food, the only thing I burn is my tongue.
08,01everyone else had to leave it because it was too hot for them
/me knows he has heard this song before
Fate?...
Uh oh
Phase4: White screen.
08,01oni_link: maybe i have some kind of ulcer or infection in my lower inestinal tract
Here we go
anything above buffalo medium is too much for me
Nope. magicka.
08,01maybe my gut is just over sensitive
08,01i have no idea
We won't be able to read the text like this.
DAMMUT, PHASE! Why you play when I don't have access to my computer! D:
I just got the humble bundle and I was going to play it but then some one of my friend gave me dark souls
has everypony seen MEET THE PYRO????
MysteryPony: yup. We were playing last night too.
Kandarihu: isnt it awsome???
Yeah
00,02stupid nvidia
00,02its optimus thing is cool and usefull
00,02but broken in implimentation
how do you get desktop ponies to work, it just says you have no ponies installed
:) I learned there was an experience cap in Fable TLC - fighitng undead with physical shield on to prevent the combat multiplier from decreasing everytime I got hit - stops at 999,999 if you don't spend that XP
stopped around 315 CM
Rainfall_Night I t should come with the stock set of ponies.
00,02trying the demo
Cypresswolf: oh man thats the best one of the trilogy imo and i didnt know that either
:O Magika?
What? The text is scaling? Awesome!
bananar
Beat Bargate Prison - my favorite part of the game until you get to the Norther Wastes - just to fight the Kraken & unlimited zombies
This game is awesome to play with trolling buddies :D
This game is full of pop culture references
^
This is relevant to my interests
I got a bit of buffering so I tried refreshing. Big mistake.
Kandarihu: yeah im stuck with the dotted spiratl still
*spiral
Is anyone getting the video?
Hi
Nah
2 game I miss playing are the Bard's Tale & Gauntlet Legends for Playstation - sold those games years ago - must have barely been in highschool
Phase4, stream died
Phase4: we're not seeing this. Mips.tv is having problems
stream is ded
00,02hmmm
00,02how do you code things this badlyt
00,02badly'
00,02i meen srsly
00,02this is more than neglect
Yeah, they messed up a lot in the beginning.
no me gusta
:D Bard's Tale even had musical numbers at certain parts of the storyline - It's Bad Luck to be You is one of my favorites, a trio of goblins come of out nowhere and sing a new verse the further you progress in the game - multiple endings to missions and the end of the game depending on what you choose to do
00,02and then everything broke
http://www.magickapedia.net/wiki/Mea_Culpa_DLC
00,02so yeah
00,02things are broken
Fun fact: in italian, the eponymousness of cowardice is the bunny, not the chicken, which instead is used as a synonimous for "sucker"
has anyone streamed Meet The Pyro yet?
