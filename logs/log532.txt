hehe
most movies from 1990+? are
being the inspiration for the idea, eh?
Rly?
:o
i couldnt care less if it were ponies, kittens, puppies but wat remains the same is the reason i enjoy these things is that they seem to contain a aspect of something i enjoy
^
you didn't care because you only had 2 speakers
amirite?
or I didn't see it in the menus
but yah
i didn't care about surround sound either, until i fixed by soundcard a year ago
I don't know. If it wasn't ponies, I would have definitely found something else to preoccupy me
Using money on items seems... pointless?
0,14Meanwhile: stop starting.
everyone is a slave to the constructs of society
there is no way out
nah, i just bunped some plugs
ppl find artificial happyness in work that seems ur choice
but in the end u have to -choose- something
Also, apparently turning on VLC spatiliser/whatever + adjustments fixes the low speech issues I was having
this creates anxiety for ppl like me
and cant see how anything that i have to choose is going to be fun

Rarity is too mainstream
Rarity. All I'm going to say before the war begins once again.
the more i say the more guilty i feel
nah, it's their fault & i thought that too.

Rarity? mainstream? those word I have not heard together

They need to do an episode similar to Winter Wrap-Up, where they take away the defining thing to Pinie and then see how she deals with it.

That's a good bomb drop
lol
This is the only good show on Nick Currently
Not the Faec.
This is, seriously, one of the most over-the-top action scenes in US animation EVER.
I did
Emon is avatar Ang!??!?!
Then you should know the deus ex in this ep already. p

00,10I think my net is dieing
The buffer has always loved us.
I'm ganna slap you softly, Korra.
My parents wouldn't approve if I married a loading screen.

The Tardis done gone broke on us.
03junh1024-XD, BD Rebuilder?
03or just buy some burnable DLs
deja vu! someone is hacking the matrix!
everything?
Because it is TOTALLY unnecessary.
Eh, I'm less inclined to consider this a deus ex because the avatar state is a pretty well established thing.
aang is still best avatar
but I still nod to the sudden air bending
It's ANG!
wow
Tenson is best Aang
suddenly Aang, Kyoshi and Roku
ITS AAAAAAAAAAANG
/me squees
HUZZAH
Roku =D
o_O
indurring element pulses
:'(
Damn...adult Aang...master of deus ex bending
And then she op'd
Are we watching the finale then?
dat avatar state
Korra just went full avatar.
It's *bullshit*.
Yeah well, kids channel.
you never go full avatar
Well I missed it, but hey, I've already seen it.
:')
Korra is, quite honestly, my favourite character.
And then they made all the babies
I would prefer if she got with the other brother, and not that one
wat
I agree with Rain. Bolin is awesome.
how about,,, reeencoding it to QP0 ?
yayz
0o0
No Tigertortoise required
They have a second season, that's plenty of time.
now we watch Angel Beats
DAWWWWWWWWWWWW
awwwww
Season 2 is gonna end up like Matrix Reloaded.
When they could have walked into Nick's offices and picked their choice of season length. >_>
I saw the air bending coming from a mile away, to tell you the truth lol
hm, mb the BD is a bit darker than the ITUNES
But it was good :P
credits aren't redone, my memory was wrong
but both have some film jitter

whoooo!
I'm still a little upset that it's gone by this fast. There's only 14 episodes left now.
wow weee
Spanish Inquisition?
It's Blood Moon.
Amon used "blood bending" to take the bending away
No I was wrong.
Oh hey it's that weird show with the sponsored heroes.
If it wasn't for the "I was born knowing 3 elements" part. I'd've been annoyed by the sudden airbending.
Nothing don't worry about it
Why does this sound like...
:O
03so
The other thing to remember is that there are going to be other books to get more in detail with the plot lol. This isn't the only book that's in the sequel >.>
No hahahaha
Japanese Ronald McDonald!!
03FMA's going to buy me ~15 Pokémon phone charms
no
03I figure I can give some away
Subliminal messages?
hot_luna is hot?
I think if they had extended it to a 39 episode (3 season) series, they could have pushed this arc to 2 seasons to really give more conflict between the benders and the separatists.
rang ramg?
03WMP can play BD?
00,10pay no mind korra was training from lie 4 to be the avatar
I think the real issue with Korra is that it tried to do too much.
Well Korra IS older than Angg?
She did some footwork exercises, and....what else?
Mentality
When?
They spent the next several eps on that tournament. :P
Remember, Tenzen showed that in order to master air bending, she needed to be patient
no, but it can play m2ts if you anydvd and remuxed BD into mkv if you haali
Yeah, and she never showed patience.
Ever.
sorry about hat
Plus, look on the rest of the episodes. There are some parts that she had to work with to becoming an air bender. One of them was in the tourny episode
i don't want to go any farther then that
but it was great
But if you think about it, the threat was Amon. He had the ability to take away the bending
Goodnight everyone!
Night Coolbeanz
wellhm, not exactly a fair comparison since i did denosing on my rip, but BD should have more detail anyway ┐(￣ー￣)┌
*denoising
:)
Korra sucks at the spiritual aspect of bending, I hope that somehow plays into season 2, although her spiritual bending goes against my hope.
Those are two entirely opposite stances.
You're welcome to pick one, but not both. :p
No she wasn't!
this debate is going to go on for hours right?
This debate is daft.
She's a grade-A dumbass.
OKay then
if we're pulling out the name-calling
ck Both stances are the same stance. Korra really knew more about being an Avatar than Aang did. She was dealing with a wall-- as Aang did. She tried to convince people opposed to her to listen-- just as Aang Did. This is NOT being Dumb. THis is being an Avatar-- the embodiment of Balance.
If Amon didn't have the scars, then he would of been completely wrong
xD
Not exactly much of a contest
it was cool
G'night everypony.
13any time
Dat advertising
NOW I CAN SAY THAT!
Sure
Man if i had a job like you guys and do the stream i would show you guys something really cool

Hello. What's playing right now?

:O
its just most people wont see that
but as for GPU
orly
I have never overclocked my processor, actually.
/me is eating a klondike bar :)
Mine was at 3.7ghz when I got it
No need to overclock: really.

ubuntu is a good starting point, its the most user friendly of the other distros
