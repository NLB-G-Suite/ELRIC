The end result was more prone to introspection on the nature of humanity's relationship with God, using metaphors of adolescence.
sagas: it's not maid hour
Okay, enough of the spinning buffer thing. Good night, everyone.,

Gamer_Luna What kind of voice are you looking for?
I recently read through it, and it's possibly one of my favorite series ever.
He expects his children to look after themselves.

ehm, stop fucking inviting me to Spike.
I do writing and videos, myself.
To underline this point, I would have had the main character have a symbolic scene with her angelic partner, where she helps him up "Not because my God, or any God, tells me to. But because it's what's right."
I've dealt with it for long enough

Mr. Myagi is a troll :3
Cheerilee is best teacher
Dark92Enigma That's not Mako.
Everything goes back to ponies.
SO U LIK PONIES???
i wub ponies
Miyagi's backstory is sad
cutie mark crusaders kung fu thugs!!
lol
dunno how much Jacke Chan knows about real kung fu tho
Lemme guess, point for Jackie Chan because he's Jackie Chan.
11,01Silverscreen recommended this.
This guy is a spectacular critic.
Does Jackie Chan have a moustache?
Well he is Jackie Chan
cutie mark crusaders are awesome. Favorite one is Sweetie Belle.
remake was ok
Lol
chackt chan
Cock- a doodle- do.
Jackie chan doe martial arts, but not kung fu
Lol
brb guys , I have to go wax off
No disrespect to Jackie Chan, but i give it to Mr Miyagi
Nittany_Discord: we need to add a # Octavia channel for something... >.>
Buytoast: Him and Doug Walker are different personas. What's portrayed here is different than Doug's opinion.
Alister: oh god my brain
Never explains?
/me scrub my toilet Daniel San
I love both of them.
he did explain tho
Ka rat ee!
show me your moves!!!
KARATE
lol
This guy is a walking crap bag.
Mr Miyagi DID explain
^
Buytoast: I agree
yes, yes I did
LOL! Alister... You go wax off! :D
Buytoast: I GREATLY agrre
agree*
i like NC, but he made a mistake here
little drunk
Nostalgia Critic?
jackie wins
CrimsonPhoenix: well yeah, thats who this is
a
You forgot the internment camp part NC
Dat is heavy shiz right there...
richfiles: I clap to ponies ( I did not misspelled that)
/me whistles
He has admitted he has made mistakes
twilight_sprinikler wait for Nitchy McPicky to point out that mistake
That guy with the glasses is better
Ninjazz: YOu woul know, ninshiz
Jackie Chan is kewl.
Surprise surprise. He wins because he's Jackie Chan.
^
I need to rewatch the remake, I fell asleep in the middle.
Buytoast: Duh
Guys, did you know that Ask That Guy did something with MLP?
LOL, somepony else said wax off. Just a joke. :P
i liked the original BANZAI scene more
Om: Now that is just dirty.
fire
I KNOW
Neither Win. I think Pinkie Pie wins.
And on his Facebook page said he watched it and he didn't like it much.
Hehe, fresh and juicy.
Old 1: New:1 NO SPOILERS PLEASE
lol pinkie pie wins
Dark92Enigma: Nitchy Mcpicky is just very insulting way of representing his critics
XD
Ninjazz: I'm not the one thinking that way.
Buckin' FIRE!! So can Pinkie! :O
the douchebag villians
Do people actually watch this guy's useless rambling and think he has a good opinion?
the villans arnt very morally ambiguous and are bland
Buytoast: he sometimes does
I like that
Buytoast: I know ! There are way better reviewers online
Buytoast: i mostly watch his stuff for laughs
Aircrafter: ofc Pinkie always wins
Doug Walker's opinions seem sound to me.
lol
Buytoast I watch just for entertainment, I don't consider him an actual reviewer
LOL iwas just wathcing this
:D
Hes just entertaining
GOD I need a Girlfriend lol
=/
I kind of like the teacher being nuts
I trust him and his ilk more than professional critics
yes new one wins
DAYUM
LOL
i may not always agree with NC reviews, but some of his reviews are absolutely hilarious
lol
sounds fun
lol
:D
Haha, I'd totally watch that.
Dark92Enigma my little cousin said I needed one lol
mercys a penis!
PEEEEEEEEEEEEEENISSSSSSSSSSSS
Mercy's a penis!
PPPEEEEEEEEEEEEENIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
guy should get hearing aids
THERE'S NO PONIES IN THIS DOJO!!
pingas
his Schwarznegger week reviews had me cramping up from laughs
Buytoast: I did watch some of his ramblings. He proves a point in most of the things he says, but it also very negative to some movies I watch "for fun"
Tat costume
skeleton costume?
Doug Walker is clearly playing a character, which intention is to entertain us and make us laugh
Which of these is the better villain depending on my outlook on how I interpret a villain? Oh, this guy.
^
grr
Dark92Enigma: In that he fails
Dark92Enigma Thank you.
so much cursing
yeaaahhh!
and he's doing a hell of a job! GO NC!
Seems like this entire review is, do you want fun or a well mad e movie
Curses are best words
mercy's a penis was not funny
:O
Doug hates 80s style bullies
Lol
Nittany_Discord: can we wtach some more NC reviews, like maybe Schwarznegger movie reviews?
lol face
haha mine bitches!
YEEES
lol
I kinda thought the kid in the remake was going to smash the trophy in front of Dre
Nittany_Discord I'd actually vote for his review of Thomas and the Magic Railroad.
I'm still waiting for Doug to review Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night.
Point goes to new guy for being in China.
Oh wow.
Old:1 New:2 NO SPOILERS
Crazy Asian Kid
his reviews aren't even considered reviews, it's just him making fun of the movie's stupidity and writing a script for it
Supporting cast? In Karate Kid?
Buytoast: youre kinda being unobjective too
this is a stupid video, why is he ranting about the two movies?
not the mom... Should do the love intrest
Bluestrom_S: idk but its fun :D
But I'm not plastering my asshole grin on the internet and smugly presenting my point.
Dken2021: pretty much. He does back up his bashings
Bluestrom_S: He's not ranting on the movies
He gives honest opinions at the very end of his reviews.
Bluestrom_S He's not ranting.
bring in Chuck Norris
Bluestrom_S: cuz its a comparison?.
That's what he does
Bluestrom_S: He is the one who those kinds of things
Bluestrom_S: How is this a rant?
HANG YO COAT
Buytoast : I know ! Why review 20 year old movies ?
Plus, I just love picking at these stupid opinionated "reviews".
Dken2021: I think his review of TMNT movie made me quit watching his videos
sorry not rant, but is he comparing them?
stereotypical black woman
who wants a MLP FiM movie? I do.
Alister: "Nostalgia" Critic
they are very different
Doug's review of Breaking Dawn was a rant.
:W
I don't.
these kids and their jackets
Reivews being opinionated? What a tweest!
The Nostalgia Critic is a character, just like Angry Videogame Nerd
Yeah, I stopped watching him too :P
in live action
lol
you mean the bum review?
Depends on how good the movie is
Because reviews TOTALLY are'nt based on opinions
Emo Asian :3
directed by micheal bay.
JK
NC did a small bit about mlp G4
twilight_sprinkler: In reality : Except the ''underrated'' classics reviews , a review of a 20 year old movie is pointless
*shrug*
well at least hes intertaining
He also does reviews out of his Nostalgia Critic persona (As Doug Walker himself) where he gives his real opinion , and has a VERY MUCH CALMER attitude....except when he's taliking about the Twilight movies (at times)
Old:2 New:2
The plot
...
yay story time
Doug Walker is much calmer, but that Twilight review made me wanna hug him.
Neither Wins
wat
I jsut really want to punch this guy in the face.
Cause they become friends :D
im back
STORY for the VICTORY
Magic *snort* *snort*
Alister: pointless for you maybe, others might enjoy old movies, he chose to reviews old movies, its his thing
The story is probably going to go to the new one

It's like calling a movie Troll 2 when it involves goblins. Wait...

Dat Brazil refernce! Baby Cakes music was from dat movie! :)
twilight_sprinkler: look I don't wanna get in a debate about this guy
songs happen when songs happen
not when you want them
FUN FACT: THERE IS a Martial Art in Brazil: CAPOEIRA
LOVE is bloom! A beautiful sandvich! A handsome heavy weapons guy! :P

I'd say it's very advance 8-bit audio, or low end 16-bit audio, but the graphics are 100% 16-Bit minimum.

Ponies47 HEIL DISNEY

Ponies47: That cartoon was nominated to the Oscar
Oh

Paladin_Drakkenwolf: almost certainly anti-Nazi propoganda produced in the early 40s
and allowed NO NORMAL MOVIES and made propaganda
Lessons Learned: The Movie in the top left corner?
jim carey as lady gaga? in bottom left?
so it is NOT disney's fault

CrimsonPhoenix: I'm sure I would but I would rather see it as something happy so please don't tell me how you came to that conclusion

SamanthaGirl159: Sorry. Not going to. LIKE the idea. He'd do it nice. DEAL. And I am immune to duct tape.
0,14isn't reddit up there with TVTropes in terms of time consumption?

They ARE pretty darn red, because it's a night shot. you have to remove th blue filter they use for animating night shots, and then lighten.
/me dances with SamanthaGirl159 and MahBoi777.
well no i take it back, dont damn it
its obvious that we'll never see this couple FOR MANY SEASONS
bless it
this was the best way end a season
twilight_sprinkler: Of course. Twilight wouldn't blindy do the wrong thing. But the background of the story IS a wedding. It's common for sisters to feel jealous. So it's understandable.
:V
I'm back!
wb Canadian_Brony
They might not be firetruck red, but they ar red enough.
wb Canadian_Brony
hi Canadian_Brony

Byea SamanthaGirl159!!!
CrazyCherry probably
Om: dose that mean the best night ever is the best episode?

do not use power tools when loaded.
twilight_sprinkler: They just assume that Twilight was jealous. Based on her past actions, that's not too unbelievable. I mean, they were all working for Cadence after all.
thanks geeky-brony

if requests were still open, i would request loads of hilarious how to.... vids

CrazyCherry . . . I guess. I mean, we're all friends, amiright? I've been here for less than a week now
time to grant an honorary PhD.
Ye
twilight_sprinkler: I agree. But there is only so much you can put in a 45 minute time slot. I'm sure we could have had an award ceremony for Twilight afterwards, but that would have taken too much time.
04Hello mish
I'm pretty sure Bronystate has a rule for something like that

Seapony Lyra! :)
LYRA
twilight_sprinkler: I'm sensing that you only believe that Twilight deserves more than she is getting.
11:22.
Lyra! <3
Ninjazz: from the technical perspective it makes sense, but when viewing them as characters without constraints they seem liek douches
04Because that's what this sounds like
I WAS RIGHT!
ponies look deprssing under these filters
04Or at least the opening did
Lyra is swimming past the show
Luna plot
who called the sea ponies
SOOBEDDOO
shoo be doo...
04Nu metal, alternative metal, whatever
Ninjazz: youre sensing wrong. and im hardly asking for a "ceremony", im just saying they couldve been nicer, thats it
Ghosties: a little

Cutiemarks DO NOT connect! :$
i kind of like this

Ghosties: it sounds like a cheap mashup of some guitar rifs
CrazyCherry I dunno. I've only talked to GilDash once, if memory serves correctly (which it usually doesn't)

What are these 2 and 3 you speak of??? I know only of 1s and 0s
hia lyra
woo lyra
Gaben version?
twilight_sprinkler: Yeah... Alright. At that point Twilight basically accused Cadence as being EVIL, which in Equestrian standards would be pretty harsh. Considering that Twilight has been showing signs of being jealous, they would be justified to a point. But ofcourse, the part EVERYONE putting Twilight down would probably be for dramatic reasons. Don't tell me that part with Celestia didn't hurt.
Lyra was following :D :D
shoop da loop

02::3c
standing on em all day while wearing fancy dress horseshoes. ugh.
02:3c*
bye BuyToast
04but we love you regardless
I won't have time to do anything on monday/tuesday
13LOL
due to band comps
13Thing is I only got like 3 hours of sleep
04Goddamnit NS
i'm not used to it.
so
04stop leaving
13was meant to go to work today but woke up with a horrible stomach ache
I'm not trying to ignore any of you
/me clings
13took the day off
I need to go do my stuff
04Alright
04Good luck and stay focused
13and I've spent the past couple hours doing all the chores in the house for some reason
and replying to Presea's PMs usually means I'm sitting there listening for at least half an hour
and I can't risk that
04Pretty sure he's afk but alright.
Time? Lets green egg and ham it.......
/me pokes Angel's stomach.
13D:
Irish_Pony you are not shaq and he did not make that line work either
:D
04ugh
alexxm: Damn you my back hurts already!
04I hate the uploading policy for DrA art >.>
what happened to your back Irish_Pony
alexxm: Sometimes I laugh so hard it makes my back hurt :P
04Any art/pixel art has to be of DrA dragons, even if you're simply using DrA dragons as mediums for your own characters - say, make a sprite of your character, who has a representation in a DrA dragon, and it won't be accepted.
04which is frustrating if you've already made it asdfghjkl
ah right i didn't know that Irish_Pony
We didn't have dr. Seuss, but we had a pretty good correspondant :D
13upload it anyway and be like "problem? ;3"
now what's happening? I've been reading this book aloud as if I were reading it to somepony for the past 15 mintues
04I can't because it needs to be approved beforehand
04otherwise I totally would
what book have you been reading Canadian_Brony
huzzah i finally got FMLE to work properly.
"How to be a Canadian *(even if you already are one)"
now i just need a better upload speed, so that theres no buffer on my stream
I kid you not
is it good Canadian_Brony
course thats gonna be a problem
:p
alexxm it's filled to the brim with Canadian humour

12._.;
/me smashes his face into his keyboard repeatedly
04Give it time
Simple Plan..
Pre Teen Angst?
what about it Rain? You listen to it?
trying to remember who Simple Plan is
it's a Canadian band. Montreal, to be exact
thats very helpful :|
punk-rock-alternative, I think
/me shrugs, gives up, goes to do something else
its a long vid but i reccomend it cause it shows how shit g3.5 was but in a hilarious way http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJnK_KS4G9k&feature=related
/me cleans his AK-47
Carpathia: I, for one, enjoy all generations of MLP
:|
lol
but... HOW CAN A HUMAN BEING WATCH G3.5... (love and tolerate... love and tolerate...)
I absolutely hate that "Love and tolerate" bull
rain calm down lol
as if anyone who uses the line "love and tolerate" actually practice love and tolerance.
i am tolerating
the only people who say "love and tolerate" are trolls
Carpathia: bile fascination? :D
i could be insulting the shit out of you for watching that g3.5 crap
but im not
:\
good night everyone
*scoffs* as if that is what it means to tolerate
im tolerating your opinion...
jesus, you're dumb
/me laughs
im finding it harder and herder to tolerate you
are you like 8?
and no, Im 20
Love...hate...and tolerance.....
lmao... i posted it just to have a laugh... cause... just... UGH god... if you don't like something you don't have to get all pissy over it
exactly
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O_1iKZGqvI&feature=related --- my reaction to g3.5
bwahaha.
herp
12hmm...
hahaha
12 98% through level 4
My Little Pony = Absolutely terribleï»¿ show. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic = BEST. SHOW. EVER.
12it lied, he isn't ready
lol dragon adopters
Irish_Pony so true
12-_-
bwakakakakaka
also im irish :p
I used to "play" that
or really, use it
I would have to dissagre. While FiM is a good show, I would have to say that Mushi-Shi is better.
I prefer dragoncave
what does you being irish have to do with anything? >_>
04I will say this right now
04G1
04Excellent pilot
Thats like my brother pointing out people from his school and saying "btw, he is gay"
its pointless information
also, yes, Ghosties
Rain: Because being Irish is freaking awsome?
^
12meh
seriously
dang right ghosties!
rain
you're an asshole
12each to their own
nah
nothing beats the demon ponies!
Im just oppinionated
/me 12eats another Skittle
an oppinionated prick
yeah
wait...
correction
hahaha
nothing beats the demonic dragon ponies
what happened to your "love and tolerate" crap? :D
out the window
it doesn't work on some people
exactly
i.e
you
like you?
why should i tolerate an asshole?
as in you went out the window?
<---
uderp
bye bye!
i never said there was anything wrong with dragon adopters, did I?
I only expressed my opinion
04Because then you can't "love and tolerate" if you're not willing to do it all the time
People who /say/ "love and tolerate" are easy to piss off. People who /live/ by such things as love and tolerance are hard to piss off, and would never say "love and tolerate"
04I mean hell
seldom say it, not never
rain. rule 14. k, thx
04If you've been in the fandom as long as I have you begin to see that bronies stuff it down each other's mouths
/me goes to play touhou
04LOVE AND TOLERANCE LOVE AND TOLERANCE
what Ghosties said
rule 14? do refresh my memory as to what that is
04It was never even meant to be used like how must bronies these days use it ._.
^
Ghosties: Thats why my friend hates bronies :P
^
Ghosties: But not me :$
04It was originally meant to be a counter trolling mechanism
thats why I hate bronies
hate bronies...
/me looks at channel name
herp
/me grabs popcorn to watch the chat show
04You can be a fan of the show and dislike other bronies
I happen to have good friends here, Carpathia[uderp]
how is it used today Ghosties the only bronies i talk to are here
I like the show, and I like a few of the people here
I will love and tolerate everyone, except for the few, very very few exceptions. =3
doesnt mean I like the rest of the fandom
04Oh Vordox
dang this is some great entertainment here! XD
which are Vordox
04In any case, "love and tolerance" is used like a mantra now
Only one person has made me so mad and disgusted that I avoid and completely forget them.
who was it Vordox
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tkQfxESnP1U/TtLQuV19nOI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/h1R4UVplqro/s1600/290-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic.png
xD
alexxm: None you should know.
12I never said you said there was anything wrong with it
ok Vordox
nobody has managed that for me yet, but I do have to laugh at my dad for how homophobic he is
/me 12suddenly has toast
man I have never ever lived by those standards, mainly due to the fact its beyond human capabilities
04NS
I'm not using it as a mantra, I'm using it as an ideal.
it's
JUST LIK EJESUS
04it's been over 600 days since you last logged on
JESUS*
04now brb shower
:D
04But when does an ideal become trite
04When does it become mundane
04Something that people say to be accepted
memetic mutation
Ghosties why do you use red in every message?
04I'm a mod :P
when people stop being tolerant and start saying tolerate?
mods type in color here.
because he's is god
i noticed...
but why lol
it has?
darnit
amazing
Ghosties: It's where people abuse it's right.
Simple
stupid english language
09green is my fave colour
04Because I chose red initially when I came here and it just stuck
Lawl
04Dat autokick
04He hasn't returned
lolol
04Interdad
ride of the valkyries time?
04WAGNER, HELL YES
high five!
anyway, tolerance is not something you just pick up by watching a show.
/me sends a virtual high five
damn right
XD
04Listen I have no problem if you picked up how to be a better person by the show
^
04My problem is when said person flaunts it
I'm not a brony, so I don't know :P
that isnt being a better person
04When you force it onto others
man what's up with me tonight?...
thats getting big headed
Just as I put Jesus as an ideal for myself, not the religion.
Am I on a sugar high?
possibly dshannon have some beer
12whoa
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/140/531/5880f256df28799b1cb838d25fbf2830-d3ivn99.png?1318992465
man its been a while since I've had one of those XD
Ghosties: indeed.
thegt90 well he's fucked
04I don't think he's coming back >_>
12When i stood up my whole leg prickled x_x
"Having a religion is like having a penis. Its fine to have one, and its fine to be proud of it. Just dont try to ram it down my child's throat"
Ghosties: It's cause of that you bronies have succeed to get spread so fast.
best quote ever
dat luna(r) astronaut
... dat mental image
i find it funny cus its dash goin through the earth
04If you had called me a brony a couple months ago I would have fervently denied it
Rain: :D exactly
mfw I actually thought that green guy was DCD.
also, Good morning~
holy @#%$
Have I really been a brony for 7 months?!
wtf
hey Starflash how syour day been
Ghosties, I would have and still do respond with a shrug and "yeah, but dont accociate me with them"
confounded ponies, they drive me to spend time on the internets.
Same here Rain

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YBs3I8kDuw

12I do get easily distracted when I'm near multiple mirrors at different angles
04well so are you
/me eats dshannon's face
No chat will die

04just make a macro or something like Xeli said
Drunk is best way. :D
why not whats the worst that could happen
.....I still don't think so.
04I might ask him about that next time he's on
04and that invisible unicode or w/e
oh lol those
well, I'm wiped. Gonna crash
Umm, suspension, expulsion, to name a few consequences.
Bye hen3ry!
bye hen3ry
GilDash|EqD: Gildy!
it's based off
adios, viya con carne
TOM
04Because DrA refuses to allow the use of spaces in Dragon names
er
Irish_Pony: You took your damned time to notice. ;)
bye hen3ry
that unicode is uh
Irish_Pony: How's those reaction times? :D
!kyu
This is so weird, I have girl voice, but I am a bro, but I only use it for girly lyrics in songs.
ohwaitnot on
04derp
'
those
GilDash|EqD: Oh lets just me and CrazyCherry are..."Distracted" at the moment ;)

U+0020
CrazyCherry: ...
Like the high pitched songs.
just propose movie time , if your teachers arent total dicks , they will agree !
TheRainbowDash: I literally am incapable of high pitch. :D
GilDash|EqD: Well she went AFK for a moment :P
04erm
04what
Tom is best pony you guys.
Irish_Pony: ... And why have I not been invited? :(
GilDash|EqD: Yeah, singing Equestrian Girls, and wow, I can somehow, somhow, hit those notes.:D
04NS when I said I was going to ask him I also meant I was going to ask him what it is
hey DuskStarshimmer hows your day been
TheRainbowDash: I have to sing it an entire octave lower. :D
alexxm, Well I need to sleep, that has been my whole day
Yeah, like my vice clears up more, and then, a girl voice comes out.
Ah
...somehow, I manage to pull this off.
/me passes out
well a macro is just a repeater sort of thing
*voice
GilDash|EqD: Oh come one were almost to the good part...here *pushes alexxm over to her* take him and do something with him
it's a set of instructions
that gets repeated
go google it
*on
wait what Irish_Pony
04I sorta/kinda already knew what a macro is, but thanks.
and what I pasted there was the space unicode thingy
04well let's see if it works
Irish_Pony: But I've misses CrazyCherry for so long... :(
GilDash|EqD: Yeah, I can sing that also. ...from metal to....modern pop girl music.:D
04if not, 3 dragon coins agone!
Or dance music, whatever.
TheRainbowDash: Nope. Metal or rock for me. :D
04GODDAMNIT
GilDash|EqD: We'll figure something out ;)
/me hugs GilDash|WqD
TheRainbowDash: Anyone can sing dance though. Just need autotunes. :D
GilDash|EqD: No, just explaining the eifferences in genres....in which I can sing.
/me hugs GilDash|EqD
/me hugs alexxm.
o-O?
GilDash|EqD: Like the Equestrian Girls song? Eh...
noooooo all my dragcave dragons got unnamed
and I should
really do my work
fml
04go do eet
TheRainbowDash: Well, I can try to sing to almost anything, it just ends up sounding metal. :D Like This Day Aria... sounds really weird when I sing it. :D
Like I can hit that super high note that Twilight sings in the song Winter Wrap Up also.
:)
GilDash|EqD: Ah, Thsi Day Aria, I can sing, somehow, somehow, good....
TheRainbowDash: I can sing Winter Wrap up an entire octave lower and hit the low notes... That's the only way to hit that Twilight note without my voice fucking up. :D
Hahaha, sucks for you.:D
04NS your entire TST profile can be summed up as "I hate you, don't annoy me, and I might hate you less."
GilDash|EqD: GilDy!!! Oh I missed you so much!!!
GilDash|EqD: Guess whos back....
/me hugs GilDash|EqD tightly.
CrazyCherry: You left me waiting... :'(
that's cus it's what it is
13> tsundere
Like I can the colt and mare (original) version of This Day Aria...quite well.
04ohlol
GilDash|EqD: I'm so sorry I did that... I really am! :'(
TheRainbowDash: My voice is crap. Usually I can hit the notes, but my voice always sounds terrible anyway. :D
http://www.lugia.us/forum/community-hangout/tst-members-you%27d-like-to-meet-someday/msg294565/#msg294565

CrazyCherry: I was waiting all Monday for you... :'(
GilDash|EqD: I'm sososososososososososososoosososososoosososo sorry...

CrazyCherry: Are you going to make it up to me? ;)
Oh god....
I know where this is going.
I like where this is going :$
GilDash|EqD: Yes, anything you want, just tell me.
04goddamnit they got rid of the Tsundere t-shirt
TheRainbowDash, Irish_Pony: I started talking. It was only ever going to go one way. :D
04http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1525
GilDash|EqD: Yeah...that direction.:D
Typical.
04NS should wear the t-shirt in the last panel
CrazyCherry: I think you know full well what I'd like... ;)
GilDash|EqD, CrazyCherry Oi! Dont go and leave me now!

alexxm: I have been here all day.
alexxm: so good.
Irish_Pony: Tsk, who says we're leaving you? ;)
/me hugs CrazyCherry
Ok now I really like where this is going.......
hurr
/me hugs alexxm back.
Uh-oh...that awkward when GilDash|EqD and CrazyCherry and talking like thui-oh wait, just typical talk between the two.:D
13Well, i-it's not like she l-likes that shirt or anything...
13<<
13>>
04XD
04I think NS lacks the "dere" part of Tsundere
TheRainbowDash: If I'm talking it's nearly always awkward, if not for the person I'm talking to then everypony else on the chat. :D
Raise your hand if you dislike the newer generations of pokemon and only like the first or second generation
I see....
13Apparently I'm one too, except more on the dere side
13.w.
Rain: I concur.
then you sir, are not a pokemon fan
What?
04No, no, pretty sure you're a yande- OH MY GOD WHY DO I KNOW THIS
Rain: I hate pokemon altogether :P
you are only a fan of the first and second gen pokemon
13:3c
true fans like all gens of pokemon
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VovLJcaKMYE AJ<3
Ohyeah, because that was way more memorable in my childhood than of this, newer generation stuff.
Rain: I don't have a particularly favourite generation as much as favourite pokÃ©mon from each.
cus' Drake knows these things for a living
13I love you all so much and if anyone does anything to hurt you I'll cut them up and feed their limbs to you <3
also I've grown into a sarcasm incarnate I swear
04NS I said that last night
Drake the Hensh is rubbing off on me more than I thought
):
04stop stealing my lines :(
you did?
I wasn't reading
TheRainbowDash: It's based from None Piece 4
the newer generation pokemon is the same stuff that you grew up with. the only difference is you
you grew up
12O_o
Vordox: Oh, derp....
and it is now childish to you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ipMagcF26fM#t=267s TheRainbowDash
but yes
13Raw D:

13she needs cooking first
/me puts her remains in the oven
04We noticed S
04NS
Nyx and I make shots at each other all the time
especially in the presence of Hensh
we even make sarcastic shots at him
13why do people I don't remember talking to keep finding their way to my buddies list
04XD
I'm gonna leave you now, Have to do some work, see you again when movie night starts. I'm gonna leave you with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF-eVnqq-bw&feature=related
04That's why I don't accept random buddy requests from weird people
13I don't accept random requests either LOL
13but somehow I have people in this list who I don't recognise/remember
04hmm
04maybe I should clean up mine
13If you remove me from that list I'll rip your throat out and feed it to the dogs <3
13I mean
13hi
Bye Lil_B!
hurr Drake
I replied to your LPW post
GilDash|EqD: Ah, my voice cracks up on the super high notes, but that's okay by me.:D
04is it one of those sarcastic "lol overused memes" posts?
And it's not clear enough/
04Oh wait
yep
04that "sarcastic" adjective was redundant
well
/me runs
I replied with the same meme
TheRainbowDash: That's why I sing on octave lower then most. I can get super low notes that make people go, "Whoa..."
/me is gonna stay loggin in the chat, becaus I have to keep the PX Running anyways, but I'm gone now~~~
04NS I barely ever use mems, and if I do they're always reaction images

Bye Vordox!
Vordox: Awww yeah.:)
Drake, I only have that pic cus' MLP fans rage at it for some reason I can't fathom
I got banned off a network for posting it in a MLP channel

Let me explain something. Using the Dead Island theme song is cheating cause that song makes ANYTHING sad.
hey |Discord| hows your day been
Cheating?
dat dead island music :'(
alexxm: I just woke up but it has been good so far
Tat was on of the best games ever
i still havent beat dead island :$
BAKA O_O
Any sad music for me is undermined if the game it comes from is terrible :D
http://fav.me/d4miwh7 MadSurge, not a game, but just beautiful.

Mother 3 was a pretty depressing game. :P
wops o3o
My little dashie was the only book that EVA made me cry. EVA
Spell-of-Gaming: I heard. I might play it some time.
http://fav.me/d4vfvcr I would freak out if I saw Dashie in my bed.o_o

|Discord|: >book
but yeah
i cried a little too
how come TheRainbowDash
alexxm: Shw always got that, look of hers.
I may be the only guy in the universe that thought Mother 3's story was terrible -__-
lol
MadSurge: May you explain? :P
MadSurge haven't played it so i can't say
never played mother 3 6_9
http://fav.me/d4yvet6 Best gift ever, ship that to me, now.:D
TheRainbowDash: SOOOOOCKKS http://derpy.me/MLpNf
Mother 3? Never heard of it.
XAX: Rainbow socks now, amazing.
TheRainbowDash she looks pissed
alexxm: Yeah, that's the problem.
TheRainbowDash: I legitimately want a pair of rainbow socks. That would be amazing.
wb Drake

Spell-of-Gaming: I'm not against character deaths, but it happens so early you don't feel anything for those blank characters :/

D:
TheRainbowDash: I can't put up a pony background until my parents know I am a brony.
Spell-of-Gaming: exactly. Same for the brother. At least it was a pretty good RPG.
|Discord|: They don't know yet? How long have you been a brony?
TheRainbowDash: A month or two
i watch MLP on my tv no one cares :)
LightTrooper105: I actually decided to look at the Torchlight II store page today, and i saw that this one is gonna be multiplayer :o We should play a little when it comes out.
Tanetane Island on Mother 3 was one hell of a drug.
|Discord|: Ah, okay. I've been a brony for almost 3 months now, and they knew at around 1 week into my introduction to the fandom.
i use youtube and bronystate to watch ponies
XAX indeed back to cooking!
im a closet brony -.-
TheRainbowDash: ever heard of Earthbound? Mother 3 is the japan only sequel.
Oni_Link come out
TheRainbowDash: I am a master of hiding things. It is to be the "other" things I was afraid my mom would find but now it is justy ponies so I don't care.
MadSurge: ...never heard of Earth Bound either.
I never admit it to people that i'm a brony, but I never deny it when asked.
im scared...
If someone asks, i say yes.
still need to finish downloading the rest of season 2 0-0
|Discord|: Okay then, whatever you want to do, fine by me.
TheRainbowDash ness from smash bros is from earthbound
EarthBound...ma gawd talk about a fucked up game with some crazy bosses
alexxm: Really? Never knew that.
TheRainbowDash: it's a pretty whacky RPG for the SNES
I can't say no if someone asks if i'm a brony anyway. I have Pinkie clipped to my school bag, and i wear Rainbow Dash headphones pretty much wherever i go :l
Ah, out of my generation league, wasn't born into the SNES age.
MadSurge: Especially that one boss...what was his name, the one at the end?
Gyigas
i don't really do anything to say this guy is a brony in public
hello
MadSurge: Yup
XAX: where you get those RD headphones?
hey pipsqueakthepirate hows your day been
If Mother 3 was a fanfic, it would have made it deeper in to the "Slice Of Life" Genre.
pipsqueakthepirate: Hai
http://fav.me/d4nuzgq Again, would freak out.
ust woke up:P
MadSurge: I heard the bossfight with Giygas is... interesting.
XAX: I have only a SHED.MOV shirt, and I like trolling people to guess what it's from :D
what does the shirt say MadSurge
XAX: it's very mind screw like.
alexxm: it's decorative toaster cozy Derpy with "hey hey hey, stay outta my shed" written around it
right thanks MadSurge
http://fav.me/d4o0dlg Hahaha, Dashie, why you jealoud?:D
*jealous
I did change the picture in them though (the background behind RD's cutie mark is RD's coat color instead of black now."
The "crush kill destroy swag" shirt is pretty good too :$
XAX: they make headphones 20% cooler
NINJAZZ
WELCOME BACK BRAH
I wonder if Earthbound 64 was any deeper in the development stage... There's a picture where a Pigmask hangs himself. I kinda found that disturbing.
Here's a very important life lesson. Wash your dishes BEFORE they smell like spoiled milk.
Hey XAX!
/me hugs XAX
hey Ninjazz hows your day been
TheRainbowDash: RD+Soarin' is canon for me :D
/me hugs Ninjazz
Good so far, alexxm.

MadSurge: Yeah, but look at the pony internet again about Dashie shipping, and report back to me of your findings.:D
35 minutes into chapter 5, XAX. So far so good.
Ninjazz: :D
Ninjazz: Dishes dirty? To the... dishwasher. :D

Just get inspiration from a QR code to make a maze. :P
How you been?
GilDash: I know what this calls for....wubwubwub.
TheRainbowDash wait someone made a sequal to my little dashie
Am I the only one who wasn't old enough to watch Saint Seiya/ Knights of the Zodiac and enjoy it wayyy later on in their life?
TheRainbowDash: I prefer mosh, mosh, mosh. :D
04Espeon~
TheRainbowDash: not a chance, I'm against pony shipping :D
/me just hugs
GilDash: Nope, Dubstep Wubwasher.:D

Ninjazz: You're missing out on so much. :D
Hey GilDash!
Damn fingers... Work properly DAMMUT.

GilDash: I know... :(
MadSurge: Holla! :)

TheRainbowDash: I'm just not fond of crack pairing :P
TheRainbowDash wait someone made a sequal to my little dashie

alexxm: I would execpt someonw did that already, and MadSurge, oh....
Sign of a true wimp, someone who talks shit on the internet but would never say it to your face in the real world.
MadSurge: Ugh found FlutterDash stuff.:D
Ninjazz: As far as my reading goes, or the writing of the story?
XAX: Reading, good. Chapter, exceptional.
TheRainbowDash: *pomf*? :D

Oh God...

Anypony here want to play Diablo 3 with me?

Right?
Ninjazz: Oh yeah, okay.

Ninjazz: Well that is different
HON
Eh.
Read my bio.
The element of laughter
I can't focus on reading chat, listening to chapter reading, and rubbing my damn hands together.
And typing.
Why are you rubbing your hooves together?
TheRainbowDash: Didn't wear gloves when washing dishes. They can't work properly now, since I cab barely feel them.
Ah, got to wear gloves.
Eyup.

So, what has been going on?
this chat needs moar Saint Seiya
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=Br5HLUbA8Gg
I see...
For MLD, "Be careful who you fall in love with cause someone, somewhere WILL NOT APPROVE."Sounds like MLD right?

Oh, btw, I'm doing okay Ninjazz.
Good to hear, Twi_Fi. :)
Can Scootaloo get some character development? ANY?
Yeah, the 4chan links are hit or miss whenever I click them.
but... she really likes your mane D:
HOW ABOUT... This one. http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1338614167454.png
Or can we get a spinoff all about Sweetie Belle?

TheRainbowDash: Grace is a good quality to have, Dashie. :|

O_O
and very sad
04Yes you have
04And I agree
Ninjazz: Oh, she has, has she? ;)
Yeah, nything.
*anything
it's wonderfully written
GilDash: Yes... :$
04That one where Robin goes megalomaniac?
Yeah
GilDash: I am the worst of you all.:D
and Slade is the hero for once
04ayup
04I loved that one
it's twisted
since it's pretty much the reverse of the actual happenings
TheRainbowDash: Debatable. :p
but... it's amazing
http://i.imgur.com/3tYEp.png
What?
I canceled the RP because I was going to get banned, and then you took over, so....

04Heya Sky
valoreins: Going good, and you?
does the emotional stuff
really well
GilDash: Well... Have full with that. :$
Renard: WTF!
04I agree
it's hard to get all the emotional stuff to add up, like trauma
04I thoroughly enjoyed it
I think trauma is one of the hardest things to write
04Even though it made me baaaaw
since you have to thoroughly understand it
to show the "progress" and everything
yeah
Twi_Fi: My reaction also.
I love that story
Fuck, Renard... It's becoming a god damn meme...
frustrated,,, i can't watch the movie stream because my brothers used the internet all day long
Hello valoreins
10hi
Does that mean you are missing the incredible stream we are having right now, valoreins ?
hey guys
hours ago..
Twi_Fi: I fell for that.:D
Ninjazz: I might have to punish you too. ;)
bored today
04wait

GilDash: I deserve one also, well, just because.
04I eas meant to cut the line into sections
04crap

So many ponies to punish, so little time... ;)
What are we talkin' about?
GilDash: Me first.

04oh well I'll do that later in photoshop
04It's been so long since I've done something serious with spriting
what I miss?
:$
umm.. will you punish me bcause i missed the movie stream..?
Run, LightTrooper105lMP3.

LightTrooper105lMP3: Nah, stay here.

LightTrooper105lMP3: You'll be alright. I'll take care of you. :)
I like crumpets
I really liek Rarity. :3c

Ninjazz: I wub Rainbow Dash a hayload.

valoreins : Come to guam there is alot of potatoes here

TheRainbowDash: How would you measure a hayload?
Ninjazz: Just meaning, a lot.
Do I have to say who my favorite pony is?

04wat

Twi_Fi: Is it...Spitfire?
No, I didn't watch it and I won't.
TheRainbowDash: nooooooooo
TheRainbowDash: Spitfire... That has reminded me something.
heh
also Drake
let's persuade the mods to stream the new carebears
I hate it when authors delete their fics ):
04worse that The Peace Contract
NOOOOOOO
04than*
why not ninjazz? could turn out to be like mlp if its acually good
Ninjazz: Spitfire reminds me of something too. ;)
I've had 2-3 fics that I loved that author's have deleted
;_;
just so we could have more eyesore here
But MLP went through so much to be the sensation it is today
Back from eating noms
You might like this one too, GilDash. Maybe. :$
did nopony actually watch it?
04I hate it when they don't finish the fic near the climax
04*coughTeamRocketNeocough*
You can't just try to make something like that easily
that too
I tend to stay away from shows intended for children.
nope, bcause i dont have hub channel in my place
I hate car bears

TheRainbowDash: They are secret, but are they fun?
GilDash: Indeed. I've seen her throw a few my way sometimes. :|
Twi_Fi: Eeyup, more than just fun.
Ninjazz: What?! There is no such thing as too much!

Ninjazz: I'm a very good listener.... ;)
There's these people I have to sit next to. I don't talk to them, ever. I silently watch their lives, how they think, how they react, I know everything about them and they don't even talk to me. :$
04NS
Twi_Fi: Famine? o.o
04Other than wind
GilDash: I like talking too. :$
04what "element" do you associate with the sky?
BUT! I can't cause a cat has my tounge.

Ninjazz: Confuzzled? ;)
They land on everypony's roof as if they own them.
Ah, I see...
GilDash: Yes. That will do. :$
Definitely a GilDash x Ninjazz shipping going on.:D
Airpuff: Who said anything about targets? I paint in broad strokes. :)
It's rude!
/me coughs nervously
TheRainbowDash: After seeing 4000000 Pegasi OC and only 2 Earth...ya it can get annoying....
Ninjazz: It's okay to be a little confuzzled sometimes. ;)
uh Drake
GilDash: ahaha broad strokes, thats one way to say it :P
GilDash: Only when you're around... :$
what would you have me associate with it?
Irish_Pony: Ah, the representation of each clan of ponies is so unbalanced.
Ninjazz: is she throwing you into discombobulution? xD
I need to draw something any suggestions?
04Why do you think I'm asking
ponies
Airpuff: Discombobulation*
04The first thought is lightning but I'd like some other options
valoreins: but who?
