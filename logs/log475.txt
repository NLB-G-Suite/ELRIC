Crazy Asian Kid
his reviews aren't even considered reviews, it's just him making fun of the movie's stupidity and writing a script for it
Supporting cast? In Karate Kid?
He gives honest opinions at the very end of his reviews.
HANG YO COAT
sorry not rant, but is he comparing them?
they are very different
Doug's review of Breaking Dawn was a rant.

why should i tolerate an asshole?
as in you went out the window?
<---
uderp

I only expressed my opinion
04Because then you can't "love and tolerate" if you're not willing to do it all the time
seldom say it, not never
rain. rule 14. k, thx
/me goes to play touhou

/me looks at channel name
I like the show, and I like a few of the people here

xD
12I never said you said there was anything wrong with it
/me 12suddenly has toast
04NS
I'm not using it as a mantra, I'm using it as an ideal.
it's
JUST LIK EJESUS
JESUS*
04now brb shower
:D
04But when does an ideal become trite
04When does it become mundane
04Something that people say to be accepted
memetic mutation
04I'm a mod :P
when people stop being tolerant and start saying tolerate?
mods type in color here.
i noticed...
but why lol
