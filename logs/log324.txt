the
everything betwene 'clint eastwood' and 'limbiz' showd up on my screen at the same time

It is! It's a good throwback. I think it's been a little overhyped by the entertainment media, but it's good fun
that and the spinoff with puppysmiles =D
for me?
With a few exceptions in some scenes
Considering the crap that hollywood puts out today....
:)

I really liked it
Alright alright Ill add you :)
hmmmm
One-nighters once in a while is tolerable for most ppl, but if you must do it consistently for, months with 4-5 hours of sleep when you dont do an all nighter tend to mess people up.
:3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYPG1wAlssQ&feature=youtu.be This is the only finished ponysong I've uploaded-
and yeah, I havent been able to sleep lately,

Oh my... I did that pony personality thing, it looked like a friggin arrow head. 99% aimed at Twilight, with a thin shaft pointing down to fluttershy... :$ :(
hm, I'll work on the mix, sadly I'm limited to mono speakers atm
which americans assure me is apple juice
a few months agp
i still think they making alchohol

No... I don't think the channel is 24hrs
ARE YOU DUMB Yes/No. No. YOU ARE NOT TWILIGHT
I probably should have made the horizon more defined

and all you had to say was "daft punk" and he understood completely
Because there's nothing streaming
lol
Oh.
Skip it
I haven't been keeping up with much besides Antipodes now that I'm done with FoE. Any good suggestions?

Silly philly
It is a horrible thing

LOADING SCREEN 2: the longest buffer
yesh
sigh
it would be inffluenced to much by the fans
Cheers for the info :D
i like cheerios
but since it's on the hub, not many people see it because the hub is not in as many as nick or cartoon network
There we go
I might watch a Harry Potter movie, or even possible play some SIMS, but thats unlikely
My aunt bought it for my cousin
I really want it to be on a different channel
with plenty of sugar
However most people that were like me would skateboard all day and shit
cousin rejected it
Send them to me
yeah, there are some fans I dont even want to be reconised by the creators
Yeah, it's not broadcast in England at all D:
never had them
and now I must finish it
cuz honestly I dont watch any of the other shows on the channel
too much consistency in cherrios
hmm yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkEsOu8DFmE fluttershy singing <3
I live in a rural area

just as long as we continue to prove we are here to stay
Hello :3
If only i was in usa would roadtrip for that not a second to lose
and as such most kids around me listened to country

talking about the future of poneis
Ahh, but it's not a stream yet, is it
GOOD NAP TO YOU ALL
hmm

Staring at the countdown
I'm gonna cry
I HAVE DONE IT!!!

Waiting
For that moment

Okay
I guess up until season 5
Do you have any games on the account?
*points at broniesftw* OBJECTION!
Well everyone has TF2
has anyone revealed their name before in here?
I'm in Australia and it's currently 5 to 11 at night. I don't think I'd have much of a tomorrow if I watched it live
Assuming it's installed
we had a stream 3 hours ago..but then something happened
Hm... based on the current situation it's about 5 seasons
seriously wtf...hasbro
i dunno
I'd be up for atacking a tf2 server
I meant have they bought any
lol well there is a sever i have in my list that is empty
like libunao
I know
best breakfast is pancakes with egg and sausage
Lewis Carlin, there you g

I got a gift for you for showing me that song
LOL
i would play terraria but it is not compatble with mac

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viTkj0eu-fk

sooo... when does the stream usualy starts ?
last night
Somehow I doubt it, as much as I wish it'd happen.
how can I create my own room
Probably
which would consist of..
anyone knows?
*looks in wallet*
more people come here eventually

A ripped 5 dollar bill...

Well it's exactly the same name I picked here :D
well honestly
You click the #bronystate at the bottom
You can?
yes
Huh
thaat sucked
Yep
ehhhh
although must admit, it does look a lot like the real thing
Not that I actually would in all likelyhood
that was bad
buahaha
when i go to the other theaters they tend not to run all the awesome videos this one does
damn
yep
eh
I LOVED that sound
yeah it does
I was born in 1995...so...yeah...
hehehe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0
The dialup sound I recognize though.
uh oh, they aren't replaying the episode again at 10:30 this week.
problem is that when the episode starts
yeaa
yeah i got a g3 episode one time
This is my first time in the Twilight Theatre
if any of you are playing MC you should join my server
I probably wouldn't eiter, unless my friends were on and I would have liked to talk to them
it always crashes and i never know why
althoug there was this ONE time when they put the G3.5 series :D
Cheers
They're doing "Return of Harmony"
Dammit
:P
on the ither channels
t was :D
ocarina of time
hehehe
I feel slightly less noobish now:)
Damn you brain! stop making me have nostalgis!
I usually go to the theatre of whoever is this week's pony
Anyway, where's fluttershy?
was tis agonizing
I grew up wihtout consoles
http://babylondonstar.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4h04jk
But decided to change it up today
WAAA?
I only found all this out last week XD
she's in the middle of making derpy I thikn
randomly go to any channel
Ocarina of Time, hells yes.
I grew up with N64 and gamecube
IKR
lol
:3
and there was like 5 k more on there than at any other time last week
When Derpy spoke, you could only see one thing:
best
Also, just found out when I did that that smileys auto-changed to ponies
DEPY!
the streaming is not working
Of course they do, though
wow dude. thank you
I grew up with the Dreamcast and PS1, but we had a N64 with a few games.
hehe
anyway...
i know which is sad
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tajDxBaPBBM&feature=related
I wish i had that kind of money
Enjoy it.
3d mase
how come they cant find a way to mass produce merch like that?
!
*of
stream isn't working
I wish I just had the damn plushie
that was awesome
the creators played her as the straight man character
it wont work
^3^/)
and those tend not to stick with audiences well
:D:(;)
mhmm
hiya rainbow dashin
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=T260UBgmxKg
:P
:O
ME TOO T_T
yer
\)^.^
fail
Actually
cuz it would be too expensive
:O
I saw that one too<3:S
even if they did mass produce it
which they could
anybody here write fanfiction?
more like she's more normal than the rest of them
<3
tbh
i like her
Thats all I know
....
I find it endearing in way. I definitely prefer it to Pinkie, who's a little too spastic for me.
yes...
6_9
it would cost like 50 dollars orsomething, and parents aren't spending 50 dollars on a plushie
D:
i dont get why people need every character to have a episode
YOU MONSTER!
damnit, didn't work
I literally spent 2 years
watev i was born in 1997
I'm writing my first now
Player don`t work Wtf?
>:O
i prefer ones with them all in
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Py0DUvG7s&feature=related
that was my childhood
get everything to the highest
and then it died.
(6_9
It's just the trend that was set by previous episodes
oh, that's probably quicker
hey almsot everything comes from there now adays!
you need a balance
yer
Oops no bracket required :3
i cant decide
We
're nearly halfway into the season, give it time
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
well I seen people other crap for higher prices
i know and i know why they did it like that
Thats them all
PS1 I remember cause a friend had it
and we used to play MGS
ever since meatspin i dont trust random links :\
for now at least
if I click on the stream popout it's shown
lol
if you think about it, Rarity and Rainbow would cause the most conflict
pinkie pie is the best
Dont worry, non pg links get you kicked
but not this one :(
just because of their personalities
Lol, I remember the first time I found meatspin.
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
yes it is
We haven't seen her in a while
me too
It was terrifying.
fluttershy?
good song bad image
ugh why
well i am kinda glad they let her take a back seat for awhile
china*
Have some waiting music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoCjaC9Ro0c&feature=channel_video_title
Everything does come from countries that have cheap laybour.
it is supposed to be about the six not her
Bexause there's no stream
I don't mind the back seat
laybour ?
Garghragh
etc
i hate the public image
:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
quite a trap
The public image is mixed
times are changing bud
just as it should be
but you don't want her gone yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbLibnZzOI&feature=related
mixed?
honk honk blarg blarg
mixed
I just wish she'd get to stand in the actual background every once and a while
*slams head through desk*
aye
wall of pinkie pie!!!!!!
i dont know
we are neither heros, nor are we the devils minions
*slams head through floor*
chocolate sprouts
Blarg blarg honk?

I can speak alien!
honk
blarg
IKR
lo that would be awesome
I can't wait for the videos to start
>Inconsistent >Still get flamed.
I'm probably not making any sense
Fox news is shit
not it makes sense to focus on others to balance things out
Yeah, mine little pony
BLARG.
i've seen pics
:D
now it makes*
I wish that were possible.
I've used it
chocolate sprouts, some get chocolate others scream and shout
it would be aweesome If i got turned into a pony on the way
did fluttershy get an episode yet
FOX is
i could watch it on cable but dont feel like it
they just horrbly misunderstand the subject
not really
honk blarg blarg honk honk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeMCXKSk5c&feature=related
brace yourselves applejack being ignored again is coming
IT'S PONY DAY
Unfortuneately it makes you look retarded to other players
*it
Most of all we are looked at as a trend
lol O meant FOX is a comedy I think
exactly
just a trend guys
I just cant stand some american news places, it just doesnt feel like their just giving you the news
how dare you call fox news? I got family that is news and you insulted them all !
noooooooooooo
People hate fox news because they use the term "Fair and Balanced" when they're rightwing nutballs
:D
attacked slandered w/e
gotta get down on pony day
Those are raw sprouts too.
I do too but if i were to go to equestia--as a huuman?
Well, technically last week she had too much attention
Fuck fingers
Applejack makes me thirsty
I seriously had my jaw drop when that happened
It wouldnt turn out well
mmhmm
Fox news is just trying to appeal to a mass audience
speak for yourself iam halfway between crazy and
Sure it would. Just find Fluttershy and she'll take care of you :D
I can't watch ponies on tv at all here :(
her spotlight did get taken by derpy
ToRs down?
well the thing is
hehehe
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why are they running the episodes together though?
i can only watch reruns
I helped make apple cider once! hard work, but deliciouser than you could imagine...
Of all the worst things that could've happened
This is
THE
WORST
i talk to meself
POSSIBLE
yeah
I can catch them if i wake up early for school
lol
THING!
lol because fluttershy is best poy
But only re runs
he did the research into the names of the ponies
yeaah-
wow, there are alot of join/part messages
Hi!!
pony
I talk to my other selfs all the time
Fluttershy is definitely best pony.
yeah, everyone is crazy
Yeah, I'm not too fond of that choice either
and iam everyone of you
3 hours everypony
Matter of how crazy.
WHY MEEEEEE? WHYYYY?
lol
I like "batshit" as a measure.
Hmm

I've been here for an hour then :D

Anyone?
I never played that actually. I played the first though.
6_9
OMG
/join #BattlelogBronies

Though, now that I think about it, it may have to do with the episodes themselves
crusaders just finished for me, have some more music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voj9MhBUaTI
THE KEY BLADE
We

loving this atm
I KNOW THIS
oops
I can't laugh without launching into diabolica laughter
No
it shouldn't be "insane" or crazy to like show
No they don't
only because i immagined it to be !
They do to some extent
i dont have imagination
Sephiroph. That is all.
No inq, there's not
Even though they're branded as -insert character- episodes
i think i still have it
neither can i
Only if they're too far in they don't realise it, then, they don't
they said it was hectic and it might be easier to focus on a character at a time
Sorry about that
lol k thx
*High five*
They don't always focus on that character
:D
:(
We could take over the world together!
Then again, not all alcoholics admit to being alcoholic. (Not comparing)
:O
as much as the description implies, that is
hmm
:)
my eyes!
but yeah... No ponies for me unless i wake up at around 6 - 6:30

Not very much though
:O

:P
:3
:D
I dunno why, but I never really liked it.
moring pony :D
:/
:)
or at least a suburban area where there wouldn;t be much resistance. We could take over that.
It's 11pm here
mornin!
One episode looked at Rainbow Dash and her ego, for example
Well no ponies for me unless, wait I'm in England... 3 pm ponies suckas!
:3
Mornan'
Heya
I mean, there are >some< values that are universal
hey :)
We dont celebrate halloween here-
even though its 2 pm here
are there no heterosexuals in equestira
I;ve got the laugh
can't argue with that
Organization 13! WOO! :D
or well, not when I was in my teens
and then the following episode was more about Tank
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwiv_Bt3-c&list=PL135BC4EC53F0CEA5&index=1&feature=plpp_video this is one of my fav pony songs
Its slowly becmoing popular now
rarity is hetero right?
Hiya
even though Rainbow held a key role
Can't believe I wasn't here when derpy talked
Great... now I have becoming popular stuck in my head...
Shame :/
do you think that'll be in the episode where someone doesn't like Pinkie?
no heterosexuals in equestria?
Derpy has the same VA as Rarity...
same
Is it just me, or is something being streamed that i cant see?
stick you might want to take it easy then
My intial reaction was O.o
just you
ture
noo its off
:P
Nothing's being streamed.
*RAGE*
does anyone know where the option to remove join/part messages is in xchat?
^

We kept our hoovsies warm at home

I kinda want to read fanfics but I know I just suck at reading
Don't even mention that browser.
YEEEESSSSSS

That's weird
it's nonsense.
The best fanfics are the ones about BG ponies
suck at reading? you just read this!
pay it no mind.
Awesome
My imagination is really crazy, yet bad 6_9
Ahh.. that was another part of my childhood ;p
silly humans
is the screen for the stream meant to be just loading
because BG ponies have a clean slate

I'm a cynical optomist
but poor Twist :(
no, no she didn't
if I wanna play an FPS, it's Quake.
i am going to fucking make it
yes
'cause i found that disturbingly hilarious
through telekinesis
the 100% cleaner version
14 and a half actually...
hahahaha ^
Remember when I said that if something is good
the song is great
No
Gta 2 on PS1 or War of the mosters on PS2... good times.
and it someone perfects it
May I have a link?
"Just how in tarnation did you get out of that cage missy?"
the song is pretty cool
a computer
yup
probably.
is anyone seeing nothing?
Lol
I think you mean telepathy Dapper. Telekenesis wouldn't be very helpful
and my perfected, I mean created the dirtiest drop of all time
"
lol
:(
shit as in good sorry
Awkward silence XD
Oh
hehe. telekinesis...
It's another 2 hours yet
but the best of by the best isnt always the best

Heath Ledger died :(
Cool

Wait, there are 2 Xcom remakes WIP.
and you guys watch it and respond
Is anyone getting anything to show up on the stream?
This makes Fluttershy sad.
ponies tend to do that
using branches etc
the song is great
I can be an optimist and cynical
:(
good, make fluttershy sad
Keep up the optimistic work! :3
NO
she doesnt deserve happiness!
Oh? I didn't knw about the second one
look at the countdown
people keep calling me pinkie pie because of the way i act :$
Hi Guy's
but just listen to the drop
yeah-
weres dah music?
before you say that
;P
I'll brace myself xD
Then again... A pessimist to an optimist is a realist...
oh, I see
Can you believe this shit
Chat..going...so...fast....
Waiting...
fluttershy is best <3
I like to think I'm a realist
100% clean version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfNXme3vqs

dohoho

/me runs around in circles "she cant hit a moving target!"
pony gore is wrong

Hi all
pony gore is discusting and creepy :/
i mean all unicorns can use telekenesis right?
I watched the clean version (I can't watch the other) and it's hilarious.
and if we take the heart warming eve to be canon
if we're going for oxymorons...
I had a pleasant dream
but youre still making them...
Yes
i used to make arrow to the knee jokes...then i stfud.
excellent
http://puppytwister.com/
its not gore
/me takes a few steps shyly towards the corner.
I finished it ^_^
i think earth ponies have the power to break the forth wall more than any other race
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!
they can all use telekinesis because they had to unify their abilities to move the sun and moon
BANZAAAA
Um... If we're talking about fics and all...
I actually somehow managed to complete it
but all of them are awesome
It's time for everyponies favorite part of the brondcast, and I'm talkin' about RADIO GRAFITI!\
