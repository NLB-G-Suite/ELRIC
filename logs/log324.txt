Objection! pegasai are able to stand on clouds as though they are completely solid objects. However, pegasai are also able to pass through clouds without any trouble. I theorize that pegasai are secretly interdimensional beings of ancient origin

How do pegasi walk on clouds? answer:
ALIENS
im anti wub...
magic

Mods: When I use Safari as a browser, your 'cast hangs up on the 7-second mark in the "This ad will close in" countdown. The screen and the stream are visible behind that notice, but the "close" box never appears below it and the screen remains grayed out. The problem doesn't iccur with Mozilla Firefox.
i would kill a man if it opened a portal to equestra. Say I if you would do the same
that was deep
And your good to river..I mean strea,
OMG BLACK SCREEN
derpy_pony: those are just my results, though
SuperBrony64: did you take the pony personality test? which pony are you mostly like?
The more time this spends loading, the more I get to listen to the Psycho intro music.
todays ep dosn't sound to intresting, heres hopeing for another lesson zero
I
So it's all good.
umm...
not I
OH BOY A BUFFERING BAR
10,02Thank you for your patience, we will currently be back up in a matter of a few min. Thanks again for your continued patronage.

I've had the mlp fim intro on repeat for 2 weeks now
AND you got to be a pony
I don't know, I mean Dash learning about books?
CIRCLE
why would you kill a man who opened a portal to equestria?
or more Derpy!
That could be a lot of fun!
Simon: I got Rainbow Dash
THING
Opening portals to other dimensions would disturb the natural order...
Can someone record the stream coming in five hours?
no dude, this pic is all that is pony
Intermission: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtRBtIJULw
Phase4: lol Twilight Sparkle
The waiting has been doubled
thats next week
Somebody play some muzak
no the killing of the man is required to open it
lines that make a circle, bro
yay Intermission
no love for the mule, Phase4 ?
It is?
more AJ today
Then what's this week?
derpy_pony: aparently
Oooooh, really?
pfft fuck order i just want to....... pet the ponys
What's the plotline?
applecider
yes
Oh, right
pet..
all my rarity was dumped into twi
i refreshed so i wouldnt have to look at it anymore. i was getting a pony related boner, and that aint right.
I would not kill - because it's not what ponis teaching us
..... causeing both dimensions to collide, and therefore, be detroyed
OF COURSE IT IS RIGHT
http://imgur.com/Ba9dl what about you?
Well, it does involve 2 swidlin' brothers, right?
Aj bets the farm in a applecider contest
ow i get it. so you need to murder a man to open it, but murderes ant allowed inside
I could go for that
DUdE NO JUST NO
lol sonic x
:[
this is MY hypotheitcal situation
Dude im kidding
the dimensions would be fine
I'm recording it :)
ok then...
good.
Cool
Portal it is then :)
Good
^_^
yay`
quick, go to bed while the stream's down!
10 am on a saturday
Thats not right in any universe

I want to sleep

RONT HE MAGIC CAMEL FOR PRESIDET
Lool
I'm eating a whole lot of sugar so I can stay awake til live stream.
*walks off to kitchen*

I fear if I fall asleep I won't be up for the stream, but if I'm so tired...
im listening to it
worth it?
*whispers: one day*
he will return with knife
REFRESH
beware!
oh god he's geting a knife
Its only gonna be 2 pm where I live when it starts :D
why
I've been drinking Pepsi Max, which sucks.
But it has a bit of caffine in it.
I'd suggest a liter of V (2 pints)
lol meat tenderizer
this is going to end bad *grabs some popcorn*
OKIE DOKIE LOKIE ;3
OMG WTF
I suggest caffeine pills
nothing is streaming... leaving, will be back

clones can't be a slaves
;)
Lol
so
who wants cupcakes?
because it's like to slave another people
yea
and now I am on my last can of pepsi.
so real variant
/me may have been assuming V is a universal thing
ew wtf my ad has a dead baby
pepsi sucks
is to do a clone to save urself
no joke
from death
CHEERS
V is like Kick or Red bull I think
It's 5:00 AM here, and considering I was up at 6 yesterday for school, yeah I have been awake 24 hours... it's worth it for ponies tho, right?
H8ers gonna H8!
like in EVE
pinkie pie said okie dokie lokie, and i had previusly made a statement about pinkie pie
not the wost i had a vore pop up
making it funny
anything is worth it for the ponies

Pepsi max is better that regular pepsi imo, but coca-cola is the best.

"bubbles"
I mean they have to pay like 1 mil for every second of air time
!
oh I SEE!BMN STANDS FOR BRONY MOVIE NIGHT
HI
It's seeming like... something very sad is going to happen...
IS IT JUST ME AND YOU?
Ill have to put it on my to read list, I dont listen to readings that much
caps lock
i think
but i cant watch
Everyone is talking about "my little dashie" in the last days...they say it's sad too
: / ..... I'm feeling very anxious and sad
stupid law of my country
this goose is evil
it wont let me watch
hhhmmm....yeah. its over untill brony movie night starts
dang! the stream is broken!
I tries to read MLD but eh
ust not sleep...

I dont like humans in pony fics
I feel like I am missin out on something
mee too
I read my little dashie. It was sad, but it didn't get me tearing up

It's supposedly very good though, but wasnt my thing
this is my resault on the pony quiz http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/240/834/07c.jpg

Youu are pinkiedash!
it says i have the personality of pinkie pie
I'ma put my pjs on
Oh, while we're all gathered here, does anybody want to read a pony song parody I wrote?
I'm gonna play around on FL studios now...
it is certialy hard for a fanfic to get me teared up if I know it's supposed to have a reputation for being really sad in advance
I think, everyone who likes nightmaremoon, must read after that fateful night-
It's to the tune of Ice Cube's "Today's a Good Day"
...kinda was hoping it to be rainbowdash but w/e
oh yeah
this sucks
Fagot - he losed it already
I'd like some insite please. Thanks! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MExhbPgtICHV5Uz_BDrZtEY427pzOWLC1o_H35quzo8/edit

That cupcakes animation was pretty damn good I think
also, DAW YOU ARE FLUTTERSHY
But seriously if I could have voted in 2000 I would have gone with him :p
Why indeedy I am
Cupcakes isn't as bad as people make it out to be. I find it an okay read though
Hozaah?
i agree
have you read the story though? they left out most of the bad stuff in the animation.]
You know whats weird?
yes
This pmv is going to be harder then I thought too make -.-
'ornin' to the wonderful gents and m'ladies!
Election debates or news sometimes gets aired here
voting is for poor people
but i love how im not an Applejack and rainbow dash
basically theres team A and team B,

Aww, that fanfic is so sad. :3

No, but it sounds good!
massacre
gotcha
It was feutured on eh Fimfiction

I don't take pleasure, out of them...
it had potential- to be a avery good sadfic
I never actully read one of dem Fanfics
but?
dont know why
sweet apple masacre is so bad. rape, murder, fillies, colts knives, blood gore, violence rape, rape, rape
I just find them funny because it's so absurd.
but the suicide was so obvious-
dafuq?
EEEPIC PIE TIME
hm...
It kinda didnt make it as sad or as surprising
:P
but it is wellwritten-

I liked ringu alot, but its ages since ive seen it

it's gonna be 2am when the new episode begins

Somthing tells me that some people dont know the words to many of the songs (including me)

Just resonated with me better
I'll be awake.. :>
I saw Ringu 0 and The ring
Swell, but why is secunda in the background and who is luna hugging
Is there a stream going right now?
Ringu 0 is like the prequel

Which is funny because usually I like original movies over remakes
hey
yeah
what's the best way to learn DnD rules?
How many of you guys have already seen dis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENNSyy4u6M

http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=NzAyMnwxMzEyMzY
My screen is black
best part of the ring was when the girl came out fo the screen
Secunda? WTF? Its fan art requested by an author of a fic that I like.
Guess what this is from
Weird
Just that hypnosing buffering image..
I like horror movies where--you almost never see the monster, so much scarier

The whole point of writing sad stories, is that you need to make the audience care about the characters, in this it's already been done for you
cat?

The problem with all nighters is that you dont get to sleep for 36 hours and not 24, if you dont want to mess up your day/night cycle.
but everyone went crazy
and there was like five messages a second
or everypeople pony of pony watching people,
haha

I just spent about an hour trying to her Rarity's hair right on the toy...
I really liked it
Alright alright Ill add you :)
hmmmm
One-nighters once in a while is tolerable for most ppl, but if you must do it consistently for, months with 4-5 hours of sleep when you dont do an all nighter tend to mess people up.
did you try really small curlers?
yay
:3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYPG1wAlssQ&feature=youtu.be This is the only finished ponysong I've uploaded-

Next year we will have Derpy toys. It was in one of Nostradamus's predictions.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=-bNCfEvQFUY&feature=endscreen
I wish there was something to look at
/me is experimenting
AhHH
an AJ-centric episode would be kind of boring i think
runescape ._.
misclicked
I'm still awake!
What did you ask?
whats your rs name lol
yeah, I dont get why hasbro doesn't see US as a potential consumer...
Guess
So the stream is down? I thought my flash player is acting funny :D
Have you guys listened to this new song: Borgore - Flex (Dubstep Mix)?

I mean we are the ones with jobs, not little girls XD
rsmv2you
Ding ding ding :p

borgore*
Hasbro should make plushies
Every night i evetually find my way back to that song
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^!
they should
^
brb, breakfast time... hope there's no toast-juice :S
My house lacks plushies
well this is an AJish episode
vivix you might wanna work on balancing out the sounds on the spark song
there is an official video posted on ukfdubstep, but it got 18+ limitation later on
God I wish
yeah-
seems to get a bit clustered at around 2:00
link?
plz
but i doubt she'll do anything
so much dislikes, probably because the video suck'd, though the drop is sick
cept make cider
I need to take poop, But hallway at night is scawy..
Oh my... I did that pony personality thing, it looked like a friggin arrow head. 99% aimed at Twilight, with a thin shaft pointing down to fluttershy... :$ :(
hm, I'll work on the mix, sadly I'm limited to mono speakers atm
i love borgore
Someone bought a life size Rainbow Dash plushie from ebay
only pony related item I ever came close to buying on ebay was a miniature pluchie of derpy
a few months agp
i still think they making alchohol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9h5v5bTRIw
aaannnddd... Done.
that is exactly what I'm saying
So wait is there actually anything in the stream right now?
why not?
in addition to what it has now
is there any way to not be twilight in that thing
because twilight simply is best pony
finally done with this drawing
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkWCg3f0KWo&feature=g-all-u&context=G2c5ad15FAAAAAAAATAA
He has a point
whatche drawin?
This is my map http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/240777
Its not ponys but I like it :3 http://i.imgur.com/Q9Xic.png
actually, when horses eat apples it gives them the sensation of drunkenness...
No... I don't think the channel is 24hrs
indeed
Well it would be more money for them, so thats not the reason why they arent doing it.
ARE YOU DUMB Yes/No. No. YOU ARE NOT TWILIGHT
I don't think so True, I don't see nothin. I been watching it buffering for a bit.
I probably should have made the horizon more defined
Ah. KK I was just wondering whether I needed to use another browser or something.
It wont be on until the new episode
Ah nice
are you talking shit about twilight?
gah
two of our horses would drink beer
It's worth the wait.
Though I dont know what kind of merch could be more appealing to someone our age...
http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/?q=OTYwNnwxMzEyNjM you got NUTHIN' on me! :$
hmmm
but apple cider is like a spackling apple juice... very sweet and tangy
Bitch i'll break you
Well a little bit earlier than that.
okay
A spitfire lighter maybe?
?
PLUSHIES. That is all
*sparkling
nothing
have the toys with a little more attention to details?
i assumed so
A spitfire zippo whould be sweet
Something pony related:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBGA2pAkNTg
this is like the second or third most boring livestream I've ever watched
brb... must make hot pocket!
not as watered down as apple juice, and can have alcohol
never seen such a result before
... pony decals and stickers for an iphone or ipod?
is there a stream going on right now?
It reminds me ofe concept drawings in the colour
made with more spices
I don't even HAVE the video window loaded. I'm just chatting, adn Skyrimming.
i like that idea blue
Just wondering... do we all have the same ads?
wait for the part with the spinning helix, Block_Comment
like landscapes and--things in game plans
I saw pony shirts at hot topic
"You are today's iPad 2 winner!"
yer i'm gonna have breakfast soon
what about cases?
I don't get ads
So then... Good morning once again everyone!
cases also
morning
Look, here is a real youtube comment I just found: "im going﻿ to be on monkey dick porn hub program. move over you raging nipple shit. prepaer fur full extension my olympus dick. activate rainbow seman"
ya know stuff we'd actually buy
I want a pony iPhone case
good morning Ictiv
hmmm
See what I mean! I think the ONLY thing that put me into FLuttershy realm was that I mentioned I DO think it'd be cool to live in teh woods
Typical
pony iphone apps
not a fan of cases...
I simply like making it like that because there is no focus point
At the least a pony background
... ones that dont teach us how to spell but... other stuff XD
scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon and whatever else i have in the house
Hello everyone.
ah yeah
I think I actually saw mlp cases on a website one time
so you're eyes look around the picture
Pony poster
their is a theme for jailbroken iphones

Hello weird dragon symbol

It's 10:30pm here.
richfiles: since you are "Skyrimming" I send you this happy little song that just entered my mind and I can't get rid off *To the tune of 'Star Trekkin':* Sky-rimming! Across all Tamriel! Killing dragons, taking names; all in the gods' name! Sky-rimming! Wow that looked so cool! I didn't think that dragons~were that flamable!
I'm hoping a derpy fuck up
umm you know how rarity said that dash was gunna get it?
hmm
there is technical difficulties
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lg7ohqHAlD1qcv5z8o1_500.jpg
I know -_-
yeah...
that why
:D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxoGmVjAsmE
I'm actually kind of curious to see how they incorporate derpy for the rest of the season
o god she beat her to near death...awesome! but no :(
Oh... Time to play Deus Ex!
I have a great idea for a Derpy scene ^_^
hi~
He he he.... my friend sent me a text message titled "Im hugging applebloom" and he was hugging a dictionary
that or the mods are napping
hehehe
If they do t all.
Lol
i have been reading an amaing fanfic
.... you know what that means...
was it a one time thing, or will she be "appearing" more oftem
:)
I don't have any brony friends :(
cupcakes?
no one knows
lol well the stream i was watching when derpy was said the comments crashed the stream...
I have a few at my school.
POST PONIES!!
I think they might just have her remain as a background character, just with talking and what not.
i doubt she will appear as often
Sadly I hate most of them. But some of them are awesome
I only have like 3
*posts*
._.
ponies ponies ponies
well i mean talking wise
da hell
When Rainbow Dash is in the hosipatal, There is no way she can communicate with her friends, so she rights a letter, Who delivers it? :D
:$
/me yawns "u guys r still here?"
My friends are scared of becoming bronies
AND IM THE ONLY ONE WITH THE SHIRT
i got away for five seconds
so they refuse to watch it
go
I'm trying to get my friend into em, but he refuses to watch.

hooray, i drawded a picture
I prefer eh--grunge slowcore and visual kei
Gotta love the bufferin
i'm reading "Article 2"
but my sister got me into emocore
pretty good
i saw that also, do you actually need to know anything about DnD to follow it?
throw money at me and give me highlights in my hair

I like certain screamo
Also GOD I HATE BRUSSEL SPROUTS UGH

Why? They are so squishy...
... so... am I supposed to be seeing any video?
Bronie friends. I have like 213 xD
I love Brussels sprouts
good contribution kai
this episode may top the last one
Yeah, I want Derpy to have a fuck up and stab Dashie or somthing...
Broccoli is best vegetable
There's no stream atm.
When they're cooked correctly ,of course
One thing I kind of noticed is that a lot of bronys are emo :p
here is something to waste time before the new episode http://www.bronyland.com/pony-personality-test/
kay, wanted to make sure.
yeahh
Nothing is actually streaming right now, right? I can't tell if my internet's being wierd again or not.
I had to look up brussels sprouts
thatnk you, Polydunami.
thank*
no you're good
nah
I don't need a test to tell me what I already know
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgzczgn4ezo this is currently my favourite band
Ok thanks
thanks.... and speaking of D&D, I have to host a game this afternoon.....

i tried going there, it would never load
I already know RBD is the pony for me :)
ooooooooooo
she's so quiet and nice
Example, me: http://i.imgur.com/o9lkb.jpg
I always thought brussel sprouts looked like saibamen
I don't like them too mushy
I got Pinkie:O
lol
we call them rosenkohl here...rose cabbage
just like me <3
i am the 100,000th visitor

Sometimes I can't tell if it's just me or the stream itself
I like your hair

I just want another Derpy moment, Or another Fan pony moment
I'm most like rainbow dash... represent

???
..........
VINYL SCRATCH HAS TO BE NEXT FOR A FAN MOMENT!
I love the "build up" before they made Derpy canon. The last ep she was in before canon was Hearth warming eve, and she was waving at us from behind the curtain.
Big Mac needs more lines
My love belongs to rainbow dash
eeyup
I have over 3 gigs of MLP CLOP pictures :D
WHAT IS THIS!??! O_O
woops
lyra and bon bon already have that griffin village song

chip tune death metal?
Dude.
oaah
erie, PA
Im not a big metal fan-
Like holy shit O_O
Brooklyn, NY reporting in
i love futashy
приветик
so you're from germany then?
theres no words but its epic
Oh this is awesome O_O
That music is pretty sweet actually.
Edinburgh, UK
they had the most common inital reaction
Lenox, GA.... USA
shock and elevated interest
3 gigs of clop pictures...i dont even have 1 gig of regualar mlp pictures
but mostly shock
Note to self
crashed again, youtube dont like me to day
hello?
Do not mis click the video.
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZHIsGM_AQ_8/TyDJiIJrVoI/AAAAAAAAciM/KgKqVqrkQ-g/s1600/151.jpg
wow 3 gigs :O
yes
I would like a My Little Dashie refrence, If they're capeple of that
and very frequent
It's a comp of about 3 archives
on the left...
oi, I need some sleep
:s
like every five minutes
to the bed!
It depends on the channel sometimes
but is that a deadmou5 shirt?
yeah
yeah and it's got all the tumblar's up until december 2011
I studied german for a while
i like the clop pics but im not that insane
that's why i like the BBC
no ads
hellz yeah
so like pinkamenadianepie
by crooked trees
why?
damn right
you guys have to remember, this show is not only for us internet junkies
really.... diddn't know that
It was fun
Is there any video currently on the stream?
I think they are not allowed to read fanfics.
PBS our ad-free channel here
cool
german and english has a lot of similarities
if you guys haven't seen it it's a one on one with Pinkamena as she prepares ponies from ponyville for cupcake making.
http://mlfw.info/f/2507/
Public Funded as a result
hahaha lol i only have 49 MB
yer
they have the same roots....are just different dialects of the same language
lol
If you guys have links to archives let me know
Indeed, almost time for canon shiping.
haha puny amount of pictures is puny
But at least they entertain us when they start requesting donations
Valentine
I honestly don't participate in the clopping to pony pics... it would take the innocence out of it
might ruin soo many ships
lol
lol
plus the british had the norman invasion
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-YFDV-5x8A&feature=related
But its fun
not for me
*shrug* :I
here it's payed by tv licence
no offense against people who do, hey if thats your thing... thats your thing...
Here's 50 minutes worth of opera, please donate
just kinda weirds me out
yeah rule 34 with ponies kinda taints it for me
personally speaking
Yeah its not for me either.
There aren't even enough male characters for all mane 6 to even have crushes on...
They are still innocent and that's what makes it so much better
I mostly clop to Rainbow Dash
ironically rule 34 is what i first saw if mlp
I mean its not my thing.
eyup
No way that cash cow is going to be seen on public television
first thing I saw of mlp... if you can believe this, was on the first commercials for the hub
lol
haha
opera.... not Oprah
test
oh right
oh LOL
when they had they're little 2 second spots all around the dancing hub ball whatever thing
people who "clop" to mlp start threads about who can fap to the most unfappable picture
I mean if you think logically they would never do a like pinkshy or twijack ever, cause its a kid show.
pffthahaha
one two three
*puts on hipster glasses*
Oooh, so you've been there right from the start?
and people will post pictures they belive are unfappable
:P
That would be 4chan
two two four
gimme a break, it's 6:30AM
hey
6_9
is the video working for anyone?
yeah
lies
just asking
I came back to history
yeah-
it's 11:39
how do you guys like that song?
What?
gosh that just sounds...awful
well, I wouldn't say there, I didn't get really into the show until much later
there is no video yet
330AM
Btw, my bets on this episode ending with big mac "staying" in love with cheerlie
ok
but that fascination was there right when I saw it
oh sush you
its Loading Screen: the movie
two, eight, makes no difference to me.
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/585/8f74fca625bb3b6b2552f98.jpg/
I was like WHAT IS THAT SHOW!?!?!
Cheerilee is so cute-
12:40
did fosters home for imaginary friends get a movie?
fucking love homestuck bro :D
yes
yes
But I see it
it had like 3
indeed
It's a bit too metally for me
nice
fuck yes
lol I became a brony in November
Hi
even here i can see it
i remember that show
same
a rarity
hey wait, weren't the normans french?
The very first thing I saw was the Ponycraft 2 video, and after watching that I instantly watched the first 6 episodes.
trying to rise without me noticing
its fan music from the book
should change your nick
i got pinkie
Sorry I havn't been saying much
I like loud angry music, but I like broken guitars and burnt amplifiers when I do
Art of the Dress turned me into a brony
oh wait nvm
mm Havent read the book
heh
I ask because the great and powerful lauren faust was one of the leads on that show
Celestia is planing something?
dooooooeetttttt
how many hours is it till the episode starts?
i was looking up what the hell was dubstep and i stumbled onto rainbow dash dubstep
I wonder how many shows on the hub got movies
Wait, What are we talking about?
Which is odd, because I didnt watch cartoons that much. I was a fan of Samurai Jack and Dexter's Lab and that's it.
most likely
DOES ANYONE GET STUCK WITH THE rendering icon
About three
OH
GOOD
GOD!
I guess it's just a matter of opinion and taste
stream is down
can you imagine the uproar...
Three and a half>
I know the hub is new but does anyone know if any of the shows got a movie yet?
?
wat r u guys debating?
Except when it comes to brussel sprouts, because you aren't human duh
oh thx\
love brussle sproutd
do not fret
._.
when the first MLP FIM MOVIE COMES OUT!?!
Well, they have approximately 3 hours to get it back up

10,02So glad you all are behaving still :3

Hmmm, somehow I cant imagine that happening right now.
Nothing to see here slash ajlie

Good Luck, brave Bronystate

Sleep well SuperBrony64

llol sleep is for the weak
-.- dont say that
Discord escaping again OH DEAR GOD YES!
like last week......
they were, brusselsprout...brought the romanic parts of the english language in....mnostly administrative and military terms
Instead of thinking of the rendering circle, try to realize the truth! "Which truth?" That there is no stream... Then you will realize that it is not the rendering circle that spins... it is only the stand-by
yessss
lets play a game
when i like lagged to bad i missed it
@string -.- don't say that
Sorry
I don't get the Hub :(...... or cable for that mater
ponies are here to stay
discord turning luna back into nightmare moon
hehe

that makes sense.
OMG!
The chat pretty much broke down
D:
It's 3:16 here
the commoners kept their old germanic terms
nah. they are goign to introduce a new evil
I have reservations about tv series making a feature length movie...
i know that feal bro
and the mane six go on an adventure to save her
Aw, Kai
feel....
a fat joke a day keeps episode 3 away
It's ok
Celestia will get a longer scene
3:43
I'm having an arguement with a freind, Was rose the worst companion, but tennant the best doctor
we are talking about a mlp movie
lol no, it'd be the cmc getting their cutie marks if that weren't happening in eps 25-27
That's what the internet is for now
Hellos!
NO BETTER
yeaah
I was just talking to this guy about something similiar to this
and luna will prob fight by her side
along with the mane 6
I would jizz if they made a My Little Dashie movie
ja
Celestia will Die
discord turns celestia evil
i love how it took like 2 secs for people to realise
I rarely watch television, myself
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZkmy__oyYw Heres the music I grew up with and love the most
against a new evil
derpy was there
morning?
Hiya

No discord and no nightmare moon

lol
but Bonbon will prob end up having a conversation with lyra
Think about it?
I'm not
:'(:D
humans?! are you mad?!
if you say phoenix wright I will stab you
it should be a live action/animated movie
hehehe
But the streams not for another...
I grew up with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMX2lPum_pg
We could make anything off of that
god loves bronies
I want to see derpy's parents, derphim and derpa
10,02Behave now you all while I sleep ^_^
This is yet another AJ episode
Bonbon and lyra will have a canon momment where they bolth speak to eachother
no humans in equestria, they ruin all the best fanfics
3 hours 14 minutes and 45 seconds
im getting scared
10,02OR ELSE O_________o
good
indeed
ohh I remember that band
no seaponys either
lack of fluttershy makes some bronies long for nuclear winter, apparently.
really? another aj? damn
you should be
it will be a clop movie
10,02Have fun :>
or beetleponies
I still love them
Fine by me
Soo for me that's... 3pm
how come?
my sister was very into things like this when I was younger
night superbrony
only one I ever did like was the phoenix wright one... BUT I MUST KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND I HATE THINKING ABOUT IT
my comp jeeps flickering
Personally, I grew up with Guns n' Roses. Thanks to my mum :P
It rubs off on ya
i was in to techno
hehe
lol
this one is probably making up for Derpy stealing the show last time
octavia will be at the next grand galloping gala
well maybe they could do an adventure episode where they meet seaponies?
hopefully alongside lyra
bright to dim
Also Blink 182, Green day, Linkin park were what I grew up with :p
my father used to play pink floyd
and grunge-
im having fluttershy withdrawls
and silence
^
keep it going till 4pm
SuperBrony64|Zzz: Wubz us in his sleep
no seaponies
its possesed.... have fun
I grew up with visual kei as my first musical love
then you can die a happy man
at the next gala, 10 bucks that vinyl and octavia collab
like somewhat what they did when they showed cloudsdale
no video for me either
I have yet to see a fanmade seapony that looked good
it feels like the render circle is staring into my soul
I have one problem with that
thx
Oh god, Linkin Park. They used to be my fav.
vinyl may be at the next grand galloping gala
i wonder if octavia really is pinkies sister...
before that I liked black metal for a very short period
no beetle ponies... y not beatle ponies?
what does the symptoms look like?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTkyUNHBzMA small dose of fluttershy
I thought The Last Roundup was enjoyable
For me it'll be 1:00 PM
10,02Ictiv: IKR
time turn on a light
remember how celestia said the grand galloping gala always sucked
I miss music like this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAjKEv3cvhY
OH SHIT!
i did not see any seaponies yet
Fairy ponies
well maybe this year it won't
Derpy notwithstanding
So who here is male? type BONY if your a dude :D
BRONY
octavia is not
Hooray for Afternoon Ponies!
it's usually around 3:00
But think about it, The story line will somthing like, Discord shatters the dimenstions, having ponies meet there human selves!
brony

There we gp
I dont know much about weezer
*go
scambled eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon
cuz then they'd have to come out with human toys and shit
Only the first album
Exactly
Great. I can't move or he'll wake up.
girls would cause fires
and anything else i can find
Or: they meet with ALIENS who want to colonize them. The ponies suddenly invent gunpowder/synthetic fuel and build a massive army and battle it out with the Aliens. Directed by Michael Bay.
/me sighs.

Little girls would start fires if hasbro didn't come out with human forms of the ponies if they did that
Making a big breakfast
*cuddles Ictiv and Superbrony*
/me explodes "directed by Micheal Bay"
more open minded musically I guess
no
the movie'll probably be about the mane 6 going on a trip with zecora to her home country, and mad crazy shizz is going down requiring the EOH

i will
so close :3
^
Im not a big fan of synths unless htey are organic or the cure
remember MLP is and forever will be an internet thing
yeah
Will it be live streamed here?
10,02Awesome :D
10,02You'll enjoy it ^_^
Please tell me it will
the real humans in spongebob was stupid though
Err, you realise it's 3 hours in EVERY time zone right
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeSUuj98Rx0
Literally my middle school consisted of me sitting behind my school for 3 hours starting to listent to punk rock and would end with me spinning in circles listening to "around the world"
so what are you guys doing right now?
but we don't run MLP
except for that one pirate
well spongebob went straight down after the original writer quit
LOL
but bronys are a internet thing
10,02Hopefully you'll visit Brony Movie Night after at 2 PM EST for even more fun ^_^
Lol
Ah ze good old days
So it will be 3 hours anyway?
we dont run mlp... we just greatly influence it
Fanfics i am reading: Y U NO UPDATE?!!!
yup
right
3 hours from now. correct?
then that one pot head comes around the corner and sees you
Well I may play some Garrys Mod for a bit
Everypony... why is the video not working?
we must remember that
And 10 minutes yes
Omg! Ponies meeting Bronies!
hehehe
There's nothing playing
and lets leave it as that shall we
but it would be better if mlp was on nick
Or a brony..
stupid ads
Also, if anyone sees some "new" cereal called Krave on the store shelves
Waiting and texting my friends (they can't stay up as late as me, unfortunatley)
or the pony gods will be angered
or cartoon network
and all you had to say was "daft punk" and he understood completely
Because there's nothing streaming
lol
Oh.
Skip it
The screen is suposto be black.... right?
I haven't been keeping up with much besides Antipodes now that I'm done with FoE. Any good suggestions?
wouldnt miss it for the world
it's been here for ages
*amused*
if mlp was on cartoon network it would get more appreciation
stream is down atm :(
Silly philly
Can they just stream batman like last week?
It is a horrible thing
lol chatting with my buddy on steAM About ponys to
it's like chocolate crap?
cupcakes jk
well yeah it would but
yer
Dammit, I'll be back with the intended nickname
yes
yeah
Just waiting for the new episode
thats so sick
LOADING SCREEN 2: the longest buffer
yesh
sigh
it would be inffluenced to much by the fans
Cheers for the info :D
And going to bed now. Night
i like cheerios
but since it's on the hub, not many people see it because the hub is not in as many as nick or cartoon network
There we go
Yeah..I miss those days
I might watch a Harry Potter movie, or even possible play some SIMS, but thats unlikely
My aunt bought it for my cousin
I really want it to be on a different channel
with plenty of sugar
However most people that were like me would skateboard all day and shit
If anyone gets spare tickets to bronycon
cousin rejected it
I miss Crispix
Send them to me
yeah, there are some fans I dont even want to be reconised by the creators
Yeah, it's not broadcast in England at all D:
chill bronies we'll still get a movie
never had them
and now I must finish it
cuz honestly I dont watch any of the other shows on the channel
too much consistency in cherrios
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaxBzqCSUfk&feature=related Noise, was so awesome
hmm yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkEsOu8DFmE fluttershy singing <3
10,02wub wub wub Fluttershy is best pony wub wub wub
so it doesn't go to waste
I live in a rural area
i like em tho
just as long as we continue to prove we are here to stay
Hello :3
NOPE. I would spend my days either sleeping behind some shop listening to music
If only i was in usa would roadtrip for that not a second to lose
and as such most kids around me listened to country
I barely know of the other shows on the channel
and I really dont see the hub... going big? like nick or CN
It's like stale cereal left to turn soggy
and or going home and playing runescape XD
Strawberry shortcake
i mix em with other ceral
FAP TIME!
10,02Yay!

Will do
Ahh, but it's not a stream yet, is it
Silly fillys L:
GOOD NAP TO YOU ALL
hmm

YAY! I can see the sun's rays peeking over the horizon!.....
:O Does anyone else have the flu?
I'll probably just wait

the closest to country I get is Geraldine Fibbers
and now...I shall be back in a moment. I must internet.
nice
like I would with Cheerios
Fluttershy... IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
and what will it be about

but thats like--grunge country?
Staring at the countdown
I'm gonna cry
I HAVE DONE IT!!!

Same here Kai
Waiting
For that moment
I've got an alarm
cheerios need sugar
i know i wanted to cry to

:L
no sun here yet, just snow...
mlp needs a few more seasons before we startthinking about movies
no
yeah
no ryan but i have a more serious case of the fell
I'd have no idea.
then we started talking about why we won't see a big movie like spongebob squarepants the movie
love this song to death
Lol
It's too good...
mang
Night all
:D Classic
they dont
straight to DVD with these ponies
wheres dis stream at
I kinda wish, fox would leave it alone
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibJZUXuD16s
yes
My current cereal love is Rice Krispies with warm milk and a dash of brown sugar
I mean not all bronies are creepy like that
yer
sounds good
This is why all fluttershy shipper are dicks.
but the DVD's will sell like hotcakes
Exactly what happens to me every Saturday night
I think shes gay, she sings about girls, ALOT
fox whO?
If there is a movie it better still have the same animation and bull shit cgi
Fluttershy is good on her own.
FOX news
First time I've done the stream
The Live show was an absolute horror
I'm gonna be honest, I just came for the company, I always watch the ep on 1080 later in the day. Later ponyfolk.
and no*
umm unhealthy much?
It's got all the makings of comfort food
ricicles nice
pony pony pony sawg
yeah, dont pull a drawn together on us and change the animation to flash
hi
sounds like more work than i'm willing to put into a bowl of cereal at 7AM :$
but might try
pcce out bro
meh everything i do is unhealthy
I have returned from interneting...I found this.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=UPRnu8rv_IU
Cool! My first time was the Pound and Pumpkin cake episode
its in flash already
isnt it already flash?
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/039/shrugging-pinkie-pie.png
lol
I love that song!
fluttershy are you on steam?
I think it's flash :P
Geez.... I just had a hot pocket and now I want cereal:|
well they somewhgat changed to the style making it smoother
ugh the drawn together movie was dissappointing
yum here comes teh cooked breakfast
and it didnt really feel like drawn together
get some then
has anyone seen the Pound Puppies reboot?
yuppers
Considering that it's Rice Krispies, repony, most of the nutrition there is in the milk itself
I think I am on the weird side of youtube again...
fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
well so far my experiment is working
indeed
hehehe
I found this place via that derpy talking video
I figure if I can't microwave or easily put it in the oven, it's not something I should be messing around with.. hehe
No
I'm sitting here wondering whether I should do the stream
the rest if cardboard
Experiemnt?
is*
Do you go on Equestria Daily's chat room?
what experiment
trust me when groundbreaking mlp merch like Movies, and tv-show like plushies and toys. We'll possibly see a season 5
k idid not know that
on Steam
maybe even 6
I THINK I WILL!!:[
Is there something on your screen, or am I the only one with a buffer screen?
Go on...
but it won't end at season 3
9
the odd side of youtube
great
Hell, I made a spray for CSS using that shrugging pic, plus a few others :D
no. just made made my steam account yestarsdya
no stream here
hehe
omg i cant type today
yeah, I do expect to see a load more seasons
Okay
Ah Ok Fluttershy
lol i think i might be the only one here who is playing minecraft
what if my little dashie was true and we get 8 seasons of pony?!
I guess up until season 5
hey if you never try frying stuff you'll never learn
Do you have any games on the account?
I kinda feel like we also need a better image in the public eye before we start asking for stuff like merch, or movies
They just need to come out with stuff people actyually wanna buy
...... brb :|
nope!
and not a fluttershy that looks like RBD
*points at broniesftw* OBJECTION!
Well everyone has TF2
so what's everyones best breakfast?
has anyone revealed their name before in here?
I'm in Australia and it's currently 5 to 11 at night. I don't think I'd have much of a tomorrow if I watched it live
Assuming it's installed
we had a stream 3 hours ago..but then something happened
lol dragonshy
Hm... based on the current situation it's about 5 seasons
seriously wtf...hasbro
i dunno
i dont have minecraft
paul shuman, have fun
trying to record the stream and chat, computer is to slow for screencapping (and the design of x11 hardly helps) so i'm being clever
I'd be up for atacking a tf2 server
I meant have they bought any
lol well there is a sever i have in my list that is empty
like libunao
I know
best breakfast is pancakes with egg and sausage
Lewis Carlin, there you g
Not to my knowledge
the tescos in my town now is selling ponies, and I feel I have to buy to prove myself
go
This is true. I'd say my best breakfast is belgian waffles with a side of bacon.
Their Celestia is pink
son i am dissapoint
In their tongue, she is Dovashiin, DRAGONSHY!
just tf2. this comp cant
nice
^
i have terraria
FUS RO *yay*

Pink celestia=Trollestia

FUS ROH D'aww
:[ Screw you Hasbro
I used to play minecraft alot
close enough i suppose
but then I played terraria
eating teh breakfast at the table
Oh and strawberries powdered with a little sugar.
I mean honestly everytime bronies get a TV spot anywhere its a constant cringe
and then I stopped playing games for a while
Fluttershy, What is the email you made with steam?
I hope you don't record me saying anything compromising, Phase4
plus, have you seen how much these hand made plushies are going for on ebay
like a civilised person
fucking tons
I got a gift for you for showing me that song
please black it out
LOL
i would play terraria but it is not compatble with mac
like A BOSS
It's so tempting though
seems to be just loading for me
I'm also an Aussie
/me tries to behave
a fucking RBD pillow wen't for like 150 at bronycon jan2012

8 bit Ponies! http://www.youtube.com/user/RainbowCrash88
Lol
:D
here's the doll now if I can just find the actyualll ebay screenshot
You should find a game in there
but when the episode comes on it always crashes for me :(
why?
You can also look for someones name in the side and have a private chat
yes 2k
anyone remember playing games on 56k modem?
Well it's exactly the same name I picked here :D
well honestly
You click the #bronystate at the bottom
You can?
yes
Huh
Nightmare fuel, but I wouldn't mind having them *wink*
thaat sucked
oh god
Yep
ehhhh
I could buy a whole new DJ set up with that
although must admit, it does look a lot like the real thing
Not that I actually would in all likelyhood
that was bad
buahaha
damn
but I STILL MISS THe modem dialup sound
yep
eh
I LOVED that sound
:| The great and powerful Trixie does not approve of this
that's true
yeah it does
I was born in 1995...so...yeah...
hehehe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0
The dialup sound I recognize though.
uh oh, they aren't replaying the episode again at 10:30 this week.
problem is that when the episode starts
yeaa
yeah i got a g3 episode one time
This is my first time in the Twilight Theatre
if any of you are playing MC you should join my server
I probably wouldn't eiter, unless my friends were on and I would have liked to talk to them
it always crashes and i never know why
Nope, Espy
althoug there was this ONE time when they put the G3.5 series :D
The most expensive thing I bought was that japanese relief hat for 67 british pounds, thats it
Cheers
Oh god...
They're doing "Return of Harmony"
sweet god
Dammit
you all make me have so much nostalgia..
:P
on the ither channels
awesome, capturing at 15fps with fullscreen motion and no lag
that would be soul scorching
t was :D
ocarina of time
hehehe
I feel slightly less noobish now:)
Damn you brain! stop making me have nostalgis!
Gonna have to wait for someone to put on youtube to watch it a second time
otoh if the pattern is the same as last week, the itunes release will be out sooner too
I usually go to the theatre of whoever is this week's pony
but if you want a proper chat during the show, have a private chat, The comments just fly by when the episode starts
Anyway, where's fluttershy?
was tis agonizing
Oh god! n64 memories! Damn you!
here's rbd by the same artist
btw that fluttershy wen't for 2.5k
I grew up wihtout consoles
But decided to change it up today
Indeed
WAAA?
I only found all this out last week XD
last week hax mega just played the first one again, as he'd (obviously) recorded it
Ah, when Derpy spoke
she's in the middle of making derpy I thikn
randomly go to any channel
well Gorbash I know a lot of people do that
Ocarina of Time, hells yes.
LOL GordonFreemane
Yeah, I watched the Derpy one on YouTube. Shit be crazy
I grew up with N64 and gamecube
U missed out bro
IKR
I tend to go to the applejack channel for the show cuz it doesn't crash
aaaaaa
Yeah, I saw that bronystate video one
lol
my dad was a nerd,we had eh commodore 64 and 64c(ITHINK( Mz sharp, amiga 1200 and 500 and SEGACD32 and Computers
n64 was and is the est game system
:3
and there was like 5 k more on there than at any other time last week
When Derpy spoke, you could only see one thing:
best
Also, just found out when I did that that smileys auto-changed to ponies
DEPY!
the streaming is not working
Of course they do, though
wow dude. thank you
no love for applejack:'(
I grew up with the Dreamcast and PS1, but we had a N64 with a few games.
hehe
Eeyup
that rainbow dash is perfect -.-
anyway...
i know which is sad
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tajDxBaPBBM&feature=related
Half Life 2. And Lost Coast.
only spinning stuff
I wish i had that kind of money
But only some op them
Enjoy it.
well this is anoying, finished being clever and now i'm bored
Add me on Steam: ChaoDer01
Poke snap....majora mask... smash brothers...Sonic adventure battle 2.... super mario sunshine.... brawl melee....
she's my second favorite but I will say this though
3d mase
how come they cant find a way to mass produce merch like that?
OH GOD ITS ALL COMING BACK TO ME!
!
*of
Indeed :D :( :) :P
stream isn't working
I wish I just had the damn plushie
I can remember one person saying IS THIS REAL LIFE?
that was awesome
oooh windows
the creators played her as the straight man character
omg i loved smash bros
our fandom - show accurate plushies that go for like 2k Hasbro - pink Celstia
it wont work
sonic adventure 2 battle... i cried when my chao died
^3^/)
and those tend not to stick with audiences well
:D:(;)
mhmm
hiya rainbow dashin
Smash Bros is win.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=T260UBgmxKg
:P
:O
ME TOO T_T
yer
\)^.^
do you really want your loving ponie of friendship and toleration being made by sweatshop chinese childreN?
She's likeable but serious
:[
rest in peace Meteor
fail
Actually
cuz it would be too expensive
Yay! I'm learnding!
:O
I saw that one too<3:S
even if they did mass produce it
<3 :[ :'( 6_9 ;)
which they could
anybody here write fanfiction?
more like she's more normal than the rest of them
<3
tbh
i like her
Hi Digistar
Thats all I know
so she never got to stick out
....
I find it endearing in way. I definitely prefer it to Pinkie, who's a little too spastic for me.
yes...
6_9
it would cost like 50 dollars orsomething, and parents aren't spending 50 dollars on a plushie
D:
i dont get why people need every character to have a episode
I almost threw my tv out my window when my pure chao died
I just clicked on the face next to the chat bar
YOU MONSTER!
damnit, didn't work
I literally spent 2 years
they all work at what they do
watev i was born in 1997
making a pure chao
I'm writing my first now
Player don`t work Wtf?
And then when you click them in it shows what it is
>:O
i kinda get what you are saying Lovs but
i prefer ones with them all in
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Py0DUvG7s&feature=related
that was my childhood
get everything to the highest
and then it died.
i wrote a bad crossover
(6_9
almost recorded all the clips i need, bugeyes8
this season seems to be a bit Rarity and Rainbow heavy
It's just the trend that was set by previous episodes
oh, that's probably quicker
hey almsot everything comes from there now adays!
you need a balance
yer
Oops no bracket required :3
i cant decide
We
Cyrix...
so ur just gonna have to be rich
're nearly halfway into the season, give it time
Each character gets spotlighted on occasion
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
well I seen people other crap for higher prices
i know and i know why they did it like that
so it was taken as the norm
Thats them all
PS1 I remember cause a friend had it
That gave me so much nostalgia...
and we used to play MGS
I was a MASSIVE fan of Resident Evil.
And thats what I do as well XD
ever since meatspin i dont trust random links :\
for now at least
if I click on the stream popout it's shown
lol
I study economics.... and i aggree with LaQuack... sadly :/
maybe japan will help us out, i dunno
if you think about it, Rarity and Rainbow would cause the most conflict
pinkie pie is the best
Dont worry, non pg links get you kicked
but not this one :(
To be honest, I miss Twilight
just because of their personalities
Lol, I remember the first time I found meatspin.
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9
yes it is
We haven't seen her in a while
me too
It was terrifying.
fluttershy?
good song bad image
ugh why
I was attracted to that kinda guys at the time, so I wasnt freaked out
weird the video isn't playing
also youtube doesnt lead to anything like meatspin
well i am kinda glad they let her take a back seat for awhile
china*
Have some waiting music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoCjaC9Ro0c&feature=channel_video_title
97. 97. 1997. That makes you six years younger than me. And you wwebsite as on internet. when did I get old?
Everything does come from countries that have cheap laybour.
what does japan know about ponies
PINKIE IS INDEED BEST PONY
it is supposed to be about the six not her
Bexause there's no stream
I don't mind the back seat
What do you guys think of the public image of "the common brony"
laybour ?
I'm listening to Pony Swag XD
Garghragh
etc
i hate the public image
:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O:O
quite a trap
The public image is mixed
I love Pinkie too!
fuck yeah rainbowcrash88
times are changing bud
I was playing Half Life Deathmatch, then some guy said "Come here for hackz".
just as it should be
but you don't want her gone yeah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbLibnZzOI&feature=related
i'm looking at minecraft stuff
mixed?
honk honk blarg blarg
mixed
I just wish she'd get to stand in the actual background every once and a while
*slams head through desk*
aye
wall of pinkie pie!!!!!!
i dont know
*slams head through floor*
COnsidering everyones got there own public image of the brony its not consistent
chocolate sprouts
Blarg blarg honk?
how i got here
lol i was playing this on guitar half an hour ago
Awww Yeahhh
*slams head through earth*
Does honk mean yes?
between what and what? if you dont mind me asking
Indeed. Id be most displeased if I bit into a chocolate and discovered it was actually a sprout.
honk
*ends up in equestria*
:D
oh
blarg honk blarg
It does! Sweet!
well i never knew why people hated fox so much but then they attacjed mlp!
instead of fly by cameos
I can speak alien!
Î think season 1 needed to be Twilight heavy becasue she was more or less an outsider still, so she was good to set up the facts about how life in Ponyville and in general works
honk
you guys no about the minecraft mod where you can play as a pony?
blarg
IKR
lo that would be awesome
I can't wait for the videos to start
you're as sharp as a blunt and bent outta shape tack lad.
>Inconsistent >Still get flamed.
I'm probably not making any sense
they didn't "attack" mlp
Fox news is shit
not it makes sense to focus on others to balance things out
Yeah, mine little pony
BLARG.
i've seen pics
For parents to troll their kids I guess.
:D
now it makes*
I wish that were possible.
I've used it
chocolate sprouts, some get chocolate others scream and shout
...actually, now that I think about it, 14 is how old I was when I first got in trouble for stuff I did on the internet...
it would be aweesome If i got turned into a pony on the way
did fluttershy get an episode yet
FOX is
i could watch it on cable but dont feel like it
nope
A brony to some 1 who does not understand is a creepy guy (Most of the time.) and to those who know the show its a normal guy.
not really
honk blarg blarg honk honk

brace yourselves applejack being ignored again is coming
I don't paly minecraft, but I've seen ti on youtube (the mod)
IT'S PONY DAY
Unfortuneately it makes you look retarded to other players
I kinda want to see her bear grappling abilities again
*it
Most of all we are looked at as a trend
lol O meant FOX is a comedy I think
exactly
just a trend guys
how dare you call fox news? I got family that is news and you insulted them all !
noooooooooooo
People hate fox news because they use the term "Fair and Balanced" when they're rightwing nutballs
I dunno Vivix, I quite like having fingers.
Ehhh... People who don't understand or bother to, prefer to rage.
:D
attacked slandered w/e
gotta get down on pony day
In this season? nope, but she was in a song
I mean there is plenty of NORMAL bronies we arent all freaky
well it used to be that twilight was the one who had to learn about friendship, now it's everyone
Those are raw sprouts too.
I do too but if i were to go to equestia--as a huuman?
Well, technically last week she had too much attention
Fuck fingers
Applejack makes me thirsty
I seriously had my jaw drop when that happened
It wouldnt turn out well
take that MMA guy on youtube for example
if I get to meet fluttershy at the cost of fingers
Fluttershy friday was yesterday
i wonder what would happen if some one got transported to equestria and ended up in ponyvill
hell Ill do it
like a physical shock
I see this season as taking a look at characters who had little say in the previous season
mmhmm
Fox news is just trying to appeal to a mass audience
speak for yourself iam halfway between crazy and
Sure it would. Just find Fluttershy and she'll take care of you :D
I can't watch ponies on tv at all here :(
old republics down and ponys are 2 hours off. sad day
her spotlight did get taken by derpy
sweetiebelle saturday
ToRs down?
well the thing is
I garuantee you at least one person who works for fox news is a brony
hehehe
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why are they running the episodes together though?
i can only watch reruns
I helped make apple cider once! hard work, but deliciouser than you could imagine...
Of all the worst things that could've happened
This is
and me, I'm a professional break/hip hop dancer and DJ... were cool people!
THE
WORST
i talk to meself
For some reason when i giggle at the ghosties it turns into a maniacal laugh
i mean we have two aj episodes in a row
POSSIBLE
yeah
I can catch them if i wake up early for school
lol
THING!
lol because fluttershy is best poy
But only re runs
he did the research into the names of the ponies
yeaah-
wow, there are alot of join/part messages
Hi!!
If you think about it, everyone has some degree of insanity
and rainbow had two in a row and so on
pony
Indeed she is :3
I talk to my other selfs all the time
Fluttershy is definitely best pony.
Ursa Major monday
yeah, everyone is crazy
Yeah, I'm not too fond of that choice either
i hate when my firned wanders into the wierd part of youtube and kee[s sending me vids
i'm just wondering why they ran it like that and not mix it up
like two rainbowdash shows too
and iam everyone of you
3 hours everypony
Matter of how crazy.
Really? Oh I guess your on an actual IRC client thing
geez guys, you could've let Dragonshy finish the bit
ish
WHY MEEEEEE? WHYYYY?
im in college so no class
lol
Insanity is like gravity, all it needs is a little push.
I like "batshit" as a measure.
Hmm
crap

People stop saying "hurr I'm slightly insane" if you think you're insane it means you aren't insane
well i only saw the one where they said being a brony was a mental condition
oh god im on the﻿ dark side of youtube again
i talk to me computer and tea cup and all the other items around me
I have a new nostalgic topic
Indeed Phase4, personally I disabled them in my IRC client
I guarantee you at least one person in every country in the world is a brony... yes even nations in Africa
Kingdom hearts 2
can watch it whenever
sry slow typer
I've been here for an hour then :D
well see this universe is actually a figment of my immagination and you're all aspects
An insane person does not know he/she's insane
i've got a naturaly creepy,maniacal laugh
lol, well I have an insane side to a point, I just dont think that the pony loving side of me is anywhere near that
applejack ~ 
You should do
:3
Anyone?
scrw your imagination
I never played that actually. I played the first though.
6_9
OMG
/join #BattlelogBronies
there not a stream up right now?
Though, now that I think about it, it may have to do with the episodes themselves
crusaders just finished for me, have some more music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voj9MhBUaTI
my imagination is better
Erm, they do Thunderponi.
THE KEY BLADE
We
:D!
loving this atm
I KNOW THIS
oops
I can't laugh without launching into diabolica laughter
No
it shouldn't be "insane" or crazy to like show
No they don't
only because i immagined it to be !
I love kh2 :3
They do to some extent
i dont have imagination
im thinking it might be their animation schedule
Sephiroph. That is all.
or am I just everyday 'm bufferin?
No inq, there's not
Even though they're branded as -insert character- episodes
i think i still have it
neither can i
Only if they're too far in they don't realise it, then, they don't
they said it was hectic and it might be easier to focus on a character at a time
Sorry about that
lol k thx
*High five*
They don't always focus on that character
Scootaloo Saturday.
:D
gosh i finally caught up to the chat
did any one play pokemon?
:(
We could take over the world together!
Then again, not all alcoholics admit to being alcoholic. (Not comparing)
:O
as much as the description implies, that is
hmm
:)
my eyes!
i know im just wondering if it is the schedule though
everyday im buffering too
I played Pokemon Blue.
It's part of how you define insanity
but yeah... No ponies for me unless i wake up at around 6 - 6:30
6_9
:3
VinylXOctavia guys! Allegrezza is a shipping fanfinc I think every brony should read
Not very much though
true
Good morning everypony

:O

I dunno why, but I never really liked it.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1O0ErRhdoI this is better

Well, granted. But it isn't that far-out twisted.
:)
gewd morning
It's 11pm here
god damnit
mornin!
ive had my coffee and im def gonna make it to new episode!
One episode looked at Rainbow Dash and her ego, for example
Well no ponies for me unless, wait I'm in England... 3 pm ponies suckas!
Morning.
:3
Mornan'
Heya
I mean, there are >some< values that are universal
hey :)
We dont celebrate halloween here-
even though its 2 pm here
are there no heterosexuals in equestira
I;ve got the laugh
Ohai dar
can't argue with that
Organization 13! WOO! :D
or well, not when I was in my teens
and then the following episode was more about Tank
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBwiv_Bt3-c&list=PL135BC4EC53F0CEA5&index=1&feature=plpp_video this is one of my fav pony songs
Its slowly becmoing popular now
XD true
rarity is hetero right?
Hiya
even though Rainbow held a key role
Can't believe I wasn't here when derpy talked
Meanwhile, in ridiculous land, I've been up for 24 hours. I hope I don't give up in the little time that's left.
Great... now I have becoming popular stuck in my head...
Oh well, the youtube video was hilarious enough
Shame :/
do you think that'll be in the episode where someone doesn't like Pinkie?
no heterosexuals in equestria?
Derpy has the same VA as Rarity...
I love that soong
and Im happy with it...
same
lol my friend jail broke my ipod so i got a bunch of game boy advanced games on there
Is it just me, or is something being streamed that i cant see?
well the fan fics
I think the Art of the dress one was better :/
stick you might want to take it easy then
what about mr and mrs cake?
My intial reaction was O.o
just you
ture
Derpy was mistaken for a colt.
noo its off
:P
Nothing's being streamed.
if they dont likke pinkie i will end them.
*RAGE*
does anyone know where the option to remove join/part messages is in xchat?
^
true*
I'm just here because 1: I'm up and 2: I want to see what people post during
I have to stay up all night to catch the livestram, but I don't mind, because i STAY UP LATE ANYWAYS.
I wish the stream was 24 hours
k then

My Little Dashie... so good....
shame
yup
We kept our hoovsies warm at home
Imma play some gmod for a but I'll be back later, hopefully as Dragonshy again
nope.avi
night
I found the voice fitting though
my facourite s2 song is probablyyy--find a pet
still a girly voice though
Applejack didn't have a heavy presence last week, as the show was stolen by almost everyone else
I thought it would be in Hearth's Warming, then in Baby Cakes, now I'm just hoping, not expecting
I hope so.
Indeed. I took a 5 hour energy against my better judgement at 2 to help me finish a vectoring, but now I'm worried I'll die.
I keep thinking were talking about guns
for a boy at least
FAREWELL!!!!
kk
colt 1911 45 acp.

Damn it right it is Sugar-Rush
Lol

is it just me or is the stream not working
Ah horseapples! I forgot this computer is craptastic that live streams never load for me.

Yes
Either way, I still don't like the whole doubling up of episodes
my fav was prob winter wrap up
i can't see too many taking my username
my top three songs are 1) winter wrap up 2)art of the dress 3)gala
oh god yes
Is there anything on this stream yet?
laawl

I'm always Sugar-Rush
i could barely finish it
stick, streams down
oh yeah thats hiigh up to me too
I don't need caffine, my mind is crazy enough as it is
enough of my babbling

Phase4
I don't see anything :/
and I always go into the Pinkie's room
but as for s2 its find a pet. persoally

You in Melbourne (or Victoria), Rush?
Fun fact, I hated musical numbers till I started watching ponies.
damn, no sound
is it like, disney pixar sad? or like dog dies at the end of movie sag?
its me too pony-_2718
your babbling gets discussion going
SAME
the stream is down @pony_2718
mine has never been taken though it should
overall winter wrap up followed by at the gala
I loved old musicals
Even then, when it's up I'm worried that I won't be able to watch.
First fic i ever read. A "Good" start id say ;D
better than looking at a loading screen
Bump bump bump Hello everyone, good morning C:
yeah
wont my little dashie be non canon when we find out whos dashes parents are
kay
I'll hope for the best though.
Ausbronys woo

lol you all should join this server on MC if you have it 70.34.195.106
if the stream isnt up in time, I'll use a stickcam account and host it.
melbourne is the best city, everypony knows it :)
I have never got into fan fiction
i havent read it but people say its bad

It's a tad OtT on the describing
Stream's in 3 hours...
It's about octavia meeting vinyl for the first time, things get heated but Lyra and Bonbon cool down the temp later on
Party reasonably

Especially since it's so late
Gonna go grab a bite to eat.
it's in sydney sometime in 2013
party soft
But hey, I sit alone in my room at 11pm at night
Be back later
Allegrezza Guys

sweet apple massacre is good
/me bobs head
I'mma plug in mah copy of space marine and butcher me some orkz while i wait 2 and a half hours for ponies
i know a badly written story when i see one
^
you know i was going through the episode list
point to rush
I wanna write a fanfic now ^_^
psh, eating?

pcce
cant afford to go out so pony time
i like AUS anyway but even better with ponys.
and Dave Polsky hasn't written any this season
:D
IE.... *cringes*
computers don't need to eat
n1ghtmar3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV2PQ1GptFQ&feature=fvst
hmm
What's an eating?
at least yet
suxs
I kinda want to read fanfics but I know I just suck at reading
Don't even mention that browser.
YEEEESSSSSS
something humans do
:S
what is this eating you speak of
im just wondering because his was the two most controversial
i dont want to mix horror/death/ect with MLP
That's weird
it's nonsense.
does anyone know Pinkie Guy (needsmoredjent)? He's headlining, apparently, and I really want to go
Quick question
Over a Barrel and Pinkie Sense
Go listen to em on Youtube then brah. :p
The best fanfics are the ones about BG ponies
suck at reading? you just read this!
pay it no mind.
Awesome
My imagination is really crazy, yet bad 6_9
Ahh.. that was another part of my childhood ;p
whats a human?
silly humans
is the screen for the stream meant to be just loading
because after a while I stop reading and im just saying the word loudly in my head but im not thinking what the hells going on
because BG ponies have a clean slate
both things will be ruined for me then
yes
ot is it just my computer?
I hate how there's no :Applejack: emoticon
CelticBrony needs to be here :(
yes
or*
good
I've decided to start writing fanfics, seeing as I wrote hundreds of stories unrelated to mlp already
pinkie guy
Disturbed? I'm game :P
hai thar everypony ^_^
I still need to fix my toy fluttershy's hair.
If it's 2013, I might be allowed to go alone (I'm a younger bron)

The angriest music I liked--hm
ohaider
I missed move night ;__;
/me turns into human "this Digistar"

Haey
ello
O hea
musician on youtube
and your prior conseption of ponies are most likely to tarnish any fanfic that includes them as mane characters
I dont think I can post nega
actually no, I'm not really sad because the movies sucked
least your comp is not flickering
Hi Scootachicken

Stick
Up, and My little Dashie.
here is a method
Phase4: ping.
pressed enter
yay...
instead of just 22
is the stream playing anything atm or down for all?
It's as bad as Sweetie Belle cooking :S
Chrome Crashed
Sorry about that XD It's just my Ponyona's name
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKeMCXKSk5c&list=PL3551304C11D8F6EC&feature=plpp_play_all
not witchcraft Digistar, im just half human
i dont have much to spend my money on
Tried splashing water and rubbing it in your eyes?
Does anyone remember that 10-minute Trixie epic on EqD a couple of months back? That was him, and had everything from death metal to dubstep in the one track
It's down for me
Bane_Kai, yup
You don't need a movie when you got awsome fan made music in the background ^^
immma bored
Well seeing as I just had a shower... yes.
no i was tryong to write a poem
Hmmmn
stream is down
Well you got 2.75 hours yet
My little dashie mad me depressed for about 2 weeks.
Oh?
:(
ahh i see makes more sense than witchcraft
I liked Up, but only the beginning... the movie after the dude's wife died was a let down
thanks bro :)
I kinda wish I was born earlier, sounds like I missed a lot of music and tech stuff I would've loved :P
sweet
It was rather disapointing, B movies dont have to be bad, just not really mainstream.
Don't worry about me. I'll complain, but I'm sure I'll be fine.
Eurobeat Brony - Discord (The Living Tombstone's Remix)

Hello everypony.
Starflash, you know that wall of French text I pasted to you a couple days ago?
okay, makes more sense
Hold on
There was an indian, irishman, and an australian walking across the Sydeney harbour bridge, they were walking their dogs and decided to make a bet to see who could get their dog over and back without the dog farting
I like the video though
oh i know
I run on 14.4 interwebs
98,000 a year
anypony know when its gona be up
Hello, shrimp.
Yeah.
hi, shrimpy.

Englishman not irisman
that was for a test
at the moment
well it will be up for pony later
dun like the animation though
:O
Perfson, ya rly
I wish I knew.
which I think I actually did alright in
Derpy you crashed my interwebs
they needd to fire that dude
but NOt suure if itll be up before then
Is the stream still down?

The englishman walks the dog halway over before it farts

Perfson, alot of Russian people end up here, not sure why
Well, the piece of text looked fine to me.
Stream down? Get google internet >:O
I saw it
Headspiner D:
the irishman walks it all the way across before it farts
i work for a oil company
the animation fucking kills me
I read naruto, but I'll never watch the anime.
its soo bad
Nu uh
screw the anime
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xeUWZh7W0o <- 80s
and the australainman walks it all the way over and back before it farts
well they do have deep pockets
ENGLISH DOGFARTS!!! WOOO!
Omfg the Italian opening was mindblowing
the thing is Starflash, I had to remember the entire thing for a test I had in half an hour
I joined early just so I could watch the randomly streamed vids, like I did last week. I had a ball then :P
:)
Hey guys, watch this and if it doesn't make you smile then you have no soul
satirical song about punks
... 6_9
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
now onward to reading
xD
they just bob their heads awkwardly
well we just need to remember were all hooved at the end of each leg
ki
so they ask 'how did you do it?'
@Ryan I KNOW!
be back for the episode
i know the smileys now and i'm gonna use 'em!
yh lol
yeahh- maybe someone will do that today
is that the real opening?
Was it a presentation or something o.o
Every one knows
I don't mind language, if it's me you're worried about. Certain people in my class have very colourful language XD
and he says 'me not stupid me not dumb me stick cork up dogies bum'
i draw schems and do alot of math
I think so!
That's about it
nope Starflash, we had to write an essay
nucking futs!
Im still debating on if I want to wait and see if the live stream is up in 2 1/2 hours... or just sleep...
It is actually, thats just the extended version
So does anyone know when the stream will be up?
ideas?
oh....
Phase4, but... but... a'm ukrainian !! :)
if it was a presentation then I would be horribly screwed
It uses clips from season 2
bubum...... tsch/
what did they use for season 1
the italian version sounded like an anime opening
?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FVqFN_Hn20
Sleep < Ponies
I'll be right back, just looking at the BronyconAU video.
ScootaChicken: why? pronounciation?
its easy and can do it from home
"I watch the others and act like them, I'm a non comformist"
thats the shorter one
Oh and the first two were
Come pick my roses~
eeyup
The way they sang it makes it sound Japanese
LOL
Lawl
because he ran out of juice
omg im getting sick of these links
and because he had no guts
grrrrrr
XD
they are just old
my French pronounciation is really quite lacking
/me dances to some aqua. legit.
but i dabble in stocks
how come the italian version sounds like japanese to me?
lucky
I said they were old
You don't need to click them :p
Perfson, well google tells me that the language is russian
those damn japs are not the only ones with the high pitched girly singing intros
that goes for most languages actually...
jesus... i drop junkmail in letterboxes and am trying to find a better job atm. That's insane how well you're doing
nice
French is pretty easy to pick up in terms of pronounciation though..
Heathrow customs.
they are so inticing!
^ thats why
WATCH THIS LINK AND LAUGH!
Geez how old are you guys? Im 14 and im wondering if theres anyone my age whos a dedicated brony like myself

Mr. epp eh, guitarist went on to form mudhoney I think, and drummer was in Steel Pole bath tub
we westerns can do it aswell
I can speak Chinese fluently, but I still say everything in a really British accent

like i said kids, stay in school
psh, sleep?
Damnit, trixies was there for one episode

Phase4, yes! I use russian language. But i can speak an uk.

I heard the song... several times before...
no idea, but I might want to try and find it. lol
I shat so manty brix when I saw it too
yikes, stocks. that would be a minefield atm given the last few years
SONIC :D BOOM
My favs were stuff like Gun's n Roses, Megadeth and Nirvana.
23
It's something computers do when you push a button.
brb
*le slap*
hello people
shitbrix a mario kart
Ever hear of 'there she is?'
if it makes you feel better i have not slept in 3 days.
it always seems to even out eventually, i always come out on top one way or another
Mainly because that's I know of :P
oye!
hey :)
on newgrounds
Silly computers.
'sup caboose. rvb fan?
ah yeah
Phase4, як справи, мій друг? : D
sigh... great. I'm awake again. I wanna be one of those cool people who oversleep.
what we watching?
well nopony's pushing any of my buttons.
wow an advertisment for a two minute video?
my mother was a huge guns and roses fan
:D
sure am
the fuck?
far out...insomnia?
sorry
im so hungry
Haha, so's mine!
so I grew up with stuff like that in the background
Little Known Fact, when you reach the 48 hour mark of lack of sleep your brain will actually shut itself down conciously, it leads to hallucinations
hey im back
figured lol
Pony cart was so awsome my crome crashed in the begining...
-_- I thought we were discussing video's
hehehe
not your fault
no stress
Is this the " Discord fanclub " Chatroom?
i need to catch up on the most recent season
I feel like some sort of hindu on a fast or something
wat i miss
youtube needs to seriously fix its shit though
my chrome just crashed -.-
yea... very scary stuff happens after 48 hours...
why i watch ponys calms me down
newest season is one of the best
youtube k
I'm back
I feel your pain :(
and yeah I'm not a huge fan but they are good musicians and write good songs
use IE
actually
ep 14 is the best
like... you do stuff that you dont remember doing.
lol
heh heh, us firefox users rule the day!
So I cant say I dislike them
crazy stuff
i guess im the only one then
They did, anyway...
time warps are the most common
ep 14 is top 5 material for sure
I'm convinced that Sleep is actually an elder god bent on slowing human progression and keeping us away from seeing pony episodes.
people have woken up covered in blood that wasnt their own.
I was talking about a small movie and was actually advertising
/me repairs past tense
Perfson, "yak on the right, You're Mine friend?" i think so, yes
kneel before us petty chromeyS!
i got halfway through, but it was my final year of school. havent got back on it
damn opera
scary stuff... O_O
lol Burn
I've been there.
and hey again, rush
Lol.
Indeed!
use opera!
/me is not very good
It's the video uploader's fault for the ads actaully
Phase4:
Personally, I'm not into the screamo, deathmetal music of the 90's/00's
but yeah-
k then. damn it
hey
ohai Poundcake
I got opera aswell
I used firefox until one say it crashed and now doesn't open
ugh
is everybody watching something, cause ill im getting is a loading circle
lol
When your video gets "popular"
Bat Out of Hell is such a stupidly epic song
hi rush how have you been
loading here
as the 90s go, Im into the grunge noise and alternative parts, not the metal really-
I was watching old 80s videos...what did I miss...Im too lazy to read a wall of text :3
Youtube emails you
only one what?
I once had to watch a 10 minute ad for one video
nah im watching the circle
I stayed up for 2 days, and found myself in the bathtub with paint in my ears.
best intro ever
nah, just here for the chat atm
soo fun :P
im using that right now and it doesn't work
gOOD
=I think I'll need to stay up till 4 to watch the new episode -_-
*good
Used FF till it got to the point that it was not usable anymore :/
I mean death cab of cutie is like what I love about the 90s
I agree Rough_Draft, sleep keeps me from ponies, and I must fight it
10 freaking minutes!
oh ok, thought it was just me :P
My friends and i are freaking out
and asks to put ads on your video
damn
i think it's just that till the stream starts
its like a lava lamp :P
as long as you get at least 30 minutes of sleep, you dont get the hallucinations...
why am i seeing black screen
is the video supposed to be loading or?
normally they have something on
use FF for now
want some music? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TzILFK37dc i posted this a few minutes ago

you might feel like a zombie, but at least you wont do anything crazy
streams down
Safari <3
xD
its awsome
?

Curse 'dat Chrome
a live stream of MLP is amazing
arebear. really?
Phase4, u so funny! :D
I was once sick and had to suvive only on applesauce for three weeks. It's a good thing I love applesauce.
not at all
nothing is streaming until 2 hours and 30
opera!
:D
go ahead
Okay
pony_1311 did you see who uploaded that video?
Anyone know of ELO? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RJPaj97H24&feature=player_detailpage#t=5s
and if you want 80s rock in the form of the 90s you can check out things like X Japan and stuff
oki
Oh well, moved on to FF while it crashed >:c
You know Derpy?
Perfson, :)
Phase4, nice google translate?
I don't really like death metal or screamo. If I can't understand words, how am I meant to associate?
i sure has a nice theme on me chrome
twilight room is most mental...so many people
unless the chat explodes and theres lag, then its hell
yes
same here. it's going to be 2 in the morning for me, but so pumped
Perfson, yup
i dont like it on cable it looks off.
Chrome till death ;D
still they could do some preshow entertainment
Thankfully, we've still got quite a few empty token spots on the doom track. Sleep is one heck of a big bad, though. Makes Cultists pretty rough to fight.
hehe
i'm watching minecraft lp
no :( sorry if it was you
Not personally
yup
I like some creamo
i dont know if i can make it to about 2am :P
What if he jumbelled together an arangement of things and crated nyan cat?
just to let you guys know im watching a bunch of Princess Clara videos
or she
heheh yes
pinkie is best pony, though
but eh--I'm not a metal fan anymore
6:31am
Sethisto did
Perfson, what was "yak on the right" actualy suposed to be?
Plus most screamo gets to the emo point.
:'(
just to see how weird it is that she voices Twilight now
lets play a game, I spy with my little eye, something begining with p
So its very hard to relate or like death metal etc
Not if you can fight in your sleep.
Me neither, really.
;_; don't cry fluttershy
pony
Peinis
nope
PC
pinkie is best pony :)
na
So? What do you think?
ELO
potato
nope
Havent hearda lot, but the little ive heard Ive liked
pony_1311?
i love pc.......lucky mac users getting earplugs on tf2
i could see twilight say fuck no
lol :D
...now I really wanna play arkham horror again.
close
its a bummer in Australia and other countries that u have to wait till 2 AM to watch the newest season of MLP
i guess the person that does it went to sleep so no hosting until than
that stress, huh?

True that
ponies*
Phase4, "How are you?"
11.31am, cmon pinkie980 only 2 and a half hourss!\

:[
i normally wait to see it on youtube
What's ur age?
Ware: I think the effects of such an event are pretty obvious... The universe would in on itself and in place of derpy there would be The Heart of Gold
;)
I got a pearcing somwhere on my body, I'll give you a clue, It wasn't on my ear or on my nose, And it was one of my balls
"My Little Bro" ?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKo49rjM8X8&list=FLw_fUbHW-zEXNDPlplXkyKg&index=18&feature=plpp_video pinkie pie dubsteppy stuff

trooper congratz to surviving 18 years! how much longer do you plan on going?
IN
does that count?
But...?

What's everyone's opinion on Dubstep? Both early dubstep, and modern Party-Dubstep.
not really
:| The great and powerful disapproves of you preferring Derpy over the great and powerful Trixie
one*
I hope repony fires me
'cause there was that shitstorm from a few
No, I loved her. Did you?
now tell me where you got it from
hopefully
from outside of this little tree
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrnJJhXZ02Y and suddenly .... APPLEJACK
6_9
The great and powerful Trixie*
in what?
nop, i thought her voice was actually ok and personallity spot on
western canada
into somone's random knee
Twicksee
Adelaide
i loved her too
well i wasnt keen on the voice at the beginning
:P:|
repony: Technically you have the ability, but it is frowned upon
I like skrillex alot- but I prefer his songs like eh Home with friends, glitchy and weird
so I can be more everfree
ooh, JJ posted maid spitfire
twixe
Anything mista dubstep
bad stare
:p
Derpy why do you want to crash me chrome
usa
Teehee
twix
but then i got used to it and now shes sooo awesome!!
yeah
who is the oldest here?
I've only really heard the latter, I think. I don't mind it, it can be good :P
Really? I think that the show did an awfully nice thing to even put her on the show...
18 here
But dubstep in Geeneral has become alittle bit stale-
God
pinkie pie has the most acurate voice in my opnion.
Anything out of UKFdubstep makes me *cringe*
i was just wondering
This is so sweet~: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnsSUqgkDwU&feature=relmfu
dunno about stealing someone's username
19
XD
al;a
What?! Maid Spitfire?! *flies off to DA*
Indiana, USA.
i'm 21
her and fluttershy i reckon
ages?
I want to get into IRL ponies, Ive done pictures, but not videos :c
I love Pinkie's voice too
I think i win
JJ?
i guess if they logged off probably?
Yeah, there's nothing down here...
20
Pinkie has best voice
tyea
I like them all.
23 young boys, just 23 :P
unless they have it registered
I mean...how is this dubstep...? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9h5v5bTRIw&feature=channel_video_title
Also, if they registered, they can kick you off their name at any time and possbly request a network ban since they get a message of who tried to use their name without givign the password
I've never heard deadmau5 but I think its abit too much party for me
flutter and twi have the same voice actor
18
mane 6 are all voiced REALLY well
espically when u brake a pinkie promise
I am REALLY exited for the new episode
flutter your from IN?

tr00per7 You're a two year old embryo
My friends hummed cupcakes as it happened
only thing is, that they document that as a failed login
<----- no ANY friends in real life
I have so many friends... like skippy!
who knew someone who voices pinkie and fluttershy had it in her?
john scares me sometimes
Hmmm... If spitfire is a pony, then what is Messchersmidt?
humina humina humina
Same, in fact all my friends hate ponies and bronies
i mean he's a great artist
i think it was another VA
the server I'm usually in kicks you within 60 seconds
sweet
SKIPPY THE ROCK!
I didn't realise I had so many brony friends
if you don't login properlu
pinkie has only one voice actor
SO MANY FRIENDS.... on the moon...for me
but...so much clop material there, and I don't do that
in my prep school
Where is Adelaide?
Which means I have to keep it secret :(
at all
and system logs the impersonator's IP and shows it to real name holder when he/she logs in
not really hate it here wanna move somewhere better
im back

Ohhhh, ponified Mustang. For some reason, I do want
pssh i converted 3 people already

I want to move to either Louisville KY, Colorado, or maybe Canada.

And it's not working out for them
ive converted 5 people :D
um sure
YAY
Ahahaha, that's like my favourite dubstep song :P
Show a fan fic and some music :D

Dapperjack had an attack underneath the shack, she cried so hard blood fell from her eyes while having a hear attack.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky77aGPpGCI&feature=related <-- great stuff
I converted 0 people
there's the clip. they put something like that "g major" thing on her voice, but apart from that it sounded like normal
d3rb how old are you?
hehe
I was also scared when it did the zoom in thing on Pinkie
24
hi everypony
am i a pretty filly in this?
I tried for ages to make my bass sound like that
bleh not so good off head
I've converted myself
out of 6 attempts
XD
But not enough fuzz or filter pedals
sup
the first step is them admiting it was ok
lol
good evening
wow your as old as my bro
Is there supposed to be a stream up?
converted from people to AVI or mp4 ?)
They should have this emoticon here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsBlQ0gdo5o

Tf2 is alright
Maybe the person running it will fix that soon...
:S
o/

Dapper Jack brisled her Sapphire eyes at her chosen fandom as they swooned over her. She giggled in delight and then decided she would:
I prefer almands
TF2's coo'
i remeber when i watched the season 1 pilot i was like wtf this cant be my little pony XD

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvZoR8yIKkY&feature=fvwp&NR=1
Interesting, thanks ScootaChicken.
Hintedy hint hint.

woo dling hl2
This will always remain my favorite dubstep song of all time: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MEWqx8IKXg
am i the only one who wants to see fluttershy get drunk? or at least tipsy?
i can read and understand this chat, but can't talk (bad english) SOOO SAD
YAY i got respect!
TF2 is a good game indeed
well
lol
TF2 is the #3 video game of all time according to game informer
Xd
Over the barrel was from season one.
I remember my sister watching G3
changed name from (Matthew Lindfield)
I made the mistake of starting to read a star-6 fanfic, it screwed up my schedule yesterday.
^^
Here's an example of early dubstep: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB2tbU_bM8o&feature=relmfu Nothing like what is it now.
im gonna sleep until 9:45...
thanks
Becuase i'm awesome, Everypony should add me
I'm having a cupcakes moment
and I was like "What the hell is that crap"
http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.121202707995995.22602.100003187992265&type=3#!/profile.php?id=100003187992265
I'm from a city south of Sydney
no i fluttershy wouldnt drink i believe
- All under 18s must be accompanied by an adult (ideally a parent, guardian or older sibling), and will need to leave the pub by 10pm
which is the main reason I hesitated :)
ok take care:P
yeah, probably not
/me flies around
so it's probably not a good idea
lol
Someone called Pinkie Pie
sounds like fun
anyone here play dragon nest or vindictus? just wondering...
i'd recommend a good book then
lucky. here its 4:40
theres a fanfiction where twilight gets drunk
I should go
Ah yeah, I remember that soortof--my friend liked it
john dies at the end
Huh. Atm seems a lot more basic.
Ouroboros, I'm friends with the people in charge of it and there's already been a fairly successful meetup in Trafalgar Square
To london
Anyway, bye.
pinkie would, wonder what sorta drunk she would be?
I used to play Vindictus Beta
Just for that day.
fanfic :/
maybe she'll tun into fluterbitch if she drinks
2:40
11:10pm
Eeyup
lots of freaky shit in that
Shrimp3000, later
yeah-
What was everyponys childhood game?
But then I got some other game
please
its 6:41am
I'm only 14, which is gonna cause some difficulties
YES DRAGONS NEST
i playin DnD in IRL
this is next week
http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6856543/1/What_do_you_do_with_a_drunken_unicorn
I forget the name
waaah
pinkie pie can't get drunk
Someone does something good someone has to do it better
4:41 am
Childhood?
Not specifically cupcakes
not enough time
Shrimp AWAY!
yeah
Yes
the first Halo
I'm not that messed up
However there is a level to where something can only be so good
One fine Saturday... I was bored stiff. So I browsed YouTube. Then I saw a TV episode. I was like "Hell, why not?" And I watched it. And suddenly, my whole world exploded with joy and laughter. And I watched the entire season 1 in 2 days <3
Um. Simpsons hit and run
or really pinkie-sh and excitable
Darn.
once it reaches that
There's a fanfic where Rarity gets drunk and kisses Applejack... It was.... strange.
how so?
although I think the person I'm going with is over 18
just mostly gore
Diable 2 was the first game it got in to <3
the shes to drunk on joy to notice.
/me pokes Derpy_Hooves
everyone that tries to be better then that simply fails
Donkey Kong 64.
Diablo*
Oh yeah
BRB
okay I think I blacked out somewhere... What fic are you talking about?
I forgot Diablo
although I'm not sure...
I tried playing warhammer in real life till I realised my family cant play warhammer and the damn instructions is like a few inches thick
and maybe a gun or two
/me wonders when a meet up will happen in Anchorage AK?
spyro the dragon
lol true.
That's one of my faves
Huge child safeguarding issues if you dont do something like that derpy_pony, better than just banning under 18s outright.
Cupcakes somewhat
1:41pm
Diablo 2
Xd
im not that keen on shipping fics
For the life of me I can't find where this topic started
ScootaChicken, would you happen to be using xchat?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEWJ32ZF2i0&feature=related First dubstep ive ever heard
SPYRO!
No question about it
Mine was Rayman, If you've heard of it?
Anyway, this "old" dubstep ain't bad.
xchat?
Yeah
o no... Molestia...
yes, sure, Ouroboros
that was the first game I ever bought for my PS
and I kept repainting the damn space marines red and blue till they were just a mess
I wrote a random poem for dapper

ScootaChicken, nvm then, its an irc client
Rayman was pretty good, Sktismore!
At the Winter Gala

No arrows or knees here, Spotty.
I would talk about skyrim, but too much danger of getting shot by arrows

awkward quietness

Neither am I
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo8awujLA1Q&feature=bf_next&list=PL3551304C11D8F6EC&lf=plpp_play_all

and a little hypo
oh god, reading that linked one later
It was, But nopony played it
anyone notice the lack of male ponys that talk
I'm old enough to be prime minister anyway...so it's not really my problem
/me backs away from Molestia
ScootaChicken, ah, it does the same as xchat when you autocomplete
It's epic as fuck nao
I do
puts a , after the name
Eeyup :D
eyyup

Huh, in sweden, pretty much every had Rayman 2 o_o
And yet, I stay still at the computer...
/me appears behind String_Shredder
Helloooooooo

:( um... well... I like... Sonic the Hedgehog... and stuff but if you don't approve, that's fine by me...
Bronies
your brain isn't such a weird place after all
No, you hunt noobs
Dapper awoke from his bed to watch the next episode form my little pony only to see a discord icon on his screen
"Linux 3.2.1-1-ARCH [x86_64/1.20GHz/SMP]"
Oh come on oldies are the best. *Puts on hipster glasses* Like the xcom series, old adventure games like Loom and the Secret of Monkey Island.
...so to answer your question I don't know
Pegasus

He assumed he had a virus so tried to close it
again
Earth ponies!
XD

Bronies

However a magical portal of magicalness appeared and he was sucked into the world of my little pony
like me
ME

:[ 2006 SONIC WAS AWFUL, JUST AWFUL
he sucked in
Sonic Generations is boring
I drew fanart
I used to play pokeymans, but then I got bored and stopped :3
man call of duty is sweet, its a brillaint game. My favourite was cod 3, I loved playing that game with the tanks and motorbikes
the video was heaps scary
oh god
I'd like to hear Glitch Rock music, but no one seems to make it. Every time I search for it, I get results about some Black Ops rock glitch.
red delicious, pink lady, fuji, honeycrips, gala, braeburn, mcintosh, jazz...
:trollface: action 52
is the video playing for u guys?
Anypony else find Call of Duty overrated?

but I am still creeped out
never played sonic games!
I'm sixteen and a cynical bastard
yes
and action 52
Extqatic and thuroughly feaked out, he headed to Twilightws house to find only Flutterbitch residing
it was fucked up, but i think i'm too desensitised from horror movies to call myself "scarred"
:'( But I like Sonic Generations
And apperently 6 months can do that to a person~
Overrated = bad?
Gilda deserved it though

cheetamen
"Oh boo hoo"
eeyup
Did you know that there is an Xcom remake in the wroks?
Im 12, what is this?
ScootaChicken, what age do you turn cynical?
hehe
2 hours
Glitchy rock music?
Cupcakes wasent so bad to me, creepy, but not scary
Haha, CoD.
oif any1 got a coppys of those games ill buy them
True that
Ye
She replied to his questions
and 15 minutes
sounds like a good idea
original sonics are best sonics
Aw :(
I'm not fond of CoD or Battlefield
I'm a cynical optomist
but poor Twist :(
Arebear: Lol
no, no she didn't
if I wanna play an FPS, it's Quake.
i am going to fucking make it
did anyone see that video with the dancing?
What u talk1ng b0ut dud3 c0d is S1CK
Dapper is stuck in Equestria, how will we talk with him?
Phase4, 13 and 3 quarters, I'm 14 now
yes
you could check out avant garde, no wave, noise and stuff though
yeah my boyfriend said that he got scared of cupcakes more than saw
random chat is random
'cause i found that disturbingly hilarious
some of that is glitchy
through telekinesis
the 100% cleaner version
14 and a half actually...
hahahaha ^
Remember when I said that if something is good
However suddenly Rainbow dash came in and put a rin on her, quickly followed by rainbow jack.
:D LOL CoD is sick, you so random CanadianSinna
I GOT AN ORIGINAL ATARI 2600 IM 14 SCREW GREAT GRAPHICS
the song is great
if i want to play a FPS i play halo combat evolved or half life 2
No
Gta 2 on PS1 or War of the mosters on PS2... good times.
and it someone perfects it
DapperJack: Telepathy?
random for the random god?
May I have a link?
Let's put a smile on dat faec.
*Yeah, I'm not too fuzzed about it, though, justwannahavefun. It feels like it's gonna be more like Mass Effect or something rather than Xcom
what ever happened to megaman?
"Just how in tarnation did you get out of that cage missy?"
the song is pretty cool
ScootaChicken, huh, i'm 18 and that never happened. i must be broke
a computer
yup
then others try and fail. This was the guy that perfected it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8xmjh_H9Mno
Everything else falls short, we get it.
megaman is hard shit
probably.
is anyone seeing nothing?
Lol
Megaman was good
I think you mean telepathy Dapper. Telekenesis wouldn't be very helpful
Telekinesis is moving distant objects
"Bitching, I borrowed pinki pie's abilities
Megaman got cancer and died :(
and my perfected, I mean created the dirtiest drop of all time
"
lol
the video is flagged
im 16
:(
shit as in good sorry
Did anypony have muppet racing?
Awkward silence XD
:D :S
the dancings awsome
Oh
hehe. telekinesis...
It's another 2 hours yet
but the best of by the best isnt always the best
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn81P8ihsOw hope you know what you're getting into, rush. its very graphic
yeah i form words in the show
Heath Ledger died :(
mind you, ever since I became a brony I've become a lot less pessimistic
Cool
stupid little kid took too many plasma bullets to the cranium
really? flagged?
anypony here from the bioware pony thread?
Wait, there are 2 Xcom remakes WIP.
especially in art and music
and you guys watch it and respond
Is anyone getting anything to show up on the stream?
This makes Fluttershy sad.
ponies tend to do that
No, the only racing games I have is Burnout and f1
using branches etc
the song is great
heath legend what when
eeyup
I can be an optimist and cynical
:(
good, make fluttershy sad
True
arcadian nope, im blind as buck
Keep up the optimistic work! :3
/me hides under random bed "Molestia cant find me here"
NO
she doesnt deserve happiness!
Oh? I didn't knw about the second one
look at the countdown
With Art, it's pretty opinionated.
same guy that did party hard :D
people keep calling me pinkie pie because of the way i act :$
Hi Guy's
but just listen to the drop
yeah-
weres dah music?
love the song, love the dancing, hate the rest
before you say that
who jacked my name?
;P
I'll brace myself xD
Then again... A pessimist to an optimist is a realist...
oh, I see
Can you believe this shit
Thuroughly confused, Dapper stood there and managed to ask "What the hell is going on" Ensuring not to go down to flutterbitch's lever with swearing
Chat..going...so...fast....
Waiting...
fluttershy is best <3
Cynicisim is a mental tap to show your level of empathy
I used to like Megaman... then I took a Capcom to the knee ;)
I like to think I'm a realist
100% clean version http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfNXme3vqs
omg ponies in almost 2 hours!
pretty glitchy
Oh
))
anypony from the bioware my little pwny thread?
in the knee*
/me is hiding under the bed already
best i can come up with for me is "optimistic pragmatist"
I can't watch it XD
the video playing for u guys?
its just the song
there you gom take the above link
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggQKO8-u1a8&feature=g-like&context=G29cbb2aALTyN3aAAHAA
Flutterbitch broke free and smached Dapper, and anyone else who was actually reading this to the end
:|
but it could have been dirtier in myyy mind
Fazana shut up :S
Nothing on the stream yet.
O S:OT
Stream is down
k
Hey, where'd Molestia go?
but not a "pragmatic optometrist"
Optimistic cynical nihilist

BIOWARE

They shoud make 8h long video with eps to just throw on stream before new ep :3
idk cant really say
It's annoying that ot's overused, but putting the joke wrong is even more annoying IMO
i'm getting nothing from the stream, what's goin' on?
dohoho
well i still liked it
/me runs around in circles "she cant hit a moving target!"
pony gore is wrong
Hi everypony

48% cynical
/me hides behind String_Shredder
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmLwFWc5gMU

arcadian the thing's been down for the last hour or so, bad things r ahead
And pinkie's my favorite, but they all kick ass.
Hi
im torn between fluttershy and pinkie pie
LOOK AT ME I'M A TARGET!
you know in all honesty im starting to wonder if there is some intrinsic magic per each race of pony
amras
You should read mutations, much better and only thrice as confusing
/me does something else
Derpy broke it
XD
I laughed dohoho the other day and got patted on the head.
i used to derp then i took a muffin to the knee :P
look at me im a gun
how was your sleep?
bang bang bang bag
Hi all
pony gore is discusting and creepy :/
hey bronypony talk
i mean all unicorns can use telekenesis right?
I used to make bad jokes.... but then i took a mace to the face. True story
I watched the clean version (I can't watch the other) and it's hilarious.
same but bigmacintosh too
and if we take the heart warming eve to be canon
if we're going for oxymorons...
Has anypony played super meat boy before?
I had a pleasant dream
but youre still making them...
Yes
i used to make arrow to the knee jokes...then i stfud.
Inquisitor, be you... By the Emperor...
excellent
http://puppytwister.com/
i used to occupy canterlot then i took a mace to the face
it booted me then stole my name wrong so wrong
actually no, what I was about to say is quite offensive
notice rainbow has no wings the second dance time
its not gore
/me takes a few steps shyly towards the corner.
I finished it ^_^
i'm loving AJ because she needs it so much :)
i think earth ponies have the power to break the forth wall more than any other race
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!
they can all use telekinesis because they had to unify their abilities to move the sun and moon
BANZAAAA
*closes eyes* sounds like some fucked up porno
rain fire and death upon the enemy!
Um... If we're talking about fics and all...
I actually somehow managed to complete it
but all of them are awesome
It's time for everyponies favorite part of the brondcast, and I'm talkin' about RADIO GRAFITI!\
thar are bad puns that you giggle at and then theres aweful puns taht you want to bury in the backyard

Exterminatus by the Spanish Inquisition?
Would you like to read my fic?

I love AJ.

No-wave came from musicians, especially jazz people who were sick of music
Sure!

Bit late, but it took time to find links:

I think--the animation and detail in mlp is OUTSTANDING- and the humour dont make me cringe
Sup
Nostalgia trip?
Gait is a pronk.
Pinkey can really bounce that quick?
Pinkies been on the crack
Hey

Hello.
i think its more like 6bits
Moar adds.
hello
glad to help
well it's good anyway
Hi
16
I hope they do. Just so we can have more Derpy lines.
cMornin' P0n-3
that plus the adoreableness and message makes it awesome
Who knows the name of this video?
sleep? people still do that?
pinkie on trampoline is cutest pinkie :P
more ADHD
Are some people seeing a stream or did I miss a link?
Hey P0n-3 ~
same
hm, you have a point there vivix
I think I had a good idea for a fic with a friendship lesson. If any writers are in here and are drawing a blank for synopsis, message me. :)
inb4 Dr.Rockso.
I rarely sleep now.
@fazana, pinkie can bounce at near light speed.
Same Vivix. I started for the humour, stayed for the HNNNNG
"Who's the president?" And then it shows three pictures.
I am willing to put a bet that we will have a Bic Mac talking surprise(this episode or next)
might be hard to tell
oh god i got disconnected
I just can't
octopus project truck
Are all the pre ep videos usually this awesome? (first time livestreamer)
hey i have that

Refresh your browser Brusselsprout
yeahh
*sigh*
by the looks of it.
True
I'll sleep when I'm dead
That, or Vinyl.

Like Derpy last week
thanks
there we go
Unless they're G1 ponies.
Pretty awesome PMV.
the back drum and guitar are realass hell :D
well...(long typing give it a sec)
Then it's just sad.
Chiptune is more accurate, there's bass and acoustic drums but yeah
I remember people telling me I had no sould for not being overjoyed at the concept of Pinkie Pie multiplying herself and creating a pink party army.
i was in the wrong chat
great game play it
So is this a direct steam or just a steam of a steam?
I wonder if derpy will be in this episode?
I just started staring at my pinky pie toy
i did that once
Yeah I know
So, do you think we're gonna have another derpy scene?
HYYYYYEEEEESSSSSSS
no walking, she only humps the air to get a ride
But that was Pinkamena diane pie
And then Pinkie Pie appears, dressed as an old West prostitute.
good morning (time 15:14)
I take everasl small 2 hour naps throughout each day as to maximize my internet time.
and now my screen pesters me about getting an australian passport. why would I want that?
Hopefully :(

Is ToR still down?
YAY

I guess
evening
Hello fellow bronies!
Is this just the place where fans go to share wingboners on Episodes?
I'm gonna put so many hours into that game
If I were Discord, I would give entire schools of students the iron buttocks of Derpy. Imagine the cost
Jean is from Australia

Sounds awesome Winter!!!!
XD
Yep
yeah but all the good pony games seem to never be finished

for
I'm public with it
sorry, im just saying, try reloading or something
whos streaming?
Except if you don't make sense in which case the sense makng is senselesss and such other senseless talk stemming from a single senseless sentence
just watch out for when something potentially contraversial happens.
phew
the chat
I meant the lat one, thanks
oh, wow, I'm not the only person on the planet who still knows about GW2.
blows
UP
You know... I've always thought it would be kind of awkward to have a party without competitive video games like super smash brothers to keep us occupied...
Same
JAYDEN
GUYS
GUYS
I just don't rub it in everyone's faces
I AM YOUR VIRGIN NOW BRING ME YOUR GODS!

GW2 FTW

Friendship is witchcraft?
Friendship is Witchcraft!
8D
IT'S SO CUTE
Livestream didn't crash. But the chat was veeery slow.
CUTE
Would you guys help me beat up Dumbell and his crew?
CUTE

Yes, yes it is
kool, still going to be F2P?

Eee hee hee hee! I think I'll steal some of Octi's Jura to celebrate the new episode. :D
haha sick
ok from the latest episode im assuming that her time portal
I've only told 1 friend
catchy
:$
It will even be worth the bruises.
Yesssss this song
It is now
IKR
Now it's gonna be stuck in my head all day
is brining back people from the dead
So friendship is witchcraft is the Yugioh abridged of MLP?
bit of sarcasm there...
Pinkie invented it
I saw the reactions to Derpy it was hilarious.
<3
wait there's going to be a contest
I love the song but can't stand the vocals in this. They're VERY nasal.
going to my LOL wrecking folder
She be messin' up time.
I hope if someone is videoing this chat that I can see myself at one point
yep
and it has 6 out of 9 done?
All my friends know, but theyre not bronies so I dont talk about it to them alot
SQUEEE
awsome
exept
She was messing with time so yeah.
I need to train my voice to do my little pony characters.
better yet mare, what if she TALKS?
witchcraft? HERESY!
it is better
i've got this and the firday polka on my ipod, have been meaning to get sweetie's race song
>.>
:P
...brains...
love friendship is witchcraft <3
almost as good as sweetie bot, but not quite =P
lol it's a Derpy's voice!
friendship is witchcraft.
Pinkie... Pinkie everywhere.
They day I downloaded adblock was only topped by the day I stoped using IE
Darn, that's one thing I don't have.
my friend has never seen an episode of the show and he hates it
to brink back parents or sometin
not pinkie
letm e guess between the cider 900 thing and applejack
awesome
pinkie sounds wierd
since it has an actual plot
FUCKING COMMERCIALS!
o3o
duh
Its the extended song from when she and apple bloom use gypsy magic to make a time portal
...What am I watching, and why is it so great?
Ah, i c. Thx :)
My video isnt working
I'm trying to get him to watch 1 episode, but he won't. That and he called me gay D:
you should tell everyone ^^
00,10I dont like having the video name in the player it messes up the aspect
i dont like it
I like her voice, personally...
i dont have a IRL brony, only a hoeny
*friday, lol can't type
I remember the livestream crash when Find a Pet was sung for the first time.
This sounds like TGAP Trixie
:3
I hated it too
*sigh* Why oh why must Pony start when I head into work?
The Derpy reactions slowed everything down. XD
ZombiePony: *cocks shotgun*
i though the abridged version was the mentally advanced series
I saw what happened in here last week
what a douuche
wana know why i think applejack is one of the coolest ponies? her voice actor loves the flash apple.mov
/me is back
what is she making?
hmm, she not canon in this episode probably, maybe just cameo
I'm not missing it again
XD
'
O hai
/me wants to murder ad's
Derpy sounded odd aswell
one of my friends who i got to watch it did not like it at all
:P
time sourve
It's just how we're brainwashed
A time portal
hey!
453 users
I had some hard cider but I drinkded it.
this is my favorite song thats playin right now
mentally advanced is my favorite
hehehe
Helo everypony!
it needs some cleaning but i can do that myself
Sumica: *Points at SB*
everypony - 1.30 min to go grab some snacks!
call in sick, i'm going to
what ads?
I agree, it's a nice voice, but it is slightly weird
i mean it's not for everyone
wb
the anti 4th wall
where ar u guys on im lost cause of reading an article
00,10But this video is Pinkies Brew incase you could not tell
so, what time is it where you are?
that's why i'm here, shamus
*cough*
(shes my age and tomboyish so it sorta counts)
yo gi oh abridged goes along the storyline of the original and makes fun of stuff
That would have been perfect, I should have had some of the other stuff.
hmm
(hi Dr. nick)
Omg I love this song
lolwut
adds
ADBLOCK
lol
I hate the ads aswell
And SAVED the cider.
That too. But Friendship is Witchcraft is really good as well.
Tychus_Findlay: Dayum Fame.
She baked the fourth wall
derpy sounded odd cause the VA thought she was a guy
but i have to admit the witchcraft one does a better storyline
lol yeah, i don't see what buisiness a dj would have at a farm
wait; when is the episode? Ten?
/me moves next to Molestia "wanna go to the moon? ;)"
while this creates it's own plot
USE ADBLOCK
I cant see anything]
but to dislike it purely based off what you know of the previous generations without watching g4, is kinda silly
*facehoof*
Still adorable
This is where the derpy shitstorm happened?
Yeah this show isnt for everyone but, none of my friends hate it
:(*
How DO you cook a portal?
#bronystates
Can't use chrome
Gameman246, I know the feel bro. In fact, I'm watching this while that dude is right next to me (unknowing of what I'm watching)
yes
yeah
apple bloom may have burnt her muffins but her sister got pinkie sick
I decided to watch it anyway though, after seeing some pony vids and being confronted with bronies on tf2

This song is so cool!
the stars will aid in her escape is better than this =P
They aren't very good in gneral, this is one of their better songs
*soft headbnag*
Not a portal. I know a portal is just the things to travel through time or somehin?
If nothing else; this video is held up by the epicness of 'This is War' xD
Who keeps posting videos I like! How do you knoooooow!

What's this video?~
i like some really weird music so whatever
