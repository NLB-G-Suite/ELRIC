i read all the rules and OMG NETFLIX
THERES MOVIES ON DERE I HAVE IT TOO
03oh, any apps you install yourself are stored in data/app
03opposed to system/app which is the non-removable apps that come iwth eit

dat song
that the room reference
omagod lol
Im' lsitenignt o 2112
Default ringtones are not affected by factory reset?
03right.
same with default apps
?
03right
k
Then I can get rid of lolSuperuser
It's stuck there
03nope
03superuser is in system
03I was just about to mention that
The Terminal disappeares
:<
I've been to Arcadia at MOntreal
once
I've been to whole night events but that's different.
but
03you can delete apps from it (like the bloated crap that comes with the phone), as well as add things that aren't affected by resets
she can't root
03superuser is stored in system
03she can't root because you screwed something up :P
and that was just before the wii released
03the guides are pretty simple
uh
I read all the guides
and the phone
yea, there's that too lol
is like nearly unrootable
I know I'll be going at Videogame live at the end of october
03there's an exploit...
Yes
sucks
03it has nothing to do with the phone company
too bad no conventions are held in hungary, ever...
DRF
You try to root her phone
03I offered
Do it
03:P
Sky
let him root it
That Dracula reference
or try to root
it was boss
but
And if it breaks my phone?
it didn't work
03as I was going to say, there's only one proper way to completely reset a phone, including removing superuser and all that
still didn't give me the root uid
03and that's flashing the firmware.
no
bobs burgers..
And if rooting breaks my phone?
Cuz it's had glitches, as I've said
awwww yeah Bob's Burgers time!! :)
03if I can find a firmware flasher
Didn't have them before
03it can fix it
ON NETFLIX
03I won't try unless one exists
03Motorola uses .sbf files, other companies use other things
and it has no commercials on netflix :D

03you might know how to fix this
Do you have a soundblaster 16?
03the BIOS is stupidly old
03and refuses to see anything over 8GB
03so it thinks my 40GB hard drive is only 8
03well
lol
03will ignore the BIOS
03so when I installed XP on there, it shows all 40GB
03but 98 uses the BIOS information for hard drive sixe :/
03*size
03any idea how to bypass that? LOL
damn
hm
I swear I had a 10GB drive in 98
but that was VMed
03oh, the OS itself supports it
03it's the installer that uses the BIOS
03I dunno if I can use something like Parted Magic
03to enlarge the partition
I swear this computer hates me today. It was fine yesterday.
!
lol
dat bomb
wtf derpy <.<
03hm

Bronysith..really thats not needed
all he has to do it land...
00,10it is all wing
00,02Shamroc, allso i drove up stairs
Land.... PFFFFT
He might actually make this...
00,10and it's realy light once it's out of fuel
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2495/
It's seemed like it...

Ohhhhh!

HE DID IT!? WAHAHAAAAAAT?!
*eats my cat*
/me omnoms on bag of cheetoes
00,02Sumica, i am impressed
/me eats a matter wave hat
Waaait
is this Sea Ponies I hear?
and now there is a line acroos half of my drawing ....
It's not the first time he's landed this plane.
And then it explodes
/me ejects
00,10and now a 24km taxy home
damn it, i hate it when all the TF2 servers I go to are full
00,02why wont it stop?
DON'T change the design
00,10they never invented breaks and it's on a hill
Sumica's like, "Sod it I'll drive it to the airbase"
And then he crashes it
00,10them too
Nopony remembers I was gone.... :'( :'(
00,02Sumica, i'd recomend changing the engines on the wings, those are 175 thrust while the good turbo's are 150 and use bugger all fuel
lol
You're picking up speed...
And then he drives into the sea and they all die.
20 bits he crashes it anyway
I'm pretty sure this song is a remix of Sea Ponies. :P
hiya guys
00,10needed the thrust vectoring to get the nose up
https://p.twimg.com/Awwd00oCQAA2n_K.jpg
00,02Sumica, all the turbojets have vectoring
That's the second episode
Hey otakon!:P
inb4 he cant stop and hits a building
This is gonna END GUUUUD
how do I know it's the second episode
00,10and they die out at 10km
His design is Concorde with booster rockets
00,02true
Dat AlexS remix :3
00,02but you burn a lot of fuel before 10km
Dat chute.
00,10hell of a tailwind
This is gonna take a while
Steer to the right...
He might just make it
/me 00,02is still figuring how to use turbo's on takeoff
00,10I did't add an ejection to them
derp
Where I can find this music? What's it called?
Lets just say he crashed
More people need to know about JayB's amazing remixes

Saturn: VOCAROO!

inflation you scary...
00,10Serise
D-Day was a clusterfuck, which mainly suceeded because the operation was pulled off in a way that fooled the Germans worse than it fooled the Allies.
Monte Casio was a rough battle
^
into France.
http://i.imgur.com/iFPA8.jpg Oh wow
The allies were already in Italy
D-day was essentially this: "THROW ALL THE TROOPS AT THE BEACH!"
wow...
D-Day was when the american troops arrived on the french coast, yes
XD
*long
...troops
00,10Which troops?
Welp. I gotta go now. BYR EVERYPONY! :)
ALL OF THEM
CARRRRROOTTT TOPPP
boohoo
it's the THREESOME
Since I've been here, do you know our news?
one of my history teachers in high school told us a story about how the Allies put inflatable tanks and ships at the point nearest to south Britain which moved the Nazis to that location, leaving Normandy beaches a mere fraction of the force it should have been
It was hinted at in our previous conversation
or rather the Nazis planned
those trading cards seem pretty cool
I want the one with Time Turner
Hu
Yup, Patton's inflatable army
what`s this?

00,02Sumica, actualy never mind
hot hot pony!! http://imgur.com/gallery/o3AJO
00,02my fuel tanks drained unevenly
00,02why did they do that
I always find it frustrating how people forget the french resistance, those people never surrendered, and sacrificed a lot, especially considering this was THEIR country they saw getting destroyed by the nazis
http://lilmisswaffles.deviantart.com/#/d55l05r
00,10use only one or flip one of them over to prevent the torque issue
00,02Sumica, i didnt
if i rember correctly werent these planes built to lose even an entire wing section and still fly?
Not everyone..
02Formulated does have its benefits though. Like when you’re in public
02|D
00,10they also can tow a glider behind them
yep
00,02O_O
10Pfft

00,02no warning, just pop
12this is all
00,10er torqued
breastfeeding is free.
just saying
Part2 noaw!
the Polish resistance was great too but couldn't win
00,02wasnt moving fast
02yeah
I had the same issue with my mini-shuttle.
lotsa planes 0.0
The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people march with you
saves the parents lots of money in the end
:p
Aww
The entirety of europe resisted and sacrificed, but we only remember the winning soldiers from d-day
02And it’s more sanitary
The logic being that any parts that WERE damaged were areas that could be hit and still allow the plane to function.
02for the baby
I swear there's more to that speech then was shown
well this was the war when we did our most ssupport to any way ever if i do remember it well bu then again i may be wrong
00,10but it was a long speach
*clop* Nice movie, even for 1942 standards...
is this all for the 4 of july?
woot! Anthology 2!
it's pinkie logic, but it's brilliant pinkie logic
Part 2 next plz :)
America FUCK YAH

meh, just felt like it
I liek trains 2OO!
What's this? We seeing a random unannounced movie?
2OO
there IS a reason WWI was originally called "The war to end all wars"
[][ooo][ooo] choo choo
At the time it was called The Great War.
i meant the adult derpy XD
*jigsaw's mask*
I like games
all thats left is : clestia (surprised no pony had the guts to try and take her)
Rain: oh, I know, but at the time it was easily the most savage war anybody had seen. They kind of thought that this one would...scare us off of doing it again.
lol
we are too head strong for that
Little did they know: we'd eventually put sanctions onto Germany that would lead to Hitler's rise to power in germany
and then, after WWII, we placed MORE sanctions on germany...which led to the cold war.
he killed a sergeant
did he stab him?
Yes
At least WWI wasn't as harsh to civilians as WWII; with deatch camps, carpet bombings and penal batallions raping, murdering and pillaging everything on their way
Damn....
Which led to the whole issue in the middle east we've been dealing with for 11 years now.
Where is this going RAWRirty?
stop talking about history

it's a trap!
don't go soldier
