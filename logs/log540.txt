Tank for president?
There's a Youtube comment on the vid asking for Anthology III, and it already has 12+ thumbs up.
Supported.
It hasn't even been long enough for someone to have watched the whole video yet.
The Anthology || is almost and hour and 1/2 long! :o
It was available at 2:00, and I started within five minutes of that mark. >_>
And am not even halfway done.
Ponies47 does this mean that if they do make a new one every season they'll be one at least half a day long
lol
Dem commercials
alexxm: HA@ Yeah 12 hours of the Anthology :P
Hey, ZephyrStar cheated! He commented on the vid 2 days ago!

LilB: call in monopolizing
midnight run was the only other stream, they had to cancel

What for?
the anthology is better a bit after the mid point
What is Pinkie Pie going to do WITH ALL THE GOLD?
ThatGui: poor audio/video quality apparently, couldn't get their tech to work
Vacation_Wrek thats bad... bacause the stream on everyfree isn't working... grrr...
TANK 4 PRESIDENT
CrimsonPhoenix perhaps that was their plan all along
still no bronycon?
what if Bronycon exploded?
well, everfree is taping it I would assume, though their internets are teh suck
John Lennon + Applebloom........
Vacation_Wrek: I see. I'm on vacation as well. I'm really bored. :/

i hope EFR will stream smoothly wile de Lancie
DUSTY!!!
ohai Dusty
DUSTY!
dat waxed head
RD said G1 is SO. AWESOME?..........OK.:)
no idea why it would be so delayed. it's just a BS mod watching the same livestream and then streaming it to us yeah... ? it looked iike 3-4 minutes behind
13phase is in australia
13packets take a nonzero amount of time to travel that distance and back
Well, coincidentally the stream comes back up again for the next panel.
ah, that would do it
Shizuka: i don't think it's that cuz mips is about 15 minutes behind
Ohai Shizuka :)
Well, at least John De Lancie is next.
13because after all mips NEVER has problems..
all right I'm at 1:00:00 mark
Pinkie Pie went all Stewie.........''I DON'T LIKE CHANGE''
pause for Delancie
I'm back. Hory Shet guys, they made the stream work just in time to talk to Dusty. :P

THE TROTTO
Ponies47: what r u talking about?
Nah. I'm just quoting :P
Still is mediocre.
THR TROTTING DEAD*
but after mid mark it's getting decent for me

That's right, Dusty is so manly that the stream fixed itself for him. :P
ponies47 is quoting anthologies 2... it's been on and off. some stuff I like and a lot of references I'm missing =/
You guys now by now I'm s very silly filly :P

They are switching to the other camera.
Touch filly, get silly.

AgentKalim: Sounds.....odd? :O

Kandarihu http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA&feature=player_embedded
Brony kindness FOR THE WIN!
it's a bit odd that half of us watches the EFR stream live and the other half waches it with 15 minutes delay
03god dang it Verizon
03they have this "share everything" plan that looked good, but it says right in the FAQs that you lose unlimited data
03>_>
are they setting up
?
It freezes alot
.-.
OH YAH YOU GOT SWAG SON

/me wishes she could reach out and brohoof him
Kandarihu sounds like my kind of man
Oh man, he even has the comercial voice
Soooo manly
mishia which stream are yuo watching?
Weird. It's lagging a lot on the Livestream page and on BS it's not even moving an inch
Rainbowdash
AttackWithHugs: Yeah it is, but try deleting your cache then refresh.

I don't have lag
LUCKY
Well I'm getting ALL the lag.
btw, Phase4's computer might shut down soon
no lag 4 me :)
days of our lives, no cheers. star trek, all the cheers.
no lag for me, thats unusual
Chrysalis it normaly shows the buffering circle when its on my end, it just had a hick-up and showed 2 sec, but its freezing again
Dken2021: Why?
I'm not getting buffering, just lag. :P
I wonder what this anonymous show is?
delancie is going all BLARGHAHRGHA
Dken2021 any idea why and how do you know this
AttackWithHugs he left it on and saud it's set to shut down after four hours
Dken2021: Ok
Little girls on motorbikes?
thanks Dken2021
Anyone else's stream blacking and coming back?
damn it all
i have to download it off origin
meh
livestream loves me...
and yet he did a documentary anyway
Dken2021, he's DOING like right now
Livestream loves me too.
Seriously, I don't want to bitch, but I'm getting lag every few seconds.
Tassadork: I sense sarcasm
Storms outside ;_;
no. the stream on everfree's website hasn't skipped once
well every pony i have to go to bed
I guess some will have to watch via livestream
goodnight
goodninght RainBowJack
this is the one in NY right
Omg!! :D
Tassadork: It keeps skipping for me. It blacks and then it comes back with lag. I already cleared my cache and deleted all cookies so I don't know what it is.
take THAT MSNBC
hmm, I wonder?
and everyone knows what hes talking about ^^
lols
clap clap clap
2Gtg..nice talking to you again :)
/me applauds
NPR is indeed an embarassment
AttackWithHugs: close and restart browser, to open some ram?
AttackWithHugs: Much of the same, except it doesn't even black out. It just freezes.
FOX44
AgentKalim: Hmm..I'm gonna try on Chrome because firefox is not agreeing with this
bye RainBowJack
did anything interesting happen?
I don't even have Chrome, just Firefox
Howdy
john is moderating his own panel ^^
apart from the fire and the anthology 2? :D
Tara is Queen
hopefully there's somewhat of a community after the show dies down a bit
John is King
I find that Chrome is more cooperative with some stuff than Firefox. Livestream is one of them.
What're we watching?
Alchemist they're just setting the next panel up i think
and Lauren is god
he has SO much god damn power right now
CrouchingApples: BroNYcon
Ah,
Swell.
CrouchingApples: John de Lancie is up right now
I want that pinkipie.
Right now.
he just realised what he did
shouldn't have said that. now he's got a fence
he now has SO many fences
And then he had a fence
probably many fences. all of them beautiful
What'd he do?
with heart patterns
Fences?
inb4 discord and fence pic
Dammit, Chrome!
AttackWithHugs when asked what did he want bronies to do, he joked fix his fence
then realised just WHAT he did
inb4 delancie fence kickstarter
^

Fences > Railings
Ah,

John de Lancie's fence > any other fence
De Lancie is godWINNING
I bet when he gets home his fence is done

derpy_pony what and how?
Invi I used TOR to get around it... I think its because of the Amanamaguchi song at the beginning :(
Lil_B we need a Dan vs GEMA
Invi: google is your friend. you get one for less than $5 per month...and you can even pay with bitcoins
03OK, some people
Invi "Oh a funny Video from germany... Blocked by GEMA?" "GEEEEEMMMMAAAAAAAA!!!!!"
SMB or File Manager?
or...just google for "youtube proxy"
I'm suspecting Anamanaguchi is all confused about the pony comments they're getting right about now

Alas, youtube is disappoint
Not...ruined, lol :D
Lil_B: lol
icybeauti: It's all that trying to type as fast as possible. :D
"It's all ruined" *flips table*
omg I want that RD SOOOOOO BADDD!!! :(
icybeauti: you english worst on this site as well
Only found one video of bronycon june 2012, and it was fan made :p
derpy hooves u added me yet?
I see Zedge on there
are the people with an @ mods?
"They broke it" :D
In SD storage
icybeauti: and i'm confused
brony_7878: Yes. You should make a name for yourself.
ingwaz: What's your first language?
Lil_B isn't TOR illegal?
Invi: http://www.y.walww.com/watch?v=Ay_1IZGxMaA not sure if it is the real thing
Why do some people watch the show find a favorite pony and then hate all the other charcters?
Invi: nope
Invi well, watching a video blocked by GEMA would be illigal with every method
I clicked on it
all characters are awesome
Ringtones
See them
i like all the characters :3
Youtube is dced.
But no options to delete
CCCP: why would you think like that..?
03hold-press
03on the folder
03and it should pop up a menu
Invi: you got a right to surf the web annonymously, so using to can't be illegal, but you should make sure to not be used as exit for others
ingwaz: Ah. Heck, I think it's because we're staring at the stream at the same time as typing.
fuck gema
valoreins: because its true! i think many people have told me
O_O theres a user named discord here
derpy_pony it works :D how did you do that? ^^
Wakko <3 :D
I hope the arroz con pollo is ready....And the churizos....
icybeauti: entirely possible. i regularly have to do so much typing that i've learned to type blind without too horribly many mistakes
as I said. google ^^
Invi using a Proxy isn't illegal, its just makes it harder to identifie your location, and thats not illigal XD
ingwaz: I still haven't mastered that yet.
nope
CCCP: you forgot some people love ALL ponies, even previous generation
lol
I adit to owning G3 ponies as a child...
rofl
icybeauti: well, its just all about knowing where the keys are on your keyboard and knowing what mistake you make when you make one
teen girl squad in anthology 2...
guys its me brony
i decided to pick dis name :3
03ugh
ingwaz: I have to look at the keyboard to know what I'm typing,
wait
LOL
sonicandmario85: Just use that name whenever you come here so everypony will reconize you.
valoreins: i know, infact i might be one of those people
icybeauti: well, for example the past two times i have typed to you, i have done so blindly, with the exception of once openning my eyes to check and make sure i had properly removed a mistake
There is this button on the top main menu
'Allo, Bronies!
Hello, VenHur96
"manage my files"
HELLO
hi VenHur96
That worked
ingwaz: I look at the keyboard during each message.
I could hold down and delete
hey VenHur96 hows your day been
Hello, VenHur96
Finally done with the entirety of Anthology2
alexxm: Same as yesterday.
Now to check Settings to make sure it deleted them
there is somepony missing in the chat..
ok VebHur96
and its pinkie pie
It started really mediocre but got god a bit after midpoint and on
XD
03you might need to reboot the phone
dat NC reference
...
hi VenHur96
Okay so
sonicandmario85: The mods don't usually chat. They're either streaming or AFK most of the time.
icybeauti: have you taken any typing classes? thats what helped me quite a bit. before that i was unable to type beyond just hunting and pecking. but during the class i got very competitive with a friend about our typing speed which helped as well. now i can average around 80 wpm with few mistakes without looking at the keyboard
They're gone
But like
HELLFIRE!
You know how Android has tons of defaults?
Is someone streaming as always?

sonicandmario85: are you talking about the chat here and the one on EverfreeRadio?
02oh wow
11,02Alright, not busy anymore, going to stream again
03<Skydroid> Factory reset, it brings back everything to default? Including those ringtones?

11,02Not now?
Thought you were talking to him
SuperBrony64 ignore what i just said...
k
ohai Bronysith hows your day been
Y u not on Bronystate gaming document SuperBrony64?
/me hugs sper
sonicandmario85: Thats quite young by any chance have you read the rules? that is if you are new here
11,02Alright, I won't stream then...
SuperBrony64 I have the Everfreeforrest Stream popped out anyway XD
> Spain winning Euro Cup 4 - 0 over Italy
/me hugs SuperBrony64
When are they releasing the doc?
03I can attempt to explain it now if you want :P
i havent read them
ill go in a new tab and read them
SuperBrony64 ignore me, stream if you want!
02Drf, not watching the game
7 hours of no power
This sucks
yes!
02just watching the scores
Sonic Rainboom game!
Go ahead
SuperBrony64, your sister said you were mean to her
hey alexxm ive been good. trying to get mass effect 2 to work caused i just beat the first one and 2 wouldnt work so i reinstalled it and it didnt work so i found out i have to fucking download if off origin. FUCK YOU EA!!!!
alexxm: and you?
02becomes people over other nets just shout them
03OK basically
Better than 10 days of no TST like I just went through
/me runs
02in caps with bold
03Android has 3 separate partitions
Dat Mother 3!
03system, data, cache
sonicandmario85: Best do that btw to ping someone to respond to them try typing a bit of their name then press tab that auto finds the name if not keep doing it till it's that users name
If I may, can I ask your friend code SuperBrony64?
03there's others too but those don't do much
It's funny how he asks you and never answers back :D
i've been good Bronysith any idea what was up with it
11,02Dken2021: No I wasn't :<
03system is what makes the phone work, e.g. delete it and your phone is a paperweight
alexxm: it just wasnt working letting me launch
03data is... data
03derp
03cache is just a .... cache that makes the phone run faster
odd
listenign to part 3 shush!
I like the gojirra theme
03everything that comes with your phone is stored in system
03apps like phone/messaging/whatever, ringtones, any of the basic things
play some pony!!!
I spy a netflix
03any customization is stored in data
https://p.twimg.com/Awvss7MCAAAa-Ct.jpg
Dken2021: Ya don't say?
03a factory reset just erases everything in data and cache.
:D
FF6 pony!
FF6 !!!
Ia bronycon over yet?
I never get to play smash bros with anyone. My brother refuses to play it anymore
nope Alchemist
i read all the rules and OMG NETFLIX
03so anything that shipped with the phone, e.g. the stuff I mentioned, isn't affected
CrimsonPhoenix: i approve
Alchemist: It ends officially at I think 2am
THERES MOVIES ON DERE I HAVE IT TOO
CrimsonPhoenix dat storntrotter
03oh, any apps you install yourself are stored in data/app
03opposed to system/app which is the non-removable apps that come iwth eit
03make sense? Or am I being too technical :P
sonicandmario85: Did you see what i said you can do to respond to someone or ping them?
icybeauti 2am GMT or 2 am EST?
Alchemist: EST
In simplest terms :p
do i ahve to ping them?
have*
sonicandmario85: Ping what?
the person im talking too
sonicandmario85: No but you can respond to someone in a more easy way by doing that
wow, that means it will end around noon tomorrow for me :d
Closing ceremony at 18:00 EST
?*
after that people will probably dance, hangout party
oh my god =.(\
sonicandmario85: If you have soemthign to add to what they're saying, you should, but you genrally don't need to.
dat song
that the room reference
omagod lol
SuperBrony64: hi matt
Im' lsitenignt o 2112
Default ringtones are not affected by factory reset?
what a story
I'll bet Tortilla Soup must get a lot of views for no reason other than always being Netflix's default selection.
03right.
same with default apps
?
03right
I've never been to any convention ever. Wonder what it's like...
k
Then I can get rid of lolSuperuser
Alchemist I heard it's sweaty
It's stuck there
03nope
03superuser is in system
03I was just about to mention that
The Terminal disappeares
Alchemist: There were a ton of people, mainly venders, and a lot of cosplaying. There were a few creepers though.
:<
I've been to Arcadia at MOntreal
once
I've been to whole night events but that's different.
03now, if you root your phone, you get access to system
superbrony64: watch a mlp episode :3
first time I played the wii and it was on Twilight Princess
sonicandmario85: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
I think only 2 people understood why he said" DO you Speak Turkish" In german...
but
03you can delete apps from it (like the bloated crap that comes with the phone), as well as add things that aren't affected by resets
she can't root
03superuser is stored in system
.v.
icybeauti: SSSsssSSSsssSSSsss BOOOM!
03she can't root because you screwed something up :P
I go to a couple of conventions a year. But I want to add bronycon to that list as well :(
and that was just before the wii released
sonicandmario85: Do suggesting in #vinly_scratch
03the guides are pretty simple
Dken2021: well its summer so people tend to sweat :D
uh
Nope
I read all the guides
and the phone
yea, there's that too lol
is like nearly unrootable
or nobody bothered to make an exploit
I know I'll be going at Videogame live at the end of october
03there's an exploit...
yay Cinti Bell?
Yes
your cincin bell
sucks
03it has nothing to do with the phone company
It wasn't that horrible yesterday. I was able to eat outside with the friend in the shade and we didn' t suffer.
too bad no conventions are held in hungary, ever...
DRF
You try to root her phone
03I offered
Do it
03:P
Sky
let him root it
That Dracula reference
CrimsonPhoenix hope you have good time there, really wish I could go to that
.c.
what is man
Alchemist: You can xtry to make a hungarian brony meetup
or try to root
Oh Dken2021 I went there last year
awww.... why not use the original?!
the exploit ran
it was boss
it installed stuff
but
And if it breaks my phone?
it didn't work
03as I was going to say, there's only one proper way to completely reset a phone, including removing superuser and all that
Alchemist: If B.U.C.K will be held during next summer i could possibly attend
icybeauty: there are hungarian brony meetups, but Im interested in conventions
still didn't give me the root uid
CrimsonPhoenix: You went to bronycon when it was still underground?
03and that's flashing the firmware.
no
I went to Video Game Live
killerpony7733: BUCK is the one held in England?
bobs burgers..
And if rooting breaks my phone?
a orchestrate concert of video game music held by Tommy Talarico
CrimsonPhoenix: Cool. Montreal is a looooonnng wasy from where I lvie.
Cuz it's had glitches, as I've said
awwww yeah Bob's Burgers time!! :)
03if I can find a firmware flasher
Didn't have them before
03it can fix it
ON NETFLIX
03I won't try unless one exists
killerpony7733: already sounds good :D
03Motorola uses .sbf files, other companies use other things
and it has no commercials on netflix :D
THAT GODDAMN FROG
sonicandmario85: Your point? :)
We're cut for time also
03well yeah
i never watched it before but i heard about it
Alchemist: I live in denmark so for me the costs would be quite acceptable
I could listen to H Jon Benjamin's voice forever
also icybeauti VGL does the show at other places as well so don't worry
11,02Tovler: IKR
sonicandmario85: It's a pretty good show.
Is it buffering for anyone?
11,02He also does the voice of Archer :3
CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah, I bet they would come to NY
AttackWithHugs: Nope
You're in New York?
killerpony7733: the only way I could go is if I hitch hiked all the way, slept on the street and ate nothing but sunshine and drank nothing but air :D
I can't just be like, "Ohey, the person I'm meeting is still working on my phone" when I call my parents
CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah
dude that's not far from montreal at all
Ponies47:is it an adult or kid show?
probably like 8 hours on car
03XD
03well
woo, just realized my summer job ends in a bit over a month
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm in lower Ny next to NYC
03let me see if I can find a firmware flasher, as that's a surefire way to completely reset everything
03what's the model again?
Alchemist: Aww, still if B.U.C.K is going to be held next year i can most likely attend
something crappy
sonicandmario85: Airs on Fox so adult I guess. :P
I forgot
.c.
T759 Exhibit
still shouldn't be THAT much far
Hey everypony!! :)
03OK

killerpony7733: I will definitely check out streams and videos from BUCK and who knows, maybe I will win the lottery and go after all
alexxm: hows your day been?
icybeauti: I have been to london twice :P
it's been good ponyloverforeva
killerpony7733: Lucky.
alexxm: good to hear
Alchemist you could go to GalaCon, germany is closer to Hungary than the UK XD
icybeauti: You're not missing anything. London's crap. :D
Ok, so Italy are officially disappoint
O_O...
Lil_B: yeah, but my english is far better than my german :D
TEEN GIRL SQUD
icybeauti: Sorta yeah for a first timer there it's god damn interesting to be there but the feeling gets ruined when you get around enough
GilDash: Well, I don't know if I can say it's better than NYC

NIGHT EVERYONE :)
I had london once
poor italy

SQUAD**
im from england you know...

Heya Very_Silly_Filly
/me slices Very_Silly_Filly open and sits inside him
I saw Italy defeat England when I was in Germany, that was awesome

this show is strange
hi Very_Silly_Filly ;)
11,02Dat Very_Silly_Filly
GilDash: Oi for a first timer there it felt interesting but again you are right in the end

Very_Silly_Filly: ping hehehe

killerpony7733: For a first timer myself it felt crap. :D
BUFFER!!!
GilDash: Guess i was more lucky with the first time exprience huh? :D
/me dances on SuperBrony64 s head
GilDash: If you hate london so much, come to NYc for a bit.
When I dunno what you guys are on about, it sounds disurbing...
Lil_B you mean the panels will be held in primarily in english (for the sake of the invited guests) and translated live?
icybeauti: If I had the money, I would quite possibly take you upon that offer. :)
im eating a raw hotdof without a bun right now XD
and the end is near
hotdog*
11,02Oiy
GilDash: Because I live so close, I can go often.
icybeauti: Well, isn't that nice for you. :p
Condound the buffer! :[
Alchemist I can imagine that... but i can't guarantee, the Trailer was in english and the website too :/
buffering
*confound
SuperBrony64: Are you playing this on a sexbox 360? :P
this is the year of the buffer
Lil_B besides i know they accept foreigners, I've been to Braunscweig twice :)
theres an ad in the way D:
Day of buffer 7/1/12
nvm
damn buffering. It's like being stuck in bumper to bumper traffic
Om: I didn't say "move" I said spend some time there. If I ever did move countries, it'd probably be Australia.
*BraunSchweig
sonicandmario85 i suggest adblock
11,02Very_Silly_Filly: Wii :3
GilDash: Why australia? :O
SuperBrony64: I know, I was being silly
GilDash: Ohhh. Sounds like you already thought about all this
how do i turn it on im using firefox
As sexboxes load loads
Alchemist they exept them of course XD what I ment was that all the signs will be in german and english (and maybe even frensh)
11,02Alright, fixing the stream >>
Speaking of that, I lost my aviators in Germany when I rode a freakin' insane wooden coaster in the rain :(
GilDash: Hm interesting
killerpony7733: Would be more interesting if it had ever happened. :D
/me helps SuperBrony64 fix the stream by dancing on his head
But it was totally worth the ride; it actually ran kinda better in the rain than when it was dry xD
i have firefox is there a built-in adblock?
Lil_B: what is the convention called again? Galacon? I will look it up. I definitely cant go this year though.
sonicandmario85, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/
Alchemist ok, Tickets are almost out anyway I think XD

03look at those 666's
03I think something broke :P
oww
SLAMMED ON THE SCREEN LOL
aw
how'd you manage to break it
Why me, computer? What did I ever do to you?
03no idea
03but like
03it shows it as having a soundblaster sound card, but yet... no audio :X
and thats why derpy rocks
03and I can't reboot into DOS mode
03something is screwy
Attack have you been bad to your PC??? :P
wubwubwub xD
using a VM?
03no.
03that's an actual computer
/me just remembered that she bought the jumbo Zorua card from drf
03my old Compaq
Cool
03I think I'll wipe it again
03well
10I like how my dad didn't notice
03HML
03you might know how to fix this
Do you have a soundblaster 16?
Baily: No. The stream is buffering for me and when it DOES come up, it's basically a screenshot and nothing happens. I've cleared my cache and deleted all my cookies and it still does it.
03the BIOS is stupidly old
03and refuses to see anything over 8GB
i wish i had this game so i chould fight superbrony XD
03so it thinks my 40GB hard drive is only 8
03well
lol
03Linux, as well as Windows NT-based OSes
03will ignore the BIOS
03so when I installed XP on there, it shows all 40GB
03but 98 uses the BIOS information for hard drive sixe :/
03*size
03any idea how to bypass that? LOL
i whould be sonic because hes my favirote SEGA character :D
damn
hm
sb relies too much on items and the octo thing...
I swear I had a 10GB drive in 98
MM never had that prom before attack, not sure if there's anything I can help with sorry :(
but that was VMed
so
03oh, the OS itself supports it
03it's the installer that uses the BIOS
03I dunno if I can use something like Parted Magic
Sonics My Name.Speeds My Game
03to enlarge the partition
I swear this computer hates me today. It was fine yesterday.
!
03but what sort of live partitioner would run on only 80MB of RAM? :/
lol
AttackWithHugs: think about the things you said to it since then, maybe you hurt its feelings
dat bomb
AttackWithHugs whats it been doing
wtf derpy <.<
03hm
03This file is for machines older than a Pentium III class, such as an i586 or a PII with only one processor. <- will try
twilight_sprinkle: It wasn't doing this when I woke up this morning
my computers been really getting angry at me and its slowing down because of it and i did nothing to it
tentacle fun
Sounds good
Do it derp!
But you could try
extended/logical partitions
link special is best special
/me is away: I'm off doing other things; most likely sleeping or eating.
alexxm: The stream doesn't work on my end. All I get is a screenshot and nothing else, even after clearing my cache and deleting cookies
but I doubt that'll work cause of the BIOS
03in what o.o
03yeah
alexxm: Same thing happens in Chrome.

OperatorPony, Nothing, unless you're Luigi.
Is bronycon only in the usa or is there ones in lots of countries?? :(

In that case, if you do Luigi's taunt just right, you can actually KO someone with it.
Baily mainly US, but there are other countries setting up their own major con
Otherwise, taunting is just there.
Baily: theres bronycon in the usa and Galacon in Europe.

Operatorpony, I'm trying to figure out when to host the next meetup. I'm thinking late august since the fire restrictions will be lifted then
04I prefer Salt and Vinegar myself.
10-e
Strelok: пнх

10Salt and vinegar, never seen those
Strelok: so it IS serv

:( I'm getting a black screen
04They sell them over here, but lately I haven't been able to find any.
i missed de Lancies panel so im still oblivious as to why hes so liked, not that i hate him. can someone explain this to me?
Tovler like my mothers soul
okay i do desrive that kick
cant someone stream something?
Quick_Thinker...you do realize we can talk about anything here that doesnt invole gore...saucy saucy stuff...or the likes...
13This is not your personal roleplaying channel. Take it elsewhere.
there is not 1 photon
^What shizuka said
Wat
Shizuka: are you also on /k/?
Well, whatever
and me trying to stop a rping (i know it was in caps but that was to prove a point even if it failed)
OperatorPony, you should come over some time. You can hang with serv and I
Bluebell has a new icecream flavor.... they should've called it Pinkie Pie http://bluebell.com/what_were_crankin_out/new_creations.html
I do have family in AZ....... I could next time I visit them
also sterlok i find the autistic comment offensive i have a form of it by i won't take a grudge im sure you didn't know
Shizuka, how did I violate the rules when you kicked me? I can understand not saying "eat a dick", etc.
13You did not stop when I told you to.
10Google for Vinegar and salt Pringles, click on Pringles Wiki page, read about more flavours you've never seen or heard of before
Quick_Thinker, it's like calling something retarded. Not meant to offend, but rather to say the individual is acting in a stupid manner
10BBQ? I need to try that
funny thing involving RPing... there was a larp room at BronyCon...
fair enough just next time be a bit more careful with your words
:( I'm missing a fight
thats why you obey admins XD
10Grippo's BBQ chips are <3
I'm confused and just want clarification so I don't violate the rules in the future
04XD
04There is a Pringles Wiki.
04Really.
13when a mod tells you to stop, you stop
Operatorpony, sounds good. If you need a place to stay for a night or two, I've got a guest room
13is that so hard to understand?
Stop what, though?
has any pony seen Karaoke in a while he's supossed to play with me and AgentKalim in a MLP roleplaying game?
10Yes
Strelok: swag
Shizuka: flame thrower?
10http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles
I got my photos uploaded!
/me Gives Shizuka her Pyro gear
04I thought you meant
04like
Strelok: all the rules are listed i nthe link above
04an entire WIKI for Pringles
10Huh?
Alright, I'll take a look
anthology 2 was okay, feels like they tried too hard
Should I let the peanut gallery see them?
DeadpoolDash: but it is also a lot longer
Well, I got things to do. See ya'll later everypony.
DeadpoolDash: I did enjoy it, but the end......
04Like, you know how people make "wikis" for things, like there Bulbapedia, Pokemon Wiki etc.
10Oh
10Well, that's what it is
10Just not Bulbapedia
some of the parts lasted too long
so no pony has seen Karaoke ?
bye Zappy|CS6
10Light~
Geez, I hate roleplayins...but I REALLY hates non-bronys roleplayers...
/me glomps twilight_sprinkle

/me flips and sits on twilight_sprinkle
I mean, rolepplayers...
speaking of flames...
/me requests backup and 20 ponies sit on Bronysith
Speaking of something...
My fave part was leroy jenkins
/me glomps Meanwhile
Allo everypony.
oh Meanwhile stop starting

Shamroc: Start stoppin.
/me hugs AttackWithHugs.
hey Meanwhile hows your day been
/me glomps Meanwhile
Meanwhile: start stoppin ye slag
Meanwhile: i love something, somethings my favorite
my favorite part was throwing stuff on the ground
Shamroc: yer the slag, stop startin.
/me slag glomps Meanwhile
Meanwhile: yer mums the slag now start the stopin of the startin
Shamroc, Meanwhile: Both of you stop startin the start stoppin
Slag is cool again?
4LL! ;D
Shamroc: Naw, YER ma's the slag.
several hundred lines of output, and I'm supposed to catch the ONE that says it's not doing what I want it to...
*sigh*
hello Meanwhile
In #brony
Bronysith: you dont understand what slag means dont you...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBK5AsKF79A&feature=relmfu
Ur mums are all slag!
Stop startin
ALL the slags!
damn i wrecked
everyones mums a slag especilly mine
Shamroc: no i do
I'm not calling anyone a slag cause I don't know what it means!
:D
Bronysith: then you realize what you just said right?
Shamroc: yup

AttackWithHugs: It's from...What's that vid again? It was some anime.
You better start stoppin
slag? lol
ok then...what did you just say Bronysith?
icybeauti: that code Geass parody.
AttackWithHugs: Oh yeah that!
Shamroc save it has a pic for futher shennanigans
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: why dont you?
icybeauti: I don't know what the word actually means, so I'm not saying it.
Shamroc: i slag glomped Meanwhile
crashed again
Shamroc: so fucking wrong
Shamroc i'm busy drawing ..
Slag is British slang.
Bronysith...do you understand what SLAG means?
AttackWithHugs: We just throw it around here
Shamroc: one who only wants sex in the relationship
Meanwhile: Sounds like an insult
you and me hos
We're not all british.....Though i kinda wish I was sometimes :P
icybeauti: You kids *shakes her cane* Oh wait...
12hai~
So for those of you who don't drink tea, allow me to enlighten you. A slag is basically someone who sleeps around a lot.
/me collapse o-o;
like my mum
Meanwhile: Thank you good sir!
so like a slour?
Meanwhile: i drink tea so thats how i knew what it meant
Meanwhile: Um...I drink tea.
00,10and here i thought it was the stuff you get from the top of the forge when you smelt out the impuritys in metals
Meanwhile: like right after first sip i found out what that word means
I don't drink tea....I drink Coca Cola....
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Woah you got some good pencil drawing skills
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You're improving nicely.
alexxm you should look for the word ...
Sumica: you know. urban crap
Sumica: Yeah that too.
AttackWithHugs: Do you drink black tea?
/me gives slag out
Anyhow, operatorpony, I don't see how I was violating any rules. The whole "eat a dick" thing was obviously against the rules, but I don't see how calling the guy annoying is
03hi
Meanwhile: No. I have had black green tea, if that counts.
Yeehaw! I go home to Wisconsin tomorrow! But I have to do the 7 hour car ride AGIAN -_-
crashed again man i suck at SSX
Strelok if you ignored he would have gone away you giving him what he wanted
I love tea though. Herbal is my personal favorite, with honey.
Meanwhile shizu wants me to draw her and vivi and i'm scared ;A;
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You should be. Because if she isn't happy about the result she'll set you on fire.
Alexxm, so he's an attention whore?
:I
/me holds TheGreatAndPowerfulT
AttackWithHugs: Close enough. Black tea is the most common in England.
I'm now watching Gravity Falls, the cartoon Rob Renzetti dumped MLP for. I can see why; it's sooo much better.
seemed like one to me Strelok
Me too
Meanwhile: How does it taste?
That's why I told him to take his crap elsewhere
AttackWithHugs: Tea-like.
i ate a derpy sandwich and it was good
hmmm...6th edition 40K is out I think
Meanwhile: ...are you being a smarty-paaants ? :D
13it's not "slag" anyway
13it's slug
AttackWithHugs: I'm always being a smarty pants.
13as in someone who is useless
The only British slang I know is snogging....
derpys dead now because i ate her
It's slag. We don't use the word slug to describe useless people.
wha? D:
We call them politicians.
Derpy_Hooves: I think someone ate you
jk
inb4 Meanwhile picks Fat Slags for B movie.
nu ; A;
Yes
Derpy_Hooves: I'll save you -grabs you out of sonicandmario85's stomach-
Meanwhile: Sorry to inform you, I have taken up that job. Now, if you want the title of "Smart-(yay), you're welcome to lots of crazy answers :)
http://derpy.me/OHuje May I have your attention please?
shes not in me anymore
So who wants to go shooting with me in August? I finally got my AR built and I want to get more rounds through it.
:P i ate her and revived her
icybeauti: We're the only one's who use the term "snog" ?
Hiiii

00,10they never invented breaks and it's on a hill
CrimsonPhoenix: You say problem I say love of the show
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: kill me later
Sumica: Brakes
Sumica's like, "Sod it I'll drive it to the airbase"
Bronysith thanks
And then he crashes it
CrimsonPhoenix: If it's a moment that's integral to the episode, then that's just good retention, not a problem. :P

/me kills Bronysith
Spade-Magnes[R], it's all in a humorous way
Nopony remembers I was gone.... :'( :'(
/me dies and regenerates into the 43rd Bronysith
00,02Sumica, i'd recomend changing the engines on the wings, those are 175 thrust while the good turbo's are 150 and use bugger all fuel
lol
You're picking up speed...
/me Pokes Kipkat07_USAF 'HI!' :)
LOVE AND TOLERATE THE $&%@ out of dem people
And then he drives into the sea and they all die.

Wait. Does that mean we can vote for Anthology II in the lottery?
Can any of the mods make it to the sun??
Marx: It was pretty good, but a few bad scenes bring it down a little. Like what the fuck was with that scene where Applebloom gets Sephiroth's hair as a cutie mark? That. Is. Not. Funny.
00,02staging failure is best failure
:)
Bronysith great, GUILT
03Oh FFS

WTF is this!
dem oh mys
What the buck could this be?
what elseb
I don't understand how any BRONY can be against HOMOSEXUALITY
a documentary about a sad story
MagnetMarket: personal beliefs
Best Soundtrack
Band of Brothers, I knew it!
dreaaaamwooooorks
give me shrek
A brony is all about TOLERANCE
Military documentary? .....Greeeaat...
They "pacfic' version of this kinda sucked
They want tolerance for their own beliefs, yet they don't tolerate homosexuals.
MagnetMarket: honestly, I say let people live how they want if it doesn't hurt anyone else.
Documentarys are BORING...
Nothing but a bunch of hypocrisy.
VenHur96: You don't have to watch
VenHur96: indeed they are
MagnetMarket: still, best if you left that for later, enjoy the show eh?
VenHur96: you are teh dumbs
00,10who said this is a documentry?
there should be a documentary about people who rip off their toe nails.
VenHur96: this is no ordenare documantary
They're not boring for chirst's sake
/me Is proud to be a brony :P
Sumica: isn't this a semi-documentary?
Aw man I was missing Band of Brothers?! FUCK!
Sumica some silly filly
/me is brony to be proud wait wut?
I've seen this a lot though
Ponies47: /)
Irish_Pony: just started, you're just in time
otakon: oh thank the lord :F
Ponies47: whats a brony? can i have one?
:D
This is about World war 2 right
If you can't take the time to enjoy a good documentary then you just don't have any patience or curiosity
we should watch "Surviving the Cut" sometime on here. That shit is crazy.
DeathStar: It's isnt? ... *gets popcorn* For the plot, folks! FOR THE PLOT!
Narolas: agreed
CCCP: You can have my BONY in your MOUTH
00,10for the record, for somthing to have the "based on a true story" tag it only has to be around 10% true.
O_O
Gives CCCP a brony :P
what movie is this?
war documenterys are better on a NEW REDSTONE TV, get one now for 100000000 emeralds call (555)-555-5555
Sumica: meh, more or less :P
lol
MagnetMarket: oh....
:(
MagnetMarket: dude, the hell was that about?
Did I offend you?
Ponies47: :D
I apologize.
00,1010% of a story is usealy covered with locations and names
So what is this movie about? :3
MagnetMarket: nope :D
/me has never seen this movie
how long is this?
Ponies47: WW2
Has possibly seen this
Theres a snake in my boot
if you call now, we'll include a remote for your NEW REDSTONE TV
00,10it's about ww2, it's around an hour an ep
otakon: Intresting
This movie is about the great BRONY war of 2009
God, there go some goddamn brave bastards
^
when bronies fought for their freedom
hoofy_potter: just what I needed
its a show?
00,10there are 10 eps and we are showing them all over the corse of the next 4 days
To watch whatever they please.
band of brothers?
2 a day?
You know, I wish I had half the guts these bastards did.
Sumica: you should stream "Surviving the Cut" sometime. It documents real-life military personel training. I watched the Spec Ops one, and JESUS do those guys have some endurance.
Sumica: Sounds good to me. :)
otakon: actually most of them were dead and didn't have guts anymore
03<Soital> drf do you happen to have windows live 14 link again please? .w.
nice Sumica sounds good
For a movie made in 1942, this has REALLY good quality for its time.
03er
I wonder when war will be fought on this scale again
03it's on drfsueprcenter.info/Programs
00,103 today, 3 on the 4th
CCCP: still, braver than I
Come on, mentlegen
I feel if it is it will be against Iran
CCCP : i have to agree, they try to pretend like they did everything and i don't like it. Those soldiers are still some damn brave bastards
i guess
12oh sweet thanks =)
I hope all you non-US bronies are in for some hard-ass patriotism shoved fight up your ass.
why they no enjoy movie? =(
Yyyyep
RAWRity: ask the brits
CCCP well to be honest the US did fight the even more brutal side of the way against japan
Narolas: well that is true, even though some were probably drafted and didn't want to be there
Dick Winters.
if this was tf2 that soldier is a spy
You will be farting Bald Eagles by the end of this.
RAWRity: XD
I AM QUOTING THAT
damn it, me favorite tv show is on and my gf isnt here to watch it with me! :'(
^my little pony?
Irish_Pony: well that sucks man
Btw hoofy_potter are you new here? Never seen you here before
Happy hour
hoofy_potter: have you read the rules?
*sound
killerpony7733: well you do have a point
I don't know why people call it a documentary really, it's not, it's movie heavily Barbetos based on true stories, but it's still a movie telling a focused story
00,10Hows the quality?
Ponies47: Funny today we had so many new ish people around
Sumica: fine
Sumica: good
If you're a brony, your favorite tv show is automatically MLP
Good
MagnetMarket: ^ My Little Pony.
Sumica: perfect :)
oH
Heavily based * :p
killerpony7733: Nice :)
Ponies47 no, i watched a lot of season 2 live episodes on the fluttershy room
Narolas: now THAT was tab fail
/me yay
Haha
Other acceptable tv shows: A game of Thrones, Serenity, and dr. Who.
hoofy_potter: Ah. Okie doki loki :)
Hell if I was a lieutenant I would be afraid to sit around like that.
00,10Cool hats, I wonder how many supply crates they had to open to get them.
Love your bootcamp.
Sumica: 5
MagnetMarket: I say neigh neigh, my favorite shows ( dont have 1 in particular) contain weird stories - ponies is top animated show
Hi again guys
Sumica it was a random drop.
CCCP yeah japan has some god damn sadistic tactics and what not, still though on the russian front it was quite brutal as well but russia showed it's wrath when the nazi's started to falter
Damn this city is huge x.x
Cypresswolf|Pirate: Oh yeah?

VenHur96: Give it to the people. If they are hungry, let them eat cake!
It's training, not war. Different goal
MagnetMarket: we have no cake
Irish_Pony: to be fair, no man left behind is the marines, not the Paratroopers
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4885/
The cake is a LIE
RAWRity: :3
Leave NONE of the men behind!
MagnetMarket: creepiest one to me is the Russian Cosmonaut transmissions that were picked up by 2 brothers, both ham radio buffs
MagnetMarket darn it, I was gonna say that
Cypresswolf|Pirate: neat
00,10that should improve the picture a bit
RAWRity: well take a guess who has a Marine OC :P

Irish_Pony: otakon?
Looks like I clopped you to it1

Sumica: I love SOS
You think this shit is tough? Just watch "Surviving the cut"
Guess what Mountain time!
killerpony7733: Espcially the nurses ;)
Or look up "Extended training day" for the Para rescues.
Irish_Pony: So you get hurt and injured just for a chance to see the nurses? :D
Yyyyyyyyyep

killerpony7733: theyre worth it :D

so, everypony, mind if i ask for opinions on something? female coworker trying to set me up on a blind date with a friend of her friend who she only met once. been texting this girl a little bit to see if we share common interests, and besides both of us working on getting jobs as teachers, we seem to have pretty different tastes. thoughts?
Gets Promoted to Mess Officer
otakon: there is no softies allowed in the military
Ingwaz: give it a shot
oh God
Mmmm spaghetti
Lotsa spaghetti
Ingwaz I say goe for it
Ingwaz: DDate her
Speghetti is awesome
Ingwaz: blind dates.... idk im 14 lol
And this is just the WWII paratroopers. You would SHIT YOURSELVES to see what some of the Marines and PJ's today have to do.
this is not gonna end well
Lotsa spaghetti!
im back OMG DESKTOP PONIEZ
sonicandmario85: refresh

Yyep
otakon: again, welcome to the army.
Dang, that's harsh
Thast abitch move
CCCP: havent brought that up. thats one of those things that, while i'm not ashamed, i dont shove it in people's faces and could easily weird a person out, which then word would travel to my coworkers, and they'd be weirded out
YOu run until you puke.
RAWRity: no thanks, this is inhuman.
and then you run some more.
otakon: again, welcome to the army.
this a movie?
did charlie sheen walk by?

Charlie sheen is WINNING this war.

I dispise CHarliee sheen
and be a family man?
Sumica: ^
RAWRity: still ridiculous and the fact that not all of them made it back meant they went through all that shit for absolutely NOTHING.
In the military they have 2 goals: Make you into the strongest physical specimen possible, break you until you follow orders without a single pause.
so, make you cattle?
Are you going to bitch about every single thing? :P Welcome to the army.
YES
Yes exactly
otakon: they went through this shit to help make sure that at least SOME of them got back.
00,10but think of what could have happend if they were not as tough as they were.
You don't have to come back alive to make a contribution
its raining Men Hallalieua
No bastone
operatorPony: i'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing. It's something necessary to have a military function.
you're a soldier, you do what your CO tells you or you die.
GO GO GO GO!
Was that the FRIENDS guy that jist jumped
Yes, bc we've had revolutions to prevent people from getting treated like dogs and yet people go through this torture willingly... just boggles the mind is all.

otakon: to be fair, they ARE getting paid for this.
RAWRity: not enough if you ask me
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Hey thats what I said
meet the soldier helmet dude
otakon: any reason in particular why you think i should go for it? you know...the lack of similar tastes, fact that i dont know her...at all...and she normally lives 2 hours away, not really sure how to approach that
Sorry for my absence, I accidently hits the back key...
Lol
LIKE A BOSS
yay
Ingwaz: You can always just see her once and then drop it.
Ingwaz: for the hell of it. I did a blind date like that once. nothing came of it except for a night out though.
Ingwaz: I say at least go on one date. You may find you like her despite dissimilar tastes. Plus, nothing ventured nothing gained.
I think Katniss Everdeen said it best. "There is something inherently wrong with a creature that uses its own children's lives to settle its differences
This guy is the best.

Oh no, that robot is a ghost.
08,01it's not as good told in text

RAWRity: I say accent, he's a good actor.

how the heck can you do accents in a chat?
08,01anyhoos, imagine this in the appropriate old cockney man accents and old scottish biddy accents
02also, that 9 year old probably can't breast feed. Which would be a real problem in china
irregardless
irregardless
Its kind of Fucked up that some of the upper officers are housed with civilain families
remember
and this is where the Lt. has had enough.

02well, it is china. She's probably very poor and doesn’t have the money for it
yeah, lolno. The Anthology doesn't need streaming. It's kind of mediocre actually, starts to drag late.
GarrettBrony: the brits are so much better to make fun of though
Kiwi fucking? :P
AgentKalim: no, NZ'rs

I think it's only a crash if the operator doesn't say "Restarting" first Shamroc.
wait theirs another anthology ?
CreativePonyName: just released :)
02just a sec, there's plenty of stuff that says that
will it be on the stream later?
Personally I thought the second Anthology was kinda dry.
Meanwhile: the beggining was hilarious
Meanwhile: Oh dear, haven't seen it and i though the frist one was kinda meh
im gonna play kerbal space program demo XD
I got bored after 20 minutes.
Meanwhile: i thought it was dull as hell with a combined total of 3 minutes of anything funny.
but then suddenly LMFAO :| i hate LMFAO :|
RAWRity: Sounds about right.
Oh god...
The media going into Bronycon...
Without being there?
SOme of the bach landing i nthe other areas where little opposed

Sumica: good gift
SIGN IT DAMMIT!
Shizuka: on TF2?
No gravelpit for you.
only 10k?
13it jumps into commentary mode
13going to look up why
10k was a fair amount of money
cachi01|anthology: Hey, don't be buttmad. I don't like that song either. But that song coupled with the scene where Pinkie Pie has a party with a bunch of inanimate objects, including some rocks.... you mean you DON'T think that's funny?
AgentKalim: No. :I
sagas: Adjust for inflation, and I'm sure it's a lot more than that
Shizuka: type MOTD in chat
10k was good considering you had like a 50/50 chance of dying
What movie is this guys
TONAIGHT
lol
Kenboneboss: It's a TV show called Band of Brothers
Night of nights
thanks
Day of days
Sumica: Why do I have a feeling without Ross there, it'll go to hell? :P
Sumica: the opposite, he was incompetant
Shizuka: you turn it off again?
13yeah
00,10Ross gets them them lost
Damn, 10k in 1943 is like 132k today
it'll be hell either way tho
That'll be why Sending Client Info is taking forever then.
:D
ooh, Dear John letter
inflation you scary...
thats a bad way to learn your brother was killed.
Sumica. Is this a series? or the movie?
Vordox: series
00,10Serise
D-Day was a clusterfuck, which mainly suceeded because the operation was pulled off in a way that fooled the Germans worse than it fooled the Allies.
Monte Casio was a rough battle
^
"They're all scattered - holy shit, there must be ten times more of them then there really are!"
10Not everything on the internet is fact
into France.
http://i.imgur.com/iFPA8.jpg Oh wow
The allies were already in Italy
10and I don't see how one is better over the other until proven otherwise
D-day was essentially this: "THROW ALL THE TROOPS AT THE BEACH!"
wow...
CrimsonPhoenix: nice
It's been so lo.g
CrimsonPhoenix: What is this heresy
hen3ry: even with our fake, the only reason it wasn't a complete bloodbath was because we fed false info through spies that we had failed the beach landing. germans got no reinforcements for a ew days
RAWRity: ALL the troops? :c
David Schwimmer isn't in the credtits of stars on IMDB
XD
operatorPony, you don't get it
*long
...troops
Meanwhile: ALL THE TROOPS!
CrimsonPhoenix: hmm?
00,10Which troops?
Lyra shares Bonbon
High_Flyer: well, yes, British spais proved they were the best in the world.
Welp. I gotta go now. BYR EVERYPONY! :)
Sumica: ALL
to Carrot Top
ALL OF THEM
Lyra is cheating on Bon Bon with Carrot Top.
CARRRRROOTTT TOPPP
AND HAVE THEM BE LED BY TOM HANKS.
so D-Day HAD A GODDAMN PLAN XD
boohoo
Cya Ponies47, try to havce fun
Carrot Top is heresy
the whole war would have been lost if not for British counter-intel, several times
Oh contraire Barbetos
02like I said, it's not significant. But the real thing is always better
it's the THREESOME
Since I've been here, do you know our news?
Nothing like eating your first meal at 7pm
Lyra, Bonbon and Carrot Top
one of my history teachers in high school told us a story about how the Allies put inflatable tanks and ships at the point nearest to south Britain which moved the Nazis to that location, leaving Normandy beaches a mere fraction of the force it should have been
RAWRity: I'd gladly follow Tom Hanks, even on Omaha
to the point that Hitler at some point decided he wouldn't let the Brits troll him yet again, and ignored it when REAL intel fell into his forces hands.
hen3ry: ya. they tricked the germans in north africa by putting bad intel on a random dead body in a plane the british crashed off of the spanish coast.
It was hinted at in our previous conversation
or rather the Nazis planned
those trading cards seem pretty cool
I want the one with Time Turner
Hu
Yup, Patton's inflatable army
oh, the Doctor
what`s this?
13balloonicorn?
10lol.
balloony?
one way the British spread false info to the germans: they put fake documents and maps onto a corpse, then dumped it out into the ocean near the german coast dressed in a general's uniform.
balloonicorn.
baloney
00,02Sumica, i've just started getting that sas problem
00,02rockets spinning for no reason
what movie is this?
The reason this war was won is thanks to everyone, every country that sent soldiers, and every french spies and members of the resistance that actually made the D-day possible. The french resistance even sacrificed members that were told fake information about D-Day so the germans would not expect it where it actually was
00,10yup
13yaaay it worked
13server is back up
dukedontnukem: TV miniseries Band of Brothers
Why does fimfiction.net always derp the night of the Anthropology update. ><

brb ima go get something to eat im kinda hungry
Sumica: Is David Schwimmer coming back? :P
00,02Sumica, actualy never mind
hot hot pony!! http://imgur.com/gallery/o3AJO
00,02why did they do that
00,10if you use the small one only mount one
in conclusion, Allies kicked flank, Nazis bit the dust and we were all happy for about ten minutes until the cold war started.
I always find it frustrating how people forget the french resistance, those people never surrendered, and sacrificed a lot, especially considering this was THEIR country they saw getting destroyed by the nazis
00,10if you mount two of them Phase4 flip one so they counter balence
Narolas: Because the winners who shout the most, gets the most.
....I see what he did there...
You know, I have to wonder if the guy who shot Archduke Ferdinand realized how much of an effect he'd have on history. It's nearly 100 years later, and we're STILL dealing with the fallout from that one assassination.
00,02Sumica, not sure what you meen
Vordox : yup, lot's of unsung french heroes in this war
00,10the small sas, dont mount them in pairs
you know what is scary operatorPony ? I thought it was a rocket all along
Narolas: i always bring up the french resistence when talking about WWII, mainly because the resistence tended to be more successful than the actual french army
Narolas: Not just that, we in Sweden gets alot of shit for being passive....Most people here do not even KNOW what happened in Sweden wth Nazi.
00,10use only one or flip one of them over to prevent the torque issue
flutter_spin: I t hoguht it was a PENIS
vordox : Some were in my family, my grandfather even got send to a nazi camp
Yeah, I'm beat from all the craziness of these past two days, so I'm going to bed. See ya.
00,02Sumica, i didnt
00,02just the command module and nosecone sas
everyone also forgets that italy rose up during the war under their king and captured/hung Mussolini.
Have a good sleep Marx
00,10remember the hover jet thing I made Phase4? it had 4 of them. it makes the issue verry noticaable
if i rember correctly werent these planes built to lose even an entire wing section and still fly?
Not everyone..
im eating an apple right now XD
Quick_Thinker: I dont thnk so
00,10they could take a pounding Quick_Thinker, but not that much
02Formulated does have its benefits though. Like when you’re in public
Quick_Thinker; not lose that much, but still take a ton of damage and be cheap to build in large quantities
02|D
00,10they also can tow a glider behind them
High_Flyer: It's sadly true. There's a lot of things to take into account though, shouldn't just assume the army was bad . the blitzkrieg shocked and surprised everyone, and the overall way europe was seeing the possibility of a war (they were so scared because they remembered the first one, they tried to ignore the signs) that the troops just weren't prepared
yep
Yugoslavia had the one of the best partisan fighting forces during the whole war. They actually managed to free themselves from Nazi control from resistance fighters alone
00,02O_O
10Pfft
Quick_Thinker: You're thinking the B-52 flying fortress. Those things could take a fuckton of damage and stay in the air.
sat wall
00,02i was spin stabalizing my rocket
00,02then the command module just fell off
SolairePony89: yeah the Yugos here awesome
00,10over torked
12bathrooms
00,02no warning, just pop
12this is all
00,10er torqued
breastfeeding is free.
just saying
Part2 noaw!
the Polish resistance was great too but couldn't win
00,02wasnt moving fast
02yeah
I had the same issue with my mini-shuttle.
Funfact: because of weight restrictions, armoring for planes was very restricted. The way they decided on where the planes needed to be most guarded was by examing planes that returned from the field, and placing armor on the places that never showed any bullet holes.
lotsa planes 0.0
The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people march with you
saves the parents lots of money in the end
:p
Aww
Shuttle not spinning at all, not under any torque, approaching the moon with a rocket still under it for counterburn... boom, lander's rocket just snaps off.
The entirety of europe resisted and sacrificed, but we only remember the winning soldiers from d-day
02And it’s more sanitary
The logic being that any parts that WERE damaged were areas that could be hit and still allow the plane to function.
02for the baby
I swear there's more to that speech then was shown
well this was the war when we did our most ssupport to any way ever if i do remember it well bu then again i may be wrong
RAWRity: wait WAIT, they armored the portions that WEREN'T hit? the helll logic is htat?
00,10there is SolairePony89
00,10but it was a long speach
FUCK YEAH FUCKING DIO IN ANTHOLOGY II \m/:[\m/
otakon: if a plane took damage in one of those places it didn't return, therefore that spot needed armor
otakon its pinkie pie logic
*clop* Nice movie, even for 1942 standards...
is this all for the 4 of july?
RAWRity: what about the pilots? since you know without them THE PLANE CAN'T FLY ITSELF
woot! Anthology 2!
Sumica: I only really remember that speech from MoH: Frontline
GarrettBrony: eeyup
it's pinkie logic, but it's brilliant pinkie logic
Silly Fluttershy, you don't have fingers, cachi01|anthology
Part 2 next plz :)
Vordox: lol
otakon: You're not thinking about it enough. They armored the untouched spots on the planes that RETURNED.
otakon: they DID do their best to protect the pilots. The goal was to armor the plane to protect its most vital areas.
03not that anybody minds breasts in public though
I still say MoH is the cloest to ACTUALY BUCKING GOOD War Game with feel
/me runs
^
CoH and BF got nothing against the story telling of MoH
no pony left a comment for my fic Quick Thinker :(
yeah, if you armor a plane you weigh it down too much
http://fav.me/d55qzus post HBO picture by yours truly? :(
oi! Shizuka need you for a moment
13ohai
RAWRity: ah, so the crew was obviously not in the most vital areas. I see.
00,10I liked MoH
02LOL
lol, you do fanfics too Quick_Thinker ?
Quick_Thinker: :(
Sumica: the first one is a utter classic
only a few
its like a sports cup for planes
Shizuka: 2 things 1. panda drew this for you http://imgur.com/xUf2r and 2. PM panda :P
MoH rising sun was my first FPS
i have a seperate account on Fanfic
So, streaming Band of Brothers in advance of Independance Day?
Sumica: and the PS2 first one was good too, Frontline and ll that
otakon: or, more likely, there's only so much armor ou can put on the cockpit without it destroying their visibility.
00,10and yes part 2 is next
YES
13awwwww
RAWRity: true
00,10yeah I had frontline
:O someone should SO stream Patriot
13wuuuuuuuuuuuuub
Nice. I'm in the process of a trilogy with a few Bronystate OCs in it
Sumica: Anthology 2 or BoB episode 2?
Sumica, /)
and I don't get what you're arguing about the pilots. The pilots getting back kind of ties in with the plane returning.
Shizuka: is that you?
anthology
YES
rethink it, otakon. Let's say a plane comes back safely with a tailwing shot up to hell. Logically, that means shooting at the tail doesn't matter, therefore _don't_ waste armor weight there. By process of elimination you get the places that really matter.
moh allied assault was the best.
00,10BoB 2 is next
00,02this one just explodes sometimes
awww
which does include the cockpit
00,10then a intermition, then part 3
00,02no warning, just falls apart on pad
I still occasionally go back and play Frontline. Game never stops being fun
Phase4: lol
Same goes for CoD2
hen3ry: no, I know what your saying.
wait, how long is this?
hen3ry you are putting a lot of thought into a coomment that has went by at 50mph
its raining men
00,10that is a signe of the game engin breaking down Phase4
00,02probably
00,10time for a restart
Quick_Thinker: he's a quicker thinker than you it seems

Kenboneboss: yes. just yes
/me hugs Shizuka <3
13[21:23] [ Irish_Pony] Shizuka: 2 things 1. panda drew this for you http://imgur.com/xUf2r and 2. PM panda :P
The whole EU was against Hitler to try and get some control, then USA come in at the end and then take the spoils when it's the weakest? :P
00,10it's Band of brotheres
Im good, otakon
VenHur96: PUNCH!
Hi Rain.
00,02there we go
00,02now it doesnt instant explode
03or like, any straight male?
Quick_Thinker: What, is that a catchphrase now something, like "I'm a doctor, not an x"? :P
Shizuka: Im just the messenger :P
WHERE IS PANDA?
i guess :$
that magnificent bastard!
02well really, people shouldn't mind
Vordox: More like the whole EU was conquered by Hitler, except the UK, then the USA came in to give the UK the muscle and materiel they needed (UK already had the brains)
Hey we should Stream ID4 on July 4th
I must thank him myslef
oh dear god, its Shizupyro
Vordox: Not even close
GarrettBrony: maybe, maybe. we are getting BoB though
GUys, anyone else here liek guns?

Irish_Pony why did you want me in here?
panda-drawing!
13<3333
AgentKalim: I likded that stream the other night
The UK could not have defeated Hitler without the US' help... the result of a WW2 with no USA entry probably would have been the Iron Curtain being the English Channel.
Quick_Thinker: did I read something about a fic you needed readers for? pm it to me
this chat is a band of Bronies
Dat Shizu.:3
panda-drawing: theres your reason :P

RAWRity: So thats why spike is always staring at her chest..
Sumica: why? she looks good and is obviously enjoying herself.
Sumica: what happened? :S
What Sumica?
What happened?
otakon: lower back problems later in life.
youdontsay
plus, sagging
RAWRity: maybe, if she doesn't take care of herself.
gravity is a cruel mistress
RAWRity: What you talkin about?
RAWRity: agreed
yes they were but there werent implemented
RAWRity: Should be a pretty sweet ride for her. UP UNTIL THAT POINT.
Vordox: the girl dressed as Rarity in that pic has a very large bust.
More dead ponies.
Popeye

London: really?
00,10Fluttershy revels in the death of trators
war, gentlecolts
Irish_Pony: Still not an excuse to KILL THEM
Irish_Pony: -lol
Irish_Pony: yeah, but executing PoW's is definitely against the Geneva Convention.
anthology had crazy train..... they cut the awesome intro riff with some bullshit rap or idk what :l

08,01i hate the buses here
08,01i hate the people
00,10Was the Geneva convention around at this time?
the beatiful people
^yes
The Nazis obeyed the Geneva Convention (when it comes to the western front anyway)
Sumica: eeyup pretty sure.
08,01and i hate the way my nostrils are clogged up with black gunk
Can't hate the women can you?
Eastern front... not so much
08,01i shit you not
thank of it this way: you keep them alive, you have to feed them, guard them to prevent escape, and keep them with you. You kill em? You say they got killed in the line of fire and move on with your most likely short remainder of your life.
Sumica: Pretty sure it was set up after WWI
otakon: so tell me this, if you captured 10 enemies, enemies counterattack, enemies get prisoners back, its war logic, its a smart move no matter how sick it may seem
Spriggals: unless I know here personally and she's a bitch, not off the bat.
oh god .... i knew i was forgeting something important ...
Irish_Pony: well fuck, kill the children too since by that logic they'll want revenge for their father's deaths.
Irish_Pony: They weren't killed for that reason though. They were killed because one soldier went badshit bonkers
otakon: Ah, you've read Machiavelli too, right?
otakon: and thus you have Ghengis Kahn's way of life.
why are you all talking about Rarity?
hen3ry: no, i'm being mentally repugnant atm.
Ghost30k: because http://i.imgur.com/LaMT8.jpg
SolairePony89: you cant be too careful, kill one, the rest jump you
otakon: Fair enough.
Ghost30k: girl cosplayed as her, she's very busty in a skimpy dress.
ahhh
so i'm not the only one watching Band of Brothers
but she looks like she's enjoying herself too
Crazy soldier killed prisoners illegally. It happens in war, it's not right but it happens.
Ghost30k: enope
SolairePony89: I concur. The moment that guy appeared, I knew some shit would happen.
otakon: okay that's good
Oh, and that "See you around"
That crazy soldier is Spears.
Irish_Pony: He shoudn't of killed any though! And one group of soldiers isn't gonn that big of a difference on a frontline with MILLIONS of troops on both sides
otakon: well of course. She's at bronycon in the compan of a fine gentleman such as Fancy Pants
brb need a drink

Fml... well i'll make it up in the next one ....
SolairePony89: every man counts when your defending or attacking, no matter how big your army is

But not atm
Suicdal Tree person
tree is best cover
00,10i hear he's in the trees
HAH
Irish_Pony: Killing prisoners still isn't a good idea. It'll build hate in the enemy army and make them less likely to surrender and more likely to fight to the death, which means more losses. And sense every man counts, looseing a few men wouldn't be good.
Triple grenade charge. :P
5 nazies.
them were some small ass nades
small ass fuses*
5 werchmant*
also if anyones wondering im 9 years old
00,10ass shot
RAWRity: agreed, something akin to that happened at Otacon about 2 years ago, someone pulled an alarm and they had to evacuate 20K people into the Inner Harbor in Baltimore. The cosplayers mingled in the middle of tourist season. Fun stuff.
Phase4: Tell me about it. I nearly get to space and suddenly the G force angle angle of trajectory causes my wings near the tip of my craft to break off and slice/explode into my thrusters >:3
Rain: most nades you get 3 seconds.

Spriggals: Not a dud, just REALLY lucky
otakon: one of the lights when splodey. nobody was hurt and the con runners got stuff under control real quick.

Quick_Thinker: I think the german ones were NOT shrapnal grenades
RAWRity: nice
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU SHOOT AROUND CORNER.
FUCKED UP HIS ASS
Phase4: -lol I will but the way I am set it will only take you to about the uppermost layer of atmosphere before everything starts going outa wack. I've tried everything with that ship >:3 so hope you have better luck than me -lol
lol
SirGanjalf: ah, the M1 Garand one of the finest semi-auto's ever made.
sounds like he got rapped by a nazi
SolairePony89: then thats when you have to be careful of how many you kill, kill to little, enemy isnt intimadated well enough and will possibly get that force back, kill too many, then thats when what you say happens
If hes lucky he will get a female nurse.

RaveBrony: Call of Duty: The TV Series! DUN DUN DUU-Ok, not really, just some HBO show...
The grenades are dangerous in a upward angle.
otakon: I could recognize that "no ammo left " sound anytime
do what the Inglorious Basterds did: kill all but one, then send him back to spread your legend with a Swaztika carved into his forehead.
operatorPony: yeah, but the siderooms are closed atm.
otakon: The luck has been doubled!
Not the low angle, much higher chance of missing

RAWRity: Eh, it's "okay".
CriticKitten: if by "okay" you mean so overly-long and one-note.
Cloud then how are you watching this if you are still in the Army. Do your friends know you are a bronie?
<.<
Rule nr 1 = YOu won't get hi by a nade.
what episode was that?
because, you know, it's not like watching MLP clips with music played over them would get boring after an hour.
Rule nr 2 = Have Spears
superretroworld: two
nope...i think my roommate has a idea but i doubt he understands
superretroworld: Episode 2
Rule 3 = Muffins

Rule 4 = Profit
The thing is - I had to get the reference. I was quite surprised there was only 1 clip I totally hated.

RIP Scootaloos
Isn't it a 4.56?

sonicandmario85: deal with it and calm your tits
Gilda was mean to fluttershy, but Griphons are still awesome
/me that is no reason to kill her clestia yet again goe and heals trixie
sonicandmario85: Could't you just kill Gilda instead?
I hate Gilda. she was MEAN
very mean
i think pinkipie did that alrdy
*kills gilda instead* :3
yay
if someone is mean to fluttershy, it means she's too cruel and must die
blind
My Bucket List; Kill Gilda for making Fluttershy cry
word to the wise: making comments about killing characters is incredibly fucking stupid.
Sumica: his mother must have been shot and he went blind
:P

I like the comment under that episode. Guy wrote "Hang on bronies. I'll get my bat"

GO SPEARS
they took a bulltet to the knee
Better than arrows.
Spears is an inglorious bastard
is there anyway we can have sheduled showings during the week?
which is not matching reality, at least WW1. I remember my great grandfather telling me of winter in the trenches, the soldiers took the day off, shared smokes and booze.
/me clestia TELLS sonicandmario85 NOT TO TRY ANYTHING FUNNY
Then...who tooks the bullet?
spears gonna die anyway
00,10nope
^
I kind of like the random showings of the week
Keeps it a surprise
that sounds so wrong Weapons on me
I was a solider like you.Then i took a bullet to the knee
nice fields
FUS RO DAH!
see, this is cool and all, but I feel like them just interviewing the actual veterans would make for a more engaging show.
no.jpg
hen3ry: WWI was kinda different, with the trenches at other stuff
it suck if you were a private in the military and your last name was Parts
00,10more of we all have reallife things we do outside of bronystate
lol. I kind of agree RAWRity
SirGanjalf: true
hey who's the pony on the bottom left of the screen supposed to be?
OC
Sumica, Xaiden
RAWRity: Thats what History Channel is for.. and they did it
YAY!
Big_Macintosh_1992: Email someone :D
It's a trap!
ITS A TARP!!!
I think it is under the FAQ
THE GERMANS HAVE A GODDAMN PLANNNNNNNNN
die you capitalist scum
WWI was a much more straighforward war: send wave after wave of men and throw poison gas and bombs at eachother until somebody wins. Planes and tanks and the like weren't advanced enough for any serious damage like they were in WWII
werent theyu japanese?
FUCKING GERMANS
whatever
history sucks
thats it
There weren't a lot of Japanese troops in France.
just watching for the war scenes
Flaron: the Japanese offensive was mostly navy.
RAWRity: WWI was about territory so much
I don't even care for the plot
sorry
*
RAWRity: their were tanks just not very common
thanks "RAWRity"
RAWRity: sacrifice thousands of men for a couple of yards of land
oh hey doesn't a FF kill happen in a minute
*gives derpy a muffin and celestia sees*:3
Flaron: why the qote.
I like trains
quotes*
meh, just felt like it
OohShiny: so does sheldon
operatorPony: more or less, yeah. Only to lose those few yards the next day.
I liek trains 2OO!
What's this? We seeing a random unannounced movie?
2OO
there IS a reason WWI was originally called "The war to end all wars"
[][ooo][ooo] choo choo
RAWRity: Sabaton "Price of a Mile"
/me sonicandmario85 someone already took derpy away
problem is, RAWRity, WWII
let's play a game
At the time it was called The Great War.
i meant the adult derpy XD
*jigsaw's mask*
RAWRity: unless there are no more ppl in the world, einstein said 'as long as theres men there will be wars
not the filly derpy
I like games
all thats left is : clestia (surprised no pony had the guts to try and take her)
Rain: oh, I know, but at the time it was easily the most savage war anybody had seen. They kind of thought that this one would...scare us off of doing it again.
lol
It reminds me of that MAD FiM parody of War Horse. Fluttershy: "This is really called the Great War, but we're calling it WWI so we don't confuse the audience!"
RAWRity: Then hitlet, then USA USA USA USA USA
we are too head strong for that
Little did they know: we'd eventually put sanctions onto Germany that would lead to Hitler's rise to power in germany
quick its spelled celestia not clestia :P
and then, after WWII, we placed MORE sanctions on germany...which led to the cold war.
snoring wil get you killed private
well, that, and we let the German Army return under circumstances where they could lie to themselves and say "our leaders sold us out" rather than "we got our butts kicked"
he killed a sergeant
Which by proxy led to the taliban gaining power in Afghanistan.
anypony read of watched All quiet of the western front?
did he stab him?
poor guy
Yes
At least WWI wasn't as harsh to civilians as WWII; with deatch camps, carpet bombings and penal batallions raping, murdering and pillaging everything on their way
ah
Damn....
god damnit and this is why you dont jump to conclusions
"He looked liek aKraut"... Everyone looked a like. Thats why the Pacific theatre was so much more.. dehumanized
Which led to the whole issue in the middle east we've been dealing with for 11 years now.
Where is this going RAWRirty?
stop talking about history
god
ded
RAWRity Though it was 20 years if you count Kuwait
it's a trap!
don't go soldier
so yeah, because Archduke Ferdinand couldn't take a bullet, 9/11 happened.
OohShiny, what's wrong? dont like learning from the past?
Flash! Gordon!
DONT CHEW MY ASS BOY Son:BUT IT TASTE SO GOOD DAD
history hurts my ideas :P
lol
Flash! I'm a mac, I'm not compatible!
Rain, nah, it's all in the past
Hehe
ARCHDUKE FERDINAND WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND 9/11.
what I care is the present and future
OtakuTom: Well, that's a bummer *shot*
but if you dont learn from the past, you are doomed to repeat it, OohShiny >3>
ok the checklist for fillys left: dr.hooves (nvm he used the TARDIS and left) cranky doodle, Candice, Shining armor, Spike
OohShiny: ah, but you forget: those that do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.

lol
I thought it was CN
albeit much more inaccurate
rocket launcher go
vordox: a human shows mercy and feelings....a soldier dose not have time for such things
Maybe, they weren't equipped with bazookas, and panzerschreck was a loot?
I don't like soldiers
i play too much call of duty...
SirGanjalf: ah loot! If it moves, kill it. If it doesn't move, loot it.
airborn dont carrie anti tank wepons in those days to big could not drop with them
I saw that catch phrase in some rpg game
00,10keep in mind they are paratroopers and they lost most of there gear on drop.
why does it have to be low quality?
otakon: If it doesn't move, shoot it in the head to be sure.

SolairePony89: dat spoiler
ah, the BAR
PING
ded officer.
Shamroc: It's just a guess
great gun, too heavy for the capacity though
WWII gets all these big movies based around it, showing the Allies in the right and the Axis as evil. But Korea and Viet Nam films and books almost always focus on how horribly it effected the soldiers.
dead

MP40 was better
i do have a cutie mark and it has the youtube logo on it which means i like watching youtube XD

SirGanjalf: same language as anywhere else ...WOOWOOWOOWOOWOO!
00,10nah it was just realy soft dirt he's fine
wanted to ask how you were able to get here from your smart phone
WOOOHEEEE
Funfact: the telltale "clang" of an empty gun began to become synonymous in the battle field with a sitting/open target, and a chance for the enemy to shoot. Soldiers began to use this to their advantage, by firing a few rounds off, then clicking a shell against their helmet. Thus, the enemy would think they were out of ammo, come out to shoot, and get caught unawares.
lol Mica
kill streak! call in a helicopter!

During World War II, German soldiers stationed in the Alps sought edelweiss to wear on their uniforms. Edelweiss was considered a symbol of bravery because it was dangerous and difficult to climb up to the high, craggy areas where the flowers grew to obtain them.Read more: The Meaning of the Edelweiss Flower | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/facts_6745402_meaning-edelweiss-flower.html#ixzz1zR400zeI
