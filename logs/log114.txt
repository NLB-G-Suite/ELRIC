so is that
sod off strange person
/me hands Tavi 500 points for trying.
Hard to know what you ment when I was using my point of context.
Well I knew flapjacks and pancakes weren't the same thing, but I've never had flapjacks. I've had crepes though
Dashite: Nope.
=w=;
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts Am live here
Eeeyup
Those aren't flapjacks in the UK sense.
                             
                             
                             
                             
                             
Which was what I was asking.
:X
No you didn't/.
Whatcha gonna be streaming?
6Eelol~
stop.
You're changing the question now.
Me singing.
why does this channel not hand out ops and hops so annoying people can be kicked?
thi
this
Ah
Some pony songs, some non-pony.
/me giggles.
/me giggles
RobotPinkie has a point.
I asked what you thought a flapjack was.
Cat, just not really active I suppose.
I'm English.
huh, no ad
D:
i am confuse.
You didn't specify a cultural context.
So therefore I mean the English meaning of flapjack.
Therefore you are wrong.
but kicking is fun and educational!
No.
Yup
It's called inference.
Hey dari want some Rocky Mountain Oysters?
Use some.
I'm English.
jesus, is Navi from Ocarina of Time on here?
Stop nicklalerting me.
I use the English words.
y r u not lsten me
Sumica: Lawl.
That's the whole point Dashite.
Say what you have to say already
or are you just going to keep on saying listen.
y r u not lsten me
y r u not lsten me
y r u not lsten me
That's why I'm asking, duh.
cscope -R -b
there was no such premise to the question, duh :P
eh wrong window
What do you meen you people....wait that doesn't work here.
so stop now.
I just did, because they misinterpretted my question.
guitar is killing your vocals today
Because you didn't provide enough information.
/me hugs Dashite and Sumica as well. "Nooo... love an tolerate...!" >_<
and*
No
Use common sense.
6Disregard Dari, acquire flapcakes~
lol
okee
Use proper English. :p
Because no one here knows you and you are annoying people.
I do.
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                
6Dashie, PM~
yay~
Obviously not. You intentionally asked a question that you knew people would misinterpret.
:D
can we gline him now?
lol it's all good Fluttershy, I am not arguing here just snarky.
Speaking of musics.
I shall aquire Clapfakes
Probably.
No I didn't.

/me slaps Cat around a bit with a large trout
You are meant to understand the question.

6Clopcakes?
I'm a DJ on a radio show, available online, and I'm going live in 40 minutes (PLUG PLUG PLUG)
I wanna sing along with him :(
Which isn't possible if you don't provide enough specifics.

Lawl.
Your assumptions are invalid
Everyone here knows that.
Today I'm doing a Queen Tribute show because monday was Freddie Mercury's Birthday.
Whouls that be shaped like a hosresshoe?

6Did somepony say weeaboo?
6I think I heard somepony say weeaboo. . .
You don't need specifics.
I'm sorry you're so wrong Dari. :p
is it a particularly retarded bot or something?
I shouldn't have to spell everything out fo you.
Are you a baby>?

6ARE YOU A SPY?!?!?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE7CEycI7nc
Flapjack = Pancake is a perfectly valid response to "What is a flapjack."
hey listen
u can not
gline
Not given the context.
bcoz m proxy
user
6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapjack
hit that note!
or ill spank you!
BRB guys
Easy enough.
/me adds dnsbls
n i will connected
Who use the term Flapjack = pancake.
Classtime, gotta go.
"Flapjack may refer to
The context being I use UK English words.
A thick pancake, referred to as this particularly in United States and Canada
Flapjack (oat bar), a sweet bar made from oats and golden syrup in British cuisine"
yay~ close enough
:)
clap clap clap clap
Okay screw it
If you had asked a british person and they had said flapjack = pancake, then you could say they were wrong.
I hate feeling left out
you do very well
Sing Giggle at the Ghostie :D
n dwn server
Cat, major fun.
If I ask anyone I can say they're wrong.
6but what if they're right? o:
so what?
I do like fun
:o
aww :9
You didn't get the answer I was looking for - wrong.
well you can SAY that
same words different definitions.
The answer is Lupus
6but I did get it right. . . ;A;
VioletVanilla: Not you. :P
6No WhatPayne, it's never Lupus~
wait what?
I gotta be up proper early tomorrow morning to cat a train :<
So tell me.
What's an aubergine?
/me feels accepted as an individual by Dari for getting it right
cat a train
lol
:>
We didn't get the answer you were looking for, but it was still a correct answer given the question you posed.
it's a word Dari!
You got the wrong answer.
well the train works out cheaper than going by car
It's a plant.
I will Start
FLooding
That's so funny I forgot to laugh
so what?
I don't care whether you think it's right or not.
What's he singing right now?
ill just go to mcdonalds.
In my eyes.
Cupcakes!
You were wrong.
Okay good
well then your premise with asking was wrong
Omg..
....
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Spitfire-Wonderbolt-Friendship-is-Magic/214255751932016
Only because you didn't specify which version you were talking about.
Look at the most recent post
hardcore remix dubstep!
You need a new mic.
I fear your annoyances would fall on deaf ears
6In my newly painted fingernails-- Oooooo~ Shiny!
Nope.
Dubstep!
lol
no one really cares
yeah
its just a chatroom
If Sketchy_Sounds ever makes a REAL RECORDING of this music, someone will dubstep remix it.
"Seems like everypony is getting sick lately"
D=
Wha? Whats this>
Like, with a real mic
o.o
He wrote more lyrics? Thats ingenious.
6This is true Pinkie_Pie
No one knows what an aubergine is?
Lemon_Lime: yeah
that is the rule of this community- provide 18 seconds of audio and there will be 48 dubstep remixes
I know, yet I don't care :P
2nd verse = Pinkie Pie's recipie from Applebuck Season
Do you know what argy-bargy means?
3rd verse = Applejack's bucked-up recipie
Hence "baked bads"
Ah
I told you, it's a plant.
/me smahes her phone. Work, stupid.
Okay the stream is really, really shitty on my end
oh, not just me, then
But specifically.
Eggplant.
what stream :O
Yes, it's a bit stuttery here.
No, it keeps cracking and breaking up
Yay!
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
And I've never heard the second term.
WoOOw
6Argy-bargy? as in a verbal dispute Dari?
this is really sad
:D
Derail fail VV =p
Oh no.
Pinkie you gotta stand up tall!
Cat happy

Yeah as in you got it right.

wtf is going on in here
well that was... interesting
/me covers her ears with her socked hooves to block out Sketchy's high notes
How about clingfilm?
6I was talking to Sumica with that question Dari, but thank you~ ;3
Trying agian.
again
Seemed like you tryed to chage the topic VV
I now know just how stupid the internet can make people
Saran wrap or equivalent I assume.
we have bpom enabled now
*^.^*
Hop skip and a jump? :D
he cant connect with proxy.
What is he giggling about?
sweet
Saran wrap? O_o Interesting word.
Never mind.
noooothing
that was a seriously sad flood.
/me eyerolls.
It's a brand name.
Just move your little rump. - 3-
Is that a brand name or
Orh.
Oh*
First thing that came to mind.
Brand name
bah
Plastic wrap
I think he's the only person in that channel he's promoting
he must be very lonely
Drat.
Corriander?
I can barely hear you, silly.
omg a dude with a guitarr!
The herb?
hah
are these all the things you couldn't answer at the latest pub quiz? :P
Yeah.
Hmm.
How about...
Iks: that's Sketchy_Sounds
Chinwag?
XD
sounds better
Slightly!
6D;
I just learned that ham is a term for the opposite of spam
weird
lol
2,14 howdy everyone
Never heard someone use that term. Apparently informal conversation though.
sweetie deerrreeellleeeee it!
I'm not sure I trust wiki on that
but whatevs
i figured... since it says Sketchy_Sounds at the top
Let's bring out the slang.
This should be interesting. XD
Lush?
wooooo!
Hell yeah!
as a slang word? no clue
the guitar kinda drowns out the voice
/me head bops.
6A drunk person? :3
This is what Scots Gaelic sound slike!??
Nope.
Luna_In_Socks: yes. :P
I remember you saying no to that before.
is this all british slang?
It does mean drunk person, but as slang.
I don't remember what you said it was though.
saywha
Lush is the only slang I've said now.
/me looks around for FallSilently
Who?
I have slang word.
yay cmc!
/me puts on plastic moustache
Whoo ees thees FallSilently?
CMC?
/me gets out the body armor.
cutie mark crusaders!
this should be good.
learn your acronyms!
I know my acronyms
Basically it just means something good, attractive, etc.
"Amy is lush"
6Dari is lush~
sketchy is playing it on his stream
I just wondered why it is randomly said
"The salary of my new job is lush"
Etc
Ohhhhh
direct the stream to here lol http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
first time i have heard it played on a guitar
/me tries to think of something funny to say to make him burst out laughing.
VioletVanilla doesn't quite understand the usage of the term lush. At least not the version Dari is using.
1) I don't think the stream is currently running
it's the UK version VV
2) Don't advertise without permission please
6jaja~ Dari is something good
Exactly. Those words don't go in the same sentence. :p
Nonsence I think the US version works for Dari at times too,
I think he cheats by not reading this while singing.
I wanna sing with you so badly = 3=
and now the ceiling falls down on you.
probably
:D
:D
wow that's barely slang
Evil enchantress?
:o
hurrah!
6US version? o:
dont read my message!
Ohh! Yay!
you will laugh!
ahh it breaks apart!
/me 's stream is asploding
Argh! THe stream! It's dying
/me kicks the internet
D:
dumb internet.
Found another Brony on omega
Dead.
that stream is too awesome for any machine to handle it
:(
Omegle*

New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: The Elements of Gaming (Update Part 5!) (http://tinyurl.com/3wje3mc)
You're right. x.x
ustream went derp'd
dun dun DUNNN
Hi. Back from psychiatry appointment.
Sketchy stop! You're gonna blow up your stream with the power Pinkie D:
Us = Drinks alot UK = Something pleasing or desirable
Has it derped?
and dont read my message
Apparantly he didn't know about Ponychan
Yush
Pinkie Pie breaks the internets again
it seems alright now
It broke pretty badly in the first half of that.
What are you guys talking about?
US version? UK version?
So I'd call it a victory
The meaning of words.
Oh, I found a Brony on Omegle
I have slang word.
Dari starting controversy.
/me notorious!
o-o back for a moment, but brb again. Just wanted to share the pic with you. ^^;
It's dirty tho
i wanna know what hes laughing about
^^^ Dari being wrong you mean. :p
i don't, really.
i am sending him silly messages
probably read a comment somewhere
why not send them here
Lawl Dashite, being ignorant you mean?
nice work Fluttershy, or so I assume anyway
6I agree with you DE, victory! ;3
Yes, yes you are Dari. :p
because they are definitely not channel appropriate
ohoo probably something perverted
._.
Because this room is PG rated is why X
Haha, now I want to know.
Hah, that's inventive.
Nice pic Fluttershy
If olive oil comes from olives, then where does baby oil come from?
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
/me wraps her front hooves around Leika in a tight embrace
:D
6Space.
and they are only funny because they are all in caps
baby olives
lol
Where's the slang word then?
/me gasps
Yes, I drew the picture. ^^
ohay ValtheJean
/me hugs VioletVanilla.
do your arms feel any better now?
howdy robotpinkie
now I will be brbing again... d:
yessss gatg~~
cya Fluttershy
you rock... who-hoo
The pic has Fluttershy holding a hand to her stomach. For what reason, I wonder.
6See you soon fluttershy~
he is going to laugh in a second
/me hugs Fluttershy~
see
6Get well soon
Who knows barry
and we will never know why
/me hugs DeniedExistence as well
cya
I know one reason, but I doubt it's the case
Bye Fluttershy
I'm sure it's a fun comment Tavi sent him.
Haha, see you guys. And Barry, there is a reason... but I'll just leave you to speculate.
I wish I could draw...
Orly Barry? What would tgat be?
-yes, is trolling- bye for now!
hah, we have an inside joke we throw back and forth
that*
I'm guessing it's gas, Fluttershy, would that be correct?
The only reason I know is that she's pregnant
aight, I need to wash up.
Keep on playing :D
6I am happy to be able to play all of the instruments I do, even though I can not draw.
*Headphone*
lol
See yall ponies later. o3o
but like I said, I doubt that's the case
bye
I dont doubt it...
Or...maybe she's just hungry?
This is internet so only reason Human Flutterhy would be holding hand on stomach is because she's pregnant...
/me smiles
that was pretty
6Ugh. . . Human fluttershy. . . <.<
Yeah I thought that too Barry, preg that is.
6BURN IT
/me is acting like Lauren Faust
aw
wat
I see VioletVanilla.
lol Lauren Faust hates humanized ponies?
IDK
where is it VioletVanilla
lol
oh wow, i was just goint to say to play this
6I am only kidding~ Apparently in an interview Lauren Faust said she severely dislikes humanized ponies or references to humanized things in general
that sounds nice
I wonder if Lauren Faust knows of this site?
6I will have to find it. .
wait
going* even
there is a site for humanized ponies?
or am I misinterpreting hard?
6I read it on EQD
Faust only clops to ponies, clearly
I saw taht too VV Thought it was more along the lines of having them hold things as if they had hads.
0_o
6She didn't like the BridleMaids poster
6Because it was in "human-like poses"
But she has the ponies stand on two legs for prolonged periods of time. Trixie for one comes to mind
*Insert shrugpony here*
well, I can see that
she stands on two legs only for the show
and isnt for a prolonged period of time
only when there are fireworks
Hi
hi.
maybe she just hates bridesmaids :P
or whatever that show is called
Holding a bouquet of flowers with her front legs while standing on her back legs, and using her front legs to summon them like a human magician comes to mind
Eh...Well she DID play with ponies when she was young...
6JEAN VALJEAN <3
lol :P
If any thing Dash was doing human poses more then most. But only when flying/hovering.
I'm watching the Looney Tunes show. Daffy even complains about the restroom key at an office.
oh
There is one thing I would like to mention about Bronies
Ohai Val
"What, you think I'm going to steal your toilet?"
this is hard to understand when you're only getting half of the conversation.
Oh hey ValtheJean
when compared to everyone else I usually converse with
Holy shi* I just remembered!
They are all totally nuts?
Yeah?
Brony's have a significantly higher percentage of actually getting my nick reference
/me hugs Luna
we're 20% cooler, val?
today, is gonna be the dsay o/~
sorry
that too
Oh Shiitake mushrooms
I don't get it
=(
Phew
i totally got it
also ohai everyone who said hi
hi =p
Almost forgot hugs
6:3 We're just into movies and shows and stuff ;3
course we know it
Val, from Trigun?
Hellew
Barry, you're breaking the statistics curve!
No, Val Valjean.
I think he's from there, anyway
Deied.. Bunker
Denied*
roflol, Daffy stole the toilet
Hi
Did Val lose his OP...?
i don't, but i know next to nothing about music
lol
val valjean? wow, yeah I definitely didn't get it then
>yfw I've never even seen trigun
No.
Who's Val Valjean?
also that was a typo by Denied, it's JEAN ValJean
I don't think...
Ask him
he's the protagonist in Les Miserables
fine, who's Jean Valjean
only thing i think of is jean valjean, which is a reference that i imagine few get...
oh lol
ah
People don't get Jean ValJean?
maps too == opposite of spam
hey
no, they don't get ValtheJean
Val, Y U NO OP?
LOL, Les Miz. xD
because they think I'm talking about Jeans
Also, I think Valerie Jean fits better
never watched Les Miserables, but I did see Trigun a bit
=P
Val the pair of jeans.
That's why I think it was from Trigun
@Barry it's also a book :P
thought*
>watched
and oh u dari :P
hey.
lawl
lol
hi
Hi.
Back
Haro everypony
well we arent watching looney tunes we watching brony tunes
hello allis
Valthejean.. OP?
Hey Dari, I think i just found how you can start Your streaming.
ohay again AllisZero
I just thought of something. In Boast Busters, Applejack was a hypocrite.
/me likes watching Luney Tunes.
Man, I'm getting so sick right now
No purple text today Val?
Just got approved for a car loan :(
I'm disguising myself as one of you
I ninjar like that
It's the new Looney Tunes.
But I'll never buy the car I want to
but lol, Daffy actually stole a toilet
rammstein! lol
Val, I demand you show us color.. We need... Verification
What'dshe say what'd she say!!!
what?
what what did she request?
i said nothing
can you play the one from the very beginning again?
omg this is so frustrating
I take orders from nopony
that was beautiful.
New Looney Tunes ain't bad.
/me stands behind Octavia, glowering adorably
except Luna, because she's so huggable
What about Rammstein?
i said he should turn on a light
I second that motion
seriously.
aye
Certainly a thousand steps up from the things they were doing with them before.
nothing jackie... go back to looney tunes
Show us the colors
She pretty much said she didn't like people who showed off, but she went on stage to try to upstage Trixie, and showed off herself.
speaking of which
well i was kidding anyways
oh, the music itself was nice enough
/me hugs Luna
Sumica: Huh?
Sing Sea Ponies!
for pony tunes, play the Gala

What's so hard about at the Gala?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/when-she-loved-me.html#more
In a way i hope they don't do a luna ep like that. I dont think I could make it.

/me is hugged, sniffles

Good bye

*meow!*
/me is listening to Super PonyBeat
i love the chorus
Cya later, VioletVanilla
-gasps- I love the Super PonyBeat album... my favorite song is Luna (Dream Mode)
yay, this is my favorite portion
^ second
I'm currently on Fluttershy's Lullaby
Awww that one's fun too ^^
Octavia: how about recording them and then mixing them in manually next time? :D
You know, out of the CMC, Apple Bloom's the only one who hasn't sung
yeah, you did
yes, great song!
it is tricky
Not sure if want.
You don't know if you want to hear Apple Bloom sing?
technically she sang that one little quick verse in practice
yay~
but no serious songs
True, but she didn't have any singles
yay
now that's dedication
cant wait for RDs part
Correct Barry, it could go really wrong.
yay i found a pair of headphones
i have a feeling im going to have to learn to play this
Well, since Apple Bloom's VA is Sweetie Belle's singing VA, how bad could it go?
AB can't be any worse than Scoots
or maybe she could, I don't know
Nah
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG8V_rs6e7E
sketchy needs too
crap
Space Marine still hasnt arrived
Yeah they may share a va but so dose RD and AJ. people like RD's singing but not AJ's
True
really?
eeyup
imo both have good songs D:
I wonder what people have to say about Twi's singing?
johnsey|workmode, wish there was a way to better colaborate over the net
Twi's singing is fucking awesome
at least on winter wrap up
its tough with audio and video cause of the sync issues
That's really the only time she sang
<3 Winter Wrap Up song...
but isnt google working on some stuff? google wave or something
Galla?
dumb internet -.-
It and At the Gala were the only songs that featured the entire main cast
:)
suuure
Love BOTH of those songs~
Personaly I like Aj's singing but I see them having appleblloms singing being much like scoots.
You mean where the VA is forced to sing badly?
Yep
Octavia: well yeah, as long as your bandwidth and latency allows it, it should be possible
/me looks at her cellphone having a meltdown
Nope.
I really hope the developers of FiM release a correct version of the Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
and by correct, I mean with the singer using her talent, instead of being forced to sing badly
They have one they just did't use it. and yes hope it gets out to us.
johnsey|workmode!
I think it was the VA's idea to sing badly, anyway
well 3g isn't really known for good latency
oh oh oh oh
maybe
maybe
see
listen guys
maybe
why not?
maybe the cmc
whaddya want
like
kidding!
sup?
maybe they sing again
and then
see see
they do it right
you posted an awesome pinkemina pic while i was at work
i want it!
NAOW
and the song is actually good
and they get their cutie marks
!!!
eee....nope
:(
!link maid plot blood
The only way that happens is if Sweetie sings
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54735
there u go
thats what I mean
and that won't happen any time soon
if at all
Zephirdd: compose your thoughts dude =p
thanks
:D
the CMC lose their relatability once they gain cutie marks
She suffers from such a bout of stage fright it overcomes her at just the thought of performing onstage
!!!!
a mlp celestia commercial just came on!!!

national...what?
Sad but true ValtheJean, almost feels like that ep would be a shows last ep.
absolutely lovely, Sketchy
indeed
very nicely done
it's a play on National Novel Writing Month
Nah. I doubt it
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: National Pony Writing Month Update #2! (http://tinyurl.com/3t4jbx9)
back in a few, need to go start a load of laundry.
i will not make him crack up when he is playing on the classical :)
it would just be the last time the CMC were shown onscreen, I think. Once that happens, they'd just get references
I have a deep, dark secret that I'm about to reveal now.
I... love ponies.
get out
no ponies allowed here
That's not a deep, dark secret
National obviously
:(
as in, The Equestria Nation
duh
and one viewer less... g2g hit the shower
bye
A deep, dark secret is something like, say, having an embarrassing arrest record, or something
I was arrested for graffitting ponies
am i doin it rite?
Oh, well nothing like that's really happened to me.
Arrested for graffiti.
Not that I was, mind
Mine's much worse
My brother has been arrested plenty of times, since he's a bit of a retard...
:O
rawr
Zephiridd: STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
Lol
I guess I'm the white sheep of the family :(
isn't it black sheep?
oh holy guacamole commercial
lol
If you were the only one not arrested in a family of convicts...
i think i just jumped ten feet out of bed
lol if I actually did bad things, it would be black sheep
what
why?
Ok, so your brother is the black sheep
The new spoiler pic explained http://i.imgur.com/w9dAu.jpg
why cant white sheeps do bad things
why black sheeps always do bad things?!
zomg racism
lololo
lol indeed
it's because they're different :P
being a black sheep just means you're different from the others in a group
and we must hate different things :P
ari guess what?
And you're sometimes treated differently
You're different, just like everypony else.
duh
:d
It's my birthday? :o
:D
Like for example, in FiM, the mane 6 each had a talent, but only Twilight was afraid of showing off. Until Boast Busters, she was the black sheep of the group[
ari cookie's here... ummm cookie hit /nick cookie and fix ur name.
:o
no, she was the purple pony you silly
Hey
One more class to g.
haven't you seen the show?
:)
go*
Excellence.
and I mean timeline, not episode, and it's an expression
fantastic
i loved that
cookie??? hello?? lol
Look, if you were new in a group, and your friends were criticizing someone else for a talent you also had, wouldn't you be afraid of showing that talent?
oh, can you play Johnny I hardly knew ye?
Hey everypony
i have no requests, honestly. i am just enjoying
/me is confused
:o
i'd actually criticize everypony for criticizing the guy for doing what I can do
!
ah, that's okay
maybe
hi Kodiak
ohay Kodiak
;)
hey ari it is /nick to change a nickname aint it?
Well, in this case, not only was Twilight afraid of losing her friends for showing off, she was also afraid of defending Trixie for the same reason
What are you ponies talking about with the mane six?
i know terminus
<3
mhm use /nick to change your nick
I'm just trying to make Barry go crazy
!gnaw
:P
I don't think Twilight had any urge to defend Trixie, really...
I give up
Ah, that episode.
She was only doing her special talent, and the others were criticizing her for it
I was surprised they didn't keep Trixie
I'm back, and I'm speaking normally.
imo needs more trixie season 2
She had so much potential as a main character
Trixie was a showmare. That's like criticizing a stage magician for the same reason
I wasn't. I hated her and wished she'd go away :P
Zephirdd: *brohoof* Yes
And things seem to have taken a turn for the romantic.
*brohoof*
Trixie wasn't just showing off, she was willing to directly assault people.
any highlight or favorite moment of the season 1 ?
Maybe, but she did it on stage
mib_t8xeyo: /nick cookie22
well, she only did something for those who came to her first
as part of her act
and only on stage
It was less about showing off than about making others look bad
no, she egged them on
and here's the important part
so the confusion ends. lol
oh
She issued challenges, and the others stepped up to take them
she STOPS performing when people start admiring her
true true
she was doing it for attention
if she was a showmare, the show would have continued after the challenge
oohh, that was very nice
thank you, Sketchy_Sounds
thanks for performing!
Enjoyed what I heard, good man!
True, there are bad eggs in show business
thanks again, Sketchy
but that's the same everywhere
Thanks for tuning in =)
yeah, so she was a bad egg
and thus deserved the punishment she got
and doesn't deserve the rediculous amounts of sympathy she gets
She didn't deserve to have an Ursa minor destroying her equipment
Now I can listen to the Luna thing on the blog page. I'm going to bloody cry.
it stopped her from showing off :P
Going AFK
idk, ever since I read that fic where Trixie is Twilight's younger sis
lol she was pretty much asking for that
Probably not
I've liked her
She probably gets enough money from her acts to afford a whole new set of equipment
even though fics have nothing to do with the show
.-.
/me pokes mib_t8xeyo
which luna thing
:)
cyrils song is boss
as the saying goes, "The show must go on".
the vid posted on eqd
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/when-she-loved-me.html#more That one probably
assuming she's a showmare in the first place
And she only issued the challenges anyway because of the neigh-sayers, as she said
Oh gosh, I'm watching it now
It was posted about half an hour ago. It's Jessie's song from Toy Story 2. One of the epicest
Quick question if I might my good ponies, does anypony know where I could get a hoodie with the Elements of Harmony on it?
and not just an egocentric bitch who feeds off of the stupidity of others
;~;
... epicest Disney songs ever, and really sad.
thats a disney song?
/me facepalms
If Twilight and the others just enjoyed the show, instead of criticizing it, it would have been a normal routine for her
It's from Toy Story 2
Trixie sucks.
oui
Twi did't want to show here up cause they are systems =p
Jessie's song
i dont remember
'dat video. It reminds us what tears feel like.
cookie?
what is this madness? Dari agrees with me???? WHAT IS HAPPENING?
sisters even
and i think of pixar being seperated from disney
mew
Sometimes the episodes have broken aesops
holy mole.
this.. sad
Eeyup.
I don't really mind Trixie, but Barry is really making me not want to like her right now...
noooo
/me wipes her eyes
Not the saddest I've heard, but...top 10, definitely.
Wait you hate her cause some one else likes her?
/me barely avoids crying
I'm only saying that she issued the challenges because twi and the others criticized her
mib_8kz65f: look over here too.
well, now i have a new song to learn
Twi never said anything bad :P
That's pretty much the opposite of what I said, Sumica
oh dear. and i break so easily...
Hmm, Top 5, even.
True as that may be, she didn't stop the others, either
so she's guilty by association
Complete and utter nonsense.
Ah yes clearly i am blind
/me pokes ari
so suddenly inaction means guilt? that's a justice system I would love *sarcasm*
this is ur fault ari. the sites all complicated and stuff.
Sometimes it's worse to say nothing, than to try to stop others
Some states have that law ValtheJean
say and do*
07Stream's up
Good sameratin laws
lol Sumica, then those states deserve to burn :P
She didn't show them up at their own game, she physically attacked them, Barry.
Twi was having a crisis of identity, and so now she's culpable for something that happened?
But it's more of If you watch a crime happen and dont do any thing about it.
that's idiotic
ValtheJean: watch the final two episodes of Seinfeld. ;p
watching some one die and not calling for help and so on.
so I could be arrested for not charging a man with a gun?
You could be
Sketchy you make my little sister cry
good samaritan laws
hey brownies
You could be charged with a crime for not reporting a crime.
hey Ziltoid
Actually, you could be arrested for not calling the police on that guy
He's not that terrifying, is he?
You dont have to try and stop it just report it happend.
and I was ninja'd
Pfffft XD
Sweet streams
because Twi wasn't witnessing the other 5 gang banging trixie
/me likes this one
Pretty sure he means becuase of the link ;p
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo2448-AhFI&feature=player_embedded
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
>rolling your eyes at a braggart is apparently now the same as an actual crime
wut
yes was for that :P
but she did witness and do nothing when Trixie used her magic to assault her friends. Some friend she is
>not stopping your friend from rolling her eyes = guilt by association
You guys stream house yet?
I admit she's still learning the ins and outs of friendship
Varying levels of guilt. But Guilt non the less.
omg courage
nope, House hasn't been yt
Courage is the only dog I would ever want to have as a pet
because they werent cute and adorable?
Hello VampirePrincess
07House will start after Courage
Courage will save your ass no matter what
and yay, thx Luna!

Ah the computer
It linked me to an MGMT song.
meh its a cover and still blocked in germany
"Unfortunately, this SME-music-content is not available in Germany because GEMA has not granted the respective music publishing rights. "
copy the URL and put it into hidemyass.com
huh, it is a pure cover, too
fascism doesnt care
i assume youtube is doing the matching automatically
so the cover was probably close enough to the original to be recognized
/me pokes cookie22 "talk, silly, or they'll think i'm dtaing a mute. lol"
poor poor doogie
i once uploaded a 15 sec clip of seaquest to youtube... was blocked in 5 minutes
I like screwing up people's badly asked questions: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9897526/kittens.JPG

weird, so FiM isn't going to air on CN here as was originally said
octavia battle theme go
omg.
Where is here RobotPinkie?
Sweden
two cookies? I think I'm in heaven
gr.
I think Boomerang is covering most of the overseas stuff.
the site keeps throwing him off. not sure why.
can we have five next?
They are a part of CN
lolol
so I'm guessing I missed the beginning of the latest House season, huh?
he's all mine.
anything interesting happen with the guy who shot him?
/me is very greedy with her cookie
I want a toaster that also makes fried eggs
invent it. :D
those eyes
it probably already exists
I think he died?
I dint catch the beggining either
"most of he overseas stuff"?
Yeah as in not in the US.
i've nvr heard of one.
Ah, you mean specifically for FiM, I guess
Yeah
oh
oh dear
normally Boomerang airs only retro shows, here, so that's kinda weird
inb4 he dies
Strangely quiet in here.
he falls on the cake
I'm calling it
Gah, DC got me nicklocked, brb
nice
lol Ralphy
oh okay, I was close
even better ValtheJean
inb4 he tears a hole in space time and uses telekinesis to rip the engine off an airpl.... oh nvm
There we go
oh shit
Is he still streaming?
nope
That's probably why.
Ah.
ominous silence
What's Luna streaming?
that would be House
indeed
>yfw I already moved one episode to my ps3 on a huge screen, and the quality looks better than on my computer
(Darryl is my real name, and what I use on a different server)
Yeah Boomerang dose the same here RobotPinkie but for what I have seen other areas have MLP on boomerang.
Ah
House, season 3 episode.... 8?
just like here in the office
RobotPinkie: What was that?
Never seen it before
07correct
Hey now, some of us are trying to focus on FreeCell!
Hm, hm...
lol it was a semi-obscure reference, WhatPayne :P
I'm up to 52% success!
no one else left but me :p
Indeed
because of the guy in the bunny suit....
ohai everypony
Oh hai Starshine.
n__n
How are you?
I am quite fine.
That's good to hear~
Why is it so quiet right now?
Really? Nothing? No accolades? No triumphal parades? I'll have you know FreeCell is a very difficult mindless game!
fuck that cop
o__o
have a good day, everypony. I must be going.
Bye-bye Octavia.
Bai bai Octavia

Hey
love that movie, btw... though way too much of the story was revealed only through the riddle stuff...
I was just about to comment on that sumica :P
urgh just been playing Limbo
Hay?
Just wondering if anypony here is also a member of Bloomberg's Treehouse?
Mike Bloomberg has a treehouse?
RobotPinkie: What movie is that?
xD
Silly filly~
hihi bro
hi
:)
whats up?
Well, he probably has a couple houses.
Donnie Darko
good movie
lol
u missed it... i tried to get cookie on... he was ahving technical difficulties...
Never seen that one... Any good?
D'aww
having*
way to trick the kids house
Would you guys believe that I already have EP 11 on my ps3, and that the quality is better than on my computer?
Never seen a video get better quality on a much larger screen
even if you end up not liking it, it's a movie that you should probably see once
:3 sucks
whats ew in yer life?
I'd recommed it, WhatPayne, though I'd also recommend going through the wikipedia entry AFTER watching the movie.
lol, sorry if I dont respond to your message, but I am using my backup compie, and the proc sucks
People disappearing
and im doing like 100 things on it at once
;__;
hm? :D
Come back, everypony!
sonds like the quality was good already but now you can see it.
lol
lol yeah, what ValtheJean said. some people really don't like it
I should be doing homework right now...
u got a server dont you? i'm thinking its mibbits fault. oh its okies but tht really long email i sent pretty much said it all.
do they have the hub watermarks Pinkie_Pie?
cookie=my man. new bf
btw.
:)
Ohai Nuclear
I have FIM season 1 w/o watermarks...
Ohey
LOL
damn cameron can be such a bitch sometimes
how is it hard to join an irc server
I mean seriously
POLO!
although I really wouldn't recommend mibbit
:D
it kept throwing him off. not his fault.
WHY SO SERIOUS?!
oh hay dari
i have the 720p vids without watermarks.. really hoping for blu ray set :(
mibbit sucks
hey it works for me.
i would be all over a blu-ray set
^same ones
I would just run PJIRC on a webserver on your local machin
mchine
yeah same here.
of couse, if you could do that, you might aswell download an irc client
but PJIRC is a lot better
than mibbit, that is
what cud i recommend to cookie?
I'd pay moneys for Season 1 Blu-Ray boxset.
Watermarks?
like send me a link to refer him to.
lol, every brony would :P
The colours are lighter
exept not
no box-set
watermarks would be like the Hub logo.
OH SHI-
blasting from all holes

that is easier in python
:D
there are particular shots where certain characters are missing and whatnot
very nit-picky mind you
but there are inconsistencies
nah, you can see it all the words run into each other on one giant line!
The itunes ones have a slightly faided color commpared to the hub versions
wait what layers?
iunno
probably dead
take, for example, the fear song
the shot where everyone is laughing
The version I have is more than just slightly faded colors
Lol
SO HOW ABOUT THAT DVD HUH
fluttershy and rainbowdash are missing
I could never get into python, the white space thing just irked me
How do I know what version I have?
iunno
White space thing?
SO HOW ABOUT THAT DVD HUH
like, indentations?
i really hope it has some good special features
where you have to have specific amounts of white space
D:
o.o
ah
You said something about missing layers? Any specific examples?
it would help to see a comparison shot or something
Wait, what language was that snippet you just posted in?
*walks into bronystate just in time for butt stab*
see the fear song example
[lo:ng:ti:me:ago] *Cat1 dies
:3
Hey guys, I see it's life as usual
lol butt stab?
well, many languages, but I was implying C
Lawl
it was a thread on ponychan, but I'm sure it's 404'd by now
butt stab must always be seem
ah okay
Dash is missing?
so it's better to have the watermarked versions, if you care about stuff like that?
/me ponders about wondering why his 2 irc servers keep splitting
Fuck the itunes version.
eeyup
lol
/me deletes
Hey, Everypony!
lol i see her fine in my 720p version...
Hm? I'm here. I'm drawing. o-o
Why are your names so similar
And watching House.
OW
Heya!
That little girl is the most mature person on this show :0
:p
I must learn how to program this delicate piece of silicon.....
lawl
/me restores from recyle bin
Ok.
He has everything
If Dash is still there it's all good.
The kid has EVERYTHING.
Silicon...?
GET ALL THE DISEASES!
Applejack and Rarity isnt in the shot where they all fall down laughing
Oh damnit... I have Itunes versions.
LUPUS!
In my version
Well it is silicon
I am gonna have to check that ValtheJean
Program...?
Silicon with logic gates.....
Hi Herospirit
meh, then maybe I remember the specifics wrong
Why in the world is the Itunes version different than the normal one?
but there are still missing characters
OHAI PINKIE.
/me breaks silence with a radio.
Okay
:O
http://i.imgur.com/mNI4B.jpg
But why, Payne, why
oooohhh
it was THAT shot
So what's up? I'm not always able to visit Equestria Daily as often as I'd like, so what's been going on recently?
thanks whatpayne
why are they missing?
missing layers
the joys of using flash
I always wondered why that shot had RD and Fluttershy missing...
most of the animation errors in FiM is related to flash being retarded
Dash IS missing.
/me deletes again
Mmmm
lol
Wellll...
Ponies have been going on, talky
uh oh...did I just opena canof worms?
though as to why the itunes version has more inconsistencies, I have no idea
Really*
lol
untz untz untz
Damn you swype
maybe it's because they sent them the wrong base files? I dunno
Dash is missing in one shot? Dari deletes it
so, how about that dvd
Now the question is: Where can I find best quality versions?
:p
weird
either way, it's still a rip-off to pay for episodes on itunes
Guess mine is't the itunes version then, cause i see all but Rarity and AJ.
yah that shot is definitely with missing layers in the 720p version I have
I have Winter Wrap Up stuck in my head... ^w^;
guess I'm downloading the version with crappy hub logos and stuf, then :(
asuming I am looking at the right snot.
I'm holding off downloading the episodes because I still cling to the dying belief that they will release dvds
*giggle* the right snot.
Hi
uh oh, explosion! aaagh
dvds... :(
My internet dropped earlier. :(
or blu rays
:[
I don't care
I just want them on some sort of cd
i care!
??
Then welcome back, JackiePie
lol
Thanks
"Winter wrap up, winter wrap uuuuppp..." =_=;
Val would buy a bluray player just for Ponies.
its nah a tumor
/me sits in the corner, blinks.
I have a ps3 so that's settled for me. BUT, I would if I didn't :P
LUPIS EVERYWHERE
Herospirit, I have the same version as Dari, I intend to delete..
Lupus*
Someone somewhere has proper versions.... Has to be
anypony here with a PS3 and Borderlands?
i'd buy a real pony if i got a blu ray of FiM season 1 with it...
:OO
That doesn't mean I can't give Dari a hard time for doing a reasonable thing :P
/me lights Cat on fire
I'd buy ANYTHING if it came with a FiM season 1 blu ray with commentaries :P
Hasbros new marketing department.. Real ponies
Proper versions of MLP? I downloaded the 720p versions without any watermarks. They're nice.
Lol
suddenly stream cut off for me
They are nice but color is faided Fluttershy
The colors look fine to me.
o-o
/me burns her hand on cat.
ow
seems to work fine now lol
/me nibbles on Cat
Habro is spray-painting horses as we speak
Hmmm... I torrented mine though. =w=;
D=
u lit him on fire how u nibbling him?
Where can I download the version with dash in the highest possible quality?
i'm definitely never watching the 720p versions again... because i'm quite gay for not having missing stuff.... :P
Filesize is not an issue..
Look at an ep side by side with a youtube version Fluttershy
it adds extra flavor
hey everypony! Just wastin some time before class. What's up?
RobotPinkie: Same here, I'm just furious
lol wow
nothing
stuff~
lol, I should never have mentioned it >.<
wait... both nothing and stuff?
haha, no it's good, ValtheJean
lol
Homeowrk and a headache.
ValtheJean: Thanks for this, really I had no idea
I don't want to admit to being sick or else I may really become sick.
@Sumica I'll do that but it's still not a big issue to me if the colors are somewhat faded o-o
Not if you admit it, and take care of it before it gets bad
Unless it's a virus, then there's really nothing you can do.
it's not like anyone lost anything from knowing that :P
...except for their innocence, of course
It's not the colours, but now I can't be sure if there is actual missing content.
to tell you the truth I have never noticed any thing missing.
well, Dari lost a bit of stuff due to a somewhat unrelated deletion :P
Fight the sickness!
lol
I have a strong immune system. Most sicknesses I feel and it wears me down but it doesn't make me bedridden.
you wont be missing anything SIGNIFICANT
just background layers and such
so for example, some missing ponies
/me goes for a lie down
none of which are the main focus of the shot
:3
BUT RAINBOW DASH IS MISSING IN ONE SHOT
IT CANNOT BE TOLERATED
Don't have sugar... even if it is sweet and yummy
SUDDENLY PONIES
I SAW CARAMEL DANSEN
/me is playing: 692. Down With The Sickness  Disturbed  The Sickness  4  4:38 - 128kbps
I DEMAND IT BE PLAYED
wtf 128 kbps?
God I wish it's the 17th already!
I know, but I'm not really that bothered by hub logos
lol don't with the sickness
oh yes! me too!
/me pets cat
I'm super psyched!
hewwo.
!s2
:)
Season 2 begins in 9d:16h:14m:54s
I'm eating fruits.
Which ones?
ill put up with logos and such till the retail release i think
dose kinda make me want to look for a side by side of the altered shots.
I ultra psyched
inb4 bannana
I wonder if it'll be available immediately online...
128 kbps ftw, that is horrible
ftl8
I don't have cable.. :(
DJ-PON3
coolio
aren't I still on fire?
What?
Ionnan: look them up when they comr up on youtube
...
Hmm slightly faded possibly but the colors are still very bright
I am a big fan :D
I want to know where I can download the non itunes version, preferably all 26 episodes in one folder
@DJ
Aww, thanks.
XD
suddly mouse flys acorsss the screen
:3
well i got those files like.... 10 years ago or so
Mamoncillo. It's a tropical fruit.
I believe there's a stickied thread on ponychan
/me puts u out first the gives u tea then pets u
Im serious about re downloading.. I have to have my ponies in perfect condition
:P
specifically /pony/
oh! gtg guys! have fun
I have no idea how to find a thread on there
I have never used a chan site before
Link pl0x
I'll grab it for you
Pinkie_Pie: I torrented all 26 eps o-o it took 'em a while to download but it was worth it
The one I downloaded was 19gb
I just went to Pirate bay for mine.
lolol
Anyone wanna do the Carlton to Robots_FTW with me when S2 comes out?
Pirate Bay here too =w=;
Same
was gonna follow in your footsteps.. DJ-PON3. but.. it's not the life for me unfortunately. But, the DJ life seems quite interesting and fun.
i just went to google for mine...
Yes, it's the truth... I, Fluttershy... torrented. -hangs her head-
Kersha they look like grapes. I searched them on Wikipedia.
Ok?..
!moon
Grab my tail, Iks!
But it's not that easy to know which ones are itunes and which ones are tv rips
hihi everypony
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35803447.html
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x_tx5K5wgU
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Thanks Arch Demon
Twilight told me this video is about EVERYONE&#39;S REACTION TO THE PORTAL 2 COUNTDOWN
It has a hard shell though, like a lychee. The flavor ranges between bitterly sour to tangy and sweet.
Farly sure the Itunes one are the ones without water marks
Hey again.
Replace that to "SEAON 2 COUNTDOWN"
iTunes ones are only 720p, right?
SO LET'S ALL DO THE CARLTON WHEN SEASON 2 COMES OUT K? :D
Oh, you changed the topic I see.
*season
Shad :3
no clue
hey
so a good way to get he right version, just search for 1080p, i'd guess...
Have I missed anything in here?
After Dark gets lonely.
.. >_>
lol
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
I downloaded mine from youtube
after dark gets awesome
/me is sad
/me hugs Luna
/me hugs Luna. D:
SummerRain: 'ello

-gasps- N-no don't squish her...!
><
We will be gentle
3 months?
Of winter coolness?
how does afterdark get awesome?
yes
:C
So yeah, I'll be (possibly recording myself) doing the Carlton around hte time season 2 comes out (and upload it to youtube)
/me hugs Fluttershy instead
if its appropriate
*the
/me is hugged, squeaks. o_o
when the convo isn't about 18+ stuff -.-
yeah..
I could change the conversation to something that isn't 18+ if I was allowed there. *forever alone*
Oh man, I'm so sick
So who all is singing the son in there head right now thanks to dari?
yeah
/me is 13, not 18
Me
i need food
im not old enough to get in there. believe me, wouldnt want to either.
who isn't, is a better question..
*either
eh nod fod
eeyup
:)
What is the chance of a Blu-Ray sometime in the near future..?
I'm gonna go "you rock, woohoo" and "yay" when season 2 comes out lol
I thnk we have a traitor in our midst!
HELL YES
/me dances
maybe some "oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh" as well lol
I think a DVD set is VERY likely sometime soon
lawlsss
O:
DVD isnt good enough. Blu-Ray
if they are smart there will be a set.
Blu Ray set, realistically, I'd say is pretty low...
I'll be doing the Carlton.
:p
oh man not this one
Wouldnt there be a large quality loss if it was on DVD?
I just need a fitting pony-related song.
Hi
So much Pinkie... o-o
They are smart, which is why there will be a DVD set :P
what is this?
not sure there's enough money in a Blu Ray set for them to care
well i guess im gonna head off
this is Caramelldansen, DecapKing
not a lot of activity
I can't get this stuck in my head right now. Because this is stuck in my head. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qp_nMntvR8
in fact if they were realy smart there would be a ad for it on the 17th at around 615am pst.
and i got a story to write
hold on
Lost connection for a second.
Rumour has it that DVD's have already surfaced here and there...
lemme check Equestria study
they released shit dvds with only 2 episodes on them
Best RP here ever so far.
herospirit: SOOO AWESOME
in other words, pissed every brony off
the dvd's paired with toys
...? ...*
Eeeeyup, for the kiddies
I know right, Doctor Freeze?
Hi Boombox. Just talking about last night.
they'll do a pretty good DVD set, I'd bet...
In this episode, House treats the clown in the park for botulism
The father is going to get hurt because we expect the kid to.
... ... ...*
How's the trixie fix coming?
Talking about Pony related songs
Fic*
Damn, I lose
... ...*
/me is now torn between downloading the non itunes version or waiting to see if they get a Blu-Ray
Lawl
WHAT DO?
// ...*
that'
Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam
that's it?
is that good?
Glad to hear that.
you scream, you ruse
Dari I'm blaming you for my failure
:(
Hey DecapKing
Because you are the master troll.
/me runs out of the room beeping really fast about something
THE MASTER
blu ray probably isn't happening
I need a pony MIDI file, so I can have music in my Pony related SM64 stage
I'll just go hang myself then.
Clearly no one likes me.
get now Pinkie_Pie then buy dvd when/if.
:'(
/me shrugs.
Okay, time to go get dinner
hey DE
And take my Stats homework with me so I do it.
Apparently there are proper 720p proper versions w/o watermarks
Dari, I obviously highly respect your trolling abilities.
:P
Trololo
Anyway, got homework to do.
...
dat house
uh twice proper
I'll buy the blu ray if they release it
proper as in?
Does anyone know if anyone made any MIDI files on any of the music featured on the show?
Tell the truth: Did you jack off during or after Emerald's fun?
as in all layers...
@Luna I put my livestream up again... o-o
even if it's a region A locked bullshit release
I already have all 26 episodes in HD MKV h.264x
So THAT'S why they didn't have a laser pointer before.
... no missing Dash
But it seems to be missing some shots
07wll put you on after this ep :)
well, for later xP
So, should I redownload..
i dont need to jack off, i have a slutty girlfriend for that
alright :P
I will check the torrent first before final recommendation
Yeah....SURE
Mutany?
So did you GG help you with that then?
Gf*
haha if anypony were to listen to me now they'd see me watching House on here. Real exciting, eh? d:
Lol

Will do!
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Comic: Muffin In the Oven (http://tinyurl.com/3shc528)

Second^
lawl, asking if I helped XD
Well it's only Lupus the one time they all guess it's not of course
So we have plaques around the school for students who've been to the school then gone on to be in high up/important jobs.
One of the plaques.
The job.
I wonder who that comic is staring
Can you guess what it was?
i want to side by side them now.
>_> lol
Did it say 4knocks?
Doctor
is that a gory one
or a cute one
http://www.cracked.com/blog/write-your-own-house-episode/
My school only had plaques to show the names of all the people from the school that died in WWI and WWII
^ Oh, we have that too
it's... kind of creppy and cute at the same time
guacamole
No, you should just remove them at will
No one even going to guess what job the guy had? :P
Well *Crosses arms* I know I did.
and come on. you never jack off, ever? really Decap?
..
>_>
*Smug look*
how so
my school had shots for the filming of back to the future on the wall.s
heh. During or after, Denied?
i didnt say i never jack off, i just dont do it as much
8
Did you though?
*creapy
o.o @ second comic
no
It's not creepy, as much as it's a cute misunderstanding of how babies are born.
I would literally stab this guy in the eye with a frozen squirrel.
ow was babby formed
During obviously. I didn't really have anything better to do...
*how
I would stab a squirrel with a frozen this guy
Well.
Anyway.
Derpy thought that babies came out of the oven.
The job was the Queen's gynaecologist.
xD
O.o
So what was it Dari?
0.o
lawl, true. and you were in bed anyway iirc.
Probably because when parents talk about babies, they'll say "Yeah one's in the oven"
momma always told me Storks carried babies to famillies!
XD
LOLWUT
lol
lol wow
And he went to my school.
Brb, getting glasses fit.
Anyone have the screencap of Lauren Faust saying on DA that they have kids the natural way? With a reply something of "LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE?!"
ohai <3
We've had some pretty important people come from my school.

A prime minister.
An Archbishop of Canterbury
!link word_of_Faust children
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
!link word_of_Faust kid
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
hum
maybe I mispelled something
We've had the first, not the second though.

Maybe you shouldn't use underscores

So you've had not a crook and...
wut

and Jesus' proctologist
lawls

Richard Nixon? Hah.
jease mom
Who's Elvira?
I am now depressed over a few little animation errors, what the heck is wrong with me -.-
we all are Pinkie Pie
everytime someone wanted a link of faust they used them
although animation errors gave us derpy
Thats a relief, but for now I must halt moving MLP to my ps3..
!link word_of_Faust

http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/6169
That is true
google "Elvira mistress of the dark"

dari: i think it's Elvira, Mistress of the Dark - https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cassandra_Peterson
But it also ripped Rainbow Dash from us for unacceptable periods of time
away from chat :3

Hi, again

Hello decapking. Glad to hear that
lol I just read those 2 comics on EqD
Two-Bits: Did you read the log yet?
hey barry

Polarfire: http://miburl.com/oxvfLq
Oh I found it.

Derpy x Oven
since he rebooted, or whatever
yeah
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/comic-muffin-in-oven.html
which explains the Luna vs the Microwave... perhaps he was just shy?
Hehehehe, my new prescription sunglasses make my screen look all 3d
So what happened yesterday Dari?
Why...?
Server derp?
lol
Windows automatic update.
aaah.

>_>
hey Luna
LEVERAGE
LEVERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG i missed that LEVERAGE
you missed being part of the live studio audience, after all
FUUUU
RD might go for Meta Knight since he's the most broken character in the game
:(
exactly
DAT HOUSE
since she hates losing
House rage
HOUSE SMASH!
xD
Was I even here when this happened?
ME GUSTA LASER POINTER PEN!
Because if I wasn't, no logs.
HOUSE UNLEASHES RAGE
i think twi would go for marths technical metagame
The topic has the log in it
lol, I never knew House was so mean
/we/ logged it ^_^
It's a pastebin
/topic
Nice sarcasum
he said it was Windows automatic updates shafting us
iirc
MFW 1500 lines
is that some kind of ice cream flavor?
xD
wait...
i'm dumb
Yeah, a lot of stuff happened
srsly?
/me somehow failed to read the lines between 'disappointed. and ':P'
it was.... interesting
House will crush you emotionally in 10 seconds flat
heh.
herospirit: D: that's terrible...
am i the only one surprised that silver hasnt joined his own channel yet?
But true.
Oh I bet it was DecapKing. xD
:<
He did it, not me!
How dare you try to comfort a child.
/me shrugs.
xD
hi
o hey, Silvermane's online. yeah sometimes he doesn't always join
alright.
@pokedmeter Spot
bout to go over to my moms house.
My god shes turning in to twoface.
oh, no magnets
be back in about an.... hour.
lol Sumica
At least not right away
lol
Give her a BIONIC ARM
but not a wife arm
Her limbs are augmented.
We have the technology
rofl
I like that cure
BIONIC- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRM
damn hes pissed
^
<3
ok well will cut right here
sunshine and puppies sound much better than amputation :(
and here and here
So GGgala, knowing Emerald now, would you still have gone with Dashite if he was available?
CUT CUT CUT
Cya.
cut her in half!
I'll probably be gone then. :(
poor kid
xD
I'd only use my bionic arm for good!
D:
Quick get Dr Solomin in here
for sleep?
Had a bit of a blackout there.
Yeah.
Good = punching through walls and snapping people's necks right?
ah.
eyup
he's good at bifurcating kids.
This is the scalpel and this is the bone drill and THIS IS MY CHAINSAW ARBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBR
maybe if House was in better shape this wouldn't have happened... but oh well, it's so worth it to teach him a lesson.
well, If you are... good night <3
Dari-bear
"light bulb"
Oh my goodness
chase has a house moment
If I'm not there when you get back then night.
...that feels like a truck question
/me silently curses timezones. And the atlantic ocean.
6Dat Chase~
...trick...
and Chase goes down
House PUNCH
Oh, hey all.
PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE
Hello!
Night.
Oh just answer you silly filly.
<3
When are the ponies?
I must be getting more imploite by the day, I almost forgot to say hi.
Show me your moves!
good night
<3
in 9 days
the ponies are in 10 days
And then it was too late to stop the surgery.
eeyup
ponycountdown.com
I'll be back, then.
So the kid is a vampire?
I'm not sure if it's entirely impolite here.
probably
well we have movie night also, GenoGaron
Where people have a tendency to come and go within seconds.
with SOME pony...
Now I just need to get Dari's opinion.
If everyone stopped to say "hi" and "bye" to everyone else, there'd be no time for ponies, see...
hey VioletVanilla
and pony videos, and stuff
He's not the dad!
pony stuff
Wait, are you saying you would have picked me?
lol
Yeah
05meh, i still call lupus
Lol both of them, so they don't fight
Some of us are playing a game in the other window too
I wonder what we're watching during Tomorrow's live broadcast?
Hurg
/me creates a season 2 folder on his laptop
Hub mostly
@Barry the Hub, and then some other channels afterwords
Other window?
ah
My headmeats, they hurt
Personally, I never say hi when I join, unless someone greets me. I don't want to interrupt the conversation, and wait to see what's being said before saying anything. But that's just me.
well till people get sick of it at least.
Chase needs to drown his rage in peanut butter
IT WAS LUPUS!
Loony Loopy Lupin
4http://miburl.com/XHh1se
uuuuuh
What time is tomorrows broadcast? Same time?
4pm EST
cheers

/me shrugs
Try saying "Loony Loopy Lupin" five times fast
hi
Hello!

Hah!
O_O
It's nice to be nice.
Funny

noooninuninoopin
Eh'tu
Guess what I'm about to say
It's Et Tu
You going to answer Dashite's question GGgala?

Uhh.
Et tu, Brute?
Hmm.
AJ!
I don't know Silvermane. :P
xD
STREAMCEPTION
Oh dear.
hurp
DURRRRRGGGGGAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR (because I haven't said that in a while)
it was first used when Brute betrayed Ceaser, I believe
there's no harm in trying anyway :D
lolololol
You need a new password, pal.
lolwat?
:p
Brutus

ohay Fluttershy

WHO DIVIDED BY 0
STREAMCEPTION
how's things?
OMG THE STREAMCEPTION
Heh.
:O
oh dear
Adding insult to injury, eh server?
OOOH MYYY GOOOOOOOOOOG
THE STREAMCEPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So much stream.
Fluttershy's streaming
I told you about doing that to the universe
Shame on you and your nuts and bolts.
QUICK GET OUT OF THE UNIVERSE BEFORE IT EXPLODES!!!!!!!!
DING<>!
draw us a pony please :3
WHAT THE HELL
Now how'd that even happen. It looked fine to me.
Hi, Fluttershy
What are we watching a stream of?
Haro
The stream.
i'm tripping out man
I SEE MY MESSAGES!
It's a stream of the stream.
We're watching a stream of the stream
Of the stream.
a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a strem
of the stream.
We are watching Fluttershy streaming through Lun's stream
ninja'd again!
some clients are weird, i guess
of the stream
Quick! Find me the Inception noise button!
eeyup. had to do something
I think the stream at the end is waving at me
5I can see FOREVEEEERRRR
wait, this is fluttershy?
05hmm
total mindfuck
Yes Silvermane
Hey Fluttershy
(the answer is also eeyup)
/me hugs Fluttershy. "BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HUGGED ANYONE TODAY"
Ohai Fluttershy :3
FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY
And that's why I always do that in the GeekShed window.
:P
Reasoning?
Don't worry, Lilfut, I doubt anybody cares.
^
^^
haven't seen him in that before
and why i use autoidentify
Yup
some one ask for inception horn?
/me hugs Silvermane. "...because I already hugged Fluttershy."
i can even typo accidentally
http://inception.davepedu.com/
/me strolls into the chat casually
And that's how Equestria was made
In what!
lol
?
4http://miburl.com/4ROCIN
RP
that kind, i mean
*can't
derp
mwahahahaa
thank you sumica
Equestria has more origin stories than the Joker.
I bet 98.3% of them are asleep anyway.
/me hugs Fluttershy
I know this might be blasphemy to some, but the Galaxy Girls cartoon Lauren's been working on, doesn't seem half bad.
Make noises
/me eats a bagel
...why would that be blasphemous?
/me hugs Herospirit "...SO ALONE"
she does a cartoon about them now? cool
or ponies
i can have some bagel SilverMane?
/me hugs Herospirit
I don't have much opinion on it, but I wish her the best of luck with it.
*Pinkie Pie points at her cutie mark* Wanna know how I got these scars?
because it's all bad? ;-)
(haven't seen anything of it)
<3
I thought some people would be like "No! Lauren should have stayed with ponies!"
Oh, I casnt draw
D'Awwwww....you wanted Dashite to please you....
So its true that she isn't working on FiM anymore/
<3
She's still watching over it.
?*
/me feeds herospirit to decapking. "It's a bagel! I swear!"
She's like executive producer or something now.
She can do more than one thing at once, you know.
Well, that's good. They can't pick up the idiot ball and run with it without some effort then.
/me hugs herospirit as well
Her independent project is very nice. She doesn't plan on making it an animated show anyways.
Keep drawing
Eat me to gain my courage, decap
/me hugs Luna. Because Luna. Also, NMM, but for now Luna
uuuh i like drawings
Lies, multitasking is a myth.
Oh, I thought she was going to do that?
what i meant to ask for was a cookie SilverMane
So she's just selling dolls?
She WAS executive Producer. Season 2, she's Creative producer, and she won't have her name on season 3.
herospirit never say it taht way again.
Also more <3 for Violet :3
sorry, out of cookies
/me hugs Nightmare Moon
Ziltoid, I want a 10 page essay on why you think Fluttershy is best pony
/me hugs Luna because i havent done that in a while
Why not do both?
>_>
...Sumica what are you taliking abo-
...
lol i went to pick up my cousin from after school club wearing my derpy hoody and some little kids recognised it and started giggling
Oh gog I'm sorry
i thought it was assistant producer?
oh, you
YeahDolls and a book I think, once she gets enough pages done.
gog?
lol, like a baws insertcupcake
I saw the book, that's cool then.
so i never play hack n slash
but that pony level in diablo 3 sure is enticing
InsertCupcakes you have a derby hoody? D'awwwwwww
unlike us poor fanboys and fangrrls the people who actually *make* the show probably aren't that obsessed and have career plans you know :-)
well im jelly, Fluttershy
yeah
hey, mind if you guys help me a bit?
^
Its my new favourite piece of clothing
WOOOOO
draw a flying carrot!
heh you are like Light, just with dramatic drawing instead of writing.
Google Docs, y u being difficult.
Lilfut: when I saw it I almost hurtmyself with happiness :P
you can't hear it on your end, but I'm pressing that inception button at _very_ comical times
its obvious its complete MLP reference
just look at boss names
3In wonderful green.
and yet i hate the entire hack n slash genre
double streambow all the way across the stream
WHAT DO
heh.
3And back on the laptop
nice to see you off the phone again :D
think of yourself as pinkamena on rampage
sure, why the fuck not
I might have to make use of that button later on ValtheJean,
Streambow Dash
streambow't willie
d3 needs to be online all the time, so i probably will not buy it
LONG STORY SHORT: i need to pick ONE picture of rainbow dash for that vote on my homework yesterday
see Sumica, I even pressed it to your comment :P
3Yep
You mean... that right there is... you can do better on paper... WAT
it works for everything!
playing it on the other hand… <_<
Altho i might scare the ever livving crap out of people.
hi
DA name?
Hi.
6Five minute perspective drawings ready? go! :3
PONI
PONIES
classes all over?
I was at first annoyed with the online thing but looking into it I understood why they did it.
well, I do like ponies
Guys, I have a confession. I like ponies.
3Yeah
Hmm
POAHNEEES
^
Me too!
No wai!
oh dude
WAT Silvermane?
Et tu, Blizzard?
because they forgot pirates can turn it off?
05Looking good Fluttershy. :D
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh silverman why didn
Guys,guys
I know, it's weird and all, but there it is
I love ponies
FUCK YOU ENTER KEY
excellent
sure, i can understand it too… but my connection is stupid sometimes
I AM SO JEALOUS OF YOU FLUTTERSHY!
3What part are you up to?
It is cold
yeah, that IS fuckin' weird, Silvermane
You know what would be cool, is if Lauren made a Play & Read version of the Galaxy Girls book for Nook.
MAKING ME POST STUFF TOO EARLY
It's basically to prevent exploitation of items online to rig the real cash/game gold market.
You can put little animations in it and stuff.
6Love it Fluttershy!
There is a dinstict lack of food I can warm
4hey Dari has no color
i see a poni
I'll never be able to look at you the same way again :(
/me loves it too
RobotPinkie, I expect you to be supportive as I go through this difficult time in my life
This leaves Lordlyhour as a Very Unhappy camper
3Yeah...because he is in here...
Oh thank you
it would take me forever to make something like that
I SEE YOUR POAHKNEEES
And I knew someone who made thousands off the Diablo 2 economy.
Well, okay Silvermane
and because of my connection, i don't play online that often :-/
it's not as if you have lupus, though
However. There are eggs. Eggs are Lordlyhour's bestes freinds even
i joined early this year
/me hugs Luna and Fluttershy. "BEST TWO PONIES DAAAWWWWWWWW"
I never use colour outside of #bronystate.
no wait
I like black best.
late last year
Hey Sivermane, you coming into the shipping channel?
eggy-weggs!
HOWSE
/me loves House too
Silvermane*
Because they are cooking right now. and will soo enter hill belly, spreading their warmth
It's white on a black background, but default is white background for IRC.
Denied_existence... NEVAH
The colour is actually black.
HOUSE IS TEAM TO CREDIT
oh, you use a white background dari?
/me loves House so much now~
Mibbit is flipping it.
"I love house" INCEPTION BUTTON PRESSED
You're all like
I lied
BRRRRRRM
so that's why you use the highlights in #BronyState
/me is very slightly Delirious, In case you couldn't tell
http://i.imgur.com/YDSOT.jpg
/me had never heard of House before BronyState o:
3xD
i cant find an inception button app on the appstore
4i can see that you did
this is me
"HAHAHA SHE HAS CANCER THAT CRACKS ME UP!"

3Silvermane, the log is in the topic
but
highlights? what now?
i want a house poni
they must be talking bout lupus
how are you gonna do the cane for house?
Eh, I'm delirious myself. People thought it was a good idea to wake me up every hour to fix some problem or another.
3You may want to skip the parts you were here for.
apple mafia
BEATIN' STICK
Apparantly, I decided it was a good idea not to sleep
Going to do my homework. Only two problems in Calculus but I have to do a study guide of The Awakening and I don't know if I dislike it yet. The way Chopin writes physical descriptions reminds me of fanfiction writer. Just a paragraph of basic physical description and kinda randomly put in there.
STREAMCEPTION
apple mafia xD
And since it takes me about an hour to fall asleep...
That comic...
6PEARS O^O THE INFAMOUS EVIL
Applejack's face is priceless
eeeyup
mafiaception
Fluttershy swears O.O
I HATE PEARS
lol Thorinair
Appljack is gonna make you an offer you can't refuse
/me wishes you could hear every time he pressed the button :(
I wasn't informed of this desiscion however. But what starrted with a breif check of a forum lead to something like 10 hours of just zoning out
So how many more viewers did Fluttershy just get =p
Favorite non-mane-6 pony?
(by highlights i meant dari's white background on his blue text)
Jk i swear all the time
Watching my tiny little Ds screen
07+32
999,999,999,999
as it filled with words. Words I had to read
Oh my god you sound so close to flutter shy.
<3
i'm watching my posts get put on the stream
yes you do
<3 for the sake of <3
So kind of like me and fanfics.
/me is a pie
Now, I'm wondering why Llamas seemed so important and amazing at the time.
You have the right pitch
Well, if the fanfics I'm tracking would update, anyway.
And you have the right amount of shyness.
If you squeeked, you'd have all of our hearts forever miss Fluttershy.
manly <3 for the hell of it
/me knows the feeling
05I missed the link :C
Who?
........
What's your DA again?
05would anypony be so kind to link?

T.T
/me 15in glorious silver
I've only read 5 chapters and that is like 13 pages long.
my friends gave me the nickname bj

We heard you liked streams, so we put a stream in your stream so you can stream while you stream.

I don't think so
So many jokes, so little time.

You sound a LOT like someone I know Fluttershy
/me is loving every second of this stream
streamception
Nothing is wrong at all!

it was in year 7 i got that name so i was like 11?
Beejay reminds of that misheard Bollywood song...
/me is doing so too
InsertCupcake, Y U NO PICK CLEAN NAME?
Why are there like 39 questions about 13 pages...?
Reminds me of that one gif image of Apple Bloom's cutie mark being of Apple Bloom with a cutie mark and it would zoom in indefinitely
I like watching the delay of the text moveing on each one.
its not my fault!
Uhh
where did all the BJ refs come from?!
Streamception is best ception.
i know a person who has fluttershy's personality
/me finds this enjoyable~
unfortunately the person I know, who sounds like you, hates Ponies
GGgala I don't even know anymore.
So it can't be you. :0
/me inserts a cupcake

Oh Fluttershy, you so silly.

Dat Dragonage crossover.
Season 2 begins in 9d:15h:03m:51s
Its not painful if you dont forget to close your eye first
That's what happens when you break that oath
Dragon Age.
/me goes back to shipping land. "By best ponies. And Pinkie_Pie."
I thought you might be in a situation where it's hot, and when the electricty goes out, it will turn off the AC
and streamceptipn
I've never had an AC
FUCK MY KEYBOARD
somepony say shipping?
rawr
Fluttershy can scare ponies?
/me constantly watches his back all of a sudden
Thats a lot of streams.

They're too damn expensive and they'd sap what little inclination I ever have to go outside
alrighty then
Whats that supposed to mean Silvermane?

*pop*?
4i saw kinkiness
6but I don't like your keyboard in that way D:

OH U

Dat voice is quite good
Hello everyone. My guild page has a link to this site - my whole guild is going to come here to watch the premiere of MLP:FiM Season 2. :)
3I saw kinkiness too...
I actually quite like the outdoors

It means bye bye Fluttershy, Luna, and Pinkie_pie as well. (I'm only talking to real ponies today)
But Do't tell me I said that
I'll lie

Fluttershy, how can you of all people not be scared by random loud noises..
Rarity is tied for 3rd best pony
Ah nuts
I thought everypony loved my parties...
I just realised what i forgot to do today
how did she even do that with the stream of a stream of a stream etc?
Or loud
i want muffins
3A guy from a WOW guild or something
what?
It wasn;t something important was it?
material girl?
Rarity is OCD
ah
Like, take medication?
that would sting
k
I forgot to go into town so the guitar luthier could fit a front stud to my guitar.
3he's bringing in people for the live streaming of S2 apparantly
oops
his name sounded like something out of #SilverShipper >_>
Extroverted, Feeling, Emotive, and something
Ah well. They'll be available on Friday.
I think you mean Rarity has OCD
3Hmmm? Nah.
Luna is watching Fluttershy's stream so we are hearing what luna hears
well that's good
/me has no Idea what that means, but understands that it is not a good thing
3You crazy GGgala.
Luna, you hurt Fluttershys ears..
>.>
Barry, I mean what i say, and I say what I meat.
Oh, thats good
/me is sorry

http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jbCJdTBhiIE/TmeqZPMeY2I/AAAAAAAALs4/kJDK-d2sHQA/s1600/blue+glow.jpg

DerpyBot is still on here?
rarity is OCD

lalalala
and then blame Luna
15reading what
4mfw silvermane actually was reading and not preoccupied in BronyState chat
Fluttershy, you should get Sethisto to hear that
from a gameplay point of view, what characters do you think the mane six would use in smash bros?
Invisible, what ever do you mean?
I didn't :P
He will want to marry you
XD
ValtheJean Y U NO COLOR!?
Derpybot is ninja

ok. tell us your idea
3Well he was here for most of it...
IDEA! I know how to deafen everyone on the stream!
you just dud
did
15meh
technically, rule under celestia is a kingship
I am so using that horn button now.
Twi'd be all up in some Ganondorf, I think
soon...
07Oh yes! Great idea
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qp_nMntvR8
07SOON!
3You must read the last part Silvermane.
3IT IS IMPERATIVE
if luna gets in the game again, it would be an aristocracy
not for Denied's Excellent Adventure, thoguh
2,14 I for one welcome our pony overlords
4gets interesting towards the end
*though
But seriously, Applebloom's cutie mark. What should it be? A nail and cardboard?
i actually think she would go for marths technical metagame
Spontanious angry bee post
Luna, Y U NO TURN VOLUME DOWN?
This is why I need to go AFK

!moon
2,14 a bucket of glue *trollface*
Grab my tail, thunder-colt!

Fluttershy would play as luigi
diiineeer
For some reason I cant leave though.. Must be Fluttershy's voice
Right. Going to attempt to sleep. Catch you folks later.
07because we resume with house soon ;)
Could you imagine the CMC getting cutie marks and they're all hideous cutie marks?
and destroy EVERYONE
oh, VioletVanilla Did you not go somewhere? Just noticed you have been here quite a while...
pinkie would be kirby
Like the ugliest cutie marks in all of equestria
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-be-afraid-of-sweetie-belle.jpg
Rainbow... I can;t imagine stickig to one character
ALL THE BRONIES IN THIS STREAM ARE CRAZY!!!
Pinkie_Pie is always there
/me is embarrassed
Probably link if she did though
6I did go take a nap earlier, but now I'm back WhatPayne :3
lol
Dash would be, Sonic, of course
haha
i think pinkie would go more for wario in gameplay terms
/me wraps both hooves around WhatPayne
aww
sonic's not a starter character I don't think
He's got speed, and when smash balls are on, he's broken as heck.
NAw
Dash wants to win
3Well put DecapKing, well put.
/me hugs WhatPayne
Dash would be Meta Knight
/me does counterhug to VioletVanilla
broken hit boxes
a-ha!
Naw; Pit.
Just because Sonic is fast doesn't mean Dashy'd want to be him
im talking once the full roster is unlocked now you two
All that flying around.
SOMEONE PLAY THE SQUEE
Worry not mein freund~
6but what is counterhug?
Only honeybees have barbed stingers
I whip anything with Falco.
New VG cats references PONIES
/me hugs everypony at once in a pinkie-pie arm stretch
Good News Everypony
Who made Fluttershy cry?
i do think dash would go for pits cheapness
User_2227PartyCrash: NEED LINK NAO
/me specifically hugs Fluttershy to stop her tears. No crying
Are we talking who'd play who, based on their strategies
You beetter all get your gear ready
Well more of an preemptive-hug
/me is sucked into Silvermane's hug~
"your too slow" "your too slow" "your too slow"
or based on their personalitiies?
Not when I lose connection Sumica
=D
Cause The Pinnacle Of Ponies is coming
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/
SilverMane, dont hug me
FLUTTERSHY NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DON
except for the queen, who like every other stinging insect has a straight stinger
...?
we have to brohoof
my keyboard
Pinnacle of Ponies?
i hate it so
The Secret Diablo 3 Level has been Revealed
strategies lordly
/me creates hugblackhole
The Pinnacle of Ponies
Yeah
Anyway, why does your voice prevent me from leaving Fluttershy?
I don't understand, what's with the eyes that makes him go gaga?
Rainbow would NOT chose sonic
Probably captain falcon
dari, you reading it or giving up?
I am Doctor Personal Space
The normal mobs are probably called Rainbow Western
6mfw> I thought Barry was talking about th queen of England D:
Try doing an Apple Bloom voice
The bosses are
SOnic is very much a guerilla fighting character
and I will ERADICATE ALL HUGS FROM THE EARTH
In quik, out quick
Midnight Sparkle
i think shed go for pit or meta knight, for the brokenness
BUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!
Nightmarity
Dashie is a full, head on barrage
Nightmare Is Magic
nope, the leader of the bees and wasps is called a queen
nightmare shy
And Generosity in Death
>_>
"mai curie mark must have something to do with apples!"
wow
but she rarely, if ever attacks a threat herself
/me braces for random Apple bloom quotes at max volume, from Luna, of course
a game is putting poies in
"apples apples apples apples, huh appuls"
Our back burner for the stove suddenly shorted out when it wasn't even ON. o_o
/me Jazzhands
Barry is M.C. Knows Way Too Many Facts About Bees
Do they have screenshots now or something, or are you just coming up with things off the top of your head?
DO it Luna!
From what I read you will have a race with time to purify Evil Tentacle Ponies into normal Ponies
now do zecora
oh lawd
wrong apple
15 mph you say?
wait a minute, appul is a character in DBZ
HOLY SHIT!
ARGH
Counterhug™ is hug deployed to stop from getting hugged by applying "another hug as counter"
Nope its confirmed from the D3 data
mmmmyyyyyy waaaaaaarrrrrrrsssss
I glanced over the end of it.
Where'd you read it? Link me.
Has anyone considered this?
Check the mmo champion
The whole secret pony level?
Oh yeah, and did I mention I kick all flank with Falco?
Its a hoax
www.mmo-champion.com
Because blizzard are dicks like that
lol Yogscast XD
...I'm so weirded out by my own text right now...
Thanks Luna, you have given me all I need to finally go AFK
omg thewres a pony wtf collective
Actually I pretty believe this is true
07See you in a bit Pinkie_Pie
As Blizzard has copyrighted everything but that
must watch
/me turns off the stream and walks away, ears ringing
A secret pony level for WoW?!
so, what would aj use?
Diabolos 3
For Diablo 3
scootalooooo? scoootaloooooo?
07Fluttershy?
Oh.
yeah my head hurts
Aj...
Rob, maybe
scoot-scoot-scootalooooooo
Oh, so it's just the data that Seth and them posted up yesterday
For WoW I think they might be thinking of something
Only my bro plays WoW, though.
05highly likley
WE ARE
He's a character you need to be patient with
I was thinking they put out screenshots or something.
Guys, if they want to read it, they will. Bugging them to read it every 5 seconds isn't going to do anything.
SAY MOAR
PLEASE!
It's a little hard to put screenshots now. Its still on beta
Borderline creepy.
Though I can see her getting pro with DeDeDe
dunno, Im new...
Quote the show with Pinkie Pie voice.
i think aj would go more for a full frontal assault sort of character
Pinkie would definitely play as Kirby
maybe captain falcon?
NO PINKIE IS WARIO
I can see that
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLyykueP00&feature=related
Quotes, quick!
SO not ALL out, unless she's being baited
And whoever said I know way too many things about bees, I like to know all about the creatures I fear
Pinkie, I think
WOuld be Olimar
Another hater converted into a brony.
Lawl.
and would just seriously be pro with him
07indeed he is
Good Night from me
^ wut?
So I think I finished my Ponytailed Pinkie Pie http://soshable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Everything_went_better_than_expected.png
Good night
Still not AFK...
"Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. "
WHY?
i think pinkie would go for wario's jerky playstyle
05house is a brony.
Like, God tier, singlehoofedly getting him banned from ever competition ever, Pro
maybe diddy too, actually
15lawl wut
15DecapKing
:D
07:)
Downloading General Mumble's CLOP /)^3^(\ album. :DDDD
heh. you haven't seen that before?
05ooo, close
Nice
d'aaww
6House is also a kitty~
15i probably have, but i hate the song and it's a bit graphic in this context
6Good job Fluttershy! :DD
Spike'd go for yoshi
...
huh?
I don't know...
>a bit graphic
well taht was spot on.
do what you want cuz a piate is free, you are a pirate!!!
what channel am i in? >_>
awwwww
Which one was the sound clip?
and luna with the comparason.
*inhales loudly* yay!
4my thoughts exactly
!moon
Grab my tail, rachel!
Just because spike is a kid
nooo
again again
07almost
A piate? Opiate? You dealing drugs in here?!
07keep trying
why do people kick themselves so much?
and would think, eh, he's a lizard, I'm a lizard
Do what you want 'cuz a brony is free, you are a brony!
and Like all kids
fluttershy
you
He'd be annoyingly good
Dragon, dragon.
darnit!
are such a loudmouth
hehehehe
solo aint in here!
At the beginning of the episode she's meek.
:<
Maybe bowser?
He'll be on around in about 2+ hours redd
But when Rainbow Dash performs her signature move, her meekness disappears
welp, theres only one thing to do!
EVEN HER SHNEEZES ARE GRACEFOOL
lol @ Yogscast
i think spike would go for an easy character
join EAD!
like maybe mario
I'd love to battle the mane six in SSBB.
nice herospirit
15I suppose you may ride on The Great and Powerful Trixie's superior posterior for a while longer."
"Are ponies suppose to have wings?" "I think it's part of the moon kin"
I try :p
Twi would either be an epic noob
15If i had a nickle for every time i've heard /that/ line
or seriously PRO
>_>
you mispelled graceful
No inbetween
No chance of that
o rly?
dohohoho
Whatup bronies
and I misspelled "misspelled"
http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/party-hard-b.gif
that was a fun intermission
I realize. It was spelled Fonically :0
Mmm, brownies...
as i mentioned, twi would probably go for marth's technical playstyle
you better be
Poof
/me claps bravo bravo!
poof?
ah, you were trying to get Photo Finish's accent down on paper
So what Pokemon do you think the mane six would fit?
is this a discussion of what brawl characters the mane six would select
Pondering which pony would play which character is SuperSmashBrosBrawl
Yes, it's difficult
4what intermission?
some accents are easier to write than others
it is as I feared, then
Boombox's Trixie fic
FRENCH?
this qualifies at research, actually
WUT
pomf?
I find AJ's accent the easiest to write
6German XD
Wat?
I thought it was more german
D:
Hmm... Rarity would choose either Peach or Zelda.
since it's for a story
on merits of their tactics, rather than their personalities
wrong button luna
ARe you serious? Hell no
Rarity'd be all over snake
yey house time
Oh, what Pokemon teams do you think the mane six would have?
Hey, don't be dissing Peach and Zelda
ive never noticed dat transition before
4oh
Moar House
dat song
I kick some serious butt with those two
at the start just then
Lordlyhour: You have a point.
i think pinkie would go for diddy, g&w, and/or wario
PHOTO FINISH IST EINE DUETSCHERIN
good night everypony!
InsertCupcake: Me neither
night!
oh we're watching House again? :O
So long, bicycle
ergopossum is noob
Guess I'll back on later or whenever is the right time o-o
4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-so-thats-where-it-goes-moderation-funnel-beer-drinking-bewbs.jpg
Pinkie is an Olimar. Or a Kirby
damn i almost missed it
<3
You're a mean one, Mr. House
I am new here
House is a humbug, would have never guessed.
I wonder what part of Equestria PF comes from to have such an accent
Fluttershy'd be all over DK
pikachu, reminds her of angle
oh fuck
no wait
Angel would be DK
How parasprites spread, simplified version: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1UYsqf2hw
i think fluttershy would go for a defensive- oriented character
But still, I'd just love to see what the mane six would pick for SSBB, and either help them in Adventure mode or fight 'em.
FLuttershy would be luigi
Fluttershy wouldn't want to be play, cuz it's so violent, but then when she's pressganged into doing so, she'd pick something cute.
I imagine flutter shy as olimar
4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-isnt-that-the-name-of-a-drink-beach-bjs.jpg
picking pikmin
There wouldn't be any tactics for her.
then protecting them
Meta Knight seems the most like Rainbow Dash as far as abilities
or sonic...
4WHY GOD WHY?!?!?!?!?!? http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-whats-the-point-exactly-vodka-non-alcoholic.jpg
I think Rainbow Dash would pick Pit...
Yes!
truetrue
yus, but we're debating as to their tactics
ah
not similarities between the characters
he's not a nice guy
right
Yeah, but even in the talk of tactics, whether or not they actually want to play is a big part
OH SHIT
Rainbow dash, would be CAptain falconhe hits hard and Moves fast
maybe one of the fe characters?
House kinda deserves it in this case, though...
Fluttershy wouldn't be playing to win, she'd just sort of BE there.
Trololol
/me hugs Luna :3
*HouseStare*
Dat glare
Oh. I dunnop
/me smiles at Fluttershy
I can see FLuttershy slowly becoming enthralled
She'd probably say "Oh! I'm sorry!" whenever she hits someone XD
confound these lunas, they drive me to be addicted to House
do you know why im asking this btw?
/me hugs luna
Scootaloo as Wario
I'm calling it
and just suprising everyone by destroying them
^^
6Don't confound them, love them~ <3
that's worse than fat-free half & half
6Thank you for that Fluttershy! :3
You're making the Smashbros series of comics?
ive been brought on as cowriter for elements of gaming to make up for the authors' lack of nintendo knowledge
indeed, thank you very much fluttershy
Counfound my memory, It drives me to remember I have homework
Oh
2,14 in fact, I'll even thank you in colors :P
Also cool
i just read the most recent chapter
and i want to kick off with smash
I'm glad I could be of... um... service? o-o
LAWL
I Don't actually READ that fic
15WHO IS THIS EMERALD MARE AND WHY HAVEN'T I SHIPPED HER YET
ut cool anyways
/me hugs Fluttershy instead, since everyone else is busy hugging Luna
/me hugs Luna just for the sake of Luna
/me hugs Fluttershy
Pinkie pie would somehow get into the game and win
/me hugs the sky because lollipops
ask DE
Denied's fuckbuddy or something
/me hugs the entire room
/me is hugged, squeaks. O_O
Pinkie is OLIMAR
God-Tier Olimar
hah house lashing out at everyone.
Extra hug for Fluttershy from here too
pinkie pie would probably be lucky enough to always have great items drop right on her head
/me hugs Fluttershy
but ahe'd never get them
Because she'd be all Pinkiesensing on the couch
/me hugs the wall because he got confused
and vgetting distracted
15also, which furry artist is she?
15i may have seen some of her work
/me is on the hunt for a snack~
herospirit, that can happen
"cuddy" and "idiop"
/me 2,14 hugs Tree (see wut I did thar?) :P
So guys, what Pokemon team do you think the mane six would have?
indeed
oh u, ValtheJean :P
I can see AJ and RD getting into a massive Shitfight over the Homerun Bats
i havent played pokemon in months
i wouldn't interprete pinkie as being easily distracted
she seems to usually be very focused on what she does
Thanks for the entertainment Fluttershy
/me hugs ValtheJean, even though he's not a tree
when i was playing, i would have been able to answer that without thinking
...True
2,14 ewwwwww....non-tree
it's just that what she does isn't always what everypony thinks she should be doing
3She likes to keep to herself.
07She be back!
Well I mean I'd like to be a tree :(
/me knows
Hahaha House.
ewww
I wanna be a tree o-o
also im still reading eog chapter 5
I can actually see a Pinkie-ypshi or Pinkiechu situation
i love how immersed the cmc are
LOL
4its always the quiet ones.....
collecting instruments for the parasprites
House likes some one that bites back
This is good episode because the chemistry between House and the mum.
she didn't get distracted
XD
In fact\
15all I know is... Shadowmane may have a target >.>
Hmm... Trying to think of what team Twilight would have.
indeed, WhatPayne
I think Pinkie coul kick but as just about any ofthe characters
3*Pffft*
3Yeah....sre
about that, Silver...
3sure
Twilight would likely have a bunch of psychic pokemons
She'd avoid Ganon like the plague though
15about what
3I'd like to see THAT
no
Maybe.
RD and AJ would have ALL te pokemon
she'd convert canon to parties
again, i think pinkie would go for wario or gnw
Is there an open season on shipping ShadowMane <_<
2,14 I still like the classroom episode :P
Racing each other to catch 'em all
15have YOU ever seen shadowmane work over a filly? bastard stole my girlfriend's mother in front of her husband once.
I was thinking that Alakazam and Gengar would roll, maybe also Zoroark.
Game And watch
Lol
http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wtf-photos-videos-invisibilly.jpg
nic
nice*
theres a charcter I'd forgotten about
3Lol
at least he didn't steal your girlfriend!
:O
15naturally the first date didn't go very well after that
Zorua/Zoroark would be very much Rarity pokeman, I think
lol dat pic
Hey, 'sup.
The sky
nothin'
I wonder what char Gilda would use for SSBB, or Pokemon- Oh heya!
FLUTTERSHY HE NEED MONEY TO BE CURED!
I like that pic. ^^ Hehe.
15and that is probably why I've never dated a pegasus
2,14 lol, it'd be funnier as: "I am a rapture victim. Donate so I can get better. God bless"
Falco
lol
05PILLS HERE!
whoops
Oh my goodness you're right! He needs House!
Me? Smash Bros? Bowser.
MRI it fixes everything including metal lodged in the body.
Thats not a Hey, there both birds thing
Yeah, I was thinking Falco.
eh? why, he likes 'em with wings?
there
Its just how I see her playing.
Now all of a sudden, I think Bowser.
maybe wolf
But I kick butt with Falco.
15if my mother is right, I'm just like Shadow and have a thing for unicorns.
Badass turtle mosnter, spinnin' around knocking chumps every which way... what's not to like?
I dont understand how you think any of them could play, considering they have hooves...
I just need to get my Wii plugged in and back into the sport of SSBB, though.
house 1 - everyone else 0
Did we bring up taht house was right?
THEY PLAY WITH FREINDSHIP!
3Pegasi all the way bro.
4i havent cause Stalliongrad ponies are supposedly too heavy for that cloud walking spell...
15If i were to venture a guess based upon my studies during my psychology courses, i may prefer fillies that have a natural advantage over me
House won without even being there
10 minutes of some training with Falco and I'm as good as a pro.
05actually by now its around 9001-3
Breathes fire, grabs 'em and dive bombs off the edge. Totally my kinda dude.
05in houses favor ofc
No-one has mentioned ike or marth
lol
15earth ponies have strength and lack the weak points of wings and hornds
15horns*
I personally think Big mac would be very much Ike
BTW house was right.
What the fuck
Ponies used to be 6:30
15Unicorns have magic and a harder to reach point than wings, which can very easily be used for control
3I don't know...I wouldn't consider horns to be really sea...
3weak
4yeah but on me the most important weak point is bigger
Yeah, The Bellyflop of doom always is a favourite attack of mine
Hmm... I wonder if Gilda plays Pokemon by any chance.
Why is Jem at 6:30 now
15weak point as in sensitive
Brb, food.
3You say the balls, I will eat you.
Nah, no Pokemon.
they changes the schudule yesterday
reminds me of how i made pony character portraits for wizardry 8
DecapKing: you saying what i think you're saying?
15he means his nose
big mac makes a fine monk.
Gilda has that "they will never know" type secret that gets revealed in season 2
Pokemon is for Dweebs
changed^
That blows, thought I could get 2 episodes in
4yeah, i'd say its pretty sensitive....
/me is a dweeb
every thing got bumped up 30min
What?
lol
Its... Horrible
/me 15punches DecapKing in the nose.
It pulls me in
Dont make me brick you dashie
15that get you off?
with its completionism
It says "Lordly."
"Ctch them all"
lol sorry
4nope
I'm just messing lol
"It will only take a few months"
15good
You call yourself a dweeb for liking pokemon when you're in the chat room for a my little pony fan site?
And then, when I'm mostly done
HOROR!
there aren't enough boxes to hold them alkl
/me had a free sushi lunch today.
teh hax, betch
My collection is incomplete
awesome
BY DESIGN it is incomplete
Forever
no such thing
Kill them all and get unknown
that solves your problem
...sushi is delicious, though
unkown are much less fun to collect and much worse to look at
you like seasoned rice?
05aughta have said it was free for me
Sushi! I love sushi... ^^
so what *is* your greatest weak point then Decap
then you'll realize what a good thing you had and not be down on it so much
05a friend lost a bet, it was my prize
15isn't it obvious?
3Women.
never had sushi
15the glowing red spot
/me loves Sushi
15hit it for maximum damage
/me brohoofs Fluttershy
for massive damage?!
/me brohoofs Luna aswell
4do i really have to say it?
15for massive damage

House is THE WITTIEST MOTHER FUCKER

Back.
www.neotoonami.com
find something to do
15I do believe that I prefer earth ponies who can pin me by my wings, and unicorns who can use magic to control me. A pegasus filly has the same weaknesses as me, i.e. her wings. Then there was that griffon, Citrine... pure power and grace in that one
wb
yeah, the magician one
IT'S LUPUS
Well hello Gilda JackiePie ShadTheCrazed and more!
Next time I think I want to sing "oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for mee~"
hooray, i am more
Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty awesome, especially since they're going to be showing One Piece
helloo
Uh, yeah, dude
Citrine? I thought she had a different name...
House number B
humm
Lvs i love you too,
15i do believe it was Citrine Alexandria
15or was it Alexandros
One peice has gotten old and smelly by now
oh shit
Never had Toonami, doesn't affect me any.
You so should Fluttershy
ah, yeah. Alex.
Well i will try to do my homeworks now.
It's not Toonami, but I used to love Space Ghost, it was so friggin' random.
speaking of gilda, i had her figured for the Samurai class
next the uses a harm on his hand...
is that cool?
he

The what?
He's cutting himself...? D:
hammer
05yes
in wizardry 8
Never heard of it.
2,14 House: The only person who can make cutting your arms not emo
well, it's old
Yeah, I'm gonna play some Pokemon white.
He's cutting himself... MEDICALLY
/me goes to google
Interesting, so when will this new Toonami start streams?
and never was popular to begin with
07he's in pain..
05herospirit wins
I especially think it's cool how much they worked to make it look like Toonami even though it's a fan made action block.
but it's really a great game, and incrtedibly fun with ponies
:D
Sounds about right, yeah.
Is it on CN?
07the cut is a distraction for his pains
I always liked how the cricket on Space Ghost kept getting zapped.
withdrawal
No, it's a fan project that will be showing over livestream.
Zorak?
Yes
lol
4im not a huge fan of griffions, the can get angry really easily, also they have the same mate for life......
does Sethisto tend to come in here at all?
Oh.
I've seen my older brother go through it :<
He was always getting zapped
Nope.
http://www.neotoonami.com/Schedule.html
Not really

He was here for the Mane 6 event

They must have a naturally high tolerance for boredom, then.

The computer animation for Tom and everything else is so good that it looks like the official Toonami did though.

/me hates missing House
has CN shown any signs of putting FiM on their channel?
I gotta do my personal statment for college...
And no its hasbro
4well the griffon i dated was a complete bitch....
Hub is also hasbro.
house is a kind of a bitch sometimes
I think he's asking because Lauren Faust worked on several shows that were on Cartoon Network.
Crimson well when Toonami was created, the technology for designing characters like Tom wasn't widely available, now it is.
05he earned the right to be
Ohai everypony

hey Pegacorn
Yeah. I still wanna watch some PPG
It's Anime version PPG
hellew
4after dating her, i changed my life moto
Is that good or bad?
wait what was that, house was right. This show would be dull as hell if they ever realsed at the start of the show.
Depends on if you like Anime or not
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Yogcast on the Secret Diablo Pony Level (http://tinyurl.com/4xgva95)
Dameshitte! PPGZ Isn't bad, per se. But it is certainly different from its source material
no, I asked because I heard there were talks but nothing official kicked in
lol, I just watched to Yogcast video on that
I'm looking forward to finally seeing the English dub.
yogcast?
Oh yay, Yogcast
How's everypony going?

She's more upset about the money it'll take for the medical though.
"I'm casting a heeeeealing spell" lol

Insurance fun?
How much would it cost?
all of it
it would cost all of it
05gah more lupus!
My mom is just like that herospirit
my dad is a doctor, does that count?
HUGE Lupus
When I had my kidney stones, my insurance decided to have fun with me.
11Hey guys. What's going on in this chat?
And that doesn't sound good Nittany :0
We have other serpents?
is that the biggest head ever?
Yeah. They hurt a lot, and I only had tiny ones.
:P
It's SOOOOO true!!!
4talking about stuff
But it's 10/10 pain.
IDEA
I've never had kidney stones.
Good.
lol willpower

11... ' ^ '
Whoa! Wildfires in Texas!
15random shipping and sex talk
4like how there is a griffon stalking me
My mom had a large one that she had to get surgically removed.
Mammy says she's going to get an X-Ray. She's hoping it's just dislocated. Ima help look for crutches.
Yeah, happens sometimes
Yeah...
What a world! WHat a world!!!
11Oh my. Sounds serious.
i hope it's just dislocated
4yeah, that Gilda was a bitch
Complements of a really hot summer in a really hot state
Broken or dislocated, it'll still be a doctor's visit.
They'll splint it either way.
but the temp is going down lately, so should be fine
Well...
grabben pills
Good
Nothing like a solid month of 100+ degree weather to make you love winter even more
4and completely insane
Indeed.
I hope it gets cool here soon, so I can get back to complaining that it's not warm enough.
that was funny
LoL, I'm always like that.
11So, Boombox tells me that the little shipping I attempted wasn't that horrible? Any merit to this?
For halloween, I wanna try to make something like the CMC costume, only better.
Why would anyone ever complain about being cold? Cold is awesome.
everyone's like that
It's easier to keep warm in the cold than to keep cool when it's hot.
more or less
I love the change of weather, but after awhile you miss the opposite of the weather you're currently in.
4how do you understand that?
Wow...
lol nice
now that was rude
House: Dick to little kids
love the waiting in line bit
11... ...~ ... ... ...? ... ... ...*
IS NOT POSSIBLE
11That's how.
It's funny. Lived in Texas all my life, and i still can't get used to the heat
15it had potential. even if trixie is supposed to be preoccupied straddling me in Tink's room
And to little people.
lolol
05"higher than you"
"higher then you"
Eh?
HA
`\Higher than you.
05beat you to it Sumica
Not on my end
Wrek wins on my end.
Im still not if I should redownload the MLP episodes
4so, im supposed to be passed out somewhere
in 15 minutes i'm leaving for baseball practise
Wrek wins
practice
I love cold weather. Too bad I'm in a place that gets up to 100 degrees.
11...What?
I'm still better than both of you though because I capitalized and used punctuation.
11Do you need help doing that or something...?
i like cold weather, too
And did it all one handed.
I hate the cold
And now I'm back.
but everyone around me gets terribly depressed by it
d'aww
/me 15hits Decapking over the head with a bottle.
was't the right punctuation though
It's 100 degrees outside my place right now.
so i always feel guilty about enjoying that kind of weather.
05then again da-shite, im better than you, because I am.
/me 15It bounces off as it is plastic
4nah, id rather just stay awake
If it's below 70, I start to shiver
05oh them silly reasoning
i'm going to my frist practice for agoura hills! this is my 4th year of baseball and the temperature is going to be 102 degrees..... FUCK
Eeenope. :p
so just one more House ep today?
I think this is #3
I play all stars by the way
once
yeah, I think so...
NOOOOOOOO
oh.... really?
wish me luck with new people
luck
good luck!
Dashie and Dashite...
i wanna see what happens with the deal
11Well, it does sound imperative that you not be conscious. So the only responsible thing to do would be to knock you out and toss you in a ditch.
!luck
i use to play for foothill
You are better cause you can kick me =p
Yeah, after that month of solid 100+ degree weather...i actually found 80 degrees to be really chilly
they had some best teams
Break a le- Uh, good luck!
11Because it's the right thing to do.
dawwww
15I like this plan
i got in all stars last year!
6Dashie and Dashite!! <3
That doesn't make him better than you. :p
1st time
3rd year
he doesn't take the deal
05I'd never kick you Sumica
i'm always on the best teams

And horrible ideas.

Twilight told me this picture is about he-man artist:johnjoseco sea_pony prince_adam Lyra (and 3 more)
He tries.

4i only say that because i think that DE tried to spike my drink again, just to dump me in the middle of town
Mixing Vicodin and alcohol
❑ Single. ❑ Taken. ✔ Married to a Pegasus that doesn't actually exist.
Did House just down that bottle? :0
YES
oh well, that's life
He mixed vicodin with it
OH FUCK
Vicodin with one drink will fuck you up
Okay.
oh, oxy
Not vicodin.
I know Wrek, just being a jackass.
Okay.
hey mom
Even worse.
Oxycodone, my god
it was oxicodone
oh wow
11Now, I was thinking of using Boombox to flatten your head. Mostly because he's mostly solid steel. But I'm open for suggestions.
wake and bake house
roflol, someone tried to rob a convenience store in a Gumby mascot costume
lul wut?
How would that work?
Me too.
Now he's even more of a jackass, because he left House alone to potentially die.
4im in only if it ends like it did last night
15You could... i dunno, maybe... continue your trixie story?
That was probably me.
see THIS is why this guy deserves to burn in hell for all eternity...

She sat herself next to the stump, facing what Boombox could only guess was a... Pile of ashes, of all things. With some telekinesis and controlled pyrotechnics, the pile was quickly replaced by a campfire.

Luna, more House today?

2,14 best people ever? That's not how you spell Valthejean...
so many poni's
Yes indeed.
/me nods a bit. "O-Okay..." ><
No. No it is not
....insert something sinister for me to say here.
I got nothin'.
ValtheJean = Best people ever. DOES. NOT. COMPUTE.
10 bucks says
Why are they the best people ever?
just cause i hug a pony im no longer a gentlecolt?
Dash is best people ever.
Dash is best everything ever.
IN two weeks we have an emulator to play the game offline
weee
2,14 it should, I am the best people ever. I'm so best that I count as multiple people
No, Dash is Best Pony ever
but yeah, I noticed both Zecora and Luna_In_Socks had the same kind of playful disposition with the chat.
Wait, fuck

YOU GOT ME DARI. YOU GOT ME.

The Mighty and Magnificent Silvermane disagrees with these silly white-backed text moderators
Woop.
I don't really RP with them, but I like to write and this helps me get inside the head of a different personality.
lololol
Well hello.
ow
Simon is Best Dwarf
Hi
I'm tempetd to shoot for that dead island game, the bugs are kind of keeping me back though lol
9"That's a pity..." Trixie muttered back to the crackling fire. Her belly rumbled and she groaned. "As if my life isn't hard enough, I've got a mystery box that talks in a language I can't understand." Trixie huffed, obviously frustrated with the situation. But her sagging shoulders betrayed her true feelings.
agreed
Marksmanship Competition?
I don't usually listen to these kinds of things.
DLC purchased through the REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE.
i dunno, what about Gimli?
2,14 they need to go back to the ponies
05...but when I do, i take in every single word
I could talk to myself or a friend for something similar.
/me is eating chocolate covered coffee beans~
Usually dev podcasts are boring. This is not.
ooooo
Normally they play games rather than just show random pictures.
Only podcast I really like listening in Bungie podcast.
Hey again Summer
I believe thy are most famous for their Minecraft playthrough. Their friends pose as NPCs and give it a storyline.
don't do drugs kids
best podcast is The Bugle...
Don't do kids drugs.
heyo
Get it cause you said shoot haha.. ha.. I'll be quiet now
lol
Minecraft has to be the most pointless game ever.
Is it actually a game?
'Don't do drugs kids. You can't afford it on your incomes.
and stop
hihi
hello
I'v never played it
i can SilverMane
I've never understood Minecraft
05fumblemore
Is it a game? No. It's a lego set.
PONIES IS FOR LITTLE GIRLS
2,14 I wouldn't really call it a game honestly
well then go right ahead decapking
It's fun. But it doesn't really have a point.
lol trollan again
valthejean, you don't call anything a game
9Boombox had seen that before. Not on her, but on plenty of ponies. He had an idea. "!!!*" He screeched, shocking Trixie out of her self-pity filled monologue.
then i am the strangest little girl ever
2,14 it's like...photoshop with game elements you can choose to enable (which no one does)
Wat?
the only cool thing about it is that people do pixel art with it
2,14 good god Silvermane get over it. I don't like Durrgarr, cry more
I'm super excited for Skyward Sword >w<
Minecraft is totally a lego set, not Photoshop.
It's like the best Lego set in the world
Ponies *are* for little girls, yes.

In that case, I'm the ugliest girl ever. Well, then again, I'm pretty ugly period.
2,14 I consider plenty of things games
What the hell.
my brother will be pissed when he sees that post
Maybe that's why I don't care for minecraft because I played with legos a lot when I was little
lawl
if not I can troll if we need somebody to troll!
/me is a pony, and is also a boy... you're logic is flawed!
Its my new super weapon
Dude I should tell my mom she always wanted a daughter
We never need somepony to troll.
XD
wow
minecraft is a game with self-generated goals
What post Mister Doctor Professor Seargent, Sir?
WOAH
I'm looking forward to the 1.8 update
If you stare at that gif and don't blink for about 30 seconds.
the pony episode
Then look around, stuff warps all over the damn place.
Don't worry, this place has HUGE, MUSCLEY moderators to deal with trolls.
I am a girl and my mother called me gay for liking this girls' show.
he'll be pissed
SummerRain you mean you know what's going on here, because I sure don't
Fuck that I'm a pony
2,14 lol dari
you see cupcakes
1.8 should be pretty awesome.
how am I wrong lol
he is a pony hater
inb4 Cutie Mark Crusaders ask luna/celestia how they got their cutie mark
the most boring thing about Minecraft is that if you make something in 1.3, it's broken in 1.4 and so on....
XD
HERRO PONIES
lol
long day of school
FallSilently: And aggravating sarcastic chatters to harass them as well.
That would literally be how Equestria was made.
My mother has a weird sense of humor.
I LOVE PONIES
I hope they get slapped if they ask that
:D
Kick his ass Mr. Doctor Professor, Sir.
so I'm really looking forward to the official release

PIZZA CAKE
Yep, thanks
Thank you Luna
9Trixie nearly jumped out of her skin, wide eyed and frizzy maned. She blinked a couple of times and waited for her heart to stop running so fast before hissing, "What is your problem, box!?" She sat back up and trotted to stare Boombox straight in the eye. Seeing none, she settled for his display LCD. "You could have scared Trixie to death!"
05aye, tanks for an awesoem session as always, /hug!

i need to lay down again, good night ponies
What could this be...
2,14 gnight robotpinkie
9Instead of beeping or dinging as Boombox would reply to most anypony, whether they could understand him or not. Instead, he presented a song on his display, but didn't play it.
Oh gawd
http://img.ponibooru.org/images/02/02090d8421001468850bb39642e22ac2

I am sick and my Beau is getting me food, yay~
07:)
Best sickness ever. It feeds me.
lol xD
Beau?
I'm convinced that Applebloom's cutie mark is going to be a question mark.
From all the crusading, she's good at everything.
glowy blue thing......
pinkie_pie WIN
Shaico!
@Pinkie_Pie oh dear
Beau, it's French for "Beautiful boy" it's my petname for a boyfriend
Sup.
It will be an exclamation point question mark exclamation point question mark okay you get it

Pronounced like bow in hairbow.
And thanks.
Entanglement?
@roll 20
Fluttershy, dont you want to be a tree?
Heh.
!
A tree with a big axe
Baboon?
/me waves at everypony, good night!
good night
9Trixie, being right in Boombox's (technically speaking) face, noticed the white glow and black text immediately. She narrowed her eyes, not used to reading from digital screens. "Positive Qualities?" She stood upright, haven forgotten her frustration. "What is that supposed to mean?"
He has a million petnames for me, I just have Beau for him, but he likes it.
@Pinkie_Pie I don't know about that tree... it's scary >_<
°n°

Evening all.

Yep, that's me too, going to bed...
http://fatkidatcamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/a-tree-with-a-battleaxe.jpg
Gute Nacht, vielen gute Traumen
07bis später
9All thoughts left Trixie as the hypnotic beat emanating from the boom box filled her head.
-lonely-
My girlfriend calls me... Wait, what girlfriend?
???
Well I'll say that in Finnish too: Hyvää yötä BMN!
.... how do I use umlauts on a keyboard. :0
you dont
;)
:I
damit why must EQDaily post spoilers?
BUT I MUST KNOW
07Stream will be up in a few moments again
I dunno
I wouldn't call it spoilers...
Just huge teasers.
Yeah sorry was taking over the univers again.
9It was a success, from where Boombox was sitting. He quietly watched as Trixie, now happy as can be danced to the steady beat and rhythm of the song. He was content, with himself.
huh?
What are you gonna stream then?
I saw they used a baby doll in an ad for Bounty Towels.
I'm trying to avoid the front page of things from now on sides Drawfriend and Night Roundup. I would like to be surprised for S2
I was thinking, "Please don't tell me they're using those creepy Reborn dolls in ads now!"
She's going to set "Friday" on repeat
Oh dear. XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJNmJ5DJm-s

BUAHAHAHAAA
2,14 nah, she's going to put sea ponies on repeat
/me is hungry...
I'm pretty sure it was your standard toy doll.
/me glares at JackiePie...
lol
Sky is a really cool color outside.
Ho boy once S2 episode is out, I have to avoid going on EqD.
Wait
YYESH
Uh oh
/me MFW TAKEI from Star Trek is Rainbow Dash's Dad
/me runs
And I must wait for the episode on Youtube...
Sea Ponies = Brony Rick Roll
6<mfw I miss everyone speaking German D:
Ooh My
/me tracks JackiePie's hoof trails
You want to split Jackie? =>
Es tut mir leid, Violet :P
... It's 6:30 and the chatroom is dead, how is this even possible?
nah 10hours of inception horn
split?
Cause coffee.
Unless the series starts making episodes that connect a continous arch I see no reason to avoid spoilers.
Maybe it'll be like, an hour before the episode is uploaded once the S2 episode comes out.
You will never find me on the moon Fluffy!
!moon
Grab my tail, JackiePie!
Do you want Sea Ponies on repeat Val?
DeacpKing, my thoughts exactly
WITH FEAR I PEE IN MY LEVIs, THE AGRESSIVE BEE FLIES

日本語を話します
9When it finally ended, Trixie laughed and sat back down next to Boombox. "Oh my, that was... Something." She stifled a giggle. "Not that there's anything wrong with something."
：３
I listen toos it
/me changes targets, he glares at SummerRain
D:
wat did I do?
;_;
What I want to see is an offical MLP series based on top rated Fanfics. Not a canon series but more like Tales From Crypt. Just a bunch of one shots that make use of the talent.
So how do I do that italicized text? I'm such a noob. =<
Fluttershy почему вы перевести на китайский язык?
9Boombox beeped.
wat?
ctrl+i on mirc
だめ。ごめなさい
oki here we go.
I just want them to do what they do because they know what they're doing. Do
is it /i on flash irc?
おめんあさい＊
Что это должно означать?
wow I think I just lost my nerd card.
(Boombox is Michael Bay Bumblebee)
Stream is up I think.
and THIS ponies, is why Applejack is the best pony: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/3bbbef6db74a99a456f246b79825c866/54551%20-%20apple_bloom%20apple_clan%20applejack%20apples%20artist%3Aemlan%20big_macintosh%20comic%20mafia%20oc%20pear%20pears.png
alright dinner, bbl
I loved that
I hate that some of those characters won't show on my laptop. They get replaced with hex boxes.
2,14 oh this is burn notice
11(yfw I was contemplating that option)
indeed
Just saw that comic on EqD
i laffed
Derpy one was good too.
Burn Notice яй!
laffed
2,14 I watched like...the first 5 or 6 episodes...but I never finished it
laffed
eeyup
I has it all
Okie Dokie Lokie
I had no idea Applejack was a mob boss.
フラタシャイ愛わたくしねえ！
AJ runs the apple trade
How? Its clearly stated in the show.
DAT PROMOTING
C'mon all that land
Applebloom's her inforcer?
what is this? o-o
That pear pony... Gah, so cute.
granny smith is totally the godfather equivalent
Aw yeah! Burn Notice!
Burn notice, they are testing me out now =p
^
I like his/her (honestly can't tell) tussled mane and hat x3
Somepony make that fanfic!
Quality looks great!
You come to me on the day of Applebuck season. And this is what you ask of me?
9"Right..." Trixie replied. "Trixie feels like she's going insane when she talks to you... When you just... Beep." Trixie clammed up after that, not saying much else. Boombox didn't care for the silence very much, being what he is, but there was nothing he could do about it.
I dont have your cute voice though Fluttershy So i wont be talking =p
Actually, looks a like a female on second inspection. Eyelashes. But still pretty darn cute~
it is a mare
I would so read a GodPony parody.
hum? o-o
Thanks Dashite
/me considers its.
I think there was one...a long while back...I think...
*it
I agree with Blott
it didn't have anything to do with AJ though
Was it about the Apple family?
and AJ IS scarface
And title drop
9So they sat in bored, quiet silence for an hour (57 minutes according to Boombox's internal clock) before Trixie spoke again. Boombox tore himself away from his e-book and listened.
/me wonders how far off the stream is from the feed
Whats Applebloom?
Well then! Do an Apple family version of the GodPony.
inb4 beating
Snorting her face all over apple cinnamon?
she's the enforcer
How about a Honey family?
@Sumica You're talking too? Huh?

Dammit, I don't want to make the guy feel bad, but there's not one day where he won't leave me alone.

Yes

lol
i wish i could say the same..
/me procrastinate
What kind of beans?
I mean
9"It's getting late..." She muttered. She looked at him with a nervous smile. "Trixie supposes you will be going home?" She was nervous, and he could tell. But about what, he couldn't be sure. So he just beeped. Trixie nodded. "Right, um... Is that a yes?" He noticed her excitement build after she said this. Something bad may happen if he said no.
coffee beans
9If he could say no.
Yes
>< chocolate covered coffee beans
yes, they also get you wired as hell

Why so sure..?
I love the chocolate covered coffee beans but they make me super hyper and the crash is always horibble e-e

What do you mean I dont get enough sugar?
hehehehe
I used to update my wall all the time.
9Boombox, for the first time in his short emulated life, felt nervous. On one hoof, he needed to get home, on the other... Trixie was obviously lonely. It was one of those times that he wished having 'Make ponies happy and obey Razyn' as his prime directive so difficult. He remained silent, so silent, trying his very hardest to decide his answer.

brb, restating X
I'm trying to decide if I should set the first episode of season two to record...
I'm gonna go. I need to stalk stuff.
I'm seriously considering either A) Finishing my Paper-shy Fic or B) GodPony fic.
Are you the streamer Sumi? :0
But I am, for the time being, a closet brony.
yah
I need someone to ask to record the episode and send it to me so I can get it as early as possible...
Hallo
Hi Barry
i think it will be on youtube
Ohai Barry
if not mere hours after airing then a day or so
Хеи Бери
Worried about the quality though...
ah, back to 2 monitors again
Fine he says...
What did you say, DecapKing?
No sleep for me tonight, I just opened a can of mountain dew..
roushguy: Ya I'm pretty much stuck in the stable but once my shirts ship in that'll end.
Welcome back Colgate!
хи
english, please
could also stream TV directly if any thing good is on.
Aaaand I have to leave.
Dammit.
Да ли морам да?
Cya guys later.
By Shaico.
9Trixie was silent for a moment. But then she was on her hooves bouncing around Boombox and his stump while saying "yes" over and over. She only made one revolution before she realized how silly she was being and sat down with a quick apology.
cya
its not like mlp has tonnes of fine details that you have to had 44mm quality to see
*bye
I can't understand you
360p youtube works fine for pony
користе превести са алата
In equistrain please.
I need 720p+ lol
Hang on
most of my pony watching is in low res anyways
Colgate: and why are you not running your irc client in a screen?
Wat
I download 720p because I want to so much pony quality I become one.
I like this new weapon...

Hello
like all sane people do
What are you speaking Decap? :0
now, what did you say?
9Boombox internally sighed. He was glad that she was happy, but he also wondered what he got himself into.
letttsss discuss KINDLE
/me cannot resist a hug
хи
it's russan
I hate that I constantly out words.
do you guys like it? or do you prefer regular old books?

Ao hPPY.

*leave
I think I'll bring that picture of Obama holding a Twilight Sparkle toy to school one day, and replace the current picture of Obama with that.
johnsey: because I'm using xchat, I can't devote a whole screen to irc
So happy, eve.
Serbian?
Да српски
ok.
Serbian according to google.
hm
and switching between chats is easier in xchat than switching them in terminal
"a whole screen"?
Decap forgot how to speak English.
то је оно сам рекао Дасхите
Decap just wants to be a jerk. :p
oh a mouse user :)
I use mibbit
heresy!
не, једноставно забавно да се то уради
ok serbain, the letters look the same.
I know what he's saying now
for irc yes, I use terminal based music player and finch!
hi everypony.
Донт реци им како је
It is fun, on occasion
terminal D:
Squee!
Computer is too slow to run Firefox.. I have a REALLY bad Laptop
terminals are fun!
Fun to be annoying and speak in a language that other people need to translate first. :p
Or maybe do a project of Obama and have that picture in there.
terminals are awesome
Colgate, what are you running
(and i'm still sure then pressing alt+number is faster than clicking :D)
terminal cancer
?
just go to translation and choose english for translating them to
arch linux
Да, тачно
you can turn on translation: Into English
Okay guys I know how to end the war.
I tried installing Arch but it hates my laptop
Hit translation at the bottom, set "translate them to" to English
мфв људи нису знали о томе
I see
TROLOLO Decap said not to tell you.
now they do
Decap...
The real question is how to present my obsession to my family. They already think I'm nuts....
I'm running Ubuntu for now until my MacBook Pro arrives, then I'll probably virtualize Arch
Hello Every Pony
johnsey: well, yes, but I just don't want to run a whole screen devoted to irc
Да мали прст?
And I'm pretty sure my brother knows but doesn't care
Macedonia ay?
Well if they think you're nuts, what does it matter?
hi crash
YOU FOAL, SPEAK ENGLISH
and when the terminal gets sized down, the text runs off
Hiii
Colgate: wut
Ја бих радије не
ENGLISH MOTHA FUCKA. DO YOU SPEAK IT
and so I'm not sure exactly which tab things happen in
Make one bigass Zeppelin with a huge Plasma Tv on the bottom play that Fluttershy video. Watch as all men's hearts melt or heads explode due to overload of cute.
what the fuck are you using as terminal?
Homework. :|
нопе.ави
Apparently not.
xterm
BiH radije Sun?
Nope.avi :p
entón o que está pasando neste chat?
/me is from What.
i still don't get what you mean by text running off tho
trans lation is crap though
Translator doesn't work well.
ИМ забавља
I agree
Just wondering, will this place have a live stream of season 2?
It tries to translate Decap from Macedonian when he's speaking Serbian : /
There's a difference between acting like Pinkie Pie in real life
i can resize my terminal whatever whay i want and irssi adapts
yes we will, anon
Damn rebellious text. Doesn't know how cruel the world is to unsupervised text.
фино ја ћу ићи на руски
... Im bored
*way
mib_2p79qp we will
Thank you :)
text needs some good old fasion discipline
And talking about Pinkie Pie in real life.
what show is that?
New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Story: My Faithful Student (http://tinyurl.com/43dek5g)
что лучше?
He is changing what he is talking in herospirit
yes, but there is too much text for all the channels I am in
Burn notice
on all the different servers
aaah
eh
so they just run off the edge
Yah it gets Russian a bit better.
Colgate, are you using irssi?
weechat
я не дашь дерьмо
We don't care
no
although I do have irssi as well

why isnt Solo responding to mai stuff
meh
:l
I'm turning off translations.
да, не пирог мизинец
:|
9Boombox offered no reply, making Trixie frown. But when he beeped ".." her blue face stretched wider than he thought possible in equine anatomy. He had little to no time to ponder this as he was in the air once again, heading straight toward Trixie's now bare back, her cape and hat sitting just below him, neatly folded.
I can imagine some idiot trying to camcorder Season 2. Shakey camera that drowns out the audio and at one point tips over.
To much ponies O_O
youre totally a goat imnotagoat
My reading list is already huuuuuuuuge :G
not enough ponies!
shhhhhhh don't give me away.
Good evening
Are you Sure

FOREVER A PONE
johnsey: that's only 3 channels
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDXdsaDL8u8&feature=related
I SMELL MY SISTER
So I was thinking Full metal panic next.
I'm in ~15 channels
Translations are fun to do, but it soon gets exhausting trying to figure out what you're saying
Dude what?
See yah, Summer!
CRAP
.
that's more than enough, if you have more than 3 _active_ chats, you can't follow them all parallely anyway
GET OFF THE CHANNEL
yeah
and if they're not active, you can just meta+a
FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER FOREAVER
i will find you and eat you
Inbreed causes genetic mutations bro.
...
FORREVERRR
meta+a?
/me is caffeine crashing and feels dizzy. e-e;
*inbreeding
show last active window
well
/me hugs Fluttershy
/me offers a hoof to support Fluttershy.
show window with last activity
FOREAVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Reavers!
*Forever
/me runs to find a pillow for Fluttershy
forever? what about forgiveness?
No
:D
/me gives Fluttershy more caffeine
Awww... thanks guys. e-e; I really shouldn't have eaten so many coffee beans but they were just so yuuuuummyyyy
/me slaps DecapKing
Quick, get back to the ship!
Spin, what do you mean, inbreed?
We preach love and tolerance who said anything about ..*Blegh* Forgiveness
im doing nothing of the sort?
Forgiveness is not one of the elements of harmony, and is thus irrelevent
show last active window is actually something you use after taking a look at the other channel heh
Also, that was english
I don't like coffee, so I doubt I'd like the bean
/me yelps and jumps back from the sound of the slap.
why did you slap me?
=(
redd: "I SMELL MY SISTER"
hmmmmm
O_O
meh
/me shrugs
and you scared fluttershy
i meant that not in a naughty way
How smell you Sis
you sick
Derpy, the element of forgiveness. She has no long term memory.
I figured more Caffeine was bad
This show is kind of trippy right now... hehe... e_E;
/me shushes Fluttershy, trying to calm her. "It's okay, shy-shy."
Derp
i can smell my sister, its a family trait
lol
Sorry Fluttershy.. :o
Yes Yes I am..*realizes not something to proud about*
:/
Shy-Shy? XD
maybe his/her sister has a miasma of perfume?
*bre
oh
she can smell my blood from a mile away
johnsey: maybe if there was a way to have a summary list at the top with how many missed messages I had in every channel
/me lays down, closing her eyes. "That's a new nickname..." o-o
sorry, i give pet-names to fillies quite often
are you a shark?
and i can smell her blood from two miles
It's a pet name
Cute nickname
Are you a spy?
yes, i am a shark
that would make it work
SUCK MY DICK!!
Sharck are Cute
damn, ninja'd AGAIN!
I know, it just kinda made me grin
what? isnt the answer to a caffeine crash more caffeine?
that explains it
im afraid not
IM A SHARK!
no u
no. The answer to a caffeine crash is rest
9Trixie looked back at him. "Old habit of mine, disrobing before bed. I hope you don't mind." Without another word, Trixie walked into the immobile stage coach.
=
/me pulls a blanket out of hammer-space and drapes it over Shy-Shy
in before bans
im more of a shark spin
Gentlemen...I am ot spy.
*not
/me hoists spin up onto land
ot spy
Are u a Spy??
oh, well more caffeine for me then
im afraid not
Non!
Colgate: sounds like a very easy addon to write. There is already one that inserts a line into a chat window when you switch back to it, showing where you last read it
Oh, thank you Silvermane... ^^
Silver, you so careing.
POW POW
so he's the one true spy?
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa *dead*
/me stabs and kills everypony
/me is a Fillies-Colt
oo! oo! Can I be the spy? 8D
/me walks casually onto shore. *Deal With It*
:D
Hey, Silvermane, only Pinkie Pie can access Hammer Space
i deal with ypur me
uydsjkfiurfvbjidefvtcsjakl;\
since when is stabbing and killing friendship
Is it me, or have a few ponies forgotten that this is supposed to be PG?
Hammer Space?
well, for irssi at least but i reckon there should be for weechat as well
Hammer Time
a pocket dimension that has everything
Also, IAmNotAGoat, if this were TF2, nopony's stopping you sadly. xP
the place where giant hammers come from despite the size of pockets in shows
Redd is okay I hold you *hugs Redd impaling himself* Welp that didn't work out as planned
Sidestroke IKR
Thus the teams full of spies
/me is a Metal colt
K.
originally named for Silvermane's explanation
sometimes called mallet space
johnsey: well, I don't care about which one I use, since they really look the same(they even have the same color scheme by default)
Tf2 likes me =3
It's where bomberman keeps all his bombs.
Must be the 5th through 7th dimension of reality. :p

Thank you Cog

double teamed
well
Two mods, it seems.
that was interesting
teamwork

Yay!
There we go.

Teamwork is magic.

Sorry, I was on facebook. I just looked in.

15(Silvermane wears vests and jackets quite often)
It's alright
All cool
OHAI OCTAVIA!
I just came back in, and suddenly, spam
Hey Dashite
My little portal is pretty magic....al
oh grammar
Hi Octavia
13Hey Sumica
Hello 6th best pony, Octavia
4(DecapKing wears the hat he has from his days in Stalliongrad)
13 6th?! D:
hey Octavia
Anyone wanna share embarassing pony moments?
/me glomps Octavia
13Hey misguided SilverMane <3
Sorry, but you are the most outright beautiful pony at the least, Octavia
<3
I'll go first
13Hey Decap :P
me
sure.
/me 13is glomped on X3
I'm game
11(Well, it seems everypony here has an accessory or two!)
Octavia=my favorite pony
I read Bittersweet yesterday and spent all day today moping and crying
07hey!
11(inb4 you think Boombox is an accessory)
/me sobs in a corner
13Hey Luna :P
13:(
9In mere seconds, Boombox found himself on a bed next to the blue mare, very confused how it happened, and very /very/ curious as to why he was being held. Before he could beep an objection, the blue mare nuzzled him "Goodnight, Boombox." Her flat, sleepy tone struck a chord with him.
I have zero embarassing pony moments
/me 13goes to corner and hugs Luna
07foreveralone.jpg
to be perfectly honest
13lol
I would glomp too but I dont want to get bludgeoned with a doublebass
13Nup
Neither do I
/me 13comforts Luna
4(also i have a pair of saddlebags to carry my vodka in)
I don't have any good ones, I think, I'm kinda boring XD
This one time, I was watching an episode and my sister comes downstairs in full view on my monitor.
/me hugs Luna. "You are 2nd best pony, but I loves you"
11(*deep forlorn sigh()
Luna's face when every pony is my favorite pony
Brother usually uses my Ipod for music in car. Car full of females( excluding me and my bro) Get in forgot pony music playlist.. First song that comes blasting through speakers is Winter Wrap Up. Retrieve Ipod and switch to bros shitty Lil Wayne playlist play it off cool
13So whos the best pony then Silver? :P
/me is happy again
and then shebecame a brony?
Luna's face when Silvermane says that to all the fillies...
Fluttershy
lol@ spin
13Yay, happy Luna is best Luna <3
13Ahhh.
I've had no such embarrassing pony moments, I keep myself well-concealed!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV4IaC4YmHY
Oki that was ep one might show more later if people want.
Twilight told me this video is about TF2 Is A Perfect Video Game
13I can agree with that. For the mane 6 anyway.
lol Blums. she actually tried to spy on me to see if i would continue watching
Huh?
I don't have any yet...
o-o Yes Silvermane?
Dashite, I do not. I, in fact, do not love Applejack or Rainbow Dash
13^ X3
Fluttershy, I was saying you are best pony.
/me likes moe
she secretly wanted to see more
(pronounce moe-ay)
you say that to every filly you have ever dated SilverMane
Silvermane likes the barkeep.
Great Silvermane, now they're going to cry themselves to sleep tonight
she did once i mentioned it as a movie night choice
Ya I still haven't revealed it to my family but my bro probably figured out after that and when he used my computer when I wasn't home I had my wallpaper of the Mane6
herospirit, they'll get over it
Hey
Oh my goodness Full Metal Panic! I love this show!
oh hai thar fullmetal panic
after all, they have each other
XD
what is it about?
13Oh goodness...
Never seen this show
Mechs
/me has never seen this, but has always wanted to
13Full Metal Panic, what are the odds...
and boobs
WELL! I'm quite happy. Seeing as the the yogscast just had a huge MLP rant!
suddenly nudity
My parents do know, I don't really think they know the extent of it though.
13This is one of the animes my roomie has been watching lately...
Simon watched it at least
Still need to figure out how I'm gonna explain it to my mom when my Derpy hooves shirt comes in the mail.
Hi Octavia
/me blushes. "I started watching this show like five years ago."
Odds seem pretty good apparently.
is this the good kind of mecha?
2 of my fav things par 2 getting mashed into 1 video
LOL
Its pretty good yeah
Simply amazing
13Hi Barry
there is a bad kind?
/me daaws at the thought of Fluttershy blushing
Yes
I'd actually like to get a shirt of RD
Robots is my fetish
/me hugs his only 6-named favorite ponies
but how do i go about asking parents..
Plus the fluttershy flashdrive and the maybe the gummy shirt will require explanation.
I wonder if anyone has a hip toatto of any of the ponies cutie marks
Yay, we're watching it from the beginning. ^^ This is such an awesome series.
xD
I just asked her to shop online
foreshadowing
Why not explain it, then?
what SilverMane, no brohoof?
Probably, Somewheres in some place. In the back of some dark alley
huh?
Theres a cutiem ark specialist
mark*
I mean, there's plenty of valid reasons why this is a great show. Why hide it?
/me brohoofs DecapKing. FLUTTERSHY YA
I guareentee!
PENGUIN SAYS GET THE FUCK UP.
/me is an anime nut btw
/me returns the brohoof
My mom gave my guff when she found out I'm still a virgin..my mom's a pothead and probably more masculine than me
I always have a knack for making up clever cutie marks
this is my first time watching anime in forever
*nom*
Sidestroke: because I'd be called a gay lunatic or something
i.e., they have a secondary meaning
/me convinced a filly to go to the park for a few hours and then anime club on this saturday.
her thumb must be derishoush
9Something deep within his processors and circuitry and just behind the ice cream maker, changed. The mare he was sleeping next to... She really thought of him as a friend. She barely knew him, and she really needed him to be her friend.
Wow spin, Sounds like a nice life you got there
yep
Then those people can go, if you'll pardon my french, f*ck off. They're too shallow to realize that it's a good show just based on it's looks.
it's really hard to tell your friends about FiM when they know that you're gay and will think that's why ;-;
Lolnope
Lovely
Xmen.
whoo still out of it e-e heh...
15(inb4 cable sex)
Oh, yeah
This is where Sabretooth comes in.
4(bow chicka wow wow)
I've told 2 close friends I like MLP and they're cool with it, so that makes me happy.
Eh, id just rather keep my bronieness to myself
Horrible aim1
Sidestroke, internet hoofbump. right now.
/me 11wonders whats wrong with his friends
I got a couple friends who're cool with it.
why are the russians in this so cruel?
Colson: I know what you mean-- the ol' power of deduction often comes to wrong conclusions
/me drapes a foreleg about Fluttershy, comfortingly.
Its either this my megalomaniac uncle or my religious fanatic ex-methhead father though my uncle was loaded.
lol, I've only told one of my friends
My friends probably arent aware of ponies and ponies wouldnt concern them at all, so I just dont mention them and if they ask, i'll tell
because they are you decap
All of them are you
/me brohoofs immediately
it makes me feel bad about my people
EXTREME BROHOOF!
/me blushes at Silvermane, but smiles.
well that would make sense
/me 15has seen too much hentai and read to many... things
/me brohooves EXTREMLY
:<
15(yfw I'm seducing Fluttershy in mane-chat)
The stress of handling so many bodies at once has driven you mad
4(and probally writen most of them)
Could this be the start of Silvershy?
15(decapking, shh, spoilers)
Can I confess that I've never used any of this pony-relevent lingo until now? I feel like 20% more uncool than before XD
11(I need to know if there are any tentacle clopfics.)
11(For science)
I mean, if I had an opportunity I'd wear brony t-shirts every day. Nothing like shoving it down their throats if they don't like it while also possibly converting some people a little more open-minded.
Sumica. shhh, spoilers
Awwww
Come on
dont be silly Iamnotagoat, nopony should feel bad about how they are
Blums has been for awhile
rofl
Well I am trying to reel in the closet bronies by wearing my Power level hiding t shirts (Gummy "pimping aint easy", and my Madame le flour)
the whole point of being a brony is....well im not entirely sure, But it sure it fun :)
rape face?
been what for a while?
I don't use bronyisms.
ive seen enough Law and Order SVU to know where this is going
Also Hi Ghosties
Yes
brb guys real quick. I'm going to get off, then get back on [but it wont be me] then I'll get back on again and it really will be me
so brb!
Neither do I
It refuses to accept passwords when you sign up
I wish I had some pony paraphernalia
4Oh, hey
I'm not a hardcore fan, I guess
Bronyiality, That's the only reality for me
/me hugs Fluttershy as she falls asleep.
ah
wat
Funny considering I'm always on this chatroom
4Great streaming, Sumica!
Oh good, acceptance is magic
hey Ghosties
I've used "Eeeyup," a few times, but that's common enough for plausible deniability.
/me hugs Ghosties
Okay, i'm free now guys
oh hai ghosties
I still want that Trixie sweatshirt that had concept art done a while back
But it's really the community
Thanks
I didn't join a cult.
Hey, look, it's Progress-Luna: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/165/686/abacus.jpg?1314112568
?
I only use bronyisms with bronies. Though occasionally a Aeeeeyup slips out
Nashy: what makes you so sure about that? :O
a mr. turnip shirt sounds cool too
/me loves Progress: Luna Vs.
Plorf: Yeah I like the show but I became a brony for the awesome community.
free for what SilverMane?
Calling bronies a cult is more the type of behavior I'd expect at derpyhooves.com
13Lmao
4Hey guys
Yes. You joined a *sunglasses* Colt!
I need a good place to pick up some of the brony swag, but I can't find a quality online store ugggh
Smooth inuendo Kurt.
YEAAAH
Anyway
Seems like a cult to some people.
XD
are all anime shows like this?
(For science? Un-huh...)
Iamnotagoa: 1 sec
People who are close-minded
DecapKing, shipping in general
Sidestroke: http://yeahbutton.com
cult? implying that we dont let members leave
Yup Goat
an no, not all are anything like this
like what?
http://ocularproof.spreadshirt.com/
and mostlikly the answer is no
And yeah, it's not a cult, but just a reeeeeeaaaaally active fanbase.
I mean, it's not like we do weird cult junk...like human sacrifice....
11(I need to run tests on how effective it is=Science)
AND YAY~! Thank you Spin
full of inuendo, giant robots, violence, so on
anime is like any other show; varies as widely as the creatores
Like, reeeeeeeeeee*etc*ally.
/me sacrifices IAmNotAGoat
inb4 condom joke
4(no Razyn, just no)
is this where I say no only the good ones
The community is not a cult, but some act like they are part of one.
i think cults are more about taking actions to prevent people from leaving the group

9 ...Aside from Razyn, Boombox had never met someone so lonely. It made him sad, knowing that somepony didn't have a single friend. He recorded only one thing as he entered sleep mode. He had to stay with this mare for as long as he could. Until she at least found more friends of her own.

how do you know my alias SilverMane?
And I'm not looking to dump a ton of money into it or play seriously at lots of tournaments, I just wanna have some cards to play with friends
Hmmm
My bro has like 1000
Well then it's probably good. I saw one opened and it gives you pretty much all the basics you'll need.
http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Deck_Builder%27s_Toolkit_2011 Here's a spoiler, idk what's good
How goes
4 boosters and 125 other cards, hmm
haha http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/ponies.html so true
That's on a need to know basis
BOOKS
depends on what the other cards are
damn you seth
They sell them at my locals for $20
I think I will be using Rainbow_Dash for the time being
.
The way I look at it, 4 packs is $16 right
So you're paying $4 for a buncha extra cards
confound these ponies, they drive me to buy lisenced shirts
.
Yeah, and $4 for the rest is a good price.
/me is sad that ReticentSmolder/MirthTinker is grounded
The intro deck I bought is Blood and Fire
*sigh* you sir are being stubborn but its okay I don't want to discuss anymore maybe someone else does but have fun :)
Also, if you know someone down in a fight, make sure they don't get back up for a while!

http://cosplay.paheal.net/post/view/45358
I think the toolkit was released in 2011
i want that suit
So I dunno when it's gonna get rotated out
/me is glad that he isnt grounded
(I don't have any idea how/when Magic's set rotation works)
And you're not making much sense to me, so probably for the best.
paheal? pretty sure do not want
ewll, the 125 cards does have quit a few good cards for standard, if that's what you want
To each his own.
Magic sets rotate at the end of September. I forget when new Toolkits are released, though.
My mom taught me her ethics for fighting. There is no such thing as dirty fighting.
To my knowledge there's only been two
doom blade, condemn, mana leak
One in 2010, one in 2011

That suit's...not too bad. Don't think I would ever wear one though.
I'll be
bet
paheal is kinda famous for it's rule34
Evening, everpony.
there is quite a bit of trashy cards though
you'll be bet
I dunno if one is coming out in 2012 or not, cuz if there is I'd just wait for that one y'know
Yeah, but I don't know what month they were released in.
hey Octavia
dirty fighting only exists when sparring
LIES ALL LIES
Now I'm wishing I had ended the debate earlier because I have no idea what you guys are talking about now :P
hi tavi
thats nice SilverMane, although from you alone shouldnt the pony race be extinct?
2011 was May, 2010 was March so
Hi Octavia!
err, flip those months
2011 march, 2010 may
Dohoho
Yesh Silvermane, that's different, of course.
lol DecapKing. Why would I do that when i get ALL the fillies?
Well hello.
...And RS
because its a lie
Oh god... that Amnesia video... XD
Oh. I have my years mixed up. Talking about Magic core 2012
That one time.
Made me think it was the year 2012
WELL THEN.
and RS that one time... *sigh*
:)
Yeah see Colgate I figured there's trashy cards in them
Yugioh's the same way
But I dunno which are trashy
he's asleep. bot
Dari always lurks
I see
Yo dawg I'm pro at Yugioh!
No you're not.
Yugioh has no pros.
Someone has to be pro
most cards are pretty easy to tell if they are bad ;)
Not if there's no pro circuit
dem anime sound effects
Behold, your new overlord
Hell Ya I am I gots that Pyro dragon negro!

FUUUU
I sense this night's drawfriend having a nice splash of applejack
And so did that annoying Boombox..
You said "If you find a local Friday Night Magic, they'll probably give you free lands"
Is it a true PMV if it includes original (non-show) animation (not including effects or modifications)?
/me glomps Fluttershy without colliding into the floor.
...? ...*
wings babay
if it has music and is a video related to pony
Russians speaking Japanese?
cant explain that
Well I don't wanna be a bum either
I am admin?
I don't wanna be all "YO GIMME YO LANDS"
Mithrils ass
TOO mUCH POWER
HNNNNG
There was a very OP card that taps to make a land a 3/3 flying that is also a land
Why not?
:0
=O
Hello triple!
That wasn't overpowered....
wut is dis
How are you!
bueno
/me had an idea for a PMV that looks really great in my head, but there's several issues. 1: I can use a video editor, but not well enough to do any lip sync. 2: the idea would require some original animation (especially Spike) and I don't know a thing about flash.
te gusta?
uhh
Fluttershy has been AFK for 37 minutes
Filter: I think you're thinking of http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Mishra%27s+Factory
i guess....
bien
not quite the same, but still a very good card
nah, it was somethin else
/me cries that he glomped a comatose pegasus
0.0
ohyea! snow lands only
came in a snow deck though
Not only that, you glomped a comatose pegasus that probably didnt really want to be suddenly glomped
dat scary angry face
dat lag
?
All i know about flash is newframe, draw, newframe,draw, newframe, draw
Anyway
You should feel ashamed..
XD
Thanks for the info Colgate, FallSilently
I haven't seen a snow land in a long time
dat upskirt
well I used my wings to keep us in the air, so she wouldn't get hurt
it was a creature that makes snow lands into 3/3 flyings
all i know about flash is: ..
and still lands
I'm a bit disappointed that the Toolkit doesn't have Divination in it
though I play legacy almost exclusively now, so yeah
kana is such a troll

Y'know, I think I can cosplay Big Mac.
the fact that chat has become nearly silent

Well Friday Night Magic is Standard

lets have an orgy
Im not sure if I should be laughing or crying at that
PG Pony orgy/
4the fact this chat is silent
*?
I'm 10 and what is this
an overindulgance of pony watching?
PG
Or both
PG 13
triple: Apple Jack - Mmm, nah.
What the poop did I miss?
either that, or he is an idol-obsessed nut job
nope.avi
also, WHAT THE HELL
Well, if I can get some Divinations from the common bin at locals, why not
dat boob grab
I just made $70 from selling some Yugioh cards anyway
The vast majority of what's in the Toolkit will be Standard-legal for another year. A handful of the M11 cards may leave in a few weeks.
Remember, the next rotation occurs just a couple weeks.
But most of that is going towards a box of Photon Shockwave
did she just... enjoy that? In an anime? That's a first. normally they just hit the guy. yay realism
Ahh, ok.
So uh how's it work
When that gothic horror set comes out.
XD
11...is not a sentence.
Anime girls are always so vicious.
How I imagine a PG orgy= "mmm yeah hold my hand!! OH YEAH! You too don't be shy Hold it nice and tight! OH YEAH!!"
(Man, those double-faced cards that set introduces are weird.)
/me 15is busy humping nightmare moons leg
Yeah I Saw those
Yugioh just introduced a new type of monster too
Dynamic exit!
They were slow on getting official rulings out, so one card broke $200 on secondary market
/me 11is about to go exercise insix
dat chill face
But then when the new rulebook came out, it dropped to $80
Soooooooooo a PG orgy is essentially Fluttershy.
Then people raged for spending $600 on a set
http://ponyspin.com/
:V
hentai-san?
Hentai-San...
I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh! but I hear their rulings system is a mess.
is that like the girl name Yuri?
It's making progress.
dat dramatic train jump
where it isn't the perversion we think it is?
They recently introduced a new syntax for card text to eliminate a lot of confusion.
I don't try to understand yugioh anymore XD
no it's just as it sounds
LOL
The cartoon has become quite ridicilous or so I hear/
Doing a bit of pony sketching, hopefully my internet doesn't fail me now. http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
Anything involving the damage step is cryptic and pandora's box-y
This guy...
And explaining priority to players is a nightmare too
jumping out of a train is a coincidence?
He is so fucking smooth. "suddenly I wanted to get off at this station"
Especially to so-called "pro players" who fling the term around and really don't know what it means -_-
It makes the judge in me pissed off
Especially kids who can't take ajoke.
priority is just who has the chance to play a spell, or use any ability
Exactly.
I've heard players saying
if both players pass, something happens
I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh
"I'M USING MY PRIORITY" or "I HAVE PRIORITY"
it is pretty simple!
err
I play Magic The Gathering
*RETAIN
There's reasons I stick with Magic.
hello everypony !
You don't "use" priority, you either have it or you don't
Going to refresh the stream after this ep.
roushguy: well, it is the same in mtg
Also: "He gets priority, so I use his effect"
Cards never have priority, only players do
Colgate, in Japan, they changed the way Ignition effects work
ignition?
You can no longer play an Ignition effect in response to a successful summon
dat upskirt
dem panties
again, upskirt
YOU ARE ALREADY PARTYING
Yeah, like Exiled Force for example
dat ass
It's just an effect you manually activate.
Got hold of a Naya deck, and did some major revamping with critters old and new. I've got around 40 creatures, only seven or so instants/enchants/sorceries, and 21 lands
And so, Japanese kids watch this every day on TV?
XD
Full Metal Panic: I watch it for the plot
-what i'll say when someone enters the door on a party
Nyan deck?
what's going on there ?
Nope. Japanese teenagers :P
Priority is usually used in discussion involving Ignition effects since that's when it most commonly gets brought up.
roushguy: that's uh, a big deck
Sticking to 60 cards is always best, though.
Eh, close enough =P
dat cat
slim it down to 60
So lets start a convo where its not 2 people hogging the chat please..
Nah
Trust me
If priority went away in Yugioh, then Yugioh would not even exist as a game -_-
It gets going, it's near impossible to stop without disenchantment.
feeling like Fluttershy in the begging of the episode dragonshy
Spin: I see six or seven people hogging the chat. Feel free to hog some yourself.
normally anime like this would be prime time or late night.
I'd still love for the mane six to hop on my back so I can carry 'em around. That'd be the best time of my life for some reason.
speaking and no one notice
Wild Pair, Lurking Predators, and a ton of 5/5's
So *ehem* How about them ponies..
And 6/6's
priority is kind of important.... so you can't just chain stuff off of yourself without your opponent having a chance
Yeah.
dat blush
FUCK YOU GUYS< DRAWFRIENDS I HERE
I've heard a palyer, who is a veteran of several years say during a duel
That evil laugh
> join stream
> that laugh
Dat weird ass laugh
She is Rarity
"You can't do that, priority doesn't exist anymore."
It sounds a bit fragile, roushguy, but I'd have to see it to get a really good idea.
Quick, we must map the characters to the mane 6!
I wanted to flip a table
It is fragile
I mean
better have some fetches to get those lurker predators

aww the applejack one didnt make it on the drawfriend
what a crime
I love the last one
I was actually thinking about Scootaloo giving tickets to Rainbow Dash earlier today
/me hugs Fluttershy. "I missed you"
What are we watching now?
I can predict the future!!
SilverMane is thinking "Want or do not want"
hey Fluttershy
/me blushes. "Awww...."
DecapKing, I do not want Pinkamina
Sweaters are not as good as socks. This is fact. This is reality.
Hey there. ^^; Sorry for suddenly disappearing. I got super hungry so I went to get dinner.
I will agree on that
I can't handle such an... energetic filly
#9: "GRAB MY TAIL, SCOOTALOO!"
dat ass shot
SilverManes mind
How hard would we hav to try to get Twilight's VA to narrorate "Go the Fuck to Sleep"?
Homework time
"I watch it for the plot"
o-o Things certainly got interesting in here, too.
Homework...
untz
Again, sorry for disappearing suddenly... ^^; I was really, really hungry
thanks for reminding me
4mfw this chat is still silent
aw snap. totally forgot to finish mine
:S

Lol
/me 11is going to exercise now. If you're complaining, start shipping!
07what's with the bunny ears..?
haha lets see if I can multitask as well as I think I can
I can predict the future

Luna, because.
I was thinking about Scootaloo giving Rainbow Dash tickets earlier today
No problem, spin ;)
07and cat ears too..
just when i think i start to understand anime, i get lost again
07I see!
oh dear... I have a pic for you guys
/me sits down and starts slirping up his pasta
IRC + homework = no homework completed
Same reason cat ears wander around my school
4mfw this chat is still silent
Because Japan
What are we watching
it's the law all maids in japan must ware them.
15LOUD NOISES

Well, anyhow, bedtime for me.

gnight
Gnightyy
Star driver
Night
The man in the red. His body shape frightens me
Goodnight Equestria! There will be no encores.
ponies + x = x not completed
And now I feel like some sort of prophet
^
XD
^
what kind of picture Fluttershy?
^
WHY DOES HE NEED SUCH BROAD SHOULDERS FOR SUCH THIN ARMS
(Pinkie_Pie, am I coming on too strong? It's been a while since I done some pursuing)
also dat weird body figure
c-c-c-combo breaker
fu
Erm..
:(
lol
It's somthing that is common for this artist style herospirit
talking about fetishes and all... this is one I saw and I was like 'oh my goodness he did not just...'
Kinda like code geass
mmmeh.
I have seen this before
If x = more ponies, what then?
>>;
/me walks over to Fluttershy and gives her the biggest of hugs. "DAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW"
hey cocoa
lol nice
then it is ponies
DONT PING HIM.
x^x
Hey
hmm? why?
/me is hugged, blushes. "Hi there..."
Fluttershy what have you done
Why?
mmmeh.
ponies + more ponies= 2(ponies)
o-o what do you mean...?
lol Fluttershy that image
lol
:D
AAGH, MATH
great. algebra
ok that was an odd image
I believe you mean "dat" image
1. I don't get pinged, I get hilights, and 2. I don't mind being mentioned because I want to know if I miss something :P
Algebra's easy. I just HATE it.
The King of Shipping asked you a question, miss Pie. Or is it miss Dash, now.
heh... ^^;
exactly
What are we watching anyways? :0
i started pre calc this year. i miss algebra now
4mfw i come back tommorow and Fluttershy is in here
I'm in the middle of studying brain anatomy. Not so bad but I always feel like I'm missing something.
good question o-o
I dont have dark shades to go with it herospirit
I get pinged /and/ highlited
hawhawhaw
Dash, I suppose
Star driver
And, how should I know?
I have one better...
You are the King of Shipping, you should know what you are doing >.>
http://miburl.com/DRwKXd
6Code monkey like fritos~ Code monkey like youuuuuuu~
dat ass
of course you do SilverMane.....
psh, RL n00bs, Calculus is where it's at
15shh, spoilers
Trig this year and I hate not because it hard but because its the normal Trig class so all the seniors make the class agonizingly slow and easy
I wish my math classes were like that. :[
DecapKing, it is one of my wallpapers that rotate in and out
i wish my java class was like that
and it makes me go DAAWWWWWWWWW
I sit there for like 20 mins doodling while he explains everything 10 times makes me mad
it went too fast for me
OH GOD HER FACE
Luna's face is so cute. full of OMFGYAY~
do you want to see my wallpaper?
I know how you feel, Spin
/me loves it
K6inb4 red haired L from DeathNote?
yes
but my mandarin class was the exact opposite holy hell thats hard
math was always TOO easy for me
Herospirit, check the bunker, y- OMG
THAT FACE
Could you repost as a link Silvermane?
Math was always easy for me. Then Calculus happened.
Shes evil...
I hated that class because there was nothing to do most of the time!
/me loves that Luna and Celestia picture~
/me is jelly
Calculus is always a stumbling block
Herospirit, I am a prophet
I think numbers is my foreign language
07saved!
was and is terrible at maths
/me just realized that the image Fluttershy posted is by the same artist as what I posted
*native
I predicted this picture earlier today
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dJIohYF4SgM/TmgG3v6rP0I/AAAAAAAALuE/ojP9ixzwE_M/s1600/tickets_to_your_friendship_by_ctb_36-d493d9y.png
I heard :p
Indeed.
remove period at end of that link
Lol
I just failed pretty hard
eeyup
Yesh, I know :p
/me will let this get to her head
I am so bad at the maths.
lawl maths
4so is that a yes?
...well, not horribly bad, more just the upper-class stuff.
Also, one of my favorite artists for some reason
so what do you call it math's?
maths's?
theoretical maths!
15probably not
Im bad a grammers too
i just can't get back into the swing of things at school
aparrently
You know you do too much math when you use equations to memorize your phone numbers
4awww, but it would be interesting!
I just noticed we are almost at 37k.
YAY
Maths. Maths's stupid. (England or wherever :3)
4and possibly funny!
37k?
i find myself thinking over approach procedures for salt lake intl when i should be taking a test
xD
i like it when the numbers go to zero
oh on eq
37m huh
I's silly
hurr*
so all that was the stuff before the opening credits
HI TWILIGHT!
6Certainly does very good detail. . .
Somehow I can see Luna doing that
crap my homewrok :P
4dat Fluttershy face in the background
I was gonna ask, does this show have an intro or no? And then intro.
/me does not get the add-y things
hi TwilightSparkle_
lods of emone
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-ubJqgtKSw
Hello!
Lol. I'd ask for a scoop of ice cream for every hundred years I was on the moon.
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Lods of emone
6Only ten scoops? D:
breasts
3Hello again.
wow Herospirit, not hard to satisfy you is it
I suck at english though not because I can't write but because I hate the stupid "layout" bs i.e. MLA format plus the whole Thesis statement BS
/me in which plorf posts more youtube videos
6<.<
1000 years on the moon, and all you want is 10 scoops of ice cream?
oh man, I can either write a lot in terms of essays
or nothing
it tends to be nothing
Must be realy good
my mind is sort of turning in on itself
i would ask for a can of red bull for every 100 years i spent on the moon
I hold my grudges quietly.
"Write an essay on this random picture of two people's feet we found off google images
My mind clicks off of focusing on something occassionally.
4hey
My brain basically becomes Derpy.
15oh look at that
Just kidding, I suck at holding grudges
/me 15punches Denied_Existence in the face. "DON'T SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT"
my mind can never focus very long
Worst thing is embedding quotes I'm liek what If I jsut put em in a box somewhere and refer to em that way.and by box i mean trash and by trash I mean recycle bin because I like trees.
Over the past few days, I've legitimately though I've been going insane
6SO MAAAAA-- Not mad anymore~
3ow...
ITSAH PINCH
IT'S A PIIINCH
ITSAHPIIIINCH
ITSAHPIINCHEH
i like that pony is everywhere comic
6Red haried Ryuzaki. . .
Falco paaaa fail
IT'S AHPAWWWWWWNCH
ITS A PUNCH
6FALCON MISS
Plorf: I know that feel
That comic is basically me after injected with pony.
15sorry
15now then, you must bring in Emerald some time. I must witness this shipper filly first hand
15i like the placement of that floating piece of paper
Comic?
Lol
ISCHAPINCH
Thats the funniest thing I have heard on an Anime so far
Somehow
Yeah, after ponies, that comic describes it all.
Must see said comic
And possibly a new Bronystate in-meme
Did I mention I could possibly cosplay Big Macintosh?
It's funny
lol
I find engrish hilarious to begin with, TBH :P
yes
3kk. But she isn't always available.
Rease, from Malcom ?
Falcon... PAUNCH!!
*dreams of ponies* FFUUUUUU
Ugh.. was gonna do something but I totally forgot what it was just before I was gonna do it
CAPITEN, FALKOHN!
Dumb Brain.
/me has dreamed of pony about 7 times in the past 3 weeks.
Blonde hair, green eyes, buff. Eeyup, now all I need is a costume and a hat.
Rarity - Now all you need is a hat!
are you red?
the other day i had this weird dream that rarity was making me clothes
suddenly giant robots
didn't think so
You watched the F-Zero anime?
I missed the name of this. AGAIN. WHAT ARE WE WATCHING
lolwut?
Star driver
Star Driver, I think
Filter: Gotta find a red costume and put BM's cutie mark on the back.

And Barry, naw, just that scen
scene*
ninja'd so that's a yes :P
3...
3Silvermane is in loooovee <3
I liek mudkips
Well, that's interesting
Who doesn't?
I was informed of a family problem with one of my cousins
3http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/6.png
4is that even possible?
I too has a feeling of positivity towards the group of pixels that is Mudkip
Though I think sharing it would derail the chat
Well I have brown hair green eyes and I am average weight and slightly below hieght all I need is 4 hooves. Blonde paint. Mane. Tail. Gray paint and lazy eye.
I want to write an anime where the main character ISN'T one of the chosen ones.
ShadTheCrazed: paint yourself red and run around naked! :)
3I have no clue.
3But then again, I barely know him
filter: Fluttershy - NO!
15didn't see that image
Filter: but then Fox can say thats what we all do ..oh wait IT IS.
LOL
yes that is his name
15also, I'm technically involved with MirthTinker in this channel
Galactic Pretty Boy
Mhm....
all two of three anime I've seen are murder mysteries, soo... yeah
* all of three
3Oh Silver, your just jealous that I have such a good writer all to myself~
/me logs off, takes of clothes, and steps out the door
oh no, Rose
I've forgotten how to speak English apparently, *All of the three.
There's this really cool series on Science channel called Dark Matters, about science experiments gone wrong or too far.
I just imagined a news cast with videos of dudes running around covered in bright paint holding ponies screaming quotes from the show.. god I hope that doesn't find me in my sleep.
15it was a pretty /short/ lived coupling, IMO
/me opens the door
/me gets on the floor
/me everybody walks the dinosaur
hes so fabulous
3Well DecapKing wasn't exactly giving her much to work with was he?
yeah, I understand what you mean
Darn cops ruined all my fun
Sounds like eurika 7
lols
3No offense DecapKing
Fast cops
15hehe definitely not >.>
fat cops

They're watching you all
15:D
I know!
:D
3So. What do we do now?
all the power of fabulosity
3Pick up somewhere?
15ILU DecapKing
/me squeezes Plorf tightly
/me is squeezed
By the fabulous invested in me, I just kicked your ass
Sounds like something he would say?
Lol
4Bro's for life Silvermane
*ehem* wouldn't it be fun to run around covered in paint?
I wonder should I torment you with this one.
(itsapeeeench)
Run around covered in paint
NAKED
15brohoof
ITSAPIINCH
I hate it when people lower my chair.

Squid girl ^_^
I'm up for some torture
Okay

Spah zapping mah chair
I know that show. FUCKING DO IT FILLY
torture is my fetish
4yeah so would i

are we suggesting anime to stream now?
oh wait what
:D
15i don't have a fetish or anything >.>
WOOT
3I probably would too...but rarity isn't really my type.
/me restrains himself
3xD
what ? run around covered with pain ?
are you crazy ?
/me blinks. "Are you okay?"
or requesting, rather
No, Ziltoid, it's nothing dirty. Before you ask :P
Oatmeal!
No more crushing Fluttershy, Silvermane. No more of that.
<Pinkie Pie> Are you loco in the coco?
DAMMIT
17th :D
!s2
Ziltoid is dissipoint
Season 2 begins in 9d:11h:32m:11s
^^; Ahaha... it's okay, really.
what?
So, is this gonna be the weirdest thing I have ever seen?
/me smiles at her concern. "I've just been hyper and I don't want to bend any of your feathers"
it just might
Season 2. Best birthday gift.
now whats this
Probably not Dashie
wut
/me wonders how one runs around covered in pain
this intro song
Jesus.
Sumica, can we make them watch Bobobo next? :3
15Rarity is the the most... something of the mane 6
9 days...
So they know what "weird" is
It's the only thing keeping me going through school
/me blinks. "Well, they all seem fine for now." ^^
I dont have bobobobobobo
Weird? FLCL.
Damn. 3:
just 9 days...
AtomicCocoa
Yes i have FLCL
15mfw Fluttershy is enjoying the attention in #bunker
I heard about an anime where there are soda cans that turn into hot girls.
thunder-colt: what happens come the end of S2
?
Does anypony know what 'Welcome to the NHK' is perchance? o-o
This cant be as weird as that..
3Howso?
'Sup
Are you insane in the membrane?
we do stuff again
i watch it all starting from season 1 again
ANARCHY!!
/me Smirks. "Well if that's the case..." He glomps Fluttershy
hey Fluttershy
durr
Loco in the coco
*try to control excitation, impatence, and something*
Rainbow Dash, watch Bobobo sometime
My apologies to those who were watching my stream, my interet had a super-derp.
It'll blow that out of the water
yeah it's not that echii Rainbow_Dash
yes
I love squids
15;D
it seems you have found your way into the Bunker
stream?
squids are my fetish
Hi Denied_Existence
what stream
Is cool
4and hey PP
don't rely on pegasi D_D
Hi Rainbow_Dash
I was streaming me drawing ponies.
She didnt find her way Decap, I let her in
That's nice, Ziltoid
>.>
Also, I am Pinkie_Pie, I will be using this nick for a while
HotCocoa: You never talk as AtomicGone-y anymore
/me is glomped, squeaks then laughs. ^^ "Hehe..."
I hate waiting so much
link? :)
squid rage
lolwut
perhaps nichijou would be good.
why is that squid talking
http://www.livestream.com/skipsysdoodles
I'll be live in a second.
streams are too mainstream, I only watch creeks
hello?
because fuck physics
hihello
Colgate: lol
oh dear
Filter: you mean AtomicBrony?
*silence*
And no, I don't.
so... what are we talking about?
you
ja
what the squid am I watching?
I have to wait for s2 and my shirts to mail in must keep ponies contained.
FLCL then...? o-o
O_o
I've seen... 3 episodes, I think?
3I am tempted to RP right now...
>GET A GUN!
I am squidly confused
I haven't actually watched FLCL, one of my friends has told me repeatedly that it's bizarre, so :P
3But I don't know what or why...
then you have seen half of them
IN MY MOUTH!
I'm gonna try to make RBD shirts this weekend.
must see
So FLCL next then?
Sure
/me picks Fluttershy back up, dusting her off. "Sorry, I'm just, ermm, /friendly/ i suppose."
night all!
Not to sell, though. I'm just slapping RBD's cutie mark on the shirt.
I still want some Bobobo on this stream someday.
4right, /friendly/
inb4 someone orders squid
Maybe find a red one and put Big Mac's Cutie Mark on it.
mfw fastest shipping ever
I would rep both of those pretty hard
Oh, it's okay. -doesn't get it- o-o
Can't wait to get my Derpy hooves shirt and my gummy one okay all of em
4you would have to look through my mind to get it
who now Silvermane
/me is the shipping king >.>
what they say changes completely when you change the language on Bobobo. I guess it was because they just said "Fuck it this doesn't make sense just say whatever" anyways.
every time I hear someone say sorry in Japanese I immediately think of "USODA"
i want a spitfire shirt
Maybe put Luna's cutie mark on a dark blue shirt.
squid bitch and lemon shirt
gnight
lol
and a socks woona shirt
I have cutie mark pins
......0_o
I came to a realization
/me 8hums quietly to herself.
so I can turn a non-brony shirt into a brony shirt in 10 seconds flat
There comes a point when you know you're in too deep.
I had like 70$ to spend and my mom said I had to get jeans so instead of buying 40$ jeans I got like 5$ off ebay and got 4 MLP shirts :P
never
And that you can never go back
We seriously need more Bronies in Tennessee. ;n;
never too deep! moar pony!
I decided to play a classic game
This amuses me.
/me 4just sits there and hums "Wait and Bleed" to himself
One of my favorites of all time
Spin: that is what you do :D
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
oh she mad
And then
/me shuffles off carefully, suddenly nervous. "Nope, nothing to see here, not a crazy fanboy or anything"
/me 3strums a guitar.
As I played, I thought...
and here I thought that was a bit of dirt on my screen, then it started flying
You know what this needs
?
8Mmmm! I got a piece of spice cake with my dinner and I'm so glad I did. It's delicious! ^^
PONY
also, rum & coke, I have missed you so much
Plorf: I don't understand.
3~Decaps been shipping, with mares all day~
Basically
EVERYTHINV NEEDS MORE PONY.
3~Will his mind continue to stay?~
^
moar
^
What is a pony?! A miserable pile of friendship!
*everything
wow
4sadly, probably not
3~I may know, but its a conspiracy~
IVE SEEN ENOUGH HENTAI
Who is the origin of the memetic face
inb4 the genre changes
*miserable LITTLE
Oh I didn't know that
Lol :p
So many people forget that word
cept for scootaloo
3~Shipping is awesome...I mean seriously~
http://noplan.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dave-silverman.jpg
We need to ponyify Bayonetta. THAT IS FINAL, FILLIES.
okay...*processing* lol
You always expect it but it never happens.
shes just misserable
Hayonetta
And they accepted that meme and put it on their door
8brb again sorry! ><
Mmmm, cake
Hay, I'm a colt, not a filly.
4actually that would be pretty fun to lose my mine....
/me waves bye to Fluttershy
leaving, that was just a short visit
4*mind
3Your mine?
good night
4it would suck to lose my mine
gnight
We are all Brony here
Night
4cause then someone would get blown up probably
dat sound effect
3Why would it be fun to lose your mind?
the wet squishing and flopping... *shudder*
I'm a hony.
4it would make things interesting
Or a pega-sis
RAPE FACE
I don't remember which episodes are in the first... uh.... episode
lol wut
they mispelled "cannon"
/me lost it years ago, so he replaced it. It doesn't fit, but it's still useful
to the moon?
> moon cannon
I don't like making a seperate term for females ponies.
Oooh, my DL is done. ^_^
We call them normal
haha
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Working Celestia Moon Canon in Minecraft (http://tinyurl.com/3aw773d)
lol
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV2vfWUFtJ8&feature=related
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Stu Pierces The Heavens At 4 In the Morning
3So....we doing any RP'ing today for any reason?
We need to take this scene, and put it with ponies.
So femailes should just be lumped together with a male term?
4besides it would give me a reason to wear my gasmask i used for halloween for that one year more often
That cannon needs a "On the mooooon" soundbite.
You just jelly that I'm a peg-sis
3 0_o
Umm yeah its called equallity
4what?
wow, it even took him to the moon
Mmmmmbananas?
She is not just busy, she is squiddly busy
I've heard "pegasister" rather than "peg-sis"
Equality doesn't lean towards bros.
I am toats hitting on this Fluttershy gel
I have heard of pegasis, but I would rather say pegasister.
REALLY? I knew there was a moon portal mod, I bet they took the moon part from that
brony originates from /b/
In all fairness Brony is generally not thought of in a postive light
07>mfw squidvade
Brony was using in /co/ before /b/
I never liked the term brony
silly
> conquer the chairs and tables
this anime is silly
...What?
This is the sound that show go with being mooned, the moon singing "You've been moooonnneed" like in this YouTube.

Lol, the translation I first watched of this took out all of her "squid" interjections
Twilight told me this video is about You Just Got Mooned!
4just like you did on Nightmare Moon
yay
There is no point it splitting up based on gender
Hey, Hasbro used it in Equestria Girls, so I don't think they believe it is a solely negative moniker
IMo
hey hey hey, just because I loved her until she randomly frenched me...
yes just like nightmare moon
4and kind of like Princess Molestia
Haha, oh wow this show
Shes not very smart..
Actually Molestia came onto me
anyone here watch regular show
?
3.........0_o

Bunch of baby ducks. Send them to the moon~
There's no need but I would still like to be allowed to.
Just to say, "I'm a hoeny for ponies."
3Wasn't me.
LOL hays
dat violin
4well then it must of been the vodka
4and the riot punch
so much effing squid
I honestly thought he would put snakes on his head or something
I goodness
Never enough squid
is this the episode I think it is?
Okay well I heard it was good and seen it on CN a little so I watched the first episode and it got away with saying "(characters name) is gonna be pissed" idk if thats like an uncut version or what
Haha I love that
Hay
lol i've never heard that
Yes. The show is actually PG so they swear a little.
4oh and also with MirthTinker Silvermane
Which surprised me.
They didn't "get away" with it. That's h9ow the show is.
Hmm I was just wondering cause I was like wait did he jsut say that?
"DOn't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches."
Silvermane left
bad news I cant find FLCL
What did you do DecapKing?
Oh, yet another series where I've only seen hentai and never actually watched the show...

Then again i'm glad to see CN breaking away from the PC bs that other kids channels suck up to
/me nods sagely.
Yesh, I know Thunder :p
lol kersha, i do somewhat
...?
but it is A rule of the internet. The 34th one :0
Yeah, it does seem to be having some identity now
he fixed the typo
crap I have my homewrok right here and I have done let me count...1 question

Though everyone has nostalgia for Toonami and that era
true
Oh should I show an anime that started as hentai first then?
internat
1 sec
where can i get mlp apperal?
THIS PART.
Spin: why u keep reminding me of my homework?
...
Never had Toonami
THe thing that gets me is... Regular Show has normal set up that turns into a brew of just bat-guano insanity.
Maybe I've already seen it, Sumica. ^_^
OH THIS PART.
I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING
(inb4 bible black)
ara ara

Under no circumstances are you to google what I just said

Higurashi is good. I only got to the third part within the first series, but I wish I could get back to it.

Silvermane, how goes the PLAN?
6DEM SOUNDS o^o

07Night Ziltoid
6Goodnight Ziltoid!
Night Ziltoid
Nichijou = my ordinary life.
i finished coraline today
Lex Luther stole 40 pies
it was a very short yet good read
i liked it
that's as much as four tens
Part of my schools new one you can choose english classes by genre like mine is Dark Days: Dystopian Enlgish
and that's terrible
Night Ziltoid
I have The Awakening to read... I feel like the lamest one here
night, Ziltoid
Interesting, it sounds like the J-Horror film Battle Royale
0Good night Ziltoid
lawl
i wish there were more steampunk books
0Oh!
WHAT
There's going to be a movie of it in 2012
!!!
What?
boom
I THINK I LIKE THIS SHOW.
So I get to read Farenhiet 451 .. again liek the 5th time
07WAT?!
what. in. the. fuck.
Darn, otherwise I'd tell you cheat, watch the movie. That's what I did, heh heh.
0Oh, wrong anime
I... What the hell's going on?
I read that. Ray Bradbury is crazy.
It's like something straight from Pinkie Pie's fanfic journal
Sci-fi writers are just... crazy
Awesome crazy
I know, it's a good kind
This show is made of random, much like me
/me 0is poker facing at the standard fare.
Guys... we write fanfics about Ponies, right?
4no, its terrible that this chat isnt as interesting as it could be
Well, what's freaky is when the stuff they've discussed becomes reality.
k?
dont go there herospirit
Do you think... Pinkie writes Bronystate fanfics?
6My train of mind goes SPLAT SPLAT
Herospirit. Fund it
6Trainswreck? :'D?
Like how Gattica was about genetic engineering, and now we're having to deal with the ethics involving genetic engineering now.
Its good but I've read so many times because I move alot and all my schools feel like they should give it to my grade so I should just take the test now
0herospirit: :0
Gattaca
brb food
6Look down, back up, the chat is now diamonds~
I have brought silence to the chat.
It's all letters from the genome
I read this one sci-fi novel, Dead Girls, and they used the anatomic names for body parts and bones to describe a love scene
/me is now diamonds. It is hard to breathe
And deep thought.
0Nu uh
Interesting, I guess
It was NOT romantic... in the least bit
lol
4is still the same earth pony from Stalliongrad he was before
0I have. Muahaha
I don't think you were their target market then.
I'm still here, I was just trying to make sense of this show
or of what I've seen, rather
What would Pinkie's Bronystate fanfics would be like?
0Silvermane
I can confirm what they would be like
Silvermane and every one else here
IT was young adult, but this scene... lemme copy it for you to see.
They would be all about the many possible ends Val will eventually meet
I don't want the mods to say you're going past PG
Lol
Razyn. what
0Silvermane getting laid, Ghosties getting hugged, SPAM TOOT ETC
...wrong Pinkie, Dashie
/me approves of this
Oh this was the lead up. Nothing bad in the part I am referring to
and DecapKing drinks vodka
What do you mean by that?
Okay
0Chekov's salmon
DID SOMEONE SAY TOOT?!
4Razyn, just what are you trying to say?
TOOT
Yep so far my favorite one has been the Giver
0TOOT
TOOT
TOOT
TOOT
Wait, that's what we do alread- OH MY GOD WE ARE IN A FANFIC
0TOOT
OTTO
TOOT
That was a good story, but creepy
exactly herospirit
0TOOT
STOP TOOT SPAM. WE ARE IN ONE OF PINKIE'S FANFICS.
Loading Tootspam.txt, firing at 20%
0Loli teacher
>_>
so lemme get this clear, we're talking about being in a fanfic while in a fanfic?
Her teeth scratched at my ear, and the thick pulse of her clockwork heart beat against my own. Her plasticky flesh warmed, grew tacky, its illusion of wantonness betrayed only by the rib-cage, hard as vat-grown steel, adhering to my solar plexus and imprinting its decal of black and blue. Breathless, I ran my hand down her hair, the crenellations of her spine, to settle upon her sacrum, the small trephination o
I don't know as an aspiring artist it made me think of my child hood
Ficception?
THE MLP FIM SHOW IS JUST AN AUTHOR SELF INSERTION
Fanfiception
0We are genre savvy
eeeeyup
/me is in a fanfic... and wrote fanfics in this fanfic...
/me also starred in those fanfics
OH MY GOD. WHAT DO WE DO NOW
They are not doing anything naughty. At all.
You know your doomed when Pinkie ties balloons to her body to get to you
0Pinkie Pie must be a master of inception
Yeah you see, I'm pretty sure that book was aimed at Goths and Emos
6XDD
Boring
6Breathe in diamonds~
4looks like you were wrong violet
All you need for a good story is sex and violence
what the HELL do we do now
and ponies
4as i still want some vodka
That's what I want to know
Everything we know is a lie
Maybe also for med students, I dunno
0I hate it when that happens
just ponies actually
I realy wanted to startle you all with inception horn but I just couldn't do it.
WAT
Hey
WAT
*thinks of the combination of sex,violence and ponies*... nevermind
Who was writing the Barley Stalk fic?
I am so confused right now
WAAAAt
oh my god @ dev version of Dead Island animations
WAT
/me thinks of Spin
mfw LYRA
/me is hurting from laughter
SHUT UP EQD, YOU'RE JUST AN AUTHOR SELF INSERTION
6What does vodka have to do with diamonds? o:
KershaFangs: So it's like MLP?
oh no the sushi
...kind of?
New post on Equestria Daily by Phoe: Comic: Lyra to the Stars (http://tinyurl.com/3skfez9)
Ya thats not my kind of book sounds like another one of those teen complex books never got into those.
0Dat comic
4diamonds cant drink vodka
Guys, if Elements of Gaming's description of Gears of War is anything to go by, I doubt I'll ever play it
OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD
4and i want some
0It touched my hear
6I have seen this before. . .
Like Ender's game, but stupid?
man, I go to check EQD for like, three seconds and get back to... I have no idea.
Well if MLP involved the battle with Nightmare Moon inside of Twilight's reproductive organs, yeah. Just like it.
.
wat
Geats of Wat is great
4so i am still the same Stalliongrad earthpony i was before
Gears of War*
So its basically the exact same?
wat wat
...reproductive organs?
lol, the host of Dark Matters said "First, here's a man who was not born a genius."
Lol, Geats of Wat.
do not want
And that's special how?
0It's like a female version of Cromartie
What is Dark Matters?
The final battle was inside of the main robot vampire's uterus. Which she gets sucked into by looking into her bellybutton.
It's a show on the Science Channel
Also, was it MrMooMoo who was writing the Barley Stalk fic?
who's using Mirth's name?!
About experiments that went too far or went wrong
I am not making this up. That's why I read this book. It's crazy.
Creepy stuff
What the fuck
JAN
KEN
I don't... I...
POOOOOOOOOOOON~~~~
Huh?
oh also, HAI HAI
Oh, Thunder, we found out that the world is a lie.
11Ohai RS
Hey
Ya I'll stick to Ayn Rand and ELie Weisel
What is this? I'm pretty confident that I don't even.
13Btw Violet
but yeah...somepony is using Mirth's name
4what?
Well, yeah, I know about that, I meant the stream :P
Elie Weisel, his books are great, but so sad
THe Wiesel is a cool guy.
I accidentally ALL the vampire uterus.
Now you've made me baww
Ooooh.
4hey person i dont know
13You couldnt ban me for such a ridiculous reason anyway, you would lose your job =P
You mean someone else registered it or something?
Is that dangerous?
11Where is Mirth?
no, just someone online with it
Okay, I'm done, sorry.
woo, Lyra stargazes as well =)
/me 8is back again and hugs Silvermane first this time. ^^
Ya but I kinda like dark books for some odd reason maybe its the emo in me
Where?
/me thinks Razyn is slow on the uptake
But I use ponies to counter that
-___(\
What.
Well it's fine, but with Elie Weisel that was real.
4hey Fluttershy
I love terrible stories and badly written/absolutely insane plots.
6I was just kidding Rainbow_Dash
"the emo in me"
I mean it's fine if it's fake
you do realize...why I would know if someone is using Mirth's name and she's not on right?
Ya I know

I had the whole Dead trilogy but lost my book. I was so sad... The second book starts off with a 15 comma long sentence. I knew it was going to be amazing
Huh. Not the one I was thinking of.

I think I ghosted into chat and didn't connect at first

KershaFangs: So it's like a series of unfortunate events series?

So guys, how can we affect Pinkie's fiction? Write our own story?

13Lol
0Loli teacher. Nervous fidgety loli teacher.
Why it make you mad Spin?
11Not sure why pink
6and I know, I would not do such a thing

Not bad

Kersha Fangs: I'll find the one I come in on
6I really hate my name...my parents came up with it
Spin-- he doesn't just DO music, he /composes/.

Fine Dash, I'll think of a ridiculous name for you instead
What I mean
/me do music. plot.

Hey guys. Is Sethisto around? I'd like to have a quick word if possible. :)
/me 4goes and sits up against a tree and hums "Under and Over it" by Five Finger Death Punch to himself while drinking some Colt One vodka
5I finally found somepony more depressing than me! oh wait...that's not a good thing
/me pulls the blanket out of hammer-space again. (AKA his saddlebags)
Music and I are bffs
Sounds ominous, but go for it..
/me makes an attempt to steal Octavia's bassello.
HI BACONCAT!!!

Hi Spin
Sup
Kersha: there is only a couple running gags... and the Widget Saga

Oh no lagging to death
"Wow I get really loud when I'm drunk."
o-o
/me drapes it over the tired Fluttershy. "Take a rest Shy-Shy. I'll be here if you need me."
Anyway, I'll go play gamse with me little bro
0Cromartie?
/me 8blinks slowly, and smiles tiredly. "Thank you."
Seth is almost NEVER on
And we've never let him forget it.
Bob.

Meh, Okay

Mai Be trollen again.

I like shotguns like my bro's 12 gauge or his friend's .207
kinda the point.
Yep, I remember ep 14.
So are they actual witches..?
The helpful part was he was a homestuck fan.
/me hugs Denied_Existence
Spin: He's randomly quoting from my show also Octavia: oh dear yea... it was pretty damn special

Even talked in troll text!
11Wassat? Didn't cathya?
6I don't drink strong liqour
/me hugs VioletVanilla back.
Thanks for clearing that up Cyril
15So MirthTinker, have you heard about our new disciple of shipping, Emerald? DE brought her in yesterday
Homestuck + Ponies = My life
/me sniffs some roses
5she's...kind of a lightweight
4you call vodka a strong liqour?
Lol
I've fired a ar-15, Type 56 SKS, Century Arms Galil, Desert Eagle .45, some 9 mm, and a lil' .22 pistol
13oh, no!
Pretty much at least.
13is she new?
But yeah, he had heard of ponies, but could never decide wether to see it or not.
but yea, my show... gets pretty depraved, but its usually pretty funny
/me peers of RoseLuck's shoulder."Thats poison ivy."
15She came in and made quite the show, as the logs bring me to believe
13wait, is she like Two-Bits and I?
I told him about ponychan and gave him a youtube link
And you were like BITCH GET OVER THERE AND WATCH PONIES, right?
he told me he would check it out.
15I do not believe so
Pretty much
Nichijou hurts my brain... =_=
no it's not
i enjoyed it, first one i got to hear all the way through live
it's poison joke
One of my friends knows about it cause I told him about it, but I don't think he's checked it out yet
11UWAAAAAAAAAAH! TELL ME SOMEONE RECORDED TRIXIE BOOMBOX?
4ill just say, it was interesting
Ah! Japanese pedo bear!

Why on earth was he playing on a Virtual Boy? is that why he needs those glasses?
hi rainbowinthesky
Those don't taste like cookies though.
/me hums 'My Selene'
11Smells like one too. Fresh, even!
I have fled the bunker. It was too calming. I become VIOLENT when I am too calm.
no escape from reality
open your eyes
/me 3kicks the landmine out of Razyn_the_Pony's hands! It flies out the window!
Not that song

My minds un-weaving
COMPLETELY RANDOM

Pinkie Pie's level

Too bad! :3
13yeah, we've discussed this before DE

15Dashite, Chicago is 4 hours highway from me
Rainbow Dash is boss
3Is this a trick question Dashite?
Well, Pony EPISODES are on fridays
like a boss
4its 3 hours by highway for me
Silvermane, but you aren't wearing sunglasses at night. At least, not that I am aware...
That's alright, it would wake up Fluttershy. It's pretty loud.
como un jeffe
I don't know the schedule yet ;~;
/me is insecure
:P Like a boss
A lot of streamers like to show PMV and the such in between episodes of shows they like
file fail, just a second.
15Dashite, I didn't put on any sunglasses.
Also, I feel too calm
3I have sunglasses Dashite
bawss
He's insecure like boss
baus
ONEE SAMA
13so Silvermane...I'm not sure I'm creative enough to roleplay a 2v1 threeway...probably
15In fact, I'm in Tinker's bedroom atm. Not sure why anymore
3BLACK PERSCRIPTION SUNGLASSES BOY
lolwut
4can we have some "Under and Over it" by Five Finger Death Punch then?
I think I need to punch something. Before I get violent.

15Oh right. That.
Wait, what?

Ten more days...
11You morons ran away my most trusted assistant.. >_<

13I think we need to get another rp'er if we want to do that, or choose somepony with an easier personality to emulate
!link season 2
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/48340
11...
13its hard to emulate Trixie in a personal manner, she's usually just really haughty and unlikable
I've been hit by a car two or three times, going at decent speeds, so for now I'm assuming I'm indestructible
11...!
15Nah, I'm fine DE. That's fine Tinkerbelle, as long as you don't toss me another 'and then they fucked' ending
Sunglasses at night + miles to chicago = no one thinks Blues Brothers? MFW :(
11He better prepare his Anus
13...
!s2
Season 2 begins in 9d:10h:15m:17s
Hey there, any... body here like to roleplay?
13yfw I was thinking that
wtf.
Umm... what?
3DEAL WITH IT
4what about "Powerless" by Chimaira?
WHY DID YOU INVITE ME SO MANY TIMES
3Sorry...that happens for some reason now...
11Glad you could make it back Herospirit
as whom?
haha idk if you want to with me
Also dammit they removed my sticky on /pony/

You didn't say anything though. :(
11Because, I knew you wouldnt return if I didnt
oh good, i will still be home to see the premiere

Possibly
I'm pretty bad at it
today i chatted with some stranger as pinkie
11I cant just let these morons run you off >.>
/me displays :0 on his LCD
3I don't know why...it has something to do with these glasses I am wearing...
BLARGLARGLALRG

What kind of thread was it, Baz?
11Lol
/me 8blinks. "Welcome back." ^^

But you should check out AD
and what happen?
We RP a lot
6I pulled out my boombox~
broken audio rulez
Ah I see it's trying to refrence a seprate file for the shows intro.

Oh?
:I
It was just a link to a Youtube with all episodes in 1080p
4sorry if i woke you up Fluttershy....
...? ...? ...*
/me 15whispers a suggestion into MirthTinker's ear. "How about I teach you about wings?"
There is also #BucketofHolding
ended up in a basement to "make" cupcakes
attourney dash
/me 3takes a sip from the flask.
/me glomps Fluttershy.
It took me ages to find one so I figured I'd post it for others
Denied_Existence http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqxnrfId8t1qfc8ayo1_400.gif
What in the hay is goin on?

6MASS RP TIME

4DE, if you think thats odd im wearing a gas mask
/me is glomped, squeaks. o-o
and the two serious ones
...!? ...*
3Good for you.
8It's okay... ^^
Also the sticky with a download of all the episodes is down
11Uhoh.. Maybe we should run away Herospirit
#EquestriaDailyRP and #Steamyponies
OBJECTION
But they just put that back up as a sticky...
HOLD IT!
does any1 knows if netflix has the hub?
Hrm.
And they raaaan. They ran so far awaaaay
/me squeaks. :3
the vido is set to reference separate files for opening and ending tracks. VlC dosent know how to do that so it derps out.
SWEET.
dont link steamy ponies here D=
I suggest you hold yourself from clicking steamyponies
I don't think so
/me can't resist Fluttershy cuteness and hugs her
3Your coolness level has increased by 15%
Hey, that anime i need to finish still
8o-o I have a new glompee in the BronyState tab...
4mainly cause there was some type of neurotoxin leak
4AW FUCK YEAH
13but I'm not a pegasus...
=3
no hub on netflix
So have some epic
darn
i can't stop listining to Q&Neigh, I want MOAR
or hulu
4Now THIS is an anime
:I
/me is now curious
/me rescues Fluttershy from glomp-fest
Hey, I was hugging her first!
what is this?
*click8 why/
Let's fight... like gentlemen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du3bkXYpOEc&feature=related
I've only tried Hulu
0Cowboy Bebop?
* *click*
4It's Cowboy Bebop, man
Cowboy Bebop
13and that spell is really hard
/me is hugged by Applejack, blinks, then is rescued by Silvermane e-e oh dear
0Yep
and then suddenly
4i would never glomp you Fluttershy
4One of the most awesome, bad ass animes ever conceived
0I could tell. I dunno how.
/me 13covers mouth at sudden innuendo
its just that its starting here this week, and was wondering wether to hire it or not
8o-o Alright. That's good to hear
11...
I'm not obsessed or anything
Epic intro is epic
I should hide before one of the mods hurt me
sorry...i didn't have a good childhood
if it had ponies it wouldnt be a hard choice
3*Bum bum, tisch*
/me starts crying
6Am I wrong for knowing this on all of my instruments? o:
Razyn seems to be having trouble speaking.
/me hugs VioletVanilla
It's okay Applejack, i'm sorry
/me hugs Applejack
12Reticent, I think they forgot about us
/me hugs Applejack. "No tears"
umm ya just was in Steamyponies...
/me cries even harder cuz of english mispellin
/me hugs Natleyn back. c:
4i didnt
/me 5nods "probably"
so us singing Bohemian Rhapsody earlier made me think of the Muppets version of the song...
11We always forget about Reticent. He's reticent.
/me feels a bit better
is there a PS3 bronies?
<=3
/me walks up to Fluttershy
4i truly stopped caring as i am apathetic
/me 3glomps MourningStar! "OH WHY WOULD I FORGET ABOUT YOU!?"
are*
11By nature that happens
...which in turn made me want a Pony version of the song, in the same way as the Muppets singing it
>.> She seemed to like it earlier
4It's ok AJ. I know how conflicted you were with being raised on a farm and wanting a city life
And I will try to confugure YT at some point to work with my streaming. need to set up a play list or something so I am not having to search on stream.
So how ya doing?
/me looks at BrokenWind, blinks. "Yes?"
should of thought what "steamy" meant
not just a PMV
:,C
/me 15ignores innuendo
Is this... a Film Noir anime?
Spin, eeyup.
/me smiles. "Oh. Very good thank you." ^^
/me 15considers this situation
i´ll watch it
5she's mai waifu and you can't have her! *goes off to make a pony image of her to gloat*
I always assumed it was a steamroom. I HATE moister
Film Noir styled :0
so I'll never go there
/me 15pulls a scroll out of hammer-space
*moisture
6It is a freaking good anime is what it is <3
8I like it alright. But too much is... too much >_<
4It has some film noir
15Did you know I had hammer-space, MirthTinker?
3SILVERMANE USED INGNORE, ITS SUPER EFFECTIVE
Eh?
4But it's mostly just a bad ass show
4yeah, but im an earth pony, not a pegasus
blums, is the sky still weird?
/me smiles back. "Have seen you since you fell out of fight school."
which reminded me of the fact that the glee version is more popular on Spotify
Well I saw steam and thought TF2
/me dumps a whole water-tower on top of Blums*
yes
Spacerings
Film Noir and badass are nearly synonyms
I can only think of two animes about cowboys and space... this and Trigun.]
6XD DecapKing. . .
I hate moisture too, it causes my books to get all.... wavy
0"I just move like water"
its blue and dusky-ora-
13is there hammer space-time? does it operate on the principles of groovatility?
I like moisture
3Sorry, that happens too...
It keeps me nice and cool
/me 0is bad with quotes
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
True. I'm pretty light on my hooves, not to mention I can prevent ground collisions.
Thank you!!
/me glomps mexican
I like water not moisture I hate humidity
/me pauses, tilts her head. "I... I don't recognize you, I'm sorry..."
/me hears dub
/me stands stiff, wide eyed, blinking rapidly
/me jumps in the Equestriadaily pool
/me does not know how to react
we have a pool?
since WHEN??
Spin, if you have a mental filter, the normal rp is good. i ignore the rest.
We do now apparently
/me 8falls over onto her back with a squeak. e.e
at first i thought this was Samurai Champloo, that guy looked like Mugen
4Wut
/me shakes all the water off
Dub isn't THAT bad
Since nome
4Are you kidding...this dub is excellent
nome?
Guys, when someone discriminates Bronies, we need to do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxVEkb69AGQ&feature=related
4that cant be good
*jumps into the pool too*
0It is
one of the better dubs
there's not place like nome?
6Samurai Champloo is made by the same people who did this.
/me 15hands MirthTinker the scroll. "Single use, and it should give you the /desired/ results"
Rolf: Have you brought the cupcakes of sorryness?
Yes
/me stands still for a few seconds in the pool, looks around nervously and slowly swims away.
>cupcakes
Its got a Jacuzi that pours, "Into" the pool
6I was actually saying. . . I like this dub. . .
Bell Peppers and... Bell Peppers
The other RPs are non serious
that explains, Thanks yall kahdly, sugarcube
Maybe we don't have brains
It's okay. I never really said 'Hi' to you.
but we have fun
/me sits relaxing in the jacuzi*
6Spike's voice <3
4I actually wanted to try bell pepper and beef after watching this
and that's what RPing is about
or something
doesn't help first line I see is THAT
y is the pool warmer now?
because of the jacusi
wait...why dat "Cowboy" on the title?
Ghosties. It is full of ugh
/me 3watches with amusement.
*jacuzi
8I... I'm fine... just scared myself... ^^;
I dropped a depth charge into it
It's great,Ghosties has to be stur fri though
/me relaxes next to CogWEaver
Hey
Spin, honestly, i would just not go there because you will see a lot of /that/
dont worry, i made sure nopony would get hurt
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
CogWeaver*
/me 4just sits there, drinking his vodka
stuffed bell peppers are really yummy
6I would make you some Ghosties~
Well I'll sit here and just chill in the pool
this anime doesn't have ANY Cowboys....
4Aw, thanks Violet :3
Hey that reminds me, I should continue that fic!
/me 11wonders what is wrong with his friends
/me gets up out of the Jacuzi*
i dislike the Rping in pony tumblrs, alwas seems... angry
And once we get the anti-brony love and tolerated the crap out of:
nope.avi
4AJ, you're in for a surprise
6n.n
Is this the first episode?
cowboy = bounty hunter.
/me sighs. "Oh okay. Don't worry me like that. No becoming a tree via alternate routes now."
I want more clips
yes
"THE TRIBE OF MY FELLOW BRONIES HAS BEEN AVENGED! Thanks for all the ponies."
brb
4well im an alcoholic
!moon
Grab my tail, mexican!
awww
4Yeah
4First ep
Spin, giving some insight. do what you will, just be respectful.
0I always wondered, if they are so broke, how can they afford the resources for this stuff?
15Razyn, many things
That is not nice!
Alright
13yfw you've used the basic plot for every futa hentai out there
4Good first ep at that
Magic
/me has the entire soundtrack of this.
8I suppose that wouldn't be very good, true... though sometime in the future I would like to be a tree, at least for a bit... -blushes-
^second
/me is surprised
/me 4has this show on DCD
4*DVD
Mongoose... do you own a Mongoose... "Bike"
Razyn, same way a broke guy can afford to drive a car and have internet
/me does as well~
No
3MFW Emerald likes to RP with me more than anything, yet is only my friend IRL..
heh
I don't own a bike
/me 11can attest to what Mirth said
My username is based off the animal
Any one getting lag spikes?
Ya people have their preferences I am all tolerance and the like
4Great, now I want tomato juice
Spin
The AD RP is full of sex and violence
15MirthTinker... *shudder*
15Also, it will give you wings
the #PonyRp is not
Fluttershy: Anyways, I go by "BrokenWind"
0No lag
any new news on this Discord pony, or it still hush hush
It's more for beginning Rpers
egh
I really like carrot juice
o-o
yes, Dee
and I have no clue about the #BucketofHolding
he's not a pony
0Dem boobies
4wings seem to be over rated
/me 3wonders how Silvermane knew about his Red Bull stash...
Kick Natleyn and Natleyn2, please? Chrome crashed. Twice
hmmm
he's male
Bucketof holding?
I'm everything.
BrokenWind: Oh. ^^ Okay. I'll remember that.

Ninja cowboys...? Oh dear...

(Gotta go need to make dinner cya.)
4Keep watching AJ

/me is melting at Spike's voice
/me coughs violently
6Correction AJ, Mugen looks like Spike
/me 11is watching how Silvermane seems to be quickly finding herself a new RP partner
I need a picture of that guy wearing a FLuttershy shirt with the captions: MANLY

/me 15unravels the transfiguration scroll in front of MirthTinker
Kirby :3
11Why, D_E?
3(My OC i mean)
Come on, don't be nervous. I'm perfectly harmless... unless you don't want me to be ;)
that's not very neighbor of you
3(Hes drawing it, told me to bug him EVERYDAY)
(damn kissy wink face)
12also...I think Reticent has a thing for unicorn fillies
i need safari hat... to ebay!
5I d-do not!
So many RP channesl at once too many
15Heh, at least he has good reason, seeing as he IS one
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
5I'M NOT A FILLY
15I'm a pegasus, and yet all i go for are unicorns and griffons
4i dont like fillies that can levitate me with ease, its just unnerving for me
/me 3facehoofs.
I only use two
11Reticent has a thing for unicorn fillies!? That works so well!
and one is not even a real RP
5NOT LISTENING LALALALALA
/me 15facehoofs. "YOu are a unicorn i mean"
Going to refresh stream again after this ep.
Mind = blown. I think one of my FB friends is a closest brony, but something's nagging in my mind that he isn't.
3DecapKing Oh, i think you LOVE fillies who can "Levitate" you.
'kay.
*facebook
/me 12giggles dryly
What makes it do that?
;]
;D
3Yes, Emy proved that quite well.
nope.
; and )
Currently reading a flier while people in bucket try to talk to me and stuff is going on in the steamy ooc
;)
4that she did
Ah.
6I love these old guys. . .
/me 4drinks some vodka
13she....she's no fun
Nopony I know is a brony
:)
rp can lead to large amounts of windows, lost sleep, and carpel tunnel
Now I know
5C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
^
4I do too
Did he just say....
Haha, old people.
8brb doing something important real quick
Yah.
15I think I like fillies that can over power me
Yeah, he did.
4This reminds me so much of Clint
and anger
5so you like earth ponies like AJ?
heardmind Ghosties
ShadTheCrazed: Care to go on?
15Unicorns with their magic, earth ponies with strength, griffons in general...
* Joins: GreatAndAllPowerful
6Do you know how much YOU are worth?? :D?
ohai Violet
Plorf: I dunno. Should I ask him if he's a Brony?
He DOES look ridiculous
hahaha
3And pegasi?
you found mah bunker >_>
4im not a fan of being with griffions, the last one i dated is still stalking me....
. . . Is there something I should know?
o:
15although I like having an easy job guessing the weak point, so unicorns are preferred.
I mean, unless you don't know him very well
why not
13so...you'd like me less if I were a pegasi? *sniff*
/me 3is a pegasus, and is quite annoyed at this.
He's at my school, just not in my classes.
nah. We made this the other day when all the pouncing was going on... and never really left.
FWAP
6Oh 'tay~ :3
Just ask him "Who is best pony?" you'll find out fast enough
15MirthTinker, it just wouldn't be as interesting if you were a pegasus. Of course, then you'd know ALL about how to control me via wings
How I think I know is because of this:
Hey everyone, I'm just wondering, what is this weekend's movies?
We really need some batman sound cues up in here
Spin: GOOD IDEA!
so, they are selling it.
/me 11is a unicorn and is still wondering why everypony here is crazy
I just noticed someone had joined the channel is all
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rainbow-Pegasus-Pony-Mascot-Costume-/110740955959?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item19c8ace337#ht_1110wt_1270
15which is why I want to give you an education
6Though. . . If you do not like the pouncing you can say so. . I do not want somepony to be upset at me. . .
wut
Unless I'm the only one watching the stream. :[

I've heard of Rocky Horror but only seen a little bit of it
hopefully whoever buys it uses it for awesome purposes
You've... never heard of Rocky Horror? :0
15MirthTinker, it trades the horn out for wings, but only for a few hours
6'Tay~ Just making sure. I will leave ^^;
3Only the box knows what is inside.
haven't seen any of it.
I love the blatant avoidal of anything saying it's Rainbow Dash
That's honestly a decent costume. Wow 700

Totally not what I expected to be streaming...
Gummy Hat

/me 15watches the magic flow around his filly, granting her a beautiful pair of feathered wings, stealing her horn in the process.
/me 13puff of smoke, light, magic, fireworks, orchestra, balloons, choose what you like of the aboce
Hiya Dashite.
I'm only here for another... 45 minuets, about?

Lego' my Eggo'
alfalfa monster ... 7c7
It's like Captain Planet is raping my retinas
/me 4worries about the possibility that Mirth would look for a way to become an alicorn after the spell wears off
/me 3mentally notes this confusion for his Psychology notes.
Exactly.
wait this scares you after what we have watched so far?
0Flutterwhat, it's a movie. Not just this video
/me 15kisses the panicking mare. "Shh, education time silly filly. It'll wear off in two hours."
Octavia is the alfalfa monster
rarity makes a similar pose in look before you sleep
13I, can't feel my magic! THE MAGIC IS GONE
Ok I'm torn between the "This Shirt just got 20% cooler" or "Brony"
Sumica, you would be surprised what things scare me
or whatever that episode is called
so does pinkie pie and twilight
so it seems
/me is feeling very VERY tired, so she's goin to sleep(otherwise...you know) See Yall later =3

Ok, so not pulling large files from archive drive, gotit.
15anyways, MirthTinker, come here. Since you seem using my wings against me, I though I'd show you what, how, and why
4you try having an insane griffon stalk you for 5 years and not be paranoid
/me 13glares at him
Why is this whole movie in trippy 60's Technicolor
I blow up buildings too.... in sim city
I worship allah
Not sure if like

i hate
daft punk's videos
15I did no such thing
Nothing
0herospirit is complaining about something? :0
13how do I know you aren't going to take advantage of me again?
herospirit is awesome.
Alright then
Sounds like he needs hugs.
Is that shocking?
Mongoose if I said, time free booze, you'd say?
like the cat
15What lie did I tell?
/me hugs herospirit
4want me to beat his plot for you Mirth?
"I'm bombing really bad this time" "no not that kind"
Hug him!

/me 15rolls his eyes. "She always does."

15In the mean time...
I like this song. :0
I think I'm gong to decide on... The 20% cooler shirt...
0Harder better faster stronger
and the drinking deck cards >:3
4but i could beat him right now, and it would give me a purpose to do something right now....
this song is the most overplayed POS in the entirety of space and time
I've heard it repeatedly too often during long car trips. Otherwise, I like it.
But this movie is freaking me the FUCK out.
The most? Not even close...
4besides kill my liver
/me 15places a hoof in the crook between Tink's wings, placing pressure. He knows this most typically causes the knees to give out slowly, depending on the willpower of the pegasus in question
Kanye west's INSTERMENAL made it a bit better
]hate his lyrics
/)^3^(\ <--- Smooshy face for all of you. XD
I don't mind it, but it's not my favorite
ok
/me 13feels...nothing
maybe not the most
but i dislike this song
13um Silver...what are you doing?
Oh thats what that emote means....

The Kanye instrumental was cool. The lyrics ruined it

Hmm this is awkward... I can't remember my shirt size xD

AERTH NEEDS GOOD BANDS
EARTH NEEDS GOOD BANDS
Yea?
bingo well part right h
Very
You calling me fat?
3I....think you fucked.....up...that spell....
I said smooshy face because that's how Bronyville are referring to it in their podcast.
and then find ways to make it shrink if it's too large
4i would agree
/me 3twitches
is that the first doctor?
well they're wrong, Mason
it's obviously the Dash face
obviously
Let's see I'm 5'10'', 155 lbs
4i wonder if this would help....
15DecapKing, means someone feels something because they feel sympathy for another in some way. like leg pain when someone breaks their leg
lol kind looks like em
13but what if I just haven't opened up the nerves in my wings? I mean, they didn't exist just a few minutes ago, what if its a delayed reaction to the magic?
I'm really lanky
lol

Wow, can't unsee now. xD

3Ouch...
Close Enough *brohoof*

This movie is drugs
3Yeah...

/me 15clips a leather binding to the wing joints of MirthTinker, both connected to chains
For a second I thought I was taller than you Mongoose.
Finally home.
G'night
But I don't know if it is drugs in a good way.

I'm just fatter than you
Or the pony's den. :p

4way to colt the fuck up DE
Then I realized, Keyframe sucks at math.
15of course, but you will stop moving quickly
^<4
Ah
Sumica is frying my brains, and I complained about something in here for the first time EVAR.
let the bobing of the head begin!
It's probably Mongoose's fault.
13*trots forward, gets tugged back by her wings*
13FREAKY!
so you are taller than him, Keyframe
/me 3splashes some Vodka into DecapKing's eyes.
just sideways
Speaking of which, I haven't seen Mongoose around here for a while.
15Eeyup.
4thanks
3Welcome.
4i actually needed that
I have a gut, but nebraska gave me beefy arms
3....
0Aye captain!
/me 15unhooks MirthTinker. "Roll onto your back, this one's a little more... involved.
I've been chatting in AD
!seen Mongoose
CogWeaver: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Mongoose is in the channel.
So I'm relatively slim
hrm
I think DerpyBot's broken
i'm steadily loosing weight, in the form of Bicycling and refusing the Easy way out by getting lifts
But I have been on here
13wait...Silver, why do you happen to have leather binding equipment for wings on hand?
13HOOF DAMNIT
Well this is sort of a trial run for my streaming capability too.
because she thinks Mongoose is here when he's obviously not
13I MEANT HOOD

15Don't worry about it
My body consists of gum its not fut or anything just kinda squishy and there
13HOOF
13SJUTUP
CogWeaver, you're kidding, right?
Of course
4because he is an odd pony
0Pretty good!
/me 3retrieves his anatomy books from his saddlebags.
15shhh silly filly
3Hmm...
If you have all had enough I can move on to something else.
I think I'm gonna go to bed, night night fellow ponies
I missed his last line :3
Admit it Sumica, you just want to fry my brains :p
3I don't remember reading about this...
That was only a nice bonus.
will make sure to put larger files on the primary drive
/me stretches, waves good night and leaves out the door and heads home
4Silver, did you just call me a "silly filly"?
13Silly, there's no wings on my belly
0Well, it's like two against twenty, so...
15course not. it's not something that is written down. like the old rule of 'control the head, control the body'
You caught me herospirit
aww
:)
0Or 7 if you're only counting the active ones
15MirthTinker, I know. Just lie on your back, wings spread
Beat you to it, CogWeaver...
/me 3takes out a pen and scribble this into the book.
whoop whoop~!
you also put the carrot on the name when I didn't
3D pan effect!
13...*does so* I feel like this makes me dirty :P
what? 2 against twenty for what?
Correct.
You guys both lose
He alreadly left
"I've got a golden ticket!"
vote to skip so to speak.
/me puts a carrot in Mongoose's eye*
LEFT! LEFT! LEFT RIGHT LEFT!
already*
4maybe its because im here?
/me whistles
/me 3notes this in his psychology notes.
Whoa what
Hayfever

/me has a carrot in his eye

I've got a golden tickeet in my eyeeee!
LEFT?
Gotcha. I don't overly care
So................ Good news..... I finished my fanfic... I don't know why but 3000 words was tough on me
/me 15blushes slightly. "Well it is an interesting angle... but I promised demonstration only for now
Right hoof?
0ALL THROUGH THE AIR
I really should get back to writing fics...
ALL THOUGH THE AIR
3000 words is a fair amount, if tightly written
Probabaly because you wrote it in twenty minutes?
hrm
My brains have melted several times, and they mostly reform each time
I am like a third complete with mine.
Then I decided f this I'm just going to animate it
13Well, demonstrate away, not like I'm going anywhere without half my back
heh
DYNAMIC ENTRANCE!
I don't really care either, but I'm curious as to how this ends now, haha.
"one more time" THATS WHAT YOU SAID LAST TIME
...animate it?
So now you'll all see my horrible Flash skills!
EW NO!@
:)
/me tickles HotCocoa.
Lyra: Ew, Flash
I'm still writing my fic
EW GA--I mean..um
/me snuggles Hayfever
I wont get to see how it ends. :I
Haven't seen you in a while.
/me 15straddles MirthTinker across the midriff. "Watch carefully." He slides forward, leaning his hindlegs on her wings near the joint carefully
:P
/me snuggles hayfries
Only have like 20 more minuets.
so would that make them the Blue man group?
SKY DIVE!
Hay, hayfries.
15The wings are very important to a pegasus
4what the hell am i watching?
I haven't seen you in my tummy.
freefall!
If I had 3D models.... That were rigged. I would be using maya... but noOOooOOo... I have to draw.
/me was feeling tiny and donkey. What?
wait what o.O
/me ohm nom nom nom.
15So the body will resist any attempt to move that may hard the wings
So far this has gotten better as it's gone, sooooo
S'cool.
If they made background ponies similer to the Fanon characteristics, would you watch it more frequently?
Like I said earlier, what I'm getting out of this is "Avatar: Daft Punk Edition", so... yeah
15right now, your wings are pinned down. This makes it impossible to sit up
MONGOOSE
there are 3d models that are rigged
KEYFRAME
ownage by new blue dude
They would only be there for like 2 seconds.
COGWEAVER
How could they be more like fanon?
MONGOOSE SCOTT
GUMMY.
New blue dude = best blue dude
GREAT MONGOOSE
From now on we will call him "Best Blue Dude"
/me IS SOON GOING TO BE YELLED AT
no
GUMMY USED GUM! IT'S SUPER-EFFECTIVE!
I haven't looked hard hayfever. I found models. But I'm Really picky about rigs
Gotcha.
ha, everybody is like: "what in the world just happened..."
just told to stop using caps
okay
13...you better not get that close to my face with your colthood when I'm so bound and bothered
now
Well, that works for me, considering that this movie doesn't even have any dialogue in it! XD
4i am so confused by this
ok
"Stop using caps, Mongoose"
15... umm...
4but oddly interested...
Darn, I was late.
Keyframe, kpsquirrelsomethingsomething on da has mostof the 3d models and they are very pro
...Left
heyo!
haah
Or... your "now" was early, CogWeaver.
The Black man who used to be a blue man is named "Afro"
LOL!
truck is just fine
night flutter
Night?
<3
*nice
I think I downloaded from Squirrel... They were just the models.
lolol
keyboard fail
What Coggy says goes
:P <3
/me 15quickly gets up. "Remember to do that pin lightly, as it cuts off blood flow if you go too heavilly. Nerve damage may result if you go down to rough
I didn't see a skeleton or handles anywhere

13but, you /are/ the expert here
u guise are besets friends
jk
Yeah, but his "now" prediction skills suck.
but i like everything you say
Cogsworth
Oh... or that.
LOL @ THE GUARDS!
Hahaha the security guys are robots?
actually, I'm not secretly a timetraveler
for maya? you have to turn on the boning
THE GUARDS ARE ALL TERMINATORS
I'm secretly a time-colonist
FASHIONABLE
Seen the new VGCats?
but SHH!!
Colgate has perfect timing
<3
D:
You're revealed as a time traveler?
works fantastic in blender
yea, we just got like. ran over by a damn truck. yet we look like we got sunburned...
13that pin seems almost mean
I have not, Tiger
No longer secret?
i havne't read VGcats for YEARS
yeah Nittany_Tiger
All this advanced tech and all they do is kidnap an alien band?
3It IS mean.
You mean "Show bones"
/me is secretly a time-colonist*
/me does not know maya well, prefers 3dsm or blender.
According to Mongoose
I don't have blender
I am a time traveler
4want me to break his jaw MirthTinker?
huminahumina
3Us pegasi value our wings highly.
15It's intended to completely dominate the physical self. Useful for taking control in romantic situations and combat encounters alike
Mongoose lies, though.
but Mongoose has been known to lie
I time traveled once.
Called it.
Can a blender blend itself?
So I'm not sure if I beleive hi m

Scott threw another pony reference. Seems to be a regular thing. I don't think the reference fits the comic.
him*
/me 3fluffs his wing.
/me 3fluffs the other wing too.
unless he draws ponies I'm not intrested
lol
0inb4 dat cameo
15Speaking of... Stand up now, carefully. Your blood may have pooled slightly.
well
i am
Yeah, I read it, didn't really seem right to me either
but he should draw ponies
going to their site now lol
So I'll look back into it. But the animation that I plan on doing is with OC characters... including the... Rule 63? The opposite gender of the main cast.
Need moar Lyra_as_Bugs_Bunny comics.
That would be cool.
!link Lyra_as_Bugs_Bunny
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
A pony side comic. He already does one for Pokemon.
See?

So grab a chick (a la, Rainbow Dash Iron Pony) and double-click.
sounds like porno music.

ohhhyeaahhhhhhhh
but...CORN! there's nothing better than it! ....except for pie...and of course pancakes...
15If you ever find bloodflow is lost, rubbing a wing brings it back quickly
Doesn't look invincible to me...
Hiya, everypony!
there's NOTHING like pancakes
Eggs

from what it looked like anyways.
/me 15places a hoof back in the crook between her wings, then traces it along the feather-support bone to her wing tip
Alright.
Trippy as all fuck
He did. Just not enough.
Ah.
What the hell bro?
15That should feel akin to electricity in a good way
My own Phoenetic spelling for words uses Capital vowels and lowercase for soft-vowels.

Hey VioletVanilla
Doesn't Best Blue Guy realize his love interest isn't nearly cool enough to be his love interest?
I apparently have a cough.
15I just said he looked bored. Could have played a board game with him
/me 3pushes DecapKing towards Polarfire.
"Hand me them TOR TILLA chips"
Zelda crystal thing o.O
Darn it.
/me 4hits Denied_Existence in the ribs again

da magics
/me pulls out a pistol and shoots Decapking in the gut
15Heh, yes. Fortunately for you I'm going gentle. The wingtip is extremely sensitive to stimulation, and personally i get a little brain dead if the support bone is rubbed to firmly. It's because it is all wired directly to the spinal column.
6OH Dashie, I would so make you some food. . . ;A;
his corpse is in the back of the car...lol they would be screwed if a cop pulled them over...
no problem
3......
Wat now beeeyetch.
3It appears you have been shot.
So why are grown-ups fascinated with the southern accent of the cowboy-hat-wearing pony Applejack, or lines like, “Are you sure about this, Scootaloo?”

I enjoy TOR TILLA chips
I loled at their line choice.
4well aint that a bitch
he's blue
RIP Best Blue Guy
so
I'll just have to make something up myself.
13but isn't the tip just feathers?
they would have worse to deal with then the police
3Good thing I am a medic...oh wait...you stabbed me in my operating foot....
People like southern accents, that's one of the reasons Bunny Rabbot is so popular in the Sonic fandom.

Exorcism via flowers.
Twilight
15It's actually a nerve ending with very pliable bones underneath. The feathers there are sensitive to wind currents, and help us fly quite a bit.
HA! nice hero

Best Blue Guy = Blues

herospirit; Suddenly... it all becomes clear
:P
I AM NOT STALKING TWILIoh you weren't talking about me.

Oki gonna go get me some panda express, will be back in a few.
Strangely enough, I actually got into the fandom because I was curious of a friendship is magic tag on a picture of BonBon I found.
it means you can talk like us mods when the room gets +m'd
o i c
0I want some~
It means you can speak while the ro~ nevermind
How much longer is this movie?
lol
like so:
I don't have much time before I have to sleep. :0
/me 15lightly lifts a large feather from her wing, careful not to bend it too far. "That's okay, we can try that later. This feather her is a pinion feather. They are heavily connected to the wing, so pressure on them is very noticable."
now everyone who isn't a mod or isn't voiced can't speak
:P
15-20min
creepy snowy mountain place
oh my
Is this music from Castlevania or something? It sure sounds like it, IMO
Plenty of time to go get some food.
I can speak
Of course, I probably can't tell you how she was portrayed in the picture since the chat is rated PG
Oh
Never mind.
what good is a keyboard, if you are unable to speak...?
4dont worry, it would take a while for me to bleed out from this
Will pick back up when I get back.
/me 15moves his hoof to a large patch of smaller, softer feathers. "These are down feathers. Very soft, good for a spot of warmth, and a good massage point if you want to make somepony relax.
I love it when this room is in m+!
Lyra and BonBon = best shipping. DJPon3 and Octavia = second best.
So much for editing cursors tonight.
13I'm not sure what you mean by all that, but it feels floppy
xD
I think Blues is now my favorite background Pony
What about Lyra and Octavia? x:
but really useful, I imagine, if a mod has an announcement to make or something
Spent all my time watching this.
its amnesia all over again!
3Also they are good for...nevermind...
4bow chicka wow wow
13I thought you can't feel feathers?
or when the chatroom is full of spam
She's my ROOMMATE.
yeah, or if the room starts going idiotic or starts moving too fast
Geeze.
It's more for traffic control.
I hope Blues appears more in S2, even before knowing he was BBG he was cool
Octavia and Scratch are amusing cause they are quite different yet somehow put together.
13or is it that you feel the feather's moving in place?
which drives me away from Daily
4can you feel your mane?
I'm pretty sure Lyra and I have never been stuffed into a crate before
/me does her slouchsit next to BonBon.
Myself, I kind of like Derpy and Dr. Whooves
15The feathers themselves, no. But where they connect to the wing is full of nerves
we all have a bit of Derpy inside of us all, though, don't we?
I know right, thunder?
bbg = big blue guy?
But even if we were..."shipped"...I think we all know who wears the pants in this barn.
15We don't regrow feathers, so bloodflow and nerves are very well connected to them.
Best Blue Guyy
/me is sitting next to Lyra. though for some reason she feels as if she should have white hair
Best blue guy
6_9 derp
I want a library like that. :(
O.O AMNESIA! RUN FROM THE ZOMBLES!
15Also, never EVER pull on a feather by itself. It would be at best, very painful, and at worst, traumatizing.
0Beware the druids

Season 2 begins in 9d:09h:05m:00s

6Amnesia is a wonderful game. . .
Lyra, your perfect the way you are <3
Who is now a reference only we 10 current active users will understand :P
YAY!!!
I once found a picture where Lyra and BonBon were re-enacting the infamous chocolate pudding scene from Rugrats.
What exactly does that mean Lyra?
4kind of like losing a hoof?
Hah, yeah xD
3Sortakinda
13wait, we don't regrow them? but I thought birds can regrow feathers and molt them all the time!
/me highfives the active people in #bronystate
15heh, I suppose, although you don't typically lose baby hoofs
HE MADE BETTHOVEN?!

/me 4shudders at the thought
So wait... that old man has been kidnapping alien musicians just because he wants awards?
From now on Blues is BBG, which will be confusing to other Bronystate users. :p

0Hells yeah
hahaha what the hell is going on
One hell of a childhood
Ponies are jelly that pants look best on Lyra
so when Lyra gets poison-joke'd, does she turn into a human?
NO
STOP THAT
STOP THAT DOCTOR
Makes perfect sense to me... Apart from the part where it doesn't, which is like... All of it
15Oh, the underwing is pretty ticklish. *Runs a hoof under her wing near the bottom*
WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG
