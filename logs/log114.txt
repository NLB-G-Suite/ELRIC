Americans don't have a word for flapjacks.
Linky!
That is a flapjack.

Hey everypony.

Yes. Sorry to disappoint you
Ooohh... it looks yummy. :3

Well I knew flapjacks and pancakes weren't the same thing, but I've never had flapjacks. I've had crepes though
=w=;

Those aren't flapjacks in the UK sense.

You didn't specify a cultural context.
Therefore you are wrong.
but kicking is fun and educational!
No.
Yup
It's called inference.
Use some.
I'm English.
Stop nicklalerting me.

The context being you asked Americans.

The context being I use UK English words.
Not American words.

Okay screw it
I hate feeling left out

If I ask anyone I can say they're wrong.
I do like fun
:o

You didn't get the answer I was looking for - wrong.
well you can SAY that
same words different definitions.
6but I did get it right. . . ;A;
What's an aubergine?
/me feels accepted as an individual by Dari for getting it right
cat a train
lol

You got the wrong answer.
It's a plant.
FLooding
I don't care whether you think it's right or not.

it's not like you'd be disrupting a busy channel, DaRe-DeViL
Only because you didn't specify which version you were talking about.
Look at the most recent post
lol
no one really cares
yeah
its just a chatroom
"Seems like everypony is getting sick lately"
D=
Wha? Whats this>
o.o
He wrote more lyrics? Thats ingenious.
Lemon_Lime: yeah
I know, yet I don't care :P
3rd verse = Applejack's bucked-up recipie
Hence "baked bads"
I told you, it's a plant.
/me smahes her phone. Work, stupid.
Okay the stream is really, really shitty on my end
oh, not just me, then
But specifically.
Eggplant.
Yes, it's a bit stuttery here.
No, it keeps cracking and breaking up
http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
And I've never heard the second term.
WoOOw
6Argy-bargy? as in a verbal dispute Dari?
this is really sad
:D
Derail fail VV =p
Oh no.
Pinkie you gotta stand up tall!
best part
omg omg
/me dances.
haaaaaaa
Yeah VV.
BEST PART EVERS
critical hit!
yet you don't ever get one :(
6How did I derail fail? D:
Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh
lol

<3
Yeah as in you got it right.
wtf is going on in here
well that was... interesting
How about clingfilm?
Trying agian.
again
Seemed like you tryed to chage the topic VV
Saran wrap or equivalent I assume.
we have bpom enabled now
*^.^*
Saran wrap? O_o Interesting word.
Never mind.
noooothing
that was a seriously sad flood.
/me eyerolls.
Orh.
Oh*
First thing that came to mind.
bah
Plastic wrap
I think he's the only person in that channel he's promoting
Drat.
Corriander?
I can barely hear you, silly.
omg a dude with a guitarr!
The herb?
hah
are these all the things you couldn't answer at the latest pub quiz? :P
Yeah.
Hmm.
How about...
Iks: that's Sketchy_Sounds
Chinwag?
XD
Slightly!
6D;
I just learned that ham is a term for the opposite of spam
weird
lol
Never heard someone use that term. Apparently informal conversation though.
I'm not sure I trust wiki on that
but whatevs
i figured... since it says Sketchy_Sounds at the top
Let's bring out the slang.
This should be interesting. XD
Lush?
wooooo!
as a slang word? no clue
the guitar kinda drowns out the voice
/me head bops.
6A drunk person? :3
Luna_In_Socks: yes. :P
I remember you saying no to that before.
It does mean drunk person, but as slang.
saywha
Lush is the only slang I've said now.
/me looks around for FallSilently
I have slang word.
/me puts on plastic moustache
Whoo ees thees FallSilently?
CMC?
this should be good.
I know my acronyms
Basically it just means something good, attractive, etc.
"Amy is lush"
6Dari is lush~
I just wondered why it is randomly said
Etc
Ohhhhh
direct the stream to here lol http://www.ustream.tv/channel/songcasts
first time i have heard it played on a guitar
1) I don't think the stream is currently running
it's the UK version VV
2) Don't advertise without permission please
6jaja~ Dari is something good
Exactly. Those words don't go in the same sentence. :p
Nonsence I think the US version works for Dari at times too,
I think he cheats by not reading this while singing.
and now the ceiling falls down on you.
probably
:D
:D
wow that's barely slang
Evil enchantress?
:o
hurrah!
6US version? o:
dont read my message!
ahh it breaks apart!
/me 's stream is asploding
Argh! THe stream! It's dying
D:
that stream is too awesome for any machine to handle it
:(
Omegle*
You're right. x.x
ustream went derp'd
dun dun DUNNN
Hi. Back from psychiatry appointment.
http://kimikonyanchan.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d495ons this be my pic for the day... :3
Us = Drinks alot UK = Something pleasing or desirable
and dont read my message
Apparantly he didn't know about Ponychan
Yush
Pinkie Pie breaks the internets again
it seems alright now
It broke pretty badly in the first half of that.
US version? UK version?
The meaning of words.
I have slang word.
Dari starting controversy.
/me notorious!
It's dirty tho
^^^ Dari being wrong you mean. :p
i don't, really.
i am sending him silly messages
probably read a comment somewhere
why not send them here
6I agree with you DE, victory! ;3
Yes, yes you are Dari. :p
because they are definitely not channel appropriate
ohoo probably something perverted
._.
Haha, now I want to know.
Hah, that's inventive.
Nice pic Fluttershy
If olive oil comes from olives, then where does baby oil come from?
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
:D
6Space.
baby olives
lol
Where's the slang word then?
/me gasps
yessss gatg~~
cya Fluttershy
6See you soon fluttershy~
he is going to laugh in a second
/me hugs Fluttershy~
see
6Get well soon
/me hugs DeniedExistence as well
cya
I know one reason, but I doubt it's the case
Bye Fluttershy
Haha, see you guys. And Barry, there is a reason... but I'll just leave you to speculate.
I wish I could draw...
-yes, is trolling- bye for now!
hah, we have an inside joke we throw back and forth
that*
I'm guessing it's gas, Fluttershy, would that be correct?
The only reason I know is that she's pregnant
aight, I need to wash up.
Keep on playing :D
*Headphone*
lol
but like I said, I doubt that's the case
bye
I dont doubt it...
Or...maybe she's just hungry?
/me smiles
that was pretty
Yeah I thought that too Barry, preg that is.
6BURN IT
aw
wat
IDK
lol
oh wow, i was just goint to say to play this
wait
going* even
there is a site for humanized ponies?
or am I misinterpreting hard?
6I read it on EQD
I saw taht too VV Thought it was more along the lines of having them hold things as if they had hads.
0_o
6She didn't like the BridleMaids poster
6Because it was in "human-like poses"
But she has the ponies stand on two legs for prolonged periods of time. Trixie for one comes to mind
*Insert shrugpony here*
well, I can see that
she stands on two legs only for the show
and isnt for a prolonged period of time
only when there are fireworks
Hi
hi.
maybe she just hates bridesmaids :P
or whatever that show is called
Eh...Well she DID play with ponies when she was young...
6JEAN VALJEAN <3
lol :P
oh
this is hard to understand when you're only getting half of the conversation.
when compared to everyone else I usually converse with
They are all totally nuts?
Yeah?
Brony's have a significantly higher percentage of actually getting my nick reference
/me hugs Luna
we're 20% cooler, val?
today, is gonna be the dsay o/~
sorry
that too
Oh Shiitake mushrooms
I don't get it
=(
Phew
i totally got it
hi =p

Val, from Trigun?
Hellew
Barry, you're breaking the statistics curve!
No, Val Valjean.
I think he's from there, anyway
Deied.. Bunker
Denied*
roflol, Daffy stole the toilet
Hi
i don't, but i know next to nothing about music
lol
val valjean? wow, yeah I definitely didn't get it then
>yfw I've never even seen trigun
No.
Who's Val Valjean?
Chanserv didnt give it to him though
I don't think...
Ask him
he's the protagonist in Les Miserables
oh lol
maps too == opposite of spam
hey
LOL, Les Miz. xD
because they think I'm talking about Jeans
never watched Les Miserables, but I did see Trigun a bit
=P
Val the pair of jeans.
That's why I think it was from Trigun
@Barry it's also a book :P
thought*
>watched
and oh u dari :P
hey.
lawl
lol
hi
Hi.
Back
Haro everypony

I just thought of something. In Boast Busters, Applejack was a hypocrite.
/me likes watching Luney Tunes.
No purple text today Val?
I'm disguising myself as one of you
I ninjar like that
but lol, Daffy actually stole a toilet
rammstein! lol
Val, I demand you show us color.. We need... Verification
What'dshe say what'd she say!!!
i said nothing

I take orders from nopony
that was beautiful.
i said he should turn on a light
I second that motion
seriously.
aye
Certainly a thousand steps up from the things they were doing with them before.
Show us the colors
speaking of which
oh, the music itself was nice enough
/me hugs Luna

very nicely done
it's a play on National Novel Writing Month
Nah. I doubt it
back in a few, need to go start a load of laundry.
it would just be the last time the CMC were shown onscreen, I think. Once that happens, they'd just get references
get out
no ponies allowed here
:(
as in, The Equestria Nation
and one viewer less... g2g hit the shower
bye
I was arrested for graffitting ponies
am i doin it rite?
Oh, well nothing like that's really happened to me.
Arrested for graffiti.
Not that I was, mind
Mine's much worse
My brother has been arrested plenty of times, since he's a bit of a retard...
:O
Zephiridd: STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
Lol
lol
If you were the only one not arrested in a family of convicts...
why?
zomg racism
lololo
it's because they're different :P
and we must hate different things :P
And you're sometimes treated differently
You're different, just like everypony else.
:d
It's my birthday? :o
:D
:o
no, she was the purple pony you silly
Hey
haven't you seen the show?
:)
go*
Excellence.
and I mean timeline, not episode, and it's an expression
fantastic
i loved that
Hey everypony
i have no requests, honestly. i am just enjoying
:o
!
maybe
;)
Well, in this case, not only was Twilight afraid of losing her friends for showing off, she was also afraid of defending Trixie for the same reason
i know terminus
<3
I'm just trying to make Barry go crazy
!gnaw
:P
I don't think Twilight had any urge to defend Trixie, really...
I give up
She was only doing her special talent, and the others were criticizing her for it
I was surprised they didn't keep Trixie
I'm back, and I'm speaking normally.
imo needs more trixie season 2
I wasn't. I hated her and wished she'd go away :P
And things seem to have taken a turn for the romantic.
*brohoof*
Trixie wasn't just showing off, she was willing to directly assault people.
any highlight or favorite moment of the season 1 ?
Maybe, but she did it on stage
mib_t8xeyo: /nick cookie22
as part of her act
and only on stage
It was less about showing off than about making others look bad
no, she egged them on
and here's the important part
oh
She issued challenges, and the others stepped up to take them
she STOPS performing when people start admiring her
she was doing it for attention
if she was a showmare, the show would have continued after the challenge
oohh, that was very nice
thank you, Sketchy_Sounds
thanks for performing!
but that's the same everywhere
Thanks for tuning in =)
and thus deserved the punishment she got
it stopped her from showing off :P
Going AFK
idk, ever since I read that fic where Trixie is Twilight's younger sis
lol she was pretty much asking for that
Probably not
I've liked her
even though fics have nothing to do with the show
.-.
/me pokes mib_t8xeyo
which luna thing
:)
cyrils song is boss
as the saying goes, "The show must go on".
the vid posted on eqd
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/when-she-loved-me.html#more That one probably
assuming she's a showmare in the first place
And she only issued the challenges anyway because of the neigh-sayers, as she said
Oh gosh, I'm watching it now
It was posted about half an hour ago. It's Jessie's song from Toy Story 2. One of the epicest
;~;
/me facepalms
If Twilight and the others just enjoyed the show, instead of criticizing it, it would have been a normal routine for her
It's from Toy Story 2
Trixie sucks.
oui
Jessie's song
i dont remember
sisters even
this.. sad
I don't really mind Trixie, but Barry is really making me not want to like her right now...
/me wipes her eyes
Not the saddest I've heard, but...top 10, definitely.
Wait you hate her cause some one else likes her?
/me barely avoids crying
mib_8kz65f: look over here too.
Hmm, Top 5, even.
Complete and utter nonsense.
Sometimes it's worse to say nothing, than to try to stop others
say and do*
07Stream's up
Good sameratin laws
But it's more of If you watch a crime happen and dont do any thing about it.
that's idiotic
You could be

good samaritan laws
hey brownies
You could be charged with a crime for not reporting a crime.
He's not that terrifying, is he?
You dont have to try and stop it just report it happend.
and I was ninja'd
okay, see now we're getting to a completely different subject
Pfffft XD

Pretty sure he means becuase of the link ;p
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo2448-AhFI&feature=player_embedded
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
wut
yes was for that :P
but she did witness and do nothing when Trixie used her magic to assault her friends. Some friend she is
You guys stream house yet?
Varying levels of guilt. But Guilt non the less.

I think he died?
I dint catch the beggining either
"most of he overseas stuff"?
Yeah as in not in the US.
i've nvr heard of one.
Yeah
oh
oh dear
inb4 he dies
Strangely quiet in here.
I'm calling it
nice
lol Ralphy
oh okay, I was close
There we go
oh shit
Is he still streaming?
That's probably why.
ominous silence
What's Luna streaming?
that would be House
House, season 3 episode.... 8?
Never seen it before
07correct
Hey now, some of us are trying to focus on FreeCell!
Hm, hm...
I'm up to 52% success!
no one else left but me :p
n__n
How are you?
I am quite fine.
That's good to hear~
fuck that cop
o__o
have a good day, everypony. I must be going.
an MRI, how creative.
lol
Hey
urgh just been playing Limbo
Hay?
xD
Silly filly~
hi
:)

Well, he probably has a couple houses.
Donnie Darko
good movie
lol
Never seen that one... Any good?
D'aww
having*
way to trick the kids house
even if you end up not liking it, it's a movie that you should probably see once
:3 sucks
People disappearing
hm? :D
Come back, everypony!
sonds like the quality was good already but now you can see it.
lol
I should be doing homework right now...
u got a server dont you? i'm thinking its mibbits fault. oh its okies but tht really long email i sent pretty much said it all.
do they have the hub watermarks Pinkie_Pie?
:)
I have FIM season 1 w/o watermarks...
Ohey
LOL
how is it hard to join an irc server
I mean seriously
although I really wouldn't recommend mibbit
:D
it kept throwing him off. not his fault.
oh hay dari
mibbit sucks
hey it works for me.
i would be all over a blu-ray set
^same ones
mchine
yeah same here.
of couse, if you could do that, you might aswell download an irc client
than mibbit, that is
I'd pay moneys for Season 1 Blu-Ray boxset.
Watermarks?
like send me a link to refer him to.
The colours are lighter
exept not
no box-set
watermarks would be like the Hub logo.
OH SHI-
ew
hmmm
You just made it.
oh good
Hi!
hihello
One sec, lemme check
chello
oh look housebeing raceist again.
thts mibbit. lol.
yeah, but its a direct link to the online client
No, no watermarks
Cat: Where is Cat1 ?
I like watermelons
...missing layers?
yeah
that is easier in python
:D
there are particular shots where certain characters are missing and whatnot
very nit-picky mind you
but there are inconsistencies
The itunes ones have a slightly faided color commpared to the hub versions
iunno
take, for example, the fear song
the shot where everyone is laughing
The version I have is more than just slightly faded colors
Lol
iunno
like, indentations?
i really hope it has some good special features
D:
o.o
You said something about missing layers? Any specific examples?
it would help to see a comparison shot or something
see the fear song example
[lo:ng:ti:me:ago] *Cat1 dies
:3
lol butt stab?
Lawl
it was a thread on ponychan, but I'm sure it's 404'd by now
butt stab must always be seem
Dash is missing?
/me ponders about wondering why his 2 irc servers keep splitting
Fuck the itunes version.
lol
/me deletes
Hey, Everypony!
lol i see her fine in my 720p version...
And watching House.
OW
Heya!
That little girl is the most mature person on this show :0
:p
I must learn how to program this delicate piece of silicon.....
lawl
/me restores from recyle bin
Ok.
He has everything
If Dash is still there it's all good.
The kid has EVERYTHING.
Silicon...?
GET ALL THE DISEASES!
Applejack and Rarity isnt in the shot where they all fall down laughing
Oh damnit... I have Itunes versions.
In my version
Well it is silicon
Program...?
Silicon with logic gates.....
Hi Herospirit
meh, then maybe I remember the specifics wrong
Why in the world is the Itunes version different than the normal one?
but there are still missing characters
/me breaks silence with a radio.
Okay
:O
http://i.imgur.com/mNI4B.jpg
But why, Payne, why
oooohhh
it was THAT shot
why are they missing?
missing layers
I always wondered why that shot had RD and Fluttershy missing...
Dash IS missing.
/me deletes again
Mmmm
lol
Wellll...
Ponies have been going on, talky
uh oh...did I just opena canof worms?
though as to why the itunes version has more inconsistencies, I have no idea
Really*
lol
untz untz untz
Damn you swype
maybe it's because they sent them the wrong base files? I dunno
Dash is missing in one shot? Dari deletes it
:p
weird
either way, it's still a rip-off to pay for episodes on itunes
yah that shot is definitely with missing layers in the 720p version I have
I have Winter Wrap Up stuck in my head... ^w^;
guess I'm downloading the version with crappy hub logos and stuf, then :(
asuming I am looking at the right snot.
*giggle* the right snot.
Hi
uh oh, explosion! aaagh
dvds... :(
or blu rays
I don't care
I just want them on some sort of cd
i care!
??
lol
Thanks
"Winter wrap up, winter wrap uuuuppp..." =_=;
Val would buy a bluray player just for Ponies.
its nah a tumor
/me sits in the corner, blinks.
LUPIS EVERYWHERE
Herospirit, I have the same version as Dari, I intend to delete..
Lupus*
Someone somewhere has proper versions.... Has to be
:OO
That doesn't mean I can't give Dari a hard time for doing a reasonable thing :P
Lol
suddenly stream cut off for me
They are nice but color is faided Fluttershy
The colors look fine to me.
/me burns her hand on cat.
ow
seems to work fine now lol
/me nibbles on Cat
Habro is spray-painting horses as we speak
Hmmm... I torrented mine though. =w=;
D=
Where can I download the version with dash in the highest possible quality?
Filesize is not an issue..
it adds extra flavor
lol wow
nothing
stuff~
lol, I should never have mentioned it >.<
lol
Homeowrk and a headache.
I don't want to admit to being sick or else I may really become sick.
it's not like anyone lost anything from knowing that :P
...except for their innocence, of course
It's not the colours, but now I can't be sure if there is actual missing content.
to tell you the truth I have never noticed any thing missing.
Fight the sickness!
lol
I have a strong immune system. Most sicknesses I feel and it wears me down but it doesn't make me bedridden.
you wont be missing anything SIGNIFICANT
just background layers and such
/me goes for a lie down
none of which are the main focus of the shot
:3
BUT RAINBOW DASH IS MISSING IN ONE SHOT
IT CANNOT BE TOLERATED
SUDDENLY PONIES
/me is playing: 692. Down With The Sickness  Disturbed  The Sickness  4  4:38 - 128kbps
I DEMAND IT BE PLAYED
wtf 128 kbps?
I know, but I'm not really that bothered by hub logos
lol don't with the sickness
oh yes! me too!
/me pets cat
hewwo.
!s2
:)
Season 2 begins in 9d:16h:14m:54s

Wouldnt there be a large quality loss if it was on DVD?
I just need a fitting pony-related song.
Hi

Lost connection for a second.
Rumour has it that DVD's have already surfaced here and there...
lemme check Equestria study
they released shit dvds with only 2 episodes on them
herospirit: SOOO AWESOME
the dvd's paired with toys
...? ...*
Eeeeyup, for the kiddies
they'll do a pretty good DVD set, I'd bet...
In this episode, House treats the clown in the park for botulism
The father is going to get hurt because we expect the kid to.
... ... ...*
How's the trixie fix coming?
Talking about Pony related songs
Fic*
Damn, I lose

Clearly no one likes me.

Anyway, got homework to do.

Does anyone know if anyone made any MIDI files on any of the music featured on the show?
Tell the truth: Did you jack off during or after Emerald's fun?
SNIPER!

I already have all 26 episodes in HD MKV h.264x

http://www.cracked.com/blog/write-your-own-house-episode/
My school only had plaques to show the names of all the people from the school that died in WWI and WWII

guacamole
Well *Crosses arms* I know I did.

*Smug look*

i didnt say i never jack off, i just dont do it as much
8
Did you though?
*creapy
o.o @ second comic
no
It's not creepy, as much as it's a cute misunderstanding of how babies are born.
ow was babby formed
*how
Well.
Anyway.
Derpy thought that babies came out of the oven.
The job was the Queen's gynaecologist.
xD
O.o
0.o
Probably because when parents talk about babies, they'll say "Yeah one's in the oven"
momma always told me Storks carried babies to famillies!
XD
LOLWUT
lol
lol wow
And he went to my school.
Brb, getting glasses fit.

!link word_of_Faust

http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/6169
But it also ripped Rainbow Dash from us for unacceptable periods of time

At first I was like 0_o
They just got 100,000 fans, and have a picture with ponies holding signs

Then, xD I lol'ed

Rarity would pick whoever looked the most fashionable
I'm good :3

Now I just need to get Dari's opinion.
If everyone stopped to say "hi" and "bye" to everyone else, there'd be no time for ponies, see...
Wait, are you saying you would have picked me?
lol

Personally, I never say hi when I join, unless someone greets me. I don't want to interrupt the conversation, and wait to see what's being said before saying anything. But that's just me.

Hmm.
I don't know Silvermane. :P
xD
STREAMCEPTION
Oh dear.
hurp
DURRRRRGGGGGAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR (because I haven't said that in a while)
it was first used when Brute betrayed Ceaser, I believe
there's no harm in trying anyway :D
lolololol

:p
Brutus

STREAMCEPTION

OMG THE STREAMCEPTION
Heh.
:O
oh dear
Adding insult to injury, eh server?
OOOH MYYY GOOOOOOOOOOG
THE STREAMCEPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fluttershy's streaming
I told you about doing that to the universe
DING<>!
draw us a pony please :3
Now how'd that even happen. It looked fine to me.
Hi, Fluttershy
Haro
The stream.
i'm tripping out man
I SEE MY MESSAGES!
It's a stream of the stream.
We're watching a stream of the stream
Of the stream.
a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a stream of a strem
of the stream.
We are watching Fluttershy streaming through Lun's stream
ninja'd again!
some clients are weird, i guess
of the stream
I think the stream at the end is waving at me
5I can see FOREVEEEERRRR
wait, this is fluttershy?
05hmm
total mindfuck
Yes Silvermane
Hey Fluttershy
(the answer is also eeyup)
/me hugs Fluttershy. "BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HUGGED ANYONE TODAY"
FLUTTERSHY IS BEST PONY
And that's why I always do that in the GeekShed window.
:P
Reasoning?
Don't worry, Lilfut, I doubt anybody cares.
^
haven't seen him in that before
and why i use autoidentify
Yup
some one ask for inception horn?
/me hugs Silvermane. "...because I already hugged Fluttershy."
i can even typo accidentally
http://inception.davepedu.com/
And that's how Equestria was made
lol

that kind, i mean
*can't
derp
mwahahahaa
I bet 98.3% of them are asleep anyway.
/me hugs Fluttershy
Make noises
/me eats a bagel
...why would that be blasphemous?
/me hugs Herospirit "...SO ALONE"
she does a cartoon about them now? cool
or ponies
i can have some bagel SilverMane?
/me hugs Herospirit
I don't have much opinion on it, but I wish her the best of luck with it.
because it's all bad? ;-)
(haven't seen anything of it)
<3
Oh, I casnt draw
<3
She's still watching over it.
?*
/me feeds herospirit to decapking. "It's a bagel! I swear!"
She's like executive producer or something now.
She can do more than one thing at once, you know.
Well, that's good. They can't pick up the idiot ball and run with it without some effort then.
/me hugs herospirit as well
Keep drawing
Eat me to gain my courage, decap
uuuh i like drawings
Lies, multitasking is a myth.
Oh, I thought she was going to do that?
She WAS executive Producer. Season 2, she's Creative producer, and she won't have her name on season 3.
herospirit never say it taht way again.
/me hugs Luna because i havent done that in a while
Why not do both?
>_>
...
Oh gog I'm sorry
i thought it was assistant producer?
oh, you
gog?
I saw the book, that's cool then.
yeah
hey, mind if you guys help me a bit?
^
WOOOOO
heh you are like Light, just with dramatic drawing instead of writing.
And they don't really have much variety in African American dolls.

Eh, I'm delirious myself. People thought it was a good idea to wake me up every hour to fix some problem or another.
3You may want to skip the parts you were here for.
apple mafia
BEATIN' STICK
Apparantly, I decided it was a good idea not to sleep
Going to do my homework. Only two problems in Calculus but I have to do a study guide of The Awakening and I don't know if I dislike it yet. The way Chopin writes physical descriptions reminds me of fanfiction writer. Just a paragraph of basic physical description and kinda randomly put in there.

And since it takes me about an hour to fall asleep...
That comic...

Dat voice is quite good
Hello everyone. My guild page has a link to this site - my whole guild is going to come here to watch the premiere of MLP:FiM Season 2. :)
3I saw kinkiness too...
I actually quite like the outdoors
3But I lost it.
It means bye bye Fluttershy, Luna, and Pinkie_pie as well. (I'm only talking to real ponies today)
But Do't tell me I said that
I'll lie
07Hey Beef how many people are you bringing in?
I see. Bai Silvermane
i'm off my rocker
Hey guys I'm back from schoolio
I'm gonna head home. See yall in a few
/me dances into a random building

I'll check behind my MAc too thogh
/me 15sets down Rarity for shipping time.
No..
More wall
not really, the stream she's watching is just at a much lower volume...
Fluttershy, how can you of all people not be scared by random loud noises..
Rarity is tied for 3rd best pony
I thought everypony loved my parties...
how did she even do that with the stream of a stream of a stream etc?
Or loud
It wasn;t something important was it?
material girl?
Rarity is OCD
Like, take medication?
that would sting
k
3he's bringing in people for the live streaming of S2 apparantly
oops
his name sounded like something out of #SilverShipper >_>
Extroverted, Feeling, Emotive, and something
I think you mean Rarity has OCD
3Hmmm? Nah.
well that's good
3You crazy GGgala.
>.>
Oh, thats good
/me is sorry
/me hugs Luna. "No more apologies"
4it sounded like a butcher
it's ok
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jbCJdTBhiIE/TmeqZPMeY2I/AAAAAAAALs4/kJDK-d2sHQA/s1600/blue+glow.jpg
which is why the second stream moves before the first,
DerpyBot is still on here?
rarity is OCD
It's not that bad of a thing, it's merely an inconvenience.
Theres a newish story on EQ daily
BEWARE THE LIGHT

Rainbow... I can;t imagine stickig to one character
Pinkie_Pie is always there
/me is embarrassed
Probably link if she did though
lol
haha
i think pinkie would go more for wario in gameplay terms
aww
sonic's not a starter character I don't think
NAw
Dash wants to win
3Well put DecapKing, well put.
Dash would be Meta Knight
a-ha!
Naw; Pit.
Worry not mein freund~
Only honeybees have barbed stingers
I whip anything with Falco.
Good News Everypony
i do think dash would go for pits cheapness
User_2227PartyCrash: NEED LINK NAO
/me specifically hugs Fluttershy to stop her tears. No crying
Well more of an preemptive-hug
/me is sucked into Silvermane's hug~
"your too slow" "your too slow" "your too slow"
or based on their personalitiies?
=D
Cause The Pinnacle Of Ponies is coming

The Pinnacle of Ponies
Yeah
I don't understand, what's with the eyes that makes him go gaga?
dari, you reading it or giving up?
The normal mobs are probably called Rainbow Western

BUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!

Diabolos 3
scootalooooo? scoootaloooooo?
07Fluttershy?
Oh.

scoot-scoot-scootalooooooo
For WoW I think they might be thinking of something
05highly likley
WE ARE
He's a character you need to be patient with
I was thinking they put out screenshots or something.
SAY MOAR
PLEASE!
Borderline creepy.
Though I can see her getting pro with DeDeDe
Quote the show with Pinkie Pie voice.
Pinkie would definitely play as Kirby
NO PINKIE IS WARIO
I can see that
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLyykueP00&feature=related
And whoever said I know way too many things about bees, I like to know all about the creatures I fear
Pinkie, I think
WOuld be Olimar
Lawl.
and would just seriously be pro with him
07indeed he is
Good Night from me
^ wut?
Good night
Still not AFK...
WHY?
i think pinkie would go for wario's jerky playstyle
15lawl wut
15DecapKing
:D
07:)
heh. you haven't seen that before?
05ooo, close
Nice
d'aaww
6House is also a kitty~
15i probably have, but i hate the song and it's a bit graphic in this context
6Good job Fluttershy! :DD
...
huh?
I don't know...
>a bit graphic
well taht was spot on.
awwwww
Which one was the sound clip?
and luna with the comparason.
4my thoughts exactly
!moon
Just because spike is a kid
nooo

A piate? Opiate? You dealing drugs in here?!
07keep trying
and Like all kids
fluttershy
you
He'd be annoyingly good
darnit!
are such a loudmouth
hehehehe
solo aint in here!
At the beginning of the episode she's meek.
:<
He'll be on around in about 2+ hours redd
But when Rainbow Dash performs her signature move, her meekness disappears
welp, theres only one thing to do!
EVEN HER SHNEEZES ARE GRACEFOOL
lol @ Yogscast
i think spike would go for an easy character
join EAD!
nice herospirit
"Are ponies suppose to have wings?" "I think it's part of the moon kin"
I try :p
or seriously PRO
>_>
No inbetween
o rly?
dohohoho
and I misspelled "misspelled"
http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/party-hard-b.gif
that was a fun intermission
I realize. It was spelled Fonically :0
Mmm, brownies...
Poof
/me claps bravo bravo!
poof?
Pondering which pony would play which character is SuperSmashBrosBrawl
Yes, it's difficult
4what intermission?
some accents are easier to write than others
it is as I feared, then
Boombox's Trixie fic
FRENCH?
this qualifies at research, actually
WUT
pomf?
I find AJ's accent the easiest to write
6German XD
Wat?
D:
Hmm... Rarity would choose either Peach or Zelda.
since it's for a story
on merits of their tactics, rather than their personalities
wrong button luna
Rarity'd be all over snake
yey house time
Hey, don't be dissing Peach and Zelda
ive never noticed dat transition before
4oh
Moar House
dat song
at the start just then
Lordlyhour: You have a point.
PHOTO FINISH IST EINE DUETSCHERIN
good night everypony!
night!
oh we're watching House again? :O
ergopossum is noob
4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-so-thats-where-it-goes-moderation-funnel-beer-drinking-bewbs.jpg
Pinkie is an Olimar. Or a Kirby
I bet Fluttershy would pick Pkmn Trainer, or Kirby
<3
House is a humbug, would have never guessed.
Fluttershy'd be all over DK
oh fuck
no wait
Angel would be DK
i think fluttershy would go for a defensive- oriented character
4http://chzallnighter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/party-fails-isnt-that-the-name-of-a-drink-beach-bjs.jpg
picking pikmin
There wouldn't be any tactics for her.
then protecting them
Meta Knight seems the most like Rainbow Dash as far as abilities
I think Rainbow Dash would pick Pit...
Yes!
truetrue
yus, but we're debating as to their tactics
not similarities between the characters
right
OH SHIT
maybe one of the fe characters?
House kinda deserves it in this case, though...
Fluttershy wouldn't be playing to win, she'd just sort of BE there.
/me hugs Luna :3
*HouseStare*
Dat glare
Oh. I dunnop
/me smiles at Fluttershy
I can see FLuttershy slowly becoming enthralled
She'd probably say "Oh! I'm sorry!" whenever she hits someone XD
/me hugs luna
I'm calling it
and just suprising everyone by destroying them
that's worse than fat-free half & half
6Thank you for that Fluttershy! :3
You're making the Smashbros series of comics?
Counfound my memory, It drives me to remember I have homework
Oh
2,14 in fact, I'll even thank you in colors :P
Also cool
i just read the most recent chapter
LAWL
I Don't actually READ that fic
/me hugs Fluttershy instead, since everyone else is busy hugging Luna
/me hugs Luna just for the sake of Luna
/me hugs Fluttershy
/me hugs the sky because lollipops
ask DE
Denied's fuckbuddy or something
/me hugs the entire room
/me is hugged, squeaks. O_O
Pinkie is OLIMAR
God-Tier Olimar
hah house lashing out at everyone.
Extra hug for Fluttershy from here too
/me hugs Fluttershy
but ahe'd never get them
Because she'd be all Pinkiesensing on the couch
and vgetting distracted
15i may have seen some of her work
/me is on the hunt for a snack~
herospirit, that can happen
"cuddy" and "idiop"
i wouldn't interprete pinkie as being easily distracted
Thanks for the entertainment Fluttershy
when i was playing, i would have been able to answer that without thinking
2,14 ewwwwww....non-tree
3She likes to keep to herself.
07She be back!
/me knows
Hahaha House.
ewww
I can actually see a Pinkie-ypshi or Pinkiechu situation
LOL
4its always the quiet ones.....
House likes some one that bites back
This is good episode because the chemistry between House and the mum.
she didn't get distracted
XD
In fact\
15all I know is... Shadowmane may have a target >.>
I think Pinkie coul kick but as just about any ofthe characters
3*Pffft*
3Yeah....sre
3sure
Twilight would likely have a bunch of psychic pokemons
She'd avoid Ganon like the plague though
3I'd like to see THAT
no
Maybe.
she'd convert canon to parties
again, i think pinkie would go for wario or gnw
Is there an open season on shipping ShadowMane <_<
2,14 I still like the classroom episode :P
Racing each other to catch 'em all
I was thinking that Alakazam and Gengar would roll, maybe also Zoroark.
Lol
http://cheezpictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/wtf-photos-videos-invisibilly.jpg
nice*
3Lol
:O
15naturally the first date didn't go very well after that
Zorua/Zoroark would be very much Rarity pokeman, I think
lol dat pic
Hey, 'sup.
The sky
nothin'
FLUTTERSHY HE NEED MONEY TO BE CURED!
Falco
lol
05PILLS HERE!
whoops
Oh my goodness you're right! He needs House!
MRI it fixes everything including metal lodged in the body.
Thats not a Hey, there both birds thing
Yeah, I was thinking Falco.
eh? why, he likes 'em with wings?
there
Its just how I see her playing.
But I kick butt with Falco.
I just need to get my Wii plugged in and back into the sport of SSBB, though.
house 1 - everyone else 0
Did we bring up taht house was right?
THEY PLAY WITH FREINDSHIP!
15If i were to venture a guess based upon my studies during my psychology courses, i may prefer fillies that have a natural advantage over me
House won without even being there
10 minutes of some training with Falco and I'm as good as a pro.
05actually by now its around 9001-3
05in houses favor ofc
lol
15earth ponies have strength and lack the weak points of wings and hornds
15horns*
Ponies used to be 6:30
15Unicorns have magic and a harder to reach point than wings, which can very easily be used for control
3I don't know...I wouldn't consider horns to be really sea...
3weak
4yeah but on me the most important weak point is bigger
Why is Jem at 6:30 now
15weak point as in sensitive
Brb, food.
they changes the schudule yesterday
reminds me of how i made pony character portraits for wizardry 8
15he means his nose
changed^
That blows, thought I could get 2 episodes in
4yeah, i'd say its pretty sensitive....
/me is a dweeb
every thing got bumped up 30min
lol
Its... Horrible
/me 15punches DecapKing in the nose.
It pulls me in
15that get you off?
with its completionism
It says "Lordly."
"Ctch them all"
lol sorry
4nope
I'm just messing lol
15good
And then, when I'm mostly done
HOROR!
there aren't enough boxes to hold them alkl
/me had a free sushi lunch today.
My collection is incomplete
awesome
BY DESIGN it is incomplete
no such thing
...sushi is delicious, though
unkown are much less fun to collect and much worse to look at
you like seasoned rice?
05aughta have said it was free for me
05a friend lost a bet, it was my prize
3Women.
never had sushi
/me loves Sushi
15hit it for maximum damage
/me brohoofs Fluttershy
for massive damage?!
/me brohoofs Luna aswell
4do i really have to say it?
15for massive damage
always, decap.
Woah last thing i did last night on here was taking about pokemons.

/me brohoofs Silvermane for taking the setup
And still waiting for Season 2. And you'd be laughing at them.

and switching between chats is easier in xchat than switching them in terminal
"a whole screen"?

Fun to be annoying and speak in a language that other people need to translate first. :p
terminals are awesome
(and i'm still sure then pressing alt+number is faster than clicking :D)
terminal cancer
?
just go to translation and choose english for translating them to
Да, тачно
you can turn on translation: Into English
Okay guys I know how to end the war.
I tried installing Arch but it hates my laptop
Hit translation at the bottom, set "translate them to" to English

I'm running Ubuntu for now until my MacBook Pro arrives, then I'll probably virtualize Arch

TRUST NO ONE SILVERMANE
Besides, I don't see where you are going with all this...
/me trusts 'No One'. I hope he's a nice pony
It's good if you're a starter.
k, cuz I own literally 75 magic cards
TRUST ANYONE, HEROSPIRIT
:0
Herospirit, Bunker
do you use /me to do that?
And watch the shoulder, not the arm! The shoulder moves first!!!
/me likes pie
how do you know my alias SilverMane?
And I'm not looking to dump a ton of money into it or play seriously at lots of tournaments, I just wanna have some cards to play with friends
Hmmm
Well then it's probably good. I saw one opened and it gives you pretty much all the basics you'll need.
How goes
4 boosters and 125 other cards, hmm
That's on a need to know basis
BOOKS
They sell them at my locals for $20
.
The way I look at it, 4 packs is $16 right
.
Yeah, and $4 for the rest is a good price.
/me is sad that ReticentSmolder/MirthTinker is grounded
Also, if you know someone down in a fight, make sure they don't get back up for a while!
Red/Black
/me foams at the mouth
From M12?
Yeah
http://cosplay.paheal.net/post/view/45358

That suit's...not too bad. Don't think I would ever wear one though.
I'll be
bet
Evening, everpony.
there is quite a bit of trashy cards though
you'll be bet
I dunno if one is coming out in 2012 or not, cuz if there is I'd just wait for that one y'know
dirty fighting only exists when sparring
LIES ALL LIES

err, flip those months
2011 march, 2010 may
Dohoho
Yesh Silvermane, that's different, of course.

Well hello.
...And RS
because its a lie
That one time.
Made me think it was the year 2012
WELL THEN.
and RS that one time... *sigh*
:)
Yugioh's the same way
But I dunno which are trashy
Dari always lurks
I see
Yo dawg I'm pro at Yugioh!
No you're not.
Yugioh has no pros.
Someone has to be pro
most cards are pretty easy to tell if they are bad ;)

?
Anyway
You should feel ashamed..
XD
dat upskirt
and still lands
I'm a bit disappointed that the Toolkit doesn't have Divination in it
Balduvian Frostwaker. They're 2/2.
I wanna turn my Red/Black into Red/Blue
She still annoys me for some reason
The minute I saw Divination, I had to run some form of Blue
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54704
AJ>RD
._.
form
Blums: took me hours just to do this: http://linuxmatt.deviantart.com/#/d482g92
http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pot_of_Greed This is why I want to run Blue and Divination :D
4chan
diviniation isn't that good
hersy!
dat camera-facing
*heresy*
3 drop, sorcery for 1 card
Its All about the Dash
Say Ancestral Recall and I dropkick you
Dash is cool and all, but I'm excited about them all lol
or Fluttershy..which ever one you like I guess..
hmmeh
do girls watch my little pony
!s2
Don't you need 2 people for that?
Season 2 begins in 9d:12h:07m:59s
CANT WAIT
Hmmm, I see

It is a muligender show.

Dumb fabric!

Um...hi?
how could u
20% cooler
Greetings, Lemon_Lime
10 seconds flat.
PsychicKid: I don't know, it might already be out actually
OMFG
Like this: eeenope
I don't play standard
Greetings Lysiria
yay~
Needs to be about 20% cooler.
lets have an orgy
PG Pony orgy/
*?
an overindulgance of pony watching?
PG
Or both
PG 13
either that, or he is an idol-obsessed nut job
nope.avi
Well, if I can get some Divinations from the common bin at locals, why not
dat boob grab
I just made $70 from selling some Yugioh cards anyway
Remember, the next rotation occurs just a couple weeks.
Ahh, ok.
When that gothic horror set comes out.
XD
11...is not a sentence.
How I imagine a PG orgy= "mmm yeah hold my hand!! OH YEAH! You too don't be shy Hold it nice and tight! OH YEAH!!"
(Man, those double-faced cards that set introduces are weird.)
Yeah I Saw those
/me 11is about to go exercise insix
dat chill face
Soooooooooo a PG orgy is essentially Fluttershy.
Then people raged for spending $600 on a set
http://ponyspin.com/
hentai-san?
Hentai-San...
I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh! but I hear their rulings system is a mess.
is that like the girl name Yuri?
It's making progress.
where it isn't the perversion we think it is?
I don't try to understand yugioh anymore XD
LOL
Anything involving the damage step is cryptic and pandora's box-y
jumping out of a train is a coincidence?
Exactly.
I've heard players saying
I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh
"I'M USING MY PRIORITY" or "I HAVE PRIORITY"
it is pretty simple!
err
I play Magic The Gathering
*RETAIN
There's reasons I stick with Magic.
hello everypony !
You don't "use" priority, you either have it or you don't
Going to refresh the stream after this ep.
roushguy: well, it is the same in mtg
Cards never have priority, only players do
ignition?
You can no longer play an Ignition effect in response to a successful summon
dat upskirt
dem panties
again, upskirt
YOU ARE ALREADY PARTYING
Yeah, like Exiled Force for example
XD
Full Metal Panic: I watch it for the plot
Nyan deck?
what's going on there ?
Sticking to 60 cards is always best, though.
Eh, close enough =P
dat cat
slim it down to 60
Nah
Trust me
When Japan announced they were changing Ignition effects, American players went on hurrdurrretard mode and immediately thought that Priority itself was going away
Wild Pair, Lurking Predators, and a ton of 5/5's
And 6/6's
Yeah.
dat blush
FUCK YOU GUYS< DRAWFRIENDS I HERE
That evil laugh
> join stream
> that laugh
She is Rarity
"You can't do that, priority doesn't exist anymore."
It is fragile
I mean
If they have enchantment destruction
lurking*
Anyway
13Drawfriend time!

Tomorrow or sometime next week I'm gonna buy the deck toolkit

/me blushes. "Awww...."
Sweaters are not as good as socks. This is fact. This is reality.
#9: "GRAB MY TAIL, SCOOTALOO!"
SilverManes mind
How hard would we hav to try to get Twilight's VA to narrorate "Go the Fuck to Sleep"?
Homework time

I need to ask Twilight about that one.
6Only ten scoops? D:

3Hello again.
wow Herospirit, not hard to satisfy you is it
I suck at english though not because I can't write but because I hate the stupid "layout" bs i.e. MLA format plus the whole Thesis statement BS
6<.<
1000 years on the moon, and all you want is 10 scoops of ice cream?
oh man, I can either write a lot in terms of essays
or nothing
it tends to be nothing
Must be realy good
my mind is sort of turning in on itself
I hold my grudges quietly.
My mind clicks off of focusing on something occassionally.

My brain basically becomes Derpy.
15oh look at that
Just kidding, I suck at holding grudges

/me picks Fluttershy back up, dusting her off. "Sorry, I'm just, ermm, /friendly/ i suppose."
night all!
I still want some Bobobo on this stream someday.
4right, /friendly/
inb4 someone orders squid
mfw fastest shipping ever
I would rep both of those pretty hard
4you would have to look through my mind to get it
every time I hear someone say sorry in Japanese I immediately think of "USODA"

gnight
lol
......0_o
I came to a realization
/me 8hums quietly to herself.
never
And that you can never go back
This amuses me.
http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/files/2011/06/AmericanAtheists-550x329.jpg
One of my favorites of all time
oh she mad
And then
/me shuffles off carefully, suddenly nervous. "Nope, nothing to see here, not a crazy fanboy or anything"
/me 3strums a guitar.
As I played, I thought...
?
PONY
Plorf: I don't understand.
3~Decaps been shipping, with mares all day~
Basically
EVERYTHINV NEEDS MORE PONY.
3~Will his mind continue to stay?~
^
moar
^
*everything
wow
4sadly, probably not
3~I may know, but its a conspiracy~
IVE SEEN ENOUGH HENTAI
inb4 the genre changes
*miserable LITTLE
Oh I didn't know that
Lol :p
3~Shipping is awesome...I mean seriously~
http://noplan.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dave-silverman.jpg
okay...*processing* lol
You always expect it but it never happens.
shes just misserable
Hayonetta
8brb again sorry! ><
4actually that would be pretty fun to lose my mine....
/me waves bye to Fluttershy
4*mind
3Your mine?
good night
4it would suck to lose my mine
gnight
Night
4cause then someone would get blown up probably
dat sound effect
the wet squishing and flopping... *shudder*
I'm a hony.
4it would make things interesting
Or a pega-sis
RAPE FACE
I don't remember which episodes are in the first... uh.... episode
lol wut
they mispelled "cannon"
to the moon?
> moon cannon
I don't like making a seperate term for females ponies.
Oooh, my DL is done. ^_^
We call them normal
haha
lol
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV2vfWUFtJ8&feature=related
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
3So....we doing any RP'ing today for any reason?
We need to take this scene, and put it with ponies.
4besides it would give me a reason to wear my gasmask i used for halloween for that one year more often
That cannon needs a "On the mooooon" soundbite.
You just jelly that I'm a peg-sis
3 0_o
Umm yeah its called equallity
4what?
wow, it even took him to the moon
Mmmmmbananas?
She is not just busy, she is squiddly busy
I've heard "pegasister" rather than "peg-sis"
Equality doesn't lean towards bros.
I am toats hitting on this Fluttershy gel
07>mfw squidvade
The subtle pun in pegasis is lost in speaking
silly
> conquer the chairs and tables
this anime is silly
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m17I0filMLU

There's no need but I would still like to be allowed to.
Just to say, "I'm a hoeny for ponies."
3Wasn't me.
LOL hays

4well then it must of been the vodka
4and the riot punch
I honestly thought he would put snakes on his head or something
I goodness
Never enough squid

Hay

They didn't "get away" with it. That's h9ow the show is.
Hmm I was just wondering cause I was like wait did he jsut say that?
"DOn't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches."
Silvermane left

I THINK I LIKE THIS SHOW.
07WAT?!
0Oh, wrong anime
It's like something straight from Pinkie Pie's fanfic journal
Sci-fi writers are just... crazy
Awesome crazy
I know, it's a good kind
This show is made of random, much like me
/me 0is poker facing at the standard fare.
Guys... we write fanfics about Ponies, right?

6My train of mind goes SPLAT SPLAT
Herospirit. Fund it

I'm still here, I was just trying to make sense of this show
0Silvermane
Silvermane and every one else here
IT was young adult, but this scene... lemme copy it for you to see.

0Pinkie Pie must be a master of inception
Yeah you see, I'm pretty sure that book was aimed at Goths and Emos
6XDD
Boring
6Breathe in diamonds~
All you need for a good story is sex and violence
and ponies
4as i still want some vodka
Everything we know is a lie
Maybe also for med students, I dunno
0I hate it when that happens
just ponies actually
I realy wanted to startle you all with inception horn but I just couldn't do it.
WAT
Hey

/me thinks of Spin

About experiments that went too far or went wrong
I am not making this up. That's why I read this book. It's crazy.
JAN

Well, yeah, I know about that, I meant the stream :P
Now you've made me baww
Ooooh.

Is that dangerous?
11Where is Mirth?
no, just someone online with it
Okay, I'm done, sorry.
Where?
But I use ponies to counter that
-___(\
Well it's fine, but with Elie Weisel that was real.
