doesnt he get his head chopped off?
11Due to wanting to watch this, and the shere SIZE of how much Trivia there is, I'll be limiting how much of it I'll do.

And this is Gandla'f "oh, Crap" moment...
PHYSICS!
0"It says bitches be trippin"
3*Ahem* Elvish.
Moooooordoooooooor
R.I.P. Elvish Presley
8>inb4 allegory for WWII
11Bjornfot: Agreed 100%. But that's politics, and I don't feel like discussing it.
4Did I mention I'm fluent in Elvish?
8>inb4 allegory for religion
he made a poem aww
0>inb4 an allegory for norman invasion
0@bjornfot we entered because of the japanese and germans sinking our ships
Ash naghz zimbatul! or something
4 4i se tipprova
tome bombadil could walk into moridor
0>inb4 really open ended allegory
Also, you killed a lot of innocent japs for no reason.
It says Has anyone ever been as far as to go even to do look more like?
10GANDALF OH SHIT HERE WE GO
He exploded, then exploded again!
>inb4 not an allegory until overanalyzed
4No no
Ron_Weasley is hax0rz
3Bjornfot, WW2 would have ended without the US, but then Europe would be Communist
oshi- politics
10legolas YFW Battle of Britain
3But other than that, yeah
wouldnt it be easier
to have like
11Still random trivia, isn't it?
a team of hobbits
really quiet for anyone else?
We'll put it away!
Voldemort?
0bjornfo, they would have kept coming if we hadnt dropped the bombs
He rebuilt his castle. It didn't help that we forgot to station anyone in there to watch for these things, but that's besides the point. :D
in the same place that lost socks go
and its sort of like a relay race to mordor
0bjornfot*
4Well
0@gandalf gloriousexpositioncomrade.jpg
3Ron_Weasley Oh I know, but defense doesn't invade normandy
4Yeah, sorry for not telling you, Frodo. My bad?
yfw Tolkien actually considered making languages a hobby, and made Elven and many derivations with full vocabulary and grammar, enough to enable him to speak it
3Bjornfot Well...after WWII...yeah we fucked up
well, at least all of germany
10Yeah but Britain wasn't lost. Mainland Europe was, and they're all rubbish anyway ;)
Don't come and say that eg Hiroshima did any good.
How astute, frodo
But thats where I live!
TAKE IT
0Oh wait
4I don't want it >: (
15TAKE IT!!!!!
"But that would lead them back... home!"
11TEMPTATION!
DO NOT WANT
aw, you think we're rubbish, Ron_Weasley? :(
0@bjornfot Europe was fucked and britain was next
I want it
FRodo has LEVERAGE!
4I would like to remain single, Frodo
any second now
actually britain was doing okay by itself
its gonna be bilbo

10xD
3. ???
giggidy
Oddly, Gandalf's best decision ever...
yup. Samwise saves the world.
Yes, ARE. You had nothing to do in the middle-east either. Bush only went in there for the oil.
Best, Sidekick, Ever.
5. Endure implied homosexualism for eternity
3Bjornfot I don't doubt that.
bodyguards are too mainstream
By 'Sidekick', you of course mean 'Lover'
0This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
no its not
brokeback mount doom
inb4 incredulous Ho-Yay scene
wait
Srsly guys, this is manly shit
push him
4@Odin: You haven't seen homoerotic until the third film
he remembers his EXACT step?!
8<Odin>: This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
It's really just that those two look like they should be-- but they aren't.
Why does everybody insists on seeing sex everywhere?
0I know
8i lol'd
3Bjornfot I think we never should have gone into either
lol, he saw the line he drew around the shire
To be fair, there is a scarecrow
Suddenly Ian Holm voiceover
Ponies are about 20% manlier than LOTR
DONT GO PAST THIS lINE OR Ill BE OUT OF THE SHIRE
3Bjornfot But to say we should have known is hindsight blindness
This is starting to sound like one of those dumbass arguments they have on /b/ over which country is the best.
Is it still clever to say Dildo instead of Bilbo?
7EQD hates us?
4Celine Dion is among them
"Let's go take nekkid pictures and put them on the hobbitnet!"
not really
SUDDENLY
ELVES

FORESHADOWING
10we've got 119 without EqD?
3*Ahem* Elves are definitely awesome.
10Fucking win
america>germaany
Elves look more like ghosts...
you can tell they're elves because they naturally emit bloom
Douche baggins.
Thats no root
thats because the ELVES are in sad mode right now
then they look like ghosts
induring random nationalism
Have Merry and Pippin come in yet?
look at that bloom effect
I see WHY they cut these scenes from the theatrical cut
Elves are tall, blonde, blue eyed whites. Oh Tolkien
4Still no post?
they should work for infinity ward
8nope
Elves are self-righteous putzes
blonde?
eeeenope
@Bjornfot,stop hatin' on the US.It only makes them angry.
8i emailed him about 15 minutes ago
DAT HORSE
>yfw Tolkien wrote the books before Nazis came along
Elves are like vulcans with more rage.
even their horses are evil.
BANANAS
SARUMAN

Dat score
>yfw This is fantasy
You can tell just by the design of that tower that it's evil.
To Isengard?
That's a very evil looking tower
0bjornfot: ok lets say we didnt drop the bombs on the japs and they kept comming....
The grrrrrreat and poweeeerrrrrful Saruman
I'm not hating on US citizens, or even the country itself. I'm hating on their leaders, mostly.

Saruman. It's like a stereotypical Asian saying "Slenderman."

I dunno, I gladly hate on the US media.

he wouldnt
0That's mostly because of the fact that you had a personal part in making middle earth.
@lemonloaf: They don't just eat, they smoke and drink too. Didn't you hear Bilbo? :p
oh no, not again
Wait, don't they use those swamps later in the Two Towers?
