7good suggestion
4Gandalf the Gray
14Hey!
14:P
I never understood why the Gods didn't just help defeat Sauron, he was a bitch compared to Morgoth

Discord is supposed to be seductive in a way. How will he do that if he looks like Megasatan?
10xD
So basically, the world is at risk because people are dicks.
reticent: that's stupid, the movies came out after 2000 and there were many rpgs before that
14And if he is, he's lurking and not signing in

0@samwise read the screenplay demo, he is dark as shit, he tries to turn the mane 6 against eachother and even kill

10Oh god so you guys are going to post in the wrong colours?
>two and a half thousand years of ZERO technological advancement in middle earth
14Someone posted in pink a sec ago I thought...
I wonder discord looks like hexxus from ferngully lol
the world would be at peace
0@Edwardnewgate the gods could only interfere with other gods. In addition, the entire Noldor got banished because they intervened
10I have no idea who anyone is
nope, EdwardNewGate.
For two and a half thousand years, we made no technological advances what so ever

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Originally the narration at the prologue was to be spoken by Elijah Wood, but it was felt that the information imparted had little bearing on the character of Frodo. Ian McKellen also recorded a narration but once again it was felt that Gandalf wasn't the right character to speak it.

Polystyrene?!
dat extended edition footage
New Zealand has an army?
Take a shot every time someone makes up a new drinking game condition in the chat window.
Considering this movie is longer than a usual A and B movie combined, I'd say it's enough
we are watching one extremely long movie
>yfw there are ponies in this movie

For some reason, I feel a strong craving for Gandalf/Frodo

So wizards can't be late. Everyone else is just early, obviously.
11RANDOM GANDALF TRIVIA: Tom Baker was a candidate for the role of Gandalf after his brief, but praised, cameo as the dying elven king in Dungeons & Dragons.

I saw a thing about how they built that bench specifiacally to make Frodo look small and GNDALF REALLY TALL, IT WAS COOL.
I don't think I'll stop smiling for the next 3 hours and 30 minutes
Well, Ian McKellen is openly a wizard

SPOILER: PEGACORN IS MY BITCH WHO LIKES MMMM BIG BLACK STALLION-BANANAS
Trixie would pwn gandalf
The Hobbit will be the most famous movie of the decade. I'm predicting the future here.
I really liked watching the extras and how much they put into using fancy props to achieve the various special effects instead of computer graphics.
The Great and Powerful Gandalf!
Total Trixie magic right there

WITNESS THE POWER OF
BANANAS
/me 10was right after all
Alrighty. 'Cause that's the one trivia I know pretty much by heart
now for gandalf's weed pipe
FUN FACT: Frodo is ment to be in his mid 40's
11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: The hobbits needed to appear about three to four feet tall - tiny compared with the seven-foot Gandalf. This was often accomplished using forced perspective, placing Ian McKellen (Gandalf) consistently closer to the camera than Elijah Wood in order to trick the eye into thinking McKellen is towering.
Well, you won't find any bananas here. But I know where you can find some!

Oh wow. I can see the forced perspective. It's weird.

12You sly dog.
RobotPinkie: I wish I had some but ive gotta save some money for going out tomorrow
15I'm not that meanspirited, Meanwhile
11RANDOM HEAD-CEILING TRIVIA: Gandalf's painful encounter with a ceiling beam in Bilbo's hobbit-hole was not in the script - Ian McKellen banged his forehead against the beam accidentally, not on purpose. But Peter Jackson thought McKellen did a great job "acting through" the mistake, and so kept it in.
flutterpeanut lol
Hiya Flutterpeanut
13Ohai.
I forget that gandalf can answer
Gimli: That's actually awesome
Plus it's amusing
ohai mark

Gotta love ad-libbing.

3Besides, that way you don't need the Coke
All the mods should be the powerful characters
I only has a couple of beers, though....
ad libbing makes the best films
I'M RUNNING AWAY AND NOPONY CAN STOP ME
Ian McKellen is a champ
can you do that? can you run away twice?
Legolas well at least i won't fall asleep now
Rezo: So long as it's /good/ ad-libbing.
I'm old too, stop complaining
10Samwise, I'm the best character
That's the understatement of the day bilbo.
8hmmm
You're 111
Gandalf and Magneto. 2 different ends of the wise old man spectrum.
0ah god damn it
11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: When you see Frodo and Gandalf sitting on a cart at the beginning, forced perspective means that Elijah Wood is 3 feet behind Ian McKellen.
If i was like, 80, i probably couldn't walk
0it's looking like I'm getting kicked out of the library
8i cant unban peanuts IP from the mod channel for some reason
I know Ron_Weasley, but I'm a close second
Cerebro?
Magneto?
...Know what I haven't done in a while?
Smoke weed erryday
8ah, because we dont have ops in here
weedo?
mofos getting baked
10Samwise, true. True.
0I'll try to find another place for Wi-fi, and if not I'll check to see if the internet is up at home
Weed hax

10yeah

5Make pretty colors.
Pegacorn you silly pony. Stopp running from everything and everyone.
gandalf is adicted to pipeweed
I can smoke boats
I have a new goal for the evening...
show off mage
10and we can't set the exception either
11RANDOM GANDALF TRIVIA: Ian McKellen hadn't read the books when he was first approached by Peter Jackson to play Gandalf. It was Jackson's enthusiasm for the project that won him over.
Gandalf is Trixie!
0Damn Gandalf. You and your weed
0in the event I don't see you all in a bit, have a fabulous LotR night bronies
10mfw Odin
Gandalf is such a boss.

Hey you know what this calls for?
odin
Big damn cake
12The irony.
bye val
CAKE!
A PARTY!
Razzle Dazzle
Showoff.
And we transport to the end of the third Star Wars movie with the ewoks
A LIE OF A PARTY
0PINKIE IS HIDING IN THE CAKE
Gandalf VS Ursa Major.
Was that an Andy Serkis cameo?
will you be off val?
0Tee hee.
Maxaminus IT'S A LIE!
gandalf wins
15And that was why I'm the champion of pipe smoking
Frodo's such a pimp
I CAN RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING I WANT
RAINBOOM
EPIC FIREWORKS
i wish they'd play the safety dance.
nuclear fireworks
Dragon firework is best firework.
15As well as firework explosions
Is it just me or do you hear dings?
Gandalf makes the best fireworks.
trolls gonna troll
Arguing trolls
Dat reciting of the troll scene
THE WHISTLES GO WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tree Trolls, remember that
00Why did they use any of the fireworks in battle?
dem hobbit references
/me 10had a really great local Yorkshire Ale with his dinner in the pub.
i was afk
00didn't
0Gandalf, you so tall
*Three
did i miss the dragon?
YOUR SO FULL OF CRAP BILBO
WAHAHAHAHAHAH
the story of the trolls of the internet :p
Hi guys,Am I late?
Three Stone Trolls
14Shoot, needs moar bright colors
You don't even need to edit that scene for it to make sense.
Sam is Frodo's loyal ninja.
Tictac: they didn't have any on hand?
CHILLI...
Fool of a took
0TROLLS
8told him we're just gonna use the skype chat
BABYBACK RIBS
gandalf shooting fireworks like a boss
OH YES!!!!!
Great and Powerful Gandalf
3Dat Fireworks
Butterflies go to houses. Burn houses down.
dat facial expression
they jacking fireworks
Actually, that did happen... Gandalf confused the trolls by imitating their voices.
0EmmettBrown, what an odd thing for someone like you to say
Gandalf VS Twilight
WHO WINS
00Man they would have been so useful
INCOMING PROBLEM
0Shad, Twilight
3Eeveesprit LIKE A BAWWSS
This wasn't what I expected a-tall
Gandalf wins. Flawless victory
/me 11loves the extended footage
twitchy twitch
Gandalf's fireworks > Fred&George's fireworks (sorry Ron_Weasley
Lemons ^
no contest Twilight Sparkle
10I can't use skype and stream most likely. It's already skipping enough already
Dragon Firework!
i'm happy for ya'll and ima let you finish
FOAL OF TOOK
hes on drugs again
wins
dat apple
Arrived just in time!
but twilight is one of the most magical ponies of all time
11It really adds to the story.
OF ALL TIME
/me 4also enjoys the extended edition
So how long is this film?
10Samwise you know that's not true
Twilight doesn't have the pipeweed skills to take on Gandalf.
Something like 4 hours, Bjornfot.
I think 3 hours
/me also enjoys the extended edition.
4I must admit, I've never seen the extended editions
11RANDOM PIPPIN TRIVIA: During Bilbo's party Pippin can be seen in the band playing a guitar.
i want some of that homebrew :(
So this is extended? nice
/me 0only likes extended footage on a movie he's seen
I WUBWOO
movies like 5 hours of walking to a volcano
Nice
Gandalf would be a gent and let Twilight win, but he could beat her at any time.
SPOILER: Sauren dies in 2 days
It's long enough that it's on 2 DVDs.
OH YES!!!!
i have seen the extended editions
INCOMING
/me agrees with the mods
i have seen them often
3ITS A FLYING TENT YEAH
fail
they are WAAAAY better then the originals
ROCKET TENT :D
i love the Clerks 2 description of these movies
0theyre doin it right
Dwagonssssssssssssssssssss
does this video have the cut between the two discs?
TENTS IN SPAAAAACEEE
i mean, they are like 20% better
Shit be on fire, yo.
10I bought her a flying tent. Bitches love flying tents.
11RANDOM SCREAM TRIVIA: When the dragon firework goes off at the party, the shriek heard is Billy Boyd actually screaming, as he was unaware at the time that the firework was really going to explode on set (he thought that it would be put in digitally). It was not scripted, but that take ended up in the final film.
Extended is the intended version
if not 50%
Theatrical is balls
Gandalf would win a duel with Twilight while showing less power than Trixie.
or even 80%
/me tries to run away from Bjornfot but falls on his face
Yay, the fireworks almost killed us! :D
4Now now
busted
0THEY CAME
>inb4 if Tom Bombadil was tree, then who was fone?
Return of the King is almost an hour longer
3YOU SHALL NOT GET AWAY PEGACORN
I can't tell where gandalf's hair ends and where his beard begins
Well not really, theatrical cuts are pretty good...
SPEEEECH
3IT IS IMPOSSIBURU
are we going to be able to see the car in the background later? :P
now time to smoke Wizard Weed
10SPEEEEEEEEEECH
00Spike was celestia?
I don't usually set off fireworks, but when I do, they're giant fucking DRAGON fireworks
...So Fluttershy wishes she was Tom Bombadil?
Oh Pegacorn... why are you running fro me? You liked what we did last week, didn't you?
11RANDOM HOBBIT HAIR TRIVIA: Every actor in the film wore a wig apart from Billy Jackson, the director's toddler son, seen listening wide-eyed to a tale told by Bilbo Baggins at his birthday party, had the perfect Hobbit hair.
Ah, Merry and Pippin.
3Did he say drugs...?
YES WE CAN
/me 0shoots pegacorn in the leg
holy!
If FLuttershy wants to be a tree, would Bombadil want to be a Fluttershy?
4I'm well aware that the one known as Trixie is quite the egotistical wizard and you would all like to see me put her in her place. But I am an honorable gray, I will not do such things
eleventyone
Bilbo is badass :D
0Did he just say 11tee one?
11Tom Bombadil
I thought we could, but it turns out those other guys are assholes.
/me is limping
Trixiue is badass
Bombadil is fluttershy

CHAOS CONTROL
gasp
4Oh, that mischievous Bilbo

That doesn't make sense though, Tom bombadil is Fluttershy in the movies, but in the books he's definitely more of Pinkie Pie
4Always turning invisible
ursas don't have fists
Guess I'll go play some TF2 instead.
Wat da fuck!?

Wait what sorcery is this?!
0THIEF OF RUNES
Hahahaha, i'm playing with the fabric of reality
He's not actually in the movies that I can remember.
The Precious!!!!
I think we are all missing the main point here...
Gandalf has ranks in ninja as well as wizard
Legolas, are you new to Brony Movie Night?
AND in Swordman.
3eeenope
2nd week here for me, sadly I missed the others
D:
12Gandalf is multiclass? What sorcery is this?
When was the last time you saw a completely round door?
11RANDOM TREE TRIVIA: The large tree that stands above Bag End was built especially by the production department. Every leaf had to be manually attached.
4Sorcery?
BTW
Gandalf is Gestalt
very much an NPC type.
one thing i can not wait for in the hobbit
is
Saruman
4My dear lad, I'm Gandalf the Gray. My experience spans the lifetime of a thousand men
00I feel bad for the production department.
3Why do you ask Bjornfot?

I LOVE U GANDALF

Note to self: Don't piss off the wizard.
I like how Bilbo's like "o.o hold me"
gandalf is helping him, LIKE A BAAAWS
4I also have a degree in lighting
Legolas, D_E?
Hold me, like you did by the lake in Naboo
let go of your hate
3Denied_Existence
<Bilbo> "I think I wet 'em."
Tolerate and love the shit out of Bilbo
Gandalf is Trixie, it's official

Gandalf is like

WTF

"Show me the that magic wand ITS MY NEW PRECIOUS!"
THE GREATER AND MORE POWERFUL TRIXIE
4Pegacorn, I do not take challenges lightly
epic music
ACCIO RING!
11RANDOM CHAPTER TRIVIA: The chapter titles "A Long-expected Party", "A Short Cut to Mushrooms", "The Bridge of Khazad-dum", "Lothlorien", and "The Breaking of the Fellowship" from "The Fellowship of The Ring" are spoken lines at their respective points in the storyline with the exception of "The Breaking of The Fellowship" which is foreshadowed during
0WHY CANT I QUIT YOU GANDALF
11during the scene at "The Mirror of Galadriel". "Riddles In The Dark" is also mentioned - the name of a chapter from "The Hobbit". In the extended version released on DVD, the prologue title "Concerning Hobbits" was mentioned by Ian Holm (Bilbo) in the opening scenes at Bag End - before the first chapter is named.

Dat ring
Oh that Bilbo!!
Gee, thanks, Uncle Bilbo, for RUINING MY LIFE WITH TAT DAMN RING.

That's cool, Ron_Weasley
Gandalf found your porn ;)
So, you wanna play hard to catch eh, Pegacorn?
GANDALF, how did you find that?
IT WAS UNDER EEEEE
4I traveled to the Ancient Library of Twilight Sparkle in order to seek the knowledge over the One Ring
Gandalf is gandalf
YAY!ARAGORN HAS APPEARED.
Gandalf is Twilight, Saruman is Trixie
Gandalf's Celestia
4My findings were less than joyous
Gandalf is Woona.
But wait
Dermathil: got to read it for my lit class
Because if there's something that med school needs, it's a lit class
I don't mind that much. Except it's 1200 pages long. So yeah
/me 8has been here the whole time
at least personality-wise
14Woona <3
I had a dream that Discord was a pony version of Sauron and everybody in the world converted because the first S2 episode was so epic.
gandalf is everpony
How the fuck does Gandalf use magic? He's no unicorn.
Gandalf is Trixie and Twilight's child.
He packs Twilight's brains with Trixie's style.. and Celestia's talent for not giving enough damn information.
It could be worse. Sauron could've called on Nightmoon Moon instead of the ring.
Gandalf has a horn under his hat
that would be awsome
doesnt he get his head chopped off?
11Due to wanting to watch this, and the shere SIZE of how much Trivia there is, I'll be limiting how much of it I'll do.
mobileDCD, it is 3 books long total
He has a staff made of unicorn horns.
lol
Makes sense, DSNesmith
I AM BADLY HURT
00Gandalf was sent to the shire to learn about friendship but also stop the return of the evil Sauron

BURN BABY BURN
11Starbuck: That autistic kid is fucking awesome.
"OH GOD IT BURNS"
Spoiler: this movie is awesome
Gandalf is quite cool
00@sam but what killed King kong
Fuck, it's hot!
pulling out your hand is cool?
"Whoops, not the ring then"
It's at least 20% cooler than other rings
so
4@Meanwhile: DO HO HO
@Meanwhile the beauty
the real question is
Gimli... US only jumped into WW2 at the last minute and then claimed to have "saved" us all because they were retards who wanted to appear cool.
and then gandalf got frodo a ring cutie mark
I see a beautiful hobbit face with clear blue eyes
eagles
4Er, I mean, ha ha. You make me laugh, lad
And then Gandalf went 'aw shit'
And this is Gandla'f "oh, Crap" moment...
NICE ONE RobotPinkie
PHYSICS!
0"It says bitches be trippin"
3*Ahem* Elvish.
Moooooordoooooooor
R.I.P. Elvish Presley
8>inb4 allegory for WWII
11Bjornfot: Agreed 100%. But that's politics, and I don't feel like discussing it.
4Did I mention I'm fluent in Elvish?
>inb4 death of the author
it says if found, please return to sauron, lord of darkness
8>inb4 allegory for religion
all that on one ring?
he made a poem aww
0Wow us, Gandalf
Did I say @Meanwhile? I meant @Tictac
Ah, the language of Mordor.
0>inb4 an allegory for norman invasion
>yfw Tom Bombadil represents...the neutral party
/me 10casts a spell to make him fluent in all languages
0@bjornfot we entered because of the japanese and germans sinking our ships
and now for my grade 3 show and tell class
i will recite a poem
4 4i se tipprova
tome bombadil could walk into moridor
Nope
0>inb4 really open ended allegory
11RANDOM ELVISH TRIVIA: The Elvish language lines spoken in the film are not just quotes from the book, they were derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's own limited dictionary of that language. Dialect coach Andrew Jack used actual recordings of Tolkien reading his books to guide the actors' pronunciation.
And yet Gandalf won't admit that Radagast exists.
Also, you killed a lot of innocent japs for no reason.
It says Has anyone ever been as far as to go even to do look more like?
10GANDALF OH SHIT HERE WE GO
He exploded, then exploded again!
>inb4 not an allegory until overanalyzed
4No no
Ron_Weasley is hax0rz
4I will not attempt to stall you all
3Bjornfot, WW2 would have ended without the US, but then Europe would be Communist
4I have exposition to give, so watch the film
Sauron = Voldemort?
thats common knowledge, Gimli
oshi- politics
A Ninja Sam has appeared!
10legolas YFW Battle of Britain
3But other than that, yeah
wouldnt it be easier
sauron= discord
to have like
What Azz speaks is true, even Tolkein said Tom could stop Sauron if he felt like it, but he didn't because he was a troll.
11Still random trivia, isn't it?
a team of hobbits
really quiet for anyone else?
We'll put it away!
Voldemort?
0bjornfo, they would have kept coming if we hadnt dropped the bombs
He rebuilt his castle. It didn't help that we forgot to station anyone in there to watch for these things, but that's besides the point. :D
in the same place that lost socks go
and its sort of like a relay race to mordor
0bjornfot*
that way no one gets addicted to it
No Legolas. The world would have been better off without your... "interference". It's true for everything, even today.
4Well
0@gandalf gloriousexpositioncomrade.jpg
Which means Frodo wears the Dark Lord around his neck for three movies?
3Ron_Weasley Oh I know, but defense doesn't invade normandy
>implying Russian forces would have taken over all of Europe... lol
4Yeah, sorry for not telling you, Frodo. My bad?
yfw Tolkien actually considered making languages a hobby, and made Elven and many derivations with full vocabulary and grammar, enough to enable him to speak it
Samwise really came into his own awesomeness during the later parts of the second movie and the third movie.
3Bjornfot Well...after WWII...yeah we fucked up
well, at least all of germany
10Yeah but Britain wasn't lost. Mainland Europe was, and they're all rubbish anyway ;)
Don't come and say that eg Hiroshima did any good.
How astute, frodo
I can't evolve Graveler into Gollum.
meanwhile in new jearsey
But thats where I live!
Breaking News: Hilter's zombie has sued Tolkein's zombie

FRodo has LEVERAGE!
NOW ARE U OUT OF YOUR MIND FRODO THET'LL KILL ME GOOD LUCK THO
4I would like to remain single, Frodo
Sucks to be Gollum.
It's not a cock ring, Gandalf. How is this tempting?
14lol Gandalf

and im going to crap myself arent i
Bravely Frodo ran away...
Brit here too
3Bjornfot, no hiroshima was horrible...but it also let the world know what nukes could do, making sure the cold war never became hot...
0eventually it would be taken like the rest of Europe
.m
No Thetrollside, USA did almost nothing compared to every other country. They did like, 20% of nazi casualties.
oh brave sir frodo

SECRET BUTT FUN
Ninja gardener!
3Bjornfot perhaps.
ponyyyyyy
Yes. Sam the pony!
8HE DRIVES ME TO SMOKE PIPEWEED
SPOILER: It's because you are horrible-
sex slave
1. Forced into certain death adventure
4Unfortunately, Peter Jackson didn't like my "better use" so we went with his
2. Become best character
10xD
:D is m face when I pony
3. ???
giggidy
4. Profit
Oddly, Gandalf's best decision ever...
3But wouldn't you rather have both the US and USSR know what nuclear weapons could actually do?
yup. Samwise saves the world.
It's funny because Sir Ian is gay.
gandalf is a mary sue
Yes, ARE. You had nothing to do in the middle-east either. Bush only went in there for the oil.
Best, Sidekick, Ever.
5. Endure implied homosexualism for eternity
3Bjornfot I don't doubt that.
lol@politics flamewar
bodyguards are too mainstream
It's gay because Sir Ian is fun.
By 'Sidekick', you of course mean 'Lover'
im taking my gardener
0This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
no its not
10lol odin
4mfw There are two conversations taking place in the chat
0@bjornfot, bush was a retard but atleast not as bad as obama
its your dirty pony minds
brokeback mount doom
it's dangerous to go alone, take your gardener
inb4 incredulous Ho-Yay scene
Enjoying it a lot, Odin?
wait
Srsly guys, this is manly shit
What, you counted, Sam?
push him
4@Odin: You haven't seen homoerotic until the third film
he remembers his EXACT step?!
8<Odin>: This movie is a lot more homoerotic than I remember...
It's really just that those two look like they should be-- but they aren't.
Why does everybody insists on seeing sex everywhere?
0I know
8i lol'd
homosex exists because of Sir Ian. He's like Dracula.
3Bjornfot I think we never should have gone into either
11RANDOM CORNFIELD TRIVIA: On the film's first theatrical release, a story circulated (and was reported in the goofs section) that when Sam tells Frodo that he is now the farthest he has ever been from home, a car is visible driving by in the background (top-right corner of the screen). Arguments ensued. Some said it was smoke from a chimney
11thers said they saw the glint of sunlight reflected from the windscreen of a fast-moving vehicle. In the version of the film released on DVD there is definitely no car, only chimney smoke and a one-frame flash of light that could conceivably be a car, but not in any sense that could be considered a goof.
lol, he saw the line he drew around the shire
To be fair, there is a scarecrow
Both democratics and republicans are retards, thetrollside. Has USA ever heard of Libertarianism?
Suddenly Ian Holm voiceover
LOOK OUT , THERE ARE POKEMON IN THE TALL GRASS
Ponies are about 20% manlier than LOTR
DONT GO PAST THIS lINE OR Ill BE OUT OF THE SHIRE
3Bjornfot But to say we should have known is hindsight blindness
This is starting to sound like one of those dumbass arguments they have on /b/ over which country is the best.
It sounded like he said "Remember what dildo used to say!"
"It's dangerous business going out your door". I need to read that fic.
Is it still clever to say Dildo instead of Bilbo?
7EQD hates us?
Equestria is the best country, obviously.
4Celine Dion is among them
"Let's go take nekkid pictures and put them on the hobbitnet!"
not really
SUDDENLY
ELVES
hobbitchan
8confound this sethisto
>yfw Celine Dion is french canadian
FORESHADOWING
10we've got 119 without EqD?
3*Ahem* Elves are definitely awesome.
10Fucking win
Ersatz: do yourself a favor and read it, then ignore the last three of four chapters
Well Europeans allowed Hitler to do what he f*cking wants because the were afraid of the new world war and thus digged own grave.
Elves look more like ghosts...
mom keeps calling him dildo cause she thinks its funny and origional
you can tell they're elves because they naturally emit bloom
Douche baggins.
Thats no root
thats because the ELVES are in sad mode right now
oh my god
then they look like ghosts
induring random nationalism
Sam, that was very gay
Have Merry and Pippin come in yet?
look at that bloom effect
nope
I see WHY they cut these scenes from the theatrical cut
You could have tested it on something better than a HUGE CITY FULL OF PEOPLE
"Dirty gray root." Is that what Gandalf calls it?
but hitler gave us free cars lol
thats so realistic
Elves are tall, blonde, blue eyed whites. Oh Tolkien
4Still no post?
they should work for infinity ward
8nope
Elves are self-righteous putzes
blonde?
3Bjornfot like what?
eeeenope
Can't imagine why this critical scene about Sam's inability to get to sleep wasn't kept in the original cut.
@Bjornfot,stop hatin' on the US.It only makes them angry.
4I do believe Starbuck made a joke
8i emailed him about 15 minutes ago
dat nightmare
DAT HORSE
Roses are gray, Gandalf is too, But then he's white, and i'm confused
>yfw Tolkien wrote the books before Nazis came along
Elves are like vulcans with more rage.
Bjornfot is a mmmmbitch who likes bananas?
4Faster, Big Macintosh!
elves eat their own dead
Yes, Gandalf. And it was hilarious.
in b4 BEST WIZARD
even their horses are evil.
BANANAS
SARUMAN
send him to the moon
inb4 the adventure becomes so extreme the yreplace pillows with rocks because they feel more comfy
your voice is awesome
Dat score
>yfw This is fantasy
You can tell just by the design of that tower that it's evil.
To Isengard?
That's a very evil looking tower
3Pegacorn I am not angry man. I love participating in a good debate.
0bjornfot: ok lets say we didnt drop the bombs on the japs and they kept comming....
The grrrrrreat and poweeeerrrrrful Saruman
I'm not hating on US citizens, or even the country itself. I'm hating on their leaders, mostly.
Hi Ian!
ive been spending too much time on the internet
NO, IT"S CAPTAIN PLANET
4I admit, he's currently higher level than I
0comeing*
i expected him to say "smoke weed erryday"
0coming
0w/e
4I am not pleased by that, of course
Tim Curry would be terrifying
Jeremy Irons would have been hilarious, but the funny would ruin the movie
11> Tim Curry
count douku
Saruman. It's like a stereotypical Asian saying "Slenderman."
4He doesn't know that I urinate in his drink
11He would fucking scare me
Tim Curry as Saruman?
Sean Connery should have been Gandalf
I dunno, I gladly hate on the US media.
8>you get high too much gandalf
:D
13You're just mad that I'm better than you Gandalf
Rob Zombie would totally make a great Lords of the Rings remake.
wait
suddenly me is someone
I drank 3 cups of coffee and it's 1:47AM, but i'm starting to feel a bit hazy and the film technically hasn't started yet. :/
thetrollside: then kill every single retard who comes to you. BUT DON'T EVER TOUCH CIVILIANS
Saru'n'Furter
if they're wizards
4What is going on?
where are their hats
if I was a wizard, building a huge tower to compensate would be exactly what I'd do
GLADLY!
Likewise, Elky.
No EQD hit yet?
4Saruman?!
^Already posted
Well, anything you can do, Gandalf can do better
id build a huge tower
Hell, just building huge towers in general is what I'd do.
4We do not have much time!
13Gandalf.
EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
Was this eye ever in the book?
RanYakumo: lolno
That post isn't new
Sauron is Big Brother
learn an anti gravity spell
I would litter the landscape with pointlessly huge towers.
an army of fanboys
and just jump off it daily
has there ever been a lotr musical?
3Bjornfot If we hadn't known just how horrible of destruction a nuke could cause to a city, would the US or USSR hesitate to use one?
8i dunno
Do you have to write the date more than 6 times a day?
LEVERAGE!
13No we don't!
RanYakumo, chen was here
A SPHERE
I remember how in the books, Saruman started wearing a robe with all the colors in the rainbow, signifying how he wasn't Saruman the White anymore.
4But why, Saruman, why use his tool?
imagine peoples faces when they see me jumping off my huge tower
Nerds . . .
Once Ron Paul gets elected, I'm building a pointlessly high tower.
just to float safely to the bottom
Legolas, neither would probably have cared.
eeveesprit That silly girl! Where has she gotten off to now?
>inb4 epic old man fight
3Bjornfot Exactly.
love how after two doors gandalf doesn't get that sauruman's gonna keep clising
4Okay, dude, what the hell?
Get the point?
RanYakumo, she went drinking with suika

Gimli: Wow, that is awesome
he could read new, possible better books

4Oh, you bastard
All the wizards have beards
Count Dooku used the force
inb4 awsome fight
Gandalf, you fool! No one who rolls their 'r's that hard can be a good guy!
3Bjornfot And how would that turn out...I am thinking fallout 1-3 style
Your point being, Legolas?
uh, if you're a wizard, can't you just teleport yourself out of the tower
13Bwahahaha.
BANANAS
0>thisisrelevanttoodinsinterests
or even better
These wizzard fights totaly beat the crap out of the potter ones.
Saruman is Twilight Sparkle

Ah, two old guys beating the crap out of each other.
11inb4 Gandalf Did I Mention is a meme
3Bjornfot If we hadn't used the nuke in war and learned its true devastation, then the US or USSR might have used one against the other(Because neither would have known the power of one) and the world would enter WWIII
OHNO NYX IS HERE
Dat Green Screen effect
he became gandalf the hite now right?
WE NEED MORE BALROG
In a corn field?

Fun fact: In the theatrical version of this scene, you could see a car passing behind in the background.
Hi, Nyx
Whoopsie, silly browser.
Nyx loves Harry Potter... >:(
He doesn't become Gandalf the White until he defeats the Balrog.

Legolas: The US and USSR bombing each other to pieces would have ben good for the rest of the world.

not really...
Cars exist in New Zealand?
COMEDY!
This is the part where they meet the Scarecrow. If he only had a brain.
slapstick
GERROUT 'O' MOI FIELD
These guys suck
IMHO: first three Harry Potter movies = God Tier, rest of movies = meh, books = even more meh
If only THEY had brains.
Bjornfot: so a bunch of innocent people who dont give a crap about it get killed?
Hobbitroll'd
Sam is a little bit slow, isn't he?
actually
yeah that sounds fantastic
my carrot!
No radagast, it was actually a sheep.
I liked HP 3 the best myself
he broke his carrot -gasp-
i liked the 6 Harry Potter movie the most
Alfonso Cuaron is a genius
Could that fucking INTERNET WANNABE HISTORIANS BULLSHIT ABOUT WORLD FUCKING BRAWL TWO AND A HALF STOP?
Shortcut to PAIN
I was under the impression that they didn't actually have to change anything to film this in New Zealand.
like the 6th one
he broke his dorty white root
Shrooms. :o
14Shrooms!
SHROOOOOOOOOOMS
MUSHROOM SHORTCUTS ARE THE BEST SHORTCUTS.
oh man
shrooms
mushrooooooms...
I'm glad that carrot isn't a metaphor for anything.
The fourth Harry Potter movie was best
harry potter 2 was awesome
Better than the book
the books are good for what they do
I read the harry potter books but saw no movies
BADGER BADGER BADGER
but the hp movies... bah.
shrooms...
I feel like such a twilight
I agree i=with Rezo
Nyx o you
SNAKE
1 to 4 was best, the rest was meh
Ominous wailing
i think they were all pretty meh
I think I only saw the first four HP movies. =/

Gimil: Wasn't Sean Connery at one point considered for Gandalf?
3Rezo, your right Bjornfot, we can continue to debate in PM
this is why tree is Tom bombadil

Meanie*
sean connery as gandalf?
IT'S NIGHTMARE MOON
And hey, didn't say the Harry Potter duels were BAD. I just like Saruman and Gandalf's duel way more. Bitches knock each other with telekinesis. I wish I could do that. :(
the best scene in all of the Harry Potter movies, without competition, is the story of the deathly hallows in 7
death?
Why hello there post-Cupcakes Pinkie Pie.
Death eaters?
Discord is revived as an aliconr filly
0WHATSSSSSSSSSS GOIN ON
Sean Connery as Gandalf

his chest hair would defeat sauron in the first scene...
Peter jackson bugs scene: Oh You
Thus Nyx is born, and suddenly everyone hates wachother
Nazgul gave up "Seeing hobbits in front of you" in order to take the "Glowing horse eyes" feat
i actually tried reading these books, i couldnt because i have a terrible attention span and reading several hundred pages of "they walked a lot and complained about food" isn't really interesting to me
i just came
dks are so overpowered
White wizard shtanding by
Frodo...... don't wear the ring
I don't see how this'd work
MUSHROOMSSSSSS
He can sense the dramatic tension!
Rezo Yeah, besides the whole "forsaking your soul" part, it'd be pretty cool.
I can live with that
My Gods, that would be a useful power to have in real life.
that sounded like a distraction, I better go check it out
"Whatever it was, it was pretty stupid."

fone was cherry picker guy
wow
Nyx isn't afraid of the dark.Or it's GODDAMN ANNOYING PIECE OF SHIT TRAILERS THAT KEEP INTERRUPTING MY VIEWINGS OF FAMILY GUY BETWEEN SCENES!
Peter Jackson made this, then where are the T-Rexs and giant gorilla?
id stab people in the ass so they grab their ass in pain every time im near them
Fuck Tom Bombadil
lol pegacorn
and then laugh at them being butthurt
he ruined the books
Radagast: they're not until two Towers
tom bombadil is the chapter I always skip

RANDOM PETER JACKSON TRIVIA: He actually was in Pre-Production for King Kong BEFORE he made LOTR, but his original King Kong movie, called "KONG", got cancelled, then he did LOTR
Haven't they already left?
0Good night emmett
too scary, gonna go watch pnies.
Inception horn!
11RANDOM FERRY TRIVIA: In one take of the Bucklebury Ferry scene, Elijah Wood overshot his jump and ended up in the river instead of on the Ferry.
tom bombadil could duplicate the ring and give it to everyone
well technically
King Kong is the better movie, soely because it has Adrien Brody
lmao
this is a pony
lawl Gimli
its just a scary ass pony
nah
to the boat!
Bombadil was a character that JRRT had made for the world-myth, and later added to the book to show that somethings were just plain not explicable.
Is that a win or a fail?
King Kong's biggest problem though was that it was SO GODDAMN LONG
King Kong is just an "ok" movie
GET TO THE BOOOAATT
DSN: not soley, it's awesome for lots of reasons
But it also has Jack Black
Its one of the ponies from Sunny Town
Adrien Brody is awesome, though
get to the choppa!

QUICK TIME EVENT UPCOMING
King Kong was bad.
BTW,if my all caps rage wasn't a big enough clue,i think Don't be afraid of the dark is the most annoying movie of 2011.
i always get peter jackson confused with sam raimi. idk why
The LOTR movies are some of the very best
movies with chuck norris in ti where legendary
EVER
So, would the Nazgul's horses be the Shadowbolts then?
Lord of the rings is "Ambitious,but rubbish
I really liked KK, but the first HOUR is mostly filler
I remember the butthurt among the tolkien taliban when tom bombadil wasn't in the film
Can't they just swim?
btw, Adrien Brody is my favorite actor
Ringwraiths can't cross water
11RANDOM FERRY TRIVIA: During one take of the Buckleberry Ferry scene, a very strong splinter found its way through Dominic Monaghan's prosthetic foot and into his own causing him considerable pain. While crew members took the splinter out of his foot, Monaghan bragged to his fellow hobbits as to how large the splinter would be,
11 but it ended up being very small. From that point on Billy Boyd would tease him about splinters whenever something happened to Dominic, much to Dominic's frustration.
King Kong was pedantic.
they cant cross water
STAY BACK SUNNY TOWN PONY! STAND BACK!
was long typical peter jackson
"I knew I should have brought the crossbow"

Length is overrated. If movie critics can seriously give a movie a bad review because it was long, then that goes to show you how awful the critics of our generation are.
FRODO'S A BRONY
and dirtbike camera shots abound
he did
Samwise, there's a difference between long movie
11They should have gotten Michael Bay to direct. *trollface*
>implying critics were ever good
Dat_Pon-3 we already watched the 2nd and 3rd
and endless filler
We should watch Evil Dead 2 or ARMY OF DARKNESS!
HEY
On the note of King Kong: SKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL! SKULL! IT SAYS SKULL!
dont mob Michael Bay
Suddenly there was a massive explosion!
hes an awesome director
You should read the initial critics for films like, say, the Terminator. It's laughable.
My Little Hobbits: Fellowship is Magic?
Dermathil Awwww, really?
7already did
4@Rodman: We already did
already happend rodman!
Already watched Army of Darkness
>yfw Twilight Sparkle is on the sign in front of the inn
Rezo: watch some Siskel and Ebert filly
Rodman: It's been done
4We watched both films
HEY EVERYPONY
If michael bay directed this bag end would've blown up in the first 5 minutes
Pony :D
yeah Rodman. Ghosties chose them both
Hey pony
Awwww
We should watch Space Jam
OH WELL!
thats true, Meanwhile
7already did
into the prancing pony we go
michael bay directing this, EXPlODING SWORDS
really i found out about bronystate when you guys showed the room thats when i joined
hey Ponymensch
Not necessarrily. Ever watch Drag Me To Hell? All the Evil Dead goofiness without Ash.
but Michael Bay wouldnt want to direct LOTR, anyways
we should watch the room
Meanwhile Probably the Shire.
I heard theres a hot furry girl in space jam
Ebert absolutely hated Once Upon a Time in the West when it was released. So yeah.
My point stands
Ponymensch YOU ARE GERMAN?
Roger Ebert is a windbag
>mfw people recommending movies we already watched.
Jackson cameo coming up I think
Michael Bay Presents: RING
4...I suddenly have the desire to play KOTOR
0Dat accent
eeveesprit nope
oh look DSNesmith
Lola Bunny is hotter in that new Looney Tunes cartoon
Riders: I love that movie, but it never felt like an Evil Dead movie like everyone says.
Ponymensch good
oh hai bjornfot
he's busy playing magicka
11RANDOM CAMEO TRIVIA: Peter Jackson: As the belching peasant, outside the Prancing Pony Inn in Bree.
The ringwraith horses would've had flame decals
Elky: Die.
Evil Dead was fucking scary....
Damn it, Gh-Gandalf, why'd you have to say that?
Stay there and drink obviously.
Drink and be Merry!
I want that ferret.
Michael Bay ruins anything and errything he touches.
I miss that game.
Elky, don'tcha remember? First movie the movie nights ever streamed!
not true
4Yeah, sorry about that Frodo. I was in a dancing contest with Saruman and we decided to do SUDDEN DEATH
evil dead was mind f**k
Michael Bay is a good director
I love Jackson's cameo in Two Towers
a point
I need to continue that game
0The barkeep sounds like my grandfather, kinda
My cat!
EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN PINTS
however, some of his script writers suck...
Michael Bay sucks.
We should watch The Rock so I can laugh when everyone likes the movie.
OMG OFFICIAL ST
Actually, my cat has short hair.
>The game
11RANDOM PERSPECTIVE TRIVIA: Some of the customers in the Prancing Pony are walking around on stilts to emphasize the height disparity with the Hobbits.
this place looks like east cleveland
Michael Bay rocks
We SHOULD watch Dead Alive, Peter Jackson's best movie.
... hard to judge whether counter sarcasm
Corner stalker.
4Yes, point at the guy who's been staring at you
Dat EqD completely forgetting about us
eeveesprit What do you mean good? I come from German/Austrian/English/Scotch Descent!
dem stilts.
4Not stupid at all
Gandalf = Why KotOR, specifically?
Michael Bay is one of the best directors out there
Rangers be rangin'.
I want a Cute Ferret
Ranger
STRIDERS!
rangers gonna range
/me starts playing Shadow's theme from FF6.
4Strider Hiryu?
Michael Bay is a dipshit.
It always bugged me that Sam calls him Strider for the entire series
clearly ezio
But we all know he multi-classes
Pegacorn The Rock was alright. Other than that...
Michael Bay is awesome
OH YEAH
i wanna play Skyrim right now so badly
4I dunno, Riders. Probably because people were talking about it earlier
durger why
WHY
rangers? i wonder if there's one called hunter or khan
So next weekend, Transformers trilogy?
BLAST YOUR ASS OFF, ASSHOLES
Michael Bay better not touch fim
Michael Bay made me regret being a fan of Transformers.
did you do that to me
i dunno lol
arrrgh
THE RING DESIRES TO CONSUME BEER
Ponymensch sorry there was a discusion about WWII my grandma died there by german people
Back-itch
He's a ranger, that's why he uses a broadsword. Problem, RPG norms?
Since everyone is talking about how awesome Michael Bay is
way to stay undercover, you idiot
Michael Bay made the best thing ever to come out of the Transformers franchise
Fool of a took
...
And the idiots strike again!
oh snap
!
4@CriticKitten: He's the king, so he can cross class
UUUUUH
i dont know why a complaint in tranformers is too many explosions
Fucking magnets.

and then cloak ran out
MWAHAHAHAHAH
Nice meanwhile
eeveesprit Well that's okay. My grandfather fought in WWII. My german descent is pre-WWII
ceiling Sauron is seeing you clop
Michael Bay owned Uwe Boll, he's cool in my book.
Meester Baggins!
And we thought Nightmare Moon's eyes were disturbing.
Did it start early?
Michael Bay movies aren't good but they are fun. Except for Transformers
LotR
Indeed.
4Well, we are all the primary protagonists
let's do this
The characters in this movie laugh at your silly classes
watched this movie so many times
4So we're exceptional
lawl
Michael Bay is what Adrien Brody will look like in 15 years.
damn Viggo's the man
Yeah right, Viggo being unnoticed...
good suggestion
Clearly. :D
Fists versus sword.
Longshanks!
frodo "im horny" sauron: dont you think about you hairy lil freak
I wish I knew other good movies he's in
Someone at school said Transformers 3 is one of the best movies he's ever seen.
because all the ones I've seen him in were terrible
TIME TO KILL OFF ANOTHER TOKEN CHARACTER

Russell Crowe is a good actor, but he isn't right for the role.
movie over!
Honestly, Platinum Dunes pisses me off far more than Transformers.
The End, Goooodnight everybody
overkill much?
CriticKitten, I did. Many times. He said I had no taste in movies.
Transformers 3 left me confused instead off pissed like I was in Transform 2. IMPROVEMENT

Happy to bring about the giggles Boromir.
Sauron the Deceiver? How many titles does Sauron have?
Agreed Samwise
that's the bro from The Butterfly Circus btw
Where's Hipster? Or who?
0I didn't know whether we would have to deal with this through fisticuffs, gandalf
ring wraiths sound rather like shadow ships
Well we didn't find him in that one room, so let's not search the rest of the town
mobileDCD who?
Nazgul: Neither living nor dead.
Transformers 2 isnt better than 3
So they're Liches?
Everyone's being a hipster right now, really. Take your pick. :P
lol Samwise,but 2 is the worst
Sauron the sexy?
ofc its no problem
Rodman You could say that.
transformers 3 was the worst movie I ever watchedin cinema, and possibly of all time
Hipster_Brony
its my opinion, asshole
Nazgul = Michael Jackson
4Odin, my boy, a wizard does not dare fight with his fists. He fights with his will
Elky, you haven't seen Wicker Man?
Great. they can detect the RIng. Nazgul have their own Pinkie Sense.

@lemonloaf: They don't just eat, they smoke and drink too. Didn't you hear Bilbo? :p
oh no, not again
AND BURNING TOAST IS SERIOUS SHIT!
Wait, don't they use those swamps later in the Two Towers?
Michael Bay would not want to direct LOTR

Michael Bay can't direct LOTR since he couldn't use black sterotypes.
Gimli sure, they're all farmers

health experts must have a lot of time on their hands

Michael Bay uses black stereotypes?
We are Spazturtle? I thought it was less.
I'M GONNA GET STAN LEE'S AUTOGRAPH!
Radagast: Are you implying the orcs aren't a black stereotype?
lol
I AM BAWS
Radagast, easy fix, just have a couple of jive-talking Nazgul
he would have orcs be the steriotypes Radagast
4Well then, it would appear that we have come to an agreement of sorts
0But, Gimil, is it known how much Hobbits eat in those meals?
LOL RACISM?!?!?!"§)"=$

there is absolutely NO WAY that killing the trees will bite me in the ass, right? RIGHT?
Saruman got an echo within his echo

His crowning achievement was making Dutch.
Dutch should be in every movie in existence. It'd make them at the very least 20% cooler

Detroit looks a lot better in this movie
14Just listen to our bakcground music!
why robert rodriguez makes these movies I'll never understand
And now you all know how orcs are born.
11RANDOM WHISPERS TRIVIA: One of the indistinct words that Gandalf whispers to the moth when he is trapped by Saruman is "Gwaihir", the name of the eagle that later rescues him from the tower.
Gandalf is breton
This is my fetish
its off to work we go

That's how orcs are made, dear boy
URUK-HAI

They're all getting mud baths.
These didn't bake ling enough.

there kips of the mud
when a mommy orc and a daddy orc love eachothr...

0Who here plays LOTRO?
The goblin word for goblin is orc.

No wonder the Nazgul are so pissed off
WHO WOULD WIN A FIGHT? A BALROG OR A MASSIVE SWARM OF PARASPRITES?
Trolls loophole > Eagles Loophole
The movie based games are alright but I'll stick with Dragon Age. The best Lord of the Rings game never made.
Pinkamena
Samwise, easy choice
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
Uruk Hai
pinkie
how do they know they are the same trolls?
Hands down
YAAAAAAAAAAY

Gotta watch out, when Frodo reaches the shadow realm, they'll probably force him into a children's card game

Fun fact: the guy who translated all the Elvish in this movie went to UW-Madison.
She's an elf

themarewhoarrangestheblocks lol
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Cate Blanchett joked that she took the role of Galadriel because, "I've always wanted pointy ears".
Lmao
And here she exaplins, in High Elven, "Shortie, you are screwed."
...and learned his Elvish there.

And now they'll do some padlockigami
samwise, her name is fluttershy
@Sotha: Clearly. Swords are useless where cards are involved. The wraith's horses are just the medieval version of cards games on motorcycles
We need a brony sword.

11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Pregnancy changed Peter Jackson's vision of "Lord of the Rings". Originally, he wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel and Uma Thurman as Arwen. Unfortunately, both actresses became pregnant after being asked to read, and the roles were filled in by Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, respectively.
live free or ride hard
3*clop*
these landscape shots are so amazing...
This movie just got 20% cooler
NuqDeh
Would an elf ride Rarity?
12Ad blocker is basic add-on. Everyone should have some version to it.
....
Wait
we could have had UMA THURMAN as Arwen!?
Nostalgia Critic > Nostalgia Chick.
nc rubs the fact she's a liberal in everyone's face
What
I'd ride Rarity
Ghosties!
0Gandalf was a spy!
ulma thurman as arwen would be sxy
giggity
hands off rarity
4Yes, I'm here
Rarity wouldn't let anyone ride her
Lol
little miss gamer is just adorable
drag races of the old middle earth
I really prefer Liv and Cate.
But she's generous
Oh yeah we can ride her
4OH SHIT, IT'S EOWYN
filthy scoundrels
Rairty rides EVERYPONY
If any pony was to let someone ride them, it'd be Pinkie pie
4FUUUUUUUUUUUU
mare: I like Uma Thurman, but no
10Ghosties is red spy
surely she'd let arwen ride her to safe frodo
Elky Except Prince Blueblood (before she met him at the gala).
or twilight
I'd let Rarity ride me
Just because she agrees to everyone.
....
"give me this?"
Lawl
14Betches best respect!
of course
0>elf riding rarity
did I miss something, ghosties?
:P
Needs more tilty Battlefield Earth cameras
Doesn't Twilight let Spike ride her?
0>kinky
0Ron_Weasley is Ginger Blue Spy!
yep
Giggity.
Twilight did
Lolol
once or twice
Radagast, agreed
Haw haw
yeah, but spike is underage
10so we gained like 30 new viewers from that post lol
oh god
yeah screeching
4Well you missed a good portion of the film, FluxBrony
One with a bit too, I think.
Spike, yusogiggolo?
3*Ahem* Elves dress the best...dontcha know?
4If you just arrived
10Razyn I resent that/
I just arrived. 3;
I threw Rarity into a hole.She was whinning WAAAAAAAAAAY too much.
10.*
Arwen always dresses in style
inb4 awsome scene
and now Arwen is Glorfindel too
the best part is moria anyways
Imagine if someone tried to adapt Lord of the Rings to modern times.
Elves don't dress as well as Rainbow Dash
Lolz
When I visited France I bought Battlefield earth for 50cents... Felt like I got ripped off.
NOW
MAGIC TIME
Not whining. Complaining.
3Therefore obviously Rarity would let us ride.
Riverowned
BITCHES
Water. My one true weakness
geez these things scream like re deads from zelda
Wraiths don't know bout my running water
TASTE THE RAINBOW
BUT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED WHINIIIING
ghosties no, i've seen this before, is this the extended version?
MOTHERFUCKER
Wasn't this suppose to start just 20 minutes ago? It feels like it is a lot further into the film
Considering how old dragons get, Spike will be under age for a looooooong time
I would facepalm
Water! Nazgul can't cross water! Or is that vampires?
If you want him, you need to be 20% faster

Bird-thing>Gravity
Y U NO just fly bird to Mordor?
oh its one of the eagles you could have used to FlY TO MORDOR
*rolls eyes*
OH SHIT SON
And this is where Radagast redeems himself and saves Gandalf.
10Gandalf = Batman is now canon
Thyere is one Lord of the Ring... Only o0ne... and he does not share cupcakes.
"Someone might've died!"
So why did they not fly to mordor?
HOW MUCH HAVE I MISSED
oh nothing
FRODO?!??!?!?!!?
Gilda is not an eagle
Samwise, because Gandalf is an idito.
Suddenly sam
Y U NO FLY TO MORDOR
4I had to eat my bird on the way here, it was quite gamey
One does not simply qwop into mordor
speaking of Batman
one does not simply fly into mordor!
Sam was watching you sleep
The eagles are afraid of mordor
Extreme plothole there
the new gandalf was ghostlies first
4Mr. Baggins
3And counting
what are you guys thinking of Batman Begins?
that's why they don't go
one does not simply qwop at all
In the book, Gandalf was actually saved by Rainbow Dash, but Peter Jackson hates ponies.
0Hey
SUDDENLY AGENT SMITH
@samwise then that eagle is her mom
MR Anderson
One does not simply clop into mordor
Mr Anderson
It's Agent Smith.
One does not simply fly into Mordor
One does note simply ROCK into Mordor!
Agent Smith.
one does not simply clop into ponies
P.S.: They can't use the Eagles because they Eagles are not part of the current war. It's complicated but self-consistent.
WhatPayne because, they um well...
Hi Agent Smith
xD
You can't fly over mordor, that air is all ashy and shit
That Hugo Weaving.
Peter Jackson Y U NO RADAGAST
So many people saying the same thing...

The herdmind is strong
Yes.
0How many favors does gandalf owe the eagle king now?
That was pretty gay, but I can still count the gay Sam moments on just one hand as of now.
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY X INTO MORDOR. Because it's NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
One does not simply fly into mordor, because the ash clouds clog the wings.
gay
10just fyi anyway
Its like another 2 hours till the pony episode, right?
Comments are more interesting than the video

Strider is the ranger

pinkie is amazing
GoldMerc@_ is right... probably.
Gah
Pinkie Pie has control over the worlds beyond worlds
0Most likely...
Pinkie Pie is the best pie.
@goldmerc2_ pinkie's not a magician. she's a reality bender.
GoldMerc2_
pinkie pie would just break the fourth wall and beat sauron
4Except Trixie, of course
7the download came with 2 files
the grrreat and powerful trrrrrrrrixxxie is best magician
PINKIE PIE!... PINKIE PIE!... PINKIE PIE!

They got it at a tattoo parlor in Wellington, New Zealand, to commemorate the experience of the movie. The ninth member, John Rhys-Davies, declined and sent his stunt double in his place.

When you're eating chips and salsa do you prefer the salsa to be cold or hot?
Jesus. I didn't know that these movies were that long
I think Flutterguy was cool if only for the novelty of ISSAC HAYES voicing a character.
Lord of the Rings: Return of the Fellowship of the Two Towers and Equestrain Girls

One does not simply walk into Mordicai
IT'S MORE FUN WHEN YOU GOT PONY TALK
yeah nathandash
Left, frodo

Hi
bad pun nathandash
"Left, Frodo."
I'd wonder how a non brony found us
so about an hour left in the movie?
4One does not simply Mordor into walk...
lol
nathandash is overcompensating
There's a non-brony here?
oh heck yes, got the chat next to the movie!
no i mean right
One does not simply walk into mirrors (trust me, I've tried)
I think 2 more hours
THIS IS LOOKING PROMiSING SO FAR
interior_gummy about 2 now
CriticKitten: *brohoof*
was it left?
0Bronies who are fans of LOTR = Boromies
HEH HEH
NEIGHSAYERS IN THE CHAT.

11One does not simply Direction into Mordor
what's a 'non-brony'?

@meanwhile actually i invite some every now and then
WELCOME TO THE HERD
But, two can walk into Mordor, no problem
boromies ftw!
One does not simply . . . Oh nevermind.
...

Boromies? k
3Odin Some good ad-libbing there.
There are Bronies in here?
dispatchrabbi *brohoof*
@meanwhile more for the movie than the people but occasionally they decide to start watching the show
One question
seriously gandalf now would be a great time to mention the eagle
And nine it's a pi8ece fom cake.
One does not easily transport onself into the location known as "Mordor"!
inb4 epic sideshow
MAAAAAAAAAAAIN THEEEEEEEEEEEEEME
it premiers on a saturday? Well... thats odd.
bronies? in my epic saga? it's more likely than you think.
One does not simply verb into location.
How many wizards ARE there?
LOL SO THE HOBBITS RIDE PONIES INSTEAD OF HORSES RIGHT?
IS THERE ANY NONE BORNY HERE?
/me 11wonders how One Does Not Simply would be Gentleman-fied
yes i'm a bronie
when did the movie start?
7my ears are killing me now
I got Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi. I feel like a pussy
bah bah bahahabahb4
perhaps one day the world shall be bronies
fuck the eagles
Power walk!
BOROMIES
4One does not simply walk into Red Mountain. The Lord Dagoth lingers there
WHAT IF ONE HAD APPLEJACK
YES
Music boom~
wait, which ahrry potter film is this?
I have to admit, even without the ponies, I would still watch it for the free movies
What about complexly walking into Mordor?
so is sam
Leads fellowship of warriors into forbidden land to save world. "Which way do I go?"
Mmmm, listen to that theme!
Outside of Gandalf and Saruman, that is
EPIC MUSIC

frodo needs to kill some bitches
RD could have done the whole journey in 10 seconds flat
Well, bill there is a pony
traveling never been so epic
Me too, what an coincidence....
Morrowindface.
One does not simply walk over the swayback mountains.

7? isnt it like 178 minutes?
They should replace this theme with the MLP them :D

THIS IS GONNA LOOK GOOD IN THE TRAILER!
This is the theme that sold it
Dat Land scape
epic music, not gonna lie
3BUUUUUU-BUUUUU BU BU BUMMMMM
4Oh yeah, eagles and shit
Do we watch the pony episodes after this?
11That Main Theme
one does not simply become a brony by watching FiM..... no, wait, that's actually how it happens...
8DAT EPIC MUSIC
One does not simply TROT into THE EVERFREE FOREST!
4Woo
BRONIES WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!! HAHAHA.... I MEAN..... FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC!
0ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY MONTAGE INTO MORDOR
One does not simply trot into Equestria

I need to visit New Zealand someday.
Well, as long as they can get through the Temple of Elemental Evil...

PROTECT THIS NON-SPECIFIC SPOT BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO.
I love how the movie totally reverses Gandalf's view of Moria
moria....
Moria, that place is so dead...
I think I just puked in my mouth a little
that will be fun
The Sixth House was wayy less fearsome than Mordor's terrors.
3*pffft* Dwarves...always COMPLAINING....
bird thingies
They can say hi to the daimond dogs while they're down there
4Translation: No Gimli. Dwarves suck and stink LOL
Yeah, srsly guyz, I'm the guy who broke my axe on the ring. Why is no one listening to me for advice?!?
BEAT HIM UP
I didn't hear of anyone who isn't a brony here. Perhaps they will be after the night is through.

14Yeah. When you've got acouple hundred people, things are bound to get fast. :P

hi ghosties
10I'm not trying to guilt you into staying, I'm just saying I'm shocked it was so sudden
he fell into equestria
at least we have ghosties back
4Oh, dammit
uh-uh
8and i know its not the best timing, but i feel like running it without any passion or enthusiasm will be just as bad
0he is gone... FOREVER
Ohey Ghosties. You were gone?
nice one, ghosties
10>.>
GHOSTIES YOU MISSED GANDALFS DEATH!!!
Gandalf is saved by Rainbow Dash, its ok :)
Silly Gandalf, that wasn't the way to deal with fears at all!
Clever tactic, Ghosties...
:(
FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
ARAGORN: PLZ GET OVER URSELVES
I've seen this one seen a bunch of times, that whole part even, but never the rest of this movie.

8and in any case
umad
3Ohai Ghosties
AND IT'S ALL PIPPIN'S FAULT
Now its onto amon hen.
11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The ironic part about the Fellowship mourning the loss of Gandalf was, at that point, none of the cast members had met Ian McKellen, let alone seen him dressed up as the wizard.
;_;
/me giggles at ghosties
lol ghosties
umad Ghosties
7you will be missed...but we got tons of stuff todo
lol that's what featherfall is for.
0The is a name!?
Dat irony
time to put the breaks on this turbo chat
Gandalf should have giggled a the ghosties
They should've flown on the eagles to Mordoor anyways. Finally Gandalf realizes this
inb4 EVERYONE DIES. EVERYONE F***ING DIES.
really, gimli?
Ghosties missed half of the movie.
7the timing is bad...
Gandlaf should have tried giggling at the Balrog. . .
Serious, gimli
what's that? Gandalf evolves into ghosties
get them up
hmmm
that's hilarious!
so when gandalf dies he becoms a ghostie?
GIVE EM A MOMENT FOR PITY'S SAKES
PITY'S SAKE
pity has nothing to do with this
Orps?
SOMEONE WAS SO STUPIDTHAT HE GIGLED AT GANDALF
Aragon serioused the hell up
that's good trivia, haha
0Giggle at the Balrogy
I love LOTR.
0Acquire victory
ya, for fuck's sake. let them mourn.
I hope discord looks like balrog
4Pretty sad moment right here
14Yeah, timing inst best. But...
:c
8i want to hand it over to ghosties, sir sprinkles and sathi, you all are more than capable of effectively running it
4Frodo turning and tears
inb4 frodocry.avi
They shouldve giggled at it, wtf
4:(
:(
epic tear
0Giggling at tbe balrog is an exceptionally bad idea.

The?
0It's all their faults for not giggling
manly tears where shed
o.O
:(
:'(
:(
he lacked the elements of harmony when facing the balrog
Way to get your boots wet
The person named "the" is such a troll
Girly tears were shed
Manly shed was tears
...oh wait

THE TROLL
4Stay for now, will you?

0He lacked the 7th Element - Mithril
Hmmm, that's sad. Anybody got anymore Elvish magic bread?
men don't cry they get even
How long is this again?
Dammit, I feel myself going crosseyed. I may not make it to the end. Please, if I shall fall, take my loot
Hey look! Lothlorien is apparently right over there.

HE SAID TROLOLOLOLO
hi Twi
Someone tell that Welsh Dwarf to STFU

We're down to eight members. Anyone care to map the mane cast to them?
Girl said her favorite thing about Lord of the Rings was Orlando Bloom's hair. I slapped her.
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
Elves are commies
HOW great an evil?

EVIL
Anyone seen Tin Man? Great mini-series.
Frodo is evil, true.
4No, I mean, stay in the chat for now
Y U NO LET US PASS
EEEEEEEVVVVVVIIIIILLLLLLLLL
Evil is always great.

DAMMIT HALDIR

Nobody ever brings mild evil.
7Well, i'm glad your not leaving us permanently!
YES TIN MAN WAS AWESOME
lotsa moonspeak
omg hatless gimli
0I'm sure the elves will appreciate you magically transforming their trees
11he*
Translation:
well, Rarity - Legolas, Applejack - Gimple are pretty much clear
He said something about rarity, just sayin
Or medium evil
*runs around randomly screaming "EEEEVVVVIIIIILLLLL"*
*can we eat them?*
Frodoshy
He's pretty much saying "Look, let us in. We're cool, I swear."
hehehe
Ghosties, translate :P
dramatic part... unsuccessful.
Yeah he does
How can anyone find Elijah Wood evil? Look at those big innocent eyes
FOREEEEEEVER
so spike is frodo?
4Translate?
@apprentice1994 hi Apprentice!
*no, they must be offered to the high priestess*
4Why?
Boromir is a complex character
no gandulshy
gandalf sparkle
4I don't know what they're saying
Elijah wood was a murderer in sin city
and ever
what pony would da dwarf be?
aragorn: twilight or rainbow
all the deleted scenes really help boromir to be a little less 2 dimensional
Applesam
3*Translation* Gimli is such a jackass, am I right?
spike=frodo works
Dash - Aragorn
Dead people whiegh a loy
He looked damn evil then
I just lost the game.
boromir is human
Epic amon hen battle coming up
ahh
Pretty trees
snails and snips are merry and pippin
fuck you x.x
You bring somewhat annoying and not very significan't evel with you. Have a nice stay.
it's twilight's house!!!
James Wood is evil, why wouldn't Elijah Wood be also?
Dash-Aragorn shipping?
ewoks
NOT IN MY F***ING FANDOM
14So pretty
....
IT'S FLUTTERSHY!!!
not sure if lucious malfoy or bad memory
Rarity - Legolas, Applejack - Gimli, Fluttershy - Frodo, Twilight - Aragorn, Rainbow Dash - Sam (just kidding Boromir), Pinkie Pie - Merry/Pippin
Twi=Aragorn would fit better
8i am staying in the chat
UP UP UP THE STAIRSSSSS
1 whoul hour left
oooo
You're Gandalf the Dead, of course you can translate.
Someone needs to ponify Arigorn RIGHT NOW
na, lyra and bon bon = pippin and merry
4And now I'm thirsty
SHIPPING?? IN MY BRONYSTATE???
So much blue
12Boromir is the best character. No deleted scenes are needed to to establish that fact.
FLOOTERSHY
8ive been switching to and from it this whole time
Fluttershy-Frodo
MFW
Best Treehouse ever!
infinity stairs
name change 4 me
4Think I may get some carbonated beverage or something
what is this place filled with so many wonders....
Lol they basically use the same music in the WoW NE starting zone
FLOOTERSHAI
hah
Twilight is totally Gandalf.
good, but the frodo?
gilda needs to be borimir
Dash would be Gimli
gawd... this is... BOOORING
i would like to be a tree
carbonated Leverage?
4And I respectfully disagree. Gandalf is best character
The elves are basically the best ponies.
How does the elf witch perform magic without a horn?
If Fluttershy is Frodo, I guess Rainbow Dash would be Sam? Loyalty and all that
she's an evil enchaaaaantress
Hey, I just remembered, Elijah Wood was in one of the Back to the Future movies.
Dash would be Aragorn.
This music needs more flute.
oooooo...shiny...
3Twi is Gandalf, it is canon
celestia = gandalf
Frodoshy, Twilagorn, Legoty etc
so bright
that tree they're in is fluttershy
SHES AN EVIL ENCHANTRESS SHE DOES EVIL DANCES, AND WHEN YOU LOOK HER IN THE EYE SHE WILL PUT YOU IN TRANCES. AND WHAT WILL SHE DO, SHE'LL COOK UP AN EVIL BREW, AND SHE'LL GOBBLE YOU UP IN A BIG TASTY STU! Soooooooo... WATCH OUT!
Celestia is Gandalf....Twilight is
HEY EVERYONE KANRAS IN THE HOUUUUSE
dunno
o HAI RARITY
dash wouldn't be gimli
but Gandalf died, so Twilight's now Aragorn
您好
luna is sauron
Okay
SHES AN EVIL ENCHANTRESS
lol wut
ITS A TRAP
So shiny
Celestia is Sauron
=_=
3Wait...then does that make Boromir Pinkie?
APPLEBLOOM IS FRODO
Look! It's Luna!
<0>
INSTEAD OF A DARK LORD YOU SHALL HAVE A QUEEN!
12Celestia is Gandalg.
4Alright, good
I can't deal with the level of stupidity here anymore
whoever was looking for a translation here you go http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_elvish.htm

here comes the CMC singing elves
EVIL ENCHANTRESS
EYE!
My soul froze a little
MINDFUCK
Dem eyes.

Frodo is fluttershy
11<0>
Raep faice
GALADRIEL IS EITHER RARITY OR CELESTIA
mindraep time.
Õ_Õ
IMA IN YOUR HEAD
does evil dances
You must diiiie.
*so who here has a cat?*
Legolas is rarity
even the stare... definitely fluttershy
Galadriel is Luna.
8dwarves = earth ponies, elves = pegasus, humans = unicorns
11<=0=>
@_@
me
3Sorry, not enough heart.
me
Fine, galadriel is luna
3Try again later.
hahaha, maintenant je suis français
Sindri: finally an ally!
>allergic to cats
rockets?
Aragorn but elves can perform magic
Then what are hobbits?
7lol RobotPinkie
um... elves are pretty obviously unicorns?
Aragorn: if elves are pegasi then elves are best
why is humans = unicorns?!
Rockets?
just wait until she goes nightmare later.
Gandalf made good shit blow up
wow poetry
i love cats
The foinest rockets ever seen.
gandalf isnt a human
11Dwarves = Diamond Dogs
dat rhyming like a boss
0Rockets... What is this...
11Humans = Earth Ponies
Bad poem for Frodo
J'ai toujours voulu être capable de parler français, et maintenant je peux
poetry fail
Samwise raps better than buster bunny
Sam's poetry. Better than Vogon poetry.
Trixie rockets :P
since when is sam literate
11Unicrons = wizards
rockets = fireworks
Samwise slept through poetry class
14Rockets. How do they work?
He made shit blow up real good
4I agree with Gimli
Place be dreamy
Samwise don't ryhme like Zecora
who would frodo be as a pony?
Elves are clearly Unicorns
Take rest out of petty cash
Humans and dwarfs=Earth Ponies
Samwise's rap career never really took off.
PP
apprentice 1994 Caramel
Hobbits are just fillies
orc=parasprite
Gandalf, other wizards, elves= Unicorns
Which one is pinkie?
I can't figure out how I keep falling behind the stream
:O Celestia is gollum becuz gollum is biggest troll
Dwarfs=Diamond Dog
3Then what are elves?
Ils seront probablement tous mourir
Orcs = Snips & Snails
Boromir's father is awesome.
looking at a lotr book map
Frodo would be a midget Earth Pony
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
so the hobbits = CMCs?
Pinkie ish Frodo, i believe :P
pegasus
3Elves=Pegasi?
Frodo is Applebloom. Samwise is Scootaloo, and dat other one's Sweetie Belle.
Pippin Pie
orcs=parasprites clearly
Yes.
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
someone draw sauron as an alicorn
or maybe unicorns
ninjapwny YES
my head is full of apples
Don't forget Dinky
@<dispatchrabbi> you don't talk about vogon poetey
yep. hobbits = CMC
0Omg
Merry is Sweetie Belle, Pippin is Dinky
booyah
NO
SO WHEN DO DWARVES DIGGY DIGGY HOLE IN THIS MOVIE?!
anyone with a ring of power is a Alicorn... so galadrial is a Alicorn
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
CMC HOBBITS!!!
0I just noticed the g3 MLP advertisement in the chat box..
frodo is dinky
Scootaloo is Sam
0MAKE IT GO AWAY
Hobbits/Mem = earth ponies. Wizards = Unicorns. Elves = Pegasi
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
Applebloom is Frodo
Samwise is Scootaloo just for that last scene, and only that last scene. XD
lol wut?
My chatbox ad is tesco
SOMEONE DRAW THIS FANART
NAOW
n the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie
8<iBrony>: I just noticed the g3 MLP advertisement in the chat box.. <--- wat
3FUCK YEAH PEGASI
chilis
Anyone with rings=Alicorn
Never Odin, Simon was too busy when they filmed this.
I would say Galadrial is powerful enough to be an alicorn
3 /ELVES
if Galadriel = Luna, does that make "YOU SHALL HAVE A QUEEN"!Galadriel = Nightmare Moon?
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
nazgul?
YES
10pegasi > elves
my ad is...meet military singles...wow...
Applebloom being frodo... she should have a ring cutie mark
Oh man.
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness, BRONIFY THEM
Sure, why not?
Celestia's back!
ThunderDash: exactly.
HERE COMES NIGHTMARE MOON
she's and evil enchantress
nazgul = shadowbolts
i got a lotr:online ad
CMC RING BEARERS!
8pegasus ponies are best ponies
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
Is pippin Pinkie or Dinky?
Ooh, pretty elf lady
If hobbits are CMC, then Frodo=Sweetie, Sam=Applebloom, Pippin=Scoots
0What are the chances of that Aragorn?
3GO BACK TO ENGLAND RON_WEASLEY
sauron = trixie
Aragorn: Dash is worst pony
ok wait for it the epic line
the scene that comes now could have been done SOOO much better
nah not evil missunderstood
By the way, I lost the game...
Dr Whooves = Tom Bombadil
11Coming up: The most WTF scene in the entire movie
boromir's dad=prince blueblood?
Not gonna lie, I'd jump her bones
>Galadriel
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
the cmc and twist should be the hobbits
WHORE
lol
ROFL
stupid elf bloom effect
AND RARITY FALLING FROM THE SKY
Nah, Sam is Sweetie Belle
>idsmitethat.jpg

Frikking game-losing

NO U
sam is scootaloo

derpy should be sauron
techdude300: read the books
8<RDash>: Dashie is best pony! <---Yes she is
CAJ, I concur
this scene is so much better in the animated LOTR movie
QUICK EVERYONE BREATHE AND BLINK MANUALLY
Sam is more scooty
rinbow poni is best poni
inb4 elky kicked
La plupart indubitablement
not the bakshi one
Galadriel is Zecora+Fluttershy+Celestia
probably a reflection
Boob
3Dont ya know? I am loyalty.
Aragorn is right
huh, no kick for that
How many things?
4inb4GaladrielYOU'REGOINGTOLOVEME!
It shows boob
LIKE SPRING FLOWERS
HOMOEROTIC TENSION! Wait, this is with a girl. I miss Gandalf and his HOMOEROTIC TENSION!
dat pause
yes
ooooh scary
Ponies are best ponies
hi ninjapwny
Because if sam is sweetie, that forces merry to be scooty, which he isn't
so many wonders
Hi
YES!
11It's a pensive?
UPDATE!
SHE COULD JUST SAY PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE
... the what.
Don't look Frodo!
VERY OLD animated version, yeah
EQUESTRIA DAILY!!!!!!!!!!!
Sam is scoots, clearly
8inb4 crazy lady
If you stare into the abyss.....
brave but not too bright
in the animated movie, you cant really tell that its Saurons eye, but thats what makes it scary
ive seen it, nijapwny
sorry i havent been in the chat
3LOYALTY....FUCK YEAH
8lol silverscreen
Crazy cat lady
The abyss stares into you.
4The abyss stares back at you
What's equestria daily?
ninjapwny*
confound these ponies they cause me to look into the future
She stole that from dumbledore!!!
its just like an eye like shape
0Aragorn, why haven't people changed their nickname to one of the mane 6?
Scootaloo is definitely Pippin
frodo should be applebloom
the EqD chat, that is
did i miss the part with YOU SHALL NOT PASS
>The Abyss
4Or, yeah, something to that effect.
Scoots = best CMC, Samwise = best LotR character.
Pippin is snails...
so many emo
WTF? Worst mirror ever!
Yes
what has been seen....
then who is dinky?
ah
Look! It's the part of the books they forgot to film!
Dat Scouring of the Shire
8iBrony, what do you mean?
"This mirror sucks ass, I can't see myself at all"
I'd call Pippin Sweetie Bell
Mirror = fail
CUPCAKES FACE
dinky is frodo
wow who knew thats what frodo looks like?
0Frodo is Frodo
It's a cat on fire.
TRIVIA: This scenario actually happened in the book, where Saruman took over the Shire
This movie needs more Prince Imrahil
<0>
its too overblown
look, it's industry!
I SEE POO!!!
Sam is definitely Scoot
I like how this is the only reference to the scourging of the shire...
Reflection Fail
Pippin is too wild to be sweetie
Yeah
0Why hasnt someone changed their name to something like Fluttershy, or Rainbow Dash
Ouch
Silly stupid Eldar
0Are they to scared to?
weird
Stop hitting yourself
wtf mirror
Sauron put a trojan in the mirror
Sam is scoot
If it's a meme, we've already passed it
scootaloo is pippin
You said?
so hot the water is steaming
This upcoming scene=zillion times better than the animated version.
Cant have spaces in the name
It reminds me how much content they skipped in harry potter 5
As if PP fell like she did in ep 1
btw
How do you change nicks, is it /nick?
Frodo is applebloom becuse they're mane characters
<0>

nightmare moon X discord
PsychoElf*
KILL THAT BITCH
the test
You wouldn't say either fluttershy or Rarity if you read Its a dangerous business going out your door
Can somebody explain this
In the animated movie she literally walks around giggling then says "I passed the test"
The TREE is fluttershy
well... that scene makes it worth arriving 2 and a half hours late for this stream
Oh hai elven ring of power
who the fuck wrote that rule
All shall love me and despair... if you don't mind.
11She's another ring bearer.
WUT?
Yeah, Galadriel can't be Fluttershy; Treebeard is Fluttershy.
Aragorn: no but in all honesty, Dash is like my second or third favorite.
haha, cirek
a ring bearer? ooooo, is there going to be a wedding?
Jeez I really had to hit the books lately.

Boromir is a fighter. He's got a great fort save, but shitty will

3MY PERCEPTION IS OFF THE CHARTS
8Boromir must be Faramir tomorrow
viking burial!
His dad is insane
Except Wrek, Ghosties, and dari.
I like how there's still lots of Uruk Hai looking for Frodo, but the party just pauses 'Eh, let him deal with them... no need to follow them.'
Press A to search body. You found: Horn of Gondor
14That would be insane.
It's nogay if they're dead. It's necrophilia.
