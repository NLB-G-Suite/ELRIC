Wow
Wut
8,1pony_7129: absolutely nothing.
I like how this movie boils down to pure theft of good material from good movies, slapped together with duc tape and paste, and its only original jokes are jokes intended for a very immature audience. >_>
Ty Epicpion3 xD
umm lol
its an evactuation
wait... were we arguing over something?
GET-CRUNKY!
8,1i'm serious

>implying this movie deserves any sort of respect at all
While I'm laughing at everypony's response, clearly, some folks haven't seen "Who's line is it anyway?"
Apparently we're being too plaintive.
lets all get krunk
I think Dermathil just likes arguing against the popular opinion for the sake of arguing.
there are good B movies
yes
Just like Calculus. Impossible to discover without guessing.
"taught me how do decipher these"
Sorry, but atrocity is atrocity, like it or not.
obvious trll is obvious

far too good for this
no, If I wans to explain why it's shit, I'd point to the fact that every joke made in this is a joke that was made for YEARS before this movie came out, and is delivered with all the comedic timing of the Holocaust.
Ok, im done with this....

Ron has a pedo stache

we NEED some pony after that
time for some family appreciation
Dont get mad
04WHOA
Actually the G1 movie can be pretty funny if you feel like mocky the hell out of it.
Dari: I would rather die a meaningless death than grant that PoS movie any credit. >_>
where's the stream?
i wanted to say something about that
really?
I'm gonna go lay a beating on my dad
04HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE
3dari know nothing of what he says
i think i saw that when it came out but it was less ... agonising
eeyup
err no
Blazing Saddles is a classic
Amen
Ponies will fix an hour of torture!
blazing saddles is amazing
What does wMC mean
04YOU'RE DISSING MEL BROOKS
ponie yesh
Discord wants us to be mad
MrDrProfIshBestPony: true, but not during BMN please, it'a a rule is all
The best thing for FimFictino to do is restore it, and possible press criminal charges against whoever did it
Eh
dang got disconnected
04NIGGA PLEASE
i did just wondering what they fucked up
Dont get mad
Blazing Saddles is funny at the end
blazing saddles is awesome
Spike for best pony
I got my shit ready
well after that I guess it's time to call it a night, after all I do need to be up in about 8 hours to go airsofting. See y'all ponies later.

"Some guy tried hacking fimfiction. The site is down while we figure out if anything bad happened. (The redirection to 0au.de was because that's the default site for this server; sorry about that."
Lets just burn down discords house
Blazing Saddles is shit too
leave the chat and come back under the same username
Blazing Saddles will still be a classic when this movie is forgotten
ya
Dat black screen!
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
it felt like 10
good night!
Mel Brooks is a boss!
WMC my ass. You want a WMC worty movie? I will start voting for it from now untill it wins and you will regret it
The only thing that makes Plan 9 a technically worse movie was that the writer-director-producer was sincerely trying to make a "Proper" film.
Goodnight my fan!
:o
hey if anyone has direct tv i know you can watch mlp fim on the hub 294 so show your support ffor the show
Ponies, for the love of Celestia, give us ponies.
Im a pony addict
Whats on next?
Yay! Luna is speaking 1337 again!
next week play street fighter the movie
is stream dead?
The more everybody argues the more the streamer is distracted and the longer itll take for episode.
Water Babes
This movie....
I get 404 error XD
So it will be coming back up eventually
Congratulations to all those who survived that shit storm of a movie :) You rock. Woohoo
i can haz ponies now?
aw hell naw, you're not bashing mel brooks after watching a Friedburg and Seltzer movie
so now what?
never again
im sure this movie made us all get therapies :)
Black Screen > Blue Sceen
Blazing Saddles was boring and lacked in ANY kind of humour.
that's what the fimfiction site says
worst movie ever
I'm ambivalent. I can see why this movie would be "geniusly bad" or "plain horrid."
good night everypony
you will all learn what real rage is
Idiotic or intelligent
absolutely
MORE MOVIES
So who wants to watch it again?
gnight luna_fan!

blazing saddles was THE shit, it wasnt shit. it was my favorite film on this stream since i started watching, neext to hot fuzz
..... blazing saddles is a work of comedic satire genuis

Nobody's arguing. We ALL thought it was shit.
Well, just have to be patient for my pony i guess :V
*genious

Everyone else just gives ratings as usual.

Fastforward
Mel Brooks

Tabitha is best voice actor ever (post Rarity if you agree)
That's a reason?
frens
i argee rainbow is best
Fuck that.
FRRRIIEND
I love that title song. :3
15 tabs? A bit obsessive.
Peace has been restored to the lands of Bronystate
;)
I want more pinkie pie!

Watch for Twilight's troll-face in the opening credits... my friends didn't notice it until I pointed it out to them

It's funny. Very funny

At last.
Rainbow Dash is Best Pony

seltzerberg didn't make it
eeyup
^
Rarity!
BronyTJ: Best reason

Pretty well thanks
Dari hates everything. it's just that some things he hates slightly less than others.
Black protagonist
>_<
^
the italian verision is awsopme
A thousand times ^
what the world needs now, is friendship
also more puddinghead
I rarely stay for the poni, but that movie was just so bad and this is my favorite episode
she messed up derpy
04So much -b
too much Rainbow in this season, I mean she's not a bad character, but we need more PIE
Gene Wilder
bigmac is best goos
Maybe, and yes RAinbow Dash is best pnoy :D
What does WMC mean?
Who does dashie?
did Granny just say "move your ass" to Mac?
????
thought she was a boy
great lession
Watch mlp
thats not how u spell pinkie pie\
Lol InglouriousPony89
fluttershy is best pony (say i if you agree)
Pretty much same here StinkomanFan. :P
/me snuggles everypony
Watch for the signs of the applepocalypse!
Worst movie clause.
yeah
ya
04WMC means Worst Movie Clause
d'awww
More fluttershy
dat blank flank!
This movie was just so bad this this is now my favorite episode.
Say EEYUP for the next three days
<3
fluttershy/rainbowdash cutie mark painting is bes pony
and Gene Wilder
I need to wipe that away
Say
So we never have to endure it again.
watch mlpfim= cured.
dern alzheimers
if
Ashleigh something does Dashie and Applejack
Plus, I was planning on reading the latest update to Eternal, but it's only on Fimfiction :(
Too late for you guys StinkomanFan and Lasharus?
:D <3 :o
Ponies, finally!
You can't ignore Gene Wilder
and the Cake twins' episode counted for nothing?
Fluttershy is The BEST
:D
Even though I normally don't like it much
eeyup
epic movie should be WMC'D
Ashleigh Ball
NOT!
04It was created during the showing of Babes In Toyland, the original winner of that prize
It's more that the character development for Rainbow Dash in this season basically portrays her as a jerk
I say EEYUP all day, erry day.
I want more scoots, actually
Ash is best
It's only 4:45 AM Everlasting_Joy. :p
most usless broom ever
That's it
lol
brooooom'd
Lasharus: Same here
the zap applepocalypse
You have a weird way of spelling "Rainbowdash" SilentOpsPictures
that was only 1 episode
Epic Movie is epic.
:(
that movie was worse than everything it parodied put together
post
can we watch friendship is witchcraft after?
herbal ingredient
Same
Only applied to two films past.
we need more twilight too
Hehehe.
She has her own band
yes!! :)
dashy
two eps
It's only 9:45
both are amazing ponys
including Cribs and Punk'd
Can we ad all the movies made by those guys to WMC?
back to back
there was a sweetie ep, an apple bloom ep
yes!
Fluttershy is second best pony
is broom...
brain bleach
Even for the same fanfic TheGreatAndPowerfulT? :P
:D
AUGH! I refresh the page and NOW its lagging? DAMMIT!!
Rightly so I might add ¬_¬
butters?
And RD is 20% cooler
Lol
where's the scoots ep?
babes in toyland.. *shivers*
All Seltzer and Friedburg films should be WMC
The comedy actually flowed naturally in Blazing Saddles and never missed a beat, The jokes were NEVER explained, unlike Epic Movie.
I say Eeyup wheneever I can! But nopony understands where its from :(
alzheimers is best pony
Interlude :U
only 1 of pinkie is what i meant
Midnight_Fire: eenope.
what films are WMC'D so far?
Goddam it big mac, Your awesome!
If this is WMC'ed, Blazing Saddles definitely should be.
Right here
storm
ooh friendship is witchcraft
that there's a broom lol!
Winter is comming
i will never forgive tabitha for ruining derpy
oh
hi
:D:D:D

yeah witchraft niegh soul sister
soon, young one, soon
i havent seen her have her own episode beside lesson zero
:D

brace urselves
There wasn't a single funny scene in it.
Something wicked this way comes....
"It smells like lightning"
:D
:D
04But people liked WMC
The bronies and I will always pop MLP jokes in class
Never again may we watch that movie.
And it was meant to be funny.
she didn't ruin her
04Er
when big mac cries I cry :U
INFAMOUS
Mignight_Fire, oh come on Superhero Movie was pretty funny, and so were the two first Scary movies!
11,01We retroactively-added Spider Web to WMC as well.
04Liked Blazing Saddles
Witchcraft is best abridged serie
dat music
:|
epic apples are epic
3No Blazing Saddles was funny and great
05blazing got out due to the credits
I like Blazing Sadddles
storms a brewen
then the 4-channers will scream cancer
Big Mac needs his own episode
Jesus what is in these trousers.
I will work on my fanfiction once more after this
what is friendship is witchcraft?
When is the new episode coiming out?
1,3not her fault if she was never told the character background
It's always fun
