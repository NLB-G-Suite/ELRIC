You know what? I don't know ANYTHING about age, I mean to me JFK looked like he was in his early 3o's

DrGNs: Works wonders, they get bored and fuck off by themselves most times. =)

DO YOU HAVE AN IPV6 AND SSL CONNECTION I CAN GET ON?
Did you hear about the pony disaneterexia, it's a disease that slowly deteriorates the ponies heart
Because its a private school and we are all dim
fangs
freefall29: I like this plan
07that are like 3 feet long
03yeah I remember seeing W/F for zoom going "wtf?"
02cost like $5000
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/172108 Same voice actors
Trixie well...that's...not...good
03makes more sense to just call it zoom in/out
03IMO
03which is what everything now does xD
jks becaus they want the best results out of us
Sherlock.. Holmes?
Oh lol, did one of the 12 year old regulars get banned?
sherlock holmes
05yeah its sherlock
I can't help but find that at least a bit amusing
sheerlock holmes
xD Catchy
long load
Sherlock Holmes is an awesome move
:P
*movie
AirPuff is best pony
whyd they get banned?
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/172108 Same voice actors
Kicks and bans all over the place. Nice to see regular cleanups.

they gotta do a monty python sketch in season 3.
Spike is best pony.
03he got it when I was born
xD
airpuff, I second that
05welcome to bronystate xles. where the mods care about a clean envirioment.
Wonder who he was trolling as
hes usually cow334
Screw it, I got better things to think about then how old all the ponies are
03so he could be one of those obnoxious fathers and videotape my entire childhood
/me hides
Wrek|Observing: =D
LOL
my father nearly did
lol
The world is crawling with trolls and attackers, we can try to fix up all hate on Earth, OR move to the moon and colonize it creating the new world of ponies, as ridiculous as it may seem
freefall29: I sooo hope they do a black knight in everfree forest.
spike is a pretty underrated guy to be honest
And that is why we all Wub you
but he sadly never used it really :<
SuperBrony64: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-899
it broke in 2007ish
02http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Camera-18-55mm-3-5-5-6/dp/B0012YA85A <-- that's the camera I have now
a decade old I think
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/172108 Same voice actors
I love Spike, he funny.
StinkomanFan: no you dont, now get back to pony speculation
DrGNs: TO THE MOON! :)
xles http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix7vrluEm4E ;)
DrGNs, moving to the moon would be way easier, though
Back! For long time i hope
So.... where'd Peewee go?
Wb KaitoThePony
hi KaitoThePony
Sooooo much stupid in mane chat.
02I didn't get the lens kit
I mean Spike seemed to like him
Krakass: This is why I hang here.
How long is the movie anyway?
03yeah, my dad has a very similar one
To be honest, all ponies are the best ponies, how can I pick one?
03his is Nikon
Sup my fello bronies
Then it's settled, To the moon is the bronies next target
in pet hammerspace just like winona
03but just as obnoxiously big :P
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
the sky
i lovethis part
freefall29: SB is best pony
It wasn't that bad when I first started. And that was only January.
11,02FlareChaser: You're linking me to it again?
http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/172108 Same voice actors
those cameras are uglybig too
eeyip
:P
02I like how big they are though :'D
freefall29: you cannot x)
hi everypony :) wrek is streming?
SuperBrony64: No, its a happy one.
That_Irish_Guy: I don't quite see the point, but it's all good.
03I like being able to transport them in a discreet fashion
So pets just vanish in and out of existance?
cachi01: yeps
cachi01, he sure is
sb?
cachi01: hi and yes he is
05the maid in black lagoon
02;3
...
05such a badass
XD
That is a lie
Krakass: I know right? It's just gotten a lot more 12 year old filled lately.
Guess what I found out guys!!!!! YOULL BE EXCITED!!!!!!
...Pinkie Pie must have something to do with this
Haha
awesome
I suggested to Phase4 to implement a spellcheck kick. 10 errors in 60 seconds or something.
Not what Wrek said
seems like it
Trixie what?
that link
rarity x spike
Trixie: is it me?
still laggy
Not the link being shown
Trixie: fire away?
Trixie, can you vanquish an ursa mayor now?
ScootaChicken, it's not even the age, as you prove. It's the maturity.
can i see that whole pic?
6oh right i need to get a second youtube account
00,10like the style of that Rarity
Rarity you tease.....
RARITY IS THE MAID OF BLACKLAGGON
ô.o
??
As I've said a couple times before, I liked it when I could log into mane chat and know pretty much everyone in the chat.
11,02FlareChaser: It wasn't, stop linking me to them and linking them in chat please.
03Roara|Animating is that address in the PayPal email your current one?
Is having anal sex with ponies legal in the us?
Trixie: O.O
SuperBrony64: Fine.
no
I'm sixteen and I sometimes act like the most sophisticated person here
.....
thats bestiality
05i wish i could draw metal and stone like that :0
02But ew the lens that camera comes with. Used a different lens right after buying it
Take that as you will
/me zips his mouth.
voices fluttershy and pinkie
still bucking laggy
Oh...my
00,10......uhhhhhh how did my 6 in 10 trigger when wreks 5 in 10 did not?
now if you use science to switch minds with a horse.... yeah.
SuperBrony64: sorry :(
03my dad has two lenses, I think, a near and far one
Wrek|Observing: u so pro anyway
03or something
02ah
03I honestly don't see what the big deal is
6my current one yes
03that camera only does 6 megapixel
But beastality is fun
freefall29, last thing I heard bestiality was legal in some states, though
03my mom's Sony does like 12
Trixie: mey I dance on your head?
03and has better looking pictures
03despite being a point and shoot
Trixie....you mean to tell me that your Aunt is the voice actor for Sweetie Belle???
6the one used for everything not school related
03so :P
What StinkomanFan said, although that's not particuarly hard given BronyState's population makeup these days.
i gotta poo be right back
PINKIE! FIRE ZE SPARKLE! http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/172107
05Sumica: my account was busy handling a ban request to cahnserv

03OK

....
Dude
So fucking my dog is illegal?
05KaitoThePony: actually its on a coutnry to country basis
Trixie ripped my arms off and stood on my stomach.
^ from manechat
why... would....
07especially if he just uses it on auto mode
03Kyu, my dad just rapidfires everything
03though he does manually focus
03still, the resolution sucks :P
02Megapixels have nothing to do with image quality. Just size
....that reminds me
Thats some of the beter posts from main atm
yeah. lets talk about ponies
07then he's doing it backwards lol
ITS NOT LEGAL ANYWHERE
03yeah, let's not get back into this
PONIES
hshahahahaha
That_Irish_Guy no she voices Pinkie and fluttershy and she is my friends aunt
it's just fun to have sexual relations with horses.
:|
wha?
Screw Loose, what is her story?
so adorkable http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/174764
03no I mean, he'll focus it then just hold down the shutter button
..............
05cachi01: wrong.
03which rapidfires
... and thats how equestia was made!
03it's obnoxious XD
How'd she end up in an asylum?
lol
05but its still frowned upon
totally
Wrek|Observing: mother of god....
02he's doing it wrong
I mean, besides acting like a dog
Trixie....you...are...one...lucky...son...of...a....@$$&%!^!%@!
07the size of the sensor matters much more than megapixels
Somebody attacked her with a screwdriver :-(
HEY DAT SHERLOCK HOLMES MUSIC :D
02^
:)
i love iiiiiiiiiiiiit
Trixie: you must find a way of convinceing her to come on here
It's not that gross.

UnFoundBug, you're right, I'd have to kick myself for mispelling stupidity.
He is a vocaloid pony
05how was the meme now?
02And if you’re not precise enough, manual focus will do more harm than good
Does anyone else wonder what the future fate will be for Rarity and Spike, It seems confusing at the start point that they have a younger dragon interested with a grown mare?
05g5 was it?
So apparently, there's a Soarin' x Pie fic.
yes Wrek
00,10we have a g5 meme?
And it's rated M.
G5
Hello
PEDO

DAAAAAAAAAAAAAM

unless being the holders for the elements of harmony grants enternal life... remember, celestia is over 2,000 years old
00,10i like wreks g5 cause yeah
02you can if you have a lot of time to focus or if it's dark

/me bohoof anybody? /)
cachi01, because vendors wanted it pink.

pyrocatboy that ruins rarity
im going to kill some vendors...
A homerun is fine but you don't want to be the first to "cross the plate"
EpicPwnTime: I bet you don't know the rest of the words
That's just ungentlemanly
g4.0.1

I don't know enough about baseball to contribute.
EpicPwnTime: well it starts off with I am he as you are he as you are me as we are all togther
/me releses cornholio into chat
...is that why my date left after I brought a bat to bed?
...But what's a foul ball with a woman?
Who is best pony?
g4.5 should be about the CMC
freefall29, no problem at all, I was just wondering if I missed anything ^^

anyone excited for movie night?
there is no best pony
and..
Hollywood people have to become bronies!
02like, I always use manual focus for flowers and such XD

Shes.... over Nine THOUSAAAAAAAND!
hollywood would ruin it
wut movie IS IT today????
KaitoThePony, so your special talent is... eating icecream?
05g4.5 is the spinoff where the CMC are teenagers

DrGNs would'nt he be the same
Sorry, it's just PE
?
02sure they are :D
explosions everywhere
DrGNs: done he's not that different
Wrek: As long as they kept the world intact with all the fantasy elements, I'd be ok with that.
If Einstein were a brony he would research a portal to Equestria
please no freefall he is not allowed
i can't
Wrek|Observing: Well, if they have their damn Cutie Marks, guess I'm down.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation
If only.
space alien ponies plus a dragon finding the elements of harmony from the anti-ponies, live action. mindless explosions. an atomic rainbomb destroys the city
ohlawd
I ate so much ice cream that i ate a magic one and became a magical singer
sings hey jude
E=Friendship'n'Magic
OmegaMetroidBrony, after that whole manhatten project desaster he wouldn't tell anyone about it, though
02But most photographers avoid them, because LOL too many flower photos out there
indeed
lol
Speaking of Derpy.... http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/116342?search=Black_Lagoon
Alright, how about we discuss the most amazing story ever written by mankind?
nice dring :)
The Ugly Barnacle
Then the knowledge would die with him :(
07-l
6uh
cliche ending
StinkomanFan, it doesn't sound like you've changed topics at all.
And be passed on
Wrek|Observing: i mean a series whole based on their adventures
E= FM^2 x the power of combining H of M6
/me dances on everyones dead but not wrek because wrek dose not like that sort of thing
we can rebulid him OmegaMetroidBrony
Krakass, THE UGLY BARNACLE IS A METAPHOR
02what do you mean?
Gigity
how about the adventures of daring doo
Dat movie reference
everyone's dead? oh no!!
its interesting how spike is just an assistant to twilight yet gets as much screen time as the mane 6 do
RainbowAsh:I ate so much ice cream that i ate a magic one and became a magical singer
6so much wrong with that statement
Wrek|Observing: Gladiator :3333
head*
Throws a bagel at alexxm
pyrocatboy: Tabitha st. Germaine is awesome!
02Publishers tell me this all the time
why statrexix90
6lol /you/
02:p
KaitoThePony, oh ok, I didn't know magical ice cream could do that.
Your welcome.
6what is you're doing exactly
07of course, there's a difference between cameras as an art medium, and for use as memories =P
magical ice cream? where can you buy that?
The ugly barnacle is that one chick who's really ugly, but good in bed
/me eats the bagel
6*is it
07imo, using them to keep memories is silly
So a butterface
derpy appears 2 seconds on screen and still has morefans than applejack
also, the best way to kill a magical beast is to throw your slippers at it
02I take photos for Getty
6ok well for starters
Poor AJ
I like both cachi01 :)
RainbowAsh: or it was not magical and the the frostbite just froze my throat and made me sing good
wrek why u awesome artist
6"most photographers avoid them" is a stereotype for one thing
02so never ever try to tell me about photos LOL
/me dances
03<Kyu> imo, using them to keep memories is silly <- why?
03how else do you keep memories? :P
cachi01 Big Machintosh says about 3 words at the most and has more fans than apple jack
00,03I'll be back later!
Yes, and everyone "dying" is... well.... yeah
03other than videos, I suppose XD
07by remembering them |D
05guess the movie:
am i a bad person if i made my 9 year old cousin watch SHED.MOV with me?
seeya scoots
03lame
05based of the music alone
yes
6while I admit you may be in the photography field and not me, I do know my fair share of photographers
03"So I was at this really cool place, want proof? Oh wait, it's in my head, sorry"
CCCP: yes
Big Mac
6and I know ultimatums
CCCP You are good then
Atleast, that's one interpretation
Yay Finally done editing my twilight sparkle wallpaper! =D
lol
its shed.mov we are talking about.
CCCP: nope having fun is not bad
CCCP why did you show your cousin that?
13I keep my memories in the form of objects that have sentimental value |D
wait 9 year old?
maybe
lol
6for successful business, photographers will look for more original, relatable photo ropics
6topics
02Roara, I never said they don't take photos of flowers
03you know what's fun? Stock photos.
/me hides
i am going with avater
6no you didn't, you said "most avoid because too many"
CCCP, how did he take it?
Dken2021: well i din't actually mean to she only saw the part where Flutter shy cut RD in half
9 year old is a good age to BECOME A MAN
did your cousin like it?
07well, back when people didn't have digital cameras it made more sense
6I'm just saying what's wrong with that statement lol
REQUIEM FOR A DREAM
Nah my sister saw shed movie and laughed
My cousin is a girl
03what made more sense
6if you talking business, then fine
your giving him a bad image of my little pony. he is gonna have nightmares about fluttershy with a chainsaw now
Wait, is regulars room a secret channel?
I gathered all my pals up before and stayed up at 3 watching ponies
07since people mostly took photos for important stuff
WOMAN
03well
CCCP, ok, how did she take it?
Can your cousin take a joke CCCP? XD
I think so
Yes
PONIES
It's not showing up on the big ponychat channel list
oh, its a girl?
Dken2021: and i didn'y mean to have her see it
03I agree that people take pictures of too many things, like their duckfaces on Facebook :P
ok. your giving her a bad image
03but if I go on vacation
Yep ScootaChicken
That explains so much.
02I was talking business
03of course I'm going to take pictures
Hi bronystate
She laughed
hi FillyFlam
6>specifics next time
ãllo FillyFlam
whne is she done?
And it also makes me quite happy.
hi FillyFlam
hey FillyFlam:
Dat FliiyFlam
what music is this
CCCP: then thats good
02I know :p
Its so calming?!
requim for a dream
i did not force her to though
But it's not super secret because it still shows up on a whois
07nowadays millions of dorks take pictures of dumb poses with a dumb phone camera every time they go to a bar to get drunk and act dumb
13I find it funny when I see tourists take photos of random things
*Dat FillyFlam
13like a tree
CCCP oh, well as long as she wasn't scared by it
07so there's that.
07|D
fillyflam hi
03which means if I ever get to meet you guys in California, you're required to take a picture with me
/me hides

HERRO MY PPL!!!!!

1 hour 31 min.
07[14:12:02] <@Kyu> the size of the sensor matters much more than megapixels
Hiya Jaketehsnake
Great, I'll have to buy more inventory space on TF2 soon.
03phone cameras are almost always horrible
07and we're back to that
07|D
hey jaketehsnake hows your day been

07a phone camera that's only 3 megapixels will generally take better pictures
lali-ho kingqball
saw it when it came out my first 3 hr movie
02megapixels are size, size of the sensor is where it's at
StinkomanFan: Was that the episode where Kenny dies?
All the hats
StinkomanFan: Holy caucasian males, man.
TITANIC ON 3D = WORST IDE
Titanic two? Ugh no. zjust No

who's broadcasting on stream ?
ponies make everything better
ScootaChicken: he aint even dead aymore

No matter how you feel about Russel Crowe, Gladiator was an awesome movie.
eh little bit
Why did I get no lag whatsoever during that last song, but major lag now? I's not fair
BRONIES! tonight we dine in HAY!!!
Actually, I should probably not refer to them as 12 year olds, seeing as that's a bit ageist.
03Samurott, your point? Liking them is an opinion too
/me runs
02the only things they make that I don't like are their Nanos and iPads
yes it was krakess
anybrony else possesed by two other spirits
Much better than Russel Crowe: Fighting Around the World
yesh
TheRainbowDash: he was refrencing gladiator
or Hell whatever floats your boat
no more inspired DeathStar do u wanna go on? *evil smile*
I can't say anything about Apple now because either someone will completely obsess about it or hate it

freefall29 chrono trigger?
cachi01: dunno why i couldn't understand u typing mistakes no seriously i really didn't get a single word of da scootaloo sentence..
03people who need more than 32GB?
Nope, you have a scroll bar
2I don't think I would ever use my phone as an MP3 player at all
Pretty darn accurate actually
lol
so that explains the fight between Assassins and Templars....Assassins are broines and Templars are the Haters :O dear Celestia its all SO CLEAR TO ME! lol
chrono trigger and ff7 were both made by square soft
Dat Eye.

*Eats Rainbow Dash*
freefall29 I know

kinda funny at first i thought she was possesed by NMM before the Changeling Queen revealed herself hehe
i kind of hope the season three premeire isnt another eic two-parter, if they happen too often they will lose their mystique

Luna : Did i miss anything? . Celestia:... NOPE
JanisJopleyBird, I think one or two per season is ok. I would prefere a three parter, though
*moar shivers*
It's part of her plan to feed off love and become powerful once more. Careful guys.
little kids:oh no! chrysalis is gonna marry shing armor! bronies:LITTLE MERMAID!
The thing is she is E.V.I.L! Discord just wanted to mess around
Cadenza implies Cadence to me
Chrysalis, yeah that's it. :P
So.
this is perfect
All the villains need to come back in season 3.....
that emotion :)
brilliant
QUESTION: Woudl this song be as good without the animation to back it up?
CreativePonyName why?
The finale could have easily been a feature-length movie.
I actually like evil cadance's voice better than good cadance
