Trixie ripped my arms off and stood on my stomach.
^ from manechat
why... would....
07especially if he just uses it on auto mode
03though he does manually focus
03still, the resolution sucks :P
02Megapixels have nothing to do with image quality. Just size
....that reminds me
Thats some of the beter posts from main atm
yeah. lets talk about ponies
07then he's doing it backwards lol
ITS NOT LEGAL ANYWHERE
03yeah, let's not get back into this
PONIES
hshahahahaha
it's just fun to have sexual relations with horses.
wha?
03no I mean, he'll focus it then just hold down the shutter button
..............
05cachi01: wrong.
03which rapidfires
... and thats how equestia was made!
03it's obnoxious XD
lol
05but its still frowned upon

02he's doing it wrong
Trixie....you...are...one...lucky...son...of...a....@$$&%!^!%@!
07the size of the sensor matters much more than megapixels
Somebody attacked her with a screwdriver :-(

07-l
6uh
And be passed on
02what do you mean?
Gigity
Dat movie reference
6so much wrong with that statement
head*
02Publishers tell me this all the time
6lol /you/
02:p
6what is you're doing exactly
magical ice cream? where can you buy that?
/me eats the bagel
6*is it
07imo, using them to keep memories is silly
derpy appears 2 seconds on screen and still has morefans than applejack
02I take photos for Getty
6ok well for starters
6"most photographers avoid them" is a stereotype for one thing
02so never ever try to tell me about photos LOL
/me dances
03<Kyu> imo, using them to keep memories is silly <- why?
03how else do you keep memories? :P
00,03I'll be back later!
Yes, and everyone "dying" is... well.... yeah
03other than videos, I suppose XD
07by remembering them |D
05guess the movie:
am i a bad person if i made my 9 year old cousin watch SHED.MOV with me?
03lame
05based of the music alone
yes
6while I admit you may be in the photography field and not me, I do know my fair share of photographers
03"So I was at this really cool place, want proof? Oh wait, it's in my head, sorry"
6and I know ultimatums
Atleast, that's one interpretation
lol
its shed.mov we are talking about.
13I keep my memories in the form of objects that have sentimental value |D
wait 9 year old?
maybe
lol
6topics
02Roara, I never said they don't take photos of flowers
03you know what's fun? Stock photos.
/me hides
i am going with avater
6no you didn't, you said "most avoid because too many"
9 year old is a good age to BECOME A MAN
6I'm just saying what's wrong with that statement lol
Nah my sister saw shed movie and laughed
My cousin is a girl
03what made more sense
6if you talking business, then fine
I gathered all my pals up before and stayed up at 3 watching ponies
WOMAN
03well
Yes
PONIES
oh, its a girl?
03but if I go on vacation
02I was talking business
03of course I'm going to take pictures
She laughed
6>specifics next time
whne is she done?
Dat FliiyFlam
02I know :p
requim for a dream
i did not force her to though
07nowadays millions of dorks take pictures of dumb poses with a dumb phone camera every time they go to a bar to get drunk and act dumb
07so there's that.
07|D
/me hides
No it doesnt
not anymore
My brother has ponyfobia
Oh.
maybe we're underestimating little girls now
its now under +s
i felt bad afterwards though
i made all my friends watch cupcakesHD LOL
Maybe it does if you're already in the room?
Which actually makes it secrey
03I'm talking about actually taking pictures when you're away from home
05did anyone make a guess yet?
6I like photos for memories, but not excessivelt
6y
07which is why I hate point and shoot and phone cameras with a passion lol
6I like documentation
Try exiting and whoIsing me, you wont find it
03I just take pictures of whatever I think is cool or unique
6probably why I'm half-historian for my club
/me runs
05I'll say which movie at the end of it
