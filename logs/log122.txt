lolol, I'll take that as a compliment, Neponig :P
Lawl, I wish I did Luna. XD
Pokemon Emerald - when you fight champion - god that theme was awesome
uggg music is like candy, you need to take the RAPPER off of it first
The Saturos battle music is better boss music
I feel like jumping through a window.
bufurd actually there's tons of good Rap out there.
oh cool.
RAWRity: Lulz
i'm okay with this music.
4But it's the leaked version
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc&feature=feedu
Awesome video game music? I can do that.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZrQialji38
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbXVNKtmWnc.jpg for epic boss music
no, there is tons of good POETRY RAWRity, music does not include rap
@Sol Meh, I just like that background music for some reason XD
4So you have to go into the .jar files to work it
Yes, you can, Thunder_Dash.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM8muC_uWUk
bufurd, then let me rephrase, there's tons of good hip-hop out there,
Anyways, anypony know what song this is?
Also the Jenova boss theme from FF7 is absolutely amazing.
Why thank you :P
if im going to dance, ill dance to techno thank you RAWRity
Thank you Sol
Best final boss music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvY-BCvfR2U
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVA2z_zbWwA
bufurd that's fine, but to throw off an entire genre of music is pretty narrow minded.
what's this PMV?
found an actual good thread on /b/

>good
Transexuals: Men in disguise. XD

bufurd so they may not be able to sing, that doesn't mean they scan't make good music. It's like saying "metal vocalists who growl can't sing, so their music doesn't count"

this video, it is awesome
except music is an incredibly broad medium, bufurd, and just because a person is rapping doesn't meen they aren't part of music. Does that mean spoken word isn't music?
PISSED BLOOD
This video.
xD
i think Cage is mad
Damn, Nick kisses his mom with that mouth
Does he have Tourettes?
Nicholas has just been Caged! *punched*
This video is the quintessential brony state movie.

PUNCH
>inb4 punch
thats exactly what im saying RAWRity, if you speak it, its not a song i think the same thing for oldies rock songs when they just speak a bunch of crap
saw it coming
KICK
Bear punch is best punch.
inb4 the next inb4
damn. i must leave the awesome :c
Falcon Punch, hes doing it wrong
BITCHES
Punching movement is best movement
lol bearpunch
inb4 bees
…why is he so crazy?
NOT THE BEES
bufurd so...the only thing important song is the vocals? no mention of the intruments? the beat? the tune?
NO NOT THE BEES!!!!
OH GOD THE BEEDS
NOT THE BEES!
NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEES
NOT THE BEESE
Why does he open his mouth with a cage of bees on his head T_T
How do you post those "0008" squares?
Oh Nicholas Cage, your so craaazy!
Nick Cage, never change
Nick cage does good rage acting.
well that was weird...

inb4 cupcakes
*gulp*
Cupcakes, the trailer?
Yup
FUCK CUPCAKES
Dash and fluttershy's excuses ftw.
:(
Jesus fuck, Bronies need to STOP REFERENCING CUPCAKES
Oh dear, look at the time >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER >MURDER
it's OLD
and it's STUPID and OUT OF CHARACTER
lol @ all people who have been scarred by cupcakes
if this was an real movie, i would see it
I'm not scarred, I just hate it because everypony thinks it's fucking canon
flutteryay that's kind of what Fanfic is mostly about.
Flutteryay: actually, Pinkie is incredibly IN CHARACTER in that fic, except of course for the killing part
I would watch it
11> Wes Craven
fluttershining!
:o
11> Stephen Spielburg
Higu Pinkie, no thanks
Now Pinkie scares me
if we are going to talk about cupcakes
11> Ponies
nobody actually treats it like canon though.
but the author makes it in a way that she is incredibly condescent to her character
11HOLY FUCK THAT WOULD BE EPIC!
If I ever get ahold of a time machine i will go back and end who ever came up with this song.
I'd rather see Fluttershining?
I didn't really think it was scary, but Higurashi + Ponies? ... No thank you
No not the CUPCAKES!!
each time I hear this song I think of an extremely awesome tribute vid I once saw
11Rainbow Dash!
Something Broke: The Continuing Tale Of Pinkie Pie and Ponycide by george desroches
>I just realised we watched 2 videos in a row with the same song
noo Dash!
Don't do it!
4If Hipster were here, he'd probably kick/ban the person who requested this
RUN RAINBOW< ITS A TAP
6Probably.
I despise grimdark.
Where is Hipster anyway?
I KNEW IT!
It will be made.
Most over used song in all of time and space.
The Fluttershining.
6Not here atm.
It WILL be made.
Thats one movie I dont want to see..
Grimdark can be good if done well
lol hipster be hipsterin
there's nothing you can do about it.
Sol: like in Cupcakes? :D
You cut the video short.
overused due to the fact that it was awesome and made by clint mansell?
:<
Here we go!
Wtf
(he makes the ME3 soundtrack btw)
lunar republic time!
Oh god
(also made Black Swan)
What?
Good grimdark? What about Party of None?
This was shown yesterday

There goes Ponyville
Doesn't appeal to me :P I think the guro is too flamboyant

OH HECK YEAH
HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN A WHILE
is incredibly similar to new ponyville
lol
FOR THE LUNAR REPUBLIC
gee, they sure had advanced technology in old ponyville
Sad is fine. Hell, I'm writing a sad fanfic (well it starts out sad anyway) but grimdark is going too far
and I love how y'all are like STOP DISLIKING WHAT I LIKE!!!
LAWL
Hahahaha
Dat face
Flutteryay: That's me all over. :P
I'm yelling stop forcing opinions myself
celestias challenge accepted face
you see the problem is your reading fanfic

Oh man

This is fucking epic
Orbital friendship laser!
Some srs stuff ITC
AWWW YEAAAHHHHHH
gotcha
Firing the Orbital Friendship Cannon
Oh man
the world was destroyed.
i think there's a place for grimdark, if it's handled well. It's only natural that, while we all love the show, we would be intriuged with taking it to more adult/dark places.
l;ol
XD
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LUNA!!!!!!!
Overkill Much?
Thanks Prince.
/me saves Luna
/me hugs Luna
that is the most epic thing i have seen this year
No such thing as overkill
Celestia blew herself up then?
good grimdark, FO:E?
The problem is when people treat it as canon
I'm sick of having Cupcakes shoved in my face
This music rustles my jimmies
:P
What's it titled?
MLP Fanfic
:P
Celestia fixes everything
OK, good grimdark might be good but I've only read bad grimdark
flutteryay, you read Fallout equestria yet?
Go look at the video Sol, it should say.
flutteryay I've yet to meat a single brony who treats cupcakes as canon
Hey Sol, X-Ray Dog -- Night Hounds -- Last Chance
Luna kills a few. Celestia murders everyone.

It's a Touhou Sea Pony
He ddin't put the SHOO BE DOO parts in there
MFW I don't like this kind of music at all. XD
That thing is almost 40 chapters long.
11I read that Lauren Faust intends to have Sea Ponies in Season 2
meh, really not interested in all the electronica.
I read that she intended not
Silver: WHERE
OH WAIT HE DID
I read what Derma read
Sea Ponies, oh dear
Silverscreen: Link?
I wonder if seaponies can use magic
I wish that were true, Silverscreen, but I know you be trollan.
this is good background music, not foreground
Zephirdd: they can't.
Silverscreen Oh God, that better be a lie :o
Faust intended for them to be in S1.
Sea ponies are ponies in the ocean.... that's about it. They're like sea horses.
Only Flutterponies and unicorns (flutterponies being the butterfly wing ones)
I read that she wanted to put them in there but the rest of the staff vetoed it
I wonder what would Poseidon think about MLP
But there wasn't time/resources or something.
Its Lauren Faust if she can make regular ponies cool she can make sea ponies cool
as in, Poseidon the greek god
I lways thought Flutterponies were the Ten Million Fluttershies across Equestria
Faust said there'd be no sea ponies in S"
S2*
nah, Rarity was turned into a flutterpony temporarily in Sonic Rainboom
Faust isn't here for S3 remember ^_^
Then the mod just lied to me
Season 3 is in the balance.
well, Flutterpony with a unicorn horn (they don't have that)
OH YES

Probably even S2 clips.
you are in the denial phase.
that's why
Denial phase of what?
you just prove it
ponies
hehehehee
Nope.
That was ages ago.
Months.
What am I fighting FORRRR!!!
I'm pretty sure you're bright enough to figure it out by yourself.
cupcakes?
I never went through a Denial phase. I loved ponies as soon as I watched the first episode
YAY
I'm just in a mood where nothing can impress me right now.
6lol this again
YES
05yay
Because one thing I know: Somethings are worth fighting for.
best quote ever imo
it sounds like rainbow too
ILOVEYOUILOVEYOUILOVEYOUILOVEYOUILOVEYOUILOVEYOUILOVEYOU
Well I normally love this
But meh.
That's why I love this
whats this pmv's name anyway?
I wish there were more videos that sounded like RD singing

Dat EQD post
COMICS!!!!
offspring sounds slow after I heard this
Go meh at that, I dare you
>_>
Meh.
He's just an actor.
I probably would like this song so much more if I hadn't heard it along with the rest of Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace
lol
LOL that 2nd comic is gold
Prince-trololo: David Tennant.
Was this sped it up to make it sound like RD?
>mfw I posted the 2nd comic here on this chat yesterday
*sniff* That Scootaloo comic hits my heart strings where it hurts...
too late, Dermathil :P
sped up by 20% to sound like rainbow dash
uncanny.
lol
you made me laugh
robotpinkie, too late to what?
Lemons, really? wow, lol
what you mean?
no seriously, it's sped up by 20%
mORE PONY POLKA!
For David Tennant, already linked to a pic of him
What the fuck am I watching
It took me a while to figure out what the cutie marks were and when I did I LOL'D hard
OH
why is legs BROKEN AHHH
so the pic mustve derped for me.
Dawww, scoots
Prince-trololo: Matt Smith.
Fuck yeah pony polka
(testing him)
8bit Ponies!
Meh.
He went "meh" to that too :P
oh my
Also just an actor.
....
/me pumps the volume and dances
Meh is spreading!
Woah, he's worse than anticipated. He didn't hate on him!
what's weird about that first comic is that I actually brought up Scoot's parents in my NaPoWriMo fic.
Why so meh?
*hums along*
Wow, prince-trololo called Matt Smith an ACTOR... this is serious business
hem!
Dash army ftw.
MY GOD, you're right RP
matt smith is best doctor?
wtf is a matt smith
BSOD
dat blue screen o death
matt smith is best doctor
Oh wow
oh man
lol
SHIPOOPI!
...
Meh.
BBL
no?
aww
...................
everyone knows Colin Baker is best doctor
Bag of weed
Bag o weed!
Bufurd: an 11th doctor that's got shitty acting skills in comparison with Tennant
Ogod this song
MEH.
Oh crud, a doctor fight....David Tenant *runs*
shipoopi > bag of weed
I was hoping it was the old bamboo.
Hmm…should try watching My Little Pony while high...
sarcasm Dermathil, is it a foreign language?
RAWRity: actually, I've seen that 90% of the Dr who fandom say Tennant was best
THE GIRL YOU'LL NEVER GET
i might do that SuperBrony64
Oops forgot the other n
would be my 1st time so would make it even better
dermathil I know, I was referencing the fact that tone of Who fans hate Baker
though I think they said baker was in the top spots
DashWithRainbow: Will make the show 100s of times better!
mute
Family Guy is only good for songs nowadays
6A BAG OF WEED A BAG OF WEED
probably because they re-evaluated him in light of Matt Smith
6...this is like my theme song.
That explains why Pinkie acts like that
family guy will occasionally get a funny joke by pure chance.
well now we know what your sprinkles are SirSprinkles
Sprinkles... o-o
Actually, weed is a depressant
Haah
family guy isn't even funny.
This
AWWW YEAH!
YESA
oooh don't stop believing
Here we go again
AWW YEAH
JUST A SMALL TOWN GIRL
JUST A SMALL TOWN GIRL
If anything, Pinkie would do meth or speed

TAKIN THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO ANYWHERE
SHE TOOK THE MIDNGITH TRAIN GOING ANYWHERE
HE TOOK A SHIT RIGHT ANYWHERE
JUST A CITY BOY
BORN AND RAISED IN SOUTH DETROIT
BORN AND RAISED IN SOUTH DETROIT!
never really liked this song. Don't see what's so great about it.
HE TOOK THE MIDNIGHT TRAIN TO ANYWHERE
A BAG OF WEED A BAG OF WEED
The moon is pretty outside.
good singing RAWRity
They told me I could take the midnight train anywhere. SO I TOOK IT TO EQUESTRIA
Why are the trains pulled by Ponies?!
What's the point of the locomotive in the front then
>implying the Moon isn't always beautiful
bufurd you mean that screeching bat that got caught in the recording booth?
its a childrens show SuperBrony64
^
don't question it
…And trains are bad for kids?!
just roll with it
there are quite a few mistakes in animation and stuff but kids dont notice it
ight guys
you have to keep up the image in their minds, to a kid a train withought an engine would look like nothing
superbrony64 because they still need the train whistle, ofcourse!
We do
THE MAJORITY OF THE VIEWERS
-_______-
well that was more done to make the story make more sense
... I don't >:
6I shall return, it is time for a smoke...
WHY?!
their priority is the primary audience
if anyone has steam and would like to win some free shit, join the Brony State steam group, follow my instructions in the comment I made, and then I'll draw tomorrow.
IE not us.
there is no machinery in equestria
^
:\
It would have made just as much sense, if not more, if the train would work the way it was supposed to!
Applejack has a truck.
07again?
there is a fuel crisis in equestria
super just ask the celestia damn writers/animators
Pinkie Pie gets a jet engine in Season 2
/me hugs Luna
That's not magic >_<
yeah Luna
i do it weekly.
As it says in my comment and in the group.
Train is made of dark matter. Problem solved
superbrony64 there's just some things you don't question. Its not like this is trying to be high fantasy
pinkie doesn't get a jet engine in s2... right?
right?
BUT THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THE PONIES PULL THE TRAIN
i thought that pic was fan made
combustiblelemons you never know with her.
No machinery?...*thinks about it*....OBJECTION! In Pinkie's House There's a oven so there is machinery!
not really
not really complex machinery
Only ponies make that song likable to me
its just heat in a box
superbrony64 it's just there for a joke man,
not fucking rocket science
Osnap, Under Pressure!
It's called suspension of disbelief. If anything, it was done to keep the atmosphere of Ponytechnology in place
Queen!
equestria is riddled with inconsistencies, for instance pinkie states that she eats hot dogs after saying she is vegitarian
could be a log burning stove
RAWRity: you win!
No need to bust a nut
wat
SuperBrony64: They aren't pulling the train. Some asshole tied them to the front of it, they're running to avoid getting run over.
Lol
and.... mute
lol
Herospirit: OH NOOOOOOOOOOO
Fuck sleep, watch ponies.
wtf?
Eeyup
05way to ruin a great song
Lol herospirit
huh, this is half a good song
I lold
Combustiblelemons: done that for a whole week
and the other half is Vanilla Ice
what wrek said
Combustiblelen: Sleep at 7 PM? You 5 years old lol?
Watch sleep, fuck... oh nvm
people say you hallucinate due to lack of sleep
lmfao herospirit
05queen isnt near good enough to be played with the awesoemness that is vanilla ice
all i hallucinated was ponies
any of you guys seen the Vanilla Ice movie "Cool As Ice"?
>best thing in my life so far
....
Its true DashWithRainbows, I attempted it once
It's all true Combustiblelemons
PONY TIME
Wrek is traollan hard
Nice trollan, Wrek.
RAWRity, I saw the NC review of it
^
Go ninja go ninja go
it's pretty fucking strange.
Fun fact: Hallucinations happen because your brain is dying.
Dat falsetto
makes less sense than Rocky Horror
hallucinations are awesome though D:
Am I the only one who hates Snips and Snails?
YES
aslong as they are scary as fuck
NOPE
NEW CHAPTER OF A WORLD WITHOUT RAINBOWSD
There meh
SuperBrony64 hahaha u so funny
only had one as a kid with a terrible fever.
and I just noticed it
you guys know that sound of your ears ringing? That's the sound of cells in your ear dying.
So I went to TGI fridays today
brb readin
I had a Jack Daniels burger
TGI Fridays?! LOLOL What is that?!
MFW THAT BURGER WILL MAKE ME AN ALCOHOLIC
try jack daniels sryup
Confound those burgers!
Dag Janiels
get wasted at breakfast
Allis, so delicious
Lol, YT
I was alright with Snips and Snails, but I was worried they'd be how the show would present Males for a little bit
YES
So by your logic Burgers = Alcohol....*goes to Mcdonalds*
Best Song
No, you'll make me sleepy!
Dem pipes
sweete belle, Y U NO LET FLUTTERSHY SING THE SONG?!?
Sweetie belle is the queen of soul
Yay! Sweetie Belle time
and yet she still doesn't get her Cutie Mark
Sweetie Belle is amazing
Darf14: The burger has jack daniels in it
what
YES
DAMN YOU SME
Yay
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
O.O
My body is ready
We just resorting to a random playlist?
yup mods are afk
So it's all playlist now I'm guessing, Luna?
Wow, didn't know that they do that AllisZeor, sounds interesting
POST PONIES
what are we wqtching?
oh wait
I go for a little bit, and come back to this

MODS ARE SLEEPIN! POST PONIES!!
MODS ARE ASLEEP POST PONIES

SuperBrony, how scandalous

PINKIE PIE, YOU FILTHY FILLY!
sent the note to max a while ago
lol
*phew* thank gosh
couldn't log back in though
Oh god this comic
WHY DID THIS COMIC JUST MAKE ME LIKE SCOOTALOO
YOU SO LATE ALLISZERO
what comic, AllisZero?
the music I'm istening to right now somehow fits this pmv.
But I agree
You can bet there'll be a resurgence of Pony threads in /co/ and /b/ once season 2 starts. If for nothing else than to bitch about it
Scootaloo is awesome
gonna check if she replied now
doesn't show up for me :(
Honestly I never cared much for her
alliszero because Scoots is a ton of fun?
Me neither
RARITY XXXX OH WHAT A FILTHY SLUT CLICK THIS LINK http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGx2isMivXs
6Am back
First post on EQ, RP
same here, hate it when that happens
its eqdailies comic, go to eqdaily
Neither does SuperBrony's
Hi Octavia
oh hai Octavia
okay, thanks AllisZero
A wild Octavia appears
lol Sol, damn she's so smooth
13I've been here the whle time lol
13But FF is crapping out on me
Nice try sol, I am not being fooled this time
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF THIS SONG
LOL FIREFOX
Octavia: Use a real IRC client :P
13Yup, my favorite browser.
>2011
and that is adorable, AllisZero
>still uses FF
13And I'd rather just use Mibbit, makes it easier on me.
Hate on firefox, but we don't have to deal with ads :3
Firefox is the best
I knowww
Any bad song + ponies = notbad.jpg
though I already like Scoota :P
Chrome ftw.
its not bad RAWRity, there is singing
13Ew, Chrome
:I
Ewwwww
I don't have to deal with ads either, Sol >.>
13I only use Chrome is FF is dead
CROME FOREVER
bufurd that doesn't make it any less shit.
Could be worse, it could be IE
stupid hipsters...
6I switch between Chrome and FF, because they both have seperate uses.
LAWL
FF is for pimps
I'm with Sprinkles
>"still uses firefox"
Chrome incognito mode, what would I do without you.
>"stupid hipsters"
(╯°□°）╯︵ɐıʌɐʇɔo
Safari is for bosses
YES
FF7 Beta is my favorite
AAAAAAAW YYEEEAAAHH
awww yeah!
EQUESTRIA GIRLS!
>people give a fuck about browsers still
Hi Octavia, I'm a Programmer. I use chrome because it's superior by developer standards.
Did someone say..... Nigel version?
CRANK UP DA VOLUME!
BRONY HOLLAH!!
WE NEED NIGEL
>acknowledged
>every brony feels epic
j
soooo.... how taboo is a carnivore in Equestria?
Whoever did this dub is a master at PMV LOLOLOL
Yep
hmm....dont feel epic
berospirit probably very
ololol
Not even Japan's anime industry gives otaku so much credit as FIM gives bronies
(╯°□°）╯︵Octavia
Octavia, Firefox is nothing without the gajillion addons.
FLIPPED AGAIN
13lol
I imagine a carnivore in Equestria is like a cannibal here
13I only have a few addons
6I use Chrome when I'm streaming, because it's less of a resource hog. I use FF a lot though.
OH GOD MY EARS!!
THEY'RE BLEEDING
Chrome is a bigger resource hog from my experience
I have a good amount of add-ons, all security related
SAFARI IS FO BAWSES
I only use Chrome for incognito mode
Sometimes I have 3-4 chrome instances with 200-500 megs each
Chrome has greasemonkey built in and everything, no need to have resource-hogging stuff.
i use chrome because google allready knows everything about me, dont need firecrash to know also
I think the acknowledgement of bronies was a brilliant move by Hasbro, because they helped make bronies feel appreciated, and much more likely to stick with the show.
this client doesn't let me cycle channels
internet explorer is for newfags.
wat do
sweet
13lol
:|
Lets all just band together and rag on the idiots still using IE
NO
^
I like FF7 because it doesn't use as much resources and starts up faster
Let's all band against the Brony Haters who USE IE
IE people are begging to get viruses
let's just hate on all the Opera users
What's this song called? :0
Yes
Firefox all the way
OHWAIT WHERE ARE THEY?
Hate on IE
opera is actually very underrated
firefox is good
07live and learn
internet explorer's security is like a wall made of swiss cheese
lol
13Then get luvs!
opera is the hipsters' browser.
Opera is nice.
Nightly is hipster Firefox
What about obscure browsers?
....I probably should've been able to guess that, huh, Luna?
I only have adblock and web developer addons, Bjornfot. Do explain how I'm supposed to have that functionality in Chrome without installing two addons.
I feel like we just watched a Season 1 Marathon after watching all these videos -___-
07:)
IE: Only good for downloading other browsers.
I dont even use a browser, I RUN LINUX
One reason IE Security is flawed is that its integrated into the OS
lol
Linux HA.
>NO SIR YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
then why are you not using chrome, robotpinkie? it's much faster and reliable
I DON'T HAVE A MAC ADDRESS, I USE WINDOWS
I use my own browser I invented when I was 14, called internet exterminator. you've probably never heard of it.
I have Linux as well WE ARE SUPREME!
/me is using chromium
also, can you edit html directly in firefox?
Yay Luna!
lolllzzz, i uze safari XDD
no
THIS CHAT IS NOW A BROWSER WAR
I don't like the interface of Chrome(ium)
AND THIS BIKE IS A PIPE BOMB
agreed
13I dont mind FF being a bit of a resource hog because my higher end computer doesnt even notice it and neither do I.
i get anywhere i want to go in less than 4 keystrokes
Inspect Element is the best browser-thing ever
*set topic to CHROME IS BEST BROWSER EVAH*
I'd say join #browserwar but there's not much else being discussed here
*adds fuel to the flame war* hehehe
13lol
I surf the web with my mind.
(╯°□°）╯︵ɐıʌɐʇɔo
Firefox has best mascot
13Ghost in The Shell!
The only advantage of having IE is that you get to rag on the idiots using Safari
Inspect element doesn't come close to the full functionality of web developer...
SirReginald: Alphas/GitS much?
LOL FAGS
somebody should create a pony web browser
what does chrome have?
Dang it 'Tavi
not a fan of this music.
Nope, Safari still beats IE :P
NETSCPAE IS OBVIOUSLY BEST BROWSER
a dumb circle
I use Safari, because it is made by Apple and Applejacks likes Apples and I like Applejack U KNOOOOOO!!!!
and it makes EQD your homepage
The more you know!
I USE LYNX
I'm just that powerful.
lol
REAL MEN USE NETSCAPE
ya LYNX
Firefox > Chrome > Other Browsers >>>>>>>>> IE
Bufurd just exploded!
NOOOOO
poor IE
lol
13WB :D
MORE EPICNESS
Chrome is neat, Bjornfot, but it's not THAT much better than FF yet
Uh oh
Emo song time
In actuality, I use FF and Chrome
<3 Octavia
aw fuck I hate this song.
When Chrome has all the stuff I rely on FF for, I may switch over fully
IE just sucks
COOOOLDPPLLLAAAAYYYYY
RAWRity: y u no appreciate good music?
13...
Y U SO COLD?!
my dad loves this song :/
what doesn't it have, freezeframe?
/me 13likes this song
bufurd i do, Coldplay ain't it
/me likes it too
COLDPLAY ROCKS :D
/me hates this song
it plays EVERY TIME i'm in his car.
/me does to
o
FTP client extension, app tabs
I do love the way Chrome handles tabs, that's srsly cool from a developer perspective.
inb4 dari hates everything
It doesn't have menus
/me begs Octavia to flip RAWRity
I used to like it, but it got really old, so fast.
/me tolerates it to an extent though
I use FF 6
cold play is easily the second most boring band I've ever come across, they're not even bad in a fun way.
SuperBrony64, I'm shocked
You just don't like ballads
13lol Bufurd ;)
Dark_Heart: Why? YOU DON'T KNOW MEEEEEEE!!!!
Do you work with programming, Bjornfot, or web development?
true
13You know who I like?
bufurd MY OPINIONS. LET ME SHOW YOU THEM.
both, robotpinkie
Me?
13U2! I love how all there stuff is so over-produced....
Dark_Heart: Care Bears reference?
13Bonus if you get the reference.
Aaw.
/me grabs #bronystates shoulders
Which programming language do you use bjornfot?
OPINIONS
OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
13Haha
13>internet
whatever is needed, darf14
cool
I should've been a programmer instead of a systems admin :|
Care BARES, cause they care but only down to stuff that they absolutely need to care about and nothing more
who's poking me?
Nobody respects systems admins!
Well, what programming languages do you LIKE to use, Bjornfot?
I mostly prefer punk rock and metal, but I still ike Coldplay
6It doesn't? Oo
(insert xkcd joke here AllisZero )
6It's usually not client specific... =/
Though I prefer to stick to C-family languages.
Yep...
If Lauren Faust took her magic to Care Bears I wouldn't know what to do with my life...
I prefer .... anything
still, Coldplay's bad, but nowhere near as bad as Coldplay
o.o
you know who I like?
I pretty much prefer C++ since its the only language I know
Ah okay... I'm kind of partial to higher level languages, cuts development time down a lot.
the prodigy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwI3cIcFEcU
more epic music videos, enough to tie the world together
Rawrity: I see what you did there
Okay, let's do a test and see what it's like
this one is epic
it's /cycle #bronystate no?
Anypony see ATLA?
CARE BEARS 20% LOVABLE SHARING IS CARING OMG
but seriously, if I can give coldplay anything, at least they're not Nickelback
Nah, doesn't work out
13Yes
wtf british?
30 years now?
My Little MythBusters
makes sence, they did one for top gear.
pony mythbusters?
Man I remember when it was still 20 years!
that's not the Mythbusters, those are the MythPonies!
British voice?
RobotPinkie, that completely depends on what I'm doing. I often go "learn" (aka, look up the structure and built in functions) a new language just because I think it might do the job better.
why is tory not dash?
yeah
Mythbusters with Ponys, Ponys don't have Myths lol
Pinkie Pie would be a test dummy...
OH YES
YES
and rarity kari?
YES
YES
still getting "unknown command" at my end
YES
DR WHOOVES!!!!! YA
ALLON SI
ALLON-SY
13What are you using?
what
Fail
also
olol
What was that sound from?
jmIRC (mobile IRC client)
Doctor Who
Hate it.
WE'RE PONIES ON THE MOON
Well, that's a good way of doing it, Bjornfot, as long as you don't have to switch languages too often.
GO WATCH SOM ALREADY
here's the note I sent to madmax
no, not fail, Darf14. The original scene is much more awesome since he does it with a space ship.
WE CARRY OUR HARMONIES!
Not sure if guy or girl
13Ahhh, shoot. I've never used the mobile version of mIRC before. But I would certainly think it would let you cycle the channel.
BUT THERE AIN'T NO LUNAS SO WE SING OUR HAPPY TUNE
I did not, in fact, receive your previous note. Did it contain any information not included in the current one?
*continues listening to invaders must die*
07is there a mirc for ipad too?
True, but in this case he sank a boat
http://miburl.com/Ps5FYA
Hmm what song is this?
07ponies on the moon
this was like 45 minutes ago
What is that line from about the Criminal Scum?
THEY CARRY A HARPOON
13Hmm, well, shes probably busy.
oh my this is gooooood
13So may be a while before we hear from her.
For example, RobotPinkie, the Dating Sim uses Ren'Py, which is a mark-up language, but also supporting most of Python. I didn't know any of that before. But I looked it up, saw it would be pretty simple to learn and applied for the job.
Rainbow, I should've been playing oblivion since hours ago
haven't gotten a reply, hopefully she decides to enter the channel (and becomes a regular...)
but ponies :(
indeed
no rush
7:34 PM?! PONY TIME!
that said
13But the message looks good. Though you didnt mention anything about possible background ponies thrown in if she has the time. :P But oh well. Other than that, it looks good to me.
we have a lot of regulars now, ja?
alright
i know right Natleyn? need to go play css... but ponies
Hm, I know Natleyn
superbrony64 Y SO WEST COAST
3:34 AM? pony time!
im going to sleep goodnight everypony
Oblivion, the only way to easily win is not to level up
that's what I want her to come
I should be playing Dead Island, or Fallout 3
13We're at 51 atm, not too shabby.
Goodnight, Ziltoid!
that way you can pitch the idea
Python is a great language, Bjornfot, perfect for scripting
It's like my mind was built for mathematics and programming... aka logic.
7:35 PM?! PONY TIME!
07I like this song
13If she has the time to join us here, that would be awesome.
Very easy to integrate with C or C++, too
>is a very good idea I go to sleep now
if I wrote it into the note, it'd sound too...abrasive
My Aspergers also help a great deal.
/me asks Luna, "who doesn't?"
3:34 AM?!? Where do you live? On MARS!!???
/me shrugs

Splooge?! lol
This isn't too bad
You mean the Smooze?
Sounds like a revolution song.
Ponies vs evil goat lord
splooge X'D
ohwow
LOL DEMOCRAT PROPAGANDA
Anything is better than that 3.5 and 3.6 shit
Why do you do this. Why do you do this to us
Is this the special prize, Luna? :P
That bell will... what?
Let's watch Party for One! <--Favorite Episode
magic bridge is magic
Not a bell! My only weakness!
???
????????????????
Bells weaken goats, its magic it needs no explanation!
you know what you should do to REALLY troll us? Put on "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
RAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH
Yeah... Smooze
No more please!
Why didn't I take that bell down?
Ohai Spike
lolololol
Why did Splooge come out?
Oh no, don't give her any ideas RAWRity
lol "hathers gonna hate"
Is that Lil from Rudgrats?
haters*
WTF?
As long its not 3.5 then I dont give a dam
Is this shit?
I am cracking up, oh god
>mfw this video has no sound in the right channel
/me agrees with Nittany_Tiger
superbrony64 at least I only requested a short one, not something like "The Princess Promenade"
Damn wizard unicorns.
3.6 is worse than 3.5
They think they're so clever.
G4>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Everything Else>G3.5>G3.6
>mfw I thought my headphones were fucked up instead of the vid
It has very little sound on the right channel, but there is SOME :P
Never heard or saw 3.6, I must watch it FOR SCIENCE!!
proto-PMVs?
seriously....
can we go back to g4
Herospirit speaks truth. Effective
sea ponies suck so bad...
This song is FANTASTIC, but not a good version
G4 > ----------- Everything else--------->a spiders web--- >G3.5 and all other generations
seaponies?!
darf14 if I'm thinkign 3.6 is what it is, then it's BABY ponies, lazily made in flash
G1 was pretty awesome
RAWRity, you're pretty much right
i dont care what you all think, this is not the ponies i want to see
What happened to G2?
N
It wasn't G4, but it had Tirac
ot that
im
in
RAWRity is correct
teres

G2 had no games.
er, shows
G2 was so bad it dissappeared?
Dear sweet God
MLP and MLP Tales were both based on the G1 toys
Now I WILL give G1 credit. It did usually have plots in it
Flutteryay, why?
Putting on some Lovin' Spoonful instead, because they were awesome :P
;_;
is she rideing pinkie pie?
I hate how Colloquy glitches on me
G2 toys never got a show, then G3 hit
oh god mlp tales D:
You know what I'm listening to?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFlXzGH2vA
MY CHILDHOOD
So that blonde girl…she supposed to be a humanized version of Applejack?
Pinkie was originally going to have wings
G1 was still kind of sickening at times, but it's infinitely better than 3.5
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT
No, that's Megan
That blond girl is Megan.
She'd like to be Applejack, though.
but faust said "fuck that" and so she's an earth pony now
Applejack is awesome.
But she was a farm girl.... hmmmm
That blond girl is Bacon.
wait
Pinkie was originally called "Surprise" and was a white, blond pegasus
If you believe in magic, come along with me...
Pinkie was originally Lauren's interpretation of what Surprise was, with a Surprise skin
why is it G3.5, G3.6 and nopony is talking about G3?
BACON AND APPLEJACK!
OH GOD NO!
IT'S BACON AND APPLEJACKS
idk anything about non FiM
Wow
weee!
DELICIOUS
SHOOBEDOO SHOOB SHOBEDOO CLIP
G3 wasn't so horrible it causes nightmares
dang, cant find 3.6
What the
G3 was crap, but not quite as much crap
Gen 3 was eh I guess
Seamen ponies.
THERE'S A GIANT OYSTER IN MY RIVER
fail AJ :\
hop skip jump
River is a sea?
This AJ was a clutz
LAWL
SHOO BE DOO
so THERE is where it comes from
lmao
Hence the song Silly Pony
This song isn't that bad
That AJ was a silly pony
they're both like "what the fuck is going on"
Ohai Youtube Comments.
Scooootaloo, scoot scootaloo!
Epic G1 ending to the night, Luna :P
07so guys is'nt this awesome?
07so much nostalgia
>yfw the broken bridge in part 2 of the FiM pilot could've had a similar segment if the team wanted to
It is!
07I love it
Who's a silly pony, Who's a silly Pony, who is you is Applejack!
It really is kind of surreal looking at G4 ponies compared to their G3 (or in AJ's case, G1) incarnations
I never watched MLP other than G4
Easily one of the better G1 songs I've heard
These two have no fucking idea what's going on.
/me dances with Luna
some things are best left in the past luna.
so no, no nostalgia
You can see it in their faces.
07and there's more to come
Sorry, no Nostalgia vibe from me, maybe because I was born in the late 80's
07*trollface*
the only face i have is a confused one
BACON AND APPLEJACK
...
luna... no. no luna.
Yeah, I didn't quite watch this as a kid
You can't possibly troll me, Luna :3
SHOOOOOOBIE DOO SHOOP SHOOP DA WHOOP!!!
So no nostalgia for me.
Luna, Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel adventure better be in there.
Just WAT
THESE ARE NOT THE PONIES I WANT
Ohai Firefly
We really reached the bottom of the playlist barrel...
IT BURNS

07oh yes

/me dances with VioletVanilla
No, lose our lunch!
i have CS:s to play
C'mon, this isn't too bad actually. Not GOOD, but far from excruciating.
/me *mutes*
I need something to justify not doing my homework!
G4 RD is G1 Firefly's brain in G3 RD's body
/me plays timewarp
Oh great the torture playlist, if it was a 3.5 playlist then it will be torture Russian Style!
FreezeFrame, have you seen G3 RD's body?
yes, RAWRity, not bad, but we could be waching GOOD
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
That ain't our Dashie.
The updated art style
Da fuck is dat

RAINBOW DASH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SPEED, SHE LOVES FASHION!
timewarp makes this at the very least twice as bearable
dead modchat is dead
G1 Supports Hobos
little hobo?
Firefly's mind
LAWL
oh god this is hilarious
...what is going on?
/me dances with Violet and RobotPinkie
EVERYONE, HERE IS OUR SUPPORT. LET IT SAVE YOUR SANITY
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7u3nhANa4
/me dances with RobotPinkie and Luna~ ;D
why can this guy not sing?
My Little Hobo, My Little Hobo, ah ah ah aaaaaaaah
So are they supporting bringing a hobo home?
what the fuck is this
paradice estate?
why isn't he rapping instead?
this is so silly that its awesome!
That hobo is a walking plague.
I want the hobos around my house to go away >:
Sol, PM
CAPITAL IDEA!
6,0This all sounds so good. . . Hope she can come here.
A punk zebra?
... that Zebra.
What the hell>?
Hang on, let me fire up IRC
This is actually the first time I've seen G1 stuff
6,0Instead of falling asleep and staying asleep, I woke up again. . .
that a cloud god?
zecoras ancestor
so, G4 ponies fight dragons and hydras. G1 fight clouds and zebramen?
is that
6,0And suddenly had some tune in my head. . .
HAHA, HOHO, HEEHEE, TO THE FUNNY FARM
...a pokemon?
Thundurus I believe?
Tornadus
A song about eating shadows.
6,0So, I ran to my double bass and began searching for the tune in my head. ..
the funny farm song is from MLP?
Tasty…tasty shadows
A zebra pimp?
I don't see any shadows...
they ate them duh
6,0It came together, and I made an epic search for what on earth it was. ..
SUDDENLY DUTCH ANGLES
lolno, Bufurd, though it would fit with this :P
Shadow eaters...where have I heard of that before?
Megan walks so robotically in that scene.
Seriously, coherence wasn't very important in the 80s was it
Now the left channel is messed up
The most powerful creature in Ponyland?!
now it's only out of the right channel?
6,0My tale ended in a surprise as I clicked on a link aaaaannnnndddd. . .
Wait
PONYLAND?
To hell with the left audio channel
Wow, this is cheesy
Making volcanoes erupt on command? That's actually pretty impress-
>ice guy, bathes in lava
...
not ONLY right channel, just... mostly
Rainbow light.
...this song's tune reminds me of Saddam Hussein's song in the South Park movie
6,0I had "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice stuck in my head. .-.
Crystal, I think
Ponyland? So that's why there's humans in there, its not Equestria
where life is beutiful all the time, and ill be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, they are comming to take me away Haha!
it think it's diamond guy
RAWRity: I think this is the base for the SP song
6,0Needless to say. . . I now know "Ice Ice Baby" on the double bass.
Ponyland is located near Manehatten
Those villain songs
Celestia killed all the humans when she took the throne, darf14.
all I could do during that was think "I CAN CHANGE!"
or banished them to the Earth
A rainbow of light!
Tony Randall! <3
A Rainbow of Light!
rainbows... they are not all made of light
RAINBOW OF LIGHT? LIKE THERE'S ANY OTHER?
Youre good at your pony history Bjornfot
/me is still listening to the timewarp
A little piece of rainbow? ew.
is there a rainbow made of antimatter?
/me is listening to Something Broke
Don't forget that the G1 pilot had Tirac, who could turn anypony into an evil dragon under his control.
/me is not watching these troll videos
is this a dwarf?
Bufurd: That song is scary
I'd rather Rainbow keep herself in one big piece, thank you very much.
This show is almost enjoyable with timewarp
Well we know there's liquid rainbows
SEX WITH PONIES
PUT IT ON
NAO
Sex with Ponies?! WHAAAAA--
FreezeFrame: that song is awsome
Flutteryay, send to Sola, because of IRCfail
This isn't a troll video, it's TONY MOTHERFUCKING RANDALL singing! :P
It is a dwarf...no relations to my name...*gulp*
Yes, it's awesome.
It's still scary as all fuck
the only song that has ever made me cry
>Sex with Ponies.

I think I heard this tune somewhere
its something about lucky star iirc
jump and hug in a non-sexual way right?
or there is some lucky star vid on it
Darf: It's from touhou, so its everywhere
There's a lucky star video.

:|
Which game is it from?
I WOULD TOTALLY HUG A PONY IN A NONSEXUAL WAY.
05i do hope you know what its reffering to
desert: Touhou. :l
Touhou?
But which one?
I heard this exact tune from Mc roll, and thanks Natleyn for telling me the original source
Uhhh. Idunno
Night of Nights

Okay, sounds good

Luna, link to that wallpaper you have?
epic wallpaper
desert: Night of Knights is a Cool&Create remix of Flowering Night, which is from Phantasmagoria of Flower View

/me hopes for something
thanks
I'm going to bed, thanks so much for awesome stream, Luna, I don't think I've ever gotten so many requests through :D

05ah ok

07nighty Wrek
05gona fall asleep to lament
05nn all!
05*engages lurk/sleep mode*
07herospirit you die-hard!
Bye Wrek!
^_^
Ciao Wrek.
Can't sleep, head filled with pony
Later Wrek
6,0nn!
Night Wrek~~~~
Cain't sleep, spah will sap mah sentry.
Hahaa.
13G'night Wrek!
Can't sleep; if we don't behold Luna's moon and stars she'll be sad.
Best reason to stay up.
The moon is beautiful tonight
If you want an excuse to go outside
07it always is
I know I did!
damn where are the pegasi
The crescent moon kinda hates me
I love the moon
too many clouds here
-_-
I'd go outside, but every moment I'm not watching my sentry is a moment for that spy to act.
So full moon and I are bros
He's watching me.
All the time.
still raining here >_<
I love the rain!
Sumica, grab a bucket and collect some rain for me.
I'll pay you in hugs.
/me saps Dragon's sentry while he's distracted by rain
13I still cannot believe the amount of publicity EqD is giving The Brony Show and Bronyville right now. You couldn't ask for better publicity. lol
I noticed it tonight and just sat there in awe at its beauty. Its a shame that people are always in such a rush and never stop and look around.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
byee Luna
Uh oh, broadcast is dead
<3
/me 13shakes fist angerly at Seth
/me hugs Luna
Why is the broadcast gone?
/me cries into his bottle of Applejack.
07oops
/me glomps Luna
07wait!
Luna HOW COULD YOU!?
oh no.
07you want to listen the album?
Why is the why is the broadcast?
/me jumps off bridge
I come back and luna runs
/me remembers he's on DragonRage's side, and sapping therefore does nothing
Fack.
its cause Luna is on the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAH
Luna, can we listen to that playlist you played yesterday on YouTube?
Streaming Avenue Q?
LUNA
I've grown very fond of it XD
07yessss
YOU ROCK
07thanks
I'm confused...
07to be honest i'm pretty upset about it too...
I wonder how they managed it...
13Just... tlaks and negotiations I guess.
07so who wants this album on?
I'm out now
13Or maybe someone is friends with Tek, Seth, Phoe or Cereal.
07oh god..
6,0They must be. . .
07this song
6,0SENT TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!! DDDD<
07THE SONG
Reminds me of the worthless song from that toaster cartoon
I would like the YouTube playlist
07I cant put that on atm
07doing some administration
Violet, I'll prepare the Aquarion's TO DA MOOOONAAAAH pawnch
That's fine >_>
07but I can stop broadcasting ;)
13lol :P
13Oh, u silly fillies.
07I just think it's a little unfair...
Vhose: okay shoot... but not at me
13I agree Luna.
thatonepony yes
i have.
then you are awesome
...I...I don't hold that against anypony, but it did make me uncomfortable...
Ungupulate. Should technically be the pony word, but wow, that's an ugly word.
and on a related note
oh
wait
no
i played 8
13Did either The Brony Show or Bronyville contact us to be apart of it at all? I'm guessing not.
Could only find the dog
someone is hacking the game to make it pony
It's okay, Discord, hoofpulate didn't sound much better.
13VV I think it was and I were bitching about it for a while last night too. lol
so instead of corvus it will be luna
What game?
I only play games not on nintendo consoles ;-;
and other stuff like that
That was my favorite song from Brave Little Toaster~
more pony themes
MANE6
13But I cant believe we're supposed to be affiliates with the Brony Show kinda and they wouldn't even mention it to us.
neat, huh djmidli?
Fluttershy's my favorite
Oh god brave little toaster
...s-sorry Fluttershy..
ew
nasty
whoa
childhood nightmares, successfully loaded
seriously
It was quite depressing
yeah dude
or lady
someones hacking DQ for ponies.
thats sweet.
YEAH and its awesome
We didn't even know they had an event coming, so it's not as though we could contact them about it.
looks as good graphically as the game normally does
hello everyone
Hey.
Theyr
oddly natural
Theyre hacking DQ to post ponies?
its gonna be odd story wise
hmm
sounds like I missed something juicy :P
Im a dude. http://fav.me/d3cop5u (me on deck)
this might be interesting
I watched it as a kid,combined with Thomas the tank engine. Pt me off tips and scrapyards for life
It has something to do with how she's more or less my temperamental opposite... I'm usually all loud and emotion-charged and stuff
should check back thursday
First time using this site... WHERE DA BRONIES AT
I feel like reskinning some Freespace ships and writing a campaign about the Solar Empire vs. the New Lunar Republic.
And hardly ever shy and reserved
Yo soy un jeffe
its gonna be about an angel, like a pegasis but with cerain magical ability
13I mean them contact us, Dari. Since they supposed to be affiliates of ours pretty much.
Yo
6,0I hope I was not. . . being a bishi ;A;
13*they're
07MognecioConnor you missed the show :(
most likely they won't be showing the new season
I know.
Well, most of us are gone :p
you can see where it would go from there right djmidli?
The idea so far is for a Pegasus (pegasi?) named Kite, a wannabe failure knight with low self esteem who wants to be a knight (as her Cutie Mark is a shield), but is more prone to being a crash test dummy, and she always wears a suit of clinky rusty heavy armor that makes flying tough.
Well
now I'm out
really
but before
13You're fine VV.
oh hey, the main stream is working again
Bronies are the foundation for all your My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic needs.
since it's a channel for preschoolers, not bronies
But I was saying it's not as though they could have thought the onus was on us to contact them.
07bye Zephirdd
and I'd recognize that wallpaper anywhere :P
Bye Zephirdd! :<
Luna, I do think you should listen to Samuel L Jackson
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v6BipcdfJo
07Sweet dreams
So welcome to the herd!
As we didn't know they were doing an event.
and go the f* to sleep, how can you handle it lol
Later Sephirdd
bye bye :D
I sware it's like cox knows I want to see next Saturdays schedule and are refusing to update it.
hmm
does make me wonder if my friend watches it
/me hugs everypony
kite should get stuck in a tree (no stupid fluttershy jokes)
/me hugs Zephirdd
13The what was on us? lol
I never understood the Solar Empire/Lunar Republic thing...They would never fight against each other...
Vhose: sounds like an idea I had except with an Unicorn whose armor kept getting carved up by her horn like a can opener but ya good concept I never design cutie marks for any of mine for soem reason I guess I forget.
Some ponies just try and put war in everything.
Hmm…how do you do the fancy quit messages when you leave the chat?
Sounds nice, but she should get a bone thrown at her every once in a while.
13I would think they would have invited us perhaps those as guests at least or something, y'know?
thatonepony: I see what you did there
Going to bed. Bye everyone
Night.
Night Rainbow_Dash
...Friendly fire buzzes me heh
violence is human nature. they thrive on it
Dat...
Whatever that noise was.
Violet: of course you weren't a bishi. I mean, aren't you supposed to be a bishou, anyways?
Bloop
Dee: ya but not ponies slly
8silly
shad i wasnt making a joke
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps mexican|afk
*silly
Probably when someone leaves a chat, the client made that sound.
Night Rainbow_Dash!
You've never heard that before Octavia?
I know bad things happen but...
13"onus" Nada.
<.< Ponies are Differnt, they resolve issues with kindness
not stupid fluttershy stupid comment stupid stupid
Onus - the responsibility
i just never got the whole scootaloo chicken and fluttershy tree thing
You seem to be always a second too late at saying goodbye Natleyn >.>
Or duty or something
inb4 sluts
/me begins walking towards thatonepony with a hatchet.
13New term to me.
Thanks; I was thinking her conflict wouyld mainly be thinking the shield meant she was SUPPOSED to be a Knight, when reality it's more of a symbol for her to protect others in her own way, and she'd have to come to realize this, and get over her rock bottom self esteem at the same time.
yeah, ponies love and tolerate the &%(# out of you
Just people being ridiculous, thatonepony.
13But still. Not even an invite.
scootaloo looks like a chicken
Well, it's really based on the alternate character interpretation of Celestia. Some think she's a cruel tyrant.
/me Glares at Thatonepony
-lightly annoyed- ...S..so what if I sometimes think it would be nice being a tree?
6,0hai hai, bishoujo ^^; I just use bishi for fun. . .
spin i dont need a hatchet
It's pronounced owe-nus.
why would you type lightly annoyed?
13Like "hey, we're doing this awesome marathon and we thought maybe we could have someone from Brony state as a special guest"
/me is confused
Bushido?
I wonder what I should do about my hungry problem...
Well, I am now because Oblivion >.>
07what's going on?
W-what if dogs started to pee on you for feing a tree Fluttershy? D:
thatonepony: Its not for you.
i love fluttershy´s face right no
I'm back baby
w
lol don't ask me, I'm completely lost :P
Dark_Heart! You're back!
B..because it's how I feel.
ITS FOR FLUTTERHSY!!
then why would you bring it to me?
kinda pointless
Hello again random internet stranger!
13Just talking about The Brony show Mareathon still. lol
you want to hurt fluttershy???
WUZ UP!!!!!!
Why am I tired, it's not even 11 here
Dang that bloop
*sigh* Is this guy for real?
you can't express emotion on internet easily, you gotta be like the Elcor on here
hi dee
so what are we watching
what is this 'glare' you do?
6,0DCD and I are just speaking Japanese while Octavia and Dari are talking about the Brony Show.
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
-shies away behind Spin-
Hmm…I should really go grab some nourishment for my hunger...
we need muffins
Either way, thanks for the feedback foalks!
>mfw I had no idea dari even had a different nick
13I'm just kinda surprised we didn't even get an invite for someone from here to be a special gurst for the mareathon. Especially considering the "affiliates" thing. Kinda like a slap if you ask me.
it just...looked right
But then again, I should also be working...
:P
>_> do it
13lol
hey will the Hub announce what the title of the s2 episode will be?
dis song
you misspelled thats flutters
lol
Return of Harmony I think
it is 'shys'
I am not liking thatonepony right now.
the hell
what?
Still have Materials HW, Thermodynamics HW, and an Organic Chemistry Quiz all next week :/
why?
Its shies
i glare to signifiy anger and annoyance in your general vicinity, lol
lol, this song is da bomb
2,14 what's better is that if you see this show live, they literally have the puppets have sex
hmm
Nownow, love and tolerate
that is almost as abrasive as fluttershy
07I knew Val would love this!
Really?
2,14 lol
Yeah, it's definitely "shies" when in reference to a pony.
I seee
I would love to see this show live
Well, i saw some stuff before!
2,14 I love musicals, period. The fact that Avenue Q is utterly hillarious is just icing on the cake :P
But I don't live in Manehatten
thatonepony: You insult Fluttershy that is almost untolerable
play the video
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be the cause of all this trouble...
4I can understand where Octavia's frustration is coming from. Still, Sprinkles say he and CircuitMane are in contact every other week so I can only imagine that things must be fairly amicable between us and them.
i dont insult anyone
fictional or otherwise
The first Broadway musical I ever saw was Mary Poppins and I fell in love with it
And yet...
Its not Fluttershy's fault just this kid is being quite annoying
07Well.. how do we get a banner on the frontpage?
what?
who is?
well, Octavia's point still stands (as I understand it) why weren't we invited?
hiya danny man
Charging Orbital Friendship Cannon....
thats what I'm talking about
you'd think they'd at least mention it to us
what it?
we probably can't
is*
we're an episode stream
/me tried to power up the Orbital Friendship Cannon
Okay you know what I'm gonna fix this the easy way
07we are far more then that...
sort of illegal if you think about it
how?
hi hi
Now the fluttershy fans shall join together to defend her honor as the Great RainbowDash did before us.. lol
how are ya danny man?
Great
Through meaningful dialogue?
So hurray for Soundtracks!
Tired
They could have invited us to talk or something though.
cool
why ya tired?
EqD would probably NOT want to put our banner at the front page
nice pony ^
brb
who is?
U SILLY
>MFW they put up news items on us which has us on the front page
aw thanks danny man
What's the difference?
They still show it in Vegas SuperBrony64
from what it sounds like, it seems more like Sprinkles and Circuitmane keep in contact a lot, but in a more "unofficial" way
My sister screaming in my ears generally is enough to make me tired XD
i try to be nice to all
13They may be. But its still interesting they didnt invite BrontState at all. I would think they'd take the opportunity to help us and bring someone on as a guest.
hello
oh, sorry about the ear pain there man
Avenue Q? Or Mary Poppins?
lol
Hi Fouze
sure.
yeah, she's horrible.
Anyway
so whats going on?
lol
You're just in time for Avenue Q Musical Hour
...B..But you aren't very nice. you say very v..vindictive things...
Ponies could calm her down.
ah
/me turns to Fluttershy. "What are ya talking about?"
I love avenue Q
Cause that's what Bronies do
so just avenue q?
It's okay, Fluttershy. The Orbital Friendship Cannon will fix things. It's the only way to be sure.
like, maybe they just look at sprinkles as a friend, as opposed to a representative of bronystate
I'm probably wrong here
Yeah, you missed movie night and PMV requests
but that's just what it seems like to me
-blushes from her outburst-
well i searched the word, unlike you, and found it to mean vengeful
better crank that cannon to level 11
ok
which i am not
Is it done charging RainbowDashwins?
13Not sure Val. I'm sure they're aware and all of course.
and i have an idea of a skit to do at an anime con
/me searched it too :D
I have to wonder, I've fired that thing 5 times this week, is there a limit? ;)
what's good? what do we got going on here?
hmm
13But having someone from BronyState on as a guest would have been cool.
Next week there's going to be a Season 1 marathon before Season 2 premiere
three finger double tap yaaay go Mac.
trollestia internet is for porn
my ipod is prolly done chargin
Avenue Q
Okay, move everything that doesn't need affected by the Orbital Friendship Cannon away from the blast.
Oh....I get to see cannon fire?
They've had Sprinkles on before.
That would be cool
/me pokes Fluttershy s cutie mark, out of curiosity >.>
what's this Orbital Friendship Cannon thing?
?
With his wookie sex mic.
XD
The Orbital Friendship Cannon is always charged when there are people ready to love and tolerate the @#$% outta some bronies and pega-sis.
Get everypony to the freindout shelters!
4Yes, that's right. Sprinkles has been on the show before
poke a cutie mark?
/me moves a safe distance and sits on a cloud seat, readying his sunglasses.
Apparently their viewers loved it.
-turns and looks at Leika curiously-
I'm trying to power it up to where it affects it more.
but i would need to find people to do it with
13Have they? I dont understand why not for the mareathon then.
And requested him back or something.
YEAH PEGA-SIS alright
Oh yeah, that's another thing.
Nothing... I guess it only works with Celestia, like Luna said
07it just feels strange..
4*CRAZY THEORIST APPROACH ENGAGE*
[04:45] <NewDCD> sort of illegal if you think about it
[04:45] They could have invited us to talk or something though.
hmm
You should shoot for the Rainbow Dash costume that's going online haha
A movie of this would be badass, but I feel it doesn't need to be a movie (and that it shouldn't be)
Gah.
better hold up my phone
im already planning on crossplaying as trollestia and asking people if they like bananas
I...Is something wrong with my cutie mark?
07yes exactly
What about the 'mareathon'
yes
That's illegal technically.
:P
but never mind that
Well, I'll just go to bed.
Nope, nothing dearie
6,0I agree. . .
That would be quite hilarious
4Perhaps...Sprinkles is just a ruse sent by CircuitMane. PERHAPS Sprinkles is actually working for them, and he's a double agent.
-confused-
07and that is also true
lol
13Well, it kinda is. But I think it would have been find to have someone from BronyState on as a guest none-the-less.
Fluttershy=Confluttershy?
KILL THE DOUBLE AGENT
/me plugs in some headphones and plays some downloaded recording of a soft voice.
I was merely testing to see if you would spout out something random like Celly does
seeing as how at the con matt hill aka soarin will be there
celly?
Um...
Fluttershy...
Celestia
Oh wow, he makes awesome Flash videos
6,0O^O
13lol XD
SPRINKLEBERG!
matt hill?
Sprinkles is Sydney Bristow
What would happen if you flew as fast as Dash does when she pulls off a Sonic Rainboom?
fluttershy should wear a hat
6,0<o< SPRINKLEBERG~
13Sprinklederg...
Oh...I see...-examines her cutie mark, swishing her tail against it-
/me whispers something gently into Fluttershy's ear
that would fix at least two problems
13*berg
4How CONVENIENT that SirSprinkles isn't here right now...
/me 13does the face
oh my
if only your sis would do that with you :D
2,14 lol, nice sathi
He must be at the...
roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
Mareathon!
as opposed to yellin
TRAITOR!
Why sudden cut?
07I know right?
BURN THE HEATHEN!
07dat planning :D

-ears twitch and blushes at the whisper-
Nvm, haha, thought you were talking about Skaijo
He was the one who made Friendship is Magic Bitch
Oh, I'm told that they're likely to switch services soon.
And they might be having a merger.
2,14 this is a pretty good song
/me giggles, and nuzzles her
oh no!
07who?
oh
twitching ears!!!
in the year 2027 you get Deus Ex
what does that mean???
I wonder, does Equestria have a union?
4>mfw SirSprinkles actually IS at the "Mareathon"
07Val this album is good
2,14 I was surprised when I heard it at first, because I figured it was just a joke musical
What are we firing at again?
ONLY WITH PINKIE PIE SILLY
13Lmao
oh yeah
2,14 oh yeah, definitely
Oh, yeah I didn't specify.
XD
lol
Odysseus.
what is being fired?
/me patiently waits for Fluttershy to answer.
2,14 just I wasn't expecting a song like this in here, which was nice :P
I keep looking at facebook D:
I thought Avenue Q was just some random skit that was done at a Comic Con
A union? I'd assume there'd be, y'know, several, for different industries.
-shakes her head and looks to Roush- Y...yes?
so dari
lol
but you arent the only one
What would happen if you flew as fast as Dash does when she pulls off a Sonic Rainboom?
how many people could this merged IRC server hold?
Haya Plorf
/me 13was at the Mareathon during Rocky Horror ... >.>;
ballpark figure would b cool
Well, I was thinking, the last person to not do their job properly got SENT TO THE MOON.
you guys ever notice what happens if you say discord many times in a row?
roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
HERESY OCTAVIA
/me is still nuzzling Fluttershy
Hi there
I...I'm not sure. I've never gone that fast before. I'm not a very good flyer...
/me lunges at Octavia with his trident
I bet the weathercrafters have a union. Who else mandates the hard hats?
13<3
07Waaaaat
I'll go chekc for you DCD.
Whenever the weather factory goes on strike, though, Celestia just legislates them back to work. And by "legislate," I mean "threaten with moon banishment."
check*
07during rocky horror!
07How could you!
I could understand during True Love
13I know, Luna! I'm so sorry! :(
but Rocky Horror? that's low
hmm
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. How are all your little animal friends then?
I didn't eat today for Rocky Horror!
07Yes.. true love was... ehm...
0_)
banning a factory to a moon
13But... they talked about prizes and goodies and... and... ! I couldnt control myself. :(
Talk about a not so sunny disposition...
Do the Weather Factory ponies work with the Union?
sounds energy efficient
and low in fat
WE FOUND A WITCH! MAY WE BURN HER?
13:D
i heard a few avenue q songs on the plane ride to and from orlando
/me did not eat today because she could not. XD
/me 4grabs the stake and roke
4*rope
6,0Does she weigh more than a duck? ;3
Oh, everyone is doing very well. Everyone's gettng ready for when the cold weather comes, so it gets a little hectic around here.
now all i can think of are Twizzlers
Did you hear? The Weather Factory recently suffered a 45% drop in productivity. Apparently all the employees had their heads in the clouds.
SHE LOOKS LIKE ONE
4I say we use the floater technique
07but you got to open the door
Vhose: OHO!
so y'all ever notice how applejack has a pet dog and there are SENTIENT TALKING UPRIGHT DOGS?
Oooh. I enjoy the cold weather. Easier to warm up to the cold then cool off to the heat.
Sweater time, right Fluttershy?
/me starts licking behind Fluttersy's ears
13Lmao. ZS
13*XD
4Attach her to a giant DUMB ROCK and see if she floats
07floaters?
Hurray! Fluttershy is in the house!
ew
filthy there
07omg
LOL
4If she floats, then she's a witch
?
thatonepony: differant breeds silly
Nope, it's a full-fledged Broadway musical
13DUMB ROCK!
4If she drowns...she's not a witch
lol same thing discord
07the witch test!
6,0A ROCK!?

o-o Hiya
13>dem logical witch tests
that isnt enough
What's new with you?
umm ya you can
I got a new tablet! ^^

I like warm, tropical weather. Better for storms. Storms are incredible to watch.
07yay!
Radical! What kind?
-freezes and blushes deeply- ...Umm....I...

the book of mormon had some help from someone who helped write avenue q
We heard

As a result of the drop in productivity, many earthbound ponies were disgruntled by the poor service, citing distaste at the silly emplyees raining on their parade.

At first thinking the weather factory employees were pulling a prank, the miscommunication (and rain) was soon cleared up.

/me debats about going to bed himself
no, the excess chocolate will chip off
C-can I have taste?

I'm guessing size 11.

and it will probably have HORSEHAIR

/me noms on `BlacklightShining.
DannySwish: aren't you gonna help out?
Unless I had a Mcflurry
HAHAH I am loving the fanfare
for science?
They've discontinued to M&M ones though
13And dida backflip and landed!
/me plugs in fans FOR SCIENCE AND PROGRESS
/me yelps! and backs away from Lysiria
don't…please…
/me does a mental review of how well his birthday was.
bye everypony
/me contemplates shoving BlackLight into a vat of chocolate.. for um science.
Actually, it was reading about the fact they;ve discontinued the M&M mcflurry thats made me feel like one
bye mexican
How was your birthday, Dermathil?
07[06:40] can he join the room safely? DARI?
an Oreo and Caramel Mcflurry though
no spin
not now
4And I know how to get under dari's skin
cant over do it
(Spin: the L is always lowercase except when you're typing in all caps or saying FreezeLight)
/me was lulled by Fluttershy. "Whaah Blacklight?"
I haven't set anything to stop people from joining the room.
13You are head crab zombie!
So anyone can join.
it must harden slowly throughout
DannySwish: thatonepony is doing science
07ah ok
which lazyshy isnt helping with
Did someone say.... John Madden?
>implying anyone can ACTUALLY get under my skin
Where is fluttershy?
he wants a pegasus to help dry this chocolate
4I have before
4And it was glorious
/me gestures to his entire self, specifically to the chocolate coating.
/me crawls under Dari's skin
So what do I say when I'm pissed off? :P
I did Quite like the Odd M&M mcflurry occasionally
I'm still here.
Ew.
< is a pegasus
13wepon
I am sad that they;re gone
You guys are gross.

Twilight told me this video is about Disney Pixar Up - Married Life - Carl & Ellie by Michael Giacchino - The cut from BluRay disc
Grab my tail, mexican!
and not helping wingy
6,0:3
4That you'll quit the team
Hahaha VV.
4LOL
It's always better to get pissed off than to get pissed on.
4Dari gets so dramatic sometimes
Lawl, no, I was serious about that.
Did someone call for a pegasus? Skyflash, at your service.
4I know
4That's what makes it better
Why people moon themselves instead of just leaving, I do Not know
EXCELENT AND more words
BILLBILL
SKYFLASH!
Now I know you're trolling Ghosties.
( XD /now/ we have ponies stepping up…)
8D
Pol!
Because you are the most dramatic person I know. :P
Why go out in a boring /quit?
ohai Sol
Fly so fast, you back in time, then buy me an Oreo Mcflurry
4No, I'm being serious. I would have laughed if you left
O hai people that don't know me
ya
Why not get sent to the moon via Derpy? x:
>steal
ohai Pol
>implying I don't want you to take me away :P
Oh, Happy Birthday, Dermathil. I hope it was a good one.
fiction wings, you will hover over Blacklight and give constant slow and steady wing flaps while my fans cover the sides
Go out in style
Or an M&M one. Not fussy
SCIENCE is upon us
Okie dokie lokie!
>dramatic
OH GODS NO!
How about both?
LOOK OUT BRO
NOT SCIENCE!
I'm ALLERGIC!
>Ghosties thinks one day people are going to hunt down bronies and beat them all to death
:P
uh
Dramatic.
FOR CELESTIA!
Do ho ho.
so are ya helpin skyman?
Both sounds great
But they need caramel
quit the team?
4Dramatic, just like how Mexico or some other third world country did to emos and scene kids
Because Caramel is delicious
/me hovers over BlacklightShining.
4*sips on water*
13Dat Pony Bebop
YES!
See, now you've just proved my point.
Be back in a...flash!
Not the pony though
You so dramatic.
Pony Bebop is best pony.
AWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAA
uh
4I so realistic
ponyponypony.swf
Ponysona plox
/me rolls eyes at pun
LOLNO
not sure if getting helped
SWAG
Yes it is! Pony Bebop is the best! :D
4You can't change fact, bro
Probably not
6Luna.
You're a riot Ghosties.
Where you need me?
and strikes must be made while the chocolate is hot
all you guys'd be doing is blowing all his stuff around
4And you're in denial, dari
07Yessems?
6You have made my morning with this wonderful song/video. <3
(ponyponyponySWAGponyponyponySW—wait, WTF am I saying…)
/me nudges Fluttershy lightly, pointing to a baby bird sitting on the ground
Just a disagreement we had in Skype.
13A riot of ghosts o.o
4But I guess we're two sides of the same coin
wingaling above Blacklight
07Ohh!
oh.
07I loved doing it
School's been pretty good so far.
k, night see yas next Saturday
YES a bird
How about you? :>
4Riot of Ghosts...sounds like a band
/me snatches bird
4A really shitty one at that
And two McFlurrys, one M&M, one Oreo, extra caramel. The great thing about time travel is a pony can return the second she left!
Denial?
this may help with science
I tell you what Ghosties.
yeah me too. I like it... but I can't wait to get out.
/me tackles the baby bird. "GOTCHA!"
(this channel is rather busy…maybe we should move to #BucketOfHolding or something?)
4Ooooooh
/me celebrates!
Now who needed some wing power?
4He's gonna tell me something
skyflash, will you assist?
13Laters Sol!
YES
Absolutely.
6,0I have that whole soundtrack and love it so much. . .
Onward, to college!
above Blacklight please
Ghasts are better than ghosts anyways.
/me also grabs the mcflurries and begins eating, forking over the cash he owes
Do a test run with the bird?
and slow steady wingflap
oh nicholas cage, you so silly
/me 4waits with baited breath to hear what dari has to say
hmm, no, the bird is for later
I will bet you anything you want, an act, an possession, ANYTHING, that there won't be a day that people hunt down bronies and beat them to death.
This again? InB4BEES
ready skyflash?
You got it.
Okie what do I do know
/me 's eyes widen, nudging fluttershy a bit harder
5
then LET US BEGIN SCIENCE
6,0Luna what is this video name?
I will go out, buy a hat, and eat it if you want me to bet that.
4And I'm not saying it's going to happen, now am I?
fans ON
LETS!
SOMEPONY THINK OF THE FOALS!
4I never actually said it would
/me covers her ears with her hooves to block out Lordlyhour's shouting
/me looks to the little bird. "Oh dear...it must have fallen from it's nest..." Gets up to pick it up.
>realistic
4I said it's a possibility
07Nicolas cage losing his shit
/me turns fans on
>not going to happen
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
Alright, here we go!
nicholas cage being nicholas cage
skyflash, now you flap wings!
That's only 30 grams of fat!
lol
/me flaps with all his might!
4Realistic as in that kind of hate happened to emos and scenes
/me swoons at her kind nature
he's lossing it
lord of war is probably the only movie where he isn't batshit crazy
Well I hope you enjoy college then. :D
4I wasn't applying the word to bronies
yes, yes, i can see it working!
13And many fucks were given that day.
Lord of War was a great movie. Well, at least I thought so.
LOL Octavia
/me sets it on her back and nestles down again, eyes fluttering.
I love the Dari vs. Ghosties wars. So if you don't mind me asking, what was the disagreement about?
One losing their composure is always amusing.
/me finishes his Mcflurries
WE NEED THAT BIRD!
/me tries to stay still as the chocolate around him hardens.
/me continues falpping.
*flapping
Ghosties wanted to make it so that only 18+ people could apply for mod.
/me is exploding with giggles
/me aids the Flapping
Librarians need to do this when patrons won't stop talking.
oh. :P
THE POWER OF MAGENTA IS AT YOUR COMMAND!
/me stands behind Lordlyhour, glowering
foo.
they really ruined wickerman, what were they thinking
besides "lets make a shitty remake"
( XD )
Derpy, you should help too
so what about you then? XD
Lazy bot that you are
yes, do you geel it working Blacklight?
or existing underage mods?
Glad I haven't seen Wickerman, then.
wtf
Well I told him I'd leave if that was passed.
the original is so much better
/me flaps her wings spectacularly.
“Yeah…”
ah. I'm guessing he didn't get support from the rest of the team?
I think I'll see that one instead.
not the bees
13NOT THE BEES!
We came to a compromise, Val defused the situation.
/me is quietly laughing
One of these days, somebody's going to choose Wickerman as the A Movie.
So we never had a vote on 18+ only.
/me is flapping as hard as he can but feels the strain building up.
The B Movie will, naturally, also be Wickerman.
2,14 they already tried :P
hmm, only about 20 more seconds. . .
4Indeed, they did
4And they had to pick something else
you didn't go for it?
10 more seconds. . .
haha if I took out the 'l'
ah.

FLAP FLAP FLAP
13Awww D:

/me dozes off in his corner
/me stops
>defused
Ooh, multiple choice!
See you all, everypony. going to go to sleep.
XD
/me turns off fans
/me 13likes The newer Wickerman <3
... aww.
/me crashes to the floor
brain explosion
welp go i must
13Dat Old Spice
/me goes back to hovering.
/me lands in a pool of seat.
XD
Bye
*sweat
yes, now to chip off the chocolate
dat win
/me goes back to watching vinyl rock out
thank you kindly for assistance
This must be why Caramel wants Big Mac so badly.
you say chocolate :3
/me runs awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
lol
yea?
>yfw a stallion probably smells bad
13Haha Dari
Chocolate full of pony haior
yeah, one thing about school, it forces you back ino a regular sleeping schedule pretty much.
/me creeps up to the chocolate covered pony
wanna help?
Yay, this
:(
hey, take it easy
13Reach out and touch my *beep!*!
/me “Can I move now?” he asks. Some of the chocolate around his muzzle breaks off. “Oops…guess I shouldn't talk…”
this is at this point a careful thing
Dermathil: Ask Bjornfort, I'm sure he'll know. >_>
/me turns on a heat fan.
Yeah.
hehehe
dont wanna hurt Blacklight chipping off chocolate
makes sense
/me attacks the chocolate on the floor.
I guess...
/me joins Vinyl in rocking out
13Wut?
dont get too eager
4That's it. Black guy in Deus Ex is pissing me off
Weren't you there for that conversation Octavia?
13lol
4Time to neutralize
/me chips area around head
Count yourself lucky.
Is this synth-reinforced neoBritney?
So I don't have as mush time for my Dari-bear <3
/me brushes off excess
13I... think I missed it lol
13Awwwww XD
/me nuzzles Fluttershy, saying goodbye. He flies up and away, going to sleep.
there, now to the rest of the body
I may have missed it or forgot it too though
/me lays flat mouth agape under neath Blacklight collecting chocolate in his mouth.
13I kissed a girl and I liked it!
/me smiles and softly dozes off...
Aww, yeah it sucks, we aren't on at the same time much any more.
/me chips off fore legs and upper body
Katy Perry. <3
07did you?
07me too!
spin really now
13Maybe. >.>;
13lol
/me is surprised Val did not go crazy about that. . .
13Luna <3
:3 yes
D:
Do you guys know about the Yipyip aliens from Sesame Street? The ones that go "Yiiip yipyipyipyipyipyip"
I kissed a girl and I liked it. Then that girl kissed another girl and we all liked it.
07and I liked it!
some of that has been on the floor
danny is pervy for fluttershy
x.x
>Badass Applejack
“Um…could you not do that…”
sigh sigh sigh
6,0Oh dear. . .
When I get home from school its your bedtime already.
Sorry dude but chocolate is chocolate!
/me chips more mid body and back legs away
almost done now
6,0I dislike Katy Perry. . . .. . . . but she does have a point. . . . . o\\\\o;;; inb4 shot
:'(
And then they did more than kissing, and I recorded it. <_<
07lol lotus
/me 13shoots VV
13<3
/me is kicking things
/me chips off tail and other missed areas
13Lmao Lotus
Lesbians, lesbians everywhere
/me not complaining
13Hawt
/me wanders up, measures up the remaining chocolate
Do you guys know about the Yipyip aliens from Sesame Street? The ones that go "Yiiiiip yipyipyipyipyip"
13Haha
and
13Indeed Dari.
/me is surprised by the peice landing on his eye. "OUCH!"... Nom!
/me figured
DONE, thanks to science
/me snorts
/me 13is secretly bi
FULL OF HAIR!
13Oh shi-
XD
BeefChief: yes but we are in the middle of SCIENCE!
Also, Arbitrary object tion to SCIENCE!
ono;
/me is openly bi.
Well on the plus side.
/me is secretly secret~
Don't feel bad. :D
now, Blacklight, you will be much stronger, and have a greater appreciation for chocolate covered treats
13VV XD
/me is secretly a secret too
If you get drunk, it doesn't matter who you wake up next to in the morning.
6,0SHHHH DON'T TELL ANYPONY
:P
I have Vinyl scrathc dancing on my screen. Your arguments are INVALID!
and spin, you will get something for eating all of that chocolate as well
I only mention the Yipyip aliens because I just downloaded the official iYip app that SesameStreet put out. They make a very explicit pony reference.
13A secret wrapped in an enigma?
/me stretches out his wings, then folds them back in.
6,0Oh yeah Dari? You would know? ;D
13Indeed Dari <3
13...
>_>
/me spots a remaining peice of chocolate on Blacklight's muzzle.."chocolate?"
WOOT
…okay…
<_<
lol@Dari
O)O
/me opens his eyes and stretches, gets up for a second and starts to look out the window
13Darnit Woll Smoth!
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: YTP: The Grand Galloping Collab (http://tinyurl.com/62t5z2d)
awwww yeah1!!!
/me brushes it away.
yes, Spin, for eating the chocolate which strengthened blacklight
Sesame Street has officially embraced ponies.
you to will be affected
What was the last video? D:
Will had a small part in Six Degrees of Separation. Good movie.
too*
Ohhh what with *continues collecting chocolate from the floor*
/me licks a foreleg. “I still taste like chocolate…”
/me 13thinks of Carlton dancing to Art of The Dress
uh
13HEAD LIKE A HOLE <3
LOL
So
LOL
What was the reference?
I like the way you think Octavia.
that will wear off with a shower Blacklight
/me lifts his head high "YOU DO?!?"
13<3
so
so yeah
spin
NICE
NIN.
/me hugs Dermathil
ROCK IT VINYL
for eating the chocolate
/me glomps BlacklightShining!
/me 13loves this song
you will have
we're definately merging with ponyirc.com
yay!
a HORRIBLE STOMACHE ACHE
Don't feel bad, Dermathil. For my birthday, my parents bought me new license plates. That was the entirety of my birthday.
also, 1AM in the morning.
YES!
07awesome editing this vid + awesome song = win
/me YAAAAAY~!
seriously
you ate all that chocolate
It's not that bad Dermathil. Surely some friends around here wished you a happy birthday?
with FICTIONAL HORSE HAIR
TheLotusTeaDragon: but was your 17th birthday like that?
that isnt healthy
best video editing that i have seen for a PMV yet
Now for desert *looks at Blacklight*
/me is glad he didn't eat any
The_Creep: 10 of them on facebook, total.
Any idea when services switching/merging will take place?
GAH!
not edible
at least no more than before
Alright, everypony! Back to Cloudsdale for this pony; glad I could help with the science!
just stronger
/me pushes Spin off of him and dashes away.
You are acting like ten is a small number
No, it was my 30th birthday. For my 17th birthday, I received nothing. We were almost homeless at the time.
):
/me gallops towards BlacklightShiining.
you are credit to science flash man!
actually
and spin
4I'm sorry your birthday went so shitty, Dermathil. If you want, I could give you a royal blast off?
i was trying to get ahold of you about that
/me attempts to make fondue out of Blacklight
serioulsy take some pepto bismare or something
I want to know when it would be most convenient for you
hehehe, yeah that'd be nice Ghosties.
whatever you call it
Ghosties is terrible.
XD
13I'm sorry your Birthday was so crappy, Dermathil. :(
/me hugs Dermathil
/me 13hugs Dermathil too
and Blacklight aint chocolate!
cyall soon
I do hope you feel better, Dermathil.
/me “AAHH I'M NOT EDIBLE!” he screams, taking to the air and making for the Bucket.
4Awright
/me joins the hug
needs some rest
I'm sorry your birthday was bad .__.
13I never get anything for my Birthdays either. I've never even had one Birthday party. :(
Goodbye Dermathil. The cake was nice.
07nighty Derma
jeez, take a shower before it gets unsavory
Aw. Poor Octavia. :(
also instead of 4, we shold have about 6 or 7 servers soon
/me dashes after him YES YOU ARE!
/me grips Blacklight by his tail and begins to pulling him back. "he DOES taste like chocolate!"
Hope your dreams are awesome, Dermathil!
</overkill>
Damn.#
13Lmao
Never had a birthday part?
13<3
party*
13Nope
Wow.
/me hugs 'Tavi as well
dont worry Blacklight
AHH! LET ME GO!
13My Birthdays were always lonely affairs
/me begins chomping down on his tail.
XD
That's a shame, Octavia. Everyone deserves to be remembered on their birthday.
6,0waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitwait.
/me will cappily canibilize a pony, if they're tasty, but draws the line at licking them
I think this pony is going to bed, I'll see you fillies and gentle colts later
your strength even now is increasing
OW! Cut that /out/!
you should be able to break free
All this sadness
/me thats how RUMORS get started
6,0No. Octavia. You ARE having a party. :l
is making me sad.
13lol <3
plus that stomache ache has got to kick in like any minute
Aww. <3
/me kicks Spin, trying to make him let go.
Don't feel sad.
6,0When is your birthday?
/me stretches and heads to his house for the night
/me hugs Octavia
Wow, didn't know today was 09-10-11
/me 's chomping gets more rapid climbing his tail at faster pace.
/me pounces on Blacklight and starts chewing his leg
I've always had pretty good birthdays. :/
13I'm so shy though irl. TOTAL Fluttershy. Complete with squeek and everything.
Not anymore over here :<
Hm, how long would downtime be?
sigh
Aw. <3
D'awwww!
/me 13hugs Natleyn back <3
/me restrains Spin and Lordlyhor
/me screams in mortal agony.
Same here, 'Tavi. Only... without the squeak, pretty much.
/me eventually reaches the end of his tail.
wow
/me hugs Octavia gently, making sure not to let her squeak.
just wow
13I'm bi-winning!
Likewise on the Total Fluttershy thing.
SHould've infused his with Boiled candy
As long as we have the new servers up, there really shouldn't be.
I used to be kind of Fluttershy.
dark chocolate is nasty
But I decided fuck that.
/me 13squeeks anyway <3
That hard stuff no-one likes
I started off life as a Fluttershy. Over many years I became more like Twilight Sparkle, and then Rainbow Dash. Now I'm a mix of Dash and Pinkie.
and you are trying to get MORE of the taste?
And that I'd be outgoing and if people didn't like me, screw them.
He would've been strong AND safe from attacks fromponies
We'll just switch the DNS over for awhile.
/me smacks spin
exept elderly ones
/me hugs Octavia again
Or whatever Kabaka wants to do.
I LOVE dark chocolate
13Wewt, my Birthday is in 12 days. X3
/me smacks lordly for thinkin he knows science
/me breaks free and joins back in pursuit of BlackLight.
/me 4Octavia
Fluttershy most of the time, Dash around friends.
4LOL
6,0I was a Fluttershy until i began Music Performance. And then I became a Rainbow TwiDash thing. . .
/me continues to Gnaw on the leg
/me 4hugs Octavia
The best thing I ever learned was that no one really knows who they are, let alone what they think others should be. I became comfortable with who I was.
6WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?!?!?!
/me 13hugs Thunder_Dash too <3
dont break me
/me laughs as they continue to 'eat' decoy
/me tackles blacklight and bite down on his forehoove.
/me screams. “HE~LP~!”
6WE NEED TO HAVE A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me most certainly isn't eating a decoy
13lol Yay party! <3
I'm not so much a fan of this song, but I love how it syncs with the animation
/me wondering if they have figured out the decoy's mouth isnt even moving
I agree. There aren't enough parties in life.
13Pinkie Pie Style!
/me keeps gnawing away "good eating!"
Err, last song.
/me knows the taste of a Chocolate imbue'd ponywhen he tastes one
6I promise you, there is not a moment that day that you will forget it is your birthday.
BSoD, I laugh at you haughtily!
/me 13wonders if her Brony housemates will give her a party
13Probably not. lol
6THEY BETTER
I still can't believe you have brony housemates.
With people I don't know, I'm definitely a Fluttershy. To sort of acquaintances, Twilight, and with my friends... I'd say AJ or RD.
Blacklight your immunity to this sort of thing has almost reached completion
That's pretty cool. XD
just stay out of their sites for like one more minute
6OR I WILL FLY ACROSS A FRICKEN OCEAN TO THROW IT FOR YOU.
/me actually rigged the Decoy to explode and strapped it to Thatonepony's bacl
/me has been putting himself in a character's mind, and picking songs from my iTunes library...
13Yup, all four of us are Bronies. The rooms are even all named after characters. :P
and seriously Spin, i'd recomend seeing a doctor
So how many more years of school do you have left?
13Yay VV! <3
/me has gnaw'd off the leg
These servers are going to be replaced anyway. But might as well keep them until the payment is up.
2,14 there is so much awesome in that statement octy
(no, they're actually trying to eat me, not a decoy)
07that's awesome
/me turns around and attacks thatonepony."I need more!" MOAARR!
If I could fly to where you were, you'd have such a party
/me wanders away with it in his mouth
2,14 I...there are no more words for it...just awesome
07well my bf is a brony too :P
/me watches the decoy strapped to my decoy expload
Any time from now is fine then.
That's awesome, Octavia. I'm the only Brony in a 5 mile radius. LOL
(…wait, this is inconsistent)
huh
/me tackles Lordlyhour. "MINE!"
That's awesome, if I knew where you are I'd totally throw a surprise party for you XD
and, time
(are they trying to eat the real me or not?)
/me has no brony people near her. Her family banished her to the moon when they found out.
i was
YOU ARE INVINCIBLE (to being eaten as well)
/me kicks Spin in the nads and flies away, gnawing on the leg
2,14 you should have your roomies join us for the S1 stream and S2 premiere :P
If it's done by the end of Tuesday, I'll be happy.
;~;
/me knows how that feels
13Awww, VV. :(
damn!
/me hugs VioletVanilla
/me hugs VV
(we are)
/me 13hugs VV
they really liked your decoy
/me is secretly counting down the days until Dari has to start looking for a job
/me hugs Violet
(and I've got your leg)
/me sets his gaze back on Blacklight.
13They are going to Val lol
I haven't had any time to actually sit in front of my computer and pick songs, but already Spike has an NSync song and a Maroon 5 song in his playlist, and Pinkie Pie has picked "Move Your Feet" by Junior Senior
13Before I even knew it. :P
Hmm.
Blacklight, remember the extra decoy we made from your mold?
/me is currently hiding in the Bucket.
I don't know how anyone would react except my brother and one friend >.>
2,14 awesome
Well technically I'm not obligated to go to school any more.
…yeah?
i watched this pmv before it was cool
6So many hugs. . .
I wonder how they ignore it.
(exept I ate that one!
well, in any case, i do
oh.
/me feels loved.
07you are
Ok time for bed.
Dude. You're missing a leg
13Yayy~ <3

See you all tomorrow.
Nuu
yeah
Night, Allis
Blacklight
Night.

6Goodnight Allis~ :33
/me walks up to the bucket and chucklets to himself. "Trust me I'm a doctor."
Just, like, look down
How are we going to fund the Carribean island though?
that wasnt a leg
I'll come pick you up. :D
Hugs are awesome. I used to give them all the time.
and thats not blacklight
that is fluttershy
Lordlyhour, thatonepony: 'Tis a flesh wound.
so who cares
well... That's on down the road a little ways >_>
she didnt help with the SCIENCE
…
07night Allis

Goodnight Alliszero!
^.^
lets get some medical help
/me hugs Dari
Fuck
yes
We could have our own brony house. :D
Goodnight, Alliszero
with.... just me and you.
/me resume the consuming of Blacklight's torso.
DCD told me to put it on. XD
>_>
Hi
You really shouldn't cover ponies in chocolate
dang, how many models have i made?
Or he'd have to break some shit.
Imagine if PINKIEPIE was around
13Dat Link
It would still be a brony house though :D
None
and how many can spin eat before he passes out?
/me is loving Link~
Because, if you remember
That'd be cool.
I'll try my best
I dnoated all your false Blacklights to the staving foals
2,14 this game was so great...
Agh, Internet, Y U MAKE ME WANT TO FINISH MAJORA'S MASK SO BADLY
Fuck yeah LoZ
13lol
We're eating the real thing
/me looks up from his pony-meal "good question..why don't we test it out .. for uh.. science"
2,14 I'm hesitant to say better than OoT, but they were both so magnificent in their own way
(Equestria has starving foals?!)
no
(eeyup)
lol
z
You're hesitant?
Buck that.
Thanks.
/me finished Majora's Mask at least five times when she was thirteen.
hey
/me knows Majora's Mask is best Zelda.
OOO CARROTs!
(well, not anymorte)
if you were eating the real thing then we wouldnt be hearing Blacklight
(he got RALLY overboard with the fake construction)
also, he's impervious to your eating
Never played either of those games.
so, yeah
So can you technically get a job as a computer engineer in the UK right now?
2,14 man, I loved the game when I was little. But a year or so a go I read a plot analysis of Majoras
he shrieked in pain sevreal times
I love Majora's Mask, but I'll be damned it took a while to work out (for me at least)
now he's unconsious
So I'd have to assume they suck.
Of do you have to go to school more?
2,14 seriously...there was so much to that game
/me 4only likes Wind Waker
*Or
Yes
Simply because the graphics must be bad.
i planted a mic when he wasnt looking
/me is gnawing on a leg bone
You might like it, Dari.
and stimulated his pain for authenticity
/me understood the plot when she was young.
sorry Blacklight
well lets see
Yay~
i just foresaw this possibility
Well I could technically, but I doubt anyone would offer me the job.
MFW no reaction at all
You guys are boring. :P
/me gnaws on Blacklight's neck,"you feel anything?"
13Set us up da bomb!
still a model
you're gay prince dari
Woo!
/me is unboxing brushable Pinkie Pie
2,14 >yfw Link from Majora's mask is in Twilight Princess
dam lunna
but at this point Blacklight could let you bit him
/me 13will ungayify Dari
would have no effect
You have to go to school more then?
FF fail
speaking of which
6>mfw this reminds me of Famicom wars. <3
No fair, France is getting an Islands of Waikfu cartoon
Doesn't matter
>mi cara cuando I have no face
bow chicka wow wow
For someone to offer you a job, I mesn
*mean
you showered yet Blacklight?
He's still missing a leg
/me pokes Blacklight's still head.. "Blackliiiight?!?"
Most likely, yeah.
The need to make a new Nintendo/Famicon Wars game.
13GOT'CHA!
FRIENSHIP LASER!!!!
this is pretty intense
2 years of sixth form/college
that. is. the. MODEL.
Days of Ruin is fun and all, but nobody plays it anymore.
that's not possibly if he likes cocks
The plot didn't have me confused so much as the mechanics ("Okay, so I have these three days... What do I do with them?" "O...kay, reversing time took all my money. AND reset my side quests." "Oh, okay, I need to get masks instead... But I can't finish all the sidequests in three days!"_
ah.
(^)
Because, I ATE EVERY BLACKLIGHT LOOKING THING'S LEG!
Then probably 3-4 years at university.
and thats how equestria was made
2 years D:
13Poor flying Luna <3
Also they seriously messed up not making The Beast a playable CO.
3-4 years?
maybe the ones in this area
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
Dude was awesome.
EVERYWHERE!
in anycase
awww luna :(
/me begins eating the base of Blacklight's head slowly hollowing it out until creating a chocolate coated pony mask.
you finished the shower yet?
07:(
because the power of Magenta lets me do so
2,14 well, the plot is understandable. I was talking about the lore/mythology. Plus its connection to OoT and Twilight Princess
/me starts kicking things again
/me 13hugs Luna <3
oh, how creative spin
Yeah, that too
Well, at least I'm not doing medecine like a lot of people at my school.
7 years here.
(…okay, now this is just getting ridiculous)
/me feels loved
(yup)
yeah.
2,14 not to mention the implied fate for Link in it
(haha)
(thats the fun of it)
well if you finish your shower it will end
(I'm entertained)
13Dat walking Celestia
(so…I'm just going to put an end to it /right/ /now/)
Hello everypony.
Ohai Lyra.
/me hugs Luna
hello there
Hey fourcartridge'where do I know your name from?
Being a doctor requires a lot of college here also.
/me hugs Luna.
tinycartridfe?
FUCK YEAH
/me is amazed as the pony peices start morphing back to gether"but we ate hi..BLUUUGGHHG"
I never beat Twilight Princess, but ugh, yeah, implications...
/me hugs Luna
Its familiar. I've never spoken to you in IRC, but It sounds REALLY familiar
DakkaDakka? Pokecommunity?
13Dang, this first video is 25 minutes long...
Nuup
13YU DO DIS TO ME EQD
/me is getting chills.
/me pukes out all the chocolate coated pony emptying his gullet.
I've never seen you before.
and, there is the sickness
knew it would kick in sooner or later
How about Boo's Mansion? I used to go there.
Damn it, Nintendo, why haven't you made a new F-Zero?
(BTW, nothing after my last post will be included in the transcript)
transcript of what?
Can't say i ever did
They're silly.
/me watches unphased by his regurgitation as the pony chunks begin to take the form of Blacklight's body once again.
eh, i'll just let it bother me
(and I'm probably going to end up throwing the whole thing out anyway and just say vaguely that thatonepony dipped me in chocolate)
maybe on kongregate.
Darn it, now I'm hating Capcom again...
Or the twokinds forums
I go there
Kong
(maybe redo it later in a less BS-y way)
yeah
transcript?
(from /scratch/)
they;re really the only place I frequent, asides from here
MY BODY IS READY

Oh, I... Uhm, hi Twilight...?

I'm not dismissing it at all
6PRECIIOOOUS BOOTAY~ <3
4Best song Alestorm ever did
YES
4And hell, it's not even their song
/me 13likes precious plot... err, booty
in fact, acording to my science, the properties of this experiment may accellerate certain healing
/me growls at Spin, bucking him into a tree
I'm just discarding the transcript of this session
this is only a theorty though
>w>
Oh, this sounds like an Irish drinking song, or as I like to call it, "a song".
English ! let it be!!

4<KanyeNorthEast>: oh man, best cover ever
Play Keelhaul.

Slowly creeping closer to be quoted
MFW I misread sax
HERE WE GO AGAIN
And then Twilight was back for seconds.
13And now back to bedroom eyes Twi..
SLOWLY,SLOWLY!
When we're all wasted and beating the hell out of each other, we're all a little of both.
13Trying to seduce me again no doubt...
but it's going to have to be somewhere where I can make sure there isn't all this other stuff going on
TWILIGHT
So... Yeah, stop it Spin!
13JUST BECAUSE IT WORKED THE LAST 4 TIMES!
4There should be a Spike stare video

13Good point DragonRage
Maybe if you set up a channel specifically for this?
8again

Lordlyhour: or we could use #BucketOfHolding

Kissing is not against the bible, neither is marriage.
14back to gray
13lol
thatonepony: normally I would have copied the raw transcript, edited it, and published it as part of the Bucket Roleplay Archives
Or cuddling...
So please stop!
07,1 meows back
6inb4 everypony came~ <3
Haha. <3
AlphaOmega, epic o.o

It's all so sticky!
You mean inafter.
>w>
13Aww Synros
why do you bigots always assume we follow the bioble?
oh, uh, what are these archives?
BlacklightShining: I would be up for a more serious redo I just was unaware that we were being serious
grrrrrr.
/me pats Jadeni. o.o
MFW I wasn't even there when Hipster left.
>_>
<_<
13Allons-y!
and what is roleplay?
Yay~
thatonepony: see http://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1FuLnbzwpgg6yYu5SyMAG9En0UhtkBWlQ4ntaBfIxkt4
OMG YES!

/me huggles Lemon_Lime x///x
13Thats a bad Dari!
13lol <3
"REPENT IN THE NAME OF JESUS ALMIGHTY!!!"
That would get you a good computer science degree.
i salute you
I was either at a party or a mountain.
No
because jesus was just a guy
14well i owe it to her
6DON'T. STOP. ME. NOW!
:|
huh??
No, he wasn't.
who went around and said things
I consider this part of Blacklight's timeline, and so I'd want it archived for reference and stuff (i.e., to answer the question ‘Why does he taste like chocolate?’ if and when anypony asks later)
so, you take events that happen on chat
the 10th doctor will always be my favorite, they should get Tennant to do a voice cameo
I think this conversation needs to end right here.
13Lmao
some role-plays, yeah
He is the son of our creator and ruler.
and archive them
and you make it like a story???
OK Lets maintain the Love and Tolerance of this channel, by not bringing in Religion and Polictics .
for mlp, i mean
hmm
13Or a party on a mountain!
thatonepony: no, not a story
OH GOD
MUST DO
DO WANT
Thank you.
im not sure how to feel about htat
DFKSOPAFKASPDOGKASPOGKAESR:GLAKSDVPAOWEKfg
No
I think I'd pass out from the overload. LOL
There is no god
it sounds like a story
Seriously. This conversation needs to end o.o
13<3
just…they're published
Dammit Octavia.
Because, I was talking to SPIN, not LordlyHour.
Now I NEED to do that.
There's a reason I quote this song during one particular scene in Fall Weather Friends.
Tennant for Dr. Whooves' VA?
/me squeezes inbetween Lemon_Lime and Jadeni,facing Lemon_Lime, "This is uuh for your own ~mm good!"
6HEY, GUESS WHAT
6SOFN
make it a story for sethisto
lol
13Pinkie Pie would approve of this idea. :d
That's 'cause of the other PMV of this song.
yeah, for atleast one episode
13:D
Shut it, Lordly.
Next mountain I go to.
if you /really/ /want/, I might
You cannot control my religion.
Why?
So please stop.
I'm taking the biggest battery powered speaker I can.
You can't control my lack of religion
They'd have to resuscitate me.
At the top of the mountain, epic rave.
13Lmao
also, any chocolate tastes will be EXTREMELY faint, i can assure you
13MOUNTAIN RAVE!
so perhaps it would be best to leave mention religion out of the pony caht?
You can speak your opinion, but you can't be rude and bash my religion.
...
and this would be a funny story
You started the argument...
/me 13pictures moutain goats with glowsticks
I suggested that in the first place.
-.-
at least to me
13... wut
LOL
I love Dashie. LOL
Religion and Politics 2 topics that should be left out of pony chat. If youw ant to discuss it there are other chatrooms and even PM boxes for that
/me remains squeezed against Lemon_Lime.
I think I would explode.
Effectually, everytime anyone anywhere says anything is the one true god, they're bashing everyone else's religion
And orgasm.
If that happened.
13 /)^3
13Darnit!
ello
/me is far too easily involved in arguments about religion
though I imagine it'd be hard to explain it to him about specifically why they want him to do a va
Love and tolerance, people. Regardless of beliefs.
What dari said, haha
L.O
13My keyboard chopped Dashies other hoof oof :(
You JUST said you didn't believe in god!
AlphaOmega: ya if we're being serious leave that out of the chat I'm just teasing Lemon and Jadeni
13*off
/)^3^(\
because it implies that everypony else is wron—okay, I'm not getting into this *backs out again*
so WHY do you care?
"well you see, we've got this big fandom for our show...and they think one of the characters is you"
R.U.B.C.
13DANCE FUCKER DANCE!

Someone kill him so we can get some harmony back in this place.
/me knocked shit everywhere
#Arguing_about_religion_if_its_really_that_nessesary
I'm now a 6 sized die with a fancy casino logo.
I wonder if the singer of this song has seen this
/me rolls a dreidel. "Come on come on!... wait I'm supposed to Spin it>'
it's basically when you have a bunch of ponies acting out what characters would do
I think
maybe
/me flies away from Lordly, rolling her eyes and leaning up against Lemon_Lime
hmm
Gaaaah
why would people do that?
wait
I want my mp3 player even worse now. u.u
Role-playing refers to the changing of one's behaviour to assume a role, either unconsciously to fill a social role, or consciously to act out an adopted role. While the Oxford English Dictionary defines role-playing as "the changing of one's behaviour to fulfill a social role",[1] the term is used more loosely in four senses:
To refer to the playing of roles generally such as in a theatre, or educational setting;
To refer to taking a role of an existing character or person and acting it out with a partner taking someone else's role, often involving different genres of practice;
To refer to a wide range of games including role-playing video game, play-by-mail games and more;
To refer specifically to role-playing games.[2
who is Blacklight supposed to be???
lol
Glad to see it really Isn't that nessesary
Woah tower text drop

/me has an iPod touch
/me has a CD player
thanks for the explanation though
Awwww
that was helpfull
Okay who am I?
I have an RCA Pearl. 2 GB. At the time, it was hot stuff. Everything since then puts it to shame.
/me has...a computer...
*shrug*
Oh, Oh, I do have a cassette player, though!
13<3333
/me had an MP3 Player, but never figured out how to use it.
I.C.
I assumed an OC pony named Spin
13This video <333333
someone with a sever stomache ache
*shrug*
Okay Gotcha!
/me is... Odd
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:

/me cries
13MORE SUGAR!

Epic Pony Time?
No screw that
you are lucky
13AWESOME!
anyway, in this case, we're using it to mean definition two
I wanna be a coal Miner!
up there, in that paste
I hate Sansa. I had three of those damn things before I gave up on finding a working one.
"Time to toast these bitches"
well…
Man, it's cold here. >_<
okay, closanuff
/me is an atheist, but will gladly argue for or against any religion he's sufficiantly knowledgeable about.
mlol
13BEAUTIFUL!
'educational'
/me has a superiority complex, he thinks
doubt we mean that part
13NEXT TIME WE EAT APPLEJACKS!
…yeah, not that part
but other than that
13Beg pardon>
LOL
other than that, it fits
A few of my friends have gotten these, and aside from one guy leaving his in his pants during laundry day, they've been fine
applejack's what?
still, would make a good story, given the circumstances
So whats the scene?
must nkow
13Now that you're science...
Hm. I may have just got a set of crappy players. It happens.
13We do what we mus, because we can...
/me takes off her horse shoes, throwing them one by one at Lordlyhour as she hides behind Lemon_Lime x.x
also, the definition makes that 'twilight sparkle' costume make sense now
YEAH SPIKE
my little cosplay
What the hell was that, put my headset on to hear what sounded like the CMC cursing up a storm.
/me rolls his eyes
*nod* yeah
sry did anyone say that green was taken?
IRC is a chat
13Dat break dancin Spike
07eeyup
Imaginary horseshoes are imaginary
>assuming stuff
that would be IRL roleplay
childish ponies are childish
/me 13head bops too
So far its we got a knight(Kite) , a coal miner(me), and Blacklight(himself)
but I prefer to RP over IRC
14aghr..ok
This reminds me. I figured out one other character I could actually pull off a cosplay of.
/me head bops three
14Im cool with grey
/me 13is a raver too and loves to dance
14ish
wow, I am so angry right now its unbelievable.

XD
afk Lordlyhours are afk
I tend to flail, but for some reason comes off as dancing.
My mum came in and just stared while I was burning a hole in my floor.
That brings me up to two: The Engineer and Booster.

I'll be back in about half an hour to an hour

For non-moderating positions, we just ask them to contact us with their skill and why they think it'd help BronyState
For moderating positions, we obviously have them fill the mod form
Both methods would warrant an interview

There has to be a reason, and coming in here complaining about conspiracies isn't going to make you look good.
/me bought a cheap filter. Jupiter is yellow.
/me takes filter off.
That voice is so soft.
Who is that?
That's Fluttershy.
Fluttershy
Ah.
Clearly :P
/me sees 3 moons too :D
8Flootershoi
/me is somehow surprised that Fluttershy has an adorably soft voice like... well, Fluttershy.
/me lost $12.00 :(
D:
8hey Dari.
?
8can we play a game?
What game?
/me wishes that he could turn on his stream without the computer dieing
8well we have 20 people in chat right now
I'm sorry
how DannySwish can operate a telescope with hooves is unknown.
automagically
8lets play the ban game?
13Uhh... lets not. lol
I don't think I know how to play. XD
Remind me.
:P
8darn
8oh crap
Very well thank you
/me hides the banhammer
/me 13thinks its probably a bad idea XD
/me goes back to hiding
it goes to shuff automagically! :D
GoTo telescope
8whats the worst that could happen Octavia?
I wanted to see the rare Supernova that happened but it's out of my view :(
aww
the last one that was this bright was 25 years ago, and it wasn't as bright as this
I'll play your game >=D
8we'll just blame it on Ghostcrawler
Tell me the rules of this game.
8or Dari
13lol
8ok here are the rules
my telescope broke
Nope~
I wish I had a directional antenna and a vhf radio
/me 's shaking from the cold is jiggling da telescope 3:
one of the motors don't work anymore
I've been prepared for this since earlier. *Scrolls up*
8we make everyone a mod, then on the count of 3 we all type in a /ban and see whos left
my telescope is the reason I have this laptop...
/me 's giggling jiggles it even more X3
8it fun, no?
it was for an eyepiece camera...
That is a HORRIBLE idea.
lol
but...
I tried for HOURS to get it to work with my laptop, no success.
Hmm.
But that's what makes it fun. What was I, 98% demented?
I could go for that.
wait, I must get back to Jupiter
lol
But meh.
naw my laptop is just for the camera itself
8Grimgallop, everyone knows there is only on true banhammer
not for controlling the telescope... the camera is USB, so it's like super easy to use
But unfortunately only if EVERYONE was here and no one AFK.
8and its in Molestia's bedroom
Becuause otherwise they might not know what's going on.
o.o
And they've just been banned for no reason.
So.
Synros, why wouldn't you use kicks instead?
8but thats the fun of it Dari
I /should/ take pictures of what I see, but it's too small to really come out nicely
Meh
8..uhm bans are more fun Silvermane
8ok well it was worth a shot
8:(
Oh, I saw some deep sky object at Chabot Observatory, but forget what it was
/me 8goes into hiding
If you want to go and make new channel for it that's fine.
/me wants to see SUPERNOVA
/me 13really hopes Synros was kidding and pickin for fun 3<3
But I can't condone it with AFK people here.
BLUEBLOOD

/me just hit his nose on the eyepiece. ow.

I've also seen some double stars, like Mizar
8lol no Octavia, Ive been a mod for only 2 hours..I am dead cereal.
Oh, I forgot, I saw Venus once

13lol Yeah...
It was unimpressive heh
Brb
I got it as it passed behind a house
it was orange and setting
okay, I see three moons jutting out from Jupiter. One is close, and the other two are a bit farther out. Who can guess what moons I'm seeing?
13Also "guis, I'm super cereal!"
I'm a member of the AAVSO, and joined just before my telescope's tracking motor blew out... a few days before I finally figure out how to work it... I got to track R Leonis for a few days

Ah, nevermind.

Four parts in one update?
Jesus, these fanfic writers.
Io, Europa, and Ganymede
You could always just kick all the idle people first. :p
I love that PMV.
Likewise.

8I wrote a fanfic once,
errr
heh
yeah, that's right
Callisot, Europa, and Ganymede
8never got around to posting it to EQD
I wrote two fanfics, then struggled and failed to write anymore.
But watabout Calliso?
I think it's actually Callisto closest to Jupiter...
I don't know if it's Ganymede Or Callisto
Right now I'm writing a painfully OOC AU TF2 crossover.
I only see 3
Io's behind Jupiter
No, Callisto I think is farthest
Let's write a fanfic in the chat right now.
:P
Io's behind Jupiter? are you sure?
8sounds interesting
me gusta
8don;t let Dari start
>_>
<_<
yeah, but since it's orbit is circular, it can appear closer to Jupiter than the others at times, remember.
Then I'm certainly seeing Europa, Ganymede and Callisto
let him start it :3
8ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
Bound to be shipping if Silvermane is still around.
8ha
Once, out of luck, the first time I ever saw Jupiter, three moons were perfectly aligned with each other and Jupiter, going out to the right
It was really cool
...
8ok fine Dari starts

Mostly I'm following the Pony+class setup CancerousCinema had for his videos, except I decided to go with Gilda as The Demoman instead of Zecora.

I think flash just crashed.

Okay, so, I have two lenses. One is excellent quality, but is 26mm (aka makes the image too far away) and the other is crap and is 9mm (makes it bigger)
DO YOU SEE MY DILEMMA?
you need one in the middle
/me iz moneeless
da corporate evils eated it

8its quiet...to quiet. Dari is plotting something
I ordered a pack online one time that got me a 12.5mm and that was decent, as well as a 2x barlow
it also had a 32mm I think
So...
Dark clouds swirled overhead as Dash leant over the limp cold body a purple pony. Twilight had been trying to fight /them/ off, but they were too strong and numerous - the purple pony had given her life so that her friends might live another day on this earth. There was no stopping them though, all of Equestria would fall.
I was stupid. I had an opportunity to buy a whole fricken kit for the price of one good one alone. And it included that good one. And I didn't buy it.
Dash looked up at the sky and screamed:
8wat ever happened to the fanfic in IRC?

KASDPFGLAS{PGALGP{FADFLGH

Someone tell me.
(the pants were dead? WHY?)
due to a really high temperature of over 112 degrees, which it is definitely not...
Go to instantrimshot.com. I use that one all the time.

That was hardly instant.
So.
That was practically delayed!

Anyone gunna tell me who the Equestrians stopped the pants?
Now when Fluttershy tells a corny joke all you need to do is switch tabs :D
Or at least describe their last stand.

not really, it still looks fuzzy, but maybe that's becase that's as clear as it can get
hmm
I don't /remember/ seeing a difference with my glasses on...
Did't take some one long to use that shot of Applebloom
Yeah, i guess it doesn't matter
I like to take my glasses off when I look into the eyepiece, but that's just me.
It'd better that way, imo

what about getting contacts?
/me tests the compensation theory with his left eye, which is worse
4:08 AM~
yupp, thats how it works, I can fix it to my eye
okay
but that means what is focused for me isn't focused for others -_-
Hurray! I helped!
Was that fade slider you are the video Dari?
Pats for Patrick!
reset it when you're done?
O_o?
lol
and others don't realize it can be better when they're not into astronomy
…sort of…

AAH! ITS GONE AGAIN oh wait, another cloud.

did you make all the sound go left to right channel and back or was that part of the video.

The potato IS A LIE.
OH
Portal 2 reference.
o-o Flutterbro explained that to me today actually.
Next asdf please.
Roses are often used as a sign of love, but they wither within days. It's almost like saying, "I love you for your looks, but once you grow old you're worthless to me."
aand the chat...dies.
aand the chat…dies.
Potatos, on the other hand, don't wither. Even if you leave them in the bag, they'll sprout and keep growing!
agh, stupid Colloquy!
This is why you don't pick the bloody things.
You keep them in a garden so they don't die so quickly.
>I wanna be a pie.
>I stole your face
And, unlike, roses, they aren't just for appearances. They can be enjoyed in *countless* ways. They can be boiled, baked, fried, cut into chips... a potato is like saying, "I love you in a thousand undying ways."

i think i did see that movie
dun dun duuuun

Although, Dil didn't have much in the way of speaking aside from baby noises and shouting "Tommy!" or "Poopy!"
i know
Synros: just curious. xP I think I am on my way to possibly becoming mod myself
/me is dozing off
6Grrrrrr... Who's being mean to my Synros?
Whoa, what? Tara Strong is Dil? D:
6*bark*
Yes
mind = blown
/me licks Fluttershy on the cheek. "Very distracting indeed..."
8no wants to play my games :(
Well, that
Means I get to give myself a pat on the back. First mind blown in chat.
/me shivers, squeaking and blushing. "Ah... S-Silvermane... others are watching though..." >>
6*revs up banhammer* Oh, they'll play... they'll play...
8i mean are people that timid of the banhammer?
XD
6AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
well tara did tons of shows
Oh, yeah, big time.
6*takes out camera*
6Do continue, Silvermane...
I would say get a room but this is a room so, *gets some popcorn*
Bubbles from PPG, Raven from Teen Titans, Timmy Turner from Fairly Oddparents...she's got a long list.
/me blushes, trying to glare at SirSprinkles but can only manage a slightly annoyed look. "Y-you..."
I think Cosmo is cute.
/me looks about the gathered audience. "Hmmm... they /did/ ask for it..." He proceeds to glomp Fluttershy, pinning her to the ground. "Your move, sweetheart."
>> wait, isn't this room PG-13? Oh dear... )
not this late(or early?) it isn't.
/me gasps, looking up at Silvermane with wide eyes. "But... we're already doing so much in the other rooms...! S-should we really do this /here/...? What will the children think...?!"
All the best stuff comes on after 3am.
We just spent two days watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I think everyone is still recovering.
Cosmo was probably one of my favorite characters on that show.
6It is always PG-13... sorta...
6>>
6<<
ok now i just feel creapy
hey SirSprinkles
6Yes, anon?
Too bad they did that stupid live action movie
can you give Synros, I cannot log back in becuase appererntly Im still in chat\
/me looked down at Fluttershy. "Children? Frankly, if children are on here a 6am, it's their parents fault. Besides, it's /your/ move. I hold no decision for the moment..."
kick*
thx
6...gonna chang nicks back or not?
/me blushes more deeply, but blushes more deeply, her wings starting to unfurl. "O-oh no... my wings...!"
oops )
I never saw it. Was it completed or is it still in production?
I hate... errors )
It was completed
ugh. Also tired )
wingboner!
/me yawns
You get teh friggin point )
and the live action actor for Cosmo was nowhere as cute as the cartoon
Can't sleep
D&D game in less than four hours
finally gawd\
stupid internetz
cosmo?
Well, I'm glad I didn't see it.
/me looked about, surprised. "Oh dear, it seems the TaRDiS is upset..." as a faint glow overtook him.
Cosmo is Timmy's Fairy godfather in "Fairly Oddparents"
When Arkham City comes out. I expect -alot- of Harley Quinn voice overs for Twilight.
8MY POWER HAS RETURNED!!
Why's that?
yay?
/me 8grabs the banhammer, and smiles.
8u
8sup
Tara Strong's voicing Harley Quinn
dun even think about it...
I thought half ops couldn't ban?
8nah I would never
>D&D
wait we're on the Tardis? huh...? =-=
6They're not allowed to.
8lol I can't thats wats so funny
8harhar
That's incorrect, Efreet. She's voice by her original actress, Arleen Sorkin
/me squeaked, looking up. "What in the how did we...?"
8i stop noaw
It's one of their big selling points
Dungeons and Dragons?
wat? Really?
Yes
They've changed?
Her, Kevin Conroy (Batman), and Mark Hamil (Joker), are all original Batman TAS voice actors
I'm going back to bed, night
8so, I'm thinking of a number between 1-100
And it was Arleen Sorking in Arkham Asylum as well
42
78
Baww. I was looking forward to it.
It's 42
I just double-checked on imdb
/me looked around. "Oh, i traveled around with the Doctor a few times, and the old girl took a shining to me. She gets jealous at times..."
8nope
There are not enough batman ponies
*Sorkin
well this is easy.
6Is it...
8agaian
1
2
3
4
etc...
3.14159
XD
I mean, I've seen bats, robin, Harley and, I think, the joker
8dude
lawl SirSprinkles
good one sprinkles.
8duuuude
but no-other baddiers outside of that
6COME AT ME BRO
square root of 2
no scarecrow, no penguin
1.41
8you you mother....
is it i ?
8NO!!
8the number is PAIN!
No Bane, no crocodile dude
:P
6There's something on your face!
*Killer Croc
Can I pick e as a number?
8nononono
And yeah, I know what you mean
Hell, not even Man-bat
i isn't between 1 and 100.
IT WAS PAIN!
Mad-Hatter is another good one.
SirSprinkles, ILU <3
lawl.
6XD
Though I think Colt-bat would be horrifying
8hands in his mod badge.
/me pursed her lips. "I am /so/ confused..."
I really liked the mad hatter
IT WAS PAIN
lawl
e^(pi * i) + 1 = 0
I HAVE seen a riddler pony
solve.
6>implying I don't haze new mods for like, a week or son
6*so
there was something on your face....
/me flips the channles, how did it get on boxing, I was watching shipping.
I think a Two-Face one might exist
8i can kick :(
8should i?
..Idunno WHY, but batman's villians are my favourite league of evil type bunch
8hmmmm
6You can't kick me. XD
kick who?
-growls- >>
Most of the other villians in DC sorta Grandstand
you can't kick him.
8lame
The joker? just kills 'em
8wait ok, where FLuttershy?
>_>
/me (is messing around trying to get all these command-line-install apps to work)
toplessrobot.com is great chaek out their fan fiction fridays
/me stood up, wings full of pomf. "Don't worry about it, she'll learn to deal. And now we are in /private/, aren't we..." He chuckled lightly
dis is da way you left me, I'm not pretendin' no hope no love no glory no happy endin'~
YES!
I DID IT!
IT WORKS!
[awesome face here]
Well, the Joker 'just kills' everyone EXCEPT Batman. He wants Batman's death to be special.
I mean sure, he does do the evil death traps, but, relly, killing his enemies'd really just be a perk
all it took was one symbolic link…
Lol
all he wants to do is duck with people's minds
/me jumps though as she looks around, and floating above them is says 'BBC'.
This Cake.. It is so delcious
Woot!
Delicious, even.
ACCIDENTAL SELF CENSOARAGE!
i was wondering where that static was coming from and why it felt like i was on skype
8lol i cannoit even remember the command for kick, so u lucky FS
Lol
6Oo
8<---is worst mod evar
and HE is a mod?
prolly something like /kick username
/kick name?
6How hard is it to remember /kick is to kick?
Synros: /kick?
it's slashquit
alt f4 perhaps
I must admit though
lol
now I can install these four things I wanted but couldn't install before
lulz
I love DC comics
Turn it off and on again.
Nah, alt+F4 is a system command, not an IRC command.
hm, looks like I deleted them
oh maaaaaan
8wb Turgle.... :3
I want to see Tara Strong slip more Raven into her Twilight. She slips into Timmy Turner a lot, but I want some more of that laid back Raven-y snark.
6You have to delete system32 to kick people.
:D
format c:
I love the snarky!Twilight moments
Turgle, now you're just being mean.
lawwl.
Is it plugged in?
you know what would be awesome.... ashleigh ball working some rainbow dash or applejack into their hey ocean performance
Theres too much Fanfics with Twilight screwing up, magic out of controlling
so hao DO you kick?
and not enough of her, cool, calm, collected just breezing through everyone else's fuckups
OC your cpu to 4.8 ghz. That's the only way to kick like the masters.
you have to horribly damage your computer for it to really shine
I agree, Lordly
after it catches on fire of course
8ok no more use and abuse
don't you mean duckups.
^
8Ive had meh fun
hardy har har
what's the COMMAND to kick?
And, Iks, I can't really comment on that. I don't actually listen to hey ocean.
Twilight is a badass. Sure, she's a bit of a nerd, sure she's socially inept
but she is fricken awesome
I'm curious if I can kick myself for some reason
and you can go to hell efreet
8no I tried
8see
Twilight is my favourite Mane Six Unicorn <3
wtf
;-;
:)
Agreed, Lordly. Also agreed, Efreet.
dang
Twilight is Best Pony
darnity dang diggity
Indeed!
Derpy is my favourite pony
but Twilight is the best
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNAAAHHH....
Now, we just need to get her into a cloak and dub some Azarath Metrion Zinthos over her.
8SS is probably plotting my demise
/me kicks... it missed
slash gquit?
:P
heh
i didn;t get that joke
Teen Titans
well neither do i but it would be funny... you know like bands always yelling to the crowds to cheer like "i cant hear you!" *crowd cheers louder* and she then just yells in rainbow dash voice LOUDEEER!
6I can kick myself.
my accuracy isn't high enough to be a mod yet.. but one day
that would be so awesome
6You have to be at least mod to kick yourself from the chat.
8i can't Ive tried several times
That would actually be pretty cool.
8oh
6>OP
6I mean...
that would cause every brony in the audience to simultaneously...
Twilight, Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy, Mane 6 ponies, for species. Vinyl, Octavia and Derpy for Background.
6HOP can't.
8wheres the fun in that
Except if she did that...
and my scentance just goes to EaD material
She'd get a bunch of ~yays
I think I'm going to get some sleep~
8night Grim
and then half of the crowd goes yay~
6It's a thing a lot of servers have set up to prevent new mods from kicking other new mods.
yeah
8hope you don't hate meh
~You rock. Woohoo.
8(he totally hates me)
ROR
/me is swallowed by a vortex of dark mist, vanishing into nothingness. As the mist clears, screams seem to echo from all around, though they don't seem to originate from any specific point.
I have yet to see a fanfic that portrays either an Evil/insane Twilight or a Tyrant celestia in a way I'd find believeable
8^ why would he kill himself?
^:Lordlyhour
Twilight has the most raw power available to her than THE LIVING GODDESS has ever seen.
8shouldn't play with pure antimatter
(Oh, but I'll be back, and perhaps all shall be explained...)
If you actually enjoy the Doctor Whooves fanfics, I find the method done in "The Traveler" is pretty believable. Mostly because it is the vast amounts of Time Lord knowledge that taint Twilight's mind.
GrimGallop goodnight mebbe I will take you up on your horrible D and D pick up line sometimes
The secret of creating an evil char is to add some form of tenderness or kindness to them
If Twilight went insane, she could erase a good portion of equestria off the mao
sometime*
i was caught up in some mist once.. i turned into a seru /feelsbadman
it helps as a counterpoint, but also makes them more believable
oh great hidden screamer ending in a pony game. Cute.
But it is also more enjoyable, since future!Twi and present!Twi are separate characters, and present!Twi is firmly set against becoming the Evil Empress her future self turned out as.
8and so the Meteor strikes again.
Hrrm
do you know what Fluttershy sings in the shower?
Theres this one Drwhooves Fanfic i was really liking, but I can;t re-find
Which one is that?
8wait
the last chapter I read up to ended with something along thelines of "why would a DENTIST have an hourglass for a cutiemark"
and thats all I realy remember about it
8./kick Fluttershy (reason pending)
death metal?
cause he lets the patience wait long?
Yes
Colgate is a girl, dude
hard core?
Huh? Well, can't say that helps me, really.
she sings... DISNEY SONGS
she *
/me waits for the joke
-dies-
how do you sing hard core?
Sorry.
i thought we are talking about whoof
Fluttershy :|
8that was just terrible
I know.
hehe
I was talking about a DR whooves fic
:D
Colgate is also a Timeord, apparantly
8now I cannot do anything about it
darn it I cant bring my self to brick the cute.
Colgate is more likely to be a dentist than Dr. Whooves…
you take an apple.. eat the stuff you're supposed to.. then make a song about the rest
Everypony is a Timelord!
in b4: Fluttershy singing i will go the distance
…Colgate being a brand of toothpaste…
that's how to sing hard core
i know
A popukar fanon concept is that Colgate is the Time Lady Romana
HAHAHHAHAHA
MY GOD! IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW!
A companion from Classic Doctor Who
You stomp your wholeself in
you stomp your--
WAIT
i has an idea
mebbe
I should stream
well then SHEEEE has a cutie mark as a dentist because SHEEE lets her patience wait.... like doctors always do
e-e
I'd love to see an evil Twilight Fic.
8s......
i approve
but when its your turn you are in there for 2 minutes
8ima go eat a muffin
I think we would have to find a way to dislodge Dari.
they should make those who would take long to wait long too
Wherein Twilight went completely bonkers. Quite some time before the whole "move to ponyville" thing
I would direct you to the Traveler, but I think the author might have abandoned the fic.
how?
A real shame, cuz I thought it was great.
8i know how
and everything was just a delusion
8we all send him suggestive photos of ourselves.
8no...?
8ok...:(
/me tackles Fluttershy, nibbling on her ear... as he realized she didn't have pink hair... ooops
All her freinds are just corpses she's playing with, animating the whole town by magic
oopsie, who did I just get frisky with?
not it
we take his house from him that's how
Celestia is all withered and, Bound and stuff. Just, nearly dead
8a little help SirSprinkles
(see: house next to his name AKA lodge)
huh...?
That's...a bit too grimdark for me
Why have I no pink?
I think I know a way but i was going to bed and if I started streaming I would have to stay up.
The whole NMM thing was, indeed the Return of Luna, but she actually came back fairly normal, and had to be beaten up by twilight
(because it wasn't you, Fluttershy)
/me 8makes Fluttershy pink, and stuff.
the reason we don;t see her agian the rest of the series is she;s off gathering help
dislodge = take that lodge next to his name away
The Grand Galloping Gala and all the Lead up? Twilight Made a Move on Canterlot
8doesn't Dari live in a castle?
Lodge generally refers to a compact dwelling intended for infrequent stays, as for hunting, etc.
how am I not me...? eh?
almost sounds like he's going for a qwertyui face.
so ya normally he probvably does
Parasprites? Made to try to destroy Twilight's zombie minions
8ah..I'm so terrible tonight..i'm just going to sit over there.
probably*
Phweet!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOoZ9doAiW8&feature=feedu
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Game Fails: GTA IV &quot;Worst thing done to an NPC... ever&quot;
THIS CRACK IDEA? IT HAS REACHED HIGH ENOUGH CRACK LEVELS TO APPEAR O MY BLOG!
IDENTITY CRISIS
/me throws pink hair dye at Fluttershy
/me wispers to Fluttershy, he glomped some random pony thinking it was you but it wasn't cause you went to go get a muffin.
oh my god..
that video..
My crotch hurts now.
/me fluttershy
e frunk guy is back
2nd comment = I lol'd
b man answe me dammit
/me waves to Donraj.
Sympathetic Pain overload
/me waves back
oooh... i just thought of something.. testing for science!
/me Fluttershy
-is now a science experiment-
/me x Fluttershy
there whoops
he blinded me with science!
SILVERMANE
ISSUE
STAT
I know you from #EquestriaDaily, yes?
MeteorVenture thinks to claim a MeteorVenture x Fluttershy ship!!
i can has fanfic?
Heh
Yeah, thought lately I haven't been active there.
Thought so
Same
WHAT
OH TEH NOES DON'T BE FOALISH
Mostly because of the ridiculous convos
I go! to the grocery store
I KNOW WHO I AM NAO....
I hang out in EAD now. x3
I AM...
Oh look we are shipping overnight again.
FLUTTERRAGE!!
its a game character....
Is it me, or is Super Filly Adventure getting popularity because of the "bad ending", as opposed to the other parts of the game?
I never really got into that chat
Yeah I recognize you. That's why I waved.
I just lurked and occassionally made comments
!!!
/me hands Flutterrage a bunny.
Bad ending?
Bad ending, yep
wait.. i just got rejected by fluttershy.. she was even too afraid to say she couldn't go up a mountain to see a dragon.. FOREVER ALONE
/me hides in the woods, muttering about unnauthorized shipping in his bronystate...
Your comments must have been clever if I remember your username.
What's the bad-ending like? I only got the good ending. Lol
I only played one ending
The Super Filly ending
-kicks MeteorVenture with a karate chop- HEEEYAH
You should play it for yourself to find out
Fine then. I SHALL!
/me tip hat
/me storms off
challenge accepted
The game was alright, but I don't like endings where you have to actively attempt to do things counter-productively to get an alternate ending.
is what you say in this kind of situations
/me deflected it with his fist
1) Talk to everyone, up until they start repeating themselves (make sure you talk with Pinkie before handing over all invintations), this includes pets 2) Bake a good muffin and give it to Derpy, 3) Play the game between 11PM and 5AM (just cheat and set your computer's clock)
And then, just go back to Zecora
LE GASP
and then you DIE!
oh my!
/me flies into the wall with a epic CRASH, causing a crater! Then with a groan she falls to the ground, a large lump rising on her head. Flutterrage is gone... and in her place is Fluttercry!
Does she gobble you up, in a big tasty brew?
Nope
Oki night all. Have fun storming the castle and such.
...damn
i would feel bad but *takes off Fluttershy's mask* i learned that you were actually big mac a while ago
bye Sumica !
That'd have been cooler, I think
for super obvious reasons
/me rushes to the rescue, curling around Fluttercry in a protective shell of fur and feathers.
....The hell?
MeteorVenture don't ruin my epic rp!
/me is immediately set into tears as she forces her self up, eyes wide and sad. "H-how could you...?"
8want me to take care of him Fluttershy?
*the mask never came off*
but you really do die?
/me is stunned by the request! "N-No... you... you don't need to." She says in her quiet, demure and trembling voice.
See for yourself
NO!
You can watch it on YouTube if you don't want to play it
I like hot tamale!
Well, I try
is it really that popular?
/me is trying to load it. Internet is -really- slow.
/me 8goes back to the fetal position in his corner...crying.
thats actually the reason I haven't played it yet
How many endings ARE there?
The game itself isn't that special. Just that the bad ending is... Well, yeah
how bad?
Apparently three, and one of them is just the super filly with Derpy being in the party or so
/me continues to fill her audience full of d'aaaaaw for she is so adorably cute and the words so admirably descriptive that everyone is caught in the whir of emotional tension that is causes!
scary bad?
*starts crying* i don't know what else to do.. i think i'm trying to summon nerdy friends
wtf bad?
just plain BAD bad?
caused* )
Donraj: I hear D&D is p fun actually
It is
That depends entirely on you
I've never done it though :c
...eh
I think I'll pass
I grew up reading D&D sourcebooks
Never played it until a few years ago
*nerdy friends arrive* stuff just got real
/me rushes to the rescue, curling around Fluttercry in a protective shell of fur and feathers.
chat slowed /way/ down
Thanks to me
SOO! anyone wanna check out my blog? I promise it will be sexy
me: nerds! help me out here! nerds: we'll think of something
as in awesome, sexy
not sexy sexy
/me is taken by surprise by Silvermane's gallant and very well timed arrival! (Even though he posted before ah well) Fluttercry stares up at her guardian with wide eyes. "Silvermane...!"
*intelligence rises*
whats it about
Sexy sexy belongs elsewhere. I.e. in a scentance not refering to a blog reffereing to me
Basically, I take input
[03:51] Lordlyhour: SOO! anyone wanna check out my blog? I promise it will be awesome
assuming you mean that ^ sure
and then, using my disease lump of a brain,explain that with a Crack theory
YEs
That is exactly what I mean
Dammit, I cnt manage a mootone on IRCs
http://thelordlyhour.tumblr.com/
LEVEL UP
PK FIRE! *uses PK Fire*
Because monotones are great when talking about something. they make it soundlike you mean the opposite of what you're saying you;ve just learned what you are saying by rote
Currently, I have no input
hence no more output than I;ve gotten in here in the lst few days
BONG! Reflected by Star Fox's handy-dandy reflector!
Hmmm...I am dissatisfied. Well, not dissatisfied, per se, but more or less sad.
*hits it with bat*
On a Cross an Arrow is complete...and yet I want more of it to read
Me too..
indeed
Perhaps I can hold out hope for a sequel.
/me forgets his line, so he stands there holding Fluttershy
There'll be a second story, I think
K-RACK POW! Oh teh noes what will happen nao?!
Oh yeah, I gotta read the latest chapter
I want to see the Stallion versions in the Mare's Ponyville. ALong with their CMC.
Because it ended both plothook and kind of weak
MASTER HAND APPEARS!
I want the CMCs to meet each other
Oh god
...CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS, LOVE TRIANGLE! YAY!
Love star of david?
Double the CMC, double the fun.
Then swoops down and grabs the LITTLE PONIES below [aka Silvermane and Fluttershy] easily, pinching them like bugs.
Could someone pass up the fimfiction link?

Because 3 of the mane 6 fell in love with themselves
(oh my)
Mason's link was more convienant
HE WINS
.....
/me goes off and cries
/me shakes his hooves triumphantly in the air.
^_^
though already, two of them WERE in love with themselves
*uses taunt* < v ^ > (< dance dance arrows)
i'm not sure where Fluts self love comes from
what I wanna see
I think that the author chose the perfect pairings in that regard.
is the two realms dragged together
*taunt over* alright chums up! lets do this
DANCE FAWKERS DANCE! )
so, there are two of everypony
Oh god. Two Derpys
Mason, what? Shipping everypony with themselves except go for Aj x RD?
*dances again*
No, they've already met
where do you think Dinky came from
I mean, sheeh
the competition has been narrowed! Only three players remain! [For it seems the majority of them have probably retired to sleep for the night and will be in for quite a surprise when they look at the logs!]
Though, Twilight wasn't that as much
Flut's self-love stems from the fact tht nopony she has ever known has loved the things she has loved as much as she does. Since Butterscotch is her opposite, he DOES share that love, which essentially makes him her perfect stallion.
