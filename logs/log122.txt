Yes, you can, Thunder_Dash.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM8muC_uWUk
bufurd, then let me rephrase, there's tons of good hip-hop out there,
Also the Jenova boss theme from FF7 is absolutely amazing.
Why thank you :P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVA2z_zbWwA

I'm not scarred, I just hate it because everypony thinks it's fucking canon
I would watch it
fluttershining!
:o
Higu Pinkie, no thanks
Now Pinkie scares me
11> Ponies
but the author makes it in a way that she is incredibly condescent to her character
11HOLY FUCK THAT WOULD BE EPIC!
I'd rather see Fluttershining?
each time I hear this song I think of an extremely awesome tribute vid I once saw
11Rainbow Dash!
Something Broke: The Continuing Tale Of Pinkie Pie and Ponycide by george desroches
>I just realised we watched 2 videos in a row with the same song
noo Dash!
Don't do it!
RUN RAINBOW< ITS A TAP
6Probably.
I KNEW IT!
The Fluttershining.
6Not here atm.
Thats one movie I dont want to see..
there's nothing you can do about it.
overused due to the fact that it was awesome and made by clint mansell?

/me saves Luna

No such thing as overkill
Celestia blew herself up then?
The problem is when people treat it as canon
:P
What's it titled?
:P
Celestia fixes everything
05mfw immortal=invinsible
Luna kills a few. Celestia murders everyone.

meh, really not interested in all the electronica.
I read that she intended not
OH WAIT HE DID
Sea Ponies, oh dear
this is good background music, not foreground
Faust intended for them to be in S1.
Sea ponies are ponies in the ocean.... that's about it. They're like sea horses.
Only Flutterponies and unicorns (flutterponies being the butterfly wing ones)
But there wasn't time/resources or something.
I lways thought Flutterponies were the Ten Million Fluttershies across Equestria
Faust said there'd be no sea ponies in S"
S2*
Faust isn't here for S3 remember ^_^
Then the mod just lied to me
Season 3 is in the balance.
OH YES

The moon is pretty outside.
Why are the trains pulled by Ponies?!
What's the point of the locomotive in the front then
>implying the Moon isn't always beautiful

…And trains are bad for kids?!
just roll with it
ight guys
you have to keep up the image in their minds, to a kid a train withought an engine would look like nothing
We do
THE MAJORITY OF THE VIEWERS

well that was more done to make the story make more sense
... I don't >:
6I shall return, it is time for a smoke...
WHY?!
their priority is the primary audience
IE not us.
there is no machinery in equestria
^
:\
It would have made just as much sense, if not more, if the train would work the way it was supposed to!
Applejack has a truck.
07again?
there is a fuel crisis in equestria
/me hugs Luna
That's not magic >_<
yeah Luna
i do it weekly.
As it says in my comment and in the group.
right?
BUT THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THE PONIES PULL THE TRAIN
not really
not really complex machinery
Only ponies make that song likable to me
Osnap, Under Pressure!
It's called suspension of disbelief. If anything, it was done to keep the atmosphere of Ponytechnology in place
Queen!
equestria is riddled with inconsistencies, for instance pinkie states that she eats hot dogs after saying she is vegitarian
could be a log burning stove
No need to bust a nut

SAFARI IS FO BAWSES
this client doesn't let me cycle channels
wat do
13lol
Lets all just band together and rag on the idiots still using IE
Yeah, now imagine me trying to tell my subjects at work that they shouldn't use IE
NO

I like FF7 because it doesn't use as much resources and starts up faster
IE people are begging to get viruses
let's just hate on all the Opera users
What's this song called? :0
Yes
OHWAIT WHERE ARE THEY?
Hate on IE
opera is actually very underrated
07live and learn
lol
13Then get luvs!
opera is the hipsters' browser.
Opera is nice.
....I probably should've been able to guess that, huh, Luna?
I feel like we just watched a Season 1 Marathon after watching all these videos -___-
07:)
IE: Only good for downloading other browsers.
One reason IE Security is flawed is that its integrated into the OS
lol
/me is using chromium
lolllzzz, i uze safari XDD
no
I don't like the interface of Chrome(ium)
AND THIS BIKE IS A PIPE BOMB
agreed

Inspect Element is the best browser-thing ever

I surf the web with my mind.

cold play is easily the second most boring band I've ever come across, they're not even bad in a fun way.
You just don't like ballads
13lol Bufurd ;)
bufurd MY OPINIONS. LET ME SHOW YOU THEM.
Me?
13Bonus if you get the reference.
Aaw.
/me grabs #bronystates shoulders
OPINIONS
OPINIONS EVERYWHERE
13Haha
13>internet
cool
who's poking me?
6It doesn't? Oo
6It's usually not client specific... =/
Though I prefer to stick to C-family languages.
Yep...
I prefer .... anything
still, Coldplay's bad, but nowhere near as bad as Coldplay
o.o
I pretty much prefer C++ since its the only language I know
the prodigy
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwI3cIcFEcU
more epic music videos, enough to tie the world together
this one is epic
it's /cycle #bronystate no?
but seriously, if I can give coldplay anything, at least they're not Nickelback
Nah, doesn't work out
13Yes
30 years now?
My Little MythBusters
pony mythbusters?
Man I remember when it was still 20 years!

jmIRC (mobile IRC client)
Hate it.
WE'RE PONIES ON THE MOON
GO WATCH SOM ALREADY
here's the note I sent to madmax
WE CARRY OUR HARMONIES!
13Ahhh, shoot. I've never used the mobile version of mIRC before. But I would certainly think it would let you cycle the channel.
*continues listening to invaders must die*
07is there a mirc for ipad too?
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
http://miburl.com/Ps5FYA
07ponies on the moon

13So may be a while before we hear from her.
haven't gotten a reply, hopefully she decides to enter the channel (and becomes a regular...)
but ponies :(
no rush
7:34 PM?! PONY TIME!
that said
13But the message looks good. Though you didnt mention anything about possible background ponies thrown in if she has the time. :P But oh well. Other than that, it looks good to me.
we have a lot of regulars now, ja?
alright
3:34 AM? pony time!
13We're at 51 atm, not too shabby.
that way you can pitch the idea
It's like my mind was built for mathematics and programming... aka logic.
7:35 PM?! PONY TIME!
07I like this song
13If she has the time to join us here, that would be awesome.
>is a very good idea I go to sleep now
if I wrote it into the note, it'd sound too...abrasive
My Aspergers also help a great deal.
/me asks Luna, "who doesn't?"
3:34 AM?!? Where do you live? On MARS!!???
/me shrugs
oh yeah
guys?
13Yeah, I can see that.
it's day like this that I'm thankful I've been staying at least a day ahead on my NaPoWriMo fic, because I've only managed about 1000 words today
because the stream has distracted me

Is this the special prize, Luna? :P
magic bridge is magic
Not a bell! My only weakness!
???

Bells weaken goats, its magic it needs no explanation!
RAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHH

Why didn't I take that bell down?
lolololol
Why did Splooge come out?
lol "hathers gonna hate"
haters*
WTF?
As long its not 3.5 then I dont give a dam
Is this shit?
Hail.
3.6 is worse than 3.5
Make baseball-sized hail!
G4>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Everything Else>G3.5>G3.6
>mfw I thought my headphones were fucked up instead of the vid
It has very little sound on the right channel, but there is SOME :P
proto-PMVs?
seriously....
can we go back to g4
Herospirit speaks truth. Effective
This song is FANTASTIC, but not a good version
G4 > ----------- Everything else--------->a spiders web--- >G3.5 and all other generations
G1 was pretty awesome
It wasn't G4, but it had Tirac
ot that
in
teres
ted
in
any
thi
ut
F
i
G2 had no games.
er, shows
Putting on some Lovin' Spoonful instead, because they were awesome :P
;_;
is she rideing pinkie pie?
I hate how Colloquy glitches on me
G2 toys never got a show, then G3 hit
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFlXzGH2vA
MY CHILDHOOD
Pinkie was originally going to have wings
She'd like to be Applejack, though.
Applejack is awesome.
But she was a farm girl.... hmmmm
wait
If you believe in magic, come along with me...
why is it G3.5, G3.6 and nopony is talking about G3?
idk anything about non FiM
Wow
weee!
DELICIOUS
SHOOBEDOO SHOOB SHOBEDOO CLIP
dang, cant find 3.6
G3 was crap, but not quite as much crap
Gen 3 was eh I guess
Seamen ponies.
River is a sea?
LAWL
SHOO BE DOO
lmao
Hence the song Silly Pony
This song isn't that bad
they're both like "what the fuck is going on"
07so guys is'nt this awesome?
It is!
It really is kind of surreal looking at G4 ponies compared to their G3 (or in AJ's case, G1) incarnations
These two have no fucking idea what's going on.
/me dances with Luna
some things are best left in the past luna.
You can see it in their faces.
07and there's more to come
07*trollface*
...
luna... no. no luna.
Yeah, I didn't quite watch this as a kid
Just WAT
THESE ARE NOT THE PONIES I WANT
IT BURNS
07actually
07this is a special playlist :)
07my personal request
6,0Just for us! :3
:<
laughing out loud?
i might just leave
07oh yes
a G1 playlist?
No, lose our lunch!
i have CS:s to play
C'mon, this isn't too bad actually. Not GOOD, but far from excruciating.
/me *mutes*
I need something to justify not doing my homework!
G4 RD is G1 Firefly's brain in G3 RD's body
/me plays timewarp
RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE
Da fuck is dat
hobo
RAINBOW DASH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SPEED, SHE LOVES FASHION!
timewarp makes this at the very least twice as bearable
G1 Supports Hobos
little hobo?
Firefly's mind
LAWL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7u3nhANa4
paradice estate?
why isn't he rapping instead?
That hobo is a walking plague.
I want the hobos around my house to go away >:
CAPITAL IDEA!
A punk zebra?
... that Zebra.
6,0Instead of falling asleep and staying asleep, I woke up again. . .
zecoras ancestor
is that
6,0And suddenly had some tune in my head. . .
Thundurus I believe?
Tornadus
A song about eating shadows.
Tasty…tasty shadows
A zebra pimp?
I don't see any shadows...
SUDDENLY DUTCH ANGLES
lolno, Bufurd, though it would fit with this :P
Seriously, coherence wasn't very important in the 80s was it
Now the left channel is messed up
now it's only out of the right channel?
Wait
PONYLAND?
...
not ONLY right channel, just... mostly
Rainbow light.
...this song's tune reminds me of Saddam Hussein's song in the South Park movie
Ponyland is located near Manehatten
Those villain songs
all I could do during that was think "I CAN CHANGE!"
or banished them to the Earth
A rainbow of light!
A Rainbow of Light!
RAINBOW OF LIGHT? LIKE THERE'S ANY OTHER?
/me is still listening to the timewarp
A little piece of rainbow? ew.
is there a rainbow made of antimatter?
/me is listening to Something Broke
is this a dwarf?
Bufurd: That song is scary
SEX WITH PONIES
PUT IT ON
NAO
Sex with Ponies?! WHAAAAA--
It is a dwarf...no relations to my name...*gulp*
Yes, it's awesome.
It's still scary as all fuck
the only song that has ever made me cry
>Sex with Ponies.
lolwut?
13lol
40mil before season 2 anyone?
*spams eqd*
its FLUTTERGNOME
we'll see if we can time it to happen RIGHT AT the S2 premiere
Oh no

As we didn't know they were doing an event.
and go the f* to sleep, how can you handle it lol
Later Sephirdd
bye bye :D
I sware it's like cox knows I want to see next Saturdays schedule and are refusing to update it.
hmm
/me hugs everypony
Some ponies just try and put war in everything.
13I would think they would have invited us perhaps those as guests at least or something, y'know?
Night.
Dat...
Whatever that noise was.
Bloop
Dee: ya but not ponies slly
8silly
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps mexican|afk
*silly
I know bad things happen but...
13"onus" Nada.
<.< Ponies are Differnt, they resolve issues with kindness
not stupid fluttershy stupid comment stupid stupid
Onus - the responsibility
Or duty or something
inb4 sluts
13New term to me.
13But still. Not even an invite.
Well, it's really based on the alternate character interpretation of Celestia. Some think she's a cruel tyrant.
spin i dont need a hatchet
It's pronounced owe-nus.
why would you type lightly annoyed?
Bushido?
07what's going on?
I'm back baby
w
lol don't ask me, I'm completely lost :P
B..because it's how I feel.
ITS FOR FLUTTERHSY!!
then why would you bring it to me?
kinda pointless
you want to hurt fluttershy???
WUZ UP!!!!!!
Dang that bloop
hi dee
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
-shies away behind Spin-
Hmm…I should really go grab some nourishment for my hunger...
Either way, thanks for the feedback foalks!
>mfw I had no idea dari even had a different nick
13I'm just kinda surprised we didn't even get an invite for someone from here to be a special gurst for the mareathon. Especially considering the "affiliates" thing. Kinda like a slap if you ask me.
it just...looked right
But then again, I should also be working...
:P
>_> do it
13lol
dis song
lol
Return of Harmony I think
it is 'shys'
Still have Materials HW, Thermodynamics HW, and an Organic Chemistry Quiz all next week :/
why?
Its shies
lol, this song is da bomb
hmm
Really?
2,14 lol
Yeah, it's definitely "shies" when in reference to a pony.
I seee
But I don't live in Manehatten
i dont insult anyone
fictional or otherwise
And yet...
Its not Fluttershy's fault just this kid is being quite annoying
07Well.. how do we get a banner on the frontpage?
well, Octavia's point still stands (as I understand it) why weren't we invited?
you'd think they'd at least mention it to us
we probably can't
is*
But >$100 a ticket is quite pricey...
we're an episode stream
07we are far more then that...
sort of illegal if you think about it
how?
hi hi
Great
Through meaningful dialogue?
They could have invited us to talk or something though.
cool
EqD would probably NOT want to put our banner at the front page
nice pony ^
brb
U SILLY
>MFW they put up news items on us which has us on the front page
What's the difference?
i try to be nice to all
13They may be. But its still interesting they didnt invite BrontState at all. I would think they'd take the opportunity to help us and bring someone on as a guest.
hello
oh, sorry about the ear pain there man
lol
Hi Fouze
sure.
yeah, she's horrible.
Anyway
lol
...B..But you aren't very nice. you say very v..vindictive things...
/me turns to Fluttershy. "What are ya talking about?"
I'm probably wrong here
-blushes from her outburst-
well i searched the word, unlike you, and found it to mean vengeful
ok
which i am not
Is it done charging RainbowDashwins?
13Not sure Val. I'm sure they're aware and all of course.
and i have an idea of a skit to do at an anime con
/me searched it too :D
hmm
Next week there's going to be a Season 1 marathon before Season 2 premiere
my ipod is prolly done chargin
That would be cool
?
XD
Get everypony to the freindout shelters!
Apparently their viewers loved it.
-turns and looks at Leika curiously-
I'm trying to power it up to where it affects it more.
but i would need to find people to do it with
13Have they? I dont understand why not for the mareathon then.
And requested him back or something.
YEAH PEGA-SIS alright
Oh yeah, that's another thing.
Nothing... I guess it only works with Celestia, like Luna said
07it just feels strange..
4*CRAZY THEORIST APPROACH ENGAGE*
[04:45] <NewDCD> sort of illegal if you think about it
[04:45] They could have invited us to talk or something though.
hmm
You should shoot for the Rainbow Dash costume that's going online haha
Gah.
07yes exactly
yes
That's illegal technically.
:P
but never mind that
6,0I agree. . .
That would be quite hilarious
-confused-
lol
Fluttershy=Confluttershy?
celly?
Um...
Fluttershy...
Celestia
6,0O^O
13lol XD
SPRINKLEBERG!
fluttershy should wear a hat
6,0<o< SPRINKLEBERG~
13Sprinklederg...
/me whispers something gently into Fluttershy's ear
that would fix at least two problems
13*berg
/me 13does the face
oh my
2,14 lol, nice sathi
He must be at the...
roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
Mareathon!
as opposed to yellin
TRAITOR!
Why sudden cut?
07I know right?
BURN THE HEATHEN!
07dat planning :D
/me grabs his trident
2,14 lol
http://www.spreadshirt.com/hate-detected-firing-orbital-friendshi-C3376A7856394/color/2
Nvm, haha, thought you were talking about Skaijo
Oh, I'm told that they're likely to switch services soon.
And they might be having a merger.
2,14 this is a pretty good song
/me giggles, and nuzzles her
oh no!
07who?
oh
twitching ears!!!
in the year 2027 you get Deus Ex
07Val this album is good
2,14 I was surprised when I heard it at first, because I figured it was just a joke musical
ONLY WITH PINKIE PIE SILLY
13Lmao
oh yeah
2,14 oh yeah, definitely
Oh, yeah I didn't specify.
XD
lol
Odysseus.
/me patiently waits for Fluttershy to answer.
2,14 just I wasn't expecting a song like this in here, which was nice :P
A union? I'd assume there'd be, y'know, several, for different industries.
-shakes her head and looks to Roush- Y...yes?
lol
but you arent the only one
how many people could this merged IRC server hold?
Haya Plorf
Well, I was thinking, the last person to not do their job properly got SENT TO THE MOON.
roushguy: you would power the flux capacitor and travel to the year 2015
/me is still nuzzling Fluttershy
Hi there
I...I'm not sure. I've never gone that fast before. I'm not a very good flyer...
13<3
07Waaaaat
Whenever the weather factory goes on strike, though, Celestia just legislates them back to work. And by "legislate," I mean "threaten with moon banishment."
check*
07How could you!
hmm
0_)
banning a factory to a moon
13But... they talked about prizes and goodies and... and... ! I couldnt control myself. :(
Do the Weather Factory ponies work with the Union?
WE FOUND A WITCH! MAY WE BURN HER?
13:D
/me did not eat today because she could not. XD
/me 4grabs the stake and roke
4*rope
now all i can think of are Twizzlers
Did you hear? The Weather Factory recently suffered a 45% drop in productivity. Apparently all the employees had their heads in the clouds.
SHE LOOKS LIKE ONE
4I say we use the floater technique
Vhose: OHO!
Oooh. I enjoy the cold weather. Easier to warm up to the cold then cool off to the heat.
Sweater time, right Fluttershy?
/me starts licking behind Fluttersy's ears
13Lmao. ZS
13*XD
07floaters?
Hurray! Fluttershy is in the house!
ew
filthy there
07omg
LOL
4If she floats, then she's a witch
?
4If she drowns...she's not a witch
you cant write it off to breeds
13>dem logical witch tests
that isnt enough
umm ya you can
not really
07yay!
-freezes and blushes deeply- ...Umm....I...
ya really
We heard
nu uh

At first thinking the weather factory employees were pulling a prank, the miscommunication (and rain) was soon cleared up.

/me tilts her head at him, blinking curiously.
D:
Blacklight, do you feel any different?
6,0OOOONE MOOOORRRREEE THIIIIING!!!
Hats give him indigestion though
because now that I know it's for the reaction, I might subconsciously do something that I normally wouldn't do when dipped in chocolate
hmmmm
do I feel different?
yes, yes, go on
Uh Oh, got disconnected
continue that train of thought
well, yeah, chocolate isn't exactly as light as the surrounding air…

Just a disagreement we had in Skype.
13A riot of ghosts o.o
4But I guess we're two sides of the same coin
wingaling above Blacklight
07Ohh!
oh.
07I loved doing it
k, night see yas next Saturday
How about you? :>
4Riot of Ghosts...sounds like a band
4A really shitty one at that
yeah me too. I like it... but I can't wait to get out.
(this channel is rather busy…maybe we should move to #BucketOfHolding or something?)
4Ooooooh
/me celebrates!
4He's gonna tell me something
YES
Absolutely.
Onward, to college!
above Blacklight please
/me also grabs the mcflurries and begins eating, forking over the cash he owes
and slow steady wingflap
This again? InB4BEES

You got it.
/me 's eyes widen, nudging fluttershy a bit harder

4And I'm not saying it's going to happen, now am I?

LETS!
4I never actually said it would
>realistic
4I said it's a possibility
07Nicolas cage losing his shit
/me turns fans on
>not going to happen
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
Alright, here we go!
skyflash, now you flap wings!
lol
/me flaps with all his might!
4Realistic as in that kind of hate happened to emos and scenes
/me swoons at her kind nature
he's lossing it
lord of war is probably the only movie where he isn't batshit crazy
Well I hope you enjoy college then. :D
yes, yes, i can see it working!
13And many fucks were given that day.
/me sets it on her back and nestles down again, eyes fluttering.
One losing their composure is always amusing.
/me finishes his Mcflurries
/me tries to stay still as the chocolate around him hardens.
/me continues falpping.
*flapping
/me is exploding with giggles
/me aids the Flapping
Librarians need to do this when patrons won't stop talking.
oh. :P
/me stands behind Lordlyhour, glowering
foo.
besides "lets make a shitty remake"
( XD )
Derpy, you should help too
yes, do you geel it working Blacklight?
or existing underage mods?
Glad I haven't seen Wickerman, then.
wtf
Well I told him I'd leave if that was passed.
/me flaps her wings spectacularly.
“Yeah…”
I think I'll see that one instead.
not the bees
13NOT THE BEES!
We came to a compromise, Val defused the situation.
/me is quietly laughing
/me is flapping as hard as he can but feels the strain building up.
2,14 they already tried :P
hmm, only about 20 more seconds. . .

I may have missed it or forgot it too though
/me lays flat mouth agape under neath Blacklight collecting chocolate in his mouth.
13I kissed a girl and I liked it!
/me smiles and softly dozes off...
Aww, yeah it sucks, we aren't on at the same time much any more.

Never played either of those games.
he shrieked in pain sevreal times
now he's unconsious
Of do you have to go to school more?
*Or
Yes
Simply because the graphics must be bad.
/me is gnawing on a leg bone
You might like it, Dari.
and stimulated his pain for authenticity
/me understood the plot when she was young.
sorry Blacklight
well lets see
Yay~
i just foresaw this possibility
Well I could technically, but I doubt anyone would offer me the job.
MFW no reaction at all
You guys are boring. :P
/me gnaws on Blacklight's neck,"you feel anything?"
13Set us up da bomb!

Woo!

You have to go to school more then?

No fair, France is getting an Islands of Waikfu cartoon

Role-playing refers to the changing of one's behaviour to assume a role, either unconsciously to fill a social role, or consciously to act out an adopted role. While the Oxford English Dictionary defines role-playing as "the changing of one's behaviour to fulfill a social role",[1] the term is used more loosely in four senses:
To refer to the playing of roles generally such as in a theatre, or educational setting;
To refer to taking a role of an existing character or person and acting it out with a partner taking someone else's role, often involving different genres of practice;
To refer specifically to role-playing games.[2
lol
Glad to see it really Isn't that nessesary

it was for an eyepiece camera...
That is a HORRIBLE idea.

I could go for that.
wait, I must get back to Jupiter

But unfortunately only if EVERYONE was here and no one AFK.

Callisot, Europa, and Ganymede
8never got around to posting it to EQD

But watabout Calliso?
I think it's actually Callisto closest to Jupiter...
I don't know if it's Ganymede Or Callisto
I only see 3
Io's behind Jupiter
No, Callisto I think is farthest
:P
Io's behind Jupiter? are you sure?
8sounds interesting
me gusta
8don;t let Dari start
>_>
<_<
yeah, but since it's orbit is circular, it can appear closer to Jupiter than the others at times, remember.
Then I'm certainly seeing Europa, Ganymede and Callisto
let him start it :3

/me looked down at Fluttershy. "Children? Frankly, if children are on here a 6am, it's their parents fault. Besides, it's /your/ move. I hold no decision for the moment..."
kick*
thx
6...gonna chang nicks back or not?
/me blushes more deeply, but blushes more deeply, her wings starting to unfurl. "O-oh no... my wings...!"
oops )
I never saw it. Was it completed or is it still in production?
I hate... errors )
It was completed
/me yawns
and the live action actor for Cosmo was nowhere as cute as the cartoon
Can't sleep
finally gawd\
stupid internetz
cosmo?
Well, I'm glad I didn't see it.
/me looked about, surprised. "Oh dear, it seems the TaRDiS is upset..." as a faint glow overtook him.
Cosmo is Timmy's Fairy godfather in "Fairly Oddparents"
8MY POWER HAS RETURNED!!

Mad-Hatter is another good one.

Though I think Colt-bat would be horrifying
8hands in his mod badge.
/me pursed her lips. "I am /so/ confused..."
I really liked the mad hatter
IT WAS PAIN
lawl
e^(pi * i) + 1 = 0

8wait ok, where FLuttershy?
>_>
/me (is messing around trying to get all these command-line-install apps to work)
/me stood up, wings full of pomf. "Don't worry about it, she'll learn to deal. And now we are in /private/, aren't we..." He chuckled lightly
YES!
I DID IT!
IT WORKS!
[awesome face here]
all it took was one symbolic link…
Lol
/me jumps though as she looks around, and floating above them is says 'BBC'.
Woot!
Delicious, even.
ACCIDENTAL SELF CENSOARAGE!
i was wondering where that static was coming from and why it felt like i was on skype
Lol
6Oo
8<---is worst mod evar

/kick name?
6How hard is it to remember /kick is to kick?
Synros: /kick?
it's slashquit
alt f4 perhaps
I must admit though
lol
now I can install these four things I wanted but couldn't install before
Turn it off and on again.
hm, looks like I deleted them
oh maaaaaan
I want to see Tara Strong slip more Raven into her Twilight. She slips into Timmy Turner a lot, but I want some more of that laid back Raven-y snark.
6You have to delete system32 to kick people.
:D
lawwl.
Is it plugged in?
Theres too much Fanfics with Twilight screwing up, magic out of controlling
I agree, Lordly
8ok no more use and abuse
don't you mean duckups.
^
8Ive had meh fun
hardy har har
And, Iks, I can't really comment on that. I don't actually listen to hey ocean.
but she is fricken awesome
I'm curious if I can kick myself for some reason
8no I tried
8see
Twilight is my favourite Mane Six Unicorn <3
wtf
;-;
:)
Agreed, Lordly. Also agreed, Efreet.
dang
Twilight is Best Pony
darnity dang diggity
Derpy is my favourite pony
but Twilight is the best
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNAAAHHH....
8SS is probably plotting my demise
/me kicks... it missed
slash gquit?
:P
heh
i didn;t get that joke
Teen Titans
6I can kick myself.
my accuracy isn't high enough to be a mod yet.. but one day
8i can't Ive tried several times
That would actually be pretty cool.
8oh
6>OP
6I mean...
6HOP can't.
8wheres the fun in that
Except if she did that...
and my scentance just goes to EaD material
She'd get a bunch of ~yays
I think I'm going to get some sleep~
and then half of the crowd goes yay~
yeah
8hope you don't hate meh
8(he totally hates me)
ROR
I have yet to see a fanfic that portrays either an Evil/insane Twilight or a Tyrant celestia in a way I'd find believeable
^:Lordlyhour
Twilight has the most raw power available to her than THE LIVING GODDESS has ever seen.
8shouldn't play with pure antimatter
(Oh, but I'll be back, and perhaps all shall be explained...)
sometime*
it helps as a counterpoint, but also makes them more believable
But it is also more enjoyable, since future!Twi and present!Twi are separate characters, and present!Twi is firmly set against becoming the Evil Empress her future self turned out as.
Hrrm
Which one is that?
8wait
the last chapter I read up to ended with something along thelines of "why would a DENTIST have an hourglass for a cutiemark"
and thats all I realy remember about it
8./kick Fluttershy (reason pending)
cause he lets the patience wait long?
Yes
Huh? Well, can't say that helps me, really.
she *
/me waits for the joke
-dies-
Sorry.
i thought we are talking about whoof
8that was just terrible
I know.
hehe
:D
8now I cannot do anything about it
darn it I cant bring my self to brick the cute.
Everypony is a Timelord!
i know
HAHAHHAHAHA
you stomp your--
WAIT
i has an idea
mebbe
I should stream
e-e
8s......
i approve
I think we would have to find a way to dislodge Dari.
Wherein Twilight went completely bonkers. Quite some time before the whole "move to ponyville" thing
I would direct you to the Traveler, but I think the author might have abandoned the fic.
how?
A real shame, cuz I thought it was great.
8i know how
and everything was just a delusion
8we all send him suggestive photos of ourselves.
8no...?
8ok...:(
All her freinds are just corpses she's playing with, animating the whole town by magic
not it
we take his house from him that's how
(see: house next to his name AKA lodge)
huh...?
(because it wasn't you, Fluttershy)
the reason we don;t see her agian the rest of the series is she;s off gathering help
dislodge = take that lodge next to his name away
8doesn't Dari live in a castle?
Lodge generally refers to a compact dwelling intended for infrequent stays, as for hunting, etc.
how am I not me...? eh?
probably*
Phweet!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOoZ9doAiW8&feature=feedu
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
THIS CRACK IDEA? IT HAS REACHED HIGH ENOUGH CRACK LEVELS TO APPEAR O MY BLOG!

I hang out in EAD now. x3
I AM...
Oh look we are shipping overnight again.
Yeah I recognize you. That's why I waved.
I just lurked and occassionally made comments

-kicks MeteorVenture with a karate chop- HEEEYAH
You should play it for yourself to find out
Fine then. I SHALL!
/me tip hat
/me storms off
challenge accepted
/me deflected it with his fist
LE GASP
and then you DIE!
oh my!
Oki night all. Have fun storming the castle and such.
...damn
That'd have been cooler, I think
MeteorVenture don't ruin my epic rp!
/me is immediately set into tears as she forces her self up, eyes wide and sad. "H-how could you...?"
8want me to take care of him Fluttershy?
*the mask never came off*
but you really do die?
/me is stunned by the request! "N-No... you... you don't need to." She says in her quiet, demure and trembling voice.
See for yourself
NO!
I like hot tamale!
Well, I try
is it really that popular?
/me 8goes back to the fetal position in his corner...crying.
thats actually the reason I haven't played it yet
How many endings ARE there?
how bad?
scary bad?
wtf bad?
just plain BAD bad?
caused* )
Donraj: I hear D&D is p fun actually
It is
That depends entirely on you
...eh
I grew up reading D&D sourcebooks
Never played it until a few years ago
Thanks to me
me: nerds! help me out here! nerds: we'll think of something
*intelligence rises*
whats it about
Basically, I take input
assuming you mean that ^ sure
and then, using my disease lump of a brain,explain that with a Crack theory
YEs
Dammit, I cnt manage a mootone on IRCs
http://thelordlyhour.tumblr.com/
LEVEL UP
Currently, I have no input
BONG! Reflected by Star Fox's handy-dandy reflector!
Hmmm...I am dissatisfied. Well, not dissatisfied, per se, but more or less sad.
*hits it with bat*
On a Cross an Arrow is complete...and yet I want more of it to read
Me too..
Perhaps I can hold out hope for a sequel.
There'll be a second story, I think
Oh yeah, I gotta read the latest chapter
Because it ended both plothook and kind of weak
MASTER HAND APPEARS!
Then swoops down and grabs the LITTLE PONIES below [aka Silvermane and Fluttershy] easily, pinching them like bugs.
...Why did you immediately think to ship them?
XD
