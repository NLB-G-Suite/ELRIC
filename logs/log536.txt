SolairePony89: i loved the incredibles
He gona fight them off!!
Om: I've got a few theories. ;)
I don't want to be an addict again !
Drugs? O_O
Cid is sick. Give him a good fish to save him or a bad fish to let him die. You can't leave him bedridden.
Suicide O:
because Final fantasy games have so much to do with each other .....
say no to drugs
And then he shoots himself.
NO DRUGS WEED IS NOT A DRUG
Black dude dies first.
Drugs are bad, m'kay?
he's gonna stay behind and fight off the aliens isn't he
Tremors with Kevin Bacon and giants sonic hearing worms! you will love it CoalDust
Cole Train! :(
hell only need one bullet

Incredibles was pretty neat. Haven't watched it in a while, though. I'd have to go downstairs and fetch the DVD, you know.

toy story is the best pixar movie
Nyst, sadly :(

I love how only one character in the whole movie got animated hair. the rest, deal iwth your buzz cuts and hair buns
Dark92Enigma: none, its a standalone
I would not trust him alone with a gun.
Silverscreen: nice
why do they continue to act like guns make any sort of difference here
inb4 death

X2 is a fairy tale, to scare little childs
13if injured guy says "give me a gun, i'm letting you guys go on", you just do it
Kammerjunk: me too, and I still do
It's like a Michael Bay movie: the black guy dies
@Sumica: Just Like Sonic O6'.
/me and SolairePony89 create a giant crater from there massive brohoof
Oh come on Sumica, X2 had cool dresses :D and I'm a colt!

They were rendering this with Pentium 3 933s. You're lucky to have that one character with hair.

Drop yer weapons! You are surrounded by armed bastards!

So Vince Offer survives, but they killed the black dude? Sucks.
Never go alone, because you might get killed by aliens.
Since the movie hasn't bothered to characterize its cast much, this is a good opportunity for them to kill them all off
SODA!

how do you do Emotes?
AskDerpyDoo: I go there all the time.
This isn't Final Fantasy movie. It was made by Square's film division and directed by the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise but it's clearly using the name to sell itself and considering the gamble they took on making it, I don't blame them.
he's got a very squeaky voice.
fly itself. no genre awareness
SaxyPretender the one who killd him ?
operatorPony: Most of the people on Ponibooru migrated to Derpibooru.

Someone should summarize what references on games this movie made... it would be quite a mass of Survival/Horror.
I am quite literally stunned that not-vasquez is still alive

This movie is playing out EXACTLY like Metroid Prime.
A phantom Spirit...?
Even in this movie's logic.

Worst part... Bad guy dead too soon to see himself proven wrong! :)

EVERYTHING IS SAFE FOR THE NEXT ! GILLION YEARS the end
at least old man is still alive.
OH MY GOD ITS PINKIE PIES LAUGH
these are the voyages of the starship Enterprise
hi DSNesmith
lol
The world looked perfectly fine in the overview
DOn't tell me it reaches all the way to the ghost's planet. That would just be stupid
so the earth is a cosmic onion?
And the evil red things turned into good blue things, the end.
12I keep putting a in the wrong spot
dat lifestream
03I COULDN'T find a panoramic mode like the Sony's have
then they died.
Why does Sid wear tube skirts?
some cameras have 2 lenses for 3d pix & vids
Doctor it's alive :O
Sumica: Intense planet secks

THIS IS TOTALLY SONIC REFERENCE!!!

so it was ALL FOR NAUGHT
What about AKI?
Look, a pillar of lue shit
See, Cid is so badass, he survives *Cid dies* oh.....
you just missed the most fantastically final final fantasy ever
its mission, to seek out new planets and cultures

Next time, fuck Gaia, call Asura and he'll sort this whiny planet out... with his FIST.
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FINAL FANTASY?

The Force is strong with this one...

03also, the only 3D cameras I've seen are horrible
and now the old man and the girl have to buck to repopulate :D
There's more than one barrier city on the planet
That's how Luna created the stars.
03like 640x480 LOL

Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut had a better ending than this

If only we would have listened to Captain Planet.............:'(

I found a plot MORE menial than a Final Fantasy game
Narolas: sorry about that. I crossed the line there.
There are other cirties, you know.
otakon: What, a fourth colour?
There are presumably other cities still alive
The boobs will save him
It's warm

Fuck him while you still can
Not the last two humans, there's a lot of other barrier cities left !

CCCP: Oh good, you just missed the filn.

THE END? :D
:O
0,14Eagle?
Kandarihu: It's fine, i'm sorry too, i just tend to rant about dissapointing movies. I have nothing against the religious lore in a movie, but not when it's making such a bad job at telling a weak message :p

StinkomanFan: He died for their sins.
Narolas: I don't think it's even trying to send a message.
oh come on

RX-78-SweetieBot: but that's the thing, if they did this the first time it wouldn't have been horrible
NOW TO THE MLP EPISODE!
Fast Forward through it :O

Hai everypony. :3

Not as bad as I would've thought.

12but my dads' trying to amke me use both hands >.<
4/10. It just didn't hold my interest. The music was VERY mediocre given Square's track record. I already shared my thoughts on the main thematic issues, and the villain sucked.
Meanwhile: this was BEFORE the whole 'WORST ENDINGS EVER' bit
Alien ghosts/10

I have never seen such spread out ratings

Can I spam a wall of ponies now?
Meanwhile: the rest of teh game was damn enjoyable
5/10 I like what they did with the grafics for the time it was made but storywise a big mess.....
CAN'T WAIT FOR TREMORS! THAT MOVIE IS FUNNY!
god, they explained nothing, had little fantasy, and based most of it off FF7 yet ignores all the others

12oh god
Gaia is a pretty cool idea. A giant soul recycler that manages the balance of life on a planet.
But the soundtrack gets an 8 for this song alone

for reference, there is now an entire skype call now gay for that jacket

Its a bit weak in the end. i would probably watch it again. but for me its about average
07not so much
6/10. I hate this film. But love it at the same time.
there's really long japanese names on screen. That must mean this was a cinematic masterpiece. *slow clop* :'(
okay*
03exactly.
2/10
if it had ponies, I give it a 7
otakon: Yeah but EA sticks scalpels into the urethra of it's customers. Blizz is better than that.
Kandarihu: Exactly, it's not sending anything at all except "there's mife beyond death" and something related to the earth :p
5/10
yeah, that's ALL of the voice actors
...hi.
Time to grab some high-octane suds!

Hello Spell-of-Gaming
wasnt the best movie i have seen but it was still really good
0,14Dark92Enigma, calm down.
HUG MACHINE !
otakon: yes, it would be horrible, just not as horrible. The fact that the star child exists still leaves the endings to be terrible, not to mention that each one is LUL SPACE MAGIC.
12it wasn't THAT slow
Meanwhile: except for the whole D3 is always online
Meh

1,11Idea was cool, but the characters were flat, the plot was boring and predictable, the "moral" was hard to decipher, and the overal execution was poor at best.
Gaia applied on a universal scale is amazing idea

G'night everypony
PONIES PONIES PONIES!
10/10.1
twilight_sprinkle: I was expecting a audio adventure. I was pretty pissed after I first watched this.
Okay. If there is a message, it's that being gung-ho and trying to destroy something that seems to have overrun the world is never a good thing.
Hiiyo CCCP!
Ponies time?
Everyone else's RAEGRATINGS: 0.5/10 would not care again
This ending sucked.
Kandarihu: It just ... doesn't really do anything, this movie :(
PONIES TIME?

what Silverscreen said
*Hugs back* Yay.
6/10 i cant give more........
/me hugs GilDash
Silverscreen: There was a moral?
Kandarihu: and guns are usless
otakon: If you're willing to complain about that you're just a pansy.
Silverscreen: I still don't get the point.
hi SolairePony89! C:

It wasn't The Room terrible, but I wouldn't watch it outside of this stream.

Sad :'(

RX-78-SweetieBot: dude, it's been said that any sufficently advanced tech looks like magic to those who can't comprehend it

Like years later, I don't get it.

too many predictable cliches IMO
/me hugs pikorar
it was a decent movie on its own but a terrible piece of fiction compared to final fantasy
Universe Gaia
hello
Just a question
SPACE MAGIC
It touched me... innapropriatly
I give it a 7/10.
The moral is that ghosts are...bad?
Oh that's right ! PONY TIME
ANYONE WHO GIVES IT MORE THAN A 2/10 HAS NEVER SEEN A MOVIE BEFORE!

What happens to everything now?
Nyeeeee
/me hugs Phoenix_5707

This definitely wasn't a GOOD movie, it was just OK
HAHAHA Times for ponies :D :D
alright
but seriously... this song has aweird effect on me
/me hugs Saigneur
I agree
the moral is: trust the voices in your head
/me hugs Saigneur.
SWAAAAAAAAAAAAG
I give this movie a 1/10
/me hugs CCCP
At the Gaia! At the Gaia!
I've seen a movie :3
It sounded like most of the voice actors weren't putting too much effort into it
it was bad IMO.
its a 7/10
So basically, it's like the upcoming DmC game.
SPACE MAGIC is bad writing.
I am already kidna depressed... and it makes my chest feel heavy
:'(
My routee reset itself.
its a VG movie, it's SUPPOSED to be horrible
ok now make with the ponys already
Atleast about 8 here.

/me nomz pikorar
Perfectly fine.
anyone else notice that the newsletter says 2 "A" movies?
:[
*Hugs Saigneur*
nothing speedybolt. humanity lives on.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: that is not the point. it's draconian measures for the sake of the company and hoops the customer has to jump though just to play it
out world is in peril, gaia, the spirit of the earth can no longer stand our planet being trashed\
:S
So I'm biased. But please don't accuse me of not trying. That's the only reason I was quiet and otherwise sharing my honest thoughts throughout.
What was this I don't even.
Eww, Gaia!!! :D
/me hugs ThunderCloud
hmm might just be because ive gone to way to many anime cons in my life time

03o_O
It was entertaining, but considering the money that was wasted in this and how it affected square, it really really dislike this movie :p
A terrible, terrible thing.
I give it a low rating for the reason it had nothing to do with what it was based off of
The song <3
Sumica Sorry, just quoting the Nostalgia Critic at the end of his Battlefield Earth movie review......the same reaction goes with this film, honestly <-------- what did that have to do with the game, anyway?
when does the next movie start?
the ending song is actually the best part of this movie. it's legit good.
03good thing I'm on a laptop and have a UPS on my router and modem...

One movie is A because it cost a lot of money. The other movie is A because it earned a lot of money.
JACK IN! MEGAMAN! EXECUTE!

otakon EA and bioware will do the same
But there wasnt even technobabel, just space magic
Its read it and weep up next
NO! NO EASTER EGG! ENOUGH ALREADY! Okay maybe a little. XD

CriticKitten: just out of curiosity, who do you consider the villain here
We at least have to show the thriller video for this
You can do that yes?
OK Saxy, how do I request a movie?

Guys, I want to request a movie for next week. how I do?
This movie isn't so much bad as it is aggressively dumb.

Both good guys and bad guys are morons.
space magic is good
Ponehs! :D
wait
12:c
People, please calm your shit
>Movie about aliens
The villains are clearly the aliens who blew their own planets up and thereby pretty much fucked over earth too.
space magic is the force
42/10
8,6yeah, it's been dead the last few weeks
i prefer advent children by a longshot\
0,14essentially, with the newsletter, you get a link, which will have the spaces for you to fill what movies and what pony eps
Silverscreen: plus one other thing....WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FINAL FANTASY?!
Shup up and take my ponies :"[
NOW CANON
I havent watched ponies since the season final !

I assume Aqui and Sid fucked.
I want Leon The Professional
TWINKLE WISH!
wooooooooooooooooooo
i shall commit せっぱく
Once upon a time there was a good game series, but the writers got lazy and wrote space magic, and everyone's hopes died. The end.
1,11If the movie promoted itself for its technology rather than slapping a Final Fantasy label on it, it would of done a hell of a lot better. Like Avatar did.
Irish_Pony: It's an anthology series. None of the games have anything to do with each other
Is there such thing as a movie with aliens or monsters in it?
I will give my life savings to hasbro if the last line of MLP is "and then they had sex"
AND stop with the "PONIES" spam. It gets you absolutely nowhere
season 3 announced... :D
CriticKitten: which is? that guy who gave his life to save the lives of others in his own way?
00,10guys there was more then one barrier city
i dont give a shit who made this movie get to the ponys :[
Irish_Pony: It doesn't: It must have used the name purely for familiarity.
8,6No video links during the stream please
0,14we actually just showed that a few weeks ago
It was FF because it has a threat to the world's lifestream and a guy named Cid.
You just got pwned FTW
Sid is her FATHER dammit!

It's kind of hard to claim he wasn't evil

can't wait until people get kicked. I'mma lol at that
boo
otakon: Besides, I already had to install a new service pack to actually get the game to install. And I have several years of WoW experience, being constantly online isn't something that bothers me.
@spiritKirz : sorry I didn't won't happen again :)
SORRY KIDS ITS PONY TIME :[
Sumica True........they have no specific order......but i expected a better payoff, the idea was good, but the bulidup was lackluster at best (I know, i'm stating something that Silverscreen already said, but it's true)
GilDash: Thats like calling a movie about WW1 "My Little Pony, Trenches are Friendship"
Gimme ponies! :[
no

Bad Guy = Too @#$% stupid to be truly evil
I did really like that
meh whats with the ads?
Where's the ponies!
Silverscreen: Yeah but still saying that Spirits within TRIED something neweer
Call me old-fashioned or stubborn, but I want a Final Fantasy movie that is true, old-school Final Fantasy proper. It could be a killer fantasy story if done well.
god dam credits holding my ponies
I didn't think it'd be any good
Blue Pochahont... I mean Avatar? :$
Irish_Pony: It's not quite the same, but I get your point. It *is* misleading.

some lawn that I used to mow
I love it
1,11K_A: I could see them doing one. I mean, the story itself would be loosely based on the other games, but the characters, the action, and the overal world wouldn't be THAT hard to replicate to film.
the space opera crowd was working on the movie, so everyone else could do FFX
PONIESSSS!
ty for all you do owners of Bronystate <3

I know that feel spike. I cant spell either.
He can spell 'important' but not 'brink'?
Spike's brain doesn't work in his first scene
Also if you watch Boast Busers ( the episode with Trixie) you'll see that trixie on;y acts like a bitch once all of the other ponies act all rude to her

I really think we have this episode to thank for basically everything. Compare it to the recent Care Bears pilot, it's both funny, properly paced, introduces the main characters to the audience in both a funny and likable fashion, and immediately lets one pick a favorite. And to top it all, it ends in a cliffhanger. I really think that if this episode hadn't been like it is, the fandom would never have caught on

Meanwhile: I read the fic Tiny Wings a few days ago. It was nice to read as Scootalo beat the snot out of Tiamond Tiara and Silverspoon
00,10it seemed like the better plan then reverting to the one hour intermition where we pick winners from chat.
About Gunny: I actually found this first episode of MLP pretty clichè. But my curisoity compelled me to watch the second part and I fell in love with the show when Princess Luna apolgized to Celestia. I then watched all of the episodes up to S2E4 on YouTube and was a brony ever since.
Sweetie it sounds like you have an 8 minute lag on the stream
Luna!
/me tackle-glomps Luna before she can escape
/me hugs Luna
00,10No Silverscreen
Shit
1,11what?
Spoiler, sorry
Midnight_Fyre: Might have to read that.
Do you think it's too farfetched tha he isn't manipulating all the villians?
0,14the votes are already in
/me hugs Luna
00,02Silverscreen, its beeing sorted, new survey system
00,10^
0,14and the lottery already closes
1,11...oh.
13Short story longer, we won't be able to do the newsletters quite the way we did before. Instead, we are working on a new system that should hopefully be better for the future.
actually the first episode I saw was Bridle Gossip. I was hooked immediatley XD
0,14*closed
13Let the techie speak...
^pretty much my story, except I had to wait for season 2
Not that it's a major part of the story, so not an important spoiler
Bridle Gossip was pretty good.
say does anypony know where Euro is useally located (Link Please)
Flutterguy wins
everything forever
so i get some magic muffins, who wants one
Meanwhile: I thought it was really good, though the last chapter felt a bit forced
Hey CoalDust so hows Essex Junction been
If I had to show someone a first introductory episode, I'd show them It's About Time.
StinkomanFan: no, he IS the Spirit of Chaos and Disharmony
/me hugs Luna softly
@_@....
13There is a good chance we won't be able to port the existing mailing list to the new system without major bugs developing. Fortunately, we can streamline the process of registering for the newsletter.
meh
Wooooooooona
essex has been good, kinda borring but good
00,02Shizuka, :O
Hello Everypony!
WHAT MADNESS!?

Essex?
13As always, I am working as hard as I possibly can to get this up and running, but it takes a finite amount of time.
HOLY SHIT

Someone who quits?

0,14tldr, new system will be up

otakon: What's wrong with Grave of the Fireflies?
*Furnus

We have 2 A movies. First movie cost a lot of money. Second movie earned a lot of money.
IMissOsamaBrony: you may get the world's biggest tea party

So was he just randomly bumming around with it or was this malicious Shizuka?
Shizuka whoops, i meant Hard Work

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unico <-- Fantastic Adventures of Unico

omegasparkle: Warning 2, kicked. :P
omegasparkle: no video links during stream please.
hey guys
00,10You did't see it last time?
*there was only one FInal Fantasy movie*
Oh. sorry. I read the newsletter and acording to it the pony episode we just watched was the last
why be careful
SABOTAGE, WUTWUT?
Lol
for me its 9:15
fuast just made a twitter
No need to worry, Dark.
G1 spike sounded like he was on drugs, G3 spike was... awful
if you ask for ponies
1,11No vid links.
Now.
No, no G3. Let's see the live action show instead.
Well, here's hoping he just goofed.
BRB.
ThunderCloud: See ya. :)
What do you recommend, StinkomanFan?
you get ponies
My parents added something new the last last time there were here - a Jack Sparrow wine bottle holder - :) drinking position
/me cowers in corner, with a look of utter confusion on his face
plain and simple
13we have the new survey system up and running, but training is going sloooooooow
ah...
Sumica: enope, RNG was outside of the stream window
00,10I put it on screen like I always do
If you haven't seen meet the pyro yet, I think now's the time to go watch it.
bye GilDash :)
what live action show?
AgentKalim:please stop talking :)
FiM Live action > G3
00,10top right side.
so who wants magic muffins, they give you derp eyes
lauren fuast just made a twitter
Gonna go eat.
What happens if somepony trips and stabs himself on our razor sharp wit?
Spell-of-Gaming: I know :P
Oh.
Sumica: wasn't there last week though
too bad I can't have any wine - Jack's got the right idea though
Cool
I do
then can i politley demand ponies?
Noo my muffins
Spell-of-Gaming: just barely
holy shit me 2
IMissOsamaBrony: TLDR, ask for ponies, you'll get them but they more than likely be the ones you want
All right~!
/me pushes spell-of-gaming off the roof
00,10should have said somthing then.
well, not THEIR wine
muffins for all!!!
Sumica was showing the G3 Ponies, people were like NOOOO, Sumica said "I'll put on G4" and it was the G4 Live Action show. He then swapped it for G1
IMissOsamaBrony you can ask for more ponies
same exact way
IMissOsamaBrony: you don't ask for ponies period
StinkomanFan: We need railings. And lots of 'em.
Derpyrox: I think it's a bit late for someone to go watch a Youtube video. The movie might start before it's over.
Sumi, so last weeks pickers aren't participating
you mean that one that only had twilight, rainbow dash, and applejack?
StinkomanFan: ...what?
but you have no right to demand them
OK, if by some miracle I wasn't the last person to see meet the pyro, you should SEE IT RIGHT NOW. and believe in magic
Ace Attorney: Muffins for all
me shove them through ill catch them
tasty
Sumica: I did, no one listened. Thought it was rigged when Val got picked
Kandarihu: Perhaps...
13plus since we send 571 emails and only like 150 lottery entries come back each week
00,10last weeks winners cant win again
What movie is next?

Kevin bacon is too cool to use a toilet
Weird if you ask me.
IMissOsamaBrony: why are you offended?
Stampede up your ass
Stampeed up your plot... More and more like brokeback mountain by the minute! :O

If I picked movies that I actually like, I'd be trolling too.
Val is made of tougher stuff than...*Left 4 Dead 2 flashback* ok he might have been pissed at the time otakon.
0,14^
No, if there was sheep then this is Brokeback Mountain.

Brokebuck Mountain
Dr_Fumbles: you'll live
The Best thing to yell in an airport is "THAT GUY HAS A BOMB

Or maybe
one of the best movie series ever
I'd pick films that I like, but I don't think most people would enjoy watching them.
That's what he said
Meanwhile: yeah, but I was mostly referring to his troll streams
Freefall29 he said the a word

Is A movie Rated PG or G, And is B movie Rated PG 13 or R?
ohhhhhh

otakon: well he did basically announce that he picked Aguirre to troll us (even though I love that movie). The Fountain on the other hand I hate
Melancholia for A. Yeah, I'm not that heartless
Do you believe in magic?
1,11SA2: Battle is overrated.
Pg 13.
Computer_Pony so you torrent your games, interesting
Besides, you've probably haven't heard of the films I watch. They're pretty underground,.
I vote Grave of the Fireflies because as sad as it is, it -is- a good movie.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The "graboids" are very reminiscent of the giant worms in Dune. Both are giant worms, live underground, live in the desert, have large mouths on the end, and respond to vibrations on the surface. Also, both films have the characters escaping the worms by retreating to rocks where they can't get attacked.
It's like a SyFy special

Across a field with a foot thick slurry of mud that I got stuck in twice. Also, had to strip off 4 layers of clothing to even use the bathroom. Three times and I did not make it twice all the way bc I got stuck. It was worse than just chucking up in your bed in the middle o
