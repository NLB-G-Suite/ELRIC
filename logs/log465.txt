how many comodores were there
00,02 Vordox indeed
What is this

00,02this is not me btw, much smarter guy than i
There were a number of Commodore systems.
3 at least
Phase4: Aww. D:

Oh god
hey Hat hows your day been
00,02http://www.pagetable.com/ << this guys blog, a good read
The Schematics of 6502...
and the atari 2600 and the apple 2
:D good thanks and you?
00,02i have nothing else to stream btw
The SID Chip in the C64 was a 6581
good so far Hat
The C64 wasn't the first Commodore system, either.
/me 00,02understands what those things do :P
oh, some interesting show on the stream
/me does not, but ries really hard
whats is this
/me 00,02ries allso
00,02dat TRUE
hey derpy_pony hows your day been

hey alexxm. it just began

I heard of that one
I'll stick with BASIC Flowcharts. it does what I need, nothing more
also JSR
But don't know what they are D:
as least until I get the CarPC in my Charger up and running
can this guy speak a little bit slower
00,02i'm sure you guys want to see something else but i've streamed everything in my video folder that isnt a letsplay or some other series
So it can only handle 16 variables at once?
Phase
this is interesting
i thought bits had something to do with graphics
Im voting for Assembly Demos
Bits are 4 binary numbers
there's videos of a buy in youtube that does physics really cool
I think..
It was it 8?
Vordox yes 8
00,02a bit is a single 'switch'
00,02its 0 or 1
A bit is a single binary digit.
00,02bytes are 8 bits
A byte is 8 bits

i can't claim to know as much as this guy talking
00,02megatextures are a cool idea
Oh yay 3D stuff... :P
there talking about megatextureing it supposed to reduce lag
and have better textures
if consoles had better hardware maybe
moar pixuls!
More Pixulu
and PC's for that matter
/me just wikis the various terms that pop up
so much graphics

00,02alexxm, meteor hit eath
but the game is so freaking short XD

*Cough*
playstations 3 sucks because it only have half a gig
Playstation is consoles...
00,02its more of a memory problem
xbox 360 have 3 gigs
http://bit.ly/rLXUc0
overcastgabe: Yet they have such incredible games
00,02the ps3 had a bizare memory layout
Damimt
Wrong one

http://bit.ly/KmGve0 <-- right one
I'd say it's a processor problem too
00,02not realy
overcastgabe: because memory is where its at
so is rage good
00,02ps3 has a fairly powerfull processor
has the chat derped
:\
yes but thingk of this i can barly run border lands at max settings
at 40 fps with 16 gigs
OBJECTION
Phase4: how does ps3 have bizare memory layout
Why are we talking about consoles..
As a game designer
hey Ghosties \)
ps3 had 1 gig of ram
so is rage good
Hahaha Vordox xD
thats why fallout and nv for ps3 doesnt work good
Airpuff: It's true =/ My personal enemy
loooooool
04Hello Shane
Vordox: Ehehe :O
PS3 CPU is more like a GPU
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, 256MB system memory, 256MB gpu memory, both exist inside the same address space
00,02bandwidth problems
ohhhh dat babe
Phase4: iz that good?
the cpu is the gpu!
hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane hows your day been
alexxm: Good if you speak about tachnology
bom chica wow wow
the cell broad band engine is both in one
goo alexxm
00,02plus audio memory is in a strange place too
But it kinda fails in gameplay
Phase4: The new PS4 is on the go, so is Xbox and WiiU...
*technology
Phase4: iz what u said good?
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the mapping is, but theres not enough memory for most engines
Phase4: There'll be huge improvements over these 5-6 years of the Console gaps
audio on ps3 suck i cant use my 3 k bose system
Vordox Sony said that they won't
so its bad Phase4 and wens ps4 coming out
Lil_B: It will.
00,02Vordox, i saw a thing that claimed to be the tech specs for the ps4
00,02it claimed some epic large numbers
Phase4: Anything interesting?
my problem wasn't the graphics I really didn't care about
00,02similar memory setup
i have the smallest game on earth
Vordox: anything has to be better than the ancient tech that is current gen consoles
00,02but 10GB instead of 256MB
We won't see anything about PS4 until next year (unless Sony goes back on their word and announces something at E3 this year)
its that I started on the hardest difficulty
Phase4: That's...very very unrealistic...
and got 10 hours of gameplay
00,02plus the thing looks like a damned supercomputer
Phase4: 10 GB?! o.o
Phase4: The risks of having that much within a console station is...
Vordox say specifically said, that they believe the PS3 will work from at least 2 more years
00,02256 SPU's, compared to the 7 in the ps3
Phase4: is the ps4 coming out?
Dude how will someone afford that machine? just saying
/me hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
thats going to use a lot of money meaning loss of profit if it doesnt sell
00,02but this is all rumor, not sure of anything
/me licks nuzzles alexxm
you thik it won't sell?
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, late next year iirc
Phase4: LEGASP
dude 10 gig of video ram thats fuck 5k on a normal computer
Phase4: There's a chance they may have that power, but the cost would be epensive... Unless they reuse old software to maintain that high order of specs. D:
overcastgabe: i know right.. overkill... -.-
00,02the cpu was allso somewhat a hinderance for cross platform, but i blame that on lazy programers
And here is where console contracting begin
my laptop is 8 time faster than an xbox 360 and a 360 is 300$ my alptop was 800$
overcastgabe: but RAM isn't the only thing in the system, someone could make a GPU with 10GB of RAM quite cheaply
00,02fun fact: acording to that document the ps4 will be backward compatible with every other playstation
think of it a 5000$ xbox who the hells going to buy that
who the hell could afford that Phase4
but will they get rid of it
Phase4: LEGASP SRS
the reason why ps3 got rid of backward compatibility
And apperently not have a disk drive from what i heard
00,02ps3 got rid of it due to cost
is because they need 4 cd drives
Phase4: whats the expected price for thr PS4?
00,02it had the ps2 hardware in it
that what i mean
you can emulate offical games
cant
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, no idea, more than i can afford thats for sure
Phase4: 1000$?
o hai Airpuff
PS4 will run solely on Steam
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Atleast :P
Phase4: WAIT!? we can play ALL backwards games?!
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: And hai :)
/me nuzzle, tickles and licks Airpuff
Even back as PSX?!?!?!
1099 UD-Dollars!
00,02Vordox, yes
lol, Live_Essence
now imageion backwards for ps3 ps 2ps1 psx ps 4cd and blu rays
!!!!
00,02they probably just wrote emulators
/me laughs from being tickled by Alicorn_Prince_Shane
>.<
Phase4: I find that VERY VERY ...lying..
/me hugs Airpuff
00,02heck, ps1 and 2 emulators already exist
Phase4: The amount of lost revenue for doing so, would be millions.
/me hugs alexxm back :P
yes but a legit disk is required
00,02to make emulators?
00,02probably not
ps2 ones aren't very good though
legit disk dont emulate
Thats the same reason WII has the emulator inside the game, to be buying old library stuff for a cheap cost.
00,02its cpu is compatible with the ps3, and they had most of a ps2 emulator already
It may be cheap, but the amount of selling is past millions of dollars.
Isn't Sony already in a bit of a financial pinch?
yes they are
Phase4: one question if we had a backwards compat ps3 and played Starwars BF 2? could we play it online?
Twi_Fi: Depends
Alicorn_Prince_Shane
WII has awesome retro games for it
Alicorn_Prince_Shane http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o05xPuZF2I8
All i say, the best machiene when it comes to multiplayer games: N64.
xD
and can ever run youtube
no because starwars shutdown the server last year
00,02and with the ammount of power they have, being lazy with the ps1 emulators performance is acceptible
Twi_Fi yes, they loosing a lot with their electronics department
Airpuff: Golden Eye
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, i assume so
Phase4: LEGASP
Life_Essence: Mario cart .. Mario party. Super smash.
i miss mercenares
Airpuff: 4 fat guys in towels in the snow
it was a good game for ps2
well guys im off to play max payne 3... again
Atleast sony is progressing the tools
Life_Essence: ahaha
Airpuff i agree, best Multiplayer games XD
That 2Sided Television is a great addition to gaming
00,02anyone want to see a talk about the ps3's security system?
i got a joke two person walk in a bar i forgot the rest
bye Alicorn_Prince_Shane
Phase4: Pre theft or post?
00,02pree
00,02pre'
Lil_B: They were so fantastically easy. But awesomely entertaining :
00,02i think
Sure. :P
meh why not
I'm feeling lazy and ignorant
Phase4: why is it really good? or over the top
Phase4: r u gonna stream it?
lol, sounds like a good laugh
00,02its broken in the funniest way
think of this what if we could invent a universal disk drive it would make millions
Phase4: wut is
00,02there are some idiots at sony
00,02the ps3 security
mabey even SEXTILIONS
the sony surity sucks
what is this?
sony spent 50 million on make sonys copy protection
FAIL OVERFLOW
00,02allso some stupids at nintendo, someone used strncmp instead of memcmp, which ment you could fake sign things
very fitting
00,02hence homebrew channel
the copy protection can be defeated by a marker
which is Phase4?
00,02Life_Essence, the ammount of fail in the ps3's security is huge
a fucker maker kills 50 million dalars
00,02alexxm, a way to run homebrew on the wii
00,02sry about the volume
thanks Phase4
00,02its that way on my copy too
50 million by a craona ONE CRAOLA
I think i'll try to put Homebrew channel on my wii when i get the wiiU and play all my Wii games on there
00,02Lil_B, you should, theres some cool stuff on it
overcastgabe: blewup
so Phase4 is this a talk about ps4? or?
wii had a good run? they make it sound like it's dead
00,02the xbox had a very lazy security system, the 360 on the other hand was much better
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, ps3's security system
Phase4 I know, like Emulators and Musicplayers, but right now I'm to worried to brake it
hha Phase4
xbox was ok
this is gonna be funny for ps3
Phase4: Why not just do it like "all out"
Phase4: Fuck security.
00,02you cant run homebrew on the 360, but you can run pirated games
Phase4: Play openly.
00,02little strange
Phase4: what makes the 360 suck though, is its design making the machiene ofthen end in a death from overheating xD
00,02yeah, they screwed up bad with the 360's hardware
>.<
i have the best idea ever universal disk drive like all cds ever blu ray to vhs!?!?!?
Airpuff: that's why you pull it to bits and improve
Airpuff: u kno for example some games life final fantasy on 360 theres 4 disks but on ps3 theres one
yeah byt the rrod could be fixed easy
i fixed the rro xon a 2005 xbox
Sony is such a lying company
rrod
lie*
that 2005 xbox is still working to this day
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no.. i didnt know that xD
bye guys
You know...remove all hackers and the world wouldbe safe, but so ..so...wat's the word?
Airpuff: well now u do
bye alexxm
bai alexxm
Bye alexxm
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Yeah :P
00,02there was allso a very strange bug in the ps3's usb code
00,02later alexxm
/me hugs alexxm "Bai!"
but with no hackers there will be no mods'
Phase4: wat was it
no community
have fun alex
well need hackers
to show how good companies care about you
overcastgabe: Not need.
Hacking is good for the comunity in someways and bad for it in others just saying
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, buffer overflow, you could run code from a usb if you did some strange stuff
microsoft can make or breka you for being suspectd
i was broke
overcastgabe: If we removed all safety on consoles, it would be better, but less personal information = Better to "push away " hackers
? why is ps2 grey?
why iz ps3 not been hacked yet
Phase4: run code?
i was broke my microsoft bought an illigal car on forza 4
00,02ps3 has been hacked
they caught me with it
Phase4: Yep, this was Pre
i didnt know i was used by ahckers but i got insta perma ban
it
Phase4: yea like last year
Phase4: all our details got leaked
oh shit! what details
)-o ps3 os is linux
Phase4: Yet there was very very instances of theft or abuse of the details
where we live ip?
overcastgabe: didnt u hear?
Which one is you, Phase4?
no
00,02i 'think' the bluray private keys got released
00,02Twi_Fi, none of them
overcastgabe: it was on the news last year
Phase4: :D

Phase4: Who are they....poking fun at?
This video amuses me.
00,02Vordox, sony
newcloppingrepublic.tumblr.com
overcastgabe give me a better link
Phase4: So they are exposing issues?
lol
www.newcloppingrepublic.tumblr.com
<.<
How is that a bad idea?
Just cause "They want revenge"?
One does not simply... piss of hackers
hey guys, wat are we watching
overcastgabe: OH GOD
because now they are out to destroy them
OVER 9000
Hello rdibp
00,02Vordox, have you ever seen what happens when you try to controll a geeks tech?
i told you!
00,02<< this is what happens

aaaaaand he IS outa heeere!
DONT
what are we weatching?
watching*
00,02rdibp, a talk about the ps3's security
gooodbyeee overcast!
Phase4: Buuuuut....
well i have no interest in ps3 sorry XD ima outta here
Dear Princess Celestia, Today i learned what clop means .-.
is this like e3 or something?
Phase4: It's dumb, by hackers...
Really dumb
Cya Deadeagle
I TOLD YOU DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISH WIREDO
00,02Vordox, they enjoyed using other-os on their ps3's, sony stopped them doing that
Makes them look like pure criminials out for revenge rather then having a reason for what they may be able to do
00,02so they fixed it
risk
Phase4: But it's LEGAL on their part to do so
._.
Vordox Its basicly, "Oh you want to do that? Well we don't let you!" and the hackers are like "Well, we gonna show you D: !"
but im sooooo curious its dangerous
I dont understand this, i dont speak telechonese.
00,02and its legal for the hackers to do so ^_^
http://arch.413chan.net/1288859782062.jpg
yeah like i jailbroke my iphone
How is IT legal for them to CHANGE PS3?
technolonese
the goverment says one you but it you have full rights
Cause they are chinese
thats how i can jailbreak my iphone leagly
buy
00,02can do whatever you want with something you own so long as you dont break any other laws
Phase4: Correct, and everything within it as a full schematic.
Vordox, it is their PS3, they have the right to do anything with it they ont.
Implying jailbreaking is illegal
and chinese people are powerful
Which it isn't
Here at least
like if you dont pirate if fine
Lil_B: Yeah, that's my point
if you dont pirate
Phase4: Which is fine, so how is it legal for Hackers to change things within it?
achivement unlocked: become a hack nerd
00,02i'm allowed to change the software on my laptop
Phase4: Oooh, thye implemented a OS3?
00,02ps3 is the same
Phase4: I thought that was not true anymore
dshannon: Remember when they said they were going to put that law in place here that would fine you if you torrented? Lol.
00,02thats what the geohortz case was abotu
00,02about'
Phase4: Geohortz?
00,02kinda annoyed they settled that one, never set a precident
.......yes....wait no?......that happened?
do you think valve is just trolling us by saying they arent going to present anything at E3 this year?
overcastgabe thats not very nic
00,02http://hackaday.com/2011/04/12/geohot-case-settlement/
:D
well you wanted to know
aparently you wanted to see it
dshannon: That did cone into effect. I just havnt heard anything about it. Me and my mates still torrent like crazy and none of us have heard shot about it.
spoa passed now a uk student is being extrdited for terrist act for dowloading 1 song illigaly
us i lake a uk student
whats spoa?
is takeing
SOPA has not passed yet
It won't pass.
Phase4: Didnt geohot like... invent the jailbreak for the iPhone or somehint
something*
00,02XAX, yeah, he did that too
geohot did the iphone AND the ps3
the internet will NEVER DIE!!!
^
Phase4: What was his main accomplishment?
00,02he worked on the ps3
XAX: <Notice> You are to cease and desist all torrenting activities immediately.
Ph
Twi_Fi: k sorre admon won't do it agen
00,02something about some keys he leaked or some thing he did to his ps3 made seca angry, so they tried to sue hi
00,02him'
Well, with the Rasberry Pi, hacker groups are already making plans to "make a second Internet" with low-orbit sattelites and consumer ground stations
dat accent
00,02as such the code he wrote to create signed executables was mirrored by damn near everyone
00,02i have a copy
heh heh heh heh....this touches me in a special place... http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/132648590590-Marvel_secret_butt_f.jpg
00,02<< what their talking about now
Lil_B: You serious!
00,02he wrote code to creat 'self's
i can survive on a diet compised entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
Phase4: What would you use said code to do?
00,02run code on the ps3
i....i...i think im gonna delete my history now..... O-o
composed
What kind of code? What would it let you do on your PS3?
00,02XAX, anything
Twi_Fi currently, its only plan, but it is possible with recent technology with not much money
ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!
Play me some pokemon red on my PS3
i can survive on a diet composed entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
00,02yup
00,02XAX, but sony doesnt want you to do that
That's cool :o
Lil_B: That is something I have wondered if it could be possible.
00,02hence the court case
/
im gonna go now bye
bye
/me doesent even own a PS3
Lil_B: I'm happy that such things are being considered.
/me kind of wants a PS3
Bye doug..........noooooooooo, gone!!!!!!!
00,02too many loaders
Twi_Fi the Sattelits would be about ballon sized, you could launch a hundret with one go, and the ground stations would be ~100$ but right now, its all theoretical
i can survive on a diet composed entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
I would probably only use it to play PS1 games from the store, and PS2 games that I have. I'm down right horrible at playing FPS games on consoles.
I can't do I for the life of me
it*
I'm pretty happy with my own PS3, overall. Despite all the complaining about consoles. And XAX, finding a PS3 that's backwards compatible to PS2 games is very hard now.
ps3 is okay
PC GAMING FOR LIFE
Lasharus: fffffffffffffffff
Twi_Fi but its so awesome that all f this is very much possible, and nobody would shoot them down, because you don't want scrap metal floating around, hraming all other sattelites XD
Only the very first few models did that, most of the later ones no longer had the backwards compatibility.
Bronysith: Omgyes
I have one of the very first models. *smug*
00,02the ps3's with 'emotion engines' are rare and expencive
I like my PS3, but I accidentally broke my backwards compatible one >_>
Phase4: That's why I'm smug. :P
So I had to go back to my PS2 for the old games.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOj-Ssf4y8&feature=related watch i dare you worst them my last post it will smash you mind in to puny cracker
Phase4: Emotion engines? >_>
XAX: u a pc gamer?
00,02XAX, the ps2's cpu
00,02Lasharus, lucky you
Bronysith: Since I was 3
I'm just a gamer Bronysith. PC, PS3, DreamCast...
The PS2 which is modded, btw
I don't care about the medium, gimme games.
Lasharus: pc gaming is best gaming
00,02now this right here is epic fail
Oh no no no, not going into a "best platform" discussion.
I CAN SURVIVE ON A DIET OF CRayons and lighter fluid
Each platform has its merits and demerits.
Lasharus: cept PC its just really good
Oh good grief.
oh plese i can surrvive a diet of hot pockets
Phase4: But what if you jailbroke it? Would it play PS2 games then?
I greatly enjoy PC games. I also greatly enjoy PS3 games. I.e. stuff the 'best system' concept.
00,02that line of code is a high-school i learnt on basic mistake
Any questions?
overcastgabe: they are the same thing really
thats hard they fucked eplode in your hand nearly killing youw ith 1degree burn from melting cheese
I love how everyone applauds after each ding.
00,02XAX, not without the hardware or an emulator
Right
Phase4: can u survive on a diet of crayons and lighter fluid?
00,02this bit
Admittedly, squealing about how hard the PS3 failed now is a bit behind the curve, if I'm honest.
00,02is epic fail
00,02sony failed so hard
Yeah, they screwed up. Oh deary me.
00,02Bromany, lighter fluid is probably toxic
Are there games on my PS3 that I like? Yes? Okay, I'll go play those games then.
im Bronysith
huh ?
Phase4: im Bronysith not Bromany
I realise they buggered up massively, but at the same time, it doesn't affect me and it won't affect me, so I feel very little reason to go up in flames about it. :P
00,02lol
00,02sry
^^
Phase4: its fine
/me 00,02hugs Bromany and Bronysith
how old is the guy talking right now?
Hello Bromany
hi there, Twi_Fi
00,02Lil_B, dont know
00,02thats the fail right there
The same random number every time? Did they roll a dice and hardcode the result?
what would happen if we combined brony and the steam store?
Hello RainbowAsh
Hi Twi_Fi
00,02k
00,02is the private key
00,02the bit thats suposed to be secret
That's...the secret?
I hate k from all of my Physics lessons :/
wat
i honestly have a derpy hoover floting around my screen
hooves
00,02with it, you can sign things and they are indistinguishable from sony's signitures
....
Phase4: THE MIGHTY K
LAWL
www.desktopponies.com
lol xkcd joke
dare you
overcastgabe: Implying no one else knows about desktop ponies
Full open sources...
oh so im suppoed to have my pen and stick it in my tv?
Yeah, just do that.
Then film it and put it on youtube
maybe they should show Desktopponys on the Stream... would be a nice addition :V
Goodness knows I could use a laugh.
DESKTOP PONIES WHY YOU NO WORK FOR ME!!!
rage
Lil_B, more than half the streamers have that program active.
actually, i didn't know about desktop ponies till yesterday :'(
Lasharus I know XD
no it would derpy hooved will make it buffer and then say i JUST DONT KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG!
Bronysith: I have a boot screen rainbow dahs
Ah, sorry, I failed to pick up on the sarcasm.
dash*
Phase4: So they go through XBox an Wii too?
Phase4: Or are they bias arseholes? =P
ive been up for 2 days !??!
00,02Vordox, these guys did the wii, other guys did the xbox
crap
Phase4: Good, hate one sided critizise. :P
Agreed.
omg todays monday shit!!
overcastgabe: How old are you?
wat is this?
If they'd only focused on the PS3, I would've discounted most of this. :p
Vordox Nintendo didn't really pissed off so much people XD
overcastgabe: doesnt matter to me i am outta school
14
Ah.
Hello pony_911
well
00,02the ps3 had horribly broken security
hi whats this?
00,02but the xbox was worse
time to pl,ay kotor
Phase4: Thank you :P
00,02pony_911, talk about the ps3's security system
The XBox had a shoddily designed console. :P
/me is still reppin' the PS2
00,02i'm probably going to reboot and play a game now
ohh i dont have a ps3
I mean, if the original console is practically guaranteed to fail? Something's misdesigned. :p
my xbox does need a upgrade asap though
Ghehe.
I don't own an XBox.
Oh no, wait, I tell a lie. When my brother went to China he gave me his old one. It's gathering dust... some...where.
That question, her her her
Damnit, now I'm going to have to search for it, aren't I?
00,02the xbox's security is broken, the xbox 360's is ok
00,02except for the fact that you can pirate games
00,02cant run your own code but you can pirate
True enough Phase4, but the XBox 360's console design is a bit worrisome for me.
00,02:P
00,02its hardware is shoddy]
I cant pirate games its no ok with my religion
00,02i have a broken one here, suffered 3 different faults
Sorry, but if "to red-ring" becomes an industry for completely failing, I tend to shy away from buying the system. :P
00,02reboot time!
*an industry term
when doesn E3 start again?
i fixed the rrod permanetly for my 2005 orignal xbox 360
Phase4: Sleep time
just do a headsink mod
I'm impressed. That's fairly rare.
Have fun with your games
Sleep well XAX
the only problem im having now is that i cant connect to xbox live ....yet
Goodnight XAX
are you going XAX?
night XAX
Lil_B: It's 5 minutes till half past 11. Yeah :#
Airpuff: hows the drawing?
good mooning? pax
ok, good night XAX
stream end?
Phase4 is just rebooting, then he'll stream games.

overcastgabe: you do know you can do this whole war thingy in a private room ?
Ah, lovely.
oh yeah how?
Create your own
how?

Now really |Discord|. I roleplay Robotnik for my own personal amusement. I don't expect anyone to pick up on it. :P
00,02Ghosties, Ping
00,02Ghosties, Ping Ping
Is Phase4 summoning the god?
Well, that appears to be the sensible thing to do here.

So please dat-muffins...I like you an all but just stop with the emotocons
Fear Ghosties!
i have ones
those things look incredibly creepy
wones!!!
Fear him!!!!!!!
Ghosties: Wake up.
wat a lovely day... bronystate got visited by some new kids...
Do not awake the silent serpent!
But yeah, if my taking the role of Dr. Robotnik as a joke was annoying, I do apologise.
valoreins: More like trolls if you ask me
Dr_Robotnik: :D
Amusement was my intent, after all, not annoyanc.
Dr_Robotnik: This is merely a social stream and chat.
*annoyance.
well they are acting like one
Dr_Robotnik: any other activieis can be refered elsewhere
That's fair enough.
I just picked it up for a laugh after the whole emote spam.
overcastgabe: blows up
Dr_Robotnik: How would you like it if a random person ran into your house and starting doing yoddeling? :P
And be honest, if I'd ordered the Egg Fleet to fire and they'd then get banned, you'd have laughed. I know I would've. :P
I swear, I come on this chat and there is dancing, mass licking, or emote spam.
Dr_Robotnik: I would... XD
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Don't forget Dusting
Lolz you guyz
Anyway, I'll try to curb the joke RP a bit. :)
and glomp pile
CHAAASE
yeah got to go fast real fast your too slow way fast cool totaly radical gotta speed up
So, with that in mind, back to Lasharus.
chilli dogs
thats no good
Oh my god why does he call her Miss Jane?
Much better.
inb4 Lasharus gets banned.
Why would I get banned Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit?
Lasharus: Just kidding.
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: If anything he fed the troll, nothing too bannable about that
It's against the rules to threaten with bans. You could get banned.
Dat_muffin and overcastgabe is the ones in danger here.
But I have not the power.
Lasharus: Do you know of any good roleplay servers?
(Is it against the rules? I have no idea, really :P)
00,02sry bout that
00,02power dropped
in the thin ice
It is aganist the rules
None whatsoever |Discord|. I just picked up RP'ing Dr. Robotnik some time ago through a forum.
I have not the power........
Phase4: Right in a chase? :(
im on the thin ice
00,02 Vordox yup
|Discord|: What is?
00,02i totaly didnt fail right after either
We had a halloween event where we could change our forum names, so I became Dr. Ivo Robotnik. And started an Ask Robotnik thread.
00,02<_<
It's still going strong. :P
00,02>_>
Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Rolelay
00,02hmmm, wont let me restart the stream
I laugh at that rule because roleplay happens waaaaaay too often here.
After 76 pages of answering questions, it's astonished me. :P
Well good streaming then Phase4 XD
I tend to stay away from doing so while on the mane chat though.
00,02!ping
00,02huh
Yeah, same here Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit. I just succumbed for once. :p
00,02my internet still works
two shots are what ever its like tug of war trying to pull myself togeter im a pimp under pressure live my money on the dresser
00,02wonder what happened there, power went again
leave
tell me where is that from
A pretty bad song.
yep
Lasharus: You had succumbed to the dark side of the chat.
The moment the word 'pimp' is mentioned, it's almost certainly going to be a bad rap song, and thus loses my interest altogether.
00,02ok, i cant seem to push to the embed
00,02gona change it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjIhs72l0A&feature=fvwrel <--- While we wait
two are what ever its like tug of war tring to pull myself togeter i could problably do beter but that like never im a pimp under pressure
lol
See? Again with the 'pimp' reference. I'm going to assume the horrendous song's title is something like 'pimp under pressure', because the guy can't seem to ramble about anything else.
00,02ok, everyone refresh your streams
00,02had to change embed
streamseption

mothman vs. bigfoot, deathmatch, at the heart of Mt. Doom. commence debating
/me likes mothman.
Ohai everypony~
XD
and Ohai Phasestream :3
Hello Starflash
o hai Starflash
So Bronystate was founded on September 13, 2011?
Starflash: Holla! :)
Eeyup
6_9
that's when the channel was registered
Hai Starflash
Well I guess my next question becomes pointless now.
heh
Twi_Fi: remember the anniversary some time ago :D
that was pretty much the ehmm
anniversary
Oh yeah :D
:D
Twi_Fi: However, the website lists movie nights long before then.
also, is this game worth playing? it looks pretty one sided
/me sits on Sky
WAHAHAHAHA
earliest recorded movie night: 2011-05-13
10hi
reading the latest fairy tail, Erza just became a boss
ehm that sounds about right
yes
ohi Skylands
Ryunosuke: Erza is always boss. xD
I am amazingly
still on
i got your message last night
Ah thats right. gotta read up on fairy tail sometimes :T
true... but more so now :)
hurr durr
you're a big peadge
lol, the button and perl
pearl'
i like it that way
)':
incorrect draw order
I'm not that /fat/
So ponies only became a focus later or was it always since the site's inception?
i was more thinking age but ok
the internet is so boring these day
:P
just because we like ponies, doesnt mean that ALL we like are poneis :)
/me glomps
It doesn't?
Oh
besides
titi
hihi*
LOL
ponies 24/7 would get real old real quick ;)
oo
Yeah I guess.
and hah
I'm not as old as you yet
>:p
Twi_Fi: began as a movie night for bronies :3
Some bronies are already getting burned out now as it is.
And it is making me sad.
what, how the community is pretty much degrading?
THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE WORKED XD
Starflash: Degrading?:(
/me old?
one should always tkae ponies in moderation, just like anything addictive and potentially hazardous to your health
well, that may be a bit too extreme.
but you know what I mean.
you're ancient
Starflash: Yeah, I think I do.
We need that Fighting is Magic game ASAP.
;;
ikr
every second of that last room i did all wrong
and it worked
huh aaaahhh
this game is soo much fun XD
Twi_Fi the hell we do ,when will it come out again?
>fuse in paralel
if you're an electronics nerd you'll know why thats wrong
eeyups
Skylands sure
pew pew
haha, ilu guys
pony_911: I'm not sure. Trying to find out now.
Actually, does anypony know when the Fighting is Magic game is intended to come out? It looks from the website that it won't be for a long time.
You got kicked by Phase4_. You will explode in 3 seconds.
XD
bge logic
watching beyond good and evil really makes me miss the good old platformers like: Donkey Kong 64, Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, Conkers Bad Fur Day and so forth
what the heack
Fighting is Magic will be become the Duke Nukem Forever of brony games, calling it now
did you guys hear him die?
Twi_Fi i dont think it will come out at all
StupidSexyCJ: what do you mean?
Twi_Fi: The usual fan-made reply is, "when it's ready".
Then i r glad
pony_911: They are still working on it, but the longer it takes the less likely it will be finished.
Hey everypony Im back from destroying tanks :)
In my opinion.
Welcome back, Irish_Pony.
ehm: True.
/me dead tired
Starflash: we'll wait years for it to come out, then when it does, the finished product wont be quite what we were expecting
ehm: And if it takes them time to do it right, then I welcome it.
Dat voice acting
ahh.
10Couldn't fall asleep due to the warm weather, I suppose
oh well
10Last time I checked my clock, going on 3:30am
I would try to create my own game if I had any knowledge or talent in the area.
10And we've woken up to hear our air conditioner outside is making odd noises, that'll need to be fix. I pray it doesn't just suddenly stop working
Twi_Fi how long has it been since the projrct started?
then mod some other game
at least here the nights aren't as warm .ww.

Sylandest: I do have my way with ponies, don't I? ;)
GilDash: yes, yes you do...:$

Lolz best song ever.

I beg to differ.

and its incredibly counterintuitive
damn... that sounds bloody if you have no video to the audio
Phase4_: and u did it without cheating
good job
well....
Sylandest: I think you like that really. ;)
May I remind you that video games are fun or do I have to remind you the hard way?
fun fact
/me picks up bat.
i had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM
GilDash: *looks away embarassed* n-no! :$
last time i played
|Discord|: there is no fun in cheating
you go into here and assume you cant go through
because double h buggs out and doesnt follow
/me drinks some cider

*anypony
Nah, I need to grow a stache and then wx it.
waxing sounds painful
No..>?
O.o

No, wax as in like... gel it :D
Waxing eyebrows is painful, of course, but waxing a stache just means you make it all curly.
What in the world???
O.o
Irish_Pony: i know not...lol
0,5VAT IN ZE VURLD

0,5What are you, a kahjiit?
Irish_Pony: when is whiskey ever unhappy? I thought it was an eternal fountain of joy?
The spectre of sleep is approaching fast.

GilDash: Wusa matter? Getting driven in sane?
Explanationtime!
00,02part of me wants to follow it, a larger part is yelling "THOSE PLANES HAVE LEGS"
Phase4: just use suspension of disbelief. it works wonders, lol
00,10think of it like this, they are robots with wings
00,02XD
Phase4 if it makes you feel better, they also transform into robots
thrustworthy people :/
00,02Dken2021, that bit makes even less sense
think of it like a transformer with three modes
Om: Something like that. >_<
plane, plane with legs, robot
00,10it's reverse enginered ailen super tech
GilDash: Just stick to it, and you'll pull out just fine.

Merc_Xephos: hi there
Irish_Pony: I'm going to need a muzzle myself at this rate... >_<

00,02Bronysith, its an excelent game you should definantly buy nad play

GilDash: So I guess you dont need me :P
00,10that doesnt sound like a good thing
00,02Bronysith, about the same time from ubisoft so probably
that happened to me once
A spider I thought could jump
was ON MY KEYBOARD
x_X
00,02few rough edges (i streamed one today) but still excelent
Then I freaked and ran out of the room
Phase4: awesome. ill make that the next steam game i buy. right now im content with KOTOR
Sumica sometimes you just need a little bit of of victory feeling :/
ok, i'm back. And what is going on in this party-zone?
xD
then I came back with a stick LOL but it was gone ;-;
Sumica: he's a professional amateur?
Sylandest: im professional russina

Moral of the story
GilDash: What do you think of those one pice jump suits?
lol, doody
Bronysith: haha! :D
00,02i'll look into it
Spiders are sneaky b*stards
00,02suposed to be good
you know what? this doesn't deserve my bad spelling
Om: I'm not watching the stream right now.
Phase4: yea. its a little buggy on steam. but not game ending bugs
Om: Thank the godesses...
00,10it's rather dated so far as how it looks
00,02jolly good, now lets have tea and biscuits
12I just trap them in plastic containers, put a piece of paper under it andthen let it free in the garden
00,10but still a fun game
Phase4: and krumpets
12however moths in my room will die
00,02and krumpets
13I WOULD do that but I'm too scared to go anywhere near it LOL
GilDash: Well you missed a good piliot put his jet though some great manouvers
Sumica: better than most modern games howeever
12because they'll want to eat mah plooshies
13I have no problem with bees/wasps though, which I'll happily trap in a glass and let it go outside xD
Om: I swear...
12I love them
00,02dat accent
00,10it plays just like mass effect
00,02his accent is awesome
12a honeybee was trapped in my room few days ago
wtf

13we literally sat there for hours waiting for a bite
13nothing happened
12patience ;3
13or maybe it was just a bad day for fishing so I dunno xD
Dark_Horst: oh wow, i remember that
02It was a bad day of finishing
00,10just let any kid fly

12<
Dken2021: this series is from the 80s
12<3
12fuzzy
what are we watching
Oh we're watching that anime where everything is retro-futuristic and there are explosions. Like almost every other anime ever.
13eww tarantulas D:
02Fishing with a stick which as a small rope tied.
13they don't scare me as much
02with a small hook at the end
13but still
13e.o
pikorar: michael bay meets japan? XD
i'm bored...:(
00,02this feels like a game intro
12They're not as bad as spiders
do a barrel roll
02yep, the stick tends to break, A LOT>
at least the jet designs in this one make sense
DO A BARREL ROOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLL
00,10he got shot in to the past
pikorar: clearly your experience with anime is limited to the stuff that gets licensed... in the 90s
Hey
I ate a maggot once
00,02eject?
While fishing
12Ew why
Actually I no barely ANY 90's anime.

Use the boost to get through!
No

Oh damn

Sumica: 10/10
fun fact: a barrel roll is not the maneuver that starfix wants us to believ it is
nice legs...
12and yeah some are harmless
thank you, all these people are now dead
Oh wait, no, it's that anime where the entire city gets destroyed but no one cares.
and some of his clothes went derp
transformers robots in deguise
We need to get some anime on this stream that's a bit less stereotypical. Too much action.
Only killed about 20 people :) np

Suicide is bad!

Sylandest1: .....what kind of crazy intro was that?:D
WallDives: find your rage, harness it, EAT IT!!
Oh yeah
Very_Silly_Filly: it is a headache, and if you know any of it from before hand watching anime/video games, you will probably need to unlearn it.
WallDives: BANZAI!!!
It's Monday
Derp
Oh Nichijou, u so random! :P
TheRainbowDash: watch the show, and you will understand...maybe...
This is a spacial kind of insane

Sorry I was making a quick adjustment to my OC description what I miss?????
This anime is now rythm heaven
TheRainbowDash: this is specifically meant to not be understood
Finisher!
Oh damn
I had to go to a drama rehersal and we had to go in Pjamas....... My crush was walking and I had to run past him in pjamas hoping he wouldn't see me I closed my eyes while running with hands full of books -.-
Alright...
The definition of high is your brain on anime.
ingwaz: Ah, I see. One of those things that not knowing the true purpose of it is better for your health.
00,10wonder if any one did a spart mix of that
Most likely
Oh...I wish I had misses this :P
TheRainbowDash: like a lot of things, especially here.
TheRainbowDash: if you try to understand it, your brain will break. Thus, we don't understand, merely laugh and enjoy :D
There's a Sparta Remix for everything
strangest thing about this song...both the male and female part are sung by the guy
dat engrish
dafuq is with the clockwork winds?
Sylandest1: Hahaha, I see.:D

Then again
Sylandest1: I'm willing to take that challenge, if I got time.

She has no plan
D:
Sumica: Still sharp...:D
and then there's dialects.
00,10might burn too as it's like candy
'dat lack of nose
This is the kind of random that happens when you RP... Not even once should apply nicely
hai
Imo, I find it annoying how the original language is less popular
TheRainbowDash: let me put it like this. I have witnessed from this show the following: goats, a wrestling principal, pocket dimension guns, robotic children, child professors, and reality defying acts of physical prowess. comprehension: impossible. Enjoyment: quite high
Om: Hmm?
Oh hai CCCP

Blond is a crime.
Bruce looks like he has a wedgie.
Om: Harley was originally a blonde.
Before she turned evil.
00,10I would say try refreshing to get a better conection to mips

Harley is still a blonde when she's evil.

Om: Probably.
00,10would be funny if Bruices pants started ringing
Facepalm...
Sumica: i would laugh my butt off
Wow. Red phone glows red
Litwick: That is just sad...
Om harley was made for the 90s cartoon as far as i'm aware
Sorry commisioner, but batman is standing 2 feet away from you.
So I was looking at the animated series Batman
alexxm: She was in the comics as well.
And now I'm looking at Adam West.
question on the side, are you guys going to stream korra again?
DICK! LOL! It never gets old!
alexxm: I did not know that.
just curious
00,10can I have that evidance, you dont need it
what? Police managing to do something on their own?

Harley Quinn and H.A.R.D.A.C. are canon immigrants from Batman TAS to the comics.

Obvious trap is obvious

Irish_Pony: i guess it's a "yes" :D
Shamroc: I...don't know let me check
11,01Dken2021: Saw that vid (EA in a Nutshell), and it was spot-on.
I'd call you a bastard for conning us, even though I knew that was the case
/me has a troll face
I can't believed I clicked that DoublePint smacked his forehead lol
But that song is so epic
wait
will we ever have a Mods V viewers again ever
:O
08,01owlicious: i know i would
ACS13123: maybe
lol
Hmm. I think the only difference between 1.4.6.3 and 1.4.6.5 might be an update to the Hungarian version.
So... who here has read "When The Wind Blows" and wants to help me with a project? :3
brb
Nopony? Didnt think so....lol
What's your favorite game of all taime?
Team AVO deserves ice cream.
Videofreak1127: chrono trigger and ff7 tie along with ff6
Would the mods be terribly angry with me if I did an experiment and saw what happened if I used a white font with a black highlight?
too many to count
LoZ: WW for me
maybe Kandarihu
Team AVO deserves ice cream.
pyrocatboy: Yes they do...
Anyway, my version is 1.4.5.3, which lags horribly. I'm going to take my chances with the latest version I can find. It might take some jury rigging on my part. This could take all afternoon.
Luna_of_Assassins: the result is auto kick
pyrocatboy: Indeed they do
RaveBrony isn't when the wind blows written by the guy who wrote fungus the boogeyman
alexxm: I dont know.... i dont read :(
Shamroc: I got a strange Reserve Shooter,Pistol,Bottle,Loch-n-load,Detonator,Triblemens Shiv, and Boston Basher. That is it
/me hates reading more than ANYTHING
:'(
|Discord|: i have 4 of those
/me sings "Yar har, fiddle deedee, Being a pirate is alright to be!! Do what you want cause a pirate is free, U ARE A PIRATE!!!!"
RaveBrony aww, but why?
/me enjoys reading a good book every now and then
Shamroc: Any interest you?
RaveBrony: You do realize this a text based chat, yes?
so whats the project RaveBrony
|Discord|: nope
Dken2021: Idk.... I just find Everything more fun than reading :\
I read the last Harry Potter book in less than 2 days
I HATE EA
Shamroc: Well that is okay. Can't get everything ya want know can you?
/me cleans his M1 Grand
I just got to find the right person
|Discord|: nope
I hate when plastic gets melted onto your toast
/me LEWIS! Lewis come quickly! An airplane has crashed on your father!
RaveBrony well when the wind blows is a graphic novel
Irish_Pony: I have a broken Minigun at my house!
11,01I wonder if Civ 5 is still on sale.

Princess_Cadence: I hate Tirxie so much that I barf when I hear her name.
Hai thar everypony! Also Shizuka

Shimmer: Hai
|Discord|: I love Trixie
Beats DoublePint
13unsurprisingly, little quarter inch spacers fall out if you push their tiles away...
allo Shimmer
|Discord| Why so? Well whatever song is still great.
lol
11,01Shit. Missed the sale.
Only books ive ever read, were read in class....
11,01I actually enjoyed Civ V
Princess_Cadence: Because I know TO many people like her in my life
/me watches Irish_Pony cleaning his M1 but accidentally shoots with it and kills himself
Great. I check The Pirate Bay. It's right there, but now I have to figure out magnet links.
Dken2021: Oh ya. Just finished reading it. It's a future military setting with some dark themes
They hate her too lol
Nittany_Discord: darn you shoulda told me i bought it for me and sb64 yesterday
When did Civ 5 come out?
I know what our next mod v viewers event should be. Minecraft Hunger games
Ahhh you'll find your special somepony |Discord|
Videofreak1127 sounds interesting
11,01I asked.
11,01Generally.
11,01Oh well.
o.o brb i need to pay for staying lol
Also, everyone has to download Mine Little Pony, so we can have PONY HUNGER GAMES
Dken2021: It gets pretty screwed up in parts
Luna_of_Assassins: But Im not hungry
DerpStar: I doubt it bro. Most girls hate me cause I am well...anyoing. I would like to meet a nice Pegasister one day but that will have to wait
/me barf with |Discord| hearing at Trixie's name
I looked at Civ V on Steam. Looks like the devs are being a bit mean with the DLC
11,01The only thing I hated about last night game night: We never hit a sever with mod support.
back
I have mine little pony
But why is my skin Bonbon D:
Nittany_Discord: All those Luna retextures gone to waste??? :'(
Nittany_Discord: Those servers dirve me crazy! HEY YOU GOT POINTS TO SPEND! I hate that...
never could get mine little pony mod to work
Very_Silly_Filly: it's random :D
ILL BRB EVERYPONY have to work. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
I know that
11,01I mean ones supporting user mods.
ovr and ovr and ovr agian it just sucks
13it's cause you're modifying models and textures, which makes sv_pure mad
is your copy ready, Kandarihu?
13and we were on official servers all night
First I'm a woman |Discord|, just adjust your way of thinking I'm sure she'll come along
Be patient you'll see,you may call it fake but this is real MAGIC....REAL MAGIC
sv_pure: umad
13sound mods worked perfectly for me
11,01In other words, my MLP weapon skins didn't show up.
Very_Silly_Filly: mine was a fluttershy *d'awwwws*
lol DerpStar don't need to jack my laptop
DoublePint: Maybe your right.
11,01Not for me.
Nittany_Discord: yep...
Not yet. I'm gonna try to torrent it, but last time I was on TPB, there were torrent links. Not anymore.
11,01And I have a sound mod.
11,01Two.
It was closer!
11,01One for weapons, and the jockey mod.
aww man :( i need to go now
Guys, we really need to do techniks on MC if we haven't done already
11,01None of them worked.
For MP
Kandarihu: all you need to do now is to click on the magnet, Kandarihu. It works pretty much the same way as before.
I need a BRIAN BLESSED mod
bye Princess_Cadence
see you all at june 5th now everybrony/pony! :(
Honestly, the only reason I actually play the damn game
/me sighs
laters, Princess_Cadence
bye Princess_Cadence
Cya Princess_Cadence
Ya know what I find funny? Kriz kept me on his friends list after the game. I assumed him to take me off right after but he didn't...I wonder why?
Princess_Cadence: brohoof
/me waves sadly and goes
I click on the magnet and Firefox asks me what program to use to open magnet links.
I think I may have acidentaly ingested some plasitc
Nittany_Discord: I have that :D
11,01I didn't install it because I couldn't dare stream that.
STOP CISPA
:(
CISPA new SOPA
CCCP: It already passed dude
:O
13i just disable the opening vid..
11,01It hasn't.
D:
I want more wenches More wenches and mead Lots of wenches is what I need
CISPA is worst pony
/me sings " I GOTTA GO TO EAT!!! â™ª"
cya later
08,01# toss the fig and save the date #
|Discord|: really? ;_;
Nittany_Discord: Ghost said it did.
IM HERE TO CENSOR YOU ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11,01RIAA and MPAA are worst ponies.
To quote Left 4 Speed 2: "That, was the scariest ******** thing that I've ever seen in my entire life."
13WE HAVEN'T HAD A CRISIS ON THE INTERNET THIS WEEK FIND ONE NOW
bye Magical_pablez94
08,01Nittany_Discord: this. very much this.
You guys in the States still pasing laws like that?
bye Magical_pablez94
Shizuka: The trolls trolled me agen :c
bye
Cya Magical_pablez94
Bye Magical_pablez94
Shizuka: you could do the fact i wasnt here yesterday to watch the stream :'(
08,01inb4 i move to sweden into wrek's basement.
bye
I outsourced my resource mining in Minecraft to my little sister :D
08,01|Discord|: i'm listening to pony music
have fun Magical_pablez94|EAT
All I heard about so far is the U.N. wanting to regulate the internet.
08,01Very_Silly_Filly: but... sweden has wrek, and internets and stuff
Kandarihu that's because the majority don't even know it exist
08,01Irish_Pony: YES
No I'm just saying your government is still trying to pass laws that are extremely unpopular
I'd like to visit Britain sometime
But Britain has british people. And me
One does not simply regulate the internet.
13not trying, succeeding
GilDash: Which color do you wanna be? xD
11,01Yeah. Hollywood meddling in politics to support their forced; heavily controlled and outdated business models and copyright-based censorship makes my blood boil.
13and that's the wonders of a political elite that shields itself from its constituents
Airpuff|Drawing: I will be green
Dken2021: you know that's not true.
As soon as you get used to the amount of sex spam we have, you'll come to like britian quite a bit
13who will continue to vote them in because they don't know better
Would any British bronies mind if I just randomly showed up at your flat and stayed for about a week?
Airpuff|Drawing: Eh, I'll be the Rainbow Dash colors.
not sure why you would move to another country, the locals will hate you too
Any diablo 3 gamers? Feel free to add me, Thendris#2436 on european servers :)
Shizuka can be purple, and Nittany_Discord can be blue!
Omg guys xD
Luna_of_Assassins: It's not a flat but it does have a large couch. Also several cats and a dog.
GilDash: You there?
Airpuff|Drawing: i believe gil is away right now, sorry, lol
13color?
Sylandest: .. meh >.<
11,01CISPA hasn't passed the Senate yet.
Airpuff|Drawing: Last I heard it was buisy.
Meanwhile: I'll bring my alergy meds for the cats.
Luna_of_Assassins: I wouldn't mind, but wouldn't really have room
Shizuka: yeah making GilDash 's OC
Airpuff|Drawing: Is anything wrong with my color choice?
I like cats though
Well, internet freedom needs to become more of a hot-button issue.
Shizuka: Someone asked what colors we should be
lol
Airpuff|Drawing: went to go get food, i believe. should be back in a few minutes or so
/me 13is between pink and red
Sylandest: kk.
11,01Since no tech companies are against it, I don't see an internet blackout coming from CISPA's possible passing.
Shizuka: hmpf.. so you think i should make it something between that then?
13for what
So you're sore Shizuka?
Gah, all this talk of us British is making me luster for a nice cuppatea
We should be urging the tech companies to oppose this. We are their users.
I want more wenches More wenches and mead Lots of wenches is what I need
11,01Best thing to do is to vote out the bill supporters.
Honestly I don't think you guys should be overly worried about these things
I must say Pizza I am eating is simple marvolis. I must get more of it, BUT WHERE!?
11,01Shizuka is light red.
I think I'd do all the things they do on the YogPod. I'd eat jaffa cakes while listening to Tina Barret.
/me 13is medium rare
Then I'd watch Bryan Blessed
/me 11,01wants pizza
Nittany_Discord, I'd hope non-commercial sites like wikipedia would speak up against it at least
what pizza is it |Discord|
>.>
Luna_of_Assassins: Are the Yogscast bronies?
alexxm: Hawaiin
I could go for a good panini right now
I think Simon is. They did do Sunshine of Israpony
Also Hannah might be
11,01So ham and pineapple?
Shizuka: when were you cooked?
Luna_of_Assassins: Well what title does that make fun of?
I'm making tacos for dinner! In b4 everypony jelly
Nittany_Discord: Yep
Shadow of Israphel?
13was burned years ago
i heard firefox is against CISPA
11,01/)
|Discord| delicious! <3
Nittany_Discord: \(
Well DoublePint and I are off its a nice day and we have plans to make!!!
ops
11,01I love pineapple on my pizza.
Nittany_Discord: (\
Nittany_Discord: I do to
Blaegh, pinaples *dies*
11,01I usually get pepperoni and pineapple.
There's one Senator from my state who is DEFINITELY part of the problem. But he's not going to be up for reelection until 2014.
Eww pineapple
Very_Silly_Filly: I agree with you. And I live here -_-
Very_Silly_Filly: We have the most nuclear weapons and the largest military. Basically that unfortunatly gives us license to do whatever we weant.
0,5I like bacon on my pizza
Shizuka...so that makes you cooked?.......
0,5and barbeque sauce
0,5and pineapple
Um..well. I have Fluttershy.
0,5mmmmmm
Actually one quick bragging point before DerpStar steals my laptop
11,01I hope Pat Toomey goes next election cycle.
Nittany_Discord: Dont think I am gross or anything...but i like chocolate and bananas on my pizza
had barbeque pizza once, it was awful
LordCelestia: dude, wat?
yum
Very_Silly_Filly: Please fire.
11,01I should try that.
0,5Its a Hawaaian pizza
11,01Sounds good.
I got to see Anthology II :D
IT IZ
Yay
I like 2 chickens and a dictionary to go with my pizza
/me fires the Fluttershy cannon
DoublePint it's out now?
Nittany_Discord: It's just another guy to bribe.
YEah he won't shut up about that
LordCelestia: last time i checked hawaiian pizza didnt have barbecue sace
LordCelestia: Is it still hawaain if you put chocolate on it?
is it out yet DoublePint
11,01But possibly less.
i heard firefox is against CISPA
No Dken2021 early screening at the con I went
Dark_Horst iirc, the ones at dominoes do
At the same time, we need to make it clear that piracy isn't harming the entertainment industry. And we also need to make it clear that the anti-piracy IS harming our freedoms.
Firefox is made by people
And DerpStar stayed home :p
11,01Letting senators and rep who supported internet censorship bills stay in office is wrong.
they would be
Dark_Horst no wait, papa john's
DoublePint lucky you :\
11,01Papa Johns is good, but expensive.
Und then chat was a whole bunch of stuff about internet censorship and whatnot.
was it good DoublePint
Also pizza. Apparently.
How old does one have to be to run for Senate?
/me 11,01dust Meanwhile
Dken2021: who ARE those people.... also i think it should be ham. not bacon.i thinkz
Ah, got to work on my story everypony, see you all later.:)(
Welp I am off. But before I go does anyone here know of a good resturant around Denver that is affordable and fun?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.

Irish_Pony: You know I couldn't kill anypony... intentionally. :D
Shimmer but he doesn't have tentacles now squidward on the other other hand

GilDash: Why not! It would be fun to watch.
GilDash: How do you know you already havent? ;)
11,01But I've had a strange person contact me before. Got up to stalker-level creepiness.

Oh snap

Irish_Pony why is thre a pony butlerbot?
So DRF, the main IT guy at my school hates Windows 8 as much as you do:P
i always wondered what made the slender man scary as all hell
Dken2021: Because the guy who created him can do what he wants?
dag;bjda
inded
SO WHO ELSE SAW THAT LYRA PLUSH?
i mean who would have thought that putting a tall man in a suit in the background of photos and videos = nightmare fuel
03Nice
14last computer class I realized I'm an hipster
14"hey, what's the "Austrumi" folder you have in your usb?"

Shamroc - I'm up for a game
whats the context of that Golakka
I couldnt even go on hotmail in school
CCCP: the question is, why would you want to?
Golakka: ummm
it was considered "unsafe"
hey you guys game for some l4d2?
/me cleans his M14
alexxm, I think its one of the saints, can't remember which one
ingwaz: cause its funny (but that is a very valid point)
oh wow
That lyra plushie, theres a post about it
"those dead, lifeless eyes... she knows what her fate is"
thanks RainbowAsh
Add "Luna's Creed" on steam
CCCP: its funny like dead baby jokes are funny
We'll kick some zombie plot
hows your day been RainbowAsh
eh why not
Golakka redeem her
Shimmer: That's a very nice wallpaper I have now
:D
ingwaz: people are too mean to poor old 4chan
ow...i just popped not only my neck, but my chest...that was kind of painful
I'd rather Luna or Fluttershy, but still
how'd you do that ingwaz
Luna_of_Assassins: Request one from the artist, maybe he'll be nice
ingwaz: Yeah, I've done that. It really does hurt doesn't it. :D
Gabby_Gums: Fuck off
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMWi7CLoZ2Q
CCCP: some boards might be alright on 4chan, but for the most part, its something i'd rather not deal with
alexxm, ok so far. As good as completely back to health. Good thing too, because there is a lot of work wating for me during the next few days.
is it a good or a bad thing that i never visited 4chan?
Gabby_Gums: fists cats
It's possible
alexxm: being much taller than average, pretty much every bone in my body pops, including i believe my ribcage
I will hug you Golakka
Bollocks I need to do my Altair Applejack
Being in a skype call with Gabby_Gums is funny, i can hear every ping
ingwaz: yeah i guess
Its like sonar with Gabby_Gums

Golakka: you are a person with feet
Meanwhile: you game?
In fact i LOVE being alone
Im atually a unicorn with jazz hands
CCCP: i went on 4chan a few times a long time ago, it may be a place where you can gather information, but their rules of conduct and how they interact with each other simply does not sit well with me
Right, being gone for a mimmet now apparently equates to "I'm ahving you shipped to Norway to work with sled dogs for a few weeks in the summer."

What song am I whistleing...
Hey everypony! I'm back!

CCCP: simply because something got its first start internet wise in 4chan, doesnt mean i have to like 4chan. good things can come out of a terrible place. it doesnt make the terrible place any better or the good things any worse
i'm sorry to say this but that plushie Golakka showed us is why people think we are freaks
|Discord|, no stream is on, so it should be ok if it's sfw

Irish_Pony: Briliant, we shall call you I got nothing.
Om: It's not the spelling I'm laughing at ;)
Homework was created by the Government to make it seem like it would make you smarter, but in reality it showly kills away your Brain Cells...FOREVER...
Let me explain, when I become a game desigener, I will put TONS of brony easter eggs in my game.
Om And ill call you Mr. Fucking Coward
If Twi hadn't studied, she wouldn't be in ponyville and MLP wouldn't happen. Studying is important.
