Bits are 4 binary numbers

terarria
I've had a 5 disc BG edition too
00,02i must figure why ffmpeg does that
f that
*Cough*
playstations 3 sucks because it only have half a gig
Playstation is consoles...
00,02its more of a memory problem
xbox 360 have 3 gigs
http://bit.ly/rLXUc0
00,02the ps3 had a bizare memory layout
Damimt
Wrong one
When is graphics GOING too good while gameplay goes lower. =/
http://bit.ly/KmGve0 <-- right one
I'd say it's a processor problem too
00,02not realy
00,02ps3 has a fairly powerfull processor
:\
at 40 fps with 16 gigs
OBJECTION
Why are we talking about consoles..
Prototype...MY WORST ENEMY
ps3 had 1 gig of ram
loooooool
PS3 CPU is more like a GPU
00,02bandwidth problems
ohhhh dat babe
the cpu is the gpu!
bom chica wow wow
00,02plus audio memory is in a strange place too
But it kinda fails in gameplay
*technology
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the mapping is, but theres not enough memory for most engines
audio on ps3 suck i cant use my 3 k bose system
00,02Vordox, i saw a thing that claimed to be the tech specs for the ps4
00,02it claimed some epic large numbers
my problem wasn't the graphics I really didn't care about
00,02similar memory setup
00,02but 10GB instead of 256MB
and got 10 hours of gameplay
00,02plus the thing looks like a damned supercomputer
00,02256 SPU's, compared to the 7 in the ps3
00,02but this is all rumor, not sure of anything
you thik it won't sell?
00,02the cpu was allso somewhat a hinderance for cross platform, but i blame that on lazy programers
And here is where console contracting begin
my laptop is 8 time faster than an xbox 360 and a 360 is 300$ my alptop was 800$
the reason why ps3 got rid of backward compatibility
00,02ps3 got rid of it due to cost
is because they need 4 cd drives
00,02it had the ps2 hardware in it
you can emulate offical games
cant
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, no idea, more than i can afford thats for sure
Even back as PSX?!?!?!
1099 UD-Dollars!
00,02Vordox, yes
lol, Live_Essence
now imageion backwards for ps3 ps 2ps1 psx ps 4cd and blu rays
!!!!
00,02they probably just wrote emulators
>.<
00,02heck, ps1 and 2 emulators already exist
yes but a legit disk is required
00,02to make emulators?
00,02probably not
ps2 ones aren't very good though
legit disk dont emulate
00,02its cpu is compatible with the ps3, and they had most of a ps2 emulator already
It may be cheap, but the amount of selling is past millions of dollars.
yes they are
All i say, the best machiene when it comes to multiplayer games: N64.
xD
no because starwars shutdown the server last year
00,02and with the ammount of power they have, being lazy with the ps1 emulators performance is acceptible
That 2Sided Television is a great addition to gaming
00,02anyone want to see a talk about the ps3's security system?
i got a joke two person walk in a bar i forgot the rest
00,02pree
00,02pre'
00,02i think
Sure. :P
meh why not
I'm feeling lazy and ignorant
00,02the ps3 security
mabey even SEXTILIONS
FAIL OVERFLOW
very fitting
00,02hence homebrew channel
00,02Life_Essence, the ammount of fail in the ps3's security is huge
a fucker maker kills 50 million dalars
00,02alexxm, a way to run homebrew on the wii
00,02sry about the volume
00,02its that way on my copy too
50 million by a craona ONE CRAOLA
I think i'll try to put Homebrew channel on my wii when i get the wiiU and play all my Wii games on there
00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, ps3's security system
xbox was ok
00,02you cant run homebrew on the 360, but you can run pirated games
00,02little strange
00,02yeah, they screwed up bad with the 360's hardware
>.<
yeah byt the rrod could be fixed easy
i fixed the rro xon a 2005 xbox
rrod
lie*
that 2005 xbox is still working to this day

the goverment says one you but it you have full rights
00,02Vordox, they own the device
Cause they are chinese
thats how i can jailbreak my iphone leagly

Implying jailbreaking is illegal
Which it isn't
Here at least
achivement unlocked: become a hack nerd
00,02Vordox, because they own the device

00,02too many loaders
i can survive on a diet composed entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
I would probably only use it to play PS1 games from the store, and PS2 games that I have. I'm down right horrible at playing FPS games on consoles.
it*
ps3 is okay
Only the very first few models did that, most of the later ones no longer had the backwards compatibility.
I have one of the very first models. *smug*
00,02the ps3's with 'emotion engines' are rare and expencive
I like my PS3, but I accidentally broke my backwards compatible one >_>
00,02XAX, the ps2's cpu
I don't care about the medium, gimme games.
00,02now this right here is epic fail
Oh no no no, not going into a "best platform" discussion.
I CAN SURVIVE ON A DIET OF CRayons and lighter fluid
Each platform has its merits and demerits.
Oh good grief.
oh plese i can surrvive a diet of hot pockets
00,02that line of code is a high-school i learnt on basic mistake
Any questions?
00,02XAX, not without the hardware or an emulator
Right
00,02this bit
Admittedly, squealing about how hard the PS3 failed now is a bit behind the curve, if I'm honest.
00,02is epic fail
Yeah, they screwed up. Oh deary me.
00,02Bromany, lighter fluid is probably toxic
Are there games on my PS3 that I like? Yes? Okay, I'll go play those games then.
huh ?

Anyway, my version is 1.4.5.3, which lags horribly. I'm going to take my chances with the latest version I can find. It might take some jury rigging on my part. This could take all afternoon.
