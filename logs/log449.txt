WallDives: Hello! That would probably be me. :D
I am Back baby
TrixieMuffin: :D
Lil_B: I like it! It has a light tune to it, very enjoyable
whois streaming
/me shrugs
Wrek
Well, since I'm here, I'll share a dream I had last night. Part of it was me on Bronystate, and we were watching Code Lyoko. Maybe someone will actually stream that show someday?
uh some guy mesaged me an told me to say, GilDash|EqD loves lazers?
pony_4573: Sorry about that. =_=
Lazahs?
Why?
OM! YOU ARE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE!
Serj?
Marx: we streamed Code Lyoko yesterday
:O
Sylandest1 thanks, I like the piano, but right now i can't really do piano pieces because 100% of my inspirration comes from just playing it and so far i have no way to transfer this to the PC
Ahh, good ol
Good ol' Fresh Meat
SirGanjalf the Brave
I used to be able to play the piano, a little. Kinda want to again.
Good ol Fresh Prince
Lil_B: That's fine, no worries. Do you have any sort of media recording program or sound program?
Sir Garrett the Brony:P
That's the crazy thing about my dreams. Sometimes they show me a thing or two, and then one day it actually happens.
Marx: do you have pinkie sense?
What game is this?
Marx: I know what you mean. I get deja vu from my dreams sometime too. :)
GarrettBrony: D3.
Looks to dark to be D3
Idk. I could. I think there was one dream I had where I saw the Gamecube logo even though it was a few years before the system actually came out.
It was a long time ago, but yeah.
Sylandest1 no, i hope i can get a MIDI keyboard soo, that would actual composing way easyer then clicking each not, and trying to get the right lenght and nots
GilDash|EqD: I get deja vu all the time when I'm out. I see something, walk by it, then come back and say "I've seen this before"
Game looks good
Welp, gotta go. Later guys.
Bye Marx.
Lil_B: It sounds like you have a plan then! Work towards that so you can play more and make more good pieces like what you gave me! You will surely succeed :)
i had a dream that Princess Celestia and Luna were in middle school and they were uneasy about their new found fame
dat jump
I dont think I've dreamed about ponies.
http://derpy.me/6CRoG
Sylandest1: Not like that. It's like a split second in time, sometimes a few seconds. I had one with Bronystate a few days ago, and everything seemed to match, right down to the text and the video playing.
...?
Lazah
Why? Why is Ommy trolling me? :'(
I dont get it.
Bai Lugia :u
Sylandest1 hopefully, right now all i can do is not to stop or to let myself down. Only a fool would think that success is imidient
praise your pony overlords lol
GilDash|EqD: oh really? That's a pretty strong occurance
GilDash|EqD: Wat about SonicRainbooms
GarrettBrony: Wait, what?
/me SonicRainbooms
precognitive dreams?
GarrettBrony: That's not how it works. :$
Lil_B: success is not always immediate, true. But it can be achieved if you keep trying. If you have the will to continue and persevere, then success will be found regardless of the length of time needed
good evening everypony
WallDives: I'd say so, but then I'd think I was mad. :D
05well that was fun
Scavender: Holla! :)

GilDash: goodness, lol. I always stay up to date on such things
Sylandest1: I've been out of it lately. :$
/me sits on Omlazerlicous's head.
I agree. That Spitfire turned out fantastically
/me doesn't want to talk about stupid sexy Spitfire.
This isn't an RP chat you know~
GilDash: I'm quite aware of that, lol. And I can imagine several reasons why *notes the spitfire comment*
/me stares shocked at GilDash "Thats rare" =O
Omlazerlicous: Don't backseat mod~
EQD... right that sites does still exist... I need to read/ignore some articles right now
Airpuff: I'm not sure what would happen if I did...
GilDash: Thats more like it.. xD
WallDives, GilDash: I have a ton of work to do, my car is out of gas, my fridge is out of groceries, my copy of Illustrator doesn't work anymore because my boss decided it would be fun to install it even though he can't use it and I need it for homework, and I have a ginormous project I need to put my nose to the grindstone for for a week :'(
GilDash: Just passing down the law of RB64
Aylnine: ouch. You do have a rough week ahead, huh?
Aylnine: aaah... so much work..
Sylandest1: Yup T^T
Omlazerlicous: Your spelling is getting worse and worse Ommy. Soon you'll spell no as yes and I'll get all confused. ;)
Aylnine: Wow. That sucks ass.
Aylnine: I see. that is a rough week ahead. I sympathize, this week will be hell for me too...
/me hugs Aylnine.
Acleps: What are you doing here?
Thanks all ^^
!ping
!pong
!pong
Aylnine: we got your back. We'll keep your morale up! :)
!lag
oka
Acleps: How come you haven't said anything?
GilDash: Let me know when you get all confused and I'll mix it up for ya. Eh?
Aylnine: .... just imagine the feeling when you are done with it! :D
Yeah :D
Omlazerlicous: You might not get out of that alive. ;)
I wub all of you
GilDash: I came here for no reason...
Just collapse and Die of enjoyment xD
Aylnine: Well, you could stop talking to us and get started... :)
GilDash: I have lazers I am invincible.
GilDash: I ddin't really feel like talking :/
Acleps: Tsk tsk, not even to me? ;)
Acleps: Hey, say lazers please?
Doing it as we speak GilDash XD
!dingdong
Time to watch my favorite show Season 1 of The Buffering Circle!
Omlazerlicous: I can deflect lazers easily. Lasers on the other hand...
Aylnine: Good. And good luck. :)
GIlDash: I wasn't sure what I should say
Acleps: Hiya GilDash? :D
Omlazerlicious: Lazers
/me hugs Acleps.
Thanks GilDash
GilDash: What does lazers stand for anyways? o.o
Acleps: Please, don't encourage him. :|
You underestimate the power of lazers GilDash
I think Drawfriedn is the only reason anymore why i visit EQD
LilB: I know, its always so enjoyable to see
GilDash: That could work
GilDash: ._. But...
Acleps: Thank you very much.
Omlazerlicous: You underestimate me, Om. You've no idea what I can be like...
GilDash: Aye, that is true. And yet. The lazerz, they call to me.
Acleps: What could work?
GilDash: now now, let's not be hasty! :$
GilDash: ... If its... Lazer... why is .. it dosent fit with Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation? xD
Omlazerlicous: Well, I'll be calling to you if you're not careful. ;)
GilDash: Saying "Hiya GilDash!"
Airpuff: Exactly. That's why it's laser.
!ping
!pong
"Everyday i'm lazerin"
Acleps: There you go then. You're going to get a response from me. :D
GilDash: I have my eyepatches and earplugs ready and at hand.
GilDash: So some people trolling.. or they just dont know that its s? XD
!lag
Omlazerlicous: Good. You won't be able to stop the gag and binds then. ;)
GilDash: I'm not even sure why I came here tho... That's why I ddin't say anything
Airpuff: Ommy is being mean to me. :(
GilDash: Really? xD
What have you said now Om? =O
Acleps: We could always do something... ;)
With lazers, GilDash One true weakness
Omlazerlicous: ... its laser..
So how about that game of thrones
Omlazerlicous: These are made of crystal, Ommy. They reflect lazers so well. ;)
The guy who streams that is gone
GilDash: Something?... I'm listening...
Acleps: Oh... you know... ;)
GilDash: No, not really :S
GilDash: Crystals channel lasers, not lazers. You said it yourself. They arent the same~
You'know Acleps .. blowing up balloons..... throwing darts.. the normal! xD
Seaponies~
GilDash: *faceplant*
Airpuff: Nothing at all.
Airpuff: Sounds like normal :)
Omlazerlicous: These are special crystals. I managed to get them on discount from Rarity. Now, that was *one* hard discount to work for, but it was worth it. :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKyu0NlnnWQ
Sylandest1: What's up with you? :D
hi everypony
GilDash: You go though far to much expence. For lazers
GilDash: nothing...just observing that you're the same as ever and my brain is as dirty as it ever is...XD
Omlazerlicous: ... there is nothing named lazers.....
Airpuff: Then it shouldn't bother you eh?
!pokemon
Omlazerlicous: i think there's a japaneese videogame which spelled it wrong.. but thats it xD

GilDash: apparently so. you have mastered it, lol
GilDash: ... dat charm

Sylandest1: Well, I've still some ways to go... but I'm always willing to learn. ;)
GilDash: Learn from lazers.
Sylandest1: Maybe you could teach me? ;)
03it's hot as an oven in here x.x
Omlazerlicous: There will be chains involved! :)
GilDash: :$ I'm not a good teacher, ehehe
!pokemon
bluesun, you are a 12Natu.
/me steps back a few feet
Stream done?
GilDash: Chains, I am imune to them.
Sylandest1: Well, you'll make for a good student then. And any good teacher can always pick up a few new things from a student. ;)
Sylandest1: Run! I'll keep it distracted!
Omlazerlicous: Not the ones I use. :)
I had to step away for a second, whats about chains and lasers?
I will be back later
Omlazerlicous: and how would you distract gil? lol
WallDives: You know, the usual. ;)
actually, wait, I dont want to know anymore.

Sylandest1: With lazers
GilDash: Well, I always was told I did good in class...though I'm not sure I would be safe taking yours...lol
WallDives: I've got diagrams if you want them. :)

GilDash: My lazer power is forever
Omlazerlicous: well, that could work
Sylandest1: It's perfectly safe. Perfectly enjoyable too, I've been told... ;)
GilDash: have you any previous er...students I could ask? :$
Sylandest1: All were satisfied. ;)
Sylandest1: Don't ask run!
!pokemon
I should really be practicing, but I dont want to...
Omlazerlicous: But I can't run! It's my day off! Running is contrary to the idea of being off!
GilDash: um...er...meep?
WallDives: Come practice with me! :)
Oh, and for the record. Din, and pony_4573 were both me~
GilDash: silly, you dont play fighting games.
Sylandest1: It's a free demonstration. ;)
Omlazerlicous: I actually knew that.

I love WoW...
FlareChaserxOctavia: I can't get my installation to work! ;(
Dear princess celestia I am so alone :)
WallDives: I did not think it would escape everyone
Sylandest1: :(
Who doesn't love WoW?
I dont.
Me!

'Cause I don't. :p
That's enought of that.
GilDash: well, free does have its advantages...but I think I will pass for now...:$

GarrettBrony: What is it :O?
Phase4: ha, grannysmith.
Hello everypony.
Phase4: Night night. :)
Airpuff: I don't even know what that means.
13How difficult is it to find a PS3 with backwards compatibility these days?
hi pyrocatboy.
hai pyrocatboy
03very
03well
Airpuff: O//O wh-why did you? Never mind *scoots away*
03it's not only that
hai pyrocatboy !
hey pyrocatboy hows your day been
03but it has to be older firmware so I can hack it
03there are only two on all of eBay that even fit that :|
alexxm : meh
03as in, first generation (so it plays PS2 games) + not updated
Om: oh yes you do. :)
Hi pyrocatboy! :)
03EVERYBODY UPDATES THEIR PS3s :|
Sylandest1: Are you new here by chance?
taking the mick out of old movies Acleps
03fricking ruins the value
GilDash: Explicit is 18+ nonexplicit is mature. PG is NEITHER.
Acleps: let this video explain http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcUkKltAidM
Airpuff: I don't.
Whats streaming
03but if you don't care about hacking and playing free games, there are a few first-gen ones out there yeah
the buffering cirlce
13Yeah, cuz I know someone who's looking for a backwards compatible PS3 and he seems pretty determined to find one
*cirlce
eh
03how much would he pay
/me runs
GilDash: seriously people have been permabanned for that kind of stuff.
Dermathil: Depends on the terminology used. I've seen more than a few raunchy things in PG films. :)
03No I'm serious, I have a spare
13even though I warned him it's be difficult to find one xD
03well "spare"
13*it'd
xD Om, sometimes.. youre just awkwardly dumb. Cute ;)
Om: nay, been here a little while. I'm aware of the rules
03basically I was stupid and accidentally updated it
03so no hacks
03:/
Ohai everypony
13how much would you sell it for :P
hai Jim
03around $200
Dermathil: 'Sides that, I'm silent when a mod instructs it.
Hai Jim !
hi Jim.
03that's what I just paid for the new one
GilDash, I know the terminology used on Bronystate. And for the chat SAUCY is NOT OKAY
hey Jim hows your day been
hes dead Jiim
Sylandest1: Its not the rules I am woried about. You see, they don't know when to stop.
03well "new", you get the idea XD
My day's been pretty alright
Airpuff: Don't call me that.
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/675/batman-credit-card1.jpg
/me gives Dermathil a chillpill
Dermathil: If we're going to discuss the rules, then don't backseat mod. :p
Om: Owkai then :)
BAT CREDIT CARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDD
Om: oh, that. I'm aware of that, lol. I've seen GilDash at it before
13well he's been on a games/consoles spending spree lately and won't listen to me when I say he should SAVE the money
13so that price is probably fine xD
GarrettBrony: Where?!
/me gives GilDash some carrot juice.
GilDash: then start acting accordingly.
Om: Yeah. I know when to stop. Just as the mod hovers a finger over the kick button... :D
GarrettBrony: I'm more confused than ever :S
pyrocatboy:i want that credit card
GilDash: That works fine. xD
03but I'm assuming he's in the UK?
GilDash: and even then, you hardly lose motivation...lol
Sylandest1: Right, have fun then.
Somepony Linked to a Picture of a bat credit card
You don't know when to really stop.
13Yes :P
13> Paypal
03ah
03well
Sylandest1: Well, I just keep it on the back-burner. ;)
GilDash: Yes, that is when you stop >.>
03I don't know if PS3 games are region protected
03but mine's a USA console
in this chat
03if that means anything
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-feel-the-power-of-love-and-tolerance.jpg
This game is just so great http://derpy.me/Qa6OB
Om: Just. It's still there in my head when things calm down though. ;)
So, did Val stream anything good after the mindrape last night?
well
pyocatboy: :D
PS3 games aren't, PS1/2 games are
03are they?
Kandarihu: am I the only one who thought that audio screw ups were hilarious?
In the not to distant future next sunday A.D
nope :\
03ah
03so it would basically defeat the point of backwards compatibility LOL
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo1_500.png
GilDash: well, at least cherry is here to keep you under control...for the most part...lol
13apparently PS3 games are region free
well he could always import :p
GilDash: With so little in the chat today, I worry for the sanity of others and myself
03that's what bluesun just said
03well yeah, but that seems dumb
13what I've always wanted to know is WHY WOULD THEY GET RID OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY TO BEGIN WITH
dat fluttershy pyrocatboy :3
03because they're SOny
03and they're idiots.
03that, and money
Damn pyrocatboy thats adorable *-*
La La LA
03now, why did they get rid of the emulation that second-gen PS3s had? No idea, probably because they're idiots
Mitchell!
03but the first-gen ones actually cost a crap ton of money to make xD
Om you're always worried about your sanity :P
Airpuff: It slips far to easily.
Avenger r u toxic
Sanity is overrated...and insanity is boring.
apparently when they abandoned it they had something like 500+ PS2 games that needed to be Special Cased for the PS3 and even more being discovered as time went on
Welcome to Bronystate, please leave your sanity at hte designated sanity disposal containers at the doors.
the*
Om: maybe i can massage it back into you? ;)
03er wait
03special cased?
I like to call it Mental Entertainment
Airpuff: GilDash has rubbed off on you...lol
different internal emulator options
Sylandest1: i know.. xD
03ah
Airpuff: Or, you can do nothing and let it teeter like it should.
03that only applies to the second-gen ones then, right?
Om: what if you loose your sanity then?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo2_500.png

Om i would have no one to punish me if i go too far ;)

Airpuff: We taling real or hypothetical >.>

GilDash: Hellooo? *waves hoof in front of GilDash's eyes*

03I don't quite get why they named the hardware emulator "emotion engine" :P
03makes it sound fancier than it actually is XD
CrazyCherry: perhaps Gil is rebooting?

pyrocatboy: Hnnnnngggh

WallDives: Yes. He got 30 days in prison for what he did.
WallDives: You can be charged with asisted suicide I think
Hi, Goodafternoon everyone
Om: that depends per state. coersion to suicide isnt a charge in many states...
Hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Om: That's not technically assisted suicide though.
its harrassment at wost, sadly.
worst^
Om http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lygzpdR9zq1qigx3ro1_500.jpg
GilDash: True, I was just sayin.
Why did you link that to me.
I just thought it was ridiculous how he got away with it.
Why not?
Because it's cool`?
Om Because i felt like it
Link some to me to!
Fair enough.
btw, the charges were for invasion of privacy.
which is a misdemeanor, iirc.
Mods are away, post humans.
lul
the problem is, at the end of the day, suicide is still a choice you do to yourself.

Princess_Molestia: Think you can handle another? ;)
GilDash:...(just wants to ping you)
03but I think most people would still consider you a pedo if they're "minors", or under 18
MORE ORGY GilDash of course
This is getting weird real fast...
/me flies off.
wow, and to think this is PG.
hey kids
I guess it's true. Twilight Sparkle's cutie mark DOES have 42 points on it.
/me glomps Litwick
play with her arse GilDash
Tbh I'm saying 16 for now because generally people shouldn't be dating below that age anyway, otherwise lol preteens
Princess_Molestia: what about me
Sylandest: Nah, just in a debate and taking any opportunity. ;)
Guys, I got something to say:
ahem
05you wouldnt even last the first 4 hours molestia
GilDash: what is being debated?
WallDives: Almost never I'm affraid.
they're immature anyway
alexxm: Thanks for the advice. ;)
I'm not against roleplay but there are kids here guys.
I read Molestia.
Wrek: is that a test?
I was wondering where that noise was coming from *closes BS window*
Kandarihu: Does that mean that Twilight Sparkle is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?
hey FlareChaser what have you been up to
03some older people are immature
/me runs
12pretty much
all the orgy omg ö_ö
alexxm: nothing :3
and above my age, I'd say 22 or so
I read ALLLLL of Molestia.
Sylandest: Fricking quantum physics and philosophy. -_-
05no its a cup of tea :3
it was...eh.
TRUST ME MOLESTIA. YOU DON'T WANT WREK.
02[I am 0321.166133 02years old]
03OK cool
Wrek: dat be challenge? cause i like a good challenge!
03I mean
03hi
Malavolent: ....kids are not as innocent as u think.
:D
Ofc my parents wouldn't like that
GilDash: The best stuff eva!
GilDash: I would never expect that, lol. I've got nothing to contribute there
Magical_pablez94: Noone is.
Molestia x Wrek? what?
MI MOM!
FlareChaser: Me Too
/me kisses Wrek
They would want someone no older than one or two years
Sylandest: It's sooo boring... >_<
12Holy carp it just struck me I'm 20 this year
um Princess_Molestia Wrek s heart belongs to twilight
Sylandest: Its hurts GilDash wittle mind
I have no.idea their stance on someone younger than me
hihi
03you remind me of a bash quote Soital
03I'll say in PM :P
Soital ur old DDDDDDDDDDD:
FlareChaser: eeyep... are they so cuute~??
I'm not about to ask
GilDash: lol, then stop debating it and do something fun! :)
Sylandest: Yet I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame.
:P
Bronysith: she can get in on it too
Sylandest: Is that an offer? ;)
12I don't look 20 ;__;
Shizuka, are you up for playing a game or something? :3
13i am making a song~
FlareChaser: aren't*
It's just an homage to the franchise. In the canon of the book, 42 wasn't REALLY the meaning to Life, the Universe and Everything. It's just a pointless response Deep Thought conjured up after 7,000,000 years of waiting for the perfect question.
:o
/me paints blue everywhere
hey Shizuka whats up
Epic, Shizuka. :3
That's cool
12I wonder if I could get away with going in wacky warehouse
I look 20
I BROKE THE RULES
DJ
12I missed that play area
GilDash: O///O w-what? no!
D:
/me kisses Sylandest.
13well sort of making a song... more like remaking the piano song from the new intermission so it's higher quality
Litwick: you should be punished... prepare it
Sylandest: Not so fun is it?
:3
Sylandest: Yes it was. ;)
03LOL really?
How about no Princess_Molestia.
/me blushes red as fire
That reminds me
New intermission?
Litwick: too bad
whats Wreky drawing now? :P
Om: I was just trying to help...XD
Wrek, continuing oin yur Spitfire Challenge?
guys, seriously, RPing is against the rules. Take it to another room or to a PM >_>
I picked up a job application the other day
You all look the same to me
The lady was like
D:
"Aren't you a little old to work here?"
12except I have a cow on my head
12a chibi cow
Sylandest: GilDash doesn't need help. Words of advice.
Rain: The mods can handle themselves. :)
12named Moo
I said I was only.17
03pix or gtfo?
03XD
Rain: What do you know, maybe it's happening for real? In that case it's not against the rules.
Om: duly noted...lol
12=o
Soicow
/me hides

Biglaw: It is about your life, or it's just inspired by it?
FlareChaser: as a doctor (I am not a doctor) I believe that the most effective cure for any case of sever boredom is 10 ccs of video games. Can't measure video games in ccs? Well, just keep playing until that pesky boredom clears up.
I'm about to fall asleep because of tiredness....

FlareChaser I just want a break today. Sorry for outbursting.

sharklion: I suppose. Of course, we ARE an international force so they wouldnt know WHO was invading.
we even got Wrek getting flown over as a guest of honour
wait here a minute
hey OmegaMetroidBrony hows your day been
/me hugwubbles OmegaMetroidBrony back :3
alexxm, long and exhausting, but a mug of soy milk with maple sirup just now made it all good again. ^^
force? invading?
Kriel_Pony: news just in. Every country invades Poland
05and ofc my darkest days to make this image as uncomfortable as possiboru
Invi: if physical laws existed, then how do you explain the lifetime muffins I just won hmmm?:P
CrimsonPhoenix http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship
Good alexxm nearly aquired severe injury
You?
Wrek: llove My Darkest Days, thanks for introducing me to them
CrimsonPhoenix: Wow. That makes TOO much sense
Wrek: well... nothing makes me uncomfortable ^^
Wrek, I love it when you make things uncomfortable :3
how OmegaMetroidBrony i'm good did some filming today
Rain: thats what she said
sharklion: Thats my point. Everyone invades poland, but poland is still it's own country, so none of them WIN
Invi, why shouldn't physical laws exist?
RainbowAsh because you can't prof them really, because prooving things 100% isn't possible
*proof
hello everypony
hio CCCP
RainbowAsh: because I just won a lifetime of something by being the 999,999th visitor
Oh hai CCCP
hey CCCP hows your day been
hi CCCP.
Kriel_Pony: It's becasue Poland trancends all laws of war and wins no matter what happens. Also, it's a miniscule amount of Poland. Everyone in the chat could invade Poland.
hi Invi OmegaMetroidBrony alexxm and WallDives
hi CCCP
CCCP http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn for Brony
RainbowAsh and DAN is a counterexample for physical laws
alexxm: its been good, you?
Dan: Congratulations, that's awesome.
Hello sexy people
hi sharklion
good CCCP done some filming today
Oh hai Golakka
sharklion: Why don't we just start our OWN crappy village and CALL it Brony?
sup Golakka
alexxm: LOL
whats wrekky up to today? who is he drawing?
hey Golakka hows your day been
Also, we can prove some things 100%
alexxm: filmimg what?

Gollakka http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn
a movie for my college course CCCP
but there are only 2 ways to prove something 100%
Kriel_Pony: That requires more work! we have to all buy materials and stuff. It's easier to go to poland and take over with sheer power of men with sticks
either mathematically or by logical necessity
Dan no, there is no way
god i love being ComSci http://imgur.com/lwWeu
alexxm: cool :) whats it about?
hi Golakka
why is always us alexxm who start the wars?
sharklion: But, I think if we took the town, the rest of poland may take offense.
quad 1080p monitors :D
Invi, that implies a very restrictive definition of "proof". Also prooving laws is not how science works, they gather evidence and seek counter-examples in order to make a case for or against a hypothesis.
a stalker CCCP
/me glomps invi
/me sexes cccp non sexually
what sharklion
Golakka: :3
Kriel_Pony: we could all move in slowly. then, one day, everyone there would be a brony
Invi: yes :) for example, 2 + 2 will always equal 4
Golakka http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn
alexxm: cool, lol
You Jelly? http://imgur.com/lwWeu
lol middle of nowhere much
it's a necessary mathematical conclusion
alexxm: we always start the wars on small places for equestria! :D
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!!
Kriel_Pony: the peaceful way to remove people from their homes
what do we do with the 80 people already there sharklion
Dan RainbowAsh there are only 2 things that are sure, the rest can be made up (like in Matrix) or not :3
alexxm: We play MLP all day. They will convert or flee.
what 2 things, Invi
?
or shut electricity off to the village.
so we weaponize G3 Kriel_Pony
alexxm: Basically. psychological warfare.
hey alexxm, ping meh if you need meh XD
I am currently using 6 monitors :S
Dan cogito ergo sum and the anthropical principle
FINALLY!
is wrek drawing trixie in compromising positions again?

Golakka: No, Lotus
Golakka no i guess it's a spa pony
Lotus?
blarggg
that was bad
0,5O__O
AH! i see it now
spapony
Invi, a lot of the rest can be observed though, and from these observations theories and laws can be produced that are steps on the way to understand the world a bit better.
damnit TF2 crashed again..
alexxm: oh shit.... it exists
Cinnamon/Linux desktop manager kept crashing on me for some random reason
Love being comsci, i have a couple of PS3 dev kits to my right
maybe because I changed the theme
psp dev kits in front

panda: IT BEGINS!
FlareChaser: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship
the town of brony
we ride at dawn 9in theory)
sharklion: yeah, already know.
FlareChaser: wasn't sure when you left
RainbowAsh as I said: it could all be fortune, made up, or it could be real, nobody can ever absolutly proof it :3
sharklion: I dont want to live on this planet anymore..
FlareChaser why?
Invi: Yes, but ultimate proof is just not the point of science. ^^
you didn't think it exsited panda
Invi: lol drunk :3
FlareChaser: but if you leave, how will you help us slowly migrate into brony?
so how is everyone today?
absolute proof is for math :)
Who wants drunk flare!? :D
/me is not good at the maths
RainbowAsh touchè ;)
FlareChaser: the Brony Invasion Plan needs your support! Every able body counts!
can't complain
..what the hecks?
/me Lifts and throws nuke into chat room, trots away quickly
We need drunk flare now.
brb
do it FlaeChaser and you'll be mayor
SonicTheStallion: save the nukes for the invasion!
/me grabs SonicTheStallion and pulls him back into the resulting fallout
Wasting wartime supplies... just shameful!
do it FlareChaser and you'll be mayor
/me gives some pickles to FlareChaser
It's not gonna blow, it's just a nuke that was never activated
laters~
it's dangerous to go alone, take these pickles
alexxm: alright fine, what do?
we invade Brony and make it our own
/me hits the nuke with SonicTheStallion until it explodes
FlareChaser: we all slowly migrate into Brony. to avoid outright conflict
/me charges into Brony
done.
then when everyone is there.... Brony belongs to Bronies!
alexxm no: we invade the country, call it equestria and keep the capital city Brony ^^
Invi: I like your thinking
Invi: We start small, just the town.
Invi: Brony is a very small place
easy to invade unnoticed
only 80 people Invi
There is only one stream Dan so yesh
ok; we invade Brony and we use it as our base to overrun the rest of the country
Om: ^^
do you know what country we're invading Invi
panda: Hmm?
Brony will be our landing point. we can fly in reinforcements from the rest of the world
/me licks Om :D
alexxm yep xD

panda: Ill pass that on

Don't invade. Just act kind
Damnit Wrek, you got me itching again XD
Walldives is so hipster!
So I presume were are going to name a road Pegasister you know for us fans of the opposite gender?
hehe
Om: aww :( why? D:

sharklion: nope, just a ass.
bloom**
imma be playin gmod cause there is no one to talk to, and I like to watch Wrek draw...but imma be bored.
yikes, bad typo
DerpStar: we shall build a sister village
panda: It means I will.
WallDives: :D
DerpStar as far as i know they don't like the term Pegasister
^^
My friend is a Brony, but he HATES rarity, what do?
Dan: Unfortunate typo. very different meaning
at least i'm honest with myself.
haha
wow
how can you hate rarity?
FlareChaser|GMod tell him hating is against the love and tolerance thing
drawing is magic yay
he**
Om: oh :D well., thank you
its open all night as well
Many people don't like Rarity FlareChaser|GMod
panda: Uh huh.
Dan: who hates RARITY!:[
I love rarity, her voice actor is amazing
Bronies love and tolerate?
yep
^
FlareChaser|GMod: clearly get him medical help.
Hey everypony!! :)
guys guys
lol hi panda
FlareChaser|GMod: Tell me about it. My brony friend hates Fluttershy.
Oh hai RaveBrony
I don't use the whole "love and tolerate" becasue this fandom has turned a bit ugly recently.
hi RaveBrony
RaveBrony! my cousin!
hiya RaveBrony
supe RaveBrony
hey RaveBrony hows your day been http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brony,_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA_Voivodeship we ride at dawn
sharklion what? why?
I didn't know about the "Love and Tolerate" till I came to Bronystate
moin RaveBrony
ZetaMetroidBrony: really?
ZetaMetroidBrony: Really? It is kinda... all over
/me waves to ZetaMetroidBrony, CCCP, FlareChaser|GMod, sharklion, alexxm, and Invi
Do I look like a /b/ronie to you?
love is overrated (read: worthless), tolerance will actually get you somewhere.
ZetaMetroidBrony: yes you do
Invi: there are certain people (not the majority, but loud) that just sometimes makes me hate what the fandom has become or may be becoming
No I am not
love is ambitous but rubbish
RaveBrony: we need more Octavia x Me, what do? beg? DO I YELL AT SOMEONE!?
ZetaMetroidBrony but it is on nearly every pony relatet webpage
This chat seems depressing.
We must remedy this.,
Who said I go to pony webpages?
:P
FillyFlam: hm? how so
sharklion: Well, yes, but negative people will always be involved in anything.
Invi can I be an honourany Brony then?
hey FillyFlam hows your day been
when we invade DerpStar
Dat invasion
DerpStar aks Lauren faust ^^
Ok cause if there isn't a Pegasister square or something
panda|animating: I come in and people are all LOVE IS AWFUL and talking about being concerned for the fandom.
Also hi alexxm, my day's ben great, thanks. :)
Finally got this nick back
also, hi FillyFlam.
FillyFlam: oh, you walked in at the wrong time ^^
I wonder why nopony finds spike's crush on rarity even a little taboo
sharklion i know what you mean, you don't need to love them, just tolerate.
Kriel_Pony: I know. and spending time in here has certainly made me more enthusiastic about it again (I haven't been in in a while) but i've known blogs or people to stop doing what they do because of certain bronies.can't be helped but has been increasing in frequency as it growns
Invi: indeed
please note, I am a cynical, bitter person whose opinions in general should be ignored.
Inb4 the epic brony downfall
12give me a ticket to disney world
Dan: Spike is a baby! it's pedophilia!
12ALL THAT POKEMON STUFF
sharklion: More people creates more problems, it's just a fact, but the only way to really counteract it is not to combat the bad but to support the good.
^
sharklion i would interpret love and tolerance as: what you don't love, tolerate.
Rarity friendzoned SPike :(
Kriel_Pony: solution:kill everyone.
Kriel_Pony: and I hope I do that and I hope people keep doing that.
TBH there are crazy idiots in every single group on Earth.
sharklion: It's more than that, they're not even the same species
I thought everyone was a crazy idiot :P
But it dosen't really do any good to fret about it. Just ignore them, I say.

Magical_pablez94: oh, hehe something for Sumica :D
and i dare say that i fell positively in love with it'S shotguns
its from a tape deck through a home built audio attenuation cable
panda|animating: I never kenw you knew how to animate :O
Angry incoherant singing, art, and Twilight sparkle. My extreme powers of deduction tell me Wrek is streaming.
Hi everyone
Allo everypony.
Acleps|Sleepy: I dont ^^
Meanwhile: you would be correct.
03attenuation?
moin Meanwhile
Meanwhile: WITCH!
05WE FOUND A WITCH, MAY BE BURN HER?
Lies. I weigh more than a duck.
panda|animating: So you're still practising?
basically its to lower voltage levels
BURN THE WITHC!
Meanwhile: oh, i'm sure it's very coherent... if you speak the language, that is
Wrek: Does she float?
Acleps|Sleepy: well, yeah
^
I imagine so Dark_Horst.
Meanwhile: but you MUST be made of wood.
Wrek: but of course
if you don't do this the results will be severe distortion
Wrek: how do you know she is a witch
ohai jim
no matter how low you set the levels
Ohai :)
05she turned me into a newt
Chrysalis: she turned me into a newt
really?
DAMN IT Wrek
05...i got better
You don't look like a newt Wrek
panda|animating: How long have you been animating for?
^
No.
>_>
<_<
oh hai Meanwhile
I'm back :) can anypony recommend me a mlp website with a good forum?
05MakerDusk: thoughts so far?
ohai Meanwhile
Acleps|Sleepy: well... ive only done simple stuff like stick figures, but im doing poni for the first time ^^
Dan: why would you need anywhere else but this place!
Dan: ponibooru.org
sharklion: ikr
Ponibooru has a forum?
panda|animating: Sounds awesome! :)
sharklion: as much as I like this place, I also like forum pages
panda|animating stick poniez?
Meanwhile: nope. that'S the jpoke. but psssst
Acleps|Sleepy: :D i know right?
Oooooh.
Dan, I am dissapoint. :D
Damn Boss eye doors
Invi: no... its challenging because Ive never done anything with actual depth before XD
but i found the most amazing discussions there, believe me
attenuation refers to lowering voltage levels in electronics
dat eye
perfectly enjoyable with a bucket of popcorn
cause I can leave discussions open for everyon to see, unlike live chat rooms where a discussion will end in under a minute or two
I read popcorn differently
panda|animating oh lol show me the result when available ^^
I like live chats and forums :)
Dan: ponbooru. it has comment-sections with pictures!
I like ponies.
sharklion you are supposed to eat popcorn, not to read them
Invi: well.. I'm hoping that Sumica will stream it, well... since its for him ^^
Dan: and wonderfully civilized people!
Meanwhile: what are you? A girl?
I think that counts as trolling Dark_Horst.
Meanwhile: I would gave never guessed! :D
panda|animating nice, when I miss it, link it ^^
sharklion: XD
Invi: dammit!
:P
Meanwhile: or does it? it makes me smile every day B)
okay, thanks Dark_Horst :)
Invi: for sure... I should have about 5 seconds of it done by the end of the week, hopefully my situation doesnt get worse ^^
Implying that ponibooru isn't a wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Meanwhile: well, there'S always 4chan
ponibooru? Wreched hive of scum? no...
Oh yeah.
oh? you're going to ponibooru? why not go through /b/ while you're on the way?
lol is ponibooru anything like /b/..?
Wrek: this is infected mushroom right?
seriosuly, /b/ isnt THAT bad al the time.
Dan: you don
sharklion... R1...
this cable is only needed for certain things
Dan: you don't know ponibooru? i amn disappoint
4chan is like if you took a wretched hive of scum and villainy and then set it on fire, put the fire out, let it simmer for an hour, then populated the remains with orphans who have spent their whole lives in the wild.
I'm a new brony D:
when recording from turntables it might or might not be necessary depending on the setup
ponies suck
Dan: and we love you all the same
Protip: When exiting Sector 4 (AQA) remember to lower the water level.
Meanwhile: apt description there
if the turntable has a built in preamp you will need one or if it has a ceramic cartridge
deadeagle: ponies are for fags!
yeahhhh
Dan: its an image-board. comment sections under the images. nice stuff happens there from time to time
ones with magnetic cartridges such as moving magnet or moving coil are roughly microphone level and work fine with a direct input
Dan: and nom it'S not like 4chan...though sometimes i get the feeling some of them migrated there
lol :$
sharklion: go horses!
doesn't 4chan have it's own pony section?
Is this music Swedish :O?
deadeagle makes me think of Eaglebones Falconhawk.
sharklion: Yup :)
yes, 4chan has its pony section
deadeagle: except shetland ponies. those are cool
but those are image boards
Protip: Don't swim in electrified water.
EAGLEPUUUUNCH!
not forums
you mean... PAWWNCH!
protip: when in doubt. whip it out.
Dan: you should check it out. ponibooru.org. tons of nice art lands there. just.... don't click at the red and yellow boxes marked questionable or explicit if you're sensitive
EAGLE KIICK!
/me kicks sharklion
PENGUIN PUNCH
When somepony tries to block, show them your c-wait what?
Protip: Run like a little bitch when being hunted down by a parasitic clone of yourself.

Meanwhile: gaychicken with traffic?
RaveBrony: between her and Celestia
Meanwhile: with Trixie?
Perhaps the meaning is different wherever you're from.
MakerDusk: Awesome! :) Never met a somepony who thot Celestia is best :O

For some reason i have 2 things
picking a favorite pony was the toughest choice I had to make in life
cause why not
Michael but the survey said, Twily is best pony
Well, I have to go now. I shall see you all at the start of the invasion of Brony!
"there's no best pony" is just a weird way of saying "Pinkie Pie is the best pony"
im bored :P
Invi: Yeah, you would think more people would like the ruler of Equestria :D
RaveBrony: You're...going...TO LOVE ME!
noooooooooooooooo

Hey guys, what was the episode with the parasprites?
bye sharklion

RaveBrony yeah, but everypony rather sees her as a goddess and not as a pony ^^
I agree with ACS13123 :P

I'm not a drawer, or artist.
Meanwhile: Really? it could be worse... i
Or have any skills in drawing :p
attention bronies i have farted
:O
Vordox i still prefer Lyra...
RaveBrony: well.. AJ, shes probably the "normal" one... and I dont think her character was developed fully :(
/me moves away from alexxm
alexxm: That changed my life...
Invi: Well just a random pose :p
Anyway, it's good training doing speed drawings.

RaveBrony x Applejack
lolwut
panda|animating: Ikr?? Its so sad :( doesnt even have her own song either... THEN many more people will like her i bet! :D

I would love apple jack as a big sister
I never realised how many channels there are...

RaveBrony: Yes, this shit is now canon.
alexxm: You farted, so i moved away from you :D

alexxm it killed his sense of smell

I dont do shipping :\
RaveBrony is Gamestop.

RaveBrony: Kill him and then ask her out.

RaveBrony: Nope, RaveBrony x Applejack, deal with it.
CCCP :'(
alexxm: Haha :D
I'm pretty sure pinkie is the youngest, pure speculation
jk Invi

Every time you ship an otakon, Wrek bans you.
Meanwhile: Nah, i dont screw with peoples relationships :D
CCCP :(
Fluttershy is a year older than Pinkie Pie.
/me hugs Invi

oh that's right, Meanwhile
You know what would be fun guys...?
moooooooooo
alexxm: Her bf beats the living hell out of me :D
what song is this?
When Wrek draws, everyone draw the same pony in a different way :D
That way, when Wrek is done, we'll all show and see who got "close enough"
I see pinkie as a 16yr old and AJ as a 19 yr old
Plus... she isnt really the kind of chick i want to get involved with...but shes nice to look at :P
Eh, that's too young.
i see pinkie as a 5 year old
knowing what you just told me about your picture Vordox i think its preaty good now
RaveBrony: you...stalker.
I wish i knew what was being said in this song O.o
hiya RX-78-SweetieBot

Doctor I asked my teacher if he was
/me grabs minigun
Om HA! I have a secret door for just such an acoasion ;)
There once was this guy who worked for the Railroad as a conductor. He was walking through the train, en route, collecting tickets from the passengers. He comes to car 12, booth 3. In it was a man. So, he asked him for his ticket: "Excuse me sir, do have your ticket?"
"I'm terribly sorry sir, I must have dropped it out the window by accident," he replied.
Well alexxm he's been my friend for like 10 months and just when I start to think I'm almost there he dates this random chick he barely knows and starts ignoring me again.. I'll be fine in time, at least I'll get out in two weeks...
"Sorry sir, we can't have any passengers without tickets." He grabbed the poor man by the scruff of the neck and threw him out of the train. Well, he landed on the tracks and was run over by the train. Naturally, the conductor was arrested and thrown in jail. He was convicted of murder before a jury of his peers, and sentenced to death by electrocution.
My gym teacher is one :3 Caught him watching it on his ipod
becaude FiM theme is my ringtone alexxm
Irish_Pony: Is that so.
my friend called me in class
dammit jailbait
/me hugs BaltoDork
/me places berrel inside another berrel and nails it shut
I got a theme
=3 thanks alexxm.
The day of his execution came up, and he was asked what he would like for his last meal. He asks for a banana. They gave it to him, he ate it, received his last rites, and was escorted to the chair. The executioner strapped him in, hooked everything up. Last, he threw the big switch once, and nothing happened. So, he did it again, and nothing happened. Well, by law the guy was legally dead,...
...so they had to release him.
I'm gonna keep going ya know.

Om and im not telling where because GilDash is in here with me, now if you'll excuse me *kisses GilDash *

Oddly enough, the guy got a job on another railroad, as a conductor! One day, he was gathering tickets, and came to a booth with a little boy.
"Young man, do you have your ticket?", asked the conductor.
I have a Picture with Alucard stroking Fluttershys mane... do i ut it into the ML or the castlevania Folde :( *First world Problems*
Litwick: hey calm down there!! what happened??
/me sprints away from RP in chat
I'm going to watch Felidae with some friends on tinychat Friday to clear up my mind. it doesn't help that I'm probably going to have to talk to him really soon and act like everything
s normal.
/me giggls at Irish_Pony.
Claude: someone in my media put the fluttershy how dare you in a film he did
http://www.zerochan.net/515074 this is how I sleep
alexxm That is cool
Magical_pablez94: Nothing happened. Forget about it.
/me looks adorable
guys, can I just tell you, I make the most deleicous grillec chese sammiches ever
alexxm I did an brand presentation in buisness on MLP FIM

DuskStarshimmer: I don't believe you.

My pony marathon is usually at night
:|
I am the female claude faustus I am a demon and I wnat to eat your soul
But But But, never ever for ever lie
Claude is a demon?
and nothing
Invi in anime yes
GilDash: you did say you wanted Irish in you ;)
"A-a-a, I'm sorry, I ate it by mistake..", said the little boy.
And.. the same thing happened -- the boy was thrown off the train and killed . The guy was arrested, sentenced to death by electrocution. It came to him last day. The death row guard asked him what he would like for his meal. He asked for banana again. He ate it, and a priest gave him last rites.
i might do an article about bronies for my media class Claude and just tell people the articles about unexpected fan bases
Invi http://kuroshitsuji.wikia.com/wiki/Claude_Faustus
Honestly after that, I feel legitamately pissed. Like I could punch someone in the face mad.
Claude are you a SPY?!
Irish_Pony: Yes, I did... ;)
ugh. loose laptop cord... ffffff
Meep anypone got a way to save severely soaped eyes? >.<
Litwick: Dude, calm down. It's over now.
/me pokes Claude and backs of

gday.

Litwick: ok...just calm down then :) i'm here if u wanna talk about it ;)
Airpuff: Running water.
hio again XAX
Invi I dont want your soul silly filly
He was escorted to the death chamber. This time, though, they were smart.
They washed his hands to get rid of any banana slime, they washed up the chair.
thats better >_>
/me meows
Next, they placed him the chair, and hooked him up. The switch-puller pulled the switch once, and nothing happened. The switch-puller pulled the switch twice, and nothing happened, not even a single hair raising on the guy's chest, and as the law states, they had to let him go...
GilDash: tryed that alredy ._. It still stings
Invi I want Meanwhile's soul
Airpuff: Saline solution, if you have any.
Just like Zacora..Not sure if I'm spelling that right...
Claude lol i don't even have a soul, silly :)
Zecora
DuskStarshimmer: o rly?
Even more amazingly, he got a job on yet another railroad.
well, it's 0:00 at night for me now, i gotta leave the chat now if i want to not-be-so-tired in school tomor... today
Still new to this land
This time it was a rabbi. Same old stuff. The Rabbi had forgotten to buy his ticket, so he was thrown off the train, arrested, convicted, sentenced to death by electrocution etc etc.
When the guard asked him what he would like for a last meal, he asked for a banana. He ate it, received last rites, and was escorted to the chamber.
GilDash: Saline... solution? ô.o
Invi let me taste your blood and see :)
/me noms on kirzstryfe
Okay..Thanks
kehehehe
bye

Lil_B: have a good sleep and such.
/me hugs ALL of the Chat
However, this time the officials where going to get it right! They scrubbed his body with a brillo pad. They scrubbed the chair with steel wool. They tried the chair on a few other prisoners and it all worked! This time it was bound to succeed.
So they strapped him in, and threw the switch once, nothing happened. Threw the switch a second time, nothing happened. At this point the guy was legally dead, etc, etc.
i'm going to do an article about bronies for my media class any ideas what to put in it
Airpuff: Okay, I'm going to assume you have none of that. :D Just keep up with running water, lukewarm preferably.
me hugs Lil_B back
cya Lil_B
/me hugwubbles Lil_B
GilDash: kai T.T
But, before the man could leave, the executioner, extremely frustrated . asked, "What is it with the banana!"
The man replied, "I just like bananas."
alexxm: Nothing that goes on here. :D
So, the executioner screamed, "THEN HOW COME YOU DON'T DIE!!!!!"
So the man responded 'I dunno'

ONLY DEATH!
Om: I'm not in Canada. I'd like him to be in me, but that isn't going to happen, so...
but that doesnt say anything XD
TheHoodyNinja wrong. it is the only attack that could harm a god
Blue Version is best Version

kirzstryfe: ok theres this glitch called missingno and M, missingno is kinda cool but it kinda screws ur game BUT M, M IS A NIGHTMARE CAUSE IT BRICKS UR GAME

Invi: do you have any gods to try it on?
/me surprise-kicks GilDash

Invi: I killed groudon too
GilDash: WE GOTS MAPLE SYRUP UP HERE!!!
Om: Then I win by default. :)

*shakes fist*
/me pokes Om continiously
but i havent kicked anyone yet
Dermathil: I prefer Golden.
GilDash: You cheated.
kirzstryfe: Problem with old versions of pokemon is that they are dying
TheHoodyNinja but no one killes Missingno
that's what Trollestia said
Om: It was a fair bet. :p
except LTB, who deleted her skype and requested it :/

Anyone likes Toonami?
bya Radu
I'm going to let Doctor get back on if he wants

Dermathil: Lyle's Golden Syrup is all I need. :)
Airpuff: Then do something that is not boring to you.
Invi: Killed that too
Airpuff: DON'T YOU SAY??
TheRainbowDash: that's how I call it at least. You make a hole in a maple tree, stuff comes out. That stuff is then boiled into maple syrup, maple butter and maple sugar, depending on how much water is left at the end. "Maple Water" is the unboiled product.
I've killed alot of things
/me repeats "Im bored."

Om: I didn't cheat with you. You refused the bet. :(
I like spain
cachi01: Oh, it seemed too natural to be that.
I liek Italy
Dude if someone bought me lessons I would be all "Hell yes"
TheRainbowDash: lol
GilDash: That's cheating in my book
MahBoi777: my i phones is trippin out nd not letting me to send it to my email :(
Hey everypony I'm back! I hear Jack Black.
While still sounding like the stereotypical teenager
GilDash so the likelyhood of you having superpowers that way is high, but to be sure, I need 2 more reference studies
MahBoi777: nothing i was just on tumblr and it said "send me "kill me" and i'll tell you how i would kill you" so i did
Biglaw: :3

Biglaw: Yeah, you can't get all of your stories to be good.

FlareChaserxOctavia: Youre 14?!
<.<
ಠ_ಠ
Invi: yep, ive only been here a couple of weeks
TheHoodyPirate: who the hell said that?
5.1 classical
Cobellanez: Okie doki loki
kind of overkill
5.0
i hate ur music
FlareChaserxOctavia: YOU ಠ_ಠ
no BMS/LFE.
superretroworld Do you know Lyra?
TheHoodyPirate: when? :3
Inb4 Spiderman.MP4
ILL
BE
FlareChaser being the manliest of men can aquire any mare he looks at.
IN
MY
BASEMENT
FlareChaserxOctavia: When you were drunk
three channel would be more appropriate as it would closer simulate the feeling of being in the audience in a concert hall
/me puts Prince_Lightboom in the attic
left, right, center
TheHoodyPirate: theres your answer.
Invi: no, is she octavia?
well, techinically, most classical is a bit overkill at >3ch because you're just hearing the sound of the room
SUKASHI!
:| i hates attics
/me breaks ceiling
FlareChaserxOctavia: Drunk isnt an age, silly filly ^^
(in the back speakers)
i hate zombies
mario_pony: :o
TheHoodyPirate: are you sure? :|
ZOMBIES ARE YOUR FRIENDS!
Daz righte
I hate stairs
^
thereare some classical albums where instruments are actually in the back speakers ginving an imersive experience.
I hate yellow jackets
superretroworld that are both famous background ponies along with derpy dr. whooves carrot top etc
let zomies go into pinkie diane pie basement
I hate helicopters
o.o
they will be happy there
Very nice Wreck.
So Happy?
i can name a few, planets by bernstein, nutcracker by don jackson, ravel by minnesota orchestra (those are the minority btw)
I hate ants.
Btw Fluttershy says hi :)
Prince_Lightboom: Pinkamena Diane Pie
Invi: oh, thens whos octavia?
I like this song, what is it?
superretroworld she is the pony with the cello
Invi: Wait wha?
pop music can be worth surround, although due to general incompetency, unfamiliarity, ignorance, etc, the surround mix is less than ideal in many cases
I don't want a lover like that
TheHoodyPirate what what?
mario_pony: yes pinkimena diane pie
Well, time to er...go into my ...uh...NSFW folder >.>
Cobellanez: Like what?
The song
Invi: In the butt

Will be back in a bit. I'm just gonna go read a fanfic. I'll keep this open. I should be back idk 30-40 min?
i just realised. its midnight and i'm still at school
by choice :S
Ponies47: Kewl :#
Alright, need to nom for a while, Be right back in 15-25 minutes.:D
:3*
I can honestly say, I dislike these types of songs. The lyrics I mean.
I think 2 channel stereo is fine for music
TheHoodyNinja: we should have pirate days instead of maid days for now on
over all
1,3ew
I liek maid hour though
nice Prince_Lightboom
superretroworld: maid HOURS GET IT RIGHT FILLY!
yeah i know :(
Cobellanez: I hate this particular song actually
CupcakeWarrior: is it maroon five?
i basically finish uni at the end of this week
which is terrifying
TheHoodyNinja: No, I love marron 5
maid hour my bad
4 years and god knows how much money
Maid hour? already?
Prince_Lightboom: seen it twenty time
and ill get a number at the end of it
Lol
i like this song tho
Its not maid hour yet
sorta, it is the most common channel configuration
Ew, Vinyl x Tavi.
new entry
FlareChaserxOctavia: Im sorry you gotta problem?
TheHoodyNinja: Nah, just joking.
its because what is the point of multichannel sound in music

Invi: well that was creepy :D
Good job Wrek

05wubwubwallpapers
because that's when it's commonly used
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: You speak RaveBrony as well?
yesh
it actually ads to the experience
Hi everypony :3
Kewl :3
makes it more imersive
hay Spell-of-Gaming
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Noooo!!! Not French!!! T~T a language i want to lear nSO bad....
hi Spell-of-Gaming.
Oh hai SparklyWaffles
hi Spell-of-Gaming
....
VioletGreySha: It all makes sense now! lol
hi Spell-of-Gaming
hahaha RaveBrony u mad bro
DAMN YOU TABBUTTON
plus the rear channel effects are used more appropriately
:D
hey Spell-of-Gaming
MahBoi777: IKR :3
Hi OMB|Piracy .3.
LOL^
:D
tetris :D
for ambient sounds of the area where the televised thing is taking place
2pm mix?
dat cute twilight
OMB|Piracy: i think u made a new friend
/me dances
AWWW YEAAAA
hey guys im Biglaw lol!
dat korobeiniki
05its the only one
05i like
Wrek: if u dont mind me asking how do u afford all your stuff?
hi Biglaw hows Biglaw doing?
good surround adds more for almost everything, including music
Wrek: it is SUCH a good mix as well
try to think outside the box
Friend? I'm too socially backwards to aquire such things
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: work
guys, I support FlareChaserxOctavia
Nope
The Hub will apparently show the new Care Bears it's debut on June 2.
05implying i own stuff
Nopenope
yes, yes you do.
Wrek: doesnt have job tho TheHoodyNinja
i'll give an example: "the scene" prior to 2012, was xvid for SD, and H264 for HD
Wait, what?
WAT IS THIS SONG I LIKE IT.
Biglaw: You should never support cheating bastards
Spell-of-Gaming: I think it should be streamed when it comes on
*breakdances*
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: He doesnt?
Prince_Lightboom: wow, that pic makes me feel depressed
Wrek: well u have ur computer
but actually, H264 also benefits SD
SparklyWaffles: korobiniki, aka tetris.
SparklyWaffles: 2pm's remix of the tetris theme
TheHoodyNinja: nah i asked him
/me glomps MahBoi777
/me bursts into flames
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: how old is he?
video is one thing
hey panda|animating!:D
Wrek: well u own u computer
audio is something else
the reason they don't do it is because xvid has traditionally used with SD, and so it stuck for a long time
TheHoodyNinja: u never ask Wrek his age
MahBoi777: hiya :D
05its called saving
Biglaw: QUIT CHANGING YOUR NAME!
I'll give the new Care Bears a try, but it has really crappy CGI.
TheHoodyNinja okay...
Spell-of-Gaming: do you think it will have a fanbase like the bronies?
yes, but the same applies - sticking to tradition is not always good
It wont
8,1evening, SparklyWaffles
another example of multichannel being inappropriate for music
Prince_Lightboom: O///O
ever heard of quadraphonic sound?
3?
yes
it was a big fad for music in the 1970s
O///O
but died off quickly
how does one save when one has no income Wrek ?
i have a few quad songs
HALLOO~
Denied.
8,1hey VioletGreySha!
because it was costly and the tech wasn't that great
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Get a job :P
because it really did not make sense to many producers to have 4 channel sound
8,1and RaveBrony
8,1and everypony else
:$
even though it was possible
/me 8,1fails at enumeration
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: he robs banks using the ninja skills i let him borrow
and went back to stereo quickly
all the hay :D
they did not see the point in spending the extra money
/me 8,1licks Invi back
because it really did not add much
Wrek: do rob banks?
same with 3D
/me husg Invi
Wrek: do u rob banks?
CupcakeWarrior: go through a list
/me hugwubbles VioletGreySha
it was a 50s? fad. , died off-ish
05varies form country to country but sicne im in high school i get 1000SEK a month to support m studies
there were even quad experiments in radio
And I am abck everypony.:)
(back)
in the 1970s quad FM was being tried
Oh hes in high school, didnt know :p
Play some Late Night Alumni. So smooooth...
wb TheRainbowDash
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQktoR0tr1w
but it failed to take off for the same reasons as quad in music
...MFW Wrek's in high school and not like 28.
/me licks TheRainbowDash
Wrek: COOL so do u actually study ? lol
Does anyone know of a way to force a game that only runs in fullscreen to run in Windowed mode?
hey TheRainbowDash
(is licked)...o_o
SparklyWaffles: theres a stream...
8,1CupcakeWarrior: it's a transitive verb, meaning to list off one by one
oooh i like this mix
http://askstreetgraffix.tumblr.com/ Ask me questions pleas!

I'm gonna wait until the 1st episode of the new Care Bears will be uploaded on YouTube.

TheHoodyNinja : Thanks
Wrek: Wow, that is absolutely amazing. I do not know how you can produce such extraordinary pieces of art like this. Keep up the good work!:)
TheHoodyNinja: there is no such option in the game I'm talking about
Kandarihu: What game it be?

MahBoi777: O____________O

So there was this article on Cracked, about how TV shows would end if the writers had balls.
most likely because you can't get over the air 3D TV
Mai mamma sayz
And this show was in it. Their idea was "It was all a game of DnD."
the only ways to get it are cable, satellite, or Blu-Ray movies
BBC is working on that
Light up some fire arrows and torch the kingdom
and video games to an extent
idk about the show... I liked the first book.
And there was your second pointless story of the day.
Wrek: was when boromir had his head cut of was that season one?
