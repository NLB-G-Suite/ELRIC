Ahh, good ol
I used to be able to play the piano, a little. Kinda want to again.
That's the crazy thing about my dreams. Sometimes they show me a thing or two, and then one day it actually happens.
Idk. I could. I think there was one dream I had where I saw the Gamecube logo even though it was a few years before the system actually came out.
It was a long time ago, but yeah.
Welp, gotta go. Later guys.
I dont think I've dreamed about ponies.

03well
03it's not only that
taking the mick out of old movies Acleps
03fricking ruins the value
Whats streaming
03but if you don't care about hacking and playing free games, there are a few first-gen ones out there yeah
the buffering cirlce
13Yeah, cuz I know someone who's looking for a backwards compatible PS3 and he seems pretty determined to find one
*cirlce
eh
03how much would he pay
/me runs
13even though I warned him it's be difficult to find one xD
03well "spare"
13*it'd
03basically I was stupid and accidentally updated it
03so no hacks
03:/
13how much would you sell it for :P
03around $200
03well "new", you get the idea XD
My day's been pretty alright
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/675/batman-credit-card1.jpg

13so that price is probably fine xD
pyrocatboy:i want that credit card
03but I'm assuming he's in the UK?
You don't know when to really stop.
13Yes :P
13> Paypal
03ah
03well
03I don't know if PS3 games are region protected
03but mine's a USA console
03if that means anything
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-feel-the-power-of-love-and-tolerance.jpg
well
pyocatboy: :D
PS3 games aren't, PS1/2 games are
03are they?
03can an American PS3 play UK PS2 then or no?
03ah
03so it would basically defeat the point of backwards compatibility LOL
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo1_500.png
There was a pony named joel, not to different from you or me
13apparently PS3 games are region free
well he could always import :p
03well yeah, but that seems dumb
13what I've always wanted to know is WHY WOULD THEY GET RID OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY TO BEGIN WITH
03and they're idiots.
03that, and money
La La LA
03now, why did they get rid of the emulation that second-gen PS3s had? No idea, probably because they're idiots
Mitchell!
03but the first-gen ones actually cost a crap ton of money to make xD
apparently when they abandoned it they had something like 500+ PS2 games that needed to be Special Cased for the PS3 and even more being discovered as time went on
the*
03er wait
03special cased?
I like to call it Mental Entertainment
different internal emulator options
03ah
03that only applies to the second-gen ones then, right?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0u3v2dCn41rpfifpo2_500.png
not sure, but that would make sense
xD
talking*
03I don't quite get why they named the hardware emulator "emotion engine" :P
03makes it sound fancier than it actually is XD
Cambot
gypsy
crooooooow
isn't the emotion engine one of the chips from a PS2?

Hi, Goodafternoon everyone
its harrassment at wost, sadly.

Why did you link that to me.
I just thought it was ridiculous how he got away with it.
Why not?
Because it's cool`?
Link some to me to!
Fair enough.
which is a misdemeanor, iirc.
Mods are away, post humans.
the problem is, at the end of the day, suicide is still a choice you do to yourself.

/me hugs Acleps.
Some.men like very young women
03LOL
Preferences etc.
03Yeah I'm more in the middle
03I prefer they be *not jailbait*
Acleps: Where did ja go?
03but otherwise
03:P
dat stream
I don't care, as long as they're within my age range
03which is?
/me runs
He is 16, me 17
03no I mean
03age range
03:P
asdfmovie 5
Other two, 8 year diff and 4-5 year diff
Uh
12I don't see the age an issue
/me licks Saturn
<_< >_> need more Rule 65...
03It's only an issue if they're like 13
Hey everypony!
03which is my point
03:P
/me does not like being touched
whats rule 65?
/me 8,1melts

12Personally I won't fall for some really old man or some really young kid
Needs more Twilight.
05hehe saturn :3
12but if others both actually want to be together and legally aged
12wynaut
13^
12 year old and 20 year old
I mean something's wrong with that
It would be diff if 12 year old was older
Likw
20 and 28
Anyway, drf
05jsut takign it smooth with some good music, twilight and i dunno
Age range, well
03wowla

12yeah 12 is underaged
12I mean if its legal
12which is 16 over here
0316 is here too
03which is my point LOL
GilDash:...(just wants to ping you)
03but I think most people would still consider you a pedo if they're "minors", or under 18
This is getting weird real fast...
/me flies off.
wow, and to think this is PG.
hey kids
Tbh I'm saying 16 for now because generally people shouldn't be dating below that age anyway, otherwise lol preteens

this cable is only needed for certain things
when recording from turntables it might or might not be necessary depending on the setup

Maid hour? already?

i like this song tho

the only time it would make sense is live recordings to reproduce the sound of the concert hall where it was produced

incredible

yes, yes you do.
i'll give an example: "the scene" prior to 2012, was xvid for SD, and H264 for HD

yes
O///O
Dat Saturn :D
but died off quickly
i have a few quad songs
hay Saturn
HALLOO~

because it was costly and the tech wasn't that great
because it really did not make sense to many producers to have 4 channel sound

hi Saturn.
all the hay :D
/me licks Saturn
hey Saturn
they did not see the point in spending the extra money
Saturn: no you dont, you just don't batch it :P
because it really did not add much
same with 3D
Hi Saturn welcome to weird world
it was a 50s? fad. , died off-ish
there were even quad experiments in radio
And I am abck everypony.:)
(back)
in the 1970s quad FM was being tried
hey Saturn , any interesting scientific physics literature you might recommend?
Oh hes in high school, didnt know :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQktoR0tr1w
but it failed to take off for the same reasons as quad in music
