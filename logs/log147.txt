Dat stumble
07,01well in the 80's there was no PG rating and such
That gull is in blackface.
All dogs go to heaven: Main Character died at the start of the movie
Animated?

yup
13lol
Pinkamena!
Heh
Sheeees BaaaaacK....
All dogs go to heaven...I saw it on the hub like 2 months ago
Wait, the whole reason they are there is to get some female rabbits?
Its not supposed to go at an angel!
YES
THAT is the reason
We need them whores
we can escape from everfree
The entire movie is about gettin some tail
rabbits need to reproduce
OH FUCK
WE NEED SOME PUSSY
We must sex
supreme goal of anture
/me presses back straight away
We horny
Go get us women
like American Pie, for bunnies

YAAAAAAAAA! YAAAAAAAAAA!
>mfw that seriously offends me and i know my rights.. i read the rules
I still dont understand why this movie is called watership down.
I'm afraid not
Look it up.
This film is filled with symbolism.

bunnyboat!
<3 this film
Then the women find out they only freed them for sex
And they all lived happily ever after…*turns off movie*
I Think theres a reason its called "Watership Down"...
VAT U DO NOOOOOOW
they were freed to become sex slaves
They're in a Watership...
it's named after a real place called Watership Down
and it' about to go Down
NOOO! Wathership DOWN!

Hmmm.
Is that canon?
>_>" sorry if I bothered you guys earlier. Tried not to ._.
Bothered us how? :0
Anhedonia: It's fine.
We don't mind :3
Though I have no idea how to cure writers block myself.
that happens often, don't worry about it!
well okay... Sorry I misunderstood

...........
sorry I'm trying to obey the rules best I can. As in not overusing abbreviations/faces. It's a bad habit of mine. Last thing I want to do is annoy anyone
Psssh. It's very, very difficult to annoy us.
Anhedonia, it's fine! We're not that strict as long as you're not spamming
one*
well even still, I'll try my best not to be a bother.
We are all bothers here :3
/me sighs
We pretty much accpt everything exept spam :P
Even working like I am, dude still makes me feel unproductive.

No worries
Hey can i make a song request?
I dear
Hey Splooge
oh no
RD's voice is best her
not this
Daribot does NOT APPRECIATE MY BULLSHIT
no Luna is asleep now
Splooge, Luna is asleep
I wanted to make a request for the 8-bit "At The Gala"
But no, really. My friendships always last, mmm, a few years, I'd say.
But i guess its a lost cause now.
And then they just quietly vanish.
But this song seems really odd.
O.e
Is GGgala for real here this time?
Just yesterday I got in a really bad argument with my sister. It sucked a lot.
how old are you herospirit ?
Oh lord.
and do you move a lot?
Not too old, and I haven't moved since I was little.
This is actually a little catchy.
Last time i moved was about 6 months ago.
Me and my friends just deift apart, I guess.
still, I'm sorry to hear that.
drift*
I just really wish somebody was for real streaming, Not on a damned playlist.
One thing he forgot..
PINKIEQUEST
Yah, sorry. I'm dragging everypony down again. :I
I'd stream if I could. I have no way of doing it
you're not dragging me down herospirit
I don't mind talking about these things
/me heard the words "love and tolerate" and is now in the mood
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
FUCK IT
I'M NOT DOWNLOADING ANYTHING UNTIL I GET SOME CELESTIA BANNED TORRENTS
TheItalianStallion is Italian and this translation is COMPLETELY ACCURATE
I feel good for that old man.
It looks like he just won his hears content.
Is Pinkiequest still on their playlist?
*hearts

Hopefully.
I hope it happens.
He has such an awesome voice.
me too
Well heres a 40gb torrent of pony pics... http://www.ponychan.net/chan/media/res/13388.html#13388

Gah stupid commands
Bye for real.
08,01Yes that is me XD
Dang it...
haha
herospirit: but I normally dont do these to people because I like being neurtral
/me still thinks this playlist needs a little dab of PINKIEQUEST or SCOOTAQUEST.
PinkieQuest! Yes!
Distrust? That element does not exist
/me agrees
someone has to start a conversation with me in order for me to talk to them.
Pinkie proved this.
08,01oh look
08,01wait hmmm
Ridiculous, Splooge.
Well...Let me tell you
"Distrust is the best way to lose a friend....FOREVER!!"
EXACTLY, SPLOOGE.
It's for the OHC.
by distrust I mean neither trust nor have reserves about
well okay but still. Hope I don't bother you
... never again.
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613 <---- Sad fics
Wait, not even I have have given you reason to distrust?
you look really cool Fluttershy

inb4 g3.5 ponies invade
(aka 80's ponies)
suddenly Applejack is best pony.
Welllll, I guess you know my state, Nat.
And my age and gender
But that's a lot of potential herospirits. :P
Applejack: The pony everyone forgets when someone tries to recall the main 6.
I dont know why i laugh when somebody does an inb4 joke
>_> I always remember Applejack.
I don't forget any of them, but I lose count and think I do. :0
Somehow.
WHy.
I'm...
agnostic = win
Agnostic is kinda like...
like...
"What religion are you?" "Like I fucking know."
ponies IRL is my favorite meme of ponies
Agnostic won't believe anything without proof, but they don't doubt anything from lack of proof....
I'm technically agnostic I guess
I'm just apathetic
"The absence of proof is not the proof of absence"
herospirit: I think you mean "The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"
:I
AWAKEN!
bit*
XD
.... sorry. ;---;
/me slaps herospirit around a bit with a large trout
No
/me hugs Starflower
:I
...Sorry Nat 20.
can we not turn this into a religion thing? Thats wat episodes of "Feeling Pinkie Keen" are for
NNNG
Feeling Pinkie Keen was my first live episode.
/me hugs herospirit
I still CANT BELIEVE people turned that episode into a religious debate
sorry >_>
Ya I thought that was going to happen but I never really expected it
It kinda pisses me off, you know?
lol I wouldnt know actualy
:0
I hope lesson zero does away with the letters.
well tht was a link for him then
It doesn't upset you that they turned every discussion of that episode into a religious debate?
Kinda
ponies IRL is cool
I know, I dont either
It didnt effect me therefore why let it make me mad?
*hate
but I cant mention the episode without a debate popping up.
