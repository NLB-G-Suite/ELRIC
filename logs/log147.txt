Lolz
Luna I am but the blue is blinding
Yes, Yes there are
The blue is easy to read. :/
So, viewers.
6You all are clearly blind if you can't read blue on black.
blue is awesome.
hehe
dark blue?
Not like Dari's dark blue.
/me goes to the bathroom
Shall I continue on Veemi, or try Owncast again to see if it's fixed.
'sup Dari?
SirSprinkles: I guess Im blind
try OwnCast?
Hey guys, im back
07,01try own cast
What did I miss?
Try Owncast imo
Lets try the main site
8I'm going to get kicked for using colors :P
worst movie ever, LordCelestia
If this one works well, could we perhaps stick with this?
Give it a shot, if it doesn't work we can always switch back
try it
I vote Owncast.
11So, what did you all think of the epically awesome Airbender movie? *trollface*
/me is blind
not all of use have out monitors on full blast
"Please Stand By. SuperBrony64 is now changing the movie to WaterShip Down. Thank you for your paitience Everypony."
:O
SuperBrony64?
/me will jump on the application bandwagon as soon as there is a call for mods.
I read, "these movies need more cleavge at first
Hes a streamer?
watching it once was enough for me
/me puncehs Silverscreen in the shoulder
It was absolutely wonderful, that epically awesome Airbender movie.
2,14 stop repeating that over and over
Clearly one of the best movies of all time *AJpokerface*
spiderses in the popcorn
6WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN I KICKED THE ENTIRE CHANNEL?
cleavage*
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO US
I applyed in August
Silverscreen I hate you and now I don't think I want to share my list of pony episodes we watched.
I think it can be summed up with a reference to ms paint adventures
I'll also see if I can set up the stream using NewOCD's perfect epic stream method.
BLUH
/me chucks another bottle at Silverscreen.
Sorry admin.
Where was Gondor when that movie was released?

No, But fuckloads of gore..(I hope)
The stream doesn't appear to be working at the main page, for me at least.
06Patience we are getting it up
Everyone switching streams at the same time is bound to give lag.
I vaguley remember Aang getting hair at some point
Tha's what she said VioletVanilla
I can't say if it is just my internet failing. It did refuse to show the stream there earlier.
hey, anypony here on Pottermore?

Huh, we're five minutes in and plots are getting blessed. Must be a good movie.
And you're not helping making it less dead by not even joining :c
Thank ye kindly.
The artwork and animation looks good
13I hate that term "Pegasister". Sounds stupid.
/me doesnt care about a small chance that Octavia is not a girl. Octavia's plot wins all no matter the gender.
am I behind?
Holy plot

Pegasister sounds too long
huge eye

/me cant look at bunnys now. too distracted by Octavia's plot
Just do with brony. it's not like mankind and womankind are separated.

Octavia never lies about such things
That wig isn't very big.
...i liked his series design better
mom told me this was a kids movie
he has great HARE
there for Octavia's Creed is best
Implying that the grass in his mouth is brighter than the one on the ground
that'd be the sensible approach
starchaser0 isn't it?
It IS a kid's film.
WHAT
this film is unclassified
13Somehow that rabbit actually grew hair on his head...
It's a kid's film with nightmare fuel.
Hell I'm a proud brony but I'm not gonna start flame wars ect
if going against the grain is really too harrowing
it has blessed plots
This is what kids were allowed to watch back in the day...
I watched this as a kid.
Jolly good. Egads!
and bunnies tripping balls
Anyone who thinks this is bad for kids should GTFO.

What a wonder.
it means youre a badass
It's a boat
sigh, Redwall gets so repetitive after a few books. or after two really.
Its a witch
ITS A MANFLOAT
no one wants a shipping bot?
whatever floats your boat
I am bird, I don't speak smartly because this bunny movie
It means He survived Wolverine
shipping bot?
FINISH HIM

Hi everyone!
I love DnB, Trance, Electronica, Orchistrial, Clasical
I mean they can be similar at times but dubstep tends to need dubing and annoying tempo changes
Dumori: This.
I prefer Hip-Hop and Mario Paint :D
favourite band = Three days grace
I don't know why I like dubstep, but I do.
Well, some dubstep.
Not all.
And a certian Indi artist that goes by WaterFlame mixes these very well
Roonry = Favorite Band

But I completely forgot to target.
Eh, what harm can they do.

Rarity's not a gold digger. That's Spike's job!
dah dalanadena
because gold isn't very useful...
Gold digger
YEAH!!!!!!!!
that was made of win
*BREAKING NEWS: In followup to the terrorist attack, Al Quaeda appears innocent. This due to the many pieces of planted evidence found which blatantly stated "NOT made by the Robotnik Coorporation"*
the person who made that video is my new god
this again? imokwiththis
*fiddles with missile launchers in his absence*
Code Monkey, Hell yeah!
Right, I'm back.

Stop doing that.

Hey it's me!

/me Java's
Mostly because you just threw that thing together and it does nothing.
Python is fun
C *is* worse
ThePretender: I suppose it would be hard transferring.
C++ is tolerable at least.
oh...what about this *holds up the guidance systems and launch button* i think it got stuck before i took it out
CriticKitten: Sweet mother of god C. Never again. Unless I am paid extremely well.
Ah, you picked up the decoys. Remind me to install new ones.
Has anyone had to "program" in MatLab?
What are these C's?
Err. Sweet mother of Celestia.
I had to learn it in my undergrad. I wanted it to die.
Stonegaze: Programming Language
Oh.
anyone else saw that?
C's just awful.
thats ok then...

To defeat the hunt? WHAT?
07,01Well... as long as it's no movie or pony eps.. I can stream pretty much everything
because i got a vid that technically has pony references...and will make you lose braincells
/me will get down to business to defeat the huns.
my favourite pmv! ty luna :P
so why can nopony stream those eps?
I like Vinyl vs Aussie's iPod, but it's not really pony beyond Vinyl all over the screen.
07,01because they are part of our show
well... maybe that new Weird Al Polka video?
07,01however, I will stream S2 episode 1 & 2 tomorrow
I've had all my weird al after last night xD
Polka Face I think it is?

/me would turn into jelly but is not jelly of himself :3
Also, DashWithRainbows yoy never got the chance to play Tomba!
I want to hug jack now =(
what is tomba?
Tomba! is actualy spelled with an "!"
You are a Japanese Pirate!
more nostalgia?
It is wpic
Wait, he didn't take the sword?
Epic
if he had the sword straight away the show would be over too fast
and a new copy will never be made again...
I guess
DAT MONTAGE
he has to earn it wit a spiritual journey
or something
Oh I've not seen new thundercats yet
and a digital version will never be made either...
It's the Kremlin!
Is this episode one? I don't remember
Rarity is best pony:3
/me sadness
Man, I was planning on waking early to go to the gym but not anymore if we're watching this =(
/me Im over it
Say Luna, if you're still here - is this a full film?
I haven't seen the thundercats PERIOD
Dat horsehump
Dem ponies
Applejack derp.

JACK LIKES PONIES
Dude! Scorchman1337's mom watches this! That is so WIN!
And that's how Applejack was born

It is? Good, good
My mom watches this? what?
WAIT! slap me now. I miss read
Ah.
my bad
you missed read?
He's now off to train with dem afrikans
I am mad confuzzled
THis is the training montage
I read quick and saw "man" as "mom"
it makes no sense
/me thinks it amazing at how little dialouge is used.
lol nice
/me remembers the cartoon network flash game where you play as jack training in different places
OH GOD I LOVE THAT PART
Jack is too awesome for dialogue
3Test again :3
herospirit good times
07,01lol
Herospirit I remember that game as well!
07,01Superbrony is a mod..

Going to bed. Bye everypony
Eugh.
Well that didn't go well
I want to play this game that you are talking about

The sword training was my favourite
If I remember right, Jack doesn't talk for like 10 episodes XD
Night Rainbow-Dash !

Sleep well!
Night Rainbow-Dash

AKUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
ib4 SPARTA
Night Dashie!
I am mad jelly now

SPARTA!

Jack dropped him!
just to make ThePretender right
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN AKU TOOK OVER JAPAN
Oh god
ITS ROBINHOOD
/me sighs
This cartoon is not historically accurate! My immersion!
Jack is homies with Robin Hood!
He even went to England!
The archery level was fucking impossible
lol
He stole! xD
ahaha
herospirit: THIS, JEEZE
Vikings!
omg norway?
Vikings, F- yeah!
herospirit: I had no prob
Where hasn't jack been? xD
Kremlin again?
I like the canyon jump
Russia?
Samurai Jack: The Chuck Norris of the cartoon world
EVEN RUSSIA?!
He's destroying art!
that's a new meaning for a matrioska
Mongols?
I'm done here!
the first place was probabaly Istanbul
Shaolin monks, heck yes!
dat hot sand
and the Tibet?
budhist monks
Jack is so boss
jackie chan does that bucket one
irl
That sailing level, dear lord.
By Luna I love the sound effects
nice
i do that bucket one
in my dreams
lol
and only there
I am Jack, in my dreams
So he basically traveled the world learning every martial art ever. :0
well, I mean I could do a few
thats when you know it is too damn cold
but not a whole bucket
not anywhere near
those must be some sweet ass dreams
Its mom!
THE MOUNTAINS ARE TOO DAMN HIGH
Yay, a happy family reunion
Happy reunion time :D
<3
Aww
I got the feels guys
seee spiritual journey
time for sword
I know that feel bro
AWWWW YEEAHH!!!
wut
He has finally earned teh sword.
Jack is what, 30-something here?
More like LEARNING TO FUCKING KICK ASS journey!
Or early 20s?
prob
sweet ass dreams about filling a bucket
nasty
Late 20's I would assume
lol
23, I think
oooooooo he mad
23-28
CloudRunner
He looks too manly to be 23
I'd say late 20s, yeah
Buddha sure has nasty teeth.
that is MUCH nastier if you've read Homestuck
About 800 years old, if the time periods he visited are any indication.
yes? you dinged me herospirit
lol
nono lash
:I
He's definitly around 30 in the series.
he talked to the dr
He needs alot of time to learn all the martial arts in the world xD
tardis comes in handy
Noted.
herospirit: I dont even want to know
Push da wheel
dat one guy
BTW.
So does he get sent to the future at the end of this episode?
/me punches herospirit in the face.
dat slave
dat break
Lol
(This has a reason)
Heya. :p
WHAT DID I DO
oh god poor Jack's dad
aw lashy you remembered :D
And CloudRunner
What a dick!
That 'wKhoosh' sounds gets used a lot
probably not
you sent me to the moon yesterday..
Well, that's how you said "hi" last time Herospirit. :p
LIKE A BOSS!
OH YAAAAH
I just thought i'd return the favour.
How could I forget!
god you don't even remember us :(
JAAAAAAAAAAAACK
He's too manly to cry, he needs to use water.
/me round house kicks Lasharus
DANG!
slice and dice those BEEEEEYAAATCHES
There we go.
Also, ow.
TvTrope: Bloodless carnage.
"nice to see you again!"
And you Herospirit. And you.
This is better than the karmen rider last night xD
yes
samurai jack. samurai jack. sa mu rai jack. Jack, jack. jack jack jack.
That I'll grant Scorchman1337.
My, fon
Jack takes that trope to the extreme in that he doesn't even kill aliens or monsters
HE SPOKE
THATS THE DAD!
Only ever robots or spirits.
If Rainbow Dash dashes off
OMFG
FLUTTERS
What does Samurai Jack do?
DAMN
He kicks butt
Of course!
I was going to stop you
^Scorch
BEGIN to take over the world? Took him a while, didn't it.
precisely
But you were too fast
he jumps in a TARDIS!
he had to gather power lash
...for plot reasons
He got slapped

He remembers it!
Arentius, what did I tell you?

/me spent lastnight camping in a bush outside of Luna's house

I'm kind of indifferent towards it... I'd still not watch it if there was alternativess
hey, I saw this episode half a week ago
every show deserves 4 episodes before it deserves a negative oppionon
/me liked Garfield better as a comic.
EVERY SHOW
Good grief.
/me tolerates the shit out of this show (just pretend it's a troll)
/me just loves cats
I've seen enough to know where this is going
For all the lack of characterisation Garfield has in the comic, this isn't him. :P
CloudRunner: YEAH!
Cats rock. And this is an unbiased opinion. *nod*
/me has unfortunately seen 4 episodes

Edward_Newgate: then you may hold a negative oppinion on it
Hi.

Demon's Soles are a bit worn out, to be honest...
shes entering that haunted house like a baws
Ha Flutterz
hmmm, how recent do movies have to be for BMN?
hey hey hey listen hey. I have an idea how about herospirit calms down and let's us watch the show without negative energy
Anypony know how much a good punching bag costs? :0
Flutterguy It is a game that everypony neads to play before dieing. Flutterz that was awesome
depends what type herospirit
Nnnng I have negative energy

to recover
CloudRunner: I'd like to see you try that on me. ;3

So the girl openly exclaims that a cat is trying to get revenge on her. Smooth.
herospirit: and then pull you out quickly again
/me trots over to Luna as asked.
herospirit: and then throw you back in
/me sends kitty flying on a rocket
I don't get out of depression easily. :0
/me pats CriticKitten softly
Anger, yes. Depression, no.
herospirit: eventualy it just overwealms and then strikes with pure cute
herospirit: and then you die

i have a feeling if this movie was made it would be a nostalgia critic episode
Flaria what's about Dash's cursors?
or mst3k
Should I have the rainbow flow in one of the directions the stretch cursors point in, or emanate from the center outwards?
dawwww, dat pic
Fyi, Derpy is a level 8 bag ninja.

Flutterguy: Do you think straight lines moving or arrows moving would look better? IE: |||| compared to >>> of color
Flutterz that would take a while. also those with Diabetes might be in trouble
if I did that
:(
Cats cause earthquakes
I am so in the 90's
wait, what are we watching again?
i would rather carry needles hidden in my pockets than to have a metal pole on wheels follow me...
I will do a few more though
Flaria, I dunno.. sorry :/

I can't think of any cat pokemon that can create Earthquakes

I didn't know there were FIM fan animations O___o that's so cool
Though I have no idea how to cure writers block myself.
that happens often, don't worry about it!
We just didn't answer because we have no clue what you should do
well okay... Sorry I misunderstood
We really should have said that though. :[
that's okay
http://nerdfighters.ning.com/photo/album/show?id=1833893%3AAlbum%3A3255311&xg_source=activity close enough
Lagmobile. I'm not sure whether to hate or love you right now
Do both?
I hear angry sex is awesome
lol
...........
sorry I'm trying to obey the rules best I can. As in not overusing abbreviations/faces. It's a bad habit of mine. Last thing I want to do is annoy anyone
still new here. Please go easy on me! Promise I'm not here to bother anyone.
Psssh. It's very, very difficult to annoy us.
This Image is a very happy one! unless of course you have read "Today, Tomorrow, and Forever" then it is heart breaking. guess which on it is for me... </3 http://i.imgur.com/AqfgR.jpg

Oh hay isnt this Chrono Trigger music?
I'm waiting for Nick Cage losing his shit
Alright, cool. A lot of people get confused about the whole several pages and stuff.
Lagmobile: Is it? I wouldn't notice
I know I do :P
it is not making me sad (thank god) because of all that cheeze!
No really is it? I cant remember...
Cheese is delicious
the first time I saw Twilight "turn" in that episode I got really really sad.
Full of CHEESE!
and not sad at all (plz dont try to proove me wrong, I rather like cheese)
Me too anhedonia

Yay Alex S.
TIME TO PAAAAAAAR-TAY!
I have the glitch remix as my ringtone
/me is shufflin'
one of my fellow brony pals told me that there's some contest or something that OCs can become canon background ponies
is this true?
One man can break a friendship in ten seconds flat.
herospirit: just about killed me when he said that... I am so lucky the next thing I looked at was this. http://i.imgur.com/ADyAR.gif
I dunno, Anhedonia.
LMAO CloudRunner
hmm. It would be interesting to know. Just curious.
Thats so cute
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/ponychan-imager-crawler.html
Anhedonia: They were taking in OC's for background ponies later on, but that was a while ago

I think it's really cool that this site streams movies a lot. I can't help but always ask this, but, what are you guys's favorite movies?
for that thread of wallpapers I gave you guys
That is best gi
herospirit: a true friendship is physicaly impossible too break. Ive had people try
Natelyn: oh, okay. Thanks.
I am a supercreeper and I've turned it from Facebook to ponies and EqD :l
In that case CloudRunner
I have never had a true friendship, and never will.
my ass you never will
Deal with it. BI
/me huggles herospirit
You're my little beta tester and you will be forever. :l
Long after we stop testing~
Mm.
In my experiences, no matter how strong a friendship, it can, and will, shatter.
/me shrugs
:I
I'm really sorry to hear that herospirit...
Actually no.
Shatter would be better.
It wil just dissappear.
/me is never amused!!!
Sienty.
it sounds like you've had a lot of emotionally draining friendship experiences... I mean I wouldn't know, but, that's just the sound of things...
:I
is that true?
herospirit: do you need another dose of Dawww to straighten up your additude!? http://i.imgur.com/Aqhtf.jpg
Oh hey I JUST found a new wallpaper thread
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/462612.html#462612
LOL. Dat auto kick
I've seen that a lot, hero, but every friend I've kept on the internet I've kept for years
Was gone longer than expected. Sorry guys.
's cool SploogeTheFish
/me feels thae hate from Natleyn
No worries
Hey can i make a song request?
I dear
Lag...
Hey Splooge
oh no
RD's voice is best her
not this
Daribot does NOT APPRECIATE MY BULLSHIT
I'm not sure whether you love me or want to see me suffer watching me download this.
no Luna is asleep now
Splooge, Luna is asleep
At the gala
I wanted to make a request for the 8-bit "At The Gala"
But no, really. My friendships always last, mmm, a few years, I'd say.
But i guess its a lost cause now.
And then they just quietly vanish.
But this song seems really odd.
O.e
I've had a lot of bad friendship experiences herospirit. I'm not claiming to know how you feel or exactly what it's like for you, but I know that things like that are very painful.
Is GGgala for real here this time?
Just yesterday I got in a really bad argument with my sister. It sucked a lot.
how old are you herospirit ?
Oh lord.
Well, they're not painful, really, since they're so, I dunno, quiet.
and do you move a lot?
The person that sounds here...Is for real the Queer in the steer.
Not too old, and I haven't moved since I was little.
This is actually a little catchy.
Last time i moved was about 6 months ago.
Me and my friends just deift apart, I guess.
hero, I'm going to love and tolerate you as long as I can contact you :l
still, I'm sorry to hear that.
drift*
I just really wish somebody was for real streaming, Not on a damned playlist.
One thing he forgot..
I hope you know what you're in for, hero.
PINKIEQUEST
Yah, sorry. I'm dragging everypony down again. :I
I'd stream if I could. I have no way of doing it
you're not dragging me down herospirit
I don't mind talking about these things
hero, I know how you feel. Cause nobody really speaks to me anymore.
/me heard the words "love and tolerate" and is now in the mood
This pony who is singing is really dragging me down
I don;t understand. Is he a pony, that like, freakin sings?"
/me hugs Veewave
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
TOOT
oh I saw this video, it was funny!
/me hugs Natleyn
Bronystate in a specific video? HOW CAN THIS BE?! :D!!!
This is so great
Lag...
FUCK IT
I'M NOT DOWNLOADING ANYTHING UNTIL I GET SOME CELESTIA BANNED TORRENTS
hmm... untill recently herospirit, I havent stayed in the same place for more than a year. I can still remember my friend in 4th grade. every last detail. I can remember all of my friends in 6th grade. and so on. I havent seen/contacted them in years but they are still my friends. forever.
TheItalianStallion is Italian and this translation is COMPLETELY ACCURATE
I feel good for that old man.
I cant believe theyre bronies too! ^^
It looks like he just won his hears content.
Is Pinkiequest still on their playlist?
*hearts
4th grade was when I made my first friend btw
I think there will be world peace once everyone alive becomes a brony
^
Hopefully.
I hope it happens.
CloudRunner U so silly
He has such an awesome voice.

But it's like trying to get everpony to play the game.

Bridle Gossip*
Wonderful, CloudRunner.
Splooge... you're not doing much now, are you?
herospirit: :D

Whats that sentence, Cloudrunner? D:
Heya Fluttershy`
CloudRunner, try me~
Depends on the person, Splooge

Hooray for this song

^Is that you fluttershy` ?
/me huggles Flutterguy goodbye
08,01Yes that is me XD
Dang it...
I always imagines you as a yellow pony with pink hair
haha
herospirit: but I normally dont do these to people because I like being neurtral
/me still thinks this playlist needs a little dab of PINKIEQUEST or SCOOTAQUEST.
PinkieQuest! Yes!
Answer me this bronystate. What is the essence of "distrust"?
08,01Wut you think I have pink hair in real life? lol not QUITE yet at least
Luna just left the stream on a playlist and went to bed
pink hair is awesome
Distrust? That element does not exist
/me agrees
08,01she did? Luna really did that? o-o
someone has to start a conversation with me in order for me to talk to them.
Pinkie proved this.
08,01oh look
08,01wait hmmm
Orlynao? I dont think he fell asleep, Or i dont really know what the fuck he did
SploogeTheFish: I distrust everybody untill they can prove otherwise
Ridiculous, Splooge.
We can dance dance? http://i.imgur.com/tzNTY.gif
Well...Let me tell you
"Distrust is the best way to lose a friend....FOREVER!!"
I tolerate and love you, CloudRunner.
I'm sorry if I ever provided a reason for you to distrust me CloudRunner
EXACTLY, SPLOOGE.
lol, Fluttershy`, you are adorable. xD
It's for the OHC.
by distrust I mean neither trust nor have reserves about
Orbital Hatred Cannon, for the uneducated.
100 percent neutral
well okay but still. Hope I don't bother you
You dont tolerate and love me? :'(
SploogeTheFish: thats why it is very importiant that my friends are trust worthy
Right so who wants more pony stuff?
... never again.
Well im doing it anyway!
you have given me no reason to doubt any of you so you are good in my book
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/436613.html#436613 <---- Sad fics
08,01So who saw teh picture? Am I not funnay looking? XD
Wait, not even I have have given you reason to distrust?
Cause i hate to lose friends, Let along be an asshole to anybody who did nothing wrong..Im like fluttershy with the ego in here mind titled "Do No Harm".
you look really cool Fluttershy
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/469387.html#469387 <----- Sad fic recovery
Fluttershy`: You're pretty cute, imo.
Lag please say that "one" (shudder) is not in there
oh man I'd love to write Pony fics but I doubt I could
Agreed, Natleyn.
Okay you know what fuck the Hatred cannon
one of my friends dared me to write a sequel to Cupcakes
08,01lol thanks

Breaking emotions is for pansies
Herospirit, Abandon that abominaton.
"One" CloudRunner? Theres ALOT of sadfics... that thread has all of them... and no Cupcakes isnt a sad fic
I'm making a NORMAL laser cannon
herospirit: umm... thats actualy the friendship cannon

But for now on, Ive been addicted to The ducktales music
ok Im good for the night. That fic wont get to me. Have moved it to the "steel box" section of my mind. It wont get out for at least 16 hours. (unless I re-read the fic itself)
oh man
SploogeTheFish: THE MOON
Especially the moon soundtrack
'nuff said
what would the title of ponified Chicago be?
Yup
I had an ex girlfriend who was all over Chicago
Took a bit to do but it is done
Exactly what im listening to
you know what I wanted to do?
dub Bridesmaids over FIM
sounded like fun
too bad my video editing programs stink : /
INTO HIS HEAD
use to do that with my anger. ended up bad after a few months of it
^lol
Ive always wanted a girlfriend who didnt care i was a brony...This seems like a lost cause :'(
My anger comes in violent bursts, usually.
^this
So true.
I don't know how it affects my chances, but
I haven't dated ever since I became a brony
my ex left me before I became one, though
You mean this Anhedonia ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgqx3o0JmhU

Yes, Natleyn. Why?
at least I don't have to do it now
herospirit: Do you remember the Adoring Fan?
Calmest person you could ever meet. untill I snaped. when I snaped I snaped hard. last time I broke my wrist because I was litteraly trying to kill my brother. Couldnt control it either. stoped "bottleing" my anger after that.
...Yes.
When i get angry, I hold it all in, But then when i finally get pissed off the notch, I just let of a really big ass angry scream, And i feel better.
I remember the adoring fan.
herospirit: I am your adoring fan. Except, I'm slightly less annoying, a lot more huggy, and I'm faster and more invulnerable. :l
I dont like screaming.
so that didnt work for me
dont think i got far enough to meat the adoring fan
Silly Natleyn.
meet*
There are a LOT better people to adore.
herospirit: so humble *swoon*
lol no homo
:p
this vid is...
what?
Oh hero, I'm not exactly adoring you
I don't hurt people when I get angry. Unless like, they deserve it.
/me can't rap and can't sing but will do anything for loo-ooove.
Tovler's got it right ;D
herospirit: exactly
brb
herospirit: This is just normal friendship for me. xD
Your bro deserved it? :I
I do this to everyone. :l
my bro threatened me with a knife. Sharp objects are something nobody should ever point at me
Finch-What is it to burn plays when it get it too much over the edge..
Well, in that case CloudRunner, I'm glad you beat his arse.
did not beat it
and back
What is it to burn is my angry song
held him off the ground vader style
sorry : /
Still works CloudRunner.
then my other brother lifted me into the air. freked out because of it and let me drop
he had it coming.
he had it coming.
He only had himself to blame.

He threatened you with a knufe.

now instead of bottleing I throw something at him every now and then
he doesnt tell whole store
implaed upon a stick?
storie
ow
Did he say cancer yet?
I missed it...
/me hugs Natleyn
now where was I?
Remember, you.
Where'd you even
You know what? I hate my brother sometimes.
Ugh.
/me hugs Starflower
He knows im a brony
KILL THEM.
And he says that we are faggots for watching it.
...I wub my siblings. They are fucking awesome.
suddenly... what would happen if I bottle what that fic did to me over and over again?
I told him that he is missing out
hmm
He told me to fuck off
I just left him after that
Really. My brother introduced me to MLP FiM.
Mongreled bastard needs to try it out before critisising it..
oh wow
I think before I go to sleep every night I will just have a good cry so I dont get all emo or some shit
guys i have a problem
I was introduced to FiM by a friend
Cloud...
manly cry mind you
And my sister plays video games with me all the time.
/me huggles CloudRunner

I wish I could help you
lol Octavia x Vinyl Scratch thread http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131717035241.png
what?
I don't know what to do
I love this video!
Anhedonia: what?
I feel left out all time, I reallly dont know why.
about everything
your emotional stress
/me unmutes his gay-music playlist
sounds very painful
I was gone from the room for a long time now
no dude not your fault
a while ago i had a pinkie pie plushie. i cuddle it every night. today i got a twighlight sparkle plushie and i don't want her to feel left out but i don't know how to snuggle two ponies without favoring one over the other...
Anhedonia: My bro's the same. I just point out to him that I'm perfectly comfortable with who I am and what I like, and that maybe he's not comfortable with who HE is if he's mocking my tastes.
its actualy very refreshing
Also the original song for this is "Frontier Psychiatrist"
huh?
Ctrlx.
haha, I just now read the rule change that happened from Toyland.
havent felt emotions like this EVER
You have
how do i snuggle two ponies?
have it on my iPod
Snuggle with em both. I got 2 smurfs. Thats what i do.
sorry, I'm a little lost
wow talk about typoes, I almost accidentally said lust
my grandmother died and I didnt care
that've been awkward
dog died. didnt car
oh...
e
My brother is a homosexual and thinks ponies are childish, I kicked him out of my house (I tend to kick people out of my house when I'm angry.)
You have the BEST FUCKING PROBLEMS EVER, ctrlx
Whoops, *Splooge. Sorry for the accidental highlight, I'm just trying to catch up to the convo :p
more OxVS http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131709526344.jpg
Babes in Toyland isn't legendary. Nobody could have seen that coming.
one of my closest friends died. still didnt care
Its ok :P
Lagmobile <3
I got a little woried about it actualy
But yeah, I basically turn it on my bro when he does that.
Maybe if I had a Twilight or Pinkie plushie, I wouldn't hate the world with such a fiery passion.
Frontier...
Still guys
i guess i'll just kinda like...stack them...
herospirit: This is now one of my goals. :l
What should i do? My brother wont shut the hell up about it.
What is, Natleyn?
herospirit: get this man a plushie!
well let's see how it goes. gnite everypony~
2) Get herospirit a pony plushie
Oh god
And for everyone who missed the first one http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131717035241.png
/me huggles ctrlx goodnight
Sleep well!
I wouldn't hate the world with a fiery passion if I died and passed away into Equestria. >___>
love that pic
Night ctrlx
3) Get me an Apple jack plush Oh gawd. I would be happy.
I don't think I could hate anymore if I had an MlP FiM plushie with me. :I
John Joseco is freaking awesome
crookedtrees is a genius
I love Joseco and Crooked to death
TO DEATH
/me is halfway expecting Natleyn to learn hacking just to find my hometown/address and send me a Twilight plushie
MagaSweet is... well, MegaSweet
anyways I have never felt love/sadness over any living thing. this emotion feels good. still cant apply to actual things but still. its nice
herospirit, it's not very far from what I know already :3
*looks at pinkie pie plush images*
inb4 g3.5 ponies invade
(aka 80's ponies)
suddenly Applejack is best pony.
Welllll, I guess you know my state, Nat.
Whole Octavia image thread... just octavia stuff: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/447808.html#447808
Applejack is so great >_<
LAG IS A GOD!
And my age and gender
But that's a lot of potential herospirits. :P
Applejack: The pony everyone forgets when someone tries to recall the main 6.
I dont know why i laugh when somebody does an inb4 joke
>_> I always remember Applejack.
I don't forget any of them, but I lose count and think I do. :0
Inb4 SploogeTheFish laughs again
Somehow.
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah AH
Actually I just have a thread with a link to everything... I may be Agnostic but I still dont want to be smitten so here it is http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
Lagmobile: Why.
WHy.
I'm...
agnostic = win
It's so hard not to just go download everything ever. :l
love it
I absolutely love this video
Did you need help downloading stuff? http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/ponychan-imager-crawler.html
Natleyn: second
agnostic = neutral neutral
Lagmobile: I don't have the space, though. :[
Agnostic is kinda like...
like...
Agnostic means dont belive there's a god but the possibility of a higher power
"What religion are you?" "Like I fucking know."
ponies IRL is my favorite meme of ponies
Agnostic won't believe anything without proof, but they don't doubt anything from lack of proof....
I'm technically agnostic I guess
08,01I love singing this song...
Fluttershy`: Same
I'm just apathetic
I feel that there may or may not be a highter power, bu tim not going to waist my time wondering and Im just going to live my life.
"The absence of proof is not the proof of absence"
If he does exist I like to believe he has a stach of thunderbolts in a giant bucket just for people like us
thats what agnostic means to me
herospirit: I think you mean "The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"
:I
what herospirit said!
AWAKEN!
/me slaps Natleyn around a but with a trout
bit*
XD
.... sorry. ;---;
I just assumed Agnostic don't think about God. As in they don't care enough to think about.
/me hugs Natleyn
/me slaps herospirit around a bit with a large trout
No
/me hugs Starflower
:I
...Sorry Nat 20.
can we not turn this into a religion thing? Thats wat episodes of "Feeling Pinkie Keen" are for
NNNG
I say Im agnostic because there is no better way to describe it in one word. but the best way to describe it is "I just truely dont care"
Feeling Pinkie Keen was my first live episode.
/me hugs herospirit
I still CANT BELIEVE people turned that episode into a religious debate
/me slaps Veewave around a bit with a large trout
sorry >_>
Lauren couldnt either
The lesson made perfect sense in the pony universe.
Ya I thought that was going to happen but I never really expected it
It kinda pisses me off, you know?
lol I wouldnt know actualy
:0
wait who said they loved the ponies IRL meme? http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/466089.html#466089
I hope lesson zero does away with the letters.
I really wouldnt. I was born a counter troll
Lagmobile: Splooge did
well tht was a link for him then
All I have to say on the matter is: Haterz gonna hat but we'll still love and tollerate the shit out of them.
It doesn't upset you that they turned every discussion of that episode into a religious debate?
Kinda
ponies IRL is cool
It's a one-sided debate so far
herospirit: nope. bacause I didnt participate in those debates
I know, I dont either
It didnt effect me therefore why let it make me mad?
*hate
but I cant mention the episode without a debate popping up.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wHwJoxw4i4&feature=related once again hooked to another 8 bit song by randomly navigating
welp, back to my gay-music list
.... dat beat
herospirit: ignore it and it will actually go away

Why in some episodes there is an "ei"?

Chistianity is so broad. I don't know where to begin

Thank you Fluttershy

Hey why is there ei in some episodes?
Please?
I will. I apologize.
EI?

You know what was depressing last night?
/me hugs Fluttershy` too
You remind me of the babe!
Fluttershy` evolved into Weezing?
What babe?
feels bad for Fluttershy`
Fluttershy` I have asthma too. Do you have an inhaler?
Counting my meds was depressing last night.
Nobody replies to me :'(
The babe with the power!
What power?
herospirit: whyso?
/me huggles herospirit
08,01No I mean... I haven't needed one yet anyway, even though I've been given one before
SploogeTheFish: reply
I don't think I've ever wheezed before. Sounds scary.
15 pills a day, with an inhalent twice a day.
what you need SploogeTheFish ? the anthology thing?
Oh. Well maybe bedrest can do some good. I usually wake up and im not wheezing anymore. MOST of the time that is, Fluttershy`
It would be cool if we could play it, But i still think luna is still streaming
Luna is streaming but is asleep
08,01hopefully it wont turn into anything worse >_<
how can you do that?
08,01I get bronchitis easy D:
