05its good ^_^
Lil_B, wait what?
Not complete either
RAWRity: Sewing school?
Yes thats the one Wrek :)
SRSLY has any one tried splicing rainbow dashs lines so that she says gimme twenty bits
!!!!!!!
Invi because Angry Birds is worthy of getting an Orchestrated version over everything else appearently :(
Lil_B: Wait, wait?!
AJIsAwesome: oh shit, she's late for friendship http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fwtzGIWZ1qfcanco1_500.jpg
Lil_B, yeah... apparently....... I bet they bought it since they want to become a trademark
05i cant have doom music without this one!
AJIsAwesome scroll up and look at my previous post XD
Lil_B: Angry Birds is overrated in my opinion.
nuu, poor bunneh :(
05all i can hear are arch-viles everywhere >.> <.<
never played this Physics engine :/
has any one tried splicing rainbow dashs lines so that she says gimme twenty bits
angry birds is fun... the frist time you play it, and the first few levels...
psh
casuals
some one ANSWER MEEEEEE!!!!!!
yeah. it's a simple slingshot game
but it gets boring
Angry Birds is a decent little time waster, but the company behind it is oversaturating. There's AB plushies, fruit snacks, keychains, pillows, EVERYTHING
fucking casuals
ikr?
Invi: Combine that with various themes, it's the Ipod of CoD.
it's not really the game that I dpn't like, it's the Company... Rovio thinks they will be as big as Disney... with Plushys, Cartoons and Coockboocks all out or in the making
RAWRity: Agreed.
Cookbooks*
AJIsAwesome, you mean CoD of Ipod ^^
I don't hate Angry Birds, it's just they keep milking it.
RAWRity: I'm actually really pissed that you find Angry Bird toys everywhere where I live, but you have to search for ages for a mlp toy :(
Lil_B, megalomania is very common today ^^
Eli: Same here.
RAWRity: Why?:(
05meh
05bad one
05here we go
AJIsAwesome: like I said, morbid curiosity. Same reason I watched Carebears for an episode.
RAWRity: i liked the frist episode of annoying orange, then it gets repetitive
the hobbits to isengard
RAWRity: The new one? How is it?
I do not know what Care Bears is about
I ripped the Doom Samples from the SNES game... if only I had a DAW that could strech samples without transposing them I could make god music with them (they are all awfully short)
AJIsAwesome: boring as all hell.
/me sets a tonberry next to Wrek

trying to recreate a guitar in the Oeatmeal VST Synth... i did in once somehow, but the safe file doesn't work
and this one just makes ma laugh http://derpy.me/Zw1Z8 :D
dont know exactly why
Alchemist: Don't get me wrong, but that joke has been run into the ground.
bah. My text is all goofy. I think my flash broke
AJIsAwesome: I just came across it yesterday
so is the judge dredd movie good
AJIsAwesome: what is that a picture of anyways?
Alchemist: Oh. That makes sense.
it seems they are desperate to make a meme out of anything these days
AJIsAwesome: didnt even know what it was about
AJIsAwesome: the news didnt report it in my country
AJIsAwesome: i still find it pretty funny... just because i find it hard to believe they let her do it, and that she didn't realise she has no talent
Bronysith: It was a terrible attempt at a resotration of a famous picture of Jesus by an amateur artist.
AJIsAwesome: and tehy made it official?
Is there a mod in chat?
What are you guys talking about?
Wrek just left and I think Sumica is here.
Ohai MASF123
Bronysith: People have been trying to make this a meme, but it's been really annoying.
AJIsAwesome: she's not even an amateur artist... she's jsut an ole lady
Hi Pinkies4thWall
Sumica: you in here?
hi
Applejack2012: hi
Eli: I know, but they call her an "amateur artist".
Sumica you there?
AJIsAwesome: because otherwise, the shame on them would be greater for letting her do it
AJIsAwesome I kinda liked the pictures I saw on memebase XD
I feel bad for her, though. I didn't even laugh at it when I first saw it.:(
I guess he left...he was here a while back.

SuperBrony64: We do it lateh! D:
11,02No YouTube links please.
Goodbye poniesareweird
A stream is up?
bye!
SuperBrony64: I is in a Xbox party with Moopy, and he's wondering when his ban expires.
poniesareweird: Bye!
I need to refresh
Do you know?
Hello SuperBrony64!
I no see a stream
Pinkies4thWall SUperBron64 is here
no stream?
dunno
stream not flowing
Vordox I finished my Remix of Luna, now I can work in the animation again, I made a CTR (or TRC? :/ ) TV on a chest but I'm not quite satisfied with the design (especially the chest looks WAY too old XD
SuperBrony64: sorry, didn't see any steam :(
Hey Kawaii_icybeauti!
I am in dire need of tea and jaffa cakes, brb
Ohai MadSurge
Lil_B: Show me later =3
11,02Pinkies4thWall: He was unbanned over a month ago :)
ok :)
Is there a stream?
Can you believe back to the future is 2 years from now P
:P*
Who?
I tell him
...
:(
Ok fine then.
dafaq is going on?
So, is that a new stream software I see over there, or just reskinned?
I miss KwakLad...I wonder if he comes here anymore.
I see no stream.
SuperBrony64: no sister to play with? =3
11,02She's at school >>
11,02Kawaii_icybeauti: Refresh your stream embed
Not the stream, but the like, player. It looks nothing like the one I'm used to.
A stream is up?
I did.
Also I have no stream.
nothing happende
But I don't think anything's up
Do I like copy the wierd code thing?
Evil stream service is EVIIIIIIL!
SuperBrony64: Oh Superbrony, you have MIPS on your end, but it's LimeV on the stream embed
Kawaii_icybeauti: Nah, there is no stream on right now, I don't think
SuperBrony64: But there's still no stream...:(
stupid asian women ads!
11,02Try again now :)
Kawaii_icybeauti: When there is one, you can click the 'refresh" button right below the player.
ok
SuperBrony64: There we go. =3 You're welcome
oh there it is
Oh hey, that's the one I'm used to, haha
Refresh is next to pop-out
11,02Vordox: Yeah, I know, I just swapped it :P
I had actually pressed refresh multiple times.
Someone ping me, I'm trying out the embedded client
SuperBrony64: Silly Ubertechie SuperBrony64 :D
he said mexico o.O
Yay, NSMB Wii.
Super Mario?
Get 99 lives to get Mario without a Hat.
Kawaii_icybeauti: Didn't you know, Mario is anti mexican
MASF123: I did that too.:D
I never knew what the POW did...
The infinite 1-Up glitch is still in this one.
Kawaii_icybeauti: It goes... "POW"
As good as this game looks graphically, it tends to drag on. Plus the music seems recycled as you keep playing, making it boring.
Wait is SuperBrony64 talking in the stream?
So I know that I'll get a lot of grief for this, but I've never played any Mario games besides Kart and Party
tSparx: No problem.
tSparx: I'm worse. I've only played NES Mario
tSparx: You're not really missing much.
Huh, I get no ping noise. That won't work.
Hey guys im back did you all miss me
YAY NSMB!
Same applies to Zelda. I just never went Nintendo past NES
I rented Wind Waker when I was young, but it was Twilight Princess that got me hooked on Zelda.
hey im sorry what i did back then i just wanted to chat thats all
AJIsAwesome: ... i can't agree with you on that one. New super mario bros has always been a great game to me. it's a game that doesn't get old in my opinion
Those smilies sure are cute though.
I have returned with biscuits :) Biscuits for everyone :D
flutter_spin: do you prefer other companies?
Eli: That's fine. I think it's a good game. It's just not a game I would keep playing over and over again.
its not that. I just never got an SNES, N64, or Wii
Without those, no way i can play the games
Is SuperBrony64 going for a speedrun? :D
MLP_Brovakiin: Thank you.
OH SHAT SuperBrony64 stream?
CrimsonPhoenix: yep :)
fan neato
AJIsAwesome: have you ever played vs on the ds? it's the single most amazing game on a ds. sadly, no one ever challenges me anymore :(
and i promiss i will listen to the mods i pinkie prmiss and i will not be a troll ever again
I went through a phase when my mother remarried. Everything had to be "fair" with my stepdad
Whos streaming?
And if my stepsister couldn't play... well I couldn't
console wise I still go with Nintendo, if though they too do things that make me cringe sometimes, it's the least bad of the 3 console manufactures
Rex_Mundi: SB64
wait who streaming
LoGaN: SB64
^
Eli: You were talking about the DS one? I LOVED the DS one. :O I wish it had online versus, though.
Piece of crap disconnected
Eli: I was talking about the Wii one.
Anyway, is SB64 talking on the stream?
we have a stream and i was not infomred? shame on you! SHAME ON YOU ALL!
AJIsAwesome: oh yeah, that would be awesome :) i liked the wii one. but the DS one was better yeah
no talking
Dark_Horst: Hey, there's a stream on!:D
SuperBrony64: could you do live pony reactions after this? every time you have one its late at night and i cant be involed cause im asleep. just asking...
I don't pick sides in the console war. I love PC, I love all three consoles, but when I have to choose I go Playstation, then Nintendo, then X-Box
Dark_Horst there's a stream up! :O
AJIsAwesome: SHEIM EN YEW!
en yew tew
Dark_Horst: Se\orry. Had to do that.:$
tat's cool as hell
hello
Go down the pipe! :D
I go Nintendo>Xbox>PC>PS3.
Sup Soviet Russia

N-Gage>All other consols and handhelds :P
Hallo CCCP
Hey CCCP! :D
I don't pick sides when it comes to consoles, As long as the game's good and I'm getting my money's worth, it's fine by me.
For me it's nintendo, xbox, then ps
Lol. N Gage
hello MLP_Brovakiin and MadSurge
MadSurge: in soviet russia, pipe gos down you
But, just like the ponies, and many other things, even my least favorite I still love.
CCCP: Hello!

AJIsAwesome: agreed. i have favourite games on every console
Nooo!
My spinny
D:
tSparx: well, LEAST FAVORITE, not hate :D
/me is playing RED DEAD REDEMPTION
:)
/me does not care
MASF123| why thr caps?
MASF123|: you have xbox?
Each consoles as their faults and pros
Sup nameless pony #9237 :)
CrimsonPhoenix: Eeeyup
i love FF, but i wouldn't go just ps without a Brawl from time to time, or have a nice round of TF2 on my pc
CrimsonPhoenix: pros and cons
360 though has the biggest with its pay to play online feat
11,02Unlucky :/
lawl SuperBrony64
ha
Awwww
CrimsonPhoenix: so much advertising and you still have to pay 50$ a year
LoGaN yes I do. CCCP because that's the way the game is spelled on the box art.
^^^^^^At Bronysith
MASF123| oh i downloaded the game so i wouldnt know
y?
360 is basically, advertisement the console
MASF123|: friend me wait whats your name
CAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ADVERTISEMENTS
thats why you pay 50$ a year
ya yoshi! wooo
cause they have to pay the advertisers
CCCP the boxart is still shown when you pick the game on the dashboard :/
Sorry. My bro msg me. He was asking about playing Minecraft.
Don't kill Yoshie D:
yoshi is my favourite nintendo char of ALL time :)
Meh I don't care about the ads on xbox
LoGaN you want to play RED DEAD?
MASF123| yeah but its small
sure
webinz has the worst ads by far
I remember Yoshi's story and Island on 64 like yesterday :'(
webkinz
MASF123|: Can I join :)
YOOOOSHIEEEEEEEEE
YOSHI IS EVIL
i like Red Dead's story more than the multiplayer personaly
Umm...I dunno.
those hips are too small
Dat porn Bronysith
Yoshi's story is the first game I can remember. That and pokemon stadium :(
What are your Gamertags?
and it ain't porn
it's cosplay
Vordox: thats not porn
CCCP Agreed.
I don't own any of the current consoles, and I've missed out on SO many good games, like RDR
tSparx: PC
isn't RDR on PC?
Anyone here who has Rome Tota war should check out EB, ie-the greatest mod for anything ever.http://www.europabarbarorum.com/
I think it is.
Vordox: how is that porn?
What are your Gamertags...the ones that want to play RED DEAD with me?
Eli: It just is... Ever heard of a "Playful " or "Dirty mind"? :P
(the reason I don't own any of the current consoles is because I'm a poor college kid. even $60 is too much for a game, waiting til RDR goes down in price significantly. If I owned a console, though, I'd rent it from somewhere.)
Vordox, that's a perv
Is it hard controlled, SuperBrony64 ?
how did this get to porn o.O
11,02Hard controlled?
Vordox: well, your opinion i guess. i don't even find it pretty. more like a turnoff
CrimsonPhoenix: Images of sexual content, wether it's suggestive or not = Porn or leads to it =P
Vordox comment a Jessica Rabbit cosplay pic porn
SuperBrony64: Hard to control Mario
11,02Not really
Vordox, you have a loose definition of porn
people would be much more peacful if they were Asexual
CrimsonPhoenix: The world is lose, not me =P
SuperBrony64: Don't help him.:D
for me it's the moment a genital is present in the pic it's porn
haha
CrimsonPhoenix: I think that's too tight.
CrimsonPhoenix: True dat
CrimsonPhoenix: Inb4 World Freudism. :P
Hey everypony O_O
I personally don't try to define porn.
Sup Ponies47 !!!
CrimsonPhoenix: but what if it's nudity for the sake or realism?
CrimsonPhoenix so then some old epic works of art art porn?
Last call for RED DEAD REDEMPTION Muliplayer
are*
MASF123|: dat caps
there is this thing we call tasteful nudity. that aint porn either
hi Ponies47
dem
RAWRity, CCCP good point
porn according to urban dictionary: the reason you need a new hard drive.
Dark_Horst: And that's why the world is lose.
Yup that's how it's spelled
Kawaii_icybeauti: Lawl
MASF123|: I accepted the friend request, just waiting on you now :)
RAWRity: some of the best art throughout history is nude right?
What about the other guy?
Bronysith: Technically, yes
MASF123|: wat ur name?
Kawaii_icybeauti: or the reason you GET a hard drive :P
And that's...World is Lose
loose*
Bronysith: yes, though back in the day, the Pope actually went ind of batshit, and had the penises of many statues in Italy torn off. Meaning that somehwere, there's a big old warehouse full of cement dongs.
porn is stupid
waaat?
it is not
CCCP: go die
LoGaN :(
CCCP: Agreed
RAWRity: You don't think they just crumbled them up?
LoGaN: don't ever react...
LoGaN, MASF123
over*
LoGaN: wow. I wouldn't go THAT far
We love CCCP here
tSparx: my idea is funnier
LoGaN: Maybe we don't ask people to day?
Still I would hardly call a cosplay of a classic character straight out porn
when I went to italy, I remember seeing all the nekkid statues.Being 9 at the time, I laughed extrememly hard at each one.
RAWRity: Oh, my bad. I never let truth get in the way of a joke either, entirely my fault :P
to die*
CCCP: it is stupid. but can you really say you don't do it?
Kawaii_icybeauti: Haha I still do the same, god I am immature :D
MLP_Brovakiin: Most humans have the humor of a 12 year old boy at most.
Eli im fairly sure there is no porn of me... one sec
so yeah, the Vatican is filled with castrated statues.
CCCP: :P
Okay, enough talk about porn=/= Nudity/genitals etc etc, Let's get back to within realms of the rules here, would we? :P
Vordox: Agreed.
You started it
Yeah this chat is getting a little awkward.
im 13 so my humer is around 6 Kawaii_icybeauti
Kawaii_icybeauti: I find life to be better when you are immature
I wasn't even paying attention to the conversation.:D
CrimsonPhoenix: It's the Art paradox again, there's no end to it =P
LoGaN u hate me? :(
MASF123|: invite me
CCCP: idk
CCCP: your emotes dont help your case
Art Paradox?
Hold up both of you finishing a mission.
Almost done.
CrimsonPhoenix: "Everything and nothing is art"
The pic had nothing suggestive
/me das Mario
CrimsonPhoenix: I disagree
sometimes i'm so tempted to spam Bronysith with emotes :P :)
Bronysith im not holding a case and even if i was im pretty sure my arm would be enough to support it off the ground
I like how we had a stream of doom before this
/me do be do be do be
CCCP: and thus why LoGaN hates you
:C
It's Jessica Rabbit dammit a bit more and you could say Who framed Jack Rabbit is porn
CCCP: you're a friggin smartass
guys, the picture was a pinup. at most. those are not porn. there is nothing to discuss
seaponies
CrimsonPhoenix: Her very essence of a depth character was based on her suggestive form and style...
roger rabbit**
CrimsonPhoenix: Wait, thats what all this is about? Yes, she is suggeststive, but not to the point of being considered porn.
Images tells words. P
hi Moopy
Seriously, why are we still on this topic?:D
Kawaii_icybeauti, exactly
well, actually there is a lot to discuss, but that steers off into different directions
If you want to argue, PM each other.
Oh yeah if you wanna know how freshman only day went for me. PM me O_O
Dark_Horst: All over the place, therbey, the World is Loose :P
Ok I'm hosting just wait.
LARRY KOOPA!
hi Moopy
Hmm, I just got back onto the stream and I notice that my old comp isn't liking mips
neither is mine
what a HACKER
hey logan
You know SuperBrony64 ...Next time you play a game, play on the hardest, and no save, once you die you change game. :D
no stream?
Bronysith: SB64 doing Mario
CrimsonPhoenix: A sec then CrimsonPhoenix
o there we go
i had to refresh lol
CrimsonPhoenix: Aw, they removed the article. :(
The swim noisein this game reminds me of Donkey Kong. =P
CrimsonPhoenix: The thing is, what is art, and what is not, what is consider art for art sake, and what is consiered not art when it does not want ot be art.
><
Pop quiz: if all the ice at the North Pole melted, by how much would the sea level rise?
It's a heavy philosiphical discussion, which has no end, due to opinions.
Is this the new Mario game SuperBrony64 is playing?
I can see that
Ponies47: Nah it's the old MBSWII
Vordox: Ah
CrimsonPhoenix: Therefore, an art paradox. :(
I hate i, but I cannot deny it's existance.
oh look, past sins has been revised.... wait what, they still work on that?
DAT SPAM
so basically if one would think that Jessica Rabbit cosplay is porn than that individuals has a pervy mind that would influence his opinion.
i thought the whole thing was like... closed case
CrimsonPhoenix: That's one way
Invite him
the mailbox guy to the posse
god
tidus is so ughhhhhhhh
I personlly would say that JEssica Rabbit was MADE for being suggestive in her core, due to her artstyle, floosy character and what not, "Sexism" is the very basis of her creation
I see that when I watch any picture of it.
how do i describe tidus? whiny, bitch?
The lines by the creator under the art <--- I like to analyze.
Welp.
I knew it.
Answer: Not at all! It just so happens that ice, being slightly less dense than water, floats at the top. The amount of ice left below the surface of the water takes up the same volume as the whole ice cube would if melted.
Bronysith: a walking advertisement for partial birth abortion
the sole purpose of jessica rabbit was to get men drooling over a cartoon character
RAWRity: how do i snapshot that?
and from what people tell from back then, it worked
still, FAR from porn of any kind
is everyone still bitching about that jessica rabbit cosplay i posted?
Kenpachi's been killed. OFFSCREEN NO LESS. Someone, most likely monsters in GW2, will pay dearly for this. :|
11,02:<
CK|GW2: YOU ARSE
lol
Oh bad luck
What a dick move game
CK|GW2: DON'T SPOIL FOR F*CK SAKE
I predicted that one, too. >_>
CK|GW2: What?!:|
Bronysith: dunno, i just throw something in now and then at the keywords "jessica rabbit" "porn" and "art"
11,02Who is Kenpachi?
I knew it was gonna happen. Kubo purposely set up Kenpachi to face the big bad just to kill him.
CK|GW2: He doesn't even know what his Bankai's name is!:|
CK|GW2: plus, y'know, Bleach could stand to kill off a few dozen characters
can yield interesting results
SuperBrony64: character from Bleach
SuperBrony64: A character from Bleach.
...
Fine
You want SPOILERS
I'll remember this
RAWRity: I expect they are, actually. The first two are confirmed kills.
CK|GW2: I refer you to the tried and true standard: Nobody dies in bleach
oops
Hey superbrony64 i got your message from pinkies4thwall on xbox live dude also i got minecraft for the xbox dude
Oh man, they're still updating Bleach? I got to somewhere in the middle of the dude's with the numbers, in the manga, and I went, "NOPE, I AM DONE."
RAWRity: Granted, no one's said Kenpachi is dead yet, but given that the big bad has his hand jutting through Kenpachi's skull, I'm calling bullshit if he lives
Maybe his skull was made of jello
But seriously, CK|GW2, Don't spoil stuff
CK|GW2: wouldn't be the first time somebody lived through something batshit. Remember Hiyori? SHE WAS CUT IN HALF
CK|GW2: It would be a shame if he died, though.
RAWRity: Yeah, I know.
RAWRity: But it's the final arc, and Kubo's pissed about that. Killing off characters to be petty is within expectations.
hello every one
CK|GW2: Wait, Bleach is ending!?
tigher1001: Hello!
I actually kinda figure this will be Kubo's version of Countdown or Ultimatum.
Hello tigher1001
CK|GW2: Personally, I think Kubo's kind of happy about it being the final arc. It's felt like he's hated his own creation for years now.
Ewww.....why are you playing this game SuperBrony64?
tSparx: Yep.
Mario is overrated.
11,02WindWhistler: :<
:
WindWhistler|School: Becuase it's a good game?
:|
watgeim?
11,02Guess I can't play this anymore cause WindWhistler doesn't liek it ;~;
tSparx: The anime's ended and this manga arc is the last one apparently. Sales are down by millions of copies so Shonen Jump is canning it.
WindWhistler: So you would say he's mainstream?
who is streaming?
What!
AJIsAwesome: If by good you mean "the same thing as in every other game"
No keep streaming SB64
Ignore party pooper
SuperBrony64 of course you can play it.
SB64: Octogirl gaem nao pls
The mechanics are the EXACT same
WindWhistler: Dude...
WindWhistler: EVERY GAME IS EVERY GAME
as in every other game
inb4 WindWhistler is and avid COD fan
WindWhistler: We MAKE it good, not other way around
RAWRity: nope.avi
Now I'm curious *openstream
And always remember, just because something is wellmade, does not mean everyone will like it
We need more Luigi games
WindWhistler: Guess what...
WindWhistler: YOU PRESS RIGHT TO WALK RIGHT
Luigi's Mansion was different.
Wait wait WAIT WindWhistler I have the PERFECT VIDEO FOR YOUR Attitude
Ah, mother was a huge fan of this
Also, Vordox: >implying you were masochistic enough to torment yourself by reading the last arc of a series that stopped being good years ago.
who is streaming
CK|GW2: The manga JUSt came out
Only someone like me is so bold as to torture myself like that. >_>
It's like screaming spoilers of a movie on it's openning night CK|GW2
CK|GW2: What series are we talking about?
Vordox: I think I know what video you're talking about.
AJIsAwesome: Sellout Mario
WindWhistler, you talk about how every game in the Mario series has the same mechanics, as we're watching Mario with a propeller on his head doing super-boosted spin jumps. In my book, I'd call that NEW
Vordox: No, it's like screaming "Bella marries Edward" on the night of Breaking Dawn Part 2's opening
Vordox: Oh. I thought you were talking about the video from Dorkly.
I really, really enjoyed Bleach, and I was worried it was just going to get to Inuyasha levels of "This should've ended years ago."
/me flips a table in a fit of rage
AJIsAwesome: It is
Bella marries Edward?
I thoguht she died
Vivix: almost
Aah
Vivix: What is dead in that movie? =P
I haven't seen the last one
Hehehe, true
Nice job Vordox, you almost made my browser crash with that link
Vordox: Oh.
Oh, bleech, I lost interest inthat series at the filler arc where the Zanbato rebel or something of that ilk.
But Edward turns into a vampire and saves her at the last second for our continued pain
I don't care if the game is mainstream
wat? are we seriously talking about twilight now?
Vordox: The way you titled it sounded like something different.
Aah
Twilight isn't any worse than anyo ther teen movie- so I didn't mind seeing it
that's what i get for fetching me a muffin :P
tSparx: It already did. Really, the Arrancar stuff dragged on too long, if it had concluded faster and ended right there, the series would have been better for it.
AJIsAwesome: It's called Sellout Mario :P
FUN FACT : that witch is actualy a boy
Arrancar, that's the arc I dropped at, yeah.
is anyone excited for dr who saterday
The Hunger games are a teen movie and its 100times better than Twilight
Vordox: I saw it on Youtube as "Mario is too mainstream".
CK|GW2: actually it's more like shouting "This movie is gonna suck for anybody who's not a sexually repressed teenage or middle age girl!" at Breaking Dawn part 2
I like Mario, I like that they trry to make new games with new mechanics, but the recent 2D Super NMario Titles and Super Mario 3D land just look so damn bland... I mean, Good grafics, good sound, but no soul, no personality -.-
In the manga, I never watched much of the anime.
Ihop: oh god i REALY have to catch up
RAWRity: ....point
11,02Bowser Jr. is second worst character in the Mario Universe.
Lil_B: Exactly my point
tSparx: i just read the last chapter. i hope they're gonna make some decent last chapters, and then leave it be
The new games are just the old ones with better graphics
/me Huggles dat SuperBrony64 :3
and one or two new things thrown in
SuperBrony64: then who is the worse?
SuperBrony64: right behind Toad
/me huggles dat Ponies47 back :3
Which get old REALLY fast
oh hai Ponies47
11,02Waluigi
lol
who i streaming this game???
Hi
is
Now Luigi's Mansion...that was something completely different
tigher1001: SuperBrony64.
11,02hai pony_6776 :)
And Super Mario Galaxy was also interesting
Ponies47: Gello!
I want a new Wario game
It provided something new
RAWRity: But yeah, I don't actually know of anyone who reads the series for enjoyment any more. It's mostly just people like me who feel some odd compulsion to know how it ends, even knowing it will undoubtably suck.
tigher1001: SuperBrony64
AJIsAwesome: Thx
*Hello*
Kinda irrelevant to have both Bowser Jr and the Koopalings in this
WindWhistler yes
Hey Barbetos|AtWork freshman only day has my mind so full of buck right now
Infact the recent super mario bros game, with the coins and everything, would of made a better wario game
Now they're just remaking the same old games...
CK|GW2: considering where Bleach has been in the popularity polls the last couple years, it seems that way.
Ponies47: Whoops.:$
Barbetos|AtWork: i really enjoyed the Wario lands
WindWhistler: Dude... Every game is every game =P
Enjoy stuff for what it is, not for what i can be
It's forgivable if the series is only a couple of games
Ohai pony_67.... Gone
Mario games are good
WindWhistler, point taken. But keep in mind that Nintendo has had a lot of anecdotes about how "different" to make a game, especially with everything that happened over Zelda II.
But this series has been around for like...20 years
RAWRity: Yeah, hasn't it lost over a million readers a year since '08 or sommat?
Eli I enjoyed it a lot too. I did not even mind the eye bleeding from the virtual boy I liked it so much
WindWhistler: it seemes like in movies/games there isnt much originality
RAWRity: Arterial bleeds can't match that sort of speed.
There isn't, but there will be at times
One Piece > Bleach
WindWhistler: people enjoy it. You and I don't. We aren't right, they aren't right either.
WindWhistler: any more
Everyone has different opinions. There's always going to be diagreement one way or another.
Just because nothign seems original, does not mean that we shuld accept it
AJIsAwesome: I disagree
CK|GW2: It's lost something like 2 million in Volume sales since 2009, and it's been consistently in the bottom 5 popularity wise cor 18 months, save when it gets a color page.
Hehehe
Hat: *facepalm*
OMG LUIGI'S MANSION 2 PREVIEW!?
CLICK IT SuperBrony64
Ihop: yeah. right now, Fairy tail and One Piece are my favourites
How was Luigi's Mansion 2?
^^
11,02MOOO o3o
moo
Fairy Tail is still somehow worse than Bleach though.
/me glomps SuperBrony64
What about the Luigi's Mansion preview? D:
drum roll
SuperBrony64: You're a duck, right?
/me shoves BronySith out of the way
Eli: good
I've had people recommend One Piece to me but I could never get into the early stuff. When I first tried it was too goofy and out there for me to enjoy proper.
ONLY I CAN GLOMP HIM
dadadaddadaddadadaddadada and its?
/me glomps SuperBrony64
11,02AJIsAwesome: I'm a poneh :D
...
.............
/me hugs WindWhistler back ^-^
oh god
O GOD
Somehow this is even worse than the new Mario games
Du du just dance
Im almost positive that fallout 4 will be set in Boston, it turns out that MIT has a video game department, and a lot of the guys at Bethesda went there. And now Bethesda is known to be researching Boston. Plus "the institute" is based on MIT.
SuperBrony64 don't torture your body D:
CK|GW2: I'm the exact same way.
I'm out for now. Have a funeral to go to
SuperBrony64: Oh, shoot! I was so close.....:D
-_-
perspective*
SuperBrony64, I'm holding a gun to my head
lol
RAWRity: WHAT? fariy tail is so much better than bleach. at least in it's current state
JESmith71: Bye.:(
11,02WindWhistler: ;~;
WindWhistler: good idea
CK|GW2: I love one Piece, but the early chapters are a little uneven between action and goofiness. Until the Arlong Park arc, it's just sort of middling. Plus, it's a looooong read.
JESmith71: God bless, good luck.
Oh yay now we can see Luigi's Mansion 2 preview! :D
bye JESmith71 :(
WindWhistler: Go check the video I linked to you.
My uncle passed on on Sunday
How was Luigi's Mansion 2?
It'll open your minda bit
Vordox: I already told you it almost crashed my browser
RAWRity: No kidding. It would take me forever to catch up.
/me hugs JESmith71
Was Captain planet an anime?
Im never going to do Onepice because i dont want to do something that freaking long. It has like 20 movies for goodness sake.
RAWRity: And given my nick, let's just say my free time is spent elsewhere these days. XD
WindWhistler: If anything, thatll make you think twice before saying the game is the same :P if you get it to work
Bronysith: no
Bronysith: Nope, it's western cartoon
no sith
RAWRity: i think it's worth the read. but i follow OP for almost 10 years now :)
Bronysith: No it was Turner show
Thank you people.
OH SHIT IS ABOUT TO GET REAL
Vordox: That video is just saying Mario is too mainstream. I don't have a problem with mainstream.
OH ANG
Luigi has the worst luck in houses
Luigi!
Fairy tail: All the poor comedice timing of early One Piece, with all the lazy writing of current Bleach!
JESmith71: I wish I could say something, but I can't. He's YOUR uncle, not mine. Sorry. I hope everything goes well.:(
Hat: its a mansion
LM had a sequile!:(
Oooooh new luigi's mansion
CAKE GHOST
LOOK AT THEM REAL GRAPHICS
Rex_Mundi: No, it's *going* to have a sequael
SO AWSOME
This looks epic~
Are those what the ghosts look like?
At least Luigi is the star
Spider is not a ghost!
The fact Luigi is the star makes it more awesome
Or are these Beta ghosts?
Because Luigi needs more love
That ghost looked like hand banana
oh my...
Luigi has more serious adventures
When are you going to buy it, SuperBrony64 ? :D
Ghosts remind me of Worms
LAWl
I wish they didn't make Luigi such a coward though...
Elevator Music
It makes me feel so bad for him...
/me returns with one side of his mouth numb.
11,02Vordox: When it comes out O.O
Silent Hill stairs:D
Poor guy
WindWhistler: Agreed.
WindWhistler: ....Seriously?
OHWOWOWOW
Though the ending of the first game made me laugh
11,02WindWhistler: But if he was not a coward, then Luigi's Mansion wouldn't be as silly and funny :D
WindWhistler: Luigi is Luigi, Mario is Mario, let them be what they are :P
Luigi got his revenge
I NEED A 3DS NOW
/me returns with one side of his mouth numb.
play the pikin tralir
Well I just hate that Mario is getting all the games...
pyrocatboy: We gotcha the first time, Pyro.
What about Luigi?
pyrocatboy: What'd you do? Dentist?
yep
pyrocatboy: don't let dentists take advantage of you.
Oooh what's that Kirby's Dream Collection?
I like Luigi as a coward, but they milk it a little too much. He should really only be a coward in the Mansion games only.
ohohoh new paper mario!!
WindWhistler I'm so looking forward to this!
hey ponies47 remember me? did you miss me?
Yeah his performance in Brawl was pathetic
AJIsAwesome: agreed
WindWhistler: no kidding. who ever plays him in brawl?
I miss the badge system in Paper Mario.
Wii U. Still sounds like a question to me.
Eli: Oh my cousin does. He's amazing as him
Eli: i did ^_^
Luigi isn't a coward, he's a scaredy-cat, big difference! The bravest people are the ones who're terrified, but still do what needs to be done; the biggest cowards are those who aren't afraid, but won't do anything.
I'm pretty sure the badge system is back in the new paper mario
Eli: I was just talking about his single scene where King DeDeDe owned him.
11,02This better come to San Francisco and I better be invited :I
tSparx: True.
nevermind... I'll jsut stay Ike and shut up :P
tSparx: Luigi is just a moron. He has no idea why he breaks into peoples homes.
oh btw i'm back
^_^
WindWhistler it's basicly the first Kirby games (Dreamland to Kirby 64) + some special Stages + a Soundtrack CD + a little Trivia
hey NocturnalBlade
wii u is bad idea
Barbetos|AtWork: Aren't you mistaking him for Link?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9j58lWjwA1rq0gqko1_500.jpg My favioute pic
They were paid to say positive things about t.:P
Ihop: That's what everyone said about the Wii...
WindWhistler: Link knows what he is doing at least. "GET SHINEY RUPEES!"
*it*
ew Nintendo Land
Barbetos|AtWork: But he should be getting sued for millions of rupees
Ihop: I think so too, but mostly I'm just witholding judgement.
For destruction of property
I'm actually pretty excited about the new Wii U.
11,02^
Ihop well, it's new, and it actually has quite the potential, Nintendo is (as they always say, but everybody always ignores it) "We create unique things"
I just want Pikmin 3 and Rayman Legends
MEgAMAN LEGEND
PIKMIN 3
ROCK PIKMIN ARE ADORABLE
'??????
MEGAMAN LEGENDS??
RIP Megaman Legends
tSparx, Rayman
Oh :(
lol
Hey superbrony64 i sent you a message on your xbox dude
Oh hi Perry shirt
I want Megaman Legends 3 so, so baldy.
PIKMIN 3 WII U IS NOW BEST IDEA
they said Rayman Legend
Ihop: We've been waiting for it for years.
tSparx, shame it'll never exist
tSparx: the best we are going to get now is a spirtual successor.
sure have
I heard Capcom is making one big Megaman Collections
Ihop: HECK YES
......Furry Legends....?
CrimsonPhoenix: Never's a long time. A *long* time. Hell, I'm still holding out for a second Threads of Fate, haha.
that sounds wrong...
WindWhistler: yea, furry legends lol
Furies?
Eeeew Rabbids
I'm hoping that, eventually, the gaming industry will be in a spot like hollywood, where they pick up old franchises.
WindWhistler: Ramon rabbids was my first wii game
/me gets the gun out again
then it'll be horrible
tSparx And make shitty remakes?
oh wait nevermind
Because I want Threads of Fate II and Legend of Dragoon II and Megaman Legends 3 and...
well... in 2011 the gaming industrie made more money than the movie industry
We are talking about furries and Rabbids. something tells me that this is about to turn into an admission of a sick fantasy.
Yay, we get to see SuperBrony64 danc- oh wait, nevermind.
Play....Pokemon!
I still can't find my Skylanders game...
pyrocatboy: Well, obvsiously, I want them to do better than Hollywood :P
plz be ssbb
Champion_of_Harmony: All the Pokemon games for the Wii suck.
awwww
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
YES
YEEEEEESSSSSSS
not revolution
Oh yeah in all did I have fun at freshman only day? NO! :[
How was Skylanders? Is it any good?
still good
/me spazzes and foams at the mouth like the foamy mouth guy
AJIsAwesome: It's awesome
chat derp?
11,02I like Skylanders :)
AJIsAwesome: There's another game coming out htis year
AJIsAwesome: i played it once its good
hihi all
and the record for the fasted selling product in the entertainment branche is a game and not a movie :P
Alrighty, as awesome as Rayman O would be, I must depart. Farewell!
Just wanted to know. :)
I'm surprised it got a sequel so quickly...
hai RainbowDash
Ohai RainbowDash!
cool rayman
WindWhistler, it's Activision
bye tSpa...danr it
*darn
*is thinking of getting skylanders for 3ds just for "Dark Spyro"*
Hello Rainb.......
Rayman - a cracked out hyper version of pit fall
Champion_of_Harmony: I wouldn't.
Champion_of_Harmony: Dark Spyro is only different in the 3DS version...and the 3DS game isn't that good...
The console games are better.
dat fairy
hi moopy if you can see me
Can't you attack the sisters?
Why do the faries have huge tits?
NocturnalBlade: Bodacious Nymph
and seriously>
them fairies
Champion_of_Harmony: Cause.
Champion_of_Harmony: They're bodacious nymphs
hey dude
NYMPHS
Why is her face derped?
GET IT RIGHT
DAT DERP EYES
11,02Champion_of_Harmony: Because they are the bodacious nymphs.
/me spazzes
WindWhistler: ah, my mistake lol
i approve of her outfir
what'S this?
/me Pets SuperBrony64
outfit
Champion_of_Harmony, huge tits?
lawl, dat title names
oh, rayman
/me is petted ^_^
I MISS DERPY
SuperBrony64: Won't the nymphs attack you if you attack them?
You haven't seen their hips?
Has anyone played Ocarina of Time the 3ds? How are the controls?
sir derps alot?
SURPRISE, NEW LEVELS
AJIsAwesome: No. They're friendly
SuperBrony64 likes being petted :3
pyrocatboy, they're alright
11,02pyrocatboy: I played it, they are pretty good :D
pyrocatboy: it's good for me.
11,02Ponies47: Moo :3
SuperBrony64: Moo :3
Oh. I heard they would.
right...and are you serious only on 3ds? so even If I had dark spryo and put him on xbox he be regualr spyro?
try backing out and type in your user name
Champion_of_Harmony: No. He'll still be dark Spyro. But his attacks are the same as regular Spyro
ded
On the Wii
SuperBrony64: Oink
But on the 3DS he has a different set of moves
And the 3DS game isn't worth it.
Oh, okay then
Skylanders will probably be the one game I would despise the most
Secret door
CrimsonPhoenix: Because they make you pay to get figures to play the game?
WindWhistler, yes
Furries? Wut.
Eulshy: the food level nymph is even plumpier than the rest :D
What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
CrimsonPhoenix: Considering they're optional...
it's like real life DLC
Well you only need one of each class to access the doors.
for extra characters?
dat dance
You don't need all the figures to beat the game
MadSurge, fat nymphs need love too
Where in other games you can select your characters?
You can just use the three they give you
What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
o.O
CrimsonPhoenix: Hey, at least they have more than ONE character to play as...
There's a wide range of characters to play as...
thats great dude
Eulshy: she's the RIGHT plumpy kind of woman :D
And they already give you three of them.
i think im done bye evrey one
MadSurge, exactly
also Spyro is UGLY AS FUCK
bye tigher1001
lawl @ Moopy
Nother door
What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
but that's my opinion
CrimsonPhoenix: You talking about Beta Spyro or the actual Spyro used?
So I tried taking on the Super Single Line in Pokemon today.
lawl back
Because most people are talking about Beta Spyro...
Beta Spyro?
Back. My internet derped.
CrimsonPhoenix: The picture of Spyro from when the game was a beta.
CrimsonPhoenix: It was horrifying.
Yeah it was
On the second round, got stopped short because Garchomp got killed by Lickylicky's Ice Beam.
ok on September 19th this year Megaman has it's 25th anniverary and there will be a 10CD Soundtrack Collection and more
Facehooves in reply to moopy :P
But he looks a lot better in the Alpha
though I admit I haven't seen the actual spyro now that you mention it
thats great
Hmm or maybe just get a legendary pack for it if I get it...
CrimsonPhoenix: He doesn't look that bad. And he has a nice voice.
Poof
anyway whats yall up to today :D
voice?
Did he really needed a voice?
RainbowDash90: Hello!
was he voiced in the PSX games?
CrimsonPhoenix: Well you can't have them all be silent.
SuperBrony64: Did you get my message?
yes i did
CrimsonPhoenix: Yup.
Has anyone here played RE:Revalations?
Didn't you play any of them?
heeeh guess I can't complain there
I still despise the whole concept of skylanders
optional or not
CrimsonPhoenix: I think it's an interesting concept, even though it's a blatant moneymaking scheme.
11,02AJIsAwesome: Where?
WindWhistler, yeah
I know they just want my money...
But I can't help myself...
blatant money making scheme
/me glomps SuperBrony64
I wantz that game! :O
Because I like the game.
(Yes, I'm kinda cheap using these uber pokemon, but I don't care, as long as they get BP quickly and reliably.)
SuperBrony64: Give me one second.
splish
splash?
HE DIED AGAIN?
/me hugs Bronysith back :D
SB stop dying.
:|
SuperBrony64: Here it is: "Seriously, thank you for streaming this game. This is one of my favorite games to watch AND play.:)"
/me slaps SuperBrony64
is this... rayman?
If you don't stop dying, I'll kill you.
It occurs to me that you need to jump across those enemies to get that coin fingy
Flyboy: Yep.
/me is slapped ;~;
I miss Gex.
OH MY CELESTIA
hey rainbow dash90 what happend?
WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE A NEW GEX GAME!?
11,02AJIsAwesome: :D
nostalgia... destroying... body...
THEY EVEN PUT Q-BERT IN THE NEW PIXAR MOVIE
WindWhistler: You can't really kill someone who's already dead.
SO WHY NOT GEX
AJIsAwesome: that's the point
Gex was annoying
yeah no Spyro is still ugly
WindWhistler: I know.:D
huh only 52 bucks on amazon...but cant decide, skylanders, red dead, portal 2, or dead space?
and that's from watching a lets play on PS3
WindWhistler, That Wrecking Ralph movie?
Any difference between the Wii and 360/PS3 verisons (Yeah I know I said I was leaving but it turns out I have another 10-15 minutes)
must...resist...urge...to find... SuperBrony64's... house...
and Wrecking Ralph ain't Pixar
What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
Marx: Yup
Flyboy: ._.
Flyboy: I already know where he lives. :D
Door
Oy CK|GW2 , you still herE
CrimsonPhoenix: Yes it is.
WindWhistler, They got ALL the big video game characters didn't they? Who's next, Solid Snake? Liquid?
WindWhistler, so Tangled is Pixar as well?
BROTHER!
Marx: They have some big names with VOICE roles
CrimsonPhoenix: Uhhh...yes...
poof
WindWhistler, nope
Oy CK|GW2 =P
I'm exited for Wrek it Ralph even if it isn't Pixar, if the Producer and he Director know what tehy are doing and have a good vision, than I don't fear it :)
Wait so it's just Disney, not Pixar?
Walt Disney Animation Studios
.....................
they turned 3D just recently
I hear the Super Mario galaxy Overtuere
WHYYYYYYYYYYYY!?
Hyped for Wreck too
Lil_B: Agreed. I hope they'll be able to make good jokes about video games in general.

/me sobs
Disney
WHY IS DISNEY GOING 3D?!
DISNEY IS DEAD
WAAAAAAAAAAAAH
/me dies
heh
/me uses Phoenix Down on WindWhistler
is Wrecking Ralph good?
(I'm spazzing out on purpose. I don't actually feel this way)
/me is revived
CrimsonPhoenix we will se when it comes out i believe :(
CrimsonPhoenix: It sure as heck looks good.
hey look a coin fingy
....what about...kingdom hearts? I know that was a good game.
They got freaking Q-BERT in it!
in the ccorner
well what's there to complain
Is stream on?
WindWhistler: The kickbots are staring at your soul
XAX: thanks for the warning.
SirGanjalf: yes
thanks NocturnalBlade
maybe I should see how many kicks I can get in a row...
There's a lot of mods on...
Whaddya say? Should I try?
Not worth it
though I heard Tangled was pretty mediocre
secret door
They have Eggman in it. FREAKING EGGMAN. I'm pretty sure Bowser was a given for that movie, but NOT Eggman.
Oh Rayman
AJIsAwesome: I hear Sonic is also in it.
AJIsAwesome, Robotnik
WindWhistler, woah there
CrimsonPhoenix: Does it really matter at this point?
I heard villains are in
Oh great... my stream keeps buffering
but hero?
I hate this computer
CrimsonPhoenix: Nope, Eggman. It's his modern design.
He's the same person.
LOL FAIL
while Q'Bert is one he's quite old
CrimsonPhoenix: I can't believe people still remember him.
SO WHERE'S GEX AND BANJO AND KAZOOIE?!
AND WHERE'S PARAPPA THE RAPPER?@
/me spazzes
Mario's not in it because it was more expensive than the Bowser cameo
To me he's still Robotnik :D
Comix zone
WindWhistler: One word: Microsoft.
door
Just how much did it cost to get rights from nintendo and sega?
Oh yeaaaah...
I don't think any FAMOUS hero would be in
But where's GEX?!
Gex has been dead for far too long!
WindWhistler: Plus, Nuts and Bolts.
what's the current discustion about?
At least B-K got revived...
QBert is a classic
And Crash. And Spyro
Gex isn't
as much
FUCKING STREAM! Why computer WHY!
CrimsonPhoenix: Darn. You're right.
This will settle it...his name is Doctor Ivo Robotnik aka Doctor Eggman...so either way is fine ^_^
hey number 350
NocturnalBlade: Agreed.
11,02Double kick
NocturnalBlade: Yesh
I call him Doctor Ivo "eggman" robotnik
What bout Ecco the dolphine, those Genesis games are the ultimate unrecognized/unremembered classics.
Spademagnes[R]: good enough lol
Well that was weird
SuperBrony64: "It's Super Effective!"
but seriously from what I've seen
AJIsAwesome and MadSurge thats from the wikipedia page ^_^
no Hero
God damn it stream stop fucking up.... man I need a new computer
Cant wait to see rise of Guardians.
NocturnalBlade: Still, I like that.
just people fan-gasming and pointlessly dreaming of seeing their favorite character so they can fangasm some more
Disney must have a lot of money to spare if they could get so many popular characters in there...
Chun-Li is in the movie.
Isn't she a hero of some sort?
So, I tend to devolpe massive crushes on ponies, and I realize that im OK with that.
And her thunder thighs?
Pic
Rex_Mundi: not alone my friend
WindWhistler: eeyup, Street Fighter lol
would have thought we would be watching the paralympic opening ceremony. oh well
I assume M Bison is in it
I've seen image macros of Wreck-it Ralph. They're hilarious.:D
Of course Vega is in it
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/09/the-familiar-faces-of-wreck-it-ralph
BEST LEVELS
Dat chest
LOOK AT ALL THOSE TRAPS <3
CrimsonPhoenix: See Chun-Li?
I see....
Isn't she a hero?
Rayman Origins?
Is the Wii U out?
well it is a fighting game
My computer has to be broken or something because the stream keeps pausing
SpadeMagnes[R]: Truly, its just so damn easy to fall in love with those ponies.
Stab
and the MAIN hero of Street Fighter are Ryu and Ken
Oh oh! Ken is in there!
And he has a speaking role
WindWhistler, where have you seen that?
Eulshy: who's your fav/least fav pony btw?
So close
CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/19/sonic-street-fighter-characters-confirmed-for-wreck-it-ralph
oooh, Ryu has a speaking role too...
MadSurge Fav is Sweetie Bell, least fav is Rainbow dash
Just to confirm its my shit computer the stream isnt pausing for anyone else is it or lagging?
I got random lags, as well
SpadeMagnes[R]: It's lagging tons here
well fuck me
CrimsonPhoenix: BWA HA HA
Eulshy: glad we agree on the least fav :D
Oh so it isnt just me
Sonic is actually in it
CrimsonPhoenix: What?:O
Lol that was awesome.
but one said it was only rumored
My fav pony at this very moment is rarity, but that changes all the time. My least fav is granny smith, i actually dont like her. Dont care for Snips and Snails either.
But Ryu and Ken do have speaking roles.
Snips and snails are morons
That much we do know~
I have to admit I don't know how to feel about this
CrimsonPhoenix: I knew Eggman was in it, but I'm not sure about Sonic.
11,02:D
11,02Ohai DeathMaidBot :3/
/me is proud that she got CrimsonPhoenix to react.
I AM THE WINNER
Were all those spike really nessicary??
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yes, yes they were.
Lol Rayman is glomping the crystal
is it constantly buffering for you people too?
WindWhistler, you're quite a dick
Rex_Mundi: yep
CrimsonPhoenix: I'm a female so I can't be one of those. :P
Rex_Mundi: yea, from time to time
acting all proud about some trivial thing
CrimsonPhoenix: It was a joke. :{
This isn't Rhythm Heaven :'(
Ok can we all relax here
need more cheast running
Why would I be so proud of something like that?
Thats not how you spell monkey
I think we all need to calm down.:S
I asked that myself
DAT BLINKING
11,02What's going on in here? :I
CrimsonPhoenix: Well now you know I was just kidding.
I ADORE the art style in this game
This game reminds me of earthworm Jim
It is so fluffy!
Yeah
CrimsonPhoenix took something I said seriously so I'm explaining to him.
Okay so we're all on the same page now?
I take everything seriously and at heart when I'm acting serious
Silly Rayman! That's not how you spell Ponies.
Is Foamy the squirle singing in the background?
11,02WindWhistler and CrimsonPhoenix, please stop arguing.
Rex_Mundi: i think so yes
:P
SuperBrony64, kinda late for that
i win the argument
We were arguing? O_o
cause i win
Okay Eulshy, have a trophy
Rex_Mundi: or he is just thinking of something cause it sounds like he is going "ummm ummm ummmmmmm"
and yeah we weren't really arguing
11,02Either way, I said stop it.
WOOOH
Trophy
SuperBrony64: I'm sorry. D:
and we have before you warned us
Will a hug make you feel better?
I'm really digging this background hum
aww
Yikes, I think I just put everyone in a bad mood.
/me slinks away....
Now Rayman is gone
WindWhistler, you haven't really done anything wrong
/me hugs WindWhistler
Oh phew...
I was worried.
its ok WindWhistler you is forgiven ^_^
/me hugs SuperBrony64 back
/me hugs SuperBrony64.
/me hugs Vordox back ^-^
11,02Everypony, hug CCCP :D
/me hugs CCCP
/me hugs CCCP.

There is none :p
Zing!
Chat is slow today.
D:
11,02D:
Also, why do I love Sonic's singing voice in Sonic Underground?
now what?
He sounds annoying normally...but when he sings...
I like it.
Jaleel White?
Oh oh let's watch MST3K
Pleaaaaaaaaaaaase?
king of the hill

/me gives SuperBrony64 puppy eyes
thelonepony: you got stuck sad inside a wall
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
/me holds a gun to her head
I will NEVER sink to that level
nooooooooooo WindWhistler
NEVER
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME WATCH SOUTH PARK
don't do it!!
/me pauses stream
wait south park. i liek
Ewww Comedy Central...
They sucked after they took off MST3K
And this is after MST3K switched to Sci-Fi...
I thouht MSt3K sounded really cool by description, but when I watched it--it was so boring
^
to each their own
Vivix: You probably watched the wrong episodes
I dunno, they were just too long
Woah Skippage
Vivix: Try the short "Johnny at the Fair"
It was some space sci fi movie?
mst3k and rifftrax dont make enough good jokes in the hours they have
I've seen or well, heard quotes, from some of the ones Shizuka streams at times
Is the tsream messing up? It seems like its skiping.
like during HP origina lstream, and yeah not for me I htink
The cast was on a roll in "The Final Sacrifice" and "Space Mutiny"
I might give a short one a chance just in case, so yeah
Vivix: I recommend "Johnny at the Fair" it's only 10 minutes and it's hilarious.
11,02lol
/me writes it down in notepad
is anyone else getting an occasional lag?
guess not.
I'm not on stream atm, moving computer to new desk and tidying up livingroom
11,02Dat 'NOTHING' sing
11,02sign*
all the buffer = :(
^
If you want, you can ask people at http://www.club-mst3k what they would recommend.
so Now they mentioned the buffer..
They're pretty active
aww lag buffer thing :(
<.<
I usually find 150 people watching on that site each day

You guys are trying to tempt me to unpause the stream, aren't you?

Pinkie is bad at reading the mood.
SuperBrony64, something else?

SuperBrony64: I like Princess Celestia...

SuperBrony64, what do you hold against Princess Celestia?
Wow, Past Sins, is bloody epic

/me hugs Moopy
SuperBrony64: what do u mean for nothing?
SuperBrony64: I'm pretty sure that's mostly a full time job

SuperBrony64, what do you expect her to do? Monopolize everypony's lives like the U.S. Government does?
Thanks fro the stream SuperBrony64

my friend bought me the exclusive derpy toy as a birthday gift, and he is neutral about bronies, even though i don't collect the toy >.>
LoGaN!!!! *huggies*
Bronysith: you get out of there!
11,02Nothing, but I'm tired of the ponies writing letters to her in the end of every episode.
bye Michael sleep well
toys
/me Takes what remains of the Of the Princess Celestia plushie back and then gives SuperBrony64 a Luna plushie
hugs?:)
/me hugs LoGaN ^-^
SuperBrony64: but that's the schtick of the show
SuperBrony64 isnt that kinda the entire point of the show
SuperBrony64, fair enough.
Micheal: Night!
/me huggies SuperBrony64 " I like it when they do...:
11,02Princess Luna should be best princess
See u make celestia sad http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/9/29/2ed28db2-8c99-4763-b72a-6d5ab6bcbc45.jpg
Molestia>celestia
SuperBrony64 YES!
/me huggies CCCP back ;A;
SuperBrony64 I LOVE those parts... :'(
Luna best princess
It would be weird if they internalized everything
SuperBrony64: how else can they get awawy with brainwashing the whole town and demoralizing second and fourth best ponies?
For the New Lunar Republic!
Each their own, as always
I could explain why I like Princess Celestia, but I'm not going to bother.
Like.. thought of the lesson learned
AJIsAwesome: it's the plot isn't it? :P
Lunaughty>Molestia
I like Luna a little more than Celestia
Dear Princess Luna today I learned
Nevermind I dunno where I was going with that.
AJIsAwesome, I like her too :3 she's so--kind and calm
Pauly P!
otakon: No. I was kind of being serious.
but anyway, i decided i now want a Nyx plushie
and a luna plushie
AJIsAwesome: lol I was only messin'.
Chrysalis: well good luck.
otakon: Okay.:P
I bucking love Luna! She is awesome! :3
Shizuka: any chance of a rifftrax tonight?
and they shall be all adorable on my desk :D
11,02Dear Princess Celestia, thanks for nearly killing us all multiple times in order to teach us a lesson on something as simple as friendship. Your ex-faithful followers, Mane 6 Ponies.
urk
Luna is a cute plushie
i like Luna, but i still dont understand how people think shes the best character, im alright if they do but honestly shes really not in the show enough
SuperBrony64: :D
simple
LoGaN: ok :)
fanon bullshit
:D
SuperBrony64: gah that reminds me, i keep forgetting about the fluttershy card. i havent forgotten, just a bit bsy, ill do it eventually
SuperBrony64: but they we'ren't killed so eh.
you do realise Luna has far more canon details than celestia
Chrysalis: she does?
we have a whole backstory for luna
Chrysalis im not sure if thats true at all
otakon: im friending you
11,02(P.S. Ordered 6 tickets, only got 2. Will not buy from again.)
we just have shes a princess for celestia
Twiluna is best shipping
SuperBrony64: BUt don't forget the fact that they become stronger from the expierences. Plus, if they didn't go through these things, they never would've been the characters we know and love today.:)
people fluffed up nightmare horse so much that they need to say she's the best character so that the canon version doesn't alter their precious fanon version
I wouldn't be surprised if Derpy Hooves accrues more screentime via cameos than Luna did in the 3 episodes she appeared in.
LoGaN: okay...
hi
Kandarihu|OldComp: well BG's do not count
otakon yeah. "Luna Eclipsed' shows more of Luna than the entire series shows of Celestia
Celestia shouldn't meddle in the business of mortals, her backing off kinda makes sense
if they ever make another NMNight episode i wanna see Luna in Sheperd's armor :D
11,02AJIsAwesome: Obviously not, Rarity still acted spoiled even after learning her lesson.
you know what
i just want more ponies
SEASON 3 SEASON 3 SEASON 3 SEASON 3
^
Canadian_Brony: well true, that's she's a serious, if slightly out of touch character that does know how to have a good time.
season 3?
/me repeates BUCK chant
Chrysalis: soon
SuperBrony64: Suited for success?
aw but i wub Rarity
just imagining luna and twilight kissing eachother as they share their saliva covered mouths together as sweat drips around their warm fur as luna slowly kisses down twilights neck ever closer to her....Im sorry what was i talking about?
Bronysith: :S
Rarity is the only character that i personally think is slightly complex but im not sure if its all intentional
Bronysith: ... the HELL
SuperBrony64: wheres me stream
night guys
hi hi hi hi hi
Bronysith what fic is that
11,02Stream is over with :<
i mean
erm

/me sits on otakon s head with a muffin
otakon: YOU DONT SAY
haha
i like the twiluna ship even more than otakon x _____ ships
they are soooo cute
whoever linked that spanish flea video a few days ago, i salute you again
/me hugs CCCP and appologizes for being a dick
hmm
LoGaN tanks C:
is that still a rule
meep
twilight_sprinkle: spanish flea?
Bronysith he doen't say. He typed that. If he said it, you wouldn't hear it.
or can we give otakon to UPS again?
...
NO
twilight_sprinkle lol why?
no its not a rule?
I am not getting shipped with everything in God's green Earth again.
otakon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxbSRpVJ3s&feature=watch_response i can listen to that song for hours
/me admits hes a big dick everypony so make fun of me while you can!!!!!!
CCCP: its a very fun song :D
11,02I mean, just think about it, she complains about boasting in Boast Busters yet boasts when she has her wings in Sonic Rainboom.
twilight_sprinkle: oh that
Is there still a stream?
SuperBrony64: I don't know
CCCP: no
oh!
SuperBrony64: the show lacks consistency my brother
please no more shipping. I'll end up as the new otakon
She does, and that's why many people like Trixie
ty otakon
Shizuka! Are you there oh mighty Pyro?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Uz1icjwrM
man i LOVE this harmonica tune,kinda sad http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWzHLpM2DZg
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6f5Dz19Bk&feature=g-vrec
It's not a consistency error rather than a show of doublestandards, which is common
^
claming it is cont. error is simpsons league nerdery
So stream is over..... :'( Random video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewDMPLRvzl0
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZMjFC_RgY
11,02I'd rather write letters to Princess Luna
mlp isnt really That good story and character-wise
I like it- because- everyone have traits that they might need to improve, but might not be able to
Vivix but no one likes trixie as much as Meanwhile
11,02Dear Princess Luna, HAI :D Your faithful follower, SB
Hehe
but the characters are pretty good in terms of relatibility, if thats a word
yeah-
11,02Dear SB, Ohai :3 Your faithful princess, Luna
SuperBrony64: ALL HAIRU ZE SONAR REPABRIK!
I like the stories, because they feel like a story rather than a presinium sketch like many cartoons
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkhCNx-8Qos
^^
but I am- that cartoon fan, I don't like anime, I don't like sketches-
who here would chooose celestia over luna?
i dont understand what people have against clop or r34 in general i mean, some of the greatest art in history is R34, nude statues, paintings of nude people etc, its not like it is pedophilia or necrophilia, not having sex with children or dead bodies, in fact some of the art looks really good
well- dependso n the sketch
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu1UiaENGBg
remember that porn and nude art is two different things
yes
Vivix: yeah most little kids cartoons are pretty bland
it said my nick was in use
"Dear Princess Celestia, today my father taught me the magic of shaving... it hurts like a bitch and I'm going to have to end up doing it for the rest of my life."
but still nudity is a no-no
CCCP: WHY YOU LISTEN TO EMO MUSIC?!
umm
im back check this out everypony :) http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/when-you-are-crossing-the-street-and-someone-honks-at-you-to-hurry-up.gif
I have noothing against clop, nooooooothing, but I never try to- justify it? It's not worth arguing about
Bronysith i actually like all music :3
StinkomanFan don't worry. After 3 or 4 you get used to it and don't get nicked as often.
if at all
Bronysith: nudity is different from R34, which is LITERALLY pornography of character that were NEVER meant to be in pornography.
i think i know but he would hate me if i said why Bronysith
CCCP: but my chemical romance is pure emo music, no wonder you think the way you do
guys
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZMjFC_RgY
I'm a clopper
/me quickly hides behind something
*gasp*
/me slowly claps
Bronysith i still liek them and dont care what other people think :3
clopper :P
Many of us are, but there's no realy reason to bring it up in a pg chat, or try to turn people into accepting it when they should just tolerate it
CCCP: they put messages into your mind, make you want to feel bad
I'm a clopper too
exactly Vivix
I for one
Well now LoGaNs, you see, that's an example of a compeltely shitty in all aspects remix
am a person of many weird fetish
Bronysith -_- then how come i feel happy when im listening to them?
Buytoast: aww depression
oh, are we talking about our fetishes now?
and MLP is just one thing from the many stuff that....well turn me on
get comfy, this is gonna take a while
and this conversation stops now XD
oh boy
With how feral furries are becoming more normal, that's not really a weird thing
lol agreed NocturnalBlade
yeah we should stop before it gets out of hands
especially after Pokemon, feral porn --became more abundant
Chat talks about fetish ಠ_ಠ
<,<
i'm not too surprised
it was only a matter of time
-_- i think it already has CrimsonPhoenix
I love the psychology side that studies this, you know- but it's not really fit to discuss here
I have no opinion on this topc.
Bronysith also i dont think youve ever listened to one of their songs, its like in the 50's when older people thought that rock and roll made theire kids go crazy
Can we please move on?
just remember though, while you don't enjoy looking at an R34 pic, there's nothing really wrong to it and there's nothing really bad for one to use it for personal pleasure
and 60's
I am done with that
I thouht MCR was emo bull, but then I listened to it and enjoyed it imensly
it never ends
CCCP: THE GENRE IS LITTERALLY EMO
SuperBrony64: preety plz
11,02Please limit the R34 and Porn talk please :)
MCR ROX :D
thank you
SuperBrony64: yes aniki
SuperBrony64: Thank you.
SuperBrony64, I am being carefull don't worry
make a channel for em
I like MCR, just a couple songs though
Bronysith, the genre emo is not really MCR, man. Emo is like.. Death cab for cutie, and is beautiful
^
Bronysith it is? Is that supposed to make me hate them?
CCCP: never said to make you hate them. BUT THEY ARE GENRED AS EMO
have some Whose Line http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4uUsZD-GOQ
Emo is a fairly clean 90s genre, MCR is more--pop punk with elements of emo, and a lot of their stuff is really really good
Bronysith but why do i care?
now if you want SAD deppo music, listen to Codeine or LOW, sadcore is amazing
i like music that sounds good dont care if fucking adolf hitler made it
if someone wants to see a cute pic, please pm me
brb, I have chores to do.
CCCP Totally
it isnt r34, but GODDAMN SUGGESTIVE
well i would still think its fucking creepy if he made it but still
Like Burzum
I can't listen to that without shuddering
Neo nazi murdere who tried to blow up a church
i like Final Fantasy OSTs
ofcourse, the music is pretty bad, so I don't have to listen to it
this is for all the mlp fim lovers http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/when-you-hear-the-intro-of-your-favorite-tv-show.gif
DJ_POn-3 nah i dont think any of them are here
DJ_POn-3: a'wwwww

otakon: can i please murder those parents?
Bronysith: yes, and send the child to a decent foster family STAT!
DJ_POn-3, <,< I've done that
DJ_POn-3: I've danced a bit before but not that
otakon: u did see what the shirt said right?
chat needs more fluttershy
Bronysith: yes :(
yay!§
makes me sad
what did the shirt say?
otakon: "I wonder why my child got raped by that ugly old guy"
otakon: if that child gets raped i will not be surprised if the parent says this
thats just not right :|
well none the less I hope that doesn't happen
what Sketch_Toku_Brony said
oh man, from fetishes to rape
i hate this when it happens :( http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/when-you-dip-your-cookie-into-the-milk-for-too-long-and-it-breaks-off.gif
still not surprised
13Stop.
13Now.
I wonder why I never visited here before.
It's a serious discussion, not a joke
Hi TheLivingTombstone!
TheLivingTombstone: you the real thing?
13This is not the place for this kind of discussion.
well the conversations we have here would probably be the reason XD
Bronysith: Yes.
13Take it elsewhere.
:o
Super castlevania 4

Your going to have to wait on that story, Bronysith!:)
TheLivingTombstone: Your song "Good Girl" is just. AMAZING! I can't stop listening to it!
TheLivingTombstone: im listenning to discord
Fuck! I'm supposed to be moving shit
Wow

TheLivingTombstone: righto, just give me a private message some time
DJ_POn-3: i got Discord on Rock Band...play the hell outta it

Thank you very much Ponies47

I'll believe it when I hear some proof
TheLivingTombstone your one of my favorite artists, even outside the fandom

CCCP: *you're
Thank you CCCP

Aww, Buytoast is trying to troll again. How cute!:)
13Refresh your embeds please.
13And be respectful.
hey, i'm asking questions
He's not a troll, he's just cranky
You rule Tombstone!
TheLivingTombstone: anser Buytoast
and he's ignoring them
TheLivingTombstone i really liked your song Magic,the girl voicing Trixie was spot on :$
dat l4d
I've never heard a tombstone song, so I can't really say anything
TheLivingTombstone: faaaaake
which i find funny as all hell
Shizuka dos that mean theres a stream?
refreshed
crap my soundcloud is full.... rubbish
Sketch_Toku_Brony: i liked Magic too, one of my faves
Buytoast: How do I make my crap delicous? I try adding some sugar.
seems legit
Oh, Dead island. Isnt this that game that, when the trailer hit, everyone thought it was going to be this powerful story with characters you care about, but then it diddnt turn out to be that at all.
This l4d1?
wut?
Rex_Mundi, yup-
TheLivingTombstone: may I dance on your head?
everypony see this :P http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/when-your-mom-said-bring-me-my-purse-and-ill-give-you-some-money.gif

Dance away, DeathStar.
everyday Im shuffling
/me dances on TheLivingTombstone s head :3
Maybe I should pour some sugar on my shit too then. i could always do with more praise
but you still haven't answered my other question
how does one expand their soundcloud space?
/me sets TheLivingTombstone on fire
DJ_POn-3 thats a classic!
ikr
What was your other question, Buytoast?
Why did you ruin that song?
Ha I remember seeing that Batman movie
I know the question is universal, but that Discord song.
Which song did I ruin for you Buytoast?
pills here PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPilspils
Whos streaming now?
There was a discordsong?
TheLivingTombstone: you mean what song livingtombstone ruined
TheLivingTombstone: so u ended up here after all
Well, Buytoast, you may not like that song, but many others do.
omg this to funny http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/when-you-eat-too-many-skittles.gif :P
I appreciate your opinion though!
so ummm is there a stream?
i didn't ask what others thought though
Did anypony see the interview with Andrew WK on Conan? the one that involved him talking about pinkiepie?
l4d sounds... different from what I remember
would you answer instead of redirecting?
DJ_POn-3: comsume the rainbow, throw up the rainbow
Rex_Mundi, I'm gonna try to catch it when it airs here, used to be a big Conan fan
yes exactly
TheLivingTombstone: you still never told me how long it took you to beat ninja giaden 2
i love you Buytoast
who is streaming and who is said streamer playing as?
G'night everypony! :)
Buytoast, I do not think I ruined the song. It is YOUR opinion that I 'ruined' it.
13sec
Zoey is favorite
night GilDash
hey everypony

Night GilDash!
JRP: you do realize its not the real livingtombstone right? no one could automatically know how to ping someone first getting in here

Barbetos: i like Fransis
Bronysith, many people have used IRC for many many years, it is universal
hey there AJIsAwesome
I'm asking WHY you did, not what MY opinions mean to you.
Bronysith they could of used other IRC chats before
I don't think it's real either, but that is no proof
if you can't answer just admit you can't answer.
Because I wanted to, Buytoast.
hey there Vladmir
there you go
Buytoast you dont need to be hostil to a guest
now was that so hard?
What are you doing SuperBrony64?
'sup
http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/whensomeonetries-to-steal-your-food.gif
11,02Vivix|Awai: Setting a ban.
/me is too curious
hey, i wasn't trying to be hostile, i was trying to get an asnwer
SuperBrony64: ban?
http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/when-you-finally-think-life-is-going-great.gif
I'm trying to see on who, but--I guess none my business
if i was a mod, all day long id ban you all!
I'm back
Wait, who is baned?
flash crashed on me
hai otakon ^-^
JRP: We don't know if this the real TheLivingTombstone.
Buytoast, the question is unanswerable, because the motivation is..unrelated to the result
CCCP: Then when the mods came back they return the favor
probably that guy that was imitating TLT
CCCP why :'(
I don't think you would be a mod for long CCCP
Ohai AJIsAwesome
Ponies47: Hello!
CCCP: if you were a mod then half life 3 would have been released, hell freezes over, EA stops being greedy, Cuba becomes a republic,
i know :3 i just have an obession with banning bots
I'm back
CCCP: so you can never be a mod
Bronysith: Cuba is a republic
Bronysith you could of just said when pigs fly so i could think of a come back...
Rex_Mundi: try communists
otakon: Welcome back!
pfft, Communism
bugger all flash crashed on me
I blame Firefox 15 update
They are republic though, aren't they? Socialist or not
Communism 4th best thing on earth
either that or Ant Video Downloader
otakon: why not the tonberries i set into your net?
Bronysith: bc those things creep me out!
Marxism 3rd best waaaay better than communism
Communism doesnt imply non-democracy. Republic doesnt have to = democracy.
CCCP Then bacon at third, maple syrup at second, and Ponies at #1
huh same thing happened to me not long ago
Socialism is beautiful
Biglaw lol
Is someone dissing democracy?
I thought politics weren't allowed
becuase when you diss democracy...
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Flash crash after Firefox 15 update?
any way hi! Biglaw *glomps*
CCCP : Socialism
YOU DISS MURIKA
Socialism is democratic
/me huggles CCCP back
otakon yep but its working fine now
Viper socialism is overrated
Political discussions never end well.
And i won;t have no commie turrists diss MURIKA on my watch!
lol
CCCP : Its a good idea
WindWhistler: it's still a Republic
We're part socialist, but not enough, dentist still too expensive for many
All republics are somewhere on a scale of Oligarchy on one side, and true Democracy on the other. Its a sliding scale.
still we're getting off that point
otakon: a DEMOCRATIC republic.
OKAY NVM!
Ireland is a Republic
well whatever
ENOUGH!
Back to RiffTrax
next talk of Politics gets banned
TheLivingTombstone sorry about Buytoast
"Quick head for that mansion!"
/me buries WindWhistler alive
WindWhistler: it's on?
TheLivingTombstone...
We are a folkestyrt monarki, which is democratic monarchy
/me holds back an otakon shipping
Its okay CCCP.
:kickcount otakon
goddammit
Cuba is a more oligarchic republic, but USA isnt a true Democracy either.
otakon: Nope. I'm watching somewhere else
I ain't sorry
why is everypony so angry right now? :C
Rex_Mundi, communism only takes the form of all the power falling to a small oligarchy. It only carries the banner of democracy but it never stays like that.
otakon you missed it last night, I did a you!
you can say it all you want
politics
and nno rifftrax
CCCP: Because we have angry eyebrows attacking
jeebus you guys are chatty today
Hehehe
WHERE ARE YOU LARRYBOY?!
otakon erm... no reason XD
WindWhistler :o
hai Panda
I'm supposed to be doing stuff! Where's Jmo when I need a poke
WindWhistler: XD
Larry Boy!
I should get back to working on a song. Goodbye! :)
/me hugs CCCP
Kandarihu: Depends on what you meen by "Communism", it has a different interitatipns and meanings
I am that hero!
bye TheLivingTombstone!!! <3
it;'s because some remixer guy is in teh chat and everyone wants to be acknowledged by him and feel fulfilled
CCCP :D
I'll kiss whoever gets what I'm talking about.
/me huggies Vivix|Awai
because it'll be the greatest moment in their lives
see ya TheLivingTombstone!
Very few people acknowledged him Buytoast
like..4 guys?
and I'm guessing no one recognized what I was talking about?
wait- more, but wahtever
Larry Boy?
don't need to acknowledge him for him to see your name
cya TheLivingTombstone! /) :$
ded?
the cucumber?
WindWhistler: Larry boy is in veggie tales >.>
Well, just because some guy walks in here I'm not gonna stop talking
TheLivingTombstone: YOU FAKER
Rex_Mundi, not really. There is a specific manifesto outlining the standards of communism, and its not anything that any sane person would want.
cya Tombstone!
laugh laugh laugh
Biglaw: ABOUT TIME SOMEONE GOT IT
bye TheLivingTombstone
i sometimes takes cheese graders and rub them against trees
CCCP: why?
Because of that emote though I'm not gonna kiss you.
>_>
lol why?
/me is dejected
They need to make a proper sandbox zombie game
otakon cus cthulhu
Depends, you are refearing to maxist communism. There are other types of communism/communalism. Libertarian comunism, religious comunism, anarchist comunism, etc...
where you explore a huge city looking for supplies then defend your fort at night
lowfn WHY did you trick people in to thinking your tombstone?!
I'm back everypony. What did I miss in the last 3 hours?
unless its cuz trees are GRATE *ba dum tish* ...i got nothing

Ponies47: It wasn't the real tomstone
Shizuka: Not.
Ponies47: it wasent him
Shizuka i am
As it is, with comunism/communalism, if everyone from Jesus to Stalin can be called a comunist, then its obviously an ill defined word!
i'm watchin Shizuka
Shizuka: I am

CCCP: life IS a box of chocolates
BTW, Rand Paul is speaking right now at the GOP convention
Bronysith it doesnt last long for fat people
/me revives CCCP with phoenix down
"Yolo" is the "carpe diem" for stupid teenagers
CCCP: that is a terrible joke
Canadian_Brony: yup
who have no care for actuall and useful sayings
CCCP: that was great\
umm
im not original, youd think id actually make a joke? come on this is 2012
how is carpe diem meant to be pronounced?
WITCH
dammit all!
/me puts a tonberrry on the witches head
CCCP: i never heard it
Shizuka is a girl? Thats cool.
Comedy is forbidden here.
So is fun.
BronyInstrumental: "Car" "Pay" "Dee" "Umm"
damn it louis
Oh, he's done now. I should've mentioned that right when he started.
quiet toast
AJIsAwesome: thanks. i never knew how to pronounce that, so i never used it IRL :$
/me trots all around the room
Buytoast if the "real" LivingTombstone was here would you really act like that to him?
probably
Shizuka: what's the name of the new witch theme do you know offhand?
he's nothing special
*Puts a saddle on Pearly and locks him in the stable*
nobody is
chat derp?
Buytoast sure is the optimist.
Buytoast well he makes music that some people like
Buytoast: <3
these days, why are freshmen so stupid?
/me sets a tonberry next to CCCP
VladmirMakarov they always were get over it
Freshmen have even not been stupid?
/me she is locked in a stable "Poor Pearly"
Zoey has a crazy laugh
anybody can make something someone else likes
Does anyone know that new music for the Witch?
I like it
So add 3 more rounds to the 90+ rounds I have to win to get all the TMs.
Not everyone likes the same things. That's a natural fact of life, but you should never insult someone who likes what they like.
i mean these days they're even stupider than normal
Bronysith it should have been a wild thornberry
And other crap I'm rambling on about.
for once, i actually agree with Buytoast. just because someone is good at something doesn't mean you should act towards them any different than you do others
CCCP: you obviously have no idea what a tonberry is you prick
VladmirMakarov eh not really
CCCP: that was in no way clever
CCCP: just showed your ignorance
http://tinyurl.com/9rrkonn I'm D'awwwwwwwwww here! :D
Bronysith i wasnt trying to be i honestly dont know what that is please tell me
Bronysith: may i ask what a tonberry is?
CCCP: i think it's a final fantasy enemy
CCCP: exactly, ignorance
I dont know what a tonberry is either :D

RainbowDash90: Shizuka

YAY SHIZU!
RainbowDash90 Shizuka
This isn't eSpaghetti, the world's only brony dating site.
Hi everyone. I'm new here and I like biscuits.
haha is there a such thing?
hehe playing left for dead for the computer?
i don't like you
Pegasister? Geez i hate that term :D why not just female brony.
but i do like biscuits
Hi BileGraze. Welcome to random plus stream. But mostly random. And stream.
13no i'm playing left 4 dead for the toaster
O.o
RaveBrony: same here. why not just call them all bronies regardless of gender?
I like to play the toaster
BileGraze: hi and welcome to..um what Canadian_Brony said ^_^
NocturnalBlade random plus stream. But mostly random. And stream.
There's enough ofa pushback against that term that I think we can safely just forget it.
BronyInstrumental: yea, bronies can be genderless
Hi Canadian_Brony, and NotcturnalBlade. I had a cupcake today.
oh great...
hi BileGraze
BileGraze: Hello!
hi
/me hugs BileGraze
I had a bran bar
BronyInstrumental: My thots exactly, but CapFS was asking for a pegasister, so 'female brony' would just be used in that situation :P
RaveBrony: arewerite or arewerite?
Hi friends. Now I'm gonna go have a pepsi.
BileGraze: Be sure to read the rules and I hope you have a great time here.:)
I will have the most amazing time that anyone has ever had in the histroy of having a great time.
Welcome Bile
0,5>>
ohai BileGraze didn't see u there
0,5<<
0,5ew
some female bronies prefer brony, some pegasister, and I've seen them go either way. It's a matter of opinion.
I like the term pegasister, to me, its just a nickname for female bronies, so i dont get the hate torwards it.
BaconMane what is it?
Canadian_Brony: True
BaconMane: What is it, BaconMane?
hi BaconMane. There was something I was going to ask you, but I can't remember now . . .
0,5I read "Bile"
People dont read the rules here, they just get on and start being idiots.
0,5eew
Rex_Mundi people hate almost anything for any reason
Ewww, BaconMane.
BaconMane: Don't be so mean...:(
/me hugs DashWithRainbows
Bile?
AJIsAwesome, how did you make that little Twilight face? O:
Being male, i dont really have a right to choose what to say. Females decide what to use of their own accord :D
well some of their oppinon is wrong Canadian_Brony
Rex_Mundi: see, i can see it that way too. i use the term only towards people who either don't mind or want to be called it. i mean, "brony" is a nickname anyway
0,5Bile as in, like, stomach
how are you DashWithRainbows
RaveBrony: so true lol
The word pegasister, I can't put my finger on the problem with that term. Maybe I will later on.
Oh, hi.
Ihop nobody can have a "wrong opinion".
BileGraze: There's a little smiley face icon. Click on that and you be able to access some emoticons.
o:
it is of my oppinon that they can Canadian_Brony
Oh, thatnks you.
CCCP Had a long, long walk and talk with a close friend for a nice portion of today, so pretty good. How about yourself?
BileGraze: that or just type the corresponding symbols. try putting the o in o: in fron of the :, and youll get a pinkeh
6_9
yayyy
Yeah, I see. :D
Ihop perhaps you would be so kind as to explain how someone can have a wrong opinion?
in your opinion, that is
DashWithRainbows it was alright not much happend thank you for asking :)
if they dont agree with mine that to is an oppinon
To me, 'Brony' is 'Brother pony' rather than 'Bro pony', because who wants to be assossiated with "bros"? And dont even start to sugggest "/b/ronies".
:o
No opinion is inherently wrong unless it is based off of wrong information
Yay.
WITCH!
lol /b/ronies
Braza pony
Rex_Mundi: Agreed.
Comrade pony!
Otakon, your opinions are wrong plenty of times.
Shizuka: what is that new music box music for the withc?
IMIGalil_Nyan: no no no, not if based off of fact. and who are you?
Can the guy who's playing see our comments? Cause, like, this is live?
otakon eeyup. It playes near witches IIRC
Canadian_Brony: it must be newer
dumbass set off the witch alone
ah
BileGraze: it's Shizuka and she can
otakon: Who else would have a gun in their name since they were too lazy to remember their regular name's password?
:)
I don't play L4D
but /b/ is where the term brony comes from
K, thank you otakon.
BileGraze: yeah if she/he has the page or chat program open in a different window
IMIGalil_Nyan: I don not know.
Thanks you for da information.
[7:00:25 PM] Ponies47: I'll brb. My computer is fucking up again -_-
np
otakon: Grimlock/SweetieBot
Whoops forgot to take the Skype stuffout :$
*eating sweat potatoe pie*

IMIGalil_Nyan: the hell I'm not familiar with that many guns how would I recognize that?
co>b
Buytoast: We left that dark place long ago.
no you haven't
:D :P :(
ponies still shit up the board everyday
There are many different theories on where the term "brony" came from. I honestly couldn't are which theory it is, so I'm going with "Brother pony".
i like /wsg/
*care*
Buytoast: So does furry porn and gifs of annimals getting thrown off bridges
The term brony was coined by a fan on /co/ before the fandom even left 4chan.
0,5i liek /wtf/
Reloading! :[
i liek /sex/
BaconMane reddit isnt that good
actually not that many animal abuse gifs on /b/ these days
people don't like em
0,5CCCP: i wouldnt know, dont tell me
IMIGalil_Nyan: True. I saw that.
THERE IT IS!
Buytoast -_- please dont talk about this stuff it one of the reasons i hate the internet
goddammit WHAT is that music name?
i don't go on reddit or 4chan. both are just forums i'm too lazy to read. TL;DR
Not that there is anything wrong with sf or anything...
Never been on reddit, what it like?
^
:);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[6_9>_><_<lool random wmotioncons ^_^
Reddit is alright
overused joke after overused joke
weird
BaconMane: THE HELL
BaconMane: WHAT LANGUAGE?
RainbowDash90: dont spam emotes.
that's reddit
i go to reddit for news
i only like the /r/mildyinteresting
I was a newgrounds user, so yeah...
SHENANIGANS!
Hi again people.
I CALL SHENANIGANS ON BaconMane!
0,5You said "hell"
0,5thats a bad word
hi BileGraze. Did you leave
BaconMane: :|
?
Yeah, for a little bit.
*Anyone*
how many times has otakon been kicked now?
hell hell hell hell
0,5It's just a joke otakon
BaconMane: it's in bad taste
:kickcount otakon
BaconMane he didn't say it. He typed it. If he said it, you would never hear him.
honestly /b/ was never good nor was it funny at all, in fact basically any one who went on there back in 2005 doesnt go on anymore so who gives a shit?
JRP said a bad word. O:
0,5yes i would
0,5I have
AJIsAwesome: Berrypunch isn't on
0,5super hearing
BaconMane: you just like banning otakon
but
brb
Ihop: I only got kicked
otakon: I know now.
jeze that wasent necisarry who ever kicked me its called boardem
BaconMane . . . :D
it's true, /b/ is shit these days
BaconMane, Hell is the name of a terrible place.
I don't know why I find that funny
Everyone likes kicking otakon. Especially when he's down.
but I do
it's also a place in Sweden IIRC
0,5RainbowDash90 watch yourself
^
-.-
-_^
making a point dude
0,5take your boredom somewhere else not here spamming
Shizuka: I found it finally
Okay, back again.
0,5your point isnt very pointy
permaban him
RainbowDash90: if you're gonna rant at the mods, at least spell things right, and use punctuation!
he's ignoring direct orders
it's actually Alma's music box theme
you wont win against mods. Youll be gone long before you can make a point :D
#bordem
dont start
...
advertising
you spelled it wrong Ihop
he's talking back
quiert
Can the play, Shuzuki, or whatever his/her name is, type?
it's "boredom"
Chat derped on me
the only good thing that ever happend to /b/ was the justin beiber to Norht Korea prank and /fur/day massacre and of course the tome green prank
player*
yom*
tom*
can we please stop talking about 4chan?
also lol
no
CCCP- how was the /fur/ day masacre good?
I wish Chuck Norris was here
Chuck Norris doesn't simply "come here"
otakon awww but i like 4chan
no one does
lol
0,5Chuck Norris jokes are stupid
pfft, 4chan
4chan aint that bad
Buytoast: it is the Mos Eisley of the interent
internet*
Im never going bad to 4chan, the things i saw cannot be unseen...
*back
i mean "Oh man, 4chan! Obviously it's all CP and stuff that I've heard it contains!"
BaconMane jokes are stupid :I
It's the most wretched hive of scum and villainy you'll ever find.
Rex_Mundi okay sorry i personally thought it was funny, but thats just me, im alright with furries but honestly couldnt they have their oen site?
not really
otakon: I agree
I'm indifferent about the Chuck Norris jokes.
there are far worse places
4chan sucks thats all i have to say about it
BaconMane: IMIGalil_Nyan is RX-78
I generally stay away from the bad parts of 4chan. The only go to /c/ and /g/ for the most part, and I watch my step on /f/
BaconMane: correct one of the rules of the interntes says "if you make chuck norris jokes you are a newfag, no exeptions" (im not kidding)
/me 0,5has never been on 4chan :D
do itt!
BaconMane agreed. He's a washed-up has-been who receives to much praise. I'm surprised to hear Chuck Norris stuff around my school still. Just kicking a dead horse.
Buytoast: yeah but at least those places TELL you they are far worse and for that express purpose of being far wors
now
its not worth going on Bacon
0,5Naaw
Im so lost with these "/?/" things :D
no pun intended
Has anyone here ever bought a Rainbow Dash plushie? And I don't mean the really crappy ones that look like crap. I'm talking about a perfectly made plushie that resembles RD in every way. Sadly the high priced ones.
0,5RaveBrony best to not get involved with what theyre talking about
enope
RaveBrony: sections on 4chan
RaveBrony /be/
I like the show but I don't buy merch
brb
BileGraze: No. But I know people who have.:D
BileGraze I've seen alot, but either they were too damn expensive or not for sale.
BaconMane: I shall not then :D
0,5I hear 4chan isnt good so i avoid it as best i can
If only they wearn't so overpriced...
CCCP- all the /fur/ day masacre do is ensure that the only kind of furry art that gets put on 4chan is of the erotic kind, and everyday huge threads of it pop up and grow large before it gets deleated. Its why the 4chan term "furry fryday" exists.
otakon: mlp merch?
/c/=Cute (generally G rated stuff) /g/=Technology /f/=Flash
smart thinking bacomnmane
0,5Fryday?
Rex_Mundi: what's the /fur/ day massacre?
*friday
But, why can't Hasbro just make a Rainbow Dash Plushie. IT would probaly look just like the really high priced ones.
i get my porn from 4chan
._.
it's a good place to go
And only be like $20.
Rex_Mund honestly i didnt know furries liked anthromorphic creatures for any other reason than sexual ones, but thats just me being ignorant
BronyInstrumental: They gave the furries their own bord, just to deleate it and ban everyone who posted in it.
beautiful
BileGraze: The recent ones ive seen in Walmart are decent considering theyre only lik $12
CCCP, not all furries. The term applies to people who aren't even perverts.
BileGraze the main problem with RD plushies is she's the most detailed from the Mane 6. Her mane and tail are 12 unique pieces altogether, and then there's her wings to consider.
D:
come on it was still funny!
Rex_Mundi: okay. i won't join the 'furry' debate because my IRL best friend is a furry, and he's pretty important to me, so i try my best not to argue about it anywhere
I could donate. :)
CCCP: no it was not
BronyInstrumental: Same here! (\
So they have enough money to afford all da stuffing and stuff.
Kandarihu i didnt know
BileGraze I've seen a Gala RD plushie that went for over $2750. It was really detailed, though.
I dont mind furries, the ones ive met are Very nice people.
RaveBrony: /) we seem to have a lot in common >.>
I'll try to find it for you
Are you kidding me?...
no
I'll find it
$2750...
0,5Who the fuck
0,5would pay that much for a plushie
BronyInstrumental: :D
Bronysith i found it funny, not because that it happend to furries but just because that it was a successful prank
a brony BaconMane
BaconMane: We would.:D
RaveBrony, you're basing your opinions on personal experience. That's good.
BaconMane take a look at ot http://www.tomopop.com/this-is-a-2-275-handmade-rainbow-dash-plush-22369.phtml
nearly 3K for a plushie?
really?
3k for a doll
BaconMane: britannia was auctioned off at BUCK for £1000, a lot of cash but nowhere near $2750 so i don't know :D
so pathetic
Kandarihu: :$
$2275*
^
BronyInstrumental: Don't get me wrong, but why are you bringing this up again? You know where this got us last time.
/me once went to a store saw rainbowdash toy wanted to buy it, but had no money :'(
Aw D:
ah, 2k
/me pussied out
ugh
They are all fuzzed about that when it's normal?
that's barely more reasonable
AJIsAwesome: bringing what up?
0,5Yeah, uh.... that's not worth $2000 +
CCCP when I did see one, she was a brushable, which makes her look G3.
CCCP: you dont need to say that in RP form, just say you pussied out, not in /me format
Bronysith: Don't get me wrong, but why are you bringing this up again? You know where this got us last time.
I buy my pony merch with pride :D
0,5Even if it's physically worth that much, it's not mentally worth it
BronyInstrumental: Tab fail.
bidding war?
BaconMane: But it was for Charity D:
AJIsAwesome: dammit! misping
0,5I wonder what idiot spent that much on a plush toy.
Bronysith did that change the course of human existance? I think not
dunno, but he must've been rich
probably some neckbeard in his mom's house surrounded by his other plushies
I think BaconMane is my number 1 favorite mod
BaconMane: Well, it WAS made with a great amount of detail.
0,5Crimson: I dont screw around :3
0,5AJ: Yeah, so?
Noooooooooooooooo totally nooooot
Do I really need to pay $100-$1000+ just to have something to snuggle up with when I go to sleep?
^
^^
you can easily pay 50 ish for a cheap whore maybe
0,5That's $2000 that could have been spent on like, food, or clothes, or payments. Or stashed for savings.
Lol!!
twilight_sprinkle hiya!
0,5Buytoast has the right idea
Anyone here up for some advanced MvM?
BaconMane: well maybe they have disposable income
/me hus CCCP :)
I don't want a cheap one, but I don't want to go into a $500 investment to buy it either.
0,5You know how many hookers I can hire wi- wait...
/me *hugs CCCP :D
/me hus twilight_sprinkle
BaconMane: ikr? i'm strapped for cash for musical equipment and people spend 3k on plushies :S
CCCP: Xd
twilight_sprinkle haha
hey, as far as I know, it's not illegal if ya don't pork em
I'm saving up to buy a gaming computer.
If i had the money id buy a damn accordion.... Such a fun looking instrument :D
pork em?
CCCP- read this.http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryFandom Furries are simply art nerds. Im somewhat of one (albiet a mild one) but there are indeed some really weird people in the fandom. But also a lot of awesome people. There is porn, but thats not a bad thing and there are plenty of furries who dont like that stuff.
0,5Idk, -$3000.... +1 small plushie
Canadian_Brony, inb4 Alienware Laptop
er, lemme rephrase that
end of game
Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
Rex_Mundi okay :P
I'm going to upgrade my old computer so A) it works and B) it works well.
I don't want laptop
I want a desktop
0,5That reminds me of the time I was playing Skyrim and I bought an enchanted mace for S9000+ and never used it.
:o
goddamn francis
though be aware that I didn't meant Bronies are furries
CrimsonPhoenix: Bronies are alot like Furries. Many Furries are bronies themselves.
Yeah
0,5Rex you're wrong
Soo...I heard there's gonna be a MLP commic somewhere in November.:$
point?
I'm excited. :3
BaconMane, please explain
BileGraze: have fun with that
0,5Im too lazy to explain in detail
0,5Furries like furry things
0,5bronies like MLP
BaconMane: A lot of fandoms are similar really
I think "Cloppers" are like furries. O.o
Let's not mention those people.
0,5I think cloppers is a really bad term. :/
BaconMane, that's different how?
depends on what they're spanking the plank to
BaconMane you can just let Silverscreen explain furries.
BaconMane: What term do you want me to use without being very blunt? lol
CrimsonPhoenix as Silverscreen when you see him.
:D
*ask
Rex_Mundi, now you're wrong
Rex_Mundi i skimmed threw it a bit and its a cool fandom i guess just honestly i dont really like anthromprphic things
Ponies are quite feral
0,5I don't mind NSFW at all, but I don't "clop" nor am I "clopper."
Oh O.o
BaconMane: i share that view
hey
it's better to just not join any fandom, because the assholes of it will always ruin you
I dislike looking at ponies in a pervert view
or humans with animal traits and fur
i cloped once man those cobblestones had it comin
is society so stupic that we name ourselves off of the porn people watch?
13still not sure if anyone is paying attention
0,5I don't identify myself as a brony anymore
Buytoast: remind me again, why are you even here? you hate everything, so why come to a place full of love?
So. Any advanced MvM?
I have no opinion on this topic.
11,02Are we seriously on the topic of porn .-.
Ihop: Oh god, hahaha :D
13I thought we said to stop with the porn discussion.
Anthropomorphism is simply humanlike characteristsics given to non-human characters. MLP ponies have personalities and can talk, thus, anthropomorphic
SuperBrony64, no porn
11,01Ooh. I have I Hate Mountains.
This palce aint full of love
GUYS!
Season 3: Sept. 17
11,02Enough of the porn talk everypony.
can we PLEASE MOVE ON
Buytoast no place is
please?
exactly
yeah.....i am lavin
They leaked season 3 villain online
SuperBrony64: I think i started it by mentioning that one term.... sorry :'(
leaving*
inb4 conversation about moving along goes on for a while
"full" being relative .-.
ShadowQuill: do NOT post it
ShadowQuill, we do not care
Okay, fuck this room. Fuck it. I'm not gonna look at fucking porn comments. Fuck this. I'ma go to a different room for a bit.
ShadowQuill: do not even hit at it
otakon: I will not
Buytoast: don't question my question, just answer it
0,5Just because people see brony as such a bad thing I'm not going to bother with assholes and not identify myself as a brony

11,02ShadowQuill: As a reminder, sharing Season 3 spoilers is against the rules :)
otakon: I CAN'T WAIT! IT WILL BE EPIC!

both in text and visual format
SuperBrony64: Wasn't gonna spoil it, just telling them what things have been found and the date of the season release
whats going on?
BaconMane: Wait, who sees bronies as a bad thing?
Buytoast: and so if you hate everything, how is a bunch of "bronies" talking entertaining to you?
Yay!
i dont think i should adentify brony as a persnoaitly trait but i must admit that honestly i am a brony
oh no
she comes

So am i
:(
ShadowQuill: she's streaming mate.
Why are people mean today?
ShadowQuill S3 does not yet have a release date. If it did, Tom might say somthing besides "Season 3 does not yet have a release date."
I didn't do it!
/me hugs RaveBrony
or somethin' like that
/me hugs CCCP
oh this is new~ i likes~
ShadowQuill: lack of ponies, 3 months of pony deficit is taking it's toll.
Ok I'm back
anyway bye everyone :(
Canadian_Brony: I just generally thought Sept 17 because all seasons begin then.
13has nothing to do with it otakon
seeya CCCP
Cya CCCP!
Shizuka: sorry, i wasn't here when the current discussion was told to stop so i just flowed with it, and i didn't mean to disrespect anyone if i did :(
Wait, end of Shizu stream? ;3;
ShadowQuill guesstimation. K
aaaan no noe gives a fuck! :D
Shizuka: I was trying to lighten the mood but that did not work it seems :(
13has to do with immature children thinking they can do whatever they want whenever they want when our rules clearly state otherwise
i never got why someone uses emotes when leaving, doesnt help with anything
I identify as a brony, but only if its relevent, im not going about the world telling anyone.

LadyCanary: Frollo is from Hunchback
Watching your stream, I realized that I suck compared to you Shizuka.

Frodo.
otakon: and voiced by the late Tony Jay
Pardon me.
Ponies47: the word furry enticed me to add my opinion, nothing more, for i am sensible.
Shizuka: I enjoyed the stream. The immense amount of butthurt between moast of the people in the chat annoyed me.
LadyCanary: NO YOU SHALL NEVER BE PARDONED

Wait...I'm a lady too. Can ladies slap ladies?
Bronysith: kind of like when Nyria didn't know what Bohemian Rhapsody was
...
lol
Speaking of Bohemian Rhapsody...
WindWhistler: Do you like the term pegasister?
otakon: SOMEONE DIDNT KNOW WHAT BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY WAS?!?!?!?!!?
BileGraze "Lord of the Rings" is a trilgy. It also has a prequel: "The Hobbit"
What the heck are you anyway?
We're playing that in orchestra
We're playing Bohemian Rhapsody
Canadian_Brony: that is gonna be another trilogy
Um, I havn't used it in a long time Ponies47. So I don't think I would ever really be online. Also my computer is super slow.
How we're gonna do it in an orchestra I have no idea
Theres going to be 3 'Hobbit' movies now.
WindWhistler: no, I was commenting on how Nyria didn't know what it was.
otakon: I know...but I was just saying "speaking of"
otakon Rex_Mundi What. The. Buck.

Hello all
BileGraze: Ah. Okie. Then you need a new computer :P

Canadian_Brony: you.do.not.slap.LC.

What did you mean by novels, oktakon?
Sonic? No!!!
Canadian_Brony: do it again and I'll press you into a crate.
ohai ponies
Hi IshPony.
13i do not think you can call the lord of the rings "novels" so much as "bricks"
BileGraze: Lord of the Rings was a trilogy of books from the 1950's IIRC
I wanna be your friend.
I LOVE Sonic. We need to stream AoStH
hiya IshPony
o

shizLOL
IshPony: Hello!
Shizuka: lol you could kill a man with one of the first editions, but I love them so.
Shizuka: LOL
otakon hiya nom victim
13tolkien did not understand the concept of "paragraphs"
JappleAck is a spy
otakon firstly, you should've cleaned this barrel. It smells like moonshine. Secondly, who is LS? I slapped WindWhistler
wait what IshPony?
ohai regs
otakon: i have the complete collection in one volume
Canadian_Brony: you slapped LadyCanary
otakon is a spy
/me nomz otakon to death
NO!
Canadian_Brony: prepare to die
/me knocks off the nomming IshPony
otakon: Canadian_Brony- There is a lot of backstory in the appendices in the LOTR books that take place during the time, like what Gandalf was doing when he was gone. The white council, Mirkwood and Dol Guildor with Sauron, Sarumon looking for the Ring... etc...
hai IshPony
0,5Who slapped me?
13i thought the maturity of mane chat was supposed to rise when schools started...
/me gets back on otakon
13not fall further..
BaconMane: Canadian_Brony
/me rips IshPony off otakon
BaconMane: not you, Canadian_Brony slapped LadyCanary
NO! I didn'!!
/me nomz Bronysith out of existence
otakon: Let's just say he did
Canadian_Brony: yes you did!
/me then returns to nomming otakon
Who would slap a Lady?
Alas.
They spy is a double agent
well this is entertaining
I'm a lady too.
Canadian_Brony didnt slap me >_>

I slapped WindWhistler! Scroll up!
I'm sorry Canadian_Brony
Seems we've received a surge of stupid from parts unknown. Very unfortuante.
I was already kicked for slapping. So don't get me.
/me stuffs WindWhistler into a smaller barrel reeking of apples.
Sometimes, I eat cupcakes.
Everyone is slapping everyone. we are the three Stooges!
BileGraze: delicious, chocolate I hope?
lol
BONG NOISES!
chat derp. My last message was from otakon
/me escapes
But of course.
GETTING STONED

I thought you were playing around.
Shizuka, the smart one's are busy at school
/me stuffs WindWhistler into a barrel, which he stuff into another barrel and tosses off of a cliff "ADVENTURE!!!!!!!!!"
/me sits in LadyCanary's lap.
BTW, you can sroll up and see I slapped WindWhistler. I would never slap LadyCanary. I'm not sane
And sometimes, I like to play baseball with my good friend, SlenderMan.
Canadian_Brony: insane
Maybe everypony is drunk
doesnt seem so bad right now
Go and dance with the ladies
Anyways, bye.
also hi
But I am a lady! D:
otakon I am insane

*Dances with WindWhistler*
WindWhistler: well still...wait catfight?
BileGraze: Bye!:)
what the heck was that voice over?!
bai BileGraze
otakon: You missed it.
thelonepony, it depends on if you believe in him or not
Shame on you otakon for missing it.
BTW, did BaconMane say anything when otakon said I slappd him even though I didn't?
p4ngya: it's disembodio, makes sure that the rifftrax stays in sync with the actions on the movie
kaboom!
Canadian_Brony: that wasn't otakon. That was me.
"i'm sexy and i know it" is on the radio here, almost enough to drive me away
ah
I was joking.
-_-
anyone else getting lag?
nnop
otakon: nah
WindWhistler: well i stole your face
odd
otakon, nope jus you
nope
Bronysith: You can't. I didn't show emotion.
my audio is fine but the video was seizing up
/me slap otakon with a fish
otakon: it is the tonberry in your internet, aniki
/me is fishslapped
13freebird!
otakon that was happening to me earlier.
Bronysith: will you get those damn Tonberry's out of my net!
the video was acting up earlier for me.
WHY DOES SCHOOL EXIST
otakon: they scare me, they are so cute though
/me Slaps IshPony with a rubber keyboard
I hate school.
-slaps ishpony with a salmon-
Bronysith: 1 hit kills, but ...cute.
Hey Shizuka, do you have a favorite pony?
RainbowDash90: your face when a salmon is a fish
WindWhistler: To increase one's knowledge.
13yes
/me takes the rubber keyboard, freezes it and smashes it over Eulshy's head
13vivi
WindWhistler: You think taht's bad? I had freshman only day today nad it was SO BUCKED UP! O_O
where?
WindWhistler if you didn't have school, you wouldn't be abe to do anything when you grow up basically.
where is Vi?
otakon: yup, just take away the knife, raise it yourself and such, they are quite cute
The state law of Wisconsin says we can't start school until labor day.
/me Misses Vivi and hopes she can come back soon
school sucks espeacally when your the only brony there.-_-
Bronysith: or give them a rubber knife
And then he shot himself
Canadian_Brony: I don't need school to play video games or draw.
lol
Shizuka: Respectable choice;)
woah he disappeared.
Ponies47: same here mate
otakon: damn it square, why did they make something so adorable deadly?
I made some dubstep vehsh dont hurt me please
otakon not sure. I've seen her once or twice in the chat when I came on for the first few times, but she didn't say anything.
otakon: The did some really weird (squee) :S

Bronysith: you'll be fine, your current corruption level should protect you.
it would feel like a rainbow went threw your skull and made your nose implode
DoctorWhoovesV10: wrong ring

Everytime they say Bilbo, it reminds me of Spock.:D
I mean, really bucking old
manly hugs were shared today
BINGO
Canadian_Brony: BINGO was 3 weeks ago, Bilbo.
Did Frodo have a job, anyway?
enope
otakon: so you dont want me to be gentle?
pfft, job
Bronysith umm . . .
he lived off of the fortune from the lonely mountain adventure
DAT BUFFER
… <_<… >_>… * kisses Luna * YOU ALL SAW NADA!
"Elven ropes. We sell them all over Middle-Earth to all those suicidal guys who want to be sure."
So is Equestria somewhere around Rivendell?
not sure
Rex_Mundi: One can only hope......
god this buffer
I don't have a map of all mythical lands
Everyday ahm bufferin'
safe as a sixpack in a AA meeting
I'm kind of sad Luigi's Mansion 2 got delayed
Meanwhile: so...does that mean it's not just me?
that doesn't sound safe
otakon nnope
/me One Buffering to Rule Them All
SpadeMagnes[R]: don't be, that means it'll be better when it does come out
SpadeMagnes[R]: Those were beta ghosts right?
I have to leave everypony, maybe see you later!
Spectrum_Rush buffeRING
LoLz
Rex_Mundi: Bye!
seeya Rex_Mundi
whats happening
byw Rex_Mundi
otakon: Every now and then there're pockets of buffer, but it sounds like you've got it worse.
otakon: yeah, but if it gets delayed and the game sucks, the delay will not be helping the game out.
http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw7692-1343905071857621.gif buffer disappoints the ponies
Hi mineroo. Fellowship of the Ring + Rifftrax
Take Duke Nukem forever for example
otakon: yes it does
Luigi's Mansion 2 was delayed? FFFFFFffff-
mineroo: Hello!
VenHur GODDAMIT
is this abriged?
Hello ^^
oh
hai mineroo
mineroo: Rifftrax
that's a game I'm looking forward to
SpadeMagnes[R]: perfect example. 12 years and it was everything that's wrong with modern gaming all wraped into one
mineroo: this is the theatrical version
Can't waitt until Pikmin 3 comes out.
*wait*
I agree
can't wait till doom 4 comes out
Sadly Pikmin 3 isnt a launch title
Fun fact: if you replace every instance of "elves", "elvish", and "elf" with Elvis it becomes funnier
Which is stupid
I want to play ZombiU
i have the game
the strength of mane failed
SpadeMagnes[R]: Couldn't agree more.
wait wait wait
No
:| Noo!
Pikmin 3 isn't a launch title?
And yet again, Elrond could've just shivved him and thrown him into the lava, ring and all.
I mean Pikmin 1 was a GC launch title
I remember NC doing a parody of this.
why didn't he JUST TAKE THE RING!
But nooooo.
Meanwhile: IKR?
otakon dumbass
Seriously, Elrond was a badass Elvis
he could have taken it and thrown it in himself
there, done deal
azul, wat r u doin? azul, STAHP
Mead for all
But we have to have plot!
wow lol to this
otakon: The power to resist the ring varies between each person.
SpadeMagnes[R]: well in the BOOKS that never happened
is it just me or does it keep jump cutting?
We cant have logic in things it would make it too easy!
030
AJIsAwesome: and yet Elrond didn't even TRY to take it, which means zero hold on him I think
whares pinkes forth wall
perhaps he couldn't bring it to himself to kill someone he fought alongside in a great war
mineroo: not on atm
man, I paid 200 rupees for that thing. broke just like that
:| You dun goofed, Boromir
Freefall29: lol
NO SHIT SHERLOCK
Staaaaaare.
otakon: True, but the ring corrupts everyone who touches it.
You need 100 smithing to repair that
Freefall29: :D
Canadian_Brony: let's see, fate of ALL the world for one more life OR the continuation of a great evil? ...I vote first.
SpadeMagnes[R]: bad reference is bad
:3 I know I do
I'm at least happy we get a new paper mario game this fall
finally
only took a dog's age
and he died
SpadeMagnes[R]: and its not gonna be like super paper mario, but its gonna be hard to be the 1000 year door
R.I.P. Old Yeller
SpadeMagnes[R]: True, but not to sound like a hardcore fanboy but I kind of miss the badges.
this part was in family guy
I like hard games
otakon think of the person closest to you. Would you ever bring the will power to kill them?
that background music
But 1000 year door wasnt that hard for me
sorry, I was trying to say beat.
spelling fail
I love Paper Mario: TTYD. The only game that I find better than the original.
AJIsAwesome: yeah, loved every minute of that game
the music is making me fall asleep
Paper mario 1 still has the biggest dick move ever
Thousand Year Door is awesme
SpadeMagnes[R] never played it. What was it?
if you fail one of the quizes in the final dungeon you can fight 3 anti guys at once
those 5 kisses
Canadian_Brony: one, Elrond and Isildur were comrades in arms; not lovers. Two, it it was over destroyin the greatest evil in the world FOREVER then I think I would.
The only part I founf hard about TTYD was the final boss. But that's because I got 3 Poison Mushrooms on the roulette and she killed me.:|
is there a spitfire here?
One anti guy is hard enough
That was NOT one of them
And then they...went they're seperates ways
*found*
Morrrdor
mineroo: I don't think so
mineroo: hello :3

mineroo: were you looking for me? o ,o
meanwhile F YOU THAT IS CUTE!
hey guys is there any way to chatprivatl with one parson
Freefall29: It only makes sense if you're the person I made it for. And since you aren't, you won't get it.

otakon: I love saying it like that :D
bill nye the music guy
they come on months
I appologize
Huh.
I so hated that table
SpadeMagnes[R]: bc they dropped the price bc the 3DS was kind of bombing at first
That is missing atleast 100 elements.
The .ic Table
Had to memorize it and take a test
Uup...
ir iron
So, some guy got up in Bill Nye's face about not believing in evolution. Nye told the guy to scientifically fuck himself.
Krypton :P
You silly humans and your periodic tables.
"Why are we taking a test over the table? It's right there. We can google it if we forget."
I mean... er...
.ic should be an acceptable abreviasion :)
just came back from watching Brave, quite a nice movie
HOH
How you're doing?
flutter_spin there is no gold gyarados, only red
I'm back!
Well I hope my mom will buy me a XL to replace my 3ds, my 3ds seems poorly made I havent damaged it at all and one side is loose and there seems to be a long line on the top screen

pony, bill?
RAWRity: nope. :)
everything... is matter
lol
harhar
yup
SCIENCE
HUE HUE HUE HUE HUE
Energy isn't matter?
RAWrity NOPE XD
and you can't destroy Energy
11,01And they exchange.
fire energy
SpadeMagnes[R], I can sympathize with you there. There's probably some morons out there that want a lvl 100 Celebi for whatever the heck they want.
Or spit. Keep it to your self Bill
Freefall29 I forces me to read every comment
im surprised how ytp-ish the editing is
that hot dog
:[ Matter! Got it memorized?
:D
he just pulled out a torch
otakon: what about a black hole
cook the dog
Bill Nye The Original YTP Guy.
quick, name the four states of matter
black holes are matter
BRB shower
hotdog in space
I can turn a hotdog into energy
now im hungery
....sure...
Freefall29: it's energy, it's a force that pulls on everthing
I got the buns!
13the fire however was matter
Hey Cypresswolf heard anything about anymore events?
Matter can be transformed into energy
and a pony?
nmonmonmonmonm
so much mustard!
Shizuka: eeyup. plasma
that's very nice...
RAWrity banana, dog, matterious and delicious?
Shizuka: but it was heat, therefore energy right?
I can't see anything!
13it was producing heat
dat analogy
otakon: the heat was. The fire wasn't.
13but flames are carbon turned into a plasma
...
damn my lack of understanding
Malk: no, right now its just BFF, Ren Fest meetup, & Oni Con
random Pinkie Pie

tasty....
11,01Or quarks.
fuck da crazy chick is back
in my ass
I still to this day think my 3ds was poorly made
otakon: you know how fire gives off heat, and thus you can feel heat witthout sticking your hand in fire?
Carbon freezes your smugglers
I have carbon?
RAWRity: yes
Barbetos: You shouldn't. It gets stuck in their hair.
Cypresswolf atleast ill get to go to the convention in galveston
cartman is in the air!
Barbetos: that's CarbonITE
I think I just released some carbon dioxide :p
SpadeMagnes[R], But yeah, I was about to have my Black and White teams fight each other in a lvl 100 battle, but I can't find the freaking option anywhere.
otakon: there ya go. the fire is matter giving off energy
one side is loose, the thing gets warm,
Im made of carbon
mfw ponies are silicon-based life
shit?
poop
Malk: were you here for Gigabit & Allegro's stream saturday night? They'll planning on coming to BFF

Whats worse is the trade with anyone option isnt any better

Now run along scant, to Mordor!

I like the artwork for this.
Midnight_Stormwing you should. We have some rather . . . interesting conversations
otakon: oh, sorry then :(
One cannot simply walk into mordor
/me walks into Mordor
Its like the movie Birds
This is a silly place.
The install screen is quite lovely on its own.
Meanwhile: One ring to rule. One ring to find them. One ring to track them down and in the darkness bind them. At least i think thats it
i dont know why they didnt just fly on the eagles to mordor
Flootahshy: cause... well... i kinda got bored of this chat... and i have poor multitasking skills at best
/me walks out of Mordor
Funfact: in a deleted scene from this, we see Boromir being instructed to steal the ring to save Gondor.
/me teleported into mordor
One does not simply rock into mordor
Because that would've been boring, Charlie_The_Bronco
13one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
Charlie_The_Bronco because that wouldn't make a good story.
*go east, toss Ring into Ocean*
One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
Charlie_The_Bronco: arrows
In the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.

Very good Shizu.
arrows....
$60?
13RAWRity: eeyup
s...sixty + dollars...
/me ponders like reptie
One does not simply bring down a mountain.
I used to have a one ring
LOL
It's 59.99 without taxes taken into account.
Fus ro dah?
Charlie_The_Bronco: ppl can shoot arrows at the eagles
That places it between 60 and 70 dollars.
One does not simply say "One does not simply"
one does not simply one does not simply
Use the clear skies shout!
one does not simply count to potatoe
but no montly fee so it's worth it i guess
SpadeMagnes[R]: he's a wizard, not a Dovahkhin
One does not simply make fun of lord of the rings
okay, who played the Song of Storms?
Damn
otakon: dat ping
Canadian_Brony: you caught me
otakon: You mean Dragonborn?
dat snow
No monthly fee and actually being worth playing is something not many MMOs manage.
AJIsAwesome: yes Dovahkhin
NO SHIT
Okay, who scared Fluttershy?
otakon: also its Dovahkiin.
im a canadian brony as well....what does that make at this poin t? like 5 of us?
ONE MOVIE TO RULE THEM ALL, ONE MOVIE TO FIND THEM, ONE MOVIE TO BRING THEM ALL AND ONE MOVIE IN THE DARKNESS TO BIND THEM
Charlie_The_Bronco: maybe 7
Usually no correlation there, but it's a general occurence.

unfortunately
RAWRity: theres a to scale replica of middle earth in minecraft

Charlie_The_Bronco: over the top yes
The idea of a monthly fee was not compelling.
that's how SimGretina convince me
cachi01|phone: never heard of him

thats CRAZY!
I'm content to leave my rogue with his legendary daggers and his heroic DS gear transmogged into Naxx 25 stuff where he is.

*hugs Pearly and pats her on the head*
Shizuka still really good
13this bit of dialogue actually happens like five pages into the book
compred to crap I've seen
*compared
13(that's about as far as i got... LOTR is bloody DENSE)
I played for 5 years.
Shizuka: Yeah, back in Bagend
Canadian_Brony: *Looks at Birdemic*
Sounds like a marriage pep talk :P
Shizuka: I read them when I was 11
That's a lot.
I read the first two books, never finished the third, don't even remember a word of any of it
Shizuka: Bro, there wasn't even dialogue for like 30 pages. LOTR IS BLOOD DENSE
:D yay Rex_Mundi
Gandalf really has the creepy old man whistle going on
13they must not have invented paragraphs in tolkien's time
listen close
I have never read a single LoTR book.
I learned in The Burning Crusade, I refined through Wrath of the Lich King, and I ruled Cataclysm.
HoodyNinja i t
Shizuka: never try reading the Silmarillion. It makes LOTR look like See Spot Run
Could you use it as a paper weight?
When in doubt, Go Left
Shizuka: what are these paragraphs you speak of
13i think i checked out silmarillion once
cachi01|phone: a n
I own that
HoodyNinja i thought there were 6 books
Shizuka: ONCE
Shizuka: You should read the "council of Elrond" chapter...
13i promptly turned around and returned it
That sounds way more badass than it should.
0,5Behold, Doralius
cachi01|phone: 3 in the Lotr series
0,5THE MIGHTY ZEPHYRBLADE
ive only read the hobbit, great book
Ikr.
Shizuka: WHat's it about?
HoodyNinja fellowship of the ring part 1 and 2
Shizuka: that's because its fucking boring, but a good readd
13even atlas shrugged understood what paragraphs were
inb4 Disemaudio ruins an epic scene
and i turned left toward the mid east
The two towers part 1.and 2
So many pillars
Shizuka: its lore heavy
Shizuka wow
Seriously. Tolkein was a fucking genius at world building, but his writing style was fucking dry as the sahara.
And return of the king 1 and 2
13also yes, disembaudio syncs the "you shall not pass" line which totally blows the awesomeness of the scene
cachi01|phone: Thats the extended edition movies
Me: Aw yeah, LotR! Me a second later: Aw, more Rifftrax!
gee, great
MMMMUUUUUUFFFFFIIIIIINNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSS
Its a trap!
hello everypony! What're we watching? :)
diet sprite?
this will be . . . interesting?
Ugh
(it was a good Aw!)
Shizuka REALLY?
I actually like dry writing, so meh
13yeah
Chocolate: Hello! LoTR.
Chocolate: Rifftrax
Chocolate: rifftrx lotr
13sorry :/
NOOOOOOOOOO
Troll Rifftrax.
00,03Chocolate: The Hunchback of Notre Dam
HoodyNinja i know but in my school library there is a book which contains all books
Shizuka then i'll write it here to make it up for them
13thing is it's a good line to sync because everyone knows it's coming
Inb4 Cry
Is it just me, or is the music way, way louder than the dialogue?
Damn thats a thick book
cachi01|phone: Your school library is stoopid
HoodyNinja yes it is lol
I feel his pain unlike the animated version
SpadeMagnes[R]: My auto shop book is larger
inb4 Frodo dun goofed.
13tSparx: this sync has the riff in the left channel only, and quite a bit louder than the movie audio
HERE IT COMES
and the safety section is six pages long
And the book is never mentioned again
Ah kk
Well fuck
13stream is in mono mode to balance the panning, and i have volume leveling on to bring the movie up
oh boy
here it comes
I wonder if they ever watched "Silent Movie". That would be kinda impossible to sync.
INCOOOMIIIING
YA DUN BEEN SHRUNK!
How can you tell if a shadow moves in the dark, exactly?
goddammit
13so what pippin just did
So while I'm installing this game, care to give any pointers?
ikr Canadian_Brony
BUUFFEEE

R
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU-
Meanwhile: Its darker than the other darkness
FOOL OF A TOOK
Shizuka: any way too shutup disemaudio for that one scene?
13nope
dat clanging
Darnit Pippin! You've doomed us all!
13mm
13wait
The funniest thing is that this scene is even more comical in the book xD
Dwarves have some talented stone masons.
dat grounding
13hm
13i *might*
dat insult
Pippin dun goofed
Barbetos: thats all they DO
13if you'll let me rewind a little?
sure
I don't mind
Shizuka: Sure.
GO FOR IT GIRL!
DJ P0N-3'S A COMIN!
13nope
Shizuka: eh, don't bother. It's a scene we've all seen plenty of times before.
RUN!!!!!
Hey Shizuka- Do you have an OC pony?
13yep won't do it
RAWRity: You, sir, are not a true nerd
You've awokened the cheerleaders - they've waited centuries to show off their pep
"You cannot pass. You cannot pass. ... You cannot pass!" -- what Gandalf says in the book
13mike does a scary good robin williams
Movement is important, the minimap has a zoom function, f is the interact key, story is personalised, and names can have spaces.
Cypresswolf: :D
Damn, i gotta go at 10:00, in 13 minutes
,
I would make a arrow joke but I wont
"They have a 4chan Troll!"
mork indeed
HoodyNinja: a true nerd means being mindlessly entertained by something I've seen plenty of times before for no other eason than that it's familir?
13Rex_Mundi: http://fav.me/d5bxohx
Give thought to your class choice.
13hm wait let me try something again
I've seen this scene a dozen times, heard the rifftrax 0 times.
SpadeMagnes[R] u were about to say an arrow to the knee.joke
13after the battle
"WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT JESUS!"
Shizuka did kirz draw that?
Shizuka: How very lovely.
13ja kirz did :)
BUT THE U TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE
RAWRity: Okay, your not a BIG lotr fans, you just dont mess with that scene
Im sorry i've had this franchise in my childhood since i was 3
Shizuka remind me to give him praise next time I see him, k?
13RAWRity: yeah we all know what he says and how he says it, just a shame that dis syncs it
lol
Dat mike tyson
Woah
HoodyNinja: I'm a lotr fan, but going to unnecessary trouble for a few lines of dialogue we all know already seems pointless
ok that was pretty funny
13seems it converts to mono if i tell it to cut a channel
That mike tyson impression
lmao
Suggestions?
oh no!
13so can't remove riff
13sorry :/
lol
Aim for the kne- I mean throat!
Use the force Harry... ~Gandalf
Shizuka: is sad day
Throat is the new knee
Shizuka s'alright *sniff*

Whatever feels best.

1 human mage, 1 Dwarf warior, 1 night elf hunter, 2 human wariors, 4 gnome. Low level loot fetch quest.
these elves talk funny
13i wouldn't put boromir in mage
You, Sean Bean, will die in this movie, as well
And then Boromir was sent to the moon
As it is your fate
13wait
Shizuka: Gandalf
Boromir's the Cannon fodder
Rex_Mundi: Aragorn's a ranger
13oh you meant gandalf
13deeeerp
He dual-classes warrior in Return of the King
"Let's get HAMMERED! This is a Jägermeister-Fountain!"
can ponies do jagerbombs?
13gandalf pretty much multiclasses everything by the end
i think they can
well gandalf could be 4th ed mage ;)
gandalf should have been in a nursing home by the end
Shizuka: boromir as barbarian?
Shizuka: and Sam doubles as a pack mule
Introducing Morgan Freeman: "Lemme tell you something. Hope is a dangerious thing!"
13ubiquitous bad guy
Charlie_The_Bronco: Gandalf is an ancient spirit who's existed since almost the beginning of the world.
boromir would be a fighter
either tank or dps
nursing home. rest my case
13Rex_Mundi: gandalf's busy looking at his items, uncrating a few boxes, he'll pick his class and get back next movie
What.
considering how many arrows Boromir can take, I'd say he makes a good Tank
Just read that post and...what.
broke back mount doom
Shizuka then they the devs found that gandalf cheated to get them stats, and banned bim by way of boat from Middle Earth.
Malk: LAWL
so are rocks, doesnt make them good sorcers
13gandalf gets VAC banned
Shizuka: Maybe hell try that "Melee hunter" thingy.
Shit, seeing Sean Bean reminds me that I have to wait almost a year still till the next season of Games Of Thrones! DAMMIT!"
lies you die b man
13frodo too for completely breaking the most powerful game artifact
"Here, take a sip from the Jägermeister-Fountain!"
Gandalf had like 1000 dollars worth the games too.
Gandalf is a mage, dual-classes warrior. Boromir's a tank warrior. Aragorn's a ranger, dual-classes dps warrior.
Shizuka: not to mention completely fucking up the final instance.
nnoooo....noooooo....a miser gandalf no home...nooooo
13totally crashed the mordor server
Gimli's a tank warrior, Legolas a ranger
Aragorn would be a rouge
Drink the sunny-d
nooo..noooo a miser gandalf he no home
Barbetos, it would also depend on the rules you are using :)
Rex_Mundi: rogue*
It is good sunny-d
Rex_Mundi: No, like, Aragorn *is* a ranger.
aragorn is ranger/fighter
boromir fail tank 2 stabs dies
13aragorn's ranks in tracking and such definitely put him into ranger
Rex_Mundi: When they first meet him, he's known as the most famous ranger in the lands surrounding the shire.
ihop he rolled critical fails
I know
13he puts a level or two in fighter before the end though
And then after the banning of Frodo and Gandalf, the guild Fellowship of the Rings was just not the same. With everyone assuming it was full of hackers, the prestige was never restored.
13a vision of lord of the rings as directed by michael bay
The one scene that's, imo, better than the book, right here.
"This is Wacken 2013!"
13frodo is that a ring in your chest or are you happy to see her?
most elves are either rangers or Fighters (Bow spec.)
or mages
Stirder the Ranger.
13they couldn't afford to animate her mouth this scene
Aragorn puts his skill points into Melee and unarmed, witch is redundent he should have put some points into guns. With his agility set to 9... wait... wrong game.

and he's STILL FIGHTING
I starved them and made them sleep in their piss

A lot of fanfics disturb me. Very few I read and even fewer I like

What was it about Rex_Mundi?
My mom is, I guarantee you, the biggest LotR fan out of all of us here. It's awesome.

You really can take a lot of arrows before you die, and a lot more arrows before you die immediately.
Canadian_Brony: Does it involve any shipping?
Malk: (\ :3
13it'll hurt like almighty hell
Canadian_Brony: I think I've browsed a total of 10 fanfics.
13but yeah
AJIsAwesome oh god no.
I've got more people waiting to die :)
The real problem with arrows is that they will cripple you.
13aragorn's thinking heads heads heads heads
Canadian_Brony: Good. I might check it out.
Arrows are actually one of the worst implements of murder in the history of war.
i have read over 100 fanfics
:0
not the younglings
Meanwhile: they're not meant to murder though. Only to incapacitate from a distance.
glorious audio desync
Reikim: also, if they were planted in the ground they are more likely to cause infection.
make sure they suffer
Canadian_brony can you read every fanfic and show me the good ones?
Arrows are one of the most ineffective instruments of murder...but one of the greatest at maiming/crippling/hindering
Yup~
Ded....
I recall "Twilight needs a new quill" , "Pinkie watches paint dry" , and "Days of Wasp & Spider"
flutter_spin read the story and make it 11. Comedy, Slice of Life. Not too large, but still really good.
They're also really cheap, and easy to mass produce.
hey what is this wallet made of its really nice.....oh yeah....my younliiiinggss :'(
i have an idea
For Winterfell
death by bass ;)
And even those I vaguely read through
SLOW DEAD IS SLOW
Hmm?
Oh? Are we talking fanfiction again? White Box.
13luna in a special cameo as legolas
flutter_spin: Arw those normal fanfics?
White. Box. Best fanfic I have ever read.
define normal.
I've read "...and the Kitchen Sink" where Rainbow Dash falls in love with an actual Kitchen sink
tSparx and the crossbow is deadly when you have tons of farmers fighting for you
twilight gets a free salad
oh captain my captain
The guy who did "Days of Wasp & Spider" redid it like 50 times. It surprised me of the detail put into it.
AJIsAwesome the first and second are comedies, not sure about the third.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYGioWinQQE
something like that
RAWRity: See, this is why I don't read fanfic, right there
Technically, there is no "Best" when it comes to fanfics. Just really good.
"Twilight needs a new quill" is kind of the first one I actually wanted to read. Kind of weird.
RAWRity: It could even be good, Idc.
RAWRity: Have you read White Box yet?
"Pinkie watches paint dry" really freaked me out. A new take on such a simple matter. I kind of stopped reading after it.

Who here read, and really liked, "Rainbow Factory"?

I hope Mike continues the let's play he started c:

StinkomanFan: Don't worry.
flutter_spin: Who cares about that? I don't need it. As long as I can get on EQD I'm proud.
Call apon the Sea ponies!
sam should have called upon the sea ponies
This part, I actually had to ask my brother "What, he can't swim?" and he explained to me about hobbits and water :P

Oh, I didn't know Hobbits couldn't swim.
flutter_spin: So true, it has a meaning that more attention makes you less the man you wanted to be, it's a path that must starts off small, or in a big way.
AJIsAwesome: They're like Gorons
How does one call apon the sea ponies when your drowning?
Watching it for the third time xD
AJIsAwesome: Mostly
Shizuka: not the extended cut. That's over 4 hours.

Either way, the final word is WRYYYYYYYYYYY
Hey daspinkie
hi daspinkie
I guess noponys streaming
00,03Ponies47: Only fun when the people you're talking to aren't a bunch of floozies... :|
hey Scoot-Scootaloo or Shizuka are we still doing the lotto?
/me hugs Scoot-Scootaloo
Ponies47 you in a skype call?
Scoot-Scootaloo you mean like 7 of your cousins?
wait. . . what the buck are floozies?
00,03Nah, they're cool, just... other floozies
Scoot-Scootaloo: There not. We're just talking about random stuff :P
13we're waiting on something before we can actually send survey
00,03^
ahh kk
13unfortunately we can't make it go faster >>
making sure I was still... on the list and all :p
Malk: Yeah. THat's the reason why I haven't pretty much said anything for about the last hour. I'm still in the call :P
13and then new comments on my youtube
ohai everypony :)
Shizuka: Your welcome! ^^
you have a youtube acct? :)
Ponies47 I thought you where in the shower
13ja.. linked the videos after i stopped stream
0,14also, I remained president of my fighting game club!
heck, osx is unix based, might as well be linux, and windows has colinux (port of the linux kernel to windows)
Malk: I was. I came back said Iw as back and then went back to my Skype call
0,14as did my vice president I have a crush on!

Okay

13you mean tron 2.0?
hai kirzstryfe
good evening everypony :)
Scoot-Scootaloo oh, nevermind. Talking to your cousins on Skype isn't as fun as IRL, cuz then you can gang-up on one, wrap him in a blanket, stuff him in a box, wrap that in a blanket, turn it upside-down, and watch him try to get out. Somehow it's always me.
hey
Hey kirzstryfe!
Allo kirz.
Eddmario if u see Andrew wk in something It means epicness
hi kirzstryfe
00,03...yes... exactly Canadian_Brony
Hi Krizstryfe
just got home from work >.<
I've caught up to you, you keep sneaking in levels while I'm not looking.
Hi kirz :)
/me glumps the crap out of kirzstryfe
lol
Brohoof everypony /)
ello kirzstryfe
Scoot-Scootaloo we're a very close family filled with teenagers.
(\
How was work anyway?
hey kirzstryfe
not sure which server I want to end up on, or if anyone's decided on one everyone can agree on
(\
kirzstryfe I saw your finished drawing of "Shizuka's Bakery". Dayum, that is good!
I think US is a good idea.
:)
hey shizuka bill nye is way better then spongebob
Also kirz I got GW2!
long, 8 3/4 hours training, 5 days/week for the next 11 weeks
^^
You're the only other person whose playing I'm aware of.
:)
It is updating!
Moopy NO
NO
eeyup
13http://fav.me/d5bxohx kirzplug
I'm on Stormbluff Isle I think, let me check
Rei is still loading and T doesn't mention it.
eenope
that one!
eeyup
Right now I'm looking at something like 5 GB of patches! It is ridiculous!
And it only released under a week ago!
Argharghargh
does GW2 have a demo?
Pfft. 5GB of patches.
Shizuka do you make blue berry muffins?
yeah, I'm just glad I had most of it downloaded already from the betas
no demo yet
13nope
no stream . . . epic MV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVCFV7jT9ho
I actually got it on disc, k?
And yet
Can you imagine if you tried to load WoW, from scratch, right now?
HOURS OF UPDATING
silly Shizuka <3
haven't buy it yet but will do in a close future
Moopy: I like Spongebob :<
*PMV
13also
Spongebob is kewl :3
oh
13those of you with l4d1
Loading WoW from scratch, right now, would involve me sticking a knife into my hypothalamus.
Meanwhile, i installed wow from scratch about 4 or 5 years ago
13http://www.ihatemountains.com/download-left-4-dead-1/ DO IT NOW
I've reloaded WoW once, took the better part of a day
buy it or bought not sure ...
Kuddle buns
Meanwhile, it was 12GB then
4 or 5 years ago. Pfft. You'd be running TBC.
Dat map.
I still remember playing it x_x
2 expansions later.
i cant remember dates
Shizuka: I would, but I have the console verison of the game, and it's back home with my brother in Illinois
think it was 4 or 5
13it's like above valve quality
I shoudl add more games to my Steam when I get my new computer. Which should be Friday! :D
Wow its from the creators of portal prelude
hey you ponies want to hear something great well watch this click the link here
*should
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7zEmtB2giU&feature=player_detailpage
Must be good
Good golly, I can't imagine that the game will be able to top itself after this!
Dem farts
I mean, who could possibly hope to outdo this loading sequence?
Shizuka: Wasn't Cold Stream, the newest L4D2 DLC, originally a mod for the PC version?
And dat kik
Even IF the artwork is gorgeous!
Look at him, all bright eyed and shiny.
sorry guys cheese
hehe
haven't seen the boxed version load screens
What was the link? I'm not clicking it with how my computer is -_-
Oh it's gorgeoous.
Ponies47 SFM farting
I can't imagine his first five minutes...
So, I see the next A movie is based on a newspaper comic strip
I'm guessing it's the same style as the intro videos though
"Look at all the buttons!"
I want to find the artist who created this, shiv him, and then absorb his soul.
well i told you guys its funny untill i got kicked
SfM ponies on a fart compertition
Oh there were no buttons.
cachi01|phone: =_(\ Wow
There was, however, a COLOURED BAR.
And it was all white but then it became less white and more red.
yeah, Stormbluff Isle, was one of the only US servers that wasn't capped on the first day
And then it was full!
And then I LOGGED IN!
Not much can feel more awkward than your mother walking in while singing along to a song.
runs medium pop I think, which is good
It was exciting.
And my chat is derping
im sorry i will never do that link ever again
so Meanwhile, swap to my server :3
You're on US, my connection'd be fudge.
Fun fact: wow backwards is platypusdinosaurwordijustinventedandnomayonnaiseaintaninstrument
Alright Every pony. This is all I have to say right now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMaBta4SxI
flutter_spin with what?
i've seen gw2 screenshots
yeah >.<
(for tonight)
they know how to art
So what, should we fiind a halfways server?
13a poorly captured video of a television?
13i see
Like one in New Zealand?
I got clocked in the face by spiders earlier because of a bit of lag delay, I can't imagine what that'd be like.
Yes, good God the GW2 staff know how to art.
Professionaaaal.
Btw guys what do you think of the square enix in-browser game feature?
:( I couldn't find a good clip
flutter_spin done with what?
that they do
I'm done watching stream :P
. . .
Half the development cycle must have been dumped into solely art.
they've had 6 years to work on it though, so it'd had better have been good
as in, it just stopped?
Ponies47 y new name?
>__>
They probably chained brilliant minds to desks and commanded them to churn out beauty by the bucket.
Fine. I instantly thought of it when the stream ended, but couldn't find a clip of it
Only the extremes of hunger and fatigue could create this.
oh
okay
mmm watchaaa saaay
So when I finally DID find a reference to it... the gag was already gone
gotta remember that
Starvation is the key to TRUE ART
darn
cachi01|phone: dat imogen
bipedal fish things
Eeyup lol
can regen health like crazy if you don't finish them off
imogen heap: hide and seek
have a Hoedown http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB1CLbEewU&NR=1&feature=endscreen
hide and seek is best kiñling song
Killing*
come on dude im trying to make everypony happy about the link i sent i mean come on the kicking........really
"Your mother is a drunk"
topic of the hoedown
Pfft.
they probably just took their time
thought about it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIIwwCi2zwk check this one out (its long, but funny)
and built it as they go
I went through them like a weedwhacker.
Mmmmmmmm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLyzscHXtWM&feature=youtube_gdata_player
unlike something like swtor which was $200,000,000 spent on overpaid contractors
flutter_spin not available for phones
yeah, but if you let one live thinking it'll die from dots or something, they can surprise you
EA doesnt know how to art
So as it is, I think I /can/ move to the server in question, but I dunno if it'd take a while or if it'd be screwy when I did.
cachi01|phone: that's old
I remember that from years ago
i want to try gw2 :(
Dear sister is an old meme...
Its a meme right
flutter_spin you have one bucked up textbook
Right?
Canadian_Brony: lol
Why do I keep losing coneection to the server!?! :[
*connection
Shell out 67 USD and you, too, can experience the joy of patching.
The server doesn't like you. o.o
flutter_spin I can't stop laughing! This is great!
Weeeird phone is weird
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO7tseyAMF0 another one
lol
I have a pet shark :3
Writes Ponies47 and i get Penis47 in the suggestions
that was not funny at all dude
I can stomp so hard things near me go flying.
bye everyone
If you really want to have fun, though, try League of Legends.
/me Slaps cachi01|phone "Shuda up"
Later Big_Macintosh_1992
bye bye everypony have to go to work
The ULTIMATE patching experience, and it's ABSOLUTELY FREE.
Huehuehue.
Ponies let me send u pic
Its not a joke
flutter_spin do you have to do the problems IRL, or are you doing it for LoLz?
seeya Big_Macintosh_1992
Later Maid_RainBow ;)
Needs more sweedish redneck techno: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gFyKFEsCeo
cachi01|phone: Don't you dare -_-
Reikim, plus you get to run around saying you play 'LoL'
Canadian_Brony: lol. They aren't mine, if you are implying that.
The best part of it?
ah
ok
gw2 even comes with a platforming minigame :3
nvmd
They release a new patch practically every other week, if not more!
So you can have fun OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
makes you wonder, tho
The last time I platformed on here, I got hit in the foot by a trebuchet and flew forty feet to my death.
Ouch.
yeah definitely
Okay, think I'm done being bitterly sarcastic, anyone up for an MvM game.
?
No Artie did it. The same guy who did EXTREME <insert here> : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrSwaA-FAj4
so much tinfoil
Accept the file ponies47!
(may want to turn it down a little)
/me looks at Moopy
Well folks, gtg for the night...
seeya VenHur
Night VenHur :)
umm.....ok
so much yelling
Team BStateRegs is best bot-bashing team.
ugh. rap.
I have to stay ahead of Meanwhile on the levelling curve >.>
^
Can't you...can't you both take a break? Mebbe?
So I don't fall even more behind?
Night Ve.....awwww :<
I'm still twelve hours away from actually playing.
Told u it wasnt a joke
But I just moved server, I have to see if I can flatten kirzs head with my shield.
Naw. Artie just has a lot of "we are a bunch of guys coming up with crazy stuff to do on our spare time" type of guys
/me sighs
Fiiiiiiine
I'd much rather see it myself but fiiiiiine
you know, stuff patches faster if you're not downloading other stuff :P
'M not!
13uh huh
13we all know your pony addiction
No
No that is not a thing
Don't judge me!
Moopy fine then, dont say hi :(
Ded chat is ded
what im just playing left 4 dead 2 with my friend on the xbox
/me quickly hides his ponies
he dead
Dead
that friend is me :D
lol
Artie does a ton of impersonations. My personal favorite is from Uncle Buck: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k4O_id93o0 Yes, that's his voice.
That weird moment when you realize ezio VA is the same as sonic
Ezio?
that's not what ponies are for...
Auditore
really? who plays them?
Ponies47: What the buck? I'm on my computer and I see no p***s47 here :|
oh oh Assassins Creed
I'm bad with personal names
That's just sick -_-
What are they for, then?
Roger Crai
G
I cannot think of any concievable use for ponies other than watching them out of amusement.
Ponies47 ikr
Ponies47: is there an impersonater?
I really dont see me buying a laptop since all I'm gonna do with it is play WoW and other shit and watch streams and youtube
I'm just going through this out there. Not sure if anyone will have fun with it. http://www.incredibox.com
I suppose, were they larger, one might ride them as a form of transport.
Incredibox?
its a sound mixer type of application
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02dX6VexfcA&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=55&feature=plpp_video
Thx.for the eargasm spade
...
superretroworld: I think cachi's phone is messing with him
I didn't think it was too loud
Why can't I play Half-Life 2?
eargasm is a good thing
weird
Is when your ears have an orgasm!
13http://youtu.be/Nq1nC4RVF28
flutter_spin: This is strangely addicting :)
yes it is Petrified_Discord
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25m3wuYo994 Oh hey new rubberfruit video
It is also v2. Much better than v1, but the other has different sound effects
volibear so awesome
anyway is there enough people for MvM ?
LOL Shizuka
What, he's the giant armoured polar bear isn't he?
Well, there's me.
Yo kirz, you paying attention?
Reikim yes he is
Meanwhile seems to be occupied, so that eliminates the only other potential player I can think of.
I'm trying to figure out if I'm actually on the server or not.
Shizu want to play MvM ?
My UI says yes, kirz says no.
13hm
13not sure
dat random vid...
cachi01|phone: like music?
I guess I can wrap up this story quest and come play.
Ugh. My computer is glitching up agian. When it masks me afor somthing a white box appears problem is the box is just blank and I can't do anything about it :|
Okay, so pin Shizu as a "maybe".
Yep i like music
Same with Meanwhile.
kirzstryfe leave guild wars and come to play MvM
/me throws a tumble weed
sorry. Still having fun with Incredibox
You could probably go into manechat and make Phase fail another will save, if he's there.
Ponies47 kick it and if that doesnt work use duct tape
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3XeLmQBDeM&feature=BFa&list=PL297445C6A3381D39
I dunno, for whatever reason I can't see.
cachi01|phone: no i mean is eargasm liek listening to good music?
cachi01|phone: Duct tapes solves all problems! :D
http://www.jeffpalm.com/fox/fox.jpg

I can get another friend to scoot over, makes five.
no sound
http://www.collegehumor.com/article/5975407/5-browsers-and-the-modes-of-transportation-they-resemble
don't worry
Oh, and Shizu possibly, that would make six.
its only a gif
kirzstryfe then don't get mad if someone steal your spot :p
man this place is quiet as a crypt
what is a gif exactly?
Nobody's going to steal it.
sorry rainbowdash90 my time limit from my step dads computer dude sorry
Dat sexy pinkie
You wouldn't download a police officer!
Pinkie dancing like gandam
flutter_spin :D IE is a dead horse
What ever that is
Reikim inb4 someone joins
Bah
Canadian_Brony: Yet my school insists on using it ._.
Even if they do it'll leave a spot open.
IE is Chrome's bitch
Now let's see if I can actually, yknow, get Steam to start TF2.
IE is the best browser for downloading another browser.
the only use for IE is to download a new browser
^^
^
Never use IE and is good in the same sentence
what should our guild name be? (hint: not Bronystate)
My mom invited some people over and I asked them about their browser. They said Firefox. I suggested Google Chrome and he said, "I don't use anything by google. They monitor what you type"
It should be
Um
unless its IE is good for getting a new browser
Shoot I'm bad at this.
To say IE is good is a prequalification for mental insanity
I am dead serious. So they don't use google mail, google search, google maps, google....
So that guy is paranoid?
flutter_spin: Well, yeah. Google collects everything they damn well can about you, and that's what makes them so good.
flutter_spin XDDDDDDDDD
Does this guy wear tinfoil?
the League of justice!
wait i heard that before
Anything I come up with will either be satirical or an anime reference, just because I suck ass at naming.
His excuse was something about searching for a school and suddenly his inbox was full of ads. He came to that conclusion.
the pony's face is all...wat
Dat filly pony ponies
tempted to go with one of the old guild names I've had, either Bastion or Cupcake Kitten Brigade
PONYCEPTION?
He doesn't use Bing either.
nvm i'm going blind ;_;
13guild name?
yeah
13guild of ponies
Make it
Celes_Chere: That's my OC as a wittle colt. :3
Cupcake Kitten Brigade sounds cool
The Technicolour Pony Brigade.
That, or the Steel Rangers because reference.
13flaming fist
13because baldurs gate
Ponies47: I thougt you had used the : | face but you didn't. Hence the blindness...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=jh2qIkqx-0A
Ponies47 ur oc looks like bronydanceparty OC
Oh, we're going to be like that then.
anyone wana play tf2?
um
Shoot
0,14The Buster WOlves
I'm all out of reference NO SAXY
Never end a guild name with the letter s.
Celes_Chere: The colt faces that pony maker has SUCK. That's really a Celestia face. Fine by me :P
Cool league of ponies kirzstryfe
Busted Wolves
I CANT PLAY TF2 :[
Nah, I gotta get some UNIX learning done.
cachi01|phone: But I liek my OC :<
*like
0,14the Kewl Kids Club?
inb4 no one gets it
*Klub
Ponies47: Apparently she's working on a better version for the iPhone
-.-
Celes_Chere: O.O
The overall cool guys guild?
Okay, looking up references. Again.
League of Extraordinary Gentlefolk.
Celes_Chere: YA- Oh wait I don't have a Iphone. :/
yep no one got it or most are just ignoring it
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid my fanfic plug
I'd suggest the Gurren Brigade but fuck no.
Oh
:p
Order of the Unrustled Jimmies
Name us NERV. Or SEELE. Because Evangelion.
I find that the best guild names are fairly short.
http://generalzoi.tumblr.com/post/28132018204/pony-creator-update
Fight Club?
13Equine Victory Alliance
I haven't even started my fan-fic
ScootaChicken would aproove
going with an iconic name sets bad standards for the guild, I've found
Aha Shizu, I see what you did there.
Indeed.
/me is uber procrastinating on his fanfic.
heh. I've been working on my fanfic ever since Season 2 ended
my third one, that is
13Equine Victory Alliance
I think I'm up to about 70,000 words total
I shoot for 1,000 words a day (roughly)
/me is procrastinating on 4 fanfics...at once
Gondor Guild
/me Has never wrote a fanfic
All in favour of the Equine Victory Alliance, hit Meanwhile with a brick.
You're better off with something that sounds good, doesn't have any particular links to irl things and isn't too lengthy.
but then nobody would ever be able to find us
/me has never uploaded a fanfic.
Celes_Chere: tsk tsk tsk
/me was planning on doing a fanfic
/me is not pressuring Ponies47 : >_>
Yeah, that's what I thought.
/me is too lazy
Will anihilated leagues leaders eternaly
id love to write a fanfic, just need to think of a story
/me wonders about all of the actions
Wall-e for short
of course, I have to find the damn guild registrar again first
I'm still planning my fic
I don't know how to start it off
Damn we suck at naming things.
i,can give you my story if you want superretworld
Canadian_Brony: Start at the middle, maybe?
My writing keeps improving. Yes, I've included the mods here in my story, especially S-U-M-.. well you know
I have no idea what to make a fanfic about. Plus story making ain't worth a (squee) :/
I hit a wall in my fan fic.... (damn filler chapter)
Reikim told you someone will join
Well, what do we want the guild to say?
That would be because I have Malk as a friend.
>iPhone
>Flash
Sorry, what?
Hm
What do we want the guild to say?
Iphone has flash?
Equine Victory Alliance [PONY]
Hah, no.
?
Reikim i have it to i think that's why i told you
:3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH72I1NmxWg
Ponies47: I think it comes down to what you want to do as a "hobby" Some do artwork, others do plushies. Custom blind bags...
They shun the idea.
Are we going for something relevant to the game, or something for the site, or the show, or what?
kirz has implied that it's not related to the site.
If we put up a pony name, we'll be flooded with membership requests.
would like to have [PONY] as the tag, but free from the site so not to discourage people from joining
heh Barbetos
13kirz only still has hop here because inertia is a property of matter
BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY sorry
Me? I like to write. I did fanfics for WoW, LotR, Star Wars...
umm........guys whos Tom?
Celes_Chere that ain't my style. I'm trying to get main ideas down in my head before I start typing, then I fill it in as I go along.
Tom is our little bot that tells how much longer for the next episode
So are we making the guild public? I assumed we'd just be using it as a sort of chat related affair.
you can also do the little code....
!cd who are you?
Next episode air time is unknown.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
flutter_spin: Well I'm not much of a artist. I just do it when I'm bored I mean look my DA only ahs 4 postings :/
That was my assumption as well.
Thats tom
I've seen him actually talk once.
same
*has
i'd still vote for Cool league of ponies
he has white text in a grey box
Same here Ponies47
just for the joke
Tomtom, who is tom?
The joke only you get.
reason to have it semi-public would be to get bonuses faster
Canadian_Brony holy shit really?
Meanwhile probably
eeyup
yeah whos Tom?
Yeah, it's not a good joke if you're the only one laughing at it.
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Ponies47: Sad to say, my family dislikes me being a brony. They don't do anything about it, just perhaps an evil look and maybe a word in here and there
but review apps in some fashion, or keep herd-minds as a base rank to keep them under control
^ same here
My cousin and work kind of like it, seeing I wrote a fanfic
oh sorry tom didn't know you spoke
Hm
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
soo everyone got EVA but no one got that one
Well, what's the purpose of the guild?
So, it'll be semi-public.
13oh now i see it
:kickbot give me icecream
kirz has implied that there are bonuses involved.
not sure. He has a bot running, but it's only under his name cuz bots need a user. What he actually does . . . IDk. ask a mod
theres no stream?
Oh right it's an abbreviation of clop.
/me Is sad
Also Shizu made an unconscious reference, haha.
time for a bronystate intermission time that my favorit
Oh wait
No
What happens Eulshy?
flutter_spin: WELL TO BAD! You like what you like if they can't handle it to bad! My mom likes me watching the show my dad is just meh and doesn't give a flying feather
13need a k...
I see it now
Dammit
flutter_spin: Did you show them the charity work we do? Or do they find the idea of liking My Little Pony creepy?
Fffff
I actually... enjoy it. My brother has been EXTREMELY busy with the house and family. My friends all got married, had kids, moved away. I work part-time min wage and have loads of free time.
Party Quirks? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcSiCsapb3Q&feature=endscreen&NR=1
dat kick
Keeeeku.
we need 3 more i think
Auto-kick. Refreshing.
cachi01|phone, no stream..
Anyhoo, bonuses are nice but shouldn't the guild be for the sake of Bronystate shenanigans?
Celes_Chere: My mom has her... pet peeves. Not sure what it is about the show, but he hates guns & zombies
There would be shenanigans with or without a guild.
Eulshy watch Whose Line
she* :P I'm tired.
But we have bill duffer the buffer guy!
Meanwhile Shizuka kirzstryfe :D Join to the game!
13A Silly Union Killing All
Well yes but it's more convenient.
Oh haha Shizu
If we name it that Shizu I'm not joining.
Canadian_Brony, whas that?
Hilariously that's appropriate for her :P
Your favourite characters best moment was being eaten by a flock of bird things.
next time i'm making capital letters so people get it at the first try
Eulshy a very funny show which is comprised entirely of improv.
I'm linking skitttttt
No, she has been uber critical ever since I stopped giving her money
*skits
Asuka's best moment was in Rebuild when she was actually useful.
Canadian_Brony, how does one watch it?
13and promptly had a bridge dropped on her
She's useful at some point?
Eulshy youtube
Eulshy click on a link which I post.
Hey, she's coming back.
hey Eulshy
Didn't you see the trailers, Shizu?
hewwo flutter_spin
v
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5myJRlVA7s&feature=relmfu
hey im watching your link now
Getting crushed by a giant hand apparently gives badass points.
13yes
13still got a bridge dropped on her
I wouldn't really know of course, all I've seen of that show are bits of her being a douche and being thoroughly shredded.
it's also against Friends
Shizu, getting a bridge dropped on you means you die.
Out of the series.
some idiot put the two shows on at the same time
0,14see, the Rebuild movies are objectively good
Anyhoo, guilds made for the sake of having a guild don't tend to work well.
0,14but when that scene happened
0,14I flipped out
What, Asuka getting crushed?
Guilds made for friends to have their own little funhouse do.
It was far better in Rebuild than the original.
hahaha. The skier. I love this one.
I mean, dammit that guy wasn't really all that important and I barely cared about him and now he's offed I mean what
Guys G2G to sleep
Cya!
g'night cachi01|phone
what's up
So, are we making a Bronystate guild?
Cupcake Kitten Brigade [PONY]
hi dshannon. The sky, clouds, my roof, Luna~
because how can you not command respect with a guild name like that?
nice
0,14XD
The only other purpose of a guild would be to amass an army of followers and thus gain power.
13Piles Of Noobs Yelling
0,14you could sell cookies
13oh wait that would still be too descriptive of bronystate..
Only Manechat.
0,14Providers Of [something with N] [something with Y]
People Obviously Need yarn ?
I find it kinda funny
that was greast link ever i laughed so hard heh party quircks
13All People Seem To Need Data Processing
13no wait that's OSI layers..
I post them when I finish with my current ep
I still think the Richard Simmons or Yelled Out the Wrong Name in bed were funny
password for the TF2 game?
ponies
13phase's servers are all 'ponies'
Prickly Objects Necessitate Yelping?
13he still needs to name them
those were great
Ok BRB restarting my computer this glitch is annoying the buck outta me -_-
Oh hey guys you want to see a machinama video link?

Hm
Class choice matters
13thought you did play with us
Though as long as we're a balanced team it's fine.
Joining, Shizu?

just have fun after i few round we will yell at you
Anyway, guilds.
And their names.
kirzstryfe nope that was not me
made the guild, you're stuck with it now :P
I vote Cupcake Kitten Brigade [PONY], because 'tis fun.
Oh, okay then. I'm cool with that.
00,03You know not all mods are asleep...
goes straight for Drew
Meanwhile Shizuka you joining ?
For some reason, running anything in Steam at the same time as the GW2 updater is a big no.
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo! Have you been keeping up with my Whose Line?
13hm
you should
it's funny
kirz, you got piss?
ban them all Scoot
the weird line fing wasn't too funny

00,03So no posting stupid video links, you know what I'm talking about...
Yeah I'll be a second.

As in Rating or qaulity?

c'mon, give in
00,03Rating, more like it
wait so that means you can't but we can send video links right?
00,03Just nothing extremely dumb or innapproriate

Canadian_Brony: She has. But her computer is down ATM :<
Canadian_Brony - ...that's a good point, i haven't seen Vi in a while
and that would be why i guess
00,03Violet has computer problems now, dunno when she'll be back up and running
Ponies47 I know that. I've seen her nick in the chat, but she never said anything. I hope she gets it running soon
It's time for: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCK8ZoC0KPI
Well atleast we got ViVi's bro Gigabit and Allerg0. :3
this was my friend EggyMean he makes machinama's and monkey tail productions
Well Allerg0 is his friend (Me and my derps)
Canadian_Brony: Me to. We all miss her :<
05might aswell
hes got awesome videos
05stream
Well, it's fairly dull in here so Imma go to sleep you you all in 10ish hours.

Canadian_Brony: Yeah!
00,03is it... ponies?
yay Wrek streaming
I have only not-liked the stream once, and that was G3.5
nick fixed and there be a stream?
Wrek is my favorite mod
/me Notices Wrek stole the remote "Hey I was watching the buffer show!" D:
Cipher . . . hi! I haven't seen you before.
...so i'm sure someone else has noticed this before, but it's 145am and my mind is doing weird things...
/me 13ist apparently the new wrek, streaming all day
why do 50% of the mods have a nick that starts with an S?
Shizuka your streams have always been my favourite :)
13this is my name .-.
Shizuka: He streamed all day one time. Atleast in my time zone! :D
Canadian_Brony: Kissass.
Couldn't of said it better Meanwhile.
i see wrek talk
Meanwhile - it's a fair point, i don't recognize Cipher either
is it art time?
Meanwhile was that an insult? Cuz I'm laughing at it.
Shizuka es third fav mod
Was that the best you could come up with to try and deflect that accusation?
Ohai Cipher :)
is der a stream yet?
oh boy
here WE GO
so what do you think scootaloo?
Cipher is just Saxy with a different name.
Meanwhile it's the truth. I'm laughing at it and I don't know why.
oh
k
00,03I know you love my streams, Meanwhile :)
Eh?
Oh yeah that's right. :P
Meanwhile atleast now you're trying to piss me off.
I like your streams when Boondocks is on.
And I think Scoots is computer just went out on him agian.
/me trots around
hi Pearly
oh
suddenly, WoW
omg WoW
world of warcraft
Scoot-Scootaloo: Chat derp?
And suddenly Wow.
this is WoW?
05lets hope it works better now than yesterday
00,03Yep yep :(
good god re we watching WOW
What server is that Wrek?
haven't played this in months
/me Hugs Scoot-Scootaloo "It will be ok"
heh my mom plays this
hey there Canadian_Brony
I didn't know Wrek played WoW
I listens a Wrek.
What server are you on Wrek?
alliance scum
05Quek'thalas
05quel*
whoa...Wrek plays WoW
must leave now befor I start listening to Wrek's music.. night all
Oh. Used to play on that server when I played WoW.
what did i miss...
Sweet dreams, Dovah.
Lok'tar ogar Buytoast.
my friend and I once played WoW. We had no bucking clue what we were doing at any point in the game. Our conversations were mainly composed of "What the fuck am I doing?" or "What the fuck are you doing?"
yeah yeah orc orc orc and all that shit
That's usually what I say when I try playing LoL.
im going to start lestining to the mods now
even though i was a troll and not a smelly halfwit
we gave up after and hour and switched to TF2
13only now?
The only game play I ever saw for WoW was becasue of that one South Park episode
that wasn't gameplay
I played WoW for 5 years, stopped after Cata ended.
what in the hell is that
is that the new talent thing?
Yup
Stopped when TBC wasn't fun. And when Wrath wasn't fun. And when Cata wasn't fun.
Wrek what level are you?
Only good thing I've heard about MoP is that I don't have to farm TLPD again.
You played in TBC decided it wasn't for you but tried again in Wrath?
Yup.
my mom actually let me play wow for my first time but she was telling me the little bit of the math stuff
That's just silly.
Resilient and tranquil grip don't work together :/ that makes me a sad...panda
maybe I'll get World of Warcraft: Pandaland
What can I say, I'm easy to convince.
I'll stick to TF2. Then I'll actually know what I'm doing.
so much lag
Guess it's too late to complain about losing my spot.
TF2 is fun, but so few people I know actually play it.
I imagine the lag is mostly us
but I vould be wrong
i play TF2 on the xbox
00,03*
disgusting
Ew.
Kammerjunk just about everypony on Bronystate plays TF2
Moopy: You hatless Irishman.
Canadian_Brony: Yeah, but I meant like in real life.
what it is
oh
00,03.... I play TF2 on Xbox too...
shameful
Cower before my pile of hats.
pfft, Xbox
05Eulshy: max level
Wait you got a xbox scootaloo?
So is doing double monitor with a computer worth it? I'm think about doing that when I get my new computer
Ima Nintendo
and PC
00,03Xbox is wub tier~
Ponies47 - only if you really need it
this the pandaland beta?
Ponies47: I have two 1200x1920 monitors ATM. And yes.
Celes_Chere but im not sad D:

00,03Anyways, I'm off for the night. Night y'all!

Xbox is for those who want to pay just to access internet
Night Scoot-Scootaloo!

Panda|Doingstuff: I was wondering when you'd catch that :3
Sweet dreams, Scoots.
Oh WoW I only care about you for the statistical and other math problems you give
00,03Moopy: It means that I like playing the xbox -_-
So I don't actually play it

Hi pony_961591 what's up?
Wrek name it rarity!

Athgaar: WoW
I think it's World of Warcraft :P
to be fair there are about a million clones of it
I'm not completely sure because I've never played the game before :3
Moopy :( they arent brutal and arent they a parody band? I dont they exist outside of the cartoon right? I mean it wasnt a band before the cartoon.
out of seeing it on southpark, I've never seen WoW gameplay
wow dude just.......wow
Polydunami: Cookies! I coudl never do that. My guess whould be I would pass out! :D
*could
Wrek ugh, try dealing with a graphics card which never accepts its proper driver.
no wait, forgot about that leeroy video
well, second time seeing gameplay
It's okay, Ponies47; you have to be at least eighteen to give blood anyway :P
Moopy correct me if I'm wrong, I could be misinformed, which is a commonality with me.
heh wish i could
Moopy I couldnt have been dead right. considering I do not watch the show.
05yay there's a driver update
Panda|Doingstuff and Moopy if you two are going to fight can you please take it to PM?
