Umm...I dunno.
and it ain't porn
it's cosplay
I think it is.
how did this get to porn o.O
11,02Hard controlled?
11,02Not really
people would be much more peacful if they were Asexual
for me it's the moment a genital is present in the pic it's porn
haha
Hey everypony O_O
I personally don't try to define porn.
are*
there is this thing we call tasteful nudity. that aint porn either
dem
Yup that's how it's spelled
As I said, the world is REALLY lose on words atm, due to saturation and subjectiveness, thereby causing misunderstanding based on tecnical terms.
And that's...World is Lose
loose*
porn is stupid
waaat?
it is not
over*
when I went to italy, I remember seeing all the nekkid statues.Being 9 at the time, I laughed extrememly hard at each one.
to die*
Okay, enough talk about porn=/= Nudity/genitals etc etc, Let's get back to within realms of the rules here, would we? :P
I wasn't even paying attention to the conversation.:D
Hold up both of you finishing a mission.
The pic had nothing suggestive
I like how we had a stream of doom before this
/me do be do be do be
guys, the picture was a pinup. at most. those are not porn. there is nothing to discuss
Images tells words. P
Seriously, why are we still on this topic?:D
well, actually there is a lot to discuss, but that steers off into different directions
If you want to argue, PM each other.
Oh yeah if you wanna know how freshman only day went for me. PM me O_O
Ok I'm hosting just wait.
neither is mine
no stream?
o there we go
i had to refresh lol

Maybe his skull was made of jello
hello every one
11,02WindWhistler: :<
:
watgeim?
The mechanics are the EXACT same
Now I'm curious *openstream
Luigi's Mansion was different.
I really, really enjoyed Bleach, and I was worried it was just going to get to Inuyasha levels of "This should've ended years ago."
I thoguht she died
Aah
I haven't seen the last one
wat? are we seriously talking about twilight now?
Aah
FUN FACT : that witch is actualy a boy
Arrancar, that's the arc I dropped at, yeah.
In the manga, I never watched much of the anime.
Which get old REALLY fast
11,02Waluigi
lol
Hi
is
Now Luigi's Mansion...that was something completely different
*Hello*
Now they're just remaking the same old games...
It's forgivable if the series is only a couple of games
But this series has been around for like...20 years
One Piece > Bleach
Everyone has different opinions. There's always going to be diagreement one way or another.
Hehehe
Hat: *facepalm*
OMG LUIGI'S MANSION 2 PREVIEW!?
How was Luigi's Mansion 2?
Fairy Tail is still somehow worse than Bleach though.

Hmm or maybe just get a legendary pack for it if I get it...
Poof

Molestia>celestia
It would be weird if they internalized everything

I like Luna a little more than Celestia
and a luna plushie
and they shall be all adorable on my desk :D
urk
Luna is a cute plushie
simple
fanon bullshit
:D
you do realise Luna has far more canon details than celestia
we have a whole backstory for luna
hi
Celestia shouldn't meddle in the business of mortals, her backing off kinda makes sense
if they ever make another NMNight episode i wanna see Luna in Sheperd's armor :D

They are republic though, aren't they? Socialist or not
Communism 4th best thing on earth
Communism doesnt imply non-democracy. Republic doesnt have to = democracy.

Socialism is beautiful
Is someone dissing democracy?
I thought politics weren't allowed
becuase when you diss democracy...
YOU DISS MURIKA
Socialism is democratic
pfft, 'Merica
Political discussions never end well.

We're part socialist, but not enough, dentist still too expensive for many

/me 0,5has never been on 4chan :D
do itt!
now
0,5Naaw
no pun intended
Has anyone here ever bought a Rainbow Dash plushie? And I don't mean the really crappy ones that look like crap. I'm talking about a perfectly made plushie that resembles RD in every way. Sadly the high priced ones.

deviantart is worse than 4chan and it doesn't wran you
I like the show but I don't buy merch

And only be like $20.
Rex_Mund honestly i didnt know furries liked anthromorphic creatures for any other reason than sexual ones, but thats just me being ignorant
beautiful
D:
I could donate. :)
I dont mind furries, the ones ive met are Very nice people.
I'll try to find it for you
Are you kidding me?...
no
I'll find it
$2750...
0,5Who the fuck
0,5would pay that much for a plushie
nearly 3K for a plushie?
really?
3k for a doll
$2275*
^
Aw D:
/me pussied out
ugh
They are all fuzzed about that when it's normal?
that's barely more reasonable
0,5Yeah, uh.... that's not worth $2000 +
I buy my pony merch with pride :D
0,5Even if it's physically worth that much, it's not mentally worth it
bidding war?
dunno, but he must've been rich
probably some neckbeard in his mom's house surrounded by his other plushies
0,5Crimson: I dont screw around :3
Noooooooooooooooo totally nooooot
^
0,5That's $2000 that could have been spent on like, food, or clothes, or payments. Or stashed for savings.
Lol!!
0,5Buytoast has the right idea
Anyone here up for some advanced MvM?
I don't want a cheap one, but I don't want to go into a $500 investment to buy it either.
0,5You know how many hookers I can hire wi- wait...
I'm saving up to buy a gaming computer.
If i had the money id buy a damn accordion.... Such a fun looking instrument :D
er, lemme rephrase that
I don't want laptop
I want a desktop
0,5That reminds me of the time I was playing Skyrim and I bought an enchanted mace for S9000+ and never used it.
:o
goddamn francis
Yeah
0,5Rex you're wrong
point?
I'm excited. :3
0,5Im too lazy to explain in detail
0,5Furries like furry things
I think "Cloppers" are like furries. O.o
Let's not mention those people.
0,5I think cloppers is a really bad term. :/
:D
*ask
Ponies are quite feral
0,5I don't mind NSFW at all, but I don't "clop" nor am I "clopper."
Oh O.o

I'm guessing it's the same style as the intro videos though
"Look at all the buttons!"
SfM ponies on a fart compertition
Oh there were no buttons.
There was, however, a COLOURED BAR.
yeah, Stormbluff Isle, was one of the only US servers that wasn't capped on the first day
And then it was full!
And then I LOGGED IN!
runs medium pop I think, which is good
It was exciting.
Fun fact: wow backwards is platypusdinosaurwordijustinventedandnomayonnaiseaintaninstrument
Alright Every pony. This is all I have to say right now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMaBta4SxI
i've seen gw2 screenshots
yeah >.<
(for tonight)
13i see
Professionaaaal.
:( I couldn't find a good clip
that they do
I'm done watching stream :P
. . .
as in, it just stopped?
>__>
Fine. I instantly thought of it when the stream ended, but couldn't find a clip of it
Only the extremes of hunger and fatigue could create this.
oh
okay
mmm watchaaa saaay
gotta remember that
when you do start though, never underestimate a Skale
darn
Skale?
bipedal fish things
can regen health like crazy if you don't finish them off
have a Hoedown http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB1CLbEewU&NR=1&feature=endscreen
hide and seek is best kiñling song
Killing*
topic of the hoedown
Pfft.
they probably just took their time
Skale are pansies.
thought about it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIIwwCi2zwk check this one out (its long, but funny)
and built it as they go
I went through them like a weedwhacker.
Mmmmmmmm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLyzscHXtWM&feature=youtube_gdata_player
unlike something like swtor which was $200,000,000 spent on overpaid contractors
I remember that from years ago
i want to try gw2 :(
Dear sister is an old meme...
Its a meme right
Right?

The server doesn't like you. o.o
Weeeird phone is weird
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO7tseyAMF0 another one

If you really want to have fun, though, try League of Legends.

The ULTIMATE patching experience, and it's ABSOLUTELY FREE.
Huehuehue.
Ponies let me send u pic

/me quickly hides his ponies

lol
Auditore
oh oh Assassins Creed
I'm bad with personal names
That's just sick -_-
G
I cannot think of any concievable use for ponies other than watching them out of amusement.
I suppose, were they larger, one might ride them as a form of transport.
Incredibox?
its a sound mixer type of application
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02dX6VexfcA&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=55&feature=plpp_video
Thx.for the eargasm spade

Why can't I play Half-Life 2?
eargasm is a good thing
weird
13http://youtu.be/Nq1nC4RVF28

Well, there's me.
I'm trying to figure out if I'm actually on the server or not.

Nobody's going to steal it.
You wouldn't download a police officer!
Pinkie dancing like gandam
Bah
Even if they do it'll leave a spot open.
IE is Chrome's bitch
IE is the best browser for downloading another browser.

Never use IE and is good in the same sentence
It should be
Um
Shoot I'm bad at this.

the League of justice!

the pony's face is all...wat
PONYCEPTION?
He doesn't use Bing either.
13guild name?
yeah
13guild of ponies
Make it
The Technicolour Pony Brigade.
That, or the Steel Rangers because reference.
13flaming fist
13because baldurs gate
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=jh2qIkqx-0A
Oh, we're going to be like that then.

um
Shoot
0,14The Buster WOlves
I'm all out of reference NO SAXY
Busted Wolves
Nah, I gotta get some UNIX learning done.
*like
0,14the Kewl Kids Club?
http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d4ymirp my OC
*Klub
-.-
The overall cool guys guild?
Okay, looking up references. Again.
League of Extraordinary Gentlefolk.
yep no one got it or most are just ignoring it
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid my fanfic plug
I'd suggest the Gurren Brigade but fuck no.
Oh
:p
http://generalzoi.tumblr.com/post/28132018204/pony-creator-update
Fight Club?
13Equine Victory Alliance
going with an iconic name sets bad standards for the guild, I've found
/me is uber procrastinating on his fanfic.
heh. I've been working on my fanfic ever since Season 2 ended
my third one, that is
13Equine Victory Alliance
I think I'm up to about 70,000 words total
I shoot for 1,000 words a day (roughly)
/me is procrastinating on 4 fanfics...at once
/me Has never wrote a fanfic
/me has never uploaded a fanfic.
/me was planning on doing a fanfic
/me is too lazy
/me wonders about all of the actions
of course, I have to find the damn guild registrar again first
I'm still planning my fic
I don't know how to start it off
Damn we suck at naming things.
i,can give you my story if you want superretworld
My writing keeps improving. Yes, I've included the mods here in my story, especially S-U-M-.. well you know
>iPhone
>Flash
Hm
Equine Victory Alliance [PONY]
Hah, no.
?
:3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH72I1NmxWg
They shun the idea.
If we put up a pony name, we'll be flooded with membership requests.
13kirz only still has hop here because inertia is a property of matter
Me? I like to write. I did fanfics for WoW, LotR, Star Wars...
you can also do the little code....
!cd
That was my assumption as well.
I've seen him actually talk once.
same
*has
i'd still vote for Cool league of ponies
just for the joke
The joke only you get.
reason to have it semi-public would be to get bonuses faster
Yeah, it's not a good joke if you're the only one laughing at it.
!cd
but review apps in some fashion, or keep herd-minds as a base rank to keep them under control
^ same here
My cousin and work kind of like it, seeing I wrote a fanfic
Hm
!cd
soo everyone got EVA but no one got that one
Well, what's the purpose of the guild?
13oh now i see it
theres no stream?
Oh right it's an abbreviation of clop.
/me Is sad
Oh wait
No
13need a k...
I see it now
Dammit
Fffff
I actually... enjoy it. My brother has been EXTREMELY busy with the house and family. My friends all got married, had kids, moved away. I work part-time min wage and have loads of free time.
dat kick
Keeeeku.
we need 3 more i think
Auto-kick. Refreshing.
13A Silly Union Killing All
Well yes but it's more convenient.
Hilariously that's appropriate for her :P
I'm linking skitttttt
No, she has been uber critical ever since I stopped giving her money
*skits
Asuka's best moment was in Rebuild when she was actually useful.
13and promptly had a bridge dropped on her
She's useful at some point?
Hey, she's coming back.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5myJRlVA7s&feature=relmfu
13yes
13still got a bridge dropped on her
I wouldn't really know of course, all I've seen of that show are bits of her being a douche and being thoroughly shredded.
it's also against Friends
Out of the series.
some idiot put the two shows on at the same time
0,14see, the Rebuild movies are objectively good
Anyhoo, guilds made for the sake of having a guild don't tend to work well.
0,14but when that scene happened
0,14I flipped out
Guilds made for friends to have their own little funhouse do.
Guys G2G to sleep
Cya!
what's up
nice
0,14XD
The only other purpose of a guild would be to amass an army of followers and thus gain power.
13Piles Of Noobs Yelling
Only Manechat.
0,14Providers Of [something with N] [something with Y]
13All People Seem To Need Data Processing
13no wait that's OSI layers..

Anyway, guilds.
And their names.

Oh, okay then. I'm cool with that.

"Bloodhound trained to sniff out complete idiots"

I played WoW for 5 years, stopped after Cata ended.
Yup
Stopped when TBC wasn't fun. And when Wrath wasn't fun. And when Cata wasn't fun.
Only good thing I've heard about MoP is that I don't have to farm TLPD again.
You played in TBC decided it wasn't for you but tried again in Wrath?
Yup.
That's just silly.
Resilient and tranquil grip don't work together :/ that makes me a sad...panda
