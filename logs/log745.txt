how've you been Sketch+Toku_Brony
i'll pm you on that
“If it exists, there is a pony of it. No exceptions.”
"The website rulesoftheinternet.com[14] has listed it as a sub-rule of Rule 34."
" On Urban Dictionary, searching for ponify redirects to the entries for Rule 42[22] and Rule 85[15], which are also referenced in the Tv Tropes entry."
That website is wrong

13not terribly limited
mrs cake*
13it's in the hundreds at least
Orders Recieved
13but we have lots of bans
I'm sure half of the bans where meme related
stairs and sombreros
13many of them are just old
13the +L you see in the channel modes gives us access to a much longer list of bans, but when it comes to episode premieres we can even run up against that
3? 5? i donno
Anyone watch kyrospawn?
wut?
what's that?
is there a limit on temp bans?
or are all bans counted the same?
Temp bans are just bans that we remove at some point. :P
there can be no end
for instance say hi to my other irssi on my server
i've seen temp bans that lead up to december 31st 9999
13observe
please no

13anyway
13and now you know:3
Hi everypony!
I'm nood too.

13the one downside to irssi is manually unbanning
13dari and the others use clients that put bans in a nice list you can click on

it still remembers my name!

rails is too bitchy.
it needs to relax like php.
also i want Larson as plotmaker for next episodes
it's all about time best for me

i know i just needed to here this
Indestructable isnt correct tho, physics says anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough.

11,02Or they're using the extra money to buy the extra storage
13ancient tech
:)
Can't use it as a bluray player though
11,02It's not a blu-ray disc though
DEFINTALY
^
11,02It's similar but a proprietary format
hence nintendo/sony stores :0
11,02But having the ability to plug in a huge amount of storage without forcing users to only use built-in storage was a good move on Nintendo's part.
I like the idea of the wii u though but I'm not getting it anytime soon

11,02Bronysith: Again, it eouldn't exist without Nintendo's help.
11,02wouldn't*
hey everypony :)
11,02Really?
really
during the holidays I presume
:P{
:) hey
Consoles does make it cheaper for us to buy gcards though
if you look at it this way: Console keeps game-specs down
^
13Bronysith: you just now learned?
well it should be looks like it has some good launch games
:I
Ikr?
11,02But the size of the components hasn't changed drastically which is amazing imo
not a war per se
13right, because tech has improved since then, it's just wii u is *just now* catching up
I'm going with the flow here
13sony's apparently crashing hard, i'll be impressed if there is a PS4
Playstation 4
i think xbox is leaving the gaming race
We'll just have to wait and see, it wouldn't be the first console to vanish
I think the ps3 and Xbox 360 is slowly dying now
I've yet to personally try it though
but doesnt matter to me, i have my playstation 3 mostly for games i find on the PSN, AKA Legend of dragoon, FFVI-VIII, persona 3 later on
We have a PS3, but I haven't touched it in ages
13but that's the thing
/me does not have over 1080, does not want over 1080
Personally? Just a computer
13it's holding the medium back
It is holding back in certain departments yeah
Especially controll, feedback and graphics is being held down by porting
yeah, consoles are a bigger market-
13you had to use a trainer to force it higher
Jeez-
13i already have that one silly
11,02So think of it this way, do I want to go out and built an $800+ computer to play CoD or buy an Xbox 360 for $250.
11,02Plus convenience and simplicity factor in a lot with buying a concole.
dem mods
13if you're building a computer over $800, you're not building it for COD
^]
13if you want to build a computer for COD you buy a system from 2004
That reminds me, I need a horse mod for Skyrim- their butts are all wrong

I can run several crysis'es ontop of eachother
I some times try to run SWTOR and EVE Online at the same time. Good gracious, TOR can eat resources.
13i do not sit six feet from my monitor, i don't need to look at the screen like it's a telescope
but that's a dev-argument more than a consumer one
I do like that we are not bashing each other :)
Exactly
it's not good unless you have multicore or sli/cf
I mean multicore GPU
I don't use two monitors, never saw the point, did before- but now I have a U824 soundcard- and the mixer takes up the entire screen
like 690
Oh.
Nothing
13only during streams
13in which case stream on 1, irc on 2
Good point.
For streaming and modding I would want two screens
I haven't bout glasses in 3 years
modding as in administrating
Bought
We used three screens in the main studio at my school, but we only used the center one <,<

Well this just goes over my head
GPU: Intel Chipset G43/G45 (very weak)
I used to have E7200 OC
13ouch
I'm not walking up to my computer to tell you my specs.
i7 2600 3.4ghz 16gb ram, 1tb hdd, GTX670, U284 Audio
ok, battlestation parade?
yeaaaaaaaa no
Ikr
Yeah- not that good
works, though
13well at least you're getting all 4GB of ram

:P
Yep
Hen...shin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D79FpFkAV84 :D
lol
Lol
thats a pretty decent sized crowd.
You should rent it for just yourself once anyway :P
they kind of made me mad
I was going to do something cool, like let everyone vote via text message for the next episode
but they don't allow you to just plug a laptop in
you need to burn them a disc and they play it.
its retarded.
even made an OC based on him :$ http://kamenartistsamueru.deviantart.com/gallery/39025865#/d5bhwet
=/
what's their reason for that?
because stupid.
Weird I'm participating >.>
of course
"devilish grin"
they also make you pay licensing fees
for anything thats not currently being shown at their theater
13asuka's maxed out due to the motherboard, but phenom II x6 at 2.4GHz, 8GB ram, 1.5TB internal plus 2TB external drive, and 1GB radeon hd 5750 running two monitors
which is like an hour away
5750? i used to have one of those
I suck at reading ATI names-
nice cards
take a beating
oh wow, that I've never seen
13that would be intel
Intel sucks
It's a shadow-bug, isn't it? I've seen it a few times, many times actually
13black textures on their own is intel
also
topic
intel makes great cpus but they suck with gpus
"rip dad"
ohh, okay
Amd makes alright cpus but great gpus, see the pattern
Hmm
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/46282/the-people-you-see-at-a-midnight-release
aww :(
integrated seems to be mainly for 2d acceleration for UI- running games on it is kinda crazy
Wow I've been more interested in this than Skyrim
though nvidia makes the best gpus, thats a fact
13nvidia's stomping AMD into the ground, i only picked up the radeon build because it was cheaper than the comparable nvidia
13now and then i regret it
Skyrim
Hello :)
GTX670 is something I--don't regret buying, but honestly, I could not seee any improvement in games
08,01or rather, it has been historically
13for me it was a huge improvement from the geforce 8300gs i'd been stuck on for two years
Yes
is there any stream going on ???
I can't remember the name of my old card
To be honest
The biggest improvement I felt was when I upgraded from P4 3.2ghz to i7 3.4
It's on my things to do list
is there any stream going on ???
...when was actually the last stream?
Dual takes out quite a lot huh? I haven't had dual since... well, years
13it's not a lot as far as i can tell
I don't name anything. Well except I named my iPad awesome >.>
13screen two is generally just putty and skype, and while putty is constantly updating to demonstrate the network connection is still live, it's not exactly crysis on screen two
whats putty
13ssh client
if I had two, I would want to run eh dspmixer or something on the second-
oh, here's that poster i got http://i.imgur.com/RxGqn.jpg?1

They're really going all out with the merchandising

AOL still exists?
why not both
/me 13says as she still hasn't cracked open this coke from when she woke up...
alright
13jbh1145: parts, newegg
i wish they had more toys and such from when the first trilogy was going on
:3
They had some... I never found much though
Computers aren't as scary to put together as it might look, I learned it at a pretty young age
13$800 for these specs, was normally just under 1k
oh, sprunkls isn't here ;3;
I have a plush and an inflatable from the state fair with like 50 holes in it
i5 or i7?
I think it's still in my closet at my parents' house
Lol no, it was just flimsy and broke for no reason
hahaha
hey everyone
13they had an i7 with nvidia for i think $900, but that was 2010 and seems the prebuilts cycle out fairly quickly
and magically got 50 holes in it.
they dont have the x6 on newegg
it's called hyperbole :P
I got a i7, as it wasn't that expensive when I did
11,02Biggestpinkiefan: Watch the spoilers please
http://i.imgur.com/OChA9.jpg
although I did make it much worse by trying to fix the holes...

"I need an idea for an OC and name"
"CanHurr Smashdick"
yes, great suggestion..
Also kind of a random thought. People say she live in Cloudsdale but she can't fly....
"SHITLORD THE ALMIGHTY, HIS CUTIEMARK IS SHIT"
I always thought cloudsdale was too far away for her to live there and go to that school
"you have tits?"
"very manly tits"
I like Crippleloo though
...wtf?
Makes sense
11,01Hi.
Yo, dawg
"And don't say you're already at home.
the same OC thread.
I would be terrified that I live near those people
Hehe
wow ponies are on
Because that certainly isn't the case nowadays."
or "future" things
11,02Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.

Booyah
