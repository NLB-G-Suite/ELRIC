DocSane: twilight and biker mice from mars
Slater: learn anything on RWBY?
say that again >:I
O.O
/me spits it out
I'm scared .-.
Vordox: But really, the suit is a legit one. They argue that Blizzard's not doing enough to prevent hacking (which is true) and that their default answer of "just get an authenticator" is requiring the purchase of another product in order to bring their product reasonable security.
Nittany_Discord: Halo 4
Depressed crystal ponies r CUTE.
Twilight? Seriously? Fracking TWILIGHT?!
SB will save me \:3/
Gunthler: say that again >:I
CriticKitten: Eeeyup
Gunthler: SAY THAT WORD AGAIN.
SB HALP O.O
As I said, I have my opinion, but I do not disagree
Vordox: If Blizzard had just sent the game with an authenticator on hand, they'd have been fine. But no, they CHARGE you for it. That's *stupid*.

Again.. I'm new here, so does anyone care to explain what happens what we usually do, etc.?
Dear Trixie..
AVADA KEDEVERA.
DemoPegono: why?
Heverin: Have you read the FAQ and Rules? :)
Yeah..
FOR SENDING LUNA TO THE MOON! * flips table *
DemoPegono: She regrets doing that, and it tore her up inside, Faust said so
Heverin: welcome to bronystate :) we usually see some mods stream some stuff like games,art,movies,series, or just music and random youtube vids :8
:)
... then... she needs a hug.
Heverin: That basically explains Bronystate.
DemoPegono: yes she does
/me hugs Celestia for a damned good reason
DemoPegono: Does it matter that "Luna" was going to plunge the world into eternal night?
DemoPegono: but everything is fine now
I
Heverin: every friday we have a movie night
'am just a major Luna fan.
Lunar republic ftw
Oh, well I was just wondering how everyone acts around here.
DemoPegono: me too
solan inquisition booooooooooo

Zubat is a very annoying Pokemon..
cachi01: Solan? :D
zubatman
solan?
oh damn.
... she's smexy. XD
uhmm
Shizuka: Just watched the whole thing. Best ever
DocSane: she got taken over by corruption magic
solan is just fancy way of saying solar Z_Z
Likely story. :P
O.O
DocSane: that is my theory anyway
confound this kickbots
Jageman: Or something. Remember, everything is possible till the show declares it otherwise.
/me Laughs at cachi01
/me throws muffins at Ponies47

i'll be back later guys :)

/me laughs maniacallyuk,ztfhbcuhb
Bye, RDash5000. :)
Bye RDash5000
I am looking forward to seeing AJ and Rarity turned into little kids. The comedy potential with the CMC involved will be high.
cya RDash5000 :)
Bye RDash5000
DocSane: cant wait for g1 pinkie pie :D
hey SaxyPretender
Ohai SaxyPretender. :)
DocSane: Faust mentioned somthing about her being corrupted but also said it was not her call
/me is pretty fly for a human guy
Hi SaxyPretender :)
/me beats up a jawbreaker
cachi01: There is no G1 Pinkie Pie, since she was created for G3.
All the fillies say

THIS WILL BREAK ANY SECOND NOW!
0,14oh hai peoples
DocSane: but there was a surprise for G1, no?
/me has been beating it up for 10 hours
DemoPegono: OH SHI-
Jageman: Faust hasn't worked on the show for about a year now. She created the sandbox and wrote the rules for play, but the other kids are building castles in it now.
hi SaxyPretender
Everyone keeps saying Ga-
Jageman: Yeah, but she wasn't like Pinkie.
hi SaxyPretender
Oh hai SaxyPretender
DocSane: true
BREAK ALREADY!
My Little Pony meets Harry Potter..
How do you spell it, even? Is it spelled Gac
DinkyDoo: my inmortal mlp version?
Jageman: That face Pinkie made was definitely a G3 face, which makes Rarity and AJ's reaction that much funnier.
yes. yes it is, ShadowQuill.
DocSane: i think it was a g1
GuntherDW: Thanks for confirming
Who else think Pinkie Pie would be awesome as a pegasus
Jageman: Because Surprise
surprise¡
I think she's fine as an earth pony. :)
^
Jageman: I would love it if Pinkie Pie was a pegasus.
DocSane: ya, g3 was just wrong
she is not an earth pony
neither a unicorn
or a pegasus
she is a pinkie pie
Oh
G1 was MLG~
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Diary of a Silent Tyrant
0,14that's an insult to G1, Scoot-Scootaloo
They were originally gonna make Pinkie Pie a Pegasus, but they decided to make her a Earth Pony and gave her wings to Fluttershy.
0,14you apologize right now
G1 O3O
SLAPPITY SLAP!
At least he didnt say that about G2
whats it this time?
or i woulda been pissed off
you have fucked up now
I thought G2 was only toys, right?
,pp[
G2 sucked
Now you fucked up
DinkyDoo, you mean she has in Lauren
AJIsAwesome: G2 had a show
moop...
Or did it have a show?
pony teens....
Without G1, there wouldn't be any My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.
SaxyPretender: Oh yeah well you're an insult to MLG's >: (
oh god
all the last generations were dogshit.
cachi01: true. She can teleport and see the future, would make sense that she was a genetic mutation
g1 was fine
I thought the ponies in school were technically still G1.
g2 sucked
G1 is mah second favotite :3
AJIsAwesome: It was only toys. Most people mistakenly call My Little Pony Tales G2.
g3 is bullshit
g3.5 is satan's work
0,14Good, MLG sucks, yo :3
g3.6 <3
:>
0,14If I'm insulting it, I'm doing something right!
What will be G4.5 or G5?
THANK YOU!!!
when I say My Little Pony, people think im talking about the last generation shit.
Honestly, most of MLP has always been kind of terrible.
What about Littlest Pet Shop? Dat show is awesome! 030
Saxy's got the right idea!
WHO HERE PLAYED ME3?
its not as good
G4.5 the CMC adventures
cachi01: Just imagine all the genetic codes it takes for a single species to have so much variations.
what game is being played?
ShadowQuill: http://www.luxlotus.com/photos/ya_lyublu_i_love_russian_/russianvogue_pinkpony.jpg
CrimsonPhoenix: I wouldn't mind that.
ShadowQuill: thats g5
CrimsonPhoenix: Dat would be cool
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSGWoXDFM64 <--- For those who played ME3... Is this song familiar to you?
CMC vs Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Agreed, DocSane.
what game is being played?
the buffer show
YAY
Suddenly, BronyState is thread simulator! What do?
I remember when the fans really disliked the CMC.
There is no stream..
There is none, RhinoSquadPony.
It's all over
Dat buffer show O3O
DinkyDoo: cmc would lose
I wub the Buffer show :3
i love buffer show

ShadowQuill, not everyone in here visit 4chan
ShadowQuill: laugh my ass off

Night Nittany_Discord
Night Nittany_Discord :)
g'night Nittany_Discord
CrimsonPhoenix: I just watch thread simulators
Man, I swear. If the CMC don't get their cutie marks soon, it's gonna be awkward if their voice actors grow into young women, and their characters are still little fillies who are STILL trying to discover themselves.
Nighty night Nittany_Discord
ShadowQuill, IWTCIRD
Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every townPonies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be foundMaybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair
Kandarihu: VA are 13-15
AJIsAwesome: when we find out Mips kidnapper, right?
ShadowQuill, I hope you mean the good 50 seconds one
Kandarihu: years old*
for taste BEAR?!
the rest are all stupid
HAKU IS BACK
DocSane: ya
Kandarihu: so that is not going to happen soon
CrimsonPhoenix: Which one is that?
thelonepony: We do? :O
I'll link it to you in PM
AJIsAwesome: believe so
/me Dances
:3
Sweet! :3
/me dances with Ponies47 :3
cachi01, so they were about 10-12 when they started?
Folks, we have to be realistic: if there is a series 4, it'll probably be the last one.
That the key that they need to solve this sad cider shortage you and I will share
Well you've got opportunityIn this very community
Kandarihu: i think so
/me jumps into the teleporter and teleports to the chat room
DocSane: The Simpsons?
I hope they dont pull a Simpsons and keep the show in 30 years from now
The Cannon overloaded

*^^
ShadowQuill: The Simpsons is barely watchable now. I haven't watched it in years.
and im 14......... yay theres hope lol
Hes flim hes flam we're the world famous flim flam brothers!! (I wanted to say this..)
That tears it. They MUST get their Cutie Marks this season! They've been stagnating too long

:D
Nonpareil, and that's exactly the reason why, you seeNo pony else in this whole place will give you such a chance to be where you need to beAnd that's a new world, with tons of ciderFresh squeezed and ready for drinking
Everyone knows what the CMC's talents are. Everyone except themselves.
Jageman: you just glomped :3

Bye, RhinoSquadPony. :)

More cider than you can drink in all your days of thinking!
Jageman: well, thats what a glomp is, a tackle hug :3
I doubt that!
and saw the third season:D
I can totally imagine a filly getting stuck into an arranged marriage situation and her cutie mark becoming the face of her betrothed if she ever accepts the marriage as her fate.
thelonepony: Have you ever been glomped in real life, it really hurts
i feel like there's only 4 poeple here

header still says S3 discussions are banned
well then I guess we need to ban literally every one of the 4000 users that were here saturday.
RAWRity: don't think that rule is still active
Hello guiz :P
Hai Socks :3
S3 spoils are still in effect until 24 hours after the episode has aired IIRC
Obviously during the eps they aren't#
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin
I'm just going by what the header says
/me hugs Socks back :)
hello
Question is, how long after the episode airs will the spoiler rule kick in again?
lali-ho!
Hai kimplix :)
hello Brobakiin
...there's a script for spoilers?
Deacon, ...yes

Clearly we should just stick to discussing Gak

gak?
but...what if someone doesn't even say the work and it's still a Spoil?
*word
oh wait, manual kick, nvm
why
why is g.a.k a kick? it's not even s3 related
HAH!
Because mods are trolls
^
Because it was spammed...
And gak sucks
:D
because it got annoying after a day
Gyrobowl is the one true God
^
Gryobowl is a false god, only gek is the true god.
Betch.
pony_330905, it was a forced meme, and it got really annoying.
The G word now counts as spam :D I love the world!
i guess nick is raiding the ad everywhere

mitamaking only if you talk about future episodes which haven't aired
mitamaking: P.arent G.uidance -13

“If it exists, there is a pony of it. No exceptions.”
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Panel Play / Delivery for Derpy H. / Do You Love Me?
" On Urban Dictionary, searching for ponify redirects to the entries for Rule 42[22] and Rule 85[15], which are also referenced in the Tv Tropes entry."

Heels. Painful.

i dont wear heels
I only own one pair of heels and its for formal events
i would break my neck.. sorta not good on balance..

If you say **k on BronyState, doesn that result in ban?
Only a kick.

/me huggles Vordox "There there."
13Dumori is the only other user in the last three months that uses the same network this twit is using

Each circle is like a different gradient.
RELEASE ME, FIEND!

Hi, Good afternoon everyone
Hello there TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Hello!
good evening
sup TheGreatAndPowerfulT
how've you been kimplix
hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
i've been good
13bronystate i have a task for you
yes?
/me salutes at Shizuka
how bout you alexxm?
what up Shizuka ?
o.o A task?
SEEK OUT THE HOBBITS
The black screen... it's... so...
Dark.
i'm good kimplix
BRING THEM AND THE RING.
nice to know alexxm
13if anyone sees Dumori or Dumorimasodaa anytime soon, ask him if he used a mobile irc last month and if so which network
:D
Will try and remember
anyway, where was i....
ah
13and/or if anyone hears Dumori say he's banned, pass it along to us because he should be exempted while on that network
how come Shizuka
The "i" in mips is orange.
While the rest are blue.
13hopefully it's the last we see of the twit that kept evading today
13now to free up some ban slots
The ".tv" is orange too.
i got the applejack, applebloom, big mac, mr carrot cake, mrs carrot cake, pinkie, octavia, spitfire, dj pon-3, miss cheerlie, snips and bon bon
there's limited ban slots??
13not terribly limited
mrs cake*
13it's in the hundreds at least
Orders Recieved
13but we have lots of bans
Smiles08, "Your powers of observation continue to serve you well."
why did i say mrs carrot cake is a mystery
Sombra likes stairs.
I'm sure half of the bans where meme related
stairs and sombreros
13many of them are just old
13but a permanent ban is a permanent ban
indeed
13the +L you see in the channel modes gives us access to a much longer list of bans, but when it comes to episode premieres we can even run up against that
what is the maximum amount of time a temporary ban can last?
Forever minus a day
3? 5? i donno
wut?
what's that?
is there a limit on temp bans?
or are all bans counted the same?
Temp bans are just bans that we remove at some point. :P
13if by temp ban you mean a time ban, we remove those, or have timers on our clients that automatically do
there can be no end
so temp bans count towards the ban limit?
for instance say hi to my other irssi on my server
i've seen temp bans that lead up to december 31st 9999
13only so long as they're active
13observe
Dat Asuka
please no
:D
13and in ten seconds you'll see my client unban
10
13ten longest seconds ever amirite
yup
and poof!
wb
XD
Welcome back Asuka :D
seems more than 10 seconds btw
i should register or group this but i don't have any bot work planned
i've counted
I though you were going to make an example out of me.
I got scared
13mfw irssi doesn't accept message on /quit
Lawl Jageman
13anyway
13and now you know:3
/me sits in a corner and tries to calm down.
Hi everypony!
hi DinkyDoo
I'm nood too.
hello dinkydoo
DinkyDoo: Hi dinky
*noob
See, can't even spell.
Hello Jageman, Kimplix, and BladedWings :)
._.
Ohai DinkyDoo
13the one downside to irssi is manually unbanning
well that was a fast admin
Heya DinkyDoo :)
AdamTheDuck: doing stream again, join if you like ^^
/me licks Sonny :P
13dari and the others use clients that put bans in a nice list you can click on
Hi AdamTheDuck and MLP_Brovakiin
Sonny, nah I'm heading off to school soon
/me licks AdamTheDuck
ok bye
o...k
does this chat room have auto kicking?
Shizuka: quit does take a message
yes
bye AdamTheDuck
13yeah but irssi doesn't pass it along
try saying g.a.k without the dots
it still remembers my name!
Nah.
irssi?
Was there a stream before I came?
13/quit foo! resulted in [14:56] *** Asuka [asuka@r-70-62-149-175.hsd5.mn.comcast.net] has quit [Client Quit]
Quake 4 was last night
g&a&k
No dots, see?
ga kupo
u'll be surprised what will happen
Well anyway, another relaxing song for everyone before I head off. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkwVjUseLEU
And I bid you farewell BronyState. :)
Good bye :)
13though irssi's man says that /quit does take a message....
Sweetie Bell scares me now..
13maybe just doesn't like bangs..
http://derpy.me/ucYXh
guess that would qualify as a bug Shizuka
did anyone listen to the backgeound music of s3?
YES.
background*
Goodbye AdamTheDuck :)

That buffer circle is going round... and round...
13doesn't seem to pass the quit message into the command
13that's odd
Is Jageman still here?
DinkyDoo: Ya

shizumobile: looked up haibane renmei, now I'm intrigued. Thanks for bringing it up :)
Jageman: You prolly went over an access road if you were on the actual dam
Shoot 'em with your zappy gun!
Elevator action
RawketLawnchair: lol is that an Awesome Center reference?
woo!! elevators YEAH!
Is it possible to get over somebody's death?
TROctavia: i don't really remember, I have a damaged memory
Jageman: I've never been to LV though lol. So i'm just going off of what i remember seeing on a map
One of those topics that just comes out of nowhere
It's always the red barrels.
DinkyDoo: only time can heal that wound.
My grandpa has died last year, and i'm still not over it.
Wait woah, what game is this??
quake
DinkyDoo: its different for everyone, take all the time you need
My grandpa's death didn't leave me a wound, it left me a scar.
forgot the number though
Interesting
Anyone hear the heartbeat
hi RaveBrony! ^_^
Hey there, MahBoi777! : D
and you probably just filled upm your health from somebodies ballsac
Dat heartbeat
wat
thump thump
Your Heartbeat Song, Its good but its not the one, we're singing out of tune, but I still want to sing with you :D
that'S one big heart
yet it isn't kind
oh hello there ponies
that big heart has a very small heart
hi
6_9
Oh god what
hi IshPonyPonyThePony
hello IshPonyPonyThePony!
Hey IshPonyPonyThePony!
what kind of fool would use organic components when mechanical alternative would be longer lasting
bye everypony
Jageman: strogg would
Hi, RaveBrony. :)
Dark_Horst: oh
Oh just wait
bye IshPonyPonyThePony!
Jageman, it's less expensive and repairs itself
Organic parts were popular in these kinds of games at the time for some reason
Hey AJIsAwesome :P
Prey did it too.
Jageman That's how strogg work. They use organic material for some reason.
short but sweet :)
hi AJIsAwesome^^
Invi: untill it gets sick
Evening, bronies.
hai CountDoofus
Invi: an engineered virus would wipe everything out
ded
oooooh, Quake 4?
Jageman Considering the stroggs extremely advanced technology and all. They no doubt could have ways of preventing organic decay
I broke it, time to run!
Ho Everypony :)
DinkyDoo: You, ok. You seem quiet.
Hi*
Jageman: No, i'm crying right now..
Jageman, how do you know they don't develop an antidote oa vaccine for that
Ho thelonepony! :D
hi thelonepony
MahBoi777: :D
hay thelonepony
Invi: Viruses change and adapt
/me hugs MahBoi777 BladedWings And Invi :3
Heya thelonepony :) *huggles* :3
/me hugs thelonepony back :)
Invi: a good virus would attack the immune system, like hiv
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin :3
I think I got to experience the partial solar eclipse. The only way i could tell was the rooms and the sky were darker than usual
/me hugs DinkyDoo "it'll be ok"
Invi: then a vaccine would not work, because the antibodies would be dead
I'm gonna watch Youtube videos.. youtube makes me happy..
That's what quake 4 has for it. Your guns actually got better and upgraded as you play through it. So it keeps fresh
quake ?
Shizu do you play on PC or Xbox?
Jageman, when you can hype up that virus power that much, a vaccine is able to develop comparable power. and since these aliens are further developed in organic technology than their enemies, they'd have an advantage
Alchemist PC obviously
killerpony7733: obviously? Quake 4 was on Xbox 360 too.
pony_6585: Quake 4
Jaymoo <3
Alchemist Yes but shizu plays on PC
Invi: viruses mutate randomly, they would have to catch it early inorder to keep up
Fluffeh~ <3
Cool<3
You really shouldn't be playing a FPS on anything other than a PC, with a few exceptions
And it's obviously PC if you take your time to notice
I hope you will forgive me abusing give ammo like crazy on this gun
Jageman, wha if they develop a virus for the virus so the countervirus wipes the virus out
i think that'S what crysis 2 did
/me 11,01brushes BRUSHYOURTEETH
viruses are not alive, they can not attack each other, they can only counteract each other in the host cell
Brushie Brushie~
Colgate
that gun is giving me lag :P
Invi: like a virus that makes the host cell immune to the first virus
/me puts Nittany_Discord in an aquafresh maid corset
/me 11,01is fresh
Invi: but then if that virus mutates, you would have two uncontroled viruses running arround
Jageman, yeah but they have the technology to build a giant heart pumping whatever through a living ship. i guess a human engeneered virus wouldnt do much harm
Invi: why not
Invi we don't know what their biolgly's like though i presume
hello everypony
sup ?
Hi, Rocket. :)
Hi Rocket :)
inb4 he ded
Ohai AJIsAwesome :3
hi :)
alexxm: well, they turn humans into cyborgs so we can assume their biology matches ours.
Heya Rocket
Hi, thelonepony! :)
doom?
Invi: the only way i can see a virus being uneffective is if they have a different type of dna
how are things Rocket
pony_numbers: almost
S[runkls, where are you >.>
pony_numbers: Quake 4
Invi: like xna
oh
good thanks, and you ?
Sprunkls*
Jageman, what does the x stand for?
Invi: xeno
that was anticlimatic
Boss fi-oh okay
Invi: "XNA (Xeno Nucleic Acid) artificial replication/transcription polymerases starting generally from T7 RNA polymerase"
Alchemist Actually it's more of using human parts and what not. They sometimes makes things that requires a much larger amount of organic material to fit and all.
Alchemist I think it's cause humans are in a large abundance and all which is why they use em.
Jageman, I see. i just looked up an article about that in rsc.org
Invi: Science is awesome
killerpony7733: hmm, maybe they are using special cells to encourage cell growth (stem cells eg) --y massive, controlled and fine tuned biomasses?
--y = -->
Jageman, indeed
Alchemist: there easier ways to make giant organes
whats in these green boxes ?
barells *
Jageman: yes, but they might not be as fine tuned or compatible.
Stroyent
Which is the green teleport of dead mobs
Alchemist Seems like so. Cause they can grow things like that extremely huge heart. Even a huge brain for that matter. I think they use key human components to make what they want. Like they need the upper torso and the legs just after the knees and head for most things?
:O they can teleporting ?
when they're dead
:3
that have no sense xD
so what do they need this stroyent stuff for?
AHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAH
HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAha
hahhahahaha
Alchemist: they could make an extracellular matrix and flush stem cells through it, that is how researchers are converting dead organs into live ones
Best...NEWS EVER
and why do they teleport corpses away?
http://www.screwattack.com/news/some-pc-copies-black-ops-2-disc-2-are-fact-mass-effect-2
THAT.
IS
Hiiiilaaarioooous!
Oh lawd
Alchemist: they just need a scaffold for the cells to attach to
haha... lol
:)
You thought this was Black Ops? Nope.avi
Vordox: XD
Jageman: like growing skin cells on a charged glass surface?
Alchemist It's kinda like they take things that they know cybernetics can improve and replace it with that. Then add the strogg chip in the brains of those they stroggify and all. Plus their dermal plates which is nailed to their chests so in essence they only improve the base design of a human
:D
EA + Activision
In ONE disc
Alchemist: ya but in a 3d shape, using chemicals that desolve in time
oh god, i finally readed that :)
THAT...is a MASTERPIECE of a one in a million thing
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Dominates Ratings
Alchemist: they could boost growth by using something that desolves into simple organic chemicals that the cells can matabolize for energy
killerpony7733: if they want mechanic/kinetic stability they might just be better off using full blown robots without bioparts. Dont know why would they keep the human parts. Maybe the brain, and some other organs that supports the brain.
Oh man, it would suck to be hit by those things in the conveyor belt
conveyor belts: the game
feels like half life :)
hay MadSurge ^^
Hey Invi :)
Jageman: Cheeseburger in hidrochloric acid?
guys it's just doom, there is no needed to discuting xD
:I
howdy everypony ;)
Hi Michael :3
Alchemist: wat? where did that come from
lol who uses disks now
Hi guys
Hey Michael!
Hi SpadeMagnes[School] :3
And hi SpadeMagnes[School]!
/me hugs thelonepony MadSurge
prey?
ohai MadSurge :3
Heya Michael and SpadeMagnes[School] :)
The more and more I look at it, White Kyurem looks poorly animated than Black Kyurem
This is the superior breed of FPS that thrived before Halo and CoD casualized it to death
ohai SpadeMagnes[School]
Hi, SpadeMagnes[School] and Michael! :)
wow such a big .. pink
thelonepony: :)
Alchemist I do not know. But i think they see a good use for a human body. Maybe cause it's really flexible in it's design? i mean look at kane all the stroggification did to him made him 10x times stronger faster tougher then his peers
White Kyrume?
/me hugs Michael back :3
Ready?
/me hugs MLP_Brovakiin AJIsAwesome
Jageman: well, we have HCl in our stomach and it can do basic degradation of organic materials, but we would still need some enzymes.
Shizuka: SAUSAGES!
/me hugs Michael back :)
Alchemist: i was referring to a biopolymer plastic that decays into simple sugers
/me hugs Michael back :)
always ready
don't shoot it. you make it poo
:S
/me noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
Alchemist: the acid would digest the cells too
/me noms on thelonepony :3
more sausages!
Jageman: dilute acid then :D
DinkyDoo: http://www.gigapunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/White-Kyurem.jpg This thing
wow
Alchemist: then it would be uneffective
I know who White Kyrume is..
Conveyor belts and organs, the game
That'a hudge bitch.
uhhhh...
:O
Strogg sausages - delicious!
Jageman: I want some acid in the equation goddamit!
Kill it with fire!!!!
man, gabe newell really did let himself go
Cobra!
Fire-dragon type Pokemon, fused with Kyrume, weaknesses are Fire, Dragon, Ground, Rock...
it really hates that box
BOOOX
Alchemist: if you make the scaffold extra sensitive to acids, a very mild one would work
FATTY
How do you guys doing this weird litters ? :C i want to know
Dark_Horst: i knew someone would make that joke :S
so wait you work for COBRA?
loll
what is that thing?
poor Gabe
MOAR GRAVU
*GRAVY
twilight_sprinkle: inevitable B)
play blood
/me noms on Sprunkls :3
Alchemist: besides, nanotech is better than biotech
dat fat giant thing
ohai tehlonpon :3
Alchemist: even though that are similar in some ways
Make it explode!
how youa doin' Sprunkls :3
you*
Feed him moar
oohhhhh that's gross
Ewww
im ok, what about you? how did your birthday go, tehlonpon?
ewwwww

Dat acid
He had one too many hamburgers
*ahem* Cobralalalalalalala!
This game looks... disturbing.....
twilight_sprinkle: Didnt celebrate, but it was nice :3
Would you like this mint, sir? It's wafer thin!
why is this even possible to happen in that factory?
u need play Blood
DinkyDoo: because it is
thelonepony: got any presents?
Jageman: I know..
twilight_sprinkle: Nope
Invi: because of poor planing
it seems so
thelonepony: aww .-. sorry i stole them..
thelonepony: it's your birthday?
;3; give it back sprunkls
and it was yesterday Michael :3
i alrdy sold it ;~;
;^;
soweee..
thelonepony: :(
Invi: you'd think that the super advanced aliens would have though of that.
Michael: Better late then never :$
:3
What is this game even about?
Invi: or whatever they are
Shotting stuff
shoting*
thelonepony: happy birthday :3, sry, didnnt know that

Hi, Sonny. :)
Ohai Sonny :3

ohai Sonny
So yeah that's one of my least favorite levels...
hi thelonepony and Michael ^^
Michael: It's okay :)
bad aliens with weird fetishes
^
/me noms on Sonny :3
weeping_pegasi82: If you're thinking about Quake 4 then yes
thelonepony: what is with you and noms?
I guess Strogg never countd on an enemy getting that deep into the factory and being smart enough to feed the computer commands that would kill the processing creature like that.
Well this level is going to be full of....shit
/me noms on Jageman :3
guys, thelonepony AJIsAwesome Michael I made a new drawing, mind checking it out?
nagger!
Kandarihu: why not, the US government thinks that far ahead.
Sure, Sonny. :)
Got a problem Jageman :3
Okay Sonny :)
Yep that sure is acid
Sonny: show us your creation!
thelonepony: no, just wondering
this is a request from sompony but anyhow

Jageman: i like eating that's all :3
ZOMBIES

weeping_pegasi82: Both. :D
Sonny: dat is good :D

:P
thelonepony: yup ^^
Ded
Cucumber: to bad >:3
Puke zombiiiiies
Sonny Oh so wait you do requests? o.o
thanks Michael ^^
killerpony7733: yes... but... not... now... :p
go eat a boat
That's....a....shame.....
ohhhh twi never lets play this game
Sonny Ah i see. :)
After watching Wreck It Ralph, I have to wonder how much money Disney had to shell out to Nintendo and Sega to use their characters
I'm playing deadspace right now. it's too scary :O why where is no kind ponies? :'(
I've been doing request the past month and I'm kinda feeling isolated to what I can draw ._. killerpony7733
so do the normal zombie rules of getting bitten apply in this game
oh man
Screw it, health pls
SpadeMagnes[School]: you mean they copyrights are still good?
Sonny Yeah i getcha :P
Ded the sequel
damn, i <3 shotguns :)
D:
SpadeMagnes[School]: i though they did that movie because the copyrights ran out
fricken zambies
Sonny But it's always admirable when someone takes on that many requests
Piss off Lanier
Jesus
/me bites on AfricanSpy
cheating detected
killerpony7733: I will probably (in a week or so, be in need of someponies who want to letm me draw stuff c: )
i played dead space with pokerface, maybe i didn't afraid whose types games
I would assume so.... because Sonic is in it, and I will be damned sure they got Smith to do sonic in the movie
and screamers
killerpony7733: just trying to learn ^^ might as well draw what people want/desire c:
Dead Space is literally jump scares the video game
pony_numbers: Dead Space ain't scary :D
Sonny Could i by any chance take a spot when you do?
i do fun with necromorph
hmm good thing i have dead ringer
killerpony7733: maaaabbbyyyy :3
yeup
Sonny Well that would be nice if you could give me a spot when you can ^^
plasma gun?
I'll forget*
I also noticed Sonic actually shows up in the movie but Mario only gets a name mention
Sonny Yes i do :)
Why where are no ponies in the Slender? They might be helpful
killerpony7733: That way I can see who wants me to make him/her a drawing :p
SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe it was too much to have him in the movie
Well they got Bowser,Robotnik,M.Bison,Kano
Sonic...Qbert...
slender annoyed me
SpadeMagnes[School]: but mario and the face of nintendo
...
And that Rhino dude from Altered Beast
Was surprised to see him
SpadeMagnes[School]: like mickey is the face of disney
Also should I feel like a nerd for getting almost all the video game references in the movie?
SpadeMagnes[School]: no, you were just part of the targeted audience
Show them NO friendship! :|
BRUSHYOURTEETH: that's surprisingly obscure
Yes it is
nighty everypony ^^
I had no idea who the guy with the horns was from
well night guys
Bye Invi!
Night, Streetlight. :)
BYe, Invi. :)

Haha, I was just making an Altered Beast reference.
Itaky must be a new country
Hey (put in names I cba to write here) how you all doin?
I know the importance of no spoilers
Ooops
Human-unicorns with horns on the head look strange
BRUSHYOURTEETH: man i love Altered Beast ah memories
/me vigorously shakes Michael and thelonepony 's hands
Anyway...when my family and I were driving back home from our cruise, a cd we got called IMDO(In my disney opinion) this one british guy was abosolutly bashing Mcdonalds

BladedWings: i hate it when that happens

I hate bosses who heal during fights
:O

oh oops sorry misinterpreted the hi SpadeMagnes[School] :D
I hate bosses that revive their minions during the fight Jageman
Ded
Eddmario: ?
What is more annoying? Bosses who heal? or bosses who summon mooks?
Jageman: Woops, that was aimed at SpadeMagnes
Eddmario: I don't have minions
here! Take a medkit!
Eddmario: yet
SpadeMagnes[School]: Bosses who do both?
^
^^
The mooks arent so bad provided I can hit the boss regardless
SpadeMagnes[School]: Real bosses
im training to be an evil scientist, but im having trouble with the evil part

DoctoDoctorWho: what is your goal after take over?
pony_numbers: Have you read the Rules and FAQ? :)
yes yes
lololol
squid lol
prettu sure all keep it here lol
Superrrior intellect
Jageman: My goal is to unite humanity under one rule, then make an interstellar empire
for ponies
floof
lady is calling me back with prices...
DoctoDoctorWho: see, im trying to be evil like that but im too friendly
i would like world domination, just imagine...
In the MLP game is there a faster way to get Gems thats NOT psying for them?
ooh, world domination plan? i have a fewtoo, i even have an idea for a doomsday weapon
DoctoDoctorWho: so i guess ill just be the good guy and stop you
So why does your guy look like some sort of freaky science program?
They said that when you dream you've got to dream big, so I drempt fucking BIG.
Cause he kinda is
Woosh!
Think I will stop here
*evil genius
I remember Evil Genius
whats it about twilight_sprinkle
twilight_sprinkle: whats it like? I already have several under development.
i wish they would make a sequel to evil genius, it was awesome
Thanks for the stream, Shizu. :)
i love the plot of q4
DoctoDoctorWho: Wait, are you an evil genus, or a mad scientist
want world domination? cure cancer
Thanks For the stream Shizuka :)
twilight_sprinkle: doomsday weapons, I mean
alexxm: you have an evil base and you build it how you want, doing objectives and sending minions into other countries
thanks Shizu for the stream :)
that's gonna be expensive
Just to watch episodes?
AJIsAwesome: A bit pre-emptive there :P
yes
And you have to deal with all those annoying agents that try to invade your shit
its going to be awesome.
DoctoDoctorWho: a radiation weapon,using magnetic fields to direct the radiation
MLP_Brovakiin: I know, but she said she'd stop it here.
Jageman: I like to go by "Evil Overlord"
AJIsAwesome: Oh, ok my bad :P
so do you have to become strog or is it optional?
I dont think its going to be too bad.
alexxm: it was a fun game, the style was silly
So much for dazzling
DoctoDoctorWho: im a bit of a mad scientist myself
13hope ponies enjoyed :3
BRUSHYOURTEETH: thats all right, just make the air ducts smaller
Yeah, thank you for the stream Shizuka :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Its so hard to get funding for world domination though.
we Didi :3
thanks for the stream Shizuka
Shizuka: sure :D
thanks Shizuka
did*
nice stream
thanks for stream shizuka
Just you or do you know anyone IRL who likes ponies?
Good stream.
i love it
Jageman: already covered by steps 1-3
DoctoDoctorWho: altho its a bit too cruel of a weapon
nobody remembers Spore?
Thanks Shizu :)
Spore got boring...fast
13spore was awful
and the entire galaxy domination
DoctoDoctorWho: those steps are faulty,
agreed
yeah,
DoctoDoctorWho: or else someone would have taken over by now
twilight_sprinkle: I already have a death ray design that would actually work
Not to mention you activate hard mode when you reach the center of the galaxy
but it was pretty interesting
LOL
/me forever alone
Fucking Grox
just kidding
DoctoDoctorWho: whats the design?
its a meetup.
DoctoDoctorWho: what is your energy source?
haha
cool
haha I can imagine myself
sitting in there alone
DoctoDoctorWho: unless you have a good energy source your design is worthless
lol
well that's what I thought it was XD
You are fucked if you ally with or try to destroy the Grox either way
I was like... that's a little excessive...
I have a projector i could set up at home if i wanted that
Thnks for streaming, Shizuka =3
Must've lagged. O.o
If you ally with the grox every empire in the fucking galaxy hates you and wants you dead
but with more people… need a larger place
depending on how many people show up I want to do text message voting on next episode
would be cool.
twilight_sprinkle: Its basicly a pulse weapon that, upon making contact with the nervous system, tells everything to just stop. Effectively killing the target.
the ironman suit is possible except for the energy source and repulsors
DoctoDoctorWho: and energy pulse?
DoctoDoctorWho: a pulse of what though?
ya
DoctoDoctorWho: if it is an electrical pulse, we have those already
Jageman: working on the same or similar frequancy that the nervous system works on.
Hi everyone.
hey Meanwhile
Naaaaaaaaa
Hi, Meanwhile.
hai Meanwhile
Hi Meanwhile
Meanwhile, with Meanwhile
DoctoDoctorWho: that just sounds like a taser
meanwhile at the hall of justice
Jageman: a really really mean taser, but similar yes.
DoctoDoctorWho: what is the medium that the pulse travels through, air?
The medium is your face.
DoctoDoctorWho: so, its just a lightning cannon?
I have no idea what the topic is, but it's probably your face.
xD
Jageman: well a lightning is ions
You guys overcomplicate it, all you needs a cult. One with plenty of propaganda brainwashing
There's something your face!
Jageman: an em pulse doesnt have to be made of ions i think
who played in 'I have no mouth but i must scream'?
SpadeMagnes[School]: *punch* It was PAIN!
maybe electromagnetic pulse?
just awesome
twilight_sprinkle: an em pulse is useless for killing
twilight_sprinkle: except at levels that are currently unreachabel
mmmmh science talk :$
unreachable*
Jageman: but his idea is to have it interfere with the body em fields, i think, although i dont know much about biology
Doesn't it just make you want to stick your face over a bunsen burner.
Anything at a high enough frequancy could kill us
twilight_sprinkle: your cellphone messes with your em field. your body is uneffected
DoctoDoctorWho: wrong
Jageman: yeah but its a weak em, and it actually can affect your body
Hell, a 22.5 richter earthquake on a planet 10 lightyears away would kill you
DoctoDoctorWho: its not the frequency that kills but the power behind it
/me 11,01washes Bronysith and puts him in Rainbow Dash cosplay
Nittany_Discord: With maid costume or without?
DoctoDoctorWho: also, you can direct lightning with a laser
Jageman: thats what I ment, power/frequancy/wave
yeah i thought about laser too :D
DoctoDoctorWho: those are not the same
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah i think its the amplitude of the wave that does the damage
Np. for plasma, maybe there is way to direct plasma by charged fotons
twilight_sprinkle: no
Jageman: whichever term fits the context I am using is the one I mean
Rocket: Photons?
11,01Vordox: Your choice.
Jageman: why not, bigger amplitude means bigger force of interaction
DoctoDoctorWho: yes :)
Jageman: o wait nvm
Jageman: i forgot energy of a wave is frequency related
So frequency was right from the beginning!
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah but it doesnt have to be at the same frequency of the body
lasers are not very effective in an atmosphere because they lose too much energy into the air
What say you about an orbital-mounted railgun
but that is the reason lasers can redirect lightning
Being sick sucks...
the laser creates a channel of ionized air that is electicaly conductive
DoctoDoctorWho: the government already has dibs on that
Jageman: owaw ive never heard of that, interesting
11,01Being disabled really sucks.
SpadeMagnes[School]: IKR? :(
Jageman: not in space...
DoctoDoctorWho: yes
Jageman: then i m a genius, cause i thought one week about that too :D
There is a treaty that specificly states no weapons in space
DoctoDoctorWho: they are called the rods of god and they were designed in the 80s i think
DoctoDoctorWho: wrong
DoctoDoctorWho: ther is a treaty banning nuclear weapons in space
Nittany_Discord: you are?
DoctoDoctorWho: kinetic weapons are the loophole
DoctoDoctorWho: Secret laser canon on orbit osn't wearpon :)
11,01I won't say positively.
DoctoDoctorWho: your looking it up now, huh.
sanity is for the weak!
Rods of god is simply an automated sattelite chucking I beams at the target. they cannot be aimed and the progect was never fully implemented
DoctoDoctorWho: there have been better designs made since then
Nittany_Discord: i dont qite understand what you mean by positively,vut whatever the case,you are a scientist! and you know your stuff, and thats a rare thing, especially nowadays
A railgun in space however, is much more dangerous
DoctoDoctorWho: that was just the oldest one i could think ove
But anyway, is that possible to conduct plasma with laser ? or accelerated metal pices ?
11,01I'm unemployed. I just have a fancy degree.
damn it rails
Rocket: not really
why don't you know what int is
hi
hai pony_5209
Rocket: but you could use a laser to make plasma
hi /)
Nittany_Discord: give it time and you will. there are always places that could use a could scientist, just need to do some digging
mlp is teh best evar
*will have a job
11,01It's not 100% that I'll even get to have a science or teaching career.
Nittany_Discord: *could use a good scientist
Rocket: I think that is what they are using to kickstart a fusion reactor
Jageman: I wish to see in my life working orbital ion cannon just like in command & conquer 3
hello
hai Rainbow
Rocket: keep dreaming
Nittany_Discord: well its never 100% just because life, but you have a very good chance, since you know your stuffs
Nittany_Discord: Huge cry about teacher wanted
Rocket: ions are a pain to use as a weapon
Teachers doesn't get job
Moment 22
Jageman: yeah, but these reactors are creating energy same to intaked
11,01I know my stuff, but I have very little experience.
working orbital ion cannon not effectively i think
Nittany_Discord: That remidns me ...
Rocket: same to what?
Nittany_Discord: well i personally think theory is more important. you can derive anything you want from the core theory
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #624

pony_numbers: yes
Jageman: to energy that it tahes to run

A railgun fires hyper dense slugs at the target with a STARTING speed of mach 8. It is a barreled weapon that will be capable of surgical precision strikes on a target obliterating almost any defence from above with unforgiving force

Saw that coming.
WELCOME TO THE WORKING MARKET

.
get pooped on bro
.
nopr
Nittany_Discord: yeah but you were a TA once though,that shows you understand things good enough to explain.job experience has to start somewhere
just there is more cheaper and deadlier weapons for now
.
Rocket: meeting the energy requirements and accually using that energy as a weapon are two very different things

Woah long time no see guys
/me hugs lunacorn|devastated
he is gone
:(
today wasnt a good day
:)
:(
>:(
Rocket: does not mean you can just attach it to a laser and start shooting
Jageman: i spelled wrong, >.< i'll try to tell you what do i mean, these reactors in power plant wont do more energy than it takes :D
:O
Nittany_Discord: but i will apply for a few jobs pretty soon. all im saying is dont worry, you have time and thats all you need
what?!
11,01Keep spamming, Rainbow.

Heya scout19_tf2
Its been ages .-.
Hai Meeplord
Hi scout19_tf2 :)
hai scout19_tf2
because rails doesn't make sense.
STF- CUPCAKES!!! :O
Nittany_Discord, still trying to find a job?
lunacorn|devastated: I couldnt find one that said reallly sad
qb Meeplord :)
Nittany_Discord: well one of the jobs should care about that, its just translation to english. the other is tutoring though, and i dont know if i have the right personality
wb*
*shouldnt
DoctoDoctorWho: oh
DoctoDoctorWho: thx anyway...
STF- CUPCAKES!!! :O
is der stream?
lunacorn|devastated: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3puqyan0S1qjvfwoo1_400.png For you.
you should write a php interpriter in rails.
nope
Hello there bronystate. I did not see you there. When I wake up, I like to eat some Wertheres breakfast sausage...
using a high powered laser to redirect lightning as a weapon would be awesome but impractical
that would make sense. :P
0,14Oi, Rainbow, stop spamming, last warning.
Vordox: thanks..
when next stream&
kk
after this class I'm never doing anything with rails again :P
Inb4Rainbowdoesn'tstop
my friend Mike is equally devastated..
11,01CrimsonPhoenix: Not lately.
When the planets align and the eggplants rise to devour us all.
Jageman: But did you see this powerful lasers that are powered up by bouncing from side to side through lens ?
Anyway, hi guys.
11,01Been with the state voc rehab. Doing an eval.
poop
hi BlazeAngel
Right now it's somehow choking on code that it generated itself...
Rocket: that is how most lasers work
hai BlazeAngel
sup BlazeAngel
Rocket: what is your point?
/me shuts up his mouth.
well, this is sad week :(
Hi BlazeAngel :3
lunacorn|devastated: at least you have other friends to support you, right?
:D :O :( :)
thelonepony... You ate it.
Michael: why?
even rails can't code for rails.
I am a goddamn prophet
First Princess_Molestia's passing, and now another person. ><
DoctoDoctorWho: i guess so....
Nooooooo.... >_>
;)
BladedWings: first my aunt, then brony2447
<_<
/me is falling asleep on computer
Vordox are you dead in the cranium?
stahp it Rainbow >:U
Rocket: you still there?
^
Meanwhile: I remember people, that's bad?
>_> ;) :D :O :( :)
stahp it Rainbow >:U
Jageman: Some scientists did that but big for 250 m
Vordox: People who were lying trolls?
Michael: i know.. he was such an amazing person...
Nasal congestion? What's that?
anypony fer some tf2:)
thelonepony: Just let the mods kick/ban him :P
Meanwhile: You mean it was staged by Bronysith ?
scout19_tf2: me plz
Jageman: and then they shoot it into a gold pice
MLP_Brovakiin: okais :3
Rocket: Your point is still unseen.
:P
scout19_tf2: what is your steam? i need to vent
Rainbow: bye bye
Vordox: Naw, I mean it was staged by the person in question.
Vordox: what?
Meanwhile: But Bronysith was the messenger.
Bye guys, I gotta go to bed. Night!
Goodnight MadSurge :)
bye MadSurge
/me is leaving for sleep waves everyone goodbye
night MadSurge
Meanwhile: Vordox say what?
Bye MadSurge :)
Vordox: Mm, but he's not the one who started it.
/me shows his condolences to lunacorn|devastated
>_> ;) :D :O :( :)
Bronysith: Your ex who was dead but not really and not even a lass.
Michael: thx...
>:I
Rainbow: You're.... at the edge
Jageman: My point is, if technology will went forward, they could do a wearpon of it
lunacorn|devastated: wuts vent
Meanwhile: Well I did not know that.
nope.avi
Meanwhile: lets not get into that again XD
scout19_tf2: get rid of my anger on video games
Vordox: You learned something today.
Vordox: push Rainbow from the edge >:I
scout19_tf2: my friend died last night
Rocket: there are already weaponized lasers
Rainbow: Keep on pratting around and you will have the boot to deal with :D
>_> ;) :D :O :( :)
More then the boot, even the key for the lock
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah
MLP_Brovakiin: a Boot to the head you mean :P
lunacorn|devastated: dude im so sorry
Jageman: i know but i mean big orbite laser :)
Rocket: they are just less effective than bullets
scout19_tf2: thx....
:'(
well thats good then
DoctoDoctorWho: yeah..
flash crashed :|
Rocket: they would not work
Jageman: why ?
thelonepony: Maybe Saxy's boot, to the face :D
Michael: happens to me alot :D
:P >_> ;) :D :O :( :) :|
so i heard there was some direct to dvd mlp thing coming out
Rocket: the atmosphere would obsorb the energy before it hit the ground
>Didn't want to talk about it
HOLY shit!?!?!!?
>Spend like ten minutes talking about it.
MLP_Brovakiin: I seen The Bustah wolf boot but not that boot :D
People these days.
I LIKE this fanon! http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/35544198534 Sombra is the ONLY one able to repel Molestia!
thelonepony: XD
Jageman: even at low high?
Rocket: low high?
i learned that no matter what hoof to use to rub the horn
lawl
lunacorn|devastated: so ur server or mine
Sombra is such a waste of animation
MLP_Brovakiin: i said, "Come at me bra" at Saxy and he Boot me with that one :D
Rocket: do you mean low orbit?
Jageman: Small high * sorry i m sleeping
BRUSHYOURTEETH: Sombra is the secont most powerful entity so far
^
thelonepony: hehe :D
Jageman: yes low orbit
And yet has less combined total screen time than any one shot character in the show
Rocket: :P >_> ;) :D :O :( :) :| :P >_> ;) :D :O :( :) :| :P >_> ;) :D :O :( :) :|
>:I
Vordox whos the first discord?
scout19_tf2: yours
Inb4 kick for emote spam
/me grabs the shotgun >:I
really
BRUSHYOURTEETH: alexxm Yep
Rocket: any orbit would be too far away
PUT ME IN COACH
thats getting slightly annoing
Vordox: discord is effectivly omnipotent so, yeah
PUT ME IN
Rainbow: Aaand that's the line, good bye
scout19_tf2: actually damn steam crashed, but my other friend needs to vent too
........
Rocket: unless you use a metric crap ton of enerfy
Vordox i'd probably put put sombra after the alicorns though
someone stream dark souls!
or xcom
anyway im going to mourn
gtg
alexxm: Princess Cadance < Sombra
Rocket: energy*
Or Strawberry Shortcake.
Bye, lunacorn|devastated. :)
Mike will be on too
Bye lunacorn|devastated, hope you feel better
Vordox most of the alicorns then
when you see him say hi
alexxm: Shadow vs Night = Shadow wins
lunacorn|devastated: bye, hope things goes well to you :)
alexxm: Light vs Shadow = Equal
Oh good the stupid allegations with Kevin Clash were recanted
Rocket: it would be more efficient to just drop a big rock from the same hight
Jageman: hmm.. but how about plasma cannon, m field gaves shape to plasma, is there way to make tunnel of m field?
lunacorn|devastated: wait 1 sec
bye lunacorn|devastated
princesse missile cadance
/me hugs lunacorn|devastated bye get better friend :)
huh ok then Vordox
J_E_Smith71: So he has role as Elmo back?
Justice is served
* has his
lunacorn|devastated: tell him to go to LEGION OF PONIES | ALMOST 24/7
alexxm: Yes, without light there's no shadow, without no shadow there is no light
alexxm: Typical Jin Jang
Saxy has asked you about your well being
there is no return
hey guys
So tehrefore, only one able to beat Sombra, would be Discord.
Heya MusicMikeTheMic :)
0,14heck, i din't even ask about the wellbeing
Rocket: same problem, the air would absorb the heat from the plasma and cool it down to ineffective temperatures
Hi MusicMikeTheMic :)
Breaker Tiger.
ohai MusicMikeTheMic
SaxyPretender: it was implied
thelonepony: was lunacorn on? i hope i didnt miss him
AJIsAwesome: They haven't said, but Seasame Workshop did mention “We are pleased that this matter has been brought to a close, and we are happy that Kevin can move on from this unfortunate episode.”
MusicMikeTheMic: you did....
Rocket: believe me, if it was possible, we would have them
Okay. Thanks, J_E_Smith71. :)
SaxyPretender, Are you tired of nasal congestion?!
thelonepony: damnit...
/me puts on thinking hat
something feels odd
apparently it was supposed to be integer instead of int
something isnt right :I
sombra just stay near episode and jelly it
Jelly what?
I still blame rails for having too many conventions
aww rocket left
you know
:( sometimes it feels like theres never any stream:(
unspeakable jelly
I'm still waiting for when Sombra wrecks up Equestria
___ it
rails is too bitchy.
who will i talk tech with now
it needs to relax like php.
pony_numbers: you mean jelliton :3
Jageman: Im still here
DoctoDoctorWho: oh ya
DoctoDoctorWho: did you see our discustion?
also i want Larson as plotmaker for next episodes
it's all about time best for me
Jageman: I like you, did I ever tell you my designs for the indestructable 30 foot death robot?
DoctoDoctorWho: no
:o
DoctoDoctorWho: i hope you have a good power source
Rails is like "Oh you didn't name your objects exactly what I expected; I'd better bitch about it"
:( this harmonica tune always cheers me up when im sad,Katsumi Daido aka Eternal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-r9g_-5huM hope it'll help :)
Sketch_Toku_Brony: lunacorn left :(
i know i just needed to here this
DoctoDoctorWho: giant robots are possibe today in all areas except the power ource
Indestructable isnt correct tho, physics says anything can be destroyed if you hit it hard enough.
oh lawl
*hear
DoctoDoctorWho: true
lol brony world
php is like "Yeah, do whatever you want" and you end up with impossible to understand code
hello*
DoctoDoctorWho: exept black holes, they just merge
Lets just say invulnerable to all current human weapons
ohai haseo348
DoctoDoctorWho: i find that hard to believe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m8WFobFRQo
no stream yet?
No stream
11,01It doesn't really get "destroyed." Just transforme.
haseo348: nope
11,01*transformed
DoctoDoctorWho: what is your defence against projected electron weapons?
Jageman: youd be surprised, the armor is very complex
but we do have the buffer show on :3
anyone on steam? i need to let out my anger on video games..
aw..i came home from school expecting to see somtething..
DoctoDoctorWho: the armor is not the problem, its the electronics inside
Mods will stream when they want to. Please be patient. :)
your computer is more sentitive the radiation then you are
Anyone here have a good Ear for music?
gak
AJIsAwesome: No >:3
LOL
you get out what you put in for php
if you spend time to format your code
jelly
word still banned?
and not make it messy
Anyone? =<
Yep.
you get decent code.
the armor is coated in an experimental plastic compound that is immune to all heat based weapons, it has EMP and radiation countermeasures under the conventional armor
Vordox: i wish i did :D really wanna play this song on a harmonica http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-r9g_-5huM
Hi everypony!
Hai Dink
Hi, DinkyDoo. :)
DoctoDoctorWho: theoritical?
hai DinkyDoo
Hi DinkyDoo :)
I belive its copper plating that stops EMPs?
DoctoDoctorWho: btw, nothing is immune to heat
Hai again DinkyDoo :)
o lookie who here dinkydoo
Hello everypony that said hi to me c:
Jageman: The sun?
how are things DinkyDoo
hello!
delicious bags
DoctoDoctorWho: only if it has no holes in the plating
Alexxm: Good, I guess.
gàk
yeah

Hi Jageman!
oh u :3
DinkyDoo: hi
guk?
MLP_Brovakiin: no not even the sun
:I
MLP_Brovakiin: if the sun was superheated, it woudl super nova
my teacher that's making us use rails basically said php gives you too much freedom to screw up
good :3
thelonepony do :S face it's adorable
AJIsAwesome, dat me
So it all makes sense why he likes rails...
The sun'll supernova on it's own eventually anyways. Speed it up if you can.
pony_numbers: No :3
I'm gonna scare myself by listening to Sweetie Derell going ''AAAAAAA'' again xD.
Meanwhile: wrong
Meanwhile: it does not have enough fuel
lol
c/++ will let you screw up too.
Meanwhile: it is not massive enough
asm will let you screw up
Not like my dick.
DinkyDoo don't do it you'll go insane
computers only do what they are told.
and java
He wouldn't shut up about Java
Alexxm: I will...?
lolololol
until he found out about rails
Meanwhile: stars that supernova are huge and relatively short lasting
lol
...
Those who can't do, teach.
/me QUICKLY REMOVES HISTORY
he was in the industry for like 10 years
Meanwhile: burning off in less than a billion years or so
that's what I don't get
/me Removes history in five seconds
I think he switched to teaching so his son could get free tuition
Sweetie Derelle haunts me..
Gnight everypony :)
I still hear her going '''AAAAAAAAA''
companies don't hire older programmers either.
can some one explain how far ahead or how far behind est time is for a californien pony?
why does everyone i talk tech to leave me? :(
if hes older thats another reason.
I have no idea how he even got hired; he's extremely weird
Bye, Michael. :)
Night Michael :)
He's like 50 I think, so maybe
you gotta be a little bit of a nut to program well.
Michael: bye
Goodnight Michael :)
haha
true
its no fun otherwise.
:P
haseo348: 84342 million years

Hello everypony!
Heya Derpy101 :)
Hi Derpy101 L)
hmm

jageman: not sure...thats why im asking everypony here..
Hi, Derpy101. :)
try dying your hair a bunch of colours
sometimes that helps.
jageman: i dont wanna be late for movie night..
:)
or new episodes for that mater..
haseo348: is the timer set for est?
haseo348: i think est is three hours ahead of pst ^_^
haseo348: and does that matter?
lol
heres some Game Grumps Sonic '06 to keep ya busy :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdeLpndCux8
haseo348: when i joined for the premier it counted down just fine for me
Sketch_Toku_Brony, aw shit
BladedWings: i hope so...
haseo348: and im in az
Sketch_Toku_Brony, IT'S NO USE
Eh I like the Brainscratch version of 06 more...more for the fact of Sonic getting sent to the moon
CrimsonPhoenix: :D ikr
IT'S NO USE!
And table rape
jageman: i see the timer for friday movie night
rainbow dash hair
LETS SPEED UP
perfect
SpadeMagnes[School]: I like both. Especially because of that. And TO THE MOON!!!!
jageman: but i get home like at 4:40...
rainbow dash hair is so overdone.
:P
haseo348: the timer worked for me last time
people would probably just assume i'm a lesbian or something
I really dont know why but the animated sprite for White Kyurem looks less animated than Black Kyurem
I think people assume im gay when i wear my rainbow dash hat.
haseo348: i think the timer is works no matter what time zone you are in
jageman: wait are we talking about the same timer here?
*the Silver fight*
hahaha
haseo348: it happens every week
Fuck that fucking useless character, of all the terrible things Sonic '06' did, he was...one of them.
I heard people at work talking about bronies today
jageman: because i have no idea what your talking about...we are talking about the movie night timer right?...
You want to know something funny?
You know
haseo348: ya
You know how silver is so slow?
Manager says to my coworker "Have you ever heard of bronies?"
I feel bad for Blaze in 06
Wasn't he supposed to have an upgrade to make him faster?
"No, what's that?"
A dummied out power up was supposed to speed him up
I think a lot of programmers are.
"It's people who watch my little pony"
since 06 just wrecked everything that was built with Blaze in Sonic Rush
Pfffthaha
still no stream:S
jageman: oh i think i get you...
"haha, like a club or something?"
But they forgot to put it in the game. :S
haseo348: the time between now and the movie night is not relative to your local time
Blaze played well in 06
Yeah Blaze got a raw deal
jageman: ohh ok i got it.
You know what else they forgot to program into 06?
Sonic's gem meter being able to drain
SpadeMagnes[School], I know thats why I feel bad for her
Especially since she shows up with goddamn Silver a lot
SpadeMagnes[School]: a good game?
Hello Everypony!
Hi, Frosted. :)
Hi Frosted!
And I'm just standing there like "You _just_ found out about bronies??"
It even says in the fucking MANUAL that sonic's meter will drain
:)
SpadeMagnes[School], since it's implying that she comes from the future and not another dimension
They dont even fucking proof read the manuals
/me rips off shirt to reveal giant MLP tattoo on back
Hi Frosted :)
SpadeMagnes[School]: they forgot to program a good game?
that would be so funny.
hahaha
and I have to be honest with you guys
as much cliche as Blaze was
I love her
?
In my case I would probably get fired... :P
Blaze is one of the few good sonic characters
The defining moment of Sonic '06 is when you can just walk past the loops. Literally walk the loops.
Hello humans.
God I hate 06 Omega
http://www.dorkly.com/video/5464/sonic-takes-a-stroll
jageman: so it would start at 4:00 pm for me then...
Who is this Omega you speak of?
Nothing is streaming? Aww.
There is only Gamma.
E-123 Omega
NOPE
haseo348: it starts in 3days and 22minutes for everyone
You do know Gamma is dead, right?
His hover is so broken you can glitch to parts of wave ocean he isnt supposed to get into
I can't hear youuuu
Wait, wasn't he brought back in Battle?
made me lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM very relevent
*Gives Everypony a muffin*
oh yeah I've see that, haha
Theres this one line in shadow's story that is so bad
XD
*Eats muffin* Thanks Derpy101 :)
CrimsonPhoenix: mine is funnier
Yes I know that Omega is a different character, the point is that he's so awful compared to Gamma it crosses over into hilarity
A gun agent tells Shadow to proceed to wave ocean and then the line repeats...again
Hello, sir.
Jageman, but it doesn't include a lot of glitches
only one
*tipsNonExistentHat*
CrimsonPhoenix: but it shows the dumbest one
Anyone remember when Shadow used to be fast?
I do.
CrimsonPhoenix: besides dorkly is funny
Jageman, I know but there are still alot of others glitches to know
Not all Dorkly is funny, IMO.
And Sonic Man is a joke if SILVER,FUCKING SILVER can out run him
AJIsAwesome: i know, but most is funny
:D oh god Game Grumps fighting Silver rofl
SpadeMagnes[School]: I know, right? :D
Shadow's story was the only competent one of the bunch
And I'm back o:
wb Arcane :)
how've you been Arcane
The Silver fight is arguably one of the worst things in video games.
hello everypony! what are we talking about?
Someone programmed it and thought it was a good idea.
Ive been enjoying this documentary http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UneYciGf84I&feature=related
ty thelonepony How is everypony?
God help you if you get stuck between him and a wall
You keep picking up a ring and cant die
/me noms on Arcane :3
Hi, FluffyFluttershy and welcome back, Arcane. :)
IT'S NO USE!
*wall slam*
IT'S NO USE!
thelonepony Not the mane, D:
:3
Hello FluffyFluttershy
Also Silver is a beginners trap
You would assume you can just homing attack him and be done with it
lol Legend of Greg :D
Hi FluffyFluttershy;)
Heay FluffyFluttershy :)
how are things FluffyFluttershy
:)
Good
SpadeMagnes[School], it's not really hard to figure it out really
Hi FluffyFluttershy :)
I find it hilarious Silver is harder than the Sonic fight..Sonic fight is a joke
Hi everypony ^-^
Gambling?
Hello FluffyFluttershy
SpadeMagnes[School]: ikr :D
yeah
So were talking about Sonic?
Also Shadow/Sonic fight in Sonic Adventure 2 you had to homing attack at the back
those people are nutcases.
I don't ever want to gamble.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrMk-JW_IUQ
We're talking about a terrible Sonic character and how awful it is to fight him.
Behold!
Oh Okay then
Im a logical thinker
at least I like to think I am.
and gambling doesn't make sense.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Until you learn what to do, then you just wait for him to go "How bout this?" then run him and slide kick him
now theyre ranting on about Silver's chest and how he chews on it like someone does w/ a pen or hair at Driver's ED all like "...huh wha?" :D
SpadeMagnes[School]: Then he's easy
Heheh
night guys
The fact sonic gets absolutly destroyed with a barrage of tables is hilarious
Night alexxm :)
It's funny when you're desperately spamming Homing ATtack to try and get away from him, and you keep running into his ass until he gets up. GAMEPLAY
I just changed something in a view and didn't get any errors!
Night, alexxm. :)
:D
amazing
I hated the voice for Omega in 06
lol
Hi
I got some new headphones today
they seem to be good.
No stream again..
I have a crease on my hair
where the band goes around
lol
lol, do you ever take them off?
you got to wait :I
^
Im the new iPhone6s , now 20 inches bigger than past generations.
Mods will stream when they want to. Please be patient. :)
no
Streams don't exist, streams're a myth.
lol
Iphone6s: mobile techologies suck
and cuz, mods do have lives you know
they are noise cancelling
and theres a lot of noise around.
Like Bigfoot. Or free wi-fi.
I just use those little earbuds and have to keep putting them in when I run
Tutle Beach?
so I wouldnt want to take them off
SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah 4Kids had a good voice for Omega in Shadow then they give him the crappy robot voice in 06
then I would have to listen to customers.

hi all!
In fact screw my politics too.
If all Mephilis had to do was to make Elise cry to fuse with Iblis why didnt he just do it himself?
Derpy 2016. She promised us muffins.
SuperBrony64: President Wiiu :3
SpadeMagnes[School]: That's what you get when you rush your game to get in stores and don't finish it and don't play test it right
I can understand SimGretina a bit
I only have Sony stuio headphones, cna't run in those.
I used to think wearing big headphones was stupid
but I dont care anymore.
Screw politics in general. If I wanted to be depressed about the state of the world I'd read a year 9 science paper.
I like these ones because apparently they are supposed to be reference headphones
what game J_E_Smith71 ?
Screw celestia
Kura: Sonic '06
and not shitty headphones that mutiliate and rape your audio like beats or something.
see?
oh really?
These ones.
but now I kinda think of him has the dance genre artist
sonic '06 sucked..
I forget how it is.
It's true some days are dark and lonely...
Hey RDX.
another myth is not landing on the moon
Shadow the hedgeogh sucked
Hello
sonic heros was ok...
yo
Seriously
Iphone6s: It was better than Sonic '06 though
because if it was fake, we would have 1uped it by now
Shadow The Hedgehog was meh to me.
I just don't have the money to go buying fancy headphones.
Shadow the Hedgehog was hilarious for how backwards it was. You know what a Sonic game needs? GUNZ AND MOTORBIKES
AJIsAwesome: Hey it was better that Sonic 06 at least
LOL
just get like every SimGretina's soundtrack and you have enough tunes to last a clube for weekse
never played any new Sonic games tbh
weeks**
J_E_Smith71: Agreed.
AJIsAwesome: I like what shadow could have been but was not
I never*
Never gonna give you up
Play lovepotiondisaster there is no shadow
i didnt get sonic unleashed...it seemed boring to me...
My next big purchase will probably be a new, non-HP laptop
i played it but...i didnt feel right...
I liked Sonic Unleashed. The Werehog could've been better.
so might as wellput some money into it
They were going to have Knuckles as the Werehog, but they cancelled the idea due to time constraints.
My car is my boombox. XD For non-boomy music.
*instead of the Werehog
would of fit knuckles Persona
You know what would've been interesting?
what?
:3
if tails turned to a werewolf?
Your sonic and mario are foolish only Turok have a sense <_<
AJIsAwesome: Knuckles in beat em up gameplay would have been better. I've always thought that
If they hadn't used the term "werehog" because it doesn't make sense?
If Knuckles would've been in the game replacing the Werehog, that game could've been considered a SA3.
SA3 they're saving that for dreamcast 2
i hope...
AJIsAwesome: Well it was called Sonic World Adventure in Japan actually
A new laptop that won't fall apart :(
J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah, I forgot that.
Sonic Rainboow rules the equstria
Oh. Like those bullet-proof military laptops.
despite the case being broken it still functions perfectly well though, so I'm not going to buy one for a while
Pleeeease let there be ponies in the next SSBB? c:
does anybody else think sega might get back into the home console bussiness again>
???
SSBB?
I'd want Sega to get back into that race again.
How did it break?
0,14>saw a capitalised Persona
I was on Team Sega back then.
0,14>thought discussing of Persona 4 Arena
:D
It's a defect with the model I got
0,14sadly this is not the case ;_;
It's gonna be sad when youth don't know the awesome of super smash brothers brawl. :<
i do also but someone currently in the race would have to drop out...
sega, nintendo, xbox... only pc have a sense
Saxy is disappoint.
The left hinge always breaks
sorry SaxyPretender :D
now Bustah wolf >:3
plus I carry it around with me all the time... so it probably got a little beat up from that too
Simple enough, Sony's on the verge on dropping out anyway due to horrible decisions
/me recoils, goes brush his teeth D:
XD
ok mods im going to ask this. can we have a vote real quick?
I liked Brawl, but I prefer Melee.
Okay okay, I'm going!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZVwJfkM0Eg
I should take a picture
Duct tape. Magenta tiger stripe duct tape.http://www.hooptapecanada.com/bmz_cache/f/f5308cdd2d635f051f94fd2d4f873001.image.350x207.JPG
The left corner is held together by tape
Do svidan'ya don't get any on ya
Sega has a lot of neat properties that aren't just Sonic
/me bets we have only monolingual mods. :/
But they tend to forget about them
who would you like to see get dropped out of the home console race if sega ever got back in the race? micrsoft, nintendo or sony?
0,14like anything Platinum Games makes
haha, I got shiny silver duct tape hoping it would match, but it didn't
i say sony
0,14Sega's on my hate list for mucking up Bayonetta 2 and Anarchy Reigns
so it's just this ugly black tape
:D
Oh jesus....
I want Turbo Grafx 16 back!
LOL nec makes projectors now...
for not releasing Bayonetta 2 for the other consoles, SaxyPretender?
I KNOW U SHULD GET THE IPAD MINI
Sega stabbed me in the back by not localizing Valkyria Chronicles 3, pretty much
0,14well, not quite
LOL
oh
I have three testicles
Yeah that'll totally replace a laptop
thelonepony: They cancelled the idea/development of Baynoetta 2.
0,14for not having enough faith in Pla-
o______o
You do fucking relize that there would have been no Bayonetta 2 period if Sega didnt pick it up right
AJIsAwesome .......
>:I
sega stabbed me back when they released sonic '06
...
Uh, mer?
I added this Celica to my mod this week: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3607/3396928954_748a931f79.jpg
No matter what the issue
Ups , my bad :P
Sega *didn't* pick up Bayonetta 2.
0,14but yeah, it looks like Sega's been losing faith in Plat's stuff
Nintendo is footing the bill.
nooo
0,14which is why Nintendo is making it
Bayonetta Shmayonetta
Which is why it's Wii U exclusive.
o wait nvm...
Well be glad your getting it at all
Bayonetta is so overrated
no call of duty is
^
And twilight
Sega could easily improve if they focused on their other franchises again
mw 3 and black ops...
Call of Duty is INCREDIBLY overrated.
And black ops 2 soon
I love Sonic and all but goddamn
BRUSHYOURTEETH: Agreed.
haseo348: Mw 1 was nive
Only earth 2150 have a sense
I wanna see a MechWarrior stream here someday. ;.;

Bitch please , tetris is better

no, pong!
Unlike nintendo Sega doesnt have shitloads of characters to make games for

Its a trap.
ALL your games are overrated, I go to my job! >:C

You guys would not know how disorienting being on a ship is
NEVER? THERES NO WAY THAT CAN BE RIGHT!!!
Having been on a ship I'm inclined to disagree.
I kept rocking back and forth sometimes
"halt ur actions! my timepiece suggests a necessity for mallets!"
Hah my plan to trap sonic has worked perfectly!

Spoilers: Master Chief is in Halo 4
I found a whole thread where people photoshop pics of ponies into their homes and stuff
lies
:>
its pretty bad.
Arbiter is :U
Bigger Spoilers: you play as a random marine though
We_got_the_wub_wub: quit with the joke spoilers the campaign is the only reason i like the game
Not as bad as the thread I saw where people were trying to make split personalities so that they could fuck them.
Oh for crying out loud
And we wonder how social networking sites are ruining our social lives.
thanks for ruining Halo for me.
lol
XD
I'm being srs
^
:I
D:
doosh pls
I dunno, because they have no contact with real people probably
seriously, all multiplayer has are whining little 7 year old brats
thread titled "guide to keeping your pony sex slave"
where do you people go on the internet to see this stuff? o.O
the campaign is the only thing i like
Derpy_Hooves Strange, all I usually find was mature people.
same
Halo revolutionized console FPSs, and then promptly ruined it with the very next game.

At least the kids will be on CoD BO2 now
Well, I found that thread the one time I looked on /mlp/

I don't even have that MadSurge.
Gold_Demona: wait for your Mac to be fixed

MadSurge, I still couldn't play it.

Gold_Demona: make a comic when your Mac comes back :)
I think I might. XD
My PC's still lonely, and my husband's PC still thinks my PC is dumb and crazy. :P

"Artist computers! Yeesh!"
Is your hubby's PC clean and neat?
Define clean and neat :D
Gold_Demona: organized

Hiyo Dken2021
im kinda hoping in the future there would be a better way to get gems
I just slam everything into one folder, have only recently started to make separate folders for games and everything else
Squallken, From what I've seen of it, it functions like a typical facebook game (which I'm surprised they haven't made it into) so probably not.
ah ok
You either have to wait patiently to get them or pay money for them
im going to see how long I can go without paying
heh
so far im okay
only need 10 more crystal hearts :D
till i get Scootaloo :D

ive actually never been a fan of that song, never understood why its a fad
altho its not the song itself, its that HeMan video
I liked it when I was a kid, still like it
ooh- damn internet
youve not seen that video?
of course not, I generally never see internet things
like- never seen FiW- Anthology- barely seen .mov- never saw rick roll, saw trololo song once before it became troll song
its always in the suggestions on youtube
depends on what you watch
no, its Always there
no, it depends on what you watch
not in suggestions, mayb in sponsored
o wait no
i mrean related vids
youtube mixes everything in the same place, but i mean its always in related
mine has Recommended, casiokids, banjo kazooie- opera- some lets plays
not to me, it really depends on your watch-history and what you're currently watching
I've never heard of the heman video before- but I noticed suddenly everyone singing that song
Good afternoon everyone :)
related depends on what youre atching atm
yeah
and it always pops up in related for me
hoi MLP_Brovakiin
well not always but way too often, even when its not related at all
hi MLP_Brovakiin
anyway here it is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4
Hehe, sick-
i dont understand why people like it so much
/me hesitantly clicks
fup- wrong browser,
Vivix: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/68dd66ae91c16f2a4bef2e1de49fc394.gif and Sombra joins the fray! :D
oh god..
/me shudders at video
Fray?
yeah idk why the heeyeahyeah video is so popular
Vivix: try to listen to the original song, it's better :D
yeah I like the original
reminds me of my childhood
also Vivix http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
i actually like that song :3
AttackWithHugs: where you been?
/me huggles Jmo, Kammerjunk, and twilight_sprinkle
MadSurge, I went back to sleep cause I woke up at like 7 this morning
AttackWithHugs: awww
Yep
Why does it seem like most people are nervous about talking to a crowd?
'Cuz they are, I suppose
heya AttackWithHugs :)
Well, that's a darn shame. It's fun!
hey guys
Heya alexxm :)
Oh hi, alexxm.
that's a PAT, most peple get NAT about it
Hiya MLP_Brovakiin

Kammerjunk: its because of fear of judgement
hoi alexxm
It's the Bronystate Kidnapper, ruuun! *hides*

Heya Lil_B :)

hrm
hoi Lil_B
Fine, alexxm. Just woke up for the second time this morning.
thanks Vivix AttackWithHugs MLP_Brovakiin alexxm and twilight_sprinkle :)
AttackWithHugs: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/4bc536d66dab6c2f779e71da85222533.png good morning! :)
good morning morning AttackWithHugs!
Hello Lil_B :) who's your fav pony again?
hi alexxm!
MadSurge Rarity :)
sup Dark92Enigma
good morning AttackWithHugs *hugs*
MadSurge: :D
Night, BladedWings.
AttackWithHugs: oh you~ *ruffles your hair* ^_^
Lil_B: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/fc84b0f1dc170f4d2345b01459a72717.png she made it work, but still! :D
Indie Music Bundle 4 \m/
/me gives BladedWings some macaroni and cheese
MadSurge magnificent, just gorgous :)
/me places a blue eyes white dragon plushie on AttackWithHugs head :3
Yaay
finally found out how to make some nice rich sounds in LMMS.... now I only need to get better in making appealin melodys
YES! new Nintendo Direct Video :)
what did you do Lil_B?
Vivix play around with effects, I still don't understand much technical wise
Ah hehe
I recently bought a new mic and soundcard- so now I can stereorecord my amp, for that The Cure sound
/me places a Dark Magician Girl plushie on the Blue Eyed White dragon plushie on AttackWithHugs's head.
/me Wonders why there isn't an ''Excuse me princess'' t-shirt
Wooo \:o/
lol VenHur
Vivix maybe you and Invi|nap can make a Bass Battle some time :P
hehe yeah
and finally got some decent Guitar sounds out of it, wanted to get these sounds for quite a while xD
Ah, nice
... man, NintendoGermany just posted a bunch of the german WiiU TV spots... they are horrible :/
Lil_B how bad
alexxm same as other WiiU spots, but with horrible Dubbing, no feeling, poor choice of words, and it doesn't remotly sound like these words are coming from these persons
man, and people still thank that MLP got a bad Dub here xD
hehe
Lil_B: I heard that the Twilight VA is pretty good :D
MadSurge yeah, they are allk good VAs, the only thing that is bad somtimes in the german dub is the choice of words and sometimes the emphesising (like they just got the plain text, without notices like "serkastic" or something like that)
other than that, lots of Fans here just complain about that they "don't sound like the Character". to which I can just say, they do sound like the Character, they just don't sound like the original VA
08,01Lil_B: you just wait until the german dub of s2 comes out
08,01apparently, there's a galacon easter egg
Lil_B: Italian dubbers seem to have gotten the sarcasm :D I like Twilight, Applejack/Fluttershy and Pinkie can rage pretty well :D RD is meh, and Rarity is the worst of the bunch, although the VA seems to have taken ham lessons for the second season XD
^same
Why is it so bloody expensive to go to a good ballet? *pout*
MadSurge yeah, but I basicly hate all people which arguments can be summed up as "is not like the original"
Lil_B: same
Discord got a nice VA here, he does a good job, but unfourtunatly, he doesn't sound "old" enough, if you know what I mean xD they should have removed Discords Beard for that xD
Twilight sounds nothing like Tara's performance, but she captures pretty well the spirit :D
08,01Lil_B: ...
08,01Hasbro Europe why dost thou suck?!
Lil_B: you don't diss german Data
08,01hullo x1es!
MadSurge he does so much more, like Patty the priate from Spongebob Sqarepants xD
:D
08,01x1es: My Alcoholic Friends
08,01wait, no, that's Dresden Dolls...
Hey everyone! :)
Oh you.
Hey SafariMonkey-.
08,01x1es: Smile Song
how are things SafariMonkey
08,01oh cool, i just found 10 boxes of tramadol
08,0128 tablet per box

Sweet.
MadSurge btw, whats BBBFF in Italian? here it is GBUBF :)
I only have 1x tram left, booo.
ghost SafariMonkey ghotifish

Lil_B: I refuse to listen to any songs :D
;/
MadSurge xD
hey SafariMonkey :)
what are we suppose to do?
SafariMonkey-: Ohdear. ;)
yep x1es
/me now watches german Luna eclipsed

The pony alarm goes off everytime some one says the "pony of the day" name

Huh. "He's not a registered sex offender. He pled guilty to misdemeanor obscenity, and that was it. He could have been﻿ prosecuted by two separate jurisdictions: one decided not to pursue it at all, because the evidence was so weak; the other waited until the last possible day to file charges. And they took a reduced plea. My guess: some young prosecutor punk wanted a celebrity scalp on his or her wall, and knew Paul wouldn't want a tri

wuzzup you ponies?
wuzzup Eli!
Heya Eli :)
Deacon: boredom is up! and with you?
how are things Eli
hi Eli
alexxm: getting squished to death by schoolwork, otherwise fine. you?
Eli cold
I've never read a trixie fanfic
i've been better Eli
DaringDerpy: you should. most of them are fun
twilight obsessed trixie sounds a bit nsfw...not sure if I want this
DaringDerpy: love the Twixie. can't wait for Trixie's return in S3 :$
:)
DaringDerpy: what story are you considering to read? if it's on fimfiction.net i have most likely read it and could recomend it... or not
I have no idea
haven't read more than 10 or 20 fanfics at all
c'mon, you gotta admit this is cute http://www.derpibooru.org/30578
don't really know the scene
youtube poop:) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqLt1fHwbCY&feature=plcp
cute and...a bit sappy... :(
DaringDerpy: if it contains romance and no humans i have probably read it at some point. i have around 500 stories on my phone...
ok so i was reading some stuff on PonyChat and thats alot of information in there holy crap
oh wow
Deacon: the story this most likely refers to is Doll. check it out
god damn it i'm a nerd
oh, never knew it was based on a fic
I finished fallout equestria yesterday...ok for a fanfic, I think. but nothing extraordinary
Eli: anything really awesome you could suggest?
DaringDerpy: dawn fade's university nights.
Oh crap i didn't mean to do that my mistake on that
DaringDerpy: i love that story. Stories with background ponies usually are better written than with the mane six. because their personality aren't defined in the show, and the author has more creative space.
adult content...
they are still serving watered down Manhattans?
:)
HOW ABOUT THIS? http://www.fimfiction.net/story/44792/Damn-it%2C-Twilight%2C-I-love-you%21
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animation: My Little Pony: Dota 2
Eli: true...same here
Eli: thx, I will read it
many who write with the mane 6 fuck up their personality some way
added "sunshine" to my reading list as well
DaringDerpy: ... sorry "university days"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
erm...
its not bad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95_1fPf2dhs&feature=related
DaringDerpy: nights is just the side story for the "adult" stuff. but seriously, even that isn't clop. that's just finer romance
DaringDerpy: i'm not really into clop myself
there is a difference between clop and romance
yea, I've read both
I find it slightly disturbing...cartoon ponies
but...who am I to judge ^^
DaringDerpy: yeah, but just read university days. and then check out nights maybe. if you can "clop" to that you deserv an award
'sup guys
sounds like a challenge :P
hi Chrysalis
being a brony means you have an open mind :)
Heya Chrysalis :)
or at leasat more open after you have read some of the stories :p
how've you been Chrysalis
DaringDerpy: don't take it as one. I don't really like clop, but sex is a major part of life. and i don't have anything against it in a good story
o/ Chrysalis
pretty good
:)
okay here is a goodnot clop romance fic http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19077/Curse-of-The-Werepony
hey guys can all of you crack your hoofs its just like cracking your fist like your knuckles
how can youz crack your hoof?
crack....hoves?
yeah
well, sunshine is .. kinda romancy, kinda actiony :)
Ryunosuke: I remember the twilight blimple reading on youtube...I think I've seen it all ^^
i do it sometimes
"Sunny skies all day long" is also a good one. it's really short but sweet. no romance. for those who don't like shipping or long reads
Greetings BronyState!
too much at once
greeting Socks
DaringDerpy: brain overload?
tbh, through the eyes is kinda romancy too

hi Socks
while we are talking about romance novels, and by association clopfics, socks is kinda a bad name to have :p
so...copied all the names to a list. will read them later
A btit late, but Hi Socks! :)
Ryunosuke, sexiest name ever xD
*bit

hi Socks
Socks is an awesome name!
gug...

and Sonny, I care <3 :3
np :p I was gonna go play video games, I need a break from all this drawing ;o
I've been drawing non-stop for the past 2 months now O_o
question, what is your favorite shipping?
oh well, up to some tf2
ciao
hmm
Invi http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/
jbh1145, that is an odd question
Ryunosuke i know
jbh1145 VinylTavia, but I just consider them good friends instead of something romantic
simply because there are alot of good romance stories floating about
Lil_B, oh okay ^^
jbh1145: The beast from the deep and Bill
jbh1145 Aida, sometimes the Deutsche Post
Lil_B, lool
socks i meant from mlp
jbh1145 the paper boat from the CMC
Sorry Watcher in the water
hehe Lil_B
From MLP, a tree and fluttershy
Lil_B, since when does deutsche post shipping?
Lil_B lol
pfft, ExdeathxShy al the way
Invi just wanted to say something skuriel
okay then
as I said, there are alot of good ones floating abouts, Sunshine (Flutters x OC), Through the eyes (Firewall x Luna)
Lil_B, my company does shipping :D
etc, etc, etc
Lil_B: :| stop making fun of shipping
Invi what Company do you work for?
Eli NEVER!
Lil_B, kuehne + nagel
Invi ... never heard of them :(
Eli: But it's such an easy target :P
Lil_B: and our Post is better than yours :P
Eli because you have a smaller country :P
Lil_B, yeah they are pretty unknown in germany but they are successfull as hell
Invi sounds good :)
i asked a questioin which made the chat explode
yep ^^
Ryunosuke: just for teh heck of it: who's firewall?
never ship to italy...things tend to get lost. especially in the south
the rest of europe is fine
wisdom of the day
good that i dont live there ^^
Invi don't say that when MadSurge is around :P
is he italian?
One thought on my part on Fanfictions: DON'T ship your OC with one of the mane six. srly, why would you ever think that's a good idea?
Invi yup
hehe
Eli or any pony in the show in general
or any other pony
Invi: WHO DARES SHIPPING IN MY PRESENCE :[
or non ponies
MadSurge xD
DaringDerpy: nah shipping is fun
Invi x MadSurge
lool
Lil_B: :D
or castles, or bears, or trees
especially trains
Idk even if Invi's a dude :D
Deacon: yep. forget OCs. Human X Pony are 2^63 times worse
^
2^63? that is more than 2^62 wow
Deacon: i once read a clopfic with twilight and her table. to this day i don't know why i cliked on it... and actually went through with reading...:'(
i do like the spike x rarity ship cause it is kinda cute though it isnt my favorite
eli, that actually, depends on the situation
:p
see: through the eyes :p
sounds interesting, Eli
jbh1145 but spikes a little kid rarity is by my guess 20ish
Eli well, the hilarious once are the best, although I only ever read one, I'm not much of a reader xD
DaringDerpy: it was mind scarring. but yeah...
Eli ...interesting
if it doesn'T kill us...
the thing with spike, is that dragon aging is significantly different from human, or even pony aging standards
like dogs and humans
DaringDerpy: it only makes us stranger
yeah i know like i said its not my favorite
haha
Eli, how is such a fic possible?
wait
I don'tz wanna know
DaringDerpy: *Jokersmile*
let me put it this way, a dog year is like 6 human years
or something such
Invi: you DON'T wanna know...
two words: Animal Husbandry
:p
so many twilight table fanfics...no chance to find this one
...
Ryunosuke: you are starting to scare me a bit...
DaringDerpy: really?
wasn't there a fic of trixie and a pinecone? how was that one?
twilight x books can be... awkward too
hey all are we watching anything? my screens buffering :/
Invi sing the "Dick in a Box" song, and replace Box with Table, at lest that would be an Idea... wait, that doesn't work with females /).-
spike could be like 3-4 in dragon years but he is probably like 15-16 in pony years
least*
Theakman why nothing atm good sir/madam
Ok when is stuff getting played UK time?
jbh let me look something up
Lil_B, except the table has a storage room...
Theakman: On the weekdays, stuff is streamed at random times
Invi ...
Theakman depends, usually on weekdays just random stuff or nothing at all
jbh1145: nay. i believe he's as old as the CMC. mentally as physically
yea probably
Ok thanks everypony /) peace out
wait, you can join us....
aww :(
so y isnt spike dating one of the cmc?
such an intresting, slightly crazy, conversation going on...
love it
mmhmm
Bouncing baby bunnies burning brightly
:|
eli...it was the wrong twilight
wut?
hundreds of vampire fanfics
hello everypony
DaringDerpy: Dat AJ :3
DaringDerpy: ug... vampire fanfics
quick question. Who do I have to contact, if I accidently clicked the "quit Newsletter" link?
okay the closest I could find table wise is this
Ryunosuke: not sure if i want to know
maybe spike should date sweetie belle, cuase she is techinally a smaller rarity, just my threoy
Haven't been here in forrreeevvveeer
wb then alpha
jbh1145: probably hundreds of fics like that flowing around
lali-ho [Alpha], I remember you :D
[Alpha]: youp. welcome back
thank you Invi and Eli

Deacon: I'm remembered? Sweet
that is the CLOSEST I could find to dragon ages
Lil_B, has german luna and chryssy the same voice?
regarding MLP
Invi: who even watches that?
Invi I don't think so, sounded really different, but Luna and Nighmare Moon are the sam VA
Eli, i sometimes
ohey [Alpha]
Lil_B, that would make sense though :)
Eli, the twily goes insane scene was very good
Ryunosuke but in the english version, they are different :P
Eli I watch it :)
Sup. I haven't been on because of the mlp game on iOS market and skyrim :3
hmms
huh, that game that addicting?
Invi: it has no squee! NO squee :'( fluttershy cries!
[Alpha], I would play that, but... bluestacks doesnt like the android version yet :p
the frontend keeps crashing
I wanna know why the MLP game is incompatible with my version of Android, yet the new Angry Birds game is :<
because angry birds is a sellout
Eli, that is true but that scene ist still awesome
bluestacks is looking at a fix though
Kind of but I screwed myself in the game so I have to equal it out
btw, someone ... "finished" that mlp game :p
Invi and I think Cadence and Chrysalis have the same VA
Finished?
the game says it needs Android 2.3 and up to work and I have 2.3.4
Lil_B, idk, maybe. i have t rewatch that episode ^^
as close to finishing as one can get
let me dig up the linky
Invi: and i watched fairy odparents or whatever it's called when i was little. can't hear spikes voice :P
In fact I'm playing Skrim right now :P
Eli, timmy has the same voice. you must be deaf if you don't hear it ^^
Invi: that's what i just stated
actually timmy's va is tara strong
^
Deacon: german MLP
Eli, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHLPg7VNfgM&feature=plcp
oh, german, ok
Deacon: in the german version, spike got german timmy's voice
Eli yeah, the german voice for spike is a VA that does Dubs for +10 years, did tons of Cartoons and Animes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR3JdMLAQBs
Geez I've banned youtube poop n my home
[Alpha], so what do you do when a YTP comes up on the stream?
[Alpha]: i don't see what's funny in 95% of those...
YTP
Invi I'm listening to find a Pet "Überirdisch, Übermächtich ... " ganz kla, Tier muss Arisch sein xD
Same here Eli it's repetitive penis jokes
Lil_B, ikr? and instead of Haustier: Lieblingstier. also the singer VA is too different from the speaking va. the voice changes completely ^^
yeah, RDs singing voice sounds way different :/
[Alpha]: right? nothing against a little immature joke from time to time, but 5 minutes of bullshit?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=EFKTJBrLBoU -- SPOILERS,, NMM wins :p
afk
Invi: how did they voice "Lieblingstier" in pet?
(ikr? now really afk)
There are some good YTPs. What I see in YTP is a drive to cause the viewer to go What the Heck? at it. It's been corrupted and degraded in a similar manner as trolling. I like a good YTP, but just reediting dialog to change their words into profanity isn't a good YTP.
Although I watch gamerpoop it's much more original and funny. Have you ever seen Bulgraf from skyrim break dance?
I usually like the ones that are episodic
What is YTP?
Eli I guess Haustier didn't work, for the song :( or the Translator was High.... again...
[Alpha], Youtube Poop
NOT THAT SONG FROM CUPCAKES!!!!
Oh I sometimes dislike abbreviations
Lil_B: what is pet again... whatever... something with Tier...
Oh I mute it when youtube poop is streamed to answer an earlier question
Eli Pet = Haustier
what are good youtube poop?
Lil_B: i was trying to sarcasticly imitate the translator. I think i'm still capable of tranlating pet... but i forgot not to use sarcasm over the internet again, didn't I?
Eli you forgot to give an Indicator :)
The YTPs by Kajetokun is pretty funny, Walrusguy did some god ones until he left Youtube...
Lil_B: i know, i know... i'm just not used to not using sarcasm
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHr5mi9graw&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPllpzxmM5k gamerpoop
Eli really
And yes, some of these are pretty dirty and of course I don't enjoy the dirty parts.
...okay, that doesn't go without saying nowadays.
Eli I mean , reeeeaaaalllllyyyy?
Lil_B: not a good trait right?
08,01urgh, hasbro...

/me 08,01bashes his head against the wal repeatedly
Eli depends, I don't know how much you use it everyday and in which situations :)
08,01because it's less painful than dealing with Hasbro
Lil_B: pfff heads... they grow back
08,01some stuff has come to light now that just boggles my mind
such as?
08,01i can't really talk about the details

Is it a smiley on the webclient?
She
"She's got her own notebook and quill"
Eli extra!
Lil_B: cool :D i like crazy people.
Vivix good, I thought the dub got it wrong because all the Fanart I saw portraied it as male
aah
or the generall shape of the doll seemed more male than female :/
Doll?
Smarty pants
Lil_B: the fanfictions portrait her as female... another one of the stories i would like to erase from my mind
Lil_B: where are the MIB when your really need them?
Eli I ddon't read FanFic :P
08,01smartypants fanfic...

08,01i read a really good/horrific Sesame Street r34 fic on yuletide...
I have so much to catch up on now that I'm done with some projects-

08,01it involved oatmeal.

08,01Vivix: nope
08,01Vivix: but i know the one you mean
Vivix, thats oscar
We had a different sesame in Norway- so only seen a few of them
oscar the grouch
I don't like oatmeal.
08,01i found out recently that oatmeal and porridge are actually different
oh yeah
porridge is ... creamier isnt it?
I love rice-milk-porridge, but rarely enjoy oatmeal
porridge ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
08,01i have covered myself in porridge before, but i've never tried oatmeal
uhh
08,01i'll have to give it a go at some point
Mmm
I dont want to know
I've always thought custard sounded nice, both to eat and swim in
but I've never tried either
11,02...I want to go to Dennys now and gt a Grand Slam

Hmm- sounds nice
08,01SuperBrony64: what does a Grand Slam consist of?
11,02Whatever you want
Ahh assassinating people in Skyrim. It never ceases to amuse me.
Sounds like some kind of crazy pizza with hamburgers on it-
I wish there were a Dennys in my town
11,02Four items out of a list of breakfast items, one of which includes oatmeal
08,01ah
i went to denny's once, and only once, it took a good hour and a half to get our meal :(

Sick?
SuperBrony64 me too, I want some action
AHAHAHAHAH
ninja gaiden 3, what a joke
hey Bronysith
again :)
it doesnt deserve the ninja gaiden title
nah just didn't feel like going, lol
why? CAUSE IT IS FUCKING EASY THATS WHY
lol
Bronysith agreed
got a lot of sick time saved anyway
ninja gaiden=/= easy
Bronysith they remade it, now with better controlls, harder difficulty, more blood
11,02^
i dare someone to write a great fanfic in 5 minutes with exactly 1000 words no more no less
ninja gaiden+Easy=ammonia+bleach

hey a new poster just arrived, wanna see it?
I can't type that fast
sure
on the other hand, it's not out yet xD and I generally don't believe things about games anymore that are just based on the word of mouth
Or fast in general
13http://i.imgur.com/MKaah.gif?1
oki i'll upload it
I like to see gameplay and reviews after the official release
13so apparently the wii u basic doesn't have enough storage for one game
13stay classy consoles
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352899956256.png
08,01http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13375357/proper-use-cases-for-android-usermanager-isuseragoat
Memory issues with the wii u I've read up on that
Shizuka I guess the basic model is only for Savestates or WiiWare Titles, but that's why you can use external HDs
oh wow, it's been just a few days and the Akinator already knows King Sombra
Lil_B: so any obscure games from the SNES era? :D
that has got to be a massive fail Shizuka
Wow, it's actually useable-
brb, going to class anyways >_>
haha ok
still not seeing me buy that shit
Ou can only use one external hard drive and it can only be used on the wii u once formatted
11,02Shizuka: That's for one game though, other games don't use as much space.
You
what game are you guys talking about
13correction, the wii u basic does not have enough storage for more than one game
13i can't hear you over the sound of my 80+ steam games :)
Shizuka: IKR?
tch
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352908274795.gif BEHOLD! THE ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE
steam is nice
Shizuka: Nice
11,02Plus, there's only two reasons to getting the white console, you either love the color white to death, or they ran out of the black deluxe one and you're making do with what they have left.
13actually it's more like 120+ but i didn't install most of the id pack
11,02Shizuka: You can attach a 3 TB drive to the Wii U and use that for storing games.
13you still have to buy more just to use your console the way they want you to :)
I don't think they will make that many games
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352890784347.jpg "This is what spike grows up to be"
oh myh
*my
Gosh
11,02Or buy games on discs, which is what they anticipate for those who get the white console.
13pff discs
11,02Or they're using the extra money to buy the extra storage
13ancient tech
Uses 25gb blu ray disks
disc > usb *hugs old stuff*
:)
Can't use it as a bluray player though
I smile when everyone talks about distribution of games and such
when i get the wii u im getting the black one
11,02It's not a blu-ray disc though
[Alpha] no Blue Rays, to much pattens money for SONY, they made their own 25GB discs
DEFINTALY
^
11,02It's similar but a proprietary format
I smile, because without p2p and emulators, that would probbably not have happened :)
hence nintendo/sony stores :0
11,02But having the ability to plug in a huge amount of storage without forcing users to only use built-in storage was a good move on Nintendo's part.
I like the idea of the wii u though but I'm not getting it anytime soon
Lil_B: why u no answer :(
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Cadance Toss
...
MadSurge answer on what? (repeat you question, I had a 20 sec outage :P )
of all the things that came out of s3 premier, we get the cadence cannon game
:)
Lil_B: any obscure SNES games lately? :D
What I liked hte most with consoles was just using the disc, not installing, anything, so- I think that sounds nice on the WiiU if I understood it correctly
Wow they made a cadence toss game already
hmm obscure snes games
what games do you want for the wii u
MadSurge what dio you mean? If I played any recently?
Ryunosuke: and bug eyed Twilight :D
[Alpha] this fandom works fast
MadSurge, true :)
Lil_B: yes

and also that G word
I noticed xD
Ryunosuke: those are worthwile memes :D

MadSurge nope, haven't played much latly anyway :/ and currently playing Cossacks
I'm gonna need a new computer soon
the premier DID give a new meaning to Pinkie Shy :)
Lil_B: what's that?
the premiere
god
i liked the premiere
Lol I have that picture
"HURR DURR, a commercial aired during our show, lets make a meme out of it HURR DURR"
alexxm: same
god
11,02jbh1145: I plan on getting Mew Super Mario Bros. U, Call of Duty Black Ops II, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and Nintendo Land. I also might get Ninja Gaiden because it looks awesome.
Bronysith: ssh, concentrate on the Cadence launcher
Mew
11,02Moooo
MOOOO
MadSurge an age of ampires like game, just with more units, and it'sa the 16-18th century
did somebody say Mew? http://derpy.me/ZYq4s
O.o I was just noting a spell error which was funny
Bronysith: gаk>>>gangnam
@SuperBrony64 For me New SUper Mario Bros U, Sonic Racing Transformed, Nintendo Land(well it comes with the dexluxe set so duh)
Lil_B: I c
13http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-2-weapon-chart.png
For games in the future, Rayman Legends, Pikmin 3, and Smash Bros U
im not a fan of call of duty
Shizuka: all those weapons and not one plasma rifle or a BFG :(
11,02jbh1145: You getting it at launch?
I think I'll probably be switching to pc gaming soon
13looks like six weapons to me
13with randomized stats
11,02Shizuka: That chart
SuperBrony64 starting of slowly, ZombiU, Lego City Undercover, The Wonderful 101, Bayonetta 2 and mayxbe Tank!Tank!Tank
13does not contain gun that shoots shurikens and lightning
Shizuka: EXACTLY
11,02I'm for sure getting Bayonetta 2 when it comes out :D
only for wii u is bullshit
11,02jbh1145: Awesome! :D
13the whole "modern war shooter" thing is hilariously stifling
Lil_B Oh i forget about lego city
By the way, is Painkiller available on steam?
i wonder what the wii u version of arkham city has thats new
13MadSurge: ofc
MadSurge: yup
13cheap too
probably will get that
11,02Bronysith: Again, it eouldn't exist without Nintendo's help.
11,02wouldn't*
hey everypony :)
black ops 2 the game with a score of 86 but a user score of 3.0
Shizuka: another game to hoarde and play on a better computer later :$
11,02Really?
how've you been Sketch_Toku_Brony
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony !
really
13course the wii u is going to be the first technological upgrade consoles have had in seven years so
Vivix: oh right
:P{
so probably late december
alexxm im good :)
Vivix: you spending any money on there? i cant cause im saving to get a hotel room for a con
13remember, when xbox 360 came out, having two threads execute in the same cycle was the newest big deal, multicore processors weren't even a thing
:) hey
Probably not, but if anything amazing pops up I probably will, Usually only buy one or two when there's a big sale
13now, asuka can run 12 threads in the same cycle, consoles can't even come close to PC
That is true
Consoles does make it cheaper for us to buy gcards though
Shizuka: you named your pc asuka?
13quantitatively asuka is over six times more advanced than the 360
if you look at it this way: Console keeps game-specs down
I'm excited for new consoles. If nothing else, then because I'm a gamer at heart, and while graphics aren't everything, they sure look nice.
i hope the wii u will be a great launch and not like the 3ds and ds launch
^
13Bronysith: you just now learned?
it probably will though cause a mario game is a launch game
well it should be looks like it has some good launch games
13except the wii was released seven years ago and hasn't changed since
13of course the wii u is better than it
:I
Seven years ago? Jeez-- I feel old
So much truth
Ikr?
Shizuka: nope, but you did confirm the suspicions
11,02But the size of the components hasn't changed drastically which is amazing imo
Vivix i agree
kids still going on with the console vs pc war ?
just enjoy your games and get on with it
not a war per se
13right, because tech has improved since then, it's just wii u is *just now* catching up
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: YES
There's been no mud or fire yet
I'm going with the flow here
agreed TheGreatAndPowerfulT /)
13sony's apparently crashing hard, i'll be impressed if there is a PS4
i play mostly on consoles but i still play tf2 and minecraft on pc
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thank you, another person to represent the flag
Shizuka: there is a persona 4
XD i know what you mean though
13as for microsoft, between windows 8 and their insistence on kinect, i'm wondering if they'll make it to a new generation of consoles
Playstation 4
I hope so
i like windows 8 FLAME SHILED READY
i think xbox is leaving the gaming race
We'll just have to wait and see, it wouldn't be the first console to vanish
nope
I think the ps3 and Xbox 360 is slowly dying now
W8 Isn't that bad- most of the flair is optional, and so is appstore
I've yet to personally try it though
but doesnt matter to me, i have my playstation 3 mostly for games i find on the PSN, AKA Legend of dragoon, FFVI-VIII, persona 3 later on
We have a PS3, but I haven't touched it in ages
I want the new generation of gaming consoles now so I can play Kingdom Hearts 3
i hope wii u will dominate in sales like the wii did
I played Red dead on it, that's about it-
[Alpha]: Being a PC only gamer, I'd say that's a good thing, but consoles are good if you don't want to spend money on a gaming rig.
True
11,02You have to remember though, there's a difference Shizuka between hardware that can play games and hardware designed specifically to play games. The components may be weaker than what you get on computers, but they are designed specifically just for games and also to keep costs low. Besides, games on consoles only have to push games out on a 1080p display whereas most hardcore gamers
11,2have displays that are double that resolution anyway.
13but that's the thing
13what makes it to PC is dumbed down ports
I'm not big on pc but they started it all
/me does not have over 1080, does not want over 1080
what game systems do you guys own?
Personally? Just a computer
13developers that think releasing a game on PC with an FOV of 65 need to lose their kneecaps
11,02Because PCs aren't as big of a focus compared with consoles.
Yeah, my screen is 1920x1200. I tell you, finding wallpapers is a hell.
13it's holding the medium back
Shizuka: FOV of 65? That sounds terrible.
It is holding back in certain departments yeah
I find wallpapers that exceed that KammerJunk
Especially controll, feedback and graphics is being held down by porting
11,02Call of Duty used to be a PC game, but since Modern Warfare 2, you can easily see that the games are designed with concoles in mind first and PCs second.
13Kammerjunk: halo 2, the big "hey look directx 10 on vista" release, was locked to 65
yeah, consoles are a bigger market-
I like the mods on pc though. They make the game more enjoyable
Jeez-
what is your favorite wii game?
http://i.imgur.com/dyEeE.jpg oh Shizuka
[Alpha]: Yeah, but most wallpapers are 1080p. Then again, I suppose I just have to look for anything in 16:10 with 1920x1200 as a minimum size.
Super Smash brothers Brawl
13i already have that one silly
the mario galaxy games for me
11,02So think of it this way, do I want to go out and built an $800+ computer to play CoD or buy an Xbox 360 for $250.
[Alpha], I have to agree with that, mods do make a game more enjoyable most times
11,02Plus convenience and simplicity factor in a lot with buying a concole.
I liked the mlp mods On skyrim. They are funny but need some work
dem mods
13if you're building a computer over $800, you're not building it for COD
13you're building it for better games
^]
Ryunosuke: And that's why I can't play Bethesda games on anything else than PC.
Shizuka: i didnt spend 1800$ to play CoD thats for sure
13if you want to build a computer for COD you buy a system from 2004
you guys are gonna kill me, but I play skyrim on PC with no mods
That reminds me, I need a horse mod for Skyrim- their butts are all wrong
and I know how to install them :P
I'll have to build a pc when I get the chance. It sounds like fun.
Mourekai, I usually do the same until about 2 years after release
Mourekai: That's alright. But FYI, there are clients like the Nexus Mod Manager that do all the work for you.
13again, because consoles are so out of date, making the price comparison now is moot
http://i.imgur.com/TLKKb.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/nQx3p.jpg ಠ_ಠ
11,02Maybe so, but from my perspective, I would rather buy a console than a gaming computer. I love hooking it up to my TV and picking up a controller and I'm ready to play.
[Alpha]: Call me crazy, but building a PC is great fun.
13but then the next gen console comes out
13now you have to buy new hardware
13PC is already running smoothly at that level
11,02But for what concoles do, it's still good enough to push out the same games that can be found on PCs albeit with some tweaking.
Thanks for the feedback. I will try it when I get a job >.>
13and the next gen after that, PC is still waiting to need the upgrade
SuperBrony64, I don't see anything wrong with that, but it is two different systems and 'cultures' between PC and Consoles
if your pc can run crysis you dont need to update
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsAR25SnUGY
13Bronysith: 60fps solid through the whole game, all settings maxed :)
I can run several crysis'es ontop of eachother
Shizuka: hell yea
13even AA which guarantees rendering lag
11,02Vivix: Indeed, but the argument 'LULZ MY P4 PC CAN OUTPERFORM AN XBOX 360' is just tiring.
Shizuka: you're good for a few decades of gaming
I some times try to run SWTOR and EVE Online at the same time. Good gracious, TOR can eat resources.
I have aa on max on everything I own- even with my old computer- never really suffered , CPU picks up tons of slack
13SuperBrony64: the core of the issue is what PC is getting these days is half assed ports of console games that completely ignore the platform they're moving to
13i do not sit six feet from my monitor, i don't need to look at the screen like it's a telescope
Shizuka: also DUAL MONITORS
Porting is an issue though, it really really breaks some games on release, or forever
13i have a controller with 102 inputs, you can give me more options to interact with the game
but that's a dev-argument more than a consumer one
I have bad eyesight so I sit like 5 inches away from my computer screen x(
Bronysith: I don't think I can live without at least two monitors anymore.
[Alpha], you know, that's what glasses are invented for?
I do like that we are not bashing each other :)
11,02PCs are for those who want to push the limit of games and mod them like crazy, consoles are for simplicity, they are 'plug and play' friendly.
Kammerjunk: i need to get it set up like the jigsaw killer, get like 10 monitors up in this bitch
two monitors limit your GPU
Exactly
[Alpha]: I'm just -0.75 and -1.00, so I sometimes forget to put in my lenses when I'm sitting at my computer.
it's not good unless you have multicore or sli/cf
am i the only one who wants a mario galaxy 3?
Invi: all my glasses fall apart of their own accord
Mourekai: Who doesn't have multicore these days, though?
I mean multicore GPU
I don't use two monitors, never saw the point, did before- but now I have a U824 soundcard- and the mixer takes up the entire screen
like 690
Oh.
i have no idea what multicore means but i'm sure i have it
[Alpha], what do you do with them?
Nothing
11,02jbh1145: I want it...but if they can make a Super Mario 3D Land like game on the Wii U...I'm much more in favor of that :)
13Vivix: life on screen one, bronystate on screen two
The thing is, i am sick of this console VS pc gaming argument, games are fun,, hell even though i play PC games more often than console, WE all share the same flag that is gaming, i was raised on an N64, SNES, PS2, xbox, gamecube and PC, and i loved all the games i played on em, so if you enjoy a game then GAME THE FUCK ON
Shizuka: But what if they're the same?
Hehe, yeah- I'm super used to one monitor though, but the mixer is--eating my screen
13only during streams
[Alpha], then change the manufacturer
looking at your guys pc specs make me jealous, my pc sucks for gaming, it can really only play tf2 and minecraft
13in which case stream on 1, irc on 2
Good point.
For streaming and modding I would want two screens
I haven't bout glasses in 3 years
modding as in administrating
Bought
We used three screens in the main studio at my school, but we only used the center one <,<
[Alpha] do you have to drive a car?
13Bronysith: it's the sense that everyone knows games can do better, but they won't because they're developing for decade old hardware
and im using an hp all in one so i cant replace anything
Not yes
Yet
jbh1145: Well, you can just build on it progressively. I add some RAM here, a harddrive there.
13so it's the indies that actually evolve the medium
Shizuka: this is true
[Alpha], then it is fine yet
jbh1145: Oh. Never mind then.
13minecraft alone shows the problem :3
http://www.trondertun.no/uploads/bilder/galleri/Lyd/lydstudio.jpg studio at my old school
Vivix: that you?
Vivix: I am so jelly, you could smear me on toast.
are any of you anticipating DayZ full?
oh nono, it's a promo shot from their website
/me asks to be ignored.
Vivix: so that is you then
pony_017447: Alrighty then!
noo ;__;
13but anyway
Vivix: NOW U FUCKED UP
/me hugs hard
Vivix: Wait, are you Norwegian?
Yeah
you cant replace the video card which is the only thing i need to replace to get at least playable framerates
I think it's sad though. 18 and can't drive x(
Neat!
I'm 23 and I can't drive-
you are danish right?
or am I confusing you with someone
Yup.
i'm 18 and i'm currently learning how to drive
Woo, memory
No
Well I can drive....just not legally ....
I can crash.
unless there is some crazy thing like a pci to pci express adapter which im sure there isnt
yeah mainly because your eyesight is so bad ^^
I can crash too
I think there is jbh, but a PCIe motherboard is cheap
oh that sucks [Alpha]
i dont know if i can replace the motherboard on my all in one
You should be able to replace everything, unless it's--something weird, or rented
My eyesight is borderline so I can drive without glasses weird right?
/me googles all in one
plusthe power supply on it is only 150 watts, wayyyy to little for a normal video card
oh no way it's just a screen?
oh my
mine's 850 watts
I don't even remember what my power supply is.
back again :P
I usually forget my stats, but my computer is still new
Class was only 20 minutes today
I think I'll take my computer to a pro. I don't want to screw it up >.>
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: The Pickup
Up until 2011 I used p4 3.2ghz processor
so thats y i do want to build a new computer
most games wouldn't lag- even played GTA4 on it
but im saving money for the wii u
so i probably cant for a long time yet
Oh. It's 850W as well.
yay wattage brothers
Bronysith it's also fun :D
jbh1145: I have an all in one too and the main reason why I want a new computer.
I didn't even know it existed, that's crazy
okay my specs are
I have 850W too, yay!
/me dance
Well this just goes over my head
CPU: Intel Pentium Dual Core E5500 2.8 GHZ
13lul dual core
Bronysith: :D
good old dual core
GPU: Intel Chipset G43/G45 (very weak)
I used to have E7200 OC
13ouch
I'm not walking up to my computer to tell you my specs.
13that's not a GPU, that's a potato
i7 2600 3.4ghz 16gb ram, 1tb hdd, GTX670, U284 Audio
Shizuka: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/31b12eb082f88f012230ea47598a1324.jpg
ok, battlestation parade?
RAM 4 GB Running Windows 8 Pro 64-bit
13AJ as asuka, mmk
What I .....whatever
AJ as asuka?
yeaaaaaaaa no
Ikr
so yeah its not that great
Yeah- not that good
works, though
13well at least you're getting all 4GB of ram
what a waste of time.
:
I like the style ok :|
:P
it can run tf2 and minecraft okay but thats pretty much it
rockin' that dual core
Yep
Hen...shin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D79FpFkAV84 :D
lol
beast
13the chipset is what kneecaps the whole thing
Lol
thats a pretty decent sized crowd.
You should rent it for just yourself once anyway :P
13intel integrated has no business trying to pass off as a graphics unit
Mine isn't either. It's only got 4gb of ram but I'm thinking of updating it to 16gb later and maybe find out how to get a new visual card into it. If not new computer it is.
I just need to replace that chipset with a real gpu then games will at least be playable
they kind of made me mad
I was going to do something cool, like let everyone vote via text message for the next episode
but they don't allow you to just plug a laptop in
13you can get tf2 to run better by severely downgrading the graphics, but minecraft is about the most you can ask from intel integrated
you need to burn them a disc and they play it.
its retarded.
=/
Minecraft is a totall monster of java
lol dat Cadance toss game
@Shizuka i do that
what's their reason for that?
because stupid.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: so going in the bad pony oc tumblr
13and yeah java's an unapologetic hog and you'll have to decrease render distance to make minecraft smooth but it's functional
Good job, Shining Armor!
Weird I'm participating >.>
Bronysith: lol nah i just like drawing :D
of course
Sketch_Toku_Brony: and this stops me how?
I wonder if it'll ever be rewritten in another language
they also make you pay licensing fees
Bronysith: well if you wanna do an OC tumblr i wont stop ya :$
I hope those 70 people aren't all the creepy guys from that brony group...
Sounds like an OC tumblr would be a pain
40 of them are from vancouver
minecraft does run pretty well when everything is low but some textures appear black
which is like an hour away
but they wanna drive.. so whatever.
Im not giving any weridos rides.
the black texture is a bug in the game
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdf5d49N8e1rncbeqo1_500.jpg dafuq
so that happens on every system
MAN the actor for Katsumi/Eternal can sing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZiJwasME2o
5750? i used to have one of those
I suck at reading ATI names-
nice cards
take a beating
even my hand in the game turns black sometimes
oh wow, that I've never seen
Vivix, i have never seen that myself
the signs sometimes turn black sometimes too
13that would be intel
Intel sucks
13naturally generated overhangs with black lighting is a big
It's a shadow-bug, isn't it? I've seen it a few times, many times actually
13black textures on their own is intel
also
topic
intel makes great cpus but they suck with gpus
"rip dad"
ohh, okay
who?
Amd makes alright cpus but great gpus, see the pattern
13i've heard sandybridge is supposed to be better but i just don't see intel coming close to discrete cards
Hmm
http://www.dorkly.com/comic/46282/the-people-you-see-at-a-midnight-release
aww :(
integrated seems to be mainly for 2d acceleration for UI- running games on it is kinda crazy
Wow I've been more interested in this than Skyrim
13indeed it's probably impossible as an integrated graphics chip has to share thread time with the main CPU and draws its graphics memory from main RAM
[Alpha]: what game?
though nvidia makes the best gpus, thats a fact
nVidia vs AMD is a battle I never got into- but I've preferred nVidia for ages
13nvidia's stomping AMD into the ground, i only picked up the radeon build because it was cheaper than the comparable nvidia
[Alpha]: what game?
13now and then i regret it
Skyrim
Hello :)
And this chat
[Alpha]: you said you were more interested in this than skyrim
GTX670 is something I--don't regret buying, but honestly, I could not seee any improvement in games
13this == chat
08,01i generally get nvidia because it's easier to get working with Linux
but it will keep me updated ofr quite a while
08,01or rather, it has been historically
[Alpha]: do u play the fallout series by chance?
13for me it was a huge improvement from the geforce 8300gs i'd been stuck on for two years
plz i want to build a new computer to play battlefield 3
13and from there a big improvement from the fx5200 i'd been on since 04 <<
Yes
is there any stream going on ???
[Alpha]: which is your fav fallout game then?
I can't remember the name of my old card
yes i could play it on my ps3 but its not really the true exprenice
To be honest
The biggest improvement I felt was when I upgraded from P4 3.2ghz to i7 3.4
it was like--walking out of a cube of slime
It's on my things to do list
[Alpha]: what?
help me D: im addicted to that gameloft app!
is there any stream going on ???
13i can make asuka chug hard but dual monitors means i make her do a whole lot more than my previous boxen
its like playing tf2 on the console orange box game
Rocket, nope
nobody plays it
Invi thanks, i just thought i have epic lag :3
...when was actually the last stream?
Dual takes out quite a lot huh? I haven't had dual since... well, years
13it's not a lot as far as i can tell
i need to name my pc
Even though I don't really want it- I kinda want to consider it due ot my new audiocard-
Invi last night at least thats the last time i saw one
im wondering what would be a good build for around 1000 dollars?
I don't name anything. Well except I named my iPad awesome >.>
I think I'll stick with one- for now- desk is small
jbh1145: go for 1500$
13screen two is generally just putty and skype, and while putty is constantly updating to demonstrate the network connection is still live, it's not exactly crysis on screen two
Hehe, true
silly putty? ^^
whats putty
13ssh client
if I had two, I would want to run eh dspmixer or something on the second-
im good enough with 1000 dollars, i dont care about getting the best framerate, i just want to at least play it
what is ssh?
oh, here's that poster i got http://i.imgur.com/RxGqn.jpg?1
Secure shell? *sucks at netstuff*
did you steal it
Oh yay, AOL
I use it during GIT, apparently, but I suck at git too
Just what I've always wanted
from like toys r us or something
so any suggestions?
I'm out techy stuff just goes over my head but it makes me wanna research it so that I'll be more knowledgable in that area

"Who the hell decided that Bronies/Pegasisters were founded on the idea of "Love and Tolerance?"
Because that certainly isn't the case nowadays."
or "future" things
11,02Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
"Oh yeah? well my comments aren't just smart and whitty, they also contain racial slurs."
yeah but if thats the case then i dont want them to get their cutie marks till 2045 :D Ponies 4ever!
"nigger"
hehe
Booyah
but yeah if they got them- we would probably see less of them, but you never know
is anyone else just getting a buffer on their screen?
"Shaylee is a girl who has fantasies of being chained to a wall as a zombie."
"like feathered fuckass and horny asswaffle?"
No Im getting muffins
stay classy..
:P
I'm on a chat client
No Buffer show is on you sillieh :3
Vivix: maybe itll time skip and theyll pass the CMC title onto...Pound and Pumpkin maybe?
:D
Oh and theres a thread about some sort of erotic fanfiction im not going to open.
Sketch_Toku_Brony well i can't find it but it's a picture of the madoka girls as riders
Sketch_Toku_Brony: and then Egophiliac came into the show :D
alexxm ah its cool :)
MadSurge: lol
Holla everypony! :)
hello GilDash :)
heya GilDash :)
Guten Tag GilDash
Hi GilDash and Alchemist
moin GilDash
http://www.halolz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/halolz-dot-com-wreckitralph-tf2crossover.jpg
Ohai GilDash :)
Hi guys!
Heya Alchemist :)
how are things Alchemist
Alchemist: Holla! :)
Hello Alchemist :)
Hi Alchemist :)
hi Alchemist
just jumped in quick, Im exhausted and wont stay long.
:)
Alchemist: :O how so?
ohai GilDash :)
Alchemist: I know that feeling.
anypony here?
Nope.
^
We all left ages ago.
:C
MadSurge: was at uni from 8 in the morning till 8 in the evening with literally NO break
Im back
God damn internet cut out for a moment
Alchemist: Damn, you're made of iron
i just wanted to say how dissapointed i was at sombra
I was going through Facebook. I didn't leave.
and i cant wait for the sseasons end, twi has something coming
Sombra's legacy will go on
lets not discuss S3 pls
:S
Hey Nittany_Discord. Played BO2 at all yet?
I have a feeling that we may meet him again later.
Well, yesterday I went to work, came back and did nothing but write and iron until about 11 o'clock. Then I basically was passing out, so I decided to sleep. XD
Needs more buss
man the new DmC coming 2013 looks awesome! wish so many hard core fans werent sooo bitchy :| all because of Dante's look and other pointless stuff
/me rides around in the shizubus
sombra was the only villan to actually be killed
13beep beep
makes sense hed come back
Rainbow_Swaggin: since G1
11,01Played a bit last night.
Rainbow_Swaggin: he's made out of darkness
13after my pizza comes out i think we will need to have some bus
Sketch_Toku_Brony: how is that pointless?
13i wonder if i can take a bus through a car wash
Sketch_Toku_Brony: it would be like completely rearanging the mona lisa man
So...Nightmare moon basicly being wiped from existince doesnt count as being killed?
13that and you guys need to show me where the super swingset is
Nittany_Discord: Whadaya think?
nightmare moon wasnt an actual pony though
it was like an altered state of mind of lunas
She was still destroyed though
SpadeMagnes[School: isnt Nightmare moon luna?
Hi everybody.
Hello Meanwhile :)
heya Meanwhile :)
Sap mean
Hi Meanwhile
Meanwhile:
And Im sure being turned to stone is considered to be lethal (aka doscord)
hi Meanwhile
Hi Meanwhile :)
i feel like nightmare moon is going to come back though
perhaps as a final showdown of s3
Shizuka: Next time you do GTA4 try to find a way to turn off car friction
Meanwhile: Holla! :)
Shit will be so cash
perhaps thats what the book was for luna was holding at the end of ep2
im gonna play some pokemon white 2
11,01I can't make a judgement yet. It's not the best game ever though.
Meanwhile: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/37beccebbf98ec9a81674cd357e44637.jpg surprise!
11,02Derpy Hooves X Fluttershy OTP
Nittany_Discord: of course not
All these updates
SuperBrony64 X Nintenod OTP :3
Nittany_Discord: whoever says BO2 is the best game ever is fuckign wrong
11,02O3O
MadSurge: Best disguise.
ninteno*
bo2 is probably shit
11,02Black Ops II is the best game ever...and I haven't even played it yet :D
im not buying it
cant spell for shit today =w=
SuperBrony64: o u
13SpadeMagnes[School: it's a config file somewher
The fact my dad saw people camping outside gamestop for BO2 at midnight dissapoints me
Meanwhile: I wanna see her dress up as each mane 6 :D even herself
Bronysith: i guess but its just irritating seeing so many people still hate it despite looking past stuff like Dante's new look and what not and not look at the improvement in gameplay,ya know?
BO2? You mean Call of Modern Greyfare 902?
*despite NOT looking
oh i meant borderlands 2 :D
11,01SpadeMagnes[School: That's the power of brand loyalty.
SpadeMagnes[School: Lol, console casuals. Get it on steam and you just stay up till midnight on your computer.
BTW what the f*ck was up with Fluttershy when she almost bitchslapped a crystal pony? that was so out of place.
what do you take marketing or something
But you know people Sketch_Toku_Brony ! We have to bitch about shit we dont even play!
Alchemist: That was a little odd.
God forbid we play a fucking game before we say its shit....
Dart is a manly man
Alchemist: I guess she can't get angry at them
I'd say it's fair to judge a game in a series if the past several games in the series have been pretty much the same.
^
Rainbow_Swaggin: not tougher, just meaner.
The hell you mean, RD has always been like that
Not really...
meanwhile, what about star wars
SpadeMagnes[School: yeah your right -_-'
you're*
Rainbow_Swaggin: those games are usually different each time
Perhaps, but (yes, even I doubt it) a game does have the potential to be quite different from its predecessors.
brony, i meant the movies
the first 3 were great then the new ones ruined it comparitively
Rainbow_Swaggin: he was talking about games, numbnuts
Woop, time to download a soundtrack.
Then there are people who bitch about when games dont do anything different and then bitch some more when they try something new
when did that air? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A4-aicXxaI&feature=g-vrec
what the hay, thats just uncalled for
MadSurge: I get she is more tolerant, but why would she even raise her arm? Even the ones with a shorter fuse were not that annoyed at the crystal ponies when they didnt remember anything.
i lold when fluttershy stepped in her own costume
that caught me off guard so much
^^
Fucking Blue Shells....
Alchemist: at least it was just that one slip up
Mornin' everyone :)
hi AdamTheDuck
Hi AdamTheDuck
Again
Morning AdamTheDuck :)
Hi AdamTheDuck :3
Ohai AdamTheDuck!
so did anyone notice the book luna held at the end?
'Lo AdamTheDuck.
/me noms on AdamTheDuck :3
MadSurge: dont get me wrong, Im not nitpicking, it was just odd.
how've you been AdamTheDuck
I would ask where Pinkie gets all those costumes, but of course: She stashes them in case of emergencies.
Rainbow_Swaggin: everyone did :D
hi AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck: Holla! :)
GilDash: In previously undiscovered empires? Actually yeah probably.
aeiou
alexxm, I've been just fine thank you, you? :)
i want to think theyre going to try and take over twis mind and make her do something horrible, and have her overcome their controls, perhaps becoming next in line for the throne
Meanwhile: This *is* Pinkie we're talking about. Overestimation is impossible.
i've been better AdamTheDuck
how even would alicorns be made?
Intercourse
>Have over 600 pokemon to catch
>only use 6
Raving furious intercourse.
Hehe
^
XD
no I really really am excited for this season because of the premiere, but the whole premiere felt like it wa setting things up
Meanwhile: 0_o :D
:D
oh god, the clopping begins
the book- their conversation, I like it
ok now im gonna play pokemo white 2
Batclop Begins.
Do I even want to fucking know who Celestia did to end up with Blueblood?
Howdy y'all!
pokemon*
really my only problem was sombra not getting any backstory
Batman x Robin OTP
Who said anything about clopping? Intercourse implies a partner.
Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
Batclop, The Dark Knight Rises (If you know what I mean.)
:D
Howdy thelonepony!
Meanwhile: just for you
:D
'Lo Everlasting_Joy.
Rainbow_Swaggin, yeah, but I feel he wasn't the focus- you know? LIke not a real Villain, but you never know, he might return with backstory
Hello Everlasting_Joy
like even if he just hated noone paying attention to him, that would have been enough to make a somewhat beleivable villan
Howdy Meanwhile and AdamTheDuck!
Rainbow_Swaggin: we could get more backstory as the season goes on
/me glomps Everlasting_Joy
Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
/me is glomped "Howdy Bronysith!"
Howdy MLP_Brovakiin!
I watched it a few more times and I think he might return- or just be the tip, it felt like it was introducing him, rather than--using him
hi Everlasting_Joy
Hey BladedWings!
Vivix: Ikr
well im gonna play some DMC 3,cya in abit :) Keepin' it SSStylish!
Sketch_Toku_Brony: :D later

Howdy Michael!
13hm...
Ohai Shizuka
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy
/me hugs Michael :).
So much chaos
Random Shizu is Best Shizu. ^^
so many cars
Meanwhile: Yeah, 'cause "Graaaah" was really scary. Hell, the crystals could have had some telepathic link that did that itself, as well as brainwash the crystal ponies.
Lets go bowling
Wait, is there a stream?
lol
How you doing Shizu? Oh I had a question as well. Do you mind if I pm?
GilDash: But...but...GRAAAAH.
AttackWithHugs: I don't think so.
AttackWithHugs: if there is i didnt know of it :D
someone tell me how to upload a video to stream?
AttackWithHugs, not that I'm aware of
Okaay
Meanwhile: Graaah to you too. :p
So is Discord the only villian to cause their own downfall?
Biggestpinkiefan, you must first learn the art of mooing.
eyyup
No stream?
SpadeMagnes|School seems so
GilDash: Sombra was probably too busy ordering his g.ak.
Biggestpinkiefan, then you have the power to stream.
/me MOOOOOO....
MOOOO!
Bawk
i dont know what g ak is
hey bronies it's still my birthday
Moo ^o^
/me moons Biggestpinkiefan
AdamTheDuck: You're evil :D.
Happy birthday kidzrul732 :)
Meanwhile: Oh, *that's* what he was saying! He went through all that trouble just to get some Gak? Talk about killer miscommunication!
Happy brithday kidzrul732
happy birthday kidzrul732
Rainbow_Swaggin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nogPSLCHvOA
Bollocks.
Is someone bring up Gak?! Please shoot me!

Happy birthday kidzrul732 :)
Moooooooo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvvPYsTXm0
hey by the way, if there is any g-word commercials during livestream, will they be censored?
Happy birthday kidzrul732
Oh I see, g.a.k is a bannable word.
/me gives a birthday giant muffin to kidzrul732
13not bannable
They should just include G.ak in the actual show like G4 Smooze.
13just autokick
kidzrul732, that would be hilarious when there's a mass kick wall if the commercial shows up
Shizuka: Oh, yeah, you're right.
08,01y''know, i would love to be joined with a tok'ra symbiote
well thats stupoid
Hey look its a football!

SpadeMagnes[School: It's a stone, you didn't make it.
Mama luigi.
toasters toast toast
Rope?
its in the instruction manual
Toasters toast bread.
SpadeMagnes[School: *turns around* NO
If you toast toast you're going to end up with incredibly crisp toast.
kidzrul732: probably not
i love super toast
So what tge fuck was bowser doing with that shitload of toasters?
Oh jeezus, suddenly Skype is catching up on my phone
he didnt have a toaster repairpony to help
Meanwhile: I like it slightly charred though. Just before it goes black, when it's a nice deep brown is best.
AttackWithHugs: what u mean?
GilDash: I don't even like toast.
SpadeMagnes|School he planned to destroy the world
POWDERED...TOAST...MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
That said, I do stick bread in the toaster, not toast. XD
BladedWings, did a factory reset on my phone and just redownloaded Skype

Meanwhile: I concur.

Barb|MyLilPseudonym: That is absolutely insane. In the good way.
i'm here for the chat only
GilDash: Agreed. Lets make one.
Nyananananyanana
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: FYI, I know nothing about farms, tractors or engines, so you'll be doing all the work. :p
We will name it Speedy.
MadSurge: there hasnt been a stream for a while so you didnt miss anything ^_^
It always Shizuka that starts the stream, I had just realised that.
wow
GilDash: Hah. Well it would be me throwing a bunch of money at some one who does know how.
looks like fun?
You can watch all you like :P
BladedWings: I know, I just miss the stream itself :D
Barb|MyLilPseudonym: Watching you throw money at a mechanic? Ought to be a laugh. :D
I would be upset when nothing happens right away.
How Long Did you guys wait for the stream???
Tantrum time would be in full swing.
You would have to calm me down, and explain that it always happens
IT would smooth things over.
13okay
GilDash: you working as a mechanic now?
13now i just need to acquire yakety sax

Barb|MyLilPseudonym: That's okay, I have to handle impatient people from time to time.

Shizuka is best driving instructor
Vehicular moshpit
It's like a monster truck derby.

This is getting funnier and funnier :D
Dat bus driving
Except with a bus, on the streets of a major city.

Did you just attain FLIGHT?
/me Stares at stream

Meanwhile: Magnets, how do they work?

CriticKitten: <-
Could this get anymore insane?

shizumobile: You craaaazy

This isn't Discord level now.
Was Discord here?
We've passed Discord lvel chaos
no it needs more suplexes
SpadeMagnes[School: I was going to say gravity, but that works.
where the firetruck?
Hmmm..
If it was Discord half the cars'd be made of chocolate milk.
o.o
I wonder if a different kind of fun could be had by modifying the friction something between this and normal, like -5 or something.
Who causes more chaos than Discord..
alexxm: oh yea brother :D
Hahahah
RAINING BUS
aniderp: Probably blown up.
The shopkeeper: A normal dy

WTF BOOOOOOOOOOOOM

You know, a pony mod of this game would be good. But if Rockstar were to import the entire system of the pony races into the engine, that would make the game even more awesome.
DESTROY US ALL
Is it possible for this to get any more insane?
Add a speech bubble that says "GRAAAAH"
There are no brakes on the Shizu Bus!
<--- What if cars has little gravity too? XD
I'm listening on repeat ''MY LEG! MY LEG!''
SpadeMagnes[School, possibly.
discord seal of approval
Alchemist, brakes depend on friction
:P
im gonna eat dinner quickly..
Its still going!
It's still saving
Shizuka: next objective: turn off gravity
EVEN IN DEATH THE BUS BOOOGIES DOWN\
Anyone have any good fanfic recommendations?
MLP_Brovakiin which joke you laughed at again?
Brakes? Pft, there's no friction or sense of gravity on the Shizubus. No need for such trivial things.
hold onnn i wanna see
Dark_Horst: No, keep it at around 0.05 or something, trust me on that. :P
DAT CAR
lol just another day in LC
It's cool that you can go through all that and then the hospital is like "Nah it's cool."
that might be even more fun
CriticKitten, there is gravity, just no friction
That car went through the building :D
all the pedestrians going on likenothing's goin on
Let's see if Shizu can run through downtown without getting hti XD
OOOONWAAARDS
merikaaaaa
That's a no.
DID HE USE CHEATS OR SOMETHING?
This game mode should be called tha gauntlet.
Sorry, caps..
Lol, "Hi car"
Kandarihu: Hard to tell. The cars are getting some absurd air
Does he use cheats?
Vordox: You spoke to soon :D
school sucks, drop out.
she
MLP_Brovakiin yeah, it's a better reaction than ''sorry''
No, he didn't use cheats. it's naturally like this. Definitely.
DinkyDoo: It's a she :P and yes
CARS CARS EVERYWHERE CARS
OMG I HEARD SOMEONE SAY ''MY LEG'' IN THE VIDEO!

out of the millions of registered people.
make a lots of police cars chase you :D
WHY YOU NO GIVE HER DAT?!
:D
Herr: This network doesn't log messages
Oddly enough it seems being in the middle of the street is safer than being near walls.
