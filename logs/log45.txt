We haven't decided yet.
13when i'm alone
10Ghosties I'll check again if it worked as soon as I'm done shooping something
0Ich, I think the idea of playing DNF at all, let alone on a console, just made me throw up in my mouth a bit.
4Alrighty
Are you guys going for the Summer Camp Sale Grand Prize?
10@rubenflonne i can only play FPS on 360 haha, I'm a scrubnub
Nah, way too much work to get all the tickets.
4What's the grand prize, Exscalibrony?
I just do the non-gaming ones
Mouse look is for nubs.
Its a pride thing...
but most xbox games get boring
4Ohhhhhhhh, neato!
4Unfortunately, I don't have any wishlisted games >.<
i liked DNF
it felt like old games
Oh! Yeah, I updated my wishlist for that.
10How hard is it to get?
No...
10the summer sale grand prize thing
I watch it on TV whenever it's on
I know there on there...but i refuse
Every ticket you get gives you an entry into the grand prize draw for the 10 games.
4It's what...every ticket is a drawing?
I dont get the Hub
13Lame
Where do you live?
Yeah, 100 grand prize winners

0Now now, one can like Modern Warfare 2 without being a moron, I'm sure plenty of intelligent people enjoy it... I don't know any mind you but the law of averages says there must be at least one.
4Dee_Twenty: I did
4I enjoyed MW2
To be honest I don't understand the quote you posted. XD
4I only play for the campaign
i liked the story
4Exactly
I USED to, and I'm a pretty clever pony
4I only play it for the story
MW1 was great. MW2 was eh...
13Fair enough
MW3 looks awesome
CoD4 campaign FTW
lol
I never played CoD
If anybody's interested.
I still didnt say i was going
13Still
:(
Oh the webs we weave
Looking forward to BF3 over MW3 personally.
Well?
I see people ask about them all day every day.
again getting sick of the FPS games
E3 made me cry
*nods*
derp
it was worse in person x3
0>Implying people read FAQ's.
0Wait, they allow the public into E3 now?
Nah i dont think i want to go back ever
no i used to work for konami
I wouldn't. I can't remember any of the commands. haha.
Half the functions don't even require them to type anything, they're built into mibbit.
10It's like the rules. We say it's mandatory that you read them. I read them the first time I came on here. I bet at least SOME of you haven't done though
0Ah, I was going to say, last I heard only the press was allowed.
Put it in between stream and shat.
10Widen the window even more? D:
You really want to know?
I read them
I read them first time I came.
there where a few good demos

No there not. But still, if i go back, ill be there for...more sentimental reasons

03no I don't
You don't have to read it, its just there for n00bs.
Dang
Heehee...
Pretty*
10n00b usually correlates with 'most likely to have problems' and 'least likely to read FAQ'
i liked the corporation though
I asked a few questions that weren't answered in the FAQ.
Do you at least still have the serial code for mIRC?
Like requests room, prvt messaging, and how to do the /me thing.
4I just got it the other day
or whatever it was. I still can't remember.
I won't ask
SEE!
:P
13I know...
10Polarfire, as I said requests room changes depending on which mod makes it. and also those things are things people should pick up eventually after 1 or 2 BMNs :P
but mod civ 5 is great
0Civ IV also had one of the greatest main menus of all time.
jk
Nah, worse
10It's just a lot of effort and one extra thing to mention in announcements and things, all for some newbs :P
13Shhhhh
10I didn't know, I lurked until I knew :D
drf?
10granted this was 3 weeks ago, still appropriate though
i need to find a civ 5 pony mod
4Well, as much as I'd like to talk Civ with you guys, I'm gonna play "Too Many Puppies" by Primus on Audiosurf, now
mmm. yeah. I guess, but i just find it annoying that you have to lurk to gain knowledge.
0You need to play some pony beats on Audiosurf. <3

Yeah...
Yes it was! I loved that night!

Just like applying for a job?
well, I know I was involved in the darkcynder22 incident

but the things you're talking about
those people are all gone
10I'm just interested, that's all >.<
I haven't seen them in at least a year
xD
13And then I did.
if not longer
Hi everyone!
I dunno. Most places usually have mods that have been around a little longer.
Hullo!
...really?
Have you seen this one yet?
13What happens if I decide to ignore Prince-Dari's automatic wanring?
I just got back from an amazing performance

and DEFNITELY not here

4Ah, thanks. I'M THE ELITE CHAMPION FOR TOO MANY PUPPIES ON AUDIOSURF :D

10@Dashite @Polarfire, the way I applied to be a mod (and I use the word carefully ;3) is important. The stream had an open BMN European-specific mod position to mod (primarily the saturday stream). I was never 'promoted' or anything. I applied for an open position and was interviewed.
I dont think i want to talk to her...
7lol
Really uncomfortable
as a mod I mean.
Same here
Totally understand that.
4RBD, don't divulge ANY information pertaining to the interview
Plus No-Script
Yeah I know I'm not critisizing you or anything dude its just surreal in a way
oh cool I finally finished my Deathstalker pony
0I wouldn't want the job anyway. Unless the pay is good, IS the pay good? :p
Seriously, you complain a lot.
he fucked over america
7That add-on annoys me.
Lol
10I had to impress people, and I thought I'd get stick for it at some point, here we are : /
...
13prince-dari: Oh you have no idea
10Roman500, link?
10I didn't
10did I?
4You did
http://zoidokl.deviantart.com/art/As-Quickly-As-Possible-V2-0-217447664
You dont want to know..
Not me
4Don't mention ANYTHING about the interviews
hmmm imageshack?
I don't care.
No one wants or needs to know...
hi
I dont really use da
10copy paste the inappropriate part
;p;
Just allow the right script
10sorry dude
There's nothing you could say to change my opinion.
which means I dont know how to use it...
10i really am, i swear none of that looked bad to me
dari
0Once again, proof of (pony) rule 34, if it exists, there is pony of it, including (regular) rule 34.
I'll tell you the breif summary of it
hey dari
Its not nothing
4That's why I didn't say anything about the actual content of the interview the night before
But it's only 1:30am...
the RP group said very disturbing things to and about him once
4We don't want people to have to "study" for the applications, we want to see them as they are with no hints
1:36 AM to be precise
but I can't say any more than that
12 36 here :D
We are internerds
13prince-dari: I'm somewhat part of this, and yes, it would be best if he didn't say
You can't take it seriously.
12ohai 365
10well I get that. and I thought i'd avoided it mostly. But looking back yeah shit i guess my wording was pretty dire
internerds are naturally night owls
no, not like that
I am an internerd... but its odd bc I'm not a gamer.
they are RPers
7http://hogia.deviantart.com/#/d3lgkmz
I am a night owl.
In otherwords, nothing but text.
10But on the other hand, you asked me a re-hash of the questions in the email
well with text, but yes
other words*
dari http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268668_1870244721827_1412375489_31690652_3700672_n.jpg
10and they're the only bits that I even partially mentioned
[06:36] You can't take it seriously.
Lugia365: i've been here since December2010 I think
4Even if they ARE just re-wordings or rehashes
Duuude
I've been on since... 2008 I believe, but just got back on
Dont try to assume dari, its not like that...
that's awesome!
13Normally I'd agree, but this is different
and tonight I got a backpack
It's just text. You don't even have to read it.
and I tried to include in the picture but couldn't but I got rarity and rainbow dash socks
Its not like that...at all
4You don't have to prove yourself to anybody
10yup

Well crap I'm just a barren wasteland for ideas today :(
I mean epic as in spine-tingling here by the way.

I'm no good at emulating existing characters. :/
I'm mad

But you gotta stay in character and have a REAL conversation... or whatever you want it to be.

I want to know you.

Bye bye
Good night

Enlighten me
Weird, I was just watching that
0Well I'm off, good night everyone!
Night :(
that's interesting. how many good RL friends do you have?
Currently? Carry the two... None.
:( that makes me sad
Wait, it's "mother hubbard"?
I thought it was "mother hoover". XD
Not me, I find the notion that physical proximity is important in any non-romantic relationship antiquated at best.
Woah man.
Where exactly does the antiquated fit into that sentence? Could you elucidate?
Yeah I don't get.
Is Dari asleep :P
Never.
Or lurking..
yep.
:P
Are you from the UK?
Yep.

11I had bananna pudding the other day.... Thought it would be gross but it was amazing.
On holiday I had a lot of things I'd never had before.
They had foods from all sorts of different countries.
It was really good.
Turning off the rainbow text now. XD
11Where did you go on.... wait for it... HOLIDAY!!!
13You Brits are weird, calling vacations holidays.
St Lucia. (:
11Pinkie pie face*
You Americans are weird, calling holidays 'vacations'. :P
11Are you like us pretty much?
11Dari?
13Insane.
11Are you like us? like.... I'm not sure how to say it... Are you like us XD
11foo
11:P
I dunno, America seems quite different from the UK.
We get a lot of things from America a while after they've had it.
11Are you guys in a shit ton of debt too?
11What do you mean? like movies?
13Cajun food>Any non-Italian European food, and most Asian foods too. <3
11Ah.
Halloween being a holiday here comes from America (though I don't treat it as such XD).
11I see.
11U guys watch the shuttle launch?
13And they call jelly jam, even though jelly is completely different from jam.
Is this recent news?
11today
11the last nasa shuttle took off from FL.
Lawl, you guys have jelly and jam the wrong way round.
13Don't watch the news, waste of time.
11I hate the news but that was something I wanted to see.
13Nuh uh, you call gelatin jelly, and you call both jelly and jam jam.
11It went 3200 mph!! :O
No we don't.
Jelly = http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/pe/personalised-jelly-mould.jpg
11U guys play an instrument?
Jam = http://images.mylot.com/userImages/images/postphotos/2353112.jpg
11I play the piano
11XD
13http://home.gwi.net/~spectrum/pbandj/pbj.jpg = Real jelly.
How is that jelly? It's not a gelatin food.
11JELLY JAM IT DOESNT MATTER!!!!!!!
7But I am a horrible singer.
11I pretend I can match pitch but I cant.
13It's not supposed to be gelatin, gelatin is gelatin.
11but I can try :D
Jelly = a gelatin dessert.
11I play both by ear I can't read music.
7I can only read music. /can't improvise or play by ear. :F
13Jelly = fruit juice and pectin creating a clear fruit spread. Jam = similar but contains both juice and pieces of fruit flesh.
11I pure improv everything pretty much. AND OMG GUYS!!! IT DOESN't MATTER!
Our definition of jelly and jam came before yours, in UK English ours is right. :P
11GAAAHHH
7I prefer preserves.
/me 7will be back?
11*2
11Cause they're arguing over nothing... Idk...
11I wanna know if they play anything.
7Or is it just a naive derogative?
I just don't like it when people tell me that UK English is wrong, at most you can say American English is equally right as UK English, but saying that UK English is wrong just makes no sense.
11UK AND AMERICAN ENGLISH IS RIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER!!
11Dari do you play anything?
13Your English is USUALLY correct, you're just silly about certain things like calling gelatin jelly and jelly jam. :p
11You guys need to learn something.
...
11I can play this:
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgZsGLlS1g
13I can call it silly though. :p
Why is it silly...?
13Because you have no way to differentiate between a jam and a jelly.
Yes we do...
11ugh
I told you.
11pretty much
11Oh well.
Jelly means this:
And only that.
Nothing else.
That's all jelly means.
We don't.
They aren't both jam.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6z3WXuzXXc
11OMFG GUYS!!!!!!!
The picture I posted before is jelly.
Just jelly.
Not jam.
Not jelly.
13Exactly, you call gelatin jelly instead of calling jelly jelly, you call jelly jam.
Just jam.
We call gelatin gelatin?
13There's no way to differentiate jam, which is a form of preserve, from jelly, which is made with fruit juice and pectin.
...
They are completely different words.
They mean completely different things.
They have nothing to do with each other.
11I can also play this
13Indeed, just like they're completely different products.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXUT9U8q2YM
They are completely different products.
11Sotha u there still?
They have two separate completely unrelated not linked words.
Jam - http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UIXOn06Pz70/SGaJFpoeJXI/AAAAAAAADsA/uE-FJbHUa7o/s800/Strawberry+and+Rhubarb+Jam+500.jpg
Jelly - http://www.jellybean88.com/wp-content/uploads/15_5_orig.jpg
It's that simple.
Those words are exclusive.
They aren't used for anything else.
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jelly
American jelly = UK jam. American jam = UK jelly.
11Night I guess guys.
Cya.
04o-o
13American Jam = UK Jam American Jelly = Still called jam in the UK.
11Is there anyone here on weekdays?
American jam = UK jam - WRONG
11...
13Describe jam then, made with fruit pieces, yes?
0Night D20 and Dari
Night.
13That's still called jam here, or sometimes preserves.
Wait, you guys have two words for the same thing?
lol
UK jelly = jell-o in America.
13Jam and preserves are sometimes used interchangably, but some people differentiate them by saying a preserve is a cooked and gelled WHOLE fruit or vegetable.
13Both contain actual pieces of fruit however.
UK English*
13Jelly by contrast only contains fruit JUICE and is solidified with pectin.
You eat jam with toast, jelly with a spoon.
'nuff said.
13You eat BOTH on toast in America.
Generally it's just mods and maybe a couple of lurkers at times other than streams.
13And I understand how both words are used in the UK, that's the problem, I can't go into a store in the UK and ask if they have any jelly in stock because they'd point me in the direction of the gelatin, I have to ask for jam instead.
ih
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jam Jam is jam.
That's the whole point.
If you ask them for jelly, they'd point you to jelly.
Gelatin desserts.
If you ask them for jam, they'd point you to jam.
XD
i was/bored
Not jelly.
If you want jelly, you ask for jelly.
If you want jam you ask for jam.
Orly now?
How can you not understand that?
13I don't want jam though, I want jelly, no fruit pieces, just gelled fruit JUICE.
13Read the listings in the preserves wiki for both jam and jelly, they're completely different.
7Good night as well.
13The mixture is then put into containers. The following extract from a US cookbook describes the process.
13See? Two completely different things, but there's no word to differentiate the two in the UK, they're both called jam.
I don't think you can buy American "jelly" in the UK.
We just have jam.
It's disgusting.
What's the point of it without the fruit?
The fruit is the whole point of jam.
13You get a completely different texture and taste.
Read more: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/In_British_English_what_is_the_difference_between_jam_and_jelly#ixzz1RaoDrqgm
"
7Ooh, activity. *shot*
13It's like the difference between a good steak and a hamburger.
13They're both beef, and they both taste good, but they don't taste the same and have very different textures.
7:D
Wait a second.
The American jelly and jello are the same thing.
7RAY :D
Lol Ray's still asleep XD
Bouncer xD
Nou
He leaves his IRC on at night
like me~
and kk
Lol, timezones
Well if you want to you can just buy jam without fruit pieces.
7back
7lol
Jello is essentially a type of jelly.
Wb
13Precisely.
4 mins?
7 3 minutes.
Right
7o.o
13Our method is far more efficient, jelly is much faster to say than "jam without the fruit pieces."
No one really cares.
7I'm known for eating slowly. XD
They just want jam.
apparently they had a C&C4
Also, looking at pictures of jelly, I see no discenable difference from jam.
discernable*

Its fun
13It's the lack of actual fruit pieces, it makes a huge difference in texture and taste.
Believe me xD
7It's hard D:
I've had jam without bits of fruit in it before.
13Jam tends to be a bit stronger tasting and chunky.
Ikr?
Heh

Personally I think it means that there'll probably be a season 3 and four.

yeah. Best Pony wants you to drink potion.
Nature's remedies?
I think
I think she only appeared in the one episode, but they've talked about her in a few others.
no, she's also in Swarm of the Century
for less than a minute, but she's there.
(she says "You're doomed!" as her last sentence in the episode)
oh wow, I gotta get back to writing my fic...
She does live in the everfree forest after all.
Depends on where in the forest they live.
It's never really mentioned.

6Vent here if you need to.
and as a mod, you're representing the entire team
6And let one of the other mods handle it if you get angry.
10Yeah. I personally felt like I wasn't doing too badly for the first 11 and a half hours xD but I completely understand. and it's a lesson that I ended up learning it a stupid way, instead of the sensible, gradual way
i like this medly the most
Req: Parabola (w/ Parabol).

Movie was terrible
Book was great, though

6I honestly feel bad for having left earlier than I usually do.
there was an animal farm movie?
ugh
one thing i get a lot is people saying the mods are all attention horses because we post in color and dont let anyone else
didn't finish watching van helsing either way too long
You don't wanna know...
6>>;
I have to read Animal Farm for school over the Summer.
and thats the kind of shit that comes with the territory
We already came to that conclusion before
PUT GUILES THEME ON
anythingception?
DO IT AGAIN I WASN'T HERE
6Maybe right before the mane stream.
0Elky: It's on my "Don't have, want to read" list with an assload of other books.

Magic, Hip?
:O
8RainBroDash is a full mod here
haha
unless...that means the world exploded twice!
TWICE?!?!
6We're already discussing it, Metal.
Reminds me of The Demented Cartoon Movie.
6We're waiting for more mods to get on.
We need to do this exact same thing with different GIFS, like Twilight clapping.
1 minute left!
"How many time did the world blow up now?" "I lost count"
0Dave_Brozilla: Exactly!
I'm still sorry ._.

6We wouldn't.
he needs to learn to stick around for more than a couple seconds
6He'd just be next in line.

6We won't need another streamer for a bit anyway.

6Also, brb, checking account.

spike giving a shit = 0

I just think Twilght saying "Spike, wake up it's Winter Wrap Up day!" Is fucking adoarble. I don't know why.
COLOUR
Watch how she loses the boots, saddle and scarf after the main theme
Bitch go back to sleep.

TWILIGHT VERSE IS BEST VERSE
10k

4Hmm
4Conflicting views
APPLE PONY IS BEST PONY
govva give it to ponies to randomly break out into song and know the words off by heart
Fluttershy verse is best verse
All verse is best verse.
:D
Rarity's part of Fluttershy's version is the best
Needs more Spike Verse.
all verse is best verse
Again, mod business stays mod buisness ;)
all verses are the best
...minus the kiss
that voice <3
10COLGATE >:3
lol
stupid emoticon
Singing Shy is adorable.
0Agressive Brush tactics, GO!
4Is Winter Wrap Up technically considered the "Christmas" ep?
Bad news, Caramel's gonna lose the grass seeds.
At least this song doesn't get stuck in my head too bad, Ducktails on the other hand....
10and yeah yeah i just
10bleugh
6Gummy pony is best pony.
I s'pose it could be
10K :D
IronPoptart: And it must be suitably epic.
spike is best pony
best part with rest for dramatic planting
Don't worry about it, just stay with the main room
Fluttershy is still best pony.
1
10It's spring!
Wow, is that still Tara Strong singing there?
see ya gaiz gotta go see ya next time hopefully
why can't twilight use magic?
meh, it should just stay a "Winter" episode, not put in any of those holidays
Luna is supposed to be in S2.
Oh look, Hipster_brony is mad today too!
Pretty much
Nope.avi, IronPoptart

Easy as Pinkie Pie.
This episode has an aggressive amount of plot.
Easy as a PINKIE pie! *rimshot*
mmm....Pie
pinkie is ice skating, this is helping winter why?
4CAJ: I didn't get the reference
10Razyn I think you got it right by getting it wrong?
8FACEICE
it helps becuase pinkie is skating
10It was Brawl, but probably referenced on there
acutally you guys have fun I'm just going to go to sleep since it's really early in the day
8this is my fetish
natural disaster
10ValtheJean then you win
*See's Pinkie skate for about 1-2 seconds*"You're the best skater I've ever seen!"
*Cough* MK9 *Cough
Well, you experienced it at least
I can clop to this
:D
Well, Spike is amused. Truely this was a victory for the forces of good.
I <3 natural disasters.
Thanks Spike...
4TGPFluttershy is doing it right. MK9 YEAH!
I heard that the majority of the pro community for SSB moved back to Melee
I don't blame Twilight, Ice skating for the first time is tough
dat window
that would hurt
6AAAAAAAAAAGH
6WINDOWS
I've always wondered if Twilight could use her telekinesis to make herself fly...
way to help the self esteem spike
*Cue adorable Fluttershy*
oh fail you are twilight
4WINDOWS ARE INVADING THE STREAM
lol, it's just his way of getting revenge for all the slave labor
Snaaaake!
are you ready?
Spike is only in this episode to make douchey quips at Twilight. That isn't to say Spike isn't awesome.
READY DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT
that is not cute at all
Am I still connected?
she may fail at some things but I still <3 Twilight
4Solid, balanced, good knockbacks and easy combos
