10We were all young at one point
/me runs
13I like being considered one of the youngest in a group of people
10^
13Unfortunately that rarely happens because I'm one of the oldest in my year group |D
10All my IRL friends are younger than me
10Not by years, but months and such
13^
12I look younger than I am =P
12I think
everyone I know is around 14-16
10Everyone thinks I look older ;-;

YAY.
13I wish I really could get people to give me Oreos on command
I had some Oreos as a snack today
I miss making scripts
I remember I made only one successful script with the help of Feather
13I don't know HOW to make scripts |D
I was just looking for some snack food from a vending machine that doesn't require getting your fingers dirty
and that was back when I was... 14?
And the Oreos were sitting there
Nice.
!oreos
13o-o
13Nah, I don't really have an interest in making scripts anyway :P
D:
whoa lag
Nooo
13Not even an ownership script, because I find it amusing when people try to claim me when they can't :3c
12how are they rare items if you sell the SAME THING all the time
lol dont you just hate it
when you are playing a game
then you lag.
and then everything comes at you at once
its like.. BAM.
12LOL that reminds me of a game on gaia called zOMG
02Yes.
brb food
12when the events start it LAGGGS
13Oh god LOL
13zOMG isn't as bad as it used to be though
12then all these attacks that you command, don't appear until like all in one ho
12go*
13in the past it used to freeze on my pc for like 10 mins
13then I'd hear a WHOOSH of all the sound effects happening at once

hm
I guess it's just mibbit sucking as usual then
as it wouldn't connect
12I'll test it on IRC real fast
You can test it wthiout going on IRC? Lawl.

I think he meant mIRC
Yeah.

12Yeah, it works
12I'm on it right now

you mean mIRC
LOL
You're still on ocean.
12Eh, nope won't work
odd
12I'll try again
Doesn't he/she know you can just open a new server window?
he's a guy
and apparently not
[23:53] * Unable to connect to server (Connection timed out)
yeah that's odd
I got a similar error
except mibbit just said "unable to connect"
but yeah]

I was playing this game earlier with some of my friends.
3i watched an "episode" of a series called Fatality on flipnote hatena
You drop MLP references (mainly names) in a channel of people who don't like MLP, and try not to let them catch on.
3i thought someone was re-drawing an actual series
3i googled it, found mortal kombat-related things
Hey, do you guys have a favourite kind of apple?
3and when i read the description on the flipnote
Hey who watches Gungrave?
3it said: this is an original series created by me
:D
3i'm like.............................oh
3GREEN APPLES RULE!!!!!!
Yeah, Granny Smiths.

03I may be putting too much thought into that though
i used to do shit w/o proxies, and i saw a good friend of mine get fucked for it
._.
I don't even try to hide anything, if someone searched through my computer for a couple seconds I'd be caught
What'd he/she do?
04So he had a good time for not using proxies?

but yeah my mum remarked today that she's started hearing "even weirder" shit from my room in the past few weeks
haha
I watched the first airing of MLP in the UK.
>mfw I realise that it's Ponies/BE A MAN/Nigel Thornberry/ITS FRIDAY NIGHT/ebrbrbrbrbrbr/every other bloody video we watch
DARI NO WHEN WAS IT
I MISSED IT?!
4th of July.
It was on CN yeah?
Boomerang
Family: andnotasinglefuck.jpg
I have sky, I was going to record it Q_Q
I was kind of disappointed.
6That's pretty awesome, RainBro.
yeah my mum would probably flip her shit
she's worried about me as it is
They didn't even say anything about it.
then again they knew I watched cartoons quite late in childhood
but this is MLP D:
6Show her I, Brony
6Best vid ever for getting the family on your side. =D
When we were younger my sister and I watched the powerpuff girls, and we've watched foster's home for imaginary friends before, so I'll probably convert her some time.
my sister and I were quite seperate during childhood
We used to argue a lot at a younger age, she was pretty miserable so she ended up taking it out on me, not that she meant to.
We get on really now though.
/me slaps Altair around with a pin
well I live with just my mum, but when my dad left I was 4, she was 8. So it rattled her even more than it did to me
wut
:(
Welp.
she'd already gotten really close with him, a real daddys girl, so when my mum pissed he off she just left the house and went to my dad's for some indeterminate amount of time, leaving me to deal with my mother on my own :P
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
!pokemon
^, you are a 8Spoink.
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT'S GOING ON NOW?
o-o
Ah.
but yeah we also fought quite a bit
then she moved out, and I was only 14, so we never really fixed the broken bonds and stuff. I mean we get on, but we don't live together, thus don't see each other

6yeah
6nah I'm not worried
6I'm starting off with an awesome roommate
6in an apartment, across the street from school
she was like "forget it,we'll call you your real name"
roommates don't help the classes not kill you
6I'm also done with all classes that arent a part of my major
6oh lol
http://i.imgur.com/BmohJ.png
/me runs
6oh god LOL
06O>o
How does that work?
I can't help myself
:P
/me giggles
and I'm so bored x.x
6so our power went out yesterday at about 5:30
6I was like great, too many people with the AC
LOL
6it'll be on in an hour, so I have an hour to do NOTHING
6I went to bed at 10, because the power never came on
6I NEVER go to bed that early
LOL
6about 6:30, I remembered I had youtube on my phone, so shut irc off and went to watch stuff
this is why generators ftw
6battery had 20 minutes left >.<
well
around here
if the power goes out in the winter
you freeze to death
as it can stay out for a week
6yeah we dont have that problem
so we got a $6500 generator
I'm like
if natural gas never goes out
6what our problem was was that it was a really hot day yesterday, and this is a senior park
6thank god the power went out in the late afternoon
why not run the power lines through those pipes LOL
6not the morning and through the day
o.o
isn't late afternoon hotter?
6around here, it cools off by 4
and I misread that as senior prank
:з / :З / :3 / :³ / є: / E: / :Э / Є: / :э
6LOL senior prank
6reminds me of when the class of '02 filled the school's pool with jello mix
6not nearly enough to get the desired result
LOL
6but enough to cause the school to drain it for the summer and half the school year
so wait, senior park? what's that o.o
6senior citizen park?
6a place where old people live
you live in a park?
6park as in trailer park
06bags
/me runs
6except it's not trailers
you live in a trailer?
6mobile homes yeah
LOL what
you live in a mobile home'
6I dont, my grandma does
*?
oh
you're visiting?
6yeah
6since it's an hour closer
oh
also LOL old people in trailers, that makes me laugh
6do they not have senior communities in your area?
6these are extremely common around here
they have nursing homes
06and graves
^ LOL
6literally, I can name 6 senior parks in a 15 mile radius
6and LOL
6WHY DID I LAUGH AT THAT
because it's funny?
06^
6it's horrible XD
Hi Kitten :)
06thats why it's funny
http://i.imgur.com/F0OBj.png http://i.imgur.com/RWXUG.png
:/
06O.o
yay taking screenshots?
06sometimes
6yeah going home early looks better
6as weird as it sounds
odd
6not really
6if you call in sick, your boss wouldn't even see you
6so you caould assume that instead of calling off sick, you went out of town
6at least leaving early, you show you've put in the effort to try
6and just can't do it
6as for counting against you
6leaving early counts against us at target, but HR will treat you like a person and understands those better than the day off
LOL
I just know you're allowed x sick days
6we don't have that
so I would use them if I had the/
m
6what we have is that if you get 5 marks within a month, you're on warning
6a 6th mark is a write up
6and 7th would be termination
marks?
6a mark is given if you're late by half an hour, leave early, or call off
hm
I dunno what kmart does
6I got put on warning because I had a fair mixture of those, but I'm not even sure how I got that "going home early" mark xD
LOL
6I do remember my half hour late mark, I thought my shift started at 7, not 6 x.x
6my leader called me like "you coming in today?"
LOL
06i'm working every morning in the vacation
06on the bright side
06my boss here is my dad :P
I'm not working
6I can't imagine working for my dad lol
but 7 hours of class a day is like X.X
6I mean, I'm not defiant or anything, I listen to him completely
6I just can not imagine listening to him FOR A JOB
06xD
06i work like 4-5 hours a day for him
06he owns a building contracters company
06and he needed extra hands
06and i needed some cash, so it's pretty even :3
6dude
6I saw a "Help Wanted" sign
6for the first time
6EVER
6at blockbuster o.o
LOL
that's what I call good job security
/me runs
inb4 help wanted in tearing the place down
6ironically enough, that blockbuster lost half its south wall to a drunk driver a couple months ago
6and still hasn't been fixed
6it's a wooden board right now :D
LOL
6it's funny though
6thats the wall that faces target, since we're across the lot from them
6we always walk out and laugh about it
you should paint it
or shoot paintballs at it
or something
6shooting paintballs could work
06paint a bullseye on it!
06more drunk drivers!
/me runs
6cuz that wall faces an open parking lot where no one parks
and be sure to paint "[aurora] was here"
/me hides
6I'll save that for the still undamaged wall
6I want the wood for target practice
LOL
owww my stomach is starting to hurt

Ah well, all are now downloaded
Blue is such a pansy.
trope#688 - Weighter cloths!
Fuck THIS IS HEAVY
lol
BRAVO
4The only correct answer is Final Fantasy X
0...aww
FFX was the last -.. .Yes.
0hatersgonnahate.gif
WHOA THIS IS HEAVY
loser
Bjornfot: LOL
Oh wait, he's green.
XIII was a great game.
ive never played any final fantasies
I must become stronger
green is laaaaaaaaaaaaaaame
0fuck, Ghosties, you're right. FFX is way better than both of those
heyheyheyheyhey
Refreshed Equestria Daily to check for Ponystalker
0Final Fantasy IX all the way.
lame
lol
sadly, FFX only gets good half way through
YEAH
0I smell Green
blackie chan!!!!!!!
9DAT BANDANA
karate kid!
My favourite Final Fantasy game is XIII!
FOR FREE
omg why must green dress like a tool ><
4Exactly, despite Tidus' horrible laughing, it was one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life
0FF13: Hey, let's make you walk a linear path for 20 hours, and then punish you with incredibly difficult encounters when you're finally allowed to explore
6FFVI was pure win
im having a hard time keeping up on the storyline
Why is he dressed like an 80s karate character?
Like a bauce
nono
Nice headband
FFIV
FFVI for always win
Eh, I played FFVI and didn't like it much. :Y Same with Chrono Trigger. Haters gonna hate. The only Square Enix game I've loved was The World Ends With You.
and IV was fun
0he wants to learn Kung Fu from a former red ranger
6FFIV was the best by far.
Oh god his teeth
0so he can be badass
0FFX: Tidus- the character you love to hate
bad teeth
tWEWY is good.
DEM TEETH
4What do the users think of Chrono Cross?
I'm sorry, but that guy looks like Captain Marvelous
That music reminds me of Iron Maiden.
0SirSprinkles I disagree. But in a nice way.
just sucks for the random guy at the end, and the dead people coming back to life
9PROTIP: Those words don't mean anything. They're pretty much onomatopoeias
no sirpsprinkles ff13 is best it has best graphiocs and is on ps3 lol
Fishface didn't like Chrono Trigger? How did he not get kicked yet?
Never played Chronocross
10also Icy seems to be ready for a pony
The World Ends With You is awesome, I should play it again some day.
0Ghosties I think it looks good, but I've only seen an LP
he looks like marvelous cause all red rangers look the same
10thanks to dari here
...
I'm a girl :UUUU
chat was just frozen for me for a second o.o
NAI!
Made even less sense in the movie.
NANI!*
But all red rangers are equally awesomest than the others
Protip: Don't use magnet powers against pointy implements.
9Jyan just loves talking in them
After one day of Training WE BECAME REALLY STRONG
Oh wow, I remember TWEWY
10yea
Uhhh

he's cumming.
0here's our antagonists
He is wearing a business suit, so it means that he is evil
The voice is enough for me.
10....

14Does gray even count as a colour?
10*Burned*
Again, only if he's willing to work. If only works when he has to, he's a tramp. If he never works, he's a bum.
0he works
Hmmm alright
Fuck da police
I dont think so
Gray is a shade.
Give me back my coin coke machine!
0Therefore, he's a hobo
Yes, this can only end well.

*pops up ghost on another tab to chat*
10(polarfire and anyone else who cares)
I bet he is a brony
and what made them take you in?
He is. XD
10They liked my application a lot?
Lack of empathy.
/me pushes Suinide down a well
lawl?
:(
Hmm. Interesting. I have waaaay too much stuff to do friday nights IRL to ever want to be a mod.
13:3
Heh heh, "interview" is that what you kids call it these days? Wink wink, nudge nudge, say no more, say no more. :p
10Y U SO LAWL?

/me throws suinide a rope

GASP
10is it on friday?
While being a mod would be cool, I rather stay a citizen. Besides, the color I would want is taken by Sprinkles ;_;
*climbs*
hold on i got a flamethrower for that
I mean Suinide
13The square root of rope is string...
why would i be mad?
:/ hey now
and the circumference of cupcakes is rainbows
I'd love to be able to post in pink text, but I dislike having authority.
/me 10wanted Silverscreen's colour most :P
15Gray colour is best colour.
Fuck im high, lets make cupcakes
13Pi?
[11:37.26] <Suinide> why would i be mad? <- because you used to not like anybody saing your words

Kick him again!
You a brony Suinide?
blak colour is best.
red was taken so i would do black to confuse people xD
4Is the guy still around?
...mayyyyyyybe
I doubt it
10@Dee_Twenty I know right, I spent about 6 days thinking back and forth if I should even apply or not...
Oh! Oh! Pick me! I have a lack of empathy and quick kicking reflex too!
He is.
Yes
:O

He knows a picture.
*sets up a chair to watch the kicking*

10Loooool
Big Mac is BEST mac.
13Nummy

Partially busy right now, but I might in a bit.
0I remember the good old days when there was no internet and everypony programmed in machine code.
4Sol: I had the demo for Amnesia, but it's a single player game if I recall
0Dee_Twenty thinks the mods suddenly sound like an infomercial, expects somepony to say "And much much more!" any time now.
blarg
Ghosties get's points for Uplink.
10oh, you dashite :> you so random
ACTIVISION
dammiy
DOS for win
:D
15 minutes until internet goes off
D:
Hey Dashite, you wouldn't have happened to get your name from a certain fanfic would you?
0>DOS
13:L
I did.
0Dos is far too high-level.
10Dee_Twenty ->"AND IF YOU JOIN NOW, YOU GET A SPECIAL GIFT PASS TO ANY STEAM GAME OF YOUR CHOICE!"
And finally, growing up with DOS comes in handy for something!
Sorry, I can't brain tonight X( Yeah, I meant TF2 (don't know how I messed that up...)
4Hell yeah, Uplink was a game from my childhood
/me signs up right this minute!
4I used to play it day in and day out

I dont know where it is, besides im not touching it
blame my parents
then use the non evil one you are touching
0i think i'm already int eh steam group...
HAH! I just finnished it yesterday, I've been playing New Vegas all day because of the Fallout crossover.
I'm 20 and they still limit my internet
cd C:\Games\commanderkeen.exe
I'm not really a gamer...
4And yes, at some point, I do plan on creating a server for BMN steam group on TF2
I don't even have steam.
Should reset the router and set your own password.
And I screwed that up...
i would be glad to help as always ghostie
her dad would not be pleased
not one bit
I would, but I think I would be murdered
Or my computers would, at least
4Much appreciated, rubenflonne
Imma die every two seconds, for In00b at multi-player games
4I'll think of you when I run into trouble :P
10Sol In00b more, seriously
x3
10In00b SO hard.
that's your specialty
0Sol: You can't possibly suck as hard as I do at TF2. Not only am I not big on multi-player, I generally HATE FPS.
I bet I n00b more.
Exscalibrony Nice! I've been following since about chapter 14.
Well im afraid i cant do something to a router miles away
I BET YOU ANYTHING.
0We should get together and see who sucks most!
Me.
I have a grand total of 10 minutes of TF2 playtime.
10Dee_Twenty FINALLY understands why we have a steam group..
10NOW JOIN
Then, wealln00btogether? Yay!

BEST. SONG. EVER!
*sorround

7XD
I plug it into my sorround sound every single time I'm home alone
*surround
4Speaking of FREE GAMES, RainBroDash, did you ever try Killing Floor?
:P
0I die a lot more against bots with Dead Ringer, needless to say I don't think that applies to me. XD
you'll have to remind me next time
i can only play FPS on PC
unless its duke
What's playing next week?
some reason i can play consle with him
13I watch my little pony on the 3d tv in my grandparents living room...
We haven't decided yet.
13when i'm alone
10Ghosties I'll check again if it worked as soon as I'm done shooping something
/me is no longer closet brony. :P
0Ich, I think the idea of playing DNF at all, let alone on a console, just made me throw up in my mouth a bit.
4Alrighty
Are you guys going for the Summer Camp Sale Grand Prize?
10@rubenflonne i can only play FPS on 360 haha, I'm a scrubnub
Nah, way too much work to get all the tickets.
i grew up on FPS for PC x3
13I told all the little kids at my church I love my little pony... :3
I tried to download the whole HD season on itunes but my comp sucka and i cant get them on my phone, so i refuse to watch them until i get them that way.
4What's the grand prize, Exscalibrony?
I just do the non-gaming ones
thats why i portted a xbox on my PC
Mouse look is for nubs.
Its a pride thing...
but most xbox games get boring
the top 10 games on your wishlist free
0Has no clue what Exscalibrony is talking about.
4Ohhhhhhhh, neato!
13Pwease watch em Suinide? :<
4Unfortunately, I don't have any wishlisted games >.<
i liked DNF
it felt like old games
Oh! Yeah, I updated my wishlist for that.
10How hard is it to get?
not like the shit storm today
youtube
it's what I did
4How hard is what, RBD?
No...
heya Zephyr
I didn't either Ghosties, just added some
10the summer sale grand prize thing
I watch it on TV whenever it's on
I know there on there...but i refuse
Every ticket you get gives you an entry into the grand prize draw for the 10 games.
4It's what...every ticket is a drawing?
I dont get the Hub
13Lame
Where do you live?
4Yeah, what Dashite said
Yeah, 100 grand prize winners
10oh i see
oh fuck
0That's precisely the problem though, it feels like you're paying $60 for a 12 year old game.
I forgot about that sale
4TOO BAD I WON'T GET DRAWN LOL
7hi
10TOO BAD I WHILE LOL
Whos dari talking to
ughhh oh well I got som egames out of it
10WHILE
10WOW
You.
10I CANT ENGLISH
4Very nice, RBD
I know where everyone else lives. :P
10hawkward
4You're English, and can't even type it properly
RainBroDash can't brain tonight. He has the dumb.
Lol creeper
4Fail, sir
http://i.imgur.com/aKe2I.gif
10what Dashite said, it be true.
/me slaps Drake
:3
0For the price of DNF I could put a preorder for ME3 instead.
lol elision
(suddenly, Elision with a .gif)
Oklahoma. I get it, but i dont have it on my package, even if i did i still wouldnt watch it, i refuse
4Dee_Twenty
04wat
10Elision you make me giggle :3
4What's the problem?
Satelite package*
blah ME3
For the price I paid for DNF I could have bought two games.
are there any ghosties around?
i am enjoy it
and normally i am picky about my game
games**
Heya Arma, everyone
Also, gamestop can go to hell for not having any copies of PS3 Vanquish today.
fucking all E3 was shit storm
7o.o
10nopEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
7hi
only handful i am looking forward to
$10 sale and not a single PS3 copy in town. :/
0The price of Duke Nukem Forever is just too unreasonable, charging full price for a 12 year old game? Fuck that noise.
disgaea 4
4Well, it JUST came out though
Wait Suinide, so are you a brony or not? :P
0The game's worth $20, MAYBE $30.
i got balls of steel for 70 bucks
worth it
4It didn't get a real new makeover until Gearbox got a hold of it, and that was like a year and a half ago or so
the only person here who I don't know their location is icy
Im a brony, im just to pissed to watch them
Icy is a brit, right?
LO NO
LOL*
right
I still need to finish DNF though. I got sidetracked by Dungeon Siege 3 and Frozen Synapse.
Florida or something.
LO NO
ah, he strikes me as british for some reason'
LO AND BEHOLD NO
i kinda got went right
Haven't finished those yet either.
when my D&D session
i still need to pick up DNF again
10Seriously dude, i cant see that pass anywhere
10ghosties
4Hmm
crap, one minute
4I'll look again
0DNF is pretty good... for being 12 years old
Nooo
so I totally forgot Ghosties was in here when I said that
true story
I left off at the Duke Burger level.
Sorry, Duke just can't live up to the hype
0Just because it just came out doesn't justify charging the same price for it as for a new, modern game, especially when it feels all around unpolished.
i left off after his dream
we
must
hold
this line
Gah
incepetion
9he's still around but I told him it'd be better to talk so tomorrow
9btw Ghostier
9in the steam group
I don't think you can go any deeper in DNF. It's too shallow.
9are you the only one allowed to post announcements?
4QUESTION
ANSWER
0I agree, it's a pretty good game, in it's own right, it's just not worth the price tag.
We lost her
she disconnected from Gmail
D:
we have failed
thats why i knocked off my price
/me contiunes to idle.
4Does anyone here know if it's possible to send a Guest Pass to a friend from a game they bought if they didn't send it upon getting the passes to give?
thanks to my friends that work at game places
*dies*
4Yes
70 bucks for balls of steel
worth the price
o-o
Alas, we have lost two in the battle today
04Ok
Drake ,3
<3
how are you, Zephyr?
04I'm gonna have a break from reading Spyro FFs
Depends on if the pass has an expiration date I'd think.
okay
/me hugs Drake
/me goes to write Reminiscence
04HOW MANY CHAPTERS HAS THIS GUY WRITTEN
0I'd just as soon spend that $70 on pony merch.
9I see
9I was wondering if other administrators could do so
04We're almost to the 100 chapter mark. And it's only Book 2 of 3
4You guys are officers
04Admittedly, each chapter is only around 1000 words.
04But still.
Hey guys, have any of you seen my declaration of war on the non-bronies of spyroforum?

0Unless by art you mean writing or baking I doubt I'll be much help.
04Yeah
4DUDE
4DO IT
I never see you post anymore
Check your guest passes.
04I could beat that in a single book of about 20 chapters.
I don't know how much Reminiscence has
/me runs
04NS
4I don't know how
9real friends won't give a damn dude
04I'm pretty sure
4I'm sure I sent them off
7.-.
10No offense to you guys, i love you and my friends would too. But every single one I tell about the ponies flips their shit at me
04Reminiscence beats it
9at most they'll tease you
In the steam client.
XD
I'm doing pretty well, you? Sorry for the late responses, I'm always multitasking haha
13sometimes i do
don't worry Zephyr XD
`.`
4Just ignore 'em
It's under the games menu. Manage guest passes.
heh Drake
9well, y'know
Reminiscence's early chapters are short
I dont...and i dont think i should
gift and guest passes*
9it's one thing trying to get 'em into ponies
04As is everyone's
13You can...
10It's just difficult, being a WoW-nerd turned socialite dude. I've done my best to make a name for myself being NORMAL
derp
04But you make up for it in a 16000+ chapter
Why?
10and now, ponies.
4AH, thanks Dashite!
16510
No problem.
9well dude, it's your call
9but remember
Should i?
No...
13Yes
13Do it
4Oh, and RBD, I just resent the guest pass
9"nobody in this world is normal. that word is but an illusion"
4My manager says I did send it to you, but I resent it just to be sure
10Ghosties, just got it, installan
7@_#
4Niiiiiiiiiiiiiice
Do eet
4We should totally get on, DCD should join us
10NewDCD I know right, and I pride myself on being loopy. But shit like being a basement dweller just means you dont get invited out, ever
Hmm, 3 Deus Ex, 1 Frozen Synapse and 1 HL2:EP1 copies left to give away.
What if i see...one of them...
10being thought of as a basement dweller*
4Dude, you look NOTHING like a "basement dweller"
So is streaming done for tonight:(
Yup.
10I was one :D
Call me oatmeal, but how in the world do you get multiples of the same game?
I don't live in a basement, I live in my room. :>
4You're too pretty to be one :3
10I've changed, but people still warn me that I'm 'refluxing'
9Rainbro I'll play with you tomorrow in Killing Floo'
10>:33333333
crap now what a I gonna do until the wee hours of the morning.
10DCD if my PC can deal with it for sure
9just gimme a ring when you see me online
Then you eat them.
huh?
9I believe it will
Whole.
I'm annoying people on Black Ops
9you can run TF?
10and Dari same, but they like the phrase :L
4DCD, you and me and RainBro should do some Killing Floor tomorrow
10just about...
9you WILL run KF fo'sho'
You should read...something...
Like the Dresden Files
7:<
Ponies/Battletech crossover.
4Dashite, give me the Deus Ex
I am a cannibal...
Whats that?
Play TF2?
4pleeeeeeeease
9also you got me on Steam right, Rainbro?
10every time i read the steam button that says 'FINISH' I assume it says 'FINISH HIM' and smile, then realise it doesn't and I sad.
In case you guys didnt know :3
04._.
10nawh dcd i dont think i do as yet
Should I get MLP stickers for the mountains, or just tape some printed pictures to the top?
I'm not a gamer.
Why didn't you buy it when it was on sale the other day? :(
10whatever you can do, as long as it's poni
13Suinide: oo wont
4But Dashite, why would I when you have 3 copies left to give?
10both :D
holy shit
im back
some fag
called me stupid
How do you know?
Because I was planning to raffle them off to celebrate the release of Human Revolution?
John lennon write us a song back in the 60's.
4D:
10bonus points for getting merch and posing them in sexually oriented positions on top of mountains..
4But that's...that's just
bet you guys didn't know.
13I made sure they wouldn't some back
what song is that
I kinda wish it was a 10 pack and not an 8 pack now.
I Dig a Pony
oh hah
How?
Hahaha, I don't know if I can get any from the UK.
I wanna see if someone out there is hardcore enough to know it.
*Dig a Pony
7o.o
/me cries to Drake
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agZnntFenRk&feature=related
Sol! holdin out on me! haha
04wat
OH MAH GAWD
HE CALLED ME STUPID
I cant watch that, so i hope it was for someone else
oh, I'm still here
13i know
[12:05.52] <Suinide> What if i see...one of them... "They" are all gone by now, trust me
10yeah ikr, and all the ebay international sellers for the RBD blind bag toys are like 15 quid :S
4Oh well, I guess I'll just leave the stream empty handed *plays harmonica, skips rocks down the road*
<- Beatles nerd
10I've checked ;)
hey dash when your done with your game would you want to try the online?
for anyone thats interested...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG_E1t-Lr0c
unless you don't have the PS3 one
9anyways you guys

I, hye hye hyye, hyye hyyyyyye dig a moondog

9I must bid thee adieu
I can play about 5 of there songs on piano.
or at least I haven't seen any of them in a damn long time
...
10DCD
10whats your steam?
But I also like lennon's solo stuff.
Who are you referring to as "them@
"*
if you mean the people I think you do
Vulcan and crew
he was a genius.
Hah.
Yeah, I heard MP was pretty meh.
9New DCD
I have it on PC though.
9shocking, I know XD
Mods kick mods... INECPTION
What about nintendo freak
9anyways
9g'nite
Lennon actually called Dig a pony crap himself.
4See you later mang
10I searched that! D:
i think we could still play with eachother dash
him I like, but I haven't seen him either
10ill find it on the steam page for BMn, night dude
I love it, its one mf my fav's.
Polarus: He was a genius
4It's probably "NewDCD"
4no space
Who's evryones favorite mane and background pony?
I dont want to if hes there
also thats listening to morons who like MW2
*Polarfire, sorry, can
MP
Fluttershy and Derpy here
't brain
lmao
10>finding on the BMN steam page either way
fluttershy and doctor whoofs
13Nah, he's gone
np.
You've got three guess for mane and the good Doctor for background.
How do you know? Im not going if hes there
I've been called polarflare repeatedly by somebody... haha
Can't remember who.
why.... hallo there
0Now now, one can like Modern Warfare 2 without being a moron, I'm sure plenty of intelligent people enjoy it... I don't know any mind you but the law of averages says there must be at least one.
4Dee_Twenty: I did
4I enjoyed MW2
To be honest I don't understand the quote you posted. XD
4I only play for the campaign
i liked the story
it was to short
4Exactly
I USED to, and I'm a pretty clever pony
If i do, and he shows up once, somehow, someway, im gone again
4I only play it for the story
MW1 was great. MW2 was eh...
13Fair enough
MW3 looks awesome
0So in other words, Ghosties plays MW2 for the "plot." Bweh heh heh.
Now that chat has calmed down a bit I have an idea for mods...
CoD4 campaign FTW
lol
I never played CoD
Its pretty simple but would save time.
If anybody's interested.
I still didnt say i was going
13Still
:(
Oh the webs we weave
Looking forward to BF3 over MW3 personally.
Well?
0I'll stick to Mass Effect for my shooting needs.
Polarfire: What's your idea?
Why not make a page that lists all the mibbit commands. Like private message, and all that other crap I can't remember right now. And all the rooms also. Requests, etc.
I see people ask about them all day every day.
again getting sick of the FPS games
E3 made me cry
*nods*
derp
it was worse in person x3
0>Implying people read FAQ's.
10So, like a troubleshooting page? The problem with that is that people will STILL ask the same question, just having not read that page.
0Wait, they allow the public into E3 now?
Nah i dont think i want to go back ever
may I ask what nesslock is?
no i used to work for konami
I wouldn't. I can't remember any of the commands. haha.
Half the functions don't even require them to type anything, they're built into mibbit.
10It's like the rules. We say it's mandatory that you read them. I read them the first time I came on here. I bet at least SOME of you haven't done though
0Ah, I was going to say, last I heard only the press was allowed.
E3 got me NHL12, Uncharted 3, BF3 and DE:HR for $20 off each title so E3 wins this year.
Put it in between stream and shat.
FAQ READ FOR CHAT COMMANDS in big bold letters.
10Widen the window even more? D:
You really want to know?
10RULES is in big capslock :P
or below chat.
I read them
10Good, Sol. Have a cookie :D
I read them when I was bored. :/
4Yes, Dashite. I play MW for the "plot"
I read them first time I came.
there where a few good demos
but damn it, no more remakes
no more sequals
/me noms
no more FUCKING FPS!!!
4Wait
dari: maybe not :P
4That was to Dee_Twenty
Yeah.
I know all of them :(
Also, can I get a good C&C again?
0Pft, even if you made it so you had to read the FAQ every time they came to the page people would just scroll through it without reading it and click "I have read bla bla blee bla."
13Shh
13k
What about someone named sympony? Synthony?
Something like that
Nobody leiks me idea:(
a C&C would be nice to see again
7lol
13He never came back
They could call it C&C4.
/me 4is now playing AudioSurf
7hi
It's been a while
7XD
A FAQ every time you have to visit the site would also be annoying, especially for us people who strictly use mibbit
Hey
lol
7cake. XD
i feel like playing civ V tonight at some point
lol
10rubenflonne, implying there's been a good C&C since Westwood stopped ruling over the creation?
but having to much fun with you bronies
does drf have the mIRC for windows 7 yet?
this ist rue
C&C3 wasn't too bad.
because I may need it
0Oh I like it, I'm just saying it would only really stop people from asking the same questions over and over who would most likely google the question rather than ask it anyway.
/me 7shrugs
10ruben dude we need to play some RTS sometime buddy
0Ew. Civ V.
No there not. But still, if i go back, ill be there for...more sentimental reasons
7My elbow itches. .-.
RA3 suffered from the co-op focus.
Well I just see people ask the same questions aaaaaalllll the time and if I was a mod I would get mad
10Empire Earth or something xD
Also, I have a new computer
but she's not evil or anything
03no I don't
i enjoy civ. V
I have a purpose if i go there now, and im oretty sure i wouldnt be fufilled
You don't have to read it, its just there for n00bs.
Dang
10Polarfire, it gets annoying, but these people are usually the ones who are a bit silly in the head. and they are also the least likely to read an FAQ. As rude as that is, it's kinda true :S
Im evil, you dont even want to know what ive been doing since i left...
i hated the religion because of the stupid, oh hey you going to do free religion but all of your groups are converted its rendered useless
Heehee...
Pretty*
10n00b usually correlates with 'most likely to have problems' and 'least likely to read FAQ'
i liked the corporation though
I asked a few questions that weren't answered in the FAQ.
Civ4 vs Civ5 is irrelevant because Alpha Centauri is still the best Civ game.
10grats :D that's why I mean it's a general idea
0Civ IV was better, Civ V feels like a step backwards instead of forwards. If you have a good idea that's poorly implemented in a game, like religion, don't just cut it out entirely, fix it.
4Civ IV is a fun game
Do you at least still have the serial code for mIRC?
still need to play alpha
Like requests room, prvt messaging, and how to do the /me thing.
4I just got it the other day
or whatever it was. I still can't remember.
I won't ask
SEE!
Civ V vanilla > Civ 4 vanilla. Civ 4 Beyond the Sword > Civ V
:P
13I know...
10Polarfire, as I said requests room changes depending on which mod makes it. and also those things are things people should pick up eventually after 1 or 2 BMNs :P
lol true dash
but mod civ 5 is great
I assume it's along the lines of smashing small children's lego sets or something
0Civ IV also had one of the greatest main menus of all time.
jk
Nah, worse
That too. I don't know if it's possible for them to top Baba Yetu.
10It's just a lot of effort and one extra thing to mention in announcements and things, all for some newbs :P
13Shhhhh
10I didn't know, I lurked until I knew :D
:( but im remebering even more now since ive come back icy
drf?
10granted this was 3 weeks ago, still appropriate though
i need to find a civ 5 pony mod
4Well, as much as I'd like to talk Civ with you guys, I'm gonna play "Too Many Puppies" by Primus on Audiosurf, now
10hf Ghosties
Later Ghosties!
mmm. yeah. I guess, but i just find it annoying that you have to lurk to gain knowledge.
FSU, Ghosties
0You need to play some pony beats on Audiosurf. <3
13Forget it all, everythings gonna be ok
I've been playing pony songs in Beat Hazard.
try to remember the good times
And asking questions gets old
0I bet Pinkie's Lie kicks your ass in games like them.
Trying to give myself seizures. I don't think there is any other reason to play Beat Hazard.
I dont know
Soo many flashing lights...
10Polarfire most communities are like that >:3 trust me, I'd love to only cater for people who didn't ask questions, and didn't cause trouble... But then I'd be out of a job
like when you gave us all cookies when we bowed and we declared you the pope
RainBroDash: how long have you been watching BMN?
hey dari
Heh...those were good times...
you know the sims?
10 6 BMNs in a row not including tonight
Yeah.
10so 3 weeks
http://i.imgur.com/0Tjx0.jpg
What's your favorite Civ V quote? Mine's "Build additional pylons?"
14Grey Text
made that last night
LOL
Wow you made it to mod quick.
AWESOME
RainBroDash has been here less time than I have?!
I mean
But the bad...outwiegh them by a lot
0I only missed the first movie night.
This is my 2nd friday.
I have it
PM me
10What's the implication of me being here less time than you? Just wondering guys.. Explain?
kk
I've been here about three weeks as well. Aladdin and Starship Troopers?
I haven't missed movie night yet!
10Yep sol. was a great night
13I forgave you so... screw the rest?
0Though I slept through much of last week's.
13<-- Modded on the 2nd BMN
Yeah...
Yes it was! I loved that night!
night all
7night
But i stil dont want to see them
That was an awesome movie night.
I might cry
Or kill them
13That night made Starship Troopers 20% cooler
0Austin Powers = Instant sleeping pill.
Most of the bad times were involving people who are not here anymore
10>Bronypeanut posting after stream, with no mod duties. >not posting as flutterpeanut......
13Exactly
What are the criteria for becoming a mod?
But not all?
13hm
The Mario movie was either my first or second movie night.
I have way too many things that take up friday nights IRL to ever take care of any mod duties I would have.
10@Dashite, @Polarfire. I'm still wondering why you're so astounded I've been here a short time, what gives? D:
13Wat
13OH
Just like applying for a job?
:P
Oh sorry I didn't know that was directed at me.
but the bad aspect of that incident is the person who's gone
10lol'd^
Not her...
:D
but the things you're talking about
those people are all gone
10I'm just interested, that's all >.<
I haven't seen them in at least a year
xD
13And then I did.
if not longer
Hi everyone!
10wb peanut
10HI BANE
I dunno. Most places usually have mods that have been around a little longer.
/me 7sits on Cube again
Hey Bane!
Hullo!
...really?
I can indeed
Have you seen this one yet?
I just got back from an amazing performance
Hmm.
4Sol
10you get kicked i think
and yes really, for one thing I haven't even been to spyrochat in less than a year
13TESTING THE THIRD WARNING
0You must cross the burning desert of despair, traverse the treacherous forest of festering fear, swim the raging sea of sorrow, and retrieve from the top of mount misery the great and powerful banhammer of banality which is guarded by the dragons of DOOOOOOM! to be a mod.
but for another thing they are definitely not on the forum anymore
10Ah I seeee. Well Dashite the thing is I wasn't plucked out of the group of viewers as if to say 'you're the best one RBD, you be a mod' dude
and DEFNITELY not here
Well its just you've only been here a short time and last time I talked to you you weren't a mod and I remember you asking me for advice on what cutie mark for your character... AND NOW your all *Mod *Kick *Ban and stuff.
nuff saud
Ghosties, yes?
said
After the first time it kicks you it doesn't do it again.
0Lolk
I have no friends there
4What does FSU mean?
/me sits on Ray's head :3
Ill be all alone
13Wait really?
13Oh. It doesn't.
FSU = Fuck shit up
/me gets crushed
if you mean the forum, I'm there
;; I'm not that big
4Ah, thanks. I'M THE ELITE CHAMPION FOR TOO MANY PUPPIES ON AUDIOSURF :D
Icy is sometimes there
13I can't put hearts in my name
13:(
lol
yeah, she is still around
13mmhmm
02yesh, you are
/me 7runs
0I bet that's because nopony else PLAYS that song. :p
Icys gonna need to be there always
I don't think I have any elite championships left.
i need to get audio surf at some point
13Be where?
Spyro forums
me isnt Ray
4And Dee_Twenty: Nice alliteration in that wall o text there :P
The only time I ever see you Icy is in Spam
:P
I might still have the lead on Samus vs Rundas from MP3.
4Actually a few people have played Too Many Puppies
I see you FSU'd, good on ya
then again, that's where I do most of my posting too
4But no one's played it on Elite yet :)
Its like taking a job and being promoted a lot faster than someone who has been there longer.
x3
Nothing wrong with it, its just surreral in a way.
Jackie Chan so badass.
4Well, like I said, Sol, no one's played it on Elite yet :P
What polarfire said.
oh hey
on Gmail
0Alliteration always makes me merry. :p
not IRC though
Hm.
4DAT ALLITERATION
Now you could kick me if you wanted...
4AAMMM
HHHHNNNNGGGGG
10@Dashite @Polarfire, the way I applied to be a mod (and I use the word carefully ;3) is important. The stream had an open BMN European-specific mod position to mod (primarily the saturday stream). I was never 'promoted' or anything. I applied for an open position and was interviewed.
I dont think i want to talk to her...
I think part of it is that I still kinda consider myself as being new to BMN and seeing someone who's been here an even shorter period of time is just odd.
7lol
Not gonna lie im uncomfortable now
Really uncomfortable
yay i has AdBlocker Plus nao
as a mod I mean.
4Guys, point is that RBD applied for the position and got it
Same here
Totally understand that.
4RBD, don't divulge ANY information pertaining to the interview
Plus No-Script
Yeah I know I'm not critisizing you or anything dude its just surreal in a way
oh cool I finally finished my Deathstalker pony
0I wouldn't want the job anyway. Unless the pay is good, IS the pay good? :p
10The great thing about this is that it shows that I was picked for my ability to do good for the stream, based on an interview which showed my traits, talked about past experiences in modding, etc. I was never 'picked'... I 'made the cut' through what was a difficult process
there was a texis person in the white house
Seriously, you complain a lot.
7That add-on annoys me.
Lol
10I had to impress people, and I thought I'd get stick for it at some point, here we are : /
Why are you so bothered about certain people being on?
...
4RainBroDash, mod chat. Now
It doesn't really surprise me. Becoming a mod on a chat is not the same as becoming a manager of a store
10Roman500, link?
10I didn't
10did I?
4You did
You dont want to know..
Not me
4Don't mention ANYTHING about the interviews
hmmm imageshack?
We still <3 you RainBroDash. :)
I don't care.
No one wants or needs to know...
hi
4All that: the questions and what not
Thankfully i remix :D I havent laughed this new version is Space. SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE! <--- LMAO a mix of my random tweets XD\
I dont really use da
10copy paste the inappropriate part
;p;
Just allow the right script
10sorry dude
There's nothing you could say to change my opinion.
You're making a big deal of nothing.
which means I dont know how to use it...
10i really am, i swear none of that looked bad to me
4Seriously dude, that shit stays private
dari
0Once again, proof of (pony) rule 34, if it exists, there is pony of it, including (regular) rule 34.
I'll tell you the breif summary of it
Somebody should get some sleep chat is still kinda crowded
hey dari
Its not nothing
4That's why I didn't say anything about the actual content of the interview the night before
But it's only 1:30am...
dari do you wanna see all the mlp merchandise I got last night
the RP group said very disturbing things to and about him once
4We don't want people to have to "study" for the applications, we want to see them as they are with no hints
1:36 AM to be precise
Is he new or something?
Hell yes.
but I can't say any more than that
12 36 here :D
We are internerds
It's the internet, people say stuff.
You can't take it seriously.
12ohai 365
10well I get that. and I thought i'd avoided it mostly. But looking back yeah shit i guess my wording was pretty dire
0Damn this Lupin torrent is taking forever.
internerds are naturally night owls
no, not like that
I am an internerd... but its odd bc I'm not a gamer.
7ohai LL
they are RPers
Hey LL
meaning when they say stuff
I am a night owl.
they did stuff
Did stuff, over the internet?
I probably won't be on really late tonight. Too many early mornings this week.
ghost is so funny
*Content Sigh* I love brony chatrooms
In otherwords, nothing but text.
10But on the other hand, you asked me a re-hash of the questions in the email
well with text, but yes
other words*
dari http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268668_1870244721827_1412375489_31690652_3700672_n.jpg
0Three days and only the first two episodes are done.
He didn't even have to read what they said.
Crud, I forgot this chat's server ^^;
10and they're the only bits that I even partially mentioned
[06:36] It's the internet, people say stuff.
[06:36] You can't take it seriously.
4Again, we don't want anyone to know what goes on in the interviews
icy is pink he is feelin sassy
I see what you mean, but it made him really uncomfortable being here
4Even if they ARE just re-wordings or rehashes
Steam chat, this one, Celestia radio. All of them, I need to go to a brony meetup one day.
HOLY SHIT
You serious?
Duuude
I've been on since... 2008 I believe, but just got back on
Dont try to assume dari, its not like that...

4*sigh* Just don't talk anymore about it in the main room. If someone brings up the interview, just say it's private
too small for me though :(
Its not like that...at all
4You don't have to prove yourself to anybody
maybe a brony con x3
10yup

Do any of you know the ferris wheel?

Lol
Or am I making jokes to myself again.
Shit happened.

Uh oh. PM from the mods? That's like being called down to the principal's office...
Oshit, they're going to FORCE FEED HIM SPIDER'S WEB DDDDD:
Ps rules!

Why did my mind put "You have the power to overcome fear." after Ghosties said Polarfire?
13Good thing I'm straight
[06:51] <Suinide> I only would hurt him out of love <3 maybe tie him up, whip him, dig into him... | FERRIS WHEEL
/me shot
I KNEW IT!
...creepy
wait nvm
I was using the wrong password XD
bad vibes?
Fear is the mind killer
Lol
man
Nah, probably just read too much Green Lantern Corps. :p
Fear is the little death.
FEAR? That game was killer
that brings total annihilation
Those who call it creepy, i call wusses
Dammit.
Obliteration, not annihilation.
7lol
13Suinide, how do you feel about me being straight?
Ohhhh dari
Your dead
I think I get the ferris wheel thing
13No I'm not
4Dashite
Oh really now
?
4PM
is it by any chance a reference to a certain character named N?
Nope.
icy you are so all over the damn place what are you a parrotfish
Ponychan meme.
Nevermind then
oh my god N on the ferris wheel he's fuckin creepy
13No, I'm a slut
I believe I'm all set
now*
A gay slut
For you less nerdy folks, when a Green Lantern is recruited their rings will say "(Insert name here) of (Insert home planet here). You have the ability to overcome great fear."
13Nnnnnnope
Green Latern = Worst super gero ever.
*hero
Eeyup
Nah, that would be Aquaman. Green Lanterns are fucking epic.
SYRUP!
making matter from thought is bad?
SYRUP EVERYWHERE!
13And last I checked you're the girl here
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yyyyyyyyesp
aquaman is worse
Big dea
/me Wilhelm screams.
Deal
though i liked the muscle one
I didn't say the super POWER was bad, just the weilder
so um RainBroDash I got a DA thing now you wanted the link?
yeah I got that from you lol
there are 3 earth rings
10do it roman :D

It's a good thing I don't have school anymore for the rest of my life lol
10Duuude I love it! :D Good job!
WHICH wielder? There's four Earth Lanterns, and the rest of the Corps from all over the universe.
Heh. Nice. :D
Not counting collage.

You're probably forgetting Kyle.
nice job romna
He can make literally ANYTHING... "I only have 30 seconds to save the universe! What can I make that will let me kill every enemy here!?" *Makes giant green mace* "For Equestria!!!"
heh thanks...
*makes mini gun, then drops a titanic ship*
13MEN
matter wins
lol
but really, there are more then one lantern
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME!
Alrazial Kadore!
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD:
Kyle didn't technically have a ring before since he was Ion, he was forced to give that power up to a new Ion though so now he's an honour guard with Guy.
/me cuts self
13I understand...
?
Batman is the best, no "Super-power" still beats everyone. Without killing.
You understand nothing.
That backpack is awesome
I want one D:
when icy is alone he sings its raining men in a rain slicker in the fancy mirror in the kitchen while he makes funny brownies
:D
/me 7is still cold
He makes cupcakes
Batman + Green Latern ring = unstoppable.
Turn up the heat or something
13My weed brownies are a family secret
he had a ring once
Guy Gardner and Bats are brilliant together, I always love the one scene when Guy moons Batman from outside the Watch Tower and spells the words "Bye bye Bats." with his ring.
but i forgot whicho ne
*one**
I'm gonna have to go with Stark. Robotic exoskeleton > whatever batman has.
Man, it's too early here, keep messing up my words
Batman's reply? "Tell Gardner he needs a shave."
oh jeez

that girl in the red sweater looks so awkward
What does IE stand for anyway? In example? (Not the Internet Explorer)
Jedi Drinking Song is awesome.

She's very much insane
I like a lot of older rock music. Stuff from the 60's all the way up to the 90
but in a good way
hard to explain
and of course pony music
*is listening to fluttershy sing*
Sorry if I'm spamming, the Kit-Kats just hit my bloodstream.
IE stands for id est
Which means, in English, that is.
Wow I can't type at all tonight...
Translates as that is.
lmao

Psh, I don't really care, but I view people who use Linux as pretty impressive
13Lol remember that gay song that was on when we called last night?
o.o
Linuz is badass, mac is just... mac and windows is just stoopid
I am virus free and will remain that way indefinitely.
Caps lock isnt needed all the time. *ding* the more you know
Yesa
Plus it works great with older hardware.
Pfft. Only Windows let's me play my games without any extra crap. Therefore Windows > *

Linux would be too much of a hassle for me, I suck at coding
As am I, because I know how to properly maintain my Windows installation. :p

It's silly when people talk about how any OS is better or worse when it comes to viruses. Really unless you're the sort of dumbass who does things like clicking on a popup that says your computer is infected viruses are a moot point.
I love how we're all bronies XD
/me cant help but like it
See, my GPU is so bad that I'm lucky it can play some visual novels.
Thou hast just received the Amish Virus. As we haveth no technology nor programming experience, this virus worketh on the honour system. Please delete all the files from thy hard drive and manually forward this virus to all on thy mailing list. We thank thee for thy cooperation.
Yeah I kept my windows pretty virus free..... But wit linux I don't have to worry about any of that anymore.

What distro u have?
I like AVG, doesn't block ANYTHING, but it destroys viruses on your computer pretty well.
i forgot its been a while x3
XD
I don't have to worry about any virus protection...
I can't use AVG, the name makes me keep expecting it to shout "AAAAAAASSSSSSSS!" and blow up NES games.
lol
...maybe...
you people are boring
I've got MSE running on a couple systems in the house. Seems to work pretty well and is good about remaining unobtrusive under normal use.
if somepony attacks me, a virus is countered
Boring
Boring!
You can use wine in linux to run games btw.
Boring...?
Ill show you boring
I stopped using AVG when the free version got too bloated.
I've heard it can be difficult though.
do you guys know how corn bread was made
no
how?
*tears down my wall and blows up a preschool
Depends on the games and the hardware you have.
AWESOME! SonicFSeries uploaded 3 new vids! One is the commentary behind Camaraderie is Supernatural!

Cause Applejack is worst pony?
Normal Pony doesn't get much love ;_;
Agreed
4Applejack is a good pony
Applejack is second least best pony.
I like AJ :(
13Nooooooooooooooo- oh hey a real pony
4I also like AJ, Polar
what about Pinkie? >Implying Pinkie is "normal"
4USERS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
*cusses*
I FIGHT FOR THE USERS!
lol, tron
How are you tonight, Ghosties?
7D:
Applejack recieves 1 love
A CHALLENGER APPEARS!
4I am meh, Bane
*+1 love
This chat room needs to be about 20% cooler
4And how are you?
13PONIES AND EPIC SAX GUY!?!?! *jizz*
Pinkie Pie>Pinkamena>Flutterage>Twilight>Fluttershy>Rarity>Applejack>Rainbow Dash = All awesome, some just less than others.
Pretty sweet, just saw two of my favorite artists at a concert
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
4Which artists?
Did you just put Dash at the bottom of your list?
> Applejack > Rainbow Dash
SamiYam and JonWayne
Yes.
>Prepares ze sheild
4Never heard of them : /
4Glad you had a good time, though
What's up with you, though
7:o
any reason you're meh, or is it just one of those nights?
4Applejack: Or, how about AJ=RD since they're both voiced by the same actress?
I just... I can't wrap my brain around how someone could put Dash at the bottom...
4Well, I've been in the stream for about 12 hours now
/me 7struggles, then falls to the floor under Ray's weight
I like twilight and AJ... then pinkie pie and rainbow dash tied for 2nd.
Me? Or the character? :P
Are you sure you didn't mean for all of those to be < instead of >
?
4This has literally been my whole day, so, I'm exhausted
Eeenope.
Geez Ghosties.
Dang

4It ain't easy being a mod
02Meep? b-but.. I'm like... 30cm
Dang Seth:P
Apparently!
I bet.
I swear he doesnt sleep.
It would be nice though
There is no way.
4I do sleep
Dee_Twenty suddenly imagines Ghosties singing to the tune of It Ain't Easy Being Green.
4Just not during typical night hours
7..oh.
If there's any way I could help
4Usually by the end of the night
/me 7stands up
BLARG
Do you normally work nights or something?
So many urls, either expensive computer, no life, or urls saved
Seth over at EQ daily. he posts every hour with the exception of a small break from 5-7 am... and apparently works.
Yo prefiero el potro loco mas que los otros
02Now, Good Night~
4Dee_Twenty: Actually, I was imagining Chester from Cheetos during Family Guy "It ain't easy being cheesy"
/me head asplode
URLs in history.
4Bane: Don't worry about it man, this is my job
Ghosties, you're Seth?
Same thing
7night.
As saved
Sorta
>MFW Family Guy actually has people who watch it and I can't post a reaction image because this isn't Ponychan.
Kind
A
4Dashite: I'm here for the stream on Fridays and Saturdays; almost always pre show and post show
:O
/me 7runs in circles =D
DUN DUN DUUUUUUNNNNNNN
4Applejack: Seth? Which Seth?
Seth at EQ daily
Yeah, I've seen you around during and after the show. Just didn't know how long you were around before hand.
I assume he means Sethisto.
/me eeps
4Ah, him
The EqD Seth? Or maybe I just read Polar's post wrong
4Nope, I'm not Seth
/me gets dizzy
No Sethisto at EQ daily
4That would be disastrous really :S
4Not Sethisto, that's what I was implying
Seth is pretty cool
Oh.
OK, sorry, I had a legit blonde moment
And here I thought we had a plot twist........
4I am Ghosties; Ponychan regular, BMN mod, and namer of the Sweetie Derelle meme
>namer of the Sweetie Derelle meme

7Hi :D
I am Polarfire; nameless.
>all my manly tears
4Heh, sorry, no plot twist guys
awww...
4Unless you count naming a meme a twist :D
/me 7proceeds to fall in vertical circles.
That's pretty cool though. Whats the meme?
Who would want to look at Twist's plot anyway? It's too underdeveloped.
I am Sol; /pony/ regular, frequent annoyance on BMN, unknown otherwise
AJ van you be Sol again... XD

4Gotta admit, I was pretty stoked when I saw my name on the page
Dee_Twenty: Wow, that video is awesome.
Dari, do you have that clip of Spike playing the sax?
SO AWESOME
No rainbow dash
I know it's in that long video, but is there a clip of just that?
I am Polarfire; nameless unless you know where to look.
That's it ^
I am Dee Twenty, /pony/ regular and destroyer of squirrels!
That's awesome! There's a pony for that!
XD perfect
thanks
13Ponies the anthology?
7nuuu
Dari you haven't seen that commercial?
Yeah.
13God I love that
Nope.
Here's a question, who here that visits by pony-chan uses their BMN handle?
I wonder if any of the other mane six names are unregistered.
its Awesome!!!!
4Me
4I do
I do.
I'ev been busy for the last week.
I've
I lurk, I don't post.
last 2 weeks*
It just came out today.
4I've seen Dee_Twenty quite a few times on Ponychan
Twilight is Registered
yeah, that's really good
Its a commercial made for the bronies :D
I love the dramatic anime scene where he's looking for a pen and paper
then the dramatic music just STOPS
Hahaha.
"DEAR PRINCESS CELESTIA"
So, who wants to help me make cupcakes?
GAAAHHH
RUN
Oh, that apple style MLP advert is official
I didn't even realise.
Uh...
>_>
AWESOME MUCH.
Woah, is it for the show or is there actually a pony app?
Pinkie isn't take :P
Nor Pinkie_Pie.
Theres a pony app
xD
I has it
13Oh fuck yeah
WOW
Ahhh chat has gotten down th where I like it :)
Rainbow_Dash is not taken
That surprises me
nice and reasonable :)
How has Rainbow_Dash not been taken?
That advert is almost as awesome as the MLP billboard.
Rainbow apparently is though.
That billboard...
>Other ponies "SRS BIZNIZ YO!"
hrgrgrgrg
I want that IN my neighborhoos
>Pinkie Pie "CUPCAKES! :D"
*Neigh-bor-hoove
I would be so disappoint if THIS were taken before Pinkie_Pie or Rainbow_Dash.
so many different names
So far, Applejack, Rainbow_Dash, and Pinkie_Pie aren't taken
time check. 1:45 here?
7LOL WTF http://chzgifs.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/meanwhileinfinlandp1.gif
It won't even let me change it to Rarity, it kicks me out of mibbit if I do that
2:46
:3
LUNA IS FREE
OMG
Sol as Luna. :D
xD
That amuses me more than it should.
hope I didn't forget anything I have to do tomorrow.
um...can you please...um you know...go back to the moon
i mean if you want to
Fluttershy would never say that...
.... I'm so sorry! I missed you big sister?
Indeed, she would say "You're... going to LOVE ME!" instead.
Oh lawd RPing giez srsly? DDDDD:
You'd think with as much Luna love as there apparently is that it'd be one of the first names to be taken
Oh gods, Nightmare Fluttershy.
hmm
BWAHAHAHAHAHA
how did i change my name xD
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER
OK guys game idea.
YOU WILL LOVE ME FOREVER OR FACE MY WRATH! Um... if it's not too much trouble...
2 people pick characters to RP. then go for 2 mins solid while everyone watches then comments later.
The phrase "Luna is now known as Nightmare_Moon" amuses me more than it should XD
Anybody?
:D
I'm still thinking that in terms of epic the "MLP FIM FanFic" video is most epic.
Fluttershy: ...
The Cupcakes Movie Trailer is pretty close behind.
For the next two minutes.
Well crap I'm just a barren wasteland for ideas today :(
I mean epic as in spine-tingling here by the way.
ah
I'd go with the cupcakes one then
Nobody else wants to play? I don't wanna go first
but all the movie trailers with ponies I've seen were pretty gpood
I'm no good at emulating existing characters. :/
I'm mad
I wanted to make a Serenity MLP trailer
then last friday
someone beats me to it
But you gotta stay in character and have a REAL conversation... or whatever you want it to be.
for 2 minutes.
it's pretty awesome though
Lets see how funny we can make it?
I'm in, I guess
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P3HHpf-fZY <- that could've been me
IDk, how2NMM well though
:<
So that makes 3 out of 16 XD
come on mods!!
Kinky Pie climbs up on the nearest table in a saloon girl outfit. "We may be divided, but of you all I beg, to remember we're all hooved at the end of each leeeg! No matter what the issue, come from where ever you please! All this fighting gets you nothing, but hoof in mouth disease!"
4Well folks, it's time I leave the stream. Behave yourselfs, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW

I prefer to think of myself as being perfectly centred rather than leftwing or rightwing.
I think I'm out for the night. 3am is about my limit after being up at 7am.

I drank 3 mountian dews!!!

Mines probablt right right now
Lawl, wikiponia

Why so lag?
So wants to play? rules are 2 people pick characters and stay in character while talking or doing something for 2 minutes...
And only they chat.
Lets see how funny we can make it?
I think it's your colors
Nobody?
Hmm.
Well lets atleast talk or something
last time he responded when I did it
see watch
oops
chat dead?
Meh, colours.
3 o' clock, bed time
Night Polarfire
Well I guess I'm out then. Just when it got reasonable... I like it when there's only a few people left because you can carry on legit conversation.

Bye bye
Good night

I like pickles?
What music do you listen too? What are you like IRL? I want somebody to talk to at 2 in the AM.
Enlighten me
Weird, I was just watching that
0Well I'm off, good night everyone!
Night :(
Pretty much whatever sounds good, and anti-social.
bye bane
that's interesting. how many good RL friends do you have?
Currently? Carry the two... None.
:( that makes me sad
Wait, it's "mother hubbard"?
I have about.. 4 or so that I talk to...
I thought it was "mother hoover". XD
Thought the voiceover must have been done by the guy who made the video, hahaha.
But none that really are what I would call lifetime friends.
Not me, I find the notion that physical proximity is important in any non-romantic relationship antiquated at best.
Woah man.
Where exactly does the antiquated fit into that sentence? Could you elucidate?
Yeah I don't get.
Is Dari asleep :P
Never.
Or lurking..
yep.
:P
Are you from the UK?
Yep.
What time is it there?
8 am
Outdated, no longer relevant. In the modern age one is easily capable of keeping in contact between cell phones and computers without having to be in the same country let alone room.
Woah so you're just starting your day. That's cool. It's waaaay past bedtime here.
oh hey it's dari
apparently I'm you dari
Hahaha, who said that? XD
mmmm
everyone
If anything you're more likely to get a better idea of a person's real personality online than you are in person.
I have SUPER LURKING POWERS
Can I post in color?
And I agree with D20
about the personality thing.
Ah right, haha, that makes sense.
Fine.
Since I'm the only mod on, you guys can post colours.
Most people are far more willing to admit to things online behind the curtain of anonymity than they are in person.
12I CHOOSE BLUE
12Thanks
That is so difficult to read
Too dark
12And D20 you are right. Online people don't have anything to hide from others.
Choose a lighter shade please?
11Light blue?
much better thank you
11ok.
9this is so much of a pain for me!
13Pink pony font is best pony font.

Baking these treats is such a cinch ad a teaspoon of vanilla! Add a little more and you count to four and you never get your fill of... cupcakes! So sweet and tasty! Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty!
11bump
11Just a Dash?
What's gay.pl?
9cupcakes?
1313That doesn't look like esperanto.
9it's an infamous irssi script but you're on mirc
7I had the most amazing cupcakes last weewk!
9it lets you do stuff like rainbow text and giant block letters of ascii art
11Seriously lets not talk about cupcakes.

11Its like a party up in hurr
Ahh.
13 13Yes, ja det gør.
11with all the colors
11herp derp
13Apparently there is no Danish word for cupcakes.
7Well, they were cupcakes made from banana bread with just light vanilla frosting. I would have never thought of using banana bread.
11I had bananna pudding the other day.... Thought it would be gross but it was amazing.
13I love banana puddin' with Nilla Wafers.
Banana strudel, blueberry crumble.
They had foods from all sorts of different countries.
It was really good.
Turning off the rainbow text now. XD

What do you mean?
13Insane.
11Are you like us? like.... I'm not sure how to say it... Are you like us XD
11foo
11:P
13We have better food, for example.
11Are you guys in a shit ton of debt too?
11What do you mean? like movies?
13Cajun food>Any non-Italian European food, and most Asian foods too. <3
Movies, things like trick-or-treating (which I've never taken part in :P), food, stuff in language.
11Ah.
11I see.
11U guys watch the shuttle launch?
13And they call jelly jam, even though jelly is completely different from jam.
Is this recent news?
11today
Nope then.
11the last nasa shuttle took off from FL.
Lawl, you guys have jelly and jam the wrong way round.
13Don't watch the news, waste of time.
11I hate the news but that was something I wanted to see.
Jelly - as in gelatin, that stuff that jiggles around on a plate. :P
13Nuh uh, you call gelatin jelly, and you call both jelly and jam jam.
11It went 3200 mph!! :O
No we don't.
13Jelly doesn't go on a plate, it goes on a sandwich.
Jelly = http://www.comparestoreprices.co.uk/images/pe/personalised-jelly-mould.jpg
11U guys play an instrument?
Jam = http://images.mylot.com/userImages/images/postphotos/2353112.jpg
11I play the piano
11and try to sing miserably
11XD
13http://home.gwi.net/~spectrum/pbandj/pbj.jpg = Real jelly.
7I play clarinet, bass clarinet, tenor saxophone, and bassoon. And I am currently teaching myself flute and trumpet.
How is that jelly? It's not a gelatin food.
11JELLY JAM IT DOESNT MATTER!!!!!!!
7But I am a horrible singer.
11I pretend I can match pitch but I cant.
13It's not supposed to be gelatin, gelatin is gelatin.
11but I can try :D
Jelly = a gelatin dessert.
11but hey sotha that's pretty cool. I mess with guitar also.
11I play both by ear I can't read music.
7Sotha can't play stringed instruments at all either! c:
7I can only read music. /can't improvise or play by ear. :F
13Jelly = fruit juice and pectin creating a clear fruit spread. Jam = similar but contains both juice and pieces of fruit flesh.
7I hope to become better at improv though, considering how much I love jazz.
11I pure improv everything pretty much. AND OMG GUYS!!! IT DOESN't MATTER!
Our definition of jelly and jam came before yours, in UK English ours is right. :P
11GAAAHHH
7I prefer preserves.
11DO YOU TOO BLANK FLANKS PLAY SOMETHING
/me 7will be back?
11*2
7Why are they blank flanks?
11Cause they're arguing over nothing... Idk...
11I wanna know if they play anything.
13I play video games.
7Or is it just a naive derogative?
11I need to post a vid of me playing piano on youtube
11Dari do you play anything?
I wish I did, but nope.
13Your English is USUALLY correct, you're just silly about certain things like calling gelatin jelly and jelly jam. :p
11You guys need to learn something.
...
You can't call the original wrong.
Your version of the language is based on it.
11I can play this:
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgZsGLlS1g
13I can call it silly though. :p
Why is it silly...?
13Because you have no way to differentiate between a jam and a jelly.
Yes we do...
11ugh
I told you.
11chat IS dead
11pretty much
11Oh well.
Jelly means this:
And only that.
Nothing else.
That's all jelly means.
13You call them both jam, so how am I supposed to ask if a store carries jelly when they'd point me to the gelatin instead?
We don't.
They aren't both jam.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6z3WXuzXXc
11OMFG GUYS!!!!!!!
The picture I posted before is jelly.
Just jelly.
Not jam.
What you spread on toast is jam.
Not jelly.
13Exactly, you call gelatin jelly instead of calling jelly jelly, you call jelly jam.
Just jam.
We call gelatin gelatin?
13There's no way to differentiate jam, which is a form of preserve, from jelly, which is made with fruit juice and pectin.
...
They are completely different words.
They mean completely different things.
They have nothing to do with each other.
11I can also play this
13Indeed, just like they're completely different products.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXUT9U8q2YM
They are completely different products.
11Sotha u there still?
So how can you not distinguish between them?
They have two separate completely unrelated not linked words.
Jam - http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UIXOn06Pz70/SGaJFpoeJXI/AAAAAAAADsA/uE-FJbHUa7o/s800/Strawberry+and+Rhubarb+Jam+500.jpg
Jelly - http://www.jellybean88.com/wp-content/uploads/15_5_orig.jpg
It's that simple.
Those words are exclusive.
They aren't used for anything else.
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jelly
So what?
11Night I guess guys.
Cya.
04o-o
11Next friday I guess
11Is there anyone here on weekdays?
11...
13Describe jam then, made with fruit pieces, yes?
0Night D20 and Dari
Night.
13That's still called jam here, or sometimes preserves.
Wait, you guys have two words for the same thing?
lol
13Jam and preserves are sometimes used interchangably, but some people differentiate them by saying a preserve is a cooked and gelled WHOLE fruit or vegetable.
13Both contain actual pieces of fruit however.
I don't think you understand what jam and jelly mean in English.
UK English*
13Jelly by contrast only contains fruit JUICE and is solidified with pectin.
You eat jam with toast, jelly with a spoon.
'nuff said.
7I agree with Ponyfire. Is this like a more regular chat thing where people are here on the weekdays too? Or is the only activity around the time when the broadcast is online?
13I think some people chat here during the rest of the week, I only show up for the movie nights though.
Generally it's just mods and maybe a couple of lurkers at times other than streams.
Morning all
That is what jelly is in the UK.
13And I understand how both words are used in the UK, that's the problem, I can't go into a store in the UK and ask if they have any jelly in stock because they'd point me in the direction of the gelatin, I have to ask for jam instead.
What jam is in the US I have no idea.
ih
13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves#Jam Jam is jam.
That's the whole point.
If you ask them for jelly, they'd point you to jelly.
Gelatin desserts.
13But that's not what I want, I want jelly, not gelatin.
If you ask them for jam, they'd point you to jam.
!kickme
XD
So you ask for jam.
i was/bored
Not jelly.
If you want jelly, you ask for jelly.
If you want jam you ask for jam.
Orly now?
How can you not understand that?
13I don't want jam though, I want jelly, no fruit pieces, just gelled fruit JUICE.
I don't know what you mean now.
13Read the listings in the preserves wiki for both jam and jelly, they're completely different.
7Good night as well.
13Jam contains both fruit juice and pieces of the fruit's (or vegetable's) flesh,[12] although some cookbooks define jam as cooked and gelled fruit (or vegetable) purees.[13] Properly, the term jam refers to a product made with whole fruit, cut into pieces or crushed. The fruit is heated with water and sugar to activate the pectin in the fruit.
13The mixture is then put into containers. The following extract from a US cookbook describes the process.
13Jelly is a clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable) juice and set using naturally occurring pectin. Additional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.[12] Jelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients.
13It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette "jelly bag" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining proce
13It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised.
13See? Two completely different things, but there's no word to differentiate the two in the UK, they're both called jam.
We just have jam.
13...That is horrible, you should rebel against your rulers for depriving you of the wonderfulness of jelly.
It's disgusting.
What's the point of it without the fruit?
The fruit is the whole point of jam.
13You get a completely different texture and taste.
"Jam is whole fruit cooked in sugar until the flesh is soft. Jelly is fruit juice cooked with pectin or gelatin until it congeals.

"
7Ooh, activity. *shot*
13It's like the difference between a good steak and a hamburger.
13They're both beef, and they both taste good, but they don't taste the same and have very different textures.
7:D
Wait a second.
Wb ray
7RAY :D
going out for dinner, bbl
Lol Ray's still asleep XD
Bouncer xD
13No no no, jello is made with gelatin and is eaten as a desert, jello is what you call jelly. Jelly is a spread and is made with pectin.
Nou
He leaves his IRC on at night
7brb, dinner.
like me~
and kk
Lol, timezones
13To be accurate Jell-O is a specific BRAND of gelatin, but it's come to be used to describe ALL gelatin regardless of brand, much like Xerox is often used to refer to any copying machine even if it's not made by Xerox.
Well if you want to you can just buy jam without fruit pieces.
13That's what we'd call jelly.
7back
7lol
Jello is essentially a type of jelly.
Wb
7shiz, is that the fastest I've ever had dinner? O_o
13Precisely.
13And jelly, in the US, is apparently what YOU would call jam without the fruit pieces.
I believe so
4 mins?
7 3 minutes.
Right
7o.o
13Our method is far more efficient, jelly is much faster to say than "jam without the fruit pieces."
Because your "jelly" isn't big in the UK, no one would ever look specifically for jam without fruit pieces.
No one really cares.
7I'm known for eating slowly. XD
They just want jam.
apparently they had a C&C4
13I want both, just depends on what I'm in the mood for on my sandwich.
13Never got into Command and Conquer, I always preferred Age of Empires for RTS games.
Also, looking at pictures of jelly, I see no discenable difference from jam.
discernable*

7I'm going to try to draw with a mouse.
discernible**
Its fun
13It's the lack of actual fruit pieces, it makes a huge difference in texture and taste.
Believe me xD
7It's hard D:
I've had jam without bits of fruit in it before.
13Jam tends to be a bit stronger tasting and chunky.
Ikr?
lol fallout 3 is 10 bucks
Heh
Gimp
I use PainToolSAI
We don't eat it with peanut butter.
Easier, but also glitchy when you don't know how to setupbeverything
i enjoy peanut butter only
13You have my deepest condolences.
sometimes jelly but its more peanut butter for me
13Now I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, what flavours do we have in the house at the moment?
13Ooh, I hope we have some blackberry jelly left, it's my favourite, it or apple.
7lol
im either blue or grape
13I've never liked blueberries that much, I like them in muffins or pancakes but that's it.
I'm pretty much sure you don't get grape jam here.
I herd SAI is what japanese artists use on pixiv
grape jam where
Possible
I use it for everything with art
13o_o Ruben, remind me to see what kind of support Ivan needs to lead a rebellion against their rulers, they need to know the glory that is grape jelly.
7dear god my progress is terrible
ah right x3
04aaaaaaaah
i hope we can also get game going tomorrow
04this sucks
7mouse = worst drawing tool in the history of mankind
i really really want to leave the ponyvillie area
i know its ponyvillie but i want to start your parties real adventure
I use only the mouse
And see what i draw
outside of canterlot borders
but celestria is god so you can't get away from her xD
7link please
Let me try thisbon the
IPad....
13And more importantly I still have a lot more yo' mama jokes to tell the princesses. X3
7Not bad for a mouse.
I know
your character loves the abuse
Practice makes perfect
13Just a bit. :p
don't worry luna will not nuke you just yet
you did that to yourself
And lining tools too
13I almost wish it had been in Ponyville. XD
nah by the celestria would be ripping you to peices
then**
before you could even release it

Yep.....
Thanks
That was the wrong button
13Totally worth it to nuke Snips and Snails.

How is it going?
7Good so far. I have to zoom in for any decent lines.
7I'm a perfectionist. :\
I see....
7For most people, drawing Portal-related stuff with a mouse would be a complete failure without being tried.
7To be blunt.
Agreed xD
7But, I'm trying~
Good
Cant never do enough then your best
So try your best :3

Did you pause the video to read the PNN article on Cutie Marks?
Going through my backlog of anime before I start watching more Gokaiger.
I got a tab open with a list of the frames in it.
(well, the important ones)
so yeah I read the entire thing.
Personally I think it means that there'll probably be a season 3 and four.
I saw Zecora during the add.
*ad
yeah. Best Pony wants you to drink potion.
I find that Zecora don't have enough love. She's appeared in more episodes than trixie!
Nature's remedies?
I think
I think she only appeared in the one episode, but they've talked about her in a few others.
no, she's also in Swarm of the Century
for less than a minute, but she's there.
(she says "You're doomed!" as her last sentence in the episode)
oh wow, I gotta get back to writing my fic...
Fanfic: A day in the life of Zecora?
She does live in the everfree forest after all.
the forest is so large, I'd be surprised if two creatures that appears in two different episodes ever met.
Depends on where in the forest they live.
It's never really mentioned.

10:3
all i see us a gummy
i hear mulan though
Oh, I mad.
6Which we'll need euromods at some point, so, yeah.
All gummy all the time
trolololo
My Ponychan watched threads rest on me again
reset*
definitely
also
someone should pick Mulan as next week's A-movie imo
that happens when you get a new ip, Senor_BroZilla
0We should just play Gummy over all the movies and episodes.
there are tools around it, check the first few pages of /meta/
with more euromods, we can start having chat all the time
wtduck? still 37 minutes
Hi fellow bronies.
6Eyup.
haI
Figures
0Hi Nittany_Tiger!
greetings
6>imply I wasn't going to do that, Aponymous
0Howdy.
Welp, guess I'll stop downloading Pirate Rangers
Greetings, Nittany_Tiger
I always thought it was funny that there are female voices in the background of this song
have to do it on the other internet so I don't take up my own bandwidth
4
as there's only supposed to be one girl >.<
4?
god, this song
(Rarity)
What is going on
NOOO, I want to watch the PMV :(
oh well
6I'm testing the "GUMMY GOES WITH EVERYTHING" theory.
>mfw this song http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee261/jordanstone15/dashmylevelofwantdepends.png
thats why I made a rarity video on youtube
6So far it passes.
brozilla, where are you downloading pirate rangers from?
0It's passing with flying colors SirSprinkles
The Pirate Bay?
...so, I just got auto-kicked and now my Senor_BroZilla handle got stolen
hm
Which about Pirate Bay?
6...how'd you get auto-kicked?
Swapping internet signals
Dave_BroZilla, sometimes if you refresh, your handle stays on and you have to switch names
I was connected to both at the same time

6Good evening.
heyo darkenedpath
0Oh HAI RainBroDash!
Hmmmmmmm
probably saw them I know WIN when I see it
Should it be too much of an issue with the lottery, or should I just post this handle in the thread?
/me brohoofs RainBroDash
10^_^ sup aponymous
10...and TGP hehe
HAI
[13:23:34] <Elky> brozilla, where are you downloading pirate rangers from? [13:23:53] The Pirate Bay?
Hey RainBroDash
Sup, RainBroDash? Y'all still best mod? >:]
6But yeah, Hipster, the plan was down the line to have two mods under each of the mane mods for if/when we have to start splitting the chat to multiple rooms.
6Nope, that would be me.
yup, I just never used torrents
i know
sux when all the pony is in the morning on saturdays
also, sup rainbro
6that's enough of that
SirSprinkles, I gave you two opportunities to be best mod yesterday, and you passed them up and or were too slow
10CAJ y u no full name? And nah, give Sprinkles his glory (he might start kicking me again :3)
06xD
So you lose, get nothing, and good day sir
6I will start kicking you.
Gummy is still appropriate
6Don't think I won't.
10oh shii
6GUMMY GOES WITH EVERYTHING.
10hey hipster
oh, sirsprinkles~! *swoooooooon*
also, this totally needs to be made into a PMV at some point: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ipyWYO3LM
and if you do kickfest 2011 continues.
Gummy is best pony.
0Gummy > Guile's Theme
DAMMIT RIHANNA, YOU KILLED TAINTED LOVE
WHAT THE HELL KATY PERRY
I kinda like being under mods cause I would't want to deal with noobies
TAINTED LOVE IS CLASSIC ROCK, THIS IS A DISGRACE
6...yes.
6...my level of want...depends.
Gummy could take over the whole damned world if he wanted.
http://i233.photobucket.com/albums/ee261/jordanstone15/dashmylevelofwantdepends.png I still had it on my clipboard :P
yo what would colts call a cutie mark? it isn't masculine at all (No offense)
But yeah, this link has individual torrents for each episode, just scroll to bottom and open the collapsible list
http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=separate&user=93569
an awesome mark
0They call it a Cutie Mark 'cause they don't give a fuck.
A coltie mark?
Nope
why do some epiisodes have 2 verions
I'm thinking a purpose
oh, thanks
HD/SD
RDs song
you can't deny it
One of the versions of episode 1 doesn't have any Peers, i think it said v3 int he title
don't get that one
Gummy kissed Pinkie and he liked it
what
06!shipping
4 Espeon is paired with Cube
FUNKY
06nofloof
0What's this now?
Rainbow Dash Tylenol?
I think
6Yeah.
02Mokou, Y U NO DIE
02;_;
lol, this is so not related, but this somehow reminds me of the Pinkie noises in tune with Chrono Trigger
Anyone in here?
Did we already listen to Avast FLuttershy's Ass?
yup
06heya Ray :3
ass
yarp
eeyup
Doesn't mean we can't do Avast Applejack's Ass
ass
true
Mr. Mod-favourite is in da house!
Because I have been coming in here for that "interview" and no one is ever in here when I come in.
6Oh look, NOW Metal_Link shows up.
0I missed Avast Fluttershy's Ass? I sad now.
Sad I missed it. I learned most of Avast Fluttershy's Ass on piano.
but fluttershy is so much better
i'm pretty sure no ones in here
02Hiya~
02:3c
6...what are you talking about Metal?
6We've always been waiting for you?
Yes, but at least we get to play a version of Avast Your Ass in general
NAWT
Stupidly catchy song
10so who wasn't around last night when we had a bit of a problem late last night, specifically concerning myself and some viewers who deemed it appropriate to question my legitimacy as a mod?
So, I was in a car for 6 hours so I started reading Fallout: Equestria. I've nearly finished chapter 3. I have to say. Pretty awesome.
What SirSprinkles?
i dont think i was
luv MEEEE
oh yeah
explain it to me
/me 6wasn't here
yay i got pinged again D:
i have this on my music playlist on Yuotube
10it was a bad moment for me, and I think it's appropriate I tell you all about it
0L-L-L-L-L-LOVE ME!
6We were waiting for you... and you never showed... Oo
Yuotube?
6Yeah.
I ain't haytin
10Ghosties saw it all, so you'll no doubt hear from him too
no worriez
*youtube, typo
6We share everything, it's kinda mod rules.
Well I came in and no one was there except for a few idle people.
10The way it went down was I got unfortunately taunted into a position where I couldn't help but try and explain to the shitty viewers why I deserve to be a mod, and this ended up with me suggesting -why- I deserved to be a mod, in turn suggesting some of the content of the selection process. It was dumb and I've apologised and I won't hesitate to apologise aga
10wall of text time
What is this called?
fluttershy sparta remix
I think
you're going to love me sparta remix
Hank hill kick your ass sparta!
I still think Don't Stop Believing/Enter Sandman mash-up should be played
ORLY?
6That's... odd.
whats that band called?
6it seems like TF2 isn't working for me
I eard it before
how about NO
6I'll talk it over with the other mods, Metal.
Rock Sugar. Lead singer was voice of Wakko Warner
I want to play the song 'I'm Awesome' over this GIF.
whut is odd delarobia?
6its taking FOREVER to look for a game
oh what
I came in late because some ding dong at the internet company killed one of the fiber optic cables and I had no internet all day on Thursday.
FUCK YES!
BUTTERFLY
6Well, that explains it then.
hey, i'm actually here
6unless there's literally NO ONE playing
in the future, if anyone questions your legitimacy as a mod, tell them we hired you because we are convinced you would be an effective moderator
0SO MUCH yay
he finished your optic cables Sam Fisher
and gummy
6Apparently Metal_Link had no internet all Thursday.
Can't tell if want.
DJ FlyShy in da house!
if they have a problem with it they can complain to us
0Gummy = Samurai
I'M TURNING JAPANESE TURNING JAPANESE TURNING JAPANESE I REALLY THINK SO
aiiiiiiiiiii samuraiiiiiiiiiiiii
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJHvzJiiXAM
needs more Shutterfly
but you shouldnt need to defend your legitimacy as a mod
10I know Hipster, and it was fucking stupid of me to stoop to it
6The links. No.
6Even if it is what I'm playing.
what exactly did you say?
10we'll have to rely on dari for that
needs moar sluttershy
10I was fucking livid, so I forgot to screencap
0I first heard this song when someone put it over the knife fight in RE4.
give me the gist of it
Sorry SirSprinkles
06time to nom
06and o.o
i first heard this song playing dance dance revolution
skaiii samuraiiii aiiiii
6If somepony needs it, they can ask me and I'll post it.
I tried coming in on Friday but chat was crazy from Brony Movie night so there was no chance. So I decided to come back today in the morning and here all of you are with a tame chat.
ddr? whut version?
10Two people in particular were saying how much longer they've been watching BMN than me, and talking about my 'sudden ascension' to mod status (which is just the wrong way to get it, completely) so I said something along the lines of:
cant remember
so what are we watching and when? first time here
the one with the butterfly song
we're starting in an hour
6Check the home page, gorutsuki
HuffytheMagicDragon >>mfw sluttershy http://i56.tinypic.com/2cffi14.png
I got ultramix2 with a dance mat for my old XBOX
6 20 minutes, we're starting in.
okay thanks
I would've stayed here yesterday but the lag was too great. I only get to see WWU.
oh right
tron?
Derezzed?
fuck my being unable to calculate
i have euromix 1 and 2
WAT? LOLOLOLOOLOLOLO X D XD
you'd think that if you're majoring in math you'd be good with numbers...
i was trolling yesterday. i said winter wrap up sucked.
i played the others at an arcades
SirSprinkles, when does thw drawing happen?
10"I wasn't plucked out of the crowd as if to say 'RBD you'll do', I applied, went through an interview process and was tested on my worth and how I can actually help BMN, and my modding history, etc" <- that was the part that was stupid to say. Ghosties pointed out to me in mod chat that it was unacceptable to mention the interview process, to keep it the same
10for every individual applicant
I almost minored in Math.
they see me trollin' they kickin'
o_o;
that song is good...
no kicks. i avoided them
what is it?
I could drown in this track forever
euro mix 2 i fc'ed most apart from the end of the century
Aurora, it's pretty much the same for me, but once inside it works fine. It's usually connecting to the server that slows it down
Daft Punk - Derezzed
that was a bitch
avoided them like dead poniez
oh whoops.
I forgot I had another mIRC window |D
they're cheap in vrittain
brb food
britain
thanks
FEWD
Also, SirSprinkles, PM
ok, do you remember who the users were?
also, sprinkles
gotta pizz
epic sax spike to gummy
do it filly
TV theme?
yeah, we wanted to know that
ginas?
6I'm doing it shortly.
Pinkie's theme.
6And Nyan cat
10Ghosties dealt with it at the time, but it had been happening gradually, I can't remember exactly, but it felt like I was just getting a bit of 'new mod' stick for quire a while
PARTY PARTY JOIN US JOIN US
PARTY PARTY JOIN US JOIN US
PARTY PARTY JOIN US JOIN US
I wonder what this song is traing to get me to do.
oh
trying*
SHAKE YOUR TAIL AND *something*
Darky
ok
:3
Is this song stream have requests?
pparty soft
10but the users if I remember rightly that were dealt with were Dashite and Polarfire* <- i think that's right?
xepher next please
i know you probably know this already, but im going to say it anyways
caj: 'when you can'
10I got a PM apology from dashite
Hooray
I used antibacterial soap BITCH!!!!!
we need our mods to "stay above the fray" if you will
0*Wonders how Gummy goes with The Land of the Lost theme*
basically, dont get angry
Gummy = Guile
Play Tool.
WEIRD AL
if you're having issues, vent about them in mod chat
angry white boy polka next?
Aponymous, Gummy goes well with everything.
req: konata is sky high
but dont show your anger in the main room and dont moderate from a place of anger
because thats how bad decisions get made
6Vent here if you need to.
and as a mod, you're representing the entire team
6And let one of the other mods handle it if you get angry.
10Yeah. I personally felt like I wasn't doing too badly for the first 11 and a half hours xD but I completely understand. and it's a lesson that I ended up learning it a stupid way, instead of the sensible, gradual way
i like this medly the most
Req: Parabola (w/ Parabol).
so the things you do affect how people see all of us
I think could work with 'Fuck The Police'
from ghost ride it?
shit
it's 4am
/me sleeps
10I'm really sorry again. I got pretty mad last night too, and I need to make sure I apologise to Ghosties too, cause I vented at him a little bit, just in case I inadvertently offended him at all
still no twi posters in this library
Braeburn is Snoop Dog.
This is canon.
ohai Ray
canon camera canon
10just covering all the bases. the worst thing would be for this incident to carry on further, it was a stupid thing to do, and I believe I've learned from the experience
RARITY IS A GOLD DIGGER
0CAJ: That is GENIUS.
But she still best pony
inddeed
NO SHE ISN'T
thankz
okay, maybe
PINKIE PIE IS WEIRD AL
6Once I start the ep, I'm gonna go check my bank account at the ATM in store to see if my wire transfer went through.
Tried to get some Twilight posters in my library, Librarian said she wants more "Student work"
6Just saying that now.
All ponies are best pony.
I want a Rainbow Dash meteo-related poster.
student work? BS
6EPIC SAX GUMMY
but applejack is a little bester than the others
0Just say the Ponies are part of an assignment.
OH YEAAAAAAAAAAAH
YES! DO EET
eeeeenope
oh no
Elky, the most epic of Brohoofs
ok
manual labor pony is best in some cases
After yesterday, iamokwiththis.jpg
and rainbro, you're fine, just wanted to make sure you knew that
6GUMMY GOES WITH EVERYTHING.
the most
this song is making me feel so epic right now
modding here can be a little stressful at times
/me got nickalerted
6>a little
02Hi~
all ponies are equal but some are more equal than others
6Let's go with that...
=
slowpoke
fluttershy is most equal
6And that's really modding ANYWHERE...
ITS NEVER STOPS
10Yeah it was just so stupid
Gummy is best pony, now that I think about it.
Rarity is more equal than fluttershy
/me need a Charisma check to find Penn State bronies and infect every library with Twi Read posters.
loop'd
0This is the most epic repetitive loop ever.
i am trying to see who gets the refrence
6"What makes you so high-and-mighty?" Is a frequent thing you'll have to deal with...
Animal Famr
gewdd, very gewd
Farm*
exactly
can we just skip the movies and watch this for the whole evening?
/me is finally watching the last episodes of C - The Money of Soul and Possibility Control.
*brohoof* good job
transfarmers comic on eqd naw
10it was just the fact I was new though, and that it was my first night
O.o
I didn't finish watching animal farm
schweet
10I'm hoping the bullshit from those guys will be a teething problem
Movie was terrible
6Yeah, which is why it was good Ghosties was there.
Book was great, though
read the book
6I honestly feel bad for having left earlier than I usually do.
book was helluva lot better
10He dealt with it amazingly, I mean, 100% tribute to the guy
there was an animal farm movie?
ugh
one thing i get a lot is people saying the mods are all attention horses because we post in color and dont let anyone else
0i still need to read Animal Farm one of these days.
didn't finish watching van helsing either way too long
You don't wanna know...
Had a lassie-like dog as the protagonist
gotta request it as a b movie
You should read it, its a pretty short book anyway
I bet there was an Animal Farm game based on the movie. :p
6Yeah, but that's because we NEED people to be able to see what we're saying, which is annoying.
Doug the talking dog of Up?
6>>;
I have to read Animal Farm for school over the Summer.
which I don't think it really existed in a major role in the book, if at all
and thats the kind of shit that comes with the territory
aponymous have you read 1984? if not, read it first
oh god it would be a terrible game
10If gummy goes with anything... and Guile's theme goes with anything...
We already came to that conclusion before
6Already did Gummy Guile.
PUT GUILES THEME ON
anythingception?
slowpoke rainbro
DO IT AGAIN I WASN'T HERE
6Maybe right before the mane stream.
i have to read on writing well, genghis khan, and still life with rice
0Elky: It's on my "Don't have, want to read" list with an assload of other books.
No. Tool.
RainBroDash? Like the guy that was on Bronyville?
just wanted to tell you all that because i guarantee it wont be the first time you deal with people questioning your legitimacy
Wait, nevermind.
looptiy loopity loop
please stop spike you're scaring everypony
dat sax
hell, i STARTED this thing and i get people telling me im not qualified to be a mod
i know that feel apon
Oh, so desperately want everybody to enjoy Don't Stop Believing/Enter Sandman mash-up T.T
XD
0This song is SAXY
8NYAN
ALL MY LOVE!
Yeah
i played alto sax, then switched to baritone, i know big sax don't make a big man
ALL MY MONEY!
we all love NYAN
ALL MY NYAN!
0NOOOOOOOOOOO
all of my, take it all
I play Tenor sax now
10i got really angry at myself, because I felt like by not modding properly I'd misrepresented myself in the application, therefore had failed your trust in me : / I mean all I can do is amend the way I deal with people questioning my ability. By attempting to defend my legitimacy as a mod I ended up jeopardising it
Just found a video of Guile's theme with a sonic rainboom.
6It happens every day to every one of us... >>; You just learn to leave it be.
gummy is like... a super meme
Must.
Thinking of becoming an infamous YouTube musician
I have a personal record of 13 hours of it.
Resist
Text Wall
we should make a copy of this gummy vid, nyan-tize the left one, and tac-tize the right one, and then play the two songs at the same time
nyan
6And dude, you're fine, don't stress over it.
0Hmm, Gummy DOES go well with this.
o.O
thats another thing
a gummy version of NYAN....DIBS!
i know a kid named kenny who sat next to me and was arrogant as hell playing tenor sax he was too loud
you're going to mess up
6GUMMY. GOES. WITH. EVERYTHING.
all of us mess up
you have to have a short memory and get over it fast
Prove it. Tool song.
Hah, my teacher had a helluva time getting me to play loud on sax
sirsprinkles is indeed correct
This GIF even proves Gummy goes with Gummy.
10kinda sucks to do it on the first day. that means if I -dont- mess up tonight it's essentially going against the trend :L
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bjkM_y-Wps
0SirSprinkles has proven this today, he deserves a medal of some kind.
you need inhalerz for yer lungz
I just play movie themes and Clarence Clemons sax solos, or at least the sheet music I can find for the Springsteen songs
I used that video to make someone a brony.
8no video links espy
10well I've had about 10 hours sleep last night, so let's hope I don't falter by the end of the stream tonight
Ray; play Morrowind BU
i like the meaning of truth with rainboom
like i said, dont beat yourself up over it
NYAN
just quickly I'm a guy and is it weird to say I got my sister into this?
6Hey Ghosties.
nyan
hi ghosties
0OH HAI GHOSTIES
10NewManiac ah damn. there's a mistaken identity problem there dude
no
4Hello everyone
Word to big bird, Ghosties is here
Hello
oh, ghosties
we still have faith in you as a moderator, one mistake like that isnt going to change that
11I'm not going to be on for long. Just around ten minutes
GO GO PIRATE RANGERS
The main stream has started?
hey
MY DAMN COMPUTER IS SHITTY
Ghosties!
RainBro, I realized I was mistaken. I got you confused with RanBrony.
that girl on eqd knew it ALL
don't remind me of pirate rangers...
suppppp ghostiez
:B
10it turns out that when I picked my name there was a guy who'd already started posting on ponychan (where I don't really go) under the name Rain Bro Dash...
Pirate Pony Rangers?
and the fact that you told us means you learned from it
10also, GUILE'S THEME
Pirate Rangers was ok, but it wasn't my cup of tea
SO. EPIC
6Mistaken identity. It happens everywhere.
guile's theme eh? amin event is next
*main
6Everypony likes to think I'm the writer of Cupcakes. Which we're not going to get into.
really?
heh
RainBro is temp admin?
so are you?
0GUMMY + GUILE'S THEME = DESTRUCTION OF WORLD FROM AWESOME
really? was it you?
as if by magic
which ep is first?
Same name as author?
Winter Wrap Up
8nittany: nope
Y U DODGY SIRSPRINKLES GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE, HMMMM?
WWU? sweet :D
6Close to same name.
ignaesia: Mare in the Moon
Hey RainBro
*trollface*
Magic, Hip?
:O
8RainBroDash is a full mod here
Also, around 1/2 of the BronyState mods are from PA. I think PA is the center of the internet. I know so many people from PA online.
haha
Oh U troll :)
6Sergeant Sprinkles...Sir Sprinkles...
searched my name on google, there is another huffythemagicdragon onprincesstrollestia.tumblr.com
I thought the world already blew up from awesomeness from two Falcon Punches colliding
unless...that means the world exploded twice!
Hipster_Brony I'm here, a little late (2 days late) but I'm here. I have been having troubles contacting.
TWICE?!?!
RBD was telling us about the incident last night
6We're already discussing it, Metal.
albi the racist dragon
oh okay looks like I won't stupidly get confused about who wrote cupcakes then
Ah, I see
Reminds me of The Demented Cartoon Movie.
0Dave_Brozilla: It was remade, and re-destroyed by Gummy and Guile's theme
6We're waiting for more mods to get on.
We need to do this exact same thing with different GIFS, like Twilight clapping.
1 minute left!
So, like Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy?
"How many time did the world blow up now?" "I lost count"
no, it only works with gummy
0Dave_Brozilla: Exactly!
Guess Douglas Adams had it right all along
also, sprinkles, should we still interview Metal Link next week even with Sathi's app?
I'm still sorry ._.
10sent you a pm dude x
k
Or Pinkie running backwards.
10ghosties
6I think so, Hipster.
06Brees
/me back too
6Since Metal is trying to be a streamer.
running backwards like fat albert movie
6IIRC
he is
but
while I wait I will try to beat a rpg in 30 seconds, BRB
that smile on gummy is just slightly creepy
http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3487/130394362282.jpg <-- *snerk*
i dont know if we should hire 2 more mods
6We wouldn't.
he needs to learn to stick around for more than a couple seconds
6He'd just be next in line.
saw it b4 YAWN
6We won't need another streamer for a bit anyway.
one of these alligators drugged and raped the other
We all do, Espy.
EspyLacopa that's been out there for a while
and im pretty sure sathi is going to be the one we add
6Also, announcements time.
but thaknz still
0I just realized, Gummy took a bath with Twilight.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
why not just interview metal link when we do our next round of hiring then?

RainBroDash, yeah, that's how britains spell color
I see no such rule link above my chat window.
wait is there a steam group?
sometimes it's below
I just think Twilght saying "Spike, wake up it's Winter Wrap Up day!" Is fucking adoarble. I don't know why.
it depends on your browser
COLOUR
Watch how she loses the boots, saddle and scarf after the main theme
Bitch go back to sleep.
....Above my chat window, is the wall behind my computer.
COLOUR.

A few months too early.
Colour ftw.
Okay I'm back.
Hi European Bronies!

Hi there ^^

WHITE COLOUR IS BEST COLOUR
also, rarity is an awesome designer
white is all the colors
Elky Hi!!!
rascist
if you combine paint colors, you get shit brown
Hi Antartican bronies!
10Purple'Prose I guess not. that tends to be when DCD streams, and we've got SirSprinkles streaming
SPOILERS: ALL OF THEM
Good morning and/or afternoon and possibly evening to everyone.
'just slap different colours on it and it's cool!'
sad twilight scene makes me cry manly tears
White is my FAVOURITE colour!
10I guess ask sprinkles when he gets back from checking his bank balance
CAJ: The trick to remember is that with painting, the three primary colors aren't red, blue, and yellow, they're Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
Twilight sure can jump
Red is best colour
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand song time!
DAMN YOU WORK FOR MAKING ME LATE
Just in time for the greatest song EVER!
cept twi
4Dave: Red is best color
SONG

Yes it is, my dear Ghosties
Singing time
induring best verse

FUCK YES
0BEST SONG EVER COMING UP

10I KNOW IM SO FUNNY :3
how long did they spend rehursing this?
OLD
6I'll work on getting it for the future.
you're right dance1211 it's not racist; just as ignorant and short sighted as hating any large group for general and petty reasons; like spelling differences
aww
10oh shit
right
10fsagdfijgkiasdh
/me is bouncing in her seat
best verse
dace1211: All improv all the time
Was always a fan of beige, even after modern gaming tried to kill it through sheer overuse.
8DASH VERSE IS BEST VERSE
TWILIGHT VERSE IS BEST VERSE
10k
joking
anyone spot the pony santa costume in Ticket Master?
4Hmm
4Conflicting views
APPLE PONY IS BEST PONY
govva give it to ponies to randomly break out into song and know the words off by heart
Fluttershy verse is best verse
Me, Ignaesia :D
All verse is best verse.
0DR. WHOOVES VERSE IS BEST VERSE
:D
Long neck BonBon!
Rarity's part of Fluttershy's version is the best
Needs more Spike Verse.
all verse is best verse
Again, mod business stays mod buisness ;)
all verses are the best
THIS SONG WILL NEVER LEAVE MY HEAD!!!
...minus the kiss
that voice <3
10COLGATE >:3
lol
stupid emoticon
Brushie brushie
Hipster_Brony is in denial of the AJ verse
tgp: YOU NEED TO TYPE IN CAPS OR NOONE WILL UNDERSTAND YOU
Singing Shy is adorable.
This song will be playing after death.
0Agressive Brush tactics, GO!
Is it just me, or is Dash incredibly sexy in dat vest?
dr whooves
SPIKE MUST SING IN AN EPISODE
AJ ftw
10I love it
I was not posting in caps before it was cool
Bad news, Caramel's gonna lose the grass seeds.
At least this song doesn't get stuck in my head too bad, Ducktails on the other hand....
10and yeah yeah i just
AJ VERSE IS BEST VERSE NO MATTER WHAT HIPSTER_BRONY THINKS
Dr. Whooves is on every team. He has to research this important event.
10bleugh
6Gummy pony is best pony.
I s'pose it could be
10K :D
IronPoptart: And it must be suitably epic.
applejacks verse is worst verse
Also a new year's ep
spike is best pony
best part with rest for dramatic planting
Don't worry about it, just stay with the main room
Fluttershy is still best pony.
Dinky, I doth <3 you
AJ verse=best
Dinky Doo!
1
Spike must sing in season 2.
I wonder if sharp temp jumps accompany these manual season changes?
Eyes open, bro
I wonder if there is a Santa Pony.
its just that we dont want people knowing if our mod team is down a few people so they can try to break the rules
Same for Trollestia and Luna.
10It's spring!
Applejack's verse bugs me for one reason. She sounds like she's whining about having to work hard.
TGPFluttershy: *brohoof*
Wow, is that still Tara Strong singing there?
AJ and RBD have the best verses = they are sung by the same VA. Mind blown
see ya gaiz gotta go see ya next time hopefully
why can't twilight use magic?
Luna is supposed to be in S2.
"Tries to think of Santa horse pu*
Oh look, Hipster_brony is mad today too!
Pretty much
Nope.avi, IronPoptart
because then you have the whole "PC" crap to deal with
pun*
Hipster_Brony YOU CANNOT RUN FROM ME!
bye]
okay songs ever
dance1211: Because it's not traditional.
OR THE TRUTH
8HEIL TWILGIHT
holy shit, stop freaking out Firefox
*clopclopclop*
and privacy and all that jazz
ASw.
Because then everypony will get mad
we can turn the episode off now
*Aw.
Yes, Luna will be in S2, but the next question is if she will sing.
dance1211 because its tradition in ponyville
4Is it Heil?
11Sorry
4I said HIEL yesterday, I think
oh well, at least i didn't miss the audio
Twilight seriously considered joining the flight crew.
silly twilight
it's Heil
still love Twilight no matter the episode
4Fuck, IT'S RUINED
Sorry Twilight, you should know that you cant fly
I think it is hEIl
dem wings
FOREVER
it's heil
Poor Twilight :(
Well, she COULD use a spell to make wings...
spike gives no shit
Twilight needs to drink some red bull.
I am german, I have to know :S
10SRS BZNS
awww...
Winter Wrap Up SRS BZNS
I before E, except for C, and as in A as in weighing and neigh
WAIT--If Ponyville was founded by Earth ponies...how did they clear the sky without pegasi?
well actually tie between Twilight and Luna
SRS BSNS
SRS BSNS
Epic Spike trolling in this episode
0"Whats a birds nest?"
THIS IS- Dammit RainBroDash
where are you from soarin?
Too bad they don't sell red bull in Equestria
And then he gets trolled back.
Düsseldorf :3
I syphasize with spike
i stayed up all night and i'm tired as fuck
4IronPoptart: Food for thought indeed
8Spike troll is best troll
give Pinkie a red bull
inb4 spike is master troll
dang, all other german bronies live so far away from me
rarity, that nest looks like shit
Rarity's so OCD.
Twilight's bird nest breaks the rules of physics.
4ALL ORGANIZED :D
where you at, Elky?
And then Rarity killd everypony.
@IronPoptart obviously they used Pinkies crazy contraption
Oshit.
What is that monstrosity?!
dresden xD
Birds don't build nest, Ponies do it for them, dang nature class lied to me
OF COURSE
gee it's already 4 in the morning over here and still watching ponies
10CAJ: YOU'RE TOO SLOOOW
damn, ok :p
My eyes!
Nice outhouse by the way.
IronPoprart THEY SHOT AJ OUT OF A CANNON
10(bonus points for the piss-annoying reference if anyone gets it)
rarity doesn't give a shit
OUTHOUSE
Hah!
dat plot
Rarity plot.
RainBroDash Why...?
lol RainBroDash has anyone not played Brawl at this point/
\spike just bassicly suggested they shit in it
So well groomed.
You know-for kids!
dat ass wigglin
10>:3
TWINKIE PINKIE
Ice skating at the rock farm.
Notice how she keeps removing parts from the failed nest. . .but it never actually gets smaller.
awesome bgm here
RainBroDash: I'm leaning toward Disgaea, but they already reference other stuff.
Easy as Pinkie Pie.
This episode has an aggressive amount of plot.
infinite bird nest
Easy as a PINKIE pie! *rimshot*
But that was before Ezio took over the voice of Sonic
mmm....Pie
Anyone who hasn't played BRawl by now hates Nintendo with a passion, and they need to be condemned
pinkie is ice skating, this is helping winter why?
4CAJ: I didn't get the reference
Oh fuck I was late.
10Razyn I think you got it right by getting it wrong?
8FACEICE
Ghosties I am disappoint
it helps becuase pinkie is skating
actually, they make her skate so she's out of the way, the ice doesn't actually be broken
bambi reference?
10It was Brawl, but probably referenced on there
acutally you guys have fun I'm just going to go to sleep since it's really early in the day
8this is my fetish
What if we *played* Brawl, but really didn't care for it?
natural disaster
4Well, CAJ, that's, like, your opinion, man >:I
10ValtheJean then you win
*See's Pinkie skate for about 1-2 seconds*"You're the best skater I've ever seen!"
*Cough* MK9 *Cough
Well, you experienced it at least
I can clop to this
:D
10Because it was the worst Smash yet
Well, Spike is amused. Truely this was a victory for the forces of good.
besides, the skin hacks make it the best Smash ever
I <3 natural disasters.
Thanks Spike...
4TGPFluttershy is doing it right. MK9 YEAH!
what would a ice skating boot to the face feel like?
I heard that the majority of the pro community for SSB moved back to Melee
Daffy Duck voer Falco
I don't blame Twilight, Ice skating for the first time is tough
dat window
RainBroDash haters gonna hate
that would hurt
She grew up on a rock farm. No lakes.
6AAAAAAAAAAGH
6WINDOWS
I've always wondered if Twilight could use her telekinesis to make herself fly...
4Speaking of which, I have the new Kenshi wallpaper as my background
way to help the self esteem spike
Ghosties Is he worth the 5$?
*Cue adorable Fluttershy*
oh fail you are twilight
8DEM WINDOWS
4WINDOWS ARE INVADING THE STREAM
lol, it's just his way of getting revenge for all the slave labor
Snaaaake!
are you ready?
Spike is only in this episode to make douchey quips at Twilight. That isn't to say Spike isn't awesome.
"Really?" "No." Pinkie Pie, if you're going to lie to make your friend feel better about her terrible skating, you ought to stick to the lie for more than two seconds.
4And yes, TGPFluttershy, absolutely
....dammit Fluttershy, why are you so adorable?!
READY DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT
that is not cute at all
Am I still connected?
she may fail at some things but I still <3 Twilight
4Solid, balanced, good knockbacks and easy combos
Ghosties, How about Skarlet?
