Of course :)
12Well, there powerful, thin, and durable
The spammer had the same IP
12That, or a Gateway
I need to re-join all the other channels I"m supposed to be in -- my bouncer seems to glitch sometimes
dell makes good laptops if you're looking at laptops
yeah
he was banned or something a long time ago
12Yes, I am looking at laptops
i forget what for
03they aren't powerful at all
Oh also
12How so, drf?
Someone wants their account activated and can't get the activation text
03just the specs
03are not good whatsoever
Pfft
Powerful
Think he said he PMed you
03for like half the price you can get about twice the performance
1.6 Ghz core 2 duo
03^
ok.
^ True
it's right in the site help section
03my laptop has a 2.28GHz quad core ;p
Just get a Lenovo X1
03and it cost about as much as a Macbook sooooo
It is ULTRA THIN
03obviously mine's better
And powerful
03:P
03it has a dedicated graphics card too
I have a i3-330m
03NVIDIA 160M
03EW i3
EW NVidIA
EWWWWWWWWWW
03i5 and i7 are good, i3 is the most retarded piece of crap ever
ew ew
Heh
03EW ATI
03NVIDIA is awesome
03ATI for laptops = NO
03for desktops, maybe. For laptops, NO
Awesome at sucking YOUR BATTERY AWAY
:P
EW PREFERENTIAL BIAS
i use ati
on my laptop
So do I
i've used nvidia before though
I have a Nvidia 7900gs and a HD 4350 :P
03I've done tech support on laptops with ATI cards, and they ALL had driver and software problems
03All of them
03>_>
mine never has
lopl
03you're lucky.
lol it took him two days to realize that a spammer attacked the forum
Same with all my Nvidia carfd
s
you're unlucky
:p
horray for responsible admins
DRF is very unlucky :<
03if you had drivers issues with NVIDIA then you're doing it wrong
Nah
i've never had driver issues with any of the video cards i've used
12^
You can't go wrong with using a Nvidia Mobo with a NvidiaGPU
:>
hopy scheiße
Mhm
But I still got driver errors
;p
On Both computers with Nvidia
03LOL NVIDIA motherboards
(XP and EW VISTA)
03I use MSI motherboards
03those are awesome
I use Dell
And he doesn't seem to be doing anything about that member's account either
03yay military grade components?
So it's either Dell Mobos or Nvidia
Nah
12Some things apple makes are crappy though, like the iPad
03Correction
Yay basic consumer computers
nvidia doesn't make motherboards, they do, howeve, make onboard graphics
03Everything APple has made since the late 80s sucks.
meh
doubt it
03well, EVGA makes motherboards.
he'll just say he has better things to do
i've liked the apple products i've used
03I liked the original Macintosh

03EW CLICKWHEELS
12Or, blend it!

03That's the most retarded nativation system

He likes LAZ0R people too.
Amazing...buttons
03THe ZunePad is fricking awesome
and it's only because I'm a conservative
03it's like a scroll wheel,e xcept it actually makes sense
Don't those get dusty and broken XD

Wow.

I would imagine
03I'm about to leave so I never bothered to changed my nick
But he hates everyone
lol
:P
just like
03well, ew mp3 players that require you to use them for a long time in order to use it correctly
or just doesn't care

He never made any sense
03right, back to the fact of the matter, MacBook Air is possibly the worst laptop ever made.
^yer doing it wrong
That reminds me when someone sent you a PM on Valentine's day ages ago, oh the speculation.
^ SO R U

he's about business
Macy McFly
:D
Haha.
12Okay, I'll just spend more money on it, then it will be better :D
/me shot

MOO
I got a PM from someone on Neoseeker
03nope
*Noo
Years ago
Spend maor money on a real laptop
And showed it to spyrochat
And it'll be 100x better
!
03and seriously, if you have a huge budget, you can get some really good stuff
03get a Dell XPS, I actually kinda like Dell again now
03those things are insane
Like a gaming laptop :o
03they come stock with an i7
I have a dell XPS 700
Like a i7 which gets used 2% of the time.
03and like a NVIDIA dedicated card
That is from 2005 <3
03i7s FTW, don't be hating
i7s are fun
but you don't use it properly
12Actually, I don’t have the ‘best’ budget. But a pretty good one
03why, just because I have hyperthreading?
Till the other i7 users hate on you
not only that
was it just some random person or something?
;D
03well how much are you looking to spend?
it was anonymous
orly
we were all trying to figure out who it was
because you don't use the cpu much, either
there was a riddle
12Around $800
03you can't get ANY Macbook for that price
did you ever figure it out?
12More then likely
Yeah
03right either way
03I'm going now
03bbl
It was someone called Black Falcon
that I used to talk to in the HTML section
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/products/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1/index.html < Just get this :D
It has.. USB 3.0
12drf wins again :P
Well you eat owls AND cats
So you have no right to talk
And dogs.
:P
And squirrels.
And anything that moves.
I eat cows and deer!
Bai
And baaww
I eat ponies
:O

How could you?!
That is around 1400$
:P
Too far! :P

speaking of cows
there is one cooking as we speak
12lol
waiting to be eaten
Speak ing of cows...Your mum
HAHAHAHA
shuddup
I'm so funny.
12I actually would, but I don’t have a job yet
My mom isn't a cow, dari :'(
sadface.png
LOL
She's cow that's being cooked and waiting to be eaten.
I think that was directed at me, and my mom isn't either
Sadness on any colour, no compromises
+a*
;D
whats the THICKNESS!
03before I go
03the only thing I don't like about that ThinkPad
03is that you have to get a SSD
03As much as that's cool
03I'd rather have like a 500GB normal hard drive
03XDC
03-C
03that and 13.3" is kinda small
03if they made a 15" version
03I'd so want one
You mean you'd rather smash it on the ground AND lose data?
03LOL
03no
drf: 13.3" is not small. :P
LolSSD/
03for me it is
0315.4" is ideal for laptops
03IMHO
An Osborne I with it's... what 5" screen is small. :P
I'm 1.3 in off :P
thats because you intend to turn any laptop into a media hub. which they aren't
03no
But Junh..
03that's because I like being able to see the screen without straining my eyes
My laptop IS my media hub
03the ability to watch high def videos is also aplus :P
12I like 0.1 size screens :D
i was referring to the HD
I rarely use my PC anymore
XD
durf
i use a 17"
i love it
03anyway
but i've used a 10.1 and it was okay enough
03NOW bbl
I prefer my PC to a laptop.
02No drf
02Never
/me is laying on his island counter using his laptop
Mostly becuase laptops melt under the requirement of virtualizing three systems as once. :P

12On my PC, I have a 20" screen
-he should seirously just sell the site
I have a 23in screen and a 17in one XD
Mine's 21" I believe.
And... if I wish to, I have a nice 40" screen beside me. :P
Lols
I just need a HDMI cable to hook my PC up to my 52in TV
Hah. My TV uses normal DVI (thank God).
:<
EW HDMI
Though it has VGA, and HDMI.
DVI-D is awesome
And RJ45 Ethernet. :P
(Why yes, it CAN watch video streams... if I had it plugged into the Ethertubes.)
12My TV is only 18.5” :<
/me picks up Emmi
12There’s a 30 inch TV in the living room though
why does my brother have an alarm going off at 4:30 in the afternoon? o.O
Ask him.
Nice
I can't. :P
EW Eternet
:P
I have a Blu-ray player with that
XD
And more importantly, how do I turn it off?
break it with a hammer
I like RDX's idea.
then buy him a new one? No thanks

*shot*
13Goodnight Xeli :3
But he was in the basement playing video games
that's where I should be
I love that scene so much.
13So I was thinking to myself what it would be like if I decided to be mute around my friends for all of next week
13or just see how long I'd last without speaking xD
AE
You will have no more friends after that
After Effects
/me hides
They'll think of you as a "Mute lunatic"
Like Chell
;D
13Well if I told them beforehand that I was trying to stay silent for as long as I could xD
13and I could still reply via written notes :B
Cell can write
But nobody likes her XD
yeaabut that's not quite the same
It's true ;3
13Since I don't know who Chell is, I don't really care :P
Portal girl
:<
13I doubt I'll last long though, I'll probably end up forgetting by accident and respond to someone without realising |D
/me doesn't have any interest in Portal
13:B
Heh
Boring

Lunatic

02OH YES YOU DO ESPY :U
02I mean...

02It's ok Espy, we all have our (weird) differences :3
13LOL

Do eet
I've already been teased enough in my depressing life
02Ok, so a duck walked into a bar...
It won't make a difference </optimism>
02That's the spirit HML!
13You know, I'm not a mean person and believe it or not I actually care about how everyone feels
13Unless I honestly seriously hate someone
13but that's very rare :B
02I love you too Espy
You're a good person <3

Ah yes, "Ponies." A hoofed race of mammals that teach us about the importance of friendship and have delightful adventures. We have dismissed that claim.
I'm Death Pony! Aw, the poor horse can't hear.
My little pony, my little pony.
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
oh no
My little pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be
My little pony
He's going to sing the theme song
I HATE ALL OF YOU
I'M EMO NOW
Until you all shared its magic with me
I never thought I'd know what friendship could be or something along those lines
Big adventures
Tons of fun
/me passes out..
/me still never watches the theme song
A beautiful heart, faithful and strong
Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat
4I never watched the opening
And magic makes it all complete
Chas
COME TO IRC NAO
You have my little pony
4I think if my parents walked in, they would assume I was gay
the instant she signed in
Do you know you're all my very best friends?

I shouldn't have clicked that link
need creeper dust to fire master spark
why?
that line may be the greatest thing ever said
Now my dad is going to look at my history and think I visit some 4chan like site
yo
oh
:o
Whoops.
6and I have no clue why
oh well
It's only one link though.
4pft 4chan
SSSSSSSSS LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVEBEAM
yeah
6lolololololol
yeah, not like it's in your bookmarks or anything
Makes me wonder how she's using it in Blazing Star.. OOPS
I don't care what SR says about it
I'm pretty sure my dad can see my browsing history
oh yeah
what did SR say?
4Delete it?
It's impossible
you can't delete it
4Flee for the hills?
you can clear it
There's no way you could see it through the router
but anyone who can access a router can get it
I could clear it from my computer, but that would do nothing
It would already be in the access log or whatever
do yourself a favor and don't do anything SR says
it's either BS or illegal
Heya Rora
and SR said that's bs?
He said there would be no way anyone could see the websites I've been to through the router
yeah right
without actually going to my computer and looking at my history
if you have wireshark you could do it
What makeyou think your dad can anyway?
by seeing where the packets are coming and going
makes*
You could unlpug the router, might clear temporary memory.
back
he'd probably notice
not a big deal though
02wb
just one image
Yeah
worst that could happen is he blocks 413chan
Confound these ponies, they drive me to drink.

Confound these ponies, they drive me to drink Coke

I drank Coke before ponies
I hate you
does this make me a caffeineaholic?
Probably
So RDX likes ponies?
well crap
That's why he drinks so muhc coke.
I'll take you to Cokeaholics Anonymous if you want
He doesn't but his business forces him to wear pony shirts to work everyday
Am I seeing things?

it said the server died or something
you guys are looking at too much porn

Does it have adblock plus that actually blocks the ad scripts instead of just making them invisible?
Won't use it if not
4No idea
4But I enver got any problems
I've gotten too many viruses from ads
4oh
4then nvm
4you need a good anti-virus
I have to have Mcafee
For school
Or I can't get online
I think your computer has AIDS.
4Dude
It makes you more susceptible to malware.
4Mcafee sucks
I know
/me spins around everyone
Mcafee is probably what's using half my computer's memory
I'm using Trend Micro right now
4Get Trend Micro
Can't
Or I could for 3 months
Kaspersky was good but it uses too much CPU
then I'd just have to get rid of it again when I go back to school
4Why do they make you use it?
becuase they have contracts with the companies
to promote and use their shit services
Because the help desk is completly incompetent with computers and thinks Mcafee is automatically better than AVG because it's "not free"
-__-
their network doesn't let you on unless you fit their requirements
And probably what RDX said
XD
Old song
bored ?
hehe
yes I
Got mine straight from the source
I am here to save the day from boredom

Because firefox is retarded and saved my tabs
From when my computer crashed
Oh, I thought it was because your dad would go "BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBAN".
Get chrome.
nah, it's because I don't want to get another bluescreen
Chrome is good.
I have Chrome
But again, the adblock thing
chrome asks if you want to reopen the closed tabs
yeah, the adblock is dumb
Adblock thing?
What about it?
Yeah, like I was saying before
4meow
I heard the newest version of Chrome's adblock is like the firefox one though
what is this i dont even
Chrome's adblock doesn't block the scripts, only the images of the ads
like it actually blocks the ads instead of hiding them
Ooh, British Derpy.

You could just not be lazy and update your hosts file. :P

You can redirect sites to localhost.
So if something tries to load them, it won't load.

For firefox not loading the tabs I mean
gonna go watch some music award show
be back later
that seems like a serious design flaw to me
I agree
I prefer how Chrome asks
yeah
Firefox should do that
stupid Mozilla :P
I'm sure you can specify in Firefox's options somewhere.
well yes
but to get to the options, I have to open firefox

Barowl is talking about food again. :/
You guy should make an IRC channel for your forum. Bring some people to the network.
We could do with some more people.
Yeah, but no one there is actually entertaining to talk to unless they're being trolled.
I wouldn't want to bring a bunch of noobs/immature kids to the network.
Excluding myself, of course. :P
Still, it might help spread the word around
And the noobs would probably only stay in the one channel anyway
As long as they were contained I suppose it can't hurt.
But how to advertise, seeing as it's forbidden to do publicly...
just to pitch in
They won't be able to work out how join other cahnnels.
I agree that you should try getting it
a channel for OFF
Talk to the forum admin
See if you can make it the official channel so it's OK to advertise
I would be a member of this new channel for sure

Hello, owlpages. There's been some interest among active members of the forum about creating an IRC channel that would work in conjunction with Owl Fantasy. It'd solve some of the problems of off-topic posting and the cluttering up of Open Discussion. If you think it's worth a try I can set a channel up with the help of some professional friends who host a s

server on IRC. I feel that it might be mutually beneficial in that it would spread word about the forum while at the same time generating attention for the server itself. Is this something you'd approve of?

Heya Rora

Roara
Have you seen a doctor for the swallowing problem?
I was worried about that
I literally just woke up, I haven't even gotten out of bed
I just grabbed the laptop
um, no not yet
I'm actually giving it another day or so
this morning it seems to be beter
Hmmm
Good to hear but
I'm trying to think of all the things I ate this weekend, i wonder if maybe it was food allergy
or something
Do see a doctor soon
Could be
Peanuts?
6no, if it's a food allergy, it's new. I've never been allergic to food
6no I aven't had peanuts
hmmm
6can air allergens cause throat prblems?
6maybe it wasn't food at all
anyway bedtime soon for me
Could be Roara
Have you been somewhere dusty?
6lol my whole hometown
6is farmland
6everyone here has allergies
Ack
Nasty
6even if you dont naturally have them, you get them by living here
6I just recently developed allergies 5 years ago
Ouch
I have no allergies as far as I know
Which is lucky for me
I can eat practically anything
there is risk of Q-Fever in my town :?
*:/
Though I'm sensitive to strong smells
Cigarette smoke, alcohol fumes, chemical smells, etc.
6same to all of that
6I'm starting to think this may be allergies..
6thing is, my allergies kick up late march-mid april
6and they didn't this year
Hmmm
06o.o
6I went through maybe 4 days of it
Whatever it is, do see a doctor soon
6and then I was fine
6yeh I'll let it go another day, if it's like this toimorrow
6I'm going to mention it
6that's the most successful way to get me to stop eating so much lol
heh
Meh, most of my alleriges are acting up too x.x
6I also have an itchy nose this morning
6so possibly
anyway

07yup
/me eeps :3
I think that Ziamber guy is a troll
prolly
SR said he was posting Osama bin Laden gore in people's guestbooks
the accoutn was made last year
was he now
Apparently
well if SR knows this why doesn't he do shit about it
He gave him a warning
And said to ban him if he does anything else
alright if that's what he wants but just about every post he makes is trolling
Can't tell if he's trolling or just annoying
6hmm
/me gives kyu a kyu snack
prolly both
6why don't we own Speed D:
6we always watch it when it happens to be on TV
6but wth
12it's like a scooby snack except it's a kyu snack
ovallue was the only real intelligent troll we had
03LOL
03I own the deluxe collector's set of Speed
03as well as the Blu-Ray
03u jelly?

03I wonder if you can still get that DVD set
/me looks
02whee Nick Alert
02I also I forgot that I was connected

If you look back on his posts it's totally obvious, but back then I didn't know trolls did stuff like that
well he actually made the effort to somewhat gain the respect of the community before revealing his true colors
02Well, actualy..
Waste of time if you ask me
not to them it isn't
Nick alert sounds when I'm around!

03what money
lmfao
13Ray needs to procrastinate moar
02NUUUUU.
02Homework, now.
6I'm the best procrastinator ever
6mainly because I only work under pressure
03XD
02Aurora vs Angel. GOD tier fight
World's longest battle?
13^
6ok well
6I can't beat that
6my work always gets done
02^
6I just procrastinate literally up to the last possible minute
13I give myself a time to start working, then I say "I'll do it in half an hour"
02Then again, ^
6see
13then eventually I either end up not doing it at all, or I find myself starting my work at midnight or something |D
6we got a huge art prject in my 2d design class
6to make a nature study book
6from scratch, complete with layout, hand drawn images, research, cover, binding, everything
6she gave us a month and a half
6I started two pages, out of 24
6didn't finish them, only did minimal layout for credit
6did the entire thing within 3 days of turning it in
Hahaha, I used to do the same with all school projects.
amazing that we still take care of this site anyways
6I always do this lol
Always waited for the last minute; always aimed for the minimum.
13I didn't finish ANY of my projects for Art GCSE
13my teacher kept telling me I was gonna fail
13yet I still passed with a C :B
It would be complete trash if someone didn
*didn't
03usually I just end up failing ;.;
6manly, you're in monterey right?
Santa Cruz.
all that spam from three days ago would still be there
Across the bay, lol.
6...close enough lol, but nvm then
6I was gonna ask what school you went to
I have no idea why care though =/
well it's a good thing you were there to take care of it
6but lol nvm
eh
I guess because of the memories
/me does homework
Nah. I was born in Moneterey, but I moved to a little town about 10 miles east of there.
6what town?
Yeah, I guess
6salinas- wait no that's further
Castroville. "Articoke Center of the World."
hard to let go of something after 6 years
6LOL CASTROVILLE
Yeah.
6I love that place
6because artichokes
It's so small, though! xD
6fields upon fields upon fields
6I know lololol that's why it's awesome
6its practically non existant
6I thought hollister was bad enough
Pretty much, haha.
well
maybe the kid in me still enjoys the memory of Spyro lol
6speaking of santa cruz though
6I seriously need to go to the boardwalk sometime soon
6I usually go like 6-9 times a summer
6didn't go AT ALL last year
6strike that, went once
6as a spur of the moment
It's a fun place.
I'm trying to get a job there.
6how was the 30 thousand+ people at the concert a couple weeks ago lol
But it's so hard since so many people are trying to do the same. lol
yeah, that too
Wait, how do you know about that? xD
6dude
but I'm getting really sick of this blandness
6 30 thousand people in santa cruz
too bad they're making this Skylanders stuff now
6everyone within 50 miles knows about that
Because games aren't made that well any more.
I really have no interest in that
neither do I
6that was over double what people were saying was going to happen
@pony
I never heard about a concert here. Dang, I live in a bubble.
Whoo. (:
6.......LOL
Now I'm googling it, cause I seriously didn't know about any concert.
that and the blandess of the site
it needs a makeover
SR likes you
Just get him to make you an admin
Easy, right? :P
RDX's face when I come on and talk about ponies: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130569271562.gif
LOL
haha
yeah right
6I guess everyone thought for sure he'd make the top three,
I'll just up and ask him for the hell of it
6but he got sent home as the 4th
6they had the concert anyways
I haven't talked to him in a few months
6just no filming
6I'm willing to bet the majority of that crowd thought for sure the film crews would be there
He was planning on getting some old Spyro site and redirecting it to SF I think.
For more traffic.
Yeah, SFA
I don't know why he'd bother, though
It's just an old proboards site
what site?
He said it still gets a fair amount of unique traffic.
Spyro fans anonymous
oh that old thing
didn't know people still used it
http://spyro.conforums3.com/
Finished watching through all the MLP episodes for the second time. :P
the most recent post was last week
lol
Yeah, lots of unique traffic there
/me hugs Kitten and Emmi
Oh, so the concert was at the Boardwalk. I feel stupid. No one ever said anything about that. xD
Just because people don't post there doesn't mean it isn't getting traffic.
216 members
6really
They probably see it's pretty dead and leave.
6I thought that many people would be hard to miss
6even in santa cruz LOL
well that's all well and good but we still need some changes
bring money into it somehow and SR will be interested
maybe we could buy it from him or something
eh
I don't know
And I could see the Boardwalk from outside my house, too. I was probably working... or really tired. lol
last I talked to him about that he said he would never sell it
Dreading any fans brought in by Skylanders, there'd have to be something wrong with them if that's what got them interested in 'Spyro'.
6loool
well as much as I don't like this Skylanders junk if it can bring some acitivity to the forum I'm all for it
As long as it's not all little kids like LoS brought us
Ugh, that was annoying
If you bought it from him you'd have to pay for hosting though.
Well, yeah. Hopefully I can get a job at the Boardwalk so I wouldn't miss those type of things anymore, haha.
Except for you, RDX
well it will prolly still be kids since it involves Toys
lol
You were like the only non-annoying member to join during that time XD
eh I had my moments
03woah
03one of my mom's friends has tickets to be in the pit of a NASCAR race
at least the Forum had more mature members then
03and he's offering them to me
to counter balance the stupidity
I didn't think of that
What happened to all our activity...?
there hasn't been a new Spyro game in years
6omg do it
03yeah
So no one cares about it anymore
Hm.
03my mom's calling the guy right now
03making sure the offer is still good
03he has two tickets, so I can take a friend
Same could be said for forum updates
6manly, do it and i can totally come visit
/me 6runs
Nothing new has happened in ages
The Spyro film might have been useful for new members if they hadn't canceled it.
03I might try to sneak in my HD camcorder XD
I'll give discounts for people who visit me. lmfao
he is too stubborn to change anything about the site
it's still running off the old phpbb
I still have a hard time believing it was real
the movie I mean
Lol.
Did they ever even make a trailer?
no
I dont' think so
03yay, Welcome to Detroit is on the radio
But from a financial standpoint
03I fricking love this song
03It was my favorite for like
03a year
Who in their right mind would think that would be a good idea?
They made a poster for it.
it was about as real as Jamique or whatever his name was
yeah
But for Spyro?
Very few have actually been completed though.
which was such a load of bullshit it wasn't funny
Spyro isn't popular at all anymore
And those that were failed.
No one would watch it
Mostly.
Yeah, jamique was super annoying
03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/tumblr_lka3tcdsql1qa0uujo1_500.jpg <- I love this song too
The only reason why I thought it might have been real at one point was because the developers of the game said it was being made
03but not quite sure why it was necessary to make it into a picture
03especially since they mixed the order up LOL
He got pissed and started whining at me through PMs when I locked his thread
he was just an attention seeking con artist
led people on about that shit for five years
I've got further than he did in a couple days. :P
yep you have
Oh, but he's so busy! Give him a break!
the most he had to show was a couple of really shitty looking drawings
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ground-zero-ad-fail.jpg
You're putting too much pressure on him!
if he was the head of game development then I felt bad for the game
6that picture is HORRIBLE LOL
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ad-fail.jpg
03that is awesome
I don't give a shit if SR still wants to own the site and all that but he needs to at least get someone who will always be around to deal with the bigger issues then a mod can handle
Yeah, like at least that registration thing
that's bullshit that he put that in anyways
Red...Cupcake.
NOT WANT!
D:
lol Ratchet is part of that forum
SFA?
yeah
haha
Thos pictures. lmfao
or at least he was active on it at one point
Does TTE even do anything anymore?
and WOW they actually got images for their freaking ranks
http://i56.tinypic.com/14jrr42.jpg
TTE?
Admin of SFA
a proboard admin has more initiative then ours
Oh.
LOOOOOOOL
Epic troll
He shut down the site because he was mad about ANB
LOL.
6lololol
Jackson117 is part of it too
Epic rage quit.
That guy is annoying
lol
6I love that sign in the back
I found a post by TTE
it says
6"come see us may 22nd"
Cynder is a "censored"
LOL
03XD
wow
Hahaha. XD
I was around when SFA got shut down and all the members started migrating to SF
oh btw that last post two weeks ago was just an advertisement bot
I think that's actually where ratchet came from
Do either of you go on DS, how are they doing in comparison with SF?
Hah, fai;
*fail
eh
I don't go on there much
DarkSpyro is really active
But all the activity is crap
Active with morons
but still active
...So why are we doing so badly?
because they can do whatever they want there
02Lmfao Manly
they dont' have mods
Oh.
Fail.
and an admin just as lazy as SR
simply put
I like the way the site is set up
Most Spyro fans seem to be around 9 to 14
it's just run like shit
"We could buy the site off SR" - this is starting to sound like plotting revolution again. XD
LOL
Haha, no thanks
I missed the first revolution
^ Same.
Wait what?
I just heard about it.
You missed both of them
I think
Both?
yeah
There were two?
oh yeah
forgot you had two
yeah
I got there just after the second one
We were drama queens
Doppel lead the first one right?
No
Oh.
The first one was in like '07
I pretty much lead both of them -.-
Hahaha. XD
while trying to date SR at the same time :P
Shut it :P
XD
Lawl.
So was Doppel on your side, or what?
Doppel joined after both of them
I think he tried to start a third one, but it didn't work out
O__o
Can't remember when I joined.
I think I used the IRC for about a year before I made an account.
you just joined randomly one day when we pushed you to do it lol
03well
03I gotta go work out at the gym now
03so bbl
*plays Punch Out/Rocky music*
03XD
And I guess you could count Zekira
03yeah anyway
Oh, so I missed both of them?
yeah
Aww, all the drama.
If you joined around when #spyrochat was made, you missed them both
Damn the history of SF is colourful.
Haha, it's even better when you throw the stuff about LoneKnight in
Lol.
He was involved in both
Trying to get us to stop
he was gone before I shoed up
XD
then we've got Razz
LOL RAZZ
Oh God
I forgot about that
lol
Razz artist is best artist.
Worship plzl.
well she had the personality of a toothpick
but at least she attracted people to the forum
Why did she leave? XD
yeah, annoying Razztards who attack if you say one negative thing about her
People stopped worshipping her?
ehhehhehe
she and SR had a falling out
4Sup peeps
She was picking on DDR in a thread
I went a little too far standing up for him
it was all blown out of proportion
She got really offended and announced that she was leaving everywhere
Lawl.
4wiat what
Razztards - rise UP!
4who?
We're talking about Razz
Going through the history of SF
4Oh
4She overcharges her commisions on DA. Not even that good
that's how she makes her living
sure as hell can't do anything else
cept dress up at those freaking comic cons or whatever
*GASP* RDX insulted blind people!!
Lol.
oh darn
RAZZTARDS ATTACK!
4Pass
it was all blown out of proportion
then fucking Spyro tried to attack me for doing my job
he hasn't been back since
4I saw him back once a few months ago
4Spyro is a dip
4really, he is
He has a life
yeah he tried to attack me when I was describing what happened with Razz to somebody else
Don't question why he's gone
He is so busy and has a life
he runs a campground
that's living?
hell I'll take my job
4Speaking of life
4I'm actually making a full recovery
4should be 100% in Sept
Oh, I thought you were going to say you were pregnant.
:P
good to know
that's great
:)
yes yes
4anyway
so yeah we all know SF is fucked up
4DUH
4I'm not a mod
lol it says you are
4for fucking RP. That part can die
4Nothing i say or do makes them smarten up
nothing we say does either lol
I'll talk to SR and find out what's up
4Pft
4Good luck getting him to respond
I know how to make him talk
4Sweet nothings?
hahaha, that sounded evil
it's easy
You want free l4z0rz and money?
just start the convo with either something insulting Liberals or Lazors
lol
4lmao
or yes Dari, money
XD
I have a great business oportunity for you. It involves shining lasers in the eyes of liberals
LOL
4Oh and giving me the site
eh last I checked he was gonna pay me money to get him some hosting opportunities
lol
Once he offered to pay me to make images for some scam he was doing
Scam? Wut?
one of those stupid texting things
Oh. >___>
04nyaa
"enter your phone number here to find out who your crush is!"
Wow.
4lol
4Fail
Then they keep texting you and steal your money
I have to say though, if you're gunna go for something like that, I'm not surprised you get your money stolen.
I guess it's worth it for the few people who buy into it
well, worth it if you don't care about making money in an ethical way
/me wants next series of ponies.
Episode with Derpy. :D
Would suck if they ruined her though.
There's not really anything to ruin
outside of the personality fanfiction has probably given her
They could call her Ditzy Doo. :/
they probably will
Lauren said the name could be Derpy if people wanted. D:
"Derpy" wouldn't make sense to the average 7 year old girl
Meh.
btw whoever changed the topic will suffer
who was it
You were there...
huh?
You suggested it in face. :P
You mean where it said "EVIL DOER!"
I wasn't paying attention
fact*
sarcasm no longer has a place in this world
Yeah, you were the one who told me to change it
because your link was broken
it still is, by the way
I know it is
It opens "draconicwolves.com!!"
Rawr.
Idc if it works or not on here really
But what was wrong with 4EVIL DOER! ?
Is anyone here?
:(
nothing was they're just obssessed with ponies now
no
/me hides
Ponies? what?
X3
10Hi RJ
Hey :3
The topic had nothing to do with ponies XD
PONY CHAT
Or at least last time I looked
Oh really
XD
Lol.
06=o
06hi
most likely
Heya RJ
Hi RJ!
Probably happened after my internet went off
/me pony bombs draconicwolves.
Hi :3
*glomps*
X3
/me is glomped
Hey GL :3
/me turns into a pony
13ohai RJ :3
Hey Espy :3
what has the world come to
Ponies, clearly.
XD
If you'd just give them a chance RDX. :P
That's as likely to happen as RDX trying Skylanders
Hahaha.
HML, I know you're going to kill me, but I switched over to FireFox.
12Yay
X3
Die
Why not Chrome
12FireFox shows web pages how they are really look~
12are-
Chrome shows the pages at a nicer Res and there is less scrolling
U mad?
Don't care.
(EW 1000 toolbars)
Yes you do
You're such a fool!
Now you're going to crash
I bloced ads with FireFox.
*blocked
I blocked ads with Chrome
:>
FireFox is the same XP
Firefox is just a slower (way slower) reasource hog of a ripoff
12I've used Chrome before, it is good, but it don't have that really good firewall FireFox has
Who needs firewalls?
I don't
12lol
I do.
IF you have proper AV
;p
(I use chrome with NO protection at all lol)
And no viruses yet :>
12If you like your computer you need one XD
I only have McAfee.
So I need one3
I love my computer
*X3
And I don't have one
But baw2U
Meh.
...
Lawl.
13How about this
12HML, most viruses hide on your computer and just slow it down.
13No one cares
13:3
Why not change the link?
Espy X3
Since it doesn't work.
/me seconds Espy
/me does, too.
Because RDX will just change it back anyway
Why?
I dunno
http://blog.gadodia.net/google-chrome-vs-mozilla-firefox/
And my lapto
p
Isn't slow
And I scan
But nothing comes up
/me yawns
Opinions, right Espeon :P
06Yes.
(Still can't argue with the facts lol)
Have you even tried chrome RJ?
Yeah.
12Also, it's up to you how many toolbars you have on FireFox
Not really
06One can avoid most viruses by just not being naive and stupid
Didn't like it.
It will always
13If it's opinions, why do you keep acting like yours is superior?
^
I have no toolbars.
13Discuss something else, this topic's boring me :B

/Trollestiaface

I had a dream about tiny kittens the size of mice
No idea why
But not ponies

Haha.

Were they strawberry cheesecake cupcakes?
Unfortunately not dreams of ponies last night.

/me glomps back

nope I don't cross that line
Well, I'm straight, anyway.
/me is tired x-x
X3
:P
And if you'd watched MLP, you'd know that ponies are manly.
4Manly men with hair balls
I'll take my chances
My dog is messing up my bed again,
XP
RDX is just scared that he'll like it.
my personal preferences do not revolve around ponies I'm afraid
that's what everyone says
02:P
then they watch it
13I read that as "my dog is messed up in the head again"
13o-o
:P
oi
The_People had to demand that he watch it.
X3
I'll be back in a bit
I bet he's gone off to watch ponies.
Aww
Trololo.
The reason he messed up my bed is because he was scared of the thunder XP
More like hiding from the ponies
You can only hide for so long...
LOL.
Fluttershy sounds as though she wants to eat you in the French MLP intro.
o.o
And they say "Mai lidl powny".
lol
It's weird.
03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all

04This is an awesome start to the day XD
04Hey Sky
04MANLY
Drake is hyper
10What is?
04HI
awesome start yo
lol
04I don't have to go to school
X3
And your WB message. xD
damn that'd be an awesome start too
04Because since my sister only has one class today, mum decided to let me stay home as well.
04Yeah
04XD
I don't think the voices sound as good in any of the other intros.
04Hey Manly
04Good news
04I don't have to go to school today 8D
Aren't you lucky
04Yes I am XD
10Slackerz
French, Quebec, Greek, Mexican, Dutch, etc.
/me finished her school in 45 minutes... X3
04I'm glad because we have this Mass at school and it'd be boring.
04XD
Why's that? lol
Hey don't blame me because I like to procrastinate
For one of them Rarity sounds like someone trying to putting on a really husky voice.
I only had a few quick lessons oday.
And I was rushing.
X3
04Since my sister only has one class today and she can come home when she's finished (she has her liscence now) mum let me have the day off
04XD
04Ditto
10Ew that word, I had to watch a bunch of people brag about how big of a procrastinator they are
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDQi0n-0zxk
The Greek one.
6lol let you?
6that's awesome
04Yup
10no one cares gaiz :P
04lol
04Procrastinating is awesome.
13wb Roara o3o

Your parents.
They cheat.

Better than me saying I'm an expert in procrastobation
/me uuughs

10Procrastinating while masturbating, right?
p much
oh M G!
/me is good at guessing games
I had the day off today from work. But... I never know what to do with my time.
there is a Justin Bieber Movie on PPV
So I end up doing nothing because there's so much I want to do. xD
That was a tough one too, wasn't it sky
very very hard indeed
10Yes, I was almost too afraid to answer
04Heh. Well, I make the most of my time.
/me goes and farms for Hrd Armor Spheres in MH3
04I finally got my Rathian+ armor, so yay!
lol
I shouldn't have used that Agnaktor avatar. lmfao

6this morning my brother yelled at me
6saying he hated me and my other brother
6I was so tired I didn't even notice lol
04o-o
04That's harsh
6yeah he as attitude priblems
04h-uh
6but first off, they know that if I'm woken up before 8:30, I'm horrible
6second, they woke me up because they were fighting
04Dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuun
6apparently one of them kicked the other, and it escalated
6so I walked out to shut them up
6thats how our mornings go around here
6I went back to bed lol
04lol
04Once I'm woken up, I can never get back to sleep.
04So I just make the most of my time and lie in bed with my eyes closed.

6profile or avatar?
13Profile :B
/me is fickle with things, if you've noticed
6lol
FICKLE
Ew that word
"Romeo was very fickle"
10HML is a fickle pickle
13I don't think I'd have the motivation to change mine any time soon, it took me forever to get it to how it is now =w=
Altair
6I change it every now and then
6little bits
6but it stays the same for the most part
why the FUCK do you have peerblock running?
that thing keeps blocking the BNC connections >:U
/me stalks Roara's profile
Makes me want to make my profile all white and yellow.
6lolol
13Also, have you seen what my current desktop wallpaper is yet? xD

	raht iaho

	gniod uoy er'woh
	esrever tihso
we need to whitelist those ports that it requires
actually one sec
/me died again.
Yeah,
13then again, there's quite a number of people who I remember used to be quite active then disappeared
Yeah, XP
13Like Jet The Latios
Same here
13he only joined back in December or something
13o-o
I wondered..
He's gone?
Yeah :<
Aw,
13He came here regularly, but overall wasn't around for long
13just stopped showing up o-o
He was my friend.
Even though we rarely talked XP
RJ :3
Lati :3
13I'd feel like a bad person if I said what I honestly thought about him, but he was a nice person to talk to :B
Altair lolj
lol*
connecting to BNCs is fine
I haven't seen jet in forever
13then again I ALWAYS feel bad if I find that something about a person bugs me, even if it's just something small |D
but we have several servers
lol
XP
I got another new server from leaseweb this time
and peerblock blocked the BNC connection
:|
Eh, my friend bugs me a lot, but she's still my friend XP
heh, but why ARE you running that anyway?
rofl
;)
13But does she guilt trip you into doing things for her?
13:<
I hate you )';
Yes X3
also
I got sacred back
not intentional but trolololo
:3
She made me draw so many pictures XP
and I have another server from leaseweb
which has 5 IPs ;x
:O
and 1GB of RAM
13I tend not to draw pictures for people unless I'm in the mood for a lot of drawing
13which is rare these days
13xD
I haven't decided whether to host a shadow on that or on the vps247 one
X3
/me needs to find out how you get all of these for free
they're my friend's ;3
13Of course, you should already know about that :3
Ahh
I kind of like drawing for her, though.
he bought all of them
:3
and I'm like "wat"
and I'm allowed to use them because I'm setting up his IRC network for him ;x
She gives me drawings that test my skills.
I like that.
the leaseweb one is in the netherlands rofl
o_o
wekk'
*well
10Bleh, tornado sirens
>:
o_O
Test hopefully?
10No
10Bad weather warning
10on TV and radio
13Jet made me feel like I was being pressured to draw something, otherwise I'd feel like a bad person if I didn't
Oh :\
13and always called me his bestie even though I barely knew him
I think the vps247 is in the UK or some shit like that
13I feel bad about thinking those things about him though, so ^^;
X3
I'm probably going to put shadow on that one as it has ipv6
He liked me X3
I'm not sure about the leaseweb one
It looks like it has ipv6 but I really don't know
10o.o
I don't see why.
Everyone has different opinions.
Speaking out your opinion isn't bad lol
13I can't help but feel like my kindness was being taken advantage of though :<
>:
:(
13It's happened to me a lot of times in the past by other people
Skyla your vhost has been activate
d
13but meh, that's in the past so xD
ty
derp
Eh, my friend knows I can't pass up a drawing request.
13A lot of people know that I find it really hard to say no to requests in general :<
And stopped trusting
O.o
Well not really stopped being nice
13I'd love to be more straight to the point sometimes, but I seem to have a fear of being disliked by people >:/
13I often go out of my way to please others and be liked by everyone
Be right back.
Well, I used to do that
brb
But people betrayed me and often told others what I told them
k
13Yeah, I only really trust a few people
Betrayal! Great betrayal!
13but pretty much anyone could probably guilt trip me into doing something for them if they tried, sadly >:/
I'm lucky that I have such great friends these days, like Drake, Xeli, Altair, etc. etc.
Because I know they're the people I can really trust, and I do
/rant
:P
Oh, BTW I got converted, I'm a brony now.
._.
10Ffuuu storm killed the power
o.o
FUUU
1075 mph wind
Well, I stopped feeling guilty
13LOL, another one
Ouch
x.x
I don't know when but I stopped regretting anything I did
I can acknowledge what I did was wrong but I don't really feel "guilty" for it
and lol you
10My neighbours... they're dancing in the rain
Back.
I trust people with certain things but not to extent of what I trust my best friends with
wb and lmao Skylands
What best friends :P
04o-o
04Who nickalerted?
Drake I did
read up, diiot >:(
HML wants his face ripped off. lol

13:/
/me just tries to be nice, XP
13That links in with a pet peeve I've recently developed actually
Heh, I try to be nice, but if someone gets me frustrated )which is very rare), no more Mr. Sane HML
I'm like that to my friends but not to everyone else
13I can't stand when people tell me to be polite |D
angel I know that feeling...
04NS I cbf
HML you're not sane anyway
before about doing the slightest thing wrong
13eg "Say please >:/" the ONE time I forget to say please
That's the point ;P
i've tried being that way too, but you can't please anyone
Drake stop being lazier than I am
If I'm even less sane ;o
13I say it every other time, why get on my back the one time I forget :<
*everyone
04oic
Well
/me slaps Skylands around a bit with a large trout
I was really mean when I was younger... XP

03so in other words it sounds completely differet? o.o
03*different
I don't know.
I've never been to a concert.
lol
Lol, any live performances always sound better.
tbh I kinda like owl city...although his lyrics are comepletely random
not that lyrics really matter nowadays, lol
03have you heard bands like Green Day live?
03They suck
03horribly
^
/me loves Owl City :3
03I like Owl City too
But that's cause they always sucked.
03but really, only Fireflies
03LOL
03point being a lot of more modern groups suck live
alligator sky and lonely lullaby are my two favorite from him
because they are more somber and less quirky
6I had a dream I was at an Owl City concert
X3
*favorites
6and he was just sitting there
6with his computer
6it was bizarre
XP

I actually found some clothes to buy first so I could hide it, then I used the self-checkout
:P
Hahaha
we figured that would be a good way to get him talking
"I'll just find a way to do both at the same time"
what, send him a letter about lasers and ponies?
RDX wanted to talk about the forum
12meow
So to start the conversation...

well now
that is just wrong
I know right.
He should be shot.
We must go and correct him immediately
Don't you have to be a bro to be a brony? I dunno what the feminine word for it is.
RDX's face when we discuss ponies
http://i.imgur.com/1WgDb.gif
They discusse that on ponychan.
Hey, that was me
They decided a brony is anyone who likes that show.
ah
"Would there be as much male slavery as there is in the cartoons? I'd rather not be forced into constant mining for super-feminist overlords."
Wut.
You best be trollin'.
I facepalmed at that
I don't see male slavery
just a lack of males
and a greater lack of intelligent males
Of course he's trolling
I'm going to correct what he said about RD's cutie mark.
herp
Do it.
durp
Nyah.
Done.
We are the cutie mark crusaders
Lol.
On a quest to correct everyone about cutie marks
Hahaha
XD
Hayn
And we will never stop the journey
Can I join this crew?
Hahaha.
We're all such bronies.
I'll be an apprentice, since I have much to learn about cutie marks
How did this happen?
Not until everyone knows RD's cutie mark
LOL
hey dari
Yeah?
is this really what your change looks like?
http://i.imgur.com/zPx0h.jpg
if so that's awesome
Those are some of the newer ones I think.
woah
that is cool
Much cooler than our state quarters
Yeah
I wish ours made a shield
but then again we don't have a history of crusading and such
other than
Cutie Mark Crusading!

That was the original

04wow
They exceed it.

Lawl, pokemanz, IZ CHILDRANZ GAME Y U PLAY IT IZ RUBBISH
???????
:P
That was retarded
pfft
o-O
That's what your'e doing to me.
i spent an extra hour on that exam
huhwhat
Due to stupid mistakes on two problems
i don't dislike mlp because it's for children
Pffff.
:P
Why then?
I would have been done within half an hour of starting
Watch I get half of them wrong anyways
well
BCOZ IZ 4 GURLZ?
perhaps because the majority of the fans are ANNOYINGLY OBSESSIVE etc
04Lol wow
04you done now though?
.-.
not saying the same does not occur within the pokeman community
I don't see why other people are a reason to dislike something.
It was open book though xD
04lolnice
I'm sure I aced it
nice
Just....my mistakes
04did you hear
I'm too stupid loooooooooooooool
I'm not really bothered anyway, I just think you guys are missing out. :P
when something you feel neutral about is thrown at you long enough, you either learn to like it or hate it
i suppose i just went the other way :P
04I spent around an hour on the spinning Pokéball animation and the loop is only 3 seconds
04|D
..loooooooooooooool
did someone say ponies
but yeah, why do you like it?
Ok at my cat now bbl
no
:)
....car
k
8x hxhx ffj ucjdjv jk if
04You ever do something like that? Put effort into something so small it's neglidgable?
god i hope someone said ponies.
It's just disappointing when people dismiss it before they've even watched it.

Lol.
x.x I can't believe I'm stuck on the first quest
rofl Altair
I can't stand all the fanatical idiots of MLP
suddenly cherry smell
ok, odd
Well, I wouldn't call myself fanatical.
anyway
I cant believe this
MLP is just more retarded.
I've watched it and it's okay but really
there will always be hardcore fantards
the fanbase is more retarded than the show is
I don't see how the fanbase is worse than most others.
but when you go onto a site -not about mlp- and all you see is mlp, then it gets annoying
Fair point.

Altair
remember I deleted the badwords.conf?
;p
I need to readd it
HAHA yes
XD
you could still spamfilter it probably
yeah
I haven't seen that many bronies posting on forums that aren't pony forums anyway, just a couple of people who have ponies in their sigs/avatars, but they don't talk only about ponies. They don't unless it's on topic usually.
4I'm still not watching the opening
same
I still don't either
I didn't like it at first.
Now I do.
02Well, at least I completed my lagiacrus Set 8D ... but DDDD:
I didn't like most of the song at first.
Now I like pretty much all of them.

hopefully it doesn't molest your server :U
like the lightning that hit the old one
lmfao
I don't hate pokemon because you guys like it, I just don't understand your point of view. :o
heh, once i got a new ethernet card it worked like a charm
i use it for a media station hooked up to some huge tower speakers
lol
...lmfao
'night
also quick PM
honestly, i'm not big into pokemon much anymore
i still haven't finished black version
I kind of gave up on pokemon.
lol Altair
however, i still like certain characters, i.e. ho-oh and lugia :P
I haven't even finished HG
actually I've barely started HG
When I realised that all I was doing was playing the same game again and again with more watered down and crap pokemon each time.
heh
i had to finish SS
The originals were so good.
and yeah dari, sad but true.

so whats everyone up to?
3ds Max.
bbl
Still no word for the admin of OFF. :/
huh
He read the PM but has yet to respond.
Can't tell if he's busy or if he ignored it. xD
thinking it over maybe
hopefully he didn't ignore it :P
He's usually very cordial so I doubt he did.
Pony withdrawal.
Hahahaha.
Y'all are a bunch o' jabronies.
I still don't get that. :P
Do you know what a jabrony is?
Nope.
/me chortles in his joy.
Nope, and I don't intend to.
Ok.
It kind of stopped being funny a while ago. I cringe at the commercials now.
Heheh.
4:D
4The show is great
/me flops
isn't it?
Well, I hope the bandwagon loses a wheel soon.
you have to get a few episodes in, but it does get good
And crashes into a ditch.
oh?
eh
I think it'd solve the Open Discussion cluttering and random chatter that doesn't need to stay on the forum.
I don't know if OFF needs one
most of the "random chatter" is in night flight and that's always been around...
If you look around nearly every topic has gone off onto tangents.'
So much so that I got tired of trying to police them all
well then we can work on enforcing more rules, getting one of the admin's to post a public reminder to stay on topic?
Well, we were talking about this here earlier
We can do both. I think it would benefit the server (in drawing more attention and publicity) as well as maybe give some of the members who have been clamoring for a chatbox all these years an outlet for their off-topic banter.
We thought it could bring more people for epic-chat
I'm not saying this is going to solve everything, but it would make it less of a hassle to enforce stricter rules on the forum.
I don't see how it'd be a hassle
If you think about it, we've been telling people not to go off-topic for years and it's never really stuck.
I'm not just referring to new people, it's the older members perhaps even more so.
I think it'd be easier to get to know everyone that way too
I certainly know all you guys more from here than SF or OFF
Mhm. The only thing I'm worried about is people spilling in from #owlfantasy into here...
like what happened to Spyrochat around the time I joined...
It could be like the old #spyrochat days though
well I gotta go to the store, be back later
vulcan and crew
They won't be able to work out how to join other channels. :P
And yeah, what dari said
haha
OFF IRC
@Dari: Some of them are actually pretty competent, and they could easily teach the noobs how to hop channels.
4Eww
jk at my last comment
4I dunt want more Wolfaboos
xD I was about to say. Textbook ragequit.
Ammeg may be annoying
LOL
That word.
I like it.
I agree, but he was good for laughs
Ancient Winds is worse.
Ammeg is almost tolerable.
yeah AW can be bad too
4I can tell I am gonna have a lot of fun cutting em down
I personally am glad pianomaestro never seems to be there
he always annoyed me
I love how I've literally owned every single debate in that philosophical discussion thread. xD
Hahaha
FU
Yes
exactly
:P
:P
4Or
4'I'm a wolf.'
He certainly made Dances With Wolves enjoyable when we watched it
^for that reason
ahahaha
4Seriously
4He makes people with Aspergers look retarded
that was a buffalo
oh yeah
XD
4LOLWUT
some buffalo was hit by an arrow in the movie
but you couldn't see the arrow
it looked like it just flat out died
rage quit
and threw the wiimote
4Oh
which killed the buffalo
4Good man
but for some reason this was changed before the movie was released
4So my mom just walked in on me watching MLP
Hahaha
BRAWL ME
look into ur past
realise ur a dick
4Convo went awkward
hahaha
4I told her I grew a hairer chest

I have yet to be walked in on while watching MLP

Nyan
I'm far more useful than last year's model.
About what?
RDX didn't come back
Haha
My bad :P
I'm not surprised. He was really pissed off.
well, he will be back eventually
he probably just hasn't been by his computer since it pinged out
working or something
If he does, he'll be gone again at the drop of a hoof. xD
4Talking to h im now
oh, nevermind
I was wrong again
He just hates us
Because he's talking to him
4Yeah, he hates you guys
4Like
4He's actually pissed off
wait, really?
D:
if he is I'm really sorry
I don't mean to piss anyone off
I could tell you guys were pushing him last night.
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 13Venipede.
4Yeah
But I think hate is a bit of an exaggeration.
4That's kinda why I stopped and resorted to barely coming on here today
4That and talking to people
I didn't expect him to get mad about something like that
I didn't even realize
I didn't think he would either
Doesn't seem like him
4Well
He always acts like he's mad like that
4You guys did go off continoiously
to me at least
I never realized it was serious
4when he asked you multiple times to stop
4I picked up right on it
4Not last night
4but today I did
See, if I had gotten a direct "Stop talking about ponies now" I would have realized
I didn't want to look like a certain phallic organ, so I didn't speak up, but it was clear to me at least.
heh
Yeah, it really didn't seem clear to me either
4Ha
4Well
4Now we know
like I said he always acts that way to me
Yeah
So let's do it moooooore!
4He says he doesn't care about if we like it
4but to take it to another channel
Or to ponychan.
4Cupcakes
I could tell he was a little annoyed at it, which was why I suggested the other channel
But not that he was seriously pissed off about it
I can see the misunderstanding, because he just has that crass personality where he acts like he hates everything.
Yeah
Exactly
4WEll, you didn't hear it from me
See, after so many years I still can't pick up on people's emotions through text
What I don't understand was why he didn't just tell us this
we would've stopped
It seemed like you guys knew he was perturbed, though, especially when you guys said you were going to talk about it more because RDX said he hated it.
well, I knew he was annoyed
but not pissed
not enough to leave
Fair enough.
Well, I've got school in the morning, so asta la pizza.

See ya
Bye
Oh, one more thing.
4Pizza?

Hi Roara
Stupid Gamesurge IRC, F**King channel admin kicked me for no damn reason
>>
Blah gnight
or not
I should be asleep.
speak of the... brony
Since it's 5:18 am and I have an exam at 9.
XD
what time is it there?
ohhh
XD
probably
Ponies I hope
English.
Lawl.
ah
I'll write about ponies.
You should
it's what you've been studying after all
have any?
here were mine
o_O
I don't know.
I think I'm just going to make everyone op
Yay!
:D
I'm already owner on 2 channels
I love ops for all and all for ops
I omly am on 1
and it's dead
Can't believe RDX actually got annoyed.
I thought he was just playing along.
me either
like, only me and Channy there
me either
I thought so too
he always pretends to be mad
who knew he actually was this time
Oh well. SUCCESSFUL TROLLESTIA IS SUCCESSFUL!
XD
haha
Clearly he's just too manly for ponies (or not enough, heheheh).
that show is way better than everyone thinks
Yeah, I was impressed by that.
everyone who watches it becomes a fan
he was here before he went to bed
this channel
yeah
O_o
So people who expect to hate it, hate it.
like him at first
then, and I quote
"I'm going to watch episode 3"
next thing you know
Hahaha.
LOL
Ponies are magic.
hmm
that might make a good topic right there
mm?
Yes, I'll do that in a minute
I don't want anyone who joins, though
ah
Channy's been female as long as I can remember
This channel is going to be vulerable enough to trolls as it is
Nah, we'll just love and tolerate the shit out of them.
XD
:P
and dari
that's also true
Looooooooool, bot love triangle.
I forget how the story went
I know there's at least one gay couple in there somewhere
Something like that
Hahaha, nice
nice touch, the last episode part
I like that
That'll be more useful when season 2 comes out
yeah
All I talk about on IRC is ponies now.
me too
it's weird
eh, it used to be pokemon
God, what happened? XD
so I guess it isn't so weird
oh dari
I almost forgot
Yeah?

Definitely.
good news
epic-chat.net contains no active threats
according to google
Hahaha.
Good to know
yep
I'm reading up on your tutorial
What about the pony invasion forces it harbours?
12back
Maybe we could get some of the bronies from ponychan over here
Haha
Ponies.
Discuss.
it would get WAY crowded if we did that
:P
That could be another way to bring more people to the network...
Hmm.
I've been lurking a lot
Bronies welcome
NETWORK TRAFFIC OVERLOAD!
It seems like a nice community for the most part
yeah, I get that too
they do seem friendly
I'm just clueless about *chans
same
ponychan is good because they don't allow porn.
honesstly I get confused looking at it
they might not trust me since I'd be just another anon
"Where are the threads!"
*?!
It took me a while for me to work out that you had to click reply to open them. XD
oh you do?
that makes sense
I figured that out when I was lurking 888chan during their "raid"
I thought there just were no threads
haha
That'd be pretty cool.
it seemed annoying to me
Do you have a tripcode or whatever, dari?
Nope.
Damn
I post anonymous.
hard to keep track of what everyone's saying
tripcode?
what the hooves is that?
It's the closest thing to registration there is on chans
oh
How do you think they'd take some random anon asking them to join a channel on some unheard of IRC network?
haha
probably ignore it
Somehow, even though all I'm talking about is ponies, I can't say "anypony" it just seems...Too far. XD
serious question
honestly
dari: same here
it might get overlooked or ignored
Which board would you post on?
probably /www/
Fair enough.
seems like it would fit best there
Yeah.
you don't think that if it did work it would get too crowded here?
I kinda like just the three-five of us
Honestly, epic-chat really needs traffic though.
We have draconicwolves for that
If you /list you see there's just about nobody.
not for pony talk though
(nopony :P)
Right now it's just the same as DW only minus RDX
And yeah, this network could really use some more people
I guess, but like it's nice talking to just you guys about ponies
I dunno
But this is a show about friendship!
:P
We should be making new friends!
:P
Most of the ponychanners are pretty nice.
They are
I know they are, I just like small communities is all
http://www.amirite.net/592407
Lawl when this is negative.
haha
it says -10 for me

*you
I've played it. :P
ah
I wasn't sure
Good game.
it is
one that I've been meaning to play again
rainbow dash looks awesome with goggles
Yeah, it kept me busy for a while.
me too
Wait till you see/hear Rainbow Dash's song in the final episode.
IT. IS. SO. AWESOME!
I did all the survival challenges
even picking all the flowers
nice
I'm looking forward to it
I think I finished just about all of the offline.
same
none of the online however
But some of the online achievements were too hard.
my ethernet port in my room is busted
I really couldn't be bothered to get the highest level or whatever.
so no online for me
haha, I imagine
casts a spell to make them stop eating the food
but they eat everything else
XD
XD Owned.
In RDR.
which guy?
I can't remember
In one of the side quests there was some guy who knew your name.
ah
And he'd just randomly disappear and stuff.
I might've missed a few side quests
this one sounds interesting though
Yeah, he was pretty interesting.
I should go back to my old save and look for it
do you remember where he's at?
I can't remember where originaly, just the last place you meet him.
hmm
it's a recurring one then
Yeah.
I'd be surprised if you hadn't done it.
I probably have
and I'm just drawing a blank atm
You say "Damn you", and he says "Many do".
huh
interesting
yeah, I actually do think I must've missed that one
Hm.
Well it's good, you should do it.
I know I missed a few
I'll be sure to
Did you finish all the main storyline?
yeah
including the sidequest with Jack avenging John
That's strange.
I don't see how it would work if you did it with Jack instead of John.
judging by the sound of it I bet not
but I have a new playthrough going
just haven't played it in a while
so I should still be able to play as John
Oh, cool.
is he this guy?
http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/14320288/images/rdr_0847.jpg
Not sure, I don't think so, let me check.
Oh, it is him.
ah
I haven't then
he doesn't look familiar
I found a RD wiki though
I can find out where the first side quest with him is
I bet I just missed the first and so couldn't do the later ones
Haha
it's called
I Know You
fitting
Yeah.
starts in hennigan's stead
yeah
only available for John to get that side mission
spoiler
oops
I should stop reading about this
:P
it's interesting though!
Also, the final location where you meet the Strange Man, who remarks "This is a nice spot", is the same spot John is buried in the final cutscene.
^woah
Yep.
tomorrow after wotk
I am turning on this game
and playing it again
and coming on here of course
Heheheh.
see how many ponychan bronies come
you know you have your earbuds in the wrong ears when Pinkie Pie marches off to the right, but the music goes to the left ear
Lol.
FILLYDELPHIA
HAHAHAHA
:P
The vastness of RDR is amazing.
yeah it is
more games need that
I love open world games
And some of the scenery could actually be considered beautiful.
I mean, I love spyro and all, but linear gets old eventual
Even though it's just a game, some places looks really nice.
*eventually
yeah they do
I've sat staring at canyons and mountains for like ten minutes at time
*times
Spyro Rockstar style, LOL.
Hahahaha!
that would be interesting
Walking through a city of sheep.
You flame them and the sheep police come for you.
XD
or Spyro Noire
you are a sheep detective
LOL
/me hasn't played L.A. Noire yet
too many ponies
and Firefly
I've just seen adverts, looks pretty good.
just watched Firefly
yeah, it does
it is from what I've heard
oh wow
dun dun DUN
wasn't me this time
I also like the statistics they give you in RDR.
yeah
Damn that's a lot of pings.
this is a long shot but
or not a long shot
a bold statement
anyway
I'd say RDR is my favorite rockstar game
I liked GTA IV
I haven't played that many GTA games.
but all the GTA's before that I didn't care for like most people do
12 Hello, Guest50050 and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
I like GTA IV because your character isn't a gnagster like the earlier ones
Oh, what are you?
he's just an immigrant who gets swept up in a big mess of crime
Ah.
I wonder if anyone's ever lined up a whole town of people on the train track in RDR.
while trying to make enough money for he and his cousin to survive
Hahahaha
that would be funny
took me a while just to get the one
I don't remember what kept going wrong
Hahaha.
I think I always missed the train
Yeah, the train was annoying to catch.
I remember trying to do that very clearly
when I first got RDR I went to a friend's house to playing
I remember trying to jump a horse onto a carriage.
we must've been up 24 hours straight playing it that day
Wow.
:P
that game is great
man, I really want to play it now
Hahaha.
I didn't buy the expansion.
Hello Aristiguest
me neither
I thought it sounded interesting, but I preferred the game as it was
Dunno why. Just didn't appeal to me. I don't think it could have really added anything to the storyline, or game in general.
no aombies
*zombies
yeah, agreed
I thought the story was amazing as it was
haha
Yeah.
Seems just like an SR move to me.
MONIES!
Lol.
and all it took to make her more interested was pointing out that Marston's a family man
LOL
Oh yeah, another thing I like is all the mini games in RDR.
she was under the impression there was no story and it was just a game to be badass
oh yeah me too
I am king at that one dice game
Poker is fun.
I forget what it's called
Poker I suck at
always have
Liar's Dice
that's it
Ah, well I started young with the poker. :P
I sweep the house with Liar's Dice
Haha, you pro liar.
ah, yeah, see I've only known the rules to poker for a while now
dunno why, card games just never really work with my brain
I have to go over the rules and sets every time I play
I think I only play Texas hold 'em poker.
oh, you know what's sad
What?
one of the missions in that game I spent the longest amount of time trying to do
was shooting those damn crows
:P
LOL
XD
I don't remember how hard I found that.
Maybe I did too. :P
I didn't realize that you only needed to shoot the ones that were flying into the door
I tried shooting every single one with the shotguns
Lol.
and they would just eat all my grain
Oh.
and I would fail
That makes sense.
I was a pro at the knife game.
yeah, I didn't realize they could only get in one way
five finger filet?
rawr
Yeah.
power went out here
I was decent at it
not power, internet
I'm struggling to think of something I don't like about that game.
Hmm
I honestly can't think of any right now
Though maybe I only had minor complaints which are forgotten since I haven't played it in a while.
that was probably my favorite game of last year
And there's SO MUCH that's right with it.
oh, yeah, probably
same here most likely
all I can remember is the good stuff
I mean
even non gameply
graphics, voice-acting, AI
Though they were sometimes annoying to try and get to show up.
all amazing
oh, yeah they were
not enough of them either, I felt
talking to him on XBL, not here
Oh right.
that was back when my ethernet port still worked
I swear I saw this one glitch with a carriage on youtube.
It bounced up and down madly, then there was a cutscene and the sheriff commented on it.
Woah, no way
But then it wouldn't have been a glitch.
yeah
I'm confused.
I remember that clearly.
it would've been a bug the developers noticed and instead of fixing, made fun of
Rockstar is definitely one to make fun of their own mistakes
they make fun of anything
speaking of which, did you ever go in the theatres?
funny stuff sometimes
I went in one of them.
The one about the snake oil seller.
ah
yeah, I went in that one and another that made fun of both feminists and anti-feminists of the time
Lol.
it was from the satirical perspective of the anti-feminists
I forget how it went though
I think that was it though
there was too much else to do to spend my time in a theatre
Oh I found it.
*than spend
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2r8S4uke34
the wagon thing?
Watch.
WTF
XDDD
The ending.
A cutscene.
O___o
not there quite yet
/me has had slow internet for some reason the last few days
oh I thought of another little touch that made me jump for joy the first time I noticed it
this game
has wilhelm screams
Haha.
LOL
we noticed it when my friend and I were playing
Unicorn.
I just remember him saying "OH MY GOD A WILHELM SCREAM"
I love that scream.
When it is used?
random enemies will do it
LOL
when dying
I know right
classic!
Have you ever tried the 1-Hit-Kill on a bear?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdENXifMyYM
yeah
never got it though
I'm just proud of killing one with a knife
Yeah.
You just wait till it's about to hit you.
Then stab and it dies in one hit.
yeah
oh
it took two hits for me
is it the timing of it?
Well if you time it right you get a 1-hit-ko.
nice
If you want to perform a melee kill on a bear in "true John Marston-fashion", lock on to a charging bear with your combat knife (NOTE: in this instance, timing is everything). Be patient and hold your ground. Center your screen on the bear's head. Once the bear comes just close enough to almost touch you, swing your combat knife. If done correctly, you will kill it with one clean slash across the bear's face. If not, you will most likely die, so having previously saved your game in Manzanita Post is a good idea. One may practice the required timing in multiplayer, making it easier for your single-player challenge.
From the wiki.
woah
that's cool
I think I've done it once or twice.
I have to try it
http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100531130849/reddeadredemption/images/d/d5/Rdr_achieve_bearlylegal.jpg
got to the cutscene in the video
It'd probably look like something epic like that.
woah, what costume is that?
One of the extras.
ah
I always use the one you get the first time you turn in a criminal
because trenchcoats/dusters are win
That's the "Expert Hunter Outfit"
and the one for doing all the challenges once it's unlocked
ah
You had to pre-order to get it.
dang it
there was another pre order one I wanted
And you got the "Deadly Assassin" and "Savvy Merchant" ones too.
I think it was deadly assassin
OH.
They only released one?
released one what?
of the outfits?
Yeah.
You can't get the others.
oh, huh
weird
Only the assassin one.
It was decided by a vote on a site.
I didn't want to kill the buffalos.
Since they don't come back.
but then
"Rockstar released the Savvy Merchant and Expert Hunter outfits as free downloads on October 12th, 2010 to show its appreciation to all the Red Dead fans out there."
Oh.
There's a Jackalope wut?
in the undead nightmares expansion yeah
one of the reasons I did want it
The war horse looked cool.
Pre-order only again though.
aww
I actually didn't know about how the bufflo can go extinct
There was a glitch where you could get the war horse online too.
If you had it.
I only killed them when I had to because it looked so cool with the herds everywhere
Yeah.
I didn't want to disturb them
Wow.
Undead thing has a horse that's on fire.
hi
we made a Pony channel too
#bronies
omg ahhaa
hey
hi again
Hey.
RDX doesn't like us talking about ponies
REALLY doesn't like it apparently.
I forget how do I auto login to a second channel when I connect to the server
right click on the server
on the left
select "Edit Server..."
and go to autojoin channels
oh I just clicked add to autojoin when I right clicked on #bronies
same thing?
ah
yeah that should do it too
yay
oh hey
/hop #bronies
dari, hop
:P
haha
not you for some reason
Oh well.
she must've forgotten
she said she was gonna do it for us all
oh cool I was wondering why my name was different
I got some pokemon cards and stickers at fred meyers :D
what do you think?
oh, nice
.,...ehh
I agree actually
I like small groups of people personally
honestly anything with chan I just don't even wanna be part of
If you've lurked ponychan you'd see they're actually mostly really nice.
besides I have a harder time making friends on the internet these days with people I don't know
I just feel like I couldn't if I tried
Porn and hardcore gore images aren't allowed on it.
So it isn't like 4chan.
OOH I GOT A RESHIRAM CARD
still
eh
Woah, nice
Hm.
was it one of those packs where there's a guaranteed card?
or was it random?
Undead also gives you a death horse.
Which is near invincible and leaves a trail that kills most things it comes into contact with.
I bought the one with a sparkly snivy card on the front
so it wasn't one of the tins
O__o Seems a bit overpowered.
Nice!
Dari: that is way overpowered
You can't kill it by shooting it.
Unless it's too the head.
I just bought a new webcam, and a dvd on amazon
but it needed to be so much money to get free shipping
AWESOME!
and I was a dollar off
lol
It also adds a unicorn which has a "permanent halo of butterflies and leaves a rainbow trail in its wake as it gallops"
WANT!
WANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNT!
XDDD
my stupid bank keeps refusing to let amazon charge me though
so my order keeps getting cancelled
D:
I can't believe how much some owl books cost on amazon
like
I'm gonna stop in and talk to them tomorrow
if I get up early enough that is :P
I was looking at resources from the owl pages on owl folklore and mythology
Meh, it's 7:32 am now, I have to get ready for school. XD
some are like 150 bucks each
No sleep for me. :(
D:
dari how are you alive
you like NEVER sleep
WHAT 150!
OH MY GOD!
Sorry for keeoing you up talking about video games dari
:P
O____________________________________________o 150. What the hell.
:P
woah, seriously?
150?!
yeah
dollars?
No sleep is sometimes better than little sleep.
yes
holy crap
dari: that is true
I wonder how much deane has spent on owl resources in total
you feel less weary
hm, I wonder
I can't find ANY owl lore/mythology books at my library either
there's only one that you can place a hold on and it's a picture book so it's no use to me
do they have GOG books even?
which sucks because I was really interested in the stuff
yeah they have all the GoG books you can places holds on
and you can choose hardback or paperback
but I assume you already have those
I don't own all of them, just some
ah
there's barely any owl books that aren't picture books I can order though, either
I was only able to order 3
that weren't children's picture books
throughout the entire sno isle branch in my state
OH MY GOD
IT IS TOO COOL!
oh wow
MUST HAVE UNICORN!
XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWXekpev02Q
That rainbow trail.
Oh my God.
Butterfly swarm.
Too much awesome.
LOL
XD
:P
DARI HAS NO SHAME

Heheheh.

Yep, I'm going to marry him.

13LOL
13I mainly use Reimu and Komachi
6oh god and then you go onto Sky Arena
13though I've mostly forgotten how to do most of their attacks >:/
6THAT is insane stuff
/me mainly uses Tenshi (or however is spelled) <3
6Tenshiiiii <3
13Sometimes I jump and do attacks simply because it looks more awesome than attacking on the ground |D
6SO COLORFUL
13Oh, and I've NEVER managed to understand how the spellcard system works
6really?
6what do you mean?
13all I know is that some do actual attacks, and others don't :<
6yeah
6I don't really like that
13the ones that don't do attacks, well I've no idea what those actually do
6but I know that I use the non-attack ones to pay to use my higher attacks
6they're pretty useless otherwise, imo
13Now I'm wondering whether I should get Hisoutensoku or not
6DO IT
13and whether it'll patch correctly or not since the game's only on my USB |D
6at least for the sake of having it
6we could totally try network play sometime
13even though we were doing everything right o-o
6you guys need to use hamachi
13Oh, do I need to find Hisoutensoku with an English patch or can I just find it on its own?
13since I already have SWR in English
6well, UNL is its own game, different story and everything
6so you'll need a patch eventualy

03I dunno, 5th gen just popped out of the ground it looks like
03and no there isn't
Flamingo missingo
03there's only 4 forms of Missingno

12KITE!!!!
Hawk
Red kites over Reading, I took some pictures.
12Kite, not hawk
Orly
:o
Only with a digital camera though, so they're not very good.
12well I can tell it's a Kite ;>
6oh my god that's a beautiful kite
03what do you mean "only with a digital camera"
03opposed to what?
03film cameras are only comprable to like 12 megapixels or so
A couple of miles away near where my sister's boyfriend lives we saw about 7 flying around in one field. That's more countryside though.
03and now household digital cameras do more than tha tXD
I know dis because I watched a walle-E extra
03mine's an old one that only does 4 but...
I dunno, the zoom on it wasn't great.
03Wall-QE was 2.35 though.
03-Q
yees
DRF: I'm not great with cameras. :P
BRB
they were trying to simulate the look of anamorphic panavision camera.
03so Jurassic Park is natively stratched?
duno
03I just don't get how that works
look at lights. if they go from circle to oval, when it defocuses, it's anamorphic.
03hm
03I mean, I get how anamorphic works if it's already filmed and is PROCESSED that way
03but if hte camera has a lens of 2.35:1, how would you make that 1.85 without making everything look stretched in processing
03besides cropping, which is what people used to do
03hence open mattinmg
03-m
12I am going to make dinner now, AFK ^v^
oh, mb it's anamorphic 1.85>4:3 ?
or whatever
03I thought you just said panavision was 2.35
Seeyas Arti
panavision could make other AR cameras
iduno
03I guess I just don't get how anamorphic cameras work in general
.v.
03if it's normally 4:3, I get filming it as such and cropping it
03but eh
Kites are a type of bird

03but that's 20x longer than half a second
03so
03also LOL OPENING IMAGES BY DEFAULT IN FIREWORKS OR PHOTOSHOP
Ew no
03so pathetic
LOOOL
03real pros use Windows Image viewer
03but seriously
Windows picture viewer
FAST
:D
Paint > all.
03Fireworks srets itself as default >_>
Windows Vista paint > Xp paint > 7 Paint
Or so on
:P
Pfft, Vista.
03yep
03EW THE RIBBON
EWW TABS
XD
It's on Vista, therefore is horrible.
No it isn't
03Vista paint is the same as XP.
:>
03it just lets you undo more than one thing at a time
Which is a improvement XD
03and I use it as it's x64
lawls
Come at me bro.
That a vista program is better than XP
03I overwrote the Windows 7 paint with Vista's
No thanks :<
:P
Meh, I keep 7
Just because XD
I just kept XP. Nice and simple.
(I can just use paint from my previous XP install on the same drive )
:P
Yay backups
http://i.imgur.com/cHDoI.jpg
03well, I overwrote it as I would never need to use that POS 7 Paint
But windows 7 paint has transparency and pretty stencils/brushes ;o
6I'm totally BSing this exam...lol
Eugh, the Titanic. Never watched it. Distorted history FTL.
04Windows 7 paint still sucks.
04And lol Roara
(I still hate XP for having a horrible zoom, or zoom out that is)
03Vista's Paint is probably the only good thing about Vista :P
Other than direct x 11?
/me shot
6oh my god the oldest human ever to live was 122 years old
Is that it?
Son I am disappoint.
6it?
6that's insane
lol
;p
Only a extra 40 years
6since the average is 78
03oh darn it
/me flees
03On Lifetime HD, Unsolved Mysteries is stretched
6that's almost 50 years more
03so I'm watching standard def version
U mad at no HD ;o
I still see no difference between HD and standard definition.
Either that or the difference is so small that I see little point. :o
^ SOmeone who agrees with me
/me hides
Now HD monitor resolutions
THat's a whole different comparision ;p
13I can see the difference between HD and standard
13but I CAN'T see the difference between normal DVD and Blu-Ray
13o-o
/me claps
06I can see the difference between SD and HD
03well
Oh, I do see that difference. O___o
06But not between, say 720p and 1080p :P
DVD and bluray.
03it really depends on the material
03some DVDs look just as Blu-Ray
03others don't
06Except stuff like Avatar on Blu-Ray
03depends on the bitrate
03XD
Compression man
06That's just
03movies like I, Robot
03that DVD
03looks as good as teh Blu-Ray
06gottam
03I compared it
I Robot, haven't seen that in so long.
I love that film.
6same
I loved that movie
03same
06THat's a good movie
:LOL
Hivemind
FIRING LOIC! :P
03it's just, now I have Lifetime HD so I thought I'd watch Unsolved Mysteries on that
03but it's stretched and I refuse to watch anything that's stretched
13I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't really care too much for Avatar
I don't either.
I don't care
>c.
13well, it's not that I don't like it
13But I don't see anything special about it
13xD
It's not that special?
.v.
So
Plot was meh, and while I think the CGI was pretty good, I don't think it was AMAZING! MOSMAGOSDJAFIGOJS
I never saw the blu-ray or 3D version
Just SD on a small 16in CRT TV
Using my Wii
/me shot
I didn't see any 3D when I watched it 3D in the cinema.
13I've never watched a movie in 3D before
6I liked avatar because of the graphics, and the creatures
13so I dunno what it's like o-o
6it wasn't the godsend of movies though
My first 3D movie that I actually put on the glasses was the new pirates of the carribean :P
Since they FILMED it in 3D
6rio was actually somewhat decent in 3D, but i don't care for 3D really
12I haven't even watched Avatar
13I want to see Rio D:
I never saw Rio
06I really don't like 3d tbh ugh
13I've seen half of Avatar LOL
Looked a bit too silly lol
3D as is now seems pretty poor.
6rio was adorable
12I just realised I'm really slow at watching new movies.
13At someone's house, but left in the miffle of it
13...
13lol miffle
13*middle
6miffle
12I only just watched Scott Pilgram vs the world yesterday
Wasn't Rio the film based on angry birds? Or is that something else?
6....lol this exam
Angry birds had RIo characters in it
Or a spinoff

13It's always just one particular spellcard that takes every spare life I have too
6what game
03Holy crap
03@ this Unsolved Mystery
03there was this nurse at a hospital who would basically steal babies then give them up for adoption in exchange for a large amount of cash
03the concept of that is just... ._.
Evil :|
6...
6o_o
03well, one of the kids met their real mom
0326 years later LOL
03the guy never did
6that's horrible
03I don't think
03yeah
03one of those 3 babies was on Oprah apparently
6what happened to the original mothers? what did the nurse tell them about the babies?
03well
6did she say they died or something?
03nope
03the one that was on Oprah, she didn't say anything, and that mom had been after the nurse forever saying she stole the baby
03which she did
6x.x
03the other one, apparently the mother said she never wanted to give the baby up for adoption but the nurse tricked her into signing the form
03and apparently the nurse traded a boat for that baby
03but yeah that just sucks
6O_O
03and this is why you use Beaumont or something LOL
03LL is going to freak when I tell her about that

I think I found the next song I want to remix
You could have a horse that leaves a trail of death in its wake, or is on fire, but I'd rather have the unicorn that spawns butterflies and a rainbow trail as it runs.

Unless they have the protected status.
ah
I didn't realize that :P
/me is a derp
:(
12sory
12this dragon can not be owned
for some reason I was thinking that ops just can't be kicked
there :3
@pony

12o-o
12no
eeeeeeyup
haha
yes

/cs set #bronies GUARD OFF
Blarg.
Big Macintosh
what command?
what did you try to do?
>:)
Nothing.
:O
ah, I figured it would be Big Mac... Big Macintosh is a cheeseburger!
no really
12hi
did you try kicking channy herself?
12there happy now?
Pretty much.
/cs set #bronies GUARD OFF
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 9 minutes

just how it should be :>
12a small furry critter owning a big strong dragon?
12should be the other way around
size in this case doesn't matter :P
big things come in small packages :3
Cucumber
Nope.avi
12o-o
You tried to unregister the channel?!
Filter doesn't seem to work any more.
gasp
It doesn't unregister it. :P
unregister meaning make channy go away?
:O
So?
so the channel will go away when everyone leaves
That doesn't unregister the channel.
meaning it's not registered anymore
Nope.
Do it.
We'll se.
..
...
see*
12lies
I wrote the tutorials for epic-chat
not really
*nobody's
And never corrected that
after all I still own your tail
So...
might as well own you too ^^
It's just the guard.
but I've made channels before
I've set it off before, didn't unregister the channel.
and left and come back
I'll make a new channel and do it, sec.
and the topic and stuff were all gone
/j #BLARG!
/cs register
/cs register #BLARG!
!topic BLARG!!!!!
/cs set GUARD off #blarg
/cs set #BLARG! GUARD OFF
/part #BLARG!
/j #BLARG!
Hah, I'm right. :P
#BLARG!
How can you even tell?
I just checked.
No, but how did you check?
Then when we both leave it'll still be here.
Well, the topic.
So you'll se it isn't unregistered.
OK, leave
/part #blarg!
okay so if we all leave then come back
He rejoins when the first person comes back in.
Then leaves.
!pokemon
the topic should still be there you say?
Kosoveon, you are a 11Combusken.
Yep.
02Kosoveon~
Ray~
I tried it with #pokemanz
how goes?
huh
that's really weird
This is weird
He comes back when the first person joins after no one has been in there.
Then leaves immediately.
She*
How do you get rid of a channel then?
how do you ever unregister one?
Check the commands list. :P
/cs help
12!pokemon
02Fine~
And what does Guard mean if not what I thought?
02you?
This channel is now about PONIES <- Nice
pretty good~
So it's the guard setting.
but it sounds like if you turn guard off she still does
she just comes back when someone joins
Comes back in to establish channel topic, and properties probably.
Then leaves.
So doesn't do anything to protect it.

One of the 5398753495 places I applied at needs to give me a freaking job so I'll actually have something to do all day
nope.
lol
"I will smash your windows if you don't give her a job!
anyways, I've been exahusted as of late so I probably should be going to bed
you should sleep yeah
bye
wal mart wont give you a job? wow
good night everyone
night :P
not yet
a shame
I think they still might
Shut up RDX :(
only been two days since the interview
what?
wasn't trying to be insulting
usually Wal Mart can't stop hiring people
Holy f word
I hate my dad
and m y mom
especially my dad
they can go and fucking die
well then if they don't hire me I guess I'm pretty much useless
and then I would fucking danse on their graves and get the insurance money
err
fudging
because that's the only interview I've gotten so far
Hey, that isn't true
you are not useless
but I have to rant somewhere and this is the only place where my problems are heard
nope it's nto
they just must not have had any openings yet
they'll call
just wait for it
anyways, and then I would become successful and then have a good job
and be the greediest person alive
and as for Walmart, it's only been two days, like I said
it's not too early
and then be a millionaire
and start a fake charity that I take money from
and then get rich off that
and then everyone can just go die
and I will be happy
and I can laugh at the world
or wait
*looks at epic-chat*
*too late
Wow, emo night tonight, apparently
4FISH
and then I can be successful and not a failiure like those stupid parents say
4Oh
lol nah
everyone's just angsting
its like their not even my parents anymore
Should i just run away
it's been dead up until just now
I mean they wouldnt care
right?
oh hey Emmi
your wrong.. no matter how little they seem to care currently if you ran away they'd care..
4FUCK
4REd
hey
Kitten: But they are just
4How do I get this last thing for Cinderella's dress?
D:>
4It's like
so stuipd
4a million feet in the air
stupid
BBS?
Cinderella?
and I wish I could just stab them
You're still stuck on that game :P
they're your parents they're supposed to be just so stupid in your opinion
and not get in trouble
4No I beat it
what game is this we speak of?
4But replaying it on Critical mode
Cinderella? whut?
lol
ummmm
4and I have no idea ho wto get the dress peice on top of that wardrobe in the Wardrobe room
I remember that being a pain in the ass
Disney Princess Adventures?
you have to go through the corridors
What is the point of life?
families irritate eachother its just a law of nature
oh, is it Kingdom Hearts?
4fucking level 15 from running around trying to figure this crap out
their is an entrance to it
Kingdom Hearts yes
Birth By Sleep
ah
Ah, okay
it varies with each individual
4I've ran through the two corridors
4one where cheese is stuck in the webs
RDX plays some Disney sappy Kingdom Hearts game but whines when people post ponies? O___o...
it took me awhile to find it
4and the other that leads to her room
their is another way
no, I mean I actually want to kill him
Don't ask me
just my dad
lol
4the one that leads to her room has another passage but IT'S SUPER AMAZING HIGH UP
I thought you were supposed to be sleeping, though :O
my mom I always regret the thought of afte r
I'm revising. :P
But also lurking.
Oh, hah
you know you don't know how lucky you are
yeah I do
well
I have money and blah blah blah
if you get totally lost just go over to the wiki and look it up lol
your wanting to get rid of the thing i've wanted most
ok
DARI GET TO BED RIGHT NOW MISTER
jk
You can take mine
LOL
I haven't been in that section in awhile
Yes sir. :'(
:P
I just want happiness in my like
lie
life*
I was pretending to be like one, yes
I'm too busy getting psyched up for KH3D
4All of my D-Links have been upgraded
how tired are you dari?
you get all the finishers?
after that all nighter last night :P
4Ja
I slept from about 4 PM - 8 PM.
oh, nice thinking
So not very
no cause it wouldn't be the same, my dad died when i was 3, i've wanted him back, and yet you want to kill yours.. that seems kinda selfish, but then again it also could be accounted with self preservation..
:(
you unlock blank points? I forget the requirements
Thats so sad?
Thats so sad.
Should say to RDX: Uhh DISNEY, YOU RUIN MY LIFE! I come back and it's a Disney world. FML I'm leaving.
Heheheh.
4No I didn't get that one
4Dats why I am doing it on Critical mode
4I just have to beat the game
Or is it just supposed to be love and tolerance?
you shouldn't have to do it on critical mode
4So far its pretty cake
seriously
excepet for the challenge
/me shakes her head trust me, whenever your dad does die, if it's before you do.. you'll miss him and want him back..
you can unlock it on proud mode
is what supposed to be love and tolerance?
4I WANT IT IN CRITICAL MODE
4DAMN IT
Of everything.
ah
I think so
lol
I didnt mean to put the question mark there, that was a mistake
then I fixed it on the line after
even parasprites
but I mean
we should even love them
good luck beating the Lingering Sentimet in Critical
Hahaha.
How do I make him just shut up and tell him everything he does pisses me off
?
That was a good one
(when am I NOT gonna say that after reflecting on an episode I just watched?)
Which one are you on now?
umm
just watched the parasprite one last night
I'll look up the next one
just a sec
Hey Curly :)
Call of the Cutie
this sounds epic
4Wow
4I'm a fucking idiot
4On episode 13
You're telling me?
TROLOLO!
12
you've gotten ahead of me
o.o
Nyan
oh wait
I was wrong
I've fallen out of favor. :/
I'm on 11
the winter one
That's one of the best ones
With?
"The whole town of Ponyville is gathering to bring an end to winter"
bring an end to winter?
it started?
:P
Oh, yay!
Yeah, suddenly it's been winter for months
when there hasn't been one winter episode so far
This ragtag group of bronies, of course.
hey Nyan
Shhh! You'll make RDX mad
no you haven't
4Shhh
You can be our resident venom pony.
you're still high up in my ranks of respect at least
4This is a story about different ponies with random adventures
4and this is your biggest concern?
/me halfheartedly fist pumps.
:P
yep
Nah, not a concern
oh hey speaking of Nyan
Nah, but really. Either my jokes have gone stale or your opinion of me has changed.
What do you mean?
...
in the wikipedia article about cat's meows, it listed all the different anomotopeas of it, and Nyan was one
NOBODY LOVES ME ANYMORE!
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME!
No rants, haha.
4Emo
Dari you be quiet and get back to your chemistry
:P
:P
Hahaha.
Yes ma'am.
Just an observation I felt the need to bring up.
if I ever don't laugh at your jokes it's usually because I don't know the reference
4I love the top comment for episode 12 though
usually when I do get them I find them hilarious
4"I can't help but think that this episode﻿ is implicitly about a girl waiting to get her first period."
/me shrugs.
I usually don't get 75% of the references anyway, so...
Maybe that's it, then. Whatever, I'm regretting even bringing it up.
hah
I think I'd know if I didn't find you funny.
And I do.
...There's not much more to say. :P
Haha
Mhm. This is just poor self-esteem talking, methinsk.
*methinks
Forget I said anything.
...
Gah.
choke on something?
:P
/me gurgles.
/me shields himself from a potential spit
4Cupcakes anyone?

For some reason that alone isn't good enough. It needs to be constant lulz, or I go through withdrawals
4LMAO CAPTAIN PLANET

4Mmm
4I found a peice of rainbow hair
4Prolly nothing
I think I just went back in time 5 years
because my dad is treating me like I'm 15
XD
4Oh?
He sends me a message saying "I hope you got permission to use someone else's network"
LOL
I haven't touched my network settings and haven't even attempted to connect to a neighbor's
02z-z
4Message him back saying "Dad, I never ask."
I go upstairs and ask if he's sure that message was meant for me
He says "Well, you're online, and I don't see you on my network"
I go and check my computer
It's connected to our network
I bring it upstairs and show it to my dad
"Oh. My mistake then."
4No kidding
Seriously
first opportunity I get
I am out of here
4Why is everyone I know havign family issues?
I already put up with his shit idea of blocking the internet at midnight and blocking sites I use
I'm not having family issues
I killed and ate my family last night. So no issues for me. :D
haha
that... works
And now he's accusing me of lying and leeching off neighbors' internet on top of that
Actuallt, that's not entirely true.
4Overprotective dads ftl
But yeah, not really family issues, at least not compared to what some people go through
I threw my sister outside so the birds could take a crack at her.
They need to eat, too.
XD
Mine's just an annoyance
4My mom used to be like that
My mom did too
4Back when I was young and retarded, I used to read fanfiction
then she realized I'm 20 years old
4My mom booted me off and proofread it
my family's good now too
but only because they have no clue how to kick me off the internet late at night
4She even went through my music and was deleting shit that may be offensive
O.o
wow
4Till I eventually verbally smacke dher
wow
That's even worse that some of the stuff my parents did
4Mostly becuase I got the music back in a nanosecond
4And I read fanfiction without anyone noticing
4Cuz I was amazing
4Eventually mom said 'fuck it'
4Dad never really cared...
4Let me do what i want
But it was my parents they would have just blocked everything with the word "fanfiction" or anything relating to the fandom I was reading fanfics for
Why'd you have to feed him to snakes?
Who said that?
4Yeah
Boris said it.
4But I knew my way around it
ah, Boris
I would use proxies
No, he doesn't even think that.
/me arrests Boris
I'm not defending him!
but not too often because they'd find out about those too
I'm just saying there wasn't any malice toward you or her.
4Yeah. I had severe depression issues back then
Well, you can think that then, Boris. I'm done with this conversation.
Same here, actually
4Like I would sit alone in my room, lights off, reading fanfiction with emo music playing
4I was super pale
in my depressed days my mom was like the only person I ever spoke to
4I never spoke to anyon
I spoke to people on the internet
I didn't talk to anyone. The Internet wouldn't judge me.
And my brother
4that was too mainstream
4I mean
4I almost cut my forehead before
4purposely
ouch, good thing you didn't
4To make it seem like I was Harry Potter
4I was retarded
o.o wait, really?
4Yeah
That would b worth it.
*be
4It would lol
imagine how people would react
4I remember I tried doing it with my fingernails in class
wouldn't be too hard to start conversations with strangers, on the bright side
4People thought I was doing an L
You walk into school: "Some creepy wizard tried to kill me, nbd."
haha
4haha yeah
he didn't even have a nose!
Freak!
4I dunno what brought me out of depression
me neither
lol
4But I was always depressed until this past year
I cut off his nose after he did it.
but I'm glad I'm out of it
4Then I was like
4'Fuck this dark emo shit I have been writing."
Mine's chronic, but it remisses at intervals.
4 600 words
4but 600 words of amazingness
Damn, I'm just about the only person here who's never had any problems with anything.
For me, honestly
Hahahahaha.
Haha, you're lucky
It was probably when I stopped talking to SR
hah
4HAHAHA
everything's his fault, lol
I'm talking to him right now
Dari: Well, quiet desparation is the English way, right?
4Red
hi
4Tell him everytrhing is his fault
Although when I was younger I cut myself because I thought it was cool.
sure if you want
:P
/FAIL
4Gas prices included
psst
he's too busy making himself rich
that's HIS fault?!
I'm not willing to disclose what I did. It was far too stupid.
/me punches SR in the nose
There we go lol
XD
Good thing I grew up.
4It's not as bad as reading Inuyasha fanfics
4I can tell ya that now
haha
I can only imagine
:P
You'd be surprised. :P
...LOL
Well, you know what I mean.
4Like
yeah I do
:P
Dari, are you 14 or 15?
you just have an inner child
4I can remember in one there was a surprise sex scene
as do I
15.
Ah
and I love that part of me
4I think I reached puberty at that moment
makes life fun
LOL
HAHAHAHA
4:D
what about it?
If you haven't already
buying it?
To see if we can get someone in charge who will actually do stuff
SR is clearly depressed because he doesn't have the Matter Destroyer app.
XDDDD
oh god
LOL
that was so funny
XD
I'm trying to format how to ask him about it
4hahahaha
Oh yeah, guys
Take that, Newton.
4REd
4Just be like
:P
4"Bitch, take care of your site or let me do it."
?
Oh yeah. XD
4No
Yes, which he should've sent!
4Tell me
Haaaah, that was brilliant.
4Tell me now
SAY WUUUUUT
I wrote a reply
As him
Where's the evidence?
it was hilarious
you were holding an android phone that said "That this, Newton!" on the screen
4TELL ME
Hahaha
Hmmmm
maybe
4I must laugh before I go to bed
I have the original
you can read mine if you'd like
Where can I upload them where no one will find them?
4Yush
:P
4under scraps
ah
Not penis.
good
PINGAS!
hmm
cause he's a creeper and all
Eh, upload it to imageshack where the link will disappear soon enough.
4send em to me via e-mail
Hmm
what's your email?
Sure
Oh, actually
My photobucket account is private
XxxdarkfrozenfingersxxX@lifeisvoid.com
So I'll screenshot and upload it there
4LOL
XD
:P
I'm going to create that domain now.
http://lifeisvoid.com
4Do it
LOL. Worth it.
4I'll join
I will if I remember.
Dari: I just might.
Cupcakes? D: FLEE! http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130626872839.gif
Hahaha, no
do tell
Who's Terra?
a newer OFF member
she or he?
4Who?
4What?
4OFF?
I can never keep track
Well, I joined this Guardians of Ga'Hool group like 3 and a half years ago, and just yesterday it was brought to my attention again because the group creator updated it.
Terra's a she, the one with the animated avatar of the guitar guy.
yeah
he's a Scott Pilgrim character
her avatar
and she has Deadpool and Harley Quinn in her sig
yeah?
4I enjoyed that there message
Anyway, I saw her there, commenting on one of the things. I only noticed that comment afterward, and she responded to something I said, but didn't have any idea it was me.
4Send it
thanks :P
we are not
4Yet
I by myself am a closet gay couple.
HOW DARE YOU I AM SO OFFENDED NO- oh wait
4:P
I and I am afraid that society won't approve of our orientation.
So I and I stay quiet about it.
Btw I uploaded the letter
4Minnisota is voting against gay marriage now
PM me if you want it
Nope. I was considering making her upset but decided against it.
Queen of the TL;DR posts, Scourge's Daughter, is at it again... -_-
LOL
Not a picture of ponies BTW: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130629244383.jpg
4LOL
4WTF
LOL
wtf
only you dari :P
Hahahaha.
4I am so saving that picture
o_o
why?! XD
4It's amazing
4That's why
If you say so :P
Reminds me of an oldy but a goodie: http://romston.com/wp-posts/11-01-09-Sarah_Palin_brainless_invisible_dicks/Sarah_Palin_brainless_invisible_dicks_Img01.png
4If I could
4I would have that as my SF avatar
SF still exists? D:
No
it does
I have begun going back
It's a hallucination
Right dari?
like RDX?
Yeah
Exactly
4Yeah
the rest of us are all real, right?
We're all real
I know (*THINK D: ) I'm real
except RDX and you
wait
why me?
Because you asked
Of course
I've been here all along
Am I real?
huh what?
ohhh
I'm a hallucination
I should pinch myself to be sure.
I'm not here
Oooh, that feels good.
you are a hallucinatipm
errr
I'm going to continue.
*hallucination
4Ok
4I am gonna go to bed
you do that
4I have to get up in the morning
4One more week of school
oh nice
See ya
then freedom!
/me does a William Wallace cheer
One thing before you go.
WAR
WAR
4Then life buttfucking me
4Like SR and Red
XD what a classy exit
One more week? He should count his blessings!
o.o he's going to get punched for that next time he's here
I'm in pris -- school until the 21st of June. :/
Ouch
what're ya in fer?
Domestic violence.
oh right
the eating them all thing
Who knew cannibalism homicide was illegal?
/me shrugs
I sure didn't.
why am I the evil one?
I forgot to give dari credit for his part of the letter
?
no idea
New wallpaper: check.
you mean?
Lawn duties completed: check.
Solve world hunger: check
Tell no one...
None shall know of it my lord
not even I
for I am already oblivious
12nooo
You've been watching too many movies
Good. Perhaps your usefulness hasn't yet completed its course.
I actually haven't really been watching any lately
NO. SUCH. THING.
xP
Anyone care to watch Barowl either get really butthurt or laugh?
:O
While we wait, an amusing image from our sponsors.
haha
is it happening on OFF?
http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/227102_10150187167908492_559688491_7126680_7897171_n.jpg
Yes. I'm just waiting for his response. He's already angry with me for disagreeing with him in the philosophy thread.
yeah he has no plans to develop the forum any further
nor does he want to
Big surprise
no financial opportunity in it
Was he at least open to letting someone else do it?
nope
BO needs to make his move before I get him in check.
holy crap scourge's post really is TL;DR
I didn't even attempt it.
same
I mean, I have some fairly lengthy posts in one topic, but it's so I could adress every side of the argument.
She just likes to type.
yeah
Heya LL
And goodbye LL :P
Wild Barowl fled!
hmn..
/me sighs.
he did say that if anyone can come up with a good design that he likes he might consider changing it
Well good luck impressing Mr. Master Web Designer
heh
"I don't desing, I do the back end stuff"
*design
well yeah, but have you seen the pages he's made?
but as for the mod settings and him not being around the answer is "you guys can more then handle it"
wow
Yeah, we can totally handle activating people's accounts and adding people to groups, which we don't even have the rights to do
Makes perfect sense
He could at least take those features off if he's not going to be around to manage them
I say you convert the forum into a brothel.
It's already on its way.
XD
Baaaaad idea :P
C'mon. There's your financial viability.
we already have myspace for that
I'll see if I can convince him to alter permissions
:P
Okay, the name of this article alone is funny: Brisk Walking Helps Prostate Patients.
12nom
I don't even need to read it.
yay a got him to do something
now let's see if he does it
What is he doing?
supposedly giving us permissions to activate users and add to grpus
"groups"
Ah
Yeah
I doubt it'll happen
15% chance he actually does it
yep
oh hey
but yeah as for anything else it has no financial gain and as of such it is of no relative importance to him
he did something
I just got added to the fanfiction usergroup
Woah, I just got demoted to a group called "Possible Forum Members."
haha
He's still not sure if you're from his forum?
Oh, I have no idea. I was just kidding.
I haven't even talked to the guy about it since he said those infamous words.
yeah he says we can add users to groups now
:P
that was so funny though
Yeah, but he never really responded.
he has me in the group "Who the hell is THIS guy?"
LOL
That would be every member
LOL true
Oh, and probably LoneKnight
Owlpages still hasn't wirtten back.
lol I forgot all about him
My memory is foggy, but wasn't there also someone literally named Spyro?
Yeah
He was the first mod
Who HAS A LIFE
Who Neal?
lol
oh yeah
That's like
that guy is a freaking tool
All he ever talked about
my first ever post on SF was correcting him
I'M LATE BECAUSE I HAVE A LIFE YOU'RE ALL SO UNGRATEFUL
for saying "anyways"
I'M SORRY BUT YOU ALL CAN'T EXPECT ME TO COMPETENTLY DO MY JOB AS A MODERATOR WHEN I HAVE AN AUSPICIOUS TRACK MEET TO ATTEND.
Yo!
hi
Hey
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Faaaaaat Albert.
but yeah he still wont give the fucking thing up to somebody else
stubborn bastard
Why the hell not?
He clearly doesn't care about it
@pony
Makes no sense
because it doesn't need to be under new ownership
that's the only reason he needs
Well
what's up?
I have to disagree with him on that one
it's quite simple
Big people business. Wanna go play darts?
if it doesn't involve money then it doesn't interest him
why he keeps it then
I don't know
too prideful to give it away prolly
ooh, darts
I'm in!
/me scampers off.
D:
nobody wants to play darts with me *sniff*
Seriously
If it wouldn't be awkward as hell for me to talk to him
I'd ask him myself how much he'd sell it for
oh yeah
Oooh, let me do it. He doesn't even know me, apparently.
he also says "Don't be afraid to come talk to me"
as usual
I'll just be an anonymous messenger.
What, he says that to me?
Or you
about all of us
oh
dude
we don't talk to you because you don't give a crap what we have to say
unless it involves money
And you're Canadian.
and for forum growth
his answer is
Make sure to involve that he's Canadian.
yeah, and since we don't have the buckets of money he needs to be interested
"forums grow by members inviting more people."
Nothing will ever happen
Well that's true
But that's not the only way
not so uch in this case
this is a forum based upon a franchise
If everything else about the forum sucks, no one will stay
it runs more on just popularity then friends inviting each other
Speaking of forums
I have half a mind to start an MLP forum
I've always wanted my own forum
or whatever little popularity is left in Spyro
this could be the official channel or whatever
/me throws a dart at RDX by accident.
I don't understand why he would continue to pay for hosting if it's so insignificant to him
ouch
idk
probably doesn't even notice however much it costs disappearing every month, though
That could be the forum you and I have been meaning to start for over a year now :D
you'll never get a straight answer out of him
but it's quite simply just his pride
he wont ever give up something that HE owns or created
Le seriously.
there will be repercussions (sp?) for such an act!
anything other then what is his is a travesty
Slap the nucka widda pan. All's your problems are solved.
/me slaps SR widda pan, solving all's the problems.
Hahaha
lol
Peels here!
oh well
/me solves more problems
it's like
I'm proud of myself I got him to change ONE thing
YAY
I know one thing.
we've talked about this so many times
I'm grabbin' peeels.
and every time
I come out thinking "Why do I even care?"
Because deep down you have an eternal flame of love for Sr, of course.
*SR
Senior
For Sr, maybe
your'e playing with fire buddy
For SR, no
who's Sr?
Eternal flame of love for a Senior citizen.
my nickname is not Senior
:P
You're missing the point. >.<
/me listens to the crowd OOOOOOOOH
OOHHH AH OH OH OH OH AH
Now you've driven me to use stupid faces.
MUUUUUUFFINSSSSS
I will avenge.
brb
o.=.o
like this?
haha
You're a dwaggie
no im nooottttttttt
or wait
*autoignored by dari*
on second thought
don't
im cynders lover
DESU
baka
that is all i am and will ever b
umm
It's ok
the world will now end on October 21st
then we don't have to worry about it
what other auto ignores are there for dari?
me an cyndur r in lezbians with eachuther
kawaii! <3
oh and he put the previous owner of SFA in charge of the wiki
cynder likes me becuz im a thunder dwagon
and is hoping to get the rights to his site
o my gawsh ur volteer!!!!
YES
now u understahns
Why?
i will bow down 2 u nao
I thought he didn't care
no need for dat
so he can "revive" it
or so he says
but
all i need is cyndur
o i srry
why does he care about that
back
no idea
And not fixing what he has already
hai mikee
wutup :3
well according to him HIS site runs perfectly
Sure it does
Shoot, I should be asleep.
Ok, I'm gonna stop talking like that now
But I'm still enteratained...
*entertained
ok fain
he is sick of some of the members who post on it though
ill keep dooin it
I don't blame him for that
nga plz
i dont need U
I'm sick of pretty much everyone on there
yeah
Which again begs the question
"Why do I care?"
everyone who isn't here right now
because we are all that is left of what was once a very good userbase?
unless you;re serious
Hardly. xD
How about this
Screw SF
And we'll start another forum somewhere else
There's our userbase
:D
:D
can I be part?
NO
Eh, not a viable option. Migrations never go well.
D':
Not a Spyro forum though
throw you in our trunk
as long as it's not about ponies I'm ffine
and drive right there
lol
hahaha
too late
What should it be about
My dad's a cop! He'll make you PAAAAAAY
*?
we already be schemin'
xD
No reason we can't have two
dwaggies
Ponies better not be brought up...
i say dwaggies
What's a common interest we all have?
Um,
Besides Spyro
You got me there
video games
but that's too general
eh
yeah
Too many of those already
The Internetz
we all have slightly different tastes
A forum about the internetz
interesting
haha
:P
It's brilliant.
Oh, a forum about forums
isn't that basically what Reddit is?
Forumception?
Pretty much.
We'll make a site like that.
Except we
Forumception
nice
dude
*Except we'll call it "Breadit"
And it'll be about bread.
speaking of forumception AND of Reddit
I found a great image on Reddit today
http://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/
one sec
XD nice
...I was kidding.
Oh my God. xD
here it is
http://iloveimages.tumblr.com/post/5795074285
yes and the shore he washes up on is shutter islind
dun dun DUN
but secretly hes a gangsta from new yawk
and also one from Boston
well, undercover cop
technically
He's really matured as an actor,.
I used to hate him.
yeah, he has
Ever since The Departed I've enjoyed his acting.

Today has been a quiet day
yep
Suggestive Winky Face will escort me out.
Toodles.
XD
see ya
toaster
All toasters toast toast
Yeah toast!
That's what they say
that they do
Everywhere I go from coast to coast
people always ask me what I like the most
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
I just tell 'em: I like toast
so yeah
phyrric victory I suppose
phyrric?
yes
what does that mean?
read up on your history :P
Ohh
A Phyric victory is when a winners losses are more then his gains
"A Pyrrhic victory ( /p?r?k/) is a victory with devastating cost to the victor; it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately cause defeat."
History nerd being told to read up on history
this isn't the history I read :P
too bad I can't spell it
history is very vast
anyways least I got him to change something
I only know bits of it
now I guess you have to start working on a design :P
Me?
Hell no
anyone lol
Unless he pays me
I sure as hell cant
/me never designed a forum before
I wonder if I even know how without using bad practices
No
I can guarantee you that you don't
ok, I won't even try then
If you're talking about writing the code, at least
or the BOXING DAY image
no, I just mean the layout
oh
then maybe
but
like deciding what looks acceptable
not the actually coding
I'm sure SR wouldn't accept just an image of what it should look like
He'd want code
Or he'd be forced to spend time on it himself
yeah, and I have little to no web design experience
"If someone creates a professional design that is not done in mspaint and I like it, I will attempt to change the design."
What if it's done in MSpaint and it's good?
:P
:P
I just want to make a troll design in MS paint now
Hahaha
something that lloks like a 4 year old did it
and PM it to him
change all the forum icons to a troll face
XD
make spyro but with a purple forever alone face
Wait
but he said he will "attempt" to change it
he might attempt for five minutes
and then get bored
leaving it worse than before
heh, yeah
blarg
I'm about to start that one
I felt bad for twilight sparkle
Fail.
No sleep again. Can't sleep. >__>
I had that problem last night
I only got like 4 hours
I hate the feeling of not being able to sleep

aaaaand
Now
Ahh.
I promise to not keep you up
I have ponies on my iPod for when I can't sleep
but I'm playing RDR again :P
Hahaha
nice
I have Pokemanz
Hahahaha.
I can't play it anymore - I know I'll want the unicorn too much.
I talked about it with a coworker today
and between that and talking to you about it
I just HAD to play it
wow, I was way off
Well it takes 2 minutes to ping out.
oh yeah
derp
:P
actually no

in this game I was riding my horse
minding my own business
when all of a sudden I ran stright off a cliff
Wheeeeeee.
It's fun to fly off the highest points in the game.
thankfully it was a short drop
like tunsis the driving cat
though I have had times when it kills the horse and I survive
or
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQkL9LpvKl0
when you're at the bottom of the clip
Cliff
and your horse is at the top
you whistle for it
You know what they were?
and the damn thing walks off the cliff and kills itself
what are they?
Seagulls, when you shoot them they bounce up out of the water for about the next 5 minutes.
ohhh
haha
I thought they were fish jumping around. DX

what
I KIND OF LIKE IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S JUST LIKE /WHAT/
wait wait wait
I just got to the end
this is for real?!
not fan made?!
yes this is a real commercial
It has ponies.
I like it.
ponies will make anything better, eh?
Pretty much.
I LOVE PONIES! <3
dari wants the my little pony underwear
To go with my Rainbow Dash shoes, hell yeah.
dari I have seriously never seen how much of a fanboy you can be until recently
WHO ARE YOU
I can't help it, LOVE PONIES T_T
It's actually quite annoying.
XDDD
it was only a week ago that you didn't even want to admit liking it
or maybe two weeks ago
I forget
I've done stuff excessively (like play games), but I was never a fanboy, and I wouldn't ever talk about it much.
This is annoyingly new to me.
XD
Hahaha
DAMN YOU PONIES!
I always ramble about the stuff I obsess over
I actaully have to try really hard to control myself
Hahaha.
oh crap
NOW I just ran straight into a river
LOL
and killed both me and my horse
*license
You're doing it wrong.
:P
I can drive just fine
:P
just not ride ponies
I'm kidding
I know :P
actually, in games with cars I'm like a bat outta hell
GAMES WITH CARS
I like seeing HOW bad of accidents I can cause
XDDD
sounds like me
I'm going to tone down the ponies. I don't want to turn into another one of those annoying fan 'people' things.
THESE GAMES DONT HELP ME PREPARE AT ALL
hahaha
dari don't worry about it your not that bad haha
nah, stay the way you are

some people have highlights for a reason
so that kinda isn't a fix
12we have no evidence he has a reason
I have it so I know when people are trying to get hold of me.
12now we do
if people have turned on highlights, that usually implies they had a reason for doing so.
so it should be a reason until proven otherwise
I could probably exclude just that line from highlighting me anyway.

Your parents have anything to say about you watching MLP?
4Nope
Hahaha.

4I infected a friend though
Oh, nice.
4To the point where she was pissed at me becuase she was drawing ponies
my family HAS NO IDEA
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA COME OUT TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT BEING A BRONY????
nevar!
XD
I told my mum that the show had become popular with people between the ages of 18-34 and she didn't believe me, she just thought it was weird. I think she also said at least once "Well at least you don't have to worry about anything like that".
Fail.
Complete and utter fail.
XD
wait, what did she mean by that?
That I'd never get into a show like that.
XD
IF SHE ONLY KNEW
Hahaha.
4It's like coming out of the closet
4Srsly, no one at first believes you
No coffee for me?
4and then the truth sets in
4Mostly for parents
XDD
I was watching the finale and my mom was running late for work and she looks out of the bathroom and goes
"AWW--- ...wait is this my little pony?"
"eeheeeheee YES it's the season finale"
"...ah...I didn't know you liked...this show..."
then she walked into the other room
hahahahahahahaha
and it was awkward
Lawl.
