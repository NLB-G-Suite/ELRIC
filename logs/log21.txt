03NVIDIA 160M

And he doesn't seem to be doing anything about that member's account either
03yay military grade components?
Nah
12Some things apple makes are crappy though, like the iPad
03Correction
nvidia doesn't make motherboards, they do, howeve, make onboard graphics

He likes LAZ0R people too.
Amazing...buttons
03THe ZunePad is fricking awesome
and it's only because I'm a conservative
03it's like a scroll wheel,e xcept it actually makes sense
03up is up, down is down
03who would have thought
Wow.

12iPods. iPods EVERYWHERE
I have no idea
03I've tried iPods at the apple store
He never made any sense
03right, back to the fact of the matter, MacBook Air is possibly the worst laptop ever made.
^yer doing it wrong
That reminds me when someone sent you a PM on Valentine's day ages ago, oh the speculation.
:D

And showed it to spyrochat

03they come stock with an i7
03and like a NVIDIA dedicated card
That is from 2005 <3
03i7s FTW, don't be hating
i7s are fun
but you don't use it properly
12Actually, I don’t have the ‘best’ budget. But a pretty good one
03why, just because I have hyperthreading?
Till the other i7 users hate on you
not only that
was it just some random person or something?
;D
03well how much are you looking to spend?
orly
because you don't use the cpu much, either
there was a riddle
12Around $800
03you can't get ANY Macbook for that price
did you ever figure it out?
12More then likely
Yeah
03right either way
03I'm going now

LOL
+a*
;D
whats the THICKNESS!
03before I go
03the only thing I don't like about that ThinkPad
03is that you have to get a SSD
03As much as that's cool
03I'd rather have like a 500GB normal hard drive
03XDC
03-C
03if they made a 15" version
03LOL
03no
LolSSD/
03for me it is
0315.4" is ideal for laptops
03IMHO
I'm 1.3 in off :P
thats because you intend to turn any laptop into a media hub. which they aren't
03no
But Junh..
03that's because I like being able to see the screen without straining my eyes
My laptop IS my media hub
03the ability to watch high def videos is also aplus :P
12I like 0.1 size screens :D
i was referring to the HD
XD
durf
i use a 17"
03anyway
but i've used a 10.1 and it was okay enough
03NOW bbl

you can clear it
There's no way you could see it through the router
I could clear it from my computer, but that would do nothing
It would already be in the access log or whatever
do yourself a favor and don't do anything SR says
it's either BS or illegal
Heya Rora
and SR said that's bs?
He said there would be no way anyone could see the websites I've been to through the router
yeah right
without actually going to my computer and looking at my history
if you have wireshark you could do it
by seeing where the packets are coming and going

You could unlpug the router, might clear temporary memory.

Barowl is talking about food again. :/
We could do with some more people.
Yeah, but no one there is actually entertaining to talk to unless they're being trolled.
I wouldn't want to bring a bunch of noobs/immature kids to the network.
Excluding myself, of course. :P
Still, it might help spread the word around
And the noobs would probably only stay in the one channel anyway
As long as they were contained I suppose it can't hurt.
But how to advertise, seeing as it's forbidden to do publicly...
just to pitch in
They won't be able to work out how join other cahnnels.
I agree that you should try getting it

Hey, it happens to everyone. :P
02:P
03what money
lmfao
13Ray needs to procrastinate moar
02NUUUUU.
02Homework, now.
6I'm the best procrastinator ever
6mainly because I only work under pressure
03XD
World's longest battle?
13^
6ok well
6I can't beat that
02^
6I just procrastinate literally up to the last possible minute
13I give myself a time to start working, then I say "I'll do it in half an hour"
02Then again, ^
6see
6to make a nature study book
6she gave us a month and a half
6didn't finish them, only did minimal layout for credit
Hahaha, I used to do the same with all school projects.
6I always do this lol
Always waited for the last minute; always aimed for the minimum.
13my teacher kept telling me I was gonna fail
It would be complete trash if someone didn
*didn't
03usually I just end up failing ;.;
6manly, you're in monterey right?
Across the bay, lol.
6...close enough lol, but nvm then
I have no idea why care though =/
well it's a good thing you were there to take care of it
6but lol nvm
eh
I guess because of the memories
/me does homework
6what town?
Yeah, I guess
6salinas- wait no that's further
Castroville. "Articoke Center of the World."
hard to let go of something after 6 years
6LOL CASTROVILLE
Yeah.
6because artichokes
6fields upon fields upon fields
6its practically non existant
6I thought hollister was bad enough
Pretty much, haha.
well
maybe the kid in me still enjoys the memory of Spyro lol
6I seriously need to go to the boardwalk sometime soon
6I usually go like 6-9 times a summer
6didn't go AT ALL last year
6strike that, went once
6as a spur of the moment
It's a fun place.
I'm trying to get a job there.
6how was the 30 thousand+ people at the concert a couple weeks ago lol
yeah, that too
Wait, how do you know about that? xD
6dude
but I'm getting really sick of this blandness
Because games aren't made that well any more.
I really have no interest in that
neither do I
@pony
12prince_dari is 5Doctor Whoo11v5ves
Whoo. (:
6.......LOL
Now I'm googling it, cause I seriously didn't know about any concert.
that and the blandess of the site
it needs a makeover
SR likes you
Easy, right? :P
RDX's face when I come on and talk about ponies: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130569271562.gif
LOL
haha
6the going away thing for the american idol competitor
yeah right
6I guess everyone thought for sure he'd make the top three,
6which american idol then films their last songs at their hometowns
6but he got sent home as the 4th
I haven't talked to him in a few months
6just no filming
6I'm willing to bet the majority of that crowd thought for sure the film crews would be there
He was planning on getting some old Spyro site and redirecting it to SF I think.
For more traffic.
Yeah, SFA
I don't know why he'd bother, though
It's just an old proboards site
oh that old thing
didn't know people still used it
http://spyro.conforums3.com/
the most recent post was last week
lol
Yeah, lots of unique traffic there
/me hugs Kitten and Emmi
Just because people don't post there doesn't mean it isn't getting traffic.
216 members
6really
well that's all well and good but we still need some changes
maybe we could buy it from him or something
eh
I don't know
last I talked to him about that he said he would never sell it
6loool
well as much as I don't like this Skylanders junk if it can bring some acitivity to the forum I'm all for it
As long as it's not all little kids like LoS brought us
Ugh, that was annoying
If you bought it from him you'd have to pay for hosting though.
Except for you, RDX
lol
You were like the only non-annoying member to join during that time XD
eh I had my moments
03woah
03one of my mom's friends has tickets to be in the pit of a NASCAR race
at least the Forum had more mature members then
03and he's offering them to me
to counter balance the stupidity
I didn't think of that
6omg do it
03yeah
Hm.
03making sure the offer is still good
Same could be said for forum updates
6manly, do it and i can totally come visit
/me 6runs
03I might try to sneak in my HD camcorder XD
it's still running off the old phpbb
I still have a hard time believing it was real
the movie I mean
Lol.
Did they ever even make a trailer?
no
03yay, Welcome to Detroit is on the radio
But from a financial standpoint
03It was my favorite for like
03a year
They made a poster for it.
it was about as real as Jamique or whatever his name was
yeah
But for Spyro?
Very few have actually been completed though.
Spyro isn't popular at all anymore
And those that were failed.
No one would watch it
Mostly.
03but not quite sure why it was necessary to make it into a picture
03especially since they mixed the order up LOL
led people on about that shit for five years
yep you have
the most he had to show was a couple of really shitty looking drawings
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ground-zero-ad-fail.jpg
You're putting too much pressure on him!
6that picture is HORRIBLE LOL
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/epic-fail-photos-ad-fail.jpg
03that is awesome
Yeah, like at least that registration thing
Red...Cupcake.
NOT WANT!
D:
lol Ratchet is part of that forum
SFA?
yeah
haha
Thos pictures. lmfao
or at least he was active on it at one point
Does TTE even do anything anymore?
and WOW they actually got images for their freaking ranks
http://i56.tinypic.com/14jrr42.jpg
TTE?
Oh.
LOOOOOOOL
LOL.
6lololol
Jackson117 is part of it too
Epic rage quit.
lol
I found a post by TTE
it says
6"come see us may 22nd"
Cynder is a "censored"
LOL
03XD
wow
Hahaha. XD
I think that's actually where ratchet came from
Do either of you go on DS, how are they doing in comparison with SF?
Hah, fai;
*fail
eh
I don't go on there much
DarkSpyro is really active
But all the activity is crap
Active with morons
but still active
because they can do whatever they want there
02Lmfao Manly
they dont' have mods
Oh.
Fail.
simply put
I like the way the site is set up
Most Spyro fans seem to be around 9 to 14
it's just run like shit
"We could buy the site off SR" - this is starting to sound like plotting revolution again. XD
LOL
Haha, no thanks
I missed the first revolution
^ Same.
I just heard about it.
You missed both of them
I think
Both?
yeah
There were two?
oh yeah
forgot you had two
yeah
I got there just after the second one
We were drama queens
Doppel lead the first one right?
No
Oh.
The first one was in like '07
I pretty much lead both of them -.-
Hahaha. XD
while trying to date SR at the same time :P
XD
Lawl.
Doppel joined after both of them
I think he tried to start a third one, but it didn't work out
O__o
The first one was me, Klone, and some more of our friends
Can't remember when I joined.
I think I used the IRC for about a year before I made an account.
you just joined randomly one day when we pushed you to do it lol
03well
03I gotta go work out at the gym now
03so bbl
The second one was me, Klone, DragonSpiritPT, and DarkCynder
*plays Punch Out/Rocky music*
03XD
And I guess you could count Zekira
03yeah anyway
yeah
Aww, all the drama.
If you joined around when #spyrochat was made, you missed them both
Damn the history of SF is colourful.
Lol.
He was involved in both
Trying to get us to stop
he was gone before I shoed up
StormKnight 4EVAH! :P
XD
then we've got Razz
LOL RAZZ
I forgot about that
lol
Worship plzl.
well she had the personality of a toothpick
but at least she attracted people to the forum
Why did she leave? XD
People stopped worshipping her?
ehhehhehe
Oh, hey Rurik.
she and SR had a falling out
4Sup peeps
Lol, reminds me of Bluefusion.
She was picking on DDR in a thread
I went a little too far standing up for him
it was all blown out of proportion
She got really offended and announced that she was leaving everywhere
Lawl.
Razztards - rise UP!
4who?
We're talking about Razz
Going through the history of SF
4Oh
4She overcharges her commisions on DA. Not even that good
that's how she makes her living
cept dress up at those freaking comic cons or whatever
Lol.
oh darn
4Pass
it was all blown out of proportion
he hasn't been back since
4I saw him back once a few months ago
4Spyro is a dip
4really, he is
he runs a campground
that's living?
4I'm actually making a full recovery
4should be 100% in Sept
Oh, I thought you were going to say you were pregnant.
:P
good to know
that's great
:)
yes yes
4anyway
4DUH
4I'm not a mod
lol it says you are
4for fucking RP. That part can die
4Nothing i say or do makes them smarten up
nothing we say does either lol
I'll talk to SR and find out what's up
4Pft
4Good luck getting him to respond
I know how to make him talk
4Sweet nothings?
hahaha, that sounded evil
it's easy
You want free l4z0rz and money?
just start the convo with either something insulting Liberals or Lazors
lol
4lmao
or yes Dari, money
XD
LOL
4Oh and giving me the site
eh last I checked he was gonna pay me money to get him some hosting opportunities
lol

/me wants next series of ponies.
Episode with Derpy. :D
Would suck if they ruined her though.
There's not really anything to ruin
outside of the personality fanfiction has probably given her
"Derpy" wouldn't make sense to the average 7 year old girl
Meh.
You were there...
huh?
You suggested it in face. :P
You mean where it said "EVIL DOER!"
I wasn't paying attention
fact*
sarcasm no longer has a place in this world
it still is, by the way
I know it is
It opens "draconicwolves.com!!"
Idc if it works or not on here really
Is anyone here?
:(
nothing was they're just obssessed with ponies now
no

connecting to BNCs is fine

Eh, my friend bugs me a lot, but she's still my friend XP

Yes X3

I got sacred back

and I have another server from leaseweb

and 1GB of RAM

/me needs to find out how you get all of these for free

I heard about her
haven't actually gone to her page yet though
You know how she's not working on the show anymore?
oh wow
4I knew she was off
4but no idea why
Now all the comments on her dA journal are "Congratulations on the baby!"
4oooh
Haha
4That would explain it
yeah, it would
maybe she'll come back in a few years then
Season 2 is already mostly done, apparently
Rurik: yeah, I hate when that happens
happens to movies a lot
*cough* Harry Potter
haha, yeah
that's one good example
4I dunno
4I liked the 6th movie
but 3 and 4 I particularly disliked
4I liked both of those
well, not disliked
4I liked all except one actally lol
Haha
4first one
4But Rowling is making 8, 9, and 10 now

I would have been done within half an hour of starting

Heheh.
4:D
4The show is great
/me flops
isn't it?
Well, I hope the bandwagon loses a wheel soon.
you have to get a few episodes in, but it does get good
And crashes into a ditch.
oh?
eh
I think it'd solve the Open Discussion cluttering and random chatter that doesn't need to stay on the forum.
I don't know if OFF needs one
most of the "random chatter" is in night flight and that's always been around...
If you look around nearly every topic has gone off onto tangents.'
well then we can work on enforcing more rules, getting one of the admin's to post a public reminder to stay on topic?
Well, we were talking about this here earlier
We thought it could bring more people for epic-chat
I don't see how it'd be a hassle
If you think about it, we've been telling people not to go off-topic for years and it's never really stuck.
I think it'd be easier to get to know everyone that way too
I certainly know all you guys more from here than SF or OFF
Mhm. The only thing I'm worried about is people spilling in from #owlfantasy into here...
well I gotta go to the store, be back later
vulcan and crew
They won't be able to work out how to join other channels. :P
Annoying people like Ayumi popping up every minute
haha
replace Ayumi with Ammeg and tada!
OFF IRC
@Dari: Some of them are actually pretty competent, and they could easily teach the noobs how to hop channels.
4Eww
4Ayumi
jk at my last comment
4I dunt want more Wolfaboos
xD I was about to say. Textbook ragequit.
Ammeg may be annoying
LOL
That word.
I like it.
but she's no Ayumi
I agree, but he was good for laughs
Ancient Winds is worse.
yeah AW can be bad too
4I can tell I am gonna have a lot of fun cutting em down
I personally am glad pianomaestro never seems to be there
he always annoyed me
Hahaha
FU
Yes
exactly
:P
:P
4Or
4'I'm a wolf.'
He certainly made Dances With Wolves enjoyable when we watched it

ahahaha
4Seriously
4He makes people with Aspergers look retarded
that was a buffalo
oh yeah
XD
4LOLWUT
some buffalo was hit by an arrow in the movie
but you couldn't see the arrow
it looked like it just flat out died
rage quit
and threw the wiimote
4Oh
which killed the buffalo
4Good man
but for some reason this was changed before the movie was released

Hello diul up
Nyan
I'm far more useful than last year's model.
RDX didn't come back
Haha
My bad :P
I'm not surprised. He was really pissed off.
he probably just hasn't been by his computer since it pinged out
working or something
I was wrong again
He just hates us
except rurik
Because he's talking to him
4Yeah, he hates you guys
4Like
4He's actually pissed off
wait, really?
D:
if he is I'm really sorry
I don't mean to piss anyone off
I could tell you guys were pushing him last night.
4Yeah
But I think hate is a bit of an exaggeration.
4That's kinda why I stopped and resorted to barely coming on here today
4That and talking to people
I didn't expect him to get mad about something like that
I didn't even realize
I didn't think he would either
Doesn't seem like him
4Well
He always acts like he's mad like that
4You guys did go off continoiously
to me at least
4when he asked you multiple times to stop
4I picked up right on it
4Not last night
4but today I did
See, if I had gotten a direct "Stop talking about ponies now" I would have realized
heh
Yeah, it really didn't seem clear to me either
4Ha
4Well
4Now we know
like I said he always acts that way to me
Yeah
4He says he doesn't care about if we like it
4but to take it to another channel
Or to ponychan.
4Cupcakes
I could tell he was a little annoyed at it, which was why I suggested the other channel
But not that he was seriously pissed off about it
I can see the misunderstanding, because he just has that crass personality where he acts like he hates everything.
Yeah
Exactly
4WEll, you didn't hear it from me
[22:46] <+Neon> I can see the misunderstanding, because he just has that crass personality where he acts like he hates everything. Exactly my point
we would've stopped
It seemed like you guys knew he was perturbed, though, especially when you guys said you were going to talk about it more because RDX said he hated it.
well, I knew he was annoyed
but not pissed
not enough to leave
Fair enough.

probably
Ponies I hope
English.

I'll write about ponies.
You should
have any?
here were mine
[23:17] <+Lambda> "Friendship is magic, and we've got a lotta magic here."
[23:17] <+Lambda> or
[23:17] <+Lambda> "That rainbow one kicked me."
o_O
I don't know.
:D
I'm already owner on 2 channels
I omly am on 1
Can't believe RDX actually got annoyed.
I thought he was just playing along.
me either
like, only me and Channy there
me either
he always pretends to be mad
XD
haha
Clearly he's just too manly for ponies (or not enough, heheheh).
it even got Rurik
Yeah, I was impressed by that.
this channel
The problem is it doesn't necessarily get you by the first few episodes you watch.
yeah
O_o
like him at first
then, and I quote
"I'm going to watch episode 3"
next thing you know
Hahaha.
[23:03] <+Rurik> on episode 11
LOL
Ponies are magic.
hmm
that might make a good topic right there
mm?
Yes, I'll do that in a minute
just us 3 and rurik?
Oh, ChanServ's female now?
Channy's been female as long as I can remember
This channel is going to be vulerable enough to trolls as it is
but she loves MrBot
XD
:P
and dari
I forget how the story went
I know there's at least one gay couple in there somewhere
Something like that
Hahaha, nice
nice touch, the last episode part
I like that
That'll be more useful when season 2 comes out
yeah
All I talk about on IRC is ponies now.
me too
it's weird
oh dari
Yeah?

epic-chat.net contains no active threats

Good to know
yep
12back
Haha
Ponies.
Discuss.
it would get WAY crowded if we did that
:P
That could be another way to bring more people to the network...
Hmm.
I've been lurking a lot
NETWORK TRAFFIC OVERLOAD!
It seems like a nice community for the most part
yeah, I get that too
they do seem friendly
I'm just clueless about *chans
same
ponychan is good because they don't allow porn.
"Where are the threads!"
*?!
It took me a while for me to work out that you had to click reply to open them. XD
oh you do?
that makes sense
I figured that out when I was lurking 888chan during their "raid"
I thought there just were no threads
haha
That'd be pretty cool.
it seemed annoying to me
Do you have a tripcode or whatever, dari?
Damn
tripcode?
It's the closest thing to registration there is on chans
oh
haha
probably ignore it
Somehow, even though all I'm talking about is ponies, I can't say "anypony" it just seems...Too far. XD
honestly
dari: same here
it might get overlooked or ignored
Which board would you post on?
probably /www/
Fair enough.
seems like it would fit best there
Yeah.
you don't think that if it did work it would get too crowded here?
I kinda like just the three-five of us
Honestly, epic-chat really needs traffic though.
We have draconicwolves for that
not for pony talk though
(nopony :P)
Right now it's just the same as DW only minus RDX
And yeah, this network could really use some more people
I guess, but like it's nice talking to just you guys about ponies
I dunno
:P
:P
Most of the ponychanners are pretty nice.
They are

bbl
bbl
Hmm.
Never thought of that.
XD at the outfit Rarity made for Rainbow Dash
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qhM8gtL8Hs
hahaha
there's a part where yu herd cattly and it's exactly like this
*you
I've played it. :P
I wasn't sure
it is
one that I've been meaning to play again
rainbow dash looks awesome with goggles
Yeah, it kept me busy for a while.
me too
I did all the survival challenges
even picking all the flowers
nice
I'm looking forward to it
I think I finished just about all of the offline.
same
none of the online however
But some of the online achievements were too hard.
my ethernet port in my room is busted
I really couldn't be bothered to get the highest level or whatever.
haha, I imagine
but they eat everything else
XD
XD Owned.
In RDR.
I can't remember
I might've missed a few side quests
Yeah, he was pretty interesting.
do you remember where he's at?
hmm
it's a recurring one then
Yeah.
I'd be surprised if you hadn't done it.
I probably have
You say "Damn you", and he says "Many do".
huh
interesting
yeah, I actually do think I must've missed that one
Hm.
Well it's good, you should do it.
I know I missed a few
I'll be sure to
yeah
That's strange.
judging by the sound of it I bet not
just haven't played it in a while
Oh, cool.
http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/14320288/images/rdr_0847.jpg
Oh, it is him.
I haven't then
he doesn't look familiar
I found a RD wiki though
I can find out where the first side quest with him is
Haha
it's called
I Know You
fitting
Yeah.
starts in hennigan's stead
yeah
oops
I should stop reading about this
:P
it's interesting though!
^woah
Yep.
tomorrow after wotk
and playing it again
and coming on here of course
Heheheh.
Lol.
FILLYDELPHIA
HAHAHAHA
:P
The vastness of RDR is amazing.
yeah it is
more games need that
And some of the scenery could actually be considered beautiful.
*eventually
yeah they do
I've sat staring at canyons and mountains for like ten minutes at time
*times
Spyro Rockstar style, LOL.
Hahahaha!
that would be interesting
XD
or Spyro Noire
LOL
/me hasn't played L.A. Noire yet
too many ponies
I've just seen adverts, looks pretty good.
yeah, it does
oh wow
dun dun DUN
wasn't me this time
I also like the statistics they give you in RDR.
yeah
this is a long shot but
or not a long shot
a bold statement
anyway
I liked GTA IV
I haven't played that many GTA games.
but all the GTA's before that I didn't care for like most people do
while trying to make enough money for he and his cousin to survive
Hahahaha
took me a while just to get the one
Hahaha.
I think I always missed the train
Yeah, the train was annoying to catch.
I remember trying to do that very clearly
when I first got RDR I went to a friend's house to playing
we must've been up 24 hours straight playing it that day
Wow.
:P
man, I really want to play it now
Hahaha.
I didn't buy the expansion.
Hello Aristiguest
me neither
no aombies
*zombies
yeah, agreed
I thought the story was amazing as it was
haha
Yeah.
Seems just like an SR move to me.
MONIES!
Lol.
and all it took to make her more interested was pointing out that Marston's a family man
LOL
Oh yeah, another thing I like is all the mini games in RDR.
oh yeah me too
Poker is fun.
Poker I suck at
always have
that's it
Haha, you pro liar.
dunno why, card games just never really work with my brain
I have to go over the rules and sets every time I play
I think I only play Texas hold 'em poker.
oh, you know what's sad
:P
LOL
XD
I don't remember how hard I found that.
Maybe I did too. :P
Lol.
and they would just eat all my grain
Oh.
and I would fail
That makes sense.
yeah, I didn't realize they could only get in one way
five finger filet?
Yeah.
power went out here
I was decent at it
Hmm
I honestly can't think of any right now
oh, yeah, probably
same here most likely
Legendary animals were cool.
I mean
even non gameply
graphics, voice-acting, AI
Though they were sometimes annoying to try and get to show up.
all amazing
oh, yeah they were
not enough of them either, I felt
talking to him on XBL, not here
Oh right.
that was back when my ethernet port still worked
It bounced up and down madly, then there was a cutscene and the sheriff commented on it.
Woah, no way
yeah
I remember that clearly.
Rockstar is definitely one to make fun of their own mistakes
they make fun of anything
speaking of which, did you ever go in the theatres?
I went in one of them.
The one about the snake oil seller.
yeah, I went in that one and another that made fun of both feminists and anti-feminists of the time
Lol.
it was from the satirical perspective of the anti-feminists
I forget how it went though
I think that was it though
there was too much else to do to spend my time in a theatre
Oh I found it.
*than spend
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2r8S4uke34
the wagon thing?
Watch.
WTF
XDDD
A cutscene.
O___o
not there quite yet
Haha.
LOL
we noticed it when my friend and I were playing
Unicorn.
When it is used?
LOL
when dying
I know right
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdENXifMyYM
yeah
never got it though
Yeah.
You just wait till it's about to hit you.
Then stab and it dies in one hit.
yeah
oh
it took two hits for me
is it the timing of it?
Well if you time it right you get a 1-hit-ko.
nice
From the wiki.
woah
that's cool
I think I've done it once or twice.
I have to try it
http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100531130849/reddeadredemption/images/d/d5/Rdr_achieve_bearlylegal.jpg
It'd probably look like something epic like that.
One of the extras.
I always use the one you get the first time you turn in a criminal
because trenchcoats/dusters are win
and the one for doing all the challenges once it's unlocked
You had to pre-order to get it.
dang it
there was another pre order one I wanted
And you got the "Deadly Assassin" and "Savvy Merchant" ones too.
OH.
They only released one?
of the outfits?
Yeah.
You can't get the others.
oh, huh
weird
It was decided by a vote on a site.
I didn't want to kill the buffalos.
Since they don't come back.
but then
Oh.
There's a Jackalope wut?
in the undead nightmares expansion yeah
one of the reasons I did want it
The war horse looked cool.
Pre-order only again though.
aww
I actually didn't know about how the bufflo can go extinct
If you had it.
Yeah.
I didn't want to disturb them
Wow.
hi
we made a Pony channel too
#bronies
omg ahhaa
hey
hi again
Hey.
RDX doesn't like us talking about ponies
REALLY doesn't like it apparently.
I forget how do I auto login to a second channel when I connect to the server
right click on the server
on the left
select "Edit Server..."
and go to autojoin channels
oh I just clicked add to autojoin when I right clicked on #bronies
same thing?
yeah that should do it too
oh hey
/hop #bronies
dari, hop
:P
haha
not you for some reason
Oh well.
she said she was gonna do it for us all
oh cool I was wondering why my name was different
oh, nice
.,...ehh
I agree actually
honestly anything with chan I just don't even wanna be part of
If you've lurked ponychan you'd see they're actually mostly really nice.
I just feel like I couldn't if I tried
Porn and hardcore gore images aren't allowed on it.
OOH I GOT A RESHIRAM CARD
still
eh
Woah, nice
Hm.
was it one of those packs where there's a guaranteed card?
or was it random?
I bought the one with a sparkly snivy card on the front
O__o Seems a bit overpowered.
Nice!
Dari: that is way overpowered
Unless it's too the head.
AWESOME!
and I was a dollar off
lol
WANT!
WANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNT!
XDDD
D:
like
I'm gonna stop in and talk to them tomorrow
if I get up early enough that is :P
I was looking at resources from the owl pages on owl folklore and mythology
Meh, it's 7:32 am now, I have to get ready for school. XD
some are like 150 bucks each
No sleep for me. :(
D:
dari how are you alive
you like NEVER sleep
:P
:P
woah, seriously?
150?!
yeah
dollars?
yes
you feel less weary
do they have GOG books even?
yeah they have all the GoG books you can places holds on
and you can choose hardback or paperback
but I assume you already have those
I don't own all of them, just some
there's barely any owl books that aren't picture books I can order though, either
I was only able to order 3
that weren't children's picture books
throughout the entire sno isle branch in my state
IT IS TOO COOL!
oh wow
MUST HAVE UNICORN!
XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWXekpev02Q

Too much awesome.
LOL

6DO IT
6at least for the sake of having it
6we could totally try network play sometime
13I think last summer I attempted to play against Craiglol, but for some reason it wouldn't connect us at all
6you guys need to use hamachi
13Oh, do I need to find Hisoutensoku with an English patch or can I just find it on its own?

12well I can tell it's a Kite ;>
I know dis because I watched a walle-E extra
03mine's an old one that only does 4 but...
I dunno, the zoom on it wasn't great.
03Wall-QE was 2.35 though.
03-Q
yees
DRF: I'm not great with cameras. :P
BRB
they were trying to simulate the look of anamorphic panavision camera.
03so Jurassic Park is natively stratched?
duno
03I just don't get how that works
look at lights. if they go from circle to oval, when it defocuses, it's anamorphic.
03hm
03I mean, I get how anamorphic works if it's already filmed and is PROCESSED that way
03but if hte camera has a lens of 2.35:1, how would you make that 1.85 without making everything look stretched in processing
03hence open mattinmg
03-m
oh, mb it's anamorphic 1.85>4:3 ?
or whatever
03I thought you just said panavision was 2.35
Seeyas Arti
panavision could make other AR cameras
iduno
03if it's normally 4:3, I get filming it as such and cropping it
03but eh

It's on Vista, therefore is horrible.
No it isn't
03Vista paint is the same as XP.

03it just lets you undo more than one thing at a time
Which is a improvement XD
03and I use it as it's x64
lawls
No thanks :<
:P
Meh, I keep 7
Just because XD
I just kept XP. Nice and simple.
(I can just use paint from my previous XP install on the same drive )
:P

03well, I overwrote it as I would never need to use that POS 7 Paint
6I'm totally BSing this exam...lol
04Windows 7 paint still sucks.
(I still hate XP for having a horrible zoom, or zoom out that is)
03Vista's Paint is probably the only good thing about Vista :P

I didn't see any 3D when I watched it 3D in the cinema.
13I've never watched a movie in 3D before
6I liked avatar because of the graphics, and the creatures
6it wasn't the godsend of movies though
Since they FILMED it in 3D
6rio was actually somewhat decent in 3D, but i don't care for 3D really
12I haven't even watched Avatar
06I really don't like 3d tbh ugh
13I've seen half of Avatar LOL
Looked a bit too silly lol
3D as is now seems pretty poor.

You tried to unregister the channel?!
Filter doesn't seem to work any more.
gasp
It doesn't unregister it. :P
unregister meaning make channy go away?
:O
That doesn't unregister the channel.
meaning it's not registered anymore
Do it.
We'll se.
..
...
see*
12lies
I wrote the tutorials for epic-chat
I thought channels need someone (ChanServ in nobodie's presence) to be around for them to exist
not really
*nobody's
And never corrected that
It's just the guard.
but I've made channels before
I've set it off before, didn't unregister the channel.
and left and come back

Hah, I'm right. :P
#BLARG!
How can you even tell?
I just checked.
Left after removing chanserv.
No, but how did you check?
Then when we both leave it'll still be here.
Well, the topic.
OK, leave
/part #blarg!
He rejoins when the first person comes back in.
Then leaves.
the topic should still be there you say?
Yep.
02Kosoveon~
Chanserv does?
Ray~
I tried it with #pokemanz
and Chanserv came back somehow
how goes?
huh
that's really weird
This is weird
Then leaves immediately.
She*
How do you get rid of a channel then?
how do you ever unregister one?
Check the commands list. :P
/cs help
12!pokemon
02Fine~
02you?
This channel is now about PONIES <- Nice
pretty good~
ChanServ protects the channel I suppose.
Comes back in to establish channel topic, and properties probably.
Then leaves.

Maybe that's it, then. Whatever, I'm regretting even bringing it up.

Mine's just an annoyance
4Back when I was young and retarded, I used to read fanfiction
then she realized I'm 20 years old
my family's good now too
O.o
wow
4Till I eventually verbally smacke dher
wow
4Mostly becuase I got the music back in a nanosecond
4And I read fanfiction without anyone noticing
4Cuz I was amazing
4Dad never really cared...
But it was my parents they would have just blocked everything with the word "fanfiction" or anything relating to the fandom I was reading fanfics for
Why'd you have to feed him to snakes?
4Yeah
Boris said it.
4But I knew my way around it
I would use proxies
No, he doesn't even think that.
/me arrests Boris
I'm not defending him!
but not too often because they'd find out about those too
I'm just saying there wasn't any malice toward you or her.
4Yeah. I had severe depression issues back then
03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
Well, you can think that then, Boris. I'm done with this conversation.
Same here, actually
4Like I would sit alone in my room, lights off, reading fanfiction with emo music playing
4I never spoke to anyon
And my brother
4that was too mainstream
4I mean
4purposely
/me goes back in time and gives emo-Rurik huge glasses
ouch, good thing you didn't
4To make it seem like I was Harry Potter
4I was retarded
o.o wait, really?
4Yeah
*be
4It would lol
imagine how people would react
haha
4haha yeah
he didn't even have a nose!
Freak!
me neither
lol
4But I was always depressed until this past year
I cut off his nose after he did it.
but I'm glad I'm out of it
4Then I was like
Mine's chronic, but it remisses at intervals.
4aaand made this: http://rurikredwolf.deviantart.com/art/The-Giant-Squid-208076748
4 600 words
4but 600 words of amazingness
Damn, I'm just about the only person here who's never had any problems with anything.
For me, honestly
It was probably when I stopped talking to SR
hah
4HAHAHA
everything's his fault, lol
I'm talking to him right now
Dari: Well, quiet desparation is the English way, right?
4Red
hi
4Tell him everytrhing is his fault
Although when I was younger I cut myself because I thought it was cool.
sure if you want
:P
/FAIL
4Gas prices included
psst
that's HIS fault?!
/me punches SR in the nose
There we go lol
XD
4Neon
Good thing I grew up.
4It's not as bad as reading Inuyasha fanfics
4I can tell ya that now
haha
I can only imagine
[21:53] <+prince-dari> Good thing I grew up. <- I'm really sorry dari, but that made me laugh a bit
:P
You'd be surprised. :P
...LOL
4Like
yeah I do
:P
Dari, are you 14 or 15?
you just have an inner child
as do I
15.
4I think I reached puberty at that moment
LOL
HAHAHAHA
4:D
If you haven't already
buying it?
SR is clearly depressed because he doesn't have the Matter Destroyer app.
XDDDD
LOL
XD
I'm trying to format how to ask him about it
4hahahaha
Oh yeah, guys
Take that, Newton.

Haaaah, that was brilliant.

4I enjoyed that there message
Anyway, I saw her there, commenting on one of the things. I only noticed that comment afterward, and she responded to something I said, but didn't have any idea it was me.
4Send it
thanks :P
we are not
4Yet
I by myself am a closet gay couple.

Yes. I'm just waiting for his response. He's already angry with me for disagreeing with him in the philosophy thread.
yeah he has no plans to develop the forum any further
nor does he want to
no financial opportunity in it
Was he at least open to letting someone else do it?
BO needs to make his move before I get him in check.
I didn't even attempt it.
same
She just likes to type.
yeah
Wild Barowl fled!
hmn..
/me sighs.
he did say that if anyone can come up with a good design that he likes he might consider changing it
heh
"I don't desing, I do the back end stuff"
*design
well yeah, but have you seen the pages he's made?
but as for the mod settings and him not being around the answer is "you guys can more then handle it"
wow
Yeah, we can totally handle activating people's accounts and adding people to groups, which we don't even have the rights to do
He could at least take those features off if he's not going to be around to manage them
I say you convert the forum into a brothel.
It's already on its way.
XD
Baaaaad idea :P
we already have myspace for that
I'll see if I can convince him to alter permissions
:P
12nom
I don't even need to read it.
now let's see if he does it
"groups"
Yeah
I doubt it'll happen
yep
oh hey
but yeah as for anything else it has no financial gain and as of such it is of no relative importance to him
he did something
I just got added to the fanfiction usergroup
Woah, I just got demoted to a group called "Possible Forum Members."
haha
He's still not sure if you're from his forum?
Oh, I have no idea. I was just kidding.
yeah he says we can add users to groups now
:P
Yeah, but he never really responded.
LOL
That would be every member
Oh, and probably LoneKnight
Owlpages still hasn't wirtten back.
inb4 Stormknight
lol I forgot all about him
My memory is foggy, but wasn't there also someone literally named Spyro?
Yeah
He was the first mod
lol
oh yeah
That's like
All he ever talked about
my first ever post on SF was correcting him
for saying "anyways"
Yo!
hi
Hey
Hey, hey, hey.
It's Faaaaaat Albert.
but yeah he still wont give the fucking thing up to somebody else
He clearly doesn't care about it
@pony
12Lambda is 15Tw6i4st
Makes no sense
that's the only reason he needs
Well
what's up?
I have to disagree with him on that one
it's quite simple
if it doesn't involve money then it doesn't interest him
why he keeps it then
I don't know
too prideful to give it away prolly
ooh, darts
I'm in!
/me scampers off.
D:
Seriously
I'd ask him myself how much he'd sell it for
oh yeah
Oooh, let me do it. He doesn't even know me, apparently.
he also says "Don't be afraid to come talk to me"
as usual
Or you
about all of us
oh
dude
unless it involves money
And you're Canadian.
and for forum growth
his answer is
Make sure to involve that he's Canadian.
yeah, and since we don't have the buckets of money he needs to be interested
"forums grow by members inviting more people."
But that's not the only way
this is a forum based upon a franchise
it runs more on just popularity then friends inviting each other
Speaking of forums
I've always wanted my own forum
or whatever little popularity is left in Spyro
this could be the official channel or whatever
/me throws a dart at RDX by accident.
ouch
idk
That could be the forum you and I have been meaning to start for over a year now :D
you'll never get a straight answer out of him
but it's quite simply just his pride
he wont ever give up something that HE owns or created
Le seriously.
Hahaha
lol
Peels here!
oh well
/me solves more problems
it's like
I'm proud of myself I got him to change ONE thing
I know one thing.
I'm grabbin' peeels.
and every time
I come out thinking "Why do I even care?"
*SR
Senior
For Sr, maybe
For SR, no
who's Sr?
:P
You're missing the point. >.<
/me listens to the crowd OOOOOOOOH
Now you've driven me to use stupid faces.

I don't blame him for that
nga plz
i dont need U
I'm sick of pretty much everyone on there
yeah
"Why do I care?"
But with respectable members like Clock-la it's worth staying for.
Hardly. xD
How about this
Screw SF
And we'll start another forum somewhere else
There's our userbase
:D
:D
can I be part?
NO
Eh, not a viable option. Migrations never go well.

Not a Spyro forum though
