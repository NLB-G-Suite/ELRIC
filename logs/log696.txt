And GW2 can't?
I don't personally like WoW but I'm not about to say no one should play it even if they enjoy it. :P
I've played a lot of MMOs... Oddly enough WoW is not among them.
Only if you make them like that lel.
Oh lord no, not unless the developers are good.
05enough techno shit
Would have to be good to satisfy todays industry
japan would eat it up
lvl 90?
Is that the lvl cap?
Yes
EverQuest's level cap is 95. .....Good luck getting there though. :P
Alot of money doesn't mean it would be a success.
:<
the previous lvl cap was 85
11,02:<
Touche~
11,02O.O
/me goes to work. :p
behold my numbers, they are larger then yours!!!
Yeah :>
I always liked the sound of MMO, but never found one that suited me
:3
I'm cheap
Currently the MMOs I play are Star Trek Online and Star Wars: The Old Republic
I often dislike NPC's in MMo's, but having a 100% player controller world is not hteb est idea either, since not everyone likes to rp
05dayum is it beautiful
bye AdanTheDuck :)
Which?
o.O
I wanted to get into Star Wars: The Old Republic but when I went to try the free trial wouldnt even install.
RPG yes, MMO no
you can have 100% player controlled environments
without a prewritten story or events, or even quests
most MMOs are RPG based
where quests are made by players against other players or ..well animals count as npc
05Vivix: cough planetside 2
lolmost
Maybe, PS2 looked like fun when you guys played it
PS2 still fun, especially Digimon World 1
Wait Planetside 2 Derp
*le facepalm*
lol
Hehe
I think my dream mmorgp is many other's nightmare-
no npcs or prewritten stories- no money system other than actual money items, no quest system- or trade system- loot is first get first have-
Hohohoho
Well, it's like a LARPA, all the story and quests are bascially just "stuff that happens"
yes
factions are created naturally- wars naturally-
money can change currency between factions on their prefered items- creating an economy like EVE
that would be a complete cluster fuck
However from a quest you wouldnt get rewards from the player quest giver as no items are traded
he throws it at you
or, says "tricked you"
yeah-
11,02SAAAVE MEEE
IT's..not a good idea
11,02Woah, let that one slip out.
but I still want it-
yeah, that's the problem
Very boring very quickly
Yeah~~
the EVE gameplay does kind of suck
at least the last time I played it
Hehehe
Maybe~~
yeah, well you don't fight zombies in DayZ anymore
you fight other players
Yeah, I can't just "wander around aimlessly and do whatever". I need quests to keep me occupied. =/
There are still Zombies that can kill you however
True~
Kinda like how- people form clicks, right? Based on woh they like, where they are,
The DayZ idea but - zombies is a good idea
Yeah, but without programming support
people would naturally band together to survive in the wastes
the brotherhood of steel would form
Like I said. A lot of hate.
/me imagines a Pony faction in said setting :D
Hehe
It iis
The Pony Faction. Pure. Win.
Not my thing. T^T
05jsut give me coop
^
There's gonna be an Elder Scrolls mmo
I enjoyed Skyrim however I agree.
Yeah and I can see that failing.
I stick by the Dayz idea
Only natively for BoS
DayZ - zombies with Natural disasters and larger playerbase
Maybe it's because I don't like PvP and I don't interact much (if at all) with other players, but that idea really doesn't seem appealing to me.
Yeah, I don't think it would be something everyone would enjoy
But it's eh, the thing that often bugged me in MMO's, is how quests were global. If I completed a quest, it wasn't completed
some mmo's apparently have global quests that if one complete it is copmelted for ever- but yeah
I've never heard of quests like that
I don't know the real names-
but one quest is for all players, and every player can complete it at any time
even if a nother player has already completed it
talk
Yyeah
Aah
...
I've never actually done progression quests because... I've only known that to exist in Everquest
Mm, I think they're pretty common, or maybe progression quests are a bit more specific
I've played several MMOs and I've only seen them in Everquest
but yeah- I think I'd enjoy MMO with people, social and pretty worlds, but that crazy mmo idea has been in my head for ages
Mm then progression is more specific-
05world boss time~
I mean eh, quests, once you complete them they are not complete for everyone
World bosses <3
...the one I always talk about, but the changes go back and forth
Not the players' ability to complete quests
Oh! yes, I mistook progression quests for level progression
Hm?
if a character dies
Ugh, I hate games like that. T^T
^
Might be, yeah-
Aah
yeah
and just..surviving
no battle
Maybe end it with a bombing-
.-.
wut
Yeah just throw a bomb in there for fun
Nono not that eh
A rpg
Oh right
Reminds me of a beautiful song
Although I can't link because there's a stream :/
but more interactive with several endings
Aah
05won the tier gloves
05go me!
gratz
Time for minestrone, bbl :)
they has all the gearz of course and are the 1337
Yeah, I think it could be fun, interesting
lol
05tough bastard
wish i could help ya
Yeaa
interactive novellas? Never heard of 'em. O_o
like CYOAs
Ooh!
Those things
That'd be pretty cool, actually
turn to page 33 not to die
yeah- hehe I'd play it
Me too
I'm a dork for things like that
Hehe, me too, I've been addicted to eh Choice of games lately
yeah, it could--open up for a lot of really cool story based games
maybe not 10 hours of gameplay, but- still
Kinda like those point and click adventure games, but more linear.
Yeah
Less complicated
._.
.-.
Yeaah
Like I'm gonna believe you were looking for a pinkie pie vector.
Liar kiwi.
LIAR.
no

nou
gais dnt fite D:
Yeah, depending on how interactive you want it- and- yeah
Nein du
Racist.

Me too~~ I'll throw money at devs
hah ur gay
you would.

Too Bad i lost my world of warcraft account
I got banned from WoW, and I never even owned it.
^ lolwut
Only reason I have a Blizzard account is because I have StarCraft 2
.-.
05dunno why
05but i really like this song
I thought it was from MSPaint adventures
/me shrugs
^
That sucks. :<
:P
Unless you're American, then it's mmddyy
yyes
:P
/me shify eyes
>_>
are*
You were right the first time
is
One is
I'm trying to nail is are, they sometimes escape me
/me does a little jig
dates are terrifying
that and deadlines
- /appointments
My brain goes "Date first asdofehwfiupahfelwhfud-- Does not compute!"
My feeble American brain D:
especially if you're not sure where that person is from, and its something like 02/09/12
yee
See, that's why we put month first, cuz that's how we say it out loud.
February 9th = 02/09
Makes sense
I guess that's why they're different-
I think most people say it that way
The 2nd of Septamber = 02/09
September*
Hm, on a world basis yeah, maybe- I think Japan has same as USA?
I have no idea
I used to know that one, from buying tons of cd's from japan
heh
now I can't remember-
Hiiiiii~~~phaaaseeee
.-.
Yeaah~
/me plays ded
:<
Um...
Yeaahh- maybe the dogs can get him
Hehe
I've only had it in vietnamese and thaifood
I'd assume so-
No, story tiime
^
Do tell
Well, it was a documentary at school
Of the Arctic
/me gathers with everyone to hear AdamTheDuck's story
Was pretty boring actually, until the food chain part
Bottom feeder
D=...I think I know that documentary
Because it couldn't hunt, it ended up scavenging seal flesh from other hunted seal
Well not really cannibal
but still ate flesh
Carniduck

Last day of college we sat around watching nature documentaries in the basement
Oh that image
You kill Hello Kitty! D:
POor kitty
heh
Birds are fun
And sometimes, cute
Hey all, can you recommend me a band/some music to listen to?
Tbh I think birds are my least fav kind of animals :/
If I had to pick a least favorite kind of animal, it'd be bugs. :<
I don't hate all bugs, but a lot of them are just bleh, and I'd rather not ahve any in my house
I'm scared of bugs, most of them, but some- like moth Saturn posted last ngiht, was pretty adorable
i think tarantulas are cute
Totally- spiders freak me out the most
aw
They do good, but I can't look at them
Spiders bite. I don't like biting bugs
spiders bite as a last resort
Spiders are welcome OUTSIDE my house
they aren't out there to kill you
They bite me in my sleep
They can eat bugs outside my house
a loooot
i mean we are like giants to them, it's not a battle they want to fight dude
they aren't dangerous
I think of the great species, I like Avian, Cervine, Equine and Feline the best
and whatever foxes are..Vulpine?
they're dangerous if you try to make them bite you
Bugs I mean
Vulpines are cuuute
I like Corvines. :3
Corvines are shmart
i like canines :D
and lions
lions are awesome
Corvines? *googles
Dogs are awesome too
Oh a type of fish?
cats are fine but you don't really put time into training them and teaching them
I have both cats and dogs, but I must say I prefer cats-
And neglected dogs can be hard to handle, cats tend to handle themselves when you're too busy
Exactly
I especially like Ravens
Yeah, dogs can feel..rejected I suppose? If they're neglected, and can then try to become alpha--it can be a weird
yeaah, crows are beautiful-
you get a cat for that
Exactly, but I don't neglect my cats
I sometimes ignore them, but neglected they are not
Ahh, pigeons and such can be a bit creepy- especialyl how forceful they are
Especially ravens
Crows are crazy smart- like that traffic trick
And magpies are self aware :$
Blue Jays are crows too, but I don't hear very much about their intelligence. :P
I think it's a type of raven- or croow-
well time for sleep
Regular Show is fun , actually
nite everypony
eh..sattelite
I consider them the same thing. :P
Ahh
watchcartoonsonline.com has it
I think Netflix and such too, not sure
It's an outside service that's beyond the boundries of broadcast television.
Broadcast is digitalized here
Here too
Not here
Broadcast is free.
/me misses that
08,01hi all
I think some of it is technically free, but you have to buy a riksTV package, and thats subscription and license fee
I haven't seen a magpie in my neighborhood from sime time.
Yeah, its--odd

I'm American and I couldn't care less
http://www.damnlol.com/i/ea4634c6bb35104f42ef7bed2de39785.jpg
I watched part of it
I shoulda seen all of both
All I hear when I watch those things is "blahblahbullshitblah" And they the other side comes on and it's "blahbullshitblahbah".
I'm not interested at all- sorry
Doesn't affect me as a non us dude thing
well, the truth is that a lot of it's hot air, but it's still really vital to pay attention to, and can even be slightly fun.
I like debates, but not political debates
or election debates rather
*wine*
*whine* o.o;
poitical debates aren't just yakblah ;;
and where's my nutmeg?? >.>
It's all the same yakblah
They say exactly the same thing using different words to appease their audience.
/)_(\....
They say whatever they have to to get the vote of whoever they're speaking to, whether they actually mean it or not.
This is week, right?

Is anyone here good in knowing the details of a hard drive?
kissu kissu
http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7339/harddrivechart.png
This
oh. D:
also,i can never drive the quad in fps I suck at it :p
oh ok
/me googles
I figured id ask because I know some of you know a lot about computers :P
reallocated sectors is a hard drive trying to repair itself
marking a sector as "bad" because it cannot be read, and redirecting it to a good sector.
too many reallocated sectors means you have a bad disk.
Is there a way to predict how much time the hard drive has?
nop
or am I dreaming? :P
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a132bdef131d13b9a1ae0bff805f8f71.jpg best airplane :D
it could
lol
reallocated sectors are kind of normal.
05hehe
if it keeps going up, failure is probably close.
Heya again :)
:P
05such an ego booster a beard is
O.o?
05even if its jsut scruff :P
Argh stupid planetside 2
The drive isn't making a "clicking" noise is it?
I know that feeling :p Thought i cant even call my thing on my chin scruff
Heffalumps and Woosels?
oh that song...
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c7bd31428f8945b123d3082a911551f9.png MANLYPIE

dat feel when you download RIFT and play it for 20 hours straight forgetting to go to the bathroom and e3ating
no seriously
in fact, I'm doing that right now
i bought rift and that actually happened
oh, that sucks. =/
dang grinding
but it didnt feel like it
RIFT was a great MMO
they*
lol
I didn't even have to tell them about it
interesting
now if you exuse me
i have to go to the bathroom and watch the Rebuilds
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure how that worked out
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO CLUBBING TONIGHT
the accident was completely my fault
i give no fuck
I'm not complaining though :P
failed the second time
I took a driving course but it didn't effect my rates or anything
but I got extra credit for school.
oh... ok xD
2000 Honda Accord, I'm uploading the picture now
;D
I hate clubbing, Discos are always full of Jerks and bad music + I'm terrible (according to SaturnxD)
http://imgur.com/qp1xs
i think he means clubbing
honda keeps on running.
how much?
$3995
with taxes and title transfer fees it ended up costing about $4300
kind of a bitch.
Was the previous owner the first owner?
can you guys give me some pointers on a work in progress :)?
Yeah
Nice
http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/Dishonored-OC-WIP-1-332872903?ga_submit=10%3A1350496578
well that's a mean opinion
clubs are fun
>a mean opinion
u srs?
yeah and a wrong one too
pls go
I paid $400 for my '99 rav4 lol
This is something entirely subjective
You can't just say "it's wrong. ;'("
/me stands back, dont want to get engaged in that.
head gasket blown
Did you fix it yourself?
cost like $1k to get it fixed
:/
Thats still a good deal
it really depends on how you perceive nice
mechanic
Are you sure you're even old enough to go clubbing, just I wouldn't have guessed you're 18.
everything you know is wrong
clubbing is overrated
maybe for you
But I dont like dealing with used cars
especially ones like 13 years old like the rav4
and it becomes a moneypit, and unreliable.
i mean if you don't like clubbing that's cool but don't blame everyone else for it :P
Anyone going to the Anime Evolution con?
brb
I wish >.>
05there we go
05eugh
ps2 crashed on me just now.
=(
!
05game froze
05then all froze
05then i rebooted
05lol no
05amd <3
Amd?
05phenom 2
05x6
Whats it clocked at?
how far are you in debt?
I am tyring to justify buying a i7 over cheaper amd
=P
Probably won't do it
05standard clock at 3.84
05i have it running at 4.5
05you mean 6 corse :P
05cores*
Assuming I take the full loan amount they allow for next semester
wellp… could be worse.
Most games run off of 2, and I am pretty sure it is that way with PS2
hah
do you have a job lined up?
No :(
05reason comp crashed was that the streaming app capped memory
Cuase most people only have 2
05or slowed down enough to warrant me to reboot
I got lots of scholarships
Wait.... tabitha is going to be at Anime Evolution??
Hrrrmmm.
And I've worked in the food service all four years
Fuuuuuu!!!!!!!!
most people apparently aren't willing to do that even if they're going to have to pay back thousands of dollars of debt =/
yeah they had some money saved
That. totally. Sucks.
but I have two siblings and they're both going to college too
I had a bit of a scary experience yesterday in which my comp just froze up completely.
PS2 does not have a multicore option
Yeah, he's a sophomore
Which if not at all then that would be real dumb
My sister is still only a freshman in high school
Huh, didn't even know you had a sister
Which is another reason why, kiddies, always go AMD.
I didn't used to get along with her at all :P
well, AMD has some mayjor Problems atm
05Barbetos: hmm
lol
05lemme check
Lawl, I think you might have actually compared her to Hail at some point
hahaha
Or maybe I'm imagining things
I see. I have AMD. It's a cheapo Laptop
05AMD thenom II X6 1100T
05its close to... 1 or 2 years old by now
Cuase that clock you ahve, yeah.
she would've been about the same age I think... maybe a little older
It hurts.
yeah, once you don't live with them anymore
05comp never goes above 55 degrees either
same with my parents
O.o
Or air?
05air
It must be that Swedish air
haha
05most likely
Nice cool and crisp
05i got a decent GPU aswell
05TGX580
My sister became a lot less annoying though
she grew up.
I have a ATI 6970
Estimated of course.
Beastly card
Just, my proc sucks
the fucking HT is stuck at like 200
05all my hardware is aprox worth 2000$ at this time
And if I take it up any it does not stay stable
05countign screens, joysticsk darw pads adn everything inside the case
I cringed at that price
Same here for mine
it's weird, she's going to be learning to drive soon
05only quirk i have with it is the OS :p
and she's taller than me -.-
Cause ps2 is bringing my proc to its knees.
how'd that happen
"I stopped being mean to her", that made me lol.
well I was a bitch to her :P
yeah my little brother is about my height
but only because she annoyed me
it was an endless cycle
05right now my focus is to upgrade to 16gb memory and anotehr 580 to bridge with the existing one
I feel the same way
Need more instentive to daul os.
welll...
05yeh
That ruins its chances
is there a stream?
I play real games
Sorry
Oh.
05casue all publishers fear win8
is it bad that I dislike reading fanfiction of any kind
Sorry. Nah I know. Indie games are awesome <3
I feel pretty bad for it now
Lol no, definitely not
I just can't stand it
most fanfiction is terrible
Follow the crowd right?
Some of it is good but I just don't have time for it
Ikr :'( poor Twilight
back to ps2
It's the link he posted, Barbetos/

/me rocks outy
I was kicked
Can i see?
05Lil_B: i worry about compability
but i dont find it entertaining at all.
PM'd
DDR4 RAM? Is it going to be as cheap as DDR3 RAM?
I seem to recall you saying you don't like reading
05but yeah with the additional ram and graph card
05then i can consider upgrading again
What's the good thing about DDR4 RAM?
I can't read fiction.
But i read all day on my computer :P
that's something I can't do
05it hasnt to do with being rich
reading on a computer screen
Wait
05it has to do about prioritizing and long term planning
I turn the brightness right down and can read for hours
/me headkeyboards.
for some reason I just zone out when I'm trying to read long blocks of text on a screen
:$
I'm done!!
lol
tldr ?
Pretty much
I could have summed up everything I just said by just writing tl;dr
kind of ironic
05so yeah
Want to bomb for it?
Bombing is loads of fun
OK this is terrible

in that case they are like $50

Nice, the NC has basically taken the map :).
According to her mach cone it is.
k
The formula would be sin(X) = V(sound)/V(Rainbow Dash)
And since the andle is about 12 and the speed of sound (on earth) is 340 m/s, it works out to that.

we got it looked at and didn't find anything wrong with it
the first thing to go is going to be the break pads, but that's not going to be for a while
I probabaly should have mone checked too soon

lolwhat random screw http://i53.tinypic.com/b8krp.jpg
And the pressure can't be that much different or all the ponies would die of anoxia.
is there a stream?
for some reason he has a randm screw hot glued in there that does absolutly nothing
Yep.
he calls it the "ground screw"
lol..
I like that we are discussing about a Mach Cone that has the Ability, that has the ability to forse RD back to 0 Speed, hold her there for a comedix pause, and than even give here a acceleration towards the other direction
fuckin' irresistible lemme tell you
which is an automotive term I suppose for "ground"
because it must be an automotive part

Idk.
Also, magic wings, made of moring dew.

why do both bases have teleporters to each other that they know about
I want to buy deponia 1 and 2 next month, watched a trailer once and deemed (?) it interesting)
dat equestria girls
twas sort of fun
yup, and I still have some homework left, I think I'll do it at school
stupid honework :/
13mmmmk
yeah and for monday I have to do 40 Equations and Inequalities :/ I think I'll pick some like this: 2x + 1 =
I was just complaining about the same thing 20 minutes ago

/me 13has streamed l4d..
Homework :(
.....i missed it :(
*get to :P
oh well everything changed when I had to go bacck to school x(
somehow I have to squeeze two more pages out of this three page paper
bonjour
it would be good if there were less homeworks, I would have time to work
I figure if I add quotes it could add about half a page
on my c++ projects
mweh.
yeah
hello everypony :)
Bread by bread :D
:)
just have to survive until May
then I'll never have to write another paper
:D
:)
hows things everyone
you'll have to write resumes and start sending em out lol
Pretty goof. How about you? :)
*anymore
i always have to mentally note how conflicting my name is
Well I already have a resume written out lol
c8
I'm gonna go make some sandwiches
I forgot my goggles
Ive always wanted to write a resume that was just full of lies
Oh wait... this looks familiar...
Borderlands 2?
just have some crazy claims on it
yep
Yep.
haha I wanna do that too
they would just not call you
:D
maybe, but you'd still probably never hear from them
or you could just screw around at a job interview
I also want to get a bunch of movie prop money
I'm extremely cynical about the job market at the moment
walk into a mall with a backpack that accidentally unzips and spills stacks of $100 bills all over
75% of my applications get nothing
thats common.
The ones where I get interviews I never get called back
do you press them afterwords?
call in a week later and ask how its going
I used to, but I've heard that that usually just annoys them
because everyone does it now
Hi everypony :)
One time I got called in for a second interview at this place and had 3 different people talk to me
Thought I was getting the job for sure
hey, thelonepony;)
And they were like "Oh sorry, we meant to call you, but we don't have any openings right now"
it's like, yeah, thanks for getting my hopes up and wasting my time
11,01MaxTheBrony: Good.

Nah Not My Style. I Prefer Bigger Swords
Hmmm...
Since I was a dumb teenager and didn't know anything about colleges, I picked it because they gave me the most scholarships

Why?
Tuition costs over $30000 per year and they basically gave me half that in scholarships

If we got rid of guns, then we'd be fucked. There are still other ways to kill people.
???
or a keys
or anything period
13remember kids, when you outlaw guns, only outlaws have guns

lol
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
Religion=/=guns. >_>
Promise? >.>
05as for gun regulation
>_>
Yeah, but if you got rid of guns, people going crazy and gunning down a whole school full of people is less likely.
If self-defense was dangerous, I'd of killed someone by now.
guns = good for children when their older
13prince-dari: if you give everyone a gun and train them in its use, it's also less likely
:3 Assault weapons still legal in Texas - I <3 Texas!
13the moron that wants to shoot up the school is countered by a school ready to shoot back
^
Fuck it their good for children and grown ups
05though if i were stupid enough to move to the US
actauly you don't need to have a license for long guns such as rifles and shotguns
the issue is keeping the gun locked away then
05id def get hold of a a proper sniper rifle
I like Archie Bunker's method for airport security. You give everyone a gun on the plane to use as they see fit then they return them when they get off the flight.
It is ok if you have locked away guns and licenses.
Since when did BState become a debating website?
its their fault killing them selfs
If you did come to the U.S. Wrek...well :3
13and wimpy twits that think it'll be safe if no one has an equivalent defense against guns
05teeehee
I don't like Bullshit very much. they are VERY biased
guns = happiness
EXACTLY.
Oh, i see
I have a gun, but I haven't killed anyone.

I still need to buy a gun
I agree with gun REGULATION. Not banning guns. (expect from public areas that is :P)

Yeah, because bad guys really are afraid of someone else packing a gun.
05as a sidearm
13i just want a mechanus cannon
I have to go through a process to get a CCW permit, yet I can carry a gun in plain sight w/o a permit.

00,03Obama? More like... Brobama!

its about whether you think people are responsible enough to own guns. Apparently you don't

that might actually work
.....did they hate on religion? *slightly displeased Christan* :<
womsn dont kill people
The only one with sense.
*woman
people dont kill people ,pinkies kill people
They're statists when it comes to the government enforcing their ideals on other people usually
this is why some men are stupid
13cuddly_kittehs: only in as far as people using it for their benefit, misleading people
05guns dont kill people, people kill people. and monkeys do to (if they have a gun)
00,03The horror, The HORROR :O
I could kill you 10 ways with a fork and they arn't outlawed >_> <_<
i stay to my opinion. they are biased
irresponsible kill people and themselves. The solution is only giving guns to responsible people
thank you

05Laurayne: says on the front page

whats this?
That's a beautiful sight
hi
I'm just here to help
i spelled it wrong
I want a airsoft AK-47
i think all kids should learn how to handle guns
Twilight: wat?
kids hardly have any responsbility. Guns teach responsibility to people. Make them shoot and clean them.
00,03Airsoft guns... hurt >_<
night guys
whats the difference, if people Own guns
saying that gun-free zone and shootings are related is pretty fucking stupid
Twilight Dat logic
Djpon3:what
11,01I'm slightly Romney because he understands how to run a capitalist economy. I just hate his attitude.
00,03even*
guns are still stupid and pointless to own i dont get why people "need" them
at the end of the day, guns are equilizers.
it's that gun free zones are usually areas with many, many people
no-gun zone or not, if people are allowed to buy a gun, they can bring it anywhere
13Dark_Horst: which means more targets
DJPON3:Thats right
05oh look hes from IRA
05or was that NRA?
NRA
11,01cuddly_kittehs: You mean the electoral college?
he was a former member of a gang
owo
13you are guaranteed to cause more damage
^
DJPON3:wat?
.-. wat
BRB
...Oh dang
wat?
ouch
"no gun zone" is pointless unless its enforced well. whats important is that people arent allowed to buy it
D:
why am i suddenly lagging?
13twilight_sprinkle: but the point is criminals. don't. care.
11,01Hi Twilight.
Well that's the government's fault for deciding that there should be 'gun free zones' when guns are legal
ello
lali-ho Twilight
yeah, weapon regulation is a bit odd
horses
13you're only putting the innocent people at a disadvantage
^
you can't let everyone have guns, but at the same time you can't stop everyone from having them
*ello
Back. Extreme paranoid self made me turn on all of my lights and check the house
this is about responsibility. Stop making the people doing the right thing not able to defend themselves.
13(and yeah having just seen the war on drugs ep, this isn't much different)
:3
Accidental Deaths...
i wish pony episodes would come on but they wont :<

Again :P
/me pouts

i hurt myself
The 2nd protects the 1st.
how are you going to defend yourself from a gang of thugs if you don't have a gun? They don't even need the gun if you're unarmed
they'll just beat you up
The only reason criminals would have such easy access to guns is because of America's attitude towards guns
i agree, that most laws against laws are usless. the thing that would work, is destroying all guns. but again, THAT is a multiple billion dollar industry
"Faith in america"
criminals do not -need- guns if their victims are unarmed
13Eli: then criminals just start importing
05hahaha
Guns are illegal in the UK, you don't see people gunning down everyone here, because law abiding citizens don't have guns.
stop thinking about the lowest denomination. Citizens need guns to defend themselves from both criminals and the government

that bitch be crazy
13personally i think the lie detector output has no correlation with whether you're lying or not
...very trusting
aaaaww, lookit how sad he looks
13BUT, it's a good way to intimidate you out of lying
<--- "Ask" < "Lie Detector"
00,03Wait... guys can be pregnant? .... :3c
11,01Because of the serum.
Polygraph tells whether you're stressed or not, is my take on it
If someone is polygraphing you before you've married, bitch be crazy, get out of there
*does
13yeah but generally if you're being subjected to a lie detector, of COURSE you're stressed
it presumes you're a.not a sociopath. b.not nervous if someone asks if you're a murderer
getting interrogated stresses you out
11,01But I never touched fertility serum.
nothing else

Hallo?

hm...
Only beaten by Finnish and Norwegian
that reminds me
05Vordox: do we even have polygraphs?
W-wat are we watching ponies?
...wow.
the cops pressure and intimidate witnesses and suspects ALL the time
never talk to a cop
ever
and that's how people with lie detectors manipulate the results into whatever the fuck they want them to be
their job is to arrest someone. if you talk to a cop you are wrong
don't answer their questions, ask for a lawyer

err ok
polygraphs
:D
aka Bullshit
again, cops are assholes. Don't talk to them
not all of them are
its in their interest to arrest people they suspect are guilty, its not for them to figure out if you are or not
cops have quotas. They need to arrest people to keep their job. Lawyers are for figuring guilt out
05atleast in the US
cops dont care
05most errors over here are cause of incompetence

thanks
back in my country cops were as dangerous as criminals, that i know, idk whaqt its like in usa
watch an episode of cops, really look at how the cops do things
yes, there are croooked cops, but they are not the majority in any way.
:o
not really
oh boy

Oh, is Bullshit on?
Yes
it is
Yep
He Doesnt Care. He Got Paid
*principal
05thats not the point of the show
Not every arrest leads to a conviction. Any very often people have veyr poor notions of how the law works, their rights and have little access to proper defenses
05the point is to get you to think
I have something to say
too*
05of course they are biased
05they even admit to beign biased
Comparing Penn and Tellar to say... Bill Nye, is akin to comparing Trixie to Twilight :)

Dat Teller
00,03I sell gun-ane and gun-ane accessories

how quickly would penn and teller be discredited if they were proven hacks? I doubt this isn't accurate
did i just get kicked?
if you suspect they're lieing, look it up
If you arrest people, crime stops. It's magical. :D
MAAAAAAAAAAAGIC
yes, be Harsh onm crime, BUT WHEN YOU ARE HARSH ON CRIME, Than watch out that it hits the right people!

11,01When did this air?
hey everypony :)
hey
13Nittany_Discord: 2010 i believe
bye
they use prisoners are virtual slave labor now. Naturally there is no conflict of interest in such a system whatsoever. -sarcasmoff-
yes... I think my point states... Be hard onn crime, but be very very sure that it goes against the right people
there really isn't much more to saY ABOUT THIS
13some are
13not all
05...but whyyyy
because cost savings
13Wrek: means less out of taxes
because people are dumb and don't pay attention
and don't care
how is everypony?
Teller would buy that for a dollar.
05which encourage malpractice
11,01How would they make money?
13actually... i think i'd have to look into this
and now they are talking about forensics...ill brb
the cops have a total conflict of interest, the states prosecution system has a conflict of interest, the prisons have conflict of interest. There is no way to win in the criminal justice system
05but gov funded
05yeh
I still think we should build a wall around the english coast and put everything above a certain crime level there
05ratehr have the gov drive it directly
he looks pissed off xD
yea soyy i messed
sorry
He's always pissed off
11,01Wrek: Totally agreed.
Superjail is how jail should be

that sucks, did he get any money for that?
Hi guys :)
13hm
others just happened to see it
They pop up because complicated reasons.
cops want you to go to jail, that should scare you.
Why would you help them?
Society. Economy. Politics. Probably a bunch of other factors.
HELLO!
owo
lol wut

Mmmmmmm
because boobies
um...wha?
Boobprints! :D
Wow i'm surprised no outcry about nakedness
yes. they should start doing that
I think everyone in my family has a strong hate for cops.
Me Gusta
BOOBS
13that won't work because a) men, b) men have hair there
I totally want to become a crooked cop in the future
The prison probably absorbs some of the cost via prisoner labor. In theory, anyway.
because it helps lines peoples pockets if its not government run.
its corruption
Can I Be An Official Government Boobie Examiner? ;w;
Prosecutors are the most evil form of Lawyer
13sonicdude558`: penn's mind? i'd fund it

That's fucking crazy. ._.
no conflict of interest at all -sarcasm-
Oh boy, copyright law.
13the penalty for copyright infringement is higher than murder
11,01Copyright law is horrible.
thats justice for you
I boycott viacom
Copyright trolls
Shhhhh
:o
lolwhat
We've had this discussion a bazillion times before.
11,01It's abused all of the time, and the punishments are draconian at best.
cops forced 3 teenagers, one of them -mentally retarded- to testify against themselves.
11,01And there's no due process in a copyright violation claim.
Let's just back away slowly from the copyright law and move onto something a little less flame-prone.
Like, I dunno
Abortion
:o
...
11,01Which helps make it easily abused for censorship.
...
13yyyyyyeahno

Don't forget the 3 teenagers thrown in prison for nothing
something: This is a show called Bullshit.
Prosecutors are evil

The interpretation of the serpent as "the devil" is a relatively modern thing.

Anyone Want A Biscut?
Whos streaming?
:/
Prosecutors are horrible people
lol
It's not like we're having a religious argument here.
the cops interrogated a mentally retarded teenager for hours. magically enough, he confessed and implicated his 2 friends. Decades later they finally got to leave prison
Do eet

Nice work lady.
if consent isnt given or cant be given its rape
wasnt there a study on this
I have!
2 studies
but they couldnt find a large enough sample size that hadnt watched porn
And this is why all degrees are not created equal.

TerribleFact: in Conneticut, there is now legal precedent that women are in "a constant state of consent" unless otherwise stated, and thus it legally isn't rape unless the woman says no.
come back when its DVDA
that escalated quickly
they arent even listening to her
NO
Child porn = normal porn = rape?
._.
NOOOOOOOOOOPE
