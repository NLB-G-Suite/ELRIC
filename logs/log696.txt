Like, I go to concerts for music, then leave when they're done
being drunk is an amazing lubricant for making new friends

Gold_Demona: :O
Malavolent ok, still, I want to give you at least one complete finished sprite :)
MadSurge: With a pok?mon Center and a gym and everything.
Gold_Demona, but I miss starting in a small town with only two buildings :$

Lil_B: Sure, just dont overdo it :D
05enjoy some "im still prepping" music"
Gold_Demona: and there's a close patch of grass for catching mons, right? :D
AdamTheDuck: Yeah, it's nice, but having it start in a town actually worth noting is actually refreshing.
Gold_Demona: What edition of pokemon is that?
Malavolent: Black and White 2
Gold_Demona: Oh, I'm playing fire red atm.
NINJA SPY
Malavolent: The ORIGINAL originals or FireRed/LeafGreen?

Gold_Demona: Why? Anything interesting in there?
bye Moopy
Moopy: go to bread
Bye Moopy
I remember when there where only 150 of you. Well technically 151 if you are counting Mew.
Malavolent: It takes everything that was awesome about the original Gold and Silver and improves on it. And adds neat bells and whistles
Malavolent: Having your pok?mon following you around is an added bonus. :3
/me loves HeartGold and SoulSilver
Gold_Demona: Sounds pretty cool, is it still for gba?
Hey everyone :)
Malavolent: fifth gen is really good though. The story is actually interesting in that one.
hello RainbowPie :)
They need to release pokemon blue/red on the 3DS. No changes. No improved graphics. zJust the original game I LOVE!
Malavolent: Nope. It's for DS. It was released after Diamond Pearl and Platinum.
Hello RainbowPie~
hey BoroBrony dont think ive seen you here before, Nice to meet you :)
/me licks AdamTheDuck
ha beat you to it AdamTheDuck
Malavolent: Still, you can play it on PC, can't you?

I mean Gold_Demona -.-
Preemptive licks are best licks :$
i am not new been here about 4 weeks now i think lol
DEEERRRR
hahaha
Malavolent: If you can somehow find a working DS emulator, then sure.
Malavolent: I've yet to find one that isn't glitchy as hell.
There not that hard to get Gold_Demona?
I use to have one
Gold_Demona: 3DS shouldn't be so hard to emulate.
/me gives Jmo a lick as well :P
Malavolent I would give you my DS. But I'm from australi so it probably won't work where you are.
Ewww
RainbowPie: I keep finding glitchy ones that have compatibility issues. T^T
Licking, how gaay.
/me licks Jmo
time to make a sasage egg and bacon sandwich and then good to the gym and get rid of it and extra then a run home lol :)
Malavolent: I said DS, not 3DS
Jmo Well yes I am very jolly this evening sir.
TheRandomkid321: Well then, off to Australia I go. :D
You didn't even lick and I didn't even speak to you.
Hmm, is JmoxJmo OTP considered gay or masturbation?
Gold_Demona DeSmuME worked well enough in my opinion
Gold_Demona: Oops, same thing though.
Gold_Demona: http://www.ndsemulator.com/ try this site,
get the NO$GBA its the best one
or DeSmuMe
Ooh
I'll have to pass this along to my PC so I can download it there. XD
hehe it works well for me
I promised to myself I'll watch all the pokemon episodes.
just have to get use to the keys
NO$GBA never really worked that good for me, + I like that you can switch the screens in DeSmuME so they are next to each other instead of ontop
Malavolent: I tried that once, Theres so many episodes!
Malavolent: What? Why? The show stopped being good ages ago. D:
Gold_Demona: pokemon never gets old!
Hi Everypony
RainbowPie: How many of them are there currenty?
hey Rommulus :)
hi Rommulus
Malavolent Apparently it would work. But my ds is in HORRID condition anyway. But at least it's still in one... oh wait no last weekend... 2 peices... no wait this after noon I threw it onto the pavement... uhh... roughly 70 8- peices :$
RainbowPie: I'm just tired of Ash
Hello Rommulus
Hiyo Rommulus
How are you RainbowPie, Lil_B, AdamTheDuck and Gold_Demona?
Malavolent: season 1+2 i think is 119 episodes
hello Rommulus
Good Rommulus
TheRandomkid321: You fool, what were you doing? D:
good Rommulus how are you
How are you aswell BoroBrony
I am good thanks RainbowPie ^.^
RainbowPie: 1 season is 1 league, correct?
Gold_Demona: Yeah true but the nostalgia is just so good haha
Malavolent: I believe so
i am good Rommulus hows you
AdamTheDuck: Commerse?
I thjink Pokemon lost me after the first Season, I mean every episode was the Same, 1) meet someone 2) Team Rocket 3) TEam Rocket defeated. And every season was the same too, Ash looses the finale
RainbowPie: I watch old episodes for nostalgia. The newer episodes just disappoint me. =/
I am good BoroBrony =)
Gold_Demona: I haven't seen any of the news ones yet
Rommulus, commerce, like accounting and business management
Malavolent making a hit Youtube video... Forgot to switch off the lens guard though... But you know us teenage males. Me and my mate always getting into shennagins. The pluses of living in houses that have lots literally touching.
RainbowPie: They're.... let's just say a shell of its former self.
Gold_Demona: I like the pokemon movie (the one where it shows the creaters of mutwo) Thats my favorite!
mutwo
dat MewTwo
mewtwo*
lol sorry :3
TheRandomkid321: Oh you :D
AdamTheDuck: Ooooh I see, I guess those types of things can get a little tiring, try find a way to excite yourself again or a way to chill well I guess thats why you are here actually :)
There are several movies, so it's good thing you said Mewtwo, or I wouldn't know which one you're talking about. XD
Gold_Demona: haha yeah thats why i mentioned that pokemon :D
And by several I mean like ten.
JUST GET A FUCKING IPOD TOUCH OR IPHONE! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19971231

So anyone here watch the walking dead?
I for one love it!
heels yeah RainbowPie
oops meant hell lol
haha
Not I. Not into horror
Gold_Demona: honestly its not that much horror
walking dead is so good :)
Its more action
RainbowPie, I'm reading it actually~
Is it any good?
AdamTheDuck, reading it? I didn't know there was a book
zombies isn't horror?
O_o
RainbowPie, it's a graphic novel
Malavolent: Its a really good show
Nah its more action than horror
i cant wait for season 3
Comic book pretty much
AdamTheDuck, Ah thats cool
BoroBrony, season 3 is already out from what my friend says
Alright I'll rephrase. Not into zombies unless I'm shooting them with plants.
BoroBrony, Season 3 Episode 1 has been released
not in england
That awkward moment when you have no friends.
05+5 if you know this next one
Ahh ok
Adam pls.
Gold_Demona, hahah :3
Or gravity guns
not for me in england lol
Jaymoo pls
Huamn beings are monsters. I hope I don't live to see the first encountrer with extra terrestrial beings for we would surely mistreat the. I just saw a bunch of people in mexico trying to get a rare fish close to shore just to exploit it because it was 6 metres ong.

BoroBrony: Just... How?

AdamTheDuck: Noes, RPing is srs bsns.
CrimsonPhoenix: the fourth panel has been adapted into a smilie on Ponygoons :D
BoroBrony: How come an egg attacked you?
i am frying one for my mate and as it went into the pan it spat at me ouch
The last revenge.
Had that happen. Not fun
all i could here is my mate laughing at me
It's especially bad when I'm making something with oil
MadSurge, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7924/
I had pastries try to assault me, but they got eaten :D
CrimsonPhoenix: D: why u so mean
i used to cook at a resturante but now i am a GCO lol big change but i still cook for me and my mates and my girlfriend since she cant cook lol
My father in-law likes to assault me with chocolate bars.
And then I eat them
I don't see the issue there.
^
BoroBrony: Please explain GCO to poeple like me.
GCO?
MadSurge, because I got swad http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4589/
swag**
swad
Well, he said he is a GCO now.

general construction officer Malavolent when a new development goes up like houses or summit my team and i are the frist in we take down tress then put new ones in we flatten the ground and put in pipes and lines then we move on and let them biuld the houses so i get to mess around with JCBs and stuff lol
That was bad and you should feel bad.
MadSurge, oh Jesus wat :D
Dat abomination tag
BoroBrony: Oh yeah, I get it. How did you get from being a cook to being a GCO? And what is JCB? :D
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1231/
AdamTheDuck: it's a horrible plushie, but it's fun to look at :D
ok let's get serious now
MadSurge: It's... terrifying. o_o
/me puts on his kitty top hat
That's worthy of Dolan and Gooby
Gold_Demona: makes for a great example of knockoffs though :D
TWLIGHT SPARKLE COMMANDS YOU TO READ
lol
Hai everypony
wrek, you should play GW2, its fun
Hello DerpyMuffins
Hi DerpyMuffins
well Malavolent i was bored of being a cook and went to do and apprenticeship then got a job as a GCO and a JCB is diggers and excavators and stuff like that lol and on the side of most of them it says JCB the company that supplies them lol
Gold_Demona: "What retarded changeling morphed into this thing?" :D
MadSurge: LOL I don't know. XD
05DeadpoolDash: nope
also Malavolent i love to get dirty lol :D
DeadpoolDash do you talk about any other game.
TF2
EXTREME READING
GW2 dis GW2 dat.
MW4MERCS
BoroBrony: Yeah, I didn't need to know that :X
DCUO
Uh-huh
Books
MWO
BOOKS
no not like that Malavolent mud and stuff lol
FO1,2,3,New Vegas
Skyrim
also i am english from the UK :)
BoroBrony: You really enjoy that? :D
ME1,2,3
I can keep going
Must be a rare occurrence.
BoroBrony: Oh, let me rephrase my sentence then.
Oh you British chaps and your fantastic sounding names.
Jmo: What's wrong with talking about GW2? :P
Who said villains can't be cute as fuck http://i.imgur.com/5o5Q8.jpg
everytime I see WoW, I die a little inside
Nothing, it's just that is all I've seen him talk about really.
CrimsonPhoenix: So kawaii.
yeah i love it we go in all clean and come out like a bag of shit but thats how we know we did good
05DeadpoolDash: why? cant you jstu let others have fun?
BoroBrony: Or... you know... you can get dirty as pig but still do nothing. :D
I have seen people destroy their lives with the game
And GW2 can't?
DeadpoolDash: Well it's not really the game's fault.
Don't try playing that card bro.
See, that's the person's fault, not the game
Here comes another internet arguement... :<
Bronystate general http://i.imgur.com/Doxoy.gif
I don't personally like WoW but I'm not about to say no one should play it even if they enjoy it. :P
Not everyone gets addicted to WoW and if it gives someone enjoyment from playing it then let them play. If they are smart then they know when to stop.
Malavolent yeah that works but after sometime it stinks and that sucks lol you should have seen me yesterday had to jump in a pit and shovel some stuff out i went in clean came out as a pile of dirt lol :)
lololol
That flying mount is cool
BoroBrony: World needs more people who like to get dirty for sake of others :D
I've played a lot of MMOs... Oddly enough WoW is not among them.
but MMO debates go nowhere fast and just turn into rage and butthurt, so not going to talk about it anymore
yep me and my team are so good but mostly we know that someone is going to get a new house are somepeople we get a job when we finish there office its a good feeling :)
Only if you make them like that lel.
I'd love to see a Pok?mon mmo
Like I said, I think people should play what they enjoy. If people struggle to manage their time, that's their fault. :p
Oh lord no, not unless the developers are good.
05enough techno shit
that would be the ultimate grindfest a Pokemon MMO, GOTTA CATCH'EM ALL!!!
Jmo: I mean like an actual real official one. Like actually endorsed by Nintendo
Your mount sways to the beat
also Malavolent that last one made me blush no one has eversaid that to me or anyone from my team :)
Would have to be good to satisfy todays industry
japan would eat it up
Pok?mon's a huge cash cow. An MMO would be a huge success.
lvl 90?
Is that the lvl cap?
Yes
EverQuest's level cap is 95. .....Good luck getting there though. :P
Alot of money doesn't mean it would be a success.
the new expansion raised it I think
:<
The new expansion made the lvl cap 90
Jmo: I mean a business success.
the previous lvl cap was 85
11,02:<
Touche~
/me drags NewSuperBronyU into the chat
11,02O.O
/me goes to work. :p
Jmo: Whether it would actually be good would depend on how they make it.
behold my numbers, they are larger then yours!!!
11,02Have fun CriticKitten :3
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU
Yeah :>
I always liked the sound of MMO, but never found one that suited me
Cause you're picky Vivix.
/me huggles Starflash back :3
:3
I'm cheap
Currently the MMOs I play are Star Trek Online and Star Wars: The Old Republic
I often dislike NPC's in MMo's, but having a 100% player controller world is not hteb est idea either, since not everyone likes to rp
well i think it is time to get dirty and then come home and watch the england v poland match bye everypony :) :)
Bye BoroBrony
05for such an old game
05dayum is it beautiful
bye AdanTheDuck :)
I think, if I started to play mmo's, I would have fun if it were with the right people. That's probably the most important
Which?
Wrek: You think THIS is old? You should look at EverQuest some time
o.O
I wanted to get into Star Wars: The Old Republic but when I went to try the free trial wouldnt even install.
NPC's will always be a part of any RPG, MMO or not
RPG yes, MMO no
you can have 100% player controlled environments
without a prewritten story or events, or even quests
most MMOs are RPG based
05Vivix: cough planetside 2
lolmost
Maybe, PS2 looked like fun when you guys played it
in a 100% pc controller mmorpg setting you don't need a quest handler either, the player just needs a notebook
/me never gets to play PS2 with everyone else on BronyState because of timezones ;~;
would need a new computer for PS2
PS2 still fun, especially Digimon World 1
Wait Planetside 2 Derp
*le facepalm*
lol
Hehe
I think my dream mmorgp is many other's nightmare-
How so Vivix?
What exactly do you want in an mmo, Vivix?
no npcs or prewritten stories- no money system other than actual money items, no quest system- or trade system- loot is first get first have-
Vivix: ......What? How the hell would that even work?
I think it SOUNDS like fun in my head, but might be a nightmare
Hohohoho
Well, it's like a LARPA, all the story and quests are bascially just "stuff that happens"
so a giant free for all
yes
factions are created naturally- wars naturally-
money can change currency between factions on their prefered items- creating an economy like EVE
that would be a complete cluster fuck
However from a quest you wouldnt get rewards from the player quest giver as no items are traded
So... A big white empty vast land of nothingness...
he throws it at you
or, says "tricked you"
EVE is the closest you will probably get
yeah-
11,02SAAAVE MEEE
well, fancy beautiful fantasy map setting
but story is what the players have done since serer day 0
IT's..not a good idea
11,02Woah, let that one slip out.
but I still want it-
11,02Off to bed, night all ^-^
without a narrative most people will get bored
Niight SB
Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
good night NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU I tried to safe you, but they said that you were in another castle
yeah, that's the problem
Very boring very quickly
Gnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz :)
Yeah~~
night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz :)
but EVE is the closest as it is now, but I'm not that big a fan of space or..yeah that gameplay
/me licks Lil_B
Play the game..... There's nothing to do... Leaves game.
EVE has a prewritten story, but all history is what players have done
the EVE gameplay does kind of suck
well there's things to do, but the things to do are what players want you to do to help them
not a quest marker,
at least the last time I played it
Vivix: What if you're playing by yourself?
Like, if player group A wants to control the server- they might snap up new players to initiate them
You know Vivix, your "dream" MMO sounds like DayZ if it had a bigger server limit :P
Hehehe
Maybe~~
A solo player would get REALLY bored really fast in a setting like that
damn, still have to start working on the Presentation about Mercury and another one about a Project my class did about Genes >.<
Theres no NPCs though so no Zombies
I think so too Gold- I don't think it's possible withou ..you know, a lot of planning and some sacrifice, like adding some story or quest
Griefing would be a huge problem in a game like that
yeah, well you don't fight zombies in DayZ anymore
you fight other players
Yeah, I can't just "wander around aimlessly and do whatever". I need quests to keep me occupied. =/
It would be, but griefing would be part of the game
There are still Zombies that can kill you however
True~
so Fallout Online
Ya true
yeah, I would love a fallou setting with that crazy massive free world roam I described- but- I don't think it would be popular for the reasons you guys said-
Fallout Online with no NPC's
Kinda like how- people form clicks, right? Based on woh they like, where they are,
Factions would be formed- but it would be hard for new players to enter-
The DayZ idea but - zombies is a good idea
but that might create a new faction-
Vivix: Sounds like guilds
fallout has huge backstory that could easily be filled by players without a narrative
Yeah, but without programming support
people would naturally band together to survive in the wastes
I don't really see how that would work, given human nature. I see that only ending in a lot of anarchy and chaos and probably a lot of hate.
It would be, but wouldn't someone form to fight that chaos?
like a group of friends who hate griefers-
the brotherhood of steel would form
I dunno- it would probably fail horribly, but- I think it could work out if you gave the players absolute control, as a social experiment
Like I said. A lot of hate.
/me imagines a Pony faction in said setting :D
Hehe
Giving the players absolute control of the game is asking for complete chaos.
It iis
but that chaos might be interesting-
The Pony Faction. Pure. Win.
05fuck fallout and elder scrolls MMOs
Not my thing. T^T
05jsut give me coop
^
Wrek, hehe, ikr :D
There's gonna be an Elder Scrolls mmo
you would still need enemy AI creatures like Deathclaws and shit to wonder around the wastes or else it wouldnt be Fallout
I enjoyed Skyrim however I agree.
Yeah and I can see that failing.
I stick by the Dayz idea
there are co-op mods for the fallout games
I would love to set up such an mmo as an experiment, but I--yeah- I don't think it would succeed. I'm just a fan fo that maximum freedom you get in some RP settings
DeadpoolDash, nah those mods died
Only natively for BoS
DayZ - zombies with Natural disasters and larger playerbase
Maybe it's because I don't like PvP and I don't interact much (if at all) with other players, but that idea really doesn't seem appealing to me.
Yeah, I don't think it would be something everyone would enjoy
But it's eh, the thing that often bugged me in MMO's, is how quests were global. If I completed a quest, it wasn't completed
some mmo's apparently have global quests that if one complete it is copmelted for ever- but yeah
PvP in an MMO for me is about choice, unless that is what the MMO is based around
global... what?
I've never heard of quests like that
I don't know the real names-
but one quest is for all players, and every player can complete it at any time
even if a nother player has already completed it
The only quests I get are ones I can actually finish and get stuff from.
Hai ^.^
Do you mean like quests such as get get this man 5 wolf meat and when you complete the quest you see 5 other people trying to get the guy 5 wolf meat aswell
well you have event progression and regression in a game no one wants me to take about
talk
Rommulus, yeah, and that kinda irked me when I was a kid and tried MMO's
Vivix: Oh! Those things! I think they're called Progression Quests.
Yyeah
At least that's what they're called on the Progression servers in Everquest
now I think I heard someone talk about--events happening on big MMO's, like--wars--and htat sounded cool
Everquest has special servers for people who like to do them
Aah
...
What was that..first huge MMO? A..a something
I've never actually done progression quests because... I've only known that to exist in Everquest
Mm, I think they're pretty common, or maybe progression quests are a bit more specific
And I only played on the one regular server, so the Progression quests were never a concern for me.
I've played several MMOs and I've only seen them in Everquest
but yeah- I think I'd enjoy MMO with people, social and pretty worlds, but that crazy mmo idea has been in my head for ages
Mm then progression is more specific-
05world boss time~
I mean eh, quests, once you complete them they are not complete for everyone
World bosses <3
well progression/regression events happen on a constant basis in various zones depending on the action of players in the event area in a certain game
mmm, that's what I like, events that change the world forever in games
DeadpoolDash: Yeah, I've only seen that in EverQuest. What other game does that?
All other games I play, the progression happens by server patches and expansions
well it took me a few minutes but i managed to cut a splinter out of my foot, what are you guys up to?
...the one I always talk about, but the changes go back and forth
Not the players' ability to complete quests
Oh! yes, I mistook progression quests for level progression
Actually Vivix, I just realised something my friends were talking about
Might be your style
Hm?
And in Everquest, the progression quests only happen on the one server. All the other servers are up to date based on patches and expansions.
It is yet to be released but it is called Vampire of the Masquerade, it is going to be a MMO set in modern day, the heirachy of vampires is all players, there is a prince of every city.
The player that is the prince can only be overthrown by being killed
if a character dies
it will be perma death
Ugh, I hate games like that. T^T
ewww perma death
I love permadeath for some reason-
^
That might be more your style when it comes out
Might be, yeah-
It's one of the reasons I never made it through Fire Emblem. Incessently restarting my game to make sure NOBODY FREAKING DIES!!!
My friends and I are going to be making a Sabat group ( pritty much Terrorists of the Vampire world) and we are going to try overthrow the Masquerade (the Government) in a city.
Aah
Interesting this is they actually give you benefits for being in the Masquerade (government) instead of the Sabat so the players dont all go terrorists
hm, it sounds kinda fun
yeah
I think my game taste is a bit eccentric- but not all the time
Like, I really wanted a war game that was abot being a woman with child in London
1943 ish
and just..surviving
no battle
Maybe end it with a bombing-
.-.
wut
Yeah just throw a bomb in there for fun
A --story game
Nono not that eh
the london blitz
A rpg
Oh right
Reminds me of a beautiful song
It could be fun- semi-linear game, almost dear esther ish
Although I can't link because there's a stream :/
but more interactive with several endings
Aah
05won the tier gloves
05go me!
gratz
Time for minestrone, bbl :)
Yay!
Hey Wrek, what does one do once they get full tier armour?
Vivix: How would a game like that end tho?
Here you go Vivix http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/62202/Vampire-The-Masquerade-MMO-Details-Emerge
Well, basically, with the london blitz, maybe an outro with whether or not your child survived, and the future based on your choices
Vivix: That might actually be interesting. Your success would be based more on your intellect than your ability to fight.
they has all the gearz of course and are the 1337
Yeah, I think it could be fun, interesting
MASH THE B BUTTON DAMN YOU
lol
05tough bastard
wish i could help ya
Vivix: And you could end up in a variety of scenarios based on where you go and what you do.
Yeaah, almost like..almost like a modern version of interactive novellas-
Vivix: The only real violence would be if you get caught and die. :P
Yeaa
interactive novellas? Never heard of 'em. O_o
like CYOAs
What now?
eh Choose your own adventure
Ooh!
Those things
That'd be pretty cool, actually
turn to page 33 not to die
yeah- hehe I'd play it
Me too
I'm a dork for things like that
Hehe, me too, I've been addicted to eh Choice of games lately
That sort of storytelling can apply to any story though, not just a woman trying to survive the blitz.
yeah, it could--open up for a lot of really cool story based games
maybe not 10 hours of gameplay, but- still
Kinda like those point and click adventure games, but more linear.
Yeah
Less complicated
Ah, I wish I had a indie game studio at my hands
>mfw crystal pony r34 while looking for pinkie pie vector
._.
I think the best way to describe such a game is like a "choose your own adventure movie".
.-.
Welcome to the internet XAX
Yeaah
XAX: wut
Like I'm gonna believe you were looking for a pinkie pie vector.
Liar kiwi.
Cuz that's basically what it is. You make a choice, and then you watch a cut scene. And then you're met with another set of decisions.
Jmo: srs
LIAR.
no
u
nou
gais dnt fite D:
Yeah, depending on how interactive you want it- and- yeah
Nein du
I think the closest we have might actually be Walking dead game, veery CYOA ish
Racist.
Vivix: I'd buy something like that. =)
k
I'm easily amused, so that'd keep me occupied for hours
Me too~~ I'll throw money at devs
wub u long tim kiwi
dat dragon
wub u long time in return jaymo
hah ur gay
you would.
Dat kick
/me slowclaps for Jmo
orly
Jmo stahp :<
Too Bad i lost my world of warcraft account
I got banned from WoW, and I never even owned it.
^ lolwut
AdamTheDuck: Some asshole hacked my Blizzard account and used it to sell money on WoW. :P
Only reason I have a Blizzard account is because I have StarCraft 2
Gold_Demona: Stahp came from a reference to Jersey Shore ಠ_ಠ
.-.
05dunno why
05but i really like this song
XAX: I wouldn't know. I never watched Jersey Shore.
I thought it just sounded silleh, and Jmo is always silleh
I thought it was from MSPaint adventures
/me shrugs
XAX: I just think "stahp" is funny. :P
^
Gold_Demona: I read the know your meme page. Yeah, it is pretty funny, but now I think of jersey shore every time I hear it :<
That sucks. :<
:P
what is up everypon3?
Jersey Shore..ruining things since ddmmyy
yyes
:P
/me shify eyes
>_>
Those two always confuse me, release dates on the internet is terrifying unless one of them is over 12
are*
You were right the first time
is
One is
Oh, but the release dates on the internet is terrifying?
what is up everypon3?
I'm trying to nail is are, they sometimes escape me
Vivix: Oh that. lol XD
Vivix: I thought you were talking about the other is
ah yes hehe
You are correct sir
/me does a little jig
dates are terrifying
that and deadlines
- /appointments
Yeah I get confused when I see a date posted in the rest of the world's date format. :P
My brain goes "Date first asdofehwfiupahfelwhfud-- Does not compute!"
especially if you're not sure where that person is from, and its something like 02/09/12
Yesh. Not sure if February 9th or September 2nd...
yee
See, that's why we put month first, cuz that's how we say it out loud.
February 9th = 02/09
Yeah, but in Norwegian we say Andre September, which is 02 09
Makes sense
I guess that's why they're different-
I think most people say it that way
The 2nd of Septamber = 02/09
September*
Hm, on a world basis yeah, maybe- I think Japan has same as USA?
I have no idea
I used to know that one, from buying tons of cd's from japan
heh
now I can't remember-
chat is full of Gold_Demona and Vivix
Hiiiiii~~~phaaaseeee
ohai Phase4 :D
.-.
Yeah, chat is dead otherwise. XD
Yeaah~
/me plays ded
Just me and Vivix yakkin' away
/me holds the duck
/me licks Vivix
/me prepares duck roast
/me defibrillates AdamTheDuck
:<
/me makes roast duck as a result
Woops
Um...
Yeaahh- maybe the dogs can get him
/me squeezes an orange over the duck
Duck L'orange anypony? :D
orange? Hm Never tried that
I've never had duck, so I have no idea what I'm doing. :P
Hehe
I've only had it in vietnamese and thaifood
I only assume that's how Duck L'orange is made
I'd assume so-
cook the duck in orange juice
Adam! You must know, you are the duck
So he'd know how to cook a duck? lol XD
Ah yeah, cannibalism or..something
Gold_Demona: mmm, I taste delicious!
Did I ever tell why I put my name as a duck?
Nope
AdamTheDuck, nope
No, story tiime
^
Do tell
Well, it was a documentary at school
Of the Arctic
/me gathers with everyone to hear AdamTheDuck's story
Was pretty boring actually, until the food chain part
And there was this one duck
Bottom feeder
D=...I think I know that documentary
Because it couldn't hunt, it ended up scavenging seal flesh from other hunted seal
Cannibal duck is best duck <3
Well not really cannibal
I think I saw that too- or heard of that duck, creepy
but still ate flesh
But... If the duck is eating seal, how is it a cannibal? O_o
Carniduck
^
Ducks are omnivores aren't they?
Last day of college we sat around watching nature documentaries in the basement
That and this is my steam display picture http://fav.me/d1w4b5f
I think so
Gold_Demona: I think so
Oh that image
You kill Hello Kitty! D:
So I felt obliged to use duck in my name :$
POor kitty
heh
Badass scavenger duck is badass
Birds are fun
And sometimes, cute
Hey all, can you recommend me a band/some music to listen to?
Rommulus, what type?
Rock or something loud. Not screamo however.
Rommulus, maybe some post rock/ambiance perhaps?
If I had to pick a least favorite kind of animal, it'd be bugs. :<
what is up everypon3?!
I am in one of those moods that I just want to destroy my eardrumbs.
Ohai dj-pon-3
I don't hate all bugs, but a lot of them are just bleh, and I'd rather not ahve any in my house
hello AdamTheDuck
Rommulus, damn, was about to suggest something relaxing >.>
Gold_Demona: but bugs are all kinds of fun :( they can do all sorts of stuff
Rommulus: Rammstein
I am usually all about Beethoven and Motzart but today not so much
Rommulus listen to eh..2morromorroland
I will be writing the bands down so suggest a bunch if you like
MadSurge: They gross up my house
MadSurge: I want them OUT
Lightning Bolt is eardrum destroyers- I guess, not big fan, but yeah.
i think tarantulas are cute
I like pretty bugs. I mostly don't like the creepy bugs that feed on things in your house.
Grizzly Bear - Caribou - Sparklehorse - Animal Collective - Steel pole bath tub - pavement | all bands I've listened to a lot lately
Cuz that means they move into your house... And you have to kill them...
Totally- spiders freak me out the most
aw
spiders are so nice though
;__;
They do good, but I can't look at them
Spiders bite. I don't like biting bugs
spiders bite as a last resort
Spiders are welcome OUTSIDE my house
they aren't out there to kill you
They bite me in my sleep
They can eat bugs outside my house
a loooot
i mean we are like giants to them, it's not a battle they want to fight dude
Gold_Demona: don't get me wrong, I don't like bugs crawling on me, but they're cute to watch!
ShyBetaFemale: That doesn't make them any less dangerous
they aren't dangerous
I think of the great species, I like Avian, Cervine, Equine and Feline the best
and whatever foxes are..Vulpine?
they're dangerous if you try to make them bite you
Gold_Demona: birds instead are dumb, aggressive and they poo all over the place :(
MadSurge: Yeah, I think so too. But outside. I don't want them in my house
Bugs I mean
Vivix: Yesh Vulpine
Vulpines are cuuute
I like Corvines. :3
Corvines are shmart
i like canines :D
I don't want a bird as pet, but I think they're beautiful
not big on canines- but cute too
and lions
Same here Vivix
lions are awesome
Corvines? *googles
Cats in general are awesome
i'm a dog person
Dogs are awesome too
Oh a type of fish?
cats are fine but you don't really put time into training them and teaching them
I love both cats and dogs equally.
But I don't want to own a dog cuz they're too much work
I have both cats and dogs, but I must say I prefer cats-
And neglected dogs can be hard to handle, cats tend to handle themselves when you're too busy
Exactly
oh Corvine Crow?
Vivix: Yes, Corvines are the crow family
neglected dogs aren't hard to handle unless you're a sloppy owner, the first dog i grew up with was a doberman we got from a shelter in africa
I especially like Ravens
Yeah, dogs can feel..rejected I suppose? If they're neglected, and can then try to become alpha--it can be a weird
Gold_Demona: Dog Whisperer docet :D
yeaah, crows are beautiful-
you don't get a dog if you plan on neglecting it
you get a cat for that
Yeah, so when I move out on my own, I don't plan to have a dog
Exactly, but I don't neglect my cats
I sometimes ignore them, but neglected they are not
cats are fine with neglect they're more territorial than personal anyways
Me neither- they seem happy enough
One of our cat wont let us pet him, but he likes being in the same room as us, and seems most happy when he can sleep knowing we are there
My cats generally hang out wherever I am in the house
Vivix: agreed :3 to be honest I really hate only commonbirds like pigeons and seagulls
Ahh, pigeons and such can be a bit creepy- especialyl how forceful they are
MadSurge: Yeah, those bastards suck
Crows are smart birds:)
Especially ravens
Crows are crazy smart- like that traffic trick
Ravens know how human fishing techniques work!
And what's that bird that creates tools to lure out insects from wood?
And magpies are self aware :$
Vivix: and who uses human traffic to break nuts?
Blue Jays are crows too, but I don't hear very much about their intelligence. :P
I think it's a type of raven- or croow-
They drop them on crosswalks, so they can get them when the lights turn green
Gold_Demona: Mordecai is the exception :D
well time for sleep
Night DeadpoolDash!
MadSurge: Is that the one from Regular Show?
night DeadpoolDash
Goodnight DeadpoolDash
Gold_Demona: yeah :D never watched it though
MadSurge: Me neither
Regular Show is fun , actually
I don't have cable, so I can't watch it
Vivix: heard so
nite everypony
Ah, I don't have cable either, but it goes on parabol here
eh..sattelite
I consider them the same thing. :P
Ahh
watchcartoonsonline.com has it
I think Netflix and such too, not sure
It's an outside service that's beyond the boundries of broadcast television.
ah yeah
Broadcast is digitalized here
Here too
Not here
Broadcast is free.
I miss non digital broadcast, it was all free and..cool
/me misses that
08,01hi all

Too bad, cause they're pretty birds: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Elster_wikipedia2.jpg

My teachers didnt really teach me much besides the basis of it, such as the the colour wheel blending what not. However the main thing they taught me was the appreciation for art.
Our teachers mainly taught us absctract art, but- just learning that and appreciation is a big step
FGSFDS why is stream not wor-oh finally

I usually go into lurking mode when I get into a game, occasionally glancing at the chat. XD
Panda: nope, puzzle game :D
xD
MadSurge: in the shower?
Panda: Maybe he was trying to make tap to work
MadSurge: were you combining water drops?
Maybe you have to solve a puzzle to get the water on
Gold_Demona D: so... you've been watching this whole time? I feel exposed.
lol XD
Barbetos Invite me to squad?
welp
twilight_sprinkle: I thought I was playing Puyo Puyo o///o

Gold_Demona: like some sort of myst/heavy rain combo
/me noms Gold_Demona
JunkerKun!
Ah! DX
/me slaps JunkerKun around a bit with a large trout
MY Gold_Demona!
Panda|Sketching: Ow!
o.o
Panda, you stole Jmo's trout again!
Well, Pikachu's bowel wasn't so yummi X)
Why does everyone say that D:
MadSurge: oh, i didnt know puyo puyo was a puzzly game, i only know of a puyo puyo dj who makes very weird techno remixes lol
dis trout is mine!
Jmo's the one who's always slapping people with large trouts. :P
MadSurge: his name makes a little more sense to me now lol
Soviet Pones
what if... Panda is jaymoo :O
i know this song
:O
i played it a long time ago
Ouch... RA3...
Gold_Demona ive been slapping people before it was cool. Just not in mane chat :3
twilight_sprinkle: it's kinda like a cross between Dr Mario and Puzzle Fighter :D
Panda: heh
Fuck yeah RA2 or RA3
:D
MadSurge: ah k lol
Yeah I did hear that it was an actual command in some client.
hipster panda
like /trout or something
Gold_Demona: trout? O_o
Gold_Demona eeyup. for me its just rightclickname>slap
/me slaps JunkerKun around a bit with a large trout
heh
Gold_Demona: Who would make a command like this?
Panda|Sketching: HEY! Stop it!
JunkerKun ME!
JunkerKun: Whoever thought it was funny to slap people with large trouts. :D
And they're right
JunkerKun D: not till you gimme yo art talent!
Panda|Sketching: O_O
Yeah, my client doesn't give me the slap option if I right-click. :P
Oooookay... just... just don't saw my arms off, okay?
D:
why would I do that?
So if I slap people with trouts, I have to write the whole thing out, and I don't quite have it memorized. XD
Panda|Sketching: Well, I've heard that it is all in hands!
Gold_Demona, repeat after me :3 /me slaps ___________ around a bit with a large trout
Panda|Sketching: Don't like the term "talent" though
Actually, You get better results in your art if you use your whole arm to draw and not just your hand.
Panda|Sketching: In my book it is all about training
JunkerKun oh my~ you have talented hands? ;)
JKJKJK!
JunkerKun: I'm of the opinion it's a combination of talent and skill.
The best artists have both
JunkerKun yeah Gold_Demona yelled at me cuz i got it wrong /)_(\
Gold_Demona: Nah. For me talent itself is a combination of skill and will
I have talent but not a whole lot of skill.
Wait whats this about slapping?
I have LOTS of will power!
does that count?
JunkerKun: Talent is something you just have innately. You develop the skill through training.
/me slaps BladedWings|HW around a bit with a large trout
Panda|Sketching: Sure. I've been training for 6 or 7 years and still don't draw as good as I want
Oh my god there actually is a command for slapping with a large trout
/me takes trout from ASoftFluffyThing
JunkerKun 18 years .___. and i didnt get tolerable till i started drawing ponies.
JunkerKun, you took my right click!
ASoftFluffyThing: Who? Me? O_O
/me looks up from homework " ASoftFluffyThing , what was that for?" :(
ASoftFluffyThing: Wasn't me! <_<
[12:58] * JunkerKun takes trout from ASoftFluffyThing

JunkerKun: may i make a suggesion...run
Everyone press ctrl V then enter!
Panda|Sketching: Well, I wouldn't even start drawing until I got into CDRR stuff
Panda|Sketching, that's not a good idea. You don't know what someone has on their clipboard thingie
Panda|Sketching: cant, i got some youtube link copied atm

It's all right, Ryunosuke. :D
hii
 take it wrek is playing PS2 again? :p
Yep.
err i take it
Turned on the computer this morning to get a notification of a hard drive failure :/
hey
D:
05qat
oh, and could you save some data?
05w*
Im still on the computer
using it right now :P
Stop killing yourself
than do backups!
Everything is backed up
uhh
My old computer used to always have BSoDs
lawl
ok
wrek
what are you doing? :p
everything was always fine after restarting
05i have the shotgun
05so im infiltrating
ooo going the stealth shotgun
05getting nice 1shot kills
i need moneys to get the ar or shots
Is anyone here good in knowing the details of a hard drive?
or anything better than a pistol :p
what do you mean by details?
kissu kissu
nope
http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7339/harddrivechart.png
This
This is what I checked when I was getting the failure message
oh. D:
also,i can never drive the quad in fps I suck at it :p
What does the Reallocated Sector Count supposed to do?
sorry, no idea what that means
oh ok
/me googles
I figured id ask because I know some of you know a lot about computers :P
I pretty much only know the basics of hardware stuff. :(
I will paypal you monies
reallocated sectors is a hard drive trying to repair itself
marking a sector as "bad" because it cannot be read, and redirecting it to a good sector.
too many reallocated sectors means you have a bad disk.
Is there a way to predict how much time the hard drive has?
nop
nope
So it could run for another year....right?
or am I dreaming? :P
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a132bdef131d13b9a1ae0bff805f8f71.jpg best airplane :D
it could
lol
reallocated sectors are kind of normal.
its only a problem if you see that number constantly increasing.
all hard drives have small maufacturing defects
ill keep an eye on it from now on
reboot your pc a few times and check the count
05hehe
if it keeps going up, failure is probably close.
VioletGreySha! :)
hay MadSurge :P
Heya again :)
hai MadSurge
:P
Hi, MaxTheBrony. :)
05stroking mah scruff <3
If you have many reallocated sectors, it is statitstically probable that your drive will fail sooner than one without.
05such an ego booster a beard is
hi MaxTheBrony and VioletGreySha
O.o?
05even if its jsut scruff :P
Ah
Argh stupid planetside 2
The drive isn't making a "clicking" noise is it?
I know that feeling :p Thought i cant even call my thing on my chin scruff
nope it isnt
its pretty quiet, I didnt notice any change
I did restart it too and the number hasnt changed
Heffalumps and Woosels?
oh that song...
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c7bd31428f8945b123d3082a911551f9.png MANLYPIE
your probably fine.
clicking noises on hard drives means impending doom.
MadSurge: .........
Just keep backups, like you should anyways even if your drive is 100% perfect.
Well at least everythings backed up
yeah
This song fits so well with the rest of the playlist. Eeyup! Sure does. XD
^
:P What is this song from?
where*
Whiney puh?
wrek, can i link this vid for its sheer stupidity?
Whinnie the Pooh
ah
:)
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a132bdef131d13b9a1ae0bff805f8f71.jpg
Specifically, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. :P
/me is a Disney nerd
Oooh this song
there is a vid, of duke nukem
Gold_Demona: i love beauty and the beast
reading 50 shades of grey
Heh I love disney but i dont know all the songs in english :D
Chrysalis: hahahahah
Bronysith: Me too. That one's awesome. =)
O.o
I got my car :D
drove it to school today
Chrysalis is it good xD?
Chrysalis: is it hilarious as they say? :D
its absolutely hilarious
Gold_Demona: i love it alot, i need to read the original story
hows it running?
do you like it?
pics?
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0wc5gB231qbe9hqo1_500.jpg
I love it
Bronysith: The original story's quite a bit sadder.
Gold_Demona: arent they usually sadder?
then disney makes it happier
cause you know
DISNEY
Yup
it's got a few dents and scratches and stuff but as far as I can tell nothing else is wrong with it at all
like hunchback of notre dame
:)
lol Yeah
the first owner obviously took really good care of it
or the little mermaid
that is a depressing one
depressing yet beautiful
Insurance was only $60/month
Disney's notorious for taking HUGE artistic license on everything they make. That's why I try not to worry about the original content when I watch them. :P
hehe
not bad
It's more enjoyable that way
Id like to see pics too
but im a sucker for original stories
Like how I try not to think about all the Greek mythology they got wrong in Hercules. :D
I've got one on my phone... one minute
but disney does a great job
That it does
and my god
the villain songs
my god
once you hear hellfire everything else isnt as good though
what kind of coverage do you get for $60 a month?
https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350494776532.png the face of my childhood nightmares
theft? collision? liability amount?
Just bodily injury and property damage
I didn't do collision because it wasn't a very expensive car
without collission mine was like $135 a month
Dat Feel when you buy a new game and play for almost 5 hours streight >.<
shows you what the private market can do to reduce rates
^
^^
dat feel when you download RIFT and play it for 20 hours straight forgetting to go to the bathroom and e3ating
no seriously
you are forced to use one insurance company here, ran by the province of british columbia.
in fact, I'm doing that right now
I also get emergency roadside coverage and renter's insurance basically free so that was nice
i bought rift and that actually happened
oh, that sucks. =/
dang grinding
you had a small accident before didnt you?
did that effect your rates?
but it didnt feel like it
RIFT was a great MMO
Yeah, but I didn't have my license yet so it "didn't count"
Bronysith, you're like those Korean people that die because the plays Starcraft without eating or sleeping.
they*
lol
I didn't even have to tell them about it
interesting
now if you exuse me
Bronysith that reminds me of a cconversation I once read about "according to the class book I wass missing on this day... one might think I would notice wehen you 'forget' a day" other guy "Well, I know what happened, Diablo 3 came out, I skippd school that day too xD"
i have to go to the bathroom and watch the Rebuilds
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure how that worked out
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO CLUBBING TONIGHT
IT'S GONNA BE SO FUN
the accident was completely my fault
i give no fuck
I'm not complaining though :P
excellent ShyBetaFemale
ShyBetaFemale the poor seals :( why club them?
Also helps that they gave me discounts for going through their safe driver thing a few months ago and getting good grades
my brother took his road test again
failed the second time
because Lil_B those seals are actually bottles of beer and they need to be neutralized
ah
I took a driving course but it didn't effect my rates or anything
but I got extra credit for school.
What kind of car did you buy?
oh... ok xD
2000 Honda Accord, I'm uploading the picture now
;D
your disk probably isn't failing.
http://imgur.com/qp1xs
I don't recall disco being popular these days
Just keep an eye on things if you start to notice issues with opening files or programs, or the disk is making strange noises...
i think he means clubbing
honda keeps on running.
yeah, everything that Involves non classical music with dancing is Disco for me
how much?
$3995
That car looks good
with taxes and title transfer fees it ended up costing about $4300
they had a nice discount at that lot that day; I was really lucky
kind of a bitch.
Was the previous owner the first owner?
can you guys give me some pointers on a work in progress :)?
Yeah
Nice
ShyBetaFemale no, he did none of that xD thats all my own opinion
well that's a mean opinion
clubs are fun
>a mean opinion
u srs?
yeah and a wrong one too
pls go
who are you?
I paid $400 for my '99 rav4 lol
I'm sorry, but I'm just speaking of what I personally have expirienced so far myself
You can't just say "it's wrong. ;'("
What was wrong with it?
MaxTheBrony: I like it. :)
/me stands back, dont want to get engaged in that.
AJIsAwesome: Thank you :)
maybe the CLubs at your place are awesome, and you have a really good time there with nice people, but I have none of that
head gasket blown
Did you fix it yourself?
cost like $1k to get it fixed
:/
No im no mehcanic
Thats still a good deal
it really depends on how you perceive nice
mechanic
Are you sure you're even old enough to go clubbing, just I wouldn't have guessed you're 18.
everything you know is wrong
clubbing is overrated
maybe for you
i love it
But I dont like dealing with used cars
especially ones like 13 years old like the rav4
yes, and that's your opinion :)
stuff just starts dying eventually
i meet new people, i party with them, get new friends, have an awesome time
and it becomes a moneypit, and unreliable.
i mean if you don't like clubbing that's cool but don't blame everyone else for it :P
We are a big fan of Ford Escorts
Anyone going to the Anime Evolution con?
The problem with used cars is that you don't know what the previous owner did
brb
I wish >.>
05there we go
05eugh
What happend?
ps2 crashed on me just now.
=(
I was killing so many robuts
!
05game froze
05then all froze
05then i rebooted
I'm a bit Nerdy, I really don't have the dance moves, I'm not that social with and most of the music there is not my Style, I do not blame anyone there, that's just the reason I don't like it, sorry, If it felt like I'm attacking someone
Ah
Wrek do you run a i7?
Lil_B: I know that feeling.
05lol no
05amd <3
Amd?
What is your proc?
05x6
with all the loans I'm going to have from college it's going to be a while before I can buy a brand new car
AJIsAwesome a LAN Party is where we ROCK! (too bad I never had one xD )
Whats it clocked at?
how far are you in debt?
I am tyring to justify buying a i7 over cheaper amd
=P
Probably won't do it
Well, I think Imma head off for the day
See y'all tomorrow Bronystate
it's ok Lil_B i don't hold it personally :D some of the people i'm going with are kinda geeky, and i wanna take this more introverted girl with me to get to know her some
Aight. Bye Gold_Demona
Cya Gold_Demona!
BYe, Gold_Demona. :)
bye Gold_Demona
05standard clock at 3.84
05i have it running at 4.5
bye gold... damnit
so far it's looking like around $25000
Oh no wonder
05no wonder what?
The two cores you have alone kick PS2's ass
Which is what PS2 runs off of
05you mean 6 corse :P
05cores*
ShyBetaFemale sounds awesome, thats the kind of thing that would get me too go to such a place too, but yeah, one day with some Friends
Assuming I take the full loan amount they allow for next semester
wellp… could be worse.
Most games run off of 2, and I am pretty sure it is that way with PS2
hah
do you have a job lined up?
It does not make sense from a dev stand point to make a game use more at the moment
No :(
05reason comp crashed was that the streaming app capped memory
Cuase most people only have 2
I know people who are like, $60k-$120k
05or slowed down enough to warrant me to reboot
05not really a crash
I got lots of scholarships
Wait.... tabitha is going to be at Anime Evolution??
Hrrrmmm.
And I've worked in the food service all four years
Is that core an APU or is the new FX series wrek?
Lil_B it'll be fun :D usually i don't like the music either, but when i'm really drunk i don't care, and i'm optimistic enough as it is so whatever
does PS2 use multiple Cores? I know a lot of modern Games don't even really use 2 cores max no matter how many you have
RaveBrony: Yep.
Fuuuuuu!!!!!!!!
did your parents help you out?
most people apparently aren't willing to do that even if they're going to have to pay back thousands of dollars of debt =/
yeah they had some money saved
That. totally. Sucks.
ShyBetaFemale xD another Point, I don't drink alcohol, I'm a damn big partybomb, trust me xD
but I have two siblings and they're both going to college too
Lil_B Honestly, I do not know for sure
I had a bit of a scary experience yesterday in which my comp just froze up completely.
PS2 does not have a multicore option
Lil_B! :$
your brother is probably in college now is he?
hey MadSurge !
So I assume, it is either on by default, or not on at all
Yeah, he's a sophomore
Which if not at all then that would be real dumb
My sister is still only a freshman in high school
Kandarihu: happened to me when it occasionally overheats
Wrek having two cores running at 4.5 is better than what some i7s can do
I just let the computer stay like that for a while, and it just slowly came back to life. That's the really wierd thing.
Huh, didn't even know you had a sister
Which is another reason why, kiddies, always go AMD.
MadSurge, what CPU are you using? AMD or Intel?
I didn't used to get along with her at all :P
well, AMD has some mayjor Problems atm
Kandarihu: Intel
So if I ever mentioned her it was probably to complain about how annoying she was
05Barbetos: hmm
lol
05lemme check
hahaha
and if they don't fix them within the next year they will be gone
Or maybe I'm imagining things
I see. I have AMD. It's a cheapo Laptop
05AMD thenom II X6 1100T
that woudldn't surprise me if I did that
Kandarihu: this is an OLD laptop
05its close to... 1 or 2 years old by now
Aight. I might see what I can get for that one with a black edition
Cuase that clock you ahve, yeah.
she would've been about the same age I think... maybe a little older
I have a boner right now
It hurts.
you come to like your siblings more as you grow older.
I know some HardCore AMD Fans who are switching to Intel now because the Bulldozer and Piledriver AMD CPUs have big problems
yeah, once you don't live with them anymore
05comp never goes above 55 degrees either
same with my parents
05gotta love proper cooling
Dear god
O.o
Water cooling?
Or air?
05air
It must be that Swedish air
I don't have to put up with crap from my family every day so they don't annoy me anymore
haha
05most likely
Nice cool and crisp
05i got a decent GPU aswell
05TGX580
My sister became a lot less annoying though
They have 8 Cores, yet get outperformend bye the i7 and even the previous AMD Processor, although I'm not technical enough to explain what a "Floating point issue" is
Wrek So, how much did that cost you all together?
she grew up.
I have a ATI 6970
Estimated of course.
Beastly card
and I stopped being mean to her, so that helped :P
Just, my proc sucks
the fucking HT is stuck at like 200
05all my hardware is aprox worth 2000$ at this time
And if I take it up any it does not stay stable
05countign screens, joysticsk darw pads adn everything inside the case
I cringed at that price
Sounds about right
Same here for mine
but that seems like to be a sweet ass computer
Just need a new mobo and proc now
it's weird, she's going to be learning to drive soon
lolol
05only quirk i have with it is the OS :p
and she's taller than me -.-
05ratehr have linux but oh well
Cause ps2 is bringing my proc to its knees.
how'd that happen
"I stopped being mean to her", that made me lol.
well I was a bitch to her :P
yeah... Facebook has had a really awesome Idea... construckt a Serverfarm in Scandiinavia, it will be ekofriendly cooled by air... because it's cold there!
yeah my little brother is about my height
but only because she annoyed me
I once saw a Youtube video that compared how various CPUs handle high load if the heatsink is removed. All of the Intels recovered, and all of the AMDs died.
Dual os wrek?
it was an endless cycle
05right now my focus is to upgrade to 16gb memory and anotehr 580 to bridge with the existing one
05too lazy Barbetos
I feel the same way
Need more instentive to daul os.
Wrek you do 3D Work or other actual Producing Work on your PC?
Considering that Linux supports zero games
welll...
05yeh
That ruins its chances
is there a stream?
Barbetos a lot of Indies + Steam for Linux this Winter
I play real games
Sorry
05the games will come once win8 is launched
ah
Oh.
Barbetos like Soccer?
Steam is coming out for Linux? Really?
05casue all publishers fear win8
is it bad that I dislike reading fanfiction of any kind
Sorry. Nah I know. Indie games are awesome <3
I love soccer
Kandarihu yeah
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6c6b18b13509be02ab340bc9254a756c.png OH DEAR GOD WHAT D8
I feel pretty bad for it now
football is what I call it though
Lol no, definitely not
I just can't stand it
most fanfiction is terrible
I figure there rest of the world calls soccer foot ball, so I figure I will too.
MadSurge: :|
Follow the crowd right?
MadSurge: ..........
Some of it is good but I just don't have time for it
Ikr :'( poor Twilight
/me huggles the whole chat.
I missed it, did MadSurge make a poo in the chat again?
/me hugs GriffonCherry :)
hi GriffonCherry *hugs back*
Wrek I was just asking because 16GB RAM is enough for a serious Gamer, but I would suggest waiting for DDR4 RAM wich should come out next year
back to ps2
Barbetos: I found a scary image D:
hi GriffonCherry
I still have my eyes on you... BladedWings....
It's the link he posted, Barbetos/
howdy Lil_B
*.
/me rocks outy
I was kicked
Heya Lil_B :)
Can i see?
05Lil_B: i worry about compability
GriffonCherry: :O CrazyCherry!?
people always link me to stuff
Good day there Sylandest and MaxTheBrony :)
and they are like, its so good
MadSurge: Link it again?
but i dont find it entertaining at all.
PM'd
Wrek yeah, a new Mainboard will probably be required
BladedWings: Yup. How didn't you see the similarity?
DDR4 RAM? Is it going to be as cheap as DDR3 RAM?
/me huggles Lil_B
I seem to recall you saying you don't like reading
05not on release Kandarihu
05but yeah with the additional ram and graph card
so that could be part of it
/me hugs Sylandest back :3
05this machine will last me 5+ years
05then i can consider upgrading again
What's the good thing about DDR4 RAM?
GriffonCherry: this chat room has tons of similar nicknames...i just assume everyone is different until proven otherwise :$
I can't read fiction.
But i read all day on my computer :P
Wrek: What. You rich bitch. :D
that's something I can't do
05it hasnt to do with being rich
reading on a computer screen
Wait
Wrek: :P
05it has to do about prioritizing and long term planning
GriffonCherry is CrazyCherry? :O
well since I got my new laptop text looks clearer, so its like your looking at paper
I turn the brightness right down and can read for hours
/me headkeyboards.
for some reason I just zone out when I'm trying to read long blocks of text on a screen
:$
Kandarihu faster, here is an example, 4GB of DDR3 Ram is better than 8GB of DDR2 RAM
I'm done!!
BladedWings: Same here. :$
Lil_B thats why you get 8gb of ddr3
So if the article or whatever has really long paragraphs I just don't read it
lol
tldr ?
Pretty much
/me hugs GriffonCherry "it's ok" ^_^
Kandarihu and every Mainboard and OS has a Maximum of GB of RAM that it can work with, so if you can the most out of each one
Chrysalis I'm planning 16GB for my new PC
I could have summed up everything I just said by just writing tl;dr
/me nuzzles BladedWings. "Okies. :3"
kind of ironic
yay
05so yeah
Sorry, GriffonCherry. :D
05more planetside... or anotehr game..
Wrek 500 more Aux and I can get Zepher
Want to bomb for it?
Bombing is loads of fun
OK this is terrible
I'd like to see another game. :)

MadSurge: :D
looks a bit fake though.
wait so Pinkamena Diane is okay, but Twilight Sparkle isn't? :P
yes.
you are correct.
wat
if you say so
damn, flash crash XD
MadSurge I saw a Picture once of Spike as Pony surrounmded by the Main 6 as Dragons :)
Wrek I vote for PS2 cause heck it's god damn fun to farm aux right now
Lil_B: cause he forgot to turn off his swag lol
05probably
05enjoy the music ^_^
05also
05gettign all episodes of bullshit
05so ima gona stream that later
Wrek awesome
Yay. :)

05new meta game notes btw
05Biolab: Reduced respawn timers at connected facilities / outposts
05Amp Station: Overcharged base turrets, longer overload times on facility generators
05Tech Plant: Access to MBTs - yes, facilities will be unable to spawn MBTs without a connected tech plant
Oooh
brb, srs bsns t ttnt
Interesting
...
i dunno...
you can kind of order them online for $15...
seems... legit?
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ebadb0f29d60c49a2cda00e3db162e80.jpg :D :3
Unless your me
in that case they are like $50
because they jack up the shipping to an unholy amount.
MadSurge: WUT :D

thanks Everlasting_Joy
HI, pot80. :)
http://i.imgur.com/gnPvQ.jpg
back
pot80: I see nothing but a pot. Who spoke?
Wrek: Play the Jak and Daxter series chronologically, expect Daxter, since there isn't a good emulator for the PSP/Vita...
/me vigorously shakes AJIsAwesome 's hand
UH~ UH~ UH~ UH~ OFF WITH YOUR HEAD
VenHur: i would acutall like to see that :)
DANCE DANCE TIL YOUR DEAD
hi pot80 and Eli :)
HEADS WILL ROLL, HEADS WILL ROLL, ON THE FLOOR
hi Lil_B
well, thats confusing
GriffonCherry: well I spoke I think
btw alexxm|colt you here?
yeah Lil_B
/me vigorously shakes Lil_B 's hand as well
05suggesting me to play console games of any kind is a bad idea
And I wouldn't want to spoil about Jak 3, but to those that haven't played it, there's a good "WTF" moment.
05also in addition to bullshit
05im thinking of gettign all seasons of dexter
05cause why not
alexxm|colt just wanna thank you for Kung Fu Hustle :3
thanks Lil_B
I love that Movie :)
Holla everypony! :)
pot80: Wut. D:
Wrek: i loved the J&D series. but i only played until the 3d one
Wrek: dexter the series or dexter's lab the cartoon series?
socks are cool
pot80: I think the serial killer.
Ah, this song
Rainbows are cool.
Everlasting_Joy: aw :(
Wrek: the Dexter with Michael C. hall is nice too
pot80: I have S1 of Dexter's Lab.
guten Tag GilDash :)
Lil_B: Umm... holla? :D
GriffonCherry but you asked who was speaking and how you only saw pot and I got confused
Lil_B: you're confusing him...
GilDash it's just good day xD
Lil_B: I know roughly what it means. I was just being silly. :p
Eli ?Que?
GilDash I know :P
It's been so long since I last saw dexters lab :P
pot80: So I saw you! :O
Lil_B: want me to start speaking french or swiss german? cuz that is REAL hell
Lil_B: If I really wanted to be silly I'd go all British and complain about the blitz or something. XD
http://i.imgur.com/gnPvQ.jpg
Eli swiss german... Dat Jänner xD
GriffonCherry: oh... sorry :P
wazzup guys
Lil_B: Jänner?
GilDash Blitz? whats the british definition of Blitz?
Eli sorry, Jänner is Austria >.<
Lil_B: The period during World War 2 where Britain was being bombed? :S
Lil_B: if it's supposed to mean January, well we say that too, but it's slang
yo does anyone know excactly how fast rainbow dash goes during the sonic rainboom. not according to fanfic but actual official fact
GilDash ... I only know about operation Sea Lion, but this operaTION NEVER STARTED .7
Eli I know
take that floor
Lil_B: Never heard of it. XD
^^
Ah, the song has an ending
i know ust im a huge sonic/mlp fan and i really want to find out who is faster sonic or RD
Ah, I see. :)
GilDash well, the operation never started, because... Sowjets and D-Day and Stuff :P
Lil_B: Yay? :S
AJIsAwesome: i've seen one of these vids, i think it's quite famous, but i think it's BS. assuming a pegasus has the same weight as a normal pony with that wingspan... just doesn't add up
Eli: I can understand that. I'm not one to question logic in a cartoon, anyway. :D
Nice, the NC has basically taken the map :).
GilDash I'm ok with History :) *unless someonme is a douce with it, than I can get REALLY uncomfortable)
AJIsAwesome: me neither. if it were all logic, it would be as boring as RL
Lil_B: I know next to nothing about history at all. Honestly, I can't even tell you what happened last week hald the time. XD
GilDash ok, I'm terrible at what's going on int he World right now, but in everything that's before the fall of the Berlin Wall I'm interrested :P
Hello GilDash! :$
Lil_B: Well, to summerise today's issues: We're all going to go bankrupt and it's the end of society. XD
MadSurge: Holla! :)
this has probably been asked and answered but what song is playing?
DCd wtfd
I wouldn't know. My internet is being quite crap today and refuses to load the stream.
Ralin: is that official fact
According to her mach cone it is.
What offical fact? The Sonic Rainboom doesn't exactly have official figures. XD
chat derp :P
k
The formula would be sin(X) = V(sound)/V(Rainbow Dash)
hey all, hope I didnt miss much
And since the andle is about 12 and the speed of sound (on earth) is 340 m/s, it works out to that.
*angle
Ralin: but if the sonic rainboom is just a sonic boom and ranbow at the same time doesnt that just meen she goes the speed of sound when she hits the sonic rainboom which is 750-1000 mph
GOOD MORNING SB!
11,02HAI :D
/me glomps SB and gives him Denny's
/me hugs Panda|Sketching back while nomming on the Denny's
^^
nope
pot80: so she goes 750-1000 miles per hour at max speed
Hi, NewSuperBronyU :3
did you have to do any repairs on the car?
because speed of sound depends on the air and its pressure and stuff
No, actually
Silence.........
chat derp
11,02AJIsAwesome: :3
:3
we got it looked at and didn't find anything wrong with it
the first thing to go is going to be the break pads, but that's not going to be for a while
/me huggles NewSuperBronyU
but if the air pressure is the same doesnt that mean RD's max speed (rainbowdash
I probabaly should have mone checked too soon
mine*
is the same exact speed as sonics average speed
what kind of car do you have?
Ford escort :)
ah
lolwhat random screw http://i53.tinypic.com/b8krp.jpg
what is that?
And the pressure can't be that much different or all the ponies would die of anoxia.
/me huggles dat Lil_B back :D
I know I was just trying to think about how the mach cone would appear before the actual rainboom :P
something a guy was working on
so metal
is there a stream?
for some reason he has a randm screw hot glued in there that does absolutly nothing
Yep.
he calls it the "ground screw"
Maybe she already broke the sound barrier, and the rainboom is some kind of secondary effect once she hits several mach?
lol..
I like that we are discussing about a Mach Cone that has the Ability, that has the ability to forse RD back to 0 Speed, hold her there for a comedix pause, and than even give here a acceleration towards the other direction
aww yeah gonna put on my fancy cologne
apparently the guy at radioshack told him the third terminal had to be conencted to the "ground screw"
fuckin' irresistible lemme tell you
Lil_B: We must, for Science!
which is an automotive term I suppose for "ground"
Even thought I'm not one to question logic in cartoons, it's actually quite interesting to hear you guys talk about these kinds of things. :)
because it must be an automotive part
so he took it litterally and glued a wire to a screw and glued the screw in
Ralin: but there was no sonic boom (of sound) before the rainboom appeared... hell why am i thinking so deeply into this XD
pot80: cause where nerds dude its in our nature
Rainbow dash doesn't make enough noise to cause an appreciable sonic boom?
http://i.imgur.com/65dDF.gif
(its not what you think it is.)
:D
or maby she was so high up in the atmosphere that the sound wasnt as loud and there wasn't as great an effect
dat skype
But she was below Cloudsdale, and that means that there should be more than enough atmosphere to breathe in, so there still should be enough to carry sound well.
hey YO wuts up everypony:)
Hi, scout19_tf2. :)
hmmmm chat must be sleeping eh
whos streaming
?
Wrek.
shud of known he pllays dis game alot
I'm going to take off folks.
ralin but she started off above cloudsdail and above the collusium?
just found out my paper is due tonight at midnight :(
later Everlasting_Joy
and I have other work to do too
00,10well that was a dick move
bye Everlasting_Joy
damn school
BYe, Everlasting_Joy. :)
hi scout19_tf2 and bye Joy
pot80: But not that much higher, and we already know that the difference in air pressure between the surface and cloudsdale is negligable.
http://imgur.com/kt6Ss
though it was high enough for the suns rays to suddenly become powerfull enough to burn raritys wings suggesting a much lower pressure as well as the fact that rarity was struggling to breath up there?
And since pressure scales linearly, then it that means that the difference between cloudsdale and the site of the rainboom should also be negligable.
ASoftFluffyThing: :D
lol ASoftFluffyThing
pot80: I interpreted the trouble breathing as panting from the heat.
AJIsAwesome, BladedWings: Dat paperclip. If I ever saw that, I wouldn't know whether to :D or D:
ASoftFluffyThing: Me too. :D
AJIsAwesome: So many memories of rage that little thing bought us.
and the sudden burning of the wings?
Idk.
ASoftFluffyThing: i always changed it from the paper clip to the robot lol
I always changed it to the wizard. :D
BladedWings, I disabld ALL of them
Also, magic wings, made of moring dew.
ASoftFluffyThing: :D
you should quit.
school that is, not irc.
But either way, it shouldn't matter, because the rainboom occured below cloudsdale.
Hallooooooo everypony :)
helloooooooo Bromany
hi Bromany
how are things Bromany
yes but I was making a sugesstion for the sonic boom that should have occured earlier due to the mach cone but didnt
hey Bromany
fine fine, don't know why but I am in a great mood tonight
ok, thats legitamate.
Hi, Bromany. :)
Hi there AJIsAwesome
Glad to see you're happy. :)
thank you ^^, hope you are in a good mood too
Hello~
Hi, Emmie. :)
Hiya Emmie
hai ^^
hi emmie :)
hey emmie get it :P
cause hey an...
gonmna plöay some more Harveys new eyes, gonna train my brain a bit, some good old Point and Click Adventure Time :)
olo emmie
Yaaaaay Black Swan is on tv :D
lol
I only have one semester left to pay for
Lil_B: so it's a good game?
so not getting a degree might be kind of a waste of money
... oin the other Hand... My Dad just called me, Citizen Kane is on TV
MadSurge I think so, it got humor, the loading times are ok, the Interface is easy, and the Writing and Voice Acting is good
Ooooh, great movie :$
MadSurge It's made in germany though, I don't know how good the english dub is
MadSurge and it is a Sequel to another game, but so far you didn't really needed to know anything major from the first game
I like how it starts, you are a little innocent Girl in a monastery together with other Children and a Grumpy Nun, the first Chapeter ends with you killing basicly all of the other kids by accident
Lil_B: it's humorous then?
and all the gore, dead bodys, or splattered blood is removed by a Gobling whith Pink Paint :P
MadSurge yes
MadSurge like Monkey Island
oh, harveys eyes
awesome game
MadSurge the first game even had a Sticker on the Front "From the Creators of (crossed out), From the Guys who liked Monkey Island"

lol
Lil_B did you already play Whispered World ?

bonjour
Hello, RAWRity. :)

I figure if I add quotes it could add about half a page
on my c++ projects
[Alpha]: then everything changed when the fire nation attacked
heyo RAWRity
mweh.

then I'll never have to write another paper
:D
heyo BoroBrony
i see TR are kicking ass go TR :)
:)

This is why i don't throw parties. i never feel any different when it's my birthday. Oh well life moves on.
Pretty goof. How about you? :)
BoroBrony: just chillinwatchin stream

yep
Yep.
BoroBrony Curse you TR scum! :D
haha I wanna do that too
they would just not call you
hells yeah killerpony7733
:D
they would toss your application and look at the hundreds of others they have to read over
If its a big company
but if its a small one they might get a kick out of it :P
maybe, but you'd still probably never hear from them
or you could just screw around at a job interview
Ohai :)
I also want to get a bunch of movie prop money
I'm extremely cynical about the job market at the moment
ohai
walk into a mall with a backpack that accidentally unzips and spills stacks of $100 bills all over
and see what people do
75% of my applications get nothing
thats common.
The ones where I get interviews I never get called back
do you press them afterwords?
Heya MaxTheBrony
call in a week later and ask how its going
The last time I did a job search, I got two interviews out of however many applications I put out. Lucky me one of the places liked me enough to hire me. XD
dam right :) TR FTW lol and hi MaxTheBrony :)
I used to, but I've heard that that usually just annoys them
because everyone does it now
So they just delete all the voice mails of people asking about that
:p NC Ftw Not TR :D
Hi everypony :)

AJIsAwesome: it's the beta?
Yep.
what is this game about?
You have to pay for the beta.
Socks: Koihime Musou. Its A Visual Novel I Got Online (18+) Its About The Romance Of The Three Kindoms In An Alternate History Where Most All Of The Heros (Probably Most Known From Dynasty Warriors) Are Female lol
AJ are you streaming?

05,15Voting closes at 7PM EST tomorrow too, so yeah, hurry up :p
how do i check what Intel that I have???
AJIsAwesome The game is F2P but beta and getting in it is either by random beta key given from signing up and waiting or getting alpha squad
Ok, thanks Laurayne :)
Shes Stupid Strong And Never Lost A Fight xD
fluttercry: There were 2 1990 TMNT movies, right?
05,15I dunno. Never liked TMNT
Okay.
In The Real Romance Of The Three Kingdoms, Lu Bu Was An Insanely Strong Warrior Who Was Known For Being A Traitor To Every Master Hes Known.
I am learning ALL the new thing!
:P
HOW DO I SEE WHAT INTEL I HAVE???
dat soldier never gets tired
Retail. XD I didn't know what I wanted to study, so instead of spending money on something I may end up realizing I'm not into, I just decided not to go.
AJIsAwesome: I think there were 3 TMNT movies.
T_T CAN SOME1 ANSWER MY QUESTION
I Could Ramble About This For A While Though And I Dont Want To Get On Anyone's Bad Side... =w=;; If Anybody Wants To Know More About What I Know Of The Romance Of The Three Kingdoms And Koihime Musou (Even Dynasty Warriors) Let Me Know, Kay? ^_^
I'm talking about the 1990 one.
Michael: tired is for the dead lol :) :)
pleaese :'(
what Question?
That's smart
BoroBrony: LMAO
Pink3: Intel has a problem that will tell you. What os you on?
Looking back I think I really should have done that
I actually kind of enjoy the pace and atmosphere of working in retail for now, so I figure I'll stick with it until I find something that really calls to me. If it does and I need a degree, then I'll go to college.
program*
Keir: Os?
its true Michael lolz :)
Pink3: Operating system
Operationg Sysytem
Keir:XP

D'aww... No One Wants To Know More From Me...
/me Pouts
Everyone and everything in my life in high school was pressuring me to go to college
i like the pic Michael sleepy twi :)
im sorry Laurayne I asked Geneally
:)
Hmm...?
Michael: :D "I love sleeping with myself!"
Eventually I just picked a college without any idea of what I wanted to do just to shut my parents up and make them give me my laptop back
alright just cleared 4,000 emails :P
MadSurge: :)
Pink3: right click "My computer" icon and go to properties at the bottom the general tab should show you
They tell you you can just do general education credits for two years until you figure it out, but that's completely untrue
Did they help you with money to pay for college?
doing that is a good way to stay for an extra two years
AJIsAwesome: derpy with glasses :p
Yeah, they did
Derpy Persona! :D
It was supposed to run out this year but I've been working so much that there's still a little bit left
Why does that sound familiar?
I Beat Persona 3 / FES / Portable :P I Own All 3
what degree are you getting?
computer science
oh yeah that's why
Hi
I think I picked literally the worst school ever for that degree
Keir: How do i check how much RAM my cpu has

Hi, NxPaqu. :)
I think I'd be perfectly happy in something like retail to be honest, but that won't be enough to pay my loans back
He already knew it was the scary maze game.
I didn't show it to him either
i see why did he play then
Does that not spoil the suprise somewhat?
hai NxPaqu
Hi NxPaqu :3

WTF YOUTUBE
STOP CHANGING
Cause Shes Shy :P
Oh :D
STAPH
youtube sucks even more now
I dont know what to say....that college really did screw you
Agreed ^
second that ^^
what did they change this time?
To be fair, Youtube, while becoming exponentially more annoying, has added exponentially new things.
but you will get the degree, it cant be a total loss
Fun things.
/me Covers My Ears "Oh Noez Its Starting!" D:
Like shows.
Reikim: Agreed.
i was fine was the last change, even though it was annoying, but now theyre asking for real names and they arent allowing you to hide your channel. if you dont unhide it, they delete it
Did you know Funimation has a Youtube page with a crapton of their shows? For free?
My Fantasiez Is Comeing Out! >.<
Youtube keeps changing things for the sake of it
http://i752.photobucket.com/albums/xx170/redyuri12/untitled2.jpg
reallY? I was allowed to keep my non-real name....
I'm looking forward to CoH2
Some features on new youtube I don't mind but the new style of video player bugs out like hell.
xD
nittany was told to set his real name
11,01twilight_sprinkle: Wut?
I Have FUNimation's Youtube Page In My Bookmarks xD
11,01Oh.
And Reikim, yes, I watched quite a bit of Full Metal Alchemisy on it :)
Laurayne: Same here. :D
They only ask for real name if you choose to use the stupid +1 thing.
Nittany_Discord: didnt you say youtube asked you for your real name a while ago
*Alchemist
11,01Yeah.
11,01I just remembered that.
13http://i.imgur.com/Ra1w1.jpg
Nittany_Discord: I was allowed to not do it, did you have that option?
you know, i hate names like Elisabeth or words like Elite. i always think someone pinged me
brb
thats dumb, and so is the fact that they delete your account if you didnt open it to everyone
Shizuka: Cookies? :3

Most people at that school go into education
Or business/theology/other stuff like that
Laurayne: I want that sword. :O
Nah Not My Style. I Prefer Bigger Swords
Like Buster Sword Big?
Hmmm...
Since I was a dumb teenager and didn't know anything about colleges, I picked it because they gave me the most scholarships
Or Tetsugiya big?
Is that how you spell it?
just deleted my youtube account
*Tetsugaiya I think
[Alpha]: Who did? You?
eeyup
Why?
Tuition costs over $30000 per year and they basically gave me half that in scholarships
http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/angelrei/Others/girlsxswordsinsaneld1.png
That Big
Woah :O
I felt like it needed to be done
THat's a giant sword. :O
Doesn't seem sharp, though.
Laurayne: perfect waifu for sephiroth
So I thought since it was a private school and more expensive than others it would look more presigious on resumes than the public school ten minutes away
Well, "that" sharp
Who Needs Sharpness When you Can Flatten Them xD
:D
like clouds buster sword
Enemy Sees Sword: Ha! That THing isnt That Shar... *Squish*

was*
It does
huh, jsut realized, besides Serperior, I have no Gen V pokemon on my team
a skill is called 20% cooler
Just letting you know, Eli:
Don't buy the game just because it has pony references in it.
^
yea, what if it sucks?
Make sure you buy it because it's a good game in general.
It is a pretty good game
like i said, now everyone is going to be doing it for publicity
AJIsAwesome: :3 don't worry. but i was thinking about buying it anyways, it's just a bonus point
well not everyone
Eli: Oh. Okay then. :3
I even hid a pony in an FPS game that I am making
Nice. :)
you cant kill it.
you won't look at the first party companies doing that stuff

Hey guys!

Hey SafariMonkey!
I could never come up with jokes like that :(
Eli: -chan is usually for younger people afaik
thelonepony: good. my "mangaish" isn't that rusty
So what are we talking about?
Alchemist: I can come up with dumb yet hilarious jokes :D
*Cries And Notices* Wait Whaaaa? o.o
SafariMonkey: weird stuff :D
twilight_sprinkle: i think it's more like a "cute* form. we have something similar in swiss german
SafariMonkey: talking about Oniichan~
:O
Oh?
MadSurge: so a horse walks into a bar, and the bartender asks "why the long face"?
Turn around and say it again!
twilight_sprinkle: then 4chan means "for kids"? Seems inappropiate, which is appropiate considering its 4chan.
OniiChan~

Laurayne d'aww it looks pretty
Nope.

wat game is this?
this quick interview about Aurora Dawn in DerpyHoovesNews is interesting
Alchemist: It's never maid hour. :(
Planetside II
thx.
Alchemist: did 4chan start as a cute image site? thats the only obvious connection to chan i see
speaking of maid outfits: today i saw the Big Bang episode where Sheldon gets to wear one... scarred for life
dunno when was the last time I saw the maid prefix in front of nittany's name...
Is Wrek playing?
What did I come into? o/O
mmhmm
Yes.
<#
<3*
less than #
Wrek: You need moar music :P
twilight_sprinkle : 4chan was never cute
Can I Take This Maid Outfit Off now? ; _;
twilight_sprinkle: I have no idea. when I heard about 4chan it was already the abomination it is today.
a japanese site
Laurayne: Sure. :)
and it was mostly about anime
http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/27500000/Seems-legit-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-27599282-306-360.jpg
so maybe 2chan was for cute stuff then
hasn't 4chan always been like that
11,01Yes Laurayne.
twilight_sprinkle: maybe it's short for channel?
sparkarez: WUT
Eli: thats what i thought
twilight_sprinkle, 2chan is pretty much an image board for animes and manga I believe
le shrug then
>le
lol sparkarez

but i dont see how its offensive
Facebook keeps getting in my history and URL suggestions even though I don't visit the site
so people add a"le", whats so bad
it's misused
Il est Cinq Heures moins le quart.
I know

MadSurge: i havent seen them call themselves biased, idk. but they should say it every 5 minutes with the bullshit theyre saying
twilight_sprinkle: if the show hadn't been cancelled the grand finale would have been an episode where they debunked themselves and showed stuff they got wrong or they were too biased.

twilight_sprinkle: at least MJ should be legalized
05when peopel say legalize drugs
i've heard that maruana over time causes some kind of brain damage, i've also heard that theres a teapot orbiting the sun and that it is the one true lord, so who knows what to belive
Eli: marijuana?
lololol
05they dont say legalize deathdrugs as crack cocaine
05its simple
The whole weed thing is BS.
awesome shot
twilight_sprinkle: yep. i used to be a pothead
I don't think Bronystate is a weed thing D:
11,01Legal drugs can be just as bad as illegal ones.
Eli: how would legalizing it help
Of course.
Nittany_Discord: That.
Nittany_Discord: Fun that it's both sides being pounded. :P
"tell the truth on this show" bahahahahaha
:D
Nittany_Discord: like alcohol?
I assume this one is on guns. Sweet.
twilight_sprinkle: at least here it would help. it would be less "cool". which would stop a lot of young ppl here
MadSurge: sure doesnt sound like theyre saying theyre not biased
???
Nittany_Discord Isn't morphine extremely addictive?
11,01No.
twilight_sprinkle: please stop complaining. :/
Thank you! Gun control is BS.
LOL
Majwana hate may be bullshit

MadSurge: im not really complaining
But i prefer gun control T-T
Anarchy !
anyone here?!
05legalizing marukana isnt for the potheads, its for the goverment. less harmless people in jail, less wasted resources, no black market.

twilight_sprinkle: yeah... it's not even that enjoyable. i prefer a nice game or a good book. I used to do it when i was younger because i thought it was cool
Wrek is a smokah

05im sure pot would work even better and do less harm at the same time
Tit sling XD
titty guns
MadSurge: i already said it though, im not complaining, im saying its a biased show, because i want others to understand that
Eh, I heard that the only stress relief you get from fags is actually just becuase they make you breath deeply.
sup... i just wanted to say that i´d like to see this psa bulliyng stuff... but i cant watch it, because my i promised to watch the walking dead with my father... what now?!
wrek also pot dosen't have aditives to it like most tabacos do
11,01Funny. Heard that there was more tar in a marijuana joint then a cigarette.
Eli: hm well idk, i dont know how enjoyable mj in particular is, maybe legalizing it would work

If self-defense was dangerous, I'd of killed someone by now.
brony90, i'm not ure what 'this psa bullying stuff' is, if its on the stream i can't watch right now for various reasons
Shizuka: because, if you take away guns, the true criminals will bring in guns from out of the usa.
D: NO SHIZU! D:
guns = good for children when their older
Wrek: doesnt ever household in sweden have machine guns or something?

05though if i were stupid enough to move to the US
actauly you don't need to have a license for long guns such as rifles and shotguns
the issue is keeping the gun locked away then
13it's the black market that makes them so available
only for small fire arms liek pistols
Wrek: You would :).
I like Archie Bunker's method for airport security. You give everyone a gun on the plane to use as they see fit then they return them when they get off the flight.
It is ok if you have locked away guns and licenses.
Since when did BState become a debating website?
Wrek: Aren't we too patriotic for Sweden already? :P
it says "the stream starts on friday 4pm EDT" (newsletter)
its their fault killing them selfs

the guns are not for criminals, dari. Criminals would prefer nobody have guns. Criminals tend to be huge and intimidating. That all goes away when a 5' nothing woman has a revolver.

Libertarians are basically anti-state. They think government needs to be out of the way and basically just build roads and run the military ideally
11,01One's a party that wants little government (and legal marijuana), and the other is an ideaology.

saying that gun-free zone and shootings are related is pretty fucking stupid

00,03even*
guns are still stupid and pointless to own i dont get why people "need" them
Goodnight alexxm :)
at the end of the day, guns are equilizers.
it's that gun free zones are usually areas with many, many people
no-gun zone or not, if people are allowed to buy a gun, they can bring it anywhere
Night alexxm !
13Dark_Horst: which means more targets
Nittany_Discord: To a point, that is. Because, im still annoyed that when you vote, the votes arent what choose the presdient; The repersetive of your state vote. He can dismiss your collabertive votes at his/her lessure.
DJPON3:Thats right
Cya alexxm
05oh look hes from IRA
so that's why shootings happent here. becasue there are many fucking people
05or was that NRA?

Nittany_Discord, have you seen him in the debates?
DJPON3: :D
he was a former member of a gang
11,01Yes Kandarihu.
owo
Nittany_Discord: Yes.
13if you want to shoot a bunch of people, and you have a choice between a "gun-free zone" where no one is armed, and a space where any number of people you aren't shooting could be armed, you're going to pick the gun free zone
13you are guaranteed to cause more damage
^
Nittany_Discord: ;~; our teacher told us
DJPON3:wat?
.-. wat
BRB
...Oh dang
wat?
ouch
"no gun zone" is pointless unless its enforced well. whats important is that people arent allowed to buy it
D:
why am i suddenly lagging?
13twilight_sprinkle: but the point is criminals. don't. care.
....Oh my god.....
though most criminals arn't so logical. The point is that people with guns are either responsible or irresponsible. Stop making it harder for responsible people to get guns
Nittany_Discord: hi
twilight_sprinkle: i agree with you :P
what did she say? i lagged over it
11,01Hi Twilight.
Well that's the government's fault for deciding that there should be 'gun free zones' when guns are legal
ello
13you are not allowed to buy a gun, oh well, i'm already going to break the law so i'm just going to get one anyway
lali-ho Twilight
yeah, weapon regulation is a bit odd
horses
13you're only putting the innocent people at a disadvantage
twilight_sprinkle: Have you ever heard of the prohibition ? people will get what they want

elllo Dken2021
you can't let everyone have guns, but at the same time you can't stop everyone from having them

Hi Derpy_Hooves :3
Shizuka: but this way non-hardened criminals wont have access to such easy murder . real criminals will ambush you anyway. of course, having no-gun zones that arent enforced well in a country that allows everyone to buy gunsis dumb
hi TheLonePony
Im not sure if making guns illeagle would help because then like drugs there might be a black market on them, ibut i dont know anyhthing about guns
hi Twilight :3
Wrek: Seen the video of where the Police shoots his leg? :D
there are of course a black market for guns
more ppl have been killed with chairs? think about that very closely. BULLSHIT

where do you think criminals -get- guns?
CCCP: It's not about safety , it's about the fundamenta right to ensure your own survival
Shizuka it would be bigger

i reckon there should be some training, like getting a boat here in aus. 2 day course where they explain how to captin, safety equipment, signals and the like

I CAN UNDERSTAND IT.
children at school should have gun safety classes
i know TheLonePony
i'm slowly starting to HATE that show
Again :P
i must say i agree with the Amazing Athiest on this topic
insane in the mainframe
Shizuka: because its very hard to tell who got them legally and who didnt. if guns were illegal for everyone, itd be obvious when someone got them from the black market, and like i said, it doesnt allow that much protection
Dken2021: Membrane*
CCCP: > 2012 > Listen to fat whale > mfw

it'd be obvious, after the police are zipping up your body bag twilight_sparkle
BLAMING DUMB PEOPLE FOR USING THINGS IN A DUMB WAY!? Hell no!
/me pouts
fuck
Alister i know but he somtimes actually has some good points somtimes
13that doesn't help at all though twilight_sprinkle, you have still created a world where criminals have hilariously easy access to guns and innocent citizens can't defend themselves at all
^
i hurt myself
The 2nd protects the 1st.
how are you going to defend yourself from a gang of thugs if you don't have a gun? They don't even need the gun if you're unarmed
Shizuka: It's not even about safety , it's about the right to ensure your own survival
they'll just beat you up
dat fake war
i agree, that most laws against laws are usless. the thing that would work, is destroying all guns. but again, THAT is a multiple billion dollar industry
criminals do not -need- guns if their victims are unarmed
13Eli: then criminals just start importing
Eli: im not giving up my gun
05hahaha
Guns are illegal in the UK, you don't see people gunning down everyone here, because law abiding citizens don't have guns.
stop thinking about the lowest denomination. Citizens need guns to defend themselves from both criminals and the government
im not giving up my right to defend myself
MURICA
Shizuka: but they already cant defend themselves properly, thats what im saying. the only thing legal guns allow is let everyone kill others. even for the deterrent purpose, the more people with guns there is, the more people that arent afraid of such hypothetical detterrent when they can ambuysh anyway
... yeah and i'm sad about this Bronysith
just like many things, one would need to change people's mentality. somehow in many many countries burglars dont bring a tire iron with them let alone guns...

Hello
You kinky walrus!
Panda|Homework: That's like saynig this statement is false. :D
>Kenny G
GOOD LORD
Lil_B: No shit, Swedish Woman. <3
Shizuka: IKR
he did?
oh snap!
AJIsAwesome it is though :/
well screamed more like it
11,01Polygraphs are also fun tools used by talk show hosts.
Nittany_Discord: Oh god...
/me polygraph tests Nittany_Discord
Nittany_Discord: Besides, best Lie detector is....
Nittany_Discord: Common Knowledge
Shizuka: although in Penn and Teller: Fool Us, they're out of character and Teller is much more talkative
Nittany_Discord: YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER

I must take off, I have some stuff to take care of. Take care BroState!
Toph is best Lie Detector.
11,01LadyCanary: Phew.
Bye, Everlasting_Joy. :)
11,01I was scared there for a sec.
Nittany_Discord: thats because you are the mother
^
11,01O.O
WUT
:D
when it comes to 16 year old AJIsAwesome, Nittany_Discord, YOU ARE THE FATHER!
11,01But how?
Happy Motherhood Nittany_Discord !
:D
Sith, I actually laughed at that.
MALE PREGNANCY
/me flitters into room
Panda|Homework: I'm 16?
LadyCanary: yay..
OH GOD IT'S JUNIOR ALL OVER AGAIN
11,01Didn't even know I could become pregnant.
o/
^^
05this is a very itneresting episode
LadyCanary: I hope it's not as boring though...
why can't you just...ask him?
11,01Do I have to be a chick now?
<---- That Divorce Actors
Nittany_Discord, but you can. havent you seen that one movie with arnold shortsenegger?
HA-low
that bitch be crazy
13personally i think the lie detector output has no correlation with whether you're lying or not
11,01I have Panda|Homework. He took a serum.
...very trusting
aaaaww, lookit how sad he looks
13BUT, it's a good way to intimidate you out of lying
<--- "Ask" < "Lie Detector"
They look so enthusiastic.
Nittany_Discord but he got prego~
He's such a dumb guy. :D
00,03Wait... guys can be pregnant? .... :3c
11,01Because of the serum.
Polygraph tells whether you're stressed or not, is my take on it
Nittany_Discord but he got prego~
If someone is polygraphing you before you've married, bitch be crazy, get out of there
05if they have a womb Scoot-Scootalooo
ehhmmm... Ben and Teller is kinda hit and miss I notice... they made a Great episode about PETA, but what I see here and saw during the Gun-Law previously I do not approve :/
*does
In my Mind, It Would be? Polygraph? You Want To See if Im Lieing? Fine, I Was Lieing, I Dont Love You Because I Didnt Know You Didnt Trust me. Cya
/me flitters off to a dark corner
it presumes you're a.not a sociopath. b.not nervous if someone asks if you're a murderer
And quite a lot of people are stressed when they're lying, but then so do people who aren't depending on what they ask you
13but like i said i think it's more for intimidation, the guy administering the test can interpret the results any way he wants
getting interrogated stresses you out
11,01But I never touched fertility serum.
nothing else
... yeah... you can be telling the truth but be nervouse and fail a lie detector test... I know... ive tried.
13scare you into whatever he's aiming at
Hallo?
Yes?
Wrek: I want to check the Swedish general rate of Lie Detect beeps for ANY questions.
Brb, gonna go get ice cream cake \:3/
Lucky. :(
Wrek: We ARE one of the most "calm" people around :P
hm...
Only beaten by Finnish and Norwegian
that reminds me
I have to go eat .__.
05Vordox: do we even have polygraphs?
Wrek: Oh yeah we don't XD
W-wat are we watching ponies?
...wow.
the cops pressure and intimidate witnesses and suspects ALL the time
my chat derped and it says my name is already in use...
never talk to a cop
ever
Sprite-Bot: some bullshit
and that's how people with lie detectors manipulate the results into whatever the fuck they want them to be
their job is to arrest someone. if you talk to a cop you are wrong
TheMaster a little impossible in the ghetto >.>
don't answer their questions, ask for a lawyer
objection!
they follow your ass
just know your rights and don't let cops trick you into arresting you
thats bullshit too. You dont HAVE TO swear to god in court.
All these fancy polygrafs... can't we just use some Monografs?
don't let them search you illegally, tell them you don't give your consent, ask if you're being detained and on what charge and then invoke your 5th amendment if you're under arrest and then shut up
Yes you are :D
13Lil_B: no no that's just putting your initials on something
Hiiii~
Lex Luthor! I knew he looked familiar
"we're not emasuring nervousness" fuck you
05the polygraph is as bad as holding a finger on someone feeling their pulse, and deciding if its a truth or lie depending on if you feel the pulse at the point of answer
God I Love Penn xD
RULE BROKE
never talk to cops, its not their job to find truth, its their job to arrest you and put you in jail and they're very good at making people violate your own rights
"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, unless its an STD"
:p
so don't talk to cops
wat
yay job in Iran
0,5Hiai
Ryunosuke: Or physical scars.
11,01I wish personality tests on job applications were banned.
hoi BaconMane
HEAVY ISH SHPY
... damnit I forgot Citizen Kane >.<
Hi, BaconMane. :)
00,03Nah, then I would be out of a job, Nittany_Discord :'(
05Nittany_Discord: a company over here had began using one
Hi BaconMane :)
05they were then sued and decisted by the gov for rigths violations
Hallos BaconMane~
ha
....and we branded this guy a traitor? Oh fer.
11,01They're commonplace here Wrek.
ENGINEER ISH SHY
05theres even laws in the works makign it illegal to force say saharign facebook stuf fetc
*SPY
05like
Wrek: OH GOD you HAD to remind me of that?!
11,01We need those laws.
05i fire you cause you said this on face book
Poor guy. :/
<--- They found out about my dislike on my work through facebook
i fire you and unfriend you from facebook! ;_;
Companys over there just don't have the right to ask you personal Stuff, you HAVE the right to LIE IN THEIR FACE should they dare to ask you something private
wow, 1 am already... gotta go to bed. Goodnight everyone!
Goodbye Alchemist2
bye Alchemist2
Vordox There is a Universaty here that requieres you to have a Facebook account >.<
if morons want to post information abou thtemselves on a public forum anyone can see they deserve to lose their job
bye Alchemist2
a job is not a right
bye, Alchemist2. :)
11,01I hope those laws come about soon. I doubt a ban on assessment surveys will happen anytime soon, though.
lol Lil_B
learn self control and awareness of yourself
TheMaster: So... I cannot lose my aggression at home so I have to do it at work instead? SMART!
05in fact acera care got decisted when they refused to keep company secrets public
05oh and theyre a gov funded company
:o
no, you can say what you like in your own home. but don't post about it on the internet
05gov funded companies are forced to keep secrets public
SPY
the same way you can't scream the N word in the middle of a store and not expect a reaction
the internet is NOT private. unless you set your facebook to totally private
TheMaster: So buck Free Speach and Free Will?
Jesus.
free speech doesn't mean you're not responsible for it
again, you can say the n word all the time. good luck getting a job for it
xD
and nobody is stopping you from posting your drunken binges on facebook
but your boss can see it
and his customers can too
TheMaster: I wonder how that works in Sweden...
ah yes
the ass is power
At most we get a slap on the wrist =P
:D he's right
No Comment....
05how what works?
yes i am
DAMNIT PENN, STOP READIN GMY MIND
they cought me
Oh god that feels too good
Wrek: If company finds out about our opinion on stuff at work
0,5Oi
lol
Wrek: According to TheMaster You deserve to get kicked, and not improve the Work place.
/me calls 1-800-555-anal
11,01I wonder if class-action lawsuit waivers are legal in Sweden?
haha
Tl;dr: the lie detector reads only your nervousness, and with training you will be able to fool it.
facebook is a public thing, you need to be mindful that anyone can see it
05legally, you cannot be fired for something you do on your spare time
05in reality
Oi BaconMane :)
well then thats being in the UK
05they do have the right to fire you anyways
0,5hihi
05but if you are fired for it
Heya BaconMane
05you can go to the uhm
05ombudsman for your area
Wrek: Or Union
05which will look into your case and see if they violated your rights or not
I thought it works like that: You think about the Number and the Number will get drawn on the Polygraf :P
HA. That's amazing.
05no not union
Yay!
mfw RAWRity
05thats a different thing
11,01Might have to quit Facebook if I get this data entry job.
It's that easy to fool? XD That's pathetic
I WAVE TO YOU

Yaaaay!

that shit is tasty
WUT :D
oh hey
err ok
polygraphs
:D
TOOT
aka Bullshit
again, cops are assholes. Don't talk to them
we need James Rolfes - "You know whats Bullshit!"
Wrek: Well then you dont want to work at that place if you get fired for them doing something wrong
so true TheMaster
not all of them are
know your rights, don't talk to them if you don't have to
Wrek: If the company cannot change for the better, what's he point of it's existance?
TheMaster: depends on the cops
cops want to arrest someone. if they can find a way to put you in jail they will
Vordox leeching Money
its in their interest to arrest people they suspect are guilty, its not for them to figure out if you are or not
TheMaster: no, they do not
This poor guy.
Hi RAWRity
cops have quotas. They need to arrest people to keep their job. Lawyers are for figuring guilt out
05most cases they do RAWRity
He's so screwed.
05atleast in the US
Wrek: but you dont live in the us
cops dont care
05most errors over here are cause of incompetence
11,01Hi RAWRity.
cops will arrest you if they think you're guiltty, and they will trick and intimidate you into confessing or incriminating yourself
This really isnt fair for the guy
wb
Wrek: I have friends and family in law enforcement. They do not go out to try and arrest people for the fun of it.
thanks
back in my country cops were as dangerous as criminals, that i know, idk whaqt its like in usa
in the US there are incidents of half a dozen cops emptying their revolver into a car at a checkpoint, becasue he didnt break fast enough for their taste
watch an episode of cops, really look at how the cops do things
yes, there are croooked cops, but they are not the majority in any way.
05TheMaster didnt say for the fun of it RAWRity
that'S the kind of cops you'll meet in the US
Dark_Horst: again, no.
....oh what an ass
:o
its not for fun, its their jobs on the line. Their interest is to arrest people when a crime has been commited. They -do not- care if you did it or not. They do not establish guilt, that is for your lawyer and the prosecution
you know.. is iut actually illegal trying to bullshit the test?
what test?
TheMaster: it's in their interest to arrest the correct person.
Lil_B: its illegal to lie
not really
oh boy
they will make you incriminate yourself
Lil_B: i mean if youre accused of something, itd be illegal to lie
Cue Ball's goin all out
05so look how he turned "i grabbed an arse when drunk" into "i fucked a hooekr in vegas" for the girlfriend
lol
thats what cops do
What an asshat.
05and this
twilight_sprinkle yeah, but they can't use graf as proof that you lied, that's whjat I ment
G'night everypony! :)
well i dont believe any of these experiments, its pretty obvious that the lie detector doesnt do any good
and they scream at you, in your face and do that for hours and hours at a time
05this is true assholery
05douchebaggery
Night GilDash :)
Night, GilDash. :)
05axe to head-able behaviour
what?
Cya GilDash
Lil_B: well yeah, i dont see how the polygraph can help, even if this show is anything but legit
Goodnight GilDash :)
TheMaster: no, they don't. Some cops do that and are then reprimanded and have the testimony gained from that thrown out
oi, i'd like to box this bastard's ears
oh dem actors
night GilDash :)
....
Wow...
Elmer Fudd xD
What an asshat
well she was a psycho anyway. Mike was saved from a bad relationship
Police are not some large, blobulous force focused on making you miserable because they're lazy.
This is really fucked up
Ugh.
How do I get a job like that?
RAWRity: but theyre murricans, all urricans are bad from birth
its not about making you or anyone miserable RAWRity. Its about arresting people. That is there job
Howey Mandell from Hell xDD
:D
Really?
TheMaster: theri job is too investigate crimes.
Oh
:o
DerpyMuffins: I know right? :S
Hey everyone
if they don't arrest people then they're bad cops. Iits not about guilt. Cops are not lawyers. if they think you're guilty they are going to abuse your lack of knowledge about your rights to get you to confess or trick you into incriminating yourself
poor teller
Hi, RainbowPie. :)
05twilight_sprinkle: this show is more credible than you think
Folks, if your "significant other" asks you to take a polygraph....RUN.
05its all about being critical to their presentation
Hi RainbowPie :)
Umm.. I didnt know you guise showed this stuff on here..
they don't investigate. They respond to calls and then arrest who they suspect, suspect, of a crime. They will get you into a situation where they can arrest you if possible
THANK YOU PENN
It means they're fucking nutters and have trust issues
oh mai
Oh, is Bullshit on?
Yes
oGriofa: We don't really do. Just this moment.
How are you AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
ASoftFluffyThing, yes
it is
Yep
Yay
He Doesnt Care. He Got Paid
Hai ASoftFluffyThing :3
CriticKitten or Trust Issue-them back :/
watch a episdode of cops. They invade peoples homes if a door is open. Look through a car, browbeat someone to let them go through their pockets.
Hai thelonepony
Wrek: hardly, i dont believe any of their experiments, even if i cant prove it, but i often notice how they dont provide any facts to support their opinions, and when they do, they completely twist
TheMaster: you forget something. Those lawyers? they base their case off of investigations DONE BY THE POLICE. Thus, it IS the police's job to do as much as possible to ensure that the person they charge is actually the one who commited the crime.
AJIsAwesome: Yea i thought if i wanted porn and ponies id go to 4chan
Porn+Ponies=Me giving up on life.
Who knew that Mr Clean was such an asshole? ;_;
SadisticPony: why?
SadisticPony: r34, there is no escape
CriticKitten: I did. Mr. Clean was also my middle school vice rincipal
CriticKitten: I Knew xD
hi RAWRity
*principal
05thats not the point of the show
Not every arrest leads to a conviction. Any very often people have veyr poor notions of how the law works, their rights and have little access to proper defenses
Bronysith: because, some people want ponies to stay innocent
05the point is to get you to think
SadisticPony: stop being such a sissy
I have something to say
SadisticPony: R34 welcome to the internet
and what I mean is that they weedle you out of your rights.
Who is streaming?
twilight_sprinkle: you think tehy are biased oo?
twilight_sprinkle: ahahahhaha, thats not happening
too*
05of course they are biased
oGriofa: Wrek
05they even admit to beign biased
Comparing Penn and Tellar to say... Bill Nye, is akin to comparing Trixie to Twilight :)
13like i said before, they're both openly skeptic atheist libertarians
They make you talk when you don't have to. violate your right to not being searched. The cops -want- to arrest people and obviously they do not have your interest at heart
here, this looks like a good episode for this issue
my friend read a clopfic out loud to me one day, I can't look at rainbow dash, fluttershy or pinkie pie the same way again ...
Wrek: im thinking, and im thinking theyre extremely biased. and ive heard about them admitting it, but i havent seen it yet, and an ep ago they said they were telling the truth on this show
and hi oGriofa :3
11,01Still wonder if there's a piracy episode.
13nope
Eli: ye
/me 11,01trumpets
RainbowPie: That sucks.
Wrek: you find everything you search for. and if it serves for a good show and you get rich for it, all the better
cops are generally jerks and any randomly good cop is outweighted by the assholes pointing shotguns in the face of teenagers
RainbowPie: and that is pretty damn stupid
I wish I could write with both hands
Dark_Horst: VERY stupid indeed.
Wrek: and that would be fine if the poeple watching it did take this as an oppurtunity to think about preconcieved notions. Instead they use this show as a way to say "See, the other people are totally stupid."
I Wish I Had A Big Burger
13burger? mmmm
RainbowPie: sadly, not stupid on hsi part
They do a special on Ghosts yet?
Wrek: it's like the people who say Religion is evil because they watched Bill Maher's "Religilous"
Dark_Horst, Hows it stupid on my part?
13there's one on ghost busters yes
05religion isnt evil
Wrek: if their goal was to get people to think, they should ask more questions, and say "thats bullshit" less
00,03The people are!
13YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER THE WHOLE PLACE IS OUT OF ORDER
13YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH
Dark_Horst: I don't control what he reads
13ohai rei :3
/me noms on fingers
Shizuka: THIS COKE MACHINE IS OUT OF ORDER
Religion is funny :3
05any kind of extremists/fundamentalism is inherently dangerous

the cops will not hesitate to violate your rights

if you do not defend your rights in a bad situation more likely than not the cops will find a way to arrest you
Nittany_Discord: yay
It's the black guy from the Walking Dead game!
Hi Reikim :)
LOL
Hey Reikim
11,01Enjoy.
Wrek: I agree. But "Religulous" is a movie that focuses on the extremists, and is then used by tumblr posters as evidence that all religious people are crazy and stupid.
:o
13DUN DUN
I hate Law and Order :D
Centerlink why you stuff up
05RAWRity: which makes said tumblr posters idiots
RAWRity: Eh, stupid people are always stupid.
this show always chooses to show the most extreme extremists, actors i suspect
Dat Teller
Dark_Horst: called having a good imagination, Its not my fault if i can picture the scene perfectly and i dont know about you but i for one dont want to remember ponies are porn
00,03I sell gun-ane and gun-ane accessories
/me dusts Nittany_Discord and pours lemon pledge on Reikim
as*
how quickly would penn and teller be discredited if they were proven hacks? I doubt this isn't accurate
Oh god, Lars Larson.
did i just get kicked?
they play to a niche audience, where is the incentive to lie?
Eli2: most likely
TheMaster: theyre already cancelled
RainbowPie: i haven imagination too. i'm still able to see canon and "fanon" as two different things entirely. it's not hard
if you suspect they're lieing, look it up
Dark_Horst: its not hard, just disturbing
If you arrest people, crime stops. It's magical. :D
MAAAAAAAAAAAGIC
yes, be Harsh onm crime, BUT WHEN YOU ARE HARSH ON CRIME, Than watch out that it hits the right people!
RAWRity their not all crazy, they just don't really except fact.
people are making way too much of a deal out of porn. WAY too much
its just porn
Dark_Horst Yeah but what can you expect?
05ill show the porn episode afterwards
it's just porn guys
seriously
Oh boy wrek
TheMaster: i could, maybe i will a bit later. but i dont need look anything up to see they dont provide enough facts adn avoid all the main problems with their claims
was just wondering. Wrek i think that came out wrong myself. i think the "organisations" that call themselves religions are evil. not all people in religions are evil.
Shoo be do
most of the people sent to prison these days are non violent drug offenders
not terrotists
its just porn, get over it, not that big a deal
Idk if i said my words wrong but porn is porn... i just dont care for pony porn.
most prisoners are people who were caught with weed, non violent drug users
...wat
Bronysith: almost nobody said anything..
popelice
SadisticPony Then stop bringing it up cause bs main does not really like that topic
....
that horrible, horrible man. Thats damn fine police work
damn fine
WAT
._.
meh whatever. before i start spouting more BS i'm off to bed

Oh god this show
13Nittany_Discord: 2010 i believe
bye
What are you guys watching? (Is streamless)
i think the root problem with the criminal justice system, is that our prison system is private corporations
Dken2021: the La Li Lu Le Lo? Metal Gear...:D
they use prisoners are virtual slave labor now. Naturally there is no conflict of interest in such a system whatsoever. -sarcasmoff-
Eli2: okay, wel ltil tomorrow then i guess :)
yes... I think my point states... Be hard onn crime, but be very very sure that it goes against the right people
Sketch_Toku_Brony dwarven greeting!
05arent the prisons in the US private?
there really isn't much more to saY ABOUT THIS
11,01Don't think so.
wrek they are
13some are
Wrek: some are
13not all
05...but whyyyy
Dken2021: ah i see lol metal gear came to my mind hearing it :D
you know who gives the police the nice equipment they use to catch speeders and traffic violators? Oh right. The insurance companies.
Because capitalism, Wrek.
because cost savings
13Wrek: means less out of taxes
because people are dumb and don't pay attention
and don't care
11,01When did prisons become private?
05but that means its a profit organization
how is everypony?
Teller would buy that for a dollar.
05which encourage malpractice
11,01How would they make money?
hi AVS619 Doing well and you? :)
exactly wrek
13actually... i think i'd have to look into this
and now they are talking about forensics...ill brb
Nittany_Discord: put the prisoners to work
the cops have a total conflict of interest, the states prosecution system has a conflict of interest, the prisons have conflict of interest. There is no way to win in the criminal justice system
13my first instinct is the government pays a private prison to hold a criminal
05only thign i can think of is if its a private company
05but gov funded
13but that's not much better than the government running the prison itself
05yeh
I'm pretty sure the US pays private prisons to hold prisoners.
Nittany_Discord, that and I believe they get ... some money from the govt for keeping prisoners
thelonlypony: im doing well too
I still think we should build a wall around the english coast and put everything above a certain crime level there
05ratehr have the gov drive it directly
CriticKitten: either that or Tax cuts/benefits
05than a profit seekign company
AVS619: In not Lonly :P
13i mean unless the private prison charges less than the cost for the government to run the prison itself
he looks pissed off xD
yea soyy i messed
in the past judges have been bribed by private juvanile halls to send children to their facilities despite not really having a reason to

He's always pissed off

Ciavarella, 61, left the bench in disgrace two years ago after he and a second judge, Michael Conahan, were accused of using juvenile delinquents as pawns in a plot to get rich. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has dismissed 4,000 juvenile convictions issued by Ciavarella, saying he sentenced young offenders without regard for their constitutional rights.

Hi guys :)
13hm
Reikim: i was giving that to Shizuka
Hi sonicdude558` :)
allo sonicdude558`
13wiki article doesn't go into much about *why* private prisons pop up
others just happened to see it
twilight_sprinkle: don't worry :) i'm fuked tomorrow but i lke to sleep late anyways
see? Cops do not care about your potential innocence.
They pop up because complicated reasons.
cops want you to go to jail, that should scare you.
Why would you help them?
Society. Economy. Politics. Probably a bunch of other factors.
yay boobs
HELLO!
Eli2: lul :P well i just sent the request and it found you
owo
lol wut
dat science~
My guess is that it's cheaper for the govs to pay a private firm to run the prison.
Mmmmmmm
because boobies
um...wha?
Boobprints! :D
Wow i'm surprised no outcry about nakedness
yes. they should start doing that
I think everyone in my family has a strong hate for cops.
Me Gusta
BOOBS
.... it's only science if you Document it Guys...
13that won't work because a) men, b) men have hair there
I totally want to become a crooked cop in the future
The prison probably absorbs some of the cost via prisoner labor. In theory, anyway.
13it would fuzz the result, no hair on your fingerprints
because it helps lines peoples pockets if its not government run.
CCCP: go to hell
its corruption
twilight_sprinkle: good. sadly, i'm on the only computer in the house that doesn't have skype installed :) i'll accept you later
So boobprint?
Can I Be An Official Government Boobie Examiner? ;w;
Shizuka: fingerprints are still better :D
Eli2: k, now go to bread fast :D
Prosecutors are the most evil form of Lawyer
The Narrator reminds me of Ross Scott
twilight_sprinkle: anyways. night. bread?
13sonicdude558`: penn's mind? i'd fund it
yay for justice system
:|
damn fine police work
Eli2: dolan-like way to say bed :P
Bronysith: at least in Ace Attorney land :P
one sec gonna change my nick
Its better for the guilty to run free than the innocent to be imprisoned
twilight_sprinkle: i don't like dolan.
Go directly to Jail, do not pass Go or collect $200
I Promise Id Be very Thurough :3
what did he do
:o
done
Eli2: hehe, its fun to talk in dolan sometimes :D
lol CriticKitten
13yeah sentencing requirements are waaaay out of whack

Oh boy, copyright law.
TheMaster he got a settlement after they stole 2 years of his life.
13the penalty for copyright infringement is higher than murder

We've had this discussion a bazillion times before.
SETH
I know about the doctor one. My father works in a private practice and can vouch for that, his pay is based on how many people he sees.
GOTO BED
11,01It's abused all of the time, and the punishments are draconian at best.
cops forced 3 teenagers, one of them -mentally retarded- to testify against themselves.
11,01And there's no due process in a copyright violation claim.
Let's just back away slowly from the copyright law and move onto something a little less flame-prone.
Like, I dunno
Abortion
:o
...
11,01Which helps make it easily abused for censorship.

13yyyyyyeahno
This is Ross Scott isn't it

they got kicked out of duke

and had their reputations permanently ruined
/me sprays raspberry pledge over Shizuka
Nah, I don't really have an issue with the creation part.
Dis guy
rasberry?
It's really the part with the apple.
So, what's this episode about again?

That poor guy....
Take a couple of kids and hang candy in front of them. Then tell them DON'T EAT THAT CANDY, KIDS. Then turn invisible. What do you THINK they're going to do?
Don't forget the 3 teenagers thrown in prison for nothing

the cops interrogated a mentally retarded teenager for hours. magically enough, he confessed and implicated his 2 friends. Decades later they finally got to leave prison

they did, Bronysith
ikr
Nittany_Discord: hold me?
uh Oh... I Feel A Religious War Comeing on... o.o

no actually. The bible has not really been tampered with
i lost my bible a long time ago
ok, I'm of for... today... damnit, already 1:40am ... see you in maybe 10 hours
Lyra|work: i think they added in the whole "no gays" during translation
Nittany_Discord, i love anything you sy, because its in a beautiful shade of aqua <3
i dont have a bible
...What are you guys watching now?
13but anyway i think they're not using the KJV one cause when i followed along the quotes didn't match up quite perfectly
How about we all just act like atheists for this one?
Remember guys, the big guy talks to distract you from the little silent man!
but I'll leave a Statemnent about the Bible anyway xD
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqpuxdZN421r0ojhto1_250.gif
Bronysith they did ALOT of ommisions
the Masorites were very, very, very, very, very, very hardcore about making sure the old testament was the same as it was originally written
also, without ace ventura, i wouldnt know how to spell beautiful
Religion, huh?
13i think this one is more for taking stabs at fundies
:) I'm DEFINATELY going to hell for this but I REALLY don't give a toss.

you wouldnt be going to hell
I'm permagone until this blows over.

lol
I hope they don't directly compare the old to the new testament
i dont mind religion...i do mind WHEN PEOPLE SHOVE IT IN MY THROAT
odd, i thougm ythbusters couldnt do that
suprisingly enough. The catholic church takes the bible very seriously. Don't worry Wrek. any translation error is going to be just on synonym basis, not on content
Pizza!

ahaha
oh shit
oh boy
Well, I guess that counts me out - grew up in church since before I could speak
they did a lot of the important scholarly work. The bible is very well translated and has been for thousands of years.
give me pizza
Well, it bothers me when atheists SHOVE THEIR DISBELIEF DOWN MY THROAT
religious nutters time?

LadyCanary: have you seen the Young Justice episode that came out on iTunes before DC Nation was put on hold?
I don't see why people get so hung up on whether the bible is literally true or not. Just read it as good literature
Why are we watching this?
ohai sonicdude558
Why not?
11,01Lyra`: Taking funny stuff?
i think the bible was an amazing troll played on humanity

sonicdude558, because boobies
sonicdude558: cause Wrek wants to
the hebrews were originally polytheistic
sonicdude558: Dont like it? Dont fucking watch.
13TheMaster: point of the ep is people going around claiming it's literally true
mmmmaybe
13point of the show is calling people like that out :3
dat os
LadyCanary: calm down, he didnt say anything bad
yahweh (god) is actually one of many semitic gods. Yahweh is actually the Thor of hebrew mythology
Dont think so, RAWRity
so god is thor
im died
I find most religious debates interesting - I gain a bit of new understanding listening to the different viewpoints
twilight_sprinkle: he was being an ass
You claim you're only going after fundies, but the level of ridicule the basics of our faith face render anyone who isn't a total atheist a fundie.

Despite the bible's story, according to which the Israelites originated from Mespotamia via slavery in Egypt, the evidence indicates that they were native to Canaan.[1] Yahweh, however, was not a Canaanite god, and modern scholars see him originating in Edom, the region south of Judah.[2][3] The goddess Asherah may have been Yahweh's consort in the earliest period. Originally the main god of the Iron Age kingdoms of Isr

Elvis is jesus
makes sense
Shizuka: the most adorable peace treaty ever <3
See, but that's what the Bible was trying to do: tell stories. Parables are VERY common literary tools in the Bible used to indicate proper ways of behavior. A lot of them aren't meant to be literal.
Oh dear, religion argument?
Bronysith, ever heard of such a thing as responsibility?
false, Roger Federer is the king of kings
05you can blame me for that dari
no, but i do, LadyCanary, i promise that i can make you filthy`
How about moderation?

Elvis is alive and so is tupac

AHAHHAHAHAHA
LadyCanary: you're god?
/me bows
CCCP people take religion seriously because they put a lot of their identity into being religious
No no no RAWRity O_O
RAWRity: new church?
Im just a bird!!!
it look good
/me flails
when you talk to them about religion and disagree you're basically attacking their identity
Shizu: I didn't say it was GOOD morality. God in the Old Testament is a total wanker.
LadyCanary: dat canon now
13:3
probably the one with paprika
a bird with spaghetti on her :3
I meant to say Im good!!!
cause paprika is badass
"just a little"
Shizuka: the Old Testament's God is a dick :|
05my guess is also paprika
POSSIBLE
Not god!!! GOOD!
13does he get more into the "i'm a good god" in new?
AHAHA
FarFetch'd is ok Pokemon
...Did they just defend The bible? :O
Why not cinnamon, Wrek
Alright. Moderator 4 is gonna have LadyCanary ascending into godhood.
you would need a big boat
no shit sherlock
Shizuka: yes, surprisingly
/me 13is still ded in that universe :<
...Im okay with THAT RAWRity. xDDD
where's the velociraptors?
the point is magic though
Shizu: God is an asshat.
yes. every predator and prey species of the world. take two fo em. keep em alive ona fucking boat

LadyCanary: :D
no such thing
LadyCanary: damn Pastafarians
Shizu: Yeah, New Testament God apparently started taking his happy pills because all of a sudden he loves everyone
wat?
its a myth invented to scare children and people who don't think about theology very hard
But seriously, I meant to say good, not god ^^"

Old covenant vs new covenant guys
CriticKitten: to paraphrase Lewis Black, the Old Testament was meant to scare the Jews into calming their shit.

Spoilers: FLUTTERSHY MEANS NOAH
TheMaster: The effect is the same. God screws his follower for basically no reason except to fuck with him. :P
13see, that's a much better story
we all know LadyCanary has a bigger ego than Lyra`
FLUTTERSHY IS NOAH!

I dont think I have an ego.
the point of job you're suppose to take away is that bad things just sometimes happen. You're not suppose to question god.
Jose!
see, youre talking about youre home already
05that girl remidns me of you LadyCanary :<
i dont think elvis did drugs
05:|
05*
that has been proven, but not in the way that most people think
I heard that they mistranslated 'red sea'
? What girl, Wrek?
Wrek thats LadyCanary :O
:|
TheMaster, God has to respect the free will of the people he created. That doesn't stop him from giving people warnings not to do certain things.
when did sarah silverman revert to a child?
RAWRity: Yep! Old Testament God is a vengeful asshole, New Testament God is a hippy. I think at some point, God developed MPD.
LadyCanary: everyone has an ego, but not everyone has egos the size of kenye...
It was meant to be 'reed sea' or something.
Chrysalis lol
05check stream LadyCanary :o
LadyCanary: You got on TV? Nice.
So these guys ARE defending not only the bible but the scientests? Wow!
But when they translated it from the Hebrew they got it wrong or something.
Im watching stream Wrek. The lady passed quickly.
Exodus- great story
because god is a DICK
Or WeSker, Bronysith
Egypt dun goofed
LadyCanary: i havent played that resident evil...
When jesus talks about hell in the gospel he's using a metaphor for a common burning ground for garbage. Gehenna. its a metaphor, not a literal place

Look at it as just morality stories and a groups story about themselves
I'm not
just saying, Job's a pretty good summary of God being a dick for no adequately satisfying reason
I havent said a thing

idgaf about religion
Mer?
im not bashing religion, its too easy

Judiasm as a religion is a religion of purity and atonement for sins.
NEW TESTAMET: CANON
Life of Brian is awesome :D
Yes, he did.
i think jesus existed. i also think that the stories about him are obscenely exaggerated. also made up by his followers

Awesome RAWRity.
13oh yeah that episode
oh then there was history of the world
I learned about it from...well being Jewish.

RAWRity but...didin't that covered Hannakah?
Hey Josephus
Shizuka: because god is dead
hesus
YES SHIZUKA. YES. DO IT <3
you should just read the bible
in the end, jesus was probably just another random carpenter. jsut happened to be a little more neighbourly
You dont fuck with the Jesus.
Were the stories recorded about him accurate? Eh. Up to speculation. But I find it pointless to speculate that the foundation of the religion is based on a fake person, that sorta seems....pointless to even consider.
none of that miracle gunk
CCCP: Job's Behemoth - starts at Job 41:15
Dken2021: they did Chanukkah too

Ah damn I thought there was activity.

lol Scoot-Scootalooo
This room is basically dead isn't it.

TheMaster, they picked out which books comprised the bible.
Scoot-Scootaloo what's wrong with that?
Council Of Nicea was a bit more important than a committee

Don't do bad stuff

It's a frigging statue!
TheMaster, yes they were.
05without interruption this time
or~ i could just hug LadyCanary
most of the important founding fathers were deists

/me kills steal murders theft takes lives
What about SaxyJanitor?

the founding fathers that established this country were deists, olden day versions of athiests
...The hells a graven image?
the 10 commandments can be summed up in one sentence, from Bhuddism. basically: Do unto others as you would have done unto you
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc1g212J8f1qezg8qo1_1280.jpg
you bible and you faith are important
ELVIS DIDN'T DO NO DRUUUUGS

look up the jefferson bible

05thanks Scoot-Scootalooo, thanks Shizuka. you got him to shut up. really helpful
u suck wrek i hate admins

Do you know what Divine Providence is?

Actually there were fifteen, but then Mel Brooks dropped the third tablet
"These 15 commandments..... These 10 commandments!"
Ryun: /)

Oh, the bible.
controversy isn't bad
13crack..
im high 6_9
these 15 commandments
13umm ... THIS ONE COMMANDMENT, THOU SHALT CARVE COMMANDMENTS ON BETTER STONE
Ryunosuke: :D That scene is timeless
/me crash
I don't like these arguments, its stupid and ignores the obvious problem
00,03Nittany_Discord: But that will run me out of business :O
10, 10 commandments
Paul already settled htis
Commandment number 1: Shut the hell up
Shizuka: tHOU SHALT FIND A PIECE OF PAPER.
13StinkomanFan: sec i'll look it up
xD
13used to know it
Comandment number 2: THERES NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THE SON
/me is shamed
sun*
right Nittany_Discord, I come here for anime, not this kind of stuff
05something: final chance~ explain why you hate me. or i will take it as you dont hate me
Lolol LadyCanary
I prefer this one Commandment, Keep thy religon to thy self
13Kandarihu: fundies
00,03Commandment number 3: There are no more Jolly ranchers, they're all gone!
this argument was settled IN THE BIBLE
wrek u r mean
The first commandment is that you don't talk about the first commandment
05ok so I am mean
05what else?
read paul's letters to eveyrone
hello everypony
they do that with a quran
Shizuka, what fundies?
ur dum
Hi Freefall29
and shit would hit the fan
oh no its a real live troll
hi Freefall29 :)
In this segment the Buddah is holding a bible
/me puts up a forcefield
he says you don't need to be jewish. These arn't issues anymore
13pretty much where it begins and ends, fundamentalists that take the book literally
...Wait what?
Heya Freefall29
hi Freefall29
Oh shit, sonicdude558
wrek, hate doesn't have to be rational. In fact most of the time hate isn't rational.
wrek ur dum
Is it possible that Jesus walked on water because it was ful of salt?
"First commandment: I am your only god, bitches. You will accept no other, for I am the real deal, and I am all that there is."
Wrek: clearly he hates you because you kissed LadyCanary
This is sure to stop the troll!
05so i am mean and dumb. (thats how dumbius spelled btw)
13StinkomanFan: ah i was right, the idea that you bow to god and not build a statue or some idol you worship instead
CCCP: it wasnt the dead sea
05what else are yoru reasons?
dumbius
oi old guy, we have proven that complex carbon chains can form through random events
rape all the womans
the point is they mean the biblical literalists think its 100% true, but its not
=_____________=
Fundies is too broad of a generalization here.
So... when we bow to Celestia...?
Shizuka: Building a statue of God with which to worship Him is a-ok, though.
05Lyra`: i went sudden latin
something is just trying to troll/get kicked
Hello everypony.
me thinks someone is using something 's account
i know, it was awesome :D

13but it's still god so okay by them? iunno
sonicdude558 oooh, where?
Shizuka why?
i hate u all
Cool.
lol
someting is
lol
bible says though shall not worship idols
TheMaster, Deists believed that God just created the world and left it alone.
found him
05well dear something. i have considered the reasons you have given me, and I have decided to live up to your expectations, and permanently ban you without any chance of appeal.
the bible has a gun included?
Now thats a good use for a bible
00,03stahp something. ur drnk. stahp
13yay wrek
i need to buy the bible
they say A god. They never said it was Yahweh

that creeper teller
aww, teller is embarased :3
best disguise ever
Why do you think the semitic storm and hill god is any more likely to be the one true god than Thor or zues?
XD
Shizuka: the general consensus seems to be "Old dude with big white beard"
I like Thor more, he's got a hammer. Yahweh isn't close to as cool as Thor
unless Eating is a religion, I am non-religious
Statues less so, Shizu, but there are many many paintings. He also shows up in medieval art basically any time you see a light source.
wat?
wat
you guys ever seen the church of google?
Thor > YHWH
wat
Hes a mage
/me sneezes
im okay with genie teller
behold the internet
hey, I just noticed something
YAAAAAAY PORN
haha the internet
Yay :)
rule 34
dat monitor
that is all
The Internet is for Porn!
pr0n!
Have you noticed that?
The entire basis for Penn to claim that the Bible is a terrible source of morals was from the old testament. It's the old law that passed away.
ahah
Oh god.
try and match my l33t debate skills. Thor vs. YHWH. Thor has a hammer, and he's in movies. Thats why Thor is the superior god.
good old pron
hahah
Ooooh! Porn!
I wish for a pony
13she's right though
dem special effects
i wish i was a pony!
This is going to be fun.

Preach it sista Shizu
Caught watching ponies - hides screen & says it porn >_>
you really can't be agnostic though
herrrrrrrro FillyFlam
13okay infinite car
CriticKitten, the old testament is there to put the new testament in context.
Wrek and thors hammer is fucking badass
Okay guys, bedtime for me. Goodnight! :)
I believe according to someone if you watch porn you are more likely to commit, which is clearly bullshit
either you think theres a god or you don't
OH MAI

i like this episode already
suddenly porn on bronystate
uhh, whate were we talking about?
Wrek: obviously they thought you were asatru or something.
If people ban porn, people will go out raping
But what about the WBC?
You can never prove god exists. PERIOD, you have to accept him on faith alone
Porn is porn :D
this video is funny when you play avenue Q while watching this.

uhh, umm.

oof

what the heck happened?
After this episode, I'm going out for whiskey for this weekend :)
and Allegr0 comes in to the porn show
yay spirit tits

PRAISE TITTIES.
hi Allegr0! Get out while you still can!
Chrysalis: I'm what o.0?
grow up people who are uncomfortable. its just sex
they do porn
Allegr0 watch the stream
>North Carolina
whats wrong with sex?
twilight_sprinkle: If so, it worked all too well. Japan's not meeting the necessary child-bearing quota to maintain its population.
>oh lord
Get out Allegr0
SPIRIT-TITS OF JUSTICE! word of the week
you can tell by the guys clothing.
While you can
sex is one of the most natural things people do

Children avert your eyes
Mega_Milk: lolol means I'm blushing
i will agree with her there
mmmnn rawr
<3 satin
. . .
y'know, i've always wondered what it's like for kids of porn stars. Like, imagine you hit 13, start looking at porn on your computer, then all of a sudden you see your parents doing the horizontal monster mash.
is anyone actually uncomfortable? Its just sex
While I go find my camcorder
sex at strip clubs isnt prostitution if it is recorded, then it is labled as porn
lol I am having a good time reading your reactions :)
Allegr0: the show busies itself with reaonably bashing bullshit. this episode: "porn is evil!"
CriticKitten, there is a great deal of abortions going on in Japan, I hear. That's why the childbirth is so low.
RAWRity, I imagine they would be scarred for life and never look at it again
lul
TheMaster Nope i find this hilarious :D
uh Wrek
/me leans in unconfortably close to Lyra`
Kandarihu: why?
hahaha
Pregnancies are happening out of pure lust without love.

Feminist.
Of course.

Her "theory"
This woman has no breasts.
its HBO, they cant show penetration
Nothing!
p4ngya, my opinion is that people need to calm their hormones, im not in th mood.
I've heard charges that porn is nothing more than a way to promote prostitution. I'm not so sure of that, myself.
she's just mad she didn't get to be in porn
by her logic, every man on the planet is a fucking rapist
LOL

Ass or titties?
...what
i enjoy porn pictures, i dont really care for the actual videos >.>
i keep losing focus on what the stream has, because porn and the stream has porn, and the chat is not as good
Titties, poo comes from ass

Well.....
its rape if you say "DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME"
because if no meant no, everyone would be a virgin
....
Oh yes. Stammering DEFINITELY alludes confidence.
Nice work lady.
some people can actually talk another human being into having sex with them
if consent isnt given or cant be given its rape
wasnt there a study on this
I have!
LadyCanary: But she's got a doctorate degree! D:
2 studies
but they couldnt find a large enough sample size that hadnt watched porn
p4ngya, the rapists claim that rape is nothing more than "surprise sex" and it's what the victim "didn't know she wanted"
And this is why all degrees are not created equal.
CriticKitten: From Uptight Uninformed Bitch University.
Kandarihu: no, that'S a 4chan meme
LadyCanary: So that's nice going "Doctor Lady"
:|
I love Princess Molestia tumblr, funny and great drawings

You're too young for this, BaconMane.

Go to bed.
lol happy people
Oooh!
i think hes happy
it's official, I hate Emolgas!
Kinda sorta.
its not degrading
how is it degrading?

Okay.
You gotta be kidding me.

-lol
No facehoofing can describe the stupid
So, Chrysalis. Does lust taste like love or what?
0,5O fooohck
LOL
StinkomanFan not really
women are being paid to be in porn. whats degrading about it?

man, she made porn boring
God damn it, I can't say anything about this!
boobies
Those kids look riveted
wat
....
wait wat
Well
wat
Did she just make porn boring?
NO
....
TerribleFact: in Conneticut, there is now legal precedent that women are in "a constant state of consent" unless otherwise stated, and thus it legally isn't rape unless the woman says no.
come back when its DVDA
that escalated quickly
they arent even listening to her
NO
Oh my god.
Child porn = normal porn = rape?
._.
NOPE
I'm a filly and WAT

soooo?
Certain times yes, I find it degrading.
/me is a man who enjoys his porn
Kandarihu: cant argue with that. its a dispicable pratice
...its not because they look like children. who would even...what?
men shave their pubic hair too
...yeah, right
woman you have no idea what your talking about
is it stagatory if youre both under aged?
the only one with twisted logic is that woman
Chrysalis: *you're
The audience look either confused or too distracted by the picture
But that's not the point. It's for pleasure purposes.
Lady.

What are you doing.
maybe people don't like hair in the first place?
Lady, stahp.

CriticKitten: ikr
Bronysith you are aware i barely passed english right?

Look at him
Chrysalis: sorry, meanwhile has conditioned me beyond belief
pls, LadyCanary stahp
Nice, scout19_tf2
WB scout19_tf2
I really despise non-scientists who made sweeping generalizations without any sort of data to back it up.
personally I like it when they shave lightning bolts or racing stripes into their pubic hair
just like the debate last night. They use awful, awful logic and awful, awful non-facts
hell, i actually DID fail one of my english gcse's
scout19_tf2: Looking sharp there tex :3
i like to shave mine into a heart :3
I keep shouting show me the study. I just wanna see a study :x
Uh.....
Didn't mean you, LadyCanary, I meant the twatburger saying she has no studies to prove the bullshit she's spewing. :P
that "women make 75% of men" 'fact' came up yesterday at the debate. and one of my students used it too. its such bullshit.

ohai fluttercry
Just making sure. ^_^
This woman is basically earning a living making up wild claims and then not doing anything to prove or disprove them.
11,01We're not showing that again.
who here can't handle boobs?
good
the censors have returned
00,03SO ANYWAYS.... How 'bout dat Derek Jeter?
;__;
How about we watch the episode on Ghosts Nittany_Discord?
Scoot-Scootalooo who?
TheMaster: da fuq
He's gonna be out for 4-5 months, Scoot-Scootalooo
05,15That was terribly inappropriate. And we're sorry about that. Anyway, how bout dat baseball
funny, that was actually less flammable than religion though
What was innapropriate about it?
fluttercry: -lol
did he just change the embed?
but yeah, i guess its for the best
baseball sucks
fluttercry: Go Red Socks?
Pitching or recieving Fluttercry? ;)
what did i miss?
so wait, Wrek in big trouble?
TheMaster Good question. Guess we'll never know
I dont care for baseball - my hometeam is the Astros :|

That was interesting.
Did the mods suddenly remember that middle schoolers hang out in this channel?
Middle schoolers shouldn't watch it then
guess we know which side of THAT arguement the mods were on :p
this is the internet, the big boys room.
/me is for whatever side is for the boobs....
so what are we doing now?
We're not responsible for what they see. You can literally look at nudity on google in 5 seconds.

Nittany_Discord, i find what you said offensive
you're canadian, your age of consent law is like 16. you're fine
that doesn't mean a damn thing, does it?
Imbed switched!
and its not like you're permanently scared for seeing tits
hey Shizuka is wrek in deep trouble?
about that thing, the one time
:3 http://bulk.destructoid.com/ul/user/2/25438-214118-PONIESjpg-620x.jpg
O_O
anyone who cannot find porn on the internet, fails at life :)
age of consent varies from state to state
inb4 wrek has been banned off the streaming site
And country to country
Wrek should not be in trouble. Theres nothing wrong with boobs. Bullshit never even went below the waist
i would be really grateful if you could switch the embed back to mips again. limeV is down for me here. again
11,01Lyra`: Sorry, but we have standards.
every single person in this stream -has- boobs
what is offensive about it?
So...Wrek banned?
you can find porn without even looking for it
TheMaster: da fuq
05,15TheMaster let it go. it wasn't appropriate to be shown, therefore it was cut.
But I like Wrek :'(
fine. whatev
i dont even know what we're talking about anymore, Nittany_Discord XD

I dragged my XChat over the stream all episode long. Kind of what I do for my pony fast, only I covered the WHOLE stream this time.
so, while we wait for someone else to take the helm, I present to you the third romney/obama debate!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
Why is it okay to show R rated movies like fight club but not a episode of Bullshit?
is someone streaming right now? cant tell, limeV is pulling that maintenace crap on me again
05,15TheMaster I said cut it out
no Allegr0

Ohhhhhh
05yeah and its annoying me
Oh good, Wrek isnt banned
05anyways lets see
wrek when was the last time you defragged?
Looking away from the chat and the stream for a while. What the heck happened? Was that ep of Bullshit too hot for Bronystate?
05too logn ago
might be a part of the problem ;)
J_E_Smith71 apparently we aren't that mature enough, sad really
ASoftFluffyThing agh, no thank you. I gave up on Epic Rap Battles after S1 ended. Don't ask me why, I honestly don't find it funny any more.
05J_E_Smith71: yes it was, but i still crashed
....that was glorious. Especially the ending
The episode was so hot, it made your computer crash.
balls so hot
/me grabs meanwhiles cinderblock and hits DeadpoolDash with it
So is Bullshit banned, or just that one episode whatever it was?
00,03So anyways, this exists http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHOVRhN5yTA&list=PLC3CAD22F3C1E41EC&index=102&feature=plpp_video
Allegr0: the eagle won. definately
tis a fleshwound
I wouldn't consider that hot, just too sexual.
J_E_Smith71, I'm guessing just that episode but I'm not gonna go into it
J_E_Smith71 that one ep probably.
