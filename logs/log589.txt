11,02I saw it, not played Okami though :/
I'll see if I can get a screencap of his tail, kirz.
Once is enough.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egl076EHmFU
8,6:)
0,14I heard Okami
SuperBrony64: its a Rpg for people who dont like Rpg. so much wii-related fun and great comdey...and the main charter is a white wolf named Amatersu. a whitewolf SUN GODESS BOOYAH
Who's gonna stream?
Okami?
http://z0r.de/L/z0r-de_2715.swf
and you draw stuff, and that does things in the game
cachi_maid01: here you go full episode
Just click it
Okami was a ps2 title originally
i really should finish okamiden ds
Who's gonna stream?
8,6going to work on a picture for something coming up, for part of it I'll need to draw a modified version of his tail and I want to get it close >.<

and wouldnt really call it an rpg, though it has rpg elements
I was wondering who has Okami
I suspect that Spice and Wolf will pop up in the future of Bronystate.
FYI: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc1SH5hWMLE for those who want to see the Shiz Demo Reel on Youtube
/me really needs to finish the game
WEE! MLP miny marathon tomorrow! :P
Firelight: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
0,14I borrowed Okami once
StinkomanFan: why are you so awesome?
8,6if you don't have safesearch on and don't like what you see, don't blame me
SuperBrony64: you should buy it. for my area, its level 3 rarity. only once every 3 gamestores you find it
ohai ThePretender
ThePretender: *huggles*
0,14and then it became the second greatest game I've ever played
8,6especially if you're searching that particular site lol
Polydunami: I love that anime. I watched season 1 on netflix and bought the season 2 dvds

I clicked in the middle of the ep and came out right at the beginning of Giggle At The Ghosties :)
11,02How do you classify those levels? o.o
Ponies47: i wont have pony marathon :(
SuperBrony64: or epic mickey. Im so suprised its fun to play and to even look at.
Spice and Wolf == Economics the Anime

Yep. Come for the unclad wolf girl, stay for the economics.

owloysius *nomz* huggies <3
owloysius: the folktales worked into season 2 are also nice

Mine was Party of None. Pinkiepie randomness partially hooked me, it was how the ponies acted that got me. that and the singing and some mysterious charm it had
nope as far as i can remember it always stay in the water
wait discovery kids is still around? I thought hub replaced that
cachi01: ewwwwww. Discovery kids

cachi01: Oh? What happened? :)(
season 3 is in 2 months and season 2 in mexico is in 4 months maybe :P
*:(
I was meaning to rewatch some MLP at some point anyway, so I was happy to help :L:)
Big_Macintosh_1992 lol its cause the CCCP (USSR) kind of fell :P
Ponies47: fucking slow discovery kids and their slow dubbing

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU THIS SONG WAS NOT BYBOB MARLEY! :[

cachi01: yep. that guy shoudld've kicked bear grills in the ass.

I thought you meant like 4kids dub where they dumb down the lines
http://e621.net/data/4b/54/4b54492e9cb9d0e4749a6a21f808993b.swf
what if 4kids dubbed MLP?
imagine 4kids dubbing mlp... oh god....
actually it don't almost every ep is 22 minutes right ?
Okay, okay
god help us all
cachi01: the sad part is he gave up his job to his DAUGHTER when he died. as much as she disgraces his role, its so amazing that he did...
22 x 56
it's already english, you're safe from the horrors
That's still
/me tabulates
let's cut those 2 minutes, 20 x 3 = 1 hour
Just imagine what 4kids would do to derpy.
Ponies47: from friendship is magic part 1 to green of envy? is it called like that?
so 3 eps pero hour
No, tis important
00,10lol you think the show is in english
what 4kids does to anime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5UfIRmkv28&feature=related
2 minutes makes a difference
mishia: oh. screw the french, the spanish, the ...
/me stalks Sumica from a clfif
cachi01: O.O I don't reconize that name
still 52 between 3 = 17.333
1, 231 minutes
mishia: i didnt mean that, i wasnt thinking
00,10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ars_I3kzOAw
you get a few hours extra to add those minutes
So his name is Casey because of the bat? :3
If I'm doing my math right
Pudge: but yeah, it would suck woudn't it :3
Good dubs of MLP... Swedish Spitfire *Drools* Look it up on Youtube.
Ponies47: i mean green isnt your colour lol
Polydunami: no idea
/me gets lazy and opens up calculator

Allegr0: wrong series
Ponies47: yeah i have watched almost all the pony episodes in english
I'm downloading Season 1+2 on uTorrent . .. currently at 0.3%
otakon: you mean this isn't Beetleborgs?
cachi01: Good. :)
Ponies47: but i would like to hear them in my lenguage :( but FUCKING DISCOVERY KIIIIDS

mishia: the one where they get the eggs and DarkWarGreymon.
Lunar_Brony: Don't forget to seed after ! ;)

Spam is hawt
0,14dat was a good song
CCCP: it's good fried
/me cuddles otakon
Cavalluccio sorry if this sounds like a stupid question, but what?
yup
torrents are the worst way to download things that I've sen
mainly because people are selfish and DONT SEED
Lunar_Brony: to seed your torrent
^
i never seed but well i dont know what seeding does
otakon: .-. you know what makes me sad? lots of people hate sonic x because of how bad it was, when they werent hearing the better voices, lines, story, charters, and the unedited content in the orginal japnese that made it gold ;(
All aboard the pirate ship.
do you have any idea how long it took me to torrent halo pc?
When you finished downloading it, please seed to keep the torrent alive !
2 weeks of constant downloading
:(
cachi01 I don't know what that means. I've only used uTorrent once before
mishia: yeah sadly 4kids manages to butcher whatever it gets ahold of
mishia: that fucking amy doll in the ending SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME
THANK GOD ITS DEAD!
Cavalluccio: why are you so awesome?
Seeding means uploading it
Lunar_Brony: neither me but i thiinnk seeding makes it faser
Is 4kids the reason Yu-Gi-Oh gets a bad rap too?
faster*
mishia: but Rouge boobs....make me feel odd about it.
Polydunami: yes
so who is streaming, vivi?
Cavalluccio oh. Thx
Polydunami: One Piece too
CCCP : Because AJ's my favorite pony :D
Yeah :P
xD
Polydunami: 4 kids think fucking rap is what kids like
Pudge: it's kirzstryfe as far as I know
/me Thinks about Swedish Spitfire, Sits in a puddle of drool while still thinking abpout Swedish Spitfire
Pudge I believe it is kirzstryfe
Polydunami: its the reason i thought it was bad, untill i saw season 0 orginal here on bronystate
seeding is bad for the person seeding, unless the tracker rewards it
Cavalluccio Everypony is my favorite pony!
otakon: oh because she changed her name to djnilla
G3 FTW!
<3
Pudge: no
we're streaming g3?
cachi01: they made a *DUNDUNDAHHH* digimon rap.
fuck yes
I think CCCP is broken O_O
Pudge: bc it's kirzstryfe streaming as far as I know
So 4kids is the reason One Piece got a bad rap? :P
no
note to self, dont eat hot sauce after not eating for 12 hours
Polydunami: eyup
Ponies ftw /)
DJNilla would have said if she was streaming
mishia: .................... i will get my shotgun
MY EARS
no g3... please....... for the love of god
okay then
hey everyone
lets watch newborn cuties
G3 is shiz
cachi01: why raps? at least now cartoon network reliases that raps are good for insulting, not for complentary

Big problem?
RainBowJack no, kirzstryfe
RainBowJack: kirz
Love me Cherliee crack verison?
Firelight: i am gonna have to disagree with you. i think the 4th is art of the dress
Better be blueberry muffins at least.
okay
MystertyPony: wacom?
dovah I know that feel. Hardware or software?
AJTheMightGamer: Ah.. Yes.
Jmo4267: screw that, i want poppy seed!
i think they all suck except for smile
Touche.
cachi_maid01: what
imo
Black Dynamite Is on.. Wut/
Lunar_Maid: Software.
oh and this day aria
superretroworld: thay sell tablets! dont use your mouse!
This Day Aria is like number 6 for me.
cachi_maid01: i like any type of song, so almost all MLP songs are ok for me

greenday?
Dovah oh, I got nothin'. Sorry.
Number one Song of MLP History is - Love Is bloom
/me throws a mufffin at Dovah
OMG fuck it love this song.

This day aria is tied for number one with love is in bloom
21 guns?
well, for me at least
I like "Three Days Grace"
love is in bloom is IMO the WOORST SONG
......./)
/me Releases control art restrition lvl 1
AJTheMightyGamer: BBBFF=love is in bloom for me

cmc theme and smile share 1st place =D
Whats with the emo music?
Anyone even like "perfect stallion"? come on, sweetibelle pulls it off perfectly!
Firelight: not worst but bad lol
Ad!!! Ragequit!!!
Maid_Angel: me too, smile is #2 only because the season 2 finale was beast
superretroworld, it's called a tablet
cachi_maid01 It isn't even bad. It's great. But my Second is winter Wrap Up.
CrimsonPhoenix: oh, xD
Firelight: i love winter wrap up!
I get the strong urge to start drawing again
superretroworld: yeah i think thay use Wacom Cuntiq! but that`s rly expensiv! i personly have a Wacom Intous!
i mean its a very well done song that even sounds like if it wasnt from the series
Graphic tablet to be exact
thats why i dont like it
Buck it kirzstryfe wtf is this called!? :[
not a computer tablet
i dont like pop lol
Firelight: do you like sonic the hedgehog?
AJThemightygamer: Meh.
MystertyPony: how much was it?
inb4 do you like bananas?
im going to write with the nose NOSE POWERS ACTIVATE
AJTheMightyGamer: yep! the This day Aria got alot of people with the qaulity. I think my two favirotes are Finding a pet and FLim flam brothers. One for the musical insturmentals in the backround that made me go HOLYSHEET and the other for the lyrics and the male singers giving it the right feel for the song to work
though they werent singing
who's streaming right now?
Maid_Angel: amen brother!
they were talking in tune
cachi_maid01 I can type with my nose
hi ikm caschimus
Maid_Angel: I really didn't like a Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash Duet...
damn that was suppose to say hi im cahis nose
cachis*
Firelight: the reason i ask is because someone mixed winter wrap up with ice cap zone from sonic 3. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGiGIbYt3Q0
Typing with your elbows again, cachi_maid01? :D
Do you spot who I spot? (its not a video link!) http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=311
0,14no non-image links, AJTheMightyGamer
Polydunami: nose! :D
wait i will try to write with the elbows
current download speed... 2 bytes per second. Fail.
nhk
11,01Nose!
shit
cachi_maid01 i typed this with my nose.
Firelight: rainbowdash and Fluttershy dont work well togather, i just loved the insturmentals. also, the song was less of a song that was supposed to be there for a reason to dialouge in singing form. Flim Flam brothers song had a purpose to be "sung" or talked in music: they were trying to sell a product, and musical influcence works well
superretroworld: i paid 250 euro i think! but you can also Get a baboo for about 70 Euro!
ThePretender: whoops sorry, i forgot. you got it. no vid links
ThePretender: wait... so it has to be an image link? I though ti was just no video links..
that took effort!
suhyi8 FUCK ITS HARD
Lunar_Maid: lol
god summer is starting to end :'(
Maid_Angel: Hm... Still hear the love is in bloom Extended remix Verson.. by erm.. The aviators?
0,14technially, it is "non-image links", but people tend to link videos, and that's much faster to type
dat art
dat cupcakes
0,14dat acapella
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 half way over for me . . . I'm sad
I like acapella
and sound effects
cupcakes cupcakes cupcaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakes
dat heavy sandvich
Sandvich

8,6Sandvich!
xd
There's a sick rainbow factory acapella.
this is why I have not read the fanfiction . . .
SANDVICH
sandvich!!
Also, hi all.
SAMMICHES FOR EVERYONE
/me Hugs Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2 "I know!" :'(
WWOOOOOOOT! SANDVICH
MystertyPony: cool
superretroworld: i have a baboo aswell! you dont rly need a Intuos!
SANDVICH SANDVICH SANDVIIIIIIIIIICH
AJTheMightyGamer, I'm listening to that mashup you sent
Alright Everypony Take a seat. I Got This.
. . . WTF?!?
and....it aint that great for a mashup
SAndwitch!
Firelight what you got?
SANDVICH!
he didn't blend the songs well
MystertyPony: they both work fine?
MUFFIN!!
cupcakes dosent count because the pinkiepie charter is supposed to dialouge sing, so she is exsemt from the "singing without reasons" rule
scotaloos wings
Lunar_Maid: Oh it's nothing special... It's Just MAH Bass Cannon!
i dont like this scootaloos wings version
8,6scootaloo's banjo, technically
superretroworld: yeah! its not that big difrence!
IMO pinkie guy version is the best
k
Firelight I see what you did thar
UR MEH GURD
but in pinkie guys version its a little sad
cachi_maid01: Coceru makes a pretty good Bubble berry
WUUUUUUUT?
CrimsonPhoenix: well, it was supposed to be some kind of mash up. I liked it, but oh well... i agree he could have done it a bit better.
. . . huh
Why am I suddenly reminded of Earthbound?
he could've done it way better
cachi_maid01: Coceru is a "pinkieguy" singer. he certaily pulls off the "pinkie as a guy" thing well
omg the scariest creepy pasta ive ever heard of so far! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FztuiSqZPMg&feature=plcp
maid hour is close to the end
Maid_Angel: oooh lol no here the artist is called pinkie guy and he makes original brony metal songs

How do I make someoen go into private chat?
00,03... Melons?

cool song, what is it called
Scoot-Scootaloo: you know..... facade...
Firelight: first you need a crossbow or better.
brb
cachi_maid01: not sure if portal 2... or pewdiepie facade\
White_Lightning: Spring by Griffin Village (or JackleApp)
Firelight: right click name
FACADE!
Firelight, right click on the person of choice in the user list and click on query
00,03...noooo
Facade is kind of a glitchy game, isn't it?
i just found out about facade and i fucking love it!
cachi_maid01: was i right?
AJTheMightyGamer: eeyup lol
WTF is Facade?
reminds me! tonight is "listen to/read creepypasta". this time im not reading them. Since i always spoil the video :| ruining the tention that the read verison genrates
hooray i wins!
Lunar_Maid: its a very awesome game
download it
and play it
you will know what to do
I've only seen a video of it by raocow, cachi_maid01.
Polydunami: you must play it!
pink unicorn?
Huh
cachi_maid01 . . . nah
red
it looks pink
Lunar_Maid: its a funny game!
..?
Lunar_Maid: you can speak with the characters
cachi_maid01 so is "Drinking is Magic"
cachi_maid01: hvoes is it?
Woah!
Lunar_Maid: when do you take a drink?
Now that's a nice pic :D Good blending in
Lunar_Maid: lol drinking is magic?
Lunar_Maid: oh right, whenever a pony verison of a word is used!
Apparently, you're a third party to an arguing husband and wife. That's what facade is :P
so whats goin on?
its a unicorn
no. Drinking is not magic. Beer itself, perhaps, but not the act of drinking it. I quibble with this assertion!
00,03I... still don't get it
Maid_Angel I'm thinking of something else. cachi_maid01 I'll post the pic. brb
hen3ry - you obviously haven't made a social gathering out of the act then
anybody got a guess whos the unicorn?
i have had a stressfull day, time to wind down
MirrorImage: social gatherings are the exact opposite of magic.
there's a reason people will have vast personal bars in their basement
and hell, my boss has one of them
cachi_maid01: we sould have a Bronystate friday drinking night! get somepeapol thogether and Drunk chat!
Scoot-Scootaloo: just play facade and type melons...
Polydunami: and because its a text-game that reconizes the weirdest things and dosent know the obvious, fun is had! like getting kicked out for saying "watermellon". try it, its atoumatic loseing
back
MysteryMaid: heck yeah!
this song is putting me to sleep
welcome back Ponies47
freaking trip and grace melon haters
Wait, who is streaming?
/me Shakes Pudge awake "STAY AWAKE MAN! STAY AWAKE!"
White_Lightning: poniees were meant for that
RaveBrony kirzstryfe
Ponies47: i got 2 hours of sleep last night
Lunar_Maid: Oh, ty :)
AJTheMightyGamer: Thanks mate :3
Pudge: O_O
Ponies47: its still maid hour! you should wear a maid dress *places ponies' in her new rainbow maid dress that i stole from Maid_Discord's exrtra's closet*
Scoot-Scootaloo - yeah, i was wondering about that...
Lunar_Maid: I'm fucking dead. :P
That's no drinking game, that's a dead liver
Next firday is now Bronystate DRINKING FRIDAY!!!
because I was too busy playing Prince of Persia all night
have i just been hit or miss here enough to not realize kirz started drawing?
Scoot-Scootaloo now I dont' get it . ..
Lunar_Maid : if you just watch episode 1 you get to drink alot in the opening of MLP
and if so, when?
Err, I mean "bucking" :P
11,01Hey! Don't steal my outfits.
Lunar_Maid: GREAT i'll grab my stuff!
/me Gives Pudge a warm glass of milk
Polydunami RainBowJack 7 drinks for the OPENING ALONE
Thank you kind sir
Drink up ^^
Pudge: which one?
We're gonna drink until Rarity is better than Fluttershy
Lunar_Maid: its missing "whenever a pony-edited phrase is udered"
First one for 360
Lunar_Maid: or would that kill the player?
(gives Pudge a blanket)
cachi_maid01 you have to take 7 drinks for the OPENING ALONE . . . I suggest recording it
alcohol intoxication is a serious danger.
not sands of time
Maid_Angel - depends on the episode; some of them aren't quite so hard on it
sands of time...?
Lunar_Maid: a drink for EVERY FUCKING PARASPRITE MULTIPLYING? O_o
whoever is streaming should take music requests! :D
/me 11,01dusts Maid_Angel with a brick
HELL YEAH!
Maid_Angel it would. "Boast Busters" is death half way through
THE PILLOWS!
HELL YEAH!
And now we're talking about Prince of Persia?
cachi_maid01 eeyup
Polydunami: i casually mentioned it
Emmie kirzstryfe is streaming
Emmie: it's kirzstryfe and he's just doing music and art so probably not
Oh.
/me looks at Maid_angel omg hovs did this?
Let's make a drinking game out of the pony puns
Maid_Angel can you do that? Can you dust with a brick?
Pudge: I say neigh
for every pony puns you take a shot of straight vodka
Maid_Angel: Not me *applelie eyes*
Lunar_Maid: very VERY gently
Pudge I'm 15, bro
Pudge: Somepony would end up dead.
Pudge: but im 14 xd
otakon . . . seems legit
Oh there you ar, otakon, didnt see you in here. And i thot it was very strange :D

kirzstryfe the stream is funky
19/18 in Canada, Pudge :3
Sumica - but then the brick itself would be dust...
RaveBrony: odd to not see me here? have I become such a feature...
for all ponie that are underage they need to drink redbull
I'm 20 though and I've drank from time to time
Polydunami 19 here
Polydunami: I thought Quebec's limit was 8.
MirrorImage: but then you WOULD be "dusting" with a brick.
00,10yeah like dust for prints
I'm 14! :3
RainBowJack - actually, enough of that will kill you just as well
RainBowJack I drank Fresca
I drank beer once, it's gross D:
damn young'uns!
/me 11,01dusts Sumica for prints
Oh yeah xD
Emmie drink unsweetened Fresca
/me sets a boulder on Sumica s shoe
vodka+chat roulette=loads of fun

11,01Reminds me of the Police Squad! episode.

It's not legal for me to drink, Lunar_Maid lolol
otakon: MEh, to me i guess. Its nice to see a friendly familiar face when many new people come into the chat. I dont recognize many in here anymore :(
/me hugs maid_Discord
Bronysith why did you do that?
if you want a safe underage drinking game drink, try straight lemon juice
/me 11,01hugs RainBowJack
00,10good thing I am not wearing a shoe then
There needs to be a Bronystate meetup :D
/me shoves a boulder in Sumica s throat
in mexico!
In DC! :D
MirrorImage: dear god, that would be horrible
I'm old enough to remember when the drinking age in the USA was still 18. Ah well, there's always TJ.
00,10so violent Bronysith
cachi_maid01: hell yea!
Bronysith are you trying to kill Sumica?!?
How about in Chicago?
Sumica: EAT TOM
WHYYY??!? *watching BOXES on youtube* why did the creeper stalker have to kill boxes. Note: damn, frist scary story to make you scared for the cat D:
Pudge - exactly; it would have a similar result as alcohol in terms of endurance
00,10omnomtom
who can suffer the most
00,03We had one Bronystae meet up...in Bronycon
MirrorImage: nah after a while you enjoy it

Scoot-Scootaloo: Aw!! I wish i couldve gone!! :'(

Bronysith: in mexico!

I live in Upstate NY...i have no excuse for not going.... :(
05where...
Scoot-Scootaloo: dont forget Flaria

Buck is in the UK.
11,01Moonstuck is updating.
05of the staff will be
RaveBrony - well, except they moved it to NJ
i would LOVE it if the next bronycon went to Pittsburgh
MirrorImage: Yeah, but im relatively closer than others
so next bronycon is in new jersey?
I'm not allowed in the UK. Long story, don't want to get into it.
00,03Oh yeah, I forgot Flaria was that big built guy I met there!
I live on the other side of the continent :(
11,01Where is Flaria? He's never in chat.
Short version is, the beefeaters actually WILL react if you do certain things...
00,03I don't think the next Bronycon was even announced!
I would flip a table if bronycon came to indianapolis
y u no make bronystate meetup at bronymexicon 2013!!!
Scoot-Scootaloo - yes, but didn't they say they were trying to make it an every-6-months event a while ago?
Because... Mexico?
so i'm just extrapolating
00,03I would love to go back to Mexico!
I mean come one, we had the super bowl here, why not bronycon?
on*
bronycon in texas.... plz :(
The mariachis would serenade... and they would not shut up till they were paid
we ate, we drank and we were merry... and we got thyphoid and dysentery.
um kirzstryfe what are we looking at?
bronycon was in mexico?XD
Too bad nothing brony related ever happens where I am ever.
Emmie: bronymexicon yes and it was awesome
XAX: whrer are you
I'm too scared to go to a brony meet up because I'm a small girl D:
And I know it will probably be all guys
I'm trapped in my own room
Emmie - small size or small age?
but bronies are nice
MysteryMaid: New Zealand
my door won't open and I'm stuck inside
its a shame i couldnt go to bronymexicon :(

Funny, my ads ask if I like Asian women... or Russian women... or East-European women...
Who's streaming?
Why?
Pinkies4thWall - kirz
HAHA Polydunami.
Maid_Angel: calypso is a bitch lol
My internet thinks I'm a pimp :S
Is it just gonna be pony music all through the chat?
:D
cachi01: he is, but somthing about him is fun :)
Stary - it is "Brony"state
Polydunami: why?
Maid_Angel: yeah he is funny :)
so it's highly probable
meh, I'm not a huge dubstep fan. So far, I've only heard 4 songs I really enjoyed
Stary: not all of it
a bad thing about doing handdrawings i can't do small stuff yet
Zelda Step by Ephixa
although Wrek has more of a tendency to branch out when we watch him stream
Oh, kk
My ads are asking me if I like Asian women or Russian women or whatnot.
Polydunami IKR?
Polydunami, if it annoys you that much go install AdBlock and you won't get them anymore.
oh yeah gotten those before
the living tombstone also made a zelda dubstep song
13lucky... i always try going small... seems to be why it doesn't work..
wrek is fan of viking metal \m/
adblock is a godsend
Polydunami - funny... i keep getting ads for "My Little Pony Toothpaste."
Alpha-Omega-Prime: yeah but it was bad
COLGATE.
BRUSHIE BRUSHIE.
Actually, I'm amused rather than annoyed, Jmo4267 :D
cachi01: except when he *rageface* killed john Doe. right after he rembered he had a family. seriously, whats more compelling then a person with no memeroy who learns of his wrongs, corrects them to his disvange? yep, then Cypt. shoots him.
Kind of yes
13i almost have profile pony heads worked out though.. the neck and body still elude me
Oh you Polydunami.
Such a pimp.
I wish Colgate was my dentist
I smell like bread now :3
Alpha-Omega-Prime I know, he did the Song of Storms, which actually brought me to Ephixa's Zelda Step
that last song was awesome...
i can do a body and neck, can't do a face and eyes right :p
want to trade ?
Maid_Angel: yeah he is a bitch xd
why is everypony always saying that lyra and bon bon are lezbian THEY ARE SISTERS!
I found ephixa dubstep about a year ago
What's kirzstryfe drawing? All I see is a red box around a pink-looking pony.
Dj_Cyber-4G: eenope lyra's best friend is carrot top
Attack|DesktopPoni that is a thumbnail
Dj_Cyber-4G: lyraxbonbon is the most widely accepted shipping
That's what everyone sees
Dj_Cyber-4G - you better sauce that pasta real quick...
and hi
Im actualy playing Zelda right now lol
and i'd caution you against it, because the shipping won't stop if you do
I love Zelda
which leaves... implications.
:| im not gonna]
what most ponies dont know is that lyra's best friend is carrot top not bon bon
Link to the past is my fav
Yep...
ocarina of time ftw
http://cheezburger.com/6438458624
cachi01: Babyface is just sad. seriously, i wonder WHY she ended up in the aslyum as kind and pure as she is, even with THAT nailed to her face. She doesnt reach insanity untill cypt. decied to give her a moral delima .-.
guys i think i'm having stream embed problems. somepony please tell me what appears on their stream panel.
cachi01: that ones good also
Lunar_Brony: Ohh
Pinkies4thWall - a poor quality thumbnail of a pink unicorn with a very gray tail
damn i need to get a link to the past
cachi01 it's entirely fanon, so it's anypony's guess if that's true
ive always kept under the impression that they are sisters and thats how my fanfics are gonna stay :|
you have no stream problems, he's just zoomed in on the little 50x50px thumbnail in photoshop
Pinkies4thWall: the streamer is afk rightn ow
Pinkies4thWall: it's just a thumbnail with music
MirrorImage: pure white Background?
yep
red box surrounding
Pinkies4thWall: kirzstryfe went AFK
the pony that is
cachi01:I can only play it on the 3DS, but i know there is a port of it and majora's mask on the Gamecube >3
Pinkies4thWall: A low quality pony with a red box surrounding it.
MirrorImage: I'm tilting my lapto screen back and I see an outline of another pony
I was out with a group of friends last night. We were stargazing :3
8,6I'm here, just have some stuff to deal with, sorry :(

8,6but at least you get musics :P
Stary: TRULY, IT IS ART!

I'll be patient kirzstryfe
/me hugs everypony who helped. Thanks.
I have the gamecube collector's edition if that is what you are referring to
Lunar_Brony: i dont know if the trading cards are official but it says that lyra and carrot top which its not her real name its golden harvest are best friends
Maid_Angel: the gamecube port of majora's mask is terrible, it's laggier than the n64 one and the sound glitches
pinkies4thwall you were broken on multiple occations ROTFL
Best Art ever made :3
Maid_Angel: i only get zeldas for their respective consoles lol
kirzstryfe: you're awesome. Do what you need to.
13oh.. i cannot do eyes yet..
I also have zelda on my phone ocarina of time and majora's mask
*You're
i have golden zelda 1 and 2
cachi01 meh, I say go by whatever you believe
Maid_Angel: yeah, but the 3DS' ports have smooth controls and everything has a good match.
....
i ment cachi
13i only tried doing a head in the mirror after a shower.. came out looking suitably pony ish.. the rest... not as much
u pinged yourself
yep
i haz The Legend of Zelda for the NES

Maid_Angel: the 3DS port is awesome except for 1 thing

scottish-geeky: do you mean the look to your right one or my OCs one?
In real world, it is.
sooo im a stallion?
My laptop just emptied its battery from 100% to 0 in under 20 minutes
cratorkid I'm touching up on my OC. I need a cutie mark, I'm not satisfied with my coat colour, and I'm being overly picky with my mane and eye colours
cachi01: since when did i say i was 14? havent been that for a loong time
it's possessed
is Sumica home?
If you're a stallion of fourteen, you're full grown.
00,10aye
DeathStar: ? ur oc

Pinkies4thWall holy sh*t!
ohai Sumica

Pinkies4thWall: Good god. How old is your computer?
scottish-geeky: I hope it's not the same one as SB's because that could be confuseing
Lunar_Brony: mine is a pillow. my special talent is probably comforting people
Sumica . . . epic parties?
DeathStar: umm i dont think so
AttacktheAndalite: 4 years tops

Sumica have you seen that Fleur Sculpture?
00,10oh wait AJ blindbag is also to my right

00,10I have not
Estimated an hour.
AttacktheAndalite: Dang o-o
Sumica I got nothin'
Lunar_Brony: i have no official OC but i would have a white coat , X mane ( possibley just black { thats my actual hair} or something mor complicated , like spitfires or vinyls) and the only idea i can come up for a cutie is my ability to argue and debate { i plan on going into polotics), what would that looklike?
I have bruce lee hair
polotics.
/me wants a 12-cell battery for his computer for his birthday
i derped , very tired Jmo4267
cratorkid not sure about the cutie mark, but I can link you to a pony OC creator
Uh-huh
i want my oc to have a ''I fucking love videogames!'' shirt

Ponies47: ohhhh exiding
13totally unrelated to anything... but it's been about as hot and more humid this week... how is it asuka idles at 50C rather than 60 now and without running the fans high all the time
Dang, miscommunication happened there :S
Pinkies4thWall no. I had a night terror about "Want it, Need it". From then . . . well . . .
hi Shamroc
13how does it take two weeks from dusting the interior to it having effect, i don't get it
. . .
hi Shizuka
^
Wait, what? 6_9
13hi folks X3
Hello Shizuka :3
Hey Shizuka!
sometimes i dream that someone has stuck a hose down my throat, and the other end stuck into a soft serve icecream machine at full blast.
hial Shizuka
13it is 1:20am and shizu is feeling loopy
Nice. With where i'm sleeping, I can smell the cats' litter box, and I don't like that smell
/me fires a muffin from his Muffin Cannon at Sabershy
It is 2:20PM and I'm feeling bored.
Scoot-Scootaloo: Yep :P
Ohai Shizuka :P
Shizuka: maybe asuka is finally just maturing and becoming less hot headed. nah.
Who wants to see the funniest Commercial ever?
11:20pm
Shizuka: 1:20 here also =D
I eats it *Nom nom nom*
00,03MMHMM
11:20
yay yay yay! This video is back! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irQ_d78feMA
11:20 pm
ohai Scoot-Scootaloo. Would you like a muffin?
ok Lunar_Brony i just finished it , want to see?
13hen3ry: nah see in winter she'll idle further down like 40-45, 35 on the best days, but that's because it's bleeding cold inside during winter
Bwhaha
HEY EVERYPONY! THIS DONKEY IS REALLY, REALLY BALD!
00,03I would love one~
13i don't get how it's hot and more humid but she's doing better than a couple weeks ago
cratorkid your OC? Sure
Damn I hate when the chat derps up
i don't like cake.
/me fires a muffin from his Muffin Cannon at Scoot-Scootaloo
wat.
i have no idea what I'm idling at, but... eh. I'd guess humid air would conduct heat a bit better than dry air. Even though it feels worse to humans, to a computer it probably works a bit better.
You don't like cake?
BRACE YOURSELF SCOOTS!
FUNNIEST THING EVER! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuDtACzKGRs
magic ? probably is best to just be happy about it shizu :3
my OC is celestias lost brother DUUUUAAAAAARGHEWERF
I don't like cupcakes. (fic or confection)
AHAHAHHAAH HOT AND HUMID MY ASS IN INDIANA WHERE I LIVE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY RAIN FOR 2 MONTHS
00,03Man down D:
i liek the confection
Would somepony enlighten me as to how to write actions?

Sabershy: use /me acts
Sabershy, type /me
/me
Scoot-Scootaloo oh crap, you alright?
13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i'm going to wake up tomorrow to idling at 65 now aren't i ><
13i'm so bad at not jinxing things
/me is a little rong in the head
/me tries it out...
~yay~ :)
/me coughs up another lung... grr.
/me gives Sabershy chalice of +5 success
higher humidity equals higher heat-conductivity
sooo what about just shutting down for the night ?
A winner is you, Sabershy
das boot
Oh I wouldn't. I can't hold my drinks very well.
Bleeeh
Now I am playing qwop

it puts a muffin in the corner of my screen :3
is it bad that when I found myself in the situation of wanting to sing a lullaby to my niece, I immediately went where you all expect?
hen3ry: hush now quit now
aye
Hush now, quiet now?
hen3ry: no
to be fair, I did not use Sweetie's interpretation. xD
I played that to my mom and she actaully was falling asleep :D
nah, Dan is just that good
xd
hen3ry I sang my little sister "BBBFF" as a lullaby
hen3ry: Better than me. I use Come Little Children.
imw watching ghost rider for the first time and guess what?
Sabershy O_________O
Lunar_Brony: dawwww

n00bninja: Im doing pretty good myself. ;) I had fun out with some friends at an amusement park and now Im relaxing here on bronystate in my bed
Abit of both tbh.

00,10the old ones had no impact tolrence setting
I knew about it but that made me laugh so much for some reason http://i.imgur.com/y8i5X.png
isnt there a limit to how many messages you can send in a row
5 or 6
oh

Only mods are allowed to use color text

No problem,
youll get insta-kicked if you try
Ello there everypony.
hi
00,10I think you left some bits on the pad
hai there Malavolent
its good thing this game doesnt properly model the exhaust
or you would cook those fuel tanks
00,10yet
hai everyone
hey OneTrickPony
00,10and actaly you can cook parts
http://i.imgur.com/Gr0bu.jpg
I would play that
00,10but only in direct path not radient path
yeah, but only in direct
so much
nomnomnom
Pretty epic CrimsonPhoenix
man that is ALOT of fuel still in those tanks
also notice Pinkie Pie
I did :F
* :D
Their hooves look... normal.
00,10terafieing is't it Malavolent
It sure is.
http://thedoghousediaries.com/comics/uncategorized/2012-07-30-bb7597e.png
I like how Twilight and Rarity are the only ones with MP too :P
dat Phase4 stream :3
oni_link: Cause unicorns :D
Unicorn master race.
^
Pffff pegasi reigns supreme
If you could be unicorn, earth pony or pegasus, which one would you pick?
well one could be given energy points or such
^Pegasi
Alicorns
Well if we go RPG rules here its like a weakness triangle
but yeah that is a nice touch
(unicorns || PC == master race) = true
oni_link: How so?
sweetiebot!
00,02stupid thing is too heavy
Pinkies a gypsy yay!
Then I got hit by nostalgia http://i.imgur.com/ktZwz.png
what advanteges would earth ponies have over pegasi or unicorns?
'night Mica
nacht Sumica
Sumica: Only getting a gallery
Night
night Sumica
::
:)
defense
Earth Ponies would have alot of attack/defense/HP. Pegasi would be speedy and Unicorns would have Magic but would be more prone to physical attack.
Pegasus, Offense, Agility, Speed
00,10yeah killerpony7733 it's in said gallery
Sumica: Ooooh
:)
CrimsonPhoenix: Yay, Gotta love being a pegasi
alicorn
Also, I think Earth Ponies would be weak against Pegasi because theyre airborne :D
So basically, Earth ponies win over pegasi, pegasi win over unicorns, unicorns win over earth ponies?
yes
Malavolent: exactamundo
Yay.
Now for MLP MMORPG...
This needs to happen Malavolent :D
hes not seriously gonna go to land with THAT much fuel is he?
Malavolent: Well there is a type of MMORPG in the works
killerpony7733: is there now?
killerpony7733: Legends of Equestria?
Malavolent: Yep, and oni_link what Malavolent said
sweet
It looks kinda nice, but they still have a long way to go.
I'm looking forward to it, though.
i really dislike this mix :P
the constant "boop" sound is getting annoying
I wonder if there will be PvP.
what did I miss
?
pony vs. pony?
ok?
:P\
Mutterguy: Wow.... that's just... perfect.
Mutterguy: lol but yeah :D
Didn't think of this.
oh just Phase4's space program
:O
wait guys, what would their mounts be?? o.o
Humans.
what the balls is going on!!!!!!!!!! :O
Malavolent: oh man :D I lol'd
MOUNTS? bOY WERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEED MOUNTS!!!
*where
Good morning Bronystate! :$
Good morning!
tbh, I think I'd be an earth pony so I can be a tank mwahahah
^
Mutterguy: lmao I just saw that
^_^
The problem with pvp system in pony MMO would be that you are always at advantage while fighting one kind of ponies and you're also weak against one kind of pony.
inb4 phase hits something
Malavolent how on eath is that a problem
THATS MMOs in a nutshell :D
Well, if you play as an earth pony for example, you would be always screwed against unicorns, no matter your equipment and skills.
NERF UNICORNS!!
Which is kinda bad.
and thats what ablity trees would be for!!!
Yeah, it needs some more though before it could be real.
anyone else think the guy in the song is saying back space back back spoace
what you just say 'Grow tree!' and bam squished unicorns?
I don't think that's how earth ponies work.
:P
I think that you should get abilities to close the gap
lolz
is what Im trying to say
What about charge for earth ponies?
And freeze or any kind of snare for unicorns.
actually have either of you read CRISIS equestria? it sort of solves the problem by stating that everypony has some magicial power that's greater then their mere talent, for eample Applejack has geomancy and Pinkie has a stronger 4th wall bending power
Basically WoW ponified.
00,02trying to meet that thing
00,02its 16k away
reverse course?
Malavolent: Ultimately, thats what it should be minus the repetive kill x many of these or collect x many of these formulas
oni_link then there would be no quests
Chrysalis: Well a good game would mask the formula so that its not so in your face.
It'll need lot's of story based quests which WoW does not too badly now.
*do
Oh, story for pony MMO.
What a challenge.
hmm
i wonder if he can get a kerbal into another ship
Malavolent: but where theres a will, theres a way.
We take alll the adventure fanfics and put them in the MMO? with various degrees of trimming? and wiggling
oni_link: Yeah, I'm just saying there is a lot of work to do.
Mutterguy: Yeah that would be the easy way out :D but not a bad a start
Malavolent: Oh ,I know. I think MMOs are the hardest to develop stories and quests for
without being repetitive
this is a rather happy gala mix
So i guess there has to be some sort of conflict? otherwise it'll have run like minecratft
Story: Trixie will get hold of an ultimate artifact and she wants to rule all of Equestria.
Maybe you can choose a faction? Like have it during the times of Nightmare Moon vs Celestia?
woo
NMM > Celestia
o_O
Well, by the end of the next series we'll have more villians to fight
if it no cooperate crash it into the moon
Phase4 whos remix is this?
so it could the Equestria vs the Evil league of...
00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36ds_wnyMW0
thanks
the seven evil exes :D sorry i had to Mutterguy
Speaking of seven, how about the bosses would be seven avatars of deadly sins - elements of disharmony?
...?
http://cheezburger.com/6361769472
Oh my. Just the sight of Pinkie Pie makes my day :)
Malavolent 6 deadly sins. No lust because it's a kid's show :P
Yeah yeah, we know :D
Why not the inverted versions of the elements of harmony
Malavolent: I was thinking just that! Celestia's harmonious army versus the elements of Disharmony
how do you invert magic?
science?
oni_link: Yeah, just like that. And for example, avatar of wrath could be possesed Iron Will. Avatar of Pride possesed Trixie and so on.
Well I know CRISIS Equestria used void energy...
Like honesty's opposite could be deceit and etc.
lyes exactly
Malavolent: makes more sense than mine :D
opposite of luaghter...
oni_link: It would be epic and non cliche.
Crying? :D
:D
Malavolent: You need to write this down for SCIENCE :D
oni_link: I'll keep it in mind, in case the creators of that game would need any ideas. :D
Ear rape?
er hold on you probably need to look at http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-crisis-equestria.html <--- it's an epic read
greed is oviously rarity's opposite
obviously
Malavolent: Seriously, email them! Its a great idea :3
00,02too heavy again
the bass is too heavy too
oni_link: I'll just write it down, I don't even know their email.
Lol okay Malavolent
magic. ...nature..?
I'm making a DnB song...what's a calm word?
peace
liquid DnB*
oni_link: "Legends of Equestria Writers and Voice Actors needed!" Would you look at that :D
thnx Alpha-Omega-Prime
OneTrickPony: tranquility
Your Welcome
Phase4: have you tried reentering Kerban as just a Kerbal yet?
oni_link: srry but I think there are a lot of liquid DnB song named that out there, but thanks anyways
to the thesaurus!!!
^ ^ ^ ^
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, yup
00,02they die
and youre welcome anyways OneTrickPony
aww i must of missed it
Malavolent: If I was any good at VA, I woud so do that!!!
not sure whether to be surprised about that implimantation Phase4
Bucolic
oni_link: Yeah, likewise. It looks like the game is trying to not use any of show's characters, so I guess this is as far as my idea goes.
I need to shave. I'm starting to look like hobo
imperturbation
placidity
Alpha-Omega-Prime: I did, I didnt want to be called a neck beard :P
Phase4: do they die on impact with surface or atmosphere?
00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, surface
serenity!
FIGHT!!!
danke
I don't shave my neck as I don't want a neck beard
i have a question for guys
do you shave your legs
or is that weird
lolno
No but I've done it before. The weirdest feeling ever.
I think only Swimmers do
nope.avi
oh
Shaving legs..haha
Why would you shave your legs for Celestia sake?
:D
00,02lets see if i cant try this again
Alpha-Omega-Prime: Well I get facial hair under my chin but it looks like it goes to my neck
Thanks for making my day abit better Emmie. Too funny ;D
I was curious
Jmo4267 But dont you wanna be smooth :o
here's my WIP/EP http://soundcloud.com/g3nesis-warfare/peace-ep
LOLNOP
I only shave a portion of my chest because I have a portacath that happens to sit next to my nipple and tacky derm pulling on nipple hairs hurt like hell. that's probably TMI
Emmie: I dont care, and girls dont either. Its never put me out of reach :D
XD Mutterguy wat
Mutterguy: haha maybe :P
Not bad
I wish I didn't read that
Mutterguy: What the buck.
bahahahahaha :D

thx;)
00,02then get it back home and play a different game
but the lyrics are hard
XAX there are sooooo many piano covers
XAXpod: that would be bucking awesome though
and even though my boots this fashion is getting old...
woops
shame
Mutterguy: I know some already exist, but hearing it played on stream would be awesome
:)
Phase4: relevant to your descision to shoot for mun landing again instead of trying for minmus http://derpy.me/0K0A8
oooh ok
bucking advertises
lol
NO CHRYSALAIS!!!!!
00,02XD
XAXpod: its the next best thing to being there :)

/me hugs killerpony7733 AdamTheDuck
OH noes, green smoke
hello everypony
^Dat username
Minecraft? lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ynu44LskoA&list=UUy4fgJA93eK0OLkhsZrm1CA&index=1&feature=plcp
hi btw
minecraft: No youtube links during stream
sorry. didnt know
just needed to spread that a little
minecraft: Would that be your channel by anychance?
yeah
anyone know any better places to spread my link?
minecraft: Well you just advertised yourself and that is not a good thing plus youtube links
advertisment is always good
^No unless you asked a mod and there is no stream it is not good
its exactly what i need
Note the I, It says you are are putting it up for selfish reasons
What's the point of trying to get views for a video anyway?
It's like all those people who ask for thumbs up
AdamTheDuck: View whoring really
and people to enjoy my work
minecraft: So?, Don't advertise like a douche and ignore rules
lol that was close
You ask a mod during the time there is no stream, If he or she says ok then by all means
i dont have the time to read all the rules on all the sites i visit. also i have slow crap internet here
there Face*
their face*
i just relised that
i dont rub it in anyones face. how is my work gonna get noticed if i dont tell anyone about it
Grammar nazi and proud of it xD
fuck you
im leaving
minecraft: Oh so you are that important that you got no time to read the ''rules*? My good sir there is always time to read the rules so all you are doing is waltzing in and ignoring all rules
Bye :P
AdamTheDuck: .*
Yay ragequit
Phase4: Got the chat log of that?
Lol forgot my punctuation
00,02?
.*
00,02i'm always logging
Phase4: Ah, Ok hopefully you can make sure he doesn't get back
AdamTheDuck: again .*
00,02ah, minecraft?
/me steals Phase4 computer game Deus Ex and replaces it with Ii.
iji*
00,02with what now?
Phase4: Yeah that guy,
00,02and then i exploded
lol
That plan had genius written all over it
Phase4: wat are you nNittany or something
A indie game that's hard. :P
But interesting
00,02?
00,02ah
Jmo4267: Watched one of cakebuilders videos. They're actually quite funny
Also, Hai Phase4
00,02ohai
hey guys
Hello alexxm
how you doing AdamTheDuck
Oh just fine.
00,02urgh
00,02i cant restart this
Yeah this part is tough
the chat seems pretty empty today
00,02nvm, aparently i can
alexxm: Eeyup around 81 people +AFK'ers etc
how can you check?
so some guy actually linked his own shit in here to advertise it?
Buytoast: Pretty much
how pitiful do you have to be to try and get ponyfags to watch your shit?
Buytoast: Yep, Copy pasted the log and forwarded it to phase
He just waltzed in decided not to read the rules saying he has NO TIME to read them obviously ignoring rules and just going on here for selfish advertisement
did i miss something
alexxm: Just some guy who advertised his youtube channel with a video
huh ok then
i don't care that he did, i'm just more surprised he went to this place out of all the other places he could have gone
Buytoast: Douche's like him usually go everywhere they can go usually like streams etc etc.
00,02how did tong get the package IN there
That's what she said?
:S
My Little Bombs, Explosions are Magic
my little crow vengance is magic
Heya again guys :)
Hello again MaxTheBrony
how you doing MaxTheBrony
Im good , you alexxm ?
i'm good
Hmm, them Fallout Equestria hardcover books do look tempting...
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?
Seems legit.
Also, hi dudes :)
MegaMoonShine: Hiya
Hello MegaMoonShine
GOD THE HEADACHE.
He isn't supposed to be here
Heya MegaMoonShine
Damn, still playing Deus Ex.
Welcome back Jmo4267?
MegaMoonShine They developed it in the 5th century to listen to the mongolan Military Signals
Phase4, you need some food in your system bro.
Wb Jmo4267
i know they do killer, but to come to a brony stream to advertise is like trying to sell AIDS blood to a hospital
Yeah I'm not fully back yet.
Heya Lil_B :)
00,02?
Still building my side-pc.
hi MaxTheBrony :)
Yeah, I guess Phase4 is sort of like our fill-in Nittany, even though he will probably still be streaming after Nittany gets his computer put together. Also, Phase4 doesn't hate playing Magicka as much.
lolmagicka
00,02i might try magicka again
... I have this player that can play SNES (and other systhems) Soundfiles... but these continous and the songs never stops, I have been Listening to "Paranoid" from Rock'n'Roll Racing for 10 min now Oo
Buytoast: It's simple the guy has a one sided view on things, He think he is smart linking it to this place worst is he acts all high and mighty claiming his *TIME* is that important not to read rules and just charge in and advertise for the sole reason to promote his channel
Well, I won't really be available on weekdays as of the next hour.
Damn, my Magicka still doesn't work on the laptop :/
Buytoast: He will hopefully never appear again, Even if he want to as phase will get a mod to ban his host name
Buytoast: Or ban him in general so he can't get here again ever
shit man i get it just saying i pity the guy wasn't expectin the great wall of chatta
To be honest, I'm guilty of some of the things that guy did wrong. When I first came here, it was for the sake of linking a video during a pony episode. But it wasn't my own video, and I had the courtesy to wait until the ending credits before I posted the link.
/me feels strange for actually reading the rules before watching stream xD
for the first time I mean.
As for why he didn't read the rules, who here reads the full text of every EULA of every non-GPL program they install on their system?
hey guysss
AdamTheDuck, that's good of you to do that. Thanks.
Hey Emmie.
Hello Emmie
hey Emmie :)
btw guys, anyone want their oc drawn?
I'm bored and I have my tablet out. ^^
Emmie: Sure
Killerpony7733 ref pleeasE?
Emmie: I can give you my OC details in PM
kk
pictures are preferred though :<
I thought that too the first time I came here
I guess he's seen enough site rules to figure that they're all the same.
Ah I still remember watching from BronyState for the first time and watching Phase4 massacre all the kerbal. :D
Best first impression ever
00,02xd
00,02XD'
The first time I came here I was watching superb64 playing Rythm Heaven
00,02i thought there was more to this mission
00,02but nope
00,02desk is right here
I was like "Dude, oh it's this game from the pony animations!"
Since we do have nuanced rules here, maybe we should make it clear to newcomers that the rules really SHOULD be looked at and not just assumed to be the same old same old.
Oooooh, that's gotta hurt!
if people assume they are above them, its their own fault
Dark_Horst: Exactly, The guys reason for not reading them was that he said *HIS TIME* was more important that he didn't want to use it on reading rules
MORNING EVERYPONY :)
00,02i love these pocket secretary messages
Mornin' Ponies47
If ponies could talk wouldn't that make them super intelligent creatures?
MASF123: And Ponyville is a nudist collony, your point is? :P
brb
MORNING Ponies47 :)
MASF123: so what would you consider as 'talking'?
Guys, if you kept reading the same exact same thing over and over again every time you started using a site, would that not be a waste of your time?
I'm not saying that he was in the right. I'm just saying that I understand where he's coming from.
Kandarihu: Either way, In the end you can't think that cause you are only making yourself look like a fool
Kandarihu: I haven't seen any community where shameless self-advertising isn't considered negative..
back
shana, speaking in syllables of any language.
MASF123: ok now it boils down to what language is. all living things have some sort of communication
AdamTheDuck I wasn't trying to prove anything, I was merely just asking a question hoping someone would answer it
MASF123: you could consider DNA as a language..
Sorry, my response was suppose to be a joke... :S
holy crap you people are still debating this whole advertisement deal?
shana good point even ants communicate with their feelers.
Buytoast: How long has it been going on for?
nearly forty minutes or somethin
What's all this talk about communication now?
Buytoast: I guess they are, :D
communication is an interesting topic
The Hub is having a mini marathon of PONIES, So if ping me if ya need me :P
But everypony the guy came in acted like a douche and he was only here to advertise and he broke two rules with a full on awareness of it, And he will most likely be banned
or maybe you should shut up woman >: (
*Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends?*
Yes. I suppose that he had better places to advertise his Youtube channel. If it's Pony related, somehow, that might be why he chose to advertise it here. And not having the patience to read the rules, felt justified to plug his stuff.
if there was hub in german,y that might actually be interesting
wonder what episodes they're showing
Y I no have Hub?! :(
/me wishes he could afford paid tv. :/
Damn you, Sky!!!
why does england not have the hub
FALCON PUNCH
God, these guards are stupid
who fools for that
"I'm in the doorway. There's noone here, let's move on. Doobeobodoo!"
Kandarihu: Oh uh right, It wasn't even pony related actually. Nearly forgot to say that it was pretty much the new beta update for minecraft
Kandarihu: He had no videos that match pony related content so yep
Ah, I see. You visited his link so that the rest of us don't have to.
Kandarihu: He is also getting more thumbs down then ups so he is not just advertising it here
I see. So he got his just deserts.
hello everypony
Kandarihu: Oh god what he has a DA and turns out he knows someone from here and it's all back from may
Kandarihu: So he has been here before.
ti russkii ???
hi killerpony7733 Kandarihu and deadxak
No excuse, then, NOW he has no excuse.
CCCP: Hiya :3

Hello CCCP
Kandarihu: Yep, I'm really scratching my head now

Kandarihu: Oh god what. He is a brony? seriously i'm losing all respect of the guy

After this can you stream the MLP marathon? Plz.
Derpy123:is there one on the hub right now?

Hello i'm back from turkey

hi RaveBrony and GreeHetBronyInDuitsl
Hello RaveBrony
00,02ohai RaveBrony
MASF123: Oh. Still i doubt it's going to get streamed
Hey RaveBrony :)
/me waves to AdamTheDuck, CCCP, and Phase4
MASF123: Remember we aren't ponies 24/7 :D
/me waves to MegaMoonShine :$
whos streaming?
...maybe I should go check the Brony Network for the marathon
hello RaveBrony
00,02dats enough deus ex for now
Phase4 i saw a movie called phase4 in a swiss movie store
Hiya Texasboykc09 :P
Yeah but this would be a special occasion.
i see phase4s streaming XD
He is just ending his stream yes
There is an MLP marathon going on right now.
I was bored to death in a turkish village because they had no internet there
On The Hub.
oh boy
I do not have The Hub.
Allo everypony.
Hello Meanwhile
Me neither
So I've heard, MidnightWonko
is Math neccessary?
good god
I had hoped this site would rectify that issue, as it has in the past for new eps.
hello Meanwhile
MidnightWonko: We know, And it's most likely not gonna get streamed since again the site isn't ponies 24/7 :D
hi Meanwhile
Awwwwww.
:(
MidnightWonko:get the cimtel cable box and connect it to the internet the hub will be on there
Allo Meanwhile :)
What exactly have I stumbled blindly into. Because it looks like Algebra.
No math isn't neccesary
KERBALS!
00,02KERBALS
00,02: D
Ever have the suspicion you were being watched? :O
SLABREK
00,02algebra should be taught
i see you have virtual box phase
The Phase4 pony has been doubled.
you should show it XD
00,02it takes a while to get it, and if you dont learn it early you wont
00,02lol double phase
What does it mean?!
00,02i thought i started phasepony, but he went missing
00,02so i started another
For me,math is like toxic (With that,i mean boring)
00,02^
00,02that
For that cable box that connects to the Internet and has cable, you have to pay monthly yes?
Phase4:wanna stream yourself on virtual box?
00,02is the fault of the teacher
Math is a game!! You cant let the numbers win :)
00,02sonicandmario85, nah
It's trendy to blame teachers.
I suck at math...and just about anything else in life.
i have virtual box too xD
I should have been asleep half an hour ago but can't from that horrific scene.
Still wondering when I would want to find a third side of a right angle triangle in everyday life...
Sometimes, the student is to blame for not applying himself.
00,02^ is allso true
i put ubuntu on it
00,02but the teacher is not immune to blame
00,02i use virtualbox to boot my linux install
No one has such immunity.
00,02^
I blame Phase4.
00,02anyone here got magicka
00,02Meanwhile, :<
So do I, Meanwhile.
i use it to go on diffrent operating systems XD
Hmmm....he appears to get the chat coming in late...oh no wait, that's the stream goign slow for me, I need to refresh.
I have Magicka. Haven't played it in forever though.
I use ssh to go into different operating systems :)
Phase4: Sadly nope, If i could get a copy of it now i would install quick and play with ya :(
00,02i'ma start up a magicka game
Magicka doesn't work on my laptop :'(
00,02shana, o u :)
/me 00,02hugs shana
There's just one combination of elements you need to know for Magicka...
/me hugs Phase4 back
I was so close to being in a hospital bed right now... Bloody hell.
:o
Water, Cold, Water, Cold, Thunder, Arcane, Shield.
TheRandomkid321: Why? :o
00,02Midnight_Stormwing, Lightning bolt
did I miss a discussion about maths :/
All you need to know for Magicka is arcane mines.
TheRandomkid321: What's wrong?
When used, it creates a barricade of deadly electric ice that kills anything stupid enough to walk into it.
00,02derp ping
<_< >_>
For the undead, replace arcane with life, of course.
00,02steam things i need more direct x
ALL the direct x.
I hated algebra in my college years - 2 of my professors were new to the US - got their teaching job at my community college, had such heavy accents and poor English I couldnt understand them
uh...
For single mobs, cast on sword instead of force cast.
TheRandomkid321:is it because they thought your crazy or something?
00,02i'm doing calculus
00,02engineering mathmatics1
Well, I'm off.
RaveBrony and everyone else I wont repeat it again. I was walking across the road outside of school. A bunch of cars whee lined up so noone could see the other lane. I started walking slowly across and another kid ran right past me and got hit by a speeding car. I aint even sure if the kid is still alaive but the ambulance station was just down the street.
Good luck on Magicka!
Night MidnightWonko
TheRandomkid321, that must have been one hell of a morning.
Phase4: neat, so you're going after an engineering degree?
MASF123 afternoon actually
What is this game
00,02shana, yup
does anypony know how to enter the lottery
00,02electronics and electrical
So he got hit after lunch?

GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: magicka
Texasboykc09: Sign up for the newsletter.
MASF123 after school
Magicka, whatever it's called. __-
Had 1 professor that never showed up on time - an hour late on a few occasions - :| never did get a refund for that class, nor was the professor fired
Is that game brutal? I would love to know
Kerbals irl Phase4.
00,02this is multiplayer
00,02^ Meanwhile
when his class time was almost over, he'd decide to show up
Dat command prompt
00,02ip: 118.209.247.154
O.o
Dat ip Address
00,02i like how its quicker to ssh into a linux machine than mess with the windows native dns resolver
Dat copy and paste
00,02password is Ponies
Sorry I'll stop.
00,02join magicka : D
Is the game scary
Lol. Ponies.
I dont have it :(
00,02GreeHetBronyInDuitsl, nope
Phase4: you should try the game Kohctpyktop, it actually "teaches" lots of EE basics :)
Oh ok
00,02i've been through 2 years of tafe already :P
Phase4: (as in circuit design elements, flip flips, logic gates, etc)
is there a offical bronystate minecraft server?
FUDGE.
00,02sonicandmario85, no :(
00,02i'm looking at getting one
Fudge nuggets
Phase4:yea there should be
BUILDING OLD COMPUTERS IS A PAIN IN THE ARSE.
Lol!!! Am i Pink on your chat, Phase4?? xD
/me Has never played Minecraft :$
00,02RaveBrony, yup
sonicandmario85: We do have official ish, SB64 has one and wrek, But they are up when they are awake and go down when they are sleeping usually
00,02dat Meanwhile
going to get lunch
Insufferable interface.
Omg :D
I played the demo for KH: Dream Drop distance. It is kind of fun anyone planning on getting it?
alexxm: Bring me something! :$
00,02shana, you done much electronics?
please?
What was the question asked when they decided how to make this? "How can we make multiplayer games as difficult as possible to join?"
Anybody get one of those professors that tell you right at the start of the semester "xx% of you will not pass this class* and absolutely refuse to explain something you dont understand? Why the heck teach in the first place
Pinkie Pie? Lol.
Pinkie Pie is cool :3
00,02need more players
Sorry Phase4 don't have the game :/
LOL
Ponies47:you should buy minecraft its fun also watch lets plays of it on youtube and you will know what to do in it
Phase4: some, more high level stuff as in how cpu works. Implemented a cpu in verilog on a FPGA and so on. Also have an arduino and to experiment and stuff
It is great
Ponies47:i didnt buy it though i got a cracked version
00,02shana, i've done that plus some of the lower level analog stuff
I forsee much lag in my future.
00,02vhdl is bizare
Phase4: I am near a computer science bachelor
00,02Meanwhile, that you do
sonicandmario85: It's 20 bucker dollars! :[
Ah well, in that case, watch out for freezing boulders.
crap this tag looks ugly... :/
Phase4: verilog syntax is much, much nicer :)
Tough i don't need to play minecraft
*bucking
00,021st year uni for me so not so close to my degree
00,02shana, i've heard that bug i'd be buggered if i could find good info on the internet
Hey.
Mother of Celestia my Eyes are tired ~.~ gonna get some coffee and then draw a bit until i feel so tired to sleep fine, so gn8 everypony see ya :D
So wuts next?
What we watching nexT?
Fou_Lou: yeah thats what i said a short while earlier, its possible. but like i said, wouldve been hard for him to rule alone anyway, he would have nobody to kill the jedis for him
Ohai.
So what have we learned, everypony..........was this movie about ''PEACE''? No...............IT WaS ABOUT TWO HOURS OF FILLER!!
Kandarihu: I'm tempted to make images of it now. :|
do i hear Harry Potter music?
Gosh, I've been here since 30 minutes before Robocop... I even forgot what that movie was aboout! :O
......surrounded by an epic lightsaber battle with Darth Maul in it!!!!
its ... okay.. if you block out Jar jar, dont mind the huge plot holes
PinkePieYoshi likewise
:P
twilight_sprinkle: the kedis where outlaws at the end anyway. even when they are jedis they cant fight against a whole empire without any support
Well, it's 4:30AM and I'm knackered.
G'night everypony.
My Luna.........ONE MOVIE DOWN..............TWO MORE TO GO
CriticKitten, might as well make parodies of Mayor Bloomberg too. "Big Gulp Sodas aren't illegal." "I can make them illegal."
Night, Meanwhile
take care Meanwhile
Good night Meanwhile!
Wait more movies?
Bloomberg already IS a parody
are we watching episode 2?
http://www.flickr.com/photos/83912318@N06/7681627796/in/photostream
Who is streaming next?
i'm not sure i can do that...
I think that's tomorrow
Fou_Lou: the clones wouldnt have been able to take the academy without a sith on their side though, especially a stih who was trusted by the jedi
Tomorrow the prequel that's even worse. Join us for another good old chat riffing tomorrow when Episode II plays!
sure, give star wars 4/10 but give that cliche zombie ripoff of Shaun of the dead 9/10 :\
Kandarihu: inb4 I make template. :3
13wut
13that disclaimer
13that's funny
What you streaming next?

Shizuka, can you stream the top 11 of Dumbasses in distress? (Nostalgia Critic) ............if that's OK with you
Hear that
AWW SHIT FORESHADOW

Oh well, Night everypony---- and many thanks for the streams :)
we should watch gunslinger girl
twilight_sprinkle: I think without anakin it would have been harder but not impossible. They just could have bombed the temple down with tanks and stuff
schoolgirls with desert eagles... yep its anime time
13Dark92Enigma: star wars kicked off the whole THX thing, at the very end there it was like "if you have experienced problems because of this movie, call 1-800-PHONE-THX
13deerp
someone hsould call it
13need to keep my list updated...
*should
OH THAT ONE........i thought i missed something else ABOVE IT.....Shzuka

Fou_Lou: yeah but anakin was scertainly a huge part of his domination. hard to say if he couldve pulled it off w/o him
um what?

Too bad Shizuka has lag issues streaming right off of YouTube or she'd show that new Derpy Cardcaptor ending. Ah well Sumica can save that to show after Movie Night

Sumica it was in that new EqD post dari posted just a little bit ago

otakon: I call.

NO
otakon: and that gives me an idea. bronystate should do a poker night
Ask Shizuka
looks more like engrish to me
twilight_sprinkle: can be do online poker?
twilight_sprinkle: and could someone stream it?
Quick_Thinker: it's the middle episode of Angel Beats. She's trying to hack into the villain's computer and find out more about what's going on.
...?
otakon: well there are various ways to play poker. as for streaming , we need to ask le mods
well, not exactly a villain, she just gets in the way.
she reminds me of myself i talk to myself way to often
Is there a stream?
otakon: simplest way would probably be fb poker, but there are other ways
yes
what is this?
angel beats
goddamn this show is confusing
wats it about
Better click refresh then
Garretbrony: Angel Beats, read the wiki we're Media Res here

IT's a TRAP
Shizuka: okay WHAT ist he appeal of this show? WHAT is it?
13you'll see
random anime ftw!
Garretbrony: it's a confusing concept for one and I was introduced in the middle of it
Per-ception
It's basically the ghosts of dead teenagers rebelling against God
I'm not sleeping anytime soon - tonight was a night of creepypasta stories
Their voices are starting to grow on me
