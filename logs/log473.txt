This reminds me of those levels in Ratchet in Clank.
ait was only so we had a free place to stay at for tournaments in greenbay
Hiya
alexxm: personally I find portal 2 lacking because the co-op is really the only challenging part of the game. the single player is really all about the story and not the puzzles
hai RainbowAsh
how did they come up for the planets in this game
One of my favorite games right here
Hi CCCP

ShiningArmor: You just put # and then the name that you want.
Aside from the obvious flirtation that he wants to engage in with you.

Is there actually someone streaming?

Saxy, that seems to be a bit more difficult than my standards.:D
I don't sunbathe, I actually hate it
i think it's because shizu can use the voice command better on l4d1
03don't know many guys who do that
2Guess I'll have to move to a different country
haha TheRainbowDash knows who drinks a lot ^^
Castlevania difficulty is worst difficulty.
I only did it cuz it was literally painful how white I was under my arms
I personally liked L4d1

Jackie Chan was jealous when the first Karate Kid came out in '86. He said he had a similar plot in his head at the time. Funny how things work out.
Y U China and not Japan? Karate not from China, Karate from Japan.

I hope you guys don't mind that i picked the remake. I had just seen it, and i love the original, but I know a lot of people haven't seen it cause they think it will just a be a shitty reboot.
WallDives: I've had mine, thank you. :)
Mr.Han is watching the kid while not listening to the woman :P
What were they thinking when they decided to make this movie. They put it in China and not Japan, and they made it kung-fu instead of karate, but still kept the name Karate Kid, its unfaithful bullshit, bullshit I tell ya, bullshit

StinkomanFan besides, they set it in China instead of Japan or California, and instead of karate they have him do kung-fu and still name it The KArate Kid instead of The Kung-Fu Kid, thats pretty unfaithful to me

Hello FlareChaser.
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Flying Dragons use a variation of the "No Mercy" chant from the original as their own motto.
JackIsh_Chan: no i mean the actor whom played him?
FlareChaser: you never left.
Miyagi wasn't Mako
05,15TheXIIILightning but...that's a Sifu. so maybe it's okay

RainBroDash, you are a man who frequently masturbates in a rather compulsive and vulgar fashion.
sages: They DO look like Cobra troops.
rape kids? O_oi

There was a road in between the market and the academy, but the cut it out for time restraints

Now we need Dre to be picked as a member of Battle Royal. Then we can have a VERY interesting movie...
i r protagonist!
FlareChaser: how do you sleep alone...

Oh yeah, China is so awful, with its history and culture and girl you'll probably end up boning.
I wonder if Jaden players will discover new tech to be able to beat Pole?
Cry some more!
00,10they never said
05,15WE...don't know why the moved to China

kirzstryfe: I think it ws for her job
He IS in the film! Jackie Chan plays him!
1,11It's surprising how much like Will Smight Jaden actually acts in this movie. It's like he's literally a mini Will.
kirzstryfe: they sorta simply moved
kirzstryfe i'm guessing the mom got a job there
1,11Smith
04Fun fact
Why WOULD you move to China?
3Because China's bitchin' yo
fluttercry: Because ghettos suck?
he gets beat up more in the uncut version
00,10Get Dre a pony/
1,11Smight. XD

That's why they moved. Because they originally lived in Detroit.

To be fair, we usually do not pay as high taxes even now as nations with nationalized health care.

Oooh snap a S*yay*t storms a brewing around my place

Waaaait a second.. I got a ping from wrek... :O
otakon: wat
StinkomanFan: no. not my littlekuriboh. with the abridger guy
Houston's got a scale replica of the Forbidden Temple, as well as a replica Terricota Warrior field
WHY IS HE NOT WEARING HIS UNIFORM?
There's only one thing with this version
so much orange
otakon: ScootaChicken went to China?! That lucky...
Silverscreen: maybe hes a kid version from the villain of Kung fu Hustle
I know, just cracking a joke
The bullying makes more sense with the kids being middle schoolers.
ScootaChicken: how was your trip to China last year?
Applejack's country
And FlareChaser died that day due to be excited
SunderlandPony89: It was pretty shit, although bitches fucking love me there.
FlareChaser that pings makes you a rich man
this is a really bad idea on dre's part
I've been fascinated with it since I saw the movie The Last Emperor (excellent movie btw)
ScootaChicken goes everywhere

RX-78-SweetieBot: FUCK OFF
WANKER
Inc!
00,10is he stupid?
In the original, the kid has to surpass his peers, in his teenage years. And in those years teenage pressure is a much stronger issue. In this one, it's elementary kids. The problems end with just telling the teacher or so
the freakin psycoath kids
Deadlypon3: so he cant affor a box?:3
Solid Negro

I will say this, since I should say what I want to say: I don't like it here in the USA much. I think our society is at the core very evil. I mostly live here because I can scratch out a half-decent existence honing my skills, though I honestly wonder why I bother. I think the USA will become a third-world nation in the next generation.

Hoah
How to defeat them without actually hurting them.
Unrealistic I think. In China kids are taught to respect their elders. I doubt they would attack him
It was cooler with Mr Miyagi
it seems
FF!
the original didn't need slomo to be awesome

Chinese gorillaz? Pandaz?
Well kids, Imma go to Sweden now...

He assumed everyone in China knows Kung Fu
Funnily enough a lot of chinese schools teach martial arts as a kind of equivalent to gym class. But I doubt this movie knew that.

Shit, I need to learn Japanese...
StinkomanFan: Only because of those damn giant mutated bee enemies. Those things were a major reason why I ragequited the game
next fallout should be somewhere still on the east side of the US, and not too far from DC so the events from Fallout 3 can have their effects shown
i know that
You don't say?

What an awkward dumbass kid who doesnt know how to shut his mouth!
00,10so is that guy stalking them or is that thing a taxi?
CloverMuffins: Very, lol.
wat
3there's a reason for it, CupcakeWarrior, it has to do with my real name: Sebastian Moon Lowrey, then Sebastian Lowrey Moon > S Lowrey Moon > SlowreyMoon > SlurryMoon. It's my name slurred together.
04You're like a mini Will Smith, and Jackie Chan is teaching you because he has nothing better to do on a Tuesday
damn nice country side
its a taxi
so, a bad voice actor, Crippler
DeathStar, you see it mirrored
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is best star wars
Um, the Force is an interconnectedness between all living things. And in Dre's analogy, he'd be a padawan.
goddamn I'll be honest I WANT one of those little cart things

00,10I see pixles
Ffff...
IS NO ONE STUNNED BY THE SNAKE THERE?
wow high up
1,11RANDOME MOVIE TRIVIA: The style of Kung Fu that the female snake charmer is practicing is Crane Style Kung Fu. Practitioners of this style are very adept at balancing on one foot, as a crane does. It is interesting to note that she is controlling a cobra. This is another nod to the original The Karate Kid in which Daniel defeated a member of the Cobra Kai dojo by using the Crane
1,11technique.
Oh damn... i would never
05please tell me the B movie for tonight is kung pao, enter the fist

She is sure charming that snake
00,10shame it's not wrek

Oh god, I hope so Wrek

And here, Dre's going to learn how to shoot his Chi in the form of energy beams. As silly as it might sound, he PIRATED MUSIC without getting attacked by the police. It's fantasy already.
