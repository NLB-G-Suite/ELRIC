/me 4grabs his crotch
Now I get it
6<.>
/me 13sobs, "Oh Celestia, I can't even wink out of the room anymore, I'm /useless/." She rolls on the ground wallowing in...in...whatever it is ponies wallow in.
nice
4why?....
*starts humming equestria girls*
13:|
Wait
/me 13pokerfacew
If he's the only good singer, I guess he's actually already the winer.
/me pokerfaces
Synchtube is trrbl. Always dropping connection.
How can it be a contest with only one pony?
/me 4falls to the floor in the fetal position
/me okay.jpg faces.
13So much pokerface
Hurray for Roberto!
Seems working fine for me give it some time
5because...
ATTEMPT 4
Stars off pretty slow at first
/me pulls away a bit later, simply breathing hard and staring at Silvermane. "You...."
Yes.
/me absconds to his corner
She is.
wow random disconnect
13Ick.
/me calls Pinkie Pie.
Pinkie Pie: Hello?
6D:
Fantastic
!seen DerpyBot
Look into my eyes.. 6_9
It works fine, then just quits.
/me says "Time to throw a party."

/me is totally not afraid of seeing the interview images on his photobucket <.< >.>
Aw.
Woo!
/me 4gets up
/me huffs. "What do you have to say for yourself?"
(Timeout)

/me looked back at Metal RPing
4why am i even going to try this again?
(Roleplay Timeout)
that reminds me
I watch it for the plot
6NOPE.avi!
Pony slang for BUTTS.
It's..
I had to make a bunch of plots in matlab today
Wierd.
goddamn it was hard
lol
matlab is horrible
lol
it is
(Roleplay Timein)
07soooo you want a newsletter?
/me turns to glare at DecapKing. "Rrr..."
15DecapKing, leave her be please
I don't even know how you could make a decent-looking plot using matlab.
07I can send one if you wish
yes, you know it's gonna be alright
Yeah, but they're quiet.
(please tell me you got the reference)
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
/me 4steps back
plot(x,x+1)
6If it is from you yes! :DD
there that's a plot
!muffinkiss
07yes yes )
/me huffs, turns back to Silvermane, suddenly quiet.
6I. . . . I think I might Val. . .
Maybe somebody needs to get them all to make some NOISE!
/me is content now :P
/me 13flies out the window, sobbing softly. "Oh, I had no idea..." She flaps wobbily and disappears into the night.
!flip
Well, they're just speechless after that performance
Oh.
plot is a math thing
GRRM, I mean literally. Plot = butt.
15Dammit Tink...
Cya.
plot is also pony slang for butt
!link plot macro
We can continue this tomorrow

Yep.
Cheers to the first and only person to win the contest and a good singer!
Cheers.
Trying to make plots (pony butts) in matlab
13Last time we talked about the Newsletter <3
ponies are awesome
Person? What's that?
but as for improvements
Roberto.
Defining Person, Roberto.
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4839
/me points to idea thread he made today
User_4389: PFFT Ponies are gay grr I like FOOTBALL!
Oh ok
Yeah... streaming is a no go until I can get the NST to look at my connection.
Wh..
also Sathi, if you want me to handle the emails I'll more than happily do that for you
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4839
(That wasn't in the program >_<)
No, he's a pony.
dammit
Well of course
He's standing right over there
I was about to ask you guys
and for that moment I was extremely awesome
/me ears lower as she listens, nodding dumbly. "Oh... I... I see."
07e-mails is fine i'm more concerned about the looks of our newsletter
why do you call horsebutts plot?
Never heard of that race before...
13Hmmm... graphic designing...
I think the correct show-established term is flank
You know, I have zero idea.
hmmm
13Whats it look like right now?
Gorge_RR_Martin, idk
I dunno where plot came from
oh
Well, but we're ponies. We can do whatever we want.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/list/plot macro/1 might hold the answer
I don't know.
well, we could always make a little border image for it
like with some Pony gifs and whatnot
*After Pinkie's Party*
/me takes off after MirthTinker.
I'm not sure how emails imbed those images into the text
D:
/me goes home.
/me runs
07hang on sending you all the old one
13Haha. XD
that was my other name
Been fun, we should do it again sometime!
4you got this DE?
yep

Uh......
From another time.
Cya guyz.
Okay, night.

'Night everypony.
(PST?)
See ya tomorrow!
Been fun.
Later
CDT.
15(inb4 vodka)
Central Daylight Time like the time in texas.
Okay then, see ya
/me 4goes off towards the town hospital
/me begins to gain on MirthTinker, being a more experienced flier.
K bye!
13I was going to volunteer to perhaps help with the design as well. lol
oh
/me blinks, then sighs and flies off, landing gracefully on the ground.
(So...we still roleplaying?)
oh
/me shrugs
wings are always the same color as the main part of the pony
oh
!link asdf_movie
(Brb)
6Dat grass~
but they're cartoon ponies
(K, I guess that's it for roleplaying)
/me 4starts to come back to the apartment, nearly just as soon as he left it
07u has mail?
It's like you're killing me slowly
With this book
with this book
Well, with that out of the way, who's ready for Season 2?!
another 5 years until Winds of Winter comes out
>>
15Not saying anything about how interested I would or wouldn't be in you, but it isn't fair to her. (dammit you have no idea how hard it is to turn down f***ing Fluttershy of all ponies)
6I does has mail!! O:
4what kind of fucking hospital closes?
07zomg
4DONE
wow FimFiction slooks 120% cooler
and I'll probably die before A Dream of Spring comes out
but yeah, I'm thinking border image
Magic
Ouch, guess no-one...
Pinkie Pie bends reality, remember
Oooh right
batteries?
I mean
Slow down Mirth!
image*
She MOVED that one wipe
13Ah, okay.
TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
with different characters as the theme
She stole the dying sun of a tiny star system.
13I want to make it all pretty now. <3
Pinkie Pie bends reality
and maths
6Hold on, figuring out embeds.
6Yus!! <3
13I don't know how! *Sniff* Silvermane did this to me damnit!
in fact...the boxes could be REALLY easy to make
and the 4th wall
And meth.
Lots and lots of meth
And has inflatable hair.
/me raises a hand
/me pulls her wings to her side with the same slowness, her eyes wet. "I... I understand..."
all I'd need is a vector image of each of the mane ponies and I could whip them out lickety split
(oh really? that hard? o-o)
Back
And forgot to take her meds that one day.
!plot
Pinkie Pie is <3
there is no 4th wall
/me 4goes into the bathroom
*wigglewiggle*
07DA > vector images :)
(*eats popcorn*)
4well this is going to suck
I figured as much :P
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
/me giggles
Pinkie Pie obliterated it
/me 13hits the side of a building with a thud
wait wut?
Pinkie Pie killed virtual polar bears?!
/me pulls up
Oh you know
Fox News
Shit shit shit
Pinkie Pie did that too
lol
oh
I'm just watching people RP
Oop wait a second
!plot
lol
*wigglewiggle*
:3
/me 4comes back out of the bathroom
/me 13slides down the wall, motionless
You probably don't know this. But PINKIE PIE IS ALSO BEHIND YOU!
15(oooo that's gotta hurt)
/me flys down to catch MirthTinker
!link plot
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/13188
Which is why
XD
alright, gimme some time while I crank something out really fast
Not PINKIE
But Pinkamena
/me turns to look at Silvermane with her wide, sad eyes, lip trembling. "I... I should probably never come back, should I...?"
/me scrounges for his tablet
/me 4jumps back at the sight of Fluttershy
/me grabs onto her, then begins to slowly lower her to the ground.
Fox News isn't a credited source for papers in most classes at my school.
Pinkamena's crazy enough to kill people with Deadpool.
nope.jpg
and then yellow their journalism more than Fluttershy's flank
YOU HEARD THE LADY. SHE AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERES, CHUMP.
/me 13is also working on her own version
/me is working on some too
I'd watch an episode or two, but only when I was desperate enough that the plot (and I mean the storyline) seemed interesting
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE!
6Well. . . Not vector or whatever. . .
13;)
9(oki)
Superman, Superman... Shh..... You hear that? Do you hear the Justice League?
i wish i were RD there
15(that works)
I didn't have much against it aside from finding it boring.
Jack Thompson
8YELLOW IS MIEN HAHAHAOOOOOHOOOHA
I wouldn't even bother with it
Also, Pinkie's shoulders move.
HaysforPonies the Mass Effect thing blown out of proportion. That one.
4uh, sorry for interrupting, but is she going to kick me again?
I can't stand it
15... >.>
Just all over the place.
5okay, not really
Oh and the toys
/me shudders
No Faust-Awesome-Spray, no deal
/me 9sniffles. "B-but that implies that I'm yours... and... I'm not..."
dat plot
/me reachs the ground with MirthTinker in tow.
/me 14absconds
STUPID INTARWEBZ
Uhhh...until the battery dies? >.>
Yea cuz zipper humping....
How can I work without my music playing FLUIDLY!
>>
I"m just going to leave it at that
brb though.
/me 13is limp, but breathing, albeit heavily from pain and overexertion
...
HIYA HaysforPonies
oooohh
Efreet?
Years later, Fox News hates on Bulletstorm for its immaturity, but is unaware of Shadows of the Damned which contains some same immaturity
/me 15sighs. "Right, right... look, umm... oh dear."
The toys today are still a problem
Darnit
I got rr'd
FOX5 news=fail
nuff said
Selective outrage is a thing.
Gotta remember the studio that makes this show is a TOY COMPANY
neat
They wanna sell TOYS
lolwut
Hah.
o.O
I know right? I kept sending him emails saying "Don't fuck up Mass Effect" as a joke
/me takes out his flask and pours a little down MirthTinker's throat.
Wow equestria is a country lol
It's sooo hot.... -_-
Today's toys are okay.
They really fucked that one up good lol
/me 13coughs instinctively, but makes no other movement
/me takes some bandages from his saddlebags.
Haven't played bulletstorm. But that kicking animation looks pretty sick
Keyframe, tell him "Don't fuck up BF3. Remember MoH."
I don't think TruTV had a say in the matter...
next episode is "the best night ever":
>_<
No, Toys R Us
!link http://www.synchtube.com/r/IsaacShark#
:P
/me feels his laptop. "Oh that's why."
Before, I feel I could find more than a few people that found G1 toys some kind of nightmare_fuel.
5So Fluttershy, have you guessed my doppelganger yet?
/me begins wrapping MirthTinker's bruises and cuts in bandage.
They are
I would totally buy a show-accurate set of Mane 6 + Princesses
/me 9shrinks a little lower to the ground, but looks over her shoulder at Silvermane, biting her lip.
a pretty good waste
Dude
GIRLS thought it was nightmare_fuel
Uh... yea. Night all
if you're going to play it. I'd advice piratin git
gnight frame
Haha, not younger girls
/me finishes bandaging MirthTinker. Then lays her over his back.
4Silver, i would watch out around her
Not at someone else's house
4she kicks HARD
9oh dear.. 3somes... =_=; )
13(it was just the once, and she was brainwashed!)
and of course the screen would reject it
But come on, how many times have people poked at girls using references like My Little Pony or Barbie?!
/me begins walking back towards the house.
in my room
okay, I have a REALLY rough draft
15(Tinker was the brainwasher in that story...)
4also
psh, normaly my screen doesn't :D
uploading it to photobucket now
They'd get princesses or barbies.
it usually makes good choices
4please dont kick me again Fluttershy
/me 14absconds
Evening...and brownies are food...
hi
Oh fuck yes
althought the release wasn't as intended
/me 9shakes her head suddenly, shuddering. "I can't believe you... you made me think that you loved me like that when you didn't!"
Damn, walked into that one
*facehoof*
/me 13is still unconscious, lying on DE's back and breathing erratically
Lol
but they're animated and drawn to look like teenagers
Ahoy
Uh
34.
Hate not being able to fly...
chasing underage girls
o.O
dang...
Yeah
I just got to level 21 D:
yar
/me 15hangs his head, wings drooping at his sides. "And I'm sorry for that. I didn't intend to mislead you."
okay
lol
Like
Straight.
/me continues the trek back.
we can clump every subject into these colored boxes
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Temp.jpg
for 48 hours!?
Is it now?
We slept.
XD
:P
>2011
and buy it
>using Bing
and kick zombies in the face!
well I could put the eyes back
just I figured the full image would draw too much attention
I'd assume it's the same as the console systems
you mean with keyboard and mosue?
mouse*
With digital/analog fighting options?
Well, maybe after classes...
yeah
Interesting
thoughts?
it's not that bad
/me 4drops to the floor when he hears the crying
It got to the point that using analog was just too slow.
hey HotCocoa
How many creatures should a typical MTG deck have
4Finished "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" for the first time. It's been a long time coming
Later in the 20s.
Hey
got any marshmellows :3?
that sucks
cuz I'm running a lot of burn cards
6DDDDD: AAAAAAHHHH!!!
lol
Could be worse, thoug.
yep
Yeah, it could rain
Could be food poisoning. Try going to classes with that~
/me 9trembles, shaking her head and leaning down, curling up into a ball.
Hello.
Then you'd be ****ed
hiya
Exactly!
BUT
Ah...fuck...who locked this thing?
ScratchSweater is daaaaw
14(got to go)
As a Kart racer...that way I know it couldn't suck that bad

:O?
This drawfriend helped me realize that...that...Luna is not best pony.
Night everypony!
but yeah
There's a bunch in development by fans.
There's also the SMB2 sprite hack
if the image distracts too much from the text
night herospirit
You mispelled Twilight
Later
Night herospirit
making the text stand out
How long did it take to reach that conclusion?
I used to use Gamespy back in the day to look up Quake and Quake Team Fortress servers lol
Night hero

WE ALL MISSPELLED FLUTTERSHY EXCUSE ME
AHEM
Watch it man!
Harumph.

Yeah lol
07I say to the forums with all idea's
I get it
6And we could have the boxes not just vertical, but maybe have them like top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle, bottom right.
07Even the DA idea should be posted there
(All I said was I walked in)
I didn't have to hide in a corner in the feetal position for a few months till Season 2

9I guess I have a thing for drama you can say. Though not necessarily in the way you'd think... )
Filly's don't know 'bout dat IRC

./sadness

TF2?
Yeah.
TF2.
Yeah, just link... it'll show up without a thumbnail for you, though
Oh yeah.
9I don't believe in behaving dramatically, but I'm good at tweaking situations to create high emotional impacts. )
15(you are a thespian )
9XP thanks I think )
well its time for me to head out for work
cya Synros
7(yfw I realized I'm a thespian today)

Bye Synros :3
15(lol)
/me encounters a fridge monster while scavenging!
4well thanks for the booze
Later Synros
All it needs is pony models
But why do you work at 9 PM?
>.>
I've never played Team Fortress 2 ever.
/me attacks the fridge monster for 6 damage!
Play it. Do it.
/me has never played TF2 ever either*
It's free.
No excuses.
6Natleyn, PM please~

/me is hit for 2 damage by the fridge monster!
Free free?
I don't even know why it is though.
4(you and Mirth would join at roughly the same time)

No.
A graveyard, you say? :D
Its FTP
(looks at WoW)
Free to play.
ok cya in a buit
post* not thread
bit*
You can 'find' items as you play it, or you can buy them.
Haha I get it
But the items ARE NOT gamebreakers.
Wait a min...
No.
They all come with a benefit and a setback.
me?
/me 4leaves the apartment and goes into the apartment across the hall
Nah, you can leave now
I give you permission
oh ouch
Yeah, you can buy hats.
lol
Need monies for hats.
9Loffly. )
!moon
dreaming of poniessssss
Best thing I've seen in a while
/me likes this night theme too
Man I never dream about ponies.
I do
07theme = team*
/me clicks
lol oh yeah
Me to.
/me goes AFK while it loads
/me 4walks into the apartment to a field of tension
I seldom remember my dreams.
But when I do they're really awful.
I dreamt about Pinkie, mainly
No.
But you don't
4im just here to make sure nothing happened
4well
4nothing else
07Violet we should relocate to the states..
6but I do like having just us
I want gmod.
6and one poor male. . .
GMod is awesome.
nor do I have any pirated GFWL games
>.<
07poor male?
actually wait
6I would if I could. . .
I'm used to this
I have 3 sisters
and I'm the youngest
I am going to put pony models in.
It's a shame they don't actually land on the moon
well
just finished the pilot
GRRM, yep
7(DE, don't you mean 'resistant' if you can still get drunk?)
TuxRug hmm..."modded"?
Naw, next would be invulnerable)
RainbowDashCancel: modified to allow cheating, like unlimited ammo or walking through walls.
7impervious = invulnerable >.>
Not in my opinion)
Is that like Co-op with other people?
Jolly good
^ yes
o.o
... Co-op with other people...
/me giggles~
6You reminded me of a rage comic, Val. .
7 1. not permitting penetration or passage; impenetrable: The coat is impervious to rain. 2. incapable of being injured or impaired: impervious to wear and tear.
TuxRug, pfft, I would never do that
6I can see you being like
6Okay. . .
6Wait a minute. . .
6ACTUALLY
oh?
4she seems to be breathing at a more normal pace now
6I AM USED TO THIS!
O.o
o.O
O.O
O.O
(Fine..."Resistant" it is ya Nazi)
15... that's good. Is she really hurt?
-.-
(JK)
.....that is a good thing.
6Heheheheh~
/me 9sighs, sits down. "I feel like I did something bad anyway..."
*Walking in* No, she only flew into a wall.
My brain just exploded.
There is?
7(I would read it, then again, I'm in it :P)
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/map-of-equestria-and-portal-pony-mod.html here is one of the mentions of them
You like bananas that much?
I am terribly sorry to hear that
Yaaaaay
http://thinkingwithponies.blogspot.com/2011/09/wheat-apples-cellos-and-random.html
/me 13murmurs something half-conciously
/me 9frowns, then pauses and looks up, biting her lip. "She's waking up... I... I should go."
inb4pinkamina
Too much sugar.
6Scary?
6Me?
6^-^
6^-^
Well then, I shall go celebrate.
6^-^
O_o
15Oh, she's asleep again.
13(yfw I'm doing THAT in my sleep again)
What EVER would make you think that dearie? n.~
Oh yeah, the Physics lecture
?
That must have taken some balls
15(not more scary humming...)
lol
6Hehehehehe. . . . .
lol really?
6Heheheehehehe~~~
Aha. . . Aahaahahaah~
/me returns to grinding on rats.
I don't wanna go I'm scared
15your face when
I'm pretty sure he did
mommy!
He did.
15opposite of MFW, my face when
There are pictures.
4i think that she might have something wrong with her respiratory system
6Dies ist das Gefühl, wir alle haben. . .~
/me 9flinches, then nods slightly, trotting past the ponies in the room to sit dejectedly in the commons area.
QUIT SPEAKING LANGUAGES THAT AREN'T AMERICAN
I need to call some random show out for physical impossibilities.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/physics-brony-gets-pile-of-free-pony.html
I AM ALONE AND FRAGILE
yup, foundit
haha
Wow can't believe it
Whoa. Awesome.
GRRM, and?
Oh hey fluttershy.Just level grinding on rats.
I mean...my mind is conflicted
4uh, is that a normal thing she does?
/me 15shivers, remembering the last time she did this. Acting quickly for his ill body, he trots over and nudges her softly, attempting to rouse her.
well
13VV calls people "dearie". lol Thats kinda cute.
GRRM, lol
07Hey I do too...
07Never noticed?
/me cries
15Occasionally. Would you mind giving us a moment? She's probably going to be... jumpy.
GRRM, they're journalists.
he has said that they picked basically the worst picture of him to use :/
6Luna is cutest of all cutes <#
/me 4feels a chill come over his body
4ok
6 <3 *
07Lies
07i'm just me
4ill be outside
He says he's a 'writer', quit his job at Wal-Mart, married a 19 year old, and now collects unemployment.
07the pony from the moon
13As her sig states. :P
lol I like the official merch
/me 4jumps back
07indeed
we;;
he outright said 'I have aspergers'
/me 9looks up at DE, then back down, tearing up. "I'm a bad pony..."
/me feels less threatened
uh huh
/me 15falls back onto his flank, surprised and mildly shocked. Reacting quickly, he leans forward. "Tink, Tink are you okay?"
Wha?
13Wha, how did I get here?
/me hugs Fluttershy
I mean, it's still the same dolls before, but now based on an awesome version of the show
07but i'm glad we had this think-tank tonight
Asperger's Syndrome
07some great ideas!
PHOTOBUCKET! Y U STUCK AT 94%?
15DecapKing and DE found you
well, and less creepy-looking
6SOON
Unless they were physical statues that looked EXACTLY like the characters in the show...then maybe I would do it
/me 4gets back up
.....~hide me~......
/me 7is writing on a scroll on his desk from across the hall, listening intently, but working.
15Seeing as I'm not in much condition to chase you around...
4you crashed into a wall
Pizzicato yes that too
*Yelling up the stairs* You fought the wall and the wall won!
/me is giggling uncontrollably.
/me 13looks around, seeing the ponies in the room. "Oh, oh CELESTIA! I've got to go!"
GRRM, it occurs to me that they very well could have interviewed a multitude of people and simply picked the most socially maladjusted one of the lot.
With other comorbid things.
However, my cousin (a computeer geek) actually does have it
But a doll that comes with accessories to comb their manes...
/me laughs.
stupid Twilight....
I have to admit that made me laugh really hard
I mean, it doesn't affect my view of the show
but man, this would not be a good go-to source
exactly Pizzicato
4WHOA WHOA WHOA
/me 4stops MirthTinker
Yeah.
I saw that.
I guess I'm not at the stage of acceptance yet >_<
4you cant fly in this condition
I have been officially diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome
lol it might not come at all, some don't like the brushables
6What other Twilight is there? o:
/me hugs Fluttershy tighter, it's gonna be ok,
Yes?
07Looks like we are gonna have a busy weekend...
/me 9shakes her head. "I don't know about that..."
(I think so..)
I like busy weekends :P
makes me feel alive
... there was an ant in my ear
Well that's only because ignorant people aren't able to understand there is a clear difference.
yo yo yo, whats up everypony
wat
Aspies do not behave stereotypically Autistic.
They don't flap their arms when they get upset, or things like that.
13NO! MY MOTHER- YOU- THAT OTHER MARE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS!
They appear normal if not for a few comorbids
possibly
lol
4wait wait wait
/me 13tries desperately to fight her own anatomy to get away
07and a busy week too..
9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l1sgfLmC1Y for clarification. >> )
example: someone with Aspergers is at a funeral, knows everyone is in a down mood, but is in a way unable to empathize
9for clarification purposes. )
Send me to a job interview, I'll be like Fluttershy >.>
Tux that is also false
Aspies can empathize
Haha
They may not express it the same way a neurotypical or "normal" person would.
Therfore it's assumed they are unempathetic.
/me 7(is the element of shippery)
ok
I'm sure we can all relate certain emotional situations to a ponies' character
With my luck
Dude, I don't even
Something like that
I know that's kind of a weird way of putting it
Well that's a pretty good way of putting it.
why... are we talking about social disorders...
(xD)
*shrug*, 'cause.
Or more prone to behaving cruelly
First episode, yeah
go from one topic to the next
I never said that, I was stating facts
Yeah it's random
I'm stating facts too.
/me lays down with Fluttershy.
wow
Please tell me you are a girl if you did that
that was...weird
4MirthTinker, are you going to freak out again?
I'm sorry, Fluttershy
I got kicked out again >.<
Lol @ Fluttershy
It's gonna be fine, I know these things.
Yea it's why the channel turns to shit when we start talking about music
Hey, everypony!
hello KnightLight
Heya
Ticket Master
I'm watching Ticket Master now
well
Pizzicato XD Yeah, a couple hours ago we were talking about music,
Well...it's because we didn't have Faust Vision for G3.5 and below
I saw G4 was awesome.
then ponies
/me 15smiles sadly, glad to see the desired effects have taken hold. "I know. But that's not the point. Control is only useful when it is given willingly, not taken forcefully. But that's besides the point right now. We need to talk for a moment."
07nope
GRRM: welcome to ponies
4want me to leave?
heh thanks
These words..."streamception"...confuse me
oops, sorry about that...
!S2
15If you would please. Go relax, have a drink, maybe check on Fluttershy if she seems distressed. We'll be fine.
Season 2 begins in 8d:08h:42m:28s
It's more of a higher sense and desire for fairness.
4no problem
hehe...
Yep
/me 4leaves and goes to the commons area
TOO long!
everyone in the building is having issues
way too long.
I know...
!link
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVh5hrFv0bE - Pony Holocaust Teaser
I'm lost here...
like, 8 hours, 8 minutes too long!
4dont mind me
4im here for booze
....
no it's fine
uh...don't you mean 'days', Knight?
I do homework and study like a boss on a regular basis
Hi
oh, lol!
it's when one of the streamers streams another stream.
lol
But mentally, I'm stronger than ever
Already scavenged the fridge. I am waitng for the respawn.
/me just derp'd
4damn
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quazTOZokd4
That was nuts!
/me 4goes over to DE and Fluttershy
Is it okay to cross streams?
he was replying to me, I asked why interview an aspie
No.
Well, pretty well in shape, but my cardio is terrible.
Only as a last resort.
instead of someone not socially inept
Hello Toasty :3
9oh? )
hello :D
yes, it is
4Fluttershy
yeah sorry....
15(she's handling the high-emotion part fine... but wait for the /other/ part first...)
#EquestriaAfterDark
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznlDlNPw4Q&feature=related
go there for this type of convo.
07hmm you could run a traffic monitor..
I got a little defensive there for a second
4disappearing doesnt solve any problems
10 hours
o.o
EquestriaAfterDark?
4i have always been trying to run from the specters in my past
oh wow
Okay you want me to be quiet now
/me 9shakes her head again, not believing him.
GRRM: it's the "mature" section of the pony-chats
15(inb4 Gilda)
why is there an sperger's discussion in this chan
4moving from city to city
DecapKing: +2 to speech.
There isn't
oh
Not anymore
there isnt
good
dont even pay attention
7(oh yeah, guess I should mention that, Fluttershy, we /do/ write clopfic in here occaisionally...sometimes...a lot)
...
..............
!hug
?
me
Hugtiem? :3
everyone! to the batca---err...#equestriaafterdark!
Note to self...need to watch Lord of the Rings...

Okay. I need to find a single quote from a random movie and remix it.
Oh really?! Didn't know that

Hugtiem? :3

07We had someone liften with us on our wifi.. while he was visiting various "evil" websites
I tried going to EquestriaAfterDark.
T_T
sorry
Assuming you were referring to me

*Ahem* It is the pony equivalent of....oh should I spoil the pure innocence?)
you dont need to say yes to hugtiem
I didn't know
well I mean do they
xD
Weiiiiirrrrdddd place. My adult mind couldn't even fathom it
Is LotR a good series?
Worth watching?
not a clue in the world
sorry
it's a baaaaaad place
I've never been to EqAD
*inception button* BRAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
(Well...we COULD)
No, it's horrible. Best not to bother.
assuming you're talking about the movie trilogy
and, sadly, I have to moderate it T_T
CogWeaver, dont' hate
7NO
oops, gtg, ttyl
/me plans to never visit EquestriaAfterDark.
xD
No, the TV show
7...oh
good policy, Knight
oh, well then in that case, I have no idea XD
4(pony based erotica)
/me 15goes to find images...
7well, you never know
I hate violence fics...
omg...
/me 13is in such a bad mood >.<
>_<
Or you were being sarcastic...
dang
4(yes)
Hi
6D: Why Octi. . ?
(....)
I'm doing too many things at once sorry, lol
6I mean, I am too, but. . .
Hello mook
9ooohhhh! )
I'm a little absent-minded to obviousness right now
7clopping...to put this delicately...
9Ah. I get it now. Hehe. )
(*Waits for thought to sink in*)
See: Mortal Kombat
:P
4(we get it)
I agree to that Rainbow
I want a Fluttershy plushie :(
15(clopping is the pony equivalent of fapping)
:-p
I want a rainbow Plushie
7http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/faces/225.png
meh let 'em
You spin my head right round, right round
No, I really haven't seen it
Just the first movie actually
15that's the one i was looking for RS
13lol
I really don't want to hear spoilers, no, lol
(And thats how equestria was made)
6I know how you feel. . .
15lawl
/me 13hugs VV back
Grey Rainbow Dash
Spose, stupid Rihanna ruined that song for me
That's actually a flashback sequence
Tux didn't you invite me to EAD?
Spin Vynl is the cutest thing ever.
I hate it when crappy pop acts sample/cover songs
don't want to hear, even if it's a joke
13I dunno. Over-reacting probably.
ello everyone
13lol
Eh, they do it right sometimes.
4(so we have that sorted out?)
Anyway, that's over)
Like Kanye did Power.
9xP )
okay
Spose, I've never seen it done well
ever.
Its like 12 girls for every one boy.
15(anyways, waiting on you Tinkerbelle)
9- laughs like Pinkamena Diane Pie - )
exactly
I mean, canon
I apologize for earlier, I just was trying to educate people.
15(also i've starred in several clopfics)
but i have no idea how to input it
4(im waiting on you Fluttershy)
I heard 21st Century Schizoid Man.
But that's all the spoilers I know
Apparently we can only discuss ponies here
/me 9trembles, but nods. "Still..."
ANYWAY
I wasn't doing a monologue
Season 2
I was trying to express a complicated subject
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8srUyAIjCdo Thats why I like Power. I watch that every day.
I was fine with the discussion, but...
whats aspergers
07yep!
9I've been RPing since I was 13, guys. =w=; I didn't really do anything erotic til about 15, but still. )
:(
I bet you are excited!
07YEP!
feio345: it's a social disorder
ohay Luna
:D
Ponism is supposed to be a escape, and talking about our disorders defeats the point.
07and 18hrs:31mins before BMN Starts!
Is it a monologue when I normal person tries to explain something?
Luna! Hiya
/me hugs Luna
oh ok
07We have a great line up!
I have that
15(^)
i have dyspraxia
Yeah, why are we talking about that anyway?
I just have ADD
has everyone seen this? (hold on 2 secs)
I'm actually enrolled in the Haugland Learning Center
13(Fluttershy, yfw I have a 50 page log of SilverxMe rp campaign)
Which is for people with Aspergers
6Mmmmmm.. .
I thought Rainbow Dash killed him
I just wanted to watch the world burn.
9MirthTinker: oh dear )
He has his own show now too?!
6Thus the feeling I had about having things stolen comes back. . .
You're a pyromaniac!
13Yeah...
http://www.deviantart.com/#/d49a538
(This is relevant to my interests)
/me hands Radimir gasoline
I think
I guess since everyone's opening up about their diagnoses, I probably should too.
that is the cutest thing i've ever seen
/me 6facehoofs
4(fallout?)
or one of.
07lol
(It's a meme name)
9I think I feel loved though I'm not sure... =w=; )
13It basically feels like someone stole my OC (I know technically she isnt mine) and is claiming it for themselves!
07it happends...
(Your loved)
6Sir Lintsalot should get his own spinoff.
I don't want to be kicked just for trying to explain something.
0Fiiiine
(I must see this log eventually MirthTinker )
15(oh yes you must)
0Oh, hey, right there at #2...
/me wonders if Pizzicato is still here
4i have been through something like that before
Like?
07The best thing you can do is ignore them..
Huh?
ciao guys
wow...this is starting to get annoying
13https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qs_gd858-qIbyqdRg3MhEKPZO8uwWTFuwkuWZcc9na4/edit?pli=1&hl=en_US
*rimshot*
badumching!
the disconnects that is
15(let's just assume only about 1/3 of it is us bucking... >.> )
I don't get it Rainbow Dash, but my feelings are hurt all the same.
13Yeah. But its not me. Its the community.
...Why do ponies have cows and pigs?
I guess they can use the cow's milk.
Goldfrapp, La Roux, Royksopp
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zst3QUsPRY
But why the pigs?
(I loaded it in 1 sec)
and the last 3 bands you've mentioned
I <3 Goldfrapp
15(mfw we spent this much time RPing and it's not even canon to our plot. lawl)
Oh, I get it now.
Baroque is a period of music history in the 1700's-1800's
(Do I get a cookie?)
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
you'd like them
(xD)
On to my demo
/me is counting down
Later guyz

Oh, installing.

13Thanks guys.
/me 13hugs back
I was going to see her in concert, then found out they sold the tickets in June
(Anyway, we are off track, back to story)
lol
The concert wasn't even until fall
13I...don't think I'm ready to accept that, I haven't seen anything to show the contrary.
/me 13brushes the chain aside, trying to sit up with her wings still pinned
welp go I must
I really wanna go see him in Nov.
Oh no!
First my DLC won't work because it won't download past 1%, then my demo won't install past 1%
15(mirthtinker, i got off of you and put the chain back on. )
lol
15(like, a while ago)
13(oh)
4that would be something no pony should ever want to do
the one that's hidden behind secutity at Aperture labs
*security
/me hugs Fluttershy harder.
Not I listen to their music all the time like them
/me gained +7 to hugz.
ahh ok
/me 15nodded meekly. "I understand. It'll take time to prove to you that nothing happened, and that nothing was happening. I'm sorry, i truly... *pant* am..."
bleep bloop
07blib
/me 15starts gasping for breath, suddenly breaking out into a cold sweat.
>:( Bloop.
I'm looking forward to bleeping the bloop
Maybe I heard about them because Remind Me was used in a Geico ad
4all you can really do is just move along
wayto not work... grr.
that's not very nice, Suffuri :(
first heard of them on this mix CD someone gave me
!moon
Grab my tail, Spose!
we all wanted to know gwahahahaaa
Well that was fun
how do you bold names like that?
and actually, speaking of that CD, it also had an amazing remix of Goldfrapp's Utopia on it
you... did? :O
yeah last time it said Pinkie Pie
yes please )
Pinkie can't be murdered :O
!moon
Grab my tail, TuxRug!
4that would be something no pony should ever want to do
/me feels a cold chill run down his spine...
13(I should really split it into a series of docs)
But on an TOALLY RELATED topic
4all you can really do is just move along
TuxRug, yeah I wish I had animation skills
I don't get it
as it is, I dunno that I can even pull it off at all
Why did Derpy kick you?
0Reeeeally?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
because he went !moon

OH CRAP
Tux I always loved this album cover by Royksopp

No...it isn't
whoops!
4something wrong Denied?
/me moves towards the landing.
forgot that it goes routlett mode on us mods if we just type !moon
/me 0facehoofs
/me lowered her voice to a whisper. "I'm a bad, bad pony... I just know it."
Yeah...just this /weird/ feeling.
Huh?
13Hmm, still not sure where I know this tune from...
TuxRug, yeah same as with my PMV....I wanted the ponies to lipsync the vocals in the song
4no you arent, never say that, you are one of the nicest, most caring ponies i have ever met
/me 9looks up, her eyes dull. "What's going on...?"
thats why she cant fly and all
inferior genes
4im not sure
ooh! good tune that
That and the dancing... I think it would be really awesome for spike to pull off some of nsync's rediculously impressive choreography
/me starts up the stairs.
4i wouldnt worry about it now
She CAN fly though...:P
I think it's just rediculous choreography
/me 9pushes herself up shakily, watching DE go up with a unreadable expression.
0Brb~
well I enjoyed the episodes I've seen
9Confound you ponies... >< my weakness is rp... I'll never be able to leave now... )
k
have a good night
night
/me 4ears perk up as he hears a scream of pain
(Muahahahaha)
15(good, cuz I need sleep. that means you'll be here when i come back. woot)
4stay here
13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HjLN1TA3bc
13This one.
well thats a given
among other ideas.
13I know that tune from somewhere.
/me 4runs upstairs to Silvermane's apartment
Rainbow Dash's parents died in the Rainbow Factory
13Probably from a million other remixs. lol
according to my fanfic I haven't wrote yet...
yeah their videos tend to get pretty abstract
That would be an interesting take on it
haha
I like surrealism
It's very dream like
/me enters Silvermane's room, his eyes going to the open window.
he does music videos for people like Aphex Twin, Bjork and Squarepusher
yep
http://yhoo.it/o4swcK
I like to think of his style as biopunk surrealism
/me 4rushes over to Silvermane
4shit, shit shit shit shit
13(I'm suffering from CMIS right now)
or no sorry, Norwegian
15(crazy mare... something syndrome?)
meh
whatevski
And they let Louis CK improv all of Spikes dialogue.
nah
4Silver, please dont tell me you used that stimulant that i had given you
Louis CK curses too much
(Instability syndrome?)
lol
That's the point.
And yea Röyksopp is Norwegian.
best of theirs I've heard since "Poor Leno"
I don't think it'll even be a plot point
15(decapKing, I'm on Cola leaves, been using them for a looooooong time. It's canon too)
9o-o Cola leaves? )
Yeah but ponies keep you all night.
Every night.
I can see why they'd use it in an ad, it's very catchy
That's why we're here.
EqD is really distracting
Ponies, man.
(Like cocaine I am guessing...?)
15(stimulant, high-caffeine dosage, chemically addictive with repeated use)
Damn, Safari...
Yeah dude ponies mess you up.
(Special talent mirth?)
You'll get like, pony withdrawal.
I need at least one pony hit ever 12 hours.
hehe yup
(heck, we need like a list)
9oooh! Kinda like my chocolate covered coffee beans? )
I've had to fill my MP3 player with pony music to get my hits on the road.
I see ponies in my sleep. I even see ponies in my games.
Damn, this keeps refreshing
4Silver, have you been using cola leaves again?
/me speeds up, gaining on MirthTinker again.
and thats it
15(kinda. read the logs, see interesting... results of his usage during testosterone-high)
7(Silvermane and I have tossed the idea of a shipping catalog about, with character bios for reference)
Haha.
which I guess is a good thing
You can say erectile dysfunction, d00d.
Mirth! Slow down!
(Sounds good RS)
(Oh?)
Ponies on my desktop. I see ponies. I read ponies. I dream ponies. Think I'm an addict. :P
4shit
and have pony silhouettes falling from the sky like in the Mad Men open
I don't dream ponies.
/me 13glances back to see DE, narrowing her eyes. She fakes a left and darts into an alleyway to the right, disappearing from sight.
But I don't remember my dreams
Define "stream"
Ha.
/me 0points left
/me 4reaches into his bag and pulls out a syringe
I mean let's be honest, you don't need to have ED to use those pills.
I may just post an ad on craigslist
4this should help
*scratches head*
Haha...?
/me 4injects the contents of the syringe into Silvermane
That would be interesting.
TuxOtaku, Ponyception?
0Stream = live online broadcast
bwaaaaauuuuummmm
/me 9flinches as she watches, starting to hyperventilate. "It's my fault... he's going to die and it's my fault..." she whimpered.
did you just ping youself, TuxOtaku ?
grrr
lol
Mirth! Stop for gods sakes!
mine is already registered on this network
4no it isnt
has been for years
I've been using this for years, just not hear
like in Inception, a dream within a dream.
same
*here
no settling.
...Okay I'm kidding.
I own tuxotaku.com
lol
dammit.
Not sure how that would work
TuxOtaku: that wouldn't happen with me, because my name is incredibly common.
TuxOtaku: I own tuxrug.net
Fuck timezones.
DOPPELGANGER!
It's..
STREAMCEPTION
sorry Dari, busy night.
FUCKING SAFARI
omg
Oooo...comic
Lol!
lol
/me 4winks into existence, the teleportation fading
Twins?
photobucket! upload faster!
:p
9I mean, right now.)
I do like that comic
4(bow chicka wow wow)
Haha
RainbowDashCancel, you lost me there.
9xP )
I'm not really a gamer.
/me 4lets Maleficent through
/me flies through a grocery cart, shaking off some hanging lettuce.
Okay, it was a dumb Halo Reach reference. I must be in the wrong area
yeah I haven't played halo since halo 2
anyway.
good night guys <3
/me 9shakes off DecapKing, lowering her head, letting choking sobs overtake her already shaking frame.
you're freaking me out dude, lol
I feel like I just ate some bad acid.
you know you've had too much pony when you accidentally pronouce the word "fool" as "foal" in public
I'm terrified I'm going to someday say 'everypony' or some varient
And now, some appropriate music for Tux and Tux
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdIlP488n14
/me slows to a hover.
!moon
Grab my tail, Dark_Fawful!
barely, tux. Then again I look like everybody it seems. one of my college profs thought my ex and I were related (not even same nationality, she's hispanic, I'm completely caucasian)
/me scans the streets for a sign as to where MirthTinker went.
/me 4shudders as he feels a chill rush down his spine
lol
/me 9whispers after a moment, voice full of suppressed emotions. "Do you understand me?"
4i do
Should probably go to sleep
/me 4works with a stern look on his face, his horn glowing as he scans Silvermane's vitals. After a moment, he reaches into his medical bag and levitates a syringe. Embedding it into Silver's leg, he pushes the plunger and steps back. "That's all we can do for now, he just needs to rest and relax."
Maybe I'll have a pony dream
Finding a recent photo is hard...
Hopefully
To the moon!
13(yes, but this is FAR from canon)
!moon
Grab my tail, RainbowDashCancel!
15(no kidding >.> )
TuxOtaku: you actually look a bit like one of my cousins.
4(maybe its a different canon)
ohay again, Luna
Finally I feel full.
night Nittany_Tiger_
Night Nittany

thanks
0Night
#BronyState?
Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )
/me 4goes and attempts to get Fluttershy off of Silvermane
night
pretty sure it's irc.bronyserv.co.cc
07irc.bronyserv.co.cc
right, but hopefully Luna can find me a server as well. I found it once upon a time but forgot where
9This COULD be a canon... )
15(DecapKing, that was OOC clinging to me)
/me sighs, then takes off high into the sky.
4(oh)
oiy....
FINALLY
WOOO, Star Fox 64 3D comes out tomorrow!
(Silvermane: That is the effect I have been thinking of)
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/TwiBox.jpg
13(this interferes a LOT with the established plot, it would be hard to work in all the details)
Haha, Marshmellon's quote references me.
4so, how you feeling?
6Good job Val!
/me 9pauses, then follows DecapKing, silently watching Silvermane.
/me 15rolls over, no longer simply unconscious but now in a pained sleep.
TuxOtaku: probably the most recent photo I can find that's relatively decent. I'm on the left in the Thunderwolves hoodie.
http://bit.ly/pHsLIg
15(yeah yeah yeah... damn)
Majora's Mask might not be that far away on the 3DS
it's already tempting, but that would settle the deal
Yes, it means you're cute
15(nothing. nothing at all.)
13(uhhh...nothing)
/me blushes
4we should probably let him get his sleep
Well...let's see here...
"Total pageviews" - Real, or scripted?
/me giggles~
07Looks great Val!
7speaking of sleep and lack thereof...
6Oh you~ Keep up the wonderful work okay?
15yeah, should probably wrap it for tonight
6I am goig to get my 50 minutes of sleep. . .
/me *dash salute*
9.... tell me anyway? >> )
and thanks Luna
15(nein)
7Mirth is pregnant in canon and non-canon storylines depict her already having the foal
15we don't know that yet though
Wassap?
myeah... it's kinda weird how all the related media for FiM really talks down to kids already
9-looks down- oh... )
9-feels left out- ._. )
7yes we do, you just don't want to admit that not using protection 3 times is a bad idea >.>
We should protest by not watching the show!!
Based upon that and assuming a 200% drain rate...
/me 15rolls his eyes. "In canon I mean"
NEVER!!!
hay Centigrade
TuxRug, yeah it's the eyes and the moustache that make you seem slughtly hispanic
Actually 300%
crap
trollemoticons doesn't work here
9;_; Pregnancy is my weakness... especially illicit pregnancy )
15... it's been a week. we know Jack
not sure if the photo on my page has it or not...but I recently shaved off my moustache because my gf is really ticklish and would go into fits of laughter if I tried kissing her
That gives me 9 hours give or take a few before Mirth drops out of the sky....
13well yeah, I'm just saying she's /going/ to find out about it
0750 mins poor Girl :(
mmhmm
reminds me when I used to be in the animation department
15eventually... but for now let him dream that he didn't completely screw up royally
ohey! the pinkie upload didn't take hours!
07I completely forgot to mention us on Google+...
9Methinks there's a disagreement of plotline here?
9)
http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/PinkieBox.jpg
07Note to self... DO IT NEXT TIME
we have a google+
?
07I use my own account for it
That's cute
15she's just teasing me
NARCISSISM!
her toy does, myeah
9sounds dramatic
15read the logs, and you'll understand it fully. (It's rated nc-17)
it should say "Do you like mmmmmm bananas?"
13okay, tomorrow, we show these shippers our CANON story
lol
0lol
4is it more dramatic than this story?
9oh dear...
...
Ok, however my father is still canonic.
9-glares at Silvermane-
mfw fluttershy's hair is the same color as pinkie's base color...
9You... you... you....
someone should hack a celestia toy to say that :P
/me 15shuffles away from the glare
...and then put it back in the store
they should.
They really should
9GAH!
XD "Mommy why does she say that!?"
Oh wait...Fluttershy doesn't know my backstory
15I MEANT IN THE CANON STORY
15DON'T HURT ME
ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON-aaaah! BEEEEEEEEEEY-ETCH!
9I'm sooo angry!!!
I did, and boy were her wings pretty, Luna!
07hehehe yes
13Fluttershy, you haven't come up in canon yet, but you're welcome to sit in and make an appearance
15and this, colts, is why you never juggle two fillies
lol I still kinda want that toy :P
/me 13I know dear, I know
O_o
4does Fluttershy not know about DE's backstory?
6Pinkie looks good Val. . . Do not stop the good work. . .
Should I tell Fluttershy my back story or let it come up in canon?
I blame cog
7oh Fluttershy? you probably shouldn't be too jealous of Silvermane's relationship...I'll tell you about it later
Yeah, i blame cog aswell.
...
what'd *I* do?
:)
:D
Hats aren't very good for the digestion :-(
Wait, you're not Luna.
Yer also I balme him
If only you would let me tie you up and take you to SummerRain, this kinda thing wouldnt happen
I was like "wtf! I wanted a plum, not a peach!"
7no...really...when I tell you you'll shit bricks
9-sniffles- Darn it... you made me fall for you... hard.
/me facehoofs* oh...you're still on THAT, Filter?

Goodnight RS**
There are ways to BS itunes credit
15(hey guys, watch me create another canon reality again)
13Fluttershy...if you want you can have him
Yeah, appdb gives iTunes a "garbage" rating
4Fluttershy, you sound like you need a distraction
9serious* >>
13well, not in mane canon, but in the alternate canon perhaps
/me 15lifts Fluttershy's face up and kisses her gently
15:D
9Silvermane: player... )
0www.thepiratebay.org
Pretty sure it's only available on iTunes
/me 9blinks, taking a moment to catch on, then eyes widen. "Ahh...."
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DSD5XV2JEA&feature=colike
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Haha
0I've got every episode, I could upload each of them to mediafire...
But yeah, that's the only place I've seen it
9DeniedExistenceMobile: -pats head- )
I don't wanna get caught pirating though :(
13sorry DE, Ret already left :P
We're losing people!
(Me too silver)
....
Especially for My Little Pony
well, then find the eps on megaupload and such?
4i can confuse you even more
13should I just tell her?
Still Pirating
15yes
9Oh dear...
0There were pony blurays at the local target
Oh, he definitely /left/, Mirth.
you can download all the eps in 1080p in mp4 files that way
/me has quit (Quit: )
wat, Centigrade?
/me 15laughs at the sheer volume of shit-bricks we dropped upon poor Fluttershy in the course of a few hours
0Yep, MLP:FiM BluRays
07Alright Val
07time for me to leave too
07it's 7:20 AM
9o-o oh. That's it? I already caught onto that from the earlier conversation.
4eeeeyup
No, I lied
13Everyone be leaving. Goodnight guys.
07Sorry.. my eyes are shutting down in auto-mode now
9In a way... I find that... disturbing but not unbelievable.
07and I need to stream tonight...
13I get that a lot >.> even irl
13Its alright Luna.
9Yeah.
9o-o
0lol

13I pull off women a little /too/ naturally at times
I didn't see anything about Blu-Rays on Target's site
13Eh... I'm working on it a little. But its slow going I'm afraid.
/me 15gets ALLLLL the fillies
awwww, gnight luna

frolicing in fields of flowers
07Night you two! I hope we can fix the stream tomorrow...
9Soo...
13yes, you mentioned that
13I just... kinda want to cry. But I'm not gonna burden anyone else with my problems.
/me 15picks up Fluttershy
07Veemi.... :@:@!!:@
see dat? dat be aliteration :P
13Goodnight Luna.
13I feel like a cheap cop-out sometimes
4my backstory involves genocide O.O
07Octavia...sometimes crying is a great way to get rid of certain frustrations or emotions
Don't think you can get caught doing that, no
07Goodnight everypony
/me is going to make you guess, and wont tell you if it is right.
Well I don't think they'd (youtube) like it but chances of you getting caught are like 0.01%
0BAI, LUNA

I doubt it's even illegal
07I see you tonight during BMN?
0Night Luna

9haha xP
07Good!
9Oooh an alter ego.
07We have some live Fluttershy-ception again :)

Night Silvermane

Mabye I am really Silvermane, *Awaits mindfuck* 0_o
I'd rather talk ponies...
I used to but I don't really anymore.
9I already kissed her xP

wow, the irony
I say we're always here for you

sorry about that
Well, I'm not much for going out drinking at all, really :P

15(oh crap...)
4MFW i somehow get involved in canon
0Mods exist, post ponies.
13TF kinda line coming here, but lately I feel like...
13Octavia isn't credit to team. lol
haha, yeah
That would be fun
D:
untrue!
13...yes?
13I'm a fragment of his personality
9MirthTinker: :3 Cool
0I've just got the one (that I know of)
you're a delightful addition to the team
13the cheerful self-concious side
/me 9suddenly blushes, and lowers herself. "O-Oh, um... never mind... I..."
and we're glad to have you
4im an alter ego, mainly a manifestation of rage, depression, memories, and history
13I dunno. Everyone else is more involved or doing more. I'm not really doing anything but being here.
/me 15grabs Fluttershy, pulling her close. "What is it, Fluttershy?"
I only know of one IRL but he moved away recently
9MirthTinker: Dude, I already told you I have way too many alter egos right? Boys, girls, hermaphrodites, ponies...
and being here somehow means you aren't important to the team?
13...
13Indeed.
13Ret is a little closer to the whole than I am, but yeah, I'm familiar with alter egos
http://i.imgur.com/rJ3W4.jpg
13I've played quite a few over the years
4this alter ego has always been here
13lol
/me 9blushes, staring at Silvermane with wide eyes, breathing shakily. "I... oh my..."
13Rainbow Dash always dresses in style?
07Octa.. we promoted you to teamleader for a reason
Omg LOL!
NO.
07we have faith in you
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6KScFGXiJk&feature=related
07and now i'm leaving
/me 15blushes in return when he realizes his wings are unfurled. "Just say it"
gnight luna
see you tomorrow
07again...
07see you tonight!
13Thanks Luna.
13Goodnight Luna.

/me is trying to think of something mean Applejack has done. Closest I can find is poor sportsmareship in Fall Weather Friends
Hi
*bye
(Fixed that for you
I try not to, but I just can't help myself from thinking "awwww cuuutee!"
sigh
I know that feeling, unfortunately
Marshmelon: I read that in Applejack's voice.
._.
Now the countdown begins, till they are parodied on South Park
9__9
!S2
Season 2 begins in 8d:06h:27m:33s
The thing Marshmelon is one of the little people wrestlers, looks Goth. I'm thinking "Hmm, I might hit that"
Iks: why is that?
Yes, Iks, why is that?
While we're on the topic of sad
Those two stories made me flat-out bawl
Iks: they could fix that by making them zmobies
Tux, I BAWLED my EYES out.
I was at that point near the end.
I haven't cried since my great-grandmother's funeral years ago
I don't think I ever cried to anything reading. Just got a sore gut or gloomy mood for the day.
That happened to me for the rest of the day
And all that night too
Fortunately
I got over it today
!moon
Grab my tail, Lapsus!
AWAY!
did I just sound emo?
naw
I've not cried like that since the funeral
scary movei 2 etc
lemme see if I can find a few of my favorite tear-jerkers... one of them is a sequel to the-fanfic-that-shall-not-be-named
As was the one with Pinkamena in her dream
Melt
...well that was ironic. or something.
IIIIN THE aRRRRRRRRRMS offff the AAAAAAAANNNNGEEEEEEELLS
*bawls*
roushguy: Or she'd explode into tears. Then she'd explode again... can she do that?
Well
Yes
And no
Then there'd be a second explosion of tears
>_>
Yeah
Until the universe cries.
......
dammit
<_<
Now I WANT to see that commercial
roushguy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gspElv1yvc
hows everyone doing?
BC SPCA instead of ASPCA, but same commercial
Dammit! Stop that!

A Sadfic is a good cleanser
?
No wait-- that was Apple Cider.
Fuu.
Anywya
The fic-that-shall-not-be-named wasn't really all that scary to me
Go find and watch Celamy.
gonna lose him again, looks like...
It wasn't a BAD fic
I eh'd.
TuxRug: Watch Celemy
Were his tentacles still in good shape?
Now that's sad
Her friend
Then the girl grows up
and doesn't spend any time with Celemy any more
(try with an a, Celamy?)
Celamy dies, pretty much
haha, oh wow
That was on purpose this time.
Not in a gory way, but in a really good way that fts with the rest of the story
(Celamy explained how people die earlier in the movie)
/me tilts head
trying to fix it?
Resetting name.
Something like, "You get on a bus and go to heaven and everything's real cool there" <(paraphrase)
Anyway
Now you know the plot, go watch if oyu can find
Man
I have a /lot/ of personality facets. I gave them all names and backgrounds to avoid their talking being able to mess with me
such an awesome theme:

(My sinternet is gonna be gone soon, so)
mmm coffeeee

ok then
interestingly
the first thing i thought of when hearing that awesome pinkamena theme was (wait, let me look it up for you)
that...
wat
no
not that
this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E28WrhpTzQA
hey ponies
none of these make any sense
ohh

shes currently out cold in a mixture of liqour and self pity
uhm
Delicious netsplit.
KABLAM
We shouldn't be talking about Pinkamena
Xiagu: NIIICE.
She CLEARLY caused this
Netsplit strike!
I don't think that counts as strike
I think that counts as a homerun.
fireant did that on purpose
.....
Of course.
What's going on?
You got that wrong, but
To have a little fun.
Pinkamena's the psycotic.
Mason_Trowel: the IRC channel ate something that didn't agree with it
Mason_Trowel: Unfortunately, the IRC channel isn't one to back down from an argument, and the shouting spilled over into mainchat.
...huh.
now where were we...
....Pinkie's also crazy.
She's crazy in a good way
you know, the main reason why i havnt changed my desktop background to something pinkie yet is because a cheerfull pinkie doest fit my mood right now and a pinkamena is too emo for me
they are both the same....

hi
Heya.
whats up?
well its good to have you here
where did you hear about it?
Though I've seen a few links throughout the day.
yes i am
I try.
this is another staffer
I was going to offer a server (I run a hosting business), but you have way too many for this few users, already.
well
aaaand back
I'm sure it'll work out one way or another.
I think I saw a few on Google+.
word of mouth?
Maybe it was Reddit. I don't remember — today (well, last night) was kind of a blur.
Wasn't expecting that
0WAIT
0What
0Sorry I was AFK for a really long time.
I just got up..
0O hi Rainbow
0!
was it for some kind of pony account or just people talking?
I dunno. Maybe it was something similarly-named.
IT's up on EQD
Hi
0Remember me?
YEah
Yeah
I remember seeing you last night
Lol
Took me about 30 seconds to find out the actual irc server
0Go here
bronychan.net
lol chan
0http://mibbit.com/?channel=%23ponychat&server=irc.mibbit.net
LOL
lol oh those ponies
Awesomeshy: Was it not you that corrected them in the comments?
Awesomeshy said... Best Blogger Tips [Reply To This Comment]
on that irc network, it's bronychat, not bronychan.
That would make logical sense
Oh ehehe
I forgot I put my name
Haha
I should probably add this to my auto-connect
It's a good thing you corrected that when you did.
y we dont need peoples getting it wrong nd not coming lol
and was smashing the F5 key until I saw something
I'm totally not IRC savvy at all
We're advising you not to do it before one of the ops gives you das boot for it.
i did but then it was really slow
Awesomeshy: http://kylej.name/i/1r1ZOU.png
i jelly
wow we need thems
give
its hard to ask everypony to switch over
There's only 3 left. :D
If you live close enough, sure.
Bah
No one ever does
I know that feeling.
No you don't
Sure I do
>programmer
No you don't
turned out to be the wrong alley
Awesomeshy: :D
I'm in college right now
Australia.
majoring in software engineering
Oh is it sharing time now?
Awesomeshy: Ahh, awesome. :D
I'm doing my PhD in computational chemistry
6697-6699
:D
hi
Hmm
welco....oh wait i already told you that lol
yeah, Pontang was very addament about adding SSL
Now you just need IPv6 support.
Or do you mean something else?
>_>
s/thing/where/
12Do we has colours?
7yes
4 We has colours
yes!
we even have bold
My eyes.
we dont have flsh though
8 Darn
6woot
we have this
Rainbow
If I can
I dont have owner atm either for some reason
One second
Alright, I have to ask this. How many of you here are into the fanfiction
2Can I use colors?
The pony kind
11?
Of course
11W.. How are you owner?
11:D
Mmkay then
I have the channel registered
11How u do that
no i havnt
Use /register #ponychat password reason
hey all
11k
I think thats how
i lived on farm that had real ponies
I've kinda made it my policy to not read any pony fanfiction, ever
does that count?
hi there
I prefer OralB myself
brushing any teeth lately?
Well, Stomper
no brushint at all is best
That joke was a bit too straight forward
Awesomeshy: :D
:(
i want dash boots
Favourite pony, go
i havnt brushed sense i graduated high school back in 83
11Wtf
Dash boots?
83?
you know the chick one
11chat thing
Why not?
11I try putting /register #ponychat <reason here>
11But it won't do anything.
All ponies are my favorites. I gave up trying to pick one.
he's
You might need to put the cs
Also, 83? wat
Because that'll make him like 40 something
also yeah I'm at war with myself at favorite pony
Not that there's anything wrong with that
^
Rarity is best pony, all other opinions are invalid
nono
:-(
I hate rarity
That's not very pony-like of you, Awesomeshy
ops are giving dash boots for offenses.. it's like rewarding bad behavior *looks at the majority of american parents*
or a gem digger i guess
ya Awesomeshy thats not very pony of you
ok there are some times I like her
but for the most part she's my least favorite pony
But that's not a pony
huh?
Not that surprising
Her personality is also relatable to alot of people as weel
hot voice
I'm probably
but then parents fight and it ruins everything
leaning more towards pinkie pie tbh
oh man i forget names
I'm kinda burned out on ponies
It has to
i hope it becomes survival horror show
I won't burn out in the foreseeable future.
^
2012 etc
1212?
oh damn
i messed taht up
(so i missed any answers if there were any)
11It said it sent an email to my email
Might be GGgala, I've honestly only connected to the server once
11Prince Dari
with other networks' self-signed certs it hasn't come up like this
yet, anyway
If they all use different certs, that would happen.
tough crowd
that might be it
ya
it does. it has before, anyway.
0MEEGH
0Rainbow
0I still didn't get an e-mail
bah, this chanserv doesn't have redirect :/
don't think he's here right now
0Grrrrr
anope services, and we still need to install some modules
Pontang did
I funded everything
Why Unreal + Anope? :-(
Stomper: Dumb fabric
He couldn't get surreal services to work
Gah, Surreal is also the wrong choice. :-P
Charybdis + Atheme.
there are 50 different types of irc severs, have to pick one!
After running a medium size network for 8 years, I've found that to be the best choice for every situation.
0deadchat :(
Friends with benefits?
I used Unreal+Anope for 4 years.
:3
Unfortunately, he's quite resistant to the idea of ponies being okay.
Don't worry, he'll come around
They all do
cool title
ohay, what's the policy on using HostServ here?
pony drinking games are fun :D
0-_-
my face quote was by fluttershy when she said "it is always more difficult to fight against faith than against knowledge"
fav
When the heck did she say that?
i get "Access denied" when i do a /hs request
No custom vhost for you!
it was a quoic quote and is missed easily
my keynoard is messed up, got chewed on
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she never said that
Awesome title is awesome
^
You're going to have to quote which episode
Because I really don't recall her saying anything remotely similar to that, ever.
maybe it wasnt her
maybe it was another :/
lol
07bah autojoin

Stomper_: Ponies are not Hitler-like in any way. :-(
Such word association is something I expect to see as a bizarre neurosymptom on House.
(Nobody correct me. I'm already thinking of ways I'm wrong)
0I guess the program block trigger or whatever didn't come on.
i can see her saying that
0Oh wait now it removed all threats.

If you go on the furnet, most of the channels are 18+ for a reason. >:

The vast majority of the content on the site is not adult, and not even mature.

That's awesome :D

Yeah. We should discontinue that. Everyone got quiet, and I think Pontang changed his mind about letting me help out.

HEY!

I wouldn't change my mind over something silly as that. Aside for that, Awesomeshy owns most of these servers.

Awesomeshy: And potentially web site hosting as well (no promises, though).

Well, most of them
you played 13 yet?
I haven't played Ten Desires that much
I 1cc'd it on normal and that was it
How do I make YT videos come up
Liike it's info
I haven't even played it yet
Oddly enough
When the demo of ten desires was leaked
http://miburl.com/bpjSo9
And I was like "Nope, watching ponies"
At that point, I realised I moved onto another fandom
Espy
how about Hisoutensoku?
I still do play it
and its info
fffffff- yes we should network play sometime
Although because I'm in Australia, I can't really play that many people of a decent skill level
this is worse then out furry conversation lol
oh
I assume you're in the US
Yeah
The delay is going to be 8
At least
By being really awesome.
Chaaaaaarlie
Although if you still want to try, go ahead
Be warned, I've been playing in high delay games since IaMP
i put money in aids fund the other day
i bought ten aids jokes with that
IaMP?
hisoutensoku
07I tried .. but could not sleep
OH, yeah
/me hugs Luna.
The netcoding is horrible and mauve didn't want to make a caster for it
I actually haven't played IaMP

Click it
why? you work or school?
It'd be hard to pick just one
Oh okay
I usually play either Ibuki/Youmu/Remillia
07EspyLacopa did you see the test-stream last night?
I see
Oh actually, you might enjoy this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Txq4JS6WKI
Stomper: Work. I work for myself. My free time is entirely full of IRC and ponies and writing software.
Yup. I left after the pony episode that was on the Hub.
Hoo
07We expected more people..
ONly a few
Yesterday it was blowing up.
I'm sure you'll get plenty of people next saturday.
Stomper: Things for my business, mostly, to be honest. Also IRC bots, things I'm contracted to write, and lately, the backend for a pony image archive (see my G+ stream for development whining on part of that).
that's the point i guess xD
:O
Stomper: Really anything, though. If I need something done, I'll write something to do it for me.
I JUST REMEMBERED

k
Subject is Application Pl0X?
I didn't know anyone still used Mibbit after the hacking incident. :-\
Oh darn
It's already 11 PM, sleep time
Ok.
Everyone still uses mibbit.
It's the only good web client.
pffft its 630 here
We're planning to add a flash/java applet in the future. But that is for preference.
As good as a web client can be anyway.
Man that's hard on the eyes
Anyway, I know, there's not really many good alternatives.
in russia, severn ate nine
Can I put it as N/A
Well, if you want flexibility.
x_x
I just want no data mining and no unethical administration.
Yeah
There are other ajax clients out there.
The hacking itself wasn't the problem. It was the administrative logs that came out of it.
I see.
Mibbit is banned on 7/9 of the networks I'm on.
wow there went the conversation lol
=p
Pretty much
Stomper: Primarily, I run a web hosting business.
oh nice
Stomper: Everything you could want to know is written/linked on my G+ page.
07lol
Agree
Haha, that's always nice.
that would be great anyway
Of course.
I'm not on any networks mibbit's banned on. :P

Good.
QUITER!
I'll switch it over for BMN today then.
Prinnce-Dari
why was mibbit banned, do you know?
Can I put my profession in school as N/A
*prince
Fine.
>_>
Derpieshy: One of their servers got rooted. Loads of logs and user data (including like 10,000 [or was it 100,000?] nickserv passwords). Among the logs were Mibbit administrators talking about their unethical practices, such as working to circumvent Freenode's block.
?invite DerpyBot
omg Lordlyhour

No
I don't
yes!
why not?
I don;t care for Sci-Fi
dammit, it isn't OGN and Centravi :p
mmm
It was a sci-fi show?
i thought it was a western/pirate series
I don't care for westerns
I don't tend to like much TV at all
And that's why you should use a real client.
But this certainly didn't help.
Yeah, pretty much.
Then I'll talk
!s2
There are a few exceptions, but the only thing I really like about westerns are revolvers and stetsons
Sent
Answering ALL of the questions
But one is N/A
The profession one.
But meh, if you'r going to have IRC associated with a website you need some kind of embedded client.
!s2
Or most people won't bother.
Definitely.
Don't break derpy...!
wow
And mibbit just happens to be the best web client imo
impressive
Derpybot has to derp before she does anything

She's visible in the show
oh shit
It was in Arch repos the same day, of course.
Doesn't she just appear briefly beside Derpy, and the fanon developed there?
Amazingly, it didn't break anything! :D
Oh. gotcha.

Derpieshy: Install from sources. :D
Stomper: you're using ubuntu 11.04
don't you even
ya and its shit
Ubuntu :-(
Later moved on to Debian, then Gentoo, then Ubuntu, and finally Arch
My servers all run CentOS >:(
I managed to install gentoo
I don't think I'll ever leave.
I tried arch
The package manager is damn nice
wee i can go home now
and everything was working fine
except
see you there!
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME

Derpieshy: Nooooooooooooooooooo! </Spike>
I think I was messing up my xorg config
That's not Arch's fault :-(
yeah
I'm not blaming arch

How do you get the thumbnails to show
:D
Derpieshy: Well good. :-P
I'll stand by Arch through anything.

wat, how does arch compile from source
I haven't had to compile from source on arch yet
Well, there's the AUR (Arch User Repository)
My depression. BeefStronganoff
His moustache is touching his brain!
You can get a PKGBUILD from that and feed it to a system utility
It handles downloading, patching, dependencies, and then compilation and install.
The whole process can be automated by a pacman wrapper (I use packer).
The tick was awesome
Alot of people are AFK
I must drive them away with my bouts of whiney angsting

This is the right room, yes? It said #bronychan on Equestria Daily, but I assumed they made the same typo twice
this is the right room
Kay
yes this is right room
I lol'ed at the typo
"no one messes with lo wang!"
nice to know prob 90% of people are going to wrong place
I was trying to go to dronychan.net
er, bronychan.net
which of course, didn't resolve
First thing I did
I should uh
$ host irc.bronychan.net
Host irc.bronychan.net not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
email them and tell them to change it
Probably.
That was Derpieshy
hi

oh sheet
good idea
I thought about nabbing it and having it go to my network
/me looks

*sigh*
I haven't really shopped around lately
been using dreamhost for a few years
Ok, need to switch over all the IRCs again. :P >_>
I should go lower my prices
All the IRCs? lol wut
that was my reaction
oh lol
I have to change all of them to come here.

I think it's an HD capture card.
are y'all planning on streaming season 2?
Yeah, we're streaming all of S2 live.
I do not have the hub in my dorm
I saw that
It peaked at like 3,300.
Gunna switch over IRC.
Again.
:P
Derpieshy: I think 50 users within 3 months would be optimistic, and you wouldn't need half the network for that.
welp, money already spent
Yeah
It'll be >1000 people I'm sure of anyway.
I was surprised/impressed when I saw 4 IPs show up when I did the DNS lookup
Hello?
>1000 in the IRC
We have 300+ for BMN, and that's nothing compared to S2.
I'll pay for all the servers for another month after this one
Hey.
and if it looks like I'm spending too much money
I'll drop one or two
Yeah. Gotta see how the trend goes.
You gunna get EQD to locate here?
I'm ganna try
Maybe get a few smaller places first, as that'll be easier.
yeah
gatta build up a reputation
I did post on /www/ on bronychat, wondering how much traffic we get from there
imean ponychan
lolololol
07again?
07when..?
I'd go here from EqD
yeah, we're really understaffed as is
i dont get it
>:D
Which is meh.
I like to use mibbit with streams personally
The guys I know have between 5,000 and 10,000 listeners on one show. Dunno about the other.

YOu should be stabbed
It'll at least get more people curious.

Luna
I switch us over from the first server due to constant net splits during BMN.
This is a dilemma
Then everything's fine for a while.
07hehe? you want it? :)
07you can play with me! :D
Then suddenly our users are capped at 200.
Eh?
/me sobs in a corner
Can't have that.
/me pets Luna
Wat?
07~yay
Unfortunately it happens that the network wasn't set up for mibbit to work at the time, due to an oversight.

hello
o.o
sooo
QR code on EQD.
Anyone got a phone that reads QR codes?
what's wrong with the regular IRC networks
COME JOIN NOTHER NETWORK THIS ONE SUCKS
We haven't really advertised on any other IRC networks.
What's a QR code?
Look at EQD's last post.
You'll see.
:P
07yep
Random advertisementis not in our policy.
hmm...
We're going to build up based on satisfaction.
^ this
The regular IRC networks meaning?
Good plan.
Botnets galore.
xD
Word of mouth is the only way to go.
WEll.
That was anticlimatic
like quakenet (yeah i guess that one splits a fair bit) etc
If you mean already established large networks.
I'm contemplating whether I should apply to the job...
though i guess since this is kinda meant to just have people come through the theater thing it doesn't really matter
if i'm not mistaken
I hope I get to be in the Stats
and that is my quote
Because that would be awesome
Maths time!
maths. not even once.
i see
makes sense
You're going to run per-server BOPMs? Why?
Plus we're probably changing hubs.
Less stress I assume.
I don't get why they say that, I doo math all the time and I'm just fine
Pontang wants to change the hub to a vps rather than an ircd
whats the link to the stats page?
Derpieshy: That sentence makes no sense. You mean VPS rather than shell?
...yeah right sorry
have you tried quitting math again? it's a drug i say!
Pontang: Barely. You'll just have to run extra software and have many possibly port scan origins.
/me is covered in furr
07brb
Pontang: For a network this size, that seems highly impractical.
Er, rearrange the words on the end of the first message.
I can quit any time I want!
The VPS is cheaper tbh.
son, I'm spending $40 a month
Plus we'd like to switch to services that we know we can get support on.
You should always avoid buying IRCD shells.
They're always crap.
hey CogWeaver
wat
I suspect that's why I got disconnected earlier.
How are you doing?
Are you doing awesome? I hope you're doing awesome
VPS or dedicated
They seem cheaper too.
To all, a Goodnight
VPS can run at like $10. Pretty nice tbh
Yeah. VPS is the way to go for a network this size.
I know thrustvps offers $7.95 for VPSes
True*

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10906236/Pony/Special/pony_creator.swf
That's a start.
But with IRC, you want consistent connectivity. Dropped packets are no bueno.
There's pretty much never a guarantee for that on any providers.
Yeah.
07AllisZero search on the web for a furminator
Well, if you want to be a tech...
xD
07it's amazing
I have it, I use it on him on a weekly basis
I sit around and play with servers all day.
Still, a LOT of fur
07yes...
Yep, it works great

I would enjoy that.

Two hidden hubs, arranged geographically, and three round robins for different parts of the world (and one main one for the uncaring folks).
I see.
That's good.
We're looking for something like that.
:p
07http://i.imgur.com/csAPO.jpg
I noticed you've got a hidden hub right now
eyup
Though everything is kind of hidden since none of the hostnames are real.
deadchat
eh
fluttershy is
I only tested a few.
But, we are thinking of running Surrealservices. Mainly because we can get support from the dev team.
How cute
Drinking from the glass haha
Have you thought about Atheme? I'm good friends with the main developer, and an oper on their home network. Same with Charybdis.
My network switched from Unreal/Anope to Charybdis/Atheme a few months ago. It was the best decision we made.
Hm
07Well the glass is a "normal"thing
I only gave in after opering with Charybdis/Atheme for a few years. It was just too much... nicer.
07but I caught him here too..
07http://i.imgur.com/NmW5Q.jpg
More streamlined. Less confusing bloat.
LOL
07crazy cat is crazy
Yep
I'll give it a look.
Freenode uses a modified version of Charybdis and Atheme.
07http://i.imgur.com/Avkr5.jpg
StaticBox, their home network that I referred to earlier, does as well.
Quite a few others do. I can't remember off the top of my head.
Do you play?
07I played but quit recently
I see
It's a different way of doing things, of course. You can't expect to switch and maintain the same exact habits.
The difference for end-users is negligible.
You mean the developers?
Awesomeshy knows, he runs a channel on there.
tbh
07and this is our other cat

I have a cat myself.
Have more experience with dogs however
07I have more experience with cats.. but I had a goldenretriever before I had to travel 300 km/h per day
ye
I guess that's kind of interesting
07Last cat pic :) http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/6118/009zo2.jpg
Have you ever tried them?
I haven't. All I've heard is that they're sillier than Anope, though not quite as horribly coded.
That's a pretty coat
You should. But as I've said, they're really quite user friendly.
Yep.
I see
07finally!
07lol
Lol
I was trapped in a building
I tried to run past him XD
> Based on: Anope, Auspice, NeoStats
07I can understand that
I already don't like it
Because thugs are very very slow
lawl
But really strong
Atheme has vacation as well
!s4
I think there's an Anope module for it too
Unfortunately, he hit me
Oh?
Yeah
to three times the usual value. You can only
enough.
Taaaaaaank

lol
I think you may be asking too much of Derpy
Hmm, does charybdis allow for ~/&/@/%/+?
inb4 s4 is announced, and it's full of Trixie

I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
yes
Thank you!!

Something like that
I like the structure of it I suppose. But tbh, I'm really used to it.
Lol
and again i am ignored
all the seasons
07sounds like a tank, yes
Honestly I just have to run if I dont have my fury or some sort of explosive ready
well i would like them to age and evolve... i hate every tv show where there is never progress
like the simpsons
And Iks, in shows like these the tendency is that they never really age
07hehe yes, that might be the best choice
in Venture Brothers they age
never seen that show
and...I think that's the only one
Yeah, there are exceptions
Well, it's all up to Awesomeshy really. It's his network.
Because you're on the wrong network.
Yeah.
I do have a few questions
I'll want to help out whichever direction you decide to go. I'm just giving my advice based on my experiences throughout the years, and how much I trust the Atheme devs
:I
WAZAAAA?
Story of the blanks D:
Haro
can we switch out from unreal to charydbis without enraging a bunch of people
MFW people cry because of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wujiEeZje_M&feature=player_embedded
All right then.
well they could make it a cliffhanger for season 3
MOVIN' OUT :)
I'm guessing you're referring to the bunch in #bronystate, since the rest of the network appears empty
lol yeah
nono
Well
I ment
going down

If you do things right, the actual downtime could be kept to less than ten seconds.

Yep
I'm not gonna get watery-eyed at work am I
07yes...
baaaack
Alright, watch later it is
Well, if this can provide the best possible service for the users. I'm down with it.
07i'll add it to our playlist :P

All right, I'm here
;o
07~yay
(yay~)

Anyway, we're going to slowly move to VPS anyway.
I like that attitude.
hehehe
Does it have alfalfa monster?
That's definitely a good idea.
When are you planning to do this?
Because today, and tomorrow are bad.
not today or tomorrow
Probably not that time frame.
:p
And any time anywhere near the S2 premiere are very bad.
07omg!
We'll do it as slowly as possible.
07it happened!
Or any Friday/Saturday.
it'll probably be a little sooner than next month

Why does that make people cry...?
O_o
07it made me cry
Manly Tears.
07so it just does...!
Meh.
Linode and RapidXen are my recommendations for this kind of thing.
oh noes
Things like that don't work for me.
That said, my offer for a free node is still up.
Aaah, isnt it amazing how I percieve music differntly when i' drunk+ XD
AHahahahhaa
hi EqD
Rapidxen has something for $7.95
Maeni
Er, well, I guess not anymore. He quit
But!
Hi rets ;3
Wait
Let me get a song
I'm more drunk than I thought

You totally should.
They're located in Los Angeles?

? :D

That's not close to Europe.

[can i disconnect bronyserv.co.cc now?]
Sure.
RapidXen?
Yes
Hahhahaha oh, bugs? xD
They're in LA, Chicago, and Germany
Keep watching
That's cool
http://rapidxen.com/plans
Bye bye old server
Germany is pretty close to Europe :-P
Lmao
Didn't see that one.
xD
;o
Yeah
Chicago is the best location they have, honestly.
Well
Told 'ya
Yup XDD still watching
You can keep watching that guy's vids for complete mindfuckery.
I might buy from all three locations.
Let me see how the Athemes and Anopes are doing on one of my machines...
Mass efect seems like it's full of all kinds of up-fuckery...
Direct intervention is necessary! *dances*
lol
>.>
http://j.mp/pX1Zlt
Mass Effect is awesome.
:0
Of course, I think our biggest issue would be that to get channels from other networks to join, they probably use the unreal/anope setup. I fear they wouldn't want change.
It really is
it's not like
we're doing this any time soon
Yeah
Of course
Still planning to switch to VPSes soon.
ME1 is even buggier
12 particles of matter, four forces of nature! that's a wonderful and significant story!
Hello all
Hai o/
how about
we do the switch when we swap out the servers
\o
oh yeah we're getting rid of anope
after seeing this graph
that's gatta go
Awesomeshy: LOL
imean
That's actually old, too. Atheme has been further optimized since then.
Neither of the ME games were very buggy...
well goodnight! i'm going to sleep
Awesomeshy: Yeah. I don't think they optimize their code at all.
Goodnight MeteorVenture
05good night MeteorVenture
I came here to ask the site to proceed to stream the Season 2 Premiere when it comes. How do I do that?

i don't think you have to ask :D
Oh. I thought they were only going to do it if enough people visited and asked them.
Hence, my being here.

In that case, I'm sorry to have insulted you with my presence.
But thank you for this.
ahahahhahah
I don't have access to Hub.
07no worries
Insulted us with yourp presence?
don't worry RyanRodriguez
Yes.
you are welcome
We like people to come here and have fun. :)
how would anthem work out with unreal until we switch servers?
Well, if we go with atheme, could it be made more 'anope user' friendly?
I appreciate that...
07don't forget tonight is our Movie Night :)
Whyever not?
Yeah
Well, it should work out if that's the case.
I actually don't think I've seen any commands that were at all confusing.
Meh, I don't read fanfics anyway.
Though my Indonesians practically died.
Some people hate change. xD
I'd say "induring cupcakes" but that'd be rude
Yeah. That's for sure.
Apparently, readers interpreted it as a depraved, immature vomit puddle.
I wouldn't have suggested anything if this network were larger.
Why would "Enduring Cupcakes" be a rude statement?
Induring :P
and ohay ponies
07how you feel today?
But the goal is to create a themed pony network as Rizon is to anime or freenode is to open sourced software.
Rizon :-(
:p
And yes they were, Nashy.
There's a need for a pony network right now.
I wanted to make it mine, but the theme of the network always causes controversy.
07We switched again, yes
xD
lol kinda crashed while heading out, though i'm fine now
:o
there's already another server
07RyanRodriguez take a peek here: http://www.bronystate.co.cc/
There are several pony IRC networks out there right now.
07You can see tonight's line-up
Or www.bronystate.net :P
really?
Three, I believe, including this one.
07or bronystate.net yes!
huh
It's to be expected.
Try not to take it personal, of course
We'll just have to be bolder.
;o
Yes.
me neither :\
07Well, maybe saturday is another option ;)
Go the extra mile for the users would be the best bet.
eeeeyup!
Yup! :3
Yep.
That was not my experience, but YMMV
these are like... two movies you can't refuse
07true that!
but the pop-up window isn't working
Well, we're going to need some PR guys.
;p
Yeah, definitely.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xmVO7qjupw
The buttons work fine. :P
07Might be a browser issue, which one are you using?
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Huh. "Of Two Minds", chapter 7.
uhm
empty
Bye.
07your welcome
07see you soon!
We're going to try to get the website up as soon as possible. If I get three servers, we'll have 6 leafs to work with.
They all work.

this was posted in #bronystate a while ago
thought I'd share
As long as their geographically diverse, more servers is always good.
Exactly.
hax
At the moment, we have servers in LA, Chicago, and Paris?
And Montana

>tears
popUp is not defined
no tears, just a touched heart
The Montana one is weird.
Ahaha, Montana

That's on one of those shell hosts isn't it?
Yeah
;3
mib_someguy: Kicking the nick does nothing.
Just wait till it disconnects.
all of the servers right now are on shell hosts
u.u
That's weird

How can you forget the nerd? T~T
But those damn thug zombies...
Panama as in Middle Americas?
Or Panama as in Florida.
xD
Ok, I worked out how to fix it.
Well, if we can find cheap/reliable VPSes, we should be able to get the servers from above locations for cheap.
/me brohoofs Luna
If you ctrl + F5 on the theatre page on .net it should work now.
works
<3

thanks
No problem, I'll just update it on the .co.cc site now.
I actually forget about south america a lot
damn!
It's hard not to forget.
Is zis ze HQ of ze herd?
EqD?
Hm... Yeah.
Well
It's pretty much the largest pony HQ/blog/news thing.
Some could argue that Ponychan actually is
Zen... zis is my place
They were supposed to go to QuadraNet, but my contact there is now gone and my good price went away.
Anyway, all fixed now.

I'd offer something in a more central location, but my paying customers come first. :-\

Epic Pony time
Dari updates when EqD updates?
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:20h:57m:58s
XD
Yeah I do.
But anyway, if I buy 3, and Awesomeshy buys 4, we're in good shape.
But it's not set to do that here yet.
I'll set it up, sec.
As long as you've got at least 3 nodes that aren't on cheap shell providers, I think it's all great.
Still posting in the old server.
Ahh.
Oh my
Well, VPSes obv.
I'm buying those three from rapidxen (Probably)
mrponinatro
Yeah I know. :/
Seriously?
yes
?
are you like ponies
Awesome
wait
I am like a pony, yes
;p
you're buying three servers?
I am too.
They $8/piece, yeah
;o
oh... k
Actually
/me I'm not complaining
Not a pony.
yup
my litte pony is movie
Need to find other VPS sites that offer reasonably priced servers from the locations we need.
http://tinyurl.com/3g5xa98
XBox!
wait, are the old servers even still running? irc.bronyserv.co.cc?
Solid marble, magically enhanced, and 99% sentient.
I don't understand why anyone would pay that much money
yep
anyone wanna cry?
I'm here I'm having to pay ~$40 a month
$24/month? :D
And for the record
Iks: If you would like to cry, go ahead.
no i am asking you
Well, if we can get VPSes as cheap as $10 or less, you might get off with less.
/me totally wasn't one of those people
<.< >.>
I'm not feeling that bad, beside having this flu
oh, weird... i tried to connect a few minutes ago and it didn't work. now it does.
No.
ok then i wont link it
blablablabl
http://www.tyea.com
!away
yeah
Link it anyway
What's cessation?
the end
But I think we already talked about that.
you look FOREVERR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no
And only two considering one is a hub.
saico
this
shaico
unless other changes
We need to be bold.
Tricycle Sprinkle?
No, the address, I mean.
I guess that's fair.
I'm thinking
It certainly won't hurt anything.
I'm paying for 4 servers right now
Yes, friend?
irc.bronychat.net
all of them about $12 each
English doesn't seem to be one of his stronger languages, I assume

Grab my tail, Laps|down!
AWAY~
Well, we might be able to find cheaper VPSes.
u_u
Yes, User_3880?
yeah
also
Well
how many users can we fit on 512MB ram
Cheaper == worse
have you ever wanted to roof my litte pony
http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/9123/1298189843774.jpg
Should someone add the "You are in the right place to the topic header"?
nohgtig
But where are linode's servers located?
:C:C
Right place for now.
----dd-
They've got many locations
Ooooookay
Uh
Newark, NJ, USA
;D
I dunno either, Poniator.
Dallas, TX, USA
Fremont, CA, USA
would 2 of the $20 servers hold up with 3k users?
poninator
Where does the extra "n" keep popping up from?
That would be tight.
I suppose if I get those three, it covers Midland, West Coast, and Europe.
6hallo everypony
It's just "Variator", ponified
yeah, I like the dallas idea
heloo
Would give us a server on the four corners and one in Euro land
mrponinator
Yeah?
That seems reasonable.
Ages ago.
2,14 oh yey, no warning!
look this http://www.youtube.com/user/PIFTSdotexe#p/u/3/YdZa2phzWe8
2,14 :D
I'll actually be saving a little money by doing this
Use the Dallas Linode as a US hub?
Probably Chicago.
Pony Thread Simulator v2.0?
sure*
yes
brb
Seen it ages ago
I guess it would be a good idea to use a linode server as the hub, everyone keeps telling me they're where I should go for htis
this*
Between the two, it's kind of a tossup.
oh look, another one of them colored fellers
mrponinator
probably not the best thing to link
Yeah?
Neither one is going to go down or have connectivity problems.
:P
Yep?
6it is good to see all of you here
even if the others are cheaper
If I keep sensing that a little more...
how much resources do you need for a hub in contrast to a leaf?
It's like in movies how they ask "Do you speak English" and still keep talking in English
Hi RP
Even though the person they're talking to doesn't understand any of it
It's all gouda.
I'm definately willing to learn
And level of sense that made is nonexistent
actually wanting to
But bandwidth is going to be abundant with these hosts.
mrponinator
I'm more worried about capping out memory

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Most of the 500-5,000 user networks I see aim for around 100-250 users per node.

Thank you

Mooooooooorning everypony!
well that's pretty unusual for a score program
moornig
/me is slow on the kick
Guys!
?
If we're planning for 1,000 users in the near future, I'd say we go for four second-tier VPSes. That's 250 users per server, assuming there's also a hidden hub.
woo!
512 MB could hold that.
/me pouts
Frustrating
you should try something else
There would probably still be some breathing room, too.
Flutteryay
It's really hard to say without knowing how fast we'll grow
I'm rambling. Sorry.
very helpful rambling

Hmm... well, my music theory teacher did make a passing reference to it but she uses MuseScore
lol
Although

I don't have time to stream right now
:p
6What are you going for dearie? In school I mean
What'cha gonna stream?
I'm majoring in music technology
:O
awesome
The focus is on using a computer.
6Well, yes I understand that. . .
Guitar for me.
Hmm
ahahah really?
6but the Uni I go to, where I am majoring in Piano Performance/Composition, you must have a main instrument
Yeah
xD
I'm hardly an expert on IRC capacity planning.
Daniel Ingram is such an inspiration to me
:3
he's good
My network hit 500-1000 users a few years ago when we were linked with a much larger group.
Eeeeeeyup
Argh, EqD still has the old address.
>movie
yes
And yeah, isn't that like avoiding kicks, User_3880?
no

<Kabaka> If we're planning for 1,000 users in the near future, I'd say we go for four second-tier VPSes. That's 250 users per server, assuming there's also a hidden hub. <--- Well, 5 leafs if you include your's. But that's up to you. :p

You do tracerouting before you link servers right?
If you don't know then no, it was just coincidence lol
That's often a good idea, yes.

Yeah
:p

Who's he?

That laugh is very notoriously known for it
Hopefully we can get the website fully operational and whatnot.
OH
no i'm italian :D
(I know 'cause I'm one of them, just living in the states)

Also, need to find some PR guys in the future.
That'll be interesting.
Yeah.
Also need a TOS of some kind.
Yeah

I really don't go there tbh.
I know people on there.
did you have a bad experience?
That's it.

Why of course.
Ramenshy: Not directly. But their reputation is well-earned.
I just realized that I wore my nightshirt to school XD
6^.~ Our little secret~
Good thing they're like my day shirts.
please explain, I've never cared about rizon to hear anything about them
Ramenshy: I trust you're familiar with their grand ventures of IRC domination and the subsequent jail time, right?
You walk among us mortals...
Luckily it's evening.
Yep
IRC isn't worth that sort of thing.
Hardly any money to be made. xD
hahaha oh wow
Yeah
that they'd do that
It's a money waster.
xD
> Downey faced up to 24 months in prison and a fine of up to $40,000.
Yeah, that's pretty much terrible.
wow
just wow
I don't think anyone has made a way to make cash though IRC.
Well
The providers maybe.
Hosting IRC is tricky.
Nothin' important right now.
Nah, nothing going on here right now
Exactly
Hmm
Quite a few datacenters completely disallow anything even indirectly related to IRC because of that.
x_x

Well I'm in high school but my parents are SERIOUSLY opposed to ponies...

Freenode servers get hammered 24/7

that was an awesome show
Though, he already knows I've some unconventional tastes
u_u
Initial stability is key, though.
2,14 initially, that was just an anti-troll measure
Yeah
It's nicer to be nicer even when all are not nice.
I like to quote one fellow from a talkshow "Uutisvuoto"
It's nice to give people the benefit of the doubt
Showing the show doesn't solve it every time, to be honest
LOL
i prefer the c.s. lewis quote
If they're too fixated on the "childish" aspect, it's not as simple as that
^
is*
"When I became a man, I put away childish things, such as the fear of appearing childish."
I'll be nice to Manson and decline the offer and nicely notify the authorities.
That's a good one too
They say it isn't normal and it's going to isolate me from my friends.
Never did take 100% :(
It's really brilliant
My mum even came back from shopping and told me they had ponies at Tesco the other day.
My parents give me a hard time, but only in jest.
one of my favorite games of all time, most likely
I know, right?
porny*
I think not even FiM would make me tolerate everyone.
We joke a lot anyway.
man I got a C# project to work on
why haven't I done it yet
^
tolerate everyone is impossible
It's just shame that I have bunch of other games waiting to be finished.
I loved RDR.
But the PoP games are probably my favourites.
Or Spyro 1/2/3.
Lol @ MPR|
and I dunno...
Half-Life

Any suggestions?
Define platformer...
Yeah
I had issues with my card last time.
It kept rejecting it for some reaosn.
But that might not work out for you.
reason*
Huh. Annoying.
I have A TON of unfinished games dating back years since purchase.
well, 3D platformers... 2D platformers there are plenty of
Any idea is an idea, and that's more than I have right now.
Something about batch or whatever.
Bleh
Authorization charges can cause that.
u_u
but like Banjo Kazooie, those games border on perfection :(
Plus indie freeware.
I'd just be casual about it, not try to hide it, watch it on TV in the same room as them.
Or the very least, I do not have a bank account.
Thus no verification.
Paypal guest is great.
Don't feel like it. ;cx
Well I don't think I have played proper platformer in ages.
But as I said.
man
That's just me.
bank accounts rule
Totally.

Would Mirror's Edge count as 3D platformer?
Best pony is every pony.
should I sleep or drink coffee
I do like Mirror's Edge a lot, but most of the fun is had in the trial missions
Coffee ho, that website isn't making itself.
xDX
Very much.
xfd right right
story mode... kinda dodgy
I should probably get get back to working on that
anyone feel like making a favacon for me?
as it is, I barely tell my parents anything
To me if you hide it that just makes it seem like something strange, wrong, dirty.
Yeah, doing time trials on those crazy hovering tracks is a whole ton of fun
It's not.
All you're doing is watching a TV show.
Every pony :D
they don't agree with pretty much anything I do.
but seriously uh
When you manage to get through whole level in the "flow" it's fantastic experience.
I tried to get the "test of Faith" trophy on my first run through Mirror's Edge.... definitely wasn't easy :P
I know how you feel, tux...
they still think I'm wasting my time working in IT.
I just plain don't talk to them unless I need to.
Same
Pfft. Never used guns
I played mirror's edge for a bit.
Wasn't that impressed.
and I hate to say it...but sometimes I wish my gf's parents were my parents.
'cos they're awesome
But it's one of those games I actually have come back again and again simply to feel the flow
I'd hope for a Mirror's Edge 2 where they fix all the problems with the first one... but it's not gonna happen
ahahaha
Thanks
probably
They certainly are.
again?

u_u

But that doesn't make money.
That's a bit harsh
I'd hate to spend all that time
kinda sad, because it takes a couple of good games to make a good franchise
Yeah. Money is not everything
Ehh, it's experience, right?
Do I taste good?
Tell Kotick that money isn't everything.
But unfortunately the guys making games are not the guys deciding which games to make
He'll bawl laughing.
anyway, time to go back to catchup on my Accounting
We don't
If you didn't want that to happen, you wouldn't make it opensource.
:P
The guys deciding are ones that may never play games.
Just making money off of a commodity.
well money makes the world go round

But the concept is starting to suck.
But there are a lot of open source freaks out there. ;)
And that's how software licenses are picked :D
Yeah, there really are.

The channel mode to strip control codes also strips it from ops/owners, etc.
+m is bad.
No, I mean like +o and +v
Hello again~
Oh dear... can I share the song that I have stuck in my head...? e-e; It's not bad I promise. It's pony related.
How does +o or +v help?
It differentiates the "mods"
When there are 300 people talking at the same time you don't note immediately the names of whoever is speaking.
Adds a nice little symbol before their name, and lets users decide if they want their client to add extra formatting
Please do, Fluttershy
No on mibbit.
Well then

We have reasons for doing things the way we do. ;)
Well, I think I've already shared in the past, actually... >_> Can't remember. That or you've heard it before but... here goes

I knew it had a following, I just thought they were all crazy losers... no offence
have you used irssi?

Yes. I found it to be lacking. :-\

Yup, a Dr. Suess cartoon about a very stupid capitalist.
I found it to be excellent

Hello.
Hello everypony.
I should give weechat a try then
Hi here.
Aww, why's that?
Possibly.
Yeah, I'm watching too. :3
:)
#weechat is always full of irssi converts.
well I was at my cousin's birthday last night
I don't have the hub :(
I'm pretty sure I have the Hub on my TV at home... not entirely sure yet
it kind of reminded me of how I am kind of pathetic

I only have the episodes downloaded in HD, with zero commercial breaks :(
Haha this anime Futurama is hilarious.
This fashions getting old

it is a console application right
Apparently we get it with our basic cable. :(
Its allright this is my first time watching it on my tv and not my laptop lol
/me hugs Fluttershy back gently. I am alright, a bit sick and stressed with some things but okay for now. How are you? n.n

Yeah. It's similar to irssi in that way.

Shoo be doo?
Winter Wrap Up
-falls over, twitches-
not nessicarily

thatnks the main reason I use irssi. I never saw a point in usinga gui for something that only handles text

If you chose to hang around IRC instead of finding a girlfriend why feel bad about it? Makes no sense.
It's inside tmux, not that it really matters.
you know, you really don't know the theripudic power of ponies untill you get sad

I am willing to tolerate and respect somebody that I might not hold the same values as, if they are willing to respect my values in return

If you can't accept that people just don't like the same things as you and you shouldn't try to force them, you are not tolerant. You are behaving like you are in a cult.

one day I just decided to look up the show and watch it
Pinkie Pie?
after seeing a thread on Spoony's forums
After seeing page after page of ponies
I saw an iPhone app that said it was ment for 18+ males. I was curious and did some reading.
I haven't recommended it to anyone, because I don't know anyone I think would like it.

I read about the characters.
And stopped around episode 16
Then I said: "I gotta see this".

I saw the firs 5 or 6 episodes on a row.

I would never tell her about that
I saw the show under my own behest. No person had to attempt to convince me.
/me cannot remember how pushy his friend was, and the logs are on a different computer :(
I don't recommend everything I happen to like.
she caught me trying to buy a Pinkie Pie and scolded me for it
<Robot%OPinkie>: if anyone wants to add me, my PSN name is RobotPika <- I'll add you when I get home.
sure it was a G3 Pinkie Pie
buy one anyway
I remember the first time I went to buy a Pony toy for myself...

Fluttershy is the only one I'm missing.

its name is ironic, i think.
same./
Something about someone stealing cocaine from their pimp and then running away to sell it before they get caught or something.
6This thing wrote a fanfic? D:
Do ponies have electricity? I've seen ambiguous references in the show.
of course it did
It has a really high IMDb rating.
fanfics are the epitome of laziness and shit
Should be good.
Well.
They have light switches, but we never see a light bulb.
Twilight has that weird contraption
Pretty high anyway.
M-m-m-meow
was that using electricity?
and they have indoor plumbing
then that's even worse
You mean the contraption from Feeling Pinkie Keen?
They've got to have some sort of magical electricity.
That sure looks electrical.
Maybe they channel magic for energy...or have something for electricity.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeow
of course they have electricity
I'm having lunch.
I hate it when ponies put QR codes and shit online
Lawl.
watup!
Hello.
Mmmm
also they have trains pulled by ponies... whats up with that
pretty much
Seems pretty contradictory to me.
Iks, cleaner than coal?
Theny need the engine for the whistle
They*
We do see lights, but there's still a reasonable doubt obout their origins...
And technology in Twilight's basement
you kinda need power and technology to work a set of turntables
the whistle
She could turn the tables by magic, I think... After all she IS a unicorn.
it's intellectually stagnant
MAGITECH
maybe everything works on magical batteries
oh well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgAbLUTb0Lg
I look at it the same way Thor explains Asgard in the comics.
it's Pinkie Pie, we don't have to explain it
Fireflies?
that was probably a pot with a plant before... we know she produces her own inprobability field
You're just using someone else's work.
BeatleBrony, yeah like that
+1 point for BeatleBrony
explains it alot
Time to go!
Bye peoples~
Later
But then again... that's Pinkie.

and those same comics I despise
i did that like 5 times already
No it isn't Val.
I hate a_lot of fanart
6It makes me want to say yes to his interview.
Iks, yeah but I just noticed that last one...lol
XD
05now i take offence
05:C
Hello, everypony! :)
How's everyone? o 3o
yo!
Hi there.
do you make comics filled with only vectored images from the show?
They aren't equivalent Val.
05no i make comics filled with vectors that ive drawn based of canon content
Bai
05close enough to hurt me feelin's
Then they would be equivalent.
/me hugs everypony
brb
even if you are right on that one point dari, the fact remains that there is not a single fanfic that is quality literature
Alright, random poll
A poll you say
05define the definition of quality litterature
Ask away.
Go on, friend.
I'll give you two, either of which you may take
I'm reading one right now
the last one....?
1) Something I would enjoy reading
Cross and arrow
The most recent one
Pizza
Hayseed.
nowait Cross and Arrow
2) Something that (had it not been a fanfic) could be published
Exactly one week until Season 2. :3
I've only read one lol
I don't remember its name
Hoenshy
!s2
Season 2 begins in 7d:18h:22m:52s
!s3
I need 1.21 gigamuffins to find that out for you.
!s4
I don't keep track of that...
last fanfic... something winds burning hearts
!s1
!movie
Iks, frigid
It was average.-
yes
I'm pretty sure there's a LOT of 2 around.
Since there's a lot of crappy published books.
prove it
:(
9so we switched the Dinkypage to uStream Emergency Broadcast System for tonight
woohoo lol
I'm not talking about self-published books
I'm talking about books that actually have to go through a PUBLISHER
why is that? :O
9as in
2,14 because the people at Veemi are evil
9our stream provider
9is dying
Sorry, guys, but I have to get going now.
Actually, I have to go like 5 minutes ago...
later
051/2, bueno
:O
:/
It was nice talking to you all.
Have a nice day.
but cant seem to get myself to read it
There's lot of crappy books published by publishers.
lots*
such as?
T_T
saturday 17
T_T
!moon
Grab my tail, wolfinponysclothing!
Okey-doke.
I'd be willing to argue the books you're talking about are just not enjoyable to you, yet are still very well written
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
yeah me too T_T
yes BUT
Kkat does an excellent job
#bronystate won't be there

:D
Time for sleep. Night, ponies.
I just remembered when Pinkie got the full doozy combo
:')
And briefly turned into a blimp
i wish they would make more isometric games..

6Goodnight Kabaka~
O.o
2,14 false
:)
-_-
That's a long freakin' shift.
yep
05in other words, pointless discussion
05it comes down to personal preference
heh
Still a damn long shift.
I can abide by that consensus, as much as I am inclined to disagree with it :"P
It becomes more of a character study
:P*
Damn.
i hope i can get a break of 20 minutes
and watch the episode with you all
Some of those memory orbs and recordings really punch you in the gut
in a good way
Heck yes. It's easy to think of the Mane 6 to be a bit OOC at first. When you've just received a glimps or two of them. But the more you read, the more it all makes sense.
Yes^
like gerald celente calls em... Harvard, Princeton, Yale. Bullets, Bombs and Banks.
And the OCs are incredibly well done too
05now
05back to drawing rainbow dash
I haven't gotten that far into it yet, still in chapter 1
kewl
keep going
"I'm a year older than you..."
haha

lol
How many ponies here have read past sins?
i trew it on the ground!
i did
I have
Best pony.
i liked it
kewl
Great story
05streamign it aswell
PenStroke did an excellent job with the end
I felt that I could never be satisfied with the end, but he managed to pull it out and make it work
I think Celestia was a touch out of character
But that's probably my biggest gripe
well she was more out of character in the first version
on my initial readthrough, I didn't think it was too bad
I could feel she had regret
sister should be italics
word of note:she banished her permanently
to emphasise
exactly
"happy"
a published author would never write a fanfic :P
Celestia is sad pony :(
yes
Lawl.
Wrong.
but hey, I'll be reasonable
I've seen fanfics by published authors before.
such as?
we're never sad
this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ
we're not allowed to be.
There was some massively long Eragon fanfic I saw a long time ago, didn't read it, because I don't read fanfics.
PONIES MAKE ME SSAD
:(
I wish I was in a sadfic mood when I read that
But the author got published, which is why they stopped writing fanfics.
Oh dear.
I only cry when I'm in a sadfic mood
I practically shed tears
>which is why they stopped writing fanfics
I had tears welling and a wasn't in a sadfic mood
but hey, I'll be reasonable here
It was because they no longer had the free time to devote to it.
show me a fanfic that's good
i allowed myself to shed a few tears
and I'll take everything back
and hah, that's such bullshit it makes me want to laugh
Texas Wildfires
I need to get myself in a sadfic mood whenever I read a fic
then they're completely full of themselves
Spreaded over 15000 acres.
Lawl.
lol
The most recent chapter of FO:E had an excellent scene thatwould have had me bawling
but I just wasn't in the mood for it
are we in a net split?
netsplit *
(darn autocorrect)
You don't WANT to like them in the first place.
There's nothing I can show you good or not that you'd say you enjoyed.
Now it's a full-on war on mistreating loyal consumers.
that's actually completely bullshit
Also, I don't know any fanfics.
because before I actually READ fanfics, I was intrigued by the idea
I have since then had my eyes opened

Origin is good for competition, but it's from a company that isn't popular with fans for good reasons.

Hi
I don't think it's for competition, really...
hi
I have it
it doesn't change the fact that you can do reasonably well with practice
But Valve has never been cruel to it's customers.

bye everypony
:D
Aaahahaha

Oh I thought that was my Skype XD
bye :3
oh, stream's going?
6You are hacking the picture D:
05?
back!
6You are too good, how do I quit you?!
oh wow
uStream doesn't allow for rezising
how faggy
Honestly, I wouldn't mind if they banned a few more people from the DA2 forums. Maybe some from the Mass Effect forums as well. >_>
05and i can do fairly realistic
05jsut not in vector
The DA2 bans were for the games.
Some of the realism artists just blow me away.
My head just explodes.
I am aware of this.
05indeed
05latest pinkamena for an examble
05p*
damn i never realized how bad seaquest was... at least season 2
05those guys are isnane
And my head just fucking explodes.
it's even crazier when they hand paint it
I only watched one episode of it, and that's because I had a crush on Jonathan Brandis.
well, it's often like that
i recently played tales of symphonia with a friend
They don't have the right.
Huh. Chantelise.
now i think it's one of the dumbest things ever
How come?
They shouldn't have that right, but that's another thing
mostly because of the characters
Even if they do/did have the right to do that, suspending someone for stating an opinion doesn't look good.
Yeah, pretty stereotypical JRPG characters
That's not right.
also, the whole situation itself
A forum suspension, yes.
6I need to find that picture, a brushed Rainbow Dash in the clouds
Because not everyone knows about it
That end product is a photo, I SWEAR IT!
they're like "Oh well. Time for some unfunny jokes!"
Apple won't close my iTunes account if I send them an angry letter.
yes, well, but they DO know about those stupid farms, which are basically concentration camps
MFW that only took 5.5 hours.
Or stop me from listening my music.
The modern AAA gaming industry is crap.
i know; i didn't mean to imply there weren't any
You don't own anything anymore.
Generally Tales of series isn't that special
Well, that's the problem with software copyright laws.
Except for their fun battle system
6. . . This song. . . . 3:
05its the hair dari
05the hair fools you
How the fuck does he do the hair?
O____________o
like this
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=josw4pxJcsc
It's...
IMPOSSIBRU!
I agree that it sucks, and it shouldn't be legal
Yeah.
05also
I think there should be legislation against draconian DRM.
05put'
Yeah.
yes
/me explodes.
whats that Oo
Even the single strands of hair look like they're from a photo.
But oh well
How does he do it? O__o
That's also one thing that really pisses me off
05a paintbrush
Can't help that tales of symphonia is one of the only JRPGs on GC, LvS
0This is going to be a very painful two hours...
yeah, well, doesn't really matter nowadays.
6I'd like to make myself believe Equestria's, kind, puuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhnnnneeeeeee~~~
That cat.
Seriously.
I gotta play Baiten Kaitos someday
NO
I thought it was a photo until I remembered seeing him draw it.
Don't ever play that
it's AWFUL.
How come?
05fittign wallpaper aswell
While we're on the topic of odd-sounding games
well, the story is stupid
but they NEVER do that when it'd be useful
one reason I prefer consoles, really
!moon
Grab my tail, Charlie_Horse!
Are you fucking shitting me?
05ok time for fucking epic
The cat was only TWO HOURS.
And these are only story-related issues?
tales of symphonia was fun
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
They lied about the DRM on "From Dust."
well, mostly
I mean I know there are some XBLA and PSN titles with shitty DRM, but if you buy a disc you buy a disc, and that's that.
I never beat it though, I can never beat most single player rpg's =/
GGgala, really man? How many do you need?!
I refuse to accept that that is drawn.
It's not possible.
lol, u mad dari?
I doubt it sinks to the level of Tales of Eternia

hurhur
It's a QR code link I looked at earlier
See ya, Fluttershy

Could've been worse considering you linked something from Johnjoseco
Anyone know a good torrent with pony musics?
now that's a great rpg.

Also Wednesday.
well, okay, that depends, i guess
probably just wasn't for me
hei mrponinator
For me, at least
mrponinator
Yeah?
i felt that way about Mana Khemia
se oon mä
ok ok
all the time i was like, "Well, this can't possibly get any dumber"
Also, no matter how much people seem to like Persona 4, I don't find it that special
i've never played persona...
And Legend of Dragoon
YES
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Looks good.
Not really that special plot, but the gameplay is pretty darn great
A million times over yes
The best dungeons in any JRPG, period
in my opinion, the jrpg with the best story ever is Suikoden 2
05here goes then
JRPGs were good when I was young and had the patience to play the same dang battle a million times over.
*drool*
Suikoden 3 I've never played, Suikoden 4 was okay, and I've not played 5 either
I'm yet to play a Suidoken title
Luc... I think.
......
Luc?
.......
Luc?
why not?
But in terms of story in JRPGs, I'd say that something like Valkyrie Profile is there
Ugh
Valkyrie Profile
Surely
Especially Silmeria
but my favorite Stars are
1: Pahn
2: Viktor
The DS Valkyrie Profile title wasn't that bad either
Lenneth?
I heard mixed things about it.
VP: Lenneth is a port of the PS1 VP to PSP
lenneth is terrible
and it's the only one i played
Silmeria is amazing.
Hey.
Have I shown you guys my cat before?
Give Silmeria a try.
Not that I am aware of.
Or Star Ocean
Star Ocean Till the End Of Time
Even though I never beat it
Though, I do admit that it can be kinda weird
Ooh.
I'll upload a picture.
Or pretty darn unconventional
bbbbbbb
lenneth was confusing, and that whole episodic thing made it pretty much impossible to explore freely
Meh.
I also have a cat pic if you want to see it.
and WHY
Of my cat.
are there SAMURAIS
Oh well.

Let's see if they believe it. XD

hi
Hello everyone
Hello
05hehe
I'm on Dinkypage and all I get is a repeat of earlier with the Skype noises...
Just chillin'
If it is delayed for any reason
I'd probably explode and then explode again
can you do that?
And thus you prove you can explode twice
is it always like that?
Boy, Pinkie is all over these parts.
it just went pubic yesterday
I can't wait to tell her!
oh
no sound?
Hmm
6<3*
No sound.
SOUND?
there's supposed to be a stream?
Then you should feel bad, and draw more Dash to make up for it.
:P
6and Dari, you troll~
I hear strange beeping noises.
6Though that kitty looks SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO real o.o
There'll be about 200-300 people in around 1 1/2 hours
Oh yeah, Boktai is rather unconventional
my friend tried to play boktai on an emulator
guess why that didn't work.
they put bronychan.net
...
The stream isn't up on either page for me...
!moon
Yeah.
Grab my tail, Solarstorm!
Suppose he didn't bother to get a cracked version
I was wondering why it was bronychan.
yeah, offline for me
lol ya
saw that in a comment
aye
but its cool though, we caught it pretty fast
Boktai was fun
I have no idea
Until I wound up with sun poisoning from it
I could nod and watch my forehead wobble
05what gives it away is the enviroment

its getting darker everywhere on the northern hemisphere
Yes.
But eh, I like winter

I don't have any pics yet, one of them is sick :(
maybe I'll get some more on tuesday
Random: I've been thinking of how they'd hold magic contests in Equestria. Skill competitions and the like. It's surprisingly hard. Tournament style contests works, but I find that to be way too limiting.
season not series
Series for me.
I'm in the UK.
We're picking them up tomorrow

Heh
I'm still not seeing the stream... Going to refresh
Alrighty, that's cool
welcome to the herd!
/me watches schadenpony
Yes, Welcome to the herd.
Is the stream actually up? On Dinkypage I just see the UStream recording, on co.cc it says "Offline"...
o.o
05i second that idea
I'll at least idle in both
http://miburl.com/TaEpI1 <-- My cat.
cause IRC, it is made for idling!
oh
And careful of some of the fanfic
Some of it is DEMENTED
Like that one my friend tells me about staring Pinkie?
D'awwww~ XD
i dont usually idle though, i wait around and convers with people
That's one cute fur pile
which is why i hope lots of ponies come
You know, if you don't want people to read some fanfic, why is it necessary to bring them up every now and then?
well, can't be active in all my channels at once
Heh... it's attacking my chair right now. It was even cuter as a kitten...
http://miburl.com/GU9Fxx <-- Kitten pic
just be sure to come by us often ;D
brb, gonna feed it.
I just said their names
Same reason you look down when ponies tell you not to
I don't want them to accidentally stumble onto them and get mentally scarred
You're being too sappy Stomper.
Ugh, Accounting book is not the best reading in the world.
