Applejack2012: Throw the Sea Ponies in there as well
Yep

RD wears a wig.

busy getting kicked :(
Nope
and sea ponies
RD went bald for a second
how does it stay on at mach speed then Meanwhile?
It's a bald cap for when she puts on her cosplay wig.
Combustiblelemons: Industrial strength glue.
Spoiler: RD dyes her hair!
idk about seaponies, it kind of might be mistaken for apartheid
the rat
Clever... clever.
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!
kaboom
Clever girl

drphantom: Yep: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/J.E.Smith/cancerdash2.png
is Darings VA Ashleigh Ball too?
Couldn't she just go around the trap?
Just walk along the side :)
rats will actually hunt and eat mice...
flutterchu: SHe's basically a monocolor RD.
yeah
if she was clever she would have put a stone there first^^
Fl00t4hSh41: thatd be boring
surprise! no safe tiles
Alchemist, I've been wondering yesterday about who voiced Daring Doo
but in the latin alphabet, jehova starts with an i
She's smarter too.
Want it need it
Tassadork perhaps she meant to ponies?
So has an Indy/Daring/Lara crossover fanfic been written yet?
How about all are big except for rats lol
flutterchu: Basically yes, it's a recolor......but her cutie mark is a compass
suddenly, lava.
CrimsonPhoenix: She sounds a bit like RD so I assume its Ashleigh
USE THE MOUTH
Nyst: I know an indy/daring crossover
Suddenly Magma!
and an indy/lara crossover
Whats the point of having a sacred treasure if it will bur up
Alchemist, as far as I can remember Daring had another VA
but not all three

HEALTHCARE FRAUD
You know I had the same thing when I was in the hospital as a kid. Except it was a videotape of a cartoon. I watched it again and again and wished I could take it home with me when I left.

What am I gonna doo?
INB4 SNAKE MODE
:trollface:

The credits never show the full cast.
Metal gear time.
Quick_Thinker: They usually don't change the credits and just have the main cast
Metal Gear.

Quick_Thinker Chiara Zanni,she also voiced Twist
well thats buckin cheap
Metal solid gear
J_E_Smith71: I know, but them being tiny is more distracting for me
Quick_Thinker, they don't show the credit for minor voice role
I love her big eyes
Even deLancie didn't get credited either
RD squee
Squee
SQUEE <3 :D

Why do they need guards here? Are the slippers that valuble?
HELP

Ah, break time.
SILENCE!!!!! oh---no lottery
So we have full 20 mins today?
Lotto was yestrday
Lottery has already been made

I'd say it's like sweeping floors for a living
<.<

Thank god
^^

Aww I missed the lottery? :(
pain
and cards
So no +m unless they have an announcement
Vordox: was yesterday
many many many many cards
I always miss the lottery.
i dont enjoy reading
Always
Bogy: Yu-Gi-Oh
Combustiblelemons: implying theres a currency in equestria, and that bits are really used for much of anything
i love it when all the enforcers are afk or asleep
English or Japanese?
intermisson wut
Pony episode just finished I take it?
oh... okay.... the motorsycle yu gi oh or the "normal" one?
i already bitched about yu gi yestery TIME TO DO IT AGAIN WITH STYLEEEEEEE
what, they just give out houses free?
^^
Combustiblelemons: probably
pony_1072: English
yo Soulero, ahem Sumica
Inb4 you activated my trap card.
hello
Combustiblelemons: maybe in larger cities, the bits are actually useful
sonicdude558 huh?
00,10hmmmm?
Hi, weegee2062. :)
... let me go to equestria. NOW.
Pass... 4Kids ruins it
hi
Sumica is a mod
hi
00,10me what?
I just realized something. In Cutie Mark Chronicles, they all get their marks when RD does her rainboom. But for Applejack it is morning, while it is evening for Pinkie.
Combustiblelemons: in the smaller communes they all likely just work ffor free
11,01~yay~
pony_1072: But it's fun as hell to make fun of in chat
Quick_Thinker: i'll join too! No critic should go on this movie ALONE
sonicdude558 what have i done?
so... where do they get money for food?
nothing
LETS DO IT DARK HIGH HOOF
RainbowAsh: Not really-- it's more the rock farm is overcast. ALWAYS.
I thought you said that you love it when the mods are asleep
/)
next is yu-gi-oh?
no
http://i.imgur.com/kzcb3.jpg
Quick_Thinker: /)
Combustiblelemons: well, they still have money, but they dont really need it, because everyone gives everything away for free, unless they really need money
ok
mods asleep post ponies
prepare your trapcard ponies
Dark92Enigma: he meant you4
Combustiblelemons: as demonstrated in the show
sonicdude558 apb reloaded is a game
http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=twilightsparkle_zps09df33c2.png
ANYWAYS. For those who missed lotto yesterday. Winners were King's Speech and Powerpuff Girls Movie. Pony eps are Dragon Quest and Sonic Rainboom
RainbowAsh: Different towns, different time slot, i guess
cause this is going to be one heck of a rollercoaster
never mind Sumica, sorry for waking u up
lol
that high hoof was for dark but what evs Austin /)
http://i.imgur.com/GSloF.jpg
:)
Dark_Horst: you4? for what?
Kencolt, maybe, but the family goes into the farm house just before the rainboom and don't come out until the next morning.
Quick_Thinker: theres enough brohoofs to go around
So Equestria is some sort of communist-democracy-monarchy?
Oh Meanwhile, what have you done
flutterchu: lol
Quick_Thinker: /)
yes austin yes there are
Dark92Enigma: i knew you'd do that
http://i48.tinypic.com/2wf0pwh.jpg
BUFFER! NOT THE BUFFER!
wheres superbrony64?
Combustiblelemons: its not really any established form of government, but yeah you can call it that
OMC BRONIES! I WAS ON MAMAMEDIA.COM AND IT'S STILL ONLINE!
Dark92Enigma: hey, laptop keaboard, not much space between enter and the numblock
Dark92Enigma, different time zones like that would mean Equestria was huge
Dark_Horst: i'm in a good mood today
Combustiblelemons: Equestria is a MAGICAL KINGDOM. POlitics are irrelevant.
RainbowAsh: yes, it is
00,10that is a fail bingo chat, the center is not free.
politics are always relevant.
Combustiblelemons: Socialist Democratic constitutional Monarchy? Like half of scandinavia?
oh noes the room has turned into wannabe mods
11,01Equestria has an absolute monarchy (though it's a rule of two) for a govt. and what seems to be a capitalist economic system.
I always considered moving to Norway or somewhere near there Fl00t4hSh41
Ok, Austin if you want, you can join us
I love this song :)
well i guess me and Dark92Enigma are your two offical critics of the movie since i already saw it and am a fan of yu gi so i'd be perfect to rip on it
Now it's a serious consideration.
4.1%
so much speed
Combustiblelemons: Norway would certainly be near scandinavia
nopony cares about what i said
Correct.
oh man.. *notice to myself: bring popcorn for next week*
^^
Combustiblelemons: Watch out for the local Viking tribes
kidzrul434 i do
well, theres no real monarchy, as the leaders dont die, and the only economy we've seen so far only uses money when they buy things that are seasonal products, or out of their commune.
Combustiblelemons: they like to go raiding
isnt it great being a nerd though
I'll be sure to enroll for some pillaging and fun.
Cricket Cricket
^ what game are u talking about
I sad that Mamamedia.com is still online!
Quick_Thinker: life
behold: Ogre
i see
i don't know the geography of northern europe ok :S
Combustiblelemons: That it is...
i fail at this game but any other game i rock at :D
Dark92Enigma: I used to have on of those
Combustiblelemons: The Irish usually get all uppity about their monestaries being burnt though...
what?
I bought the DVD solely for the BESD
you mean blue eyes shinging dragon? well stop looking its only worth *checks ebay* 3.50
Thought they were mad because northern ireland's not theirs any more.
Quick_Thinker: i digress, i was quite a great player back in the day.....the anime was awesome, and the manga was, you guessed it.....AWESOME!
Combustiblelemons: When they leave a convent full of silver, guarded by nuns in the middle of nowhere
Combustiblelemons: And then they get all indignant when you loot the place
BESD is worthless now because the Yu-gi-oh franchise has to continue to make stuff more and more OP until rediculessness occurs
wow the chat is getting pretty slow :(
Fl00t4hSh41: ok, so we're talking about medieval europe then...
Combustiblelemons: I'm not sure what they think would happen when they do that....
Well they should have guards.
i got my BESD from an epic duel against um well this going to sound crazy but slavery for a year so i got a awesome card if i won but i would be personal slave if i lost
yet its also somewhat collectable
Quick_Thinker: thats rediculous
that right there was some bad thinking from our irish friends.
sonicdude558: That's cause during intermission people do sensible things like going to the bathroom.
sonicdude558 its slow thanks to intermission everyone is getting popcorn
oh ok
Wait how did we get from a discussion of the economics of equestria to pillaging ireland?
Quick_Thinker: it's AVAILABLE? (cue Ode Of Joy)
sorry guys
gotta go
no clue just roll with it
work is calling
bye otakon
Bye, otakon. :)
bye otakon
have fun doing work :P
:(
what AVAILABLE?
Combustiblelemons: Vikings are just awesome that way
ValtheJean: thanks for the stream man
Ding ding ding dinner's done
Because Vikings... As good a reason as any.
Combustiblelemons: That kind of thing happenes a lot here. Heck, Ireland, I'm surpised no-one mentioned potatoes and immigration-- wait, I just did.
Bow bow bow bow bow
Meanwhile: yes Meanwhile ?
Quick_Thinker: the Blue Eyed Shining Dragon that is 3.50 in eBay
oh yeah and guys before i forget im learning how to use steams game maker and im planning on making a pony game
I've been thinking of doing a bronystate shirt

cowvarkian: I know that you know.
Meanwhile: I know
He knows.

NewSuperBronyU

Combustiblelemons: Not in weeks.

I miss his shenanigans.
oh yeah and never do a duel they call a bi suki con (its a yu gi oh duel where you lose they light your deck on fire)
oh god were you there when he face-cammed/ did a dramatic reading?
Like when he tripped over his computer cable and took stream offline live on webcam.
Quick_Thinker: can you just leave, and not get your deck lit on fire?
I've never laughed so hard in my life.
what do you think i did
i won
Combustiblelemons: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54493344/jimmies.png
Quick_Thinker: but if you lose, can you just leave
damn i love his beard
it's so... fuzzy...
and got to have the technially honor of lighting ... an 8yrs deck on fire ... i couldnt do it

The King's Speech is pretty good.Not great,shouldn't have won so many oscars,but it's entertaining,and the acting is great.

11,01A bolt of lightning helped him solve it?
this movice was neveer to happen and 3 years it did

/me in Egypt...
thanks to 4kids

dat hair
they found it was a secret bondage lair
Glitch, http://i.imgur.com/kzcb3.jpg
/me NEWBIE: Wasn’t Anubis in that movie with Brendan Freiser?
worst part about the anime is how there's little of Yugi mindcrushing people
bondage?
it glowed
dont ask lemosn
Why is a kid even allowed to touch thousands years old egyptian artefacts with his bare hands?
honestly that puzzle never looked too complicated
okay let me point out now im typing fast so sorry for spelling mistakes
yay i solved a nine piece puzzle xD
nyst: his hair opens all doors.
Theres like 20 pieces
How did he come into possession of this ancient puzzle?
I know right? I could do a puzzle like that in my sleep!
the last piecce in the anime was thrown into a river
Nyst: Same reason why no one solved that puzzle in 5000 years
okay, let's sum up. the protagonist is a 10 year old kid in bondage gear with the voice of a 20 year old and a thing for ridiculusly large jewelry
People in egyptian times obviously were idiots...:P
ded
Reactor his grandpa stole it from a tumb
I love it how he doesn't care at all about the glowy light thing.
yep, nothing weird here
nice going dude, you killed em'
lag. Much lag.
So basically Yugi directly caused the death of those researchers
Dat overdramatic music :S
Why not distribute the puzzle pieces across the sea?
Iwa: YOu saw what they did to that priest in The Mummy
Ded
Being crushed to death by rocks. You know, for kids.
that way, noone will ever find it.
Why not sink them to the bottom of the sea?
UUUUUULTRA ded
You'd think the archeologists would know egyptian.
Ded you know for kids
Iwa: Gave him a grudge against them and then gave him superpowers
I heard "ankh"
he summoned cthulhu
for 5000 years it was locked away until some kid with too much hairgel put the puzzle together the exacct ame time as these smucks discover a cave COINCIDENCE
well done kid.
satanic tongues, you know, for kids
great
some people like popped collars... Yugi likes dog collars.
It's going to turn him into a supersayan.
Fl00t4hSh41: Exactly :)
GREAT JOB YOU UNLEASHED HELL
OH GAWD A KURIBOH
KURIBOH OH GOD
littlekuriboh ftw
AN ENTIRE ARMY OF MONSTERS SURROUNDS HIM, and HE’S SCARED OF A KURIBOH! :D
it's just a little kuriboh
oh hi KIRRBOH
YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
hi
I never got why he says that.
YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH

title drop, already?
11,01So is this movie Hellraiser for kids?
i miss the oringal shadow games
Dat title drop

PUSSY HAIR GEL POWER ACTIAVE
Warning this movie contains Dan Green
DAT VOICE
gtfo little kuriboh
Puberty hit that kid pretty hard
11,01Because that was a movie about a puzzle unleashing evil.
WE GET IT NARRATOR
Reactor: or orgasm?
So, uh, he screams the name of some card game when he unleashes the power of the amulet?
now he's a 20 year old in bondage gear who sounds like a 50 year old
/me NEWBIE: Who are you!?
Why exactly is that?
Way to doom the world, Yugi!
ohh speaking of which, there must be an abirdged movie of this
still a thing for ridiculously large jewelry
apparently demonic possession dramatically speeds up puberty
OOoooooo
man i wish i could talk over this moviee and be heard instead of typing this shit out
THIS IS OUR MOVIE
fun fact the voice of the pharoh also is the voice of the dad in the 3rd pokemon movie
pony_972: No, the card game is called Duel Monsters. :P
IT IS
Oh.
in the 3 years since this show
a movie was made
He cheats
Poor pyramids. They sure get abused by everything sci-fi or fantasy.
Why does everyone dress in such silly outfits?
card games are serious business
oh hey looks its the chick we will never see again and only seen in the show
Well that's a stupid narration, it's because he cheats his ass off. THAT is why he wins
HI
I think even the power rangers had a pyramid robot once.
I think Japan's anime is bleeding over into reality with their ridic hairdos
Fl00t4hSh41: because anime
My boobs are too big for this movie
And whats with those haircuts?
because anime Fl00t4hSh41
So, how did they go from unleashed artifact to those duel games?
Is the reason that he is good, or does he win because his deck is overpowered? Oh, I don't know...
Oh yeah, they forgot to mention that Yugi became King Of Games…… by DEFEATING MAXIMILIAN PEGASUS!
It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d - duel.
IT WAS THE HEART OF THE CARDS HEART OF SPADES
"heart of the card"
great
THAT'S A HUGE PLOT HOLE RIGHT THERE
can anyone stop yugi moto, and hs unstopable hair?

"Power is NOTHING"
Infinite attack power. You mad.
Infinite Attack?
lolol
"GOES INFINITE BITCH"
so their powers it get more attack points
POWER OVERWHELMING
Hello!
and this kids is why the Egyptian cards are banned from tournys
Shame they never made the game MTG, then at least I could follow what they were doing.
alexxm: Technically, this is legit. In theory. >_>
SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF YUGI
Like I said. He cheats.
/me gets INFINITE DEFENSE
There's more to power than attack power! So, I'll proceed to make my attack power infinite!
hax
My logic holds!
i wonder if i another world there's an anime based off of poker. "BY PLACING MY TREE THREES ALONG SIDE MY TWO SEVENS, I ACTIVATE THE POWER OF THE FULL HOUSE!"

-----This was a simulation the whole time? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
Unbalanced much?
how is a system overloading from that
Night, DaringDerpy. :)
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
smoking computers? must be Dell
so running a simulation breaks the simulator. i'd say your design is flawed
cya
Uuuu.
Not even scientists can figure out a cardgame.
Night DaringDerpy
Calculations? "1+1+1=1, now we'll win for sure!"
uahhhhuuhauhauhh
my "system" only overloads on things like ARMA 2 explosions
me I’m gonna call the FBI, the FCC, the CIA, but first and foremost, you are FIRED!!!
nite DaringDerpy
Whaddya mean "as usual"? you always lose.
bye DaringDerpy
I prefer littlekuribohs version.
I don't understand how anyone would think that could beat a setup with an monster that can get infinite strength. Though, it feels like this is a rather dumbed down strategy
Start looking in Egypt?
There is, Seto. Just beat him up and steal the cards.
Wavy cloak in a closed building...Anime.
i know use Black hole
Moron.
Meanwhile, he tries. Give him credit.
Why would you do that lol
fissure
Well if there isn't then the game would be horribly imbalanced.

pony_300, are there no creature killing cards in yugioh?
OH HI GUY WHO GETS NO EXPLAINTION OF WHO HE IS
SPAH AROUND HERE
But Kaiba's company basically makes all the cards right?
because it wasn't working.
hint his name is pegasus
CriticKitten: That's been tried. Didn't end well.
It had severe water damage
spah sappin' mah memories
Kaiba is way too hung up on this card game. Maybe he should take up tennis instead.
Why doesn't he just make new and more powerful cards?
he created the card game
It's that one guy that no one who hasn't seen this show knows!
OMG IT'S THE LADY OF WATER
why not use exodia , it was good enough in season 1
so the iso displaced the water
and cleaned it out a bit.
O NO IMA VAMPIRE!
oh ok
FABULOUS!
But its basically an ipod now without wifi.
Mom! Buy me that card!

horrible?
/me looks at the yugioh wallscroll in his cloest
more what the hell
TrixieMuffins: Yugi lost those cards, IIRC
Meowth that's right jame... i mean pegasus
dream about a card game = nightmare
that was a nightmare?
Wine Spritzer? I thought this was a kids movie?
he should have my dreams....
LAWL
augh! my depth perception
Pfffhahahaa, wine spritzers
alexxm: more like a PREMONITION
Yes, Yugi will continue to win tournaments by cheating. Terrible!
pony_300, I see. That is overpowered
I wonder what it looks like under Pegasus's hair
is this a yugi-oh movie?
yes
Something wicked this way comes.
Dragon1029: yep it is
PLOT POINT!
I'm pretty sure that the whole "Pyramid of Light is able to block the God Cards" thing is just the writers trying to bail themselves out of having to figure out how Yugi could possibly lose with the three most powerful cards in existence all in his deck.
YES PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR EYE ORRRRRRR JUST SAY IT AND NOWTHING ELSE GREAT JOB explaining it to newcomers GREAT FUCKIN JOB

What does this scene have to do with anything?
CRAPPY SONG GO
You gotta love the soundtrack……..:|
they can't see the future, but they can sense it. :U

Especially card games that you take way too seriously anyway.
That dialogue...
Boresight mode ?
Meanwhile There is nothing more useful than card games
NO I THINK YOU DONT HAVE IT ALL
00,10it's so tough being kiba
and yet the way the god cards really were beaten was totally cheesy in the anime. It was like a the equivilent of taking advantage of a glitch
Lil_B: winning every game before yu gi
Money well spent
INSERT NON-TACTICAL MUSIC
XD
man the lyrics make kabi seem to be wanting friends
08,01this song sounds like AcousticBrony's Loyaly
CriticKitten it does, god cards have no description therefore i can destroy them with black hole
Fuck it, i'm gonna play a more decent song: I WENT THROUGH THE DAAAANGER ZONE
screw aero dynamics, i have money!

Oh great.
Wasn't there even a Black Eyed Peas Song somewhere on the Soundtrack for this movie?
Yeah I bet having enough money to have a personal jet in the shape of your favourite playing card must be real tough on the nerves.
How about a massage? :D

Sumica: That voice reminds me of James from Pokemon
I thought the egyptians made the game?
Sumica and the he lost it
this sounds like some kind of abridged fan dub :/
card games: srs bsnss
Vordox thats becuase it is
00,10it is James
He made the cards. Not the game. Again, later canon explains. :p
is this really the original?
08,01this is the first time i've seen the real YuGiOh
00,10and the other one is brock
Sumica: Oh mai, voice sense tingling
LET ME SEE YOUR MISSING EYEHOLE
08,01and man, littlekurriboh has some of these voices down really fucking well
00,10how odd.
my thoughts exactly
in our world these cards are worth about .25 cents
There weren't.
By the way, there’s another common flaw in this movie. I want you guys to point it out:
woah how funny
Which Yu-Gi-Oh movie is this?
this brooklyn accent makes it hard to concentrate
the first one
and not a single girl on that crowd
inb4 someone shoots Yugi and wins the world
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, except for Tea
im still confused why no one wants TO STEAL THEM
inb4 pointless 3 minutes of movie
Still no luck, keep trying!
nice job just shouting that
lets shout it out real loud so everyone can hear
ASoftFluffyThing the dueling nerd crowd not yugi's friends
AJIsAwesome but we are still in the 90 first pointless minutes
nobodies
wait a second... what movie is gonna be playing?
Nobody^4
is that a mexican wrestler in the crowd ?
brooklyn rage~
Quick_Thinker: well at least in this series there is a reason people don't steal from yugi: the pharoah will fuck them up
wat?
SO MUCH PUNS
i don't get it
Best. Dialogue. Ever.
BROOKLYN RAGE.
XD
:D
oH, Everyone will get the GODFATHER reference!
The dialogue
THAT WAS TERRILE
....
:D
So bad
puns aren't funny, mayor
wow this dub is bad
Oh dear.
00,10damn those things must be heavy
XD
after this series however, wh ynobody ever beats the shit out of the main character and steal their cards I dunno. Here, the pharoah might mindcrush you. In the other series... dunno.
....
See not a single girl
WHAT.
HELLO NUR OWWW

Hoh my god her wee we go again
Welp.
OH MAI
Holla everypony! :)

I play the fanservice card

/me stares at the vast collection of yugioh card
he looks like mr white from venture bros.
Discord?
a world of pain!
A world of Discord!
CHAOS!
wat
A world that can be easily destroyed in the actual game!
WHO FRAMED ROGAR RABBIT
Pegasus and his bloomin' Toon deck.
There's no ponies.
I guess the one advantage of GX over this is that Yuma is more proactive. That's about the only point I'll give to that otherwise horrid series.
play toon is very dangerous, because if you don't pick the toon world, all your deck is useless
Not a legit card.
You know what's sad, Sumica ... This is a % game... "ESport with %" <--- Guess what... Boring =P
*yawn*
Those 'shadow monsters' don't really look too threatening.
they need to make more toon cards
Quick_Thinker: Not that toon world, God knows it's more entertaining than this movie, though
TIME TO DO A BS STRATUGY
EPIC MUSIC FOR JUST PUTTING A CARD DOWN! SO EPIC!
That's because it doesn't have enough Exodia. Or Motorcycles.
Oh wait a minute I know...before I've even drawn the card...
Exodia on motorcycles?
Wooow....creepy background...but i love the creepy things, oh yea..Hi
what are the rules of these battles? This is REALLY confusing!!
why show the cards its more fun to be surprised

Quick_Thinker They figure it out eventually
MTG used to have something similiar in early editions, but no one ever wanted to play that way.
I like the abridged series better
I used to watch the show when it was on, but I don't remember any of the "rules" of the game.
it makes fun of the show wonderfully
yeah me and Dark are ripping this movie
TrixieMuffins XD
hah who doesn't
You think someone would break in his house and steal it a few times.
YES, that's why they're keeping it in a MUSEUM WHERE EVERYBODY COULD STEAL IT

infact the end of yugioh is like if you stretched this movie out 20 episodes
08,01why isn't his voice all squeaky then?
yu gi is supposed to be 11
LOOGIE!
at the beginning at lwast he was 11
08,01shut up mokuba.
Can't you explain all that in the car?
Is Mokuba a boy or girl?
It was never clear
DerpyMuffins: yes
DerpyMuffins: boy
08,01Dark92Enigma: yes
08,01whoops
mah boy !
Fart joke? Really? :S
Tristan, FULL OF HAM
08,01*DerpyMuffins
a fart joke...............we just heard a FART JOKE!
cowvarkian: Yes it was, you mom lied to you
This is CLICHE
yugi sounds exactly like dipper pines
THIS IS YOUR ASS
Dark92Enigma: yea...yea we did -_-
noone cares about Mokuba.
AJIsAwesome: yeah a very bad joke xD
TOILET HUMOR FTW
Fl00t4hSh41: well, then everyone that I ever met lied to me too
actually in the first season i honestly cared about Mokuba only becuase she was kidnapped
cowvarkian: Says a lot about your social circle, no?
What is happening right now?
he kept the his most vaulable cards ever on an exposed pouch on his waist? lol seems legit
Fl00t4hSh41: and I purposefully changed my voice so I wouldnt sound like an annoying, squeeky, 13 year old
THAT'S THE MOVIE'S PACING, don't blame me
NO CLUE JUST ROLL WITH RainbowAsh
yes. let's cheat
They sure look alike dont they?
What the hell does YuGiOh mean, anyways?
great Facial expressins
its his name
08,01the lipsyncing in YGOTAS is better than this.
ASoftFluffyThing name of the Character

All that money spent on a fucking DUELING ARENA. Just do it in the street or someone's house and be done with it.
AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHA
It's not that hard.
that make no fuckin sense.
this was horrible movie... you should be ashamed
Dat computer
How do the arena simulate cards that have never been used before?
all the simulations he could have done cant beat bullshit top decking
Well, I wish I could stay, but I'm going to dinner. Bye, everyone!
Fl00t4hSh41: magic
I've been here for all of 20 minutes and I can already tell this makes no sense and watching everything beforehand would not have helped at all. :D
Dark92Enigma, I see.
Fl00t its kind of a holgram
why seal the exits!?
SEAL ALL DA EXTIS
youdontsay.jpeg
08,01CrimsonPhoenix: i guess
Shut up and kill my cards.
cowvarkian: How do the holographic systems know what to show when the cards have never been used before?
also what if the janator was in one of the hallways and got seald in I WOULD SUE KAIBA's ASS
08,01maye the best! pet! win!
why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS? Maybe the narrator from before forgot to mention that Yugi defeated Kaiba became King Of Games, by defeating none other than Pegasus to save his Grandpa! AND WITHOUT THE GODDAMN GOD CARDS! Yeah, forgot to tell us that, you jackass!
Kiba is really obsessed about this card game
Alle Enrances are still open!
Fl00t4hSh41: they make something up?
Fl00t4hSh41: I don't know, magic
I start bacause I said so!
EPIC GUTAR REMIX GO
Fl00t4hSh41: the holograms are what make the things, not the cards
head bang card activate
Combustiblelemons: JUST When i thought the dub was shitty enough
Kaiba beats Yugi OME TIME and Yugi's career is over? ....:D
in the show who makes the cards for duel monsters?
Cypresswolf: sure
it's just hammy all round huh Dark92Enigma
i wonder if we did get someone rich enough if they will make holgrams for pokemon :D
Starlight_Phoenix: pegasus
OP
Cypresswolf: Basically yes
*pegasis
Dat cheating
bah spelling
LYRAMID
he just said Chant
funny how many times yugi has pulled the king/queen/jack knight combo, and people in the series are almost always surprised by it
HE JUST SAID HE WAS CHANTING
Combustiblelemons: yes, but at least they try to SHUT UP
BAD MOVE
slifer no slifing
why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS?
That has to be the silliest name for a dragon I've ever heard
Slifer , the executive producer
20% cooler than any other card
the oods oi summoning that so fast = 1/infinity
indeed... there's like no quiet moments to gather thoughts.
SLIFER.......THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
SLIFER, NO SLIFING
Slifer no slifing
SLIFER THE FOX
Slifer, the exploitable reason he loses his final duel in the series!
SLIFER THE SLUT XD
well, part of it
I think they made up new Cards just for this moviue
Hang on... is that Brock's VA?
wait yu gi loses a duel
And here we come to the final duel that takes up the rest of the movie
GilDash: Yep
WHEN
Lil_B: some cards yes
Lil_B: Yes they were
Lil_B: pretty sure this movie is mostly a marketing move yea
Knew there was something about his voice...
so, what, do the cards now have some sort of magical properties?
yep
J_E_Smith71: THE REST OF THE MOVIE...........it's NOTHING BUT FIGHTING
IT S LIKE POKEMON :D
how does his cape stay up?
CEPT WORSE
winged dragon of ra has 0 atk right now
DU DU DUNNNNNNNNNN
What does that card actually do?
I thought that the grey haired gay guy made them up...
I'm quite knowledgable in YuGiOh as an Anime, watched a lot of it because the Airtime was just riught :/
BULLSHIT
o.0
CHANTING GO
Dark92Enigma: Well there a few interludes where they are trapped in the thing we summons later
Vordox of Course!
But other than that yeah
/me scribbles down his own card and on it says "The player using this card wins."
I WON
Thats pretty awesome though, its not a total loss
love how kabi gives no fucks a lazer is going through his miilion dollar dome
Or the thing he just summoned
Looks like the rules... Just screwed you.
hah, rules
So basically, yugi has to play with the same cards as everyone else for once
card games are srs bsns
what are those
rules
OVERKILL!
cowvarkian: There are several types of cards......Monsters, Trap, Magic, Fusion, and God Cards
love how kabi gives no fucks a lazer is going through his miilion dollar dome
Dark92Enigma: no, I was saying that because they barely even follow the rules in this show
sounds like jabba the hutt
cowvarkian: oh
Quick_Thinker it's only a light Sinmulation, nothing real :P
couldn't someone just make up a card that wins them the game but say "oh no this is legit i found it in an egyptian pyramid!"
ghost time!
OMG ITS SAURON!!!!!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIFES
WELL
SATO IS A MURDERER
GREAT
Lil_B when cards like that are plaed they do have actuall effects
BYE MOVIE
so here's my number!
call Venkman!
so call me maybe
Combustiblelemons: >.>
Quick_Thinker I know, even though it makes no goddamn sense
And then everyone died. The end, movie over.
sorry :P
08,01have we lotteried yet?
LIGHT SHOW GO
nope
AGAIN......why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS? Maybe the narrator from before forgot to mention that Yugi defeated Kaiba became King Of Games, by defeating none other than Pegasus to save his Grandpa! AND WITHOUT THE GODDAMN GOD CARDS! Yeah, forgot to tell us that, you jackass

CHEAT
Hi!
spoiler: heart of the cards and such.

I had that card...
hi
BladedWings: just when i thought :'( i lost them.......ANYWAY, i'll look for more cards
Did you just summon a bunch of monsters in 1 turn ?
Biggysweet: Spoilermuch?
why they have to know attack names i'll never know
aww Valkryia...
why Ionic Spear burst? can't it just be a normal Spear burst?
i jsut say DARK MAGICAIN ATTACK
There's invisible Metroids at work here.
Dark92Enigma: i still play from time to time with some buds lol
WHAT
HOW?!
HOW DID YOU SUMMON WITHOUT ANYTHING?!?!?!
dat dark clown music
Vordox: magic
dis game makes no sense
he can summon him by sacrificing the paladin
sounded like farting
Vordox, practicing his cheating off-screen
i can't comprehend these rules.
How're you doing?
did he just sack his paladin for blue eyes?
Combustiblelemons: hah, rules
BladedWings: i once won a friendly tournament, BY USING THE THREE GOD CARDS
so this move was one of the few legit ones
Vordox because fuck da Police, they are in a goddamn light Pyramid!
This makes me not want to attempt YuGiOhfor a second time.
Vordox: Paladin of White Dragon allows him to exchange the Paladin for a Blue-Eyes
A room of coffins
screw the rules i have money
IT'S A TRAP!
Dark92Enigma: lol
MELONS*
ITS A TARP
BladedWings: yes, i had all three of them
yeah i don't think there are any rules to this game
skyrim in a nutshell
I'm ok, how bout you?
the kings speech? is it a good movie? i don't know it :)
Translation: IT'S A TRAP
<-- probably not real Egyption
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYIN YOU EGYPTIAN FUCK
Dark92Enigma: cool, anyway back to the bad movie :D
Vordox: I know, since I have that card.
I'm good.
Quick_Thinker: gibberish
that run move
XD\
i have all 3 god cards twice oh and a legal dragon of ra
<3
Quick_Thinker: I'd translate it for you, but this chat is SFW
RUN NAO
Talk later, run now
RUN FOR YOUR LIIIIIIIIIVESSSSSSS!
zoinks lol
Quick_Thinker: Probably something like "My eyes my eyes oh god where are my eyes"
that was honestly hte best part of the movie
ZOINKS!????
you wish this was scooby doo...
...
Zoinks?
Seriously?
Vordox: yes
scoobydoo refernce
SEAL ALL EXITS.. DAD AND Tea GET IN SOMEHOW :D
Scobby doo! Where are you?
did triston just say zoinks? how did i not notice the first time i watched this?
Thjat reminds me... I have exactly 1 singe YuGiOh Card... and it allows me to summon Exodia with only one Card -.-
This movie made so many references
Quick_Thinker, the building was damaged
Quick_Thinker: THE translation was: IT'S A TRAP
NO Raggy, it's a RHOOOOOSSSSTTTTTT
legend tells
pony_300: Pot roast?
Quick_Thinker: Gramps got in. Yugi HAS no parents.
AND THEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED
pony_300: a roast?
everything is anubis' fault
of a man whith one kick could move a mountain
Heya everypony :D
oh thanks mokaba for telling them to rewind the movie
get ready to du..due..due...DUEL!!!!
DUELISTS
LEE SIN
Meanwhile: lol Ghost ppl with an R
Quick_Thinker: CONSISTENC------Wait, the building was damaged
everything is Kaiba's fault since he dont listen to anyone lol
Dark92Enigma: Why is the Firenation always invading at these inopportune tumes?
*times
Fl00t4hSh41: that's the joke
Valkyria looks so cool, trade that in over Dark Magician Girl
This game is broken
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE ATTACK TO USE IT
http://imgur.com/pPjVl
IT'S A TRAP
NOOOO DARK CLOWNY!
FUCK DIS CARd
wut
Quick_Thinker: because yelling it makes it stronger
CHEAT!
FUCK TENTACLE SERIOUSLY OP
Quick_Thinker: It's an anime thing. You wouldn't understand
Okay, credit where it's due. This is a good strategy.
wow that is cheap card
Fl00t4hSh41: I'm sure
YAY HE LOIBES!
i like that music for Peten
Quick_Thinker: Trope: Calling Your Attacks.
Damn mimes.
Yugi's advantage has always been that Duel Monsters is a broken mess of a game he could exploit the hell out of.
LIVES!
How many cards does he have, 20-something
screw the rules
the fun has been trippled!
wait... but he can defeat 3
ASoftFluffyThing: 52 EACH one
Please tell me this is all being made up.
man luna is gonna be pissed
40 technically
08,01i'm actually really enjoying this
FUS RO DAH!
'Cause this makes no sense at all.
Why does Seto constantly summon King Ghidora?
This game is rediculous
SCREW THE RULES I HAVE MONEY!!
Dark92Enigma, Ohhh.
but they have something like 100 if you look every episod
SCREW THE RULES, I'M MAKING THEM!
Does he want Godzilla to interfere in the duel or somethiung?
IT'S SAURON MOTHERFUCKER
and they have really often the good one
PYRAMID SEX?
...
They're going to have baby cubes
not ruling it out Dark92Enigma
Yugi cheats because he makes someone else fight his duels
Dark92Enigma, dohoho
They are up against Caramel
In this game, anything goes.
Lord of the Dance ?
cowvarkian: Insert NO clip right here :D
did yugi (not yama) ever fight anyone beside in shadow games or season 1?
Dark92Enigma: I just heard it, I didnt want it
yea, this movie actually isn't too bad compared to the OTHER Yugioh movie, which was cheesy as hell... and included Jaden Yuki. ._.
*GASP* FORESHADOWING
so it can see things in the future unless someone already saw something that was going to happen?
pony_300 that one was pure fanservice
Combustiblelemons: sure
Quick_Thinker: He thought the Pharao in the Final Episodes
my head hurts from this.
*fought
Not sick, which is good. XD
This show made more sense when i was 8
so he fought yama i thought he was a good guy
What exactly is the Pyramid of Light card supposed to do?
Can't he just surender?
Biggysweet: everything did
Yugi could just forfeit the game
me too Biggy me too
can't pharoah just not do anything sao his turn lasts forever?
Is it me or does he sound like Brock from Pokemon?
fave card
Dragon1029, same VA
nope RainbowAsh cant in something called a shadow game you quit your soul is stolen
YAY
Dragon1029: He does!
KAWAI DESU NE
Quick_Thinker: It was the final DUel. The only way the Pharao could pass on was, if Yugi beat him in a duel.
Starting to think he has a fetish for that card.
OBLITERATE!!! wait no
If Yugi forfeits the game, would they both die?
Dragon1029: And for some reason I never noticed that.
WOMEN
WOMEN EVERYWHERE
LOLIS and stuff

Well... Nothiong wrong here... if this is how the game is played than it's totally Legal... and BS
What are you up to Cades?
don't worry GilDash ... i feel ya.
By the way, there’s another common flaw in this movie. I want you guys to point it out:
Deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
aperure science extrusoion funnel?
IT NEVER SHUTS UP! IT NEVER TAKES A BREAK!
Dark92Enigma: thats its horribly written?
Again, if Yugi just forfeits, will both he and Kaiba lose or die?
oh GilDash when i first started being in this chat i had all kinds of meters eventually after my own little story arc they all blew up it was fun
Lol
Cards are dangerous
and bye everyone :/ my internet may say goodbye soon :(
Card games are serious buisness.

How does he know all of this? "He looked it up"? Where?
Dat Exposition :/
Bakura kills Pegasus in the manga
hugs Lil_B back :D
it was on wikipedia. so it must be legit
and somehow slipped a special card into pegasus's deck...HOW? Oh wait Magic of course
Soulero: He didn't create the game, technically.
/me Exposition, exposition RUSH IT OUT A.S.A.P.
CriticKitten: Yea, but for Kaiba to admit that would also be admitting the whole mystical stuff is real.
Hi, Lil_B. :)
Soulero: The show later reveals that he actually basically stole the whole thing from an ancient Egyptian game. :P
stab him in the face
^ now Dark if were are going to crtic it we ccant use the NCs jokes
well i wasnt really watching it cratorkid
EspyLacopa: He does, at the end of the series.
and now your OUT NUMBERED
one thing that seems funny is that this entire ordeal has been going on since Yugi put together that puzzle... yet everything only began afew days ago movie time
nothing

AJIsAwesome hi and goodbye, I'm, just waiting fro my Internet to be cut off at exactly 23:30 :P
I have a stiff.
RainbowAsh: No, in ancient Egypt the monsters were real.
>hundreds of mummies
pwd
>3 people
Dark92Enigma, I withdraw my question.
pwnd
CriticKitten: Yea, because it's whacked him in the head so many times He didn't really have a choice but to believe.
which is in 1 min for me
Lil_B: Ah, I see.
Dat GX reference
ACK!
RainbowAsh: It was actual monsters and actual magic involved.
CriticKitten, why aren't they now then?
enslavve the earth
Cards win against tanks huh?
But aren't the creatures themselves alive?
what is the point of this evil plan
Zuul did a better job at this.
thank god he didn't show 5D
wow, talk about eye candy!
OK, join the Villains-who-go- little-to-no-screen-time Club (Venom, Darth Maul, and Bobba Fett)
wow, talk about eye candy!
also IF THE MILITARY GOT INVOLVED THEY WOULD ahem NUKE DAT SHIT
Huh. Kinda like how pulling the Master Sword unleashes Ganon's powers. At least in Wind Waker.
Nothing really.
<.<
Anubis's plan, free himself and shit gets REAL
And I think in Kaiba's past life as Priest Seto, his hot girlfriend got turned into a duel monster: the Blue Eyes White Dragon
crazy woman
JUMP
RainbowAsh: Two reasons, an IC and an OOC. From the IC perspective, it's because the pharoah sealed the monsters into stone tablets. OOC, because card games sell well
JUMP!
what an idiot!
ppoor wording is poor
Hey

Dat special ink
SOUNDS FAMILIAR HUH?
How are you doing?
So
OK, I know this is Yu-Gi-Oh related, OF COURSE they’re gonna talk about friendship, but…….this is pushing it!
^^
STOP TALKING AND DO SHIT ALREADY
FRIENSHIP
FRIENDSHIP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh so...Friendship is magic?
RainbowAsh: Pegasus just stole it from the Egyptians. What a hack.
obviously an MLP rip off
WORLD IS BEING DESTROYED
HELLO!?
they are missing two elements
MOVE
yugioh had the power of friendship before MLP lol
so when is anubis gonna taste the rainbow?
Meanwhile: totally
Friendship of the cards
HUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH cheese.... clogging intestines....!
The elements of a pen drawn smiley face!
mlp did friendship better
alright, you?
OH YEAH THAT SYMBOLB THAT WAS NEVER SHOWN AGAIN AND WAS IN EPISODE ONE ONLY AND THIS MOVIE I CALLL BS also YU GI WHAT AOBUT THE FUCK IN HEART OF THE CARD i think it is more powerful

MLP did it beeter
TASTE MY RAINBOW TRAP CARD MOTHERBUCKER
incoming bullshit Tea kick

FRIENDSHIP FAILED
Welp.
CriticKitten,Thanks, that helps me to understand a lot. Well, in Pegasus defense, the copyright should have been almost expired after 5000 years
lol
gravity how does it work
where did that come from
wat.
i like how the text go so fast noone can read it!
wat
when did she learn karate
shes their pinky i guess
Johnny Rotten :D
What
Fun fact: Mokuba is voiced by Bulbasaur
lol
We can read it just fine
WEAKEST
RainbowAsh: Should the cardgame be public domain then`?
ENEMIES
every Mummys name is Jonny Rotten
EVER
Nyeh!
Come on guys, lets not lose our heads
fire
KICK THEIR EVERYTHING
mummies are lame
Mummies alive.
bash the head in!
they gave up pretty fast didn't they
BURN THEM!!!
Double tap
Fl00t4hSh41, that Egyptian game should be public domain, so everyone would be free to base commercial products on it.
Quick_Thinker: Heart of the Cards is more powerful, but this is YU GI OH related of course someone will talk about friendship
I'm doing good. Feel kinda silly because I mistook my usual period symptoms for possibly getting sick yesterday because something's been going around. >->
Why isn't there a survival horror game with mummies?
Kaiba you have problems
or maybe Stream as a constant Datastream doesn't turn off the Modem :/ anyway good for me :)
Kiba has some major problems
somethings not right im losing
ah, that happens to me all the time -.-
a gardener you say?
Kaiba just wants to be the best at a childrens card game
Payback = Destroying world
Quick_Thinker: by the way, now you know why i quoted the NC? to correct Combustiblelemons for one second
isdiot
That blue eyes is faaaaabulous.
Biggysweet this game is srs bsns
Kaiba is Brock
whoa did I start a flamewar?
big shield gardner
lol
so shiny
i wanna BE THE VERY BEST DUEL THAT NO ONE EVER WAS to collecct them is my real test to learn tactics IS MY CAUSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe (EVERYONE COME UP WITH MORE LYRICS KEEP IT GOING)
over a card game
nothing except stoping you from having your revenge
Better not to be both sick and on my period though... That would suck.
Watapon!
Pot of Greed. The Bill of Yu-Gi-Oh.
WATA WATA WATA PON!
Only real duelists use Watapon.
Ugh, yeah >_<
Watapon is besyt card
PON PON WATA PON!
oboxious celtic...
He summoned Link!
damn pot of greed is from first season
*obnoxious
rofl such deadpan
Inb4 Heart
celtics are now elves
canon
dat Celtic Guardian is so Obnoxious
He is obnoxious alright
now he's ripping up his cards
Biggysweet the big shile guy too, and actually most of his cards I think
cowvarkian: I always new Irish people where all gay...
1900 attack and higher cant attack him
Kaiba YOU HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES STOP AND LISTEN TO YU GI
wait, there's a card that would force you to rip up your own cards or somethin? Or is Kaiba just being extra dramatic?
DerpyMuffins: Can't DESTROY him.
pony_300: yes
Fl00t4hSh41 hey, I'm Irish and not gay
lol stream froze and lyra looked like she was a card on yugi's duel disk
this inner dialoge had no point...
So pegasus gave Kaiba the shiny dragon, but that doesn't look so great against the god cards, does it?
Pony_300 both
Do you know of any websites I can upload some zip files to download them later?
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
IshBlueEyesWhitePony: Are you an elf?
It would also suck simply to get sick because I needed to do my laundry today.
Lil_B: he's arguing with Anubis, who possesed him
DO IT YOU WHIMP (in form of the 2 best sisters)
GODDAMIT KAIBA YOU IDIOT
Fl00t4hSh41 no
Pride vs Pride much?
Quick_Thinker: DO IT (In form of the Emperor)
more ambitious then ageless god...
seems legit
His ego is so big, a god cant control him
QUick_Thinker: I mean in reality. Can't see the manufacturer making a card that would dictate a person tearing up their own cards
King of games. Nice title
Dark92Enigma I know, but there isn't really a big struggle going on right now
IshBlueEyesWhitePony: Then clearly you are no Obnoxious Celtic Guardian
pony_300: I can
pony_300, MTG did that.
and if Kabi did blow it up he would actuall be able to fofit (without the pryamid its not a shadow card game
pony_300: then they would buy more cards
forget the rules
so no soul steal
Oh god, a naked man!
Don'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotchDon'tlookathiscrotch
a wild Anubis appeared
Fucking hell Kaiba you dumbshit!
SO FINALLY, AT THE 1 hour, 11 minutes mark, (yeah, I timed it) ANUBIS FINALLY APPEARS! And YES……his diet is HAM-based!
Head Crush!
SPLAT
DED
He trid to tell you and YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN
It's...some massive guy with freaky skin issues.
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw
OK, join the Villains-who-go- little-to-no-screen-time Club (Venom, Darth Maul, and Bobba Fett)
ROFL, I'm going to have look that up, that sounds unbelievable for me that any company could be so callous
damn... that was nasty.
and then a viking appeared
isn't Anubis suppossed to have a Jackal for a head?
it's... it's ... Beautiful!
ASoftFluffyThing: DUUUUUUUUUUUH!?
it's thor
CHANTING IS CREEPY CHANTING IS CREEPY
.....that guy aint anubis
If he's an ancient egyptian wizard, why is he blond?
Biggysweet wrong mythology
ASoftFluffyThing: THE ''DUH'' was for Kaiba
anubis is a judge. he aslo has a dog head
The movie's almost over and you just now show up? Who are you, Venom?
Anubis is the Ultimate Warrior?
IshBlueEyesWhitePony: anubis can probably change his form
?
Fl00t4hSh41: Because magic
this bitch aint no anubis
Dark92Enigma, I think I'd let Kaiba die for his stupidity.
He_Man?!?!
evil he-man
Anubis, WHY NO DOG HEAD
ANUBIS WILL CRUSH YOUR PUZZLE AND HAIRCUT, HULK HOGAAAAAANNNNN
IshBlueEyesWhitePony: he's a god, why would he be conformed to a single form, he's not a mortal
Azuredragon: He's Venom AND Darth Maul
Is he Broly?
heart of cards < friendship in the show in the movie heart of cards > friendship
pony_300: you noticed what I said, huh?
If he didn't have all those veins everywhere and wasn't so evil, I'd hit that
ewwww
ASoftFluffyThing: hmm
This guy looks like he needs a Fist of the Northstar death
SMOOZEEEEEEEEEEE
never miss a chance for an Ulitmate Warrior joke.
Nothing can stop the smooze
O_O
ASoftFluffyThing: -_- really?
that guy looks like he needs to wash his hands
pony_300 HULK HOGAN, WE' COMIN' FOR YOU!
WHOA
hot
kinky
i'd hit that
cowvarkian, well I would. Just needs to be not evil and scarry
KILL THEM WITH FIRE!!!!
BladedWings, you would too.

ASoftFluffyThing: I wasn't disagreeing with you
isn't*
Well. That's ugly.
cowvarkian, lol:3
what are they playing uno now REVERSE
Lil_B I don't think he said Anthro
man Anubis is like a walking talking movie trailer quote
thouhgt that too
IN THE SHADOW REALM IT WILL BE TIME TO DUEL HULK HOGAAAAAAAAAAN
ASoftFluffyThing: *blush* n-no i wouldnt
pony_300 TAKE THE CONTROL, HOKE HOGAN, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
BladedWings, you're blushing. Yes you would.
HEART
Poor Watapon.
GO
HEART
HEART OF HEART!
HEART!
IshBlueEyesWhitePony ah.... he said Andro... >.<
If you used that on the elf you'd have won you jackass.
ASoftFluffyThing: *blush harder* s-shut up :$
OP
hey just let him survive...
Why didn't you use it on the elf?
Hey everypony!! :)
that sphinx looks like jeese
BladedWings, nope.avi
Then... Why didn't Andro-Sphinx attack the Celtic?
Lil_B: tricky bitch, aint he?
because he wants to drag it out meanwhile
He would've won.
how are things ponyloverforever
That Androsphinx doesn't look androgynous
HEART
Meanwhile, because they enjoy us suffering
Combustiblelemons: He's an idiot.
Dark_Horst yeah :/
I WILL TAKE YOUR LAST 100 LIFE POINTS AND PRESS SLAM THEM INTO THE ETERNAL ABYSSS, HULK HOGAAAAANNNNNN

/me hugs all the ponies in Chat.

BEHOLD the power of friendship!
Rain: magic

troll yugioh card
dat blue eyes nuke!
ADVERTISEMENT
oh hey just noticed YUGI IS DUELING
DEUX EX MACHINA!
YU GI IS DUELING FOR ONCE
lolwut
He sacrificed himself 3 times now
Shit just got real
funny thing, why the fuck did Anubis make THEIR monsters real too?
Quick_Thinker: STILL DOING IT
where did I lay my Exodia Card too ?
gotta love kamakazi dragon
Hi guys I'm back :)
and then everypona is happy and the credits appears..... the end... right? :)
pony_300: because happy ending?
yugioh needs some SERIOUS rebalancing
Exodia was banned
But the dragon was from the game Pegasus created, so how would it be real now?
alright i have no idea how this happens.
Okay, again.
GO GO GADGET-DEUS-EX-EX MACHINA
Shenanigans
FATALITY
AND NOW THATS THE END RIGHT ... RIGHT?
I'M MELTIIIIIIIING
Is it actually over now? :D
pony_300 he probably just set sv_realmonsters to 1 without thinking
N CLUE
WTF IS HAPPENIIIING
yes finally dead
GilDash: probably not
Quick_Thinker: YES, we're near the end partner
i seriously cant watch this, its hurting my brain
So why did he not just start this whole giant monster thing by just vaporising everyone?
The card game is based on the real thing. Ergo, when the dark magics of a shadow game are invoked, the powers become "real".
YAY
DED
let the bodies hit the floor
what.
Bye Dragon
how did this dragon get real -.-
ASoftFluffyThing: by the WORLD, BY THE WORLD
xD
You are OP
lol programming jokes
Discareded
Also, something that's always bothered me about Yu gi oh cards, whats the deal with the ancient egyptian robots and toons?
Bogy: magic
Meanwhile, like I said before. They want us to suffer.
End?
Also why does Blue Eyes Fabulous Dragon sound like a chicken with throat ache?
oh of course..
OH ANGEL CHOIR your correct to do it cause here they come the CREDITS :D
dat voice
so camp.
lets see he came back like 3 times so maybe tea maybe
FRIENDSHIP
CriticKitten, that would be like saying that if I wrote a story about a nuclear explosion the library would go boom if someone dropped an a-bomb
XD
whoa, kaiba pretty much said bullshit
Meanwhile: Because........this movie is terrible
RainbowAsh: The show does this repeatedly. >_>
bye gays
OH MY GOD KAIBA
he never change
indeed it is.
DON'T BULL FRIENDSHIP! CELESTIA WILL HAVE YOUR ASS!
bye mentallyeffedguy
No letter to the princess from him
Someone PLEASE kick him. Pease
bye mentallyeffedguy
BladedWings dats bullshit
That wasn't Anubis, that was the gaddamn Loch Ness Monsta, tryin' ta get tree fiddy out of me
CriticKitten, I see
What he doesn't have is ancient egyptian magic.
Why do I see NMM when I think of Kaiba?
dat message
dear celestia...
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/3/sKhETFjarUSvC-OsTcPt5g2.png
I'm thinking some of the cards are based off the old game, but Pegasus made more cards and added them to the game
OH, SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!! THIS ISN’T A MOVIE! THIS IS AN EXTENDED EPISODE, AN ABORTED STORY-ARC THAT SOMEHOW GOT A BUDGET!!!!!!!
And the moral of the story is...buy our cards.
nope, everybody knows you buy Friends with Money
RainbowAsh: It's canon that shadow games activate the powers of the original Egyptian game, making the effects of the game real. It's fucking bizarre, yes, but it's canon in this universe so it works.
i like this song
yay its over :)
dat music :D
NO ONONONO NO SHITTY songs
lame song time!
10/10 of 1000/100 IMDB
runs

I have never felt so old. I barely understood any of that.
atleast tey all didnt laugh at the end
Solitaire/10
blue eyes shining dragon/10?
yay! Credits xD
CriticKitten, ok, but why didn't the other cards in their decks didn't help against that last monster?
"dear princess celestia - today I make a monstercard real..."
it snowed here :)
xD
*claps* whelp, i'm off to bed. Night, everypony :D
Vordox: yes, the chat made this more funny lol
*hits mute and plays Jetset Radio music*
ALL THE CHEATING/10
So if the ancient egyptians made the cards and such, where do all the robot cards come from?
Anubis is the stupidest bad guy since the guys from Home Alone/10
Okay, maybe not the best movie, but there's worse. 8/10
gn8 Dragon1029

Dark92Enigma: Someone needs to enter the other yugioh movie into lottery
08,01honestly, i enjoyed it
:O
I... actually can't believe how bad that was. XD
weed/10
This MOVIE is one card short (ZING)
Well, I was only half watching. At least I got to finish my Dinky-Derpy picture while this was on.
oh wow
Same, I liked it, but only cause of this company going apeshit with me :D
i want to thank Dark92Engima for helping me with this and it was fun and anyone else who threw in thier own comments
LOL I DIDNT WATCHED DA BUCKING MOVIE/pingas
Kaiba is still a duch/10

Goddamn Loch Ness Monsta, I ain't givin' you tree fiddy/10
08,01okay, maybe 6/10
7.9/10 I thought it was funny
alright but I get it 7.5/10 it wasn't bad at all
11,01This movie was better the second time around.
^^
yeah, it IS an enjoyable movie, bnut for all the wrong reasons XD
Pegasus was funny, but the rest of annoying
4.9GB patch for pS2
Goddamn Loch Ness Monsta, I ain't givin' you tree fiddy/10
I don't think I want to attempt YuGiOh a second time afte thils/10
i amused myself with the ungodly bad dub^^
RainbowAsh: Because Anubis was effectively godly at that point. So something that can destroy *any* monster was the best choice. Also because the Shining Dragon was a promo card.
08,01i did enjoy the battles
>_>
songs only get 30s then NEXT SONG
nooooo, not a yugioh rap :[
Quick_Thinker: Of course, it's a law
Also, nothing will be better than Cardgames on pointless motorcycles!!! Lolol but srsly 5d's was good damnit. ;_;
CriticKitten, ah, ok.
Quick_Thinker: what is your analysis?
can't say i hated it but can't say I liked it.
So they can jam as many songs onto the soundtrack CD as possible.
That was fun
o great, cRAP

I now know what I want to choose for B movie.....
i had the soundtrack
5d's had remotely likeable characters, and......................................................................................................................................... that's all you need to be better than any other yugiohs.
4/10 for no quiet or slow moments
11,01It's just trying a bit too hard to sell cards.
<... So many Korean names
my final thoughts 2/10 (rushed as can be, no intro for newcomers, ruel breaking up the ass, OP cards, bad script, funny, lines sometimes, and god the raps and puns) over all BAD
I have a DVD with two crappy AMV's on it
hey
my brain can't comprehend a non stop action scene.
._.
fakeass puffy daddy Come with Me song
08,01Nittany_Discord: well, yes
7Evening sirrah.
5d's had Jack and Yusei. And cardgames on motorcycles.
i watched some episodes when this was first aired on tv. quote frankly, they were better in every aspect
I know my B movie choice too
08,01that's kidn of the point
Yu-Gi-Oh revolves around this hammy crap. And in that regard, this movie is par for the course. That said, it's padded heavily and a bit more ridiculous than usual. Still, it's alright for what it was intended to do. It's probably 4 or 5 out of 10.
3 sacrificed shining dragons/10
08,01and it's cute for that
they're apparently made by professionals
ASoftFluffyThing: what?
http://ponybot.net/pix/4921.png
BladedWings, I NO TELL
pony_300 ok, it's a little better than GX, that's for sure
Vordox now that you mention it :/
7Been a while.
08,01it takes itself so seriously
hello people

Azuredragon, OH SNAP
Ratings/Bronystate
08,01which makes it enjoyable, if you suspend your disbelief at the "WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK"
there will always be an unlimited amount of yu-gi-oh card's...........even 1st generation there still making............gotta catch them all, NOT
ASoftFluffyThing: aaawww...you could pm it to me ^_^ i wont tell either ;)
Quick_Thinker: Problem with your assessment: it's EXACTLY like the show it was based on.
yeah, I decided to check in on Thursday
08,01don't think about it too hard
Dark92Enigma: *thumbs up* .......... god I hate GX.
man your fast at framing sonic
So... just for the sake of the argument, is any anime movie ok for B movie or was this one some kind of exception?
nice room azure.
No monsters were harmed during the making of this film...... except for Kuriboh
And what do you know, there were people in here
Ponies! :)
oh yay ponies
08,01Dark_Horst: i've never actually seen the series; i suspect i would also enjoy it

I should give it a go. I use Photoshop mostly, and it's okay at natural media stuff but a bit limited.
Lyra`, nope :<

I half assed all my final exams and actually passed, thank god for multiple choice.
Pfft
LordDerpington: It took me about a week to actually be able to make drawings like these ^^
Six months, I've not worked six months total in 7 years of school
I worked maybe a single month for my AS levels and got all As in them. :P
anyway thank you guys so much! :D I didn't expect this much comments on a practice drawing ^^
it's still a nice effort what you did
I never take school very seriously; I just do nothing and stuff works out
Sounds like a manageable learning curve.
lol
stuff works out
I like how this is a bragging session about being lazy :P
It's time to d-d-d-d-derp! http://fav.me/d55rcqi
7hah that's my plan. just started my AS and got some preliminary test. did fuck all for my english essay and got pretty much the best score in the class.

Heh, I like that she's got a Pokemon card in there.
Im dead serious about 50% of my work being ponies.

mysterious sounds...
CrimsonPhoenix: no explination is needed.
Pfft
Shizuka, hehe, you cruel cruel person XD
7except maybe like the French parts of Canada.
I thought that was me - I get that chime noise whenever kaspersky warns me about a virus or something

Completely ruined.
7yeah that was pretty shit.

Cypresswolf, how often is that?
7there's an angels minecraft mod.
7it's actually pretty fucking terrifying.
not really well known by my second username
Well if it can't that's 5 bucks that could've gone toward icecream.

and takes less time to type
But I can press tab to auto-complete Quick_Thinker :3
so, a guy just asked me if i want to come over tonight
STREAM IS OFFLINE
7they seek out and destroy light sources and everything
POST VIDEOS
very rarely, most often the chime goes of on websites that have a funny pic via google search
i responded: sure what are we going to do
true true
i already have ice cream on my fridge
Lyra`: >.>
but the seller was totally serious
Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V
Lyra` for?
his response was: hint, it involves pillows ;)
then it just blocks access
has stream ended????
You keep icecream in the fridge?
Lyra`: pillow fight?
now im not sure if i've been hearing the stream ping or kaspersky Cypresswolf lol
Heh, mine will probably turn out bad at first
my response was: COOL! WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A FORT?!?!??!!?
Lyra`, XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK2iLnTR9V8 NIGTHMATE FUEL LET IT BEGIN
I can sew but I suck at making patterns
Lyra`: awesome
then he said: ...

:P
:3
I think I've seen that phone convo.
ehh freezer forget those are not the same

Oh yeah guys
Lyra` it was the perfect response
but i am going to go snuggle
Lyra`: not build a pillow fort?
Makes more sense.

I was going to get into drawing, because mlp style seems simple enough for me, but i still havent gotten around to it
7Razz?
wasnt razz a nutcase?
brb, going to go take back a monitor
drphantom: lol
you guys really don't remember all that?
geez
and the chat went quiet...
7No I was suggesting that 'less Razz' was a perfectly acceptable way to put it
7oh god I had forgotten Doppel until just now
Oh haha
Lol
...
Oh I know doppel was a nutcase
7... remember there was that guy, who was like eighteen and collected MLP, but this was before G4 so everyone just trolled the shit out of him?
11,01They all got mental images of you in a dress Bunny_Striker.
7Pretty much everyone that did that is now a brony.
soon my download will finish
Oh yeah, Dragonmissioner
and i will "accidently" ram them with a fighter
0,5I have mental images of me in a dress
Wrek I'm trying to purchase the alpha squad thing but after pressing confirm purchase it does nothing
he came back to SF not too long ago and made a thread about looking for Razz
Nittany_Discord: oh
If you collect before G4 you deserve troll.
everyone has images of bacon in a dress
i mean
what
11,01And I bet it's sexy BaconMane.
0,5THey're very sexy images indeed
and im signed up for the beta
http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4882361_460s_v1.jpg
I refuse to watch.
I now have a mental image of me in a dress with a moustache...
lovely image Bunny_Striker
And a monocle!
i wonder if he can see oour chat's
*our
he can
such memories
lol
11,01I'll put you to work cleaning my grandmother's house in a maid outfit Bunny_Striker.
Everything was so dramatic back then...
My mom went with my little sister into this hippy produce store
and my sister had taken my rainbow dash hat
and this employee there was totally into it.

Yey! Just (FINALLY!) finished Season 1.
my mom thought he was nuts and a pedophile.
I had to lol.
You mean, for the first time?
Nittany_Discord: My brother dared me to wear a maid`s outfit last halloween
this dude look's like if he got efed around....youre gonna die...(agian if you count me)
11,01Did you?
Nittany_Discord: yes
I did the ultimate brony challange
oh hey Wrek has a yoke for flying
drphantom: listen to pinkie for 5 hours?
7haha
Ultimate brony chalenge? (me:Noob)
no watch all of the MLP episodes in one day
I've never met anyone IRL who likes ponies
Nittany_Discord: if you make a vid of cleaning the house while you are in a maid outfit i will pay you moneys
Except Lambduh
7sometimes on the bus back from school, there's this guy who's just decked out in pony gear.
11,01How much?
I like how Wrek's donned his mirror shades for this.
I dont take it that far.
Nittany_Discord: how big is the house?
seeya
7Twilight Sparkle shirt, whichever pony around his neck, usually some kind of apple bloom hat.
11,01Cya Bunny_Striker.
http://cheezburger.com/6175200000
laters bunn--oh
yeah at that point it starts to get creepy
I probably wouldn't go to conventions or anything like that either
see you later
who is streaming??
11,01Medium-sized. Don't know the square footage.
Wreky is
I say probably because I never did think id be into ponies either so....
who is Wrek in skype with?
I can buy a few collectables for fun
Spaghetticons
what country is wreky from?
sweden
Me and some other people want to go to one and throw spaghetti at people. :P
i think i saw that t shirt before...
oh shit what
Hey who is wrek playing with?
I went to this con last year http://daishocon.com/ and tons of people were dressed up like MLP characters
is spaghetti thing a meme or something?
no idea
An aircraft, most likely :P
Isn't Wrek playing with Sumi?
This is the origin
too late, we know
So basically spaghetti is just socially awkward stuff
oh god guys im not feeling so good i think i might get off my head is spining suddenly
bye
Oh no :(
.-. Get better Quick~
is it actual spaghetti he is talking about or is it some innudendo for something else
that i dont get
o.o Dat map
My friend who's a 4channer made some reference to that and expected me to get it
I just looked at him like 'wtf'
I never visit 4chan
um
sometimes people link 4chan pics and thats all I see.
to the ground!!!
If you want a good example
This youtube channel exists
7.... did you people get weirder in the intervening years or have the memories just softened?
This one
The looks in her eyes
Oh my God. XD
brb~ I'm off to make some coffee
you go do that ^_^
you know what this game needs? sprays.
I find it kind of creepy that he has the camera right in her face like that
Pffft.
unlikely
7I got bored of that video a minute in
I know, I'll just jump to my death.
What game is this?
Ok then
Its half life 3
its PlanetSide 2 closed beta
this looks extremely familiar
7This is weird.
Lol chat is ded
R.I.P. Chat
huh, I'm having second thoughts of just purchasing white 2 from amazon when I could just go to a store tomorrow
7I like to pretend that all the creepy bronies don't actually exist
Well, tired of Planetside 2 gameplay ages ago. Ping me if he starts playing Game of Thrones or something.
This is odd
Is wrek streaming?
mmhmm
sorry, but that's like 50% of the fandom
I think I might be on the wrong server?
chat has been resurrected
You guys are on Esimir right?
7yeah.
Hence spaghetticons
White/Black 2 :I i wonder if its any good
That fist logo reminds me ALOT of the Bungie logo
boom
7Despite having been a part of it, in this place, for several years I really find it difficult to stomach some of the more brutal and creepy aspects of the internet.
Wrek press z or r twice!
cEh
Can anyone help?
okay how did that c get in there
anyway
define "help"
Wrek open you map for a second
Theres parts of mlp fandom you don't want to know exist.
wrek hasnt moved in a while.
I may be on the wrong server, but you can still invite friends, squad, and outfit across them
Ill be back later :P
find this distrubing
I've pretty much become desensitized to it...
I keep trying to god damn purchase alpha squad or just station cash it redirects me to my account management page
And it has no signs of confirming anything
lights off > lights on
I'm god damn frustated now
Like seriously, people need to tag their stuff properly because otherwise safesearch doesn't catch everything.
Boink
killerpony7733: im so sorry for making you mad i didnt mean toooOoOOOOoooo ;_;
I almost never get bad stuff in safesearch
Oh, why didn't noone tell me that there is a PS2 session going on
flutterchu What? you didn't do anything
killerpony7733: oh sorry i thought i did
oh hey the recruit is on stream now
I got a nude picture like once or twice
7I used to be desensitised and I think I just limited myself to the slightly safer parts of the internet once this place died and that just got rid of it all.
pawnch pawnch falcon pawnch
I think my problem is I need to stop wasting so much time on reddit
FALCOOOON PAWNCH PAWNCH pawnch

well yeah
05who the fuck is major J
I just can't get into games that don't have an overall goal

We gonna get a P3 show tonight?
because it's fun
i meanr really... that would have been short work
indeed DerpyMuffins, but it'll be short unfortunately
No Gigabit?
If I were an op, I'd be happy to kick you. It's been ages since I kicked someone from an IRC channel for no reason.
DerpyMuffins giga had an emergency meeting for work :(
Gigabit is deeeead
:P
Not again...
Our Giga is deeeeaaaad.
go for it :D
haha
not dead...just sleeping
WAKE HIM UP
but I guess not :(
What does it say when you try it?
I can't...only love's true kiss can do tha
that*
Are we on the podcast now?
Ohai Allegr0
Or something
I just have on little question: How long will this go on?
I dunno
hey AdamTheDuck
Oh myyy :3
Dat wub
I dunno, I turned stream off ages ago.
forever
quite literaly
Allegr0: Therefore he is hybernated right?
Am I the only one that answers the weekly questions?
the battles in planetside 2 are endless
Franek12354 ...sure, we'll go with that :P
More rocket launchers? Great idea~
DerpyMuffins: Not only... :)
Allegr0 Giga doesn't sleep, for he is Gigabot 5000
no DerpyMuffins, you're special but not that special ;)
lol
There are weekly questions?
What was the weekly question again?
^
Hi bronies/ponies! :)
indeed meanwhile :P
OH'
Bronies and ponies?
What is the weekly question?
NVM
Yeah, the weekly questions are a thing.
hi Pikachu :3
Hello Pikachu
There are none here.
DerpyMuffins: This makes sense, at least for Allegr0
I know what you're talking about. :D
Am I the only one that follows the P3 show?
Saxy's supposed to be posting them every week but he's been slacking. Also he isn't here right now because he's moved his energies to school.
Hi, Pikachu. :)
anyone wanting the last question, make sure to check out the last post or two on the front page about the show :P
Reikim, he's volunteered to do it for us, he's not required to, so don't blame him :P
at the dropsuit collector
selector
I wasn't, I was engaging in friendly teasing :P also he's legitimately busy so I hold him no ill will.
Why does this remind me of Bf3? :l
Because reasons.
Hey Allegr0 :3 whassup buddy?
nm MadSurge :P
Pikachu: this looks much more fun than bf3
MadSurge: I think bf3 graphics are 20% cooler
Pikachu, gtfo.
:P
Whats up friends?
I think this is more escalated war rather than a battle
brb
I care little about graphics. If the game is shit then no amount of graphic will save it
Just my opinion
^
Could depend on the server software too.
BF3 was so hyped on killing CoD and its graphics that it ended up becomeing CoD int he ned.
end*
MadSurge: I would say something similar for sound as well
Damn you Close Quarters DLC...
your opinion is very valid my friend
and i second that statement
damn you ea for yr expensive dlc
your*
gameplay>graphics for me, but i disagree with not giving games credit for good graphics, it takes a lot of effort to do that too
So yeah, I just ended up boycotting EA in the end after killing BF...
battlefield?
I basically care about the gameplay. If graphics are good too then even better
yeah but pretty graphics on a shit game is still sperinkles on a turd
It's been ages since I've been on a network I've been an oper on, so I can't say I'm 100% certain.
^
sorry for bad typing im kinda drunk tonight :P
AdamTheDuck: how did they kill that too?
depends, if it can be played for exploration, and its a cheap game, then it can be ok
MadSurge, killed it for me I should say.
Is Wrek trying to shoot a plane with a tank?
well i don't expect anything good from EA theese days
With Premium MadSurge.
finally got the damn server up, yay me
Premium? It sounds shit already -__-
I used to know all this stuff
Im a Premium Noob as well :)
then I disappeared from IRC for a few years
you guys should just change teams
i didnt die
Terribly bored, bright ideas anyone?
CCCP: niiiice
Yeah, that can happen when you haven't worked with something for a few years.
Meanwhile, lick people :3

Joomay no tanks.

/me flumps on the ground and sleeps
I decided to call it a ban since I had an argument with him earlier when he was streaming stuff that WAS morally offensive. And I felt that if I can't speak out against it, then I have no place on Bronystate. So I started throwing around the P ban, and he said he was happy to oblige since I was getting on his nerves.
The problem is you keep standing in front of bullets.
ASoftFluffyThing: Sleep is for the WEAK!
Joomay pls
DashWithRainbows I know the feel. Due to not being used to it and all and living in such a small apartment with 3 family members it zaps my desire to talk on my mic

4chan is amazing, 9gag and 7chan can suck it
Hugs and kisses, baby girl
That part covers.pretty much all of bronystate
7chan is a bunch of people that got too butthurt about people making fun of them on 4chan and left to make their own imageboard. A more recent and anally aggravated example of this is ponychan
So yes

It's one extra fucking syllable, it wouldn't have fucked up the meter that much.

I prefer pie

SeaponiesofLiverpool, bonus point if you can figure out WHY I picked that movie
I might pick a troll choice for mah B movie......
Trolololol
hint I never saw the movie
CrimsonPhoenix: Because you wanted to put everyone to sleep?
I would've loved to have my B pick up there 2
Twilight :3
because ur trottish?
CrimsonPhoenix: Is it because The King's Speech is an excellent film?
I would pick twilight as a B movie
^
That would be a logical explanation.
what scoota said
Then chat explodes
/me knows why CrimsonPhoenix picked that movie, won't bother telling chat
And then lols
it hasn't already been picked b4 hasn't it

This is why we can't have nice things.
SaxyPretender: Yep. Biolizard.
05,15I know I'm not seeing RP in here
lol
Just fish, fluttercry.
It's all fish.
0,14man, I hated that boss
Dash is armed with weapons of mass.....sparkles?
I blame Ninjazz.
T_T
I wasn't even near the spam limit?
SaxyPretender: I LOVED fighting him

wowo fluttercry you went blind then
Sushi? I just had some last night.
I blame Saxy's laundry.
they lowered it
0,14the end bit was annoying-

Man, the Biolizard was an awesome boss.
0,14hey, you leave my laundry out of this
Once you figured him out, anyway.
0,14^
Sabershy: HOW COULD YOU CALL YOURSELF A SHY? :< meat-eater
SaxyPretender: biolizard, imo was the only boss that put up a decent fight in that game
Spelling?
SaxyPretender: We spent almost 24 hours fighting him one time. Turns out all we had to was move towards him. :|
0,14the floaty bit was hell though
No it wasn't.
It was for me.
You just weren't thinking about it right.

0,14I can STILL perfectly remember key things about that
SaxyPretender: anyothers?
Ooh wait nevermind I've got one.
but in all honestly
I've beaten the bastard something like seven times, it's not that hard.

Heavy Rain is STILL the only game I freaked out during playing.
Martin Luther King Jr didnt get famous by sitting on his ass and keeping his mouth shut.
You can't get much lower than that.
Reikim: As kids, we didn't even think of moving towards him. We thought he wouls tire out and then you had to grind on the tube to hit him.
but rosa parks did.
What I hated was the final boss battle where you just flew and hoped you hit the Biolizard's large... warts.
Especailly the doctor bit.
tsk tsk Ninjazz
Fools.
Good to know I was justified in thinking I was smarter than all the other kids :P
0,14Still, I'm close to fighting him again
more pings because of a game
You made that joke already.
Reikim: Your compliment is duly noted. :P
did i?
Mm, in mane.
Sorry, Rain. Didn't see you there. :p

SaxyPretender i see you playing it on my friends list :3
Jmo, y u no love heavy Rayn? ;__;
0,14yep, got through most of the stories in about 5 hours
it made me laugh.
05,15Heavy Rain is the best movie on Playstation 3
never got the chance to play it.
Stupidest boss, though, was Shadow/Sonic in White Forest.
Just homing attack at him repeatedly and win.
It was literally a matter of mashing the A button.
05,15Also JAAAAASON
wow still no stream
SHAAAAAAAAUUUUUN.
Anyway, gtg! Also; Jmo and Ninjazz, settle this over a bottle of Grama apple's moonshine 'cider'
"Hm, I'm the coolest!" Really, Shadow? :S
Please, if you're going to talk about Heavy Rain you need to mention NAHMAN JAYDEN EFF BEE EYE

0,14that's pretty sweet, Derpy_Hooves
Meh. Religion jokes arn't as funny as terrorist jokes.
beats me, i don't know how much 20 pieces of silver is worth
Derpy_Hooves: I know, but you can't change their stats.
And now we're on religion jokes. Let's see how long this will last.
05,15Let's not

or we can :3

SaxyPretender: the downfall is, if you max out a chaos choas stats, it is impossible for them to win a flying race
scientology jokes anypony?
or is that too easy?
0,14ah
Dam it Lyra
Fair enough, let's face it the religious can't take it.
"Scientology"
0,14never really bothered too much with the chao stuff
cause they will LITERALLY fly past the finish line, and not turn around
no, owloysius, it doesnt get a capitalization.
Besides, Religion is the greatest joke ever told~
Takes a REALLY good one to make me laugh.
05,15That's enough
I played the Chao Garden segments more than other parts of the game itself. :$
Lyra`: It's the first word, fraulein.
it shouldve been enough when people were offended by the ilness jokes.

i mean seriously chat, i am dissappoint
I'm really struggling to think of ideas here, I've already been through dead babies, 9/11, columbine, cancer...

Meanwhile: How about something non-macabre?
yes this is definitely something to hit caps over
Meanwhile, computer jokes would be nice >.>
Overdrive is one of my favourite Touhous for a lot of reasons.
Primary among them is my ability to sympathize.
Canterlock is the prefered mode of worthless expression.

Wrek and his chat lag.
Wow. Triple kick
Hot damn.

just saying, if it was a split, there'd be a ton of quits. That seemed more like... internet lag
well
no stream?
Nope. :)
nope
Still trying to figure out if this is my craptactular machine being crap, my crappy internet being crap or just ponychat's fine services being kinda slow.
Well, I'm pretty much tapped for joke material now.
/me slaps Ninjazz around a bit with a large trout
/me looks at time= 3:12 "NOT EARLY ENOUGH!"
Figure it out faster.
Meanwhile, computer jokes. Now. Or Minecraft jokes
Oh no wait.
huzzah
Ninjazz, do a tracert
You broke it jaymoo. :C
Woopwoop
fixitfixitfixit.
Ryunosuke, a what now?
Doctor: "Bad news, you have cancer and alzheimer's." Patient: "Oh well, could be worse. I could have cancer"
a tracert
School tomorow
Meanwhile: Already said that.
Time for google.
So, howsabout some nazi jokes?
Four.
Did I? I forgot~
Still no stream?
AJIsAwesome doesn't get the joke. Hahaha.
basically, what it does, is traces the route, your internet signal takes from your OS to its destination
Ninjazz: I did.
Meanwhile u already said that!!
Ninjazz: http://i.imgur.com/3pcyz.gif
It's within the finer lines.
Doctor: "Bad news, you have aids and alzheimer's." Patient: "Oh well, could be worse. I could have cancer"
Nah sorry Nazi jokes are out of Mein Kampfort zone.
MEANWHILE I JUST TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THAT STOP!
Hidden joke within joke is still wasn't funny.
0,14All right, that's enough of the stupid jokes.

Why'd Hitler kill himself? He saw his gas bill.

not quite
Spectrum_Rush, yes. Exactly like that. Lol.
I can fix it *ten seconds later* computer go boom
2,14 please read the rules, when a mod asks you to stop: stop.

OK MEANWHILE THOSE ARE FUNNY but the others... not cool
Oh please I've got one more and it's a good'un.
Dj_Cyber-4G so hollocaust jokes ok, cancer jokes not?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwZSzlk4JHA
ValtheJean: y no jokes?
a speed test does upload and download speed testes, a tracert just pings EVERY server and hop from its origin to its destination and you can keep track of ping times rather than upload and download speeds
DoctoDoctorWho: Because some people take offense to them? :S
C'mon just one more, it's not that bad. Promise.
no its makeing fun of hitler not the holocaust
2,14 JOKES, are fine. Just keep it sensitive towards chatters
Bloody bandwidth cap
0,14Nope.
2,14 I.E: stop being borderline offensive
LOl
THANK YOU!
AJIsAwesome: Thats only if they allow themselves to get offended
http://i3.ytimg.com/sh/JOOdP2aaviQ/showposter.jpg?v=504a2fe5
Ryunosuke, huh. Alright. I'll run to Google now.
That's a wonky line though. Whether or not you're offended by something is a choice.
I am of the philosophy that everyone needs bacon, more bacon
DoctoDoctorWho: its not always about being offended. sometimes ilness jokes just reminds you of a memory you dont want to think about it
we need more vespene gas
Ninja gaiden act 4 - 2
2,14 you can say that to yourself if it helps you sleep at night. It's not welcome here
/me takes bacon
those who dont eat bacon, are usually the ones that are uptight with the world and everyone else :)
MOAR PYLONS.
i found a cute picture of twilight http://i3.ytimg.com/sh/JOOdP2aaviQ/showposter.jpg?v=504a2fe5
DoctoDoctorWho: i wasnt offended, im not easily offended, but i can understand how people would not like it
How I sleep is irrelevant, it is. You can either choose to see the humour for what it is or you can get your knickers in a twist.
PeachStreak: just so ya know you're breking a rule there
PeachStreak: Those kind of pictures aren't allowed, you know that right?
Yeah I DEFINITELY need a job :3
oh first kick
lol
Bye all my iPhone is going to die
13Meanwhile: This is your final warning. Behave, be respectful, follow our rules, or get out.

Why hasn't there been streamfor awhile?
Meanwhile: or you could grow up finally
Well anyway, Im fine with a good joke, but these nazi refrences just arent Reich...
PeachStreak: i fucking love that, nightmare fuel only feeds me
I saw Frankenweenie today lol
I think you'll find that is how it works in the real world, and that I did stop.
PeachStreak: nice try though
Derpy_Hooves: first time getting kicked Brohoof /)
Jeesus someone's been ahving a bad weekend.
no brohoof
I wish I had dreams
I never dream
Meanwhile: implying you know anything about how the real world works
first time being kicked
You smell Ninjazz.
2,14 Actually, debating with mods is childish. Whether or not you like the rule is irrelevant. If you press it further, I'll be happy to offer you the ban you've been yearning for
Now mine just got relatively worse.
:<
I always have the same nightmare every night
:3
and i remember it
Honestly, playing with you is no fun at all.
Why hasn't there been streamfor awhile?
like it actualy happened
PeachStreak: actually, you may have been kicked, but that just gave you a very bad first impression :P
...Do tell, DJ.
Dj_Cyber-4G: Have you considered getting help?
then why are you here Meanwhile ?
^
^^
^^^
well actually its obvous why
yeah but its been all my life and nothing ever helps
Dj_Cyber-4G: What is this dream about?
he has no life
Derpy_Hooves: i have been here for a while though so.... ya
Well, I'm here for the movies and for amusing shenanigans in chat.
Lul the no life card.
... well its kind of... weird
i dont know if i love halloween.
its legit this time, though
Lyra`: How so?
I liked the part where we got along.
i dont normally say that, but its true.
or just candy and scantily clad women in the cold <3
Joomay It's the best card out there, yo.
ikr
DashWithRainbows: Better than Blue Eyes Shining Dragon?
Dj_Cyber-4G: Ive seen more weird than you could weird out on the weirding weird
what are you lot going as for halloween?
Although it ties with the "Your face" and the "Your mom" cards.
God damn it AJ, you couldn't resist could you.
Meanwhile: *sigh*
AJIsAwesome Yep.
Jmo: Nope. :P
DashWithRainbows: lies, nothing is as good as the blue eyes white dragon foil!
flutterchu You do realize you can set it so you ignore him, right?
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvz3b3C3M1r3k1m8o1_500.png
And as it stands Val I've not been yearning for anything, I just have a habit of speaking my mind.
DashWithRainbows: no i dont know how to do that
2,14 your actions lead towards the contrary
flutterchu: /ignore insert name here
right click his name
2,14 considering we've been more than leniant with you breaking rules
Hence the "Speaking my mind" part.
That YuGiOh movie ruined any chances of me attempting to learn the game a second time
Is there any stream?
and choose ignore.
cachi01|phone: Nope.

Ouch.
SO optimistic.
2,14 twilight_sprinkle that's enough

2,14 you are to respect all other users *at*all*times*
:V
ValtheJean: im honestly trying to stimulate him
0,14Let's not exacerbate shit, shall we?
^
AJIsAwesome: all this hate sucks, Its taking me way out of Mein Kampfort zone.
twilight_sprinkle, he said stop.
2,14 twilight_sprinkle: then that counts as trolling, I'd advise against that
i know, im not arguing, just explaining
No by all means, carry on. Have a go, I can take it.
LOl wow DoctoDoctorWho
people sometimes not speaking is better than speaking
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNI2EznJEMI
also thank you for the sarcasm earlier, Meanwhile. it made me smile
You're welcome/.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTk-kGykJYg&feature=youtube_gdata_player this one should work
ValtheJean: trolling Oo im serious though. im just saying that he should geta hobby, i dont say it for the sake of offending
Meanwhile, hey, man. Are you okay?
DoctoDoctorWho: http://derpy.me/QMB9d here ya go
Ninjazz: Bustah wolf?
Meanwhile reminds me of this phase my brother went through
2,14 then it's disrespectful. Either way, it's against the rules
ScootaChicken: so the shit hit the fan? XD
Meanwhile, I wish. But srsly, you've been getting a bit more how you say... caustic lately.
But no frankly I'm not. The bottom line is if I think you're a twat I will tell you so, and I don't care what colour you speak in.
Inb4 banned...
Derpy_Hooves: thats amasing:D
dude, everyone is here. Shit. hit. the fan.
2,14 people only get banned for breaking rules
ValtheJean: i didnt mean it to be disrespectful though, im not interested in pointless insults. im not arguing or anything, just explaining
2,14 making an idiot of yourself, sadly, is not against them
Oooooh
Probably. But I'd rather be banned speaking my mind than hang around as someone scared into line.
Lyra`, who's rosa parks?
DoctoDoctorWho: back in your kampfy zone? :3
"[00:21:56] <twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: thats one empty mind you got there"
Seriously people, If you have something to say then just come Auschwitz it!
Not interested in pointless insults.
Sure.
ValtheJean: no, but pointlessly arguing with mods, being an asshole, and trolling are... -_-
so guys...how about them ponies amiright?!
Reikim starting with twilight_sprinkle again ?
Nope.
Butt. Hurt.
Just pointing out things. You know. Explaining.
Reikim: i meant that the whole "im speaking my mind" thing is an excuse. if insulting really is all thats on bis mind, then its empty
Clearly.
i'm on the new seapony diet. I see ponies, i eat them.
your back?
SO, WHAT'S THIS MINECRAFT MOD ABOUTT?
Yo guys, errone just chill ouuuuut.
Come on Dovah man, you know better :P
Ninjazz: yes >_>
Ninjazz: apperently
You know, the one that you can build nuclear stuff with.
I was thinking you were going to bed
Ninjazz: this is #bronystate... Welcome xD
Ok really, they are just jokes ment to make something bad seem funny and not so bad...
And solar panels
so much that rdash is actually on bronystate
ScootaChicken Honestly, just stay outta this one.
kickcount: PeachStreak
I mean, hot damn
Meanwhile, faith in a higher power isn't gambling
Are you around Adjeca
You're a bit late on that one Kandarihu.
Ikr.
strong independent woman who dont need no man ?
Meanwhile: Better late than never.
If you don't like it, there is an ignore function.
Meanwhile, I know now. I was scrolled up when I saw it
Reikim: because hes nt expressing any opinions, hes not having discussions, hes just making jokes that are offensive to others, and hes ignoring their feelings. thats what i meant
AJIsAwesome: Unless you're an electric chair repairman.
is... is it lika a ful moon or something, everyones all antsy tonight
2,14 kandarihu: just don't start with this
rdash: duuuude, you should hang out here more. its not always like this
^
no haha I'm not
Spectrum_Rush: I'm not antsy :3
^^
But, anyways, Meanwhile, whatever's been pressing on your hostile button, I hope it jumps off soon. i really mean that. In the most polite and friendly way possible.
dont prevoke the prevokable
0,14Rosa Parks was an important figure in the Civil RIghts movement
someones anus might get anihilated
*provoke
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks
point proven
Val: So, you've been lenient with me breaking rules. How so, that I might better avoid doing so in the future.
Oh HER
The one who refused to move.
0,14yep
Badass lady. All of my respect.
that seems to be all she did
rdash, it's fun here. Really is. Just it's hit a bad snag atm.
2,14 For one: when a mod warns you for something, or you are kicked for behavior: suck it up rather than bitch about it
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/363/539/340.png I find that word hilarious..
rdash: you hardly ever talk
I saw no racist jokes...
twilight_sprinkle: never said you were...
i remember when it was friendly in here....
Even if said mod is a crybaby?
Derpy_Hooves: not in here, but in my 49 other channels, I do lol
This place is a place of madness. :>
I think a +m is in order
PREACH THE GOOD WORD VAL
actually nvm, i don't want you to talk
Sigh.
learn something new every day
Dafuq
ValtheJean: DoctoDoctorWho, would like me to tell you thats what he thinks of the jokes
funny
Fine I'll work on it but give me some time.
2,14 if you have an issue for how mods behave, you can email bronystate@gmail.com. Otherwise, shut the fuck up because the only crybaby is the person bitching about being kicked
who wouldve thought that lack of stream would cause such madness
The hell did I do now Derpy_Hooves...?
That's always otakon.
rdash: i don't want to talk either :V
Oh lel.
twilight_sprinkle Actually, this was bound to happen sooner or later.
:kickcount otakon
DashWithRainbows: true, very true
huh
They turned off the commands I think.
Derpy_Hooves: oh, you made it sound as if I did something wrong :S
http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw4719--_butthurt.jpg
To be fair though otakon does trip off the kickbot at least twice a day.
Ninjazz: awww
http://mlkshk.com/r/2HUV
Dovah: noice xD
2,14 believe me, we have a special book for Otakon :P
He loves the enter button.
I do believe you.
otakon holds a special place for all of our hearts.
more like he rapes the enter button >.>
Ninjazz, so true
A nice, fat volume in the kicklogs, roughly equal to 1% of the total library.
/me senses extreme butthurt
he is the most shipable
I kinda feel sorry for otakon, he gets kicked all the time
hey Meanwhile
ok I deserved that
Meanwhile:
He's used to it.
x kick
is it because he types fast or laggy internet?
Oh come on.
Meanwhile:
DO WE HAVE TO RESTART DRAMA.
Though when he got kicked like every 2 minutes on his birthday
STOP IT.
the ignore button i FUN
flutterchu: knock it off
*is
That was fun.
flutterchu what do you expect to happen by repeating Meanwhile ?
Really though, I could email the site and say I think some of the mod team are pretentious, jump-the-gun, thin skinned, overly serious twonks but I doubt it'd accomplish any more or less than just saying it.
2,14 flutterchu: stop spamming meanwhile's name
And thus, the cycle of butthurt is renewed.
i only did it like 3 times and he's been quiet latly
Here we go again
2,14 Meanwhile: we take all criticism well, so long as it's actual constructive criticism and not butthurt McGee
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MINECRAFT!
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/318/507/080.jpg
i dont even... wha... i...
Val: Fair enough, why's rape a banned word?
Meanwhile, as a mod for another channel, criticism is one thing that comes far too less than we'd appreciate.
2,14 it's not...?
it is though
Meanwhile: are you nice now ouo
Shizuka kicks for rape jokes. Thats reasonable ish though
^
the word shouldnt be used in vain :p
Seems like individual mod's discretion.
why does that word even need to be used in here?
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/316/781/33e.jpg
The worst those jokes ever come to is a particular scene in a stream
flutterchu don't you have better things to do than seeing if Meanwhile responds to you ?
And someone says "Rape"
That's it.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: okay ;_;
Dovah: dont you have something better to do than just post iamges?
reasonable-ish enough? rape jokes are /never/ appropriot
they arent. however
Red_M: No, so shove off.
13Rape jokes are not funny. Ever.
^
there are many other jokes that arent appropriate, but they are allowed
is this rediculousness still gOing on?!
Now I don't know if she gets night terrors about big sweaty hands and alchohol breath, but it just seems a little too high strung.
wow
...
Rex_Mundi: imo we should get this out of the way once and for all
Meanwhile.
Rape jokes aren't just in bad taste, they also demonstrate crude thinking. It wouldn't really hurt to think up something more intelligent to say than yelling "RAPE" every time something even vaguely sexual pops up on stream.
God...damn...
dat ban....
seriously? are we still on the issue with the rape jokes? geez people
Never thought I'd see the day.
Meanwhile banned?
Meanwhile, at the legion of doom headquarters
well this chat will be evn more ded now
Oh lawdy
Well i didnt see that comming :I
It finaly happened...
...Wekk.
*Well
And I've been here since last November
well whaddya know, +b meanwhile actually is a legit command
Jesusfuckingdrama.
2,14 and not a single fuck was given that day
I had it up to HERE with freakin' drama.
Lol
well, shizuka, banned his vhost, i don't think it covers his actual ip.
ValtheJean: Not. A single. FUCK.
I bet tomorrow Hipster_Brony will come back and ban Dermathil.
ValtheJean: to be fair, if a fuck was not given, you wouldnt respond to him as much as just kick/ban him
I think he konws better.
can you get back from a ban, or is this a perm-ban site?
You know... it's going to get alot lesser Grammer Nazy in here.
ScootaChicken: Hot damn pass me the popcorn
Ninjazz, nazi**
Derpy_Hooves i don't think it does still he has to deactivate the vhost first also i don't think he is foolish enoug to get permabanned
Rex_Mundi: You can appeal to not stay permabanned.
FYI: people, DoctoDoctorWho is 1ft away so, sometimes its him and othertimes it be me.
Rex_Mundi: they can be times or not. you can also get back by changing ip, but thats ban avoiding which is punishable by permaban
Ninjazz: *a lot, *Grammar, *Nazi
2,14 meh, believe it or not, we aren't monsters. We don't actually LIKE having to ban people
O u guiz. <3
Ninjazz: *nazi, sorry.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: the vhost only shows up when you identify yourself
We noticed. You barely ever do.
uhmm True
still though. i want to say that there are other jokes that should be monitored as strictly as rape jokes
uhm...whereed meanwhile go?
Things will simmer down now.
He got banned.
ValtheJean: especially people youve known for a while
ah..
thats for sure
Shitstorm finally arrived.
...there goes that
ValtheJean: Fight. Club.
been here since may
never been banned thing
I can count on one hand the number of times I've seen the banhammer dropped.
Imo, Val, you guys are very linient, sometimes to the point of being TOO linient. I appreciate it really.
Lol.
lolz
this is why i make nice with mods
Osnap
"Oh! its you... how have you been? Ive been fine.... AFTER YOU MURDERED ME! you monster...."
so they DONT murder me while i sleep
Ninjazz: *lenient
Wanna do that again Dovah?
i though Sumicas bot would be on that
ValtheJean, aww we still can't say Quarrel Establishment?
while he doesnt like banning
2,14 nah, the bot got removed after the movie night was over
ValtheJean: You dont like banning but you do oh so very much enjoy kicking for no reason.
he loves joke kicks
ScootaChicken, you're even more nazie than meenwhile.
Flight Cub
Ninjazz: I can't even
help[
2,14 well what kind of fun would there be without joke kicks? :P
fajl;
First rule of the bean club. You dont talk about the bean club
Shizu, really, you should get into the habit of dropping your mod powers more often.
joke kicks are the best kicks
Rain: oh heaven forbid >:3
Fisticuffs meeting
ValtheJean: They offend me.
2,14 honestly shizu: almost EVERY mod has considered it
Shizuka, believe me, I respect how much you've been restraining yourself on that.
I get joke kicked more or less the moment I enter chat every day.
13Reikim: from experience at goon haven, if you aren't being called a nazi, you aren't doing your job right
ValtheJean: i miss the days of mods wars tbh, when users were less troublesome than mods by far XD
Usually by Scoot-Scootaloo, Dari or RinBarDosh.
ValtheJean, but you just kicked Ninjazz for saying F**** C*** lolol. Props though :)
Both understandable and respectable.
*hugs Shizuka*
2,14 fine then Dovah, I'll only kick you when you deserve it
If you're being called a nazi, you're not doing it right either.
Rain ValtheJean can't take a joke on caramel without kicking/warning
Especially since you're been the target of some very caustic comments.
0,5nuthin to do here
indeed so
not a suckup
just a wuss
ASoftFluffyThing, I wasn't kicked by Val.
People these days
1. -- nice starting ip you have there
I like BaconMane.
Well y'know, some things in life are bad.
I'm not espousing an authoritarian, semi-dictator approach to modding. I'm saying that a good balance must be found.
ValtheJean: My point is, it's a joke they shouldnt offend people, if it does they can just ignore it.
a horrible wuss whos afraid of people and hides behind mods like a coward
They can really make you mad.
you havent lived if you havent been kicked/banned
Dat,kik
VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL.
Other things just make you swear or curse.
0,5I disagree, Val
But when you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble, give a whistle!
0,5I have not.
When chewing on lifes grissle, dont rumble, give a whistle
2,14 the difference, Dovah, is when actions are done with the intent of harassing and/or annoying
you havent been on IRC for long without being at aleast kicked or banned once
i remember when i think it was sumica tried to kick himself...it worked
Currently, the scale is leaning too far towards leniency. It wouldn't be a good idea to go all the way to nazi-hood, but it would be nice to see that scale sliding a bit back the other way.
2,14 hence why I said *ALMOST*, LC
3 months. en ming?
2,14 Sabershy: give me a moment >: D
what was my last ban for...
been on ponychat for less than a day... been on IRC for 4+ years
/me is planing on a girls night out.
I love you too, ValtheJean. :)
Sabershy: ive been here for over a year. I have been kicked up around 40-50 times and banned once
/me thinks she might invite Caramel along
but he's a boy
ValtheJean: Then me and DoctoDoctorWho at the very least should be fine, we mean nothing but a good laugh.
i can be a Nazi mod if you want, i'll drop the hammer on everyone atleast once a week
Dken2021 or is he?
I remember the first time I got kicked but I deserved it so it was my fault
6 months. Haven't been banend once. Kicked alot.
I've been kicked sooooo often. Mostly by SaxyPretender. He tends to get kind of antsy whenever I mention the fact that fighting games are CLEARLY an inferior genre of video game.
Rain can i go ?
Mostly by either LC, Dari or RinBarDosh.
13now that that's all over with, if i could direct everypony's attention to the refresh button under the stream
because hes so NAUGHTY
ive never been kicked on ponychat... but have been on other IRC nets
13hopefully mips is working now
TEEHEE
RinBarDosh is best pony.
...
Awwwww
i just missed Meanwhile getting banned!?
:O
No reaction.
2,14 Rain: should I be afraid to ask to what?
Aight. Time to cool off.
NocturnalBlade|Skype, yes you did.
NocturnalBlade|Skype: si
DoshwithRambo pls
NocturnalBlade|Skype, yes. Moving along.

Hiya all what I miss?
Yahwhoz pls
2,14 meh, seen it
Rain le gasp!
otakon17: Ohohoho.
Nazi mods are bad mods.
2,14 technically the one on the right isn't Caramel, that's Toffee
Ah otakon17.
Pushover mods are bad mods.
First time I got banned was for 24 hours. Worst 24 hours ever. But enough about that
Hi, otakon17. :)
Absent mods are bad mods.
hi otakon17
oh that reminds me ValtheJean , i had a few suggestions for your trivia thing. should i tell you now or another time?
Selectively-blind mods are bad mods.
The one on the right is not the Caramel that Val loves...
otakon17 I don't even want to bring it back up.
ScootaChicken: Yh I know about yonder prick ban
...good mods are bad mods
Maybe Caramel changed her name to Toffee, Val.
I was kicked by Scoot-Scootaloo the other day. Needless to say, it got worse from there.
2,14 tell you what, catch me when my head's better tomorow
13ponies seeing it?
What are you talking about?
okie ValtheJean
I wonder if i ever got close to getting kicked...
Shizuka, I see it
Yep. :)
ValtheJean: Not feeling well man?
bad mods being good mods
That's a logical paradox, and therefore invalid.
We're seeing it, and hearing it.
maybe some nice 3.6 will help clear your head Val
i see it Shizuka
2,14 I see you trying Rain, but you haven't said anything Dari hasn't already
13metallica and symphony
Shizuka: I see and hear it loud and clear
certainly hearing it
love you guys!!!
Dari has done it all
yay symphony
Caramel X BigMac OTP
psh
screw paradox's
2,14 g3.6 is only fun to tease the chat with
ive been waitign for a symphone stream
all good mods are bad mods but not all bad mods are good mods?
2,14 G3.5 on the other hand is adorable
S&M is best live metal album
I know, Val. Im not trying. Just happy to have a head canon trans pony to look up to ^_^
I still can't believe you ACTUALLY like it.
Whats your stance on G2?
ScootaChicken: so i hear u leik cheetos...
I wouldn't. You might get caught in an infinite loop. No wait, that might be a good thing.
meh?
ValtheJean: Those... Things adorable?
I offered ValtheJean a download link for the G2 game, but he didn't want to get it like that.
This song reminds me of western showdowns and cowboys and stuff
0,14OH FUCKING HELL, I MISSED THE ESCTASY OF GOLD
Anyway
13derp still had crossfade up
0,14that's because it is, Rex_Mundi
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
ERMAGERD! METALLICA!!! Hi everypony...
ValtheJean: They're deformed! Their tiny bodies couldn't move those massive legs or support that colossal head
Oi
13and yeah that was from good bad and the ugly
ValtheJean i admit my defeat, you can control yourself about Caramel stuff
okay i did all the better things to do
DWR STAHP.
;_;
0,14Metallica opens every show with The Ecstasy-
butthead. Stawp dat
hi Kawaii_icybeauti
All I'm saying is that mods face the danger of leaning too far in many different directions.
0,14....
Shizuka: Good OST
ScootaChicken: ment to be me, not dovah there.
otakon17: One man's adorable is another man's horror, like how you seem to find girls with bodies like men attractive whilst I find them rather intimidating.
<3
hey thelonepony
So are MLP episodes ever actually played here? Lol
Any mod who becomes "defined" by one of the above is not doing his/her job.

Malmortius: Yes.

Lyra`: I did?
AJIsAwesome: you missed with your arrow
You have.
SaxyPretender: I kind of figured now
Mah favourite pony is Rarity

twilight_sprinkle: Oh. :D
And, hopefully, one or two mods are watching and will pick up.

AJIsAwesome: you have to kiss a frog now
oh dear...

Hey Shizuka, have you ever heard the music of this group called Galneryus?
AJIsAwesome: dont worry, it becomes a cow
What If i want a marathon of newborn cuties?
13nope
twilight_sprinkle: It becomes NewSuperBronyU? :O
2,14 Rex_Mundi: then I shall grant your wish my next stream
Probably, yes, but it's now there in neat white text for all to see.
AJIsAwesome: sure lets go with that :D

13channel logs are kept permanently here
DoctoDoctorWho, what army do you roll?
0,14RIP Michael Kamen ;____;
Hiya Lyra` you missed meanwhile getting banned for who knows how long.

I'm getting white 2 later todat.

otakon17: Let's not bring that up.......
today*
Lovely to know every stupid thing I've ever said is still sitting around somewhere.
:O
otakon17: what did he get banned for?
A question for the mods: do you guys really put on Newborn cuties when pee ask for ponies too much?
superretroworld: No idea
flutterchu: yea, shizu stream
It was a permaban. He's gonna have to appeal it by e-mail.
Reikim welcome to the internet where nothing truly get erased
MOVING ALONG...........
Damn
On the other hand, some of my more intelligent ramblings remain in existence as well.
Pee? I meant people.
let's drop the topic.
Sabershy: Eyup....They always do.
Srsly.
2,14 Sabershy: it depends on the streamer
So, how about that airline food? RIGHT GUYS?
2,14 I just think it's funny as hell
Val does.
Okay WHY is it such a sore topic?
2,14 not sure about the others
Sabershy, I don't think all the mods have Newborn Cuties on hand.
( ; ) what is that key called
Because he's a psychotic troll. And we love him for it.
13i still have logs from three IRC networks ago so >>
I know Vivi has at least once
Seriously we've had perma-bans before
otakon17: It got a little out of hand.
What are we even talking bout?
flutterchu: semicolon

Jmo: I sadly do not play the game due to lack of money(but believe me, I would and will asap) but according 2 dovah I know EVERYTHING about the 'verse.

Same here DoctoDoctorWho :P
Sumica used sea ponies for a while but now he signs off with it

hello DaringDerpy!
Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
Inane?
40k 4 lyf <3
do people who appeal permabans tend tO come back?
13i think within two months of bronystate i'd doubled the previous three years combined though
They were anything but inane.
Ninjazz: No I wasn't
Sea ponies kick ass. How are they tourtue?
Jmo: FAV FACTION?
2,14 Ninjazz: it's better to just drop it and enjoy. OH LOOK A STREAM!

Grey Knights.
But seriously, I've made my point. I could make many others, but that's the main one I want to make right now.
G1 getting streamed, a marathon of 80s, is something i wouldnt mind.
Mane's too full of stupidity most times.
Jmo: :O ME TOO!
Shizu, quit turning a blind eye and get a feel for the hammer.

It was given to you for a reason.

I would suggest Eddie Trunk's station, but I don't know anyone with sattilite.
0,14just wait, we're not even at my favorite song from this album
you could just use different colours...
probably not then. that sounds like NewstalkZB
0,14but that doesn't convey VOLUME
pfft... megadeth ftw... but not as mUch as blind guardian
13i remember when megadeth was a thing
woot blind gaurdian
0,14or as my friends refer to it, "MegaDave"
Why does metal sound so amazing with a brass and string section?
disturbed is epic

I feel alone in the light of the sun.
i cant decide between this and ASOT...

DoctoDoctorWho: And with your lack of feels, you seem emotionally dead right?
Shizuka: ikr

DoctoDoctorWho: I understand.

I don't want you to live that way if you don't want to. I'm sorry if I can't help you in person. I would do everything I could to help you, but I can't. I'm sorry.
