Am I imagining things or does the narrative repeat itself.
this movice was neveer to happen and 3 years it did
a kid with a suspiciously masculine voice
/me in Egypt...
thanks to 4kids
http://derpy.me/DZPMh
dat hair
worst part about the anime is how there's little of Yugi mindcrushing people
bondage?
it glowed
dont ask lemosn
Why is a kid even allowed to touch thousands years old egyptian artefacts with his bare hands?
honestly that puzzle never looked too complicated
Theres like 20 pieces
How did he come into possession of this ancient puzzle?
I know right? I could do a puzzle like that in my sleep!
the last piecce in the anime was thrown into a river
ded
yep, nothing weird here
nice going dude, you killed em'
Why not distribute the puzzle pieces across the sea?
Ded
Why not sink them to the bottom of the sea?
UUUUUULTRA ded
You'd think the archeologists would know egyptian.
Ded you know for kids
wait....was it sub yesterday?
I heard "ankh"
for 5000 years it was locked away until some kid with too much hairgel put the puzzle together the exacct ame time as these smucks discover a cave COINCIDENCE
well done kid.
satanic tongues, you know, for kids
great
It's going to turn him into a supersayan.

11,01Because that was a movie about a puzzle unleashing evil.
Why exactly is that?
Way to doom the world, Yugi!
ohh speaking of which, there must be an abirdged movie of this
still a thing for ridiculously large jewelry
apparently demonic possession dramatically speeds up puberty
OOoooooo
man i wish i could talk over this moviee and be heard instead of typing this shit out
THIS IS OUR MOVIE

Oh.
in the 3 years since this show
a movie was made
He cheats
Poor pyramids. They sure get abused by everything sci-fi or fantasy.
Why does everyone dress in such silly outfits?
HI
I think Japan's anime is bleeding over into reality with their ridic hairdos
And whats with those haircuts?
Is the reason that he is good, or does he win because his deck is overpowered? Oh, I don't know...

-----This was a simulation the whole time? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
Unbalanced much?
how is a system overloading from that
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAX
cya
Uuuu.
Not even scientists can figure out a cardgame.
Calculations? "1+1+1=1, now we'll win for sure!"
uahhhhuuhauhauhh
me I’m gonna call the FBI, the FCC, the CIA, but first and foremost, you are FIRED!!!
Whaddya mean "as usual"? you always lose.
I prefer littlekuribohs version.
I don't understand how anyone would think that could beat a setup with an monster that can get infinite strength. Though, it feels like this is a rather dumbed down strategy
Start looking in Egypt?
There is, Seto. Just beat him up and steal the cards.
Wavy cloak in a closed building...Anime.
Moron.
Why would you do that lol
fissure
done
"Srew rules, I got money"-Seto Kiba
SPAH AROUND HERE
But Kaiba's company basically makes all the cards right?
because it wasn't working.
why not use exodia , it was good enough in season 1
and cleaned it out a bit.
oh ok
FABULOUS!
But its basically an ipod now without wifi.

Especially card games that you take way too seriously anyway.
That dialogue...

Saturn, he pets it in his dreams. ;)

Fuck it, i'm gonna play a more decent song: I WENT THROUGH THE DAAAANGER ZONE

08,01and man, littlekurriboh has some of these voices down really fucking well
00,10how odd.
Saturn! you has clothes!!!
my thoughts exactly
Saturn: This is a TERRIBLE example of the real YuGiOh.
in our world these cards are worth about .25 cents
There weren't.
Saturn: blue eyes are rare because only 3 exist in all of existance in the series
By the way, there’s another common flaw in this movie. I want you guys to point it out:
JOEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Which Yu-Gi-Oh movie is this?
this brooklyn accent makes it hard to concentrate
the first one
and not a single girl on that crowd
inb4 someone shoots Yugi and wins the world
inb4 pointless 3 minutes of movie
Still no luck, keep trying!
nice job just shouting that
nobodies
Nobody^4
is that a mexican wrestler in the crowd ?
brooklyn rage~
wat?
i don't get it
Best. Dialogue. Ever.
BROOKLYN RAGE.
XD
:D
The dialogue
THAT WAS TERRILE
....
:D
whywhywhywhy
Oh dear.
XD
after this series however, wh ynobody ever beats the shit out of the main character and steal their cards I dunno. Here, the pharoah might mindcrush you. In the other series... dunno.
....
See not a single girl
HELLO NUR OWWW
Welp.

There's no ponies.
I guess the one advantage of GX over this is that Yuma is more proactive. That's about the only point I'll give to that otherwise horrid series.
Not a legit card.
*yawn*
Those 'shadow monsters' don't really look too threatening.
they need to make more toon cards
TIME TO DO A BS STRATUGY
That's because it doesn't have enough Exodia. Or Motorcycles.
Oh wait a minute I know...before I've even drawn the card...
Exodia on motorcycles?
why show the cards its more fun to be surprised

08,01actually, MTG isn't all that confusing

This... is confusing.
This is a stupidly convolted strategy, Kaiba.

wouldnt it be easier to just walk across the room and punch him in the face?
therte can be only one Kaiba!

and then XYZ-Dragon Cannon
Saturn: this is a TERRIBLE example of the Yu-gi-oh universe
I'd say any example is a bad one as far as YuGiOh is concerned.
08,01Dark92Enigma: stop defending YuGiOh
08,01:P
I know in the manga, Yami/Pharoah/whatever is downright evil at first.
okay does anyone rember if the rest of the cast (joey triston and tea) know of yugi's alter ego?
the Mummy is the Villian!
Saturn: i never said i was defending THIS FUCKER OF A MOVIE <---------
has he touched a fireflower ?
EEEEEEEEEYUP
Why does he carry that heavy-ass thing around his neck all the time?
MTG used to have something similiar in early editions, but no one ever wanted to play that way.
it makes fun of the show wonderfully
You think someone would break in his house and steal it a few times.
YES, that's why they're keeping it in a MUSEUM WHERE EVERYBODY COULD STEAL IT
That's a really bad riddle.

The dialogue..............OMG the dialogue is killing me
08,01how old is Yugi meant to be?
TOLD YOU THEY'LL STEAL IT...........DUMBASS
Saturn: Early teens?
WORST...POLICE ...EVER
Saturn, he looks 13-ish
Saturn: college old :D
14?
i'd guess 14
infact the end of yugioh is like if you stretched this movie out 20 episodes
Saturn: 15
yu gi is supposed to be 11
Saturn the boy about a naormal teen, his other from... 3000 old Pharao
LOOGIE!
Saturn: because then we would hate him
Saturn: I would say between 15 and 18
at the beginning at lwast he was 11
08,01shut up mokuba.
Saturn, that pyramid does something to his voice when he goes into dueling moe.
Is Mokuba a boy or girl?

Saturn: No problem
he kept the his most vaulable cards ever on an exposed pouch on his waist? lol seems legit

How do the arena simulate cards that have never been used before?
all the simulations he could have done cant beat bullshit top decking

WAKE HIM UP
for some reason I thought that being an oper I'd be able to make ChanServ do my bidding
but I guess not :(
that*
Are we on the podcast now?
Or something
I dunno
Oh myyy :3
I dunno, I turned stream off ages ago.
quite literaly
Am I the only one that answers the weekly questions?
[19:57:14] --ChanServ-- You are not authorized to perform this operation.
the battles in planetside 2 are endless
lol
There are weekly questions?
^
Hi bronies/ponies! :)
OH'
NVM
Yeah, the weekly questions are a thing.
There are none here.
Am I the only one that follows the P3 show?
Saxy's supposed to be posting them every week but he's been slacking. Also he isn't here right now because he's moved his energies to school.
at the dropsuit collector
selector
Because reasons.
I believe that you can't make ChanServ kick someone from a channel unless you are an AOP for the channel with a level 5 access level. At least that's by default. I don't think being an oper changes that requirement.
:P
Whats up friends?
I think this is more escalated war rather than a battle
brb
Just my opinion
^
Could depend on the server software too.
end*
Damn you Close Quarters DLC...
and i second that statement
your*
gameplay>graphics for me, but i disagree with not giving games credit for good graphics, it takes a lot of effort to do that too
battlefield?

then I disappeared from IRC for a few years
you guys should just change teams
i didnt die
Yeah, that can happen when you haven't worked with something for a few years.

I dunno how I did it.
i usually get up around 2 pm when i dont have to get up early
I usually do too.
I had to get up at 3 for my job sometimes
I need someone to try to connect to this server

Oooooh
Probably. But I'd rather be banned speaking my mind than hang around as someone scared into line.
Seriously people, If you have something to say then just come Auschwitz it!
Not interested in pointless insults.

0,14yep
that seems to be all she did
2,14 For one: when a mod warns you for something, or you are kicked for behavior: suck it up rather than bitch about it
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/363/539/340.png I find that word hilarious..
I saw no racist jokes...
i remember when it was friendly in here....
Even if said mod is a crybaby?
This place is a place of madness. :>
I think a +m is in order

Val: Fair enough, why's rape a banned word?
2,14 it's not...?
it is though
^
the word shouldnt be used in vain :p
Seems like individual mod's discretion.
why does that word even need to be used in here?
http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/316/781/33e.jpg
The worst those jokes ever come to is a particular scene in a stream
Like that chair bit in Ghostbusters earlier.
And someone says "Rape"
That's it.
reasonable-ish enough? rape jokes are /never/ appropriot
they arent. however
^
there are many other jokes that arent appropriate, but they are allowed
is this rediculousness still gOing on?!
wow
...
Rape jokes aren't just in bad taste, they also demonstrate crude thinking. It wouldn't really hurt to think up something more intelligent to say than yelling "RAPE" every time something even vaguely sexual pops up on stream.
God...damn...
seriously? are we still on the issue with the rape jokes? geez people
Never thought I'd see the day.
Oh lawdy
Well i didnt see that comming :I
It finaly happened...
...Wekk.

And I've been here since last November

You know... it's going to get alot lesser Grammer Nazy in here.
O u guiz. <3
We noticed. You barely ever do.
still though. i want to say that there are other jokes that should be monitored as strictly as rape jokes
He got banned.
thats for sure
Shitstorm finally arrived.
...there goes that
been here since may
never been banned thing
Imo, Val, you guys are very linient, sometimes to the point of being TOO linient. I appreciate it really.
Lol.
this is why i make nice with mods

I'm not espousing an authoritarian, semi-dictator approach to modding. I'm saying that a good balance must be found.
They can really make you mad.
you havent lived if you havent been kicked/banned
Dat,kik
VAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL.
Other things just make you swear or curse.
0,5I disagree, Val
But when you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble, give a whistle!
0,5I have not.
When chewing on lifes grissle, dont rumble, give a whistle
you havent been on IRC for long without being at aleast kicked or banned once
Currently, the scale is leaning too far towards leniency. It wouldn't be a good idea to go all the way to nazi-hood, but it would be nice to see that scale sliding a bit back the other way.
2,14 hence why I said *ALMOST*, LC

No reaction.
Aight. Time to cool off.

Pushover mods are bad mods.
First time I got banned was for 24 hours. Worst 24 hours ever. But enough about that
Absent mods are bad mods.
Selectively-blind mods are bad mods.
...good mods are bad mods
13ponies seeing it?
Yep. :)
bad mods being good mods
We're seeing it, and hearing it.
2,14 I see you trying Rain, but you haven't said anything Dari hasn't already

Dari has done it all
