03do a google search for sony rootkit
I've heard it all
My laptop came with Ew Dreamweaver, and most of the CS2 stuff XD
03as for Adobe, they're evil because they buy other people's software (Cool Edit Pro from Syntrillium, Flash from Macromedia, etc), make a couple minor changes, then sell it for 4x the original price
03plus lag makes it suck too

04true
04the thing is, the majority of networks have ONE good show on air

03that's why you use a TV guide
03I search by show, niot channel;
03-i
04That's why I don't watch TV

13nowadays I only watch TV for Phineas and Ferb, and even that is a show I can watch on youtube anytime xD
03EW THAT SHOW
04Though I love some shows like Ghost Hunters

4On the !pokemon thing anyway
10Coolstorybro
Wat, Barclays
Oh
4Muffin
8more than suspicious
4I was right all along
8the second i saw the OP, i knew it was a scam
4All it took was BachelorDash posting that image and I was more than convinced
8it was OP saying he was from northern europe that did it for me
4Sweden
8they get free health care, so he wouldnt have had to pay for med
8meds*
4Brb, lunch
4They have free health care in Sweeden
4Yeah
4What a fucking prick
8yeah, like i said in my post, on the internet, its guilty until proven innocent
8but i do feel bad for the people that got suckered in
4He got money from us
4Sure, he didn't get the total amount he was asking for, but he still got money from fellow bronies
4This is easily the most despicable thing I've seen /co/ do in a long time
8its also a felony
8i hope he goes to jail
4Agreed
1pm Hooh?
8im sure the mods reported his IP
4I'm sure others reported his email as well
4We have his alias apparently
4I actually want to raid /co/ now. I know it wouldn't be the right thing to do, but I seriously wanna punch the guy in the face
8dont raid
8looked up the u.s. code
8he would be guilty of wire fraud, which has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison
4Yeah, I just literally saw your post
4And I wonder if he's still posting in there
8i reported my post to make sure the mods see it too
4I'm finally in /co/, lurking to see if the douche is gloating
heya Skylands
how's things?
10Fine, you?
4Heya guys
8i dont even want to go to 4chan
Ohai Aero
WB Hooh :P
4I feel dirty
4Thank you :3
4And I didn't even donate
I've been great, thank for asking ^^
*thanks
10No prob
8remember the other day when i said i didnt hate 4chan, i just preferred ponychan?
8well now i hate 4chan
8Soldier text wall
8as usual, pretty much said exactly what i was thinking
8man, fuck
8i get back from work and this is the 1st goddamn thing i see on ponychan
4Actually, the thread that started the attack has a lot of /co/mrades being pissed off at Faceless
4And Faceless is the one who did the scheme
4They also came to our thread and apologized for his bullshit
8i saw that
4And of course Soldier decides to intervene, because he feels he can save the day
/me 4sits in the silence
8im always ok with Soldier posting his text walls
4Bleh
8you dont like Soldier?
4No
8really?
4Nope
8hes one of my favorite posters
4He's the biggest attention horse on the site
13why does this amuse me so much http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0Li7gRh6go&feature=related
8i see no problem with that

8im a huge attention horse too
8and his posts are usually very good
8and the advice he gives is top notch
06Lol
06because it's simple and unexpected c:
4Ponychan is an imageboard, and on imageboards people post in short posts because we're trying to have discussions. What Soldier does is essentially post a page's worth of stuff that then swiftly diverts attention away from whatever people are talking about to showering praise to him for saying some pretty words and seeming humble
13!espeon
/me 13floofs Espeon
wut about the rest of us
we want floof too o3o
8i see no problem with that, because the stuff he writes is usually worth talking about
8and its not like hes writing the praise for himself, thats coming completely from the community
13SS, if you want to be floofed you must beg for it ;3
/me 13runs
/me begs for AE's floof o3o
4If you think so, I can't believe that he basically took hundreds of arguments and debates between fellow ponychanners, pretty much copy pasted the entire thing into a post, organized it, and slapped his name up on the post and got it archived
13good boy ;3
4And people cherished HIM
4Not others who actually came up with it
<3
X3
8i know him well enough that it sounded like those were his own words and thoughts
8also, N is starting shit on /oat/ now
8so much drama todau
8today*
/me 4bird floofs everybody
/me floofs someone
4http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l06033Et5f1qabwuqo1_500.jpg
4In any case, I feel lower now
4And Faceless is just lapping it up
06o.o;
4This calls for a floof fight
06And reminds me of that floofy Lugia and Ho-Oh picture.
8eh, whatever
/me 4grabs both the Espeons and throws them at someone
8like ive said before, i dont really care what people on other sites say about us
/me ducks
/me 13flies across the chat? o-o
/me dodges
/me somersaults above
10o.o

/me phases out of existence
10Too much floof that it's disgusting @ link
4Yeah
4Curly floof isn't that awesome
06whoa at first I didn't see the second cat
10Doesn't look like they brushed their cat very well
4DOUBLE FLOOF ALL THE WAY
4And, unfortunately, people on ponychan are just gonna let it be
hey guys
4Seriously, people are gonna tolerate this
4Hello Bristle
8hi bristle
7Just thought I'de check in, luckly your here, can't attend on Friday, it's my fathers birthday and I have to do stuff with him
4Alright, Bristle
8thats ok
7cool
8also, did you catch the drama on /oat/?
7The dontation thread that was a scam or something?
8yeah
7I saw the thread, but didnt read it
8and now N is starting shit about furries
7who is N?
8basically what happened is somepony from /co/ pretended he was sick, got $90 in donations before he was exposed
4I got flak for calling foul on the OP, but people WERE WHINING ABOUT WHY I DIDN'T TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUST HIMMMMMMMMM
8N is basically a resident parasprite
7Wow, jesus /oat/ but I'lle be back got to go to a dentist appoinment
8hes a fairly regular user, but hes kind of a dick
4At least N is OUR resident dick
8alright, see ya later bristle
4I don't think he'd stoop to the cockstain level that Faceless did
8no, he isnt that big of a dick
8oh, btw, was sprinkles able to get the stream working without lag?
4It's like Hal Rocker, I don't like the guy but he doesn't cause trouble
4Much
4Yeah, he figured it out
4The video's a little fuzzy, but there's no lag
o.o
8cool beans
I love that picture ;p
8also, im gonna send out an email to DCD, why did you want him in here tonight?
And terrible
Floof gone wrong
4So he can give advice to Sprinkles
4About the pre-show and post-show
4And also about where to get the movies
8ok
8also, im gonna ask him if he can drop by to talk about astray
4Sounds good
8cuz i think it would be better if we all told him how we felt individually
10<insert more silence here>
8instead of me just writing "none of the other mods like him"
13!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"

06nom

8i mean, i know he's DCD's friend and all
4How dare you nom in front of me
13I'm gonna be havnig feesh fingers for dinner
8but giving full op to a non-brony who is an obvious parasprite will not end well
13inb4 someone takes that out of context
4Jesus, I actually finally realize that despite just how much I dislike Ponychan it will always be better than 4chan simply because of Faceless' actions
13xD

10Iceburd
8you dislike Ponychan?
4I dislike the way how the majority of people on Ponychan throw out common sense for love and tolerance
4That scam thread is my evidence
4But despite all that, I realize that Ponychan is the more mature site because we haven't stooped to 4chan's level yet
4Santaburd
8i find the love and tolerance aspect refreshing, even though people shouldnt have been as trusting as they were
10I misread that for Satanburd
/me shows no sign of fear
4Delvibird used Evil Delivery!
4God, and then 4chan is completely devoid of common sense too
4Because it's OBVIOUSLY so much more goddamn adult and mature to steal someone's money
8people are stupid
8its been 2 days since i put a thread on /meta/ arguing that /oat/ and /chat/ should be combined, or at least reconfigured
8mods still havent responded to it
4Looks like I killed everybody

4Heya Nick
10Espy, when do you want me to give you that link by the way?

12Awesome
EWWWWWWWWW PONY URL
4Listen to it
8Pretty sure Nature Blossom just got banhammered
8what is with all the hate and drama on /oat/ today?
4Faceless
4Faceless honestly started a shit storm is that is still festering long after he left
6>>;
6I dislike hate and drama.
4Why was Nature Blossom banned?
8me too, bro, me too
8i dont think he was now, actually, but he had a bunch of post deletions
8he might get banned yet though
4What for?
8he told Angel The Bunny to "go eat shit and die"
I dont listen to pony crap Hooh
8and is generally writing a lot of very angry stuff in that Haackula thread
4Well
4Angel is a complete douche, it's hard not to get angry at him
4I c
4I mean, I agree with a lot of what he says but he's even worse that I am at social ettiquette
8well, it was based on this screenshot: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130817260132.png
6I've never really read any of Angel's posts.
if its crap i dont listen to it, ponies are crap
;P
8ah shit, thats tiny
6But I know Haack has anything and everything coming to him.
get the picture im drawing :P
6You can pop it out, silly.
8basically Haackula posted a screenshot of Angel The Bunny congratulating Faceless
4Yep
12Floof~
6mfw
6:/
4But Angel is apparently trying to reason with Ponychan that he's not defecting or some shit
6I say if he wants to defect, let him.
6He'll be back anyway.
6They always come back.
8its like i said in that one thread after the Cupcakes shitstorm, if people dont want to be here, they dont have to
8they should consider whether or not this is the right community for them
4And that thread is still mocking us
8*shrug* like i said, i dont really care what 4chan thinks of us
6Which thread is this?
/me 6is forgetful
8thread in /co/ about the scam
6Oh.
6I saw that.
4It's a new thread now. Faceless decided to make a new thread and an anon is mocking the ponychan mods over in meta
4He linked the thread and all
8also, Background got banned for 24+ hours for posting a parody of the scam thread asking people to donate to animal shelters
4Too slow, Hip : /
8no ones mocking the mods in that thread that i've seen though
4It's a new thread Faceless made
6Oh look at the pretty thread in meta.
4Someone is mocking the mods in it
8send me a link to the /co/ thread
8the faceless thread
4We don't need to keep this shit going, Hip.
8no no
4They're trying to stop talking about it
8i want to see if its something i should bring to the attention of the mods
6...My muffin is gone.
6Good thing I have three more~
4Ahaha. Look at the ponychan mod staff failing some more.
4That's literally all it was
8sprinkles, i am jelly
8oh ok, i misunderstood
/me yawns
8i thought you were saying faceless had posted a thread where he was encouraging people to go make fun of the mods on /meta/
4Sorry if I worded it weirdly, he wasn't doing an outright attack or anything. Just pointing and laughing, and even then he was reprimanded by a fellow /co/mrade for trying to stir more shit up
4Y hallo thar
6>worded weirdly
6>half the problems on the internet
6>i.e. last night with Peanut and !!Scootaloo
13made me yawn :<
06better?
/me 13hugs back :3
13Much better~
4Let's not go into that, I still feel sore over that bullshit
4Floofhug
8wait, what happened with Peanut and !!Scootaloo?
8just type it out, i will be afk for about 10 mins
4Hold on
4Hold on
4Hold on
4Wait
8but ill read when i get back
4Everybody stop talking for a moment
06:3
13!espeon
12Hi Angel Espeon
13ohai :3
4SCRIPT
4Y U GIVE ME NO ESPEON
06No sharing~
13:3c
/me shares her bree self with someone
With me? :P
10Sure
06-eons everywhere
Good :3
4Okay
6...?
4But seriously, Peanut pissed me off last night
4I felt disrespected
6It wasn't really Peanut.
6It was legitimately !!Scootaloo.
4What?
6BlazingStarshine IS !!Scootaloo
4!Espeon
4Nuuuu
6She just said she was trolling to try to keep people off of her. Since people aren't really supposed to know.
4Purple cats are the best
4Wait, you just said Peanut was !!Scootaloo but now you're saying Blazing was !!Scootaloo
6...Peanut is not !!Scootaloo.
13;3
4Read what you said up
6I'm saying Peanut didn't really do anything wrong.
6>worded weird
4i even spent a week getting a global link espie
4All I know is that I felt absolutely disrespected by both her and Peanut
4I felt threatened, and that's not fucking fair
6It was quite rude.
13I'm still waiting for mine |D
06It's totally worth it.
06Insert pun about magically bouncing here.
4Seriously, !!Scootaloo can go fuck herself
6She lost major respect points with me last night.
4Magic Bounce + Espeon = yes
4I've never once had an issue with the mods, but she completely lost any respect from me
06That is a pretty fun ability though.
12bbl
6I usually like the mods. The fact that she went and did that was just absolutely... no.
06Ok
4But Peanut exacerbated her attitude
4Both acted like total douchebags to me, and while I can't say anything to !!Scootaloo about it, you better believe Peanut's gonna get a textful from me
6I'd agree he did go overboard with it, but it seemed more like he was just poking fun.
6I could see how it could hurt feelings though.
4Maybe he was just having fun, but no one apologized to me
4Neither of them did
4Bye1
Alright I'm back!
4*!
4WB Bristle
6Hey Bristle.
7I have one thing to say, Fuck the Dentist
6That is a statement I agree wholeheartedly with.
4Oh shit
4Now N really is asking for a banhammer
6...though I'm sure if I went to the dentist any time soon I'd get so many fillings that I'd have enough metal in me to qualify as being an android.
7Lol I saw N's thread, Obvious troll is obvious
8yo, what exactly happened?
4N is asking to be banhammered
4Seriously
6Parasprite detected.
6I need to find a tuba.
4Go to /oat/, Hip
4You'll see it
8i see the N thread
8what was the peanut/!!scootaloo thing about
6The N thread is in /oat/? I'm looking at one in /meta/
13ohai Kosoveon :3
8also, my feelings on the N thread are in my post
4I can't speak to you about it, Hip, otherwise I'll be banhammered
8tell me here
8mods cant reach you here
7If he wants to fight and parasprite, why not got to /co/?
6We found out who !!Scootaloo is outside the modtag.
6Well, she told us, rather.
/me flooooofs
6Then she decided to tell us she was trolling us and wasn't really !!Scootaloo.
/me 13is floofed o3o
4She threatened me
6Obvious !!Scootaloo was obvious, though.
4And acted like a complete douche and disrespected me
8I have very mixed feelings on !!Scootaloo
4And Peanut exacerbated her attitude
4And pissed me off more
8sometimes he/she posts good or funny things, sometimes he/she is a complete asshole
8same deal with !!Twilight
8the other mods i like a lot
4Listen, if you read the text log from last night you'd see Scootaloo was acting like a total fucking bitch
06Floof chain reaction
/me makes a generator taking advantage of this
/me millionaire
/me guinea pig
/me sad
8oh, i believe you
/me 13happyface
7Jeez Ghosties, she must have really fucked with you
/me 4shaves Espeons for floof
4She pissed me the fuck off, Bristle. I have never felt disrespected by a mod or from Ponychan but she changed that real goddamn quick
13;-;
6She was being quite rude.
06That's illegal.
8what was she saying
8?
8paraphrased
7Yeah, what did she say
6That she would ban us if we told anypony her identity.
/me 4goes to jail for Espeon shaving
6Hence why I haven't said.
4!Pokemon
4It went beyond that though
Hooh54, you are a 12Audino.
6Even though SHE told US.
4She was a complete prick about it
8but wait, how did you find out?
6She told us.
8was it on a thread?
6Flat out told us.
/me 4gets out of jail with Audino powers
4Because Peanut let it slip
6Nope. In here.
8oh, ok
06space jail
4I found out from Peanut
4Who had mentioned having tabs on three mods earlier in the night
6I found my tuba, btw.
4And then spoke to Scoots as if she were a mod and I deduced from there
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 10Groudon.
8i cant entirely blame her for that, but she shouldnt have been an ass about it
Again
/me 4gets out of space with Groudon powers
6He specifically said "You, Spike, and ..." when listing mods.
Why
!pokemon
06!pokemon
Espeon, you are a 4Tauros.
/me 13is infinitely floofy to begin with
7So on a lighter note, how bout that dude who changed his name to Rainbow Dash
/me yawns
13!pokemon
04I took a NAP
06Infinite floof finite volume
8because i think the mods can get fired if they disclose their identities
4So basically when I figured it out, Scootaloo threatened me and was a complete douche about it EVEN AFTER I specifically told her I wouldn't blather her identity to Ponychan
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 9Grovyle.
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 14Pinsir.
10Yay
Cool :3
/me wtfs at self
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 5Parasect.
06What
04Guys I took a 3 hour nap
04at 3:20
6Yep.
04PM x.x
06lazy
lololololololololololol
Creepy
4I once got an Espeon, it was screencapped
06I did too, and it was in purrple. But it's in logs somewhere.
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 10Vespiquen.
6She was a douche to me even after I said I really didn't care who mods were outside their modtags.
06Intentional misspelling
06Or rather, what the real spelling should be
06:D
/me ~
;3
/me ~~
4"Purrpul"
4And Peanut basically backed her up with the same shitty attitude
Sillyspeons
4Purrrrrrrrrrr
4I had never seen Peanut act like a prick, but he did last night
7If Peanut gets on the Mumble at some point, he is getting a verbal fist
/me 13purrs
as floof approaches infinity, Angel Espeon approaches 1
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 14Braviary.
8what is it with peanut and the mods?
7FROM MY MOUTH
8he has a weirdly close relationship with them
6FLUTEROLL SUCCESSFUL
8PEANUT IS !!CELESTIA
06Get lost in floof vortex-day is best day
06Yeah
7WHAT!
7!?!?!?!?
8no
/me unleashes Katamari Flareon
8im pretty sure !!Celestia said he didnt post regularly
8also, i think peanut is still in high school, theres no way he would be qualified to run a site
6Aww... the silly parasprite isn't responding to my post.
8sprinkle, where did u fluteroll?
4!pokemon
Hooh54, you are a 5Marowak.
4AGAIN
6GET thread.
8ah
7Maybe Peanut just talks to the mods, or knew one or two of them before they were mods?
6The person it was intended for got the reference, too. XD
6I talk to mods, they're not my friends.
6I talk to like, 3 of them on ponychan on a regular basis.
4Peanut has the mods on tab
!pokemon
Nick, you are a 13Bayleef.
4SO I guess he's friends with them or something
6Exactly. I can't go that far.
4!POKEMON
Hooh54, you are a 12Tropius.
7Speculating is hard
8i know a little bit about the mods
8i know !!derpy lives in england
7ENGLAND!?!?!
8and i know what types of music they like, for the most part
8for the record, !!Derpy is a total hipster like me
6I speak to !!Spike a bit since he wanders the GET threads every now and then. And I talk to !!PinkiePie when I see him, though I haven't for a while.
4Oh god, and Amonisis is now making a thread about what happened today
4Jesus
8i told him he shouldnt, but oh well
6*facehoof*
8pretty much
7He's still awesome though
8i like him though
4Yep, Bristle, that's pretty much Amo
6I have no issue with Amonisis. Don't know him well enough to say either way.
4I used to dislike Amo with a passion
7I say let him do what he wants, the thread looks like it's going pretty well anyway
06cats killed the chat
8Amonisis is basically the "good angel" on the shoulder of ponychan
7Who's the bad one.....
4Too much floof
8The observer?
06never
8maybe Whelp?
7Lol maybe, the Observer makes me laugh, and he's easy to beat, you just got to love him
13Never enough
4True
4N
7I'm gonna be honest, I've never really talked to Whelp but he seems like a prick
4N!o is probably the bad angel...well
/me yawn for real now though
4Actually no
8Whelp can be an asshole sometimes, but sometimes hes pretty cool
4We don't really have a truthfully "bad" angel on the site because mods would banhammer them so swiftly that they'd still be typing their messages as they were being kicked out
7Pretty much
lol I just yawned there too thinking about it
13that makes me yawn every time :<
8maybe Haackula
06Good, because cute c:
06But yeah
06good night
06:3
4Night :3
good night
13Nighty night~
6I dislike Haack.
10Yawning in contagious
6He's a troll if there ever was one.
7Haack is just silly
6And not the good kind of troll like me. The annoying kind.
8hes a complete and total parasprite
:3
Nii
8sometimes i can tolerate him, sometimes i just want him to leave the site
6It's when he starts going "Doesn't this belong in /boardnamehere/" that bugs me.
6It's like, no, it belongs in /oat/, deal with it.
7Am I the only one who only really dislikes one person on Ponychan?
6I have no dislike towards most ponies.
6I tolerate most of them.
7Only one man, Hal rocker, fuck that guy
6That. Guy.
6I DISLIKE that guy.
10Pipe'd
6With ALLCAPS and everything.
4HAH, Hal
7He's such an asssssssss
4I hate that he posts himself for every post
7Yes, that is like, Attention horse over 9000
12Wb
4He's pretentious and full of himself. I mean, really, who the fuck posts pictures of themselves on an imageboard? Even if Ponychan is a board that is dedicated to love and tolerance and all that, you don't see anybody else doing it
6Most ponies are tolerable because they only have a few flank moments here and there.
7Thanks.
6He is like... UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
8lol
7Sometimes, I don't understand how he can even watch the show, he's that much of an ass
6...nice Hipster.
6Way to respond to the N thread.
Haha
4Speaking of people who don't watch the show
8talking about the /meta/ thread, i assume?
His router was unplugged :p
6Yeah.
7Yes Ghosties?
6The one where I'm waiting for him to respond to me.
8astray?
4Yep
8what about him?
4Oh wait, you already spoke to DCD about him. I guess he doesn't need to be brought up
8yeah
7astray? whos that?
7Explain
8dont worry about it bristle
6If you don't know, you don't want to.
8hes a dick
8hes one of DCDs IRL friends who came by to help us get a stream set up last night
6It was like dealing with somepony from /b/
8while he was doing that, he was also talking about sexually abusing minors and calling us gay for liking ponies
7Then....why the fuck was he here?
6To train us to stream.
8DCD asked him to help with technical stuff
6Thank Celestia we shouldn't have to deal with him now.
8but he will be dropped down to half-ops
7If he hate ponies, why help his PONY liking friend, set up a BRONY stream?
8lol i dunno
7what a dumbass
8and DCD assured me that he wont be paraspriting us during the streams or anything
8he said astray will only come in if he specifically asks him to come in for a reason
7man /oat/ sure is boring today, (besides the whole donation thing)
6And then N was a parasprite.
13My mum is watching that silly Paris Hilton BFF thing
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
13The whole concept for the show is just pathetic LOL
ewwwwwwwwww Paris Hilton
6I'm not clicking that spoiler Hipster.
6I know what it is.
8sprinkles, you might enjoy that post
7link?
8i want him to click it
6I know it's a flute.
8even if he doesnt get it
7FLute?
4ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
8i just fluterolled N on the /meta/ thread
7lol inside jokes are inside
6...you weren't here for Fistfull of Dollars, are you?
6*were you
4Deeper, you mean
7lol no idea what a fluteroll is
8ive actually fluterolled people in a few threads and had a fair amount of people get it
6Yeah, you would have had to have been here for Fistfull of Dollars to get it.
8its a spoilered pic of a flute
6Quite a few people seem to get it, actually.
8its like rickrolling, but with a flute
10Paris Hilton lul
/me is reminded of Dane Cook's jokes
6I love getting to post the OC somepony made about me.
8lol
6Proof that I am a good troll.
8saw that
8also, the reason the filename is "can" on the flute is because i renamed the file to fluteroll !!PinkiePie in the can thread yesterday
4Basically, whenever a flute plays around Clint Eastwood, you better fucking run
o-o
Who?
4God help you if he's near barrels too
6I renamed mine to numbers.
6Back when I got you.
8im gonna do that eventually
12Hi Hooh
8makes it less obvious
12/late
10Dane Cook is a comedian, HML
6The 300x300 dimensions makes it obvious too.
8it doesnt help that flutes are the only things i ever spoiler
Never heard, but okay
10ESPY

7Feelsgoodpony.jpg
6The spoiler didn't work.
6So it shows the flute.
6RAAAAAAAAAGE.
4I forgot by who, but they were specifically targeting /b/ and opening up their Ddos to the rest of the net
10My life is complete

13Mecha Kyubey in the background LOL
6That is pure win.
4In any case, Ponychan goes back to hugging and reassuring one another while /co/ goes back to calling each other fags and mocking Ponychan. All is as it should be
6...Bristle left.
Whaa
4Yeah, he left about twenty minutes ago
Cool
:D
/me 6wasn't paying attention
4I like the cat thing in the background
6Also, N needs to respond to my trolling him.
That is Kyubey
Evil little thinng

4True
Does Kyubey talk?

4Hug it
10Want that
6Yeah, the chat eats posts sometimes.

4Only for 44.00
8fluteroll successful
4For a small plush >.>
/me waits for HML to return from dinner to show a clip of Kyubey for his voice
12http://aikoudo.com/goods_en_jpy_3802.html

6On /meta/, I assume.

8yeah
6Yeah, saw that.
together, we are The Dudes
6Decided to continue lightly trolling.
da dudes
are you working right now?
yeah still working
8also, im disappointed the mods havent responded to my /meta/ thread yet
4Pokemon Canvas plush are a bit smaller than your fist yet they cost like $70, but mostly because they are imported from Japan
Still night shift and all?
8ive had to bump it 3 times already, and they still havent posted anything
got to pay my toy bill
yeah
10Yes, and they're on high demand since PC closed in NYC
6You're surprised by this?
you guys still play black and white?
p+P
I haven't played it in ages D:
4I want the Ho-Oh Pokedoll but the thing's like over 50 dollars .-.
Me either
still haven't beaten the Elite 4
i gave up after i got a dratini in the dream world
dream world sucks btw
I never did get around to trying it
10Ohai
4Also
not missing much by the sounds of it
4http://images.puella-magi.net/f/f4/The_faces_of_Kyubey.jpg
6Also, I agree with your most recent post in the thread.
8well, usually they respond fairly quickly
10I know how you feel
I think the Eevee I put in there when it first came out is still there
XD
XD
8its been like 2 and a half days though
10Old pic is old
poor guy can't wake up
8which thread?
^
argh fuck
shadowfire is down
and umbreon was it?
or no
she killed a poor umbreon once
6The one about /chat/ and /oat/
it was being DDoSed about a day ago
Is that a good thing.
xD
all I know for sure is that her Chansey is evil D:
I can't get it back up atm
your telling me
no SSH access as I'm at school
/me stares
D:
I don't kill umbreons
cept that one time
8ah, yeah
:P
/me 4stares at Kyubey
8it just seems like such an arbitrary distinction to make
brb, I have to figure out my loans for next year
oh, okay
12Hello
6It really does.
4Hi :3
6And I get tired of my threads getting moved to /chat/ and dying because the intended audience doesn't see them.
uh oh... loans
6i.e. the !!Rarity appreciation thread.
dun dun DUN
I need to take care of one of mine from this year yet
6Though !!Rarity saged it after a while because the mods decided they don't want attention.
I need to pay interest before it builds
right now I only have to pay 70 something
student loans or car loans
so I better get it out of the way soon while it's only that
;3
student loans

10Long scene, but his voice
No dub?
10Ew no
10And dubs take ages to be created anyway
you guys ever file for the fafsa?
12What about a fan dub ;D
yeah
10Even worse
get much?
I still haven't gotten the results yet though =/
4Make him have the deepest voice ever
o-o
4Scary
last year I barely got anything
12/sarcasm
That voice
I like how people care
Needs more testosterone
10Kyubey has a voice that fits his appearance
wb
i've gotten 1000+ last time
Woah, not bad
4Yep
took care of my tuition but my books are the ones that broke me
yeah, they'll do that
12I can't watch fan dubs, they sound awful
13I love how he just keeps that innocent tone of voice no matter what situation everyone is in
I hate when you have to buy a really expensive book and then you barely ever use it
HML LugiaRP
8exactly
10The same smile as well :3
8it happened yesterday with my "get to know /oat/" thread
13yes xD
13and that scene is awesome
out campus adopted this one bookstore just to raise their credibility but the price went skywards
8which, ironically, i started as a way of bridging the divide between /chat/ and /oat/
4Full of fluff
should have sold some of them too
8and then the mods moved it so that it was more or less irrelevant
our campus has a bookstore too
and the books there are way overpriced
Lol
10No D:
Yes
10Homura gets her own serious voice
EVIL DEMON CATS
Need evil voices
I should redub!
some places have an option for an e-book at half the price

NO THANKS
OH SNAp

;o
NOPE
I USE CHROME AND IE9
YES
.-.
5I think it's sad how easily the phrase "I hate" is used, especially when it's used to talk about a person or a generalized group of people. ):
AND I HAVE WINGS
Masturbating for dummies
CHROME IS A FUCKING DICK
:<
GOOOD
IT'S A FUCKING COLOUR, BITCH
i use chrome for japanese sites

SKYLANDS, GET YOUR VAGINA TO JOIN MY VAGINA ARMY
6Yeah.
;o
5I think they're improving. They have to in order to be competitive.
5And they're cheaper. If you're broke like my family you can't afford a foreign car. ^^;
5So I think it's a combination of things. /shrug
10No thanks
She is my army ;p
10I have my own army
VAGINA VS PENIS, GO! GOOOOOOOOOOOOO TITS!

SKYLANDS LIES
4Soooo we're gonna get people in here?
5Ugh, you're more likely to die driving than in a freaking airplane.

YOU ARE ALL LIARS
/me truth

8yeah
10THE ONLY LIE I SEE AROUND HERE
8theres a possibility
10IS THE
10CAKE
5But other drivers can be such distracted idiots.
around here you're more likely to die by being shot by a Detroit citizen
/me hides
5Every time I go walking I nearly get hit by some jerk on the road.
She is my bitch :)
10:3
Skylands, sit~

ALTAIR ISN'T MANLY ENOUGH FOR MY TASTES
10He raped you with his hockey stick
5It's the ONE THING I can't stand about the city I live in.
his hocket stick doesn't exist
I ate it with my vagina
You coming in here, with your new graphics card, and your new RAM.
5Texting while driving is illegal here, too, but only as a secondary offense.
:o
Teeth
YOU MUST BE A MAN-WHORE!
5Like they have to catch you breaking the law some other way.
yeah
EW NEW GPUS

ALTAIR IS A MAN-WHORE, WHAT YOU SHITTING, IDIOT
Anyway, derp

8interesting
not chocolate

10I can't trust you either way
):
She ate girlfruit
I liked TF2
10She ate mangos

5xD
WINDOWS 8 MANGO

/me slits wrists and runs off
/me laughs at NS' crying
OH DAMN

unlike most people here
/me screams
10That's right
Sorry, suddenly busy as hell with daily /oat/ stuff

finally someone who agrees
10Take the pills NS
sexy girls ftw though
/me runs
Same here lol

5If they actually had BRAINS maybe.
11Hipster, I put a post in requesting an email from all reporters. Give me your Ponychan name (just in case), the sections you cover, and any news that you might have written about from this past week.
my rule on animatd films these days
5Like Zoe Saldana~
10DO IT

10No time to waste
Ooorrr

/me puts NS in A Clockwork Orange
THIS SHALL MAKE HER BETTER
5HTTYD was terrible imo. D:
:D
rofl
PILLS HERE!
10also I like how in chatstats you two were talkign to each other the most yet
Hot ;3
5Zoe Saldana is a fabulous, beautiful actress. She played Uhura in ST09.
10HML talks to me more than NS according to stats
I liked it, but I wasn't obsessed like most people here
oh
she's not that hot imo
but w/e
Good ;3
I'm not a Megan Fox fanboy either
5Haha, I think if I was a guy I'd admire her.
5But I dunno.
4inb4 the scam gets top story
5EW MEGAN FOX
10But then liek
5SHE IS..
10Skylands likes chatting with:
10NS
hottest actress ever imo is Isla Fisher
10HML
10etc
which is creepy
>:
5AUGH I CAN'T because I'll get kicked. xD;;;;
as she's like 30
6inb4 BMN becoming more awesome is more important
5Why is that creepy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faML0QvVb2A
THIS IS YOU
because she looks like a teenager?
5I have a major crush on a bassist who's 57. /runs
10Just what we were waiting for
5Some people look young. ^^;
actually she's more like 35 but w/e
11Unfortunatly, I can't be biased with my reports. I'll have to put the news in about these other streams as well. Professionalism and whatnot.
10Bad stuff in stats
and LOL
lmfao
6XD
5BUT HIS HAIR
10wat
Hot
5IS AMAZING
/me sucks
6I was kidding, obviously.
;3
6Besides, bias is fun.
10Also imagine if Shiny was here
Ohgod
4I wanted to talk about exposure for us, actually
5and his hands as they dance over the fingerboard, oh my gosh, he's so talented. ;w;
Death
11I know, but I'm not feeling too well and not so I'm kinda slow on catching jokes.
10Nuuu
10Those are not for you
5Er, hand, I guess. xD The other one's over the strings of course.
Clockwork Orange, lol.
Yes they are :>
inb4 rush
6Here's how you know.
XD
That movie was lul
6Is it me talking?
5YES haha.
4DCD, Sprinks and I were talking about expanding the BMN to places like Twitter and the like and at first I thought it was a great idea
10For our kids silly
5Geddy Lee.
thought so
6If so, it's probably a joke.
5<3
Forgot :p
Silly me ;3
5You're learning. xD
10NS is our adopted daughter btw
/me yawns
yes, I've learned to hate fangirls :P
Can we abuse her?
10You can
Or at least give her the meds
):
11I put regular reports of BMN on the Brony Facebook. Which reminds me, I have to do that now.
5At least he's talented. Unlike Justin Beaverface.
10That's what father's do, right?
5He's /worth/ fangirling over.
10Abuse their daughters
eh
11SO you're joking that it's a joke? :P
Spanks
NS lieks
I just don't like fangirling in general
>:
5I don't fangirl unless they're /worth/ my attention. xD
I keep my crushes to myself :P
6Or am I?
5What's the fun of that? (;
4Well, in response to that, I started realizing that streaming movies we didn't procure by normal means may get us royally fucked in the future
6You never know.
6Except that you do.
no
6That's the joke.
they fuck their daughters
5But lol it's okay. xD I actually respect you for that.
/me roll
I lost the game
fantasizing in private?
10That too
/me runs
5LOLOL
ps i want the video.

5Well when you put it /that/ way...!
yespls
;P

I plead the fifth
U :P
/me fucks Skyla with tits
Hot

5(besidesmyheartbelongstoneilpeartnotgeddyleebutumANYWAYS...)
6brb guys
11You mean you're worried about us getting smacked around for anything illegal we may or may not be doing.
4Yes
who
*kit
/me is no longer hyper
6Except we get everything legally.
also god that took forever to read
5Neil Peart! Percussionist for RUSH.
Good
:3
4And expanding is a bad way to gain unwanted attention
10I'm sure NS will be at it all night though
oh
5ANYWAYS. xD;
my heart belongs to LL :P
5So are you seeing any good concerts or anything this summer?
8Silver, I don't think I can do the daily /oat/ anymore
5(inb4 aw! :3)
I might see another Weird Al concert
11Because of your busy schedule?
5Dude that would be so epic. O:
8im going to be super busy here pretty soon
6Yeah, BRB guys, have to go get pizza
4P I ZZ A
8cya sprinkles
Who wants to make a random Shoutout?
4See ya in a bit
5Cheap Trick and .88 Special are coming to Omaha for a FREE 4th of July concert omigosh I'm so excited yaaaay~
11DCD has claimed he has "ways" of getting movies. I would say it's pirated/free downloads, but I'd rather not ask.
4But how are we getting everything "legally?"
For the enjoyment I anticipated experiencing after performing said activity?
XD
5And I live BLOCKS AWAY from the venue. 8DD
8I will probably have to put in more hours at work once the contact period starts
I filmed the last Weird Al concert I went to
What Dari?
8ghosties, dont worry about it
8we'll be fine
www.youtube.com/WeirdAlConcert
11Understood. What sections did you cover?
creative account name, no?
5Ugh, you're not one of those people who holds your phone up the whole time are you? D:
I used a camera, but maybe :P
Lols
5People do that at RUSH concerts and it's soooo annoying!! They block your view!!!!!! Dx
There was nobody behind me
5Not to mention terribly rude.
empty seat
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
!silence
5Haha, well that's good.
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
plus
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
!silence
/me says "BREAK THE SILENCE!!!!!!!"
I talked to a guy who was at that same concert
who got his camera taken q
Never.
away by securifty
*r
so I feel special for not getting caught
11Um, what time will Sprinkles begin the pre-show?
10Oh lawd
:3
4Whenever he gets to the cafe I presume
Should we?~
4That said, I think he should stream an ep for you guys so you can see what you think about it
5Yeah Michael Mosbach (part of Rush's security team) has like EAGLE EYE for that sort of thing. xD But they've released their last few tours on DVD anyways, so.. /shrug
10and my sample quote doesn't even make sense
4I think the quality is a little fuzzy
10oh wait, that's cuz it is the ASCII art
5(inb4 don't ask how I know who Michael is :X )
bbl
Though the enjoyment that I experience after performing said activity may not live up the pleasure gained from the anticipated experience.
LOL
10We shall @ HML
Stalker
well, Weird Al doesnt
he has several concert exclusive songs
10Bye NS :<
so I taped the one I went to
Bye NS ;o
5Nuuuuuuuu Neil Peart wrote all about Michael in one of his books. I SWEAR I'M NOT A STALKER.
/me makes out with Sky again :o
11alright. and what time did we say we'd stream on Saturdays?
now I have an HD camcorder so ;D
5Haha. The main thing people tape about Rush's concerts are Neil Peart's solos, because each show is slightly different.
Oh well
heh
well
I tend to prefer album versions to live ones, but I like the concert-exclusive stuff
11nevermind. Sprinkles put the post in the thread.
5Live albums are awesome.. sometimes.
too much cheering LOL
5Like "Exit... Stage Left" (yes that is a Snagglepuss reference xD) is a great live album.
and the rock bands I like SUCK live
like Green Day
5Which ones are tho--?
5Oh yes Green Day. Eeurgh.
their albums are awsome but they can't perform live for crap
5Fall Out Boy is terrible live too. D:
Linkin Park is like that too
5I think the true mark of a great band is how they perform live.
well
yes, but, I only care about catchiness LOL
8silver, i was going to cover EQD, /collab/ and /chat/, if i remember correctly
5I care about musicianship. =P
I don't mind processing as long as it's not stupidly annoying (a la T-Pain)
Terrible-Pain (to your ears) :O
but now that they can use autotune live, you never know who sucks anyway LOL
I have to get my hands on this soundtrack.
5Sometimes Rush has pedal-triggered sounds when they do live but that's because they're SO OBSESSED with having it sound like the album.
the only good T-Pain thing is I'm On a Boat

5GEDDY LEE HAS NEVER USED AUTOTUNE. <3
they've used "pitch correction" for years
even for rock.
autotune is just an extreme example of that
5Of course that means sometimes his voice doesn't sound perfect on stage but he's almost sixty freakin' years old!
Metal > rock anyway.
LOL
EW METAL
:O
5Prog rock > Metal
EW POP
:<
the only music I can't stand
EW PROG ROCK
Ew Rap
5D:
/me shot
5HOW
is country and metal/screamo/w/e
EW RAP
5HOW CAN YOU HATE ON PROG. :C
LOL
Hip-hopera is the best
No, metal is best.
What is Prog? O.o
5Prog is like the epitome of rock musicianship!!!!!
Ok, fine, but metal still > prog rock.
4I'll be right back, gotta close my tabs
I don't dislike rock as a genre, there's just so much of it that it's hard to find the good stuff
metal is just screaming >_>
5Prog is Progressive Rock. It uses a lot of odd instruments, mini-moog (yeah!), complex time signatures, concept albums, oohhh it's so good.
5DRF, not the original metal.
LOL
synthesizers ftw
DRF, GTFO if you think that. >__>
well
Metallica is good
but I consider them rock
Synthies :D
Metallica's old stuff was good, new stuff is poor.
5The original metal was actually good. Not like today's metal. Which is cruddy imo.
agreed
stuff like Enter Sandman and For Whom the Bells Toll
5Rush was freaking obsessed with the synths in the eighties omigawd it's like GET ME A GUITAR IN HERE AND GIVE ALEX LIFESON SOMETHING TO DO.
are awesome songs
CoB are awesome.
80s synth pop is amazing
4Alright, back
eh
5Cygnus X-1 is an epic prog song haha~
never been into CoB
My favourite music is 70s and 80s synth XD
How about A7X?
I generally just like anything upbea
t
A7X has too much screaming for me
Afterlife is alright, though.
5http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwNlbqol_8 <--- This is an example of too much synth D: (Sorry the quality's kinda bad. xD; )

8mods still havent responded to my /meta/ thread, do you think i should report it
8?
5That is an example of TOO MUCH SYNTH and not enough bass. D:
can't listen to music now, in class :P
inb4 needs more cowbell
5Oh ha~
5Well later.
Class what?
hello again
5EVERYTHING NEEDS MOAR COWBELL. ;3
I have a night class.
DRF goes to class at 9pm O.o
hi
8-10
Fail
A friend of mine might have get to play in bloodstock (unlikely though).
4I don't know, do whatever you think is necessary
-have*
Hey
11What /meta/ thread?
5I love the part at 1:36 in that video where the line goes, "shouting guards and smoking guns" and the next beat is BANG FIREWORKS. 8D
/me dumps all the links he has found recently.
XD
4I don't remember exactly what it was about
5It's actually a very sad song, lyrically.
the onlgy Rush song I heard is YYZ
that was pretty good
5GYAH
5YOU NEED MOAAR
No he doesn't
:>
Another Hasbro advert with bronies in it (just a text one this time): http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MeKyQplzJj0/TfMLw6DNNUI/AAAAAAAAFvE/ovX-QsHG_zs/s1600/brony-ad.png
didn't they do Spirit of Radio? as that song bugs me
5If you thought YYZ was good you need to hear La Villa Strangiato. (Another instrumental.)
5Spirit of Radio has an epic beginning though~
I hate the beginning
5And some of the lines are--
5WHAT?
and instrumentals ftw
5You were not blown away by the epic riff?
5What song starts with a RIFF?
12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
5That's what makes it epic. xD
I was looping an instrumental of Don't Stop Believin earlier
o.o
5Oh lol
I have one, its very rare
.
I fricking love piano
5That song is so overplayed now on the radio though. ;~;
more than anything else XD
hey
10Loltiming
hi
I'm surprised I didn't ping out just now
we just can't seem to get everyone here at once, can we?
Laptop closed for a minute
:o
5Kind of like Tom Sawyer. UGH GET ME ANYTHING BUT DON'T PLAY TOM SAWYER AGAIN.
oh, haha
What did I miss?
where the heck did RDX go anyway?

8i made a thread basically suggesting that /oat/ and /chat/ either be merged or modified
Logs nao!
/me shot
*mighty
10There's too much, and alot of it is spam
8the pony requirement from /oat/, specifically
heh
8it creates so much confusion
pastebin?
5I would rather hear Lady Gaga for three hours than hear Tom Sawyer on the rock station again. They need to familiarize themselves with the rest of Rush's extensive discography. xD;
10Fine x.x
Lady Gaga is good
5They have over 160 songs. PICK ONE. BUT NOT TOM SAWYER.
Yay Gagafans :3
:>
her music, not her personality
5I do like Lady Gaga.. in small doses.
LOL
Lol
Well..hrm
either way
5Bad Romance is very catchy. Beyond belief.
03ohshitte
there are very few bands I like 100% of.
Weird Al is prolly the only one, and even then it;s more like 95%

5...REO Speedwagon. 8D

Kill ponies
Weird Al loves ponies for sure.
5Nuuuuu

5...hate on the obsessors. /runs
You're a ponytard too :>
/me hides
03goddamn alot of shit
5WHAT
I hate fictional ponies, not real ones
03xD
5I am not.
We lost Zed and RDX... carboard cutouts might suffice.
5I like ponies that actually exist and eat hay and stuff.
^
5They're adorable. :3
I mean MLP though
I can handle that
5Yeah I know. xD
inb4 "I own a horse" meme
Why did everyone go from
Hating MLP
10(This will take a while, just saying)
TO loving it due to a stupid cartoon
:|
I've always hated it
Not everyone did?
Most people still don't like it.
5Actually I don't hate MLP itself. I'm kind of indifferent. But the people who revolve around it like they revolved around HTTYD is irritating!
^
Well the girls did at fkirst :P
I hate HTTYD fanbase
*first
5**are irritating
You hate Aurora :O
the movie was good. Good, not Great
Fan bases for everything suck, get over it. :P
LOL
5Aurora was.. eh.. xD;
nah
Yeah, nice movie :p
6Back
I don't mind her
Yeah.
Silly dragon
5Ugh and they lead to fanwars.
5I HATED THE SCRIPT
5AGHRJKSAL'GKJRA
5DLSK;AGD;A
5DX
What script :O
XD
5HTTYD. xD
What movie? HTTYD?
OH
5The dialogue oh gawd. D|
yeah
I didn't even notice that breasthat

it lacked any THIS IS SPARTA's

which sicks
*u
5And it was so freaking predictable.
same voice actor so...
5Total Gary Stu.
5He even got the girl in the end!
LOL
5And to keep his dragon!
I know :<
nope
5GAWD!
And lost a leg!
u ghey
that's why TS3 was so amazing
HE LOST A PERDICTABLE LEG XD
5Yeah but he got a replacement and it was PERFECT. :|
since it wasn't predictable
But oh well, he should of died
I was all ZOMFG DON'T DIE
Oh wait, perdictable
@ TS
e
5I think he should've died or had a more useless prosthetic.
3
Everyone should always die, it makes good movies.
What is TS again?
4Hey Sprinkles, would you mind streaming an ep of FiM so the guys can get a look at what we'll be dealing with?
5And the entire village/community/etc. was all very stereotypically "Viking" while he had a dorky midwestern-ish accent.
Transporter? O.o
Toy Story
6Yeah, lemme get setup.
Aah, I never saw the 3rd
There we go
I never cry in movies :<
and LOL dari, you're like my friend, he wants everyone to die
5TS3 was surprisingly good. 8D
I have no emotions ;D
hml, should I livestream it?
:P
Hai guise!11!1one
10Alright, done
Sure thing, this weekend :P
/me shakes their carboard hands.
Or Monday
Either works XD
I usually don't cry in movies either but I couldn't help myself
Meh, I don't care :P
/me wobbles and falls over.
10http://pastebin.com/8sFznxtu
I won't spoil the ending but it made me cry.
/me 's hand snaps off
If it was Spyrochat, then no
:P
5I /sobbed/ watching Marley and Me. :C
10Post never expires, have fun
it was like being forced to give up my childhood
Yay for not being in Spyrochat
:P
ew, that movie looks so dumb
I laughed at Marley and me
5 8C
But eh, oh well
11It's not confusion, it's that people don't regard that rule or just barely make it part of a thread. THAT'S what makes /oat/ confusing.
:P
I... I broke RDX and Infamous.
5It was heartbreaking!
Cool!
5Mainly because my dog's getting older and we know she's on her last proverbial ....
So what if <spoiler>
5**proverbial leg
as much as I like dogs, movies about dogs are getting old.
My sisters love them >.>
I liked the movie Good Boy, though
GAH SNOW BUDDIES
Same
as dogs from space ftw :P
5I cried at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows. (The book, obviously.)
XD
Greater Dane XD
10[21:23] <@Sneas> goddamn alot of shit <- But hey, it's activity :3
I HATED that book
I don't like dogs, so dog films have always been old for me. :P
5I was in like 4th grade man, give me a break. D:
And I was scared for the time the dogs nearly got shaved LOL
5:C
same with TKAMB and Tuck Everlasting
I could not stand either
Yeah, but people complain about ponies when there's pretty much no activity otherwise anyway.
5Tuck Everlasting was overrated.
So content does matter.
5But seriously? TKAMB was a masterpiece.
8exactly
10On second thought I should've probably made that expire
5Not as much as 1984 though.
its so boring
10Oh well
5OR FAHRENHEIT 451
1984 was awesome
5DUDE I LOVE THAT BOOK
5IT'S SO GOOD
5<3333333
8but it causes so many headaches for both the mods and users
and f451 tes
*y
8the pony requirement is really poorly defined
10I never meant anything said, so yeah.
5And not to get off of classics but every Stephen King book ever
5YESSS
8and it seems like most people dont really want there to be a pony requirement anyway
LOL
03sex
good god at log XD
10Told ya
5**Stephen
yeah w/e
10Even Altair missed out on the randomness
small keys
5(;
at least this phone HAS a keyboard *cough*iPhone*cough*
/me did too, which sucks ass.
5I have yet to find a modern author (aside from JK Rowling and Amelia Atwater-Rhodes and MAYBE Diane Duane) who I admire more than THE KING.
5I read like the first sentence and I'm HOOKED.
I like Dan Brown, though I don't read, I just saw the movies
and who's Amelia whoever
4How much longer will it take Sprinks? I don't mean to rush you, but I plan on watching an MST tonight with a friend :P
10Anyway, I have to get off the computer now, seeya
6Just a sec.
03D:
6Was having issues with the VAC.
/me hugs Sky
5I've heard of that.
03Bye :<
/me hugs back
:,
5Amelia A-R is a faaaaaantastic YA author.
She left ;e3
/me hugs and steals Sky
5I was so hooked on her books when I was in 5th-9th grade.
<.<
10Technically I'll be MSN but w/e
also, the book City of Ember, is prolly one of my favorite books
the movie is good too but it UINS
er
RUINS THE ENDING
5She writes a lot of great fantasy books.. and she actually writes GOOD vampire novels.
at the VERY BEGINNING
03eggs
EW VAMPIRES
!twilight
15EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TEENAGE GIRL FADS
5But they're not weak vampires. xD
^ appropriate response
poached eggs
5LOLOL
5ulate. ;D
the script is random
Ew City of Ember ;p
HML go di
e
5Amelia published her first best seller when she was sixteen.
Just joking lol
5SIXTEEN.
5HOW MANY SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS CAN SAY THAT. xD
Your point is? ;o
5It was a fantastic book
Her parents co-authoured it too!
/me flees
5and she is three million times the writer S. Meyer is or will ever be!!
5HML, nope. I've done my research on her.
anyone is
5She's just legitimately talented~
5DRF, lol, ain't that the truth haha.
anyway
class ended early
bbl
5The point is Amelia never sold out her books and made a big marketing franchise about it. She's got that artistic (author) integrity I wish more authors had.
5So yeah. xD; Endrant.
DAMN YOU OVERCAST ENGLISH WEATHER
Make me unbable to see lunar eclipse. :(
5Aww. D:
8my god
8my "get to know /oat/" thread is already autsosaging
8its been up for what, an hour and a half?
8oops
8 2 and a half hours
8but still
http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/enterprise_apps/230600173 < Yay
TL;DR
I kicked the cardboard
5Huh.
5Ow. I just did a fist pump in the air and my arm screamed in pain. (Figuratively. D: )
6Sorry it took so long guys, FME didn't save the settings.
5FREAKING VACCINATIONS. ><
6Starting now.
4What do you guys think?
11Hmm...Ghosties was right. The picture is a little fuzzy. But otherwise it's good.
6I can't run it at high res, which is why it's fuzzy.
6I'm working out the kinks a little more.
11Sound is good, no lag.
5... I effectively killed the chat. xD;
5HUZZAH.
6Had to turn up the sound there. XD
6Forgot to turn it up on VLC
That's just destructive.
8quality is slightly lower than DCD's but it'll work
8also, interesting choice of episode
6I just picked whatever my mouse was on.
6I'm actually at my friend's so I can see the quality here.
4See the fuzz we're talking about, Sprinks?
6Yeah.
6It's not horrible, but it's there.
6Friend's never seen the stream and he says it's good enough that it wouldn't bother him. But that may be slightly biased.
8i wish i had IRL friends that would be fine with watching ponies... sigh
11ARGH has given me the secret to the listserv.
5..I predict the chat will be silent until DRF returns~
6I have a few IRL friends that watch ponies.
8cool
8we can make an announcement about that during BMN
/me chews
04:3
5Oh hey, my prediction was wrong.
5YAY.
5xD
5So what's up?
04Working on Flash
5Oh cool. (:
5What's the project?
04:3?
8sprinkles, just got quads in the get to know /oat/ thread
8u jelly?
6Only if they're 3333 or 5555
6They're the only quads I need to get all quads.
6lol they are
11Basically it's a Gmail contacts group. I'll make a new Gmail account for BMN and share the account and password to you mods so we can all have access to it.
You coming here with your Flash CS5. YOU MUST BE A MAN-WHORE!
:o
;p
6Sounds awesome Silver.
04I got Growth to work :3
6Oo >mvw still no person that wanted tripcode
Ooh, cool.
04...
04Today my messages went from 12 to 26
04WTF
Messages on what?
04oh nvm
04it's dA watch stacks eww
8strange
11So I have BMN Listerv to set up, I'm organizing the Daily Oat News team, I'm helping with BMN in general, I'll be in charge of Daily /oat/s listserv, plus I have final projects for AV Editing, Interactive Multimedia, AND Art history, plus participating in /rp/. I'm going to be busy as hell the next few weeks.
8let me post again to make sure he saw it
04Some group asked me to join them cuz of the Flash.
8good god man
6You are a busy pony.
8lol, a tree with central heating
11Plus, fucking DCD has me addicted to my Phoenix Wright ROM that I now have.
8doesnt seem safe
11On the other hand, I prefer this to sitting around my fucking dorm all day playing Incredible Hulk, so it's all good.
8lol
8POPUP
6I wish watching a thread didn't mean popup in the middle of my screen.
6Will have to remember to have any and all threads watched before stream.
11I don't get popup.
11I'm gonna head out of Brony State so I can get my shit organized. I'll be back afterward.
6k
8NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
8the worst episode
6XD
6trolltrolltroll
6I love Apple Bloom, and I'm not even a big fan of this ep.

8did they died?
8check dragonshy and the best night ever for sure
6I plan on it.
6I know Dragonshy works.
6I just dloaded BNE, so it should work.

4Ah, thank you
Alright

4I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A CREATURE FROM THE EVERFREE FOREST, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
4Only Fluttershy

Hmm.
Someone rejoin then enter, it should auto-op now.
Yay.
4Leaving for a moment
8god, i love billy madison
+p?
4Nope, I still need to enter a key
8i hope somepony picks that movie eventually
Hmm, it auto-removes p. O_o
Oh, it can't be set with +s.
Whoops.
Makes the channel private.
6You have to enter the key, silly.
Not sure if it does anything othe than stops it showing up in /list
But I thought dari said we wouldn't need to enter a key for autoops?
I can still see it on your /whois
No, we get ops in this channel, Ghosties.
Yeah, it won't stop that.
Just doesn't show it in /list
Wait, so what does dari's thing do?
Need to sleep.
BBL
He gave us all ops here, basically.
honestly, we dont really need ops for this channel
8bye dari

Go to the GMail main page. It's BronyState@Gmail.com The Password is BRONYMOVIENIGHT ; all caps
6Best. Password. Ever.
6Awesome.
So we just need to add to the announcements to send an email to BronyState@gmail.com if they want news on the event.

4Now, the only way he can complain is if it's about the movies someone picks and even then there's nothing we can do about that
I love that song. <3
6The only thing he can complain about that WE control would be if we say a movie doesn't fit into a category.
4Want me to do it?
6i.e. like we did with Titanic being a B movie. Which it is definately NOT.
Yes.
You know

"Apparently it's free to change your legal name over in Finland, and pretty easy at that. A brony on Ponychan has taken the ultimate leap of pony faith. He is now officially known as "Rainbow Alexsi Dash". "
Finland, crazy place.
LOL
Children of Bodom are Finnish. :>
The Dudesons are from Finland as well.
That's where all the fun people come from.

Haha, thanks, you are too. (:
orly nao?
Lawl, holes in his stomach. XD
The one where they shoot him with the riot shotgun is good though.
Stupid has key.

I think the shotgun punctures his lung.
Damn those Finnish guys are crazy.
i just read the newspapers
there was a Junior Reginal Nerf League
i wonder, if i took my modded 2 guns, load them with explosives, would i win?
LOL

Doesn't turning the opposition into red mist result in disqualification? :P

xD
They set him on fire while he's asleep. XD
xD
huddah huddah huh!
Then he attacks them with a chainsaw.
XD
hey Dari, do you have Skype?
I don't have an account, no.
ah, ok
Wow, I haven't seen this one before.
They rob a bank (arranged with the police) and the police try to catch them.
To 'test' the police's ability to catch criminals. Why are Finnish police so much more fun? XD
i don't know, but that sound hilarious to me xD
hehehe
God damn, you never want to sleep around these guys.

1. Elmo in grouchland, who was suprisingly decent, and made by Ubisoft ô.o
2. Micky's Dangerous Chase, no comment, old as sh!t, stupid as sh!t
Lol.
I used to have quite a lot, but most of them got stolen years ago (sister had a party - invited the whole year group at her school).

and i'm ALWAYS there...and i bite :P
Hahaha.

He just drove through them all and they exploded, there wasn't much dominoes. O_o

The guy puts 11 staples in his stomach, and he doesn't even make any expression of pain. O_o In fact he said "Oh yeah, just like that".
Wow.
oh my, thats gotta hurt

06That's kind of
06disturbing .-.
Considering all that they've done, it is.
06did the one guy lose his thumb in a stunt or something? o.O
yes
he said "two thumbs up"
dumbass
From wiki.
" According to the movie he lost his thumb by the circular saw at the beginning of the Dudesons´ career. The preserved thumb can be seen in Season 3, Episode 7: "The return of Jarppi's thumb"."
06I see o.o

/me tackle hugs Novi
Real life sonic rainboom is win.
I'm thinking of spoofing the Battle Los Angeles trailer for the MLP:FiM pilot
The song eeriely fits the plot... in a way
Haha, go for it.
Johann Johannsson's The Sun's Gone Dim and the Sky Turned Black
sound familar?
Nope.
Oh right, nevermind.
I thought you meant if I'd heard of the song.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPH7LXPZFBo
Listen to the lyrics
now think about that old ponytale
(and yes that is Singapore)
"The Sun's gone dim, and the sky's turned black"
"'cause I loved her, and she didn't love back"
No way. O_o
Think: her = Nightmare Moon
That fits so well, lol.
Yea
Though you've only got about 10 seconds of Luna to work with, are you going to use NMM instead?
Most likely
ohai AE
13ohai :3
The Battle: Los Angeles trailer opens with a slideshow
Imma use screencaps of the old ponytale part from the first episode for that
"There is an old ponytale that cannot be ignored"
"There is a prophency that cannot be ignored"
Nah, scratch the first one

mmhmm
floof owning again
/me coughs
REAL WORMS?!??!??!??!???!??!?
That's really baked bads
BADS
Bacon makes everything better though.
I like to believe that Pinkie Pie puked her pony guts out in that episode
Imagine if Princess Celestia ate those too
Oo;
Then there would have been no series, because it would have just been "Everyone...TO THE MOON!".
And then everyone will somehow portal to the moon
...

>_> Make A pony Channel and keep the Pony talk there please
Fluttershy is too a tree ...
But there's little-no activity here anyway, you guys aren't even talking.
talk about something OTHER than stupid ponies
its getting old
You want to talk about something else, you need to say something to me then.
and some people dont want to hear about ponies 24/7
:P
06I still don't see why there's not a pony channel either way though. And SS now you're being unreasonable :P
she'd like to be a tree
but she isn't
13why do people never listen to me when I tell them/remind them to do something
Yeah, I will.

Lawl, a 'brony' is anyone who likes the show.
It's not a term for being part of a community.
Goooood morning everypony~!
Brony is a stupid word :P
Oh, what makes it more stupid than any other word?
Morning.
13no, it's a label that gets stuck on anyone who happens to like the show
:P
06It really depends on who you ask
hey there xD
well, Im certianly NOT a brony, and im glad im not :P
06which means it's bad and good at the same time I guess

No one understands zombies. :'( I bet they cut themselves.
My favs are of course SweetieBelle, then Rarity and Fluttershy
Same.
Very very very very same.
Eh, Rarity is too prissy.
But I ship Sparity any day of the week.
Every girl likes to get dressed up ^_^ I am a combination of the personalities
Sparity?
In fact Fluttershy makes up a giant chunk of my pony folder.
yeah, I never understood why girls like "dressing up"
...CLOTHES GO WHERE?
Just do ^_^
honestly we shouldn't have to wear clothes. :|
13Nah, they just enjoy having rave parties on minecraft
I'd have absolutely no complaints.
Its winter where I am, even if the world was "clothing optional", I would still wear them
xD
Clothes are overrated.
O_o
winter where you are?
I bet people working in a retirement home will complain.
Melbourne, Australia
13I've decided I should play that game sometime :B
pfft
like that's an actual place
Ooo, do you have an accent? :D
SPEAK WORDS.
Heheee
I dun, you all do.
SHRIMP ON THE BAHBIE.
australia is fake.
?
It's a myth.
It's like Atlantis, or Portland.
Hehe
Are you insaine?
Or Topeka!
*whispers in SweetieBelle's ear *speak your language...
/me speaks "Aussie" for all to hear :P
*shudders in delight* :D
it's an aussie sweetie belle
:$

/me pauses.. *squee*
*gasp* MLP is not multicultural! :P
I SHALL KIDNAP THE AUSSIE ONE AND KEEP IN HER MY CASTLE FAR FAR AWAY WHERE NO ONE CAN HEAR US-- I mean....uhhhh...
I think I am going to have to get some fakie's and make aussie ponies!
NOTHING I SAY IS GOOD!
Stop the all caps
Australia IS far far away :P
Truetrue.
Wait....so is it SNOWING where you are? Or is Melbourne too warm?
But we have no castles...
Its snowing on the alps
Meet in the middle? France?
The snow season started (strongly) about a week ago
Well, middle-ish.
Australia is a wacky world.
Ah, I'm SICK of snow after this winter.
French ponies... Ooooo
I live in scotland..we have crap wheter
You might actually have to fight for my afffections there, miss. ;D
So....do you see kangaroos often, or are they exclusively in the OutbacK?
The French-Australian accent is to die for.
Oh gods did you relly ask that
Yep.
I see wallabies occasionally
sweetie, now I want to hear you talk. :|
SCHWEEET.
and now I sound like a crazy stalker person
which I'm not
it's just that your shirt and pants don't match
Heh
Ive been asked if Australia has paved roads.. Yeah.. Im here on the INTERNET and we dont have paved roads.. Pssh.
Wait, she's WEARING a shirt?.....whose house am I in?!
?
Im wrapped in a coat, its cold here!
In austrailer?
Sweetie, you have roads at ALL?
*hugs her* Shamrock uses SUMMER WARM TIME!
I thought it was always hot
weird
Hemispheres, man. They mess EVERYTHING up.
Hehe
I've always been in favor of the US saying "fuck roads we need wifi all over errywhere instead"
then that'll get people to spend more time inventing flying cars
LOLs
and less human interaction
Australia has every climate except Arctic/Antarctic
Japan has pretty awesome internet.
But crap whether
1000 MB/S I heard, somewhere.
Yeah, Japan has fibre optic to HOME
let's move to Japan
Gods no
Hai.
Oooo, she used "re"....smexy. <3

Is that even a word
We spell it "fiber"
Fiber?
Hehe

Aloha!
So is Doctor Who as popular down under as it is in the US/Britain?
Yep
Down under?
I love that name.
It makes me snicker.
I prefer Dr Whooves though
(Point of interest: I'm actually HALF British. Me mum is from across the pond....but I don't have an accent)
ohai Nick
(My nan does, but my mom lost her's)
Me too! However, I have a partially pom accent, very few can pick it.
Family is from Sheffield
Shweet.
I want to go to Australia, but I'm afraid of dingoes.
I have a pet one
FALSE. You cannot domesticate a dingo.
Well, she is part dingo part shep
That's what I thought.
;D
*pats her head* no need to exaggerate, love.
Oh, you can, but they bite.
I heard they were uber dangerous, mate.
/me blushes
They are.
/me grins, Isnt everything in Australia, or so I hear :P
True...
I REALLY want to avoid the Reef.
http://i49.tinypic.com/2ic74hf.jpg
D'awwwwww.
Well, the reef is getting bleached so you might want to see it while you can
Her name is Jess
Bleached?
The rising water temperature is killing it.
Ah.
That sucks.
They say bleaching as it kills it, turning it white and COLOURLESS :p
Awwww :(
Aussies use excess Us?
cool.

Hi c:
06well, brb food :P
/me 4slides into the chat
How're you?
:3
13Hey there!
I am sooo getting a cutie mark RL
Tattoo?
I have a request for a rule on the topic
"Friendship is paramount"
Yus
Just a lil one
04should get goinig
13Rats! Missed you again...
I wouldn't know what tattoo to get..
It'd have to have a meaning to me but there's nothing like that yet
Thats what I am wondering, make something or get something already made
I am getting a certain star constellation above it.. MMmm
6I'm good.
Something already made would be recognizable
That's good
but there's the risk of getting tired of it xD
Right on time.
'Sup, guise?
nothing much rly xD
<-- Listening to Bronyville.
If the mark means something to me, Ill never get tired of it.
Huzzah for nothing much!
true...
Wow, is it too early in the morning or something?
I guess?
Its something I wanted for a while, a small tattoo.. and since becoming a brony~ette.. Ill make it a cutie mark
I mean I just woke up
Loltastic.
So did I.
So how are these channels divided exactly? This is the random chat? Studies the elitist chat? And then AfterDark and RP are what exactly?
I woke up with no alarm clock exactly at 10:00.
Lol.
General chat, so anything pony related.
6XD
6I would hope so.
Afterdark - apparently still general, but you can bring up adult topics/words
AfterDark is clop, basically.
RP = roleplaying, so get your ponysona on
Revolver: not really.
Well, I don't ever go in there.
So I wouldn't know.
Ew, I thought AD was just a chat for us older folks
Heheh mhm >w<
Well, not unless Fireant's on...
Nope.
Afterdark isn't usually R-18
gingerale: That's kinda what it's billed as
I haven't checked it out though
Oh okay
Hihi ^v^
but the conversations tend to swerve that way
Ah
Talking about doing taxes and the days at jobs? :B
AD is where it's allowed.
Eeep
*at work
here, swerve to R-18
Here it isn't, so people like Fiddler tend to stay here less.
13Hello?
And shaving. Us old guys like to shave. And baking cakes. *nodnod*
and you will be warmed
13DSD?
warned**
I've got this idea for a flash game but I'm not sure what to do with it
Aren't there chan boards you could pitch it at?
Ooh, that reminds meh.
Oh?
Avian: Go on.
I can sprite for an entire game of MLP, but I'm a terrible programmar.
Idk, I here things in ED news posts but I couldn't point you to one.
*hear
I know AS3 for Flash.
After playing around a little in flash cs4 and learning more about AS2 and 3, I came up with an interesting idea for a flash game
Anyone here ever play Harvest Moon 64?
and that is?
Thing is, a RPG is called for, here, as is my spriting style.
Ooh, I did!
I'm aware of the series yes
Hmm..
That was so fun.
played rune factor
factory**
brb, changing computer
What I have in mind would be a crossover between Friendship is Magic and Harvest Moon 64
I work as a junior java software developer.. And I just realized. My work place doesn't have a water cooler.
Complete with simplified dating sim element?
Awesome.
I so did not mean to click that little [X].. then the browser crashed..
Lol.
You play the role of a male work pony trying to turn a defiled farm around
I always just fill a bottle with water instead
Derpys fault!
You can also date one of the mane six
xD
the dating sim element interests me
and eventually marry them
xD
:L
Sounds cute.
Oh yeah
I am meh about this idea.
I should get on my pony game project too
Newrp, sup my bronies.
I'm using OpenGL for rendering the graphics though so I can make all kinds of shiny particle effects for it 8D
greetings xD
I LOVE Harvest Moon 64, it's honestly the perfect fam sim game, or at least would be if it wasn't for all the glitches
Hey rev...
Oh fun. OpenGL in C++ or java?
Java
Combining it with Ponyville would be a great combination
On one hand, dating Applejack would be pretty cool, but then again, watching other people talk about how they married Pinkie Pie would not be 'superfuntastic'.
Haaave fuuuun.
I haven't done C/C++ for years
I always have fun <3
Mmm
Remember that guy who MARRIED the character in his DS?
What was that dating sim....
lol, yes
Actually, shipiing between anyone normal and PP would be scary in the first place.
Took the body pillow to the wedding.
UNLESS you can customise char.
Now I'm savvy with it's nice...
Oh god...
And OpenGL on Java isn't too bad. lwjgl and slick2D are plenty good for using it.
I just can't get behind shipping PP with anyone because it requires a personality overhaul just to make it feasible.
Silly
Chances are the game would be point and click
and drag
Same here.
6How have you been?
Shipping Pinkiepie? I ship her with Megatron.
gingerale: If you're sticking to 2D it wouldn't be bad, no. It's just both java and JOGL are....bulky. Full 3D is deadly to framerates
Yeah, I'll pass full 3D
So, unless you support Main Char customization, it'd be kind of annoying.
No interest with going there.. I kind of hate 3D rendering.. Bad experiences back when I thought it'd be cool. <.<
*from
And how does one even go about telling PP you love her?
Throwing a party?
That wouldn't be HM at all.
You do take soem artistic license with any character, but it gets pretty wild when PP is involved.
And, how would you give the BLUE FEATHER to Rainbow?
*some
Revolver: Ahahaha that's a good point
I mean, honestly.
And serious you borrow a lot of reference from Tribly's Notes and 6 Days a Sacrifice...
Hmm, if it's harvest moon, you'd need a farm
Maybe make it one of Celestia's feathers instead
maybe you can start with the apple family xD
Awkward Harvest Moon Plothole go.
Hehehe, that's actually a reasonable question Revolver
first girl you meet is AJ
Yeah, start with the Apples.
Rainbow Dash would probably the most difficut girl to win over
I shiiip... PinkiePie <3 Megatron, AppleJack <3< RainbowDash, Trixie <3/<3< Twilight Sparkle, Lyra <> Bon-Bon, Derpy <> The Doctor
Hmm.. What else..?
*waves around a hammer* i borrowed this from dedede if i need to do any clobbering, 'cuz i hear that might be coming up soon.
Bridgekeeper, you clever rev.
gingerale: I absolutely love you now
<3
I've been shipping Derpy <> Carrot Top .
Poo. SweetieBelle is cuter
Ooh, that's a fun one too
Pretty good, woke up an.....15 minutes ago ouo lol
I'm liking this HM idea because it isn't gay.
You?
For once.
Hehehehe
Got a problem with that?:P
Not that i'm a homophobe, but gay gets annoying.
I WILL, OK?
are you a SPY?
Argh the emoticons
There's nothing wrong with Lesbians. I lesbian lesbians
Just being corkscrewy with it...
Avian: Everyone is lesbians
Tone down the lesbian stuff guys xD
4Sorry about that
Nothing is wrong with that, but SOME people here aren't gay.
I'm not a fan of shiping either. I hate ship to ship combat so much
SOME people....
Big Mac x Caramel? Lesbians!
Hey, it's a show about 5 lesbians and 1 bi girl, what do you expect?
gingerale: You're doing lesbians wrong
No it's not.
8D
(i like the term filly foolers better)
13That's okay
4Dealing with KH wiki stuff had to go to FB
Well, Im bi, so half lesbian ^_^
I"m pretty sure RD is the only real lesbian of the group
unlurking to say that gingerale made me lose my drink, thanks a lot
6What is sleep?
6Honestly got maybe like, an hour of sleep... >>;
13FB?
4Facebook
13Oh. Okay :)
13So, whatcha been doing?
Honestly, all cartoon shows have at least ONE character that is gay
You're welcome!
filly foolers.. XD I love it.
fillyfoolers = implication of pedophilia
(Filly Foolers and Colt Cuddlers, lol.)
Lexington from Gargoyles was gay
Dumbore is gay
XD
Fillydelphia = disturbing
Rooter from the Sonic Archie series is gay
it's always sunny there
:T
Literally...
>:T
I'm being corkscrewy with the series...
literally your only purpose
YOU GOT ONE HOUR
SOLVE IT
I like to think of Twilight as bicurious but other than that I don't actually lesbian ponies indiscriminately
A good chunk of cartoonist out there intend for at least one character to be homosexual, but censors continue to keep these characters quiet
Oh yeah
Has anyone read the new DuckTales, Darkwing Duck or Rescue Rangers comics?
:O
Nope sorry
Because I have all the issues so far but haven't had tiem to read them..
Here we go, Fassad....

Thank Cheddah if you ever see him. Got those from him. :B

Lol aww man o_o
Hmm..
I wonder if I could write an online reader for those comics..
How many here are MSPA fans at that?
My favorate face is the happy bird face ^v^
Wouldn't be too difficult using servlets.

I read MSPA
That's actually my facial expression when reacting to most of the stuffs that go on here.
That too
4Also it looks like Skylander is going to come out about 300$
MSPA <3
haven't caught up with Homestuck yet though
I wonder if Doctor Scratch is Cadabath's across-the-street- neighbor...
13Okay. I've never played a GameCube, so I assume it's harder on that.
^_^
only like 3/5 done
I started reading it when it was still showing Problem Sleuth. I caught up when the final boss battle started.
4What type of money do you use there?
OH GOD HOMESTUCK *hides under cash register*
Zenith: so that puts you somewhere in act 5, right?
gingerale: Same!
I think I actually just started Act 4 so my estimation was a bit off
And Rev...
Yeah Act 5 is a beast
/me rolls
06And o.o
6It's not that big of a deal.
4oh
6I pull all nighters quite frequently.
13And $300? I just hope it's an awsome game! :)
Um? no
is today "talk like Dedede in the dub of the Kirby anime" day
(he's just hiding)
i actually like 4kids dedede...
Hssss 4kids
Hah you're lucky...I couldn't pull an all nighter if I tried

that was probably their best dub... that's not saying much though...
13I'm currently on KHII, and it's not much longer 'till the battle with Sark and the MCP!
But then again
Vriska needs to hurry up and die.
Knowing him he'll probably just kill her off straight there and then
$300? O______________________________________________________o
4well thats my guess
Vriska is the second best troll though <3
ANYWAY
Because he's always straightforward >.>
*hits revolver on the head* found you!

hey folks Igotta run (gallop? or is that lame?)
13I thought you hate Kingdom Hearts
Sapphire Pussies
See ya round - bye!
I don't like it, I don't hate it.
Karet Cats
Hmm
13But do you, or don't you, want to see it?
Sure.
I guess that could work

Yawn.
/me rocks out to 'Modern Love'
ohai
Prodigy
5Anyone awake..?
Hey :o
I'm BARELY awake
yep
5xD Hi Sky.
Hey RP4L :)
gaaaaaah
5It's already 10:30 here so of course I'm awake. x3
13Please make no negitive comments about it. It took me four months to build, and it's still growing.
30 minutes of "sleep" and no caffeine after staying up for like 20 hours
I'm ready to crash after today.
13ohai RP4L :3
5O-o;
5Geez, what's the occasion, Sky?
Education.
:P
Wow
5You're not out for summer?
I just discovered the convert ink feature in OneNote
I'm in Canada
Canadians end in June
It's surprising accurate
:P
and hi guys
5Aaahh, okay, I see.
Hey eX
So while we end one month later, we do start in September :P
RP4L: I liked your Nyan Cat spoof avatar you used to have on teh forums XD
And oh?
5Oh, haha! xD Thank you~
I scribbled cursive, and it worked perfectly
5I changed it though. :X
What's your OneNote version? I'm using 2010
5Hm.. well, it wasn't /OneNote/ I used but a similar program.
Cats crossbreeding with poptarts
/me shivers
But how else do people improve other than by constructive criticism?
5LOL~ xD
Oh
I don't have anything negative to say anyway though.
Maybe they are not as good then
5Nyan nyan nyan nyan~
5Nah, probably not
And Nyan Cat <3
5but my handwriting is kind of sloppy. :P
13Those poptarts ARE pretty sexy I guess
13and delicious
13sexy and delicious
5Strawberry Poptarts aren't that great IMO.
13|D
Nyan cat Is on par with Gyro Bowl as my God.
5I prefer --
5xDD
4God theres a lack of Cynder and Angel
13It's not criticism. It's infomation and my thoughts. And that's good there is nothing negitive about it
5The Epic Sax Guy is my god.
13You saw the Legado, DSD?
13What'd you think?
5(...Primarily because I also play Alto Saxophone.)
LOL
that guy, i remember him
4It was cool
5Eeeeeeeeveryone in my section last year knew how to play that.
ah well, back to chewing bubble gum :P
5And of course as section leader I made sure they all did. (;
But this cat-tart farts out rainbows.
RAINBOWS, PEOPLE.
4Ok Uxie do you think we should get coverart for all the games
Double rainbows too, in fact
5RAINBOWS ARE AMAZING. :3
5Noooooooo
5It's just a single rainbow.
Intense double rainbows.
5Come on man.
4Meaning xbox gamcube and PS2 versions of the games
13Yes, we should
5SO INTEEEEEENSE
5>:D
5OMIGAWD, IT'S A DOUBLE RAINBOW
Epic intensity
:o
5That guy kind of freaks me out because he's freaking out over a RAINBOW.
4ok
13"I could hit that all day long... with an iron pick"
13Anyway, what are you most impressed with, DSD?
13these minecraft tutorial videos amuse me with the guy's unintentional innuendos |D
13I meant of my Legado
RP4L
5I just realized that I'm now within the top twenty for Chat Stats~ Yay!
If he love rainbows so much he might as well buy a Rainbow Dash plush and hug it all day
Now imagine that guy is Aero.
/me hides
8D
5NUUUUUUUUUUU
5NOT THE PONIES. D:
Yup
Ew
Did someone say Epic Sax Man?
5What?
Ponies.
5WHAAAAT
I got suckered into MLP:FiM
/me shakes fist at Nightmare Moon
Someone showed me that last night
5>:C
I died a little.
What?
The characters are just so...ugh
Especially Dash
If you watched the pilots then I can understand why.
He just makes me want to find a rainbow and punch it in the face.
5How dare you scar the perfect image of an Alto with the freakin' MLP character!? D:
13Ponies again
/me hides
Yeah, i think I'll turn in for now xD
No ponies.
Also, Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
13and Rainbow Dash is a girl lol
Never ponies.
5THERE IS A LINE
Cya'll later xD
5IT CANNOT BE CROSSED. :C
and Rainbow Dash is a girl lol <--- I am SCARED.
5(That line includes RUSH, the precious image of the Alto Saxophone, and of course Mewtwo.)
13I don't want ponies either :B Not from any bronies, at least
Rush.
RUSH.
RUUUUUUUUUUUUSH.
06I'll stick to brownies
What.
13Brownies <3
Some bronies are creepy, admittedly
06the title of that is rather suitable
/me throws brownies at RP4L
/me 5noms and feels slightly better from all the Pony overload.
:D
5............ :3
5Seriously?
Yet I still recognize like everyone
Yep
Fluttershy caring for the legendary birds <3
eXARK, you, Angel, Espeon
5NOT WORTHY. :C
:P
RP4L
I wanted to tell you before but
I kind of turn up intermittently for a few months then disappear.
Your story makes me want to destroy mine
So most people don't remember me.
Because I can't write it anymore
LOL
Who is not worthy?
dari, how long have you been with TST?
Or at least Chat?
5Which story, Sky? D:
RP4L: You know which one.
5Er, which story of mine. xD
I don't actually use the forum, but the first time I've been on here was probably in 2009.
4Um
Your most recent one
LOL
4The BBS part
Who were you saying was not worthy? Oo
5Oh, Cut to the Chase.
dari: Probably why I haven't seen you, I became inactive around 2009
Was active from 2006-2009
5In that picture.
Ah right.
http://i.imgur.com/txBzs.jpg <- I think that Peach is into drag racing :P
What. oo
I don't really know what to make of that picture
5Sky, so you /are/ reading it? ;w; That makes me happy~ Because I see Aurora is now updating hers a LOT and she's got soooo many views and I don't think I'm getting any new readers. xD;
RP4L
There's no shells of any colour variation here.
I was one of the people that got her back to writing it
LOL
A few days ago.
5I mean
And I updated a chapter of mine too
also, that stupid freaking horse is in the race.
5I think it's really cool she's getting back into it
Though that chapter is a tragedy
5I mean one writer to another
Your story was a surprise
I usually don't check other people'
people's fanfics*
? Horse?
You mean Yoshi? Yoshi's a dinosaur...
5Hm? Oh, well, then I'm glad you picked it up. ^^;
Are you sure?
I instantly liked yours
Randomly clicking on it on dA
:P
Though your comment was like "OMG A COMMENT FROM YOU!?"
Because he looks like a horse to me.
LOL
What's so special about a comment from me? :P
Also: WHY IS THERE A GUY DRESSED AS PEACH.
Yoshi a horse, haha, nope.
5When it comes to fanfics I'm really motivated at first but if I feel like no one reads then.. yeah..
5Oh, haha, well, you never comment on my stuff.
5Not that often anyways.
Well, Yoshi /does/ have a saddle
True. :P
But yeah it comes with the job
Yeah!
Not many people read fanfics anymore on the boards
5I have a pretty good way of keeping track (in my memory) of who comments often. I don't get nearly as much feedback as I'd like.
Not even the RP board.
What dinosaur would wear a saddle?
5(I read 'em. o-o)
Have you never played Mario games before?
5Um, if they interest me. ^^;
RoyKirbs: yoshi ofc
yes
5The "other" fanfic board not so much because I don't know any of the fandoms. >__>;;
Lmao RP4L, it's been like that in terms of comments for a long time for me.
Hence the lack of motivation to do more :P
13What's your favourite world in KHII?
5Yeah but the weird thing is that I'm getting a LOT more faves than I used to
I don't touch the "Other" board, though I do know of them.
5but a lot LESS views and comments.
Well the more you put up, the more people notice.
:P
13And I'm glad you like the BbS part, even though it's not quite finished
5df'dsaglkjlas;dgka; it's really frustrating.
4Olympus Coliseum
5Yeah I suppose, but I really only work on one fanfic at a time. xD
4Uxie did you see my Userpage on the spyro wiki yet?
4I just updated it
5And my art projects take AGES and I'm not satisfied with some of the quick work others are satisfied to put up.
13Cool!
5Even if something doesn't turn out how I like I still SLAVE over it for a week or more.
13My favourtie world is Space Paranoids!
13I also like Halloween Town and Timeless River!
4So i take it you guys don't want to be co-founders of the spyro DA group?
4DX
13I'm still part of it. I'm even going to draw all 14 Talismans for it! (Check my SW userpage)
4I know but no one wants to be co-founders
13I'm a co-founder!
4!
5....I effectively killed the chat.
5Yay me. :|
06~
4Nice
13I'm currently working on the Glimmer Talisman: Magic Pick. Should be done by Saturday
4Nice
4BRB i'm gonig to go get a Gnorc archer out of AHT
5Oh hey it's not dead~
06not quite
4Also is it just me or is Aura using the images i get?
I could share a YouTube video right now
4I mean it's ok i guess but it ties us in more
But I'm sure it will drive everyone here nuts
It drove me nuts as well
4sorta like the kh wiki and the khwikia
It involves Pokémon Black and White.
And Pinkie Pie.
/me RUNS
13I'm doing it by order of world visit. I'm also going to draw some orbs
13Okay!
13Hm?
>_>
cause he put me on ignore >_>
4DAri is Spyro ever here?
OK it's finally dead
:P
!space
/me is disappoint in this chatroom
:P
I AM BACK!
And I AM ANGRY!
5IT'S NOT DEAD.
13Accoring to Spyro's Whois, he was here two days ago

/me coughs blood, then dies
5DDDDDDDD8
5Well that didn't work so hot.
/me points and laughs
why are you angry mr. fireant?
13SS, learn to tolerate things
13:3
Yeah, he's on quite often.
You've just got to highlight him when he's on.
Suddenly quietness.
Because of Nun.
5Yeah, I learned to tolerate Lucario fanboy---
5 /SHOT
13Problem: I work most of the time.
nun?
Or learn to use /ignore. :P
6Oh, I'm just lurking.
13pff
13ignore lol
inb4 nun of your business
FUNNY, I KNOW HOW TO DO cpr
13ignore is for silly people
nedroid
Ah oki
stupid caps
13:3
5Ignore is for people who can't handle other people. (;
Inviza, did you add more questions last night?
/me goes chewing bubble gum again, again
But that's exactly the situation here, he can't handle ponies. :P
nah i went to bed, then i had to do work today :(
fail i know :P
/me whips Inviza* ADD MORE QUESTIONS.
lol you tried that before Fireant
/me obeys.
my feet smell weird...
13But you know, it would be nice to spend a day in chat without a pony conversation for a change~
13I literally can't do a day without hearing about them these days xD
13*go
I mainly post MLP stuff when no one else is talking though, and when I stop, no one's saying anything anyway, they only talk to say "Ew ponies", then go away.
xD
You said something COMPLETELY different in AD, SHaico
Juz saiyan.
06See, I find it silly how people go ew and all

So, what's new in Equestria?
13purple cat o3o
Nuffin.
BUT MUFFIN!
*bad pun...*
I heard muffin, what.
Oh, hello Fireant!
06quite
4Who wants to see a real Espeon?
Discuss.
Sure, random topic change.
RANDOM.
06because we haven't seen that :P. And it's cute but certainly not feline enough
/me dies

You imply that mentals can't be hot?
13what do
Ponies are Great.
XD
5It needs to be somewhere between fox-like and feline, maybe...
Paragraphs Genocide.
4Yep
Anyway, good day to you colts. :)
06:3
4Say hai to flooffox
06And AE, leave it I guess? x3

Nope.
Apparently?
/me 4needs some gold and glory
They mostly tell each other how good their fics are.
xD
Also, Kenguru^ , chill, Imma just messing around.
Have you looked at the topic ever?
4Angel Espeon is officially Dorothy
No
and Fireant you havent been on when sagebrush is on a roll
/me 4drops the hammer
13*Dory
13xD
... or for that matter when I'm spamming comments in someone's gdoc
Meh, nothing going on in the RP. :|
13I'm not a feesh D:
Well I don't read fanfics but I seriously need critique on drawing poni
Freaking PonyFics Connesieurs.
Drawings?
I can critique drawings.
Oh, you draw pony too?
SPAM THEM HERE.
She's a floooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooofy espeon :3 o3o
I DEMAND IT NAOW.
Fireant does not draw pony.
I can assure you that.
/me smash the table*

capt_slowpoke, actually, quite good!
wow
i did em on paper u kno, but i has no scanner, so all i can do is take pictures of em
that's pretty damn good
Oh, cool!
I was ready to invoke my wratch, but hell, nice roman legionnaire pony
Yeah it took me forever to get it looking right.
4I would love a GIF where there is an endless Espeon picture
I absolutely love the colors you chose
4LOOPING AROUND AND AROUND
*wrath. Not Wratch...
:P
06what is that even supposed to mean
13UxieLover1994 returns
lol fireant you mispelled wraith
now pony is legion :P
06Rrrr~
Emulating the style is super hard for me to do for some reason. Which is weird because it's so simple.
wait
Okay um... this is just a rough sketch for someone else's OC. Its also a webcam picture... >_>'
http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a344/chaisu/snapshot-3.png
13That did not come out right
Yeah I have been playing too much New Vegas.
wraith... wrath... wriath..
capt_slowpoke, however I believe legs are a little to short.
That is very possible
I like it, ColorSpectrum
Oh, thank you!
4Cats
ColorSpectrum, not bad too. Proportions are ok, nice head, nice eyes, nice clothes, good.
Yay!
Anime style eyes are not what i like
my opinion though
:P
but it's still pretty good
^w^
SO
its espeons hooh54 get it right
Nob bad guys.
I'm open for comissions right now...
:B
1000x times better than Ossala!
you did awesome with the body
Lol indeed
Am I being cruel?
4http://www.forfunonly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/whoa1.gif
the hind legs look... fat though
Sorta
I am okay with the hind legs.
to ossala at least
4A bit like that animation
on mine?
Fatter than normal, but for me its ok.
Ponies tend to have stronger built hind legs anyway.
Hahaha Fireant
so Iamokwiththat.png
Poor Ossala
4Except with Espeon in an Espeon gem in an Espeon gem in an Espeon gem
06Loopspeon
Oh, heheh... I drew this from memory...
NOT BAD.
THat's all :p
Fireant: nvm; i googled the term and apparantly it stands for parental guidance
Hi Cog
I really need to start using reference...
Its still not Egophiliac or Railgunner level
CogWeaver!
CockWeaver!
I would love to see it colored
sup bronies
OH JESUS< Sorry!
CogWeaver, hello.
*facepalm*
........
04nice

SHUSH
You don't wanna know.
PG ROOM!
YOU DON'T
very carefully
ABORT!
ABOOOORT!
No moar cocktalk.
I'm gonna color him soon. 83
I never paid much attention to the rating systems since my mother let me buy&watch M rated films since I was a little filly
wait...what if they were saying "cock" as in a chicken?
Hooh54
bah this made me wanna draw
>_>
Rooster would suffice.
You just fried my mind with that GIF
better hook up my tablet :l
anyway night
so....a rooster weaver?
inb4 scootaloo
Wacom?
TABLET.
4I fried mine too, and night
CogWeaver: nice saving throw but I think it's a bit late for that
Cockerel
dang...
13before I read the word "gem" in there I thought you were refering to something completely different
oh well
bamboo, havent bothered upgrading yet
XD
Do it Jam
Its like...
Going to Equestria.
Like Heaven.
06what
Intuos all the freakin' way.
4^ This
06oh
06took me a moment
13slowspeon

13Lol that picture's from suta-raito
My intuos mouse is dying
4Espeon as drawn by insane people
Finish it.
13haven't lurked that site in ages |D
And end its misery.
4XD
4Purple eyes, white belly...
XD
4it's /me returns
4for
/me 4returns
06there's no gem this can't be an Espeon
/me is ruthless?
4It's a Freakspeon
Discuss.
4theres also /nick nickname here
13And the artist of that picture is not insane at all~ that just happens to be one of her really old pictures
I am going to end up taking it apart when it quits working.
4so /nick DSD comes out
By the way, how many of you are mares?
wait computer mouse, or mouse mouse?
noe
I will find a command that will kick all chat users that didn't speak for more than one hour.
-raises a hoof-
none
it's really aggravating when I'm playing NV or something and the button clicks but nothing happens.
Fireant: NO.
I'll say one thing an hour then/
Why not?
tell me about it Fireant. there are 58 people in this chat, and only a handful are speaking
no mares on the internet!
4I know XD
Ossala was a filly.
But... I'm a mare...
Because lurking is a key part of irc
Ossala is a filly.
But she left, crushed by my honesty.
what, you seen proof?
And a filly is just a little baby, not a female.
damn strait
^
Her DA says she's a male tho.
no one can prove that they're a mare
what ColorSpectrum said
WHUT?
and no one can prove that they're a colt
only pics can do it
and timestamp
/me is dissapoint.
not in a PG chat they can't.
Filly is a female horse, too young to be called a mare.
I'm a mare... ;_;
Who to trust here?
The voice of reason in here is now
Shaico
You mean
Shaico, Lololololo.
Who to
then what's a foal?
13Okay!
/me puts on sunglasses*
Listen to me, for my word is truth.
THRUST?
AH.
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i invoke rule 30 and 31
Okay, fillies and foals.
Fillyfoolery.
why did that make me lol
THE RULES OF THE INTERNET SHALL NOT BE STATED HERE.
D8

TRIXIE IS AWESOME

She's a PERFORMER.
Trixie is boring and simple.
Lyra is better

Do you expect her to be all modest?
[12:51:25] (oh yeah, and now i'm hornier than a rabbit in mating season *rimshot*)
Trixie is annoying...but she is pretty good-looking

SHaico Speaks Truth.
XD
Now tell us about Lyra again, Shaico
But nopony can match the awesomeness of Applejack
Lyra is so much better than Lyra.

For college too.
i mean the relevant ones that get featured in such places as wired
i mean 32y-old?
ah yes, they are a bit old for college, i think?
what's wrong with a 32 year old brony
maybe they are getting their PHDs
not like they could pick when they were born in relation to the release of MLP:FiM
well shit
that they dont go to school anymore...
that's an assumption though
or maybe...
there's a guy I know at college
eep!
who's like 45
completing a master's
He's from Ecuador though
yea, its now popular to go back to college for your education apparently
*too much peer pressure*

college is much better than high school though IMO
my perception of the world is ashaming orz

old school or e3 2011?
i dont care.

Silly people, we all know that Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
Silly ponies, that's not how you spell Twilight
Twilight is a horrible book and should be ashamed of herself
CogWeaver couldn't handle the truth.
not refering to THAT Twilight
6I dislike when my watched threads tell me there's a new post... and it turns out to be mine.
You guys are helpful. :P
THEY'RE SPELLED THE SAME WAY
I wonder if this idea could be applied to ponies http://pics.kuvaton.com/kuvei/cute_ring.jpg
8lol
8that happens to me so much
I would but I'm an idiot so...
this is pony chat, thus i'm refering to pony Twilght
All you have to do is tell me what the quality looks like, and how much it lags.

8one of my IRL friends just posted an article on facebook from the washington post arguing that we should bring back public floggings instead of prison
You asked a question and I attempted to provide an answer for it.
8wtf?
your attempt was not good enough
My attempt was excellent. I can only attrite your misunderstanding to human error.
I am confuse
And my lack of letters in "attribute" to Bluetooth connection errors.
larscis is a ROBOT
6...wtf indeed.
...
:3

Silly movie
XD
"human" error?

4Hi :3
sounds good to me
Viral scandals and faceprints abound.
Ok, thanks.
I've got some srs bsns with my internets.
?
because the internet is so serious! Gosh!
So yes
Oh hi, Cog.
YES
All the fun people in the world come from Finland.
8i have an extremely rigid sleep schedule
You get the plot explained to you yet?
8i never stay up past 11:30 on weeknights
yummy plot
a bit...
...
8and i always wake up by 8, if not earlier
8during the summer anyway
we need more plot
My internet died, and my Dad came over here to check it out, and it started working again.
I'm taking a break from the RP for a little while here, Rev. I'll get back to it soon, though don't worry
Still.
I don't want to explain MORE plot to you.
then just do the RP without me
Taking a break is fine, but the explanations just keep piling up...
it was pretty over my head for the most part anyways
Revolver: how long ago?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEbFXzZiuG8&NR=1
And plus it would be nice to have you for what's coming up.
Forget explanations I can just send him chatlogs if it was in eqdrp Revolver
its not
o
boo

Nope.
It's in Downstairs_Room.

8lol
5I really don't see what the appeal is. D:
^
Minecraft is kind of boring.
Its addicting
13I didn't either until I started watching this tutorial series xD
There's nothing to do.
for once i agree with dari
But its best to play on a server
:P
Derpy!
That's fuuny

...
*sigh*
yea i didnt really kno wat to put lol
13I already know I'm gonna be constantly paranoid about creepers

Like everyyyyyything in life lol
but its coming along micely
Except Animal Crossing is BETER
BETTER*
5Nuh uh. :|
Your preference
13Why, because it's Nintendo? :P
No.
cool
Hi Fireant
pretty much anything is better than Minecraft
*cough* even ponies*cough*
Anyways, I need to talk to articuno about the tst minecraft server, which we still haven't gotten running
5Games with plots > Games without them. xD
hey what's up
And glad you think so ss
Hey
nothing
13Meh, your opinion, just don't state things like it's a fact :3
Nothing, I'm writing a song
That
But anyways
so NPR wants to do an interview with me about Bronies and why I like the show should I do it
5Isn't everything anyone says automatically attached with "imo", then?
Yeh
I have a tendency to do that so excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me
:P
5Except for like math equations?
Sure.
it's for the show Wait Wait Dont'e Tell Me
I would.
13I only say IMO when I'm stating something that's disagreeing with the person I'm talking to xD
*Don't
Lol
meh then I guess I'll do it.
8well, my get to know oat thread has derailed into a music discussion
Sweet.
8i blame justin bieber
Hey ProminenceFlare
waits whos gunna interview u
Ah, hello.
13but yes, respect my opinions and I'll respect yours :3
Guy, guys.
I got a question.
Who has an answer?
Yeah hopefully I'll be able to give a good impression about the fandom that the wired article wasn't so great about
User_7366: I have a BANHAMMOR does that count?
nope.avi
6I could derail it again.
:<
:D
5...And if people lived by that code we wouldn't have war. /sigh
:p
This woman named Eva is going to do a phone chat and I'll give my opinion about why I like the show
Depends on the question.
6But then it would be about classy ponies.
i like war
/me flees
We're fucked
jk
?
I tried asking this Study, zekes probably saw it
BronyVids: remember to talk in a sane fashion
If Anna Wintor is Photo Finish
And Karl Lagerfield (?) is Hoity Toity

Who is Shakespeare?
13Now brb, I need to eat something
Uuuuummmmm...
6I want popcorn. o.o
No idea.
BAWWWWWW!
I will try to talk as sanelu as possible
sanely*
Hey Mongoose
hey
All I have so far is Play Wright. Seems kinda amiguous, though.
Mongoose!
8its gonna be damn hard to derail it at this point
ambiguous*
plus I don't have aspergers so that should help
Sup Mongoose
Yeah true
8thats not a challenge, btw
Hey all
6...
6Un-challenge accepted.
6Now I just need to find the thread.
DERPY!
6Challenge accepted.
:DD
Nice
womp womp
wow
k
*wah wah wah wah waaaaah*
total fail?
but its derpy lol
hey hey hey, is someone bashing Aspergers
I don't think so, Ali
stupid wrong pasword
hows everypony this fine afternoon?
Now I know how scootaloo feels when she bashed her head against the piano.
Science.
no one is bashing it I'm just saying it can make people have the wrong idea about Bronies thinking we are only how the Wired interview portrayed it.
Scootaloo's head is a piano.
And when he gets angry, it plays a demo.
6Hmm... may be harder than anticipated, after actually looking at the thread.
13Back with a sandwich :B
huh?
i bet u they`ll manipulate it -_-
ok, just making sure *goes back to lurking*
13because, as always, there's nothing better to eat and sandwiches are the only thing I can make |D
Insanity and georgia-style flapjacks.
Roy said that Scootaloo's head is a piano McDuck.
something about sweet cuppin' cakes?
I sometimes think I have the same mentality of Pinkie Pie and Derpy Hooves combined.
/me 5is distracted by Rush interview videos. >__>;;
That would be scary Roy
not a good combo
lol
6WTF DIFFERENT OC
I hope not!
I want to scare as many people as I can!
I'm making pasta
It's a game I made up.

it's just me gabe newell
03and we're replacing them all with DVDs XD
Meh, Trixie. I'm not intimidated.
8whoa, what happened with amonisis?
*dissappears*
5My VHS is broken. :C
3.5
03I have like 4 VCRs
5Well, it won't hook up to the sound system anymore. :|
kinda pointless to spend money for something you already have :p
I love VHA ;P
Don't mind Lightning, though. He's a custom class based on speed.
*VHS
5It just flat out doesn't function.
that was just me getting myself over to somewhere
Vhs tapes are horrible quality though lol
aaaah well that makes a little more sense, i have more expertise at 4th
03yeah

03not really
And they fizz out after enough plays

Hmm
I know; I was just being the Smug LQH

Honestly I don't get some people, wouldn't you think that Cupcakes references improve the quality of erotic pony roleplay?
:|
@_@

Nope.
8me either
erotic pony roleplay?
Not in any single way, MPR.
Not in any. single. way.
8thats why im confused

lol Derpy I'm british as well XD and i do like tea and crumpets
comedy*
and shows
Alright, go ahead and look at my guidelines and examples, and feel free to give me criticism.
Yep im british!
And i am quite partial to a spot of tea and crumpets!
...
*hits self*
6I derailed it. With classy ponies. Like I said I would.
nooo derpy..
My head hurts
I don't even know what a crumpet is
Alright, link's open.
I assume it's a trumpet made of bread and cookies
I never bothered to look it up
....
Here's link again: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJoBTIs2NRZM_4kSRVAN2VqZQzwIGTPqKTfyK_CqZFs/edit?hl=en_US
I don't know either, but I do know a "biscuit" is the equivalent of a cookie
hate to tell you LQ but its not
8it kind of derailed to The Room on its own
yup it isnt
i do know that too cog
what area you from derpy? East Anglia myself
Hey look, Predators is on.
mmm
yum
Try now, Jacob. I opened up the link for everyone to view.
6It did quite quickly.
i would say a crumpet is like a burnt cookie with extra sugar
6But The Room is not hard to derail to.
still not open
6Classy ponies is kind of just what I always derail to.
Oh Coz im in the East Anglia Area!
Jacob_tech thats no crumpet I've ever eaten
6I repeat. You are not fluterolling me.
6Not even in the selection thread.
alright i got it LQ i had to sign out
8that was intended for other people
Coz its ALOT like the ones i had in london last year
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
02.-.
pretty cool LQ
Thanks.
6...what's the deal on bronyshow.com?
6I can't see it, it's blocked.
what about the various Pegasi?
I don't really have any Pegasus-like or Alicorn-like characters.
...
A friend has a dragon, though.
This hp veer phone
8dunno, isnt blocked for me
Is it really that small o.o;
6I have sonicwall blocking it.
6Cafe wifi, remember?
6I meant what's the site like?
I was thinking of making LQ a pegasus, but that would be too powerful, and he's really my only athletic character.
no im saying how would the ingame rules classify and make it so pegasi arent OP?
Hmm... Good question.
I haven't really thought about that.
8what site, bronyshow?
so who agrees that pic of the young Cheerilee with Rick Astley (the one at the top of the EqD page) is the most adorable pic ever?
like yould pegasi have a constant "Levatate" on them that just acts as a minor action activate?
I'd think so, yeah. That's a great idea.
6Yeah.
i helped my freind make his version of GURPS... i kinda have a background in making roleplay systems lol
Now the question remains: Should I take away Glimmermane's Ring of Levitation?
he calls it DERP Deeply Engaging Roll Playing
8just a normal blog
8pretty much
win
lol
That's a boss name for an RP style.
role* btw rite or is it roll? thats is ^
It's role.
no its ROLL as in the roll of the dice determines action
I can imagine a "Roll Playing Game"...
6:3
no, it's role as in "you play the ROLE of a character"
ok cuz i was thinking cuz of the dice also
lol
roll playing game is a pun
"I'm a d6!"
FEED MEH
ya^
it makes fun of players who only mixmax their characters
lol
and don't focus on story, interactions etc
sorry cog but the roll of dice dictates your carachters action not you
poor D12...so misaligned...so unused...
But you're playing a role.
no the roll of dice determines success or failure
all natural glue
Even the D1 gets more play, and it doesn't even exist!
you kidding fighters use d12 alll the time
HEY
so
Seth is here!
Hey ther--
*salutes Seth*
So?
try 2d6
Seth!
Ones with Greataxes do.
>greataxe
NPR Emails you and says "Give me a 20 second response about why you like My Little Pony!"
wwww
What do yuo say?
Barbarians use d12s.
Because Twilight and Fluttershy are hhhhhnnnnnnnggggggggggg
PsychicKid nice
afterdark's nice
Art style is great, the characters are varied and well-developed,
Hi Sethisto
yo!
and what fooby said
also hey LQ i didnt see a ring in your sheet
becuase my master wizard told me to watch and i did as he asked
i.e. more adult themes, makes it more relateable/enjoyable
Ah. That's because it's under his "Notable Tricks"
-e
okay guys, the crumpet debate is settled
I think I had an extra e in there
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crumpet&oldid=434639951
Under "Levitation"
read that and bow before my correctness
*continues rolling ball*
Added details for them
O.o
i see it now i watched you edit it :P
Lawl
there was a debate on crumpets?
So, pixar style hidden adult humor?
that's a good ay
Well not all of it is hidden. And not all of it is adult.
pixar-style humor
/me 6throws a cookie to Icy.
Don't. Say. Adult.
Though the new banner reminded me of the Soapbox gag.
That was funny.
I'm just leaving out the abilities most MLP unicorns get.
yah
O thx :3
Such as telekinesis
What could be used in place of Adult?
ok so gonna break off from chat and read some flutterdash shipping... there really needs to be a seachbar for it :P
pixar-style humor works fine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g81bR8gWzTE&feature=related
03well bbl, tutoring
and LQ it looks good, im just a bit worried how combat would play out because a horse in D&D can only do 1d6 damage or a warhorse 1D8
oh lol I didn't even edit that under proxy
whooops
i got a proxy, just didn't actually use it
there go any editing privileges
just one? i got like 7
So... 20 seconds? They're asking you in an email to give them a sound bite?
Over the phone
Eh, MLP ponies tend to carry things in their mouths and saddlebags.
awesome dude! maybe it will be featured in a commercial
9001 days a saiyan
They can use weapons.
<Sethisto> NPR Emails you
YOU TRICKED ME D:
pft
@_@ just thought of a Roranoa Zoro MLP character, but ALL 3 BLADES IN THE MOUTH!!!
flutterdash time now
I'd say that I love the animation, the depths of character personality, and the dialogue.
So, pixar reference
huge plus
I'm including that for sure
Hmmm?
wait, Seth, did that actually happen to you?
Oh.
Music.
8what time do you think you're gonna start pre-show tomorrow?
Particular songs based off of broadway hits.
guys. did anyone else see the drama on ponychan?
happening at least
Also, I'm assuming I'm the only one that sees my text in green?
At least on this end.
Except reword it so it sounds better.
What Ponychan drama? O_O
theres always ponychan drama
the one about the scammer
I don't know; can you see this?
Ponychan drama
You mean the radio station bs?
nope
What happened now w
*lol
some guy from /co/ asked for donations
Goddamnit I gotta stop hanging around 2ch. I keep using w instead of lol
6I'll probably get here 2-2:30
oboyherewego.jpg
some ponychanners gave money
Linker, can you see this text in green?
Lemme guess, it was a scam
it was found out that it was a scam
No.
yup
and basically a bunch of threads popped up
Well, at least I can pick out my own messages this way.
5Oh my. I just got a hundred bucks grad money from my aunt and uncle.
Huh.
5.....SCORE! 8D
Well people shouldn't fall so easily for that
I don't know why it's set like this, then.
What were the donations for
and amonisis (one of the "popular" users) decided to "test" ponychan
and made a donation thread as an anon
No more typing 'rainbow dash' with seven different colors. :'(
Ikr
basically super drama now
I never donate money because I don't have a job
8okay, thats about when im getting back from work, so thats perfect
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/arch/res/2497750.html
Does this work?
I'll read it later
8do you have any stuff you're planning on showing?
Lol
My brain is numb from a nap; I won't be able to process the drama
i skimmed the first half then ctrl+fed amonisis
6For the preshow. Just a couple things. The usual vids that are almost always shown.
6HAVE to play Aladdin Commits Suicide.
it's tiring hearing the same few arguments over and over again
i read that as like
ctrl+FED
As in "the feds"
lmao
4Ohai
like an FBI command to search out crminals
Fucking beastly w
5Ohey
4I have come
yuppers
there's that w again
6I'm actually on youtube now looking about for things.
there we go
'M gettin' a job soon, but I think a chunk's set aside for a shiny 3DS.
I'm getting a job after I graduate
i've always wanted to try the 3ds
I can't handle both school and a job at the same time
Wasn't interested at all until I saw gameplay of OoT-3D.
Oh my god it looks good.
Lies
8you should totally show an episode of Kenan and Kel
i wanna experience it myself first before i decide
School is so draining
ikr
At least ponies are helping push me through it :D
stupid exams now
I'm taking summer courses now
Feels bad man
But, one is weather, and weather is interesting
thank god i don't have to take summerschool
The other is like music 103 or something silly
And my waifu is a singer so it's ok
lol
I don't HAVE to take it
But if I don't, at least one of my semesters will be super packed
GAH i should really be studying for functions right now
6...if I can find one.
6I should look for that.
I should be mowing the lawn right now.
>_>
Knocking two courses out will let me re-distribute my last 3 semesters so the last one is only like, 3 courses
<_<
5NOTHING IS REAL
5D:
cuz I already gotta go an extra semester because of my minor
i'm pretty sure we're all supposed to be doing something right now
6YOUTUBE Y U BUFFER?
Actually
I literally have nothing to do for the next 16 hours
wow
Except register some small thing for my music class
that's quite fortunate
4Nuuuu'
I'm just that amazing
Which you'll put off for 15 hours.
:P
^
Yes
8ill look it up
I do that :D
4Youtube hates me right now
Although I should probably read the first chapter for the music class
It hates everyone
Music theory goes over my head
Why do I have the sudden idea...
4none of the videos work D :
4I just get a black square
That someone should parody a Red Bull commercial with ponies?
it's already been done
8heres a good one: http://megavideo.com/?v=P6OINJH5
5I hate how so many of my favourite YT videos have been deleted
Red Colt gives you wings?
Is flash player outdated?
I didn't know that.
5by the stupid copyrighting people. :|
Yeah :(
wait
Rarity: Red Bull gives you WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGS
actually no it hasn't
Twilight: ...No, I did that.
Yeah copyrights are crap
I copy right this
4True
whoops
I copyright that
Well
5I mean the uploader BOUGHT it and it's not like they're making PROFIT off of putting it on Youtube, sheesh.
4I miss some old videos too
that wasn't ponies i was thinking of
6>:(
5It's all like.. community service. xD
Sharing
5Yeah!
Is daring, not care
*Caring
5And I love it when people share. <3
6>=(
Oh god no
But yeah, copytube is evil
6WHY CAN I NOT SEE MEGAVIDEO?
/me yaaaaaaawns
wow i'm retarded
What I dont like is the removal of amvs
5Then the big bad fortune 500 company gets all butthurt and storms in to delete all the good videos. :C
5YES
5FFFFFFFFF
4YES
Its one thing to take down the videos of the actual movie
5That's just stupid!
But amvs....that's ridiculous
5Omigosh or if they MUTE the video.
4I hate when they take down movies
5Because the song is copyrighted or whatever. :|
4And they want you to go to some stupid poll site
14Oh yes.
Don't ask why I changed ponies.
I just
Actually.
Wanna wrap Fluttershy up in a blankey and squeeze her closely so she feels warm and safe
12I'm kidding, come here and get your hug.
83
Gtg, dance class..be back in an hour or so c:
kyaaa doushio
Someone needs to remix "Cookin' by the Book"
With ponies.
14._. I like my distance thanks
:D
4Well that's stupid
5UGH I hate those poll sites. xDD
Problem really?
;p
5HML YES I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
Again, I understand when the video itself is removed
12.... pwease... I good boi
5(Because it's my fave movie~)
Oh, gawd. At least it isn't "You are a pirate"
/me 14briefly hugs icy then runs back
I don't see any reason for there to be one for "You are a Pirate", as it's probably already done.
dunno...for things like the story of young mewtwo
Which is near impossible to find
12:3 dat wasn't so bad
Those should be allowed up
Scratch that; there's no reason for it to even exist.
5I mean they put NEW SHOWS up for streaming all the time and yet a 13-year-old movie is more of a concern!?
depends on the company
You realize that pokemon movies are taken down not because of youtube, but because of shogakuken
How sad, I killed someone just by entering...
14Aw I thought C7 would be active :X
There's no reasons for someone to put Ponies to Starcraft 2, either.
5Mmm, yeah, I know.
5YT I have no issue with. xD
*reason
12She's just doing her own thing
Some companies are ok with stuff though, which is why mlp is completely on yt lol
Ahh, Ponycraft.
8bye chobi
8is it blocked?
14D:
hi
06Well considering they can thank an audience outside their actual target audience for their success that's not too weird if you ask me :P
/me flops
12She'll be back
Can anyone give me some advice on my 4 pony characters? --> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJoBTIs2NRZM_4kSRVAN2VqZQzwIGTPqKTfyK_CqZFs/edit?hl=en_US
Lol
Well there's that
!Espeon
I first got into this when I saw the scene in there of Twilight casting a spell so intense she was wearing holes in the ground with her feet, and thought, 'This is not a normal little girl's cartoon'.
5And the entire Star Trek TOS series is on YT. ALL OF IT. EVERY EPISODE.
I hate it the most when they take off OSTs :P
Twilight is love.
/me eeps
5I tell ya that's a lot more popular and in demand than some obscure Jap' version a Pokeymanz movie.
Because she is purple.
14Hopefully.
I can relate to that statement.
Purple is the best color
Only because it's made up of red and blue, the best colors
I agree with that too. But Pinkie Pie is the best. ^_^
I chose purple as a compromise :D
XD
5Actually, I think Shopro is sometimes the issue... "This video contains content from Shopro, who has blocked it on copyright grounds."
12Anyways, how are doing?
6No, it just doesn't display like, anything.
14I'm fine. How about you?
Dunno, I remember all my videos going down cuz of shogakuken
5Like on a part of Shiro1987's vid part, "Myuutsu! Ware wa Koko ni Ari part 5"
Pinkie pie is no doubt the best pony for PMVing
14Still doing your....thing?
4Yeah
but TS can't be dethroned in my list

4The one problem I have
*kowtow*
*squeals*
4Zazu :3
everyone bow
PONIES SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH
4Is why did Amonisis' apology get archived?
12I've heard it was good but, idk
6It's the only other game I have in mind other than MW2..
6:O
hi sethisto
6It did?
Aw, Chickenwingz16 died...
Can luna come out and play princess?
6Dear lord... >>;
OPEN UP THE CONVERSION BUREAUS! XD
4Yeah, it got archived
Oh look its seth

4I actually got Amo's attention however, that was neat
6YEAH! I knew it had JB in the intro! :D

Seth is busy writing

Bubblegum. >_>
and also like lord of the rings
Seth, get ur flank over here and be told hi by the princess!!
no i am princess_Celestia
8i still dont know what he did, but dont tell me
4Alright
yeah
/me is the lord of the pings
/me bows.
Quit the act, Bubblegum.
4You're really pushing for /chat/ and /oat/ to be merged, aren't you
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ivYd2NDRvc
hellow fireant
lord of the rings
hello*
6Wtf. o.o
This is going to sound really filly-ish, but how do you do those actions? Is it just /me?
yay fireant's in the house!
yes
6AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS! FY! :D
8i am
4LORD OF THE PENGUINS
/me does this
You put '/me' before you say anything
4why?
/me /me like this
Alright.
LORD OF TEH FLIIIIIIIEEEEEEESSS
8because it makes sense
Muthafudger!
8the current division creates so many problems
*shot and beaten
14brb a sec
8actually, no, i dont want them to be merged, i want them to be changed
4?
4We're all mothers of fudge!
Boohoooo, we're on the last episode. Augh I need season 2 before I go insane x infinity. >.<
4Delicious
you know the evil eye of suron
8so /oat/ would be "general randomness" and /chat/ would be "serious non-pony discussion"
hmm
Join the club.
how do you use mibbit to get here?
your tyrant celestia demands a interveiw with fireant
a friend can't use the ED client
/me rolls in the grass
4Isn't that what it's like now?
4I rarely see any pony threads over in /chat/
welcome
it's not on the list of servers
Oh, I have. I just keep going more insane every time I finish it...
I am using mibbit
have you watch it?
welcome
MPR: connect to this server from any IRC client using irc.lightirc.com
you need to type the lightirc link in a box below
/me rolls in the grass again
I'm just using the page's built-in client.
IIRC
well
this princess is out of here
zeke: mibbit, though? <_<
same im gunna go chill
cya then
bye
6That's pretty much what it is now.
._.
D:
6...and that's because /chat/ is non-pony randomness...
The room is dark without the Princess...
yep
Maybe that means Luna is near! Ooh
/me luna!!!!
6...and /oat/ is supposed to be pony-related nonsense.
4Hmm
4Well, I see what you mean
Don't worry, I'll get Fire to come out here and makes some light *buhdumtsh!*
4But I thought chat wasn't meant to be serious? I thought it was just a chill place to post
12yes
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, gala song!
Ohai.
6It is.
Yo.
6It's not supposed to be serious at all.
O hai Unidentified1980
6It just ended up being that way.
hi
Hello.

Howdy doody...

now that i think back, derpy didnt get sick with the baked bads!!!
XD
StylusPick there was Elements of Discord though that was more Sauron-like
4For a second I thought you said Rolling in the Derp
Either that, or derpy became derpy from the baked bads.
I see. and what about a story involving Zalgo ponies? I haven't noticed any
I am unfamiliar with zalgo ponies
no man, she was alrady derpying it since ep 1
Luna Games 1, 2 and 3.
Didn't play any of those
there was a sweet little fic where derpy was derp-eyed because of poison oak
Comic you mean?
zecora kept giving her the cure, but those flowers were just too tasty for her XD
4Well, unfortunately, oat receives far more traffic than any board. And you can't exactly tell people to stop posting on oat

4Oh, I have Dialga with me

4I'll switch out for Nintales
So it's part of my childhood
@NAFEDUDE May I see it?

7Okay. I'll wait. :P
I adore the show to pieces
I want to crossover them with ponies
7And Dialga, lol.

8alright, see ya later
</shameless plug>
heh I used to watch powerpuff girls and fosters home for imaginary friends when I was a kid
It's 216 episodes though
7They're OP. :U
Actually nafe that might not be a good idea
7Well, the main ones.
This is a PG chat
And we've still got like 50 episodes to go
im stell remabering my past of lord of the rings
7The total base 580 ones and some 600 ones aren't.
But really, it's similar to Ponies
so when I heard this was by Faust I thought "YES, THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS SHOW"
8FUCK YOU KID YOU'RE A DICK
And I was Like Oatmeal Are You Crazy?!
It tosses realistic situations at the characters
Wurk tiem, later ponies
Without being "preachy" about morals
y'know
xcept they fight the forces of evil more often
:P
I should really get my team together so I can start battling people
Adios
Doremi has no evil fighting
Well
Fooby
my line, being stolen
*sadface*
It.... kiiiiiiiiiiiiinda does a liiiiiiiiiiiiil bit at certain episodes
7Do so? :P
Anyone play minecraft?
It's less evil fighting and more "Stop the magical pedo wizard from kidnapping the doom baby"
*burrows again*
7Unless you've got something else that you have to do.
>.> anyone

And that's an impolite question to ask online
yes
I really liked the meta-games The End plays.
I rewatched those scenes over and over.
Seriously I walked down that river forever. I should not have killed that many people.
Without cringing once.
*why
The End was my favorite.
srsly geez
The scariest games you will ever play were the ones when you were 12 years old......Ahh i remember how much the zombie level on timesplitters 3 freaked me out
6wb
8...gross
i wonder if anypony could get to the sorrow without having killed none
*peers at user list* Sheeeoot, that's a lotta bronies.
i dont want to play it against because it will ruin it for me
12ok
4hi

5Some people would rather keep their age anonymous. That's their choice. =/
7Huh. Didn't know you could only choose 3 pokemon with Flat Rules on. O_o
I kinda miss the Persona games...
I remeber resident evil 2 freaked the hell out of me
