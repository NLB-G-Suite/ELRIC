4Sweden

4Brb, lunch
4They have free health care in Sweeden
4Yeah
8but i do feel bad for the people that got suckered in
4He got money from us
4This is easily the most despicable thing I've seen /co/ do in a long time
8its also a felony
8i hope he goes to jail
4Agreed
1pm Hooh?
8im sure the mods reported his IP
4I'm sure others reported his email as well
4We have his alias apparently
8dont raid
8looked up the u.s. code
8he would be guilty of wire fraud, which has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison
8i reported my post to make sure the mods see it too
4I'm finally in /co/, lurking to see if the douche is gloating
03*WB02(Aeroslash02)03WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D

4Bleh
8you dont like Soldier?
4No

4Nope
8hes one of my favorite posters
4He's the biggest attention horse on the site

hey guys
4Seriously, people are gonna tolerate this
8thats ok
7cool
8also, did you catch the drama on /oat/?
7The dontation thread that was a scam or something?
8yeah
7I saw the thread, but didnt read it
4I don't think he'd stoop to the cockstain level that Faceless did
4Much
4Yeah, he figured it out
o.o
8cool beans
And terrible
Floof gone wrong
4About the pre-show and post-show
4And also about where to get the movies
8ok

4That scam thread is my evidence
4But despite all that, I realize that Ponychan is the more mature site because we haven't stooped to 4chan's level yet
4Santaburd
10I misread that for Satanburd
4Fear me, I'm the devilburd
/me shows no sign of fear
4Delvibird used Evil Delivery!
4God, and then 4chan is completely devoid of common sense too
8people are stupid
8mods still havent responded to it
4Looks like I killed everybody

4Heya Nick
10Espy, when do you want me to give you that link by the way?

4Listen to it
8what is with all the hate and drama on /oat/ today?
4Faceless
6>>;
6I dislike hate and drama.
8i dont think he was now, actually, but he had a bunch of post deletions
8he might get banned yet though
4What for?
I dont listen to pony crap Hooh
4Well
4Angel is a complete douche, it's hard not to get angry at him
8well, it was based on this screenshot: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130817260132.png
6I've never really read any of Angel's posts.
if its crap i dont listen to it, ponies are crap
;P
8ah shit, thats tiny
6But I know Haack has anything and everything coming to him.
6You can pop it out, silly.
4Yep
12Floof~
6mfw
6:/
4But Angel is apparently trying to reason with Ponychan that he's not defecting or some shit
6I say if he wants to defect, let him.
6He'll be back anyway.
6They always come back.
8they should consider whether or not this is the right community for them
4And that thread is still mocking us
6Which thread is this?
/me 6is forgetful
8thread in /co/ about the scam
6Oh.
6I saw that.
4He linked the thread and all
8also, Background got banned for 24+ hours for posting a parody of the scam thread asking people to donate to animal shelters
4Too slow, Hip : /
8no ones mocking the mods in that thread that i've seen though
6Oh look at the pretty thread in meta.
4Someone is mocking the mods in it
8send me a link to the /co/ thread
8the faceless thread
4We don't need to keep this shit going, Hip.
8no no
4They're trying to stop talking about it
8i want to see if its something i should bring to the attention of the mods
6Good thing I have three more~
4That's literally all it was
8sprinkles, i am jelly
8oh ok, i misunderstood
/me yawns
8i thought you were saying faceless had posted a thread where he was encouraging people to go make fun of the mods on /meta/
4Y hallo thar

4Purple cats are the best
13;3
6>worded weird
4i even spent a week getting a global link espie
4I felt threatened, and that's not fucking fair
6It was quite rude.
13I'm still waiting for mine |D
06It's totally worth it.
06Insert pun about magically bouncing here.
4Magic Bounce + Espeon = yes
4I've never once had an issue with the mods, but she completely lost any respect from me
06That is a pretty fun ability though.
12bbl
6I usually like the mods. The fact that she went and did that was just absolutely... no.
06Ok
6I'd agree he did go overboard with it, but it seemed more like he was just poking fun.
6I could see how it could hurt feelings though.
4Maybe he was just having fun, but no one apologized to me
4Neither of them did
4Bye1
Alright I'm back!
4*!
7I have one thing to say, Fuck the Dentist
6That is a statement I agree wholeheartedly with.
4Oh shit
4N is asking to be banhammered
4Seriously
6Parasprite detected.
6I need to find a tuba.
4Go to /oat/, Hip
4You'll see it
8what was the peanut/!!scootaloo thing about
4I can't speak to you about it, Hip, otherwise I'll be banhammered
8tell me here
8mods cant reach you here
6Well, she told us, rather.
/me flooooofs
4She threatened me
4And acted like a complete douche and disrespected me
4And pissed me off more
8same deal with !!Twilight

/me makes a generator taking advantage of this
/me millionaire
/me guinea pig
/me sad
8oh, i believe you
/me 13happyface
/me 4shaves Espeons for floof
13;-;
6She was being quite rude.
06That's illegal.
8what was she saying
8?
8paraphrased
/me 4goes to jail for Espeon shaving
6Hence why I haven't said.
4!Pokemon
4It went beyond that though
Hooh54, you are a 12Audino.
6Even though SHE told US.
8but wait, how did you find out?
6She told us.
8was it on a thread?
6Flat out told us.
/me 4gets out of jail with Audino powers
6Nope. In here.

4Peanut has the mods on tab
Nick, you are a 13Bayleef.
4SO I guess he's friends with them or something
6Exactly. I can't go that far.
4!POKEMON
Hooh54, you are a 12Tropius.

7Thats Amonisis for you, undyingly optimistic and usally won't listen to reason :D
8pretty much
7He's still awesome though
8i like him though
6I have no issue with Amonisis. Don't know him well enough to say either way.
4I used to dislike Amo with a passion
8Amonisis is basically the "good angel" on the shoulder of ponychan
7Who's the bad one.....
4Too much floof
06never
8maybe Whelp?
13Never enough
4True

8maybe Haackula
06But yeah
06good night

13Nighty night~
6I dislike Haack.
10Yawning in contagious
7Haack is just silly
:3
Nii
8sometimes i can tolerate him, sometimes i just want him to leave the site
6It's when he starts going "Doesn't this belong in /boardnamehere/" that bugs me.
6It's like, no, it belongs in /oat/, deal with it.
6I have no dislike towards most ponies.
6I tolerate most of them.
10Pipe'd
6With ALLCAPS and everything.
7He's such an asssssssss
7Yes, that is like, Attention horse over 9000
12Wb
6Most ponies are tolerable because they only have a few flank moments here and there.
7Thanks.
6He is like... UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
8lol
Haha
8talking about the /meta/ thread, i assume?
His router was unplugged :p

4Yep
8what about him?
8yeah
7astray? whos that?
7Explain
6If you don't know, you don't want to.
8while he was doing that, he was also talking about sexually abusing minors and calling us gay for liking ponies
7Then....why the fuck was he here?
6To train us to stream.
6Thank Celestia we shouldn't have to deal with him now.
8lol i dunno
7what a dumbass
7man /oat/ sure is boring today, (besides the whole donation thing)

4I think the quality is a little fuzzy
bbl
Though the enjoyment that I experience after performing said activity may not live up the pleasure gained from the anticipated experience.
LOL
he has several concert exclusive songs
10Bye NS :<
Bye NS ;o
/me makes out with Sky again :o
10Armageddon is missing out
5Haha. The main thing people tape about Rush's concerts are Neil Peart's solos, because each show is slightly different.
Oh well
heh
well
5Live albums are awesome.. sometimes.
too much cheering LOL
5Like "Exit... Stage Left" (yes that is a Snagglepuss reference xD) is a great live album.
5Which ones are tho--?
5Fall Out Boy is terrible live too. D:
Linkin Park is like that too
well
yes, but, I only care about catchiness LOL
8silver, i was going to cover EQD, /collab/ and /chat/, if i remember correctly
5I care about musicianship. =P
I don't mind processing as long as it's not stupidly annoying (a la T-Pain)
I have to get my hands on this soundtrack.
5It's like 150% every show. xD;
5Ugh Autotune.
or anyone
like EW MILEY CYRUS
5She doesn't use Autotune does she?
all you need now to be famous is publicity.
yes she does
like EVERYONE uses autotune now LOL
5Nooooooooooo~ D:
5I mean I never liked her in the first place
5but still! D:
Lawl, everyone.
XD
Only in pop.
>__>
11Thanks.
well
not always
5I thought she actually had integrity.
5GEDDY LEE HAS NEVER USED AUTOTUNE. <3
they've used "pitch correction" for years
autotune is just an extreme example of that
LOL
EW METAL
:O
EW POP
:<
the only music I can't stand
Ew Rap
5D:
/me shot
5HOW
is country and metal/screamo/w/e
EW RAP
LOL
Hip-hopera is the best
No, metal is best.
4I'll be right back, gotta close my tabs
metal is just screaming >_>
LOL
synthesizers ftw
DRF, GTFO if you think that. >__>
well
Metallica is good
Synthies :D
agreed
are awesome songs
CoB are awesome.
80s synth pop is amazing
4Alright, back
eh
5Cygnus X-1 is an epic prog song haha~
never been into CoB
My favourite music is 70s and 80s synth XD
How about A7X?
I generally just like anything upbea
t
A7X has too much screaming for me
Afterlife is alright, though.
5http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwNlbqol_8 <--- This is an example of too much synth D: (Sorry the quality's kinda bad. xD; )
8mods still havent responded to my /meta/ thread, do you think i should report it
8?
5That is an example of TOO MUCH SYNTH and not enough bass. D:
inb4 needs more cowbell
5Oh ha~

Hey
11What /meta/ thread?
/me dumps all the links he has found recently.
XD
5It's actually a very sad song, lyrically.
the onlgy Rush song I heard is YYZ
that was pretty good
5GYAH
5YOU NEED MOAAR
No he doesn't
:>
5If you thought YYZ was good you need to hear La Villa Strangiato. (Another instrumental.)
5Spirit of Radio has an epic beginning though~
I hate the beginning
5And some of the lines are--
5WHAT?
and instrumentals ftw
5You were not blown away by the epic riff?
5What song starts with a RIFF?
I was looping an instrumental of Don't Stop Believin earlier
o.o
5Oh lol
I have one, its very rare
.
more than anything else XD
hey
10Loltiming

Laptop closed for a minute

But oh well, he should of died
I was all ZOMFG DON'T DIE

Cool!
Heya LLOTS :P
5Mainly because my dog's getting older and we know she's on her last proverbial ....
5**proverbial leg
as much as I like dogs, movies about dogs are getting old.
I liked the movie Good Boy, though
Same
XD
10[21:23] <@Sneas> goddamn alot of shit <- But hey, it's activity :3
I HATED that book
5I was in like 4th grade man, give me a break. D:
And I was scared for the time the dogs nearly got shaved LOL
5:C
same with TKAMB and Tuck Everlasting
I could not stand either
Yeah, but people complain about ponies when there's pretty much no activity otherwise anyway.
5Tuck Everlasting was overrated.
5But seriously? TKAMB was a masterpiece.
8exactly
10On second thought I should've probably made that expire
5Not as much as 1984 though.
10Oh well
5OR FAHRENHEIT 451
1984 was awesome

5FREAKING VACCINATIONS. ><

4What do you guys think?
11Hmm...Ghosties was right. The picture is a little fuzzy. But otherwise it's good.
6I can't run it at high res, which is why it's fuzzy.
6I'm working out the kinks a little more.
5HUZZAH.
6Had to turn up the sound there. XD
6Forgot to turn it up on VLC
That's just destructive.
8quality is slightly lower than DCD's but it'll work
8also, interesting choice of episode
6I just picked whatever my mouse was on.
4See the fuzz we're talking about, Sprinks?
6Yeah.
6It's not horrible, but it's there.
6Friend's never seen the stream and he says it's good enough that it wouldn't bother him. But that may be slightly biased.
8i wish i had IRL friends that would be fine with watching ponies... sigh
6I have a few IRL friends that watch ponies.

From wiki.
" According to the movie he lost his thumb by the circular saw at the beginning of the Dudesons´ career. The preserved thumb can be seen in Season 3, Episode 7: "The return of Jarppi's thumb"."

"The Sun's gone dim, and the sky's turned black"
No way. O_o

You play the role of a male work pony trying to turn a defiled farm around
You can also date one of the mane six
xD
and eventually marry them
xD
Oh yeah
I am meh about this idea.
greetings xD
Hey rev...
Oh fun. OpenGL in C++ or java?
Java
On one hand, dating Applejack would be pretty cool, but then again, watching other people talk about how they married Pinkie Pie would not be 'superfuntastic'.
Haaave fuuuun.
I haven't done C/C++ for years
I always have fun <3
Mmm
lol, yes
Actually, shipiing between anyone normal and PP would be scary in the first place.
Took the body pillow to the wedding.
Now I'm savvy with it's nice...
And OpenGL on Java isn't too bad. lwjgl and slick2D are plenty good for using it.
I just can't get behind shipping PP with anyone because it requires a personality overhaul just to make it feasible.
Silly
and drag
Same here.
6How have you been?
gingerale: If you're sticking to 2D it wouldn't be bad, no. It's just both java and JOGL are....bulky. Full 3D is deadly to framerates
No interest with going there.. I kind of hate 3D rendering.. Bad experiences back when I thought it'd be cool. <.<
*from
That wouldn't be HM at all.

Nothing is wrong with that, but SOME people here aren't gay.

13Oh. Okay :)
13So, whatcha been doing?
Honestly, all cartoon shows have at least ONE character that is gay
You're welcome!
fillyfoolers = implication of pedophilia
Lexington from Gargoyles was gay
Dumbore is gay
XD
Fillydelphia = disturbing
:T
Literally...
>:T
I'm being corkscrewy with the series...
YOU GOT ONE HOUR
SOLVE IT
I like to think of Twilight as bicurious but other than that I don't actually lesbian ponies indiscriminately
A good chunk of cartoonist out there intend for at least one character to be homosexual, but censors continue to keep these characters quiet
Oh yeah
:O
Here we go, Fassad....

If I followwed the Blessed Agonies's list, Lucas literally did have completed the list MORE than once...
I mean she did collect more grist three of the four kids ever collected.

Hey :o
I'm BARELY awake
yep
5xD Hi Sky.
Hey RP4L :)
gaaaaaah
13Please make no negitive comments about it. It took me four months to build, and it's still growing.
30 minutes of "sleep" and no caffeine after staying up for like 20 hours
13ohai RP4L :3
5O-o;
5Geez, what's the occasion, Sky?
Education.
/me 5waves to Angel_Espeon~ :3

Wow
5You're not out for summer?
I just discovered the convert ink feature in OneNote
Canadians end in June
It's surprising accurate
:P
and hi guys
5Aaahh, okay, I see.
Hey eX
5eXAKR, I think that feature is annoying. xD It usually doesn't work that well for me.
And oh?
5Oh, haha! xD Thank you~
I scribbled cursive, and it worked perfectly
5Hm.. well, it wasn't /OneNote/ I used but a similar program.
Cats crossbreeding with poptarts
/me shivers
But how else do people improve other than by constructive criticism?
5LOL~ xD
Oh
I don't have anything negative to say anyway though.
Maybe they are not as good then
5Nyan nyan nyan nyan~
5Nah, probably not
And Nyan Cat <3
5but my handwriting is kind of sloppy. :P
13and delicious
13sexy and delicious
5Strawberry Poptarts aren't that great IMO.
13|D
5I prefer --
5xDD
4God theres a lack of Cynder and Angel
13It's not criticism. It's infomation and my thoughts. And that's good there is nothing negitive about it
13You saw the Legado, DSD?
13What'd you think?
5(...Primarily because I also play Alto Saxophone.)
LOL
4It was cool
5Eeeeeeeeveryone in my section last year knew how to play that.
5And of course as section leader I made sure they all did. (;
4Ok Uxie do you think we should get coverart for all the games
5RAINBOWS ARE AMAZING. :3
5Noooooooo
5It's just a single rainbow.
5Come on man.
4Meaning xbox gamcube and PS2 versions of the games
13Yes, we should
5SO INTEEEEEENSE
5>:D
Epic intensity
:o
4ok

RP4L
/me hides
8D
5NUUUUUUUUUUU
5NOT THE PONIES. D:
Yup
Yeah Roleplay4life
Ew
Did someone say Epic Sax Man?
5What?
Ponies.
5WHAAAAT
I got suckered into MLP:FiM
Someone showed me that last night
5>:C
I died a little.
The characters are just so...ugh
Especially Dash
If you watched the pilots then I can understand why.
He just makes me want to find a rainbow and punch it in the face.
13Ponies again
/me hides
Yeah, i think I'll turn in for now xD
No ponies.
Also, Rainbow Dash pony is best pony.
13and Rainbow Dash is a girl lol
Never ponies.
5THERE IS A LINE
Cya'll later xD
/me makes note: no ponies for Roleplay4life
and Rainbow Dash is a girl lol <--- I am SCARED.
Rush.
RUSH.
RUUUUUUUUUUUUSH.
06I'll stick to brownies
13Brownies <3
06the title of that is rather suitable
/me throws brownies at RP4L
:D
5............ :3
I haven't been on Silverwings in like 2 years
5Seriously?
Yet I still recognize like everyone
Yep
Fluttershy caring for the legendary birds <3
eXARK, you, Angel, Espeon
:P
RP4L
I wanted to tell you before but
I kind of turn up intermittently for a few months then disappear.
Because I can't write it anymore
LOL
dari, how long have you been with TST?
5Which story, Sky? D:
RP4L: You know which one.
5Er, which story of mine. xD
Roleplay4life
I don't actually use the forum, but the first time I've been on here was probably in 2009.
4Um
LOL
4The BBS part
5Oh, Cut to the Chase.
dari: Probably why I haven't seen you, I became inactive around 2009
Was active from 2006-2009
5In that picture.
http://i.imgur.com/txBzs.jpg <- I think that Peach is into drag racing :P
RP4L
There's no shells of any colour variation here.
I was one of the people that got her back to writing it
LOL
5I mean
And I updated a chapter of mine too
also, that stupid freaking horse is in the race.
5I think it's really cool she's getting back into it
Though that chapter is a tragedy
5I mean one writer to another
I usually don't check other people'
people's fanfics*
? Horse?
Are you sure?
I instantly liked yours
Randomly clicking on it on dA
:P
Because he looks like a horse to me.
LOL
5When it comes to fanfics I'm really motivated at first but if I feel like no one reads then.. yeah..
But yeah it comes with the job
Yeah!
Not many people read fanfics anymore on the boards
Not even the RP board.
5(I read 'em. o-o)
yes
Lmao RP4L, it's been like that in terms of comments for a long time for me.
Hence the lack of motivation to do more :P
5Yeah but the weird thing is that I'm getting a LOT more faves than I used to
I don't touch the "Other" board, though I do know of them.
5but a lot LESS views and comments.
:P
13And I'm glad you like the BbS part, even though it's not quite finished
5df'dsaglkjlas;dgka; it's really frustrating.
4Olympus Coliseum
5Yeah I suppose, but I really only work on one fanfic at a time. xD
4Uxie did you see my Userpage on the spyro wiki yet?
4I just updated it
13Cool!
5Even if something doesn't turn out how I like I still SLAVE over it for a week or more.
13I also like Halloween Town and Timeless River!
4So i take it you guys don't want to be co-founders of the spyro DA group?
4DX
5I like how, on DeviantART, you can get to a point of popularity where if you scribbled "hi!" and a stick figure on a napkin people would FAVEBOMB it and it'd get at least 100 faves. xD
13I'm still part of it. I'm even going to draw all 14 Talismans for it! (Check my SW userpage)
4I know but no one wants to be co-founders
13I'm a co-founder!
4!

13I'm currently working on the Glimmer Talisman: Magic Pick. Should be done by Saturday

Lemme guess, it was a scam
it was found out that it was a scam
No.
yup
and basically a bunch of threads popped up
Well, at least I can pick out my own messages this way.
Huh.
5.....SCORE! 8D
I don't know why it's set like this, then.
and amonisis (one of the "popular" users) decided to "test" ponychan
Ikr
I never donate money because I don't have a job
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/arch/res/2497750.html
Does this work?
I'll read it later

I can't handle both school and a job at the same time
Wasn't interested at all until I saw gameplay of OoT-3D.
Lies
8you should totally show an episode of Kenan and Kel
i wanna experience it myself first before i decide
ikr
At least ponies are helping push me through it :D
stupid exams now
I'm taking summer courses now
Feels bad man
But, one is weather, and weather is interesting
The other is like music 103 or something silly
lol
I don't HAVE to take it
GAH i should really be studying for functions right now
6...if I can find one.
6I should look for that.
I should be mowing the lawn right now.

<_<
5NOTHING IS REAL

i'm pretty sure we're all supposed to be doing something right now
6YOUTUBE Y U BUFFER?
Actually
I literally have nothing to do for the next 16 hours

4Nuuuu'
I'm just that amazing
Which you'll put off for 15 hours.
:P
^
Yes
8ill look it up

4Youtube hates me right now
It hates everyone
Music theory goes over my head
Why do I have the sudden idea...
4none of the videos work D :
it's already been done
8heres a good one: http://megavideo.com/?v=P6OINJH5
I didn't know that.
Yeah :(
wait

Twilight: ...No, I did that.
Yeah copyrights are crap
I copy right this
4True
whoops
I copyright that
Well
that wasn't ponies i was thinking of
6>:(
5It's all like.. community service. xD
Sharing
5Yeah!
*Caring

But yeah, copytube is evil
6WHY CAN I NOT SEE MEGAVIDEO?
/me yaaaaaaawns
wow i'm retarded
5YES
5FFFFFFFFF
4YES
02(Inb4: Angel_Espeon)
Its one thing to take down the videos of the actual movie
5That's just stupid!
But amvs....that's ridiculous
4I hate when they take down movies
4And they want you to go to some stupid poll site
14Oh yes.
Don't ask why I changed ponies.
I just
Actually.
83
kyaaa doushio
Someone needs to remix "Cookin' by the Book"
With ponies.
14._. I like my distance thanks
:D
4Well that's stupid
5UGH I hate those poll sites. xDD
Problem really?
;p
5HML YES I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
12.... pwease... I good boi
5(Because it's my fave movie~)
Oh, gawd. At least it isn't "You are a pirate"
5I may /understand/ but that doesn't mean I agree with their policies necessarily. =P
I don't see any reason for there to be one for "You are a Pirate", as it's probably already done.
dunno...for things like the story of young mewtwo
Which is near impossible to find
Those should be allowed up
depends on the company
5Sakuya, actually that one's pretty easy to find. I've found it dubbed at then in raw Japanese.
How sad, I killed someone just by entering...
There's no reasons for someone to put Ponies to Starcraft 2, either.
5Mmm, yeah, I know.
5YT I have no issue with. xD
*reason
12She's just doing her own thing
8bye chobi

/me flops
12She'll be back
Can anyone give me some advice on my 4 pony characters? --> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJoBTIs2NRZM_4kSRVAN2VqZQzwIGTPqKTfyK_CqZFs/edit?hl=en_US
Lol
Well there's that
!Espeon
/me now belongs to lightumbreon for 12 minutes
5And the entire Star Trek TOS series is on YT. ALL OF IT. EVERY EPISODE.
I hate it the most when they take off OSTs :P
!lightumbreon
/me eeps
5I tell ya that's a lot more popular and in demand than some obscure Jap' version a Pokeymanz movie.
Because she is purple.
14Hopefully.
I can relate to that statement.
Purple is the best color
I agree with that too. But Pinkie Pie is the best. ^_^
I chose purple as a compromise :D
XD
12Anyways, how are doing?
6No, it just doesn't display like, anything.
14I'm fine. How about you?
Dunno, I remember all my videos going down cuz of shogakuken
Pinkie pie is no doubt the best pony for PMVing
14Still doing your....thing?

O_O

hellow fireant
lord of the rings

yes
6AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS! FY! :D
8i am
4LORD OF THE PENGUINS
/me does this
You put '/me' before you say anything
4why?
/me /me like this
Alright.
8because it makes sense
Muthafudger!
*shot and beaten
14brb a sec
8actually, no, i dont want them to be merged, i want them to be changed
4?
4Delicious
8so /oat/ would be "general randomness" and /chat/ would be "serious non-pony discussion"
hmm
Join the club.
how do you use mibbit to get here?
a friend can't use the ED client
/me rolls in the grass
4I rarely see any pony threads over in /chat/
welcome
it's not on the list of servers
I am using mibbit
have you watch it?
welcome
MPR: connect to this server from any IRC client using irc.lightirc.com
/me rolls in the grass again
I'm just using the page's built-in client.
IIRC

7Well, the main ones.
And we've still got like 50 episodes to go
7The total base 580 ones and some 600 ones aren't.
But really, it's similar to Ponies
It tosses realistic situations at the characters
Wurk tiem, later ponies
Without being "preachy" about morals
y'know
xcept they fight the forces of evil more often
:P
Adios
