Oh wow, I didn't realise Free shipping was there in deviantart :O
then resort to trying to kill myself again
Saturn: Holla! :)

/me hugs Saturn.
0,5The best way to try and cheer up is to not think about it, rather than tell everyone about it.
I'm just gonna go...
0,5Well this isn't a place to discuss this kind of thing, no offense.

0,5Someone else's depression is not my problem.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6f8q-r9HM
Yes, but this is a public forum. If you're depressed you need intimacy, hence why you're being asked to go to PM.
Aw
This is making me depressed
I did manage to lure Saturn into my room
13now let's get something straight
13how many of you have actually suffered from depression
/me raises hand.
I have.
http://youtu.be/PgmXy-CqXP0?t=8s
/me raises hand
I suppose. I don't do it that often
13then you know that rational thought isn't typically part of the process
Is Suicide a case or variation of Depression?
Well, I haven't been diagnosed.
The last time I did it I sent some one to their Room
I've been victim of ecstatic emotions a lot.
Does that count?
13i've been more or less bipolar for the last five years
13point is
13reason doesn't work
13yes
They can do that much, right?
We are talking about people talking about depression. Wut is this I don't even. I am sad naow.
0,5Taking it somewhere else doesn't require much decision-making
13just always remember
awkward silence? :/
13what if you kick them out on grounds of being an attention whore
00,03IN OTHER NEWS....
13and you're wrong?
oh
Yes yes. I get it. We don't want a bunch of people coming in here talking about their issue potentially scaring viewers/chatters off.
I think I understand to say the least
Can we move on?

MCDONALDS APPLE PIE
05,15I don't typically eat fast food if I can help it
that is a redonculous inventory
McDonald's apple pies... now THAT'S not food.
hey guys we could see the 3rd season here th saturday 10
fast food makes me sick
Saturn: Sauce,cheese and grilled onions
!cd
08,01man, i'm hungry now
^
08,01i want a burger
It's 2:30 AM
08,01and fucking chips
^
08,01i had some wonderful chips last night
McDonalds gives children the adult amount of calories in their kids meals
08,01fluttercry: oh, McBaby?
Is that opposed to chips that don't engage in intercourse Saturn?
Chips are just potatoes
But you can't boil em
05,15Oh yeah that's another thing. We don't get chips. Closest thing we've got are Steak Fries
GIMME MCPIES
or mash em
or stick em in a stew
08,01Sketch_Toku_Brony: we don't get Wendy's in Scotland
mcdonalds burgers never spoil
mcnuggies
STEAK FRIES ARE AMAZING
YES DIG UP THE BODY
i hate mcdonalds
hello
Fast food is all shite at the end of the day.
FRIES
It's just varying degrees of it.
McDonald's is apocalypse food. Never goes bad, and if you're not picky it tastes decent.

Pizza is like sex. When it's good, it's awesome, and when it's bad, it's pretty good.
Papa John's is delicious.
mmm Braum's
yeah everfree radio's episode reviews are pretty biased
Doesn't anyone just enjoy a Subway for lunch?
05,15Dominoes is pretty good if they have a special that makes them cheeper I'd order there
Papa Johns <3
I saty away frome verfree radio
I can't freaking type today
Subway: Eat freah out of our factory processed foods
yeah
08,01dominoes texas BBQ is possibly the most delicious thing
Still too much for me to pick them over Papa John's though.
08,01apart from chenna and puri
Subway sucks
You suck.
he seems like he's struggling to keep a straight face
I weigh 125...
Faaaaaaaaaat.

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Michelle Creber's Indiegogo Campaign
11,02SpeccyRush: Yesh

oh shit

smack em up son
/me blinks
oh cool
never been to a con :/
I bought my GBA when I was 10 just because there were Spyro games on it
^
Same with my DS
-.-
How hard are the other versions of the mansion?
Creepy dude is creepy
I now regret the waste of money
Its-a-toad
I agree
Imo, both series are different
I haven't played the last two games
DotD or Skylanders
enter the dragonfly was horrible. glithc city.
I actually really liked ETD haha
and dissapeared
I might one day but it's not high on my priority list
Is it possible to get any mice you missed before the blackout when said event happens?
and the weird thing was that there was absolutely no glitches that messed up the gameplay
/me hums along with the mansion theme
i think you can get the mice you missed in the blackout
but amybe that's jsut blue ghosts
inb4 that creepy talking painting scene that made me shit my pants
there's one collectible that if you leave the area after activating the platforms needed to reach it but before collecting it.
i know you can get the blue ones regardless and shit, i'm just saying you can probably reget em if you missed em during the blackout
the first legend of slyro gae was, well.... EASY.
did stream stop?
yup
hm, stopped for me
and refreshing dont help
I thought it was hard. :<
you just need to refresh though
oh there it is, nvm
Speedy Spirits.
the second one, well... it was a lot harder.
I found it a nice touch that the portraits change design depending on rank
And I couldn't figure out how to beat that train thing for the longest time
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
hmm.
well i got to go, night everyone :)
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
I raged pretty hard at some of the bosses in TEN
Is this the first one?
Yep.
Freaking Arborik
That's the only boss I remember the name of
Night twiolioght_spankle and Ayejay :3

Laptops are bastards to build
but since I would never buy a gaming laptop, it doesn't matter
WOO Keytar
laptops for gaming are a lie anyway, no matter if apple or not
hey guys a

that's--it
I HATE island keyboards

THIS ONE
OH GAWD
Henry to the 8th power?
Hated this puzzle
HINT HINT
Nice
main problems with laptops. cooling
Yeah laptops yeah- tend to get hot
Technically it's the opposite
inm the main menu go to the DO A THING screen
Keytars are a keyboard on a strap, with the mod-wheel and shit on the handle
Cooling pad we used kept breaking
Get a different one
Nah
One with at least 5k RPM should work
which is probably the reason this thing is way slower than it should be
Mine's got ok fans, but- I dunno, yeah, it would get way too hot if I put any games on it
My PC's fans are gigantifucking huge
I bought it because it had a numpad
on computer I have Razer keyboard- kinda hate it
Yeah, I heard good things about those-
Also, never get island keyboards unless you're wierd
I kinda want a early 90s ibm keyboard
an*
got a nice quadcore in here. with booster tech. can get up to 3.2gigs if needed. in theory at least. in reality, it barely goes above 50% of capacity
http://www.dansdata.com/images/clicky/ballboard1024.jpg I had a keyboard like this, kinda
loved it-
Woah, it even has a trackpad
yeah- mine didn't
but it was that spring-mechanic thing
that was a sad day
Aww
Ooh
My old IBM one had like vents under
Only area that shows wear is the bottom, where some of the paint has worn away
it survived anything- even getting dropped repeatedly
all by myself... dont wanna be...
Only problem with the G15 is size, and it only has USB1.0 on it
yeah. playing catch with yourself...
I don't need APM, but I like to type a lot, and ghosting is actually bothersome-
My typing is just fine
I even speak fully in texts D:
:p
lol ikr
on the Razer it ghosts the T and various other letters, if nearby keys are being held
if I'm typing like a madman-
that might be bothersome
Thought he said Butt Bots for a second.
bai guys

Hehe

Well, wireless controllers are nice

oh, I see
Oh GTS I see you are full of bullshit as always
it's always been like that
They really need to take care of that level 9 or under legendary bullshit
Also one time when I searched for a reshiram a executor showed up....for some reason
I think it's because they were hacked or something
Also I wish the GTS gave me a list of all the options instead of a select few...but anyway hows everyone doing
things are well
any word from the folks in NY/Jersey?

Hello, everyone
a pokeball?
A single pokeball, not even a critical capture
I caught steel with a premere ball
I once caught groudon with a diveball
Black/White 2 has no roaming legends
They arent in the sequel
I think
oh
Even Cresellia is in it
And she's a stationary one
probably because they had more character than may/brendan and maybe barry
And the fact they arent total assholes
I guess
not much activity in the room?
slow as usual
Gotta go fast
