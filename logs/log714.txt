I just feel really worthless, and I'm not motivated to do things I enjoy anymore or try to improve.
FIRE THE HAPPINESS BEAM!!
Bronysith: It's cheered me up from time to time.
:I
I just know I'll fail everytime, and be laughed at everytime
0,5Because this is totally a mental clinic or something
Fluffy: How long has this been going on?
and that's why I'm sad
:L
Months. I went to the hospital for trying to commit suicide
ugh
/me blasts off away from stupid drama
i need something to TRY to cheer me up, since this has been the worse day i've had in my life
Polydunami: It said Free shipping over the picture
good riddance, Bronysith
eep what happened
And drama is real life. Jesus
-.-
/me crash lands and murders twilight_sprinkle
0,5Who needs drama
Polydunami: That is so darn cute!
BBC does apparently. They do make some pretty good dramas though.
-facedesk- I just came here because I'd rather try to cheer up
08,01'lo gildash
then resort to trying to kill myself again
what do you know, it's a faker
*than
0,5The best way to try and cheer up is to not think about it, rather than tell everyone about it.
but anyway Fluffy ,just keep living really, everyone has those moments, youll find something you like to do no doubt
I'm just gonna go...
hope things get better for ya Fluffy
Fluffy: NNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
bye guys. :L
BaconMane: its really hard not to think about him

/me HUGS EVERYONE IN THIS CHAT!!!!!
/me hugs Celestia`s_Bunny back
Whoo! Hugs!

twilight_sprinkle: then why didnt you ignore him?

Scoot-Scootaloo: new Megas XLR rumor
...FLUTTERSHY! YOU GOT SUM EXPLAINING TO DO!
Bronysith: because i dont assume everyone is an attention whore just because theyre sad
00,03Sorry I don't listen to rap, Bronysith...
Scoot-Scootaloo: you don't want to watch Megas XLR?
00,03Eh, it never grew on me :/
0,5twilight_sprinkle, you forget that I can't ignore issues in the chat because I'm part of the team.
Mares Dig Giant Robots, I dig them too. We all digs giant robots...
00,03Now Clifford the Big Red Dog...
...Cause...y'know...they're cool.
>Not in Scoot-Scootaloo 's hipster circle

00,03^^^^^
00,03:D
I get it though.
/me hipster glasses
Dammit I have to attend another boring site visit at an oil refinery...
Oh, and by the way Scoots, Megas XLR is about this fat blob and his skinny friend who has this FUCKING GIANT ROBOT that he customized...
...And that robot was...FROM SPAAAAAAACE....
BaconMane: well how is it an issue, since when is being sad against the rules? him being an attention hog is a personal guess, nothing more
Actually that does sound like rap VenHur
All right, I must depart. I have something to attend to... Muahahaa!
Had one last friday at a composite material producing factory. Boring as hell.
Bye, Everlasting_Joy. :)

Hi, Rainboom. :)
Hi Rainboom :)
hi Rainboom
Alchemist, I dunno
hoi Rainboom
Hi Invi
Hi Rainboom.
0,5Please quit arguing with me. When someone is feeling depressed, they shouldn't come onto IRC and tell everyone. "Hey everyone im depressed, just thought you should know that." it's called PM, for a private matter.
A valid point and well made.
^
0,5hey, PM works for "private matter" as well. hehehe
BaconMane: O U
0,5O ME
o u
0,5o me
BaconMane: its not a big deal if someone does it.
u o
BaconMane: you make me sad
I don't see why if you were depressed you'd want everyone to know anyway. :S
To talk about it
To get attention
Rarity has them Pout
OH GAWD
Yadda yadda, rabble rabble
13in other news
13http://i.imgur.com/nIjn9.jpg
We watched Rebuild last night
so i guess sad people dont exist and dont deserve any attention and should just be considered attention hogs and kicked out of chat. mhm, very civil, chat.
Shizuka: What's the treat? I see no sweets
Shizu I would not trust it.
13Polydunami: i know, i left before ramiel .-.
13was 3:30 >>
0,5Yes, it is a big deal, because others in the chat get annoyed and distracted, and even saddened. It's a private matter which should be handled privately. You seem to think just because they are sad/depressed means they have some kind of special right.
is someone acting like a special snowflake again or something?
http://youtu.be/rnPfpSja5tk
What if people tell each other happy things?
0,5And the number of fohcks I give is at a minimum
00,03Dat candy cane wall of text
Eh. It ain't going to stop though.
I dun care either way.
I just see it as it is.
I'm just going to take a step back and wait this one out.
08,01BaconMane: i was all set to disagree with you, but you're right. if someone wants to tlak about their issues, maybe the extent to what they should say in chat is "hey, anyone mind if i rant at them", or something similar
08,01and wax emo in PM
#DarkDepressingThoughts
CRAAAAAAWLING IIIIII MY SKIIIIIIIIN
0,5Someone else's depression is not my problem.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm6f8q-r9HM
BaconMane: thats a good attitude
Yes, but this is a public forum. If you're depressed you need intimacy, hence why you're being asked to go to PM.
Aw
This is making me depressed
Okay, who's talking about me in here? I just sneezed 5 times in a row :|
WHY IS THE CHAT MAKING SENSE!!!
HE did not stick around for the candy
13now let's get something straight
See, Barb, using so-called hashtags here on bronystate can be mistaken for channel advertisement.
13how many of you have actually suffered from depression
/me raises hand.
I have.
http://youtu.be/PgmXy-CqXP0?t=8s
/me raises hand
I suppose. I don't do it that often
Shizuka: DEPRESSION IS MY WORST ENEMY!!!
13then you know that rational thought isn't typically part of the process
Is Suicide a case or variation of Depression?
Well, I haven't been diagnosed.
The last time I did it I sent some one to their Room
I've been victim of ecstatic emotions a lot.
Does that count?
Shizuka: ^
/me 08,01raises a hoof
Vordox: well, more like a possible outcome, but i think its pretty much related.
13i've been more or less bipolar for the last five years
13point is
13reason doesn't work
0,5So fine, they don't think rationally and they start talking about it publicly. I still need to ask them to take it to somewhere private.
13yes
They can do that much, right?
Shizuka: The thing that got me out of it, was a handy slap to the face by my friends. Helped me out and now I'm alive and happy person.
We are talking about people talking about depression. Wut is this I don't even. I am sad naow.
BaconMane: well at least do it politely, not gtfo dude nobody cares
0,5Taking it somewhere else doesn't require much decision-making
13just always remember
08,01though "bringing the chat down" isn't exactly in the rules as a no-no
awkward silence? :/
13what if you kick them out on grounds of being an attention whore
00,03IN OTHER NEWS....
13and you're wrong?
chat is making sense again
Shizuka: ...Bad choice due to hasty decision?
Rainboom, no. modwar
oh
Yes yes. I get it. We don't want a bunch of people coming in here talking about their issue potentially scaring viewers/chatters off.
I think I understand to say the least
Shizuka: thats what im saying. its better to give a bit of attention to an attention whore than not to give it to someone who needs it
Can we move on?
00,03Ahem http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c7IYM9Q7PE
13this being the internet it's fairly common to have attention whores, but don't let me catch you jumping to conclusions
http://youtu.be/Q_D7Ov0xKts Now pay attention to me guys
0,5And twilight_sprinkle: At what point did I tell anyone to "get the fuck out?" I didn't say nobody cared, I said I didn't care, and I suppose I implied that there are others who don't care as well. Also, Shizu, I wouldn't kick them out of the chat, I would ASK them to take it somewhere else to discuss it with those who want to help.
but Shizuka i am an atention whore
0,5*phew*
0,5lotsa typin
LOL Scoot-Scootaloo ! XD
13http://i.imgur.com/6htGn.jpg or else shizu will let you know what five years of bipolar builds into
Well, at least they didn't succeed at getting all our attentions...
damn it's like the danger zone up in here
O_O what did I come back to?
08,01i think it's fine to discuss issues in here to a certain extent. we're supportive, but we're not a support group
put some horses on the screen or something
Panda-: Long story.
Shizuka: Knew you would find a use for that...
all i wanted was a stream and i get this
BaconMane: well you werent terribly polite about it, like the clinic thing. you couldve instead said "sorry, but please dont talk about that in here as others might get depressed too" or something like that
AJIsAwesome, could ja pm me about it? O_o
Quick
Some one
Spam ponies
wait wait wait
PONIES!

Spam's against the rules though. XD
GilDash: That's why... I'm a doer person, not a talker.
00,03YES!
BaconMane: i mean you can do both, not depress the guy further and ask him to take it elsewhere
I do what I do cause I do what I think I should do, without words. :P

How hot can you be when you're named Barbara.
The answer, if life experience is to be believed, is not very.
The Biohazard games are unborn to me.
When hinges creak in doorless chambers, and strange and frightning sounds echo into the halls, whenever candlelights flicker, where the air is deadly still...
brb
I just can't wait until Assassin's Creed 3

That is the time when ghosts are present...praticing their terror with ghoulish delight
05,15And then Gigabit was a Shelder
...that sounds more epic hearing Paul Frees say it than just reading it
05,15oni_link I played Resident Evil 2 so many times that I can play start to finish in about 2 hours
/me just remembered that a evil dead remake is coming soon
You wanna hear something funny? The guy who made Gears of War joked that Capcom should call him up so he can "fix" Resident Evil.
05,15lol
hehe
Seems everyone has the same problem about resident evil 6
fluttercry: both stories?, including Leon B and Claire B?
back
isn't 6 more action shooter than horror?
CriticKitten: That's like calling someone who works in a sewer to work on the new Windows OS.
When you're the butt of a joke by a guy who made "grey-brown shooters galore" a multi-million dollar FPS movement, you dun goofed
Both shit in their own ways but wouldn't be better for having a different kind of shit.
05,15SpeccyRush|Contestin Leon A and B, I didn't like Claire that much for some reason
fluttercry: wow that is like me with OOT, beat it in one sitting in a matter of hours. I really ought to play RE2 again, it was good. But thats on my list after I beat the Remake of RE1
What the..?
BARBIE DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR

(Since it links a whole site than just an image)
Why is chat currently talking about gays and religion? Isn't that stuff supposed to not be allowed in here for the sake of not causing shitstorms?

Quit Domo you 'aint G.

Meanwhile: I actually eat a lot, and I look pretty skinny. :D
Honestly, kicking most fastfood is probably one of the best things you can do. Most fast food will put you at 1000 calories for ONE meal and cost 2x-5x as much as making something yourself
Thank you Tom
razorwing1269: yep :)
08,01Sketch_Toku_Brony: sounds delicious

Nowadays I don't do much fast food, I mainly go with sandwhich shops or pizza slices, or my school's buffet which is pretty good
Pizza
goodbye
Dominoes is godly for pizza craves
08,01seriously
latas razorwing1269
we all agree Carl's Jr is best fast food restaurant right? http://derpy.me/c7rK4
08,01frak this noise
true
Geez I cn't evn eat pizza
Pizza is my everything
bye razorwing1269 :)
man now i want Little Caesar's or something :D
08,01i'm gonna open a *good* chain of fast food restaurants
razorwing1269: 12 Angry Men and Mega Shark
Little Caesers
05,15Most pizza chains are awful
Five Guys Burger and Fries.
05,15Expect Papa Johns
Happy shake
05,15Except*
ASoftFluffyThing: I have yet to go there.
I think he's trolling
Put a Happy meal in a blender
Except Peter Piper pizza
ASoftFluffyThing: I still need to try it
and drink it
08,01fluttercry: dominos here is amazing
those r delicious
Pizza is like sex. When it's good, it's awesome, and when it's bad, it's pretty good.
Papa John's is delicious.
05,15I mean you can expect it because that's what I'd order you
mmm Braum's
fluttercry: I have a local pizza joint across the street from campus that's pretty darned good
08,01i love dominoes
I LOVE Papa Johns. :D
yeah everfree radio's episode reviews are pretty biased
But so expensive. ;_;
AJIsAwesome, omylawd its delicious
NullRadix: Nope.
05,15Dominoes is pretty good if they have a special that makes them cheeper I'd order there
Papa Johns <3
I saty away frome verfree radio
Meanwhile: I would if it was near me
oni_link, they take the fries and put it in the bottom on the bag, put the burger in the middle, and dump fries on the top.
Meanwhile: Quiznoes for me
You guys like Round Table Pizza?
Dominos got better, true.
I can't freaking type today
Gawd you're all fat.
yeah
Meanwhile: I do most of the time
08,01dominoes texas BBQ is possibly the most delicious thing
So you have to near burn your hand to get to the burger and cup of fries at the bottom
Still too much for me to pick them over Papa John's though.
08,01apart from chenna and puri
ASoftFluffyThing: I must go D:
food talk in chat.... make me hungry :<
You suck.
And you're fat, so you're wrong anyway.
Meanwhile: Suk*
he seems like he's struggling to keep a straight face
oni_link: Yes you must.
05,15Pizza Hut is.....the 9th circle of Pizza hell
You're mad because you're fat.
Eating Fast food doesnt make you fat, eating fast food ALL THE TIME makes you fat.
I weigh 125...
Faaaaaaaaaat.
A******
I like Boston Market and their carver sandwiches. Like there Turkey n' Swiss with the Parmesaen dressing, and red potatoes on the side
not reall
Oh god please let's not get into weight.
Also: the trick to rationing pizza? Buy Papa Johns. BUT ONLY WHEN THEY HAVE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE DEALS
i wish Good Burger was a real resturant :D the demo for Zero Escape had an easter egg of ya call one of the chicks on the phone she answers "Welcome to Good Burger,home of the Good Burger. May I take your order?" :D made me laugh my flank off
Fast food doesn't make you fast :P
no it doesnt
Lol
It makes you fat. Fat fatty fat fat with a side order of chub.

HoodyNinja: Props for stealth skills. Especially given your flab.
ASoftFluffyThing: that might be something for a second visit then. I think Ill stick with a cheeseburger, maybe with bacon and cajun fries like NullRadix said
There's nothing worng with being fat. You can be fat AND healthy as long as you didn't fat from eating too much of the wrong stuff.
Meanwhile: I can see my ribcage...

HoodyNinja: faaaaaat.

05,15Really? That's an odd measurement
/me shrugpony.

ASoftFluffyThing Depends on how tall you are. If you're a tall person, then you can stand to put on a little more weight. If you'r short, try and lose some pounds.
/me glomps SpeccyRush|Contestin
/me wonders how many people are actually watching the stream
05,15I am

HAKU ALSO SAID I WOULD DIE! I'M STILL HERE
SpeccyRush|Contestin: I really start to question how we get onto these conversations. :D
HoodyNinja, all you need to know is that Meanwhile would win the height contest between me and him.
/me leans on ASoftFluffyThing's head
See?
08,01fluttercry: your BMI is 15.2
Meanwhile: Pls, don't get SHORT with me! AHAHAHAHAHA
AJIsAwesome: we were talking about fast food. Which leads to fast food being bad. Which leads to weight
plz donr leave
HoodyNinja Yeah, you'll die. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but you'll die. All my plans all long term.
HoodyNinja: I'm 4'11"

08,01NullRadix: it's good for quick and dirty overviews

GhostHarmonie: It won't let you leave
I heard a ping
Hai everypony

Hi, DerpyMuffins. :)
hi DerpyMuffins
ello DerpyMuffins how much do you weigh?
ello DerpyMuffins
08,01hey DerpyMuffins
find out what happened
So many pings
... although usually when I hear about BMI being terrible its in the heavy direction, because of muscle mass...
evening DerpyMuffins
05,15Yeah everywhere I read says 5'8 should be somewhere in the 145-170 range, I fit into that
Who streaming?
Clearly the you should dig up the corpse.
DerpyMuffins: GhostHarmonie
Idc, I look good
Im so hungry now :|
And thats all that matters
08,01fluttercry: you said you were about 100?
Wait, how'd we get from food to height/weight?
I have no idea.
Where'd it go before that?
Haku
HoodyNinja: good, be proud og yourself
Thats how
ASoftFluffyThing: And from there was candy
*of
gota find it
fluttercry: that would mean I'm severly underweight at 120 5'8 so I don't like it
fluttercry: regardless, you might try exercising and putting just a little muscle on. Exercise is just good for you
oni_link: eat cereal? :3
thelonepony: oh yes :)
HoodyNinja, I came back from dishes to people talking about fast food
05,15as in 145-170
I'm underweight then
I'm 5'4, 108.
I'm overweight. Yay >>
ASoftFluffyThing: food > fast food > fast food is bad! > fast food makes you fat! > I'm not fat, I'm these dimensions!
Wait are we taking age into the equation?
I'm probably underweight, too. :D
Meanwhile: you said 109 before
08,01fluttercry: ah, i misread you
brb, gonna get cereal XD
NullRadix, that's about right.
SpeccyRush|Contestin: I did? Then that was a typo.
Age has nothing to do with weight unless hieght is ablso taken into effect
qhats the games name agian
5" 6 1/2 130lbs
Scratches.
also, apparently Meanwhile is like... skin and bones

SpadeMagnes[R]: How fast and how many times it takes, I think.
How do bosses work? I never understood how the look of the boss portrait worked
Rex_Mundi: Just chat, I think.
there are some boos that if you dont catch them at ur first try u wll never be able to do so

I dislike luigi
yeah
D:
i mean ping
weeping_pegasi82: luigi dislkes you
this game is already 8spooky10me
1) all the original recolors look the same as their original on both games. BUT... they start with level 5 and 2100 gold.
So if I always try to be good and not be evil what allignment ma I?
seems legit

yo
well nite everypony
Luigi needs more love :I
when i was 4, this game was lke playing silent hill for me :D
Lol, link still says spyro's kingdom
SpadeMagnes[R]: do you always want to be good, or do want a little leniency?
Night LunasGuard :)
the glow in the dark cynder looks the same, but it called 'Series 2 special" in game.
Why does luigi trust that he won a mansion he never entered a contest for?
NewSuperBronyU: I wub you for showing this
05,15SpadeMagnes[R] depends, do you follow the law, regardless of your personal feelings, or are you willing to bend the rules for the greater good?
NewSuperBronyU, why Totaka's song of course
Night, LunasGuard. :)

If something is considered good but in reality it isnt I do it my way
05,15JAAASON
This is one of those games where I played it through once and never touched it again. Fallout Newvegas on the other hand i have played countless times

What exactly is being talked about?
JAAAAAASOOOOON
MAAAAAAAAARIOOOOOOO
05,15SHAAAAUN
Im a neutral good but when pushed too far, I become chaotic evil -_-
SpadeMagnes[R]: You're probably neutral/true, then.
gotta love this game :D
2SPOOKY
ABORT
MARK!
It took me forever to relize Olimar's ship was a stealth joke
I never knew they repainted the models
I wub this game
nuetral, good, chaotic, Am I missing something?
when i was 4, this = silent hill :D
05,15Chaotic Good is the best because you do what YOU think is right, even if it means going against the law
i need to stop going to bed at 11
Jade FLashwing and Polar Whirlwind
fluttercry: morals over laws then?
I only have the first original skylanders stuff
DomoDomo: i go to bed at 12:30 - 1:30 lol
all the original series recolors were just a solid color.
Onion man!
Ah
fluttercry: What does neutral good mean?
05,15Chaotic Neutral is fun because then you're insane, willing to do whatever you want and only look out for yourself
I will probably get the sequal next month
DomoDomo: school starts at 6:30 :P
NewSuperBronyU, you do know about Totaka's song in this right?
Has anyone here listened to the translation for the pikmin song?
What is this Bed you speaketh of
cachi01: Oh wow xD;
yeah yeah, "We'll die for you" and shit
Its really morbid
but soem of the variations for the new skylanders game have a full paint job.
11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Don't think so :/
really
what the...
this game is short
and NewSuperBronyU did you tell everyone to refresh
and they actualyl look different in game from the originals.
05,15AJIsAwesome A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.
all I know is that you need to be on the control screen and wait for 3 or 4 minutes
fluttercry how does one determine what allignment they have? I would assume there are about 50k tests on the internet.
SpadeMagnes[R]: no.....n a scale of 1-10 how dark is it?
11,02SpeccyRush: Yesh
ooh look for the shadow of luigi hanging by a noose
11,02Make sure your embeds are on MIPS
NewSuperBronyU: Wait long enough in the options menu for the controller customization. Wait long enough, and you'll hear it.
[Alpha]: dat fucking easter egg......
NewSuperBronyU: you have to leave the game alone when you get to E.Gadd's lab when the control scheme pops up for about 3-5 minutes and the theme plays
cachi01: Well it goes on about stuff like the pikmin are willing to die for olimar even though he may be a jerk
SpadeMagnes[R]: soooo 4?
i bet the third one will have lightcore flashwing (chuckle)
11,02Well, for the sake of time, I'm not going to do it ><
NewSuperBronyU, just go on the control screen when you can
SpadeMagnes[R]: Well, they are thanking him since they wouldn't survive with out him.
and wait
Yup Nintendo has a weird sense of humor
Aw man, SB. :<
it's short
and a very fun easter egg
NewSuperBronyU: Yeah, its cool to do when you have time :P
therainbowvortex: ping
11,02If everypony here wants me to do it, I'll do it o.o
i swear, skylanders is the most hilarious example of on disc DLC ever created. :)
good morning everypony
DO IT! :3

Are you gonna do a complete playthrough NewSuperBronyU?
for a couple of minutes
05,15what's Tokata's Song?
Ohai somepony_else :3
cachi01: Tokata's song
fluttercry: Hidden melody in certain Nintendo games.
A morbid song about the pikmin
oooooh tokatas song :D
Go to the bathroom or something NewSuperBronyU
Totaka's
hi thelonepony
not tokata
Hi, somepony_else. :)

another fun trick. at least with the new portal, you can play with skylanders still in their single packs.
question. How do you stream off a wii?

Uprooted, we'll follow you alone.Today once again we'll carry, fight, multiply, and then be eaten.

nintendo...wut
So why is Tokata's song in several games?
I get it geez
Dug up, we'll meet again and be thrown around.But we'll follow you forever.
again
i'm dissapointed at the lack of new dragons, though. only one, and it's not a giant?
SpadeMagnes[R], because totaka
nintendo....wut
SpadeMagnes[R]: Just as an Easter egg.
What other games is it in?
05,15is this it?
SpadeMagnes[R]: its an easter egg that he puts into the games he made the music for
fluttercry: not yet.
not quite
So I think I turned my Brother into a Brony! Hes a mild one but he watches the show when I watch it on Netflix and he says his favorite pony is Fluttershy.
IMO "Standard" is best if you're starting out in the game. "Sidestep" is a bit difficult to get used to, but I find sucking up ghosts much easier with it.
Mmm smooth jazz
Now we should find Luigi Hanging Shadow
THIS
THIS IS IT
Yep I'd say this is it
Rex_Mundi: Hooray! :)
11,02DEPLOYING SMOOTH JAZZ

:D
Then we shall grove in the shade!

but then it gets too cold
*groove
so it makes another sun!
Is the professer an Ewok?
aww yeah de funk
This upcoming music is one of my favorties tracks in this game.
So do you get anything for catching all the ghosts?
the first one had a dragon for every element.
fireworks
in this section
SpadeMagnes[R]: DOn't think so.
Oh wait
and the praise of gadd
hello everybrony
You get fireworks. Nvm. :P
So how do boss ghost rankings work?
AJIsAwesome: me too
SpadeMagnes[R]: How fast you suck them up and if you get it in one go.
SpadeMagnes[R] if you're playing with friends, it's fun to make bets about who can catch the most ghosts in the shortest amount of time.
if the boss escapes anytime when they have more than 10 health, you lose the gold
SpadeMagnes[R]: efficiency
wow....who would say ai no uta was so depressing...
We'll fight, be silent, and follow you,But we won't ask you to love us.
SpadeMagnes[R] I made $7 by doing that :)
my girfriend is a spyr and dragon fan, so of course we have all of them, except for dark spyro (she doesn't have a 3ds)
so you need to pretty much one shot the ghosts to get a gold
^
Wooo
aww man no one said hi.......
well, at leasrt 91 of their health
hi flutterchu
without getting injured
05,15game boy horror
ohai flutterchu
05,15oh nintendo
Thats for the portraits...anything different for like the major bosses like Chauncy?
oh shit
them angel statues
best portable system
smack em up son
DONT BLINK
/me blinks
oh cool
So guys, I was wondering, is it easy to get into a group when you go to conventions, because unless I get my brother to go with me, id be going to summer bronycon by myself. And being with people is more fun than being with yourself.
and it's really silly to buy a game for a console you don't have just to get a skylander.
Luigi? You talk?
Rex_Mundi: not so easy
never been to a con :/
I bought my GBA when I was 10 just because there were Spyro games on it
^
Same with my DS
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah but all in text
Rex_Mundi: It's easy if you plan ahead. It really is more fun when you do go with people. :)
-.-
How hard are the other versions of the mansion?
Creepy dude is creepy
I now regret the waste of money
the original 3 are still the best.
i wish i went at bronycon :'(
SpadeMagnes[R]: like 20% harder
Its-a-toad
SpadeMagnes[R]: its not a rd joke
I agree
SpadeMagnes[R]: they are literally like 20% harder
Imo, both series are different
I haven't played the last two games
and the team decide dthey coudln't top themselves after year of the dragon, and bowed out.
So why does Mario not fuckign question this and some how luigi semi doesnt
i've always found the secret mansions to be easier
DotD or Skylanders
cachi01 really? I find no difference, but I have been playing it since the game came out.
enter the dragonfly was horrible. glithc city.
they did question it
Lunar_Brony: iirc one is mirrored
mario wentto investigate
I actually really liked ETD haha
and dissapeared
I might one day but it's not high on my priority list
Lunar_Brony: and same here
Man I love this game :3
luigi came to check up on mario
and there's one notable glitch in hero's tail.
cachi01 not really. Same ghosts, same rooms, same challenge.
Is it possible to get any mice you missed before the blackout when said event happens?
AJIsAwesome: I dont know anyother bronies. (except my brother kinda):(
and the weird thing was that there was absolutely no glitches that messed up the gameplay
/me hums along with the mansion theme
i think you can get the mice you missed in the blackout
SpadeMagnes[R]: Don't think so.
cade: consider yourself VERY lucky.
but amybe that's jsut blue ghosts
oh god, now the mansion theme is gonna be stuck in my head
SpadeMagnes[R] no. You have to get everything in the blackout or you miss stuff.
damn i wish i still had the strategy guide for this game
inb4 that creepy talking painting scene that made me shit my pants
Lunar_Brony: What I mean can you get stuff you missed before the black out happened during it
there's one collectible that if you leave the area after activating the platforms needed to reach it but before collecting it.
I got one glitch in ETD where the textures of everything disappeared
WHY IS THIS SCENE SO DISTURBING?
Everything just turned bright green
you lose the chance to get it until you start all over.
Buytoast you can get the 2 blue ghosts regardless of progress.
/me humms the ghostbuster theme
it was in the snowy area in hero's tail.
I got a glitch where the enemies in dragonfly dojo had their staffs/sticks/whatever stretch off into infinity haha
i know you can get the blue ones regardless and shit, i'm just saying you can probably reget em if you missed em during the blackout
SpadeMagnes[R] pretty sure, yeah.
the first legend of slyro gae was, well.... EASY.
did stream stop?
nope
yup
hm, stopped for me
What are the most dickish ghosts in this game?
and refreshing dont help
I thought it was hard. :<
you just need to refresh though
the only real challenge at all was te final boss, and the training sessions.
Buytoast yes you can, I got the one in the secret room after the blackout.
oh there it is, nvm
Speedy Spirits.
What about the ghosts you see who are doing no harm yet you suck them up anyways?
the second one, well... it was a lot harder.
I found it a nice touch that the portraits change design depending on rank
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
There were these one floating enemies or something that always gave me trouble
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
Never seen this game.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Either Speedy Spirits or the Banana eating ghosts, IMO.
And I couldn't figure out how to beat that train thing for the longest time
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
hmm.
well i got to go, night everyone :)
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
Bye, thelonepony. :)
And thanks for the stream SB :3
Goodnight thelonepony
Rex_Mundi depends on the room and ghost. You can light up the courtyard behind the mansion by sucking up all the "0"s
You're paralyzed
I always hated the big ones

You guys read the translated MLP doujins that was on bronystate? The neat thing that sets those things apart from regular fanzines is that they were actually sold at comiket conventions because Japans copyright laws are lax

now THAT'S how you catch a ghost
aww yeah

gotta love that broom :D
So how the fuck did the boos get caught in the first place?
Oh great, Luigi, you opened the gates of hell.

gadd
13if i shoot a ghost holding luigi
13do i get a second ship?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Corraled?
Yes Gadd we're just going to ignore the 70 or so ghosts we just fucking set loose
50
Logic. :P
13don't think anyone got it .-.
SpadeMagnes[R]: shigeru miyamoto is the mastermind behnd mario's dissapearance........ he blamed the boos and then he trapped them in there
I don't get Shizu's joke

AJIsAwesome|Weegee: Best dentist ever

I thought the first one actually was kinda hard
SpadeMagnes[R]: Sure is. :D
>happy
Shizuka, you had a reason to get mad. Im ashamed of forgetting ;A;
Shizuka: when i wrote NOW I GET IT i already had galaga in my tongue! but i jsut needed time to write it.........

/me smothers MahBoi777 withgs hu
Pinkies4thWall: I know! TT~TT
yeah same
*with hugs
Lunar_Brony: Mine was the baby. Freaked me out as a kid.
Man, this game was so easy as a kid...but I never beaten it until some years later...
I assume this is an SB stream?
Correct.
He was definitely very talkative though :P
ype
*yep
yeah
Pinkies4thWall: how have you been? :)
We're playing SuperBrony's Mansion.
Re-Deads from Ocarina were the scariest thing in a child hood game and then I stepped up to the remake of Resident Evil 1 ;A;
11,02:3
Nice catch!
^
MahBoi777: i won a Derpy vinyl figure last week, so great
ghost get!!!
definitely not a bad thing in a quiet place like this
Pinkies4thWall: Nice!
Imagine the Re-Deads in Zelda U...
11,021/2 of the game completed :D

...I WILL BE SOILED FOR LIFE!

SOILED IT! SOILED IT! SOILED IT! SOILED IT!
LOOOL
Pinkies4thWall: awesome!
11,0219 days \:3/
He kind of reminded me of this one guy from a while back who always gave me crap for not liking TloS
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 11 days, 9 hours, 29 minutes, 34 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
Just you wait until we hit Boolossus . . . oh sweet Celestia that is the most annoying boss in EXISTENCE.
WOOOT
NewSpookyBronyU: SEVEN DAYS
11,027? O3O

GAH, BOOLOSSUS. -_-
11,02bathroom break brb :3
19? Seven? 3? What's coming out that's not S3, again?
hahaha
Creepiest things about this game as a kid: The "NINTENDO" at the begining...and that was about it.
that guy was annoying
NewSpookyBronyU: inb4 Wii U release pushed back a couple months
11,02Saddest part of this game was sucking up the dog :(
Aight I'll just new tab and come back in a bit.
So. We have counters for Nightmare Night/Halloween, Season 3 premiere, and Wii U release date.
AC3 /)^3^(\ tomorrow~! :$
Oh, Wii U.
NewSpookyBronyU: the dog was FUCKING EVIL
and BronyState Movie Night . . . just cuz.
So, yeah...I always want to play the beta of the game...looks more promising than the existing product...with the clock and endings... (espectially the bad one...Dat Face...).
can you do anything with the cast in this game? or is it just for show?
Basically he thought I was his friend and always tried to talk to me but he would just end up telling me in some way that I'm wrong to not like them
*cash
dem millions
ALL DEM MILLIONS!
insert: You can look at their paintings in the gallery.
insert gives youa better ending
lol
*you a
pony64844 is best pony
It's probably in millions of yen. So it ends up being like ten dollars
well im off 2 bed cya everypony :)
Also, MahBoi777, I had lots of Sweet Apple Cider on saturday night
By the way SpookyBrony, if you stayed on the instruction screen for a few minutes, you'll get a secret tune...sorta like in Mario Paint.
Goodnight Sketch_Toku_Brony
Zaphod was nowhere near _that_ bad... but the whole "You're wrong, the game was easy" reminded me of that
Night, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)

I guess you're probably the only one here who's played Skylanders
wait dont even have a code to use....
twilight_sprinkle hmm, Scream Fortress - Year 3 reference?
So, I'm going Trick-or-treating this year
Lunar_Brony: dunno, never played tf
So yeah, in the beta, you got a clock and a meter showing how much ghosts you can stored up. If it reaches to 10, the vacumm will blows up.
But....thats sad :(
8need codes from trading card or coupons
*
I dont have either
twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
I'm going as a Wnderbolt
VenHur I was just reading a synopsis of the beta. Looks much more difficult to me.
it's kind of weird being this out of touch. I used to at least understand at least some of what people were talking about in the LoS days even if I hadn't played DotD
*Wonderbolt
but all that stuff he was saying I was just like "what are you talking about?"
Plants give money when watered? Well, shit, time to do some gardening!
Yeah that's exactly what I was thinking lol
:D
lol
And i'm guessing if you quicky finished the game, you'll get the perfect ending.
XaviortheSavior: :D
11,02You get a perfect ending by getting a ton of money
And the bad ending the other way around.
@NewSpookyBronyU He may be talking about the beta of this game. Not sure.
I am.
Pinkies4thWall nice! I'm dressing up this year just for the sake of "Everyone at school is doing it". I haven't decided wether or not I'll go trick-or-treating, though. I have a lil' sis, which is a reasonable excuse, but I can think of other ways to spend my evening.
goddamnit hub, y u show premiere 3 hours earlier than last years eps
7 in the morning here :/
ouch
Lunar_Brony eeyup
anyhing earlier than 2 pm is early for me though..
Lunar_Brony: it's nearly 7 in the afternoon here O-o
but then again I don't get Hub, so I'm forced to either watch it here or wait until it hits Youtube.
I guess skylanders is popular
I heard some people talking about it.
i dont even have a tv .-.
doesnt really interest me,.
Here's a screenshot of the bad ending in the beta. http://www.unseen64.net/wp-content/gallery/luigi-mansion/luigis14.jpg
I planned on getting a skylanders collection started
Sometimes, being Canadian is a pain in the ass.
VenHur: ...............
but you would not believe how far they have decided to go in merchandise
that, is a creepy picture
Lunar_Brony: i know eh
Lunar_Brony, yeah we only have treehouse.
Lunar_Brony: sorry couldnt resist xD
MLP doesn't belong on treehouse.
VenHur that is the most f*cked up thing I've seen in a long time.
yeah
They expanded to selling these plastic game sets
Wait, that ghost had a key!
for example
mario~
some skylanders castle you can set all you figures on
well everypony i have to go to work now
bye bye
Bye, Maid_RainBow :)
Skylanders bed sheets
seeya Maid_RainBow

bye Maid_RainBow
heh, wow
oh wow
Hat, Glove, Shoe, Letter, Star
Its not fuckin pokemon where they sell pokemon condoms...
I saw a whole bunch of Skylanders stuff at Target the other day
mornin' everypony
and yes they do sell them in Japan
we have the Hat, Glove, and Letter IIRC
hi SirGanjalf
O_o... wat
if only amu-chan was here...
haha
Hi, SirGanjalf. :)
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VBQyU_CFYY4/UI5wbgUxcNI/AAAAAAAA-yg/SmgQdbLuArM/s1600/1.jpg
hoi SirGanjalf
so skylanders, do you have to like put the character on the platform or something
In Japan you can buy pokemon condoms
how does it work
how did they intergrate the toys with the game
twilight_sprinkle that is a kick-ass pumpkin
/me is distracted by Ponyhoof
twilight_sprinkle: Nice!
Don't they sell condoms door to door in Japan?
but... why @___@
Because pokemon prints money
true dat\
The game comes with this portal thing and you put the figures on it
Buff Atlas
also this one is pretty well made http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UBxQ9PIzeRk/UI5wd0F94pI/AAAAAAAA-zA/Obmsr46Lqn4/s1600/5.jpg
I despise Buff Atlas
The figures are basically like memory cards
yeah
does it come with figures or do you have to buy them
but they're cross platform
which I know someones going to figure out how to do it without getting the figures
so each figure saves whatever you have done with it?
twilight_sprinkle: Wow. that's pretty good.
yes
cool
http://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4928196551509409&pid=15.1
this is a fact
lol
I can just imagine this ghost going "YEAH!!!"
Id like to try to reverse engineer it.
Im surprised this game hasnt been turned into a creepy pasta
I was thinking about getting the new pokemon game
bye everybrony
im sure theres some creepy pasta of this game if you look hard enouph
But I always end up getting bored of them
Isn't there something on the treadmill?
One day im going to buy a copy of pokemon blue for gameboy color.
I have one
AJIsAwesome|Weegee: but treadmills are scary
Let's see: what do you do to a PUNCHing bag?
http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=I.4684478649730667&pid=15.1
I like treadmills. ;~;
or maybe it's my brother's
I don't remember
I borrowed it from a friend for like 3 months when i was 8
XaviortheSavior: Hug it? :3
SB, punch the bag
not sure but I think you have to smack the punching back
it was awesome
I seen one creepypasta moment of the game...where his shadow gets hanged.
*bag
I never finished it
I like trains
i played it for hours.
My parents didn't let me play the games when it first came out
pokemon for the gb was awesome!
VenHur: Isn't that just a graphical glitch?
VenHur: Oh yeah that thing is weird, glitch or not
:O
I played it so much I bought the 20 hour battery pack for gameboy advanced.
yeah, it's just his shadow accidently elavated
NewSpookyBronyU, punch the bag
Then when I did get a copy, my save data got corrupted like 5 hours in and I just gave up
:(
So I was like "meh, new ones are better anyway"
http://imageshack.us/a/img4/9223/dscf0116us.jpg
so close...
DANG
he still got gold
For me, the hanging Luigi is a glitch...I suppose.
You wont believe how many years it took me to get all those
Probally got lefted out during the development process.
I was trying to win a copy of Emerald on ebay
http://imageshack.us/a/img204/386/pokemongbc.jpg
Since my Sapphire died
good evening everypony :)
2nd gbc pokemon version
NewSpookyBronyU: Check the treadmill?
Hi, kirzstryfe. :)
AH, so that's what that was.
O YEA
I opened it up to look at the supposed dead battery and lost the screw that was holding it together
Thought it was a secret treasure. :P
The problem with the old pokemon games is that the batterys will eventually fail
BO-OMB!
hi kirzstryfe
Ohai Capt Kirz
you can buy a gameboy save cartridge
PRINCE DARI I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU <3
barely got it.
NewSpookyBronyU run on the treadmill if you're smart.
it stores your game saves via flash memory, no batteries
Oh hi Kirzstryfe!
Mine said it was dead, but it still worked fine
wat?
So I'm not sure what happened
/me hugs dari
I backed up all my pokemon files with it
NewSpookyBronyU . . . oh shit, missed that. Nevermind! You already got the key.
ohai
I think one of the games has level 60+ pokemon
/me hugs eman
ohai
I was going to replace the battery just in case, but it was literally soldered in
that sucks
time for ice?
:D
I thought it was just a little button cell you could replace?
You feel like a badass playing the save lol
/me chops him in half, mid-air
I thought so to
oni_weegee eeyup
:D
but yeah, completely stuck
how have you been dari ^_^
11,02Oh fuuuu

Be careful with those dishes.
Brad_ http://imageshack.us/a/img193/8012/downloadgh.jpg
Not bad thanks, you?
well i dont play gameboy or nds stuff anymore
I think I took a picture and showed people here before actually
but when I did, flashcards were a must.
NOT THE CHEESE
...Oh...he forgot the cheese...
oh, didnt know you saw it
you can get flashcards these days for just a few dollars
...Welp, looks like he's gonna had to start the game ALL over again.
someone asked me why I even bought it
My college has all this really old stuff
YOU FORGOT THE CHEESE :[!
LIke these huge paper looking floppy disks that are bigger than most laptops
That's always fun, right?
Commodore 64!
Let the Mr. Freeze puns commence.

the satanic ritual can now begin

oh yeah, and another thing I dont like about the new skylanders giants is that EVERY DAMN RETAIL has to have their own exclusive crap to make you buy it from them.

And that is one of TWO gold diamonds in the game.
11,02Most valuable thing in the game
11,02Second one comes from getting all 50 Boos :)
Good.
11,02Though, it might only be worth 25,000,000, Can't remember...
11,02But it's the most valuable item in the game
/me reverts back to normal state
NewSpookyBronyU spin really fast and flick your torch off and on
Ah, now that's better.
One time, after I got all fifty boos, the gold diamond appeared outside the room i.e. in the wall; I could not pick it up :(
Polydunami: WHAT? :O
DId you reset it?
It was a long time ago however
I don't think I did
lol
I can't remember
this makes me laugh
Hm?
NewSpookyBronyU you can walk on the roof in this room
NewSpookyBronyU that dinning room
Oh yeah, that room
good to hear
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/16/9o_s4xRvx0C1Iid54xejRw2.jpg the first thing I though when I saw this was "what the hell is wrong with his back foot?"
wow
What's scary is that Luigi's voice gets weaker as his health depletes :S
He just looks like a pimp to me
And the music slows down
^
yeah pretty much
^^
I start to feel REALLY bad for Luigi when that happens.
me too
I feel bad when my character dies :
:I
Well....
I never did get a game over in this game; I was scared to, so I would shut the game off before I died :$
FUS RO yay
Its late but maybe its best that I do it now, I wanted to make a quick announcement
inb4 boss
Also, this boss.
k
aww yeah this boss was cool
This goddamn boss was a pain in the ass when I was a kid :|
^
unicorn
aw ok
fuck hes high
All those boos
NewSpookyBronyU dont die
Boing boing boing
NewSpookyBronyU dont die again
ill post it on the main topic before i go, incase anyone wonders what happened
NewSpookyBronyU dont die again and again
use the power of the pony to defeat the boss!
I'll let everyone know as well
thanks
np
I don't want to get too far into the details, ill just say its family stuff
Polydunami: I felt REALLY bad for him. Basically, the screen cuts to black and it says "Good Night......"
ok
Oh wow
Also, you see Luigi pass out.
Well, the power of Youtube might help here.
I should probably go to bed now
k
What's funny about this fight, in the PAL versions you ride on the vacuum during this.
See you Cades :)
guess its just you and me now Amu-chan
AJIsAwesome: really?? D:
Yep.
Saw a video of the PAL version.
That is very possible. XP
oh yeah AJIsAwesome im looking at it now, they had a better , harder version
good morning everypony ^_^
Hi, NocturnalBlade! :)
And the second quest was much more extensively changed, I hear
The entire game was mirrored
oh wow
why did they change it? I hate when NA gets shafted :I
*shrugs*
11,02Dat Alicorn
indeed SB
It reminds me of the international version of Paper Mario: TTYD.
Nice
Also, the internation version of FFX?
Especially Vivian, to be precise.
YES!
So Vivian was actually a crossdressing male in the Japanese version?
AJIsAwesome: Oh yeah, I saw that on Did You Know Gaming
I HATE THIS BOSS!
Polydunami: Yep.
I get the feeling this is just a joke in the game :S
Vivian wanted to be a girl, but she's a he.
Goodnight, Shizu
Well, she got her wish in the NA version :3
11,02Night Shizuschlafen :)
nite Shizuschlafen
11,02That boss battle got me 15 Boos :D
:D
also, youre supposed to refer to trans-gender individuals as the sex they are portraying. so that might have got lost in translation. Also NOA is like, kids wont get it but we wont risk it :I
11,02Here, we go, final area.
Gah, I guess I'll stay for the finale. :D
yay~
I was going to sleep, but since you're near the end I'll stay. :D

Yeah, I was going with the regional gender there :P

11,02That's weird...where's the second Gold Diamond?

OH NO
Don't tell me
11,02Oh fuuuu
11,02I have to go back up
didnt you miss a rat?
IT DIDN'T SAVE IT?
11,02I saved before collecting the diamond .-.
wow

00,10place needs an elevater
11,02for the love...
CRYSTAL MOUNTAIN PONY CON, Y U NO HAPPEN SOONER?!?
NewSpookyBronyU: you got the pool player ghost right?, don't remember you getting him
SpeccyRush: he did
11,02I got him
SpeccyRush: yes he did I was there
kk
i wonder if they sell actual gameboy horrors....
11,02omg...
what?
11,02. Note that if Luigi loses all of his HP, or if the player exits the game after collecting the second Gold Diamond from the 50th Boo before they saved after collecting the diamond, it will disappear from Luigi's inventory and from the room the green-hatted plumber collected it from and it will never come back or recover, therefore, the player will either have to delete the file to
11,2start over or finish the game anyways so that they get another chance.
Oh

He's humming with the background music. Hmm
So you can't finis hthe game now then, or what?
Love the background
You can, but you just don't get the 2nd diamond.
What difference does that actually make?
Ahh

08,01and haaaard
08,01and it's easier to write things down, because you can just use backspace when you fuck up
The voice sounds kind of like DeLancie... Or am I crazy?
Klumzeedragon: It is
Ha. xD
08,01Klumzeedragon: no, we've implanted a chip in your head that makes everyone sound like JdL
eLLO THERE GUZS.

Ello there guys...
Ello Malavolent!
08,01i keep having dreams abotu him...
Hehehe, oh my
08,01it's because we're sorting out guests for the con again now
08,01we're inviting him, some of the other VAs, some crew, and... well, i can't tlak about the rest of that yet
/me 08,01is all mysterious-like
O-o
08,01also, my custom Chrysalis is pretty
08,01her mane is just wonderful
Will we get to see her?
So, what you're saying is, you really like her mane?
he's got a sticker that says " hello my name is: ike"
That is one classy yet ugly cat.

This is making me want this game more now

<3 the book textures
Phase4: Don't play this game for the humour, the gameplay and the mechanics, we have epic book textures!
^
Dont like puns Sumi?
Makes sense. xD I can respect that.
this game lacked a bit of gameplay polish
Are you sure thats safe?
Klumzeedragon: /slap
Klumzeedragon, oh you XD
but to be fair, i say it lacks polish while comparing it to portal 1/2
<_< Don't know what you're talking about.
and nowyou're a cat

Oh, guess not
Hehe
That item spitter pretty much sums the nature of this puzzle

who's this?
What's up in here?
Take the trampoline thing yourself?
Stuff.
CrimsonPhoenix: It's Sumica playing Quantum Conandrum
Ooh~~
Hai everypony
Hey DerpyMuffins. :)
hey guys i love to stay up with yall a little more but i got to hit to bed anyways but i will talk to you guys in the morning ok............peace everypony.
Night Moopy!
You called?

needs more pun
I agree. xD
And then Ike was mashed up
Science ball :D
Science Ball!
SCIENCE BALL
indeed it does
Science ball is best ball
!!SCIENCE!! ball!
08,01ooo
08,01what is this?
Toilet
08,01is this that game that's like A 3D Eversion?
i have no idea what that is
this is like aperture science if it existed in the tf2 universe.
08,01sumipone!
well eversion is at specific points
adasdad, if it was in tf2 there'd be more mercinarys
i canne spel
Though Inversion was laaaaaaame. xD
mercenaries
.-.
gee, whatever gives you that feeling sumi
08,01this looks very much like a more colourful Portal
Most reviews said it was a lot like it which was a bad thing
D:, switch is not being pulled
this cannot be allowed to pass
WHAT PERPUSE DOES THAT SERE?!?
ded
08,01the design of the game doesn't really have the same... completeness as Portal
yeah, it has these ledges
Completeness is Valve's speciality
thats my only complaint really, really good game
08,01the hell kind of factory is this?
and its hardly fair to compare stuff to portal
Valve know how to do 5 things brilliantly: Completeness, polish, trolling references and most of all: Impress the crowd
ONe of their designers said something amazing
"If we do our job right, noone will notice it"
XD
08,01it looks like the sort of house Peewee Herman would have in Hell
safe is sentient
HE IS DISCORD
RUN
I know exactly what you mean Sumi. :D
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
08,01hell, even the music is similar
woo
08,01but not as awesome
Portal2 music was written byy Mike Morasky I think
Valve do a good job on their music
one of my favourite guitarists ever
08,01pony portal is best crossover
you do
"fumwer"

i like how these lasers are powered while the generators are off
Phase4: Anti theft, innit?
anti-lifeform
lol
um
yeah this game doesnt have fallback
oh wait
thats new
gotta change to fluffy when it hits the bottom not after
08,01Phase4: have you signed up for the Steam Linux beta?
Sumica, switch when its at the bottom
Sumica: make if fluffy when it already goes up again
hey :(

love the dog portriats

then I will be safe in the shade?
:)
Sumica: weegee

08,01requires windows
08,01or at least, Wine
o u linux guys
yeah, the time slow is awesome
its a bugger to do but this section is visually awesome
Dooooo eet
Go go go
you have to, its the way foward
you could fail misserably?
08,01dat fields joke
that bit was in the trailer, its what sold me on the game
its like "stuff you physics, i'm going over there"
is chat dead or is mine just not working?
ded
Just ded
She's slaow
O hi adam
Ordinalthrone: Totally ded.
Hello Vivix
Just been busy for a while
I love this game
got it with the DLC's and TF2 stuff
you can just jump across
Morning all
Ordinalthrone: What hats do you get?
the jump mechanics are a bit bleh
Hello Brenna_Hooves
slightly different to anything else and you can jump absurdly far
Hullur
'dat outhouse
sexy outhouse
:D
I'll have to see if my computer can run this game. :D Looks so fun.
Hello Brenna_Hooves
clock is ticking
Klumzeedragon: 2 gig 512 mb card and 1.something gigahurtz dual core
Klumzeedragon, there's a demo of it on Steam.
You need that basiclly to run it
So, I got a cosplay wig and as a joke I set my FB picture to me wearing it and everyone thinks I actually cut my hair

hahaha
ITS BOXMAN
Alright, I'll check it out guys. :) But I probably need a better graphix xard to run it.
that double x
Klumzeedragon: What do you have?
what is this game?
Quantum Conundrum
okai
damn. misses the introduction of a new dimension
brought to you by kim swift
director of portal
Serenity: standard one with my motherboard. So, nothing good. :D
Klumzeedragon: It's an onboard chip?
Aye.
Definately won't run it. You need 512 mb dedicated I beleive
dont forget to breath!
08,01i wish JdL was my mad scientist uncle
mooo?
Did I hear NewSpookyBronyU|Zzz?
08,01i have 1GB graphics memory on my laptop
Yeah, it's on my to buy list. But I need the cash first. :D Luckily I have a job now.
hmmm, i'm thinking of swappign my laptops optical drive for a hdd
2g-gddr5
BOX
Sumi: Yup, named Everyday I'm Shovelin.
08,01Serenity: well whoopty doo, mr. richpants
Klumzeedragon: this game can run on pretty much anything if you set the graphics low enough...
08,01with your fancy, dancy computer
now laser beams are fun
Besides, I was victim to El shitbox
08,01Serenity: mine was half that
So I deserved a good one
08,01well, just over half that
08,01dell vostro 3700
08,01protip: never buy a dell vostro
My dads was 2000, all the way from 2006
Hehe
08,01they're spec'd quite well, but the stuff that isn't spec'd is TERRIBLE
I've got an Acer something, dunno the specs
08,01like the keyboard, trackpad, sound, screen, etc.
Ooh-
08,01this thing is falling apart after only 2 years
Ordinalthrone: True. But I want a decent card so I can play some other games as well. I got Deus Ex cause it was like $5 on sale, so I want to be able to play that at least with decent graphics.
Is anyone else going to school today?
No
:P
Klumzeedragon: At least you can play this
If you're not on a laptop, graphics are super cheap nowadays
08,01Brenna_Hooves: i was meant to be, but the car i was getting a lift in broke
Vivix: Only 100 quid for a 1 gig dedicated card
yes, but not only that
08,01i remember when a GeForce 3 was £400
thanks to current situations, games aren't pushing it
when I bought a GTX670, and didn't notice a difference
at--all, really, maybe I will with new games coming out
brb
i hated this level because swithcing batteries was weird... you had to walk away from it...
I might buy some more RAM
Vivix: True, but everying is expensive when I have $10 in the bank and $8 in my wallet. :P
I only have 12gig
true Klumzeedragon --very true
i suck at spelling... :P
hey everypony, what am i watching and who's playing it?
I've got 16
opted not to buy 32 cause--I only need 16
Flyboy: Quantum conundrum
08,01i've only got 8
Funnily enough, the best part in my PC is the processor
I got the super super top end i7
same here, my MOBO supports 64. but why?
I would have been fine with 8 I think-
but on 4 Cubase would stutter
I've got 2600 i7 3.4ghz
didn't want 2600K- since Overclocking is something I never do
Mine's a 6 core i7
back
I forget thr model
I'll look in a mo
Didn't want six core either-
am i the only one still on a dual core?
but I bought this before six was ou I think-
I had a p4 3.2 before I bouht the i7, so I feel ya dark
my macbook pro is a dual.
My mom made homemade bread...... In the middle of the night
macbooks dont count
my PC is a 3930k 6 core
:I
the_real_pony_1604: But that's a macbook, so yeah
Since macs are the abbreviation of. Le shit, dual core is what you'd expect
Everyone keeps telling me to get a mac for audio
macbooks dont have the right to be brought up in discussions about PCs
Vivix: I built my comp from scratch, but I don't know what in it exactly. :D When I get a graphics card, I'll have to take note of everything.
Macs are okay
i have got a 3.5 GHZ core 2 quad 4GB ram and a GTX670
but I wasn't--comfortable, and it kept braking on me
I hate macs with all my guts
Klumzeedragon, hehe yeah, it's easy to forget, I only remember since I did it recently
I don't, macs are fine, but I do think they're overpriced and kinda bad
Lets say, if you think how much Meanwhile hates Trixie, I can compare that to my hate over macs
hey sumica it would be more conveniant to have these safe on the other side of the lazer
it's linda like saying "i have a donkey" in a discussion about cars
Hehe
magi9c
magic*
this is probably the hardest level i did... :P
I only bought this one because we have a bunch of macs at work and I needded to know my way around them. and the laptops are built a heck of a lot better than PC laptops
Hmm, there are other windows that can be broken
Sumica just throw them to the other side ?
well you got that crate on the other side of the window
call upon the sea ponies, they can help you!
Hello everypony!
We used Macs in school, so yeah I had to get to know them too- but Ijust can't bring myself to buy one
I WENT AWAY FOR A SECOND AND JUST HEARD "yay~!"
even for audio-visual, I prefer computers
but my real computer is my PC that I built not long ago
wait... that sounded so much like discord...
Atm, I'm saving up for a falcon laptop
Flyboy: Same VA
if I could build my own laptop I would
Laptops are bastards to build
but since I would never buy a gaming laptop, it doesn't matter
Serenity: YAY!
WOO Keytar
the_real_pony_1604, well, your PC CPU sounded crazy badass
a guy at work has one
Now I just imagined Discord rocking out with a keytar
laptops for gaming are a lie anyway, no matter if apple or not
hey guys a
Sumica: He's basically calling us a wippersnapper
Dark_Horst: Mac gaming, GAHAHAHAHA
I like laptops for typing (if good keyboard) and surfing
that's--it
Hey alexxm
oh the game where john de lancie is your uncle
anyone gonna explain what the point of this game is?
I HATE island keyboards
how are things Socks
my asus here has some impressiv ehardware ont he paper
THIS ONE
OH GAWD
Henry to the 8th power?
http://friskymongoose.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Keytar1.jpg -- what a keytar is
Hated this puzzle
Vivix, PC is a 3930k, Rampage exteme iv, 16gig ram
but i have the suspicion the fan is by far too weak to cool all that
HINT HINT
Nice
main problems with laptops. cooling
Sumica: keytars are those guitars with piano keys on the side
Yeah laptops yeah- tend to get hot
Technically it's the opposite
alexxm: Not so good seeing as I'm a long way away from the nearest free internet conection :D
Dark_Horst: Easily resolved with a cooling pad
inm the main menu go to the DO A THING screen
it will freak you out worse
Keytars are a keyboard on a strap, with the mod-wheel and shit on the handle
Sumica: IKE has seen things
Cooling pad we used kept breaking
Vivix: Then it's shite
so we bouht a stationary for my sister, cause'fukdat'yo
Get a different one
whats this game called all i know is that john de lancie is your uncle
Nah
Don't want to game on laptop
Serenity: i think i'll have to buy a stronger fan first
and she's got a proper computer now, so she don't need it either
alexxm, Quantum Conundrum
One with at least 5k RPM should work
thanks Kandarihu
http://s3.vidimg.popscreen.com/original/4/cXV0c2FKdlBGRmsx_o_quantum-conundrum-ike-do-a-thing---1-hour.jpg but bigger and better
Serenity: if i find the guy who designed this thing, i'll beat him to death with it. high performance hardware and then a fan with the uppermost goal of being silent. there's barely any air coming out of the damn thing, no matter what i do
Ordinalthrone: I don't like the hypnotoad joke :D
which is probably the reason this thing is way slower than it should be
Mine's got ok fans, but- I dunno, yeah, it would get way too hot if I put any games on it
or so I'd bet
My PC's fans are gigantifucking huge
I bought it because it had a numpad
yay numpad <3
on computer I have Razer keyboard- kinda hate it
Vivix: My keyboard is a logitech g15
Yeah, I heard good things about those-
Also, never get island keyboards unless you're wierd
I kinda want a early 90s ibm keyboard
an*
got a nice quadcore in here. with booster tech. can get up to 3.2gigs if needed. in theory at least. in reality, it barely goes above 50% of capacity
http://www.dansdata.com/images/clicky/ballboard1024.jpg I had a keyboard like this, kinda
loved it-
Woah, it even has a trackpad
yeah- mine didn't
but it was that spring-mechanic thing
i remmmebr my logitech g11. nice keyboard, nice price,not too fancy, good for gaming. then it broke after logitech stopped producing them
that was a sad day
I think Razer has made a mechanical keyboard now- so I might try it if they let me get PS/2. Their ghosting is just so horrible
Aww
Dark_Horst: Mine's survived for 5 years
the replacement keyboard in the same price class is a blocky motherfucker
Serenity: yeah. i spilled soda over it :|
Ooh
My old IBM one had like vents under
so liquid would run through-
Only area that shows wear is the bottom, where some of the paint has worn away
it survived anything- even getting dropped repeatedly
but I broek the space-bar in two, so now it's on a shelf
all by myself... dont wanna be...
Only problem with the G15 is size, and it only has USB1.0 on it
I don't want usb at all anymore-
yeah. playing catch with yourself...
I don't need APM, but I like to type a lot, and ghosting is actually bothersome-
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #483
My typing is just fine
so who is streaming?
I even speak fully in texts D:
i c wat u did thar
:p
lol ikr
so not and so forth usually fails
if I'm typing like a madman-
that might be bothersome
It is, so I kinda want ps/2, or at least a proper usb keyboard
Thought he said Butt Bots for a second.
bai guys

http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-blackwidow-2013/
someone mentioned this to me-
Not a big fan of razer
I'm noot really a gamer, but I still prefer this kind of keyboard, I guess-, something solid and well made
/me Throw himself into the chat
I'm not really either, but I love the mouse I have from them
Ahh, there's 47 ponies bombarding
after I broke it in and it stopped double clicking on its own
/me screeches
i like how they describe their product like rocket science
dam it NewSpookyBronyU|Zzz
Hehe
who is streaming this!?
I see something I don't like already on that razer-
it was fun when optical mouses were still new
return key, and spacing between function keys
Flyboy: sumica is
Good morning
Dark_Horst: thanks
I use an IR mouse, I think
haven't had a mousepad in over 10 years
Ponies47 mornin~
mousemat*
mousemat?
never heard that word before
USE SLOWMO
run past
what's it called- the thing you have under your mouse
Sumica: I noticed the lasers take time to fire, why not slowmo and run past them
even when I had a ball-roll mouse I didn't use one-
Vivix: Mousepad
Mousepad.
xD
Ooh
Musematte we say
Ah Ball mouse-
Every week I had to pop you open and clean you-
laaaaame
Maybe those aren't smartphones he's surrounded by.
i remmber my old computer table. the coloration and wood pattern always gave my optical mouse trouble
My old mouse would only work on fabric
wellp. after chucking in the sponge i'm going to g osleep. nighty everypony
Aah yeah
So I bought a new one and it works on glass ;]
Nini taoumi
Night taoumi
Nighty night taoumi
yeah, I've got an IR now, wired
Mine's wireless
bye taoumi
I was always adverse to getting wireless
now i have a glass table. try using optical mosues on glass
and like 2005, wireless was all the rage, so we looked EVERYWHERE
so hard to find
Dark_Horst: There's a few now that work on glass
mine should work on glass
Mine for example
Vivix, Oh those controller we could have
but I never tried
FREE of tangled wires when picking up the thing
Hehe
but now you have no more battery left
Well, wireless controllers are nice
batteries**
but yeah, I was always against wireless keyboard and mouse, because of batteries
Sumica: i think you have to use the last one fired on the pad, and use the rest for platforms to get up to the door.
Vivix: Wireless keyboards are always a no
Bleh. I think it's time for bed. = w=
But wireless mice last quite a while
They do, but I've never had one, so I don't really want one
/me Throws Klumzeedragon into bed "Sleep well" :3
I want ah--a mouse with a cloth-cable though, soo smooth
Sleep well Klumzeedragon~~
yeah. my old one broke. bought a logitech g400 then. that one can deal with glass
surprised me when i found that out
Ah advances in mice
Well that's enough homework for tonight >.>
Thanks~ :) Night everypony. Thanks for the steam Sumica!
Time to watch stream
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
bye Klumzeedragon
it it should be on it should be on
Oh bye Klumzeedragon
Go back to work on homework AdamTheDuck :P
I thought Klumzeedragon was saying bye to Sumi because he stopped streaming XD
hehe
john de lancie is amazing :)
he also reminds me of bill miles, out of assassins creed revelations.
wait a sec, gotta check tome VA's
some*
YES
Games = good work for VA's
Random question for everypony: Who has actually used paintchat in like....ages?
I KNEW IT. John de Lancie played bill miles too!
what is paintchat
I loooove paintchat, but it was so buggyfor a while the regulars stopped showing up -
i still don't understand what paintchat is
Paintchat on bronystate is where we can hang out, chat, and draw stuff
well i cant draw :/
I miss our little group
I've never actually used it
hopefully it will reblossom on season start
I've used it quite a bit
and am working on a JS html5 version- just cause Paintchats are closing here and there cause--weird
I presume the reg room will be back up on Episode week?
Sumica: try throwing it a bit lower form the high ground
I know how batshit this chat gets
from*
It is up now, but the regulars aren't there
in paintchat that is
so many typo's today 0.0
bronystateregulars room I don't go to
aw horseapples...
Sumica: red dead redemption and gta 4 physics, no more needs to be said.
But yeah, now adays Paintchat is pretty empty, so- I tend to go to mangamaster's one instead
Not in paintchat, but I meant IRC
Yeah I've never been in bronystateregulars, so wasn't talking about that
Suprised actually, mane chat gets CRAZY at new episode weekends
I don't chat on episode showings
I usually enter or active on chat after the second showing of the episode
cant you out half the fluffy sofa on the wall it would stick?
*out = put
ya
but higher?
When do episodes broadcast for the first time?
I'm a euro, so I have no idea
!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 11 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes, 46 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
depends
Maths \:3/
for me it's 19:00
depending on daylights savins--
Actually it's 1800 for me- I think
1500 hours, is that murican time?
Yay, 02:00 for me on a cool, lovely Sunday morning
kobayashi maru scenario think outside the box :)
Sumica: you vould try and stack them?
So I'm something like 7 or 8 hours ahead
well 3 hours form now is when?
16:00gmt for me I think
25 past 2
nono
oooh...
3 hours and 35 minutes
cant you put the fluffy sofa higher but where you can jump on it?
just get the chair facing toward you so its like a midair staircase
Sumica: how about trowing an object from the shelf back there, then slow time, go upstairs and jump on it, have you tried that?
Why does Steam have to keep validating my TF2 all the time?
steam is odd
I guess is--all
toss it from up there?
it keeps doing first time installs to me
sumica remember what you did with the 4 fluffy safes in the previous room?
:)
ya
but use half the sofa
take the fluffy sofa
put half of it on the corner but .. up
ahh
no tthere
I am freezing
Britain, y u cold
don't think so
you know that corner where you tried to climb, will the sofa stick to THAT wall?
or that
there ya go
contemplating skipping work today...>_>
wow...
John De Lance?
Sounds like him
its him

that's not a good thing
Sounds fine to me >_>
house moved

rest of block didn't = fondation not right
To be honest I did try to puch it back onto the foundation lol the owner was like "I dont think that going to work" he was LOLZ

what are you taking up alexxm?

Hai VenHur :)
VenHur just an rp in another room
Oh, that...huh.
Dken2021 i'm doing media btec
oh that's cool
Im going to be a sad pony when I come home after my cruise
how come?
Yo!
Well I come home on the 10th
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Anime Opening: Deadman Ponyland
allo monstamuffin
And I intended to watch the s3 premire....so I will have to watch a rerun when ever that is
oh, I see
Yo Dken2021
Oh GTS I see you are full of bullshit as always
it's always been like that
They really need to take care of that level 9 or under legendary bullshit
Also one time when I searched for a reshiram a executor showed up....for some reason
I think it's because they were hacked or something
Apperently he nicknamed the pokemon Reshiram to get by the searching or something?
Also I wish the GTS gave me a list of all the options instead of a select few...but anyway hows everyone doing
things are well
any word from the folks in NY/Jersey?
oh dear is right
jesus
*a
lil bit spade
I dont mean to laugh but for some reason the photoshopped sandy head makes me chuckle
Shizuka: Fucking spiders...
/me Yawns
Also I facepalmed so hard when I caught my Regirock and Registeel in my Black 2
Hello, everyone
I spammed several dusk balls and ultra balls to no avail...guess what caught regirock
a pokeball?
A single pokeball, not even a critical capture
I caught steel with a premere ball
I once caught groudon with a diveball
Also I have no idea what to use my two master balls on
Black/White 2 has no roaming legends
SpadeMagnes[School]: as an FYI, the reason you see nonsense up on the GTS is because there are ways to trick the game into thinking your computer is the GTS, and downloading whatever pokemon you want to your game
what about thunderus and tornadus?
They arent in the sequel
I think
oh
Even Cresellia is in it
And she's a stationary one
For some reason Black and White and the sequel are the only pokemon games where I actually like the rival
probably because they had more character than may/brendan and maybe barry
And the fact they arent total assholes
Man watching these old videos reminds me how short videos on youtube used to be...
I take it Superbrony finished Luigi's Mansion last night
I guess
good evening bronystate :)
evening daring
not much activity in the room?
slow as usual
Gotta go fast
how are things DaringDerpy
11,01Everyone's at work or school. May pick up temporarily for lunch if people can get IRC from work or school.
I just got home.
hi all.
sup Alchemist how was work
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuABhumm6fY Perfect Intermission music here
13so according to my diary this is officially my one year anniversary of coming to bronystate
hi alexxm! I wasnt working today. I had to attend a site visit and it was freaking boring.
Happy Anniversary Shizuka :P
To be honest I never watched Jeopardy that much
good good, alexxm|foal :)
13i'm not sure how that much time passed
and for you?
Happy Anniversary Shizuka
Shizuka: Wait, you've not been here as long as me? :O
Shizuka: one day at a time, blending into one week at a time
I woulda thought you was here since the start.
13heavens no
when it hits november, it would be a whole year since i've been here
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhZr2IJbeys
Ponies!!
Cows!
Panda!!
13i am ill prepared for today because i am not a fan of spooky games..
O_o
I wonder if Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald will ever get remakes
The history doesn't mention when Shizuka joined. Maybe she was the "third wave of mods" who came in after Season 2 (SB, Wrek, Val, and Sumi came in at the start of Season 2)
think that depends if Gamefreak wants to make more money, which they will....
is thee a stream right now
13i was modded in january
there*
Shizuka: I know when you was a tech for a while
Pondooo
And I mean a long time
I would like if they tried to make more games like black and white 2 instead of just a 3rd game that adds stuff to the old ones like platinum to diamond and pearl
SpadeMagnes[School] oh yea, know what you mean, definately should
Personally maybe you guys should eventually update the History page to mention when GigaBit and Allegr0 came along and started doing PPP
It took what made the first fun and added entirely new content that was fun to play
Shizuka: Happy anniversary :)
13also um...
13http://fav.me/d5j8bda that first comment
13mfw
O_o
What the heck?
Luna Eclipsed is on soon. Is it going to be streamed here?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uurupmBurBM&feature=relmfu
don't think so since it's a weekday pony_5583
Ah. Okay then.
ah that suck, at least you're safe aren't ya?
I'm now in a hotel
We talking about sandy?
yes ponkie we are
I can't beleive how high the hudson was.
13hm, chance of rain on saturday
13guess it'll take that long for sandy to push something over here
13course knowing minnesota november they'll revise that high temperature lower and lower until it turns out snow on saturday
I live up north so I dont how to contribute to this conversation
13great white north eh?
13cooooooo lookookoo koolookookooooo!
If you would call Wisconsin that then I guess
A lot of people in NH lost power. Luckily I only lost it for 5 seconds.
13i am only next door spade :3

I was watching tv and the ad for the MLP royal weding playset was on!
Bleh Denmark has been getting rain again despite getting enough of it this summer. I just wish for the snow and cold to come and hope it stays
Shizuka: How is that running so well?
Hey Shizuka
Do you have a supercomputer or something?
Serenity Not really needed i can run it okay on my PC
Mines at the decent area
killerpony7733: You don't understand the joke :P
hoi shizuka, need to fix the screen, just saying :)
In it's day, you needed a supercomputer to max this
Serenity Meh but true. It was something for what it was at when it was released

LLAMAS.
Still need to finish crysis warhead but be damned it's bugged on the save i had around the last mission or so where it generates all visible see through objects so it's impossible to play
Crysis is 2007, most hardware can do it fine now
All settings maxed and its still tearing on asuka
Watt......
I heard Crysis 2 is much much more optimized
i didn't even know there was a crysis 2
