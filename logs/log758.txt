11,02I'll stream some more later tonight~
:3
did I quit, no
XD
i'll be back, i'm streaming now.. they inspired me.
Is anyone as disappointed by yesterday's episode as I am?
Alma, I LOVED it
It's going to be awesome, though
Just teleport
This is THE, Worst, Possible, Thing!
Alma, you look too much into it
there was no fan-service
08,01CrystalPhoenix: Sontronics STC-2S is good for large areas
08,01and reasonably cheap
pms are pms for a reason
its not right to then take them and post to everyone
I hate linecons. It's hard to avoid, though.
11,02Change in plans, going to keep streaming~
no he didnt, you insulted him first
Especially for autographs. The math is hard to make work out nicely.
@JJ you have been to many cons this year. Don't you think you might overdo it with being at every single one of them? xD
woo
Alma, that wasn't fan-service
No, of course not
just a tip don´t go to sweden during winter. It´s just cold and rainy
Alma: and hooffingers
lol
that was unexpected :$
hmmm maby
lol... YES. They can not make jokes anymore
Say 1000 people want autographs, and each autograph takes only 45 seconds (barely enough time to say hi). That's over 22 hours of autograph time.
Really sucks. :/
but seriously there was no fan-pandering
No, of course there wasn't
wait wait
Alma, don't get sacarstic in my face
this has been a fun day
idk why but the whole episode had a Rayman Origins vibe to me :D
be back got to end loop
Alma, only time you do that is when a debate goes in circle
http://poni.tylian.net/_images/f01dad8915d4d53142f8eb259e1ecbaa/327%20-%20discord%20gif%20popcorn.gif
Probably!
XP
Is the stream at another place now?
ok back
Discorbleh. Lol.
refresh it
its at http://events.yoursiblings.org/
can you not see it?
damn that was actually a pretty good drawing
try refreshing the page
That's not a debate
we changed a few things because of technicalm difficulties. just refresh the page if you can't see the streams
Working now?
11,02Updates are COOL
>Alex: I prepare the mulled wine for it
Goodnight guys
:D
Sui soesn't seem to stream anymore. Oo
The wiiupdates

nice one perry xD
W00t!
/me applauds
Faglestia :>
This might stand somewhere but anyway:When is Galacon?
Well, she still has 45 min.
Alma: That's exactly the reason I liked this episode - they are trying to appeal older fans... I can't see anything bad about that...
Aug. 3rd + 4th
I may die from how much I just drank
That Songggg!!!
I only see two of the streams
only 2 are on right now
08,01my boyfriend is a professional photographer, took this with his phone: http://instagram.com/p/SA9RYcIjsq/
I agree
Alma I can't agree with you on that, the episode was pretty solid and there was quite a lot of content to discuss about
5 Euro Donation!
for you it's like the episode is only 10 seconds
that pic is great
There. I just donated.
Alma, yeah you are stretching things
Yes, every bit counts
It looks more like Sibsy style
and SHE did the storyboards
lol the part where the first one got zapped reminded me of Rayman when ya get bubblized :D
you know i'm not quite sure if bans apply to this room as well
yeah anyway i deserved it :)
i was reminded of finding nemo with all the pinkies going fun
I was too
mine mine mine
:O
"Bet you can't make a face crazier than this"
YEAH
Gotta go fast
Alma, and before you mention it, no the Pinkie watching paint dry isn't a shout-out to that fanfiction, it didn't felt force and it did make sense
hello
Just to remind you, you can still bid on an Autographed Taralicious Emblem by ShikariSpeeder for the duration of this stream over at http://derpy.me/QwztP

Gee, hating for the sake of hating? That's too much hate.
i think it stopped with the discontinuing of the Gamecube
"Please note that purchasing the kinect 2.0 guarantees you a place in hell."
Purchasing the Kinect 2.0? Oh no, silly.
Odds are good it'll be bundled with the console.
Well the Kinect is good for homebrew mo-cap, though.
If not incorporated into it directly.
simply named xbox?
also having Blu-ray?
Without Kinect.
hello
AHAHA
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

i torrented myself some asian guys to do my math homework
thats nothing. we have a computer with a 5 terabyte hardrive
/me does a little research, and discovers the Bonus Army D:
13Jageman: he's referring to a bit as a binary decision
13one dna rung is two bits
yeah except there some recent reasearch that theres a whole bunch of code processing built into the code as well
1 terabyte=1024 gigabytes
:<
13yes but a bit of information is a bit of information
13dna takes two bits to describe one rung, four possibilities
hey
although isn't dna Quarternary?
13there are four bases that arrange in pairs
13but again, to describe one base, which has four possible states, you need two bits
13if one bit represents 1 or 0
13^
13but again the way he's referred to bits in the series he means binary
13state on or state off
13eeyup
r... wha?
13though the statistic i've heard is humans use 10 billion rungs of dna, which would take much more than 5 billion bits to represent, base 2 or 4
is he in our brain?

There is a roleplaying channeling?
is not problem.
well, yeah
I have chocolate chips!
You are taking on a persona of a character, that is considered RP.
My dear Jagerman, you do know of the energy of our cosmos, do you not?

11,02DerpyMuffins: Brawl time :3
/me sit
\:3/
Mister Jagerman, however with that, Energy is eternal by all means due to transformation from Energy to matter and back to energy, causing an endless cycle. If that's not infinite, I do not know where you would look at else.
More annoying than people roleplaying, is the massive fight erupting over people roleplaying.
Da.
See?
Hello
I was kicked :'(
Yeah we know.
We saw it happen.
Because you're roleplaying.
And I wan't breaking the rules
YOU WERE.
Yes, you were.

i cant do anything with my tools..
Gaaah
00,10you know at that shallow an entry angle it should bounce off the atmosphear
home safely :3
00,02Sumica, at those speeds probably not
Open chute....
Skype seems to dislike me. That's why I use it on my phone whenever I can.
less than 4km....
3km...
2km...
00,02Sumica, bout 3.6km/s when hitting the atmosphere
1km... o.o;
Whew.
00,10oh right I need to try KPS now that I have enough ram to support ships that I build
not drawings.. i want to draw on paintchat
Oooh, Bastion.
Bastion is good.
00,10mind you I should say "ships"
00,10cause realy they are more like ICBM's
00,02Sumica, icbm is best ship
00,02Sumica, i did, but they dont work the way i want them to
i only heard borderlands when i hear this song
00,10ahh
rendezvous or somthing tricky like that
00,10like I am one to call some one else out on spelling
00,02could try for an eve flight again
00,02this should be capable of it
00,02i wish the mirroring had more options
00,10so I cant realy build the tug type chassie that I want
did someone m+ in here or are just you two talking...
00,10bleeeh guess i need to get 17.1

Night Star
00,02yup
00,10cross feed fuel?
00,02and hopefully get him back
00,02Sumica, yeah, drains in a wierd circular patern
go justice
i haven't listend to them in a while
00,02bit more efficent than dropping the entire outer stage
00,10that the mecha Jeb?
00,10on the left?
00,02Sumica, yeah
00,10Top was like that too though
00,02far as i know thats all its capable of
00,10only did like 40 Mp/s
00,02this seperating is a bit risky
00,02i've had this explode more than once
00,10should use sep boosters
00,02exaust causes problems
00,02seems to be going up nicely
00,10I need to see if I can get my TSO files to play
00,10Trans-Siberian Orchestra
00,02close enough
00,02Sumica, i got the album in flac
00,02FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
00,10Same here
00,02my center stage has legged it
00,10but it's some crazy nonstandared file time
00,10so I have to put a plugin to my winamp
00,02well that is anoying
00,02and then it broke
00,02one more launch
00,02if i cant make this one work then i'll either stop streaming or do something else
00,02where'd everyone go?
Exam studies :3

00,10if you have had enough
00,02not particuarly interesting

00,02Gold_Gemona, ikr!
00,10probably just gonna play some towns
Hey, Digimon!~ Hey, Digimon!~
00,02was cool to watch the subbed japanese version and see why

I had fun with 12
I couldn't get into 12's story, and the characters are very bland.
The gameplay was alright. I kinda liked the fighting system in 12.
I thought the characters to 12 were good, at least there conversations
i beat both ff tactics
