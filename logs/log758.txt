@Alex I forwarded your question... Let's see if we get an answer. xD
I played Cod once...I sucked
alexxm, let's see, a guy was having problems fighting a boss zombie, and the only mechanic I remember he mentioned is running out of survivors. The key to the boss was upgrading his scanner to detect antibody packets.
xD

So much style.
That was glorious
Cheese in rice!
YES!!! ALL MY YES!
YEEEAH!
shhhh, fesoferbex, you never let them know that as it's happening ;)
13i attempted to exploit my embed switcher plugin to use the <object> tag set twitch demands you use, and failed!
What is with this game and burning people!
._.
Nope
13so the embed switcher cannot be used to inject code yaaaaaay
YEAH
@MD, sorry /)_- you're right!
what about good old iframe Shizuka?
/me has a phobia of house fires ._.
ups sorry :D
WOOO
13we're built on iframe, twitch forbids the player being embedded in iframe
I've got a challeng for one who want it : Sing Giggle at the gostly. ( The end is quite difficult because you have to sing at the same rapidity like Pinkie. 8D )
13you can embed chat in iframe, which is pretty stupid
ok IM not getting any kind of video feed
Can someone sing the cupcake song? Pretty please?
FIIIGHT MAH BROTHEEEERRSS

Did any of your artists ever think of creating an own song?
How do you kno who's an enemy and who's an ally?
Kandarihu: Magic.
Kandarihu: easy. alliers have green names
Question at Perry: Would you mind singing Discord, the Living Tombstone remix?
Question: JJ, who do you prefer? Molestia? or Gamer Luna?
Kandarihu: enemies have nothing
maybe tf2 rules apply - if it burns its an enemy
I am now silence
allies*
Kandarihu shoot people who shoot at you
Kandarihu: friendlies have nametags when they are in your crosshairs
ehrmagerd frendly fier wil naht be toleratud
I see, okay
Considering you thought about an own song and we have a fandom with many talented musicians... Why don't you try to combine these two facts? ;D
So much friendly fire
brb
I said would you mind
wow what a war zone
that was supposed to say zahmbies
Perry & Tsitra sing as a duet Daddy discord at 1200
Call of duty gets on to you when shooting civils, shooting civils, Russia

@DeerioJim added
BlaxBlain: Amnesia

Another question @ JJ; When Molestia says "I Came!" Can you shout out how you heard her say it in your head for us on the stream? I want to hear exactly how you felt it should be said by her.
Shizuka it's working fine on firefox if that helps
13so it's a chrome issue

Request: Rainbow Dash In loader suit from aliens screaming "get away from her...."

But sprunkls is true trollolol
that isn't really trolling
alexxm: If the Wii has been any indicator of how it has handled updates, all of the pieces act as their own "system". In other words, you have to update every individual piece at seperate times as opposed to all at once.
its back. seems switching streams now requires proper referrers to be sent.
twoiloight wat r u doin?
Question - If you were trapped with the other artists in this stream, in an elevator, for 3 days... What do?
that's more a little kid calling someone stupid because they're the one who's mad

Thanks SuperBrony64
i'll be back, i'm streaming now.. they inspired me.
welp seems like my internet isn't being turned off
Galacon and BronyCon are the same weekend, so, uh, good luck with that :)
It would be better. Celestia, the almighty overlord would make us happy with her magic and if that doesn't work, there's still princess Cadence :D
Is anyone as disappointed by yesterday's episode as I am?
I know I may be annoying but noone here having an opinion on what microphone is good?
thanks for the stream SuperBrony64 :)
alexxm good
thenkuu for streamoo SuperBrony64
Alma, I LOVED it
It's going to be awesome, though
CrystalPhoenix: There was WAY too much fan-service in that episode and too little content
CrystalPhoenix: What kind of microphone are you looking for?
Just teleport
This is THE, Worst, Possible, Thing!
Alma, you look too much into it
there was no fan-service
They shouldn't concentrate so much on making the episodes for the Bronies
finally i ended that pm with cachi01
thelonepony twilight_sprinkle MLP_Brovakiin http://pastebin.com/m9REUGWL
but if it is being turned off bye in advance

08,01and reasonably cheap

I want to see JJ (if he can) draw Fluttershy as Sleeping Beauty
its not right to then take them and post to everyone
twoiloight pls. this guy had it coming
I hate linecons. It's hard to avoid, though.
11,02Change in plans, going to keep streaming~
no he didnt, you insulted him first
cachi01|Blackcops2Za: Thanks for making me laugh out loud and spit my tea out :D
Especially for autographs. The math is hard to make work out nicely.
@JJ you have been to many cons this year. Don't you think you might overdo it with being at every single one of them? xD
woo
cachi01|Blackcops2Za: :D
/me cautiously pokes into chat
MLP_Brovakiin: lol u welcome
Alma, what exactly have they implanted to please Bronies?
Yay :D
i'm still here cachi01
twilight_sprinkle: yep i did. but at first it was joke lol then shit got real
I actually didn't say she have to sing it !
CrystalPhoenix: That previous generation Pinkie Pie face. That extreme example of Pinkie Pie breaking the laws of physics
Oh guys, I have a good idea. Since JJ can't decide to go to Gala or Bronycon. We should make a clone of JJ just like from pinkie pie episode. :D
Alma, that wasn't fan-service
No, of course not
Alma: and hooffingers
lol
wow 24 hours ban
that was unexpected :$
so they cannot make jokes anymore?
Carrot Top by Putuk: https://www.dropbox.com/s/1jxlgb4vkq3um9z/CARROTEATINGCARROT.png
MadSurge: :D ikr Lyra would be WTF
hmmm maby
Alma: Thats like recording a fat lady jiggle dancing naked and calling it quality porn.
lol... YES. They can not make jokes anymore
Say 1000 people want autographs, and each autograph takes only 45 seconds (barely enough time to say hi). That's over 22 hours of autograph time.
DoctoDoctorWho welcome back teacher
Really sucks. :/
but seriously there was no fan-pandering
No, of course there wasn't
wait wait
Question @JJ, Are you going to do more Human Daring Do or is she pretty much done?
Kujo_Jojo: Good eavening student
Alma, don't get sacarstic in my face
CrystalPhoenix: Why would I even attempt to try to convince someone?
this has been a fun day
/me sits in the back of chat and eats popcorn
This is the internet. Just agree and good is
DoctoDoctorWho evening*
General Question: Do you think the world would be a better place if the MLP:FIM Ponies were real?
idk why but the whole episode had a Rayman Origins vibe to me :D
be back got to end loop
Alma, only time you do that is when a debate goes in circle
http://poni.tylian.net/_images/f01dad8915d4d53142f8eb259e1ecbaa/327%20-%20discord%20gif%20popcorn.gif
Probably!
Weatherhoof has to drink it all xD
XP
CrystalPhoenix: Which it did
Is the stream at another place now?
/me noms cinema sweets from Skyfall
ok back
Discorbleh. Lol.
Alma, you haven't put any arguments on your claim
refresh it
its at http://events.yoursiblings.org/
can you not see it?
damn that was actually a pretty good drawing
try refreshing the page
That's not a debate
we changed a few things because of technicalm difficulties. just refresh the page if you can't see the streams
CrystalPhoenix: Only adult fans who are aware of the Bronie community and have a sort of meta-understanding of the series get these kind of jokes
Working now?
will we still see the stream of sui?

Swagestia: die
W00t!
/me applauds
CrystalPhoenix: To me it seemed like they concentrated a bit too much on that, but that is just my neglectible opinion
Faglestia :>
and now you made weatherhoof drunk :3
This might stand somewhere but anyway:When is Galacon?
Well, she still has 45 min.
Alma: That's exactly the reason I liked this episode - they are trying to appeal older fans... I can't see anything bad about that...
11,02Last warning Swagestia, stop spamming 'swag'.

I may die from how much I just drank

Dolkar has a point
they will be switching
i'm not spamming swag

Alma I can't agree with you on that, the episode was pretty solid and there was quite a lot of content to discuss about
not only one gag

yeah... even if we forward them they don't always get answered :/
:)
Its in every fucking racing game
11,02Meh, alright :P
SuperBrony64: 2nd > 3rd.
Applejack is best background pony
damn u tails
That's ok, just making sure they are at least getting logged.
Bronysith: hes just a kid
twist isn't even best plot twist
SpadeMagnes[R]: IKR?
MLP Napkins
Pink Celestia
Derpy is best wizard
What? I thought the target was 1st
most hilarious merchandise? That fail vector of Twilight Sparkle
why is she standing like that, does she have a cramo
so, stickers are like achievements?
*cramp
^
or do they actually do sth?
foreshadowing!
twilight_sprinkle, she's a fanservice girl.
Those backpacks are AWESOME
Lyra plushie
Kandarihu: that i can tell :D
Oh man, the Twilight singing plushie
I have that
2 More donations..
female heroes are always fanservice..
Oh yeah, those Rainbow Dash pyjamas are creepy
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353268042881.jpg have some daw
thats not even close to official MMC
And how has no one mentioned Pinklestia?
I saw some custom MLP diapers some days ago
She's got a steel knee from Vietnam, she can't bend her right leg
twilight_sprinkle, but that's why she's standing the way she does. She's EXPLICITLY fanservice.
Especially as the WLF pic has them being modeled by a ghost
dawww
You allready have a WiiU god damn
Are you looking to race friends, SB?
I want a tank so bad
heh ok Kandarihu
Fun Fact: Celestia is actually pink. The pinklestia toy is making PC alot more darker.
So is everyone watching stream on a different site or is there something I can faff around with in the tools setting of this thing?
http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Princess-Celestia/dp/B0043WAPJM
And that's not true of all female game characters
XD
Meanwhile: http://www.twitch.tv/superbrony64?utm_campaign=live_embed_click&utm_source=www-cdn.jtvnw.net
Question: Why so serious?
Yeah it's on twitch
11,02J_E_Smith71: Don't be silly...that would mean I have friends...
I know she's pink!
Taxidermy is a respectable job
Kandarihu: not all, but like 98%
Fucking, why?
Yeah, much like Rarity is actually a very light purple/blue
08,01SuperBrony64: my god, the very thought...

Hey, EightTrack! :D
The embed just says no.
some bronies just want to watch the artist sing
@zebranky thats kinda cool
I kind of feel that defeats the point of having an embed.
Alright well i'm going to do internet things.
Thanks EightTrack!
11,02HAI LOADING CIRCLE
Goodbye
Np, keep up the good charity work :)
Am I the only person that has the embed working?

Phase4 sorry not risking it i'm not watching that thing
Someone asking about playing Magicka in here?
SuperBrony64 friend code?
alexxm i've been good, yourself?
Meanwhile: Is SB playing WiiU
@pony_429860 [23:37:40] Tyro: Yes. I've played Magicka. It's interesting. A sort of top down shooter crossed with Doodle God.
Minutes aren't seconds, silly.
Turns out, toy engineers are pretty impressive. They really know how to do things super-cheap.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, Trust me, watch it
I havent heard it
Definitely not then.
its not the movie, its a review :P
SuperBrony64: You doing more Sonic or was that it?
i'm good Deacon
i mean the movie
Ooh, I should listen to that
feel free to ignore the movie
Should've told me that sooner, would've saved me the two minutes I spent pressing buttons.
I'm still a fan of "Set Fire to the Con"
i did watch the review
Did he do ZombiU yet?
Meanwhile: He was playing Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed
SuperBrony64: Sketch_Toku_Brony http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassesPull
Jeff Burgess?
Meanwhile: He's playing through every game for it he has in small chunks
Sonic really needs to stay in his grave.

Anything useful, or all salvage?
30 Euro Donation!
Everlasting_Joy: yes, all teh win
I got....2 rares which I TP'd for ~50 silver, 2 exotics (and a third which dropped during the event), and 2 unique exotic items that probably won't be available in any other way (one of which was an accessory, the other a 20-slot bag)
11,02Miiverse is best game :3
You should totally call them "bronations"
XD
20 slots. Nice.
These drawings :D.
Total value of the lot is probably around....6-7 gold or so
and now the success one
/me applauds
*claps*
black ops 2 costs 60 bucks??...
S'pretty good actually.
this is miiverse?
Not including the unique items, of course, which are account bound.
forgot to change the value the first time, so I had to do it again xD
Amazing
That Rageguy is hte best one.
It is.

Way better than usual events. I wonder if maybe they're learning.
Woohoo
I have the slender download in my askbox...
You rock

I wonder what kind of replies SB64's post is gonna get.

Yeaaah sinigiiing
Kandarihu: the one about shooting people?:P
screw typing. DRAW IT!

I wonder how a charity lifestream of just singing would go.
I'm pretty satisfied with the event, all told. The new dungeon kicks ass, too.
Kandarihu: ye lol that should be interesting
@pony_429860 it's already in the list ;)

05,15So guys....how bout dat Wii U?
twilight_sprinkle: I know :$
idk, i dont play consoles
05,15chat is ded
pretty good from SB's perspective
still waiting for Assassin's Creed 3 :(
don't knwo what to think about the WiiU, also ello fluttercry
and yes, i know it came out for CONSOLES on October 30
Hmm, I just did something amazingly stupid.
I refreshed the stream while it was working earlier
stream is over Kandarihu
Haven't seen anything for the Wii U
So can't say
twilight_sprinkle, I know, but it's 404ing me now
gotta so
*go
bye^^
It's the Wii U so I'm obligated to hate it on principle.
Oh then here
Lemme give you some reasons to hate the new XBox instead
New Xbox?
WiiU
The target demographic.
inb4 shitstorm
OP
That's all I need.
But I have better
"According to the mag's final 'exposé', the next-gen Xbox - which it speculates is likely to be called simply "Xbox" - will introduce Kinect 2.0, use Blu-ray discs and feature directional audio, a TV output AND input, 'innovative controller' and - at a later stage of the console's life - AR glasses."
........
You're right.
I hate it more now.
Told ya :D
meh
and nothing new was added
Gee, hating for the sake of hating? That's too much hate.
"With the new Kinect 2.0, you are now able to simulate a situation in which you simulate having a fun, enjoyable gaming experience."
Glorious PC gaming master race aside, consoles have been pretty depressing the last few generations.
Kandarihu: but its totally cool and the chicks dig it
i think it stopped with the discontinuing of the Gamecube
"Please note that the kinect 2.0 will not promise you any fun and, if you are looking for fun, the Kinect 2.0 may not be the simulator simulator for you."
twilight_sprinkle, what? Hate?
"Please note that purchasing the kinect 2.0 guarantees you a place in hell."
Kandarihu: yeah but im being sarcastic
Purchasing the Kinect 2.0? Oh no, silly.
Odds are good it'll be bundled with the console.
Well the Kinect is good for homebrew mo-cap, though.
"If you have any complaints, please put them in the box marked 'Incinerator', next to the 'Ancient Evil Awakening Tacitcs' box."
If not incorporated into it directly.
simply named xbox?
also having Blu-ray?
So not only will you HAVE to buy it to get the new XBox, likely you won't even be able to USE it. :P
Hello Professor
"Please note that spending too much time in the presence of the Kinect 2.0 can provoke tears in the fabric of reality and invite possession by the old ones who ruled the stars when mankind was young."
Without Kinect.
hello
Kandarihu: see because if you hate everything it means youre above it and smarter than the rest
Sony won the battle before even starting
AHAHA
Sony
twilight_sprinkle but wouldn't that make you more alone?
Buytoast, Sony in general
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
is there a video bieng steamed on your guys computer?
not the gaming department
Professor: nope
How are you, Professor
twilight_sprinkle, no it doesn't. It just means you're just a bitter fellow who's going to have an abnormally short lifespan from having a poor outlook on life.
I can forgive Sony because of the PS2. I liked the PS2.
i am good you?
Deacon: no because some people believe the same, that hating things make you smarter and above it, so theyll follow
Good thanks. :)
And that you're likely to drag other people down with you to an early grave.
Kandarihu: again, im beng sarcastic, and explaining why some do it
No stream?
Kandarihu: I consider that my duty to the universe.
can't wait for trixi episode:|
i mostly forgive Sony for the first couple of Crash Bandicoot games. games were awesome
But yeah. I can't wait until E3. :3
If Microsoft unveils a system like THAT, woo boy
It'll be hilarious
Kandarihu: it also provides an easy outlook on life, where you can be lazy and just say its not worth actually doing anything
every party needs a pooper
that's why they invited Kandarihu
Indeed.
I have to go everypony, ciao ^.^
Bye donutpop365
lol tfs phrase love it
Oh, best part though has GOT to be this part, which is meant to IMPRESS YOU with how amazing this console's tech is.
"Current codename 'Durango' dev kits boast a CPU with "four hardware cores, each divided into four logical cores" and an impressive 8GB of RAM, XBW reports."
Bye donutpop365
Kind of like how twilight_sprinkle was invited to fulfill the parties quota of being a bellend.
twilight_sprinkle, I hate that mentality. The self-proclaimed "equal opportunity haters" claim to be morally superior to bigots and racists, but they're just nothing but hate mongers
Meanwhile: You're doing that all by yourself. :p
WOW! You mean your brand new console has specs roughly equal to 3-year old gaming PCs? NICE
lol
GilDash come on now, you're meant to be in my corner. Get your head in the game.
Meanwhile: I actually don't know what it is you're fighting for. XD
Hell, MY rig can match the alleged specs of the new XBox if those are true. XD
i hate everything
GilDash: My right to hate things I hate.
does that make me a bad person Kandarihu?
Kandarihu hates you for hating everything.
well darn
i guess i'd better repent
Buytoast, you don't have to hate everything. Try appreciating stuff for once. What do you like?
Meanwhile: Whilst I might not like it, you do have a right to hate things pointlessly. Or with points. Just avoid prejudice and we're all good.
Splendid.
0,14I detect KVETCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
GilDash: Meanwhile is the hater this chat deserves.
why apprecaite anything when nothing else will go right?
hmm
And Buytoast is the hater it needs right now.
Everything is terrible.
I forget which one is meant to be Batman, but basically chat is Gotham City.

0,5ish so healthy
Smashburger?
0,5The Hub says so
XD no...
0,14I've had 5 Guys
/me is woona
0,14was pretty good
interesting, AssaultWithEmbraces
0,5I had 5 guys burgers
5 Guys is strangely good.
0,5they are good
next person, Jmo, what do you do for a living?
SaxyPretender, 5 Guys. AMIRITE /)
0,5they got neat fries
0,14(\ AssaultWithEmbraces
Boardwalk Fries! With Old Bay! :D :9
0,5Ooo saxy
13also for those following along, we still haven't worked out whether the universe is open or closed, we can't finish counting the amount of matter in the universe yet because dark matter
0,5Youve had 5 guys eh~?
0,5All at once?
BaconMane: .........
Shizuka, I thought the universe was massively open! WHut?
SaxyPretender: 5 guys burgers is pureawesomeness
No, MaconBane. Just.....no.
Sorry I won't be feeding your curiousity.
0,5Yus AJ yus
Screw physics, im Pinkie Pie
13Kurra: specifically, is the universe going to expand forever until everything dies, or is there enough stuff around that the cumulative gravity will bring it back to a big crunch
Nu, us stahp right naow MaconBane.
13we can't answer that yet because dark matter is screwing all the calculations up
Yaaaay, we can't worry about the universe expanding infinitely until there is just about nothing infinitely dispersed everywhere!
Star_Gazer, we shall 5 Guys one day if we ever meet up. We shall do that and burn our hands trying to get the burger out the forest of fresh fries
0,5I wnt stahp
u bettah shatp
0,5Jmo hlp me bby
AssaultWithEmbraces: of course
ayejay, its pointles to say taht
jaymoo won't help u. :3
he wont stahp
Shizuka AHAHAHAHA dark matter - let that one marinate on the scientists for a while XD
0,5ys he wll, hs my bby
u lie
the rice is a lie
hi eveypony
Someone ping me
13dark matter is pretty much the end of the "what will happen to the universe" question, if there's not enough, we expand forever and lose all energy billions of years down the line
AssaultWithEmbraces,
AssaultWithEmbraces: yes?
13if there's enough then eventually things slow down and smash back together
hi ajisawome
Screw Dark Matter, im Pinkie Pie
Elsie pls, I'm no-ones baby.

0,14Kinda hoping the Big Crunch happens
???
if the big crunch happens, i suspect time might repeat itself at some point
:$
0,14the loss of energy is a scary thought
You'll be dead before then.
weeping_pegasi82 :???
wtf is this
13if you think about it, if we determine there's enough dark matter for a big crunch, then we also have a probable cause of the big bang
SaxyPretender so we see the emergence of Galactus?
SaxyPretender: why would there be an energy loss
13all that stuff getting crunched together has to go somewhere
Shizuka, I hope everything collapses back down, it'd be really sad if everything and everyone got so dispersed that everything everywhere would be isolated for such a long time.
D:
0,5But jmooooo
13twilight_sprinkle: all the energy gets expended as things are further apart
D:
0,14...I would be okay with Galactus
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Nom de Plume

No buts Bacon

He won't be our problem anyway :P
:'(
13but yeah we'll all be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay long dead before that happens
/me nommed something
Shizuka: ah,well maybe all the wave energy will be reflected too though
get this out of my face
Speak for yourself. I plan to live forever |3
he said but lol
i have no life, i can not die
13forever's a long time :3
Kurra, i respond with a tragic Queen song

At a point in time, you and everyone you ever knew will be dust.

0,14I'm planning to have my ghost come back every once in a while, check to see what's going on, who needs a good haunting

He's a waterbender? :O

that or hes just a pt smoker like tehlonpon
twilight_sprinkle: I sort of hold Lucky Charms as sacred. It's my tie to childhood and youth, and I always imagine that all the sugar acts as a food of youth, and smiles. :) Which honestly, I need the placebo effect at least, as I get older and older. :(
twilight_sprinkle: :D
Kurra: ah, childhood eh :P

All the bits!
my cells are freakin' rich
5 BILLION MONEY
Blah Blah Blah, life is complex and amazing. We get it.
135 five gigabits, divided by 8 is less than a gigabyte
13that's a little over half a gig
13asuka here stores 3.5 terabytes, SO WHY DON'T I HAVE A BUNCH OF HUMENS ON MY HARD DRIVE
i do
Shizuka: 3.5 TERABYTES? :O
131.5TB internal, 2 external
Shizuka: each "bit" is acually 1 in 4 while a computer bit is 1 in 2
Shizuka: wait till it becomes self aware :)
Nice
i torrented myself some asian guys to do my math homework
Shizuka: Wow... :O
thats nothing. we have a computer with a 5 terabyte hardrive
/me does a little research, and discovers the Bonus Army D:
13Jageman: he's referring to a bit as a binary decision
13one dna rung is two bits
yeah except there some recent reasearch that theres a whole bunch of code processing built into the code as well
o n o..science!
Shizuka: i know, but our dna is not binary
1 terabyte=1024 gigabytes
:<
13yes but a bit of information is a bit of information
13dna takes two bits to describe one rung, four possibilities
hey
although isn't dna Quarternary?
ugh more science
13there are four bases that arrange in pairs
13but again, to describe one base, which has four possible states, you need two bits
13if one bit represents 1 or 0
Shizuka: yes which would be a base 4
13^
13but again the way he's referred to bits in the series he means binary
13state on or state off
Shizuka: so he is simplifying it?
13eeyup
r... wha?
13it's cosmos, it was designed to popularize science
13though the statistic i've heard is humans use 10 billion rungs of dna, which would take much more than 5 billion bits to represent, base 2 or 4
is he in our brain?

Hi, CrazyHippie. :)
hi CrazyHippie
Hi AJIsAwesome and Canadian_Brony
haha i see what you did there
13it's not all great though, like i said earlier we still haven't worked out how much dark matter there is and whether the universe will expand forever or eventually collapse
:P
oh theres plenty of work left to be done
hi CrazyHippie btw
Shizuka: Imagine feeling the Universe collapse
Shizuka: We don't even know what dark matter is. We only have guesses.
And ello twilight_sprinkle
13i want to be there billions of years from now when the crunch starts, some new life evolves and begins science
13and when they look up and see all the galaxies screaming towards them
13we have it easy, the galaxies are running away :3
Sounds painful
seems legit
and in the future, Shizuka will be their overlord.
Shizuka: life might be impossible at that point
Shizuka: and i think it was solved that the universe will accelerate out of control and have a big rip in about 17 billion years
Shizuka: the great epiphany of that time: "...oh fuck"
xD
13mm last i read up the dark matter question is still up in the air, especially in light of the higgs
13there could still be enough matter to close the universe
why is shizukas text pink?
becasue moderator
Because purple was taken?
hes a mod
CyberTheDjPony, because... ponies.
CyberTheDjPony she's a mod and mods are allowed to have colourful text.
Mod color.
Punkie_Pue: she*
CyberTheDjPony: Mods have color
Punkie_Pue: *she
ooh
Sorry
She is a mod
Because he donated 10000 dollars to bronystate CyberTheDjPony
uh... dat nipple?
CrazyHippie: *She :)
Do we know yet if the Higgs particle has mass?
she******
Shizuka: I guess dark matter could be the variable that throughs all our predictions about the future off.
13it causes mass
I had no idea. Im sorry.
^
._. k then
s'alright
13higgs is the force carrier for mass, like photons for electromagnetism and gluons for strong force
13that i know of
anyone want to rp with me?
Oh okay :)
i would
Jezebel... no
i guess
inb4 people jump.
rp?~
role play
13this sounds like it belongs in an enigma track
PonyBean roleplay
xD
i knew that..>o>
:P
It is so weird, that there is a particle that CAUSES mass, as if it were a flag that has to be turned on for things to have susbstance XD
lol
it kinda does . . . what the hell?
So far, a big crunch has been ruled out by observations, but we have not been observing for long.
So whats next Shizuka? ^^

and then Beast Wars happened and almost mucked everything up :)

Cool it with the spam, CyberTheDjPony.
Vordox because FUN!
Jageman, who? us?
CrystalPhoenix: Pinkies everywhere...
For some reason this song reminds me of The Force Unleashed II where you grapple your enemy by stabbing him with one of your lightsabers and then flip-throwing him.
Celestia: Greetings then, Princess.
me: http://billybobfm.webs.com/Devbest/Bbs_P3.png
well it was this week's episode
Hello, Vordox.
All the FUN. :D
Celestia: Should you really have time over, I thought being a princess took most of your awake time doing your chores.
ALEX!!!

I don't have chores. Just protect.
FAHK YEAH *smashes head on keyboard*
"I'll have to give myself a PRRRROMOTION!"

Stallion_of_War huh, forgot about that episode of foster's
We sleep, It's just that I'm nocturnal and sis sleeps when I guard
Stallion_of_War, the clone trope has been done a lot of time in other cartoons
Oh my god

Refresh the stream and the whole thing starts all over
and we need to watch Foster's home for imaginary friends
fun?
AttackWithHugs, wait......we have THE FLASH EMBED?
Ok I'm with Vordox
Mod WHY
CrystalPhoenix, apparently so
I JUST refreshed and it restarted.
Celestia: How big is your sun? Also, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
Those questions are for Luna too.
kirz \:3/

Does it loop?
Hello?
bonjour!

yep
Sup?
Aaah

GamerLuna: How big is your sun? Also, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
what, you thought there was an end?
Admittedly, yes.
It never ends.
I don't know what it is
But it never ends.
Then I hit the magical Refresh button and...
So, how about that airline food?
I'm surprised the stream hasn't crashed because Pinkie
hELLO
lali-ho lUNA
AJIsAwesome f*cking disgusting.
I know if you have ONE Pinkie on Desktop Ponies and go to play a game, she multiplise like mad and lags your computer to hell
Canadian_Brony: I know, right?
Even pizza is bad.
is it that bad? never flown myself?
How do you f*ck up pizza?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Why does the stream have pinkie pies in it?
CrystalPhoenix: WUT
why not?
Magic
Celestia: ... You haven't forgotten the sun, have you...?
I'm so old I forgot! :3
No, I lowered it. The moon is high, right, Luna?

Deacon: Most of it is. It's been very rare that I have had "okay" food.
I don't control the sun, just the moon, but I think it's half the size of the sun, and I dont know about the reason they dont appear at the same time, my sis is the older one, she should, I think
WOAH
lightIRC's derping the crap out for me
yes, there is stream
Hello
Chat exploded

Shizuka: So...is this stream online or offline?

Hi there Celly
Test?

Hello Luna
Oh, my. This is kinda insane... I think we split the universes again.
flutter_spin: no it's not live, it's just an embeded video loop
back
hmm
So many Pink mares
Personally, I prefer the VIP remix of Party with Pinkie, but the original is really good too.
we should have a loop of seasons 1, 2, and 3 of the chasers war on everything
I was "kicked" ( whatever that is) by somepony, and had to change my name on this website chat.
Where did Celestia go?
alright. Change it.
ok
I'm here
Newfoals can't ghostforce. Again.
Princess: That was daribot
What the hell eh?
What is this flash stream thing??
Princess: So, why don't the sun and moon appear in the sky at the same time?
TO THE MOON, DARIBOT
Canadian_Brony, I like Trixie the Troll Pony original
Princess: it's because you tried using the nick Luna, which is a bronystate staff member
GamerLuna: I wonder, have you seen the new intro for FFXIV? =3 It's quite a masterpiece of an intro
I think lightIRC can't handle all the pinkies
Kurra not funny dude.
I'm not annoyed, i'm just wondering where all my CPU eh
oh, it was dari
Oh.

funfact: chewing on a blasting cap is a bad idea
Lyra` why are you talking to yourself? I do it irl, but you're typing it in the chat.
Derpy_Hooves: May I ask how so?
/me would like to take this moment to remind the admins that not everyone has 16GB of memory and 128 CPU cores to handle so much Pinkie Pie X_X
AJIsAwesome: it crushed the wind pipe
Derpy_Hooves didn't know that
OH.
i <3 adventure time
Oh......
i was talking to Jageman, Canadian_Brony
/me is feeling radical!
Jageman, The answer is, It is there so a blackhole doesn't appear
Lyra` oh, misread some stuff I guess.
also, im a sociopath with PTSD, i can do whatever i like~
;)

Mistress_RainBowDash I thought it was hilarious. I especially liked the "test". There actually is a fan-fiction called "Pinkie Watches Paint Dry", and I just laughed when I remembered. Then there was G3 Pinkie . . . *shudders*
I'm still waiting for when Luna gets her own song.. And Celestia.
Trixie is best pony :|
whats up
oh, its Mistress_RainBowDash on?
oof~
Well, Trixie IS the worst pony.
Hello, GamerLuna, How are you?
going to #ponychat
Ok Jageman. Glad I helped
/me bonks his hoof on Meanwhile
shit it cannot go
trixie is the best
we have some things to 'talk' about, Mistress_RainBowDash.
didn't mean to say that
Trixie is best pony and I have the only reason needed to explain why
Lyra`: do you play anything else besides the lyre?
Im good, what about yourself?
:P
Fuck you, thats why
Vordox that might take forever to get to
DoomSong: ummm what ?
actually, i play the lyre, the harp, and jazz trumpet, irl
:S
/me goes into a 35-minute tirade about the injustices of forced planned obsolescence and unsusttainable computing and how the industry is invisibly bending up to its will and how it creates idols out of our electronics that it demands we worship through our wallets and....
hmm
Deacon: Indeed I know.
Oh my gosh
CrystalPhoenix, I attempted and failed :I http://i.imgur.com/LWDOe.jpg
Kurra: tl;dr
^
The next episode has already leaked http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzEUeWnV73U
>_>
Im calling bull
hmm, the jumping pinkies are neat,but i not being able to mute it is a problem
CrystalPhoenix XD
and im working on the piano, because i want to play Nocturne Op 9 No 2 in e flat
CrystalPhoenix: And you're linking this here why? :S
such a wonderful piece~
i drew my pony avi..though i look more like starbuck coffe more than anything lol
AJIsAwesome, if you bothered clicking you'll understand why
ajisawsome u there

nyeh
I'm good GamerLuna
AJIsAwesome: dont its still spoilers
Princess, are you okay, you keep changing your facial structure, trying something?
goddamnit CrystalPhoenix seriously
08,01Kurra: no, i mean what load are you running?
Lyra`: sounds hard to do with hooves.
twilight_sprinkle it's a joke
twilight_sprinkle no it isn't, it's a song called "One Bad Apple". It's not pony related in the slightest
Lyra`: but i agree, it sounds beautiful
Canadian_Brony, only Bad Apple
So whats the topic for tonight, or there several conversations going on at the same time?
no idea
drop the bass canon
wait
hmm
wait
Deacon: ah ok. still, annoying
CrystalPhoenix thx
no
Vordox, I'm over 3,000 years old.
no
That anwser your question?
aww no drop the bass
there is just something about this composition on the violin that brings tears to my eyes
Princess please, I predate this universe
its a painful beauty that pierces the soul
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChJVhc285NU
Chopin?
Princess: How old does your species normally live?
Whatever [SWAG]Haku
dammit, how do you mute the stream?!?
only onions
oh gosh yes
can some1 chage the song
08,01Kurra: no, i mean what are you running that is putting it under load...
the sorry and regret in the opening is enough to tear at the heartstrings of any music lover
FOREVER
:$ Well, if that is what you wish to say.
Princess you jelly, child?
man how mute it
Why's chat devolved into 14 year olds.
Princess: sounds unsustainable.
Hey, who put this bowl of onions here?
THERE SHOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL FOR THIS THING
08,01and is that load1, load5, or load15?
No, ALL DA FILLIES JELLY OF ME
twilight_sprinkle: Pop it out and close it
pinky pie overload chage it *boom*
guess no choice but yo popout
you know, are youtube links even allowed at the moment? technically, there is something on the stream
Jageman, you are correct.
Punkie_Pue: yeah thats what i was thinkiing
even if it is hundreds of hopping horses
Technically it isn't a stream, it's an embed.
Princess Well, to me, you are a filly, so does this make you jelly-ception?
fair enough
Buytoast2, good point but it's technically not live
08,01...
Princess: so, when life on your world dies, you will be all alone forever?
08,01you only have yourself to blame, then
but the uplifting nature of a depressions exodus from the heart at the climax and finaly of the piece is a fluttery feeling in ones heart, a feeling of elation and happyness
08,01hey Phase4!
twilight_sprinkle I'm running Chrome, which runs each tab and window as a seperate application, so I can just mute the BronyState tab. Otherwise, I got nothin'
TT____TT
Jageman, I have Luna and Cadence
11,02Time for video games \:D/
Princess: With only your sister and discord for company?
What do you mean only myself, I don't have money for a million cores
11,02Refresh embed :3
Princess: Cadence too?
chage it fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu *booooom*
Canadian_Brony: do you use ctrl alt del for that or the windows audio mixer?
Yes, Jageman
08,01Lyra`!
NewSuperBronyU does that mean . . . Wii U?
Oh heavens saved by gaming
11,02Yesh :3
NewSuperBronyU: Super Metroid?
dodododo
Someone give me a motherfucking table to flip!
Vordox, I think he gave up on that game long ago
lalalalalal lala lalala
newsuperbronyU can u chage the song
Princess: Sounds very sad.
more Block Caps Too?
/me gives Canadian_Brony a table
[SWAG]Haku, You're the filly. I'm the princess. I'm old. I'm not a filly, idiot
Princess: What will you do when you outlive your world?
Jageman, not as bad as it counds
wait, this ain't Wii U . . . WTF am I looking at?
If I refresh is the Wii going to come up?
Princess. your words and manners, please.
Because if so, fuck that, I'm leaving the Pinkie thing on.
Princess Age is all about relevance. You may be 3000 years old, but I predate this existence. TO me, everypony is a child, including one as old as yourself
Jageman, I will chat, play games ect.
if you refresh, you get nothing
Pinkie really did take over the stream
except something telling you to go to another website
Meanwhile, you can't have Pinkie's when there's a stream, I think...
oh, that thing again.
11,02If it asks, you'll need to copy and paste the URL it shows in a new window to get to the stream.
fuck i hate pinkypie chage it *boom*
twilight_sprinkle windows audio mixer, and it muted all of Chrome, so it kinda backfired..
hi
11,02Hai Lemony_Burst :)
hi
Kurra: Need to refresh to update the embed. I'm keeping my Pinkie spam.
oh okay.
11,02You see the stream?
YES
I do
Hi :D
[SWAG]Haku, so if everypony is filly, that means you're one too.
Super why would you even use a service like that?
Canadian_Brony: ah ok, thats what it does for me too
hi Lemony_Burst
hi canadian brony
Princess: you will not have a computer forever. when it break down what will you do?
And, sorry Vordox
BRB
All bouncy pinkies
what are we watching?
Jageman, I will heal it with my Alicorn powers.
Black Ops II on the Wii U I think..
Do not worry too much Princess, it's a common trait here that argument rises, it's just matters of talking to some of the younger ones, or older.
11,02Black Ops II on the Wii U
oh 1 sec
Princess: even if you know how to fix all your games and electronics, how will they entertain you for all eternity.
if u r wear headphones push then in ur ear
11,02Playing with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
Jageman, I can make some up.
Princess: and who will you chat with, when your world is dead.
Ok, Vordox.
You know this all to well already, Princess.
NewSuperBronyU!
Ow.
ok I can't see anything
Jageman, Luna, Cadence, and Discord.
Okay, this is impressive.
That looks like itd be awkward
HI EVERYPONY
Princess: how far can you go with games you made yourself, chatting with the same ponies everyday?
hi RainbowDashie
Sorry for undermining you in speech if you misunderstood me.
I am gonna go BYEEE!!!!!
dufuq was that throw?
Vordox, YES i DO oops, caps
Princess: how long till everything that can be said has been.
Jageman. I make a new world
This is why you check behind you.
Princess: How, you don't have that power.
quick!
Hooves getin the way often, agreed Princess.
You know what to do!
Princess: If you did, death would not happen in Equestria.
Jageman. With help from Cadence and Luna.
Jageman, of course.
Princess: your powers have limits
How do yuo know, Jageman?
Knowing Black Ops II is on the Wii U kinda makes me want to play it . . . what is happening to me?!?
Princess: thats why you needed the elements of harmony
Canadian_Brony, is it snowing for you?
I . . . /want/ . . . to buy a cod game.
Until Twilight showed up.
- evil laughter -
<.<
Princess: Discord would not be a threat if you were all powerful.
Canadian_Brony, DON'T DO IT BRO
Lyra` it hasn't snowed since mid-October., unfortunately.
Of course, she doesn't live eternily.
:o
/me glomps MahBoi777 :3
0,14mfw I leave a twitch stream for Melee
Discord would if he loved me. For attention. To look powerful.
0,14and then I see a Twitch embed
Princess: everything ends Celestia.
Not me.
SaxyPretender, such a thing exist?
Or Luna, Cadence or Discord
CrystalPhoenix meh, I'll consider when I (hopefully) get the Wii U sometime next year. Probably will go for ZombiU instead.
Princess: there are no exceptions
0,14yeah, people are still playing Melee
Why does it take like 7 rounds to drop a person who's two inches away? :|
Yeah
0,14if that's what you mean
ZOMG!
ZombiU looks way more interesting
oh, mhy friend NewSuperBronyU is streaming <3
Princess: even reality itself has an end point.
I have ALL knowledge. Jageman.
i honestly like him.
SaxyPretender: Well, it IS a good game. :3
hes a great guy
then again maybe more interesting game might come out by that time
lets say nice things about him
*coughBayonetta2cough*
0,14tru dat, AJIsAwesome
I'm magical dumbplot, Jageman.
SaxyPretender: lemme guess, there was 15 more warmups
0,14so many warmups you could cook an egg
avenger!revenge!
11,02OH SHIT BACKUP BACKUP
Princess: oh, so Queen Crysalis snuck by you because you wanted her to, right?
haha
CrystalPhoenix but I also have a friend who might get it for PS3. I know the experience will be different, but I'll get a rough feeling for what I'm putting cold, hard cash into
XDDD
But seriously, like always more than one bullet to kill someone in this game, why
Princess: she also defeted you.
Jageman, you are really smart. Figure it a\out
Twilight defeated HER
Kurra: If the game was perfectly realistic, it would be boring :)
Princess: I know you don't have all the answers.
Princess: you have limits
Jageman, so do you
Princess: Accept them
soulrider95, Rainbow Six was like that, challenging as hell.
You to
Princess: I never stated i did not.
well at least you'll get to try it without spending a cent AJIsAwesome
Princess: I know i will end some day
CrystalPhoenix: ?
Princess: nothing is forever
Kurra: it may be good for single player, but in multiplayer getting killed by one bullet from anything kinda makes balance difficult.
Jageman, you said everything has a limit. So does knowledge
Hehe.
CrystalPhoenix umm, did you mean to ping me?
^
OOOPS
Princess: yes
yeah
trololololo
sorry AJ
Jageman, exactly :)
It's cool.
it's late
Oh yeah, and I defenitely won't buy it if I can't Prone Dive. God DAMN that is fun!
11,02:(
Princess: so, what is your limit?
Canadian_Brony: You can dolphin dive in this game.
11,02Canadian_Brony: You can prone dive in this game
Oh hell, killed by a UAV :(
Yay!
Jageman, of what? knowlegde, age, ect?
Princess: why didn't you know about the queen changling in your own house?
Anyone else play this on PC?
Kurra UAV is radar..
:p
11,02The Wii U Pro controller can last up to 80 hours on a single charge O.O
IKR?
well, killed by some kind of aircraft...
NewSuperBronyU: whoa o_o
Princess: where you too focused on external threats to see the one inside?
that long?
wowsers
Jageman, that is in the past. Focus on the present. That's over now
wiiu, now can last up to 80 hours of updates on a single charge!
NewSuperBronyU: *up to, I doubt it will last nearly that long under use.
Twilight is the one you should be interviewing.
Princess: So, you admit you made a mistake and want to move passed it.
Lyra` I considered saying "That's what she said", but it wouldn't be funny 'cause you're a girl..
Okay I'm back for like the 20th time today
Princess: I like you.
Yes Jageman, we all do
x.x too much
I hope I don't have to do anything
0,14technially, wouldn't that be what she actually said, Canadian_Brony
Thank you Jageman. I like you
:(
Stop by the palace and stay a while if you want Jageman.
Princess: I like anyone who can admit their mistakes, but not let those mistakes stop them from doing their duty.
black ops eh?
Yep.
SaxyPretender that's why it wouldn't be funny! And I've seen someone try a "That's what she said" on a girl. She kicked him in the nuts, which was hilarious :D
Princess: Both you and your sister have my deepest respects.
Yes Jageman.
0,14XD
Thank you. Jageman, where is Luna?
Must be at bed.
Canadian_Brony uh, ouch
Princess: what time is it there?
Nope sis, Im right here,
Deacon it's funny when it doesn't happen to you.
12:18
Jageman.
Princess, Im still here
Canadian_Brony still, ouch though
Princess: I though it was nighttime in equestria?
0,14Oi, Princess and GamerLuna, tone down on the roleplaying
Blockt
0,14this isn't a roleplaying channel
Princess: or does equestia not sync up with earth time?
Oh, Luna! Hello! <3
SaxyPretender Finally someone said it to them
Deacon he's fine, don't worry. He had a cold can of beer on hand.
GamerLuna: there you are.
Equestria has 30 minuts of daylight and 30 of night, enough to film one episode.
Haha, heeyyyyyyyy Jageman
Jageman, We are at night. Our time is different froms humans.
GamerLuna: Celestia and I have been talking.
about what?
SaxyPretender Someones not getting the message :S
Please take it easy with the RP, Princess and GamerLuna. :)
Princess: you have a different arbitrary way of mesuring time?
There is a roleplaying channeling?
Jageman: You? Talk to Celestia? About GamerLuna? Are you insane?
Pff, what RP :p
GamerLuna: about stuff?
Jageman, no
is not problem.
What stuff Jageman?
GamerLuna: mostly about limits.
There is no ' role playing' AJisAwesome
GamerLuna: about the fact that nothing is forever.
Now is Forever... o/~
nothing is forever?
GamerLuna: everything fades in time.
Princess: actually acting like your celestia is called roleplaying
well, yeah
I have chocolate chips!
You are taking on a persona of a character, that is considered RP.
My dear Jagerman, you do know of the energy of our cosmos, do you not?
AssaultWithEmbraces: :O
/me takes on his fursona in here, he RPs too
persona/ponysona
I AM Celestia. Derpy_Hooves
inb4 SaxyPretender cleans up the room
Jageman, keeping with that, no energy can be "ended".
Vordox: You will never convince me that anything is eternal, not without lots of evidence
AJIsAwesome, yep. Gonna make chocolate pancakes tomorrow morning.
Inb4 "Are you ok"
kirzstryfe Please for the love of the mane chat this is getting really annoying
Jageman: Then what is the point if your discussion if it's never meant to bend?
AssaultWithEmbraces: Sounds AWESOME. :O
I'd kill it if I could :p
AJIsAwesome because it is.
AssaultWithEmbraces mmm, those are good . . .
Greetings kirzstryfe !
it's not annoying.... c.c
Vordox: energy does not end, but it does fade out of this universe
First time I ever made pancakes, I made them huge.
AssaultWithEmbraces: :O
Didn't want pancakes for 3 weeks after that
XD
the rp does get annoying, it's not like it's difficult to go off and make your own channel for it
Jageman: It cannot fade, which is an oddity since Energy is, by all terms proven, eternal.
kirzstryfe you've got strong ties to the inner networks. Get them to do it for you
pancakes. make 'em with chocolate chips
Vordox: through the membranes that make up matter/energy.
Princess: good for you, but acting like her in this channel is called rp :P
Vordox: energy is not eternal
0,14All right
Wait a second, you can watch YouTube videos on the gamepad?
0,14that's it
I AM real Derpy_Hooves
kirzstryfe True but did said ponies try and stop when asked?
0,14It's kicking time
Vordox: if it was, the universe would be eternal
Inb4 kicks
Kurra even better, use some pecans, delish :P
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand night for me
Kicking time
Good night everyone
Night, CrystalPhoenix.
Night CrystalPhoenix
You wanna see annoying? Have someone roleplay GILDA. And then give them ops. That's a freaking totalitarian regime in channel, fluff.
g'night CrystalPhoenix
Hello
Vordox: energy has a begining, and mathimaticly has an end.
Mathematically*
Vordox: unless you factor in string theory
I was kicked :'(
beginning*
honestly it's soothing that someone would play at characters who are gentle, overall.
AGAIN :'(
thank you meenwhile
Princess Then stop RP'ing
lol
JUST HAVIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGG FUN!
Maybe you wouldn't be kicked if you did as you were told and stopped being a gimboid.
roleplaying is forbidden here you know
you had it coming
Princess Not if your breaking rules
Going back to basic NewSuperBronyU?
/me roleplays a character.
you're*
Meanwhile what's a gimboid? :3
Know how to have fun without breaking the damn rules
killerpony7733 Just having fun is breaking the rules?
Jageman: No, String Theory is not taken into account, the argument would be not able to change then.
11,02DerpyMuffins: Brawl time :3
Derpy_Hooves: It's British slang used to describe the stupid.
/me sit
Meanwhile kewl, learin new things all day erry day
\:3/
Meanwhile you're british?
11,02I'm nervous about transferring everything over from my old Wii to the new Wii U, so I'm just going to keep using my old system for Wii content for a while longer :)
Mister Jagerman, however with that, Energy is eternal by all means due to transformation from Energy to matter and back to energy, causing an endless cycle. If that's not infinite, I do not know where you would look at else.
Hai Derpy_Hooves
More annoying than people roleplaying, is the massive fight erupting over people roleplaying.
No, Meanwhile is Russian.
Da.
Much more so.
See?
Hello
Princess If you RP here yes. Theres other places for that on this network. So this place isn't your own amusement park obey rules if you want to stay or find a more suited place or if you can't do neither you should just stop
Kurra: I understand, but this isn't a RP channel. RP is technically discouraged here.
I was kicked :'(
Yeah we know.
Vordox: The universe is not eternal, neither is time. it had a beginning.
We saw it happen.
Jesus.
Awesome chorus as always NewSuperBronyU
Because you're roleplaying.
And I wan't breaking the rules
YOU WERE.
/me facepalms for the chat
Yes, you were.
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh :3
OH MY GOOOOOOOD.
I smell ban
goddamn, your head must be thicker than a coconut
killerpony7733, so do I
Jageman: The universe is a space of matter and energy, and it'll expand and then the reverse, but once it's collapsed, a new energy and mater from those causes another existance, therefore, a cycle.
HOW IS THAT BREAKING THE RULES? oops caps please dont kick me
NewSuperBronyU this is why you stick everything on an SD card, copy all the files onto your computer, transfer one file copy to your Wii U and leave the rest on your Wii. Surprisingly useful.
PrincessCelestia http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
The skull is actually about as thick as a coconut.
Go freshen up on them.
Because RP is discouraged here, PrincessCelestia.
Vordox: the universe will not collapse
ok, just calm down PrincessCelestia, and everyone else
well fine, thicker than a steel ball
either way
Would everyone kindly take their right or left hand and place it on their forehead? Thank you and have a nice day.
BALLLLZ OF STEEL
Yeah Deacon.
Vordox: that model has lost credit due to observation
why is it? It shouldn't be
Yeah the thickness is above safe parametres.
AssaultWithEmbraces why did I just do that..
Its just fun
Jageman: So if it doesn't collapse, it's eternal? Your argument is ripping holes in your own statements.
Canadian_Brony, becuase the Force
Good morning everypony :)
riiiiiiight >.>
yo NocturnalBlade
And I love Celestia
hi NocturnalBlade
:'(
Hi, NocturnalBlade.
Night, NocturnalBlade
Vordox: you misunderstand
/me fret :<
Well, go roleplay in another chatroom.
PrincessCelestia Sorry but your definitation of fun is against the chat rules. So find a suited place for it not here when it annoys people
AssaultWithEmbraces: lol like the name ^_^
Canadian_Brony, :3
Chav
Ffffffff....
Vordox: the universe is expanding at an increasing rate
What Aussie chav?
I have less than 2GB space.
Go chat in another chatroom.
jmo why are you talking?! GAWD
:V
Well if I'm hated here why not?
Nah.
Cya everypony
Bye DerpyMuffins
Bye, DerpyMuffins.
seeya DerpyMuffins
did anypony view the picture
Now you british prick. :|
Vordox: eventually it will expand so fast it will rip itself appart
PrincessCelestia Your not hated but you annoy people
PrincessCelestia no worrie, you're not hated
/me hugs Deacon Canadian_Brony AJIsAwesome and AssaultWithEmbraces
You're*
my name is ghosting again
bye DerpyMuffins
AskPeachy ehh, which one?
/me hugs Jmo \:3/
11,02Canadian_Brony: Content is linked to the system, it's either I transfer everything over at once or nothing at all.
How do I annoy?
PrincessCelestia: I hate you. Just to be clear.
/me hugs NocturnalBlade :D
Why are you hugging me?
/me hugs Jmo
Why not?
:O Brawl!
I know that already Jageman, but you forgot the very basic rule, the pulling forces.
Vordox: after that, physics does not know anthing.
By roleplaying in a channel that isn't one for such things.
Jmo cause you kewl :3
meawhile...
Right.
>Joomay >Cool
I'm sorry
I'm not even cool.
There is a huge flaw in your logic.
Vordox: please be more specific
Your birth was a flaw in logic Chav.
11,02Smash Bros. on the Wii U is going to be amazing o.o
...
The observation of the universe do not disapprove if it'll become pulled back into it's original form.
:OOOOO
Gimme some burn cream.
:'(
I don't know which side of that to watch, the no-rp part, the science, or the "sane" part
PrincessCelestia You should just not RP here that's it. Cause this channel is not a roleplaying channel. Just talk with people in general and discuss interests just not roleplay
The amount of time to see that is probable even longer then the earth's life current life cycle, and even if then it'll almost be impossible to measure even with that in mind.
All I can see is gibberish.
You see gibberish, I see bullshit.
Same difference Moojay.
I see strawberry poptarts
One is more enforced.
AssaultWithEmbraces: nice new nick
Thanks, SpeccyRush
death by Pokeball
HI!
hi Soarin
on the bright side, I got skylanders giants today
Vordox: there is no evidence that the universe will be pulles into a big crunch
Hi Soarin
HI
Jageman: And there's evidence that it'll rip?
Every hour on the hour... :|
Vordox: no, the only evidence right now supports the big freeze
.
hi Soarin
oh awesome. Did you play it at all?
Jageman: The big freeze?
hi NocturnalBlade
We already said hi, Soarin. You silly filly~
Vordox: the universe will expand soo big that all the energy will be spread too thin
Jageman: Sounds like when things expand too far, it'll cause all the heat to be drawn out over huge area and causes freeze?
hello everypony
Hi, haseo348.
oh smash brother
s
Oh sorry there AssaultWithEmbraces
/me looks at the rubber band infront of him, and then pull it out.
0,14mfw Brawl on the stream
It feels heat to me
0,14and I just saw a melee tourney
Vordox: however, if the univers continues to expand at an increasing rate, it could have a big rip
0,14THE CYCLE IS COMPLETE
lol SaxyPretender
Tonight is a good night, Saxy?
hey..that music for that stage sounds familair...
0,14I suppose so
SaxyPretender: All you need to see is a Smash Bros Tourney.
0,14I can easily host one at my club
Jageman: But wouldn't the vacuum of space cause a force to bring the universe together once more?
What is this box that say some URL with SB64's name on my stream?
0,14Smash is, unsurprisingly, really popular
Vordox: no
also, Hakus back
Sup, SOar
Heyt
Hey, GamerLuna
lol you so sillly
SaxyPretender: Because you have your favorite characters beating the heck out of each other. :D
Vordox: a vacuum would only do that if there was pressure on the outside of the universe pushing in
hmmhmm
oops
0,14personally, I prefer other fighters like Soul Calibur V, Persona 4 Arena and Guilty Gear, but Smash is also fun to watch
Jageman: And we have any proof of it NOT being therE?
SaxyPretender: nice choices ^_^
Vordox: yes
SaxyPretender: blazblue
SaxyPretender: what about ultimate marvel vs capcom 3?
Vordox: love it
Vordox: the universe is not collapsing
o...o i say its a pretty decent fighter.
Jageman: Please do tell me where you find your fact that there's no outside push from outside the observable Universe.

Vordox: the universe is not collapsing
0,14Blazblue is fun, but everything after CS2 doesn't feel fun
Vordox: the universe is mostly empty
0,14and UMvC3 is shenanigans the game
Jageman: I did not say it was at that state currently
Vordox: what state?
0,14which is a good thing

Jageman: Birth state
0,14nothing beats getting a happy birthday

.......
So is SB streaming now or what?

Because my stream has this weird box thing on it
OH OH i wanna join...
And it has Sb64s name on it

0,14yeah he is, [SWAG]Haku
i kinda wanna join and get my but kicked again lol
*butt
Well I aint getting it
Vordox: when the universe began?
All Haku is getting is this weird URL box whing
Jageman: It's still in it's beginning stage.
[SWAG]Haku: Copy the link and paste it in the search bar.
...
I dont wanna
Vordox: the universe is 13 billion years old
Hello and goodnight, SaxyPretender :3
PAWCN
Should I popout the chat?
I'm bored
0,14oh hai Flaria!
Hey, Phase4. Is there no way to fix this "Top-program/window" problem with TF2 windowed mode?
08,01Flaria!
0,14how've you been?
Jageman: Indeed, out of it's age of...what...
08,01long time, no see!
while its loading?
Jageman: 100000 Billion?
not sure exactly which issue you meen
Vordox: 13 billion
yes
few layering issues with tf2, all of them windows problems tbh
Jageman: I said out of it's age, not current gae.
age*
When i click on another program. Tf2 still stays over it
no time :/
Deacon
I got the 3ds version
Vordox: the expansion from the big bang is not the cause of the current expansion.
who has a pie?
yo PrincessCelestia!
yes
deacon, what is it?
oh
Vordox: if it was, the energy would still be present
Like instead of pressing 'alt-tab', I actually have to click 'minimize'
Derpy is best Captain Falcon
oh, nothing PrincessCelestia
ill get to it when I can
yeah, just keep something else ontop while it loads
Vordox: and our planet would not have cooled
ok
might not be til next month..
i found out how to get back
you'll notice me doing that during streams
Hmm, alright.
allways tab to the chat
oh ok then
Jageman: Proof?
hey PrincessCelestia
Ah, i see :o
Yes, soarin?
gg
11,02gg :)
Hi
Vordox: background energy maps of deep space
11,02LAST MATCH
Thanks, becuz its quite annoying to have it on top :L
PrincessCelestia Implying you bypassed a ban?
Evenin' BronyState. :)
hi AdamTheDuck :3
Hi, AdamTheDuck. :)
I'm done role playing
Vordox: their are small traces of the radiation
-_-
hi AdamTheDuck
I like the name
there wasn't a ban killerpony7733
hi AdamTheDuck
Vordox: we are using them to map the history of the universe
Fuuuuuuu
I keep forgetting I enforced my nick ;~;
Deacon I just thought it sounded like that
Jageman: Then how do you put this in conjecture with Dark Energy?
Vordox: dark energy is just a label for energy that we don't understand yet
OFF TO OMEGLE
WHO HAS PIE?!?!
bye everypony <3
seeya PrincessCelestia :D
bye PrincessCelestia
PIE?where?!
Jageman: I thought it was the term for explaining the expansion of the universe.
11,02Later PrincessCelestia :)
COOKIEZ 030
Pi = 3.14159265
Bye PrincessCelestia
And is one of the main causes of that effect.
Vordox: the universe is expanding at a faster rate every second
i do soarin
bye PrincessCelestia
before i go, ill give it to you
Vordox: inorder for it to expand faster energy has to be applied
Err. Okay. Busy.
good punch
PrincessCelestia, Give what to who?
Vordox: we don't know where the energy is comeing fomr
BYE EVERYPONY HERE'S YOUR PIE, SOARIN?
Vordox: from*
BYE EVERYPONY <3
Vordox: so we call it dark energy
oh thanks PrincessCelestia! YOURE THE BEST PRINCESS
So how do people play this online?
you and those fucking fans
Jageman: I see, well, we don't know, so why are we talking about something we don't know?
Vordox: because we can measure its effects on reality
Vordox: so it exsists, we just don't have a working theory on why or where it comes from
gg
11,02Moo :)
Vordox: same with dark matter
nyeh :/
Jageman: This is way above my head.
But I sitll believe in the whole debacle of the Big Crunch.
Vordox: the observable universe has more gravity than can be visually messured
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_model
Vordox: the cyclic model is not currently supported be observations
I'm the 'h' to the 'u' to the 'g' to the 's', and if you want a hug I'll make sure you get attacked, I'm hugalicious
/me runs and hides from angry mobs
/me boops AssaultWithEmbraces :3
AssaultWithEmbraces: ...daaaaw <3
AssaultWithEmbraces cute, just....cute
oh my...WiiU
^
hey Cynder
/me waves from her hiding place slowly
0,14ever notice the Wii U's name is also the name of a police sound
Wiiiiiiiiii yooooooooo
0,14WIIIIIIIIIII UUUUUUUUUUUUU WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII UUUUUUUUUUUU
11,02Yesh :3
/me assaults AssaultWithEmbraces with an embrace
:D
Vordox: It may be possible that the universe will collapes in on itself, but current observations show that to be unlikely.
11,02Note how this stream is brought to you in 720p~
Oh, hey RainbowDashie
...
SaxyPretender, oh shit it's the fuzz! Hide the ponies!
hi cynder
Hi, Soarin, hows it going?
only 720?
Vordox: are you still there?
It's good
13pfff
Wii U is also Ling Ling's favorite console
131080 or go home
?
720p?
11,02:<

Shizuka, 4K?
It good, RainbowDashie, Wut 'bout you?
2160 or bust
6How are you both doing?
Im good Soar
SB, you do realize your embed doesn't work, right?
Jageman: Not even close to breaking, just reading up about the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Expansion of the universe and other things
kirzstryfe, 240p
Vordox: good
/me embraces for the inevitable
11,02kirzstryfe: What's wrong with it?
im ok
240p for true nostalgia
not allowed to load justin.tv in a frame
real men use 240p
kirzstryfe: Already told him that 1 day ago
damn, that robot guy reminds me of F.L.U.D.D.
11,02You need to load the link that appears in the embed
Vordox: anyway, like i said, the unless something drastic and unexplainable happens, the universe will either go into big rip, or more likely, big freeze
I'm hitting the hay. G'night everypony!
nighty Canadian_Brony!
Night, Canadian_Brony. :)
Goodnight Canadian_Brony :)
Thank you NewSuperBronyU for the always awesome stream *yawn* n'stuff..
AJIsAwesome, do you ever sleep? :$
Canadian_Brony: Night
AdamTheDuck: Yes. :D
/me throws a pillow at AJIsAwesome :$
AdamTheDuck: No, he is a vampire. He does not sleep.
/me is smacked by the pillow :D
I understand that SB, but don't you think there's an issue using an embed that actively redirects people off of the site?
AdamTheDuck: He only pretends to sleep.
Kirz: Naaaaaaah.
11,02I don't see the issue with it...it's the only way I can stream my consoles with ease.
back
What is with the justin.tv?
Back again
yo Jageman
Welcome back Jageman
13sb you're sending people away from bronystate to watch
<===== Dumb enough to click on the stream
wait, people having problems opening the stream on bronystate?
I is
Which is probably for the best.
Given the chat of late.
try and click the play button, worked for me
im ok too
tried
no good
just been super busy
just opened a new window
Oh, SB got his own emblem?
Also, I'm back
11,02Sorry, I'm tired of being complained at about my stream being off the site. I'm going to end stream here.
hey HoodyNinja
I don't mined
Well, thanks for streaming for us NewSuperBronyU. :)
Ok then NewSuperBronyU. Thanks for the stream.
aaaw NewSuperBronyU i was seeing it just fine :(
mind*
well, it would work on site if you press play
6:O
wb HoodyNinja
oh and welcome back HoodyNinja
but oh well
doesn't work for everyone son
Deacon: not for me, it just says loading the justin.tv player in a frame is not allowed
are you clicking the stream itself?
Deacon: no, if i do that it redirects me offsite.
oh well, nothing's streaming anyways
Buffershow! \:3/
Oh wait
this embeded doesn't have a buffer ring ;~;
I just don't know what went wrong.
ermagerd stahp complaining Adam
gawd
;~;
0,14but how will we ever find out what happens next on All My Circles?
/me runs away crying
Saxy
pls go
SaxyPretender
I can predict that things will turn out all right.
/me gives AdamTheDuck a hug.
just listen for the bird, for it is the word
0,14OI
:3
Meanwhile: No you can't, you can only make things worse
Dang it I turn away I should have been here to give the link to the other site
/me then gives AdamTheDuck a chocolate chip cookie
HoodyNinja: http://i.imgur.com/vFgdz.png
/me nibbles on cookie :3
SaxyPretender, All My Circles? That still comes on?
:3
0,14of course, AssaultWithEmbraces
0,14it's our longest running show
Who watches that?
All My Circles, ew.
I prefer As The Buffer Turns
I don't get what the issue was with this, all people had to do was press play instead of going off to watch it off site
I stopped watching after season 5
/me then walks away, having helped a fellow brony.
0,14also
0,14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOyo7JD7hjo
NewSuperBronyU: Please tell me you'll try again later will you?
I wish PSY would make another catchy song...
wait MC Hammer is still a thing?
0,14I think so
Eh, whatevs
11,02J_E_Smith71: Can't unless I basically did it off the site.
I only liked one song from him.
/me I usually don't colour but when I do I think outside the tetradodecahedron
Now my sister, yesss.....
I only KNOW one song from him
0,14everyone does
0,14:3
And thats the one about time telling hammers
AdamTheDuck: Do you feel better now?
Yep
same
That awkwardly dancing audience
NewSuperBronyU: I don't understand though, I had no problem with running the embed without leaving Bronystate. Pushing the play button allowed the embed to work and let me watch it here
^
11,02btw, Desert Bus for Hope is happening now if any of you are interested. They're trying to raise money to be donated to charity.
AdamTheDuck: I hope so, that cookie was laced with sedatives.
My embed failed to play on cue
NewSuperBronyU: Link please? :)
11,02J_E_Smith71: It's a mixed bag, some people get it to work while others don't.
I don't have any money ;~;
11,02http://desertbus.org/
NewSuperBronyU: It's excellent.
6Gtg..See ya!
What an excellent Dio
o.o
/me goes... To... zzzzz
SaxyPretender, that link is awesome and I think I'll show my sister that when she gets home
Assuming I haven't clared my history by then.
/me eats Duckie's zzzz's
0,14it's so beautiful
/me sneaks up to AdamTheDuck and steals walet
Just as planed
planned*
/me wallet is already murdered by Steam
NewSuperBronyU: This said, I'm glad the guy who won the Rainbow Dash plush was the guy who won it.
well...
aww man
/me wishes she knew how to dance
Those sedatives were not cheap either
I used to dance
But still, $2275.02, just to beat the eBay auction by $0.02
you and me both AssaultWithEmbraces :(
I know how to dance, it is fun
how did gangam style get 700 million views on youtube?
Funny part is I'm black so it's assumed that "I know how to dane"
dance*
Jageman meme status!
NewSuperBronyU: This one: http://desertbus.org/live-auction/216
Expecially slow dancing.
Can you dance well?
The one I wanted to win
Deacon: but 700 million?
Wait wait wait
My parents didn't think I would make it through ROTC in high school because I was so uncoordinated
What do you think?
2k $ for a plushie?
Jageman once again, meme status
HoodyNinja: They sold a sword for $10,000 earlier.
havent seen her in a few days
I hope that was for a charity auction
/me slow dances with Jaymoo .-.
764,054,381 views for a meme is rediculous
wat.
No its not
Its perfect
HoodyNinja: YOu're thinking of 2 grand, not 2K.
me neither
NewSuperBronyU:
New
AJIsAwesome: I can't tell it you're making a joke or not
NewSuperBronyU:
Hello?
STOP MOCKING ME
2k = 2000
AssaultWithEmbraces: i think you dance well...well better than me anyway :D
HoodyNinja: I'm just joshing, silleh. :3
Can't you take a joke? :D
NewSuperBronyU:
Hello?
I can take jokes
NocturnalBlade, have you seen me attempt to dance? Don't answer that.
I just took yours
i need to talk to NewSuperBronyU
Now you can't use it, it's my joke
>:3
gangam style is going to take biebers place as most viewed video
:<
AssaultWithEmbraces: umm...oh fine i wont...but you know the answer ;)
E²=(mc²)²=(pc)²
It hasn't yet?
Hello?
NocturnalBlade, that counts as answering so I send you to the sun.
0,14Yeah?
If only people could pronounce "Gangnam" properly.
https://www.youtube.com/charts/videos_views?t=a
Noooooo :(
Is it gung num?
Like that?
Kong-nom
SaxyPretender: it's been three days now....im sure they would see my apeal
Or gong num
It's easy
That was horrible.
Not even gonna lie.
The G is pronounced like a soft/Russian K.
Party rock anthem is 5th
The G is pronounced like a 5

Party Rock anthem?...
0,14did you see what SB wrote earlier? if not, you have to wait 3 days until we reach a decision
/me doesn't want to live anymore
His attempt at joking with Gangnam.
gangnam is 2nd, but moving very fast
SaxyPretender: but it HAS been 3 days
ah
0,14Tough.

Flubba dubba.
AssaultWithEmbraces: DO IT ANYWAY
/me dances like a silleh filleh :D
SaxyPretender:
Wow, never had tf2 crash on me before O_o
Jageman: like i said, one of the worst songs ever created. i have a hard time calling it a song
HoodyNinja, but it's a stream. I'd get kicked.
/me gives AdamTheDuck a cupcake
omg the fun ^_^
You could've claimed you didn't know a stream was on!
Think, man, think!
Someone tell me what i'm looking at?
Man?
twilight_sprinkle: I thought you were refering to the bieber song
Retard of the year.
BlaxBlain: fun?
SaxyPretender:
SAXY
0,14...
Jmo: ?
crashes for me, usually during map transitions if it does
Not you.
Who?
SaxyPretender: do I have to wait 3 more days?
Jaymoo.
HoodyNinja, tried that. Failed.
Jageman: "is always going to be ne of the worst songs ever created" i was referring to both
Meanwhile, wat.
0,14First off, continously pinging me is not a good attitude to display while waiting for your appeal.
Pls go.

SaxyPretender: sorry........
Gud.
twilight_sprinkle: oh, i just got that.
I get impatient
/me feels stupid again.

ill try
so..... do I have to wait 3 more days?
Jageman: but yeah dont worry about it :P
twilight_sprinkle: Baka?
0,14We have started reviewing it today. So yes, you will have to wait.
*sigh*
twilight_sprinkle: lol
Jageman: its japanese for idiot, but im joking of course :P
O_O
I have a feeling spriggles don't like pop
twilight_sprinkle: why are you calling me a fool?
O~O

Sorry havent heard of it :/
oh hai HoodyNinja.
really tiny con in wisconsin dells
cheese is awsum
Oh hai
best food
...
I can't pause this stream
yep
how was it?
or mute it
I don't expect many people to have heard of it; I never had until last year
Cheese is not a very effective weapon.
WHAT SORCERY IS THIS
not a stream
flash animation
Why can I not turn the volume down D:
It was alright, got a lot of pictures taken of our group
its pinkie, shes taken over, theres no escape now
Then why is it in the stream box?
and thats why didnt refresh embed
God save the stream
and a couple people hugged me :P
twilight_sprinkle: I don't know to be happy or scared
HoodyNinja: is a scripted animation
HoodyNinja: both
i have it turned off
no good panels this year though =/ and I don't know enough about anime to understand most of the costumes and merchandise
the music got annoying
How?
music is epic
haha awesome
press the popout button
How does turn off!!!!
Meh I don't want to turn it off
Thank you
then close it
BlaxBlain, it's Pinkie.
not that though
yeah its a neat idea, but could really i use a vlume control option
One does not simply turn off a stream full of Pinkie
Bstate background music
Genious
>genious
hoodi pls
I misspelled it, din't I
I want "Lalalalalalala" as BrownieStaet's background music. ;~;
naw >_>
twilight_sprinkle: your computer does not have individual volume control for different progams?
who put that as the stream?
Geneous
Geneeus
Djiiniyus
you gotta ask Amu on that
Genieus
she will know :)
;~;
genis
wat
Jageman: yeah but i would have to mute all of chrome, i dont know if it will work if i separate it into a new window
You dressed up?
genius?
Genous
genesis
JENGA!
CONGA
/me forms a conga
coconut
/me gets in the conga line
/me joins conga
coa-coa butter
twilight_sprinkle: i have an app that controls the volume for the tabs separately
cats!
Yeah, I'll have to get a picture
Jageman: can I have?
Chocolate
Jageman: oh nice, whats it called?
i think it only works on firefox though
Or maybe someone posted theirs online somewhere
oh, well ill have to search something like that for chrome
and its prone to crashing sometimes
Did my stream load up properly?
SpadeMagnes[R], yes it did. Why?
Im getting a bunch of pinkie pies...I hope thats normal
Yep that's normal
If your stream is FUN then it's working as intended.
13FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
XD
Like everything ever released by Blizzard.
lol
I love Blizzard says stuff is working as intended when it sometimes isnt, I find it funny
It never ends.
It isn't supposed too
Now to open up 300 Pinkie desktop ponies to complete this.
I just did a popout of the chat
That wouldn't be fun
i went looking for it, but i guess in uninstalled it.
AdamTheDuck, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AdamTheDuck: inb4 crash
You trying to destroy computers that way
Needs more pinkie pie
AdamTheDuck: Inb4 cra...
600 pinkie pies
DO IT
OneTrickPony: Damn you to hell
HoodyNinja: XD
I stand by "Never enough Pinkie" but I also stand by having a working hard drive, too
ok
So that makes no sense!
Try 300 of all the mane 6
inb4 a twi appears in the embed and starts killing off the pinkies
Result? Profit
good evening everypony
i think my graphics card could handle 300 pinkies but my main processor might have some trouble
/me covers twilight_sprinkle's mouth "Shhhh, don't tempt them"
Step 1 Open Desktop Ponies
hiya PrincessLuna
Step 2 Make 300 Pinkies
I have tons of homework to do now though :(
Step 4 Profit
AssaultWithEmbraces: heh i wonder if someone will make a game for it
I put it off and it turns out it was a lot more than I expected
hoi PrincessLuna
x.x I hate that when it happens
twilight_sprinkle, inb4 someone is making it right now. You see how fast Cadence Toss came out.
Ive had some days where I stayed up almost all night to get it done
So did the stream crash or something?
This is awfully quiet for bronystate standards.
Whoever has the most Pinkies on their desktop without their computer crashing wins
ITS 12 O FUCKING CLOCK
i found an extention for chome that lets you mute individual tabs
AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, their probably will be a game like it
SMART PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING
i.http://imgur.com/S2hhi
I think you'll find according to my clock it's 6:32.
AssaultWithEmbraces: that's trivial.
its called mutetab
HoodyNinja: There could also be insomniacs.
Bigcheese, pfft how
Its 12:32 here
bitch please, i got a physics quiz in 7 hours, i aint sleepin yet
Fuck sleep
http://i.imgur.com/S2hhi.jpg *
Damn you logic
1:32am
Worth it.
Sleep is for wusses
Watch out, children are cool cause they're staying up.
AssaultWithEmbraces: raster. Use a single frame buffer and keep rastering more on.
Meanwhile: You're not on 'Murikin time, do'nt count
I actually have stayed up all night many times
Finite memory!
needs 20% more pinkie
I live in Murkia
Thanks to my evil major
HoodyNinja: I'm on English time, so I'm automatically right.
AdamTheDuck: how many fps are you running now?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Murkia?
I have no idea Jageman...
Meanwhile: Does that make me left?
HoodyNinja: Yes.
SWEET!
/me is now oot link
As in, left in the dark.
its 2334 here, im going to bed
Still fucking left
Damnit Pinkie
Two wrongs dont make a right, two lefts make a right
Or, left behind.
stay outta my IRC chat :D
/me throws a car
Left 4 Dead.
btw: Im a time traveler from the future.
Doctor?
Oh really?
Whoa who's throwing cars?
/me plays the Song of Time
the year 2015
I thought you would be from the past
Did you download that, mister?
wow, my computer is slow today for no apparent reason =/
/me throws the chatroom into the air
I hate when that happens
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
/me lands on SpadeMagnes[R]
Hmm
Ow
300 Pinkies only use about 20% of my CPU
i just wanted to tell everyone that, nothing really changes in 3 years
so don't worry
AdamTheDuck: You actually fucking did it?
Wait, where do I get the Desktop ponies? the site is down
SpadeMagnes[R], http://i.imgur.com/S2hhi.jpg
AdamTheDuck: so you could easily put 1000 pinkies in there
I assume so, but the max is 300
Da fauq kind of computer are you using mang?
AssaultWithEmbraces: I think it's been shut down.
Damn
SpadeMagnes[R], just a custom one I built a year or two ago .-.
there a stream?
i have the file and could give you a copy AssaultWithEmbraces
Technically, yes.
Oh, mlp is scheduled to be canceled in 2016 though
hmm it keeps reaking on me
/me slaps Jageman
reaking?
Streaking?
Why's it streaking on you?
leaking?
Whats leaking?
/me rubs slap mark
owww
you tell me, arent you the pro streaker?
SpadeMagnes[R]: what was that for?
NocturnalBlade, GIMME. NOW.
So where exactly are all these Pinkies going?
SpadeMagnes[R]: I came back in time to warn you, and you slap me.
SpadeMagnes[R], to the fourth wall?
So is Tom the permament guardian of the mirror pool now?
AssaultWithEmbraces: how do i do that XD
Its true. I invented a time machine in 2015 to come back and warn everyone that mlp is scheduled to be canceled in 2016 though
NocturnalBlade, we have this thing called e-mail

Bye, Jageman. :)
Oh God

AssaultWithEmbraces: It already did
I am vengence, I am the night, I am JAGEMAN.
AdamTheDuck: Has it worked?
HoodyNinja: did u died?
/me steals Jageman's J
hey
Only took ~35% of my gpu .-.
I died but I'm alright
But it the Pinkies lagged like crazy
everything else was running fine
AdamTheDuck: Pics or didnt happen
/me chases HoodyNinja
/me deadrings away
Anyone got a spare J?
Hoody took mine
Forget it, ill just buy a new one. later
maybe it requires more tape.

then take his, Jageman
/me givs Jageman a J
not many people with Js here
Excuse my slow Australian internet... ._.
Shut up Brad_ :P
:P
Yeah, I'm probably going to restart eventually
Is doing an austrailian accent racist? Because now I feel racist
HoodyNinja, depends on what you view "Australian" to be
I usually just have to do a system restore when it does this though because that doesn't fix it
Gday mate?
Because only 10% of us speak with a broad sociolect .-.
Talking like the guy from the outback commercials
Croikey mate dingoes mate dingoes don't let your baby near a dingo mate it'll eat yer baby mate croikey.
Huh... Well this was ingame mid-fight crash xD

Gaaah
Does Skype seem to be freezing or not responding for anyone a lot these days?
00,10you know at that shallow an entry angle it should bounce off the atmosphear
Nope
home safely :3
00,02Sumica, at those speeds probably not
i get messages late on skype sometimes.. that count?
AssaultWithEmbraces: a couple of times...why?
Open chute....
Skype seems to dislike me. That's why I use it on my phone whenever I can.
00,10you meen at orbital speeds?
less than 4km....
3km...
AssaultWithEmbraces: ah
2km...
00,02Sumica, bout 3.6km/s when hitting the atmosphere
1km... o.o;
Whew.
00,10oh right I need to try KPS now that I have enough ram to support ships that I build
now its all blank.. my tools not doing anything..
not drawings.. i want to draw on paintchat
Oooh, Bastion.
Bastion is good.
00,10mind you I should say "ships"
00,10cause realy they are more like ICBM's
00,10ever get warp couplers to work Phase4?
00,02Sumica, icbm is best ship
00,02Sumica, i did, but they dont work the way i want them to
i only heard borderlands when i hear this song
00,02plus i suck at orbital randevus
00,02i cannot spell french words
00,10ahh
rendezvous or somthing tricky like that
00,10like I am one to call some one else out on spelling
00,02could try for an eve flight again
00,02this should be capable of it
00,10I was bummed out the game cant handle attaching things on two points
00,02i wish the mirroring had more options
00,10so I cant realy build the tug type chassie that I want
00,02would like to attach even more rockets but i cant mirror two onto 6
did someone m+ in here or are just you two talking...
nope it's jsut hem talking
00,10bleeeh guess i need to get 17.1
@_@ so many colours
00,10hard to belive it was only 13 when we started playing
blue bluegreen
00,107,8 this better?
00,02i've got to get a copy of 0.15
Sumica: no
Sumica: yes
00,02want to fly tri again
00,02tri was a good rocket
Sumica: you should use those colours all the time!
00,10I still remember every one doubting the ToP
.-.
00,10that thing will never fly
More thrusters!
00,10and then I broke solar orbit with it
00,02XD
00,02ikr
00,02that was another good rocket
Sumica: you showed them!
what is the game playing in the live stream?
00,10it was insane
00,10Kerbal space program
00,02what the hay, lets try launch from here
ok ty
00,10wow
00,10so many couplers
00,02it explodes if i dont have them
good night everybody ^_^ have fun
00,10well yeah it's half off the pad
00,02bout 1K tonns
00,02on launch
Night Star
Goodnight DeathStar
00,10all that fule to put one guy in space
00,02yup
/me dances off to bed
00,10cross feed fuel?
00,02and hopefully get him back
00,02Sumica, yeah, drains in a wierd circular patern
go justice
i haven't listend to them in a while
00,02bit more efficent than dropping the entire outer stage
00,10that the mecha Jeb?
00,10on the left?
00,02havent even broken atmosphere and already used 400 tonns of fuel
00,02Sumica, yeah
00,10Top was like that too though
00,02this rocket goes up
00,02far as i know thats all its capable of
nite deathstar
00,10only did like 40 Mp/s
00,02this seperating is a bit risky
00,02i've had this explode more than once
00,10should use sep boosters
00,02exaust causes problems
00,02seems to be going up nicely
00,10I need to see if I can get my TSO files to play
00,02Sumica, tiberium symphony orchestra?
00,10Trans-Siberian Orchestra
00,02close enough
00,02Sumica, i got the album in flac
soemone ruined my vinyl ;_;
00,02FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
00,10Same here
00,02my center stage has legged it
00,10but it's some crazy nonstandared file time
00,10so I have to put a plugin to my winamp
00,02well that is anoying
00,02this rocket was all set to make it to eve
00,02and then it broke
00,02one more launch
00,02if i cant make this one work then i'll either stop streaming or do something else
00,02where'd everyone go?
Exam studies :3

I love this song! =D
00,02ohai Gold_Gemona
00,10......patcher why you no patch
BAHAHA! The Digimon movie soundtrack!
>..
>.>
00,10oh wait.
I recognized the song from the soundtrack, but I didn't think that's what you were playing!
00,10I see the patcher is not a smart program
00,10it has to be actaly be unziped to the folder
That's awesome!
Doing KSP patcher, sumi?
00,10yeah
:D I c what u did thar Gold_Gemona
00,02Gold_Gemona, XD
00,10Same here
00,02seems we're headed to jool
So I don't remember asking you Gold_Gemona, wasn't last episode THE BOMB? :$
00,02Sumica, want to stream?
00,02i'm going to be reading documentation while ksp does stuff
00,10if you have had enough
00,02not particuarly interesting
The only thing that disappointed me about the Digmon movie was that it was actually three specials that were smashed together to make one loosely-related narrative.
00,02Gold_Gemona, ikr!
00,10yeah I will set up
00,02Sumica, k, bug me when you're ready
00,10probably just gonna play some towns
I would love to have seen those specials dubbed but not edited, ya know?
Hey, Digimon!~ Hey, Digimon!~
:|
00,02Gold_Gemona, i used to be really confused by the opening
00,02what they were saying and what was happening seemd to have no relation
yeah
00,02wonder why these 3 songs ended up in a row
00,02o i c
I knew when I watched it that they'd added a LOT of unnecessary narration.
What happens here now?
/me sings along with the music like a dork
All my nostalgia, don't mind me. :P
00,10ok Phase4
00,02k
00,02i'll wait for this song to finihs
00,02finish'
Gold_Gemona: NEEEEEEERD :D
:D
MadSurge: Damn skippy
00,02^
00,10oki
Gold_Gemona: true Pinkie fans say no to snowclone fun!
00,02Sumica, k

The portraits Pinkie used to quizz the clones made me laugh too , also Fluttershutter and applejohn
Applejohn :D
Nuuuu Blaze666! Don't eat me. I don't taste good. D:
/me spits
I briefly though this was Dwarf Fortress
00,02pathing
00,02aparently not so easy
00,02i was thinking, looked a bit like dwarf fortress
AdamTheDuck: he was strong and serprisingly fast
00,02wow
00,02idiot ai
aight im back yall
So what actually is this called?
therainbowvortex, most boxers are, speed is more important than power
Mutterguy, name of the game?
yes?
It's Towns.
00,02NO PIE FOR YOU
AdamTheDuck: yeah my jaw hurts so bad right now
cow
00,02are those cows running generators?
therainbowvortex, your jaws shouldn't be hurting that bad if you kept your arms up :P
cows in the house?
00,02like hampster wheel power but with cows
AdamTheDuck: i did the best i could
Cow ontop of wall, lol
Brb, rebooting because something is eating up all my bandwith
If there's one thing I learnt, never let both your arms down therainbowvortex :P
Keep at least one protecting your face.
Yay People!
Hello All!
AdamTheDuck: it was kinda cool i went for a punch and so did he and well he conected and i didnt
Ohai SafariMonkey
Well at least this channel has some activity. :)
Hi AdamTheDuck! :)
therainbowvortex, were you punching correctly? I know I didn't punch properly when in my first fihgt
00,02Sumica, store the grain and eat beef?
AdamTheDuck: i think i was
Hey Phase4! :)
00,02ohai SafariMonkey
There's no way to change the priorities? O_o
00,02Sumica, dwarf fortress allowed you to designate dwarfs to tasks, doesnt this game have an equivilent?
Gold_Gemona: i have seen you in ages
ohai therainbowvortex :D
00,02yeah, really needs some way to force tasks
Gold_Gemona: hmm somthing is diferent
00,02the invisible pidgeon who pushes the buttons
Well depends, was he generally taller than you?
Oh frig. It yped my name wrong. XP
typed
00,02have to be carefull of those ypos
WHY DID NOBODY SAY ANYTHING?! :[
Gold_Gemona, I didn't even noticed XD
notice*
00,02Gold_Gemona, i didnt notice either XD
Gold_Gemona: i just did
00,02i tab complete so the spelling was autocorrected
So thar
Dolt_Gemona ^^
P:
therainbowvortex, Well depends, was he generally taller than you?
00,02did wonder why it was green, normally your nick is red but the typo was green
or similar height?
I think Dorfs are smarter. In Urist we trust!
Gold_Demona: People use intentional mutations of their names on here all the time
00,02cows cows cows cows cows cows
AdamTheDuck: yeah like a bit smaller then double my hight
You can't task individuals with jobs? that seems silly...
Phase4: Nick-seeded colours? :D
00,02SafariMonkey, yeah
It's pretty sad to typo your own name and not notice until somebody points it out. :P
Kill ALL THE COWS!
00,02XD the guy just picks up the entire pig
I WANT STEAK!
00,02and the cows too XD
00,02Yoink
cows
Gold_Demona: its okay one time i left out the t in vortex
Best milking method
And I'm back!
WB MadSurge! :)
Fresh squeezed cowjuice
Welcome back MadSurge
AdamTheDuck: reall i was screwed
Gold_Demona: aww no more Gemona
Because Mr urist the butcher butchers the god damn cow. It's his job. So long as he isn't being chased by goblins or boozing it up in the Hall
therainbowvortex, don't think that
00,02to be fair if they were smart your job would be pointless
therainbowvortex, you think that, and you already lost the fight.
AdamTheDuck: their was no way i could of bet him if he wanted to he could pick me up and trow me acroos the room
00,02micro managing with a macro managing interface is anoying yeah
MadSurge: Apparenly it was just a typo. :P
00,02XD
SafariMonkey: :|
lol
drown the warlock XD
00,02drown all the things
00,02punch trees, aquire wood
pantsless hero is best hero

00,02next time i play a bard in d&d i'm calling it nopants
Just look at Ghouls and Ghosts. :P
Ohmai
Punchwood. No kidding. :D
/me is thoroughly confused, due to stream being filtered in school
"Have at the, Monster! I shall punch you with my wood! That's why they call me Punchwood!"
SafariMonkey, go back to your edumaction :P
Sumica if you dig a hole into the 6th floor... why not drown the 7th floor?
AdamTheDuck: I'm going, I'm going
bye then
.-. Bye SafariMonkey

Hello pony_5586! Are you new?
Go home cow. You're drunk.

pony_5586: have you read the rules?
How nice game it is!
of course
well at least they don't run mushroom beer...
*run on

00,10well that's a new one
00,02clearly that cow was closest
He had to get that one special cow. >_>
Is this 2D or 3D?
It was THE cow! The most important cow in the whole wide world! D:
No other cows will do!
Gold_Demona: COW LAUNCHED
How many bones could a Towns man throw if a Towns man go chuck bones?
Sumica I think they've coded a dwarf's anatomy with object oriented language. Your dwarf can specifically die from a bleeding liver
I don't even know what a wood chuck is :s
Phase4 sleep
00,02streams derping here, probably the microwave
00,02REALLY need to get my wireless card swapped out
Microwaves, HOW DO THEY WORK
MadSurge: A woodchuck kinda looks like a gopher. :P
Aaaah
So it's a rodent?
Carve them and sell them. Bone crafts are best trinkets.
00,02combat badgers?
As we lie if Field of Bone!~
:P
Live from Croydon! it's....Bone wall!

00,02Mutterguy, i'd probably drink myself to death if i had to see twilight
I don't blame him
This game looks minecraft!
00,02[KOR]Cocoa, actually looks more like transport tycoon to me
00,02Sumica, might have to remove that stone wall
00,02they're confuz
is there an ultimate goal to this game ?
00,02Sumica, south of the corner
Don't think so TrixieMuffins
00,02yeah, i have no idea why they're doing that either
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Boast Busters Anniversary Day!
lol A Sethisto post all about Trixie. Who's shocked? :D
Anniversary for Boast Busters?! NO, forget that episode! Burn it!
Trixie is worst pony
MadSurge: No. Diamond Tiara is worst pony
00,02too bad you cant build paths
00,02some kind of hint to the ai would be nice
MadSurge: This is true. I'd say that makes Trixie most overrated pony, not worst.
I guess you're right
...

http://derpy.me/gfIDc Big Mac's expression supports the claim.
lol Eeyup
Enoeyup
Alchemist: Big Mac is the strongest, but he fears his sister's anger
MadSurge: and I bet he should
Alchemist: angry women are scary
Especially women as strong as AJ

It's no fun to go alone! Here, take this! http://derpy.me/Iy0RC
I found episode 3 quite amusing, dunno what you think.
When RD brought that Pinkie in, all I could picture was a bunch of : ( on the ground where they left.
:C
http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3360-1330671248679.gif
Alchemist: it was amazing, I could not type on chat because I was too busy laughing :D
whoops wrong post
It's my favorite Pinkie-centered episode.
Alchemist: Yep, pretty amusing. Nice to see another exploration of a classic scifi theme, like "it's about time"
i think there shuld of been a simultanius pinkie sneze
Gold_Demona: even people who hate Pinkie liked it
ugh i hate you sometimes derpy.me
MadSurge: reading some comments on EqD I saw that many people are getting disillusioned (for lack of a better word), because they try to look too deep into the show...
meh i guess you guys dont get to see fluttershy pics
Alchemist: you have no idea of the discussion about Pinkie clones on the Round Stable... :D
RoboGerbil: I saw the wingboner one :D
yeh i had more but my link shortener is giving me errors
i got food!
and cookies xD
I like the music, sumi. :3
RoboGerbil: I have to manually reload derpy.me after each link or else it wont shorten uit.
*it
Alchemist: still, most saw it for what it was, a fun episode :D
why
WHY
IT'S STILL NOVEMBER
cant we save it for after thanksgiving?
please
MadSurge: slapstick comedy with Pinkie is a great mix :)
Halloween*
Gold_Demona: enough religious festivities here, I'll skip the turkey thanks
Alchemist: also, Pinkie is not a shallow fun hog
That was the best part for me
i had someone with lights up and on at halloween
old person finally agrees with me
Gold_Demona: Xmas and new year feasts :Q
i noticed..
00,02Sumica, are your villagers happy yet?
there are no thanksgiving songs D:
We don't feast for New Years over here. Just lots and lots of alcahol.
MadSurge: we already knew that, but I imagine sometimes its hard to write a good story for a certain character (like AJ).
Booze everywhere
gold do i have to wait till im 21? ;_;
wat is this?
aniderp: not if you are from europe :)
Gold_Demona: we eat pork leg with lentils
00,02Sumica, can you build any entertainment?
Ew Lentils. ><
:\
00,02seems like you should be able to do that
Gold_Demona: also panettone, mmmmmmmmm
whiskey shot is nasty
00,02build more!
00,02we have the technology!
Gold_Demona: but I like all kinds of beans
baked beans
aniderp: dont some states have the 18 year limit? all have the 21 year old limit?
I love whiskey. Especially with Coke, :>
Ewww
speaking of.. i get some today!
baked beans
Alchemist: age 21 is federal law
I can't take mixed flavours
So chinese is horrible for me
i sipped whiskey shot before i shot it down..
I like the "hunter" =poor quality red wine + coke.
stupid idea
00,02they're not watching D:
You're not supposed to "sip" liquor. =/
00,02badgers are killing each other and no ones watching
What are those things doing?!
Oh no Blue badger breifly bailed but now he back!
You're supposed to rush it past your mouth and swallow it before you get the chance to taste it
Gold_Demona: what about beer?
i wanted to see the taste.. never sipping to tatse again
Same with beer
Alchemist: The only alcoholic beverage that's for sipping is stuff like wine and champagne
I only gulp down the ones I dont like. I like to taste the ones i like.
Like Metaxa.
aniderp: With things like liquor, the drink is for the aftertaste and affect. Not the flavor.
they were nice and gave me water
Gold_Demona: beats the purpose of drinks for me :| why drink something if it tastes like paint thinner
my mother dont know about that..
Or metaxa with ginger soda
was shaking after
MadSurge: to get drunk?
MadSurge: Not really. Things like schnapps taste better in the aftertaste than the actual taste.

that song..
nerves city
talking about shoes and alcohol; there is a custom here, I dont know if its universal.

Gold_Demona: that creepy shoes song D:
At weddings the guys have to drink champagne from the bride's high heels. Is that weird or what?
you play i getting nuttin for chirtsmas
Toast in a boot? The only reason I know about it is because of Hetalia. :P
MadSurge: Creepy? how?

Gold_Demona: shoes as a last wish? D: Somehow makes me think the kid will come back to get them anyway DX
MadSurge: Last wish?
kitchen haha
MadSurge: It was never implied that the mother asked for the shoes.
it was just her size
MadSurge: It's my understanding that the kid saw the shoes and wanted to buy them for his mother.
dose sips have pants now?
Still :( it's not what a Xmas song should be about
I want to hear this is Halloween
^
aniderp: For all we know, they could actually not be her size. Child perspective, you know. :P
/me puts hipster glasses
00,02^ CrystalPhoenix
00,02seems apropriate for some reason
but he put the shoes on her feet?
was more like slippers..

Theremin. right?

00,10it picks up em disterbences by you geting close to it
00,10it has a pair of antennas
You put your hands over the two rods, and it makes noise depending on the position of your hands.
00,10then it convers the disterbance to sound
you know the original Star trek theme. that features one as well. it's been aronud sinces the 50's

This version of the opera is gorgeous. :3
00,10yep i am riping this

I never got threw FF6 :(
And it's worth listening to the full half hour
Squallken: i got it on my tablet and im on some floating volcano or something
00,10I would love to see an opera preformed to this
00,10ZOMG lyrics!
To be honest, I've never finished ff6, but it's still one of my favorites.
the floating contant
Japanese lyrics, but lyrics nonetheless. :D
how can it be your favorite if youve neevr beat it?
I can never get too that damn place
RoboGerbil: I played it most of the way
Gold_Demona: how you know, you never beat it
00,10dont need it to be in english.
RoboGerbil: Cuz all I had left was Kefka's tower
00,10I know the lines by heart
RoboGerbil: Also, I've seen my husband beat it. :P
Japanese opera, never thought I'd hear that O_o
00,10this sounds so amazing
well i know i never really got attached to any of the characters in ff6
cuz every 10 mins theyd leave my party
I love King Edgar. He's my favorite. :>
Gold_Demona: Umaro is best berserker :D
I never used Umaro because I don't like characters I can't control. :<
Gold_Demona: I used him for the Fanatics Tower :)
00,10sabin and gao shadow and the knight whos name I cant recall at 5am
heh i used the feral kid with the monster powers a lot
My main team usually consisted of Edgar, Terra, Mog, and Gogo.
Or Sabin.
i used the knight chick too
Celes?
yeh
Celes is cool too. =)
00,10here we go
00,10celest bit
usaed the monk, celes, the feral kid and then whoever i was forced to use for the mission
dumb question: Kefka or Sepherroth?
00,10kefka
sephiroth was a dumb bad guy
^^^^^^^^^
^^^
I like Sephiroth as a villain, but Kefka is WAY more nuts.
he wasnt even really yhr bad guy either
Gold_Demona: too tranquil mad for my tastes :|
YES, people who pick Kefka :D
00,10they are both good but in a comparason kefka
And Kefka actually SUCCEEDED in destroying the world
00,10it got better
Gold_Demona: Kefka is a way better madman :D
Hellz yeh
That and Septheroth cant "laugh"
00,10well so did sephi
00,10recall how fucked things got when he did that shit in the north
ultamecia was best boss
Also in Dissidia, who else is reminded of Mark Hammil Joker a little bit when Kefka talks?
Kefka's laugh is best laugh.
Prance walking is best walking
thats it im kefka's laugh for a ringtone
00,10ok probably enough of this
im getting*
But it was almost to the part where the guy and the girl sing together. :<
:D THIS GUY
ow my ears
NICE :D
One winged angel? Pfeh, Kefka had SIX
In his final form, Sephiroth had like 7 :D

http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbq0z6eFgR1rpb34po1_500.png
Oh wait
00,107 was still fun
Sumica: 8 though was bad
00,10even if it gets more prase then games just as good
00,10yeah 8 was bad
ya sory for gat a ?
8 wasn't bad, but it was really boring. T^T
00,10they did some cool stuff with it
it had a kick but twist with cloud's mind being made up from different memories, sending him unto a crisis, but sadly that genius gets over shadowed by Aerith dying :[
forgot*
wat? i liked ff8, 9 was bad
00,10but I did not care for it
I liked 9
Gold_Demona: Seifer sucks so much he got owned by Gilgamesh
Oh, Final Fantasy 8?
I'm also in that very rare minority that actually likes 10-2
00,10realy thought what made the games good for me was the music
^
Nobuo Uematsu is a music god
Of course, music is important in a game
my favorite FF's (that ive beaten) are 4, 7, 8, and 10. FF's I want to beat is 3, and 6
are*
thank you
are*
np
00,10she plays rather good
I've only beaten 7, 9, and 10. But I've also played 5, 6, 8, and 12.
i never beat 12 either it got so repetative
5 is good, but I always get bored grinding all the jobs. =/
Gold_Demona: aye
12 is boring as hell.
00,10game play wise yeah
I've beaten 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12.
00,10liked the story thought
I had fun with 12
I couldn't get into 12's story, and the characters are very bland.
Gold_Demona: Gilgamesh and the general humour is what made 5 a good game for me :D
The gameplay was alright. I kinda liked the fighting system in 12.
Gold_Demona: get Final Fantasy Tactics games instead
I thought the characters to 12 were good, at least there conversations
i beat both ff tactics
MadSurge: No. I HATE that chessboard battle system.
:D
but tactics advance is only good for 1 playthrough
00,10I need to get back in to fft
00,10did not care for the rules of tatics advance
Gold_Demona: it's not as bad as Disgaea, you don't really need to grind
MadSurge: Never played Disgaea
i never beat disgaea
MadSurge: I just can't stand that chessboard system.
Sumica: Tactics Advance 2 is MUCH more lenient with the ru;es system
It's REALLY annoying.
Gold_Demona: I can see that
I tried playing an FFT game once, and got REALLY annoyed at the "judgement" system
it got to the point that i needed to grind 150 levels on each character just to advance the story a chapter
00,10the VG cats comic sums it up for me
woo VG cats
Sumica: link?
00,10http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=112
but i liked the near limitless advancement of characters in disgaea
la pucille tactics was a better game than disgaea
YAAAAAY
RoboGerbil: TOO limitless. The amount of grinding you need is terrible :|

Sumica: and ass
yay ponies :D

i gotta say this eps has the funniest moments of the entire series
Because Sumi feels like streaming ponies?
00,10dont play ponies, people bitch
00,10do play ponies people bitch
^
^^
^
Lel
Be coherent people
I have no complaints
whos bitching?
>.>
Sumica: just confused, not complaining. :)
:D
there just ain't no pleasin folk these days
orange frog!
Cohenrence? on the Internet?
tictictictictictictictictictictictictictictic
00,10I want a pinkie watch
00,10that dose that
^
or a pinkie alarm clock
00,10hmm i should pause this and play gak ad's
I'm sure if you look hard enough, someone already made one
NO!
I want to know more of Grandma Pie
Sumica: Grrrrrrrrrrrr
no gak ads! dont hurt us so!
00,10teee hee
lak?
double standards :(
00,10so dose this pond only work on mares?
Hehe
maybe.. o_O
00,10or is it a r63 pond
Naughty Sumica
fun fun fun
00,10if a stalion goes to use it.....
then he makes a mare
Sumica: it's that pond from Ranma 1/2 :D
Lyra`: Like Ranma? :O
and then my greatest fantasy, slef love :3
*self
off to dubble my fun
i wish it worked in revese, mare goes in, mare and stallion come out~
00,10so was any one else like wtf with the hidden shelf in the libary?
I find it scary to see two Lyra` s running around
Sumica: I was
this chat can barely contain one
naturesfury: :D
00,10I cant help but think that is forshadowing
Sumica: what?
Sumica: the world of equestria is more based around female culture. Due to their population being almost 80% female, they took prominance just as males have in human society. example, Best man, Best mare.
Sumica: If I had to make a guess, I'd say it kept the legend of the pool hidden so nopony uses it like Pinkie did and make chaos as a result
maybe gonna be used again for season finale?
dem walls
Sumica: Oh, that hidden book? Of course it totally is!
00,10each ep seems to have a stand out wtf moment
Morning, everyone.
morning AttackWithHugs
mornin~
00,10twi watching the results of the door on spike.
morning, AttackWithHugs :)
Sumica: I want more foreshadowing :$
Good Morning AttackWithHugs

/me hugs naturesfury, PonyBean, Sylandest, Obsidian, MadSurge, and Jmo
Hello AttackWithHugs :3
Also, morning Sumica
we've been hug! :D
/me huggles AttackWithHugs back
00,10morning
WAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
Dat Fluffeh.
I wonder what would happen if Discord ever use the mirror pool?
Dat Mojay
and then everything goes off
:3
/me attacks AttackWithHugs with a hug
00,10all this double double talk makes me want in & out
Squallken, chaos EVERYWHERE
too bad no rainbow dash in the pool....
oh god...10 discords?!
dat fun spam
/me huggles DoctoDoctorWho
Squallken: maybe it doesn't work on him
00,10so that's 13 pin kies
Squallken: besides, I think he already can split himself :D
Sumica: 13 precisely?
about 15 sumi
I think the mirror pool has no limits on "fun"
no, its 14
*13
i just counted 13
Some probably stayed behind so more could multiply
Why do they not show Pinkie's portrait though? :s
forest is populated with pinkies?
MadSurge: i was thinking that 2
ok, there's definitely more than 13...
00,10you know I get the feeling this ep came from an animater screwing around
Who are the other two?
the animators probably stopped counting here for mayhem'S sake
i see applefritter
but who is that stallion?
Dat pinkie didn't budge a bit :D
00,10more or less this is like my desktop the time I spauned 10 pinkies with desktopponies
And the stallion?
and Meadow Song
Sumica: :D
should i stay Lyra`, or go to BlackWidow?
and we probably just sw derpy'S backside
Sumica: did you notice there were two Doctor Whooves in that shot a moment ago?
*or Time Turner
is this a reference to something?
when he did the door thing
Foreshadowiiiiing~
No, has to be another apple
Sylandest: wouldnt be the first time he saw himself
Dark_Horst: fair point, hehe
but i get the feeling it was just the usual crows cloning
*crowd
The Pinkie is a spy!
Amish jokes :D
^
heh. that one just did the evil enchantress dance
whats fancypants doing in ponyville?
I once spawned 100 Pinkies with Desktop Ponies

MadSurge: possibly

00,10bet it would be easy to add the "
00,10Bet it would be easy to add the "fun" sound file to pinkie

Ohi Tank
Pinkiepocalypse
for a while I thought the clones were saying "mine"
pinkie abuse! D:
I loved that part! <3
You know what? I have another theory about this episode. Some of the Pinkie clones might have escaped.
Take this Pinkeh!

YAAAAAY
A fanfic reference

well now we know where all the duplicates in crowd scenes came from...
00,10and then inflation art got new insperation

RoboGerbil: nope

00,10you know that is a good water splash effect for a flash animation
RoboGerbil: but the clone came out. It was just a visual effect
The mirror pond, dear god the fanfics!

Kujo_Jojo: Ultramarines are too focused on protocol, the Blood angels, while having a different colour scheme, fit her much better what with their specialty being deep strike and assault.

05DoctoDoctorWho1: implying I have a sense of humor
"It burns!"
Gmod tiem

AssaultWithEmbraces: Indeed it is :).
Yaaay I love Wrek's Gmod time!
Gmod/SFM*
Wrek: those with a sense of humor tend to not kick when harmless fun is being poked.

This is playing TF2 in a nut shell.

Look closely at Heavy's head in the next scene.
She took Rarity's dew wings.

They got some VA's.
You see the crown/tiara on his head?
05heavies lines are rips
i meant they sound like the ones from the game
Oh Twilights element of harmony?
Lmao!
I mean element of magic
Those are some SKILLED VAs right there o___o
I applaud them.

Heavy awaken
This music sounds so sad.
Heavy.

Lowut

Is placing a sentry there actually possible in the map?
Used to be
it was
It got patched.
Ah.
dunno if it still is
LOL
aaand thats what happened
I wonder if there will be a 'reverse' MvM
I would really like to try and bomb the Machine Transporter thingy
RaveBrony, where you're invading Grey's turf and trying to drop a bomb in it?
Yeah, lol
How come there is Pinkie in most SFMs but not the rest of the mane6?
I'm guessing because Pinkie's usually a fan favorite?
Alchemist you are right.
:D
rayman ftw
Becuz Pinkie is the best to use for such random vids??
yay Rayman!
hey guys
it's easy to do obnoxious shit with pink obnoxious
Sup Chrysalis?
True, Pinkie IS random.
Hi, Chrysalis.
Or there is no good model for the others.
Hai Chrysalis :)
Hai Chrysalis
Must...get...Rayman Legends...
^
G'day Chrysalis
Hi Chrysalis
hey Chrysalis

Woo wrek can stream again :D
Toasty!
Fluttershy smoking? I QUIT!
i missed wrek art/game streams
Chrysalis: We all did.
Yup
ha ha rage quiter
Did he do any art streams? AFAIK, he just did SC2 for a while, then he started doing this instead.
next time we should hold a strike
Derpy Engie :).
How will that help Chrysalis \?
this is how most MvM games go :(
Sweet! i saw this on youtube!
Kandarihu: He did art on his livestream account, but that's as far as I know.
05mroe than you think DerpyMuffins
A strike?
AJIsAwesome, in the wee hours of the morning? ...Okay, it would probably be daylight in his timezone
this is also an annoying fact of MvM
This is so true.
if your an engineer and your halfway decent
everyone will get pissed off at all the sentry busters
That's a funny handle: Dr Face
bye guys
This vid
Cya alexxm
bye alexxm
Kandarihu, Dr Face is cool
It's Jurassic Park all over again.
Take care alexxm!
AssaultWithEmbraces, I guess he is.
Bye alexxm
Cya alexxm
alexxm, later
Kandarihu, I think his username on YouTube is 69starmix96, iirc
at this point its worth just leavin the sentry to its fate
Money
you run at them
bye alexxm !
then past them
Chrysalis, it's annoying to build another one up to lvl 3
BYe, alexxm.
kand, thats what the canteens are for
This vid...
Oh lord I love this one
oh this
HAH
not seen this one
Oh, THIS ONE
I was waiting for this one XD
I like how the mask changes facial expressions
wat
o_o
Pahahah
my sides
O_O
ok, that was quite good
WOW... dat woody
Lil_B: :D
O_o
Ok...
The backstab is the last good joke. The rest...
Oh god
Looks like my dorm.

Banjo Kazooie
yay stream makes it all the way to the shed!
Shower tiem
RARE
WHY U NO GO BACK TO NINTENDO
ugly
VenHur Microsoft Moneys
o_o
poor 'lestia
Molestia, I'm guessing?
^
Microsoft owns Rare as a 1st Party developer.
molestia is worst pony
^
Dat fail
^^
playing games with lavandia town theme in the background might be a bad idea
I was never scared of the Lavender Town theme, for some reason.
there is just something about G-Mod Animation that it still holds up in the days of the Source Film Maker
AJIsAwesome: i'm not afraid of it. but it causes me light headaches
G-mod is good for obscure and absurd shit
Ah.
SFM is more for semi serious shit
SFM is so hard to use, but give good results
like you wouldn't want to really make something like a giant spearheaded multi headed medic gun in SFM
it'd look wierd
Sasha is best pony.
but that shit would probably fly in g-mod
I wonder how Heavy got stuck in the walll in the first place....
AJIsAwesome hangovers man... everything's possible
Lil_B: That's true.
...
WUT
Things just went form bad to worse for Scout.
...
what just happened?
/me never had a Hangover, doesn't consume Alcohol
^

Wrek I know that Alcohole means Hangover every time :) (well... it does fo most people I know unfortunatly :( )

Lil_B: thanks :3
And to think I was just making an innocent comment...
Hey Sonny
Sonny, no one knows what it is but it seems like TF2+ponies vs Molestia
wtf...
Hai Sonny :)
I'm not even sure what's less cool out of bow ties and fezzes
lol
the only thing cooler is fish fingers and custard
They're both so uncool it's hard to choose
rofl xD
