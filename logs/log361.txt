04Dear Viewers:
04We have come to the decision of making a test, or experiment, if you may, this week regarding our chat configuration. The test consists of keeping the so-called 'Mane 6' rooms closed for streams outside of the live episodes as well as other special events. Our reasoning for such an action is all for the sake of better moderation, in order to bring you a more pleasant stream interaction

In other words, as the main BronyState Channel would be the hub for discussion in these occasions, the discussion could be better organized and kept free of trolls or other unsavory elements. However, we've heard complaints about this system, which is why we would like to hear your opinions regarding it. We assure you that this decision is merely in an experimental phase at the

Ugh, nobody ever tells me, they say it's top secret!
00,03Music: Civilization 3

Can anyone tell me if the mare-a-thon will be shown here tomorrow?

how long untill the movie starts
Im not getting any music?
derp
good night SweetTea
The sound has been doubled.
That's just disappointing.
so how do you get a lottery tiket
Its been 10minutes lets go with the movie
Thanks again to all the mods and admins who put Bronystate together and keep it running. I really enjoy these movie nights and of course the livestreaming of the new episodes in the morning :D
I wanna box of Derpycorn
what about after the stream?
07,01yes it will
0,5Well
I've never even had one single drink before, like a boss
lifedream #64. Learn to play this intermission music blindfolded
Dermathil: Didn't you win A-movie almost 6 months ago (Across The Universe)
its top secret
Okay. Worked out and just rebuilt my media pc.
LordCelestia: Just make sure you've got a friend who's used to being around drunk people, so they can handle you if you go over the top.
1,3we will be showing the marathon
0,5Truth be told, im only 16
So the countdown above is wrong?
Hey saywhat and hazard3 havent seen you sence last time
i feel like you guys want me to leave
hurasd
i would tell you but then i would have to kill you
All I need now is for the motherboard to come back from RMA.
LordCelestia: you a foal!
Everyone should have been drunk at least once by the time they're 18.
When does the marathon start?
mare-athon*
:(
!cd

04@IngloriousPony89: You could shoot us an email at bronystate@gmail.com
11,01You're welcome Cobalt
Hello, everypony.
hi
Meanwhile: different drinking laws
Marathon ends at 10:00?
Epic mixing going on.
it sounded like a farewell, Sir
LordCelestia: I'm 14, and I get drunk at least once every other week, what's your excuse.
0,5No just kidding
I need some rest from today's events...
Am I the only one who's ever cried during a Prince song?
hello
LC irrelevant, I was drunk before I was legally allowed to be.
05,15I'm 19 never have and never will drink
0,5Im 1543 years old
Tovler: that wasn't my choice
hi
0,5and still young
wassup\
MUFF
...ssssooooooooo?
Odd music
Now we just need a dubstep drop.
INS
(:
I never even heard of that movie before I saw it
yeah. I'm not used to young Mods.
11,01Marathon starts at 6 AM EST.
is 19 never had a drink
00,03Mare-A-Thon starts at 6:00 am EST!
Please
I was drunk in public at 15. You guys are weird.
oh yeah!
No dubstep...
STAAAAOOOORT PREASH NAO thx
I just have no desire to do much drinking. Besides, my parents would skin me alive if I did. Especially my dad
How are you all at present ?
StinkomanFan: I don't think I've ever HEARD Prince before
Well i'm stupid, my headphones were unplugge
00,03Ninja'd -_-
...the hay is with that poster art?
Isn't there movie night tonight?
i had a bass, but i dropped it
That's pretty hardcore. I don't know too many kids who get up that early.
/me is 27 drinks constantly
Same here BronyKing
Question for Luna, how long until I can vote for A movies again, and can I still vote for B movies and ponysodes?
Got a new PC case that looks like stereo equipment.
lol
OH PLEASE DUBSTEP PLASE
0,5Tovler: Got a problem with young mods?
i just found out that the mare-a-ton starts at the same time as the ACTA protests in germany
HEY!
I'll get on as soon as I can.
hey Ghosties my favorite color is red so you'r my favorite!
Being Drunk is bother overrated and underrated.
but does it end at 10:00 for HaHD?
WHAT hay is Ghost doing here
I ahve a concern!
ONLY 12 HOURS TO GO!
when does the new episode air?
Being from Europe... that's in just under 9 hours, right?
/me also not ashamed of it
Lucid: funny that, my dad was smoking weed not 3 hours ago.
im not alone yay
Meanwhile: Yeah, but we're from the UK.
wht times the movie?
0,5I'm completely silly when i want to be, but completely serious when I need to be.
hey dari
04I'm so glad I could be your favorite color, lol
So. You know.
My shiow's fanon was destroyed...
dari I know but come on!
I'm staying up all night. Just to see if this place ever dies before the ponies
We must start, TALLY HOO!
o god the chat is dead for me again *braces for sudden flood of messages any minute now*
My opinion on the chat ISSUES are clearly known already... This is pure insanity. It's impossible to follow the movie AND a chat that is this INSANE at the same time. It ELIMIANTES any reason to even COME here for brony movie night
IF MANECHAT IS CLOSED TOMORROW, HOW WILL POST SHOW GO DOWN?
If I didn't completely fail the interview I would have been the youngest mod here
LordCelestia: Indeed. You're not mature until you're 25.
What can i say I LOVE beer
but I did.
Who has seen the next movie
Hey Derm, gratz on the pony ep.
My favorite color is rainbow.
:P
So what got the mods to change their minds? I thought they were originally just doing the new ep.
so yarp.
it doesn't, StinkomanFan
I did that once
Also dari, you stole my Gondor line.
it wasn't fun
Which fanon? This show blows up fanon on a weekly basis.
StinkomanFan: i'm with you !
Dermathil: Ok, I must've thinking of someone else.
I have seen it
LC: but what happens if you want to be silly while you need to be serious?
11,01Not even for ponies?
0,5It works out.
thats 5:00 for me
Twi told derpy too?!??
is the next movie called Top Secret or do they just dont want is knowing what it is
Then you be real quiet.
IngloriousPony89: but you MUST! you must, you MUST!
How long do I have to wait before I can vote for A's again, and can I still vote for B's and Ponies?
Can the mods please open up the other rooms...?
I need to work on my fanfic anyway
00,03My favorite color is Gardevoir!
I pulled a 36-hour day for the season 2 premiere
worth it
Stole? Boy, I've been Gondoring since before you were born.
Just watched the top secret preview, it blew my mind
dont saly thiat i have to get up at 5
:P
No way. My sleep schedule must not be tampered with!
in the mornig
this is better
What? Chat will be shut off during Pony live streams? But that's the best thing about Bronystreaming is the commentary/reactions. :(
It's Called Top Secret :P
My favorite color is ponies
Gold & orange here
0,5Silly filly; i wouldnt be here if I was too silly ^_^
LordCelestia: I can never tell with you
Oh thank Celestia, it's slowed down a little...
My favorite color is bacon
Gardevoir is worst Pokemon
oh ok
thats like 12 for me so im cool
My favorite color is derpy
Shadowmere: im afraid thats top secret
the pokemon?
Besides
you are an enigma
Apple Bloom's dad co-wrote Bananaphone
1,34 weeks before you can get an A again
Lies! I pushed that phrase into memedom during the LOTR weekend!
Made by the same people who did Airplane
11,01We'll stream it in your sleep then.
how do I watch this on my ipod?
damn it!
more bollywood awesomeness www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh8g1CwGZGA
1,3*4 weeks
stormpony agreed
So... I know some mods have been leaving lately...
Xatu is best pokemon
a bacon flavoured enigma
My favorite color is invisible.
I always go on #bronystate, personally. I see it as the central hub for conversing, instead of breaking it up based on favorite pony.
00,03Yes, the pokemon.
Top Secret was even better than Airplane
ha... mane chat
what's the delay on the movie tonight
Stream it straight into our dreams...
Gardevoir is second best pokemon next to wailmur
Any idea whether there'll be any auditions soon?
My favorite color is clear
Bacon <3
PLAY
i have to wake up at 7am yaay~
isn't it more trouble to do announcements on EVERY channel tomorrow fro everything?
My mind is full of chat:P
it's odd knowing people who think Jackie Chan adventures is nostalgia
I WANT MOVIES
Personally I like Houndoom.
it is
Twilight is best pokemon
so is Animaniacs
11,01DeadpoolDash: No video links please.
my favorite color is rainbow
scyther

2004 is nostalgia?
sadface
Rainbow Dash is best Charizard
Im on MST. Anyone know wehn it starts here?
CYAN!
Ratata is best....
Animaniacs is 19 years old
I always go in Twilightroom cuz thats where my regular friends chill, and I can actualyl FOLLOW the dang chat.
AT NIGHT
my favorite color is plaid
Anything in the 90's and late 80's is nostalgia for me
grey is the only color worthy of my favortism!
think about that
buizel my favorite
I should totally be a mod. I would be best mod ever. Just sayin'
i prefer bronystate chat over mane6 rooms, but its a bit harder to keep up with chat now
Nothing is nostalgia for me.
So, what I miss when I was gone?
The first shiny pokemon i ever saw was a raticate
Twilight uses Hug & Tolerate
ANIMANIACS is 19 YEARS OLD
00,03inb4 bi-buizel
I hang in the AppleJack Room, because she wears a hat.
Dermathil: there were mod applications only about two months ago, there's not gonna be any more for a while
Animaniacs is 1993. Jackie Chan Advantures is year… 2002?
it SUCKED!
I've gotta go, good night everyone. Enjoy the movie.
My derpy is in the top percentage of all derps
