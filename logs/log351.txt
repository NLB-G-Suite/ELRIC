Queen_Rarity: bc it usually boils down to arguements on "best" pokemon and then shipping ensues...
/me does a PewDiePie reference
My response to Bieber is my same response to religion, world politics, war, and the opinions of other people. I really don't care.
brb
I make sure I avoid his songs as much as possible

YAY
Pokemon series has the absolute weirdest timeline Ive ever seen. It started out with Prof Oak sending Ash & Gary to go discover new pokemon, then all of a sudden several new pokemon and a new region is discovered and populated overnight. Then in all the flashbacks to ancient times, all current pokemon existed then, that season 1 Kanto had no idea about? O_o
Scoot-Scootaloo: I'm calling you Alex from now on.
...Holy crap you're right. o_o But I didnt formally introduce myself because I was shy SaxyPretender ^^"
YEAH
Therefore, the minumim would be 9180, there is no cap
00,03RAWRity >: (
ain't I a stinker...
Am I right?
one day i will travel the world and meet as many bronies as possible... top of the list is all the mods of bronystate
i just mean in general
LadyCanary: so shy you refuse to share your name with the group.
I wish I knew you people IRL so I can take you lunch money
ok
yes he does when u use thunder stone
x > 9179
Cypresswolf: it's simple: the makers of Pokemon hadn't thought of all that yet.
If I knew you people irl I'd have an excuse to leave my house.
Cypresswolf: maybe they're hundreds of years apart like zelda?
0,14^
00,03I think I met Flaire IRL during Bronycon!
I don't know. I would guess 800,000 or something
GARY MOTHERFUCKING OAK!!!!! :[:[:[
Sadly though, I don't. And I remain a cave dwelling troglodite.
wait no...
no
00,03I've met a lot of people during Bronycon...
I won't tell you guys my first name (mostly because about half of you already know it) but I will tell you that one of my middle names is 'Woodchurch'
like a baws.
....Wat.
hai Tophat
so what is 6-6x6?
Why couldn't that be possible
helloooooooo
think of each new Generation as a big ol' Retcon for the series.
Maybe...Then Ash has the best aging luck ever!
I think ther eare more than 800,000 bronies in the world

Scoot-Scootaloo: HOWEVER DID YOU KNOW?
Does Ash ever beat the elite 4 in the series?
I hope so

wrong
If that's true Ash is over a thousand years old
what
Wouldn't be the weirdest thing in Pokemon.
inb4 self-destru*explodes*
00,03Part of having Gardevoir colors means that I am a psychic type!
it's -30
Or are the creators saving that for the end of the series? Probably that...

Also that you're a crossdresser Scoot-Scootaloo
True

String_Shredder: Congratulations!
Lugia can piss off. I killed that douche like 80 times trying to catch him.
0,14...
0,14hey
the -
0,14hey
back in ye olde days, and by that I mean about a year ago, I caught all the pokemans in my copy of Yellow
Game wise, I like the evolution of graphic the pokemon series has. from black & white to monochrome, to full on 3D
and it was good.
0,14No one insults Lugia on my watch.
Professor Oak has a really big ranch. It's the only way
hehehe
What I really wish the Pokemon Anime would have done is to start of each new Region with a new protagonist, like the games and Manga. That way we don't have to constantly keep Ash and the others from developing.
you tell him Saxy
still hate me?
LUGIA HAS THE BEST SONG
00,03Lets name mods after pokemon!
/me tears off his shirt. "Come at me bro"

SlurryMoon is Solrok

SaxyPretender: NO
TopHat is a/an Deoxys
@Pony

Trubbish, whatever that is.

we need a pokemon show for the adult veiwers
Sax is that little steel pig
3Wait, why can't I be Lunatone?
*twitch*
00,03Sumica is more of a Marril
Why not Agron, Scoot-Scootaloo?
10,02What is this place, I don't even...
Sumica: youre a Poison type that looks like a pile of garbage, apparently.

Forgot about Mystery Dungeon series. Pretty good games. but hard as hell when you get to the 100 level dungeons that start you off at level 1
Hpw would the game be different if Zelda was a girl?
ummmm

10,02but but... i liek mah plot ;A;

Exactly
I liked the Mystery Dungeon series

lucky space core
Acreus SUCKS
i wish i were a pony
Some guy painting
07,01L stands for lady
SO BADDDLYYYYY
so can I be another LC?
L also stands for lewd.
10,02L also stands for SILLY FILLY :3
And Laryngitis.
Ladybird
And love :3
07,01nice music though
Lubricant.
do what you want cause a pony is free, you are a p-o-n-y!!
Loyal
And Lemon
lol he has painted for hours now
Inb4 Mad Hatter starts naming things that start with 'L'
OI
lex luthor
SPACE CORE
Sorry...back
This is true
L stands for Dewgong
My theory: The pokemon games happen in reverse order, 150 or so pokemon go extict between everygame. (Probably due to the fact that humans are extraterestrials and brought foreign viruses that could kill off all the pokemon in 15 years)
ludicrous
this pic is all kinds of D'AWWW and HNNNNNGG

Best hope you don't get tired and put me down, or I'll start biting your ankles again! :P
Imagine them coming out with the ultimate pokemon game that includes all regions, pokemon, items, everthing! In One Game! Call it Pokemon Overdose :)

I once spent an entire night with a bunch of my friends in a room watching every single LOTR film. Twice. It was incredibly homo.
It's been over 5 years since I sat down and watched every LOTR movie back to back
42 episodes means 14 hours straight of ponies
Nacho is the very best thing and when i want some i just simply click BING!
ScootaChicken: ALL the homo?

Lol!!
i was in the city the day of the 49er game that was fun
I didn't hear a "Don't you cry no more"
Shoot ALL the pews
Indeed, Phase4
Phase4: in all honesty, I doubt it.
emangamer: Yeah, ain't it great? I love your link sprees
Phase4: or quite possibly FORRRRRRRRREEVVVUUUUURRRR
TopHat: cue epic guitar solo
/me GUITAR RIFFAGE
this is the FS2: SCP isnt it... god it looks so AMAZING!
I think, at the very most, we'll have 4 seasons. SMart money's on 3.
I bet it was
yeah i was here during the episode
RAWRity: it depends on what hasbro does, thats what i meen by carefull
I expect it to go on for awhile, especially with all us bronies :o
me too
I guesstimate ~~ 6 seasons
I had allready writen the line, was tired of waiting for the line before it -.-
Phase4: Oh it will my good sir, it will
it was cool
i expect at least 4 seasons, probably 5
6 seasons sounds fair
TRANS
ohoh, you poor, doomed optimists.
FORMERS

/me is anticipating 400 seasons

Queen_Rarity: Simpsons isn't over.
Humanity's golden age
FOREVER A SHOW

simpsons is over for me
3.14 seasons isn't nearly enough
Phase4: If they run out of plots then yes
Humanity's only gonna be around for another couple hundred years
My mom says I'm as big as the sky...

in space, noone can hear you eat nachos
I'm not insane, i just like to kill
Hug all the things?
/me snorts ponies but fails
suddenly COLOSSUS!!!
:(
LOL
in space, noone can hear you screem bees
emangamer: 1, seen it. 2, it looks delicious. 3, I sort of feel like that thing being created signals the decline of humanity as a species.
Or was it Horseshoe Junction....with a raccoon as the mascot
TOY_PON3|Homeless: stop, this is getting to a weird and unnessicary level
emangamer: Okay :P
If a tree falls in the woods and nopony is around to hear it, does it make a sound?
YFW we find Mars was inhabited by a race of ancient bees
RAWRity: 3 is wrong, it simply shows our amazing ingenuity to become fatter....and tastier
i: yes
emangamer: nonsense mah boi, I find it rather humorous
otakon: did you find the scale thing?
Are those created from those coloured hamburgers Spongebob sells? emangamer
INB4, Mars is a planet
oh alright
wait... MARS IS A PLANET!
Jim: no...look at the box inthe background....I hope you weren't being serious
emangamer: like I said, our decline as a species. We've reached the peak, and now we're going downhill from here.
i got a star! ^-^
I might give it a try sometime
:D
wait.. URANUS IS A PLANET?
Ace~!
Push mid!
/me gives Shizuka a gold star

0,14Congrats, Shizustream.
/me comes back and is not addicted anymore
:3
yo bro u average?
0,14I'd be happy to have you as a wingmate anytime.
emangamer: yes, but that was about silly stuff like dancing, or music, or television. This is about a monstrosity of processed food so alien from the natural world that I'm not convinced it doesn't kill grass just by existing.
http://www.terrariaonline.com/attachments/your-argument-is-invalid-jpg.6994/
Shizustream is best Space Piolet.
I am AverageBro-Nee

/me hands Randomnerd the blue pill
Obama wings?
Shizuka: DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGE
Shizustream: remember, hit and run!
Shizustream: Do a barell roll!
that nebula mission will be soooo boring for you guys ><
lol
it is a boring mission
lol
Nebulae are never boring
RAWRity: well that's what happens when things becomed streamlined. People try to find the best way to increase profits while reducing costs. Sadly it's cheeper to eat unhealithly and eat at mcdonalds everynight than it is to make your own dinner. It's simply the problem with having such a large population
0,14No worries, we'll still enjoy it.
RED DEAD REDEMTION: SHOULD OF HAD PONIES
inb4 tl;dr
ikr?
Koof?

0,14Give them what for, buddy.
TOY_PON3|Fancy: with great fancy, comes great money...and with that comes FREE POLITICS
emangamer: I'm not talking about people making unhealthy stuff for money. I'm talking about somebody going to the trouble of MAKING that damn thing, just because they wanted to say they could, or worse, actually thought it would be a good idea. When we've reached that point as a species, I don't think there's a way to recover from that.
oops, hull integrity 69%
tl;dr
WOOOO
ramming speed... bad idea when no forward shields
Cake!
NEEEERRRRDSS
This is like the KFC Double Down, but...somehow so much worse.
Do you have Xbox?
0,14At least you have shields, F15s don't have that luxury.
we need sum chicken!
RAWRity: I dont see how THAT is a problem. that's like shaming someone for making a 7 layered cake. Nothing wrong with it, as long as you eat in in moderation.
free ponies... FOR THE WORLD!!
^
The first one
I support free ponies

Vermin Supreme!:D
also: I can eat a sandwich and a banana for about 75 cents. McD's doesn't beat that
and I'm hardly trying
_▲________________________________________________▲▲
My dad went to VERMIN SUPREMES HOUSE!!!
TopHat doesn't know how to triforce
that was difficult to make
/me removes TopHat and puts on Boot
;)
emangamer: because cake actually has some connection to actual food. That things is just ground up bone marrow and preservatives, waiting to shove its gummy tendrils into your arteries and strangling you from the inside out.
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-pikachu-vs-ponies.jpg
TOY_PON3|Fancy aquired boot!
/me takes ALL the fancy in the chat
RAWRity: according to that logic you could say that about a SINGLE gusher
I had to trade it for a TopHat
:)
I bet no one else is that cool
yeah I do
fancy boots
Guys please try to slow down with the Links. One or two is alright but this is getting a little out of hand.
inb4 chat is ded
post all the links! *troll face*
why do you ask?
Nope.
inb4 RAMMING SPEED!!
Colossus, that sounds safe
/me slays MahBoi777
emangamer: yes, I could. and then this person decided to take that gusher and increase it exponentially. It's Gusher^10 if you will.
osting link was my only way to get attention :'(
dat emantrollslayer
I just dont see a need in buying something you might not like
/me uses finger to stop sword
Gusher to the power of 10 is greater than or equal to a singe fruit rollup
osting?
oh, thats real nice of you
mfw that means cheesing in my language
RAWRity: I'm confused. What is it you have the problem with? The food with which it was constructed, or the sheer fact that it was constructed at all.
no worries though, I probably wont be playing it :P
Wow, took me Forever to realize my chat screen had died -_-
i was in a chatroom with but forest-fire but i left how can i find it
posting links was my only way to get attention :'(
emantrollslayer: it's mroe the fact that somebody's more than willing to eat that.
RaveBrony: its taken me hours sometimes
Moop: Not true.
Ponies: There is no escape
Just spam :P
RAMMING SPEED!!!!
RAMMING SPEED
Moop: try to say somethign actually funny or intellectual instead of resorting to someone else to do it for you. Or just write excessive amounts of text like I do. that way everypony has no hope to NOT see it
You fool!
Phase4: what do I put in my URL to autojoin a room
Lol, I was just...waiting for someone to say something then said something and it did pop up xD
hello
0,14Ugh, foolish ideals.
RAWRity: it tastes good. we are told by a 'reputable source' (often parents) it is acceptable. Until we are told otherwise, why would you suspect?
JUST SHOOT THE ARROWS
Haha kk
*then I said something
That thing should trigger your self preservation instincts, and have your arm involuntarilly hurling it away as fast as possible as your brain shouts "WHAT HAS BECOME OF MY LIFE?" at you.
forward decks 400 through 1200... damn....
Either they are REALY far away, or those ships are moving at the speed of smell..
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
RAWRity: I would eat it. It just LOOKS and probably tastes good as well. Like I said, nothing wrong with eating it, just so long as you dont eat anything else for the next 3 weeks
You know what would go great with this game?
What are disputing about atm? O.o
0,14What, GabeMoist?
The Infinity Engine
Chips
RAWRity: actually the self-preservation instinct is to eat as much as possible so that you can survive.
It takes quite a lot ofenergy to move thoseships, Placebo
a cheeseburger?
moar medals! <3
TopHat: need to modify the site to do that, but for a stand alone page with the chat in it this is the url ponychat.net/webchat/?config=bronystate&autojoin=%23bronystate,%23Twilight_Sparkle
^-^~
It seems like eating that things is something you need to take a shower afterwards.
Also, yay, Pegasi medal.
* lolololollolol something funny something hilarious meme joke *insert here* hidden MLP reference.
GO SHIZU!!
oh wait, was the discussion about the SPECIFIC mass of junk, or the stuff it was made up of in general

Shizustream: why are you so awesome
/me pins another medal onto Shizustream.
The pegasi is now safe
I was watching a video of it, and it's quite awesome

RawketLawnchair: In space? Where there's no air resistance? Or gravity?
MahBoi777: Oh my god, i could go for some SmashBruger right now
TopHat: swap # for %23 , its a , sepperated list of channel names
LOL that weeaboo fag vinyl is in here
Placebo, it's just a game. You should probably just relax.
My troll senses are tingeling
SayWhat: IKR?

Yippee!!!
Alright, fine. Magic. There you go, Placebo
Ha ha!
outgoing jump signature, troll configuration
RAWRity: PLEASE dont get into THAT. I've seen too much of that shit already today...in fact too much this week.
covert missions are hardest missions... GAH!!
RawketLawnchair: that would be a perfectly fine excuse, if they used it. "willing suspension of disbelief" and all.
The internet can be summed up like this: Their = They're = There... the end

Is Shizuka still on the asteroid mission?
Rule 168: Always follow rule 167
Why do I climb the mountain? because I'm in love with the mountain
nothing wrong with furries, they're good people
rather be a brony
Cypresswolf: I would you reccomend you send him Cutie mark crusaiding. it is a good introduction to thee series
moment
Midnight_Tempest: I never said there was. I was simply point out that rule 34 is not ALL an act to troll
great idea :)
how did people start talking about furries and rule 34?
Imagine an alternate universe when it was My Little Cow
What would it be like?
lol?
evening gentlemen
Furries are cool. But only to a certain degree

^-^~
/me salutes Shizustream
0,14I am proud.
Jim is best John Madden
^
/me gives Shizustream a gold star
Shizustream: You did great job
;)
mine is better
and #1 is TRIXIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Personally, I like Aj's character. She's not a pony that is made to jump out at the screen to try and grab attention. She's the "Straight man" to everypony else's crazy antics, and I like that.
:)
Jim IS John Madden
Spike is best
0,5Shizustream, where is your %?
spike is best dragon
this is my laptop
SayWhat: LOL
However, I dont have a favorite pony.... I love every one of them equally xD
0,5Put your % on THIS INSTANT young lady. Youre exposed!
The shame!
.-.
but i do...
Shizuka: see?
i think im gonna get this game again
thus the pings
lol dat LC
What game is this? It looks like Wing Commander but not
0,5No, thats Shiuk- oohhhh...
freespace2
Are we gunna just play this game til it's beaten?
0,14it's Freespace 2, Spamcannon
0,5Oh so NOW youre multiplying
RAWRity: and while that may appeal to some, I think most are looking for fantasy amd magic
Because i think i can do that
spaaaaaaaaaace
^
Dad, are you in space?
LC, I am just as confused as you
^
yes son, now we are a family again
trolldad in space!!
Are you proud of me, dad?
/me 's brain explodes from cpntaining too many confusion particles
No!
stairdad
trolololololol
/me says who
:D
:)
say whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
YOY_PON3 im not dead i just dont have a brain.
My little Portal: Science is Magic
RAWRity: like I said, being human like is her own charm, but that is not that I, personally, am looking for
WAIT NO PARASPRITS!!
/me punches the science off of Bronystate's face
:o
My Little Portal: Friendship is a Deadly Neurotoxin
She's the one there to 1: be the stable character when others lose it, and 2: drop the occasionally snark when presneted with her chance. It's an imprtant part of the group dynamic that unfortunately goes underappreciated.
lol
0,14Y u do dat, GabeMoist?
http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/747017_o.gif SAY WHAAAA
I like every one of the ponies personalities. O.o I cant even imagine how Anypony can choose a 'best' xD
:D
i love them all
Nonono man, you're making me fall asleep.
RaveBrony is best pony ;)
WAKE UP
Lol xD
After all, if you didn't have at least one member of the group who was in the right mind most of the time, they'd never get anything done.
Happy Kitty, Sleepy kitty, little ball of furr; Warm kitty, soft kitty, purr purr purrrrr
TOY_PON3 is obviously best pony! xD
Cipher, because I love wife like sun raise, dark man you will suffar
RAWRity: that is true. But as I said, whe is overshadowed by magic, flying, extream cuteness, breaking the 4th wall, and umm....fabulosity? and as I have said they are more desierable to most people.
i'ma try again to upload my video, brb
I choose Twi because she's the sexiest
/me uses foghorn on Jim
RaveBrony: Oh it's true. It's true
well im obvoisly best filly
no that trixie
:)
;)
Fluttershy, i choose you!
it looks like my stream froze, everyone else still good?
lol
0,14...I'm...not following GabeMoist.
/me is foghorned
fillyfillyy is best mule
0,14I'm good, Shizustream
:D
For another good example of the Straight Man amonst insane people, look at Agent Washington in Red Vs Blue.
Seems like it froze over here.
hm
LOL
just kidding fillyfillyy
0,14it froze, but refreshing fixed it
RAWRity: Wash is STRAIGHT
are you FUCKIGN kidding me
I don't follow me either
Two years ago, back in 2012, I watched the 3rd season of MlP. What did you guys think of it?
GabeMoist: just Gabe Newell!
Ah there we go.
SayWhat: It was alright
Lol xD
emantrollslayer: not at all. he's the one approaching things from a logicl standpoint, where as the Blood Gulch crew takes whatever insanity and just roles with it.
0,14Ghost Eye is best AWACS.
RAWRity: the closest thing to the staright man in RvB is either Griff or Doc, that show doesn't have straight men.
mane 6 crew TS-brains RD-pilot AJ-muscle PP-wildcard Rt-face FS-stare
Last person to reply to this wins!
what?
I SHALL BE THE LAST
Well, it's 7:30 am, time to go to bed
Good night everypony
good night
0,14later Jim
gnight Jim
sleep tight
Are you in europe?
Cya Jim
dont let the parasprit bite
:)
^nice
:D
RAWRity: while that is true, he goes to such far lengths to acomplish his mission, just look at when he destroyed South's body.
<--- Mind has been BLOWN
hi everypony
LolxD
Hi
emantrollslayer: nah, Griff is the most self-aware of the BG guys, and Doc mostly just seems so disconected from the weird shit that he's just accepting of everything that happens. Wash is the one that is constantly saying "Wait. What the fuck just happened?"
hi Yellowquiet
what game is that ?
Dat text wall ._.
0,14Freespace 2
Free Space 2
freespace 2
emantrollslayer: that's standard operating procedure. plus she DID shoot him.
looks nice
10,02Dem silly fillies
so much thunder
^
/me hugs Yellowquiet and then goes to sleep
such silliness
gn jim
Jim sleep hugs people
/me hugs Jim back
10,02Silliness is off the charts!
well thats uploading, lets see if it works this time
So be aware that you may be ghost-hugged
dat silliness
/me 's eyelids begin to slowly descend
RAWRity: still while he may have the most human like emotions, under no circumstances would I call him the "straight man" ACTUALLY the only one I could call that is York.
0,5Applejack flies through the air
0,5Apples fall without a care
Silly, isn't he?
nice
10,02Bender: 'Come on Universe, give me all the juice you got!!'
LOL
Lol^
I'm all out of juice
lol!!
xD
emantrollslayer: nah, York's the snarky guy who takes things as they come with a sarcastic line and a bit of befuddlement. Wash is the serious foil to the BG guys' inanity.
10,02"Ohhhh....Mamma...."
I thoght MlP was better than Futurama and we discussed this already
RAWRity: or hell Tex is more humane than Wash
SayWhat: they're both good
RAWRity: isn't that what ANY human would so? that's what I would anyway
MahBoi777: This is true
Tex played that role in the early seasons, but by S5 she was very accepting of the nonsense.
Say the word... What
Well I'm going to head out too everypony!! You all take care and have fun! Ill be back tomorrow :)
0,14later RaveBrony
Make tha face!!
SHIRTLESS PARTY!!!!!!!
bye Rave Brony
RAWRity: when you date church/alpha/the director/lenord/whatever the FUCK you wnat to call him, you kinda have to
bye RaveBrony!
good bye
/me waves bye to everypony! :$
'ravebrony
and "Straight Man" doesn't equate to the most human/realistic. It just means the character who isn't enclined to wackiness, and instead is meant to be a character for the craziness of others' to bounch off of.
/me waves back
RAWRity: and how does that not equal york?
Sheila! come back! I made you muffins!
muffins can i haz some
MahBoi777: no, caboose =/= derpy
/me gives TheDr some muffinz
York doesn't have much time to really deal with any out-and-out craziness. Just the quirkiness of Delta, and the intense seriousness of the Freelancers. While he might have served as the Straight Man were he to meet the wackier characters, he never played that part in the group dynamic.
YESSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

10,02Placebo: O U U SO SILLY :3
10,02Night LadyBlackhawk! :D
Essentiallly, a character can have the atributes of a "Straight Man" but unless those traits are exploited to achieve that result, the don't count as one.
Thank you Shizuka <3 <3 wub!

emantrollslayer: yes, but the end of S8, he's become more jaded by the shit he's found himself in, but there's still times where he plays the Straight man, especially when dealing with Doc
see ya soon LadyBlackhawk
RAWRity: those were the funnies scenes, season 8 with doc. "NAH, look at how slow he's moving"
