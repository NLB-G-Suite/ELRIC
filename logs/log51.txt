Cya.
The reeds of Saxs and Clarinets are similar IIRC.
But Saxs have larger ones.
Anyway, I'm gone.
They can be used interchangeably in most cases
i would have failed if it were possible
I had an idea on how ponies could ply instruments like guitars without being supported
*play
unicorns can do anything

imagine the insurments, pretty much durms would be the only insturment that would be pretty much the same
03yes.
xD
03also I have a reason for using 2.9x
;o
03if you look up adplug
12connection bork
03it's a plugin that lets you play .imf audio files
03XD

adblocker ftw
I like adds.
They support websites and help keep things free.
i like aids
Yup. First tab.
yeah
i installed adblocker today actually
No they don't.
03and the song itself has been around since before Febuary 2010 o.o
depends.
but usually
its because of popularity of the song probably
Well a lot of sites have per page view adds.
And that's click-only.
03well yeah
why does EqD allow shit fanfics on their site?
yeah
i mean, have they even heard of editors?
03it's on the same album that Secrets was on
and i dont even listen to public radio anymore
03which was on the radio like last year
03I do
they do

TONS
i swear i tell my sister more than once to turn her crap down
i cant read it

03hmm

bye bye
/me hides

i'll only get 11 hours of sleep if i want to catch today's stream ;_;
Nou
Bye all. May the Leverage be with you!
I use 5 because it has format converter & auto-tag
ONLY 11 hours he says.
03eh
Nothing, waiting for suggestions.
03auto tagging sucks
Nothing, the stream is offline
tbh, she hates me entirely
03iTunes does auto tagging and I've seen lots of typos in there
Stream's online btyw.
03especially for Pokémon music
btw*
I've made several suggestions.
The stream is online, he's just browsing EqD.
03I put my 2BA Master CD in my computer, iTunes thinks it's the spanish verson >_>
Oh, whoops.
lmfao
/me runs
that are all pony-related
-.-
03nah
03I don't hate people

03I tell lot sof people to go die
03especially in fires
03do i actually meanm it?

03that's for you to decide :P
03...so do you
03it must run in the family
03LL and I don't swear at all :)
You are on EqD.
yes, but not AS bad as HER
>>
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_kIVI9y_OY
03yes but killing half as many people as someone else is still against the law
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/comedy-pmv-submission-post.html
/me hides
03yes bad metaphor I know
That is my suggestion
XD
03this song tha tI cannot stand
03is on a CD I might need
03>_>
03because it's on the radio ALL THE TIME
03ADELE

03yeah
/me np: Nyan Cat - Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! MP3@185kps
03I just hate those
03I mean, guitar is cool but guitar + annoying female singing voice + nothing else just pisses me off
Fine, after this.

03now I just get their occasional release
03pirated of course since I can't legally get them
03YOU might be able to :P
03basically they only sell to DJs
lol
XD
03and when I say sell I mean SELL, the CDs cost like $40 EA>CH
03which for 20 songs is NOT worth it
XD
03you don't need to be professional
03otherwise I'd sign up and just lie
damn you
03the nice thing about PO is that lots of times they have songs beore they're officially released.
03that, and their Mainstream Radio series generally has the clean "radio edit" versions which can be hard to find for lots of songs :P
/me might go to RPC Audio for that
;p
this is boring
03let me see if I can find it
no
its a creepypasta

03funny you should say that.
03I'm trying to find the actual CD of Transformers 3 score
03I already have them in mp3 form
04Oh really?
03but I'm trying to find the actual disc
03like completely sold out
04For a second I thought you were gonna bash it LOL
03so I'll look elsewhere
03nope
04H-uh

04Yeah, I don't really mind waiting another 30 seconds.
03np
04I'm used to it with the YT mp3 converter
03WHY THE F*** ARE THERE NO TRANSFORMERS 1 OR 3 SCORES ANYWHERE?!?!?!?!?!
03and LOL converting, fail
is is a cool song http://www.myspace.com/video/566764070/my-little-eurodancer-pony/107761737
04Well it's the only way (I can be bothered) to get some of the tracks I want
03it would be fine
04Because most of the time I only want a single track from the album/score.
03but I would suggest seeing the other two
03why
the other two didn't intrest me
03the first one is definitely worth seeing
03I thought the second was good but a lot of people here didn't like it for some reason
04Fair enough drf
04LLOTS is the same
cool, moon landing alternate history
03yeah, that was awesome XD
03I mean
03NO SPOILERS
04drf, I liked the second - more story than the first.
03same here
03I liked all 3
03they were all equally good
03but some people like Articuo hated it
03+n
043 had a bit too much action (not that I'm complaining) and some nice plot twists
inb3: mmichael bay's scene cuttting
03oh yeah @ plot twists
03I was actually surprised at some parts
lol.
04For the whole 2 1/2 hours about 2 were spent on fighting scenes XD
04Ditto
04<SPOILER> YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT YOU SONNUVAGUN
03LOL
O.......K.......
*the
03you can always type spoilers 3,3 like this
Dang
04Which cinema? Because no cinema in Aus does that
owait, that's the OST, not score
right?
03probably.
03the OST is just a bunch of random crappy songs :/
04Aus cinemas are crap and way too expensive.
wut?
04$13 bucks for a single ticket. I can get cheaper at Dumaresq street. $5 per person.
03but for some reason
03all I can find are used copies from $120 and up
03which is stupid
04o_O
03again I have them all already but I want them physically

Freaking locks.
I would've missed games like "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors" if it wasn't for the region free
i hope soon we make more region free games, like we have now, or have blizzard understand this
but really the 3DS is region locked
It is, it is
And it's annoying because handhelds thus far have always been region free
At least on Nintendo's and Sony's part

9that is genius
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!
Looked like the funniest film ever.
9but that is also painful genius
9that said
9we're live.
9warning: keep tissues handy
Ok.
8megusta.jpg
8we arent live XD
9So Dari
9you can stream, right?
Yeah, you're using the mibbit I guess
Yeah, my sound's really quiet though.
10Ah
Even though it's full volume on my computer.
9testing audio
o.o
9how is it?
Perhaps I should just switch the bg color for this channel
/me falls over and lols
There we go
What's this?
9Hipster, how about now?
*sneaks away from the scene*
8same
This is some VN?

10Stealth*
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36197681.html
9sorta, it IS a VN but really more like a movie
8it has begun
Alright
I like VNs myself, especially "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors"
This thread. It needs more leverage.
9Oh, that's a great one
Unfortunately that means having to make leverage.
9gimme a sec
9it needs more leverage
/me makes leverage.
Let's just get some beverages
06:3
8i need to screencap this movie and make more image macros
9gonna see if I can make another solution
INB4 we all get banned.
8XD
/me puts Espeon on her back D:
9there
9press play
9so I have to use my Speakers
9gotta find a solution for that
9I was quite digging using headphones
9testing audio
10Woop

Oh wait.

12:)
9roger
8i hear it
/me brees all over you
9setting this thing on autoplay
/me breefloofs
12heh
9and whether we should stream it sometime
9yeah, a movie you read xD
10Ohai Obsi
But isn't that VNs mostly are?
what*
9yeah,but most other VN's have interactivity
9Narcissu
9it's freeware
COolio
And well, interactivity varies between games, yeah
How long is it?
9this is pretty much a Butterfly Circus, but with more despair
06Hihi
9not much, I think one can finish it in the time of a regular movie
Oh, cool.
9if you liked Policenauts, I hope you've played Snatcher
Maybe I'll give this a shot sometime
Yeah, I played Snatcher after finishing Policenauts
9Snatcher we'll stream here eventually
Too bad that two stickers and the spine card were missing, otherwise it'd be complete
Suddennly, louder music
9fixed my audio cable a bit
ok
Gonna go and finish my coding for today now

12hi
9why hello there
or not sure if he is *shrugs*
It's*
not colored dari?
9you feel relieved there's no pigs in the stream?
It was Bjornfot's suggestion.
06Breeface
06and :33
8i should have known
Haha. XD
/me 8makes a note to check their IP's today
Heheheh.
8also, dari, did you stay up all night?
semi
Nah, I fell asleep when I put the stream on some playlist at about...
he just left on some YTP and left or something
9 am.
8damn man
*shoots dari hard with a hand cannon* don't listen to bj again
Next time I should stream the whole thing. :P
awwww
why did you go and do that
:P
8accidental quads on /chat/, like a boss
i thought it was a system between you all to agree to allow a stream to be unscheduled and play it
hello there!
3rd movienight in row
I was the only mod left at the time.
i know x3
thats why i brought up that point
8but that was technically part of post-show
Oh hey the stream's on...
I only streamed the pilot episodes.
nais
well first beginning episode and half of the second and you broke in with spiders web
Heheh.
8wait
8you interrupted PONIES for spiders web?!
*face hoofs*
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/131083054993.jpg

Madness?
THIS IS LEVERAGE!
8brilliant
9Narcissu
9really sad
8honestly i havent really been following it
9anyways, this is the sort of thing you should watch from the start
its very beautiful regardless
9so I really think that to stream it, we'd need to set a time and date
/me awakens
12noooooooooo\
12hi
9and that's it for the preview xD
9I'll be back in a sec
9but going offline
9is it worth a try?
8hmmmm
8i kind of had a hard time getting into it
8cuz i tend to check other tabs
13I have a request :D
PM it or Message Me on MSN :3
9yeah, needs more search
9anyways brb
13Just reminded myself I need to buy/play Kirby's Epic Yarn
13every time I see in shops I'm like "waaaaaant D:"
9Dari: my plan is to stream Gokaiger before every stream
9and OOO's after every stream
9I mean, movie night
9so yeah

I gotta say, were it not for the leverage, last nights BMN would probably have been the worse
12making his opinions invalid
is it because he's mainstream?

03I already have enough to do

12i have wow and i rarely play it
It won't be as frantic as it was last night though
12i have the world's most addicting games and i'm not addicted to it lol

06I have like 160 from ... when did I get it, march or something? xD

06mmhmm
My gamerscore is 0`
03she was kinda mad that I beat her to 10,000 but eh
06i bet he cant even beat me in UT 2004
Was typing it as he was, he pressed enter before
03lu
Result: Herpidy derpidy
lmfao, i know someone whos on over 50k
03I don't like first person shooters
03so of course you'd beat me
06i figured xD
03LOL
03I'm not terrible at the games I have all the achievements in
03I'm not necessarily GOOD either
06and i mean, no-one
lol does anyone know of the 11 year old from the UK that bought way too much off of XBL
06Not saying that either, but especially with the unusual hats in tf2
02You
02Me
02UT
02Now
02:3
06if you wish
03well I tend to achievement farm just to get completes XD
03but eh
06or was, rather
06to be honest, give me dual enforces or a flak gun
06and the
06*then
06SPLATSJ!
03LOL flak guns
03mopst epic thing ever
/me runs
03*most
06Role playing games know to make the silliest achievements sometimes
Most gamers are trash talkers
06hehe
03I generally just admit to not being very good
:p
06before you can even zoom in its like
06OHSHI-
06ripperzz
02I don't zoom lol
06trash talking isn't bad as long as it's relatively friendly competition and not outright sh*t talking :P
03I play for fun, not to get lots of wins
02I use another playstyle
could not connect at all
02xD
06mmhmm
I play offline and by myself
03collecting achievements != being a pro
As that is the most fun D:
06what do you call that playstyle then?
That's... completely random.
weird
9inafter inafter
7There we go.
06mine actually has a name, RETARD style :P
/me runs
I never slept last night...
yea ;)
6Hey Ruben
well it's evening actually but woke up an 1 hr ago ;)
nothing really :P
7Really, now?
I think I'm going crazy, ruben's text looks slightly pinkish
03just people claiming to be pros at Unreal Tournament, basically.
06only me bragging overdosis
02nah
06xactly
02I'm not at pro xD
02-t
06For some reason it makes them upset to hear a proper definition of a word :P
/me flops
03who plays for cash o_O
03that seems silly to me
02A lot of people, lol
Is this only ever on fridays/saturdays?
03hence proving my theory that the majority of people are stupid.
06stuff like
7Lol.
7Competitive versus pro?
6Unless we do an event, yes.
7On a random note, my bedroom window is a natural beetle trap.
Ok shame I missed all of them upto last week
7Beetles drop in, and they can't fly out.
I just down right missed all of them.
03kill them all >:|
eat them
03EW eating them
7Except for this really large one that looks like some cockroach.
06get a spider
06or something
6Preshow, it is running.
/me dies
03Ugh
/me grossed out
7Eh, that's possible.
03good time to to go shower
03bbl
03shower then errands
06:p
/me leaves
;p
10XD
Trolols
Why would you kill beetles?
Beetles are awesome.
for 23 minutes.
7I don't intentionally kill them. O_o
[18:35] <drf|away> kill them all >:|
7My window just happens to act as one when it's closed.
03wait
03what
03prince-dari
03are you using background colors
i see how leverage went crazy...
Maybe, it's inconvenient to switch it off when going back and forth between servers.
03oh
03OK
How'd I go crazy?
7Another server that allows background colors?
03was going to say, that's not allowed here.
7And I thought we were flexible. O.o
03though, are you using mIRC?
7yep.
03there's a simple script fix to make it not use background colors here.
I don't go on any other servers that don't allow background colours. O_o
7Why, light?
there we go
Yeah, I'm using mIRC.
7last pre-show we watched 2 gummies for 2 hrs
03TST is the only place I've ever been to that DOES allow colors
oh, i'm on UT now, litterly
Oh, I wasn't here for last weeks show :P
03most IRC channels are just plain text.
And Nyan cat for over 16
7literally?
UT has a irc client build in
03yes literally.
in the multiplayer section
7I was talking to light.
I never said he kept his sanity
i'm assuming he webt mad
Wow, I've never seen allow any colours, and all the ones I go on don't stop you from using background colours either. O_o
03just replace that #silverwings to like
7hehe
03!#Silverwings
03or something
He does that...
6I watched Nyan cat for 25 hours... I regret nothing.
I have listened to Epic Sax man for 5 hours straight though
:D
bai :<
Nyan Cat for 10
i tried 10 hours, gave up after 25 mins
Meh, I think I'll just use $active in the current colour script I have.
03whatever you prefer. Just letting you know you can;'t use background colors here :P
Fitting
:p
03so do loads of other people
:)
12hmm
But I have to use colours on one place to stand out.
03>attention wh*re
>Bridal dress
Nah, it's because I'm a mod, and there are up to 300 people talking at once. :P
>Possible pun detected
The non-mods aren't allowed to use colours.
inb4 Leverage Spam
sigh leverage
03heh
03that's...weird
03I'm used to mods being treated as normal members of the community, not gods :P
Meh, it's a good system, it works.
03I'd probably derail it in seconds.
Derail it? LOL
03yeah
Good luck with that.
03thanks.

whoever's streaming needs to play DSII over all the sound effects
