0BUENO
12well
poor pinkie
Silverscreen Cinema Fact: Pinkie's actually dressing the way strippers in the 1800s dressed. This is the most obvious case of Crap Past the Radar on this show.
lol
at least spike has good taste in music
To be fair, it's kind of supposed to be terrible. The two groups were united in their hatred of it.
lol
and her friends are just like 'yeah
lol
12that's why i said he needs to be around rinna and vinue
No wonder they couldn't work out "we need to make a narrow path for the Buffalo to stampede through"
Absotively
So according to Pinkies Song we should go to WAR!
I dont think RD is really into singing lol
Trolled

DON'T STOP GOTTA TROT DJ PON3'S BEATS ARE HOT

I understand now why the camera is always tilted. The cameraman hated the movie so much, he drank before every shoot so he could forget about it
they filmed this movie on the side of a mountain

9we can just get them there
Otherwise it could be seen as unfair to people who get to choose episodes for the movie nights.
the entire season?
PONY SIGN? You need to leverage without rhythm.
And the other mods might get a bit peeved with me.
go ahead, play the pilot
7wwwwwaaaaaaaat!
7no dari, that's nonsense
0But you have Leverage Dari?
9Leverage without rhythm, you won't leverage the pony!

0Anyone else not getting video?
I'm just testing audio.

You mean they need to leverage Battlefield Earth 2 into production.
Hmm.
7i got audio
I'm not sure if I can get it to go any louder.
9leverage, best forced meme in months
I have no pictures.
I hear something from the stream
but its very faint
stopped sound
9whoop, we went offline

I guess everypony will just have to turn their volume up.
Yeah,I 'm trying to make it louder.
LOUDER
and get some video,
if you will.
I mean,

*deep breath*
Rainbow Dash: Louder!

9oh, stick ML Wu-Tang clan on there
Yeah, that's as loud as my volume will go. :/
gaiz,

0oat don't love our leverage ;_;
i see nothing
"you know your a pony when" discussion.
GO.
oat hates it what about /b/?
no
you yell in lowercase letters
9You know you're a pony when you sign all your official documents with your mouth
Leverage or GTFO. Thank you Sol. :)
Well I suppose the volume will be okay.
:D
if that is all you can do
You know your a pony when you have leverage
o.o
9when the weather is bad, you grumble about the pegasi sleeping on the job
so what rule is that Dashite
?
9you ship Rainbow Dash x Anything
0Well, I've been trying to introduce it, but this stuff don't work without a raid
It's Rule Leverage
9You accidentally say 'Anypony' in public
I actually caught myself saying Anypony the other day...
was just too lazy to remove them from the lines I was pasting over, which was drf's
9I've started thinking it
drf, it's running but apparently it screwed up
9I go 'wonder what everypony's doing--oh fffuuuuu'
It just kinda slipped out. I don't think anyone noticed. No one said anything at least.
9I keep waiting for good Brony merch
you know your a pony when you curse Celestiadammit
Looks like Ghosties posted on the leverage thread, I thought he said he was going to bed
You know your a pony when you ask for grass in your sandwhich without thinking.
I said that once
9so I can proudly wear a Pinkie Pie tee in public
9or decorate my dorm with pink posters
9right now all the merch is like...
or spam FUG servers with Pinkie Pie?
on tf2?
I thought about putting a Twilight "Read" poster in the EMS library near my office.
I guess you guys will just have to put the sound up then.
Stream's on.
you know your a pony when you yell at the store clerk for selling pink celestias.
9hey this is youtube?
9lol
eh good enough for me
03so you can't get in with VNC either?
03FMA wants to charge me 5 to fix something if it's not their fault so eh
/me turns volume all the way up.
/me 9has volume up
/me 9still can't hear :/
I should play Beat Hazard or Audiosurf to MLP tunes.
/me is going to be deafened half way through this stream when the volume fixes itself.
I think it would be quite fun.
9Audiosurf is kind of fun to Eurobeat tunes
03oh
that leverage mush have deafened you
03cool
I've played a couple pony songs in Beat Hazard.
I hold first place on Elfen Lied's OP.
9but you guys ever tried Audiosurf with Drum & Bass?
For Pro.
its really low
9like Pendulum
I'm NEVER giving that up.
drf
I got in lol
9Pendulum on Audiosurf is SICK
03yeah I saw it
My volume is approximately 3.86 times higher than usual!
9my little leveraaage

Well, when you manually tamper with the weather, there's bound to be an effect elsewhere.
Butterfly effect.

Creating a cold front on the wrong day invites disaster.
9related to the Fluttershy effect
Yeah.
9it's a common condition that rapidly accelerates the bronification process
hmmm that sounds like a good fic title
Nice try Twilight
The Fluttershy Effect
That could be the title of my idea.
9but upon Twilight's first encounter with Fluttershy, new watchers experience an overwhelming amount of D'Awwwwww

I love this version of the song. Where do I find it?
It's so jazzy

Search jazz nyan on youtube.
I have no idea
Lawl.
Ray, you should triple that time and that is my playtime atm XD
annoying.
image doing this in a restaurant
as a band
Oh my Celestia. It is "Nyan Cat - Smooth Jazz Cover"
and there is also piano in the real one
0Jazz Nyan...I like it
I know. It is amazing. I want to play it on my tenor
the thing that is most idyllic in the world of my little pony are the cutie marks
02Of SMG2?
atm yes .-.
idyllic?
02You took to long xD
i died so many times
U mad viewers?
02I died like... 7 times .-.
and i was mostly just goofing off
lol
they represent a fulfillment of a dream that most people have but few ever fulfill
02Mostly on those mokey challanges
0why would I be mad?
02monkey*
oh okay
finding a purpose
also speaking of Ninty stuffs, any requests for SSS XD
jah
Stops you from using the word.
02Hmm...
What word?
0what word?
pony
02maybe something from SMG's OST
Whatever you ban, I put pony.
Leverage?
okies
pony
any specific
Except the module's not installed on this IRCd.
02OH NO NO NO
also idk if ill allow pokerequets this week XD
0SO I wont be able to say Pony? That sucks
Id sing along but the spam filter would kick me
02Something from Super Mario 64
And it is the cutie marks that are likely a major reason that their society is so . . . perfect.
cant you read?
02Nostalgia'd
No. I can't.
kk
cool
0I wonder if I can find a loophole for it, block that word and Ill see what I can do
At least, not that blue text.
cutie marks are the thing I would most like to exist in the real world
And Sprinkles damn purple text.
SSS this week is a trial show week XD
lolwat?
02the ONLY good thing that I won't forget easily of SMG2 is that stage remake of King Thomp (or however is spelled)
mostly cause im gonna try out new broadcasting software
02Niiceee~
by adolescence, all people would find the thing that makes them special, and content
yes, it was Hard to get used to

Original Leverage thread has been marked for deletion.
02N64 all the waaaay
make him say "fuck the police"
look its chief
9so the brief and meteoric rise of Leverage comes to a fiery end
03nah
14http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36196421.html
awesome
Hmm...okies ill throw throwback galaxy in as well ;p
14GET IN HERE
14NOW
03Bob-Omb Battlefield is so much better
14FOR LEVERAGE
thats true ;p
0Maybe you should do a different tactic with the leverage thread, try using the Cyclon picture so people might get it
12lolz
i dont get it
03sigh
OK, I'll have 3 versions of the same song in the show how bout that! *shot*
14http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36196421.html
03my fingertip is bleeding
to just imagine how different this world would be if, well not only so explicitly being shown what makes each of us special were so, but even if there was just such an emphasis on that process.
03makes typing painful
ah better
12Cool Coom Mountain ~w~
thanks
12*Cool
XD
how the fuck do i reply?
K
Aren't you going to get a perm ban if you keep ban evading?
So 2 songs from SM64, one remix by me, and one from SMG2
Alrighty!
Speaking of which, how would any pony even play a woodwind?
/me is counting them as requests anyways
I did in middle school.
Also, goodnight.
special mouthpieces(reeds?).
Still, being banned on sight isn't exactly fun.
0I never use proxies
And cya Nittany_Tiger1.
and dragon you mean
hmm...lol fine, ill throw in Cave Dungeon (Full Version) in as well XD
not pony
Played clarinet, so yes.
0I can use them but I decide not to use it at all
good point sotha
14and they'll get tired of it eventually
I guess
Sotha plays clarinet, bassoon, and saxophone. She would be very sad as a pony.
Trololo
im trying to play the guitar, been going at it for 2 years
Cya.
The reeds of Saxs and Clarinets are similar IIRC.
But Saxs have larger ones.
Instruments... I hated music class so much. >_<
Anyway, I'm gone.
They can be used interchangeably in most cases
i hated music class too
i would have failed if it were possible
I had an idea on how ponies could ply instruments like guitars without being supported
0This is the only thing that will drive me insane
*play
Alto sax / alto clarinet, tenor sax / bass clarinet, soprano sax / soprano clarinet
Trololo.
unicorns can do anything
Until Intermediate Microeconomics, Music was the only class that I ever failed...
03LOL iTunes y u no be honest
also, ponies would have thier own insutments
yeah...
03"iTunes LP is for computers running iTunes 9 or later only"
fuck spelling
03orly?
03I use Winamp 2.91
03they're just mp4 audio >_>
I bet ponies could play the theramin well.
eeyup
lmfao you're using an old winamp? XD
anypony ever see a contrabasssax?
imagine the insurments, pretty much durms would be the only insturment that would be pretty much the same
03yes.
03the new ones suck
xD
I've only seen up to a Bb bass sax in real life
03also I have a reason for using 2.9x
;o
03if you look up adplug
they are really big
12connection bork
03it's a plugin that lets you play .imf audio files
03which is what old DOS games use
03XD
03and yay old video game music?
I could imagine. But I think I'll stick to the bassoon (so much fun to play)
9aight I'm sleepin now
9g'night bornies
9wow
9typing fail
Night.
night
good night
Night DS
0Apple spice, I NEED TO BUY IT!
i totally wanna play the double bass
um
sounds so cool
me too
03oh god this new OneRepublic music video is giving making me dizzy
03stupid picture inside picture crpa
03*crap
and ever other instrument
I can only play the ukulele; but if I had a choice, I would play the chello.
I play the drums
and now that htread is gone too.
why human bodies and pony heads?
I do not like that picture
drums are cool
fun
0What has science Done?!
i dont know many drummers
03and fail @ radio stations
very fun
So much coordination between your limbs.
03they made it sound like this song was new as of a couple weeks ago
03but the music video's been auround since Feburary... :/
but my school has 5.9 million guitar players
so any drummer can be in any band he wants
as long as its only with guitarists
our guitar program is awesome
CATS - THEY HAVE LEVERAGE!
We should watch one of the good parodies?
i dont get it

oh look EqD
0Hey, I have that site on my tab right now
dat EqD
hahaha you get ads
so do i
adblocker ftw
I like adds.
They support websites and help keep things free.
i like aids
Yup. First tab.
yeah
0Ads! I have ad blocker! I fear no ADS!
i installed adblocker today actually
No they don't.
03and the song itself has been around since before Febuary 2010 o.o
Depends on how the ads are set up.
#6 was funny
depends.
but usually
ooooo green
its because of popularity of the song probably
Well a lot of sites have per page view adds.
Since it's 100% Blogger, I assume it's all Google Ads.
And that's click-only.
03well yeah
03it's just odd when radio stations have that much lag
why does EqD allow shit fanfics on their site?
yeah
03I love listening tot he radio to hear about 'new' songs such as this one but seriously wtf
i mean, have they even heard of editors?
03it's on the same album that Secrets was on
and i dont even listen to public radio anymore
03which was on the radio like last year
most of whats on there is god awful
03I do
they do
03but I like top 40 so eh
You don't want to see the stuff they don't allow.
they have tons
TONS
so many errors
i swear i tell my sister more than once to turn her crap down
i cant read it
it hurts my head
I have an idea stream the Luna Game
and she has that radio blasting just to annoy me .-.
oh well, i should probably go to bed now
03hmm
Ok, cya Bjornfot.
03doing something just to annoy someone else
03you wouldn't do that, now, would you?
bye bye
/me hides
i;p
;p*
So far as I understand, they do not have editors so much as a team of pre-readers who make suggestions to the authors or something.
i'll only get 11 hours of sleep if i want to catch today's stream ;_;
03give your sister a high 5 for me
Nou
Bye all. May the Leverage be with you!
I use 5 because it has format converter & auto-tag
ONLY 11 hours he says.
What is happening in the stream right now anyway?
03eh
0I am getting tired at my end as well, cya guys tomorrow, bye ;)
Nothing, waiting for suggestions.
03auto tagging sucks
Nothing, the stream is offline
tbh, she hates me entirely
03iTunes does auto tagging and I've seen lots of typos in there
Stream's online btyw.
03especially for Pokémon music
btw*
uhhh
I've made several suggestions.
The stream is online, he's just browsing EqD.
03I put my 2BA Master CD in my computer, iTunes thinks it's the spanish verson >_>
Oh, whoops.
lmfao
Luna game

03OH MY GOD
03Someone is trolling me
03this song tha tI cannot stand
03is on a CD I might need
03>_>
03Rolling in th eDeep, or as I call it, Trolling in the Deep
03because it's on the radio ALL THE TIME
03It's nothing like ANY other music on top 40 radio, WHY are htey playing it so much? :@
who sings it? XD
I haven't seen any yet, so don't ask which
03ADELE
03or someone
EW
03yeah
/me np: Nyan Cat - Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya! MP3@185kps
03it's just like that Black Horse and the Cherry Tree song
03I just hate those
luna game reaction video?
03I mean, guitar is cool but guitar + annoying female singing voice + nothing else just pisses me off
Fine, after this.
good
03now piano, that makes anything good

nvm then
03Promo Only is awesome, I used to collect their stuff
http://www.m0ar.org/3477
03now I just get their occasional release
03pirated of course since I can't legally get them
03YOU might be able to :P
03basically they only sell to DJs
lol
XD
03and when I say sell I mean SELL, the CDs cost like $40 EA>CH
03which for 20 songs is NOT worth it
I'm that THAT professional of a DJ you know
XD
03so I just pirate them
03you don't need to be professional
What is this video about?
03you just have to be able to prove that you're a DJ
03otherwise I'd sign up and just lie
Reaction video to the Luna game.
reaction to the luna game
damn you
03luckily a lot of people sell Promo Only stuff on ebay for much lower than retail price so I've snagged up loads from that
03the nice thing about PO is that lots of times they have songs beore they're officially released.
wut i really want that is professional is some good jingles and Station IDs
03that, and their Mainstream Radio series generally has the clean "radio edit" versions which can be hard to find for lots of songs :P
/me might go to RPC Audio for that
;p
this is boring
what is it
03you could always do what Meijer did
03let me see if I can find it
what is the luna game

MP4box is the CLI. you might have better luck
Winamp can read anything

i just did ipconfig release renew
what
hes just taking everyhting.. cant even space me 10KB/s
just type ipconfig and take the ip
you should be able to temp ban his ip from the routers page
take what ip?
when you type ipconfig it should give you a list
if i wanted to do that I could just disable wifi in the router
what
then do it
he will get mad at me >_>
hes sleeping
he wont know
i need to just limit his down speed so he wont know
just re-enable it later
if i cut his internet it will pause all his torrentsd
oh

what time does SS' show start here, lighty?
Around 9 pm
im very tempted to unplug internet n plug back in'
But i always tune in on 8:30
pm
a few days ago he disabled the wifi on the router and would tell me

04Seriously, I want the Harry Potter 7 score now
OR ELSE U WILL DIE
O_O
03then go download it
i made a PMV
04Once I find it I shall
03want me to find it for you? give me like 20 seconds :P
04Transformers 3 had a nice score as well.
04Sure
03funny you should say that.
03I'm trying to find the actual CD of Transformers 3 score
04I actually have enough space on my laptop to do so now XD
03I already have them in mp3 form
04Oh really?
03but I'm trying to find the actual disc
03for some reason, Amazon is sold out
03like completely sold out
04For a second I thought you were gonna bash it LOL
03so I'll look elsewhere
03nope
04H-uh
03I love Transfurmers
03why would I bash it
04I've never known a movie score to be sold out
04Because you bash alot of things XD
03http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XKR6NC/ref=dm_dp_cdp?ie=UTF8&s=music
03see wha tI mean?
03I don't know why either
03and I also don't know why it says import o_O
04I also love how all the Transformers movies got horrible ratings but were smash hits at the box office
03I know right
04It's almost amusing
im back and the internet has went back to normal
03http://www.filesonic.com/file/1444806774
03enjoy
04Hey, upgrade to premium! Don't want to wait? Upgrade to premium! Want a faster download? Upgrade to premium.
04PREMIUM EVERYWHERE
03XD
03just do the free one
03I mean, I have premium but :P
04And thanks
04Yeah, I don't really mind waiting another 30 seconds.
03np
04I'm used to it with the YT mp3 converter
03WHY THE F*** ARE THERE NO TRANSFORMERS 1 OR 3 SCORES ANYWHERE?!?!?!?!?!
03and LOL converting, fail
is is a cool song http://www.myspace.com/video/566764070/my-little-eurodancer-pony/107761737
04Well it's the only way (I can be bothered) to get some of the tracks I want
dfr, what if i saaw TRANSFORMERS_DARK_SIDE_OF_MOON without seeing the previous 2 ?
03it would be fine
04Because most of the time I only want a single track from the album/score.
03but I would suggest seeing the other two
03why
the other two didn't intrest me
for some reason she closed her youtube account and put vids on myspace
03eh, I'm a quality wh*re so Ir efuse to download crappy quality uploads then convert them to even worse quality.
03the first one is definitely worth seeing
04Like with God of War - I don't want all of the cinematic/non-battle music.
03I thought the second was good but a lot of people here didn't like it for some reason
i saw the M3 trailer and i was like...
04Fair enough drf
cool, moon landing alternate history
03yeah, that was awesome XD
03I mean
03NO SPOILERS
04drf, I liked the second - more story than the first.
03same here
03I liked all 3
03they were all equally good
03but some people like Articuo hated it
03+n
043 had a bit too much action (not that I'm complaining) and some nice plot twists
this video on the stream is giving me a headache
inb3: mmichael bay's scene cuttting
03oh yeah @ plot twists
03I was actually surprised at some parts
lol.
04For the whole 2 1/2 hours about 2 were spent on fighting scenes XD
04Ditto
04<SPOILER> YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT YOU SONNUVAGUN
03LOL
I'm trying to find the actual CD of Transformers 3 score < the city cinema sells them at e tickets desk
O.......K.......
*the
03you can always type spoilers 3,3 like this
Dang
04Which cinema? Because no cinema in Aus does that
03wait, what? They sell actual CDs?
owait, that's the OST, not score
right?
03probably.
03the OST is just a bunch of random crappy songs :/
04Aus cinemas are crap and way too expensive.
03some review on Amazon said they weren't going to release the physical CD until the Blu-Ray comes out o_O
wut?
04$13 bucks for a single ticket. I can get cheaper at Dumaresq street. $5 per person.
03but for some reason
03the original Transformers score has vanished too
03all I can find are used copies from $120 and up
03which is stupid
04o_O
04lets go to the pirate bay... dot org
03again I have them all already but I want them physically
03again I have them all already but I want them physically
/me runs
03woah
04dat dang arrow key
03I just realized I have something that doesn't have flac rips on what.cde
03-e
03as an actual cd
03I shouldupload it
03+space
04I understood nothing of what you just said.
03http://what.cd/torrents.php?id=38228&torrentid=436026 <- the expanded score.;
it's a private torrent tracker
04And lol, this is expected of me.
go ahead
04I look at the download just as it hits 34%
03well I'm not doing so right now
03but I own that expanded score
03thing looks like a bootleg XD
03>pixelated album cover
03and I mean, it's like that. Mine's an official factory pressed CD. but an import from somewhere that obviously doesn't care about quality.
I think that who ever made that video, was on some hard stuff.
04i.e. somewhere in C-
03...
04No I won't make that joke
04A bit cruel
03I see FLAC rips of Transformers 3 score
here's another word: FLACcebo
03How is that possible?
03if there's not actually a CD?
03inb4 someone robbed a warehouse
04XD
inb3: my 720p rips off HDmania of not-released BDmovies
03but those would be TV recordings.
03or something like I did with Apple TV
no, some are BDrips
03supposedly.
a few weeks early
03I can call anything a BD rip
03oh
03well yea
03a few *weeks*
03not *months&
03**
like, people working in the factory, borrow a disc for a few hours, copy, return
04Download speed: 78kb/s
04kill me
03XD
04It's usually around 200kb/s
04And I don't have anything else downloading
03that's probably because free filesonic limits your download speed.
04...It does it on purpose?
04BASTARDS
03Yes it does
03that's the 'joy' of file sharing websites
03but at least I found it :P
03anyway it's 5am
02[The current time where I live is 0305:02:2802 on 03Saturday, 07/16/201102. I am in 03Eastern Standard Time02, also known as 03GMT -5 Hours02.]
03I should probably get to bed.
04It's basically pay or gtfo
03yeah.
04Or they torment you until you pay
04either way
03that's what the world turns to, money.
04Anyway g'night drf
03bye
So what's on the schedule when the next stream starts?
The next stream is a re-stream of the last content, at a more eu-friendly time for anyone who can't make the first stream or anyone who wants to watch it again :P
Ah, ok
Well, yeah, I did fell asleep before the Godfather last night
Come join us in the re-stream if you want to see it then :P
as it says up top, it's in 8 hours, or 7pm british time, or 2pm east coast USA
^^
That'd be 9PM for me (GMT+2, Finland)
More reasonable than 2AM at least, heh

greetings
'sup?
nothing at all you
Just coding a game I've been working on
ah cool
Probably gonna go and play Demon's Souls though
did dari just leave it on some YTP playlist
and also once i got plat on demon souls, as much fun as i had with it, i can't sit through it again
Yeah, I guess he did
And well, I'm at 2-1 myself, because I got the game recently
as i said pretty fun game, bu you will see, once you do some stuff for everything it becomes tedious and really taken advantage of
Yeah, I know
But well, games can't really go forever, sadly
also it was funny when people try to troll your world and you use armor/weapon rapping armor just to destroy their stuff xD
agreed
Well, I haven't let anyone to enter my game yet, since I followed my buddy's advice to wear that ring that gives you 25% more health in the "dead" form and killed myself in nexus after beating the first boss
It kinda creeps me out how there are ton of bloodstains in Nexus, heh
xD people became pansies if they need to killed in the nexus xD
also my friend became so unsure of a boss so much he kept helping others untill he figured out how to beat him for real
Haha
Not a bad idea, for sure
What stage is that?
forgetting his name
much later then where your at
Yeah, figured
Unless it was 1-2 or so
but the guy kept sapping your highest stat points
That sounds kinda weird
Is it a permanent change, or?
he kept sitting back next to the entrance of the boss because he found of it so he can figure out a way to do dodge the attack, it comes out so fast
and yes permanent change
Ouch
just not to people who come into th world
the**
hold on let me get the name of it
Ok
im glad my volume is low right now OWA is such a over played song
or this streams volume**
Well, I've muted the stream myself
well i can't seem to find any information on the person who does the attack
but its one of the bosses you will see
he is a pain
Oh well, I'll probably find out sooner or later
also last boss all you need is the weakest bow and you can win
And well, at least I've some patience with tedious/annoying bosses, thanks to Monster Hunter

It's something like +250 hours in MHFU, +220 hours in MHTri and something like +50 in MHF1. Dropped MHF1 right after I started to get good at it, since MHFU launched around that time in Europe

Is it true that city is a dying, abandoned city?

lolwut
BOHNANA?

Well, the actual stream starts in less than 7 hours, so it doesn't come surprising

lol
Do we get to request?
If he's around, maybe?
He isn't?
I dunno
normally no, half the time we are not alowed to do this, not sure how sprinkles and the rest of the mods will react
Well, yeah
I'll just work on my song in the meanwhile.
guess I'll get back to coding now
See if I can't make a good solo :I

And then we all /worked/

Ah, I'll still be in the chat.

Wait frak
i can't go to sleep any time soon
Where are ya from, then?

greetings fellow euro furs
i mean bronies
Lol
*shakes sleep from my head*
you know what sucks, they made SCII region locked x.x
StarCraft?
yup
Yeah, I heard about it from a buddy of mne who plays it
Any region locking is annoying as hell
So screw you Nintendo for region locking 3DS
Freaking locks.
At least I've modded PS2 so that I can import games for it, but still
Maybe I should just play a game.
I would've missed games like "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors" if it wasn't for the region free
Though, DS is easy in the aspect that you can just get a flash card for it, but still
i hope soon we make more region free games, like we have now, or have blizzard understand this
but really the 3DS is region locked
It is, it is
And it's annoying because handhelds thus far have always been region free
At least on Nintendo's and Sony's part
And PSVita is going to be region free, so yay for that

I have my iPod touch that is still in warrenty jailbroken :P
Hmmm.
which gen is it?
iPhone 3G :(
I intend to get the new iPhone coming out later this year when it's out
that's what my dad and I are looking to get on ebay
we just want one for cheap so we can mess around with it
I bet it's going to be somewhat like the iPhone 3GS in terms of the amount of upgrades
a few minor internal tweaks to make it better
like the A5 processor
Damn the MLP:FiM Videos on my iPhone took up too much space
Need to delete some of them off :(
How many GB is it?
I'll be back later

13The new Barclays advert is finally on Youtube |D

13Somehow I STILL picture Skylands as a shiny Eevee

13my mind makes no sense .w.
Oh, inwanted to ask that sky
Donyou have a picture of your character?
10Yus, lighty

Floof is always good
10The more the merrier
Floof is deathly

Suffocate on floof

06Zorua is certainly the dark type equivalent to an eevee.

So much leverage spam yesterday.
After Sprinkles left I started streaming the pig film.
Viewers were mad.
XD
DARI
YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD
9that is genius
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!
Looked like the funniest film ever.
ALIENS CAME AND BLASTED MAH PIE
9but that is also painful genius
9that said
9we're live.
9this is a test stream of something I might stream in the future
9warning: keep tissues handy
Ok.
8megusta.jpg
8we arent live XD
13The person who pictured you as an Eevee girl was me, Sky :P /late
9So Dari
8its a black bg for me
9you can stream, right?
Yeah, you're using the mibbit I guess
Yeah, my sound's really quiet though.
10Ah
Even though it's full volume on my computer.
It's white BG for me, since I'm using my client program
Yeah, you get used to the yellow on white Poniator. :P
9testing audio
o.o
9how is it?
I see video, hear no audio.
Perhaps I should just switch the bg color for this channel
/me falls over and lols
8i hear quiet static, no game audio
There we go
What's this?
9Tender, Unmanly Tears: The Game
9Hipster, how about now?
*sneaks away from the scene*

9gimme a sec
10Stealth*
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/36197681.html
9sorta, it IS a VN but really more like a movie
8it has begun
Alright
I like VNs myself, especially "9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors"
This thread. It needs more leverage.
9Oh, that's a great one
Unfortunately that means having to make leverage.
9also, I have a problem with Stereo Mix
9gimme a sec
9it needs more leverage
/me makes leverage.
Let's just get some beverages
06:3
8i need to screencap this movie and make more image macros
9I think I know what the problem is now
9gonna see if I can make another solution
INB4 we all get banned.
8XD
/me puts Espeon on her back D:
9there
9press play
9so I have to use my Speakers
9gotta find a solution for that
9I was quite digging using headphones
9testing audio
10Woop
12!floof
9report?
12hi Skylands
I can hear some dem music
Stream won't load for me.
Oh wait.
There we go.
Yeah, I hear it.
12:)
9roger
8i hear it
/me brees all over you
9setting this thing on autoplay
/me breefloofs
9I want you guys to give me your opinion on this
/me floofs feathers
So how is it more like a movie?
12heh
9and whether we should stream it sometime
9yeah, a movie you read xD
10Ohai Obsi
True, true
But isn't that VNs mostly are?
what*
So what game was this?
9yeah,but most other VN's have interactivity
9Narcissu
9it's freeware
COolio
And well, interactivity varies between games, yeah
How long is it?
9this is pretty much a Butterfly Circus, but with more despair
Policenauts and 999 are the best ones I've played so far
06Hihi
9not much, I think one can finish it in the time of a regular movie
Oh, cool.
9if you liked Policenauts, I hope you've played Snatcher
Maybe I'll give this a shot sometime
Yeah, I played Snatcher after finishing Policenauts
9Snatcher we'll stream here eventually
Ah, cool
And heh, I even boutgh Policenauts import after finishing the game
Too bad that two stickers and the spine card were missing, otherwise it'd be complete
Suddennly, louder music
9fixed my audio cable a bit
ok
But yeah, I guess I could give this game a shot sometime
Gonna go and finish my coding for today now
1,14o8°4o
12hi
good morning every pony
9why hello there
i see prince is not streaming anymore x3
or not sure if he is *shrugs*
Its' DCD
It's*
not colored dari?
9you feel relieved there's no pigs in the stream?
It was Bjornfot's suggestion.
06Breeface
06and :33
8i should have known
Haha. XD
He must be in league with Tacowiz.
/me 8makes a note to check their IP's today
he made dari make me have a lobotomy this morning he made him play spiders web
Heheheh.
8also, dari, did you stay up all night?
semi
Nah, I fell asleep when I put the stream on some playlist at about...
he just left on some YTP and left or something
9 am.
8damn man
*shoots dari hard with a hand cannon* don't listen to bj again
Next time I should stream the whole thing. :P
awwww
why did you go and do that
:P
so far i can tell he broke a decent amount of rules *shrugs*
but i guess it depends on all your looks on it
8accidental quads on /chat/, like a boss
i thought it was a system between you all to agree to allow a stream to be unscheduled and play it
like no one does anything until everypony hears about it on staff
hello there!
3rd movienight in row
8i was asleep before dari even started streaming it, so i couldnt have known XD
I was the only mod left at the time.
Even Sprinkles had left. XD
i know x3
thats why i brought up that point
because our group for D&D (still going with it hipster if you wish to join any time) with sprinkles in, wanted to watch a movie/pony marathon, but he said no because you guys had to discuss it between eachother
so thats what confused me
8well, major stuff like that we do
8but that was technically part of post-show
Oh hey the stream's on...
well dari wanted to start a pony marathon until he was convinced to play lots of odd stuff by DJ
or that person who normal troll on here
I only streamed the pilot episodes.
nais
Because I knew that I'd get in trouble for streaming anything we hadn't just watched.
well first beginning episode and half of the second and you broke in with spiders web
Heheh.
8wait
8you interrupted PONIES for spiders web?!
Eeyup.
/me is winning troll.
*face hoofs*
8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/131083054993.jpg
thats why i got a lobotomy early morning
so curious how did he become a mod *chuckles*
I became a mod by being useful. :P
8because he is the chatroom
*shrugs*
7Goodmorning
9hey Sathi
8sup sathi
7what are we watching?
13!espeon
Someone should really get a GIF of the "madness? *Kick*" scene in the 300 and put Trollvolta's face onto Leonidus'.
Madness?
THIS IS LEVERAGE!
8brilliant
9Sathi: a visual novel
9Narcissu
9really sad
so far it has been
9just testing to see if you guys think it's a good idea to watch
9oh, it gets worse
8honestly i havent really been following it
9anyways, this is the sort of thing you should watch from the start
its very beautiful regardless
9so I really think that to stream it, we'd need to set a time and date
/me awakens
12noooooooooo\
12hi
13ohai SS :3
Heya ss
I couldnt find a proper request for this week, im sorry
9and that's it for the preview xD
9I'll be back in a sec
9but going offline
9so what do you think?
9is it worth a try?
8hmmmm
8i kind of had a hard time getting into it
8cuz i tend to check other tabs
7yes me too.. came into the channel and had no idea what I was watching
13I have a request :D
PM it or Message Me on MSN :3
9yeah, needs more search
9anyways brb
There were people calling for GoKaiger yesterday BTW DCD.
13Just reminded myself I need to buy/play Kirby's Epic Yarn
13every time I see in shops I'm like "waaaaaant D:"
i still dont have that game ;-;
9Dari: my plan is to stream Gokaiger before every stream
9and OOO's after every stream
9I mean, movie night
9so yeah
Yarn?
9we'll get back on schedule next week
*yawns*
Cool.
9albeit maybe I could do a Toku Day on one of these days
mhm
9k brb

http://i.imgur.com/LXzbi.jpg
I can see why you stopped watching the movie ;)
Yeah, there was quite a lot going on.
>500 leverages.
612 leverages were leveraged on that day.
bahahahahahaha
8unrelated, but funny: http://i.imgur.com/FY7vV.jpg
Oh wait.
That was matching case.
MORE LEVERAGES
wut
Actually there were 1210 leverages.
...
Damn.
geez :o
did you counted ?
Pedobear approves of this.
holy hell
they made a pony mod for Dispenser music and ponies
Can pedobear be gay?
I just used the count function on a text editor (I have everything logged)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Ka4jjrPHc&feature=player_embedded
We need gay counterpart of pedobear
oh :)
8he doesnt discriminate based on gender
Ah, I was wonder, because all the pedobear images I've seen involve girls
Might be because internet is all guys though, esp. on 4Chan
Yeah, pretty much
And that's pretty much why I think pedobear as straight
Same
So
so so
no sign of Sprinkles yet?
Hihi
7nope
im nearly out of room for requests XD

13It's like FEAR but better |D
I'm worried over the fact Sprinkles hasn't arrived yet
8hes never here this early on saturdays
Thats not cheating
Tjats pure strategic thinking
8he usually doesnt show up until after 1:30
8at least
6I saw that before, AE. :P
/me 6has a legitimate Shiny Aron just for that. XD
Sprinkles started streaming about 6 hours before the stream was due to start yesterday.
good leverage
Yeah, he has quite a lot of leverage.
8more than 6 hours XD
8he startde streaming at like 9:30 am
13Also, just got DW Espeon with pretty good IVs in all stats apart from Sp. Attack
13Timid nature and 31 IVs in speed
13which is what I wanted, but
13how much will those bad IVs on sp attack affect it? D:
06Special attack is kind of Espeon's thing, but I'm not the one to ask |D
13Yeah I was aiming to get amazing stats in speed since I know that espeon's sp attack is naturally its highest stat anyway

Switching to pc

10damn those spys
Guess I'll play BlazBlue over the MLP episodes and get back for the movies
why have it then
10I had ubercharge ready ;-;
I see
guys you should seriously see nostalgia critic's review of battlefeild earth
03because it was part of the Valve Complete Pack
6Ah, yes, spies.
I've seen it, can't remember any of it
6Spycheck, then. :P
8dont really care for the nostalgia critic
06what it does to peaople? o.O
06people*
:O
12lol
12drf hates everything
03Espeon, yeah as in, they spend all day playing it
I gotta say, were it not for the leverage, last nights BMN would probably have been the worse
12making his opinions invalid
is it because he's mainstream?
12:)
03I already have enough to do
6Firefox is borking. :|
03let alone play some silly highly addictive game all day
6Give me a moment.
leverage?
03it's like smoking or doing drugs. :P
Leverage
12i have it and i rarely play it drf
You will see
9LEVERAGE.
8its because hes obnoxious and tries way too hard
12i have wow and i rarely play it
Not a surprise SL :<
It won't be as frantic as it was last night though
12i have the world's most addicting games and i'm not addicted to it lol
Well some people are weak minded :D
03well Feather obviously is :P
06Lol I don't find it that addictive and all.
03and LOL, this is why you don't use mibbit, then you don't get kicked off IRC when your browser freezes. :P
06whoa what
06102.1 hrs past 2 weeks
06what are you doing feather
/me dies
03see what I mean
03and I know a few people IRL
03who would spend all their free time playing it
10LOL whoa
10have I really played that much
03I was like "Jeez, learn to do something else"
06I have like 160 from ... when did I get it, march or something? xD
i have none ;D'
06But hey I'm guilty of being like "lol have I played this much?" with other games >->
Ohai SirLeverage
i dont play Steam games much to be honest
03I don't play PC games much
i dont really get addicted to games
8btw, DCD, you should be able to join the mod channel now
ohai Dari
03I play plenty of Valve games, I just do so on Xbox 360
6TF? Where's my auto-op?
03because yay achievements that actually countg?
03-g
03Steam achievements are just like "LOL LOOK A SHINY THING ON MY PROFILE"
So, Dari, how's your sexlife?
8did you sign in?
06>achievement
06>count
06what
6Eyup.
12Well i'm bored
12to gmod!
Hmm, you didn't have +O on apparently.
Oh well, I set it now.
8no colors
9roger that
inb4colorsareformods
06And I know, they're something to collect. I sometimes go hunting trophies and stuff when I'm bored too, so not being serious here :P
03ever heard of gamescore?
03*gamerscore
9you mean INAFTER bro
Don't you mean inafter.
03higher number, more bragging rights
how big is Drf's gamerscore
XD
...
03Steam achievements hardly even show up
03unless you go looking
03um
Dammit DCD.
:P
8dat herdmind
0320,000 or os
/me hides
03*so
:V
03LL has more than me though :|
06mmhmm
My gamerscore is 0`
I never game anyway :D
03she was kinda mad that I beat her to 10,000 but eh
06i bet he cant even beat me in UT 2004
Was typing it as he was, he pressed enter before
03lu
Result: Herpidy derpidy
lmfao, i know someone whos on over 50k
03I don't like first person shooters
Dari, just manual OP me...
03so of course you'd beat me
06i figured xD
06One thing I love is people who have insane gamerscore / rare items / UNUSUAL HATS
06but SUCK at the actual game
03LOL
03I'm not terrible at the games I have all the achievements in
06of course, to be hoinest NO ONE has ever beaten me in a UT game
06and i mean, no-one
lol does anyone know of the 11 year old from the UK that bought way too much off of XBL
06Not saying that either, but especially with the unusual hats in tf2
02You
02Me
02UT
02Now
06speaking so much trash and they probably haven't spent more than 10% of their game time outside of trading servers
02:3
06if you wish
03well I tend to achievement farm just to get completes XD
03but eh
06or was, rather
06to be honest, give me dual enforces or a flak gun
06and the
06*then
06SPLATSJ!
03LOL flak guns
03I love the impact hammer
03mopst epic thing ever
/me runs
03*most
03^ LOL, classic trash talking
06Role playing games know to make the silliest achievements sometimes
Most gamers are trash talkers
06hehe
03I generally just admit to not being very good
:p
hmm anyone else got kicked / booted from the chat?
06before you can even zoom in its like
06OHSHI-
06ripperzz
nope
02I don't zoom lol
06trash talking isn't bad as long as it's relatively friendly competition and not outright sh*t talking :P
03I play for fun, not to get lots of wins
02I use another playstyle
could not connect at all
02xD
kept getting terminated error
06mmhmm
I play offline and by myself
03collecting achievements != being a pro
As that is the most fun D:
06what do you call that playstyle then?
That's... completely random.
weird
ah oki
9inafter inafter
Morning sprinkles
7There we go.
06mine actually has a name, RETARD style :P
It's morning?
/me runs
greetings sprinkles
02Running around, not zooming, switching to a shock rifle when miss the shot
I never slept last night...
yea ;)
6Hey Ruben
well it's evening actually but woke up an 1 hr ago ;)
so morning
7So, what'd I miss? :P
nothing really :P
7Really, now?
I think I'm going crazy, ruben's text looks slightly pinkish
03just people claiming to be pros at Unreal Tournament, basically.
06only me bragging overdosis
brb, gonna grab lunch quick before the stuff starts
Nope, just going crazy
02nah
06xactly
02I'm not at pro xD
02-t
06I love telling people who say that they are pro that they aren't unless they play for cash
nah your just going crazy
06For some reason it makes them upset to hear a proper definition of a word :P
/me flops
03who plays for cash o_O
03that seems silly to me
02A lot of people, lol
Big time.
Is this only ever on fridays/saturdays?
03hence proving my theory that the majority of people are stupid.
06stuff like
7Lol.
7Competitive versus pro?
6Unless we do an event, yes.
7On a random note, my bedroom window is a natural beetle trap.
Ok shame I missed all of them upto last week
7Beetles drop in, and they can't fly out.
I just down right missed all of them.
03kill them all >:|
eat them
7They're already dead.
03EW eating them
7Except for this really large one that looks like some cockroach.
06get a spider
06or something
6Preshow, it is running.
06a big one
06om nom nom
/me dies
03Ugh
/me grossed out
7Eh, that's possible.
03good time to to go shower
03bbl
03shower then errands
06:p
6And by that I mean have fun watching Luna dance to music for a while. : D
/me leaves
;p
10XD
Trolols
Why would you kill beetles?
Beetles are awesome.
for 23 minutes.
7I don't intentionally kill them. O_o
I think we can do that ^.^
6We watched Gummy for over two hours last week...
7My window just happens to act as one when it's closed.
03wait
03what
03are you using background colors
i see how leverage went crazy...
Maybe, it's inconvenient to switch it off when going back and forth between servers.
03oh
03OK
How'd I go crazy?
7Another server that allows background colors?
03was going to say, that's not allowed here.
7And I thought we were flexible. O.o
03though, are you using mIRC?
watching gummy for 2 hours?
7yep.
03there's a simple script fix to make it not use background colors here.
I don't go on any other servers that don't allow background colours. O_o
7Why, light?
there we go
Yeah, I'm using mIRC.
7last pre-show we watched 2 gummies for 2 hrs
03TST is the only place I've ever been to that DOES allow colors
My friend watched epic jazz guy for over 4 hours
oh, i'm on UT now, litterly
Oh, I wasn't here for last weeks show :P
03most IRC channels are just plain text.
And Nyan cat for over 16
7literally?
UT has a irc client build in
03yes literally.
in the multiplayer section
7that long Nyan cat.. and kept your sanity?
7I was talking to light.
What?
I never said he kept his sanity
i'm assuming he webt mad
Wow, I've never seen allow any colours, and all the ones I go on don't stop you from using background colours either. O_o
7hehe
03or something
He does that...
6I watched Nyan cat for 25 hours... I regret nothing.
I have listened to Epic Sax man for 5 hours straight though
:D
bai :<
Nyan Cat for 10
I still want to marathon the longest video on youtube with my friend.
i tried 10 hours, gave up after 25 mins
might dc updating virtual box
if so brb
Meh, I think I'll just use $active in the current colour script I have.
I have been playing jazz nyan non stop on my ipod now for 3 days now though...
So... Pirate time?
03whatever you prefer. Just letting you know you can;'t use background colors here :P
03you can use that dark blue if you want though
Fitting
Ohai SilverMane.
1 LL uses 12 this
:p
03so do loads of other people
Did you and RainBroDash get married yet?
2 But yay darkblue
:)
12hmm
what time will the films start? Im going for about an hour, will I miss much?
Of course not, you'd have been fitted for your bridal dress first
To be honest I like black best.
But I have to use colours on one place to stand out.
03>attention wh*re
>Bridal dress
Nah, it's because I'm a mod, and there are up to 300 people talking at once. :P
>Possible pun detected
The non-mods aren't allowed to use colours.
inb4 Leverage Spam
So people can see when mods are talking.
sigh leverage
03heh
03that's...weird
03I'm used to mods being treated as normal members of the community, not gods :P
Meh, it's a good system, it works.
Well if you saw the turbo chat there, you'd understand.
so you can't see the orange text I set?
No one would ever see what you said in just plain text.
03I'd probably derail it in seconds.
Derail it? LOL
03yeah
03as in start talking so much people are like o_O
Good luck with that.
03thanks.
03now I'm leaving for a while.

Spike and Big Mac are enemies fighting over the women of Equestria
I beleive in Leverage
hmm. b4 i go rainbow dash shirt or no?
Ogod, that sounds like a bad OVA
I raised my daughter in the Leverage fashion
in retrospect, we should have saved this to show parts 1 and 2 on back to back days as a special event
why isn't photoFINISHHIM on here?
6Yes, a boring weekend! Perfect!
Are we watching Godfather?
That's a cruel and unusual punishment
Aww
yep
Wear a RD shirt!
SO they beat her with leverage
Why would you do that, Hip?

6Speaking of events... we need to decide on what days we're doing LotR
godfather**
7well we could use more movie-theme nights
6Like, officially.
10i concur
why did he whiped
Godfather needs more leverage
You rang?
yes
I say August 26-28
:O
i agree
Trolololololol
A SPY WAS AMONG
6August 26-28 sounds good.
THE HELL DID I MISS YESTERDAY GOG DAMN
i'll punch you in face
4Godfather needs SO MUCH leverage for it to be entertaining
6I was thinking, we should do 3 eps each night, so it's not just a single movie.
4It needs a lot of leverage
Oh Hai
Q.;
7all lotr BMN then?
it needs to have about 20% mroe leverage
Oh hai
I remember the Rugrats did a parody of this scene during the second movie
6It's one each night.
those movies are long as hell though
maybe just 2 eps
NOOO
6 2 eps is fine.
But unlike Godfather, Hip, they're entertaining
Oh it's back
ahaha!
ghosties: both are entertaining
Damn, my internet's being really laggy today.
6Plus it'll give us something to have a lotto for the previous week.

At that time people where still hooked on CodWarfare2

4Yes
Sadly, yes
Well, ex~cuuuuuuuuuse me Princess, but this movie needs more leverage... sir.
looks like this is still the premovie
Because I know people want to see this scene ten times over
waiting for people to start getting shot

They had leverage
8cool story bro

More Leverage?

DSII button makes everything better

who's streaming
7wb is it fixed?
Did I hear Deathstalker 2 music?
8sprinkles, you have to get it cued up for the luca brazzi scene
4If this movie had Deathstalker and the Deathstalker sound effect, it'd be instantly gratifying
Oh god the rape sound effect!
whoever's streaming needs to play DSII over all the sound effects
it needs more leverage
