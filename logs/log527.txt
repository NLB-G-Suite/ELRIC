Never had a N64, I was born in 97 :)
PANCAKES
75 songs and 8.5GB
Ouch
CHOCOLATE!
O1-3
cartridges were awesome
;-;
ded
Hm
same songs as the torrent you got off TPB
except in surround
which is, no joke, an 8 hour static shot of the Empire State Building
that'll take me
10hrs
to download
given I can even get seeded at 250KB/S
/me cry
iwndr if i can HEAAC it at 192kps
Here's how you face book
/me Puts face in book
There you go :)
High-Efficiency
its designed for low-bitraest
03> ugh, well that sucks
03that's why it was erroring
03not because of wattage
yes
Okay.
If you have the time
Then sure
For some reason I havent been getting the newsletter on time.
if i do that, i could possibly get O1-3 downn to a few hundred megs?
but i need to figure out how to batch it
To CMD?
You guys thought that Epic Movie and Babes in Toyland were bad? YOU HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED WORHOL
Later than I should Saxy
batch it in f2k or dBPA
or some crazy ffmpeg like program
I mean
nah
As long as the download isn't > 1.5GB
Then I don't mind xD
it'll be based off qAAC, which is a CLI interface for qucktime AAC
Aha
quicktime is the best free AAC encoders
I'm surprised
Though apple loves AAC
:p
quality-wise
That'll be under 2GB
I would think
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196530/
Plot summary: "A single shot of the Empire State Building from early evening until nearly 3 am the next day."
lemme check
Meep
Merp
DOINK
BOOP
;)
0,14BONK
DING DONG
Glug Lug
kathoom
SHZZAMM
Kazzam. >D
:D
I guess each song would be 40-50MB @ average of 3mins
Unless I can't do math.
Best. Movie Title. Ever: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1488163/
unless my math is wrong
and it'll be 300MB
/me spazz
hey!!!!! no romance online
only romance to ponies
o_o
B-but I has a boifran.
ill be right back
:)
dis my last tiem online fotr a while :3

dammit~
lol
i dont think we have
maybe just passerbys
:3
wow never heard of it or seen it
also note, that some of the songs have problems, which i intend to fix some time later, afteri finish analyzing them
ow
(the problems are mainly to do with surround
no prob
I have all summer
i'll make some quickies soon for you to listen first,
:D
Thanks :p

11,01JRP2234: You don't say?
Such peaceful music..
litterer.
Seriously though, Breaking Bad season 5 is coming out in 3 weeka and I haven't even finished season 3 and 4...
that's usually how I get to Mun... equatorial orbit first, then punch it at moonrise.
now
minmus is tricker tho, but easier to land on when you actually get there.
WATCH THEIR FACES
then*
WATCH THEM CAREFULLY!
and look for the changes
hai everyone :D
00,10might skim the atmo on the perryopsis
that's... not a good lunar insertion orbit track... he's gonna have to do his lunar transfer at apop
or close to it anyway
how is everyponies night going?
00,10defentaly
00,10no this is nitt
00,10the Dash lets you know it's nitt
we can't hear you over the music, Nitt.
00,10indeed
mmhmmm
okay now it's alive
you're close enough, Nitt. The moonrise trick is really meant for a 150 km orbit anyway. Punch it.
hello
O:
hey Nitt, is SAW FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNN?
:)
so,how is everypony
Yup
Nitt you can control the ship from the map view directly. Tap that arrow at the bottom center
D:
(\
.... oh wait
WAAAAAAAAT
00,10ok that looked kinda cool
night all
00,10Cause you dont open the nav ball Nitt
yes you can throttle from map. The navball includes throttle control
00,10take note of the arrow at the bottome of the map
00,10and there is also you cant realy controll when at warp
:O
/me is begin ignored

00,02cow334, i do
you
no desktop pony :'(
I never asked for this
I like the protagonist's VA
00,02killerpony7733, i'm figuring it as i go
00,02his va creeps me out
00,02killerpony7733, i noticed that
00,02shot in the head
00,02and had a wall colapse on him
00,02wow, i just realised how boss jensen is
Like a faust
He survived all that even before he was a cyborg, impressive!
00,02JRP2234,
00,02JRP2234, i want to play this then tf2
00,02MadSurge, i have no clue
00,02he doesnt need them
Then they probably are to visualize all the stats
xD
dadaq
00,02it was only trank darts -_-
YES KILL EVERYONE
04Kill everyone, I like that option
00,02and the cary capacity
00,02killerpony7733, but.... vending machines
14back
00,02:<
/me 00,02is buying it
00,02and i want to get the carying capacity too
04Have fun!
00,02shotgun and sniper
00,02allso
00,02they dont give you enough tranq darts
00,02its quite anoying
/me never asked for this...he asked for tacos, tacos rule.
taco
tacos are awesome and sound cool
04I prefer taquitos. Yum.
screw the aromor go around naked like the ponies
mmmmmmm taquitos
they don't have em here in euroland, I believe
04Taquitos are like meat, veggies, and spices rolled up in a flour tortilla
ooo nice :D
I think I made something like that once :T
04It's kinda like a burrito
00,02for a moment i though i got away with that
04Same principle and junk
00,02cow334, not kill
00,02just punch
my hard no kills run was definately easier than my normal run before
04Just not folded
04Rolled instead of folded
but they just call em meat rolls or something.
<_>
the hardest part is not accidentally killing someone
cause you can kill with tranqs
00,02killerpony7733, i want to figure it
00,02thats the fun bit
crush him
00,02dis isnt working
Like a fausr
faust
00,02i screwed dat up
kill him
absolve
00,02option'
00,02k
00,02ok...
00,02cow334, NO :<
00,02dis jensen is a thinking man
00,02not a punching man
00,02though he does that allso
Is this a non-lethal playthough?
i always use absolvefirst
Deus Ex o.o
jensen doesn't punch people, he punches walls
tell him to think about the ponies
Meh. Just act as if you're in a relationship with him: Constantly agree.
its probably plead...
but sometimes you can always absolve
00,02i'm thinking plead
nonoon
but mabye
00,02dat didnt work
absolve, absolve, absolve
Yeah, I'm thinking absolve.
That
00,02yeah, dat didnt work
absolve alll the time
Just do pure absolve.
00,02i'ma try absolve until it doesnt seem right
IT'S INVISIBLE WAR.
00,02that was different
00,02that was a different line
damn randomization
00,02dere is random in dis
00,02yeah
show the options
Darnit!
00,02dat was dumb luck
O_O

You'r esaying you're not optimistic about homosexual rights based on a front figure?

08,01Vordox: no, i think it means that my subconscious thinks that everyone hates me because i like guys
PFFT
08,01or maybe because i talk about sex too much
Saturn: just like me only worse WAY worse
Dear roleplayers, please stop making my favorite character too in-character.
We, or anyone at all, have nothing to say about that.

did you know that in 18th century russia men were forced to shave their beards.
killerpony773 I'm just really feminine, and proud of it ^-^

08,01Vordox: when i came back from Germany, I learned 2 things
Saturn: indians have nice beards too :D
who's best pony
04Dear Hideo Kojima: Keep making Japan an awesome place.
killerpony773 Thank you ^-^
Saturn: Which was?
08,011) having a full-on beard does not bode well in an airport; 2) border control officers have absolutely no sense of humour
Saturn: You mean germany OR USA?
Oh Saturn You said you liked hot guys? :P
04Airport security and officials do *not* play about that shit, Saturn
I literally screamed when I some.
08,01or rather, 1) havin ga full-on beard does not bode well in an airport when you're brown
