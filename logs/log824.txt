DUMB ROCK

"...Todd, I love you"
OohShiny Help... I got an ad during the dynomite

Or maybe he was trying to parachute past the rock
kevin is a failure
00,10oh here we go
...FLASH BACK NANANANANANANANN
So far Tom 6 Todd 0
was this flashback necessary
Im so lost
:(
and cue forced morale
what the fuck is the point of this movie?
oh tod chan ive always had a spot for you
why do flashbacks have to be so bloomy
XD
this is technically a flash-forward
wait... a flashback.. in a movie that repeats
good thing we havent seen this scene like 10 times already
suddenly todd will be a nice guy totally out of character.
So
Todd X Kevin OTP
^^^
Did Tom win?
:D
He says he survived a lot worse... then they immediately cut to flashbacks of his past with his family. WAT
Douche Bag
of course he dd
"Till you feel better about my voice sounding so mellow...."
Toms a good guy after all!
Tom 1,234, Douche: 0
How warm and fuzzy
lol
no joke
fuck the police
Good guy Kevin
Tom > Todd
he took the oppurtunity to smoke a bunch of weed while alone to pick him up.
dat door bell
so is this a 12-hour loop?
So
Final day?
This is getting old...
does this thing ever end? :O
nope
Never
this movie will be on loop on stream forever
DAMNIT COMMERCIALS
Dawn of the Final Day. 24 hours remain.
twilight_sprinkle: noooooooooooo!!!
lol
OohShiny: Yeah that's what the character going through the loop always feels like too in this type of story
He has to mean what he learns
he's met with a terrible fate, hasn't he?
Hey guys /]
I run so fast in pokemon
lol
Okay
...Easy bake ovens are the SHIT
heya AJfan77 (\

Aaaaaah

alexxm kinda meh,got a cold :S
:$
I like that lady.
HARRY POTTER MUSIC!
Get it...cause she's a grandma who knows what PASTIES are
Yeah, I think the canonically weasily excuse for the Easy Bake Oven was probably the most proper excuse.
well that expolains my eerie attraction to the grandma
The awesome granny clause
SlyTag: no kidding
Every movie has one
Forever Alone guy now
hurry up already
Zues XD
so to end the loop
omg weather
Kandarihu The truth doesn't neccisarly make the gift BETTER...
how long has it been looping?
Rookeealding: Yeah like the Hostess Easy Bake Oven http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/hostess/1.jpg
Finally
THIRD IMPACT MUST OCCUR TO END THE LOOP
How to solve the problem: GET OVER IT!
he has to lay down and let this guy steal his gurl
Unless it's hilarious!
:| end already
Lol
If you could live one day forever, which day will it be? P.S theres no escape >=)
None
Darf14 I wouldn't
So, Todd used witchcraft to make sure that the old boyfriend would not see the next day till he accepted losing his ex?
Nope
Hey Everypony
Darf14: one day in Equestria
J_E_Smith71: I want
hi MissVenom
MissVenom: sup
...
MissVenom: hello!
FUCk you BITCH
Darf14 what would it matter, I could change it everyday
lol
wow
Now he's all self loathy :(
I'm with red letter media: live action humans acting like cartoon characters is annoying.
lel
Wow
:(
DICK JOKE
Todd "i'm a doctor, a WITCH DOCTOR!"
Darf14 the day after I find a portal that leads to equestria
Darf14: and I would be already friend of every pony in the show
howw do u live a day forever
"Hey, glad that you got married"
What should I name Pikachu?
"Hey, your penis is small, no thanks to your horrible marriage of me!"
i stopped caring about these characters in the first ten minutes
whooa!
Well this is sort of a bitter ending. Not bittersweet, just bitter.
Ouch
bull lady
yup
really lady? childbirth over and over?
GAYWADS
damn, that would be a painful loop
ouch
this ending sucks
Really?
really?that sounds painful to me
Darf14: Stop reading the script
full of dissapoint
Fuzzy
oni_link: Except the Twinkies and Cupcakes are really tiny: http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/hostess/3.jpg
painful day to pick
Hey! Thats I just said movie! :|
the day your son was born... BULLSHIT
this is cheesy bullshit
Cirno: Agreed
Really.... childbirth over and over again?
yup
She means the day AFTER, clearly. >.>
she must be a masoquist
J_E_Smith71: I need to feed my hostess fix
twilight_sprinkle at least in the groundhog loop, it wasn't the WORST DAY Ever for him...it was just a regular day for him
Rosfox: must be a masochist :P
what are we watchimg?
lol
what is this loop?
irony
okay
/me licks Bjornfot and otakon17
isnt child birth very idk PAINFUL
XD
...
Fuck you bitch
Hur hur
ouch
SEE
uhhhh
why are we talking about it?
or DOSE he
HES IN HELL
Spazturtle: Gah! I didnt read the script! It was a coincidence! Honest, it was my fist time watching this movie
Deadlypon3: Yh but he could change it for the better
IRONY"
Deadlypon3: misping?
So in the beginning we see that the whole family is just full of shit , and suddenly whole touchyfeely bs is real ?
i'd totally go on a murder spree every tiem if this happened :I
WHY DOES LIFE HAS TO BE SO IRONIC!
Deadlypon3 XD i agree fuck her
there used to be some kind of inside joke here relating to me and Pikachu
emotionless
tell it.
...
/me licks otakon17 and Bjornfot and MadScientIsht
I don't remember what it was though
Twilight_Sprinkle I dunno
these characters are terrible. the only one with development is the main one
hes going to take his 5 million and get loads of bitches
lol applebloom quote
Maybe there is a bleed effect for sentimentality
i go on a raping spree
OH COME ON!
the others just suddenly radically change personality as the plot demands
OH GOD HE HAS TO LIVE IT AGAIN
Goddammit
/me touches Bronysith
face...palm?
Again!?
Alright. That part is rustling my mom's jimmies.
COME ON! Another repeat!
WHY THE FUCK IS IT NOT OVER
take the knife
Fucking really!?!!?
aim for the chast
Really? This is just dickish now.
?????????????????
twilight_sprinkle: you're back :3
ok, time for the last loop I guess?
I honostly thought that was the end
da fuq
00,10now it's the me time part of the loops
load
kill yoself
....
A moral about letting go of things and letting people lvie there life? FUCK THAT SHIT!
damnit all to hell
Reallylikehermane: Well I hope the main character develops its the point of this type of story
what
BREAK IT DOWN
dafuq
ah, now we're in the mastering skills
my gosh there is no escape at all :(
Now we dance!
it's dragging out so long it's painful...
....
He is learning to break dance
He is learning new skills
the time-warp dance
dancing?
um okay
did the day repeat still?
why
Ooooooooookay
many loops actually, he's taking time to learn something.... not the lesson though
/me noms on twilight_sprinkle :3
00,10it's like where jack and t'elc learned to juggle
why
OperatorPony: Eeyup
why is this happening?
Troll day repeats itself no matter how many lessons learnt
He's gone crazy
/me licks Bronysith and MadScientIsht and otakon17
...Why did he need to do this on the dirt?
Bill Murray did it better when he learned to play the piano.
WHY IS THIS MOVIE NOT OVER
Ooh yeah, deliberately use the time to get perfect at everything.
filler time
so if he kills himself it will still restart
thelonecubone: yeah, been playing tf2 :P *nomz :3*
Why didn't it end with the last loop that would have worked instead of this BS
spending the loop learning to dance. smart move indeed
Okay, so the movie realized that its runtime was too short and now we're padding this already-kinda-weak concept?
what in celestia's name is going on?!
Awesome
did anyone read the fanfic of this with the Gala and blueblood?
Remember Kevin?
I think this is multible days
he's got some mad skills
is this the..... end?
It's as if that's not the best place to do that.
right here
He is a Choreaograph
BEST PART OF THE MOVIE
twilight_sprinkle: I do need to get a good pc for that ;3;
Cosmo You could literally learn anything with the loop thing when given enough time!
"is the day over yet?" "no you killed maybe 20mins
its NYAN CAT LOGIC
See, I'd use this loop to see the whole of the internet in a single day.
And he learns...breakdancing
...how long has this movie been? it feels like it's been dragging on for like 3 hours
Ded
0,14why is he dancing?
no, Reallylikehermane. iT any good?
00,10the movie cant end till he dose all the things you normaly do on a time loop
:S
/me brings down the morale of chat altogether
his skils are so amazing he will break the space-time fabric and become free
that's a good question; when the day loops, does he keep the skills he learns?
ah finally a good use for a timeloop , become good at everything and be a god among men if you everget out of it
There's an MLP fan fic with this?
i saw the hobbit today
oh no, I hope they dont end the movie like this
I kinda wanna read it now.
Is he going to win with the power of break-dancing?
Does muscle memory carry over from loop to loop?
it was amazing
ITS NYAN CAT LOGIC
I never named any of my pokemon
Well, it's groundhog day but with ponies. Prince Bluebood has the Gala loop over and over.
Again
crud, with the loops, he can afford the time to learn ANYTHING! twilight would love that
-break dance with jeans-
HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE?
thelonecubone: my computer lags in tf2 too >.<
emotionless...
What's the name?
Todd
Cirno: She would
Its like Bill murry Learning piano!
I have all the time in the world. Should I use it to find a cure for cancer? Nah. I'll just learn to break dance.
twilight_sprinkle: lel, I hope you get a good pc as well :)
Ta_Dikin: only it's not cool :(
Pony_6381 I dunno :p
00,10stargate did best groundhog loop
WHAT IS GOING ON
Dashes CriticKitten Yeah the cartoon special of this story only lasted 30 minutes
SaxyPretender, he's learning how to dance because he has all the free time he can ever want in the time loop.
Eeyup
Sumica: YUP
thelonecubone: that probably wont happen
Can this juse end
Sumica: YES
yeah
its called the best night ever. (Same as the episode.)
Deadlypon3: There is one where everyday the world ends in a diferent way
Stop licking me dammit
Dashes: This one's 90 min
twilight_sprinkle: why ;3;
No
0,14ah
Dad: I love you. Kid: Me too. SCUMBAG KID
I love this concept.
I wish to be called Everto from her onwards
Spazturtle ...Doesn't sound THAT bad
otakon17: stop tasting like french fries and chocolate
Of repeating days.
J_E_Smith71: seriously? it feels like it's been at least 2 hours >_<
@Sumica I agree
Sumica: We should watch that
...OH MY GOD
Skeptical Jill
Oh Gods this movie is about an hour too long
...
be back later
That's a strange mix, innit?
Sumica: you mean where Oneal and Tealc learn science
otakon17: seiously.
Dashes: That's because they're padding the SHIT out of this movie
I dislike numbers at the end of my name
"Your father is a dickless idiot."
00,10yes that one.
Nothing is strange with chocolate
CriticKitten: eeyup.
commercials are better than this
"I mean, sure, he is trying the best he can, BUT FUCK HIM!"
I have a bad feeling on what hes planning
Deadlypon3 XD I LOVE
Eh, fair enough.
00,10pea diddy
U
watch the day it doesnt loop he didnt get the lottery ticket
breakdancing
Neopets!
Yeah this is what happens when you make a movie out of a short story you pad the hell out of it and drag it out
thelonecubone: well my computer is sufficient for studies,and my father isnt thrilled about geting a new computer
u no it high quality when there are voices but their mouths arent moving
Sumica: I loved that one.
okay
Pea Diddy.
Pea Diddy
And why the heck has my name not changed?
DEM MOVES

Pea diddy XD

twilight_sprinkle: ah, i see
SaxyPretender: Ye Gods

HELL YEA
Cool
wow
pea diddy lol
it is
pea diddy what the hell
HAHA nice way to hide the stunt double
Ah
So THIS is what the dance practice was for!
ok, so you can dance. But dancing in a suit like that surely requires more skill
Must be hard to breakdance in a pea suit.
SaxyPretender Its funny cause...he's wearing a dumb costume.
I like the belch song better
:DBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOO:D
Shit nigga
um THIS IS ALMOST AS BAD AS BIRDEMIC
lol, i spent a whole month of living the same day to learn this!
it has changed Everto
Nao Dub Step!!!!1
u no it high quality when there are voices but their mouths arent moving
thelonecubone: i dont plan on playing games much anyway
That is one of the strangest things I have ever said.
The Green Pea Hornet
...fuck this movie
PEA DIDDY
GET IT
I wonder if this can competes to "Pig Power In The House"...
you know they couldve stopped the movie after that last night but why is it still going>
oni_link nothing is as bad as birdemic
BadAss
fuck this music
lol
SaxyPretender and an old dude wearing a funny suit...and they are
hm
twilight_sprinkle: so get a console? :P
still better than Insane clown posse
He could make a musical masterpiece, nope breakdance

Padding, padding, paaaaaadding~
log on
Or at least today.
10/10 best movie ever

Orion: sadly true
So godd

make dancing not fighting. ^_^
So He is forced to go back to the moment where he pushed the doorbell?
even the arnald Swarz movie is better
Gaige: this is pretty close acting wise. but birdemic is on a whole nother lever because of the CGI
Sinestro: No kidding
So is it FINALLY final goddamn day?
AJfan77: hey to each his own...
thelonecubone: eh those are expensive too,and stil dont plan on playing games much, only a few im interested in
Bull
JESUS
Deadlypon3: Yeah like 1,000 times
Now the moment's everyone's been waiting for...the end of this movie!
Haha troll
:O
JESUS WINS
oni_link you got that right
ah
17 years?
zeus that was a joke
for your retarded costumes and rap music@
Slow clap
Ey Kammerjunk, let me show you MY "strange thing". ;)
Otakon17 ...That's just fucking cruel.
...
whole town is full of jerks
And this is the condition that breaks him out of the time loop.
00,10so realy it was just a fucked up quantim leap
Jesus just lost to peas
oh my
AJfan77: i know lol
YOU SUCK
This is Chrono Trigger if you were forced to play it for eternity
If this doesnt get him out of the loop I dont know what will
0,14That that, Jesus!
BOOOOO
master plan is working
Now the father decides his life is complete.
BBBBBOOOOOOOOO

Never give up. Never surrender!
Dinkelberg...
00,10evil was defeated
YES, JESUS IS EVIL!
Fuck you, Hendersons!
evil jesus
00,10jesus
Evil was DEFEATED
What? GOOD was defeated
so by that logic Jesus is evil
...jerks much
/me carries Bjornfot and Kammerjunk away for PM, "not the place"
Was he calling Jesus evil?
That was a bad link sorry
AlienWarhead: Lel
Take that jesus
fuck you dinkerberg
Jesus confirmed for EVIL
yodd
My name is Everto
what evil
/me throws a pea at Bronysith.
Shoo!
and you shall all bow down
CriticKitten: XD
Jesus is evil, it's canon.
Not to me, per se. But rather to a person I choose
00,10spare time
god this acting
When does he realize that his entire family is evil, and he is leaving his son to a horrible fate of being raised by them?
literally
Poor evil jesus
I think the movie should have ended a long time ago
So now you have to tell us
And I choose Santa Claus
what does your name mean?
yup
^
thbbvg
this should have ended ilke 30 mins ago
i cant agree more
You must bow down to Santa Claus
Kammerjunk: Jesus was actually a pretty cool guy, but people are misinterpreting his words in evil ways, so you COULD say he is evil by proxy, but...
Darf14: Which makes its short runtime all the more hilarious!
00,10lets go to the pub
Winston churchill also said that he would walk this movie to the gates of hell and shake its hand
actually make that an hour
Has a heart attack
DinkelBUUUUUURRG
The acting is bad, but the writing is FUCKING GENIUS!
woosh
First rendition of the groundhog day plot that leaves the audience feeling trapped and wishing it was over too
I'm really sorry about that last link I didn't read the website title
Sumica: Pub?
Is there a sequel
Sumica And then we can get some british tarts and crumpets@
Umm
Take the kid to the pub!
fucking END movie
Cue the jump-cut to the next time loop.
lol
a kid to the pub?
I HATE THAT KIDS HEAD!!!
Dashes: It should have ended 60 mins ago
I dunno what it means.
Reallylikehermane: sadly
who voted for this?
To the Pub. They have mead there and it comes in pints.
...HE HAS TO DO IT AGAIN!?
J_E_Smith71: yeah :C
Dat oven
Am I the only one enjoying this movie?
It's just a name I thought sounded original
Zeus: Gastion
lol
what is this?
Cosmo: you predicted it! Are you in a time loop of this movie?
so to break the curse, he has to bail and not hang with them for half the day
now its dragging the dang plot >_<
And no one else uses it
Kid: I wanna openmy frackin presents
Er Gaston

Bjornfot: Ignoring all possible beliefs are going by the assumption he lived and preached the values written in the Bible, the problem is that like all intelligent people, he was probably not a straight thinker.

Hey Shizuka

Which leads it to be easily misinterpreted by others.

And I can't tell you how many times someone called me Neot
so many times has he relived that day?
gak
DERNIT no g aaaaaaaa k allowed
Everto is worse.
haha
oh its not, huh
00,10I am starting to feel sorry for all of us
Oop
probably a few million times now
But enough on that. I have other sleep-deprived rambling to do.
woah
0,14now I feel bad for todd again
im starting to lose the point of this movie
gak
And what the heck is a tyguy?
Shizuka: How long does it usually take Norton to scan a PC?
00,10this short movie wont end
SweetieG4K: I think we've lost count at this point
Make your name "Weed"
i'd rather watch 90 minutes of G*k than this movie :P
A guy who is ty?
AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR DAT
The heck...
is bak
CriticKitten: but the outcome is playdoh even though it was clearly goop before
Sumica: How long is this movie?
i got time for dat
Sumica: This movie's concept has outlived its run time.
we should rewatch and count
I hope the writer for this movie has bad stomach cramps
fuck Todd
He's just getting nicer and nicer
yeah its been dragging on for too long now
Sumica You know, in the bill murray movie, at least there were a LOT of stuff that was needed to be resolved!
WHY DOESN NOBODY LIKE THIS MOVIE
Such as this coffee.
I lost count, but I think hes on loop No. 538
This is just silly
Oh wait
g*k is mother bucking BACK
OohShiny: At the end of the movie, he just wakes up? And he's Ghandi.

CHILD ABUSE
this is starting to seem like they started to not give any effort after that touching night
ewww
What the heck? I didn't say the word.
Or maybe it could be that people have rewritten all parts of teh bible at least a dozen times thourgh the ages and also mistranslated etc etc

Neo - Neopets. Ty - Tyler. Guy - I guess it sounded cool with 'Ty'
He still hasn't learned much...
This mocha is perfect mix of chocolate and coffee, along with milk and just a dash of sugar.
HOW MUCH LONGER
lol
otakon17: I use norton before, It depends on how much files you have in your computer and cpu usage
so what happened to todd being a nice guy? He's back to being an asshole now...

I DONT BELEIVE IN SANTA CUZ I STAYED UP WATCHING FOR SANTA AND MY MUM PUT OUT GIFTS THAT SAID FROM SANTA FAIL.
I have no idea where the 40 came from though

Mcintosh speaks other than eyup
OPEN THE CASE
what about the rainbow apples
FYI Flim Flam means scam
THEY ARE CHANGLINGS
I thought when you were cleaning up your keyboard you were reacting in shock to Meth's suggestion
GASP
anyways, flim flam just means ripping off
That's what I thought.
Lol
and or scam
standing
Squallken: Zap apples?
Goddesses bless the free markey, eh?
Changelings are an entire race of alicorns :I
I was just joking everyone.
Interesting to watch and think about the risk of them losing the farm now that we KNOW the parents are dead. :(
nuffer
yes the zap apple
no one has anything better to do...
CIDER SEASON = BLACK FRIDAY
they could just ... oh I dont know ... NOT let the flim flam brothers have the apples to make cider
that's a big line
buffer*
oh shit, zap apple cider, just think about it
00,10is't AB a bit young to be serving booze?
Bronysith: It' a good thing nopony in Equestria owns a dictionary.
Flim and Flam can be dicks, but I see where they're coming from. Being travelling cider makers must be tough, as they never have an apple orchard of their own.
Squallken: I want
nope
no
Shes 21ish.
nope
IS there any Zap Apple cider?
isn't flim and flam the stuff that gets stuck in your throat when youre sick
Poor RD!

Sumica: she's not drinking it, though~
oni_link: that sounds delicious
even twilight got in line earlier than rd
rainbow dash even farther back in line
they are the sole provider, how can they go out of business
Sucks to be RD
free filly labor
spike has a cup too
Just don't let them use your apples!
Spike is just a kid, why is he drinking cider?
NOT AGAIN
Jazmyn: Nah that's flem
well, execpt for Rarity, who owns Sweetie Belle.

Donkey: not that I can think of
why doesnt RD just stay in line overnight?
spike can go fuck himself
Oh For Pete Sake!!!!!!
BITCHES
poor granny
flim flam means a scam or ripoff
OohShiny: I know o.o I want some
MEH
IF that line is as long as it looks, than Ponyville sure is far from Sweet Apple Acres6_9
I love the VA for Flim Flam
It's* except*
Sumica: Yes. Yes she is. [Phineas and Ferb refference approaching]

But, he just said Shut up.

Obviously, Flim and Flam are changlings

snorting apple fumes
Faithful Farmer!
But it was Granny Smith who agreed on it in the end.

00,10jab jab jab, gogogo
dawww applebloom riding the bag
applebloom wut r u doin

No
The way this episode goes by is very similar to the episode of Spongebob where Neptune and Spongebob have a burger-making competition.
...everytime I see this now I see Faithful Farmer
True.
I'm not doing this
what is A/S/L?
Is it considered uncouth to not wear horseshoes in Equestria?
crap
Nothing
I really like AJ in this episode
@brony655321, YES!!
Even the ending is nearly identical.

Come to think of it, Sweet Apple Acres is a monopoly.
Time Turner but everyone refers to him as Doctor Whooves, myself included
timey wimey stuffs
@Dashes I like it.
fail
00,10Time turnner is just his cover name
http://ponybot.net/?i=2142
Docter Whooves?
Applejack: Aw, buck.
1:6 ratio
dat engineering
Yeah official name is Hooves
people still do A/S/L?
Kandarihu: still, they dont have a choice since apparently they need the money or they get run out of the business
Time Turner is the "John Smith" of Equestria :D
Isn't his name Dr. Hooves?
Doctor Hooves
This reminded me of something...We never seen Cider Attack gameplay for a long time now!
constantly
dr whooves
thought that died back before the myspace era
she's overdosing
How do you do A/S/L?
Yeah his name is Hooves
it's just his "John Smith" name :P
Well at least the creators care about their fanbase unlike many shows today:)
just say asl
robots are superior!
Flim and Flam are 6 times as fast
eh
Time to cheat!
RARITY IS BEST PONY!!!
Ya know you actually have to age cider or all you have is applejuice
this show is so inconsistent it hurts
How is this supposed to be alcohol. This is clearly Apple Juice ! FAKE !
I never understood why they didin't just refuse to sell apples to the flimflams?
I really hate how you guess make up reason to protect your precious fanon facts
Anyone?
00,10it's not cheating if they dont care.
Think for a sec, if they said no right here, things would have turned out quite differently
SlyTag: funny way to spell "Rainbow Dash"
oh
ASL!
Raritydiamond: Even more amazing since they're even supporting fans outside the demograph
LOL
ASL!1
<_< They're totally family members. >_>
so what were the lottery things?
Objection? nah
Those words will be there downfall

hi
APPLE HEADS

in my sleep
SouthernSweet: Hasbro and Doctor Whooves story?
I beat you in Pokemon, Rival
WOAH
At the rate they were producing and such, they might even have won if they just remained at normal speed and didnt ruin it by turning off quality control
FlutterTree!!!!!!
RD presses Big Mac in her sleep
40,m,texas?
DO U EVEN PRESS
twilight_sprinkle, they can't survive as a company under the terms that the Flim Flam Brothers insisted on. If they would budge on the cut, then they could form a partnership.
Look at Fluttershy GO!!
Dashes http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5244-come_at_me_darling.jpg
hey, hey twilight
Flutter Tree
nice
40 year old male from texas
why dont you lift all the apples
Fluttershy communicates with her kin, as you can see.
Use the pinkie sense
LOL
Deleted scene, RD was running in her sleep while on the press
with your magic?
horrid horrid
Lovely
lovely
00,10why is dash flaping?
lol there werent any apples when PInkie jumped
horrid
That's the most likely response
Like in Applebuck Season.
my fiance used to always respond "50/M/NYC"
congrats Meth
Fluttershy as a tree is already canon
Kandarihu: possibly, they didnt really say how much of the money they need
15 barrels
Sumica: Typical pegasus
Twilight is SLACKING
gooodah badah
@Dashes, Yeah. Hasbro couldn't get the rights to rename him Dr. Whooves, but they did change it to Dr. Hooves in honor of the fans.
Same reason Scootaloo does?
and everyone would disconnect immediately
Sumica: Maybe she thinks that'll make it go faster?
huzzah
DOUBLE THE POWAH!
awesome! :D
Wow, so many people here, and good morning!
I can picture it now
holy shit
again, show is ridiculously inconsistent
SCOTTY
WELL THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY...

in the end you are simply deluding yourself
Buytoast x fluttershy
Discussion: What is your favorite pony shipping?
I meant asdf
oh I don't really have a shipping I like
I think the best episodes of season 3 were episode 3 and 5
Thats ok
Anyone here play Minecraft?

nope.avi
Discussion: If you were to pick one episode from all the seasons, which one is your favorite?

Discussion: Who is best pony? (your opinion)
http://youtu.be/8_eROi3Idik
dont fight
nopony is best pony
Princess Cadence
chocalate chip pony
Spike is best pony
Twist is clearly the best one.
^
SPIKE
pony_3238: oh so you like Mary Sue OC?
lol
fluttershy for me'
blueblood is best pony
Now to wait for main chat to settle down >.>
11,02DangerDashie: Yay :D
we attack by Dawn
and diamond tiara
Q: Who is best pony. My rection There be a shit storm a brewin
Bronysith: Cadence is so powerful you can literally throw her at any problem.
and silver spoon
none for me
NOPE
DocSane: she is such a shoehorned in character like shining armor it hurts
11,02best pony is derpy :3
Color_Cloud: Yes, all embarrassing. Next.
Lol nope
Fluttershy is best pony
In my opinion, it's Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy
Discussion: Who is best pegasus?
Well, I cannot decide between purple smart, Fluttershy and Derpy
twilight_sprinkle: do you think cadance and shining armor are shoehorned in or just stupid business scheme?
or both?
Fluttershy for me
But in Season 3, my fav is Pinkie
Bronysith: Yes, but remember that this is Hasbro's show, and they wanted a new pinkl princess to sell.
One mustn't just simply pick ONE favorite pony. :c
SuperBrony64 \:3/
Bronysith: business as in for merch selling?
name your favorite side character that you want to see more of... besides luna
twilight_sprinkle: yea
Ironic that Gaben's fav pony is Pinkie Pie, yet Season 3 Episode 3 was Too Many Pinkie Pies.
no midnight stream?
Discussion: What inspired you to becom a brony/pegasister?
Bronysith: Considering the big brother ponies in G1 were introduced in EXACTLY the same shoehorned-in way, I'll just consider it an MLP tradition.
Bronysith: possibly both, maybe just shoe-horned in
wtf?
selinna25 is a spammer :O
Bronysith: "Hey, here's a big brother we've never mentioned before. Let's sing about how awesome they are!"
What inspired me to become a pegasister, is by looking up the fandom
twilight_sprinkle: i mean "i love my big brother so much, thats why i never tell my best friends ever"
lols
http://i44.servimg.com/u/f44/17/14/57/39/haha_n10.jpg

Discussion: Who is your favorite vuillan?
Villan

Okay, I gotta sleep. Work tomorrow. Later.
but it's 10:50
Color_Cloud: kefka
Check out my new equation: MLP:FIM + LPS = MLP G2
bye DocSane
BYE!
I think you need #symbol before room names
bye karonia
fleskywood: its closed when there isnt enough people to require splitting them up, which is now
Bye DocSane

thelonecubone: never
#pinkiepie
gak is best villain
Color_Cloud: i liked his mane? :S lol
people give sombra too much hatred
ikr
Oh, they're handing out paddlin's again?
anyways
ShinitaiHana: that one gets me into #Spike
all the villains suck compared to the joker or kefka
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4rWNhFI7Wc
but gak...
Excuse me, does the stream start at 12am East?
i like king sombra especially on tumblr
all the villains suck compared to the joker or kefka
Discussion: Have you had nightmears with ponies?
What is the maximum size for sigs?
I think bronystate did a good job at keeping g situation under control
I tried v.v
it is a chat that i happen to like anyway
with coffee talk as his sidekick
Color_Cloud: yes, unfortunately I have
Woot! Changed my MC skin! :3
ShinitaiHana: how u do that O.o
i only have good dreams with ponies
the return of Gak will be the villan Smooz from G1
particularly luna
i hink the stream is dead
700x250 i think
Smooze is G AK
which with that recent episode of luna dream walking kind of started to make me think...
ogod i am so sorry luna
I typed it exactly as it looks
or maybe 150
the great smooooze
Color_Cloud: Nope!
Is somepony gonna pick up the stream, ir it totally ded for the night?
cool :3
Anyone seen that youtube video with scootaloo and slender mane?
ShinitaiHana: but it sends to a different channel, how u do that?
there is no technical maximum size limit
luna invaded my dreams and did things
like have tea
oops, forgot your not supposed to say that word
only a character limit
and cookies
but don't make it too huge
Oh
Okay.
Luna and Celestia appeared in my dream once, fighting lol
i baked you a pie, oh boy what flavor, pie flavor
I dont know! I think discord is here
I hope we get a good shot of derpy tomorrow.
theres a physical size limit, it will make the sig scroll if its too big.
Here: http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-1060-read-signatures.html
Color_Cloud: they werent fighting in my dreams...they were very kind
Doubt that derpy will appear in tommorows episode
omg who cares about derpy
I know, but one can hope.
hmmm... #spike
oright
everyone...
T~T
lol
nope still spike lol
pinkie is best pony
I lik e fluttershy.
ShinitaiHana: odd
fluttershy os best tree
Naw, Diamond Horse is best horse
:.
:>*
Fluttershy is a tree, Spike is Rainbowdash, Scootaloo is chicken, what is pinkie pie?
('-(\
god this fandom =_=
a spy!
Hey!
pinkie pie is best forth wall breaker
Is anybody still down to watch some ponies?
plp855: false on so many levels
yup
plp855: animaniacs are best 4th wall breakers
whay y
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljSwzCI7zb0dammit, a friend of mine sent me this video. goodbye sleep.
I'm not sure if it's against rules to post links to outside streams.
I was going to stream some post-movie-night-ponies if anybody wanted to get in on it.
Wow, stuffs happening in the Spike room
... ponies
the end
the animaniacs control the fifth wall.
MLP is not the best written animated tv show of all time, it is great animation with decent writings, but Animaniacs and Batman the Animated series are the best animated series ever
No Wall-E? :<
l
well written, well animated and consistent
lovely
That was hours ago
Bronysith: I'm pretty partial to Avatar The Last Airbender.
meh not a fan of animaniacs myself
twilight_sprinkle: i get that
Darn, I knew I would get the times mixed up.
Ah well.
Bronysith: Have you seen Gravity Falls yet?
twilight_sprinkle: i just find it fun
http://www.spyroforum.com/post-384525.html#384525
goodnight guys see ya tommorow for episode
and avatar had one of the worst and most cliche endings ever
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDtdQ8bTvRc
i like curoge the cowerdly dog
Dauven: it looks fun, but animaniacs and batman TAS is much better
*are
twilight_sprinkle: I didn't think it was a bad ending.

Also, korra gets way too much love, all because it is steampunk
twilight_sprinkle: which one, Korra or Last?
that square spam
never seen kora
Dauven: i thought it was terrible because he pretty much just went avatar mode and beat the crap out of the big bad last boss, no need for 3 seasons of "important" lessons before it
Bronysith: Korra has nicer show feel and animation.
thelonecubone: Lasr
Dauven: sucks
noone sees zalgo text?
twilight_sprinkle: ah
korra sucks
so much
i do
Korra's pretty decent.

Bronysith: Last Airbender trashes it in terms of plot.
plp855: kill yourself
fleskywood: we see it, but im not sure if its allowed
no
Dauven: which is the most important part
But you can't deny the better quality animation.
is iy?
I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece but I enjoyed it. Original much better though.
is it*
plp855: that is a terrible fucking meme that gives a good game a terrible name
JOIN THE CAMPAIGN!
Or the tone and feeling the show carries throughout its episodes.
lol seriously dude?
Its weak points are its plots and characters.
yup
And yeah, the animation is gorgeous.
You know I'm just going to have to move that to spam, right?
And ultimately its believability is compromised along the way.
i took an arrow to the knee
8,05good evening, #bronystate
i wouldnt say the last airbender had such a great story
Yeah.
Hi Technicality
Good evening, Technicality!
But postphone the move

H1llo!

The Last Airbender was great because of the character development.
twilight_sprinkle: still better than korra, and Zuko is probably my fav tragic character
Hello^
The story was pretty straightforward.
Technicality, hello and get rid of the color
Bronysith: ive not seen that much of korra, i wouldnt know, altho from the bits i saw the story seemed more or less fine
What code do I put for an Image on my sig?
texasboykc09: not a thing could ever make me do so ^_^
Man I really wanna' watch ponies with some folks!
Dauven: now i want to see Last airbender again ;-;

You also did the first tag wrong, it's [img] not [img/]
Bronysith: yeah he was a nice character, so was his uncle
Oh :o
twilight_sprinkle: one of my characters in my book is inspired by him
That's cause at 1st i put img, /img, but it didnt work

No, Applecrisp, you are not.
/me throws bread at Applecrisp "Everyone needs sleep"
lol are you gonna go?
I dont know if I should go or not though, I might be too weirded out.
Unless you're Sumica
Applecrisp Try not sleeping for many hours straight and all. You'll end up dying
Then you don't need sleep.
all you can eat... ya, I passed out with a food coma
He's right
speaking from experience
Nope, Sumi sleeps.
conventions are pretty weird
I'm just now noticing TheOtakuAscended channel disapeared
yeah'

post ponies
I've never been to a brony convention
make them jelous XD
Dusky Porbably or just lurking really well
I dont think im at the point where I can tolerate such weirdness.
probably*
killerpony7733: to lurk well you just dont say shit
But I'm sure it would be much worse than some of the creepy stuff I've seen at mine
Dusktattt
wtf?
^^
one time i didt sleep for 2 days and was the only one awake in PE :$
You deleted the thread?!?!?!?
Bronysith Exactly?
Imma call 911
No
I moved it to SPAM
I bet the NY one is the strangest.
where it belongs
what movie did they play?
I missed it
I think the canadian one would be pretty mild....
Have some music everyone http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtQuxyByUMk

/me throws dosh at DashWithRainbows
:L
I'll be keeping my eyes on you, Sumica
I went to this http://daishocon.com/ two years in a row
Silly Adam, I'll get proof of Sumica wanting sleep at some point.
Just you watch.
o.o
im pretty sure Sumica just recharges
you may notice their mascot is some kind of furry
like a fuckign phones
00,10why do you think I troll before new eps
But it is not a furry convention, I swear
Pffft
00,10I am powered by rage and tears
Of course it was.
Sumica, do it
You fuel-
I came back from watching "The Hobbit"
You went to a furry convention.
Do eeeeeeeettt
Damn it.
admit it.
i am not the fuel, you ah!
what did you wear, your fursuit?
Wasn't a bad movie.
*ze fuel
are yall furrys?
Sumica: hence evangelion?
Okay okay
STORMAGEDDON IS A FURRY
no.
00,10that movie riped off lord of the rings
I wore my wolf fursuit
8,05Sumica: we all troll before new eps <3
It's a new one
00,10they did't even try and hide it
because wolves are my spirit animal
duh
Sumi power plants. Connected straight to all your butt hurt on the interwebz.
It was based off Lord Of The Rings
Hmm
yiff yiff
okay no
lol
Even the "My Precious" guy was there
I think my spirit animal is a weasel
yiff
That would be cool
>.>
I'm not doing this joke anymore
berberborscing: thatsthejoke
XD
No
Serious berberborscing.
A penguin
hahaha
Seriously*
I hate trolls.
show up at a furry convention as a snake.
I think there's a name for that actually
A snake
trolls are awesome though
"Scalies"
i kill trolls fairly easily, though it takes all of my mana to do so
:)
HOW ABOUT AN ARMADILLO
even the weirdest thing I can think of is normal at a furry convention.
lolololololololololololololol
twilight_sprinkle: which spell do u to kill them?
Oh does anyone remember that "scalie" person that used to always come here?
Hi everybody
And the fatass orc couldn't possible be better than the pale white one
Hi The_Engineer
Hello The_Engineer
No, I know my spirit animal
It is Bill Cosby
Hell
00,10but no I wont be able to troll tonight
o
thelonecubone: fireball i think
you use*
hello*
Sumica, that's a pity
00,10work in an hour
in like 2010 I think
Omegle is blocked in my country
I'
hoi The_Engineer
LOL bill cosby
thats good
CosbyCon
Sumica, because of work?
m gonna upload a link to a videogame I love, called .hack?
bronies are also incredibly easy to troll, just say 2 words and then you get 30 pages of ass damaged text
Yea
00,10I wont even get to watch the ep with you all
I'm going to CosbyCon
hiyas
It's only for us Cosbies
aww
Wait
Sumica, who going to stream it?
don't worry Sumica
00,10I am streaming it
You stream the new episode Sumica
lol
we'll let you know how it ends as soon as you get back
00,10remote acces is magic
that would actually be pretty awesome
Dusky: so thoughtful!
http://www.homemademech.com/Uploads/Greview/9651114733575.jpg
Anyone know dustforce?
make a big deal out of some retarded convention idea like cosbycon
twilight_sprinkle: aren't I just?
and everyone shows up with bill cosby masks
00,10i am kinda hopeing it's leaked today =p
That's the Cubia boss in that image
<insert innocet face here>
berberborscing: what?
00,10So i can watch it on my lunch break
get press attention.
This will be my first Bronystate experiance
Dusky: absolutely, i gotta take thoughtfulness lessons from you :D
berberborscing: thats like, too bad
http://www.crydev.net/viewtopic.php?f=126&t=103758
It's a PS2 game
oops, wrong IRC
twilight_sprinkle: it's really easy
But it's really epic
berberborscing: its just a bad picture
just ask yourself what would discord do
You are really serious about this
huh
Oh, need a picture of the videogame box or something?
This is for a different forum site.
berberborscing: no, i know about that game
Dusky: but he would do anything
aw, your avatar is cute on that forum
I am a professional troll ;)
berberborscing: its just a bad pic
and everything
If you're not going to be here, who's gonna stream it Sumica?
Thanks.
It is my pet
Red Panda.
I think meth = furry.
A lot of stuff going on, makes quality a hard goal to reach
Me? I might become one
totally
twilight_sprinkle: he would not
that would explain everything
Even my game lagged during that battle
Bronies are like, one step above furries.
but just by a little bit.
That bastard kept switching between Physical Tol and Magic Tol
Lol
I think they're a step below
Dusky: he would do something unexpected, but if you could guess what it would be then it wouldnt be unexpected enough for him
with great power comes inherent laziness, let that be your guiding light, twilight_sprinkle
lol
I'll probably get kicked for this
But if you like ponies, great
/me suplexes twilight_sprinkle with lagann
yay~
Dusky, words of wisdom
If you shout to the world you like ponies, that's a cry for attention
Furries don't cry for attention
They yiff for it
/me explodes
PONIES
AdamTheDuck: words I live my life by
How loud do I need to say it?
:p
Well
twilight_sprinkle: so how is R3?
/me noms on twilight_sprinkle's remains >:3
First off we can't hear you
.hack was a great game I played all the time until NFSMW 2012 came out
yiff yiff yiff
In decibels
yay:[
U,,
Umm*
150
Ive got a meter here to measure it.
over 9000
I tried Pumpkin Pie. Loved it. Key lime pie didn't taste very good to me
Bronysith: only OVA1 is up on youtube, whatever OVA means. it was ok, doesnt have the same flare as r1 or r2,but maybe thats a good thing
188
The sound of a Blue Whale
twilight_sprinkle: Official, Video, Adaptation
lol
I love the idea of the Spike room.
Anyone Remeber GAK?
what is this blasphemy
GAK?
Got to go for the night, espectially to wake up early for the new episode.
blue whale is not pony.
Why not
Did someone say what isn't back yet?
people got kicked
Should I upload another boss image, or a boss fight video?
this guy pulled into my lot today with the words "pony expressions" on the side of his van
in large letters
Bronysith: hm i dont get adaptation to what in this case
I wanted to go decal his car up before he got pack with random pony faces.,
lol
texasboykc09: you should've been here the first days of gak, It was beatiful. All the kicks :D
Skeith was a pain in the ass honestly, but my bro said I made it look easy
twilight_sprinkle: remind me to punch any brony at any convention ever, who is carrying around that crap =_=
I wonder why we can't just watch MLP episodes.
twilight_sprinkle: the stupid toy
Spammed the hell out of all my health potions
Welcome back thelonecubone :P
thelonecubone, i should of
Health Drinks*
I did forgot that the script was on ;-;
Cuz potions were hard to come by until vol. 2
Bronysith: you mean gак?
whos PonyChat ?
twilight_sprinkle: if i see any brony, carrying around that stupid goo, i am going to smack them, seriously, forced meme is so incredibly forced
twilight_sprinkle: were tehy not pleased with the premiere that they had to make a stupid meme?
Bronies= one of the worst fandoms ever
like every fandom out there
Bronysith: eh it was just something to latch on to to kill time during the ads, and 4 straights ads of it sealed the deal
Ever fandom is terrible.
:>
Every*
Bronies just think they're special because everyone keeps talking about them.
So is the ninjazz fandom.
Ninjazz: yea, but bronies are one of the worse ones
berberborscing, D:
Ninjazz fandom is best fandom D:
I want to go to Ninjazzcon
Aw hell naw.
for example doctor who fans think that that show is the first to come up with time travel stuff and dont know their classics, not even bttf
but i love the Ninjazz fandom ;3;
Where I can buy a Ninjazzplushie
Fandom in a forum of brony fandom?
Fandomception
Forum? o.o
There will be no jazz voice actors, Adam, thelonecubone.
i knew this spray was coming sooner or later
I forbid it. :I
D:
twilight_sprinkle: or that the whovians havent even seen classic doctor who
okay
Ninjazz, D:
;~;
Did someone say something that ended with -ception?
twilight_sprinkle: to be fair, the only shows or movies that got it right was doctor who, terminator and back to the future
Nope...
Bronysith: i hope its better, because i wasnt impressed at all by the stuff i saw, which was from tennant season
/me attacks AttackWithHugs with hugs ;~;
Fine, I'll go to the AttackWithHugs fandom
At least I can go to the AttackWithHugscon
Bronysith, hey, as long as you enjoy calling yourself a brony and don't a shit whether or not you call yourself one, I don't care. But as far as group mentality goes, all fandoms suck. :/
By sleeping
twilight_sprinkle: i think people just like tennant cause hes sexy...so fucking ... sexy
and buy a AttackWithHugsplushie there ;~;
and its supposed to be at 10:30
twilight_sprinkle: cause tennant is a great actor
Whoaaaaaa.....when did I become a fandom and a convention?
AdamTheDuck: can i come too? ;3;
ILL BE SLEEPING PAST TJAT TO,E
i dont sleep:|
gnite everybody
Plushes are fine, though.
that time*
Holy sheit.
Bronysith: well there is no right or wrong in this stuff, its all fantasy, "wibbly wobbley timey wimey stuff" isnt a proper theory
Who the hell needs eyelids anymore
if i sleep i will miss the stream
http://inception.davepedu.com/
night
Night
ill fucking pass out just right at the start of the episode
lol
http://i.imgur.com/KGK5e.gif wut?
twilight_sprinkle: thats why i like terminators, once you go back, thats it, you are stuck
Rarity Jensen? I sure as hell asked for this.
Why don't I join AdamTheDuck fandom? Free stabs from a rusty kitchen knife for the first 20 people!
play games 'til 10:30!
mmmm, rarity is indeed a beautiful attractive pony
Bronysith: i believe in the parallel timeline one
this is my first stream ill do anything to not miss it:O
twilight_sprinkle: like BTTF?
AttackWithHugs, but they're plush rusty kitchen knives ;~;
god i love back to the future T~T
AttackWithHugs: I want in :O
Torchlight 2 before the ep
AttackWithHugs, you sure? There's a LOT of licking involved with that fandom.
I wanna play BeGone with someone.
Ninjazz: And stabbing.
Even better.
I just got sturday mornings off from work! woohoo!:P
AdamTheDuck: still best fandom thou :P
Licking and stabbing, what a combo!
/me licks Ninjazz :P
well im off
/me lifts AttackWithHugs
Bye Bronysith :)
good day
Goodnight Bronysith :P
Bronysith: yeah, it seems like a theory that could work, although i was thinking more that once you go back, you can never return to your own timeline, only a similar one if you try to make, because if youve gone back, your existance has already changed the future, so you would already be in a dif timeline no matter what
lol, sounds like pinkamena's request on tumblr
/me blasts off with AttackWithHugs in megas
2:00AM start
The Spike room is awesome. Nuff said
Lick them in the face, stab them in the back. Seems like a package deal.
Now where's my stab?
it's already 11:30 ._.
twilight_sprinkle: indeed
I didn't even notice it was this late until now
who plays portal 2
/me passes Ninjazz a plush kitchen knife :>

Silver Mods are really against it.

Now I can
I have a link to the song, but I'm not allowed to upload it at this time
:O
WHOEVER I SSTREAMING THIS CAN YOU PUT SOMETHING ELSE ON AFTER INTERMISSIOON?
Time to play FT:L
Wrek - are we only listening to this because S&G are in the Fallout 4 trailer, or did you have this anyways?
Why did the nurse cross the road?
#Spike is absolute chaos, lol
Wrek, where did you get the background image from
I dunno, dammit why are you asking me?
lol
good song.
well you have all the answers.
To get to the dead kid in the middle, duh. :|
05MirrorImage: it was in my megasmoothalist anyways
:D
Being a hater, now that's illegal
MirrorImage: are you ytpmver?
no
why?
MirrorImage: cause there's a famous ytpmver caller mirrorimage lol
called*
yeah, i seem to be stumbling upon that issue as of recently
OMG
Okay, I just receive a message with the leviosah audio :O
ITS SLENDER MANE
:D*
I've just had a recent facination with skyrim, but every time I try to talk about it, the conversation takes off without me. *sigh*
skyrim is starting to lose its interest at this point
it's no longer "the" big new thing
yeah
agreed
Black Ops 2 and Halo 4 are new things now
skyrim burned out a while back, really...
arrow to the knee joke become even old in like 3 months
de, beatles
dem*
It's still an awesome game, its just not frontline news
arrow to the knee got old in a couple weeks...
still better than copy paste 2
i mean
black ops 2
berberborscing: I dont give a sheet, I love old games :I
the only thing that has EVER gotten old faster than arrow to the knee was gak
I do too
I love .hack series
and thats like 10 years old
...
never played it
anyone get farcry 3?
:/
jijonbreaker: that was old b4 it started
gak jokes lived like 1 day
and i tried to stop it ;3;
life goes on
I was told mayflies live for 8 minutes. :(
far cry 3 i think is good
Everyone Tried to stop it...
Currently I have full exquisite dwarven armor with a warhammer to match.
Far cry a nice game
I don;t get it
A review for it said "Skyrim with guns!"
lvl 15
I mean farcry 1 was aboutn a trpical island full of alter genteic monsters
I almost typed Shyrim...
05i dislike skyrim
05i love fallout though
why?
farcry 2 is in africa with not much plot
Wrek: reasoning?
Skyrim withguns huh? *thinks* isnt that called fallout?
Why dont you liek skyrim?
Hello
05casue in fallout it in most cases doesnt matter what armor you wear.
some one here send their mail to get the dead space 3 early acces to demo on xbox live?
05i can walk around in rags and still survive
I don't dislike skyrim, it's just not really my thing.
05in skyrim im toast
remeber the farcry Instince arc?
You know how all the losers at school say they got swag?
Well Skyrim is demanding more of a GPU than my laptop has.
Well that just means Skyrims more chalenging
05i should go to bed so i wake up in time for episode
thats why I have a bad ass glass armor set in skyrim. so I can still move around but have a chance to survive a shot
05Sunburn: on the contrary
wher the main character of Farcry 1 was mutated into an animal like super soldiers?
Wrek: I happen to like that aspect about it, if armor is all aesthetic, whats the point?
50 years ago, Swag meant "Secretly We Are Gay"
And that's why it's off my wishlist... Dark Souls, too.
herro everyone
I live
berberborscing: and at that same time, gay still ment happy.
05DoctoDoctorWho: because if im skilled enough in fallout to survive with an armor that doesnt have a high DT, killing foes by out witting them
i mean it was awesomto beable to stalk your emeny and claw thier face off with your bare hands in Farcry Instinct
05im not restricted
05and the armor becomes and asthetic
05its wanted
Swag was originally a saying used from 1950 to 1980 to portray gay people who needed to be in the closet because﻿ of the society they lived in...today the saying has been severely skewered by modern society. from secret homosexual lingo, to completely retarded ghetto talk. -DJanthro
HAY GUYS
05but not *required*
You main an assassin type char usually, Wrek?
those guys are hilarious
Well everyone had there opinions so i wont juge
why are people talking about swag and gay?
05if im a killing character
You gonna finish the DLC Wrek?
05otherwise i tend to lean towards a high speech/medicine/science char
05using a small pistol and some melee weapon
05usually relyign on a companion to kill the deathclaws
Oh. More of charasma guy then.
Charisma*
Favorite weapon in Black Ops 1 not black ops 2 :( Double Desert Eagles
that awkward moment where only wrek talks
umm Desrt egal is not in any black ops
Well I guess it all boils down to opinion and playstyle, so the arguement's void. I personally like heavy armor and getting up close and kicking ass in meelee, Im guessing your a stealth/long range character Wrek?
When Wrek speaks, people shut up
:D
lol
agreed
My friend has it, not me, so it may be MW2 to MW3
eww
tthats the series
05Behave and you ahve nothign to fear from me.
that has the Degal
05except my blatant lack of sleep typos
:3
I don't see why everyone keeps shitting their pants when Wrek talks. :/ He's a cool guy. Nothing to fear.
:P
05lets see
/me jimmies are very rustled
05ive scripted so that le lenny is a kick...
05spam is active aswell as gak
because he is a bad ass artest. and historically that also means they are bat shit crazy
05what else is needed for tomorrows shitstorm
00,02Berrypunch is offline again
00,02this is really anoying
Phase4, what does berrypunch do?
the_real_pony_1604, I thought it'd be more because of the fact that he's a bisexual viking but okay.
stuff
00,02texasboykc09, just spamkicks right now
00,02i plan to have it do more later
whats this song?
very nice job
he/she must take it very seriously *end sarcasm*
Wrek, kicks for text walls
le lenny
can we break text walls into paragraphs and not get kicked?
finally a song I know. WOOT!
05the max limit of characters kinda fix that
:/
05Phase4: wish there was a way to ban links
not when i uploaded one link
Wrek does this count as a stream? i really wanna put up a video link
00,02Wrek, that is something i'm looking at
Godsmack
They are really good live, i have seen them twice
once i uploaded a link that took up the entire chat page, then i found out it was a google search result link :$
05berberborscing: yes but its jsut a test really
Wrek, what the limit fir characters
05will go down once igo to sleeps
00,02Wrek, actually what i'm looking at is autokicks based of regular expressions,so i can have it yell at those silly people who paste google image links
:(
aww
05was gona make a simple anti youtube one
no more rustle jimmie pictures?
lol
05but sadly its hard to set exceptions
i dont know rather to sleep or pull a all nighter
/me 's jimmies are now very rustled
05and term it so people saying "go to youtube" doesnt get affected
jgjgj
05a simple one is banning http://
05but thats jsut silly
just have to set the filter for youtube to be www.youtube
I just found the single most, hands down, badass play ever.
hamlet?
Wrek, if is helps, go for it
youtube.c or youtu.be
think it not silly
that bans like all pages
wrek: people try getting around the kag thing by going: "G@k, G/-\k ect
:3
"ect."
nvm you got that covered :V
Imagine if hamlet, were written by orks.
Derpy_Hooves, i think he has that coverd
needless to say, Hamlet was a pretty badass play, very gory too
wrek, phase, lots people in the dash room spam the <3 like crazy
Derpy_Hooves, ikr
talkbing about 8 to 11 hearts in one go
there was a playhouse production of evil dead here in my area a couple years ago. it was pretty awesome in a cheap production sort of way
^^
but i <3 the <3 buttom
button*
Derpy_Hooves, the rainbow dash channel is the most active and wild pf all the side channels
there are also the russian speakers
of*
texasboykc09: i know, i help mod it on saturdays :I
no one goes to spike, i feel bad for it
Derpy_Hooves, i wish i can help to
Who wants to palce song requests?
Mr_Anybody: Isnt that the one without IRC?
this is why I go to Rarity, because it is a calmer board
i think so
Mr_Anybody: Then how would you know if anyone went there?
anything barely happens in spike i hear
Pinkie Pie was just perfect for me
Not too loud and not too quiet
but yeah, Wrek, Phase4, the <3 spam, russian language spam, oh yeah the constant "nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo" spam
i like crazy
those are the most troublesome ones
adding a script for those (if possible) would ease things up
05thing is
00,02i may also try check for emote spam
05theyre not the smae person
the ones where everyone types /me licked (some random guy)
05same*
im aware
05in 90% of the cases
05sso that needs ot be manually covered
if you say so
man, when did people start laying down the law here?
05Mr_Anybody: we always have
00,02well i don't plan to do any bans automatically
05we learn
05adapt
00,02that'd just be silly and anoying
05adn generalyl improve
05and yeah autobans wont happen
05sortign those manually is easier
well the only one that gets really bothers are the long ass "no" messages
Automatic bans may tend to mess up and ban for typing three characters: that happened in one of my servers when I typed: can i have some wood
XD
00,02Wrek, well i do have some ideas for automatically managing bans but they're for later
13,6 no moar lightIRC
00,02it wont create any on it's own
i can usually handle the emote, and russian spam
It's difficult for others not to use /me
05that color combo was suprisingly ugly to read
the nooooooo walls are quiet troublesome though
okay
what else...
no more lightIRC
Wrek, ikr
there

no clothes?

Phase4, are you going to do purple and green next?
00,02colours == clothes in irc speak
Unlock clothes at Level 25.
^
00,02GabeMoist, do what now?
Phase4, green text with purple background
00,02well not irc speak, #bronystate speak
13sigh..
13this is why we do not mess with water in minecraft
00,02GabeMoist, i don't remember what the colour codes are
my stomach hurts
lol
Shizuka, oh dear
what did you do?
my fault
one time i was mining and I made a contraption that made creepers step on automatic sentries
Phase4, how about purple text on your blue background
water obviously
So we're all nekkid and only the mods get to have clothes.
And the next block I mined
What kind of world do we liv in?
Water went all over all my redstone

We traded Rarity's fabulous episodes for those two?
well, Bye ^w^
hello everypony
yes
Damn
ohai Rex_Mundi
05you cannot trust EqD to be on time
maybe rarity gets a good part in the season finale
05never
Well might as well stay up!
I blame Seth.
Got nothing better to do.
which one of you numbnuts let us down?!
In the season finales, everyone knows Twilight gets the main role
I seriously have no idea what day is it.
brokenCrowning, but the thing is...she steals the episode. But the episode is never fully about her.
i agree rarity needs more episodes
i'm back
but she got so many in season 2
Rarity is best pony
just sayin
Rarity is awesome pony
^^^^^^^
well, only 7 more episodes left in Season 3...
I think episode about her could have potential
But not as awesome as Rainbow Dash
^
^^
I have to go to some sort of hockey game on monday, minor is the only hockey I'll get this year
those are wierd names to spell pinkie pie
I miss Rainbow Dash's old personality
Grrr.
in Season 1

So, stream. What's your favorite TV show besides MLP?
Luna changes Season 1 and 2

let's see...
ZeroPwny, One Piece
Adventure Time.
05GoT
Doctor Who
Death Note
Never liked anime
Breaking Bad, Walking Dead.
and occasionally walking dead
I used to like Deadman Wonderland...
But I agree with the Doctor Who thing
twd
walking dead is good but also meh at the same times
uh... My little pony?... damnit, its supposed to be a non-MLP show.
but I'm all about the 10th doctor
Sometimes Iron Chef.
05im a die hard old school cartoon fan
10th doctor is best doctor
I like Cromartie High School
then choose animaniacs
05tune in on stream durign a cartoon session and omg nostalgia
I cant wait for new DC nation block
Freinds
i cant watch the stream on my ipod i am sadfface

Ouran host club
Animaniacs is my childhood.
i love animaniacs, so many innuendoes and under the radar
is there any way i can watch poni stream on my ipod
The rainbow dash show
why must I wait though an intermission, it's like those trailers before the movie
You can consult the stream and see if they can fix or something

dat laggy chat
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9KiDzMaRiQ
gnight
OK guys, im not much of a shipper, i dont pretend thats theres any romance between the characters to find between the lines. But if the was a ship that I wuldnt mind turned out to be true, then its rarijack.
Sleep well Wrek.
or at least for me
go to bed you lazy bum
i dont ship
I sail :)
night Wrek
i fly
11,02\^-^/
MOW APPO FWITTUW
Rex_Mundi, anything with Rarity in it is a pretty interesting ship. But polar opposites like those two work...interestingly.
someone needs to kidnap the stream
SUPERBRONY!
SuperBrony64, \^-^/
Like what 4chan did before?
SuperBrony64, hello mooo
/me hugs SuperBrony64
What did 4chan do to the stream anyways
11,02Hai :D
Ohai
/me hugs Mr_Anybody back :3
you should stream meinkraft
eeww
no
:P
:[
y is it off air
11,02If anypony is interested, I'm going to be on the Bronyville podcast tomorrow at 12 PM PST if anypony wants to watch OuO
05firstly it wasnt 4chan, it wasnt /v/ it wasnt GNAA
apl fwittier
Ninjazz: Rarijack is much perferable to say, Fancypants X rarity, or... God forbid, SpikeXRarity
wut the hacked stream?
05it was a good for nothign streamsite wanting to steal viewers
i remember that
05secondly the ydidnt hack
Rex_Mundi, oh... the only "canon" ship. :D
05turns out our old provider provided the key to stream to it isnide its embedd
05you jsut had to look at our sites code and voila
05so it was a hijack
05at best
Ninjazz: NO... Spike has no chance at all with Rarity.
the off air pictures are making my typing laggy
best hijack ever?
Ninjazz: Fancy pants is too minor and is too old as well.
aren't you trying to sleep Wrek?
05i am.
yea
lame
try to type with your eyelids closed
while typing
wtf
fancypants is awesome
05magic.
its hard to leave chats:)
^
HEY HEY HEY! moo
11,02Moo o3o
Rex_Mundi, I know. But I like how people support it even though. Rarity and Fluttershy seem like they got a good shot, seeing as how they're best friends and do a lot of things together.
got mr is pretty east
AppleCrisp, ifr
DoctoDoctorWho: He is. But not right for my rarity.

SuperBrony64, can you stream for a bit?
yes
I can shoot lasers out of my eyes! Wait, what if I have to blink?
Rex_Mundi: But he is, the most interesting pony, in the wurrrrld. *Cue exotic guitar*
you should
So, still no stream?
Rex_Mundi, probably not a passionate romance type like Applejack and Rarity sounds like. Fluttershy and Rarity seem more like a close friendship at best. Like girl friends, not girlfriends.
but still "shipping" laws.
psst SuperBrony64 you should stream some of your mooness
Ninjazz: They are all ready good friends. No nead to 'friendship' them.

Not every episode has been leaked and how is this one leaked?
Phase4, thanks for the laugh in that comic
Phase4: Yup. I hate how people type the lines on the chat of what characters are going to say 5 seconds later.
Phase4: The premiere was leaked 4 hours before it showed.

Haku1013 actually they have come out with some pretty awesome sets
I HEARD THAT
dubstep is terrible
how dare you
I agree
Agrees
i oughta slap your goose until it's cooked
Karonia, again, Its better then what I thought it'd be, but its still not that great
KrazyNoobs, i'll be the one doing the banning lol
It's nice to hear your opinion.
Okay Haku1013
hey look buddy I'm an engineer that means I solve problems
fact
So is anyone going to answer my question?
In fact, there is a video that impersonates bronies responding to haters.
Practical problems
KrazyNoobs, can i take a peak of what going on in there
#Practical Problems
lol Skrillex thinks a Macbook is an instrument
Haku1013: Top Gun and Weird Science was the movie picks
Haku1013: Yep
dammit
teaxsboykc09|away: Come join in on the fun if you like.
:D
And le ponies?
KrazyNoobs, ill just watch the fun

Oh well
All I do is win
HOWS SPIKE CHAT GUYS?
Who knows that song?
Godzilla Final Wars, Bionicle 2, and MMDW will win eventually
ITS GODZILAAAAAAAAAAA
But due to copyright laws, it only looks like Godzilla, and really isnt
but we should still run like its godzilla

Yes, yes you did

Watch Topgear, play Minecraft, get pig.
In my opinion, Final Wars is tied for the best Godzilla film
stepping on a dublo was like stepping on a goddamn spike trap
BRB
Stepping on a Lego is like stepping on a rusty nail
slowly
legos? You mean my carpet?
lol
Haku1013: Lego's? Dont you mean, casual footwear?
I always stepped on the one forgotten lego
Spike Traps kill instantly, thus causing little to no suffering
But the rusty nail will kill you slowly
with infections and tetunus
Causing maximum suffering
tetANUS
?
-_-
google punji pit
it xauses a tight anus.
stepping on that one lego coming out of the goddamn shower and slipping into the shower and hurting your rib, thigh, retina and jugular vain
-_(\
ouch
it was an interesting story at the doctors
lol
I hate it when after a thunderstorm at 1am, it stop raining, you think you can finally go to sleep now, 30 seconds later, loudest thunder you've ever heard.
why the hell do you have legos in your bathroom
shit man
I love rainstorms
legos are like the plauge, they are fucking everywhere

I myself am hoping to see either Clayface or thr Riddler in the new Batman movie thatll come out for the JL thing
You know who needs to be in a batman JL thing?
penguin?
anyone?
No
Bye guys gotta go :D
:okay:
Penguin is good, but he's great
who needs penguin?
bye Karonia
Penguin can hire goons and stuf
f
Plus, with todays tech, Im sure Hollywood can make a pretty realistic Clayface
I always liked marvel better anyway
Well duh
they should put 2 face in it and i mean like old school 2 face
Marvel always makes the better films

Haku1013: Exactly, it is a proven fact that batman can beat anyone with enough prep time
So no, He's not the best hero then

Hulk vs destroyer of worlds
wait
Hulk, verses equestria
Flash Gordon
:3
hulk IS destroyer of worlds
I just pointed it out because of how Doomsday killed him and was a knock off of Hulk
he becomes so happy he turns into bruce banner
Hulk actually kills EVERYTHING in the universe in one comic
and teh ponies kill them
how long would it take hulk to destroy earth
him*
Sparklerific: 10
Without Banner the Hulk is a unstopable killing machine
10 hours?
I need my daily dose of Lag B Gone
10 days?
GO
Sparklerific: 9
DEATH BATTLE
k?
Banner is pretty much the only thing keeping the Hulk from wrecking everything
Not true the Hulk outlived Banner and was quite peaceful
NO GUYS

WE ARE TOPPA
GURREN LAGANN
Oh, off the air :-(
Hulk vs Celestia
Is that the DOCTOR? EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE!!!!!!!
Row row fight the powa?
Sparklerific: Please Celestia would lose easily
No one can defeat Celestia
Celestia cant do shit without Twight and co.
*Twilight
what is that a company?
Twight and co.
Celestia: well Ill just send him to the moon
Twight Howard.
what would they make?
Hulk on moon: SMASH
Okay only Twilight could defeat Celestia, but no one else
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Celly vs hulk, telekinesis is a bitch aint it?
Everytime some evil force showed up, Celestia lost easily
Celestia: shit, moons hurling towards equestria
kono Too bad the Hulk will end up using THE MOON AS A WEAPON
Surely the Elements of Harmony are strong enough to turn Hulk into stone
exactly
Celestia is this generation's Princess Peach.
She always uses Twilight as her lackey
Why would they turn him to stone?
celestia is the 9/11 of omnipotent beings
As Hulk says, "NO ONE CAN CONTROL HULK. HULK IS STRONGEST"
I'm thirsty, someone geet me a latteee
goo point, it should just turn him into bruce banner again
Never said HULK NEVER LEARNED GRAMMAR
kono I get it :)
or possible rid him of the hulk forvever
Celestia is worst ruler
^
Luna is best ruler, and we never see her doing anything
^
but best dictator
Princess Peach doesn't get a new army after being kidnapped by Bowser 8 times
what luna has done
NMM: Taken by surprise Discord: Omnipotent, duh Chrysalis: Supercharged on love
Well because Luna doesnt pull shit like celestia
Princess Peach actually KNOWS how to fight
Celestia is worst ruler, but best dictator
regained rank as royalty
in 1 day
I saw this theory that the only reason Chrysalis over powered her was that everyone would have been vaporized by the power of the sun had Celestia not taken a h bombs level of her own power to the face.
earned trust of ponyville
in 1 day
well, Haku's off
night yall
goodnight
warned twilight about night time
Cartoon physics save the day though.
What has Celestia done? Send 6 mortal ponies ot move a possibly violent dragon
WHICH ARE IMMUNE TO MAGIC
Sent Luna to ponyville and not inform her of what has changed
Trollestia at her finest
GUYS I HAZ MATCHUP
hulk vs TTGL vs Lord English
Lord English wins.
Elements of Harmony are meant to rid Chaos, Evil, and all things bad. Therefore it should cure bruce banner from the Hulk like Luna from nightmare moon
Luna may not do much but at least Luna is a total asshole
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She knew they'd be fine, or else they wouldn't have been sent
Because I'm already here
DoctoDoctorWho: THE POINT STANDS
Guys
?
The 'FBI' Locked my computer remotly :p
Not to mention Celestia shot down Twilight at the wedding and never said sorry
Bitch
Saying I need to pay a fine in the next 72 hours or else I will be charged...
Deadlypon3: are you using someone elses computer?
Twilight_sprinkle It's mine
Deadlypon3: i thought it was locked
And I swear, I haven't looked at any of that
I am using my laptop right now ^^'
She's been holding a grudge from when Fluttershy "stole" her pet Phoenix I guess.
Im seriously ranking the whole wedding fiasco as Celestia's worst moment
soo.... spike on AJ action?
wut did you do this time Deadlypon3
Twilight_sprinkle the worst I have looked at was Doujjin...
gandalf vs Princess Celestia
Mr_anybody I didn't hit anybody with my car this time :'(
lawl hobbit reference
Celestia banishing her sister probably ranks worse... That couldn't have felt good
you didn't hit me
Raise Twilight for years like a mother, DOUBT HER IMMIDEATLY
My step mother told me it was just someone fucking with me...
richfiles: Well that was nessicary
The other times is sheer dickery
Deadlypon3: how is it locked, what does it say
I thought so, since they said they can clear it all up by me paying a fine :p
Necessary don't make it better.
deadlypon3: plottwist, its your stepmother
maybe she banished her cuz she didnt have the strength to cure her
sure, ALWAYS listen to your step mother *end sarcasm*
>Have 5 friends, send 2 tickets
What
^
Twilight_sprinkle It says 'FBI has locked your computer' with the seal and all...to pay, use pay pal
She didn't meet her friends.
And that had to have nearly destroyed her on the inside...
Ninjazz: YES SHE DID
And how was she supposed to know they wanted to go?
And this happened where?
Kono OH PLOt twist...probably to teach me a lesson not to look at porn or Doujinn
We're watching this from Twilight's perspective.
Ninjazz At the CHILDS ORPHANGE :O...
And sorry, it's just...
Everyone always whines, "Sister wants more attention? banish her to the moon!" Well did anypony think of it this way? "Want more attention? Take over the world!"
Ninjazz: I dont know...WHEN LUNA WAS CURED
The profecy of her return was of twilight and her friends freeing her from the prison of nightmare moon
Deadlypon3: cant be legit, but ive never heard of that kind of hack in any case
Far be it for us to judge Celestia for not knowing every detail.
plottwist she is reading a doujin herself
SpadeKyurem[WoW], she didn't meet them.
The FBI found your P0rn folder Deadlypon3
Twilight_sprinkle even then, Why not just knock on my door?
They were right in front of her dummy
If I really am doing that, they would just come and arrest me, not make me pay a FINE
Now your just somepony that I used to know!
Deadlypon3: because it isnt legit
And that proves?
And how the hell does celestia not know what a parasprite is
You're being judgemental.
She's been around for how long?
Twilight_sprinkle yeah...now I got to erease my computer to get rid of the trojan
If the FBI finds my pron folder, they'd just think I worked in equine husbandry! :$ :D
richfiles Yeaah
I don't have a porn file
equius is that you?
I look in browsers :p
NO.jpg richfiles
They'd think I was REALLY BAD at it... Mares don't do that! :D
Ninjazz: She sent Twilight to make friends to acess the elements so THERE IS NO EXCUSE
Deadlypon3: i dont think you need to erase it, just scan with a good antivirus
But I am going through all my computer stuff and cleaning it all
Spadekyurem She knew, she was just trolling
Lovebug have not been around long and there a pest sometimes bugs just appear
Twilight_sprinkle It's 'locked' so no dice
:33< equius how are you this purrfect day?
SpadeKyurem[WoW], she sent them for Spike and Twilight alone. Is there a problem with that?
well if you are areested and brought into questioning, don't mention us
Deadlypon3: also the first letters in my name arent capitalized, start typing my name and then press tab to autocomplete
D--> e%cellent
The worst part is explaining to my step mom why I was going around sites that might make me panic about 'pedophilia' or beastiliaty
And maybe Twilight could have just asked Celestia for 4 more tickets herself.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Everyone always blames celestia for not helping ponyville, have you seen canterlot? Its like, 80 miles away!
That could have solved things quicker, hmm?
But noooo.
DoctoDoctorWho: TELEPORTATION
it's Celestia's fault.
why does it say only 4:40 tiil the new episode???
Deadlypon3: look up something on the internet on how to unlock it, or ask some computer techies we got here like Phase4
:33< Your dancestor gave me the creeps...
ponies man, they make the FBI lock your computer
Deadlypon3: actually if thats windows he might not know, but you can also ask Shizuka
twilight_sprinkle I'm sure my step mom will figure it out, she knows already.
00,02?
D--> his smile is quite 100d
Phase4 we are just discussing porn, go back to sleep :p
20% of the intornets is filled with poneez
Phase4: Deadlypon3 said he had his computer hacked and locked
Still shaking.
00,02but i'm not tired :)
00,02i meen :(
I am really shaking stll
00,02silly () being next to each other
Thought I would be labeled as a sex offender...
sparklefic, but its still 100% filled with Bullshit
Phase4: but he says he'll figure it out, so i guess the ping was unnecessary, sorry
...AND WHO IS THAT HIP DUDE WITH THE STYLES
Vegetarians dont exist in the world of ponies... because that's everyone!
Deadlypon3: relax man, you just need to calm down, and look at pictures of ponies aight
twilight_sprinkl ever had this happen to you
I still dont see how Celestia barely put up a fight when Nightmare Moon returned, you would think she would at least try to fight back
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Doesnt matter, if you were ruler, and you knew that the best mage in the kingdom lived in that town, who also happened to be the chosen one, along with her 5 friends who are formidable in their own rights, would you not trust them to be able to take care of the weekly crisis?
...I'm scared cause I think it might get me arrested :(
berb what about timberwolves?
no Deadlypon3 like i said, ive never heard of such things
00,02Deadlypon3, oh, you got your computer infected with something
D--> though i STRONGLY agree with his choice of statuary
Deadlypon3: and no, im sure its not the actual fbi, tehy wouldnt ask you to pay over paypal
DoctoDoctorWho: Still screams lazy to me, to not handle problems of your kingdom yourself and not send the help
hey is SuperBrony64 still mooing around here?
Phase4 yeah...for a brief minute or two, I actually thought the FBI is charging me with pedophilia
Timberwolves are carnivores.
00,02Deadlypon3, try reboot in safe mode
And dragons are immune to magic so the whole dragon issue was stupid
Imma go to bed now. :) I have a definite hope that Luna might invade my dreams!... Last night All I got was a zombie Star trek dream on a spacestation... It was all a prank, but the actual startrek cast was there by chance... The runnnig joke was there can only be one kirk, one spock, etc... And the whole prank had hoards of spock and kirk and other trek characters done as zombies... It has HILARIOUS... But no ponies...

SUperbrony64 great! We are talking about porn
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Lets put it this way, if the president could teleport, are we supposed to just sit on out ass and wait for him to fix all our criminal, nat disaster, and social problems? Didnt think so.
Phase4: /)

Superbrony64 :)
DoctoDoctorWho: Im saying she could fucking help

SuperBrony64: i got a android too, a samsung galaxy :D
o wait, they say 12:50 in pm/am too... am/pm suck
I got hacked by some trojan thingie, claiming it's from the FBI
Not let Twilight do all the damn work LIKE EVERY TIME
is the loto today?
Danm I don't rp eq well enough to really know how to reply -_-'
yeah i got that too. it locked down my PC :T
lordenglish, try roleplaying as the opposite gender...
rename the 7 stages of guilt with the 7 stages of Derpy
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She has a kingdom to run if you havent noticed
Hey Princess Celestia, get your lazy ass off that porn and do all those jobs yourself
that is kinda awkward...
Northern_charge I actually did thought it was the FBI at first for a few minutes
DoctoDoctorWho: Right...and she does that so welll...not
we need a stream going
stage 1: I just don't know what went wrong
I'm not sur how that will help???
Northern_Charge: what did you do?
i ended up having to pack up the files on my HD and do a factory restore D:
Its always Twilight do this Twilight do that....and she just sits on her throne doing jack all
stage 2: wreck alot off stuff
B-But I BOUGHT A LOT OF STUFF ON STEAM :'(
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: name one major problem that equestria has that we dont thats 15x worse.
it will till all be on steam :o
/me climbs onto SuperBrony64 head
What if...princess celestia spends her entire days watching my little hoofbeast: moraillegince is magic
SpadeKyurem[WoW], I think you have the problem where you think Celestia is supposed to be a perfect being. She has flaws, as you obviously are aware, but keep rejecting that she has good sides too.
Northern_Charge But mah moneiz and the deals
Stage 3: say your sorry... while "trying" to mess things up further
steams online so it will remember it
Sparklerific Stop quoting my stages when my computer is ruined by virus
sorry, tryig noy
/me gets on SuperBrony64 back
Should I get Terraria?
Ninjazz: No what Im implying is she does jack all in terms of helping with big issues like Discord or Chrysallis or Sombra...
/me picks up aniderp|bestcakeever and gives her a hug 'Dat is DeathStar's spot :3'

Deadlypon3: your account on steam is saved on the steam server, whether otr not you change computers it doesnt matter
imo
Deadlypon3 I'm not sure wat u mean
...I need to take my pill to calm ahself
-lays in SuperBrony64 arms and hands him a moo toy-
SuperBrony64: they have a 3d pony app thing for android
Sparlerific I will miss all the steam sales :O
I should sleep...
And I just finished Spec Ops the line
where was I
goodnight uys
...SPEC OP THE LINES DID THIS
silly SuperBrony64, your supposed to use "" when talking
guys*
SpadeKyurem[WoW], says who? We are watching from Twilight's perspective ALL the time. Infact, she was sending Twilight her own friendship reports to help in some way. That itself shows that she's doing things off screen. Why are you judging her on whether or not she's on screen doing something.
yeah i wasnt happy about what happend either XD but i think of it this way. at least i dont have to clean all the junk off my PC now.
SuperBrony64: yo super you should give me your gmail so I can stalk you :3
stage....4 I believe
Ninjazz: Well lets see...she sends twilight after the elements and thats all she does
Deadlypon3: Pillz nawt gud, y u take pillz?
She sent her to Ponyville to make friends.
Stage 4: give your friend a derpy smile :P
Goodnight guys, gonna go get a little sleep before the episode, see yall in a few hours ^_^
SuperBrony64: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/12/window-to-equestria-3d-ponies-everywhere.html
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWfToMXA43c Did this battle a little while ago, it's a shitton harder than it looks.
DoctoDoctorWho They are offically prescribed...forgot to take them today
Stage 5: Feel sad because people think your offensive
The government is getting so debt-ridden that the FBI is asking sex offenders to pay to avoid getting registered :p
OOPS
twilight_sprinkle: this is the portal to equestria!! :D
...That sounds like an onion headline
Stage 6: Feel better knowing millions out there still love and apreciate who u are
you found it
Sparklerific Stop making me feel happy :'(!
That damn boss was very hard, kills you at level 36 in just two hits
Deadlypon3: I feel for you man, hope all that clears someday :P

i closed that parenthesis for you Phase4, now you wont get a chat compilation error!
DERPEH
...I am now going to play Persona 4 Golden while listening to Talkradar :O!
What's also horrible
I'm not trying to imply that Celestia needs to be perfect but she could take some time out of her day to get off her flank and so something to help instead of letting her lackey Twilight and friends to do it for her
Celestia is an awesome ruler, everypony just cant appreciate the crap she does for equestria.
NEEDA STREAM HERE!
This boss has INFINITE health until you are able to perform Data Drain.
...Speaking of INFINITE.
A streamer will stream when they feel like doing so, Mr_Anybody.
Anyone seen the new Bioshock Infinite Trailer :)?
anyways that was the 7 stages of derpy I just made up. I guess that sounded beautiful, huh?
Oh theres some evil theatening my kingdom? Better get Twilight to handle it for me!
Sparklerfic I suppose
ok my stomach is hurting so I'm going to bed
R-r-r-r-rattle me bones.
Mr_anybody baaai
gngiht streamies
Mr_Anybody: gnight, hope your stomach gets better
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: So what was that when twi was having a magical meltdown? She walked up, PUT A HOOF ON HER SHOULDER, and stopped it.
no problem
And for you saying she might be doing something off screen is bull, theres no implication she ever does anything
So for all we know she's doing jack all
And there's no implication that she wasn't doing anything as well. You're just ranting.
Hey Everypony! Where is this reference from:
B-B-B-BlOODY SCREEN! -SO REAL!-
so what's going on?
Im back.....i cant sleep
Anypony get the reference?
no

The trailer/game from the people who made BulletStorm :p
Really....prove me 3 things celestia has done that was helpful that didnt require Twilight doing all the work
I'm back.
wb KrazyNoobs
posting memes...that's a paddlin'
Celestia Raises the sun
oh hey, the stream is actually working for once.
can Twi do that>
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Unfucking ponyville from twilights own want it need it spell
Thats once
And the sun doesnt count
I gotta go...the FBI is charging in with guns blazing for me looking at a picture of derpy with socks on :)
Actually yes it does.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Yes the sun counts
AppleCrisp: no but she can raise the moon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KafNXjIh4MU
Deadlypon3: I know, the fuzz is getting stricter and stricter.
D:
No it doesnt thats pretty much her damn job...she still doesnt do anything to help when evil invades
tackeart even just staring at these pictures flying past is enough to get us all the death setence :P
bye everypony again
tackeart: that's why i live in canada.
..wat
Deadlypon3: that's why i live in canada.
0_o
Oh really. So you mean doing her job doesn't count. So by that logic, Twilight doing what Celestia told her to do doesn't count at all then. Cause that's what she's supposed to do because that's Twilight's job as her student.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the changling invasion, she lost but she still got up to help
DoctoDoctorWho: And that did what exactly?
*Dragged off* AVENGE ME!!!
AVEEENGE MEEEEE!
THIS is how you build up a final boss in a first installment, make sure he never talks, show him killing (or coma-ing in this case) a mentor type character right from﻿ the start, give little mention of him outside of the player character's mentioning, thus building him up as being some force of nature (or otherwise) rather then a character, then after the PC finally kills him somehow, show that he was a just a soldier answering to a higher p
Deadlypon3: See ya!
Got her ass kicked
I really cannot adore this picture enough http://fav.me/d5pbe45
...*Gunshot*
and yes I really love her mane
a lot
Pointless. You're just ranting.
...So yeah, I will see you ponies later
Right like you can defend her being oh so helpful
..I just realized Sombra is the villain that got the closest to actually injuring the Mane Six.
Man, just wait till the season 3 finale...
Wish Sombra had a bigger part
Discord didn't want to injure them
CrystalPhoenix, I have no words.
guys
No one simply owns words.
Berberborscing: They only had 13 episodes, so they had to pack all the awesomeness into them.
all posts landing on atime that ends in 0 are true facts
I really love a look into the future MLP pictures
^
Ill show you every picture of the next episode.
lol
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: The want it need it spell, raising the sun every day, and basicly saving equestria from every major threat ever 1000 years ago.
Especially involving the CMC.
wth did luna do to be banished for 1000 years?
Five bucks the CMC never get their cutie marks this season.
Celestia is about as useful as a sack of bricks when she isnt raising the sun
^
Ninjazz, one major reason I love Slice of life Ponies
^
berberborscing: Try to take over and kill everyone
Celestia is there to troll man
PLEASE NOTE: The first and last two episodes of every season are where things get serious. The rest is the general shenanigans of the Mane Crew.
she is very usfull
lol.
very true
CrystalPhoenix, same.
Luna complained ponies didint apreciate her night, even though most ponies were probably fucking asleep
Not us...
I sleep when the sun comes up
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I don't think Luna understood pony sleep cycles and the natural instinct of ponies to fear the night's many predators.
...
Fluttershy awakens at night
Fluttershy is a crummy pony.
So, I made a comic at my school. My school is mostly anti-brony.
So I made it almost the same as MLP but with ants.
lets not open this window, please
RawketLawnchair: :O how could you!?
And they loved it.
DoctoDoctorWho: Truth hurts.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cSzICMc_bw
tackeart: Ya see to me that makes me think Nightmare Moon happened due to a hissy fit essentally
:P
@doctoDoctorWho Unleash the ninja rabbits!
Luna's the worst, so is Fluttershy.
no
luna is best princess
Nope.
sea ponies are best ponies
There all the best
trixie is the wors
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Either that, or she wanted to make the night look fancier, and there was a curse on the book to make the eternal night spell look like 'etheral night'
worst*
Also how does one rule over anything with no sunlight
I may have taken that from a fanfic somewhere, yes.
You need sunlight to grow food
RawketLawnchair: agreed about fs, but i do like luna
DoctoDoctorWho: Aside from iron will and discord, when did she ever do anything wrong
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Live in the caves. Biolumineces and stuff.
Do you even dorf?
lel
You cant rule over dead ponies
Wait, RawketLawnchair be trollin
DoctoDoctorWho: Nah. It's the truth.
RawketLawnchair: +1 for dorf fortress reference
Ah Dwarf Fortress where losing is fun!
Luna has more power than Celestia if you think about it.
^
yup, he be trollin
lol2cat and such.
The best thing about DF is seeing how badly it ends
berberborscing: here we go...
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I think there's a pony version of DF.
:)
berberborscing: No.
berberborscing: but celestia banished her
So anyway, I'm off to try out the UDK.
Bai!
berberborscing: how?
bye tackeart
see y'all tomorrow
Luna raises all the stars that are all suns that could be larger than the one sun Celestia controls
berberborscing: how?
Can I ask what can exactly thrive in terms of food in eternal night?
berberborscing: Luna raises the moon, you dope.
And the stars.
13just put down torches
Good point
I dont think Luna thought out the whole eternal night out so well
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Magic crops.
13wheat will grow fine
underlining isn't coloring
Luna doesn't do anything with the stars, she just raises the moon, ya doof.
Im also so eternal night would allow predators to run rampant
doofhamd
she raises the stars too
So...yea
doofhand*
*sure
In one clip: Luna says " I have to raise all the stars too?" and Celestia says "You know, I'll raise the stars one night for you
How do you know this?
berberborscing: thats fanon though
berberborscing: Show me the clip.
the stars are visable after celestia lowers the sun
LOL
Im going to assume since Luna can transform, Im going to assume Celestia can do the same
I have one question....where was spike in the canterlot weddding???
AppleCrisp: Sleeping.
Playing with the wedding toppers
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkpRUhdVNmU
>Implying thats canon
Nah.
berberborscing: Your star theory has no more proof than mine, so mine, being more feasable, becomes the norm by default
13uh no
13occam's razor
Luna still has more power than Celestia, she can fucking control dreams
yfw they gon make Twilight move the stars. CONSPIRACY.
Celestia cant do that shit
13equestria exists in a skydome
13the two princesses rotate the dome
^
twilight will be the new absolute supreme empress
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: She can't. She just visits.
13it's not that one raises the sun and one raises the moon, they just take turns moving the dome
OMG thats true luna can go in dreams
Do you even watch the show.
13thus why celestia did th job alone for so long
What if the princesses dont control the sun and moon at all and they just say they do? *insert consperacy reeves here
sorry i just got here will the stream be picking up soon or only in the real morningbhours?
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: and the worst that does is nightmares, still not as scary as a goddess throwing sunbolts at you
Shizuka: Nah she just sets the time command to what ever she feels like :P
13/time set day
Celestia and Luna playing minecraft would be hilarious
celestia and luna are simply scootaloo's pawns, she is the true ruler of the u\world
*world
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Please just stop hating on celestia, she has done nothing to deserve it.
Scootaloo huh, i can live with that
No I think she has enough for me to warrent hate
Hello every one
Hello Drinking_Water :3
hai Havok
I have to get up at about 2 am to just watch this? OK!!!
Hello Drinking_Watter>
that or celestia and luna are automatons funded by diamond tiara, after all like mr krabs said, its money that makes the world go round
Oh hia
hai*
hello AppleCrisp
13what is today but yesterday's tomorrow
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Old imperial quote, modified for the situation. "What has celestia ever done for you? What have you ever done for celestia?"
Diamond Tiara for season 3 finale villain?
Dang if i sleep im going to miss the whole episode i have to pull a all nighter
I know its kinda late
Shizuka: Saturday?

So anyone want to take guesses on what new eldritch evil will be unleashed on Equestria next?
Same, ponies give a reason for my lack of sleep.
Who uploaded the link that was total ear rape?
XD
I watched that
Difference? I belive so!
I don't think it's good for a 13 year old to be staying up until 4:50am! :D
The solar empire can go to hell
I really wish they waited a while before uploading it to iTunes
pro tip: you need to be at least 14 to be here
dayum
can't they get in trouble with hasbro for that?
:(
What is it, the third episode that got leaked in a row?
I'm 13.
its not like a few hours makes much difference
>.>
so at least pretend you're 14..
Dont kick me please, I lvoe this.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Too bad we're too far up here to do that lol

DON'T KICK ME PLEASE...

Yep.
berberborscing: well if it were up to me i wouldnt until rule violation, but its not up to me
I promise not to kick you, but I'm also not a mod
ok ok
I'm REALLY SCARED now
Ponies r srz buisness
Saying "dont kick me" in all caps is digging your own grave there...
LOLOL my pinkie pie snap band literally just lauched itself out of nowhere XD
I though the lives stream was over.
yeah, when does it start?
I﻿ don't think I'd know how to react if the giant, disembodied head of Biz Markee came beatboxing down at me from a cornfield.
Man i want the french flim anf flam back
Hi everypony im back
and*
arguments?
I remember on bronystate they used to live stream up until the episode, I don't know when they stopped doing that...
:|
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8MZRmsQyRs&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
Was... That asuka? Holding a pony?
does anyone know when it starts?
Hi Krazy
Can someone tell me the reason for different theatres? I don't get it
I wonder when the episode starts.
...
No wait a sec
I think its because of so many people, they dont want cluttered chatrooms
MasterSonic10: Each theatre has a different chat room during the episode
oh ok
Thanks! :)
to handle more people and have people actually able to chat
lol yeah :D
This is a normal video until the 5th second. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keu1voAmcmY
other wise too much is said too fast and the stream crashes because too many are on
but thats always so much fun!
If you like immaturity and trolls, go to Rainbow Dash Room, if you just want to watch the stream and chat with other bronies without spoilers, go to other rooms.
So... this is the fun room?
Yes
sweet
lol that video
I love crazy and no sense crap
This room closes down during the episode.

Hi SuperBrony64
11,02Hai :D
Wha? WHY?
Why does this room close?
why close best poni room?
hello blue man
This room closes because too many people are on it
Why does everypony hate celestia?
SuperBrony64: im guessing you didnt see the android app i linked to you earlier?
Because with about 1k people in this room at once, the messages will be going by too fast.
case in point, this is the fun room and everyone knows it
02,11 makes a good combination.
because she's lazy doctor
bullshit
But this room is best pony :(
Whens the pre-stream going to start?
indeed
I have no idea
well ima off ill be back in 3-4 hours

Forte: There already is a Spike room
The moderator said when they wake up they would start it
Yes
I want ponies, damnit!
Spike is my next fav character
They have to sleep, because in murica, it is around 3 or 4am.

Eventually it might

If it does, i'll just start it back up.
Warhammer is a meme?

wow, an hour already passed
CRREDDDDD
dat slippery bastard
Time flies when you are having fun.

fun can be had at any tiem
even when in jail, just roleplay or something
Fun? What?
I have a Neo Geo AES, Along with a MVS.
Fun is banned on BronyState
Is it just art now?

There can never be fun here.
AdamTheDuck: You don't say!

I hope I can stay awake long enouf this time :P

Critical Hit.

brb
Just kidding. ( ^_^)
# Give me, a kiss to build a dream on #
# and my imagination, will make that moment live #
# sweetheart, I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream onnnn #
Buck the hackers!
see that rainbow dash 1 I posted, so cool
XD
( .__.)
oh my god
o.o
how did the chat reach a new level of stupidity
o.o Main?
my little pony my little pony ah ah ah ah
Bronies! Let's start this! Show this petty hater who's the toughest!
It doesn't surprise me anymore, Buytoast.
Who?
^
https://boards.4chan.org/b/res/447012132 Again, on /b/
some dumbass made a thread on /v/ pretending to be a le epic hacker and told mane that one of the hackers made it and shit
The biggest mistake that they've ever made!
i mean come on
yes lets show them who's boss
how can people be so stupid?
Welcome to the internet
I will be your guide
No who are we showing who's toughest?
They dun't lurk enough.
You guys do know this makes us no better than them right?
No srsly.
lol
The haters!
The HACKERS>
You learn the answers to everything if you just lurk.
Uboa-San, we're all so impressed you can make threads on 4-chan
oh right... LET'S GET THEM!!!!
I suggest we ignore them
but it's getting annoying
Hehe, that's what I pretty much did when I first came here
Spade does have a point.
yeah
was too shy to talk anyway :P
Acting like this makes us no better than them
that's what you're pretty much supposed to do
so... we're pretty much inviting them now...
you learn everything if you just let others ask and talk about it
niggastolemyspacebar
XD
Doing this shit is essentally asking for it
-_-
I skipped a step. I just made sure whatever I said wasn't stupid and held my opinion to myself.
I dont know what the problem is. Even if they do it, the ep will be on youtube 1-2 hours after air time...
Not sure...how I did but eh.
It's out on iTunes already
The audio is a little messed up though
Yeah, but thats not the point
i knew i should've gone to bed earlier today
Oh by the way, This is my first time on this!
They won't hack us... They're just bluffing.
It shows.
SO now I get to react with other Bronies!
I found a thread on /v/, they say they're going to raid bronystate(again).
lets not forget love and tolerance guys
these people are going to give me an aneurysm
oh now I see whats going on :D
hmm?
Wha?
...
it's not even amusing anymore.
Okay, Blitz. You're right.
just the usual "fear" mongering, attention seeking etc. Nothing to worry about.
And how often do people say that they are going to hack us?
usually
What I love the most is that you have not shown any proof of this claim, GrayHoof.
I DRAW SO GOOD ON MY CINTIQ
Yeah, I cant find it
https://boards.4chan.org/v/res/168989348
thank you.
yes this is going good, so very good
oh... well, there it is
But if they WERE Going to hack us, they wouldn't wait
I dont think they're going to
words are a lot easier than action
ФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФ
They're going to attack when the stream starts.
you know, i should be surprised at just how stupid you people sound and are acting right now
I'm worried, this is one of my favorite websites...
but it's the weekend
who is attacking?
Anonymous...
They aren't Anonymous.
How are we stupid?
nobody is attacking, Uboa-San just made a fake threat and you all are dancing like monkeys to an organ grinder
they are anonymous(technically)
I was just trolling /v/
Yeah, but we're all just having fun, I think.
Oh, I just logged on and missed some and got worried
I mean, we're all bored here
The same guy posted a weak attention seeking message on two boards and didnt receive much support as I can see. Like I said: attention whoring, nothing to worry about. (and I'd bet he/she is posting these here to get more attention :D )
Once the time has come, I will rustle those who fell for the troll, (Except bronies)
and yet, we give him the most attention of all
this is fun lets see if they keep posting
may be bored, but don't go shitting up /v/
Ignore them I say
o god what if one of them is in the chat right now...
aww ok
They keep posting the same thing though "You cant stop us"
Indeed, I dont condone taunting anyone
This makes us no better than them you know
Well Spade
They said "Fuck Love and Tolerance"
and now we mean shit.
So?
How many fucking bronies actually even follow that anymore
we just need to love and tolerate harder
oh no, they don't like love and tolerance!
it's the end of days!
goddamn kid
.....nothing, OP didn't deliver.
who gives a shit
They sound no better than the 7th and 8th grade idiots at my middle school
guys stop, there is a troll in our midst
If they were going to hack us, they would have done it already

Nipples The Enchila
go back to reddit
appears there i a mute option for bronystate
EP leak on iTunes...
is*
So when are we gonna watch movies
I was wondering that, did that already happen?
No, now i found a post that the objective is to leak Spike at your Service,
I think they aired earlier.
i think they were all already aired, I wanted to watch them but mustve been late
btw my name is dante
I love how I suggest the sane thing to do and ignore them but some dumbass is antagonizing them
you must have bronystate gold if you don't you can't watch movies
yea what knucklshy said
I hate you all
OriginalTheCharacter: movie night starts in 9 hours
Goodnight Shizuschlafen
https://boards.4chan.org/mlp/res/6931899 This is the link, CLOSE IT!
Uboa-San, at least stop saying you're somehow 'finding' them
we know you're making them
This is such a loving chat room
All troll attempts,
how can we know he's doing it?
it's getting old
I hate you too
It's almost impossible to identify someone on 4chan.
Im not saying he is or isnt but how do you suggest he's the one doing it?
hwo do you keep posting them as they are made...
Hello everypony.
fag
I deleted the leak thread
how*
AppleCrisp: it usually is, but it takes only one persistant jerk...
hello
Hi pyro
hello
we're in a strange mood right now, some of us are less than polite in here
id say that too, even me
who wants to fuck some horses
or, me too
:D
*sigh*
Not me.
SpadeKyurem[WoW] he's finding them seconds after they're made
i mean c'mon
this is how I spend my nights?
Hey so are you guys okay with futa
even you can connect the dots
hell yea
THIS IS ThE BEST WAY TO SPEND NIGHTS IMO

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSr_JVTp8fI Thinking of getiing the new Most Wanted? Check out this clip!
I just watched Every. Single. Episode of Baccano! in one sitting.
buts its great
and you see what happens?
Minutes before stream starts, I will delete the Thread to rustle jimmies of Anonymous,
Played NFs Most Wanted
baccano, what anime was that again
?
Not sure if will backfire or not
Need For Speed over time evolved into Burnout...
we get Donte the Demon Killer
NFS sucks
screw ea
I still need to catch up with that anime Pryo
apple fwitter
NO :[
YES
So who are the idiots atagonizing 4chan?
u
I don't know, DONTE, some of the NFS games were alright.
I hate Omegle
XD
NFS dropped in profit after carbon...
I suggest to ignore them and people go ahead and anger them
only if you say you are SpadeKyurem[WoW]
i think it might be "not-plural" as in one sad forchanner
I kinda liked Carbon...
nfs sucked when they started the underground ricer scene
Carbon was the last "good game" people thought
.
Good games?
LOL JK
Play They Bleed Pixels.
It's not really Ananymous
o god here we go :P
My only problem with NFS games was it seemed that the AI is cheating many times.
they bleed pixels sounds awesome

Early Youtube episoide post: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sORefyj4J2U

In fact, don't even call yourself one.
Underground 2 I enjoyed.

Not bronies, the ones who are anonymous
VOCAL MINORITY
And then they assume every brony is fucking stupid
Rainbow_Dash_BEBBEH No one is streaming at the moment.
Underground 1 was too hard.

GrayHoof I've played Shattered Skies

SpadeKyurem[WoW] No, you're not.
No you are not the only one.

Best snowboarding series: SSX (Besides On Tour)
sorry... :?
:/
It's fine.
I was trying to troll /v/
The need for speed was the best tho
tony hawk makes the best snowboarding games!
Why?
you did a terrible job at it
and it sorta worked, was funny
Donte, what games do you like?
>trying to trolls /V/ you have even less social life than anyone there
Please, tell me why you would even attempt at doing so, Uboa-San.
naw i liked that I got them quads really made my day
hell, you had to come in here and pretend it was an attempt at attacking this site just to get your troll to work
DmC
i mean shit man
that's just bad
I'm betting everypony cried when Chopper died *manly tears*
obviously
4chan is something that you enter will all your fun and leave missing most of your sanity
Its for revenge for them hacking this stream when one bad apple aired,
well, c'mon, we all knew he was a troll, right?
chopper?
'hacked'
Oh boy.
You're a twat Uboa-San.
nobody hacked the stream you fool
Aussie is here.
are you literally this inept?
435yuio
Uboa-San: Let it fucking go man!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PztAxiQKvxE
In my school, the students punish pony talk with humiliation...
love and tolerate, you guys
Uboa-San was not them, was not a "hacked" i agree with Jmo
wut...:/...
Jesus I was angry at that but I let it go! Your just being petty and childish
dat vid is un-apealing, sorry but I never played the game that much
Phase4 I think your shuttles on Kerbal space program have some competition.
00,02DashWithRainbows, indeed
shit Uboa-San it wasn;'t even /v/ who hijacked the stream
00,02frankly i don't care who hijacked the stream
who likes the ending of me 3
But it said that /v/ hacked the stream.
Uboa-San, let it go.
00,02they can't do it again so bleh
Move on.
I hope it wont backfire
Case closed
00,02Uboa-San, could have said santa did it
It's not hard to point the blame at someone else.
It wasn't hacked by /v/ or the GNAA.
I was so happy when I beat .hack//infection
It was hijacked by another stream, end of story.
fag
.hack//infection? is that a game
Yes
00,02DONTE, o_O
ive watched the show of hacksign
no its shit
cool
Forget about that everything and continue
I recommend getting it if you dont
anyone here have played persona 4 or 3, those were great
Its a great game for PS2
Uboa-San: You juse seem content in starting a flame war and not caring about the reprocussions
no u
i have xbox only, sadly./...

He's into fighting games.
Phase4: Nope
im so distracted!
/me is distracted
Almost the same as .hack//SIGN but with different characters, like Kite, BlackRose and Mia
Phase4 used pretty colors... it's not very effective
You'll recognize BlackRose
And Elk looks like the main character
it works better on the "stupid" brony type
and then I said something else
i was on chat for another good 45 mins time to find somthin ealse to do see yall later
Thats the one major thing about this fandom that pisses me off
wut?
Everyone at my school plays Naruto Shippuden...
derrrrp
We have fanatical morons who make the entire fandom look fucking stupid
my gt is xXThe_DemOn_KiLLaH_420Xx
yea, but thats the same for all fandoms usually
every culture has them
^eeyup
When I get an XBox, ill be sure to add you donte
And then everyone hates us because some assholes cant be sensible
Spade THats every fandom EVER!
OBJECTION! Case Closed!
some of the "asswholes" migth just be actually trolls tho, just putting that out there
like you
some are, yes
I dont see why we cant just watch the show and everyone be fine with it
no u
pheonix write is best inturrupting cow
We watch a show, who cares?
OBJECTION
pony69 is the troll
My school is a hive of jerks who all think they're the king
donte pls
like this shithole
goobi
But that's normal
Where is Wrek when you need him.
School is so ghetto that mom jokes never get old.
lol
krogan?
Yeah, my roommate is a brony hater... it isn't fun
commander shephard thinks applejack is best pony
and he might be right
no hes dead
lol
People need to give things at least a chance...
I still dont see any justified reason to hate the show other than you just dont like it
Not just deny it and stay the same forever
well, we all did, didn't we? And now we're here
If you dont like the show, not my problem, just leave the people who like it alone
If the troll plan doesnt backfire, It will be safe to watch your Episode
people dont like different... its in our nature
maby they are scared we will take over like all of the US's or the wolrds culture or something
you just saw the fallout of someone using horses to try and troll /v/ and you're wondering why people hate the show
I saw the teens react to MLP, only one teen rated it AFTER seeing it.
1 its sucks 2 its stupid and 3 i hate it
actually that just sounded stupid i take that back
Uboa-San: And if it does Fuck you asshole
Uboa-San: You caused this so if shit goes down its your problem
wow, pony64... got some plans there?
says asswhole on ponysite and means it, gunna make me cry
Since the thread was deleted, Whats reaction?
I do, I actually have plans to take over Cuba already
D:
NOT CUBA!
good
Castro's guana be in for it soon
Holy mother of Celestia guys, stop this!
:P
sorry dude
This is tearing us all apart!
https://7chan.org/be/src/135553840158.jpg
is tis
Uboa-San: Why the fuck would you purpously atagonize a commnity and expect this to blow over
Ummm
he's a dumbass
You are tearing me apart Lisa!!!!!!
Uboa-San: Get the fuck out you moron
just leave him
Donte, that's an odd image
but may the new episode hold us all together through this harsh battle
let it go, spade. This is what he wants
wut do you think ponyfags?
THANK YOU DONTE
Donte, if you don't like ponies, why are you in a pony forum?
spade, i blocked that guy already dont even know what ur yelling at just saiyan
I dont know whats happening but I encourage you all to use the Ignore function in this chat :)
11,02I am the millipede \^-^/
yea use ignore on him plz
dude
/me slaps SuperBrony64 around a bit with a large trout
adorable
/me is eating popcorn
I muted him!
been working today
Or, even better, SB, can you whip up a ban for this guy?
just git back
If donte doesn't like ponies, why is he in a pony chat?
11,02Which guy?
wut
DONTE.
^
also hia chat thing
does it ban ip or just the name?
I just love these arguments, they are so entertaining.
what, not donte, he's a glorious bastard
there's an argument here..?
kind of
well, he did break the rules by posting a picture of a vagina
i dont even see his comments anymore so dont use my vote
its real pony vagina
DONTE your name reminds me of that emo character from a game
is that what that was?
or my word in this actually
Russian brony are gays :з
SuperBrony64 hello
Donte, we just watch an animated show about friendship. Is that too much to ask?
Forgot to +b, SuperBrony64.
SuperBrony64 you need to ban first
im gunna unmute and see what he is saying
gyhuijk
derp you r just spamming now
golly
come back and u have lost all your dignity
We don't go to ranches and start fucking horses. We stay at home and enjoy rather amusing shows.
YAH
forgot +b again SuperBrony64
Sorry for what i did, Some brony hater brought me unconscious and started all this craze,
that's -b
that's something but better to ignore him until he either rages or cries himself to sleep again
hm
Nobody wins a pony argument with me >:D
there it is
/me es bueno
Cheers, SB, now let's wait to see who else Uboa-San has brought here.
hearth's warming eve luna is best luna

I WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN THAT BRONY HATER IMPRESONATED ME AND STARTED ALL THE CRAZE!
sorry caps
bullshit
Right'
Asking for /v/ to "hack Bronystate".

Thats every one's excuse
I just cant take that seriously, uboa

Uboa-San: Who the fuck do you think your fooling
I think im fooling your fool

Hopefully Nobody hacks the stream,

Uboa-San: And if someone does, its your fault douche
hello
Hi
well, the new episode got released early again on iTunes, I just hope I'll get it in time for the meetup >.<
Donte knew why he went away.
When someone doesn't like ponies, I don't stand down from my position.
SuperBrony64 lick my finger
he was muted and coudnt do anything, good result on our part good job id day
If someone doesnt like ponies reasonablt I dont care
say*
berberborscing: I just ignore them.
I get the feeling that by the time the stream starts, I'll be able to draw these drawing from heart
Why JRP2234???
If they dont like the show for a good reason, so be it.
and thats how we do it down here on th'farm
or berberborscing, he got banned
ignore them bad-guys
and you're pointless stonewalling did nothing
he did?

And Tiara is the anti-bronies

MFW RainWithDashbows is now OP.
gosh darn!
what if Faust was trying to put that message in the video?
HIDE THE DRUGS.
Smoke weed every day
But the strange thing is, a lot of people like dubstep and funny and stuff.
if i had any id hide them
Ponies are just like that!
SuperBrony64 y u no listen to my stupid silly questions?
ow
Actually, here's hoping DWR smacks some sense into chat.
that ban spam
Would Far Cry 3 be considered as evidence for a drug case?
It seems middle school kids can't live with seeing a miniature equine doing all the things people do.
hide the drugs in lyra..........

Hmm.
I personally adapt to shit pretty fast
I dont have issues with change
yea id make sense that most of us do since we are the bronies
DashWithRainbows: Since when were you an OP?
[10:32:05] * SuperBrony64 sets mode: +o DashWithRainbows
Since 10 seconds ago.
Not long ago, ScootaChicken.
alright, im off to plqay Closure, hope things will clear by the time I get back :)
DashWithRainbows: Well, congrats at any rate.
Fallen Angels by Black Veil Brides http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzLPoDVrOM&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85
niec getting op i guess dude
I trust you to use this power to kick otakon in endlessly amusing ways.
I'm only helping out for a while, ScootaChicken.
To be honest my first experience with MLP was I was browing youtube and I saw an episode, I said why the hell not and tried it
*browsing
DashWithRainbows: Oh, so it's not permanent?
Nope.
my friend made me get on ponycraft(minecraft), thats how it all started..
When I heard Babs Seed, I thought it was "Bad Seed".
watched all first season in one go actually over the summer
me too lol
Thats the joke..
that'sthejoke.jpg
I became a brony somewhere during winter wrap up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECUrlnXCqk
Newfags, newfags everywhere.
i became a brony from apple.mov lol
So, Has anyone heard of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona?
when i first saw Babs seed, I thought it said Bad Apple that touhou fanbase song, actually pretty good
i think i have
of course we have
I became a Brony when I decide to watch the first episode when I was really bored.
and then a friendship bomb exploded in your chest
o wait, i remember after playing minecraft on a pony server, my friend made me watch ponies the anthology, it was great then i started on the first episode
now now ScootaChicken ya need to luv and tolaborate
running into bronies irl is always awesome
SpeccyRush: >tolaborate
I'll love and tolerate your face in a minute Speccy.
Speccy, I love you.
true, just like finding otakus is great too, imo
yes, i am an anime dude guy
I started around half way in season 2
>anime dude guy
I watched all of season 1 in one go
I like me some anime, too
yup thats me
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
guys
it was too good to not watch all of season 1 like that
wut
Jmo: How far into Death Note have you gotten?
When is the stream coming online???
ive seen all of it
never
just saiyan
Ep16 I think?
lol
When someone wants to stream, Doctor_Whooves.
Gave it a little break

Jmo: Ah fair enough.
I want to stream....
play 10 hour version of apple fwitter
id die
Why is baby applejack so fucking adorable?
oh god, of course thats a thing
so dashwithrainbows are you going to be streaming the vid later this morning?
this is always best stream so y no steam DX
the new ep i mean
HAHAHAHA
No, I'm not.
Because it's a pony we know, instead of a random baby in a carriage careening down a slope
I'm not a streamer, I'm just helping out for a while.
bleh
oki sounds good
so your saying we need to take baby applejack and shove her down a slope in a carriage
DoshWifRonbows is only here to kick people when necessary.

Touch? DashWithRainbows
I still have my sanity
Did someone just get banned? I swear, I need to pay more attention
and my sanity told me to not drink orange juice after midnight or i will be atatcked by robots
BlitzMcKrieg Donte did.
well the OUYA is about as big as a rubix cubne...
cube*
Which was a while ago.
oh

Damnit.
WHY!?
What does Zecora have to do with Spa Ponies? .-.
Spa pony, Pinkie and Zecora :3

idk i looked on the hub
?
when does live stream?
that happens on TV
!cd
Episode 10 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 0 days, 4 hours, 4 minutes, 34 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I dunno, but I like Zecora :3c
skipped to the 4th i think
that long
what does pinkie have to do with spa ponies
Maybe she knows relaxing oils :D
me too MadSurge
mine says 3 hours 48 minutes
cowvarkian: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
cowvarkian, do not question Pinkie
TV shows take a break for a month or two
mostly in the winter/ summer
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7bbbe1c66f2ad19eedc4e13524d395ce.png and finally two posters of this image and the previous Discordlicious image :D
do you guys watch LPS?
i dont
yes sometimes.
cowvarkian: Why would they show Episode 10 instead of 9 though?
yeah guys we get this one then it breaks till jan 19
DAWWW
NOOOOOOOOO
hello
KrazyNoobs: this is episode 9
when stream goes live?
Hi
Then why does everyone say its ep 10?
KrazyNoobs: because they're wrong
i havent even watched the latest one yet
possible typo
i don't know if we will even get a season finale or is it just a bunch of regular episode
And I'm done bragging! Feel free to throw bile at me :D
i think sadly this might be the last season
spitfirecolt: If so, R.I.P MLP:FiM
I think this is the actual episode 10 in the production but it is the 9th episode that aired. Episode 8 in the production order hasn't aired yet.
/me throws bile at MadSurge
i hope not
i need my pony fix every season
pfft

I mean think about it, Dashie got to go to the polace of her dreams, and i forget what else
i hope somepony in vegas asks that question about season 4

but TF2 is fun :)
:D
jaw drop
melt
DitzyDerpy15: that I was hallucinating
Luna in a santa costume? hmmmmm
Twilight beat my stairs with her spell
there wouldn't be a horse dressed as santa arriving at my house
Oh and, shove it kitties, pony is superior
how do you think keep calm and flutter on will turn out?
If you guys had the chance to live in equestria would you dop it?
Forbidden.
no
*do
mayyybe
Fluttershy as Santa? That would be pretty nice and kind and she would just be doing her element
i might
hm
Maybe.
if our world turns into a crapsack oone
im pulzed
if I was a pegasus or unicorn, then I might
^
or a Alicorn :DDD

:D
whew... another hour passes...
i was browsin Dota 2 vids and saw a vid about fluttershy singing an i was like err ill try it out
what is this dota 2
:O
why would you want rainbow terrible to be santa
that's a horrible idea
defense of the ancients 2
no
I'd seen it before, someone was showing off the smile song on his phone on the bus once, and it didnt annoy me as much as I thought it would
Y U NOT KNOW BOUT DOTA @ OR TEAM FORTRESS 2?????
anybody seen wreck it ralph?
it would probably just throw your presents outside or down the chimney or some shit
Hmm well I became a brony because of many people and things I was apart of kept referencing it and I saw the KYM video and then I found a 300 page topic for the show and read through it while watching the episodes from the start.
Dude, I still play warcraft 3

Okay, that wasn't such a bad animation. Even the sentry shooting the dove was in line with VALVe's more tongue-in-cheek look at tragedy.
Ever since those dancing videos, I've been waiting for Catgroove.
At the moment I'm these I have watched O_O
what do you expect
Love Him
Meeeeedic!!
AJJJ, I know bro, I know
NU NU NUM
NOOO HEAVY!
The short but violent life of a sentry. It's dangerous for a farmer to grow attached to his livestock. It's also dangerous for an Engineer to get attached to his sentries, especially his Mini-Sentries.
who did u kill medic???
Is there a particular time when pony videos start so I'll know for next time?
Because I can be in Australia
What?
POOTIS

I can see some foals have emerged.
