<FUS_RO_yay> youre from cajun country too?
"Jar Jar Binks" and "Funny Stuff" do not mix
woohoo!
;)
00,03MFW I liked this movie :/
"Jar Jar Binks" and "I WANT TO BLEACH MY EARS!!!" is more like it
11,012 or 3 were the best of the prequels.
When you see Jar Jar you want to have vISION BLEACH
I don't watch Star Wars much
11,01I think the pacing of the prequels was bad, though.
I have little opinion towards these movies
/me leaves
We saw it once, now we'll actually enjoy it
seeya [Al-

It's a trap!
<FUS_RO_yay> Hey, I have beignet cravings now.

11,01I hated those characters.
Earth is in the universe i just got destroyed
11,01Gunray should have died in Episode 1.
and all
were just watching the stream
i have lost control of my left arm
ow!
You see them get slashed a bit and that's it. That's....kind of odd for a sword that cuts through everything. Is everyone just barely scraping their enemies across the chest to kill them instead of trying to slash through them?
in corasant they have 300 jedi knights
cause der noobz
yes
:D
Either or.
becuase the writers got drunk and wrote shit during that
STFU anyway
13Petrified_Discord: it's that idiot ball everyone is clutching like crazy
Awwww
it'll be fine
CriticKittin: A lightsaber is just a concetrated light source and can burn through a lot of things, but not quickly. Its much easier to slash an enemy instead of getting slowed down by cutting a person in 2.
BEST MUSIC IN DA FAWKING WORLD
INCEPTION GOT NOTHIN ON THIS BITCH
11,01cratorkid: I don't mind.

Secondly, there is NO good reason for him to walk away with Anakin still alive when he knows he can't afford to let Anakin live if the universe is to be saved. What's with the rage-quits during fights? :P

everyfree radio sure hides the audiostream button well
i wanna eat a burgerwhile being eaten by that burger
^
This reminds me of the veg burger BBQ. It never happened.
:S:D
I've never had a vegburger, I bet they are horrible
Neither have I.
05Serenity; in america? probably
:>
05over here? they are good
Well, I guess I should sleep, got off work after a night shift. Have a good one guys
05home made? fuckign awesome
The megamix converted me to the herd
oh yea
Mine was mostly composed of beans and corn
I've sometimes considered going somewhere in Europe for holiday
haters
20% cooler
Can I link the welcome song?
lol
why would a vulcan wear a shirt that didn't cover her stomach? that is highly illogical
I was thinking of going to Italy for all the pizza and such
Because I like most italian foods
this remix was made very well
I'll eat anything except shillean food
Chillean
05sto pbeing populist
I'm not really a food eater
I pretty much can survive on 1 meal per day
05nah, but really you shouldnt bash otehr star trek branches jsut cause they arent tng
can = want to
LOL
this is made very well
get on everfree radio
here p.m the link
That's my only crtitizism on this show
Well the first two had the benefit of clasically trained actors heading the main roles
there ya go
both Shatner and Stewart did a lot of shakespeare
well, that escalated wuickly
dammit, q-key, why do you elude me?
top left
I've done the same for a long time
awwww yeah
i know where it is, but somehow it doesnt want to get hit
must be some sort of improbability field around it
Nowhere near as much as food, but still some :)
let the rape commence
um
or both
is it just me or does this song suck?
it's alright
i hate it lots
Star Trek
end already!!
If Ya gave me a chanch to see the enterprise I douldve guessed. Then again I asked.
Gamefreak just mute it
i don't care how you do it!
05Gamefreak324: jsut mute it you douche
yes
it's over and you put the volume all the way down
it is now gone
wtf!!
where does enterprise take place in the star trek timeline?
is this well after TNG?
angry face
it'll probably come up next
05this is about 2 or 3 lifetimes post the zefphram cochrane laucnh
05iirc
Gamefreak I can give you the link to the orginal version of the song
i'll wait
oh hey, wrong ping, againm
i like this one
you people stop using the "the"-prefix like crack
Zat Vas Delicious.
did he just eat a mask-full of maggots?
yummy
would you people eats a pot full of maggots if he offered it
Not many people know of it.
here it is
fruitflies?
:)
yea but
sorry
oh alright
hm...
hmmm
05and then
hi
05unkown
05id happily fill you in a bit
STORY TIME!
This episode or the series?
05this part of the series
go ahead. I'm interested. is enterprise the most current Star Trek?
05only got 4 season made though due to low ratings
05the lowe ratigns are kind of understandable casue the 2 first seasons were slow and quite boring
05but the latter 2 seasons were really nice
05use
05m*
05yes
yeah
05this is like only 2 or 3 lifetimes after the first warp launch
05now the prope originated from waht is known as the expanse
05and now the enterprise of the time is sent into the expanse to find the xindi
05this is the 3rd episode of season 3. the beginnign of the xindi chapter
that's not how you se a gun
you're fucked now
Brn!
05they were prototypes then
05heck the ship didnt get torpedoes untill liek 3 episodes ago
yeah, they had normal boring missiles for a long time
:3 I should be at work by now - I'm trying to track a co worker down
05hopefully you get to see soem more of the ship soon
05for isntance shield tech doesnt exist yet
they also dont use shields. they just polarize the armor palting of the hull
this can't be good
thats pretty cool. Is good that they didn't rush things techwise
05whic his probably why many fans hated it
05i mean come on
05whats? a star trek without sheield and phazurs? preposterous
maybe they just wanted more holo-deck episodes
i know I find it interesting
05same here
05but really
08,01wheee
08,01no?
08,01s/an/em/
the fans should be more open
only you :p
"it ruined my headcanon!"
Bass Cannon?
Some did
...now this i seriously dont get
:P
05also the first season was very slow and generalyl dull
08,01ah, still watching Enterprise?
05now and then they had to "decontaminate" by being practically nekkid in a blue lit room crasing themselves in
adorable Vulcan was adorable
05Saturn: yeah wanted to finish disc 1
i'm good
wat movie is this?
where are the Klingons by the way? Arn't they suppose to be the bogeymen of the federation at this time?
k
05there were actually alot of kingons early on
05but this takes place in the expans mostly
05expanse*
05in fact
05the very first episdoe has klingons
mindhive
05wrinkly foreheads
05atleast partially
But I thought they said the wrinkly forheads were from a plague, or they were like cloned...something klingons
like Krogans in mass effect
05for season 3 and 4 they changed the blue lit grease-up with the massages
Does Archer have some sort of disease?
05but meh
enterprise
05might be that too
05as for archer beign sick
You said that they had a blue gel thing and then switched to massages.
05oh
05that is archer
05the one getting the massage is tucker
quite the scabs he's got
05and as quaranten after away missions
05blue lit room and creasing
05greasing*
05it hurt the show more than it added
sort of seems like they just did it for fan-service
05yeah it was
they sure did
05to 80%
O.o
05well it kidna does fit
greta archer. you made him sad
05we have jsut recently gotten used to the "not alone in space" thing
05i wouldnt be suprised if the old millitant roots still sit in
05if that makes sense
05picard got me to try earl grey
05been drenkign it for breakfast quite often sicne then
05well
05wehn i wake up
05not neccesarily breakfast
:O
i'd buy that for a dollar
05TheMaster: streamed both seasons alteady >:3
damn. I missed it
05waiting for the 3rd now
Skilled xD
I can't wrap my brain around it
theres just too much that happens
05i actualyl read the books post the watchign the seasons
april
aaaanndd sprrroinnnnnng
:D
Jaqen H'gar is like 50x cooler in the tv series then in the books
i'm convinced he's actually a time lord assasin
hay gaaaaaauuuy
I'M BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me hugs everypony
slavery? in my star trek?
05nooo not the critters!
The poor wildlife D:
Didn't the NC reviewed this one? <---
05TheMaster: you mean in this?
05Dark92Enigma: if he did i havent seen it
05not yet
05they still have a shef!
05;D
05chef*
05in fact you can barely call it a federation yet
05more like a vulcan/human alliance
05with some bonuses
This is Star Trek: The Series.........not Star Trek: Generations, right?
how do replicators work anyway? Can the federation just mass produce any matter they want for less energy then the put out?
I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE SHIP!!
05this is not generations
oh, now i remember...........this is the series!
c'mno man
05hehe
05nice one
05oh also
05i didnt tell you
oh you read harry turtledove?
05the substance trellium D shields the ships in the expanse from the gravitonic distortions
inb4 he snorts it
05but the enterprise doesnt have that shielding yet
05hecne the inconvenience
05for isntance they were raided by pirates jsut casue they were knocked out by a distrotion
seeing low-tech star trek is pretty cool.
Time Lord crazy
What's up?
05seeign the tech on the "future" ships was awesome IMO
05but it works both ways
yup
05nah jsut joking
This looks interesting... oh damn it all... I have to go. Bye!
well I always thought the federation was really sort of like if you fused the air force with NASA
awwwww yeah
like they're not sure how military-ish they should be.
05right now they have a millitary troop onboard
05and there is some friction between them and the crew
Hey everypont
makes sense. It would be expensive to try and make two kinds of ships
unleash the power of the sun
05suddenly i am a pont
Lol!! xD
MIND CONTROLL!
05heck
she's gonna rip his heart out
05ship*
well... its not my kind of a show... but with queen its getting interessting :D
ooops
kablooey
05i didnt know that
05sounded quite interesting
05TheMaster: more or less
oooh :(
05yep
KISS her :D
oh -.-
inb4 she's a pheromone sprinkler
05they didnt start using it untill season 2 though in emergency situations due to high scepticism
oh my
it's time
I would be skeptical too. Knowing how it functions.
05aye
she sort of looks like river song
they once beamed someone up and he had leaves and branches stuck everywhere in him
they still have candles in the future
they still have candles now. theres no reason they'd go away
vulkan meditation
>trying to mind control a vulcan
goodluck
i knew she was evil
she needs to nerve pinch her
it's time to enter the prise
imagine how amazing that would be
05a shame it seems like an interesting show
05should i DL them or is it a waste of time
05adn yet here we are talkign about star treck :P
05kÄ*
star trekä. must be swedish
"we're running from evil robots. they're trying to find us"
05ive got that much :P
05hehe ^_^
do the airlock trick!
I saw episodes where an entire planet was themed on 1930s gangster america
which was awesome by the way
05a projectile weapon would work against those guys rather easely
05id keep a revolver with me
05actually yes he did
these guys are pretty well equiped
05well they are the more millitant and agressive xindi
HEY EVERYPONY! :)
hello every pony
05dat gland
its a Pinkie pie Gland
shouldnt they also analyze the suit?
to much sugar
:3
05well i got a little while logner
051 more EP shouldtn harm
FOUND IT
please proceed
NO MORE BHG
YESSS

YES
everfree is playing it
awesome
cone!?!
cone
the cone of doom
05there are more to these than a bio scan can tell
the hells happening did they encounter face huggers
OH
Ello there everypony.
she mad
Close enough, but it's not KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Or CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
okay. I've stayed away from the topic long enough. I've been very patient these last few months. But is there any word on season 3?
*delayed
05more than that
05we acnt say here
Season 3 spoilers are a bannable offense
it shall never come
05you say only 13, i say "yay 13 more!"
even if they're already at 18+ hours of content
@Wreck = I don't mean that as a bad thing. I actually wouldn't mind seeing them scale it back
Dat Wreck
It can't be that expensive to produce episodes
why are they collecting asteroids
and the VAs can't cost that much
hello everyone
05casue they need the base ore to make trelliuum D
stupid all-constant and inescapeable force of the universe!
Honestly if Season 3 goes out as strong as Season 2 more or less, I'm fine with it being the last season. I've seen way too many cartoons that I have loved more that would have killed for a 65 episode run
oh look, they have a redshirt witht hem
I don't think there were redshirts in Enterprise
all you have to do is stop watching
helps to avoid being murdered
the only thing that annoys me on this series is the perverse amount of bloom
05i dont get it
it was worst in the first season
vulkan zombies. greta
*great
I guess the only way to not die is to get a important position in the ships hierarchy
05red-shirt is doing well
HIYA everypony
is that pfhase gun set on stun?
he broke the system!
He won't die. He's a helmsman
05space zombies and pirates
where's smas arn when you need her
they have tickle, they just never mention it
05and the limb setting
all played by ponies.
05no it would be solved it tpol had let them use kill isntead of stun
05nope not me
they'd look like this http://cdn.walyou.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/07/Spock-Pony-e1341908055352.jpg
lol
i refuse to click on that
costs like 600 bucks
Huh. THey really are ninjas
05hes fucking with otu
it costs 600 intenret dollars
05you*
lol k
these guys look like they are froma vault
uh oh. She let her emotions get out of control
05hehe
many the entire ship just went into pon-far or something
maybe*
05mhm
website is offline? wtf?
i hit retry now it works
he did nothing
why do they store anti-matter its fucking dangerous if you touch it youll doom the whole universe XD
05becasue it powers the engines
05if it can explode
breathes*
^_^
05hai rain :D
how are you? ^_^
*oxygen
if i didnt breathe i would die
gas is the one very flamable
learn how to breathe something less flamable
Heat
05oxygen, fuel, heat
if its very flamable why do you breathe it? we cannot survive without air if we didnt need to breathe we wouldent have a fucking nose
05so you heart would stop
This conversation is making me chuckle.
21% my bad
05its only 7% uhm
05whatever you englis hspeakers call it
and without the nitrogen plants wouldn't grow
05it fuels the engines
^
typically dangerous things make for good fuel
05becasue it fuels his body
Anti-matter is best matter
05partially
because of how much energy is stored inside. energy, when uncontrolled, can lead to cool explosions
*nerd*
antimatter makes a looooooot of energy when it is mixed with matter in a safe environment
05Dark92Enigma: well its still a fuel
05so you got me on a technicallity
if i remmeber correctly, they use deuterium and anti hydrogen
safe, inert things don't usually make a lot of energy when you burn them unfortunately.
They made coal powered ships after all
we could make a hamster poweredcar
but the stored hydrocarbons in coal arn't nearly as good as oil/gasoline
i hope he comes on
the camera sure did
he PMed me but i was on the little colts room
his face when
I think its movie night
Xindi!
t'pol be trippin
naw, they're just vulkan zombies
fo reals
its BMN far in the future
05fuck me i want another episode
i dont mind
was that the last one?
NEXT
I always thought Enterprise was a tad bit underrated
05ohai
05this episode is meh
we know xD
It took 2 seasons for it to get good but when it was good, it was very good.
Naw hes painting rarity... we all know that.
how cool would that be?
anti-matter soon*
Zanon:is raritys skin purple?
05too bad people consider it a weapon
which is cool too
r
fusion bombs are already ridiculous
now ITER is getting built
they've observed anti-matter I believe.
bullets are for pussy anti matter ftw XD
There is always a biggerfish, or in this case a bigger weapon
HWG does not agree.
HWG likes bullet
bullets are good but anti matter is best bullet that isnt really a bullet :3
oh silly religious people
dumb people. dumb people everywhere
i'm glad hawkings turned out to be right
earth?
are you planning on living for hundreds of billions of years?
05earth is a fluke
05but that doesnt mean we should find otehr flukes
05shouldnt*
We should make the other flukes
no

05no allcaps
Europa - the futuristic Europe.
05there is no federation yet

but they are not equivelant
if it was europa it wouldent be on the fucking news
it happens to be close
relatively close
Allo everypony.
guys they werent talking about europa
Ooh, Enterprise.
Enterprise takes place long before the founding of the federation
Hey everypony, Pluto says Hi
then thats cool too
He is after her booty

I joined on a Star Trek episode/10
00,10dvds eh?
05mhmmm
OK, brb......gotta go to my house......
but the abrams movies set them at the very beginning
with the least technology. The enterprise got wrekced by a mining ship
Which is why I want to go back to the future
best intro ever
I got nothin' else. d:
I don't know...the intro looks like the weakest of the franchise...

05i have the DVD boxes of those aswell
05heck i have the VHS collection of voyager
05nope
00,10lol vhs
Only the good ones? :D
did Wrath of Khan ever get picked as a movie night?
because that is easily one of the best movies i've ever seen, even outside of star trek
05only TNG, voyager, DS9, and this one for the series. but i own all the movies
00,10no trek has ever been voted or picked
00,10so do I
The only movies worth watching in my opinion is Wrath of Khan, FIrst Contact, and 2009
00,10I used it to record pony
Needs more Voyager.
Khaaaan!
05first contact is my favorite star trek movie
^
05even if people disliked it
00,10first contact was good
:D
I only seen some Star Trek movie, and I'll tell you.
I'm very tempted to linkt ot he plinkett reviews
00,10Voyager needed a movie
I like that one.
05never owned the sets but i used to have some VHS tapes with episodes recorded on them
Voyager ended well imo.
05true
The only Star Trek finale that sucked I thought was sadly the finale to Enterprise
...Altough the movie was...disapointing, there's not a lot of action (damn you Enterprise scene.), the characters looked sort of bland, etc.
00,10oh this is enterprise after they got the Makos.
05you mean TNG or this one?
This series
The TNG finale was excellent
05well it ended in theory 3 seasons too fast

DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
p-p-p-p-p-planet busted
well that was...slightly disturbing to watch
00,10this intro is faster then I recall
05yeah after the 2nd season they made the itnro "hip"
05thoguh i personally preffered the season 1 intro
00,10guess they never changed it when I watched it on tv
Thing is if you know anything about Star Trek prior to this series it's not a particularly credible threat.
for the "cewl" kidz?
hai everypony, how you doing? :$
never really watched Star Trek before
05actually a good episode
all i know is KAHN
00,10I am disapointed they never once did any calback humor to Quantium Leap
T'pol with long hair... that is my fetish :3
i loved quantium leap
lol, star trek?
that didnt feel good
05sure ill have some
20 degrees at warp speed?
05neat
05well technically there is no "motioN" during warp speed
if not tear the ship apart
05not in the same matter
00,10not much of a strcutral support if it just falls off
05or am i wrong?
right
05well never bothered lookign it up
05please explain
dem scanners
wtf
Inb4 he's given them that before.
05so while turnign 20 degrees could effect the destination os stabilities
i watched some 2005 Dr.Who lately
fusion drive with Anit-mater and matter colent
00,10So basicly it gave him altimsers
05not in that matter atleast
i need to find the older version though
He needs to relax more.
hai :3
05Sumica: aye
05was i right or wrong?
05probably a language failiure on my part
That's great to hear! ^ ^
that's good
lol
whats going on? (ihave no idea
dem aliens
00,10fail crewman
That's great!
05killed by liberty
a STICK ?
dem enterprise :D
05sumica
00,10only disabled?
05we should write that down
05that would be a viable tactic
00,10raming?
00,10aye
00,10we kinda did that the other night
00,10I used the tail harpoon and draged one enemy in to another
00,10we already lost the match but we got 2 kills
how about they switched most of their power to the engine and warp generator thingy
are you talking about BF3?
>.>
HAHAHA BF3.
bye bye everypony
be back later
00,10they need both of those pylon things to make a stable warp field
humans go bye bye
wh cant i hold all these feels
00,10with out it the buble would hae parts of the ship movie at diffrent speeds.
i missed the first half of this episode, whats going on?
05they are called gondola
05;O
05well
hence why they could still high 1.7 with only one necelle
05the term higher speeds doesnt really apply to warp
Live long and prosper.
thing
05not really speed
Warp 9.975. Voyager's average cruising speed, if I recall.
00,10they cant hold the speed for long
05hehe
05did we ever get to know more about warp 10 beyond the TNG episode?
00,10Voyager had it
though they do create 2 alternative forms, the quantum slipstream, and the delta-flyers (cant remember the name) one which hits warp 10
00,10but then voyager puled out transwarp
05well yeah
and then goes all creepy looking
00,10STO takes place after Voyager
Quantum slipstream was in Voyager.
boo
05been a while since i viewed all of voyager
05what was that about?
i'd have to laod it up to check, but yeah. its after anything thats been shown on tvb
lol
05yeah i recall something simmilar
^
05no
05all episodes are 40 minutes
wow dat is a long episodes
wow i just realized movie night is on my Birthday
05thanks for the refresher
we completely ignored the protocol :P
Oh
05this is S3EP8
thanks
:P
05out of 224
0524*
S3EP224. That's a long season.
around the sun?
time for time travel
warpdrive + sun slingshot = time travel
this isn't a voyage home
05dat goatee is awesome
dem lazors
Man they're pretty aggressive.
Phasors
00,10She tells him every day and shows him once every 7 years
PEW PEW PEW time
she has pointy ears
05dat pon far reference
00,10heh
/me cant handle that guy's chin...
/me just wants to pick that little thing off
00,10rage
05rain doesnt like goatees? :o
05ah
his chin has that weird little thing and alsfnv;asdnc I just want to pick at it ><
>_>
00,10where these eps are good, I just never liked the it never happend things
/me at least tried
A for effort Rain.
WAIT
heres the thing, if they already removed some of the parasites
00,10this is like the "year of hell" ep of voyager
00,10yeah
05oh now i get it
I hated those too.
i always feel bad for the crew in those eps
dat leadership
KAHN! is that coming up soon
they really DONT like that right necelle
thats the same one they lost earlier
05aye
OH SHIT :O
DED
Rain: A for effort, is all, don't mind me i'm just a nerd
if i recall its also the one voyagers takes alot of damage to
:O
Exacta.
omg
Nooooooooooo!!
SHOOT THEM
well that can't be good
Well, looks like the voyager is aout to get molested and destroyed
wow people, its been too long
Not sure about the molested bit, buy mrh
05that isnt the voyager
05,,,
05...
ded
and seperation capabilities
do they do learn
but a LONG time from now
And I can hardly type rom this proportional angle
00,10back up bridges. are pointless if the primary crew just got spaced
05i dont blame ya
And now the damage report machine is damaged.
abandon ship?
00,10put primary bridge in the center of the hull and you dont have the problem of it ggeting cut open
buyt then how do you get the "hole in the bridge ramming speed" shots
^
like where janeway destroys the time ship
00,10this is just a hey we can put clips of every one dieing in the advertisment and realy get alot of people watching
everyone else takes 1 shot to die
05USS Defiant is best federation vessel
archer takes 3
nuuuuu
He ded
05hehe
WHATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me back in time...
boom
inb4 he remembers the future
wtf just happened?
Before newcomers get up in arms, It was not all just a dream
00,10TV trope: it was all just a dream
00,10was it?
lol
they destroyed something that doesn't follow the rules of time
05well i was first reffereing the DS9 one
YOWCH
The Parasites were displaced in time. Archer finished the removal procedure in the future, which destroyed them in the past, meaning the timeline has now diverged
ello
well that episode MADE NO SENSE
^
made sense to me :)
do you get them

which REALLY needs a touch up
Hey look, it's me.
HAI ME
Trigun was one of those series that was awesome/funny/awesome/repeat
best opening
the age shows in the animation greatly
Hi everypony
EVER
Let the OLD relics of masterpieces of the past BE
Oh
That's fine then :P
No 3D though please
is this ep.. 5(?)
I'm not sure
yup
00,10I dont know I would like to see trigun come out like redline
:D
whats a yar?
that's a lot of graves
not this episode, the next one is kickass (I think) the one with the brothers
the thing that bugs me about Trigun is the...inherent goofiness of alot of the "enemies".
not her again
wow how old is this anime?
looks old
hai, i'm back :)
