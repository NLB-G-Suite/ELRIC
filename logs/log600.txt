Hey bronies My dad's going to london this week

Whos doing the commentary?
11,01That's the "Ask" button.
11,01In Tumblr.
Shooeie Rifftrax
Have 20 billion dollars, throw together some CG special effects, then at the last minute realize you need to put some words in it
<FUS_RO_yay> youre from cajun country too?
linsett: Hell yeah.
Shooeie Rifftrax, aka the MST3K guys
"Jar Jar Binks" and "Funny Stuff" do not mix
woohoo!
;)
linsett: Born and still being raised.
00,03MFW I liked this movie :/
"Jar Jar Binks" and "I WANT TO BLEACH MY EARS!!!" is more like it
<FUS_RO_yay> yeah same here. u in the big easy?
Scoot-Scootaloo: do you like it better than the OT?
11,012 or 3 were the best of the prequels.
00,03AWW Hell naw!
When you see Jar Jar you want to have vISION BLEACH
I don't watch Star Wars much
Nittany_Discord: Agreed
11,01I think the pacing of the prequels was bad, though.
Scoot-Scootaloo: okay good....i dont have to murder you now
I have little opinion towards these movies
linsett: I might be here, but im an inside person so i dont know what that means, lol. I live in Youngsville,
/me leaves
We saw it once, now we'll actually enjoy it
seeya [Al-
hmm
<FUS_RO_yay> I meant New Orleans XD
11,011 and 2 were slow, so they had to speed up 3 so they could get the end of 3 to match 4.
linsett: Ah, the other Sin City.
Nittany_Discord: Third in the start has one heck of a good battle scene
<FUS_RO_yay> Lol, yes
11,01They could have introduced the clone army in 1.
lol smurf powerd
11,01Instead of farting around on Naboo.
linsett: I do like going there every now and then.
<FUS_RO_yay> I'm in Covington
linsett: Ah, what are you doing up there?
OH! Nevermind! My family's watching the original MST3k
See ya!
Nittany_Discord: WHy do you think George started Star Wars with the 4th episodes?
*episode
<FUS_RO_yay> I live there, duh
linsett: I thought you just said your from New Orleans -_-
*books
oh
:o Shizustream and Riff? :D
CriticKitten eeyup
<FUS_RO_yay> I didn't say that I only asked you that because New Orleans is well known
Shizu stream is best stream :3
XD
11,01Apparently, there's air?
<FUS_RO_yay> like think louisiana most think new orleans
how is there lightning is space?
11,01Something pushed that droid off.
13they're in the upper atmosphere
ah
Force lightning?
linsett: I thought most people think of food.
I get it now
11,01Makes sense Shizuka.
13and going pretty fast, so the very little air that would be up there is just enough to provide resistance and conduct splosions
<FUS_RO_yay> That too
Shizuka is best logic scientist
I always loved that droid that made the dying sound
linsett: mmmmm I want some gumbo now, thanks a lot. -_o
It's a trap!
<FUS_RO_yay> Hey, I have beignet cravings now.
oh look, big ugly and stupid in the . . . metal?
Droid CARS
I can't say flesh
cuz he doesn't have much, if any
11,01Droids have crap reaction times.
linsett: Lol Cafe Du Monne or however you spell it.
Nittany_Discord: ikr?
11,01And crap attention spans.
basically, droids are crap
got it
hey Nittany_Discord i followed your tumblr
<FUS_RO_yay> Cafe du Monde and yes
11,01Thanks Pudge
can you follow if you don't have tumblr?
linsett: Theer quality has decreased over the years though
their*
11,01Canadian_Brony: No.
11,01You have to create an account.
11,01You don't have to use it.

00,03MFW I have a Twitter :'(
eww twitter
<FUS_RO_yay> Last time I was there was like a year ago
Hehe. Twitter.
11,01I originally created a Tumblr account just to follow other tumblrs and contact people for interviews.
/me 13nuzzles canary canary~<3
time to start scribbling random notes on an index card and lost it
linsett: I havent been to New Orleans in a year.
same here i just created one to follow others
I dont understnad social media
<FUS_RO_yay> I wouldn't know about the restaurants decreasing quality
Its a trap
This level was soooooooo easy in the lego video game
Scoot-Scootaloo atleast they don't hack your account without telling you and say it was a "White-hat hacker"
^ reason why I closed my account
Easy because it was the first Episode III stage I guess
"I want a muffin."
linsett: Tourists couldnt tell. They just wanna eat some and say it was delicious because they can.
ROFL
/me 11,01hugs LadyCanary
/me is hugged.
O
MUFFINS!!
LadyCanary I would throw a muffin at you, but I left them on the moon. Sorry.
<FUS_RO_yay> I think the beignets are fine, only thing is that the place is severely understaffed.
11,01Lol.
11,01Nom nom Jedi Chow.
linsett: Well, its a big area, almost always overflowing with customers, its almost impossible to be correctly staffed.
". . . and now your dead. The end."
irs lol
can't remember where I heard that
"He's due for a sequel."
<FUS_RO_yay> You're right about that, but still, the beignets still get people to keep on coming back, so how exactly is the restaurant declined?
*declining]
11,01XD
Dat Wilhelm
Wilhelm
was that the Wilhelm Scream? Seriously?
linsett: I just think the quality of the food itself has decreased.
I'm impressed
linsett: Still good though.
Wait , why is a ship falling in space ?
<FUS_RO_yay> Yeah it's still good in my book as well
Hey everypony! :)

We never get any new books. If I'm going to read something, I dont' want it to be 50+ years old. I want to learn English, not History!
why are they hating this movie sooooo much?
Jar Jar is alove
Xaiden|Okari: thats what they do
alive
Xaiden|Okari: they dont have any other humor
lol
But why???
Xaiden|Okari: because non-insult humor is a lot harder
Its nothing more than fillers
I'm rather neutral about the Star Wars series.
xD
So was I before i saw the prequels
XD
lol
I feel like poking fun at the prequels is fine. It's when people bitch insessantly that it gets a bit much :P
imo sw3 was as great as the originals
minues the high ground
/me just lol'd at that singing line
well guys, i'm gonna get outta here so i can pass out on a bed
Puppet yoda was better than CGI
bye BronyInstrumental
g'night BronyInstrumental
G'night brony
night
too lazy to spell out your name
Xaiden|Okari: According to canon: Jar-Jar realizes his role in the Sith takeover and actually learns to shut the hell up. The Emperor recognizes that thanks to Jar-Jar, he was easily able to take control. Therefore, Palpatine gives Jar-Jar a luxurious life until, presumably, either/both dies.
one of the good things about this movie was that for once love wasnt the ultimate good, and its demonstrated how love can be just as evil as hate and such
brb. My flank is killing me
That was bad. XD
Sabershy: Doesn't he say "Wesa free" at the end of the new "Return of the Jedi"?
No it was fear
....they added him to Return?
._.
Fear caused annie to do all these bad things
CriticKitten: Eeyup
....
Who's doing the commentary?
Azuredragon Rifftrax
they do movie commentaries
/me raises his paws into the sky and gives a Spoony-esque "BETRAAAAAAAAYAL" scream.
CriticKitten: This means that Jar Jar gets the last line in the series. Think about that. :|
Dat ghost
11,01XD
Shooeie: fear caused by love
LMAO
Mace Windu should i said that
Shooeie: it was his unobjective love towards padme above anything else
11,01You're still a n00b, Annie.
If you count there is only 3 black people in all of star wars
Love how they keep giving him more typical Samuel Jackson dialogue. XD
Why?
it's funny
Ummmm. HELLO EVERYPONY! and how long was I playing TF2? O_O
lol
I'm actually somewhat curious, why do they need the Wookies?
hi Ponies47. Not sure
00,02i just completed qwop
Peace or some shit
good night everypony
all dem swears
00,02i jumped 0.3 meters

Sabershy: He's in the new "re-edited" version. There are at least three versions of RoTJ
Cya Pudge

Canadian_Brony: It was a pretty long time O_O
CriticKitten: Slaves? >_>
Night Pudge
I can't walk in QWOP
hoi Ponies47
Sabershy: This is the Republic, not the Empire. So the slave excuse doesn't fly.
Bye Pudge. :)
Hey twilight_sprinkle

Treason is fine during war. *nod*

How did annie get that scar?
oh my, character and story development, the horror

Phase4 I can't even get to that without f*cking it up
Keeps callin me shaft, LOL
ROFL
Where did this prophecy come from, incidentally?
The reason this feels so dull is because this scene, like many others, is done in shot-reverse-shot. Bluescreen is a double-edged sword :P
00,03Im off too. Night y;all!

"Off, it pisses me."
I think I missed it

Bronysith: its your favourite movie
CriticKitten: My favorite is still "penis-headed ghost of Hamlet's father" XD
I'm losing it, this is funniest one I have seen from these guys XD
/me cocks a revolver next to superretroworld s head
superretroworld: you want to reword that?
13best line here
ohai Bronysith
What? XD
which one?
CriticKitten: Some research shows that Wookies were pretty just much like humans: beaing capable of flight, trade, and has the ability to be able to use the force.
which is best line?
13coming
wth are they watching
*poker face*
Sabershy: Along with dozens of other alien races.
Bronysith: i thought you liked star wars?
They had no real "purpose".
superretroworld: this isnt star wars
not sure if that was the line . . .
Sabershy: Why do they specifically need the Wookies?
13here
LOL

Shizuka I don't get it
Bronysith: oh its rifftrax, nevermind
go ahead, facehoof
Xaiden|Okari: should still work
twilight_sprinkle: Well it's just Java's not loading
superretroworld: episode 1-3 is not star wars
HA
13as in
13what mst3k does
CriticKitten: Who knows? After the Sith took over, the Wookies continually fought against Palpatine, finally angering him into making the whole race as "slaves"
Shizuka oh
twilight_sprinkle: but that might just be because I have a bad computer
Bronysith: ik, i thought since you were a big fan of star wars you liked all of them
im a libertarian
He's a fan of the originals
Xaiden|Okari: i just checked, it worked
superretroworld: um...a big fan of star wars hates the prequels...
I'm sorry, but I'm not laughing. I should lay off the caffeine . . .
Xaiden|Okari: didnt work on a dif pc for me btw
twilight_sprinkle: I guess it doesn't work on G-Chroome
Moo
Bronysith: yeah good point
Xaiden|Okari: im using chrome
Chroome?
CHROOOOOME

Lolz
Chroooome is best internet browser
Amen.
better than IE
hello ppl
hi HellsFortune
Agree'd,
Pfft. OPERA is better than IE XD
/me is curious if this is canon or if this is just supposed to be Palpatine being a lying shit.
You read my mind Petrified_Discord.
hmm... what am i watching ? ;o
i wonder if the new IE is as good as they advertise :P
the only use I see in IE is downloading a new browser
lol
Dryer lint? XD
HellsFortune Star Wars III with Rifftrax
hm.. ok :)
Er, that's not actually ironic
Suddenly Avatar.
Palpatine on Tape
the soundtrack for this movie was amazing in my opinion
/me slaps twilight_sparkle
Nope. :)
Commentary seems to make this bearable
Just listen to Alex Clare, the music to their new ads, and smile.
Alpha, that's their job, making terrible movies fun to watch
Survivor is stupid. Some people quit their jobs to stay on the show. Imagine how that would look on your resume.

11,01And hi Ponies47!
11,01XD
Xaiden|Okari: well i would suggest you rewatch it, its a good opportunity to experience
[Alpha] it was a TV show that these guys doing the commentary used to do. Look it up on YouTube.
why not electrostatic force, or gravitation force
I would grab a Flachette Shotgun on Engineer and hop in a tank. Mowin' em down!
Nittany_Discord: Sorry to hear that. Anything I can do to help?
Okay I shall do that later
OF THE FUTURE
11,01Sabershy: I'll be fine. Thanks for the offer.
11,01There's not much you can do.
Oh incase any of you don't know already. I have made a new Skype "Ponies47" is my username. Feal free to add me. But I can't do any calls yet. I still don't have a mic and webcam. Atleast not yet :P

Nittany_Discord I would throw a muffin at you if I didn't leave them all on the moon.
Lol?
Anakin's mad because he doesn't have his cutie mark yet. :D
The script tells me I should have more....
Nittany_Discord: Alright then... :(
Petrified_Discord: :D
Petrified_Discord: THATS THE SOLUTION!! GET THAT MAN THE CMC!!!!!!!!!

Xaiden|Okari: Cutie Mark Crusader Sith Lords! YAY! :D
awwwwwww yeah
/me 11,01hugs Sabershy. The only help I need is financial, and I need that a lot, but I can't use people for money.
/me accepts the hug.
lmao
Haha, we are in the same boat then. Just got pay. 600 goes to rent, so that leaves me with 100 left. Which I just spent on food and gas...
wtf someones talking

hey Xaiden|Okari
hello
Sheep. I'm thinking of Endhiran.
Ughh, no I"M QUOTING THE MOVIE! XD
Lol :D
They failed the QTE
Uh, why?
Man Rifftrax is having ALOT Of fun in this one :D
id rather dance :D
use "Quotes" for quotes
You have hundreds of droids there, he can't possibly outgun them all.
Just let them attack you idiot.
Spiny hands, me jelly
Dance!
dance!
CriticKitten IKR?
CriticKitten: what do you think
11,01XD
Xaiden|Okari: me too
6_9
ONE HAND GONE
lol
wuwuwuwwuwuwub
TWO HANDS GONE
CriticKitten: its because he has the opportunity to kill himself, and even if he fails, they kill him.
sound of a lightsaber spinning
lol
Clone troopers
dafuq
CriticKitten: its called arrogance and revenge.
The general is pretty lame in the movie :(
Yeah...
it's Rifftrax
Spider
but essentially, yeah
seems legit
11,01Lol.
i think in the time it too for him to board and activate that thing, he could have killed him
twilight_sprinkle: I think Ep2 established that a large enough swarm of droids can kill even a squad of Jedi. This is ONE Jedi. He has a chance to kill one of the lead generals without much effort or loss, then he could spend his time hacking through the entire incoming fleet himself.
So for a "general", Grevious is showing that he's kind of an idiot.
Dafuq
11,01XD
Grevious IS an idiot
Dat lipgloss
random lightsaber
CriticKitten: i just explained it... and sith generals dont participate in battles they dont have to
Third life
hur hur
Yep who thinks grevious is an idiot say I
I
twilight_sprinkle: just like generals IRL
I
"Aye"
:|
plot
CriticKitten: Obi-Wan is very special. You can't kill her. IT WILL CREATE A TIME PARADOX!
*him
pony_1865: I
lmao her
I'm trying so hard not to make a wisecrack
Grevious is my favorite jedi, though he IS an idiot
lol her.
heyo Jmo4267
11,01XD
/me 11,01engages
twilight_sprinkle: And I just said that was a bad excuse. He's the leader of the Separatist army right now. He can't afford to risk losing a fight to Obi-Wan, and doesn't need to when all those droids could have killed him straight up. :P
Grevious isn't a jedi......
I just got that joke Nittany_Discord
Palpatine is my favorite Jedi
almost did a spittake
Lol :D
STFU
they took down my facebook page XD
ROFL
XD
lol
CriticKitten: [07:35:18] CriticKitten: its called arrogance and revenge.
nude steam bath
Oh god
lol i love these things XS
twilight_sprinkle: And he gets his revenge by letting the droids gun him down. >_>
*XD
CriticKitten: thats not as satisfying...
GNIGHT EVERYPONY, as always, may the force be with you all and be sure to pierce the heavens with your drill!
nude steam bath is best . . . buck it, I'm not sayin' it
CriticKitten: seeing as how he thought he could do that even if he loses
twilight_sprinkle: Who cares? He's the last leader left in an army that is losing the war!
g'night Bronysith
night Bronysith !
Palpatines the sith lord? DIDNT SEE THAT COMING? :P
night Bronysith
Uncle Evil
lol
kill him!
twilight_sprinkle: He's basically just said "well the war isn't as important as me killing one single Jedi", making him officially the worst general ever.
^
CriticKitten: name me a single villain who immediately killed the main hero
Petrified_Discord: LOL
kill him now!
A porn of the jedi? :D
whos commenting
hi ancientblood. Rifftrax
DO IT!!
:D
;)
KILL HIM!!
twilight_sprinkle: Wat? He's trying to kill him right now!
CriticKitten: .......
twilight_sprinkle: He just chose the STUPID way to do it.
Herro
Night Bronysith
wow lol
someone's probably wrote a FiC about Palpatine and Annie doin it
just sayin
:P
i can probably find it
Didn't need to imagine that.
CriticKitten: name a single villain who didnt toy with the protagonist instead of just shooting him
Buytoast: PLEASE DONT
i heard disturbing noises
Wawawawawa
i heard dubstep XD
Wuwuwuwuwuwuwuuwuwub
twilight_sprinkle: Oh so *now* it's okay for the movie to resort to a cliche that you'd bitch about in any other movie. :P
is it just me or is the movie laggier then hell
twilight_sprinkle: Darth Maul?
ancientblood: Just you
ancientblood: try refreshing, its fine on my end
Sabershy: quigon had no purpose
yeah, yeah i found one
thanks google
KICK
Y U NO USE FORCE?
Yeah, it was smart for you to take the Jedi on singlehandedly, wasn't it, Grievous?
Xaiden|Okari: IRK
11,01XD
GREVIOUS SMASH! :[
*IKR
LOL
CriticKitten: lol, and now apparently this is bad for you, even tho bane in your precious batman movie couldve killed batman immediately as well
No need to use that ARMY OF DROIDS YOU HAD SURROUNDING HIM, just do it yourself
Sure kick the robot, smart
CriticKitten eeyup
Twilight_sprinkle: You just said Liam Neeson has no purpoe...
lmao
ded
Killed...by, a gun
ignore the FORCE POWERS YOU'VE SPENT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE LEARNING
That was easy, now how did he live through a whole goddamn cartoon series?
twilight_sprinkle: Yes, and he should have.
Obi-wan, y u no make heartburn joke?
Xaiden|Okari: hahaha XD
lol
dat funny death arrangement
CriticKitten: its in every movie, and the reason for it is villain arrogance
I thought Jedis didn't use guns?
twilight_sprinkle: But sorry, TDKR is still a better film, so your troll analogy fails. :P
I need to do stand up comedy... :P
[Alpha] they don't
that wasn't a gun *AJ pokerface*
What the fack? Star Wars?
theres two people commentating its riffrax and....
twilight_sprinkle: And my reply to that is "he's a shitty general then".
"We must move quickly. Walk slowly beside me."
MACE WINDU IS TEH BEST!
"Now stop."
master bug eyed rasta fish XD
twilight_sprinkle: You seem confused. I don't care about the cliche. I'm pointing out that resorting to the cliche at this point in the movie makes him a bad general by default. :p
lol
Wow, a squad of jedi CONVIENTLY IN A SHIP TO GO TO THE CHANCELLORS PALACE!!! HOW CONVIENENT!!
back
What are we atching
lmao
Aaand Padme wins the gold in competetive sitting :D
:O
lol
Petrified_Discord: hahahahaha
this was so unneeded
Moo :3
XD
CriticKitten: which means that prety much every villain in history is also a bad villain
lol
I love combos <3
COOOOOOOOOMBBOOOOOOOOOO!!!
/me likes combos
13i think i miss the combos reference
AN ORGY OF DICK TOWERS
lego :)
13obviously a snack
LEGO STAR WARS FAWK YES
Legos > Star Wars
Xaiden|Okari: haha
I like lego
/me 11,01combos Shizuka
lol
twilight_sprinkle: Not every villain. But I'm glad you're finally admitting that this is a mediocre film by pointing out that it, like all other average films, resorts to tired action cliches.
Lego starwars was a fun game
LOL
ROFL
why is he censored
i am the senate
This scene, I'm not going to lie, gave me fawking nightmares. That's what I get for watching this when I was 6
hahahaha XD
I think they handled this scene poorly.
13so... those three jedis...
And all the Jedi get there asses handed to them
13they were useful..
CriticKitten: lol dont start twisting my words, i never said its a bad movie. to the contrary, that one cliche changes nothing since pretty much every movie does it
13and you know what
Lego Star Wars, the fun way to do the prequels and Clone Wars
Shizuka: indeed
those jedi were scrubs
dem jedi suck
Shizuka they were?
13i'm sure somewhere they have like their entire family tree mapped and extensive novels about their history
"Let me hold my lightsaber over my head so you can stab me in the chest!" :D
WHERES THE USE OF THE FAWKING FORCE
DAT STARE
I want popcorn
lol, probably
twilight_sprinkle: You're arguing in favor of the cliche by saying "It's in every other movie". Which actually helps reinforce my argument that this is an average movie.
Anikrap
crap*
So yes, you ARE agreeing with me. :P
lol
explaining how to make food is more exciting then this movie XD
13i love this bit so much
CriticKitten: lol then so is your precious batman movie
Shizuka: Do you want me to give you the specific web links to their history? :)
Shizuka: Same, fawking awesome
DAT KICK
Lore wise it makes sense that mace windu can counter darth sidious since mace has learned most known fighting styles
brb
13their bit in matrix reloaded about having bacon in the booth is almost as good
twilight_sprinkle: You realize I've stopped paying attention to your trolling already right? If you can't produce a good argument then don't start one. ;D
XD
why did the glass shatter? The lightsaber should have cut a hole in it
CUT
NO NOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
not SHATTER
lmao
13pressurized i assume
Anicra : hey guys hows it going
dat no
hes not properly grounded XD
13more pressure inside than out
13for some reason
11,01Lol.
And like I said when this aired the other day, this would've been a much more effective battle sequence if Palpatine was fighting all four of the Jedi at the same time.
Anakin is racist
CriticKitten: that contains no information. you say this movie is medioacre because it uses a cliche every other movie does, but if your batman movie does it, its ok
back
By the power of greyskull, I HAVE THE POWAAAAAAAAA
Darth Syphillis!!!!
CriticKitten: double standards.
Instead of just killing three of them in seconds.
lmao darth syphillis XD

Xaiden|Okari: you are making me laugh so much, thanks XD
ded
11,01Lol.
twilight_sprinkle: I repeat: if you can't make a good argument, don't start one. Right now your primary argument is "it uses a common cliche therefore it's fine" followed by meaningless attempts to mock Batman despite it being a way better movie. Now, decide if you're going to say something of value or shush. :P
I just realized the chat is like 10~15 secs ahead of my stream. Hmm.
IIFierceDeityII: Comedy, its what I'm good at

11,01How quick Annie is to turn evil.
bahahaha XD

13so.. the whole jedi ghost thing is mentioned before yoda drops it at the end

you'd think Jedi could take on this army
lets see how many jedi acidemys there are: corasant, Yavin, Korriban, Kasak, Balti, Bespin, and Hoth OVERALL A SHIT TON
>.>
13during all of that
13the battle is still raging just as hard
twilight_sprinkle: I didn't. I never did. I simply pointed out that General Grevious is a bad general.
1 hour left
Something of mine is raging quite hard.... :3
13it's the same timescale problem as empire... tons of time passes in one place, five minutes passes in another
Tell him to move to the high ground
Shizuka seems legit
CriticKitten: if hes a bad general, then its not because of that cliche.
CritcKitten shame that Grevous is bad here, considering how much ass he kicked in the 2D Clone War cartoon before he got crippled by Windu
What are the other 65 orders?
twilight_sprinkle: No, he's just a bad general because of pretty much everything he does in this movie, really.
xD
Xaiden|Okari nopony knows . . .
CriticKitten: like

Dat Jmo4267
dat rage
Quick_Thinker: star killer was more a warrior than a force master
Isnt it funny how a kid took out more soldiers?
who is that random jedi?
OW
And here we learn why they call them "younglings." Because this way you can say "killed younglings" and not "killed children" in a movie for children. That, you know, has boring politics and implied rape, but still... :|
the family guy version made more sense
Quick_Thinker: Transformers Syndrome.
[Alpha]: Oh definetly
Proto Chicken Walkers
oh hi thing that is just fna service
Bromance
Quick_Thinker: Numerous good guys are shown being cut down for the sake of lazily raising the stakes, even though none of them had dialogue or even names prior to their deaths.
Quick_Thinker: Named "Transformers Syndrome" because of its common use in Bayformers.
hell if i remember hte books had at least 1000 jedi surive the attack

I like how that little pod makes it past the atmosphere w/o any effort while the bigass gunships use like HALF their fuel for lift-off

>couldn't have survived that fall

>no need to bother checking if one of the most important Jedi is still alive or not
When will people learn? You ALWAYS survive falls that no one could survive!
no one could have surived that fall except a a jedi you morons

Azuredragon: have you done an evil backtake to the camera/

11,01I love the rushed pacing in this movie (not really).
Nittany_Discord: lol
11,01Took him 3 movies to die.
....you know I noticed something else rather odd.
hello!
so NOT ONE PERSON IS ARGUING AGAINST THOSE IDEAS NOT ONE NOT A SINGLE ALIEN FROM ANY PLANET NOT EVEN EARTH
11,01I hated those characters.
hello Roostythefatcock
Nittany_Discord: But they were so developed and logical!
Earth is in the universe i just got destroyed
hey oh man I love this movie
11,01Gunray should have died in Episode 1.
A lot of these lightsaber deaths in this film? You don't see limbs go flying off or people cut in half.
Quick_Thinker: no earth , galaxy far far away and a long time ago
and all
so whats up?
Nittany_Discord: everyone should have died in Episode 1...
were just watching the stream
what not a single jedi knight can kill anakin seriously they have in all 300 jedi knights at least
im almost finished with my octavia drawing
i have lost control of my left arm
ow!
octavia? never heard of him
You see them get slashed a bit and that's it. That's....kind of odd for a sword that cuts through everything. Is everyone just barely scraping their enemies across the chest to kill them instead of trying to slash through them?
in corasant they have 300 jedi knights
Canadian_Brony: what where you doing when you lost feeling?
...So why didn't they team up on the Emperor first and THEN kill Anakin? Why?! :[
cause der noobz
Canadian_Brony: Were you masturbating?
yes
:D
cratorkid I hit my funny bone. STFU Xaiden|Okari
Discord: Or kill Anakin first, then the Emperor.
Either or.
becuase the writers got drunk and wrote shit during that
Canadian_Brony: JUST JOKING
STFU anyway
Canadian_Brony: that hurts
13Petrified_Discord: it's that idiot ball everyone is clutching like crazy
Awwww
But splitting up was pretty stupid, yes. Everyone knows you never split the party.
IIFierceDeityII yes, my arm is in alot o fpain
rub and ice it Canadian_Brony
it'll be fine
a lie oh come on not even the jedi who finished lukes training (he was a suriver of the corsant betrayl
true story
CriticKittin: A lightsaber is just a concetrated light source and can burn through a lot of things, but not quickly. Its much easier to slash an enemy instead of getting slowed down by cutting a person in 2.
Nittany_Discord: guess whoever came first , or he noticed how many youve been getting
BEST MUSIC IN DA FAWKING WORLD
INCEPTION GOT NOTHIN ON THIS BITCH
11,01cratorkid: I don't mind.
you jelly?
Sabershy: And I'd be okay with that except that if you think about it? It tends to slash THROUGH the enemy in the original trilogy.
Xaiden|Okari: nope lotr has a better soundtrack
heck in the series he encounter anakin killing the younglings and attempts to fight him only to be thrown out a window and lose his leg
crap, didn't mean to type taht!
Who has seen The Dark Knight Rises?
not me
Roostythefatcock planning on it
cratorkid: TAKE THAT BACK :[
CriticKitten: Plus, they are working with wodden swords in a blue screen effect. Kinda hard to cut people in half with them
11,01I'm all for giving others a chance to get their questions answered.
Oh Anakin, you'ree so deep and complex.
stubed toe :'(
Lol, stubbing a toe SUCKS ASS
Xaiden|Okari: never , one of the best soundracks ever
:[
Xaiden|Okari: i brush my teeth to that sh*t
NO
Sabershy: The scene in the cantina? Arm comes off. Empire? Hand comes off. Return? Hand comes off.
Xaiden|Okari: That and stepping on legos. Yeesh.
11,01Egophiliac has stated that she does get multiple repetitive commands but chooses one at random if she uses a repeated command.
This movie? Everyone gets slashed across the chest when they die. o.O

DERPIES!

and the comics your not going to belive how much ass luke kicks he fucking cut a guy in 4
yes derpies
Xaiden|Okari: that shit hurts soo much
Xaiden|Okari: take that back... :'(
Sabershy: Take what back?
It's not even a flaw in the film, I just find it weird that limbs don't go flying rather often with a weapon like that,

PARTY:O
13inception odst? :3c
Roostythefatcock pls
Terrible things!
heck the one where certan troopers say fuck orderr 66 is cooler then this

It's okay to call them children.
ODST should have been a halo 3 add on XD
You won't lose your PG-13 rating.
Honest.
Sabershy: im still sticking with LOTR being my fav ost
Wait, what did I write?

Only a Sith deals in absolutes. Except for all of those times in the films where Jedi resorted to absolutes.
useless red bastards
CriticKitten: im mad because she smiled as she fell. who smiles when theyre being killed? ( i know about what happens to her later on )
NO ITS SYPHILLIS
But it's only the bad guys who do that, srsly.
Those red guys r teh best
JAZZ HANDS

See?
11,01And then he quits.
They were both pairing up well against each other, and Yoda just goes "welp time to go"
Nittany_Discord: He found Bronystate and it's stream and decided to sit in his chair watching for 20 something years. :)
Quick_Thinker: What i hate is it's never explained who was the most powerful force user in the lore.
THE FUCK YODA.
11,01Again, such rushed pacing in Ep 3.
:D little robot!
he quit because he couldnt win...
Did you get bored? The original trilogy was your fault, you could have ended it here damnit!

Nittany_Discord seems legit
Secondly, there is NO good reason for him to walk away with Anakin still alive when he knows he can't afford to let Anakin live if the universe is to be saved. What's with the rage-quits during fights? :P

Jmo4267: i was pony
pixel art is way more complex
You were pony.
Was using 2 browsers
anyway
Dken2021, for making gif you need to have the basis of pixel art
CrimsonPhoenix: Where do I practice?
Xaiden, open Paint
darn now theres more music I need to add to my list
that too
ok
and get some pixel tutorial
where?
My chrome would only type numbers, and my Firefox would not show the stream.

MahBoi777 om my gawd

Canadian_Brony: lol it' k
I never could get past those double jump spots
It's only the 2nd level. C'mon man
Kandarihu, in the ostrich yes
multi-multi-tasking
I could :P
Like I said I just used the Level Code
Kandarihu yea, but the branch is very low you'll likely hit it a lot
I passed it fair and square, trust me this level is so BS
11,02For those who want to get technical, I'm playing this on a Genesis Model 3 >>
TECHNICAL
The hell is dat?
aw man i remeber this game :) *Chocolate Old Lady voice* I ALWAYS HATED IT for being so hard lol ah memories.
damn this game was hard
srs bsns
SuperBrony64 so technical
this game is hard but damn is it fun to playu
I remember this in the movie!

They designed this for little kids, what the hell Disney
SuperBrony64, AW YEAH

MASF123, what do you mean?
11,02Moo O.O
I died so much at the first ostrich bit, I never got to hear the whole 16 bit version of this song
Mooooo
I wanted a game, that can be beat as a little kid
Image giving a 2 year-old MK3
Imagine
but MASF123 this can be beat as a little kid with enough patience and determination
Well I guess I'll have to hire someone to make my Desktop Pony OC, It cost like $600 to get the software that you use to CREATE them.
man i wanna see the Lion King world again in any sequel after KH 3D that would be neat hehe reminds me of KH 2 fighting Scar
no life kid maybe
and trust me as a kid you have A LOT of patience
A easy game for kids. Any of the Lego games :P
11,02Don't tell me I have to go back :<
Patience is a virtue. A lesson never taught.
Not really, little kids throw tandrums all the time
well there are logs there
SuperBrony64, this puzzle is quite complex I admit
*philisophical mumb-jumbo*
I would say I was very pesistent as a child
oooh
my cousins never have patience, they always want me to finish their games for them all the mtime
Dken2021, how old were you and your cousin?

SuperBrony64, you just looked in the net
my stream froze
lol stuck in a hotel room is not too fun! XD
huh
11,02CrimsonPhoenix: Yesh :<
xtremetoxicguy explore?
So, is this a flashcart or a physical cartridge. I'm guessing the latter
heh I do admit the puzzle is a bit retarded there
SuperBrony64, :( why you no answer le call
Panda|Homework, don't EVER use le again
ah man Sonic, probably that and Altered Beast that got me into gaming when i was like 3 or 4 :) ah good times
11,02This is an actual Genesis
CrimsonPhoenix, what?
except if you speak fench
so much jumping
Back in my day, we never looked up on the Internet, dail-up was too day slow.
11,02Panda|Homework: What call? O.O

Dken2021: Can't. My dad raged out of the room and told me not to leave
killerpony7733: Sorry my computer is really bucking up tonight. But no

I know it's a physical console. I was wondering about the cartridge.
SuperBrony64, skype duh XD

Ponies47: Aah

Kandarihu, SuperBrony64 doesn't pirate
the music is driving me crazyt

CrimsonPhoenix, wrong! he pirates all day :D
I need to get my cam fixed
ded
Alright, alright. Sorry. So how did he get his hands on this cart? He's obviously not experienced with it.
xtremetoxicguy I guess you don't have a taste in the genesis sound chip?

I played this game on the SNES.
Way better SuperBrony64
hey, it's Steamboat Willy!
cool!
lol now i keep hoping Sora,Donald and Goofy show up and help fight Pete
exactly my thought Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
Mickey doesn't need their help to take on Pete
it has somewhat something of KH 2 where you go back in time
ouch
NOOOOOOOOOOOO! SCHOOL STARTS IN ABOUT A MONTH! :'(
lol quick Mickey! Use Trinity! :D
Suck it up.
for a sec i thought the glove was flipping me the bird
Word of advice, don't die once you gonna need ALL your lives if you want to beat this game, even on easy diffculty
Dat ded

SuperBrony64: Wasn't there a donald duck ninja themed game ?
good morning everypony
Eli: I start high-school this year. So I'm nervious :s
Hye somepony_else
Ponies47: School isn't that bad :p
hey Ponies47

/me Hides "noname school is scary" shivers
morning somepony_else
hey Dken2021
hi somepony_else \
11,02Maui Mallard
Ponies47: enjoy your high school years
hello Canadian_Brony /)
SuperBrony64: That's it i really loved that game when i was little
11,02Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow was the game :3
11,02I have that on the PC somewhere ^-^
Ponies47: High school is way better than middle school, Trust me.
Derpy_Hooves: I'm just scared :s
dont be
Ponies47: schhool si scary... well at least if you're going to an all french school with wierd people and crazy teachers :P
noname: I hated middle school -_-
SuperBrony64: My mom has the cd around somewhere at home
Ponies47: Me to
I went from elementary to high. No middle school for me . . . worst school year of my life was the first year of high school
Watch out foe the bats, falling axes, and projectiles! :O
for
going to the bathroom was like Mission Impossible
someone else is in there and you GTFO
Canadian_Brony: What province do you live in? :s
BC
Canadian_Brony: Hey did you buy that 1 Rainbow Dash "I Can See Stuipd peopel" shirt yet? :P
Ponies47 nah, I opted out for this http://www.redbubble.com/people/edoxile/works/8632633-drink-cider-learn-nothing?p=t-shirt
Canadian_Brony: Oh yeah. When does school start for you?
beginning of September
this game has some pretty impressive sprites
high hopes S3 will be out by then
Hardest part of this level are the minecart looking part and the mad doctor boss battle
Same September 3rd for. It would be the 4th but you know freshman only day -_-
Canadian_Brony: ^
11,02fuuuuu
SuperBrony64: NEXT!
no more hits
dat bone
I see it like a 1 sec delay lol
Ponies47: Look at the bright side of starting school, season 3 comes out :)
Ponies47 I didn't have a "Freshman day" at the beginning of the year. Near the end of Grade 7 (last one before high), all the grade 7's walked over to the high school most of us would attend.
Ponies47 first day of Grade 8 was terrifying
left and right I'm dogding huge crowds and anyone with a beard
who isn't over 30
Mickey Mouse and Donlad Duck in World of Illusion is a much easier game, you should play that next if you want.
noname: LE GASP! You are so right. No wait... I'll be able to watch them but of coarse keep it sevret. With starting a new school and all NOBODY must know I watch MLP they would all ahte me and plus it would be a repeat of middle school no friends :<
Donald
11,02I love 3D effects in these games :3
the animations of that game here are amazing for that age
Canadian_Brony: I know I'm gonna be scared when I go to my first day of high school :s
@SuperBrony64 they look great because you know they are 2D, but they trick your eyes into thinking it's 3D
ouch
Ponies47 First year, you'll be terrified no doubt. Second year, I felt like I owned the place.
say anyone play KH 3D?
you died :D
I played it.
Sketch_Toku_Brony I haven't, but one of my friends does. He got it on opening day.
im kinda wonderin about the abilities you unlock w/ spirits and if theres a way to keep them but get rid of the spirit.
It was meh with a captial Eh, it's not bad at all, but just doens't feel astounding... :/
I know there was a secret in this room
O_____O
Canadian_Brony: First year I can agree sedond year bitch please :P
my eyes are filled with green
*second
like keep Leaf Bracer and wut not but get rid of the Spirit that carries those abilities
Super Brony try getting back on the...
too late
11,02Take note, this is the farthest I've ever gotten in this game without cheating :#
11,02:3
SuperBrony64 amazing!
Farthest I got was...uh, the level after the Knights level, it might be the ghost level if I'm correct. No wait I think I passed that too...
oh SuperBrony64 do you have Aero the acrobat?
Do you have World of Illusion?

WE ENJOY IT ALOT BECAUSE THY TURNS IT TO A NICE HOBBY
O_o what did i just say
Pfft
you can't tell me what not to like!
District 13 is a better film
It has David Belle
Automatically 999x better
God how many districts are there?
when I hear that, I immediately picture "Hunger Games"
AdamTheDuck originally, there were 13. After a war, 12 were left crippled. The 13th was obliterated.
00,02anyone else have this game?
00,02need crew
Sadly no. :(
i don't have it, but i'm thinking about buying it. looks neat
And thus came The Hunger Games themselves.
/me has no idea what The Hunger Games are.
AdamTheDuck: :O
well its a game and.... jeez im hungry
/me getting something to eat

TIS THE BEST AND DESERVES THY CANTERLOT VOICE

YAY
Canadian_Brony: Why do I have a feeling that the story involves some type of rebellion group to overthrow the power hungry hierarchy of some sort?
AdamTheDuck because that's what it is.
whats this game called?
AdamTheDuck 13 districts. 12 crippled, the 13th obliterated.
Oh how I do love some small group rebelling against the power...
Something about those type of stories that warms my heart... Only to see everyone die somehow somewhere in the story...
what is this game called?
RainBowJack: Guns of Icarus

Tldr.
;D
10/10
Too fun.
your welcome?
*you're
whatev
What are we watching anyway?
Malavolent: Guns of Icarus
Is it multiplayer?
Malavolent eeyup
yep
Looks pretty cool.
and 5€ on steam
Sumica Do a barrel roll!
No this is the online one, it's still in closed beta.
Can't buy it yet.
makes sense too
Don't ask how to do a barrel roll in an airship...
How do you do a barrel roll in an airship?
do a Barrel rol
with great difficulty
I see . . .
ok you can buy guns of Icarus online in 1 month, 1 week, 6 days and 7 hours
and 4 minutes
I think the crew should sing old sailor chanty
it's an airship, it should be able to float in water
that is water down there, right?
Nope, lava.
The floor is lava.
blue lava?
Sure.
make thicker hulls then float on the lava
or acid
Just use duct tape.
Problem solved.
AdamTheDuck I approve.
just use nokia
Duct tape is like the Force.
duct tape 3210s to the hull
It has its light and dark side and keeps universe together.
Malavolent: Dat metaphor.
hmmph
Duck tape repairs almost anything
If not, you're not using it enough.
okay, I'm hitting the hay. G'night everypony.
except surprisingly ducks for a given value of fix
00,10that was anoying
Night Canadian_Brony
the ultimate how to fix anything flowchart: is it moving > Yes > should it move > No > Duct Tape
Sleep well, Canadian_Brony.
hey Sumica would you add me to steam?
take it easy Canadian_Brony
Sumica: That's because you need to use more duct tape
I will now read until I can read nomore because I look like this http://mlpf.im/1eh
who needs wrenches when you have duct tape
you look like a pony Canadian_Brony? thats awesome
how about some kind of duckt wrench
00,10I will friend you if you fine me RainBowJack
I read that as Wenches
Ahahahahaha
Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream *yawn* n' stuff.

It happens when you ctrl + backspace
only that I JUST turned my computer on
yeah what game is this?
ninja_pony: Caesar 3
AAAAAH thx\
p.s does anyone know when fighting is magic may be coming out??
Ages yet
^
That is going to be a lot of whine.
damn
well, its gonna take even longer now that the game got leaked
i heard that season 3 comeing out this month?
gamerbrony12: same here u reckon it will be?
I'm pretty sure it's next month
i think so
I heard otherwise
Well, I hope it is
I heard you're all muffins.
^
It might be in september or october
I hope so tbh
ikr bt then again if the are premireing this month its a little short notice
we can all hope :3
I'm busy most of August and can't spend time ponypony
Serenity: lol same here
Untell the hub says eny thing, your guess is as good as eny pony elses.
so am i but i dont care XD
I don't either, I'd just prefer it next month
lol well atleast we know there is GOING to be a next season which is kickass anyway u look at it lol
There are only gonna be 13 episodes though
there probly gona be like 8 or 10 seasons :P
:'( what?
realy
Which means they'll have DOUBLE THE AWESOME!
i need more tehn that
I doubt it, I can only imagine 3-4 seasons discontinueing
is the number of episodes confirmed or just rumour, i thoguht nothing was set in stone yet
Personally I'd say maybe 5 or 6 seasons
I can say that chances are Bronydom will probably by dead by Season 4 or 5
possibly
Hi everypony!
:'( i hope MLP goes for EVER lol but still damn i need more episodes then taht
For 1 of 2 reasons: Dan Vs. Kicks arse, (underrated show D:) or they ruin it

Serenity: but i want to be british :'(
08,01if you're done, i mean
You can't be British if you aren't British
I have, and it's often hilarious
might be me, but that isn't 'becomig popular'...
Eli, it makes you a Dr Who fan.

Kandarihu: right :) that's true
08,01good afternoon all!
08,01let me know if the sound is okay
I already said hi ',..,'
08,01how's the volume/sync?
The sound is fine
buffering
Sound seems alright from here
It's buffering on my end.
hard to tell if its in sync from this video
Hooray ads!
Oi vey
08,01british adverts
08,01enjoy
I haven't seen a British advert in years
08,01so currently, I'm streaming Doctor Who
Not had a TV in years
08,01for next 15 minutes, then i'm streaming the tennis!
Yay!
what episodes of Who are you streaming?
dafuq
dat hair
08,01Eli: the 2nd non-canon film
sounds nice
08,01it's based on the 1st Doctor's serials, but it has Peter Cushing as The Doctor
08,01so it's not actually considered canon
08,01but it's good fun
Exterminita?
yeah... i'm not really familiar with british actors. who's peter cushing?
ouuu they have a rainbow hard on these lottery tickets :3
hearts*
08,01the stream might buffer for a few minutes
hey guys
hey Chrysalis :)
hia Chrysalis :)
08,01Eli: Peter Cushing is that british imperial guy from Star Wars
Hey Chrysalis.
Britain is fucking corrupted by bloody Bingo nowadays
Well I'm off, night everyone. :)
2/5 adverts are Bingo adverts
Night AdamTheDuck :)
bye AdamTheDuck
what episode of Star Wars?
Oh dear
08,01Eli: no idea
El shitbox is not coping with this memroy leak well
Episode 4
08,01that one with Peter Cushing, i presume
If it's Tarkin, I'd presume 4
can't remember him
'real people, not actor' => actors are not real people?
08,01shana: of course not
So, this channel. It's just called 5?
shana: what are you thinking? everyone knows they're not
08,01Kandarihu: yup
Hmmm, getting an fps of around 3-6 on stream
Channel 5
I presume
Is this show, just called V?
same here.
there are black dits on my stream
dots*
it looks like a slide show to me.
Oh noes, Dahlekz
Gotta go, be back in a bit
/me smacks the video refreash icon to get it to work on his side.
what do you call a little filly that wants to EXTERMINATE you ? A Daaaaawlek
Maybe it's becuase i'm watching this from Anchorage AK.
Bloody buffering, why wont Google just take over already and set up my neck of the woods with fiber internet already?
Noir: there's no stream right now so don't try to hard :)

08,01i love tennis
Weee, Tennis
08,01so this is the match for bronze medal
08,01it's Del Potro vs. Djokovich
Tennis at the olympics .......i dont even ..... what next ? double dodge ?
08,01Del Potro is very much like Federrer, but without so much elegance
Tennis has been olympic for years
08,01Djokovich plays a fast game
08,01but this is on grass, so it's not going to be too fast to comprehend
/me 08,01prefers lawn tennis
I still want some kind of serious e-Sport Olympics :/
08,01Lil_B: start it
i don't like tennis that much. but i watch some federer matches... i kinda enjoy watching him live in Gstaad
Once they put Motorsport in Olympics, I will start watching it :
:3
30 love and tolerate
08,01Lil_B: hahahaha
08,01hahaha
08,01like i have money

08,01goddamnit, where is the Federrer game...
08,01wooooo!
08,01FEDERER!

NOO
08,01gymnastics...
08,01ha! gaaaaaaaaaaay!
Sounds like a Spanish name
dude Lil_B ! he's swiss
08,01MadSurge: woo! \o/
08,01oh
Eli sry, I don't follow olympics and i couldn't see a flag :P
he's wearing red and white
Eli yeah... well, that could have been Austria as well or Poland XD
It could be Indonesia , do you know how many variations of the polish flag there is?
Lil_B: i don't follow the olympics either, but federer is kinda a rolemodel around here
There's like 4 with different rotations of the Polish flag
08,01okay, it may buffer for a few minutes
i'm raping the refresh button. and strangly enough, my headphones are giving me fapping noises...
no kidding
I have thjem too XD

Tennis is fine.

But...
08,01but federer... oh my... he is just... amazing...
Scottland Sucks
:P
i have no idea who's playing
I just like to watch the technique of the players and learn from it.
08,01how's the stream?
08,01is it clear enough?
08,01is the sound there?
08,01oh god, that was a good shot
we're NOT supporting Murray. At least i'm not
08,01heh, i see you're in swizerland <3
ok, I'm with Federer, I like his name
08,01hmm

I'm glad sunrise is less than an hour away - Im scared now
Hello!
flawless plan
how do you sleep through somthing with explosions and alarms going off ._.
"humorous" :D
ambient track would be better in a scene where they're walking around outside the sealab
brbsies
why not leave
yup
05he is?
:) Sometime in October, Im going to share this ambient track
probably not
He read that book and a squid poped up
05hmm
he's aslo scared of jellyfish
this movie is wierd ._.
DUN DUUN
maybe when he's asleep
05if you turn out to be right i ban you for spoilers, if not, then you are free to go
but good ._.
:D
D:

too scary
whut
:D
harry is talking through the monitor
wrong spiral direction?
explosives :O
uh oh
cant trust no one in this movie
harry ever left the sphere?
lucky harry
dirty harry
XD
I wonder if berry knows
it's like i'm watching Seinfeld
rolf
she wants all the drugs
asscheek
Xax likes le peni1z
right.
guess who it is
someone I know obviously
@ya dont say
pony_7008 sounds like they like the banhammer
thats what he wants you to think...
05whoever you are, you dont just get on here and antagonize our users, so behave or get the fuck out.
chill out i know him irl
05that is no excuse
the rules dont care
Chill out
i bet an eel will pop out
like one of those fake nuts snakes
No, Wrek says no, i say no
hahaha
05now that you know the terms of your stay here, act accordingly.
why wont she help him @_@
wtf ._.
Wrek can I buy you an icecream to say sorry ?
how the fuck are seprents so deep under water supposed to know the time of the day?
some lab..
Dark_Horst: internal clock
05no, you can act according to our rules.
Accept my damn ice cream
ohod
:<
oh god
Flyboy without external stimulous internal clocks are incredibly unreliable
cant trust no one in this damn movie
hi :)
What movie is it?
is this that underwater movie where their own dreams kill them?
is the voice off a bit?
oh wow...
05was too lazy to change back
im scaredd
what is this.
eh as long as the captions are fine :D
the pressure will kill him first
WAHTA
what is sthiss???
looks like aliens vs predator
Would have been crushed like a soda can as soon as he opened the hatch
wouldnt he drown if he took the medicine
05Cypresswolf: why?
lmao was that the guy of matrix
the blue pill red pill guy
they're at the sea floor, the pressure outside would be far greater than the pressure in the room
05fRizZ: nope
05thats anotehr black guy
aww
hahaha
Movie name anyone?
i feel like watching the matrix :P
lmfao
LMAOL Madness
05Cypresswolf: i guess the room depreassurized when the water began flooding
05hence the jars exploding
eww
ohai
05so when the thatch finally opened it wasnt that big a deal
one metric ton of pressure per square meter and meter of water depth
dead body O_O;
05oh right
05i forgot the depth preassure in general
05yeah probably
id laugh if the door opend and smashed him in the face
WREK IS SPY!!!!!!!
fRizZ: it opens upwards
fml
-didn't read sign that said cauton door opens from above
:<
shes all like "my precciousss"
How did his hair dry that fast?
he is a changeling! kill it!
05then again he'd probably be in hypothermia now aswell
05so lets say
05movie logic
05that should solve these things
lmao id laugh if he did the ya dont say face and said "nooo im a ghost"
id prob die
everyone went into the sphere lets just say that
probably
most vertainly
*certainly
there they finally admit it
Time to sleep for me, Goodnight everyone

Dat suspense

Dat timer
bob: movie logic

Can't they wish themselves out?
NOPONY GETS LEFT BEHIND
they have to fear their mothers-in-law more than what's down there...then they can go back

how did they know
05you missed the message that the storm was over Chrysalis
ah ok, thought there was a timer for that
Wrek: but the message also said that the ships just started coming back. six hours delay
Dark_Horst yeah i thought that

He's not, he keeps his computer on 24/7

oh well then
but anyway
and a song came
on
flood kick?
i cannot remember it
really they're using cgi
ok most of the guys are costumes
all i know about it is that in the name were the letters dhg
alexxm: Think about godzilla, think how crap it'ta looked if it was CGI
the hairy guy is real. probably from denmark
you guys got anything
???
05hey
this is not enough, Gamefreak324
05you try to pull off a realistic insectoid as a human
05you are too fat
Serenity i know i wasn't saying i was happy about the cgi
damn it
alexxm: I know, I was agreeeing :3
i was hoping you guys wpuld have something
05regarding what?
oh ok Serenity
*Ponyshrug*
there are 30gb of pony songs around
ask the station for the playlist it used at this point of time
but everfree radio tends to stick to the samme stuff
Star Trek!
that might narrow it down to 10 to 20 songs
That reminds me, I should totally vote for Godzilla for filmnight as a B
ok the lyrics were
some of them at least
which godzilla
in b4 the xindi blow up earth
good morning everyone :D
Possibly Vs. Mothra
05Gamefreak324: we dont have any affiliatiosn with them as far as i know
hi teentro :)
twilight sparkle pinkie applejack and fluttershy
Only worry is, there's a 70% chance the mods don't currently have godzilla vs. Mothra in their playlists
WHAT, Star Trek aliens that aren't just people with skin conditions? :O
and i know that most songs don't name evry pony in a row
major on the same table as a sergeant? don't they have any manner in starfleet?
what is it we are looking at???
teentro: The stream
:O
realy???
Yeh
o gosh :S
teentro: Star Trek Enterprise
this was realy...
unexprected :D
Gamefreak324: write a mail to everfree radio. your chances of success are far better there than here

Flyboy: blahblah non image links blahblah
star wars is more fantasy than anything
Star Wars is overrated
Serenity: oh right :$
[Alpha]: your face is overrated
05both of you are morons for even arguing
Flyboy: he'S right, you know?
Overrated = bad?
Illogical please come up witha comebcak that wasn't thought up by a child

EpicCookieTime: No non image links during stream
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
Serenity: no. overrated = overrated

Big_Macintosh_1992: Firstly, I. Do. Not. Drink. Secondly, it's 18 in my country

Suddenly chat died
accidentally closed the tab
It's your fault.
pie ._.
/me slaps AdamTheDuck
meh
Star Trek game?
http://derpy.me/Lk6Pd
or just an episode?
i requested Flutterwonder (Underp0ny Remix)
[Ghost-Alpha]: Me likey
:D
I never find these Soviet Russia jokes funny...
that the one?
I want a burger bed
i'm so confused. Is that really a Star Trek opening theme?
I do too but I could not resist ading that joke
ok i would rather watch a video game than star trek
Serenity: a burger bed? or a "i want a burger, bad!"
i'm not that big of a fan
Bed
I'm vegetarian :3
oh
:D
everyfree radio sure hides the audiostream button well
If its Star Trek it should be either the Original Series or TNG
05id love to make you a veg burger though Serenity
i wanna eat a burgerwhile being eaten by that burger
^
String_Shredder: But don't many banks rip you off one way or another?
derpy_pony: did i request the right one
Wrek: It's alright, my diet is cake and vengence
PONY SWAG!!!!
Yay I sparked a conversation
first brony song i ever heard!!
This reminds me of the veg burger BBQ. It never happened.
:S:D
six point star and BOOM MIC!
I've never had a vegburger, I bet they are horrible
Neither have I.
:>
I've had a veggie burger
05over here? they are good
Well, I guess I should sleep, got off work after a night shift. Have a good one guys
05home made? fuckign awesome
Night Big_Macintosh_1992
The megamix converted me to the herd
Wrek: I'm in Britain, so I'm not sure here
Bye Big_Macintosh_1992
I prefer the original, Gamefreak324. But this one is good too
oh yea
Mine was mostly composed of beans and corn
haters
yay
20% cooler
Can I link the welcome song?
lol
why would a vulcan wear a shirt that didn't cover her stomach? that is highly illogical
I was thinking of going to Italy for all the pizza and such
TheMaster: it depends whats her intensions ;)
Because I like most italian foods
this remix was made very well
05also TheMaster
I'll eat anything except shillean food
Chillean
05sto pbeing populist
I'm not really a food eater
I pretty much can survive on 1 meal per day
populist? What?
swag
Serenity: yeah...survive. Most people can do more than just survive :)
this one is awesome, Gamefreak324
05nah, but really you shouldnt bash otehr star trek branches jsut cause they arent tng
Same here serenity but I have really high metabulism so it doesn't work out well
can = want to
yay pony parodies
LOL
Alchemist: Considering I do lot of running about and such, eating as much as I do and doing what I do will really kill your will
I actually like the original more then TNG. I just found the opening theme song to be a little off for a star trek sort of thing.
OH THIS IS GOLDEN!
What is it Gamefreak?
Though I do like the obvious higher production values for this.
this is made very well
get on everfree radio
here p.m the link
You can tell they spent quite a budget on this show, but unfortunately, the acting isn't up to scratch with what it could be
That's my only crtitizism on this show
Serenity: Im not saying you have to change your habits, but note that its probably not healthy to eat only once per day (no matter what size that meal is)
there ya go
both Shatner and Stewart did a lot of shakespeare
Alchemist: I know that, but I've done it for years.
next is one in a million then flutterwonder
Serenity: doing it for years doesnt make it more healthy :D
well, that escalated wuickly
dammit, q-key, why do you elude me?
top left
I've done the same for a long time
awwww yeah
i know where it is, but somehow it doesnt want to get hit
must be some sort of improbability field around it
Alchemist: Don't forget you can get nutrition from drinks as well, which is something I have quite a bit more than food to be fair.
Nowhere near as much as food, but still some :)
let the rape commence
or dinner
um
or both
Fight to the death
Hmm, I wonder what's for dinner
Serenity: of course, and there are pills that have all the vitamins you need for a day, but it doesnt mean you dont need to eat
is it just me or does this song suck?
it's alright
i hate it lots
I listen to electronic music so much I consider myslef part robot
I am sick as hell currently... and D ABUCK IS DIS!?
Serenity: long story short, if you are fine with it then do it, just know there are alternatives.
Star Trek
end already!!
If Ya gave me a chanch to see the enterprise I douldve guessed. Then again I asked.
Gamefreak just mute it
i don't care how you do it!
Good morning Bronystate!
05Gamefreak324: jsut mute it you douche
yes
good afternnon Jim :)
it's over and you put the volume all the way down
it is now gone
So.. What is Bob Ross (my name for him) pony painting today? Twilight still? Alrighty then.
Hey Jim :)
:( they skipped flutterwonder
FYI Stormwolf and Glaze are good Brony artists
Eyup, Jim
So what's going on today then?
wtf!!
where does enterprise take place in the star trek timeline?
Jim: Sod all
is this well after TNG?
angry face
The_Greener: before tng
The_Greener: infact, before tos
it'll probably come up next
05this is about 2 or 3 lifetimes post the zefphram cochrane laucnh
05iirc
Gamefreak I can give you the link to the orginal version of the song
i'll wait
oh hey, wrong ping, againm
/me slaps Dark_Horst. Learn to tab better :P
Nowadyas there is almost always a stream.
i like this one
you people stop using the "the"-prefix like crack
Zat Vas Delicious.
did he just eat a mask-full of maggots?
yummy
would you people eats a pot full of maggots if he offered it
05looked more liked mashed banana
If you find this gross go to australia. We have something thta is almost identicle just instead of bugs its tiny insects. The type that gather around your computer screen at midnight.
Not many people know of it.
Flutterwonder is on Gamefreak
here it is
fruitflies?
so wait what's this you sent me??
:)
Master Chief
Beyond her garden by woodentoaster
yea but
05[Ghost-Alpha], Gamefreak324. please keep your EFR talk in PM
sorry
does it have anything to do with flutterwonder
the new one from woodentoaster is good too. "awoken"
oh alright
hm...
05i had forgotten these EPs were 40 mintues long :D
Well I'm done with the ghost part of my name
mind fudge in -3..-10...-20
hmmm
05and then
05the chat stood silent once more
hi
what race is the black guy in the red uniform?
05unkown
TheMaster: jackassian
05do you know the story so far of this branch?
05id happily fill you in a bit
STORY TIME!
This episode or the series?
Wrek: please do
05this part of the series
go ahead. I'm interested. is enterprise the most current Star Trek?
05besides the recent movie i do think so
05only got 4 season made though due to low ratings
TheMaster: the newest series, but it takes place pre-TOS
any news on the sequel the new movies getting
05the lowe ratigns are kind of understandable casue the 2 first seasons were slow and quite boring
05but the latter 2 seasons were really nice
What show was this again?
05right now however there was an attack on earth. the only starship in sue at the time is equipped with more lillitary equipment than standard.
05use
05m*
so this is pre-kirk and all that?
05the attack was jsut a test probe made by the race called xindi
05yes
yeah
05this is like only 2 or 3 lifetimes after the first warp launch
05now the prope originated from waht is known as the expanse
neat. So they don't get bogged down in the canon made in TNG. no Q, Borg etc.
05and now the enterprise of the time is sent into the expanse to find the xindi
i think the borg appear in one episode
05this is the 3rd episode of season 3. the beginnign of the xindi chapter
that's not how you se a gun
thats pretty big for a phaser. Not invented yet?
you're fucked now
So why did fans really dislike this series?
Brn!
TheMaster: they are. those guys just are someone else
05actualyl in the first season they didnt have phasers untill liek the last few episodes
TheMaster: also, there are phasers in rifle from
05heck the ship didnt get torpedoes untill liek 3 episodes ago
I always liked the phasers over the blasters in star wars. It always bothered me that light could be blockable/dodgeable
yeah, they had normal boring missiles for a long time
:3 I should be at work by now - I'm trying to track a co worker down
05hopefully you get to see soem more of the ship soon
05for isntance shield tech doesnt exist yet
they also dont use shields. they just polarize the armor palting of the hull
this can't be good
damn you wrek
thats pretty cool. Is good that they didn't rush things techwise
05whic his probably why many fans hated it
05i mean come on
05whats? a star trek without sheield and phazurs? preposterous
maybe they just wanted more holo-deck episodes
i dont get it. shouldnt it be interesting to see how all that fancy tech started out?
i know I find it interesting
05same here
05but really
08,01wheee
05you are a brony right?
08,01no?
05you know how stubborn fandoms can be
08,01s/an/em/
the fans should be more open
08,01it's funny because i used a regex to make a bdsm joke
sometimes it seems we all just want to burn whatÄs new
only you :p
hah. Fandom gets mad when a canon map gets put out
"it ruined my headcanon!"
TheMaster: ...they got mad over that?
Bass Cannon?
Some did
...now this i seriously dont get
:P
05also the first season was very slow and generalyl dull
05acting on sexy vulcan to keep it going
08,01ah, still watching Enterprise?
05now and then they had to "decontaminate" by being practically nekkid in a blue lit room crasing themselves in
fandoms get all butthurt whenever someone doesn't fit into their little square peg hivemind
No Vulcan is sexier then that junior officer in Wrath of Khan
adorable Vulcan was adorable
i feel as if the ending theme would have been the better opening theme
Good morning, everypony! :)
Hi RaveBrony !
I wish the TNG movies were half as good as the Original series movies
how you doing RaveBrony
/me waves to Jim and alexxm :$
Im doing good, and yourself?
i'm good
wat movie is this?
mornin meh brony brotha
pony1553: series
where are the Klingons by the way? Arn't they suppose to be the bogeymen of the federation at this time?
k
05there were actually alot of kingons early on
05but this takes place in the expans mostly
05expanse*
05in fact
05the very first episdoe has klingons
do they look like they do in the original or do they have the wrinkly forheads?
i wonder , do klingons in this series look like the old klingons ? or the new ones ?
mindhive
05wrinkly foreheads
05atleast partially
But I thought they said the wrinkly forheads were from a plague, or they were like cloned...something klingons
like Krogans in mass effect
05for season 3 and 4 they changed the blue lit grease-up with the massages
Does Archer have some sort of disease?
05TheMaster: i wouldnt be suprised if it was casue "tng had wrikly foreheads adn they have had for a while so the make up artist gave them it"
05but meh
What the fuck is this?
enterprise
05Brother-Aura: why so hostile?
05might be that too
05as for archer beign sick
05im afraid i dont udnerstadn your question
You said that they had a blue gel thing and then switched to massages.
Does Archer just have Kirk-like swag and wants a Vulcan chick to rub him down every episode or is there a reason.
05oh
05that is archer
05the one getting the massage is tucker
05the engineer
quite the scabs he's got
ah okay.
05but as i was saying. you know there always is those episodes where they get a virus or something
05and as quaranten after away missions
05blue lit room and creasing
05greasing*
05it hurt the show more than it added
sort of seems like they just did it for fan-service
05yeah it was
they sure did
05to 80%
05"How can we keep people interested in the new branch?" "grease up the vulcan chick!"
O.o
the tone is a little different then the star-trek i'm use to. I actually thought this was star gate when I first saw the opening scene before the theme
more military-adventure then the science fictiony
05well it kidna does fit
greta archer. you made him sad
05we have jsut recently gotten used to the "not alone in space" thing
05i wouldnt be suprised if the old millitant roots still sit in
05if that makes sense
they need Kirk to show them that the future should be making out with green skinned chicks.
or Picard on the merits of drinking tea
05picard got me to try earl grey
or Q
05been drenkign it for breakfast quite often sicne then
05well
05wehn i wake up
space hookers
:O
Wrek do you like game of thrones at all?
i'd buy that for a dollar
05TheMaster: streamed both seasons alteady >:3
damn. I missed it
05waiting for the 3rd now
Skilled xD
man. I don't know how they'll fit Storm of Swords in one season
I can't wrap my brain around it
theres just too much that happens
05i actualyl read the books post the watchign the seasons
Wrek: When is th e 3rd season supposed to come out?
april
05but i havent read further than the seasons have gone ish
aaaanndd sprrroinnnnnng
:D
Jaqen H'gar is like 50x cooler in the tv series then in the books
i'm convinced he's actually a time lord assasin
hay gaaaaaauuuy
Sup Jim
I'M BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Welcome back Dark92Enigma
/me hugs everypony
how you doing Dark92Enigma
slavery? in my star trek?
SPACE WHORE GONE WILD
TheMaster, It's more likely than you think.
05nooo not the critters!
so did the federation not share its replicator technology?
alexxm I'm fine, just got off the hook (i'm not grounded anymore)
The poor wildlife D:
you'd think that would end all conflict save for stuff with crazy races like the borg
not the space bunnies!
Didn't the NC reviewed this one? <---
05TheMaster: you mean in this?
05Dark92Enigma: if he did i havent seen it
Well star trek in general? does the federation in this not have replicators?
Dark92Enigma i don't think so
05not yet
05they still have a shef!
05;D
05chef*
05in fact you can barely call it a federation yet
05more like a vulcan/human alliance
05with some bonuses
This is Star Trek: The Series.........not Star Trek: Generations, right?
how do replicators work anyway? Can the federation just mass produce any matter they want for less energy then the put out?
I WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE SHIP!!
05this is not generations
oh, now i remember...........this is the series!
give er the dick
c'mno man
hopefully they don't accidently give him ginger. Some races like that more then is healthy
balck pepper. it's awesome invaluable luxury stuff. trust us
nobody will get that reference...
05hehe
SPACE DRUGS(AKA spice)
05nice one
05oh also
05i didnt tell you
oh you read harry turtledove?
he's happy
inb4 he snorts it
05but the enterprise doesnt have that shielding yet
05hecne the inconvenience
05for isntance they were raided by pirates jsut casue they were knocked out by a distrotion
seeing low-tech star trek is pretty cool.
I've read what late federation tech is like and its pretty crazy
Time Lord crazy
What's up?
05for isntance the final ep of TNG
05seeign the tech on the "future" ships was awesome IMO
05but it works both ways
I hate those uniforms, I liked the old ones better
the full body yellow and red ones?
yup
05also TheMaster: pony1553 is a practical example of why it got low reviews
it's time for space hanky-panky
05nah jsut joking
This looks interesting... oh damn it all... I have to go. Bye!
well I always thought the federation was really sort of like if you fused the air force with NASA
awwwww yeah
like they're not sure how military-ish they should be.
05right now they have a millitary troop onboard
05and there is some friction between them and the crew
Hey everypont
and suddenly, I come back to sexy time
makes sense. It would be expensive to try and make two kinds of ships
unleash the power of the sun
05suddenly i am a pont
Lol!! xD
oh god. Is that guy a cylon?
MIND CONTROLL!
:S
05specially this early in the whole "we are not aloge otu there" phase
05heck
she's gonna rip his heart out
05the second NX class hip was barely half done when they left for the expanse
05ship*
Speaking of crossovers. Did you know they wanted to do a crossover ep of star trek with dr.who?
well... its not my kind of a show... but with queen its getting interessting :D
ooops
kablooey
05i didnt know that
05sounded quite interesting
dem eye brows
Trip doesn't know what went wrong
05and im sure you are able to follow by right now they are tryign to synthesize their own trellium D
so that they don't get wiped out by gravity?
evil space hooker
kiss her :|
05TheMaster: more or less
oooh :(
is that a teleporter?
05yep
KISS her :D
05the first experimental teleporter
oh -.-
inb4 she's a pheromone sprinkler
05they didnt start using it untill season 2 though in emergency situations due to high scepticism
oh my
it's time
sexy time
I would be skeptical too. Knowing how it functions.
05aye
she sort of looks like river song
they once beamed someone up and he had leaves and branches stuck everywhere in him
so this one doesnt use all those things like bio.buffers yet
they still have candles in the future
they still have candles now. theres no reason they'd go away
vulkan meditation
>trying to mind control a vulcan
goodluck
i knew she was evil
she needs to nerve pinch her
like a reverse cylon, doing lighty things to your spine
it's time to enter the prise
05i never got into battlestar galactica, the new or the reboot
You know what they should do? A HBO/TV series of the simarillion
imagine how amazing that would be
05a shame it seems like an interesting show
05only been able to catch late night episodes on TV6
05should i DL them or is it a waste of time
Wrek: it'S interesting, but it's also stuffed with way too much drama
I mostly watched the new one with my dad, who is a fan. It was alright but I dunno. Sci-fi has never been my particular fancy
05adn yet here we are talkign about star treck :P
05kÄ*
But yeah. Lots of drama and the premise sort of gets drawn out
star trekä. must be swedish
"we're running from evil robots. they're trying to find us"
05ive got that much :P
05hehe ^_^
Oh I like good sci-fi. But I prefer it when it doesn't take itself too seriously if that makes sense. Sci-fi series that try and ground themselves in 'realism' arn't as good in my opinion compared to the 'fun' sci-fi like original TNG or dr.who
do the airlock trick!
original star trek
05TheMaster: yeah i think i get your point
mostly because the writers seem to underestimate the size of the universe. It makes it seem silly that individual characters can have a impact in a story the size of a galaxy
How did they ever reconcile the original series storylines with the more serious-tone of TNG and the later ones?
which was awesome by the way
05a projectile weapon would work against those guys rather easely
05id keep a revolver with me
projectile weapons work against most soft living things
Wrek: didnt picard fight invaders on his ship with a crossbow once?
05actually yes he did
these guys are pretty well equiped
05well they are the more millitant and agressive xindi
HEY EVERYPONY! :)
hello every pony
hi Ponies47
hi RainBowJack
how you doing Ponies47
05dat gland
its a Pinkie pie Gland
shouldnt they also analyze the suit?
to much sugar
/me glomps Ponies47
/me hugs Jim
did any pont see CCCP ?
I'm good alexxm. How about you?
i'm good Ponies47
/me Hugs Jmo4267 back :3
:3
05well i got a little while logner
051 more EP shouldtn harm
FOUND IT
please proceed
NO MORE BHG
YESSS
proceed!!!!!!!
ack i hate the whole "humans are somehow better than other species" thing
YES
everfree is playing it
awesome
cone!?!
05good thing this one doesnt use that one then P4ngya
cone
the cone of doom
didn't you just hear what she said?
05there are more to these than a bio scan can tell
the hells happening did they encounter face huggers
WHAT did she said?
Well this is a pleasant surprise in the morning
Dark92Enigma: what wrek said
OH
Ello there everypony.
so are they doing an aliens cross over
Hello Malavolent
05i cant see how this implies that humasn are the better species
how you doing Malavolent
/me That's what she said
alexxm: It's freaking hot in here, other than that, I'm pretty good. How abou you?
i'm good Malavolent
she mad
Close enough, but it's not KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Or CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
:O Binding of Isaac's new final boss... is Isaac himself!
okay. I've stayed away from the topic long enough. I've been very patient these last few months. But is there any word on season 3?
TheMaster: there will be ponies
^it will exist, that's all i need to know
somes aid it was supposed to start august, but that got elayed
05it will exist
*delayed
Amen P4ngya
05it will air before the year ends
05more than that
It will contain ponies.
05we acnt say here
05casue it goes agaisnt the no spoiler rules
I guess I'll have to look forward to Dexter
Season 3 spoilers are a bannable offense
it shall never come
It'll only be 13 episodes from what I've heard
05the latest season will air here in a week though
05of dexter that is
oh dexter
05you say only 13, i say "yay 13 more!"
I think the 13 is meant to leave it open for more if it gets enough response
and the hub/hasbro would have to be insane to nix it so quickly
I think there will be 13 episodes and a movie.
even if they're already at 18+ hours of content
@Wreck = I don't mean that as a bad thing. I actually wouldn't mind seeing them scale it back
Dat Wreck
no. More Ponies for the Pony god. More daw for the daw throne
they got tom
icwatwudidthar TheMaster
It can't be that expensive to produce episodes
space rocks yay!
what are they looking for?
why are they collecting asteroids
its flash, very detailed flash, but still flash
for the alloy?
and the VAs can't cost that much
05as ytou can see TheMaster, the already experimental transporter got screwed by gravitron distortions
darn gravity.
hello everyone
05casue they need the base ore to make trelliuum D
stupid all-constant and inescapeable force of the universe!
Honestly if Season 3 goes out as strong as Season 2 more or less, I'm fine with it being the last season. I've seen way too many cartoons that I have loved more that would have killed for a 65 episode run
oh look, they have a redshirt witht hem
well, okay, not quite red but you knwo what i mean
Hey Thrackerzod
gravity is basically the production of acceleration, right?
I don't think there were redshirts in Enterprise
I don't mind series getting run into the ground. Spongebob and simpson had seasons and seasons before they collapsed. Better to dare to greatness then to hold back and cut it off before you get all you can
all you have to do is stop watching
Riders or a anti-mattter real matter gen
a noname military guy in the background? that guy is begging for death
ensign ricky, take point
red shirts always die
if i'm ever on a star ship I will loudly say my last name wherever I go.
I am JACK ASS here i cvome?
helps to avoid being murdered
the only thing that annoys me on this series is the perverse amount of bloom
05i dont get it
bloom, blur, whatever it is you call that optic filter
not really , nameless redshirts dieby the dozens to show that there is danger or whatever , named redshirts die gruesomely to motivate the main cast
it was worst in the first season
vulkan zombies. greta
*great
I guess the only way to not die is to get a important position in the ships hierarchy
05red-shirt is doing well
05he will live to die another day
HIYA everypony
is that pfhase gun set on stun?
Hey Bronysith
he broke the system!
He won't die. He's a helmsman
hi Bronysith
space zombies?
05space zombies and pirates
so they only have stun and kill ? how about stun more ? why do theyexpect stun to work on everything ?
atleast they're not turning into freaky tentacle monsters
the borg?
the borg are not zombies
where's smas arn when you need her
they have tickle, they just never mention it
05they also have th e slight cough setting
Wrek and suddenly space ninjas
05and the limb setting
all played by ponies.
this problem would be solved if they had a shotgun or a chainsaw
I wonder what a vulcan pony would look like XD
05no it would be solved it tpol had let them use kill isntead of stun
did anyony see CCCP today?
if only they could set phasers to hug
05nope not me
TrixieMuffins: this is still pretty primitive tech in this series. only tng phasers have precise strenngth regulation
they'd look like this http://cdn.walyou.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/07/Spock-Pony-e1341908055352.jpg
lol
i refuse to click on that
alpha just told me that the program to get those desktop ponies
costs like 600 bucks
Huh. THey really are ninjas
that true??
05hes fucking with otu
it costs 600 intenret dollars
05you*
Gamefreak324, It is free
lol k
how did they miss that guy
you'll have to make atleast 4 youtube videos to earn that much internet money
these guys look like they are froma vault
yay nother smoke break!
uh oh. She let her emotions get out of control
your a bulkhead
TrixieMuffins: *you're
so a vulcans default state is a zombie?
05hehe
many the entire ship just went into pon-far or something
maybe*
05mhm
website is offline? wtf?
i hit retry now it works
he did nothing
why do they store anti-matter its fucking dangerous if you touch it youll doom the whole universe XD
05becasue it powers the engines
05you do you keep rocket fuel in yoru rockets
05if it can explode
why do you breathe oxygen? its very flamable
no it isnt every single human being on this earth breates it
breathes*
oh hello, Wrek ^_6
^_^
05hai rain :D
sonicandmario85: oxigen is very flammab´le. you may ask any chemist
how are you? ^_^
*oxygen
what does a fire need to work?
if i didnt breathe i would die
gas is the one very flamable
oxygen is a gas
learn how to breathe something less flamable
TheMaster: Air, fuel and something else
Heat
05oxygen, fuel, heat
we should all breathe helium. that one dowsnt blow up
if its very flamable why do you breathe it? we cannot survive without air if we didnt need to breathe we wouldent have a fucking nose
we breathe it because without the oxygen your muscles couldn't twitch or move
05so you heart would stop
This conversation is making me chuckle.
wood is flamable but they don't burst into flames just because they're flamable
05being unable to supply your brain with fuel to work properly
05so it would stop sending the signal to your ehart to pump
What we watching?
05henceforth death
oxygen is flamable but lucky for us the atmosphere is only 7% oxygen
sonicandmario85: see? and the ship there wouldnt move without antimatter
TheMaster you dont seriously believe that do you?
21% my bad
Shooeie: star trek
05its only 7% uhm
05whatever you englis hspeakers call it
Nice spelling there Wrek
TheMaster:actually i think theres actually lots of oxygen on this planet
You don't say sonicandmario85 >_>
Why are we talking about oxygen percentage?
and without the nitrogen plants wouldn't grow
because science
05Shooeie: he asked why they store antimatter if its so darn dangerous.
Shooeie: becasue antimatter
05it fuels the engines
^
typically dangerous things make for good fuel
05why does he breathe oxygen if its flammable
05becasue it fuels his body
Anti-matter is best matter
05partially
Wrek: actually, the engines are fuelled by the electricity from the matter/antimatter reaction in the warpcore
because of how much energy is stored inside. energy, when uncontrolled, can lead to cool explosions
God bless space explosions
*nerd*
antimatter makes a looooooot of energy when it is mixed with matter in a safe environment
05Dark92Enigma: well its still a fuel
05so you got me on a technicallity
maybe a better question is. why do you put gas in your car if its so flamable?
if i remmeber correctly, they use deuterium and anti hydrogen
so that micheal bay has an excuse
safe, inert things don't usually make a lot of energy when you burn them unfortunately.
TheMaster:it fuels the car
Because we got nothing better to put in it
well you could probably make a coal powered car if you wanted too
They made coal powered ships after all
we could make a hamster poweredcar
but the stored hydrocarbons in coal arn't nearly as good as oil/gasoline
did anypony see CCCP ?
I wonder how vulcan fashion works.
RainBowJack not today.
i hope he comes on
did you notice how she doesnt wear anything under that blanket?
the camera sure did
he PMed me but i was on the little colts room
oh god, phlox is THAT guy
soap opera night on the enterprise?
his face when
I think its movie night
Xindi!
t'pol be trippin
naw, they're just vulkan zombies
fo reals
Nevermind
its BMN far in the future
05fuck me i want another episode
Wrek indeed
i dont mind
was that the last one?
NEXT
Zanon is back from his evil visit with the eyedoctor.
I always thought Enterprise was a tad bit underrated
05ohai
05this episode is meh
Wrek s OC is painting Twilight
we know xD
It took 2 seasons for it to get good but when it was good, it was very good.
Naw hes painting rarity... we all know that.
what was her name?
05engsin sato
maybe we'll have anti-matter stuff. The LHC seems to be doing some good stuff in switzerland
how cool would that be?
05or however you spell it
ensign hoshi sato
anti-matter soon*
Zanon:is raritys skin purple?
05TheMaster: aye im looking forward to see how antimatter takes us one step furtehr
05too bad people consider it a weapon
though I think at the moment they're just trying to figure out how the nuclear forces work
which is cool too
Wrek: just what i was about to say. we all know what happened when they discovered nuclear powe
r
like we need a new, bigger weapon
Wrek: since when was it's existence proved?
Wrek they said the same thing about fussion
fusion bombs are already ridiculous
Well this has put me in a space opera mood. So long Bronies, I have Mass Effect multiplayer grinding to do
now ITER is getting built
TheMaster: they will always try and make a bigger weapon
they've observed anti-matter I believe.
bullets are for pussy anti matter ftw XD
There is always a biggerfish, or in this case a bigger weapon
HWG does not agree.
HWG likes bullet
Did they actually find the god particle? I don't recall whether they'd actually found the higgs-boson or were just getting close to saying for sure
bullets are good but anti matter is best bullet that isnt really a bullet :3
antimater sandvich is best sandvich?
all i know is that afte that day, facebook and twitter were full of religious morons, claiming they had won the god debate becasue of higgs boson
just because they called it the god particle doesn't mean it actually...
Barbetos:no because it will probally kill you xD
oh silly religious people
dumb people. dumb people everywhere
i'm glad hawkings turned out to be right
no black holes wiping out earth
it was super unlikely anyway.
i hope im dead when the sun dies
earth?
are you planning on living for hundreds of billions of years?
Oh you probably will be
Dark_Horst: if God exist he doesn't care about us XD
05earth is a fluke
05but that doesnt mean we should find otehr flukes
05shouldnt*
I don't think its so much a fluke as.
MadSurge:he does care about us i saw a ghost once and im not joking ghosts are very fucking real
Consider how you wouldn't be questioning how unlucky it was that you didn't evolve on a planet that couldn't support life.
We should make the other flukes
sonicandmario85: O__o
its Q
Q is off to an early start.
was Q in this series
is it Q? :3
he must have got bored waiting for picard
no
it was the ghost of my dead cat he was sleeping on the couch and i looked at something and looked back he was gone
no q here
Hallucinations are fun.
well almost looked like Q
Morning, everyone
and my mom felt him walking on her bed and looked and nothing was there
if you consider how ridoncolously big the universe is it makes sense that their would be other planets with life on them.
Morning AttacktheAndalite
i actually could've sworn i saw my dead cat once too. corner of the eye stuff. so when it comes to ghosts, i decide to remain undecided
the question is, how do we find or even get to them
Morning, Barbetos. How're you?
working.
How about you?
i dont believe in ghosts, but i'm also not ruling out the possibility compeltely
Eh....getting breakfast.
TheMaster:yea on NBC news last year nasa discoverd a life planet all coverd with water so theres probally some life living there
05there is a difference between not believing in god or ghosts period.
Wafflllessss
you mean they found a planet that probably had water on it
05and not beleiving in god or ghosts etc untill proven otherwise
theres water on europa
TheMaster:no it all had water on it
(which is a moon in...jupiters orbit)
/me is back (gone 00:07:04)
might be an ocean under the ice
Yes, I think you mean europa
05and where there is water there is a chance for micro organisms
IT WAS A DIFFRENT PLANET NOT JUPITERS FUCKING MOON
god everyone knows about it
sonicandmario85: calm your tits
05oi sonicandmario85
05no allcaps
woah brah. Relax lul
Europa - the futuristic Europe.
Dark_Horst:i dont have tits so i cant calm them
they also found a whole planet consisting completely of diamond
Watch out of the space romans
05also TheMaster.
where did "calm your tits" come from anyway?
05there is no federation yet
05only star fleet
05command
oh okay. I thought that star fleet = the fedeartion
it was one of those lucky images where a planet just happens to cross in front of it's sun jsut at the moment the photo was taken
im not talking about europa it wasnt coverd in ice
later on star fleet is a part of the federation
they did some spectrum alayzing magic on it and discovered that the planet consists of diamond
but they are not equivelant
if it was europa it wouldent be on the fucking news
pretty raw diamond, but still diamond#
i think that europa having ice and water is pretty cool
it happens to be close
relatively close
Allo everypony.
guys they werent talking about europa
who is crabhead there?
Ooh, Enterprise.
Enterprise takes place long before the founding of the federation
they were talking about a planet in another solar system with water on it
Hey everypony, Pluto says Hi
then thats cool too
water seems to be something you sort of need to have life
He is after her booty
Celes_Chere: pluto can go fuck itself
though if you asked water bears they would tell you that they're unkillable super creatures
who don't need water, air, food, sunlight or even not-a-vacuum to live
TheMaster:it also has visible clouds from space like earth does which means it probaly contains life welll life thats designed to be in the water that is..
having a atmosphere is also important but I dunno if that means it has life on it
pizza
Crab head guy made you a pizza.
TheMaster:all a planet needs for life is air water and an atmosphere
and even if it did, i'd be estatic if all you found was grass or the equivelent
and time
lots and lots and lots and lots of time
TheMaster:ever heard of cells? we wouldent have formed without them that doesnt mean other planets dont have them they are the building blocks of life
and you actually need the right mixture of chemicals to somehow, someway form into repeating chains of biological RNA
stalker
Socially awkward crab-head.
I wonder if he replicated spaghetti to fall out of his pockets
star trek version of phantom of the opera *ponyshrug*
lets all shut up about planets and enjoy the fucking movie and think about ponies or whatever XD
hey, it was just a friendly discussion mahn
gotta relax
ik it was
Troll basketball.
lol
05actually
05not a basket ball
Troll sports ball.
handball?
penisball?
05l9ol
05penis
05lololol
looked like a volleyball
I wonder what the repair bill for the enterprise is
because it looks like the ship gets messed up every episode or so
How convienient that the ship happened to pulse and then rupture away from where people are.
brb ima go get something to eat i just got up and i havent even had breakfast yet XD
Medieval Klingon. I bet that was a fun era.
medieval klingons. oh god
are we still watching startreck???
we are
05yeah isnt it great!?
kk... :P
Personally I like Voyager or Next Gen, but Enterprise has it's moments.
medeival klingons? Now I want to watch Hamlet in Klingon
well... i never watched it and i wont start it now :D
TheMaster: Alas poor Yorick, I killed him Horatio.
whether tis nobler in the mind to kill your enemies quickly, or kill them slowly.
as popular as hamlet is I think the Klingons would enjoy the Henry plays more

05makes me want to vote shakespeare in love as movie

Morning everypony.
/me shoots a party cannon into the chat
Morning, VenHur

TheMaster there was a bad hamlet movie

sonicandmario85: All my envy.
I just went into the Random Zone.
its leftover pizza i had last night
pizza i didnt eat
hey wrek. Do you have episodes of the twilight zone?
05i had on my old media storage
sonicandmario85: It's still pizza.
NO! NOT TWILIGHT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!
Twilight Zone
The Twilight Zone. You dingbat.

Alien-zoned.
My favorite TZ ep is the obsolete librarian

Twilight Zone <3
05xeno-zoned sounds better
Morning, Meanwhile.
TheMaster: an*
TheMaster: Love the original series, the 50s one, not the 1985/2002 revival.
Evening AttacktheAndalite.
Wrek:i baked you a pie
Hello Meanwhile and AttacktheAndalite!
Allo MadSurge.
Hai MadSurge
05sonicandmario85: how redundant seeing as you are probably multiple countries away
00,10oh wrek is streaming enterprise now?
05Sumica
Sumica: yep
05yeah i had to show the good part of it
05isntead of the lousy season 1 and 2
You mean season 3?
Wrek:havent you seen asdfmovie? its a quote form it
00,10good I can remove it then. =p
from*
I wonder if they're going to do more overt star-trek references in season 3
05sonicandmario85: i know where you referenced from
05but i have no intention of giving you the privilege of my aknowledgement
They did starwars/triumph of the will references.
As bad as the first 2 seasons were, I was always sad that ot got cancelled just as it was getting really good
*it
Guy 1: i baked you a pie Guy 2:Oh Boy What Flavor Guy 1:PIE FLAVOR!
05we know sonicandmario85
Did you know spaces help?
:>
asdf is old and unfunny imo
tomska made the 5th one last year..
oh god the cg
swearing? In my star trek?
I liked asdf, before everyone and their grandma started quoting it.
Even the costumes are CGI
Meanwhile: Agreed
My dad is the trekkie of the house, I've always been more about horror
whats asdf?
asdfmovie
Halo before Halo was Halo.

TheMaster:search it on youtube
so...counterstrike?
whats this ?... do i spy some ST:Enterprise
05you complain about the cg
05yet its good for its time
oh a youtube series
05meh
also morning everypony
Wrek: aye
Oh my god, it's the Enterprise!
Spectrum_Rush: you spy correctly!
...Don't tell me. We're watching Star Trek, arent we?
How can we answer that if you don't want to be told?
eeyup
05why are you acting like its taboo VenHur? its not like we are watchign a girls cartoon about pastel ponies
Wrek: When was this made?
:'( crabman never got her in bed
I bet hardcore trekkies are happy about mlp
Wrek do you have any Voyager eps?
never knew you liked star trek Wrek
now they're the 'in culture' fanbase
05it premiered season 1 o 2001
bronies, being the new trekkies
Oh my god, Wrek pinged me...my dream has been achieved.
Serenity = 2001-2005
It's a Trap
VenHur: Not that big of a deal :S
I bet she wouldn't be so against it if the alien was hot
Too bad he looks like a seafood medley.
Just so you know, I'm a newbie fan of Star Trek, only seen the movies, ironic how the odd movies got the lowest box office successes.
he should have just projected himself as being attractive from the get-go
05VenHur: you still didnt answer my question
dat guy REALLY doesnt take rejection

Nobody likes a creeper crab-head.

Oh, sorry Wrek, I don't really know what's Taboo is though, some sort of fictional planet?

This is gonna be interesting.
Can you blame him we all want to keep a Japanese girl in our basement

wut
I joined on a Star Trek episode/10
I kinda wish the next step of this franchise would be a new crew farther into the future. I love where Abrams went with the series but I really want it to be progressive and in television format again.
Spectrum_Rush: Zug zug?
00,10dvds eh?
05mhmmm
OK, brb......gotta go to my house......
but the abrams movies set them at the very beginning
with the least technology. The enterprise got wrekced by a mining ship
Meanwhile: Dabu?
Jmo4267: Work work.
Which is why I want to go back to the future
Meanwhile: Lok'tar
Jmo4267: Ogar.
TheMaster: a mining ship that was significantly altered by re-engineered borg technology
best intro ever
I got nothin' else. d:
wait what. When did they say that in the movie?
The only TV fix I have for space opera now is Battle Star Galactica and everything from that franchise post final season has been pretty much shit
I don't know...the intro looks like the weakest of the franchise...
I doesn't even has a badass fanfare tune in it, just some singer...
TheMaster: its in supplemental materials, but its considered canon by paramount
*it
they just needed a less...sitcomy song
and its ashame they had a more fitting song

huh. The ship didn't look much like it had borgy stuff on it
00,10I whould sent you all the TNG and Voyager eps wrek.
Wrek: I remember that game.
05i have the DVD boxes of those aswell
"Life on the Enterprise", starring That Guy From Quantum Leap
I love the intro. The optimistic and uplifting nature fits the placement of the series
05heck i have the VHS collection of voyager
that is elder-god level trolling
wrek that is both evil and awesome
Wrek: can we assume you have every series season and movies?
05nope
00,10lol vhs
Only the good ones? :D
did Wrath of Khan ever get picked as a movie night?
o rly? wathcha missing Wrek ?
because that is easily one of the best movies i've ever seen, even outside of star trek
05only TNG, voyager, DS9, and this one for the series. but i own all the movies
00,10no trek has ever been voted or picked
Greetings, and welcome to Ask That Guy From Quantum Leap. (sorry, I just has to.)
Sumica: I still have my old VHS around :D
Wrek: ah so no TOS or TAS?
00,10so do I
The only movies worth watching in my opinion is Wrath of Khan, FIrst Contact, and 2009
00,10I used it to record pony
Needs more Voyager.
Khaaaan!
05first contact is my favorite star trek movie
^
05but i didnt mind nemesis
05even if people disliked it
00,10first contact was good
:D
Nemesis was okay but I wouldn't have gone out of my way to see it
Is that the one that at one point involves Borg being shot with a tommy gun?
05Spectrum_Rush: im afraid the abverations doesnt ring a bell, can you spell them out?
I only seen some Star Trek movie, and I'll tell you.
Meanwhile: yus
I'm very tempted to linkt ot he plinkett reviews
00,10Voyager needed a movie
I like that one.
Sumica it did have a rather awesome ending
Now, the first one was a big hype when it first cames out, NOBODY would of expected a Star Trek movie, NOBODY.
Wrek: The Original series or The Animated series
05yeah Sumica, the season 7 finale was more than i could have asked :P
00,10yeah but just think of the ending if it got a movie
05never owned the sets but i used to have some VHS tapes with episodes recorded on them
Voyager ended well imo.
05true
The only Star Trek finale that sucked I thought was sadly the finale to Enterprise
...Altough the movie was...disapointing, there's not a lot of action (damn you Enterprise scene.), the characters looked sort of bland, etc.
ah the good ol days of vhs to tv recording
00,10oh this is enterprise after they got the Makos.
05you mean TNG or this one?
This series
The TNG finale was excellent
05well it ended in theory 3 seasons too fast
^
05so the "ending" wanst the proper ending
It wasn't their fault but it unfortunately is what it is
So Star Trek I: The Motion Picture was really bad, and Trekkies feared the next movie (II) was about to be even worse.
hello everypony

Sumica: its as if he was designed by tetsuya nomura :S
and hi VenHur :)
If that logic works, he's a benevolent hero. If it backfires, he's a dumbass
what are we watching?
Star Trek
which generation?
Enterprise
Angry monkey is angry.
got told, son
Moo
liek a baws
hi Lil_B
hi somepony_else :)
I only ever watched the next generation and the few voyager episodes that had Q in them
What would be this?
Wrek do you have a Q episode from the next generation?
00,10startrek, 400years before TNG
05all of them
Hello Lil_B! :)
ohai MadSurge ;)
please show one Q epi
PLZ
star trek deep space 9?
show the voyager Q episode where they ... erm ... "mate" if you can call it that XD
Q mating? Ewwww
That episode is funny.
051 episode left on this disc
05and its appropriatley named twilight :D
05xD
MadSurge it funny, the Qs fight each other dressed like the soldiers from the civil war
:p
Q Continuum civil war is best civil war.
Ohai Rain! :)
Wrek: ooh one of my favorites
hi Rain :)
dat Wrek taking a smoke break
We watching Twilight
00,10oh this one
Nice reaction.
Face punch!
Twilight (Sparkle)
"I have orders to keep you here." Yeah well fuck that, PUNCH.
Dude...
welll... happens... i guess
Oh shit! :O
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
p-p-p-p-p-planet busted
well that was...slightly disturbing to watch
00,10this intro is faster then I recall
death star ripoff...
what we watching
Giant buckyball of death!
05yeah after the 2nd season they made the itnro "hip"
05thoguh i personally preffered the season 1 intro
00,10guess they never changed it when I watched it on tv
Adam = Star Trek Enterprise
Thing is if you know anything about Star Trek prior to this series it's not a particularly credible threat.
for the "cewl" kidz?
thanks Riders
hai everypony, how you doing? :$
hai Michael :)
hey Michael !
never really watched Star Trek before
/me hugs MegaMoonShine Lil_B
05actually a good episode
all i know is KAHN
how you doing Michael
I prefer the more upbeat tone of the season 3 and 4 intro
huh, delta radiation is high-energy electrons
alexxm: good, you?
i'm good Michael
00,10I am disapointed they never once did any calback humor to Quantium Leap
seems like someone tried to enter this chat, with my name :|
Oh shit, Captain Archer made a Quantum Leap
T'pol with long hair... that is my fetish :3
i loved quantium leap
lol, star trek?
05lol, Michael? why are you here? lol
that didnt feel good
Wrek: what?
anypony want some mtn dew?
05sure ill have some
Adam whyts mtn dew?
20 degrees at warp speed?
here you go nice and cold Wrek
05neat
that would cause some SERIOUS latitudinal stress
05well technically there is no "motioN" during warp speed
if not tear the ship apart
05not in the same matter
Lil_B: its a soda drink
00,10not much of a strcutral support if it just falls off
Adam whyt doe it taste like?
05its basically the warp bubble moving the sapce inside the ship to a destination
05or am i wrong?
Wrek: you would be...
right
00,10kinda wrek.
Lil_B: i dont lemon and lime but not sour
WHAT is that thing
05well never bothered lookign it up
05please explain
Adam ok :/ maybe I'll find it somehwere around here
dem scanners
00,10warp is kinda like falling through space
oh no not the Hippocampus oh god the humanity he needs brain surgery or something
wtf
Inb4 he's given them that before.
05so while turnign 20 degrees could effect the destination os stabilities
i watched some 2005 Dr.Who lately
fusion drive with Anit-mater and matter colent
00,10So basicly it gave him altimsers
05i dont think it would cause andy hull stress
05not in that matter atleast
i need to find the older version though
Andy Hull is stressed.
He needs to relax more.
hai :3
hai Derpy_at_work :p
05Sumica: aye
Morning everypony! How are all of you?
05and i got confused there
05was i right or wrong?
05probably a language failiure on my part
hi Crono_brony
good Crono_brony
hai Crono_brony i'm good :)
That's great to hear! ^ ^
00,10there would only be stress from radical corse changes as they still have inertia
how are you Crono_brony
Morning Crono_brony
Adam: Feeling great! never better!
that's good
interspacial flux ... I love it
Morning Crono_brony :)
lol
how are ya, moonshine?
and the black guy is dead :/
whats going on? (ihave no idea
dem aliens
Pretty good Crono_brony
00,10fail crewman
That's great!
Dat Hammer
05killed by liberty
a STICK ?
dem enterprise :D
Kaboom
05sumica
00,10only disabled?
05we should write that down
05ocne gusn of icarus gets boarding
05that would be a viable tactic
00,10raming?
00,10aye
Wrek: The first thing we should do is take you off the wheel.
00,10we kinda did that the other night
05well Meanwhile you gotta admit my driving isnt that bad
00,10I used the tail harpoon and draged one enemy in to another
Flying into clipping issues is not a valid strategy!
05when the lag and stuff isnt in the way
00,10we already lost the match but we got 2 kills
I wonder how long before mortars get nerfed.
how about they switched most of their power to the engine and warp generator thingy
are you talking about BF3?
>.>
HAHAHA BF3.
bye bye everypony
be back later
bye RainBowJack
Later RainBowJack :)
bye RainBowJack
Cya RainBowJack
00,10they need both of those pylon things to make a stable warp field
humans go bye bye
bye RainBowJack
wh cant i hold all these feels
00,10with out it the buble would hae parts of the ship movie at diffrent speeds.
i missed the first half of this episode, whats going on?
In other words... THIS IS CETI ALPHA 5!!
5th planet of Ceti Alpha System? now where have we heard of that planet before :S
05they are called gondola
05;O
Sumica they can create one but at higher speeds, but it collapses under strain at higher speeds
i have no idea what's going on im glad i changed my name dur Chitti Chitti Bang Bang because i would do it now anyway
05well
hence why they could still high 1.7 with only one necelle
05the term higher speeds doesnt really apply to warp
Live long and prosper.
what is that
thing
05basically the time it takes for the warp bubble to transport the mass
human?
05not really speed
05in the same manner as a car accelerates
Warp 9.975. Voyager's average cruising speed, if I recall.
Warp is so yesterday, in Hipser galaxy we use Patanoster
05becasue warp 10 would make you jump galaxies
00,10they cant hold the speed for long
Meanwhile yup
Wrek: or turn into a frog :S
05hehe
05did we ever get to know more about warp 10 beyond the TNG episode?
According to Star Trek physics, reaching warp 10 means you will occupy every point in the universe simulaneously.
00,10Voyager had it
though they do create 2 alternative forms, the quantum slipstream, and the delta-flyers (cant remember the name) one which hits warp 10
00,10but then voyager puled out transwarp
Wrek yes, the delta flyer hits warp 10
05well yeah
and then goes all creepy looking
Chrysalis: Quantom Slipstream?... that sounds like an STO referance
oh, hi Chrysalis
00,10STO takes place after Voyager
what is going on im confused
Quantum slipstream was in Voyager.
Sumica: about 30 years after nemesis
boo
STO takes place at like star date almost 1000000
05been a while since i viewed all of voyager
05i recall an ordeal about omega particles/space/etc
Adam I think the capitain looses his memory every few hours or so... can't follow it myself though :/
05what was that about?
Wrek: The Omega Directive.
i'd have to laod it up to check, but yeah. its after anything thats been shown on tvb
i need to watch voyager again, can't remember half thia stuff
the borg have the Transwarp thing as well, though they do have reletivety issues
thank Lil_B at least im not alone
Wrek: they were super powerful and unstable and could probably destroy the univers or something like that
lol
05yeah i recall something simmilar
The Omega particle, a molecule with incredibly high energy output and instability was detected in the Delta Quadrant and according to Star Fleet orders Voyager moved to intercept and destroy.
^
Meanwhile 7 of 9 also creates a chamber to stabilise the molecule
is this a movie episode special or what?
05no
Indeed, because Omega represents the Borg ideal of perfection in it's complexity.
05all episodes are 40 minutes
I found a song that Gigabit MUSt love. <3
thanks Wrek
Sting - Shape of My Heart Just found this classic.
wow dat is a long episodes
hi Vordox :)
hai Vordox
Hi Lil_B =3 How's spriting?
Yo Michael
Omega, the Borg holy grail.
wow i just realized movie night is on my Birthday
Meanwhile well it is there representation of perfection
Chrysalis: You mean like I said in my last comment? :P
Vordox the SB64 Sprite now finished, he likes the version i showed him
so much omega talk
05thanks for the refresher
we completely ignored the protocol :P
omega?
Lil_B: Already animate out? Nice!
what ep is this?
Vordox no, no animation, only the sprite
First rule of Omega club, don't talk about Omega club.
Oh
Lil_B: Show me!
Meanwhile: ya already broke the rule then
05this is S3EP8

00,10this ep wrek. it never happend
Sumica: Oh you mean the episodes where temporal flimflam makes the whole thing redundant?
00,10yeah
god year of hell
05oh now i get it
I hated those too.
what Meanwhile said Rain
i always feel bad for the crew in those eps
Wibbley wobbley timey wimey.
So, my cat brought in this fella http://i.imgur.com/9vPED.jpg
Sumica: my dad is watching Voyager right now
Spectrum_Rush, what?
Jim: Aww, birdy.
Jim: lolwut
dat leadership
KAHN! is that coming up soon
Noone here loved Leon? D:
Jim: awww mean kitty :(
they really DONT like that right necelle
thats the same one they lost earlier
05aye
OH SHIT :O
well theyre dead
DED
Nobody likes necelles in Star Trek.
Rain: A for effort, is all, don't mind me i'm just a nerd
if i recall its also the one voyagers takes alot of damage to
Meanwhile of course, they lose warp drive
:O
Exacta.
omg
Nooooooooooo!!
SHOOT THEM
00,10and that is why you dont put the bloody bridge on top
well that can't be good
Well, looks like the voyager is aout to get molested and destroyed
wow people, its been too long
Not sure about the molested bit, buy mrh
05that isnt the voyager
05,,,
It was still alive when I took the picture, but the bird passed away only a few minutes later.
05...
Ohai stallion1
ded
Sumica they do build ships later on with a reserve bridge
hai stallion1
Hello stallion1 :)
Wrek: (Isn't really a star trek fan, let me get things wrong in piece, okay)
and seperation capabilities
do they do learn
but a LONG time from now
Jim: :'(
And I can hardly type rom this proportional angle
We've lost the port necelle we're venting plasma the shields are down there's a hull breach from decks 1 to 7 our phasers are overloading the torpedo tubes are locked up and the microwave is broke.
Chrysalis: only 1 hundred years :S
00,10back up bridges. are pointless if the primary crew just got spaced
05i dont blame ya
And now the damage report machine is damaged.
Sumica ECH
Meanwhile: dat arson murder and jaywalking
abandon ship?
whats up! awesome peoples, b ut ill only be here for a few, but do not fret. I will be getting a laptop soon soooo bo-yea
sneak attack critical for extra damage
00,10put primary bridge in the center of the hull and you dont have the problem of it ggeting cut open
buyt then how do you get the "hole in the bridge ramming speed" shots
^
like where janeway destroys the time ship
Chrysalis: "Time's...up."
00,10this is just a hey we can put clips of every one dieing in the advertisment and realy get alot of people watching
or when Picard rams the enterprise into the scimitar
everyone else takes 1 shot to die
05USS Defiant is best federation vessel
archer takes 3
nuuuuu
He ded
Wrek: in a mirror darkly?
05hehe
WHATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
/me back in time...
boom
inb4 he remembers the future
wtf just happened?
Before newcomers get up in arms, It was not all just a dream
00,10TV trope: it was all just a dream
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED was he sleeping or what
Sumica this wasnt a dream, its an alternate timeline
But it never happened, so how would he remember it?
Wrek: wait the onr from Ds9 or from the original series?
He had temporal parasites in his brain.
00,10was it?
Because of their existence that stuff all happened.
lol
they destroyed something that doesn't follow the rules of time
05well i was first reffereing the DS9 one
YOWCH
Howdy y'all!
05but then you mentioned it so xD
But when they were destroyed they became non-existent and so having never existed that stuff never happened.
The Parasites were displaced in time. Archer finished the removal procedure in the future, which destroyed them in the past, meaning the timeline has now diverged
Hai Everlasting_Joy :)
ah XD
hai Everlasting_Joy :)
Allo Everlasting_Joy.
ello
Hey Everlasting_Joy
Ohai Everlasting_Joy!

Good thinking there Pamela.
Why do they never jump to the side?

In retrospect, trying to escape from the remote-controlled car by climbing up something that the car could easily plow through at it's momentum was a stupid thing to do.
2 million in 2-dollar bills?
dat coin
2 million in two dollar bills.
2 mil in $2 bills?
But....why? You'd never be able to use them. XD
KO

What is it with chat and Taco Bell recently? lol
FYI $2 are legal tender in the US
why dosent any villan just shoot him in the face
erm... Batman had the belt in the next shot right after it got removed...

And screw G2, G3, and G3.5.

Shizuka: dem UFO

Spike gained some weight.
oh my God, G1
spike is reeaally annoying

I cannot take any more.

Firefly is best pony
:O
speaking of which, how the heck did Firefly get to the real worls?
Quick, ride the talking flying pony.
FUN FACT! Rainbow Dash was based off of Fire Fly
You know, just cause.
Dken2021: She really REALLY flied
Dken2021: Magic
See ya later TJ
Well, the difference between G3 and this is that STORY happens here, and not in G3
SUICIDE for kids
Riding skill increased to 225
Song time.

Deal with it.
Yeah o course Firefly is best G1 pony since she's the basisi for RD
SINGING!!
Michael, ikr?
First use of ponyfeathers?
Michael: Yes plz

Yeah, I would freak out too if I was raised in the 80s and was higly drugged up to see a talking pony, now in the 2010s, that's another story...
:o
I wanna see Meghan in MLP FIM
Michael: Honestly i would say this is a fine exception
But I know it's an impossibility
a lil off key
killerpony7733: i know but no in G4

A legit Lol
Thrackerzod thaty we are
^
there IS a human in the MLP S2 Intro :P
Thrackerzod, here
Michael: Can't say that unless they try. You never know if the writers could make it work
Lil_B: Woot?
Why can't you believe? You're talking to a flying horse!
Or a G1/G4 movie
If S3 is really going to be 13 episodes, that would be the only justification.
I believe in magic
Lil_B: I'm not sure if Madame Foster counts as human. She's STRANGE.
Yes JESmith71!
Cypresswolf, a flying pink horse talking with flashes on her butt
lawl seen that. :D
I wonder what kind of drugs Megan is on that makes a flying talking pink pony not that strange.
Vordox look closly in the train at the beginning, there is madame foster :P
:D
Uh, guys, imagine a tribute to this episode when the Mane 6 finds a well and visit the human world.
Dragonborn save us!
Clopp'd!

Straisin: This is G1 Where ALL MLP came from
You know, for kids.
Gee, I dunno
da power of darkness!!
is that Lauren at the middle?
G1 = Alright, G2 = Game, G3 = GAH, G4 = Godly
You know, if you can survive the annoying character of Spike, and the terrible songs in the series, then this would of been a decent generation.
darkneesssss
Vordox: The other G's has comical effect for me honestly it's funny to watch something that bad
Hey its Sven
Straisin: This was the FIRST EVER MLP film.
ember run!!!
VenHur: it WAS a decent
We need a G1/G4 movie
Heads...gonna roll
Anyone agree

Pirtates argggh
WOW This is so intense
YARR
Oh, this again? :3
So hardcore
Pirates life is the life for me.
Seaponies are magic.

Imagine seeing the villains from the pilot in Season 3...DO WANT!
Cypresswolf: thay're narwhals. unicorns of the sea

SCORPAN I WANT IN G4!
why does everypony think this is G4? G4 has better animation than this

Dken2021: Um... no.
Scorpan to the RESCUES!
so dragons are evil?
Grab'd
[Alpha] spike not :3
If Scorpan killed the original Applejack, chance's are you'll cause a time paradox in Equestria!
Keep in mind that most of the elements of G1 belong to Marvel. All that we can be sure of that didn't are Applejack and Spike.
they look like Zelda Moblins
FOOOOR KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
I wonder what Applejack's gonna tell Applebloom
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Star Trek Fandom. I was THERE... for the original broadcast. Pre net. Pre intyerweb. When fanzines were PHYSICAL. Old times.
Hat, all the popular shows. Frankly, I doubt there would be much of a chance that Dennou Coil would get streamed on here. But that's one of those underrated anime.
00,10I kinda wonder what older gen collecters think about bronys
mohawk! the mohawk!
Kencolt: Yeah but MLP had HOW many viewings compared to Star Trek? =P
60 billion double dollars

Okay. Thanks for telling me Nittany. Looks like I'll have to change my plans and do what I was going to do on Thursday then. I'm planning on seeing Batman and going out to dinner one night, which means I'd miss most of the first movie. If it was Indy first, I was going to do it Wenesday so since I'd just be missing Last Crusade. I don't want to miss Pirates though, so I'll just do all that Thursday instead

13do not know who this ed person you are talking about it
NINJA MODE ACTIVATE!!*disappears*
an artificial sattelite?
I didn't.
Guys, Wrek never saw this before, so Ed's gender is a spoiler.

EMPU!

I'm guessing MPU
Cookie! :)
Shizuka: LOL
those earthlings are wierd nuff said
Inb4 Pyoko
Nittany_Discord: Ed is a girl. Ed is an anomaly. Ed is Japan's Answer to Pinkie. But most of all.. Ed id Ed.
thanks
I get it. :3
what is the difference between normal and an artificial sattelite?

Lawl Wrek
a Moon isnt a satellite its a moon trolol

As I said.

matthias not a movie. It's a Cowboy Bebop episode
nuff sadi
A character should be judged on how much they contribute to the various stories they are in. Ed just sits at her computer and...acts "kawaii" or whatever. not a very interisting character.
Why Ed is awesome, cause it's Ed <3
okay
ARF
:D
ED, Edd, and eddy anyone remember dat?
No one okay
ed id ed id ed id ed

AttacktheAndalite he still has childhood innocence
that was retarded
I told you it's a terrible episode.

Vordox: basically the death of a baby
and this is why i hate clowns
dats messed up

00,10I can speak every language but greek, but it's all greek to me.
heh
with exceptions like this episode this show will mess with your mind
Ching chenk blah blah blah xD
this episode reminds me of rainbow factory. the last person you thought you would feel sorry for, you suddenly do. in this case. the man with a childs mind. in rainbow factory's case, rainbow dash.
I love the first episdoe
Vordox: I wouldn't call the condition bucked up. It's a mutation yes but it usually results in a unique pattern in your eyes and only unique to you. It's more or less a lucky thing to have
naww, it's pretty grounded.
Sumi bet you cant speak Latin
there is minimal mind-fuckery.
killerpony7733: O.o
Yay!!!
which is better trigun or cowboy bebop i feel like trigun for me
00,10now for some space truckers
cowboy bebop, again?
killerpony7733: But... Every colour except brown and it's colours(This includes Red)
killerpony7733: And yes, my eyes have "weird strings" in them
The intro is pretty confusing
Vordox: Aaaah. I see again i'm just speaking for myself here.
later everypony, gotta go dinner :D
yes!<
bye Michael
Bye Michael
When does this series end anyway?
killerpony7733: No I mean...
I remember when my friend bought "Boogie-Pop Phantom" years ago...it was so hard convincing him that it was garbage.
the music in the intro reminds me of TF2
killerpony7733: It's like a flower petal type of strings around my pupil
i like that every episode of cowboy bebop has a differnet genre of music. like jazz for one then rock
whats boogie pop phantom
woo the heavy metal one~
What kind of condition is that, killerpony7733 ? O:o
No,Heavy weapons guy.
killerpony7733: Oh and don't misunderstand, what I meant it has every colour = It's the mix of that colour
:O :O :O
Vordox: Heck if i know. Never heard of the pattern or what
I'm not sure myself. Pointless unentertaining anime that tries way too hard...

Shizuka: That's terrible. :<
whats this anime?
Train of Concequences. ever heard that song?
WTF
SPIKE YOU CRAZY BASTARD
Shizuka: D:
That doesn't work in reality but who cares?
That's not how VACUUM WORKS
the rovers will never know peace from their endless wandering, forever praying for a death that will never embrace them
Nuuuuu
TrAJECTORY Non ravity
Gravity*
if you do stuff fast enough, you might survive the low pressure.
i really doubt he would be concious long enough for that
Mmmmm crispy ham
or have eyes
Wasson: I thnk it's 20-30 seconds :P
http://xkcd.com/1086/ He wishes for a pony ^^
hitchhikers guide says 35
i never beleived that
yeah roughly...I wonder if your acclamated to a lower pressure environment if could help you cope..?
hiya guys
Wife gonna truck
but survivable is not the same as unharmed
dat cat
is fat
I think you can be concience for like 15 seconds...then you pass out. If you get back into a pressurized environment within a minute, you'll be okay.
oh yeah space exposure?
Wasson: Lawl, space exposure?
Space is not a material
:P
that's what happens in no atmosphere at absolute zero
That was for otakon
what do you mean?
you are exposed in space
thus space exposure
it does take some time for the gasses to boil-out of your blood.
It's a technicality I'm laughing at otakon
-__-
welp anyway I might miss movie night tonight
It's like saying Space is something when it's not :P
when they were testing space suits for the moon landing, there was an incidnet in a vacuume chamger where a dude passed out.
05what is Meanwhile doign on mars!?
my mom might call me up to the bar to help her out with the work.
Wasson: I remember that
Wrek: His moustache led him there
he is braking the fourth wall
Waltz For Venus is ;_;
screw spelling
So Mica...
what trilogie is this week?
Mica Trigun
http://fav.me/d5a619f
antoher good ep*
Thank you! =3
Celestia Ponytailed
Trigun?
yes trigun
oh look Trigun!
05i sure love me some longcoats
which REALLY needs a touch up
Hey look, it's me.
HAI ME
Trigun was one of those series that was awesome/funny/awesome/repeat
Wrek: Keep practicing drawing it.
best opening
the age shows in the animation greatly
Hi everypony
hiya Brony
otakon: DO NOT TOUCH TRIGUN
EVER
hoi Brony
Let the OLD relics of masterpieces of the past BE
Vordox: it needs BR treatment
Vordox: HD remaster
Oh
all the love and peace stuff.
That's fine then :P
No 3D though please
Hey, what movies are tonight?
is this ep.. 5(?)
Vordox: no 3D, just touch ups
Obsidian: it's Indiana Jones and....
I'm not sure
So Sumica: since you like Trigin, have you seen the FULL Story of the manga or only the shortcoming of he anime?
yup
00,10I dont know I would like to see trigun come out like redline
It's a me! Mario!
:D
whats a yar?
that's a lot of graves
not this episode, the next one is kickass (I think) the one with the brothers
the thing that bugs me about Trigun is the...inherent goofiness of alot of the "enemies".
yay milly!
not her again
wow how old is this anime?
otakon: Milly = The tall girl?
looks old
Vordox: eeyup
hai, i'm back :)
I mean, would it really have been so hard to make them a little less "comic book"
