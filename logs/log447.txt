Another question
:D
Nabronyan: YES
My pleasure, GilDash. :)
Lil_B whoa lol
Ninjazz|Work: You are infected.
cachi01: We're going too far with this. I'll just shorten it to "Rarity is best pony", there fixed.
When I joined the chatroom, it asked me for my desired Nickname
Will that be saved?
Nabronyan: if you want it too
Om: Everything in moderaton.
Yes.
pikorar: lol
Nabronyan: yes, it will ^^
pikorar: That's not how you spell Rainbow Dash. :p
pikorar *cough*Twilight*cough*
Ninjazz|Work: i see what you did there.
Nabronyan: type in /nick *your username* and a password
There doesn't exist "best pony". Only "favorite pony" And that is the end of this argument.
Om: Ain't I clever? :$
Invi, are you sick? Sounds like you got a case of the "U MAD"
Nabronyan: not exactly...well u can change it whenever u want and no password is needeed to use it...
Radu: /) i agree
Ninjazz|Work: Very, cleaver.
Bronysith: (\

otakon: i have my picture with him as my facebook profile
CeilingKirz: 5 bucks says he tries to evade
not the fic itself but yeah he was warned
Ninjazz|Work: Is that right? Splash with holy water
Invi: good thing I'm a fan of both eh? :D
Okay, everytime I'm entering into a room, I'll be looking at the ceiling, because I might see Kirz!:D
Om: Might not be enough.

!touhou
Aurora, you are 4Heida no Akyuu.
DEMON SOULS
Wrek: that was an excellent game
FUCK THAT GAME MAN
1,3WoW's biggest difficulty is finding 9 other people that don't suck and can follow directions so you can raid
05i loved it
Nabronyan: i beat it
im reading the fic right now..
Can't get past the first level <:'c

05bronysith
Ninjazz|Work: all u can do is warn em lol

WHY CAN'T DEMON SOULS HAVE A EASY DIFFICULTY
MahBoi777: And they never hear me.
So you saw cata content. Heroic?
heya, all
Nabronyan cause reasons
05lets play some D3 once the rest of the raid realizes that throne of the 4 winds HC will slaughter us.
Nabronyan: it does, it just too hard
Nabronyan: because Atlus
Nabronyan: it is easy. if you play it right "Cough" cheat "Cough"
A game is good if the easy difficulty is hard
I SHAL brb
Ninjazz|Work: then may Sumerpan have mercy on their souls

Cheat? I would never!
lol
men.....
ok then lol
Royal Blue is the BEST COLOUR EVER!
/me Looks for Demon Souls cheats
1,3we raided 10m, so we were 5/12 heroic when we all stopped playing I think
05only game i find myself cheating in is skyrim.
05oh fuck stuck in a door
I just made my own pony via pony creator
ded chat?
1,3because the gap between 10m normal and heroic > 25m normal/heroic
Woo hoo! I just got back from the flea market!
I feel special :D
05oh fuck jumped down this ledge and cant be assed to run aorund
I got FOUR new games! :D
Stop talking like there's a stream going on! You're confusing me!

nah not ded
05so on so forth
Nabronyan: Where can you create your own pony?:O
Spyro: A Hero's Tale, Crash Bandicoot: Wrath of Cortex, Sonic 3D Blast, and Ristar!
Only cheat I put in skyrim is putting the Pinkie set
the only reason why i don't play wow it because i'm to lazy to reach max lvl
:D
05Bronysith did you add my battletag?
cause being a serial murder with a mask like that is hilarious
Thanks Nabronyan :D

05ia sked if you added my battletag Bronysith
1,3in 25m there's always been room to carry part of the group if you had to, 10m gets tuned a lot tighter, and at least in the first tier of cata, a few of those heroics were bugged or near impossible for the first few months
Wrek: what is it again lol

...why?
dat bacon
k sorry it just make me rly angry and i want it to be blocked
so hey guys :3
11,02Kipkat07_Mare: I'm so sorry that happened, but just going outside isn't always going to get you arrested. You hung out with some real jackasses and got the bad side of things. I'm sorry your mother made you do that, but you should tell her what happened and that you need to have her consider your judgements as much as her own. I would have cried possibly too if I was arrested for
11,2something I didn't do, but it wasn't that big of a crime or anything so you don't really have to worry too bad about it. Just keep in mind that there are jerks out there in the real world and you need to know who they are and avoid them whenever possible.
Slurry requested it for while they are on vacation
that's a lot of bacon ScootaChicken
Dat Dr. SuperBrony64.

FlareChaser: system crash, they only said it 12 times now.

Megabyte started a new viral movement disguised as a regular binome.
Herr Doktor.
HERR DOKTOR?
Nittany_Discord: we all know you arent ^^
Pegasus: It's perfectly okay for a female fan of the show to call herself a brony. Some prefer Pegasister, which is also cool. And if for some reason a male fan wanted to call himself a pegasister, that's ok also, if a bit... odd. However, you are NOT allowed to call yourself a bad of dried kampyo. That's right out.
*twiches crazy*
00,03Are you a boy or a girl?

Wat do you mean?
Girl Piwer!
*Power
About wat sweet apple masscare is?
Twilight trolling is discouraged, knock it off.
Thounderstorms :'(
Trolling?
Epic last speach
need keylogger
Wat?
Twilight: We don't speak of that here.....
and suddenly it's like The Thing
1 1 1 errr 1
right now
Its kinda windy out.
Oh you guys dont talk about fanficitons?
No Gore fics or clopping and such things
i just realized how tired i am, and i have school tomarrow :'(
14LOL DRF
14I was watching that
14xD
I agree with their decision to cancel this show at this point.
03LOL I like how they just throw it in the wash by itself
Megaframe.
There not clopping fanficitons
Tovler: what?! why?!
Clopfics are for morons
13aaaaaand that was the end
The series finale ends on a cliffhanger, so I assume Megabyte won
For the hunt
dat series finale cliffhanger
these last shocking words
j/k. WHYYYYYYY?!!
03they should have put it in with a load of clothes
such a troll
Aslo Clopping also is wat a moron will do
Fanfictions are ok depending on content
Goddamn cliffhanger.
CLIFFHANGER!
well, there's a webcomic, but...
GODDAMMIT!

...which we will never ever see
i mean hunt....

13and of course the disappointment is there is no more
RustyMeat: This is the series finale
lol
Yeah the Webcomic totally skips that.
DAMN YOU PEOPLE WHO CANCELED THIS!
the end
When did this come out?
I know
Shizuka: did it got cancelled?
13there's a movie in development hell
There's no answer to what just happened.
Shizuka: it hurts, it HURTS!
By the way a video talked about the dangers of clopping
And this is why you don't end on a cliffhanger
DaringDude: you said a bad word!
Shizuka...it's not the same
well not alery
psh never
Tony Jay....
Ever
14it's not a fair comparison though
But still
13yep
CK|Ded: they canceled it AFTER the cliffhanger sadly
I hate cliffhangers.
14a normal DVD game is 4-8GB
SHizuka Development hell... a fate worse than death
08,01Shizuka: wait, that was the last of it?
:(
yes
otakon: And this is why you don't end on a cliffhanger. Ever.
13yep
14how much can a NES game handle? 2-3 MB?
can we blame Dan Didio for this?
13now for the better ending
/me is now a sad pony

cool
CCCP: HA! I lied I didn't nom on it! I gave them to someppony else!
(draws random ponies)
Ponies47: you know just nevermind lol :)

02why would you treat a disk that bad anyways?
bye otakon
03uh

Om: haha yeah ^^
11,01Who's being drawn?
Wrek: Make it a really suacy full body pic ;)

Derpy x SOaring
EpicPwnTime3: well... sweedish is SEXY
DAWWWW dat Spitfire

03BlueFlare because people get lazy and just leave discs lying around

Wrek: Nope.avi No suit
Wrek: No suit. :3
Wrek: half on half off
Suit off.^^
Actually, No Suit.

Wrek: Suit on body, not on head?
I NEARLY bought a Blu-Ray drive when I heard about the releases of Pokemon 4Ever and Pokemon Heroes: Latios and Latias
(redraws you)
no suit Wrek
Hay, out of the mane 6. who should i try to voice act as? I can't chooose :c
03those two are crappy upscales
Is redrawed
Wrek: OR, WAIT... do like, half on or something... something sexy
but when I found out what they were bundled with I just said "no thanks I would rather pirate them"
(jeans and suit apper on me)
wrek : NO SUI T
03only movies 6 and 7 are true HD LOL
because they were bundled with Hoenn movies
03well Heroes is decent but has the usual horrible colors
02but really, SD is the way to go.
i don't know what you sound like SparklyWaffles so i can't help
03SD?
05sleek "g5" style or as show true as possiboru
02SD cards

Bye bye bye Trixie

if it were not for them being bundled with Hoenn movies I would have bought those on Blu-Ray and a drive for my laptop
Whats that?
I'm a voice actor, I can voice each and everyone of them but I don't know which one.
da fuq?
03flash memory can be more dangerous, because if it breaks, it breaks
CupcakeWarrior: Beats me :(
02they could already be putting movies and games an SD if they wanted.
/me has a headache
Wrek: wasnt G5 like fleur?
05in joke form old ages of bronystate
03if a hard drive breaks, 9 times out of 10, you can recover stuff

Nittany_Discord: You would really wear that?? :D
even though we have played it on different bands
11,01For charity.
FM in your case
AM in mine
Thats awesome, hahaha.
that chatception :)
hai Ponies47 :)
02drf
seen man wear maid costume before two times. very different circumstance. Not want discuss.
Great, now Im gonna have sexy Maid_Discord dreams tonight
11,01I would be embarrassed a hell.
Greetings Michael :P
02are you allowed to play music from video games?
RaveBrony: Okie doki loki! Today I made a Youtube acount for no reason :P
03I'm allowed to play whatever I want
02ah
hai RaveBrony
Hugs Michael
Ponies47: Lol?? :D
although it might not fit the format
of the show that is
Ponies47: How did you do that without making a google account?
/me hugs Ponies47
although its good timing
dance music on a Friday night
RaveBrony: I was borrrrrrred!
/me glomps everypony
Nittany_Discord: Ah wearing a dress isnt that bad... I did it once to get into a convention for free :D My gf at the time was laughing her ass off all day... :D
I wonder what I would look like as a maid
RaveBrony: Free is good, it only cost a change in atire
11,01I'd look ugly.
I'm fine with wearing dresses, I guess. Wanna know why?
02if you can play whatever you want, then you should just play static
02:3
nope
thats illegal
/me hugs Dashie20Percent
Dashie20Percent: Just used my 3rd Email :P. Wen your making a account they let you make A Gmail right on the spot :P
Om: Yep, I had to wear the dress for 30 and greet people :D
02LOL really?
*when
yes
*30 minutes
/me glomps Dashie20Percent
03well, more than a certain amount at least
Someone should draw all of our OCs in maid outfits
11,01RaveBrony: Embarrassing?
RaveBrony: That aint to bad
/me has been lurking
/me would love to secretly dress up as a maid. :$
yes
02why is it illegal? O_o
I forget how much though
hey mario_pony hows your day been
/me glomps Michael
draw ALL the OCs? :(
Nittany_Discord: Nah... Im very secure in my manhood :P Plus my gf was hot :D
03well it's not "illegal" but it goes against FCC policies :P
03because you can't just not have stuff playing
/me uberglomps Dashie20Percent
GilDash: why secretly?
GilDash: Not a secret anymore now is it.
but I am pretty sure part 73 of the FCC rules and regulations should shed some light
/me is a tomboy who would HATE wearing a maid outfut
11,01I see nothing wrong with wearing dresses. Women wear pants nowadays.
Om: No... :D
03hence why our station just plays music from a computer when nobody's hosting a show
My girlfriend has been trying to get me to cosplay as Sora
Is listening to a remix of the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic theme song
CupcakeWarrior: OMG I love Sora!
CupcakeWarrior: Whats wrong with that? Many girls cosplay as Sora :P
Nittany_Discord: oh you :D
alexxm: well i ate a whole box of cereal with half a gallon of milk and now i feel sick so pretty good how about you?
02ah
RaveBrony: Im a guy
:O
/me uberglomps Michael
I am operating myself under part 15
no way!!
WallDives: It's not the kind of thing one admits. :D I'd love to wear it for laughs and see people's expressions. I've got a couple of hawaiin shirts I wear at winter for the same reason. :D
/me thinks a chick in baggy pants is cute tbh >.>
i'm good mario_pony how come you haven't been on lately
RaveBrony: But she does cosplay as Sora
:O :O
ah.
So today I have Fluttershy in my room. And shes so cute! :)
/me is uberglomped
alexxm: videogames, tumblr, and school
hai mario_pony!
ah right mario_pony
but if I used a programmable oscilator instead of a crystal (with no phase noise of course) and had some more filtering my little exciter/transmitter would be legal to drive a power amplifier at a licensed radio station
13 more school days left :O
11,01I just thought maid cosplay for charity would be fun.
05hmm
hi Dken2021!
hai mario_pony
05hows 1: the image so far and 2: the music
hi Michael
Nittany_Discord: Maid cosplay is always fun. :D
crystal control is very reliable
Ponies47: rly?
CupcakeWarrior: Oops, i read that wrong, i thot you said She cosplays as him :P Whats wrong with Sora then? You should totally do it! :)
Nittany_Discord: that would be awesome! I'd totally join
music's ok
and take pics!! :D
It might be entertaining
no matter how long I have the transmitter on for it just WILL NOT DRIFT!
11,01panda: Sounds fun.
Nittany_Discord: though I dont have a maid outfit ^^
RaveBrony: I just dont like cosplay
Michael; Nope.avi
Wrek: I liek it :3

OmegaMetroidBrony: http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4040/randomspitfire.png Shame I couldn't fit in the suit too. :P But as I said, I have 0 skills in art. You could do something the same too. :)
Midnight_Splendor: with no eye protection
Hi Michael and RaveBrony
Just do something, OmegaMetroidBrony, Anything, Make your own "Sketch pony"
When is there going to be a solar eclipse?
because I've been thorugh towns where two of those allegedly are, and I've NEVER, EVER seen them.
Eye protection is for cowards.
^
hi RainbowAsh
Hi CCCP
Vordox: Did you do that??
hi RainbowAsh
soul eater is good..... but it is no where near epic like GURREN LAGANN
RaveBrony: Yeah, Wrek was drawing and I felt the "Itch"
Also hi mario_pony
:)
It's not detailed, it's a fast speed draw. And some details and proportions are crap. <.<
Pinkies4thWall: I have some bad news :'( don't hate me
Vordox: Very nice :)
RaveBrony: You can do better. :P
Theres going to be a solar eclipse here in california starting at 5:24 pst
Dat SuperBrony64|AFK
So what is Wrek drawing?
/me hates being wrong.
It's not "I can't draw" it's "I should try"
Irish_Pony: Spitfire, i think
:( yes PrincessLuna
?
Bronysith what a concidence i'm listening to gurren laganns OST
RaveBrony: Do your own pony while Wrek is drawing. =3
Pinkies4thWall: I'm not a fan of cats :'(!!!!!
alexxm: it is awesome
:O
I want a OC, but i dont have one :'(
PrincessLuna: ^
PrincessLuna: me neither
PrincessLuna: Me neither :P
Irish_Pony: You're not blind! And Spitfire. ;)
CCCP: make one!!
Vordox: Cant... im studying for a test right now... plus, if i draw, its gonna be FlareChaser's drawing he asked me to do :D
CCCP: right nao
Pinkies4thWall: I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!
CCCP: go Go GO!!
i know Bronysith thought it was odd that you'd mention gurren lagann as i was listening to its OST
right now on the hub: The muppets take manehattan
GilDash: After summoning Satan i made a deal with him
mario_pony: but i would like some one that actually knows how to draw draw mine
Cats always look at me like I'm some kinda idiot Like they're so much better than me. I've got opposable thumbs! Can YOU hold a phone? NO. You are a cat. Fuck you. :|
I'm coding in GML for my Game Project, I can spare 10 minutes, even if I have about 50% of the code done in 1 and a half week, and got 3 more days. :P
alexxm: i do have a 6th and7th sense
Irish_Pony: If my soul's on the line, I swear...
GilDash: Dont worry
gotta go practice my sonic rainboom.
Irish_Pony: That doesn't help. :D
Dashie20Percent: may the force be with you

Maid Hour is worst chat hour ever. I long for the days that didn't have it. Also, I DIDN'T SWEAR THAT LAST LINE.
Pony hour doesn't start back up til the fall

/me 11,01dusts Wrek|Obsermaid
08,01imma sleep on you goodnight.
Yes, I fully approve of this music :3
Shamaid: Chat is repetitive because you let it be. It was never "repetitive" back when there wasn't as much people and as much RP.
sleep well
Petrified_Maid: u sicko i was poking her with a unicorn horn i am a alicorn
RP cause repetitiveness. New topics don't.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: How was I supposed to know you were an alicorn?! :O
08,01viking is best bed.
08,01you should all know this by now.
Dermathil: I agree with you on the RP.
11,01RP is discouraged here because it got out of hand once.
<----
Dermathil.....again i see your point but thats what happens when somthing get popular
Suddenly dari
its says in my name Petrified_Maid
I wouldn't know I've never slept on a viking
11,01I try to cap Maid Hour RP.
08,01also, can we get something straight
Maid_Discord: story tiem do tell\
/me wonders how long before Alicorn_Prince_Shane catches on :)
11,01To just very minor stuff.
Petrified_Maid: ?
08,01i'm a pervert for being me
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4729/ Not sure if want...
/me dusts away anything more than dusting
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: See what I mean?
/me 08,01is not really a pervert
no i dont Petrified_Maid
08,01Irish_Pony: you'll drink to anything
Petrified_Maid: just say it
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Exactly
Shamaid: Shouldn't have gotten popular in a place whose RULES say "no excessive RP". Same thing with a certain song about a certain day of the week.
/me has been trolling Alicorn_Prince_Shane from the start :D
Maid_Discord: how much out of hand?
sigh
isnt trolling against the rules Maid_Discord ?
Dermathil: i ment the site...with the more people you get a lot less stabilty and people smart enough to read the rules..
11,01Malicious trolling.
lol k
swaaaaaaaaaaag
11,01mario_pony: Quite. It was going r34.
should change it so ppls no get confused
ppls always get confusled.
Alicorn_Prince_Shane: But confusing people is what I do! :D
It nearly goes r34 almost all the time :/
/me attacks Petrified_Maid with the power of something something
Shamaid: I was around since The founding days. I was around when the non-BMN chat was consisting of 8 people in the morning and as many as 20 on rare occasions in evening. (8 consisting of ME and the mods. YEAH.)
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: dafuq?
08,01OtakuTom: i'm so unperverted, it hurts... my boyfriend. he wants to be intimate, but my sensibilities just won't allow it. he thinks i don't love him anymore, and says i'm not the man he fell in love with. the stress is causing me to question my role in society, and my worth as a human being.
Certain someponies Alicorn_Prince_Shane not me
http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/133687851663.png
half naked twilight desktop background...
Dermathil: and thats good for you....and i honestly could care less...but again when somthing gets popular it becomes harder to contain...
/me 11,01dusts Alicorn_Prince_Shane
08,01MaidWarrior: ssssh! we're not allowed to ship otakon!
why do people find ponies more sexual when they they wear MORE clothes?
Wrek : cheesy pr0n music pls.
/me ships otakon all the time

/me summons PrincessLuna to help
Shamaid: doesn't mean you should stop TRYING to contain. BEAT THE ODDS AND DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.
08,01ChrysaMaid: don't ship Otakon
*cough* Indeed *cough*
cept i do it on xbox so i dont get kicked for it :)
I'd have to guess because they don't normally wear clothes?
Phase4: lol dat comic XD
PinkiePieFTW: Because the imagination makes allure mores. It strange, but lingere more sexy than nekkid often
Dermathil........yeah im good.....;p
Satrun but....we need to ship otokan :'(
08,01he only travels by air
mario_pony: shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Shamaid: doesn't look like it.
/me launches battleship to defend Otakon from ships
OmegaMaidtroidBrony seriously? where
08,01seriously guys, no shipping otakon. he really doesn't like it, and it's now bordering on harassment.
Dermathil: ya sure? cause i've never gone farther than a little dusting
I lost the link ages ago
08,01we love him, but not in *that* way.
ruv. ruv is...
well ill just do something random then....
hmm...
"Love is a battleship"
/me starts a bar fight
ruv is teh pains.

Irish_Pony: Hellyeah!
08,01mario_pony: what gives it away? is it my constant outright stating ofit?
/me throws barstool at Irish_Pony
/me ends bar fight
Damnit Alicorn_Prince_Shane stop killing my income!
Oi!
Petrified_Maid: did you know "Battlefield the movie game" is a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER?
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: LOL
/me punches Petrified_Maid
08,01Ingwaz: the fact remains that i want to love pretty much everyone in *that* way
Dermathil: :O No I didn't! Thank you :)
08,01i see a lot of beauty, everywhere
/me slaps Irish_Pony
/me kicks Petrified_Maid in the groin
/me pours magically whiskeu on Petrified_Maid and Irish_Pony

Wait, THERE'S A TOPIC. "Battleship the Movie Game" is a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. Discuss.

08,01Dermathil: who the fracking frack is going to *buy* that?
Nothing I can do for those poor men
Dermathil: FOOOUUR HOOOOOURRRS
something tells me this guy likes twilight sparkle...
08,01i mean... for fuck's sake... seriously...
Irish_Pony: Maybe not a tuce, but a truce sounds fine ;)
MaidWarrior: IKR
I have heard BS movie was actually WORSE than Transformers 3, Priest, and all 3 Chipmunk movies combined, confirm?
Petrified_Maid: Good...*slaps with cinderblock he stole from Meanwhile*
08,01Dermathil: but... i can play battleship with a piece of carboard, 2 pieces of paper and a pen!
XD
Irish_Pony: *dies from head trauma*
HUZZA!
i can play battleship with that, minus the cardboard.
Dermathil: question......what exactly are you talking about? cause im confused
Irish_Pony: My blood is now on your hands
11,01Dermathil: They released Battleship: The Game at $60?
08,01Dermathil: the nerve!
YES THEY DID
sun look strange

/me throws Dead_Maid into the cellar with the..."rest" and cleans his hooves
HEY KIDS!
oh NOW i get what your talking about Dermathil....kinda

.-.
1,3L4D: The Movie
I will soon
08,01seriously, you can get a ticket to BUCK for less that it costs to buy that shitty game
GOD NO!
08,01(coem to BUCK)
CeilingKirz: isnt that the game anyways?
No eclipse here :(
watching online. only a partial here in vegas.
PinkiePieFTW: You're going to need to be way more specific :D
11,01Well it was published by Activision.
/me 08,01plug plug plug
every maid!
:D
*game
PinkiePieFTW: YAY
/me eats some soylent green.
08,01Dermathil: movies cost more than $10?
and it is lame eclipse, moon is smallest it can be today by coincidence, not quite big enough to completely cover sun
hm... i'm not to good with emotes
08,01ChrysaMaid: did you get your package?
not yet
11,01So pricing a low-quality game at $60 shouldn't be surprising.
08,01did you parents yet?
11,01I've seen gameplay of it.
see: hollywood wonders why people pirate movies, when they put out shit like Battleshit
11,01It's more of a $30 game.
not on thurs when i spoke to them last
hey CeilingKirz wanna do a campaign? im bored and i REALLY need somthing to do..
ill ask again tomorrow if i speak to them
/me eats some soylent green.
what on earth did you buy me?
08,01do any of you play Go?
Whats that?
I wish I did
05hows that
Nope I'm not a PC gamer
12wheeeeeee
Maid_Discord: the missions are ALL THE EXACT SAME. You go on foot to disable Radar JAMMERS with C4 to allow you to get fleet fire support
Activision will do anything to make as much money off of a product as possible. I really can't stand them, and I hate the fact that Blizzard teamed with them for their game distribution.
12got another disc in Minecraft~
Go,... isnt a pc game per se
/me will be forever a console newbie
I wish I played Go. I never have, though.
Oh, back everypony. I almost got my story finished.:)
02LL :3
/me glomps TheRainbowDash
Wrek|Obsermaid liking the ears, you putting more time into them than before is paying off
why does everyone have maid in their name... ._.
08,01OtakuTom: learn it
02hai
Go is like... othello?
08,01it's very simple
Oh hai TheRainbowDash
08,01RyunosukeKnT: kinda, but not really
its hard to explain really
TheRainbowDash: Its maid hour :3
12hai BF
PinkiePieFTW: Apparently is Maid Hour. I not get either
08,01it's one of those problems that's easy for a human to play, but difficult for a computer to solve
/me hugs TheRainbowDash
Dermathil: Put it in a derpy.me and no one will ever knoooooooow! :O
lol ok.
08,01and it's the only game i fucking rock at
Dead_Maid: the mods who will click it WILL
i still prefer chess
08,01ChrysaMaid: boom
MaidWarrior: Oh, cool.:)
02drf's gonna be mad at you, you sure?
Dermathil: Details, details. My plan is FOOLPROOF
god damn nightmare to run through that search space
/me hides
OmegaMaidTroidBrony: big youtube celebrity
Gunthler: I always wub your hugs.
11,01OtakuTom: The mission of major game publishers is to nickel and dime gamers.
hell even chess can be a nightmare in a reasonable time
08,01ChrysaMaid: we call that "branching factor" in AI
11,01And charge as much as they can get away with.

lol I'm not sure if I should Like or Dislike this :D http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26639/Let%27s-See-How-Bad-I-Can-Make-This-Fanfic
I ripped into someone in the middle of a maths lesson for saying they were looking forward to watching Battleship.
where have you been all my life? lol jk
Yea, I don't get to see the ring of fire here in Chicago :(
oooh RD cutymark necklase?
why is she using rd's cutie mark?
XD
Ended up with the whole class attacking him. XD
lol
02XD
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
that would be such a stupid reason to ask someone out
Dat RD necklace :D
11,01I heard the movie was bad.
00,03Battleship was... not good.
"OMG we bot love cherry popsicles, you are my SOULMATE"
*both
XD
The movie is bad enough, but the game is WORSE^10
Lawl Ingwaz
I keed
Is that Dashie's cutie mark hanging around her neck? ;)
its far too bad its a bad movie, hopefully hasbro is able to regain all of their costs
you know what movie was good?
11,01And then Activision has the nerve to charge full-price for a mediocre knock-off.
what if they made a mlp movie with aliens
Ingwaz: Case of "your approval shames me" huh?
avengers.
I thought it was good. and funny.
02but it's hard to find someone who likes cherry popsicles D:
lovin' that necklace...
/me flees
mario_pony: Aliens in Equestria, huh? Or, like, a Michael Bay re-imagining of MLP?
lol suuuure
;P
and it's not even ponies just people
that have the same names
/me checks to see if Battleship officially failed at the box office.
hen3ry: basically. one time he got pissed because someone called him a not so nice word for a gay person. so he called them that back. when i explained the stupidity of it, he said, if they give me crap, i'll lower my self past their level 10x and give them crap back
Maid_Discord: yep this looks like it COMPERLY sucks
I can forgive Hasbro for Battleship movie, if they come out with FIM movie
lol battleship...
dumbest
kinda like how it's hard to find a Lugia AMV on YT?
Battleship...
idea
mario_pony: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2i379SyLZ1rpfrexo1_1280.jpg
ever
/me uber shot
helloooooooooo everyponyyyyyyy~
Oh hi Dashie_Dashie
PinkiePieFTW: one more reason why people thought Battleship was SO BAD. After seeing such a great tale with awesome characters that everybody LOVED on the big screen, and the movie ended up being more Bay crap.
ello Dashie_Dashie
I WANT A PONY MOVIE! :[
Lol
Cypresswolf|Spy: i really hope they do, it hink they could get their money back from it if they did
i can't believe they're making board game movies... what's next? monopoly?
02or someone with Lugia in their name? XD
LIFE
Hey hey hey Dashie_Dashie guy stay outta my shed ok
PinkiePieFTW: "Boardwalk will never be the same."
Who is wrek drawing?
Fun times Wrek is drawing :P just what I needed to see :)
XD
I want Battleship to fail so hard that MLP doesn't a fourth season due to all the losses.
For what it's worth? I've heard that Battleship does improve on a few things over Transformers....and it is worse than Transformers in several others, making it arguably worse overall.
I actually hoped that Battleship would be good and most of all BE SURPRISED BY IT. But no. It was horrible.
Monopoly movie? LOL just go visit Wall St.
i would actually watch that tbh
Hell, if they do make a FIM movie, I'll have to go to a midnight showing cause I DO NOT want to watch it surrounded by kids!
Dashie_Dashie: ^^ spitfire :D
Tovler: you should be ashamed
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: Tru dat
sweet
00,03I played the video game Battlefield...
Scoota....why
00,03SUPRISE! It's not like the board game :|
in battleship, the movie, did anyone say "you sunk my battleship"?
/me played the board game battleship
WHY
HAHAHAHAHA
DAT JOKE
WOULD YOU BUY A MOVIE-LICENSED GAME
Trololo
if not, it was a waste of a movie.
There's a Battlefield board game?
totally
EVER
:|
Maybe movie of Calan. MAYBE.
j/s your current nickname is pro
er, Catan
Ingwaz: I'm actually laughing hard.
11,01I feel that Battleship was forced.
whoa
?
Tovler: ?
could be a totally epic warriors name :O
that necklace is lookin real nice
lol what if they made Rock, Paper, Scissors
11,01Just Hollywood trying to make money off of a brand.
!warriorscats
CK|Ded: some are good at times. Transformers War for Cybertron is AWESOME.
PinkiePieFTW: Hungry Hungry Hippos, the movie
11,01Funny how Clue is a popular movie.
Maid_Discord: hasbro had to commission the script writer first
lol i saw that trailer.
00,03I just realized I said Battlefield -_-
on adult swim
but I dun wanna start my city state country or airport D:
robot chicken
Tom Curry and a maid
ScootaMexiMaid: lol
OH REALLY?
ScootaMexiMaid: what did you mean then?
it was pretty funny.
11,01Battleship the board game is fun.
*state
I'm a full grown man - the awkward of going to watch a movie about colorful ponies in broad daylight surrounded by nothing more than mom's & little kids
*Tim
CK|Ded: Shoots and Ladders: the Movie
ScootaMexiMaid, facepalm
*Chutes
00,03I meant Battleship! :D
11,01And you can probably find free versions online.
Good movie need good characters. Or awesome special fx. Clue has characters at least.
that one was a cop movie
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/26941/1/Nocturne/Nocturne-
chutes and ladders
!warriorscats Chicago
Dermathil: "Meh". I've never seen a game that I thought "wowie this is amazing" that was based on a movie.
lol fail
Only 1 prolbem she cleans theme with wubs
*problem
i liked "minesweeper" the movie.
dat spitfire...
from college humor.
:F
00,03there should be a Hungry Hungry Hippos movie~
11,01I heard that there was going to be a Candyland movie.
NOPE.AVI
They're hungry....
hen3ry: it needs an actual plot and good acting
FOR JUSTICE
"You ate my battleship!"
Maid_Discord: had the videogame been a battleship turn-based strategy or an RTS it would've been potentially okay.
05necklace Y7N?
what "the game of life" the movie.
who here watched Code Lyoko before?
NOPE.AVI^10
Maid_Discord...why do i want to see that
Wrek: Yes
Wrek|Obsermaid: yes indeed
11,01Adam Sandler?
Maid_Discord: i don't want to live on this planet anymore
Yesh Wrek
Wrek|Obsermaid: I like the necklace, so yes :)
ScootaMexiMaid: http://www.bestweekever.tv/bwe/images/2012/04/Hungry-Hungry-Hippos-Movie-Poster-1335368553.jpg
Ingwaz: Hollywood forget what those words mean. Except "plot."
Alicorn_Prince_Shane me
Yep.
Hi Ho Cherry-O would make for an epic movie.
Petrified_Maid: LOL!!!
NEW TOPIC: Who saw the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier advert?
oh, i've seen code lyoko
Candyland featuring Adam Sandler
:D
but a looong while ago.
Apprentely theres a 5th season coming out this year pyrocatboy
00,03Petrfied_Maid: OMG :D
was only kidding when said "ate battleship" ...
Who saw the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier trailers?
Ok if Hasbro can do a Battleship movie. Don't ya'll think there will be a MLP FIM somethime in da future?
hai
eeyup
*sometime
Hai CCCP done drawing?
Probably a made for TV or direct-to-video movie. Not likely theatrical release.
Hey hey hey CCCP
ScootaMexiMaid: /watch?v=WTSpNa06lxs
08,01Ponies47: i'm hopeful
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: not yet, im taking a break :)
Hasbro still focused on target demographic.
K
hi Ponies47
when's season 3 coming out?
Sometime in the Fall
PinkiePieFTW: no news yet
some point this summer
08,01i think a theatrical MLP release would net them a *lot* of money
hm...
I heard 9/15/2012 but not sure if legit
darn.
what if the season 3 finale was a movie
There already is a MLP movie!
08,01but then, the brony fanbase is still insignificant compared to the intended demographic fanbase, with respect to sales
Mario_Pony: that's what Season 2 pilot and finales were for
Two part episode != movie.
CCCP: not that type of movie.
hen3ry: yeah sort of
08,01Dermathil: i dunno; they might just give it a bigger budget
Dermathil: im taking about the g1 one
hen3ry: they tried to make the 2parters as movielike as possible. But they lacked enough time to make it flow naturally. That's why they are rushed.
Combine Mare in the Moon and Return of Harmony and you've got yourself a FIM movie :D
mario_pony: I know.
CCCP: yeah I knew that. But where talking about a G4 Movie
CCCP: THAT'S EXACTLY what I meant
oh :P
Ponies47: just cut and past g4 character heads on them
My Little Dashie, the movie.
CCCP: HA! Still not the same
/me 11,01dusts PinkiePieFTW
PinkiePieFTW: NOOOOOOOOOOO :'(
would y'all watch it?
But the closest to a FIM movie we'll get will be Direct-to-DVD, CALLING IT
Dermathil: The S2 finale is as close to a made-for-TV-movie as they've gotten so far
CK|Ded: I said that already. Before it that title went to Return of Harmony.
And it did a darn good job of it, actually.
I know that stuff.
not direct-to-dvd, derm
PinkiePieFTW: NOI WOULD CRY! :'( I'VE REED THE 1ST AND THE 2ND I CRIED AT BOTH! :'(
maybe made for tv
A documantary on cloppers?
08,01the thing i'd hope for with an MLP movie is enough budget to use a *real* orchestra for the music
08,01instea of just synths
PinkiePieFTW: Evample of what would happen:Brony:I AM A TRUE MAN! After my little dashie movie:I FEEL DEAD ON THE INSIDE!
i've read the 1st, but i don't want to read the second
Damn the drawing is looking sexy, wish i could draw that good my drawing suck compared to this
CCCP that is a terrible Idea
But this fanbase has grown significantly since I got in it - Houston's first brony meetup had barely 12 show up - the meet up at the season finally had well over 100! That's a HUGE difference - and I found a brony con in Austin in september :) This fandom is too big to be "insignificant"
OmegaMaidtroidBrony: hahahaha
Dermathil: if its a legitmate mlp:fim direct to dvd movie, i'd buy it day one
A real Orchestra would be fantastic
08,01Dermathil: i never said that!
I cried a single tear reading dashie
BUT YOU DID
when the guy was reading dashie's letter
^
it really got me.
YOU SAID REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF SYNTHS
Ok I'm just wondering after reading My Little Dashie did you cry?
SYNTHS ARE BY INGRAM
08,01Dermathil: yes
08,01synths are orchestral synths
THEREFORE REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF INGRAM
/me cried no tears after reading My Little Dashie. Which only made it worse :'(
It's ok
Dermathil: ingram is a songwriter/composer
08,01Dermathil: i don't think you really get how the scoring process workks
not a musician
i'm actually a really misty eyed person...
08,01i doubt that daniel ingram even orchestrates the music
i cry easy when watching movies/tv or reading books
/me had nothing to contribute so he sits back and watches
i believe thats what steffan andrews does isnt it
What about MOVIE.MOV?
lol
CCCP: NO
HAHAHAHAH CCP
08,01he probably churns out a song on piano, and gets someone else to orchestrate it
i would soooo watch that.
PinkiePieFTW: lol same
:3
08,01but i'm not sure
that would be awesome...
Ingwaz: :3
Movie.mov... ohh god that needs to happen...
CCCP: you're dangerous, i must end your life for the safety of bronies everywhere
PinkiePieFTW: ikr
/me knifes CCCP
Hello again.
/me punches Ingwaz
you know... whoever had the ingenious idea of releasing both the battleship movie on the same weekend as the Avengers, and the video game on the same weekend as D3, there is no hell good enough for that kind of double epic failure
DON'T TOUCH CCCP
bai gotta go!
Ingwaz: et tu brute?
/me dies
cya EpicPwnTime3
Bai EpicPwnTime3
/me touches CCCP in ALL THE RIGHT PLACES
giggity
there's a battleship game?
O_O
RyunosukeKnT: you mean on the same DAY as Diablo 3?
I'm back again.
CCCP: wow what a classy way to die
bye EpicPwnTime3
Next time, we eat SPITFIRE!
twilight_sprinkler: ikr
true Dermathil
(other than the boardgame, obviously)
Ingwaz: lol :D
05wow
PinkiePieFTW: yes. it is a 4-hour long FPS priced at 60$
05ive been going on for long :o
I need to check what other movies are in right now - a double feature of lesser movies sounds pretty good right now
hm...
OtakuTom: I have seen him angrier
Wrek|Obsermaid: just a little..
well, movie games suck anyways.
barely
http://derpy.me/eejTt
you know, as in FIRST PERSON SHOOTER
11,01Dermathil: Did you buy the game?
Well yea...but it's still fun to see him that angry...lol
No.
RAWRity: LOLOLOL
:P
RAWRity: nick cage is best all around actor...
After I reed My Little Dashie I felt like Pinkie Pie in Babycakes when she cryed :'(
Dermathil: I saw that review. Twas funny
08,01Dermathil: aye, looks like i'm wrong; he does orchestrate the songs himself
hello all again.
lol
08,01but the difference would be in the performance, not the writing
I was surprised he didn't go lower, though.
11,01I saw a Giant Bomb playthrough.
reading my little dashie is like a right of passage for becoming a brony.
Hey hey hey WallDives guy stay outta my shed
hi WallDives
Ponies47: bah to you and your shed.
See: Sword of the Stars 2, Mass Effect 3
So, newest ep of YOung Justice was...a lot of stalling followed by 30 seconds of infodump.
2/10 seems high for a 4-hour experience that pretty much just functions.
Giant Bomb did a First Impressions? OH DAMN I WANT TO SEE IT
have any of you guys taken the ultimate brony challenge?
08,01i'd *love* to here Ingram and William Anderson's music with a real orchestra
PinkiePieFTW: Lesson Zero was the path I choose
WallDives; Okie doki loki
he was... less than thrilled with ME3 ending
Dark Shadows & Battleship - hows that for a double feature?
I'll be taking on the ultimate brony challenge soon...once I have a couple days off of work and I can afford to be up for that long.
11,01PinkiePieFTW: Watching MLP straight w/o sleeping?
yeah

i'm gonna do it with some friends eventually
what
11,01With my sleeping issues, I could do that easily.
CK|Ded: no it is actually accurate. Most reviewers would've given it a 5/10 because it is not good enough for a 6 but is better than some titles that were rated 3. (But it deserves 2 because of the USELESS rating inflation)
!warriorcats
the other movies in my nearest theatre - except for the Dictator, are even worse than Battleship sounds
I watched every episode that was out at the time when I became a brony NON-STOP!

Ah yes, Game Review ratings. Where anything below 8/10 means it's AWFUL, but the publishers are being paid to promote it.

02oh, now it's just cats

02it thinks that any script that begins with w is the weather script
eeyup
/me 11,01cleans SparklyWaffles and makes him super purple.
hulk was hilarious
To be honest I wasn't fond of Burton's versions of Alice or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
RAWRity: I heard it is funny. I am actually tempted to see it.
I loved Hulk's surprise left on Thor :D
So....to imagine films I like less than those....ew.

LD
Stan Lee cameo made me laugh too
X'D

Ponies47: can't really these days.

I dont like pretty much any new tim burton films

PinkiePieFTW: He was in the 2003 Hulk.
Cypresswolf|Spy...heros in my city....ha your crazy
/me shrugs.
Dermathil; Well when you get the chance. Watch it.
Otakon, shipped so much there's a song

spoiler alert for the avengers: snape kills dumbledore.
Maid_Discord: we can make this maid day
Ugh. I still need to punch the idiot who thought it was a good idea to force the otakonship on bronystate. It should've been met like every time someone tries to force a meme on 4chan.
