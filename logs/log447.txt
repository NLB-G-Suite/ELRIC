Whats that?
I'm a voice actor, I can voice each and everyone of them but I don't know which one.
da fuq?
03flash memory can be more dangerous, because if it breaks, it breaks
02they could already be putting movies and games an SD if they wanted.

Prideful since she is a Wonderbolt
Timid.
Prideful pwease
Prideful fits her character :)
but oh the irony

In hindsight, I probably should have thought that entrance out bettere

11,01Really?
no maid include? Then no want.
11,01It is.
Oww D:
I thiught cosplay costumes were way more than that
Lets talk about random stuffs!!!!
Hi again, everypony
whered everyone disappear to in the last 40 orso minutes i was recording
11,01Me too.
02don't worry, it's smooth :3
I must be the only one willing to play Barbie Girl on the air
03I was going to actually
dem male sizes XD
11,01And that site does free custom measurements (which I'll need. None of those preset sizes work).
03but I need to recreate my edit of it
well I take that back
even though we have played it on different bands
AM in mine
Thats awesome, hahaha.
that chatception :)
02drf
seen man wear maid costume before two times. very different circumstance. Not want discuss.
03I'm allowed to play whatever I want
02ah
although it might not fit the format
of the show that is
although its good timing
/me glomps everypony
11,01I'd look ugly.
I'm fine with wearing dresses, I guess. Wanna know why?
02if you can play whatever you want, then you should just play static
02:3
thats illegal
02LOL really?
*when
yes
*30 minutes
03well, more than a certain amount at least
Someone should draw all of our OCs in maid outfits
11,01RaveBrony: Embarrassing?
/me has been lurking
yes
02why is it illegal? O_o
I forget how much though
draw ALL the OCs? :(
03well it's not "illegal" but it goes against FCC policies :P
but I am pretty sure part 73 of the FCC rules and regulations should shed some light
11,01I see nothing wrong with wearing dresses. Women wear pants nowadays.
03hence why our station just plays music from a computer when nobody's hosting a show
02ah
:O
no way!!
/me thinks a chick in baggy pants is cute tbh >.>
:O :O
/me is uberglomped
05hmm
music's ok
and take pics!! :D
It might be entertaining
11,01If other people joined, that might help us raise money faster next time.
hmm
11,01panda: Me neither.

Ive only cosplayed once... aas Shippo from Inuyasha :)
I has glomped all day x_x

11,01Really, I have a $200+ debt to clear.
I wish i had the money for cosplay.... :\

*Tim
*Chutes
11,01And you can probably find free versions online.
Good movie need good characters. Or awesome special fx. Clue has characters at least.

00,03there should be a Hungry Hungry Hippos movie~
11,01I heard that there was going to be a Candyland movie.
NOPE.AVI
They're hungry....
FOR JUSTICE
"You ate my battleship!"
05necklace Y7N?
NOPE.AVI^10
Maid_Discord...why do i want to see that
11,01Adam Sandler?
Yep.
Hi Ho Cherry-O would make for an epic movie.
oh, i've seen code lyoko
:D
but a looong while ago.
00,03Petrfied_Maid: OMG :D
was only kidding when said "ate battleship" ...
hai
*sometime
Probably a made for TV or direct-to-video movie. Not likely theatrical release.
08,01Ponies47: i'm hopeful
K
when's season 3 coming out?
Sometime in the Fall
Saturn: I would think of it as a series finally
some point this summer
hm...
I heard 9/15/2012 but not sure if legit
Saturn: it wouldnt make a ton, but it would be much mor ecost effective as well
darn.
Saturn: I actually don't really hope for a movie. Because they would probably hand the franchise to an OUTSIDER to the studios.
Two part episode != movie.
yeah Saturn id enjoy a movie.....but i would prob be unable to go see it lol
08,01Dermathil: i dunno; they might just give it a bigger budget
Combine Mare in the Moon and Return of Harmony and you've got yourself a FIM movie :D
oh :P
would y'all watch it?
And it did a darn good job of it, actually.
not direct-to-dvd, derm
maybe made for tv
A documantary on cloppers?
08,01instea of just synths
i've read the 1st, but i don't want to read the second
Saturn: don't want Ingram? BLASPHEMY
A real Orchestra would be fantastic
08,01Dermathil: i never said that!
BUT YOU DID
^
it really got me.
YOU SAID REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF SYNTHS
SYNTHS ARE BY INGRAM
08,01Dermathil: yes
08,01synths are orchestral synths
THEREFORE REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF INGRAM
It's ok
08,01Dermathil: i don't think you really get how the scoring process workks
not a musician
Saturn: ;P
08,01i doubt that daniel ingram even orchestrates the music
i cry easy when watching movies/tv or reading books
lol
HAHAHAHAH CCP
i would soooo watch that.
:3
08,01but i'm not sure
that would be awesome...
Saturn: if it was the case we'd have heard anything about them by now
Hello again.
bai gotta go!
/me dies
giggity
O_O
I'm back again.
(other than the boardgame, obviously)
05wow
05ive been going on for long :o
hm...
barely
http://derpy.me/eejTt
you know, as in FIRST PERSON SHOOTER
Well yea...but it's still fun to see him that angry...lol
No.
:P
hello all again.
lol
08,01but the difference would be in the performance, not the writing
I was surprised he didn't go lower, though.
See: Sword of the Stars 2, Mass Effect 3
2/10 seems high for a 4-hour experience that pretty much just functions.
08,01i'd *love* to here Ingram and William Anderson's music with a real orchestra
Saturn: that would be cool
yeah
both seasons
!weather Chicago
