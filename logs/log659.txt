WOOOOOOO!

I liked this more than the actual Trek Movie
Alan Rickman/10
Dat ass.
The End.
The announcer sounds familiar.
SO yeah this movie is pretty fucking great
My theory is that the government covered up the crash and gave them the new show to keep them all quiet.
woooo
Why did i missed this:(
this movie > Space Jame
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the movie just before the opening credits for the new Galaxy Quest series, the announcer says "Now back after 18 years, the New Adventures of Galaxy Quest" The original Star Trek was cancelled in 1969 and the Next Generation premiered in 1987, also 18 years later.
I hadn't heard of this before it was drawn. I loved it :O
Fluttercry: Minus thousands of Bronies attempting to storm the stage >_>
Anti psychopathic meds ?
mfw Space Jam and this movie have the exact same plot
Star Trek Reference/10
yah tshirt...
remake the show in space?
And then someone figures out that there is a real spaceship behind them and the government kidnaps them for questioning
hey space jam was pretty god when i was 11
Hooray new adventures.
Fluttercry, that's more like if the Mane 6 visited Bronycon, along with Spike and Queen Chrysalis
*good
COME ON AND SLAM! AND WELCOME TO THE JAM!
anti ED meds?
My theory is that the government covered up the crash and gave them the new show to keep them all quiet.
new serie!
And then we rot our meager brains with space jam. Le sigh

SPACE JAM BABY
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The promotional campaign for the film included a "mockumentary" for the E! cable channel about the fictional Galaxy Quest TV series. Most of the cast members appeared as their actor characters from the film. Extras from the film's convention scenes also appeared as fans giving candid interviews. Out-takes and behind the scenes footage from the film were used as
Mum/10
Snape/10
11/10
Beryllium/10. Would larp again.
1,11clips from the TV show. The humor even went so far as Sigourney Weaver's character, Gwen DeMarco, claiming that she had turned down "a small part in a Woody Allen movie" to do the Galaxy Quest series [A reference to one of her first, though very brief, big screen cameos as Alvy's (Allen's) date at the end ofAnnie Hall].

13I loved Galaxy Quest. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of Trek, but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played "the kid" about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas. — Wil Wheaton, who played "the kid" Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation

“I had originally not wanted to see Galaxy Quest because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said “You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre”. And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact t

and im great at making friends and stuffs

Silverscreen i guess you won't be here tommorrow, but how does this movie hold up? (though i haven't seen the full thing)
Gravity Falls is amazing. I'm afraid to hype it up
Sarris totally looked like a member of GWAR
weeping_pegasi82: from what I heard of, yes
“I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don’t know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing Nichelle Nichols.” – William Shatner

otakon haha
Let's stream Firefly

i barely passed the suicide prevention course
01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: This is THE sci-fi comedy movie. I honestly can not think of a movie as good as this. Perfectly cast, perfectly performed, perfectly shot. The story is believable for its setting, its characters enjoyable and memorable, the comedy is spot on, the references are great for any sci-fi lover, and its effects are pretty damn good for being made in the late 1990's.

otakon: I'm guessing it's a bug they're working on.
I'm fairly well versed in psychological conditions but only from hobby.
I think it’s a chillingly realistic documentary [laughs]. The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it’s going to be the genuine, true Star Trek fans who will save the day. I was rolling in the aisles. And Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and Sigourney rolls her eyes and says, â

08,01so i've just worked out
01,11Galaxy Quested created it's humor by being an original series, and added the satire overtop. Which is why I qualify it as a better movie than Blazing Saddles and SPaceballs. It's not about how much I like them, but about how they're made.

01,11Cowvarkian: Haven't seen that movie in a long time, but from what I remember, it's kinda in between. It's a story everyone knows and follows a certain formula, but at the same time making it a comedy makes it rather original.
So scary....................
who were you talking about Meanwhile?
The horror
RAWRity: I bet he was talking about Trixie
was she pretty?
Sarcastic Twilight is best twilight
SHe must for mining for cobblestone.

13meanwhile on the edge of viridian forest
Spike! Stay here and miss another adventure!
Story*
the funny thing is, I originally never planned on writing that fic
You know, there was an oft-parodied tendancy in Star Trek TOS about societies that based themselves after small parts of human history. A TNG episode had aliens who recreated a work of fiction mistaking it for reality. I think that's the foundation for the Thermian civilization: what if an alien race models their society based on Star Trek?
Holy shit she went in
poison joke
applebloom makes good pie
but then everyone in the chat pestered me about it for 2 months.
AJIsAwesome: Why Applebloom is acting more mature than Applejack
Dark92Enigma: Oh.
*cough*foreshadowing
IM HERE
shizu: I'm not sure but I think that's Pokemon.
Shizuka better have some super repel
AJIsAwesome: in this episode*
technically they are
SURPRISE
<.<
Spike gets to stay behind in case Applebloom comes back. Read that as: "Spike, you're non essential and unimportant, stay here."
Mumbo Jumbo

you know, you'd think that with the wide range of movie that get released, people would request more than like, the same 10 films. Also, you'd think people would request episodes other than Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed
but my roomate hates girl love D:
00,03You get a rize!
what do i do!
LOL
01,11Agree with Shizuka. I want some more diversity with the episode selections. How long has it been since we seen Look before you Sleep or Swarm of the Century? Have we ever showed Green Isn't Your Color since S2 ended? What about Sweet and Elite or Mare Do Well? There's tons of episodes that just aren't selected anymore.
so, how many times has that made lesson zero been played here?

00,10yeah so?
05,15SpacePretender you're right. I never realized that

RAWRity: both
00,10oh you meen the pony ep
I ask for "Green is not your Color" pretty much every week.

0,14I'll, uh, be over THERE
0,14in the corner
00,03Yeah, that MLP moive, you heard?

Finally Lesson Zero wins...though now I have a problem of picking a new pony episode to vote forn ow...
I don't think it has ever been shown on BS.
Lesson Zero always wins.
twilight_sprinkle: Wrek you won with my picks!
I'll watch space jam tomorrow. It's 2am and I have a big day of exploring Pandora ahead of me! Bye everypony :)
CK|Werk: IKR? :|
but but but but but but but but but HOW?!!!!!
I know we haven't seen my MLP pick yet...
01,11kidzrul434: The last time I remember watching Space Jam was the second week of BMN.
Hello everypony, just got back from school and then job, what did i miss?
Oh, it was streamed?
Yes, yes we will need therapy after this next movie!
it's one of my favs just for the gag/running time density
I'm probably the only one voting for it, too.
twilight_sprinkle: I picked the same Batman movie too!
But then again, that was sooooo long ago.
Silverscreen: iunno
Oh leverage.
maybe encores should be removed pre lotto?
This is the first time Lesson Zero's won since i've been voting lotto. I mean it has been shown once or twice outside of BMN
DSNesmith: i was more syaing fanservice is the only reason Luna Eclipsed gets the praise and felatio it does from the fandom.
I actually like MDW, even though it has it faults. To be honest, I LOVE the episode.
Dark92En|gma: thats the 2008 right? im kinda confused with the similar names, i havent seen it before
When was Dark Knight shown last? I feel like we've seen that recently.
Dovah Galaxy Quest and Bridle Gossup
but it was also a funny episode
Silverscreen: so this calls for a THROWBACK
that's why I like it
Would Feeling Pinkie Keen be considered one of those eps that gets showed too much?
I'm contempt knowing i will probably never get picked for this god forsaken lottery.
Seriously, stop for a second and think about that. "We're letting you pick what episodes we show, but if you keep picking your favorites (which logically most people are going to do) then we'll whine." wat.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: like 9 months at least i think
I actually try to put up various obscure episode
the poison ivy.... IT ITCHESSSSS fffff *scratch scrape bodyslide*
like this week was.....
also
twilight_sprinkle: EEEEEYUP, the 2008 one
WHY NO LOVE FOR APPLEJACK
we rarely she her one episode
Dark92En|gma: ok good, ive never seen it :P
twilight_sprinkle: Oh was it? Maybe I've just seen it recently then lol.
have next weeks movies been selected? and if so what are they?

AJIsAwesome, knows what's up
How long is space jam?
01,11AJIsAwesome: I loved Mare Do Well too. I highly disagree with people saying that everyone was out of character.
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle!
Dark92En|gma: and now i cant complain about it anymore :(
Silverscreen: /)
i picked suited for succsess
I got picked for the B movie like 3 times in the first 2 months of BMN, but not at all since. I got to get some good Halloween picks now.
I'm back. My internet derped
/me hugs Dark92En|gma :D
cupofshit, how eloquent
Silverscreen: I don't have character issues with that episode. I do admit that the episode botched its moral, though.
oh good its open
thank god
mare do well wasnt a bad ep
Silverscreen: and the moral? it was al little..........forced
I agree you guys should extend the amount of time a pony episode can been shown again to prevent so many encores
IMO*
I've been voting for Dragon Quest since the last chance I got my pick
and yes, applejack only has one episode
05,15Such a professional no?
Bronysith: Bogus.
Fluttercry: pretty much.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tpCRBgs-LE&feature=relmfu
You mean Derpy?
01,11CK|Werk: How so? I thought the message was quite clear: Don't be an arrogant jerk. Don't let fame go to your head and act like an idiot just to be popular.
oh, your not here :P
Says a guy who's voted Lesson Zero, but this is the first time I've seen it win since I started voting for lotto
Did the lotto already happened>
13best part of my horrible video right here
?
Everlasting_Joy: no one remembers her other episode cause they have boners from derpy talking
13nifflas is awesome
Goodnight everyone, thanks for the movies <3
we talking about rainbow dash... or trixy Silverscreen
0,14>this video
Ryunosuke: RD.
0,14>horrible
0,14nah
Silverscreen: i guess you were talking to me........
Derpy talking was at least noteworthy because nobody expected it.
00,03ahem http://i.imgur.com/3yUJ5.jpg
Bronysith: Agreed, but I remember them.
Now I have a dilemma. I don't what Pony Ep to vote for anymore now
What were the winners?
05,15>implying this video is bad
Silverscreen: You mean like the other members of the Mane 6 were doing? :P "A real hero doesn't brag!" hot off the heels of each member of MDW bragging about their own achievements.
05,15OH GOD MY SIDES
So which pony episodes are next week?
Sumica is streaming, right?
01,11actually, that could go to both of you.
CLOCK EEZ TEEKING
AJIsAwesome, I know, it just seems like after the whole Trixy ep, RD would have gotten the hint :)
Oh.
Silverscreen: oh :)
But they had to put it in with MLP FIMs least fav of the mane six
and Last Round-up as a whole was rather uneven, so were it not for Derpy, most wouldn't even remember it.
13http://i.imgur.com/lZ22u.jpg it is bad and you know it don't you
Scoot-Scootaloo, that hurted

00,03also, why is Ash wearing Samus' suit?
:I
00,10yeah Dark92Enigma
01,11CK|Werk: It's called a lesson through example. They were giving RD a taste of her own medicine, only doing it to show RD how much of a jerk she was being. None of it was real for them.
Scoot-Scootaloo.

Scoot-Scootaloo, you're French?
Scoot-Scootaloo ohmygosh.
do I have to get Ash in a maid outfit again?

0,14who, me?
You know, this is just my opinion, but, I don't think mods should be allowed to participate in the lottery. Seems like they win too much.

no, Bronysith

I'll reserve opinions of season 3 for when season 3 is out.
MrBen, YES.

GRRRRR.
SO RIGGED.

Shizuka, Sumica, if you're streaming......please play the Nostalgia Critic review of Space Jam when Movie Night is over.......please :(?
Oh, I know.
RAWRity: because if i say it is going to be disapointing then when it is awesome i will be "HOLY SHIT THAT IS AWESOME"
00,03French people are Prop people~
Silverscreen: The problem is that it doesn't work, it's hypocrisy. That would be the case if they were complimenting each others' achievements, but they weren't. They were doing exactly what she was doing, and then trying to be high and mighty on the moral high horse about it. It just falls flat.
it sucks that i can only go on one website at a time on my phone :/

We have to go derper!
or, you could, you know, just not try and hype it up or down, and wait for it.
05,15Because season 2 was. I'm not going to say Season 3 is going to be bad, but I'm just being cautious
k, back. I avoided the lottery so I wouldn't have to face losing the lottery again.
derpenest
actually, would be inclined to agree that the mods seem to have a higher chance of winning :)
00,10you realy think I would pick this crap if it was rigged?
13if it were rigged, we would have atlas shrugged for B, because i didn't even vote this week
Deeeper. There's mufins there...
if I want character development I'll read a book or watch a dramatic series
00,03no video links please~
yea same here, comparisons to both seasons, season 1 was trying to find it's place, and season 2 kinda got too comfortable in the safe zone if you catch my drift
01,11They were doing what she was doing to prove the point. They did it NOT because they were being arrogant, they were doing it because they wanted RD to realize how annoying it was. -_-
SpacePretender I'm going to have to start participating for the lottery just for that movie.
We +m the TOOT spam here, yes?
There's also the fact that the show DID have character development in S2.

people hated the CMC episodes, FPK, owl's well
01,11Spazturtle: this is the argument everyone brings up, and here's my argument back: Think about RD's character. They know she doesn't listen when she thinks she's right. They could talk to her all they wanted, but her overinflated ego would have just ignored it and moved on to another fan. They had to teach through example.
TOOT
they're just nostalgiaing
otto otto otto
I love Ponecrat... er, minecraft
i don't get it
0,14I actually liked the CMC eps
Silverscreen: The problem with presenting a moral in that fashion is that you're not any better than the other person. You're basically saying "watch as I act like a wanker so that I can show you how much of a wanker you are". That just makes you BOTH wankers.
Damnit Pinkie.
TOOTsie Rolls
cell fones off guys
I almost want to pick Southland Tales for B. It would blow Atlas Shrugged out of the water.

08,02hmm... nah

While I feel taht S2 was better overall than S3, I will admit that is has the downright worst episode in the series.
00,10time to jam.......in space
Would skype count as a phone?
Silverscreen: My headcanon is that most of the town was in on it, too. So she didn't really lose any reputation or the like.

WHY is everyone so EXCITED for this ho hum movie?
booooooo to R. Kelly
0,14I MEANT BASKETBALLS
Also
I BELIEVE CAN FLY!
Silverscreen: And considering how easy it would be to avoid the problem altogether (simply by having the characters refer to each others' statements, lending greater strength to the idea of encouraging each others' accomplishments) does make the episode a bit weaker on the whole. It honestly could have been done better, is all.
Goddamnit, missing Space Jam.

01,11CK|Werk: Sometimes the best and only way to get someone to understand something is to show them exactly what they're doing wrong. That's what they did. And at the end, they openly stated that they weren't being jerks, they were trying to teach RD.

Silverscreen: Being a jerk and saying "oh I'm just trying to teach someone a lesson" generally doesn't work out to you being some sort of moral authority in real life, Silver. :P
Sumica you're thinking of shaq
Meanwhile, ._.
Meanwhile, and the first thing you do is tell everyone on irc about it?

01,11CK|Werk: That bit is completely contraditing to what they were trying to do. They wanted to show Rainbow Dash that being arrogant isn't good. The only way to do that was to show Rainbow Dash how bad it was because she wouldn't have learned otherwise.

but does it go with fresh prince?
we should have Looney Tunes: Back in Action too
00,03HOOP! THERE IT IS!
Yeah yeah it's fine.
Silverscreen: Again, for what it's worth I actually like the episode. But I have to admit that it has its faults and flaws, the big one being the method of presenting the moral. Sort of like how the Pinkie Sense was a good story that ended up poorly explaining its moral.
05,15I know the movie is terrible. But I love it
WELCOME TO THE SPACE JAM

01,11I WILL attempt to give a real review at the end though.

0,14that's not a world I want to live in
CrimsonPhoenix: I suppose I should take this as a given, but I suppose somebody already did a Space Jam/Fresh Prince mash up?
Same
Bugs Bunny is awesome
bugs bunny is teh best
Shizuka: Weird, ain't it? I grew up on WB shorts.
bugs buny's modern take is in some shitty animated sitcom
sadistic rodent
05,15Shizuka they rebooted Loony Toons
Bugs was best
Shizuka some do
i have to admit, i never got into looney tunes until watching this as a kid
I think this is a guilty pleasure for a lot of people
of course they don't know what bugs bunny is
This movie is ok. Btut we should stream Looney Tunes Back in Action sometime :3
MrBen, I believe so, let me search it up and I'll pm you
Sure they do. Bug Bunny is that guy in that boring ass show on CN
00,03The hell is a Bugs Bunny? Is that some sort of hooker name?
wait
Shizuka: They have a new Looney Tunes show
>reboot
Scoot-Scootaloo: :I
>Looney Toons
Scoot-Scootaloo: XD
Watched this movie so many times ^-^
its the shame the new bugs bunny show is mostly a sitcom
THE FUCK
13they shunted the good stuff to boomerang, along with goddamn dexters lab
Shizuka: There's the Looney Tunes Shows plus CN still shows old-school Looney Tunes
One does not simply reboot Looney Toons.
It's been years since I watch this movie,
to this day, Michael Jordan is the only basketbal player I actually recognise
Shizuka: I'd pity today's children if it weren't for MLP
it's shamelessly 90s awful
needs more seizure
.
that's why it's awesome
Well that was good timing
chat move too fast
Gawd dang it Scoot.
I belive shizu was talking about the crazy antics bugs, not reboot
Fluttercry, into jaded overly grown-up characters with a Seinfeld flavor? ....ewwgh for me at least @_@
wrong cash-in on basketball player's succes film
13a show that started in 1997 does not belong on the channel started by flintstones
Scoot-Scootaloo Bugs Bunny was an MLG pro before MLG existed :3
Shizuka: That's what the Season DVDs are for.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The concept for this movie originated from a series of highly popular Nike ads where Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan faced off against Marvin the Martian and his alien henchmen in basketball.
went to the shop and back
there is that other Looney Tunes reboot tooo
Silverscreen: i call this movie.....a ''gulity pleasure''......i loved it as a child, and the age, and the Nostalgia Critic made me realize how bad it is......but it's A MASTERPIECE COMPARED to.............the movie that followed it
Shizuka: dexters lab? isnt that on right now?
hay everypony
Hi JappleAck
Also, Looney Toons in the Golden Era was kinda a reboot in itself of the classic, more music-oriented Merry Melody shorts.
They still show old-school Looney Tunes at like 11 or so
@Shizuka i dont think so
*success
hi JappleAck
hello JappleAck
ironically, Lola is the only boring toon in this movie.

I've heard of movies based off books. Based off real life. Based off video games. But based off ADVERTISEMENTS??
Silverscreen: So this Movie is A COMMERCIAL based from a COMMERCIAL

Dante: HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!
DSNesmith: now he does comercials for underwear while sporting a Hitler 'stache

Shizuka, you're a cordcutter too?
Argh, my eyes are still recovering from that opening.

I remember this happening and being convinced I struck it rich with my Michael Jordan UNC highlights trading card.
Shizuka: They did show old stuff on Cartoon Planet recently on Fridays
THAT'S NOT BAD WRITING, IT REALLY HAPPENED <---

But, seriously, we should finally stream WFRR
Ohai, activity!
I'm on a drug called Michael Jordan

Hi Stan
but you are bugs
Oh god

I know the Kids'WB shows made fun of this. Animaniacs spoofed it and Quest for Camelot. The Warner Bros made a good indie film that Plotz turned down and Plotz made "Jam-a-lot"
that's a big golf ball hole
Don'T CLOSE IN on his face
Ohi stan

Did they call 911?

it's always a good idea to have the story based around someone who can't act >_>

I believe this came out in '97, whereas Futurama came out in '99 (when the series itself first starts).

Alister, I mean they're open and without predispositions about their world. >8v

Sometimes, though, they can come from the nation next door.

Oooo!
Oh yeah, the movie's a lot of fun.
Is this what Lauren Faust sees at every con? O_O;;
Galaxy Quest Dancers, Sign me UP!
:'(
Kurra: hope not...
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene when Tim Allen is in a mens room overhearing how the cast of Galaxy Quest are nobodies and all the co-stars can't stand him mirrors an actual event in William Shatner's life. He discovered the exact same things about himself when he attended a Star Trek convention.
2,14 Kurra: eenope...she sees much...much worse
Even if you've never watched Star Trek?
Kurra that would imply people HATE MLP
Vordox: Nah-- I know full well that the Euro contengent doesn't always understand US slang. So, I'm here to translate!
Silverscreen: Oh god...
Ponies47: sucks to hear that. Wish there was anything I could do. <3
Caramel, you can't be serious D:
It's a parody, the only relation to actual Star Trek are jokes.
Kencolt: <3 Thank you for translating
Also, that kid looks familiar...
I won't get the jokes :<

And he still wears the makeup even at home
Ninjazz: It's a medical condition.
What movie is this?
JESmith71: Keeping in role
JESmith71 he's a dedicated actor :P
01,11To be fair, Shatner was a bit of an asshole in the prime of his Star Trek fame.
Now that's a role decication
hehe
CountDoofus, I'd seek immediate help.
Silverscreen 'a bit'?
Silverscreen: Still...
whoa, mullet time.
I actually saw galaxy quest for the first time about a week ago.
Half of the audience have probably written fanfics of the Commander and Headpiece-guy
One of my favorate movies
CountDoofus: I've been in this sort of mod for atleast a week now or so it changes from time to time. Just general stuff in life you know? The only thing that made me really happy was I became a admin for a Steeam group.
ded
2,14 I'd be an asshole too if I had to deal with trekies the way he did
if hes just a low class actor how can he afford to live in a house like that?!!
Whats this?
Ponies47 You know what else sucks? High school :O

The Klaatu nebula....
ya there Blako?
Ponies47 as soon as it ends, trust me...it gets a hell load betta :D
Silverscreen: He was also, during the actual making of the showl, an insane prankster. Nimoy's books about the making ( I am not Spock and I Am Spock) showed him to play crazy jukes frequently.
In fifteen years there'll be a movie about the MLP Cast going to Equestria.
Ponies47: High school sucks, real life starts after.
Deadlypon3: I'm a freshman ;_;
YOOUUAAREELAASTHOOPEE

01,11According to writer David Howard, the continuous melodic yet monotone voice of Thermian Cmdr. Mathesar was an original idea that Enrico Colantoni brought to the character. Everyone on the set loved it so much they kept it as a character trait.

11,01True Vordox.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Dean Parisot and star Tim Allen have revealed in interviews that the original tone of the film was much darker, with more scenes of violence. After test screenings the film was re-cut to emphasize the comedy and obtain a PG rating.
<---- inb4 Big mistake
where i got most of them - ebay
Do people really ACTUALLY want to create an MLP religion? Fffffff......
11,01Some Star Trek nerds make Jedi a religion.

i check it every day for spyro stuff
Nittany_Discord: Isn't that Star Wars nerds?
Nittany_Discord: So I heard... But there's some thing you forgot..

Star warks is now canon

11,01Yeah. The Island of Equestria project flopped.

thats the guy from harry potter
What were the people making the island thinking? Even if they got the money they wouldn't have the constant supply of cash to keep such a place habitable
why?
he was violating ebay policy by manipulating bids. i didn't want to report him because i wanted it :)
JESmith71: Exactly my thoughts.
JESmith71: Exactly.
01,11I just noticed that Rickman has a bit of a niche: His characters are usually angsty and pissed. XD

Moomy Tim Allen said a bad word! D:
*Mommy
:P
Silverscreen just said I can marry his random movie trivia
Who's the guy with the blade head?
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Alan Rickman never takes off his headpiece throughout the entire movie. Even in the scene when he and Gwen (Sigourney Weaver) are both at home talking to each other on the phone, Rickman still has his headpiece on, even though he is not in costume.
this is likely a good movie, but it causes me pain sorta.... @_X;
epic
Kurra, it gets better pretty soon
i don't really hate on the movie.

Where's Monk?
EspyLacopa: he got left behind
LAWl Tim Allen! XD
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Thermians use appearance generators to assume human form, while their true form is that of massive alien beings with several tentacles. This concept was possibly taken from the Star Trek episode By Any Other Name

I probably won't get any references,but I know the Futurama episode that was based on this.Fair enough.

01,11I have to agree, the design and costume for Sarris is pretty damn cool.
Oh... I guess som,ebody set them up the bomb
red loks blue to me
honestly, if any aliens need our help, I'd tell them to go play Steam and figure us out that way.
looks
the design of the protector is actually really, really good too
WHY
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The design for Sarris' starship is a crossover between the designs for the planet-killing "Doomsday Machine" from Star Trek: The Doomsday Machine (notably the massive, glowing maw in the front of the ship) and a D'deridex-class Romulan warbird from Star Trek: The Next Generation (the open design of the rear nacelles).
Silverscreen: Indeed. And as I said, this movies Props are SUPRISINGLY good.
Steam is prolly the easiest way to crosstrain humans and aliens for ANYTHING possible.
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
They're coming

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The set of the NSEA Protector was built on an articulated platform so that it could move a few feet in any direction, for a touch of realism (instead of actors leaning in unison).

Nevermind
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: At the end of the movie just before the opening credits for the new Galaxy Quest series, the announcer says "Now back after 18 years, the New Adventures of Galaxy Quest" The original Star Trek was cancelled in 1969 and the Next Generation premiered in 1987, also 18 years later.
08,01DoctoDoctorWho: greetings, slave
\ 8D! /
so your saying we could've just watched the first and last 5 minutes and understand everything?
2,14 meh, it has nothing compared to the first season :P
MaxTheBrony: that's annoying
LOL
Jane Doe
11,01It would be interesting if they made a series out of this, but I don't know if they would use the same actors.

vordox. try refreshing a few times. sometimes it produces error messages
4/10 there were no Ewoks.
9/10 seriously, a brillant movie
And now as we are giving our reviews, I will know show what the Star Trek cast thought of this movie (INCOMING WALLS OF TEXT)

Just brilliant

DaringDerpy: I'm having a good connection for once I am NOT refreshing :D
i give it a "Make it so."/10
“I had originally not wanted to see Galaxy Quest because I heard that it was making fun of Star Trek and then Jonathan Frakes rang me up and said “You must not miss this movie! See it on a Saturday night in a full theatre”. And I did and of course I found it was brilliant. Brilliant. No one laughed louder or longer in the cinema than I did, but the idea that the ship was saved and all of our heroes in that movie were saved simply by the fact t
I started off ewwwed by it, now I <3 it, good job :3
Thank you Bronystate!
THANK YOU
Np.
9/10 Pretty fun. Alan Rickman. For a person who never watched a bit of Star Trek, it was pretty enjoyable.
“I thought it was very funny, and I thought the audience that they portrayed was totally real, but the actors that they were pretending to be were totally unrecognizable. Certainly I don’t know what Tim Allen was doing. He seemed to be the head of a group of actors and for the life of me I was trying to understand who he was imitating. The only one I recognized was the girl playing Nichelle Nichols.” – William Shatner
What a gorgeous fucking day
hey just a question, anyone know when season 3 of my little pony will be out?
XD
WOOO PONIES
eww, ponies
Yes, the movie started quite slow
ponies!
PONIES
8/10 was amusing
Ponies.
zombie ponies <3
Wait
the trotting dead!
Apokalipse, ikr
Silver: "It's GORGEOUS!
“I loved Galaxy Quest. I thought it was brilliant satire, not only of Trek, but of fandom in general. The only thing I wish they had done was cast me in it, and have me play a freaky fanboy who keeps screaming at the actor who played “the kid” about how awful it was that there was a kid on the spaceship. Alas.” – Wil Wheaton
∈R/10
oh hey this epsoe
Bluemario2: No. Don't get your jimmes rustled
mlp is best show
k
Twillight sounds off
pony
“I think it’s a chillingly realistic documentary [laughs]. The details in it, I recognized every one of them. It is a powerful piece of documentary filmmaking. And I do believe that when we get kidnapped by aliens, it’s going to be the genuine, true Star Trek fans who will save the day. I was rolling in the aisles. And Tim Allen had that Shatner-esque swagger down pat. And I roared when the shirt came off, and Sigourney rolls her eyes and says
October prolly, you see hub said less than 30 days untill they anounce when it begins
and hwere in equestria do these rolling bushes suddenly com,e from
Zombies!!!!

ALONE IN THE DARK
01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: This is THE sci-fi comedy movie. I honestly can not think of a movie as good as this. Perfectly cast, perfectly performed, perfectly shot. The story is believable for its setting, its characters enjoyable and memorable, the comedy is spot on, the references are great for any sci-fi lover, and its effects are pretty damn good for being made in the late 1990's.
1,1110/10
<sketch_toku_bronjy> I would watch that move so HARD
Oh hi Applebloom
Whose footprints are these
Dang it Caramel you skipped the credits I would have spaced out those Trek actor quotes
:$ the emocations are ponies
nice
shes got lazer eyes, beware!
Sup Zeccora?
question, why does she have glowing eyes?
Silverscreen: So...Space Balls is the B Sci Fi Movie, but the A is Galaxy Quest, Silverscreen ?
General_Kerr: You must be new here.
Zecorra is best pony
It was good
i only know this episode in german.... hope its better in english...
Lil_B: lazer eyes dammit!
I liked it
/me goes get foods!
brony90: much much better :D
Awesome.
/me pokes GilDash
is this have color correction? the colors seem more saturated
Caramel: r u here?
TrollFace no wonder she's feared than :/
Zeccora is best Zebra
Vordox, Galaxy Quest has Alan Rickman in it, QED A Movie.
brony90: Often the original is best
zecira ;D
DuskStarshimmer: Holla! :)
01,11As a general rule, I put most comedies on a B list level due to the jokes and comedian's talent being the highlight of the film. This is one of the rare comedy movies that defy that rule, and as such it's one of the rare comedies that I count as an A list film.
Liked it.
Man Twillight sounds off
11,01Space Jam, not Space Balls sadly.
Lil_B: yeah, noone likes xman copies
SpaceBalls is a parody of Star Wars. Galaxy Quest is parody of SF fandom in general.
*zecora
Silverscreen: Sounds good.
Space Jam is fun
Dester: Seing as she's the only Zebra, she's also the worst zebra
11,01Even though Spaceballs > Space Jam.
01,11Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs are kinda funny, but since they are entirely focused on being a satire rather than making their own original story, I don't think they qualify as an A movie.
Space Jam is great
Derp!
That is the joke
<_<
Silverscreen: Agreed too, but still one of the best B Sci Fi movies. :P
Space Jam's decent.
We got the point pinkie
Nittany_Discord: I think he meant Space Balls was THE ultimate B Sci-Fi film
Space Jam was a petty good movie :3
EEEEVIIIIIILLLLLLL
She's aFrican, hate her
hey has anyone seen the message from twlight sparkle one youtube? I would love it if they put that in place of the intro to one of the episodes
Ponies47: youre a mix betweena hitman and a pony :D
SPACE JAM ROCKS
ok, I'm off until B Movie
Also Galaxy Quest has had most Start Trek actors support it to the point its concidered an unofficial Star Trek film.
As said, a perfect 6/10
she's a black magic woman
I rated it roll/10

Space Jam helped many little boys develop their first crush
I love how I came to love Galaxy Quest with a buncha neat ponies like y'all. cx Geeks geeking about movie geeking about fandom and its geeking.
TrollFace: Nope :$
Nittany_Discord: Don't remind me...
Huh?
Let me get this straight, france exists, ponies speak it eveynow and then, but no one knows about africa
Ponies47: search it dammit! :)
Nittany_Discord: Ikr :(
yeaahhhh song time!

Wait, Everfree Forest is not ruled by the pony master race, and they hate it
I love the english version of the evil enchantress song...
brb
supposedly africa is the everfree forest now...
Wow. Catchy.
I miss the days when Twilight was snarky.

Pegasii control the weather, so why is it weird that when they aren'y around weather happens?
i love when fluttershy sings it XD

Ponyville is likely in Ontario, or Luxembourg.

You got her alright
they need to bring back Flutterguy at some point.Or a pony with his voice....
You know what's funny? Nopony ever told us who voiced Derpy.
Apple Jack talking to Rainbow Dash is essentially rainbow talking to her self.
Or Apple Jack talking to her self
wasn't applejack on zocora?
You think so
Obviously Zecora is speaking in her native language because that's the language that she thinks in her head.
Yes they did Kawaii
and stay outta ponyville ye damn zebra!
Kawaii_icybeauti : I think it was Tabitha St. Germain
Dante: That sounds so wrong
Swahili?
ponies be bitches
And then she speaks in English rhyimg every time
Kick there butt Zecora
i didnt mean it like THAT
Kurra fake swahili

this is a bit... insensitive of an episode isn't it
Awwww. :(

Why not just tell us without rhyming?

And the serious bits
ovious joke there... make em come
THIS GUY IS BAD!!
BIRMINGHAM BARONS
I see where this guy is going wrong. He knows that the people going to his theme park are dissatisfied. So he instantly assumes it's due to a lack of new content.
Lil_B: yeah, but feet licking is apparently big on DA :D
MadSurge ewwww
don't...swing
01,11And now we get the harsh reality of this movie: Michael SUCKS at baseball.
BASEket ball.
He really does.
chicken little refrence
01,11This ain't bad writting, this really happened.
I remember in sixth grade we were watching some Looney Tunes segments....all my peers loved them to my surprise
The guy needs to remodel, revamp, and rebrand his theme park so that it's a fun place to go to.
Lil_B: thank god I don't thread those dark alleys on DA :D
comic relief guy incoming.
HAR... finaly caught a Trixie in ponymon
poor MJ :(
Missed it by an inch
HE'S PURE EVUL

Silverscreen: Given how not as funny the Looney Tunes are here, shoudl Swakhammer even bother with them?
Silverscreen You saw Nc's review of this too? lolz
Michael was too tall to be good for baseball. Strike zone was too big.
*claps* you suck!

The aliens arent that bright are they?
Silverscreen, that makes no sense
^
They're from a place called Moron Mountain.
Trolls Bunny.
It's not that surprising.
Derpy_Hooves: nooope, but they have superior firepower

I like the blue one
I like the way Bugs said "univoise".
DerpyMuffins: they're classy yet ridiculous
01,11God, Stan is more of a cartoon character than the Looney Tunes are in this movie.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Noel Blanc (Mel Blanc's son) was originally booked to provide all of the regular Warner Brothers male cartoon characters' voices.

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: To keep Michael Jordan happy while filming, Warner Bros. built him his own basketball court.
Bill has good reason to fear

Love this movie :)
Silverscreen: your asking questions again.
Vordox I would demand a nice Console and TV to play with if I was a good actor :/
Of a cartoon.
LOL JOHN HANCOCK
dem logic
Weird that they went with the LT characters being in their own world since they're usually portrayed in the real world as actors, like in Back in Action
Dat's just silly
I have several on the shelf but don't have a VCR, so maybe when my plans gain a little more momentum I'll have a go with it
How do they know about Micheal Jordan if he doesn't exist in their world? :S
Silverscreen: He's chasing sever rats obviously
Lil_B: There's so many things I wish to tell you, but that's an opinion :P
If we could logically explain cartoons I think we would know a lot more about the universe

01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Michael Jordan actually wore his college basketball shorts under his Chicago Bulls uniform every game as a good luck charm.
Lola confused me at a young age

New Lola is terrible
SUPA MICHEAL JORDON 3D LAND
MaxTheBrony:I Thought I Saw A Putty Tat! XD

Until The Looney Tunes Show this was like the only major thing she was in. After that it was just comics, video games, a cameo in the Tweety DTV, *gag*Baby Looney Tunes

I don't think that one ever saw the light of day
01,11Then again, I found the entire new Tunes show to be comepletely and utterly annoying rather than funny. :/
I think the last time Kath Soucie did Lola before she was replaced by Kristen Wig was in some Six Flags theme park show where she sang Hips Don't Lie with Bugs
Barbetos|AtWork: :S

YOU WOKE THE GIRL

so i forgot, does MJ actually have kids are were these kids shoed in?
GUESS who is Voicing Lola in Baby Looney Tunes!
Britt McKillip (Baby Looney Tunes),

Daffy is the Dr Lazarus of this movie.
Oh yeahm he was on the first dream team
BRITT McKillip!
YOU ALL KNOW who that is?!

Wut wut
kids are not surprised?
I KNEW it was pony realted
why are they not suprised?
01,11The biggest issue with the looney tunes is that they are so downplayed. They aren't nearly as over-the-top as they are in their original cartoons.
Ofcourse not
They are used to this
They watch TV
lol
Back
CCCP:they think their real
Silverscreen: they're also not particularly funny either
Lola= Terrible R63 Bugs Bunny

O.o
Inb4 awesome announcing.
awesome song
Okay, it was a weird show, but I would consider it an experiment. Like the Korn and wubs thing.
So much variations of critics and ratings from people
finally the part worth watching
01,11Yeeeaa-no. Five players does not equal shutting down the entire season. It'd be KILLER on the sport and the people involved.
Dat Taz :3
Loonatics was just a BIZARRE idea. I mean, who thought Looney Tunes needed a gritty re-imagining?
I find myself to be dancing now
And the furries go nuts with sexy bunny.
Whatever. It'll just mean the season is extended.
RAWRity: Agreed.
I'm suprised Michigan Frog didn't ge more of an apperance here since he was all over the WB Network at the time
Silverscreen What's after Space JAm
lmao
dem jokes..
YEAH GO LOONEYS
Dester: Ponies.
01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In order to fill up the audience from a limited selection of characters, one section was made from actual Looney Tunes. The rest were simply replicated over and over and then "seated" next to each other to create the illusion of a full audience.
YAY
YAY!
who are they?
The two rats!
xD
01,11Dester: After Space Jam, we have more ponies.
That's like if somebody said "Hey, you know those Sonic The Hedgehog games? let's make a dark game where he turns into a werewolf." ...oh wait.

"Secret stuff" :S
Hacks
JESmith71: :D
Michal jordans secret fluids?
You know, if they could do that anyway, why didn't they? for toons, they've got really crappy toon logic.
Tap Water is crystal meth in a bottle in Looney Tunes world.
Last night, we were all calling this steroid abuse
I still think its Pinkie Juice
Why would they want to drink his special fluids?
I was actually thinking about Drugs or Steroids ...
MUSIC
At least Daffy Duck lampshaded it.
So no one there has a problem with taking steroid/ ie cheat?
Winners do drugs.
grrrr
this music
Looney Tunes Logic ACTIVATE
Cripplers Absolutley, rmember berry bonds

So the aliens are cartoons, made b y aliens then?
horrifying
Wait, Bugs and the gang are worried about losing because they have to do the same crap over and over at a theme park? They already do that in real life at Six Flags.
Why don't the aliens just steal jordans talent?
Silverscreen, but they lacked confidence in their abilities, and were intimidated by the Monstarrs. That's why the placebo ploy was needed.
So have i missed anything good the past 2 weeks?
Dat Daffy
Fuckin creepers keep blowing up near me on minecraft on the xbox
Dat Lola <3
Silverscreen: Jordan didnt know they would need any special motivation
this is the scene that lola mostly had personality.
dat save
poor bugs
And the female character has to be saved from a menacing villian
:3
Looks like he got squished like a bug
They have these stupid stage shows with costumed LT characters singing Pop Songs. Like they have Slyvester and Tweety singing Lady Gaga and Lola and Bugs singing Hips Don't Lie
So much for female empowerment

i've seen this like a couple times when i was a kid back then
Fl00t4hSh41, female empowerment or treating a lady like a lady? Does female empowerment mean letting her come to harm?

brb
i know this guy he was off the movie show umm oz mozez Jones or something
He's a better cartoon than Lola at any rate.
So they should "dominate that hole", huh? :S
here's the explanation for Bill Murray being here
producers xD
Kandarihu: Empty bluster. She still needs a man to save her from the villian
Anybody know where I can see the The Room? I love cult classic bad films
So...
The Producers got him in

or in mlp
Marvin then blew up Moron Mountian
Vordox YES! you got the Plan :P
Silverscreen: Don't worry, he had a beak

then MJ breaked the logic and scored
btw I played slenderman , it was not scary at all <.<
What logic?
MaxTheBrony ikr?
MJ is like Pinkie
Not only does Jordan break Physics but llogic as well
If any game is even remotely scary, I'm not playing it. Not for a million bits.
but ofcourse i had Giggle at the ghosties in the background all the time so maybe thats why, but still its a very badly made game .
let's beat these yolks and save my folks by baking the fourth wall!
MJ can slow down time
Did Pinkie direct this movie?

01,11okay, so my review...
so, that was SPACE JAM
COME ON AND SLAM
1,11MEANT to be comedic. The story is pretty lame too, and the movie as a whole suffers from having stuff just not being over-the-top like it should. The only way it's good is through one's nostalgic goggles, reeking heavily of the 90’s scent.
01,11The animation is nice, though, and I honestly wish the Nerdlucks/Monstars became regular Tunes because they’re so original. The soundtrack, needless to say, is awesome, and Bill Murray is always hilarious. However, those are minor and not nearly enough to save what’s wrong with this movie. 4/10.
girl bunny/10
