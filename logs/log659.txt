honestly, I do NOT get why people call Lesson Zero an amazing episode. It's decent at best.
0,14ever
I marathon the show once or twice a year, I don't watch old eps every week
yes, I long for such an episode saxy, sadly it'll take awhile
05,15SpacePretender you're right. I never realized that
00,10oh you meen the pony ep

0,14there's a movie?
0,14I'll, uh, be over THERE
0,14in the corner
but Lesson Zero didn't even have fanservice to garner the attention/metaphorical blowjobs people have been giving it for the last year.
sure it has the GODDAMN OWL, but it also has spike with a moustache

0,14well, we can -m, righ-

night gusy
That's a lot of E's.
~
protip: some people like episodes for reasons other than fanservice
01,11XAX: wat
Right to watching Lesson Zero, suspended. Also, mfw people complain about everyone picking their favorite eps. XD
I don't think it has ever been shown on BS.
Lesson Zero always wins.
but but but but but but but but but HOW?!!!!!
Oh, it was streamed?
it's one of my favs just for the gag/running time density
I'm probably the only one voting for it, too.
But then again, that was sooooo long ago.
Oh leverage.
maybe encores should be removed pre lotto?
This is the first time Lesson Zero's won since i've been voting lotto. I mean it has been shown once or twice outside of BMN
that's why I like it
I actually try to put up various obscure episode
like this week was.....
