hihi
I have to ask. Does the mechas add anything to this anime? Since I remember lots of talking when I ever saw an episode, well part of one, i got board
/me shivers
I have "animate icons" unchecked...
12then sil;ence
He couldn't guess it. Turns out I had chose the wrong word. I was supposed to draw Nemo.

generally not a good thing :P
you might nd2 log out or sth
maybe it was eddie :D
ouch
2,14 because that's the point of the show
/me dances
Possible in theory , but in a real scenario : I would take my wooden machete and bash his brain out !
2,14 it's about Renton growing up and understanding his world
12I just talked to him
2,14 by the end of it, you know EVERYTHING
12so it's possible...
is it sad that
when I heard the word "espionage"
I heard "Espeon-age'
