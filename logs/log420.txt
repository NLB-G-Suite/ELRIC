DAMNIT Calcos323 DID YOU GET INTO MY BLOW!
Well everypony have a good night!
out of the mane six the only ones that dont have siblings are Twilight Fluttershy and Rd
mods
Spike convinces Twi to turn him into a pony so he can go out with Rarity. He finds out that the spell will be permanent if he stays like it too long while going out with Rarity under a different name. rarity finds out and convinces him to change back bc she loves him for who he is. Moral: Be true to yourself.
/me parachutes into the chat and glomps TheRainbowDash, TheHoodyNinja, and MahBoi777
that sayin is true
yesh

hi TwiilightSparkle1
there should be a new internet rule if it exist there is a pony version of it
So whats happening tomorrow since there isnt an episode?

WallDives: but officialy made by anonymous?
'Allo
Ryanier128: I think that is incorrect. Males are X/Y right? WOmen are Y/Y so I figure just replicate teh Y since Men USED to be women right?
/me wonders what the filly eyes are
Everypony type the word "the" if you want to initiate WMC for Aguille.
Rule 85.
Otakon makes a point
Ill show you fapplebloom
Ryanier128: it's sci fi he seems to have the equipment

All the women... MASKED! :D
Oh yeah, how was th e b movie?
I'm in grade 9 science honours
Well I'll be, there are women.
Either way, men can use that

welp i'm off to bed. Good night everypony *takes ff glasses. What? Expecting a CSI joke?
moralfag
12I must disagree somewhat
Spike convinces Twi to turn him into a pony so he can go out with Rarity. He finds out that the spell will be permanent if he stays like it too long while going out with Rarity under a different name. rarity finds out and convinces him to change back bc she loves him for who he is. Moral: Be true to yourself.
Well, no friendship reports for 6 MONTHS O.O
/me pokes caillin
It was going to Be romantic......

Reikim : I could have before I decided to distance myself from Anime
and Jammit, but it's just sitting there
12it knows who you are
so you need to explicitly un stretch it when you want to
It was crazy
XD
ok who replaced Ponys with Gurren Laggen

I need to watch this anime

O_o
otakon: please. i doubt gurren lagan has characters like pain
Jewel: This is actually from the movie version of the anime :)
Jewel: 2 movies and a 26 episode series
Alister: TTGL was one of my last anime. Then I kind of stopped for whatever reason...

12Mario Galaxy IMO
twilight_sprinkle: Gurren Lagann has Kamina and Simon. Your arguments are all invalid, past, present and future.
6_9
:'(
I stopped watching anime years ago
otakon: do you think dbz is better than naruto?
Some people would say MK Wii was good, I strongly disagree
hie FlareChaser!!
hiya FlareChaser how are yo?
MahBoi777: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3oznpq/
FlareChaser: Hi
Someone should find the movie to this anime and show it next time on the stream.
Wii Sports is nice
DIE DARK SIDE *Fire burns darkside*
Thank you, much better.
FlareChaser: i chose not to say hi...you meanie
Yes! DBZ is better then Naruto
12eh
lol

/me dances on FlareChaser s head
Reikkim : Yes the action is awesome, altough the gratuitous boobs in the final fight is just stupid
Jewel: lol bullshit.

Hello FlareChaser!
According to Gainax canon, the Super TTGL is 52.8 billion light years tall
twilight_sprinkle: um, DBZ helped INSPIRE Naruto so yes
FlareChaser: NP
I'm a techie, and I like tech demos
12got bored after a short while
There is very few anime that I watch
however
Nartuo is pretty good, but not a favourite of mine

I get shivers EVERY time I see this
Hello everyone that pinged me!
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH EVERYTHING?!
dat large robot
EW NON-FREE WII SPORTS

Thats just ridiculous
Alister: what gratutious boobs? maybe in the movies?
12Twilight Princess is 3rd
Alister: Yeah, I didn't get it either. Decided to focus on the extra Tengen Toppa
!bomb drf|osx
/me puts a bomb in drf|osx's pants! 20 seconds til detonation! Type !cut [colour] to snip the right cord before the bomb explodes! Colours are: Red Green Blue Black White

Twilight Princess is a hacking tool
I have no idea what this stream turned into...
Shane377: O____O
11,02Moo ^-^
12!cut red
otakon: dbz is shit, with primitive characters, 0 development, shitty plot, monotonous fights
Wrong wire! Kaboom! Correct wire was the blue wire!

/me dances with Merc_Xephos on Petrified_Discord s head
FlareChaser: im not tone who keeps insulting scootaloo....
because of RawkSD, rather
Sumica, omg
Have I mentioned that this anime helped me out of near-depression? Because it totally did.
wasn't it originally for the gamecube?
LL
what...:D
that is amazing
The Legend of Link's Distractions, that's all
umm
wait... what?
this is cool music
/me wears those glasses
twilight_sprinkle: it's also been around for over 20 years and is STILL considered one of the best manga and anime franchises. it also inspired friggin Naruto and it's asstons of filler.
I *tried* TP legitimately
12it was released for both at the same time, Umbre
gave up after a day
lol, I loved that anime!
of it being completley retarded side quests
oh
sorry
ALTTP was actually decent
12you didn't even get past the tutorial
wait, constipated ponies
otakon: considered by who? dbz fans?LOL
11,02Sumica: Dat anorexic Chrysalis O.O
Shamroc: Dont worry, I only insult some other pony now.
/me 11,01dulls twilight_sprinkle
SuperBrony64: I know she is
11,01Oops. Sorry twilight_sprinkle
12those weren';t side quests
what is that a tutorial for, stuff that has nothing to do with the game?
(as I turn the steam back on)
Twilight as Kamina......seems legit
DBZ is a classic at this point
Fun fact: It should technically take that battle billions of years because of how slow a being light years tall could possibly move
RAINBOOMED
twilight_sprinkle: let's see if Naruto stands up to the test of time that DBZ has. Also, One Piece.
12that was the tutorial
otakon: TTGL is still the best. No exceptions.
12...
/me 11,01dulls TwiilightSparkle
thanks FlareChaser..
12riding a horse
(all I needed as a few seconds >_<)
I tought Viral (correct if i'm wrong) would have been spike : Non-pony = Non-Spiral
12something you do often
Reikim: thank you, explain that to twilight_sprinkle over there
dulls? im afrain my knowledge of english isnt good enough to come up with a proper reaction Nittany_Discord
Dat was freaking awesome

twilight_sprinkle: Go watch it. Now. Seriously, TTGL outdoes Naruto on every level possible.
:P
Yay science!
/me picks up DeathStar from his head and gives her a bug hug ^-^
Nittany_Discord: are you streaming?
Twilight has evil plans in the future
oh my god, freaky twilight is . . . freaky

imma see these guys this summer
11,01I use Rainbow Dash as a watermark when I stream.
twilight_sprinkle: therefore, if DBZ is STILL BEING SHOWN 20 years later and has come out numerous times then it is considered classic at this point.
LunaTheBeloved: ill tell you when its over
12you prolly mshould, Danny
Alister: I shall slap you.

Shane377: hugs?

The only issue I had with Naruto is when he does stupid things. LIKE NOT HAVE NARUTO TALK TO HINATA ABOUT THE CONFESSION!
wooo
Back and guessed it

Damn you mangaka of Naruto!
/me huggles LunaTheBeloved back "Moo moo MOOOO ^_^"
SuperBrony64: Why no glomp for us?:| - Cows

yes
otakon: what is with you dbz fans? all you can say is "naruto-goku derp derp" so what??? what does that change about their quality?
I AM NOT GAY man thats funny
twilight_sprinkle: well then, TTGL would NOT be boring since it DOES have character growth and a interesting setting as well as bombastic fight scenes that just get bigger and better.
:3
I need soem microsoft points...
so I'm guessing Windows key is the same as the Apple key?
Reikim: have you watched coede geass?

Or I could get the collectors edition

Sorry Cadance your love is in a different castle
twilight_sprinkle: Yep. Loved it to bits.
pfft naruto is best cartoon dragonball is for little girls (please notice my sarcasm)
Goku is more like Luffy than Naruto anyway.
and yeah
twilight_sprinkle: nevermind, you cna like Naruto and I can like DBZ and let's just let it be.
It seems that Murderface got retooled into a likable character.
My hard drive that had Windows on it broke

imma go to bed goodnight everypony! :)
Oh DBZ, how I used to love that show
/me puts DeathStar on stage and charges admission
twilight_sprinkle: Then listen to me, who has watched Code Geass, and never DBZ. Code Geass and TTGL are pretty even in my opinion. Code Geass is its own thing, I enjoy it, and it owns. Gurren Lagann is the epitome of Super Robot, and helped me out of depression.
bye mario_pony!!
otakon x hotdogs
Night mario_pony

Alister: Still spreading the word.
Reikim: i still dont like you calling naruto shit. with characters like nagato, naruto isnt shit.
/me puts DeathStar behind a one-way mirror
twilight_sprinkle: I'm NOT being biased, you just straight up said I have no taste bc I like DBZ. I DIDN'T call Naruto shit, I just said it's prentencious filler with emo pretty boys.
but its expensive
That convo sounds liek something Caillin / DeathStar woulds say
08,01guess who my new favourite character is?

hence why I bought that one and not the cheaper ones
I should probably go to sleep... -_-
since it's 3.10
cause i dont sleep on the weekends... only during school and weeknights
a shame that I'm only watching 2 animes this spring *looks for more new shows*
Ponies the Guiles theme of tv shows
twilight_sprinkle: I still contend however that TTGL is one of the most over the top awe inspiring manly tears anime ever.
emangamer, what time is it for you?
otakon: you can like it if you want, just dont make judgements about quality about something youre so biased about.
TheRandomkid321: You were very aptly named, werent you

FlareChaser: just wondering

http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3701/
08,01poor chrysalis
I hate it as much as you do XD
otakon: i mean animes shuldnt do fan service
twilight_sprinkle: there is fanservice but it's pretty well just tongue in cheek stuff in TTGL. Plus it's gainax, fanservice is almost guaranteed for anything they make.
TheHoodyNinja: ^
TheHoodyNinja eeyup
TheHoodyNinja, nope.
08,01she just wants tobe loved
...NEXT: First person who makes a Scootaloo Joke wins a kick in the face by Shamroc.
but my main laptop hard drive is broken
and I'm at home
08,01i'll love you, chrysalis!
so I'm stuck with this one
TheHoodyNinja: let me say that's your opinion and I respect it
Dat RD

08,01*i'll
i was dinged
TheHoodyNinja|Happy: indeed
and I'd rather not wipe out this working OSX installation, since it took me forever to get it to work
I think fanservice is fanservice even if it's tongue in cheek
dock?
twilight_sprinkle: there is nothing wrong with a bit of fanservice if it's tasteful.
Shamroc
I just stuffed my face into the pie... Bad idea
oh theres the ding
Shamroc?
Shamroc
/me 11,01writes
Eiken=GOES TOO DAMN FAR!
unless if it's trolling fan service
Shamroc
... doesnt help me at all
otakon: changes nothing, a good anime doesnt need fan service

who said it would
FlareChaser: Why did Scootaloo cross the road? to get to the other side!

DeathStar: tru dat

twilight_sprinkle: but that doesn't mean good anime doesn't have some fanservice in it. Naruto has fanservice, so by your statement are you saying Naruto is NOT a good anime?
First person to link me MOAR Colgate gets a hug from SuperBrony64.
Shane377: this is a fact, lol
/me dances on Bronysith s head

Not cool bro

08,01Chrysalis is like pony Kerrigan
No you didn't

08,01Alister: clearly, we should make out
i said o god

I love how OSX lets you move in-use DMG files to the trash
sry
otakon: only a few jokes, not anything for the sake of fan service.
he does cocaine
O god != NSFW
hang on one second
I am cocaine
twilight_sprinkle: so does TTGL
THAT DOESN'T MEAN NSFW
and then just yells at you if you try to empty the trash
Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine is nothing but fanservice.

MahBoi777: Can you send me the link again? I can't click it or highlight it cus the chat's moving too fast :P
Nittany_Discord: eeyup, but I swear we've shown this hear already
oh eureka 7 aparently
I instantly thought of a certain parody using this intro
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1608/
eureka seven. theres a sequel to this anime
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1608/
Eureka 7? I think I heard of it..never watched it though.
otakon: idk, i see nothing wrong with debating, as long as its objective and you dont insult
/me attemps to sing along but ends up saying extremely racist phrases

Woo!
Hey kids! Sorry to burst your bubble, but Darker than Black is the best anime of all time.
I never got into E7 if only because they never seem to explain WHAT THE HELL is going on and why. I STILL don't know what L.F.O. means

cya spacemarshmellow
I still wish to see Wakfu in here
bai spacemarshmellow
CAN WE WATCH MARIO STUFF?
this is a good show
TOO MANY LINKS!
Fucking robots, what isn't japanese anime about?
MahBoi777: lol disorderlyconduct is awesome :D
TheHoodyNinja: My understand is, it is a show about mechas, with some love triangles or something
gud nyt spacemashmellow
IKR
Night spacemarshmellow don't let NMM or Molestia bite
Jewel: YAY JAPAN!
FlareChaser : Imma really happy for you Imma let you finish BUT CARTOONS WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER THAN ANIME !
Dashie_Dashie: its not about ponies
Krakass: um, hell no. THat's like saying Friendhip is Magic is the same as generations 1-3
JoseEnriquez i want molestia and lunaughty
Anypony else having issues viewing any Mylittlfacewhen linkS?

Alister, if you dont shut the FUCK up, I am going to...
:O
Japan is great. And everything they produce is whole some and wonderful.
lol Lunaughty > Molestia
Bronysith : Can you leave me Lunaughty ?
I love this anime!
08,01Krakass: squee
it was my first!!!!
Dashie_Dashie: naruto doesnt involve robots, i dont think bleach does either
I already call dibs
Dashie_Dashie: the japanese LOVE their giant robots. Remember? I DIG GIANT ROBOTS!
They're not?
That_Irish_Guy: Aww yeah! Rainbow Death incoming....:)
Alister dude ill probably be passed out after a while so yea
Alister: animes are cartoons silly :)
ah, japanese rap
who's streaming?!!
FlareChaser : It's like we're two opposites
2,14 I am
i have no idea what the hell its about
Alister: Screw this, /ignore
Alister i mean damn they use magic to please all the nerves
/me facepalms
perfect camouflage for a gunfight in a kindergarten
/me not sure if trolling or serious
otakon: all im seeing right now is GIANT ROBOTS THAT SHOOT LAZERS....
/me rubs her eyes and yawns
/me dances
/me luffs on ValtheJean
LunaTheBeloved: want me to get your blanket box?
Bronysith : YES ! GIVE IT NOW
Its getting late...
Shamroc: that is NOT all there is to E7, it's actually very character heavy
08,01Krakass: squee
however,I find the characters very uninteresting
08,01but i need to go to beeeeehehehed
otakon...i cant make that observation from just the opening... lol
So much Chrysalis!
/me dances like an emo kid next too DeathStar
so this anime is about giant robots on sky boards that leave yellow trails of light?
08,01UnFoundBug: squee
Petrified_Discord: needs moar Discord
Shamroc: just like the Teens React in retrospect
twilight_sprinkle: SURE why the hell not?

/me gets out her blanket box
Kandarihu: I love anime as well, but that was a joke...
2,14 twilight_sprinkle: heh...yeah, the opening sequences do NOT represent the show well
I always judge a book by its cover and a show by its opening.
Bed time methinks....
LunaTheBeloved: wait where was that?
oh
twilight_sprinkle: that's actually a side point, the show itself is VERY character heavy
I figured out the weird noises
Shamroc, Secrets
Under the couch I think
HOW DARE THEY MIX THOSE ANGRY REVIEWERS PEICE OF SHIT WITH MY PONIES
ValtheJean: you mean like MLP:FIM?
it's my mic, apparently it's set to play through the speakers
so if I move my hand over it
hey i gotta go to bed guys but remember http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/992/

FlareChaser, why you tease us with your filly?
Goodnight everyone.

For those going to sleep http://imgur.com/1Duaf
So I was playing DrawSomething with my buddy.
FlareChaser: are....are u talking to urself?:$
bye carl Marx
:3
Alister: Do you want me to murder you in your sleep? :)
bree :3
I spent 15 minutes drawing an intricately detailed space shuttle.
hihi
Silent Hill is too creepy
hi jacktheripper
I have to ask. Does the mechas add anything to this anime? Since I remember lots of talking when I ever saw an episode, well part of one, i got board
/me shivers
I have "animate icons" unchecked...
12I knocked on this door
FlareChaser : Murder me with what a toothbrush ?
Night Marx
12then sil;ence
He couldn't guess it. Turns out I had chose the wrong word. I was supposed to draw Nemo.
AWW SH^T AUSTRALIA
Alister: That is possible.:P
ValtheJean: I never was able to get into this show, if only becuase they explain NOTHING in the first episode and bombard you with new terms that you have to guess to.
12suddently, there was a loud bang
headshot
Alister: it's possible
12I jumped
Petrified_Discord: that first one:D
generally not a good thing :P
you might nd2 log out or sth
Bye Marx! (kisses you)
maybe it was eddie :D
lol deathklok band is so stupid
ouch
ValtheJean: I still don't know what a LFO is
Alister: Shut..the..fuck...up.
2,14 Otakon: that's unfortunate
2,14 because that's the point of the show
/me dances
Possible in theory , but in a real scenario : I would take my wooden machete and bash his brain out !
2,14 it's about Renton growing up and understanding his world
ValtheJean: plus, I don't like those little brats. They need a good beating
12I just talked to him
2,14 by the end of it, you know EVERYTHING
12so it's possible...
11,01I'm tired; heading to bed.
/me pokes DeathStar
So... what is this show about?

Jewel, METALLLLLLLLLLL
ValtheJean: yeah, but at the very least I shouldn['t have to wait until the last ep to find out what the hell LFO means.
Bye Nittany_Discord
cya Nittany_Discord
What the hell is wrong with that guy?
07yes.
These names get so damn ridiculous
Night Nittany_Discord

/me dances on MahBoi777 s head
Steam for OSX is even more broken than the Windows version
.___. no ^
the app icon looks like an X
I've got a new goal in life
TheRandomkid321: That is one weird thought
let's be clear
TheRandomkid321: they would be tough and stringy
or rather, has a "do not enter' style sign where an icon shoudl be
is that really steam
or is it x-chat?
/me hides
Who are these people and why do they care about Death Clock?
it's Steam
Is that guy's job just to shoot down the council's warnings?
/me grabs hunting rifle
Dashie_Dashie: What, you got a problem with dancing?
MahBoi777: dose it involve dance because I could help with that
Alister: Who the fuck said I had a toothbrush? I have a fucking gravity gun.
11,01Alister: Leave FlareChaser alone.
Why are we talking about how wings taste?:P
^
it was about that
@Nitanny_Discord : we're joking !
Jewel: bc DethKlok music is SO influential on the world it affects the globes economy
Wat
http://i.imgur.com/v5lPV.jpg
ummm
see?
11,01Not from what I'm being told.
2,14 Otakon: it's a LOT sooner than the last episode you find out what an LFO is :P
and it's weird because I have it open, too
whut
/me dances
DeathStar: LOL no, but that's a good idea, I'm going to make a wooden toaster for no raisin:P
What the *bew!* ?
TherainbowDash Im determined to find out what pegasi wings taste like. And im determined to fidn out. *loads rifle*
11,01So please stop.
@Nitanny_Discord : and who is telling you that ?
Thank you Nittany_Discord.
It's going to be ok emangamer. She'll be back tomorrow.

MahBoi777: awesome!

/me runs
uh
thats the "you can't run this" badge

11,01FlareChaser doesn't like you calling him names. Sorry.
looks like alister is arguing with the mods again
hey guys
how do I make hte mic not play through speak9ers
without muting speakers
TheRandomkid321: Umm, I'm good for today....*flies away*
hey dentidiot!
ValtheJean: I watched it on Adult Swim for a week, it did NOT show me what LFO means, or even set up WHY the world is like how it is really. I was left with tons of unaswered questions really.
0_0 wat is this?
MahBoi777: just make sure it can hold a dancing deathstar
-_- 2012 : Can't even make jokes anymore
if you restart or w/e the badge might go away
It's not nice :|
Wait is the guitar rift I am hearing blocking swaring?

TheRainboDash Oh I dotn care. plenty of bg ponies to take out.
Jewel: eeyup
Hey ValtheJean, are you going to be streaming any more Red Dwarf tonight? Or just Metalocalypse?
yes
11,01Well.

DeathStar: noted xD
2,14 well, then you missed the point of the show. Because that stuff isn't even important
/me aims rifle
I thought it was some weird arty thing, I was hearing it so often
11,01Some people get jokes.
2,14 Kandarihu: nah, streamed enough Red Dwarf for now
"The average person spends as much time in the bathroom as [something else here, I forget], so get Tic-Tacs"
Yeah, OK, next time I have to pee I'll use a box of tic-tacs?

Dat Deathclok
ValtheJean: Ok Mitch, thanks for streaming deathklok
Hey, Dashie.
Hi Ninjazz
This show is just confusing
ValtheJean: and yet they fly those crazy ass things at least once in a episode. I know it's a character driven series but I feel the cast of main characters is so large that I can't really focus on liking anyone really. I found Renton a whiny little kid myself, I felt like he had little character growth or at least rEALLY slow character growth. But that's just me, I don't think it's a bad show it's just...........slow I thi
Hey, Alister!
HEY Ninjazz!
otakon: dat wall.
12...a prison
MAHBOI!
12why doesn't that suprise me
/me fires
2,14 it's slow character growth because the show is about him growing up

Nice wall text, otakon.

Yep, somewhere around September 2011 for me. A few weeks after my brithday, 8/29
I was skeptical
Dis
wut?
MahBoi777, Thems the days
ikr?
I started watching MLP a little over a year ago, but didn't get into it until a few days before Best Night Ever aired
00,10I have streamed alot havent i
I watched the show around December but became a brony around the beginning of March
We tend to have many diverse interests. Muchlike the US Special FOrces, except not as many guns.
I first saw Pony reaction images in the 13000+ post sticky on /b/ "Japan Sinks in Ocean: Wat do?" I had not been on /b/ before then while ponies existed.
I like that we all have the same passion for ponies, but we also have our own interests
^
Indeed
i become a brony i'd say in early march
00,10sounds like sim speak
I know of an actual bro
who is a brony
this year
like, he's really into sports, frat dude
I'm the only brony I know irl.
Eeyup. I wanted to see what the "asshole of the internet" was reacting like to the Japan disaster. Saw all those wonderful ponies, and had to learn more.
I remember seeing Ponies on /b/ and thinking nothing of it, calling straight up faggotry. A few weeks later, A friend (total /b/tard) forced me to watch the 1st episode, and I was hooked.
I know about one or two bronies myself
norht carolina
I know a couple
Pretty much in the middle of season one for me
but none are as into it
And I was a hater.
Actually, she was a brony before I
My friend
Man, that has to be the 15th time I said that.
I didn't hate the show or anyone that watched it at first
Well, it is rather late, and I have to sleep for more awesome time tomorrow. Night all. Also, we forgive you for being a hater and one point Ninjazz.
Oh. I hated it. HATED IT!
RUSSIAN MAN!
I avoid /b/, but I am well aware of it. It shocked me to see people persisting in this love and tollerance thing, depite the persecution. It was BEAUTIFUL! :)
00,10cool cat
Thanks, Jake. ^^
Guile's Theme Goes With Sonic Rainboom got me into ponies
Goodnight.
Goodnight Jaketehsnake :)
gnight Jaketehsnake! take care
Allo RAWRity.
more anime? Huh
bye Ninjazz
nite Jaketehsnake
My brony story is complex thats why I wrote it down.
Oh hey RAWRity :)
RAWRity, welcome.
/me just got back from watching a bunch of new anime from this season.
bye Jaketehsnake
lawl
Twi_Fi: I'm not leaving!
hey RAWRity
I honestly thought the pony general was a sticky, till I realized it was just THAT DAMN POPULAR as to persistently stay on page 1! LOL :D
Ninjazz, Save a copy for me, I'd love to read it in the Mornin'
Ninjazz: lol so many fails
Any, see y'all
Rainbow Dash always putting on the ritz
:P
action..
Is it bad this my first time seeing Cowboy Bebop
To be honest, to some small extent, Love and Tolerance started out as a sort of a troll. Noting bugs a hater so much as somepont who refuses to return the hate.
LOLWUT?
good night!
Jackjone: Yes. Just a little.
FaithHeart, you leaving?
I'm going to have to head out. I got a luncheon to attend in the afternoon
Alright, Cya FaithHeart.
it's for my mom's friend's grandaughter's holy communiion
I saw trolling, and I saw gnuine L&T. The fact that it was on /b/ amazed me! :)
aaahh Faithheart
dat failure
I'll be back for Euro movie night
Crackle?
da faq
...
HAHA
if the chat is still going on
Ewww.
wtf?
creepy
So who all is ready for the first saturday without new ponies?
bye FaithHeart! come back later!
I will :)
00,10chat is almost always going
bai FaithHeart
Pinkie Promise
In order I watched "Haiyore! Nyaruko-San", "Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine" "Mysterious Girlfriend X" "Polar Bear's Cafe" "Accel World" "Kids on the Slope" and "Eureka 7 Ao Astral Ocean"
RX-78-SweetieBot: I ain't. :(
RX-78-SweetieBot: We've had ponyless Saturdays before
Oh, FUUUUU--
:D
derp
oh oh
RAWRity: Dat Lupin III
:P
Oh yeah. See you later FaithHeart :)
:D
knifes are fun
use a dead ringer
inb4 gringo
I think a lot of people still think it's a form of trolling. For me it's not. I've noticed that L&T has faltered as non /b/ and /co/ people came in as the fandom grew. A lot of us take it seriously.
stabby stabby
00,10So more or less every new anime this spring RAWRity
Polydunami: but this is the begining of a drought
is it just me or the stream is kinda laggy?
good night everyone! Thank you for making me feel so welcome here :)
not on my end
Drought??? HAHAHAHA! :D
True... but we still have ponies on youtube
YamaTHou: hit the refresh on the bottom
"Haiyore! Nyaruko-San" was about Cthullhu taking the form of a moe school girl coming to earth to protect our entertainment industry from space demons, all while making Kamen Rider references.
YamaTHou: Use the refresh button beneath the video stream.
boom
It was pretty meh.
Sounds like Japanese anime.
RAWRity, wait, what?
Understandable
/me is watching season 2 episode 25-26 " i just love the songs in there '
great songs
DOG!
I really enjoy whatchamacallit... This Day Oreo?
meow?
Polydunami: Aria*
Wait, This Day Aria. My bad :$
This day aria
/me this day aria must of listened to it bout a hundred times now god i cant get enough
00,10not seeing any lag but the frame rate seems low
"Lupin III" was pretty cool. I never watched much of the original, but it was a fun episode, and the animation's buy the director of "Redline" so it looked fantastic.
/me did that on purpose ;)
I LOVE Lupin III
<3
The delay tonight is so low! I'm surprised.
Mica
someone said Lupin III?
LOL I like Oreos
SO freakin short!
...
OH MY!
oh myyyyyy
"Mysterioius Girlfriend X" was about a guy falling in love with a girl after becoming addicted to her saliva. It was surprisingly intriguing. Bizarre, but very interesting.
Oh my
scared the shit outta me O.o
00,10so you all want to see the first ep of the new lupin III then?
YES
Oh My
Sumica: Do what you will
interested
Sumica: sure
YAY
yay
:D
NEW /)O_O(\
lupin III? whazzat?
yay?
I read the manga Mysterious Girlfriend X. Spoiler: …?
Her lipstick.... U___U
...
dat failure
bebop time
-_-
derpy cross eyed cat
Mew.

Tovler|depressed: yeah, just watche dthe first ep... Not sure what to say, but i'm curious to see where it goes.
Do Ano Hana one day
meow
OMG
00,10I have your cat on my head, your argument is invaled
o.o
so is this person a dude or a dudette the voice confuses me
Dat METAL
I understand
dudette
i think
[[['[;[;
Spectrum_Rush: You'll find out
"Polar Bear's Cafe" was okay. Cute, but pretty slow, and not really something I'd be interested in watching. The entire joke is taht a polar bear and a panda bear own a cafe in the human world.
[]
00,10blond is a woman
[][]
Polydunami: oh lawd
[.][.]
\m/
I was wreked XD
soo who wants to try and guess VT's name
I assumed blond was a gay guy
I got bored of Polar Bear cafe fast, but its still light and enjoyable.
The anime this season doesn't seem like anything I'd really be interested in.
ACS13123: You got Mica'd
"Accel World" is really neat. THink .Hack// meets Gurren Lagann
OHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYY
me either the anime is ok ok
I'd guess... But I have maybe seen this episode a dozen time, so I shall... OH MY
this season
00,10got that one too RAWRity
Sounds good.
Medaka Box… I'm only watching it because its 50+ episodes. Maybe it'll pick up.
I haven't watched any anime lately outside of in here
dem space truckers
Sumica: you aren't running the latest script: 5 messages in 10s == kick
:p
just sayin'
yay :(
Wrek switched to six
Again
Thought it was 6 messages?
Kids on the Slope seems alright. But not really my thing. It's about 2 guys apparently becoming jazz musicaions, and it's gotten a lot of praise amongst reviewers, but it's not to my tastes I suppose.
Good...
oooh like's we got us aconvoy
Dat Jazz
00,10eh, what's that MakerDusk?
richfiles_tablet: unlimited for me :p
I need to check out Jormungand.
We got a mighty convoy rockin through the night
CONNNNNNNVOOOOOY
Sumica: wasn't this week's standard 5 messages in 10s?
new season of Kore wa zombie desu ka is good
dat jazzy chase music :3
y\y
00,10that's just wrek
yay*
So far, the only anime that I can't wait to watch every week is Lupin III.
Eureka 7 Ao Astal Ocean was...well, I think ti would make a lot more sense if I'd watched Eureka 7. It's very, very pretty though.
I thought Wrek switched back to the six script?
lolololo
00,10he might have
I didn't like Eureka 7... It was boring to me.
I hear there is a new Eureka 7. Hope it was good! :)
the other way was more interesting
00,10and the new eurika 7 is't the same story line just same universe
even Dari got kicked for it XD
I bought the HORSE MAURE out of that. First release box sets and everything@!!!@3223one
Sumica: there's a new Eurika 7?
00,10that was cause no one gave wrek the version that had exceptions
Although Mysterious Girlfriend X enchanted me so much that I ended up reading the manga.
I'm only reading manga latelyt
are you shitting me?
*lately
00,10yeah there is
Sumica: I know, but I get the feeling there's a lot of stuff I'm missing for not having watched the original
no fluttershy
not yay
Sumica: seriously?
NOT YAY
/me drinks gasoline and lights himself on fire.
00,10Val already called that one so i cant help you there
yay
well, there goes my free time XD
yay
00,10and yes MakerDusk
>mfw I didn't know there was a new Eureka 7 until now.
MakerDusk: yep, Eureka 7 Ao Astral Ocean
00,10it just started this spring anime seasion
...
dat face
Midnight_Tempest! the reason for the buckets and the brooms
Finding Eureka 7 online was what prompted me to kill cable for 3 years. :)
I used to watch One Piece regularly and I picked the manga up
Now it's only the manga
Mutterguy: yup... I MAKE ALL THE MESSES!
must download new anime...
...
...Eureka 7 was my first
watch Black Lagoon...
not yay....
it always gets worse
Dude, Black Lagoon is awesome
00,10[gg] can sit and spin on it
Fruits Basket is AWESUME!!!
watch Gundam UC
/me gives Midnight_Tempest a hug in a water soaked dressing gown to avoid combustion
I was BLOWN AWAY when I discovered Hulu+ has Captain Harlock!!! :O :)
Heh. My first anime was the NBC broadcasts of Astro Boy back in the 60's.
So yeah, there's 3 new anime I plan on following, at least for a bit: Accel World, Lupin III, and Mysterious Girlfriend X. I might check out Jormungand too, since the premise sounds neat.
00,10Macross was the first i ever saw
You know what's online? The Tick (Live-action)
/me hugs Mutterguy back and gives him the look from Jurassic Park. 'Clever girl...'
Sailor moon or Samuri pizzacats. Unless Transformers count
also, the part of me with morbid curiosity wants to look up Upotte!! just to see how bod it can get.
*bad
RAWRity: My morbid curiosity leads me to Seikon no Qwaser and that's all I have to say about that
I mean it
RAWRity that anime is so FUNNY
dat space
w8 what??
NO!
wouldnt your eyes still burst?
well, according to physics, his blood has already boiled
i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone

I don't even want to get near that anime
Goodnight TheGreatAndPowerfulT ;)

I watched Seikon No Qwasar for the plot.
BOOM
I mean, it's a bout girls who are LITERAL GUNS.
Hint hint?

Spike is rather remarkable...
For the plot? Please...
and their triggers are EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D THINK THEY ARE
me gusta
oh look. Episode 4 of Korra is out.
RAWRity: Someone showed me that...it was...yeah :/
Dear lord...
You'd think that's not the point of Seikon no Qwaser
how could I NOT watch an episode of that?
manyuu hikenchou
Oh yeah, I forgot Korra was being aired
Silly me
..k..
damn it RAWRity i wanna look
00,10so yeah this should prove.....intersting
Welcome to the internet, fellows

haha
I am so confused and conflicted about non pony plot! :O
Welcome to the Jungle, we've got fun and games
funfact: FLCL was the first anime I ever watched. I was 8 and caught it on adult swim.
Polydunami prefers to stick to his own kind: humans
Seikon no Qwaser is all about Milk in the end :D
Something, something, something, cause I can't remember the words

Stardust_Phoenix: I think it's pretty neat.

Lupin the Third is a pretty popular cartoon in Italy
It's really closer to the original manga , I think.
dat ass
a "new game"
They really did work on her nether regions...
plus Jigen Daisuke is badass in this iteration.
it's different, certainly, but the frenetic style fits the show pretty well IMO

bai Jackbone
Goemon is the shit.
4Kids would not TOUCH this show with a ten foot Lithuanian.
I kinda like this...
/me Wiggles Eyebrows
It's apparently the newest incarnation of Lupin the 3rd
00,10guss I better pick up more eps for fridays
Whats Goemon?
Jackjone*
Dark_Horst: Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine
4kids wouldn't go near this because, you know, not for kids?
This is something Adult Swim MIGHT show, if they censor a hell lot of it.
They went near One Piece though
One Piece was for kids, though
Lupin III is a lil mature content
Well, older kids but still
considering they showed the old one Ninjazz
Evil_Spike: One Piece's art style made them think it was for kids.
Ninjazz: if it stays in a time slot later than midnight, they dont have to censor too much
they didn't even know what One Piece was when they aquired it
so what's next?
or was that toonami?
more lupin?
RX-78|FireEmblem: True.
I'd be happy if they just brought the old back
Whoa
LALALALALALLALALALLALALALLALALALAL
they quickly found out no, it's for teens, what with all the violence.
