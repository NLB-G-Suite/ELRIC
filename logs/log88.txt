Primeval
12oh dear
Never heard of it, actually
12Anthony appeared
I found it to be a fun sci-fi show.
Think of rifts through time between the past/future and the present, and the monster of the week escapes in the present.
Objective: to kill or to capture.
I'd like to see some of it, at least.
but the creatures come mostly from the past.

good luck.
Anyone here frequent Ponychan?
well hopefully we can get someone to stream it at some point
yes, some of us do frequent ponychan on rare occasions.
I go to Ponychan sometimes, Trony. I know several others here do aswell.
10I only really post in the necessary places for BMN in ponychan
10I don't like image boards
(I dun see Trony in the list no more)
10and yeah, you're right, oh well :3
Prefer forums.
lol yeah he left just after my reply. :P
10xD
/me 10is noob
I prefer forums too, but I don't know of any good FiM forums
More organised and more structured and more rules to abide to. More sane environment.
10i agree with the both of you
10but the main thing is that a lot of posters pretend that they go to imageboards to escape the whole 'post number' and 'forum fame' thing
10but in imageboards you get these horrible social cliques
10and the hierarchy in ponychan especially
10it's ridiculous
hehehehehe
lol yeah, people even actively try to form groups
but oh well, just ignore them :P
10xD
xD
10it wouldn't affect me if it wasn't 1 in 3 threads on ponychan
10so I don't post there, unless it's BMN related now
eh
10^
10:P
I usually stayed in /fic/
10ah fair
10never really been there, to be fair to /fic/
10yarp
10when i say i dont go on ponychan
lol I usually just lurk /merch/ and /art/
Fic is really either threads about fanfic ideas, fanfic reviewers and threads for fanfictions
10i mean i deliberately avoid /chat/ and /oat/ XD
hehehehehe
10through like fimfiction and EqD
yeah
I like EqD because of the prereaders, I guess.
Higher signal to noise ratio than when looking for fanfics elsewhere
10haha sick analogy
10but yeah i agree
10then again I also spend some time just fishing around for random fics
eh
I just don't have the energy to bother with anything else, I guess
Haven't read "Progress: Luna vs" or "Past Sins" yet.
10Soi talks about Past Sins a lot
(yeah, I noticed)
10it seems like a lot of effort though :p
if I missed Season 2, then I'd be worried...
like... really worried...
10I'll most likely be missing season 2 >.>
10I'm moving to uni in... like 6 weeks i think
:O
10which means avoiding ponies for a while
you won't be able to watch on here?
BUGGER
aw damn, that's sad
10Like, I won't be around at all
10but you know, IRL comes first
(maybe I could be appointed as a replacement fer ya? *fluttereyes*)
10XD
yeah, I have to study and work... that kind of has to come first
but thankfully I live on my own and can watch as much ponies as I like :3
yeah, I guess I'll manage to show up even when with College beginning
10I'm moving to my actual uni campus
well... maybe not AS much as I'd like, exactly, but y'know...
(did I type adult... wut)
10XD
10lol you sound a lot older than that
oh wow, I feel old...
10I'm 19 in 3 weeks ^_^
hahahah
I'm super-old McOldface here
ye havent heard me speak french. Voice is a lot higher pitched.
10spit it out :P
I'll be 100 next month
10not EXTREMELY old then ;D
GRATZ!!!
lol no, that's a lie, just turned 30 not long ago
10fair 'nuff
but that's still.... really old
This calls for a celebration! Moar streamers! MOAR streamers MOOOOAR STREAMERS!!! *crow*
10it's not that old for having been alive 30 years
Naw, I'll never be too old for ponies.
î (testan)
10^
lol I was afraid to tell anyone at first
10that was fun
hehehe

I know you're there

10hehehe
10sounds hilarious tbh
10;D
wait
you'Re cosplaying?
or are you making pony merch?
lol no, though I probably could do some cosplay clothes
making pony merch, mostly for my own collection, really
10see if you can get a mini poll up on EqD
are they real size? Or for the pony toys?
10if there's a high demand, then DO EET
brushable size
aah
I like doing tiny things :3
10:D
I think I'll get one of the patterns done first, then I can maybe get a picture up on EqD
first is Pinkie, of course
10hahaa
OFC
10do a special edition of RD's 20% cooler battle armor
10XD
Haha, that'd be pretty cool. Not sure I'm that good with sculpting, though
10hm
10there's gotta be some way you can make it :P
10anyway, brb, drink time
10win
lawl
10awesome
10I think it's the kind of thing that would probably go down well on EqD
Fluttershy and Rarity's dresses definitely look the hardest to make
10and you might get a decent demand if you get posted there at least :3
haahah

maybe the host pulled the plug?

hows you
I just right-click-remove item
not too bad today
I basically nuke everything I don't want on a page
helped him disassemble a shed, move the pieces, and reassemble it
and then had a go in this flight simulator he's built
same here, though adblock plus takes care of like... 99.9% of that
it is a FF add-on called nuke anything enhanced
I can remove anything from ad to text to a selection on screen
oh cool
that does sound useful
but I'm also lazy, I like to have most of it taken care of. :P

A Link to the Past

What'd you learn?
I had cheated to give myself infinite magic, and when I picked up one of the plot coupons, it tried to fill my magic in an infinite loop, forcing me to turn the cheat off.

No idea.
yeah pretty much
Usually at around the same timeframe as fridays
I know, I'm there 24/7
Seriously? Aw Bullocks.
but it is very fun
And live readings too?
Well
And live readings.
(Razyn, the live readings aren't necessarily of quality. Last they read The Rerapening)
No dramatic live reading of spiderses yet?
Why is it unnecessary?
As apposed to something else, like bad?
It's bad.So,SO bad.In the bad sense.
?
Damn.

You don't want to know where I had to plug in my ethernet cable, though....
I can never die too.
but can you beat old age?
I'm 128 years old.
There's this one image I'm trying to find
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Jack_Harkness.jpg
I found it before, but now I can't find it again
I have yet to see a Pony Jack Harkness
Someone should do that
Ok.Harkness is older than me.
(brb,gotta eat)
He can sleep with anything. Men, women, aliens.
and any mix of the three
Not sure that'd make a good pony pic, really....
http://m.artician.com/pu/FJUNMVC4TOAEKSSRZCEHEH63LBGP2XKZ.preview.png seeing that
Oh damn
lol
seems like it could be a mix of the infinity symbol and maybe the male and female symbols
lolwut?
That'd work
18 pages
(to represent his immortality rather than his previous time-agent job)
(i'm back)
brb
I'm back!
really? because that's awesome
yup
That pony from earlier is wierd.
lol oh okay
That would be Jack Harkness pony
and I'm afraid to think he looks like drawn G3 style
haha, yeah I guess a bit, still looks really cool
Jack Harkness now wierds me out.

is there a #BronyState mailing list somewhere?
just email them at the gmail
and ask to be included in the newsletter
12hi drf
I heard they chose Smith because of the American Audiences.
Hello everypony~
hellow
03sigh
03I just wrote a check for $500
aha
Agent Smith?
03for the mailbox that I hit

I heard the main character from the Crank series was gonna be the 11th.
NO ONE is Tennant
03he had some fiberglass thing >_>
except Tennant
...maybe
12x-x
"Where's Applebloom?"

He regenerates.

He has the same memories.
03it's most likely a bootleg.
12well the books are for 2010 version
12so
just call me zekrom
lol
But he's got a different personality each time.
Slightly different personality though
03hm
but the personality changes to fit the actor
He is the same person, and he isn't, at the same time.
gotcha
I have not seen this before
But still the same dude.
it'd kinda be cool if he was the same character though
12i'd prefer that but otherwords
03well
12i don't think i'm actually required to buy it
03if you don't mind sharing a serial with me
I meant personality wise, sorry
03I can give you mine
12well
implied appleblooom in oven
12i don't see the problem in that

13 is out now Reticent lol
Wait.
Is there a fucking time limit too?
yes/no
I see a counter in the top right corner
for bonuses yes.
It's not really a time limit
but its for massive points
If the tiemr runs out that part of the boss dies
there are also spells that need you to run out of time in order to beat them
wtf is that...
no it doesn't die
it just loses the bonus
this is touhou I think
graze, in this iteration, is a point bonus multiplier
I gotta go. Bye!
that's kind of a stupid mechanic imo
no, its deceptively hard, the bullets have their own unique hitboxes
Byeee
TOuhou 12: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7SDCS5KE
knowing where is safe and where isn't takes TON of practice, or really good eyesight
but my point is that it's needless, just make the images as their hitboxes imply
TOuhou 13? No
oh hey
They both had deo versions
but the full versions are out now
no
reticet
TOuhou 06 (This one) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5292071
yeah, but difficulty in that sense just annoys me
is this the same boss????
same boss still.
I just realized
this dud
is using
NO BOMBS.
lunnnnnnies
hi :3
Kind of cheating though.
And Sneas, wtf?
...How?
Using a patch to see the hitbox.
o_O
no
you can see the hitbox in this one
"@VitoZephyr24 there's a patch.
"
You can allways see the cheatbox
Or can't you?
o_p
You can't.
start ESG
>|
umm
Otherwise there wouldn't be a patch for it.
:P
My Touhou 06 always had the hitbox
weird.
All the other ones have it though
that one did have it without the patch
Touhou 7: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5303630
he was focused the whole time...
yeah, normally you need to hold shift 'focus' to see it, take the speed penalty for a little satisfaction
'focused'?
dari
Seems pretty cheap to me.
/me drinks
at the cost of massive speed loss.
which you might need.
No speed cost at the start.
Look.
That's pretty fast.
Hitbox still visible.
yeah...hes right.
12nom
yeah
DAT TOUHOU BGM.
Still, amazing that the player managed it.
mhm
/me returns from work
Kosoveooooooon
Hi
/late
hello again
I have
nice, which one?
6,7,8,10 and 13 on normal
niiiiiiiiice
I still can't beat 12 on normal
i beat 10.5
does that count:D
lol
I came THIS close to beating 8.
Did you get 12.3 Jon?
By the way, since a lot of people here use mibbit, this is rather important for them to know, dari: http://bit.ly/puSjAO
ummm yes
I've beat 6, 7, and 8 on normal
full patched too.
and I've come painfully close to beating 10, I'm working on 11 right now
lol\
Not anything to do with us.
I'll read it later anyway.
/me gives Nick a gold-plated GBA
Actually, Nickserv credentials were obtained
NOOBS EVERYWHERE
I just retype my info each time
NickServ is network specific.
I.E. their NickServ on their mibbit network is completely unrelated to the NickServ on this network.
:O
/me takes and plays Minish Cap on it!

Hi guys
How are you guys?
hey, you gotta admit it that's pretty fucking clever
not to bad barry
Basically, Crown copyright states that anything created by the government or a monarch is permanently copyrighted by the Crown (which is a confusing legal entity that basically means "the monarch of England, Scotland and Wales")
03woah

12drf thinks 2010 is EWWWWW
12but i'm sure it'll be more consistent with the books
2010 is a bit odd
I always knew Sathi was evil!
my insides...they hurt too much from laughing

Has anyone in here done fanfic readings before?
03well
03since EW SATELLITE
03I just use a CableCard and can dump unencrypted premium cable to my hard drive :)
if you lived out in the middle of nowhere with no cable company, you would rethink that stance
its either satellite TV or NO TV AT ALL
03well that's why I don't live in the middle of nowhere
plus satellite is not as bad as you think
03you can't dump streams
does not matter
03my computer is basically a DVR with 10TB of storage
03until satellite companies give you that much..
03I do
03:P
you don't represent all TV viewers
i heard you got hacked?
poor grandma
03yes
03my Xbox Live account
12SilverSonic i herd you like mudkipz
wow, you arent the only one that got hacked
did you have any money stolen
03yes
03well
03not actual money
03but all my MS points were spent
wow
03I already called MS about it and they locked my account for investigation
03I've actually recorded a few movies from Starz HD that do not exist on Blu-Ray or any other HD source
03one being Pokémon 4Ever, and it's not an upscale.
plus you can't do direct stream dumps from AT&T U-Verse
03EW U-VERSE
03See
I don't care
03the lady flat out told us
it works for me
03that = DO NOT WANT
huh
was that the pilot episode?
oh was it just a random one?
12lol
I find that annoying
12speed freak
12he probably goes 30 over the speed limit
gotcha
03more like 50
03I mean
03hi
either way, that was pretty good
12hi
coming in with absolutely no expectations
my download speeds went through the floor
03yeah
well written, good camerawork
03that's the main reason I hate U-Verse, recording asidde
03-d
and the characters are actually interesting
03no dishes to deal with
unlike certain things....
03etc
03My cable company finally got rid of its analog cable
cough gurrdarr cough
03but
oh don't pretend
you loved it
03not really
or right
because I can't find a DVD release
I got the d and the g mixed
although to be fair I am not looking too terribly hard
03the region 1 is incredibly common LOL
I am looking in stores
can't find it
03it's a double-sided disc
034Ever on one side and heroes on the other
I can't put money in or take any out
03but the disc of Heroes is stupid, it's still the crappy 4:3 bluewashed crap
do you have a megaupload account?
INB4 megavideo time runs out.
its in stores or nothing
03well
03go buy a prepaid Visa
03and use it
03:P
I can't get to the store
I can't drive
and have no motorized vehicles
03wow
I have a motorized bicycle which is basically uselsss
*useless
for one thing the engine is Chinese junk where things break quickly
Hmmm... I think I can pitch my voice up high enough for that.
I do have a motor scooter that does not run
a mechanic should be looking at it soon though
lol, megaupload...so much gaff with it
haha
that girl is probably my favorite character
I actually laughed out lout

Such optimism

yup. sucks.
gambel too
All I remember was his "I'm gona go get smashed!" thread
eh, it makes sense given the history
in Europe, alcohol was much more prevalent in common society
literally, European history grew up with it
whereas America
Hurray for prohibition!
and even at one point banned it altogether
Hurray for Canadian alcohol smugglers!
lol
If it was for rum runners we would never have nasscar.
phff, it's the ONLY good mix with alcohol :P
Not sure the drinking here helps anything....
Wait, you mean rum runners are the reason we have nascar?
yep
Dammit!
after they stoped running rum they still loved the raceing
NO GUNZ FOR YOU
any thing full auto is illigal unless you have it grandfathered
as in you had the gun before the law was made
well
only Torchwood can carry guns
that's like saying prostitution is illegal in Vegas
err sorry, legal
squeak.
netsplits
Pinkie Pie is like Deadpool. She understands she is in a cartoon and uses that knowledge to speak to the animators. She's very persuasive which is why she's allowed to break all the rules.
how bout dem ponies?
Naw, Pinkie Pie is just best pony, that's why she's allowed to do whatever she likes.
Pinkie Pie is not best pony. I'm pretty sure we've already covered this.
yup
I concure RD is best
lol
We have covered this, and we discovered that Pinkie Pie was objectively best pony.

I'm thinking RobotPinkie's post is probably the best.
DAT AD
I'll keep looking for a goood frame
althou it's not that good actually
eyes could be wider
Boo
It may just be my imagination, but those two images make it look like Rainbow's looking at the camera seductively
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
it's the best i could do for now, though
>declare war >Doctor >otherside, even if the whole universe, instantly screwed. This is the truth.
eek!
Barry - we're looking for that
but this episode is pretty awesome :P

10:>
I need to snap out of it.
Give me a moment
lol
Bliss?What 'chu talkin' 'bout Dman?
Oh dem deadlock seals
well pega why did you punch yourself?
inb4 Dman makes the vid's soundtrack "Rainbow Dash always dresses in style" repeated over and over
crap!..its 1 am, i need to hit the hay..goodnight everypont!
I punched myself to snap out of it.
I could always edit the eyes on an above picture to make them look at the screen.
epic episode
Dari - i could do that myself, but it's the resolution, man. too low. D:
K-9 being epic.
Seriously dari,can you play my request after this?
Maybe.
do K9 intro after this plzzzzzzzzz
02.-.
"Everything has its time, and everything ends"
From later on or something.
Probably
and a time for every purpose under heaven
...oh wait
feastan
K-9
EPIC
It really is quite biblical, though...
Hey Dman, Dari

Now Giles being epic
AWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

gotch'all
LOL MICKEY

*yes
now, errypony, background.

LOOK FOR A BACKGROUND!
Dman, just use the same background for epic scene
K-9 is BAWS.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO K-9!
;____;
K-9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol, Giles' last words.
Affirmative
affirmative!
Poor K-9
whatabastard
Dman, I agree. Use the same background.
back again
Wait a minute, doesn't K-9 appear later in the show?
/me glompths angel
/me is glomped :3
K-9 does come back.
But I'm just keeping the mood.
Rainbow zooming in wouldn't reveal the hole cropping her would cause, seeing as it fits in the first place
:P
Ok guys i'm gonna vector dis and take out the background
I dunno, Dari?
Dman, then take the same picture again
You don't need another background.
Ok, I'm gonna go look
That's kind of hard to find
You can just crop out Rainbow.
yea i realinse now
if RD only zooms pic is fine
gotcha
OK BROS TIME TA WORK!

13I'm curious, are nickalerts useful?
suddenly, ponies
The first rule is. There are no rules.
13and hai Kosoveon~~
The first rule of ponies.... You talk about ponies.
13Alright then :3 It's just that I've heard some people talk about how nickalerts can be annoying or something
they can be, especially if you have a name/word/phrase that people use a lot |D
guys
The vid. once RD's face zooms in to full screen, it's a little pixely : /
13Well, Angel could be an exception
13but other than that
how pixely is "a little"?
otherwise.. not really.
I'm guessing it's probably fine, unless you want to vectorize the whole thing
Would do, but don't know how. never vectored anything bfore
/ knows a tutorial for me
you can do it semi-automatically
oh?
06and well, I'll be back later n.n
/me hugs AE~
as long as it's a pretty good picture, anyway
how
it's all 'kill everyone to accomplish the objective!'
Inkscape can auto-trace, I'm sure other vector programs can, too
Inkscape?
you just need to erase the background after.... which can be a pain
it good? worth using?
>Sees The Docor's mind
Works both ways
I could try to do it, but I might fail horribly :P
apparently
okay
Dat Title Drop
darnit.
She saw the dancing scene
13D:
and after that you can just link me to the isolated Dash, and I can try to do a vector...
he's BEEN gone for FLIPPIN' hours that's where he IS.

well, link to pic whenever you feel like, Dman. can't promise anything, but I'll try
then dari can show us all

I'm streaming...
I ain't kidding.

I dunno, I'd suggest just removing all transparency and making the background one single color that you can key out
O_o
When did it go offline?
FINALLY
Maybe this could help, Dman: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYwD1rYr8rs

Did you make it a 2px zoom per second?

Dari - ... well, it zooms in pretty slowly
It's something like that I think.
4 min vid
dari, it's like the vid, but a little pixelyer, ONLY a little thou :P
Emphasis on the wrong word. :P
I do believe Karren is defeating them in logic
Granted, ridiculous logic, but still
also sorry doesn't zoom in as much
Awwww
i could do another one where zooms in as far as Tw i does, if someone showed me how to vector image / someone vectors image
I guess think of this as like a v0.1?
V.01 it is
Dman, is the last 5 seconds having RD lowering slowly?
