Reminiscence: the part where Lyon dies
nah
I /probably/ won't kill him off
Fuck, im restarting *sigh* :(
FML
how 'bout Reminiscence: Hell's Carnage or something?
good luck
thanks
04Hell's Carnage?
04Seems a bit...off for Reminiscence
true
not sure
I also still have 'dem kids in high school'
the Reminiscence high school thing
04XD
it's semi-done
Rex and his gang kidnap Seiranyu >:
04get it done then
and then drag her over to KK's office
heh, Drake
think you'll like ch24?
04I dunni
04dunno*
04I'll like it but hate you for killing them
:/
Another side story update.
don't worry
I hate myself too, Drake
04Because you killed off the Hensh?
The people at this hotel are crazy......
5€ for 1 hour of internet.......
04I've also found that it's far easier to kill off or make your own characters go through trauma than it is to watch other people
04's characters die*
no seriously
you know I love my characters, Drake ;_;
I hate myself for killing them ALL off
seriously
Ohai Dashite
I just woke up xD
every single one
except for your char, Lyon
errypony went to bed?
Ohai Dman, I haven't gone to bed yet.
I was considering leaving Leo
but ;-;
04Technically he's your character using my character's name
I would guess so though.
true
but stitl
still*
you know that Kommander Kulesz, The Hensh, Rex, Leonard, Synix etc.
04XD
were my fav characters of all time ;-;
04Didn't you already kill Synix?
yes
but still
anyway brb dinner
04kay
:P
Well im busy putting ebooks on my ds then going so semiafk at the mo
I'll probably be heading to bed shortly.
Oh, and fyi, the italian version of yhe anime pkmn Black and White is insanely non-understandable
;___________; help me
My MSN and FF are STILL not working
because its saying i have an untrusted connection :S
my firewalls are all on
idk what the fuck i did
04Virus?
it might be
but idk :S
/me isnt good with virus knowledge
i dont even know how the fuck i managed to stay on IRC
with this
:S
:(
gonna try to reset my connection
doubt it will help tho
*sigh*
I'm off, so sleep well!
04so?
didnt do anything ;_;'
*sigh*
i dont know how to really get rid of virus
+es
delete everything!
.-.
Well it's one way.
>>
there are smarter ways
i just don't know them
cause i've never had this type of issue before
Sure, but not deleting everything is for pussies
I don't always get viruses, but when I do, I delete everything.
And then I stopped using windows
o________________________________O Ok whaaaaaaaaat the fuuuuuuuuuuuuck, its saying today is 12/31/08

But it is
Also happy new years
brb system restore
I'm back via desktop
:S my laptop i think has gone wacky
im trying system restore on it
im worried i fucked up my laptop
So, basically i flipped out for nothing, the wrong time and date is what caused this problem of my SSL being untrusted

Been checking for a new tv show for dari to stream eventually
And I been thinking Primeval could be good
Oh yeah, I've heard about that
it's a British show, right?
Espeon I'm cringing at my old posts
looks pretty good
anyway
goodnight
goodnight
Hai everybrony
yeah it is a british show RP.
hey Rodman
What british show?
Hi RobotPinkie
Primeval
12oh dear
Never heard of it, actually
I found it to be a fun sci-fi show.
Think of rifts through time between the past/future and the present, and the monster of the week escapes in the present.
Objective: to kill or to capture.
I'd like to see some of it, at least.
but the creatures come mostly from the past.
Though the creators of the show didn't fall in the trap of using only dinosaurs. They used creatures from ALL periods of evolution. There are giant insects too
12hi?
So like... sabertooth tiger and stuff, too?
I guess
as long as people get eaten, I'm happy...
there's a dodo at one point

FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF.
yeah, I guess.
But I loved that show. Very fun to watch.

Anyone here frequent Ponychan?
well hopefully we can get someone to stream it at some point
yes, some of us do frequent ponychan on rare occasions.
I go to Ponychan sometimes, Trony. I know several others here do aswell.
RBD, right now is my standard monday morning.
10I only really post in the necessary places for BMN in ponychan
10I don't like image boards
(I dun see Trony in the list no more)
10But yeah Dermathil, I guess time differences :3
same, RBD.
10and yeah, you're right, oh well :3
Prefer forums.
lol yeah he left just after my reply. :P
10xD
/me 10is noob
I prefer forums too, but I don't know of any good FiM forums
More organised and more structured and more rules to abide to. More sane environment.
10i agree with the both of you
Ya ain't nub, RBD, ya got yer Waifu to help ya
10but the main thing is that a lot of posters pretend that they go to imageboards to escape the whole 'post number' and 'forum fame' thing
image boards can be nice though, you can help pretty quickly with stuff on Ponychan.
10but in imageboards you get these horrible social cliques
10and the hierarchy in ponychan especially
10it's ridiculous
hehehehehe
lol yeah, people even actively try to form groups
but oh well, just ignore them :P
10I couldn't care less about certain posters, and when they're given 'appreciation threads' by whiny little posters who just want their ponychan hero to acknowledge them, that makes me feel disgusting
10xD
x
xD
10it wouldn't affect me if it wasn't 1 in 3 threads on ponychan
10so I don't post there, unless it's BMN related now
eh
I don't go in chat.
10^
10:P
I usually stayed in /fic/
10ah fair
10never really been there, to be fair to /fic/
so I never ever see that stuff.
10yarp
10when i say i dont go on ponychan
lol I usually just lurk /merch/ and /art/
Fic is really either threads about fanfic ideas, fanfic reviewers and threads for fanfictions
10i mean i deliberately avoid /chat/ and /oat/ XD
hehehehehe
10i just read fics really. I've done some pre-reading for friends and stuff too, but I tend to keep that a more private affair
10aside from that I only really read the big public ones
10through like fimfiction and EqD
yeah
I get my fics almost exclusively through EqD
I like EqD because of the prereaders, I guess.
Higher signal to noise ratio than when looking for fanfics elsewhere
10haha sick analogy
10but yeah i agree
10then again I also spend some time just fishing around for random fics
lol I do worry I might miss out on some good stuff
eh
I'm not worried about missing out on stuff. Because I am sure I already do.
I just don't have the energy to bother with anything else, I guess
Haven't read "Progress: Luna vs" or "Past Sins" yet.
so I am sure I am missing out.
10Soi talks about Past Sins a lot
So I ain't worrying.
(yeah, I noticed)
10it seems like a lot of effort though :p
if I missed Season 2, then I'd be worried...
like... really worried...
10I'll most likely be missing season 2 >.>
10I'm moving to uni in... like 6 weeks i think
:O
10which means avoiding ponies for a while
you won't be able to watch on here?
BUGGER
aw damn, that's sad
10or, less avoiding ponies, but just spending less time on the internet in general
what will yer waifu think of that?
10Like, I won't be around at all
10yeah I'll miss all my friends I've made over this summer :3
10but you know, IRL comes first
(maybe I could be appointed as a replacement fer ya? *fluttereyes*)
10XD
!umbreon
yeah, I have to study and work... that kind of has to come first
but thankfully I live on my own and can watch as much ponies as I like :3
10just testing something: - _ * & ^ % $ £ " ! ~ # ' @ : ;
yeah, I guess I'll manage to show up even when with College beginning
10yeah robotpinkie
10I'm moving to my actual uni campus
10so if I'm spending my nights in on the internet, I'm going to be having a shit life
well... maybe not AS much as I'd like, exactly, but y'know...
10well, regardless, that's not what i /want/ to do anyway
hehehe I be happy to live at 3 streets away from the university I hope to go when adult
(did I type adult... wut)
10how old are you dermathil? XD
I'm 12 and what is this?
10XD
16 almost 17 (in liek less than a month?)
10ah safe, your birthday is roughly the same as mine
10lol you sound a lot older than that
oh wow, I feel old...
10I'm 19 in 3 weeks ^_^
hahahah
I'm super-old McOldface here
ye havent heard me speak french. Voice is a lot higher pitched.
10XD how old mr robotpinkie, you might as well
10spit it out :P
I'll be 100 next month
10not EXTREMELY old then ;D
GRATZ!!!
lol no, that's a lie, just turned 30 not long ago
10fair 'nuff
but that's still.... really old
10really old for what?
This calls for a celebration! Moar streamers! MOAR streamers MOOOOAR STREAMERS!!! *crow*
10it's not that old for having been alive 30 years
lol I don't know, old for a brony? :P
^^
Naw, I'll never be too old for ponies.
î (testan)
10i guess it's over the mean average for a brony, but you're not the oldest brony I've ever met
Ah've seen bronys 40s
10^
Well, true, I've talked to guys who are over 40 and bronies
Ah could get my dad to become brony and he'd be over 50
So I don't have to feel that ancient quite yet.
10i have 2 brony friends irl who are both 18
10but that's the extent of who I know irl
I have one potential brony friend, he's 27 I think.
outside my family, I know no brony.
well, nobrony outside the web
10my family wouldn't understand the whole brony thing
10they already know I'm a crazy internet person, but I just think they wouldn't /get/ it XD
lol I was afraid to tell anyone at first
10well it's like everyone knew me as the crazy overweight internet addict a while ago
10but then I started actually living
10that was fun
hehehe
10and when I mention ponies, so far everyone has assumed I'm going back to the dark days
10>.>
HAHAHA
Yeah it's fun to get out some
heyo Dashite
10'lo dashite ^^
I know you're there
haha, sounds like the dark ages

you monster
lol my mom seems almost too excited to help me with my pony dresses
XD
She's into sewing dolls clothes.
makes me feel super-nerdy, but whatever :P
10hehehe
10sounds hilarious tbh
10;D
I took sewing lessons for 6 years, so I'm not exactly a stranger to it.
wait
you'Re cosplaying?
or are you making pony merch?
lol no, though I probably could do some cosplay clothes
making pony merch, mostly for my own collection, really
might sell some gala dresses if people are interested
10see if you can get a mini poll up on EqD
are they real size? Or for the pony toys?
10if there's a high demand, then DO EET
brushable size
aah
I like doing tiny things :3
10:D
I think I'll get one of the patterns done first, then I can maybe get a picture up on EqD
first is Pinkie, of course
10hahaa
OFC
10do a special edition of RD's 20% cooler battle armor
10XD
Haha, that'd be pretty cool. Not sure I'm that good with sculpting, though
10hm
10there's gotta be some way you can make it :P
10anyway, brb, drink time
we'll see, I'll have a planning meeting with my mom soon :P
10win
lawl
shouldn't be too hard to make several of each dress, big problem is getting the pattern right
10ah i see, so when you've got it planned right, you expect to be able to make a decent amount of them with a fair level of repeatability?
Well, I expect a fair amount of testing to be needed, but after that it shouldn't be too hard to replicate.
10awesome
10I think it's the kind of thing that would probably go down well on EqD
Fluttershy and Rarity's dresses definitely look the hardest to make
10and you might get a decent demand if you get posted there at least :3
lol hopefully not too well, or my studies will suffer :P
haahah

I mean the third movie
...derp
it's literally called Aladdin and the King of Thieves :P
it's title is Aladdin and the King of Thieves
I tought theres was only 1 alladin movie
I'd say a definite B, it's a direct-to-video sequel
You beat me to it, Pinkie
wat
Oh
straight to dvd is bad news
also pochahantas 2
There's Aladdin, The Return of Jafar, and the King of Thieves
still allowed though, I'm guessing
not all direct to video stuff is bad

I just checked, getting the same message.
I'm REALLY worried.
oh, wow, yeah it looks like it's down
'Cause that seems like the host's message.
awww man.
Weird
indeedy
I'm guessing it must be some error, I mean there's been no indication of trouble.
maybe the host pulled the plug?
sup?
O:
suddenly, we talk of alladin and now i get a new I never had about Disney's Princess Frog on dvd on top of chat.
suddenly, ALL ADS ARE FOR DISNEY MOVIES
lolol
I see no ads
For me
sleepy
the mibbit ads
hows you
because I'm a jerk who uses adblock :P
I just right-click-remove item
not too bad today
been working for a guy in the village today
I basically nuke everything I don't want on a page
helped him disassemble a shed, move the pieces, and reassemble it
and then had a go in this flight simulator he's built
same here, though adblock plus takes care of like... 99.9% of that
it is a FF add-on called nuke anything enhanced
I can remove anything from ad to text to a selection on screen
oh cool
that does sound useful
but I'm also lazy, I like to have most of it taken care of. :P
yeps ^^
what 'bout you?
for example I could select all of your lines in chat and delete them from my screen
leaving only my side of the conversation.
Insanely useful for printing
aw, plz don't delete me :(

I had cheated to give myself infinite magic, and when I picked up one of the plot coupons, it tried to fill my magic in an infinite loop, forcing me to turn the cheat off.

Seriously? Aw Bullocks.
mostly giant robot stuff
and Doctor Who/Torchwood viewings
but it is very fun
And live readings too?
close-knit community the Bronystate core is
...Nothing of value was missed. Cept for Doctor who.
Well
And live readings.
To see NewDCD play Super Robot Wars Z2 is quality.
No dramatic live reading of spiderses yet?
Oh god
I hate how much clopfics exist.It's SO unnessecary.
Why is it unnecessary?
As apposed to something else, like bad?
It's bad.So,SO bad.In the bad sense.
Pegacorn, go talk to Silvermane if you don't like clopfics. Or shipping in general.
?
People will write naughty fics for everything. It's pretty easy to avoid. :P
Damn.
lol I read that as "Pony Shipping Contest"
/me calls the RepoMan from "Repo!The Genetic Opera" to rip out clopfic authors' organs without mercy.
Can't touch this.
/me touches this
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
lol
u mad bro?

ah

Oh you don't want me to write Bjornfort into this story, Pegacorn...
10razyn pm me
Dman and I are liek soulbros
hehehe

It's just that the RepoMan is behind you RobotPinkie.
/me yaaaaaaaawns
I am writing this from behind 9001 proxies, there's no way you could find me.
>mfw my english classes on my schedule will step on my Volunteer work at a place where I serve free meals to homeless people
The thing is,the RepoMan killed all your proxies.
;o
but my last proxy is Captain Jack Harkness, and he cannot die.
Jack Harkness?
You don't want to know where I had to plug in my ethernet cable, though....
CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS
The man who cannot die. ever.
also, the shaggy omnisexual
I can never die too.
but can you beat old age?
I'm 128 years old.
There's this one image I'm trying to find
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Jack_Harkness.jpg
Pegacorn, he's over 200 years old
It has Derpy annoying Doctor Whooves by humming the Doctor Who theme
I found it before, but now I can't find it again
I have yet to see a Pony Jack Harkness
Someone should do that
so much Doctor Whooves, yet no Harkness pony
Wonder what his cutie mark would be...
Ok.Harkness is older than me.
(brb,gotta eat)
RobotPinkie: his cutie mark would be whatever represents his omnisexuality.
He can sleep with anything. Men, women, aliens.
and any mix of the three
So maybe his cutiemark is just a picture of his penis?
What are we talking about!?
Not sure that'd make a good pony pic, really....
Captain Jack Harkness as a pony: what would his cutie mark be
http://m.artician.com/pu/FJUNMVC4TOAEKSSRZCEHEH63LBGP2XKZ.preview.png seeing that
Oh damn
lol
seems like it could be a mix of the infinity symbol and maybe the male and female symbols
lolwut?
Jack's mark could be a bunch of 'symbol for female' and 'symbol for male' overlapping with a clock in the circle bit? for 'Time Agent'
That'd work
18 pages
woops wrong chat
well it seems his cutie mark was drawn as a mix of female and male symbols mixed with the sideways 8 that represents infinity
(i'm back)
wait, what pony is that picture supposed to be?
brb
Captain jack
I'm back!
really? because that's awesome
yup
i thought dermathil just said he'd never seen a pony jack harkness?
I'm confused.
google
That pony from earlier is wierd.
lol oh okay
That would be Jack Harkness pony
and I'm afraid to think he looks like drawn G3 style
haha, yeah I guess a bit, still looks really cool
Jack Harkness now wierds me out.
Shower time, if I want to be ready for when I got serve meals to the homeless people.
alright, later Dermathil
Bai Dermathil

I have nothing to say.
Me neither.

Hey, I wonder if someone has written a My Little Primeval: Anomalies are Magic fanfic or something along those lines yet. That would be awesome if done well.
srsly laughing so hard right now
LOL
I'm still waiting for a Dog Police Diamond Dog video.
I doubt it Dermathil.
the best thing about this is the title, btw
I looked it up, dari, and no.
>dad comes home
Hopefully doesn't see this.
HAHA
oh turn it off before he does XD
why am I singing this song to myself now?
nick
because ponies
But with the concept of anomalies from the show, a crossover Humans-in-equestria style could be written and make sense in context
EEYUP
oh yeah
hi all
and hey Luna/HML
I think it is already done
holy shit that was a long as meeting...
WUT
LOL
Really?

Someone needs to make "harder, faster, Scoota"
oh yeah this sing
song*
Dari, think you could put the trailer to Primeval on?
so then...wut on earth are we watching? lol
Sure.
I remember this song when I was in middle school.
if no one else does it, I might throw a shit PMV together for it just so it exists
Trailer for the newer or older series?
Any, but I'd suggest the older series for lack of spoils
I wouldn't mind some Nigel Kneale streaming sometime....
/me yawns awake
The Stone Tape is still fuckin' great.
...though I guess that counts as a movie...
and then everyopny came
stop
lol
dari, enough is enough. I get it. You get the wine and I'll bring the glasses
Do TV plays count as movies on BronyState?
you don't need to keep suggesting it to me
Ahahahahaha
I hear echo

Echo's on the video
ah
Valthejean just gave me an awesome idea.

so many white people
yes, RobotPinkie.
The ONLY criticism from the writer of Doctor Who and Torchwood was the lack of ethnic casting.
DAT BUFFERING
Apart from that, he LOVED the show.
I no longer have the crabs
Oh
Well, then it's still a good show, most likely
quest of the manwhore cannot be understood
you cracked the system, Ziltoid.
>chocolate eyes. eyes are red
....
GGala, low quality
Well, at least he's riding a rainbow
so guys, is raptor jesus your lord?
induring best back up singing
Russell T Davies commented on the show in 2007, criticising Primeval's lack of ethnic casting as "shameful," but then adding "apart from that, I think it's excellent".
Eyup
Celestia is my lord.
ah we're into the second loop
The swf is a loop.
lol so pretty much "You're all racist fucks.... love the show, guise, keep up the good work!"

HAREM ENDING IN MLP VN
the VN is the dating sim?
No.
yes.
Well...
it's the one Bjornfot is programming right?
You know it'd be polite to at least ask first before you advertise. :P
confused there razyn?
inb4 palcomix...oh god why....
Yeah
Bjornfot is the programmer
It's more reading and choosing your options carefull than stat-based dating-sims.
he said there'd be a Silvermane hidden somewhere
yes.
That was for the the VN?
OUR Silvermane will be in the Dating sim.
I want in! Damn...
Doesn't matter though, I'm fine with it anyway, just would have prefered you ask first.
have there been any pictures of it or anything?
im still searching for more people
YES
lol wut
SilverMane
Wut
WUT
Bjornfot told me
WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!
duh
you are streaming it here?
i think it's not just SilverMane iirc...
Visual Novel. It's a pet peeve of mine.
the only person who gets shipped more than Silvermane is Rainbow Dash
may I ask but who is silvermane?
He told me in a pm and he said it during the movie night when I told Silvermane
Silvermane is the king of shipping in Bronystate.
show moar dr who u foal!!!!!111
What Dermathil said.
ah
oh dari
I can't remember the source
He's shipped with everybody everytime.
Our own personal Fernando.
Even things
but I saw an image of Dr. Whooves reinacting the 10th doctor's "exit"
I thought you'd like it
Oooh
/me wishes he could remember where it was from
Do want.
:<
SAME
DOO WANT
lemme see
I think it might have been ponibooru
give me a sec
Dat scene was so emotionally moving I remember
What you mean the video where he talks to Martha?
no the "I don't want to go" part
(not that. I think he means the --yeah. The final tennant scene)
It tore me to pieces.
seeing that the first time
hold on, I will find it for you dari!
@pony Most likely Doctor Whooves assistant

WE've all had that reaction once or twice. To something else, most likely. And maybe without the boner.

Mass Effect 3
not the greatest idea but oh well
Ah.
and now I remember the emotion of that scene...
inb4 Mass Effect 3 story is 2 hours long, and it's mostly just a team based online shooter.
/me feels manly tears just thinking about it.
now that I hath given thee said sacrifice
Is this how the doctor does his thing?
03wasn't on purpose LOL
inb4 he passed out

Did I read the email right, DCD is going to stream stuff like Megas XLR on saturdays?
eeyup
Matt Smith, best Doctor in the history of Doctor Who
Yes, Espy
Awesome.
«LOL
trololololo
yeah, same here dari. When he became smith I just felt like: "WHY?! WHY NOT ANYBODY ELSE BETTER?!"
is there a #BronyState mailing list somewhere?
just email them at the gmail
and ask to be included in the newsletter
12hi drf
Hello everypony~
lol I still like Smith. Yeah he's not Tennant, but who is?
hellow
03sigh
03I just wrote a check for $500
aha
Agent Smith?
03for the mailbox that I hit
cupcakes the movie
liked this one
I heard the main character from the Crank series was gonna be the 11th.
03ordinarily I'd call BS, but the guy actually had a quote on a new one
NO ONE is Tennant
03he had some fiberglass thing >_>
except Tennant
...maybe
RobotPinkie: Eccleston is closer to Tennant than Smith EVER will be.
12x-x
INB4 cupcakes
"Where's Applebloom?"
A female Doctor would have been cool.
hi everyone
YEAH
Instead of...
Eugh.
Smith.
02Hiya
12i know this might not be a good time but i need Microsoft Office
so out of curiosity
I hope next Doctor is female
and gay
and arabic
as I've never actually watched Dr. Who
03LOL
Lawl RobotPinkie.
03do you care what version?
Timelords can become the other gender.
Heck, if I want to be just plain mean, they could've taken anybody from A spider's web
12best deal i can get is only 72 dollars
So...its possible.
is he like...reincarnated, or is it like a whole new person?
ummm
He regenerates.
body is rebuilt
Same guy, new face
more like
Sort of.
He has the same memories.
03it's most likely a bootleg.
12well the books are for 2010 version
12so
just call me zekrom
lol
But he's got a different personality each time.
Slightly different personality though
03hm
but the personality changes to fit the actor
He is the same person, and he isn't, at the same time.
gotcha
I have not seen this before
But still the same dude.
it'd kinda be cool if he was the same character though
12i'd prefer that but otherwords
03well
12i don't think i'm actually required to buy it
would be a testament to all the actors, y'know?
Oh, he remains The Doctor.
03if you don't mind sharing a serial with me
I meant personality wise, sorry
03I can give you mine
12well
implied appleblooom in oven
12i don't see the problem in that
inb4 Smith plays the Doctor until he's 60 years old
Here comes the epic part of the trailer.
03mine's the "Professional Plus" version
OH GOD
03the best one they have XD
ROBOTPINKIE
NO
JUST NO
03since there's no Enterprise one
03I have 2007 Enterprise
DON'T EVEN GO THERE
03my school sells it for $50
Who here read cupcakes before watching Party of One?
U MAD?
12i see
not me
Me.
03If you wanted your own
03I could try to drive all the way down there
03and give them $50
03LOL
"There's an aligator in the tub" = my favorite part
03but eh
me
12nah
03it should work fine
03OK
What was it like?
what's with the keys and stars next to usernames?
12i don't see what bad can happen of sharing a serial
I read cupcakes way after seeing the last episode
03none, XD
go read it
Did it effect the episode any?
no
..Not really.
12i'm pretty sure the class might offer access to word and excel
03So do you want me to upload an .iso file?
12i just need a little thing to tinker with at home
03if you know how to use those
03or if you have blank DVDs

it's the pony equivalent of Half-life fill life consquences.
03They're supposed to allow you to get a certain amount of points before they fail you

With spiders.

ImgBurn I have been using myself
for a free one its nice
Mayhaps angry /Co/mrades have invaded Ponychan?
03yeah
nah
If you mean all the Doctor Who episodes from the first to the last, that's what I'm doing.
03ImgBurn is awesome
it's prolly just a server upgrade
We're at series 2.
Doctor 1 to doctor 11.

Are you insane.
Oh.

oh, I just just being random
I'm really off today

Hawkiiiieeeee
No.There's a meaning to errything.

07Yay XD

ORLY
mfw Heavy rain comes on
seriously, if you tell me how, i'll stream me playing that
03hm, my hotfile premium is good until 2013
(also this is SilverMane)
Heavy Rain is overrated as all hell.
I like the opening song though.
is this actually a video...or are we just going to look at the weird doll the whole time?
it was amazing Pegacorn
Just the song.
nah, there were good parts of heavy rain, but it wasn't a brilliant masterpiece
It's just a movie that you barely interact with!
mib_tlzgh0, y u not named SilverMane?
like, there were some great moments
but yes, overrated a bit
You need to see it more as a movie than a game.
I would say.
also, i like yelling at my friends 'what, you don't want to play make teh dude take a shower?'
Play the japanese opening for transfromers animated for teh coolness
Kind of like Metal gear solid.
03Fileserve, January 2013
07Back!
true Jon. it was interactive cinema is what they called it
Any requests people (not more 30 minute videos Pegacorn :P).
/me chews someone.

MGS is more a game than Heavy Rain is.
03hmm
03if I buy a lifetime Megaupload premium
MGS 4 was half movie
well, honestly heavy rain isn't a game
03I get a 1-month premium voucher to give to someone
03XD
which bothered me
but...meh, I enjoyed it enough
/me chews Aurora's Xmas chocolates if she has any left from then
but they are both amazing

Dman: my lips are locked, and the key is in a box buried under a house I moved into
My dr. Whooves image succeeded!
03LOL
03see

03I'm the type that I absolutely refuse to let anything keep me offline
GGgala_ - Thanks. Don't want nopony .... knowing ... this ... secret ... (can't wait :3)
03unless Verizon up and dies, I have my phone, and I can use it as a modem to get my laptop online

Well, you took it home :P
buh....
03well
Aurora still hates us, maye
wat ez dman's secwet?
How deep
Dman,dari will troll you because of that.
03I COULD, if I wanted to
*maybe
03ever heard of a power inverter?
Valthejean - read above :P
Dman: is your body ready?!
Dman... you know you want to tell me...
Pegacorn - I will take it
Sorta xD
oh lol
03the one I have is only 400W, but if I got a more powerful one I could easily power my computer
Does the car/truck even have enough power to run a PC like yours
GGgala_ been twice, and it's FUCKING AMAZING. (it's a proper, 15 minute back massage and neck massage)
03it plugs into your car's power outlet and makes AC power so you can use household electronics
03yep.
Silvermare read above
Dman,prepare your body,your mind,prepare your ERRYTHING.
03see
Awesome xD
if nopony got it i could say again, I don't mind :P
03all that happens is it eats more gasoline
03XD
03a car can power anything
Nuclear power cars plz?
Pegacorn - sure bro. seeing as the awesome massage will MAKE EVERY FIBRE ORGASM! pretty much
7 23 	Nick 	[142] [229] 381 	"PUTISPUTISPUTISPUTIS!"
03I've seen people run entire office buildings off of a trailer
What exists then.
ORLY
i wasn't here for it
03it all has to do with how DC and AC power works
03XD
Jon - nothing :P
WAT
03you know how wattage is voltage * amps, right?
03well you have a constant 12V.
Bullshit saying ninja.
Before you fuck you must wear protection...
Yeah :P
03so you want more watts, increase the current./
inb4 he says leap
03Increase the current, it gets more dangerous
Silvermare - i'm going to an arabic bath house for 3 hours tomorrow where they give you a PROPER 15 min backandneck massage ... the secret is ... *blush*
I'm ... gonna ...pretend it's ... Flu- :3
03hence it costs more, as they have to use super insulated wires to prevent yo ufrom being accidentally electrocuted
03XD
(pony psychology fanfic)
Basicly Jon,Dman will orgasm while thinking it's Fluttershy massaging him.
This, but not quote
Quite
quite *
I AM HUNTER.I HAVE HEARD ERRYTHING.
Plus the car uses gasoline :P
03haha
03look at this email i got from Nintendo
03"Daniel, do a barrel roll. Star Fox team is back"
Dman... i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear this... that way i can't be jealous
Daniel LOL
Make up your mind
ujelly SilverMare?
03that's my name o.o
As I repeat, it's a proper massage. When you stand up from it, it's hard to keep walking straight. most males (yes i'll ad mit it i do too :P) get at least a semiboner during the massage, it feels that good
I know :p
03but nicknames ftw
Silvermare :3
03Daniel sounds far too formal
But Danny, Daniel, next will be David
03no?
03David is a completely different name LOL
Again, he will get a full blown boner because he will imagine fluttershy massaging him :3
Okay xD
That ninja is BAWS
So aaaaaniway i only said htis cuz i'm going in 5 mins to bed for it
i remember my last good massage
Mike is allways awesome Pegacorn
Pegacorn - play the game! You feel like a ninja baws if you complete it!
it was just like Pony Psychology, although less halucingoens
Solarboy - that's the plan...sorta
It's not Mike BTW.
12Danielle?
At least SF64 3D will be the last of the remakes...we hope
LOL
Silvermare - >implying massage can be improved at all. Seriously it's insane. i'm very very excite.
03remakes are cool though :<
It's not? I always thought Mike was the ninja as well, he is allways the other character
03SMB64 DS was like the best DS game ever
03well, until Mario Kart
i know mine was ruined when my 'masseuse' forgot that i am straight
lol
It's another guy playing the ninja.
ASK A NIN-JA!
ninja looks like he has a skinnier head, yeah

SilverMare,really?
!floof
Stupid B, stop borking x.x
yeah. it resulted in me punching him in the head again
orly
man...this guy really sucks
Silvermare - really? so a guy that massages you thought you were gay
Epic failure.the avgn way.
NUNCHUKFUCK.
Yes, even flippin' ninjas struggle with this game

Dman, no. he knew i was straight, and he had had a crush on me for a while. i don't really remember how on earth he convinced me to let him massage my back to begin with
02well
02It's kinda nice
02since It crashed
02like awesome stuff
That sucks SilverMare.
03>Mandatory updates
welp, with that i'm going everypony! (i know i was barely on, i'm excite, so thought i'd share it :3 may even write story or some stupid thing, i would do that cuz i'm stupid)
03>NOPE.AVI

Hell no.
how about DMC3. i never beat level 8
Fuck you do it.

AHAHAAHAHAHAAHAH
Oh I mean I'm sorry
>is a hardcore DMC player
mfw i didn't really care about it that much
i have a nook, but i don't use it a lot
it's actually a pretty easy game
plus DMC2 was atrocious, so i had little background-love to push me forth sincei never played one
just it has a rediculous learning curve
once you master the combos, the game is pathetic

rage timer?

bubble?
Is actually 'baws'
non

when the raid runs out of time
and the boss kills everyone
Hi! :D
RFED?
>he shoots bees that shoot bullets
Rfed?
haaai
What up?
Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies.
\Bees. My god.
no that wasn't it
not much! you?
it was a term for when the raid took to long, so the boss gets so powerful it's unkillable and wipes the raid
What is this?
Ok SilverMare.
No idea then. Never got into the raids for that game.
Just playing this video and the other that was requested after it.
that's fine
it's an RPG, between 1 and 2 hours long
Only game that I took part in raids for was D&D Online, and those were less fights and more giant puzzles.
relatively funny
I got back from school a few hours ago. My Mac died halfway through Langauge Arts.
I think it was called Enrage Timer
that sucks
lemme look it up

it was Enrage timer
EspyLacopa, i remember a 12 man against the red dragon in the sky.
ANOTHER MOTH
lol
it was ludicrous; we just sent one guy out to fight it, and the rest hid behind a rock
and we spam-healed it
Yup, I remember that. I'm glad that following dragon fights were more interesting, albeit with much younger dragons.
Buffer!
EVIL DOER!
Buffer!
the buffering attack
its the worst one
...
the game is so hard, even videos about it die :P
The WF Titan raid was a bit sad. Only difficulty is surviving until you knock enough pillars onto it, at which point it just gets destroyed ridiculously quick by focused spellcasting.
I'll play the other video while it buffers.

Bullet hell
Wait untill the boss
you unlock it by beating the game without a continue
Oh. That. I had the window up and I bumped into the computer. Sorry about that!
Ikaruga?
and this is still easy.
It's not posible
No Espy, Touhou 06
it gets harder.
link?
Touhou 13 is a big disapointment ):
Hi flandre~
Time to die.
Dari, can I psot the link to download the TOuhou games?
´post*
Sure.
I haven't played 12 yet, the UFO one is done?
UFO is amazing
13 is out now Reticent lol
It came out 2 days ago
what you think dari~
Wait.
Is there a fucking time limit too?
yes/no
I see a counter in the top right corner
for bonuses yes.
Oh thank God.
It's not really a time limit
but its for massive points
If the tiemr runs out that part of the boss dies
there are also spells that need you to run out of time in order to beat them
you get a life every 100.000.000 points
wtf is that...
no it doesn't die
it just loses the bonus
this is touhou I think
the hit box for your character is deceptive, many bullets can cross over your portrait but not land a killing blow, that's the GRAZE count
graze, in this iteration, is a point bonus multiplier
that little red orb you see
I gotta go. Bye!
thats your real hitbox.
that's kind of a stupid mechanic imo
no, its deceptively hard, the bullets have their own unique hitboxes
Byeee
TOuhou 12: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7SDCS5KE
knowing where is safe and where isn't takes TON of practice, or really good eyesight
but my point is that it's needless, just make the images as their hitboxes imply
I was under the impression it was only released as a demo Solarboy, that true?
TOuhou 13? No
Touhou 12? Nope either
oh hey
They both had deo versions
but the full versions are out now
@ValtheJean its a difficulty curve thing, this game doesn't actually SHOW you your hitbox at all
you must figure it out on your own
no
reticet
TOuhou 06 (This one) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5292071
focusing shows your hit box
later games will show it to you, but only when you're 'focused'
yeah, but difficulty in that sense just annoys me
The game was made by a dude
All games show your hitbox when you are focused
it isn't difficulty so much as ignoring the lies the developer tell you
who wanted even harder games then what was on the market
is this the same boss????
same boss still.
Last spell!
I just realized
this dud
is using
NO BOMBS.
/me hugs Altair
lunnnnnnies
hi :3
Kind of cheating though.
And Sneas, wtf?
...How?
Using a patch to see the hitbox.
o_O
no
you can see the hitbox in this one
"Just one question... how did you (or he or she) manage to get the appearance of the hitbox in﻿ this game?"
"@VitoZephyr24 there's a patch.
search on google "Touhou 6﻿ Hitbox Patch"
"
You can allways see the cheatbox
Or can't you?
/me slaps Altair
o_p
You can't.
start ESG
/me gives Kosoveon a bowl of omilk
>|
umm
Otherwise there wouldn't be a patch for it.
:P
My Touhou 06 always had the hitbox
weird.
All the other ones have it though
that one did have it without the patch
Touhou 7: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5303630
he was focused the whole time...
yeah, normally you need to hold shift 'focus' to see it, take the speed penalty for a little satisfaction
'focused'?
dari
Even before the level has started.
can i show you the fighting game of touhou?
Seems pretty cheap to me.
Yeah, when you focus your bullets become stronger, you can see your hitbox and you move slower
/me drinks
'focus' is a mode that decreases your spread, and in some cases your bullet type, and slows your character down, making your movement more precise and easier to avoid bullets
at the cost of massive speed loss.
which you might need.
No speed cost at the start.
Look.
That's pretty fast.
Ah what the hell ): that's cheating
Hitbox still visible.
yeah...hes right.
12nom
yeah
so it does 2 things: increases survivability (because you aren't zipping around) and increased damage (since more bullets are hitting at the same time)
DAT TOUHOU BGM.
Still, amazing that the player managed it.
Seriously, I love the music in this series.
mhm
@Razyn the bgm is downloadable a ton of places if you know where to look, you can just crack the game folder too

Hi

hello again
so who here HAS beaten a Touhou game?
anypony?
I have
brb, work related stuff
ReticentSmolder: >Implying I didn't know that. But thanks anyway.
nice, which one?
6,7,8,10 and 13 on normal
niiiiiiiiice
I still can't beat 12 on normal
i beat 10.5
does that count:D
lol
i got to normal final boss on 6.
I came THIS close to beating 8.
Did you get 12.3 Jon?
By the way, since a lot of people here use mibbit, this is rather important for them to know, dari: http://bit.ly/puSjAO
ummm yes
I've beat 6, 7, and 8 on normal
full patched too.
Basically, big ass security issue happened with mibbit servers
and I've come painfully close to beating 10, I'm working on 11 right now
lol\
/me omnoms Pickle
Sounds like just a problem on the mibbit network.
Not anything to do with us.
I'll read it later anyway.
/me gives Nick a gold-plated GBA
I don't have a registered account, so its no big for me :D
NOOBS EVERYWHERE
I just retype my info each time
Eeyup.
Yeah, but if you use an account with mibbit to automatically identify, that's an issue.
:O

and whut HML
(the problem isn't with mibbit's IRC network, it's with their user info storage servers)

his health was stuck at 1 like...forever
make it a gold plated Gameboy Color and oyu have a deal

he can heal himself

but it was stuck at 1
which implies buddha mode
I thought that's what you guys wanted
More new people
Though tate probably won't return
Yeah
But noobs ;.;
We need them
But they should have two channels
This one, and other channel for the noobs
that sounds badass.
That's ridiculous
But it'll save our minds :P
I am not a Pokemon noob, not hardly
It would also be discrimiating

Not quite so "wut." as other [Random] fics (like Double Rainbow - not the clopfic), but still good.

U BEND BACKWARDS AND SCREEM SUPRISE
and then I remember the cbox stuff

Ohgod
/me explodes
I would seriously lol if this game had a "Sword of Clopping"
I might still have logs of me (Xale) and Fro
durgar annoys me
in the plot items?
kill him
I vaguely remember how TST looked back then XD
I hate mardek
I DONT HATE HIM
XD
OOOOHHHHHHH

the only thing he contributes to the plot is annoying self referencing tutorials!
xd
by the end of Chapter 2, it'll be all "NO I LOVE HIM! WHY!"
I do too
XD
Hallo.

I like how in this pathetically slow battle...you can nulify all damage...
Blue is resistance
Red is weakness
its its resists
JUST HIT IT WITH YOUR SWORD
4XDDD
4someone seems happy im back
if it is 100% blue, immune
50%blue, half damage
red is weak
4the only one aparently
6Well, I'm glad for people to return/join TST in general. :>
it's a game based on elements
4:3
Steelix: I'm not saying I don't want you back :p
and poor story telling :P
I never really knew you in the first
Fire, Air, Earth, Water; also Dark and Light; later on, Aether and Fig
because you got maerdok fucked in the ass
cause mardek is stuned.
when you failed that stun thing
ValtheJean, it's bad because IT IS A BAD FANFIC
wait for after the dragon...
also, mardek is stunned. that is why he isn't going
smite Durrdurrr
From late 2008
Smite is zomg-wtf powerful
03o.o
oh wow yeah wb Steelix
The Dragon is Dark element, so it is typically weak to Light attacks

it's a different way of spelling a different word, perhaps?
I say the less we attribute this game to ponies, the better :P
did i ever tell you how much i love you Dari?
also, Mardek is a Light element, Duegan is an earth element
Yeah
I ran out of ideas too
Durrgan...master of the dearth
Not really an exciting topic

/me pushes Ctr

Basically, Crown copyright states that anything created by the government or a monarch is permanently copyrighted by the Crown (which is a confusing legal entity that basically means "the monarch of England, Scotland and Wales")
03woah

03are quite good

I just thought of something
mod colors of BMN attributed to these asswipes
Haha :P
12drf thinks 2010 is EWWWWW
SILVERSCREEN IS TALKING GUISE
12but i'm sure it'll be more consistent with the books
2010 is a bit odd
I always knew Sathi was evil!
my insides...they hurt too much from laughing
and he doesn't make up words, he just uses pronouns as insults randomly
this guy tries WAY too hard to be Kefka
12o rly
lol
03I'd actually say 2010 > 2007
03because EW THE RIBBON

that was cleverness at its finest!
I doubt it
I bet he uses IE11
:D
Moric the fucking creepy gheist?
Not to sound upset, but is anyone even listening?
Moric Yori (if anyone gets the reference)
umm...yes?
MAN

Oh well then

Don't think about it

You sure we're on the right side?

Has anyone in here done fanfic readings before?
03well
03I'm the only one who gets Cartoon Network HD that can record it.
03since EW SATELLITE
03I just use a CableCard and can dump unencrypted premium cable to my hard drive :)
if you lived out in the middle of nowhere with no cable company, you would rethink that stance
nope
Alright everybrony, cyall tomorrow.
its either satellite TV or NO TV AT ALL
gnight dermathil
03well that's why I don't live in the middle of nowhere
plus satellite is not as bad as you think
03you can't dump streams
03so that's an instant no in my mind
does not matter
03it does when your primary purpose of having cable is recording it...
cya ValtheJean
03my computer is basically a DVR with 10TB of storage
03until satellite companies give you that much..
do almost all TV viewers want to do raw MPEG-2 stream dumps of TV shows?
03I do
03:P
you don't represent all TV viewers
pwned by your child
ohai Drf
i heard you got hacked?
poor grandma
03yes
03my Xbox Live account
wow, you arent the only one that got hacked
did you have any money stolen
03yes
03well
03not actual money
03but all my MS points were spent
:S
wow
03I already called MS about it and they locked my account for investigation
I actually get Boomerang along with Cartoon Network but I already own all of Pokemon's anime I will ever want on DVD
Okay, ran a test recording
so no need to dump anything
03I've actually recorded a few movies from Starz HD that do not exist on Blu-Ray or any other HD source
03one being Pokémon 4Ever, and it's not an upscale.
plus you can't do direct stream dumps from AT&T U-Verse
03well it's KINDA an upscale, LOL, but it's better than any DVD master
03EW U-VERSE
03See
I don't care
03I was talking to AT&T about that as my mom actually considered switching
03the lady flat out told us
it works for me
03when you watch TV, it slows your Internet down
03that = DO NOT WANT
huh
was that the pilot episode?
oh was it just a random one?
12lol
I find that annoying
12speed freak
12he probably goes 30 over the speed limit
gotcha
03more like 50
03I mean
03hi
either way, that was pretty good
12hi
especially since I was downloading a Linux ISO image while a few others were watching TV
coming in with absolutely no expectations
my download speeds went through the floor
03yeah
well written, good camerawork
03that's the main reason I hate U-Verse, recording asidde
03-d
and the characters are actually interesting
03I still think digital cable is the easiest thing to use
03no dishes to deal with
unlike certain things....
not to mention the quality is crap when you are downloading a big file
03no internet speeds dying
03etc
03My cable company finally got rid of its analog cable
cough gurrdarr cough
03but
03they give you free converter boxes if you have CRTs and dont'care about digital cable. :)
03So we still only pay for one cable box and have like 4 TVs with cable.
oh don't pretend
that game you spent like, 3 hours playing
lol its like wow, we thought sony was bad, but microsoft is just as bad /laterandomresponsetoXBLhacks
it was a good game, wasn't it Prince
you loved it
03not really
an HD version of Pokemon 4Ever I can understand
or right
because I can't find a DVD release
I got the d and the g mixed
03because at least Microsoft is looking into the problem :P
03o_O what?

I have about $600 coming to me soon in the form of a loan so I am looking on Craigslist for a motor scooter

I just enjoy my privacy :P
lol, what is it Dari?
I'm in 21-21+x
21s a good age
right when you think you're free from everything
but too young to see your dreams crushed :P
:p
Haha
Such optimism
comes with the territory ;)
correct me if I'm wrong, but hipster turned 21 last wednesday, right?
yup. sucks.
Oh that explains the drunken ponychan posting
gambel too
All I remember was his "I'm gona go get smashed!" thread
eh, it makes sense given the history
in Europe, alcohol was much more prevalent in common society
literally, European history grew up with it
we started with a bunch of religious crazies
Hurray for prohibition!
and even at one point banned it altogether
What sucks is it's also the age when you get your permnate drivers lic inste4ad of just the pemit
so it makes sense we have a checkered relationship with drinking
Hurray for Canadian alcohol smugglers!
lol
If it was for rum runners we would never have nasscar.
phff, it's the ONLY good mix with alcohol :P
http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6325071/ this WILL creep you out.
Not sure the drinking here helps anything....
Wait, you mean rum runners are the reason we have nascar?
What is the UK's stance on guns
yep
Dammit!
but if I didn't have my gun, I couldn't shoot at those dern kids on mah lawn!
after they stoped running rum they still loved the raceing
NO GUNZ FOR YOU
any thing full auto is illigal unless you have it grandfathered
Ah, gotcha. I seem to recall hearding something along those lines before.
as in you had the gun before the law was made
well
o-o
only Torchwood can carry guns
One of the lines paraphrased in 90% of non-grimdark ponyfics: "There are things in this world that neither science or magic can explain, and Pinkie Pie is most of them."
that's like saying prostitution is illegal in Vegas
err sorry, legal
Freeze I thought you were sleeping XD
squeak.
netsplits
it's illegal in clark county proper but 30 min out we have the bunny ranch.
Pinkie Pie is like Deadpool. She understands she is in a cartoon and uses that knowledge to speak to the animators. She's very persuasive which is why she's allowed to break all the rules.
so then
how bout dem ponies?
She has what they would call Genre Savy
Naw, Pinkie Pie is just best pony, that's why she's allowed to do whatever she likes.
Pinkie Pie is not best pony. I'm pretty sure we've already covered this.
yup
I concure RD is best
Rainbow Dash? That's a weird way to spell Caramel
lol
We have covered this, and we discovered that Pinkie Pie was objectively best pony.
Nope. Word of God says Rainbow Dash is best pony.
FOREVER!

I have no clue who Caramel is, though.
/me dies
he's only the best pony

Caramel is the irresponsible pony that always loses the seeds during winter wrap up.

I will always remember this day as the day that ValtheJean was horribly, horribly wrong about best pony.
and then cut through your chest
02More arts of your dragon or arts in general?
and pull out your lungs
and choke you with them
ok was gonna say I think that's a cadny bar over here

hmmm look at that fic.... don't you just want to.... read it- Dari
XD
lol
..... there is a wiki for shiping?!
Best pony is all 6 ponies?
there are no words
to describe the horrors I wish to inflict on you
Applejack is clearly not top tier.
ah ok was gonna say. I cant realy make out the page on the stream.
even Wikipedia says Big Mac x Caramel is canon?
eeyup
IT IS NOT FUCKING CANON YOU GOD DAMN COLT CUDDLER

Derpy is awsome cause she was shaped by the fandom
Well yeah, but Derpy has more of a history than the rest.
The more I think about it, the less I like Fluttershy. :/
All the BG ponies are pretty cool to me.
I don't realy have a favorite.
BG seems more like playing spot the car.
02I probably have, but I don't remember lol
If Derpy was just a regular BG pony with normal eyes, would you like her so much?
that is what makes the character -_-
o.o
seen this yet?
man blue text on black bg is like imposable to read.
It really is.
I wish Derpy would deliver me muffins...
Love that look RD has there at the end.
Do wonder if derpy will ever have a line.
DJ for us
Maybe a shot of her delivering mail or something?
and yeah.
I kind of like the voice there but yeah sure some will rage if it's not how they pictured it.
play musecs
Clyde is best pony.
04I join and EVERYONE DIES
lmao
This is now canon
side not that guy made alot of those buttons.
er note*
Vinyl Scratch for best pony.
pay no mind to my random thought tangents.
Hey Dari

Oh that's right, it's still winter in Oz.
so whats going on in there?

Oz?
i is in bathurst and it goes to -8'c in the center of town and to '16 in oberon, a little village about 30 miles away :)

That's quite a range.
well, how about where is you?
Eh, I'm in Sweden, so it's obnoxiously hot
sorr -16'c
*sorry
lol oh okay, that makes more sense
geez the f774ken typo faries have set up shop on my keyboard!
I'm in Canada.Quebec to be exact.It's sorta neutral in hot/cold right now.
quebec
Well in the far north of Sweden it's probably a lot cooler... We're a tall country.
very nice
never been to Canada or Australia, but I want to visit both.
i chat to a friend in montrel quiet regulaly
Quebec is quite close to Montreal.
wow you is in sweeden robo?
Though TBH my highest priorities are probably UK and India. :P
Yeah. It's a pretty nice country, this. :P
hey Anth
relatively low brony population, unfortunately
heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllo
well do you get to see many trains robo?
=D
OOOOOOH NO!THIS IS SAD DAY!
not really, no, which is unfortunate.
bugger
I go to Uppsala about once a month, so that's one train I see.
i want to know if the dm3 still operates in sweeden
dm3?
To my knowledge,i'm pretty much the only brony in Quebec.
it is a freaking monster of a loco it hauls the iron ore trains and has 3 sets od side rod driven wheels like a steam engine...
seen something like that?
Ohai
Pegacorn: , the floow i chat to is a furry..is that close enough :)
oh yeah, looking it up on google images
*fellow
I definitely have seen those, but not in a very long time
bugger
Furry?I wonder if my flamethrower would help in this situation.
they are the most powerfull locos ever built anywhere
well like I said, I don't see many trains :P
They could still be operating out in the country
I just don't go there much, lolz
they can start and haul a 5500ton train on a 1 in 40 grade in -40'c inside the arctic circle. nothing else comes close!.
Pegacorn: , well im not sure if flame throwers work on furries...but still...
But i thought that the first target of flamethrowers were furries!
^^
I dunno about that

Sorry,i decline.

Y?
*sigh I'm sick of trying to sort my mam's laptop out
frigging thing keeps having something updating, fixing, solving, installing
I just don't feel like it.I think i'd get looked at wierd if any of my friends IRL would know about it.
c ya Dman
well that's what sneaking off and excuses are for, Pegacorn
They once looked at me wierd when i played MLP FiM:Adventures in Ponyville on one of the school computers.
They were playing Minecraft while i was doing that.
I think I'm a sucker for Gilda redemption stories
I guess... it makes sense, Pegacron. But Even then I am so making a group at my Cegep. However obscure it may be, I'll have to find bronies in my area that way.
I'd really love to start a meet up group, but I'd feel extremely creepy if only 16-18 year olds showed up.
hahaha
Here's hoping you succeed.
I need to find out if there's a meetup near me any time soon.
yeah good luck, Dermathil
hell no
Don't tell me to make one, though. I'm horribly disorganized
/me gives approval to Dermathil.
>yfw only 3-6 year old girls show up with their parents
olololol
That would suck.
lolol I don't think that's even possible, though

I could always edit the eyes on an above picture to make them look at the screen.
epic episode
Dari - i could do that myself, but it's the resolution, man. too low. D:
K-9 being epic.
Seriously dari,can you play my request after this?
Maybe.
We are in a car.
/me is bored

Oh Snap! proper argument against doctor :P
Doctor Who. The Lonely Angel.
"Everything has its time, and everything ends"
That sounds familiar.
From later on or something.
Probably

LOL MICKEY
tes
XD
*yes
now, errypony, background.
some sorta indoor one :P
LOOK FOR A BACKGROUND!
Dman, just use the same background for epic scene
K-9 is BAWS.
dermathil - need standalone background
so it stays still, but pony zooms in
ah
And title it "Rainbow Dash pays a surprise visit"
as in gets closer :P
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO K-9!
;____;
;__;
K-9!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lol, Giles' last words.
YOU BAD DOG!
Affirmative
affirmative!
KENNY KENNY KENNY!
KENNY BLEW OUT THE SCHOOL
omagad! the school was kileld by kenny!
Poor K-9
whatabastard
Dman, I agree. Use the same background.
Rodman - need standalone background
so pic can zoom but background reamin
back again
trying to get web off a ladybird now Dx
Wait a minute, doesn't K-9 appear later in the show?
/me glompths angel
/me is glomped :3
you're speaking as if the robot dog died
K-9 does come back.
But I'm just keeping the mood.
Rainbow zooming in wouldn't reveal the hole cropping her would cause, seeing as it fits in the first place
:P
@Rodman:Rainbow Dash pays a surprise visit to who?
Ok guys i'm gonna vector dis and take out the background
I dunno, Dari?
srsly rodman or someone like robotpinkie :P find background pic that's good and has nopony
Dman, then take the same picture again
You don't need another background.
Ok, I'm gonna go look
...unless the pic with door is fine
That's kind of hard to find
You can just crop out Rainbow.
yea i realinse now
We must make a list of beings that Rainbow Dash would pay a surprise visit to!
if RD only zooms pic is fine
gotcha
OK BROS TIME TA WORK!
TIEM FO WORK!

Dat guy's face.
XD
dat servant be TRIPPING BALLS
13I'm curious, are nickalerts useful?
suddenly, ponies
The first rule is. There are no rules.
13I do a lot of idling, so if by chance someone needed me for something I sometimes wouldn't know about it until it's too late |D
hi L[a]korv and Nick
I'll give ya the link to my Youtube account, just link to it. Or credit will do
13and hai Kosoveon~~
The first rule of ponies.... You talk about ponies.
13Alright then :3 It's just that I've heard some people talk about how nickalerts can be annoying or something
they can be, especially if you have a name/word/phrase that people use a lot |D
guys
The vid. once RD's face zooms in to full screen, it's a little pixely : /
13Well, Angel could be an exception
13but other than that
how pixely is "a little"?
otherwise.. not really.
I'm guessing it's probably fine, unless you want to vectorize the whole thing
Would do, but don't know how. never vectored anything bfore
well, it's not TOO pixely, but vector would be good if anypony knows how
/ knows a tutorial for me
you can do it semi-automatically
oh?
06and well, I'll be back later n.n
/me hugs AE~
Future technology always seems to be so poorly thought-out. Pfft, safety overrides, what are those?
as long as it's a pretty good picture, anyway
how
it's all 'kill everyone to accomplish the objective!'
Inkscape can auto-trace, I'm sure other vector programs can, too
Inkscape?
you just need to erase the background after.... which can be a pain
it good? worth using?
It's free, only vector drawing program I've ever used, lolz
How did she know he's called Doctor?
>Sees The Docor's mind
Works both ways
I could try to do it, but I might fail horribly :P
apparently
Besides, he told her what he's called when she was a child.
Robotpinkie it's worth a try. want a pic of how pixely it is at full face?
okay
Dat Title Drop
darnit.
13Oh wow I forgot about this game http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm
She saw the dancing scene
13It's so cute and addicting
13D:
and after that you can just link me to the isolated Dash, and I can try to do a vector...
he's BEEN gone for FLIPPIN' hours that's where he IS.
gramer
Stay brit, mickey, I love you for it :P
lolol

Hmm
well, link to pic whenever you feel like, Dman. can't promise anything, but I'll try
robotpinkie for the mo i'll (not to youtube yet) make vid with pixely face and post like in mediafrie
then dari can show us all
oh ok i can do so now
oh okay, you can do that first.
okie
Here comes my late wise answer
some clients have really annoying nickalerts
some haven't
Now look back at the Doctor.... The Doctor is now an angel
;__; this scene is emotional
This episode is sad.

VIDEO IS RENDERING EVERYPONY
Yay!
YEEEEEEEEES!
...15 mins to render 4 min vid? ;___; ok
Did you make it a 2px zoom per second?
(DAT FACE)
Dari - ... well, it zooms in pretty slowly
It's something like that I think.
4 min vid
dari, it's like the vid, but a little pixelyer, ONLY a little thou :P
also, final 5 seconds xD
Emphasis on the wrong word. :P
I do believe Karren is defeating them in logic
Granted, ridiculous logic, but still
also sorry doesn't zoom in as much
Awwww
i could do another one where zooms in as far as Tw i does, if someone showed me how to vector image / someone vectors image
Rodman want to vector / teach me to vector? :P
I guess think of this as like a v0.1?
V.01 it is
I'll shut up
Dman, is the last 5 seconds having RD lowering slowly?
...Dermathil that's one helluva good diae
remembar ideas for second version :P
but no it isn't
It's actually not that funny, just something silly, that WON'T be in later vids probably cuz it sorta ruins it, cuz it's funny and not seductuv
e
BUT EH, v2 when i can vector that rbd pic
I MIGHT do so tonite, would take AAAAges thou
will need motivation :P
41% rendered
LOL
(yea i guess tonite i'll make a 2nd version after vectoring rbd picture, so zoom goes to eyes
"Spread the pilot to death"
10lmao

oh god what happen?
I feel like a terrible person
I just educated a 14 year old on who John Wayne Gacy was
Oh lawl!
Don't know who that is.
I am 12 and what is cannibalism?
Dari: He was possibly the most sadistic mother fucking creepo sadist known to man
rainbrodash - kinda hard to do that vid - colgate got no body or antyhing
It is the act of eating another member of the same species!
murdered over 20 different people
pretended to be a clown
so he could molest young boys
10yeah dman don't worry, its cool
pretty much the most disgusting piece of filth in existence
10not really fussed
k then ... : (
will work on v0.2 of RD one xP
10tbh, I didn't know what name either ValtheJean... :3
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy if you're interested
but frankly, I wouldn't
just because knowing people like that existed is perturbing

why would RBD not worry because of cameras in his shower?
Yay.
