12because you were expecting it?
12I never cry when watching movies
12see

/me runs
12my problem was

12if you've ever seen Vampires Suck
12the Becca's sleep-crying is comparable
Haha
:P
03NightSeas
03I agree, but that movie makes fun of the
03*them
03:P
katniss didn't cry that much in the book
Baby Cathiss
;>
12oh
the whole point was that she wasn't going to lose composure
6she totally lost it
12I must watch that movie then :D
6but they didn't let the audience grow to connect with rue
6like, they barely did
6most people cried cuz they knew her from the book
03I should just burst out laughing at the end when I see it tomorrow

12gets*
12XD
I am back

bouncer ?
12hurr
yeah

03real pros just keep their computers on 24/7
I mean

/me runs
12well in that case, when I get back XD
I don't
I have limited bw
Butbut
I say away in my name
;<
^
that works
03I still don't see the point LOL
12anyhow, night
clears up the confusion
:<
03well you're special
04use bouncers when you need logs
03but for people like me, bouncers would be completely pointless
6uh
6why
if that desktop can stay on without getting overheated I'll do IRC on that
6am I still awake
6ffff
03Sato it shouldn't overheat
how was the hunger games movie lol
even with 8?
6drake
6that sentence made no sense
6at all lol
I plan on dual booting
04YOUR FACE MAKES NO SENSE
04I know
04it's embarrassing
/me shrugs
6koso, it was pretty...um.
6dunno if you read my critique of it on forums
6I basically hated it
you want clones? I'll give you 1200 of them
I hadn't checked the-
actually USPS then drf
oh
:/
6so much potential, lost due to poor cinematography choices
6not even related to the story
04shut up we don't need another drf
6and I don't hate everything
/me runs
03yeah but you should
/me hides
6I actually have open mind on most everything
6hell no lol
03We need more drf's
04no
04we don't
04at all
04ever
04again
04forever
04infinitum
03>:(
04eternum
drf, d'you want spambots?
03no?
I can get them to PM you too ^_^
03unless you can...yea
03OK
03spam #PM
6koso
03oh
03I misread that
I am the one.
03but spambots on #PM
03is fine
6the director decided that camera shake for effect was necessary for every single scene
nah
03also make them all @find and !list
/me runs
OH
6only like 4 scenes in 2 hours had still camera
03LOL shaky camera
in that case yeah that's dumb
6and the camera shake was HORRIBLE.
03Star Trek has that problem
>_<
03but it's a good movie
6nononono I was really impressed with the sets
04no drf
Star Trek 2 is coming though right?
I HATE movies that do that.
03it basically comes down to
03EVERYONE'S A CRITIC
/me runs
03both of those
03but I still loved it
it's coming 2013
03I care more about story than anything LOL
04same
I remember watching Cloverfield when it first came out
and hating it
03honestly, the trailer for that movie
03OK well
03Cloverfield
for exactly that reason
03is a retarded movie
04Unless the camera is HORRIBLY DODGY I care more about the story
03it's basically "monster attacks people"
04Iron Sky looks frikkin' hilarious
03that's like a 10-second story
03>_>
aside from the fact that the story was dumb etc.
the camera
made me physically sick
03Ascendant it probably hates you too
03I disagree
^
03um
03I have no idea?
I've played kid icarus
for like
11 hours
and I actually really enjoy it
the controls don't really bother me at all
6lol
The Avengers (2012) looks good
the only thing that bother me is the camera
03when she saw the preview
because you control it by flicking the bottom screen with the stylus
03o.o
and whoever thought of that should be fired
6wuh
03>Nintendo
but other than that
just hope they balance the characters well
it's pretty good
03but then at some point they're forced to agree
03:D
:D
:?
03they're just nowhere near as good as they were in the 80s LOL
03and 90s
!ew Playstation Vita
02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW PLAYSTATION VITA
03hey, at least the Vita has been hacked
drf's logic
if it can't be hacked, it's horrible
but yeah I recommend it
03well
03unless it actually allows open development without needing to be hacked
03a la Android
03EW AUTOMATIC UPDATES
less power to the player
lol
03Nintendo's updates are like
03"Let's call it a 'security fix' and then remove all their mods :D"
03They've done it several times now >_>
are you supposed to have those mods?
03very carefully®
lol trademark
03same with just works®
03they're expressions I stole from people :P
03anyway
hmm
/me runs
03you mean ©?
/me hides
they're plugging holes that hackers can't find even
03ó.Ô
!ew d®f
02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW D®F
03erm
03ó.ô
drf is a registered trademark of the cynical people of the world foundation
03the Xbox 360 has probably the biggest hacking community of all systems hence why people keep exploiting it after the updates
still no softmod
03and second biggest are probably the iPhone/Android people
03who do jailbreak/root hacks
still hoping though
03Sato, it's impossible to softmod
ìsëé
03it's never going to happen.
the moment the exploit is found
don't you think the same was thought of Wii drf?
that we couldn't softmod it
6well
Took 2 years with the Wii
:<
good night rawra
:>
hmm
touche
03but anywa
03y
you don't leave when the topic comes up though
6.
6koso
03the Wii was supposed to but didn't in all cases
6before I go
6whats the weather
03so someone found an instance where you didn't need a signed program
I have her on ignore
6lol
03and that's how the hacks were formed
!w 54650
Onalaska, WI: Partly Cloudy and 54°F(12°C)
6good
Fail.
it was rathhhher
not hot but warmish
6lol
03the Xbox 360 actually reports if you're running unsigned code though
!w 95023
6it's raining
6so beautiful
!w Anaheim
Anaheim, CA: Scattered Clouds and 57°F(14°C)
6and 47
03but how many people use their Xboxes offline?
03that defeats the purpose LOL
03honestly the whole fun of the Xbox 360 is Xbox LIVE :P
I'll play on the J-Tag servers
03jtag requires hardmod dudce
03*dude
I'll play on the non-existent I'm screwed servers
03@*NAND
nice
03it'll have a switch on it
03to switch between JTAG and non-JTAG
03so you can run homebrew and then just switch it back to normal to play online
it was like
03best of both worlds
raining
*hard*
03but you're missing the poijnt
03-j
03you wouldn't go online with the JTAG NAND
03:P
03then when you do go online you switch it to the normal one
never play online with JTAG NAND
I see
03exactly
03you can use flashed DVD drives though
6anyways
night
not that I can see you
6haha
6so much for having me on ignore
but still just got to be polite all the same
/me runs
:3
6ha.
6polite is hardly the term
6ugh
6alright
is she talking to me at all? anybody?
!touhou

I have infracted on no single rule
6yes attacks, when I've asked you to stop, and then you turn around and do this: http://mibpaste.com/v15XLY
if a person asks you to stop
there should not have to be a rule
to make you stop.
it's called respect
07that works
04You should be.
04/bond one liner
I banned him just then

I showed the first one to him
Second one I didn't bother since it's common sense
As for logs

03we're seeing it in IMAX
As such.
03so I sure hope I don't :P
6thats been a problem with this movie cuz of the crazy camera shaking
disconnect or something
6lol
12They did as kind of a censor
03movie's at 6:45 I think
03Aurora, all weekend
12that as*
6I still hate that all the twitard fangirls migrated to hunger games
03LOL
6so the /normal/ fans are now surrounded by them.
03because they tend to follow anything that's popular
03:P
6yeh
03I mean
03and that was just a regular theater, not anything special
12when usig mibbit using mibbit I just open another tab for more servers
6midnight showing for my theater
12-usig
6we bought tickets when they decided to make two showings instead of one
Another browser tab
?
6we get there that night, there are 8 separate lines
12yep
6EIGHT SHOWINGS.
03LOL
03wow
Baka, etc.
03see, that wouldn't work at this theater
wtf
lol
03as there's only one IMAX
oh ok
6that was ridiculous lol
You can have multiple server connections in a single mibbit instance.
03it's prolly sold out already
12when using mibbit*
12asd
03but wow
03my friend was telling me
03is it really that violent? LOL
03I mean, I know the concept of kids fighting each other is
03but somehow THG struck me as a kids' series
is that good?
6drf yeh
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2a8EEQdNFM
6it was severely cut down
arti and rn got to ask first lol
6the book has some pretty gruesome deaths
6after all, they are kids killing each other
6uh
6wait
6what part was that
03when they were all fighting
03Nickario

03Nice
03So envious :P
03I recognized her voice LOL

/me runs
12I actually don’t remember that
03it's when uh
12then again, I only watched it once
lol I thought I sounded stuttery I was nervous xD
03I'm trying to remember, it was such a long movie
03fighting people
03and someone chops his head off with their sword
03the camera cuts away a little but you can still see it
12XD
12I must have went to the bathroom or something during that part
03LOL spam email

"We want more DLC"
04[07:57] <HyperMetalLugia> "We want more DLC" <- Now THAT is something you don't hear. Ever.
04Most often people COMPLAIN about DLC
Lol
03I like DLC
03as long as it's not "evil"
03as in
03opposed to just unlocking something on the disc
03but levels like The Sacrifice for L4D(2)? Sure
14I'm with drf :3
04I agree drf
14they should have done just one Guitar Hero with like 10000 DLC of songs xD
04but then you'd hate the "From Ashes" on ME3. Files were already on the disk :<
14or just one Fifa with yearly DLCs
14or Madden, PES etc

14ok, I need some help
10lolwut
14let's say I'm connected to three servers on mIRC, ok?
/me runs
some show called Apt. 23
14I have "Apple" as nick in the first one, "Pear" in the second and "Potato" in the third
14how do I preserve them in case I disconnect?
uh
I can help later
14:D
when you connect, /server -m server.irc.com -i nick altnick
for each network
that way the nicks are preserved
the -i switch sets the nicks
14o.o
14thank you :D
/me celebrates
My BOPM got around 10 of them, I banned him a few seconds after he connected for an IP that didn't hit the DNSBLs, and then banned the user info he used to connect with
Yes Nick
10Ascendant
/me parties with angel
i'm still in contact with him
10When he evaded, did he use the same nick or a different one?
if any of you need/want to talk
he used the same nick, switched once
which is how I figured out it was him
10Wow.
I ended up banning the second nick
and he was like "how did you figure out it was me?"
10Did he say anything when evading?
10in main chan, that is
14uhm
he used Goomba and FearLaRoxas
14how old is he again?
14o.o
he didn't get time to
10k
my BOPM got him whenever he connected
I didn't see any of that
and the one or two times he got past it I glined him a few seconds after he got in here
you weren't on

Satoru is my friend Sky from another site
10Aero, Koso just told me
10I apologize.
alright, sorry
also this theater is only like half full

I might actually join the forum

Anyone wanna help me with trig homework?
XP
no thanks lol, that hurts my brain
XD
I'm sure youd get some competition
solving trig equations, polar equations, proofs?
/me is officially lost
off to work on govt homeworks
lolk
um
here's the problem
yeah it would
Itd be no fun if i always beat everybody :
:ap
:p
Good lord i have 31 skylanders total jow
Now
Plus 9 extra things
well, you'd have to do cos^-1(3/5) to find the angle, although there are actually two possible angles
I am. How come?
wait
anyway
find arc cosine of 3/5?
/me hugs back
yes
but it's - 3/5
that's what's confusing me owo
I believe that means the angle is negative
o.o
for example
angles can be negative?
yeah
-30 is the same as 330
oh
omg this is why I got a C+ in Geometry sophmore year
math dislikes me strongly
well see Koso
make a triangle and write the numbers on the sides
like
one angle would be A
that works too
I'd do adj/hyp
hyp
not opposite
silly kos
oh, right
;P
that would be tangent
anyway yeah
no, that'd be cotangent ;p
I think
oh
because tangent is opp/adj
;3
nonono
yeah
cotanj is um
well cosecant is 1/sin
Mainly because the things I want to buy are never in stock
1/sin / 1/cos?
DRIFTING FROM THE POINT ;-;
Yeah. I see hehe

that one trainer in brock's gym never learned
inb4 that gym trainer i
KOS
D:
03Nintendo is stupid
stealing my inb4's
03but usually it's used for like, how far away planets are
03which is a distance
atto is the SI prefix for ^-18
03er stars, not planets
=1 light year
I believe
03Google knows the answer to that one
/me runs
oh you mean a 1 w/ 100 0's behind it?
03no
03that's googol
lol ok
I wrote a googol once
it was fun
I dare you to write a googolplex
yes Kos?
:3
03You could easily do it in MS Word
wait
03just copy and paste it
03:P
no I wrote it out
on paper
03File, print?
/me hides
"a," not "the word"
googleplex is 10 googols right?
03no
100^100
10^10^100
excuse me?
D:
it'd take you wayyyy longer than that to actually physically write it LOL
you guys are mean :<
no
dude,
03OK I was going to make a comment
03but you'd take it the wrong way
03>_>
there are much less atoms in the universe than googolplex
no
googleplex is finite
oh shush
03you fill one page with 0's
03then find a copy machine
03and duplicate it a bunch of times
03Problem?
but that's pricy
D:
03it's free
03o.o
03even at my high school
03I'd just walk up and do it for free
03because I'm that aweosme
03:P
20 cents a copy
it's annoying
03fine, mail me the paper and I'll do it for you

I'm half joking
03though you do make me want to cry in a corner sometimes
03:P
03why a corner? I dunno, it's an expression
Kos, Danny's making me have low self essteem
03<junh1024-XD> drf, why aren;t you willing to burn mythbusters & kids TS to BD? <- because that takes actual effort
03I already have them half burned
03and then I just kinda s4topped

03I got through school just fine LOL
03never actually read To Kill a Mockingbird, even though we were supposed to
OMG
YOU ARE MISSING OUT
THAT BOOK IS AMAZING
like, the only thing I ever sparknoted that I didn't read entirely on my own
was Grapes of Wrath
NO IT'S INTENSE

I'm currently trying to figure out why the frick my phone won't send texts
I didn't disable anything related to texts
like it just sits there spinning the stupid progress thing and the messages never actually go through
again
Did you remove STK?
STK?
um
no
I just used autostarts to disable most of the bloatware
Might not exist on CDMA phones
but that shouldn't affect *sending* texts
and even then, everything is enabled on SMS receive except Remote Web Desktop o.o
Thats on receiving not sending
I just said that
nothing happened
and where it usualyl turns into a "message sent" symbol, it's just spinning OSX_style
Reboot
I already did
I'm not that daft LOL
ANDROID IS A STOLEN PRODUCT! :D
No comment
O. O omg
win 7 is very fast
no, but I'm sure it's not a Verizon problem
Yes it is.

maybe take the simcard out and put it back in?
Sure, why not
installing drivers
power off first? :P

03we're boys, we aren't supposed to see colors well
/me runs
;D
03no but anyway
03you know what's weird?
03It includes a crap-ton of bonus content, and after the OS is installed it starts flashing a commandline and tells you not to remove the disc LOL
here
http://img87.exs.cx/img87/1228/dutchdellmce1bg.jpg
THIS
:P
03oh
03mine includes media rollup 2
in english n' all
same
but MCE is cool, right?
03it's decent
03I mean I'm just running it in a VM
03uh
03it's a *DVD*
03It has like 2GB of extras
03LOL
03mostly videos and crap
03but oddly enough
03they're DRM-protected videos, but yet the system was never individualized for DRM o.o
03it's magic®
is that a good thing(tm)
03well
03though I do get legit MCE keys through TechNet if you need ISOs/serials XD
03http://www.ebay.com/itm/190654746553?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649
03exact item I bought
okay
yeah
same disks as I got
I have my old soundblaster disk too xD
03*rollup
03so uh, there's only two service packs for MCE?
nono
My XPS/MCEXP is on SP3
I had to update it to SP3 though
hrm
03well yeah
03supposedly media rollup 2 is the newest version of MCE hence why I asked
Newest OEM
:P
Disk version but yeah
03newest version they made
03as in
03they never bundled it with SP3
03unlike regular XP
03but that's because MCE kinda died
MCE is fun
03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/video-game-memes-but-i-loved-the-red-light.jpg
03What DOES that button do?M
03-M
oh
I know
for PS1, switches between the dpad and sticks
my logitech controller has it too
03the games couldn't just use both?
Most older PS1 games didn't have or use the stick
sucked really badly
03yeah
03as in, SNES ripoff
03:P
ahem
SNES CD much?
:P
03SNES CD?
http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/27664/4/2.jpg < Whatever was made/suppose to fill this hole *giggle*
Think Sega CD, but Sony+Nintendo
they pretty much exchanged ideas for the SNES' addons
Nothing ever happened though
03Nintendo used Splash! But nothing happened!
03that sold me that MCE disc
MCP?
:p
03HyperFocusPro
03same first word :P
:O
nice
03since you aren't allowed to sell OEM software without hardware
03it's retarded LOL
03see, this pisses me off
03What if it can't?
03then you have to resort to piracy :P
LOL
03because it's whining that I haven't activated it
03activation.
oh
03and it doesn't like VMs
03:P
03luckily I have an XP activation crakc
03*crack
could use that for my VM if I ever make one
03XD
Okay
:o
03Yay pirating PS2 games
Well
There was no point as
> No hacked PS2
> No DVDs
but you see
03installing SP3 on this MCE
that was like 3 years ago
yes you can
03yes
03t0hat's the whole point
03if it's 2GB, you're already maxed out on one
i have 3GB of Ram but only 2.6 is available. i think
32bit
03no

03for like $5
03anyway
03no
03I mean
03to write the disk
Gotcha
03the computer I'm installing it on has one built in
03but that's now two floppy disks th1at have sector errors
03LOL
Lawl
03the other wrote 100% but the XP setup was like "error reaidng file"
03*reading
Old arse dicks
03I guess I'll go find more
03yeah
03and I'm going to assume tha twas a typo :P
03inb4 no it wans't
03*wasn't
03god dang it I need to stop typoing
Oh bugger
That one was a typo
:P
03:P
The problem is that 3.5 floppys aint floppy
03they are if you take them apart
now the 5inch ones, they are floppy as helll
Sure
But the 5inchers flopped around like no ones buissness
03XD
03yeah
03I destroyd a couple of those
03what sucks though
03is I just got this combo drive
:D
03that reads/writes both 5" and 3.5" floppies
Sorry
03and I don't have a single 5" one to try it out with anymore
03since I threw all of ours out LOL
03I know
I mean
03:P
XP drivers discs!
03everybody and their brother used floppy disks for everything
03but those are such crappy formats
CD-RW's sucked
03like those discs don't last 20 years
03XD
03I know right
03DirectCD
DVD-RW's also sucked
03a
03some retarded proprietary crap
03where you could lioke
03*like
03write a single CD-R more than once
03it was multisession crap
03required special software to read/write
03actually
Ooohh
03XP had it built in for writing
03it asked you
03if you wanted to do DirectCD or normal
03*dunno
Weird
Burning CD's of junk
Losing CD's
Burning more
Then losing it again
03OK WTF?
03something about line 1747
Maybe the file you made is b0rked
Or the drive is b0rked
03hm
03well
03I took the disk we had at work
03which works, I used it first-hand
03it didn't report any errors
03so I dunno
12External Hard Drives or GTFO
Cant you use a CD for winXP drivers?
OR was it only floppys?
03floppy
Wow
03I suppose I can try to slipstream it
Its been a longg time since I installed XP on anything
12Blu-rays are awesome too
03well
03it's an old computer
03what else would I put on it
03I tried 7, it had a performance index of like 2.5 LOL
DOS?
Performance index is crap
03with some cheapie 5500s or something
03nvidia ones
03as it had to be AGP >_>
Random 5200rpm laptop drives scores the same as my velociraptor did
03LOL
And the velociraptor was a lot faster, and had far lower seek times
Maybe it is secretly fast.
;p
03>Seagate
03I'm going to just toss that out there
velociraptor is WD
you derp
03is that it says memory SPEED, but it really looks at memory AMOUNT too
10k RPM SATA drives
03as I just added more RAM sticks and the score iwent up
03*went
03ah
03I was thinking barracuda then I guess
Probs
Performance index is just for noobs, srsly, its totally meaningless
03well sigh, wtf do I do about this computer
:/
03it's this old IBM one
03with SCSI hard drive
03the stock XP disc won't find it
Didnt you want to dump the SCSI controller?
03but at least it doesn't bluescreen like it does with AHCI
03it just says "no disk found"
03I did
03but I don't have any IDEs right now
Aahh
03and I mainly wanna make sure the graphics cards work

03XD you would
You want highend AMD cards for bitcoin farming
03yeah

03?
it sorta works, but its awkward & yeah
3D musics?
woww
no, still 2D
i've been mixing in 2D 5.1 for over half a year.
Aww
:<
If you want 3d (with height speakers) you need to go 9.1, 11.1, 10.1, or 22.2
0322.2 LOL
*10.2
03yeah go buy me 22 speakerws
03-w
do you mean, 24?
03and like 5 sound cards
03you said 22
03well
03yeah
03subwoofers
22.
22.2
22+2=24
03so buy me 24 speakers and a few sound cards?
http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/english/aboutstrl1/r1-1-8.htm
see "22.2 multichannel sound for households"
03households?
03More like movie theaters

how about
heck, even over half of daws DON't support 5.1
:o
/me runs
03NHK?
well, you could, but it's extremely hard to manually manage it .
NHK is a broadcaster in japan.
they developed the 22.2 standard in 2005
Urk

You can change that

03I couldn't find an option

03and I searched for like 20 mins

03well
03there are also little dots at the bottom
Yeh.. you defo can
03that you click on to switch homescreens
03I use that quite often
UI settings
Its called "Show desktop indicator"
03o.o
And chose "Indicator type"
03well I'm sticking to the free one for now
EX is just the same but with more options :P
03nope
03they changed the look of the 3 icons at the bottom too0
03-0
Ohnoes they changed the defaults?!

I get a "Non-system or System disk error"

it makes the alignment strip readable

prolly something like that

can I just put the entire laptop in there? ;_;
/me is really too lazy to remove the hard drive

no...
I could try removing the hard drive

Oh
compared to xchat it is horrible
but why can't mIRC handle text?
/me shrugs
It is only a problem when you have a bouncer
you can decrease the buffer
I'm used to xchat which loads the logs in about a second or less
unlike mIRC, which takes nearly 5
which has a damn load of restrictions
How did that happen? o.o
can't use exes
I dunno
it's an old laptop

I need my files off it

http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/internet-memes-katniss-the-liar.png
yeah
Arti fixed the domains after I prodded her about it again
...for now :/
basically
she wants to move the site back to lugia.co.uk and ditch the .us name
or like, she'll have it redirect to .co.uk
but due to some stupid issue which I don't quite understand, she can't have both
it has to be one or the other
and apparently she did something wrong which broke both domains and made them both just point to godaddy LOL
that's....rather amusing
yeah, but it was a bit frustrating XD
yeah
something like that
might as well just make the switch
it's a matter of subdomains though
she'd have to create ocean.lugia.co.uk and all that
hmm
and TOO MANY PERIODS LOL
ohgdufi forgot about that
the sub domais
uh, domaina

you get it.

/me claps
I did that the last time the DNS died

Well they are not really subdomains
Just having lugia.veyka.co.uk point to both servers
12drf
yeah it points to island :P
since I didn't know ocean's IP at the time

hm
Win7 Enterprise does have the language packs
I just tested it on a VM
wasted one of my 500 activations, oh noez :P
oddly enough
it doesn't ask for a serial on installation
and tries to find an activation server
and you have to hit "change key" and then enter it
12Thus why it’s called openwork content management system
12lolwut
12*opensource*
12I've had to work with Joomla too
I thought she did it all in PHP
Its just one of many CMS's
Handcent SMS had an update
now it looks like f***ing iPhone
and you can't change it *that* much :/
12instead you can just do HTML and it automatically converts everything to PHP
02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
hi
12It also keeps everything organized kind of like a control panel on a computer
hm.
but EW DIRECTV
12sure, I could try to help :p
at least it would beat the college's crappy analog cable :/
basically
you enter it and hit "Make link"
and it'll just have a hyperlink that says "click here"
for when you get hotlinks to mp3s etc and the stupid browser plugins take over
12ah
make sense? :P
I had one that worked manually, e.g. you had to do linkmaker.cgi?Paste link here
12yeah XD
:O
hrm
yeah that's fine
12alright
12bbl
Somehow I thought Win7 Enterprise was more like professional, not ultimate
but nice XD
maybe Vista Enterprise is the one that's more in-tune with Business and not ultimate?
Maybe
Havent checked in a while
But it probs is like bizz
my school used to have Vista enterprise
And vista's editions where not supersets like win7's
oddly enough, I think they switched to 7 Pro, not enterprise
same thing with this company
we're using pro, not enterprise
Probs only needed if you have 1000's of computers
prolly, maybe it costs that much
we only have about 50 computers here
and half are still on XP
but the university prolly did have over 1000 computers, between all their labs and all that
they were a bit daft, installing Vista on computers clearly marked as "designed for XP" and then wondering why people were whining about them taking 10 mins to boot >_>
I actually filed a complaint like "your IT department is morons for trying to upgrade old boxes"
I'm not at school again lol
you aren't a fox anymore? :O
/me shrugs
They do that sometimes
Perhaps I am
well, there's a VLK version of pro
it's just strange that they would use that instead of enterprise
especially considering that they had Vista enterprise
that's useful actually
somehow I thought it had to be the same one
As ultimate is the top lvl it should go over anything
yeah
according to wikipedia it does
Of cause
Its just a service
Well.. more like you turn off the indexing
Yeh, pretty sure thats the indexing backen
oh
/me winces
Good jorb
http://www.redmondpie.com/install-any-version-of-windows-7-with-universal-iso-9140092/
thanks
except enterprise
that one's a tad bigger
Enterprise is a diff ISO i think
ywah
*yeah
I just got a speedtest result of 28mbps on 4G LTE

03LMAO
03I'm now a member of the alumni association
03of the college I dropped out of
03that's fairly humerous
/me claps
03well
03I just didn't tell them I was leaving
03I just left
03so my name is still in their system
03and I still have their .edu email
03XD
Ooops
03yeah
03I mean
03I haven't actually taken classes or paid tuition there in over a year
03it's just like, they don't actually look that up
:D
03so maybe if they go purging the database someday they'll be like "wait, what"
12XD
12I think he doesn't get jokes
03well actually I don't know
03I told them I was going to "take classes elsewhere for a while"
12which is a shame :<
03supposedly we hvae to surrender our student ID cards upon leaving the school
Meh :P
03I'll be like
03"I lost it"
Hes a fucking idiot
03because then I can still use that one to get into football games LOL
Good jorb
/me roll roll
My opinion may be coloured by my dislike of the target
;)
And also the effectiveness against said target
As long as it's purple
p-p-p-purrpleee
03anyway
03but it just won't boot on a couple machines i have
/me wonders
drf, never used DBAN tbh
Might be the drive if its more than one disc
03you got another tool for erasing hard drives?
03did it on two drives too
03as in
03I replaced the DVD-ROm drive with a DVD+RW drive
03and it still did it
12oh
The first @hoho is part of the hostmasking
12k
Erm, I normally just use gparted
You are just adding uneeded wear and tear if you do a full wipe otherwise
I think the 2nd part is related to the IP address, and the last part is the rDNS on the IP
Or part of it
03I *am* getting rid of them
03:P
03it's those crappy 40GB SCSI drives
03that I want to toss
03etc
03and since they're SCSI I can't just toss them in anotherg machine
03-g
03well
03That MIGHT work but LOL I'm paranoid and suc
03*such
03ONE of the two IBMs wwas able to boot DBAN
03the other didn't
03so tI could just swap the drives
03I still don't quite understand why
Or plug them all into one
03they're identical machines
Diff bios revision?
03I dunno how SCSI works, that might take some tomfoolery in the bios
03nope
03I flashed them both
Cable bugs
03at the same time
03to the newest one
03cable bugs?
Iffy cables
I dont know, computers do these things
03so :"/
03*:/
03is xboot
SCSI should just be plug and pray
03but it can make burnable ISOs too
03and it uses GRUB bootloader to launch the crap
03I was thinking of turning one of these old crap machines into a nuking station where I can just mount drives and wipe them
03without needing to continually use the CD
Hurrhm
03I know there's CF to IDE
03does CF have locking though?
If it goes after the physical devices
03it searches for all drives
4: $50 nzd itunes card for $40 nzd
want?
03um
03not sure if there's anything useful in NZD store
03well lemme try making an xboot ISO, that might do it
there we go.
actually one sec.
mIRC is glitching x___x
Theres not much point fixing them up anyway tbh :P
Hurrhm
03just to have?
03enterprise computers are slightly lulzy
03hm, k
03because CF -> IDE means less screwing around XD
Shame

Horrid stickmissmatching on the ram

03well;
03I had the 2GBs in my room
03the 1GBs came iwth it
03what else do I do
036GB > 4
The 2gig sticks are diff oems
03...
03LMAO
03see
03those were actually in my dad's computer
03he bought a OEM computer
03Go blame THEM LOL
Boreeee
Ohnoes the wrench of power!11!!oneone!111
03I actually didn't look at the labels, I assumed they matched
OEMs do stupid things to
03yeah
03ironically it was a PowerSpec
03PowerSpec is pretty legit
Never even heard of them
03exactly
03they're a smallish store
03that's *actually good* unlike Best Buy
03not really bigbox no
03there's only like 30 of them nationwide
Aaahh
nooooo'
http://pandaboard.org/content/platform
03http://www.powerspec.com/
03a few of their computers are literally the same price as buying the raw parts by themselves
Thats a horrid website
03plus free support
03yeah
Low/midrange pcs are generally not really worth building tbh
03exactgly
03-g
03my mom's was like $400
03from PowerSpec
03and nowadays I could build her one about twice as good for the same price
03and we added a 9400GT
03yeah
*specific
03so I had the RAM sticks as spares
gah
I spent err
college why do you do this to me
it does not make me feel safe
£1093
wargh
sigh.
And the problem is that I would have to have opened them up and buggered around to get the SSD ect in

03so I can't add an entry?
There are Advanced power menu mods
03hmm
what's going on now?
But generally that means flashing a custom deodexed rom
03well
03I ask because CyanogenMod has a "screenshot" option built into the power menu
03I wanted to add something ismilar using any random screenshot progrma
03*program
sigh you dont wanna know.
12SS is being awesome
12:D
Thats a good one
No its not that easy

If they dont match the file they are compiled from
Alright, seriously, stop it you guys
Then everything breaks
Aka if you make modifications to the apk, you always need to edit its odex file
Its generally system apps that are odexed
and the framework
While there are no rules, respect AND common sense is required

get back to me when you do.
03well
03is there a way to like, make a hotkey
03say power and volume?
03similar to iPhones
HAI
I recall seeing one in Android 3.2
03just power and volume up/down
Find an app that can map itself to a button combo
03yeah but it needs to take screenshots derp
03and there's only a few I've even found
03most of them require you to shake the phone or put some stupid overlay on top of everything
or being used for someone else's stupid games.
er
*TBS
fuck RTS I suck at that
03also can you find me a custom ROM for the Droid 4 that *actually works*? :P
03since all the ones I've seen are experimental and buggy
03so yeah
Go read up on XDA, they have stock based custom roms
Might even had a mod you want
Or even rootzwiki
12SS, someone can only be trolled if they let themselves be trolled
03that site's a bit tl;dr though :/
:P
Not really, just hit the dev section, spend a bit of time reading
03well
03I have safestrap
03hoewve rthat works
/me plays the hunger games with Quilava
12:D
03recovery thingy
03that lets you dualboot
03the " safe" system won't be modified when the other one is messed with
03so you can put a custom ROM on the safe system and not worry about bricking
03the only annoyhing thing
03so I can't do scheduled backups
03I have to do it manually :/
I'll take that as a no.
/me idles
Yuck, sucky locked bootloaders
:/
03Droid 2 had a locked bootloader too and they hacked the vcrap out of it
03-v
fuck i lol'd
Yeh, motarolas gone a bit shovelware with the droids though
03I know :/
03it's good hardware, software is meh
Most dev support is going towards the Razer
or w.e
03for some reason
03it worked when I just deleted Maps as a system app and reinstalled it from the market as a regular app
03not sure why
Probs verizon borking junk
03well
http://a23.catastrophex.com/play.html this
03I flashed back to stock, only unisntalled the non-system bloatware (as in, didn't need root to do it), and it still broke
03it must be Adw's fault
03but LauncherPro crashed it too
03and there's no way to use the stock without removing all custom launchers
03so eh
Thats weird
12Unfortunately I’m not a member of catastrophex and lazy :<
03it is
Probs motarollas crap software
03prolly
03but I got it working now, no worries
03I just reinstalled it as a regular non-system app
12just too lazy to join
kewl
03all you need is the market
03literally all the rest are there
12might later though
I AM AFRAID I CANNOT DO THIS
Mhhm, depends where in the world you are
That you dont get on some phones
03oh
it's just to annoy him really
probably because they know it bugs him

03well I alreayd have the market/play app

10your school computers are governmental?
hah
03I don't know of any ext3 recovery
damn
03but I hvae a nice FAT/NTFS recovery
well
how would that work?
03if you can just pry the drive out and attach it externally
Our School still uses WinXP
Errh
03Nothing wrong with XP
You can recover ext3 fine
and they use IE 8

Tons of programs
03oh wait
03woah
03Diskinternals XD
03I have their Uneraser program
blah blah
03but the one I usually use is called GetDataBack
03it's pretty nice
well
the thing is
03have you tried Parted Magic?
and not hitting the HDD at all
03but no, like I said, physiclaly take the hard drive out
03and mount it externally
it's the hard drive that IS the problem
03you have more than one computer, right?
03Take the hard drive out of computer 1
yeah
03attach it to the working one
03etc
finally
03and run data recovery
drf, the laptop the HDD is in works 100% fine
03unless you don't care about the data
but the hard drive doesn't
03so you don't want to recovery it?
03-y
i do want to
02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
o-o'
You need a working computer in order to pull files
03I don't think you can recover the files without a working OS, and I don't know of any Linux-based recoveries
well
You also dont want to be running from the HDD when recovering
03oh, you want to boot into a live distro and see if you can just mount it?
Thus pull it and connect to another computer
I tried booting into a live distro
03yeah
03that's the best option, mounting it externally
doesn't work
inb4 put in fridge
