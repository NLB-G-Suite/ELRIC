12heck
lol
I didn't cry
I'm the most emotional movieperson
and i didn't cry
03that's the spirit
03;P
03*:P
I bawled buckets in the book
but the movie, they tore that scene apart
12because you were expecting it?
12I never cry when watching movies
12see
12u mad?
/me runs
12my problem was
12at the end
12Katniss's crying
12ruined the moment x.x
12if you've ever seen Vampires Suck
12the Becca's sleep-crying is comparable
12EW Vampire movies
Haha
:P
03I agree, but that movie makes fun of the
03*them
03:P
katniss didn't cry that much in the book
Baby Cathiss
;>
12oh
the whole point was that she wasn't going to lose composure
6she totally lost it
12I must watch that movie then :D
6but they didn't let the audience grow to connect with rue
6like, they barely did
6most people cried cuz they knew her from the book
03I should just burst out laughing at the end when I see it tomorrow
03see what people do
/me hwides
03-w
Do it!

If I was bothered, I would go and do that :|

!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a Aron.
>|
okay
enough with the binary
01110111011010000111100100111111 (why ?)
because it's awfully spammy
it's a way of life
just because it's a way of life doesn't mean it shouldn't be controlled :P
12like saying derp?
12derp
nah
that just gets you kicked by drf
I wonder...
011000100110100101101110011000010111001001111001001000000111001101110101011000110110101101110011 :D
12OMZG APPLE IS AMAZING
not you too
/me runs
Umbreon, if you want a legal justification
12that's what will get you kicked XD
just reference Reynolds v. United States :D
/me runs
wat
o-o
who
nah if you truely want to get kicked
it's a supreme court case that because says religious convictions can't be used to justify criminal offenses :P
you need to say you are a brony
hmm
!mlp
nah he hasn't made one of those yet
12!Pony
12!Ponies
03I should, actually
but Umbreon
binary is illegal in micronesia
and Samoa
what
so all tech is too?
and some other island I can't name
03inb4 Tokelau
03:P
03that's like my favorite island ever
03because they'give away free domain names
12tbh, MLP is starting to irritate me :/
03Only starting to?
12I already dislike the fan base
mlp has been out for ages
cough yugioh cough
MLP is ancient
12MLP FiM
Dexter's Lab made fun of it
it can be found in hierogyphics
look at the similarities btween MLP FiM and yugioh
wait what
they both go on and on and on about the power of friendship
12LOL
yugioh is about friendship?
well that's just crazy
doesn't Pokemon (the anime) have friendship as one of, if not the main theme?
*s
03Well
03if you consider pitting one against another in order to win competitions as friendship
03then sure
/me hides
12most shows do
I doubt friendship is a main theme on 24
/me runs
o-O
!umbreon
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 14 minutes
friendship is always the theme of everyshow
12well, a lot of shows, not all XD
12If I got to make a show, friendship wouldn't be the them :>
/me runs
12theme*
12anyhow, night everyone
night
12And when NS get back I’d like to set up a bouncer
12gets*
12XD
I am back
night
03why does everybody use one of those now :|
03it's so unoriginal
what's your point
bouncer ?
12hurr
yeah
what's that
they should go back to the original 151 bouncers
03real pros just keep their computers on 24/7
I mean
hi
there's no rule against it
/me runs
12well in that case, when I get back XD
03it's like an IRC proxy
I don't
I have limited bw
03I know there's not a rule against it, it's just annoying when you see everybody using bouncers since it gives the false impression that they're actually here, a la Feather :P
Butbut
I say away in my name
;<
^
and it makes it obvious I'm not here
that works
03I still don't see the point LOL
my internet fails often
12anyhow, night
clears up the confusion
:<
03well you're special
04use bouncers when you need logs
03but for people like me, bouncers would be completely pointless
04otherwise just dc
6uh
6why
if that desktop can stay on without getting overheated I'll do IRC on that
6am I still awake
6ffff
Aurora
03Sato it shouldn't overheat
how was the hunger games movie lol
even with 8?
6drake
6that sentence made no sense
6at all lol
I plan on dual booting
6it made me happy but lol
04YOUR FACE MAKES NO SENSE
03the hardware is what makes it overheat, not software o.o
6so does your foot
04I know
04it's embarrassing
04But not as much as your face
04The only person who you'll ever marry is Kosovo
the demand the software has is what I'm getting at
04Because HE'S YOUR SOULMATE
how hard it pushes your system
/me shrugs
Kill feather!
03that and it makes everybody show up as a clone LOL
feather
6koso, it was pretty...um.
6dunno if you read my critique of it on forums
6I basically hated it
you want clones? I'll give you 1200 of them
I hadn't checked the-
actually USPS then drf
oh
:/
6so much potential, lost due to poor cinematography choices
03that's the spirit, hate everything :D
multi-shadow clone jutsu?
6not even related to the story
04shut up we don't need another drf
6and I don't hate everything
/me runs
03yeah but you should
/me hides
6I actually have open mind on most everything
6hell no lol
03and Drake :(
nope, IRC spambots
03We need more drf's
I guess that's a "director's vision vs. reader's vision" thing
04no
04we don't
04at all
04ever
04again
04forever
04infinitum
03>:(
04eternum
drf, d'you want spambots?
03no?
I can get them to PM you too ^_^
03unless you can...yea
03OK
03spam #PM
6koso
03oh
03I misread that
I am the one.
03but spambots on #PM
03is fine
6the director decided that camera shake for effect was necessary for every single scene
nah
03also make them all @find and !list
/me runs
OH
6only like 4 scenes in 2 hours had still camera
04Aurora that makes me think of RED: Darkside Chronicles
03LOL shaky camera
I thought you mean like landscapes and scenery and stuff
in that case yeah that's dumb
6and the camera shake was HORRIBLE.
03Star Trek has that problem
>_<
03but it's a good movie
6nononono I was really impressed with the sets
04no drf
Star Trek 2 is coming though right?
I HATE movies that do that.
03it basically comes down to
03EVERYONE'S A CRITIC
04Star Trek had problem with Lens Flare
/me runs
03lens flare and shaky camera
03both of those
03but I still loved it
it's coming 2013
03I care more about story than anything LOL
04same
I remember watching Cloverfield when it first came out
and hating it
03honestly, the trailer for that movie
03OK well
03Cloverfield
for exactly that reason
03is a retarded movie
04Unless the camera is HORRIBLY DODGY I care more about the story
Iron Man
03it's basically "monster attacks people"
04Iron Sky looks frikkin' hilarious
03that's like a 10-second story
03>_>
aside from the fact that the story was dumb etc.
the camera
I hate ircnet so much
made me physically sick
Iron Man 2 was better than 1 though
03I disagree
03I liked the original Iron Man better
^
how is Iron Man 3 looking to you?
03um
03I have no idea?
OH aurora
I've played kid icarus
for like
11 hours
since friday
and I actually really enjoy it
the controls don't really bother me at all
6lol
03my mom thought that was a movie
The Avengers (2012) looks good
the only thing that bother me is the camera
03when she saw the preview
because you control it by flicking the bottom screen with the stylus
03o.o
and whoever thought of that should be fired
6wuh
03>Nintendo
but other than that
just hope they balance the characters well
6that sounds horrible
03I love when
it's pretty good
03people start fighting me when I say how much Nintendo sucks
03but then at some point they're forced to agree
03:D
:D
:?
nintendo made a stupid decision with that
03they're just nowhere near as good as they were in the 80s LOL
03and 90s
but it's easy to look past because the game is amazing
!ew Playstation Vita
02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW PLAYSTATION VITA
03hey, at least the Vita has been hacked
those were your words not mine man
drf's logic
if it can't be hacked, it's horrible
but yeah I recommend it
03Umbreon, true that
03well
Nintendo 3DS might be getting automatic updates :D
03unless it actually allows open development without needing to be hacked
03a la Android
and now I'm highly considering getting spirit camera as well
03EW AUTOMATIC UPDATES
03Unless they're something like Windows
less power to the player
03as those don't acutally go around removing your software >_>
lol
03Nintendo's updates are like
03"Let's call it a 'security fix' and then remove all their mods :D"
03They've done it several times now >_>
are you supposed to have those mods?
03very carefully®
Nintendo 3DS will be difficult to hack
lol trademark
03I like doing that Umbreon
03same with just works®
03they're expressions I stole from people :P
03anyway
if Nintendo is plugging the holes as they go
Carefully is a registered trademark of Game freak (c) software
hmm
/me runs
03you mean ©?
03go set your keyboard to US International already
/me hides
they're plugging holes that hackers can't find even
03ó.Ô
!ew d®f
02EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW D®F
03erm
03ó.ô
03Sato, that's also because the 3DS has a very small hacking community
03given that most people who actually like gaming don't give a crap about the 3DS :P
drf is a registered trademark of the cynical people of the world foundation
03the Xbox 360 has probably the biggest hacking community of all systems hence why people keep exploiting it after the updates
still no softmod
03and second biggest are probably the iPhone/Android people
03who do jailbreak/root hacks
still hoping though
03Sato, it's impossible to softmod
I will softmod my 360 S so fast
ìsëé
03it's never going to happen.
the moment the exploit is found
03you can reset glitch (equivalent to JTAG) it
03or just flash the DVD rdive to play burned games
I have google news alerts up for it that never changes
never any new stories
don't you think the same was thought of Wii drf?
that we couldn't softmod it
6well
Took 2 years with the Wii
:<
6since the topic seems to have turned to nintendo once again
6I'll take my leave and go to bed
good night rawra
Aurora really hates Nintendo apparently
:>
hmm
03Sato, the difference is that the Xbox 360 runs an actual operating system :P
touche
03Sato, *I* really hate Nintendo too
03but anywa
03y
you don't leave when the topic comes up though
6.
6I leave because I'm tired
night Aurora D:
6and because you've exhausted the nintendo topic entirely.
03the reason the Xbox 360 will never be softmodded is because the system actually does security checks against its software, same goes with the 3DS
6koso
03the Wii was supposed to but didn't in all cases
6before I go
hey did Aurora have some comeback to that
6whats the weather
03so someone found an instance where you didn't need a signed program
I have her on ignore
6lol
03and that's how the hacks were formed
!w 54650
Onalaska, WI: Partly Cloudy and 54°F(12°C)
6good
Fail.
it was rathhhher
sunny today actually
not hot but warmish
6lol
03the Xbox 360 actually reports if you're running unsigned code though
!w 95023
Hollister, CA: rain mist and 47°F(8°C)
03so that means you *can* run softmods but Microsoft will know and ban your console :P
hmm so an exploit wouldn't be easy
6it's raining
thank god too because I was getting sick of the heat lol
6so beautiful
!w Anaheim
Anaheim, CA: Scattered Clouds and 57°F(14°C)
03it would be possible if you don't connect it to the Internet
6and 47
I don't care if my console gets banned
6is so nice
03but how many people use their Xboxes offline?
03that defeats the purpose LOL
03honestly the whole fun of the Xbox 360 is Xbox LIVE :P
I'll play on the J-Tag servers
03jtag requires hardmod dudce
03*dude
I'll play on the non-existent I'm screwed servers
03what you can do is what I'm trying to get done for me, and that's a dual NAN|D
03@*NAND
nice
03it'll have a switch on it
03to switch between JTAG and non-JTAG
who Seiga Kaku r.
03so you can run homebrew and then just switch it back to normal to play online
although before friday
it was like
03best of both worlds
raining
*hard*
wait so if Microsoft bans your console they just ban your NAND?
03they ban the console ID
03but you're missing the poijnt
03-j
03you wouldn't go online with the JTAG NAND
03:P
03then when you do go online you switch it to the normal one
never play online with JTAG NAND
I see
03exactly
03you can use flashed DVD drives though
so what does the reset glitch get me?
free cake
what did the twilight glitch do?
6anyways
6I'm off to bed
night Aurora
night
softmods your Wii Umbreon
good night Aurora
not that I can see you
6haha
o-o
6so much for having me on ignore
go to bed you nintendo-hating evil person :<
but still just got to be polite all the same
/me runs
Aurora is always top dog
:3
6ha.
/me tosses hot dog
6polite is hardly the term
Aurora please defining Seiga Kaku.
6ugh
6alright
is she talking to me at all? anybody?
!pokemon
!touhou
Umbreon, you are 14Mononobe no Futo.
I hate one sided chats
No u ;<
i'm no futo
D:
04Sato
don't use touhou then, or have a fave
I shoudl sleep too...
04Forgive the swearing but
sometimes I think ignore makes things worse
night :V
04You are f**king hilarious
o-o
how so Drake ?
wubwub
wubi wubi
so drf what does reset glitch get me?
:D
I think popcorn is in order, Drake
hermit crab
:s
murhrhrhr
04indeed
03Sato, reset glitch is the same thing as JTAG
!digimon
/me passes Kosovo the popcorn
03it's just the newer version
03since JTAG no longer works
/me eats and passes back to Drake
what does reset glitch require
03the reset glitch hardware? LOL
/me continues eating
03it costs $20
damn
I wish I could get one
hey wait a minute
do you know where they sell those though, I'll just pay that on top of what I owe, oh wait hardmods are difficult to setup
disregard
03LOL
03xconsoles.com
I've ruined consoles trying to hardmod
03yeah
03hence why I'm having a friend do it for me
Sato
03since I can't solder
since you have Aurora on ignore
you should probably act that way
I am?
[18:00:39] <Sato> good night Aurora
[18:00:45] <Sato> not that I can see you
<Sato> is she talking to me at all? anybody?
definitely acting that way
what if I just want to play downloaded arcade titles
6failing at it too
6but that aside
03that requires reset glitch Sato
damn
/me eats popcorn more and passes it to Kosovo
03well
03there are other ways to do it
6just remembered I had a class assignment I should work on
03as in
03some people will give you their profile
6well
03as well as the games
/me eats with intense interest
6a bit of it
03and you can play them using that profile
yeah for a huge jacked up price
03How do you eat a food with intense interest o_O
i'm too tired to respond to that
04Kosovo
03Sato, no
04Impregnable?
03if you go to xbox360iso.com
03it's free :P
free?
FREE?
04We can get him pregnant?
03yes
FREE!?!
gah
apparently so LOL
03some people give their profiles with the game
can I get baned?
banned*
03you'd get THEIR profiole banned :P
03*profile
and my console ID
03yeah I dunno
03all I do is play burned discs
03not arcade games
03so I have no idea
wait so I could legally digi download a for download title
6geez
and have it all be fine by Microsoft
6why am I cold
03you download the game, and then you download the profile that the game was bought with
6I don't get cold, but I'm shivering lol.
for free?
03yes.
why don't you do it then?
03because I don't care? LOL
so you don't know if it works
03I just buy the games I like, otherwise I get trials
03no I don't
what do they get out of this
and how will you run a downloaded game
03nothing, they just buy a profile to use for xbox360iso
you have to pay first
03and you log in as that profile
03no
03you put it on a flash drive
ok
03I dunno dude, sign up for xbox360iso.com and look around, i'm not an encyclopedia
and the 360 properly sees it?
03and I have to go to bed shortly
03yes
03supposedly
03just check on there
I'll try it, thans
thanks*
03and now I'm going to bed
night man
don't forget to ship that out

6I'm assuming an "it" was in there too
6sure yeh
6you want the truth?
6I asked someone who has the power to do something
I'm wanted banned ik this
6because no matter how many times I tried
6you gave no sh*t
I have a right to chat and interact with the people her
here*
gd so many typos
04Yes.
04You do.
Yeah you do, but you have to respect their wishes
sato, you targeting people is not okay
04^
6except you purposely instigate attacks on me
I have infracted on no single rule
6yes attacks, when I've asked you to stop, and then you turn around and do this: http://mibpaste.com/v15XLY
sato
if a person asks you to stop
there should not have to be a rule
to make you stop.
it's called respect
I'm so scared of your big bad logs
07that works
04You should be.
6 2. No flaming other people/websites. We understand that you can't be forced into liking everything/everyone but if you do encounter something you dislike, don't go out of your way to cause trouble.
04/bond one liner
I banned him just then
6 18. Respect other people's wishes. If they want you to leave them alone, please leave them alone.
6there it is
@ Aurora and Drake
6oh he's gone
6darn
6I wanted to shove the rule he DID break in his face
I showed the first one to him
Second one I didn't bother since it's common sense
As for logs
6the second one was awkwardly perfect though
yeah
04Ok
04so it's over
6thank god
I'll post on the forums
6it means quite a bit more than I can actually say in words.
Actually, Kyu, can you tell Articuno? I'm far too lazy to :{D
04Classic NS, right there.
no problems Aurora, he was being an annoying bastard
6lol
and he was breaking rules and what he said to and about you was pissing me off
except drf is in the middle of sending stuff to him
oh well
drf can find him on PM
or email him
04They can find another way
I have his email saved somewhere
actually he emailed me
inb4 he spams me with emails
6ugh
6sorry if that dragged hell on you
04:/
07already?
6I seem to attract the worst people sometimes
04Oh boy
nah, he emailed me before
04Aurora
04you haven't seen the psychos NS gets
well, you are the most talkative
had nothing to do with this
/me hide
lmao
6drake, I've had some crazy ones
6probably not as bad, but not all of the ones I've gotten are online
6I'm the most /defensive/
04As far as I can tell NS doesn't have IRL stalkers
let me show you one example of an idiot
6strong opinions, little tolerance for preaching arses, and bein defensive
6all keyed up for a bad combination
04Aurora stop swearing.

6cardboard box, done.
hello?
12DERP
12ohai there
can i connect to other servers too?
12yep
may i have the command plz
12oh wait, you're using mibbit. In that case I wouldn't know
12/server might work
You can specify custom servers to connect to pre-connect on Mibbit.
03so, I'm seeing The Hunger Games movie later today
back
WB
My sisters and mother went
6drf do you get motio sickness
12nice drf
6motion
yeah it my first time being in here
03uh
they'll be back soon
03not usually
6k
http://prntscr.com/7ek3v/direct
03we're seeing it in IMAX
As such.
will i get logged out here?
03so I sure hope I don't :P
6thats been a problem with this movie cuz of the crazy camera shaking
disconnect or something
03we're going like an hour early so we can fight off rabid fangirls to get good seats :|
6lol
03but yay smartphones, I'll just be on IRC or something
6I'm gonna assume the rabid fangirls were there at midnight
12They did as kind of a censor
03movie's at 6:45 I think
03Aurora, all weekend
12that as*
Most likely this current connection, yes; unless you use a new server tab/connection.
03the movie was selling out even for SUnday
03that and it's IMAX so more people want to see it
6I still hate that all the twitard fangirls migrated to hunger games
03LOL
03I just hate fangirls in general
6so the /normal/ fans are now surrounded by them.
03because they tend to follow anything that's popular
03:P
6yeh
03I mean
03we saw the movie 21 Jump Street last night, and when we were leaving there was a HUGE line for THG
03so yeah, it sells out so much that the fangirls fill up basically all weekend XD
6ok so
12when usig mibbit using mibbit I just open another tab for more servers
12-usig
6we bought tickets when they decided to make two showings instead of one
Another browser tab
?
6we get there that night, there are 8 separate lines
12yep
6EIGHT SHOWINGS.
03LOL
03wow
Baka, etc.
wtf
lol
03as there's only one IMAX
oh ok
6that was ridiculous lol
03so my friend bought tickets this morning
You can have multiple server connections in a single mibbit instance.
03it's prolly sold out already
12when using mibbit*
12asd
03but wow
03my friend was telling me
03that they had to cut some stuff in order to not get an R rating
03is it really that violent? LOL
03I mean, I know the concept of kids fighting each other is
03but somehow THG struck me as a kids' series
is that good?
6drf yeh

[1,0You0,4Tube]: veronica taylor sunnycon part 1 | by | Length: | Views: 27
6it was severely cut down
at about 5:20 there's me askig the question
6and probably one reason why the camera shaking is so bad
arti and rn got to ask first lol
6the book has some pretty gruesome deaths
Multiple server connections in a single mibbit instance is better than several browser tabs for a single server connection each.
6after all, they are kids killing each other
03that's what surprised me about Prince Caspian, a dude got beheaded and it was still PG
6uh
6wait
6what part was that
03when they were all fighting
03Arti was the one who asked "what's your favorite Pokémon"?
yeah
03Nice
03So envious :P
12it was the part Aurora
03I recognized her voice LOL
and rn immediately after
/me runs
03yeah I've never talked to RN so I didn't know her voice
12I actually don’t remember that
OH GOD THE WHOPURGIS NIGHT HAS BEGUN.
Skylands is watching me.
03it's when uh
12then again, I only watched it once
lol I thought I sounded stuttery I was nervous xD
03I'm trying to remember, it was such a long movie
03I remember the one guy was on a horse with a sword
03fighting people
03and someone chops his head off with their sword
03the camera cuts away a little but you can still see it
12XD
12I must have went to the bathroom or something during that part
03LOL spam email

ray
lame excuse
that is all.
I've been on 4 servers on a laptop and lived without nickalert :P
02Sure, because you don't do stuff while on IRC
Just click al the shiny red tabs
02mostly because I hate to keep people waiting
12Blu-Ray :D
12but your name can mean be used in normal terms like ray of light o.e
02and w/o it could take anywhere from 3 minutes to 4 hours to give respone
ray

i know he uses action replay
because i was the one who hacked his team

04I agree drf
14they should have done just one Guitar Hero with like 10000 DLC of songs xD

14I have "Apple" as nick in the first one, "Pear" in the second and "Potato" in the third
14how do I preserve them in case I disconnect?
uh
I can help later
14:D
currently I have like 2% battery so I'll d/c anytime :/
13you will work that battery dry ;3
Viri
when you connect, /server -m server.irc.com -i nick altnick
for each network
that way the nicks are preserved
the -i switch sets the nicks
And drf, he continuously attacked Aurora, refused to listen when I told him to stop it, and then argued with users and staff in here
14o.o
so I banned him
14thank you :D
then he tried to ban evade at least 12 times
/me celebrates
wait you mean sato got banned?
My BOPM got around 10 of them, I banned him a few seconds after he connected for an IP that didn't hit the DNSBLs, and then banned the user info he used to connect with
Yes Nick
/me parties with angel
i'm still in contact with him
10When he evaded, did he use the same nick or a different one?
if any of you need/want to talk
10If same nick, what an idiot
he used the same nick, switched once
which is how I figured out it was him
10Wow.
I ended up banning the second nick
and he was like "how did you figure out it was me?"
10Did he say anything when evading?
10in main chan, that is
14uhm
14how old is he again?
14o.o
wait what
he didn't get time to
10k
my BOPM got him whenever he connected
when was he attacking Aurora again o.o
I didn't see any of that
what element is he?
and the one or two times he got past it I glined him a few seconds after he got in here
10should we ban his forum acc.?
you weren't on
I think Kyu already did
Lol sun and burn dont give it away? :P
10http://www.lugia.us/forum/profile/Satoru/
10[
10[18:40] <Viri> how old is he again?
1017 says his profile
/me checks adminpanel
10no
10Sato is not banned on the forum
LOL perverted car commercials
oh *shrugs*
two mins to the previews, supp8sedly
-8
Lol
10also drf, what's up with all the suggestive ads before the movie?
10:P
skylands
10we had nothing like that
satoru isn't sato
lol well, I don't hate Sato or anything, so
10He is, Koso
10Sato used to go by Satoru
nl
no
Satoru is someone else
10hm
guys
10then where have I seen the name Satoru
let me clear this up right now
Sato is someone else
Satoru is my friend Sky from another site
10Aero, Koso just told me
10I apologize.
alright, sorry
it's okay
now we all know XD
I'm honestly surprised
10DRF, nah, it's just Michigan
/me runs
07which is why I didn't do the forum ban lol
we're that awesome :P
Damn i wish this game had an online feature
/me sighs
I'm starting to feel sick again :/
07shouldn't you be
07like
07watching
07|D
they didn't start yet
I don't think Sato even has a forum account
hence "supposedly"
oh there
bbl guys x.x
that guy had it coming
Well, he refused to listen
indeed
I might actually join the forum
what? skylanders?
Even though I told him several times in the main channel to stop it
And he was horribly stubborn in PM as well
I was reading some sections as a guest and it looks interesting
he was all "I will not be changing my conduct"
that and he had a disregard for basic respect for other people, even in light of rules that actually spell that out.
Yeah, i would kick so much ass
but anywho
!pokemon
Kosoveon, you are a 6Shelgon.

lol we can be chibi pokemon, kos
plus some people I know from other forums are posting

/me uses Doubleslap
pfft
some people don't know that there are TWO Ashachu episodes
Hocus Pokemon and As Clear As Crystal
question: If I evolve, am I Ms. Mime?
07you mean the one that lasted for all of 10 seconds |D
or Mrs. Mime?
lol just awkward rejection
XD
10 seconds is an eternity in ashachu years
for some people
:P
LOL I read that as "and some people"
I'm like "hey be nice!"
Anyone wanna help me with trig homework?
XP
no thanks lol, that hurts my brain
XD
I'm sure youd get some competition
solving trig equations, polar equations, proofs?
/me is officially lost
off to work on govt homeworks
lolk
um
I know but still, it would be sweet
here's the problem
yeah it would
Itd be no fun if i always beat everybody :
:ap
:p
If Cos A = -3/5, find cos 2 A and express in simplest form.
Good lord i have 31 skylanders total jow
Now
Plus 9 extra things
well, you'd have to do cos^-1(3/5) to find the angle, although there are actually two possible angles
your pretty committed to it
I haven't tried getting anymore skylanders stuff lately
I am. How come?
find Kos? ok ^^ *huggles Kos*
wait
lolz
anyway
find arc cosine of 3/5?
/me hugs back
yes
but it's - 3/5
that's what's confusing me owo
I believe that means the angle is negative
o.o
for example
angles can be negative?
yeah
-30 is the same as 330
that confused me too
oh
hahaha imma derp
omg this is why I got a C+ in Geometry sophmore year
math dislikes me strongly
well see Koso
this is what my teacher told me to do
make a triangle and write the numbers on the sides
like
one angle would be A
that works too
and since I got Cos 3/5
because cos a is adj/opp
I'd do adj/hyp
hyp
not opposite
silly kos
oh, right
;P
that would be tangent
anyway yeah
so after I have that
no, that'd be cotangent ;p
I think
oh
because tangent is opp/adj
;3
nonono
yeah
cotanj is um
how come what? me not buying skylanders stuff?
well cosecant is 1/sin
Mainly because the things I want to buy are never in stock
so wouldn't cotangent be like
1/sin / 1/cos?
DRIFTING FROM THE POINT ;-;
Yeah. I see hehe
12WELCOME SOITAL
12HI SOITAL
12HOW ARE YOU
12!pokemon
Soital, you are a Misdreavus.

...
shut up LOL
/me flicks Kosoveon
The main thing I want to get is the legendary 3 pack from toysrus
/me chews
anyway
sec is 1/cos and cosecant is 1/sin
12and 1/cow?
oh yeah
and OW soital, wtf
D:<
12;3
I didnt see one of those today
12mwahahaha
Soital

*e
12maybe posessed by the chicken >:/
Frezno?
Soital, the best animal ever created is the guinea pig.
YOU CAN'T DENY THIS.
12the genius cow*
I found out when Cos(A) = 3/5, Cos2(A) = 7/25
12FIXED
/me huggles her kitty
because Cos2A = Cos^2 - sin ^2
yes?
that is not true, Kos
<Soital> the genius guinea pig*<----fixed
12my HEAD and all this math
:3
12no you
well cos^2(A) - sin^2(S)
yes?
Marth?
he's beastly I know
12they made too many sins
I mean hi
12they're gonna go chicken hell if this keeps up
12D:
13I'm trying to write an essay plan but I can't focus
13or more like my mind doesn't want to
I'm sure ill find it eventually
13:'D
cos2a can also be 2cos^2-1
12quickly draw a cloud
I knwo the feeling AE
12and jot down ideas
or 1-2sin^2
Im sure
honestly, Im supposed to be practing for a speech x.x
12I remember when I had to do that
Im pretty sure two other new ones are coming out soon
but my mind is anything but focused

i learnt what a googleplex was by grade 6
there are much less atoms in the universe than googolplex
it's like setting me the task to write out Pi
no
03I write out pi all the time, just round to 3.14 and call it good :P
because pi length is infinite
googleplex is finite
03here's what you do
oh shush
03you fill one page with 0's
03then find a copy machine
03and duplicate it a bunch of times
03Problem?
but that's pricy
D:
03wait what
03My mom has a xerox machine in her office
03it's free
03o.o
lucky
03who *pays* to make copies trololol
03even at my high school
I have to make copies at the library
03I'd just walk up and do it for free
03because I'm that aweosme
03:P
20 cents a copy
it's annoying
03fine, mail me the paper and I'll do it for you
/me runs
no
stop being so willing to do everything for me
03fine then, be that way D:
XD
the number of grains of sand you could currently fill the universe with
/me goes back to crying in his corner
does not even match googolplex
it's that big
/me slaps Danny
drf, why aren;t you willing to burn mythbusters & kids TS to BD?
03that's what she said
stop w/ the emo bullsh*t
03um
03emo is cutting yourself
03not crying
lawls
03I'm serious o_O
I'm half joking
03so am I, obviously?
ANYWAYS
03though you do make me want to cry in a corner sometimes
03:P
03why a corner? I dunno, it's an expression
Kos, Danny's making me have low self essteem
03I already have them half burned
03and then I just kinda s4topped
I thought you were indepdent
03-4
*n
:<
03Is it actuall ypossible for one to be independent while being in a relationship though? >:P
03because from what I've seen
03the two cancel each other out
true that
not what I meant by that LOL
03sure it's not
you two
dude
get along >_>
its been like half a year
03I would honeslty love to be a superhero so I'd have to excuse to hate everybody :D
get burning or mail them to me
03wait
03I already do hate everybody
03what am I talking about
omg you hate me? YES!
I mean

03why would you wanmt me to hate you?
03*want
03get it right :P
alright I'm leaving before it gets any later
XD
03for the record, I don't hate anybody. I just hate humanity in general, but never specific individuals
but I'm human and am part of humanity
03FINE, and what do you bet tomorrow will go back to me being ignored D:
03I mean

03well I could pretend to hate everyting since apparently people think I do?
/me :D's
03It's just more fun to talk about dislikes than likes LOL
you're asking for me to stay up Kos, cause I get hyper w/ jellybeans
03because humans are cynical by nature
inb4 proof by contrat=diction
/me gives Kosoveon a cake
03if you get hyper over imaginary food that doesn't exist then o_O
who are the 6 people who die in romeo and juliet
/me eats graciously and gives Umbreon cheesecake
it's called immmaggggggiiinaaaatiiooonn
SPOILERS UMBREON D:

/me watches you hold your hands out and form a rainbow
but in order they are:
/me shot

/me eye rolls
03hey, you know what I'm talking about

bed time is calling
damn can't think of the sixth one
I can
03"That one guy" <- solved
I was gonna say the Nurse but I don't think she dies
ohhh for death
I thought you meant chars
<Umbreon> who are the 6 people who die in romeo and juliet
oh
lol
03that reminds me of that one video
that was what I was responding to
03where they spoil the entire last Harry Potter book
03and list all the people who die
03XD
oh yeah, well Hamlet is better!
03inb4 Hamlet 2
was the guy who was spoiling british?
because if so I think I've seen that one
03um
03no

oh nevermind then LOL
03I *have* said video, sec
so yeah Kosoveon

03hey, we share a mutual friend!
*read
/me runs
Kos
03Pssh reading
I READ the play
03sparknotes ftw
I am currently reading Hamlet <3 good stuff
sparknotes only really helps in a handful of instances
ikr?
it tends to leave out some important points
like if you don't get a scene
03yeah but I'm lazy
03I got through school just fine LOL
03never actually read To Kill a Mockingbird, even though we were supposed to
OMG
YOU ARE MISSING OUT
THAT BOOK IS AMAZING
03that was like the fricking worst bo...wait what
03I hated it so much
like, the only thing I ever sparknoted that I didn't read entirely on my own
was Grapes of Wrath
NO IT'S INTENSE
I LOVE THAT BOOK
because that book was ridiciously long and boring
03fine, how much will you pay me to read it
/me hides
ok that book kinda is
03also if you want proof that reading is a huge wast eof your life
03Lord of the Rings.

03LOL
03It's an expressionm
03-m

03anyway
/me yawns
<Kosoveon> was Grapes of Wrath < why do i get the feeling aurora knoes about this book?
same here, danny
03if you feel like actually talking to me tomorrow, cya? :P
03I've never read it but I know about it :P
I don't ?
because we had a long conversation about books and part of that was how much it sucked XD
=/
Kos
and I LOVE required reading books
JohnSteinback
is beast
don't diss him :<
I said grapes of wrath sucked
I didn't say john steinbeck was bad
of mice and men was good
03let's just all agree that Twilight sucks and be done bashing books :P
03wait
as was tortilla flat
03that's the same author?
Grapes of Wrath is long, but I like the messages in it
yes
03:o
03I liked Of Mice and Men
03most people in my class hated it
03never read Grapes of Wrath so I can't comment

03yep
03in IMAX
03It was good
03but like

03the music was lame
6to keep it's PG13
03just to put it out there
6it would have easily been R
03I tend to really love movie scores
6and yeh, the music was terrible
6the music used in the trailer was rumored to be part of the score
6wasnt the case
03usually they use completely unrelated music in trailers LOL
03but yeah, like
Y U NO LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC OUTSIDE OF SCORES?
03the actual concept was really interesting
03that stupid love triangle crap, I'm glad it was mostly cut
03but overall I liked it
6my god the camera shaking OTL
03see
03that bugged me a little but I kinda igniored it for the most part
03you know what's weird, thoguh?
03I dunno if you saw, but last night I felt really sick and nauseus
03but once the movie started I actually fel tBETTER

that's not Android's fault, it's the store that sent me that newsletter :P

LOl hi
oh, Viri, I can now get basically every version of Windows if you needed a specific one for upgrading XD
14o.o
14luv u
14I'm still backupping stuff :(
you have Vista Home Premium?
um
14yeah, but I'm going to format anyway
if you upgrade you don't need to back stuff up
:P
14since it's in italian xD
smart :P
14I can't upgrade if the OS got a different language :(
ah, makes sense
clean installs are better anyway
Ubisoft has surprised everyone by acknowledging restrictive and cumbersome DRM, the one that the company has used time and time again, is not the way forward when it comes to IP protection for games.
trolololol
14lol
14ubisoft games are blarg anyway xD
14except Rayman
14but considering the sellings of the last one, I don't think they'll make another one :(
oh gawd
we need to do stuff with Excel for IT class >.>
what
Excel hates me
well,i am good at anything with Maths, but this is new
Excel is cool
I just hate using it for math LOL
but for actual data? Sure :P
Hi espyschool
waddaya mean, Data
~
Maths is easy :P
I mean data like, numbers?
the actual point of spreadsheets :P
hhmhh
rather than just using Excel to add stuff
in need to copy one layer from a .psd file into a different .psd file in PhotoshopCS4
harder then it looks...
EW ADOBE
whut?
you heard me.
any reason?
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/products/What-is-Windows-7-N-edition <- LOL What
somehow I thought the UK had a version of Windows 7 without IE, not WMP o.o
also because Adobe programs are stupidly bloated
dont rage on me,but whats bloated?
using a lot more CPU/memory than usual
so?
when ya got enought RAM, who cares? xD
eh, that's not the point
that's like saying "I can afford gas, so who cares if I have a car that gets really crappy fuel mileage?"
in my case,
wait nvm
I have 24GB of RAM, sure I can run Adobe programs fine but what if I need to do other stuff?
people think ill brag again .-.
it just limits you regardless because the programs are bloated
:P
good thing im a no limits person :P
ow
my throat just started hurting
get something like a Strepsil, or that kind of candy that betters throats
I'm at work, I can't just "get" anything
what kind of work do you do then?
IT stuff
but I mean, I can't just go to a store...
liek what IT stuff?

so Xanbreon, someone suggested this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103249 <- but you'd still need a BIOS update for AM2+?
Sugested it for what?
The AM2 computer?
yeah
I wouldnt go above the 6000 AM2 stuff
6000?
We went though this last time
I would stick to Ahtlon 64 chips unless you know it got an update to support K10 chips
w/e
I'm currently trying to figure out why the frick my phone won't send texts
I didn't disable anything related to texts
like it just sits there spinning the stupid progress thing and the messages never actually go through
You broke your droid
again
First thing to check is if your carrier is having issues
Did you remove STK?
STK?
Sim tool kit
um
no
I just used autostarts to disable most of the bloatware
Might not exist on CDMA phones
but that shouldn't affect *sending* texts
and even then, everything is enabled on SMS receive except Remote Web Desktop o.o
Thats on receiving not sending
I just said that
see, I just sent a test message to my email
nothing happened
and where it usualyl turns into a "message sent" symbol, it's just spinning OSX_style
Reboot
I already did
I'm not that daft LOL
ANDROID IS A STOLEN PRODUCT! :D
No comment
O. O omg
Checked your provider?
win 7 is very fast
no, but I'm sure it's not a Verizon problem
Yes it is.
:P
maybe take the simcard out and put it back in?
Sure, why not
installing drivers
power off first? :P
Durr
Generally a good idea
:P
lol
wtf seriously...someone on the HoR server is claming that im impersonating them.
the logon screen pops up before the sound finishes
xD awesome
with THIS nick...
let's see what happens if I start it up with no SIM card
so Xanbreon is it actually possible to "clone" a SIM card like they do in spy movies? LOL
Yes
You can also clone phones via the IMEI
what's that, is that like the MEID number?
yeah I notice the Droid 4 calls it IMEA
*IMEI
Basically the phones serial number
hm
the older phones I have
have ESN and MEID Hex
ESN is the CDMA/early FCC version of the IMEI
so you can clone ESNs?
and MEID is the replacment of ESN as they ran out of ESn numbers
Probs
LOL it just whines about not having a SIM card
right, I'll insert it again
a bit of a pain with this phone as it's not meant to be removed
and rebooting with the SIM card back in
Force all the covers off!
:D
OK so the voice works, I just called someone
let's try text again...
yeah nope it's not going :/
anyway I'm going home
I'll deal with this later x.x

03hm?
someone stole a nick of mine and is trying to be me...
03on here?
like really
no
on HoR
03so how does this concern me
03you know I don't like or care about HoR
who the f*ck wants to be me
idk.
i know :P
12you have to type /forum drf
12dunno why
03wtf?
03yeah but oddly enough, ocean.systemnet.info didn't work either
03and that usually does o_O
03so anyway
3RAM: Used: 2074/8192MB (25% Load)
03Got more memory in my laptop
03so I now have 8GB in here :P
03it's only got two RAM slots so I got 2 4GB laptop memory sticks
12XD
12those must have costed a lot
03like $40?
12you can get ram for that cheap now?
03yes
03DDR3 RAM is dirt cheap
03you can get 8GB for desktops for $30
12I'll have to remember that LOL
13I crave for a milkshake
13and we don't have any
13FML
12D:
13and if I can't have a milkshake, I'd normally get a glass of coke instead
03wtf
03my cable is skipping
13but I can't have that either cuz I have to cut down on acidic drinks
03like a bad DVD

03yep
03apparently

12when I got DDR SD ram for my desktop it costed $80 for 1GB of it
12that was a few years ago
03well
03your computer might not have DDR3
:/
03DDR2 is still stupidly expensive x.x
how would i be able to know.
?-.
03CPU-Z
12ah
03it'll tell you the specs
03DDR3 is only cheap because it's current-generation so it's mass produced
03for the same reason that DVD burners are like $20
03I got one for $17 even
03but that old computer of mine uses DDR2, I was looking up prices, 4GB costs like $60
03where 4GB of DDR3 is $15

03I'm going to go yell at Articuno again >_>
13forum loads fine for me?

03does it?
03are you using lugia.us?

03you can get 2 4GB sticks for $30 total
03but it all comes down to what the motherboard supports, it might be 2 max
03as in 2 per slot
ah
03that's even cheaper XD
03well, sorta
03as in, 2 2GBs is like $30
03*20
where do you get RAM?
03so obviously 8GB for $30 is a better value

03yes it does...
13imageshack resizes files, not tinypic

Godaddy is pretty crap, so that might be half your problem

13click it and you get the full-sized image?
03what do you think I just hotlinked?
03yep, even when you click "view raw image"

03:P
13LOL whatever
03regardless, imgur or gtfo
03but it's overloaded right now
13i don't see much of a difference, you can still see what's on the image o.o
12it's called that because the URL is tiny
Oh noes it cut it to 1600x1000

it's not against the network rules

no need to ask
03ew fail they're DRM'ed
03waaaaaaaaaaaait, if this pre-authorizes the DRM... I might be able to use this to decrypt DRM :o
I like how "Internet Explorer 9" is unflagged in Windows Updates
03yeah
as if they gave up
xD

03so HML
03I got my Dell MCE disc
y8
yay
?
03it's orange-ish?
03and a DVD
INB4 No me gusta
uh
03I do like the GUI XD
more like redish for me
03it's really odd
03uh
03orange and red are similar enough
03we're boys, we aren't supposed to see colors well
/me runs
;D
03no but anyway
03you know what's weird?
03It includes a crap-ton of bonus content, and after the OS is installed it starts flashing a commandline and tells you not to remove the disc LOL
here
http://img87.exs.cx/img87/1228/dutchdellmce1bg.jpg
THIS
:P
03oh
03mine includes media rollup 2
in english n' all
same
but MCE is cool, right?
what other extras are there? xD
03it's decent
03I mean I'm just running it in a VM
03uh
03it's a *DVD*
03It has like 2GB of extras
03LOL
03mostly videos and crap
03but oddly enough
03they're DRM-protected videos, but yet the system was never individualized for DRM o.o
03it's magic®
is that a good thing(tm)
03well
03not really, as I can't use it to decrypt stuff :/
03though I do get legit MCE keys through TechNet if you need ISOs/serials XD
03http://www.ebay.com/itm/190654746553?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649
03exact item I bought
okay
yeah
same disks as I got
I have my old soundblaster disk too xD
03except it's orange and has media rullup 2 :P
03*rollup
03so uh, there's only two service packs for MCE?
nono
My XPS/MCEXP is on SP3
I had to update it to SP3 though
hrm
03well yeah
03supposedly media rollup 2 is the newest version of MCE hence why I asked
Newest OEM
:P
Disk version but yeah
newest you can get from Dell :v
03newest version they made
03as in
03they never bundled it with SP3
03unlike regular XP
03but that's because MCE kinda died
What a shame
MCE is fun
03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/video-game-memes-but-i-loved-the-red-light.jpg
03What DOES that button do?M
03-M
oh
I know
for PS1, switches between the dpad and sticks
my logitech controller has it too
03the games couldn't just use both?
Ape Escape (PS1) used pretty much both sticks and the dpad, from what I've seen
Most older PS1 games didn't have or use the stick
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/PS_Controller.jpg < original PS1 xD
sucked really badly
03yeah
03as in, SNES ripoff
03:P
ahem
SNES CD much?
:P
03SNES CD?
http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/media/27664/4/2.jpg < Whatever was made/suppose to fill this hole *giggle*
Think Sega CD, but Sony+Nintendo
they pretty much exchanged ideas for the SNES' addons
Nothing ever happened though
03Nintendo used Splash! But nothing happened!
03trololol HML
03guess what the name of the seller is
03that sold me that MCE disc
MCP?
:p
03HyperFocusPro
03same first word :P
:O
nice
03I always LOL when people sell OEM discs and then eBay removes them *after I buy them*
03since you aren't allowed to sell OEM software without hardware
03it's retarded LOL
so like, I upgraded my laptop's 2GB SD card to a class 6 4GB card that was only 20$ here ;-;
big improvement </semi-sarcasm>
03see, this pisses me off
03The version of Windows you are running is no longer available for purchase.
03Check to see if your PC can run Windows 7.
03What if it can't?
03then you have to resort to piracy :P
03which is what I'm gonna do
Pirate ...what?
LOL
03because it's whining that I haven't activated it
03activation.
03it's a dell disc
oh
03and it doesn't like VMs
03:P
03luckily I have an XP activation crakc
03*crack
well hurr I do have my XPS PC that has the silly serial on it
could use that for my VM if I ever make one

Okay
PIRATE ALL THE PS2 games
I remember the first PS2 game I pirated...kinda
:o
03Yay pirating PS2 games
Well
There was no point as
> No hacked PS2
> No DVDs
but you see
I needed to test out the horribad PCSX2 to play Sonic Heroes
03installing SP3 on this MCE
the game was 3-4GB and took 1 week to torrent.
that was like 3 years ago
drf: i have 2 slots for Ram, if i take the old ram out can i put new ram in place of it. o.o
yes you can
UNLESS IT is Super RAM
03yes
03t0hat's the whole point
03but the question is, what's the max that each slot supports?
03if it's 2GB, you're already maxed out on one
i have 3GB of Ram but only 2.6 is available. i think
32bit
03no
03onboard graphi*cs

but then again
someone beat me to that anyway
03wait, what?

03oh
03yeah but he's paying me for it

03$150
03it's actually a really beastly computer for the price
._.

03it's a refurbished HP business computer
03and business computers are awesome
03you can put up to 8GB of RAM in there
03problem is it's DDR2 so the RAM is expensive :/
>HP
Anti-DDR2 propaganda time
>Spyware
meh
LOLSpyware?
03it's refurbished
03meaning it comes with a fresh installation
03no spyware :>
o
:O!
03yeah
03it's pretty legit
Amazingright

03plus I gave Sato a Windows 7 disc
03it came with XP
03so eh

just loaded HP crap that isnt needed
03yah
03*yeah
03all brand-name computers do it
03hence, wipe them out asap
03and just fresh install XD
03the serial number on the sticker should be valid
03and you can get the ISO from anywhere
i still don't get what the analog button on the PS2 controller does

03I swear these were all legally obtained *ahem*
ewww
drf is part of team rocket
03I said legally obtained :P
I mean really, every state has it's own accent in the midwest
03orlya?
03-a
WI is different than MN, trust me
03Never had anyone tell me I had an accent
Umbre can agree
03except people from like, New York
03but they all suck anyway
/me runs

03prove it
another example is you danny

Now HML, I hate him, what a wanka
03if your amount of swearing is trying hard
03then I'd hate to ese you not trying
03*see
03:P
No, thats just me normally
drf is so silly
03Fricking floppy disks
03not a single one of these acutally works
03I need some for this computer
Fricky fricking fricks
03as I need SCSI drivers
03and it's XP
03you need floppy :|
Haahaha
03inb4 slipstream
03I *could*
03but I already have hte .ima file of the drivers
I chucked out all my floppydrives
03I have a USB one
03actually got it from a dell laptop
03for like $5
03anyway
Not sure if a usb floppy will work for XP driver disc
03no
03I mean
03to write the disk
Gotcha
03the computer I'm installing it on has one built in
03but that's now two floppy disks th1at have sector errors
03LOL
03one of them gets to 1% and dies
Lawl
03the other wrote 100% but the XP setup was like "error reaidng file"
03*reading
Old arse dicks
03I guess I'll go find more
03yeah
03and I'm going to assume tha twas a typo :P
03inb4 no it wans't
03*wasn't
03god dang it I need to stop typoing
Oh bugger
That one was a typo
:P
03floppy disks, giving HD a new meaning since the 80s
03:P
The problem is that 3.5 floppys aint floppy
03they are if you take them apart
now the 5inch ones, they are floppy as helll
Sure
But the 5inchers flopped around like no ones buissness
03XD
03yeah
And you didnt even need to get the black bit out
03I destroyd a couple of those
03what sucks though
03is I just got this combo drive
IMA SLAPPING YOU WITH MY 5INCH BLACK ONE
:D
03that reads/writes both 5" and 3.5" floppies
Sorry
03and I don't have a single 5" one to try it out with anymore
03since I threw all of ours out LOL
5"'s are totally dead
03I know
if 3.5s are pretty dead
I mean
03well so are 3.5s
03:P
03I just love how
XP drivers discs!
03everybody and their brother used floppy disks for everything
03but those are such crappy formats
CD-RW's sucked
03like those discs don't last 20 years
03XD
03I know right
03you know what sucks even more?
03DirectCD
DVD-RW's also sucked
03I used to use that back in teh XP er
03a
The hell is directCD?
03some retarded proprietary crap
03where you could lioke
03*like
03write a single CD-R more than once
03it was multisession crap
03required special software to read/write
03actually
Ooohh
03XP had it built in for writing
03it asked you
03if you wanted to do DirectCD or normal
03at least on my Dell, that coulda been their crap, dunni
03*dunno
Weird
Meh, flash is rocking
Life sucked before flash
Burning CD's of junk
Losing CD's
Burning more
Finding said CD but not having a clue what was on it, cos you didnt bother to lable it
Then losing it again
03OK WTF?
03it gave me the same error
03something about line 1747
Finding it, but its scratched now, and the lable rubbed of, so frack it, it can become a cup coster
Maybe the file you made is b0rked
Or the drive is b0rked
03hm
03well
03I took the disk we had at work
03which works, I used it first-hand
03and used winimage to make a .ima
03it didn't report any errors
03so I dunno
12External Hard Drives or GTFO
Cant you use a CD for winXP drivers?
OR was it only floppys?
03floppy
03it even says, insert a disk into drive A
Wow
03I suppose I can try to slipstream it
Its been a longg time since I installed XP on anything
12Blu-rays are awesome too
03but slipstreatming tends to screw stuff up
03well
03it's an old computer
03what else would I put on it
Im full of "meh" about blueray
03I tried 7, it had a performance index of like 2.5 LOL
DOS?
Performance index is crap
03I finally replaced those faulty video cards
03with some cheapie 5500s or something
03nvidia ones
03as it had to be AGP >_>
Random 5200rpm laptop drives scores the same as my velociraptor did
03LOL
And the velociraptor was a lot faster, and had far lower seek times
Maybe it is secretly fast.
;p
03>Seagate
03I'm going to just toss that out there
velociraptor is WD
you derp
03now, one thing I will agree on in terms of broken-ness
03is that it says memory SPEED, but it really looks at memory AMOUNT too
10k RPM SATA drives
03as I just added more RAM sticks and the score iwent up
03*went
03ah
03I was thinking barracuda then I guess
Probs
Performance index is just for noobs, srsly, its totally meaningless
03well sigh, wtf do I do about this computer
:/
03it's this old IBM one
03with SCSI hard drive
03the stock XP disc won't find it
Didnt you want to dump the SCSI controller?
03but at least it doesn't bluescreen like it does with AHCI
03it just says "no disk found"
03I did
03but I don't have any IDEs right now
Aahh
03and I mainly wanna make sure the graphics cards work
03etc
03I could do win7 but it's a royal pain since no DVD drive
Slipstream
03and it won't boot from USB
03it's fricking retarxded
03-x
Old thus no USB boot support
d3rp
03well
turn the old PCs into bitcoin miners ;
l3
;3
03it supports USB DVD drives
03just not flash drives o_O
03which is how I got 7 on there LOL
03but it was reading slow as frick
03took over an hour to install
03anyway um
03hm
Yeh, you would spend more keeping the things on than you would earn farming on those PoS's
03XD you would
You want highend AMD cards for bitcoin farming
03yeah
03I wasted so much fricking money on those
03I'm ;a bit pissed still
Well.. 6800's?
03because bitcoins are a waste
Or meh
03uh
035200 ors omething
03some AGP cards
I know what a 5200 is
Everyones had a FX5200 in there lives
I was talking about for farming
Srsly, everyone I know has had FX5200
Probs cos they where dirt cheap
03yieah
03-i
03that's why I got them
03:P
And could almost maybe do some 3D if you asked them nicely
03anyway brb I'll just grab the CD and dump it on here and try to slipstream the f'ing thing
And prayed to the gods of GPUs
gl&h
+f
Hey
What?
My HD 4350 plays Portal fine
FX5200, nvidia card
At near HD resolution xD
This is from back when nvidia used 4 numbers in there model numbers
*from when nvidia had 4 numeral model numbers
So what about it?
:P
waitwhat
hm
OLD AS <censored>
<censored>
Oh bugger
lol
sh1t is a crap thing to have censered
When crap isnt
....
03mine's a 5500, not 5200 actually
03the one I got
The frack is up with that
U mad
03um
i totally mad
03because the first is actually swearing and crap isn't?
They mean the same thing, and are basically interchangeable

They are the same word..
Its just stupi
+d
03so's your face
03etc
12no, they just have the same meaning
Your mother etc
I am having a really hard time working out why anyone would be offended by one but not the other
12the only word worse than S*** is the F word

Well derp, I know that much
lololol
Shit
Im just saying the weight given to some words over others, even when there is little distinction in there meaning or context they can be used in is stupid
I'm taking my last prereq class in college for the summer, supposed to be the toughest class
its going to suck :/
03well it's like how "piss" isn't considered swearing at all where I live but to you Brits it is
03it's just cultural stuff and around here that word is a lot worse than "crap"
inb4 clbuttic
Piss is really not a swearword
Ill say "im going for a piss" anytime
:/
We just like to say piss off
:D
wb Suinide
12Xan, do you swear a lot IRL? XD
Frack = BSG frell = farscape

But I speak more eloquently
As I dont have to worry about spellings
12thought so XD

So yeh, I swear quite a lot
I dont really give a toss
I say bugger a lot more IRL then online though
/me tosses Xanbreon
rrrr?
12Just was wondering since some people swear a lot online but don’t IRL

Noes we will never get rid of you
I mean yay

03yay 99% expert keys
03LOL multitracks of the Pokémon theme song from RBY
03this amuses me
cool
What song
03I saqw
03*saw
03I don't have 5.1 on here.
03and HML, the theme
03like
03the thing that plays when you turn the game on
odrflaptop
03?
i was playing around with a 2.0 to 7.1 upmixer today to see if i can stereo rotate (similar to matrixing) music such that i can place it eactly where i want it to
it sorta works, but its awkward & yeah
3D musics?
woww
no, still 2D
i've been mixing in 2D 5.1 for over half a year.
Aww
:<
If you want 3d (with height speakers) you need to go 9.1, 11.1, 10.1, or 22.2
0322.2 LOL
*10.2
03yeah go buy me 22 speakerws
03-w
do you mean, 24?
03and like 5 sound cards
03you said 22
03well
03yeah
22.
22.2
22+2=24
03so buy me 24 speakers and a few sound cards?
http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/english/aboutstrl1/r1-1-8.htm
see "22.2 multichannel sound for households"
03households?
wow
03not even IMAX has 24 speakers
03inb4 you start doing 22-channel remixes
do you mean 24?
/me hides
http://www.bronyradio.com/ < dude on air is great, give it a listen, theres not much pony so ff
:3
well, the tools for 22.2 mixing is baisically nonexistent outside NHK, iirc.
how about
heck, even over half of daws DON't support 5.1
we mix stereo 12 times
:o
/me runs
03NHK?
well, you could, but it's extremely hard to manually manage it .
NHK is a broadcaster in japan.
they developed the 22.2 standard in 2005
03so Xanbreon, apparently the text message dillemma was Handcent SMS's fault
Urk
I'm so out of it
03I deleted my texts and uninstalled handcent, sent a test message with the stock app and it worked fine
I dislike 3rd party sms apps
:/
03but I hate the stock app
03Handcent is awesome
I jumped when my parents opened the door to my room lolol
O-o
03LOL what

Well, CM9
03yeah
03There's a CM9 for my phone but it's buggy as frick so I'm not gonna bother yet XD
Theres a AOKP port for your phone you know

03it's not CM9 eis it?
03-e
Like CM9
Some bugs, go check XDA
03like the wifi not working? >_>
wifi works
O-o
03not on CM9
I think bluetooth is iffy though
03:/
03I actually use bluetooth
http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1502
you need to fade it in and out in the center channel, afterwards, fade it in and out for the right, fade it in and out for the right surround, etcetc
tldr too tedious.
Looks like bluetooth audio doesnt work
But unno
Go have a look
03meh
03I'm fine with stock+ADW Launcher
03btw
03I wasted $3 on ADW Ex and didn't like it
03for some reason
03it actually removes some of the GUI stuff of the free one
03like the desktop dots
You can change that
It has like 4 dot styles
03I couldn't find an option
If you mean the indicators as to which homescreen you are on
03and I searched for like 20 mins
03yeah
03well
03there are also little dots at the bottom
Yeh.. you defo can
03that you click on to switch homescreens
03so you don't have to drag your fingers
03I use that quite often
UI settings
Its called "Show desktop indicator"
03o.o
And chose "Indicator type"
03well I'm sticking to the free one for now
03as that's what CM7 uses and I'm too used to it
EX is just the same but with more options :P
03nope
03they changed the look of the 3 icons at the bottom too0
03-0
03added some stupid drop shadow behind it
Ohnoes they changed the defaults?!
03I couldn't find a way to change that back
How will you ever live with the ability to change it
03I was playing with the settings
03LOL
03anyway
03brb
Thats like, in the theme settings
You can turn it off

I WON'T GET YOU, OUT OF MY MIND
I FEEL LOVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND I KNOW THAT ITS TRUE I CAN TELL BY THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES
/me HIDes
o_O
okay...
any ideas what to do junh?
dude, it's a song
I get a "Non-system or System disk error"
put it in the fridge?
or freezer in a zip-lok bag?
and HDD self-test via BIOS gives Read Failure
what would that do?
THATS what drf/fma did
lmao
it makes the alignment strip readable
Ah
you jknow how when things get hot they ecpand and when they cold they contract?
Ah
prolly something like that
well
can I just put the entire laptop in there? ;_;
/me is really too lazy to remove the hard drive
damn screws
HD case
do you have one?
no...
I could try removing the hard drive
but it's painful as the screws = FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
put it in a moisture-proof bag or container
i don't want you screwing up more than your HD.
if htis fails
well I could attempt to remove the hard drive
don't want to screw much up though
I'm not that good with hardware
i'm not that good either

Did your internetz die?
nono
myeverythjng
died.
.v.
Oh
compared to xchat it is horrible
the interface is excellent, and I love that, as well as the scripting
but why can't mIRC handle text?
/me shrugs
It is only a problem when you have a bouncer
you can decrease the buffer
I'm used to xchat which loads the logs in about a second or less
unlike mIRC, which takes nearly 5
even CGI:IRC does it better
my laptop's hdd failed so I'm using a gov laptop atm
Well, they're kinda both basic :|
which has a damn load of restrictions
How did that happen? o.o
can't use exes
I dunno
it's an old laptop
oh, fail :|
but yeah
I need my files off it
which I dunno about now since it's giving non-system/system disk errors left and right
can't even live boot
/me yawns
I've been sleepy all day
Too little or too much sleep?
anyway
I have a headache from lack of sleep

oh so irc works now
yeah
Arti fixed the domains after I prodded her about it again
...for now :/
wait so what happened
basically
she wants to move the site back to lugia.co.uk and ditch the .us name
or like, she'll have it redirect to .co.uk
but due to some stupid issue which I don't quite understand, she can't have both
it has to be one or the other
and apparently she did something wrong which broke both domains and made them both just point to godaddy LOL
that's....rather amusing
yeah, but it was a bit frustrating XD
yeah
so i'm assuming she's trying to figure out what broke
something like that
I asked if she can leave the IRC domains alone but who knows if that'll be possible :/
might as well just make the switch
she'd have to create ocean.lugia.co.uk and all that
hmm
and TOO MANY PERIODS LOL
inb4 that's what she said
ohgdufi forgot about that
forgot about what?
ah
uh, domaina

Win7 Enterprise does have the language packs
I just tested it on a VM
wasted one of my 500 activations, oh noez :P
oddly enough
it doesn't ask for a serial on installation
and tries to find an activation server
obviously it fails
12Joomla is web software used to manage articles, templates, and other stuff on your website.
and you have to hit "change key" and then enter it
12Thus why it’s called openwork content management system
12lolwut
12*opensource*
/me had to work with Joomla in his software engineering class two semesters ago
12I've had to work with Joomla too
not really sure I get what exactly that does, though
12drf, everytime Arti writes an article on the main site of TST she needs joomla to do so without doing a bunch of PHP
I thought she did it all in PHP
Its just one of many CMS's
and god dang it
Handcent SMS had an update
now it looks like f***ing iPhone
and you can't change it *that* much :/
12instead you can just do HTML and it automatically converts everything to PHP
my biggest beef is that it now shows the person's phone number, not just their name
so I can't just screenshot texts anymore
I'd have to blur their number out >_>
12and it's opensource so if you want to do PHP you can
hi
12It also keeps everything organized kind of like a control panel on a computer
hm.
For your living convenience, our apartments include on-site laundry facilities, complimentary parking, utilities, local phone, RocketNET high-speed internet and DirecTV with HBO--we also have storage units available for rent!
I wonder if RocketNET is any good
but EW DIRECTV
12sure, I could try to help :p
at least it would beat the college's crappy analog cable :/
basically
what I want to do is make it so it'll have a form (text box like thing)
that says "Enter your URL"
you enter it and hit "Make link"
and it'll just have a hyperlink that says "click here"
that way you can right-click and save as
for when you get hotlinks to mp3s etc and the stupid browser plugins take over
12ah
make sense? :P
I had one that worked manually, e.g. you had to do linkmaker.cgi?Paste link here
but it doesn't work under Windows Server
so I'm thinking something more userfriendly where it'll actually prompt you with a box
but obviously plain old HTML itself won't be enough :/
12yeah XD
:O
hrm
12Well, right now my mom wants to take me shopping so I’ll have to help you in a few hours
yeah that's fine
12alright

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions#Comparison_chart <- ah you were right Xanbreon
Somehow I thought Win7 Enterprise was more like professional, not ultimate
but nice XD
maybe Vista Enterprise is the one that's more in-tune with Business and not ultimate?
Maybe
Havent checked in a while
But it probs is like bizz
my school used to have Vista enterprise
And vista's editions where not supersets like win7's
oddly enough, I think they switched to 7 Pro, not enterprise
same thing with this company
we're using pro, not enterprise
so apparently 7 enterprise is harder to get approved for? LOL
Probs only needed if you have 1000's of computers
prolly, maybe it costs that much
we only have about 50 computers here
and half are still on XP
yay Dell activation :P
but the university prolly did have over 1000 computers, between all their labs and all that
they were a bit daft, installing Vista on computers clearly marked as "designed for XP" and then wondering why people were whining about them taking 10 mins to boot >_>
I actually filed a complaint like "your IT department is morons for trying to upgrade old boxes"
I'm not at school again lol
you aren't a fox anymore? :O
/me shrugs
Maybe MS save them pro for free
They do that sometimes
Perhaps I am
well, there's a VLK version of pro
it's just strange that they would use that instead of enterprise
especially considering that they had Vista enterprise
LOL what, you can in-place upgrade any version of Vista to 7 Ultimate
that's useful actually
somehow I thought it had to be the same one
As ultimate is the top lvl it should go over anything
yeah
according to wikipedia it does
LOl you can turn off Windows search?
Of cause
Its just a service
Well.. more like you turn off the indexing
so that disables the searchbox?
Dont think so
no I mean in "enable/disable Windows features"
Yeh, pretty sure thats the indexing backen
oh
would be lulzy if you could turn off the search box
owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww I just poked myself in the eye with a pen
/me winces
Good jorb
hey, you got the instructions for editing the Windows 7 ISO to let you pick your version?
http://www.redmondpie.com/install-any-version-of-windows-7-with-universal-iso-9140092/
thanks
I noticed they're all teh same size so yeah
except enterprise
that one's a tad bigger
Enterprise is a diff ISO i think
ywah
*yeah
Holy crap dude
I just got a speedtest result of 28mbps on 4G LTE
That's amazing LOL
wait, Xanbreon, this thing wants me to select a patch file... I thought I REMOVE a file?
Did you download the right tool
As there is two
you want the ei.cfg removal utility
both links go to the same file
Not the edition switcher

Vodka, and strip spin the bottle
That was a good evening
I still cant remember it all
;--;
Cheated on a test, fell asleep in class, stole something (I was little, give me a break), cried yourself to sleep, been in love, got caught doing something you shouldn't have been doing, done something you regret, POSSIBLY peed in the pool, can't remember. As for the rest, use your imagination or PM me :P
We played a drinking game a while ago were if you lost, you didn't get a jaegerbomb.
Because jaeger is full of win. :P

Dear God, I can't believe I just typoed 'where'.

So about 6 of us at school have decided to pick back up the gameboy colours and play through red/blue/yellow.
you don't get nice 1/2 consise summaries in wikis. they often have a lot of fluff and save the juicy bits for later.
Going well so far. :P

I had some Mario and very very primitive Pokémon ports on my 83+
6I know
6I was on about the angle of the image

6oh and shinki is in there somewhere too, probably between toyosa and mokou
/me 6slams head
the only time yukari isn't sleeping is when she's changing touhouland borders and trolling?
6pretty much
6xD
13Rawra you floof, you should narrow that list down to five characters and five only :P
/me runs
my favourite is suika because she's cute.

6not just that though
02Wait, it was March?
6assuming we follow pattern
It still is March
6we should be seeing trials for a new touhou game this coming month
13Ooooh, I approve of this :D
13<3
6well
6depends
6assuming it'll be a full game, not one of the side games
6like UNL, SWR, and fairy wars
.............
6hmm
6unless he's gonna wait for reitaisai 9
6which would make sense
13Fairy Wars hurts my left hand when I play it
13and I can't get used to the controls
6which means we're waiting til late may.
13asdfghj
you know what hurts my left hand?

13PCB will always be my favourite Touhou game though :3

/me pokes Espeon.
13Raaaan
13play eet
13and meet your Touhou self :'D
6you should at least give it a try
i've never played Touhou
6see if you like it or not

I heard it's stupidly addicting
hence >not playing it
yet you played Angry Birds
/me hides
how many times do I have to say this
I heard it gives you grey hair
Angry Birds actually has an ending
02I'm totally up for giving it a try, I just don't know where to start lol
and not 27 different games
13Touhou isn't for everyone, but yeah you should try it :P
/me already has grey hair lol
maybe 7
o_O really?
13I originally didn't think I'd like it at all when I saw gameplay
13then I tried
SIGH
13and I was like "ohay this is fun"
where's espeon
need him for a sec.
133 years on and I'm still playing it
why, need someone to own?
/me hides
13!espeon
No.
Need his assistance elsewhere.
Angel that's my point
13Am I not a good enough Espeon for you? D:
about it being stupidly addictive

just to be sure
02Depends on the person :D
04You're a good enough Espeon for me AE :<

03LOL what
Hes an idiot
12foreveralone.jpg
And far to easy to troll
^__^
03LMAO
03I'm now a member of the alumni association
03of the college I dropped out of
03that's fairly humerous
/me claps
03well
12I've trolled him with out trying to troll him before :(
03I just didn't tell them I was leaving
03I just left
03so my name is still in their system
03and I still have their .edu email
03XD
Ooops
03yeah
03I mean
03I haven't actually taken classes or paid tuition there in over a year
03it's just like, they don't actually look that up
He doesnt need direct trolling
Just soft prodding
03because yay hvaing like 30k students
Then he boils himself over
:D
03so maybe if they go purging the database someday they'll be like "wait, what"
12XD
12I think he doesn't get jokes
They are funny trolls
03well actually I don't know
03I told them I was going to "take classes elsewhere for a while"
03I wonder when they'll start wondering
12which is a shame :<
03supposedly we hvae to surrender our student ID cards upon leaving the school
Meh :P
03if they bug me
03I'll be like
03"I lost it"
Hes a fucking idiot
03so what? i'll buy a new one for w/e fee
03because then I can still use that one to get into football games LOL
Good jorb
<Xanbreon> They are funny trolls <- I personally disagree but I guess my standards are rather odd. Trolling must be rather exceptional for me to find it anything but severely stupid :p
/me roll roll
03not that I give a crap about football, but my sister is in the marching band so we go to a couple games each year
03and yay student passes :P
My opinion may be coloured by my dislike of the target
;)
And also the effectiveness against said target
As long as it's purple
p-p-p-purrpleee
03anyway
03Xanbreon, ever ran into a problem with DBAN where it'll give a crap ton of "unable to read sector" errors and then just not boot? It's not the disc, I burned it a few times and it reads fine in ImgBurn
03but it just won't boot on a couple machines i have
03I had to make it into a flash drive version but the problem is I don't want to nuke my flash drive and/or tie it up for a few hours while it's going
/me wonders
drf, never used DBAN tbh
Might be the drive if its more than one disc
03you got another tool for erasing hard drives?
03did it on two drives too
03as in
03I replaced the DVD-ROm drive with a DVD+RW drive
03and it still did it
03I'd suspect the BIOS but it can boot Windows installation discs just fine so I dunno what else it would be
12oh
The first @hoho is part of the hostmasking
12k
Erm, I normally just use gparted
I dont see the need to wipe drives unless im getting rid of them
You are just adding uneeded wear and tear if you do a full wipe otherwise
I think the 2nd part is related to the IP address, and the last part is the rDNS on the IP
Or part of it
03I *am* getting rid of them
03:P
03it's those crappy 40GB SCSI drives
03that I want to toss
03but they belonged to the company I work for, so I wanna make sure the data is actually gone
03etc
Hit them with a hammer
03and since they're SCSI I can't just toss them in anotherg machine
03-g
03well
03That MIGHT work but LOL I'm paranoid and suc
03*such
03actually what might work
03ONE of the two IBMs wwas able to boot DBAN
03the other didn't
03so tI could just swap the drives
03I still don't quite understand why
Or plug them all into one
03they're identical machines
Diff bios revision?
03I dunno how SCSI works, that might take some tomfoolery in the bios
03nope
03I flashed them both
Cable bugs
03at the same time
03to the newest one
03cable bugs?
Iffy cables
03again, I can use Windows XP discs just fine
I dont know, computers do these things
03and those computers are old and can't boot flash drives
03so :"/
03*:/
03actually you know what I'll try
03is xboot
SCSI should just be plug and pray
03I use it to make flash drives
03but it can make burnable ISOs too
03and it uses GRUB bootloader to launch the crap
03out of curiosity, is it possible to mount a hard drive doing ISO emulation but do it readonly so a nuke won't wipe it?
03I was thinking of turning one of these old crap machines into a nuking station where I can just mount drives and wipe them
03without needing to continually use the CD
03I could always boot from an SD card and switch the lock on, trolol
Hurrhm
03I know there's CF to IDE
03does CF have locking though?
I dont know if DBAN will care about stuff mounted as readonly
03it searches for all drives
4: $50 nzd itunes card for $40 nzd
03hence why if I use a flash drive, it wipes the flash drive LOL
want?
03um
03not sure if there's anything useful in NZD store
03well lemme try making an xboot ISO, that might do it
there we go.
03One of these computers has flaky RAM, not sure if it's the stick or the motherboard, so I might just toss it :/
03loud fans, broken GPU, honestly no point in fixing it up
actually one sec.
03the other one works fine sans the GPU so I shoved a $30 5500 in there
mIRC is glitching x___x
Theres not much point fixing them up anyway tbh :P
Hurrhm
03just to have?
I think SD card with hardware lock on is the best bet
03enterprise computers are slightly lulzy
03hm, k
03CF doesn't have any sort of lock?
03because CF -> IDE means less screwing around XD
Shame
that's a regged nickname
I'd rather not
12:<
even he isnt THAT stupid
Not as far as I know
12you're sure it's a he?
The lock is due to the S in SD
;)
idk.
03oh is it?
well
and idc to be fair.
a whole lot more open than xD
03yeah
Wellll, night
~
03my dad's old camera used xD and it was fairly annoying
12night Espeon
It is called Secure Digital afterall
02*WB03(Kyu03)02WB* - <Kyu> 07you all suck XD
Thankfully xD died
03my camera uses Memory Stick (not duo, just the regular one), so I just turned two MicroSD into one
Night <3
</missed>
:(
03I mean, I suppose I could use a USB SD card reader, mount it as internal USB and set the BIOS to always boot from S
03*USB

03Reminds me of a funny picture
03"We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool"
03and the caption was like "I don't mind if you swim in my toilet" XD
gross, but SO true

03LMAO what
03how does that work?
12hurr

03geeks unite
^5
12LOL
03I'd spend class programming the material into my calculator instead of paying attention XD
I used to spend maths class doing the same kinda stuff

Also you could get kickarse games for the TI84+SE
03yep
03TI83+ SE here
03but same thing
I forget what it was called
0384 is stupid
03Mirage OS?
03I got a reputation for having awesome calculator games
03and would give them to people
03XD
Didnt have that :P
03some of my friends were like "dude, you could make so much money if you sold the games to people" but EW SELLING FREE SOFTWARE
03All I did was just download it from ticalc.org and use the USB cable >_>

moar qq
03it's just like the regular one but beta?
^
03also DBAN works when I load it via XBOOT
03So I dunno what was wrong before
03but nuking the 80GB SATA drive first in the yHP
03-y
Weird
03I have a 250GB SATA that was collecting dust
03so why not?
03free upgrade xD

Kewl
why do i even bother with IRC anymore...
I dont know, why do you?
03Haha this episode of Family Guy
03I love this one
Horrid stickmissmatching on the ram
:(
03well;
03I had the 2GBs in my room
03the 1GBs came iwth it
03what else do I do
036GB > 4
03and it boots up fine so eh
The 2gig sticks are diff oems
ikki
03...
03LMAO
03see
03those were actually in my dad's computer
03he bought a OEM computer
03the motherboard died so I salvaged the RAM
03Go blame THEM LOL
Boreeee
I will do!
03I actually didn't look at the labels, I assumed they matched
OEMs do stupid things to
03yeah
03ironically it was a PowerSpec
03PowerSpec is pretty legit
Never even heard of them
03exactly
03it's Micro Center's OEM brand
03they're a smallish store
03that's *actually good* unlike Best Buy
03not really bigbox no
03there's only like 30 of them nationwide
!Rukario
/me now belongs to Xanbreon for 11 minutes
Aaahh
nooooo'
http://pandaboard.org/content/platform
I would love one of those
03http://www.powerspec.com/
03a few of their computers are literally the same price as buying the raw parts by themselves
Thats a horrid website
03plus free support
03yeah
03it's a small business, what do you expect XD
Low/midrange pcs are generally not really worth building tbh
03exactgly
03-g
03my mom's was like $400
03from PowerSpec
As the build discount the oems gets counters out any buildityourself cheapness
03and nowadays I could build her one about twice as good for the same price
i'm doing linux homework
03since hers only has a dual core Pentium and like 4GB of RAM
03onbaord video
03and we added a 9400GT
Generally building your own is only really needed for highend or if you have very spesific needs
03yeah
03my dad's PowerSpec was like $600 and has a core 2 quad
*specific
03originally had DDR2 but when the board fried he got a new one and that used DDR3
03so I had the RAM sticks as spares
A computer kinda like mine would have been £1500 ish
gah
I spent err
college why do you do this to me
stop sending me this stuff x-x
it does not make me feel safe
£1093
But the oem computer doesnt have a SSD, but it has a GTX580 vs a GTX570
wargh
sigh.
And the problem is that I would have to have opened them up and buggered around to get the SSD ect in
/me hides
nahahaaa

03so Xanbreon, you know the options that show up when you hold Power on the phone? Is that part of the framework or can you add stuff?
drf, its called the power menu, its part of the framework
12lmfao
03darn it
03so I can't add an entry?
There are Advanced power menu mods
03hmm
what's going on now?
But generally that means flashing a custom deodexed rom
03requires root obviously?
03well
03I ask because CyanogenMod has a "screenshot" option built into the power menu
03I wanted to add something ismilar using any random screenshot progrma
03*program
sigh you dont wanna know.
12SS is being awesome
oh fuck off TwatSeas.
12:D
Thats a good one
No its not that easy
Hmm..
Normally it needs a deodexed rom
03why, why do the oxexes screw it up?
03*do
odex files are precompiled stuff for the dalvik VM
12http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/internet-memes-the-girl-who-does-nothing.jpg
If they dont match the file they are compiled from
Alright, seriously, stop it you guys
Then everything breaks
Aka if you make modifications to the apk, you always need to edit its odex file
Its generally system apps that are odexed
and the framework
While there are no rules, respect AND common sense is required

Adobe Flash is actually one of their positive points for Android
as is the open source nature
12Anyhow, you rally shouldn’t let such things bother you SS
like it or not Flash is still important in the web landscape today
i know
12really*
maybe you should try living a life of hell and see how you like it
03so what do you suggest for taking screenshots easily?
get back to me when you do.
03well
03is there a way to like, make a hotkey
03say power and volume?
03similar to iPhones
12by no means is my life good LOL
/me gets back to you
HAI
I recall seeing one in Android 3.2
03I saw one program that will map itself to the camera button, but my phone doesn't have a camera button :/
03just power and volume up/down
Find an app that can map itself to a button combo
03yeah but it needs to take screenshots derp
03and there's only a few I've even found
Or flash a custom rom
well im just really sick of being trolled at.
03most of them require you to shake the phone or put some stupid overlay on top of everything
nobody wants to RTS a bit? :|
or being used for someone else's stupid games.
er
*TBS
fuck RTS I suck at that
Thats a shame, but your input lag is pretty bad
03also can you find me a custom ROM for the Droid 4 that *actually works*? :P
03since all the ones I've seen are experimental and buggy
03so yeah
Go read up on XDA, they have stock based custom roms
Might even had a mod you want
Or even rootzwiki
12SS, someone can only be trolled if they let themselves be trolled
03that site's a bit tl;dr though :/
I want a android pokemon ROM
:P
12I just think it's funny when someone tries to troll me, you should do the same
Not really, just hit the dev section, spend a bit of time reading
You can break locked bootloaders phones pretty easy, thus you should spend some time reading about what your doing
12Because honestly, I don’t take very many people I meet online seriously.
..so nobody wants to play a game with me?
03well
03I have safestrap
03hoewve rthat works
/me plays the hunger games with Quilava
12:D
Dunno what that is
:|
03recovery thingy
03that lets you dualboot
im not like others
03the " safe" system won't be modified when the other one is messed with
im more sensitive when it comes to shit like that.
Ah cool
03so you can put a custom ROM on the safe system and not worry about bricking
03the only annoyhing thing
12but you don't even know these people that troll you?
03is that ROM Mangaer doesn't know what it is
03so I can't do scheduled backups
03I have to do it manually :/
I'll take that as a no.
/me idles
Yuck, sucky locked bootloaders
:/
03Droid 2 had a locked bootloader too and they hacked the vcrap out of it
03-v
12well, what game did you want to play?
fuck i lol'd
Yeh, motarolas gone a bit shovelware with the droids though
03I know :/
03it's good hardware, software is meh
03I deleted all the bloatware and put AdwLauncher so it's mostly fine now
Most dev support is going towards the Razer
or w.e
03for some reason
03it worked when I just deleted Maps as a system app and reinstalled it from the market as a regular app
03not sure why
Probs verizon borking junk
03well
http://a23.catastrophex.com/play.html this
03I flashed back to stock, only unisntalled the non-system bloatware (as in, didn't need root to do it), and it still broke
03it must be Adw's fault
03but LauncherPro crashed it too
03and there's no way to use the stock without removing all custom launchers
03so eh
Thats weird
12Unfortunately I’m not a member of catastrophex and lazy :<
03it is
Probs motarollas crap software
03prolly
too lazy to play the game, I suppose
03but I got it working now, no worries
03I just reinstalled it as a regular non-system app
12just too lazy to join
kewl
You can always just flash gaps
03all you need is the market
03literally all the rest are there
12might later though
so too lazy to play
I AM AFRAID I CANNOT DO THIS
Mhhm, depends where in the world you are
Theres other stuff, libs for gtalk with video and stuff
That you dont get on some phones
03oh
12how did SS end up with so many people doing that? Is it some kind of fad? XD
it's just to annoy him really
probably because they know it bugs him
http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Gapps#Gingerbread_.28Android_2.3.x.29
:|
One good page on rootzwiki
Rest is meh
03well I alreayd have the market/play app
03so it's not a big deal
Yeh
12SS, if someone really wanted that name, say with some numbers after it then would it be okay? derp
03so yeah any idea about the screenshot thing?
03as for the Razr, Droid 4 is basically the same thing but with a keyboard so some of those ROMs might work
Dont think so
Support chips are normally diff
03sigh, accent keys broke again, brb
03ó.ô
good jorb
03It's a windows glitch

can't get it working, probably bad sectors, can't even live boot/boot from USB
o-o
What, it wont boot from USB?
Or from cD?
yeah
gives the disk error
Thats pretty bad
10Sister came home talking about how her friend has iPhone 4 with Siri. The friend called Siri bad things and it responded with replies like, "Why do you think that?". My sister said she was creeped out and my mother is like, "Artificial intelligence! The Matrix isn't too far away!"
/me facepalms
Lawl
thats bad
10Xanmatrix
SkyAI
03oh sorry someone needed me?
10AI?
Artificial intelligence
Sirfail
10oh, right
03hm
sapping up data
wasting battery
:P
government laptop drf
it's quite crappy
blocks using exes
03go hack the government with that
10lolgovernment
03and just tell them it already had the credentials
03"oops"
03etc
though I can get around that using safe mode
bleh.
lmao
03anyway um
well it's the free laptop given to us by the government
03your laptop was running Linux? :P
10your school computers are governmental?
linux + windows
hah
03cuz the Linux stuff is probably gone
03I don't know of any ext3 recovery
damn
03but I hvae a nice FAT/NTFS recovery
well
how would that work?
03if you can just pry the drive out and attach it externally
Our School still uses WinXP
Errh
03Nothing wrong with XP
You can recover ext3 fine
03using what
and they use IE 8
http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-recovery/
etc
Tons of programs
03oh wait
03woah
03Diskinternals XD
03I have their Uneraser program
*nix based, windows based
blah blah
03but the one I usually use is called GetDataBack
Ah
03it's pretty nice
well
the thing is
03but it only works on FAT and NTFS
trying to live boot into linux via CD gives the same disk error
windows gives a black screen
USB just gets stuck loading the program/boot sector
You tried putting a distro on a USB stick?
03have you tried Parted Magic?
and not hitting the HDD at all
03but no, like I said, physiclaly take the hard drive out
03and mount it externally
it's the hard drive that IS the problem
03I don't think you're getting what I'm saying
03you have more than one computer, right?
03Take the hard drive out of computer 1
yeah
03attach it to the working one
03etc
and do what?
finally
last linux project
03and run data recovery
gah i hate this so much x-x
drf, the laptop the HDD is in works 100% fine
03unless you don't care about the data
but the hard drive doesn't
03so you don't want to recovery it?
03-y
i do want to
I need my linux files
o-o'
You need a working computer in order to pull files
I already have the windows one since I haven't modified it since a few weeks ago and I have a 2 week old backup
03I don't think you can recover the files without a working OS, and I don't know of any Linux-based recoveries
well
You also dont want to be running from the HDD when recovering
03oh, you want to boot into a live distro and see if you can just mount it?
Thus pull it and connect to another computer
I tried booting into a live distro
03yeah
03that's the best option, mounting it externally
doesn't work
inb4 put in fridge
well
Live distros used the HDD as cache
how would I do that?
03with a cable? LOL
I'd need a cable e.g SATA-USB or something
I don't have any
03yeah
03go steal one
/me hides
:U
it wont be sata
It will be err
The laptop version of PATA
firewire?
ah
03LMAO firewire
No
03Xanbreon you know what I saw that made me LOL a bit?
03USB monitors.
Smaller PATA(IDE)plug
urgh
03I kid you not
drf, they are a cool idea
03no VGA required
03USB only
that's lovely
03and they go up to 24"
03that's fricking bizarre
haha drf
03"My video card doesn't have a USB port, help"
You wont get fast 3D out of them though
:P
lmao
03you can't powre them through teh GPU?
well
ahme
03*power
No
USB 3 GO!
I'll see if I can get one
:D
NS, check your laptop model
Find a guide about how to remove the HDD
03LOL people bringing loaded guns into the pawn shop
As some.. yeh, are a HUGEE PAIN
03mine's stupidly easy since it's custom built
03you just take the two screws out and pop it out
Mhhm
03inf act I have one with Windows and one with Mac OSX, I can just swap the two
well taking the hard drive out is easy
just need to be careful not to damage that random connector orange cord thing
whatever you call that
and then attach the hard drive elsewhere
IDE cable
yeah that
03well
You will probs want a external USB enclosure
03first, is the idea just to see if you can copy the data off?
Though, tbh
Actually
yeah drf
I just want the data
If you have 1) a flash drive 2) a large external HDD (big enough to store all the data)
03have you tried Parted magic?
no need to salvage the stuff
nope
03try that
I've tried Hirens though
03it's about 150MB thogh
03*though
03the older ones are like 50
heh well
03but burn it to a CD
03and try it out
I'll see
technically USB would be better
but yeah
You could install a linux distro to the flash stick, then dump stuff to the external
03well
03get xboot
03are you on Windows right now?

why do all these Android screenshot apps have like a 2-3 second delay before the actual image is saved?
is that just an Android problem?
CM9 ss capture is instant
gah
wasn't for me
i hate this book so much
it's so far over my head
neither was CM7
it was still 2-3 seconds
Instant as in, basically 1s and most of that was animation
I mean it was just a delay
gave me time to open another app
It has to grab the visable stuff from each active window
As mobile GPUS improve stuff like this should work better
so on a 1.2GHz dualcore why would that take more than half a second?
I mean, ahem printscreen on 1080p
is instant

Theres stuff like AE for linux sure
but yeah
But mostly you can do what AE does with NFS shares, and login scripts
he told us to make one fix to the active directory structure for the scooby doo lab
You only need the bloated mess that is AE due to the registry
i so badly wanted to tell the teacher "Make a directory called "Scooby Doo's Worst Fears"

also... he can only access it from 12:00:00AM to 12:00:01AM
