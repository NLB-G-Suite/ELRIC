I grew up with TNG.
13we stream all kinds of things during the week
13ponies are usually when one of our streamers takes requests, or on movie night, the episode stream, and the encore show
Um, Voyager? It's a win, but, why?
00,107AU? that's rather large

12kps is speedy
130.05m/s is about 0.11mph
13that's like... less than slow walk
Yep

Star trek?

a hashtable might be faster as well
no experience with trees yet, doing this to learn a bit more about memory managment
meh, hastable would be a binary search anyway
hi
reaaally missing c++
turns out memory managment is easy, the problem i'm having is a pointer that goes nuts betwene functions
hi meh
same here
haha
do you aim with the wiimote?
hope not, that thing is jumpy
worked well enough in re4
i had a few different gun things for the wiimotes to go into that were pretty good for shooters
Back~

whistles are boring
with 2 whistles you can get to the last world from world 1 ~.~
10,02World 2 actually
there is a second whistle in level 3
lol
10,02Yes, but you need to be in World 2 in order to reach World 8
2 whistles?
really? i recall using a whistle in the whistle world
and got to world 8
watch "the wizards"
10,02Yeah, but using a whistle in World 1 brings you to select between world 1-3
10,02Using the Whistle in World 2 lets you select World 4-6
2 whistles at a time
and if you use a whistle again you land in world 8
10,02Then you can use it to go to World 8
10,024-7 I mean
yummy
10,02OMG DAT FAIL

07,01sweet dreams
:)
Where was I? Right. Spike and his powers
oh damn look at the time i need to go to school see you later everypony

bai
07,01have fun
thats 1 M.C. dont know how to pluralize word
x__x
07,01Well dear ponies i'm gonna Lurk for a bit, i'll be back later!
have fun
Have fun lurking Luna
Cya
07,01Lulu = lurky luna
No answers on how Spike could burn ponies alive?
lol
lol @ 'accident'
Not much? Derpy prooved that ponies, when set ablaze, do not burn up or something.
just blacken
Hm, alrighty then
dat logic
Sooo... how's about them canon?
specify
I still accept both names as canon
^
though that being said, i didn't particularly like the use of a "slow" voice for her
she's a clutz, not "slow"
Frankly they could have handled Derpy a LOT worse
wut?
Oh..
as long as they don't spotlight her every episode now I'll be good
Also, Dash doesn't seem to like Derpy
give her a voice more similar to the one used in the various Dr. Whooves/Ditzy radio plays
well dash's annoyance was justified
Family Matters FTW
lol :D
I'm sure she's much more capable just not as willing to show it off
(\LunaTheBeloved
She's going to develop some nice skills in Transformation
Or mindswapping
Both are good for plo-storylines
a mindswap episode could be hillarious
true...I can dream though...or write fan-fiction
Transfiguration is still open right?
and on her parents
yeah, but that was magic diahrrea
it doesn't exactly count
Just sayin'
:D
Or just RD becoming an Earth pony. Because that plo-storyline went nowhere fast
I would kill to see that
well there is that one fic where dash's wings get grafted onto Applejack
We're also forgetting another Magical unicorn
huhwut?
/me sends Trixie BACK to china
no we arent <_<
rarity?
Yes Rarity
I can't see Rarity becoming too to upset with anything of that sort
rarity losing her unicorn magic? she would flip
She has no prior magic abilities!
Unicorn is a status symbol to her, for one thing, and she wouldn't be able to make her dresses
I...guess
I dunno I just can't see it
Or we could always hope the CMC accidentally release another horrible monster unto the land
lol
they release the G3 ponies
ohgono
ohgodno
"You fools! You've messed up the natural ORDAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
we need catpeople though , diamonddogs are meh
/me runs and hides
exactly they could do pretty much anything with her
:D
that's "Appletini," like the drink
lol much more obscure refrence
i never would've known about the alcohol reference in Applejack if someone hadn't mentioned it
was it pony?
/me stares at guitar
you not pony
character development
bad brain, bad!
/me shudders
I mean, is he a quiet intellegent individual?
DoNT READ IT
^
Is he just a Muscular man with common sense?
i believe he's a Forrest Gump
Magic is as magic does....
HMD i dont know wat ur talkin about
wat fic?
The Pinkie Pie one
Spiderses
?sekacpuc
Yes
/me shudders
dat logic
depends - pigtails Cherilee or show Cherilee
^
Hot , you saw the hat she gave spike , now imagine her wearing that
that mare knows where its at
she has style
but I'm not convinced
words i never want to say again ^
words I'll probably end up saying
she's teaching pony kindergard... is that kindergarden there?
nah its school
yes, but it's all a matter of perspective
was DT being smiteful or playful?
around 4th grade maybe
"scolding"
where maybve 10% of the teachers ever recognize bullying, and they're never the ones you're being taught by
I prefer my canadian one thank you very much
At least Granny Smith has being senile to blame for being ignorant on such things
i believe the thought is "When you're this old, you just don't give a damn anymore"
#1 - at least he had the decency to say that in my own home, though it was still mortifying to me
and #2 - that implies a "when," rather than an "if"
but moving on...
Did something happen for them to think bullying was a good idea or is it just
for DT, it's the standard rich-child entitledness
possibly a homelife thing
exactly
For being Popular they only seem to have each other to deal with
most of the time
we on't even have a proper understanding of their economy
we know enough about it that it works on a typical capitalist system
I mean, the only reason I say that is because they do not seem to interact with ponies other than themselves, the CMC, and Twist
I mean high quality gemstones are a common happenstance
And the latter two were to bully them
gemstones aren't at the same level of "value" as they are IRL, though they're still a status item in a way
also pearls arent gems , and while gems are abundant , pearls come from shells
cannon?
yes
He seemed more... In control to me
canon*
hmmmmm
i don't recall which episode that was, but we do hear them call them "bits"
very informative thank you
MI:they r bits. pinkie owes me 500 bits
definately in the best night ever , when rarity and BB order something to eat , that'll be 4 bits
He was not prepared for such a possibility to show up and backfire
most of wat i remember is getting kicked off stage
then i passed out :D
yeah and apparently there is no need for dentistry
Possibly

nopony's streaming
oh
well that makes sense lol
4 now
perhaps a cultural difference or regional
well zebras are a bit of an "african" / tribal stereotype as portrayed
at first I thought you meant 4 people weren't streaming now
lol
BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBNBABANBNABABNBAABNANBANABABNBANBAANBANBABAN
suddenly, Dari
it was just a joke
:D
:3
Why did she set up shop there?
o.o Scary Dari.
closer to ingrediants she would more often need
perhaps back in whereve she came from she lived in a place much like it
by the way how did you do that emote
: D
probably a bit of that too - though civilization does have a habit of destroying the natural plants in the given area

Ola Senior

buenos dias!
/me has exhausted his grasp of spanish
aaaaaaa spanish :P
Que?
I heard that the hub adopted the title
well it's certainly easier to refer to a pony by name than as "Background_Pony1234"
Uh, yes? lolidunno
not neccesarily
also why is nopony streaming
/me sad
yes all the win
Te amo
speak in english
english is the only language I understand
yes, he probably is
Do you understand english
yes
lol

wat
where is the bathroom?
i could've sworn someone mentioned that he was asked back in April
IDK I though it was just a rumor
:O
^
Estoy triste.
and again wit dat spanish
I mean, he did a guest spot on Transformers I don't see why not
:'(
lol timing
brb gotta let my dogs in
awwwww
lawl
:D
don't be sad here have a rainbow dash

i might get kicked for this but Micheal Vick

hello!
my...question....
Cello!
Te amo
<3
is the stream streaming?
nopie dopey
i don't think there's a stream, no
sorry my lappy crashed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY&list=LLt7r1FRquoyxbJ1xbCw2ytw&index=2&feature=plpp_video
I'm not a betting man
hey
:(
literally all I have is the title.
drop it!
Typist
communist
:D
anyway, I just anted to say high before I went to catch the bus. also, for anyone lurking: READ THIS: http://lossthief.deviantart.com/art/Mod3rator-281057533
Do you think we'll ever get a Celestia episode?
*hi
doubtful
I mean, we know little more about her than we did earlier in the series
hi
I wouldn't classify it as such
but yea
Chickens are birds.
platypus=bird :D
It's not complicated!
lol
why is stream not working?
k
cuz the mods have school/day jobs
"I was promised a creature wtih impossible Biology, with poisonous claws and fire-breathing!"
and lives
except dari
I have school...
Isn't he a kidder?
I have accepted my no-life and acquired ponies
wouldn't you want a pet aligator?
To me he just looks like a derp
Of nature
Perhaps because of the unconventional nature of an alligator being a pet
i live in florida
i see gators often
as pets?
Something that would have died had Pinkie Pie not come out of no where and took him
i wouldnt be surprised if a had a dozen gators within a mile of me right now
ive carried a 5 footer over my shoulder once
he has no teeth
lol
gummys 1 right?
and doesn't he kind of already do that?
gators dont try to eat EERYTHING
Eat ponies in one bite
lol
When they are hungry they hunt
nope.avi
scavange
It is not quantom physics
Alright, Opal. It's a cat, it does cat things. We have nothing else to talk about there
thats why he has no teeth, pinkie gives him too much sugar
lol
Same for Tank and Owlu-wtf is his name
I guess*
Pinkie riding gator is win
I'm calling him Hooter from now on
Because it's funnier
lawl
it sure is
buenos dias!
He's a tortiose. He sits around and eats leaves
Tank probably just chills around RD's house.
:3
It's not like we're talking this huge anaconda or a smill child
i imagine he's got some kind of enchanted accessory that allows for cloudwalk
probably a collar or something
I just realized how purposterous this conversation is :D
We're nerds!
If weren't talking Ponies, we'd be talking Star Trek
I be aninerd
I out of loop 4 star trek
^
It was full of colorful chartoon charactors with animal features
name?
Oh dear.
I gothya
And they blow it off like it's normal
wtf?
wat http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/117127
How anthro are they? They might have assumed it was a skeleton of an anthro minus some distinguisng characteristics
distinguishing*
OHGODNOO
seriously
Pikmin 2
The thing was twice the height of them and they dismissed it!
When I see something human-esque in a world of non-human creatures and they ignore it it just disturbs me
13morning ponies~
13thanks~
well afternoon to me
It would be pretty jarring to me
they have magic the all encompassing non-answer
human* ...me and these typos today...
man I've been logged on for like ever!
and now, for a dash of politics
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/supreme-court-holds-warrantless-gps-tracking-unconstitutional.ars some faith in humanity has been restored
/me pops her back
/me 8,1evaporates
8,1evenin' Fleur
Thank goodness, there's an honest-to-god bottom to this madness.
hello
8,1how's tricks?
8,1how are you?
8,1how's it hanging?
8,1what, as the say, is up?
ooohhhh
its kinda dangling a little to the left
yea
8,1john watson is best soldier
8,1just like rainbow dash
8,1Fleur: simple solution: plane trip to scotland
The two seem to have an odd obsession with being the best
8,1pinkieshy is cutest shipping
She doesnt care about being the best.
Fleur: it isn't that she has an issue coping with it, but more along the lines of facing the consequences
Fleur !!! :3
/me sits on a couch eating brownies
I have something awesome to tell you :3
She said she'll do something, and the issue was "Oh crap, I can't do X"
8,1rarilight is most interesting shipping
she doesnt have issues facing consequences. She /prommised/ to bring back money to fix the building.
She doesnt like breaking her prommises
Alright, Pinkie Pie. She breaks the moment nopony shows up for her parties
Rarity has maybe embodied her element without prompting, once. "Suited for Success".
she loves competition
fair competition.
but if she didn't win any prize money...
Every other time, she has to get embarrassed first, then acts as a good friend.
before she left she said she would bring back the money to fix the roof
Hence why she got her part-time job
she didnt say where the money had to come from
Pinkie pie breakdowns are hard as her persona is somewhat stochastic
exactly. She isnt ashamed of failure. She is ashamed of breaking prommises
she seemed ashamed too me at the end of the episode
Now, back at the farm she was most likely ignored a majority of the time for work
lol
But that's not generosity. I think Rarity is AWESOME. But all we ever see is her being a stuck-up user.
she is a narc
that made me sad
I have an exam in a few hours and here I am discussing ponies mental issues
Fleur: that was a fanon interpretation way back in the beginning
I'm sure she has freinds
that moving service could have been a temp job
^
based on how much she dropped, i'm sure it was at that point
I think despite the rough edges she probably has a good relationship with RD
inb4 she turns out to be RD's sister
I'm sure there were already plenty of fanfics before that
*How
lol
hmmm
it's doing well
2 bits for an apple fritter
no
Not very good at crafting are they?
lawl
that might make it hard to cook
and magic
which would make it easier
Hat becomes metal
Fleur: All I want is to see Rarity do something genuinely selfless, is all.
prove it
"...Maybe"
she did when she made those dresses for the mane6
The dresses in the first season was Selfless, yes.
Ok I can get that
72 weapons=1 hat
Ok no
Should shako for two refined!
She hasn't done anything like that in 20 eps or more.
stinko you shoulda tried WoW
Stout shako even
Get metal
Make hat
Being acquisitive is fine -I mean, you can't give to others if you have NOTHING.
Simple!
yes
you have a wide selection
^
in order to be Generous, one must also be equally Greedy
I know they have armor but I didnt know you could make hats
Despite my distaste for her attitude most of the time I can't bring myself to genuinely dislike dear Rarity
I believe she IS generous, but she just wants her time in the spotlight
Dear.
Rarity is like that woman from the shop in The Room
You can't hate her no matter how hard you try
I can
but I dont want to try <3
speaking of why can't Rarity just move to canterlot...I sence another good quality about her
because of her friends
Pinkie Pie to be perfectly honest, scares me
she cant because she doesnt make enough to move there yet. Aslo, yes. her friends
She just seems clingy
Fluttershy a wimp? pshhhaw
right
Fleur: I know :D
Fluttershy is stronger, mentally, than any of the other ponies
Whenever she wants
and yet somehow weaker
You cant break her.
Pshyically, she's made of cardboard.
not really
Ha ha ha
not necessarily...
I know Rondomnerd just toying with ya
All ponies are bad, no ponies are good.
but Fluttershy is mentally weak enough that he can just affect her by default
rather, Fluttershy *was*
Frankly it just seems that Pinkie Pie would be the pony that would be staring at me from my ceiling when I wake up
His rage gave him sufficient focus.
Anywho, have some Pie sisters to show I am not a bad person. http://i40.tinypic.com/i6a3v7.png
She's just unnerving
break their resolve by hitting their element, then cast Mind Control
not too many ponies are that poor natured
excluding NM
I would say including NM
/me hides in a corner
NM was a main villain, that's why I excluded her
I loved when she said that <3
Like Misery
"We'll have a party!"
/me sledgehammer
"Forever!"
......
...?
O.O
I need to watch the inception pinkie now
>.>
<.<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWBbf2B9ELU&feature=fvst
it's like reading a b-movie...
It /is/ reading a b-movie
yeah I fucked up there thanks for the correction
/me has yet to see a single horror movie that was actually scarry
...i'm tolerating the crap out of those comments about my favorite horror genre related books
This is getting kind of silly.
Liked "On Writing".
brb
I just don't like her. I don't hate her but the show just needs to be focused on someone other than her for me to enjoy her
^
which is why I tolerate and silently lament no worries :D
Too much Pinkie Pie is bad for me
Alright guys, I'm gonna go grab lunch
Catch y'all laterz
anjoy the munch
*enjoy
Anyway, I personally dont find horror scarry. The only time I ever get scared while watching a horror movie is "jump scares" and that shit is not horror, its just fucking annoying and proves that you are a failure as a writer if you have to resort to that.
Now that I have gotten out why Pinkie Pie terrifies me
And then a skeleton popped out!
Let's move on to another pony
The other thing is that we see the evil counterparts of most of the ponies.
fleur*
yes
Evil counterparts?
Puppets - Daniel Heicht
it's not the story that's scary, but the concept
Their negative traits turned up to 11.
Pinkie's gunna get a negative counterpart soon enough.
There's no negative Fluttershy, yet.
how could you make a negative fluttershy?
So....BlueBlood?
seriously that wouldn't be exactly evil
Well, not the opposite (Humorless), I mean all of RD's bad traits writ large
It may or may not be.
^
I heard about this, but thought it was a joke
I find the sheer AMOUNT of ponies in Equestria interesting
why?
you're imagination is the limit
exactly
^
or a timelord....
While another can be a woman dealing with Marriage issues!
Loyalty is the option to help and generaly taking it.
It's an endless stream of possibilities!
Spice Mehreeen!
SPHESS MUREENS!!!
U Got yerself a FRIEND, SPICE MEHREEN?
We're talking about Spice mahrines now, apprently.

About the Ponies.
Kicks mcgee and....
Is Equestria one country of many? Are there other nations of ponies?
aw I should know this!
Of course. Photo Finish comes from Germaney. Shapprie Shores comes from Neighpon.
not sure... we did see a whole globe at one point
There's evidently a place for Gryphons, and the Buffalo are a sovereign people.
plenty of world building there
inb4 Draconia
Dragons aren't cohesive enough to form a country.
And there's Stalliongrad, ruled by Valdmare Putin.

I might do that, but no one would understand :(
No one understands. No one knows my plan.
not sure if sarcastic...
13they might be giants?
Oh, wow.
I know them, don't like them
whats that coming over the hill is it a pony?
13but no i don't really know them .-.
and I made that clear to them
13just particle man and maybe something else
wait no, wrong band
My friends think I'm weird for liking them.
triangle man
But then again, my friends think I'm weird anyway.
I wouldn't want it otherwise.
I'm closeted
admittedly I am too
Fleur, because I go to an all boys secondary school in the UK
Kammer, I'm dependant on keeping things on the downlow because of work...
My friends think I'm weird, but they're cool with it.
that should be an adequate answer
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m480ZuwkkYU
this is adorable
if they have a problem with it... you probably won't be good friends
Saturn!
certainly!
Fleur, because I'm going to get the shit torn out of me by everyone
8,1<333
<3
:> <3
mfw Saturn is speaking in Shy colours
friends come and go, you'll learn that in a few years
8,1i'm keeping them warm for her.
Fleur, the kind of are...
Maybe Saturn IS Shy.
*they
OMG soo cute hnnnnggggg
and then Saturn was Shy
8,1have you ever seen us in the same room at the same time?
/me seizure
Saturn =/= Shy
I hate when someone pretends to be my friend, then backstabs me.
oh well
Saturn, I've seen you two in the same skype group at the same time
and skype call for that matter...
With more potential than the very foundations of the Earth!
8,1ScootaChicken: voice changer and 2 laptop
omai
and then Saturn was a Shy
Saturn I know for a fact that you are not Shy
05so
oh...my...
05i heard you were streamless?
/me noms pocky
/me 8,1has a flutteryellow
Are we streamless?
I wouldn't know.

8,1if shy comes back, i've promised her i'll reliquish her colours
05hope you'll enjoy
/me jumps off clif

It's really weird without two screens.

NO

Guitar is still my mane
/me cant listen atm :(
I just realised my screen is dirty
it gives a whole "lone at the range" feels
playing bass helped way more than I thought it would...
Bass is my third
I want Wreks skizzlez
I only play bass, mandolin and guitar
although now that I have a 12 string mandolin has become somewhat redundant
I'm learning harmonica atm
lol awesome
Fleur: Now that's interesting! :3
triangle players unite!
banjo = best stringed instrument (after violin ofcourse)
Fleur banjo is easy if you're hyper
or drunk

I think this is fun
all the ponies in this room are crazy

then it's win
07,01WHO was looking for ME?

yeah... we r trying to guess the pony
---------->
this is awesome music
only pinkie pie would stare at the sun

0,14eeyup
0,14There was "The Ultimate Gamer" sponsored by WCG

do you mean E-sports?
13es ist not R63~
0,14I saw both seasons of TGU, and my qualm about it was that it focused more on the drama and personal lives of the gamers

Just saying
13pink text
Seriously...
unless openly stated
thats tv people want to see?
dat text
Shizuka's a girl name?
everything is a girls name
although actually thats probably hypocrisy, given that if I ever become a mod I'll probably use purple text
lol... they think WE are weird... watching a show that has a good plot, amazing character development, entertaining, and has good morals?
I just thought it was a very effeminate male
