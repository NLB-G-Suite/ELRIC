MOvie/ What movie? I didn't see no movie. Nope. Not at all. That's my story and I'm sticking with it.

00,10nice lock
DeadlyDerp3: well, don't go that far

i dont get it
Avatar vs Young Justice.
ummm
there was an non animated movie, it was just horrible
He's got to clear bleak falls now, right?
hard one
lol
cake
Kill some draugr?
00,10clearly you are mestaken ScootalooWonderloo
13don't you love how high fantasy settings can still have such complex doors and stuff like that
Awesome lock
Shizuka: yep.
can i link u Sumica?
Sumica there was though
Well, cause only the worthy can go in :P
inb4 flashback
Young Justice is over a year old yet it only has like 16 episodes.
I hear there's a book out there entirely devoted to descriptions of clever doors and how to open them.
13quest complete! quest started! >watch avatar roku's cutscene
eeyup
00,10nah that was't an avatar movie that was a pariody, shamalon thought he was being funy
look Aang
Roku
Everything was in pastels, it was a better time.
indeed
nope chuck testa
13ah this ep
and Sozen is Ron Pearlman
no really thats aang
War, war never changes
Sumica: can i link you to the wiki?
Quadrenaro: it's Aang's past life
season unending
dat party
A pARTY!
yay
dat yay
Bring the party Cannon!
it gets better. think about that
00,10what about the movie that never happend, nah that's ok
I think i'm seeing the chat before i see the video?
Well, Whoops
13roku just got promoted to mod
Happy birthday
what a tweeeeeeeest
13now he will feel out of place with regulars like sozin
Cue more ANGST
yeah
And The Last Airbender was a success having everyone ask if it would be the next Harry Potter franchise.
here's a question: what if a member of a nation's royalty was the Avatar?
lol
this is an excelent episode
lol
RAWRity: doesn't matter, goes beyond that.
Well, The world is more important than a nation's royalty
13probably line of succession
yeah
What they really said "I'm stealing your things, bitch. later"
13avatar goes off to destiny, whoever would have taken over if he died ascends
thus, Roku's head piece is explained
13geez aang..
00,10wtf aang
what
dat fart
lol
well timed trombone
lol
...Sokka knows, He went there
dat face
yes he did
He sat on a Spike L:O!
he is sitting on a dragno spine...
yeah, he met Giattso
otakon: yes but, it would still create a conflict of interest. How can you be totally dedicated to balance when the first 16 years of your life was focused on leading 1 nation.
as a kid
Sokka. If Avatar had jeapodary, he'd be a billionaire.
00,10dat music
lol
RAWRity: that's why they take the avatar AWAY from that for training
Never thought of it knows the name...
13why can't you believe it aang...
13gyatso would have been old enough..
well
Whoah
?
Shizuka: because it's still a bit of a shock to see you were friends with your teacher in a past life.
dat destruction
13i guess
nope.avi
it's a bit of a coincidence.
He's consistently reincarnated.
00,10the spirt of the avatar is
bugeyes8: no, but people especially Benders can live a LONG time
Roku lived for 200 years
ok, that makes sense.
not Bumi
13dat theme
bumi's too young. I know
Tovler: Bumi was a kid when Aang was
00,10showoff
kyoshi lived 300 or 400?
dat music
Tovler: that'd be weird, seeing as Bumi is younger than Aang
the results were channel owner
qwop
well
ULTIMATE POWER :[
hmmm
13sozin's VA sounds like keith david
oh snap
Daw
XD
Quadrenaro: 260
Shizuka: it's Ron Perlman
11,14off to bed for me, have a good night everypony :)

and fire
We should bring peace and democracy to Iraq
lol
and firey swords.
00,10and thus the friendship broke up
yeah

bugeyes8: no posting of unofficial channels
I'm guessing the lag is burning up the video
....
Sorry, i didn't think it would format like that
nope
otakon that was a hashtag reffrace
Dat face of seriousness
and every one knows it
dat Avatar State
HE IS RED TORNADO!
its okay just dont do it again
yeah
00,10srs threat
Okay hold on
Lolbai
dat end
dat srs threat
yay?
kthxbai
Guys going to bed
pokemon island?
and then Sozin called for the Royal Diaper Changer
Night derp
Aang wasn't born until AFTER Roku's death right?
good night
otakon: right
Hmmm
Say you'll keep your eye on soem one ignore for 25 years...
maybe he didn't live for 200 years
I must be thinking of someone else
he can do fus ro dah with out saying it O-O
otakon: oh, he didn't. Kyoshi lived for 260 though.
oh yeah
I thought it was like elves, can't age to death, can olny be killed by weapons and the like
still, he was like 90 when he died
bugeyes8: no, they can die of old age. But they age rather gracefully.
I'm way down on my lore of things.
bugeyes8: no, but benders it seems and especially the Avatar can live for a very long time
Old people still kick ass in this universe
Avatars are human. Just special in their power-- but in the end, human.
inb4 standoff with volcano
Come at me bro!
13hey they stole this plan from Volcano
Bumi:110+ and STILL spry
also, the life of an Avatar tends to cut down your life expectancy enough that you generaly die at a normal age.
don't click that
damn it
Whats up?
Volcano wins
FUSRODAH
Fus ro dah
Jinx
13Volcano is not amused >:I
for instance: Aang aparantly dies in his late 60's.
RAWRity: that only happened to Aang because of his burn up from the Avatar State and being frozen
Avatar state
13poisonous gases... godly airbender... just bend a bubble
aw shit
eeyup
10,02Volcano...wasn't that the movie where a bunch of lava started seaping into a city?
And that weird grinning dragon
"Oh. right. that second one."
he's drawing the heat away
"You know, maybe living on a god damn Volcano wasn't the best of ideas."
10,02All you need is Volcano insurance
petition to restart the Avatar movie franchise?
lol
i coughed with him
Fail
lolnope you can die here
Tovler: only if it's an original story, and not just the 1st Season condensed.
this is why fire kingdom is so powerful, they all cashed insureance with this accident
also, it must be animated.
yeah
what a tweeeeeeest
Dat pupil
yeah
AANG!!! d'awwwwwww
and then Aang was born shortly afterwards
dat Fang :'(
00,10the moment of death of one sees the birth of another
Kind of like the Dalai Lama.
but they didn't know he was the Avatar until 10 years
noooo1!!!!!!
yeah
fail
otakon: no, they knew he was the avatar when he was little, but didn't tell him til he was 12.
thus the title of the show
dat title drop
RAWRity: true actually
uhp. He said it!
That a crappy name zuko!
roku!!
yeah
inb4 tweeeeeest
lolz
trolololol
MAN, what a coincidence!
because im a troll
Ozai married Roku's kid
Swag bending is too much
otakon: he married Roku's grandkid
um
damn your right again
he is jesus
Zuko, you are....a Fire Born
*yoink*
^
lol
there are two The-ones?
Iroh is great
poopy pants boy
gotta say, the guy that replaced Mako did a damn good job.

MAGIC
RAWRity: he did
its magic
lol

it can't be easy to try and fill those shoes, but he came damn close.
lol
and then they four wayed
awww
who will be the new Toph?
<3
friendship is tragic
Fuck your science, Sokka!
And then they banged

Tovler: Toph's daughter, obviously.

10,02Night bugeyes8!
night bugeyes8
looks like one of those 'natural remedy' kinda scam things. it'd be interesting to read about the actual effects
163 pages crawled ~700 to go
that was a very elaborate 'kick me' sign
10,02Well, that will be the main focus of the topic, prove if it does have any actual health benefits
10,02See if the bacteria might produce some molecule that helps the human body out
10,02Or whatever to be honest
I'm off to bed
good night everyone

i was in another tab and was like wtf is that janeway?!
10,02Except I doubt we can source Wiki for all of our research :P
10,02We'll need to do lab cultures ourselves and produce some evidence.
Well... out for now, have fun watching whatever comes up.
Wiki is an invaluable resource for much research!

Phase4|Wine: dinging myself, seem to have lost mirc
that didnt work
I can haz chocolate cupcakes?
00,10Btw SB you dont have to say stream is up with Mips, it auto plays forever
wine doesnt taste like piss though
multiple desktops are awesome, makes working ALOT easier, but theres a tendencie to lose windows
10,02Just wanted to say it in case somepony isn't watching the stream...
No one gives me chocolate cupcakes ;A;
what is this?
/me gives Simon2 a cupcake
Gmorning everypony :3

00,10Through the eyes, why you no update
mirc died, that sucks
Sumica: ikr :'(
00,10I am gonna have to reread old chapteres next time it updates just to remember what's going on.
00,10So many fics i like never updating,.
turns out emoticons in mirc are less than trivial, i'l set that aside for another day
COnfounded ponies, I need colored pencils.
Sumica this is why I read finished fics
/me is realy looking forward to 'School Daze'
Ohai Dashie~
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/2432/School-Daze << have some cheerilee
ah, this game
10,02Call of Duty Black Ops ^_^
00,10I tryed that Dumori but then i ran out of ones that lookd intersting
Oh o_o
/me has no interest in this game
^
10,02;____;
Although I'm not completely anti-shooter like Phase4...
00,10fps suck with out a mounse
i'm not 'anti shooter', there free to exist and suck. but they should do so far away from me and not shove every other genre off the market
Wow Sumica. dat comic o__o
sorry @_@ I'm tearing up my house for colored items I can color with
00,10oh Feh Rawritys story thing wont load on my phone
This brushie dash does no justice with no color
>:(
:O
Sumica I still recall the heady days of keyboardlook FPSs
Don't you have markers somewhere?
btw, try type part of a name and press tab
00,10Yeah I played doom multyplayer in the mac lab back in highshchool
I found a red colored pencil, a blue high lighter..
now I need something orange and a yellow highlighter
Phase4: oh cool.
make do with what ya got @_@
someone ding me when black ops finishes, got some code to work on
Can the pencils blend? :|
I only have one colored pencil D:
awh D:
what color is it
Can I pass some pencils through my computer screen? guess not huh..
not with the standard models
</3 not enuf technology.
You know, SuperBrony64, this looks pretty interesting. But I be too poor for a Wii >_____>
10,02Awww, it's okay, you can come over anytime to play on my Wii (NOT A SEXUAL INNUENDO >_<)
not an episode announcement?
nope
just gratuitous trixie
no trixie ep yet
Hey phase, what code stuff are you working on?
playing with markov chains
looking at the most bizar bug i've ever seen
what language?
Oh SB...dat aim :P
c
want to lode huge documents into it, anything else would use to much memory
load'
the problem i'm having is a sorted lookup, string compares get slow when your doing 100000 per word
are you using tries?
"tries"?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie
nope, binary search
call of duty?
hopefully trixie will appear in another episode on season 2, i've grown attached to her despite her arrogance
a hashtable might be faster as well
no experience with trees yet, doing this to learn a bit more about memory managment
meh, hastable would be a binary search anyway
Ingwaz: hopefully.
i just started using pure C myself
hi
reaaally missing c++
turns out memory managment is easy, the problem i'm having is a pointer that goes nuts betwene functions
hi meh
hi phase4
taught me heaps about gdb looking for the bug
is sb playing CoD on the wii? i wasnt aware people actually played it on the wii
same here
haha
do you aim with the wiimote?
hope not, that thing is jumpy
worked well enough in re4
i cant imagine playing an FPS on something other than PC though
dunno, maybe they fixed it, i sold my wii ages ago considering it spent months on end inside its box
i had a few different gun things for the wiimotes to go into that were pretty good for shooters
Back~
welcome back Starflash
welcome back starflash
greetings
i should really finish my homework and just go to sleep....
so what have i missed the past ohhhh id say about 4-7 days i was here for the episode at least but thats it ive been busy every other day though
00,10hah you just asked if SB aims
meh: not much, you did see the episode right?
xD
10,02Yes, I'm playing Call of Duty Black Ops on the Wii
yeah but i pulled an all nighter and missed the beginning like 8 minutes but then i saw what i missed on youtube
i flipped
10,02And No, I'm not using a Wii Remote and Nunchuck
10,02I'm using the Classic Controller Pro
meh: EVERYONE flipped
indeed
i was reading chat when i woke back up and i was like O_O
FUUUUUUU
I flipped again at demon pinkie o.o
should have seen the normaly quiet rooms
they were as nuts as #bronystate
oh yeah i was definetly there for crazy pinkie
i was laughing in sheer terror
/me will NEVER break a pinkie promise
^
Cool part is that they uncanoned a certain other much more creepier pinkie.
/me unpauses stream, sees cod, pauses again and returns to his code.
when she first started making her angry face i was already terrified and then she like exploded im like O_O HOLY!
I still love the gamecube controller over everything else, probably because it was my first consol
/me loved the 'picklebarrel kumquat' bit
oh my god, the Italian version of the MLP intro is so epic o.o
that was hillarious
Arentius: link?
somepony should make a picklebarrel kumquat remix
weaponised pinkie
totally
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dchiYx5Hzo&feature=player_embedded
overall it was a good episode only thing is
?
hmm
idk how to word my thoughts
something about AJ's pride
hmm
good morning
thats a very different sort of intro
they got a custom one, I are jelly
oh right that intro
00,10You say it like it's bad meh
?
what
At least y'all got voice actors in yer country.
2.8k views, 900 likes
I got... people who think they can voice act
4 dislikes
the intro or the episode sumica?
00,10the intro
That intro is long.
oh its not that its just something

yeah

i remember this music from super smash bros
stream has frozen on the frog
Dat fucking toad
it got better
dat interlaced
slippy
the interlacing is killing the stream
y u no progressive
SuperBrony64 the stream can't handle the N64's awesome.
wait, this is a real n64? i assumed it was vc
make em do night at the roxbury
if slippy werent slightly auseful in boss battles id let him die always
lol 64
Superbrony64 : there is component cables for the Wii
i like this title music
his capture card is composit
10,02My capture card doesn't support component :(
10,02I own component cables for the Wii though
:[
wrong fluttershy
10,02BUT SILLY NINTENDO 64 WASN'T PROGRESSIVE
/me bought the component cables too, worth the $15
:'(
10,02Progressive scan I mean :P
10,02But this version is actually 480p on the Wii
k whats a component cable?
...
yeah yeah
Oh nooes!
10,02It's a video cable that splits up the video signal into three separate cables
its like the fibers making up the universe
oooh the red white and yellow?
You know. I should really go replay some of those old games.
the n64 does progressive internaly, you can attach it to a vga monitor with some clever soldering
no thats composite
10,02That's composite (the yellow one)
10,02Red blue and green is component
dat music
I heard there is a spike-a-thon today
never heard this before haha
oh ive seen those once (ONCE)
Will Bronystate stream the spike-a-thon?
probably not
aww yea time to save dat lylat system
SuperBrony64: is the deinterlace option turned on?
10,02Nah, I felt it lagged the stream a bit.
I luv dis game
Dats why

10,02But really, it doesn't do much I don't think...

admittedly, for the N64 being a cartridge based game system, the graphics were amazing for it's time.
mhm
true dat
n64 had a lot of great games
should have been better but most programers didnt relise how to use cartridges
First time I played Orcarina of Time, rainbows of awesomeness fell out of my mouth.

oh hey its the first boss from ocarina of time
dat bossfight
boss battle!
for some reason this boss reminds me of the last one in Borderlands
Pre-DLC?
or Kraw
mfw "char *lookup" should be "int *lookup"

Dashie_Dashie: i could hug you
they had 256mb carts i think
or make one like what I did
10,02No wait, that's Panzaar Dragoon >_<
SuperBrony64: only have $10 of internet money
Phase4: afterglow ps3 controllers are cheap, but unlike their 360 counterparts, they actually hold up
/me hugs /meh

good morning
O_O
Morning derpy_pony
did he really just say that?
mooponi1: its working wierd, seems to be somewhere else in my code
you know it returns false when the strings are equal right?
"asdf" is ending up greater than "a", should be less. "a" and "b" compare right
I don't understand, what's going on?
i debugged that for way too long
yes
asdf comes after a in the dictionary
so a < asdf sounds right to me
ohai #BronyState
10,02:D
it's quiet...
yay
too quiet
10,02Hey
ohai ^_^
10,02Hai :3

It's the digital drawing style of MLP
made up of points connected together with straight clear lines
/me is interested
Lol. HeavyMetalDash: Apparently everypony goes OMGFLUTTERSHY because I've got an instant +5 favs or something...
/me busy having seizure
SB I don't mean straight as in straight, I mean straight as in... even, clear
10,02Vectoring is the use of mathematical formulas for lines that helps renders drawings. Really fun to make stuff with :3
/me stops

28% of the planet's hair care products are consumed by norway

lol you win da game
whistles are boring
Secret Coin Fun
with 2 whistles you can get to the last world from world 1 ~.~
10,02World 2 actually
there is a second whistle in level 3
10,02But yes, you can cheat the entire game with two whistles :P
lol
10,02Yes, but you need to be in World 2 in order to reach World 8
2 whistles?
really? i recall using a whistle in the whistle world
10,02There are three total whistles in the game
and got to world 8
/me would rather go through all worlds without using flute, ish moar fun
watch "the wizards"
know secret locations
10,02Yeah, but using a whistle in World 1 brings you to select between world 1-3
10,02Using the Whistle in World 2 lets you select World 4-6
2 whistles at a time
and if you use a whistle again you land in world 8
10,02Then you can use it to go to World 8
10,024-7 I mean
brb dinner
yummy
10,02OMG DAT FAIL

Just next to Arabian fonts in ASCII there is this ؓ
I wonder who's the least popular of the mane six...
zoom in - it's a bomb
Guess I should complete the other 3 first before I find out
Uh... Applejack I guess Starflash ~
War incoming
From Fluttershy, Twilight and AJ it's Applejack, in any case.
But that one was pretty obvious.
Ishey: the font being used in lightirc cant render that, but it knows its vertcal text and acts acordingly
Oh no.. its too late
I'm wondering bout Pinkie Pie - AJ - Rarity <_>
What war?~
Fan-war
/me doesn't argue~
Phase4: So you dont see bug: Ӫ ?
twilight is best pony
We all know that _____ is better then ____
Nah forget it they all rock
Ishey: i got this

Bug is happy Ӫ
ؓ

its some vertical font character
My mane is itchy.
I find that (Insert not well known pony) is the best pony~ /hipster
Well, does it look like a bomb?
Lol Nyria

Im starting to like these
07,01I don't
Starflash: What about side by side of a downloader?~
Protip: when mods dun like what yer doing, stop :)
07,01bronies unite!
Nyria Aye.
Huzzah
if anyone is interested in the file i'm getting this from, tell me. i'l compress it up and post a link
07,01So.. who was here during the live ep?
ME!
DERPY!
: )
/me was asleep~
07,017 rooms exploded...
07,01god..
I was in a different room.
Lol. yeah.
Lulu: 8, regulars one too
I was in dash
07,01so much CAPS!
it allso went boom
/me watches the video of the mane room exploding
my video derped when it happened
07,01that's cause you need a proper client ;)
	Text: derpy	Count: 2719 :: this log must be from before that
indeed I do
Someone needs to make a history file of brony history~

07,01I'm sorry US ponies...
07,01http://www.slashgear.com/filesonic-and-others-cease-file-sharing-amid-megaupload-fallout-23210299/
You should hire some extra wreks in advance for the next time there's too much ALLCAPS...
poor wrek...trying to stop the flood
The feeling's mutual Lulu.
Other countries have to get screwed because of mine.
nO ALLCAPS
interesting, norio ocourd twice, both times folowed by wakamoto
I rather call it..
07,01The internet should be a free place..
07,01I said it !
My Royal cantelot voice
/me is going to play Viva La Vida everyday until this event is over~
Lulu we all agree T__T
(unoriginal joke)
Wait, What happened?
soo true
torrents are still working, internets free enough for me
At least I still have my health. *cries*
torrents have a tendancy to break my computer
anonymous vpn's that accept webmoney or bitcoins are available for less than $5 per month
07,01Well.. the thing is.. most ponies are unaware about the bills.. and the secrecy that comes with them...
Revloution~!
by wich i meen i can transfer whatever i want, not the pirating but
bit'
07,01I mean who heard of ACTA?
Lulu: They said the bill didn't pass.
/me is kinda scared by acta
I think they lied.
What's going on!?
They lied straight to our faces.
07,01xcanox there's a new bill in the making
dont ask me
ohai xcanox
MegaUpload wouldn't have closed if SOPA didn't pass.
07,01that's so not true..
07,01SOPA had nothing to do with MegaUpload
People say Megaupload was their 'revenge'.
I'm just waiting for anonymous to take down republic websites~
you're being trolled, Lulu
07,01yea.. I guess
At least we don't have to worry about the Republicans slipping SOPA the next essential bill.
derpy_pony: stfu
That language~
07,01but yea don't mind me.. i'll fight for a free net
07,01let's keep it civil shall we?
watch your language, xcanox
Don't call me a troll.
come on we're all freinds
I don't troll, never have. In this channel anyway.
Indeed, We are not the Brony channel, where bronystate... So keep it civil~
He didn't call you a troll. =w=

Did we stream that MLP mini-marathon yesterday?
Nope

Fire Breath
07,01have fun
Bye TOY_PON3
oh i will Luna :D
thats 1 M.C. dont know how to pluralize word
What exactly stopped him when he was a little dargon from burning a few ponies alive?
Er... an even littler dragon
x__x
07,01Well dear ponies i'm gonna Lurk for a bit, i'll be back later!
have fun
Have fun lurking Luna
Cya
07,01Lulu = lurky luna
No answers on how Spike could burn ponies alive?
Luna The Lurker
lolol.
lol
being hatched by ponies , he sees them as parental figures, also we dont know at what point in his gowth he got firebreath
Maybe he could breathe a lot of fire before, then there was an accident and he's been sealed >:3
lol @ 'accident'
And then what exactly happened to ponies he could have thoerettically set ablaze?
y do u guys think i have a short tail like this?
Not much? Derpy prooved that ponies, when set ablaze, do not burn up or something.
also we see him accidentally roasting the doctor in "S o m E" , and hes merely slightly singed , baby dragon breath is arguably even weaker
just blacken
Hm, alrighty then
also Twi's been on fire twice
Any other ideas on what to discuss?
Nope, I gotta make an essay on internet addiction. =w=
Well she's a Rapidash she doesn't count
dat logic
Sooo... how's about them canon?
specify
If Derpy is indeed Derpy
Who's Ditzy Doo?
I still accept both names as canon
i think we're going the way of the nickname with Derpy now
Ditzy "Derpy" Doo
^
though that being said, i didn't particularly like the use of a "slow" voice for her
she's a clutz, not "slow"
Frankly they could have handled Derpy a LOT worse
wut?
Oh..
Just making her Mr. Derp would have gotten a few laughs and a sad sigh from the fandom
as long as they don't spotlight her every episode now I'll be good
Also, Dash doesn't seem to like Derpy
give her a voice more similar to the one used in the various Dr. Whooves/Ditzy radio plays
well dash's annoyance was justified
and StinkomanFan would you particuarly like someone who just fried your tail and dropped a support beam on your head?
I like to compare them to Carlton and Urkel
Family Matters FTW
lol :D
So Twilights magical developement , whats next , given that so far herspecial seems to be teleportation
StinkomanFan /)
I'm sure she's much more capable just not as willing to show it off
(\LunaTheBeloved
I miss that show.....
She's going to develop some nice skills in Transformation
Or mindswapping
Both are good for plo-storylines
a mindswap episode could be hillarious
i can't see one happening though; they can be hard to keep up with, unless cutie marks are connected to the mind/soul, rather than the pony
true...I can dream though...or write fan-fiction
Transfiguration is still open right?
we've already seen twilight do it on non-living things, so yeah
and on her parents
yeah, but that was magic diahrrea
it doesn't exactly count
Twi become Griffon
And god knows how many Fan-fics involve Spike becoming a pony, so it won't exactly feel too far off
Just sayin'
Twi become dragon
Fluttershy becomes a tree </obligatory>
:D
Or just RD becoming an Earth pony. Because that plo-storyline went nowhere fast
I would kill to see that
well there is that one fic where dash's wings get grafted onto Applejack
We're also forgetting another Magical unicorn
huhwut?
/me sends Trixie BACK to china
no we arent <_<
rarity?
if the mane 6 were benders , what kind ?
nice shipping MirrorImage
Yes Rarity
And Sweetie Belle
I can't see Rarity becoming too to upset with anything of that sort
Sweetie Belle is a clean slate!
rarity losing her unicorn magic? she would flip
She has no prior magic abilities!
Unicorn is a status symbol to her, for one thing, and she wouldn't be able to make her dresses
in my head , Sweetybot is best sweetybelle
I...guess
I dunno I just can't see it
Or we could always hope the CMC accidentally release another horrible monster unto the land
lol
they release the G3 ponies
ohgono
ohgodno
"You fools! You've messed up the natural ORDAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
we need catpeople though , diamonddogs are meh
am I teh only one that want a scootaloo episode?
StinkomanFan: just wait for Past Sins to become canon
/me runs and hides
So Scootaloo goes to town and... I got nothing
exactly they could do pretty much anything with her
yeah... they're really digging themselves into a corner with Scootaloo and the family stuff
At least with Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle we have SOME idea of her personal life
HeavyMetalDash: they could, but it'd be difficult to make it believable, unless they suddenly go "Oh, by the way, here's Scootaloo's house and family"
maybe a scootaloo rainbow dash adventure
Scoots enters a pee-wee rodeo?
that's what i would expect - "Hey Rainbow Dash, can you teach me how to fly?" "hu-buh-WHAT?!"
:D
Applejack ? how didyou get so small ?
Ah, yes. The infamous Appleteeny
that's "Appletini," like the drink
lol much more obscure refrence
wat i miss i was busy staring at something over there
i never would've known about the alcohol reference in Applejack if someone hadn't mentioned it
was it pony?
/me stares at guitar
you not pony
So, Big Macintosh. BESIDES the obvious Sex God status in our fandom
What does he have to offer?
character development
...and for some reason, my mind clicks to Sweet Apple Massacre on that line...
bad brain, bad!
i mainly use the internet for pon .
/me shudders
I mean, is he a quiet intellegent individual?
sweet apple massacre?
porn ? pony ? porny ? thats my secret
Is he a Genious with muscles?
HeavyMetalDash: it's a gorefic with no point but to try and outgore Cupcakes
DoNT READ IT
^
Is he just a Muscular man with common sense?
What is he?
i believe he's a Forrest Gump
uh...well...I can't say I won't because thats what I said when I in't read the fic that shall not be named
Magic is as magic does....
Life is like a box of apples
HMD i dont know wat ur talkin about
wat fic?
The Pinkie Pie one
Spiderses
you're really going to make me refrence the title..oh you scar me so
?sekacpuc
Yes
/me shudders
it's so bad I wrote a song about it
dat logic
Moving on. Cheerilee: Hot For a Teacher or just a normal Lady trying to get through her life?
depends - pigtails Cherilee or show Cherilee
^
Show Cheerilee
We never speak about Pigtails Cheerilee
Hot , you saw the hat she gave spike , now imagine her wearing that
that mare knows where its at
she has style
but I'm not convinced
"Are you trying to seduce me Miss Cheerilee?"
words i never want to say again ^
words I'll probably end up saying
Cheerilee seems a bit... oblivious at times though
she's teaching pony kindergard... is that kindergarden there?
what "grade" would that class be the equivalent of?
everypony who isn't a filly seems that way though
nah its school
Tommy_Wisseau: perhaps, but kindergarden for me was basically "grade 0.5"
I doubt any other teacher would let Diamond Tiara be a bitch without some kind of scolding
yes, but it's all a matter of perspective
was DT being smiteful or playful?
around 4th grade maybe
"scolding"
exactly what I mean...everypony seems oblivious of the obvious bullies
where maybve 10% of the teachers ever recognize bullying, and they're never the ones you're being taught by
I prefer my canadian one thank you very much
we often deal with obvious problems
At least Granny Smith has being senile to blame for being ignorant on such things
i believe the thought is "When you're this old, you just don't give a damn anymore"
OKay im back
welcome back Frank
i recall getting a random talk from my grandpa about "being responsible" when i get someone pregnant
she said that to my face once MirrorImage
#1 - at least he had the decency to say that in my own home, though it was still mortifying to me
Alright, DT and SS. Why they bigger bitches than Kyle's mom?
and #2 - that implies a "when," rather than an "if"
but moving on...
Did something happen for them to think bullying was a good idea or is it just
We're better than everypony
for DT, it's the standard rich-child entitledness
possibly a homelife thing
for SS, it's "I'm friends with the popular kid, so I must act like him/her as well"
if your father is filthy rich , it comes naturally
exactly
For being Popular they only seem to have each other to deal with
most of the time
and despite her cutie mark being a "silver" spoon, we haven't seen true indications of her being rich yet
i honestly wouldn't be surprised if that pearl necklace she wears is fake
we on't even have a proper understanding of their economy
we know enough about it that it works on a typical capitalist system
it is fake mirror. ive been close enough to tell
I mean, the only reason I say that is because they do not seem to interact with ponies other than themselves, the CMC, and Twist
I mean high quality gemstones are a common happenstance
And the latter two were to bully them
HeavyMetalDash: so their value system isn't identical, but it still has the same effect - someone wants something, so they'll pay X bits for it related to how valuable that item is
gemstones aren't at the same level of "value" as they are IRL, though they're still a status item in a way
then again , we havent hadan episode focus in the two , so we dont know what they do most of the time
i've been saying ever since that episode, i expect Silver Spoon will get herself a "redemption" episode eventually
yeah it still boggles my mind...I kind of want to know what the currency is though
Speaking of higher-crust society, how about Prince BlueBlood?
also pearls arent gems , and while gems are abundant , pearls come from shells
HeavyMetalDash: "bits"
cannon?
yes
He seemed more... In control to me
canon*
hmmmmm
i don't recall which episode that was, but we do hear them call them "bits"
Blueblood is the bi:Ohiest pony ive ever met
He knew what he was doing to piss off Rarity
i think it might've been in Ticket Master that AJ calls them bits, related to the "Saggy old barn" and GSmith's "Saggy old hip," etc
He is not an asshole of the normal definition he is a Troll
He is acting like that for the lolz
very informative thank you
also blueblood possibly just doesn't know any better
MI:they r bits. pinkie owes me 500 bits
definately in the best night ever , when rarity and BB order something to eat , that'll be 4 bits
The only reason he seems to have learned his lesson was because AJ showed up
With that giant cake
He was not prepared for such a possibility to show up and backfire
AJ accidental assualt of cake
most of wat i remember is getting kicked off stage
In summary, he was trolling Rarity and in control until the last moment
then i passed out :D
so um ... pony medicine ? Hip replacement and what else ?
Cure for Cutie Pox
ask Zecora, but it seems like there's a remedy for just about everything if you know where to look
we have all the stuff u humans do Tommy
yeah and apparently there is no need for dentistry
LunaTheBeloved: that seemed to be more like a mystical cure-all. i almost wouldn't be surprised if Cutie Pox could be cured by placebo effect
Zecora is not the standard of pony medicine
Possibly
wazzup
http://goo.gl/0UEkZ
I would beleive so
nuthin
HeavyMetalDash: she is a "potion master," more or less
that cutie mark could represent the stirring of a cauldron
this stream is taking forever to load for me
D:
Until something proves otherwise I would not doubt Zebras have Cutie Marks
nopony's streaming
oh
agreed, though it appears that Zebra Cutie Marks are less literal than pony ones
well that makes sense lol
4 now
she certainly knows about cutiemarks , enough so that she tells applebloom you cant force one
perhaps a cultural difference or regional
Symbolism is big in zebra culture from what I've seen in the show
well zebras are a bit of an "african" / tribal stereotype as portrayed
at first I thought you meant 4 people weren't streaming now
lol
BANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBANBNBABANBNABABNBAABNANBANABABNBANBAANBANBABAN
suddenly, Dari
it was just a joke
no all caps
:D
oh you silly filly
lol good morning
So, why the Everfree Forest?
:3
Why did she set up shop there?
o.o Scary Dari.
closer to ingrediants she would more often need
Trololololol olololol olol trololololol
Matt Smith will become a great doctor the day he dies and regenerates into someone decent
perhaps back in whereve she came from she lived in a place much like it
by the way how did you do that emote
im back
: D
no space
probably a bit of that too - though civilization does have a habit of destroying the natural plants in the given area
k
:D
morning everypony
awesome
Actually, a Zecora episode would be nice
morning Ingwaz
*david
I'm for Zecora episode
Tennant. :D
Tennant is pure sex ^.^
there you are now 20% cooler
Hello!!!
:3
to quote Ringo: i carn't spel
why hello there
Ola Senior
lawl
buenos dias!
Speaking of the Doctor, Doctor Whoof.
We all know what the fandom perceives him as
/me has exhausted his grasp of spanish
But what would he be like in show?
aaaaaaa spanish :P
Que?
I heard that the hub adopted the title
o gawd they're gonna ruin doctor whoof
well it's certainly easier to refer to a pony by name than as "Background_Pony1234"
Uh, yes? lolidunno
managed to make a trip to a local walmart and get ahold of some blind bag ponies, sadly there were only 6 left and none of them were the mane 6
and if we're going to name them anyways, then all the better for them
they're gonna introduce bronys to the Doctor ? win
/me is confused
also why is nopony streaming
/me sad
though if they do give the Doctor any (more) lines, if they give him a british accent, then it'll be pure fanservice
yes all the win
Te amo
SB64 is sleepy time
I mean, the good Doctor is a fan favorite but is he just some coincidence?
speak in english
english is the only language I understand
I think so
yes, he probably is
Entiende el ingles?
Do you understand english
yes
lol
I doubt that Tennant snuck into the studio and screwed with the charactor creator for the lulz
so, the moderator scripts by RAWRity... who would be the best me if i were in the 4th?
indeed
Donde esta el bano?
Weird Al Yankovic
lol
wat
where is the bathroom?
third door on the left
did anything ever come of that request for Al to be a guest star pony?
i really gotta go :S
i could've sworn someone mentioned that he was asked back in April
I AM NOT HERE FOR SPANISH LESSONS :[
IDK I though it was just a rumor
:O
die his hair blond and straighten it maybe and YEEEESSS weird al is best me
^
Estoy triste.
and again wit dat spanish
I mean, he did a guest spot on Transformers I don't see why not
what have I done!
it means im sad :'(
:'(
lol timing
brb gotta let my dogs in
awwwww
wait... Al got a guest spot in Transformers?
who let the dogs out?
lawl
:D
don't be sad here have a rainbow dash
:D
or a twilight :)
i might get kicked for this but Micheal Vick
k back
i want a derpy
He paid his dues, let him live peacefully
so StinkomanFan, Weird Al got a voice role in Transformers?
:P here
Llame a la policía!
and the g1 transformers they played dare to be stupid
call the police!!
how do you say I am a brony?
im in rainbow dash's room?
i thought i was in bronystate :P
#bronystate
hello!
my...question....
Cello!
Te amo
<3
is the stream streaming?
And yes, Al had two
nopie dopey
i don't think there's a stream, no
i saw Al live in NC
I want too see Al live
sorry my lappy crashed
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY&list=LLt7r1FRquoyxbJ1xbCw2ytw&index=2&feature=plpp_video
What did I miss?
now all that being said, who wants to bet that the next time Al gets invited to host a panel at a con, SOMEONE will ask him to read a letter to Celestia?
I'm not a betting man
So, what did I miss?
hey
:(
RAWRity... i better be in the fourth moderator film...
Hi RAWRity
StinkomanFan: if there IS one. I still have nothing to put in it.
literally all I have is the title.
What did I do?
StinkomanFan: sorry, I meant String_Shredder
drop it!
you bastards with your st names all look the same to me.
Racist :|
Typist
communist
:D
Do you think we'll ever get a Celestia episode?
*hi
doubtful
I mean, we know little more about her than we did earlier in the series
hi
All we know now is that she has a pet bird
didnt g1 have a princess celestia?
pet Phoenix
A Pheonix is a type of bird
much better than bird
I wouldn't classify it as such
It has feathers and a hollow bone structure. If Scootaloo can be classified as a bird than so can Philimona
chicken also not bird too me
I'm obviously being too picky
but yea
It is not like we're dealing with a platypus! It is a frigging bird!
Chickens are birds.
platypus=bird :D
It's not complicated!
what can I say sometimes I like to stand on the idiot side of the fence
lol
It's a beaver with a duck bill, that lays eggs and has poisonous claws.
why is stream not working?
It's not up Quadrenaro
k
cuz the mods have school/day jobs
"I was promised a creature wtih impossible Biology, with poisonous claws and fire-breathing!"
and lives
except dari
I have school...
Isn't he a kidder?
I have accepted my no-life and acquired ponies
So, the pets
Why do people like Gummy so much?
wouldn't you want a pet aligator?
To me he just looks like a derp
Of nature
Perhaps because of the unconventional nature of an alligator being a pet
i live in florida
i see gators often
as pets?
Something that would have died had Pinkie Pie not come out of no where and took him
i wouldnt be surprised if a had a dozen gators within a mile of me right now
so not as pets
ive carried a 5 footer over my shoulder once
nope not as pets
my point is still valid then
But what happens when Gummy grows up? Is he going to end up giving into his nature and try to eat everything?
he has no teeth
it was dead of course
lol
gummys 1 right?
and doesn't he kind of already do that?
We are talking a cartoon. Pinkie Pie can eat a cake in one bite, when he grows up he'll just...
gators dont try to eat EERYTHING
Eat ponies in one bite
lol
When they are hungry they hunt
nope.avi
scavange
It is not quantom physics
unless it's domesticated and placent with being fed by our dear pinkius pieicus
other than fish they usually eatthings that are already dead
Alright, Opal. It's a cat, it does cat things. We have nothing else to talk about there
it probably eats mostly cake anyways
is gummy gonna talk?
tvtropes brought up a depressing point. The lesson of "Secret of My Excess" is boys grow up and become selfish monsters -or that one should never grow old, but be cute and manageable forever.
thats why he has no teeth, pinkie gives him too much sugar
Winona, same thing as Opal except as a dog
lol
I dunno Winona can jump right on top of a cows back and keep her?...balance
Same for Tank and Owlu-wtf is his name
Of course, we all want to see Gummy as a huge Gator that kicks ass, guess :D
owlicious
I guess*
who?
Pinkie riding gator is win
I'm calling him Hooter from now on
Because it's funnier
lawl
it sure is
The only other notable pet is Angel Bunny
And only because he's a bigger dick than DT and SS combined
also same for tank?...how about we discuss his home life
Good Morning Everypony! :3
like what the hell RD lives in a cloud house!
buenos dias!
He's a tortiose. He sits around and eats leaves
Tank probably just chills around RD's house.
Good morning
:3
so the turtle can cloud walk now or is that heliblade thing just always attached?
It's not like we're talking this huge anaconda or a smill child
It's a turtle!
i imagine he's got some kind of enchanted accessory that allows for cloudwalk
probably a collar or something
I just realized how purposterous this conversation is :D
We're nerds!
so much fun
conversations on the internet? purposterous? what a purposterous thought
If weren't talking Ponies, we'd be talking Star Trek
I be aninerd
Also, I remember this thing that always disturbed me in this one cartoon. :s It's the obvious 'Furry Confusion' thing.
I out of loop 4 star trek
^
It was full of colorful chartoon charactors with animal features
HeavyMetalDash: I mean that if it wasn't this fandom, it would be another.
name?
And then from nowhere we see a human skeloton
Oh dear.
I gothya
And they blow it off like it's normal
wtf?
I mean, it was next to a sunken pirate ship but the point is not that it's a dead body
wat http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/117127
Byut it's a dead HUMAN body!
How anthro are they? They might have assumed it was a skeleton of an anthro minus some distinguisng characteristics
a lost relic of a forgotten time...and race
distinguishing*
It was Happy Tree Friends
OHGODNOO
I remember in Pikmin when Olimar found a Human Jaw....
seriously
Pikmin 2
The thing was twice the height of them and they dismissed it!
StinkomanFan: I haven't seen HTF in a while, but last I checked, they sure as heck didn't care about consistency. lol. But I see what you mean, it was plainly obvious it wasn't a creature like them, and they took it for granted. HTF did that on purpose.
When I see something human-esque in a world of non-human creatures and they ignore it it just disturbs me
13morning ponies~
Hi, Shizuka.
Morning Shizuka, and congrats by the way
Hey Shizuka
13thanks~
Morning
well afternoon to me
I mean, what if OUT OF NOWHERE the Mane Six find a picture of some human and throw it over there shoulder with not even a blink of an eye?
It would be pretty jarring to me
8,1i'm frozen
well it could be posibly better explained in MLP
True, but MLP wouldn't throw in a muman skeleton because they're not trying to freak out the viewers
they have magic the all encompassing non-answer
human* ...me and these typos today...
man I've been logged on for like ever!
and now, for a dash of politics
MLP: FiM is probably operating on the premise that humans don't exist in their world, every species is a quadriped.
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/supreme-court-holds-warrantless-gps-tracking-unconstitutional.ars some faith in humanity has been restored
/me pops her back
/me 8,1evaporates
8,1evenin' Fleur
Thank goodness, there's an honest-to-god bottom to this madness.
hello
8,1how's tricks?
So, now that I've got that monkey off my back.
let's do pscho-analysis of somepony
8,1how are you?
8,1how's it hanging?
8,1what, as the say, is up?
ooohhhh
How about The obvious one AppleJack!
its kinda dangling a little to the left
yea
8,1john watson is best soldier
So, AJ seems to have issues coping with failure
AJ is an over-acheiver
/me is bored and sitting on campus waiting for class
8,1just like rainbow dash
8,1Fleur: simple solution: plane trip to scotland
deep seated ones too I mean I would be so proud to come in second
she doesnt have issues coping with failure. She promissed to bring back the money and that is what she was trying to do.
The two seem to have an odd obsession with being the best
I mean, really dark interpretations of the Mane 6 are easily countered.
8,1pinkieshy is cutest shipping
She doesnt care about being the best.
Fleur: it isn't that she has an issue coping with it, but more along the lines of facing the consequences
Fleur !!! :3
Hello Cy
/me sits on a couch eating brownies
I have something awesome to tell you :3
She said she'll do something, and the issue was "Oh crap, I can't do X"
What drives me mad is how Rarity and RD are basically the ponies the Crew likes to make look bad.
8,1rarilight is most interesting shipping
Randomnerd: how so?
she doesnt have issues facing consequences. She /prommised/ to bring back money to fix the building.
do you think she's just too placent with being the best...or perhaps she just gets a thrill from competition
She doesnt like breaking her prommises
Alright, Pinkie Pie. She breaks the moment nopony shows up for her parties
Rarity has maybe embodied her element without prompting, once. "Suited for Success".
she loves competition
fair competition.
Fleur: along the same line of the theme of sneaky promises - she promised her "prize money" to fix the roof
but if she didn't win any prize money...
Every other time, she has to get embarrassed first, then acts as a good friend.
that's no different than her "I'll tell you at breakfast" *skips breakfast* technicality
before she left she said she would bring back the money to fix the roof
Hence why she got her part-time job
she didnt say where the money had to come from
Pinkie pie breakdowns are hard as her persona is somewhat stochastic
exactly. She isnt ashamed of failure. She is ashamed of breaking prommises
she seemed ashamed too me at the end of the episode
so reviewing the episode, all i see her say "promise" wise is "I promise to make Ponyville proud"
She cracks once somepony breaks there promise, she cracks when everypony ignores her
Randomnerd rarity was the first to volutier to have Twi use magic on her (which could be very dangerous)
Now, back at the farm she was most likely ignored a majority of the time for work
yeah then the second she has a chance to shine she enters the best young fliers competition
lol
But that's not generosity. I think Rarity is AWESOME. But all we ever see is her being a stuck-up user.
she is a narc
She gives Spike something he's wanted since he came to ponyville for his ruby
Derpy is a very helpful pony. She just wants to be a part of everything and help out wherever she can. So she's happy to help with deliveries, or with doing tech work for the Hearth's Warming play, or setting up banners in the town hall. Whatever it takes, she just wants to help.Maybe one day, somepony will say "thank you" instead of asking her to stop.
that made me sad
I have an exam in a few hours and here I am discussing ponies mental issues
also, who said she was a delivery pony?
I'm sure she'd be a good friend if the other ponies gave her a chance
Fleur: that was a fanon interpretation way back in the beginning
I'm sure she has freinds
that moving service could have been a temp job
^
based on how much she dropped, i'm sure it was at that point
I think despite the rough edges she probably has a good relationship with RD
Vanity's fine. Someone's gotta be the prissy one. She made dresses for her friends and the only "Selfish" thing about that was she wanted to show them off to Ponyville (she didn't invite Hoity-Toity)
but regardless, we really don't see much in the line of "work" around Ponyville, other than shop keepers and working Sweet Apple Acres
inb4 she turns out to be RD's sister
I'm sure there were already plenty of fanfics before that
Who is the Economy in Equestria?
*How
lol
hmmm
The bits are soarin
they sell apples and apple accessories
it's doing well
4 bits for a half barrel of apples
2 bits for an apple fritter
"Back in my day a NICKLE would buy us a BARREL of candy!"
anyway I expect DH and RD too have a freindship akin too AJ an Rarity
Apples and apples and apples and japples
then again, that was durring the GGG
so a quarter of a barrel of apples goes into a single fritter?
no
Not very good at crafting are they?
lawl
well they have hooves
StinkomanFan: when you compare it to Team Fortress, they're great at it
that might make it hard to cook
and magic
which would make it easier
true, magic doesn't have to explain anything
Hat becomes metal
a wizard did it....
not many magic chefs around ponyville
"Quick, get me 72 random weapons and I'll make you a Cowboy Hat!"
Fleur: All I want is to see Rarity do something genuinely selfless, is all.
prove it
"...Maybe"
I understand that Randomnerd :p
she did when she made those dresses for the mane6
Randomnerd: does Episode 2 no longer count?
Two hats= One new hat
The dresses in the first season was Selfless, yes.
im back
Ok I can get that
dissprove it MirrorImage
72 weapons=1 hat
disprove what?
Ok no
Should shako for two refined!
She hasn't done anything like that in 20 eps or more.
stinko you shoulda tried WoW
Stout shako even
10 buzzard asses nets you a brand new chestpiece
I'm sure she will
Minecraft had a better hat system
Get metal
Make hat
Being acquisitive is fine -I mean, you can't give to others if you have NOTHING.
Simple!
Minecraft has a hat system?
yes
you have a wide selection
Randomnerd: yeah, that's always been my thought on Rarity - she's a lot more complex than one might think
^
in order to be Generous, one must also be equally Greedy
I know they have armor but I didnt know you could make hats
Despite my distaste for her attitude most of the time I can't bring myself to genuinely dislike dear Rarity
I believe she IS generous, but she just wants her time in the spotlight
/me suddenly wonders if Pinkie gets paid to throw parties
Dear.
Rarity is like that woman from the shop in The Room
she does feel like she's stuck in a rut in ponyville when she could be in Canterlot
You can't hate her no matter how hard you try
I can
Pinkie must do so. She probably does the parties at Sugarcube Corner and Cleans them up.
but I dont want to try <3
speaking of why can't Rarity just move to canterlot...I sence another good quality about her
because of her friends
Well, if you latched onto anypony's bad quality, you could milk that for days.
Pinkie Pie to be perfectly honest, scares me
indeed
AAAWWWW yay...
she cant because she doesnt make enough to move there yet. Aslo, yes. her friends
She just seems clingy
"Rarity's a stuck-up tart! RD's obnoxious! Fluttershy's a wimp!" so on and so forth.
Fluttershy a wimp? pshhhaw
Obnooxious...you sir are...
But those are all true, Randomnerd .
right
In other words, lets all gather around the water cooler and discuss who's a total bitch today :P
She goes wherever she wants
Fleur: I know :D
Fluttershy is stronger, mentally, than any of the other ponies
Whenever she wants
and yet somehow weaker
Sundaysmile: Yes, it's easy to bitch about anything.
You cant break her.
discord did...
Pshyically, she's made of cardboard.
not really
Ha ha ha
HeavyMetalDash: I was merely making a point -people can piss and moan about anything.
Discord got owned
Discord had to cheat to do that
Fluttershy is a physical, not MORAL coward.
also, he is FUCKING Discord!
Getting eaten by a dragon is a legitimate fear.
who's fucking discord?
all Discord was doing was breaking the mental resolves of each pony to make his magic easier to use
I know Rondomnerd just toying with ya
All ponies are bad, no ponies are good.
but Fluttershy is mentally weak enough that he can just affect her by default
rather, Fluttershy *was*
Frankly it just seems that Pinkie Pie would be the pony that would be staring at me from my ceiling when I wake up
His rage gave him sufficient focus.
Anywho, have some Pie sisters to show I am not a bad person. http://i40.tinypic.com/i6a3v7.png
StinkomanFan: she would be.
Ceiling Pie is watching you mas... nevermind
MirrorImage: he couldnt do that to Fluttershy :3 he couldnt get her to change without force
He could have brute-forced all the Ponies, but it was crueler to attack their weaknesses.
She's just unnerving
Fleur: who's to say that isn't what he did to the other 5?
yeah but then Pinkie woulkd then leap down from the ceiling and be all like "you're finally awake I was waiting to throw you this super special party!"
break their resolve by hitting their element, then cast Mind Control
That AJ would actually prefer a lie is what made it horrifying.
he let them start changing before he did the final push
true, but flutterbitch was a refreshing sight
If Discord just said "Do the opposite of what you'd normally do", that's not really a challenge.
not too many ponies are that poor natured
excluding NM
I would say including NM
"Good boy, Angel! Momma's so proud!" ._.
/me hides in a corner
NM was a main villain, that's why I excluded her
I just find her smile and perky attitude disturbing. Perhaps it's from all those horror films I've seen
I loved when she said that <3
I mean ponies in general around town are always so nice
Like Misery
lololol
true
like what?
"We'll have a party!"
/me sledgehammer
"Forever!"
......
...?
StinkomanFan: Kathy Bates's Character was Manic-epressive, yes?
O.O
dear god
what? Did I miss something?
Actually, PP might be a lesson regarding kids with issues. ie: The kids that are all on Ritalin and stuff.
I need to watch the inception pinkie now
>.>
<.<
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWBbf2B9ELU&feature=fvst
PP is perfect tho
It's okay to be friends with "Weird" kids, and who is Pinkie Pie besides the weird kid.
it's like reading a b-movie...
It /is/ reading a b-movie
yeah I fucked up there thanks for the correction
Anyone who doesn't care for Rarity, there's an interesting perspecvtive on that. One Brony suggested that in most shows, Rarity would be the villain.
/me has yet to see a single horror movie that was actually scarry
...i'm tolerating the crap out of those comments about my favorite horror genre related books
This is getting kind of silly.
Liked "On Writing".
brb
I just don't like her. I don't hate her but the show just needs to be focused on someone other than her for me to enjoy her
Im sorry HeavyMetalDash. You are entitled to your oppinion and I am entitled to mine.
^
which is why I tolerate and silently lament no worries :D
Too much Pinkie Pie is bad for me
/me is bored at work...is the only person in today...
Alright guys, I'm gonna go grab lunch
Catch y'all laterz
anjoy the munch
*enjoy
Anyway, I personally dont find horror scarry. The only time I ever get scared while watching a horror movie is "jump scares" and that shit is not horror, its just fucking annoying and proves that you are a failure as a writer if you have to resort to that.
Now that I have gotten out why Pinkie Pie terrifies me
And then a skeleton popped out!
Let's move on to another pony
so you prefer more psychological horror fluer?
The other thing is that we see the evil counterparts of most of the ponies.
fleur*
Then who was phone?
yes
Evil counterparts?
Only problem. NOBODY can write a good one
Gilda is evil RD, DT is Evil Rarity, Trixie is Evil Twilight
Puppets - Daniel Heicht
Ah yes
it's not the story that's scary, but the concept
Their negative traits turned up to 11.
They are too chicken shit to write a good pshychological fucking story
Pinkie's gunna get a negative counterpart soon enough.
And it will be a donkey.
There's no negative Fluttershy, yet.
how could you make a negative fluttershy?
I frankly think Gilda was a nega-pinkie pie
Presumably an unprinicpled coward.
So....BlueBlood?
Gilda was just a sterotypical bad girl
seriously that wouldn't be exactly evil
Well, not the opposite (Humorless), I mean all of RD's bad traits writ large
I really hope the Flim Flam brothers are either like Mario and Luigi or sort of like the Mythbusters using SCIENCE!.
The what?
Better not be a spoiler
It may or may not be.
Rarity is vain, but she also likes to make ponies pretty on the outside, to match what they are inside.
^
how sweet
I heard about this, but thought it was a joke
If she were just VAIN, she'd be Diamond Tiara.
I'm betting it's following along the lines of Huck Finn...
I find the sheer AMOUNT of ponies in Equestria interesting
RD is in your face, but she's also a stand-up mare :)
why?
well they're a blank slate, that's the appeal
So many slates for people to work with
you're imagination is the limit
exactly
Gilda views loyalty as unquestioned obedience and attachment.
One can be a spacemare or a secret agent!

or a timelord....
While another can be a woman dealing with Marriage issues!
Space Marerin!
Loyalty is the option to help and generaly taking it.
It's an endless stream of possibilities!

10,02But...what if somepony else wants to stream O___o
Serious! The Protestant Work Ethic insists that God shows his love for people by giving them money.
well they should stream and keep me entertained until a good time where I can fall asleep.
Exactly what I wanted to spend an hour talking about
Therefore, anyone who is doing badly probably isn't going to heaven, and isn't worth helping.
it's already to late in the day to sleep here.. few ours and I'm out for a couple hours.
Where the streams at.

Hehe...i have built up an immunity ScootaChicken.
I'm not entirely sure about the myriad protestant views on Charity, but I'm sure some groups consider it to be a worth while endeavor, but they probably also don't believe in Predestination.
The real question is who are you? Who who who who

apparently, procrastinating on your work and staying up till the wee hours of the morning and only sleeping for a few hours before a full day of classes is quite physically tiring

Shizuka, are there any more half mods to come?
http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/search/default.aspx?searchBox=my+little+pony&sc_cmp=tescohp_sws-1_my+little+pony

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU2qtBm6V4c&feature=related

Ingwaz|Laptop: Oh, I wouldn't know about that. I know a metalhead who became bronies and now like Pinkie Pie.
a brony*
like spagetti hoops
I am not good with singular.
metal heads love Fluttershy

Pink iz metal I wear general metal attire and incorperate pink kitty paws to offset it
bai DashWithRainbows, be sure to high five him with a chair
Sundaysmile Pfft bricks. Tables are more fun
ScootaChicken i plan to.
Demonia boots plus pink paws =win
Have fun, Da-
Aww.
demonia boots are too clunky for my taste
thats only one pair I have
hmmm
I have no idea what you ponies are talking about. I don't even have any particular style asides from whatever was in the closet + a pony shirt.
I no haz pony shirt
same
/me cries
I WISH I had a pony shirt.
You should get one. They're awesome.
Black shirt or sweater, black denim and black suede
im back
that's it...
I've been looking on welovefine for one, but I dont know what to choose.
I may know a brony, but he might be trolling
f
ffffff
08,14awww du nto cry. . ..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGBM5Mw2SY
makes me happy
Oh yeah, that reminds me, are we sure whether or not Notch is a brony or could he still just be a magnificent bastard?
/me sniffle
I have a pony shirt
/me hgus HeavyMetalDash
okay Derpy
one pony shirt ;__;
I have 4 by now.
dont remember notch ever saying he was a brony
it is not enough pony!
One was a gift, though.
Honeydew is a brony.
:>
do remember him agreeing to watch some episodes though
I wanna play "What Lunda did for 1000 years now"
/me hug Derpy
Ingwaz|Laptop: He said so on his Twitter or whatever he uses.
I iz feels better now!
so many friends here on the moon
Dashie_Dashie: Yes, innit neat?
YUS.
:'( wish i could find brony clothes that i could actually fit in to
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1AVVKUuj3k
his d'awwww = Most epic brony evar.
I love Simon's AAAAHHHH.
you could always print your own ingwaz
most are done like such anyways
omfg I can print my own shirts!!! the thought hadn't crossed my mind
I might do that, but no one would understand :(
No one understands. No one knows my plan.
/me explodes with joy
not sure if sarcastic...
I would almost be willing to bet that no one here actually knows TMBG.
Almost.
13they might be giants?
Oh, wow.
I am surprise.
I know them, don't like them
whats that coming over the hill is it a pony?
13but no i don't really know them .-.
and I made that clear to them
ScootaChicken: dat Automatic Automatics ref
13just particle man and maybe something else
wait no, wrong band
Kammerjunk: I've listened through my friends, but I don't really know them. .__.
My friends think I'm weird for liking them.
triangle man
But then again, my friends think I'm weird anyway.
kammerjunk, we watch a show about brightly colored ponies, we're weird and we love it
Eeyup.
that's a sign you're a brony kammer
I wouldn't want it otherwise.
Kammerjunk: To each their own I say. If you like ponies, then good for joo ^_^ if they dont, who cares.
/me is a closet brony ;____;
I'm closeted
admittedly I am too
why ScootaChicken? arent you proud to be a brony?
I am brony and proud
Fleur, because I go to an all boys secondary school in the UK
Kammer, I'm dependant on keeping things on the downlow because of work...
openly stated through facebook and real life
My friends think I'm weird, but they're cool with it.
that should be an adequate answer
i find being a Brony makes a great litmus test for making friends
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m480ZuwkkYU
this is adorable
if they're cool with you being a brony, that's a great first step
I already knew that ScootaChicken. Why you no admit it?
if they have a problem with it... you probably won't be good friends
8,1hey MirrorImage: want to be my friend?
derpy's lamp is beautiful
certainly!
MirrorImage: Yes, the first step. And soon, they too shall be assimilated.
Fleur, because I'm going to get the shit torn out of me by everyone
8,1hullo LadyCanary and Dashie_Dashie
8,1<333
<3
:> <3
no you wont ScootaChicken. unless they are all imature turds
go back to being a blank flank!
friends come and go, you'll learn that in a few years
8,1i'm keeping them warm for her.
Fleur, the kind of are...
*they
OMG soo cute hnnnnggggg
8,1have you ever seen us in the same room at the same time?
/me seizure
I hate when someone pretends to be my friend, then backstabs me.
oh well
And in time, all shall be assimilated. Instead of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen! Not dark, but beautiful and brilliant as the dawn! Magnificent as the sea!
more to troll for meeeeeeeeeee
and skype call for that matter...
Dashie, avoid politics....
With more potential than the very foundations of the Earth!
8,1ScootaChicken: voice changer and 2 laptop

I Love when people on facebook call me a bum and a lazy person for not having a job ^_^

I'm sure we will Wrek
<3
Right! I shall go prepare speeches and stuff! Have fun with the stream, everypony.

This does sound nice so far~

Piano is like my second fav instrument

ohai derpy_pony
I have the patience of a 6 year old with ADD
13dat ghost

HeavyMetalDash, can you play piano?
and then Fleur was Ghosties
/me giggles

/me 13screams und hides under the blanket from the ghosts
NO
mfw Fleur is a mod in disguise
not really but I'm still practising
0,3hehe it is good Wrek
Guitar is still my mane
This is quite beautiful Wrek <3
/me cant listen atm :(
I just realised my screen is dirty
HeavyMetalDash, bass was my main instrument, then I started playing guitar about 8 months ago and I'm already Grade 4 ._.
it gives a whole "lone at the range" feels
playing bass helped way more than I thought it would...
Bass is my third
bob ross
I want Wreks skizzlez
I only play bass, mandolin and guitar
although now that I have a 12 string mandolin has become somewhat redundant
Bass, Guitah, and drums 4 me so far
and then wrek made a dickbutt
mandolin is a hipster instrument :p
I'm learning harmonica atm
so I can be all Bob Dylan-y
lol awesome
dog whistles are hipster instruments
triangle is ultimate hipster instrument
/me would love to learn banjo
ugh dog whistles
so I take it Wrek is speed drawing?
ScootaChicken_ AW yeah <3
Fleur: Now that's interesting! :3
the electric triangle is best instrument
triangle players unite!
banjo = best stringed instrument (after violin ofcourse)
Fleur banjo is easy if you're hyper
or drunk
:>
ys
yes*
true
MOONSHINE.
i remember sitting outside the music room at my old school playing "Imagine" on banjo
fuck yer!
Imagine on banjo
mfw
Kazzoo is best hipster instrument
MFWB
it sounded good
mfw I have no face
slenderman???
atlest you have a knee
broomstick, bucket with a hole, and some string.
what Dashie_Dashie
that is best instrument
yus
/me shoots arrowtobroknee in the knee with an AXE!
washboard
sounds like a butter churner
I just learned how to play
*falls down and dies*
Two sticks clanging together = best instrument
blowing on a bottle
washboard <3
I just learnt how to play the desk
/me plays the spoons
^
y did u do that Fleur he wasnt doing anything
*respawns*
DEM SPOONS
for speed drawing, this is pretty sick o.o
Feel the rhythm with your haaaands speak the rhythm while you can SPOONMAAAN
Vuvuzela is worst instrument
WREK R PRO
I'm taking bets on pony in pic
is that a pony or a wolf in the pic?
LadyCanary, Soundgarden <3
same here HMD
hmmm...
Black Hole Sun ftw
I wonder what gave that away
Wrek drawing wolves :|
wolf under full moon
Really? Of course he's drawing a pony
he is drawing a pony see?
I see a hoove
no wolf.
dun dun dun~
LadyCanary, do you like Alice in Chains?
/me hugs LadyCanary and ScootaChicken_ for Soundgarden
dat bass
ScottaChicken_ Indeed I do!!
I say twi
I say...
flutter
celestia or luna
screw the pony, that landscape looks awesome
IIIIIIII'm the maaaaaaaan in the bawks
It's obviously Gilda, stop kidding guys
In fact, I sung a part of Would? To Saxy in school, ScootaChicken_
to small to be either honestly :o
lol
It might be Lyra... or any pony. You know. *shrug*
now place your bets
moon or sun
it's rarities cat
^
this
thats awesome LadyCanary : D
I'm voting it's Twilight.
I vote for Fluttershy
yesh
hello... I think its rarity
sound died?
oh
new song
Im voting that I dont really care. Wrek is drawing a pony and no matter who it is, it will be awesome.
OH
LadyCanary, once I performed an acoustic version of Rooster in school assembly
I like this one!
it was terrifying ;_;
GOOD choice
well that should be obvious
That's AWESOME ScootaChicken_ heh, Chicken, rooster.
dohoho
dodo
lol I wish I could draw like this...
05anotehr fav song of mine

05ill tell in a bit

you know, except everything StickySyrup
s
all you do is take a cup of coffee and add it tomix
Hrm.
caffine coma? git ready!
Beautiful landscape
^
actually no.... I bet its rainbow dash
my bets on fluttershy
and nopony has guessed yet...
It's a sun
close
My bet is on whoever Wrek feels like
does anyone actually know
you're not playing the game right Fleur
lawl
I cant hear the song so I want to know what it is. I want to listen to it later
y u no hear song?

the headless horse!!!!
applejack o'lanturn

it's not the size of the wings that matters, it's what you do with em that counts
wings might be on the sides
also true
and creature was gone
apperantly
the pony is a lie
lol
TIS A LIE!!
this is driving me crazy...
I think this is fun
all the ponies in this room are crazy
those mountains are making me think of bob ross
but I've been up for 24 plus hours
ur crazy.......
same here HMD
/me hugs Lulu~
what if its like... applebloom
it's making me think of "At the mountains of madness" for some reason
then it's win
cause it looks quite small... could be a fily
07,01WHO was looking for ME?

Wrek: you sir, are talented.

StickySyrup, I have something that might interest you...
ScootaChicken: really? im listening
beating?...heavens no a stern talking too and a cake with icing that explains the wrongness of the situation should rectify the situation
Hey, im back! :) what is this were watching?
StickySyrup: http://ukofequestria.co.uk/ bam, its a meetup organiser for UK Bronies that a friend of mine organises, there's already been one very successful one and there's a pub meet in February

That is amazing! What program is this??

Axel Rudi Pell

Dreaming Dead
I think the music is the Easter egg
There we go! Thanks, HeavyMetalDash!

Wrek who was dat last band?
It depends on the teacher. Ten Minutes for instructor, 15 for Professor, 20 for Doctor
true.. its 45 minuts for chef
they always forget
We just have normal teachers, and they aren't even that good.
Kammerjunk: what class r u taking?
I'm just 15. In Denmark, that's still the first step of school.
Oh nice story RAWRity ~
And THEN off to high school.
Kammerjunk: =(... wait... what time is it in denmark.. surely u cant still be in school now
Nyria: you read teh first 2 right?
StickySyrup: Oh no. I meant in general.
they are just as awesome
RAWRity: I did~
Kammerjunk: ooooh ok.. lol, bit late for class
Yeah, it's 9:40 PM or something.
I told you all I'd make ShizuxVi sad!
it's 8:41 in the UK
PM
RAWRity: I read the first two lines.
Then I realised I couldn't do this.
Kammerjunk: why?
I am not good with sad stories.
Kammerjunk: well, technically it's not really sad.
my little dashie?
why?!!??
/me cries
HeavyMetalDash: what u crying for?
what about bubbles?
arrowtobroknee: I laughed, I cried.
I nearly died.
The pain, the pleasure, in equal measure,.
/me huggles Kammerjunk
the story jus to sad RAWRity
Wait what?~
/me huggles Natleyn.
/me still has yet to read mld, read a similar one, but didnt have that extreme emotional effect i've heard so much about
for me anyways
/me doesn't find MLD very sad.
00,10rawr
/me hugs Sumica
Sumica: yesh?
RAWRity: Then you are a stronger pony than I.
http://mlpf.im/sonicb00m
Sumica angry!
in the park
Oh hi, Sumica.
/me runs
your strength is amazing
I am in awe
arrowtobroknee: Oh, right, the park.
doesn't help that it's about my fave of the mane 6
00,10So what's up?
Sumica! :D
Well, I finished what I had to work on and realised that I have plenty of time left.
So that's nice.
Hi Sumica c:
It all just felt very, very manipulative. Like the guy wasn't just trying to write a story that happened to be sad, he was trying really, really hard to hit every emotional heart string he could to get people to cry.
The chat~
right in the childhood
/me sheds a single tear~
aww is the stream over?
I never noticed it was on.
Nah, he's just AFK~
true your point is valid but questioning the integrity of any author could bring any story into question
The worst thing you can do for me when you're writing something is to try to manipulate me. If the story you have is really that powerful, it will affect me without you adding tons of dramatic narration.
whats your fave story RAWRity?
The entire time I felt like I was listening to a particularly verbose La Dispute song.
HeavyMetalDash: favorite story? well, my favorite book is House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski, but that's more for the writing style and the over all tone of the book rather than the story itself.
hello im back
0,14Ahhh, House of Leaves
I'll have to read it sometime
0,14...I should REALLY read that one day
SaxyPretender: it's very good, if slow to start off.
0,14yep, I've heard all about it, and it's very shenanigany style
Once the crazy shit starts happenning with the format, it picks up.
0,14I was looking it up on TVTropes
0,14and I had Adblock enabled
I was more of a poetry man myself
/me doesn't use TVTropes~
0,14when all of a sudden, I see an ad asking me if I wanted to look for a new apartment
lolz
HeavyMetalDash: poetry? then look up "Only Revolutions"
...Well, DO YOU SaxyPretender? xD
0,14eeenope XD
it's by the guy who wrote House Of Leaves, and it's 2 parralel stories told in narrative poems.
Magic ~
/me dances around after checking his weight
This is what House of Leaves looks like during the middle section of the story: http://contemplatrix.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/mw1_danielewski.jpg

Oh really?~

Hello The_Master_of_War

Everybody's dead, Dave.
RAWRity: Oh, I'm sure dari will be thrilled to hear that.
0,14indeed

But Matt Smith has a fez. I like fezes, fezes are cool.
...then ponify
The_Master_of_War: Tennant has the Fury of the Timelord.

hmmm.........
I already have some designs in development
/me goes revive Nyria's chat >.>
i is an unicorn, cause unicorns is best
It worked Starflash ~!
Midnight_Tempest: unicorns are glass cannons
Wrek: do u need a cutie mark idea?
The chat is fine now~
Nice. XD
RAWRity: how so?
Dat question mark o.O
05depends on if sumica want her
Midnight_Tempest: powerful magic, but can't tae a hit to save their life.
05Shizuka*
Pegasi pwn
^
agree
eeyup
13if... i... okay <33
mucho amo
Isnt Sumica OC also a pegasus?
(much love)
/me 13gets her ornament
05oki then Shizuka, got a CM for her?
08,14das ist Shizu? <3
RAWRity: hmm... damn... i'll still take it though, im better support than a fighter anyway :$
Oh... I need to get some work done~ So I'm going to just hover over the chat~
Derpyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
: D
x_x

i rly like your music style *.*<3
Im goin to bed nao~ too tired~

0,14later Starflash
ok see ya Starflash

ohai SaxyPretender.
Nighty night Strflash
bb starflash
0,14oh hai DashWithRainbows!
Awww...
/me hugs everypony~~
hey DashWithRainbows
Night Starflash :(
/me GROUP HUG?
05my music is 99% my mood
/me hugs Starflash ~
Good luck @ work~
13i like it, very relaxed~
Wrek is in jazzy mood?
Pegasi, on the other hand, had manuverability and speed, and a decent defense, but burn out very quickly. If you look, you'll notice that all the runners after the Running of the Leaves that are exhausted are Pegasi.
Rage.. is the 1%
also, FLuttershy is exhausted after the chase scene in the latest episode.
<3_<3 who is this pony on screen
she's fast as RD though...
RD isn't
dat flank
"7/10. I liked the unicorns. They have some nice characters..."
true.. but thats fluttershy
Good afternoon everyone :)
13well.. it's also fluttershy, probably doesn't zoom as much as rainbow dash or other pegasi
Hihi TOY_PON3
Rainbow Dash, through her training, has managed to build endurance, but most of the others are not
ohey TOY_PON3
Hey TOY_PON3
hello TOY
dat TOY_PON3
13mfw superbrony hasn't seen his cameo in the latest bread :P
who's streaming right now?
wrek
Wrek
oh okay
alright I have to go. Be back in a few hours or so.
Pegasi also seem to have trouble maneuvering at high speeds, such as how they were defeated by Spike in Secret to My Excess.
>Nephew says he has to go home >come on laptop >get comfortable, put in earphones to get in drawing mood >he comes back...
so quiet..
Dat flank
Earth Ponies, at least the ones we've seen, are somewhat lacking in huge offensive power, but have the endurance and defense to be a proper Tank.
I had a bad day today..I failed my trig test.. :(
0,14later Yah...aww he left
They rely on baked goods
so class wise how would you define the three races?
TOY_PON3: nothing a bit of MLP cant fix?
/me rolls a dice to see how good this day will be...1...
pegasai are scouting classes
also with dodge
Unicorns are, obviously, your wizards and healers. Strong offensively, but keep them in the back casting spells so as to avoid getting chewed up.
13take 20 nyria, you have a class modifier of +9000 when you dualclassed Pony
/me flips three tables. Capcooooooooooooooooom
05does that CM suffice Shizuka?
makes sence
13<3
13i like :3
yeah but I need to take it easy from bronystate so i can study more and get better test scores :'(
there we go,
earth ponies are knights, large strength (and presumably HP)
/me takes the 20~
Pegasi work more as your fast attackers, perhaps rogues.
morning #bronystate
morning
13morning phase
Hey Phase4 `
Hihi Phase4
~
hi Phase4
hey Phase4
0,14oh hey Phase4
RAWRity: but unicorns could also weild both good offencive and defencive
I come back from a stressful's day at school and What do I see?
dis pony is looking right at me... at my SOUL! i like it o///o <3
13>.O
/me sighs and lays his head down
...
StickySyrup: they can make good support, certainly, but as for sticking them in the front of the party? Not a good idea.
Ima make a rarity inspired D&D char now
unicorns, with decent armour could be pallys
^
05hey arrow
why so glum, chum *pokes TOY_PON3*
My freinds and compatriots flirting with a non-canon poni
RAWRity: They would lack in physical strength, but their wisdom would make up for it
So Wrek, who ya drawin' today?
I was so damn careless..to think I would get every question right...I missed 7 out of 21
05armored pegasi are awesome
ohai room I probably shouldn't be in... >>
Then the guy tells me: Oh Jovanni you don't know shit.
13oh my... he looks... strong...
woah... that sucks TOY_PON3
That made me feel worse..
StickySyrup: yes, but their defense is very low. Glass jaws on all of em. Either they're in the front and have to keep up defensive spells just to avoid getting killed, or they're in teh back caster larger attacks and/or buffs on other players.
aaaawwww yeeeaaaa
TOY_PON3: Haters gunna hate!
Yes my first name is Jovanni...
Dont worry, TOY_PON3. As long as you did you best. There will be other times.
stupid close button
05and yes Midnight_Tempest, Shizuka is a really attractive young mare.
Ah, so you didn't draw the li'l filly you me and otakon made up?
/me 13blushes
RAWRity: they are a valuable asset true, but I believe they could, in numbers, use magic to overcome more than an earth pony or pegasus
also, if it's any consolation, Trig is essentially useless in real life.
the pic is amazing... so jelly
so I'm baaaaack for like 10 minues >.>
probably less than that mind you
hello scoot
ScootaChicken: cant get enough of us ey
13quick, everyone give their internets to scootachicken!
Hey ScootaChicken ~
Shizuka looks so pweety. :3
heya Scoot
StickySyrup: in numbers, perhaps, but unless you've got an entire party of high level Unis, they're kinda trotting on thin ice.
and still..but I was careless...I need to study more. So I am going to not get on Bronystate so much but I'll still get on in the mornings, when Im done with homework and studying, and on weekends
/me receives internets
hey scoot.
/me gives ScootaChicken his spare internetz
/me gives all of his internets to ScootaChicken ~
ScootaChicken!
/me hug
/me 's internet level is reaching 9000
lol
just... a few... mooooore...
nnnnoope
TOY_PON3: Whatever you have to do. You can do it. Do your best~
RAWRity: what is princess celestia? Is she a cross of all 3?
StickySyrup: she's the final boss.
she's an alicorn, so yes
pshoooof
Thanks LadyCanary :)
we believe in you TOY_PON3
No trouble at all ^_^
RAWRity: thats Luna
Celestia is epic lvl.
/me tries to hand Scoota an internet but it slips out of my hand and falls into a grate
but I still hate being in high school >.> atleast it's my last year
TOY_PON3: dont worry about it... You are still better at trig. then me by a long way
StickySyrup: no, Luna is the Miniboss you ahve to beat to awaken Celestia
lawl^
and thanks Midnight_Tempest and StickySyrup
RAWRity: why dont we just make the game now?
Celestia can cast meteor and waste only 1 mana point
0,14TOY_PON3, chin up! Things will get better, just go for it!
StinkomanFan: be more carefull please, internets are a prick to get out of carpeting
Celestia is the Kerafyn the Sleeper of Equestria Online
/me hugs TOY_PON3 ~
:) Yeah you're right. i still have all of you. Im sure that's enough support
05perhaps not what you originally had in mind shi, but i hope it suffices ^_^
*Kerafyrm
/me joins in on the hug
TOY_PON3, what happened? :(
/me hugs everypony
13>3
13er <3
>:3
Shizuka, it looks like an angry :3 face
Shizuka is greater than the number 3 ~
Just failed a quiz and was a bit upset
:(
man, if only i could draw like this... i so want my OC to look epic like this
0,14dat Shizuka pony, so awesome /)^3^(\
and then Shizuka was 42
ohai SaxyPretender
Also, Shizuka's looking FABULOUS~
Like I said TOY_PON3. Do what you've gotta do. You can do it! We belieeeeeve
dat SaxyPretender
But I'm fine now ScootaChicken :)
0,14...I've been here ;n;
/me 13turns red~
Fellow Bronys, assemble. Form of: Reassurance
Yay! :)
/me hugs Shizuka 'pretty filly!'
Wanna talk about poni?
/me hugs TOY_PON3
And btw Shizuka you are beautiful :3
0,14also, oh hai Phase4 and ScootaChicken XD
/me still hugging ScootaChicken
/me hugs ScootaChicken back
/me no homo
ALL the homo.
I really want to deploy one of those hug bombs that Altair used to drop...
ALL of the homo!
well i've got some code to work on, ding me if you want me
lalwl
ok
I miss Altair...
0,14also, why do companies think that gaming based reality shows are good?
SaxyPretender: I know right!!!
guys, has anyone seen Altair lately?
SaxyPretender: those esist?
0,14eeyup
They have those SaxyPretender ?~
SaxyPretender: examples?
because they just want to make a quick buck SaxyPretender.
0,14There was "The Ultimate Gamer" sponsored by WCG
0,14and "The Tester"
So a reverse gender Shizuka is flirting with us
cause they are run by retards and meant to attracted those same types of mentally deficient peoplez
DashWithRainbows just answered the question of most things in life
SaxyPretender: they could be good, but considering normal reality shows
13reverse? wat
SaxyPretender: dont forget the 'Lost' Video game... seriously
do you mean E-sports?
It's really dumb SaxyPretender
13es ist not R63~
I think Shizuka is a girl...
0,14I saw both seasons of TGU, and my qualm about it was that it focused more on the drama and personal lives of the gamers
lol
0,14over you know, THE GAMES, for the most part
It's difficult to tell if someone is a colt or a filly online
Just saying
13pink text
Seriously...
SaxyPretender: personal lives? of gamers?
unless openly stated
thats tv people want to see?
StinkomanFan, the pink and name probably should have tipped you off...
on the internet, no one knows you are a dog
dat text
Shizuka's a girl name?
well obviously
many men are wearing pink where i live atm
pink text look purple on black backdrop needs to be moar hot pink to stand out
everything is a girls name
although actually thats probably hypocrisy, given that if I ever become a mod I'll probably use purple text
but purple on orange
lol... they think WE are weird... watching a show that has a good plot, amazing character development, entertaining, and has good morals?
like Scootaloo
I just thought it was a very effeminate male
indeed - it's been a running joke amongst my friends for me to paint my cars hot pink in racing games
0,14and Capcom JUST announced that they're hosting a live week-long reality show/tournament for Street Fighter x Tekken
SaxyPretender want?
Um okay
best pic for best pony

What's the difference between Chemistry and cooking? In Chemistry, you should never lick the spoon.
soon I plan to draw on the comp like Wrek
lol
it's gunna be so metal
Where do you learn the basic of drawing them?

Guess ll just get some pony pics and copy them until i understand the ways to draw them
hmm... ok Wrek, lemme just find it
