As far as I'm concerned, the outcome of the Secret Santa game is that I gifted someone the Deus Ex collection, and I didn't really get anything meaningful in return.
KrazyNoobs, lol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVTmRHXuDnU thats what i want after raise this barn
:F
ouo: THAT'S RACIST!!!!
all barns a lilttle bit racist c:
ouo, no they aren't.
Let's raise this racist barn
ouo: Yeah, African slaves forced to leave their homeland and work at farms were kept in barns. Perhaps that's where barns get it from?
brb adding some funds to my psn
KrazyNoobs, no. It's just a stupid mondegreen, and nothing more.

has luna on it :D
ouo: Also, in Fiji, trespassors to the island, such as different races (about 80 years ago) would capture them and keep them in the barn, then cooking them afterward and eating them (FIJI barns were not the classic design, they were referred to as barns, they are just small buildings made of metal.
08,01MERRY EFFING FESTIVUS EVERYPONY!

luna will be on the month of september!

Next year, I should do a pony theme with XMas lights
08,01my boyfriend started talking to me again! \o/
what did he say?
It was getting lonely without admin... also, Zalgo occured.
As I said before, I spent 80 minutes on trying to make art out of Zalgo, and just made something creepy.
KrazyNoobs: yes

And all other countries in the timezone that celebrate Xmas.
I can’t stop watching “Raise This Barn” Help me!:[

Racism and barns

cachi01: Correct.

08,01with "Io" proncounced "yo"
08,01aniderp|bestfruitcak: his internet was buggered and he kept putting off talking to me
08,01still don't *quite* believe him
08,01though i don't think he completely gets what he put me through
i thought you tried to call him..
08,01apparently, he's "rubbish at answering [his] phone"
i think its an earthbound joke
08,01DerpyMuffins: moths
Moths?
he lieks moths
08,01i like moths.
Heh
08,01they're huge, colourful, silkmoths

aturnalia is a festival of light leading to the winter solstice, with the abundant presence of candles symbolizing the quest for knowledge and truth.[5] The renewal of light and the coming of the new year was celebrated in the later Roman Empire at the Dies Natalis of Sol Invictus, the "Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun," on December 25.[6]
Used to?
08,01and my furry character's species was a comet moth
http://i1.minus.com/ibdPBpWzipIRep.jpg
08,01and it just stuck
yay
cachi01, if you're wanting to see steam games for $2.55 or less, be sure to keep an eye out for games that are normally $9.99 or less and watch them on the sale like a hawk. You never know when one of them might go -75%
08,01http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argema_mittrei_01.JPG <-- a comet moth
Kandarihu: true dat. i'll be checking the indie section
08,01fluffle: so what you should be saying today is "felix diem natalis sol invictus!"
08,01because today is the Birthday of the Unconquerable Sun
oh great audiosurf is just 2.50 =D
felix diem natalis sol invictus
Good thing Phase4 doesn't have any kids http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1356446772140.jpg
08,01i want kids :(
dat 4chan leech
I'm back, my internet disconnected for 5 mins
that sucks
any idea why it disconnected?
08,01CrystalPhoenix: i had my first computer when i was 4. it was an Intertec Superbrain made in 1979 that didn't have a graphical interface at all, and ran CP/M as an operating system
08,01i learned to program wehn i was 8
Who here has read Season 3 Episode 11 Description (DONT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT, JUST WONDERING. No spoilers here, please)
so
where the fuck cider truck was?
I learned C++ when I was 12, but 8 years of age? That's amazing!
i can count to potato

08,01KrazyNoobs: QBASIC
:D
challenge accepted
08,01when i was 12, i learned Python and C
08,01KrazyNoobs: a bit, but not as powerful/visual
happy xmas DocSane :)
08,01bear in mind that at this point, i still used a CLI-only based system
I was bored, so I drew Santa http://imgur.com/vsUps
Visual Basic 6.0, I started to learn when I was around 10, but I never got too much into it. I played around with it a bit, but I couldn't actually consider myself an expert at it (at the time)
I learned and loved C++ at 12.
i learned a potato
Saintuhg Kluoz pls
But yeah, I always have Visual Basic 6.0 pinned to my task bar, so that if I needed to write any small programs to solve a problem (math, duh), it would be easily accessible.
eeyup
Really easy to write small programs in with power, but if it is just something simple with math that would take forever to write on paper, I use Python.

Right
Sorry about that

I got a coloring book ouo

That would be awesome to get a plushie of your oc
i also got two rainbow dash plushies
Lol lucky

No one know i like mlp so i got nothing
WindWyr: here in mexico we get some awesome quality plushies for ust 20 dollars :)
just*
Wow
I saw plushies at walmart the otherday.
eww official plushies
I never see them anywhere
they quality wasn't that great.
Except online
In Britain, all you get is colouring books and blind bags
i also got a box with vinyl scratch on it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ2UWzsm3pc exclusive to walmart.
i got a bag with rainbow dash and derpy
I got a rock.
lol
you got tom?
I got spaghetti.
http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/188691_10151196863361840_1303346696_n.jpg
i also got a derpy toy!
That's cool
thats awesome.
when i got the bag and the derpy toy i was squealing with delight! lol
Well the only pony merchandise I've seen in my country so far was a coloring book in a store.
ive seen some stuff at hot topic. They had rainbow dash socks with individual toes
I saw that rainbow Dash hoodie.

Kids are spoiled.....
^
brb playing the unfinished swan :3
Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold:P
DerpyMuffins Wut? i'm 18. I got the money to buy it. Yet i was tricked by my mom who bought it instead of me doing it myself cause i wanted a new one.
I said KIDS were spoiled
Aaaah
I also got Regular Show toys
They're not all spoiled...
I'm expected to get my little sister something......
I don't know what to get her
A lot of them are though, yeah...
DerpyMuffins I know the feel. I was forced to buy things and all that.
Yea, but I want to get her something nice
golly
It's a Wonderful life?
it felt....odd
I hate figuring out what everyone in my family wants. Absolutely none of us ever know what we want. XD
^
That's like my family xD
I'd hate to do this...
GilDash That's why i usually say to just make it so easy and simple. Give me money then i can use it on things i may end up wanting or needing at some point. Instead of taking a shot at just buying something of a either low medium or high price that can backfire which i just don't need.
That's why I love Chinese new years
All you get is money
killerpony7733: That's what I say as well to make it simple for people. Chances are I won't even spend it until later anyway (I've actually got money from 3 years ago still saved). The problem is, not everyone agrees with giving money as a gift.
I'd want money for a gift
To be honest, I'm happy with anything you give me. Even joke presents can be quite funny sometimes. :D
GilDash Yeah but most in the family does not agree and insist on being stubborn and having to use alot of money on things that i may not need or want. My dad knows this and has given me actual money with the note attached saying he wants me to use it well. My dad understands me but the rest of the family? nope
If everyone gave each other money; everyone would just about break even. XD
I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.
Who wants money when you can get a http://www.amazon.com/ThinkGeek-USB-Pet-Rock/dp/B003DOD0TI
I'd put the money in an elaborate puzzle box. Tehehe
killerpony7733: I know, right? I'd rather someone give me, say, a £10 rather than spend £30 on a huge gift for me. Honestly, sometimes I prefer the smaller gifts anyway.
lol unicorn meat http://www.amazon.com/ThinkGeek-Canned-Unicorn-Meat/dp/B004CRYE2C/ref=pd_sim_t_1
:'(
I really only got one joke pony gift this year.
Twilight nooo
I contacted the seller, they assured me it was a background unicorn.
DINKY NOOOOOO
GilDash Yep that too. But atleast though my big sister and mom bought a gift card with money for a game store which is honestly just as good tbh. But else i just try and keep pushing it saying it's stupid and i want to make it simple for them. But yeah it's a very pointless struggle alot of the time.
LYRA YOU WERE SO YOUNG!
Not too crazy about Sombra
Trixie meat.....
Hmmm
interesting thought...
killerpony7733: Problem I have with gift cards? You can only spend them in one place (I guarantee I can find it cheaper elsewhere). It has no real world value and can't be transferred (if there's nothing you want in that shop you can't get the money back). It will eventually expire (if you don't spend it in time it becomes worthless).
I sound like such an ass, debating presents. XD
Better than tech talk last night
GilDash Well the good ting is i always spend some money at that store anyway so i keep the said amount of time before expiring constantly reset :P
killerpony7733: That's fair enough. If you gave me a gift card for the local garden centre though... like, lulwat?
GilDash Yeah that would be silly.
You know... I can't think of a single thing I'd buy in a garden centre. Doesn't help that this house doesn't have any gardens...
how about a spade?
... Not going to help with concrete. XD
Maybe not.
Maybe I could buy a pressure hose? That's good for cleaning concrete, right?
A pressure hose?
YOu mean like a power washer?
Aye, like a power washer.
yeah, that a good idea.
Although this is all achedemic. I'm not going anywhere near a garden centre unless I can help it. XD
Does anyone else have issues withs steam going offline?
though with giftcards, getting it cheaper elsewhere isn't important, as it's free for you anyway, and you can get mall-wide giftcards
Then in that case you've got to go to a specific mall. Also, if we're going that way, money you get given is technically free to you as well.
yeah
and no not specific mall, it's cooperation thing-
can't remember what mine's called, but it's a list of various shops that take that type
like "This mall + these shops"
Not sure we have anything like that in the UK. Or, at least, I've not heard of it and never bothered checking.
I never heard about it until I got it
:)
almost always become chirstmas to me
I dunno... my mind just kind of becomes blank.
It's like I've really got to focus on typing that one word. XD
hehe
Is odd yeah
The fire of friendship lives in our heartsAs long as it burns we cannot drift apartThough quarrels arise, their numbers are fewLaughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)We are a circle of pony friendsA circle of friends we'll be to the very end
okey dokey all
jcelios: Is that from somewhere?
have to disconnect my monitor for travel
so I'll brb on ipod shortly
GilDash: From Hearth's Warming Eve episode :)
actually scratch that
I'll be leaving
otakon: See ya! :)
:)
goodbye, have fun
jcelios: I thought it might be.
I never got into that song, It was too hard to sing along-
whops
sorry

Hey everyone.
Hiya
Okay. Rarity can be best pony then.
Rarity is least understood pony.
Rarity is best mare
Oh I know right.
Indeed!
It's a contradiction -in order to be generous, she needs stuff to give.
yeah
So she must be acquisitive.
and she's very emotionally generous too
I don't have trouble seeing her element-
Sorry, I'm sure this was all discussed before I came in.
Vivix: Thats what i mean :D
You can certainly say that Rarity has earnt her namesake.
Double Rainboom teaser everyone
-or has been discussed to death since S1.E2. XD
Hehehe
True, the general consensus is fine now
Double Rainboom? What does it mean?
Randomnerd, first ever fan made episode based on MLP FiM
Oh god! O h man!
Oh, right
I-- probably won't watch it
I might
Thank you, CrystalPhoenix.
Eh, why not?
Rarely watch fandmade things
at least it'll be better than Dusk Dawn
urgh
I was being silly, but in truth, I didn't know what it was, so thanks.
that it will be
Whats the difference between the channels on bronystate?
just the chat, during certain events like episode stream
Twilight Chat is best chat
Vivix: Thnx!
That's what the promise. They delayed to early 2013 instead of this year's fall so we can at least assume it's going to be quality.
http://youtu.be/dYQTEW6GYU8
Fluttershy chat is best chat :D
for those curious about Sonic Rainboom
They're very talented animators, and I think it will be great, but I most likely won't see it
/me goes to war against Sundaysmile carrying a banner with three Butterflies on it.
and from what I've seen, the animation aren't as show accurate as the director claims it to be
/me waves Fluttershy banner
it's good, great even but still not exactly like the show
well they're all animation students, right?
the voice, I could get use to that
I want to know what the VAs are going to be like.
Vivix, I suppose so
the animators on mlp have very long experience
well, the seniors do
PURGE THE INFIDELS! That is.... if you don't mind....
Randomnerd's purge was succesful
downside: it killed the chat
lol
This is why we can't have nice things.

in a suggestive way
Good luck

last time I got blackandwhite instead of colour was ntsc vs pal etc
though that was over 10 years ago
08,01i've tried that, actually
08,01still didn't work
hm, I'm out of ideas
he could try streaming in antimatter instead of matter
It's the Queen!
well honestly, last time I got black and white without it being an issue, I was running and old xbox into my pedalboard and into a tv
digital tv cut the signal if I applied too much noise-

Isn't that the shitty cyborg mouse
It's lovely ;__;
That mouse is horrid
/me hugs it
Whoever made it should feel bad for coming up with such an ugly and horrible design.

/me huggles back :3
LOtR is always good
How's everyone doing?
and i could swear i've seen Dancing with the Stars here, a couple of minutes before
Pretty good
Dancing with stars is always difficult. You can manage only one step before you burn up.
This is the most silent I have ever seen Bronystate.
well it is chrsitmas
I was thinking about trying to come up with another challenge for Spyro. Do you think anyone cares about them anymore?
tfw I'm watching this at the exact same time on the exact same channel.
Film4 ftw
UK TV uber alles.
nice ScootaChicken
I might if I had enough time for one
I watch the Extended edition about twice a year
Challenge?
Neo, http://www.spyroforum.com/forum-spyro-contests.html
I still need to finish watching all of them, but procastionation -_-
dafuq
Why is the forum still open?
because I didn't have time to draw anything
k
I'm kind of sad about it actually
but oh well
Next year I won't have finals and stuff anymore at this time of year
so hopefully it'll happen
You're sad that no one does them anymore?
Unless I get kicked out for being too old by then
:P
watch the extended version RotK with the actor's commentary on tis hilarious
ANYTHING.
ANYTH-ohai emangamer
lel
ScootaChicken her PC blew up
Anything you say
ScootaChicken seriously, it broke since than she couldn't be able to be here
then*
Lil_B: Yeah I know, I just felt like taking the oppurtunity to bust out an in joke.
oh :(
O U so silleh.
ScootaChicken you mean that Vivi is best Pony? :3
No she's not.
Splash zone is best pony.
Also, #jezuzbday2k12yolo
Ayo.
just a tradition
my birthday
so people would spend time with their families instead of posting on forums
Merry Xmas to all!
yo Sundaysmile ScootaChicken emangamer!
And good evening too all
hi Sundaysmile :)
ah ok
we've been doing it since like what, '08?
I think '08
Hello Sundaysmile
Is it insane coincidence that my tv has this playing in the other room?
he's streaming from tv
Hey bronies/ponies! :) Merry Xmas!
so...anyone read any good books lately, trying to get something on itunes, and it's ben awhile since I read anything
Saruman is like I hate when he does that
they sell books on itunes?
that makes me feel less paranoid, thanks Vivix
It was a 3 year tradition
Nice
a wild ad appears
every single time we have a get together he calls the eagles so he can leave
AH GOD
FURBY! KILL IT!
SirGanjalf: Get adblock +
Can't ride a horse out like a normal wizard
thelonecubone: i meant TV ad
SirGanjalf: oh, :P
thelonecubone - you should be seeing ads too.....
well, i'm not looking at stream atm
helping someone atm
dawwww
/me wishes they had adblock+ for tv
but that's where tv stations get their money from
that and the companies who pay them to host their shows....
what
no other way around
tv pays for the ability to air shows
well depends on the show :P
unless the show is made by them, then they pay the staff who made it
commercials pay to get on tv
must've been '07 then
So if I say that i have a show to air, they'll air it?
DISASTER YOUR TEARING ME APART
Because I drew 3 pictures
And one got reused one year
no, but if it's a show they believe in, believe in your pitch
they'll buy it
Forgot to do the electricity
wat was that
and the forum was founded in '06
merry xmas ravebrony
so that's every year except first that we've done it
aw :(
have a good one so far?
Sundaysmile basicly, if they think that you make a Show, that will get people to watch their Channel so they can get advertising money, because componies know that a lot of people watch this channel, than they will buy your Show you offer them
BILBO!
Sundaysmile: You bet! :3
Dark92Enigma: :$
I feel educated for someone who doesn't watch tv now
thank you bronystate
I'm not sure how a tv show generates profit though, I think that's merchendise isn't it?
they don't get admoney, right? Only staff pay and royalties?
I'd imagine they'd get a cut
but like you said
probably from advertising the merchandise
I'm not sure- I know simpsons get a rerun pay, and if you have origina lcharacter in that episode you get character pay or writer pay-
yeah
:o
What does TUS mean?
Woof
OH MY LORD OF THE RINGS
"Mario! Marioooooooo!" :P
yo Mike|Explosives

Bronysith: PS has no games.

Mike|Explosives: kill yourself

*when
SirGanjalf: It never has.
Also get Gravity Rush it is an excellent game.
I know this from playing it.
I really wonder if anyone knows what I'm talking about.
one does not simply <insert comment here> into Mordor
Take pie into Mordor
One does not simply dash through the snow into Mordor.
Which means no presents for Orcs:;(
*:'(
One does not simply trot into Mordor.
oh mai
One does not simply wear a hat into Mordor.
One must ROCK \m/ INTO MORDOR!
Where was Gondor when one didn't simply walk into Morder?
Jcelios: At that exact moment, a prog metal riff played in my head.
inb4 Gimli SMASH
Where was Gondor when Gimli broke his axe?
LOL
Gimli gives no fucks
he finds a bigger hammer and tries again
Where was drums in the deep when one does not simply precious?
apply magma
Gimli use Moljnir on it.
Not even Banhammer can destroy the Ring

hi stream
hi texasboykc09
how are you cachi01
I've heard the Hobbit is an awesome film. Gotta watch it
texasboykc09: lol
oh cool, have you played them yet?
Dark92Enigma: it is :3
I've played Nintendo Land, it's not bad
The games are better than the Wii Sports games the first Wii had
I should hope so :P
In The Fellowship of the Ring, both the novel and the film, Gandalf claimed to be the wielder of the Flame of Anor. Many people think this means the Elvish Ring of Power he has (Narya, the Ring of Fire), but many also wonder why he would reveal this secret to such a powerful enemy. No one knows what he really meant by the Flame of Anor.
Nintendo also made it a lot more internet orientated like the 360 and PS3
It is interesting to note that Minas Tirith was formerly known as Minas Anor, or "Tower of the Sun." This could suggest that the Flame of Anor is the light of the Sun - an ancient symbol of the one omnipotent being, Ilúvatar. As a Maia and a wizard charged with aiding the peoples of Middle Earth in the battle against evil, it's possible that Gandalf's powers are linked to the power of the sun and given by Ilúvatar himself. This seems
LOL
He is very sad about the cat
the more you know
woot IT crowd
welll... dat Psy
did you have to make an account
ello everyone
/me upgrades tea to LotR
I don't think I "had to"
hello soulrider95
but I did
you ar drunk gimli, go home
hi soulrider95
It actually divides userspaces into different logins, sort of like a computer with multiple users
go home frodo, you are high
So each person has a different save, differen't data, etc.
08,01Dark_Horst: you were truncated at "this seem", hun
that's what the PS3 does
We must sing you the doom song
yes gimli, you do
Not sure about the 360
chat needs more of something
Previous Wii had nothing like that though
oi aragorn speaks fancy
Yea
08,01chat needs more naked..
and you cannot get out
You could put some data in individual Miis, like Wii Sports statistics
Yeah that's what the ps3 does
Dark_Horst I just got a Bundeswher Ad...
But it doesn't let you do anything else
This seems supported by the fact that most of Gandalf's wizardly powers have something to do with blinding white light.
08,01naked germans are best germans.
there'S the rest
/me 08,01is slightly drunk
xD
Lil_B: I want you to go streaking in the streets then
The Wii U is much more like PSN actually
Lil_B: y u no adblock
but i think they might be trying to tell us something
lyrics drop
Dark_Horst I have Adhunter, but I just can't find the Block-Rules for U-Stream :(
weird
i installed adblock plus
08,01galadriel's a whore
cool
08,01galadriel's a whore
does everything by itself
13easylist
08,01la la la la la
didnt need any configuration
08,01galadriel's a whore
I heard that Nintendo announced something about the updates
They also got rid of the friend codes
/me 08,01slutshaming
Yea
The updates take forever to download
like supposedly they take forever right out of the box
Yea.
nice skirt, legolas
At least 2 hours
So if you bought it for someone as a gift you should unbox it, install the updates, and then repackage
Oh wow
08,01we're watching swan lake ehre
Dark92Enigma yes, Adblock does everything by Itself, Adhunter can do the same, except you have to find the Rules yourself :(
And that's just the main update
well hopefully they'll start packaging them with those updates preinstalled ._.
lets see, this is fellowship of the ring correct?
08,01my mother: "is he going for hunting?"
Dark_Horst: Have you read DM of the Rings?
08,01my brother: "not in those tights he's not"
There are other smaller updates when you run the channels that take a few minutes
Conyst: dont think i have
I should see if it will run Gamecube games
fun-Trivia, IE 9 has something Similar as Adblock Plus Implemented, Easylist is available for this too, just look through the Options and enjoy Ad-free IE9
I thought it couldnt
ewwwww IE
It's supposedly backwards compatible with the Wii, and there is a Wii menu available.
since theres no way to plugin your controllers
Yea
That's what I'm wondering about
08,01Dark_Horst: i was talking about Swan Lake, which is a ballet
it really sucks
ah
08,01so they're all wearing tights
My Wii is pretty much just used as a Gamecube
:P
still not getting the hunting
08,01that's what we're watching here
IE nuke it from orbit for it is the only way to be sure
08,01Dark_Horst: he's got a crossbow
I think you can get downloadable gamecube games though, so that's nice
he does?
didnt see that
IE9 is not that bad, a lot of you never gave it a chance anyway so STFU
08,01Dark_Horst: because you're watching lord of the rings...
Can finally purchase the gamecube games I've never had :P
aaaaah
now its clear
08,01finally.
08,01:P
/me 08,01loves ballet
seriously?
08,01so many hot guys in tight tights
I gave IE a chance then I came to my senses and got back on Chrome
08,01nice... tight... buttockses...
I think so
I have a Classmate who looks exactly like Frodo... it's unbelievable... He has the Nickname "Gollum" in our Class however
Thats pretty cool if they really are doing that, but I would still prefer the physical game
WAT
wat
Well yea
If you already have it there's no point in getting another
I love this new keyboard :)
ShizuKlaus thanks for mentioning easylist... I found the right Filter rules in their txt File :D
08,01my mother: "is she a swan?"
But it's not like you can go to your local Gamestop and pick up Kirby Air Ride anymore
08,01my brother: "no, she's a dancer"
Kirby Air Ride <3
Love that game
City Trial
That's the only part of the game anyone I know plays
bbl
Yes
Got hours of play time out of that with my brother
We never play Top Ride though
we got pretty ridiculously competitive
Never enjoyed it
that mode was alright
City Trial is obviously the best though
rarity
o.O
Even just the free run was fun
Smash Bros Melee -> Confirmed for download
You can just drive around and tried to kill each other
Wind Waker -> Confirmed for download
Super Mario Sunshine -> Confirmed for Download
Metroid Prime -> Confirmed for download
Mario Sunshine was another great game
I don't know why everyone hated it :(
What?
I know no one who hates it
So long everyone.
I guess everyone was all like
"It's not like real Mario because there's voice acting and no Goombas"
=/
expostion
Bye con-damn it :I
OF MANY COLORS
I always wished they would make a sequel
god the internet here is so shitty
But I'm not up to date on Nintendo consoles anymore, so I'd never get to play it
so are we only watching fellowship tonight or all of them
08,01Unnr: Swan Lake
Now
I wonder how long it will take for people to make a Wii emulator
Lil_B: i've noticed you pinged me. you were talking to Dark_Horst
i hope the sad one
Dark92Enigma that must have been further back ... btw, hello :)
cachi01: but even the sad endings vary
so what did you fet Dark92Enigma
hello Lil_B that was like 10 minutes ago
alexxm what did i felt?
Unnr THEN THE SADDEST OF THEM ALL
Its like Clue, so many potential endings
or how do i feel?
cachi01: the one where the villian wins and suicide?
those orcs run fast
alexxm|colt: OH
alexxm|colt: what did i get
Unnr yep
caught up to them in a matter of hours
actually that was the only ending i knew
one where she commits suicide
stop in the name of love
pretty good
08,01x/win 14
full of food and drink
cachi01: there are several variations on that, including one where the suicide breaks the spell, the prince joins her, and several other variations
DerpyMuffins: pretty good. Got a new keyboard and mouse
i wonder if my pc can handle half life
alexxm well, i got two DVD's of Hulk VS Thor/Wolverine and a new t-shirt, a PC mouse so far /still, no Twi plushie
so far¨*
or Avengers DVD
cool Dark92Enigma
You'd be surprised at how fast people can do things
Dark92Enigma: no estoy seguro si hacen envios a chile pero puedes preguntar :) http://www.facebook.com/OkashiStoreMexico
hello?
testing
Hiiii
a+
Ok, sorry my Adobe derped on me
good thing, i have Google Chrome
I never got a chance to play Kirby Air Ride :(
23ll, that didn't work, let's try again
It wouldnt surprise me if the next Ipad in a few years can play Wii games via emulator
oh yeah, cachi01 have you ask them if it's possible if they could make Sumi's OC?
im pretty sure they can. but i havent asked them how much would it cost
ah
for example my oc costs 470 pesos
thats 40 dolalrs
dollars*
wait
i think sumi's would cost the same
maybe
I wonder when there will be a jailbreak for the Wii U
anypony has a pic of smui's oc?
i mean from the pony creator thing
what`that was a wierd song...

pony_891577 Suit yourself not my IP on the line luckily
Odd. I don't recognise the name... and there are rules, which you would be aware of had you been here for a year. I find your assertions... wanting.
Hi, and happy hearth's warming eve everypony!!
Hi Jinglebell_icybeauti :)
hi thelonecubone
Heya Jinglebell_icybeauti :)
and hi MLP_Brovakiin
I'm just gonna leave this here.. http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/12/keep-calm-and-flutter-on-synopsis.html
JESmith here. Testing using the chat on 3DS
pony_240994: No way, I just got one!
For some reason its not letting me switch my nick
Floris Ooooooh you getting banned son.
You're not even allowed to know the title in bronystate lol
Jinglebell_icybeauti: as soon as i get mine out of the thingy that i give my things and they give me money for them which i forgot its name. i'll give you my friend code
Why do we have to have idiots on today? Do they really have nothing better to do? (For that matter, why am I on? Hypocritical much? :D)
cachi01|afk: Okay, I'l make sure to write it down
GilDash Hey you aren't douchy atleast and all.
GilDash: You're not an idiot though :p
GilDash: that made my day
My parents also gave me this pony bag with rainbow dash and derpy on it, and inside, there was a mlp hoodie, luna shirt, headphones, and something else I forgot.
I try not to be douchy. Whether I succeed or not is another matter entirely. :D
I haven't gotten anything... yet. I'm a bit ill, so I had to beg off on the family get-together this year... but my sister in law is coming bylater with what loots I get at this late age.
Oh, and to pick up the gifts I have for the kids in the clan.
I got a toaster oven, some lotion, a new scarf, an alarm clock, and a wedding guestbook
My brother just downloaded Playstation all stars with the PSN card I gave him
we were just playing that
Since I am still young, I got a crapload. U jelly?
and now we're off to another relative's house, be back later :D
Not really. I've got nowhere to put things these days. :D
Yeah. At my age and pathetic health, all I really want is my old teeth back-- that's not happening any time soon.
GilDash also i hope that floris guy gets banned hard. Cause what he linked gave off spoilers to ep 11 which from what i can read though not name at all. Is VERY big for many
GilDash Seriously that was douchy as hell if i don't mind such spoilers.
Floris eh?
killerpony7733: Aye, he broke the rules hard on that one. Problem is he did a hit and run, so you'd have to have join/leave messages on to figure out who he was so you can set an ip ban up. If he's a hit and runner he probably wouldn't use the same username.
GilDash Best cause i can copy paste the line and give the proof away.
killerpony7733: ill tell the mods. he can be banned right here right now
dontchu worry, i got this
killerpony7733: I can as well. I've got his IP he logged in with and everything.
Really though i cannot express how douchy it is to link that page. Really it would ruin a awesome surprise.
as well as the fact that he broke the rules
It's not as though you're forced to click on the link though. The fact it gives the ep name away is kind of a spoiler warning as well.
one of they great things about seeing join/quits, you see there host so even if they bail they'e still screwed
Also, doesn't !cd give the episode name anyway?
Yes but that ep is first out jan 19th? i think
everyone who ops see join quit
GilDash: not a synopsis. the mods give the new ep name in their newsletter though
I read it earlier...Crap, no saying nothing...But it excited me slightly....-prepares for moon launch-
Vivix: not just ops
no, but everyone who does, do
anyone with a good client that can
so it's not something to worry about us catching it or not
everyone with any client can
Vivix: not lightIRC :p
I think you can on webclient too, not sure
Ajax is in lightirc, it does
Ajax ≠ lightIRC
in anyway
They're not bundled?
ok. thank goodness, i havent seen the leaked episodes
yeah !cd reveales name, which is kind of annoying to some of us-
GilDash: titles dont even count as spoilers as far as im concerned
though ignoring the bot would be easy, I'm too lazy

Playing cards? Bleedings?

steam lied to me
StinkomanFan missed it too :/
it wasnt 10 hours
StinkomanFan: it's alright
it was 20 minutes
silly steam
Lel
I wanted to order the Zelda Historica Book yesterday, but I found out that A Limited Edition Version comes in February... costs 30$ more but I'll take it!
i dont know why the new ep. aire today
cachi01: How much is for Old Half life anyway>
?*
thelonecubone: gb?
or wat?
Cost
and gb as well :P
idk i bought the complete pack lol
whats the difference with the limited edition
Zelda died for me after Wii :<
oh
and i think its 800 mb
but i wont install HL 1 in this pc
just opposing force
ekips: waaaaaaaaaaat
I tried the new Steam "Big Picture"-mode... it started in 1280x980 (or whatever the 16:9 resolution at 1290 is) and when I wanted to switch to 1920x1080 it told me that my Grafics card isn't good enough... thanks Steam finally someoine told me!
ekips: but....but it was epic D:
800 mb, not bad
thelonecubone: i think its 4.29
ekips a lot of people didn't liked Skyward Sword, and I, as a huge Zelda Fan, just fail to see why D:
^
oh, well :P
I don't know the content of the new Zelda games. But I don't like the gameplay
Game Grumps don't like it eather, but ... I have yet to hear any real arguments!
thelonecubone: i mean the price
Lil_B Maybe I don't like the new Zeldas because I don't like the Wii
ekips the Gameplay hasn't changed since OoC! You get around, interact with people, get to dungeans and solve them :/
cachi01: oh :$
lel
Gameplay wasn't the right word. I meant the whole dancing around to move thing
I want a proper controller and relax in my chair when I play a game like Zelda
ekips: wait till 2014
we r getting a new zelda
I already rage enough when I'm stuck in Zelda. Fiddling with the movements would only add to the rage
whats the new zelda called
we dont know yet
nintendo just said that they were releasing a new zelda in 2014
cachi01 with an "oldschool" controller?
ekips honestly you can just make simple wrist movements to trigger the sword movements or to aim in Skyward Sword
we just have to wait till E3 2013
btw, anyone here who knows a bit about building PCs?
ekips: well..... wii u gamepad, and i think the only thing you'll need to move is to aim with bow
Lil_B what a coincidence, I chose the parts I will order today for my new pc
but i hope they add wii u pro controller compability
Lil_B: http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png
^
cachi01 I just wanted to know the Wattage of my Power Supply for the componets I choose :P
oh lol
Lil_B bequiet! has a nice calculator for that
ekips thanks
http://www.bequiet.com/de/psucalculator/expert
If i built a PC, i'll try to aim for Superb or excellent
It's even in german :P
My PC will be a biest >.< after all I wanna Play Games, and make music, that means I can'tr cheap out on anything except the case...
Goodnight everyone ^-^

evening Punkie_Pue :)
Hi Punkie_Pue :)
whatd you all get?
A pro tip I can give when building PCs: Read the official data sheets on the company's website. Will give you much more compare possibilities
a shirt and a sweater ^w^
i7 CPU, 7800-7900 Seried ATI GPU, 16GB DDR3 RAM, good Motherboard, good Soundcard... :(
nice. I got an Amazon gift card and windows 8
ekips I heard that book is aawesome, but Im not much of a reader :P
Lil_B I'm not getting a soundcard yet. It's not worth it with my old headset :D
what can a high end sound card do that an onboard cant?
Lil_B I love reading, but haven't really read that much this year due to lacking time...Hoping to read more next year^^
not much of and audiophile
an
Punkie_Pue: you like windows 8?
ekips Soundcards aren't that Importand, but I wanna make music, and I like to hear it Chrystal Clear :/
cachi01 I don't :<
but I'm, not that much of an Adiophile that I need Gold-plated-everything xD
ekips: neither do i
The first thing you are asked by Windows 8 is to create an online account. wtf
and I miss Minesweeper/Solitaire/etc
ikr
cachi01 I do. I needed it for my new machine.
...........fakin selfish sony
ill bbl
I really hope that gaming on Linux will become more popular
wtf sony. atleast some discounts
ohai Wrek
ok, I need ~550W, I'll probably go with an 600W
hello Wrek
cachi01: atleast there was steam sale
hello Wrek
Lil_B be sure to get an 80 Plus certified
thelonecubone: yeah atleast valve is cool
cachi01: xbox is, Meh
but still worth it
meh atleast they give little discounts
Ohai Wrek
well........i got bioshock 2 for just 620 points >.>
ekips yeah, I really wanna safe energy :)
weeping_pegasi82: nice!
Lil_B getting a 80 Plus Platinum myself. It's my parent's power I'm using after all :D
brb
thx :)
ekips yeah, I'm spending enoudh time at the machine, and my Mother hates looking at the rising electic Bills, and my current PC probvably only has a 300W Power Suppy... she will notice the increase...
Lil_B maybe it's even going down with the new energy management technologies current hardware has

Kipkat07_Scarf: is your pc a built one?
0,5SST?
common sense really.
Kipkat07_Scarf: mine is only 31, half of which got deleted due to copyright
I kind of feel my brother wasted his money, the cord to plug it in doesnt screw on to the tv And one of the controller's buttons doesnt work
cachi01: Im building one
Im going to get my Skyrim hours in before midnight, See y'all tomorrow :) Goodnight
Bye Cypresswolf :)

Sonny: Do you want one of my whole face? :3
Kipkat07_Scarf: oh good. pls when u download any games to the one with windows 8 mind if u tell me how they run and the name of the laptop? cause building one is kinda expensive lol
I meowed at my cat and meowed back
I took quite a few XD
Probably went a bit overboard but oh well :3
I need to buy a webcam
So people can see my face
You dont say

TwilightSonata: Nice hair cut :)
Legendary: it can be used for other things .>

TwilightSonata: well, not really requesting it but nobody's stopping you :p you could take one but I'll be going in like a minute so xd

My hair is too short for me xD
http://i4.minus.com/iyq4psdRWhnAv.jpg here's one without the phone obscuring my face at any rate :3
I'm like, not wearing any makeup today and I'm wearing my dad's clothes so I probably look like a dude XD

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W2ayccqqIw&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
TwilightSonata: yeah, she had a similar thing with the haircut which made her look somewhat like a dude, and she wore a tie with a drawing of beer which convinced people she was a dude
I just bought my streaming software and installed it(contact me if u want to watch me fail)
twilight_sprinkle: Haha, sounds kinda like me XD
Was she pretty?
/me rolls on top of the chat
idunno

i mean
November was a GREAT month
venasaur
Charizard is over rated'
^
twilight_sprinkle: What do you mean by wasn't your type? :<
charizard has too many weaknesses
^
4x to rock
Charizard has aaaaaaaaaaaawesome stats though :3
Yeah but Charizard's a goddamn dragon so fuck stats and types I'll use him all the time.
I dont get people make charizard to be the best
Cubone can kick charizards ass
:>
Chikorita is my favourite pokemon
cubone is orphan lel
and its so CUTE
DID YOU JUST SAY ORPHAN?
Oh you picked a charizard? ROCKS
xbox? anyone?
*sniff*
yes
Good bye bronystate
TwilightSonata: well she didnt exactly put much effort into studying, i like at least somewhat hard-working people, but i didnt really know her well, she wasnt very open
See your rocks?
STREAMING TIAAAMEE
Bye The_Engineer :)
Look at my Dugtrio.
Now look at your rocks.
Now look at my Dugtrio.
TwilightSonata: but she was ok at least, never did anything bad from what i know
actually, his name was supposed to be orphaen or something like that
Rock typr move dummy
Now look at your ro- EARTHQUAKE
Oh my.
twilight_sprinkle: Ah, okay, I guess I'm kinda like that in some ways, although I'm pretty open with people ^_^
at least nothing too bad, a tie with a beer image Was against the rules
Pick a number
http://i.imgur.com/Jg1Jw.jpg ^w^
now add 5
I have a really bad tendency to coast in school though... ;A;
eleventy billion
now add 2
potato + 5 + 2
TwilightSonata: im somewhat shy irl, even more so with family friends, i felt shy as hell yesterday when my family was visiting friends :$
TwilightSonata: That's okay, I tend to graze through with little effort too.
cachi01: Dont be mean tot the potato :>
carrot?
to*
now you 7
Lets see what can murder Charizard.... Elec,Water,Rock
Reikim: Glad I'm not the only one haha xx
Funfact: in the pokemon manga, pokemons actually died
cachi01: orly?
I miss Derpy
damn
horrible
btw Reikim charizard isnt a dragon, hes fire-flying
ways to die
Yeah but I tend to coast with high marks anyway so meh.
but he looks cool, true
Charizard's a goddamn dragon.
cachi01: Get limbs riped?
thelonecubone: an arbok gets cut in half
D:
;~;
dayum
there are pokemon zombies
/me sits on teh chat
Looking cool I dont care, looks don't keep you from droppinh like a brick from a super effective move
Anyone ever played the mlp ios game?
cachi01: wut?
/me must shut them ;u;
0,5Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey

DashWithRainbows: eeyup
If you'll be mah guuurl!
Ooh ah!
Flam?
Love that song BaconMane <33333
Hey TwilightSonata, you agree, right? Charizard is clearly a dragon, types be damned.
0,5Dat sing along
cachi01: holy shit
Reikim: Duuuuhhh.
Sweet, I'm only on the 3rd volume now.
Near the end of it though.
cachi01: Holy sheet
Although if Charizad was a dragon type it would be soooo awesome.
That's what I though.
Charazard can still drop like a fucking rock
Charizard SHOULD be a dragon. But then he'd be OP.
Well then Ice and dragon would murder him
Man why are you hating on Charizard so much.
dragons have quite a few weaknesses, but they tend to have better stats
Because he's fucking overrated
I gotta say though, Ivysaur is a pimp
It's really annoying though, loads of people think I look like a guy ;A;
thelonecubone: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v246/fi123storm/PA1_Chapter_Fourteen12.jpg
I never said he was THE BEST MON. Only idiots claim there is a BEST MON.
sprunkls u also click it
Reikim: because having an original trio pokemon with 4x weakness to a fairly common type like rock is a pain
I just happen to like him because he's cool.
Plus I kind of have AA cups which freaking sucks ;_;
TwilightSonata: well ofc you're not a guy
cachi01: D:
*facepalm* I found a pic that will make facepalm
Bidoof is worst pokemon
nah, rattatta is worst, and zubat
a real trooper
^
he's right
/me splashes twilight_sprinkle
/me faints
/me uses harden
/me noms on twilight_sprinkle Remains >:3
cachi01: How do you do the action thingy? :s
/me uses splash \:3/
think fast..
Bidoof however...stays retarded through out
TwilightSonata: /me :)
/me dies of cuteness
Oooooh thanks :3
xxx
TwilightSonata: That would be the /me command.
/me licks TwilightSonata :P
Ah, too late.
/me hugs Reikim
Did that work?
yesh
yep
Wooo!
TwilightSonata: so how goes the L cosplay?
Wake me up before you go go. Dont leave me hangin on like a yoyo!!
Sure did
i forget if uber-pokemon are still allowed online, the ones with 600 stats
half of them are dragons too
Ubers are banned.
I know Garchomp is banned
ah
that sucks
Which is actually kind of nice because otherwise the metagame would stagnate.
Bronysith: It's going awesome ^_^ although I had a haircut so I can't use my own hair for it anymore, so I had to buy a wig :s
And Blazakin
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: why is blazikin banned?
augh too much general sou chicken
cause neintendoh of murrikah
The speed boost
cachi01: fackin murikans
TwilightSonata: balls, well my phoenix wright wig is going fine as well, i actually wore it to church today (minus the wig naturally) and the priest came up to me and said "are you in junior law?"
That ability
hm
what i hate are those evasivness buffs
Bronysith: I wanna cosplay Misa sometime though, although I always feel insecure cosplaying characters with kinda revealing outfits, haha...
i despise them so
Hey everypony

Well, it's pretty much a major perk of the mane 6 being young adults. Parents in their lives are somewhat optional.
How are ya'll?
I'm good

Yes, I love that store :D
still, killing applejacks parents seems pointless to me if they arent going to use it for any development
Was curious since you mentioned you got some lotion
and from what i undesrtand, they wont
but when did they die
Yeah, they have really nice smelling stuff

Hey That kind of language is not tolaborated

twilight_sprinkle: You are hilarious. THinking you're awesome.
Im converting oxygen to carbon dioxide right now
I'm blinking right now.
legendary what a coincidence, me too!
String_Shredder: in case it wasnt obvious, i was being sarcastic and parodying people who do it
really?
twilight_sprinkle: ohhhh. sorry. new here
since I've moved out my mom has converted my room into her sewing room
TamaRuhi: dont worry about it
Im typing right now
TamaRuhi: this one is main because there are 6 side chats open during new episode
I'm screwing with you twilight_sprinkle. You're the closest thing to a regular in this chat besides the ACTUAL regulars.
ah
I don't hear sewing as much anymore

BaconMane: ummmm thank you?
Discord vs nightmare moon. GO
yeah, not a lot of people do it anymore
but you just simply type /join pinkie_pie
String_Shredder: uh, what?
legendary: go
*facepalm*
go absolutely wins

it's kind of a tradition with my mom's family, but I don't know if I'll be able to continue it because I kind of suck at it and have no patience
TamaRuhi: Welcome to bronystate. Please leave your brain and all knowledge of how to be civilized at the door!
You made LOL so hard.
tradition to sew? what kind of sewing does she do?
String_Shredder: oh uh. k. I'm kind of new to all the pony stuff
have you done your sacarfice yet
>_>
welcome to the herd
lel
legendary: PLease. I don't EVER want to hear that phrase again.
/join twilight_sparkle i mean, made a typo
i'll get the knife
TamaRuhi, don't believe String_Shredder on that. We're nice to each other.
^
But...b-bu-bu... fine
^not really
Kandarihu: sometimes
well a few are nice, Kandarihu is one of them
LIES Kandarihu
twilight_sprinkle: depending in what days
nowadays mostly baby clothes and blankets
>nice
oh lawl
she has kind of a home business making those
being nice aint cool these days
yessir
I try to be nice. I tend to fail epically at that, though.
but DashWithRainbows hates everything
so
Kandarihu: same here
did serouisly say that
Kandarihu: nah, not at all
:3
thats meanwhile silly
you gotta be a dick to get around on here, right twilight_sprinkle?
She used to decorate people's homes and make curtains and things like that
Hm?
twilight_sprinkle: i know what you mean. lots of people i tlaked to since i watched the show have been real jerks
/me slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
^
But don't be a dick to Jmo. Everybody loves Jmo bbygurlxoxo
TamaRuhi: yeah it is still the internet, gotta keep your guard up at all times
Sounds like a business like that was probably doing great before the recession
Jmo is too good
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large weinie
and everyone ships otakon
like that
BaconMane: Heph heph heph heph
otakon x everything
Well, I guess we can't completely ignore the jerks in the fandom. They certainly exist, and they leave a much bigger impression than the nice people because they cause disruptions.
The item on your left is now your weapon for the zombie appocalips
yeah
Also: TwilightSonata is sexiest bronystate pony.
cant really truely know someone is nice or not until you get in a disagreement with him though
I'm not sure why she stopped doing it
That's new, but true.
legendary: stahp with the 4chan type threads
I'm baaaaack~
:3
String_Shredder: i think hes Neil though..
do what the blachi said
what? they used that before?
She stopped the interior decorating stuff right around the time she was talking about hiring someone to help her
Ohai TwilightSonata :)
twilight_sprinkle: I asked Neil. It's not him.
thelonecubone: Hi sweetie :3
:3
legendary, there's nothing to my left within reach. This rule will leave me doomed to the zombie hoards.
/me gives twilight_sprinkle a cookie ^w^
I thought about that a long time ago and still use with my friends
Is it simply too much work?
String_Shredder: i think he lied
/me gives TwilightSonata a cookie as well :3
brb getting cookies
/me replaces thelonecubone's pot with cookiedough
/me noms on the cookie :3
bah
Yeah, that was probably why
Cupcakes + dead space 2 = no sleep or nightmares
twilight_sprinkle: well, you did smoke some of my pot >.>
the ninjasquare strikes again
twilight_sprinkle: If you look at them side by side, you'll see differences. Plus, I'm following TwilightSonata on instagram.
String_Shredder: Wait, what?
String_Shredder: same country though, and maconbane acts like he knows her..
Look at who?
TwilightSonata: you just really look alike like someone else here
and i mean really
at least from the bits ive seen
Who is it?
twilight_sprinkle: naw, you're high <:
twilight_sprinkle thinks you look like a guy we know.
TwilightSonata: scootachicken is his name iirc, aka Neil

twilight_sprinkle: Oh, no. He still ives there.
thelonecubone: never said it

Ima cow
Hmm
Seems legit
Def cow
Tell me mooo-re
I has got the best idea for my new song
and now hikari is live, haruko goes to the closet of no return
Shizuka there is anyway to put rails mid air ?
13railcraft has suspended rails, else no
Boooo
13you might with pistons but that only works until the rail gets a block update
13which would be as soon as you place another rail
well i'll download that later
13get FTB Direwolf20 pack
13could join my server
i didnt get anything, as i didnt ask for anything.
Hello someone show me the internet
/me suplexes JRP
I really want Minecraft, it looks fun...
Time to make musics
Hello, FireState.
Hi KrazyNoobs :)
/ctcp String_Shredder version
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: same here :)
lel
:(*

What?
I can always try some other day...
String_Shredder: i was trying to do something :>
If you were trying to ping me, mission accomplished.
no
im looking at os's people use
I feel the chance of me getting a gift code is slim to none
Shizuka, what if you had a line of pistons at the spot you wanted to have the tracks float, having rails on each end so it wont do a block update and then activate all the pistons at the same time?
13yay version spam
13bet mine hasn't changed
heh i was wondering if mods could see it
13yep, still 0.8.15
13sane clients typically alert you that someone sent you a CTCP
13[21:35] twilight_sprinkle [jluidtqzns@aeyyns33-29-103-0.buckeyecom.net] requested CTCP VERSION from [Shizuka]:
yeah but i didnt know it displayed to everyone, thought its usually only to the person wwhos being versioned
13anyway SpeccyRush *maybe* but it's not a great idea
if theyre using the proper client that is
13no just the person who's versioned :P
ok lul
13SpeccyRush: if any block on any of the rails changed they'd all get popped off as the connected ones fall
i wonder if it shows on my phone....
Add nes on Wii u
Me
Phone stop changing my Dana text
Shizuka: does it show /whois too?
13no, whois is a request from the server, not clients
hm ok
Do me
...
JRP: did you see it?
Yes
heh
My mind is full of wtf
khaled mardam-bey
13mirc
13was the original dev's name iirc
im back
heh guessed as much
13pidgin says PurpleIRC i think
13obviously site client is lightIRC, or Iris if they're using that
anyway i'll ease up on the ctcp's if its spamming the window
Shizuka: Currently using pidgin and yep, purple
13twilight_sprinkle: nah just shows on the people you're fingering
13except no one uses finger anymore
finger?
Oh my
Shizuka: Oh the days of finger me for my public key
13was an older unix command for requesting information about a user
ah
13fell out of use for some reason or other
No wonder people thought techno people were wierd.
"HEY, LEMME FIGNER YOU REAL QUICK."
13finger users, touch files, man pages
13mount drives
13the unix philosophy is do one thing and do it well, with the unspoken addition that your one thing should then be named something easily turned into a suggestive joke
hence scrot
should make memorization easier at least lul
So, i just watched that Hobbit movie, and there are ponies in it. one of whome is named Minty... Makes me wonder... if its possible that...
no
it's not possible
and i don't want to finger the prince..........*good night everyone!*
whatever you are going to say
jk
Buytoast: :P
bye Dark92Enigma
or nvm i guess, doubel-tabbing here..
or, 30-tabbing
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1356492739263.png
Minty is best pony
Buytoast: A coincident moast likely, but there is a previopous MLP gen pony named Minty.
/me sees what String_Shredder said *YOU ARE WHAT!??* (Cue Iron Man by Black Sabbath)
/me I AM IRON MAN
CrystalPhoenix, well I've found my new wallpaper XD
SantaTheDuck, it's 995x599
CrystalPhoenix: Rarity has a very prominent plot in that picture. Yayyy, socks for everypony!
CrystalPhoenix, doens't matter >.>
how small is your screen
My new wallpaper because of it's adorableness
1920x1080
It would look blurry
Ohey it's that vector.
http://n7ugc.disney.go.com/item/Guest407656274/8_2gs11k6Uj5ti00001004xQI0-h-1fd493-as/Minty%20G4%20version%20%3A%29__600_450_q50.jpg
There is a G4 Minty toy I think, the old School MLP fans really want Minty to appear in the show.
Rex_Mundi, I never followed the previous gen and I want Minty in the show
Rex_Mundi: That´s because Minty == love
and if you don´t love minty, read http://kimonos-house.livejournal.com and then you will
twilight_sprinkle: btw, i wasn't leaving 5 minutes ago, i just quoted Yakko
CrystalPhoenix: Well, the previous Gen, gen 3, is terrible. But whatever. I want Minty!
Minty is like one of the only likeable character in gen 3
no no no, Finger Prince
Dark92Enigma: i realized that a smidge bit too late :P
i don't think so
altho idk what yakko is
This fire makes me wet
twilight_sprinkle: Animaniacs
and String_Shredder left before i could blasted him with a REPULSIVE RAY
the one with the shirt and hat
Dark92Enigma: oh yeah, that he was that guy?
thelonecubone: mkay
twilight_sprinkle: i take it, you never seen Animaniacs growing up?
I think the real question is why/how Minty got to Middle-earth?
Dark92Enigma: no, and i didnt like the streamed eps
ok then :S
but i love it :)
Animaniacs is pretty legit
thelonecubone: yeah that he was ILOVEPONIES. pretending to be 10 year old. (WHy? i'll never know)
best animated show ever
11,02i am 14 wut is dis
Dark92Enigma: and he was also pretending with twilightsonata i think
I am a pokemon, what is this dis bone
because after deeweearrs reaction, im almost certain it was neil
lol
thelonecubone: can you do ti?
done
kk :P

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPMYRYrNHks
Buytoast: but they are awesome
I am surprised at what some people turn in to the artist training grounds.
How so?
i love pancakes
Some of them are extremely poorly drawn, to the point they are not even showlike.
Some are jokes, and look like 5 year old drawings.
I can't draw anyways, sooo...
They don't care about the quality
I drew Luna with a Santa hat on yesterday :)
all that matters to them is publicity
its about creativity
I drew a Fluttershy completely out of Zalgo yesterday (took me 80 minutes)
Or at least effort
Zalgo as in the text function
KrazyNoobs: zalgo? the text thing?
^
KrazyNoobs: i can has link?
hi
^
You know, the song "Santa Baby" makes a lot more sence to me when replacing Santa with Luna...:$
twilight_sprinkle: I can copy paste it to you via. Personal Mesagge
KrazyNoobs: kk
I won't do it here, because, you know, it is highly discouraged
Copypasta?

Still kinda wish I had Minecraft though
Minecraft is nice. Tekkit/Technic is Minecraft on steroids
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: why dont you save money on it?
for it*
I dont have a job
ah
Plus Technic/Tekkit is free after getting Minecraft
Notch - "If you don't have the cash for it, just go ahead and pirate it..."
I might to try to get my dad to get me it some time later
though SR:R and SRO does look promising too
Stallion_of_War: good guy Notch?
My parents won't accept me being a brony
Why would a creator not care people pirate his game?
Good Guy Notch.
kidzrul732: whats ur excuse?
I don't know
He's made a crap ton of money already off it, plus I think there'
He doesn't care about Minecraft
there's sort of a fanbase loyalty when you go ahead and say that people can have it if they can't buy it.
he's milked plenty of cash out of it
Just like CoD
except MInecraft is,,,good
I'd rather pay for something from a creator that doesn'
11,02Ponies47: ban pls

It's not my fault it's my parents
legendary: I'd guess not, since none of the merchandise that's set to come out after the finale has her as one; given the Canterlot Wedding merch that was out before the episode.
Guys chill. It was a setup. I'm not banned :p

Buytoast: Does that mean that someone has to invite you, or that you have to send a request?
beauty and the beast=best disney film
SantaTheDuck: thank you :
hell if I know
:)*
but i'm willing to bet the former
Lightning_Wing: Saw that 2 nights ago
Is Killing Floor really that good? It looks like just an over-gored L4D clone.
Rarararara, rarararaaaah
thelonecubone, but the official Steam release came at 2009
I kinda want to see how long this fire can go. We've probably set a record

twilight_sprinkle: bullshit
Bronysith: wat
twilight_sprinkle: no wai
Petrified_Discord: nope
An episode from the perspective of anyone but the mane 6 or the cmc will probably be a good thing, whether it's background ponies (ZOMG DAT PANDERING) or bad guys
twilight_sprinkle: LIAR
twilight_sprinkle: It cannot be
Petrified_Discord: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixvCXo2rhIU
i got a fuzzy schushy blue pillow :D *squee*
Let just say something really important that nobody said it yet
Bronysith: r3 isnt about him, that was announced from the start
>nobody said yet
jcelios, that trope is called a Lower Deck Episode. And yes, I agree that it would be interesting.
did someone say...
PANDERING?
I know right
>entire morning everyone said that
twilight_sprinkle: i might have to get back into code geass, the writing seems fine
twilight_sprinkle: Ooooooooooooooh it's not after the events of r2
THAAAAAAAAAAAAT explains everything
Bronysith: ive not seen r3 yet though
Kandarihu: Lower Deck Episode, thanks, always good to know your tropes :)
i hope they dont take it off youtube too fast
soooo killing floor is like a cod zombies or wat lel
twilight_sprinkle: i know, i mean the show it self seems well written, except r2
can we roleplay?

why not?

Celestia is worst alicorn
Bronysith: You do know this is a show about friendship and 6 different ponies learning how to be better friends with lessons each episode to improve themselvs. right?
Yeah.. I am done.
yesssss
wait n
10:30 here
it's been about 56 episodes
no
you'd think white selfish would've learned to be good by now
Rex_Mundi: yea, but even then, the show lacks an amazing amount of consistency and character development
but no
She sends 6 very mortal ponies TO MOVE A POSSIBLY VIOLENT DRAGON!
WHICH ARE MOSTLY MAGIC IMMUNE
THE FUCK
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: celestia is still sexy though
Pony smexy list. Twilight > Aj > Fluttershy > Rarity > Rainbow dash > pinkie pie
cachi01: /)
cachi01: id like to think rarity is a kind, teasing mistress
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: (\
Oh God, the ponies are all so sexy, i cant list themm
hey guys did you see the leaked episode? big mac and cheerlilee make such a cute couple. *slow brony*
Also Celestia is worst sister
Best pony list. pinkie pie > twilight = rarity > Aj > fluttershy > RD
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: TBH, i think celestia is to busy being molestia to alot of ponies to actually do anything
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least thats my head canon T~T
Sister came back after her 1000 banishment... DONT INFORM HER ABOUT THE CHANGES
THE SHIT CELESTIA

Bronysith: and Luna is the shy and cute one ^w^
thelonecubone: What? this place is negative, not compared to 4chan, or Newgrounds... or furaffinity. Especially not furaffinity.
hi Adjeca
cachi01: calm down
>.>
<.<
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: actually, i think that cadance is worst alicorn, cause at least celestia was a previously established character and not shoe horned in for the sake of sales and stupid deus ex machina
cachi01: well go play something
:P
Cadence is fairly smoaking herself too.
i prefer deus ex MACHINE GUN
At least Cadance is more useful than celestia
Rex_Mundi: the wings kill it for me
if you have herpes
jus throw ur wife
and you know what? grab some of my stash if you want, blachi
when some one leaves its like "bye ""bye"" see ya" when i leave:"......"
Celestia the one time she helps, GETS TAKEN DOWN LIKE A CHUMP
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least Celestia doesnt have a shitty Mary Sue OC story
like shining armor
or cadance
sowwy legendary text flood :$
true story
yay
> Had a brother since they were little, > no mention of him whatsoever till his wedding
Wat
Lets all flood thecomment section YAY
Bronysith: My theory on alicorns, is that there are 2 special ones (Celestia and luna), and a few much less special ones, like Cadance.
no? ok
Celestia and Luna = alicorn.
the filler ones
lel
Cadance = winged unicorn
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "oh, i love my brother so much, that is why i never mention him ever to my closest friends at all"
luna+luna=moon
Bronysith: So is it fair to say I find that retarded?
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "and hes captain of the royal guard and marrying my other best friend who is a princess and has love magic"
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: yea, cadance and shining armor have no reason to be in the show
Sounds like a bad fanfic Bronysith
love magic? *snickers*
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: im sure Shining armor couldve been like a long lost friend or something and the episode could still work
Bronysith: OK, they should have at least mentioned Cadance and Shining armore bofore they got married. I give you that.
Celestia = Sun and troll Luna = Moon and dreams. Cadence = Love and uhmmm great r34 material?
nah
cadances wings just kill it for me
what's going on here? :)
T~T
oh yeah her wings :/
apparently poking with a stick = host time out
Also the whole premise of the wedding plot bugs the shit out of me
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: but hey, what can you do? lauren faust left so the studio has to result to deus ex machina and fanservice to carry out the show
luna = Nightmares and dreams get it? nightMAREs hahahaha
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: can i say this
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: stop
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i take this
Unnr: oh yeah, that is what i did after 4 mins
season 2 finale was good
season 3 premiere was meh
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the whole changeling fight scene was pointless, afterall "only i can break the spell on that door, me, celestia" "go to the elements of harmony and get them" how would they fucking open the door?
not bad not good
average
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZivRFeXsk8M ultimate poking
cachi01: season 2 finale, only reason people like it is because of the fight scene
so i came a cross this website called bronystate and i-...... im still here arent i?
Bronysith: What do the wings take away exactly. Alicorns are still rare so its not like theres suddenly a proliferation of wings. Cadance is hawt regardless
Bronysith: Actually I think they were in the room not the actual vault
legendary: no
The vault had a huge hallway
this is a dream
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: still pisses me off
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: not to mention chrysallis is fucking stupid
legendary: eeyup
ah
cachi01: A dream that needs to be paid, you forgotten about that
Need love, instill fear on every one
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "your love made me more powerful than celestia" 5 seconds later "trying to gain power with love? yea that wont work" T~T
If she gains power by love how did love beat her?
you need to pay 62$ a month to be in dreambronystate
I dun get it
Need to sleep.. but want to watch Doctor Who Season 2 Finale
Such a delima
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: thats like, one country nuking another country, then that country gets the same nuke and the original country is all "that nuke wont work"
///////)_=
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: love + magic
I once played this game called real life.. it had a horrible storyline
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2253230/Footballs-marked-warning-stating-choking-hazard-according-EU-regulations.html
hehehehehehehe
cachi01: Still retarded
yeah u r right......
it hd good graphics
*had
still fireplace
Unnr: Lol
Also couldent Chrysalis just do things peacfully? Why did she have to do a take over?
caause
she is hawt
cause plt
Stupid?
plot*
the tutorial lasted 18 years
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: would you let a demon basically steal your soul?
the controlls were confusing
Well Im sure they could arange something
Heres a question, can unicorns become powerfull enough to challenge Celestia? Maybe Sombra could have had a chance if it wasnt 2 on 1. Maybe
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: again, the entire season 2 finale was just pure fanserivice
http://derpy.me/xSoDj
:3
Rex_Mundi: Well since shit like a god damn brooch lying around yea
party hard
cause "DURR, LAUREN ISNT HERE ANYMORE AND WE HAVE NO GOOD WRITERS, SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON FANSERVICE AND FIGHT SCENES" goddamnit
How the fuck did you miss that celestoa
fanservice everywhere
party soft
seriously, fuck the season 2 finale
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq04v7b5bJ1qjf12k.jpg
I love how Equestria has ARTIFACTS OF POWER JUST LYING AROUND
The season 2 finalle are the best 2 episodes yet
ikr
Good job celestia
woah watchut we got a badass over here
Good job making sure your kingdom is safe
it wasnt consistent, the characters contradicted themselves and also completely neglected what they learned in the episode 3 of season 2, right SpadeKyurem[WoW] ?
Yea
who fucking cares.
I am glad they at least acknowledge previous episodes
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "always believe your friends, even if you think its not a big deal" /)_=
Also Discord was kinda stupid in his plannings
Most cartoons don't
And that is one of the things that got me hooked on MLP
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: not as dumb as chrysallis
If he didnt treat things like a game he would have won
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: hes not as dumb as chryssalis
His own personality was his downfall
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: at least he wasnt stupid like chrysallis
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: and at least he wasnt deus ex bossima
Also how come only shining armor can maintain the shield
Discord will be discord, he does eviil for the luls. Some ponies arent interested in logical things like money. Some ponies just want to watch the world burn.
I dont how 1 crystal pony said" the crystall princess is back" but it showed cadense as a filly in the season 2 finale
doesnt canterlot have..I dont know ALOT OF UNICORNS
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Plot holes, let me show them you!
you know
u can still be a filyl
filly
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it was written like a bad fanfic, "only a shield that only i am strong enough to maintain"
and a princess
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: CONVENIENCE
FOR THE ENEMY
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: also, who the fuck sent a threat to canterlot?
Bronysith: I really find the finale to be bad in logic
me
How is that such a stretch?
Also bride acts like a total bitch...BLOW IT OFF
Wat
The episode does explain why Cadance is a Princess. it seems she is decended from Crystal royalty and or related to Celestia.
Derpy hooves vs a muffin man. GO
this
isnt
4chan
They become friends. Move on.
Sparta
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: also, cadance magic=blue, chrysallis magic = green....no one fucking notices this
3 female alicorns. 0 male alicorns. Shinanigans!
Bronysith: Or her fucking singing
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "hey is this bitch singing how shes planning on destroying us all right in front of us?"
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: "lets stand here like idiots and find out"
Also cant you dectect magic or something?
Rex_Mundi: its because malealicorns look like this https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9Y9JNZCYAAWZP-.jpg:large
Bronysith: depends in terms of quality? yeah very good imo. in terms of personality? hard to say
You would think celestia would do a sweep to check for spys or such
best pony that sings? obliously Luna
cachi01: lelelelel sprunkls oc
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: just goes to show, the studio CANT write good villain songs, and the setup is fucking wrong, it wasnt like that in the little mermaid,
Bronysith: Are you trying to put logic into the song and dance numbers? Its like baliwood in ponyville with the random song and dance numbers.
I still want to know what the hell Luna was doing during the whole thing Bronysith
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: lunaughty
:P
The whole did I miss anything line seems so trollish
Luna sleeps during the day and Celestia vice versa
Oh you didnt miss anything...just the invasion of canterlot
anyway.
g2g
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i heard some questions the fandom has will be expanded on in s3
Bye cachi01 :)
goodnight everypony :)
Has anyone actually seen Luna or Celestia sleeping?
merry xmas
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: perhaps that will be one of them
sleep well :)
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dude, the current writers have no idea how to write, so they just give SHITLOADS OF FANSERVICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
bye cachi01
oh you miss the kiss
Barbetos: in my bed
But is that sleep?
: D
Bye Legendary
Goodnight cachi01, may Luna grant you 'interesting' dreams!
Barbetos: after they are done with me they sleep yes
Are you SURE?
http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3sc1nc/
I doubt any of it even happened
Also why the hell does Canterlot have a fucking cave they used to put ponies in?
Celestia just magics you, and nothing actually happened.
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sex dungeon :P
Barbetos: doesnt matter had awesome sex
nite cachi01
Obviously, the ponyverese is darker than the show would have you belive.
it was justa mine everypony fogot about
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: again, its the current writers trying and failing at being epic...the show doesnt need to be epic
I swear the s2 finale could be passed off as a bad fanfic
like
at
ALL
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: it is a bad fanfic =_=
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: animation was good though >.>
We nead Tirak to kidnap some ponies and take them to midnight castle. and pony slavery, more of that.
If you overthink it its bad but i found ejoyeable
the show seems to be more focused on animation now though instead of good writing or character development
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-XPNAexw4Q
Sombra was boring
it was enjoyable that is true, but it did feel like it was going off in the wrong direction
He had nothing interesting going for him
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: more villainous than chrysallis
All it wa, GRAGH and crystals
Get a dictionary damn it
Gak had more dialogue than King sombra
at least we knew who the villain was the whole time instead of "OH HEY THIS IS BAD GUY HERE HEY HEY THIS IS BAD GUY THIS IS WHO YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT"
friggin deus ex bossima
Mr. Sombrero is a better villian than chrysallis
Bronysith: Chrysalis seemed shoehorned
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-XPNAexw4Q
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: i fucking said that, she was put in for clop

twilight_sprinkle: show me your geass

Bronysith: what the hell is that??? *runs away*
*takes Bronysith to bed with me*
twilight_sprinkle: Bronysith sadly suffers from tentacle-itus
welp i found about 4 hours of songs(brony songs) so fuck sleep
a sad condition
Unnr: yeah...for me... reminds me of drawn together
Legendary, don´t you have the brony music archive?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfpTYusySQg
Shizuka so i just choose the mod and put my minecraft profile in the launcher ?
Every brony should watch this. Just to educate themselvs of the MLP franchise. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K2aIA6nOiw
twilight_sprinkle: i met the voice for toot braunstein and princess clara
this is a new laptop and its confusing me and im not used to computers
Bronysith: yeah i saw the pic with tara :P
13TheGreatAndPowerfulT: yeah you load in your username and it fills out from there
13you'll have to disable portalgun and add logisticspipes though
Bronysith: a friend f mine was supposed to try to ask her to voice something for me but he never did...
13
twilight_sprinkle: lols, i love how she voices kid cartoons and adult shit as well
and wat just happend
Shizuka: BLANKETY BLANKETY BLAAAAANK
twilight_sprinkle: that sucks...
Bronysith: yeah... next year im asking you :D
twilight_sprinkle: if shes at dragoncon >.>
Bronysith: true, there's that
twilight_sprinkle: im meeting little kuriboh at momocon in 2013, anything you want me to have him say?
Invaders must die
Bronysith: nah thx anyway
and leeron
twilight_sprinkle: or from either the male or female commander shephard VAs?
Bronysith: i'll think about it :)
Bronysith: ive never played mass effect
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n729aJQD1dw
/me slaps twilight_sprinkle
:P
twilight_sprinkle: on sale on steam right now, the mass effect 1 and 2
Play the first 2
you aint mising much with 3
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the 3rd is good, the ending is the only bad part >.>
hm well i'll think about it
/me blasts off before shit storm
SpadeKyurem[WoW]: 3 is pretty good, up to the end
I dont like games that give me moral choices that dont fucking matter
Why give them to me in the first place
i never really liked mass effect or any RPG except walking dead and fallout
Fallout 3 makes me sad
its not the story of the vault dweller
I like fallout new vegas
i bet nobody here ever heard of command and conquer 3:kanes wrath
yes
wat
Shizuka how do i add the logisticspipes ? already disabled the portalgun
And that is red alert 2
legendary, but that was the one where he had the cool head makeup
Well.. Actually you are right
13sec i'll get link
Forgot about kanes wrath
Anypony here play Myth: The Fallen Lords
?
13http://ci.thezorro266.com/job/LogisticsPipes/37/
Such an amazing game
I think it was not good.
Fallout 3 is stupid. New Vegas is the greatest RPG of the decade
13drop that into the mods folder, might have to start the game once to fill out the folder
i liked kanes wrath that 1 was my favorite
13launcher will put all the files in Direwolf20/ next to the launcher

That jumble of words

yo
hey
that reminds me, i need to get off my lazy butt and finally try to fix my ancient psp
Err letters
translation: i'm not sure what am i typing
I agree
nevermind
twilight_sprinkle: I am immensely grateful but I point out flaws too often I suppose..
I got a new shirt, a bit of cash (odd for a 55 year old, but an extra 20 mis never turned down) some pony (Which I did NOT expect, but four buttons and a couple of hang-ups-- and one of the hyang-ups was DERPY) is nice, and a reproduction of one of my Grandmotehr's painting, to be framed and hung.\
what i miss?
twilight_sprinkle: you got an old PSP :O
my psp works, but it got hit on the back a while ago and the screen doesnt turn on, wonder what it cold be
thelonecubone: i had it for years
nothing
my brother has his, he doesnt use it all the time, he got it when we move back to the aparments
im wondering if i should buy pokemon b/w and b/w 2
they make them too fast
twilight_sprinkle: for the new gen yes
/me is still trying to get used to the smaller keyboard on his laptop
Kipkat07_Scarf: you'll get use to it
my keyboard is so old and small xD
and the laptop is like 8 years old
Desktop only for me. I have neither a need for a laptop nor a desire for one.
still runs good
thelonecubone, how good?
Kencolt: aye, everyone has their favourites
texasboykc09: not sure how to say it
DAMN IT ALL!! I have to do my lab report :'(
Finally joined the iPhone crowd
:S
thelonecubone, play games on it?
Kipkat07_Scarf: how long till you go back to school?
I'm looking at the not-quite-a-stream and thinking, "I have a fireplace, I have the logs left by the previous owner, I could make an actual fire-- but I'd have to clean it up. That would suck."
unable too
wait... I can wait till morning to start it
the new ones i mean
Polydunami: iphone 5?
Did Playstation Allstars get released?
I believe it's 4
ok, i dont like the 5th one much anyway
thelonecubone: I get back on 4 January
its too long, hard to scroll with a thumb of one arm
Polydunami: is it bigger then your palm of your hand?
Not that I can tell
Kipkat07_Scarf: work on it tomorrow then
It's longer, but not wider
Polydunami: well Iphone4
:P
thelonecubone: I had an excuse not to start it till now but I need to finish it
Yep. So then, first app I download is that My Little Pony game.
Kipkat07_Scarf: you got enough time to finish it, but i recomend you to start it tomorrow
i accidentally made it so that i wont get a single daily reward for playing the game til 2021
so you dont have to worry about it till later
Oh dear
true.
twilight_sprinkle: oh god
How do you fudge that?
twilight_sprinkle: The heck did that happen?
i was told that if you do the manual day switch bug then you wont get a reward for that day even if you set the actual date back,so i thought that when doing the manual day switch bug if i set it to 2020 i would still get the rwards until that year
but it turns out it includes all days until that date
I think it did
i thought i would set it to 2020 and then set it back to 2012 so i could get my rewards for 8 years, but alas
Is there any way to uninstall an app from your iPhone?
hi
Polydunami: nope youre stuck with them forever :P
yo
Nothing to reset the whole game?
Dang
Polydunami: im joking :P
Polydunami: to delete an app you press any app, and hold for a bit
Polydunami: I think you're supposed to hold the button on the phone for a bit till you see a X on the app
Polydunami: then it starts jiggling
or what sprunkls just said :P
Okay, I've never needed to do that before
Polydunami: all the apps start jiggling i mean, and X's appear, so you can delete them then
and move them around
Polydunami: you can take screenshots btw by pressing the top button and the front button simultaneously
Oh, I see
yay c:

hello KrazyNoobs
11,02thelonecubone: moo :3

Every time an admin says the word, "kick" or "ban", I get scared.
13what about
13KICKBAN
That's how krazy of a noob i am
k-line sounds scariest to me
Kickban isn't as intimidating, to tell the truth.
idk why
KrazyNoobs, why does it scare you
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eJay2QHmZM
Shizuka: dun dun dunnnnn
tecasboykc09: It really doesn't, I was using that as an example for a noob.
It is only when they say kick or ban in the same sentence as your name you really get worried. inb4 someadminpony does it
13yay nether breaks dynmap .-.
KrazyNoobs, no i see why, i would too
11,02kick and ban someone? alright
k-line sounds scariest to me because it doesnt have the classical words of kick or ban in it, it sounds like something else and something especially badm which it is
/me picks a random name in the chat to ban

I remember when I got banned permanately for my brother getting on my keyboard, I thought, at the time, that I was never going to get back in to the best Brony Livestream on the internet (chat area, that is what makes me spend hours here)
damn that brothers
secret asian langauge?
He went on and started talking about disgusting stuff with Pokemon.
they always post porns and r34
and arguing
ouo: porn and r34 are the same
Rule 34 isn't porn, it is just genetilia drawn on to characters.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0oV3jid-0c&list=PL55BC4FB9EA2BE577&index=124
Which is wierd.
KrazyNoobs: eh, true
but let's not go that far
But yeah, I got banned twice because of him, and I thought they would never let me on again.
ig i'll do something like that this isn't me, it's my brother >_>
But I changed the password to my computer, and he is now off.
He is 13, by the way, and drew penises all over my old brony shirts. At least my parents made him buy me new ones (in a larger size, so they actually fit this time), and he also had to pay for the shipping.
This was about 3 weeks, 4 weeks ago
Aw well, people do insensitive things. : /
oh i forgot on english cancer != crayfish
._.
KrazyNoobs, how did you get back on
KrazyNoobs: your parents should've disipline a little bit more, because quite frankly that was rude
seeing that you dont have the best of luck
ouo: so its your brother who posts the questionable pic here occasionally?
13HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN //
I AM WELL? //
Shizuka: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!
great Miss Shizu and you?
texasboykc09: I told them again, but they thought it was an excuse. I wrote something to BronyState@gmail.com saying how I changed my password.

I /hate/ going anywhere without atleast socks
texasboykc09: Yeah, although sometimes, I type something questionable, and I ask myself whether it is worth posting. I only do this very few times, sometimes everypony is okay with it, once, I was really irresponsible and went on google to find something (a symbol), and I was stupid enough to post it. I was severly warned, and I will not do that again.
mind you, I live in a basement where all the floors are hard and cold
i always wear socks
even with sandals
this is my fav applejak song

I always rethink pressing Enter after I have typed the comment when there is a discussion of r34 or something like that, as I don't want to post anything too offensive (even mentioning that think I said back there is making me think this is questionable)
KrazyNoobs, i was there for that and baconmane was very serious
AdamTheDuck: i wanted it ;3;
the only time I will go barefoot is in our 2-week session of not-snowing that we dare to call Summer
11,02D:
you're a fast drinker, AdamTheDuck ;3;
texasboykc09: When I got in trouble with baconmane was when i was talking about how I used to be in teh GNAA, and everyone was making a huge deal out of it. At the time, I was urgently trying to change the conversation.
Lol the fire video just reset

hey Ponies47, have you ever danced "Stag" before? *innocent smile*
Lunar_Brony: the term, like a cat being swung by its tail comes to hoof....
Eh?

Ponies47 I'm guessing you don't even know what that is...
Nope
Tell you what. Put a white hankerchief around you wrist and you'll find out soon enough :)
O.O
inb4 he just Googles it
worse is if you are in the same room as a poorly played gurdy and a poorly played Rauschpfeife or Shawm
Stag - To go alone "I'm goin stag to the dance."
o.O
AdamTheDuck not when you dance stag
anyway im out, bye

Bye twilight_sprinkle :)
unfortunately, the first, last, and (so far) only time I've danced stag, I was the poor soul who played the female
and let me tell you, girls must have nimble feet if they can do the moves I was told to "attempt"

Welcome back KrazyNoobs
ie is good.........for getting other browsers
then why does that very described machine run IE at a somewhat-usable pace? (And by somewhat usable, I mean I was able to get Chrome downloaded after only 10 seconds of searching and 30 seconds of "HOLY CRAP!" and similar reactions)
holy... http://kriskoul.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-one-of-worlds-most-elite-shoe.html

Hello
Ohai Moopy
Ohai AdamTheDuck
the chat seems slow tonight whats going on here?
hey guys
Hey alexxm
how are things Moopy
Umm good i guess
So a how long is Bronystate is going to be out of buisness again i think i lost track
until today i think
Hmmmm
AdamTheDuck, made it to space yet?
sure
Phase4, nah just making different jets at the moment
I wonder if a VTOL is possible o.o
Sweet umm...... i got a awesome cool lookin headset its a razoer chimaera 5.1 headset and it uses for my xbox and i think it uses for the computer i guess
Ohai alexxm
how are things AdamTheDuck
alexxm, fun, mass murdering kerbals is a great way of relieving anger o.o
And i got a comfortable chair that has speakers on it and it has the speakers underneath the bottom to as well
who wasnt here to see the picture yesterday?
aniderp|bestfruitcak, the heart warming picture you drew for BronyState? :)
yes
AdamTheDuck, vtol is possible but harrier style 'move engine exaust' isnt yet :(
some didnt see it i think..
you need seperate engines for vtol and normal flight
Phase4, yeah I was hoping I could recreate the Reaver ESF or something XD
Is there a way to switch between engines?
you could somewhat recreate a galaxy
action groups, you can bind the number keys to actions
Ahh, it feels like Spore all over again :)
except its better than spore
cause you can build rockets
^
who thinks i should enter the art thingy?
/me is shot
aniderp|bestfruitcak, do it if you wish, no one is stopping you :P

Gold_Demona: wait until you have nephews and then give them away? :D
aniderp|bestfruitcak: I got her a box set of an anime called Eden of the East.
What the unhealthy interest?
MadSurge: You mean nieces. :D
i like anime :D
I have nephews
my little cousins thinks mlp is stupid ;_;
Gold_Demona: why, can't kids play with small coloured horsies? :D
i didnt have a picture of sombra to show them
Phase4, it sort of works.. Sort of... XD
MadSurge: Because I have to live with their parents griping about me forever if I do that. :P
aniderp|bestfruitcak punish him with a trip to the moon
next time i see them.. they will see sombra
Gold_Demona: :D
2 little cousins
10 and 8
>..
but.. least my older cousin likes them she gonna give me some of hers!
Sombra's not that great of a villain. He was more of a "menacing presence" than an actual villain.
Crysalis blows Sombra out of the water.
but i will see the ones she has cause
Phase4 RAINBOW
and she older
Gold_Demona: Chrysalis is a better villain :$
my mother calls them the morbid ones
Gold_Demona: I still expect Sombra to return though

got zelda oot shirt,zelda golgen skyward sword and silver skyward sword
wait - not a vodka...
hmm chouces...
cant remember...crap :|
choose
gold.silver,or bow arrow link
silver
ok silver one it is
bows and arrows....I'd like to play skyrim all day...dont think I can get away with it - on the other hand, I know the jobsite is a mud pit, got heavy rain early yesterday morning with the cold front....
and I dont fancy working in the cold today...
If anyone asks....I overslept >_>
Cypresswolf, you sure did >_> <_<
...too much...eggnog? Yeah, Eggnog! Thats it >_>
i slerpt too much during the day now im wide awake at 11:44 pm
so much for work tomorrow
so, who has plans for new years?
I doubt we have much to do - the last 2 weeks, we got done with the latest plan updates in less than an hour - we're waiting on other crews to finish their stuff, before we can move forward - its all little odds and ends with the underground
spent the rest of the day doing nothing, pretending to "organize" our conex box
just to look busy...can only go so far
had to google conex box
bassically a shipping container right?
at least they look like them
yes
plenty of storage space in those things - you have to have those on the jobsite nowadays - didnt use them 20 years ago - mainly to store things you dont want stolen
fair enough, equipment isnt cheap
pvc and emt pipe we still keep outside - no one's gonna take that stuff, copper wire, cords, ladders, etc - inside as well as little stuff - couplings, screws, breakers - stuff that have to stay dry
breakers I mean
...by the sound of it, seems my brother isnt getting up for work either (keeps hitting his snooze button) :D
lol, work is for chumps, he's got the right idea
SO
MUCH
SILENCE
i know right
Andrew: i took the pic

Well, I'm going to bed now. Night, BronyState
Goodngiht KrazyNoobs
goodnight KrazyNoobs

Eeexactly. Can't let these viruses get you down! :D
BRB gonna play roblox pony RPG :P
oh Gold_Demona ?
i tried white wine..
MadSurge: It's been alright thus far. How has yours been? :)
Oh?
morning, kiddies
Ugh, wine... I cannot stand wine.
i would rather have berry wine
AssaultWithEmbraces: Holla! :)
GilDash: I has a new laptop :$
Hoi GilDash~
and on newyears guess whjat
MadSurge: Awesome. What make and model? ^_^
MadSurge! :D
Wine is a type of drink that is best to have with particular kinds of foods.
AssaultWithEmbraces! <3
Gold_Demona: Perhaps, but I'd pick something else every single time. :D
Heya AssaultWithEmbraces! :)
im gonna try baileys on new years!
baileys irish cream
Hoi MLP_Brovakiin :D
/me hugs AssaultWithEmbraces pre-emptively.

Oooh, Bailey's is very nice. Especially in coffee.
see? im drinking responsibly
/me is underage
MadSurge: Checking specs now. :p
oh well close to being 21
/me guesses what

When people say "underage" and then say "almost 21" my British mind goes, "wait, what?"
i know right, should be 18
I got a new book, Trans Siberian Orchestra CD, clothes and The Dark Knight trilogy collector's edition DVD with a book on the art and making of the Dark Knight movies
GilDash: here here :D

Well, I finally have a crime game on my Steam account.
Kandarihu: Which one?
Retro City Rampage
Never heard of it. XD
I thought you was gonna say L.A Noire or something :P
Hmm... always meant to play that game.
I actually need to play both Portals at some point as well. Never had the chance. :(
/me hands GilDash both portals :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv0O6oHeVzE Here's a hillarious trailer for it. Prepare for 80's nostalgia and corniness.
Meh, I haven't played that game in ages :P
I kinda want to now :I
Kandarihu: It's been so long... I'm not sure I could play anything like that today. :D
Oh dear, we're being infested with the undead...
Appropriate for a dead chatroom, I suppose. :D
sry my fault
So, who's still hungover from yesterday? :D
Not I. I didn't have enough wine. :P
Didn't get hungover
/me slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
I wasn't drinking. Waiting until I feel a little less under the weather.
I have plans for new years. But other than that, nope.
Oh dear... Not sure I can do anything on New Years. I've got to be at work the next day. -__
Bummer.
Oh, aye. Thing's will be 'interesting' next month as well. -_-
It's a shame. I've got a bottle of whiskey I've not had the chance to open as well.
who has wii u
Nope. Not really interested in Nintendo... or Sony... can't get away with saying "or Microsoft", but not the 360 either. XD
05I... live... AGAIN

hello everypony
Well, it's time to head into and through the maelstrom. The more we wait, the worse it's gonna get. So I'll see you later guys. I might check in from restaurants along the way.
Kandarihu: Alright. Good luck and godspeed. :)
texasboykc09: Holla! :)
hey texasboykc09
ohai texasboykc09 :)
The yellow one has a name! :D
Ooh, Calvin and Hobbes! Nice! =D
Okay, so first the undead, now the forces of Hell are joining us. XD
Sorry, the tornadoes got confused. They should have arrived on 21st.
That day was already BLOWN enough out of proportion.
worst...or best?
It was pretty damned pathetic, wasn't it?
Eeyup
It was a failpocalypse
I was expecting raining fire. Bitterly disappointed.
I was at LEAST expecting zombies
Had my peashooters out and everything.
Eh, zombies are overdone. I wouldn't mind seeing something more traditional. Plagues, locusts, toads, that kind of thing.
Ah yes, the plagues
I don't suppose the common cold counts as a plague. =/
Gold_Demona: Dunno, but mine's beating me something rotten right now.
I usually don't have difficulties breathing with colds... -_-
Yeah it tends to do that, but then your immune system will wake up and kick its ass.
Gold_Demona: It's actually your immune system causing your symptoms.
just eat those vitamin c tablets like they're candy
It'll walk up to the cold virus and be like "Hey, you punks! Get outta dis bice body!" and make the virus so scared it make them want to go home and go to bed.
dis nice*
I could try sing to thrash metal to get it to leave. Might end up sounding like doom metal though. XD
lol
I wonder if a VA has ever used a cold for a temporary character?
Hi guys, the other day, I got Assassin's Creed.
Heya VenHur :)
hey VenHur
hello VenHur
VenHur: Holla! :)
VenHur: I presume you mean AC3 and not the first one. :D
GilDash: NOPE.avi
VenHur: Oh, you do actually mean the first one?
GilDash: It IS the first one, I only brought just to prevent story spoilers from the later installment.
VenHur: Fair enough. I've not played any of the others except for the first one.
goodnight/goodmorning/good afternoon/see ya later everyone :P

Ohai VioletGreySha! ^-^
alexxm, good and you
texasboykc09, forgot to add cache-control: must-revalidate to the http headers, so people who are behind caching proxys and don't know it are getting stale copies due to poor proxy design
VioletGreySha, alexxm: Holla! :)

GilDash, re-requests everything on the page with no-cache headers set

Havok: just search for Rubberfruit's most recent video
Is Rubberfruit even still doing those?
i don't think so
GilDash: it was Rubberfruit and The Living Tombstone :D
MadSurge: What was?
GilDash: the Heavy video :D
I'm not exactly well versed in this SFM stuff. :D
MadSurge: Oh, the pizza one?
Yep!
I see.
That looks like Shiz's GTA. XD
is this gta?
Yes it is
:D
which one 4?
Think so
You know, this would be an interesting version of GTA to play.

That raptor seems so happy when it opens its mouth. XD
GilDash: natural smile :D

GilDash: indeed, i liked what u did last time
Bronysith: I don't even remember. XD
Wrek - no DLCs?
dDat name
MirrorImage: All of them
Wreky
Good morning everypony and Wrek!
It's Energizer Bunny.
Not Duracell.
So what faction Wrek will join this time? :D
I hate naming characters. It takes me about an hour. XD
Twit.
:P
BS Mod?
No
Familiar voice is familiar...
DERP DERP HURR HURR
Give him an enormous forehead, Wrek.
GilDash - doc mitch is voiced by Michael Hogan if that helps you at all
alexxm: And God, am I glad.
So.
Much.
Stress...
:(
MirrorImage: Yes, I think it does. Thank you. :)
Mostly because of my sister, which I will NOT get into.
Bronysith: Wat?
i like swords
dare i say the obvious here? "Spend 15 minutes creating your face - never see it for the rest of the game"
O...okay... o_o?
MirrorImage What if he uses third person?
killerpony7733 - ok, so you see his mullet
take all the things
Loot everything so you can sell it later :3
MirrorImage: That's nothing I've spend an hour or two on a character face before I gave up and used defaults.
he's mustache the questions
ooo, sim-gret remix
,mmm
mmmmm
too much autotune for me :\
and wubs
choose naked one

Oooh, saspirilla.
ahws
shed*

fisticuffs
He has his fists out becuase he MAD
MAD ABOUT LOOTING
And I bet he is punching that keyboard right now
yeah i always use hex redactor to search some random ascii words for password
this is how real man do
you sounds like after good drunk party
i knew it :D
now find a bucket and rob him blind
brb
here i am
MirrorImage: That works on skyrim, not sure about fallout :D
i know, but it's Bethesda all the same
bad thing about fallout is fighting i think but i still love game
ouo - VATS + Fat Boys makes all combat interesting
vats?
eeeew
hey, it's not like I could hit that gecko square in the face that charged me from nowhere
so if i reflex-activate VATS, i'm going to murder it in the face
I think it would be better if you can turn pause but not only to chose there to shot
i think it should be like in KOTOR
well, bringing up the Pipboy pauses you as well
for things like using items and changing weapons
(and putting on a suit of Power Armor in the middle of combat)
why she is following you?
Happy Kwanzaa!
boom headshot!
hi everypony
That's an... interesting breed of gecko.
Killer geckos... those by the same guys who gave us African Killer Bees?
200 years of radiation-led evolution will do that
morning everypony :)
wrek stream?
Good morning cachi01 and yep :)

cachi01: sent it to cachisebas
Sure, use a sledgehammer against the mantis. Not overkill at all. XD
technically it's a shovel
Oh... carry on.
though i prefer to just boot them
"Left leg crippled"
which one?
/me takes MirrorImage to bed for punishment
MirrorImage: All of them!
Bronysith - sure you can handle all of me?
Now is time to make up to my family name and face full life consequences
(also torturing myself in Bayonetta
yes, nothing like the zest that a little necrosis adds
suddenly wild scorpio appears
Call me weird, but I'm not really a fan of necrosis in my food. A little to zesty for my tastes.
well, that's a Bethesda game for you...
quick use pokeball
Is that doing anything at all? XD
uhmmm my xbox just turned red
not a bit gildash
i thought the sbos 360 S didnt have that fucking problem

3 was Washington DC; 4 is Vegas
3 was washington Dc?

Yea
hence, "Capital" Wasteland
oh.
xD
You didn't notice that?
halt criminal scum!!
Fallout: London :3
zombiU
Fallout will never get to London
i would suggest Fallout Russia, but evidently living there is already like playing Fallout
fallout cernoble?
Fallout Russia:D
Fallout Canada
dat jaymoo here?
so what quest is wrek doing
get on with it
hacking computers
like a baws

NV was Vegas, 4 is massachussets
Vivix - most people consider NV "4"
its fine if you dont
but it's not four, four is in planning now I believe the rumour is
Vegas is an unofficial 4
Can't remember who said it, but it was someone here who said four is in dev/prep
Did Wrek crash again?
Well, kindof, but the count is 1 2 bos and that horrible ps game, 3 nv and now four in a few years
Creepy

Word of advice, never give your Ex a roofie
i dont do that stuff?
Just saying
oh god///
i thought i\of something disturbing just now
when and if i get that blanket i willl wash it./..
when i get home
tommorow
Your Ex is a dude right?
DerpyMuffins: aniderp_work is a girl
No shit Bronysith, he's asking if her ex-boyfriend is a guy, but the answer is obvious.
Get your shit together.
yea my ex bf is a boy
You don't require Sherlock Holmes to figure this out.
jaymoo :>
i showed my hoodie right?
i forgot if i did...
Hey all.
Ohai Mattcrowley2a :)
well i gotta work now
bai
Bye aniderp_work :)
there needs to be more final fantasy fighting games
Indeed.
DerpyMuffins: Linus from Peanuts:p
teh peanuts is so depressing
same
a playstation vita <3
I am not jealous.
I need to get rid of my vita... I barely used it :I
meh i think i lost it
sorry
Err Wii and PS3 games
what game>
?**
I feel like we all don't always get what we do desire most of the time.
CrystalPhoenix: Epic Mickey 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Full Frontal Assualt
interesting
Getting anything at all is nice enough
Mattcrowley2a, be happy with what they give you, consider yourself lucky you're in such a comfortable life
I got tickets to festival, very content~
Vivix: yay~
can i tag along?
Welp, you'd have to supply your own ticket, and endure hours of indierock
VioletGreySha: Exactly. My parents can't afford many gifts anymore so I can only ask for a few. Thankfully those two games were pretty much all I wanted. Don't want a WiiU just yet
Tab fail
Did you mean me? If so, yeah, We never had much money growing up, but getting anything is really nice
and giving is reaaally nice-
That response was to Vivix
:3

I'm afraid of care bears

:P
:D

yes

nope
me too
oh the game
just five min's ago
yes
my friend was talking about that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npBowNYDfg
ApplejackSwag, you can stop talking
and now 10 hours
i keep failing epickly
lol
you know that kind of thing is forbided to talk about in here
like the word epickily
You mean "epicly", right?
yeah
05keep the discussion of that shitpile out of here
like ga-
legendary_brony: how can you fail at that game?
I just found out about how the stream got hacked during the one bad apple episode
sup cachio
the race
hijacked
sup AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
:)
/me got every hidden scene
05ApplejackSwag: why do you say it was hacked? it wasnt hacked
and i need to be unicorn for trixie
seems like the conversations starting to pick up
nah
ok jeesh
05as stated on the post we made on the frontpage
realy wish I could join in the artist training grounds this time around but I lack a scaner
05it was a hijack caused by the stream provider at the time having the key visible for all to use
chack this out then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ9vWulShds
05lolstream or whatever their name was did it to get traffic
hello everyone :)
hello everypony
hey lilb!
hey Lil_B
/me spots a Lil_B
05ApplejackSwag: its still nto a hack dimwit
/me takes Lil_B to bed
I liked when they played Swiggity Swag
oh sorry Wrek
Bronysith no to the Bed NOT THE BED AHHHHH
ApplejackSwag: quick question: are u fagestia?
*/tp legendary_brony Bronystate*
O.o
thanks AssertiveFluttershy1 ApplejackSwag and Bronysith :)
no
cachi01: i think this bastard is ban evading
:)

i'm not 1
Bronysith: i also think so
oh hi Lil_B :)
aloa cachi01 :)
cachi01: dissidia needs a port to the ps3
indeed it does
love the song that I have on
T~T
this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npBowNYDfg who first posted that?
on the stream
Hay bacon strips?
ouo posted that here before today
a few minutes ago
yeah
I think I finally should do what I have to do... If you take to long to finish a song, delete it, because your artistic flow will nopt come back... must delete all my Projects now :/
i love it
Lil_B: That's not a very good idea...
I linked the song before
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I delete songs all the time
it's in those MLP commercial
Or just restart
HHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG
GilDash actually, it is actually, especially for a beginner like me
:P
Like our teacher said, kill your darlings is an important thing to learn, so good on you Lil_B
Vivix I have about 30 songs, and I know I will not finish one of them anyway :/
it sucks, but it can help
Lil_B: I'm a writer. I might give up on projects, but I always keep them around. You'd be amazed at what can inspire you from old material, and it's nice to reflect once in a while.
it's been awhile since i've been on the chat
ya know
That's true too, but you have songs where you know, this isn't good enough, I can't finish this, and deleting them is something that's important to learn
Hey, in 1 of the pictures, theres a pony
Vivix got this advice from a really nice speaker, I may have to kill Stilöl I was working on for hours, but at least I gained knowsledge :/ ... and some presets xD
hehe yeah
Though, I would hide them away, rather than fully demolish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaTNrauAcB4 have you heard this yet?
listening to them again in 5 months might be nice to hear progress
05brony music annoys me nowadays
GilDash yeah, but writing isn't exactly like composing (though very similar) but it really helps startsing over again, it can be to complex when you resatart and your idea is just gone
why
05its all wananbe wubstep remixes
^
^^^^
05the original songs are still nice
I only listen to a few artists, never really liked remixes
heres a nice song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2lncdgW3QA
Wrek since when have you made that realization?
if I hear a nice pony song in the show, I avoid all remixes
I think this was the first remix
05CrystalPhoenix: since halfway through S2
Now a days, there are remixes of remixes
ApplejackSwag, that's just offspring sped up
I never liked remixes though, outside of pony
Wrek I don't listen to Brony music... and I'm incabable of doing wubs anyways, I ttry to make some nice synth, use real instrumentss, or Chipstunes
:D
I still say this is one of the best around https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk
Lil_B: It's all a creative artform. If you never keep what you know is wrong, how can you know for sure you've ever improved?
Thats it, I am not going to the Bronypalloza panel
I would keep them, but I'd take them out of your WIP folder, Lil_B
it's nice to hear your old stuff
I still have some of my first songs
GilDash that's the Problem, this was not the only thing the speaker said, there was another important thing thew guy said
m?
Vivix me too, I have such a Folder :)
Lil_B: yay chiptunes =D
Lil_B: What 'speaker' and what 'guy'?
GilDash erm... I can link you the Video, he just keeps giving good advice for beginners
.............................
pokehidden also do some normal art c: and i like it
05i still need to download all of S2
^ oh nooo i was too late
05i jstu havent been arsed
I like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDdL4z5qfr4
S2?
http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23550911.jpg
lol
Lil_B: I just disagree with throwing stuff away if you've worked hard on it, that's all. Sure, archive it away in some box that you will take forever to find again, but if you remove it you can lose more than you know when you do so.
ApplejackSwag, song is catchy but meh overall the animation is glorious
ikr
GilDash anyway he also said, that, if you finished a song, leave it in that state, don't send it to friends or Stuzff and wait for their feedback, when you say "It's done" than it's done, and that's the version you upload, and than you try better next time
GilDash yeah, I will keep tham in the WIP or ABandoned folder
well i'll talk to you guys later
I should go to Bronystate....
gotta go
Lil_B: True. If you try to constantly improve things you never finish it.
cya AssertiveFluttershy1 :)
When as ong is done, it is done, I never go back unless I rerecord them for a new project
isn't bronystate off break now?
yep
i think it is
but also, leave it for abot a day and then listen to it again
might be
Wrek: just finished streamig some fallout NV
your ears are tired when you've been working
if you have a tumblr and go on pony ask blogs do you know anynonymous
Vivix yeah that too
but yeah, done is done is a great advice
Vivix do you wanna see the Video?
Im going to the dentist because my eyes hurt and i cant hear a thing
sure, I'll put it on to watch though
lel
brb
When I went to school we had a lot of speakers on songwriting and stuff
BBQ
one thing still sticks with me, First impression is something you can never have again, so it can be hard to hear the first impression of your own song, and an intro can break your song
Vivix it's long, but it's good in my opinion, but you may already know this things anyway http://youtu.be/XVQ8c19unnM
I like AC/DC
/me puts in to watch
and turtles
I've grown fond of grunge, like- Melvins and Mudhoney, and Motorpsycho the past few months
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbWFaI3d9D8 the voices aren't that great but that animation <3
...
anypony there?
me
okay
Ill methodology- never heard of IllGatesmusic, but I'll be sure to watch it
*forever alone face*
/me strokes the forever alone face
Windows 8
nice
amazon gift card and gloves
wii u, zombi U, scribblenauts unlimited, 100 dollars
wow
Nice
cachi01 got the same, except the WiiU, ZombiU and scribblenauts
legendary_brony: awesome
yeah
or should say YEEEEEAAAHHH
was it windows 8
yes
How do you like 8?
my brothers got the same
Do you miss the start menu?
its confusing me but i like it
yes
so are any admins on?
yes
whens next stream?
2 days i think
They're unschedueled
oh
sooo its just us 3?
hai
/me aves
nvm
hello
hai jcelios
nvm again
128 pokemans
Vivix though, one point he makes is that collaborating with others is a nice way to improve on a lot of things... but I can't find anyone :/
6 of us
If I were a pony I'd be a Pegasus named Fire Drizzle
well, I've yet to collaborate in pony world, but school was all abot collaboration
or alicorn
if i was a pony id be a black pegasus named night wing
I think collaboration over the internet sounds difficult, but I'd like to try it some day
I'd be an alicorn named Omega Black and started a harem
and fight goku
with a scar and bitten ear
yup
jcelios: dont forget being a lost broher of celestia
legendary_brony, don't forget the red mane
now *this* is what I call collaboration
I'd have a fire blue coat & lime green mane with black highlights
its actually blue but you knoow
I wonder if Falvie could make an alicorn oc look good
Vivix I know some people near me whomake music too, but I just never really come together with asnyone to collaborater :/ maybe I should just speak with them :/
maybe- you know them?
the scar on my left eye and bitten left ear
Jamming and impro is a great way to test your skills and get a feel for who you are in music
my cutie mark is a blue fire ball with lighting striking it
:)
I love my OC
I think mine would be a flash drive
:D
he has a transparent coat with invisible mane
so your good with computers
cutie mark: sorta of a guardian's emblem
Id like to think so.
I'd like mine to be the stereotypical G-Key
Vivix 2 of them are in my class, but both have a lot of other things to do and don't have much time, and the last one is in my village, but I don't have that much of a connection to him and he also has a rather busy life
you know
who's your favorite background pony?
*guardians angel emblem
I personally think it's very odd to have a tool as a cutiemark
applejack
background
probably Derpy
applejack
Does derpy count?
Aah, well- collaboration online is another way to learn, I'm not very sociable, but you could probably find a music club or- hangout to meet people to play with
a cutie mark tool? To remove cutie marks?
yes
octavia
like in real life, but you could also try online, just to see how it is
mine is Rose Luck
http://oi45.tinypic.com/1hv9t.jpg one does not simply beat my oc
legendary_brony, sup
Hi guys!
OMG
haha
omg wtf
Autistic kids have OCs
cachi01, Tracy is better
*pass out*
?
...
cachi01: :D
oh
right
Vivix I tried, but on the Internet is really just a matter of how hard you try, there are enough on mylittleremix... it jkust sucks that LMMS can't transform something into MIDI, I need someone who also uses LMMS
or this oc i made for thelonepony http://oi50.tinypic.com/33m2wkp.jpg
sorry I don't follow this channel usually
got pinged
also my favorite Background pony might be Lyra
don't I bet you guys, you cannot guess why
Lil_B, really? Hm, yeah- technical is also an issue, you could do audiojams though, without midi at all
i dont follow fox news
like the oldschool tapejams-
Merry Boxing Day everypony! :)
but this drawing i made for twilight_sprinkles is also amazing https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A9Y9JNZCYAAWZP-.jpg:large
cachi01: It looks just like him :D
Ohai Socks! :)
ikr

Heyo MLP_Brovakiin How is life ATM?
welp time for some more torture
Vivix could try that, doesn't know much about them, I see how it goes :)
Socks: Good thanks, you? :)
hello Socks
MLP_Brovakiin: very very good :)
You lay down tracks and just export them in audio, and they lay down stuff on top of it, and maybe arrange some, and you send it back and forth and discuss
Hey Lil_B :)
*reaction to my little dashie* :'(
ohh...
Socks: Good to hear :3
Vivix ahh, ok :/
Wait, Octavia, are you the former mod Octavia?

Punkie_Pue: Just good comunity really, generall goodness
o hai mark
Making breakfast so..am a bit idly
/me spells badly get over it
I dont know of any public servers that are good
probably some good whitelist ones out there
Yeah!
Thats your best bet
but usually a closed community can make it weird to enter as the new person
Or get some friends who play and rent a server.
oK, i'll start checking out Whitelist stuff
cool
i type really slow compared to other people....
Bronies in london think it's odd I'm a scottish Brony
Punkie_Pue: We already have, but it's not vanilla
Oh i see. what the appeal with vanilla?
Punkie_Pue: CBA to learn tekkit :P

Holy shit it is even capless
Punkie_Pue: not as cool as the other one though
Vivix, I've been warned on other rules for less
Does he think he's clever for doing that or what?
I wouldn't know, I've only been warned once
im still wondering if i should play demonophobia >.>
/me thought it said demonophilia
cachi01, seriously what the buck
Vivix: lel

Punkie_Pue: Super Spaghetti tbh

friedship was sugar

^
sonicdude558: thats it, Bronies are Furries then. it means they watch anime.
sonicdude558: arent you one? you been bringing up Fursuits all the time
thelonecubone: I had spaghetti for dinner tonight ^w^
MLP_Brovakiin: D: lucky ;3;

thelonecubone, I admire fursuits in a good way
Look at it this way, no fursuits, no Narnia

i had oxygen last night.... it was good until i released carbon dioxide
Oxygen is overrated.
''dad i just came out of the closet''

''son''
''tell me how is narnia''
a girl walks into a wardrobe thing, and she falls asleep at the amount of fursuits inside of it

If you go through the RPG category in steam, tehre's tons of games that- probably should never have been called RPG there-
Punkie_Pue: for you
Yes.
Any of the mane 6 or the princesses.
/me imagines Pinkie Pie bouncing all around the resturant

6Evening
I just noticed YouTube nowlets anyone download any video without any extra equipment. That's going to make snatching all the TV shows easier...
J_E_Smith71: really?
how?
legendary_brony: You're gonna have to wait a year for that :I
i know
J_E_Smith71: how?
J_E_Smith71: You get to date G3 rainbow Dash
:'(
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-npBowNYDfg
lol rainbow dash always dresses in style
DAHLING
its time
to giddy up
cachi01: There's now a Download Video button next to the Like buttons
ouo: You get King Sombra as a date
i finshed watching that
yay /)^3^(\
DRHUnleashed: You get to date all the seaponies.
I dont see a download button
J_E_Smith71: cant find it
Youtube might make it available based on region
I had the new layou for a month or so before it went live, you might need to be in the html5 beta as well
Meth always comes up with interesting names
What region are you from J_E_Smith71?
i'm unsure whether this is a good thing or not
or actually, i'll play some GTA4 ^w^
cachi01: I'm wondering if its something to do with my account
Rex_Mundi, he's too shy :\ doesn't talk much
it might also need to be enabled by the uploader
J_E_Smith71: maybe
6Meth?
yeah, hes a new guy that has been coming here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWtO0cfgewY cant find the button in here
Id rather date cray pinki- * remembers Cupcakes* never mind
I can't see it either, I'm in html5 beta and region europe north
Every video I'm looking at has the button so fat
far
I'm in the US
Id date Rarity
could it be a plugin?
so you think rarity= best pony
/me pokes sombra
Probably region
but rarity is best pony
I have g3 rarity according to Rex_Mundi
legendary_brony: The mane6 are equally best pony
All ponies are created equally.
silver spoon is best pony
Except earth ponies
I adore Silver Spook and Diamond-
^
Spoon*
earth ponies are slaves
I feel earth ponies kind of got screwed
pics
well, Earth Ponies are really strong, they are equal in ability
but it's a joke that goes around
Earth ponies are more in thouch with nature n. stuff. They are ponyverse elevs kinda
alright, ill try taking a pic of it later today
Wonder if its a plugin on this laptop I'm using
i thought ponies fight with power of friendship
They are also seemingly (so far) the only ones who can cultivate plants and earth
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRNzhOhE6sQ
I've yet to see anyone else actually grow something, but I don't know for sure
they are the most independable becuae they are in charge of food pegasus andunicorns are not.
Harry Potter is gay >_>
helllo
Celestia= Slave driver
herro
Yay! I would like to have Spyro plush too.
no really
he's fag
*Trollestia
What can unicorn magic not do?
okay, somethings wrong with my Xbox 360 D:
D:
Whats wrong thelonecubone?
o no
thelonecubone: same here
I have one already :D
The whole thing that people are saying that Twilight will become an Alicorn, doesnt that work with the other ponies. Can a pegasus become an Alicorn, or an earth pony? Its one of the reasons why i dislike that Twilight Alicorn theory.
You can buy them on ebay
thelonecubone: You ateed it :3
thelonecubone i know what wrong
thelonecubone: it went red
thelonecubone it's xbox :D
http://www.amazon.com/Skylanders-Giants-Personalized-Edible-Image/dp/B009KOYTQ8/ref=pd_sbs_t_4
thelonecubone: god knows how but. it suddenly went red.
and its an S
I have never seen something like this before
4 red or 3 red?
We'll see Rex, we'll see
just put towel thats how i fixed mine
I personally don't think she will, but we'll see
cachi01: no, sounds like it was chewing on something
I finally found all the Skylanders merchandise in stores
Guess I just wasn't looking hard enough
kidding but i never buy a single game for that
Punkie_Pue: my brother says it was 4
yeah i'm too bad :\
burn it with fire http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Skylanders-Giants-Spyro-Portal-Action-9-5-Plush-Purple-Dragon-Lights-Sounds-/251203007613?pt=US_Action_Figures&hash=item3a7cddb47d&_uhb=1#ht_500wt_1304
Or they only recently got it in
This is that button that shows up for me: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/J.E.Smith/youtubedownloadbutton_zps11db7dde.png
4 means the av cable is bad
Punkie_Pue: my xbox 360 had 3 and i died
Punkie_Pue: uhmmm its hdmi
can still be bad
Yeah I was just going to say
Punkie_Pue: and its an xbox 360 S
*daydreams of Octavia*

Hey thelonecubone :$
Then, after about 7 days of my torrid affair with the Galaxy S3, it came to a screeching halt, when my phone (which was nestled safely in my robe pocket… or so I thought), came flying out of that pocket as if it had grown some kind of consciousness, and landed itself right in the toilet
MadSurge: http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/post/37445812704/what-japan-thinks-of-mlp122-with-timestamps
I did indeed, MadSurge! How about you??
:D
I had a nice relaxing day :) - I might be in trouble later, but worth it!
RaveBrony: had a huge feast with my relatives, played with my little cousin, got a brand new laptop... yes I did!
Rex_Mundi: thanks a lot!
MadSurge: Awesome! :o
In the rainbow factory, where fears and horros come true.
this little horsie kissing me
My grandpa signed a new contract and got a galaxy s3
a week later he smashed it
giddy up giddy up giddy up up
by accident of course...
In the rainbow factory, where not a single soul gets through
but that sort of sucks, $250 to replace a busted screen
snowing here.
I almost killed my S2 with wet laundry
Funniest fan fic I've ever read
One thing I noticed using Google translate, is that names get warped translated back into english. Selestia become "Seresutia"
but it recovered somehow
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24941/the-fraternal-brotherhood-of-mann
Celestia become Seresutia, I mean
O_o
samsung phones are usually really resilliant
Are the screens glass?
but if they get hit in just the right place....
yes, gorilla glass I believe.
Why is Sumicas OC pony so sexy?

What was I gonna do?.. alright... homework.

Ponyguy*
My grandpa cooked his mobilephone on a stove and it still worked after that. It was some very old model which had an anntena and 2 color display :)
I destroyed on of my phones' screens that ways
*way
yeah those old phones were unbreakable
yeah
my parents used to have them
I always asked to borrow them to play snake :P
:D
lol old nokia snake
haha I remember snake
its still a fun game
i still remember the ringtones from those phones
not because I had one but because my parents did,
You think they'll ever say who Celestia and Luna's parents are
Doubtful
same thing with AJ

I couldn't see big mac the same after that
Ponyguy Yes and i suggest stopping there cause rules say no gorefics talk here
those faces on those phones creep me out
the below person below me is typing in english
Ponyguy I strongly suggest you read the rules and FAQ if you haven't
told ya
my dad said shut the fuck giddy up
:\
I remember that ringtone

I still like the first original one the best
Hey guys. I'm on the road, and IT IS BRUTAL OUT HERE!
yeah the original is still good
the person below me is a brony
I'm a brony
Ponyguy: Celestia & Luna's parents are as of yet, unknown, but I have my suspiscions - Sun & Moon - Time & Space
what road?
"Last week, we ran a post with advice for families bringing kids to visit Santa, written by a former mall Santa who got the job despite being skinny, thirtyish, and Jewish."
legendary_brony what if I turn my Monitor upside down?
Kandarihu: Stay safe. Hoping you have a safe trip, if not pleasant.
umm damn i dint think abou that
oh
http://consumerist.com/2012/12/26/it-really-is-a-business-why-taking-your-own-santa-visit-pictures-makes-you-a-cheap-jerk/
wow that would be embarassing.
taking your own photos in their set and paying them nothing
stay safe Kandarihu :)
what a cheap ass.
what road ?!
wait its still a brony
lol
I gotta start staying in one place for more than 5 minutes...too much back log to go through...

its a paddlin
anyways time to get out of bed..
I love that topic name
who wnt to be a gremmar nazi?
Grammar*
who wants a flugel horn?
*want
Heil grammar!
/me salhoofs
Heil grammar!
I never did those Santa visits as a kid
/me carries AdamTheDuck to bed
i want a flugelhorn
cee ya
I did
a few times
My parents never taught us to believe in Santa
who else wants a flugel horn?
i don't know anything bout Ü :P
i want a flugel horn!!
I wouldn't teach my kids about santa
When I tell people this they usually say something like "OMG how did you have a childhood!?"
I dont think its cute or funny.
but it seemed perfectly normal
Bronysith, funny you should say that, I'mma head back to sleep, just woke up to check downloads :P
Ponies nuff said
AdamTheDuck xD hello and sleep well
Id rather tell them the truth as to give myself more creditability when they are older.
yeah, im pretty dry :P
lol
Sleep well AdamTheDuck :3
that was my parents' reasoning, makes sense
http://curezone.com/upload/_A_Forums/Ask_Ana/Ana_Fun/Thats_a_paddlin.jpg
yeah totally.
I think in season 4 they should get an hour time slot.
sleep tight dont let the bedbugs kill ya slowly
This year my mom put icing sugar on the floor and told my little sister that santa was here
good evening
Im like... since when does santa throw icing sugar all over?
Bye AdamTheDuck :)
wow
i think g5 should get 18+ rate
Ohai ekips :)
Hohoho, have fun cleaning up your house!
Thats just original though
she does funny things like that.
Hi ekips :)
never heard anyone doing that
/me dances in a gala suit
:P
and she put celery and said santa took a bite of the celery
Im like... since when does santa want celery?
and been showed after 11 00 pm o////o
If all your snacks end up missing in the house blame santa
he's on a diet
thats what she said.
and I just responded with "unlikely."
I think we should have more 2 parters.
My mom is funny though, she just wants to make things fun in her own way
Bronysith: Nice suit :)
I demand a MLP Movie... but I want to finally get an a compelling non-stereotypical villian, some actrion and Characterdevelopment.
Lil_B: you wont get that with the current writers
Well get a moive when the mlp fandom starts to decline
Bronysith yeah, S3 really disappointed me so far...
Alright. I don't see any way to charge my battery, and I'm down to about 28%. So I'll see you next time I stop off somewhere else. I hope I can recharge the battery.
how come Lil_B
Kandarihu: See you around. :)
Lil_B: so far it has been just fanservice and action since the season 2 finale
no character development or good writing
alexxm|colt the Writing, it has become really predictable and/or Fanservice
just, fanservice and action
SPitefires character was all over the place if i recall
sometimes I wish Spyrochat was not called Spyrochat
So kids wouldn't come in thinking we only talk about Spyro and nothing else
What would you call it?
I dunno :P
at least applejack has a song...but they friggin put no effort into it
I didn't think the song was bad.
I would actually call this episode with the Wonderbolts not so bad, but man, you saw that "Lesson" coming from a mile away, and the way they just kinda kicked Lightnighdust out was rather uneventful
btw, when was the last time you actually had someone qwriting a letter to the Princess?
I don't really think we should change it
Lil_B: Uh, last episode, actually. XD
Lil_B: only applejack and pinkie pie so far this season
GilDash damnit... before that?
but it would probably get rid of that
We are getting more newcomers
I think the skylanders generation is a bit too young right now
most of them figure out pretty quick that we're not all about Spyro
Lil_B: No idea. XD
Yeah
Lil_B: in the pinkie pie episode
And I don't blame them, but some kids that young just shouldn't be on the internet
and applejack, that is it the entire fucking season
...Ever thought about an episode about a villain that camed straight from "Heck"? ...*Cough* The PG-rated way to say "Hell".
only 2 letters this season
Applejacks Episode was horrible for me to watch, I just can't stand easily avoidable awkwardness
there are much worse things than someone making fun of your favorit video game
if they can't even take that...
Lil_B: eh, the studio hates applejack remember?
You know you enjoyed it
Lil_B: Disregard Applejack; Aquire Braeburn.
enjoyed what?
making that kid mad?
yeah
Okay, if you guys wanted a episode that can makes your jaws drop like no tomorrow, then why don't you listen to MY idea?
well maybe enjoy is not the best word to use
well I dunno
but you said you missed it
Bronysith I don't think they hate anyone, judging by how I saw the episodes, but they write it just poorly >.< like giving rarity actual generosity
that was 95% sarcasm :P
VenHur I had a Good Idea once, but I forgot it :P
You enjoy sarcasm
:D
now that is definitely true
although I wish it was easier to detect on the internet
VenHur: Haven't they already got Tarturus?
Well Lil_B, my idea is an "jumping the shark in an cosmic sort of way"ish idea, and yes, it's a two-parter...
I tend to miss the sarcasm often
VenHur xD
I think you have to know the person really well
like if it's something they would obviously never say, it's probably sarcasm
https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6878859008/hFC420297/
You see, 1000 years ago, ANOTHER villain named Diablo, a monstrous 50ft demon that clarrifed to many as "The King of All Sins", or "The Demon King" had broken from his prisonment one day.
i just realized something, It was that little box that keeps the power for the xbox :$
On that day, Diablo requested a challenge to the Mane 6, if they would won, Diablo would be sent to the sun to be burned to the crisp.
VenHur will there be a Cow Level like in Diabolo?
And if Diablo wons...well, let's just say that until death, EVERY single ponies in Equestria will bowed down to thier new overlord, even Celestia herself.
And I DO means, EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
errrrr... okey...
...So...how's my idea?
unimaginable for MLP xD
Lil_B: Is that Fiona, the R63 version of Finn?
but now I remembered my Idea I had : D
because it does look like her :D
thelonecubone why do you ask me something about r63?! ... btw, I think so
Hey, at least my episodic idea is as grimdark as A Canterlot Wedding, hell, maybe it can goe BEYOND that standards.
Ponies aren't exactly grimdark though. That's not the point of the show.

Random Trivia: All Main Console Zelda Gmes used the same Engine since the Wind Waker up to Skyward Sword, just minor tweaks were done
Random Nintendo Logic Theory: Why can't brick that Mario breaks hurts his head?
*bricks
because he attacks their Weakpoint for massive damage
Another Random Nintendo Theory: If Mario felled down a hole in the Overworld, shouldn't that one hole leads straight to the Underworld?
nope, the holes usually have no connection to the underworld, the ceiling in the underworlds are usually void of holes in them
13mario punches blocks, not his head
^ that too, if you looks very closly at screenshots
it would still hurt to punch blocks
made of fuggin brick
Shizuka: Still, if you punched a block in the real world, it would of clenchs your hand. And really, that is painful.
13mario eats a mushroom and grows larger
13i don't think his hand cares
hey
hi amu-chan and spyrofan
right he can usually only brake blocks >(in the old games) when he's Super Mario

This chat, this derpy chat, this band of bronies
since you wanted to see when i was at work..
(Note: The use of realize as opposed to realized is intentional, I knew the whole time I wasn't good, I just didn't feel like I could progress as a writer, which is why I stopped)

That's a caution attached to the VGA cable that was provided with my new monitor...
Lil_B: Its not technicly homework. But for my cass its complete at your own pace, so i can do some of the classwork at home so I can graduate earlier, so thats what im doing.
