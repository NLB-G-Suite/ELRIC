Wow
I saw plushies at walmart the otherday.

I never see them anywhere
they quality wasn't that great.
Except online
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ2UWzsm3pc exclusive to walmart.
i got a bag with rainbow dash and derpy
lol
http://sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/188691_10151196863361840_1303346696_n.jpg
i also got a derpy toy!
That's cool
thats awesome.
when i got the bag and the derpy toy i was squealing with delight! lol
I saw that rainbow Dash hoodie.
I think It had the rest of the mane six, but I didnt see
its tiny
yes it is
a ;lot of detail though.
i hope it does
lol http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/mowza2k2/Merch/RainbowDashToeSocks.jpg
I want those socks
*_*
and merry xmas
I saw them at a hot topic in nh
Kids are spoiled.....
^
I said KIDS were spoiled
Aaaah
I also got Regular Show toys
They're not all spoiled...
I'm expected to get my little sister something......
A lot of them are though, yeah...
Yea, but I want to get her something nice
golly
it felt....odd
^
That's like my family xD
I'd hate to do this...
All you get is money
I'd want money for a gift
If everyone gave each other money; everyone would just about break even. XD
I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.
lol unicorn meat http://www.amazon.com/ThinkGeek-Canned-Unicorn-Meat/dp/B004CRYE2C/ref=pd_sim_t_1
:'(
I really only got one joke pony gift this year.
Twilight nooo
I contacted the seller, they assured me it was a background unicorn.
Trixie meat.....
Hmmm
interesting thought...
You know... I can't think of a single thing I'd buy in a garden centre. Doesn't help that this house doesn't have any gardens...
how about a spade?
... Not going to help with concrete. XD
Maybe not.
Maybe I could buy a pressure hose? That's good for cleaning concrete, right?
A pressure hose?
YOu mean like a power washer?
Aye, like a power washer.
yeah, that a good idea.
Although this is all achedemic. I'm not going anywhere near a garden centre unless I can help it. XD
though with giftcards, getting it cheaper elsewhere isn't important, as it's free for you anyway, and you can get mall-wide giftcards
Then in that case you've got to go to a specific mall. Also, if we're going that way, money you get given is technically free to you as well.
yeah
and no not specific mall, it's cooperation thing-
like "This mall + these shops"
Not sure we have anything like that in the UK. Or, at least, I've not heard of it and never bothered checking.
I never heard about it until I got it
:)
It's like I've really got to focus on typing that one word. XD
hehe
Is odd yeah
okey dokey all
have to disconnect my monitor for travel
I'll be leaving

Pretty good
Dancing with stars is always difficult. You can manage only one step before you burn up.
well it is chrsitmas
I was thinking about trying to come up with another challenge for Spyro. Do you think anyone cares about them anymore?
tfw I'm watching this at the exact same time on the exact same channel.
Film4 ftw
UK TV uber alles.
I might if I had enough time for one
I watch the Extended edition about twice a year
Challenge?
Neo, http://www.spyroforum.com/forum-spyro-contests.html
I still need to finish watching all of them, but procastionation -_-
Why is the forum still open?
because I didn't have time to draw anything
k
I'm kind of sad about it actually
but oh well
You're sad that no one does them anymore?
Unless I get kicked out for being too old by then
:P
watch the extended version RotK with the actor's commentary on tis hilarious
ANYTHING.

Anything you say

I think '08
he's streaming from tv
Hey bronies/ponies! :) Merry Xmas!
Saruman is like I hate when he does that
they sell books on itunes?
It was a 3 year tradition
Nice
a wild ad appears
FURBY! KILL IT!
well, i'm not looking at stream atm
helping someone atm
dawwww
but that's where tv stations get their money from
no other way around
tv pays for the ability to air shows
well depends on the show :P
commercials pay to get on tv
must've been '07 then
Because I drew 3 pictures
And one got reused one year
they'll buy it
Forgot to do the electricity
wat was that
and the forum was founded in '06
aw :(
BILBO!
I'd imagine they'd get a cut
but like you said
probably from advertising the merchandise
I'm not sure- I know simpsons get a rerun pay, and if you have origina lcharacter in that episode you get character pay or writer pay-
yeah

It actually divides userspaces into different logins, sort of like a computer with multiple users
go home frodo, you are high
08,01Dark_Horst: you were truncated at "this seem", hun
Not sure about the 360
Previous Wii had nothing like that though
Yea
08,01chat needs more naked..
Saturn: O U
and you cannot get out
Saturn but... I'm already :/
You could put some data in individual Miis, like Wii Sports statistics
But it doesn't let you do anything else
08,01naked germans are best germans.
there'S the rest
/me 08,01is slightly drunk

The Wii U is much more like PSN actually

well hopefully they'll start packaging them with those updates preinstalled ._.
08,01my brother: "not in those tights he's not"
There are other smaller updates when you run the channels that take a few minutes
fun-Trivia, IE 9 has something Similar as Adblock Plus Implemented, Easylist is available for this too, just look through the Options and enjoy Ad-free IE9
Saturn: how does elf with pitcher translate to hunting?=
I thought it couldnt
ewwwww IE
It's supposedly backwards compatible with the Wii, and there is a Wii menu available.
Yea
it really sucks
08,01so they're all wearing tights
My Wii is pretty much just used as a Gamecube
:P
still not getting the hunting
IE nuke it from orbit for it is the only way to be sure
08,01Dark_Horst: he's got a crossbow
he does?
didnt see that
08,01Dark_Horst: because you're watching lord of the rings...
Can finally purchase the gamecube games I've never had :P

For some reason its not letting me switch my nick
I try not to be douchy. Whether I succeed or not is another matter entirely. :D
Oh, and to pick up the gifts I have for the kids in the clan.
My brother just downloaded Playstation all stars with the PSN card I gave him
we were just playing that
Since I am still young, I got a crapload. U jelly?
and now we're off to another relative's house, be back later :D
Yeah. At my age and pathetic health, all I really want is my old teeth back-- that's not happening any time soon.
dontchu worry, i got this
as well as the fact that he broke the rules
Also, doesn't !cd give the episode name anyway?
Yes but that ep is first out jan 19th? i think
I read it earlier...Crap, no saying nothing...But it excited me slightly....-prepares for moon launch-
anyone with a good client that can
everyone with any client can
I think you can on webclient too, not sure
Ajax is in lightirc, it does
Ajax ≠ lightIRC
in anyway
They're not bundled?
ok. thank goodness, i havent seen the leaked episodes
yeah !cd reveales name, which is kind of annoying to some of us-
they do to some, but very few

?*
or wat?
Cost
and gb as well :P
idk i bought the complete pack lol
whats the difference with the limited edition
Zelda died for me after Wii :<
oh
and i think its 800 mb
just opposing force
800 mb, not bad
^
oh, well :P
lel
Gameplay wasn't the right word. I meant the whole dancing around to move thing
I already rage enough when I'm stuck in Zelda. Fiddling with the movements would only add to the rage
we dont know yet
we just have to wait till E3 2013
but i hope they add wii u pro controller compability

I never liked remixes though, outside of pony
:D
I still say this is one of the best around https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk

Grammar*
*want
Heil grammar!
/me salhoofs
Heil grammar!
i want a flugelhorn
why do I think it's aktually "Flügel Horn" but the americans just thought "skrew the Ü and their Pronounciation, but let's keep the word around anyways"
cee ya
I did
a few times
i don't know anything bout Ü :P
When I tell people this they usually say something like "OMG how did you have a childhood!?"
but it seemed perfectly normal
Ponies nuff said
Id rather tell them the truth as to give myself more creditability when they are older.
lol
that was my parents' reasoning, makes sense
http://curezone.com/upload/_A_Forums/Ask_Ana/Ana_Fun/Thats_a_paddlin.jpg
yeah totally.
I think in season 4 they should get an hour time slot.
sleep tight dont let the bedbugs kill ya slowly
good evening
wow
i think g5 should get 18+ rate
never heard anyone doing that
:P
and been showed after 11 00 pm o////o
he's on a diet
and I just responded with "unlikely."
I think we should have more 2 parters.
no character development or good writing
just, fanservice and action
SPitefires character was all over the place if i recall
sometimes I wish Spyrochat was not called Spyrochat
I dunno :P
at least applejack has a song...but they friggin put no effort into it
I didn't think the song was bad.
I don't really think we should change it
but it would probably get rid of that
We are getting more newcomers
Yeah
