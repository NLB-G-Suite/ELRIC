I sure wont.
Vivix: It's a shame but I think I'll survive
one simply does not miss a MLP episode
yeah~~ it'll be all over the net to catch later
Vivix: That's my thought
inb4 site crashes due to overload anyway
in that case I will scurry to the other stream site <,<
or trololols raiding the site
and then it comes back right at the end of th eepisode
so it spoils
xD
twilight_sprinkle: That's part of the fun, isn't it?

The chat will just create a wormhole because of non stop spamming and we all will perish. Like the maya guys already figured out.
Oh geez, Parappa had a cartoon series? XD
2012... its true
2012, because of ponies
Areus: Isn't that the 21st of may or december though?
The wormhole need some time to grow.
Yes/
He's getting a tv show on CN in 2013.
Who is?
Parappa?
Yup.
Parappa the Rapper
It was a video game on PS1
very good video game*
I don't want to watch this show.
I mean episode.
So excuse me while i'll try to beat the bathroom rap.
they need to bring back the old Spyro and give him his own telly show xD
Ooo Spyro
that adorable dragon
WRECK IT RALPH
Howdy y'all!
Hai Everlasting_Joy :)
is the stream still down?
the new one.. is.. well.. meh..... not bad.. but its just not Spyro.. as I knew him
Hiyo Everlasting_Joy
MisterBull82: The version that had an actualy story or the original?
soo, what about video?
Pinkielover123: no no no, it's "Wreck-it Wrek".
Howdy MLP_Brovakiin and Gold_Demona!
MisterBull82, I know exactly what you mean.
:D
No no no.
Ralph.
/me hugs Gold_Demona
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=408vPQe69GM&feature=related
MisterBull82, Legend of Spyro had a lot of things that were better than the original Spyro, but all in all, the original Spyro had better games.
Spyro.
Spike.
MisterBull82, I think the newer Spyro would've faired better as a series of movies than a game series.
I remember way too little of the original games
Spikero.
Pinkielover123: Wrek.
@gold agreed
I've seen art of spike meeting spyro.
SonDash is just...
what
but ah well.. things change.. evolve. they either get better or get worst
MisterBull82, The gameplay was kinda meh (except for the third game cuz infitie flying FTW)
Guys.
infitie~
SonDash.
MisterBull82, The games themselves were WAY too short
aye
Skylanders.
MisterBull82, BUT, the story was pretty kickass.
I love that game.
indeed :)
hi guys
never did see skylanders, wasn't it an mmo or somesuch?
Skylanders does not count as a Spyro game. It's an awesome action-figure game that happens to have Spyro's image tacked onto it to make it sell better.
hi pony_painter_360
no, it was a single player game with a toy gimmik
I happen to like the toy gimmick. ._.
I didn't say it was a spyro game.
hey bladed wings
oh, its cool, dont get me wrong
:3
That's the best idea ever.
but a gimmick is a gimmick, ya know?
Putting toys on a thingy and they appear in the game.
Yeah.
I would've been ALL over that as a kid.
I'd have ALL the figures
Pinkielover123: How does this improve the game?
candy candy candy
well... we had The power glove.. and Rob to keep us busy ^^;;;
I said that's the best idea.
pinkielover123 hi
Seem to me like its just a cheap ploy to sell tons of useless crap
Hi.
hi
:D
Funny, I had a nintendo as a kid, but never knew about the powerglove or rob until recently.
I predict that the pony craze could evolve into a sort of Pokemon knockoff with videogame toy gimmick
Hah skylanders sounds like a pokemon kind of game
Jammer Lammy reminds me of fluttershy,maybe it's because she is shy.
We need a shrug emote.
i will attack you with squees
:)
FLUTTERSHY GOOOO!!!!
!
Gold_Demona, I had a friend who had both of those, but I am an old, yet looking young kinda mare :D

Hi, Good Morning everyone
Hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress~
*everypony
hallo
Het TheGreatAndPowerfulT!
I am incredibly hyped for season 3
good morning TheGreatAndPowerfulT
so... who wants to bet $5 that there'll be some kinda hybrid of the sea pony in this season?
hello everpony what u think season 3 will be like
Well, there can't really be any spoilers :/
My.
Pony.
caus we waited neck end of a year for it
^
all i say is
...
Ha i found it
sea ponies do u think?
Micheal Bay will pick up the license for the movie.. and it will simply be called "Pony." the period included
:)
SHOO BE DOO
MisterBull82: and instead of lasers unicorns will shoot explosions
there will be asplosions, and pointless car chases an more asplosios and random sexy human chick and asplosions
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4357/ I don't know who she is,but she looks sexy.
xD
Don't you know Zone tan?
Ahem.
MisterBull82, sexy mare washing her motorcycle?
eeyep
And then the motorcycle gets chased and asplodes
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3332/
Indeed Gold_Demona
but then Uwe Bolle will take up the license for the sequel
and have badly done zombies invade a toy miniature set of Equestria
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1684/
MisterBull82, So suddenly it's a japanese sentai? O_o
that year, Hasbro will go bankrupt, and everybody would had moved on to the newer more improved Barney the Epic TRex series
lol
What?
lol
There will be people in pony costumes fighting across a tokyo cardboard model. Just like the old godzilla movies.
I can tell a vison.
Uwe Bolle will claim to have been inspired by the artistic style of the older japanese monster films. and it would be a bold faced lie... like always
Season 3 will be awesome!~

theres no stream like a bronystate stream
haha true true
except there isn't one atm.... :(
I'll never forget.... the day Derpy was named... and talked
My stream isnt loading
Ha! chat blew up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBULa6RUa-c&feature=plcp
After the ad goes away I just have a perpetual circle
Yup.
The day when derpy talked.
I was there. it was an epic day
Was the day when my life was complete.
but then... some troll ruined it for us all
but what if....she talks again Pinkielover?? What then?
oh god.. I remember the chaos! it was so terrible! *cringes*
I don't remember the chaos- but I remember her talking
She sounded VERY boyish
ohai
yo
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBULa6RUa-c&feature=plcp
hello Jim
jbh1145 You should stop spamming that link
If she talks again.
the chaos came shortly after the heavenly event... they edited it all out because of some trolls complaining
BOOM HEADSHOY
well yeah I remember complaints from some people
Anything showing?
*Headshot
holy doly holy doly holy
EQD timer had ran out!
Can i kill some trolls?
ok
but didn't they just revoice her has female and edit the dialog a bit?
ill stop
Just this second!
AHAHAHAA
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Top 10 Pony Videos of October
they did.. and they also removed her name
MisterBull82 I think you got a wrong impression of what trolls are. Trolling itself is a art form you don't do it to upset people or insult them. But to make some situations awkward and funny. Insulting and ruining shit for others is not trolling FYI
pity about the removal of name- but I think revoicing her as female was good
derpy talking was beast
Theres a difference between being funny and humorous and a douchebag
killer: lol, I know what a troll is. I'm just trying to make this sound all ... dramatic-ish xD
trolling is often sadistic though
so no I don't think that's right
Whenever we talk about derpy talking,we get into fights.
its sad, really
/me has no strong feelings in one direction
I like derpy, but I've never heard her new voice
MisterBull82 Eh you may end up giving people a wrong impression and uninformed on the matter
I'm straight up pro Derpy
ahhh its got the Two Best Sisters in it...LOVE IT
6899 is getting annoying...
but I thouht she was too male sounding in the original
whoever linked that friendship equal magic....thx :D
I never gave her a voice before she talked so anything fit for me
technically same here
@killerpony: noted. :P sorry bout that. I'll blame it on the fact I've been up since 11 last night xP
Ello there everybrony.
Hello Mala
Hiyo Malavolent

Arf
pokemon is better than final fantasy 13
WhA
I am proud to say I knew about BronyState before Equestria Daily!
no final fantasy 14
Hello AJIsAwesome! :3
no 13-2
No, final fantasy 82
I feel sad for all those who never heard of Bronystate pre-EQD
Hi, MadSurge! :)
I heard about Bronystate from Ballad Of The Brony. :)
hi there
Final Fantasy 8 (the 8 is turned on its side)
/me huggles MadSurge
Zamer why? I heard of this site because of EqD
Hai MadSurge :)
AJIsAwesome: Same here :P

AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a5ca5bdbb7687e1eb60f011225b73fc9.png <3
Guyz/
Ponies.

What about 'em Pinkielover123?
I kinda miss Shy and Vivi though
like S3 for a small fee of $9,999,999.99
Tommrow.
a month
Oh mai D:
jbh: lolololol
Deacon: wasn't Vivi in here a while ago, I recognise the name...
tommorow... it all happens...
Deacon: Vivi still having computer problems?
I don't think I can afford that. :<
lauren faust on staurday 9:59 am tommorow: oh sorry we delayed it to december 2070
Hmm... know what, I'm gonna get me something to snack on
In the meantime...
GEAR UP
jbh1145: :D
one billion dollars... *puts pinkie to corner of mouth*
Tomorrow, PONIES WILL RISE
Socks VioletVanilla yes
MadSurge: I love it. :)
AJIsAwesome no idea
they migrated to my iPhone PonySwagg
Is there even a video playing?
Lauren Faust Contiuned: NOW LITTLEST PET SHOP ALL DAY CAUSE ITS BETTER THAN MLP CRAP!!!!!!!11111
Gha! too many peoplez in chat, makes me feel weird!
LOVE IS IN BLOOM! A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE, A HANDSOME GROOM 2 HEARTS, BECOMING ONE!
eeeehnope
etc etc
A BOND THAT CANNOT BE UNDONE!
pony_6253: nope
/me hides in corner and sucks thumb
Socks wait until tomorrow
^
MY LITTLE PONY
I USED TO WONDER WHAT FRIENDSHIP COULD BE
so.. who else is going to paint their walls pink and purple, add sparkles and hearts and doodles of poni poni poni poni and play pony songs just loud enough to irritate their neighbors?
You have no idea, Socks
what do yyou think of littiest pet shop?
Deacon: I know, we will not be able to see the chat
Use ALL the caps lock! :D
Tomorrow, it's gonna be brutal
ALL THE CAPS!
:P
It's good.
Pfft, It's gonna be brutal TONIGHT
well I assume we shall all become "Shoppers" tomorrow
SO many people will be on just ahead of the show XD
yea, tonight as well
tommorow, the entire internet will crash.
are male fans gonna be called pet shopies?
Bah, I'll turn the stream of once ponies are done.
jbh: pups would be fitting, actually
There should be a seperate chat for the people who just like hanging on BronyState... like me ¬_¬
MadSurge: http://derpy.me/qxLea :)
as for male carebear fans? just bears
Guys, opinions on the best song in MLP? Theres just something about love is in bloom :C
Socks there is, but it's a secret to everybody
idk
Deacon: :O
best song idk
Love Is In Bloom makes you like a style of music that you normally wouldn't like
just look at the channel-list
AJIsAwesome: party alligator! :3
Deacon: I'm not everybody, I like secrets!
I won't be on the chat during the episodes, probably
Sssssssshhhhhhhhh. damnit. I like it quiet there.
/me talks like a 3year old
Secrets? ooooh spill
Okay, I'm gonna leave for a bit, BRB
<3
whoever posts last in this chat has to print out a whole buncha pony propaganda images and cram them in their neighbors mailbox...
as long as it's not a royal secret
I have to work tomorrow, and I get off like an hour after the premeire
Ninjazz: :D wait until tomorrow
this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mib66D-UH_w
MisterBull82: Deal. I don't like my neighbor anyway.
what if said neighbors don't have mailboxes
MadSurge, the madness. I had forgetten all about it these past months.
People exist without mailboxes?
MisterBull82: Wait, when is 'last'?
Ninjazz: Ikr
Zamer: then you eliver the material..... personally
21 Hours remaining...
Vivix yea, they live under rocks
crazy hermits
Ninjazz: but the best people remained all year :)
dawn of the last day 24 hours remaning
The chat moves so fast! It's making me tense, I'm beginning to hyperventilate!
like I said, wait until tomorrow
Socks: Oh, this is slow compared to tomorrow.
Socks, wait until the episode...
/me dies due to being an introvert
damn i wish the GL sale would restart, i want to buy Vynial
@socks: aparently you've never been in here during a pony livestream xD
MadSurge, familier faces keep disappearing though.
i'm so lost
or atleast rairty with $2
really socks
21 Hours, 17 minutes Remaining...
I know, I may not talk during the episode just watch :(
Talk to people later
Ninjazz: they come back :D
That's what I do
lol we need a 24 style countdown :D
oh yea, store I work at sell mlp coloring books. I wanted to look at them, but they're in the front of the store
that's what I do
noone listens during the stream anyway, it's just a crazy explosion of joy
It was ludicrous at the Derpy episode, it'll be absolutely bonkers during the first S3 streaming.
i'VE learned to watch and commentate at the same time
MadSurge, hopefully.
Vivix: XD
though I cant help but watch the chat sometimes just to read the funny comments about the episode
i was afraid it would break the stream that day
EVEN i wrote some sentences to avoid missing the good scenes
tomarro is double episode, right?
luckily i was also recording it on the hub
Ninjazz: I'm not going anywhere :)
ON WORD
THE CUTEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b4goHbf0lU&feature=g-high-rec
I usually hide in regulars.
Invi: yes. A TWO-PARTER
I fully expect the stream to break as the majority of europe shall be here.
jbh1145 also the most funniest :D
MadSurge, at least some don't.
@socks: bloody brits! ruining our pony tiem!
I'm watching from England!
What if the first episode secretly fixes everything, and episode 2 was a flashback
:P
I'm glad I do that, MisterBull82.
:>
or episode 1
Chav.
of*
Pls go.
U suk
MisterBull82: Don't tell that to a Brit, though. They don't like being associated with Europe.
Ninjazz: Did you see the picture I posted a while back? :)
What can I say, us brits love our poniz!
Says the Aussie chav...
Fffffffff.
Go stab a can of Fosters.
AJIsAwesome, unfortunately I did not.
I will.
kammer: lol, noted xD
/me pokes Jmo, "where are these new people you speak of?"
I lied.

Hi, alexxm. :)

AJIsAwesome, aaahhh. Now that the wave of lag is gone I can see your picture now.
Is the lack of stream supposed to get me even more pumped for tommorow? Because i doubt that's possible
how are things Deacon and AJIsAwesome
alexxm: Good. How about you? :)
And unfortunately Surge already sent me that one. ^_^
alexxm excellent, though gonna miss the episode tomorrow

Ninjazz: Okay. :D

Welcome back alexxm!
AJIsAwesome: not me, it's gonna be 4 PM tomorrow :D
jbh1145 it's only until tomorrow, and you've waited until 200 days from season 2 finale
MadSurge: Wow....
AJIsAwesome: Ikr
9 AM for me. I used to wake up earlier, but college. :D
i wasnt even a brony at the time of the canterlot wedding episode
AJIsAwesome: it's better than before though, it was 7 PM for me
MadSurge: Ouch.
i was a brony before season 2
alexxm: Lucky. :D
jbh1145 oh, well welcome anyways
alexxm: youtube poops made me a brony :D
alexxm Me TOO
alexxm same with me
AJIsAwesome alough that was barely as i started watching in august
I became a brony around the time MMMystery on The Friendship Express. :)
I became a brony right in the middle of season 1
I guess I started watching the show somewhere around the end of S1. I don't know, I didn't get into the fandom before well into the wait between series.
i'll try to sleep earlier after BMN is over
Hello AJIsAwesome
HI Cypresswolf. :)
I became a brony right at the end of season 1
same here 6253
I was a hater after S1's finale.
gotta love your first episode being the finale
obligatory hourly art spam: http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/135234062987.png seeking opinions to help further the piece :P
I considered becoming one after watching A Dog and Pony Show, but I didn't accept the label until Friendship Express aired.
spoils you throughout the ticket master episode
i remember i watched MLP FIM with the S2 premiere, a classmate from high school, told me to watch it......i LOVED how they used the Star Wars finale
have no clue what this video is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZkZb589HrI
I suppose I was never really a hater. It was so much easier to just scroll past content when I saw it.
I sorta came around the time cutie pox was shown
That's what I get for being lazy.
The first episode I saw was Mare in the moon
BUT i became a brony after watching ''Lesson ZERO'' and ''May the best pet win''
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO)
Gah, chat crashed. :D

Kammerjunk: i didn't cared that much either, but i couldn't understand HOW this show has a cult following.......i do now
Reluctant to state why i was a hater in the first place after stating it so many times.
I knew I was a brony after "Winter Wrap Up"
75000 seconds
Dark92Enigma: Pretty much, yeah.
Ninjazz: Fair 'nuff.

jbh1145: Ha ha, their mouths don't even moev.
move*
and i've heard of Bronystate on YouTube, and SO MANY TIMES i tried to get in......until late february
its not funny its lazyness
Kammerjunk, well, it's just that it tends to swing chat's topic into a rather unpleasant tone. :/
For most at least.
jbh1145: don't you mean vice-versa?
hey Dark92Enigma have you seen this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6cxNR02VLI
jbh1145: I think it's a bit of both.
Well, I think Imma letch'all go for the day. See ya when I see ya Bronystate.

Ninjazz: 'S all good.
Vale, Gold_Demona.
ITS NOT LIKE I CAN MAKE A NEW ONE!!!!!!!!!!!
Dark92Enigma i think the guy who sings in that song should voice german discord
which is worse, over two rainbows, or so many ways to play?
jbh1145: oh, you're talking about Over Two Rainbows
jbh1145: the former, only by comparison
jbh1145: they're both horrible
give so many ways to play, at least they made there lips move in that
they both suck
PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY
are we talking about the wretched gen 3.5 infant versions of MLP?
And then I realised Sweetie Belle is an orphan whose only biological parent is a double rainbow.
I think it was 3.6, right?
AJIsAwesome: yes......
3.5 was the chibi kid ponies?
Not officially, but yes.
3.56
Ah.
Thanks, Kammerjunk. :)
dont you guys mean non canon
AND IT'S DRIVING ME NONSENSE, LIKE THE ''FELIX' THE CAT'' MOVIE"!
Bitte.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGlaR_BtS90&feature=related
I did enjoy the "Bronies Watch" take on that show
lol i remember Felix the cat :D
plenty of laughs
MisterBull82: What was that one?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Awesome Chrysalis Cosplay
huh, indeed a good cosplay
Awesome and cosplay are a rare combination of words.
AJI: cant recall off the top of my head atm
Ninjazz you're not looking in the right directions then
jbh1145: The length of the video. Look at it.
AJI: but I think they did a couple of episodes.. including the double rainbow birth one
How fitting.
its so funny how to newborn cuties walk
Deacon, you're probably right.
OH GOD G3 SCTALOOO RUNNNNNNNN
Then again, i don't look too hard.
Sketch_Toku_Brony: The original show, the ''Twisted Tales'' or......*sigh* the movie?
I think have a folder for great cosplays.
PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY PARTY
jbh: I know.. right? dont equine newborns start walking right away on all their legs?
hehe, first time watching newborn cuties?
Can't be arsed to find it.
Oh mai that /is/ great cosplay.

ooh, have you watched World's Biggest Tea Party?
/me thinks of better things to do when he's bored
Deacon: .... *pukes*
XD
the only thing worse than newbon cuities is this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXPZ9vE8HOk&feature=related
Deacon: NO!!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!!!
/me MUST.....NOT....CLICK
Come one guys, you all must be desensitized to the point where it doesn't feel like buring anymore.
CLICK IT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TOO
Ninjazz: I actually feel that way. :D
Ninjazz not the new people
FREAKING CLICK IT
They have much to learn by the hands of a certain streamer.
jbh1145: OH, it's baby looney tunes.
NO SOUND?
it has sound
Welp, watched Over Two Rainbows. On to So Many Different Ways to Play.
I didn't mind Baby Looney Tunes. :S
is your volume off?
AJIsAwesome: me neither....
i guess its not that bad but its pretty meh
And this is coming from a person who was an avid fan of Looney Tunes and Tiny Toons.
jbh1145: nope, the volume is at all-time high
espically when you compare it to tiny toons
AJIsAwesome: Oh Yeah!
AJIsAwesome: /)
Dark92Enigma: (\ :)
DONT FREAKING BREAK YOUR TOYS
Sup suckas?

I hate hgtv
MisterBull82: Oh, you bet! I went through a hallway with, like 6 Fluttershys, and 4 chinaland knockoffs.....i saw a lady picking the knockoff
Praise to the Nobsi
HGTV?

GMT+2 hre

Funnily enough, it's 4am over here in Nowhere, Pacific Ocean.
okay, y'all.. let's play a game to pass the time... I spy with my own eye something..... black
Seing how we have 142 people in here, I wonder how many people will be here for BMN.
I spy something white...The text!
MisterBull82: The screen?
AJIsAwesome: 1,000,000
BMN starts at around 9am, so i won't be.
Rainboom got it
Well, I watched both Newborn Cuties and Baby Looney Tunes.
Should the stream be working?
I spy with my little eye... something orange
Because it doesn't :P
And I'm alive. Ain't that a kick in the head.
No, it's a hole in the boat.
My head keeps spinnin'.
I keep a constantly grinnin'.
the orange thing I saw was the I on the top right corner of the stream screen (and the .tv)
If this is just the beginnin', my life is gonna be beautiful.
Great, now I want to play Fallout again.
^ :>
damnit Kammerjunk me too
Damn you PS3 and you're brokeness.
this remix is cool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxFUCmUd1Ao
your*
@rainboom ... I only have the chat window detatched from the website.. so is this orange object on the site itself? or is it located within the chat window?
Work, brain.
I can't brain today.
I have the dumbs.
dang dumb disease
you has the stupid! lololol
Seems like my dumbs can't brain as much as it used to be abble to could do.
RECENT POSTS TEXT :)

Mostly sadness.

?
jm2i, I'm glad it does someone good.
come on equerstria daily, give us another season 3 preview
Wrek then I must eat sick puppies for breakfast the3n
Wrek, Murkia has a LOT of those things running around.
jbh: why, dude?.. spoilers suck
Why? The premiere's tomorrow. :D
please
yes!
jbh1145, isn't Tara Strong answering S3 questions on the hub twitter atm?
That would be nice, if only I weren't avoiding Season 3 spoilers like the plague. :P
^
please please please
i like spoliers
I've only been spoiled once.. and that was the crystal pony song posted up some time after season 2's ending
yup, it's been a long 200 days, and I've seen around 2 pics, but that'sa about it
05AHEm
I hate spoilers
05no S3 talk in here
^
I am very proud about the fact that I've managed to avoid stuff like the Smile Smile Smile song for myself. And let me tell you, hearing it for the first time in the actual episode, without any prior knowledge is an AMAZING feel.
@wrek that's the first I've heard of this rule the whole time I've been in here o.0
best vid ever: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLCOc3lo6E&feature=watch-vrec
Point being, let's not spoil S3 stuff for people, okay.
^
MisterBull82: then you didn't read the rules?
MisterBull82 it's been like that since season 3 was announced here
05MisterBull82: no S3 spoilers in here.
05wetehr it is song at certain episodes
im kidding its horrible
05names
05etc
MisterBull82, look in the topic
lol, well I've only been here once since the end of season 2... ^^; I'm no regular by any means
MisterBull82: Do you see the red highlighted text? :)
anyways, how about that nutella?
05heck id ratehr not even know what the hell crystal ponies are about
I've never had Nutella.
05but the episode name spoiled that for me
I can't tell you just how much I love Nutella.
MisterBull82 (protipp: look at the heading above the chat)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLCOc3lo6E&feature=watch-vrec
The only thing I want to hear in S3 is Shining Armor go TWILY again. Just one more time.
I see it
thanks
Ninjazz: :D
sporilers: he does
I mean, I once bought this 1 kilo nutella jar for 12 dollars and just ate that brown deliciousness with a spoon.
Not all at once, but you know.
05that include joke spoilers aswell jbh1145
reminds me, I still need to try some
whoops
now I want nutella :\
^
Spoilers: things that go on the back of cars to make them look like race cars
EqD is a terrible place not to get spoileered at
Curse you Kammer.
CHOCOLATE?
I mean, darnit Seth.. stoppit!
CHOCALTE!!!!!!!
Ninjazz: You're welcome.
spoilers: S3 will contain ponies
DID YOU SAY CHOOCOLAAAATE?
>:C
Nope.
CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!!!
CHOCOLATE!!!!!
MisterBull82: I don't even visit EQD in the time leading up to a new series.
none for me thanks, I had my Halloween binge
MisterBull82 true, MLB is even worse
he said chocobo xD
CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!!
CHCOLATE!!!!!!!!
MLB is much worse than EQD in terms of spoilers. :D
05jbh1145: no spamming
spoiler: Rairty will be in season 3
oh
OH HERE IT COMES.
MLb is really bad for spoilers
GOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAL.
?
Spoiler: Season 3 will come.
I dont visit EqD.. my RS Blog feed notifyer thingie tells me everything that goes on there :P
scared yet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLCOc3lo6E&feature=watch-vrec
Stillsick_icybeauti: hi! You can be sick together with Wrek :D
He said no joke spoilers too, bro.
MadSurge: Lulz
^^
does anybody know of Silent Ponyville?
He did???
Yup.
No spoilers of any kind. :)
Wrek Worst yet once the episode part 1 and 2 airs the manechat while chaotic people will probably post a metric ton of spoilers
killerpony7733: There's always +m
05i "obviously" cant possible destinguish a joke spoiler from a real spoiler, so better kick for both <3
AJIsAwesome Surely no doubt. But again with alot more people and all and the manechat exploding i think theres gonna be a good deal that says ''oh i have seen that and i know what this is about hurr durr''
killerpony: also a bad habbit over on Ponychan... they try to keep the spoilers from cropping up, but every now and then someone would let it slip past the censory system
killerpony7733: Ah.
05mane chat will be muted durign episode airing
Thank god
05so chat will be in side rooms
05easier to manage
05easier to ban
Everyone will go in their favorite pony chat :3
okie dokie
Well, atleast everyone's not discussing spoilers and being a downer about it at the same time like /mlp/.
Nope, I'm in all of them.
Does Trollestia record all the side room chats?
#Rarity, gentelmen, I hope to see you there.
Please. Everybody knows #Twilight_Sparkle have the best conversations.
Is there a video going on right now? I dont see anything
#Twilight_Sparkle is a downgrade #Rainbow_Dash.
I usually don't stick to one channel.
I remember a discussion in the Twilight room about an object of infinite size existing inside another object of infinite size.
*Schultz Voice* "I see nothing!"
I'll be on the rarity channel tomorrow...
That was a while ago, though.
i'm not sure what channel I'm going to. :D
Ninjazz: The Round Stable is much quicker to spot slip ups on the spoilers, and all first posts must be mod approved :$
Infinite isn't a real thing. It's an abstraction.
AJIsAwesome: All of them! :3
Meh i'll probably just sit in quiet mane and some other non BS related channel probably
You can't have an object of infinite size
Ninjazz, but Twily is awesome
MadSurge, that sounds incredibly facist.
Invi, TWILY.
Uncle: Oh, of course, but it was fun all the same. That is, when only few people are there, of course.
Aw, come on TWILY.
Ninjazz: not at all
ja, i always say twily ^^
OH I missed you, kid.
:D
I kinda miss when Bronystate used livestream.. to me, their chat system is the least laggy (at least on the main livestream page it is) I've had problems with the stream and the chat sucking up my system memory on this laptop for some horrible reason
Hello to all again.
im watching the mlp fim live show thing, its scary
Hi, VenHur. :)
jbh1145: Look at their hind legs. LOOK AT THEM.
MadSurge, the point where it has to be "mod approved" kinda scares me though.
Ninjazz: that means there's a spoilers thread and noone is allowed to post those in anyother thread
I KNOW
MadSurge, only spoiler's thread?
MisterBull82 the livestream's only for episode days, but looks like it's gonna be used tomorrow
@deacon: ah, cool
hi VenHur
where is pinkie, rarity, and fluttershy?
Ninjazz: the first posts of every new user. After that they're not
So, is there is not a single live stream recording as of now?
MadSurge, that's... an odd way of moderation but okay.
Ninjazz: it's just so that no troll waltzes in and posts shit/spoilers/whatever
so many ponies here :D
VenHur: whats your timezone, bro?
Invi mmhmm
/me starts sandbagging his corner
It's the Mexican time zone.
applejack dosent sound southern she sounds european
Ninjazz: And yes, there's a spoiler thread. Just avoid that and you'll know nothing about the new episodes :D
11,02so many ponehs o3o
Ohai, SB. :D
so many NewSuperBronyU :D
11,02Ohai :D

meh, I get all my Nintendo news and needs from the 3DSBlog... mostly 3DS related news
11,02I get my Nintendo news from Bronysith
NewSuperBronyU: ur welcome
11,02:3
Oh Nintendo...I can remember as far back into 2002, the time when playing Melee and Luigi's Mansion opened the key to an new world, a world seperated from the logic and matters...
:D
meep
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP/Littlest Petshop Combo Promo
Ah, Melee. I had so much fun playing that game.
And posiblities.
11,02I meant to go with BronyState but i liked that outcome better :3
They're REALLY pushing that show on the fandom.
good ol' Luigi's Mansion.. loved the atmosphere, but the game gradually got boring.. and I could never for some reason beat the last bos
The SFX matched so well with the gameplay. :D
/me noms on Bronysith
Can't wait for everything...COME SATURDAY COME!
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
11,02O.O
nintendo nostalgia monemts?
/me hugs Bronysith back :D
Yep, Snow. :)
that would be mario kart double dash for me...
best mario kart ever
MY CABBAGES!

I... grew up with the NES ^^
Snow: Oh, I LOVE that game. :O
here is that all new promo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gvq2alO4oxc
MisterBull82: Same. :)
11,02Mah favorite nintendo moment is when Mario grabs the final Power Star from Bowser in Super Mario 64 :3
Oh...they're had a new Littlest Pet Shop show...not that I cared for it.
The BOULDER cares not for your silly cabbages!
So what's going on?

FoxTheHuman: NewSuperBronyU is pregnant

Fox: pure madness! thAT'S what's going on! xD
11,02I pregnant? o.O
NewSuperBronyU: Is it a boy or a girl?
looks way better than new super mario 2
are you a girl?
AJIsAwsome: it was the only mario kart were actually teamwork was involved :P
11,02It's a Wii U ;3;
yup, you have the new Wii U on the3 way
11,02Coming in 9 days
Some of my favorite moments had to be when Link stabs the sword in Ganon's head...
Snow: Co-op was fantastic. We were either the Koopa Bros. or the Mario Bros. :D
The ending of Pikmin 2...
11,02VenHur: That was cool too
11,02:3
AJIsAwsome: i was baby mario, ALWAYS
Deacon: I'd envy you.. but for some reason, I'm feeling patient.. I'll get mine sometimes early next year :P
PEWDIEPAAAAAAAhh

Snow: Gah, that Chain CHomp special. :D
Wrek: BMID?

05and hai NewSuperBronyU <3
lali-ho BlazeAngel
Hi, BlazeAngel. :)
11,02^-^
AJIsAwsome: nah, was easy to dodge
Wrek: Hmm, never heard of it.
Dat + is gone again. ;.;
Who ate it this time?
Snow: But I thought it homes in on you.
Deacon: I did get the 3DS on launch day however.. not sure what it is about getting a console on day one... but its like a crowning achievement or something :P
05its bronystates Planetside 2 outfit
OH.
11,02cookehs o3o
AJIsAwsome: what i hated the most was that MFING blue shell
NewSuperBronyU, did you eat my + again? ;.;
Snow: Gah, the blue shell. The worst blue shell for me was 64.
So, I heard of this fanfiction called The Spidereses...joy...
11,02;-; yesh
Wrek Well while theres not much use for it i got a extra beta code again
NewSuperBronyU, :I
MisterBull82 neat
AJIsAwsome: it did, but exploded after a while before it could hit you if you wher far away
@snow: I know, right? worst SMK weapon evar
Bad NewSuperBronyU! *Hits with newspaper*
11,02AJIsAwesome: :I
blue shell is awesome when you hit someone with it but it sucks when your the guinea pig
Many said it had a good plot...I don't know what's the point of it.
11,02BlazeAngel: ;A;
NewSuperBronyU: Don't eat people's + :3
11,02okies :3
You seem to have burped it up NewSuperBronyU. You live... for now...
:P
What happened to SB64
11,02D:
i make + disapear like a magic trick
there's no escaping the blue shell.. that's what I hate most about it
who wants the wii u mario kart to be double dash 2?
ohh
11,02LucidDream: I here :D
:D
you got a screen on the controller :D
thats right, even when you ended up 4th you still got hit by it.
MisterBull82, actually, there is. just fall down a cliff ^^
/me drops the controller, screen breaks
DAMNIT
I don't think a Double Dash 2 would be existaint, but I do had an better idea.
Invi: well that's just..... cant think of a word
11,02I want the Wii U Mario Kart to have REAL Mode 7 scaling and DK Jr as a character again.
no, no double dash 2
MisterBull82, mariotastic ^^
only a remake
for gamecube
DK Jr.. ohh man
Gah, I REALLY want a DD 2. :D
Add the option to allows one or two racers driving in the same kart.
NewSuperBronyU but we have full 3D now
Was he in any other version then the SNES mario cart?
VenHur: dude, that was in double dash
SB, ask scoots if he wants another bag of ice- I mean sugar. K?
LucidDream, i guess he was in double dash too
Oh you know, the past few weeks of the non stop advertising along with pony merch, similar protagonist design, same show design infact.
oh god

HUH.
I expect it to be better tommorow
Kammerjunk, and thank goodness someone got that ref.
yes.. yes.. by tomarrow, these hills will be swarming with slobering frenzied 30 year old neckbeards, cooldudes, potential trolls, spammers, and a tiny percentage of actual girls... are y'all ready for that? xD

Tomorrow, it will cost 400,000 dollars to not get spammed... for 3 secods. :P
apparently twitter is down right now

Nobsi nope, nothing atm

Nobsi, there isnt anything.
I think it was Brony Tv
deacon ok thanks
Ninjazz: I'll talk about your secret club as much as I darn please!
You're going to give away our secret hide out. >_<
:D
Kammerjunk, Hmmmmm? <_<
INB4 joins.
You're being counter productive.
KammerJunK: you mean fight club?
Ninjazz not really a secret unless they look at the channel list
Snow: You said the words. :O
Snow what was the first rule
It was a different stream, yay Equestria Daily's list
Snow: No, but don't talk about that one either.
Deacon, "secret" enough.
ninjazz? secret? what, this place? dude.. we're the Minis Turrith (spelling?) of brony streamdom
I stand corrected.
Hey guys, can I have some technical support with a mouse? :3
NO ONE BETTER.
we could tell you, but we have to kill you MisterBull82
*puts on glasses* whats the problem?
I SWEAR TO SEVERAL CELESTIAL BEINGS KAMMER.
MisterBull82: Minas Tirith?
BlazeAngel give it some cheese
^
kammer: yar
Zamer, thx.
BlazeAngel: Depends on what kind of problem.
Snow, Its wireless, and wont do anything.
MisterBull82, where was Minas Tirith during S1?
dang it
Heeeyyy :D I'm back
Batteries dead most likely
MilkyWhiskers, wassabe going on?
unless people check the channel list or someone post the channel link in the main
have you tried replacing them?
Ninjazz: good question
Well there's your problem, BlazeAngel
You're using a wireless
:/
Hey, wireless is the future.
Not for mouses.
BlazeAngel: Just got some chips and soda, and i am ready for this f-f-frrrida-ay night
Or keyboards
No, really.
have you ever noticed how the big stone wall in minas tirith looks like a giant nose snorting a coke line?
Hey everypony hows it going
dang it i accitdentaly clicked off chrome
MilkyWhiskers, settle in. 5 hours. Trololol...
I'll always stick with wired.
BlazeAngel: check the batteries, or check if the reciever in the pc is connected
lali-ho Zombert
Dark_Horst: wat
I'm just saying that I'd like to keep this room as entertaining as possible.
BlazeAngel: Yeah, XD
Kammerjunk: come on, it's obvious
Hi, Zombert. :)
DashWithRainbows, you know, it is possible to transfer electricity wireless (but that technic needs to improve)
Dark_Horst: OH MY GOD IT DOES.
It has been a long week I cant tell you that much
Dark_Horst, yes.
or get some Zombie Powered Turbines going
Dark_Horst: Consarnit, cannot unsee.
now we probably know why all the "stone" in there is white
the whole city is a giant stash!
0_0 what did I walk into
Helm's Deep got's nothing on Minas Tirath.
ponies
Zombert: BronyState 5 hours before we have any reason to be here.
Lul
Didn't even realise the chavo talked.
Haha true I havn't been on all week
im just watching chat now and then, busy playing the app
or all of last week
BRB I gotta make a sacrifice to Chuck Norris
soooooo is anyone gonna watch littiest pet sshop?
Is it just me, or are all lawyer commercials funny?
its you.
Kammerjunk, hilarious.
They're probably the only funny part of a lawyer, so at least they have that.
Ninjazz: up til the arrival of the one true king, Minis Tirrith was just a shallow shell of itself... the Steward of Gondor was a weak fragile old man, corrupted by the seeing stone that he possessed, and he saw no hope... so as he weakened, so did the moral of the armies that protected that city... it was the Horsemen who came and saved them in the end, was it not?
dat wall of text
lol
MisterBull82, no, dude. In all seriousness, it was ALL Gandalf.
QUICK, EVERYONE PILE INTO THE TARDIS!
Jk.

Solidness, because
Solidness: I know cant wait
i hate my photographic memorie so much.

Anyone else play Hidden: Source?
Snow, withou looking, what are the google title colors on google .com from left to right?
BRYBGR
Yay I remembered Friday Movie night :P
that i dont know
Invi do I win?
but i remember pictures
REFRESHING PAGE
and episodes
Kung FU Hustle was hilarious. :D
*Fu
Oh the randomness of Bronystate.
Never ceases to amuse thou.
4 hours
why must it be 4 HOURS
Brad[Laptop] no, but you earn a.. uuuh.... hug :D
I'm only gonna be here for the first hour of movies :(
Invi yay.
parents thought it was funny to turn safesearch off
/me huggies Snow
btw that really was from memory...
Snow: Ouch.
/me hugs Snow :(
/me hugies Brad[Laptop] too ^^
i searched pony, bad idea.
I'm a cool kid, I roll without safesearch off.
I have never joined a pony stream before! Sorta kinda.
Snow: I know that feeling.
on*
How2engrish
Welcome to the stream herd
guys my craving for pony cant wait another day
help
>_>
I usually watch from Youtube, wat do tomorrow?
come here yugo
Oh, so then Yugo is new, isn't he?
Think so. :)
Yugo watch with us!
my mind is ruined because of that.
/me fills Bronystate with a non-lethal gas wich gives a pony Double Rainbow sydrome.
so many new ponies...
Wait what did Snow see?
ponies
Oh
OH
with safe search off
ROFL.
Jmo: Isn't it obvious?
Invi, yeah, all the buggers you and I know are gone.
whats going on in here
I'm not a new pony, I just never bothered with the streams before because of how full they are and how they seem to break down, for me at least
spraying r34 in TF2 is great
BlazeAngel, not really...
I hope they work this time around...
.....
ITS NOT
Do you think we'll crash the streaming service tomorrow?
donutpop365: I hope not. :D
Am I supposed to be seeing something on the left right now?
/me hugs Snow
There there.
BlazeAngel, most of them are still here
people like me never foget it!
Invi, are they still lurking in DashieSauce?
uh no Yugo
It'll all be fine.
forget*
AJIsAwesome: Ohhai *noms*. Me too...
just spinning
donutpop365 doubt it, but the chat network might
wait 4 hours, they are streaming how to train your dragon and the jetsones movie.
BlazeAngel, uh, that too
/me is nommed :D
Phew, good. Yeah just spinny.
Deacon: Makes sense.
and then a 10 episode pony marathon
Bookmarking bronystate, just in case, then.
MadSurge: Heyo.
discord returning?
Guys how full is this chat gonna be when Season 3 hits
Its gonna be filled.
HaberDash very full
Understatement of the century?
:D hi donutpop365!
I think I might just leave the computer on all day tomorrow, to reserve my spot. @_@
couple a hundred I guess
You guys ever watch twitch tv? The amount of spam when a speedrunner gets a world record doesn't even compare.
Seeing how full it is already
There's already 50 more people than usual :D
I can just picture the game of thrones meme in my head
Brace yourselves...
Remember the derpy chat stream
/me doesn't brace himself
It'll be like that
MadSurge: i know, right? :D
So, every Friday we get two movies?
why don't I come here more.
ive seen it
yup
Question: What's the difference between theatres?
Yugo: Mane chat will be closed, so side rooms will be open. :)
There isn't.
and two user picked episodes
They are just different things.
different audiences
Wait, I just left and went to Rarity... but- wh
Yugo: Nothing. Just controls chat traffic. :)
I saw all you guys in Rainbow Dash.
So it's just to split the chat load then, ahkay.
AJIsAwesome: It will be GWEAT :D
It shall be GLORIOUS~
untill s3
Otherwise a post will be off the screen
in 1 second flat
What do you mean by side rooms, AJIsAwesome?
the pony rooms
MadSurge: Which one you gonna be in tomorrow?
Yugo: Like channels such as Applejack, Pinkie Pie, etc.
tommorrow I'll be singing "finally the moment has arrived"
so it goes like this
Oh, so we're actually in a "mane server" right now?
Hey, just a quick PSA. Read the rules and FAQ if you're new. Save yourself some trouble.
FOR ME TO BE ONE LUCKY GUY
Is there anything running on the stream right now or is mine broken?
please join the rarity room, it's so quiet :(
nothing's playing atm
how to train your dragon>pony episode>jetsons movie>pony episode>10 episode pony marathon?
donutpop365: isn't it obvious? Pinkie Pie :D
ty Solidness
Make sure to read the Rules and FAQ like Ninjazz said. It makes things much easier! :)
Wait wut.
I'll be back for the movie
does anyone know what time they're streaming season 3?
in europe round 4 in the afternoon
tomorrow at 9am cst
Should be 3pm GMT
Well, thanks for all the information guys! I'll just read the informationstuffs and head to Applejack threatre, because she's my favorite.
10 AM.
EST.
|:3
alright, thanks
UK BRONIES, IT'S AT 3PM
:)
REMEMBER
pinkie pie theatre
i dont know wich theather im gonna be in
3pm, I should be up in time for that...
How long until it starts, folks?
...But...but...
i changed theatres but i still see the same people in the chat box
*Cough* AppleJack *Cough*
this is the same plaaaace o_O
4h17m for movie here
i assume it only becomes separate when its filled up?
I think?
YOU NEVER ESCAPE :[
exactly pony_8721
pony_8721, they open only on movie night.
well that explains
a lot
plus main room is linked with all theatres
The FAQ explains much, I hear. Might a great idea to check it before I have silly questions.
Yeah I'll read into those now
loser
?
??
rarity is the best pony
because i dont have one.
Snow spike?
Deacon: NOPE
Deacon: Spike doesn't have a chat room
How long until the crystal pony episode, then?

When I try to join #Applejack from here it says I need an invitation? I'm using a clinet (Pidgin), not the site/Bronystate client.
08,01i thought i'd just cleared the channel's ban list
donutpop365: They open on Movie night only.
I think the room's closed right now
^
08,01i just typo'd -bb instead of -b
-bb?
certainlty is alot of bans
BlazeAngel: Ok, so joining that way at the right time WILL work?
08,01my client translated that into two commands: /ban *@*!* and just /ban
|:I
Muffins
donutpop365: Yesh. :3

08,01the latter of which listed all bans
08,01all 409 of them.

BlazeAngel: Ok, yay.

donutpop365: Im here to help. :p
BlazeAngel: cylon!

:(
but take in mind to not spam a whole lot of them, we've seen it too many times it'a annnying
Yugo. Y U SO HEAD BANGY?
Is there a fan-fic describing Luna's fall to Nightmare Moon?
Because I tend to ask questions too hastily and people are likely to start hating me for asking too many questions. :<
Deacon, it's a possible ban.
Solidness: plenty.
wouldn't say that, it'sa just annoying
there is no hate here
Name some?
Shizuschlafen: What's with the name change? Or is that the original name?
No hate
Deacon, It is. Read dem rules son.
only tolerance
donutpop365 that's her sleep mode name
and bans
Deacon: Ah okay, thanks.
donutpop365 schlafen=sleeping, it's her status

/me is now a chair?
CHAIR MODE ACTIVATE*boop*
/me sits on AJIsAwesome
Solidness: lots of different... "interpretations"... I think there was a more traditional one in My Little Alicorn, an interesting one in Background Pony

Sola Streams happen during the week when a moderator here feels like streaming (Protip: Don't pester them about streaming). Before an episode, there is a stream of the channel it will broadcast on. It's best to get everything working than to set it up right before the live broadcast.
Enjoy a text wall.

Hi, RDash5000. :)
/me enters with a great bang
05,15Also, Season 3 spoilers are an instant ban. So remember that
I only go on there for Drawfriendstuff
i know some people who saw episode 1 of season 3 leaked. they asked: U MAD? Me: YES I MAD!
hai RDash5000
RainbowAsh: I think it's gonna be a really good ep. Just curious if people will react the same way I did or not, mostly.
If we let Mane open during the episode... 7000 strains of spaghetti would be unleashed
So to my regular friends, which side rooms will you be using? I usually use Pinkie's
But the content seems to be a bit poor lately
1000 years ago in equstria was messed up
Read the Rules or you will get sent to Magic Kindergarden while serving 1,000 years in the dungeon

Discussion of anything S3 is forbidden.
What if you "spoil" it, but it's a lie? That's a ban?
RaveBrony: I think more great art will come along with S3 episodes.
just imagine if someone waved a laser around the Crystal Kingdom...
wowviewer: Even fake spoilers are forbidden.
05,15wowviewer we take that stuff very seriously
don't ever spoil thats not good
Zamer: And, well, any serial killer really.
Yes. Because how are we supposed to know which spoilers are real and which are fake.
Ah okay. Just wondering
Thank you :P
You must abide by the RURUUUUUUs
Would it be a spoiler if I say it will be awesome?
Kammerjunk: Yeah, haha. Ive got to work hardcore to improve my art... :(
05basically
But that's against the RUUUUURUS
CriticKitten that was because someone told them a spoiler
fluttercry: can we spoil the episode name?
tombstone YYYEEEAAAHH!!!
Like I said, Crystal Empire clearly needs rock candy. For obvious reasons.
the RUURUUUS!
Swag it up
Besides, rock candy is delicious.
Discussion of anything S3 is forbidden.
Hey AJIsAwesome which side room do you use for new eps? I usually use Pinkie. Problem is us regulars may be split up during the ep if we go in different rooms
RaveBrony: I gave up and started focusing completely on improving my Java.
05if you joke spoiler. like "spoiler: S3 will have ponies" is jsut as likely to gain you a ban as a real spoiler

All my friends who watch it say Matt Smith is the worst
inb4 battle to be won.
Hi
How to train your dragon was a good story its just that the voice actor is sooooo anoying.
MattSmith is a good Docto
how to train your dragons a pretty good movie
hai SnipsandSnails
the only reason why most people go for Tennant is because he had more time to develop his role unlike most doctors especially Ecclesion
6_9
Thanks, I was not too sure.
My favorite episode has to be Green Isn't Your Color
Baking these treats is such a bitch add a teaspoon of Godzilla
i like dave more
find a pet smile smile smile and flimflam brothers
derpy
Smith is good doctor
I like all the episodes equally. :)

Fluttershy is his favorite pony.

also another question has anyone read scott pilgrim or seen the movie
I got McDonalds pony dolls: Twilight and Fluttershy
Spike should be in How To Train Your Dragon.
Tennant would not be the same with the Ponidorica
pony_4942: link?
cross my heart hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye
well the reason for that was because they weren't sure how it was going to be for the relaunch so they originally planned to do a new actor per season
