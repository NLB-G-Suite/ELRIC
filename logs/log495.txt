As Luc Besson wrote the screenplay for the film Taxi, he always wanted Samy for the lead role, because he was much impressed by the short cooperation with him.

1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original script had a much darker ending. After Stansfield shoots Leon, Mathilda performs the grenade ring trick and opens her jacket to reveal the live grenades. It was changed by Luc Besson, fearing that the audience would not accept Mathilda's transformation from innocent girl to crazed juvenile killer. Besson had never intended such a transformation for
1,11the character.
06leak = DAD
This bank sucks
Fuck it. Imma buying this movie so I don't have to put up with buffering shit anymore.

Random Movie Trivia: This movie was a gift from Luc Besson to Jean Reno
100 bucks? Man, Tony is a prick :p

she's 12
1,11I prefer that original ending.
damn it tony!

DA GAEM IS OVVA

She just got massacred.
Game Over.
Silverscreen: you want the bad end?

The plant was saved

Hopefully Hot Shots isn't a buffer fest like this movie.

Once upon a time there was a crazy bitch named Matilda. And she was so crazy, that everyone died. The end.

the darkness and the shadows scared me so much, i AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED!
Yeah. When some of us are lagged but I'm not, it something the mods can fix by turning down the bitrate. When I get lag on my awesome ISP, it usually means it's a problem with the streaming service.
i had no stream issues at all, not even a single lag during whole movie
no panic! all rumours about a radiation leak are lies!
sergio_scriptor: oh cool! :D
well I gotta go to work, cya later :)

otakon: that one too :)
Suprise: nice :)
WUUT?! LimeV is Free Stream tool? O.o
I found that site ages ago :)
ah i was hoping for the Monty Python Intermission music lol

:3 Derpy
Yeah, but it kinda sucks
SMOKE EM IF YOU GOT EM!
Yeah
BATHROOM BREAK!
Vordox: You think we'd pay for streaming??? lol
We need Monty python music

3Hello everypony! We have five new bronies in need of help. Weâre hoping to raise $2500 collectively for them, so please come by and help these great people out.
3First up we have Krill from Ask Queen Chrysalis. Krill recently lost her job, canât afford internet, and is in danger of having nowhere to go.
3Next we have TJ Carson of Ask Pirate Dash. He lost his job a month ago and is currently living on unemployment. He has a wife and 3 year old child and really needs the help.
3Bitter Frostâs mod (link to mod blog) was also fired unexpectedly. She doesnât have a permanent place to stay and currently only making money off of commissions, which isnât enough to live on.
3Then we have FlavinBagel of Ask Gamer Ponies who was also fired and needs money for rent next month. He is currently unemployed and looking for work.
3Finally, Leigh of Ask Fizzy is behind on bills is and can barely support herself and her fiancÃ©. All of these are really great people and it would be awesome if we could help them all out.
3We will be streaming all week starting on June 9th at 6 PM CDT and ending on the 15th at 6 PM CDT. Get ready to have some fun and contribute to a good cause!
3For this fundraiser, the ones you are donating to: Ask Queen Chrysalis, Ask Bitter Frost, Ask Pirate Dash, Ask Gamer Ponies, and Ask Fizzyâs blog authors, will be giving out commissions to the five people who donate the most. Theyâre only doing one commission each and you must be in chat for when we announce the winners this coming Friday at the end of the event if you want a chance
3to win. Highest donor gets first pick of artist and so on. So, keep donating for a chance to win and help out a good cause!
3And not to mention, besides our wonderful blog artists, there will be some more special guests making an appearance for your entertainment. We will have Bree Faith (voice actor of Pinkie in the Epic Cupcake Time series), ROBCakeran53 (author of My Little Dashie), the staff of Everypony Sings, and Saberspark. So come by, watch some streams with our guests, have fun, and remember to donate
my system says my i3 has got 4 cores, even though it's only got two real cores irl.
3to a good cause! Thanks!
1,11Holy Textwall, Batman!
13i see we fixed the autokicks :3
04Basically, go donate to help out some Bronies down on their luck :)
3it doesn't start just yet, but it will in a couple hours. the channel we'll be using is #bronyfunds
06yea, um, hint, i already said i dun really care, i know how the system /somewhat/ works and are still studying/learning, so i appriciate the freindly help, but i prefer discovery over teaching
06still, appriciated :3
1,11I would like to add that the user of Ask Berry Punch/Ask Ruby Pinch/Ask Colgate has recently suffered some run of bad luck as well. They aren't a part of BronyFunds, but they deserve some love as well.
11,01We can add them next time.
02!Shipping
11,01Also, if we hit our goal, I do a special stream (maybe).

Why dont we all move to Australia?
Nittany_Discord: wait, come to Canada :|
Walks back away Silverscreen
Very_Silly_Filly: Which still sucks.
Judge_Holden: It's censored
I want to move to Canada or UK... Only thing I need is a job.
11,01I heard Canada was corrupt as well.
Silverscreen: is there any Canadian mods? :D
Meanwhile: Yeah, but wer're still holding out fine
Nittany_Discord: seems that way, like they NEED help
1,11I honestly want to move over to the UK. At least they aren't f*cking pansies when it comes to homosexuality.
PONY Plenty of opportunity in Canada
Very_Silly_Filly: Crap, forgot that.... ok, what about New Zealand?
Nittany_Discord: I suggest Canada
Nittany_Discord: only in Alberta :P
Dunno.
We need more richfags in the brony community
We've had gay marriage and full LGBT equality since like 2009.
Biglaw: if your Canadian, otherwise you gotta marry
FalreChaser: im european (from portugal) and let me tell you stay the hay away from here,all the countrys are falling with the european economic crisis :( you would be better of in australia
Silverscreen: like how? non homophobes or something? i dont like homophobes
I'd say discover an island and all bronies live epeacefully on it
otakon: you're*
Biglaw: that is my goal, I've been going through Immigarition stuff lately...
05heck even the dept scrub program here gives enough money for house food and basic clothing Bjornfot: we sure can laugh ourselves lucky
If I ever had the money, I would just live on an island
Judge_Holden: NO, the envirionmenta AND the flora/fauna want to kill us all
:3
Very_Silly_Filly: id just make a portal to equestria
yeah, Sweden is pretty good when it comes to gay rights :3
yeah Wrek, but then we do also have the highest taxes in the world
PONY Well I wish you the best of luck, and that you succeed
1,11The US is full of homophobes, and even worse yet, they have power in government.
11,01The #1 thing that broke the straw was voluntary ISP snooping. I hate how our attempts to fight for internet freedom are for not when those seeking to control can buy their way around laws.
Hrafn: yay Sweden!
Britain treats gays like they do normal people
otakon: Hmmm, good point. In that case why not New Zealand?
/me goes to Canada
In theory anyway :P
Silverscreen: I oppose that statement
Silverscreen: buck the homophobes, assholes.

I MUST FIND PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN ALBERTA...yes...I must find them..mwahahaha...
PONY Canada IS one of the most Diverse coutries in the world! *and the 2nd largest*
hopefully the movie wont derp
Universal health care isn't a good thing. It comes at the price of huge taxes.
Let's see how the stream goes with Veemi. <<.
Hungary also has universal healthcare but I would rather chop my leg off than go to a hospital...
Biglaw: I know.
currently the only real habitable country in europe that its not in economic crysis is switzerland
06possibly, but the powerhouses from now start above 550? i think
Kandarihu: we've already got huge taxes on people who can't afford it while the filthy rich pay the lowest they have in decades
if someone does move to Canada please move to Alberta, its lonely here :'(
winning
1,11@Nittany_Discord: Then they are sued for violating the privacy rights agreement that are part of the deal when you click "I agree to the terms and conditions"
sergio_scriptor: all the swiss banks obviously
Biglaw: UK would be nice too, but the job situation is bad.
Let the games.. begin!
GUIZ I KNOW!! We all move to FINLAND!!!
charlie sheen
I swear, I'm the only Brony in my town.
Now that I've got that out of the way, it's sheen time.
05Kandarihu: then again the hgih taxes arent a problem once the universal healthcare and otehr universal things get into practice
Judge_Holden: sounds good
i didnt know he was in this
lol
11,01Those things are quite one-sided Silver.
Was there a part one to Hot Shots? :D

The upper class are the ones who pay the greatest proportion of their own income in taxes, though. We wouldn't have an employment problem if the rich actually were charged fairly.

Biglaw: Popcorn is never complete without butter :(
05Kandarihu: even if they have a high income and even greater tax, the "ricH" would still have more than enough to live on. its a matter of greed
Judge_holden : today its all crappy parodies like epic movie :(
Ponies47 agreed
1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Saddam's refrigerator contains items such as: Hungry Nomad (Hungry Man) Microwavable Milk carton advertising "2% Camel Milk", "Olde Iraqi Beer" and "Falafel Helper". When Saddam makes a sandwich he seals it with, not Saran Wrap, but "Saharanrap".

Bronysith: both are great movies

is epic
I like to pick One Piece Movie 10 for A movie and for the B movie, it's a somewhat trollish surprise. Nothing offensive, though.
04Is this gonna be a parody of Bloodsport?

Most people here cannot enjoy the Gintama humour, as it's very classic humour about Bozus and Hikki...doris? Moris? The Gintama way of producing it's jokes, so yeah. Take it up later when we're going low. :)

Rain: Aliens
Rain: compression
Pinkie Pie is too damn cute in that suit :S
04Hi!
Rain: She's pinkie. that's all you need to know
HI
lol
Ghosties: You have been giggled out by our ponies.
Hi Ghosties :)

Guards: DGAF continued

Fail gaurd
Guard has epic voice :D
04Where does he keep getting that ice cream
Well, it HAS been a week
-lol- Ah casual jho guard pony...Love that guy.
Ghosties magic

Ghosties: I think Pinkie pie

I. DONT. KNOW.
Ghosties: A null void
hammerspace Ghosties
guard has same voice as Shining Armor and the red dragon
Ghosties: EVERYWHERE! :p
Pinkie has Ice Cream stashed all over Equestria. For Ice Cream emergencies.
'dat troll sun
04DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY
Ghosties: Pinkie scattered ice cream across Equestria. For ice cream emergencies.
nothing happened
Red Dawn
Litwick: Beat you to it :P
Yay Celestia, I wonder what she was reading.
Ghosties: Ha! /) thank you -lol-

TROLLESTIA STRIKES AGAIN
trollestia cameo
HAPPY TUESDAY!
Happy Tuesday Everypony
HAPPY TUESDAY!
XD
DED stream
Trollestia strikes again
Ugh, that Trollestia.:\
Tuesday is Pony Day
HAPPY TUSEDAY!
no wai
i think she looks cool
I liked Celestia's voice there
you look awesome
Rain: me too, "Happy Tuesday"
GarrettBrony: Yesterday was PONYDAY. Today it is PONYDAY
Tuesday is Email Fellow Bronies Day
and thus the time loop begins again...
the moral of this story is this: Yesterday is History; Tommorow is a Mystery; but today is a gift, that is why it's called the present :)
IT SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKING WAR ZONE WHERE I AM
04NO YOU FOOL
No, she's a chicken
04YOU COULD HAVE BROKEN THE LOOP
AND THUS THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE!
time loop
wat.
/me RyunosukeKnT claps
Someone hold me :(
Nittany_Discord: Hmm, maybe you guys should do some sort of weekly update on Tuesday, exception for the newsletter. Like soms sort of connection to the real life.
11,01Litwick: Video!
Litwick same here
Ghosties: she just completed her own loop
Ghosties: if she did the world of Equestria would have been destroyed.
Doesn't even read the spell... casts it like a pro
Holds Litwick
/me is not scientifically possible
nope.
/me hugs Litwick they still filming die hard there
04BUT SHE COULD HAVE BROKEN IT
11,01NommyDash: Wut?
actually ghosties, cant, because twilight met twilight in the Past
Big_Macintosh_1992: she IS the Element of Magic you know.
Nittany_Discord: Yeah, like the friendship scrolls system.
dat hoof to the mouth
RyunosukeKnT: nooo the moral of this is time travel can buck your day. but nice message :)
Ghosties: but then the world would explode, cause then nothing wouldve made twilight end up with the time spell
Now we watch the episode over and over again in an infinite loop :)
otakon: i know... still
/me calms Ghosties down and gives him ice cream
STILL looks awkward
Ghosties: If we go by your logic...WHO STARTED THE LOOP!?!?!?!?!?
THAT WOULD CAUSE BAD TIMEY WHIMY THINGS GHOSTIES!
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOOOO
if she didnt act like a dork here, she wouldnt have gone through all of this and therefore she wouldnt exist in that version.
Twilight fail
04Fuck time paradoxes >:I
Loopsies!
Rain: EXACTLY
Ghosties: ANSWER that Ghosties :P
Twilight, cheer up.
GODDAMMIT WHEN IS MY B MOVIE GONNA GET PICKED
DED
Is movie night not over?
lol enjoy the pain, past tilight
Twilight finds out the spells are in the starswirl building and tells herself abouit it. PARADOX COMPLETED. FUCK YOU BACK TO THE FUTURE

Nittany_Discord: Maybe...:P

FlareChaser: Is it a clopfic? 0_0

FlareChaser: NO, YA DON'T SAY

Meanwhile: How the fuck did this happen.
Did someone say frying pan? http://derpy.me/7wbFx (Is a YouTube vid BTW)
WEEEEEEUUUUUUUU

I'm guessing it was Nyria saying that he's going down~ on someone.
ScootaChicken: I blame...Idk. All of you.
Which is kinda weird.
0,14No video links during stream, Eddmario
I agree, lets all blame ScootaChicken.
When I played this game this is as far as I got to the first boss. I haven't played it sense. AND I HAVE 2 WII'S! :P
Eddmario: lol
And btw guys, isn't it kind of confusing that Nintendo annouces two New Super Mario Bros?
Nyria: You still haven't wished me happy birthday you wee shite.

Flutters: i think this game only uses the wii remote on its side
Oh, Oh, Oh For the longest time~

Hi, alexxm ! My day's been great! I've been working out.
How was your day, alexxm
SuperBrony64: Did you start a new game?
good Randomnerd
Well, I'm gonna go play Paper Mario TTYD, but I'll leave the stream open on my laptop
This game = Super Mario Bros 3 1/3
does anything happen if you jump through the ring
SuperBrony64: if new super mario bros U has online multiplayer....we must do some coop :P
Hey Bronysith, how was it?
ScootaChicken: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/21780837.jpg
Nyria: Nice
Nyria: xD
I should be sleeping.
CupcakeWarrior: wat? i was applejack and she was rainbow dash
Nyria: Can someone translate this to our language?
RainbowcrashNBurn: NSMB:U now has online multiplayer! bad news, its completely random and you can't turn it off (ala Dragon Souls if I recall the game correctly)
14why am I still awake
Nyria: Great choice of words. :D
SuperBrony64: I JUST BEAT REMIX 10 TODAY. HOLLA AT A PLAYAH.
14why most of you european people are still awake
14o.o
I hope the Wii U has support for the Wii Speak.
08,01Litwick: exactly
Bronysith: Is she in the chat room right now?
hey guys im going to get me some root beer
that was easy
11,02Litwick: CONGRATS :D
TAKE THE KEY
xD
03because it's a weekend?
Well, Excuuuuuuuuuse me, Princess!
Oh, wait..
08,01honestly, i don't think i actually have an upper bound on the amount of white chocolate i am able to consume
/me is back after having a snack
no i mean at home
NullRadix: i havent played dragon souls, you mean you cant choose who you play with?
Who agrees that the Wii Speak needs to be supportive for the next Smash Bros and the Wii U?!
Fleur?
14k :D
I can guarentee you that they'll have to heavily monitor he Wii U's chat system after the first day, since it'll be full of dicks. Both figurativly AND literally.
SuperBrony64: I did the worst on Night Walk and tap Troupe though.
yes cupcake?
World 4. tasty
Fleur: Were you with Sith?
http://imgur.com/gallery/HDCgy
ya
so whatde i miss while gone?
VenHur96: the wii U controller has built in mic i think
as I recall, I was told in Dragon Souls people randomly join your game, and mess with you. It's always on DRM and you can't turn it off so the game is unplayable for new players

Howdy y'all!
hoya!
Hi Everlasting_Joy!
giggle at the ghoties
Howdy Everlasting_Joy!
fucking boos....
NullRadix: im surprised nintendo would do that, considering they made you use friendcodes for online multiplayer with friends, which was a bit annyoying in itself
hey Everlasting_Joy hows your day bee
0,14oh hai Everlasting_Joy
OH GOD WHAT IS WITH THE AD THAT JUST APPESRED
/me hugs Everlasting_Joy hello
Hold on folks. I'll be right back.

OK WHAT I ALL IS TALK ABOUT A LYRA PLUSHIE!?!
no. i'm too lazy to move from my position
so what's with the lyra plushie? Did I miss some context?

Ponies47: have u seen it?
egh never mind
WE MEET S
A
MahBoi777: Nope.avi
Hello all
i dont think we are alllowed to talk about the lyra plushie >.>
hey Big_Macintosh_1992!
Hey Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
I won't
the whole plushie thing annoyed me, lyra is one of my, (if not THE) favorite background ponie(s) for me
11,02What's the deal with the Lyra plushie?
SuperBrony64: It can be used for ANYTHING
Ponies47: you'll just have to look it up lol
oh gawd not THE lyra plushie
SuperBrony64: Big ordeal about a plushie with a hole in its but intended for a penis.
the use the maker clearly intended sickened me :(
SuperBrony64: no idea to be honest
MahBoi777: Fine :|
It's an impractical oven mitt.
sagas: please tell me that this is not a real thing....
I's a uni
otakon: it's real
otakon: It is
08,01Critchleyb: nope
its a horn cozy
otakon: sadly, it is
did someone actually make one? or is it just drawings?
there ya go, it's an oven mitt lol
:( Oh God why....
08,01when we announce him officially (once we have confirmation of some other things) we'll make that clear on the site
/me just learned about this "lyra plushie" and wishes he hadn't
alright coolio
Hey ask me a best pony question guys
Big_Macintosh_1992: LOL
08,01all the 20% Cooler tickets are sold now anyway
SuperBrony64: Non-bronies found out about it and tried to use it as fuel to hate us. Bronies didnt really give a fuck and took it rather humerously
yeh
/me pats Big_Macintosh_1992 on the back
08,01so it's not like we're suddenly changing something
naro, just wondered
/me facepalms at the Lyra Plushie.
I would buy a SuperBrony64 plushie, but without the hole of course :3
Stylish~
narp even
Its not really a big deal, Big_Macintosh_1992
DAT BATTLE
WE MEET AT LAST
I'm actually kind of indifferent to the Lyra plushie.
Lyra Plushie, if you think about it, it can be funny
11,02I'm tired of this game now :3
OH DEAR GOD WHY IS THAT A REAL THING?!
SuperBrony64: What do you think about the Wii U?
WHAT
Who really cares about the plushie. To each their own
sagas: i know.... just not what i was expecting
otakon: it just happens
Tired of Mario?
otakon: I know!
08,01Litwick: if people want to think of ponies sexually, that's their own business. personally, i don't see anythign wrong with it.
big mac is that you its moopy dude
SuperBrony64: but you could have WON
SuperBrony64: :D
SB Translation: RAGE QUIT :3
sagas: what the non-bronies forgot, is that every fanbase has people like that, whether people like it or not
11,02Randomnerd: Love it ^_^
its not funnt, its hillarious
Play something else! :D
O_O OK NOW I KNOW WHY WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
lol
SuperBrony64: I would totally buy you an Allie Way plushie
Dat windows error
08,01RainbowcrashNBurn: exactly
Ponies47: yea lol
To each their own
There's a R34 of everything, no exceptions
08,01i bed even homestuck...
08,01*bet
Aeina: you dun say
Litwick: I said indifferent. Meaning I don't honestly CARE about the Lyra plush.
11,02I LIEK ALLIE WAY :D
of course even homestuck
homstuck has buckets, I'm sure.
11,02And Derpy too :3
Anyway
:O King of the Hill time?
08,01otakon: people do that with *everything*, though
MahBoi777: Dats (squee) up.
LET US MOVE ON
Why does everything explode?
otakon: It is meant for that. It said so in the sellers description
08,01otakon: why not?
SuperBrony64: Derpy <3
I AM EXCITED FOR THE WII U
11,02ME TOO :D
yay :3
I was washing the dish of my lunch, then I founded out NSMB Wii is over. aw well.

It promises many ways to pass the time with frineds!
Randomnerd IKR?

otakon: the world just happens, you can't control it
Friends you have magical friendships with.
08,01otakon: i should put down the chainsaw
I've already got some cash saved for it
I'm excited for, but skeptical of Wii U to be honest.
Simon: true
08,01because you are stumped.
otakon: Oh. Well to each their own. As long as they arent hurting anyone, let them have their plushie
Derpy_Hooves you must DIE
SuperBrony64: same here, only bit im disappointed in is *shudder* Nintendoland, but thats clearly the wii sports of Wii U
not sure what to think of the Wii U
Eeyup
I'm gonna buy one now
08,01GabeMoist: ****THE MORE YOU KNOW
MahBoi777: Its awesome
08,01hey derpster
Your just sombody that i used to know...
Everlasting_Joy: It will probably be lousy at first, since it will have too few games.
08,01otakon: why?
otakon: Nothing is always too far
otakon: Like I said, to each their own
Hey guys do you think i should chug this root beer thats sitting by me over here?
08,01otakon: why should you care what people do in their bedrooms to dolls?
12 MILES AN HOUR? :O
Never watched King of The Hill before.
Randomnerd: It's not the short time I'm worried about.
HAHA
08,01it doesn't harm anyone, so let them have their fun
CupcakeWarrior: have they said what it would cost yet?
Nope
08,01so long asthey don't rub it in our faces
should i do it?
ah
08,01figurative, or literally
If otakon cared about the shit I do in the comfort of my own bedroom, he would probably hug me.
03http://imgur.com/gallery/AG90B
what is this
ScootaChicken: huh?
give me a yes or no
08,01ScootaChicken: i want an otakon hug too :(
oh no he didn't!
otakon: Well others found out about it and spread it. Not the seller. Blame them
i want muffins
sagas: aye
if i should chug this root beer
i LOVE this episode
OH GOD THIS EP
08,01otakon: as i say, no-one's rubbing it in your face
Derpy_Hooves: me too

08,01because that would be kinda messy
5th or 8th time and yet SHE'S A TEACHER.

Derpy_Hooves: I think she's a great character
Derpy_Hooves: Why do you have to hate anyone?
im happy that ACIII is coming to Wii U, although the reason why is a bit hard to put into words :S
ok here i go no more bets
bye guys
Derpy_Hooves: u are not alone

If I lost 100 pounds, I'd be loosing organ mass as well.
"Wednesday" is a freaking weird word.
So I didn't really follow E3 (and I haven't for quite a few years)... is the Wii U intended to be their next console generation or some sort of peripheral?
Randomnerd: 15 isnt that hard! You can do it!
sagas: thank you :)
sagas: I'd be in my supposed weight range if I did, but I put NO faith in BMI bullshit
Everlasting_Joy: Lol
FillyFlam: It comes from "Wotan's Day"
otakon that's a false stereotype about us texan's, our BIGGEST stereotype is: "Everyone from texas wears a cowboy hat"
Aeina: console, huge grahpical upgrade from existing Wii
he has NO ass
hey admim i just chuged the whole root beer here
lol
I'm gonna go take a shower. BRB :)
dat ass
otakon: do you know any Texans? :D
dat plot
Derpy_Hooves: oh
To quote Jitterbug Jive "HE CAN'T SHIT!"
SaneSurge: Derpy_Hooves is a texan
ewww
otakon: I can agree with that. I have a high BMI, but im very muscular
otakon: I know a Texan lady. she was awesome :)
ah, and I gathered from the online reactions to E3 that MS and Sony didn't announce anything of much note, ok :P
sagas: I'm fairly muscular
BEER GUT
BEER
sagas: I'm stout
She's a mortician, which is kinda weird.
Randomnerd: I know. But it's one of those words where if you say it a thousand times really slowly, you're just like "...wut"
Derpy_Hooves: Don't mind otakon, he's a bit racist to everyone.
LOL
brb need a sammich
Yes, shoes are fake feet
It's a misunderstood job, like practicing Law.
hey guys whens the broadcast going to start we have been sitting and chating for like a minute
Scootachicken: i really dont care, im not as stuck up ass most texans are ..>
silicone ass implants
as*
lol
balance things out
What part are you from, Derpy_Hooves ?
Aeina: MS announced something that is clearly a rippoff of the wii U controller, and Sony announce a smash bros ripoff
San Antonio
central texas
I think most big states have bad reputations as being stuck up.
BIG BUTT :D
California, NY and Texas.
HANK HAS A FAT ASS!
Derpy_Hooves: The lady I knew was from that area, German and Mexican.
Ha @aol.com :D
ahhhh
0,14wait, people think of NY as stuck up?
Well ill be dipped
0,14I thought our schtick was we're rude and pushy
SaxyPretender: I thought your shtick was that you said 'Cwoafee'
its deflated
i mean, yeah our biggest stereotype is :Everyone from texas wears a cowboy hat", but unless the rodeo is going on, you will never see me wearing a cowboy hat >.>
inflatable butt
/me 11,01dusts SaxyPretender
0,14o_o

but that stereotype is somewhat true
Derpy_Hooves: The fact that youde wear them anytime says enough
:D
buttboobies
I think that's only in the media, when they want to portray someone from texas
is this Maid Hour?! :)
i mean if you go to west texas, litterally EVERYONE is dressed as a cowboy
Oh damn

Mmm Fried Chicken would be awesome right now.
Wood Chips instead of grass?! :O
Derpy_Hooves: thats cool :P
propane emergency??
Do not light any matches
The stereotype about New Yorkers makes even less sense, as half of the people in the state are not from NYC.
so yea, in west texas, that sterotype is 100% true, which makes me feel glad im in central texas
I've only been to Arlington
Derpy_Hooves: Texas is still Texas

Hobbyists?
At least your stereotype isn't "Inbred hicks who take their morning coffee with a lynching." >.>

AWW YEAH
DaringDude: /)
the law of gravity is really more of a suggestion.
Whats this? We're watching anime?
...
yay!
Angel Beats?
anime
seems like a Sumica stream
MahBoi777: (\
seriously.
Rainbow Dash is the best pony
otakon: laws of anything dont apply to pinkie pie
00,10nope
13gravity, it's not just a theory, it's the law
08,01Spectrum_Plush: i thought it was shizu?
Suddently, best art direction ever!
yeahno
i'm out
Pinkie needs no laws
pony_3xxMoopyxx: /)
/me hits otakon with a car's bumper
13people must have missed the part where the intermission signs off with me >>
/me 08,01steals Shizuka and feeds her cake
I've only seen about 2 animes
Shizuka: indeed, but Pinkie has a "Get out of jail free" card.
Shizuka but a Theory IS a "law" :3
/me 11,01dusts Shizuka
why are we watching this crap?
Shizuka: I figured it was you, so what is Angel Beats?
00,10You wonte see a timebar or controls when I stream
I MY COMPUTER DERPED AGIAN :(
sorry Shizuka wasnt looking
11,01Shizuka: I saw it <3
13and at one minute twenty seconds in we have a complainer
08,01sagas: you want cake? be as awesome as shizu, then we'll talk.
Nittany_Discord: Are you the same as Discord?
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
pony_3xxMoopyxx: if they streamed ponies all the time it wud get boring
Shizuka: is that like a record?
waow
00,10all that is in the win7 taskbar for my player
11,01I'm not the same as Discord.
the fake ones that die faster than you know what?
Awww the jap dub?
I totally want to be fed cake now.
Nittany_Discord: are you related to Q?
04But you're Nittany_Discord :o
Okay good, because last time me and Discord met he tried to kill me
The guy with the glasses.
pony_3xxMoopyxx: You must be new here. The streamer streams what they want. If ponies played 24 7 it would get boring
8,6pony_3xxMoopyxx, we're watching it because we fucking can
Nittany_Discord: you're still quite chaotic though:)
13besides
11,01I'm a Discord, not the Discord.
I HAVE NO IDEA!
they do
chocolate milk
Egh fine
13this episode is like 99% slapstick
00,10more like Discorded Nittany.
plus they don't have the same ESR ratings
kirzstryfe: good enough...
kirzstryfe: I AGREE! :)
Wait, is Discord in the dicktionery?
Nittany_Discord: are you related to john d lancie?
/me 11,01touches Sumica
EW
so they don't work well in digital electronics
this is very difficult to watch, type, and read
before i found this site, i avoided Anime, now i quite enjoy it :P
DUDE
00,10lower
:P
bad touch
8,6lol
My legs are flipping twitching like crazy! :[ y do i still run!?!
pony_3xxMoopyxx: you must be new here.
RainbowcrashNBurn: ditto
11,01Shizuka: Did you show the opening yet? I must have missed that.
in this case electronics repair
11,01Ep 1.
/me gurren laglomps Nittany_Discord
RaveBrony: Because it's good for you
Maybe
13yeah
/me 11,01explodes
13week or two ago
Pause the stream. A third of the work disappears.
11,01K.
HEY RaveBrony! exercise ftl
yeah
its the parts built in Indea and china shipments really....
what the hell is this about?
11,01Missed that.
RaveBrony: You could always do Burpees, they are very efficient.
the fakes are Chinese
the real Nichicon caps are made in Japan
And if you shut the f:Ok up, another third of the work disappears.
RaveBrony: RUN LIKE A MAN!
yup
08,01so many "kun"s
cause nobody can hear me in the ibrony chatroom
Randomnerd: True.... but i just ran for 1 1/2 hours... i dont think THATs very good for health :D im practically killing myself! :D
Step 1: Do burpees.
11,01Oh, this ep.
Then you turn off your monitor, and your work completely disappears.
Step 2: THERE IS NO STEP 2.
MahBoi777: Haha, nah :D
the power supply board was Nichicon and Panasonic
lol
seriously? this?
11,01In heaven, you have to take final exams for all eternity.
11,01No matter your grade.
RaveBrony: hope your just kidding about that
FlareChaser: I did!! But the pain! X_X
lol. Fascinating show
the main board was a no name brand called L.H Nova
LOL
RaveBrony: very impressive
superretroworld: About what? lol :D
Step 1: Break into the compound. Step 2: There's no way we're getting this far.
Nittany_Discord: thats heaven for you?
RaveBrony: suicide
Step 3?
China/ India export brand
RaveBrony: an hour and a half? damn lol
Is this guy new to this or what?
cheating much?
the backlight inverter board is questionable too
Nittany_Discord: what if they fail?*i just got here*
*Opens Cheat Engine*
11,01My heavens a tornado outbreak every day.
RaveBrony: WELLL, Obviously, we have a pain in Raves legs, hes climbing in your windows snatching yo blood up.
i must have missed something, what are they trying to do?
WHAT DID I MISS?
I might recap one I took out just to have a spare
Nittany_Discord: Sounds more like HELL.
*Fails at using it*
no doubt
RainbowcrashNBurn: same here
08,01what is this?
*Closes cheat engine*
very nice animation though
08,01why are they being horrible to that girl?
08,01why are their eyes so big?
superretroworld: No no no, youve got it all wrong! I meant 'running for 1+ hours' is doing more Harm than Good to my body :P
her eyes are so big!
cowbell
O_O
I would question its viability too
08,01what's a japan?
13so to strike a blow at Tenshi, who is evil, they're going to swap her answers out with nonsense
BRB
11,01High-risk 45% tornado risk every day.
11,01Hatched.
MahBoi777: Mhhm :D
08,01otakon: i prefer it the other way around

08,01big mouth, fast hands...
08,01GODDAMN BATMAN
11,01Shizuka: Did they reveal her name yet?

My power went out yesterday, so I lit my dining room table on fire for warmth.
13actually
13here
RaveBrony: feel the burn

Shizuka: lol
Ohhh, Canada....

RaveBrony: lol, yeah but i did hear running or walking gets helps with depression or bad emotions
seriously THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM?!
you also should learn how some circuits work
13i love his~
when they operate normally
8,6aren't they already dead?
11,01That must be a fun afterworld where you can die over and over.
mods, mods everywhere.
superretroworld: Really? O.o hmm, good to know! :$
13presumably it's painful every time
11,01They are already dead.
kirzstryfe: shush I don't think we're supposed to know that yet.
Shizuka: why is she so determined to ruin the other girls exam?
Nittany_Discord: we need VioletVanilla back :'(

Hey shiz

Dat music
:3
I got into mother boards first too, wanting to know where and why it can do what it does and what is bad verus good
Dancing
FlareChaser: What happened to ViolentVanilla? D:
one of the best ways to troubleshoot something is to learn how it is supposed to operate normally
Shizuka: like controls as in alters reality to suit her whims or just her little click?
0,14protip: do not call Shizuka Shiz
RaveBrony: I dont know D:
yep
brilliant
fine
*violet
RaveBrony: Real world issues, but she's okay
RaveBrony: shes been gone for awhile now :(
Oh, ok

08,01yes.
He isn't ripped! He's in one piece!
...The heck are we watching?
08,01otakon: she did it first!
so that once you get into the real thing your chances of success are higher
ok, i no longer care that i dont know what they are trying to do, the method is hilarious
HoboAddiction: Angel Beats
/me 08,01points wildly at Shizuka
otakon: o////o ?
HoboAddiction: welcome to bronystate, a chat place for all bronies, welcome to the herd :)
Never heard of it :S
WHY DOES HE HAVE A GIRLS VOICE?
dem eyes
those eyes
Heh it would be better if some pony talks like that
also be careful about applying heat and desoldering
08,01otakon: i love it when you're angry o////o
otakon: why does timmy turner have a girl voice?
MahBoi777: beatchya too it :d
Must wash mah face, brb
13otakon: same reason a middle schooler in english dubs has a 30 year old's voice
FlareChaser: bc Tara Strong is awesome
So what exactly is this about?
/me grabs a left turn sign "oootaakoon..."
dat finger waggle XD
Shizuka: lol
/me 08,01skips along singing trololololo
What is this??
XD nvm then
if you are not careful you can lift a pad or damage a trace on a PC board with excessive heat or too much stress
Purple`Prose: Angel Beats
No! bad!
DaringDude: Lol
Heh raging!
Ahhh

THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS GIRL?
I know some japansese so this is really funny to listen to while I write
Shizuka: Agree!
OC?
superretroworld and OneTrickPony HI!
wait...does that guy still have his shirt off?
I have an OC :
I STILL don't know what's going on
OC?
03yeah, apparently when my keyboard was broken, I pressed a key on it and it erased my CMOS
03not sure how
Hey guys whats going on in this stream?
So why are they tring to scew with her?
I have an OC! :)
8,6lol
Hey shizu put on phoenix wright
EggWhite: Japan
lol
WHY!?
wat
lol
lol
drf just reminded me of something
13pony_3xxMoopyxx: hey pony no
dat song
03I'm uploading a video of what happened
if you are going to repair computer system boards
03somehow the keys got all mixed up
how in the hell...
REMOVE THE CMOS BATTERY
pony eeyup
03a was typing b and so on
Shizuka: you don't like Phoenix Wright?
Slo-mo is best mo
I could watch that scene all day, along with Superpan...
make sure the board is totally dead
OC?
i watch it sometimes
03yeah, but for a keyboard to cuase that?
no power going to it at all
Honestly, this animation is wasted on shomething like this, it could be used for something more action-y.
Ponies47: Show?
8,6if requests were being taken, we'd let everyone know
Sumerpan ish best hero Omiright?
so many animes, lol I love it
I have an OC!
Ok I was just playing Magicka for the #bronyfunds stream.
03I think what happened was it put my computer in some sort of hybrid sleep mode, and the only way I could get out of it was to hit reset
me too! :D
just put it on real qick
03but even then, reset button shouldn't mess with CMOS
11,01DaringDude: Yes.
Dat Omnomnom face
sagas: You wanna see it? Sure Gimme a min. :)
0,14hey, pony_3xxMoopyxx
0,14ARE YOU OKAY
what
BUFF
wat
All of the things I came here for aren't here T_T
pony_3xxMoopyxx: don't push mods to do something, they do this as basically a favor.
I think this show is a little too crazy, even for me.
DaringDude: of course Lol
WHY does he still not have his shirt?
it might have been something else
8,6lol
but that is still pretty weird
Man after this day its so nice to be hOme
welp, too late
dat body
03yeah
03I'm just glad that AutoSave worked
I guess we won't be seeing him again
03as I'm in the middle of writing a paper
WHY would you even touch something with power going still, it makes me afraid of hurting it possibly
03and would have been pissed if it erased it
ok sorry jeeze
03LOL
03Avis I used to be a noob and fried my PSU
03when I was like 12
03I thought it was fun to spin the PSU fan with a paper clip
Ohhhh
Ok
sometimes its necessary for performing tests
03until I touched the metal and it fried
03XD
but there are specific points for doing so
At first i thought she had put bOmbs under their seats XD
pony_3xxMoopyxx: yeah, never make demands of people that do this for free.
03yeah, I've tested PSUs
BOMBZ?
u want it?
Is Angel Beats good? I haven't had the chance to watch it.
11,01pony_3xxMoopyxx: I think you need to read our FAQ.
03yay shorting it with a paperclip, only in the non-harmful wahy?
03-h
mm
FlareChaser: that'll be your day :D
MahBoi777: can i have some credit?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GIRL?
FlareChaser: dont you have any shame boy?
superretroworld: HAVE WE MET BEFORE?
sometimes to get them to come to life outside a computer its necessary to short a couple pins
im kina lost...
www.bronystate.cOm
sagas: don't know, don't want to know :P
but they are very specific ones
11,01EggWhite: It is good.
/me stands up
DaringDude: >.> now you are doing that on purpose
No XD
twilight_sprinkle: what? for stealing all the ponies that wonder into the real world? no.
/me wets himself
maybe.... :3
sorry RainbowcrashNBurn, I don't give credit, come back when you're a little MMMMMMM richer!:P
*Me gusta*
as they should be
FlareChaser: we've only talked a few times
Im sorry ok im jusy lazy here no need to get mad at me
Operation Tornado
MahBoi777: couldnt resit getting you to say that :P
and then suddenly music
04Moopy, we don't do requests all the time. If you don't like what we do then go on YouTube or play it yourself :)
Operation Tornado?
superretroworld: how do you know what pony I like? ._.
people who work with electronics try some strange things from time to time
good animation
FlareChaser: wha?...i meant stop advertising yourself all the time...
RainbowcrashNBurn: Lol xD
I think he gets it lol
04And it's fine, we all make mistakes.
but they do so safely
wow dats good
I seriously have NO idea what's going on
Who pinged me?
He's been told by like 20 people now xD
Ugh........fine im sorry to every body
11,01The guitar girl left already :<
Operation_Tornado: oh come ON
Operation_Tornado: ping!
radio people do weird things too
13yep
twilight_sprinkle: oh...that too... anyways, no I dont, I want to get well known as a Brony. :3
I would know about both aspects
guns!? WTF!?
13she got her wish of playing the music she wanted to
13and disappeared
oh
*sigh* Have a good night guys. I get to go work at a grocery store all night.
FlareChaser: youre getting well-known as an attention hog
WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING?
FlareChaser: you were obsessed with octavia and your username was flarechaseroctavia
11,01I've seen Angel Beats.
sagas: singing
Night Big_Macintosh_1992 :)
kewl
superretroworld: :3
When guns appeared out of nowhere..stuff is getting real.
i still dont get why they wanted the girl to completly fail all the exams
11,01So I'm being careful about spoilers.
08,01should i eat a fish?
13good series
twilight_sprinkle: k, its in my nature.
FlareChaser: not to mention you linked a pic of octavia on here :D
smells like trout throw it out
11,01Shizuka: It is.
FlareChaser: The people with GUNS -_- why do they want to kill her!?
I hated it when those guys touched me...
FlareChaser: fight it?
one example is lighting up flourescent tubes with RF
sagas: because the ycan :3
08,01wow
Nothing can penetrate it?
lol
08,01i just realised the fish have veins
FISH
this works for CFL lamps too
Evening, everypony! :) How are we all tonight?
It feels wrong when the soilder people touch me :(
less power is needed of course
twilight_sprinkle: honestly, I cant really control what happens now because someone pings me, I respond, and then it starts up a big conversation.
Has anypony seen Gamer_Luna around?
Sylandest: Tired, you?
SO SPICY!
FlareChaser: ok we both know thats not true
08,01Ponies47: try my bed; if she's not there, i have no idea
/me glomps Sylandest
inb4 ded?
Om: I am as well, lol. Quite so due to work, but im still alive
Ponies47: not today
wait....first they sabotage her exams, then would overwise kill her if it wasnt for this weird circumstance
MahBoi777: howdy! :D
hey Sylandest! I'm fine, how are you?
okay no really WHAT is going on?
13they can't kill her
Sylandest: Guuuray
08,01sagas: i have no idea
with me they can, I shoot bees.
I am SO confused
MahBoi777: im good, lol, just exhausted
otakon: She usually comes on everyday :(
SO VERY VERY CONFUSED
They're all in purgtory
what, the crap, is going on?
/me can shoot bees.
Ponies47: well like I said, haven't seen her today.
08,01*bees
otakon: its anime what do you expect
basically, they're all dead, and the afterlife is basically a school.
08,01everything!
mm
08,01*buzzzz*
08,01is!
DaringDude: something COHERENT
08,01*buzzzzz*

O Japan
I WANT THAT!
08,01now!
08,01*buzzzzz*
BEES!
08,01beeeeeeees!
I don't know if my name means something...
AHHHHH
I can't wait until One Piece 551 is up and I can finally watch something that makes sense :P
13this is ep 5 of 13, you're along for the ride now
sagas: it's apparently the afterlife
otakon: Okie doki loki :)
08,01*buzzzzzz*
NOT THE BEES
There's a group of students that are trying to force the circumstances to change.
I had a 50 watt VHF transceiver that would light up F-40 tubes
mfw i first tried hot cheetos
Shizuka: and THAT explains it. MIDDLE OF THE SERIES MADNESS.
otakon: So theyre all dead?!
MahBoi777: oh god! :D
MahBoi777: No....:D
nope! its just Flare Testa
sagas: apparently
08,01RainbowcrashNBurn: yes
:D
13it's not self-contained
08,01twilight_sprinkle: what?
otakon: Now im even more confused
08,01what is code geass?
NommyDash and Sylandest: LOL
twilight_sprinkle: you and your Code Geass
The girl with white hair? An angel that's basically there to keep people in lime
line*
yarg, I woke up :)
Bronysith: is Bronysith and Bronysith in Bronysith
Bronysith: Is best Bronysith :P
Purple`Prose: but i wanted to be a tree :(
That was me! :D
08,01twilight_sprinkle: maybe i wasn't clear
ty Ponies47
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i've never heard of it
that looks yummy
when death isn't a issue it always drops down to pain
Anypony see me on the table?
08,01last anime i streamed was that one with the Grim Reaper
i want more epic slapstick causing flying chairs
/me grabs a pistol and eats it
RainbowcrashNBurn: I think it comes in waves
13it gets better
those require 40 watts of power to iluminate
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i don't think i did
13but it also gets extremely emotional
otakon: eh, that animes just brilliant imo :3
RainbowcrashNburn: I do wonder if that's an running gag in the anime?
Shizuka: why middle ep though?
Does it ever make any more sense?
Shizuka: or did I miss the first eps?
13cause i streamed 1-4 before :3
08,01twilight_sprinkle: actually, i seem to remember downloading something like that, but i don't think i even streamed it
Can we watch Redline again?
HoboAddiction: this is the middle of the series
08,01Purple`Prose: no, we cannot
Purple`Prose: that's Sumica's territory
aw...
I think I should check my e-mail... I've been avoiding Rope...
Even so, I doubt it would even make sense if I myself made it.
that was pretty good
YES YOU HAVE, Chains!
suddenly invasion?
03http://imgur.com/gallery/iUYZ5
13because those guys aren't shielded like kanade, they can't fight them
Oh, f:Ok...
Can we watch something that makes more sense and is an english dub?
oh s:Ot
00,10you know saying my name is gonna make me come look
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i do have it, yes
Shizuka: okay, and THAT concept is?
Hey big macintosh i sent you a message while your not on the xbox dude

twilight_sprinkle: this isnt a movie... its beastwars
PIZZA TIEM

Wait, is this a crossover episode?
what kind of weapon is that?
13sagas: in 3x01 he absorbed Prime's spark to stop the paradox megatron set off
Shamroc: its my way of trolling him
0,14...oh I'm guess you already showed THAT episode
Transformers meets Beast Wars?
SaxyPretender: eeyup
the animations terrible
I WANT A SHITZILLION dollars lol
Shizuka: is you streaming Rifftrax gonna be a regular thing, if so when? or was it just a one off with matrix last week?
Shizuka: So this is related to Transformers?
HOLD UP
RainbowcrashNBurn: it'll be random sadly
Bronysith: wud u settle for a trillion?
sagas: it IS Transformers you idgit
Okay, Optimus
Sagas, it's cano several hunderd years after G1

MahBoi777: shitzillion is trillion

/me pees in a jar and hands it to otakon "Want some lemonade :]?"
RyunosukeKnT, the current events yes. the characters no.
Transformers?
13no one reads the bottom of the screen where it tells you
at*
Shizuka: they switched his gun arm in that shot
xP
Mutterguy: thats why I said kinda :)
13megatron?
Shizuka: yeah,
Quick question - when does the Care Bears show air on The Hub? Is it the 23rd?
13they tend to play a bit loose with which arm his tail is on or whether he's got the tail or a normal arm
Dinobot? HOW?
Shizuka: ah
last time i saw dinobot....he sacrificed himself?
otakon....I'll give you a hint....its a rifftrax
13somehow, megatron cloned dinobot
WOW
nice
13he did it before, and the clone didn't have dinobot's sense of honor
HOW do you clone a ROBOT?
Shamroc: also, nice.
13now he's done it again but with transmetal II tech
otakon: with science
MahBoi777: SCIENCE!
Comradinski: actually i think the first episode may have already been aired
/me dons his labcoat
Hrm
XD
Guess I missed it, then
13YEEES MEEASTER
I might see about checking it out soon, though
woah nice upgrades
03http://i.imgur.com/wKt9a.jpg
the current one lacks Dinobot's grace and humor and intelligence.
laser vision?
OUCH
CANT TURN OF LAZER
RainbowcrashNBurn: well he DID have eye lasers as his primary long range weapon before, this one jsut seems more powerful
13is it me or do the spikes on the machine look like they belong on an oblivion gate
nice
8,6lol
Shizuka...indeed they do
that is absolutely hilarious
Shizuka: eeyup
Hello Everypony !
otakon: fair enough
and WHAT just happened?
I have to save the gripe sheet one
Apparently The Hub already has episode 5 up on their website. Looks like I'm pretty far behind... :P
that looks painfull..
BRB, listening to sad shit

hiya Alister how are ya?
hi Alister
13oh and as i noted before, after Code of Hero, rhinox is never seen in beast form again
Shizuka: for some reason, even though he's not transmetal
otakon: Great , I just bought Mass Effect 1 and 2. Imma tap dat *gets shot*
kirzstryfe: There is no S4 of Beast Wars. After this is S1 of Beast Machines in which they do return to Cybertron.
/me is dead
Heh i like the auto turrets with the lights on
Alister: nice, do you have ME3 already?
otakon: I won't buy it
13after the planet buster all the energon on earth converted to stable cubes
Alister: you should, the ending can be bypassed really
Shizuka: ah

13she's turned
13halfway or so
otakon: pretty sure shes freelance
working out some..demons
otakon: I don't care about the ending , Mass Effect 2 and 1 feel like real sci-fi stories. the 3 feels like some overdramatic JRPG story
13ducky!
Shizuka: well, turned back. She was originally a Maximal
Bath tub?

04Very very nice
Someone should make Tay Zonday and the Chocolate Rain Factory...just kidding.
superretroworld: it's Rifftrax, where they make snide and snarky bits about it while playing

Hi Quadrenaro :)
Damn grandparents! Should put them in a home
Shrunken Death Puppet

The Tim Burton film is actually closer to the original novel in tone.
Ghosties: i love this movei.. reminds me of my grandpa when i watched it with him all the time. may he rest in piece
/me poops
04Surely you don't think that Depp did a better Willy Wonka though
They must be fucking disgusting!

Ghosties: hell no
Granny Smith should've gone to the chocolate factory instead
0,14;__;
I'M HAVING A PARTY TOMORROW

Shizuka: it's the power of HOPE
Ghosties: Not better. Just more like the lunatic in the novel.

00,02this is from when tobacco was acceptible
SayWhat: Sure
13JUST SAY NO, this anti-smoking message brought to you by wonka they're-totally-not-just-as-addictive chocolates

What's with the robot voice?
spy sappin mah chocolate!
hahahahahahahahaha
0,14JERSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY
Shore.
Shizuka: I think disemboaudio is the BEST bit
8,6the riffs have been doubled! :3
13the robot is Disembaudio, who says lines in time with the film so you know the track is synced
I do not appreciate slamming someone just because of thier habbits, whether it be smoking, or ponies, or whatever
slugsworth?
kirzstryfe: and ALL rejoiced
13Rifftrax is just an MP3 you play along with the movie
Shizuka: make it even funnier
PEGASI
whos sluhworth?
04I'll say this, when I read the book back in fifth grade I was terrified of Wonka. He honestly seemed like some crazed axe killer that would routinely, every year, round up select kids under the ruse of a "contest" and then torture them and turn them into food to be eaten by people everywhere. Yes siree, Willy Wonka scared the hell out of me as a kid.
I love this guy
moonshine?
Ghosties: lol
Holy
Someone killed a chicken on my screen
Wait no
I'm going to a party tomorrow! (I think) For my 4 year old cousin. I hate her so much :|
That's just Ghosites :3
13yes let's let elementary school kids screw with explosive chemicals
Ghosties: I never read the book! :p
I'd laugh, but i was more mortified at the children when they left.
Ghosties: you thought he was a serial killer? :D
Ponies47: don't do that
and how Wonka didnt care.
04Yes
8,6I see nothing wrong with that
0,14^
random chemicals = fun!
otakon: Do what?
I kind of has the same reaction as Ghosties, but I watched the remake instead of the book.
NOT DOCTOR HORRIBLE
While you guys were busy reading Willy Wonka, I was reading the dictionary under my desk (I was a trouble maker)
Prick of a teacher
04He was...just god, Wonka shrunk kids and one kid turned into a giant blueberry and then another got stuck in a chocolate vat...
13ohhhhhhhh
NOOOOOOOOO!

Hey whats the best chatroom besides the bronystate?
SaxyPretender Mmmmmaybe.
This was not in the novel. It was added so that there would be a "moral" aspect to the story, almost obligatory for family films of the era.
13bronystate obviously
Bronystate
LOL
Shizuka: do you got a golden ticket?
pony_3xxMoopyxx: Besides? You under estimate bronystates power~

13if charlie has been living off laundry water for so long...
Alister: People that are more crazy about this competition than people are about the lotterey. And I know people would kill for a mega millions winning ticket
13even though he just had the chocolate bar... how in the world does he have that much energy..
0,14Hope is a powerful thing.

SaxyPretender: you like cowboys don't yo?
0,14...FUND IT

SaxyPretender: ALL THE FUNDING
13saxy... are you okay?
FUND IT WITH THE WHITE HOT FURY OF A THOUSAND WONKAS
another random fact: it was SUPPOSED to be over 8000,further proving that dbzkai is loyal to the manga
0,14SO VERY OKAY
It's the CCCP!
but charlie is the only onone who gets out of bed alot
8,6lol
sonicrainboomer259: eeyup, but over 9000 is JUST SO EPIC.
Back in the day, many SF fans postulated that Willy Wonka was actually a Time Lord. Seriously. Fandom can be odd.
04Obviously Neil would be a much better Wonka than Depp and Saxy knows this
Bah, this headset is nearly dead. I'm off to see if I can find something less stupid to use for sound output.
That Agustus isn't that fat by today's standards
00,02* SaxyPretender has kicked SaxyPretender from #bronystate (BUSTAH WOLF)
00,02XD
/me vanishes
So

Kencolt: makes sense actually

Not sure if being trolled
LOLLOLOLOL
Phase4: lol
13mm dat encoding bug
04OH GOD
04VIOLET
I was arguing with this guy....
Cue Rainbow Factory music
04HOLY SHIT
otakon: tru,tru..............
Almost anyone would have been a better Wonka than Depp
OH GOD
he's a spy.
what about ps2
SO MUCH PURPLE
I think I'm gonna play Kirby Airride now
00,02Violet is secretly a building
It was mostly because this movie came out during Tom Baker's run-- and the eccentic clothing just seemed.
SWAG.
I liked Depp as Wonka :(
And he was saying how I hadn't done my research about the Wii U, right?
i like runts
Kencolt: eeyup
shamroc, runts?
HEY KIDS WELCOME TO THE RAINBOW FACTORY! :)
the fruity hard candys?
YEAY
Except later in that same post, he states that the Wii U uses 4 tablet controllers
why is he walking so slow?
NOT SURE IF BEING TROLLED
The9001thPony: the candy that looks like fruit
i'm gonna go play minecraft later
pony_3xxMoopyxx: just watch
Gene Wilder=Awesome
4 tablets?
Fine
i thought it was only 2?
Shamroc: That candy is awesome. :3
At lleast he's using thye cane properly.
13aaaand at halfway through the movie we finally have a line from wonka
Lol Cane troll
04COMBAT ROLL
0,14Do a tumble roll!
CK|GW2: this is the Rifftrax of WWATCF.
DO A BARREL ROLL
d3rb: It is only 2. It was never 4.
>_>
help ive fallen and i cant get up~
TROLLOLOLOLOL
00,02and that line is "Thank You"
It's actually called an Aileron Roll
Do a barell roll!
0,14hahahaha
he looks like a retired veteran
ah....okie dokie :)
0,14MENUDO
|Discord|: i love the guy who played wonka
Shizuka: Gene Wilder is best Wonka
Which is why I am wondering if this guy is trolling me or not.
come to me, children
gene wilder is best pony
Do a Wonka Roll!
CK|GW2: he was trolling
AJ: He sounds like a pedo. No offense
"Welcome to my chocolate factory" is what i say to my hookers
And the Pogs.
Why out of all the people in the world are the winners white?
sagas: the 70's is why
sagas: now just ENJOY THE MOVIE
Do a Sweet Roll!
Now that I think about it... I think Wonka might actually BE a Timelord
That explains it!
You can't say "durr 4 tablets" and "do your research nub" in the same post, that should theoretically create a singularity of stupidity that would extinguish all life in this universe.
His factory is a TARDIS!
who-else has seen autarch of trololo on top ten game endings by joshscorcher
Stallion_of_War: Gene Wilder would make a great Timelord
YOU'RE DED
otakon: I was just wondering. Didnt know the 70s were so afraid of minorities
CK|GW2: we're lucky then
04RAPTURE!
See, I love Gene Wilder as Wonka. AND YES, I WANT TO SEE GENE AS A TIMELORD
Wonka is dead. Roll credits
lol
04Welcome to Wonka's RAPTURE!
Litwick: too bad he's dead :(
sagas: 1) the 70s, 2) if there are kids in the developed world who can only afford one Candy Bar a year, the developing world is probably screwed.
otakon: He's what?
otakon: That won't stop him.
Litwick: dead :(
8,6gatorland >.<
The way the door opens is against fire safety regulations
lol
otakon: Y-you're joknig right?
I'VE BEEN TO GATORLAND
welcome to gaterland~
otakon: I don't think he's dead
0,14speaking of Disneyworld, apparently my grandma told me the very first time I saw Mickey, I was in total awe, on the verge of tears
He's Gene Wilder. If given the part of a Timelord, he'd just come back to life to accept the role.
the chilidogs there are DELICOUS
13when do we get to the rides?
wonka wasnt excited when meeting charlie
call me what you want, but i laughed at the chocolate tunnel scene
Welcome to Willy Wonka's Wheel of DOOM!
SayWhat: Do they have those fire regulations in Germany ?
one creepy mother fucker
Gene Wilder is still alive
Remember -- the Doctor Lies. SO does Willy Wonka.
HE IS ALIVE!
HAND STOLE MAH HAT
Alister: Probably
00,02nothing dangerous, except all that dangerous stuff that happens later
I AM SO GLAD TO BE WRONG!
8,6Wonka ToS
Alister: However, they're German
sagas: I mean in this wonka-world. There are people who can afford luxury items in the developing world in our world. Not enough, of course :(
SayWhat: Pics or it didn't happen
GENE WILDER IS ALIVE BUT RETIRED
Terms and conditions~
0,14be lucky we don't have a ToS like that =P
nothing dangerous but being sucked up a giant chocolate pipe, running out of air and dying, SEEMS LEGIT WONKA. :d
13pff
13no one reads the rules we have now
this parts scary
XD
8,6what rules?
I saw Gene Wilder interviewed a year or so ago. He looks really really old these days
8,6CK|GW2, which server are you on?
Shizuka: we have rules here?
No matter how much I love this film I'm of to sleep. I'm 5.5 h over due. Good night everypony
I read them! I just type in caps a lot.
coughcoughchocalteridecoughcough
Good night, Nerom
Shizuka: eeyup

Who doesn't love CANTERLOCK?
Alister: trying to find some :3
00,02http://www.bronystate.net/rules/ they're here if you're interested
night again
So the movie is halfway over and they finally enter the factory
can you pause it when he does that meme pose
call me what you want, but i laughed at the chocolate tunnel scene
hey guys, whats the biggest lie on the internet?
Soap. That's Ivory Soap. NOT CHOCOLATE.
Randomnerd: I LOVE LOVE LOVE CANTERLOCK! :D
yay closet!
SayWhat: pics of German fire regulations ? good luck
If you haven't read the rules yourself, does someone else citing them count as a spoiler?
99 44 100

Alister: MUST FIND
NullRadix: no
LO
Calm the fuck down, people!

kirz: I'm on....uh....dun remember. XD

04"I am Willy Wonka, and I am here to ask you a question. Is a child not entitled to his chocolate? No, says his parents; they belong to everyone. No, says his friends; they belong to us. NO, says the school bully; they belong to ME! I rejected these answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose...oompa loompas!"
