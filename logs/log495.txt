11,01*Sweden
Why dont we all move to Australia?
1,11I honestly want to move over to the UK. At least they aren't f*cking pansies when it comes to homosexuality.
Good things are happening in America. I'm not sure how long it'll take before you see it. But I'd advise you to stay in America. And keep on not depending on the government.
Dunno.
We've had gay marriage and full LGBT equality since like 2009.
If I ever had the money, I would just live on an island
:3
yeah, Sweden is pretty good when it comes to gay rights :3
PONY Well I wish you the best of luck, and that you succeed
1,11The US is full of homophobes, and even worse yet, they have power in government.
Britain treats gays like they do normal people

Universal health care isn't a good thing. It comes at the price of huge taxes.
Let's see how the stream goes with Veemi. <<.
Hungary also has universal healthcare but I would rather chop my leg off than go to a hospital...
currently the only real habitable country in europe that its not in economic crysis is switzerland
06possibly, but the powerhouses from now start above 550? i think

Like seriously, half the states in America legalize horse fucking, but can't comprehend why 2 men or women can marry because of a "5000 year old book" that's pretty much shit plastered on paper.

11,01Shizuka: It is.
I hated it when those guys touched me...
one example is lighting up flourescent tubes with RF
08,01wow
Nothing can penetrate it?
lol
Saturn: sure, even fluttershy doesnt care for fish
08,01i just realised the fish have veins

There's a group of students that are trying to force the circumstances to change.
I had a 50 watt VHF transceiver that would light up F-40 tubes

/me grabs a pistol and eats it
Saturn: but..but..you downloaded it for weeks, and then streamed the first ep, you were busy preparing for exams at the time
Saturn: Which one?
those require 40 watts of power to iluminate
08,01twilight_sprinkle: i don't think i did
Does it ever make any more sense?
13cause i streamed 1-4 before :3
08,01twilight_sprinkle: actually, i seem to remember downloading something like that, but i don't think i even streamed it
Can we watch Redline again?
