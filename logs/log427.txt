If Paul wasn't dead, he'd be a brony today.

Disney would have bought up the Ponies?
Hm.
03ugh, now I'm starting to get tired
nooo
03I guess I can sleep now
03I think I failed that exam x.x
noo...
If Disney bought ponies, I wouldn't be a brony.
Disney sucks bawls.
^
^^^^^^^
Walt Disney the original creator of Sleeping Beauty and ETC.
If disney bought MLP. I would die.
Wild Bill
It does now...
14D:
Twice.
Hasbro isn't much better than Disney, all things considered.
04heyho

04back from vacation :D
Yeah but Hasbro doesn't make the show.
PINGAS
^^
Team Faust does.
I think walt disney would make his kind of Ponies O:
only thing i like from disney is the donald duck cartoon "der fuhrers face"
GO TEAM FAUST!

Hi SlurryMoon

Most modern animation owes its existence to Disney, like it or not.
True.
Hiya SlurryMoon
if waltdisney was still live that would be a triumph
its 00:00 pm. EVERLASTING JOY WOOHOO i love that i have my own room xD
3Nice to see you all
Even the "South Park" dudes have to define themselves in opposition to it.
So many people that died way too early...
Ohai SlurryMoon
But we can also credit Disney for most of the animation problems we have today, as well as corrupting a good number of our youth.
Bono?
Wasn't that a singer/band?
Or when Family Guy made fun of Disney -it still has to define itself in terms of what Disney IS.
is it LeeroyHoofkins or Hoofroy Jenkins??????
Hoofroy Hoofkins
[ImNamedLewisJenkinsLawl]
Radu: bono is the singer f U2
Hoofroy Jenkins.
Oh right
My Sister in Law used to work in animation, I learned a lot about this stuff from her.
She doesn't know I'm a brony :$
but then she took an arrow to th kne
Got distracted. What happened?

i already imagine a cake with nutella and all the ponies.
Why you no capitalize Tuesday.
Chuggaaconroy got a Pinkie Pie cake for his birthday
Because I don't respect tuesday.
Is Chugga brony? :s
lol
yeah i'll make with all ponies :D
AND I MEAN ALL.
No, mostly because he hasn't watched the show
bronyhood of steel ;)
Dat Wrek lurking
Then why give him ponycake
His friends are fans of the show.
And they said that he's a lot like Pinkie Pie.
Doesn't make him a brony.
He IS a lot like Pinkie
My brother is the male embodyment of Pinkie Pie, and he hates bronies.
guys who wants me to send them a brony card with a cupcake with Pinkie Pie?
It was actually just a pink cake with Pinkie\s cutie mark on it.
And he NEVER KNEW. Until his fans told him.
Pink cakes......

Pink icing is best flavour

His hat is a boot, therefore your political arguments are invalid

But I remember Cap'n Price being in the second game.
Anyone played the Walking Dead game yet?
Everything Nuzlockes for a Nuzlocke.
There's a walking dead game?
Kammerjunk: He was in 4th as well
First game was a MOH clone. CoD4 was a trend setter. Everything after, consumer milking.
Exactly.
Yessirreebob

Tell Tale made it.
Dem rads, mon?
They don't usually make sinkers.
You could catch a few playthroughs of it, but then you'd be spoiling yourself. It's getting very good reviews thus far, though
Jim: the power rangers n64 game was good
After 4 tries and 2 breaks and 2 relogs my guild maneged to kill Deathwing
BTW: Cpt. Price character was based upon that guy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McAleese
for realz?

After 25 tries and 3 trips to the target, I finally managed to hit a tenner in archery.

Yes
I do
Nope.

Wooo /)
Wrek: You know where they drop those barrels full of radiation
stargate is an old movie and show... of course i know it...
Know what Stargate is, but never got into it.

Oh. Is it anything like Star Trek?
dat trolling
Aww yeah
ive never seen star trek
From what I've seen, no.
star trek is best cause of Discord
See, Stargate is awesome. Stargate Universe though... no. Just no.
Dunno, I'd have to see it first.
CrimsonPhoenix: isnt that next generation though

NO WAIT
OMG SG1 REVIVE

I dunno I never saw Star Trek :D

Uh oh?
Did you see Star Wars?
of course
saw some trek, never watched star gate.
Star Trek: TNG, best of all Star Treks
Yes

What is a Star Wars?
You have to have seen something with the word "Star" in it by this age.
Who has't seen star wars dude
13atlantis was good
^
Ninjazz: its a War of Stars... obviously
Ohai Shizuka
My Little Star: Space is Magic
13hallo
Allo Shizuka. Atlantis?
hai Shizuka
i honestly thought that Atlantis was boring
I hear it got sunk.
Atlantis and SG1 were Godlike. Just ignore the existance of Universe.
Hiya
My Little Starship: Fusion reactors are magic.
Hiho RainbowASh
RainbowAsh, welcome.
Hi RankWinner and Ninjazz
Hey RainbowAsh
Atlantis is...?
13seasons 8-10 of SG1 started falling flat cause they'd assumed they were done
Hi pony_6500
13and scifi kept renewing
Stargate: Atlantis
A season of stargate it seems.
OIC.
13xcanox: one-to-one notices are considered rude by irc etiquette
My Little Normandy: Calibrations are Necessary.
Atlantis was best
Yep, then Atlantis took over and begun being even more awesome. And then Universe took over and just failed misserably.
Good.
Atlantis was boring... it only got good near the end of the series, like DS9
My Little Railings: Leverage is Magic.
Universe showed so much promise
Universe was good
then just lost it
My Little Arrow: Knees are Target.
Voyager is best ST.
yeah
/me has not watched any television in the past 3 years
The first bits were decent, the middle was just crap and the end was awesome
Meanwhile: I have to disagree with you there... TNG was best, Voyager was second
Though tbh, I like TNG more than Voy.
/me palms face.
I did enjoy Voyager as well Meanwhile what did you think of the prequel Enterprise?
But I've seen all of Voyaher.
I seriously can't figure out why they replaced Universe with some wrestling show on A SCIENCE FICTION CHANNEL
Enterprise was the worst ST i had ever seen... it showed such great promise though
Sky News is saying that Trolls are a serious danger and that government sanctions need to be put in place to stop them. 6_9
Rodinies: Really? What the hell?
I thought Enterprise didn't exist and should be fired into the sun.
pony_6500: yes
RankWinner proof or it didnt happen
hi everypony
pony_6500: SciFi removed universe because they had more viewers at wrestling shows...
Voyager is the only series I've followed, so that gets my vote as well
hai Onyxia
Enterprise ruined the continuity of the ST universe by bringing in species that apparently dont exist in ANY OTHER SHOW
pony_6500: While universe was aired at a time in which most people couldn't watch it
Onyxia, welcome
Chrysalis: Depending on their schedule the interview should be up soon, I'll link ye' if it comes up.
i suppose wrek is streamin
Thing is although I love TNG, I haven't seen nearly as much of it as Voyager, so I don't really have much of a vote.
And I've only seen like, 7 episodes of DS9.
I must ask, what is that steam notification to the right? Too blurry to actually see it.
/me should watch more good television
RankWinner: Looks like the games ident code.
DS9 is boring as watching paint dry... until the Dominion War starts, then it gets effing awesome
Meanwhile: I thought steam didn't bother with those unless the game has online features that need them. Oh well.
I loved being a highlevel sneaky bastard in this game. Stealth crits are schweet.
imo it was the best of them all. Twenty times better than mother janeway and her big happy family. or wesley.
Midnight_Tempest, ikr, the first season, everyone talks about how exiting it is to explore a new quadrant, and all the main characters do is sit on the station and settle minor disputes
Wrek why is your voice sexy?
Anypony here a fan of Tremors?
lol
I met Robert Picardo once, the hologram doctor in Voyager.
how was he CountDoofus
RainbowAsh: they do that for nearly 4 or 5 seasons... i couldnt watch people on a station not DOING anything...
pyrocatbot: Is that the movie about the giant man-eating worms?
/me is pleased with his school's OFSTED report "The progress of the majority of students across all year groups is well below expectations and is inadequate."
Met him at a convention. He was a bit edgy, but he'd just suffered through a truckload of geeks, so guess I can understand him :p
Sorry, Trekkies.
/me JustLyra
Midnight_Tempest, it gets a bit better when they get that ship with the cloak and actually do go somewhere, but yeah. DS9 is one of those series I would really like to like, but it doesn't make it easy for me.
Wrong thing. Fawk. >_>.
ghostpolitics: You broke into the wrong god-damned rec-room! Eeyup.
RainbowAsh: the addition of the Defiant was awesome, but it only got worth watching in the later seasons when the Dominion showed up...
Omnom meatloaf.
pyrocatboy: I love that movie, haven't seen it in years.
ghostpolitics: I have all four movies.
U mad Scorpinok?
hi alexxm how's ur day been?
Heh, this is so true: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-explanation.jpg
johan?
/me licks alexxm
What's the name of that giant bug in NV again? I hated those things.
Midnight_Tempest, I watched it up to season 3 or 4 some years back. Maybe I should just jump right into s6.
/me is jealous
CountDoofus: Cazadors?
hey pablez94 i've been good
That's the one
Instantly knew what you were thinking about. :D
Cazadors are bitches. >_>...
who wants pizza
Radu: mlp is lick an iceberg uh, well perfect metaphor
ZedRed
Indeed.
like* soryy radu
Shouldn't lick an iceberg, your tongue'll stick.
RainbowAsh: well... you could but you might be confused about some things, some events... otherwise i would recommend doing that
I'd prefer Cazadors over Deathclaws anytime though
Anypony here other than ghostpolitics a fan of the Tremors movies?
hey pablez94 someone humanized tom you want to see it
alexxm, I am going to make some pizze later on tonight. :9
or i'm going to have cancer to my hands or i'm getting stupid.
Tremors was amazing.
alexxm: eeyep
Boom

pablez94 http://www.wwe.com/superstars/therock
I would rather fight a horde of Deathclaws than 2 Cazadors...
Midnight_Tempest, I'll be fine, I got the internet to fill me in. ^^
O U alexxm
Didn't even need to click that.
Because Deathclaws are nothing.
the rock? alexxm r u serious?
in fallout 1 and 2, deathclaws were easy if you had a decent gun skill...cripple the legs and run...
Dat Cha-ching

Everypony's so quiet today!
HeroBrine_theBrone is your username the same as this one?
Guys, how's the weather at your place?
It's raining up.
Rain, flooding and drought.
ok evryony i've got to go to have dinner see ya in 20 minutes 1 more 1 less.
Stupid pegasi. Need to get it right
preaty good today Malavolent
Malavolent: Clear and pretty hot
Shadowsparkle: no and i check its at 12045 now
I'd rather take raining, it's unbearably hot here.
I can't force myself to do anything, just because of this stupid weather.
HeroBrine_theBrone: what is it called?
hi john
HOld on
Wat.
whats the cutter thing called
The Man Opener
So, chat, be creative for me.
If Equestria had a DMV, what would it be called?
/me releses clowns into chat
alexxm
I don't even know what that means!
What's DMV?
Department of Motor Vehicles.
FillyFlam: DPV.
alexxm: -is traumitized for life-
perhaps it would just be for pegasi and would be where they get they're license to fly FillyFlam
peter:leave
Is there a name for the Pony who is "Strangely Obsessed with Tubs of Jelly"?
sorry pyrocatboy
im back
It's the place where you get your driver's license. On the artist training ground the theme is a pony waiting, so I thought to do something with the DMV.
Oh, Wrek's doing that quest now.
Or DLC. Whichever.
hugh jelly i think Randomnerd
Randomnerd: They fan name is Hugh jelly
lol
Thanks alexxm, ghostpolitics
FillyFlam: What would ponies possibly drive?
Malavolent, air ships are canon for once.
they at least have trains Malavolent
ACTIVITY
I dunno, really...
Steampunk is Magic.
LOOK AT ALL THIS ACTIVITY
perhaps it would just be for pegasi and would be where they get they're license to fly FillyFlam
ded
Dear Princess Celestia: I'm so lonely...
License to fly? I wouldn't think so.
I mean, you can't get a license to walk, either.
It sounds kinda weird that pegasus wouldn't be able to fly just because he doesn't have license.
alexxm: Yeah, that could work. I'll have to think of something creative and funny to happen there, though.
ScootaChicken: people kept abusing the bot yesterday, so he died
Oh, oh, maybe the Flim Flam brothers needed a licence for their peculiar mode of transport.
O_o
/me yawns
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
well at least where they learn to fly Malavolent and Kammerjunk
NOT MAGNET
HE CAN NEVER DIE
NEVER
...Flying Cider Squeezy 6000?
Malavolent, it might be for the best, though, considering how much damage a pegasus can cause, like in Lesson Zero
Must happen.
FillyFlam, yes, their mode of locomotion.
RainbowAsh: Maybe, and maybe it would be better to send those untalented flyers to a certain factory.

Good points: It DIDN'T EXPLODE!

Nightie night CountDoofus

Wrek's streaming?
CountDoofus: Night Night!
bye CountDoofus
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4550/
Stuff blowing up in a fictional setting is okay and fun. Stuff blowing up in real life is never a good thing.
Man... i wanna stream some stuff
night CountDoofus
CountDoofus: bye
cya CountDoofus
NMM, indeed no. Molestia... Let's talk.
13you know it is pretty impressive that three seconds in they know it would all go belly up

Why do all you ponies like Molestia?
Shizuka: damn it
IMO she goes at it a bit too much

OmegaMaretroidBrony: read the fan fic
who wants a cookieh
they probably had lots of data coming in and some of it was outside of acceptable parameters Shizuka
I have read the Fanfic
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4494/
As well as Lunaught
I think some ponies don't like Celestia because she appears too upbeat. I think Molestia can be loads of fun to be with. My theory anyways. I don't like her.
*Lunaughty

OmegaMaretroidBrony: The fanfic got kinda repetitive :l

Talking and watching MLP Like a BAWWSS ;)
Awesomeness: The good man streaming is a mod. Only mods can stream
with a limited ammo pool, and no redeeming stats
Wrek: it is unique and the only one of it's kind. Selling it would be a tragic mistake. It's like selling the Firelance or the Captain's Sidearm!
/me "omg my magic is always something bad i keep doing bad tings with it... maybe i should cut my horn off"
oh
DUNT SELL UR ZAPPY GUN

/me starts to Cry near pablez94

Hi everyone
hey megaton :D long time no see.... since i destroyed you
how did you become mod?
CrazyCherry: i'm sorry for this... it's all over...(what did i do)O.O
He's not a mod, he's a robot.
and the fact there there are weapons with far better stats and dont require trips to an alien spaceship to get ammo

Howdy, TwiilightSparkle! How are you today?
13i sold my sould

Awesomeness, did you just became a brony?
Shizuka: Good for you...
/me *Goes AfK"
Sylandest: Good, my birhtday is tomorrow, hope Pinkie will throw a party for me x3
did you get a pony?
You have to make a lightsaber out of the teeth of a dragon.
Your mod colors are the colors of your lightsaber.
Stinky_Pinkie, yeah, although in my opinion Dragon Quest is a lot better. I never liked how Owlicious flew circles around Spike during the day in this one, being supposedly nocturnal and all
is that how you make excellent bread Shizuka?
nah. while ago, i became a brony, but i recently found out about brony state
When will you people learn that the Telly-Webs are cooler!
/me stares at CrazyCherry drops da hacksaw falls on his knees and starts crieing like a young foal
TwiilightSparkle: oooh! I must get you a gift ready! *runs off to find said gift*
eh im feeling sadish again
TwiilightSparkle: I WILL THROW A PARTY :D
oh
Selling your soul to get the ultimate skill in baking?
Hey guys i have a joke....Knock Knock.......

Awesomeness: hahaha

TwiilightSparkle: *runs back* um...out of curiosity, is there anything you might want for your birthday? *squee sound*
OmegaMaretroidBrony: selling your soul is the ultimate skill of baking? ill have you kow that baking the 4th wall into a portal is actually the ultimateskill
ded
Ah, super internet derp for me...:P
U CAN'T SEE ME
Sylandest: Maybe a book?
You just want to die, do ya?

I CAN SEE YOU
I see what you did there
:| TRIXIE
Hi TheRainbowDash :D
BUT U CANT SEE ME+
That_British_Guy: Oh hello!
If I died, I would be all "man I need to lower the difficulty"
the answer was somewhere among the lines of:
Hello TheRainbowDash!
Rainbowash I see what you mean lol, and i'm like half way right now. Dragon Quest had a epic storya and some amazing events spike had to do just to be accepted as his own kind. Hehe, MlP is just so amazing, i love all of the episodes except for 1 of the ones with the 3 fillies that just try to get there cutie marks for the whole episode and fail all the way.
:P
TwiilightSparkle: right right, I figured that...*runs off to find the best book he can*
TwiilightSparkle: Oh, hello there!
ded
dir /s | find /i "p"
TheRainbowDash: We found some one with a synonym of your name
OH Hi, TwiilightSparkle (hugs her from behind)
flutter_spin: i would be like ''respawning in 5,4,3....
hey TheRainbowDash what have you been up to
Hi Dark92Enigma!
Wait, who OmegaMaretroidBrony?
/me comforts pablez94 " it's okay you've learned from your mistakes and that's the most important thing!"
do you guys like underpony's music?

Maybe in Unreal Tournament...
Awesomeness, you should go say hi to him TheRainbowDash
alexxm: I got a super internet derp, but I have to study for my finals.

?wait. i'm so confused why say hi to the rainbowdash?
That_British_Guy: Im stunned.
XD
Welcome back TheRainbowDash! (hugs her insanely close)
Awesomeness: Oh, hello! Good to see you!
Stinky_Pinkie, you mean The Show Stoppers? At least it got a somewhat punky song. The one episode I loathe is A Dog and Pony Show. The dogs' voices are just so grating and there are so many things that don't make any sense.
so what are your finals for TheRainbowDash
TheRainbowDash Hi!
Because Awesomeness your name is a synonym to Rainbow Dash
hey Wrek how many stimpacks do you have? i have over 250 :D

She can be anypony so obviously she is best
Back from epic pizza time :9
You cannot argue with Commander Shepard.
Meanwhile: I can
if this was a true FPS, you'd have to find a damn medkit to heal or suck it up and walk it off
No, you cannot.

Remember Wrek look for the hidden Bracket codes
Good afternoon everypony! :)

Commander Sheppard likes applejack, your argument is invalid
Heya RaveBrony

Pfft, at least that video had a good ending.

O3O
/me waves to BoS_Applejack and N4X :$
So fricking tense lol
FREEDOM!
That_Irish_Guy: you click a word. then the terminal tells you how many letters are correctz. then you click another word. and like that, you find out step by step more correct letter.
00,03l337 H4xx0rs
Do you get anything for collecting all the packages?
/me waves back at RaveBrony
Hackers make me :$
The pride of knowing you collected them all
Scoot-Scootaloo go back to your trickshotting clan.
A perk acutally
What game is this again?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Dat 1337 sp33k :D
FO3
to catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause
LOL!
I wonder when New vegas game of the year comes out
thats my new favourite reaction
OƐO
Its sad that Scoot-Scootaloo is a robot :(
00,03Jelly of my Scopezzz?
I love the equipment you get after the simulation, got to love it
why are they killing chineese soldiers?
oil?
cause the Chinese invaded us
I forget the backstory
that seems likely
liek right now
Kipkat07_Mare: Because they're oil greedy commies
this is the part of the war that the giant robot was built to fight
Gib ALL the soldiers!
ʎɹɹǝɥƆʎzɐɹƆ
compared to Oil Greedy Capitalists
BoS_Applejack: WOOT true dat
Because the Chinese are invading Canada......
just saying
Scoot-Scootaloo: phr33 st00f pl0x :D
1,3CrazyCherry, don't mess with the text
lol Irish actually the US invaded Canada
which DLC is this
All of the one shot
in Fallout
then they pussy out and start The Great War
Kipkat07_Mare : Communists(Chinese) fight Demorcracy or shit and than suddenly there was war
I hope to god my dad doesnt try to buy me a computer with out letting me see what I want
alexxm: Operation Anchorage I believe
Because I don't want a stupid Mac
Nyeh, the back of my ear is wet.
Wrek: kill them all!!
That_Irish_Guy: it's a mix of guessing and ruling out
kirzstryfe: It's not like the rules say it's forbidden!
Bass is now cannon lol
thanks ghostpolitics so hows your day been
00,03^ :'(
And what pisses me off is they know I want a new comp
alexxm: It's been good so far, thanks for asking :)
then its time to buy a regular computer
CrazyCherry: It says that in the rules, mods have authority, that is the first thing it says in them.:P
for the ponies
I'm sorry Scoot-Scootaloo for reminding you of such evil
and yet they go buy 2 fucking Ipads
I much prefer to put in the letters than to have a series of letters... like you would get 5 words then you would have to put them in order
Deserve it for buying a mac tbh.
Meanwhile: huh?
Is it a laptop-Mac?
You're meant to go "RAGLERAGLERAGLE"
Honestly, I would buy Adobe Illustrator instead of 2 iPads
TheRainbowDash: 6_9

Curious Dash?:P
I am curious indeed.

ALL episodes in one youtube video
I saw one with every episode from S1 all at once...

Not enough gold...mine more gold.

03hey, at least that face is less obnoxious than a certain other one :P
Damnit kirz I just wrapped up Last man on earth
nope...I've only played the 3D WoW
03well, rather: doesn't AVI only allow "some" H264? Is the one you set up for me supported?
duno
http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/589540/Comfort-Products-Leather-Chair-With-5/ O_O This One! I don't care if it's leather, that looks like a dream!

How could anyone possibly watch every episode at the same time?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2507/
TheRainbowDash: Oh my, Dashie. I don't know if I'm ready for th- 0_o
03I need to redo the Lugia episodes so they aren't like 1GB per ep
KJBrony, you should look up Warcraft III, it is a classic. The earlier parts aren't bad either
WC3: The Frozen Throne.
Cypresswolf i want that chair, sitting on the bed sucks
LOOK AT IT
too bad otakon aint here http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2507/
Wrek: look at a bright light.
Gunthler: Well, I am...*pomf and sexy eyes*

lol poor RD
I HATE that feeling(inb4 francis)
Corrupt: i am going to
TheRainbowDash: Can I join you two?
Well I cant on this computer, but when I get my laptop, I'll definitely do that :)
Corrupt: Aye
are they worth buying
300-350mb maybe?
gmod ponies are scary
yeah
03no, I mean codec-wise
^_^ I'm off to see if Office Depot has one, If not, I could have it by the movie stream *squee*
CupcakeWarrior: Umm, sure, ok!
Corrupt, I played the original Fallout for a bit a long time ago. It was quite good for the time.
03I was gonna do 225MBish
yes...yes they are...
TheRainbowDash...are you doing weird things again?
250 then
H264 + AC3
Shamroc: I am the definition of weird things and all that is silly.
Haaa, look what I started o_o
I think i will get them after diablo 3
03I'll stick to mp3
its tiny :(
03more compatible
Corrupt: You could get 1st Fallout for free on gog.com not so long ago. I advise to look for it there.
03and meh, would prefer 225 or less
03but I want AVI
this is awesome remix http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mvtCnvieQI&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLbgySSGeM8N9ACsNWaRtH_w

03I've had several people here ask for the Articuno or Lugia episodes so I just stuck them on my server to make it easier for people
03but nobody wants to download 1GB episodes

03why would you zip an AVI
00,03Although, I'm not sure when Saxy would be on
to heat up your room
02zip compresses the file
03no?
......................................
03you obviously don't know how compression works :P
herpderp
Shadow: ??
idk
02derp!
03video files like that are already compressed

Shadow: if you post several in a row you get kicked
in the amout of time that is

http://www.fimfiction.net/story/10865/1/Blazing-Rainbow/Chapter-1%3A-No-Title-For-You%21
Yay :)
TheRainbowDash: Blazing Rainbow Sounds like a Rainbow Factory Sequel where Scootaloo gets grinded.
So its unlikely that an older mobo will support it
TrololoOctavia: No, shipping.
deep packet inspection
other crap
:/
Good greifness
i just want to replace the CPU :P
XD
TheRainbowDash, can I be shipped with you?
No keep reading it gets to ponies
Silent Ponyville
Put your new cpu into an older computer?
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20405/1/Fluttershy%27s-Bad-%26quot%3BHare%26quot%3B-Day/Chapter-1 Fluttershy's Bad Hare Day
Why?
CupcakeWarrior: Umm, no, i got BlazeAngel for that.:D

My Little Fanfiction
no the other way around
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/10865/1/Blazing-Rainbow/Chapter-1%3A-No-Title-For-You%21
because this current CPU is crap
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/16004/My-Little-Pony%27s-Little-Ponies My Little Pony's Little Ponies.
so many fanfics out there, lol
TheRainbowDash: Good, Id rather be shipped with Lyra :3
http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&search=borderline this is good :P a nice physcological thriller
I know I probably sound obnoxious tonight but y'know.
03why not just use the newer computer?
I'm needy.
(sighs):D
13TrololoOctavia: Yeah, we're not discussing that fic.
the newer computer's CPU is CRAP IS WHAT I JUST SAID ><
p-p
yay
the older one is better
sigh
03this is why you build your own
03:P
Shizuka: Good....Grief
>can't afford
this is why you buy carefully
03I could send you a dual-core, but it probably won't work
TheRainbowDash: I can't find the action in it :D
HEH

:(
03what speed?
1.3GHz

How about a Nostalgia Critic episode?
02Okay, 1st, there’s nothing wrong with *killing trees*. That’s how we get wood LOL. 2nd, recycling is very important. Who knows how many trees wouldn’t be cut down if everyone recycled.
023rd, when you trash something just as much energy is going to be used to get that trash to the dump and process it.
!blame for xanbreon being a bad troll
nostalgia critic i agree
makes sense.

NOOOOO
That's okay bud.
Thats ok bro
Wut fic is this
Firefly

Take a drink or two
my throat is killing me... now for some signing!
NO SINGING! I BEG YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
kill your throat before it kills you :O
Wait what...
cachi01: lol
lol
02I can understand that drf. But it’s your attitude about not being environmentally friendly that I don’t like
lol sorry for the fail copy pasta
YEAH
/me is not a loser
word up, Scoots!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
losers?
Surprise It's not firefly, but other one, i requested Firefly
ALCOHOL IS FOR LOSERS
oh my
Alcohol also destroys your voice box XD
whoa
and can destroy your liver
I liek to sing :#
Ponies, Ponies, Ponies...
What is this about?
If its killing you stop reading |:(
Sniped by the Shizuka
03basically
ofc
ponies?
who did that
03here's my philosophy on this
me
What is this about?
btw, my comment has been mentioned
03I'll recycle stuff if it's actually available. Like soda cans and bottles, there are recycling bins everywhere because that's a pretty big thing here
Woah there!
not blank sheets!
calm down bro
brony i mean
03But here on campus there's nowhere else to recycle anything, so I throw it out. I'm not going to go out of my way to recycle my old homework assignments. The trees have already been killed, big dea.
03*deal;
U MAD BRO?
03and what I hate is "greenwashing"
O_o
03e.g. chopping giant holes out of DVD boxes with a recycle symbol
rofl
SCOOTALOO IS METAL
PIPEBOMB
say it with me now! you know what to do.
this reminds me of that spongebob ep with the paper he had to write
LOL
called it?
03I intentionally throw those out (worse for the environment ironically :P) and put those movies in PROPER cases that are actually DURABLE and don't have holes drilled in them
02Calling everyone a hippy because they’re environmentally friendly is irrelevant
GET ON WITH IT!!!
What's the matter, McFly.....Scootaloo
haha spongebob
03but I'm not going to around just wasting stuff for no reason
?
lol that episode of spongebob with the marching band
03I just don't have a problem *using* materials tha tI actually need
GET ON. WITH IT!
03I hate those "TURN YOUR COMPUTERS OFF AT NIGHT" people
SWEET VICTORY
Band Geeks
03I have legitimate reasons to leave my computer on, so stfu and stop nagging me
YES GET ON WITH IT!
Hahaha, that Spongebob.:D
the y should show us band geeks
Hm?
Okay, that might have worked, I dunno.
show the grand galloping collab XD
Old Spongebob is good new is bad
THE GRAND GALLOPING COLLAB XD
curse you THE, curse you to tartarus!
Now thats good stuff.
Can you read what I'm saying, or is my irc not working?
03they're going to do it either way
03most people don't buy recycled paper
sleeps
I can
show pony parodies
03so it's fairly irrelevant
Yes
Lol spongebob
Thank you, Dken2021 and ponies47
11,01BLANKITY BLANKITY BLANK!
I'm alive!
Not a ghost.
02they make it, and a lot of paper is recycled without notice

Guess what! I'm currently writing my own fanfic.
Twilight should do what i saw in a dif show: "This is my essay of 900 words. However, after that last sentence, I only have 893 words left. But after that last sentence i now have even less words to write..."
02only like 25% of it isn't
later
ohai everypony
lol
03I don't like recycled paper, it feels cheap and flimsy compared to the fresh stuff
CCCP: Hi thar.
hey CCCP!
03but that's just personal preference :P
bye TheHoodyMaid
Dashie20Percent: Hell yeah, I'm trying that myself.
CCCP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lali-ho CCCP!!
FaithHeart:what's up!!!!!!!!
I LOVE YOU are the three words lol
hi PonySwagg
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
hi MahBoi777
HEY CCCP!
03my point being, not recycling paper is nowhere near as bad as throwing out plastic
CCCP: привет!
hi Azureflames66
HI EpicPwnTime!
Anyone else feels this sad emptyness ever since season 2 ended?
/me gives CCCP some PONIES :D
03That's what's actually bad for the environment as it doesn't NATURALLY DECOMPOSE like paper does
this is reminiscant of that one spongebob ep
YES!
I'm doing good. How are you?
Depends on the type of plastic
i do:(:'(
of course kenne i think he referenced it on purpose
hi Dken2021 and ponies47 and twilight_sprinkle and Gunthler
twilight_sprinkle ONLY to find herself in a procastination problem......
hey evrypony
twilight_sprinkle: what does that mean?
03Also, I hate that "You're a citizen, BE GREEN" attitude that government has,they really need to go after COMPANIES - look at things like video game controllers and accessories, those things come in plastic wrapping inside stupidly large plastic containers that just waste a crap ton of resources
hi everyone that just came in
CCCP: it means go to hell
lali-ho imjustaderper
Gunthler why thank you :)
imjustaderper: ponies :d
03so how can you expect me to not throw stuff like that out when I have no choice >_>
twilight_sprinkle It would be funny as hell
twilight_sprinkle: awww thanks :)
Gunthler: cha
hey imjustaderper
CCCP: well actually it means "hi"
Oh, I gotta go. Gotta go practice my sonic rainboom for the WonderBolts tour next week. Bye, everypony!

Dashie20Percent: XD bye!
03I like Amazon frustration-free packaging

i want to draw pictures of ponies
Yeah, but a good one.
hi imjustaderper
I got a record to hold onto

02Like, why would someone want to trash their wii box. What if you sell it one day?
Azureflames66: /)
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
PonySwagg: Which one is it now?
03That's made of cardboard.
03I'm not talking about the system
03I said accessories
which fanfic?
Absuuuuurd?
The reader of these fics is just brilliant.
CCCP /)
03I remember when Wii points cards would come wrapped in plastic
03It's a fricking sheet of paper with a code. Why do you need to wrap it in plastic?
And in 5 weeks Game Of Thrones is over
Oh, gawd
03and if you actually save that plastic container you're a bit of an idiot
Picky and Spike!
can we make requests for which fanfics we can read?
i am still learning how tos draw da main body of ponies tho : /
02well, I'm not talking about things like that
pikorar: That would be Scoot-Scootaloo reading :d
03I am
ok i admit it 4chan, i love you please lift my ban :(
Can you read my fanfic.. that is when I'm finished?
I got a great one
03I don't mind cardboard boxes as >Paper is recyclable
03we've been over this
Gunthler: He is a mastermind.
CCCP how'd you get ban'd?
flutter_spin: can i read it?
CCCP: Read what?
Yeh, the amazon packaging is far better
i had an idea for a fanfic, idk if it will be great
CCCP GOT BANNED!?
nope. No cupcakes
Fail reading Scoot-Scootaloo. Go back to English now!:D - Your 8th Grade English Teacher
Not on my watch!
All the crap plastic packaging needs to be scrapped asap
^^ You can read it after I'm finished. I'm going through step 4 of my 5 steps
03every time I buy flash drives and memory cards and they come in stupid plastic packaging
03what do you want me to do >_>
flutter_spin: May I?
03you can't recycle it, at least not around here
Dken2021: they can ban you for fun you know /b/ has pretty much no rules that applies to mods too
03so that's what I mean
03it'snot *my* fauly
03t
pikorar: from 4chan
03at the same time, drill holes in my DVD boxes and they WILL sit in a landfill, I guarantee it >:P
It is there, but I GOTTA edit it. There are a ton of problems with the story
PonySwagg: oops tab fail?
CCCP: Oh, everyone gets banned from 4chan one time or another.
True
Meh@physical media
:/
02I agree with you there
03I agree when it comes to video games
they banned you for lulz?
pikorar: but mine is a ban that will never go away
03I prefer downloads to discs
00,03frayed knot
I'm also hoping someone will draw a picture for it.... Wrek maybe?
Dken2021: yup
Ok....this is supossed to be My Little Ponies' Ponies, right? I can't find it anywhere....
03but for things like movies, it's nice to have an actual collection
03just to show. xD
CCCP: What did you do?
lol
03and the thing is
hi imjustaderper
03it's not wasteful unless you throw it out
Dark92Enigma: I LOOOOOOOVE ponies
One of the problems is DRM crap on legal video
03if I actually buy movies and KEEP THEM, it's not hurting anybody
Ohaithar
Hello, everypony!
hi
03well
hey Calcos323
pikorar: nothing they just abnned me for fun
02see, that's how I am with video games. I like to have an actual collection
Hi Calcos323! I love you!
banned*
lali-ho Calcos323
it is about 14,000 words long right now
calcos323: cheeky
03Copy protection on DVDs and even BLu-Rays is at least less annoying than DRM
hi Calcos323!!!!!! *hugs*
I love you too pikorar
03as it's actually removable
Steam is my collection
HUGZ
CCCP: For fun? 4chan... Banned your for fun... Seems legit?

Scoot-Scootaloo breaking news
Calcos323: Hello new person I've never met before

PonySwagg, I'm a semi-regular here, you'll see me more often
you know what?
buck it
Gunthler: Yeah, after my "story reading"...sure....*pomf*
im drawing on comp paper
03basically the same idea as Steam but for the Xbox
02well, I always know what I will want to play on a trip, etc XD
im so bored!
03why not have your entire library with you wherever you are?
so very very bo-ooooooooored!
So much tch

I want some more fallout :3
i want to write a fan fic where Pinkie Pie joins the red army
I think it would be cool if someone will volunteer to draw my OC :P
Pinkie Pie = Lyra
GIR YOU NEED SOME FUN! Unfortunately, 4chan will ban you for that.
03as far as stuff like the DS goes, get a flash cart and fill it with ROMs. Problem solved
03you save money that way too :P
Sticks and stones can break your bones......but first ya gotta throw 'em!!!
What fic is he reading?

03I used to like owning DS games too
I have really poured my heart into my fanfic
omg hi Alister!!!!!! :D :D :D
02oh, so you're saying game artist and developers aren’t making loads of money?
03but I've since sold or donated all of mine and I just use the AceKard
03They aren't
flutter_spin: whats it about?
03Nintendo is
03not the people who make the game
02they are
flutter_spin: bashes head through desk
03not really.
Who's a-streamin?
03Not from direct game purchases at least
Me
Its about uh.. its about finding more about a mysterious voice
No, really? :D
cutenesskitteh: you are
Anyone want so hear the best singing ever?
no
meh
Oh hay
03and if you care that much, why not just write the developers a check for $30, then download the ROM - that way you save resources and so on and so forth being green yadda yadda
The plot revolves around the mystery. I don't want to spoil it
cutenesskitteh: jk
twilight's a book nerd
03|:P
03-|
varying degrees of meh
Lookit cute Scoot in cute outfit
I am listening to I am the walrus, I am hearing the best singing ever
02The people who make the game make an average of about $80,00o/year
02And yes, I did my research as I’ve been thinking about going that route
flutter_spin: i cant wait to read it when u finish it can u link it?
the correct word is egghead Dken2021
Biglaw: koo koo catchoo
02$80,000*
i rather sugar coat a leprechaun, feed him to a dog and then go plau some croquet!
