I have to say, RD's reasoning was kind of weak. Just sayin'
RD isn't really known for brain power though is she.
Why not?
Burn marks over 95% of his body!
Because she's kinda dense.
Well, how does she know that the birds and bat all saw her get trapped and left her anyway
Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's Maybelline.
Rarity is ADORABLE
The fact that there was an avolanche, they were suddenly in the lead, and she wasn't castching up.
now this is...
Oh, and that she was calling after theme.
this is the dress one
whats it called?
She's also kind of a sore loser.
05,15kind of?
05,15KIND OF?
I wanted to sound nice.
Yes, but that doesn't matter in this episode.
05,15No RD deserves NOTHING!
I lost my dental license to that toy
not even hero for a day?
It's not mix and match.
my computer hates me today
Also, who's to say she couldn't have more then one pet?
Dken, +1
She'll be a crazy cat lady!
05,15Are we aruguin in here again?
No.
Maybe
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
To correct me I'd have to be wrong.
Exactly
It's not laging for me, not much atleast
Thus, you are.
And I'm not.
05,15eh it's fine if you do. just keep it civil and all that
There's a difference between discussing/debating and arguing
0,5This is a nice room
Don't you think that's a problem?
Something about ponies happened
That I know
Those kinda mods are afraid of people getting their feelings hurt.
Or afraid that it doesn't look like they're doing their job.
http://derpy.me/WcHaI i post this during a rarity ep
/me lairjack face.
My alsmost avourite song
/me liarjack*
almost*
I really like this song
I don't subscribe to the "I'm right because you're and idiot" school of thought.
I do however advocate the "you're wrong because you're and idiot" one.
an*
been working for about 16 hoursso far
I try to explain to the idiots what's wrong with there arguement
Well, I don't like using that argument, but when that's all the discussion is, it needs to stop
faces
all of them confuse
and now they all have cat hair on them
Yes it si
Lett talk about last night until I can remember it ok?
*Let's not
You don't remember the epic bar brawl we had?
120%*
AS I was bringing up proof that you were wrong.
Despite the fact that my previous point was the "backup"
Oh look more arguements
You can't prove me wrong in this instance.
/me hits panic button
Yes I can.
There realistically isn't enough evidence to figure out RD's reasoning.
You can only fill in the blanks.
Dr. Drill and Fill is a terrible dentist
rumor spred by dogs
There is enough.
You can't prove me wrong anymore than you can prove yourself right.
as The..*
dat base
05,15just out of curiosity what's this debate about?
RD's decision to choose the Tortoise.
the twilight room is split betwene wugglepets hate, wugglepets disinterest and a discusision about transformers
!cd
:3
That Rainbow Dash had a good reason to choose the Tortoise over the others because the ohters left her after the rockfall and didn't bother to turn around.
They were all to focused on winning and getting to be her pet.
05,15that's her reasoning
Fluttershy is a choosy jerk
poor fluttershy
and now poor rarity
huh. the nvidia sticked just came off my laptop
this plays every time i'm coding
only took it 3 years
Hilarious.
Play me at chess some time.
She's talking about us!
It'd be more interesting.
Nothing, but I like chess.
And?
No it isn't.
Chess is boring
am i allowed to cry during ponies?
Checkers is for REAL MEN
tic-tac-toe
you sank my rook
Chess requires lots of practice and the ability to think on multiple things at one time. I don't have that ability
Anyone Knows "What's the Title of this Book?" or "The Lady or the Tiger?"
I haven't even seen a chess board in over a year.
or maybe even "The Chess mystries of Sherlock Holmes/The Arabian Knights"?
I have a chessboard made of marble, it's gorgeous.
And?
and nothing, it seemed relevant to the conversation.
It isn't really.
Kinda just bragging
The conversation is now about chess, explain how it isn't relevant.
I cried for a week at how terrible it was
No one reads Raymond SMullyan I guess
lol, the spam is still going
/me rubs forehead.
and then the day comes and BOOM Chess set
nah
That's more like a piece of the conversation as a whole
^
Depends, can I got nappy?
tired'
No this is the world.
05,15Davie_Jones you need a nap
Time to get breakfast
I'll be back maybe around 9:30ish at latest
*naps as well*
I told a story of how I hate chess and nopony listend
that's about it
I was playing chess the other day :P
Soreness/Dryness, either one*
ots 00:52 here
You cried because you got a glass chess set.
I can read that you sold it for $8 but that it is.
That's...you know I can see why people ignored it.

seems legit
And I was 8

that's because talking in ryme is boss
I don't give a shit anymore.
excuse my spelling
Again, I'm just going with my headcanon here
See, I could go all day with this until you agree that it isn't aninomorphic.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
Then why doesn't it use a word for color?
or coat?
>YFW the Challenger exploded
Adn he got a shelf for that?
Three years later though.
And I don't think that the writers would just pull a random word out of a medical dictionary
Luna won't you cry for me

Fuck it.

feeaaat
A word for the bowl taht catches BLOOD
Well, I don't think that they would choose that word without a reason
Tabitha's awesome as this voice.
Yes.. but a bowl for catching BLOOD
that bowl is soo metal
You really think they'd make that mistake?
And? It's still a bowl
I wish Rarity was in the episode too. but I appreciate the theory that Rarity is exhausted.
Exactly.
Which is the probable point of the Hairy Potter joke.
They wouldn't have called it that without a reason
rarity scene?
how bout "amniamorphic", a fic i read had that spelling
How AWESOME would that be?
*amnia-
"Amiina (formerly Amína and Aníma) is an Icelandic musical quartet"
i assume thats not it

Pinkie Pie was a bitch this episode
Afaik that's her only name.

I'm summoning the spiders. They'll come at my call!
Spiderses
I'm gong to stop watching now
Because I'm spidermare!
Kil the Loyalists!
/me kills the loyalists
Because total mayhem and destruction is worth a good laugh
That shouting...it's making people nervous.
WORSHIP HER!
Also breaking the goddess of the night
I would worship her
omg, cliffhanger
/me stops killing Loyalists.
0,5IKR
I don't think she'd want you worshiping her after you wet yourself from fear.
/me uses magic to revive ALL THE LOYALISTS!
No srsly, Pinkie kept going even AFTER Twilight asked her to stop
And RD decided to SCREW EVERYTHING UP
has anyone here read the rd travels through time fic?
ep20 is gonna be epic
it was a mindfuck
RD screwing things up? nah.
Ep20 is going to up the flood gates for fannon and cannon.
Or Emmet Frown...
Brown*
ponies=MANLY
Though, the one thing I would die to see is a River Song pony. Spoilers
well for you, no more talk about it then
/me is gonna watch the episode then leave when it is done.
Link the synopsis either privately or at a time when outside links are acceptable.
River Sogn pony? NO THANK YOU

*checks wiki*
<Stewie head tilt>
05,15I'm too scared to ask for the pony toys at mcdonalds
Shipping pic? XD
cherilee I guess
It's McDonalds. They're used to weirdos.
I'm too scared to eat at McDonalds
nooooo
i missed it
I am not ashamed to go to mcdonalds and ask por ponies
:(
I where my pony shirts abnd hoodie with pride
awesome painting :)
I HOPE WE- screw it.
I get a few stares, but most people ignore it.
> Not using FB2K
07,01Wrek check PM's
Thats a lot of pony music
05,15I'll wear a shirt, or use a pony bag, but I just can't bring myself to ask for the toys
0,14I'd be the same way
0,14but
I'm lying, things like that only happen in America.
0,14since the toys are coming out in march
well by guys
Just bring ut up casually, like "Oh, by the way do you have the pony toys?"
0,14I think I'll try to get the Twilight toy for my birthday
derp?
I need to complete my mane 6 collection yet
That's how I'd roll.
0,14^
0,14essentially, the plan for my b-day is
I wore my shirt all the way through the gymnasium I'm going to attend.
Felt good.
They usually sell the toys by themselves for like, a quid if you ask.
The day derpy became canon I went Wal-mart and bought the Blin Basg mane 6 toys not one fuck was givin
Listening to music like this makes me wanna listen to more Two-Mix.
gawd my typing is crap 2day
0,14run around the house like a giddy child
*brohoof* :D
I don't run into Two-Mix fans like, ever, lol
0,14Indeed
lol
Early 90's Japanese music scene ftw
0,14It helps that I don't quite look 20 XD
Play "Running in the 90s" :p
I got mc'ds toys and a rainbow dash currently
05,15nope
Well that sucks.
Europet mix please :)
This isn't an open request radio stream...
05,15Well actually, we do have blood sasuage, but it's expensive and rare
although this one is pretty epic too
^
0,14It's delicious though
00,03Naptime for me! See you guys in a few hours!
oh

Het eman
heey*
http://imgur.com/afxiG
Ponies are actually really easy to draw, and fun too :D
ARGH!?
helo world
I overslept
You missed it.
You missed it hard.
Everything.
oh my D:
Maybe, but I can't draw worth crap
The mareathon, the episode, whatever else there was.
You missed it all.
0,14Adobe Illustrator, I think
00,10Dontforget no spoilers alowed here till one day after the ep
it's AI
^
wut
Oh, shipping
Muted?
Mhhm, gotta wait 24 hours :)
the fuck
I really DO like this latest episode.
0,14^
and thus I'm GLAD I watched the leaked ep!
maybe I need to reduce my sensitivity when I try to draw on my computer
bc I had a feeling this would happen
You missed like Zatoichi playing snooker.
00,10emangamer he's using a tablet
Same eman... same here
But I was on a roll :(
00,10he uses mouse for vectors but tablet for sketching
:'(
Doesn't one draw out the 3D form first, then add lower-level detail?
lol
:P
Yes
Well, you missed, is the basic underlying point of that.
I want one know....they look epic
I need one.... ...
remixes
Wow, that is a great expression.
I find it easier just to draw on paper then scan for sadly I dont have tablet
Awww that drawing.
dwwwwwwaaaaa
:)
give him a mullet
if you lack a tablet, scanners are always good :P
There are some cheap but well worth it tablets
lol for face
Geez...so jelly of these skills....
Seeya for eurostream everypony.
Bamboo from Wacom are good starter tablets
Cheerliee looks like the pony in control here XD
Yeah, I hear about Wacom a lot from artists.
Trust makes some nice ones too
"McFly you Bojo! Those boards don't work on water!" "Uless you've got POWAH!"
00,10some tablets are just touch pads some are more of a screen that you draw on.
Just because hes built like a brick shithouse :@

There's a difference between being shy and not being assertive.

I'm off everypony. Keep it real..^.^
Later tater.

Hope you all enjoyed/enjoy the episode! I thought it was excellent.
Have fun@
when did the episode air?
and now she's REALLY close
dang I wanted to see peoples reaction to jelly
Like,
earlier it airewd
UGH I've about had it with these namby pamby stories

Wasn't it called Battle Clouds?
It wasn't named, I think.
If only to embarress her
But it's as good a name as any, for sure.
wait, 4 joints on the leg? Does it work like that in the show, i havent noticed
stream isn't working for me - i think the wrong stream is on the website
Although I do hope to find my destined Kismesis someday.
oh right, she said "You've rained on my cloud" and such during playing it
Yeah, no offense, but that leg looks....strange
Seemed like it wasn't exactly battle ships
I find that that is the hardest part to draw
I dont mean to be critical
I've been single for nearly 28 years (as in, my whole life). beat that!
sad, I know
HA! i'm 34! got you beat by 6 years!
fortunattly I can't beat that
d'aww
wow....this argument is making me sad
yes oh lordy
My work here is done then. *dusts off hooves*
Single for longer than i have graced this earth, :(
wow suddenly I feel like a kid lol
haha! Ive not loved for longer! I WIN
wait.....
This arguement is kind of stupid
um
Ahem. I said... *Dusts off hooves*
it was EXACTLY like the setup for Battleships
Hmm
05,15Lucid the only real answer is to stay single
Yeah, but with other pieces, like not ships I guess
I have little interest in getting a girlfriend. Everybody at work jokes about it.
Same concept and rules I suppose
Alright then, sorry to bring it up then
exactlly
oh
you just havent found that someone,, i know that feel all to well

Well, I'm going to see it, cause explosions
you're welcome :-)
In other movie news, I am pretty damn excited for Act of Valor
Harumph!
note book?
id imagine you would need some things to disagree apon, Its healthy to argue and debate :p
hidsight is 20/20
one good thing did come out of this episode. I like cherelee a lot more now
Oh, this is inkscape? Interesting. I thought InkScape was purely for "vectoring."
you can still practice with paper
05no this is still illustrator
Yeah. sadly it's not...
The lasso tool looked too familiar. =P
Sure. Go right ahead. :)
but come ON!
Of course, I'm also a naval geek

Yeah, acts of valor looks good.
no, I was wondering if Inkscape is a good tool for beginning drawers

05,15EXPLOSIONS
it's the hard on Bay has for the US military
05,15BOOM
05,15BANG
k, back.
05,15HOT CHICK
05,15that's what's wrong with it
/me is depressed
and the fact that you don't even SEE the Transformers that much
08,01does... does this mean i'm cute now?
the TRANSFORMERS take a back seat in a MOVIE abotu THE TRANSFORMERS
/me head asplodes
^
lol
08,01EVENING EVERYPONY! \o/
I mean, I get that it's a toy commercial.
Good Evening :)
good evenin
I only truly hated Transformers 2.
hello Saturn
evening Saturn
but I've got to go everypony :(...see you all later
besides ofc the debacle that was 3's plot
/me hugs #bronystate
seeya eman
...and Meagan Fox doesn't do it for me, tbh.
My rating is..
but for a movie called Transformers, you don't see them that much
plues
Erm
Drawing is one of my three passions
I've changed it 4 times since last saturday
http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz5rnpIMHU1r3shcio1_500.jpg
It is harder than I expected
08,01http://imgur.com/axskU
or how about the railgun
Exactly.
No, but it is me :p
dat meh
that is NEVER mentioned or used again
Transformers is made to sell toys.
dat homer in the background
that would have been DAMN USEFUL
05,15all I can look at is the screaming homer
Would've gave it a 9/10 but I was alone while watching.
I forgot to put money in the eletrickery meter, and the power went out
And now the broadcast is offline :(
I'm not expecting shakespeare, I GET that!
http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/s720x720/426391_2821160333475_1392930293_32534012_1394409739_n.jpg
Actually, a comic spoofing the Zero Wing intro with the cast replaced with ponies would actually be pretty awesome...
08,01does drinking from a juicebox make me cuter? http://imgur.com/axskU
20% cuter
Meh is not a proper reaction to romance.
Saturn: ...sorta
Saturn: no, you are not a fluttershy
Thats it back now :p
08,01emangamer: how do you know i'm not a fluttershy wearing a saturn suit?
actually, it's not canon either
Saturn: No, but that is an epic painting in the background.
is issistrator vastly superior to Photoshop?
and ofc the sweeping shots of the US military in action
I guess I liked Transformers 1 because I was expecting something abysmal and instead I got a watchable movie.
welcome back
Saturn: O.o touche
or for that matter
I to would like to know
Because photoshop is annoying me lately
That's crazy talk... you're crazy...
but that's me
*its drawing
a large heart* even
you know what's a good movie with explosions?
^
meh
Transformers 3 was vexing.
you all should have seen that
No stream? ;w;
But man, Transformers 3 with Rifftrax was hilarious.
Malkovich stole the show
/me sways lighter back and forth "WOOOOOOO"
I approve of this music
i g2g night :)
really, the biggest thing in this ep for me...Death is now Canon.
I never saw that one
but hay
Yup
(\
the A Team movie was pretty good too
*brohoof*
also, Religion of some sort is now canon.
Never saw. I've never seen a full episode of the A-Team, even.
me neither
and he's to obssessed with loads of jelly!
i never realized how easy it was to color like this
do I didn't have anything to base it against
Or are you applying lighting?
where on earth did that even come from
as a cold watching I liked it
You mean everypony dosen't worship Celestia?
Luna ftw!
05,15Warhammer 40K
I wouldn't really call Celestia and Luna gods
I mean, imagine if WE could do that?
I'M SORRY!
Celestia and Luna aren't gods
then their would be choas
Still need back story
:3
They are princesses
but.. they LITERALLY make the Sun and the Moon rise and set each day... :/
it's all this exposure to Ponyium
Maybe a higher power gave them the power to?
It's okay
We're okay
*phew*
yes he does
and as such we're jelly
I really like how the drawing is coming out
yes, or Lucy Screw
Yeah, no more Bayformers.
What's a bayformer?
Can anyone give me a hand, It is telling me the stream is offline, ive refreshed many times, and its apparent its still going
thy logging out and back on
try I mean
In during ticker.
I find the Navy eternally fascinating, all the same.
how old is granny smith? watch winter wrap up then watch family appreciation day. she's hundreds of years old!!
season 2 finale / season 3 opener perhaps?
kk
Something like that isn't just gonna happen in the middle of an episode that isn't focused on it.
I keep refreshing and the broadcast is offline ;o;
Though I despair at the political implications of 11 Carrier Groups.
England has the most after us, with 3. And we're allies.
It's only going to be 10 for a while.
Bai Everypony <3
Later
you forgot the Cheerilee's tail
or, 2 of the CMC get theirs, and ther 3rd starts to feel left out.
why did i put "the" in there?
Illustrator
05http://i.imgur.com/zutGw.png for those that want it
The problem with "Battleship" is that it's public domain.
you forgot her tail
hey everypony
0,14aaaaaand favorited
its nice
this drawing is making me feel self consious
yep, main stream is over until 2 when movie stream starts again.
That was awesome
Best. Episode. Ever.
Don't forget Derpy, Derpy can go back in time too.
RARITY! ;)
OK Go ponies?
hmm, right
My handwriting is worst handwriting
in a pub
Hmm, Luna maybe?
How my teachers were able to discipher mine is beyond me
For instance, we had to wait 3 weeks between ROH 2 and Lesson Zero
Rainbow Dash. I can tell from the smirk.
They should just air an episode every other week. Then we'd have year round ponies.
wait wuts he drawing?
05,15brb everypony
Bye Dr. Nick.
the one I watched it on died =(
yep, worst one was between Hearths Warming Eve & Family Appreciation Day
pony on a pole...right
N/m
pole dancing pony?
is he drawing fleur poledancing???
^^This
walking stick...
Either way, I think I like where this is going
This riff reminds me of U2, honestly.
vine...
Pole dancing is good cardio.
"U Jelly"
which ep, Count?
rainbow with a guitar?
I have 2 eps that I dislike, but even then there are parts of each that I still enjoyed.
so...another 2 hours then....DRAT
the idea of taking ancestral ground in exchange for apple pies? ...wut?
I have yet not to like an episode.
hey. this bargain rite-aid cola is actually pretty good... :/
I suddenly thought of horizons seeing deus
Name of caracter
lol
Of course, at this point, I would watch just about anything
0,14we need a Gaijin 4koma using this: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2735/
ya that episode was disapointing
0,14looooooved that scene
Yeah, I wasn't all that impressed with Mare-do-well.
Why arent you showing the mare-a-thon?
watching these have helped me improve, got the basic shape for ponies down. my sketches are getting closer to looking like the thing I intended
0,5Deus the mare-a-thon is over
because Deus, the mare-a-thon is already over
wait
then...what about the latest episode?
0,5It ended a half hour ago
also over
Deus: It came on at 6:00 AM EST. Don't ask why.
:(
but
but
0,5Time zones, my friend
0,5Infamous time zones
the...countdown
I KNOW that
I was FINE with RD's attitude in Mare-Do-Well. It was the OTHER members of the Mane 6 that were my problem.
That drawing! I'm dying to know how it'll look like in the end!
looks kinda Mass Effect-like
NOT the latest ep.
lord. yes
i missed the first half og the ep because of it
a bugger it
05might continue a bit on this one
and !cd doesnt work in main room
I'd watch that
I don't know what's going on in this picture, but I like it
05meh fuck this
Yeah, the plot of that episode felt very contrived
stream went away
05goan do this
?
05johntb.deviantart.com
05nope
then, get rid of the scene where the Mane 6 are talking up mare-do-well, and instead put in a scene where they try to talk to RD about being full of herself.
It's not like it was really hurting anyponty
0,14...
DOO EET
0,14oh boy
why do i have a VEEMI stream that dont work?
My friend played this. IMO, it looks too much like an FPS and not and RPG. :\
0,5Stream is on replay I thought
0,5BEcause I saw that other girl thing from earlier
Giggle at the Ghosties....its not very effective..
Cut off their limbs!!!
there, you have a believeable, relateable story where the characters aren't immediately and unwarrantedly jumping into hijinks.
Wait, crap.
necromorph ponies would be scary... >.>
right! I think I hear my fanfiction calling. "Count, work on me! I yearn to be completed!" gotta run, seeya everypony and thanks again for the stream! ya'll are the best!
0,14O_O
that one got me :)
Oh my gooooooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That wasn't scary at all *shivers in the corner*
I heard they were making one

Another movie that I really want to see is a Halo movie.

Stoopid zombies, get off my lawn
OK, guys, I'm gonna go on now and try to do something productive of my own. (in b4 Skyrim)
