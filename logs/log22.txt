Hmm, maybe
updates aren't always about power
I personaly know nothing about C# though
Yeah, but you would have though they wouldn't have made it worse in terms of power.
not necessarily
they may have had to sacrafice power for efficiency or speed
They could have just created the language for the user-friendliness
yeah
like Python
hmm
Python is sloow
You like my name
?
but easy to learn
:D?
XD
Haha, yeah
xD
but it was hard getting used to
I agree with Sneas
XD
no clue here
I personally didn't really see the point of it
but again
probably just brainwashed by java or something
C# has a runtime

that's quite the achievement

I'm about to go x_x

/me hugs LLOTS
It seems to generate 'bitcoins' for him or something.
/me hugs back :(
because halfway through she still thought I was kidding
hmm
What's a bitcoin?
but then she got all interested in it
XD
No idea.
hm
http://www.bitcoinplus.com/generate
?
>:L
and it's really slowing it down
you wanted me earlier?
Yeah, I was busy drawing Hitmonlee. xD
haha
I thought it might be slow...
Mhm. I assume you're aware of this? http://www.roleplaygateway.com/pokemon-the-dawning-darkness-kurokari-pokemon-t53977.html
hmm
in fact I am not
How bad is it?
CPU usage of java is 90% on my computer.
took about 5 minutes to close it
These are fan-made sketches, of course, but some are frigging amazing.
OK i removed the stuff./
oh wow
they are
:P
Ha, that made me laugh too.
http://www.bitcoinplus.com/howbitcoinworks
7$ per bitcoin.
Meh.
Yep.
lol
maybe I read it wrong, but...
what's this update
SR is updating SF
How?
our computers were trying to "solve the puzzle" or whatever
but if we're making it where does it go?
No idea
it doesn't know my bank account
weird
Why would he force all users to take part in something that doesn't benefit him?
12*articuno
I... don't know
I'm fairly sure it either gives him the bitcoins or splits them.
SR is in ur bank account, usin ur bitcoinz
reading through that page I mean
"You can use as many computers as you like, all signed in to the same account, in order to generate bitcoin faster. "
12o-o
How can you make bitcoins if you don't have an account?
Does he expect everyone to have an entire computer lab running at once?
12LugiaLordOfTheSeas~~
makes everyone who's on the site automatically be signed in to his account
therefore generating a ton of money
That would have to be it.
That's really dishonest if you ask me
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
That has to be a lie.
that or he implemented it poorly
XD
Lies
Well either way - it was about money.
We don't really get it either
yeah, that's all we know
Nothing really added to the site.
we're trying to figure out the rest
Apparently whatever SR did was giving him or us some kind of virtual curency
*currency
:P
...We established this a long time ago. You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?
No...?
Why should I have been?
Forums aren't real time enough, I was thinking you should have a forum where each thread is real time.
No reason, I'm just surprised.
I'd never heard of bitcoin
^
Same.
Never had any real use for it.
*it
He's been in on the blackmarket
Oh? Lol.
:P
Hahaha.
Let's just say some of his methods of making money haven't been exactly legal or ethical
Or sane.
Umbreon~~

patronizing?
12i hate combat
12i always die too easy
Apart from Refining, Blacksmithing
I didn't think you patronized us
12only thing i'm good at
"You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?"
12meh
12even all the masteries?

and yeah

Since when were they skills?
12since i am my old normal self and just like to be annoying
I was kind of exaggerating. But it didn't sit right with me after I said it. Anyway, hopefully I'll have Hitmonlee up by tomorrow.

I prefer something more like... Ash

it's a Western crossed with a sci-fi

Actually I remember a sci-fi/western film.

Oh, never mind then. XD

03they advertised being able to cut a penny in half
nice
03but I basically hurt my hand because a hard drive is a little bigger than a penny LOL
03meaning it needs a lot more force
me and a friend once took a sledgehammer to a hard drive
well it was a maul, sledgehammer-axe thing
we beat the scheisse out of that thing with the axe side and we barely managed to puncture a hole in the disk
03yeah
03that was the same way
03we barely put a dent in it
(:
it was 20GB
03I wish I had an axe XD
from 2000
03this was 2003
03the drive I just dejstroyed was early 2008
03and as far as i know, 500GB is the biggest IDE drives that have ever been made
we also did that to a couple old motherboards
03LOL
they both didn't work
at all
i think he also said it made a popping noise
before aforementioned smoking

03ohnoez.

I tend to sleep a bit during the day.
Physics.
you must be getting close to done, eh?
D:
really?
wow
I've never even had close to that many classes at once
I suppose the school system is just different over here.
yeah, probably
I had 9 (one of which was lunch)
only having three or four classes per day
for her it's natural
Yeah.
how many per day do you have over there?
It used to be 8, but they changed it to 4 that are twice as long.
Well, on the outskirts but technically still part of it.
and you go to that town's school I imagine?
we don't have them, but I know of them
:P
Haha
XD
I still want to go there
not necesarily live there
Mainly.
yeah, I can imagine
XD
everyone'd know me as the american with the slightly canadian accent
Hah, my sister had the misfortune of having to go to a pretty bad school, she was really unhappy there. Goes to a different place now though (although she'll be leaving for university soon).
Yeah.
Just turned 18.
for some reason I always imagined her being younger when you mention her
Hahaha
:P
Lol, maybe.
the one from earlier?
Go go power rangers!
Yeah.
the anthology one?
Yep.
I think it's a compilation of loads of videos.
Made by different people.
those can be good sometimes

But never posts in them
most of them are old
03it's good if you like spamming
planted before or around when that little "raid' junk happened
No, I mean recent ones
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4918.html
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4914.html
well that's not surprising either
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4892.html
I think it's Ziamber doing it
one user shouldn't be allowed to create multiple accounts from the same IP
according to SR
I don't know how they're even being activated
6Still?
6What's she up to now?
12Yes, in this way that you can't get her on
Ziamber has posted from more than one IP
But it doesn't really matter
well I'll have to ask SR about it
As long as they're not posting
well if he's going to keep pulling this crap from account to account I just want to get rid of them all together
I don't know it's him for sure, but it seems like it is
6Someone needs to tell her that not everyone can respond to her in 5 seconds. Ovo
o.o
yeah I know
I'll ask SR
and some of them mention "Mark" and he mentioned that name in some of his nonsense spam
K
even though I'll get the same answer
Half of them have the word "cripple"
wtf
I know it was just a joke
But you're probably right
:P
Ponies are the most anti-troll material ever.
Well he was just way too sensitive
And he flipped out about it
yeah But SR didn't exactly make any attempts to stop
hence why Kazoobie is gone now
oh I'm not saying SR was completely innocent
12It's people like her that made Arti take down the CBox in the first place
6Hmm.
I know
he was sensative yes
I don't use the forums much.
Just talk to you guys.
03again, it's not a CBox, it's a spambox.
Yeah I know
it's just a very trollable topic
I think it's the least trollable topic there is...
12Or a SBox drf XD
Well
But they won't get anywhere
Lolspam
Well I can't tell if anyone is talkng
Since the Cbox is borked
I didn't care if you guys were talking about ponies
you can talk about it as much as you want
I just don't like it when others try to push me to do something I haven't chosen to do myself, at least extensively :P
Yeah right, he didn't care. Haha.
Mhm
12But not over and over like Haii does
I didn't mean to push you to do anything, I was just talking about them, sorry.
no need to be sorry
that and after working 70 hours a week I can be in a very inpatient mood myself
either way it's all good
Heh

10I think this is her first day back
12Anyway, bbl
but he's posting from multipe IP's
you can only see their IP after they post

bananas would be a close second
Goodnight er'body!

but I'll stick with limes because they are good to have with certain foods
night patty
13I think rocks have boring lives
13especially because they don't live to begin with
Thanks, guys.
4what happned?
eons everywhere! *does a toy story meme stance*
if I was quartz I wouldn't mind
because at least people would look at me admiringly from time to time
13because that's the only feeling of non-existant happiness they'll ever feel
13because they are otherwise ignored by the rest of the world
13and they can't do anything about it
13because they're rocks
06>use millions of years to reach the beach
13Rock Pity
13;-;
06>cry
06But mostly
06yawn
13LOL
13but maybe that's a part of their happiness
13the excitement of washing up onto a beach and waiting for someone to throw them
13its like going down a slide
13you climb to the top, then slide down
13it makes sense :D
06a slide
06taking years to "climb"
06and seconds to slide down
06NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT
13But the enjoyment of sliding down is worth the wait :D
13because it's all they "live" for
13since they can't do anything else

/me is playing contra finally
lol
maybe they actually need to giver her more episodes to develop her character more?
4Yes
I didn't really like Rarity until she got a couple
4Yeah
4Same with me
4I mean, TWilight is just there to be...kinda there
yeah
it's impossible to have an episode without her in it
because she always has to do the moral thing at the end
4Ya
4Why don't we have her learn something...y'know...important
4Cuz there is such a thing of 'ACTUALLY HAVING WEAKNESS'
I can kinda see weakness in her
She's not very open minded for one thing

http://www.explosm.net/comics/1112/
Hahahaha.
for drf bashing AM broadcasting he is forgetting a key fact
and FM, when decoding uses a sortove AM decoding ?
AM noise is rejected
because it does not need much bandwidth
http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/129908301826.jpg
oh?
do you have a regular mono FM receiver and a sound card capable of 24 bit 192 KHz recording?
well, keep in mind, you can only see frequencies up to 96khz if you do a fft analysis
then he's boring to
my soundcard claims to do 24b: 192khz
go for it
but i herd realtek ones have a mediocre or bad snr
:P
(on board sound btw)
that might be a problem
if it claims 24 bit 192 KHz and is cheap it might be upsampling from 16 bit 48 KHz
HD RADIO FAIL
/me rolls
Rolls...What?
D-20
SA
well, when i record blanks, i see reflections beyond 24k, that may be either upscaling or aliasing, and some peaks from my soundcard
perhaps
have you taken a screen shot of it?
i'll do it now
http://imgur.com/a/uC0BF
looks like noise products to me
18k, fm carrier?
yea, i can see that in the second pix
just as I suspected earlier
wait a minute
I SEE IT!
look around 35 KHz
http://i.imgur.com/J5wkl.png @ 37, that might be a speech harmonic ?
also, do you see that second one at 57 KHz?
eh, well, i made a second recording, it goes up and down @ 38
not much at 57
goes up & down with music
57 KHz is the RDS subcarrier!
you captured both
congratulations
theory confirmed!
same or different FM station
same
interesting
yeaa, i think it's a fluke
might be
you never know
this is encouraging
I looked at the differences and maybe there is some truth
yep
it seems the random peaks change from recording to recording, since i did one earlier
that is quite a high noise floor
yea, mb a sucky soundcard & a sucky power system
visually I can't tell
'it just happens to. by coincidence.
they look IDENTICAL to the carriers I am looking for
yes.
the logo looks like a sideways figure 8 with RDS next to it
its about the easiest way to tell
nah
has a tape & cd player too
the sound card is highly suspect
everything's highly suspect.
the sound card most of all
my audio cable's like, 15ft long, and the power supply, too
03hm
03anyone know where I might find 3mm P1 Phillips screws?
03they're the kind mini-PCI express cards use
03I need a few
radioshack?
the long audio cable is the most suspicious
ideally you would use one shielded for RFI
and EMI
it runs right next to my TV cable, too

7How does Peyevil sound?
7O_o
7Well, differences in their vocabulary?
7English English, Nick.
7As in, from England.
lol difference in spelling does not warrant a totally different language
7It's more of the slang here and there.
7E.g, "robot" in South-African English refers to a traffic light.
7Hmm.
7So he is commenting on the differences in writing...

that reminds me
02Project café is comming in 2012 or 2013
02So you have time
but I've been wrong before :P
I'm saving for it now
I think that's just because "strife" is a synonym for "brawl"
02Kosovo

spending money basically
*so I can
but...I still gotta get brawl too >_>
03for several reasons
032. WTF paying $20 for Wii sports?
"Can't be hacked" LOL
03well
03you can do software hacking
03if you try to use a software loader
03I mean
03hacking aside
o.o
Wii sports costs money? O_o
I thought it was free, or it was when I got a wii ages ago.
03Yes it does
03hence
That's weird.
03also LOL GAMESTOP
03:)
I hope project cafe' is hackable and can run the same wii homebrew
:<
I don't really like the look of PS3 move or Xbox kinect though.
03EW PS3 MOVE
03Kinect is alright
03it's kinda silly but it works

Yeah.
If you turn it off it's likely to be at least slightly faster.
I don't know if it'd be noticeable though.
it is off

13ugh, those two goldfish we recently bought have some kind of parasite disease
13and it's probably gonna infect the whole tank soon
13=w=
13Just the thought of parasites in there makes me feel uncomfortable
where did you buy the fish from? O_o
that's odd
my dad's fiance had a fish tank and took care of a ton of fish in it for a long time, and even I have never seen any kind of parasite disease that infects the whole tank

Hey guys
Why is there reason to?
8Fucking colors, how do they work?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
4There
Colours, they work sort of like this. (:
8Nope.avi
8Awesome
warn*
8Also, did you see DCD's post?
Well I offered to make a script that warns then kicks people for using colours.
Don't know if he wants me to though.
8he might be coming into the room shortly
8*shrug*
8afk i assume
He was here a couple of minutes ago.
4Probably
Because I showed him my awesome rainbow ponychan theme: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/rainbows-lots.jpg
Humm
XD
8I agree about all of those things, pretty much in that order too
8let's make that the agenda
4Good, because I was getting a little worried last night
13Hai
13=D
Hey.
4Okay
Awesome.
8so thats one less thing to worry about
4*Or
4Alright
8I agree
4Hell, we could demote him to just a regular user for all I care (and I'm leaning more towards this anyways)
8I think he should be at least bumped down to half-ops
8it was very unprofessional of him to not show up at all and not tell us he would be gone
4posting on Ponychan, I mean
8me too
13:(
13This time I SHOULD be good.
8it's a completely different situation
8you participated in our mod meetings, informed us ahead of time and came for at least part of the pre-show
8Lou basically ignored us completely
8he hasn't even posted in the mod discussion thread
12Hey, I'm here.
12Sorry, I was busy posting.
4Lou, on the other hand, has done none of those things
4ever, I don't think
12I haven't seen him AT ALL since the first streaming.
12Honestly, I haven't even considered him a mod at all recently.
8yeah
4Neither have I
hay guize watsup
8I would actually lean towards stripping him all together
8altogether*
8it might seem a little harsh, but he clearly is not investing his time in this like the rest of us
8i would be ok with that
4Yeah, that was gonna be my suggestion
cocks
:o
4Fine, we'll bump him down to half-op BUT if he doesn't show up at all this week then he's demoted to regular user next week

i have work to do
is there any way i can like
4Yeah
8and we DEFINITELY need to get more half-ops now
13*forgets the whole conversation*
4Has anyone seen anyone during the streams that they think would be eligible for half-ops?
8me too
13Goodnight all :3
8I wouldn't say anyone has stood out a TON
8closest I can think of would probably be SirChuckles (I think that was his name)
4I have three candidates, but like you guys have said they haven't really stood out much
8who are they?
/whois Bronypeanut
/whois Hipster_Brony
4Though, I recognize SirChuckles
8I may be confusing the two of them
8not 100% sure
4I've seen them both in the stream at the same time
8now that you mention it, they do sound familiar
8let's do this

12Alright.
I kind of missed that.
03I just came back from working out, only shortly after I cut the grass in 90 degree weather x.x
Hello DeadDanny
13But I don't know the other two very well
Ice
Go to Alaska
03not this part of Star Wars episode 2
8I've seen LunarTopaz around a lot on /oat/, mostly in GET threads
03I hate those
;o
EW
03I like the actual
03you know
03Jedi fighting
4Right, LunarTopaz is a frequent GETter
Not bedstuff :<
4But she's one of my 'favorite' users in the stream
03ooh, Pawn stars
03let's watch this instead
Tell them
Ooooh
8they comment frequently in the threads
'*again
8Indeed
4I'd suggest TurniBrony, but he doesn't show up for the streams much apparently
8I think Elky did too
8A Fistful of Dollars and The Room this week
03XD
03History Channel
03new episode in 2 mins
12A hoofful of dollars and the room.
8lol, dat ponychan wordfilter
Ok. Thanks.
03well not "new" per se
Any name?
8I would say probably not him, because he wouldn't be a particularly reliable mod
03Gettysburg
03but darn it
4But you're a mod
03there's a watermark on the top left with a countdown
4So it doesn't bother me
8but elky was here for the whole stream, right?
12Pony chan's word filter is starting to effect my brain.
4I don't recall
8ok
8so
They should just split the siginal and give you the option to remove it :P
4Agreed
8if they stand out, we approach them about half-ops
12got it.
03oh, it went away
4Do we approach them during or after streaming?
8question is... how
4Exactly
4PM?
12We are NOT beeping them like we did last time.
12that was a mistake.
4Silver has a good point, by the time I was leaving the stream I checked and I had about 4 or 5 PMs waiting for me >_<;
4All from earlier parts of the stream, too
/notice > /msg
12yeah.
4Yeah, I remember
8I think posting the link was a mistake, but I also don't want to annoy the Ponychan mods with threads like that
8so, I guess we can PM them after the stream?
12I like the idea of PMing them during the stream.
12or after.
8I would say after
8see if they stick around for the whole thing
4true
4Wait
4I think we're overlooking someone
13And now we have MisterBristle
8we were just talking about you :)
12MisterBristle
4I was talking about how much I HATED YOU >:I
4I didn't meaaaaaaaannnnn itttttttt :'(
I now pronounce you as SirBristle.
Please rise.
13Bristle
13is appearently bugged
Oh.
4But seriously, I think we're overlooking someone for half-ops position
Well that ruined my joke.
BRB gunna go get something to eat.

4ANYWAYS, let's get back on topic. Shall we?
12yesh.
8alright
8the movies
12What about this whole 3 movie gig we were discussing?
8What are our opinons on 3 movies?
4Only for special holidays
I do!
12Holidays and special events only.
03I know OF it
/me hides
/me shot
12I'm worn out modding two movies AND two episodes, not to mention if I get in durring pre-show.
8honestly, I would be fine with doing it every week, but I don't feel strongly either way
4And I was drained when we were trhough
4*through
4Still, three movies seems a bit too much every week
4I'm afraid we'll lose people's attention during that time
03LOL fail @ history channel
Hmm?
8since not everypony stays for the whole stream
8some just come for one movie
03they were like "new episode on Wednesday", and they were advertising the same episode that's on now
7I know I don't
4Like
4say
4If we decide to do a complete Lord of the Rings showing
/me slowclaps
4Well, of course not one go :P
12Over the course of the weekend, maybe.
4But over the course of the weekend, yeah
4But this would be something special, not something we do every week
8yes it would
8oh, and speaking of getting a bigger audience
4Hmm...yes, more exposure would be good for us
Back.
8with responses like, "yes, all the time"
8"Sometimes"
8"I have never heard of it, but would be interested"
8it does
4....maybe
4Lool
4*Look
4How much are we trying to make this something that'll last?
8I'm convinced that the reason we even got this off the ground was EQD
12DCD said it'll last as long as he can stream.
8I would like to make it last
More people come in the stream every week.
12Hell, he won't even be available this week, and we STILL have a Movie Night planned.
12Really? AWESOME.
@pony
12Lambda is 12Soar1in'
8this is kind of my baby, and i want to see it be successful
8yep
12This is the first time I've ever been on a project outside of school. I'm all for it.
4Yeah, I posted in the thread
8it was my 2nd day on Ponychan lol
4Saying I was all for the idea
8ah, nice
8sweet
4Look at us now lol
http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/spyro1.jpg
8lol, 1st think i thought of was Spike, actually
Hahaha.
Yeah, they're sort of similar.
12Oh, get this, I'm going to be making a logo for The Daily /oat/
8unfortunately, i have not had a thread of even moderate success since then :(
4I thought it looked like Spyro...
12Thanks.
12I have yet to make any thread that broke 100 posts outside of the Movie Night threads.
8oh wow, just looked at my message about it looking like Spike...
8English fail
Haha.
4I've only posted four threads
12I thought it looked like Spyro first.
4on Ponychan
12Didn't think of Spike until you said something.
8eyup
8let's discuss July 4th then
12We have to do that BEFORE The actual 4th
8I'll be available all day on the 4th
4I did some math for the Band of Brothers showing
8epically long
4and it'll be about 11 hours and 45 minutes long
4total
4Yeah
Hm.
4Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
8I was thinking about doing it over the course of the weekend
4I don't know, man
4Well
12There's an idea.
4...maybe over the weekend
12Split it in two for the Sat. and Sun. before.
12or that.
8or
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130680395964.jpg
lol
4I agree with the first idea
Around 8 anyway.
Yep.
UK
I could work it out in an hour.
:P
4You know, let's just do that?
8just show that movie?
4WAIT
4I KNOW
4I GOT IT
4and then Independence Day for the bad movie
8here's an idea I literally just had
8for the 4th
8we do the selection thread like normal, but have more movies, and over the course of the weekend, but not july 4th
8with the stipulation that the movies be war-related
8or america related
03Hahahaha

12That idea works.
4Friday would be movie night like regular
woah
Haha.
12I like the idea of Sat and SUn.
Cool right?
8so we would show one each day?
4True
Paste it in again on the same page to turn it off.

Tell them to choose another?
:P
I wrote "Ponies FTW!"
12we out and tell them our plans. We gotta let them know anyway.

8ok, fair enough
12alright, how about we wait until the week BEFORE that, since the suggestions won't be made until then anyway.

I'm not getting anything
12Yes.
huh
hm
it's not taking me anywhere
12At first.
It's not meant to.
...okay?
12But not if we have separate mane rooms being the same as Ponychan.
Latest version?
I don't know
go to spyroforum.com, then put that in the url bar and hit enter
You sure you copied it all right?
hello
yes
I'm stupid but not that stupid
But not everyone from ponychan would go on the IRC.
Also spam filters do exist. :P
4Dari said we could get bots to moderate for us, too
hmmm
Strange.
lol omg
12You don't understand how irc can work. There can be mane rooms that branch off into other rooms. for example: the /rp/ room can have links to places like /park/ and /pub/ and /OOC/ and places like /oat/ could have /rarity/ /rainbowdash/ and /nonsense/ rooms attached.
hai Skylands|Offline
Haha.

02Hey
See RDX's profile page. :P
hahaa
12It'd be no different from any other IRC network. But it's with ponies.
8oh, ok
8i admit, I know nothing about chatrooms
who's drawing with me right now?
the world may never know
whoever gave spyro a mustache and unibrow that's awesome
8well, I am officially never trusting rotten tomatoes for reviews ever again
4Yeah, I'm IRC illiterate as well
8The Room has a 30%
12lol
12See, IRC-ignorant folk like yourself (no offense) would just be able to access the rooms that are advertised in the main channel, but you'd still be branching out. Others like myself would be able to surf through them to the ones we want, even if they aren't there yet.
12....NI!
12...I had to do that.
8lol
03*WB02(FlameLugia02)03WB* - <FlameLugia> Please disregard that I was dropped as a child.
8the NI!'s were out of control last week
8but i expected as much
12That was hilarious.
12I don't mind spams like that. It's hilarious AND it's in context of the rules.
8were you going to post this idea on /oat/ or /meta/?
12hmm....not sure. It's barely Pony related, but it wouldn't garner much support if put on /meta/
12I might have to settle on putting it in /chat/
8Create it on /oat/
12Can do. I won't make a fuss if they move it.
12I just want to get the idea out there.
8I would be able to mod as well
8I'm pretty much on Ponychan all day anyway

8yeah, it might get a little busier in the fall for me with school
Guns. Not many guns in the UK.
I like that.
brb
12well, most likely we'd have more mods since this thing is on a much bigger scale.
Ello Ko
8oh yeah, for sure
12If anything, we could postpone actually MAKING the IRC itself until we feel we have enough mods to handle it.
4Yes, let's wait
IRC channels don't get destroyed just because there aren't enough mods though.
4My main concern is that I'll feel suffocated
8I would float the idea now and build interest for it

If we're talking IRC networks, unless you have enough people, I wouldn't suggest it. I've owned a few IRC networks related to anime, they don't do well unless you have atleast 100+ people interested. IRC channels? Cheaper (free)
How are you

8I live 9 hours from home
12lol
8there's a bunch of concerts I always want to go to, but they're all in detrit or columbus or somewhere equally inaccessible
I live at home, and if I stay in the UK it's not possible to be that far from home, haha.
Q-Sound enhancement
o.o
UK or Japan, I don't think I'd want to live in either one.
5It's right next to the T-BASS button.

Put the equestria girl song on loop, make it loud, that'll scare them away. xD
11That is a good song.
o_o;
Legit, or on mute?
:p
11lol
Yeah.
also, something exciting happened today :O
11nice.
8i only have a handful of friends here too
there were like 20 police officers pointing guns at him
xD
ooooooooooh
11My roomates and I only say three things to each other: "Hi" "How are you?" "I forgot my cardkey, can you let me in?"
8ah
8that's kind of how I was my freshman year
8i lived with one of my current roommates
Sayaka wut
Sheena's not here O:
11I'm actually only here for two years, but I am getting my Bacheler's degree from it.
O:
and two of them were holding assault rifles
O:
/me noms Sayaka instead.
:3333
11cool.
>.<
You're okay, right? :o
8i still have 2 years to go and i'm already 50 grand in debt
I use it a lot in regular IM's
8not a whole lot of schools offer Sports Management as a degree though
Haha, university costs are tripling or something for the year I'll be going.
Fun.
Yep.
8how much does college cost there?
11Like my friend has a 3 month summer vacation. I get two weeks off for mine.
11damn.
8damn this internship
When I'm going it'll be £9000 ($14,885) a year.
Then I'll have living expenses on top of that.
8damn
8you have no idea how much i envy you right now
4done
Student loans... T~T
8tell me about it
4wow, you guys are still here
Haha.
8of course, we were waiting for you :)
If I took them, it probably wouldn't bother me much, I don't want a family. However, my career doesn't necessarily need higher education.
8ah, i also don't really want a family, but I might have 100k in debt by the time i graduate
8thats a lot even for regular living expenses
Wolves! I found wolves!
4Guys, I made a 68 on my first online course exam
11I'm only doing classes.
4I'm...pretty content
8nice
8but yeah, it's an awesome internship, i just wish i could go home
8 68 on an exam with no studying?
8i'd call that a decent success
lmfao
11nice.
11thanks.
4No problem, man ^_^
8unfortunately, ponies have been less kind to my academics
Rather learn with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqUrRnh0XI&feature=related

8semester ended in may
4I also discovered ponies in March
11...interesting...
11Mine was in mid-April.
Hmm, I got into ponies in March.
8welcome to the herd
11I'd say welcome, but I'm seriosly in need of sleep. Yawning like crazy over here.
;3
4Shit, I don't have the "Welcome to the herd" picture on hand >_<
I think I originally watched it out of procrastination, but then I began to appreciate the characters and comedy.
u_u
4Here, I'll use this one instead. Mostly because it makes me laugh :P
