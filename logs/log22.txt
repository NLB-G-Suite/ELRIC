lol
what is that?
no clue what that means
indeed
a library by the looks of it
So I heard that C# is much easier to learn than C++, but is less powerful. Isn't C# the updated version of C++, shouldn't it be better?
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.min.js
Nice formatting there
XD that's disgusting
lol
I see something about CSS. Maybe new layout?
Hmm, maybe
/me looks at the Kosoveon on his back and puts kyu on his head
updates aren't always about power
whatever it is, SR didn't write it himself
I personaly know nothing about C# though
Yeah, but you would have though they wouldn't have made it worse in terms of power.
they may have had to sacrafice power for efficiency or speed
They could have just created the language for the user-friendliness
yeah
like Python
hmm
Python is sloow
You like my name
?
but easy to learn
:D?
Hm I suppose so.
XD
what the f
Annoying when you're used to java and want to use class variables everywhere
Haha, yeah
I grew to like the dynamic typing personally
03FUCK NETSPLITS IN THE ASS. ok.
xD
but it was hard getting used to
I agree with Sneas
XD
What the hell is bitcoinplus anyway?
no clue here
I personally didn't really see the point of it
C# is something created by microsoft i think.
but again
probably just brainwashed by java or something
C# has a runtime
correct me if im wrong.
I wouldn't, they'd love it.

I'm about to go x_x

It seems to generate 'bitcoins' for him or something.
what do you mean?
/me hugs back :(
because halfway through she still thought I was kidding
hmm
What's a bitcoin?
but then she got all interested in it
XD
No idea.
so like something that tells him of activity or something perhaps?
hm
http://www.bitcoinplus.com/generate
?
Bitcoin is digital currency.
>:L
and it's really slowing it down
you wanted me earlier?
Yeah, I was busy drawing Hitmonlee. xD
haha
I thought it might be slow...

Ha, that made me laugh too.
http://www.bitcoinplus.com/howbitcoinworks
sounds... interesting
7$ per bitcoin.
Meh.
so his upgrade
is to make himself money
Just seems like a new avenue for Internet gamblers.
Yep.
sounds GREAT for the rest of us >.<
lol
maybe I read it wrong, but...
what's this update
SR is updating SF
it sounds like /we'd/ be getting the bitcoins
what do we have to pay now or something
How?
that's what was using all the memory
and we're trying to figure out what it does
our computers were trying to "solve the puzzle" or whatever
but if we're making it where does it go?
No idea
it doesn't know my bank account
weird
Why would he force all users to take part in something that doesn't benefit him?
It doesn't use your bank account
12*articuno
I... don't know
I'm fairly sure it either gives him the bitcoins or splits them.
SR is in ur bank account, usin ur bitcoinz
this doesn't make much sense to me, I'm having trouble making sense of it
reading through that page I mean
"You can use as many computers as you like, all signed in to the same account, in order to generate bitcoin faster. "
12o-o
How can you make bitcoins if you don't have an account?
Does he expect everyone to have an entire computer lab running at once?
what if his code
makes everyone who's on the site automatically be signed in to his account
That's what I was thinking.
therefore generating a ton of money
That would have to be it.
That's really dishonest if you ask me
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Will this slow down my computer?
No. The bitcoin generator only uses your spare computing time. It runs at a low priority, so if you start using other applications, it will get out of the way so that your other applications won't slow down. Try it - you should find that your computer is just as fast (or slow) as it normally is.
if it is true
That has to be a lie.
low priority den shut everyting else DOWN i ned 2 genurate mah bitxoinz!!!11!1one!
that or he implemented it poorly
I'm confused
XD
if you're logged into something it gives you money? what?
Lies
Well either way - it was about money.
We don't really get it either
yeah, that's all we know
Nothing really added to the site.
we're trying to figure out the rest
Apparently whatever SR did was giving him or us some kind of virtual curency
*currency
:P
...We established this a long time ago. You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?
No...?
Why should I have been?
Forums aren't real time enough, I was thinking you should have a forum where each thread is real time.
No reason, I'm just surprised.
I'd never heard of bitcoin
^
Same.
I only had a vague idea of what it was.
Never had any real use for it.
Basically it's allows for anonymous, encrypted transactions. People use it for illegal trade.
*it
SR wants in on the black market.
He's been in on the blackmarket
Oh? Lol.
xD Yup, so he can compete with my Matter Destroyer app.
what with selling illegal lazorz and all?
:P
He sells lazors to teenagers who want to blind pilots.
Hahaha.
Let's just say some of his methods of making money haven't been exactly legal or ethical
Or sane.
Umbreon~~
12how goes bud :3
Not bad thanks, bit bored at the moment though, considering bed
Yourself? :>
12i'm messing with mabi
:o
12but i keep running into deadends no matter what route i take
12i want to do G14 but i can't even get past scene 1
UGH G14
12i decided to shift over to my healer pure
Shoot, 12:30.
12ran out of AP to rank up healing, first aid gets kind of hard to rank up now since i'm r9 and the quest to reach r8 is crazy
12so i shift to campfire and now i'm stuck there because i can't get hold of any wooden boards
First Aid is a pain to rank up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaPEr1Mg2i0
I've got it at r9
Pony MMO anyone? :P
12i'm at rank 9 as well
Well, it was nice patronizing you all and offering little to no support. Later.
12no thanks prince
I'm not bothering with the life skills much at the moment
patronizing?
12i hate combat
12i always die too easy
Apart from Refining, Blacksmithing
I didn't think you patronized us
12so i just like life skills
12only thing i'm good at
"You guys weren't aware of bitcoin before this?"
I've got all my combat skills at R1 so yeah
12meh
12even all the masteries?
Working on Magic skills at the moment
and yeah
12sword mastery blunt mastery
That just seems like genuine surprise.
12running mastery
I just read it as an honest question
Since when were they skills?
12since i am my old normal self and just like to be annoying
I was kind of exaggerating. But it didn't sit right with me after I said it. Anyway, hopefully I'll have Hitmonlee up by tomorrow.

Heh

oh I thought that would be what you say when you go into epic-chat tomorrow
oh
hahahaha
I should say that too
also

I was actually about to say Stormbda
It's because they're all designed to annoy me
Thus I was never paired with anyone I actually like
:P
and also with me the kids will be for real
:P
haha
and we would never name them something so ridiculous
CP...Hmm, I only know one thing that fits in that abbreviation.
I prefer something more like... Ash
or Brock
:O
your going to name your kid apple
Apple Head
Head is his middle name
Apple Bloom
or that yeah
or Big
Macintosh
Exactly
I feel like making a facebook account called Apple Head Mrozek
noq
*now
XDDDDD
I'll call him Big Mac when I'm feeling carefree
yay for pony references that RDX doesn't get

12and the wise title at the sametime
Closer than last time. XD

this time I knew it was 2 minute

Internet being cut off at 12 would suck.

Since I'm pretty much nocturnal.

it's insane
Yeah, I don't have to go in for school much at the moment.
Because of exams.
equipment and title buffs maybe
So, this other show I've been watching lately that I'm obsessed with
the main character
is a brony
12my title is the dragonslayer

Can't remember what the buffs are for that title
lady gaga is a brony too

she was seen with a rarity doll on her necklace
12maxMP +10
12max stam +10
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7e3p1I1UM
2:33
12defense and protection +2
And a possible Spyro fan? XD Lawl.
12has nothing to do with strength
I'm using The Furious Master of Smash
:P
*2:37 would be more accurate
Never heard of this show before.
Firefly
it's f'ing awesome
and knows every show and movie in existence
it got cancelled after ONE SEASON
but everyone loves it
so much they made a movie in place of season two
12screw smash and defense i'm going for r1 combat mastery
it's a Western crossed with a sci-fi
That sounds pretty cool.
12i'm so tired of easily being killed going to buff my HP so high that that doesn't happen
Bet no one's ever tried that before. XD
Combat Mastery is the easiest to get the CP for XD
I don't think so
12i don't want CP
it seems strange but it works really well
12sadly XD
XD
12i want to get r1 Windmill first before it gets too high
Actually I remember a sci-fi/western film.
this show makes up for my manliness lost due to MLP
Lost?
Manliness is gained from MLP. :P
hmm
maybe manliness isn't the right word
badassery
(if I ever had any to begin with)
oh dari
Yes?
I have yet to encounter an English character who's not evil however :P
and I'm almost done watching the movie
hahaha
we do
we really do
but you (accurately) make us stupid
Hahaha.
anyways I'm off
gonna have a couple of hours sleep before meeting my friends
laters
I swear one of the actors in that show is from 'Chuck'.
yeah
one is
I forget who though
I just know one of these people is in it
what the heck amazon
it stopped streaming my movie
only 15 minutes left
the torture
...
Owned.
:P
Those last 15 minutes you shall never see.
nah, I got the DVD
Oh, never mind then. XD
it came with a rented digital copy
and I'm too impatient to wait for it to ship
I might watch some ponies...Again...
so I'm watching the digital one
I will too
I've still got my nightlyepisode ahead of me
I don't know how you manage one a night.
Even though I've seen them all before usually I watch 2-3.
XD
Oh.
that's better
reset my connection
/me hopes for it to load his movie
[06:14] I don't know how you manage one a night.
[06:15] Even though I've seen them all before usually I watch 2-3.
haha
you know how I do it?
How?
I don't watch it until I'm already tired
Ahh.
damn it
That doesn't work with me.
still won't load
Sleep or ponies? Hmm...
You can guess the outcome of that.
finally

7Lol, yes.
7You can't control which player you're controlling. D:
7And dilemma:
7Constitution, when speaking of a specific document, is capitalized.
7Though the word unconstitutional is not, even if referring to that specific document.
what exactly happened.
7Jarring.
07uh
07isn't that because the Constitution is a proper noun
07but unconstitutional is describing something?
07o3o
7But the Constitution is unconstitutional, referring to that one specific constitution. D:
07o3o;
So what
Deal with it
/me shades
7Re-reading that, I meant that something that would be a paradox about the Constitution and yadayada.
the Constitution of FAIL

/me owws
03I just destroyed a hard drive
03and that thing
03was
03500GB hard drive = 5 circular plates made of solid metal
03I dare say that old hard drives from 3-4 years ago are a lot more durable than those mdae today
03as today they're plates of GLASS
03you could just drop it and bam
lol

03I have scissors that can cut metal
durf
hasn't updated, derp
rainbow has though
03they advertised being able to cut a penny in half
03and guess what, it does, I tried
nice
o-o
03but I basically hurt my hand because a hard drive is a little bigger than a penny LOL
03meaning it needs a lot more force
me and a friend once took a sledgehammer to a hard drive
03and LL, no I wasn't just destroying it because I'm a boy :P
well it was a maul, sledgehammer-axe thing
03I did it because generally if you throw out a hard drive you want to destroy it so that nobody can recover your data
we beat the scheisse out of that thing with the axe side and we barely managed to puncture a hole in the disk
03yeah
Dashing...
03I have a video on YouTube of my friend and i trying to destroy an old 60GB one
03that was the same way
03we barely put a dent in it
(:
it was 20GB
03after throwing it on the ground and taking a hammer to it
03I wish I had an axe XD
from 2000
03this was 2003
03the drive I just dejstroyed was early 2008
03and as far as i know, 500GB is the biggest IDE drives that have ever been made
we also did that to a couple old motherboards
03LOL
03why would you destroy motherboards
03or was it just for lulz?
they both didn't work
at all
one of them, my friend's he tried to use and it started smoking
i think he also said it made a popping noise
before aforementioned smoking
jeez
so yeah it was fubar already
we also smashed an old pentium chip
03LOL
doesnt she know smoking is bad for her health?
03I still have this router
/me shot
03that when you plug it in
03starts making crackling noises
03from it frying the motherboard
03I need to make a video of me running it over with a car
run it over with your fists
03ohnoez.
the other one
i think was the same

What episode are you on now?

he doesn't only watch one per night though :P
/me is a pro broney, watched all in 3 days.
I think it was 3.
Maybe it was longer.

Oh, it probably was 3, there's only 9 and a half hours of pony episodes.
So 3 hours a day I probably managed.

Not yet. My scanner isn't working and the friend who was going to scan it for me hasn't yet.
Stop! You violated the law. Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit.
I'd take a picture but it'd be awful quality.
Pretty much finished the model for Spyro, just need to add textures/colours for wings, tail, and spine ridges.
Then I can animate it.
I do, however, have a doodle for you all. http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/248322_10150187491779327_727564326_7112867_5469103_n.jpg

Mine are always just random polygons
Usually it's a bunch of separate doodles and I just combine them after a while.
yep
with patterns on them
That's awesome. Do you have any pictures?
I never scan them
I could though, if I went through all my notebooks
Do it. :D
tomorrow, when my parents aren't asleep

aaaaand see you guys again later, maybe
Lol.
Oh.
Haha.
Woah, she dun disappeared
I won't be up much longer
I need some sleep for tomorrow
Ok.
you have any more exams?
Yeah, today.
In 3 hours.
Haha
have you been able to sleep at all?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tjb14VoWjg&feature=player_embedded
Wow.
I tend to sleep a bit during the day.
Physics.
ah
you must be getting close to done, eh?
Nope, 13 or so more.
D:
really?
wow
I've never even had close to that many classes at once
I suppose the school system is just different over here.
max for me was 8
yeah, probably
I had 9 (one of which was lunch)
college is so weird for me
only having three or four classes per day
for her it's natural
Yeah.
how many per day do you have over there?
It used to be 8, but they changed it to 4 that are twice as long.
ah
so it went from what I had to what she had by the sounds of it
is it a small town where you live, or are you in more of a city area?
I live just outside a big town.
ah
Well, on the outskirts but technically still part of it.
and you go to that town's school I imagine?
there's not a small one in your neighborhood?
What the hell
So many people here
Yeah, I go to that town's school, but that's not what most people would expect.
It's a grammar school, so most people go to one of the other (probably larger) schools around.
ah
we don't have them, but I know of them
I kinda wished I was British when I was younger
:P
read up on what it's like there sometimes
Haha, who wouldn't? :P
Haha
XD
I still want to go there
Yeah, kind of lucky that I have my school near me, the others aren't nice places to be.
Mainly.
yeah, I can imagine
I'd probably be so out of place someplace like that
XD
Hah, my sister had the misfortune of having to go to a pretty bad school, she was really unhappy there. Goes to a different place now though (although she'll be leaving for university soon).
oh, your sister is older than you?
Yeah.
Just turned 18.
for some reason I always imagined her being younger when you mention her
Must be because I'm so mature. Hahaha. :P
Hahaha
or the reverse is true of her maybe
:P
Lol, maybe.
LOL this video is long, but AWESOME
the one from earlier?
Go go power rangers!
Yeah.
the anthology one?
Yep.
I think it's a compilation of loads of videos.
Made by different people.
ah, yeah
those can be good sometimes
as long as there isn't one person who ruins the whole thing because their bit is so bad
:P
They're all fairly short anyway.
LOL
JAZZ SPIKE!
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

hahahaha
when in the video?
Just before 16:00
hahahaha
that's awesome
Among the images that I downloaded was an executive's toy with Rainbow Dash instead of balls.
XD nice
A GIF
oh, I was on wikipedia earlier today
it explained Scootaloo as "A tomboy of epic proportions"
which I found hilarious

Good luck on exams again :P
Thanks. XD

lol
Wow. btards are actually being nice.
This makes no sense.
Impossible
No joke.
A lad had been going through a lot of problems lately regarding his conditions and surgeries, which include about 60+ surgeries, autism, synesthasia, ventilator, no cilia, and many others. He had issued a plea for support on youtube and had his video posted on /b/. Before /b/ got involved, the video only had 17 views. Soon, /b/ began to flood the video's comments with, get this, kind and encouraging words and support, even on his channel!
That video now has over 80,000+ views, along with a new video that followed up after words.
interestin.
I am majorly surprised. I thought they were just the scum of the internet.
They do nice things sometimes.
Hm.
i had botted a few thousand of those views
then i ran out of proxies
and so i stopped
i dont wanna get the kids views locked

Still - no nicer imageboards than ponychan.

There was a school having a swimming competition there
One group of the school students in the audience stand was waving a flag with an eagle on it.
I want that flag now
Flags with eagles on it = awesome

Oh well
/me gently sets down an eagle, hawk, and falcon into the chat

I love how the official workers go with all the jokes
that's so awesome
I saw some comments saying they're going to officially name Derpy "Derpy Hooves" in the next season
But I'm not sure if it's true
FUCK YES
also
0:46 is it just me or is she saying YOU'LL BE SEEING RAINBOOBS
XD
I think it said rainbows
U R MY RAINBOO
GURRRRRRL
that's what it sounds like to me
Or Rainbooms
....THAT'S probably what it is
whoops
:P
haha
I still can't believe they said bronies tbh I WONDER IF THEY'LL ACTUALLY USE THAT IN THE SECOND SEASON
maybe .__.
I wonder how they'd work it in though, like just calling the male ponies bronies?
yeah that's what I meant
I'm just saying if they do do that
fffffffffffff
I didn't think anyone but Faust cared about the fandom
I'll bet they'll do it though
And all the little girls who watch it will have no idea :P

03it's not CBox
03it's spambox
Jazz Spike is awesome. XD
hell yeah
03no, it's always that way
hey Nick.. Chan
03the point of those boxes is to spam them'
12Not really, that's just what people use them for
hey Nickary Chan
thats much better
12A CBox is actually suppose to be calmer then chat
/me is a ghost pokemon right now
03OMG
03I'm being sarcastic, nujmber one
03-j
03and number two, nobody actually does that, it's just for spamming
cause its fun
03so stfu XD
how about a DBox?
03DBox?
03those motion controlled things?
Dbox!
what about a Jack in the Box?
nah, its like, a Cbox, but increment the first letter by 1.
12You can only say one word in a DBox. "Eww"
12Or, Eww Apple
so thats why drf is spamimg there
Hey RDX
I just banned that Ziamber dude for two days

13though they said it could possibly take a few weeks
you pervert
03yeah so I heard
RDX can't moderate pony threads. Hahaha.
ol
*Lol
oh btwm
Yes I saw
i think a floating chair > non-floating chair
just another common troll
Someone keeps making these troll accounts too
LOL
But never posts in them
most of them are old
03it's good if you like spamming
planted before or around when that little "raid' junk happened
No, I mean recent ones
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4918.html
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4914.html
well that's not surprising either
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-4892.html
I think it's Ziamber doing it
one user shouldn't be allowed to create multiple accounts from the same IP
according to SR
I don't know how they're even being activated
Because none of them seem to be valid emails
6Still?
6What's she up to now?
Well, like I said he made it so that one IP couldn't have more then one account, but who knows, maybe he's changed something since then
12Yes, in this way that you can't get her on
Ziamber has posted from more than one IP
But it doesn't really matter
well I'll have to ask SR about it
As long as they're not posting
They're not really doing any harm, just annoying to anyone who looks at the newest member thing
well if he's going to keep pulling this crap from account to account I just want to get rid of them all together
12Just look at the CBox if you want to know what I mean: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php
hopefully he just shuts up after getting bored
I don't know it's him for sure, but it seems like it is
6Someone needs to tell her that not everyone can respond to her in 5 seconds. Ovo
o.o
One of the troll accounts had that Osama bin Laden picture in the website field
yeah I know
I'll ask SR
and some of them mention "Mark" and he mentioned that name in some of his nonsense spam
K
even though I'll get the same answer
Half of them have the word "cripple"
wtf
and since you guys are talking about ponies you should more then expect the common troll about :P
he was around long before the pony stuff started
I know it was just a joke
But you're probably right
:P
Ponies are the most anti-troll material ever.
you all remember what happened to Dragon Missionary
Well he was just way too sensitive
Dragon Missionary, nope?
SR just asked "Why?" to him collecting MLP
yeah but it all started with him admitting he was obssessed with My Little Pony
And he flipped out about it
yeah But SR didn't exactly make any attempts to stop
nor care about doing so
hence why Kazoobie is gone now
oh I'm not saying SR was completely innocent
12It's people like her that made Arti take down the CBox in the first place
6Hmm.
I know
he was sensative yes
I don't use the forums much.
Just talk to you guys.
Just that if something like that happens again it's not like anything like that will happen to any of us
03again, it's not a CBox, it's a spambox.
who are you?
We all have thicker skin than DM here
6Oh, and HML, you might also want to state that randomly saying messages when no one is in the chatbox is basically spam. :>
Yeah I know
it's just a very trollable topic
I think it's the least trollable topic there is...
12Or a SBox drf XD
either way if the guy shouldn't be able to post from the same IP
Well
people can try to troll
But they won't get anywhere
You've proven that it's much easier to troll people who don't like ponies, RDX. :P
Lolspam
Well I can't tell if anyone is talkng
Since the Cbox is borked
I didn't care if you guys were talking about ponies
you can talk about it as much as you want
12Nah, talking when no one is around is what a CBox is for
I just don't like it when others try to push me to do something I haven't chosen to do myself, at least extensively :P
Yeah right, he didn't care. Haha.
Mhm
Ah well
I didn't mean to push you to do anything, I was just talking about them, sorry.
no need to be sorry
that and after working 70 hours a week I can be in a very inpatient mood myself
either way it's all good
besides I'm too busy watching our dumbass president humiliate himself
Heh
what did he do now?
nothing major
12Wb
cept of course being overseas pandering to appearances when he should be back here taking care of the recent devestation in the mid west
10Thanks
that fuck up with english royalty was especially humerous for me though
I didn't hear about that one
this country is already fucked up enough and he just adds more to the pile
10I think this is her first day back
12Oh, so she has in a way
12Anyway, bbl
yeah this guy seems to be obsessed with the word "mark" for some reason
but he's posting from multipe IP's
It's kind of annoying that you can't tell what IP someone registered from
you can only see their IP after they post
So we can't just ban all the IPs the accounts are from
yeah
06She seems to be unable to understand the concept of... well, that people aren't constantly watching the cbox.

If you're exposed to more than 1000K for an hour, you'll turn into an Espeon
13You say that like it's a bad thing :3c
actually, it fires rays that are -50K
that are so cold it turns things floofy
don't question the logic
No, if it's -50K, it unfloofs them
or you will be floofed
it turns them into trools
06how can temperatures under absolute zero make anything fluffy
/me floofies Espeon
06It would just make stuff really really hard because nothing would be able to move at all

It's not temperatures, it's exposure rates

You're the man(ly)

lol
13I'm a paper hat
13o-o
4You there?
Yep.
13:DDD
let's go find mars hobbes! :D
/me shot
Just not speaking.
4I see
/me shot again for the CAH reference
Not sure what they're showing after this.
4I can't watch after it
Ok.
4Promised friend I'd play Portal 2
Ah right.
13Random Question Time!
ok forgive me for asking but
13If your best friend turned into a sheep, would you shear him/her?
WHAT IS PORTAL 2 no one ever shuts up about it ever and I have no fucking clue what it is
I mean I know it's a game
but what makes it different from any other game
if they owed me money, yes
then I can use their wool to make a sweater as payment :B
06AE LOL
06More like
06RANDOM Question Time
4hi hi
hi chao
4:)
There aren't really any other games like it.
4*glomps*
/me is glomped o3o
I don't think anyway.
okay well what I mean is what's it even about
my turn, then:
4*sigh* sadly, i never could get my umbreon
4oh well
If you had to live the rest of your life as a fruit, what would it be?
I've not played it. All I know is you have portal guns - you shoot two portal ten you go in on and come out of the other.
4hmmmmmmmm
a poisonous berry
13Strawberry~~
the most poisonous on earth so noone could eat you
I prefer cherries
4Apple
Lime here~
Apple, and apples
4so someone will eat me and i will be useful
13FRUITSONAS :D
06A Kiwi. Because it has "fur". But more seriously though, probably an apple :P
Although most poeple know about things that it spawns like "The cake is a lie".
06aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
o-o
well played.
06KIWI IS MY SPIRIT-...FRUIT?
Rest of my life.... lemon
4lol
4Pattyrick is sour XD
I AM A LIME AND PROUD OF IT >:3
06find a few others and have a par- no I won't
I love lemons! I don't care if they make me pucker and cringe, they're sooooo goood :P
13LOL
06I prefer lime over lemon but
06Both are okay
;3
my favorite fruit would probably be the peach
because I loooove canned peaches <3
bananas would be a close second
Aww, time for bed D=
Goodnight er'body!
/me yawn
but I'll stick with limes because they are good to have with certain foods
night patty
13I think rocks have boring lives
13especially because they don't live to begin with
My IQ has dropped significally in the last twenty minutes.
Thanks, guys.
13they just sit thereon their non-existant ass watching the world go by for years with their non-existant eyes
13if they're lucky, someone will come along, pick them up and throw them
4what happned?
so many eons o_o
13and for that brief period of time, they will feel "happy" with their non-existant emotions
eons everywhere! *does a toy story meme stance*
13but that is so rare
if I was quartz I wouldn't mind
13so instead they sit there and wait patiently in the hopes that someone will throw them
because at least people would look at me admiringly from time to time
13because that's the only feeling of non-existant happiness they'll ever feel
13because they are otherwise ignored by the rest of the world
13and they can't do anything about it
06>be a stone
13because they're rocks
06>use millions of years to reach the beach
13Rock Pity
13;-;
06>some kid THROWS you back into the water
MLP FIM holy grail?
06>cry
06But mostly
06yawn
13LOL
13but maybe that's a part of their happiness
13the excitement of washing up onto a beach and waiting for someone to throw them
13its like going down a slide
13you climb to the top, then slide down
13it makes you happy
13because if no one picks you up and throws you, you're doomed to sit there on the shore doing nothing, because you're a rock and are incapable of doing anything yourself
13it makes sense :D
06a slide
06taking years to "climb"
06and seconds to slide down
06NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT
13But the enjoyment of sliding down is worth the wait :D
13because it's all they "live" for
13since they can't do anything else
13;-;
4omg
4omg
4omg
4drf is here
4RUN!!!!
/me 4hides
13You're not going anywhere until you pity the rock
13:<
13Something tells me none of you are following my genius logic here
13When you all die and reincarnate as rocks, you will all remember my words with your non-existent memories
13and you will think to yourself
13"she was right :|"
4well
4i'm outta here

13:|
you know
13Something tells me I should sleep soon, LOL
rocks don't deserve pity
strings do
the ones from string theory
String theory sucks.
think of it this way: every atom according to that theory is made of billions of trillions of vibrating strings
if you were one of those strings, what would happen to your self esteem?
:<
13String theory is mentioned in an anime I recently watched LOL
12:<
13if I remember correctly, she went on about how the universe was created because someone swung a string really fast or something
13|D
wait what o-o
Bronies get mentioned in an official Hasbro MLP advert and they used the fan name for a pony. :o
13LOL it's k Kosoveon, it's not supposed to make sense |D
13Despite being a self-proclaimed genius, she obviously had no idea what she was talking about LOL
I'm not worried about it not making sense
I'm worried about it being right D:

Well normally I would just use Control+C to kill the process but I can't do that while it thinks I'm pressing the buttons to the message
Didn't take it into account once I started it
I could have killed it if I had Luka up but then luka died before when I was doing things... I should think these things through..
Haha, wow that's good.
o-o
I never know how people write lyrics, seems hard.

Ahh.
I'm lucky enough to be free on Friday when the stream is.

Same time (other than that they just changed it) every Friday.
interesting...
Though I'm not sure if it will happen next Friday.
just heard about this on equestria daily
NewDCD (the streamer) has an exam then.
So he can't stream it next Friday. Not sure if someone else is doing it that time or not.

oh
03darn it, walmart.com is broken
XD
you broke it
03nah
03but I'm trying to check if the store here carries the CD
03since I want a clean version
03and Walmart carries those
03so I go to "pick a store"
03and I click "choose this one"
03and nothing happens
03o.o
03tried in Firefox and IE
03let's try Opera LOL
03...
03that worked
03holy crap
o.o
03...
03"store information not available"
03OK then
call them>?
03at 3:25 AM?
03yeah right
yes
they are open 24/7
might as well give them some company
just because they sell apple products doesn't mean they can't get lonely
ronery
03the one here isn't open 24/7
oh
03oh darn it
03having the CD freeze up like that basically made it so I can't open the tray
03frick

03I am in shock
03iTunes was the only program that was able to eject the drive
lol
use the little trick then
the needle in the hole
works everytime :3
03well
03that does work
03but
but what?
03that doesn't tell the computer that you've ejected the drive
03so it still thinks the disc is in there
03which... is not what I want
oh...
ithttp://www.google.co.nz/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=eject.exe
then shutdown the Pc, open up, and do your thing!
03yeah I didn't want to reboot though
03and I had iTunes open (I know, blasphemy)

13LOL
7Makes EV Training Ilex a li'l difficult. o3o
13Go to Giant Chasm where all the Audinos are more powerful, give more exp and DON'T use Heal Pulse :3
7No, they still do.
13Really? The Audinos at Giant Chasm never use Heal Pulse for me o-o
7Only the level 55 ones (highest you can get) don't.
13I just assumed none of them knew that move anymore
13Well, seeing those Pokemon are awesome
13but they are such a pain to catch
7Indeed.
7But it's also fun to challenge yourself to catch them under optimal conditions. :3
13True :P
13But damn, I've had a much easier time catching legendaries than that thing xD
7Lol.
7Well, catch rates and all that stuff. XD

4"Why won't anyone be rational?" Becuase you touch yourself at night, Sparkle
maybe they actually need to giver her more episodes to develop her character more?
4Yes
4Pinkie, from what I heard, is a tragic character
I didn't really like Rarity until she got a couple
4Yeah
4Same with me
4I mean, TWilight is just there to be...kinda there
yeah
it's impossible to have an episode without her in it
because she always has to do the moral thing at the end
4Ya
4Why don't we have her learn something...y'know...important
4Cuz there is such a thing of 'ACTUALLY HAVING WEAKNESS'
I can kinda see weakness in her
She's not very open minded for one thing
4Tru
4But one compared to the billion powers she magically can get?
And she was useless with everything in Winter Wrap Up until her organization skills came in
yeah, true

Hey VideoG2.
Espy~
Heya!
:3
What's up?
Not much here, how about you?
I finally got all of my team members on White version to Lv. 100 X3
Just saw the link to the Brony movie night in the Daily Oat, and I thought I'd check it out.
Seems I missed it though.
Yeah, it was yesterday.
Ah darn.
What're you doing here then?
And I found a Shiny Tropius yesterday.
I'll just leave myself in here till next week. (:
xD
I'm not actually sure whether it's happening or not next week though, NewDCD (the streamer) has an exam, so I don't think he can do it.
Maybe someone else is picking it up for him.
06Heya =o
Ah, I hope so!
Hey :3
I'm sad that I managed to miss Monty Python today. XP
/me still hasn't levelled a single Pokemon to lv 100 before
I've leveled up my Empoleon to Lv. 100 in Pearl,
Yeah, I missed half of it.
But that was forever ago.
They started two hours earlier this time.
Ah
I'm suprised I managed to do that with the moveset he had X3
Hey :3
Hey Jack_brony.
hi RJ!
:3
Wow, a whole 3 of us in here now. :P
what is this?
and who be ye?
13The highest I've ever levelled a Pokemon is lv 80 I think, and that's my team in HeartGold |D
This is the channel for brony movie night.
Which was yesterday.
I'm still just lurking in here from then. :)
of this i am aware.
why are you still here for so long?
I only managed to get a Pokemon to Lv. 62 in SoulSilver XP
RJ! *glomps*
Why not? I can talk to people when they join. :o
X3
13and tbh I need to breed and retrain most of them because I feel the need to EV train them properly LOL
/me is glomped
but being here for so long. sounds unhealthy, really.
/me doesn't pay much attention to EV training.
Well I don't actually have to be at the computer to be in here.
And I can see when people join, I don't have to watch the window to check.
right.
/me is back from the idle world
aaaaaaanyway, i'ma go and watch weeds.
X3
but first,
06:3
13I'm not really into competitive battling, I just EV train because it makes me happy to see the results of my hard work :3
Eh, my Absol
what is your favorite mlp episode?
Oops,
/me pokes Ray
Hmm. I've never really thought about it, I loved the whole series to much. :o

Well cya later then.

Oh, good.
/me tosses out a Ninjask

03too late to draw anything
1:33 here too.
/me is drawing at the moment
XP
03o:
04Craig
04Is it too late?
04Or will it be too late in 30 minutes?
/me 7presses the right (mouse) key.
03Okay let me re-phrase
You have a key on your mouse?
Woah. I want one.
03I'm a lazy ass and can't be bothered to draw anything at this time due to my tiredness
:P
04Ok fair enough XD
03Oh I know a way to keep myself entertained
03I hope everyone here actually has a TST account?
I don't think I've ever posted on it.
03Huh
04XD
03Basically
I tend to prefer IRC to forums.
/me has one but she's somewhat inactive.
03I'll leave a comment on anyone's profiles right now if they just say so
04sure
03I like leaving comments
04so
03don't worry I won't invade any with ponies
Hahaha.
7o3o
Spam Angel bunny.
He doesn't get enough love.
03What do I see here
03Is this a brony that stands before me?
Yep.
03*rainbow dash salute*
Haha.
7Pavilume? (Outsaying my fakemon name ideas.)
You saw the extended Equestria Girls video?
7Sounds too much like Vileplume. X.x
03I'll hop over into a PC since I'm sure a pokemon chat would not like some pony discussion :P
03HELL YES DID I SEE IT
03My mind = blown
04I really don't mind
04It gives me something to read while I kill sand dragons
03How long have you been a brony?
03LOL about the same as me then
03You might be a bit ahead though
03I've only seen the season once
03HOWEVER
03I have looked back at a few episodes
03Do you browse Ponychan at all? :P
035... 5000 pony pictures?
03I don't even have 1000 D:
7Peavilume?
03Wow
/me 7keeps her thoughts to herself about that.
03I lurk most of the time on ponychan. I post occasionally though as Draco Magica
03oat is where I spend most of my time
03Yep
03All three times so far
Maybe if you sprite it, I could look at it and name it.
03Have you ever posted on ponychan?
03I'd love to know if I've seen you around before
03Awww
7Mmm'kay.
03I think I might have seen it once before :O
Hey derp.
03Nicely done ^_^
/me 7is spriting right as we type, so...
X3
03My brother put this together http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0clN27DID7s
/me is drawing on MSPaint.
03Although he mainly just extended it
ah sup
03The main tune belongs to WoodenToaster
03Do you just spend most of your time in the brony movie night chat?
/me wants to draw :<
03^_^
03What chat is this?
03Ah
03o:
03Lol it's about time you started using this chat window
03It's been a pain flicking between the two
03Do you have MSN?
03Aww
03I'd love to be able to keep in contact with a fellow brony
03I rarely visit this IRC
03And the one time I do I meet someone I haven't met before who just so happens to like teh ponehs
03LOL
03Judging from the "It's 1:33 here too" and the spelling "mum"
03:D
03I'm getting happier by the second
03England? Scotland? Wales?
03:D
03ah crap I have terrible geography skills
03Time for google maps
03I live in suffolk
03It's about an hour away from London. North-east
03Yeah. Oh well!
03Hm. You didn't happen to go in Omegle one time and chat with a few bronies?
13Does anyone here know how good/bad Firefox 4 is?
03Ah
03It's just I met a brony in omegle who also lurks Ponychan
03Just asking in the off-chance that it might be you
03That would complete my day
/me sits next to Kitten
02No, I have yet to get it lol
7I got it. o3o
03I use Chrome because firefox gives me viruses and IE sucks
02I keep telling firefox I'd download it later
7From a non-technical standpoint, it's different in appearance, but rather optimized as well.
03:P
7Compare dA 6 to 7.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH5ay10RTGY
looks like fun
13Hm, not sure whether to get it or not
03It's nice to be recognised
13since yesterday, my firefox has been really weird and keeps using up all my CPU
03Have you posted in this yet?
03http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/25565581
13so every now and then I have to restart firefox to get it to go back to normal
13dunno what's causing it though
03I was the third poster in. Go me.
03Ah. Uh... I may have left after Monty Python
03http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/25565581.html
7It does that every few days.
Interesting.
03It was late and I needed sleepies :<
13But I've never had this problem at all until yesterday o-o
7How many windows and tabs do you use at once? :P
03Ponies driving you to insomnia too?
13Not many :B I normally have a maximum of 3 tabs
upgrade to firefox 6. fixt.
/me hides
Isn't it?
03Ahhh
I feel like eating a banana now.
BRB
03It seems to vary for me
03One moment I'm up until 6am
03The next I can barely make it past 1am
03Possibly
02brb, food ~
03666
03So the inevitable question:
03Who's your favourite pony? :O
03Well, in general I suppose xD
03I was thinking mane 6 though
03Rainbow Dash <3
/me flops
03LOL yeah
03And Trixie
:3
03Bronies love running away with their imagination
03Derpy is a great example
03o:
04well
04this sucks
7Eh, Lyon?
03Nah from what I've heard
03Yes she's an official character now
03But she's going to be doing the same as season 1
03Except she's included in storyboarding now and stuff
03think of it like a where's wally
03Spot Derpy :P
04Just extremely bored.
hi
7Ah.
03I'm hoping to see a bit more Luna
03I'm curious as to what her character is like
03Instead of all the fan interpretations
03LOL
03I'd laugh if that was the only thing that happened
03Episode 1 of the second season
03BANISHED TO THE MOON
/me re-watches anime.
13Goodnight all :3
03The fate of her name is unknown.

whats up?
03I don't even have folders :D
what the fuck
03I just name every single image
hi to you too
where the hell is Altair
heya
03he died or something
03Well I just did it since I started collecting them so I can't stop now...
03however I just dump all my Spiderman images in one folder, unnamed
._.
Nah, his computer exploded when he tried to extract all the porn he downloaded earlier.
10o.o hi NS

Sneas
/me hugs Sky :3
do you still have the backup services from a few months ago?
03I dunno
/me hugs Sneas back
03probably
Can we bring those up?
woah

03how?
Do you have them? That's the thing
03Anope on linux = .-.

Lol.
03?
because iirc it was on your computer and not mine
7I've sketched a tentative idea for the fakemon.
03o.o
03I thought it was on yours
really?
remember that time when Altair's server got hit by lightning?
I swear it was on yours
7Wanna see it?
7And name it?
03yeah
/me will look
do you have it still? if not I'll just reinstall anope and just make the temp services
I'll check if I have a backup
03I don't think I do .-.
No services - party.
don't think I do either
oh well
I'll just go set up services

Hold on, be right back XP
nothing here will be saved when his server comes back up

03I started getting interested about that time
03I saw people talking about it on a pony thread on /b/

Hello
04?
Is DCD finding a streamer for next week, or is it just not happening?
12fhuwergh
12That irc
He is trying to find one before Monday
A streamer, that is
Hmm.
"I whip my tail back and forth" - priceless.
I'd do it if he can't find anyone else, he tells me which programs to use and my connection is fast enough.
Haven't you been here since yesterday?
Yeah.
Why are you still here, then?
I don't know, why did you come back? :P
Just AFKing in here till next week.
Ah
Well
Have fun, I think I'm gonna lie down for a while
Have a good night

Be the best pony or kill everyone else?
lolwut XD
To make everyone happy of course! :D
http://www.explosm.net/comics/1112/
Hahahaha.
for drf bashing AM broadcasting he is forgetting a key fact
and FM, when decoding uses a sortove AM decoding ?
for the regular plain old mono FM it is true frequency modulation
AM noise is rejected
FM > hy: FM:AM > slope detector
because it does not need much bandwidth
or frequency discriminator
I love this picture. XD
in theory these should appear on an audio spectrum analyzer on a computer with a 24 bit soundcard sampling at 192 KHz
oh?
maybe so
do you have a regular mono FM receiver and a sound card capable of 24 bit 192 KHz recording?
well, keep in mind, you can only see frequencies up to 96khz if you do a fft analysis
my stereo system can receive FM
well you know what
then he's boring to
my soundcard claims to do 24b: 192khz
Lol, I'll pass that on for you :P
go for it
but i herd realtek ones have a mediocre or bad snr
:P
(on board sound btw)
that might be a problem
if it claims 24 bit 192 KHz and is cheap it might be upsampling from 16 bit 48 KHz
HD RADIO FAIL
WFMS 95.5 has their audio severely out of sync
/me rolls
Rolls...What?
D-20
You are today's big winrar.
Claim your prize.
SA
out of sync?
well, when i record blanks, i see reflections beyond 24k, that may be either upscaling or aliasing, and some peaks from my soundcard
perhaps
when i record my stereo, i get some peaks, mb from the stereo or FM
have you taken a screen shot of it?
i'll do it now
http://imgur.com/a/uC0BF
looks like noise products to me
18k, fm carrier?
19 KHz is the pilot tone
yea, i can see that in the second pix
just as I suspected earlier
wait a minute
I SEE IT!
look around 35 KHz
the first screenshot is blank noise
http://i.imgur.com/J5wkl.png @ 37, that might be a speech harmonic ?
nope
also, do you see that second one at 57 KHz?
eh, well, i made a second recording, it goes up and down @ 38
not much at 57
goes up & down with music
you captured both
congratulations
theory confirmed!
that is the third harmonic to the FM stereo pilot tone
in dis new shot, i can't see 19. but i see a dip at 15
same or different FM station
same
interesting
yeaa, i think it's a fluke
might be
but they passed compared to what I saw on waveform analysis when I was running an FM station with software on a PC
so maybe that was a valid capture
you never know
oh, if you compare the 2 captures on http://imgur.com/a/uC0BF, 1 is blank noise and 2 is FM audio, the peaks are at almost the same places
this is encouraging
I looked at the differences and maybe there is some truth
but a test with a better sound card is needed
i.e, blank noise without my FM stereo connected.
yep
it seems the random peaks change from recording to recording, since i did one earlier
that is quite a high noise floor
yea, mb a sucky soundcard & a sucky power system
what is interesting is the signature passes
visually I can't tell
'it just happens to. by coincidence.
they look IDENTICAL to the carriers I am looking for
so it is quite a coincidence
yes.
does your tuner have RDS as well?
what
the logo looks like a sideways figure 8 with RDS next to it
its about the easiest way to tell
it's just a normal hi-fi from a Sony consumer store store
nah
has a tape & cd player too
might not be your tuner then
the sound card is highly suspect
everything's highly suspect.
the sound card most of all
my audio cable's like, 15ft long, and the power supply, too
03hm
03anyone know where I might find 3mm P1 Phillips screws?
03they're the kind mini-PCI express cards use
03I need a few
radioshack?
the long audio cable is the most suspicious
ideally you would use one shielded for RFI
and EMI
it runs right next to my TV cable, too
/me hides
and a few other USB, etc, cables
USB cables I am not worried about
WFMS 95.5 has their audio severely out of sync < what do you mean?
IBOC digital audo to analog FM audio
03well I'm gonna shutdown for a bit
they have to match up due to the digital receivers blending to digital from analog
so the digital stream is behind the analog stream?
yes
due to the encoding process
the analog signal is traditional FM stereo
o-o

outside connections could not be made
however i connect via local network, so it seemed to be okay for me

7How does Peyevil sound?
uuh...I don't know whether to laugh hard or be genuinely confused at that
7O_o
7Well, differences in their vocabulary?
7English English, Nick.
7As in, from England.
lol difference in spelling does not warrant a totally different language
7It's more of the slang here and there.
7E.g, "robot" in South-African English refers to a traffic light.
7Hmm.
7So he is commenting on the differences in writing...
its not like speaking english, german, french, russian is important anymore, as long as you know how english speaking countries spell english words different is ok xD

it just matches your refresh rate with fps rate of game

/me wishes he had MH ._>
/me also wishes he still had a Wii
02Go get a wii
02Screw Project café
orly
:>
that reminds me
what yall think of the supposed leaked smash bros strife image?
02Project café is comming in 2012 or 2013
02So you have time
I think it's fake
but I've been wrong before :P
I heard its just a spoof to get final fantasy 7 fans pumped since strife is the surname of cloud
and ray, I'm thinking about getting it within the next couple months
I'm saving for it now
and he's CONSTANTLY requested as a smash character :\
I think that's just because "strife" is a synonym for "brawl"
02Kosovo
and megaman :\
02Here take the easy path, sell something for a lot of money
02Then profit
Problem
I got nothing I can or want to sell D:
I got a bunch of old stuff, and a 360
if ANY capcom character should be in a new smash as a guest it should be Ryu. You can see the SF influence in smash in the opening cinematic in the original Smash where Kirby faces down mario all SF animated movie style
which I am NOT selling because I want to play bioshock infinite
02Sell the 360 and th-- FUUU
02Ok, now the hard path\
02WORK. NOW.
02:3
Problem
no jobs
or at least not until summer time XD
believe me, I've tried
02xD
I've applied to like 19 different places
02Sell your 3DS? *shot*
none of them want minors in school
NO
>:(
how evil of youuuu :P
02YESZ
02*creepy voice* I'm EVVVIIIIILLLLLLL
02>:3c
/me eeps
well...there is another thing I could do
I have a fund for this vaction trip to Nebraska in the summer
spending money basically
I could use a chunk of it to speed up the process so I get a wii in a couple weeks
*so I can
I hope gamestop sells those mario kart wii bundles for $150
03EW NEW WII BUNDLES
but...I still gotta get brawl too >_>
03for several reasons
031. New Wiis can't be hacked, and EW WIIS THAT AREN'T HACKED
032. WTF paying $20 for Wii sports?
"Can't be hacked" LOL
Funny.
03well
03you can do software hacking
03but from what I've read, it will refuse to read any sort of DVD+R disc
03if you try to use a software loader
03I have a first-run Wii and I put a WiiKey on that thing, even now I can just burn the ISO, pop it in the Wii, good as new
03I mean
03hacking aside
03having a $150 bundle that comes with Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort and then buying MKWii for what, $30 or so? is a better deal than getting MKWii with it and buying Wii Sports ($20) and Wii Sports Resort ($50) separately
o.o
Wii sports costs money? O_o
I thought it was free, or it was when I got a wii ages ago.
03Yes it does
03because of the crappy new Wii bundle that comes with Mario Kart, they're now selling Wii Sports for $20.
03hence
03> EW NEW WII BUNDLES
That's weird.
03also LOL GAMESTOP
03Just go get a Wii on ebay for like $70
03:)
I hope project cafe' is hackable and can run the same wii homebrew
:<
You know some guy got the kinect working on PS3? I thought that was pretty funny.
I don't really like the look of PS3 move or Xbox kinect though.
03EW PS3 MOVE

03it's kinda silly but it works

German autobahn.
you know, that road system with the insanely high (fun) speed limits
they have speed limits?
yeah, it's called the peak speed of a car
:P
does that even count?
i guess technically it's still a speed limit, just that it's impossible to break it
If you lean forward in your seat at the car's top speed you can break it.

just that it lags about..maybe 15 FPS?
Twilight Sparkle has evolved into rapidash!
it could a little
7Lol.
what about Resolution?
7And well, at least I'm making the ideas seem reasonable. :P
or what would be preffered Resolution on a Vista
7But I have a headache now, and I've got dinner to attend to.
7See you in a sec.
on a vista as os? o.o
kay
there isn't really a preferred resolution of windows, it's based off your hardware specs
Windows Vista, 64 bit
well I don't know that D:<
and yes again, lower resolutions = more FPS
less data to render
usually you don't notice it unless it's a super-intensive game or you have an older graphics card
is 1280 x 960 low? o3o
not really
/me noms Skylands
but then again, compared to my 2880x1024
:P
low resolution as in like
800x600
or 1024x768 even

12o-o
i have multiple monitors, so i am cheating
/me blinks
what average FPS should I have?
for I'm in the Morrowind FPS Optimizer
o.o
depends on the game really
like i said, i've never played that game
I like 24.
FPS
i know in most games, i get anywhere from 40-60
I'll try 20
come back..well
someone likes to brag D:<

that's not that high

you nostalgia you lose
lol
I am back
okay, so the MINIMUM FPS Optimizer did help
20 is greater than 15
but there is still a bit of lag
hi
/me also poofs
what does it mean if something says
High FPS is pointless dpending on your monitor though anyway.
depending*
"minimize program to the system tray"
dinner brb
I'm thinking it's my graphics card
though would mod amount also factor in with lag?
The number of the mods not so much as what they do.
with the overhaul changes the graphics and sound
inserts some new meshes and the like
though I've seen it work fine
most mods I placed before that did not lag, overhaul caused it perhaps
Well if it makes the game more graphically intensive then yeah.
hmm..
Dos anti-aliasing have any determination in this?
Yeah.
If you turn it off it's likely to be at least slightly faster.
I don't know if it'd be noticeable though.
it is off
though here's an example of it (the mod) working fine
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynAnibKFphQ&feature=related
bbl
my FPS is at fucking 4-9
Hm.
What kind of graphics card have you got?
I have no idea
computer is maybe 2-3 years old
but, I have no idea what my graphics card is
nor how to find out
If it's just the one that came with the compute it's probably not very good.
computer*
how do I find out?
and how can I replace it with an awesome but cheap one
How much would you be willing to spend on one?
What OS are you on?
0,0PONIES
since my mother owes me a unfathonable amount of money
maybe 300?
won'
*won't pay one for fucking 500
Yes
I had a list of some that were supposed to be the best for money somewhere.

Oh, this is it.
http://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/15-best-graphics-cards-in-the-world-today-654141?artc_pg=4
Good
is number 1 or 5 the best?
One.
appearantly just some 250 dollars
210 = 346 dollars.
Wat

hell its 269 in Dallas
Well maybe they have the prices wrong on that site then.
Because £210 = $346
I don't know what to say.
why the fuck does it have to be in Dallas
I hate Dallas

though how does this look? http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=AMD+Radeon+HD+6950&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=11344147097762301192&sa=X&ei=GeDiTeXVBYjY0QG6yPG-Bw&ved=0CEoQ8gIwAg
I think the one they're talking about is 2GB.
:|
But I don't see any that look exactly like the one picture on the site.
XFX Radeon HD 6950 Graphics adapter looks nearly fucking identical
the one difference is the cover
Well it's your money.
02I see Quan finished the peacock
03LOL pee
03LOL cock
/me hides
but what would be the difference of the 2GB and the 1GB?
02That reminds me of a story...
Probably performance.
XFX AMD Radeon HD 6950 (HD-695X-CNFC) 2048MB PCIe
I think it might be that one.
02Anywho back to bed
/me 7is amused by Dream World.
7Visit Home of SCHOOL. o.O
http://shop.amd.com/US/_layouts/shop/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=HD-695X-CNFC&region=us-en this is what the image is
the 2GB one is covered in all black
so either the one I linked is the 1GB
cheshire cat
02Eh?
or something is wrong with the images
I don't follow what you are saying.
That the graphics card is causing the lag, because the graphics in-game are too much for it
03LOL
03I found the same username twice.
03in the same map.
That's kind of the whole point of getting a better graphics card, so it can render the game on your screen faster and in higher detail.
7o.o
well so far, I didn't need one
7Weird indeed.
even for games like Dragon Age Origins
which my computer maintained a good FPS of...30-50
7And sorry, Shiny, if the fakemon went on a completely different design than I expected.
I don't know, if you don't want to get a new graphics card, don't, just use less intensive settings.
/me shrugs
whatever is best
02I still love the design lol, I just couldn't read the biography
02I'll have to wait until my headache isn't as bad
7Ah, that.

they typically CAN'T leave it at just that

no, thats just the footnote
trust me
I think you're missing the point
Look at how pretty she is :O
I love having sushi shoved down my throat though
omg loveeeeeeeeeee sushi <3333333
because a religious person will assume you at least know that Jesus is the focal point of their religion
well, Jesus and God...and a ghost

Im pulling an all nighter for my homework x_x
ow...
bah.....
so ns1 and ns2 are both the same ip
It's possible, but anytime I've ever tried to do that, the service has been shakey
I'm pretty sure I've seen tutorials for setting up master/slave server on Bind.
theoretically it should work
Actually we tried that a couple years back
what if its 2 IPs hosted by the same server
I think what happens is if the DNS gets no reply, it proprogates that lack of reply or something, I don't know
what if its 2 IPs hosted by the same server?
I don't see how that would make any difference

I'm surprised Silver didn't kick you
Hey guys
Why is there reason to?
Hello, Hipster
8Fucking colors, how do they work?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
4There
Colours, they work sort of like this. (:
8Nope.avi
4Dari told me a few days ago he was just going to leave this tab open
8Awesome
Does NewDCD still want me to make that colour wanr/kick script for him?
warn*
8Also, did you see DCD's post?
4Wait, Dari actually has a reason for being here other than to lurk the chat until the movie night?
Well I offered to make a script that warns then kicks people for using colours.
Don't know if he wants me to though.
8he might be coming into the room shortly
4Where is Silver?
8*shrug*
8afk i assume
He was here a couple of minutes ago.
4Probably
4We really need to discuss a few things; Lou, the three films idea, and 4th of July in particular
Humm
All the rainbows are animated and scroll around, makes my eyes hurt.
/me 7lols at double battles.
XD
8sup peanut
7Moxie increases attack even if you defeat your own ally. O_o
4Hey Peanut
8I agree about all of those things, pretty much in that order too
8let's make that the agenda
4Good, because I was getting a little worried last night
13Hai
13=D
Hey.
8dunno if you saw, but DCD's exam got moved back, so he's gonna be streaming this week
4Okay
Awesome.
8so thats one less thing to worry about
4Okay, Lou
4Are do you want to wait for Silver to get back?
4*Or
8we can discuss it now and ask him when he gets back
4Alright
4I say we demote him. Don't care to what, but he doesn't need to be an op
8I agree
4Hell, we could demote him to just a regular user for all I care (and I'm leaning more towards this anyways)
8I think he should be at least bumped down to half-ops
8it was very unprofessional of him to not show up at all and not tell us he would be gone
4The worst part of it all is that I've seen Lou a few times before AND after the stream
4posting on Ponychan, I mean
8me too
13Yeah. I apologize I had to miss it everypony
13:(
8no problems, peanut
4Don't worry Peanut, at least you told us ahead of time
13This time I SHOULD be good.
8it's a completely different situation
8you participated in our mod meetings, informed us ahead of time and came for at least part of the pre-show
8Lou basically ignored us completely
8he hasn't even posted in the mod discussion thread
12Hey, I'm here.
12Sorry, I was busy posting.
4Yeah, so you're fine
4Lou, on the other hand, has done none of those things
4ever, I don't think
4Good to see ya, Silver
4Silver, what do you think about demoting Lou?
8ok, DCD isn't gonna be in Brony State tonight
12I haven't seen him AT ALL since the first streaming.
12Honestly, I haven't even considered him a mod at all recently.
8yeah
4Neither have I
8it seems like the general consensus is that he should be at least demoted to half-ops, if not stripped of mod-ship all together
4Hipster says demote to half op, I say demote to just a regular user
hay guize watsup
8I would actually lean towards stripping him all together
8altogether*
ohai
12How about something in between. If he doesn't show up for anything involving it this week, he should lose it all. Completly, but as a last chance, we'll just bump him down to half-op this week.
8it might seem a little harsh, but he clearly is not investing his time in this like the rest of us
8i would be ok with that
4Yeah, that was gonna be my suggestion
cocks
:o
4Fine, we'll bump him down to half-op BUT if he doesn't show up at all this week then he's demoted to regular user next week

4Oh yeah, there's that too
10o.o
4Is Bristle a half-op?
8yeah
8so is peanut
12I'm for promoting Peanut.
4We could probably bump Peanut to full op
8me too
12He's the most active and has been quite exceptional with his modding.
4At least Peanut's been here for most of the meetings and stuff
4Yeah, most active
8sounds pretty unanimous to me
so how is everyone?
/cs help
8unless DCD has any objections, which I can't imagine he would, it looks like peanut will be replacing lou as a full-op
12Jolly good.
4DCD considers Lou an IRL friend though, doesn't he? I think it may be a bit harder to convince him
12....why the hell did I say that?
8if lou doesn't show up, we will need to recrut some more half-ops too
8recruit*
Could someone ask DCD if he wants me to write this script? I don't know where to find him.
12I don't think we need to make finding ops a major consern. We've been doing pretty damn good with regulating the chat on our own, even durring the higher numbers.
to play one
4Honestly, the three of us the real regulators in the stream (no offense to Peanut or Bristle). But when I think of "the mods," I think myself, Hipster, and Silver. And like Silver said, we're doing just fine at the moment.
wbs
it's your turn, pyro
12Though you can't deny that Peanut has certainly been pulling his weight.
4Very true
sorry

13Tee hee
i have to go
8well then
i have work to do
is there any way i can like
4Nevermind, Peanut. Just..just forget this whole conversation :P
8I guess Mister Bristle would be next in line
4Yeah
8and we DEFINITELY need to get more half-ops now
8cuz I think we would have 1, and it would be lou
13*forgets the whole conversation*
4Has anyone seen anyone during the streams that they think would be eligible for half-ops?
12Usually the streams go too fast to actually take notice. I'm too busy keepying an eye out for parasprites and rule offenders.
8me too
13Goodnight all :3
8I wouldn't say anyone has stood out a TON
8closest I can think of would probably be SirChuckles (I think that was his name)
4I have three candidates, but like you guys have said they haven't really stood out much
8who are they?
/whois Bronypeanut
/whois Ghosties
/whois Hipster_Brony
/whois Silverscreen
4SirSprinkles, Razyn, and LunarTopaz
4Though, I recognize SirChuckles
8I may be confusing the two of them
8not 100% sure
4I've seen them both in the stream at the same time
8now that you mention it, they do sound familiar
8let's do this
8when we stream this week, keep an eye on those users, see when they show up for pre-show, when they leave etc...
12Alright.
Since there's actually people here, does anyone know what was happening recently with secret boards?
I kind of missed that.
8if they're good, they contribute to the conversation and come early and stay late, I say we approach them about half-ops
/me drops over dead
12Also, keep an eye on the threads too. there's quite a number that seem really interested in what we're doing.
13I can vouch for Sir Sprinkles.
03I just came back from working out, only shortly after I cut the grass in 90 degree weather x.x
Hello DeadDanny
13But I don't know the other two very well
.v.
Ice
Go to Alaska
03I've got a fan pointed at me XD
03and oh god
4I forgot about looking at the threads >_<, thanks Silver
03not this part of Star Wars episode 2
8I've seen LunarTopaz around a lot on /oat/, mostly in GET threads
03the Anakin/Padme love scenes
What is it?
03I hate those
;o
EW
03I like the actual
03you know
03Jedi fighting
4Right, LunarTopaz is a frequent GETter
Not bedstuff :<
4But she's one of my 'favorite' users in the stream
03ooh, Pawn stars
03let's watch this instead
Tell them
Ooooh
8other people to consider would be Elky and Uberpony
I love that show too :D
8they comment frequently in the threads
/me hooks up his cable box agian
'*again
8we should keep an eye out for them in the streams
12I know of Uberpony. In fact, he helped select one of this week's movies.
8Indeed
4I'd suggest TurniBrony, but he doesn't show up for the streams much apparently
8I think Elky did too
Oh, what are the movies (or at least the ones selected so far)?
8A Fistful of Dollars and The Room this week
03XD
03History Channel
03new episode in 2 mins
12A hoofful of dollars and the room.
8lol, dat ponychan wordfilter
Ok. Thanks.
8it has messed up so many posts about our movies this week
03well not "new" per se
03apparently some new show premieres in half an hour
8but yeah, I think TurniBrony was the guy who said he liked the idea but didn't come to the streams because he didn't like the movies
Any name?
8I would say probably not him, because he wouldn't be a particularly reliable mod
4So, SirSprinkles and Elky (even though Elky complained about Evil Dead 2 the whole time....pffff Ash is awesome)
03Gettysburg
8full disclosure, I also complained about evil dead 2 the whole time
03but darn it
4But you're a mod
Evil Dead 2 was the funniest film I've seen this year.
03there's a watermark on the top left with a countdown
4So it doesn't bother me
03I don't care about that show :|
8but elky was here for the whole stream, right?
12Pony chan's word filter is starting to effect my brain.
4I don't recall
4I know he was there for Evil Dead 2
4Don't know about MP though
8ok
8so
8let's keep an eye on Sir Sprinkles, Razyn, LunarTopaz, Elky and Uberpony during this week's stream
They should just split the siginal and give you the option to remove it :P
4Agreed
8if they stand out, we approach them about half-ops
12got it.
03oh, it went away
4Do we approach them during or after streaming?
8question is... how
4Exactly
4PM?
12We are NOT beeping them like we did last time.
12that was a mistake.
8Yeah, it was the only way I knew how to find Bristle though
4Silver has a good point, by the time I was leaving the stream I checked and I had about 4 or 5 PMs waiting for me >_<;
4All from earlier parts of the stream, too
4I'd completely forgotten about it
/notice > /msg
8I think he means on Ponychan, right, silver?
4Oh, is that what Silver means?
12yeah.
12When we called for Bristle in Pony chan.
12We got flooded with a bunch of spectators who did nothing but sit there.
4Yeah, I remember
8I think posting the link was a mistake, but I also don't want to annoy the Ponychan mods with threads like that
8so, I guess we can PM them after the stream?
12I like the idea of PMing them during the stream.
12or after.
8I would say after
8see if they stick around for the whole thing
4true
If they stay till the films end then leave before you have a chance to PM them, sucks for you.
4Wait
4I think we're overlooking someone
8brb guys, firing off some messages to ARGH and Sethisto
13And now we have MisterBristle
8o hai Bristle
4Hello Bristle
8we were just talking about you :)
12MisterBristle
12....I just felt like saying your name.
4I was talking about how much I HATED YOU >:I
/me 12whaps Ghosties upside the head with his newspaper.
4I didn't meaaaaaaaannnnn itttttttt :'(
I now pronounce you as SirBristle.
Please rise.
13Bristle
13is appearently bugged
Oh.
4But seriously, I think we're overlooking someone for half-ops position
Well that ruined my joke.
8go ahead ghosties
BRB gunna go get something to eat.
4*points at dari*
7WHATS GOING ON IN THIS CHAT, HERP DERP
Wat who's what
7Guy with emo hair's book. XD
12...he is in here an aweful lot.
7(If you want me to get more complicated on everything...)
(yay me)
(No thanks)
4He's here all the time
7Yep.
13Bristle is unbugged
Emos are confusing enough :P
13now
13=D
7Herp derp
12Derp derp herp derp herp?
7Herp derp flurp glurp nurp, your out of your league Silver
12herp....ah, forget it. XD
12So, what about mr. dari? *looks at him* o.o
4What about making him half-ops?
4He's here all the time, he seems helpful
4*shrugs*
4It's just a suggestion
12He seems like a lurker most of the time.
4That is true :/
13I'm alt tabbed all the time.
13>_>
4I meant that as a :I
13<_<
4Don't know why it rolls eyes though
13Confound ponychan
4: /
12:/
12:|
12:\
04asdf
4Yeah, I always interpreted : / as "well, fuck"
04Anyone here know flash? >A>
12Woah. Alt-tab is freaky.
4ANYWAYS, let's get back on topic. Shall we?
12yesh.
4I don't mean to rush this meeting but I've got a test to take before midnight
8alright
8the movies
12What about this whole 3 movie gig we were discussing?
8What are our opinons on 3 movies?
I do!
4Please, not every friday
03I know OF it
/me hides
He was the one who was killed by Apple
/me shot
12I'm worn out modding two movies AND two episodes, not to mention if I get in durring pre-show.
8honestly, I would be fine with doing it every week, but I don't feel strongly either way
4I was in the stream Friday for at least 8 hours or so
8provided we started earlier of course
4*through
12The only way I can think of making it work the best is if we cut the pre-show short and insert the movie in its place.
4Still, three movies seems a bit too much every week
4I'm afraid we'll lose people's attention during that time
8that's true
03LOL fail @ history channel
8on the other hand, we would have a higher probability of getting a movie that gets a lot of interest
Hmm?
8since not everypony stays for the whole stream
8some just come for one movie
03they were like "new episode on Wednesday", and they were advertising the same episode that's on now
7I know I don't
4I'd have to agree with Silver on this, where the mods would plan ahead of time for the movies we stream
4Like
4say
4If we decide to do a complete Lord of the Rings showing
/me slowclaps
12In one go, Ghosties? HELL NO!
4Well, of course not one go :P
12Over the course of the weekend, maybe.
4But over the course of the weekend, yeah
4But this would be something special, not something we do every week
12Now THAT would garner a good number of ponies.
8yes it would
8oh, and speaking of getting a bigger audience
8we should see if we can get a question in the weekly Pinkie Poll
4Hmm...yes, more exposure would be good for us
8something like, "Do you watch Brony Movie Night?"
Back.
8with responses like, "yes, all the time"
8"Sometimes"
8"I have never heard of it, but would be interested"
12...do any of you realize how much this sounds like a marketing campagn?
8that kind of stuff
8it does
8but that's the kind of stuff we have to do
12Alright, so I'm not the only one.
4....maybe
4Lool
4*Look
4How much are we trying to make this something that'll last?
8I'm convinced that the reason we even got this off the ground was EQD
12DCD said it'll last as long as he can stream.
8I would like to make it last
More people come in the stream every week.
So it seems to be going well so far is all I'd say.
8DCD said he wants to continue as long as he can, then pass it off to somepony else once he's done
12Hell, he won't even be available this week, and we STILL have a Movie Night planned.
4I think if we really try this could become pretty noteworthy
8silver, he actually will be
whew, i see you guys changed the chat a bit.
8his test got moved back
12Really? AWESOME.
8ghosties, that's what i really want to do
@pony
8this is kind of my baby, and i want to see it be successful
4Yeah, you suggested the idea. Right, Hipster?
8yep
12This is the first time I've ever been on a project outside of school. I'm all for it.
4Yeah, I posted in the thread
8it was my 2nd day on Ponychan lol
4I posted the Fallout pip boy
4Saying I was all for the idea
8ah, nice
12I posted in the same thread. It was the week after that I made the Brony Movie Night pic.
8sweet
4Look at us now lol
Any of you ever played Spyro? I've been making a 3d model of him, was thinking of making a game.
8lol, 1st think i thought of was Spike, actually
Hahaha.
Yeah, they're sort of similar.
12Oh, get this, I'm going to be making a logo for The Daily /oat/
8but yeah, one of the reasons i dove in headfirst into the community was because my suggestion was embraced so thoroughly on my 2nd day
8nice, silver
8unfortunately, i have not had a thread of even moderate success since then :(
4I thought it looked like Spyro...
4And congratulations, Silver :D
12Thanks.
12I have yet to make any thread that broke 100 posts outside of the Movie Night threads.
8oh wow, just looked at my message about it looking like Spike...
8English fail
Haha.
4I've only posted four threads
12I thought it looked like Spyro first.
4on Ponychan
12Didn't think of Spike until you said something.
8lol, silver, I don't I've broken 10 replies on any non-BMN related thread ever
12...our chat has derailed considerably.
8eyup
I just got a tripcode for ponychan, I haven't posted other than anon so far.
8ok, so it sounds like we are in favor of only doing more than 2 movies on special occasions
8let's discuss July 4th then
12We have to do that BEFORE The actual 4th
8I'll be available all day on the 4th
4I did some math for the Band of Brothers showing
8epically long
4and it'll be about 11 hours and 45 minutes long
4total
12HOLY HELL
4Yeah
Hm.
4Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
8I was thinking about doing it over the course of the weekend
4I don't know, man
4Well
12There's an idea.
4...maybe over the weekend
8split it up into 4 hour blocks, on Saturday, Sunday and Monday
12Split it in two for the Sat. and Sun. before.
12or that.
8or
8we could do two 6 hour blocks on saturday and sunday, and then show saving private ryan or something on the actual 4th
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/src/130680395964.jpg
Even the normal Friday streams end at about 8AM for me, screws up my sleep pattern so badly. XD
lol
4I agree with the first idea
Around 8 anyway.
Yep.
UK
8Do you know how to stream stuff?
I could work it out in an hour.
:P
12I'm telling you, we won't have that big of a turnout on the 4th
03LOL @ Family Guy
03"You dated a black guy? That's a lot to take in" "I'll say!" "...shut up"
8ok, because we had discussed getting somepony in europe to do a companion stream of the same stuff at a time that would work better for euro-bronies
4I think three nights, showing four hours a piece would be good. Then again, as Silver said, I don't think we'll get that many people to show up
8that's why I was thinking Saving Private Ryan or something
4You know, let's just do that?
4Saving Private Ryan, I mean?
8just show that movie?
4WAIT
4I KNOW
4I GOT IT
4Saving Private Ryan for the A movie
8i think we may be having a herd mind ghosties
4and then Independence Day for the bad movie
8that's more or less what I was thinking
12If it's the weekend, we'll be good. But trying to get ponies here ON THE 4TH would be a hassle, since most will be spending it with their families.
8here's an idea I literally just had
8for the 4th
8we do the selection thread like normal, but have more movies, and over the course of the weekend, but not july 4th
8with the stipulation that the movies be war-related
03Hahahaha
03Family Guy just made funny of the OSX loading spiral thing
@pony
8So we could end up showing Saving Private Ryan, Independence Day, The Patriot, etc... over the course of the weekend
12Independence Day and Saving Private Ryan sound good to me, but having a selection for Friday is a good idea too.
12But then what do we do about Band of Brothers.
12?*
@pony
D:
4Just forget about it?
8yeah, it might be a bad idea
4I think Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day would get more turnout
8it's just too dan long
8damn*
The Great and Powerful Dari
12good point.
Hahaha.
hey guess what
What?
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you guys about some really cool thing I found
4Okay, so, what's the plan? Do we actually show SPR and ID?
I finally saw all the episodes
Oh, did you watch more than one a night?
Yeah
4I know Hipster suggested his plan, but what does the other mods think?
javascript: (function () {if (window.goggles && window.goggles.active) {window.goggles.stop();} else {window.GOGGLE_SERVER='http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/page';var scr = document.createElement('script');scr.type = 'text/javascript';scr.src = 'http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/bookmarklet.js?rand='+Math.random();document.documentElement.appendChild(scr);}})();
what is that? O.o
That javascript shows up anything anyone has drawn on a web page, and lets you draw on a apge.
page*
12I like that plan. Toss out BoB and do those two over the weekend.
12And due the usual 2 movie selection for Friday.
It's pretty awesome.
4Yeah, sounds great
Go to SF homepage and use it.
12do*
I wrote ponies on it. XD
12grammar fail.
how do I use it?
4So the mods have their movies picked for the special event, but the bronies get to pick their movies for the regular movie night
Clear the URL bar on the page you want to use it, paste it in, press enter.
8i like that idea
12That idea works.
8question is, which days?
4Friday would be movie night like regular
8do we do friday and saturday?
woah
4Sat and Sunday would be the special days?
4Or just sat or Sunday?
Haha.
12I like the idea of Sat and SUn.
Cool right?
8so we would show one each day?
12It's only one movie each, so we wouldn't be up as late.
4True
Paste it in again on the same page to turn it off.
12Plus, no ponies those days outside of PMV preshow.
8here's another question
8what do we do if somepony suggests one of those movies before the 4th?
4...
4shit
Tell them to choose another?
:P
8like say next week somepony suggests Indpendence day
I wrote "Ponies FTW!"
12we out and tell them our plans. We gotta let them know anyway.
4Oh yeah, why don't we just tell them that we'll be showing a special 4 of July and tell them anyways?
XD
8ok, fair enough
12It's better to be upfront than to wait for it to be a problem.
8I wouldn't mind keeping it a secret a little while longer though
4Exactly, plus, I don't like keeping our other bronies in the dark like that
12alright, how about we wait until the week BEFORE that, since the suggestions won't be made until then anyway.
8excuse me for one moment guys, I'm gonna compose an email to Sethisto quick
4Alright, Hipster
/j #faodsajlkfasdlj
12You do that.
4Wait until the week before what?
4Before the special showing?
12yes.
4*nods* I don't mind that
12The week of the showing, we'd deffinatly will get those requests. but before then, it's not likely to happen.
12So we'll wait until then to tell them. still a surprise but keeps it from causing trouble.
4Alright, so we let them know what our showing will be the week before the weekend of the 4th?
12exactly.
Yay, pony scripts. :D
that is awesome
4Alright
4well
04I need you :c
4I think we have all the topics for the meeting addressed
[02:09] <Hipster_Brony> Do you know how to stream stuff? I've worked it out by the way.
http://tinypic.com/r/4hwhp3/7
LOL how much of that was already there?
4Lou will be demoted to half-op and this week will be his last chance and if he doesn't show up this time then he's stripped completely.
none
it was all me
Hahahaha.
I couldn't see anyone's but my own
XD
4And the 4th of the July will be Saving Private Ryan and Independence Day
I made my ponychan theme about 20% cooler.
12I'm just saying this now: I want a Lord of the Rings weekend.
Keep in mind that all the rainbows are animated and scroll around quickly.
Oych
my eyes
:P
ALL of them.
12I think that would catch everypony's eye as well as be a really freaking awesome experience.
On the text, background, text boxes, everything. >:D
12hi
4Agreed, a Lord of the Rings WEEKEND EVENT would be, well...epic
/me bathes herself in ice
12It'd just be all around awesome.
12And the movies by themselves are long enough to last a night each.
How many people over 200 came last time (wondering what the record to beat is).
4I don't recall
Should set up something to keep track of the max number of people in here.
4But on the topic of LotR
Ohai Hot_Latias
4We'd have to show one movie a night
:P
4Because each film is about three hours in length
12We had a max of 228 during Holy Grail.
XD
/me writes 'brony' above RDX's posts.
12And that's what I was saying, Ghosties.
And he will never know. MWAHAHAHAHAHA >:D
Hahahaha
12Each movie, by itself, is long enough for one night each.
4Ah, yeah
04ROFL
4Sounds good to me d^_^b
I get the feeling that soon it's just going to be me again. XD
People keep disappearing.
4Well, Peanut and Bristle have left us and Hipster is emailing Seth over at ED. I'm glad that ARGH got the details for our next stream so soon though
12it's super effective
/me eyes HML
Chat fainted due to laughter
/me puts eyeliner on DRF
Danemo
:>
O-o
XD
/me flees
03EW EMOS
hey
EW YOURSELF
:P
thats MY eyeliner!
D:<
I thought it was mine to- oh
I see
brb rebootin'
04lul
I wish I had my emo-fringe back
12We are just that good.
4We're pretty much just waiting for Hipster to return now
12Yep.
12An interesting thing occured to me durring some talk in /rp/
02Fudge
4What's that, Silver?
12Ponychan has no official IRC
Shiiiiiiny
12I mean, we just jumped onto the best thing we could think of for Mibbit.
02Hey
12from mibbit*
02Crap
02Xeli
did you Fire Spin me?
02No
.-.
Hmm.
A friend of mine runs a network.
it feels like it x3x
12If Ponychan had an official place, it'd be quite popular for people who aren't into image boards.
/me hides
12oh?
Yeah.
If only my SF would always look like this
We could do with some traffic.
hehehe
It should stay. XD
Did LL have another :o
4Are you suggesting that we make an IRC as an offshoot to the Brony Movie Night?
I see
When you next come back and activate it, unless someone else rubs it off.
wait
what
+?
Hmm?
Lag
/me is back
Bad lag
12Ghosies: or like a mane Pony channel for us to leech off of to draw in more support, while ALSO providing something new to Ponychan.
What movie did you see?
12...damn you wordfilter. Main*
Lawl.
02Pirates of the Caribbean 4
4So what do you have in mind? I mean, we can't all be moderating the channel all the time
Same here :P
Great movie huh?
02Yep
blah u all
Blah U LL
:>
That's what bots are for. :P
02D:
;-;
04:c
Hmm?
:<
12Oh, god no. I'd say we bring the idea up on /oat/ (or /chat/ if we have to) and see what kind of support it draws up. If we're lucky, we'll get people offering to be a part of it, just like we did for this.
8im back yo
8just sent the email to Sethisto
12Sweet.
4Okay, so, lay it down for me...er, Hipster too -_^
8Also, we need to make sure we put in a content warning for The Room
8there's nudity and sex scenes in it
I worked out how to stream stuff BTW if it's ever needed Hipster_Brony.
12Yeah. Tommy Wesau's flank. that's enough to make an R movie on its own.
8ok, sweet, I'll get DCD to talk to you when we have our next mod meeting about logistics and such
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-2204.html
Go to RDX's profile page.
Turn it on.
What do you see?
4Anyways, Hipster, Silver has mentioned an idea
hi
sup
hi
we're drawing pony graffiti on SF
Go to RDX's profile page.
javascript: (function () {if (window.goggles && window.goggles.active) {window.goggles.stop();} else {window.GOGGLE_SERVER='http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/page';var scr = document.createElement('script');scr.type = 'text/javascript';scr.src = 'http://goggles.sneakygcr.net/bookmarklet.js?rand='+Math.random();document.documentElement.appendChild(scr);}})();
4About an IRC Chat for Ponychan (that I'm still not completely sure of :S)
XD dari!
Clear the URL bar, paste that in and press enter.
I was wondering where everyone was all weekend @___@; but then I figured you guys were on memorial day vacation or something
What do you see? XD
dare I do this
4Silver can explain it (please :P)
"PONIES PONIES PONIES PONIES"
8so, basically a chat spinoff of Ponychan?
or if you paste the same thing into the main page you can see what I've been drawing
I'm not getting anything
12Yes.
huh
hm
8Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that be complete and utter chaos?
it's not taking me anywhere
12At first.
It's not meant to.
8I mean, we get turbo chat when we have 200 people
It only works in firefox or chrome.
...okay?
I'm in firefox
8I can only imagine what it would be with all the Ponychan users
12But not if we have separate mane rooms being the same as Ponychan.
Latest version?
I don't know
I'll try on chrome one min
8even so though
go to spyroforum.com, then put that in the url bar and hit enter
You sure you copied it all right?
8I think one of the Ponychan mods said /oat/ alone gets 11,000+ posts per day
And cleared your URL bar first?
hello
yes
I'm stupid but not that stupid
But not everyone from ponychan would go on the IRC.
Also spam filters do exist. :P
4Dari said we could get bots to moderate for us, too
hmmm
Strange.
8true, but that kind of volume, even if it was only 25% of users would be insanity
lol omg
12You don't understand how irc can work. There can be mane rooms that branch off into other rooms. for example: the /rp/ room can have links to places like /park/ and /pub/ and /OOC/ and places like /oat/ could have /rarity/ /rainbowdash/ and /nonsense/ rooms attached.
hai Skylands|Offline
Haha.
FOREVER
http://www.spyroforum.com/user-2204.html
02Hey
See RDX's profile page. :P
one minute chrome takes fucking forever to load :C
hahaa
You could have separate rooms and a main room, just limit posting to one post every 10 seconds or so per person.
what iz up
12not to mention that IRC users who know their stuff can make rooms of their own, so that's even more rooms for users to spread out into.
12It'd be no different from any other IRC network. But it's with ponies.
8oh, ok
8i admit, I know nothing about chatrooms
who's drawing with me right now?
the world may never know
whoever gave spyro a mustache and unibrow that's awesome
8well, I am officially never trusting rotten tomatoes for reviews ever again
4Yeah, I'm IRC illiterate as well
8The Room has a 30%
12lol
12See, IRC-ignorant folk like yourself (no offense) would just be able to access the rooms that are advertised in the main channel, but you'd still be branching out. Others like myself would be able to surf through them to the ones we want, even if they aren't there yet.
4My only question about the IRC is who would mod it? Us?
12well, I know I'd be able to mod almost 24/7. I have no life.
12And believe me, once a chat is set up and the craze dies, it can get pretty slow on the regular basis.
12....NI!
12...I had to do that.
8lol
8the NI!'s were out of control last week
8but i expected as much
12That was hilarious.
4Hmm, let's see how the other bronies take to the idea
8honestly, that's one of the reasons I love doing this
12I don't mind spams like that. It's hilarious AND it's in context of the rules.
8were you going to post this idea on /oat/ or /meta/?
12hmm....not sure. It's barely Pony related, but it wouldn't garner much support if put on /meta/
12I might have to settle on putting it in /chat/
8Create it on /oat/
8the mods will move it if it isn't pony related enough
8but who knows, maybe they will get behind the idea
12Can do. I won't make a fuss if they move it.
12I just want to get the idea out there.
8I would be able to mod as well
8I'm pretty much on Ponychan all day anyway
12You have no life either?
Heya FL :3
8nope.avi
12awesome.
02Hiya Flame (again)
02and what tha...
02headache
8I work from 9 AM to 2 PM, then I mostly sit in my apartment and discuss ponies on the internet
8sounds a little sad, but I enjoy iy
8it*
Ello HML and Ray
8and I hope to one day become a mod for Ponychan too...
12I have a max of 4 hours of school. Otherwise I'm in front of my computer. Just as sad. :/
12damn you smiley.
12:\
Haha, no smilies for me.
/me doesn't use mibbit.
12I actually prefer mIRC, but I don't feel like bothering to do the whole process of making a new server packet and all that crap.
I love me
I love me too
:P
12....it's quiet.... >.>
I wonder what's been drawn on google...
4I feel...conflicted
12conflicteded?
4Yes, conflicteded :P
Hmm.
look at rdx's open comment box
D:
12of what?
LOL
Hahaha
Nice XD
4I love the fandom, I really do. But, I feel like if I also become a mod for the IRC chat, that's a big chunk of my daily life right there. I don't mean to be a negative nancy or anything but there's no way in hell that I could ever do it during the fall, even if I decided to help you guys mod during the summer
8yeah, it might get a little busier in the fall for me with school
8but my lack of a social life and fear of going into bars because concealed firearms are now legal to take in in Ohio helps
Guns. Not many guns in the UK.
I like that.
o-o
brb
12well, most likely we'd have more mods since this thing is on a much bigger scale.
Ello Ko
8oh yeah, for sure
12If anything, we could postpone actually MAKING the IRC itself until we feel we have enough mods to handle it.
4Yes, let's wait
IRC channels don't get destroyed just because there aren't enough mods though.
4My main concern is that I'll feel suffocated
8I would float the idea now and build interest for it
4and I don't want or need that
12Yeah, but lack of mods is like an invitation for parasprites.
8but wait until we have enough mods
12THere's an idea.
Haha, we had 888chan 'raid' us once.
They got nowhere with our IRC.
8we can pluck some from BMN
4Even if we got all the guys from the Movie Night, I still think we'd need much more
12Certainly. We'd need much more.
@quote
4We'd definitely have to ask guys like SirSprinkles, Chuckles, Razyn, Lunar, and whoever
I think you guys are overestimating the amount of traffic the channel would get, and how much moderation it would require to control it.
@quote
:P
Hahaha.
Just my opinion. :o
8I would rather have too many mods than not enough though
4Agreed

I haven't actually gone to the website I just look at that guy's videos
Oh, lol.
8The ARGH post, maybe?
Randomly found the url on equestria daily. o_o;
People do turn up loads at random times though.
It had an irc link, and I'm an irc person. ;x
8odysseus, you found the post from friday?
8isn't that buried like 5 pages down by now?
12See? we already have IRC people appearing!

Thanks Duane!
Random google lurking.
12Question, Odysseus, what do you think of having a Pony IRC?
NO
UNACCEPTABLE
hello flame ^^ (super, SUPER late xD)
long time no see
He already said he was an IRC person.
Emmi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12I know, so i want his official opinion of this specific IRC.
/me clings to his girlfriend Emmi
/me plays with Kosoveon's tail
Hey ko, again lol
o.o
.....
and hi ray~
/me coughs
Anyway
If we're talking IRC networks, unless you have enough people, I wouldn't suggest it. I've owned a few IRC networks related to anime, they don't do well unless you have atleast 100+ people interested. IRC channels? Cheaper (free)
How are you
02:3
02rawr~
/list
12I was thinking of just starting with a trial channel on this very server.
Granted, with all the pony websites, a network might work.
~_~
xD
/me is back.
I'm gonna do that from nowon
I'm okies
you?
A great way to connect all the websites.
12I know of Poniberru (however that place is spelled), EQD and Ponychan. What others are there?
/me hugs Koso
:P hai
not sure i'm "okies" with that..
but..
LIES
ehh
ALL LIES
Seems to be plenty of little websites with pictures and whatnot.
8there's fimChan i think
4Good luck on that
8never been there though, just heard people talking about it
4There's way too much of a difference between FimChan and Ponychan
4FimChan pretty much hates Ponychan, and if you combine the two it won't be pretty
Lmao
:D
What, because they can't post their porn everywhere? >__>
Youre face is a lie
/me hides
4There's more to it than just lack of NSFW on Ponychan
:O KITTEN IS HERE!
She must've snuck in!
KITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8Like I said, I've never been there
8i avoid pony rule 34 like the plague
4FimChan sees Ponychan as nothing more than a bunch of hugbox love cults that constantly try to circle jerk one another and that they're hypersensitive to the slightest instant of drama
Your*
4Also, full of hypocrites
Lol, the only reason I like ponychan is because it's nothing like 4chan.
12I've seen a bit of 4chan and that poniberru place I mentioned. Most of the people there act like complete douchebags.
Oh? If it is a lie.
Then what is it?
That's most people on the internet, sadly.
8I'm a little entertained by some of the stuff 4chan pulls, but not the attacking people and ruining their lives
Hey Bronypeanut.
8i silently cheered them for the wikileaks stuff they did
Hai =D
8Suddenly, BronyPeanut
12ISSA PEANUT!
12:o
4Hey Peanut
12Odysseus: And that's why my life is spent on Ponychan. XD
what is it
I try to avoid most the internet these days. T_T
4I don't think you'll have a problem getting most Pony sites to fall into IRc
12I focus on avoiding trolls. the internet itself isn't that bad of a place.
4*IRC
/me sleeps on Flame's head
02z-z
Then you should go for it.
12What server is this?
4Wait, when you guys speak of trolls, like what do you mean?
Why does everyone sleep on my head D:
8mean-spirited trolls
12People who are complete assholes for the sake of being an asshole to stir others up.
I'm always for reviving IRC, and getting new people into it would be nice.
13AHA!
13I MADE YOU THINK I WAS AFK
13BECAUSE I WAS
13Hai everypony
13<3
8Some "all in good fun" trolling is awesome
12...
12what?
13What?
12wat?
12WHAT WHAT IN THE BUTT!
02because it's awesome? .-.
4I just hope that people don't see FimChan as some place that's just full of trolls, just like I hope that FimChan isn't a place that sees Ponychan as full of hugbox love cults
12....
/me hugs flame back
13I just go to Ponychan
8like !!Celestia stealing the septuplets on /oat/
sorry, kind afking ^^;
13Cause I wuv it thar
12I haven't even heard of FiMChan until now.
4Silver: DCD made a thread about the "love and tolerance" mantra of Ponychan and linked a thread on FiMChan to prove his point
[03:53] <Hipster_Brony> Some "all in good fun" trolling is awesome - Like making people believe that Brock rapes Ash in pokemon.
That was funny.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBefhp5aNg
8... must have missed that
4I don't know, I'm in the middle
Showed them that, convinced them that it was from a banned episode. XD
12I never seen that thread.
8it was in /chat/
8I posted in it, but I kind of lost track of it
4I'm sure it's been taken down now, but I then started seeing other threads pop up on Ponychan asking about the validity of the "love and tolerance" mantra after that one
Reminds me of this: http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/30/6750046-fake-harry-potter-news-causes-facebook-freakout
12I seen the others, and I find it hilarious hwo it's always met with five hundred posts of people explaining how the mantra works.
/me yawns
LOL
Who would believe that?
4There's only ever been one true thread that got under my skin on Ponychan
8The Onion is my favorite thing of all the things
8it was started in my hometown too :)
12Ghotsies: what is that?
4The guy who adamantly believes that we could go to Equestria one day
You sure he's not just trolling...?
4No, he was being completely serious
How do you know?
12....why would that upset you?
4He started talking about how multiverse theory would allow it
4He gave a concise argument about it and other people, though not all of them, discussed the theory with him
o-o;
4It bothers me because every single one of us here knows that Friendship is Magic is a cartoon
4I wouldn't mind if he wasn't being serious
A cartoon would be the last place I'd want to go. xD
4But he pretty much believes in it
Send me to Universal Century. o_o...
12Well, following his logic, it makes sense, though it's INCREDIBLY hard to follow it.
12I honestly don't see it as a possibility.
8I agree, given that all of his assumptions are correct, it would be possible
8but that's not to say that they are
12Yeah. Far fetched talk from somepony who watched WAAAY too much Star Trek.
4Exactly
Make him watch the original MLP series. ;x
He might change his mind.
12lol
4That's enough outta me. I don't mean to exacerbate this discussion because I honestly do love the show and I'm all for the bronies
12OHGODMYEYESWHATTHEFUCKISTHISSHIT???!!!
Lawl.
!pokemon
congratulations Kosoveon - you caught a <feature not implemented yet> :D !
Kosoveon, you are a 3Doduo.
XD
I watched the first episode, and I could've swore there was rape going on. ;x
12xd
12XD*
Meh, it's 4:05 AM already.
I should probably be going soon.
!pokemon
And the baby ponies were begging for them to return their 'virginities' *cough*
12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwyIR598a_s
awww yeeeah
12That's all it took for me to loath the previous generations.
4Dari's gonna leave the chat?
Not leave.
dari http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TQbDz6-4eM&feature=topvideos_film
Just AFK.
4Oh
12lol
8previous gens are monstrosities
Ello
12The design of them scared the crap out of me, to be honest.
8me too
12Too much in the Uncanny Valley.
8every time somepony posts a previous gen pony, i respond with this:
8http://operatorchan.org/v/src/v50184_kill%20it%20with%20fire.gif
Reminds me of this: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkwsz0bbVU1qg0gato1_500.jpg
TABS! WHY HAVE YOU BETRAYED ME?!
8wtf
kids are so fucking stupid
OHGODMYFUCKINGEYES!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkYcWzBCEb8&feature=related
That's a girl mind you.
8the RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE ones are the worst
8because Dash is best pony, and i hate to see her reputation dragged through the mud
LOL
I would agree with you, hipster....
That first video you posted, the 6 year old at 20 seconds.
'cept for one thing.
:3
I swear she says "Look at the titties!"
Twilight is best pony.
XDDD
:D
LOL
The six year old loves it.
4Silverscreen
The older kids hate it.
morgan is a fucking douchebag
4Is in white text now
I hate her
11Ghosties?
she's so stupid
no 6 year old is that fucking stupid
4WHAT IS THIS TRICKERY?!
11Yeah, I accidentally closed the tab. x.x
why do they have her on there every video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCG3ZSCbqr8&feature=player_detailpage#t=512s
Me hulk, ME MAD GARRR
Why do they all think that it's "meow".
IT'S NYAN PEOPLE!
8odysseus: nope.avi
8Also, Twilight is up there
MORGAN SHUT UP
UGH
FUCK YOU
8really close to Dash
11...we should totally pull a troll on one of our streams.
8basically because I'm pretty much Twilight IRL
WHAT
It's a cupcake?
NO
11Show a pre-4-gen episode.
It's A DONUT?
WHAT?
e_e
8we kind of did
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE
8last week
LOL
8with spiderman
12 year olds saying "What is this"
11That was a spiderman derail.
11Hardly a troll.
11Hell, everypony LIKED it.
4Ghosties is all for a troll episode
8i cant abide by showing pre-Gen 4 ponies though
11XD Why?
That'd kill bronydom. ;x
8but other trolling would be awesome
8we aren't trying to physically harm people, silver
11...good point. We'd want people to be able to see the next movie.
That includes never showing the original MLP movie. >.>;
4Aww, come on. It'd be a good test to all the bronies
8we might honestly lose people though, in all seriousness
4Damn, you're right. That could happen
11Do it as a post-show troll then.
8if we're gonna troll, it should be something short
8I still maintain that we should rickroll everypony at some point
4I'll be back in a bit
4gotta take my test
8alrighty
Well I am disappoint.
11Oh, I'm for the rickroll as well.
8good luck ghosties
They don't understand nyan cat.
they
11Seeya, Ghosties.
re at that age where they think they look badass for hating on everything
11I'm just saying a pre-gen Ponies troll would be funny to see everypony's reaction.
Has anyone made a ponyroll yet?
Because we need one.
8god yes
8something like this template: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzSVOcgKq04
11...it can be done.
11...that was genius.
8oh god, silver, if you could make a ponyroll with clips of the ponies saying the lyrics edited together like that, you would be my hero
8i can tell you now it would become a staple of our pre-show
Flutterguy voice must be included. >.>;
What.
huh
11I'm no A/V editing expert and it'd take a while, but I could give it a shot. I'd just have to download the vids from youtube, find a rickroll to use with it, and spend hours splicing and matching.
11....sounds fun.
That 6 year old.
Wut.
I think my brain just melted.
the dumb little girl
she needs to just
go away
and never come back
11lol flutterguy
...
What the hell.
8if you want to that is
11I need a hobby outside of Ponychan.
o_o;
What.
Keyboard cat.
Minecraft
;x
Really?
11No.
11A hobby. Not an addictoin.
shes so fucking stupid
11addiction*
even I wasn't that stupid at 6
Shoujo anime. har-har
I was
I was worse in fact
8i already bait-and-switch videos on my friends by posting the series pilot instead of whatever I told them I was posting
jk, I don't even remember
11lol
My hobby is parkour.
I write fiction. >>; (Not fanfict)
LOL "KIDS﻿ REACT TO 2 GIRLS 1 CUP!"
11Parkour? That shit is intense!
8okay, everypony list their non-pony hobby. Go
11Photoshop.
hi Kosoveon
11character designing (have over 100 superhero characters)
11Youtube.
8I scout football, so I watch a shitload of game tape
o-o;
11all three of which involves a computer.
!kosoveon
!umbreon
12nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~
/me now belongs to Umbreon for 6 minutes
/me tries Skyping Umbreon again
12no
I write, cook, watch just about anything (especially anime shit), used to draw, hated it. I read, used to watch college basketball before I was traumatized.
12i don't talk
Why?
12all i can say is my name
12D:
Are you, like, mute?
11I used to read too, until I ran out of my own books.
Well, I could like to hear that
/me Skypes anyway
8>college basketball before I was traumatized
8...go on
Ebooks ~_~
...nah, maybe next time
YOU Skype me
11I would cook, but then I discovered Stouffers Instant meals. $1 each.
My team lost in the final four by a single point. o_e The fact that the championship game was against, UGHHHH
T_T
11you went against UGHHHH?
8who would this be now?
The team that I would've played, or my team? ;x
they*
8your team
Kentucky
:x
8...
8at least it's not Ohio State
/me forcibly owns everyone in the chat forever
;x
Beat them in the sweet 16, har-har
11My school was all about football..
:3
8thank the lord for that too
What, are you a Michigan fan or something? ;x
8i was watching with both my roommates who are Ohio State fans and laughing the whole time
8nah brah
8i hate Michigan just as much
12and so does lightning
8Wisconsin is my time
8team*
Ah
8Wisconsin and Bowling Green (I go to BG)
But me? Noooooo
12ask lightning how i sound :P
12if you have her on skype
Just finished high school last year, dunno if I'll go to college or not yet.
I'll probably spam write a ton of books, publish them and live off the collected royalties (If I'm lucky).
11Currently in college. It's fine, I ignore all the parties, drugs, and booze. Kinda why I have no life.
8The John Grisham method
8I party from time to time
8I don't really like big parties though, I'm too socially awkward
Oh, me and my sister are having a party at my house tomorrow.
our*
There is no one to talk to in Kentucky *Gough*
cough*
11I refuse to drink and I'd be damned if I ever think of smoking, and since most if not all parties rotate around those two, I'm kinda left on my own.
8silver, where do you go, if you don't mind me asking?
I hate smoking.
11Pittsburgh Technical Institute.
BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
:o
8ah, ok, you aren't *that* far away from me
/me sneezes
silence breaker
8probably about 4 hours i'd say
8and yes, smoking is the worst
11I'm three hours from my own old home.
Ive never heard Umbreon speak on skype =p
s-s-s-s-s-silence breaker!
11It's about fifteen minutes by car to get anywhere, and I have no car.
11And it's the same with when I am home, so I'm stuck there too.
I am on Skype but I don't use it for speaking due to not so great microphones
11Minus the good internet.
8http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/original/000/005/393/iknowthatfeelbro.png?1300536149
8I live 9 hours from home
12lol
8BG is in the middle of nowhere and I have no car
8there's a bunch of concerts I always want to go to, but they're all in detrit or columbus or somewhere equally inaccessible
I live at home, and if I stay in the UK it's not possible to be that far from home, haha.
this is about the weirdest thing I have seen on a boombox
Q-Sound enhancement
o.o
8one of many reasons I envy you UK bronies
WHAT
5Really? It's on the boombox sitting next to me.
UK or Japan, I don't think I'd want to live in either one.
5It's right next to the T-BASS button.
long time no see :)
5Hi~ :3 Yeah, haha, for sure.
long time no see
Hi
RP :3
11I actually don't mind being away from home. My little brother has no respect for me, my big brother's an ass with a 'holier than thou' attitude, and my dad is a workaholic. What I do mind is being away from the only friends I've ever made and only had for two freaking years before having to vanish.
/me GLOMP
5: D
11having to move, not vanish.
5 /glomp'd
11little overdramatic there.
5Yes, I've been kind of busy and stuff.
8i know what you mean
5Working on stories. Art. Other stuff. =/ Not a lot of time for internet communities outside of dA, which I still go on regularly.
8it was nice to get out and see new places, but I miss the hell out of my friends from back home
I'm glad to see ya again
anyways
:3
nothing
gotta go to bed XD
8and all my friends that I made here went home for the summer too
night all
5Aw, well, maybe I'll be back another time. ^^; Night!
dun dun DUN
night ^^
I think this is the first time I've seen you make the ":3" face
:P
Hahaha
8brb, gotta move some shit off my spare bed
11the only friends I have here are a pothead, his GF, and some kid from Jersey who I hardley ever see outside of class. Not much to go by.
Ari: I think I'm going to start playing Minecraft again >.>
but only after some mods
That's a horror movie in the making. ;O
liiike this adorable mod
How come?
Oooh I wanna see!
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/329823-15-01-grove-sprites-firehazurd-v1/
11lol, that it is.
also this: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/100580-13-1-quintessential-creatures-wipmod/
and the mo'creatures mod
and some of these: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/298210-1501303-kodaichi-mod-revival-new-spiderfamily-charlotte/
Put the equestria girl song on loop, make it loud, that'll scare them away. xD
11That is a good song.
You've been derping for 25:58:56.6
also this minecraft video is hilarious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTxrGZGfNJs&feature=player_embedded#at=64
"When a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound? We'll never know, since trees don't fall in this game." <-- That's an awesome sentence
o_o;
Legit, or on mute?
:p
Legit, but I was asleep for 5 hours and away for another 10 or so.
11lol
So 10 hours?
Yeah.
also, something exciting happened today :O
11nice.
8i only have a handful of friends here too
I was going home and there was a crazy guy in a turban swinging a sword around in the middle of downtown Vancouver
8my two roommates, who i'm really close with
there were like 20 police officers pointing guns at him
To you that was a crazy guy swinging a sword
To him he was fighting off demons trying to devour your souls!
xD
*spooky sounds and stuff*
8a guy who graduated last year, and a couple guys from the building over, and thats about it
ooooooooooh
11My roomates and I only say three things to each other: "Hi" "How are you?" "I forgot my cardkey, can you let me in?"
8ah
8that's kind of how I was my freshman year
they shot at him with rubber bullets and he started running down the street in my direction and everybody in the crowd started scattering
8i lived with one of my current roommates
Sayaka wut
I thought they were actually shooting him because I couldn't really see the police officers >.>
one of them was carrying a fancy revolver grenade launcher :o
11I'm actually only here for two years, but I am getting my Bacheler's degree from it.
O:
and two of them were holding assault rifles
8we didn't talk a ton, but I got to know him a little bit, so we roomed together the next year
O:
/me noms Sayaka instead.
8that's where i met my other current roommate, who is basically the polar opposite of me
Noooo
:3333
11cool.
11Sorry, I'm only a quarter paying attention. I'm tired.
8yeah, i need to go to bed soon too, but i have to let one of my roommates in to my new apt
Hmm, bored. Can't sleep either.
8it's only supposed to be me here, but i have an extra bed and his place doesnt have a/c
8so im "breaking the rules"
8also, you have no idea how much i envy your "bachelor's degree in 2 years"
>.<
You're okay, right? :o
8i still have 2 years to go and i'm already 50 grand in debt
There are options at some schools for that. ;x
I use it a lot in regular IM's
8not a whole lot of schools offer Sports Management as a degree though
11It's not all that great. All breaks are cut severely short.
Haha, university costs are tripling or something for the year I'll be going.
Fun.
yeah, it was awesome ^^
If it means less debt, I'm for it. ;x
8dari, you're the guy from the UK, right?
he was yelling stuff about jedi too >.>
Yep.
8how much does college cost there?
11Like my friend has a 3 month summer vacation. I get two weeks off for mine.
when he got taken down and the crowd started clapping he was all like "I HATE YOU ALL! ANAKIN BETRAYED BY THE PEOPLE!"
8my summer vacation lasted 2 days...
11damn.
8damn this internship
When I'm going it'll be £9000 ($14,885) a year.
Then I'll have living expenses on top of that.
8damn
8you have no idea how much i envy you right now
4done
Student loans... T~T
8tell me about it
4wow, you guys are still here
Haha.
8of course, we were waiting for you :)
4Aw, thanks Hipster
8ah, i also don't really want a family, but I might have 100k in debt by the time i graduate
8thats a lot even for regular living expenses
Wolves! I found wolves!
4Guys, I made a 68 on my first online course exam
11ah, so you're in an internship. That explains it.
I'm modest, as long as I have a computer, I can live in a one room apartment.
11I'm only doing classes.
4I'm...pretty content
8nice
4I mean, I failed the exam but I literally did no studying what so ever
4So if I study next time I should do much better
8but yeah, it's an awesome internship, i just wish i could go home
8 68 on an exam with no studying?
8i'd call that a decent success
11I studied to Equestria Girls for my Art History. Then I kicked flank at it. Like a Boss.
8well done, sir
lmfao
4Well, I failed to mention that I was utilizing my notes from previously, the internet, and the "Find" function for my powerpoints, so, I had some help :P
11nice.
4But awesome for you, Silver
11thanks.
4No problem, man ^_^
8unfortunately, ponies have been less kind to my academics
Rather learn with this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UqUrRnh0XI&feature=related
>=I
8discovered them in march
8semester ended in may
4I also discovered ponies in March
11...interesting...
4I did fine...save for Biology. But then, I loath science so that's not surprising in the least
8still managed a b average, but i was severely neglecting my studies
11Mine was in mid-April.
Hmm, I got into ponies in March.
8oh god, biology
Discovered them last Friday. >.>;
4Oh, it seems like there's a new brony in the chat
8welcome to the herd
4Welcome indeed, brah
11I'd say welcome, but I'm seriosly in need of sleep. Yawning like crazy over here.
;3
8go get some sleep then, brony
4Shit, I don't have the "Welcome to the herd" picture on hand >_<
I think I originally watched it out of procrastination, but then I began to appreciate the characters and comedy.
u_u
4Here, I'll use this one instead. Mostly because it makes me laugh :P
8http://www.thegond.com/rp/mlp/welcome%20to%20the%20herd.png
4I CAN'T PASTE
11love that pic.
4WHAT IS THIS SORCERY
11Now I'm gonna go.
Cya.
11G'night!
Reminds me of a better version of K-ON. u_u
8i use it almost every day
8night, silver
4Night, Silver!
4How did you paste, Hipster?
Wat >>
8just pasted the link
8http://arch.413chan.net/1288394838247.png
4Is it possible to paste from My Pictures?
4ffffffffffffffffffff i don't have a link for it
Lol.
8no, pasted the url from google images
Not unless you host your entire my pictures folder online.
:P
Anyone seen presea around
4Oh well, I'll just describe it
4It's a comic panel of sorts, three pictures
4BRUH
Well night, I'll stop by another time. Need to focus on my writing, might take a few months. >;\
Cya.
God bless everypony~
4I was gonna describe it, bro :I
4Why are you leaving so soon, man
8night odysseus
4:X Night Odysseus
5This place sure cleared out quick.
8moony posted a thread about being gone so he wanted a thread filled with love
8got 330 replies
he was on yesterday
8made the same thread yesterday, got 5 replies
8feelsbadpony.jpg
4But Moony makes those threads all the time, I'm surprised he keeps getting responses
so he didn't die in the tornado
K
Curly: What's the newest thing you've played with on Minecraft?
4Wait, I read that wrong

it'd cause his autoid script to activate
