00,10oh and i have the oav's for this
00,10the realy silly ones
I keep looking at those damn ears XD
she is full of repressed anger and her main character trait is looking at people funny
00,10is panda geting inspired to art?
How did I get in #bronystate? I clicked on #Twilight_Sparkle...
Sumica, actually yes :)
00,10you should look up more charicteres from the show then
oh?
wat anime?
TechnoColt - pony channels are closed during off hours
00,10you have only seen a few tipes so far
TechnoColt: everyone is redirected here. only during the live episodes, when 5k people are online, they get distributed over all rooms
how many different races are there Sumi?
00,1010+
I see.
hm...
She King? Well at least this anime is not sexist?
sooo... the cat dissolves in water?
Whats the name of it again? I forgot >.<
00,10her fur is like steel untill it gets wet
but she is cute...fluttershy
Sumica - her fur is like a Phone Book
... hm... I know this is anime, but that isnt physically possible XD
phone books stop bullets.
00,10utawarerumono is the shows name
well, evolution didnt think that one very trough
Crystaline_Shard - yes, but get it completely wet and it's good for nothing but pulp
I think ill download the game to this >.>
further inspiration
>.>
00,10ohmy
this is a video game commercial?
namw of anime?
i like the twins in this series the best
00,10just said it Zawan
furry material
00,10you know they are guys yes RoboGerbil?
Dunno why but this reminds me of another anime I saw. can't recall much about it some guy hunting a demonfox or something.
Crystaline_Shard - inuyasha?
No.
Sumica: dori and gura?
00,10yep
tghyrdjksifjksldrgtjfd
Sumica: lies
It was like a z list anime. :/
Ok... why does everything think this is inuyasha?
00,10artstyle
Sumica: i remember one episode where theyre mising their shirts, definately boobage
00,10never happend
Robo has a thing for MOOBS?
Sure, just go through that tree
00,10nice warfan
A axe could easly go though steel :/
kitty got owned
00,10so many jokes
Should get Peta to watch this. :d
DED
http://derpy.me/-vFQV why would they use the blankey like that if they were guys?
RoboGerbil - because Japan?
^
i dont speak japaness i have no idear whats going on
Crystaline_Shard: a fish dying is like women abuse, rite guise
00,10never head of beshonen have you
MadSurge: What does what I said have to do with woman abuse or fish?
RoboGerbil: assuming that means anything in anime is a common mistake B)
00,10and yes they are guys it's just never said in the anime
lol aruruu is so vague
KITTY!
BABY TIGER, KILL IT
00,10and now you understand why you see her on a tiger in the intro
NO KILL IT
so those two little ones holding the tiger
Sumica: Because the writers decided to make something from the intro relivant to the story for once?
are guys?
so those are the twins in question?
00,10the whole intro infact Crystaline_Shard
Xd.
im pretty sure this was a manga before it was an anime
"Thanks for leeting me live, just wait until I'm big enough to MURDER AND EAT YOU ALL"
00,10no Buytoast, charicteres that come in later on
ah
Sumica!!! O////////O what the.... this game... what!
00,10it was a porn game before it was any thing RoboGerbil
Haha.
Phase4!!!!
Welcome to the internet Panda.
00,10looked it up did you Panda?
from humble beginnings
Sumica: seems to know it all.. or is making it up... not sure which
ohai Panda
Sumica: just like Caramelldansen :D
RoboGerbil - it's legit
Ero Novel
Sumica yes... yes I did... like... what!!!!
00,10exactly MadSurge
or whatever you call that particular genre of Visual Novels
BRB. hungry.
Panda: did i miss anything important?
From my understanding, the hentai in the game this is based on is at the very least very late in the game
this chat is getting very good
Needless sex is needless Sumi!!!
Dark_Horst no, why? ^^
00,10indeed
Jesus bird
oh well, nanoha is made by a company known for hentai movies.. then they made a kids show x.x
And then ded
Panda: you seem kind of excited. in which way is left to be determined
he wantched some porn
:O
alright, 4:15am. time for bed
oh no
O_O
nigh-... errr, morning?
aw shit
bleh... i'm out
the ad popped up at the worst time
Dark_Horst, nah, I was just flabergasted...
goddamn no muting allowed bullshit
Panda: how come?
RoboGerbil, I saw Triangle Hearts Sweet Songs Forever. There's a pretty distinct seinen vibe to it. And I see shades of that in every Nanoha series.
Buytoast: why u no adblock
Skar song! :D
i'm too lazy to get it
Kandarihu i have no idea what you just said
plus the ads aren't that annoying
except for when they don't lemme turn the volume down and something like this comes on
Dark_Horst, well... you go in looking up different ideas for ears for your anthro-furry style art and suddenly tits... so yeah
Is this another animatic?
Sumica: you have to seend me this link plz plz plz i love you forever
its old
umm
Panda: oh hey, internet

00,10this is nanoha
suddenly cute
00,10she just dont know it yet
Sumica who Shizu?
oh? what exactly is a gundam then? thought is was a mech
Sumica: does this anime have swords magic and or a giant flying robot?
But it's schoolgirls, this can't be Nanoha
Crystaline_Shard: yes all of the above
00,102 of those 3
cardcaptor sakura? O_____O
......i think sumica made a joke
Crystaline_Shard: but you gotta wait till season 2 for robots
Crystaline_Shard, there are giant robots in this, but they are superfluous
00,10she makes friends using ion cannon strikes
using the orbital friendship cannon before it was cool?
its a anime magical girl version of MLP
"Ignore this fireball it's how I say Hello"
Caution: little girls have nude transformations in this
i have so menny qustons
guys my one of my brony friends told me to read sweet apple massacure to get cupcakes outa my mind well im notg thinking about cupcakes any more
T_T
00,10she has also mastered the dungion bypass
what is this kingdom hearts sailor moon robot stuff
Kandarihu: that's the exact reason I never watched this.
goddammit japan
... Sumica, forgive me... but is this influenced by Cardcaptor Sakura? The design and such.
U_U
always about young girls, robots or ghosts
Crystaline_Shard, you can just cover up that part with your finger. It's a great series besides it
00,10enemy on far side of maze> blast hole through maze to reach enemy and befrend the fuck out of them
hey everypony :)
00,10could be
I thought Nanoha was about girls with technology and lasers...?
Sumica, have you seen blue seed?
00,10yes i have, watched it on hulu, crazy show but realy good
Kandarihu well i knew the gundam part was a joke XD
Sumica: does she weild the Orbital Friendship cannon?
00,10protable version
Sumica you should stream it. I mean, its one of the older anime series' thats often over looked >.>
i has no ida whats goin on
speaking of hulu,i need to finish up on Tiger & Bunny
looks exacly like shin chan's house
lol epic wake up
Sketch_Toku_Brony that anime is awesome
Is this a retelling or the original anime?
Well, this is another series that I can miss parts of and not have to skip out on, since I saw it all to the end.
I'm gonna comapir the trasformation scenes to Dogdays.
red sky blue leves ......... all ways a good sighn
00,10this is her family, pay them little mind they wont be in the story for long
im pretty sure this anime was inspired by card capture sakura
Sumica: everyone dies?
hey im gona try take a nap be back soon
00,10no, they just play little to no importants to the story
midday sleep time :)
bye bye bronies
onii chan....agian?
Yeah. Nanoha's family has a proportional amount of screentime in this as she did in Sweet Songs Forever, except for her father who was dead.
00,10now you fucked up
onii-chan onee-chan
is onii chan like a popular japanese nickname for big brother
Onni chan. (30 guys) WHAT!?
00,10well and her brothere and sister who were screwing Kandarihu

00,10they were not related in the game this got it's start from Buytoast
ah
Sketch_Toku_Brony does it.... really glow?
Sumica was this a eroge game too? >.>
LEt's introduce the parent's FOR NO REASON AT ALL! :/

Awww they're discussing cutie marks :D
asdfghjkl

The game. you just lost it.
Hm... there are a lot of anime adaptations of eroge visual novels huh?
00,10yep
asdf movie, tranzlation "A Super Duper Funny Movie"
00,10saves cost on developing a story
TEAR HER FACE OFF
I want to eat on a roof -___-
omg was that engrish I hearD?
Panda, in Sweet Songs Forever, the Takamachi family were an elite team of bodyguards lead by their mother. Miyuki and Kyouya did all of the work while their little sister Nanoha ran the coffee shop they were based out of.
suddenly english
take she shortcut through the spooky park
^
Kandarihu oh.
NO
a bunch of kinds can handle any crazy stuff in that forest
You are suffering from schizophrenia and mild psychosis Nanaho.
Help yourself, on your own!
DOTS
Well one of them carry's around the orbital friendship cannon no worrys.
tame ferrit in the middle of nowhere
TrixieMuffins!
Seems legit.
hi
GO AWAY, don't touch the otter thing!
Crystaline_Shard, carrying around? an orbital weapon?
MadSurge, it's a ferret
00,10not quite yet Kandarihu but soon she will
another anime featuring a person who looks really cute but steals a WHOLE bunch of screentime and an animal with magical powers *cough* MLP FIM *cough* Pokemon *cough*
00,10the gemstone is the key
if ferrets didnt stink id prolly get one
00,10and ded
lol lazy ass ferret. :/
i have a ferret it's at my mother's there halarious
I wonder how my two cats would react to a ferret in the house?
Good morning Bronystate
Kandarihu prolly would think its another cat
well im go good night every pony
Kandarihu: scratching post.
00,10morning Gold_Demona
Kandarihu: the ferret mght eat them^^
>_> ^_^ <_< (eye roll)
RoboGerbil, you're right. They'd be freaked.
damn emotocons
good night evry pony im of to bed

nigth Panda
actually... i should hit the hay too.. I have a big day tomorrow ^^
Here's the overanimated part
ferrets are great at killing snakes
^
I thought that was mongooses
00,10ah refering how the animation quality goes down after the first ep Kandarihu
And, back to normal
how much strength can a 15 year old have?
Panda: yous be surprised
well it *is* anime Dark_Horst, so I'm assuming she is OP
panty shot.
you re now deaf
The fuck
What series is this anyway?
Crystaline_Shard O_o i didnt see a panty shot there XD
00,10Nanoha
It kinda irks me when animated characters move their entire bodies merely the sake of motion. Some people consider it quality animation, I see it as wasted effort.
^
Kandarihu thank you ^^
IT'S AN EVIL GERBIL, KILL IT
it aint a gerbil :(
00,10WREK!

MadSurge, the name Gundam is basically a compound noun of literally Gun and Dam. As in a gun-equipped weapon that holds back the horrors of war like a dam.
Ayyyyy sexy Tia~! :D

Gold_Demona, ohayo literally means good morning
Man back then it was popular back then
Jumangi!!!!
Kandahiru: I know this. But it sounds like "Ohio"
00,10the I came one yeah that's a dari thing
Sumica: the internet is a wonderful thing :D
Gold_Demona, I know it does.
Kandahiru: Good. We both know. :D
So in japan they actually let you walk around like that?
I don't think so :D
Crystaline_Shard, I don't think so. It's just a stage show, and a music video.
^
Instead of serving jail time they have to do this as part of probation.
Thank You!!
:D
It's more of a satire of the common attitude of pointless optimism.
BOOO MORE ANIME
:P
Time for more Sailor Sakura Ferret Girl
Kandarihu: I know poknig fun teasing or w/e you wanna call it.
Gold_Demona: when did you came in?
Half an hour ago

Superheroes must be REALLY expensive to keep around.
00,10kinda why tiger and bunny was diffrent Gold_Demona
Gold_Demona: there was a Powerpuff Girl episode about that :D
00,10superheros had corprate sponcers
MadSurge: They did that in the PPG movie. XD
YOU'RE A RAT, YOU CAN'T HAVE A MA<E

*NAME
00,10busted
Talking rat :/
Crystaline_Shard: or "flying brick"
Sumica: now she fucked up
Ha!

I actually overheard someone say onii-chan when it was loud in my class at school, so I got up and shouted WHO SAID THAT
That's me in the morning
.-.
The thing from under the sheets!
00,10he should be ashamed of him self
00,10going around licking people and watching a girl change
XAX: and then you said NOW YOU FUCKED UP :D
Ferrets aren't actually rodents though...
Stop molesting the rat dear.
:/
lol
Your a glass cannon Nanoha that means woman et in the back and spam yer ao.
aoe*
MadSurge: He didn't say it again, because no one got the reference, because they're all socialfags with lives and they don't even internet.
00,10nice Crystaline_Shard
00,10how right you are
XAX: how dare they have a life :D
Eee I got praise.

therainbowvortex: awww, take care!
Bye therainbowvortex, why not? :<
AdamTheDuck: my pc will be getting fixed
Ah, cool.
My maggggggggical powers. ohhhhhh
:/
Spectrum_Rush, didn't Wrek just link that?
AdamTheDuck: so this is good bye for a while youve been a good friend
/me checks
I guess there are three ways school cirriculum can be handled in anime, each less common than the one before it. Filler, thematic, or plot critical.
/me gives therainbowvortex a farewell lick :P
ok time for sleeps
I'd say that the lesson on composing kanji from radicals is thematic.
I know you hate them :P
05need to watch that one with school rivalty where when they fight their clothes explode off them...
we are losing our auidiance quick cut to something cute andf fluffy!
DAMMIT, PISS SKY
Wrek. Dogdays?
05noclue
05dunnothename
05dontcare
00,10could be any number of anime realy
05suddenlylackosspaecbar
00,10pigdog
You wanna see some real pornariffic transform watch dogdays season 2.
:/
Dog Days is an alright series, except for the fact that it manages to achieve arc-fatigue in a single cool.
Password was too long anyway. :P
00,10she put her AA's in to quick cast
I would've put it into Spallcasting Fury myself. =/
She activated the magical doohicky with out reciting the overly long password that could potentially get them killed
Or Spellcasting Mastery
05gotta love when a hot chick in class thats in your buddy gang sends you a text going "hey! bible black next weekend at my house? :3"
00,10lol wrek
All right :D
Yeah! You caught Houndoom!
05it went otu to everyone in the buddy gang
05if i didnt make that clear
Sumica: so where's the twist in this anime? :D
Dat dog
:D
Corgi~
MadSurge, he kinda spoiled one of the twists already.
00,10much later it comes
But maybe not quite
05last tiem she made us watch the one with the pink gel that makes peopel super horny
I like this ED, but I LOVE the A's ED
Wrek: .....wut
00,10hmmmmm, was't planing on streaming this long.
00,10what to show now.
MOAR.
Sumica: more youtube stuff?
Sumica, up for some tf2?
Uh, Bible Black is hentai
Also I dunno dogdays?
00,10did you want to take over Phase4?
not sure, still need to install the stream stuff
05MadSurge: i have no idea
Dog Days is actually produced by the same studio that did Nanoha: Seven Arcs
05i dont get to pick so
Interesting.
Sumica >.>
YAY
NOW YOU FUCKED UP
NOW YOU FUCKED UP!
You know what? I really hate this excuse for a meme.
Sweetie-chan
I REALLY hate it
YOU HAVE FUCKED UP NOW
Onii-chan o3o
XD
that really sucks, the extra registers boost encoding performance
XD
omg, thats awesome.
05Phase4: i think there is
Appolblewm!
05check the wiki
00,10there is a 64bit FMLE
oh neat
00,10and yeah the wiki has links but you still have to log in to adobi to download them
I think I understand the problem behind GG, that has made PSO2 so unpleasant to launch. It thinks that ANY 64-Bit program is potentially Cheat Engine in disguise. So it'll kill it just to be safe, even if it's critical for Windows to function.
00,10so what time do you think you will be back later wrek?
Sumica: so do you have the Apple.mov version of this? :D
um, need some help finding it
Who uses cheatengine?
:/
More animeeeee
i've gone to adobe and cant find the 64bit version
05lesson starts at 13:30, ends at 15:40
05will be home around 16:30
05it is now 11:3=
0530*
theres just 3.2 and 3.1, both look like 32bit
00,10so 5 hours from now
oh lol, have to scroll down
00,10and yeah sorry Phase4 it's the server side this that comes in 64bit
no nvm, thats a something else
Crystaline_Shard, a very small percentage of people from outside Japan who play Japanese PSO2
Sumica, yeah
PSO2?
I'd just like to warn you, Phase4. If you were to stream Japanese PSO2, don't count on any 64-bit program to be stable during startup
as much as they yell and complain, porting something to 64bit is trivial
00,10phanasy star on line 2
Phantasy Star Online 2
Ah that.
i have no clue what that game is so it shouldnt be a problem
Phase4, besides it's stupid security, it's an awesome game.
00,10kinda want to slauter kerbals
This reminds me of, uhh what's that anime again?...
i've not seen sumi kerbals in a while
Card Captor Sakura, that's it.
My hubby and I slaughtered kerbals last night. =D
I played the original phantasy star games the first three. then rage quit at the horrible controls :/
Kerbal Space Program, the Kerbal massacre simulator 9000
And launched them to the edge ot the known universe and made them orbit the sun. XD
Gold_Demona: we're all proud of you then :D
00,10i have not played with .17 much yet
Ded
00,10want to test out spaceplanes more
00,10see if they fixed the air presure issue
I'm stuck playing .13 because we're cheap and don't wanna buy the updated version yet. :P
BRB. drinks.
hmmm, theres a new one called ffsplit
00,10the longer you wait the more it will cost
I've taken a big break from my levelling for the sake of trying to get some friends onboard using the Friend Request system. It's pretty important that I get that straightened out before I hit 10, 20, 30, or 40 in any class. And I'm lvl 19 in all 3 now.
It raises in price as it updates?
05or we can play some planetside while my pants dry
05oh thats right dammit, servers are probably down
using ffmpeg, naturally, lets see how this goes
00,10it's now 18bucks
What was it before?
:< that's $3 more than last time
00,10was 12 when I bought it
00,1015 when phase got it

My husband and I had so much fun with it last night, I'm sure he'll like having all the extra parts... And the other moon... And the rest of the solar system. XD
05yeah as i said
00,10oh right lib
05also this
05Facility Capture times have been changed. They increase based on the amount of influence and size. And before you say it, we verified with all sources and can confirm that is not what she said.
00,10I keep thinking of the galaxy as the lib
05you cant say the PS2 team doesnt have humor
00,10well it is a sony team
00,10is he checking out her ass?
05Vanguard Shields are now a certification and item. Please remember to equip this item in order to ensure increased surviviability of the shield. We make a killing in resales.
05YES FINALLY :D

05type of tank
05also
00,10oh the heavy tank
05they not only buffed prowlers separately
05all tanks have higher armor rates
Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I know :P the mole thinks it's sexy though
00,10good
05read this sumica :D
05Due to new military aviation standards, ejection equipment is now available for certified pilots in all aircraft. While there is no dishonor in escape, remember that aircraft will be deducted from your standard pay.
00,10was kinda messed up I could two shot a tank with off the shelf rpg
00,10good
UND DANN
05maybe
00,10they realy needed parachutes
uh oh
i see where this is going
Giant Flittershy
05they also nerfed max units
*Fluttershy
00,10then again the last 3 deaths with you wrek did't realy leave time for bale out
00,10oh maxes are easyer to kill?
05they now have a respawn timer and resource cost
00,10eh, kinda mixed on that one
00,10ahhhhh
05so we wotn be seeign too many max deathballs
00,10every one goes max to hold a base
05they buffed heavy assault slightly too
05With the proper training (certification) Heavy Assault will find the extra 3 pockets hidden on their suit enabling them to carry more rockets. We promise they are there!
00,10lol
05Terran Republic and Vanu Sovereignty researchers have improved a few of their standard issue weapons. They request complete field testing, so good luck with that. Bring a helmet. See details below.
00,10that joke is cause the cert did't work before
~i just remembered what happend in september~
05DoctoDoctorWho: maybe, but im ont good at drawing 40k armor
00,10Sing it to your self

05and theres handegg
lol
so um
I like that name. handegg XD
is that staff magic or post singularity tech?
05even more tank buffs Sumica
05Mineguard Certification is available to mitigate damage to your tank. Don't become a victim and ensure you are prepared. Remember the Nanite Systems slogan: “Mineguard: If it blows up, it’s probably your fault.”
i meen its talking like a robot
Magic for every situation because the plot said so.
05and the last noteable change Sumica: Warp Gate’s have been re-designed. It’s now easier to board your allies’ vehicles with less risk of being run over. Still be sure to look both ways before running out of the spawn area.
00,10know that all to well
00,10got slamed by a quadbike the other day

CrimsonPhoenix, i meen the song was this song before it was the dota one
Never too much

No such thing as too much
Sumica, there is never too much engine.
put more on the back fins
Sumica, too..much..engine?
or rockets or duct tape.
what is this i dont even
What is this "too much" you speak of, Sumica?
Phase4, that's what I mean dota came before all I ever wanted
it was dota before it was all I ever wanted
MOAR DAKKA!
CrimsonPhoenix, i think we're misunderstanding each other so i'ma return to rockets
Sumica you know that's gonna tear the ship apart
Well, 4 more voicepacks and my Vocaloid downloading will be finished.
put wheels in the front!
XD
still front heavy
you need more rocket
^
*bonk*
MOAR DAKKA!!!
There we go
:D
LOL
Nope xD
LMAO
put wheels in the front
SLOWER NOSEDIVE
...gah I hate it when a discussion ends bluntly like that
wonder what it looks like in iva
hit the go be4 it completely tipped ove
Yeah, totally!
I think all those rockets on the wings are shifting the center of gravity in front of the front wheels
for teh lulz
:D
Spectacular!
oh gawd wut
All the lag :D
It just happened
DISINTEGRATED
And he lives!
I told you the ship would tear apart.
he had fun
Holy crap!
Sumica, try the iva
The cockpit is undamaged!
I'm laughing for real right now :D
Sumica, next to the eva button
At first Lambro Kerman was like :O and then he was like :)
ah
it is
kinda anoying but asas adds so much i ignore it
put alottashit on da back
So that yellow and black sphere, is that a representation of the center of gravity?
Kandarihu: eeyup
Kandarihu, eeyup
Oh, I see.
AdamTheDuck: haha
6_9
Sumica, useless in the atmosphere
So is this a brand new version of the game then?
incredibly heavy and has bugger all power
but in a vacum its more than twice as powerfull as any other engine
well, twice as efficent
still only a piddly little 60 thrust
the thrust must be over 9000!
Incredible for orbital manuvers though, its practically imposible to do interplanetary without it
ohai bill
my bill crashed into duna
jebs stuck on eve
ikr!
I can see everything from in here! :D
lol
its like ork tech
wow...first person view?
YAAAAAAY
i blame the lack of windows
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
damnit
:D
Dark_Horst, eyup, iva
We're gonna need another Bill!
Dark_Horst, the pods have controls and instriments in the iva view that work
though the only control that works afaik is the throttle
Wee!~
yay!
Takeoff! :O
aww it didn't crash :D
lol
XD
Bill's not too happy. XD
kerbals do not need windows
they fly entirely by feel
and it falls
EVEN IN SPACE
Windows are a structural weakness
wont pull up XD
bye bill
pull up!
its gona be close
DED
We're gonna need another Bill!
nooooooo!
ded
Make one with 30 engines
:D
add a fuel tank
it really anoys me
Heya ponies
Hello Tiberium126
ohai Tiberium126
Sumica, show me?
i've not managed it
I wish there was a game just like this except for ground craft
XD
neved got to see that one
Sumica, the .16 craft files work in .17, could show it
ah
Oh my gosh
There's a Charlie the unicorn ponified video
then I could design tanks and stuff
well it was inevitable
CrimsonPhoenix, its funny
I Love Charlie the unicorn series so yeah I do think it's amusing as well
is that version 0.17?
Dark_Horst, this is 0.17
we really do need a land vehical based version of this
thank ye
huh, so that works
oh god i see where this is going
oh god
MORE ENGINES!
this will hurt
Sumica, LAUNCH IT
o.o I look away for 2 minutes and I see this
MORE PONIES
Oh God this is going to be awesome :D
should work
who agrees we need a land version?
this will break atmosphere
everyone
by which i meen this will break the atmosphere
huh... it doesnt explode
it works
lol nope
Uh oh
DoctoDoctorWho, not sure if there is, but there might be a mod for it for this game? ponyshrug.jpg
and loud
Lots of rockets. Of course it's loud. :P
outta gas
this concept is worth following
Sumica MORE ENGINES :/
^ :D
little too late :P
minimum is just under 150 iirc
DO IT FILLY! :D
hmmmm
dang, nittany isnt here
need to be 20% more engines
this will explode so hard
DO IT FILLY
I has a nittany zebra
http://derpy.me/J3Dl8
D'awwww
lol wut
lulz it's working
inb4 it makes it to space
o.o It's working? :D
nvm
lol uh oh
Yay explosions!~
weeeeeeeeeee
nope
your mission is not to go to space but fly debris to the MOON
lol, Why is he outside?
Did he try to abandon ship?
Notice how adding more engines actually made it betteR?
and then his legs were broken
Yay!
it seems to be a documentary podcast about... a post office
HE'S ALIVE! :3
you should see what happens when you go eva on jook
jool'
I've got it!
alright, it seems to be satire
MORE ENGINES :D
MOAR
NOT ENOUGH ENGINES
My OC will be shipped with(pause for dramatic effect)...
THE INTERNET!
http://derpy.me/ensK1
DoctoDoctorWho: Your OC is Tumblr?
DoctoDoctorWho: :D at least it's not a main character!
Only half? o.o
no no no MOREENGINE FIRST
Gold_Demona: ouch, that hurts
:D
Mother of Celestia...
how is this working
I love internet pony
ohai orbit
i meen holy crap orbit
that is a fast rocket
Nooooo! The rockets my husband made aren't compatible anymore! D:
Sumica, you got escape velocity?
pfft, screw gravity
:'(
ah well
close
See My design worked I am brilliant engineer.
Gold_Demona: you know what you should do?
Sumica, add about another 1k delta-v and you should have escape velocity
DoctoDoctorWho: What?
Gold_Demona: well first, are you good at art?
dat asas bug
Sumica, tap f to solve it
DoctoDoctorWho: If you call this good, then yes. http://fav.me/d5fbivg
asas gets confuse for some reason
spin stabalized
Sumica, new time warp in the atmosphere as well
up to 4x
Gold_Demona: perfect, you should make a comic about how you and your husbands OC met!
also parachutes have gotten a little more fragile
Does this mean we have to build all our rockets all over again? :C
Gold_Demona: It would be so sweet!
Cuz I don't remember how these ones were made...
The free version, yes
Gold_Demona, yeah, all the parts work different and the .craft is incompatible
Yeah, I stuck them in the VAB folder
Sumica, 0.16 had incompatible changes due to the removal of self colisions
I tried to open them and it said "Cannot because it's incompatible with this version lololol.
you can force the rockets in by changing a line in the file
but the become mutilated monstrosities
MORE FUEL AND ENGINES
needs moar everything
Uuuggghhh... These rockets were so good. ><
They bounced off the edge of the universe. :<
Wow! That's a lot of fuel!
yeah, tricoupler abuse
Sumica, i started doing that, built a craft called dense
i'll send the .craft over if you want to try
I'm gonna reinstall the free version in a separate folder so we can still play with the rockets we made when we want to. And maybe take screenshots so we can try to recreate them in the new version.
Gold_Demona, you can just download a complete .17 from the store and put it in a new folder
Yeah I know, but I already replaced the old one with the new one cuz I didn't think our rockets would be incompatible.
ah
the incompatible change annoys me, i had a rocket called tri that i wubbed very much
Yeah, we wub these rockets too. :<
those rockets that are two rockets
18 engines.
:/
NOT ENOUFF
Sumica, launch with the clipped engines, trust me
it will be fun
One rocket I made was just a shit ton of solid rockets. XD
im finally done with my first video
LOL
NOT BIG ENOUGH
hello everyone
Hiyo flutterchu
ololololo
Hello flutterchu
Gold_Demona: but really tho you should make a comic about you and your husbands OC meeting
IT'S ALIVE
DoctoDoctorWho: Need a design for my hubby's OC first. Having trouble with that. :P
Well it's still safer then aircanida :/
we lost some bits
soo close to surviving
DoctoDoctorWho: Only thing I have so far is he's an earth pony, he has brown hair, and he wears a black baseball hat with a gold P on it.
Oh, and facial hair. He has a moustache and goatee.
Gold_Demona: once you finishes making it its going to be awesome
gtg
I don't have a cutie mark or a coat color for him...
im going to sleep now see ya guys later
clipped parts are fun, when they are part of the same craft or bit of debris they dont collide, but if the become seperate parts when you seperate they do
Mine's a teal pegasus named Whimsy Floof.
so clipped parts, if the seperate into different bit of debris, become self destruct stages
She makes cloud sculptures
i have a hoof with little pikachu fingers sticking out in the middle (sorry about that)
woah stable
not for long
holy shit it's actually going in space
im in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
This here is my OC. I made it to look like me(colors). It doesent have a pony-ish name or a cutie mark yet.
i think your on the last set of tanks
http://imageshack.us/a/img441/1025/xaxpone.png
More engine always works.
Not amused XAX is not amused
Should this be deemed a rocket or space station?
XD
Morning everypony! ^_^
love clipped parts
AdamTheDuck: http://imageshack.us/a/img69/7919/omfgfy.png
Good morning Ponies47 :3
lol
lol :D
XAX that's quite a popular method in OC, very safe and all but I'll just suggest to try and mix up some colors. In any case it's still good.
and are those eylashes?
CrimsonPhoenix: Thing is, I dislike using vibrantasfuck colors like I see on most OCs.
XAX is dull pony
And yeah, they probably are eyelashes. derp'd in pone creator.
just don't do vibrent
also time warp sometimes breaks chutes
Phase4: and proud.
and try to make something fit?
/me looks at stream "that cant be safe"
pfft whatever
The most colors
3-4
for ap ony.
General rule.
derp, wrong tab
Shard: NO NO NO it's all wrong I said more ENGINES!
not aware of any hotkey to switch the thing
Crystaline_Shard, sumi stopped adding engines and started adding straight up explosives
it will be faster
See! more engines more stability!
Good morning, everypony! :)
morning RaveBrony
Is this you, Phase4? :P
RaveBrony, nope, Sumica
Ah :D
woah lag
Yeah, lol
this is gona be fast
that must be kerbin escape
oh come on
very close though
Need to draw shard in a hardhat yelling MORE ENGINES :/
i dont know...........sumica is i predict the most offending streaming pony here on bronystate :P
Lolwut
the pilot knows what happens when sumi stages
o_o
Yay!~
Kaboom!
Sumica: Adding more rope to the noose would make it looser correct?
we found the kaboom
Wtf :D
RaveBrony, clipped parts, cause of changes in 0.16
too long and you can walk off wearing the thing
Oh o:
Omg!
you need to make a rocket that breaks through then turns around fires up erry engine and plummets back.
thats a problem i keep having in my designs too
i want more rocket but the entire thing is already covered in rocket
"Orbital Friendship cannon"
interplanetary friendship missle
You people and your spaceship stuff :D
Yes I am obsessed with Friendship cannon.
bye
of course.........now i KNOW everyone wants me dead
Cya flutterchu
D:
still a little space there
So many rockets O_o
Not enoff.
:3
:D
Add a FTL drive :D
Drink drink drink drink!
Sumica, mind if i ninja the mips to test ffsplit?
And now I want a soda... *goes to the kitchen to grab one*
ah, nvm
Sumica, well i tried limev but its not working
not sure if ffsplit or limev thats at fault
Storm clouds are best nap spot!
LOL
More engine?
XD
Oh geez, this can only end in awesome. XD
Badass.
wrong way!
INB4: VOOM
*BOOM
IT's COMING AT US!
:/
Bahahaha!~ :D
: |
Ha! :D
lol
Rockets aren't meant to bounce. XD
Unless you hit the edge of the universe. :P
: D
ITS READY FOR SPACE
._.
This can only end well
SPOON
dat ship
Well, shit
:D
XD
Dis song <3
omg i have idea
Sumica, ffsplit works! little fiddly
hi everyone :)
RaveBrony: well, I guess you DO like raves :D
wow... this Music takes me back XD

Oh hey Dj_Cyber-4G
i have to miss my work today because my athsma is working up and i had to use a nebulizer
now my heart is raceing faster than a train
XD
lol
Dj_Cyber-4G: I here the season or something is getting worse this year for those with athsma.
hear*
physics dont know what to make of this rocket
Lol!!!
:D it's the Chaos theory!
its worse in New York thank god im going home tomorrow
the exploding seems to have stabilized
Dj_Cyber-4G: Thats good to hear. Try not to over exert yourself for awhile.
:D
im just afraid on the g-force you will get when this thing DOES get going
Sumica, try this one https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/Boom.craft
i want to see if your pc can handle it
put some stableizers on dat bitch
Weeeeeeee
SHIT NOOOO
hallo everypony
wow
Annnnnnnnnnnd gravity
Hey LightTrooper105
falling
Wonkavator
/me give Ponies47 cheese
Parachute....
XD
:D
did it fall off or did you forget
its a nuke
Lunch, brb
/me Noms on the cheese
XD
right back down
Sumica, try the one i linked
OH NO THIS WON'T WORK
inb4 it works
Phase4: NOPE
you will get 9 g-force and c4rash
o.o
Sumica, not really
SPACE SHARK!! NOT AGAIN!
inb4 physics breaks
oh my god, Sumica: try the craft i linked
it goes boing
i'm testing it now
my craft i meen, not the physics break canards
LOL
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
WOOSH
-lol Satellite =D
:d
TO THE!!... moon?
booom
in atmosphere satellites
HOW IS IT STILL GOING
wow thats freakin halarious
Ill be honest.
Thats kinda awesome -lol
i managed to use this as a parachute once
Sumica, i've managed to get it almost stable but yeah, this is new
not like this
its like a blimp
EXPLODEINATE
except made of wings
How do you think the kerbals in control feel right now?
(invisible pegasus pushing it]
oh yeah if you oscilate left and right it accelerates
lol
WHAT THE FUCK AHHAHAHA
:D
Acceleration is magic
PHYSICS ARE NOO MORE
ksp dont know how to physics XD
Sumica, it will lag your machine
00,10wth is this, a text file?
why didja give it to em then
Sumica, also let the suports detatch without the first stage fireing
is .craft file o_O
it will LAGG
00,10i opend the link you gave and got a page with text
strange
Sumica, try 'save as'
if we could see more to the right it would be stream-seption
its odd that dropbox does this
00,10next time just pass the file via skype
will do
Alright I'm back, are we still watching Kerbals die? :3
i usualy listen to my own music while this is going on but with the voice i can't
i could probibly work arround the background music though
Time for school.Later everypony ._.
00,10big file
nemnemnemnem
see ya ponies47
Bye Ponies47
get GOOD GRADES OR ELSE!
byxe Ponies47 :)
Oh God wat
So many rockets :D
huh, not sure why it didnt save that
ITS DEATH WITH A COCKPIT!
pure destruction
ZS
lol
XD;
LOL Haven't even launched yet. XD
it does bounce
I'm so glad I came back in time for this launch :D
lol
what is with the kerbals face?
O_O oh my gosh what a rocket to wake up to
da fuq?
BarbetosSMASH, i think his brain failed
Slinky =D
you ok sumica?
>_<
LLOOOOLLLL
ded
LOL not a slinky. :D
Oh.
wut
explosions yay
Well your Kerbal lived. that is the first problem
thats why i called it boom
neither did i
it immedietly exploded
The kerbals face
My husband and I tried to destroy the VAB last night, but we suck at piloting. :P
Wat the hell?
Sumica, if you take a few stages off it becomes possible to launch it
He is like staring into our souls
^ o.o
He's leaving
Phase4: So in esscense those mini rockets are sticks of dynamite??
Mega_Milk, seems like
NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
its DOOM WITH A COCKPIT
Sumica, i have no idea, it suprised me
should see what happens when you detatch from the tower without fireing the engines
Cockpit view! =D
oh no poor whoever is in that ship or anywhere near it
ear deth
dat noise
-lol
weeeeeeeeeeeeee
He lives :D
/me BLUUGGHH
You spin me right round, Sumi. Right round.
Like a record Sumji, right round round round!~
Sumi*
oh?
Phase4 why u stay up late
JRP2234, cause i can
XD
helicopter are fun
helichopper
LIES
I brokeded my game. :C
this makes me wanna assemble model rockets
/me installs Kerbals
sumica anything you make promotes laughs and doom
Ah well, the rocket I was making wasn't that good anyway. :P
Phase4 can u host a gmod server?
inb4 dissapointment
JRP2234, yes, i wont
Oh no. I see where this is going.
:D
And spinning
this will be awesome
Sumica: isn't that just gonna spiral out of controll and explode
I foresee lots and lots of spinning
KSP and 'splosions? Naaaaaaah
Yeah, I can ee where this is going. :o
i'm actually expecting the wings to fly ogg
off'
LOL
XD
PFFT
lol
It fell apart
it didnt fall apart
Dat smile :D
it apart fell
oh god i wish i had this recorded ITS HALARIOUS
Off screen explosions. I just imagined that controll finally got exploded instead
broken physics
Yes, to assume makes an "ass" of "u" and "me"
wat
lol fell apart again. XD
LOL wtf
LAUNCH
And spinning!
my god it works
DAFAQUE
Bye wing
:D
that wing is totally like "Oh hey guys. just hanging out."
Screw physics :D
flying wing aircraft
maby less thrusters :$
Dj_Cyber-4G, Blasphemy
YES
THIS SONG
Awwwweeeeeessssommmmmeeee
Whaaa, remix?
NO OFFENCEIVE COMMENTS HERE! >_>
WOA BRO!
you lost a few
That was... interesting
:D
IT ACTUALY FLEW
now what
It didn't asplode
I suddenly don't feel like singing along to this song anymore... :<
MO THRUSTERZ
Sumica, i meen a bunch of the thrusters flew off
im listening to don't stop oliver's remix
huh
what did i see
ok SCREW PHYSICS FOR A SECOND
Almost survived
Nice. }3
Weeeeeee!~
COCKPIT VIEW QUICK
your a plane o3o
left and right are covered in wing
lol x-wing
sizzorcraft
yeah, the analog altimiter is not so good
but there is a ground radar
LAND
TRY TO LAND (and probibly fail)
Sumica, yeah, its the other analog altimiter that goes from 3KM to zero
lolded
K-O
Dat perfectly timed yay :D
Be a space helicopter!
then screw with them?
XD
AWESOME desktop....
where'd you get it??
Nice rawket. tiem to blewed up
im not a star trek fan personaly
0.17 feels less stable than the older releases
Dj_Cyber-4G, XD
whats so funny
not sure if trolling or actualy confusing mass effect with star trek
ive never played Mass Effect
i've got plenty of memory and it crashes anyway
and i have just seen the spaceship from star trek
Dj_Cyber-4G, you should watch star trek
but the normandy (thing from desktop) is from mass effect
Its not important
i don't know i LOVE Doctor Who so i might TRY it
very different shows
3 peeps
yesh but they are both Si-Fi
But hardly the same thing. :P
not really imho, dr who is almost fantasy
NAH
dat retrograde orbit
Why is the smoke so... clean looking?
time travel is a common thing now ever since it was created
they are screaming
Dj_Cyber-4G, the reason i consider it almost fantasy is because i lack a better word
lol
If Jeb was there, he'd be laughing instead.
the 'science' in dr who is more plot glue than science, which is fine and infact adds to the show
WEEEEEEEEE
Wibbley Wobbley Timey Wimey :P
crap i was in the back
this craft is designed for mun landing but i've not bothered to get it there
XD
no asas
i like the new space visuals
not having asas is silly
if you don't get a counter to the orbit you will burn up like a fly in a toaster
true
they have flat faces
that lever works btw
yeah
and you can drag it from the iva
look at the clock
XD
Dj_Cyber-4G, its not a clock :P
yeah it is
thats the ground radar above the artifical horizon
Dj_Cyber-4G, its an altimiter
or if not what is nit
noo the black thing to nthe bottom left of that
or in this one the direct left
stow away?
oh, bottom bottom left, that tells you what the controls are set to
poor guy gets no windows
he is sittin in the trunk
Phase4 he gets the screams of his other Kerbals
That is his only warning
When did that happen?
:D
Hahaha
that looked cool
he landed on water?
They so happy
or is gonna
theres a video of someone landing on the mun from this view
WUT
drowning
nope
falling out of the world?
nope drowning
they're fine
awww :'(
whyyyy
we will call it THE FLYING SQUIRRIL
why chat dead?
Now is the time for you to launch it, launch it launch it, launch it... o/~
im just watchung..
cause its monday/sunday
Dj_Cyber-4G, you killed it
We're just watching Sumi building in silence :P
:'( meanie
we are playing sshh
let us take a moment of silence for whoever it gonna be in this ship
I'm the world champion, bet you cna't beat me.
your on Kurra :P
I thought Fluttershy was the world champion. O_o
no angel is
he NEVER MAKES A SOUND
i actualy have confidence in this craft
except for that one time he coughed
oh yeah
like that?
this thing looks bad ass
so much overkill
Seems legit
wow JET SPLOSION COMEIN UP
T-Rex's in F-14's
Coolness limit has been exceeded
i'm not sure if it will go to space but i can garuentee it will go somewhere
the floor/
Nothing wrong with more rocket. =)
?
More rocket? Oh man. :D
wow badass ship
it really was lacking power
lol umm.....
Bwoing
he don't like dat
its got hydrolics
lets do this!
vtec just kicked in yo
NOOOO
He lived!
kerbals have this habbit of not dying
i've got one falling into the kerbin jupiter and he's not dead yet
What is up with the kerbals making that face? XD
In the free version they almost always died. :P
...
lol!
drift!
that of course is your main problem
i just saw them comeing together then i was like "NOOOOO"
it needs to be faster
How is he still alive?! :D
Gota go fast?
Yes, MOAR DUCT TAPE
ARE YOU ACTUALY USEING DUCKTAPE
thats what it looks like
LOL
They're actually support struts. :P
quack tape
nop that be duct tape
But yes, they do look like duct tape. XD
awww you ruined it Gold :|
:D
That's me! Ruiner of illusions and fantasy!
:'( why u ruin my life
Nonono. I don't ruin lives. Only illusions and fantasy.
EXZACTLY
duct tape? no we need scotch tape
If ruining your illusions ruins your life, then that's just a side effect. :P
is their nothing ducktape can't fix?
Uh oh. Thur's that bear again.
rivers :P
BEAR!
/me hides
That was one of my favorite cartoons ever.
FUUUUUUU
GOGOGOGOGOGOG
And wasn't it Warner Brothers?

:D
needs more wings
I thought it was from Freakazoid.
Yes he died!~ :3
hmmm
Sumica, what was that anime with the high school with mech training
the wings will come off if they are too long
yeah
Dj_Cyber-4G, you'd be suprised
It was a Gopher going to Hollywood to be a famous actor and ended up in a "nature documentary" where he constantly ran into this bear that always beat the crap out of him.
thc
thx'
Gunbustaaaahhhh~
/me cuts his mane! :)
/me cuts kurra's mane
Me! Sagging wing power! Go!
there was this awesome plane in gunbuster that i'd like to build
Yay sagging wings
where did areodynamics go?
SOCERY
i call hax
ITS TURNING RIGHT
What is that pink text?
SORCERY*
it triped
It almost made it to the end of the runway
unidentified what?
what´s name of this game?
ALL the flaps
Kerbal Space Program
thanks
need a tailplane
Or KSP for short
MORE DUCK TAPE? how could this go wrong 6_9
Oops, I was wrong. It was Animaniacs, not Freakazoid. :P
The short was called Hollywoodchuck.
I just like how some Kerbals start out looking like they where put in the cockpit against their will.
NOT AGAIN
BarbetosSMASH, considering the average ksp flight, they probably were
Hmm... More duct tape?
tape it to the grown
d
hm
its probably the kachunk noise thats the issue
stream freeze
ok we good
nope
yep
dead
Sumica, theres a bug where you have a decoupler not attached to anything that does that
Is it in the log?

Sumica, i think it might have used the shuttle one but this will probably be more interesting
make an X-wing! :D

Bye Dj_Cyber-4G
Tadaaa
and hi again MadSurge :P
We're just enjoying the show, Sumi
eating breakfast
I am watching though XD
i think everyones just quiet
Nah we're just watching you get ready to flip your table after trying to staple your wings
Also I'm drawing shtuff.
I'm nomming on breakfast while watching this
dont want crumbs all over me keyboard
XD
Gold_Demona: more gargoyle Pokemon hunting?
AdamTheDuck Sumica auxiliary table has already been fliped.
wow
:D
MadSurge: Not at the moment. I might draw more of that later though.
did you save the design?
Hahaha
Gold_Demona, i'm with MadSurge, read through your comic and now i want more :P
lol, Alright. I'll get started on the next page later on. XD
good on ya
i wonder if it will crash again
ksp is good about the autosave
wow Sumica , still streaming?
BarbetosSMASH, nah, its a random problem
Got through only Pokemon Black :D
hellO!
i'm betting they're gona push a 0.17.1 to fix it
hello?
hi
Hello clopper1935... Wait what?
what?
since1935
yeah
^ :3
Gold_Demona: do you have a fav pokemon? :D
perpetual clop of 1935 is better.
XD
WHOA!
:D
lo what a crash
XD
OHGODMYSIDES :D
awesome crash is awesome
MadSurge: Which is interesting, because before doing my Nuzlocke, I didn't used to like Gen 4 at all.
08,01fixing my mother's webcam this morning
Wings are bad for shock absorption
woo!
thats good...right?
Just let it go.
We will let science
do the work
weee
08,01http://i.imgur.com/cMNyd.jpg
Gold_Demona: I know only the latest Pokemons, but Darmanitan and the punk lizard are cool :D
thats a nice plane
this is a better game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfG-FSVthJU&feature=plcp
Phase4: it'd be a shame if something...happened to it
MadSurge: I really like Gen 5. It's the first time since Gen 2 I was actually impressed with e Pok?mon game.
08,01it's not a casual beard
08,01it's a lazy beard
ugh. burnt mah eggs. bleeech
Oh well
08,01Me is eating curry for breakfast
It's still a sexeh beard :P
Gold_Demona: I really like for one that they didn't allow you to carry over old pokemons until you beat the game legitly :D
now land :P
lol, landing
land in first person mode
They decided to take away the illusion of him being in control
MadSurge: They've always done that though, haven't they? Starting with Gen 3?
Sumica, c is a hotkey for the iva now, v does what c used to do
08,01MadSurge: meatball and bacon
08,01beef meetbals
08,01it's great, because this is a curry that can be eaten by neither hindus *nor* muslims
whoops
lol
PERFECT!
close enough
Gold_Demona: I dunno :D but the game is already pretty easy, steamrolling it with an ubermon :D
Thats coming out of his pay check
*might be overkill
lol-ed
AND THEN BOO<
ded

They provide burial money when entering the Space Program
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfG-FSVthJU&feature=plcp
Yeaaah.
NO YOUTUBE LINKS DURING STREAM
08,01clopper1935: no video links during a stream please
ok
MadSurge: I typically cheat when I play the game non-nuzlocke. I gameshark at the beginning to give myself the pok?mon I want to have and then go through the game raising them. :P
First time here clopper1935 ?
yeah
Hes lying
I started getting bored doing it that way though, which is why I decided to do this Nuzlocke.
killerpony7733 how u know that?
It's a guy whos been advertising his channel OVER AND OVER again
why is ther only space plane streams here
BarbetosSMASH The channel
Oh hm.
Gold_Demona: I don't need cheating, but I'm not competent enough to do it Nuzlocke
clopper1935 there is more than that.
good
MadSurge: I don't NEED cheating, perse. I just like having the pok?mon I want to have right from the getgo. :P
Check out the stream throughout the day, especially fridays and saturdays.
'Cause Kerbal Space Program is best explosion+massacre simulator
^
oh that reminds me, havent taken my pokewalker out of my backback for a month
Duckt tape is better
MadSurge: Especailly since my regular team mostly consists of gen 1 and 2 pok?mon
Especially*
Gold_Demona: :D
Phase4: y u no sleep
i no need sleep
Sleep is for the weak~
i am bront
brony'
we are immune from sleep
Sleep is for weenies. :D
Confound these ponies~
I am a big weeny
I love sleep
Gold_Demona: also I heard that gen 5 finally made nice insect pokemon
weenie hot jr
I have had two cups of coffee and I want to go back to bed.
MadSurge: The only bug I liked from Gen 5 was the electric tick/spider one
XD
MadSurge: I've never been one for bug types anyway. :P
Gold_Demona: mabye the legendary one too :D
your using the low altitude engines :P
MadSurge: I don't really like the legendaries.
...oh boy...
MadSurge: Mostly because there are WAY too many of them for one game.
13 legendaries in ONE generation...
going fowards is overated
lol, spinning
Why do you NEED that many legendaries?
13?
Gold_Demona: I tried to be varied, so I had at least one mon for all elite 4
Gold_Demona, yeah, legendaries are pointless now
we've regained balance...sorta
Hmm, where have I heard this song before?...
Gold_Demona: bragging rights
Sheesh, I didn't realize there were tha many o.0
MadSurge: No, I don't mean the player. I mean the game.
08,01ooo!
lol-ed
MadSurge: Why does the game NEED so many legendaries?
Gold_Demona, its less of a problem in japan where they are split into different levels of legendary but that didnt survive the translation
08,01someone should caption the image i took! (http://i.imgur.com/cMNyd.jpg)

DaringDerpy, ah, the old fm mobiles
DaringDerpy, those things were almost litteraly a normal phone with the phone line replaced by a two way radio
OMG DaringDerpy! My dad had one of those!
so far nothing has broken off
the adorable little kids in those commercials always get me
as expected
yes, sumi, you did
XD
I only know these phones from 80s yuppie movies
Haha, that was awesome :D
Well I think that's enough explosions and murder for me xD
/me presses L twice
Goodnight everyone :)
08,01I don't always drink tea, but when I do, it's at your mother's
bye AdamTheDuck
twilight_sprinkle: they don't do anything with me. kids are boring
He swims! :D
cute
DaringDerpy: boring? no. annoying? sometimes yeah
what is his maximum fall height above water?
annoying too. some of them are hard to scare away. idiots
no, I don't like them too much
Aah, here's the problem... TOO MANY TOASTERS
blasphemy
You can't have too many toasters, MadSurge. There are too many poptarts in the world.
needs more blenders
it will break again
:D
it needs streamers
ded
DaringDerpy: agreed!
I agree
Streamers and balloons
And CANDY!
it needs glitter!
add some speed holes
never could build planes this awesome
How about some french haute couture too?
yay
this ship just needs one of everything
twilight_sprinkle: yes :)
/me tattoos i love bubblebuddy on his chest
:D
sounds energic
well
bubble money
AND THEN
SPLASH
and then vanished
the runway is too short
lol
ded
To the cloning machine!
two more engines?
yay
this well end well
will*
it will probably touch ground at start
Sumica, try the sepperation srb? could probably pull the nose up with one of those
needs more engines
you have to drop it before takeoff
it will make an excellent power drill
I think it needs more rawket lawnchairs.
use more gun
and here we go
....
looking good
ded
dayum
that was a pretty good crash
dems some cool fireworks
XD
where can i get some
i like how the bits slowly get pulled off
so close
Moring all. I see Kebals are blowing up
inb4 it burns the landing gear off
^
what is this front wheel for?
Morning, Sumica
"where we're going we wont need wheels"
hai ASoftFluffyThing
those are the structural ones
kerbal scientists
barbie girl? :D
what?
Sumica, theres a seperator pylon on the next page
I mean.
er
there is no such thing as overkill
/me hugs twilight_sprinkle

hi ASoftFluffyThing
/me fluffs in twilight_sprinkle's arms
o.o
gesundheit
thats fluffy, alright
dat MST3K reference
ASoftFluffyThing: you remind me of my cat :D
Gold_Demona, which episode? i cant quite remember that line
I don't remember... I think it might've been the MST3K Movie, but I wouldn't swear to it.
sploosh
rammed the other wreck
And he went to see the sea ponies.
ker-sploosh indeed
clearly you need more boosters
F*cking windows 7
People still SAY "after these messages"?
I've been watching this stream for over an hour now. What game is this?
Thats fucking windows 98
Actually.
HoodyNinja|School, you have no idea how much i agree with you /)
droppable vertical boosters
DocSane: Kerbal Space Program
Phase4: (\
its the 'go up' button
dat basshunter
the kerbal is not convinced
Morning everypony just woke up around 9:45 over here
That kerbal just don't care anymore
Oh wait. Nevermind
hai Moopy
Bad poker face
spacecraft
this is more or less the kerbal method of visiting the sea ponies, no?
Hiyo Moopy
of space
it touches the ground
twilight_sprinkle: Yaaaay!
There's a reason space planes are usually launched vertically, you know.
Aww the Kerbals are sooo cute walking down there. It looks like they're waddling
DocSane: 20th century space planes
Oh silly kerbals. They try to explode loose debris instead of cleaning it up.
Barbetos|AtWork, silly humans miss out on all the fun of exploding debris
this is kerbin
So i went out back of my house over here and it feels pretty chill over here guys its awesome as hell
lol
hm...
Moopy: swag
inb4 it explodes
yay
DocSane: These are space planes, not rockets. Rockets are build in another building. :P
great success
D:
lol
XD
Oh Sumica <3
lol
stable?
dat stability
And just what do you use to get the plane to orbit? Jets?
dat kerbal
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/846
'Cuz I think the rockets are still going to be needed for that.
allah akbar!!!
DocSane: Jets, rockets, and LOTS of duct tape.
It looks like it's spazings
should i be concerned that its freaking out?
can't stop laughing
>pefectly stabl design
>looks like it's swimming
Why canards AND a rear stabilizer?
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maeyqxuHQC1rrck2e.gif
Barbetos|AtWork: i dont get it
Its aparently a DOTA thing.
I guess champions are the name they give "heroes" and LoL
And that kerbal is scared out his mind
in*
i played dota for some time, not the second one tho
#... 2... 1...
Dump the rear stabilizers and give it a vertical one.
Prepare for impact
we might make it
maybe
It's a good thing that im not in that.
...probably not
like a swan
Fly! Damn you, fly!
IT'S GONNA BLOW
ded
worst terrorist ever
LOL
DaringDerpy, you have no iead how hard I laughed at that
you can be happy it pulls up at all
lol, wrong hanger
*hangar
Took it to the rocket hangar instead of the plane hangar. XD
spectacular
lets get creative!
ASoftFluffyThing: :)
I think i done cutting my mane.
And in record time, too!
Ugh, 5 more days till i canget my computer fixed
fml
Hmmmmmm
you did nothing to raise the uplift force
MORE ROCKETS!
or to make it lighter
Ello there everybrony.
heyo Malavolent
hoi Malavolent
hi Malavolent
Morning, Malavolent
that bird exploded
It vered to the left some how.
Fatal
Hey sumica do the air plane style like from the air port
The little guy looks scared.
damn, they're onto me!
http://derpy.me/2py8X
Yep.
ok, it touches ground
Damn
next launch might be a succesful one
Fly, fly, fly!
or nto
Fly, my pretties! FLY!!!
not*
Damn the Kerbal is scared before he even takes off
ASoftFluffyThing: Perhaps it's because he knew his fate. :P
Gold_Demona: Those poor Kerbals. Wonder what he tell his family everyday
we are going to need anuther Timmy.
LOL
ASoftFluffyThing: "Well, let's see how many times I die today..."
Hey sumica are you listening some techno?
minimalist approach :)
lol XD
hi cades
this is going to go so well...
hey
Oh just of to let everypony know that the MoJang guys that they made minecraft games there going to put in some stuff on our xboxes cause were going to get updates pretty soon
whats up
Yes this is going to go very well.
millimeter?
too much clearance
need less
Good thing ther isnt a chicken on the run way.
well its back heavy but all the lift is twoard the back
XD
yeah.
bai engine
Good god
but it flies!
you're free! fly!
....
never mind
It's gonna blow up befoe it moves
I'm trying to make spyro in my fan game rotate correctly when charging depending on his direction of motion.
that was a fun noise
Right now it works when he is moving to the right, but he flips over on the back when moving to the left:P
wow lol
that must look kinda weird :p
it'll fly
...maybe
08,01wheeeeeeeeee
I say it won't
08,01wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
08,01wheeeeeeeee
yup:P
/me 08,01has been eating sugar
oh wow
lol-ed

what a takeoff
08,01so i have this box of sugarcubes
what about you?
08,01that just appeared on my desk
08,01no idea who put them there
08,01but i have sugarcubes
08,01so has a happy!
You sure it's safe? It was randomly placed on your desk.
rocketship
waht are u doing
08,01ASoftFluffyThing: OMNOMNOMNOM
rocketship
stahp
to the moon!
My question is, with all those flips, how the buck is it staying up?
Uuuuh
It's gonna---yep
Sumica, do barrel rolls, they should stabilize the...
nvm
question answered
Sylandest: Magic?
at school :/
maybe, ASoftFluffyThing
Flaps on the front engine?
irl it would rip them off
This is going to be fun
/me sits back and watches
edge* Ppfft my hearing today
this will go well
Mmm...I'm gonna cook me some sausages because breakfast
Pray little Kerbal. Pray
....?
oh...oooooh
i get it
not dead yet
if you avoid any sideward movement, it might survive
oh:/
"might"
it works
landing this thing might be interesting though
Sumica, ~15KM but you get usable thrust to 20
now the fun part begins
Yay, he rotates properly now:D
accelerating
great success!
you need to hit about 2KM/s for orbit
i'd say this plane is capable of orbit
How do you plot a trajectory angle?
DocSane, you use the map and eyeball it
yay! :p
lol
So much for orbit.
Good afternoon everyone :)
howdy MLP_Brovakiin
That's some pretty nice height on that things
thing*
good afternoon MLP_Brovakiin
gtg cya
cya
lol, speedup
Eyup
you coupd probably get anywhere on kerbin with that
Good thing air friction is magically missing.
My husband thought it would be neat if you could build things in orbit. Like a space station.
Hello MLP_Brovakiin
And fly your rockets to the station.
Gold_Demona, that is one of my most desired features
It'd certainly make the space planes more useful
Awesome. =)
The land seems to be getting closer....
If only you could fly a plane like that
:O windows!
You can't restart the engines?
Gold_Demona: I think this might come in future updates
no fuel, DocSane
DocSane, you can but theres no fuel left
That'll be cool. =)
Hey sumica in the cock pit view it looks like starfox64 style
Oh, well.
You could still run the AC
We already got other planets, and that by itself is a pretty nice goal.
Straight drop
turn the radio on
Gold_Demona, theres a mod right now that allows for orbital construction, you have to fly parts to within 10KM of it and transfer
then when you try to launch a rocket from kerbin theres a way to launch it from space instead
kerspash
That's pretty cool. Not sure if I wanna mess with mods though
Seriously?
kerbalsplash?
splash*
yay
what the
close one
again!
wheeee!
Okay.
like a baws
hey, he lived
Did he live?
progress
He lives!
Gold_Demona, what i want is orbital construction using eva
Luckiest alien EVER
He does NOT want to die
then he got eaten by the kraken
He's alive!
And scared out his poor pants
today in scchool I learned what a PLOT is ...
lol
Call for a tow-ship
Lil_B: orly?
Sylandest PLOT =Porous layer open tubular columns
lol. Hey, do all the kerbals have the surname "Kerman"?
08,01>
Lil_B: that would be PLOTC
Lil_B: thats what ive always been saying! But nopony would listen to me!
what the game REALLY needs is more information on your orbit
Lil_B: Today is school I got a detention for shouting "Tis' a lie!" in royal canterlot voice at an other student :P
you can rendevous with other craft, but its very dificult
HoodyNinja|School I know, the book still says PLOT though , the tubular columns is basicly one word
Swat Kats! i loved that cartoon! :D
Lil_B: That is too funny. The only reason im not laughing is because im too damn tired
You may want to repostion the landing gear.
mornin folks
ello Dken2021
Good morning Dken2021
hia Dken2021
monring
Morning, Dken2021
morning*
Okay, I'm all set to fly away to Atlanta for a week.
Hiyo Dken2021
yeah more slaps
Don't none of you steal my stuff while I'm away.
flaps
DocSane cool, what are ya gonna do there?
Nooooo! Don't go to Atlanta! Their airport sucks! D:
Actually, no it doesn't. It's just huge
DocSane: Don't burn anything while you're gone
Dken2021: Anime Weekend Atlanta. I'm a guest this weekend.
Heya everypony!
holy shite
screeeeech
physics?
oh wow
awesome DocSane
We don't need no physics
Hope you have a blast, DocSane. =)
Dken2021: And I get to host ANOTHER pony panel this year.
Hyea TheMonstaMuffin
sweet
hi TheMonstaMuffin
DocSane well hope you have a blast in atlanta
Hi ASoftFluffyThing And Lil_B
Dken2021: Thanks. I shall.
and now you fall
oh, I see that kerbals are green after all
Sumica, yeah, the controls on spaceplanes are bugged hard
Oh, I have to tell you all about something funny that happened on Saturday.
I hoped that little guy skipped a meal.
and it doesnt recalculate if you stage, so dropping control surfaces breaks controll of the craft
I volunteered to help out with a food truck festival, meaning I got to help with line control all day.
Kick ass
So, I'm working one line and I see a young guy in a T-shirt with Luna's cutie mark on it.
So, when he gets up to me, I look him over and then quietly say "So, I see you're a fan of Princess Luna."
Like a swan
How is this possible?
There was a moment of confusion, followed by "Yes, I am. And I'm so happy someone recognized this.
HoodyNinja|School: magic
never though I see a space plane do a dog trick
You can do it!
The space plane has a new found hate for gravity
silly Dken2021, planes can't beg
aw he dead
His friend asked if I ever went to the Boston meetups, to which I said no, because at my age, I have little in common with the average Brony, and me hanging out is kind of creepy.
Noooooo NOT THE WATER!
Can kerbals swim?
touchdown
In orbit, gravity always wins.
To which his friend replied "Oh, you're not NEARLY as creepy as some of the guys in those meetups.
Sumica : Make a X fighter
MLP_Brovakiin. Yes they can. :D
Gold_Demona: :P
nothing can go wrong with this
NOTHING!
of course
This design reminds me of model rocketry when I was a kid in summer camp.
This one is going to be called "The Barrel"
now, imagine this, but on fire
One guy just glued fins to a D-size rocket and tried launching it.
The results were...unpredictable.
DocSane: sounds like something my cousin would do
he's... not very smart
The saddest thing was seeing someone build a beautiful Estes Vega rocket. He launched it and it came apart in midair.
hi
ouch
ello CCCP
ohai there CCCP
hi Dken2021
Just little pieces of rocket came down.

Oh cheep 60s cartoons, so much to take advantage of.
This isnt peter parker?
Rustymeat: It is.
He seems like an actual VILLAIN in this cartoon instead of just holding a generally mild hatred for Spidey.
:o
I like how he can afford advanced robots, mutagenics and the like on an editor's salary.
I loved his Spider-Man killer robot, which had his face on a monitor in its head.
oh shiit!

Serenity
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZrklEy9ohQ

Serenity isn't there a flashcart for the 3DS out now?
Dken2021: Has been for a while, but it's old DS games

Fair enough, I am a chump and paid for it :P
http://www.creepypasta.com/white-with-red-eyes/
Are Altair, Ezio, and Connor all the same dude's ancestors, or are they all completely unrelated members of the same assassin's guild?
MLP_Brovakiin: Aww its good :3
Gold, i'm actually not sure
i think it could be both, or their all just assassins
I just started the first game, so I don't really know what goes on in the other games, other than Ezio's in them.
Why the heck haven't we seen earthbound on 3ds store yet?!

Is it the same dude using that "genetic memory" machine in all the games, or do they not show that gimmick after the first game?
CCCP, how bout no?
oh right, it was uncle
Yes, it's all Desmond Gold
Ok, than they're all his ancestors
awww
Cuz he couldn't relive their memories if he wasn't directly descended from them, right?
Gold_Demona: nope
the writers probably just named him for that scene, either way, it's still funny
He's the descendant of three assassins
Nope MadSurge: Nope he couldn't, or nope I'm wrong? :P
Gold_Demona: nope he couldn't
lol
nope
dat extra nope
also CCCP: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6ea5e061b60b1de1d3975acb163cb12c.jpg is this creepy enough?

MadSurge: Haven't come across those.
Gold_Demona: what about the beggars? :D
MadSurge: Those yes. XD
what about the guys who keep talking to you
MadSurge: I failed a "follow this guy" mission because of one. :P
for no apparent reason?
Gold_Demona: in 2 you do have money, but beggars are civilized now :D there's only minstrels who are ten times less annoying
They got in my way and wouldn't let me move forward. I lost the guy I was following as a result.
my nieghbor says my little pony should be taken off the air

05*yawn*
Wild Vynl Scratch appeared
Vynl Scratch used Bass Cannon
Why hello there Wrek
CCCP it can't rust in the way most people think of rust, but it can be oxidated I think
Heya Wrek
Isn't blood already oxidated?
That's why it's red
The iron
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYJVqpSddMM
Gold_Demona no, it's just that the... wait a sec while >>I think of the name >.<
Lil_B yummy
i got idea
oh, afk, brb ... dat internet speak -.-
and make a my little pony show
making it look like the ponys are there
you mean like make hologram ponies?
yes
I'm guessing they will all have Hs on their heads
the H stands for hologram btw
Fluttershy in shades and saggy pants=FLUTTERSWAG
theres a stream?
Gold_Demona okl, basicly the red Stuff in the red bloodcells that's transporting the oxigen in your body , has iron in it, but the green Stuff in plants that's responsible for photosynthesis also has iron in it
first time i saw my little pony fim i was like THIS SHOW IS LAME then i watched the 1st ep and when it ended THIS SHOW IS AWESOME
http://i.imgur.com/dTOpJ.jpg Borderlands 2 credits, and look who pops out in the special thanks :$
MadSurge Dat fluttershy
Yep :3
I don't know when I first saaw it... I somerhow just started to watch it XD
this video well no comment http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niJhLPRoUKA
I discovered FiM for a year ago and was love at first sight
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLsQJJUTmE
has anyone ever seen the vid called Epic Pie Time
PinkiePiePwnsYouAll I hate the comments on there -.-
PinkiePiePwnsYouAll: Eyup
I discovered MLP FIM related things quite early as it became popular even watching a few YTP's and all and then i cought on fast as i started to watch from start to finish which was at that time around mid ish season
yep, watched it
ive began to watch it 3 months ago
I blame reddit
was just out of boredom and stress for my exams
a friend of mine saw Epic Pie Time at bronycon
i began to like it and wathed 2 seasons in 2 days
Snow: was it helpful? :)
i got the dvds
season 3 is going to have only 13 eps
more specifically I blame /r/Eve :p
MadSurge: dont know
like the one with all 26 episodes PinkiePiePwnsYouAll?
Snow: for the stress I mean
yes
i got every ep
and seasn
so far
MadSurgeL for stress i dont know, but for boredom it did
is there a game anyone ever wanted to play, but never could?
i even got the leaked version of the Fighting is Magic game
PinkiePiePwnsYouAll Well two pointers avoid talking about FIMG
And S3 spoilers
PinkiePiePwnsYouAll ah, well remember it's only 13 this round because the network only asked for 65 episodes per contract
but
s1 was 25 eps if im correct right?
let me check
Morgan Freeman gona keeeeel you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDQx-guzx2s
26 i think
26, I believe.
S1 was 26 episodes
hmmmmmm.............
So was s2
yeah, then the calculation is correct
thus 52 so far
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk
season 1 some people say its 25 cuz ep 1 was in 2 parts
i say 26
Unless we consider Return of Harmony to be the true end of S1, in which S1 is 28 episodes and S2 is 24 episodes. But it still brings us back to the same total number of episodes.
When putting together an episode count, I count two-parters seperately.
But when talking about narrative, I count the two-parters as a single episode
lol, on the news
an aligator was loose in a plane
how did it get there even in the first place?
damn i told pinkie pie not to leave her pets on the plane
how big was it?
om nom nom
Animal transport plane?
maybe it crawled through the lavatory? XD
This is actually the Greatest game of all time YOU MUST PLAY NOW! http://www.secrettechnology.com/gamegame/gamegamebegin.html
dont know realy
but on the picture it looks like premature
hold on, ill send the picture of the aligator
its cool that Tara Strong who voices Twiligjt Sparkle also did the vocie of juliet from Lolipop Chainsaw
PinkiePiePwnsYouAll If you watched a ton of cartoons in the last decade shes pretty much a voice from your childhood
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: Faithful Student // Watch it Go // The Rainbow-Bash 6000 //
and princess clara from drawn together, and Numbah three's sister in KND, and Dil from rugrats...heck she was your childhood
i know she did bubbles dill pickles ben from ben 10 and hello kitty and lot more
shes been the voice of almost all my fav characters
Tara Strong is best VA
http://i.imgur.com/T3WlJ.jpg that was the aligator

Snow, that looks like a crocodile. O_o

No, man. These be city folks.
Dat guys face.
D:
I'm trying to remember a certain episode with a castle, where they would have a birthday party, and preparing a huge cake, but stuff happened and the main heroine would get into a journey where they go throug a marsh/Swamp and then finally a dark castle where she would meet up with another human that's pure evil.
How many places has he been kickd out of :D
dat face
Do not scare the city folk.
But I don't think it's MLP, but do you recognize any other pony franchise during the 80s?
Nope
wat
2,14 my knowledge of ponies is limited to MLP
Vordox: My Pretty Pony.
DANNG
<.<
What Kamemr? XD
...Which was turned into My Little Pony.
Are you sure it's not MLP? There's more to G1 besides the movies.
dari twice is nice, for Vals sake
oh look, it;s the crazy man, doing crazy sports
Not sure if that was in the 80s, though. Might be 70s.
Kammerjunk: "My Pretty Pony" is a short story written by Stephen King and illustrated by the artist Barbara Kruger. LAWL WHUT?
Kandarihu: I don
2,14 and it does sound like MLP
this video is making me wonder what's wrong with humanity
Caramel: Yeah but WHICH?
^^
Kurra: so many things
My Pretty Pony was indeed the predecessor of My Little Pony.
2,14 uh, that has G1 all over it
Caramel: I've been going through the whole G1-G3 episodes but its not one of them
2,14 since G1 is the only one with humans
we should totally do this
Doing that on lifts has to be the best.
And yes. My Pretty Pony existed in the 80s.
2,14 then it might have been one of the movies
Caramel: Aye, thought so, but still, all I remember is a birthday cake in the beginning, and small fluttery ponies
this gun b god
But according to Wiki, tehre is NONE of those that I remember and my sister has the VHS
please be injured....
Perhaps so rare it's not even on Wiki O.o

Makes me remember how hilarious this show was
Between the cursher, Neg, all the insufferable UK shows, and Top Gear, how does anyone have 5 seconds of peace in the UK?
It's PONIES, and there's Flutter ponies

What is a "stag" in that sense of the word, anyway?
Stag, as in male deer
Stag do
I think they call it a bachelor party.
"what the fuck is he on about" "dunno mate"
Oh. I thought it was also slang for something.
Oh how I love Britain
Permission to say cock....
MAn Digging through history I find ALL these AWESOME relics of the past that is NOT safe even today :D
it is slang for finance speculator
2,14 Kammerjunk: a "Stag Party" is another way of saying a Bachelor Party
britain, u are really unique
make no sense either
Lul
Ah, I see.
To be fair, this is paintball. They're going to get messy anyway. XD
Hahahaha
Thanks.
http://imgur.com/r/funny/7QAUJ snooki you need to die
Bachelor party doesn't sound like something where you get pissed and wake up naked tied to a lamp post
:P
^
2,14 lol
The UK can no longer make fun of the US until they exile Neg. :[
Kurra
Bronysith: I sense derp
xD
Wat
Bronysith: shes super smart
lol seriously Bronysith
We can make fun of the US because they have no Neg
2,14 Kurra: we have snooki. No amount of retard can surpass that
And Neg is a fucking beast
wat is snooki?
Neg is so fucking awesome.
Neg is a rave.
Caramel: Justin beiber, mate
Kurra, you are the hope of the future
and we have people who fuck bridges!
2,14 he's Canadian, so he can fuck off
I am? c:
>chain smoking
>running all the time
Dayum
Okay well--
OKAY
we have um...
and Britain gets neg
This guy is in great shape, all things considered.
lawl
HOW THIS FAIR?!
His lungs must be dead like, all the time.
smoking and running, a nice combination
WE HAVE STEAMED BLUE CRABS SO THERE
Kurra: for not knowing who Snooki is, yes you are :)
dat 7 magnificient
LAWL dat inhale
lol, 30 drags
is snooki a singer? wat? ?_?
Bronysith: Well, we have Villy Søvndal. That's stupidity on a government level.
43 drags before the boot
43 Serenity
Kurra: she is nothing
Dat face.
Basically, he's our minister of foreign affairs. And he doesn't speak proper English.
Dat silt bin.
Yes, FOURTY THREE
Kurra: literally she does nothing but drink booze all day long
Kurra: A bimbo in a shitty MTV program
I WANT BORIS JOHNSON ohmailuna so jealous fffffff

But this is hilarious

They aren't my lungs, so I don't care if he deos

Dammit dari, I was responding to Meanwhile
Speeeeeeeeeeeeeed toke
they are my lungs if he'S next to me
araight mate? "ur smokin" so? "it's the rules"
That cough?
Dark_Horst: He's not though?
70 drags
It's a wonder he doesn't cough his lungs out every five minutes.
wow
Meanwhile: five minutes?
So a total of over 170 drags
this is freaking funny
but for serious reals, I want Boris Johnson for my mayor X33333
I don't mind smoking as long as it's not shoved down my throat. If I insist on going places I know are not smoke-free, it's my own goddamn fault.
Ooh, this one
2,14 I'm pretty sure the ~minute spent around him race dragging wont kill you
^
Doucle unicorn.

You're just as likely to choke from laughter than from smoke
My logic
'Course not. I don't think I'll die from inhaling some smoke, I just don't like the smell.
Caramel, that minute drops your blood efficiency till you replace your affected red blood cells.
Triceratops! Fackin' sprinkles!
this is sooo goood
Ahhh, my fakkin' ribcage
Kurra: Maybe, but it will have no noticeable affect
Now see this looks like fun.
And it's not going to kill you.
FOR ME IT WILL ;_;7
2,14 he's making popularity out of being a complete asshole to people. How could I not love this?
XD
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #575
smoking doesnt kill people, people kill people
To be honest
I don't mind this. It's actually quite hilarious. :D
The entire show is about being pricks to people
Caramel: Because you're not British?
When ice cream men attack.
CCCP: smoking does kill people you dumb fuck =_=
Neg is only one of the people on it, but usually the best
The whole point of English humour is being dicks to each other, and we love it
CCCP: smoking doesnt kill people, i kill people, with guns!
deadly poisoned arrows don't kill people
and that's why I'm going till they put something else on. Or just take Neg off
/me can't breathe
/me hands Spectrum_Rush an inhaler
imma gonna die laughing
I'm REALLY hesitating if it's MLP or not.
Oh boy

EVER
AGAIN

gryphon_503125: Some things deserves to be forgotten
Vordox: like 9/11?
I'm PRETTY sure ALL THOSE GOD DAMN 70+ PARENTS are kinda angry with how his court is going
cow said it, I didn't!
nor did I imply anything about derpy's involvment
Don't mention his name in such a manner
That's all I am asking
I'm not fond of that murderers name, especailly for killing over 100 children under 16.

Fine 99% of the time
Most of the time
2,14 It depends on the genre
Hollywoods ultimate idea of a villian: get a brit to play a german.
Spectrum_Rush: That is totally wrong
2,14 If it's any kind of war movie that takes place after the 19th century, then Britain is usually "Oh those cooky allies who we have to go save"
or was that games
well in chuck a russian was the villian in one season
dat Joker
Dem nightmares
I wish jostens had pony related things to on my ring
Caramel: majority of the planning was made by the British anyways, as they had the most knowledge about that coast
Like Assasins Creed beggars everywhere.
Where does the mexican asshole hide his food?
2,14 why the hell is everyone talking about D-Day to me...?
Lunac: while D-day was important, it wasn't even the war deciding event :P
Caramel: you brought it up
Caramel: Ikr
2,14 except I didn't?
Eli... I think the liberation of continental europe was important.
they have guns and they were were using sticks
Caramel: somehow it just spawned from movie villains
Lunac: yeah, but the russians arrved at berlin even before the allies
go alfred!
I know Eli thats why I said important not vital
well hes clearly going to live
i think the vital thing that changed the war was that Hitler DIDN'T invade Britain
uh oh, we know where this is going

....Wow....that wasn't very smart of them. Now he can see them but they can't see him.
Nice logic there.
Turn out he lights... make his job harder by making it easier. dumb mexican
then again he is fat
They are in the middle of no where, suddenly they find a strange man who gets away, then bat man shows up. They don't make the connection.
Dumb villians are dumb.

Have you seen Batman Begins?
i only saw the scene with joker and batman
and it was awesome
pony_1992: no i havent
I think you'll like the joker in that movie.
2,14 >the scene with joker and batman
*scene with joker and batman on the bike
Try to watch it before Friday
twilight_sprinkle: you're in for a treat.... the joker is a sick, twisted, sadistic asshole
11,01FlutterMEDIC: No non-image links during stream.
Caramel: i know i forgot the bike part :P
2,14 I liked the part in Return of Harmony with Twilight and Discord
lol'd.
Freefall29: well yeah, that i know, i even know he kills robin at some point..
twilight_sprinkle: he's a different joker in this one, bit different from other versions
"Robin" .....Lolwut?
Freefall29: is it the same universe?
guys gotta quit making these luna pics i love em too much
im kidding by the way
vat
how the hell did those guys even get on top of the buliding so quickly anyway
dat episode title
pony_1992: his sidekick. and is it important if i dont watch batman begins?
I guess the working title for this episode "Batman vs the Kiddy Fiddler" didn't make it to air.
twilight_sprinkle: the joker in the dark knight is more of an anarchist and more serious compared to the more silly and comical joker in other versions
Well, The Dark Knight is the sequal to Rises, so yeah, you should watch it
Freefall29: ah, i see, sounds interesting
twilight_sprinkle: WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T WATCH "Batman and Robin"! its a very bad movie
Also, no Robin in those films
who else feels the dark knight rises, while good. wasent as good as the dark knight.
ah, Batman and Robin
FlutterMEDIC: lol ok, i'll remember that
Whoops, *Begins not Rises
the first batman movie i had seen
i used to have it on vhs
mineminemineminemine
pony_1992: i know his backstory tho. and i know robin isnt in the movies, i was referring to one of the animated shows
twilight_sprinkle: one reason its bad is because it has Arnold Schwarzennegar as one of the main villains -__-
The backstory is different in the new movies
FlutterMEDIC: o wait, is that the one with the bat credit card?:D
Markham is the Joker.
twilight_sprinkle: BAT CREDIT CARD!!!
twilight_sprinkle: yes. you saw the Nostalgia Critic review didnt you?

*Goes on a 5 minute rant on bat credit card*
you people do know there are better reviewers than nostalgia critic right?

speaking of bat credit card, he ALWAYS gets at least one of them at conventions
The nostalgia Critic is dead

He lasted a while before I figured it out. Joker?

the joker should have been played by Jim Carrey in the dark knight
Bat-magic:O
pony_1992: You can't break that glass
the plastic surgeon could only do so much to rebuild his face
Be patient, you'll see!
Batman must have been going unconscious. His will got him out really
Shadi: you don't say!!!
Batman keeps gadgets in other places then his belt. He's been known to keep a lockpick inside the cheek of his mask for example.

/me kidnaps AJIsAwesome
Oh just go back to the joker kid. He won't hurt you much.

the cut muscles are only in the movies i believe
Bronysith: i am. sooner or later anyways
rdibp: lol!
there was no plastic surgeon for teh comics
I mean... you are WORTH some fucking money after all.
ALL THE KIDNAPPINGS! :D
AJIsAwesome: kidnapping triangle!
And then things became complicated.

/me kidnaps Nittany_Discord OH YEAH! IM THAT BADASS!!!
05you know you have a strogn computer when you can run both WoW and Planetside 2 at the same time withotu any problems
Explosive babies :D
Bronysith: that is either insane or awesome
exploding baby...why does that make sense
Bronysith: :|
Ohi Wrek
Wrek: you luck y bastard
hi Wrek
Hai Wrek
FlutterMEDIC: Because Joker?
11,01No!
Wrek: congrats to your computer! :D
Wrek: i could do that...in the winter only
FlutterMEDIC just because.
Batman doesn't play with dolls. He only play with ponies.
/me nomz Wrek :3
:D
ACID!
oooh Wrek have you received it yet by chance?
ded
that ain't rose
Wrek, both on max settings?
now that i think about it, which pony would Batman connect with the most?
and dead?
it even made a poot noise nice
6_9
Splash
This Joker fears death too much.
don't worry. the writers will bring him back from the dead
Freefall29: he's not dead...yet.
That kid says "oh my gosh" a lot.
crap
:|
i just started watching doctor who AND IM HOOKED /)^3^(\
Meanwhile: oh my gosh, you're right
Jordan don;t form an alliance with Iran!
Meanwhile: he IS a kid and it's the mid-90's
rdash: gratz
no
rdash: which Doctor?
welp, the park is destroyed
Never liked rollercoasters.
ello everypony :)
pony_1992: probably strictly reaction. The one from the recent movies had a reason to be laughing about dieing the way he was about to die.
and then the Mayor was forlorn
Freefall29, this is DC, not Marvel comics. Character deaths are rare as opposed to inconsequential.
otakon: 9th
who keeps highlighting me
>_>
<_<
rdash: everyone loves that one and the next
Well that explains the "Top" hair cut and the suit.

Mitt Romney in a nutshell
ASoftFluffyThing: -lol Well i was onnly banned for about 10 minutes. I asked sumi to ban me permanently though and he said he couldnt do it. So I just stayed away from the site for awhile -lol
Mega_Milk: Aaah. Why'd you want to get banned?
Also I'm kind of torn with what they did with Harvey's character design.
harvey*
Gordon Freeman called
otakon: *cough cough cough* http://imgur.com/r/funny/QO9Ae
they started the raid without me?? goddamn it, i wanted the sword..
It's like they wanted him to be black but didn't.
so this shows set in the 40's right
Clock is ticking Harvey... Clock. Is. Ticking.
Bronysith: sometimes homework spills over onto weekends.
He looks like Lex Luthor
ASoftFluffyThing: Haha! I remember you now. How's it hangin my sista -lolsz
Freefall29: ikr
oh god
twilight_sprinkle: Sorry, I took it. :D
We have you surrounded yet they don;t do anything.
pony_1992: a bit, Harvey's face is longer and thinner
rdibp: o.o

Except the Batman
AJIsAwesome: nuuuuu ;_;
WHEN IS BLACK MESA SOURCE GONNA COME OUT ON STEAM!?!?!

11,01It already is out on Steam.
rdibp: its already out -_-
Excuse me, i'm Batman.
rdibp: probably when xen is out
otakon: Yeah, he looks a little different, but the similarity is definitely there
FlutterMEDIC: they greenlight it on steam
Nittany_Discord: it shows UP on STeam when you play it but it isn't available to download from there
You'd think criminals in Gotham would have learned by now.
Batman is major badass
dat pun
Mega_Milk: Doin' fine. Graduating collge this December because I failed a class last quarter.
ASoftFluffyThing: This site was getting addicting and I had things to take care of and being on bronystate was distracting.
nope :D
Hiffu- Hihhiffu- Lalalalalalalala
im batman
rdipb: go here http://release.blackmesasource.com/

:O
pony_1992: you'll find out
Derpy_Hooves: Hallo! :3
:O
well that went well
Mega_Milk: I know that feel. I could ask to be banned so I can focus on my work and starting to work out some but I can't do it, and the one time I got banned for 24 hours it drove me insane. Was a joke ban, though.
FlutterMEDIC: every time i try to download it, i won't work for some reason :(
dat akward moment when u explode for no reason
Some button
Dat breakdown
the BERSERK BUTTON!
rdibp: did you extract it?
/me presses two-face's button
see?
banning?
otakon: yep
He's a fatty
Mega_Milk: Bronystate is like my Internet Family. You guys are all insane but I love you all <3
Just be careful to not push the derpy button.
FlutterMEDIC: i dont speak computer
is that posion ivy doing the newa?
Things can get really ugly then
Bloody internet maintenance.
is that posion ivy doing the news?
It's odd how some of TV's in this show are color while some are black and white.
rdibp: look for a youtube video that will explain how to download it
Meanwhile: Bitch at your ISP
/me notes that perhaps, to assist those in studies currently, that they may request a short ban, like for finals week, for instance.
alexxm: no it's just the red hair and green pantsuit
cadence?
He's a maniaaaac, maniaaaac...
08,01heh
:/
FlutterMEDIC: i want to but......BATMAN
otakon: it is probably around that time when color tv was new
Kurra: But then I'd go nuts.
ah ok otakon
He's secret is that he'ssll kill you easi;y
Caramel: the first of the two-face episoeds?
Barbetos|AtWork: yeah maybe.
Of course the criminals are gona have the color tvs
DENT:P
then bans could only be requested.
08,01so i kinda have a crush on the guy who runs the largest my little pony store in the uk
Spitfire: eeyup it is
SirGanjalf: Close, but not close enough
what if Mitt Romney became a super villan :O:O:O
awesome
OH yeah that's right
rdibp: he aint villian material
08,01i do!
Open relationships are fun.
AJIsAwesome: Being around people like you is very very awesome -lol
rdibp: Wait, so he isn't one already?
08,01but that doesn't preclude me from having a crush on someone
:D
he's polyamoras
rdibp: Implying he isn't already
Mega_Milk: Same to you. :$
I'mma poof out for a while now. c ya later,maybe...
or however you spell it
Rule 43: The more beutiful and pure a thing is - the more satisfying it is to corrupt it.

dat button is sensitive
Also I missed the 1000th Sumica kick DAMMIT!
I wanted to be here for that
Mega_Milk: And you're a very good person, despite what your nick might intend :D
rdibp: this was more targeted towards teens
who was Sumica's 1000 kick?
otakon: Ask him to reset the kicks so that way you'll get first kick?
MadSurge: Oh God thanks for reminding me :\
ASoftFluffyThing: -lol yeah breaking away from this place was anything but easy. I regularly got check ups on bronystate with sumi on steam and DA -lol
ASoftFluffyThing: lol no I missed the 1000th kick
possibly condescending Bruce Mane....
oh that Bruce
It's funny because Batman
^
Like the fact that I see floating ponies in the room.
otakon: :D the meme is not as bad as the actual comic, trust me :D
^^
Sumica: LOL
Dat kick.
how to keep a secret... ie: I'm batman fool
otakon: Happy now?

Mega_Milk: I actually have one of my friends making one of those 'My anti-drug' things for me, but mines is going to say BronyState: My Anti-Drug
._.
Goddammit that voice is scary as hell
Why does swapping personalities change his voice again?
Time for backstory
lol at that picture shibaru
Oh hey look, it's Mrs. Exposition.
This place is so addicting. :D
hello
I like how two face here is instead multipersonality disorder.
hi, FlutterAppleRainbowT
I could do the Two-Face voice, but it would destroy my throat.
magmablock: half of him was burned by acid, which i think affected half of everything in his body
ASoftFluffyThing: haha ok but careful. To much and you might get pony withdrawl and break out in the shakes -lol
magmablock: no idea but your tone of voice changes when you're upset or excited doesn't it?
Nah, just curious
shes taking this surprisingly well
his face creeps me the fuck out
How about a nice padded Arkham Asylum.
Mega_Milk: Oh, I can deal with pony withdrawals because I don't watch ponies much except for the movie nights. But being away from Bronystate ITSELF.....That is the challenge, my friend
for the 90s this had great animation
yeah agreed ASoftFluffyThing
There's a RED Spy in the base!
FlutterMEDIC: I still think it has great animation
alexxm: Maybe she works in Arkham...
The woman in red... powerful symbol.
FlutterMEDIC: this is my childhood man
A RED SPY IN THE BASE!?!?

GET THIS OFF MY LAPTOP!
2,14 kidzrul434: exactly. Maybe next time you don't like what's on stream, you can politely mute it until something else is on, rather than throw a temper tantrum like a child
