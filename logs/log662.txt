/me checks
I guess there are three ways school cirriculum can be handled in anime, each less common than the one before it. Filler, thematic, or plot critical.
ok time for sleeps
I'd say that the lesson on composing kanji from radicals is thematic.
I know you hate them :P

DISINTEGRATED
And he lives!
I told you the ship would tear apart.
he had fun
The cockpit is undamaged!
I'm laughing for real right now :D
At first Lambro Kerman was like :O and then he was like :)
it is
put alottashit on da back
Oh, I see.
6_9
but in a vacum its more than twice as powerfull as any other engine
well, twice as efficent
still only a piddly little 60 thrust
the thrust must be over 9000!
my bill crashed into duna
jebs stuck on eve
ikr!
I can see everything from in here! :D
lol
its like ork tech
wow...first person view?
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
damnit
:D
We're gonna need another Bill!
though the only control that works afaik is the throttle
Wee!~
Takeoff! :O
lol
XD
they fly entirely by feel
and it falls
wont pull up XD
bye bill
pull up!
its gona be close
DED
We're gonna need another Bill!
nooooooo!
ded
Make one with 30 engines
:D
add a fuel tank
you cant place the aerospike engines on tri couplers
it really anoys me
Heya ponies
i've not managed it
XD
neved got to see that one
Oh my gosh
well it was inevitable
is that version 0.17?
we really do need a land vehical based version of this
thank ye
MORE ENGINES!
o.o I look away for 2 minutes and I see this
MORE PONIES
should work
everyone
huh... it doesnt explode
it works
Uh oh
and loud
Lots of rockets. Of course it's loud. :P
outta gas
this concept is worth following
^ :D
minimum is just under 150 iirc
hmmmm
dang, nittany isnt here
need to be 20% more engines
I has a nittany zebra
http://derpy.me/J3Dl8
D'awwww
lol wut
o.o It's working? :D
nvm
lol uh oh
weeeeeeeeeee
lol, Why is he outside?
Did he try to abandon ship?
HE'S ALIVE! :3
jool'
I've got it!
alright, it seems to be satire
MORE ENGINES :D
MOAR
NOT ENOUGH ENGINES
http://derpy.me/ensK1
Only half? o.o
no no no MOREENGINE FIRST
:D
how is this working
Nooooo! The rockets my husband made aren't compatible anymore! D:
:'(
close
spin stabalized
up to 4x
also parachutes have gotten a little more fragile
Cuz I don't remember how these ones were made...
The free version, yes
Yeah, I stuck them in the VAB folder
you can force the rockets in by changing a line in the file
but the become mutilated monstrosities
MORE FUEL AND ENGINES
needs moar everything
They bounced off the edge of the universe. :<
Wow! That's a lot of fuel!
yeah, tricoupler abuse
i'll send the .craft over if you want to try
those rockets that are two rockets
18 engines.
:/
NOT ENOUFF
LOL
hello everyone
ololololo
IT'S ALIVE
Well it's still safer then aircanida :/
we lost some bits
soo close to surviving
Oh, and facial hair. He has a moustache and goatee.
gtg
clipped parts are fun, when they are part of the same craft or bit of debris they dont collide, but if the become seperate parts when you seperate they do
woah stable
not for long
http://imageshack.us/a/img441/1025/xaxpone.png
More engine always works.
XD
lol
lol :D
and are those eylashes?
just don't do vibrent
also time warp sometimes breaks chutes
and try to make something fit?
/me looks at stream "that cant be safe"
pfft whatever
The most colors
3-4
for ap ony.
derp, wrong tab
not aware of any hotkey to switch the thing
See! more engines more stability!
Yeah, lol
this is gona be fast
that must be kerbin escape
oh come on
very close though
Lolwut
o_o
Yay!~
Wtf :D
too long and you can walk off wearing the thing
Oh o:
Omg!
thats a problem i keep having in my designs too
bye

Not enoff.
:3
:D
Drink drink drink drink!
And now I want a soda... *goes to the kitchen to grab one*
not sure if ffsplit or limev thats at fault
LOL
More engine?
XD
Oh geez, this can only end in awesome. XD
wrong way!
INB4: VOOM
*BOOM
IT's COMING AT US!
:/
Bahahaha!~ :D
Ha! :D

HOW IS IT STILL GOING
Ill be honest.
Thats kinda awesome -lol
i managed to use this as a parachute once
not like this
its like a blimp
EXPLODEINATE
except made of wings
How do you think the kerbals in control feel right now?
oh yeah if you oscilate left and right it accelerates
lol
:D
Acceleration is magic
PHYSICS ARE NOO MORE
ksp dont know how to physics XD
00,10wth is this, a text file?
why didja give it to em then
is .craft file o_O
00,10i opend the link you gave and got a page with text
strange
if we could see more to the right it would be stream-seption
its odd that dropbox does this
Alright I'm back, are we still watching Kerbals die? :3
i usualy listen to my own music while this is going on but with the voice i can't
i could probibly work arround the background music though
Time for school.Later everypony ._.

Oh no. I see where this is going.
:D
And spinning
I foresee lots and lots of spinning
KSP and 'splosions? Naaaaaaah
Yeah, I can ee where this is going. :o
i'm actually expecting the wings to fly ogg
off'
LOL
XD
PFFT
lol
It fell apart
it didnt fall apart

Off screen explosions. I just imagined that controll finally got exploded instead
Yes, to assume makes an "ass" of "u" and "me"

K-O
then screw with them?
XD
AWESOME desktop....
where'd you get it??
0.17 feels less stable than the older releases
ive never played Mass Effect
i've got plenty of memory and it crashes anyway
and i have just seen the spaceship from star trek
but the normandy (thing from desktop) is from mass effect
Its not important
very different shows
3 peeps
yesh but they are both Si-Fi
But hardly the same thing. :P
NAH
dat retrograde orbit
time travel is a common thing now ever since it was created
they are screaming
lol
If Jeb was there, he'd be laughing instead.
WEEEEEEEEE
crap i was in the back
this craft is designed for mun landing but i've not bothered to get it there
XD
no asas
not having asas is silly
they have flat faces
yeah
and you can drag it from the iva
look at the clock
XD
yeah it is
thats the ground radar above the artifical horizon
or in this one the direct left
stow away?
he is sittin in the trunk
That is his only warning
When did that happen?
:D
Hahaha
that looked cool
or is gonna
WUT

falling out of the world?
they're fine
awww :'(
whyyyy
Now is the time for you to launch it, launch it launch it, launch it... o/~
cause its monday/sunday
:'( meanie
we are playing sshh
let us take a moment of silence for whoever it gonna be in this ship
I'm the world champion, bet you cna't beat me.
I thought Fluttershy was the world champion. O_o
no angel is
he NEVER MAKES A SOUND
i actualy have confidence in this craft
except for that one time he coughed
oh yeah
like that?
Seems legit
T-Rex's in F-14's

?
it really was lacking power
lol umm.....
Bwoing

He lived!

i just saw them comeing together then i was like "NOOOOO"
it needs to be faster
How is he still alive?! :D

LOL
They're actually support struts. :P

Aah, here's the problem... TOO MANY TOASTERS
blasphemy
needs more blenders
:D
it needs streamers
ded
I agree
Streamers and balloons
add some speed holes
never could build planes this awesome
How about some french haute couture too?
this ship just needs one of everything
:D
well
AND THEN
SPLASH
and then vanished
lol
ded
To the cloning machine!
two more engines?
this well end well

you have to drop it before takeoff
use more gun
and here we go

Bad poker face
spacecraft
it touches the ground
Aww the Kerbals are sooo cute walking down there. It looks like they're waddling
Oh silly kerbals. They try to explode loose debris instead of cleaning it up.
this is kerbin
lol
hm...
inb4 it explodes
great success
D:
lol
XD
lol
stable?
dat stability
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/image/846
'Cuz I think the rockets are still going to be needed for that.
allah akbar!!!
It looks like it's spazings
should i be concerned that its freaking out?
can't stop laughing
>pefectly stabl design
>looks like it's swimming
Why canards AND a rear stabilizer?
http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maeyqxuHQC1rrck2e.gif
Its aparently a DOTA thing.
I guess champions are the name they give "heroes" and LoL

i played dota for some time, not the second one tho

Dump the rear stabilizers and give it a vertical one.
we might make it
maybe
...probably not

never mind
It's gonna blow up befoe it moves
that was a fun noise
Right now it works when he is moving to the right, but he flips over on the back when moving to the left:P

if you avoid any sideward movement, it might survive
oh:/
"might"
it works
landing this thing might be interesting though
now the fun part begins
accelerating
great success!
you need to hit about 2KM/s for orbit
i'd say this plane is capable of orbit
How do you plot a trajectory angle?
lol
Good afternoon everyone :)
That's some pretty nice height on that things
thing*
gtg cya
cya
lol, speedup
Eyup
you coupd probably get anywhere on kerbin with that
Good thing air friction is magically missing.
Awesome. =)
The land seems to be getting closer....
If only you could fly a plane like that
You can't restart the engines?
That'll be cool. =)
Oh, well.
You could still run the AC
We already got other planets, and that by itself is a pretty nice goal.
Straight drop
turn the radio on
atmospheric friction heat would be nice
kerspash
That's pretty cool. Not sure if I wanna mess with mods though

How is this possible?
You can do it!
Can kerbals swim?

To which his friend replied "Oh, you're not NEARLY as creepy as some of the guys in those meetups.
nothing can go wrong with this
NOTHING!
of course
This design reminds me of model rocketry when I was a kid in summer camp.
This one is going to be called "The Barrel"
The results were...unpredictable.

There can't be enough fuel for all those engines.

He's the descendant of three assassins

and make a my little pony show
you mean like make hologram ponies?
yes
Fluttershy in shades and saggy pants=FLUTTERSWAG
theres a stream?
first time i saw my little pony fim i was like THIS SHOW IS LAME then i watched the 1st ep and when it ended THIS SHOW IS AWESOME
Yep :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPLsQJJUTmE
has anyone ever seen the vid called Epic Pie Time
yep, watched it
ive began to watch it 3 months ago
I blame reddit
i got the dvds
season 3 is going to have only 13 eps
more specifically I blame /r/Eve :p
yes
i got every ep
and seasn
And S3 spoilers
but
let me check
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDQx-guzx2s
26 i think
26, I believe.
S1 was 26 episodes
hmmmmmm.............
yeah, then the calculation is correct
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tyvJJzSDk
season 1 some people say its 25 cuz ep 1 was in 2 parts
i say 26
When putting together an episode count, I count two-parters seperately.
But when talking about narrative, I count the two-parters as a single episode
lol, on the news

how did it get there even in the first place?

'Course not. I don't think I'll die from inhaling some smoke, I just don't like the smell.

Ahhh, my fakkin' ribcage
Now see this looks like fun.
And it's not going to kill you.

smoking doesnt kill people, people kill people
To be honest
I don't mind this. It's actually quite hilarious. :D
The entire show is about being pricks to people
Neg is only one of the people on it, but usually the best
deadly poisoned arrows don't kill people
and that's why I'm going till they put something else on. Or just take Neg off

well how often do murder sprees come up? Should I be worried?
nor did I imply anything about derpy's involvment
Don't mention his name in such a manner
That's all I am asking
I'm not fond of that murderers name, especailly for killing over 100 children under 16.

He's NOT mute, though.
Well they think he is, because he won't talk to them
