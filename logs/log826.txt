spitfirecolt: 3 week
Ah Wrek and his heavy metal
I liked the episode because of the natural dialogue between the Mane 6.
at least its better wait then 6 months
Spike will always be best pony.
I never get tired of it
i can't beleieve we are almost done with this season
13 episode
the episodes are flying by fast
Seriously.
It's episodic this season. There really isn't anything where you need to have seen the previous episodes.
00,103 weeks gap followed by last 4 eps
i hope for another season i don't want it to end that
Ehh
S3 isn't the best
00,10then to be imeadeatly followed by mass drinking of the specal kool-aid
Except Magic Duel, I guess. I never watched the first season, but the fandom talks about Trixie so much that I... Get the idea.
inb4 speculation on S4 :p
Gak!
lol
GameTaco: it is just fanservice ep
Basically, yeah.
They already gave hints that they have stuff planned for MLP
i made so many new friends because of the show i am afriad we will not hang out anymore when the show ends
00,10and with that I go to sleep

All S3 did was made a few things canon

Hello Everypony
nite sumica
Night Sumica
hello Lightning_Wing
00,10Wrek awsome looking tavi, sorry I cant stay up

Well... Magic Duel was planned for Season 2, so I'm not sure it was fan service.
watching wrek draw, while mining ice
-_-
It was planned for Season 2?
Is that an orange cello?
Yeah.
Wrek: Are you using iTunes for the Music?
So... Trixie got backburnered.
gonna go make some lunch, maybe play some xbox...:O SHINEDOWN~
yet i feel derpy was left out this season
hey everypony! whats going on? :)
ugh....
In that regard, season 3 feels like a sort of season 2.5. Everything they couldn't cram into the 26 episode norm.
hello AssertiveFluttershy watching Wrek draw
spitfirecolt: considering last seasons controversey, not surprised
season 4 will have 15 episodes i thank

Season 4 will have ponies. I just blew your mind.
it is thats episode 10 not 11
Yeah, they seem to be focusing on other background ponies to, well, put in the background. It keeps things interesting.
thought so
That is starting to look like an awkward position
':P
In the season finale, it will be revealed that everypony is Bon Bon.
that Octi + this song = :( dem feels
if it was me as head writer i would make a lyra and bob bob episode about lyras love for humans

spitfirecolt: She does have an voice though.
Definitely a Trottingham accent.

I FREAKING LOVE IT
And this fancy keyboard that is heaven to type on :D

Shame on you, bro, its a priviledge to get to watch this!
So if it already exists, just replace it right?

...
i'm a moron..

^
Hey SR. Any suggestions on a new keyboard?

What's OllyDbg?
I've neve heard of it
Will you teach me to Futbol?
*never
i dont think you speleld that right
I was joking
It's a debugger
-_-
oh haha
.-.
brb

You put binaries or libraries in it and it disassembles it
How ironic is this?
dat name :s
God, I love the designwork.
"i dont think you speled that right"
"speled"
MLP_Brovakiin: Ikr?
0,14also, MoistPonyNips, mind chaning your name to something more...appropiate?

Did you see the new episode yet SR?
hello everyone, did I miss anything </luna>
It got leaked last night apparently
I dont watch em in the morning.
LOL
no
Just this magnificent work of art.
from itunes
Anyway, you got any suggestions SR?
suggestions for what
<3
A keyboard
yeah have to say this looks awesome
waiting for movie night
Steam, why you empty my wallet so fast :<
My current one is dying
yeah, I was thinking that too
what did i do? :(
IBM model m
cause its a auction
it's happened way too many times now to be an accident
Okay
Mostly because I have nothing to spend.
Hello everypony.
Just play Team Fortress 2. Free-to-play, and fun.
I mean something that isn't 30 years old
me neither
Oh hi, pyrocatboy.
Ohai pyrocatboy :)
yo
hai
Welcome. pyrocatboy
I just got "They Bleed Pixels" and "The Walking Dead"
whats the first one?
oh wait
i have the internet
hello pyrocatboy
nvm
I have 2987 internets.
You probably don't have to put that much thought into a brand of keyboard, do you?
Its like a combat/precision platformer that is fun and simple. but hard
0,14oi, MoistPonyNips, second warning, change your nick
Yes
I do
they're all pretty much the same
http://pckeyboard.com/page/category/UKBD
brand new
Okay everypony, I'm going to change my nickname.
in lovecraftian style
Woah what
always when i ask my parents something, they say 'google it'
and they're not even that expensive
They make them new?
gunna lose those internets
I'm loving this Cello Wrek
lovecraftian style is best style
...
yes they are the most popular keyboard amoung programmers.
back
hai
I dunno man, steampunk is pretty awesome too
wb ^^
steam punk
I'm back.
I'm not sure if I want a buckling spring though
It's MoistPonyNips.
hmmm
I like mechanical keyboards.
hai Predator
wb to you too ^^
steam punk plus lovecraft
I do too
if you dont care for them, just grab whatever one you find at bestbuy.
People still uploaded it though
steamcraft or lovepunk
XD
...
that name made me think of that milk pony
Bubblepunk.
im glad i came today. now i have something to replace this crappy gimp
Feelin' lucky, punk.
does anyone here have an oc?
bronystate: who the fuck just farted
That's what I'm askin'.
eeyup
I'd prefer brown or blue mechanical
I don't even use itunes and I watched it already
me
hoof hearted
Hell, I wouldn't know what I'd use an OC for.
evryone has an oc
I use itunes on my phone
Roleplay?
I don't. I am not creative enough
But because its convinent.
my oc's called melody :D
where did wrek pull that steam punk art from?
I don't have one. all the good color schemes are taken, and I don't want to be unoriginal.
I would not pay $79 for a keyboard
ah steam punk chello
I don't draw, I cannot into music, I only write for fun, and I wouldn't RP as a single character.
You would if it was sick
Nope
I never would
The only creative thing I do is mess around in Blender and 3ds Max.
I would because I like to use the same keyboard for a long time because I get used to it.
brb
matttheshadowman: wat!?
I'm using an apple aluminum one right now
Ive been using shitty keyboards for a long time and I always replace them every few months because they start to suck
That is one fancy cello
I regularly switch between two completely differently sized laptops
so I have no trouble adjusting to keyboards
for a fancy pony
It's nice, but it's not mechanical
Hello everypony.
I like Appletavia.
the cello is preeeeeeeeeeeetty :)
yo
well he had his Tardis on a cloud where he was living for a while
matttheshadowman: loved the episode
DJ-T4VI is best ship.
:-O
I hate the thin apple ones, I dont mind the thin keys when im on my laptop, but for a desktop… no.
I had no idea people even thought this much about keyboards. XD
I thought the pegasi gave him that cloud
I like the thin keys, but I hate this keypad
What's for Movie Night?
Not sure how clock gears fit into music, but alright
I like to eat at my computer too so my keyboards tend to get all gross after a short period of time.
I want a tenkeyless
A move is Wall-E
my earplugs are donut-earplugs... so actually, i have donuts in my ears?
If I needed one I'd just buy the cheapest one at Target
Conyst: yeah me too, did you find the Doctor a bit mopey in this though?
Any advantage of a PS/2 over a USB?
no
Other than, like, pressing 50 keys at once
really?
matttheshadowman: it was completely understandable that he was mopey
I dunno, as long as I can type with it, I'm good
...
The Doctor being mopey is normal, plus hello everypony
has this dude even looked at a chello once since we started this feed?
Never learned about keyboards in any of my classes
my tv-box thingy doesn't want to turn on -.- whaa! hate that!
soulrider95: i think they mad spike a bit too incompetent
Hi everypony :)
matttheshadowman: although I think we should stop talking about the new Doctor Who episode
Well there are essentially 2 main types of keyboards
im gunna go sit in an unartistic corner for a while
yo
The ending looked like David and the goliath to md.
after all spoilers
soulrider95: i think it was sort of dull. I mean it was written by Merriweather Williams what did you expect?
hello Angel_Twilight_Song
Cheapy cheap boring china made common pathetic plastic keyboards
I found the character interactions the only redeeming part.
There were many holes in the plot.
And mechanical keyboards
maybe hes a duel screen user
wait so faust didnt make it
I wasn't a fan of the CGI either.
Brady Bunch and Spongebob did it better.
if you wanted to.
Remember all the other times Spike's life was saved by the other ponies? There was no mention of the Dragon
yea the writing seemed almost awkward and choppy
Well I would believe that
are we talking about plot holes in a kid's show again?
Code at all. It all suddenly appeared...
This song reminds me of something from Descent.
at least we know now that Rainbow Dash writes fanfics
:D
the question is why though? :P
the CGI just stuck out horribly. IMHO
Particularly Descent 3.
Alchemist: sadly yes
Because of the feel
I have no issues with my cheapy cheap boring china keyboards
Do you know it?
im giving it an meh 2.5
Do you know that feel bro?
I don't know that feel bro
sorry
Predator: Negative Continuity. THis episode culd have happened before any of those.
i think the new episode deserves a 7/10
good equipment can increase your productivity.
Well, Alchemist, I think that the writers are leaning towards writing for us Bronies.
Yea
Predator: they only started learning about dragons not to long ago. He probably did not know of it before.
the episode was funny, but the so-so writing made it hard to take seriously anyways
And yes, Cajun, that is entirely true. Didn't think about that.
I don't think writing for the bronies is a good idea...
Predator: I didnt notice that in any way...
Secret of my Excess?
I have a very hard time believing that my work will magically become better because of an expensive keyboard
Angel_Twilight_Song: well it was written by Merriweather Williams
but okay
You will type faster
I wont become better.
it*
Because your keyboard sucks less
And you will get all the chicks
If your a shitty programmer, no amount of equipment will make it any better.
i wanna play sims so suddenly..
..
...
Why would I want chicks? :P
To sell to meth.
I would not have the patience to draw this.
I probably want them about as much as you do Everto
rdibp: Yea Mw's episodes are usually the ones I'd call "average" because most mlp episodes are above average :)
Are you saying
You don't want
chicks
i wanna watch lunar eclipsed again
http://narciejeter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/baby-chicks.jpg
have no problem with merryweather williams either, she wrote quite some nice episodes.
Look at them
Not really
Im to picky to draw something this advanced.
So watch it. It's on Youtube.
they'll grow up into chickens
You are satan
and then what do I do
I want another Luna episode
i wish it displayed song title next to his logo
I still want a Celestia and Luna ep....
Fine
You will get all the souls
Yea Meriwether Williams had been on a really good episode streak, but this episode kinda threw it off
I think Merriweather's best episode is Wonderbolt Academy
Last ps2 rolled off the assembly line.
Who do you guys think is a powerful singer?
hearths warming eve was good too
Yea
I never owned a ps2.
Shed a tear man
and dragonquest
sweetie belle duh
Because they're done
Discorf ep
nooo
Oh god, Dragonquest is still my favorite Episode.
More done than a steak at a crappy restaurant
Now I might have to buy a new console
The feel, the adventure, and Rarity
I just think that in this episode spike was kinda out of character.....
And you ordered it medium rare, but the chef is an idiot
the timberwolves cgi was what took season 3 to long
mine is green is not your color
soulrider95: the episodes were already finished mid summer I think
i love photofinish
I like to think I am not a shitty programmer
:P
derpy_h whos Discorf?
I never claimed you were, i was just making a point about equipment.
I'm a pretty shitty programmer
Photofinish? You mean RD? Hurr hurr hurr
discord*
hi ho is everypony
Or at least I think I am
...
Your a shitty /ruby/ programmer.
I've never really compared myself to a non shitty programmer
yo
hello linkkirby
Who is Ho? And when did he/she become everypony?
bo
I don't program in Ruby
brb again
hi
I know

So you don't actually think Ruby on Rails is awesome?

Now I don't have to hold a grudge
I only know, like, half a dozen languages
Decalbuuuuuurg
And what's it matter anyways
:)
I've done like, 5 things combined
fight scene was great, the fake timberwolf scene was funny, the scene at Rarity's was good... I really think it was a good ep
back
me have shiba inu puppy right now in hands its hard to type
evenin' everypony
So yea, keyboards
Hey SirGanjalf
Keyboards are boring
:<
And no letter to Celestia at all.

I liked the 3D CGI
Hello SirGanjalf your late
i havent sen the ne ep yet D:
You're boring
hi
Ohai SirGanjalf :)
Alchemist: what fight scene? you mean when Spike threw a rock at the timberwolf? yeah, that was sooooooo epic
you will not convince me otherwise
back
Your face is boring
hi sirganjal how are you
Ikr?? Spike didnt write a letter.
and I know
:(
Your mother's face is boring
05that went well
rdibp: nope, the one at the beginning 6_9

Angel_Twilight_Song: Fun fact: Before making the film, the developers watched every Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton film for lunch. Every day. For a year and a half. They did so to inspire the possibilities of pure visual storytelling.

kidzrul732 No they wont because they are in equestria and earth is a different planet entirely.
For example, Eve's sleek design looks like an evolution of the boxy Apple II design.

That is, Wall-E.
No cross, this is Patrick.

Angel_Twilight_Song: Those poor, ponylesss fat people
A world of Gabens
I would hate to be a tattoo artist
so many fluffy ppl
i bet episode 3 isnt even out yet
Angel_Twilight_Song, Disney doesn't have the rights to that. Let's pray they never do.
first of all I cant draw

EPIC_luna: Looka like regular muricans
BnL destroyed MLP in order to take over the world

second of all, no erasers.
Wb derpy_h
Us in 800 years scare it ain't it?

FAT MAN DOWN
well you draw it in pen first I think
Welcome to Earth 2, after 500 years in development hopefully it'l be worth the weight.

I know that voice, cant remember the name
Hey John Ratzenburg
then you outline what you drew
MAN DOWN
Or you will miss tha party
he's made of JELLO
somebody help this poor man!
He's like a fat bug on his back

I like the evironmentally aware message they are sending in this movie
that would make sense.
dat John Ratzanburg
daaww
and then he died
indoctrination!
Did you know I saw this on earth day?
J_E_Smith71: It's entertainment.
LUNCH-IN0A0CUP
Ratzenburg is considered Pixar's lucky charm.

kidzrul732, "environmentally aware"? LOL
blue!!!
John Ratzanburg: The Voice of Pixar himself.
Buy n' Large? More like "Butter n' Lard">_>
So yes, the name of the ship is the Axiom. In math, an "axiom" is something unquestionable or something taken for granted.
Ooh, blue!
i liked blue before it was cool
All must be blue
Red team forever
Kandarihu It showed that the planet was covered in trash

It may be blue. But it's no Zinthos

Scary thought: What does porn look like for the inhabitants of this ship?
:O

Many of the robots in this film are voiced by one man: Ben Burtt. When Andrew Stanton, the director of Wall-E, met with Burtt, he told him "I need you to be 80% of my cast!"
GET UP
2775
DAT VOICE!!!!!!!!!! never heard it!!
...

I like the camera in the film. Pixar decided that it should look like it was shot with a regular Panavision camera.

Twilight would go crazy. No Books in existance?
dafug book??
Aww
that was easy
In fact, for the filmic look, the animators brought in some vintage Panavision cameras from the 1970s. Just because Pixar has some of the most dedicated sons of mothers in animation.
CONGRATS YOU CAN READ!

I think Pixar was a bit optimistic with the the time, though. While not mentioned in Wall-E, it's said in the animated short BURN-E in the DVD extras that this film takes place in 2805 AD.
dahell
Where are all of the defective turrets being kept?

Dead, not big suprise!
Escape pods dont self destruct O_o

rdibp: Pixar typically takes about 4-5 years on a movie, start to finish.
And they put a auto self destruct sequence, why?
NOO
Using an escape pod, with self distruct, to ged rid of one little plant seems a BIT excessive.

rdibp: Well, the concept for Wall-E came from the famous lunch in 1994. From this lunch was born Wall-E, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo. However, production of this film wasn't until after Stanton completed Finding Nemo in 2003.

TrixieMuffin: Wouldn't surprise me.
This is one of my favorite scenes ever. Thomas Newman is criminally underrated...
no
TrixieMuffin: I want to see a crossover now, damnit.
Pixar is an underrated company
they aren't
Newman Thomas is underrated
and a crossover would be terrible
Spark = Kiss? Most likely.
That Fire Extuingisher is bigger on the inside. Otherwise he would have run out long ago.

A113
Dragonmatte sounds about right. That 5 year cruise is on valve time.
Every movie.
XD
...
Cyberlord1, if Disney movies exist in the aftermath of a global monopoly ruined the Earth, it's likely Buy n Large bought out Disney. They probably also bought out Valve and everything else. So maybe Half-Life 3 did come out.
Look at that. A113. In every single Pixar film.
A113
suddenly he's a villain...
skynet
And a lot of Disnet animated films.
AEIOU
open pod bay doors
he is now hiding under my bed
"I'm sorry, Captain. I'm afraid I can't do that."

JOHN MADDEN
Dat A113. It's an easter egg thing in Pixar movies.

if you could relate the characters in Wall-e to ponies, which ponies would they be?
AEIOU
Just taze him
uh oh
A113?
and then play it off
starrre
huh
TOP SECRET
what does A113 mean?
why soo much advertising
Did I miss it?
snaaaaaaaaaaaakee
Cave Johnson here
Fun fact: AUTO's directive, A113, comes from Room A113 at Cal Arts where a lot of Pixar animators learned their craft.
directive A113
VenHur: explain this to me mortal
I fell asleep on my laptop
A113 means that the g word that must not be said has taken over.
Also, look. AUTO only complied when ordered. "A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law."
Angel_Twilight_Song: WALL-E = Derpy , Eve would probably be Rarity
cleanup ass>?
Angel_Twilight_Song: Fashion bots=Spa ponies
and be fat
A113 was the room number of the classroom where John Lasseter and Brad Bird studied character animation.
i think A113 is the pixar conference room?
dat texttospeach
A113
Live fat and prosper
rdibp: No, it's a room at Cal Arts.

(Classroom at CalArts, to be clear)

Listen. That sound. Full power. Macintosh boot.

Shit, startet to think about tachikoma singing scene :'(
DerpyMuffins: Actually, compared to Eve's sleek design, Wall-E is more like the cube-y, beige design of the Apple II.
Is that cockroach a nokia?
He's not working right. How about if you turn him off and then on again? That tends to fix things.
reboot!!!! >.<

After-Movie Trivia: The painting Robot's name is VN-GO. A reference to Van Gogh. And the "Mouse" from the waste disposal scene is named REM-E. A reference to a certain other Pixar movie.
C:
God dammit, Pixar. Stop being so awesome.
:(

GET ON WITH IT
Doc Hollywood > Cars
The Enigma's review of WALL-E: This movie is just brilliant, both visual and plot driven. The characters are adorable (well, except the enemy ones) and reek charisma. The setting is wonderful, and the message they were going for was perfectly delivered. Truly an instant classic of cinema 10/10
I'd give Cars 6/10 but Cars 2 is at best a 3/10
Adblock plus work well on ustream
CRUSH KILL DESTROY
I have 7 adblockers and trackblockers. What are these 'advertisements' thou speakest of?
I can imagine the mane six singing this.
never seen cars 2 but cars wasnt too bad
I felt the problem with Cars 2 was it was focused too much on that tow truck.
Kammerjunk, have you cockblocker?
matttheshadowman: Raritydiamond ikr?
pony_6548: ...Yes.
Yaaay
well, they kinda shove their message down your throat
He killed dem guys!
RIP Justin Wright.
Kammerjunk, the stuff that keeps websites running without forcing it's users to pay for the services themselves.
i'm tired....
oh well .then it's ok
This makes me want to go play Portal 2.
Bronies which were the ones to be expected to forgive and forget: Bronies or Anons?
Cars 2 was overrated.
yes Cars 2 also seemed to want to be a James Bond spoof as well
and hungry
Like a Boss! :[
it really was
Justin Wrong got him VenHur, his evil twin.
From his evil twin family.
Kandarihu: Oh relax, I can disable them for individual sites. These ads aren't exactly helping BronyState.
matttheshadowman: they also wasted BRUCE CAMPBELL
sooo there is no derpy in season 3?
i need more soup
Actually cars 2 wasn't overrated at all, the critics panned it
cus retartds?
dang ads
The 8-bit Twinkie looks like ROB's head
more pizza plants
Kammerjunk, but they're helping Ustream.
CRUSH KILL DESTROY SWAG!
SWAG
Nope.avi
Anons are usually all trolls... well all the ones i've met have been...
goddamn can't even watch Wall-E without these people trying to shoehorn horses into everything
pony_6548: i saw her, but by the side, not her full face
I really shouldn't be complaining about it though. I have adblockplus running too.
CRUSH. KILL. DESTROY. PLANT.
matttheshadowman: Cars 2 was massively overrated. Critics should have condemed it even harder than they did
bl1tz but.. as far as I am concerned you are a anon.
So is everyone else
Hey, everypony. Enjoy the new episode earler?
*earlier
yes
I loved it :3
yep
Si.
yes
I swear tro god, if they made Cars 3, which is most likely can happens like Toy Story's, I'm going 14th Century on their sorry asses.
yeh
Next movie?
we are all Anons
It was good.
next
i always go by the name bl1tz, or bl1tzgam3r212
i hope hey make a WALL-E 2
with names
yes
Broneis are sort of descendants of Anons (the group)
overall 4/10 is pretty much condemning it.
spikexAJ is best shipping

Winter Wrap Up !
Cars 2 was a good movie. I see why a lot of people don't particularly care for it, but it's not a bad film.
Yay!
She is your mommy
Oh Wrek you skipped a gag in the Pixar logo
Angel_Twilight_Song: babies born during the production of the movie to production crew memebers
Who said imperialism is bad?
Angel_Twilight_Song: its the babies of the makers who were born during the production of the movie
basically
who is his mommy?
Winter wrap up you say??
YEAHH
Lightning_Wing: WALL-E as a trillogy...No thanks. I prefer as a standalone, Up too.
It's gonna get stuck in my head again...oh no
VenHur: Yeah, ditto.
Twi you look so adorable dressing up
^
dat saddle
its bullshit
^^^
lol
YAY!!!! One of my fav eps... the song was one of the reasons i love this show so much!
awh man,she reminds me of one of my ocs Starbeam
Finding Nemo 2. How will that work?
TOO early.........:D
matttheshadowman: They gone bankrupt, but someone is going to buy them
There aren't any humans in Equestria, so the saddle is probably kind of kinky.
wheres the snow?
Wow, animation did improved noticeably since S1.
Fuffy saddle is fluffy
Hundreds of Years. Granny Smith is older than Ponyville. Granny Smith is hundreds of years old.
LOL
AHHHHHHHHH
Too early they didn't draw the snow yet
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH
That always makes me laugh.
i like how she wear nothing at all but saddle
0,14which is why I was basically just watching movie without chat
well all horses really do...
The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about the episode: CG Timberwolves.
But as for the Incredibles, most likely, because at the end of the film, they're about to fight The Underminer.

Still what has THQ got these days lastv game I got with vtheir name on it was Conker's Bad Fur Day on N64 in the UK (THE Games or Nintendo UK wouldn't publish it here)
05i can see why they did it and its perfectly reasonable
@VenHur: wished it didn't end at a cliffhanger
Take care, frisbeehat
though the brotherly combination Timberbot was funny
Wrek: i didn't spoil anyth---OH, OK

Thanks Shizuka for defending me.
10:21 PM here
fine :(
That's what i'm wondering shizuka.
deerper
Shizuka: Should of said "WHAT THE HELL WITH WRONG WITH YOU/THEM?!".
13Why would you ever, EVER, think making a joke about rape is funny or acceptable?
your cursing is offensive to some people too.
hey Shizuka ! whats the point of a plushie
only for 400$ you can buy the same
Shizuka: Tell that to Adam Sandler then...
why is there an apple program on my laptop
Shizuka: IKR? it's unnaceptable and inexcusable......Spoony learned it the hard way.

not just "adblock noob lawl"

NO. MY CELLPHONE WIIL STAY ON!
shh! The show's about to start!!!
Shizuka, it's hard for me to fathom too. Maybe it's just the audacity of it all.
No.
13If they don't know how to use Google, I have no sympathy for them.
exactly
Oooo
Shizuka: That, or they're must be cavepeoples.

Well yeah, but still. You could tell them to GOOGLE ad block, and still not say it
oh god ABC family
Oooh and ABC original movie?
*SIGH*.........ABC, REALLY!?
just simply saying it means nothing
sigh...
wat movie is this???
While I'm not personally affected by that kind of joke, I can definitely understand why it's absolutely unacceptable to make one.
/me prefers ABC than FOX
Now about this movie, How can I say so in a way of not preverting its story? Weeell, it's like Inception, only, it's Chirstmas...and not dreams.

I MISSED IT

Wrek: Yeah considering this based off a short story that's been adapted as 30 min specials (Hell Disney did this story in 18 mines) this version just pads it out
Tom V Kevin. FIGHT!

Lil_B: Too easy :P

yo
with you :D
Lol, reading script, HARDY HAR HA--Actually that was a little funny
Wait...
WAIT
wat is this movie
...Well thanks
Was he killing himself or skydiving past the boulder?
It's not like we have seen this a thousand TIMES
were...were flashbacks really necessary there?
Yeah flashbacks in a time loop movie
Why is a movie about time looping have a flashback!?
Padding is always necessary
J_E_Smith71: Trying to get past the boulder.
through much worse--- >flashback about his family
i am FLUFFY. that is all
Hey Girl!
WHAT!?
Good guy Todd...?
:P
now kiss
J_E_Smith71, I'm pretty sure he tried to skydive over the boulder
PADDING PADDING PADDING
I don't see the problem about flashback in a time film.
I think the loop should end right here.
Deadlypon3: It's not
http://imgur.com/xkJGs
Personal timelines.
aww they so cute
Deadlypon3: He needs do to something
Vordox I know...
They're not pads
Enough padding to make several fake Santas fat
I wanna play some more POKE!

Kammerjunk i like their furr, it's perfect as real ponies have
...
i wish mlp have such furr
alexxm|colt1, your main nick is kicked too.
kidzrul732: We'll live, sides we only have four eps left bet
pony_6548: Yeah, it does looks pretty good.

"...Fuck you man!'
Whoops

Deadlypon3: who are you imitating? :D just wanna know how thw joke goes
Granny is best character
No wait, that wasn't a split.
That was a lot of timeouts.
Oh damnit movie
inb4 he'll fix everything
this is a movie where you can miss half of it and still understand what happened
dark92enigma I am not immitating ayone
what it's called
I missed the first half hour :P
....
Outside the group...just..looking....tolerating...
what is this movie called?
...Just end the loop now!
:)
Deadlypon3: ''he's acting all nice, what's this BULLSHIT'' (why the comillas?, i mean)
He learned his lesson!
o nvm xD
JUST END IT NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAO
6_9
I might actually prefer the Endless Summer arc over this.
yes
DerpySenkon it's pretty pretty close to the Groundhog Day
Dark92Enigma everyone in the family!
Inception: The Holday Edition
Tovler: me too
Tovler: You mean Endless 8?
Deadlypon3: oh :) IKR?
VenHur Inception is new shit
Yes it does.
"Hahahha, It's funny cause I'm getting married and you have a small penis"
lol
really you need to watch the Groundhog Day
"Hey, your penis is small, no thanks to your horrible marriage of me!"
mmm... still have the imgur Link of wrek's unfinished picture... I don't know what kind of mustaches would fit?
<--- LAWL NO

BEN BORN EVERY DAY...FOREVER

Women screaming and dying while shouting angry stuff.
Lil_B: Fu Manchu
Wait.. she was out for it?
She cheated!
FACADE!
:O
who wants TO LIVE........FOREVER? I would, to erase this movie out of existance
The loop should really end here!
He learned his lesson!
An ABC special
I've gone through shit already :P
Even better.
*GASP* Hi LadyCanary!
Dark92Enigma: Well, that depends on what living forever entails.
ohai LadyCanary and yes :D
LadyCanary: Close, ABC Family
LOL SR
Well, could be better than freaking Cyberbully.
Dark92Enigma: Even if I assume that it comes with not aging, I'll have to deal with the fact that humanity keeps evolving, but I don't.
Or Mean Girls 2. (puke)
that Tamagotchi image from an hour ago... :P
lol
OH, GOD, THE LOOP WILL GO ON FOREVER
At least Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life was so bad it's good
What's he gonna do now....?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I think I had a TG 2
weird pirate bay doesn't have it :W
Oh
Dark92Enigma: yeah itll be streamed here on loop forever
LAWL

....
STUDY FOREEEVEEEER!
I never had one
wtf is he doing
Cyberbu//y made no sense to me
learn to break down
Breakdancing
The spaghetti. It's EVERYWHERE
inb4 he'll training and do some awesome stuff
They are awesome :P
He has all the time in the world to learn everything...
NOW, he's blowing off his family so he can improve himself.
And then the credits start
breakboning
and everyone in the city will love him
and she will love him too
O//O WTF is he doing?
LOL white people dancing.
seriously... if I had to relive the same day over and over again, but I'm aware of it, I would use the time to learn tons of stuff...
cus everybody loves him
I know
ow
Thank god we don't look at his face
Mine ran away
atleast he has his priorities straight
<-- I tried that hand stand...
IT
HURTS
i love how they cut his head out of the dancing shots
Cause the stunt actor is very shy :)
I had this http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/12/6827fe925abf58855c3322d1142b8ae2.jpg
his mad skills will break the space-time fabric and free him
Kevin Federline is my favorite white-people dancer
IF TIM BURTON WANTS BREAKDANCING IN ALICE IN WONDERLAND...........this is possible
This movie should also be named respawn.
it was awesome
Does anyone remember that digimon thing or whatever it's called?
Digimon? The show?
Noooo
It's A Wonderful Life is a lovely movie.
No it was a handheld thing
I loved both of those movies.
It was a long time ago, so I don't remember too much about it, but it was a lot of fun
Never seen it
But i'm sorry, but Home Alone 1 and 2 are the shit.
This Todd guy looks like a real cunt.
I had digimon cards in elementary school
I only watched Digimon a few times
Yo Bronies and Ponies !
VenHur: I voted for BOTH of those too
So it's down to four movies.
lol
and had no idea what was going on
LadyCanary: Welcome to ABC.
I never understood any of the tv shows that had card games and I never watched them
And I made fun of it for ripping off Pokemon
LadyCanary he proposes to his girlfriend in front of her ex-husband ^^'
LadyCanary: According to the movie, he isn't...but I don't like his eyes and face, so meh, I don't care :P
Todd should stay in the shadows
LadyCanary: IKR? but instead we have this piece of dogs***
I just got the cards because everyone else had them.
OH ANOTHER PEAS ON EARTH JOKE, right?
OH
GOD
Deadlypon3: and he saved his life
He planned THIS?!
>Pea Diddy.
Pea Diddy
BULLSHIT
why
Pea Daddy?
...
twilight_sprinkle ...So he's an idiot
OH GOD NO
Kandarihu: Oh my god...
Pea Diddy
Nice way to cover that it's a stunt dancer
Hah. 'Pea Diddy'
ad diddy's peas on earth?
Kandarihu: Dat pun hit the spot
my friend tried to get me to like it
....
:O
...... O_o
LadyCanary: same here
.........
Da shet gansta nigg'
I....I....
Deadlypon3: why? todd saved his life
....
yugioh FTW
THIS GUY. IS KING OF THE WHITE PEOPLE
it's GAAAAAAAAAAMEEBROOO
I liked Lord of the Rings because everyone else did though
This movie just cranked it up to 11
....I prefer Pig Power In The House...
LadyCanary: Dat ain't much :P
Funnily enough, you couldn't see his face.
king of da peas
It became a fad when I was in 5th grade
I never actually bought cards for any card game, I collected them because people kept giving me some.
becuase the movie came out
pea diddy...
Buytoast: But it only goes to 10!
twilight_sprinkle he's willing to save his life and yet doesn't know that proposing to his ex wife in front of him isn't hurting him!?
LadyCanary: He even out-whites VAINILLA F****** ICE?
like a boss
http://imgur.com/xkJGs really i can't handle this twilight furr
LEVEL UP!
i need her
and I didn't ever have the slightest clue on how to play the games
it was just one day the day so has he truly still saved his life
I just had the cards.
the day reset*
VenHur: All classics, though the hour specials probably weren't long enough to vote for
Arthur won....what?
Well that wasnt predictable enough.
ohey Vordox
I have no idea how to play the pokemon TCG either
Lil_B: Hai
Goodness me, or should he say goodness pea
Deadlypon3: he didnt realize it would hurt him, after he saved his life he said he wouldnt propose to her because it hurts him
i need the lord of the rings tune
WOW, SO PREDICTABLE
but I have tons of cards
OH GOD
ahaha
I have a bunch of yugioh cards. I have no clue where they came from though :P
ANGRY STARE JESUS
jesus confirmed for evil
my mom got rid of all mine
J_E_Smith71: OH MY GOD, Who, the hell, cares?
As Tim Allen once said. Never give up; Never surrender
peas
But I found a bunch of them at a thrift store for a dollar
Todd: he was there, too
and had to buy them
twilight_sprinkle ...Why are you so defensive? Your right, but still
alexxm|colt, The Hendersons were the evil who were defeated.
Hmm
LOL oh great
but she didn't take them away.
I remember when that was going around
J_E_Smith71: EVEN JACK FROST is more entertaining.....or SANTA MUSCLES. it's cheesy but it has THE HULKSTER
lol
Vordox the Tail Movement is getting smoother, but It#S still a bit erm... you see like 2 phases
Granny on fire. :P
Lil_B: Let me see. :)
VenHur: Who cares they are too short to vote for?
Yeah, take the kid to the pub.
Deadlypon3: im not defensive, i just dont like it when people rush to claim something without properly thinking it over
That's a child-friendly habitat.
....Easy Bake oven ;^;
he cried when he saw it
My mom also didn't let us drink Cherry or Vanilla Coke because the terrorists were poisoning it.
And his parents had to comfort him and say it wasn't evil
:S
:D
Oh my gosh the chat server hates me sometimes
Yep. That is one fine looking Bar-be-que pit...
wut
Oh, excuse me. FUN BAKE OVEN.
that's a new one
But normal coke is fine.
hahaha
My mom is awesome and funny.
It's black now
:D
We have some good arguments all the time.
DED
J_E_Smith71: It does not matter about the length, they're classics in any forms of length.
XD
more like bun make loven?
my mom hates arguments
DED
eas bake my plot
WHAT?
This guy. Is also the Duke of Spaghetti.
easy
I don't get this
lol
when I used to contradict her as a teenager she'd just run away and go "I don't want to talk about this anymore"
HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THIS IN ONLY A HALF HOUR
We can argue without taking it personally and holding a grudge just because one of us was wrong.
Without anyone noticing?!
A real EasyBake oven was a metal box inside a plastic box with a lightbulb. And they WORKED.
to be fair I was pretty pushy
Deadlypon3: Guess he praticed on the loops
So I don't entirely blame her
Deadlypon3: He probably didn't, he probably did it over weeks.
Deadlypon3: because.......this movie sucks?
Kencolt: My little cousin got one for Hanukah. And I concur.
science!
lolercopter
I like to think we are reasonable people.
So he just made him a Creepy Crawler oven
How many days have Kevin been time looping? 4 years?
J_e_smith71 even then, where did he get the material so quickly?! And how did he carry it over in loops?!
He should use this loops to learn how to draw
jus-jus-just another day
I want a monster melt
^
^^
IS IT OVER YET?
I dont know.
No
< and now everyone will love him
You're very reasonable
^^^^^^^^^^^
I think we can all agree
TORNADO
Ded :D
Wasn't there a toy commercial for some kind of toy oven that made gooey monster candy?
Actual kid
TORNADO POWER
nononononno
Deadlypon3: PLOT HOLE, same place where the TNT I guess
-_(\
phew
DR. DREDFUL!
And ya overdo it
D:
My great grandpa who passed away a few years ago was the king of debating and arguing.
ew
J_e_smith71 got it from Coyote
MY REACTION TO THIS FILM <-----------
The Monster Melt right on the rug
DED
...Now I feel sorry for Todd
He was blind, and had one arm, but that didn't stop him.
SPLAT
why isnt he singing
so jazzy :)
Yeah, Todd kinda gets shafted in this movie
...And todd never appears again
yeah tood whata buzzkill
What a tank
He would fish around for something you and him disagreed with and just start a debate.
ready for smooth jazz?
/me yawns.
I'm just glad Todd isn't a stereotypical jackass.
SOMEONE DROP AN ANVIL ON TODD
This woman's voice.
out of nowhere. it doesnt matter who you were or where you were.
kammerjunk Instead, he's a incomplete jackass
SO HIS SUFFERING CAN END :'(
99 buckets of fuking ouats
ANOTHER SONG?
Dark92Enigma: Give Todd a cahance. :P
kammerjunk who doesn't get anything he wants even thought he is justifiablly nice to the family
MAGIC
oats*
not bad
Oh god original song time
DAMNIT
NO BASS!!!!! NOOOOO
white people everyone
nah its pretty bad
Then he would pull out his book and give you a copy and tell you to read it.
Kammerjunk, in another timeline, he proposed to a woman IN FRONT OF HER EX-HUSBAND.
The title was something about dirty liberals.
and he was studing how to sing for dummies
Kandarihu: he didnt realize it would hurt him
Satan pony xD
not even auto tune can help
Random orchestra
it only took a hundre retries
Kandarihu: after his "suicide attempt" he said he wont propose if it hurts hinm
hundred
Vordox: on second thought.........i'll spare him :( only because i regret it
AUTO TUNE EVER HELPS!
.......
He's a changed diaper… I mean man

Deadlypon3: no but it didnt look like he wanted to hurt him at all, plus he didnt even know him before this

Kandarihu And Todd is never mentioned again
Did he propose?
Buttsecks
Did he not?

Dark92Enigma: Hardly, I'm studying Narrative within Game Design, which isn't far from the actual Movie Script Design of Narrative
You people and your wishes!

J_E_SMITH71 Veeeeeeery carefully
My parents bought me the console and rented the games for me
What about the camping?

Sandvich well that is REALLY important
Vordox: i dont know what meta of monomyth is.
YES IT IS!
GOOD GOD, STOP ROLLING THE FUCKING CREDITS ALREADY.

Curses, foiled again!
Dark92Enigma: I can make a better movie than that piece 'o shit.
I feel sorry for poor Rainbow DAsh
WMC?
Worst movie clause
Worst Movie Clause
Dark92Enigma: It called "The UGLY Barnacle".
I didn't know that Ponyviille has so many inhabiutants
I'm watching this at work :3
I know a bit about cars, not a hobby of mine or anything, but my dad likes cars.
Aaaahh
Just cut the line -_- I do it all the time.
VenHur: OH, THAT ONE WILL WIN THE OSCAR
/me stands infront of Sandvish, looking angrily and very bruteish
Try
FRIEEEEEEEEEEEEENDS
If I ever need something to do with cars I just ask a guy
U mad :P
Sandvich: you get a death sentence for that in equestria
I'm let people in front of me :P
just dont ask me.
I
Lawl I saw Twi and Rarity
Dark92Enigma: Once, there was an UGLY barnacle, he was SO ugly that everyone died! ...The end.
sounds kind of sexist but they almost always know more than me
ONE MONTH, btw
The music from the Mario Kart 64 game was real awesome
I probably fit that bad driver stereotype perfectly
Thanks to one YouTube Poop I saw which I can't find anymore, everytime Applejack sings "faithful and strong" in the opening, I hear "faithful es shnivel" instead.
When I was in school I would just walk past all the people and get my food :P
http://imgur.com/XadSx aww perfect
:(
Venhur: ...That didn't help at all :(
xD
VenHur: such a beautiful and tearjerking story at the same time :'(
I would so buy a few mugs just for Rainbow Dash.

WAIT SHE DIDINT GET HER MONEY BACK
Fluttershy doesn't mind because she already got some
Fluttershy don't mind if RD takes her
was pretty loyal of RD to bring along fluttershy and even let her go first
<---- OH SHIT; open Apple Orchard Support line, CALL it!
I feel so bad for Rainbow Dash. I would so buy Rainbow Dash like FIVE mugs ahead.
That might be a possability

or not
thank you big mac
NO DEAL.

How are they supposed to make cider without any apples?
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUN we're the bad guys

Rainbow Dash should get a free cup of cider.
DAMNIT
POOR RAINBOW! :'(
Watching these episodes, with spike the way he is, makes me wonder where his retard mode came from suddenly.
SUE THEM FOr home destroying
To be fair only a handful of ponies make the Cider
Bipolarized: synthetized apple juice
You know what? FFB have no right to expect 75% of the profits from the cider. The Apple family worked very hard to grow those apples. And they even use the apples for other purposes.

Ya damn drunk farmers
Oh shush Flim FLam...

its all the cider.

"Good thing that i'm a dragon"

They're in 3D, how terryfying:O
[Alpha]: she'll explain
Where is Fluttershy!?

but here is he's just useless
...Well thats kind of morbid.
Same runing animation as always
My Pets Q.Q
Azuredragon: a zoid named TimberWolf...i could see this lol
lol made of wood
they didn't die
twilight_sprinkle spike was in 3d for a few second there too
"Mama?"
I love you Apple jack. Have my babys
BUUUURN!
all i need to take on a timber wolf is a few roman candles XD
Barbetos: damn, i missed that
an axe
HAAAAAAAAAAM
OK, here's my issue with this episode: Spike has been saved SEVERAL TIMES. By Twilight, by Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy AND NOW APPLEJACK!
Oh...
okay then
twilight_sprinkle it looked like it anyways
are we watching the new Ep?
Everto
They are okay :D
Just send pyro into the forest. He'll fix things.
Let's just left their carcasses there...
i'll explain later
Forget the axe back to the flames
Lil_B: Yep
Terminator ref ?
maybe some one just draws really good
t1000
Did you temporarily turn into a kid from xbox live yesterday?
wonder how many bits it costs to rent that hot air ballon
maybe it didn't count when they were in a group
Wow...
Spike is a slave
REALLY
... I hateed... I... erm really really REALLY diflike this episode
DED
Who, me?
because she also saved herself those times
dislike*
No, Everto
Lil_B: same here.
Pigington
thats a big pig
Vordox, secs... slave
Whatin the....
Awwwww piggy :3
Here comes Honey Boo Boo
yea, not fond of this one
Is Spike always this clumsy? maybe he got into a little something he shouldn't have.
*Little* Piggenton?
piggenton sparkle
SEXY!!!
Later guys
Lil_B: THIS is the 1st ep TO IGNITE MY RAGE
What a cute piggy!
Don't worry, FiW has shown us that he's used to it
bai Ponies47
Spike is the biggest clutz in this ep.
Tie: That's the thing I'm confused about...Spike is an awesome sl...buttl.... Err "friend"
Eva Pigford
bye Ponies47
later Ponies47 ^_^
Vordox Well if we wanted to look at this from the intended message he is young, really loves his work, or is just really that thick when he is allowed to think for himself
Bye Ponies47 ^_^
He is good at thinking for others.
Spike is the new Derpy
nonesense plot, nosthjing for kids really to learn, and generaslly awkward to just watch it, this ep was awful :/
Bai Ponies47
Water skiing...over sharks
Barbetos: That's the thing.
BUUUUUUUUURN
Spike has issues.
Spike: I JUST CLEANED THAT PIG!
:D
Barbetos: Spike has issues
PIES.
PIES!
I think it's a dragon thing.
Dat pie
X'D
PIE!
Bipolarized: that's the point. he's done some amazing things, and now he's all clumsy
< gaben
Lawl even Granny
NUM
o-o
I mean, wasn't he saved before by RD and Fluttershy?
:D
goddamn, what the hell is going on
DAT GILLIGAN CUT.....i feel so old
Lawl Granny...regret that
WAIT.......PONIES EAT EGGS!????
Spike is notmally a much betgter cook...
How did he manage to do that?
When he was falling to his death with Rarity?
Spike has been an able servant forever....
SirGanjalf: Everypony has saved spike
:D
Why trouble now?
best servant ever
Ponies eat chickens
beware scootaloo
xD
pinkie eats hotdogs
Dark92Enigma: Guess it must be for baking purposes
spike is serioously out of his element
Vordox: Exactly. Is he a slave to Twilight or like a brother/son.
scootaloo NUUUUUUUUUUUUU
They've always eaten eggs. Eggs are in many baked goods as well.
.mov spike
Wait... CHIKEN LAY EGGS? Jk
Makes you wonder how he didn't drop the crystal heart.
Im not gona fail again.
Tie: I think Spike...either lied about being an assistant...
how did he even find out about the code
twilight_sprinkle: He reminds me of me :P
Man, he would set a whole library on fire
The code you just made up
BUUUUUUURN
Tie: And twi doing all the tough stuff.
thats the second time in this season he looked like the mov spike
BroPony|MEDIC: Then why he suddenly has an urge to AJ's doormat?
*be
i mean he didn't know anything about dragons before
... his behaviour is so unimaginably irrationalll... I mean... this is beyond suspension of disbelieve
I'LL TASTE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
/me slaps thelonecubone|GoW3 around a bit with a large cow
Vordox: Or he's spy!
:o
SirGanjalf: It wasnt a good idea for an episode until now
LAWL TWI
Does anyone here find me sexy?
Changling spike
i just wanna make a note of how granny smith seems ALOT less...odd since the reunion.
I only honor Konami Code
i think it all makes sense if there was a way for him to know about the dragon code
I will go with that.
How does that book stay up?
lol
twi gives 0 fucks
twi: i don't care of you little annoying dragon
mhmm
i cant focus like that
/me slaps twilight_sprinkle around with a large chancla :3
:D
Twilight is too busy reading to hear Spike.
0 fucks given
:):Silly Spike, slaves can't decide who is their master...
Spike is a changling :D
"Twilight I'm going to commit a mass murder spree." "Mmm-hmmm, that's fine Spike."
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/259/943/694.png
Every body Haaaate Spike!
dammit spike
....Oh dear.
FOREVER
foooreeever
he did a mess that fast?
FOREVER
:O
made
wow twilight was on full autopilot
I know you do.
... well done Writers... "Why does Twilight not Stop Spike?" , "Well... she's reading and ignored what he said, and nobody questions it..." GENIOUS
Tie, Twilight Sparkle personally hatched him from an egg. Even though he's officially her assistant, Twilight Sparkle has more of a mother role to Spike.
no spike
go back to twi
End of story
YOU NEVER WAS NOBLE.
< aj so adorable
Kandarihu: So we're seeing Spike for what he really is for once? :P
and plotty
I wish. . .Spike would stay with Twilight.
yes!
Lawl AJ. :P
Nice Ax.
My issue with this ep: Spike has been already saved by :) :( :D and now >_>. WHY SPIKE DIDN'T CALLED FOR THE CODE EARLIER!???? Is this how he got to assist Twi? I'm sorry, this seems rushed and made-up
Whitewash the fence
Spike, you cheating whorse:|
THIS WILL END WELL
:S
here comes the glitches
/me must calm himself.... first thiongs first, mute it
this part
Well that looks delicious.
I love it
Shat pie.
We ALL remember when Spike did food last time...
I agree with Afflict
At least it isn't Sweetie's Orange Juice.
Spike painting a fence
rarity, i am dissappoint
Ash Pie, my favourite>_>
Dude...
Spike must have taken cooking lessons from Sweetie Belle
Too creep
See the pube on the side of it?
Vordox, the real Spike is what we've seen all episode. He was with Twilight all his life.
creepy....
EAT IT
in this upcoming bit that is
it tastes like shit!
RARITY IS A BLANK FLANK LOOK!!!
Er, all series.
no really it's shit
eat it bitch it it good
Isn't Spike usually a much better cook?
eat your peas rarity!
DUH HUH HUH, callback to Spike X Rarity
No I don't
...except for Secret of my Excess.
I'm not into 14 year olds
Hey Everyone! :)
I think I would have preffered Sweetie Belle's Burned jiuce
Where did spike go anyways?
Kandarihu: Yesh but this is beyond his character.. too far even.
now i am dissappoint
there see she has a blank flank
that would be way creepy
inb4 slave
Lightning_Wing: dude, there were full grown blank flanks at the apple family reunion
Aren't they in the kitchen, with the sink?
also i thought was good cooking
lol
clearly Twi has enchanted him to make him useless when not in her presence
Rarity you don't need a debt to get Spike to do that.
Kencolt the inconsistency in this episode is F*¨**** KILLING ME
Plus your engaged.
I am loving Pokemon right now.
05DAT NOVEL

Bipolarized ikr? it's never needed, not when you're talking about Rarity
There needs to be a fic of Dashie's novel.
The NRA is blaming shootings on VGs

hi TOM
Really, you cant start your sentence with a symbol
rd needs medical help
Wow..:Spike...
Spike is useless
You need to grow up
spike pulled a pinkie pie
it's just a place where a bunch of teenagers post pictures
spike not useless only with twi
Spike is your servant for life. make him do useless stuf
just shut up?
Dark92Enigma: That or it's her auto biography
Well, if anything can be said about Spike, he has been spending a lot of time around Twilight. He has her OCD too.
SPIKE THINKING TOO MUCH
ues
and talk about how they are the scum of the earth
yes
You don't know how to help yourself! Lawl.
:O
yesy
yes
oh :)
AJ x Spke

Remix it!
Oh my~

Aj
SpikeXAJ
LAWL
xD
whered he get that!
wtf
Indeed he does, Wreky.
I'm loving this episode. I wish the ponies interacted at least like this in the season premiere.
Unmoderated....
Spike NO!
LAWLZZZZ
Such a bad generation.
Hr pulled a pinkie pie
what in the hell is this
Some of us like me dont look @porn
LOL XD
No her favorite song is Racist Barn
AJ is not Pinkie, she could die!
:D
Dat OCD
OCD
OCD ACTIVATE
LOL
OCD much Twilight?
XD
This is the cartooniest episode ever, and I approve.
o.o
what?!
If you touch that ink jar agin I will end you.
WAT
oh i can imagine tonn of sweet sweet art of spikexAJ now
O,o
Twilight what are you doin
Kencolt: I got to agree on that, but it's taking a huge "Step" of change. :P
derpiboo.ru/196845
that's good
:D
Thats one flimsy excuse for a Plotpoint
I've never seen porn
don't plan to
That communication failure between Spike and Twilight Sparkle is stuff I've seen on both sides.
Maybe we could talk about it... nah, lets take the long way around and trick them into learning their lesson
I think thats a lie. You have been on the internet too long not to see anything.
Alchemist: lol
realy?...counting grass?
Now I have a picture of Spike riding Applejack into the sunset stuck in my mind
Alchemist: for some reason that makes me laugh :D
counting each blade of grass
I Moustache you a question.
okay I've never _watched_ it
Well...Pinkie has a good idea
No
Moustache!
dat stache
:D
oh
I've come across pictures of course
Oh Pinkie
not the hornets!
Dat srs face AJ
You have never purposely looked for it.
But not intentionally
:3)
yeah
And anyone could wander in and take stuff from Twilight. "You mind if I take all your bits Twilight?" "Mmmm-hmmm."
Everyone has never not seen it
It always pops up
Pinkie's plan's more fun
Especially Piratebay
OK, I think I can believe that.
Yes Pinkie, you can wear da stashe
Dem drawlings
*stache
Porn is not thepiratebay
pnikies plan would probably work too
It must be a dragon thing in the equestrian world. Kind of like second nature. Dragons have a code or something in this case, course Spike does not know the proper code, cause he was never raised by dragons.
It's-a-me-a-Pinkie pie! :D
better than this shit
J_E_Smith71: or, Twi would you go out with me? ''hmm-mm''
No
thats just russian dating ads.
aww
Applejack is an expert artist
:D
prelude derpiboo.ru/80221
Best question
rarity acting lessons
Pinkie, not even your funny jokes save this episode
with stuff equal to about victoria's secret models.
oh
what?
Hmm, more animation to Twilight Sparkle's teleport, now. It's like her horn stays in place a split second longer than the rest of her body now.
Its not that bad. It just gives a massive head ache
Rarity <3
Cuase it makes you think to damn much
Everyonce in a while, you get porn on PB
Alchemist I DON'T GET IT DU'J
Filler episode?
mmmm ham
RARITY the drama queen
https://derpibooru.org/197027?scope=scpef836b6c7cf7e7f375439ea5519e5a0a61a437ee7

ikr aj
DUDE SPIKE
wow.... I hope the stream is off soon, theres a non picture Link I have to show you
You can download it, but those ads are not porn.
jesus
Clumsy, but damn persistent
:o
Fluttershy has nice shoes. I want dem shoes.

TIMBERWOLF!
HOW DID DASH DO THAT!
Lawl Rarity....

That'll show up in trivia contests "How many blades of grass are at Sweet Apple Acres?"
Uh oh.
Applejack... Element of Honesty.
RD must've been taking lessons from Bon Bon
>_>
she deserves an oscar
a puppet? Can't Twilight just control the thing directly with er magic?
I see what you did there
spike is dissapointed in your childsplay
>_><_<
a fake?!:O
A FAKE!
lucky
or whatever they give for great acting
Lawl RD
How did you know?!
first time he had his back right up against a timberwolf he didnt sense the smell

Ooookay, the Timber Wolf is awesome.
DED
OUT OF WOOD
Lawl Spike...
Good ...
WHAT THE F*CK!?
BURN IT WITH FIRE
05the reason behidn it is probably the advanced animation they had them do (runnign wise) early on
AJ putting on panty hose pose?
Lame death is lame.
choke it to death
One day ill go to hawaii with one of my copters, and set up a live video feed from the copter to the internet and fly around

05the biggest paiun ever
Azuredragon in all those instances she HAD to face them to solve a problem. She is not dumb, knowing when to run or fight is important too.

and thus, the new lamest endboss ever

And the Timberwolves end up being easiest to kill villian in the show
Eat a rock Explode
gotta say, that 3d animation made em look too out of place and awkward
At the very least they could have used dragon fire!
Rock beats paper
Still though, really bad call on her part. She left spike and aj behind.

That would've been perfect!
DerpyMuffins: lol
05the big one at the end was still flash though
Foreign contanimation is the Timber Wolf's weakness... simple brute force works well too.
Cool

The episode wasnt too bad, actually.

Kencolt: Rough Act 1, better Act 2, but Act 3 was hilarious

08,01penguin: birthday hug anyway?
either my brother or my sister, can't remember which, left gum in their pocket once
And she's like, "I put it in the washermachine"
and the gum got all over everyone's clothes
And I'm like, "Why!? I do my own laundry."
Wrek: Better yet make it the Beatles birthday. "Ya say it's your birthday, well it's my birthday too yeah..."
And she's like, "It was piling up in your room"
hey everyone, I was just browsing through Kickstarter when I found this "Collectable Pony 'Stained Glass' Coin II" http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1982918646/collectable-pony-stained-glass-coin-ii?ref=category

Funky music
And she's like, "We can still save water."

Scary but funky. :)
And I'm like, "Don't touch my clothes"
and she's like, "Why not?"
hahahaha this song is so creepy:)
Buytoast not really, it's a nice Idea, it lies within yourself to judge where your money go, and they do their best to find Liars
And I'm like, "Because whenever you bring them back up you give my my father's pants"
so jolly
kickstarter is awesome. I can't wait for the Ouya *explodes in laughter*
And she's like, "Sorry, I get them confused a lot"
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAm
shit i was wondering where the music came from
forgot i had this up
:W
And I'm like, "He's at least 200 pounds, I'm half that"
Whats this songs nam, anyone knows?

Tovler: ...
And she's like, "Don't make fun of your father, he has high blood pressure"
maybe i should not open 50 tabs

.
Wrek: may I post a link about Ouya?
So I'm just sitting there, and my phone is all washed, and I'm sad
Ouya is garbage
One day my mom was all like, would you like a grilled cheese sandwich?
It was posted about 7 hours ago
and I was like, that would be awesome
hay is there anywhere I can suggest a movie for next friday?
then she said, "then get off your computer and go make one."
care bears
Tropic Thunder
haha,
Wrek: whats this song called?
"Grilled cheese."
"What?"
"Grill me a cheese."
Ballets - Tungg i think
Buytoast yes, and I did not pledge to OUYA because I think it will fail... again, they just offer the chance, its your choice to pledge or not
Wrek: May I post a link about Ouya?
"I'm not grilling you a cheese."
"*Crying*"
ballets
k
"Fine, I'll grill you a cheese."
doesn't change teh fact kickstarter is bad
that kick message
Youre mostly welcome....>_>
this is a really nice song... who is this?
I think Wrek fell asleep?
I will never understand
No.
Tovler: Oy you
Wrek just kicked some one.
and banned
Did he?
Yeah
although I do like this one kickstarter project here.
Who got kicked?
08,01it's AMAZING
Rainbowdashh2

Dont let him get to you, sweetie.

/me hugs Wreky ^_^
:[
08,01Wrek: from what?
Tovler: Ouya has partnered with some big names in gaming, such as on-demand gaming service OnLive, which will bring to the platform hundreds of games from more than 80 publishers as well as Square Enix, which will offer Final Fantasy III as a launch title.
:P
was that the guy from last night Wrek?

Wrek sweetie it's looking wonderful!!!
Naaaah

Totally.

That looks AWESOME Wrek! :) I just love all that amount of detail what you have put into that Cello. ;)
chat derped on me
Wrek: For goodness sake. become an art director for Flash already. :P
but it will be funny when all these people realize that the Ouya won't be able to play their newer stuff
she has wings and she will flutter them
Buytoast: Play the newer stuff...?
Vordox not flash. HTML5 is the future!
Ooh, Simon & Garfunkel?
Flash is poopy
well Wrek you got your self a keeper you lucky sonofabitch. yes i is jelly what of it
always has been and will be.
Buytoast: With support for up to four controllers, its hardware includes a Tegra 3 quad-core processor, 1 GB RAM, 8GB onboard flash storage, HDMI out with up to 1080p support, 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE 4.0, one USB 2.0 port, Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), and an Ethernet port.
The name of the song anyyone?
I wish i could make a perfect circle O.O
There's ONE thing here that looks...crap...>>
1 Gigabyte Ram? XD
The things I have pledget on Kickstarter have been, Turrican Soundtrack Anthology, The Pink Album, Descendants of Erdrick Album #2 and Project Giana, they all have paid off so far :)
It's something by Simon & Garfunkel.
four controllers and 1 GB RAM
Rainbow: The Boxer.
wow
lel Wrek
so advanced
Buytoast: Yeah. I got to agree on that part...
I hope their audience is willing to pay more than $10 for a game.
you can't make a perfect circle by hand
Thank you Kencolt ! :)
it's impossibru
Wrek, got any other S&G songs?
Tovler: Actually...
exists a satan pony because i doesn't want that my Created pony called as a Satan pony ? xD
Satan pony -_-
doesn't matter in the end because people will still eat it up
yeah... they got so m,uch over their innitial Pledge Goal and still couldn't offer 2 GB RAM... that was... bad
if everyone is eating shit for dinner, you look the odd one out if you dont want to eat shit
it's as simple as that
PONY WANTS HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
Calm.
I forgot about that Ouya detail.
Night everypony

Is it time to get my groove on?
Buytoast: XD
Funky... Like Scarman or something Wrek? :)
I spy Deus eX.

Scatman*
Me thinks Infected Mushrom.
The walking dead has 5 parts
not the one person
Yep, Infected Mushroom.
Oh hey, I know this song.
/me gets funky
but one of them
dat is not funk
I like Infected Mushroom.
/me tries to search for good kickstarter fundraisers.
besides, anybody can call anything shit
so eh
Lets get this party started. :D
1200 DEVELOPER versions...
No, Wrek. We need smooth jazz. Nao.
That's a pretty good number.
ok theres the funk
it'll still crash and burn
We need Yourenigma :3
did i miss the new episode livestream?
oh, so there is no reasonable stream for now, i'll get the fuck out
yup
Song Wrek? Please! :(
Name of it i mean.
Sandvich why you saying satan pony xD

Buytoast: You do know about a small gravel can make a landslide, right? :P Give stuff time.
Jesus...

Rainbow: I Wish by Infected Mushroom
IIRC

i feel like i have heard this before
I like this :)
I Wish- Infected Mushroom
Kammerjunk youre my savior! :)
oh thanks Kammerjunk and LadyCanary ^_^
if it wasn't promoted as something that would rival the PS3 in graphical capabilities maybe i would
LadyCanary: How do you know every single Wrek song...?
but when they're saying stuff like that when it aint true
Buytoast: ...But the fourth gen is about to start
then i hope it fails
IT JUST LOOKS SATANIC
good evening/morning everyone
ohai ekips
and?
Ohai ekips
Oh hi, ekips.
Ohai ekips :)
Buytoast: Gen 3 vs Gen 4...
it wouldn't be anywhere near what the PS3 would look like
Either Wrek and I listen to the same music, or I use Shazam, Vordox.
Hi ekips :)
but they keep saying it'll be like that
LadyCanary: Shazam it is
it's just flat out lying to get sales
it doesn't lock satanic D:
HI ekips
Buytoast: You do know Microsoft started on a lie right? :P
so much to read >.>
i just wonder if we got all of Evil dead movies here?
It's both Vordox XD Though I cant say I've listened to much Infected Mushroom.
sometime
Wither: why would it?
Let me see the link again
Well, if it wins then probably.
Think I'm gonna get my ass kicked in an online shooter before turning in. Night, everybrony!
o :3 it's drawing w/ wrek time yey~
unfortunatly, only one other person came :/
Buytoast: ....What?
maybe use alternate descriptions
hello ekips :)
Buytoast: Did you just say that.... And being honest?
Who wants a Flugel Horn?
http://s1.directupload.net/images/121229/slrdetgf.png
That is some intense detail in the cello Wrek ^_^
Vordox: what did microsoft say

LOVE IT WREK! <3 Youre SO talented. :3

05<RainbowDashhh3> I'd like to see things from your point of view, but I can't get my head that far up my ass, wreky boy.
Well first off...
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch: Shirts, Cards, Books, and More!
Vordox: but what was the lie
BladedWings, Its mine! no.
He needed money, he lied, he got money, he started something.
:D
The exact lie twilight_sprinkle ?
Tie: but you asked :(
twilight_sprinkle: "I have a product" <-- He had nothing
BladedWings: I LIED!
they aren't just lying about the product though
wow Wreky
Did he really say that to you Wrek?
they're lying about what it will do
What a fucking dick, Wrek.
Buytoast: He was, he didn't even have DOS then
It has red eyes, Satanic wings, weird ass hord things where its ears should be.
Vordox: maybe he meant he had a theory for a product
The boy probably needed to make his small dick feel bigger on the internet.
Yea. :D
Lol
It happens. Also, dis guitar.
twilight_sprinkle: No...he had nothing
it's like saying, here, you give me money and i'll make a car if you give me money
and then i build a go cart
twilight_sprinkle: He bought DOS from the real developer for about 20k Grand.
:T
and tell you its a car
twilight_sprinkle: That he had no connection to at all beforehand
it has wheels and a streeing wheel, so it must be a car
0,5<LadyCanary> The boy probably needed to make his small dick feel bigger on the internet.
0,5LEL
^^"
I would love to hang out far more but then again its really late around here.... Oh well, im up all night then i guess. :D
twilight_sprinkle: Good luck finding source about this. :P I can't even find it anymore, seems it got deleted.
Vordox: im not familiar with the exact quote,but if he said "i have a product" maybe he meant idea for a product
Rainbow: you never sleep if you come here lol
05aaaaw
05the IRCops got to him
Bladed Wings thts so true! :D
05and i jsut came up with my response :C
twilight_sprinkle: No, he had nothing at all, no base, no nothing, he just said he had a product, without having anything to show at all.
05"I'd make one up but it would be a waste of time, seeing as you are dead determined to try and aggrovate me."
no sleep >.>
0,14I'm bouncing out for now, peace and enjoy the stream
Bye Saxy!
Bye SaxyPretender
Bye SaxyPretender :)
bye SaxyPretender
twilight_sprinkle: DOS was made by another person who he bought from to just show something after the deal was done.
Bye SaxyPretender :)
i am searching me like hell to find out if i missed the new episode livestream or not... idk what time 10:30 am EST is here...
hm, I should prolly tell my uncle about Kickstarter.
You did.
ok...
Catalan_brony: you missed it sowwy
But, you can try YouTube to find the episode.
^
It's probably up.
Vordox: ok, maybe ill look that up
Wrek, you really need to share your playlist whit me also! You have just AMAZING Music taste! Whats the name of this again? ;)
twilight_sprinkle: Good luck finding it, I'm trying to but haven't found it yet. Searching deeper
finally, I don't know what just happened
Vordox searching what?
a Question ! is derpy rainbow dashs sister?
-_-
Lil_B: Searching for the truth of the lie, I remember it clearly, but I don't know from where.
Wither: no
:O
Vordox which lie? I only followed half of your discussion
Wither: LOLWUT, odd thing to get pinged to
Lil_B: Microsoft started on a lie
0,5DIE
yes it is
and why love celestia bananas
as apple, they just bought ideas
or taking that
Why are gold and diamonds worth so much?
Not just in one culture, but in all of them
So what else is going on tonight?
Cuz they're rare
Wrek be drawing ^_^
I see what you mean though
And playing the most amazing music
And diamonds and gold are not that rare
agreed
Diamonds are actually incredibly common
high quality ones aren't
they usually have "inclusions" in them and aren't very shiny
Just really wish i coul also get my hands on his playlist. I really dont know any of these songs.
and are small
twilight_sprinkle: MS-DOS was a renamed form of 86-DOS – informally known as the Quick-and-Dirty Operating System or Q-DOS[5] – owned by Seattle Computer Products, written by Tim Paterson.[5] Microsoft needed an operating system for the then-new Intel 8086 but it had none available, so it bought 86-DOS for $75,000 and licensed it as its own then released a version of it as MS-DOS 1.0
75k O.o
sudden text
DAMN that's alot
Too mch for me 6_9
That's the best part of what I could find
Rainbow, most of these are from Infected Mushroom
Even still, they aren't rare enough to have thousands of dollars applied to them
ITS A PARAGRAPH RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!
/me puts on horny helmet
to much text X.X
Ah i see. thanks. :) Helps alot!
=_______=
Gem cutters can make most diamonds look flawless
twilight_sprinkle: best I could find,,, from Wiki, but it's not the full truth, hmm
Rainbow, this one in particular is called "Bust a Move"
DAMNIT... I just saw that I actually forgot to pledge to The Pink Album to Kickstarter >.< now it's over :/
if you post this on reddit, you'd probably get a huge circlejerk about the evils of the diamond industry
And gold is useful in so many things, but they're expensive in jewelry
so we'll just go with that
I guess
AdamTheDuck i keep that in mind. :)
Vordox: why did they need to do this? were they trying to show an example for some cocmpany to fund them?
I'm reading about keyboards
twilight_sprinkle: Bill Gates tried to get IBM sponsorship
Wait... did I miss the movie stream?
Yep.
There's one that uses tiny gold plating switches so that they never corrode
Vordox: hm ok
Crap...
Aye, and so did i if that help a bit.
Gold can be pressed down extremely thin. Thinner than aluminum
twilight_sprinkle: So he got funded on only claim that he had a product, but he hadn't any :P
It doesn't corrode, and it is more conductive than even copper
so is this a speedpaint or livestream?
Well, at least there's an awesome chat room.
Wooooah!! Whats the name of this song??
:O
Yet we seem to put it in jewelry for some reason
RaveBrony, Bust a Move - Infected Mushroom
Bust a Move id it havent been chnging, its really hard to tell. :D
AdamTheDuck: Mmmm, thanks :)
Dis song <3
Vordox: did he use that os he bought or was windows still originally created?
We need smooth jazz. I want to just slide out of my chair!
gold is delicate
twilight_sprinkle: Windows was not created back then
Vordox: i know, but i mean after that
Tie, word of warning, never tell Wrek what music to play.
It's malleable and ductile, but not delicate as in breakable
looking at my engagement ring right now, it has tons of scratches and stuff in it
twilight_sprinkle: And yes, MSDOS was the main computer system back then in the 1970-80s
O.o
Yea
when I first got it one of the diamonds fell out right away
0,5Hm, where did you send it?
AdamTheDuck Okie Dokie Lokie
So why not use something that will keep it's beauty?
and they had to put more gold around them to keep them in
where is octavias pupill?
Vordox: i mean did microsoft use the os he bought or was it built from scatch
bronystateuploads
twilight_sprinkle: Nah, he used the OS.
If you mess whit a Brony, make sure you have some sort of escape plan, and a damn good one i mean!
they used it
twilight_sprinkle: They needed it for the ...er..8080 I think?
it can easily be fixed if I take it to a jewler to buff it
Intel 8080 or something.
/me resists the urge to brag about his music tastes
i saw great movie about whole story
Something that doesn't scratch easily
Vordox: hm ok, interesting, thx
pony_6548: A movie?
jewelry is not supposed to be treated roughly
yeh it was
Which one pony_6548 ?
about apple and microsoft
I guess that's why
Something that would better suit jewelry, and use gold for something that it's better suited for
Whats the name of this one then!? Yes, i a annyin a bit i know. But cant help it! :)
let me see
twilight_sprinkle: A movie that may tell it. :D Might also work as reference, if no liberties was taken
pirates of silicon valley i thought
reminds me of the Gabe Newell Video... "He also worked on MSWindows Versions for DOS" in the Background we see ... Windows 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2
pony_6548: Gonna take a look at that.
Vordox: well i hope its trustworthy sources
What the crap is this?
Dat octi
If you print the entire Bible onto gold leaf
klarinetist livepaint
It would measure the size of a single peice of paper
i think...
Story about microsoft and apple pretty artistic but also pretty true
That's a papercut waiting to happen
Scatman?
What about Him LadyCanary?

twilight_sprinkle: One reviewer: While the movie is long, it would have been even better as a two-day or three-day miniseries. That would have enabled some of the historical record to be explored at greater depth, eliminating the need for this deliberate vast oversimplification.
Welp, some electroswing
<3
/me dances
Zip zop zoobeldy bop.
Vordox: hm, interesting where the reviewer read the "true" story

ok....
This silent, I can not stand it (\(O,......,O)/)

Silence will fall when the question is asked.
...And then butler got bored of the chat and everypony died. THE END.

...But little did young butler know, there was evil lurking in the bowels of the chat room that would soon try and corrupt his heart.
Come to the dark side butler

No butler, why did you join the Dark Side? I have to destroy you now. You were like a son to me.

thelonecubone|GoW3: Tickers?

BladedWings, little things that run at you and explode :P
the little Exploding ...^
boom!
But they're so cute ^w^
yea, called Tickers lol
I guess I like Changeling design, but what I love most about Changelings is thinking about them and how they and their society would work.
weeping_pegasi82: you draw that?
It's so much fun.
...And then butler exploded.
BladedWings: eeyup
weeping_pegasi82: Nice Changeling ^w^

butler: Quite, my good sir!
indeed is my tagline
Right-o then, lad!
I'd also throw some British slang in, but I'm Danish, so balls to that.

stupid flash crash :|
BladedWings: I know that feel
2 hours later....
who are the best Ponies Let'player xD ?
well, I just got to Cole trains "flashback" part
Meh, don't watch LP. If I want a game, I'll go download the bloody game.
i really feel bad for him,
True story
i mean ponies lets players xD
hey SR
Get a D fib for that Guy D:
Vordox: That's what would've happened, but Hasbro decided it was too graphic.
Yo SR
Silly Cole Train :3
Or his view on it
Or was it Sumica.
the name of the video is '' Two Best Sisters Play a Game'' xD
Oh, Luna can be in my dreams any night.
No, that's not a goddamn innuendo.
i wish to dream of the mane six
I don't
I would be insane pony
insane? or brainwashed?
I wonder how many artists died while creating the parts for Applejack as a filly baby
Or did they go the Monthy Python Route
butler: Be awake for at least 20 hours. 1 hour before going to sleep, have a cup of coffee. Right before going to sleep, watch an episode. When lying in your bed, lie on your back with your hands down your side. If something is itching, ignore it. While you fall asleep, mentally describe to yourself the main characters in the show, as well as what you'd like to happen in the dream.
Where one part was made of one artist, so they can't get full view
exists sea ponys
Bam. Lucid dream.
Having two dogs, I don't often get to lucid dream, but I do my bloody research.
20 hours?
At least, yeah.
I'm awake about 24-40 hours in a row...
i dont drink coffee
Somedays even 3 days
Kammerjunk: Tried some dream recall last night. Result: Never got to sleep. XD
I'm no Lucid :P
butler: Well, get some caffeine.
GilDash: Hah, shame.
Oh yeah, and the moment you wake up, write down everything you can remember. Helps you in the future.
Kammerjunk: I know. I had times set up for REM cycles and everything.
Is Sumica or Shizuka awake?
RE?
13maybe
Ugh, that reminds me of the Uberman sleeping cycle.
REM?
Shizuka: Perhaps an idea is to "signature" the images in the stream offline?
Some of them aren't marked with a signature after all
Did someone say Monty Python?:P
Graywolf71: Me. :P
Well, it -does- say "OFF AIR".
Kammerjunk: Is that the one where you awake 4 hours, sleep 15 minutes, and repeat or something?
Kammerjunk: Yeah but signature names/Links to the creators of the images.
GilDash: More or less, yeah.
Vordox: Oh.
Dat Rarity peek
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
Our chief weapon is surprise!
i do!
Surprise and fear... Fear and surprise...
or both
Our -two- weapons are fear and surprise! ...And ruthless efficiency...
that makes 3
or the Soul *,.......,*
oooohhhh!
butler: Our THREE weapons are fear, surprise and ruthless efficiency! And an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope...
why are u still adding things?
Our FOUR- no...
spit it all out!
AMONGST our weapons... Amongst our weaponry are such elements as fear, surprise...
I'll come in again.
k
why did the hobbit get so many mixed reviews? i thought it was awsome
me too!
superretroworld: It's the high frame rate thing
Critics jumped on that as an excuse to bash the film.
CriticKitten: Dammit, that means the file will be bigger.
i think its because lotr is generally very long
Back
every movie that is
I'm IshBestPony, mo appo fwitta
Okay, I think I got it all down.
OMG O,......,o what are you talking about ? at 02:23:18 - 02:23:28
/me licks MadScientIsht
/me eats AdamTheDuck's fles
*flesh
D:
Most Blu-Ray quality runs at 60 fps, which is above the high-frame-rate of The Hobbit's theatrical release (48 fps)
haha
But it just depends.
Okay, here we go. I think I got it down.
NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!
k
Kammerjunk I expect an inquisitionof spanish origind
Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as: fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, and nice red uniforms- Oh damn.
*origins
Not that it really matters THAT much. The film critics complained that high frame rate made them motion sick, but that's because they're sissies who are used to 24 fps and tons of motion blur.
:P
nice. thanks a bunch, laddie!
^,.....,^'' ehmm what are you talking about xD ?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tym0MObFpTI
I expect the Spanish Inquisition to knock on my door
CriticKitten: And that's why I have no respect for a whole lot of critics.
I will meet the Spanish Inquisition with nothing but my trusty towel.
A towel has immense phychological value, you know.
There is a video on Youtube of the Inquisition scene that uses Trixie
/me knocks on DerpyMuffins windows
Who's there?
me i keel you
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition
!
Now one complaint I do admit has some logic to it is that films running at higher fps will need to make sure their props are a lot better in quality, because at a higher fps, eyes will be able to adjust to an object's appearance better and (logically) could probably tell a prop from the real thing more easily.
But I didn't see it at higher fps so I don't know if that was actually a problem in the movie.
/me fetches the comfy chair
Wow, Wrek was streaming into well past midnight
I feel sorry for the guy
I still think recording at 24 FPS is silly.
But my own personal opinion of The Hobbit? It was better than Fellowship, honestly, so if people wanna bitch about how it executes things poorly, I demand they go rewatch Fellowship. >_>
:D
yeah and the audiance could sleep thru it all
CriticKitten: Well, you sound like you know where your towel is.
doesnt get it
The cast is a bit of a problem, but that's more the book's fault for giving us 13 dwarves that aren't all very well differentiated.
butler: Well, you see, towels are important and have immense psychological value.
thx
But otherwise, the film's great, honestly.
yup...
And the folks complaining about it are nutters.
If a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, et cetera, et cetera.
I know this because my parents complained, and my parents are nutters. I REST MY CASE.
Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have "lost".
The First Pony on the Moon.....
Kammerjunk: You sounds like quite the froody dude.
On second thought let us not got to Canterlot, it is a silly place.
Though, I guess I could reasonably understand the complaint about it feeling too long.
ok new topic
It does sort of feel like Jackson crammed in a bit too much of the Tolkien lore, probably more than he needed to. But until I see the other two, hard to really say for sure.
GilDash: Oh yeah, you sass Ictiv? Now that was a hoopy frood who knew his Adams.
Douglas Adams, and Jim Morrison, two men I have read about that make me want to actually try hitch hiking across continents.
Then i realize that is crazy
And I like my computer.
Wither : Chaos is magic
Barbetos: Yeah, don't go hitchhiking.
baaaadfdd!
Hack in their day, when Jim, and Douglas where young it was not athat big a deal
Kammerjunk: Honestly, your references are top-notch.
Today it just seems hopelessly romantic, and idiotic if attempted.
hi everypony i'm back
Ohai Dark92Enigma
