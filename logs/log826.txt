Hoi Derpy!
spike is best pony
<_ <
I liked the episode because of the natural dialogue between the Mane 6.
13 episode
Seriously.
It's episodic this season. There really isn't anything where you need to have seen the previous episodes.
i hope for another season i don't want it to end that
Ehh
S3 isn't the best
00,10then to be imeadeatly followed by mass drinking of the specal kool-aid
inb4 speculation on S4 :p
Gak!
lol
Basically, yeah.
00,10and with that I go to sleep
All S3 did was made a few things canon
dream of ponies
And I guess Too Many Pinkie Pies made more sense to people already familiar with previous episodes written by Polsky.
Hello Everypony
my fav canon is the theatre
-_-
It was planned for Season 2?
Yeah.
gonna go make some lunch, maybe play some xbox...:O SHINEDOWN~
yet i feel derpy was left out this season
hey everypony! whats going on? :)
ugh....
In that regard, season 3 feels like a sort of season 2.5. Everything they couldn't cram into the 26 episode norm.
you sound depressed
/me sings along
ahhhh
!cd
':P
it is thats episode 10 not 11
Yeah, they seem to be focusing on other background ponies to, well, put in the background. It keeps things interesting.
That is starting to look like an awkward position

How ironic is this?
"i dont think you speled that right"
"speled"
lies.

why was i kicked... :(
Lies?
Sorry for my name, guys. It's my Xbox gamertag... :D
It got leaked last night apparently
LOL
no
from itunes
Anyway, you got any suggestions SR?
<3
A keyboard
yeah have to say this looks awesome
waiting for movie night
My current one is dying
yeah, I was thinking that too
cause its a auction
it's happened way too many times now to be an accident
Okay
Mostly because I have nothing to spend.
Hello everypony.
Just play Team Fortress 2. Free-to-play, and fun.
I mean something that isn't 30 years old
me neither
yo
hai
I just got "They Bleed Pixels" and "The Walking Dead"
whats the first one?
oh wait
nvm
I have 2987 internets.
Its like a combat/precision platformer that is fun and simple. but hard
Yes
I do
they're all pretty much the same
http://pckeyboard.com/page/category/UKBD
in lovecraftian style
always when i ask my parents something, they say 'google it'
and they're not even that expensive
gunna lose those internets
lovecraftian style is best style
...
yes they are the most popular keyboard amoung programmers.
back
hai
I dunno man, steampunk is pretty awesome too
I'm back.
I'm not sure if I want a buckling spring though
hmmm
I like mechanical keyboards.
I do too
if you dont care for them, just grab whatever one you find at bestbuy.
People still uploaded it though
steamcraft or lovepunk
XD
...
that name made me think of that milk pony
Bubblepunk.
does anyone here have an oc?
I'd prefer brown or blue mechanical
I don't even use itunes and I watched it already
me
evryone has an oc
I use itunes on my phone
Roleplay?
I don't. I am not creative enough
But because its convinent.
I don't have one. all the good color schemes are taken, and I don't want to be unoriginal.
I would not pay $79 for a keyboard
I don't draw, I cannot into music, I only write for fun, and I wouldn't RP as a single character.
You would if it was sick
I never would
I would because I like to use the same keyboard for a long time because I get used to it.
brb
I'm using an apple aluminum one right now
Ive been using shitty keyboards for a long time and I always replace them every few months because they start to suck
I regularly switch between two completely differently sized laptops
It's nice, but it's not mechanical
Hello everypony.
I like Appletavia.
the cello is preeeeeeeeeeeetty :)
yo
DJ-T4VI is best ship.
:-O
I had no idea people even thought this much about keyboards. XD
I like the thin keys, but I hate this keypad
What's for Movie Night?
I want a tenkeyless
If I needed one I'd just buy the cheapest one at Target
no
Other than, like, pressing 50 keys at once
really?
I dunno, as long as I can type with it, I'm good
...
Never learned about keyboards in any of my classes
my tv-box thingy doesn't want to turn on -.- whaa! hate that!
Hi everypony :)
Well there are essentially 2 main types of keyboards
yo
after all spoilers
Cheapy cheap boring china made common pathetic plastic keyboards
I found the character interactions the only redeeming part.
There were many holes in the plot.
And mechanical keyboards
maybe hes a duel screen user
if you wanted to.
Well I would believe that
are we talking about plot holes in a kid's show again?
Code at all. It all suddenly appeared...
This song reminds me of something from Descent.
at least we know now that Rainbow Dash writes fanfics
:D
the CGI just stuck out horribly. IMHO
Particularly Descent 3.
Because of the feel
I have no issues with my cheapy cheap boring china keyboards
Do you know it?
sorry
Yea
but okay
it*
..
...
Why would I want chicks? :P
To sell to meth.
I would not have the patience to draw this.
Are you saying
You don't want
chicks
http://narciejeter.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/baby-chicks.jpg
have no problem with merryweather williams either, she wrote quite some nice episodes.
Look at them
Not really
they'll grow up into chickens
I want another Luna episode
i wish it displayed song title next to his logo
I still want a Celestia and Luna ep....
Fine
Yea Meriwether Williams had been on a really good episode streak, but this episode kinda threw it off
I think Merriweather's best episode is Wonderbolt Academy
Last ps2 rolled off the assembly line.
hearths warming eve was good too
Yea
I never owned a ps2.
Shed a tear man
and dragonquest
Because they're done
Discorf ep
nooo
More done than a steak at a crappy restaurant
The feel, the adventure, and Rarity
I just think that in this episode spike was kinda out of character.....
And you ordered it medium rare, but the chef is an idiot
I like to think I am not a shitty programmer
:P
I never claimed you were, i was just making a point about equipment.
I'm a pretty shitty programmer
discord*
hi ho is everypony
Or at least I think I am

I've never really compared myself to a non shitty programmer

I felt the problem with Cars 2 was it was focused too much on that tow truck.
He killed dem guys!
oh well .then it's ok
Cars 2 was overrated.
and hungry
it really was
From his evil twin family.
sooo there is no derpy in season 3?
Actually cars 2 wasn't overrated at all, the critics panned it
cus retartds?
more pizza plants
Nope.avi
Anons are usually all trolls... well all the ones i've met have been...
I really shouldn't be complaining about it though. I have adblockplus running too.

Next movie?

It was good.

Does anyone remember that digimon thing or whatever it's called?
Digimon? The show?
No it was a handheld thing
I loved both of those movies.
Never seen it
But i'm sorry, but Home Alone 1 and 2 are the shit.
I had digimon cards in elementary school
I only watched Digimon a few times
lol
I never understood any of the tv shows that had card games and I never watched them
Todd should stay in the shadows
I just got the cards because everyone else had them.
OH ANOTHER PEAS ON EARTH JOKE, right?
OH
He planned THIS?!
BULLSHIT

HOW THE FUCK DID HE DO THIS IN ONLY A HALF HOUR
We can argue without taking it personally and holding a grudge just because one of us was wrong.
Without anyone noticing?!
to be fair I was pretty pushy

Spike is the biggest clutz in this ep.
Eva Pigford
He is good at thinking for others.
nonesense plot, nosthjing for kids really to learn, and generaslly awkward to just watch it, this ep was awful :/

Pinkie's plan's more fun
Especially Piratebay
OK, I think I can believe that.
Yes Pinkie, you can wear da stashe
Dem drawlings

Porn is not thepiratebay
pnikies plan would probably work too

Critics jumped on that as an excuse to bash the film.
i think its because lotr is generally very long
Back
every movie that is
Okay, I think I got it all down.
/me eats AdamTheDuck's fles
*flesh
D:
Most Blu-Ray quality runs at 60 fps, which is above the high-frame-rate of The Hobbit's theatrical release (48 fps)
haha
But it just depends.
Okay, here we go. I think I got it down.

A towel has immense phychological value, you know.
Who's there?
me i keel you
!
/me fetches the comfy chair
I still think recording at 24 FPS is silly.
:D
yeah and the audiance could sleep thru it all
doesnt get it
The cast is a bit of a problem, but that's more the book's fault for giving us 13 dwarves that aren't all very well differentiated.
butler: Well, you see, towels are important and have immense psychological value.
thx
But otherwise, the film's great, honestly.
yup...
And the folks complaining about it are nutters.
I know this because my parents complained, and my parents are nutters. I REST MY CASE.
The First Pony on the Moon.....
Though, I guess I could reasonably understand the complaint about it feeling too long.
Then i realize that is crazy
And I like my computer.
baaaadfdd!
hi everypony i'm back
hello
