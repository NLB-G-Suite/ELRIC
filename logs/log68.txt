Aponymous, Rarity is indeed pale gray.
11ValtheJean: What blasphemy?
3 DAAAAAYS!
You're just noticing that?
and then the moon FALLS!
Not bad, just... odd.
take a drink for magic
0how can rainbow dash be someone's waifu? same sex marriage is only legal in like 5 states
10ReticentSmolder I think it's because she played KITTY PRYDE in xmen, that's probably why I'm so goddamn smitten with her. Holy shit Kitty Pryde is just SO. AWESOME.
Only 3 days?
CHAT LAG

11Pinkie: The ultimate librarian.
I didn't notice that at first either
pretty sure rarity is white
Old Thundercats was the greatest thing EVAR! That was my freaking childhood!
wat if pinkie got the wings
I love how Rarity asks selfless at the beginning of the episode, but then almost immediately becomes incredibly selfish.
Thundercats and He-man memories kinda blur together.
I should drill a little hole so it can vent properly xD

Oh ya Travis Touchdown

Plot shot
thetrollside, mind. blown.
Rarity doesnt have Pegisi wings so no shes not an alicorn
They told me i could become anything, so i became a butterfly

/me MOAR MOVIE TRIVIA: Although in the scene outside the high school everyone was dressed in jackets, coats, hats etc... It was actually near 80 degrees while filming. In fact, when the camera cut, they brought umbrellas over the principal actors to keep them in the shade.

This film is a stylish pornographic musical disguised as a regular musical. It's actually quite good.
What is this movie called again?
<< I know zero trivia about this
OOOO OY MOM! OWH YA DOIN!
Silverscreen, Jim Sturgess (the British dude) is English.
0oh okay

Across teh beatlesverse
Sol, challenge accepted
11Ghosties: Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a british accent: but those accents don't sound natural at all.
my beatles posters approve of this movie
Teakettle is loud
DragonRage has listened to Electrical Beast. He doesn't judge the authenticity of British accents anymore.
She just loves the Beatles, and has 142 or so of their songs.
DING
OOOOOO DAT ACCENT IS A BEAUTY THERE!
There are like 200 different british accents
whats this movie
@SilverScreen its because that's a Scottish limey accent
Best shits? what?
Fluttershy is yaying
8we are hemorrhaging viewers for this movie
Let's not even get into the Irish accents.
DING
11reticentSmolder: ah, thank you.
Rogert Ebert said this movie was great. I trust Roger Ebert. End of story.
i have all the albums and singles but never seen this movie :/
4I can't tell the difference between a fake one and a real one. I've only ever spoken to two Brits, and that's RBD and Dman
Feck. Potato.
4RBD moreso
lol
the best accent is the boring monotone accent
He's shooting for a Liverpool dialect. Does it work? ..... eh
British accents are super sexy. Except this one.
DAT BE A IRISH BOY WITH A PHOTOSHOP BOYO!
@Ghosties he really does have an accent
No wonder
I mostly trust Ebert
That's Jim Sturgiss
its not very good...

I trust Armin White the most.
Slap him and have ANGRY SEX
where's doctor who?

The movie actually is pretty good. It's just that a character or two and some of the scenes are just kind of put in there only as excuses to get more songs in.
Yay Ghosties! Us brits ain't that bad!
/me K guys, he is going to the US to find his long last dad-o

WEEEE OOOOOOOOOOHHHH WRIT HOME OOOO!
HAHAHAHAHAHA
This is like a giant tribute to the Beatles.
musical
Write home from a boat... yea
nice
Amorphic it's a musical featuring only beatles music
WF_Chronicles, I think that's mostly a misunderstanding. What he means by art is not the same as most people. Of course, he also doesn't think most movies live up to being "art"
RainBroDash, you missed the intro and HelterSkelter, oh and some 60's high school shit
What you think is British is English.
11RainBroDash: mmkay. ^.^
ENGLISH!
ENGRISH BEATLES!
CMON BREAK OUT IN SONG AND DANCE ALREADY.

10FUCK I MISSED HELTER SKELTER?!

*Clops hooves in time with musc*

Why do I keep getting knocked out of the video?
Darken_Skye I think he's actually singing.
they need to get a better computer/laptop
Helter Skelter will pop up later
@Darken_Skye no, he actually has a very nice voice
Northern London accents sound extremely fake.
there was no autotune back in my day /oldfag look

The musics good, but that's all thy focus on, there should be gaps

Is there a lesbian scene? Because that could keep the numbers up.
Silverscreen More like High School Musical: Beatles Edition
@Axel_Foaley unfortunately the movie version isn't NEARLY as good as the broadway version

HEy JUDE
2007
I think
/me MOAR MOVIE *TRIVIA* This film was released in the United States on John Lennon's birthday (October 9th).
If this movie is called 'Across the universe' i somehow feel ripped-off.
6It was a ban that literally meant nothing, RBD
4Guys, my video crashed
8Denied_Existence: 2007 IIRC
I never saw the movie version.
TAXI!
This dude looks legit
6And was set ages ago.
IS there a point to the singing or is it just "lolBeatles"
that ban was hilarious sprinkles
Pick him up
It is, Brony1
Ghosties: Maybe it's saying something.
OOOO EY LADDY MEH WILL PICK YA UP WITH A LOE!

Aponymous, give it time.
WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE KITCHEN
OOOOOH YEAH AAAAHHH

This is a musical? YOU DON'T SAY.
But it's Lucy's first sleep over. And she needs to do it by the book.

4To be honest, I really didn't think A Pig's Tale was all that bad.
They could make the film better by just playing the beatles over the cover versions
LOL I know
/me switches movie music with Pink Floyd music.

Is he bowling himself
smoke weed?
"Lets just start singing in a bowling alley!" Nothing odd here, I sing each time I enter a bowling alley too
"K Guys There *WILL* be good songs. Fix'd
That makes a frightening amount of sense
And then Lucy murdered every single person in the alley with her own bowling ball.
8we're just expressing our opinions about it
LETS GO TO NY!
WHEEEE
Brony Bowling Meet-ups, we need them!
Or Charlotte's Web.

rapidash: Come on, Xanadu was THE shit in musicals.

/me yes, there *WILL* be orgies later in the movie

And later that night the hospital was crowded with back injuries
Are they all drunk or high os something?
8o hai DCD with no colors

ohai NewDCD, we missed you
I take it you've not beaten marisa or scarlets stories :P
I mean, I'm not enjoying it much either, but the first thing i said when it was picked (after a boxxy reference) was I'm handing in my man card and giving it a go

rapidash: THE shit, as in good.
orgy
6and I got clear to sanae
Yes, DCD why is your leg in a cast?
Hina spins to win~
/me RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA IF YOU STILL CARE: Sadie, with her fiery red hair and passionate temper, is a reference to Janis Joplin. Sadie is even seen drinking directly from a Jack Daniels bottle during her downward spiral, an action that Janis did regularly with Southern Comfort. Even Janis' throaty singing voice is used by Sadie in the movie.
I just can't enjoy the film
6which is saying a lot
I'm sorry
THIS DOESN'T LOOK SUSPICIOUS AT ALL.
0when is the shark gonna eat them?
kaythen, bai ponies
Sanae is a good girl. |3

Aya's timeout card.

Doc Brown is in this movie?

So why's it letter b?
Letter B.
0why arent they singing tu pak?
A AWNSER!
I'm being serious, you're telling me I can't voice my opinion on the film unless it's hated by EVERYBODY
Hipster_Brony: Singing. Lots and lots of singing with some story thrown in for good measure.
XD
13Lol Hipster
I don't know, maybe Letter A was an asshole.
Wow, this is.... seriously good
Magic of music<Magic of friendship
you've put off some viewers by ostracising this film. doing that to spiders web did nothing similar of the sort
They don't do a very good job in explaining that then, do they?
slash b slash
13Welcome to my world
@Hipster_Brony this is the community experience the backlash from the race riots of the 60's
That's not fair, at all

11EXPLAIN!
Took too much of the poison joke.. and that will cause any pony to croke
You're telling me that Spider's Web is okay to hate because nobody likes it, but I can't hate on this film because some people like it
Here is a good part
I'm just saying you've been a bit cruel to the person who picked it, and the people who enjoy this kind of film, and that could hurt the viewer count
7damn... the tone of this movie changed so soon..
EXPLAIN *nuclear blast*
How is that fair
/me @WF_Chronicles one of the characters is indeed based off of Jimi Hendrix, he's is a badass
Come together
And now the token black guy joins the crew.

/me FOR POPULAR DEMAND: PLOT DETAILS The movie is a social breakdown of the late 60's and 70's, namely the changes brought on by the Vietnam war, the draft, and race relations. If you are confused as to why this guy is important its because he meets the rest of the cast later.
dancing crackheads
I KNOW YEW
o.o
Dat spinning.
because the mods led the viewers into a collaborative hate on his favourite genre
I won't deny that the mods have some amount of influence to the regular viewers, but if you think I'm going to just keep quiet because some people get upset that I can't tolerate this film, then that's completely unfair.
11So, I'm guessing that there were two funerals. One was for the girlfriend's father who was killed in war. The other was a young black boy who was killed during the Civil Rights Riots that took place back then.

0SHE LIED, THE HORROR
RANDOM SINGING
/me MOVIE BACKGROUND: Prudence is an archetype for beaten women and the way society glossed over their existence for awhile. She is a lesbian and her last relationship with a man ended rather badly.
This movie would probably be better if he WAS surrounded by promiscuous dope fiends.
I will not change who I am just because it upsets a few people
However
I just want you to realise that you've ostracised a crowd by doing so
yes why don't we do it in the room?
i can'ts stand this noise!
I will publicly apologize to ReticentSmolder
SHE ALREADY IS!
sounds reasoable
Thanks for the facts, reticentsmolder!
Dee_Twenty, it is.
Hey, he's got Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix
Lesbian + man. WTF u smoking ReticentSmolder
Not smoking before the 2000s.... NOT COOL
WAAHAHPOOO!

Goddamn Muffin-Headed Fucking Liberals- George Gordon Haggard Jr.
Chiyo, are you calliong the Beatles new-age?

@ReticentSmolder that's too much plot for this movie to handle
LEVERAGE TIME?
i am tommy weaseh HUUUUH
Like I said, at the end of the film, I'm going to address ReticentSmolder and apologize
Did someone say leverage chat?
I find it amusing that this was chosen as the A movie when it has a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not bad though.
/me BEATLES TRIVIA: The Cavernous club seen in the UK side of the alternating vignettes at the opening of the film is the 'New' Cavern Club in Liverpool. The original Cavern Club where the where The Beatles played in the 60s was closed in 1973 and the site became a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's underground railway.

@Silverscreen What you talkin bout?
DID SOMEBODY SAY LEVERAGE!?

Aren't The Beatles dead?
No... I'm a woman... of course I'm not okay
welcome to my cafe huuuuh
Leverage?
THERE BE NO LEVERAGE IN HER
no, Paul is alive
HERE
A bad movie does not equal B movie...
Only half the Beatles are dead
I just saw the viewer count drop by 50 AS SOON as I'd got my stream back up, and that was like 2 songs in?
and so is ringo
Nyx, half are.
Did we watch Battlefiel Earth while I was gone? D:
The good ones are dead
"Cafe, Huh?" As if the cafe didn't know what it wanted to call itself.
0HOW COULD THEY DO THAT TO THE BEATLES CLUB PLACE THING
Oh Hai Jude how is your sex life
Paul is alive. Irony.
bah, i hate losing viewers :<
Paul is a drama queen, and no one gives a crap about Ringo.
8that wasnt because of ghosties though
Sol lol true
Nyx: Yes, we did
@Nyx yes we did
Drrk, no. He's alive.
DRAFT YA!
poor ringo
uh oh
D:
thought i'd check up on you fillyfoolers

0boxcow has no leverage
Pirate Radio had a plot compared to this.

no, and I apologise for being rude ghosties
although in reality paul died years ago(conspiracy, yay!)
FUCK RINGO
Leverage XD

Drafted
@AlCapony What if it wanted to be called 'Dudes and Coffee?
If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would still eat meat.
/me Guess what? He doesn't dodge the draft.
I think he'll be fine in Vietnam.
ringo has the most money because he's the baws
There was much Leverage.
DRAFT.
SOUNDS LIKE A COOL IDEA
8like i said, its not a particularly popular genre, especially not among males 18-24
Paul is dead, yes
Drrk, no. No no no no no no no.
I LEIK CHOCOLATE MILK
erbody got aida and shit

0but they did that anyway
Actually, they did take homos in the sixties.
Legit idea
Say you're a brony!
Remember that part where they broke the glass just cause? I liked that movie. So much leverage.
RAPE
BAM PAEDOFILE SIGHTED
It's fine, RBD. I got pretty upset too
just those looking like her
And the cameramen were so drunk
oOooOOOooooOooOOOOoo
Say you're a brony
Just say you're a pedophile lol
THE DRAFT BOARD.
Yes, say you're a Brony. You're free!
And Hipster's right, musicals are not popular amongst are age group
inb4 ironically Ringo dies before Paul
Denied_Existence: It couldn't work. They weren't snapping after the music ended. DEEP KEROUAC JIVE MAN.
GO TO CANADA YOU ASS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DID
JAB HIM WITH DAT RUSTY NEEDLE
yea burn the place up
STICKING IT TO THE MAN

/me MOVIE BACKGROUND: if you didn't notice earlier, Jim Sturgess stowed away to get to the US, he came illegally and therefore is not a citizen, thus immune to the draft but not immune to deportation.
Say you're with FOX News. You're definitely going to war.
Paul is in a cat box
Y U BURN THE PAPER

JUDE: FUCK THE PLOT! MORE SINGING

It's not BAD, I don't care for most musicals though...
Nice remixes, bad movie
It's the hormones...
Plot? What plot?
FUCK DA PLOT
it just feels a bit shitty to watch the probable viewer count drop day by day when you're looking forward to watching a film for the first time with so many people, just to see that they're not even gonna give it the time of day
12heh
And Sprinkles, it's not fair to completely ostracize one film without remorse and not be allowed to hate another with consequences
12anyway Aurora did you find the post?
11....
This is boring
11this song sucks.
Fuck da plot while singing you say?
I dunno
Pride like HER
I watch it for da plot
FAIL.
I watch it....for the singing.
you mean the music isn't the plot?
SO, yeah, conversations are happening. yeah.
Beatles songs help somewhat.
Did you just sing a bunch of songs? That's detrimental to the plot!
0Needed Maxwell's silver hammer
shit...
Lacks the Letter B.
/me If you guys can't relate this to the plot you have been reading too much chat :P
there is no plot to speak of
i really do think spiders web is an exception
Screw the plot we have beatles!
First time I saw this, I was skeptical too
11Seriously. This song just plain sucks.

JUST FUCK HER ALREADY SHE WANTS IT BAD YOU CAN TELL BY THE AWFUL SINGING
It's silly
It's not fair, though
@Silverscreen yeah it kind of does, but they needed a sappy love song
It was WAY at the beginning and was one of the THOUSANDS of references in this movie

OH SNAP

So you take a movie where the entire schtick is being filled with Beatles music... and you don't actually use any of the Beatles' recordings. Does not compute.
That's gotta be a rude awakening for Max.
Ooops

@LordEchimaru she really does want Sadie, the fact she can't almost drives her to suicide.
/me The following songs become more and more psychadelic as they focus on the use of drugs in contrast to the gritty reality of war raging outside US borders.
Most of these actors have done some sort of singing or broadway
@iHeldAChicken, no, give it a few minutes, it comes later
@Silverscreen, did you read my comment about the psychadelicism?

Never seen him break into song? Bullshit.
/me 9punches XNA till it works
Not Luna, but SOCKS!
/me The similarities between the actual message and how it's used here are uncanny. They, in essence, both advocate against the war and radicalism in politics.
Trixie in socks looks good
"I CAME HERE TO SING AT YOU!"
http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/afd75b68-a5b4-458f-be28-1c867e588ee6.gif

War sucks.
/me 12HIDES
And now we're in 1968.
and Jude is grumpy because Lucy likes the dude more than him
@silverscreen they had a MASSIVE falling out, she liked the hippy activist dude more than him for his political views, it ends up being a bad idea

Also, we lost Martin Luther King.

RanYakumo SAS... side-angle-side? what is SAS?
/me During the performance of Strawberry Fields, the main characters watch TV. In the counter shot we see the same image projected on their faces. This is a reference to the promotional video that the Beatles made to accompany the song when it was released.

8i did a Spiderman x Spiderman ship
Hipster_Brony, that was fucking hilarious.
That fluttershy!
OH thanks!
they're pretty much Army Swat
/me Jude's life progression is similar to John Lennon's. As John Lennon did, Jude first lived in Liverpool then soon after that moved to New York City to work as an artist like Lennon. Jude then encounters trouble with the law and is deported (Lennon was arrested as well, but an attempt to deport him failed).
or like Seal Team 6
8but it was in a thread that was already spiderman'd
Oh right his solos are supposed to be awful

@Denied_Existence that's musicals for ya. Yes, the beds were arranged like a revolving gun, hence the spinning, and the song is "Happiness is a Warm Gun" to further prove this point
03LOL

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

Jude, yer a wizard
@Denied_Existence he borrows from the influence of psychadelic drugs a lot, I wouldn't be surprised if he hadn't had some before
there is no friendship in this movie... only magic
They're not being violent. They're fighting violence... with violence
03LOL @ Kelso

6With a capital N O.
Back to the beginning
But yeah
As seen in the opening

Remember the beginning?
if you people don't get it
I don't
@ReticentSmolder Yeah, me neither...

the implication is that she was killed in the blast
No way

So that bit about them paying such a high price for the Beatles songs is a little disingenuous as sony was one of the backers for the film.
her soul died when she realized hippies were the dirty scum of the earth

The police interrupting the show alludes to how it really was at the Beatles' last concert in London while filming Let It Be.

Morale: Life happens... so get high and listen to Beatles music
So many characters and so little personality that I can only be bothered to remember the black guy who has my sister's name.
ReticentSmolder, actually, it's a reference to Apple Corps
/me They borrow the logo too, but with a strawberry, this scene in particular mirrors an actual Beatle's concert held atop a rooftop.
8well this is awkward
7After this movie i'm gone as it's 6:14 AM.. And i'm tired
They're attracting people

Indeed
Sadie and Jojo are back together
ANOTHER SPOILER: That dude shaves his beard after this movie is over.
"Hello? Human Fly here! Come on, I spent all night dying my underwear!"
@Sol right, I was close :D
Not at all, Hip. He used to hate you as well, but says that outside of ponies and music, you're an alright guy

Reticent: That was Across the Universe, yes?

Thanks for enlightening us ReticentSmolder

0ITS THE POOL NUDE SCENE
6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
THIS IS THE WORST SONG IN THE MOVIE
It had its moments.
6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
ReticentSmolder, thanks for the details
@Sol Ja Klar!
interesting....
The bass in Last Train to London is amazing
6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
6DRUGS ARE ALL YOU NEED
Okay guys
4Oh shit, no mod colors
4Anyways
12hmm
11That was...interesting.
4I just wanna say something to the room so we can understand a few things
11Just...interesting.
4First of all, I'm gonna apologize to ReticentSmolder.
03LOL
4He picked the film, and I don't want him to think that I am chastising or ostracizing him for the film that he picked. I have absolutely no beef or qualm with him at all.
03"Thanks a lot for helping me look for Carla" "No problem I'll check the dumpster"
4That said
13You leik chocolate milk?
12night all~
4I've been told that a few people on here were voicing their concerns about me to other mods, and I would be very appreciative if you would say it to me in a PM.
Nii
:)
4Furthermore, it's my right to voice my opinion on a film
4As it is yours
11anyone else in the mood for tacos now?
11just as I was alright with people giving their opinion about my Random Movie Trivia :P
4I may have upset a few people, but they should understand that in now way should my opinion sway that of others. I may be a mod, but I'm also a regular person too
03"you might find out the very same thing you hate is the thing you'll end up missing when it's gone"
03Nah, I won't hate apple if they go out of business
4After all, I didn't kick anybody that was bitching and moaning during Evil Dead II and plenty of people were complaining about it the whole time
8see ya tomorrow sathi
4So, EVERYBODY has the right to complain.
8 /today
4And yes
6Long story short, if you have a problem, with ANY of us, we'd appreciate it if you RESPECTFULLY said it to our (cyber) faces instead of going behind our backs about it. We'll only find out about it later.
4I hated this film
11This movie was....really fucking weird.
4So, again, I'm sorry to ReticentSmolder. I have no problem with you
4I just fucking HATE musicals
11That's the only conclusion I have for it.
6Hear that everypony? If you get picked in the lotto, pick a musical.
4And no, no amount of tolerance will change that
11I mean, half the songs were good, half of them were shit. The story's hard to follow if you don't know US history that well.
7Im just glad we had someone giving background information..
4It was my OPINION
4Got it?
11and the style was ALL over the place.
11just...just fucking weird.
11Not good. Not bad. Just weird.
4Like I said, I didn't kick any of you guys when you bitched about my movie choice a few months ago
/me 10liked it
4So yeah, if you have a problem with me. Say it to my, as Sprinkles said, Cyber face
4Thank you
4And I hope you enjoyed the film
SHINY
can we move on in the chat now? i think the point has been clearly made
4And Bruce Campbell
11That said, thanks for coming by for this week's BMN. We look forward to seeing you next week when we watch Inception and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
02hey
4Cause he's awesome
6That said, we welcome any and all kinds of movies, as changes of pace are good. Just as long as they're... movies and not SW:APT
8LOUD
LUNA IS BEST PONY!
4That's right, we welcome all kinds of movies
I agree that the film was weird. And why would people bitch about Evil Dead II? lol. I love that series. Army of Darkness is probably my favorite we'rve watched together.
LUNA IS BEST PONY!
inb4after ghosties hates this movie
I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who doesn't like at least 75% of all the Beatle's songs.
LOUD
And furthermore It hurt my feelings.
Ghosties, you cool.
Last Train to Transcentral > Last Train to London
Don't feel bad Ghosties. As a person who has a great appreciation for musicals, I hated this film as well
i used to hate musicals too...
@Ghosties, I realize that musicals aren't everyone's cup of tea, and I really appreciate your honesty. It takes real strength to apologize like that, thank you man, <3 you. I totally get where you're coming from and I respect your opinion.
SOCKS
/me pats Ghosties on the shoulder
I think you need to be a Beatles fan to truly appreciate this movie, but that's just *my* opinion ;)
lol I like your random movie trivia, Silverscreen
Don't worry... Ponies fix everything
NYX IS BEST PONY
i'd like to start with a request for the postshow
DAT VLC MeDIA PLAYER
Can't read my, can't read my, no you can't read my cyber face. o/`
Is it because you can't sing Ghosties? Is that why you don't like musicals?
LUNA IS BEST PONY!
T TT T T TURBOCHAT
@ReticentSmolder That movie was...interesting...but it did give me a perspective on that time period. So I rate it 3/5!
no gokaiger?
I loved the trivia
i usually don't like remixes / 8bit music
but this is SO EPIC
I want tacos.
The movie was of a really now quality. When they sang Hey Jude, I melted, but otherwise...the songs were REALLY mediocre. The plot was all over the place, the characters were flat, and the movie looked for all the world like you did drugs before you turned it on. The plot was just there to justify using Beatles music.
DAT CONE
WINTER WRAPUP 1
/r/ GOOOOOOOOOOOKAIGER
NO!
I'm out, g'night all.

10also: someone at my school did a cover of the fresh prince of bel air theme with the story of Fiddler, called "Fiddler on the spoof (The Fresh Prince of Anatevka)" silverscreen :P
With that gay pig thing
But if anyone likes the Phantom Menace...
Welcome pretender! I was here for the first movie night but I don't come that often anymore.
WE NEED TO WATCH JURASSIC PARK
Except for pinkie pie. Pinkie Pie multiplied by socks = nnoooooooo
11That's hilarious.

RainBroDash: That sounds. AWESOME.
That was well timed

wibbles drake
04thanks
04Heya Shiny

Still my favorite PMV right here.
Oh god
I just find it funny that my first time watching Inception will be with other bronies
BEST SONG EVAR

Def fav PMV.
THEM GODDAMN HUNS!
SCREW JURASSIC PARK LETS WATCH MULAN!
After this, the Jackie Chan version plz?
11Inception is a good movie so long as you can keep up with the first half.

11LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS. TO DEFEAT. THE HUNS!
04I can't - I need to buy something
I'll make mare out you
inception is my favorite movie
BANE
HEY EVERYBODY!
Inception. Not sure if want after being compared to the Matrix.
you're late.
man, writing a new character for larp is harder than i remembered, probably since i'm trying ot make a caster for once.
scruffy did not make me sad at all
And if you liked Attack of the Clones, we will have words.
OH GOD THE BEST DISNEY SONG NOT NAMED ZERO TO HERO
reminds me of when we watched mulan
BANE?!?

11DID THEY SEND ME FILLIES
EVERYPONY
10silverscreen it's on his youtuve if you wanna see it haha, it's not -that- funny, but in theory it's pretty funny :P
11WHEN I ASKED.
"Mr, I'll make a mare out of you
FTFY
Inception: Like the Matrix, but unpreteniously smart.
11FOR SONS!
Is this one of this last for as long as possible things?
02Really? Hmm
/me RANDOM ME TRIVIA I almost chose Mulan as my B movie idea, but thought that Mad Max would be better
Why wub this song
10youtube*
I love Inception, except for the goddamn fanboy conspiracy theories about the end.
Cause I could stay up ALL NIGHT
*5th place
ReticentSmolder, how is mulan a b movie?
I...
For some reason
am so. high right now
I think those theories are the best part.
Applebloom!
ASIANS
11ReticentSmolder: You wouldn't have been allowed.
Also, like, Leonardo Decaprio has finished redeeming himself for Titantic.
oh mmyy gggoooddd
@SilverMane its slightly older? i dunno
Inception is one of the rare good movies
11We already watched Mulan on here.
Mulan was already shown
hey, how long until requests?
crap
dern
I loved Inception, all the people yapping about the ending never heard of "Ambiguity" before.
/me appreciates ReticentSmolder 's choice
mulan is cool
@Silverscreen, well good thing huh? lol
the ending was the best part.
Mulan is pretty decent
Make a man outta you
Meh, I never liked Mualn.
Browser crashed...
THEM DAMN HUNS
:/
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/thumb/131162806926s.png NYX >:}
I think it was purposefully ambiguous FOR the theories.
Why did the Asian got shot first in Inception?
No ambiguity about the Inception ending, unless you didn't actually watch the movie.
Drake, just get alien swarm :P
13I'm still waiting for someone to pick Cast Away.
DERN HUNS
lull
13D:
its free i think
02You're Uralooser right?
just don't ruin the end of the movie please.
Inception today is what the matrix was 10 years ago
FUCK Google Chrome
It just supposed to be thought-provoking.
Were you guys okay with what I said in the main room?
Cast Away!
I'll give Inception a fair shot, but comparing it to the Matrix is not a good way to eliminate my apprehensions.
the hinge of my laptop's screen just snapped
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Do you think it was good?
O_O
11The only problem I have with the ending of inception is...DID THE ASIAN FUCKER GET OUT OR NOT?! (being ambiguous sos to not give spoilers.)
SPALDING NOOOOOOOO
As you wish flutterpeanut!
I LOVE CAST AWAY
I think you should do repeats of the best movies after a while for the new bronies.
@FlutterPeanut WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILSON?!
Is matrix ten years old?
Oh I love Cast Away
o-o
We'd better not ruin the movie.
Why the hell am I asking the room
13WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
6I had no issue with it.

YES
lol
I just saw Cast Away on TV
i think that inception was better than matrix
02What did you do NS?
02FOR SHAME
The Asian fucker got out
it's older than hat, starwish
Inception is SO MUCH BETTER than the Matrix.
02I thought I taught you better
there. i said it
I feel like a silly person now
6It was drawn out, but it was cool.
silverscreen - he wakes in the plane with a really depressed / withdrawn face. so i'd say yes.
spoiler: it's a dream
With the guy who's name reminds me of pie
Like, 100% cooler.
We should watch Cast away
BRING ON THE HUNS! I HAVE READ SUN TZU FROM FRONT TO BACK
Silverscreen, yes he did. O.o He's on the plane.
6*shrug* It's not a big deal.
Spoiler: They Go Deeper
Quite honestly, no one should care what someone thinks about the films
PONY POLKA!!!!!!!!!!
9guy I am hurtbutt
i cant wait to see all the spam on inception.
I like this one
damn
I think everyone who isn't stupid thinks that Inception is better than The Matrix
newdcd still not working?
6I was upset to learn ponies were going behind your back though.
@Aponymous I agree...if you are taking the Matrix as a series, the first movie alone against inception is a pretty close race
PONEEE PONEE
I guess I just wanted approval from my fellow co workers
9nope
11Dman: I'd argue, but it'd be spoilerific for people in here....
AWSOME
That's not exactly a high bar you know, being better than the Matrix is about even with being better than a kick in the nuts.
9FUCKING XNA
:O
but that's me.
hahaha
Don't make me put the smackdown on you jive ass neighas, now.
: /
now for friendship is not available
HERCULEESE

Oh, I was too
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131159797526.png
I really mostly want to see Inception after reading the Inception crossover fanfic >.>
SOCKS
I was pretty pissed
9WHY MUST YOU HOLD ME AWAY FROM MY 16-BIT RPG SO
OH SHIT
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOCKS
BWOOOOOOOOOONG.
I'M IN SOCKS
there's an incpetion crossover??
Wow this fits nicely
RAINBOWS MARRK LOOKS LIKE ZEUSES SEAL IN THAT MOVIE
(I AM PROUD OF YOU SON)
Silverscreen so do ya mean if he rode the kick or stayed in there for godknowshowlong? is that what you mean?
ladies and gentlemen
Link me up, brony.
04uh-oh
ReticentSmolder: I completely ignore the sequels.
be prepared to use this button
But now they know to come to me if they have a problem :)
actually, i thought the fic was better than the movie B)
bbl
http://inception.davepedu.com/
I can't exactly fix it ><
this is pretty great
DAD, ARE YOU SOCKS?
BWOOOOOOONG.
AAAAGGHHHH
There's a MLP Inception crossover!
11Who IS the little black mare?!
9YES SON
we need more art of ponies in pajamas
6>implying they actually will
(YES, NOW WE ARE A FAMILY AGAIN)
NYX
9NOW WE CAN BE CLOTHES ENSEMBLE AGAIN
NYX DAMN IT
Nix
They should
yay
YES
Nyx*
NYX SORRY
books: Yeah, it's about Celestia's dream.
CLOTHES ENSEMBLE
I SEE
when will you take requests?
11Nyx?
NYX!
@Aponymous <3 me too
Goddamn this song. :(
I meant that as a question, by the way?
The y makes it fancy
Nyx is best pony
We need more art of ponies period.
yes, nyx. read it
It's a fanfic, "Past Sins"
Thanks for making my Friday night more interesting bronies. See ya next time.
I'll have to look that up later
well, I'm out, later everyone and I'll be here next week
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131159801680.jpg
11The melody of this song throws me off when I try to sing it.
Luna > Nyx > Twilight > Trixie ENOUGH SAID
Byeee
These goggles they do nothing
Cry more
10silverscreen would you like a link to the fresh prince of anatevka? :P
Bye.
this video is nice
Pretty well written, honestly.
But... Luna... Nyx...
Trixie D:
A bit dark for the setting, but good characterization.
11RainbroDash: Nah, I'm enjoying ponies.
04Well, you're in trouble
10I just found it, is all
Nyx, if I remember correctly is a reborn Nightmare Moon without any of the evil or something. Just read Past Sins
Bye books
10K :D
Nyx > Nightmare Moon
04Reminds me when I broke by DS' hinge.
Trixie = Trixie
-_-
what? I was talking to someone else
04Still broken actually. It's annoying.
I have no idea what's going on anymore
Trixie is Canon, so she is better than Nyx. >_>
Ponies forget that Nyx was there in Creeping Darkness
other then I'm sataying here
Nyx = son of Trixie
You guys are gonna make me go on a Disney movie marathon. :/
sorrry for the confusion
No
OK, what is SW:APT?
Unfortunately, only a fraction of the people we normally have were here so I'm sure it'll happen later on
/me 11can sing pretty good, believe it or not.
Oh well, I'm not changing who I am
DISNEY MOVIES ARE AWESOME
12http://www.laptop-repair.info/repair_laptop_hinge.html?
/me 11fucking loves classic Disney
Disney was the shit
Nyx is a failed attempt to fully revive Nightmare Moon. They got a small, innocent child instead
11Was
Who grows up to be evil
disney WAS
*Thumbs up for Silverscreen
Who doesn't?
Okay well. Movies are done and it's almost 1am. I'm outtie.
why is making a fluttershy parody character for larp so hard?
Only people without souls don't love classic disney
But don't tell anypony
/me can sing quite well, too. Sings bass, which makes singing popular music hard.
Star Wars: Apartment? I don't know, that's my only guess.
dam Past Sins at the moment makes me sad
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vsQ9W6AYAqg/TjJfROuPvDI/AAAAAAAAJas/hOpHB5wfDJE/s1600/uprising_by_xfizzle-d41zi2d.jpg
Tenor
Same
I can sing pretty well.
6I'm done soon myself.
11They're slowly making a comback with Tangled and Princess and the Frog...but it's too slow.
SPIDERS WEB DOES NOT EXIST!
02I know that feeling Lyon
Likes that album cover
RandomExtra: Sounds like a Charolette's Web ripoff.
Anyone else thinks that modern mainstream music sucks
Yeah, used to sing well, too, can't anymore
6I'll put on one more vid and then Epic Sax Spike.
/me pwns nubs
I don't think Tangled was Disney.
12Dunno how reliable it is, but it does say how to fix a laptop hinge
@RandomExtra: Thanks
http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131164096441.png Trixie aint got nuttin on that
mostly because of goddamn neighbors
it was
I'm tired, and I'm gonna play a round of KF with some friends to unwind
11Tangled was disney.
6...also, it's almost a new month, which means new closing time music.
Such a beautiful song
I only listen to music you may have heard of, but probably not.
There we go.
SELF PROCLAIMED GENIUS
10iHeldAChicken, you think YOU pwn nubs?
there last fairy tale one
@Dee_Twenty: Tangled was Disney.
11...wasn't it?
YES!
I cant believe Disney is done with fairy tales after Tangled! They're doomed
Yusuke: Kinda, but man. Cee-Lo Green and Fuck You is a great song.
@Dashite_Alt: exactly what I've been doing. Just finished the sword in the stone, Bambi, and the rescuers. I've been watching the classics.
I DO!
D: No, I thought we were keeping epic sax spike?
Trixie has canon. She doesn't need anything else.
0indeed it was
why aren't you allowed to sing loudly in apartments?
lol
6Did we agree on that?
Bruno Mares isn't that bad, either.
8but...
ya Fuck You is good
im going to go watch Hercules now
8epic sax spike...
I fail to see how canon makes somepony automatically superior.
6I like Epic Sax Spike
Because you have people living next to you who are complete JERKS
Just because I can. Nyx originated in Creeping Darkness FanFic. Past Sins wanted to expand upon that OC.
Chiyo nice! :)
mainstream music is too manestream
11I would love to see them redo all their classics in Tangle's style. It's got that Disney feel all over it.
6I just thought we were gonna change it...
But..why?
I'mma sing where I want when I want
It disturbs others, RobotPinkie. Most apartment walls have less soundproofing than space has air.
I'm okay with that
hahahahahaha
6I honestly would prefer to keep Epic Sax Spike.
12Is your laptop your main computer?
Trixie is like, the worst pony in the series. Probably, without a doubt, my least favorite pony. I hate Trixie
alright, now do http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOZf1T0wKU&feature=related
DONT HURT ME NO MORE
Don't hurt me, no more
6Well, because at first we thought it would get old.
DON'T HURT MER
Tangled was great. *HEADBOBS*
yay
:/
books you lied.

its official: bronies got the best music on the internet.

*headbobs*
yes
6But, it didn't, it got... vintage.
I lied??
NO MORE
You said BYE
fuck,
YES
YES
NOOOOOOOOOO! Remakes almost ALWAYS suck an infinite amount of horse wangs!
/me is headbobbing
I already explained,
:D
oh
FUCK
OH LAWD
ya thats true
ith thoguht that was someone else
nevermindsorrylol
lol I know, I'm just annoyed because my neighbor sings all the time, and I have a much more powerful voice than that. :P
It's our trademark closing time/off the air thing
I apologized
Well
D:
The new remake
when do we do requests?
I love Trixie's Hammy bitchiness *HEadbobs*
6Yeah.
of Thundercats
Alright everyone. I am leaving. Thanks for a wonderful night.
Ok hi again! :D
is glorious
6It's good, imo.
what is this,love, thing he keeps mentioning?
it's amazing.
this
I plan on staying here to the last man.
is
Skips, Godfather of Soul
This song is an amazing example of the 90's
Bye, Sotha
WHAT IS LOVE?
BEAUTIFUL
I have no idea
Trixie's terrible
I'm slowly starting to hate this song
head bang
mlp is a show about femenism
6One thing I will be changing is the gif for Saturday preshows. I normally change it, but I'll be allowing it to reset every month.
Trixie is the fourth best pony.
wooaaahhh'
The fact that I stole her name clearly shows how much I hate her
lol
It's that other thing besides tolerance
Head bop
we need more Big Mac
MLP is a show about ponies.
6Since people LOVE the Gummy gif.
ftw
seventh best pony
after the mane 6
Silly, MLP is a show about masculinism!
11Dee_Twenty: I"m not talling about an all-out remake. I'm just saying they should do a 3-D rendering of their classic movies and put the original audio to it. It would work.
Nyx is best OC
best pony is madame le flour
Also, Trixie has a bitchin' wizard hat and cape.
Nyx is best OC
pfft, the turnips were better
I need to see if I can find a "Scoot- Scootaloo" ringtone for my new text message tone. After reading Pony Psychology.... I can't use Flutterrage.
she put on her robe and wizard hat
HAHAHA!
but the new coat could ruin the magiks they have
ghosties personally I cringed when you mentioned ponies 'going behind your back' cause now it sounds like I've tattled on them or some shit
no Sir Lints a Lot
YOU'RE GOING
TO
(Spoilers) Nyx turns Fluttershy into a tree
LOVE ME
NO!
And that's why she is best OC pony.
lol
NOOOOO
jose!
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.
jose!
6They went to YOU? Oo
SPOILED
Spike is the best pony
I like the part where they (spoiler) Twilight by the neck until death
6The NEW MOD?
The Game
Fluttershy liked being a tree.
jose! jose! jose!
Well, like I said, they should voice their concerns to ME
6TF IS THIS SHIT?
It was nice!
11I mean, they already make a shitload of money out of "digitally restoring" all the classics, so why not take it to the next level?
/me 11headbobs.
Owlicious is better
Pinkie inflation. This is my fetish. <3
If it's a problem about me, it should be voiced to me
can we at least do http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOZf1T0wKU&feature=related for tomorrow's play show if you're not doing it now?
tomorrow?
no gokaiger :(
Scootaloo will go to the Y Games and meet Pony Hawk where she will get her cutie mark
Rock My Pony [No BGM]
>>implying the fanbase wouldn't crucify disney if they remade classic movies
it wasn't specifically you though, it was the general mod feeling
02No
02It's her life
Characters doesn't have a k
I second Interior_gummy decision
probably because the 3d would screw with the 2d style of then, you would have to go in and redraw alot of stuff
there's direct to DVD sequels, and then there's that
Hoops is best pony
WF_Chronicles: This is so true.
it just makes me sound like I've dicked on them a bit >.>
they need to redo Mickey Mouse
And yeah, I'm pretty surprised they went to a new mod. But then, most of them probably were unaware that you were a new mod. That, OR, they noticed that you were pro for the film and sought refuge with you
>Implying Disney has much of a fanbase left at this point.
his old cartoons were good
11>> implying they'd be changed in any way outside of the visual style.
We need ponies and A Day to Remember.
that would mess with the style and change it ultimately
I'm gonna hit they hay, guys. I had fun. Goodbye.
Heh
12lol
o hai madden
lol Disney pretty much has the biggest fanbase in the world, still
john madden
Guten Nacht
LUUUL TROLLESTIA
John Madden!
I still love 80s Cheerilee
Zecora ftw
Wasn't it in the interview with the director of MLP that if they could they would make a 3D animated version of MLP movie but it would look 2D
Well, as far as I could tell, it was just me really vocalizing my opinion on the film
12I think all of our lives are our computeres XD
Pixar's fanbase doesn't count, they have their own style.
'80s Cheerilee needs her own episode.
the audi would probably be redone, you can only remaster so much ya know
i took a personality test and got zecora
they wouldn't reuse the old audio tracks, they'd use the new animation as an excuse to hire new voice actors
and then
like Street Fighter 4
they could just fuck with the movie
12computers*
6Speaking of which... I think it's promotion time, for both RBD and Sathi... agreed Ghosties and Hipster?
all they want.
Like spy kids 3
sell toys
I wanna have a Ghibli movie play here at some point.
ya me too Bash
yeah and as far as I could tell, someone complained to me because I was actively trying to promote people trying the film out for what it was worth :P
PLEASE http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOZf1T0wKU&feature=related

@Srake A lot of songs were slated to be put in, but many didn't fit, were hard to produce, or were scrapped in the end due to certain constraints. They had to pay massive royalties regardless.

See you in there
The Mighty and Courageous SilverMane has graciously decided to spare RainBroDash, for SilverMane understands that some, lesser ponies can not handle the tasks Silvermane besets upon them. SilverMane will learn from this. (lawl)
LIES. Cinderella... and the Beast

Ponies you say?

12i'm so bored that i'm playing a game that makes friday look good
Like a boss!

Night guys, or morning depending on where you are
Gaston kind of got jipped on his villain songs really, he just doesn't compare to the likes of Scar.
i love my trixie impersonation
Good morning and farewell.
Twilight Sparkle The Magnificent doesn't approve.
As soon as I saw it as the top recommended, I knew that was coming.
EAT A BAGEL
THE BOSS
LIKE A BAWS
Did I make this? I think I'd remember if I did.
10SilverMane. The Mighty and Courageous SilverMane. (I like it by the way ;D). I beseech thee to spare me for I am a lesser pony, and I am glad you understand this. Now, I must leave. BUT I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

I would sell my soul to keep the show going until I die.
12o-O

i was in my bed thinking about various deep quetions then MLP came up XD
02No, I'm laughing at my memorires of that game XD
I'd rather make MLP movies or games
JOHN MCCAIN
02Tbh that's what got me onto the interwebz
Hmm...
I would add my soul to the deal to make sure it stays good that long
0Books dont have souls tho...
6>implying I haven't stayed up for periods of time longer than anypony else here
6When I am tired, I am TIRED
I would sell my front cover for more ponies.
6I don't sleep unless I'm about to pass out.
lol
Lets just hold out for season 3 before anything else
lmao
maybe my first born sequal.
I know what you mean...BUT YOU MUST OUTLAST
season 3 is pretty much guarenteed
So I was asleep in my cool room, a single sheet on me and my fan on low.
6It's already been confirmed that there will be a season 3.
thats not healthy you know
12XD
~Yay~
6Ziltoid, I suffer from massive insomnia
6It happens
YOSH!!!!!!
I shifted and woke up slightly, but I didn't open my eyes.

Seriously?
oh sorry dint know
season 5 is guaranteed for me
6However, I walk everywhere, so it kinda balances out.
TWO MORE GLORIOUS YEARS OF PONY
take some of those pills in your bathroom cabinet... preferably with alcohol
6I walked 28 miles to a job site once.
6Was fun.
With my head pressed into my pillow I slowly began to dream.

0I WILL WALK 500 MILES

02wb
0Me* smile
I had those dreams where you feel awake and alive while still asleep.
6I walk the 7 miles to work every day, work either a 5 or 12 hour shift, and walk the 7 miles back.
0get yo grammar wright
6I love the excercise.
sorry it's dark, i can hardly see my keyboard.
and i'm tired. but thanks anyway.
I work as a cart wrangler. Pushing a few hundred pounds of carts for 6-8 hours a day 5 times a week in the summer is doing wonders
0im just being a tool
Good for you then
you can see your keyboard?
0dont mind me
thanks
12wb roara
I have a backlit keyboard :P
12!aurora
6I know how that goes ffffffffffffff
I believe it's called Lucid dreaming, but to me at the time I was just enjoying the experience.
Bye all. Time to go see what this "Past Sins" deal is.
6I did that for close to two years.
0i have 2 keyboards
cya Fox
today I got stung by a wasp though. shit sucked
0cuz im like that
wasps need to die
6I just drown out the pain.
I just type random keys and hope I can write coherent sentences
0Wasps eat tarantulas
0so they are good for somthin
lol i normally hate these kinda of songs but Weird Al made them all rite
6Then again I'm slighty (very) masochistic.
Tarantulas are fine.
Spiders are bros
0Spiderbro?
I began to dream about ponies as time on. I had strange feelings throughout my body.
Anything that flies and stings can burn in hell
fuck spiders, man.
woah mib lets not go there lol
0I hate insectoids
I had a pony dream.
They aren't venomous. And they are fuzzy and cute!
It turned into silent hill
/me yawns
the horror
the horror...
It was an intense feeling of happyness and relaxation.
12!shinywalk
ever saw those pics of human twilight sparkle dreaming of ponies then calling RD
0i had a pony dream
0pinkie killed things
i love tarantulas but hate smaller spiders
I will never forget, it almost had a comic feel to it.
i wish i had a pony dream
Needs some more Yakity Sax.
6I had the most amazing lucid pony dream after staying up for 116 hours.
0all and all its a great way to stay in shape
6FUKKEN AMAZING
As I could see scene by scene, this allowed me to look to the end.
man wat
>116 hours
Enlighten us
i must stay awake for 116 hours now
There gonna be anymore movies?
with ponies,
sleep to pony music
ohshitniggerwhatareyoudoing.jpg
and then crash
6I'm pretty sure I couldn't enlighten you.
Try me
next vid?
are you secretly Pinkie Pie?
DEATH NOTE!!
any1 ever read The Art of War
6It was the timespan of like, three weeks in pony time.
Go on
MLP VS DEATH NOTE
I think Angry Pony Polka is better than the first one, personally.
I saw the last part of my dream. It had Luna in it. She was talking to me. She told me that it was time to wake up.
dat buffer
FFFFFFFFFFFFFF
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
what is this.
0FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
trollface.jpg
As I was reading/experiencing the words I slowly began to stir. I woke up with a bit of a start.
ಠ_ಠ
6Sexy Naughty Bitchy Rarity
Of course, I just like Angry White Boy Polka.
0OH MY LORD
Oh wow
>reading in a dream
how
0i cant get this song out of my head
It looked like a comic.
0thanks for refreshing it
I found experience sounds and see like I was a floating ghost.
I don't remember much of the dream.
But I will never forget those last words.
I had a dream turn into a nightmare because of the general inability to read in a dream.
6I rarely remember most of my dreams, especially the lucid ones.
same problem here, sir
any lucid dream I have is life-like. But as soon as I try to reach out with my mind to alter it I wake up. shit sucks
Maybe i had and wasted a pony dream. D:
I had a dream that felt like years past by. I got married, Japan was attacked by North Korea and China
Of course, normally when I try to read in a dream, I open my actual eyes (not my dreamself eyes). Because I suddenly feel my eyes being closed.
!shinywalk
Whenever I seem to have dreams, whatever I dream ends up happening...no lie.
I fought them then I was saved by U.S. Army stationed in japan
I'll give you some advice if you want to Lucid dream.
6Denied, precognitive dreams are not uncommon.
It's hard, and random for me. But your best bet is if you wake up calmly. Just keep your eyes closed. That's so important.
6I get them a lot.
My dreams tend to start with boring day-to-day stuff, transitioning to jRPG-scale adventures.
Like going down an elevator in a grocery store to fight a dragon.
Yep I have prophetic dreams occasionally, freaks me out
one time i was a samurai (kinda) wanderin around the Philippines fighting corruption in local areas
I don't have prophetic ones, but damn I get some crazy ones that are full of more adventure then a week long Final Fantasy Binge
Naturally
Dreams are always crazy random and unpredictable... trapped within my body... and keep waking up without actually waking up
would it be alright if you guys watch my PMV?
My dreams are usually me starting somewhere mundane when all of the sudden i'm LEAPING OUT OF THE 9TH FLOOR OF MY DORM BECAUSE ZOMBIE VIRUS IS INFECTING EVERYTHING NOW i HAVE TO RUN 800 MILES TO NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE ARK SHIPS ARE GOING TO TAKE US INTO OUTERSPACE AND then I wake up.
Will we burn our eyes and beg for release of the horrid memory if we watch it?
6My precognitive dreams span time spans of MONTHS or even YEARS before happening exactly as they happened in the dream.
Hey brones
Bak again
RainbowDoubleDash good thing we're watching inception then eh?
lol no
sup brony
0Bronies*
My fucking connection is crazy
INCEPTION
BWOOOOOOOON
GO DEEPER
That was probably my most vivid pony dream.
I don't have precognitive dreams. I have flashes of precognition.
does any1 ever wish every1 would stop arguing about stuff like the existance of God and just mind their own business
3gently, please
While I'm awake.
3d'oh
I've had a few others. I recall "having" them but no memory of what happened.
also there's an invisible demon in my closet... you know the usual
0no colors for you
Only that I was generally incredibly at peace after them.
6Yusuke, I know that feel
"We couldn't fit it all in."
6Yeah, TTG, colors are for mods only
Everythin would b better if we all just act good, doesnt matter wat one belives in religious wise
My opinion on God is, we won't know the answer until we close out eyes for good, so just live.
pretty.
our'
yet to have a pony related dream... only boring human dreams
Luna > Nyx > Twilight > Trixie
Aint no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
Reading lots upon lots of Luna fiction.
Money does grow on trees
Who the fuck is Nyx?
dem g1 ponies
a fan cahracters
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed. Ain't nothin in this world for free
Nyx is an oc character
The Pony Polka creator definitely ships AppleDash
0read Past Sins
non plural
Nyx is an OC Pony from Creeping Darkness.
I'm okay with appledash.
Then Past Sins took the Character and expanded it.
And also sins of the past
just saying.
0oh, really
0didn't know that
Solution to debt problems... print more money /trollface
arrrgh all this talk of Fanfiction is reminding me I need to finish part 6 of mine...

0She's less an OC and more a alternate character depiction
I need to check ED
What exactly is a renegade of funk?
0but she's kind of OCy
That's probably why she works so much.

Obama is a cool guy eh... he kills terrorists and doesn't afraid of anything
TTG: One of my friends can put that to the test. He plays MtG and the WoW CCG professionally.
Did I just get obama rolled?

Yes.

(Seriously, they claim their credits transfer, when you might get 1 or 2 classes from 3 years of work transfered)
