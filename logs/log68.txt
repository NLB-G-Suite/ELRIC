because the mods led the viewers into a collaborative hate on his favourite genre
I won't deny that the mods have some amount of influence to the regular viewers, but if you think I'm going to just keep quiet because some people get upset that I can't tolerate this film, then that's completely unfair.

/me MOVIE BACKGROUND: Prudence is an archetype for beaten women and the way society glossed over their existence for awhile. She is a lesbian and her last relationship with a man ended rather badly.
However
yes why don't we do it in the room?
i can'ts stand this noise!
SHE ALREADY IS!
Hey, he's got Janice Joplin and Jimi Hendrix
Not smoking before the 2000s.... NOT COOL
WAAHAHPOOO!

No other phrase for it.
Ge didn't see the lights had changed
@Denied_Existence that's musicals for ya. Yes, the beds were arranged like a revolving gun, hence the spinning, and the song is "Happiness is a Warm Gun" to further prove this point
03LOL

@Denied_Existence he borrows from the influence of psychadelic drugs a lot, I wouldn't be surprised if he hadn't had some before
They're not being violent. They're fighting violence... with violence
03LOL @ Kelso
D:
Back to the beginning
But yeah
As seen in the opening

Okay guys
4Oh shit, no mod colors
4Anyways
12hmm
11That was...interesting.
11Just...interesting.
03LOL
4He picked the film, and I don't want him to think that I am chastising or ostracizing him for the film that he picked. I have absolutely no beef or qualm with him at all.
03"Thanks a lot for helping me look for Carla" "No problem I'll check the dumpster"
4That said
13You leik chocolate milk?
12night all~
4I've been told that a few people on here were voicing their concerns about me to other mods, and I would be very appreciative if you would say it to me in a PM.
Nii
:)
4Furthermore, it's my right to voice my opinion on a film
4As it is yours
11anyone else in the mood for tacos now?
11just as I was alright with people giving their opinion about my Random Movie Trivia :P
4I may have upset a few people, but they should understand that in now way should my opinion sway that of others. I may be a mod, but I'm also a regular person too
03"you might find out the very same thing you hate is the thing you'll end up missing when it's gone"
03Nah, I won't hate apple if they go out of business
8see ya tomorrow sathi
4So, EVERYBODY has the right to complain.
8 /today
4And yes
4I hated this film
11This movie was....really fucking weird.
4I just fucking HATE musicals
11That's the only conclusion I have for it.
6Hear that everypony? If you get picked in the lotto, pick a musical.
11I mean, half the songs were good, half of them were shit. The story's hard to follow if you don't know US history that well.
7Im just glad we had someone giving background information..
4It was my OPINION
4Got it?
11and the style was ALL over the place.
11just...just fucking weird.
11Not good. Not bad. Just weird.
4Like I said, I didn't kick any of you guys when you bitched about my movie choice a few months ago
/me 10liked it
4Thank you
4And I hope you enjoyed the film
4And Bruce Campbell
02hey
4Cause he's awesome
6That said, we welcome any and all kinds of movies, as changes of pace are good. Just as long as they're... movies and not SW:APT

02You're Uralooser right?

It just supposed to be thought-provoking.
Cast Away!
I'll give Inception a fair shot, but comparing it to the Matrix is not a good way to eliminate my apprehensions.

I just type random keys and hope I can write coherent sentences
0Wasps eat tarantulas

6Then again I'm slighty (very) masochistic.
Tarantulas are fine.
Spiders are bros

Oh wow
>reading in a dream
how
0i cant get this song out of my head
It looked like a comic.
0thanks for refreshing it
I don't remember much of the dream.
Maybe i had and wasted a pony dream. D:
I had a dream that felt like years past by. I got married, Japan was attacked by North Korea and China
Of course, normally when I try to read in a dream, I open my actual eyes (not my dreamself eyes). Because I suddenly feel my eyes being closed.
!shinywalk
Whenever I seem to have dreams, whatever I dream ends up happening...no lie.
I fought them then I was saved by U.S. Army stationed in japan
6Denied, precognitive dreams are not uncommon.
6I get them a lot.
Yep I have prophetic dreams occasionally, freaks me out
Naturally
Dreams are always crazy random and unpredictable... trapped within my body... and keep waking up without actually waking up
6My precognitive dreams span time spans of MONTHS or even YEARS before happening exactly as they happened in the dream.
Hey brones

RainbowDoubleDash good thing we're watching inception then eh?
