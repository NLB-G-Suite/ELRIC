no.
Aww...
12night all
12v-v
Cya.
if it was an accident then they're not necessarily a bad person
and it was their choice and they have to deal with it
I tried it, the cat didn't care.
if they're guilty, then they acknowledge that they're a "bad person"
if not, then they aren't, at least in their own eyes
heh

You need to grow an awesome mustache
Haha.

>implying I CAN grow an awesome mustache
I'm practically a girl.

Girls don't get asked for ID. :P

I have too much facial hair. For being 15 anyway. I don't want to shave, it's boring!
One of the people my sister met had me drinking a mixture of gin and champagne.

My physics teacher walked in on three of us physics students sipping gin from a hip flask in the toilets at our prom because it was 4:25 for a pint. The lad asks for some of it.
I like limoncello.

SMF has a security exploit up to version 1.1.16
Whats that?
It's an attachment exploit
allows someone to upload a remote access file to the server
and also, when you're logged on the forums
I know
lol
I spent ages trying to remove that XD
XD
but yeah
I just left it in the end but I should have another go ..
the exploit is the main thing
Well, it looks like PHP isn't parsing the tag correctly
It's because I deleted the mod
Manually...
well, it has to be in the code somewhere
rofl
don't worry, I'm lazier
well heh, have fun
I'm more worried about the exploit which means I need to update
yeh but 1.1.16 isnt out is it?
dunno
http://www.devside.net/blog/smf-exploit-like-phpbb-hack
it's that one
which doesn't give info on it though
1.1.14 is the latest in the 1.1.x series.

When does the stream usually go on?
not sure
11Stream starts @ 2PM Eastern Standard Time
8PM for my time zone then
11Yes.
how much RAM is required?
06Not really sure, I think it's a bit cpu-intensive at times though. I do not know the exact figures >-<
let me look :P
lowest is around 550MB
i advise 1GB
11Danke
now poof again
I'm more concerned about RAM
CPU I have no problems with
well
I have more than that
11Yesterday was.

11:D*
A PART-
yeah
I have a few servers though

Is 'Independence Day' shown today, or is that Sunday's?
7Well, at least you're downloading that much faster than my computer. :P
it's on a server with a 100mbps connection
or supposed to have one
One of the highschools here were throwing out server racks :p
Or UPS units
is there anything I need to do after running/installing it?
7I think you need to configure some settings or somewhat.
and are there different "lands" or something?
7Maps?
7Yeah, if you want to set up a certain rotation.
I don't know anything :p
7Lol.
wat
^ Wat^2
65%
this might go until 2:30
7As I said, feel free to sleep at any time.
I don't want to leave it running
because it means I have to leave my laptop on
06I would help with the config and such but I'm rather busy >-<
and if there's configuration required at the end of the ./steam download
then I'm screwed
I have photographed said extreme cuteness, which I have finally gotten off my memory card: http://upload.cetafurs.com/100_0926.jpg :P
Is there a showtime list somewhere?

Got 44 on the quiz.
FORGIVE THIS BLAS-FEMUR'S BAD PUNS
4The hardest area for me was the joke names Spike gave the victims of the poison
4I only got one of those right
I got 3 of those
11Appletini
The jokes were easy for me
11Twilight Flopple
4Flutterguy
When did Spike give a name to Twilight?
Comedy!
4That was it
11Hairity
6...those are easy.
11Flutterguy
Dash appearance makes this episode 20% cooler
6Spitty Pie
I can not remember him calling her Twilight Flopple
11Spitty Pie
I got all of them, but the instruments had me stumped
4In fact, I bet I've only watched it one time
I got a 45/60. I am unworthy ;_;
6Let's see if I can fix this for reals...
11KICK-ASS IS NEXT!
4I got the instruments easy
He called her Twilight Flopple as an aside while they were leaving for the forest.

4Jesus
Also I type in spike as a pet, but the quiz scolded me for lt
Manehattan has a specifiv spelling
oh, sound!
I got Tuba, and a bunch of others that had asterisks ;_;
11There we go.
4I missed it simply because I misspelled Manehatt*a*n

Those guys are boring.
03I generally don't like live performances
5With the TWELVE STRING BASS
8SPIDERMAN DERAIL
5and the FIVE NECK GUITAR
Yeah, Kick-Ass 2 is coming in 2012
5D:

4One of the main character's friends becomes a "hero?"
03but even then, I prefer the album tracks
4God
He becomes an hero
03I saw Trans-Siberian Orchestra live and was like meh, I'll stick to the CDs
4I don't think I would watch the second one
They stole my comics!

*playing gay
@rellek hnnnnnnnggg
PRETEND TO BE GAY, STILL GET TO RUB DOWN NAKED CHICKS
but men singing high is yucky D:
I'm looking to see if I can get a band going with some friends, actually.
no u
still?
8sometimes i wish i were gay...
HNNNNNNNNNNNG
like... gay, but also straight...
I pull off gay really well.
Aaaaaaaaw shit, son
5LL, unless they can actually pull it off and sound good, like Lee used to be able to.
4Huh, I see
h8rz be h8in
Should I mimic Whelp and bring up the kinsley scale?
still as in most times pretending to be gay wouldn't help get into people's pants
Fact: Girls don't really do this with their friends, unless they play for the other team
No seriously. That fic was brilliant.
5Jon Anderson is another one that sounded pretty good singing high. (of Yes)
o.o
how high?

4Hah
5I don't know, Anderson sounded pretty legit in some of those songs. But maybe he was just really good at falsetto. /shrug
4It's good, isn't it?
11Yes, it is.
Ooh! We should watch that sometime. Maybe. If we haven't already.
4You know, I wouldn't mind watching that in the BMN at some point
