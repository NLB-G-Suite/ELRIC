/me is getting annoyed.
/me hides
03what is it with everyone and getting randomly pissed off
03I swear I don't get people
people are human
you know?
03so?
humans make mistakes
they get upset by feelings
they do things that they shouldn't do
and when they've done it, they realise that they shouldn't
/me is rather emotional, too XP
and sometimes it's too late to go back to what they had

I guess you would call it "regret"
I haven't regretted anything for ages

You're not annoying...
No. Everyone says i am.
You're not always annoying
But half the time you are
But, you aren't...
03at least I admit to being annoyed

So? you run one at least
it was a fluke that i got 64 listeners the day before my birthday
and that doesn't relate to you being cool or not
chances can happen again
*sigh* i just dont know myself half the time
Then try to understand
I am
Very slowly
once you understand you learn how to cope
and realise who you fully are
12O.o
you alone can define who you are
12wtfish?
no one else's opinions matter in that sense
ask yourself this question: Who am I?
Long story LL, cbf'd explaining atm
scroll up, derp
ive asked myself that everyday in my head
What is your answer?
/me hides
:P
thats not what she meant
*sigh* ill find my answer in time.
lmao
Look, lol
i know :P
one moment
ok.
"I am a being who has a path laid out but yet to walk it, to choose between the forking paths, between the darkness of the unknown and the paths already taken. I am overshadowed and ignored by many, but I can know and see, and that is enough. "
/me 12o.o
"I am free to choose my path, but I am yet to stray off it, in fear of the unknown and the shadows that follow behind. I am someone who has been perceived in many different ways by those around me, but those perceptions are not my own. "
/me 12decides to stay out of it
"They only know what they can see, not what I feel, know or believe."
Can you understand that?
Yes.
Then make up your own
ok.
Look not at the result, but at the process
Only your perception and opinion matters
just remember that
only you know who you are and what you feel
yeah.
and lol, you need to stop caring about what I say :p
Way to make the internet serious guys. That's not fun at all. :P

Doing work is more boring than doing nothing if procrastination has taught me anything.
I'd watch the universe grow from the big bang to now
lmao true
Lawl.

an*
nah
an ant having an adventure would be okay

Does that make me a bad person?
lmao
no.
Aww...
it makes who threw the cat a bad person
12night all
12v-v
Cya.
I remember my uncle picked a up cat by the tail and neck before, strangely it didn't seem to mind.
and it was their choice and they have to deal with it
I tried it, the cat didn't care.
if they're guilty, then they acknowledge that they're a "bad person"
if not, then they aren't, at least in their own eyes
heh
Back.
remember you're talking to a person who has very f*cked up morals and philosophies :p

Hi :3
2Hello. :3
/me loves Pokemon White
Put piece of glass in mouth for 5 hours, handle glass for 20 minutes, cut self. HOW DO?
/me has no Pokemon games anymore :(
Aw :C
Wasn't even sharp, it was just a little mirror thing.
2I like them both for the fact that during the cutscenes with Reshiram/Zekrom, their cries are lengthy and drawn out.
I COULD always buy one on VC
but meh
/me just likes the characters X3
2Still, I'm curious if there's going to be a new game that goes into the backstory of Kyurem. O_o
There might be.
Kyurem is underloved.
2I hope so. I like Kyurem as much as the other two. :3
It's actually kind of cute X3
/me is confuzzled about Pokemon games X3
2Since my Pokemon White is the game I play without using my Pokemon from previous games, I'm going to start with Tepig and have Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem in my game early on.
I'm a too big of a Mario & Sonic fan XD
X3
to understand pokemon i mean
I'm working on training my old buddies from SoulSilver.
Charzy's at the top of the list right now.

Yeah, it was my favorite battle theme.

2Team Plasma's battle theme is better than Team Galactic's with Team Magma/Aqua's battle theme being in second place.

We already kinda celebrated it at midnight, but just thought you might wanna know, you know
Oh, thanks a lot RainBroDash.
np dude
Hah, my mum reminded me that my birthday's in 5 (4 now, flight went through the night) days, I hadn't even realised to was so close. Damn you time for moving so fast. XD
oh crap D:
mind me asking how old you'll be mr dari? :P
I'll be 16 then.
awesome
tis a good year hehe
Damn you for being older than me
Haha, my body is not ready for more parties.
standard, i just had my leavers prom and afterparty and stuff (I've just finished year 13) and I went through the pictures of the afterparty, there's a couple pictures of me raping at Street Fighter 2 arcade at the afterparty
I wish Hipster was a bit faster with his e-mail sendong
Bloody great game drunk
sending*
Man lack of sleep is not good for my typing
hah, i know right
bleugh
The alcohol at the place we were staying was free, which wasn't so good for me. XD
oh lawdy
did you get an adults wristband i guess? ;)
They were pretty relaxed about asking for ID.
sick
My sister and parents ordered most of my drinks for me though.
last night (10 months after my 18 birthday) was the first night I distinctly remember not being ID'd
looking like I'm 12 ftw
not last night, bleugh, i mean wednesday night
You need to grow an awesome mustache
Haha.
and never get asked for ID again
>implying I CAN grow an awesome mustache
I'm practically a girl.
(in terms of facial hair, not man-parts O_O)
Girls don't get asked for ID. :P
x
xD*
I have too much facial hair. For being 15 anyway. I don't want to shave, it's boring!
One of the people my sister met had me drinking a mixture of gin and champagne.
pahahaha
It actually taste alright. O_o
that is a king combo i will say right now
tastes*
I love champagne
well, I like wine
therefore I like champagne too
My physics teacher walked in on three of us physics students sipping gin from a hip flask in the toilets at our prom because it was 4:25 for a pint. The lad asks for some of it.
I like limoncello.
LOL
I love my physics teacher
Nice teacher.
best teacher too
My physics teacher is srs business. Nobody dares to misbehave during his classes
Unlike every other class
ever
Especially german
hah
One of my class mates taped the door handle, so the teacher couldn't get in
suddenly principal
Oh yeah, it's a good idea to mention one of my other school mates got taped to a chair that class too
principal + taped door handle + student taped to chair = no fun
Lol.
ah :D
fuck. just went to turn on my xbox to play some cod
forgot it RRoD'd last night...
WOOOOOOOOO
I don't have an xbox
I have a PS3 though
too cheap to buy any games
So I only have about 5
I literally own two Xbox game discs
they're both CoD...
I don't have any CoD games. I have Gran turismo 5, GTA4, GTA4 liberty city stories, the orange box, NFS:Hot pursuit and Little big planet 2
NFS: Hot Pursuit
that's a classic right there
okay, that's 7 games, but I suppose GTA4 and liberty city stories counts as one
It's a really fun game. I liked the original, I liked the PS2 game, but this one is the best
online play ftw
I was referring to the original :P
Yeah, I figured
:D
I just thought I'd make sure you know I'm not referring to the original
ah alrighty :P
I mostly play Gran turismo 5
It was the first game I got too
as a PS3 + GT5 bundle
fair
on release date too
this Xbox was an original 360, release date one
doesn't even have an HDMI port
oh
You going to get a new one?
it lasted 6 years... those things had a fail rate of like 50%
i dont know
it's DEFINITELY not under warrantly
warranty
lol, yeah I suppose not
Hey, do you know the show Allo Allo?

SMF has a security exploit up to version 1.1.16
Whats that?
I mean, what exploit?
It's an attachment exploit
allows someone to upload a remote access file to the server
and also, when you're logged on the forums
this shows under the quick login bit at the top
"Login with username, password and session length show_facebook(); "
I know
lol
I spent ages trying to remove that XD
XD
but yeah
I just left it in the end but I should have another go ..
the exploit is the main thing
Well, it looks like PHP isn't parsing the tag correctly
It's because I deleted the mod
Ah
Manually...
well, it has to be in the code somewhere
There'll be some file I forgot.. trouble is I can't be botehred looking
rofl
don't worry, I'm lazier
well heh, have fun
I'm more worried about the exploit which means I need to update
yeh but 1.1.16 isnt out is it?
Also yay for shared hosting, my host will definitely have some way to combat that if it does happen to ours
dunno
http://www.devside.net/blog/smf-exploit-like-phpbb-hack
it's that one
which doesn't give info on it though
1.1.14 is the latest in the 1.1.x series.
http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=272393.0
Ah right
oh, derp. well, that's the latest that's available on their download page, at least, from what i can tell.
derp
1.1.17 seems to be out
unless they changed that
I don't use the 1.1.x series, so I'm out of the loop on that one. I'm using 2.0 RC4 now, and testing out 2.0 final.
ah it's 1.1.6/7
not 1.1.1x
well
we both misread. xD
I prefer 2.0 RC2
or well, RC3
damn, Drake poofed

Also, hi Silver
11Hello.
11Do you like Apples?
I like apple pie
I prefer other fruits though
06I'd like to see if anything I can get going would be stable, but it wouldn't be a "proper" one that's up all the time and all >->
like watermelons
7Eh, sure.
and strawberries

12silly goon
12what else
06Lol
hello everyone I just recently joined the herd how's it going?
uh
what OS is required?
7For the game?
fine
7PC or Mac. o.O
the server
linux?
waiting patiently for the re stream
06lol
7I dunno. :P
/me 7checks the wiki.
if it's linux then I'm perfectly fine with it
I could do windows
as well, but I don't have as many windows servers
7Either windows or linux can work.
awesome
link?
7http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Linux_dedicated_server
When does the stream usually go on?
not sure
11Stream starts @ 2PM Eastern Standard Time
8PM for my time zone then
11Yes.
Oh, silver. Happy birthday. :)
how much RAM is required?
06Not really sure, I think it's a bit cpu-intensive at times though. I do not know the exact figures >-<
let me look :P
lowest is around 550MB
i advise 1GB
11Danke
now poof again
I'm more concerned about RAM
CPU I have no problems with
061gb seems to be popping up in many forums where people ask so it might be a well-tested value
It's your birthday, Silver?
well
I have more than that
you know what this calls for?
11Yesterday was.
06Well duh
but the remaining RAM
11A PARTY?! :d
11:D*
is like, 40-51mb :X
A PART-
yeah
I have a few servers though
11I win. :P
just checking around
:)
total used free shared buffers cached

should that be enough?
otherwise I'll shove it onto Altair's server

Hm
I have an idea
total used free shared buffers cached
hi dsd
Mem: 4096 112 3983 0 0 0

One of the highschools here were throwing out server racks :p
Big old rusty things
Or UPS units
is there anything I need to do after running/installing it?

and are there different "lands" or something?
7Maps?
7Yeah, if you want to set up a certain rotation.
I don't know anything :p

7I don't know how to configure server options, but if you'd like a map rotation, have it primarily CP with a small dose of CTF and PL.
wat
^ Wat^2
7Abbreviations for different map/game modes. o3o
65%
I'm getting tired
this might go until 2:30
7As I said, feel free to sleep at any time.
I don't want to leave it running
because it means I have to leave my laptop on
I had some retrocomputing stuff to do yesterday (copying a hard disk and box of 8" floppy diskettes). However, my plans were delayed due to extreme cuteness.
06I would help with the config and such but I'm rather busy >-<
and if there's configuration required at the end of the ./steam download
then I'm screwed
I have photographed said extreme cuteness, which I have finally gotten off my memory card: http://upload.cetafurs.com/100_0926.jpg :P
Is there a showtime list somewhere?
aww
actually
Xeli
do you want to shutdown my laptop when it's done?
Independence Day is today
Saving Private Ryan is tomorrow
06you can wait until tomorrow or something, lol
I'm looking to watching Kick-Ass another time. I ****ing loved that movie.
I hate leaving my laptop on though >:

8Silver, was that you who said your power went out or somepony else?
6I've been looping the Portal 2 OST for a very very long time lol

7 50? O.o
6yes
/me 11is watching NSync to get rid of the taste of being BeiberRoll'd by his own Youtube account.
6unless you got the official one lol
7Yep.
6cuz apparently they're missing a crapton of songs
7Well, 2/3.
8BUT WHY?
6including "Reconstructing Science" >.>
7It's in there, I think.
11Because NSync is still better than that shit.
6oh good cuz that song is legit
8why would you put yourself through more torture?
7Is it that one that was in the Potato ARG in the BitTrip section?
11It's less torture than Beiber
11At least NSync songs are bearable.
6in english?
11I rather hear Bye Bye Bye over BABY BABY BABY
Why not just listen to something good?
Just a thought...

Hey man

So does independence day start at 8PM est?
Yes, yes I did
8yes, dman
Oh thanks Hipster_Brony
That's 6 hours 40 minutes away? That's a long time
suck it up dman :P
I got my Physics book right here to...do stuff while I wait ; )
:D
/me drowns.
I'm just relaxing and watching a few LPs.
...maybe I should do something that doesn't involve the computer
Afternoon gaiz
Seeing as I'll be staring at this monitor for four hours straight once the event starts :I
Afternoon
/me has already died a chocolatey death.
According to my mirror my eyes are about to turn red.
I'll just relax with some piano for the next half hour, then.
Ouch :(
I'll see you people once the thing starts
Turning off the monitor.
Piano : D
/me dies again because his lungs are filled with chocolate.
/me would like some chocolate, but prefers her chocolate not inside someone's internal organs.
It's just that some of that movie's gags don't work quite the same way with them on
yeah they were stuck in the vid file
:/
Ah, thought so.
No problem, just wondering.
although with the magique of .mkv files... : P
/me was thrown into a river of chocolate.
...If anyone knows what I'm on about
it gave it a new dimension of humour at points, for some who've seen it multiple times
:D
Hey, when did RBD get here? Hey RBD
I suppose so : )
Or Dman...
it's apokalipse again hai!
hey Dman

*flashback episode idea*
D:
I don't know why but I tolerate that annoying pony a lot more than before.
But silverscreen you gotta be here : (
Does anyone realize that the cutiemarks are quite ambiguous in meaning?
You so funny, http://i.imgur.com/MhSERh.png
poor applebloom :(
lol, did you guys decide you didn't get enough ponies last night? :)
You were supposed to eat it if caught Apple Bloom!
nope
I'm playing Mortal Kombat at the same time. Beating Shao Kahn on Expert? Challenge Accepted
Color-swapped Scootaloo in that class o_o
There's something I've never gotten: Why was Twist laughing?
I didn't get any pony last night :I
maxaminusone... yeah pretty much
And Color-swapped Sweetie Belle
4Hey, I was getting ready to post in that screencap :D
yup
Twist is just a happy pony?
11I crashed my Mibbit posting that. XD
Twist bounce?
She's a two-faced bitch, that's what she is
11THEY'LL MAKE YOU THMIIIIILE!
For example the teacher could have been florist bc of the flowers.
DragonRage: Sometimes you just have to admit a joke is funny even if it's at a friend's expense
Lol, Ghosties I have about 15 good screencaps hiar: http://imgur.com/a/pBnx8
6Mibbit cannot handle all they NYAN
Needs more Twist
Or she's a Scootaloo and is afraid of what Tiara would think if she didn't laugh
11Agreed, Sol.
Including NOT THE BEES, that was funny too
Shame, I've been meaning to watch Deathstalker 2 but I probably won't be able to attend the next BMN
Bitch ponies.
6Twist's "just look at all the shits I give" face. XD
eeeeyup
Wait what does their cutie marks even represent?
yfw Sapphire Shores has no cutie mark
But the teacher chose to make it mean that she's supposed to help students "bloom".
8NAO
A silver spoon...?
Their destiny/personality
what nao hipster?
hahaha the 'MUAAHAHAHA' screencap is AMAZING
Nao what?
11♪Don't care how, ah want mine nao♫
ooh shiny fur
Strangest Mark I've seen in this show; 2 Dolphins swimming in a Circle. ~ didn't know what to make of that.
Means they're good at being spoiled stepford wives.
MuAHAHAHAHA ONE HUNDRED BILLION
/me catches Umbreon
:3
*ssh*
12;-;
11"Shh, I'm trying to hear the Apples
Silverscreen: Yay! I'm not alone in thinking of that song!
6APPLES
Pie!
I see dead apples
APPLES
APPLES
The apples tell me to kill Silver Spoon.
06is it really that easy
Were the Oranges family also the last ones in their class?
Mark! Mark! Mark!
nah
;p
Horse apples
11There's a leprechaun in mah applefield
The apples they speak to me... they understand me
10Ohai SS
tennus
Same with rarity. Her cutiemark is gems. So it makes sense that she should be miner. But she chose to be tailor.
Aggressive marketing comign up!
11He tells me to buuurrn things.
wat
Apple art?
Ohai Sky
SHE DESTROYED THAT PAINTING
that pony's cutie mark is the same astwilights...
omg its teh doctor
it was so beautiful
WHOOVES
dr whooves
Woctor Whooves!
that artist pony had twilights...
there was no painting
Cutie Marks are more symbolic than literal, imo
And then The Doctor was terrified by a little girl.
11Applebloom: She intimidates time lords.
yup
Dr. Whoof doesn't want apples?
BACK TO THE TARDIS
4Wow, Dman, you certainly screencapped a lot
shes like a little donna nobel
HE HATES PEARS
Sol, yes. They make them fit with what they want to do.
?!?!?!?!
?!?!?!?!?!
Dr Whoof has apples :P
4...are you screencapping every stream?
11lol
Thank ya, Ghosties
QUESTIONMARKEXCLAMATIONPOINT
Berry Punch!
If they were literal then Pinkie would love balloons more than partying.
And Yes, but I try to clear some up so as to only post the 'good' ones
Wait
Bonbon!
dat face
8they have credit cards in Equestria?
Credit?
LIES
Bon Bon@
I mentioned this in that interview a coupl'a days ago Hipster_Brony >_<
Sounds like it Hipster
Where's Lyra?
Hipster: A PONY..... CREDIT CARD?!?!?!
Also, only 4 bits for all those apples?
umad? Gimme all your apples
11Applebloom sounds a lot like the girls that worked at the gap in my home town.
man bon bons kinda mean
Calling the cops on you lady!
*takes whole cart*
4Dman
Those apples are for Lyra silly
4didn't answer my question
YOU'RE FIRED!
Equestrian Express...
Um...the ones I can : D
4Oh, I see
Doodlemood, yes. But everyone in this series makes it sound like they dictate your destiny.
So this one today yes, but I need to leave at some point for about 30 mins to tidy my house
6He used all of the testosterone in Equestria to grow that mustache.
why did they make twist autistic assburgers
indeed he did
11lol
What about that stasche?
nice
8royal tenanbaums pony
11What a "Twist".
i kinda want a stash like that
DUNNNNN
WHAT A TWIST
Le gasp
Apple Bloom DOES NOT WANT
Me gusta!
I don't see why applebloom cares about showing up to the party so much
8Twist's special talent is diabetes
4At Silverscreen: *slow clap*
RBD I see what u did there
like a stereotype nerd
6That was an M. Night level plot twist right there...
And then Twist was never again
Styling on you, Apple Bloom.
Someone gotta start a credit card compagny called Equestrian Express...
Oh man was I glad they did not decide to make Twist that big character...
Isn't it sad, Twist?
<:C
daaaaaw
Dawwwww
Dat face :(
dawwwwd
8Dermathil: all my money
yay rainbow dash
You so silly, Rainbow Dash.

Evil magic, Twilight.
12they're so irratating

This looks cake
12who's idea was it to make audio auto playing ads >:/
These animators cheat so hard sometimes. Scootaloo just walked into her helmet.
I cheated with the voice actors and looked at the episode credits XD
13I hate when I have multiple tabs open and an ad on one of them decides to start talking
13so I have to search for the right tab to stop it playing ;;
Cheating is magic
;p
12I am SOOOOOOOOOO gutted today :( I got lost in a TV series and missed the chance to buy 140+ prismacolor markers for only £80 ><
there have been youtube mashups of the animation mistakes, all in good fun
12They're usually £200+ :/
12I hate it when I'm listening to a song and it interrupts
like the cyclops in At the Gala

Kick-Ass
http://www.sporcle.com/games/pumpkinking0192/fim-countdown is a quiz posted on ED earlier this week
Got 44 on the quiz.
FORGIVE THIS BLAS-FEMUR'S BAD PUNS
I don't want to watch kick-ass with all the lag, but it'll do
4The hardest area for me was the joke names Spike gave the victims of the poison
4I only got one of those right
I got 3 of those
what one?
11Appletini
The jokes were easy for me
11Twilight Flopple
4Flutterguy
When did Spike give a name to Twilight?
Comedy!
4That was it
11Hairity
6...those are easy.
11Flutterguy
Dash appearance makes this episode 20% cooler
Rainbow Crash
Appletini, Spitty Pie, and Flutterguy
6Spitty Pie
I can not remember him calling her Twilight Flopple
4I haven't watched Bridle Gossip in forever
11Spitty Pie
I got all of them, but the instruments had me stumped
Did he do so later in the episode?
oh and Rainbow Crash, so 4?
4In fact, I bet I've only watched it one time
I got a 45/60. I am unworthy ;_;
6Let's see if I can fix this for reals...
11KICK-ASS IS NEXT!
Hairity
4I got the instruments easy
He called her Twilight Flopple as an aside while they were leaving for the forest.

My mom died right in front of me, oh well
03yeah, the only Cheap Trick song I like is Mighty Wings
Sorry, no weather available for your location, please try !weather zipcode/city,country
I love this movie.
anyone read Kick Ass 2?
10lolol
11Ghosties: HE's a brony. How can you hate him?
8regular fist fights: lots of those
There was a food fight at mine, I wasn't there though >:
nope
03and I blame Articuno for that one
5Yay it's cooler here than it was yesterday~ :3
I went to a boarding school and boy, there were food fights
5DRF, but have you seen them live?
03no
4He's not a brony, he's some douchebag that showed no emotion when his mom died
Those guys are boring.
03I generally don't like live performances
5With the TWELVE STRING BASS
8SPIDERMAN DERAIL
5and the FIVE NECK GUITAR
Yeah, Kick-Ass 2 is coming in 2012
5D:
I wanted a food fight in my high school but it never happened
!seen PResea
PResea was last seen here 14 days, 13 hours, 14 minutes ago.
/me 11had fist fights on a daily basis in his school, food fights in every week.
4Hell, I think his group of friends are even worse
He wants to be Paris Hilton?
heh
03sorry but all the videos of live stuff I've seen suck
5But a live performance is the truest mark of a band! :3 (IMO lol..)
03Eh
@hipster_brony don't make me post gary oak
03I don't care
03I like music that's catchy
4The dick with the glasses is the worst
Actually 2 volumes appeared right now
03if it takes some post-processing to make it sound good, so be it
03look at Eiffel 65
No, love interest is worst character
8inb4 ten badges
That fabulous hair
5cheaptrickiscatchy /shot
03they were insanely popular in like 2000
4The only good characters are Big Daddy and Hit Girl
Ghosties, he's certainly funnelled his emotions through his hormones.
D:
03and it's entirely autotuned, before they even had autotune
(no spoiling?)
11I like those guys, personally.
5But
Ghosties is incredibly right
Well.
Flutterguy fte
5I mean like bands that thrived on live performances when they were staring
5**starting
In Kick Ass 2, one of those guys will become a "hero"
Random Encounter!
03well all those bands are going to die of old age soon
I like Ned Flanders too
5like REO Speedwagon and CT and Rush and Journey and all those bands from that era. :3
@ghosties don't get me started on hit girl, ffs. I've hardly recovered from the moral dilemma in my head from last night surrounding hit girl
03granted, I've seen Weird Al twice, and he's good live
bastard
4One of the main character's friends becomes a "hero?"
03but even then, I prefer the album tracks
11lol, RBD
03it's just for the crazy stuff he does on stage XD
4God
He becomes an hero
yeah, he gets in the fad just for the fun of it
03I saw Trans-Siberian Orchestra live and was like meh, I'll stick to the CDs
4I don't think I would watch the second one
They stole my comics!
Sol, +1 internets to you
@ghosties, not at all?
5I know. :C But that's why I go to as many concerts as I can now. ^^; Live performance will soon be dead. /sigh
03no it won't
4Maybe if someone bought me a ticket or something
5All the GOOD live performances.
03as long as there are fangirls there will always be concerts
$100 for a wetsuit?
03it's just, now it's a squee competition
5By rock bands that are actually GOOD.
03well I';m not really a rock fan
darn, only 53
no way, it's 99
@ghosties oh I thought you meant maybe like this, watching for free lol
03I like RockBand, though, ironically XD
we can watch it at mbn
BRB, will come back after this scene
03I tend to like more techno/electronic stuff
bmn*
HeavyMetalPony OBJECTION. It's 99.99
4Well, if Kick Ass 2 was picked for the BMN I would watch it because I'm a mod
5Synth rock? :3
RACISM
03uh
03what's an example of that
It's Lex Luthor
@guest that sounds cool
lag
NOT THE BEES
5Uh, rock where synthesizer keyboards are used a lot
FUCK
11lag
FFFF
LAG
5a lot of prog rock uses it
03I mean like, a song or a band
LAG
8shits frozen yo
gave him the finger
dang
REWIND IT
laglaglaglaglag
yeah, fuck this lag
I like Synth/techo and orchestrated the best :P
5Like mini-moogs..?
wwwwww
fuu fuu
03LOL orchestrated
5Oh, um, Yes used them a lot.
11Popcorn
11And Pepsi
Took quiz, what I missed?
4That reminds me, gotta put up that dub I made of Hit Girl's fight later on
Wait, is that the main character?
11And an Icee
eww pepsi
03the Tron Legacy soundtrack is probably my favorite album in the past... few years
gunshot
what the hay is icee
He's gonna be fine
PEPSI IS GOOD.
03because that's both orchestrated and techno :P
So his dad's a drug lord?
lies
you missed murder
03and Daft Punk is awesome
coke is better
ALL LIES
ok, no.
Don't say anything against my fav drink.
5RUSH used them in the '80's on albums like Grace Under Pressure.
8DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT PEPSI
im back
MonsieurLeFlour: Just torture
Cool
6Sorry, got attacked by an update and it raped my upload speed.
@Pyrate yes
@ghosties gief

5I think Daft Punk is okay. But they've got integrity which is awesome. <3
give
gief
hawt
Cool stuff.
same difference :P
03integrity how?
Torture....oh, the Batman scene.
nerrrrrrrrrd
Pepsi? Why Pepsi? I hate Pepsi!
4Oh, you want the link?
Time for cosplay!

don't spoil anything.
well yeah, later though :P
4Alright
Haters gonna hate
for those who didn't see it.
why would he hide his awesome hair?
in walks parents XD
8Pepsi > Coke dealwithit.jpg
11Rarity: Oh my Stars! How can you even THINK of going out with those colors?!
5Well, from what I've read, they're truly just about the music.
He looks kinda cool! Okay no. No he doesn't.
6I love the dinosaur stickers.
03oh
he has a poor taste in fashion.
Those are some manly dinosaur stickers
Is *fuck censored in the kinect version of this scene?
Rarity would be ashamed.
Coke > pepsi dealwithitevenmore.jpg
8the Green Condom!
5And they have literally the best use of autotune out there. xD
i love this scene
Pepsi Max > all other soft drinks. People be gettin mad, RBD be not carin'
He'd watch FiM, you know it
Coke > Pepsi! Let the coke wars BEGIN!
03XD
4ENTER NICHOLAS FUCKING CAGE
Silverscreen: Rarity in disguise breaking fourth wall
CAGE
03though most of their good songs are instrumental
DA BEST CHARACTERS
NED!
Silver: Well, would you rather paint a bullseye everywhere on the suit?
11NICK FUCKING CAGE!
love you too
Love this scene.
5Which is another great thing.
4Or, as some clever user said, Bad Ass Ned Flanders
Coke > Pepsi
Hurray for the tow greatest people on Earth
*two
Gotta love uncalled for kicking
11...Correction
Wait, they're-
wat
11PSYCHO CAGE!
obvious glued on moustache
Ah, they are
ahuehuehue
Just stand diddly still, baby doll
03as far as best use of autotune, I vote Eiffel 65 :P
lul
You know youre a red neck if you shoot your own young for fun
03since I totally love that band
5The opening band at last night's concert.. well, frankly they were not that good. Sounded like a Green Day/Fall Out Boy knockoff.
8did she died?
Kinda fun, huh?
His last name is fucking Cage
5Eiffel 65 rocks for dance music.
>_>
"Daddy, I peed"
How badass is that?
03I like Green Day but they suck live.
5So I've heard.
12lol
4Except he's not a red neck
5Hey LL!
03which is why I don't really care about concerts
12i misread that as green bay
what if he missed
03I've never actually seen them live, I just saw videos
true
12green bay packers~~
*moustache-touch*
^
Ftw
GOTCHA
12hai Role
Missed one
No guns allowed on the lanes
/me 12only here for a bit
/me 12eyes the time
I love her character.
:O
haha I troll u dad
SHE WANTS THE MLP FiM DVD
12one day drf will do band for the greenbay packers
Dad, I want a Rainbow Dash toy
Goodily diddly call, baby doll
5That's why you have to research what bands are great live and which ones aren't. xD And only go to the good ones.
over the line mark it zero
8trolling successful
lol
11This is a good example of how Cage's acting abilities depends on what role he gets.
balisongs!!!
Little girl confirmed for favourite character
11He fucking owns in this role.
audience reaction was gold.
5Besides the only band I've actually had to shell out money to see is RUSH. All the others were free concerts and they were great.
4@Silver: Absolutely
8Nick Cage is best actor
03I just don't go to concerts XD
5(Most of 'em.)
He's just fantastic in this.
@silverscreen I love him in this film
yeah, because in some roles Nicholas Cage only has one facial expression
>implying Cage doesn't kick ass all the times
5Even free ones?
@Silverscreen: What Ghosties said.
all of them
03uh
03well
8NOT THE BEES
03I went to a free Caravan Palace concert
I love Gone in 60 Seconds. Why? Cage
03those guys were amazing
>implying Nick Cage is sometimes a bad actor
8IMMA VAMPIRE
how'd it get burn'd?!?
03that's one group that's better live than on the album
11He's great here, but he wasn't that good in Ghost Rider.
A. B. C. D
4Oh come on, he kicked women's asses in The Wicker Man
03they're an interesting mix of classical and techno
>implying nicolas cage has >1 facial expressions
But seriously, best role since...well this is my favorite Cage role actually
4How is that not bad ass
03kinda like Daft Punk, but a lot more loud XD
5But do they have live albums? /eyebrow waggle
5 /shot
8DONT TALK SHIT ABOUT NICK CAGE
>etc alphabet
Which kind of vampire? The one that dies in sunlight or sparkles in sunlight?
he crazy
Oh crap
oh shit epic
03XD
MY HARRY VAMPIRE
03nah
Wait, Ghost rider? The one where he is immolated alive? Where did I hear that before?
This is gonna go to hell
03they only have one CD
Literally
CHICKEN OUT, LIEK A BAWS
11Sol: LOL
03and ironically, like Daft Punk, they're French.
EPIC MUSIC

someone is probably thinking, shit, who's running on the roof?
loool
8get out of my head, ghosties
Thanks for spoiling :(
11Ghosties: win.
/me 12holds her head
Maybe he should start avoiding that shortcut.
5Yeah most of my fave bands are getting into their 60's and 'bout ready to retire. :C Even though they still rock on stage.
Spoiler: He's green
"What da Eff?"

Let's just enjoy.
Pyrate: Critical on his Constitution roll
daym this movie seems good
greatplan
Ah, I see.
Random classical bgm for the win.
Ogod, this scene
5http://www.therushforum.com/index.php?showtopic=9400&view=findpost&p=2323621 <---- My sort-of-review of the concert I saw last night if anyone cares. ^^;
The horror ;_;
4There was one plot point that the film makers decided to leave out in relation to Big Daddy
4According to the original comic
classical music: instantly makes you classy
inb4 oh god
OH MAN
6inb4 oatmeal
inb4 WHY
5WALL OF TEXT lol... There's a reason my username is "CMWriter" over there.
and drf, learn2notcomplain about that face :P
11Oatmeal
The only time I hate change if it creates plotholes
oatmeal?
11This is now Pony Revelent.
03or lrn2notpissmeoff
inb4 because the nuts are the best part of oatmeal
sweet
8and i said oatmeal, are you crazy?
Finish yer oatmeal.
guys i just joind to see if people were still here why is the movie still playing
nuts in oatmeal? ARE YOU CRAZY?
Oh, it's not this scene
Oatmeal is enjoyed with a few spoonfulls of apple sauce
Fail
4But I actually agree that if they had kept that particular plot point from the comic it would have been detrimental to the film's solidity
Ghosties, what plot point?
learn2notcomplain about that face :P
03no.
yes.
fan art
Seriously, this is like the 97th greatest film of all time.
4Big Daddy wasn't a cop in the comic
ah
Wasn't the comic book and the movie developed simultaneously?
oh really ghosties?
you're all decadent, oatmeal doesn't have anything but oats and milk in it
alrighty
4He was, in fact, just a regular nerd just like the main character
13lrn2beneutral
13:3c
03dare to be stupid
12... >>
and maybe a little butter
BALISONGS
It'd be like symbolic or something
11Ghosties: I think the cop aspect is cool.
>implying you can't make oatmeal with water
BUTTERFLY KNIVES!
4But he actually was this bad ass character
@ghosties fair, although I think i prefer this one. he has motive to be so uber badass
Future Spy
12... <<
/me 8doesnt read comics, didnt know there was a comic of this movie
she's a SPAH
also, in the movie he's nick cage
12lolz song
@ghosties getoutofmyhead.tif
We got the knife and the Familiar fez in one Show.
4When it does come to characters, I also enjoy this version of Big Daddy
She's so pro
4I mean hell, it's NICK CAGE
I personally like the cop aspect, I didn't like the comics version of big daddy
I love this actress, why they make no more of her ;_;
06what
12I find Weather to be a funny word today
13Funny word of the day?
so many beaches
hello? XD
She was in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie
he has his OWN OFFICE?! oh wait XD
only reason I even knew that movie existed was because she was in it.

so how do these knives work?
03that's one random video I found
13!espeon
Spy knife
NOW IT'S THIS SCENE
Disappointed when she didn't rip off Patty's head
12JUICE
4She was also in "Let Me In"
magic, Elky
12thats the funny word of the day
With the Familiar Fez
12LOL
Hey! I have that same microwave to cook my meals.
4And she WAS a vampire in the movie
obviously
Reminds me of Gremnlins
Ghosties: original was better
Put it on 2 minutes.
Five?
lolthisscene
or maybe magnets
4I never saw the original
8interrogation fail in 3... 2... 1...
Hungry Man dinner XD
4I wanted to though
Ghosties: it's on Youtube if you want
06:3
His radiation level is over 9000!!!
4I hate the Westernized title
This is even worse if you know how microwaves work ;____________;
4Let Me In sounds so...
BOOM!!!!!!
BOOOOOOOOOM
HAAHB
rofl classical music
Did he died?
PERFECT TIMING
aww....he didn't turn into a ghoul
4Let The Right One In sounds much better
so...how does it work? o3o
No, he good
God, physics class made this movie a lot more disturbing
that wouldn't happen in a real microwave?
5That's pretty shweet~
12OH Angel
Mythbusters Proved that doesn't happen
03yeah I know right
4What does happen then?
13o-o
lol, implied rape
12a kinda new gaia grant thing
03I bought their CD after I saw the concert but it wasn't that good
12http://www.gaiaonline.com/grant?key=hueyichooseyou
5I love the mix of instruments but the vocalist's work leaves much to be desired, just imo.
you'd cook
You'd be steamed alive.
03yeah, I don't really like the vocals either
er, be cooked
SMACK!
Well, what happens when the water molecules in a body starts to vibrate?
5But it sounds a little better at about 1:00.
03there were some entirely instrumental onems
03*ones
Microwaves causes water molecules inside food to vibrate fast enough to where it warms the food
just like microwave food
12if you haven't got it already
4Ewwww
Sure, but I know how it should've worked
the tray hit is amazing hahaha
And then he choked to death
13Awesome, thanks :3
In other words, you'd be boiling from the inside of your own body
The first thing that would happen is you'd go blind.
5How many instrumentalists are up there? Five?
Cuz the optic nerve cant dissipate heat
http://www.flickr.com/photos/enithepuppy/3460703766/ XD
4Sol: I will not forget those words for many nights to come
he so beta
4Thanks for that
03I think there's 4 plus the singer
metal implants make you 20% cooler
Well, I see food pop in my microwave all the time when it is put slightly too strong
5Hm.
hey - now that you've been raped i find you more attractive
That's why it makes me ;______________;
Peeps, but that guy
03around 4:20 is what I was talking about XD
03how they have the electronic part in there
PhotoFINISHHim, you forget the fked up nervous system
Although, you did ask :p
5I think too many and it starts to sound crowded. But four-five is good.
he's just jealous
Dermathil: I managed to pop chicken once
4I shouldn't have asked
03and at the actual concert it was like bass so loud you could feel it
03it was awesome
4I regret it now
Bitches and whores.

03yep
I feel the need to point out a lot of random things
END OF MOVIE HE'S DEAD
4I think I do like Coke Cola over Pepsi
but he bought pepsi max, and pepsi max>cola>pepsi
i think
03the concert i went to was their first time in Ann Arbor
Cockta > Coke or Pepsi. GO OBSCURE DRINKS ONLY I KNOW
Round 2! FIGHT!
GREAT.
11They missed out on a good Mr Bitey joke to use there.
!base
4I typically like both just the same
;p
DAT MUSIC
/me owns: ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US
FIGHT NOW
FREAKING GREAT.
good Ghosties
6STRIFE
Coca cola > Pepsi > Pepsi Max
AS SOON AS WE GET TO AN AWESOME FIGHT SCENE, LA-
Song sounds familiar
11Dat music.
4But Coke has a certain taste to it
The Prodigy?
oh wait it works nao
Yep
YEAH!
suddenly badass
DAT MUSICCCCCC
4Pepsi is just boring
Omen, should've known it
dat soundtrack, I forgot how amazing this film's music is
I love that song
11Coke is sweeter, Pepsi is healthier.
group fights can be a bitch
He should have used lethal weapons
CHILL IN THE SPINE FROM AWESOMENESS
Get a knife/gun/knifegun, dude
10no
4Healthier?
lol for all he knows the guy they're beating up is a child molester
I ned to download the soundtrack for this after it's done.
yes
4Silver, they're both highly carbonated and highly caffeinated
;p
lol healthier
5One time there was this girl trying to convince me that Adam Lambert was the greatest musician in the universe and I was like, "Dude, my fave band had released 9 albums by the time he was BORN."
anyone know the name of this artist?
8Coke is too sweet
Pepsi... healthier....? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>totally going to download soundtrack after this
if your worried about health why would you get a soft drink?
It's also partially htdrogenated
Coke is 20% sweeter
do !cmds for a list of commands :P
*hydrogenated
4I will say this though
11HeavyMetalPony: Agreed. This soundtrack is awesome.
5FOR GREAT JUSTICE
4Pepsi Blue?
and 20% cooler
4Awesome stuff
The song is called Omen, by The Prodigy
awesoem shit
In case someone wanted to know
They still make that?!?
I would use stealth to take out those guys
I like how they're just watching instead of calling the cops
4God, I wish they still made Pepsi Blue
I feel sorry for you guys. You will never taste the awesomeness that is Cockta
Pepsi Blue?
13Why do a lot of girls I know think Adam Lambert is good-looking :|
6Pepse Blue was AMAZING
8Pepsi Blue was the worst soda in history
6*Pepsi
yeah it was.
NARM
4Pepsi Blue was a short lived product in the early 2000's
Don't think they sold that here
o_O
6I can't brain today.
ah who am I kidding, I would probable get killed even if I used stealth
New Cola was worse
Yus got balls kid *closes knife. yus got balls
5Ugh beats me. Not that the feeling would ever be mutual for them, unfortunately. |3
i <3 pepsi blue
pepsi max is best max
/me 11doesn't remember Pepsi Blue
:p
4Hipster: Well, that's just, like, your opinion man
Thank yu
Crystal Pepsi was worse dontcha know
Adam Lambert is a fine singer, horrible dresser XD
New Cola is bad
Adam Lambert is odd :P
/me shot
I'm a brony
8ghosties: dealwithit.jpg
fuck yeah
youtubeeee
4Oh god, someone brought up Crystal Pepsi
I like his dressing :P
HeavyMetalPony Really? Me too! I wonder if there's more bronies here
6I like throwback.
8crystal pepsi lol
They did Orange Coke a few years ago which must be the logical opposite of Pepsi Blue
/me flees
12Imagine
Coffe Cola was the shit
6Natural sugar = healthier
What about that rip off Pepsi Vanilla?
And it was AMAAAAAAZING
Most common phrase in the BMN chat: Dealwithit.jpg
12I don't think he is
had to happen, bad soda is bad, and Crystal pepsi sucked
Is this a bad time to say I love Vanilla Coke?
Is independence day being streamed at 7 EST?
Needs more Mountain Dew >:
11> Myspace
WHAT ABOUT THE 300 GLITCH?
24 mil = most viewed?
I like vanilla coke too, for a soda
>301 views
4I have absolutely no desire to try it other than the fact that I bet it tastes like shit, my curiosity gets the best of me
He is what? :P
5http://www.rocktownhall.com/blogs/media/blogs/rth/Rush2112.jpg <--- Adam Lambert isn't worse than /this/ though!! :P
8sprinkles: throwback soda is best soda

6Not knowing Scott Pilgrim is a sin around here.
Scott Pilgrim, I hope someone suggest it some day
Ghosties my A movie selection is either gonna be SP vs the world or The Wicker Man
isn't scott pilgrim a science fiction comic?
wow, you weren't shitting us, that's amazing

4Which Wicker Man, RainBro?
Hipster_brony you are the complete opposite of a hipster O_O

Hipster, are there any comics you DO know?
Scott Pilgrim was originally a comic yes
Ghosties I prefer the original, but DAT NICK CAGE BEES FREAKOUT BREH
beta as fuck
11Scott Pilgrim is a movie, based off of a comic book, that parodies video games.
5There was an entire section in their documentary about their lack of fashion savvy-ness. "We desperately just wanted to wear jeans and a t-shirt..."
am i the only one that cant see the movie?
Wait, so since I know Scot Pilgrim I didn't sin....let me fix that.....I think the bat credit card is an awesome idea!
5...and now they do.
And it's a good comic.
what.
4If you pick the original, you will have my respects bro
I found him to have been bright with that one line
Ghosties but THE BEES
4But yes, Nick Cage fucking rules regardless
PRETENDING TO BE GAY, SCORE PHONE NUMBER ANYWAY

Sucks that both this movie and Scott Pilgrim didn't do to well
This and Scott Pilgrim both had terribad box office >:
yeah
HERD MIND!
and they're both awesome movies
On the bright side Vampires Sucks was very succesful...ow wait
so yeah ghosties i have happy face now, given that he doesn't take back the offer of giving me that xbox
Sad, but not really unexpected, y'know?
ouch heavy, that hurt
The average movie viewers are idiots for not watching them
Ass. Kick
it just goes to show that even though a movie can be total shit people will see it anyway
4Awesome man
He's Shatner
4Hope he goes through with it
ikr as do it
as do i*
11Cage channels Shatner in this scene
what's with the weird speech?
He should've sounded like ADAM WEST
^ five other people, we all laughed nonstop
must've been cool darf
in the shape of a giant cockatrice
4*catches it*
4*puts it on nipples*
oh god Ghosties
I was the target audience for Scott Pilgrim, 100%.
WRITE THE 34 GOGOGO
@Elky I took advantage of it :)
I know.
8if i saw one of those cocka thingies i would laugh at how silly it was
I'm not sure if I want to hear about it...
Ghosties, on googledocs by Thursday, I'll nbe waiting
@hipster dat line
Oh, Hipster, you so silly
4NAHMAN JAYDEN

He's not JOISEYAN enough for Nahmen
;_;
I lagged out of the gore.
6HERRO THERE
lol
Crap, missed the scene
What a douche
bumblebee
4God, now I wanna play Heavy Rain

Wait what?
11Hell yeah, Ditko.
>Benefits of being gay
*playing gay
@rellek hnnnnnnnggg
PRETEND TO BE GAY, STILL GET TO RUB DOWN NAKED CHICKS
but men singing high is yucky D:
I'm looking to see if I can get a band going with some friends, actually.
no u
still?
8sometimes i wish i were gay...
HNNNNNNNNNNNG
:|
Ghosties: read Pony Rain if you feel like playing that. The quality is through the roof.
like... gay, but also straight...
I pull off gay really well.
Aaaaaaaaw shit, son
5LL, unless they can actually pull it off and sound good, like Lee used to be able to.
4Huh, I see
Closest person to a real-life superhero - wikipedia Jack Churchill.
h8rz be h8in
Should I mimic Whelp and bring up the kinsley scale?
still as in most times pretending to be gay wouldn't help get into people's pants
Fact: Girls don't really do this with their friends, unless they play for the other team
everyone thinks I'm gay anyways so lol
No seriously. That fic was brilliant.
5Jon Anderson is another one that sounded pretty good singing high. (of Yes)
8lol leflour
Time for cell shader : D
o.o
In WWII he charged german beaches playing the bagpipes and then pulled out a claymore and started hacking people up
how high?

Closest person to a real-life superhero - read about Theodore Roosevelt on Cracked.
5We're talking.. soprano, pretty much.
Big Daddy is a rad artist too?
o.o
so falsetto
yuck
Carry a big stick, like Teddy
I wouldn't say soprano.
Big Daddy multitasks
Alto, more like it.
4I'll take your word for it. Unfortunately, I don't read much fanfiction anymore
11I want more motion comics like this.
5Alto I. (;
They did this to save money on acting and special effects
reminds me of kill bill
yuck
4You know, you'd probably like Repo! Silver
Still not usual men range.
4They have the same visual transition style like this
11Repo! The Genetic Opera?
4Yeah
11Already have it.
it's strange lol
4Hah
5I don't know, Anderson sounded pretty legit in some of those songs. But maybe he was just really good at falsetto. /shrug
4It's good, isn't it?
I read your comic, it sucked.
11Yes, it is.
Ooh! We should watch that sometime. Maybe. If we haven't already.
Needed more Spider-Man
I can sing reasonably high somewhat well.
4You know, I wouldn't mind watching that in the BMN at some point
11That, Little Shop of Horrors, and Sweenie Tood. :D
WTF

Wait, lemme guess.
4Do you know what an axident is?
5^ That's a great song too.
Ghosties: True, we only have cold accidents here.
So did I miss anything important in the last week?
eeyup
There are a whole bunch of people masquerading as Kick-Ass
Ah.
oh impersonater :|
We have two potential new mods
5I squee'd when they played both YYZ and La Villa this last tour. xD
-.-- / -.-- / -..
accidents with tomahawks
we started a steam group
surprise! it was fake
wait
You never heard of Cos-Play Mr. Mobster
i messed that up
lol :D
and a steam group jacked our logo
-.-- / -.-- / --..
Throw Kick Ass party...everybody dies...profit?
Is it just me, or does it lag a lot?
But, DCD wants to play nice with them.
Clark Kent: surprisingly good secret ident
5YOU ARE NO NEIL PEART. xD
Which I think makes sense
POWDERBLOCKER
5Have you heard the ESL version of that one?
Even if it was fucked up of them to steal our logo
well, that means a lot of leftover snacks
so yeah, profit
its fine now (finally)
RP4L i know these people at school that try to play that on the drum whenever they get their hands on a drumstick and i don't think they ever get it right

But I like Tony.
5But that fact that they know that song at all is a miracle.
;^;
5Rush just isn't that popular with our generation. :C
Tony the Tiger! How could you!
The gist of it is if Silver wants to do them a logo or not
except guitar hero
Because that was DCD's plan
Nuke: Tony = Tacowiz, though
5Lol yeah.
oh
Well fuck Tony then.
Red Mist?

Troll move
"Holy crap, what happened to my balls?"
Pretty good :3
Hitgirl's the best character.

4I still think Big Daddy is best character
11Nukeiffum: No. Nick Cage is best character
(I'm just happy Cage is gone)
4But Hit Girls is /just/ right below him
06I have no idea what Chao is talking about and that just makes it sound really odd o.o
/me 11smacks Elky
I'll agree with that.
4one is nuzzling her baby, one is crying
4a movie
He's Nick Cage combined with Batman gone rogue
Let the rest of the movie speak for itself
How is that not the best thing ever?
I have no Objections to that statement
4 2 girls get pregnant and the dad is a jerk and abondons them
4Elky, you're outnumbered here. Everyone in this chat fucking loves Nick Cage
10What Xeli said, and please stop typing the details and watch the movie quietly? :P
the kicking today has been bloody rife
Chuckles at Elky
4lawl
not gonna lie

He has the mass on his side.

4Well, he is a crime lord

I thought all he had going for him was a mean roundhouse.
Actually, it's a Minigun, Gatling-type Machinegun
Dude, you have a jet-pack gatling gun! You can beat him in 10 seconds flat.

11I see this and first thought is True Grit.
we have a number of people i know are Dash fans too
Marston, is that you?
lolol
I'd play it.
4I see this and first thought is "Man, I wish I had Red Dead Redemption"
we should watch true grit at BMN, but it's a bit too recent
gonna get going for a bit
bbl~
Likewise, Ghosties.
how ironic of trixie
I see this and thought muffin
unless we watch the original
11Which version? Old or new?
0It's highly overrated, Ghosties.
Wait....Its Red Dead Redemption right?
I have RDR, and now I feel the sudden urge to replay it
Needs more Magnets
And yes
LOL that's cool, I have one of them too.
4I've played and beaten RDR, Bjornfot
4And I absolutely loved it
I thought RDR was amazing.
I agree with Ghosties
The ending is sad though

this is something that can handle this power
just count the houwas
4I don't like modern rap/hip hop
No one mare should have all this pony.

I find this video surprising lacking until the very end
4who here likes googol?
Me neither, but PONIES

I don't really like the music, but that picture is great\
4No

03you're asking if we like a very large number?
ghosties me neither, it gets on my nerves so much. But I don't tell everyone I always mute this :3

>Only one who can tolerate rap
HeavyMetalPony is okay with Silverscreen's potential AMV
;_;
When you see the video it's based on, this matches it amazingly
Now for the Jackass intro
@Ghosties, most modern/pop music is over synthed shit anyway, many feel the same as you do
4yesh :)
I don't mute, it's basic courtesy, you don't want others to mute your request
>only one who really enjoys rap
This is the best thing ever
4do yuu?
4But seriously, I just can't tolerate modern rap/hip hop. It's all entertainment these days
>by obscure Japanese artists
4er, do you?

Ghosties, modz be hatin' on controversially opinioned non-mods, so i stay silent :D
How long does this last again? 24 minutes?
8theres some other rap that i like, but nothing on the radio
Old rap is good ('90s rap).

2uh, ya, good luck :)
Do you mean the video that we watched earlier?
0I don't even Wonka and his slave labor army of candy artisans could handle The Pinkie at that level.
2then that means you'll do great
yeh'
Because that one is called PONIES: The Anthology
0I don't even think*, derpy typing abounds.
2nervous people are capable, non-nervous people get nervous when it's too late
You can find it on Youtube.
4The original film was soooooo much better than the remake
anthology, fuck yeah
Is there a John Freeman pony?
10That's not the case with me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9B_6PH4dhU
totally agreed Ghosties
For the nostalgia
If I ever get picked for B film, I'll def choose this
2right
4Oh shit, Dash looks pissed
2noone here is human i forgot
That nostalgia ;_;
TUNE
LOVE IT
7o.O
2well, maybe drf is
niiiiiiiiiice ad
8what is up with Dash's face?
/me 7pokes Drake|TF2.
spasmface
What's up with her hair?
0I didn't see the remake, don't plan to either.
04wat
pure badass
2Quany back :3
13Don't worry, interviews aren't as unnerving as people make it out to be xD
80s hair
7Did I know you played TF2? O_o
11I loved Grandpa George in the new one, though
04Nope
rainbow dash is now elvis
04I only got it yesterday
this is why Rainbow dash is the best pony
11Grandpa George in the remake was hilarious.
06:3
2i forgot to ask, Shiny? Level?
7Aaaaaaaaah.
04after 13 hours of downloading
6interview where, skylands?
4The new one was just...bleh
7Shiny Latios.
06I'll try tracking you down on steam I guess
Rainbow duckbill... frightening.
Because George in the original was just another old fart
6steam
Hey guys, Hasbro released a MLP Puzzle
ALL WHO DENY RAINBOWDASH AS THE BEST PONY WILL HAVE THEIR UNICORN REMOVED, UNICORN OR NOT@!
6quiznos? togos?
06hnnng why do I have to sleep soonish lol
/me 6lol

I have spoken...
Wat?

0>unicorn removed
2kk
10Nope
6anways
2NOW i'll get started
11Starflier: Come at me bro.
I think you meant "Horn" removed
So many cans of Red Pony. Rainbow will be up all night.
7Want me to join you guys? :P
7(After DW?)
/me won't say for privacy reasons
yeah...distracted a bit
04sureiguess
pft
6just wear a skirt and blouse, do your hair, and be smiley
;p
0Starflier just became a meme.
Silverscreen, which one is your favorite?
04feel free quan
6doesn't matter how nervous you are, that helps a ton
0Red bull? Rainbow is already a pegasus, and awesome.
10I don't have those :P
03and depending on how old the person is, show some clevage
06Drake, steam, I can't find you there
/me runs
06cry
Starflier WOOT IM A MEME1
10But I have nicer clothes to wear
6get some?
04I've just been playing with bots because I suck
6k
8if the answer is anything besides Rainbow Dash, it's wrong
LOL
TRUEDAT!
6what's considered "nice" lol
7Hey, when NS sets up that server, we can all play together. :P
My answer is my own
Actually it's every pony in the mane cast
7Then you can see how fail I am. :P
someone mentions horns cut off > interpret dick metaphor > think about hornjobs
10Dress pants and a decent shirt
11Rarity Pony is best Pony.
0LUNA is best pony!
6k
/me needs to get those though
7Ascendent.
4How about
04sweet
10All I have is T-Shirts mostly :P
FANDOM, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
6yeah just make yourself more than presentable, jobs love that
4All ponies are best ponies
11Luna is second best pony
tsk.. Fluttershy's stare owns Rainbow Dash any day
To be honest, I'm starting to love Rarity more than the rest
6the more casual, the less likely you get the job
Dark_Horst> Rainbow dash is awesome...
So I'd actually agree with Silver
Silly Silver, that's not how you spell Zecora
Awesome music, Rainbow
is it true Rainbowdash is lesbo? IS IT?
6Rarity is best pony. Deal.
04ah
13I don't really have any clothes that are considered "smart" LOL
/me 7lols:
i never said anything else
4Yes Starflier
13so it took me forever to find something decent
Zecora's no pony
04Roara
7There's a person named Inception about Dream World. XD
8starflier: nope.avi
11Luna's placement on being best pony depends on how she is in S2
Rarity is not best....UNLESS SHES SECOND BEST :d!
04I love how our nicks are the same length
(Yes, I know my steam avatar is a RD one. I just can't find a Zecora one in the meantime)
06lol
My Steam avatar is a Fluttershy one
<---funniest person here
4The original Candy Man
oh, we're talking about best ponies?
11Nostalgia HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
no, Were talking about Rainbow dash
alrgith, who can spell that?
okay then
k
6His level of pedo... depends.
doesn't overlap
4Scrumdiddlyumptious
13I've either got really casual clothes (takes up 98% of all my clothes lol) or really formal clothes
4It's not very hard
6drake, quan, what are your steam names
7<
13formal includes prom dress, which I hate wearing :|
7And a guy named Jeffx on DW. XD
04uh
4Or were you talking about something else, Dark?
8Hey little boys, i have even more candy in my windowless white van
7Ah, TLS.
SCUMRADGJKR; its hard for me >:(
04gimme a sec
04I'm still sorting this steam thing out
i'm just tired
Time for the party van?
Hipster,Sonic told me not to trust strangers!
NO!
/me 11knows how to make a scrumdidlyumptious bar. :D
Giving out free candy? The fuck?
*gets out of here*
0mfw communism
6I'll try and track down a decent server
HOW DOES HE STAY IN BUSINESS?
4If someone touches you in a place or a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's good
Exactly
0I approve of this ability, Silverscreen.
7Wait for me, I'm almost done. :P
4So, what do you do?
Sounds like Fallout: Equestria got updated. For all those who are interested.
6RaZor921: Yeah, and then the poor kid comes by and has to pay. XD
6as for clothes, I have mostly casual, but a fair amount of formal clothes
Rainbowdash backwards is hsadwobnair
RaZor: When the Golden Tickets get announced, he'll make back the millions he lost in freebies
First, you say no!
*gasp*
4First, you say "that's good" and then YOU GET OUTTA THERE!
6quan it may take a while to find a server lol
8starflier: cool story bro

DJ Derp-E
Silverscreen: I think you mean El Mudo
D:
Derpy Hooves
Hum.
Luna
So.
Derpy is second best pony.
?
I'll probably get kicked for this, but I've never been kicked
4Vinyl Scratch is absolute best pony
Derpy rules!
YES GHOSTIES
You're damn right she is, Ghosties.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NoRUgH9Chs
but seriously ghosties get out of my head, im not gonna warn you again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCpdDS3L2xs&feature=related
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSI8X4Gy4LA
Mute the stream. Started some rock music. Open stream to see Derpy DJ. How fitting.
More Nostalgia.

11...
inb4EarRape
11lol Derpy
Hey, Silver, what do you think about a Nick Cage special weekend in October? Wicker Man and Vampire's Kiss?
Chuck Norris would be Celestia's dad.
Chuck Norris isn't a very good actor
6I didn't ask for standard
6I asked what you wanted to play lol
13The Game
13:<
4That's pretty neat actually
6lost it
10no
Silly Derpy.
Cool. :D
The reason Celestia and Luna are princesses, not queens, is because they know Chuck Norris is the only true King.
ANIMANIACS
6Feather. FEATHER.
7Eh, I'll go with CP. Or maybe Payload.
10Aurora. AURORA.
11Ani-mane-iacs
Animaniacs = love
Silly song, that's not how you pronounce Ponies
6!pokemon
Roara|TF2, you are a 14Liepard.
10!pokemon
Feather, you are a 4Watchog.
10ew
/me sighs
THE PLOT
plot...
oooh, we need the Pinkie And The Brain intro!
13!pokemon
Fluttershy's Plot
04Roara

7Steam is not loading. :|
/me 11starts headbobbing
Lol.
6also drifblim <3
2Feather! long time no chat
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU RARITY?!!
What is the art of the dress?
This is pretty cool.
11...that background is horrid.
WE ARE ALL HOMIEBROPONIES (created a meme right there :D)
/me starts fistpumping
HEADBOB EVERYBRONY!!!
/me is listening to Nirvana
/me 7restarts said Steam.
0Rarity, close your mouth.
Rarity looks horrid
this video needs a klingon to her left
who made this song btw?
10must be cause I dunno who you are o.o
*headbobs*
/me is listening to DJ Fresh again.
Haddaway
11and that black wood look underneath the gold DJ stand does NOT work.
Agreed Silverscreen. Rarity would be ashamed of putting red against her purple hair
"WHAT IS LOVE?"
2er, Quan? any specific pokeball? Perish Ball? :P
This song is pure nostalgia to me
lol I dunno
I listened to it A LOT when I was a kid
2and YUU DON'T REMEMBER ME!!1???!!?
6I feel like a DJ, sitting in this cafe headbobbing with my giant headphones.
got my nephew to headbang 2 :D
13The awkward moment where your friend forgets who you are
2:(
11Razor921: NIght at the roxbury? :D
7Cherish Ball for Darkrai, hmm... Dive Ball for Latios.
Nope
i am sorry, but i always hated that song
The song itself aired on radio
kinda annyong
am i evil?
Put ponies into song, somehow it becomes good.
13I'm still proud of the fact I got Kyogre in HG in a great ball
Night at the Roxbury actually inspired the original trollface.
0Don't Eat the Mushroom, anyone?
I remember when we were on a car trip to Italy, this song played about 7 times or so
The more you know...
And forty bronies all headbob at once.
13Colour coordination ftw
10Dive Ball for Latios? wtf?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGvZa3tiYwY
my head hurts, make it stop
7I like it since it's blue and its nice exit effect.
11GET OUT OF MY HEAD, BJORNFOT!!!!
Anyone played Assassin's Creed 2?
potatojack I'm bobbing, but to drum n bass :L
i feel light headed and i has headache
Of course you have
6what is going on
Clearly you are not experienced in efficient long-term headbobbing
WAT IS PONY\

7Say, Rora, did you friend me on Steam? o.o

10all my pokemon are in regular pokeballs LOL
...god that is hella long.
6no
10breeding ftw?
that would be epic
0PMV's have introduced some of my brony friends to music they would have otherwise never heard or gotten into, so yes Ponies+Song does indeed = good idea.
6whats your name there
0Really, Silverscreen? You a Nifflas fan?
7<
Maybe o
6k
Anyway, I've been to every major area that you visit in Assassin's Creed 2 when I was a kid
7Thank you.
sprinkles, i think its time for some trolling: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p45XUXM-TAk
7I've gotta eat dinner, so I'll see you in one moment.
11no, I just like the Don't eat the Mushroom vid.

The level of troll is about to rise.
06Looking at Quan's friend list it should be easy to figure out who's me
/me hides
Well, Ponies won't ever fix Wierd Al, since he didn't need fixing to begin with!!!
11One is that stupid ass pig who shall not be named
I be so funny...

/me 11fucking hates the DDR for this song.
I thought it would be Too Shy by Kajagoogoo at first
6I like angel in the corner.
This song is also Nostalgia
7One quick return:

0Must every pegasi manifest a wingboner whilst DJing?

Too Shy is played in PONIES: The Anthology
WHY IZ NOONE RAVING!!

Smells Like Teen Spirit is an awesome song when you haven't heard it in a while.
10I wish I could draw something decent T-T
I already listened to it razor, it is
7Practice. o3o
Silverscreen do you ever get less awesome?
10I guess it was a bad idea not to draw anything for like a month lol
13Feather, ALL of your drawing are way beyond "decent" :P
Your hate only makes the mod's wingboners harder
10not to meee
im not a butterfly....IM A FLUTTERSHY :d
11RainBroDash: Nope.
Phew, then I get to keep those 50 bucks

ANIMANIACS I think?

That means I'm going to sleep in 15 minutes
I like good lyrics with my songs or none
At least it's a spiced up version, not old school twangy banjo.
sleeep... sounds awesome
Independence Day is when Britain gets ponies for the first time. Fuck yeah Britain indeed
TRIVIA: Starflier is only 13 ,but is a great uncle
0Pancho and Lefty, or Who's a Silly Pony?, that's what I expected Apple Jack to play.
HEY don't knock the banjo
0Banjos are cool.
banjo's are epic
I prefer flutes personally
Hey, should someone message Sethisto about the movie in 15 minutes?
banjos are epic when use in the appropriate situation

I prefer Violins, but that's beside the point

8Silver: thank the fucking lord
WE BE HAPPY FOR BUDGET CONSTRAINTS THEN
I'm sort of glad she didn't Silver.

Also I just came out of watching The Dark of the Moon
GAASSSSSDSPPP
/me 8could listen to this all day
Yeah, I think the video was called MLP Fanfic
I did a week ago.
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x8bZJPovUQ
Did Sethisto at least say something about this?
I had it looped the whole day.
Please say yes.
yeah I'm gonna go play TF2 I don't really like Independence day enough to suffer it tonight, I'll probably be back later though
Hey
11Found it.
But i ment really.
nope
wait, oshit I be scared. WIll I even remember at the end of the summer that I don't have hoofs but hands?
I wasn't at the computer all the time though, but it was still playing. XD
I'm going to bed when Independence Day starts
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
I think me too
DCD, I heard the movie was as bad as the original in the trilogy. Was that true?
By the end of summer you will have hooves.

Today, I bought a Rainbow Dash KEYCHAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ooh, nice.
GRATZ COLGATE
Dermathil: I'd say it was much better where it counts

Shit.
I think I'm gonna go order a Aj keychain...maybe
0Colgate, you rock, woohoo.
Bummer man
That would have brought in so many more people.
found it
You got the best pony too.
I've yet to find any MLP-related merchandise in my area
/me 11has a Twilight Toy. :P
Colgate Gained 500 reputation with Starflier (+50 rainbowdash bonus!)
Alright. 'Cause Moviebob is my #1 movie critic that I listen to and he said that the movie is as bad as the others. Aka the movies should be about the robots not the humiez
Me neither, RaZor. But with the show coming out here in a couple of days... hopefully...
Need to check Toys 'R' Us next time I'm in town
I had to choose between Dash or Pinkie, then I figured Dash was about 20% cooler so yeah
fuck moviebob
I'd get a toy but the Applejack ones suck
@dari I watched the 10 hour video of nyan cat followed by the 10 hour Caramelldansen repeat once. It was an odd day
that guy is awful
/me 8needs Dash related merchandise badly
LOL RainBroDash.
/me will order any MLP merchandise online.
it's my favorite of the three thus far
Then again to me these movies are the equivalent of TF2: ignore the excuse plot, watch for the fun
Moviebob's review came out?
Hipster_Brony: Same
yeah
what happened with Colgate
on friday
It's Time.
If someone asks me if I'm buying it for my sister or something, then I'll just look them straight in the eye and say "No"
it's 2
*dances*
good on you RaZor :P
Must have missed due to BMN (not a bad thing though, hehhehheh)
Sol, he trashes it as much as he did the others.
This video, who made it?
Razor you had better
God, I had this on for 20 minutes a few hours ago..!
Hipster_Brony: I got a good one ogg eBay. See if you can get one at a decent price.
RaZor is officially 20% cooler than me
off*
It also gave me a badass idea for a game, too bad I can't make games
Kespainify made this video, I think.
Dash squeak is why this song is awesome

Starflier: Not intentionally
4It's my job to be here

Isn't this a Micheal Bay film?
11There's no wind either.
Could we discuss some stuff after the film?
Silverscreen all is goood <3
/me hugs back~
Something wrong, dari?
^
We are awesome that way, Bjornfot.
like what?
This clip is questioning our intelligence!
it's a cultural thing, some people decided it'd be a good idea and eventually it got to the point where people just don't want to disappoint their parents and shit
?
we can discuss during
I love his disaster movies though 2012 needs improvement.
Nah, just want to talk about getting a website up among other things.
6SOUND RAPE
Omg Loud OST is loud
Ah
So what the heck are we watching now?
Ghosties I'm sorry dude, accept my brohoof and apology my 'murrican brethren?
0potatojack... that's exactly what i'm talking about. i'm facehoofing so hard
Poor sound quality =/= Ear rape.
rofl this song
O.O SETI
EPIC SOGN ALERT
yeah, i can do that
why so silent suddenly?
4*brohoof, my fine fellow who lives across the pond*
They are supposed to have lost funding
I love this song.
Oh guys, this is something I just randomly thought up the other day...
4All is fine now
:)
BUT does it need to be an Asian?
I think SETI was originally defunded.
Yo bronies, what movie is this
Worldend
/me brohoofs Ghosties
This movie needed more fish
4Except that we're all gonna die in a while
4You know
niiiice haircut
4Will Smith and all
Black people can't can't be signals analysts
Is that some Uncle Phil?
HAHA
If the spaceships had made it that close already SETI wouldn't really be doing it's job.
fucking woll smoth
what could that possibly mean to him
We are a whole nation of Rainbow Dashs, for better or worse.
I was thinking once we're really up and running, like, full staff of mods and whatnot, we should do a classic movie month, with a single movie each day. We'd still be able to do our regular streams too.
"beep beep beep beep"
4Holy fuck, HTWT is right
"OH GOD"
4It's WHITE Uncle Phil
What is the movie´s name?
0IT'S FROM EQUESTRIA
Niiiice coordination.
So bald + grey beard = Uncle Phil?
4Golden days?
We had golden days?
11Yes, golden days.
news to me.
that would be interesting
Silverscreen: Mother fucking agreed.
Well, that's their fault if they thought separating from Britain was a good idea
What golden days?
The 90's
Silverscreen gained 5000 reputation with Starflier, but lost 9999 reputation with the united states government
4You know
Silverscreen I agree
6Also, inb4 SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
I thought that was the 1960s
might be hard during the school year though
Yeah.
4When we were trying to establish ourselves and all that?
Space, must go to space... I love space
The 80s
8inb4 moonbase alpha
It's a space station
everyone, look at the blinking lights!
I'm here everypony, you can commence worshipping me now.
AEIOU
AEIOU
AEIOU
SHHHH
That's no moon
This is something WAY long term I'm thinking.
silverscreen I refuse to think about the state of the world, it gets me really worked up about life and how inappropriately a lot of people live theirs, forever screwing everyone else over
...Duh, cause we ARE
WHOA, ROBERT LOGGIA
USA now needs another revolution.
Like... this time next year, hopefully.
4"If this isn't a beautiful woman..." "JOHN, IT'S ME"
Bjorn, I don't think I'm better than anyone.
Meh, generalising like that is a bit unfair Bjornfot.
4"UH, UH, FIRST LADY"
They need an egoboost to even wake up in the morning. That's why.
Ew
Some people probably do that, but a lot also don't.
4back
11RainBroDash: And that's why the concept of bronies is so special It shows that small percent that isn't like the rest.
4that took longer than expected
Hahaha, a white president
02!shipping
Arguing over the internet is like running the special olympics, even if you win you are still retarded!
4Can you imagine a white president?
4Pfft
OOOOO!!!
8wait, white president in a disaster day?
11A WHITE PRESIDENT?! STOP THE PRESSES!
My stream just derped; had to reload, and it says my nickname is already in use, this makes me a sad pony.

0because of movies like this, aishimasho
Do you realize many of us laugh at the Europeans for their violence and riots over soccer? That doesn't apply to every European though
8what the fuck was i typing
Yeah yeah and "opinions are like asshole"
WHERE'S OBAMA?
"give 110%"
WE NEED A BLACK PRESIDENT.
hipster_brony lolidunno.jpg
"I don't so mondays"
6You should be able to nickchange back to your regular name, RenegadeBrony1
*do* lol I can't type
Too much COMPIMISE!
...Compimse
A single movie each day?
...
Yeah.
That's kinda pushing it, don't you think?
If you DC on IRC, sometimes your nick stays connected, because the server usually checks that you are still connected every 120 seconds.
So you judge a culture by it's entertainment media? That doesn't sound like a flawed methodology at all
Enough politics, let's start blowing crap up.
For the people in school in all
Booohm
Again, WAY down the line.
Get The Doctor!
0It's Luna coming home!
NOW the shits starts cookin.... and i don't mean the movie
So in that time your nick should disconnect.
Like myself
11PotatoJack: Agreed.
And during this time of year.
Thanks, I don't what happened.
FIRE IN SPACE
We need Space Squids to unite The World
dat audiorape
BOOSH!!
Ear rape.
Or if you have registered your nick you can use the ghost command to kill it.
And then, three nuclear blasts happened
Well, how many mods are you talking about?
Those wave peaks
A full staff.
And a full staff is?
11That's chaos theory.
i'd rather not think about it
who's that actor again?
HEY! Isn´t that the guy from Jurassic Park?!
Iunno. I was thinking probably around 20 total.
11Jeff Goldbloom.
Damn, that's quite a lot
Jeff Goldblum
...
yeah. he failed in j-park
Satellites have hydrazine in them, it's nasty stuff.
It is.
Darn, was close
actually, he
um uhhh umm Jeff Goldblum
But expansion is good.
he'S a horrible actor most of the time
in general
And obviously I don't expect to need them all at once.
sry i just came in
Checkmate o3o
lets not get ahead of ourselves right now
wats this movie
So, NC?
For one, we'd have to have quite a bit of half-ops considering Bristle, and Peanut don't ever really make it to the streams or meetings that much
You're a fucking psycho, Jeff Goldblum.
whats this movie calleddddddddddd
Ah yes, haha, I rock! I do have to admit I liked him in the jurassic park movies, and even more in the book
Well, I'm counting half-ops in that.
that voice XD
Also
My nephew got his hand stuck behind my bed :D!!!
I'm Harvey Fierstein and I'm the gay stereotype
dude, that was the most horrible acting performance i ever saw
that voice is the best voice
Harvey Fierstein?
I think we should have shown The Patriot instead
He sounds like the short dude from Mulan
BIKING IN OFFICE, DISREGARD SAFETY REGULATIONS
o hai guiz
11the-the-the way you, way you impersonate Jeff Goldblum, you see, you SEE, is to repeat and stutter on words, words, and give the wrong emphasis on CERTAIN words as-as well.
I SMOKED A THOUSAND MARLBOROS!
It's the guy from Mulan!
Hmmm
Maybe we can just show it for the next 4th of July
R-e-c-y-c-l-e recycle.
Wow, it is?
