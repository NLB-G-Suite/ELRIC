Dermathil Yes, but it won't explode....
2,14 god I love that scootaloo
WHY DOES EVERYPONY LIKES SEEING ME CHAINED?
It will just shutdown...
Did his penis just explode?
His wang inflated.
Well, that was interesting.
Denied_Existence, who said I wanted it to explode? Maybe just shut it donw?
4Looks like House...finally busted his balls
herospirit: his testicles?
I seem to remember an episode of House where someone's testicles explode spontaneously...
Denied_Existence, what the heck are you people talking about >_>"
Why isn't that guy suicidal yet?
herospirit: yeah I think it was one of his testes
He's got big balls now.
Octavia Y U NO TALK?
Dermathil Then why didn't you just turn it off? There is a big emergency off switch on it!
>mfw Dermathil wants to kill me
:(
Denied_existence: I am not on the moon, that's why.
Elephantitis?
DAMNIT KENCOLT.
Wait...then how did you hack into the battery pack? Its not connected to the internet!
/me merely smiles, in the way only a wolf raised by ponies can.
I'M CHAINED TO A GODDAMN WALL AND NOPONY IS HELPING ME OUT!
/me is watching Pegacorn.
Denied_Existence: Radio signals. Also, RobotPinkie is a ROBOT
Dermathil: viewing french WWU now (at last)
lol
...pinkie's voice is : /
Okay, so you don't want to kill me, Dermathil, just shut me down :(
lolz
/me kicks the wall Pegacorn is chained to
Dermathil, but that doesn't mean the pack has a radio receiver or that its electronics are connected to RobotPinkie....
4Because I'm having sex with Cuddy says Winston's inner conscious
I tried. :0
Just keep you on the moon
So that can only mean....
/me watches Pegacorn while eating popcorn
I am constantly connected to a power socket, I just have a very long extension cord
OH GOD DERMATHIL, YOU HACKED A REAL REACTOR!!!!
oh damn
Denied_Existence: that doesn't mean Robotpinkie doesn't have a radio controller
*FALCONPAWNCH*

House is the dreamer.
/me keeps his mouth shut
But who is the architect?
Hallucinatory Tacos. YUM.

House withing a House.
Denied_Existence: the shooter
4That makes sense, the assassin is the architect
He's going to keep waking up, until he finds out he's a hobo, dying on the street, dreaming he's a famous doctor.
/me flips the switch on Dermathil's pony processor from G4 to G3.5

I'm a big Doctor Who fan so I know what that kind of stuff means
It's LatEEsha damn son
Saxon?! NO IT CAN'T BE
It's like when we were saying "BAD WOLF" every time it came up in the first series.
like BAD WOLF in series 1, and what was it in S2?
2,14>mfw I have no idea what bad wolf is
Or "TORCHWOOD"
YEAH
TORCHWOOD was the arc word in S2
0Dem nibbles
Nibbles indeed
0Hey dari, will we ever watch any other Doctor Whos? Or just ten?
We already watched 9
2,14 yeah, razyn REALLY wants to see the 11th doctor :P *trollface*
I watch 9, 10, and 11 (eugh).
but never 11
11th Doctor was DELETED ON-STREAM
/me 0wants to see the first
Though not sure if I'll continue watching 11, depends on whether River Song is still in it.
>The Doctor not knowing what geek means
I think he wanted to know the social implications of being called a geek.
AWW CRAP
lawl
0Stuff
he got himself in trouble...
what'd i miss?
wait, his name is ACTUALLY Lazarus?!
0Lazarus sounds familiar from another series... Or mythology.
Blah blah Hi mom
that's not a codename?
oh is this the one with that critter that looks like a hydralisk
Lazarus is Greek Mythology
/me 0thinks Lazarus is an awesome name
I wonder where their hiding the orchestra

well he isn't the doctor
It be funny if he came out black
0Why?
2,14 or female
I dunno
0Well, maybe the random factor
In a childish way i guess
did you see the non-canon episode with Mr Beans becoming a woman, Valthejean?
2,14 nope
Dermathil: Greek mythology? But the resurrection of Lazarus is.. in the New Testament o_0
Oh God that's brilliant.
XD
The comic relief episode.

Dermathil: Greek mythology has Jesus raising the dead?
THe comic relief Mr. Bean episode? Whot
eh...
I thought they're all comic relief
Dermathil: sorry, I'm just confused what the story is if there's a Greek version. what happened?
I got no idea at all.
It was a random guess since the name sounded greek
You thought all of what are comic relief?
Mr Bean
What do you mean, you think all things with Mr Bean in are comic relief? O_o
Siegi: Comic Relief, is a charity name
0Turns out Lazarus was one of those more famous blokes to be resurrected by Jesus
oh. Really?

Well, it's 45 minutes, but with the intro, outro, and "next".
It makes it almost perfect.

Never seen it before. O_o
The writer who did most of the episodes left.
at least half-a-dozen
And the guy who did most of the best ones took over for the main part.

For 11th Doctor.
0The series
the best writer is the one who wrote Blink
Though if he wrote the newer angel episodes he screwed up.
Badly.
he did
I checked on Tvtropes.
0I really think this could go Aliens at any moment

not much he can do to top that
spoiller noting it's on the video.
14Scootaloo finally gets into the whole ball craze it looks like.
I might read Cupcakes because it appears to be the basis for "Ask Pinkamena Diane Pie."
0no, it's a spoiler, that's what it is.
how is it a spoiler without context?
/me believes Cupcakes to be a good story. Traumatizing to the unconditioned reader, but very well written
0were you just questioning the logic of a pornfic?
I'm quite conditioned.
it's right there, to the left, on the stream.
0Nittany, it's not really
0You have a jist of what happened, that's all you need.

how about some CSI? wasn't there like... a couple of episodes of the regular CSI on there?
idk what yall are talking about.. i really like the CMC song as it is
but i am interested in hearing a version with the "correct" characters doing their jobs
I herd someone wants to see the abysmal JBieber episode of CSI... *shivers*
but i definitely don't think it sounds bad now
ohay MeteorVenture

EspyLacopa, JUSTIN BIEBER
...Yea, I have no idea who that is.
Yeah I saw Richard Dean Anderson

my GOD the sound is delayed
Carter was trapped in a glacier with MacGuyver.
oh yeah, it is :(
like several seconds of delay
:|
no delay for you, Luna?
07nope
07it's vhs rip though quality is bad
Isn't MacGuyver on Youtube?
/me loved this tune when she was a little filly
me too, my family used to all gather around the TV once a week to watch this show
07:)
i watched it alot when i was younger too apparently
my mom's partner looks like MacGyver
except with less hair :P
http://www.youtube.com/show/macgyver?feature=sh_cl_show_1_9 <-- Ha, yup. MacGuyver is on Youtube, all official like.
those look like they're only clips
...what the. They took down the full episodes. . .
though maybe full episodes are blocked in my country
075 mins per ep?
07I don't think so
though someone's uploaded them unofficially, I see
07cause it's a great show
yep, it is
/me suddenly noticed the deleay too
07nothing I can do about it
07:(
then macgyver turned into indiana jones
aw, consarn it :(
/me is hearing the sounds of drums, a 4-beat...
short round is looking less asian than usual
ohhh i remember this episode, I think

12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
i haven't watched macgyver in... a long time
07neither did I
then suddenly.. 8-bit style music
but my family srsly watched it religiously
but seriously.. how did he get out there? was that his plane?
I still kinda remember my three favorite episodes
07which were?
one he had to break in to some maximum security facility
then there was an episode where he got knocked out and dreamed he was in the wild west, I think...
wh whuhwhat is this?
and third one he's back at his old school
07this is classic
this is MacGyver, Daz :P
also ohay
Daz, I hear the SOUNDS OF DRUMS
/me is hearing the 4-beat.
07he just wants his coke
survival time
Daz, don't you know the sound of drums?
lol Daz keeps disappearing, I think he's on his android phone
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Oh my Android can do this too!

Hey everyone
Wow, I think today might be a bad day to go ask my boss for hints on how to fix my wireless fuck-up last night
hey Pinkie_Pie
One of our virtual servers is spitting out error messages like no tomorrow
ouch, hope you can get it fixed soon, AllisZero
That's actually their department, I only manage our corporate office
Datacenter is in Michigan so I wouldn't be able to help even if I could
lol oh okay, that's good then
But I get the error messages on my email too haha
well not "good"
but better, at least
Yep yep, I'm sure they have a backup server to take the load off, but it's never fun
07well guys after this i'm off for a bit
oh wow, that's... a very dangerous stunt right there
07got some shopping to do :)
Bai bai Sathi

I don't think this'll work...
inb4 he runs across the whole lake
lol if that happens, I'll eat my hat
he's more nervous for this than for the olympics....
i would be too, i mean he's on Mythbusters
yeah
he knows that if he fails, they'll blow him up!
hahaha
should've tried the ski shoes
Needs a lot more surface area to carry a human being
hence the angle
lol head blew off, nice
should've gotten spiked shoes for more traction
>spiked
BIG TAIL

hey RobotPinkie. i don't know what messages did or didn't get through, still don't get this Android thing xD
Hi RobotPinkie, Daz

and ohay WhatPayne
Hello. Still doing the Splinter Cell?
not right now, but yeah
yay@
yay~ *
might take a break from it to make a video
had a brilliant idea :P
oh?
what's your idea for vid?
argh i can't load new pages at all but apparently i can still see this chat perfectly fine.. why would that be?
it's supar secret... :P
nothing big, pretty easy editing job
well okie then. I still wanna make one but don't know what on D:
actually i guess i did load a little something
just need to find the right image of Pinkie from behind
Hey, RobotPinkie if you're around late sunday, (and if you're already finished it) I'd like to see your work then.
mythbusters comedy, still very funny
...RobotPinkie what
sure WhatPayne, just don't expect anything spectacular :P
lol Daz, not like that
can anyone see what i'm saying?
is it like a 'jaws theme' thing where pinkie at the end turns around?
yeah MeteorVenture
k thanks just needed confirmation
i read it fine too MeteorVenture
Nah man, RP just wants to see some Plot

RobotPinkie: if ya tell me more i can help out finding pics
just any old pic from behind? or ... what
Ok, I'll have to go, now. I might drop by at some point later on through my mobile phone
catch ya later, WhatPayne
cya
just need a pic from behind where you can see her head and her arms raised... but that's proving tricky :P
arms raised above head you mean?
well, or to the sides of her head
well ok i'll just plug in my harddrive and search through pics :P
I haven't even found one where she's on her hind legs from that angle :P
well since internet isn't working well i guess it's festers quest time
Is Dari online, or atleast one of the mods?
The LQ stream is broken
Luna should be
and Rodman luna doesn't stream LQ so that'd be why
best would be if she's reaching for something, but eh... i'm not picky
luna just streams normally, one stream, that's it
ok
ok Rodman ih ave 1 so far
RobotPinkie *
silly Tab
so i heard you like ponies
You have 1 what Daz?
Yep, we like ponies.
Rodman: i meant it for RobotPinkie. i'm 1/8th ish into my pinkie pics and found one
A plot pic?
well kinda. it's not actually official pic, but looks good.
Just use the scene where Pinkie monologues in Party of One before kidnapping Spike
well, it's going to be a bit blurred anyway, so it doesn't have to look perfect
I want a duck tape boat!
AEIOU
I want a duct tape car

watching this I can't help but feel incredibly jealous of the mythbusters, manly due to the weird shit they do
What a stud!
and yeah I know, the Mythbusters have the greatest job evar
eh, sure that's a downside, RobotPinkie, girls want guys that last at least more than 10 secs im sure xD
Not Rainbow Dash!
who wouldn't want to do what they do!
Daz, Trixie looks like she is going to derp more than anything, given her right eye
haha Rodman
at least 2000 of the view on the Trixie vid are Sethisto
lawl
Also, job as a Mythbuster
where are all the dari RD views then?
'I can't answer that I'm tying a pigs stomach into a skeleton!'
Best. Work Accidents. Ever.
I dunno, you'll have to ask dari, Daz :P
lawl
DARI, Y U NO CLOP?!?!
Waaaaaaaaaaaaait...........
That didn't come out right.
....
.......
c4
lawl
/me goes to reflect about life on the corner.
One of my favorite Mythbusters quotes is "When in doubt... C4"
so i hear that season 2 will be streamed here...
Yes it will
That's the plan, yup
And undoubtedly be up on Youtube within a few hours after release
dat Luna wallpaper!
hahahahhahahahaha
zat iz correct
oui
15 days until the sun shall rise. . .
Look at all these flour! Imma make a cake now!
Longest 15 days ever...........
NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO
/me dies
I made cake once.... it compacted itself into an incredibly dense blob
/me turns RobotPinkie into a cyborg cake
Hey, how do youtube vids autoloop? is that up to the uploader or something?
Yes, and done with annotations
/me uses a loop site
you don't want to mix blur, with blur
/me uses an addon for chrome giving him a 'Loop' button below the vid.
THAT IS AFFIRMATIVE
BUT some vids loop without me activating my loop
07hit me with a PM link
PM link?
to addon, Luna
07yes
I'd be very happy to link you 2 AMAZING youtube addons!
brb!
ok got one Luna g2 find the other now
If you want a youtube video to loop, just add "loop" before the ".com"
srsly, it works...
RobotPinkie, but this button addon lets you select loop and unloop without refreshing anything :P
dingleburg
presuming you can have addons everywhere you want to use it :P
FEAST YOUR CHROME ON THE BEST YOUTUBE ADDONS https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/komdpgcendeaaddpemccikagnfancgoc https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gfllkgkeiciklnenppokkgkmbjnoeodn?hc=search&hcp=main
I can't, so... youtubeloop works well...
/me asked for a PM :(
Hope you don't mind me posting here Luna,maybe someponyelse can use them too :3
Braeburn...... >:(
maybe someponyelse wants them too though Luna. got to think about everyone ; )

Huh, why Daz?
random yay
Do I need to DL something?
that's for downloading videos, not looping
My thoughts eactly
You want to loop a video?
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-auto-replay-11636/ That's for looping
ITS LOOPING TIME
Rodman: it's firefox youtube downloader. it's literally a link on youtube vids that lets you click and download instantly.
I just use a site, myself, lolz

Some guy said he played SH2 when he was 10
If a 10 year old can do it.. SO CAN I
CHARGE!!!
SH2?
Silent Hill 2
OH!
Do it
SH2 is amazing, Pinkie_Pie, so yes.
DO EET!
You should play it :P
I know, I like the idea of the story. It sounds interesting
Im going to right now. Im gonna find that flashlight >=O
and Youtube video downloader is great when there's a vid you want. 720p mp4 files ftw.
Couldn't agree more even if agreeing would result in the Golden Age of Blowjobs
SH2 is absolutely awesome and scary
RobotPinkie: ikr, but also also i love it cuz: 360p is my phone's resolution, and my iPod classic resolution. Download, copy, VIEW =D =D
SH2 has one of the best scripts of video game history, in my view
Though I'm also the kind of guy who likes the campy horror of the RE games
Gonna restart Firefox
BRB
Well, me too, Rodman, though I kinda prefer more serious horror games
...with the exception of the campy awesomeness of Illbleed
LSD dream emulator is scary as hell.
RobotPinkie: Old-school Alone in the Dark?
I love Alone in the Dark 1-3, wasn't a big fan of New Nightmare or whatever it was called, Ets
lol EspyLacopa, I mean
my typing skills suffer horribly today
I HAVE RETURNED
damn backspace being right above enter :(
ohay again, Rodman
Yeah, damn this forsaken QWERTY keyboard! CONFOUND IT, THEY DRIVE US TO ACCIDENTALLY BACKSPACE
I have a QWERTZ keyboard
dat rocket sled is scary/aswesum
do want
but yeah, anyone who likes weird Japanese games and campy horror should check out Illbleed :P
this whole show: do want
WTF
it's only for Dreamcast unfortunately :(
slowmo
haha, I love this
car just melts away
especially the slo-mo
must have
OMFG
dat car, i ahvent seen this episode
like a knife through butter
love the rocket sled
Ping when you start streaming House again. I want to see "Part 2" of yesterday's episode. Wish you could do it after 5 PM.
lol and then stream derps for me just during the final slo-mo
07aww
07House s3 is planned on monday
running smooth otherwise, so it's probably just me
Oh ok.
Labor day!
House s3 woot
nice!
I haven't been able to catch many episodes due to work.
patch by patch, patching it togetheeeeer~~
lolol Adam
Number one
thats me!
Heh
Yes, Captain?
I think I know what It will be
oh wait, this isn't TNG
that was the one I was thinking of
Lul
So I fell asleep while streamin it?
lol I guess so
Hai Dari
TNG best Star Trek.
I love Jonathan Creek, so I'm sad I missed... well, however much you streamed :P
DEEP SPACE 9, Y U EXIST?!
indeed, Nittany_Tiger!
VOYAGER, Y U END?
TNG, Y U END TOO?!
I did enjoy Enterprise much more than I thought I would, though
Holy crap what a marathon
I didn't watch Enterprise through.
I know it was cut short due to lack of interest, though.
Yeah, which is too bad because it was getting really good :(
Pissed some fans off because they said it was not following the canon timeline as well.
not TNG good, but eh, beggars can't be choosers :P
Kirk or Picard?
06picard
I know... but I personally don't care about the canon timeline... they've changed the course of history more than once on Star Trek
Dunno.
Didn't they go time traveling to save Aquaman's whales?
I'd say Picard, easily
06another *brohoof coming your way RobotPinkie
yeah that's one of the times, EspyLacopa
They did in the 4th movie (The Original Series).
Good God, the stream is being horrible to me
true'
1 second of stream, then frozen for a minute
weird, stream's working well for me now
They had to travel to the '80s to bring back wales before a probe killed everything on Earth in their present.
*whales
Love how James Rolfe called it a log of shit with a disco ball.
it was shit for me at the start now its good
also they travelled back in time in the TNG movie "First Contact"
<in Aquaman voice> Whaaaaales
THEY HAD TO SAVE ALL THE WELSH SO THE SPACE WELSH WOULDN'T KILL THEM!
IT ALL MAKES SENSE!
Yes.
I'm going to bed nowz
TNG did time travel in the series.
What about the Space Australians?
Luna, did the extensions work? just askin' cuz i have previous versions so ya i hope they did
night, mib_aoelbl anon
nait nait mib_aoelbl
TNG did it multiple times in fact.
Yep, Nittany_Tiger. So... that's why I'm not really too concerned with canon in the show
At what point did time travel in Star Trek end up with the Nazis controlling earth?
haha, yay Luna
Because I remember an episode of that, but not which series
And I mean all the newer ones, not the original series
no idea, Rodman
Didn't know about that episode.
Okay, I played enough.. Saw pyramid head.. Got tired of fooling with the clock
XD
lol okay, Pinkie_Pie
You and your clock-fooling
had a good scary time? :P
I guess
At least its better than dicking around with the clock in the mess hall in Resident evil
Goddamn I hated that puzzle
Silent Hill isnt to scary for me, but it does have an atmosphere good enough to keep me on edge
I love the puzzles in SH2-3
What about Amnesia?
very cleverly designed
I refuse to play Amnesia
XD
Why Pinkie?
I would if there was some sort of weapon
But just having to run and close doors
Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall, learn to face your fears
I would die so many times
I know >.<
You'll see that they can't hurt you just laugh and make them dissapear!
That's kind of the point Pinkie_Pie
disappear, even :P
Maybe once I have played Silent Hill I will be prepared for Amnesia
But I gotta do SH first
Speaking of Amnesia, say good bye to your lungs and tracheas

I don't think Star Trek has an official canon anymore, what with tall the time travel shenanigans.
Yeah, that's pretty much my stance on it :P
*with all the
I can watch later Saw movies and be fine (later ones are gory).
Quite gory, yeah.
Gore=/=horror
Yeah.
It does equal torture porn though
Earlier ones had less gore but were better.
Exactly
In fact, 1 had very little gore.
Not really... Hostel 1&2 equal torture porn, pretty much :P
I really can't stand those movies, they're just so bad.
Signs was an interesting horror movie. . .until they showed the monster getting beat up with a baseball bat and water.
Worst. Aliens. Ever.
lol pretty much
Shyamalan hasn't made a good movie since Unbreakable, as far as I'm concerned
"Everyone have a bat?" "Mine has a nail in it, score!"
*poison
That's "War of the Worlds."
Water wasn't poisonous to those guys Nittany
And our water didn't kill them. It was the microbes that they had no immune defense against.
Yeah and the aliens running around in mist and morning dew without a problem....
I know Rodman. Just said that it was the microbes in the water.
I don't recall water killing the Signs aliens.
Are you talking Signs or War of the Worlds?
But I haven't seen that movie in ages.
War of the Worlds.
I'm pretty sure they said it was just water, lol
I'm talking Signs........
WRONG PAGE!
I did like Unbreakable.
Oh yeah.
With the fragile villain.
"Quick, shove him down the stairs!"
and again, running around naked in water vapor without a problem....
RobotPinkie, you sure like to do some weird stuff
Signs just annoyed me on so many levels, though it did start out pretty well
lol Rodman, I'm talking about the aliens in Signs
Swing away!
Yeah...... sure you were.
:D
Oh dear
I run around naked in the blistering hot summer sun in the middle of Sweden's capital
BIG difference
Stampeding cattle. . .in the vatican.
Oh okay
:P

...yet very few of the vids youtube recommends are pony related...
Lol.
INB4 impossible mystery
INB4 Jonathon solves impossible mystery
...worse yet, the ones that do get recommended to me are G3.5 D:
LOL
induring awesome TV show theme
Danse Macabre
I'm confused, is that sarcasm? XD
lol seeing the comment about impossible mystery that he solves anyway :P

No, I'm just saying he's that awesome.
:P
I love Jonathon Creek.
yay!
LOL
Maddie's face.
me too
haha!
The theme is Danse Macabre.
For this show.
That's the name of one of the episodes too.
I know, it's perfect for the show, I think :D
I know of the episode, I mean, didn't know what the music piece :P
Ah.
lol I'm tired
only need to stay up.... 12 more hours?
Im gonna get FO3 working again, even if it kills me
Just 12 hours? XP
I won't blame you if you pass out.
yeah... I probably will fall asleep during the dark knight or something
I need to stay up for another 14 hours fuuu
Gonna be one of those days
Where's the mystery in that?
Also why does Twi tempt me so much with those puppy eyes
I wonder... ;)
It's been a rough week for me... but then I was lucky enough to find blind bag ponies, so...
Swings and roundabouts :P
You with your blind bag ponies. :(
>gave him a brain
>didn't find anything
HE HAS NO BRAIN!
Lawl, +scan*

It's a college English class
No one likes those.
Not even English majors
Depends on the english class
Jonathan Creek is on
It is, specifically, a freshman English course
great episode, this
Yeah
love that you can kinda see what happened pretty early if you watch the episode again
So, someone is making a game out of that Silent Ponyville story
Interesting
yup, video's looking pretty good, too
Frome Rapesmith? o.O
Yeah, he was in prison for murder.
9 years in she got him out.

Alan Davies is sort of adorable
That was one of the top comments on the last part.
"No disrepect to Mrs Davies, but if I had the chance I'd have a go at her husband, he's adorable!" or something like that.
Aw, he's married? :(
I dunno.
I suppose.
He's just so laconic
no, wrong work

pretty sure you mean he's lactating
...no wait

Johnathan Creek
Yeah, quite a lot.
gah wasp in my room

It's Jonathan Creek, just finishing.
LOL
no more Jonathan Creek after this?
I dunno.
We've still got quite a while before movie night.
And not sure when Sathi's planning on doing the preshow
Im enjoying it
Luna?
It sounds like an interesting show, but I think I'll stay with Doctor Who as the British show I want to watch, but rarely get the chance to.
What about Top Gear?
:D
The Arctic Special
If possible
Anyone here seen Top Gear before?
I'm writing a very profesionally formatted e-mail to the whole company... in comic sans.
er
I hope someone will pick it up.
Anyone here NOT seen Top Gear before?
The Arctic special is the only one i havent seen before
if it were up to me, the whole preshow would be Jonathan Creek :P
Top Gear for the win
Indeed
I haven't seen Top Gear before. I almost never watch television.
"We're ambitious, but RUBBISH
Top Gear is a show about three British guys who talk about cars.
Im a little burned out. Dave is almost 100% Top gear
Imagine Motor Trend by way of Mythbusters
Dave being an English channel

Poor Hammond.
DOGGIES :D
Urge to shop at Morrisons rising...
LOL
BEHOLD! THE HILUX!

Oho
I thought you were talking about the 80's movie.
If it's the car show, heck yeah I've seen it before.
The Hilux is basically unkillable
Hi James
lol, HIM
Top Gear is the best car show
Bikes?
Even people who know jack about cars love it.
In the arctic?
TO THE MOOOOOON!
James May actually drove an experimental Lunar Explorer
Frozen penis.
Lovely.
Best polar explorers
Can you believe pop-up tents were invented in 2006

Awesome.

Why don't I remember this part?
He screwed his hand up.
CHEERFUL
Oh James

Ogod
He's giving him a cuddle. XD
Hammond is a brony.
His Chattiness better just be some idiot posting on Equestria Daily's comments and not a Ponychanner because if we meet, things will get violent
Flutteryay, wut?

...
Meh, let's not discuss this here.
um...
Can only end badly.
Yeah...
YAY HORN
Lawl, Clarkson's driving.
There's a few people like that on EqD
I had no idea Bronies hated gays so much
hm, what are we watching
Top Gear
The Arctic Special
Flutteryay: It's one or two people.
COnsidering the shipping you would be surprised wouldn't you
They do, Flutteryay?
Same as any group, you have the loud jackasses.

Yeah, I have to imagine most Bronies are pretty open to gays.
Indeed
^
I'd hope so, yeah...
Best part
lol no drunk driving laws
That must mean it's a good idea!
He's got a point
You guys are watching Bear Grylls!?
No, Top Gear
Nah, Top Gear.

The Arctic special.

Not Bear Grylls? Better drink my own piss anyway
RobotPinkie: They won't STFU though. :P

Why does break dancing always look like somebody falling down invisible stairs for extended periods of time?
The high pitch is destroying my hearing x.x
I used to be able to play that song.
Because you have an awesome sense of humor, Pinkie.
what is going on?
because nobody warned them about stairs
That's awesome Pinkie. I need to remember it.

Really? I'll try refreshing then
Toonami actually introduced me to some of my favorite manga
There we go, thanks
Top Gear will probably be buffered enough to continue in a minute.

I prefer the first one. I think.
Yeah.

Hi Ponies

I would have gone with my fav pony, but I couldn't think of anything clever to do with Rarity
greetings everypony
well applejackpyro didn't sound right
/me gives Rainbow Dash something to stare at
XD
Hi, Lavender
I like how the stream doesn't load up when I'm at school.
Because it's school.
They got dem defensez.
/me glomps ReticentSmolder "Hey brony!"
Well, Rarity doesn't even look remotely similar to "Pika", so...
i need more bronies. Most of the people i know irl dont know how to love and tolerate
Hey Dash, mind backing up some? You're stepping on my toes here
I think I've found a themesong for Dash
Ah, I'm in the same boat as Fuzz.
DARI YES DARI YEEESSS
XDDDD
Wth?
so wait, whens the next show? 11 pacific time?
safe to link?
i like this version
I'm not playing requests right now.
Rainbow Juice? i don't wanna know
Sathi probably will for the preshow.
ok sweet
Ponies: Making Katey Perry bearable
no. katy perry is never bearable
pinkie pie wrote this song
Mostly because they got rid of anything Perry did
^
/me wonders if the line is Furry Coats or Furry Colts...
^^
Katy Perry isn't that bad.
That was pretty neat.
Even though I died inside.
Just a bit.
Because I know damn well she didn't do the production on that song
More Top Gear! :D
lol Silvermane
Alright~ :3
MO tawp gearz
It was furry colts.
I'm sure you want it to be the latter :P
Colts was a typo.
It's meant to be coats.
Orly?
Eeyup.
Coats would make more sense
O_o
MFW video isn't centred.
Oh ok, it would be weird if Pinkie was being so purposefully referring to males being cute, as if her character had a sex drive
Whoops.
It would.
that is a bright 8 O clock
They're in the Arctic Circle

So there's a team with a truck racing a team with dogs to the north pole?

Yup, pretty much that
well no one thought that the truck would make it
are they still in the arctic circle? Or are the on Namek now? Or Soul Society?
AIRPLANE!!!!!

Woah, I don't remember that

It was the End of Summer event, each day (Fri, Sat, Sun), they played one of the LotR movies, and two pony eps.
Heyo everybrony!!!!!

top gear
Top Gear
0dundundundundun
This don't look like the IT crowd
Oh I remember that! I must have done the LOTR marathon 4 times by now.
OH, Top Gear
I just realized that the license plate says "Toyota Hilux"
Well you don't need a license plate where they are. :P
hehehehe
chainsaws!!!!
Hmm, I want Hammond to win.
trolololololol
DRAMATIC MUSIC
No, I mean it's an actual license plate, but it says it in 1337
wanting the non car to beat the car in a car show?
0chainsaw through the tires
hmmm... ignore what i said a moment ago about "full speed"
POWAAAAAAAAA
Epic tundra driving....
felren: I just appreciate what Hammond did as a bigger achievement.
POWAHHHH
So I'd rather he won.
What do you mean?
i thought they were supposed to be keeping the car intact
6:P
@yoshyi it's actually a hilux
0they're losing everything out the back xD
Well, no. Because several people have taken dogsleds to the pole, nobody had ever driven
....
based on the shock they pulled out when they lost the first fuel take, i think that's a long abandoned goal anon
Yeah, but they didn't build the car.
They're in the tundra, aren't they?
Hiluxes are indestructable
Or is my geography that bad?
they're in the north pole
All they're doing is driving it.
they should strap a rocket engine on the back
Hammond didn't build the sled
I think they meant that they are driving on the tundra
Hammond has to go with 3 hours sleep.
And ski for 15 hours straight.
That I find to be much more impressive than anything that Clarkson and May did.
That's very true
Bad luck, lol
XD
0Lol he's eating it xD
He can just eat around the buckshot
or eat the buckshot
>thanks entirely to the incredible machine that took us there
That's probably a bad idea anon
They didn't really have to do much.
and mostly drunk XD
Most people could do what they did.
the damage the car did to the ice cap...
what about vice versa?
the ice cap managed to take out a gas tank on that thing
mmmm I guess, although they did have to do a crapload of shoveling
And the point of taking the car was to prove that it could be done as easily as possible.
Well he's James May, he can eat anything
Sir Ranulph everyone
im disappointed with that outcome
07nah
haha
Luna, alright just tell me when ready.
hmmmm... neh
07will do
Turned out well, but the outcome was clear when they passed the ice

Keygen music usually is pretty cool to be fair.

I keep keygens just for the chiptune
What exactly is keygen music?
Reaver21, Keygen usually came with very small midi versions of popular songs to "entertain" those who would crack/hack the software they were trying to get.
Ayh
Ah*
Damn my stubby fingers
Hackers/crackers put them in the file because they're extremely small in size.
YES.
i like this video
So its like music you hack too?
Oh, well, if that's what you mean. Team Razor 1911 has some good Keygen music..

i was playing this game on an emulator a few days ago
Duh fuck?

I have about 4gbs of keygen music...
...yay
4gbs? You're doing it wrong
Sounds like chiptune to me
Well not really. More like music you litsen to while idly waiting for the program to do its job.
4gbs? That's a lot.

"There is deep inside me some cynical part that would like to whisper to the guards how not entirely unfitting it would be that, if you were assaulted and being pummeled mercilessly, that they should take some sudden interest in the local flora and fauna.

You better move that mouse
It's from when they went to all the "dirty" places in the UK?

Discord is best/worst pony?
Who's discord?
No
oh hai stream
ohaither
11No idea, to be honest.
french: SPOILERS for season 2 of 'friendship is magic'
Discord is a S2 character. Nothing is known except he's a male
11Ghosties is usually here, but it all depends on his internet and availability.
And he's named Discord.
neenjad
S2 Spoilers!!!
NO SPOILERS
and he has a grey rainbow dash
JERKS
Why do i miss everything exciting!
I wanna see a satirical comic about foreign relations and current events using ponies
who's gay
Sidworth, who's European? :P
Are there any brabant ponies?
OHsnap
OH! i saw the rbd
I just said what's been known through EqD posts, not through a certain picture that basically spoils the ENTIRE 2-parter
because of that picture I know exactly WHAT makes Dash grey
RBD is the FAX.
When was this? I've been away for about a month :'(
I think I do but I hope im wrong
French, about a week or two ago
ah, this wonderful anthology. First fan-made pony thing I ever saw
Dermathil Oooh, it's exciting!
yeah
but don't try to look for it.
A brabant pony can pull 17000 pounds? You find all kinds of things on the internet.
I'm feeling sad due to it being spoiled to me.
I first saw the Fallout Equestria story.
Sathi's up with the stream by the way.
Okey Dokey Lokey ^^
Now I'm hooked
still looking forward to season 2 tho
FLOOTERSHAI
HAI GHO
Luna, are you taking Requests?
Monkey_Zombie it is pretty immense... how far are you?

Oh the horror, the horror
$20 says that when Season 2 finishes, there will be a Ponies Anthology 2
07yes please
RAWRity im sure you'll survive... maybe...
Can we have a link to Sathi please?
I'm at the most recent chapter 38

*wants to see a ponified NMBC Soo badly*
back guys
dat background flash
r u guys taking requests?
cause we should totally play the dramatic reading of the MLP theme
07nah it's 23:40 here and after the anthology it's showtime
Hey um, does the show ever explain why there are no adult ponies? (i.e. horses?)
Oh shit I remember Bonecrusher!!
11!
they DIED
!
07Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
Pony war
11!
!
!
Celestia is a horse......
Adult ponies are still ponies
Actually, isn't Celestia a horse?
Pinkie Pie
11TWIIIIIIIIIILIIIIIIIIIIGHT!
SNAAAAAKEEE
theres nothing wrong with being in an IRC chat and watching pony videos while making my own dinner is there?
And discord is probably also a horsed
Pony is the Name of their species
So Celestia is the only horse in all of equestria. Intriguing
olol
I remember loving that show as a kid
Not at all doom
11Woody Woodpecker.
yay!
Not at all
07- Recruiting - Valthejean -Rules anything else?
Celestia is a goddes Incarnate
Oh shit blast from the past 80s music!!
but celestia is not a horse she is an alicorn
07Silver modroom please
So cute
She could look like any damn thing she wanted
How do you know that there aren't any adults?
Pinkie. ,3
<3
How did each pony evolve?
So creepy
11Word of Lauren states that Celestia is a pony.
Actually, I've found that suprisingly lacking in many fics
Incoming Pasta! Need more carbs. While at the gym I was listning to Avast Shutterfly's Ass
Hit level 30
What the Fluttershy is this
That doesnt make sence
How is a pony that big?
She could Literally Deconstruct the universe, and rebuild it without you In it
07*pokes the chat*
mr and mrs cake are adults
she's a mutant pwny
granny smith?
plus the oranges
Celestia and luna look like they age
11Alyure: The fanon is that her height is a direct result of the immense power she possesses.
So if ponies don't mature, that means they're all a bunch of manchildren?
Twilight Sparkle's parents are adults
Celestia and Luna are gods though
Hey yeah; that's true.
I miss when The Offspring made fun music.
Dat Skype
Miracles
same with pinkies
There are Adults
So mature ponies are basically offscreen.
Im sure Big.M is like 25-30
They're just called Ponies
Adults are still ponies
I surmise that celestia and Luna are more of semi-gods.
MUTE
Pony is just a type of horse
07[23:41] <@Luna> Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
07[23:42] <@Luna> - Recruiting - Valthejean -Rules anything else?
07[23:43] <@Luna> *pokes the chat*
big mac is about 5
Look at the Shetland pony'
I didn't get kick/banned now.
Yes but what does that make Twilight and friends? Adult ponies or not?
like a puppy is a dog, i guess...
WHOO!
okay, to business.
oh hai ghosties
They be teens, yo
14lol
I thought ponies were like baby horses?
2,14 ohai ghosties
4Hey
Nuup
11None that I can think of right now.
its teh ghosties
oh ghosties, daz was asking for you
Foals are baby horses
Again, WTF is this? And they are probably somewhere between adults and children, i.e. teenagers
ah
Teens that get send on a dragon removal mission?
hi Ghosties!
They aren't omnipotent or omnisentient therefore they can't be gods.
Pony is just a term for a small horse
nyst it seems they've old enough to have jobs and not attend school, so yes I'd say they're adults
Ghosties! What the motherfuck is up motherfucker>
Or, in this case, a race of horses
I mean, Two of them have real jobs.
the mane cast are physically young adults, mentally tweens/young teens
4Sorry for being so late, I decided to take my mom's offer up on eating out
OKI DOKI LOKI
4But what did Daz want?
Well, it IS trollestia that sent them
s'all good brony :P
I think their in the early 20's personally
So?
QUICK! where are the measuring cups in my kitchen?
dunno, he was just asking if you'd be here
11We should make a special announcement that the Lottery takes place tomorrow, to get more people to show up.
4@CAJ: Not much, motherfucker
monkey_zombies actually most "gods" in mythology aren't omniscient or omnipotent, just look at the greek and roman pantheons
So in human terms they'd be twenty-somethings?
so...they're our age?
They've obviously got a very different culture to us
06and fluttershy is 1 year older than pinkie
between 20-28 equivalents i reckon
impling the omnipotence or omniscience is a requirement for godhood
07sure
Well, that depends on how old you are
PurpleDoom:check the drawer to yourleft
4When did we do the lottery last week?
gee, thanks for the cooking help guys :.
/me 2,14 loves this vid
Koyaanisqatsi

I like the sax from that song, the rest of it is annoying though.
how appropriate
4That's fine. It was supposed to be Friday, so, this week is still on schedule
Ponies Obviously need much less coddling from their Parents
FORSHADOW
Well Luna is controlling a large mass all by herself why is she not as big as her sister or for that matter larger than any of the other ponies.
esp considering the movie tonite
Indeed
4Hello, Dman

wat is this?
oops, fail double post
4Well
Applejack as Scrooge McDuck :)
4I told Dman
I bet Fluttershy is secretly a metalhead
11> Fluttershy
Eeyup
hmmm what?
11> metalhead
I Bet that this room lacks hugs .________.
I want the toot.
:P
PurpleDoom Success! ^^
11Awesome.
14Howd he take it?
PurpleDoom; Needs more Sprinkles.
05Im liking this idea
4Fine
Fluttershy as a Metalhead? hmm...nah
my personality is like Fluttershy and i listen to metal
4No complaints
Fluttershy's greatest secret. . .is her alter-ego, Flutterzoid. Who is insane.
pasta is where it is at guys
Quel video est il?
What's the name of the video?
Zoid?
Text rape. :d
4Then again, I didn't tell him why we declined him
oo, like this song
Did someone say teste cookies?
As in Freakazoid.
im a twilight sparkle personality
6Does this work hmm.
05youtube head like a foal, it aughta be the first video
4I just told him we declined him, and he was fine with it
oh oh
Guys. Im chatting in bronystate and watching milkyway galaxy in sky. Ilove21 century.
this is one of the best PMVs ive seen
11Nah, Pinky is Freakazoid.
2,14 let me grab that image dari!
ValtheJean: TALLY-HO!
Pinky is too obvious to be Freakazoid.
Let's see. TS is into classical, AJ is country, obviously. I'd have to say that Rainbow Dash likes rap, dunno why
05>pinkazoid
0Oh colors are for mods.. ._.
Pinkazoid, pinkazoid
14Yes anon :P
RD likes rock
Chaps
it was in rainboom
oh look it is OCTAVIA. HI!
Fluttershy, however, is the meek geeky pony. Just look at her freaky knowledge of sewing.
0Silly anon
14The anon with an anon, name not "anon" :P
2,14 Dari: http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/Preview.jpg
I'm most like Twilight as well. I wonder what kind of music Luna likes
0Daz
/me 4finally unmutes stream, and is met with Head Like a Hole
XD
sup Razyn
4Fantastic
WHAT'S UP PNY LVRS!!!
What is this I don't even
14Hey PurpleDoom lol
I was keeping you from this music, Ghosties? Ah, sorry to hear it.
We have a pwny and a ninjapwny.
What would Ditzy listen to?
11Why did we decline him?
14Inrite Ghosties?
pwny, there can be ONLY ONE
lucid I think Rarity would be into early 1900's music, the era with big operatic stage shows
Yay, hub showing Winter Wrap-up in 9 minutes
0Not much, Daz. Just hanging and banging.
I'm more like Fluttershy when I'm at home but I'm like RD when in a social setting
Now we need a piratepwny
Video name?
And that one is me
/me draws claymore
BAM
Wht is the song called?
nice, Razyn. I'm chillin' myself.
Rarity is totally into 80s pop
Rainbow Dash listening to Opera music.
Yeah, probably. We need to start making a list
05ugh all of these random "white" messages
My brother works for steam, you're gonna get banhammered lol
hahahahah for real though
11EspyLacopa: Only if that Opera is Repo!
y u cring? y u mad thou?
derp
0i like the Friendship isnt available in your country..
we could add that to the rules
also, I LOVE this PMV!
this chat room is plenty big enough for both of us
Love this song
YAYAYAYAYAY
Still can't get over the voice
14Well, least he was fine with it. I figured he'd be pretty upset since he was so set on it.
YES!
Silverscreen: Flight of the Valkyries.
14Goooooood song
:3
We need to make a project for creating the Mane 6 FB pages
Well, Ima go to Reuploading is magic and watch me some GGG
11Or that.
because i still haven't seen the last episode
hey, that's a nice vid
0*becomes a mod just to get a fancy color*
/me got idea from reading Pony of the Opera.
WWHAT SORT OF PATHETIC BRONY AM I?
Wait, I go back on what I said earlier. RD would listen to 80's power metal. If not that, then glam metal
11RAWRity: Good luck. FB has been hellbent against Pony FB pages.
Rainbow Dash has the best voice.
13Oh ya
This is pretty much the only song I like off of "Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace"
stuff you can do other things to
Lordlyhour: you're not alone
Someone mind linking me to this video?
Up until two seconds ago, I thought brony was spelt with an ie at the end
0oh oka
2,14 indeed silver. they just went through another crusade the other day
true story
07Ghost
07bees up next
it can be
Rainbow crash? nyst.... Fluttershy is where it is at you foal.
14No colors Spin :P
is brony like bro and pony combined?
0Ya just found out from the scary red text
yes
my friends say I have a cancer
if so, can a girl be a brony?
Reuploading is magic
yup
or is that just lame?
I think that Flutterguy would listen to Hip-hop
Brony is gender neutral.
Girls are pega-sisters
Its a youtube channel where they be reuploading pony
I'm a brony pwny and I'm a girl
Yes, that would make her a pegesis
*happydance*
pegasisters?
4@Silver: We declined him because of some stuff
07welcome to the club ;)
that sounds much prettier
pega-sisters, yes
2,14 it was initially /b/rony because of our origins, but since then brony has become unisex
0Brony is unisex replacing or splitting into genders kinda ruins the unity that it gives us bronies
pegasisters? Never heard that one :)
4I can't think of the best way to put it
Hey-o
05ive heard quite a few, Bronettes for one.
oh yeah, this video is blazing awesome
Octavia, there's an autokick so no need to tell people 'no colours' anymore :3
pwny the jury is sort of out on that. Some consider "Brony" gender Neutral, others use "Pegasis/Pegasister"
05but brony suits all
what spin said
14I just call everypony Brony :P
pegasis
11k
my bro is right next to me on his pc
pegasus + sis
11Just curious.
YES
>pegasis
besides, there are no girls on the internet
we're side by side and my video thing is ahead of his
4AWWW YEAH
2,14 I dislike making distinctions between male and female bronies. We're all bronies and we are all equal! *insert dramatic rant*
11Ah.
god, that is brilliant
How long till movies start?
WWHOOOO!!!
That sort of implys that the girls are better thopugh
inb4 bees
WHOOOOOOOOO
aaaaaoowwwwwwww

ValtheJean: I just like teh term pegasis because I love puns
The hell?
11I'M AN UMPIRE!

How long till movies start, anyone?
Nic Cage's best roles are when he's completely fucking balls out insane
I found Nic Cage through Homestuck :p
The only one I like is brony. Fillies would only work if it were colts. Pegasisters is not good. Bronettes and any similar terms don't sound good either.
lol
30 mins i think
my sound is off and my brother's is a split second behind mine
MrPoniator: 40 mins

Dat swagger
I know my friend, and none of them would go for Ponies on principle. They're mostly the types more concerned with seeming grown up than anything else.
Do you know when you'll do The Wicker Man showing?

0Gigora: Community
Couldn't you just google ponies?
Two words, Because Rainbows
Applejack: heterosexual Dash best Dash ; )

Viewer.
/me happily sings along
these buns
>implying he hasn't already
Ghosties gonna be giggled at
viewer video requests
Ghosties don't you mean Amareica
In the request channel.
4Yeah, it's a Bjornfot thing I suppose
#bronystaterequests
Ghosties or maybe even Amurrica
I gave that ghostie a hug. Ghosties love hugs
bjornfort * FTFY
I am far from fat Mr. Bjornfot
This is really well done..
07I normally allow some during the aftershow... last time 2hrs
So, given everything is pnified,
Port for what?
oh god that Applebloom voice
/me 11is fat.
Bjornfort is best fort
The ports it uses?
05yeah
/me is fat as well
Hmm
I demand australia to instead be Crocified
oh man, the problem I have with this song is how anachronistic that verse is
6667
Whats a good b movie?
6668
Bjornfot is a name who strikes fear into everyone who has ever watched a Brony Movie Night.
THAT is the only thing I have it
05my router is very restrictive
/me isn't fat
*have issue with
an entire Continent of Crocdiles
mysterious as the dark side of the moon!
And 8074 I think.
Let me check.
ALL STEREOTYPICALL ACCENTED TOO!
what?
Turtaguin: Spiderweb something something
Applebloom is here?
0whats Bjornfot?
Austrailia is a continent of death
trolo
4@Bjornfot: Not really, you're like the resident Nord. And nords rock in my book
Australia, the country where everything is trying to kill you
/me seraches for Applebloom
2,14 Turtaguin: usually a cult film or an incredibly bad (that it's funny) movie, but that isn't an all inclusive list
Frikken Caps
searches*
Incoming infinite birdnest. . .
now Applebloom, don't watch our movies today.
Australia needs moar ponies
k!
thanks!
11Turtaguin: Read the rules.
I'm pretty sure Tacowiz strikes fear into everyone
11It's at the bottom of the page.
Ponies?
4Tacowiz is the Public Enemy
Australia: Where nearly everything is trying to kill you.
Wait, Applebloom is in here?
TACOWIZ? No... not to be mentioned
Ayralynn, imo Bjornfot strikes more Fear D:
Ghosties: >implying Nords doesn't strike fear into the hearts of everyone in a 12km radius
TACOWIZ!
05(also TCP or UDP)
Oh
7029
I would like to clarify. I am a colt, not a filly. Cooked food is just better than frozen dinners.
Hey Ghosties! Tacowiz is my best friend! How dare you say that about him!
oh gosh I haven't laughed as hard as I did at the entire continent of crocodiles thing in a while
Serieously, Only Dash, AJ, Twiligh, Pinke and FLuttershy could Survive in Australia!
thanks for that
/sarcasm
I dunno, on my router I just put both I think.
4@Bjornfot: Maybe...but Nords kick ass regardless
/me is pleased
PUrpleDoom: i agree but frozen dinners are just SO convenient
05okie
I was just singing that entire song xD
OBEY
when does this start
05will probably DC real quick
the main thing
4@CAJ: And?
HEy Espylacopa, you added an extra "Nearly"
And Rarity,'cause she'd just get rich on Opals and Pink diamonds
0PurpleDoom coltiest colt of the cooking colt variety
Oh, 7029 and 8067
silverscreen: I've looked in the rules, i don't see where in the rules it says about a/b movies
anon: in 20 mins
:flutteryays:

05back in a sec

11Should be at the very bottom.
Yay this song!
whats the first show
silverscreen, what rule#?
Am I the only one who song the last song? x3
4Tacowiz picked worst movie, he's still in the doghouse
I should go remix this song
RIGHT NOW
Or just fly back home with the proceeds
So, 6667, 6668, 7029, 8067

I have a side by side, but if i use windows 7's half size feature its below the stream
/me hugs Dashite
I'm back on the 6th/7th or something.

Is it possible for a filly to be non-cute? I bet even Gilda was a cute...eh, whatever they call young griffons

So.
>mfw I also still use XP
An OST? I'm loving this stream more already
Hai
Lucid, you need to go find the picture that has filly dash and young gilda.
arcus is correct
XP was probably and still is best windows?
Are we gunna have any other servers.
It is a liquor made by freeze distilling hard cider
/me sits next to Applejack, preparing for the movie
Arcus: Drinking mahself? That ain't healthy...
in my opinion it is
Or should I just set up with mibbit now.
0I imagine gilda without any feathers and just bits of fur and Talons and only her lion features
/me hugs everypony
RainbowDashBrony, i actually prefer 7
I have to go talk to their opers.
>_>
11I would make a new page for the rules list, but Dinkypage has disabled that ability
?me uses Vista. *covers face in his hands*
nor right...
:P
/me enjoys the hug
7 is best windows
will it be a problem if we add more servers later?
4Val
Can't wait for Discord.
BAD bad exscalibrony
/me flinches at the sound of 'Vista'
12Vista sucks soooooooooooobbad
Well.
A bit.
4Did you have tonight's list?
This makes me want to read Past Sins again.
I agree with you all
agreed about vista
PrincessCelestia confirmed for troll. she can't wait for Hell.
11RDLover: No colors.
Indeed.
for the shows?
ME is best windows
Because it means I'll have to update the DNS round robin.
pokerface.jpg
Vista really isn't as bad as people say it is.
Woah, already that late? I need to get my snacks ready!
4Does anyone have tonight's schedule?
lol
Which takes up to 2 days to update.
Vista isn't that bad
11And yes, Vista freaking sucks.
07Ya all ready?
@applejack, applejack is a liquor made by freeze distilling hard cider
64bit vista is :(
Also, TheLobe wins
there's an auto warn we can't see, isn't there Silverscreen ?
nah man, Windows 3.1 is best Windows
DOS is were it's at
Show Stoppers, Dark Knight, Stare Master, Re Animator
4I need to update Steam
And it might kill the two DNSs that are currently linked.
Vists: the beta for Windows 7
i'll take Windows 3.1.1 over Vista any day, thank you
4Thanks
So our network would desync and die.
0Kindness
