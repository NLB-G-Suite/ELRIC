herospirit: his testicles?
I seem to remember an episode of House where someone's testicles explode spontaneously...
herospirit: yeah I think it was one of his testes
We don't., We're not even looking at you. It's merely knowing that you are restrained that comforts us.
:(
Denied_existence: I am not on the moon, that's why.

07nope
07it's vhs rip though quality is bad
me too, my family used to all gather around the TV once a week to watch this show
07:)
i watched it alot when i was younger too apparently
my mom's partner looks like MacGyver
except with less hair :P
those look like they're only clips
though maybe full episodes are blocked in my country
075 mins per ep?
though someone's uploaded them unofficially, I see
07cause it's a great show
yep, it is
/me suddenly noticed the deleay too
07nothing I can do about it
07:(
then macgyver turned into indiana jones
aw, consarn it :(
ohhh i remember this episode, I think
i think i might too
i haven't watched macgyver in... a long time
07neither did I
then suddenly.. 8-bit style music
but my family srsly watched it religiously
but seriously.. how did he get out there? was that his plane?
I still kinda remember my three favorite episodes
07which were?
one he had to break in to some maximum security facility
then there was an episode where he got knocked out and dreamed he was in the wild west, I think...
wh whuhwhat is this?
and third one he's back at his old school
this is MacGyver, Daz :P
also ohay
/me is hearing the 4-beat.
07he just wants his coke

Ok, I'll have to go, now. I might drop by at some point later on through my mobile phone
cya
just need a pic from behind where you can see her head and her arms raised... but that's proving tricky :P
arms raised above head you mean?
well, or to the sides of her head
well ok i'll just plug in my harddrive and search through pics :P
I haven't even found one where she's on her hind legs from that angle :P
Is Dari online, or atleast one of the mods?
Luna should be
best would be if she's reaching for something, but eh... i'm not picky
luna just streams normally, one stream, that's it
ok
silly Tab
Yep, we like ponies.

Huh, why Daz?
Do I need to DL something?
that's for downloading videos, not looping
My thoughts eactly
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-auto-replay-11636/ That's for looping
ITS LOOPING TIME

OMFG
Ping when you start streaming House again. I want to see "Part 2" of yesterday's episode. Wish you could do it after 5 PM.
07aww
07House s3 is planned on monday
Oh ok.
Labor day!
House s3 woot
nice!
I haven't been able to catch many episodes due to work.
patch by patch, patching it togetheeeeer~~
thats me!
Heh
oh wait, this isn't TNG
that was the one I was thinking of
Hai Dari
TNG best Star Trek.
VOYAGER, Y U END?
TNG, Y U END TOO?!
I did enjoy Enterprise much more than I thought I would, though
I didn't watch Enterprise through.
Yeah, which is too bad because it was getting really good :(
Pissed some fans off because they said it was not following the canon timeline as well.
not TNG good, but eh, beggars can't be choosers :P
06picard
I know... but I personally don't care about the canon timeline... they've changed the course of history more than once on Star Trek
Dunno.
true'
weird, stream's working well for me now
They had to travel to the '80s to bring back wales before a probe killed everything on Earth in their present.
*whales
it was shit for me at the start now its good
also they travelled back in time in the TNG movie "First Contact"
IT ALL MAKES SENSE!
Yes.
TNG did time travel in the series.
nait nait mib_aoelbl
TNG did it multiple times in fact.
Because I remember an episode of that, but not which series
Didn't know about that episode.
XD
lol okay, Pinkie_Pie
had a good scary time? :P
I guess
Goddamn I hated that puzzle
very cleverly designed
I refuse to play Amnesia
XD
Why Pinkie?
I would if there was some sort of weapon
But just having to run and close doors
I know >.<
You'll see that they can't hurt you just laugh and make them dissapear!
That's kind of the point Pinkie_Pie
disappear, even :P
But I gotta do SH first
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmaGcYf0IpI
Is that bad?
Not really bad, no.
BRB
Yeah, that's pretty much my stance on it :P
*with all the
I can watch later Saw movies and be fine (later ones are gory).
Quite gory, yeah.
Gore=/=horror
Yeah.
It does equal torture porn though
Exactly
In fact, 1 had very little gore.
Not really... Hostel 1&2 equal torture porn, pretty much :P
Worst. Aliens. Ever.
lol pretty much
"HEY! LETS INVADE THE PLANET WHERE THE DOMINANT SUBTANCE IS POSION TO US!"
Shyamalan hasn't made a good movie since Unbreakable, as far as I'm concerned
"Everyone have a bat?" "Mine has a nail in it, score!"
*poison
That's "War of the Worlds."
Are you talking Signs or War of the Worlds?
But I haven't seen that movie in ages.
War of the Worlds.
I'm talking Signs........
WRONG PAGE!
I did like Unbreakable.

Ponies: Making Katey Perry bearable
no. katy perry is never bearable
pinkie pie wrote this song
Mostly because they got rid of anything Perry did
^
/me wonders if the line is Furry Coats or Furry Colts...
Katy Perry isn't that bad.
That was pretty neat.
Even though I died inside.
Just a bit.
Because I know damn well she didn't do the production on that song
lol Silvermane
Alright~ :3
It was furry colts.
I'm sure you want it to be the latter :P
Colts was a typo.
It's meant to be coats.
Orly?
Coats would make more sense
O_o
Whoops.
It would.

POWAHHHH

@yoshyi it's actually a hilux
0they're losing everything out the back xD
....
They're in the tundra, aren't they?
Hiluxes are indestructable
Or is my geography that bad?
they're in the north pole
All they're doing is driving it.
Hammond didn't build the sled
I think they meant that they are driving on the tundra
Hammond has to go with 3 hours sleep.
And ski for 15 hours straight.
That I find to be much more impressive than anything that Clarkson and May did.
Bad luck, lol
XD
@yoshyi it's a Tacoma but they're called a Hilux everywhere other than North America
0Lol he's eating it xD
He can just eat around the buckshot

OHsnap
I just said what's been known through EqD posts, not through a certain picture that basically spoils the ENTIRE 2-parter
When was this? I've been away for about a month :'(
French, about a week or two ago
yeah
but don't try to look for it.
I'm feeling sad due to it being spoiled to me.
Sathi's up with the stream by the way.
Now I'm hooked

r u guys taking requests?
07nah it's 23:40 here and after the anthology it's showtime
Hey um, does the show ever explain why there are no adult ponies? (i.e. horses?)
Oh shit I remember Bonecrusher!!
11!
they DIED
!
07Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
Pony war
11!
!
!
Celestia is a horse......
Adult ponies are still ponies
Actually, isn't Celestia a horse?
Pinkie Pie
11TWIIIIIIIIIILIIIIIIIIIIGHT!
SNAAAAAKEEE
Pony is the Name of their species
I remember loving that show as a kid
Not at all doom
11Woody Woodpecker.
Not at all
Celestia is a goddes Incarnate
but celestia is not a horse she is an alicorn
07Silver modroom please
She could look like any damn thing she wanted
How do you know that there aren't any adults?
Pinkie. ,3
<3
How did each pony evolve?
Actually, I've found that suprisingly lacking in many fics
Hit level 30
That doesnt make sence
She could Literally Deconstruct the universe, and rebuild it without you In it
07*pokes the chat*
granny smith?
plus the oranges
Celestia and luna look like they age
11Alyure: The fanon is that her height is a direct result of the immense power she possesses.
Twilight Sparkle's parents are adults
Celestia and Luna are gods though
Dat Skype
Miracles
same with pinkies
There are Adults
They're just called Ponies
Adults are still ponies
I surmise that celestia and Luna are more of semi-gods.
MUTE
Pony is just a type of horse
07[23:41] <@Luna> Do we have any news for our viewers this week?
07[23:43] <@Luna> *pokes the chat*
Look at the Shetland pony'
I didn't get kick/banned now.
WHOO!
okay, to business.
They be teens, yo
14lol
I thought ponies were like baby horses?
4Hey
Nuup
11None that I can think of right now.
Foals are baby horses
Again, WTF is this? And they are probably somewhere between adults and children, i.e. teenagers
Or, in this case, a race of horses
I mean, Two of them have real jobs.
the mane cast are physically young adults, mentally tweens/young teens
I think their in the early 20's personally
dunno, he was just asking if you'd be here
11We should make a special announcement that the Lottery takes place tomorrow, to get more people to show up.
4@CAJ: Not much, motherfucker
so...they're our age?
06and fluttershy is 1 year older than pinkie
between 20-28 equivalents i reckon
impling the omnipotence or omniscience is a requirement for godhood
07sure
Well, that depends on how old you are
4When did we do the lottery last week?
gee, thanks for the cooking help guys :.

The only thing that pains me about this song is that you can tell she needs the auto-tune
/me starts watching pony episode on hub

14I think he might be mad he got turned down afterall. lol

I know my friend, and none of them would go for Ponies on principle. They're mostly the types more concerned with seeming grown up than anything else.
