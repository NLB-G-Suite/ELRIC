ADULT ENOUGH FOR YOU DMAN?
exactly
haha you posted that as i was typing that
Yeah, torchwood is a bit more adult.
weird
do you have teamviewer?
or VNC
this torchwood. this summer of nothing planned.
hmm
this magical power of finding vids online
: D
Reminds me of the Torchwood episode where the alien kills people by having sex with them.
Dman: they even got a cybermen in one of the episodes.
06nope. And I disconnect after ~2 minutes every time as well.
I remember that one dari.
succubus?
Good episode.
._.
ANyone watch fringe?
can you download teamviewer or something?
If it's male, it's an incubus.
i'm trying to remember i can't remember the 10 odd i've see nat all
06yeah I can
Dman: a woman that was part cybermen and that tried to make others into cybermen. We see the people mid-stuff.
thanks
yes
hmm
/me walks in
umm
Lol.
Hi.
humm
06okay installed and stuffs
alright
This episode is pretty quiet on my computer compared to normal.
: /
this episode is booming whenever I play it
they don't speak loud in the episode is all.
on volume i'm hearing livestream
But the buttons are pretty loud on my computer.
Why don't you use an amplifier program?
Yet quiet in stream.
06I tried the old one x.x
Just amplify all outgoing audio...
lmfao
It's the stream, yeah.
: / i cna't help at all then really
But meh.
Dman: I'm 100% volume though, on the physical sound control on my headset, on my sound controls, on my keyboard, on my screen, 4 layers of 100% sound.
I'll set it up some other time.
then stop being lazy dari
06and that worked ofc
I am going to try an experiment with aDosBox
lets see how good it really is
oh heck yeah, the pizza delivery scene. Good one.
03a few of the reviews say it's really sluggish
Pizza Time
I hear the stream, but I don't hear it loud.
needs to be about 20% louder
Look, I'll set up VAC or something for next week...
this scene is one of the awesomer in the pilot.
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-dk1axrNmqU/S1Zp-_jf0oI/AAAAAAAAKFU/uaGj2DPEzxk/s400/pizzatime.jpg
hah
06and somehow I accidentally whoised people okay
There's nothing to compare.
03oh
I've got the volume setting at 100% for everything.
03Ascendant
03question
06yay it's up
: /
03how do I see connects/disconnects without being oper?
welcome, to the HUB
Do you use the same streaming program?
Yes.
THE HAND!
The Torchwood hub.
NO
yes, the hand
uh...
is that genuinely the same hand?
No wai
I think it is.
technically you only need the cF snomasks
Jack kept it.
hmm I expected this room to be empty pretty much
03I know there's +E for the whois thing
but anyway
03but that seems to only work when someone's on the same server I am
wow i thought the master just took it
03if it's the other server, nothing happens :/
different target audience?
and yes, ocean needs it installed
i dunno
until Draelen installs it on ocean it won't work properly
03oh
03well
Dman: because torchwood is for older people?
03I couldn't have +W without being oper, could I?
03just because people \are bawwing over me being opered up right now
: (
(Though I did start watching torchwood at 4 years old)
03but I like having those alerts
03etc
: /
thta may be a reason why
06WALLOPS EVERYWHERE
06and how
06did you do that D:
Dman: it's got Jack Harkness.
pizza under the name of torchwood : D
Also, Martha Jones makes a few cameos
03LOL wallops?
yea i saw them ones or some of those
yeah
oh i thout it was about many people here
he's immortal.
oh ok
Dman: well about him and this specific girl here.
The only two main characters of the pilot to still be around after The children of earth
It's about the whol torchwood team. :P
whole*
sadface
07o.o
/me 7returns. o.O
hehehe
06mfw the lugia.us server is the one in my fav list with the best ping
ok
07lol
06I feel spoiled
yeah
lmao
/me pats Greg
This is the first episode in the torchwood series.
/me rolls
7Lol.
7Well, you're in Europe.
06yes and most people are
06not
06so xD
maybe
uh
TV seriously needs more lgbt
the server is in germany
06CURVE THE BULLET time
it's a pretty fast server
06Yes it is, but it does lead to some amusing headshot-around-corners moments.
In about two more decades this should have more diversity. At most in half a century.
In USA, maybe. We're far ahead in the rest of the world.
06And backstabbed-mid-rocketjump
History takes time to write itself.
06but it's the lesser of two evils for sure :p
7Ahem.
USA is ahead?
Wut.
USA is way too conservative and hurr durr.
UK forthewin
7Can I guess you have IRC invites off?
i guess
that and the canadian Prime Minister. He's also ultra-conservative.
06LOL
06I probably do if you're asking me LOL
06xD
This backdoor was my first awesome feeling for the series.
06oh nvm
06I just didn't see them
7Lol.
oh yeah we're conservative that's why we're trillions of dollars in the hole.
it's kinda hard to see
:p
no that's just because you suck
Sweden
i see
06it doesn't go 4red6 sooo
now i can understand that sentence
XD
it goes blue
or brown
06blue because blue = top tier
We're like, the LGBTQ-friendliest countries ever.
i'm tireeeeeed
Ok.
here in scandinavia
I don't mind homosexuals. I mind them showing off their homosexuality. I don't really care to hear about their sexual preference.
Oslo?
except finland, they've had too much russia influence
06and oi I should probably change my spray a bit...
/me hides
oh
06oh sh-
nittany_tiger/ My thoughts exactly
Speaking of which... there should really be some fillyfooling in FiM.
yes i heard about that
7?
and mentioned it here actualy
06"The server you're connecting to is running an older version of the game"
it makes incredibly much sense
o_O
well
the vphysics.so is from an old version
there's no real relationship muc hin FIM at all
06well, yes
we see pinkie's parents twi's parents um
06mmhmm
it shouldn't be an issue
aj's auntuncle
06update today
-___________-
06in fact physics involving FLOATING DISSOLVING PEOPLE
06xD
To see fillyfooling we'd need a scene on screen.
there's not exactly a million straight relationships as is
but yea fillyfooling in the show or coltcuddling for that matter would be fun to watch
:P
sort of
how's it going?
06what I don't get is
06we could connect earlier today
DUN
It's people highlighting me. :P
well the server crashed
^
His IRC client
Good thanks.
I thinm I'm going to continue watching all the episodes again tonight
How about you?
Ahh, nice. :D
it's been a while since I've watched them
I'm good too
thanks for asking
my computer doesn't DOM when people say Dman?
STOP HIGHLIGHTING ME
xP
hahah
lol
HAHA
xDDD

Most kids only know that boys and girls are supposed to be together.

Hmm.

TORCHWOOD THEME
06Yeah
,,,
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
...
Wut
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
is this the end of the peisode?
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFU
oh this has a limit too?
That's megavideo
No.
MFW it's not megavideo.
Pay for everything fail.
It's "videobb".
whaaa
did you watch anything on there?
hmmm... Lets stream some ponies!
http://www.novamov.com/video/k21fjalxlgouc
GOGOGOGOGO
hahah
HAVE NO FEAR DMAN IS HERE
and HAhahaha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw
lol
and yes, i found another link in 10 seconds flat. Jelly?
ok here we go
/me is helping mods. :3
MFW that's miracle day again?
I can understand why you don't want to focus on relationships in a kids cartoon... but if there's "normal" innocent crushes, why can't there be same-sex ones?
miracle day?
It's the BBC page.
With miracle day.
http://www.novamov.com/video/k21fjalxlgouc
:P
novanov
no it's novanov >_<
yes this one
Gonna go on drawball dont mind me
http://two.drawball.com/
:P
Homosexuality should not be considered or portrayed as odd or abnormal.
doo eet : )
SUDDENLY kissing
lol
'do you wanna do that really' 'you basterd'
but no luck
Especially when the conservatives of my religion get word of this.
putting homosexuality in a kids cartoon...
I need to change the mounting for the /sdcard/ directory
XD
O BOI HURR WE GO
Why should the parents have to explain something that's pretty usual?
sowwee. i found this vid in 10 secs flat. must become 20% faster thus find vids in 8 seconds flat
Capitalist greed sometimes makes me want to become socialist.
Capitalism<>Right-wing
not that I remember.
Of
Pony<>Pony
And then they fucked
I'm not saying we should force cartoons to incorporate homosexuality... I'm just saying that it would be good if they did.
As far as political parties go, I have none.
We shouldn't force anything on anyone.
Forcing things on people makes people angry.
I have my set of beliefs about anything and everything anyone would want to discuss, and I stick to them.
it was nice not having to click the next episode on the list
can't find it now
^that
LOL
wut
oh
spoke too soon
It would be creepy in the show.
straight too.
HARKNESS ON ROOF IS AWESOME
THAT I REMEMBER NOW
And I'm tolerant of all sexual preferences.
And religions.
And I don't see why there should be any kissing at all.
i'm tolerant ... and loving badumtiss
there shouldn't
The only thing I don't tolerate is hate against my religion.
i'm ok with season 2 not having kisses
Which is growing.
And upsetting.
guess why nittany, guess why
Conservative extremists.
I know why.
It's because many religious people are conservative idiots. homophobes and such
The "Hate everyone that's not Christian" people.
Wait, when does Rarity kiss Spike?
i'm saying it wud be cute in season 2
she doesn't
it would be cute in season 2 >_< just a peck on cheek for thanks. cuz we were talking about season 2 kissing
primary bl4d3
But anyway... Spike has an innocent crush on Rarity...
IT WORKS
yeah, Dman.
coool sweeet
The glove, for example, comes back later.
hi Quan
the first time I watched through the season I didn't watch the opening credits

hi
GOKAI WAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE
What's the best torrent program?
uTorrent
FMA's one?
duno
I can't say. I hate torrents for robbing my interweb.
I used to use BitTorrent.
arguable, but there are genuinely massive differences in speed that can be achieved
drf has a santrex FTP
i use bittorrent just because
03yeah, the one I'm letting you use
i used to use utorrent
03EW, no, Santrex is horrible, igniore them
03-i
wut
i don't have a prefference
O.o
03anyway deleted
you pay 300 a month?
I'm not a torrenter, but I used to be.
And, honestly, trying to be an honest consumer doesn't lead anywhere anymore.
Dman: 300$/month for going over the cap.
Except exploitation and accusation.
well its working
whewre do you live?
I just got a functional GUI
i have unlimited which is, you know, nice
DID I HEAR SHIT
wait that cant be right
I don't think WIFI tunneling works in this version
yes, Dman.
And with anime, I only torrented fansubs.
thats only for uploads right?
>resurrection for the whole world isn't taht good. that's the worst idea ever mate
for me just the fact that I have a working GUI is impressive
HAHAHA
YES!
rofl

Yeah, but I think he missed on early on to make up for it though.

Worst was when I was streaming Orbiter on Tinychat.
I hum and play pony tunes on the piano all the time
I was there XD
^
Yeah.
I did talk a bit. :P
I still haven't finished the run.
Yeah.
That'd be cool.
I would have to make one in the format that Orbiter accepts.
LOL and Livejournal is the ancient abandoned ruins!
Oooh! I know this vid!
*Derp*
And make sure it's a blue shirt
Too open.
really?
I'm quite a shy person.
awwwr *patpat*
How much more subtle do you think you could get?
then get something fluttershy related x3
You're probably a really cool person
I'd not really comfortable telling my friends.
Maybe.
other people are never nice
irl we are alone : P
Yeah.
I'm gunna get a pony shirt.
and rl is a scary place
I'd on wear it going out with family though.
And hope I don't run into any friends. XD

Maybe "Love and Tolerance" can fix this fucking country.
nah
Aww.

I'm only 18

I'm 10 years on you.
/me takes rhat out of context

/me returns from cubeworld

I can grow a decent goatee, but that's it.
and I usually shave it
MFW I'm always the youngest person.
but just not now cause it's summer brake
now with lower sodium
I have a full beard and mustache.
oh XD
I'm in the Navy...we can't have facial hair.
bbl
But I don't think I'd ever grow a real beard... it would decrease my chances of getting laid.
I just got back from a four-year stationing in Japan and Southeast Asia
That depends entirely on the beard.
Haters cast them as unemployed men in their 20s or 30s.
Well, that's Fox.
I PONYTIZED AT LEAST TWO JAPANESE WOMEN!
^_^
Actually, I haven't gotten laid since pony, but w/e
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwKclhWlo-0
I liked the Fox coverage.
I'm a virgin.
I managed to get two people online hooked on pony.
inb4 nittany waits until marriage
No-one likes Fox news except idiots.
12drf ;-;
I'm actually very interested in a girl I know online.
12eXAKR knows my voice
I'm just afraid to tell her I like her.
Especially since she's admitted that she's not into relationships.
But we are good friends.
i smell skyping
I didn't say I liked Fox news. :P
"Not into relationships?" lol
I was having a wonderful correspondence with a nice young woman on Flankbook via messages...but then the damn site went down!
12i smell....
12nothing, i want food ;-;
I wasn't into relationships until I was 25.
I was 100% school for a long, long time.
No. She's introverted like me.
Which I like introverts.
I do. I be myself.
:D
that's always the best
The only downside is that she can get confrontational.
ugh, women
always something.
And infuriating
Meh.
I have no desire to pursue any relationship with anyone.
They're not interesting, they're annoying. Most of the time.
actually, about 6.25% are pretty cool
I see myself as rare type of person who's more into having a relationship than sex, which I have zero interest in.
Relationships, I dunno, random fun at parties is a go though. :D
I don't do social meetings.
Oh hey! Non-shaky cam! http://media.nick.com/mgid:cms:video:nick.com:933818
Why not Nittany?
Being introverted makes it hard to make friends.
I'm just not a social person.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRCvzTubC8
I try to be a times.
I tend to be shy around people I don't know.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Kl0Gr1VYQ

Naw, Tiger, that just means you're mature
*cheerio
12gee how nice
Maturity can suck, but thanks.

I'm such a generous person
Nor possibly take 2-week trips to chase storms.
Unless I land a job in tornado alley.
The people I chased with did live streaming.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50-oWY1pFE&feature=related
I'm not very social irl
but I can find something to talk about with pretty much anybody.
I could never get anyone in the Penn State meteo dept to go on a plains chase with me.
Yeah.
I though of having a roommate, but it may not work out.
Because I like privacy as well.
That's why it's good to have an extraverted friend who'll help you fit in
I liked most of my roommates in college.
Sadly most of my friends are fairly introverted too...
lol I just realized the instructions that came with my hard drive are in engrish
03and, done with HP7.1
Well, I want to help the girl I like become less introverted.
03now I get to wait til tomorrow to see part 2 XD
FAQ3: "Drive does not be recognized in BIOS setup"
The thing is, some people like to push introverts into becoming extroverts. That's not how you do it.
"Confirm whether BIOS setup became correctly"
They have to do it on their own.

"Even though the HDD recognized in BIOS setup, it does not be seen in Windows"

Classy like Spike in a tux!
I was bullied throughout all of elementary school for having long hair. But I didn't give a single fuck.
We're real men. ;)
MFW most people in my school have long hair.
Myself included, though I really need to get it cut.
Ugh bullying.
Those years sucked.
I didn't have friends for most of my grade school years.
Mine's not REALLY long.
@classmeter Jaunty_Scribbles
Just hated everyone.
WHOOHOO!
But my fringe hair reaches my mouth.

Oddly enough, agreed with that. I've met a lot more people in college and can't think of any that I really didn't like.
12horrible
people used to cheat off me and I would let them...
Plenty of them in high school though. :/
03LOL
Clemson and Penn State have friendly professors.

Heh, I remember that happening in my programming classes.
03is it normal on a tooth with a filling in it, where if I touch that tooth it hurts a lot?
12maybe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D93SvHXLWCs

12usually fillings aren't supposed to hurt
03hm
I think that's normal for the first day or two.
03well
03I've had it for a few weeks
03but
else it might be a sign you need more than one lol
I ended up finished the 100+ little programs that we had to write about a month into the semester. I had people trying to steal my programs every time I got up from my computer.
03it's in the very very far back tooth that I can't really reach with a toothbrush
I'm just playing the links in order.
Oh wow
03and it seems to only start hurting in the presence of sugar
12any tooth is reachable
ok
12well drf
I played a lot of Liero that year...
12my teeth are sensitive to cold

@classmeter Jaunty_Scribbles

12you can imagine how irritating it is to be in a hot summer day

03I just dunno if I should go back to the dentist
I recall people asking for help in Math.
03and be like fix this filling plz
12well...
still got ya beat : P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMizcECkwXs
12what is the harm in going to the dentist and just asking them to look at it
Since coding is just logic.
12to get their opinion
03it costs money
03XD
I'm not logical at all
and time lol
12they can't really charge you if they didn't do anything
it bores me
12can they?
they might, it is america.

I'll slave through something computer related because I like computers though
If I could get myself to actually do my homework I'd be stronger in math than I am.

I aced everything up until high school when I goofed off.
12then watch it in mute
I aced everything in high school
I also like academia.
First year I ended up with high 50's to low 60's
Gives me a great sense of gratification.
I hate math
Yeah.
I'm just boring like that I guess
I remember figuring out things on my own just for fun.

both are pure logic
But unfortunately, I would find out that someone else did it before me.

Not really. I want to pioneer at least one idea.

It's because of EMOTION!
Because it inhibits individuality.
And it's totalitarian.
Because DAWWWWWWWWWWW we must take care of everyone!!!!11
It was the first time my brother had some.
unsuccessfully
everyone is equal hargblargl
He took maybe one bite and then went back to the kitchen to get milk.
Also implying logic isn't affected by emotion.
Communism is does NOT have to be totalitarian.
it is poor logic but I don't see emotion behind communism. Only bad judgement
it is dari
that's our weakness
now I gotta go guys quit bringing me back XD
to to break free form the bonds of emotion
bye everyone
see you tomorrow and monday
Meh.
to kick emotion in the face and embrace ture logic, when needed
like, in politics
Eeeeh.
cool
For politics.
12http://www.accuweather.com/us/radar/sir/wi_/radar.asp?play=true
if one used pure logic one would quickly realize that socialism is completely irrational
12drf, tell these blasted storms to go away
Hiya.
Constitutional Monarchy!
The ideal system WOULD be anarchy. It would never work, though.
How would that be ideal?
total freedom
no opression
Because anarchy doesn't work is the whole reason we have governments. :P
12Armads
habaneros
three of 'em.
12yeah
I'm not good with mslspeek, elaborate.
12you aren't playing around
12XD
i still believe that we should try to minimize those governments as much as possible, though
:3
and it was delicious~
commands other than the default
well to me.
lol
the less power for the gobernment, the more power for the people
12i honestly
12don't know where i can buy habaneros around here
Well you can do it the easy way, or the hard way

I'm glad my local grocery carries 'em.
/me has a shiver go down his spine
haha nice
granted though
they don't always look the best
but when they look decent that's when I buy them lol
Which would be somewhere in preferences I guess...
...why am i ranting about politics, now again?
Dunno. XD
Something about emotions?
well
well, how do you make them? :P
o rite, polarfire
I totally wasn't
12It probably was :<
:D
Well you open up the User commands window, which is SOMEWHERE!
Right now, we need to get our crappy economy under control and stop greedy corporations from ruining the US.
12i wasn't
12Glad you had a fun time though :3
12i'm too busy downloading tf2 on another computer to play tf2
WUT

12lol

IT'S REAL, YOU CAN BUY IT
WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
And stop corporate-backed bills like S.978 from even being conceived.
And then like, you click add, or whatever "+" button you see, and you type in the name, lets say "ram"
wait
me rams the fuck out of &2.
me prances off.
And then you can...
/me prances off.
12My computer was borking to badly to play tonigh
:P
12tonight*
Settings -> Advanced -> User Commands
MFW we stream longer than BMN.
I couldn't play because I was too busy not playing
thanks
f yeah¨
The hard way would be to take up perl, tcl, python... and Csomething
like, ducktales?
Then you're a million steps ahead cause if you know them it's awesome
heh
then I need to figure how to incorporate it into x-chat
http://xchat.org/docs/xchatpython.html
Myster solved.
03ew. x-chat.
/me runs
/me nini
That's like, languagist.
12lol
:D
/me happily doesn't eat them
even I'm not that crazy XD;
12XD
12what are they?
12supposed to be like 100 times hotter than a habanero?
But once you figure out the whole Language -> XChat shit it's pretty cool.
the hottest naturally-occurring peppers on the planet.

MFW I'm going to get those and put them into food.
...
Then give it to my friends.
:D
but it's higher than I really want to bother with lol
That doesn't look like a thumbs up at all
That looks way worse.
Although outside.
WHICH I ASSURE YOU IS A THUMBS UP.
Yeah.
rofl
12yeah and you can hide the body easier
12lol
and just dowsing oneself in pure capsaicin
12i....
MFW this show.
one of those is nice.
I have never seen this show before.
The fuck?
that prety much sums it up, yeah
I just feel intense pain
:(
12do you know capsaicin is used for pain relief?
12XD
XD
heya PTS
YOU DING-DONG
12XD
and xchat actually is pretty good
12it's supposed to numb the receptors
12i guess after you died from the pain of ingesting it
and python is easier than perl imo
rofl
you'd be numb to a lot of things.
isn't ice less you know
:(
'
episode 5 is best. it has vikings
I've never done perl :p
His arms! They're all noodly!
python is awesome
...
O_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________o
Adventure time?
dat face
I don't remember noodly-armed people in it.
12o-o
um. . . that
12maybe
my experience with capsaicin on the skin definitely wasn't numbing lol

12!espeon
I dunno about warm lol
I'd describe it more as
intense pain
12i never thought it'd hurt to have it on the skin
no, thankfully XD
12XD
...
that woulda been even uglier.
This show...Is just...Strange...
12much much uglier
it just doesn't happen right away
I don't remember any of that crap in Adventure Time.
I think it took sixty to ninety minutes for me to feel it.
maybe two hours.
And then I wouldn't stop feeling it.
Strange?
Unless you're referring to rainicorns.
You haven't seen strange until you see the boom boom mountain episode
I've seen it.
I consider The Regular Show strange, not Adventure Time.
This is seriously frightening me.
12oww
...
12you know some people actually get injeceted with capsaicin
It's just strange.
12by needle for pain research
XD
I'd only do that if given ridiculous compensation.
12yeah XD
12same
12then i'd ask if i can have some in a glass
oh my.

Or you could just use pepper spray, that's pretty close.
dem adult jokes
12beckoning people over
12"hey, you want the hot stuff?"
selling capsaicin to unwitting customers and watching the ensuing pain
I should try it.

04I prefer it
04More victims for my sniper XD
04haha
04Don't arrows kill in one hit?
No, but they deal a good amount of damage. Around 120, I think.
04Well
04Fully-charged sniper bullets deal about 3/4 of their health
04Get a headshot and they're doomed.
Yeah, but that requires precision. I don't have that without a mouse, lol.
Lol Norway
Aiming with analog sticks is hard.
It's also just fun to shoot random arrows and get kills. XD
good thing its over
04XD
04Well
04I've gotten a few headshots
04They really aren't worth the hassle because enemies move around too much.
04Just hit them twice in the body - Heavies are prime targets if you catch them unaware
They're only meant to be pulled on other snipers or people standing still.
06heavies I find easier to shoot twice in the face but that's just me :P
Give my my insta-kill headshots. xD
06sounds like a plan :P
04XD
04I was playing CoD the other day with a friend.
I'm guilty of doing that when I first tried TF2. XD

06The sniping is fine if you play as a sniper "should", but the hit detection IS pretty terribad :P
04Exactly
04I also hate ACOG scopes. They don't even ZOOM

heh, Armads
Read Reminiscence and lol at how long it is
/me hides
rofl
it's my fanfiction :p
oh lol
well, story
not really "fan"fiction
it's 23 chapters, but some chapters are 15000+ words
rofl damn XD
This chapter's only some 2300 words and that alone took me like a week to do lol
or Xeli
lol
my story kinda isn't a fanfic either
042300
04lol
lol
04I remember when I was proud for writing 2300 words in a chapter
^
WELL SORRY I'M NOT A PRO NOVELIST :( :(
04Now I write at least 4000 words.
04LOL
04Pro novellist? In my dreams.
lmfao
I write at least 5000
maybe I should make that my goal for chapter 1 then.
lol
04Nah
04Unless it's an extremely long prologue keep it brief.
06and I really have to just try to get some sleep even though I won't be able to x.x
mostly this chapter introduces the setting.
even the main character doesn't show up until the last couple of paragraphs rofl
04Xeli
04Usually you're waking up at this time
04Heh
rofl
04My first chapters mainly include HUGR background and plot information.
sleep schedules are for wimps

04Ascendant, you're best with reviewing
04You do it
lol
it's probably only going to be about 10MB though
and lol I'm already seeing problems with my writing
the first paragraph
sentances are a bit long
fixing that too.
I could probably arrange the whole chapter into one sentence.
o_O?
"It could easily have been starvation or thirst, but the arcanists of Skadi had suspicions of far more sinister forces at work in the desert."
switch easily and have
k
last bit there is dodgy
just doesn't make any sense
as in the "void" bit
hm
I'm figuring that you mean something like it's disappearing and such
fair enough lol
it's a phrase thingy or whatever those were called, sayings, whatever, but yeah
I think I'll just put "no sane man would have"
"At least, it was sure to not be the [i]only[/i] force."
reword that
and I also swear you switch from past tense to present tense
which is just about one of the worst things that can be done in a story
lol :(
04I prefer to keep in present tense
04And don't worry Armads
I prefer to stay in past
lol
04wait
04yeah
04past

04I'M NOT USED TO WRITING TERMINOLOGY OK?

travellers
oh lol

04Yeah
04I mean
oh lol
I use 'guardsmen' all over the place :(
I kind of have a cheat sheet for naming places lol
04I mean
04'Sacer'
infinitive
or 'races' backwards
/me shot

04It's Latin for 'doomed' actually
04As you could tell, the town is 'doomed' XD
04http://pastebin.com/7EZPSUKv
does that one make more sense?
maybe, I guess it does make more grammatical sense lol
04I don't think anyone visited that link LOL

only problem I have with it is mentioning all those nations' names at once like that lol
04XD
04But I might trim it down.
yeah :(
hearing all those names and not knowing their relationships with each other is kinda confusing
■ ■

04It's just nations that border the other two
04some guys got pissed and are now stabbing each other

04lol
04late much?

and Armads
yeh?
you should read TCTL or Reminiscence :p

10It's been down for about a week
It really surprised me
12She’s been upgrading the site to SMF 2.0
12Not that I heard of
hmm i see then 3.0 right away wouldn't make sense
12True
Fail :P
12But yeah, it's going to be down for a long time I think before Arti can open the site again.
122.0 is a bit complicated :/
I bet
Yeah :P
And GUI/Release cycles
12Anyways, bbl
alright later night
Seeyas
these builds aren't anything too special either
kinda lackluster if you ask me
:P
i was actually impressed by IE9
key word being was

Should check out IE10
Lol
that's only a platform preview
No idea
i'm sorry i won't bore you with tech talk
And then, suddenly

And in a year
3 years
i would rather them take longer between releases
At least the stable versions of IE/Chrome are improvements from the previous versions xD
i just want a kinect enabled IE 10
XD
yea i know
WHich...is kinda bad
Well, GUI based
Apparently some Kinect hackers actually made it real
Yeah, Kinect is a touch screen in the air
Which was awesome
did you not like the start screen ?
Or the Metro interface
Metro is visually pleasing
The world should be moving to flat squares and icons now
:P
Ew

Visually
it's 8 but not quite
I have 7989

Oh nice
Where did you get that from?

Satotaku: I'll be looking forward to see that happen.

:o
If they are gunning for three-year cycles this should be it
I honestly don't care until Win8 is -out-.
then I won't care until win9 is.
Satotaku: I was more meaning.. 'Microsoft OSes in general'
though worth noting
it's all tile based now
tiles?
oo
http://news.softpedia.com/newsImage/Windows-Start-Screen-in-Widows-8-2.png/
I mean the tech behind "Windows 8"
in name alone
it's something different
oh, those tiles.
that's the whole OS Staeld
i think the "Windows 8" i'm running is the compatibilty desktop that was shown
when you said tiles, you got me thinking about tiling window managers.
10o.o
Yes
bootcamp just allows it to be installed ?
Media based I think
o.o
yup.
I hope there isn't a bootcamp for "Windows 8"

In other words, it just partitions the drive ;p

nah
Nah
Not worth it
:P
my bad iPad 4*
bootmanagers are essential to boot anything.
3 is supposed to be revealed in the fall
even powered by "8" ?
Actually i'm hoping for cheap "8" tablets
Or no tablets at all
;P
Isn't apple screwed already?
i meant as an example
Well, eventually they well
Nah
iPad idiots are everywhere
:)
That'll be a great idea
"8" is a unified OS
Phone, I doubt it
But maybe
If 8 phones ever come out
:P
one os at last this is very good
Compatibility desktop
Yeah, but drivers
Some drivers didn't work on 7, or software

as if each side of the keyboard were really there ?
Yeah
Poke the air and that'll type
could work
welcome back Darky
/me awakens
WB
what's really exciting is you only pay for the parts of "8" you'll actually use
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkKcFKzorQ
you can buy "8" in pieces in theory
it could be as cheap as $20 or the full $200-400 for all the features
you probably just buy features as you go
with all the features already
it's a great idea in theory
if you don't need fax and printer support why should you have to pay for it
and you can always just add it later
or networking if you only need wireless that's all you should pay for
am i right ?
Yeah :P
we can forgo the need for a password and instead be scanned and logged in
now that's very cool
very hard to hack a computer with that kind of system in place
You have to use a password then

Dunno. I'd have to know the formulas for heat index and humidex.
The formulas are on wiki.

@Maxaminus It's a comic review show,in which a Minnesotan called Lewis Lovhaug,a.k.a Linkara,reviews bad comics.
Woop
I'm down for that.
I got some cool pix though
There's also a MLP:FiM reference in one of the episodes.
http://i.imgur.com/WO2Ye.jpg
Also,there's a "Zombie goasts" joke in another episode.

/me tried putting his through the washing machine after conventional means of cleaning wouldn't work
12not letting any detail go amiss
ahh
12however i did recently track mud onto one of the mats
12They won't dry? lol
mud is next to coffee
12yeah
as to the list of things that are impossible to get off of mats
12D:
microwave them :>
/me shot

12it probably isn't helping i have them all laid on top of eachother
12but you'd think the very top one should be drying
..yeah..
WTF?
fricking wi-fi.
Laser sharks ate it
lol
12i've thought about using a hair dryer
Well,i never did watch Salad Fingers.
12but i'd probably need 1.21 JIGAWATTS to power it for that long
Lolwut
Back to the hairdresser?
12o-o
