He's back from the beach.

Badmouthing Trixie when she's standing right there.
06for 15,-
No wonder she runs off.

Wait, did nobody notice that Colgate is BLUE and has the timelord's HOURGLASS?
Angry Ditzy.
Hah, Hipster, this is neat. When I opened up the page, I got hipster Fluttershy for my icon
6>it says Easter instead of Eastern
OH GOD
Handsome
cloudkicker: Seriously guis?
Kaiju Bear.
Colgate was ALWAYS blue, and ALWAYS had the hourglass
But Twilight can teleport for real...

Showstopping ability.
Big ass.

SilverMane: think deeper. What is BLUE and is related to the timelords?
>Please spank us, Twilight! Spank us really long and hard!
As the icon for the tab, yes
Why's everyone looking at the sky?
Celestia vs. Ursa Major = ?

GastonXBloomberg fic
6EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEnope.
Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, the manliest pile manliness ever to grace a single human body.
Oh, stream is all over for today?
mine has been stuck on this rarity one all day
Nope.
He's a funny felly
fellow
Jesus
6We've still got Black Dynamite.
We still have BLACK DY NO MITE to go.
8sorry guys, technical difficulties
DY NO MITE
No one is a brony like Gaston!
*facepalm*
@dragonrage are you italian?
GastonXGummy
Gaston's even got manly neck muscles.
10DY NO MITE

10DY NO MITE
Black Dynamite x Rarity
Me? No.
Wut.

I just like the word ciao.
that mean i can't read!
LOL
What's going on?
SilverMane: I dunno, but I want pizza.
Black Dynamite x Mane 6
/me goes to find Gaston song
6Different error than before.
Gummy is hosting a upscale party in an upscale club in upscale Manehatten.
haven't watched Black Dynamite, and cna't watch. more ideas!
So random 57 people what should I eat?
6This one plays, but it just says it's 0:00:00 long and instantly stops.
8Black Dynamite x The Man
Human flesh.
not bad sotha, any other ideas?
wtf?
Imagine what Gaston would be like if he was as intelligent as Beauty.
6Sorry guys, have to drop stream for a sec to fix the technical problems.
Wait, her name is Belle.
How about non-shipping.
you should eat a turd sandwich *trollface*
6I DON'T KNOW.
7are you running the latest vlc version?
Dee_Twenty no in the mood for hunting tonight
Eat some cupcakes.
Combustiblelemons Voided by the troll face
Rainbow cupcakes. :p
Sounds spicy.
I think next week for the movie night I could be watching from a hotel room in Windsor.
Hmm SilverMane. . . I think we need other people to contribute, but I will continue thinking.
Just remembered that you can't go on sites that aren't registered as 'safe'.
/me so far we have Gummy hosting a party in a club in Manehatten. Currently best suggestion, any other ideas before i get writing in my head?
oh I know!
I have pretty pink cupcakes.
eat baked bads.
No hot sauce, unfortunately.
Damn.
Is this shipping fic?
Baked bads FTW.
doesn't have to be, Nittany_Tiger_
Power Ranger Ponies
Good.
Did you try it earlier?
depends on how people push it
SilverMane just a quick question who do you want me to record?
just you?
how will others join in?
....Good lord, Gaston eats five dozen eggs a day?
yes Dman, but not yet. others will suggest, and I wite
03o.o
; ) sure thing bro
SilverMane, I mean, what kind of fic do you want to write?
Or is it just wherever our suggestions lead?
What filte type is the film?
that protein's good for him espylacopa
file*
How big is the file?
Think of that cholesterol though.
honestly Sotha, whatever they suggest works, although i will control it slightly
grimdark, sad, comedy, shipping, random, w/e is fine
He's roughly the size of a baaaaaaaaaaaaarge
Black DynamiteXZecora
!sneas
/me now belongs to Link for 25 minutes
:3
his cholestoral level is over 9000 I guess.
brb
Ponies in Halo.
Ponies in metro 2033?
Stalker Ponies?
6The file is the right size.
/me is going to get the story going in his head, and will be back soon. See you then guys!

Ponies in Amnesia: Dark Descent?
RarityXCyclops Pony
ciao, SilverMane
inb4 soon images
Have you tried it in a player other than VLC?
We need astronaut ponies.
man that would be scary
:3 nice one Silvermane.
Power Ranger Ponies: Has it been done yet?
we need more 2033 ponies D:
Just in case her sister gets mad again.
I'm not exactly fit with coming up with good story material. We could have the Party of One guests (Gummy's favourite partiers) attending, and the mane six have to learn to try to cope with them.
wow, totally just refreshed the page and messed my name up like a dumbass
Pony Hill?
We could have Pinkie upstaged by Gummy as a better party host.
Resident Pony?
In my dreams, I see that town...
:|
2012: Ponies.
RobotPinkie: that already exists
6Yeah, I have.
Lemme fetch a link
Twister: Ponies.
We could have the Oranges attending, and Applejack feeling as if she has to try to live up to some standard for them or something
So, what do?
Ponies trying to understand the weather that they control. :p
/me comforts HML.
What file type is it?
Wow, I might have to read that, sounds... Horrifying
Deatstalker: Ponies?
:o
Grand theft pony?
RobotPinkie: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/story-silent-ponyville.html Quite a good read
alone in the ponies?
Battlestar Celestia
Thanks, Munith
Of course SilverMane doesn't get any of my ideas. :P
My internet's continually derping right now
Still hoping for an Amnesia crossover sometime soon. You're welcome!
MLP crossed with the Diablo franchise.
Oh well.
6I've got another file downloading.
6It's .avi
Have some grimdark as the three Prime Evils invade Equestria.
I'm sure SilverMane will come up with something good.
still searching for pony 2033 images :(
Silvermane I don't know if i'll be able to record, my internet's really derpy right now, and this rarely happens but when it does it goes on and on for hours
snap, Dman.
inb4 SCREAMERS
6Sorry about the technical problems everypony, stream's back up with a short vid while it gets fixed.
yea dermathil please tell him i'm gonna go offline for a while.

i actually think i have seen it Combustiblelemons :P
03nah
6not planning on buying them at the place
03well
12How do you get on IRC via wii?
Pony Polka is awesome.
03it costs extra to buy them online
Weird Al is awesome.
03and my friend is cheap
i say we watch friendship is gic after this
agreed
03so hew as like, don't bother
03>_>
Weird Al + Ponies = ???
6Hmm... looks like everything that was in that folder doesn't work... text documents, images... everything... Oo
Even Wierd Al has responded to the pony polka.
I think he's a brony too?
the only Weird Al album i ever owned was Bad Hair Day
Weird Al + Ponies = Awesome.
with capital A
Has anyone done a Weird Al pony yet?
Needs more harmonies
7you might want to scan your pc for parasprites
7and such
but it was awesome
yes sotha, at the end of this vid
6I'm going to.
7doesn't sound normal to me
he makes a cameo
perfect
Season 2 maybe for a singing Wierd Al pony?
The older I get, the more I love Weird Al. It feels weird.
06just on mibbit GL
Feel Good!
I heard that they had tried to contact weird Al so he could cameo in an episode.
Lol.
06i tried it, but you might want to use a USB keyvboard
12But how do you push enter D:
03send button
06erm...
06yes, send
I am not joking.
lies
seems like something he would do, imo
lol.
/me 12nods
I think it was on EqD.
Oh dear god yes
I'm pretty sure there's at least 1 IRC client for wii homebrew.
I doubt it
03is there?
I remember there being 1 when I checked AGES ago.
03I haven't seen one actually
MLP must get awesomer!
03then again I haven't even touched my Wii in like a year
03so yeah
03somehow playing games on Xbox seems more satisfying
It isn't already
?
03you get achievements to show off
My favorite Wierd Al cameo I've seen so far was his cameo in Transformers Animated, as Wreck-gar. "I DARE to be stupid!"
03you beat a game on Wii and you're all like "...I just wasted my life"
03and have nothing to show for it
03XD
:D
FOUND IT!!!
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/fim-director-asks-weird-al-for-guest.html
there we go
awesomely made pmv.
sotha still doesn't mean it can get MORE awesome
not much of a cameo, but i loved his Weasel Stomping Day song on Robot Chicken
true
12lol. Too bad wii don't have achievements
And I can say that you've wasted your life with achivements :D
03I know
03but at least you can show others
03etc
Double take.
Wait a minute
And that's an APRIL news article.
...and everyone has the same achivements
And nobody will care
:)
A mere technicality.
SEE?
03LOL
do you scan these files after you download them?
friendship is gic?
one of them may have had a virus
6Sorry about the technical problems guys, I got hit by a virus and it killed my whole folder, apparently. Should be fixed in a few more minutes.
Dastardly lyrical shenannigans!
Toot?
Seriously, that is going to be true
6I do scan them.
nah
darnit, that's bad SirSprinkles
cut my steak into pieces! this is my plastic fork!
everyone is different ;p
SirSprinkles YAY!
6Something else hit me. Dunno what.
oh viruses, you so silly
strange
7maybe malware
Back to OoT3D then :P
damn virusus
my friend honestly thought what this song said when he first hears it
6Probably.
YOU WANTED TO
7get malwarebytes
Fire temple 8D
I love this song
6I got it out already though.
SirSprinkles you really haven't had a good week have you?
I think the IRC client was part of one of the homebrew OSs.
SirSprinkles' computer ate a baked bad.
/me hugs SirSprinkles
And strangely, I'm not stuck yet... 3 keys in
03oh, could be
6Didn't take long to fix.
I feel for ya, Sprinkles.
12Lol SMF 2.0 must be giving Art the time of her life xD /random
6Hooray for Norton?
7eww norton :D
12Arti*
viruses are teh suck =/
where i am the clock sign: 0.00
7what did it find?
6 PM EDT here.

12Because TST is still down
6Dunno.
11:00 PM here.
11pm
11 o'clock GMT
3pm here
as in it's midnight
High five
4 hours and we still have 1 movie left.
good thing it didnt hit your ponyfolder
I would make a off colour joke about Arti's free time
But nah
pony folder*
U.K bronies unite!
I'm still standing we gotta watch Ponyscope for today after.
So, 22:00 GMT
Busy her :x
OH GOD
noooooo
OH GOD G£
argh g1 pobnys
my eyes
6Eyup.
Ponyscope?
G1?
G1 guitar players out of nowhere
:o
MFW my pony folder is gone.
sotha: PMV of horoscope for today.
03LL
...
oh okay
03I need to do my laundry
wat
hey, g1 is okay
03and then I can talk on XBL
derp
It was on my hard drive which went boom.
7:(
>5000 pony images T_T
oh shit, that sux
hate on g3 all you want
It might be able to recover it though.
gah, I'm so exhausted, I woke up at 5am and ran 4 miles
7ah
hopefully
gentlemen.
ReticentSmolder why?
G2 was ok.
oh Al
because I'm training for a half-marathon
12I wonder if she’s going to be changing the navigation tabs or anything
What's more annoying is the I had loads of irreplaceable stuff on there, unlike pony episodes/images.
Ah fun fun fun
I haven't really watched any g2 stuff
Dayum, Fluttershy.
Insanity would be: Episode wherein Pinkie Pie's uncle visits the town for a day. . .and it's the Wierd Al cameo.
i remember when !!Derpy got locked out of his mod account on ponychan because he spilled tea on his laptop
oh, and 5am because it hits 100 degrees by 8am here
damn, that really sucks man
*obeys fluttershy*
Yes. Weird Al should be Pinkie's uncle.
EspyLacopa: that has potential to be the best episode ever
Not surprising
pinkie's uncle = mr cake.
No wonder pinkie's so good at playing musical instruments
You say that as though she is only allowed a single uncle.
12No, she said she would be working on the site with Lugia this week
so many people say that Weird al would become Pinkie's ungle
I thought they weren't related Combustiblelemons
12kay
she has been. At her home.
then why does she live there?
dat dash banana
The cakes and pinie are just close
they left yesterday though.
apprenticeship
12Also, who are you? XD
Weird Al is actually *Pinkie's father* you know the one with the "problems"... she had to go to a foster home
The cake family and the Pie family
not sure if she's still working on them while they're gone.
Hm, makes sense

HAHA
ow wow
MFW this
"So over on Twitter, Goldenrusset (The Director for MLP FiM) has sent a tweet off to Weird Al asking him for a guest appearance! So far he hasn't responded yet, but it's still neat to see people from the FiM team actively posting around on the internet. I can only imagine how crazy a Weird Al Pinkie Pie episode would be! "
<3
amazing
love that pic
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this totally needs to happen
eeyup, that'S Weird Pony alright
They even got the floral shirt right
12o-o
His cutey mark: He's a large ham?
12XD
Weid Al is hammy
seems like it, could be also a reference to the food album he released (FAT and Eat it being on it)
that's supposed to be ham?
huh
Hammond Organ?
03let's hope Weird Al has some sanity and turns the offer down
That or Bologna.
:P
ham with a pineapple slice
Weird Al has posted pony videos on his Twitter before.
lol troll pinkie face
So I'm not so sure.
">	let's hope Weird Al has some sanity"
lolol
It looks like bologna
yeah, i think that looks like bologna
12Weird Al? sane?
12It would help promote him, so he probably will do it
he's also holding Pinkie's Accordion (color)
Nah
flutterplot
12the world will stop
I agree
Dermathil: Where do you think Pinkie got /her/ accordian?
hehe, gift from her awesome uncle?
Her Wierd uncle.
more like it EspyLacopa
>mfw bestiality wordfilter on ponychan keeps ruining everything
friendship is gic
Weird Uncle Flank.
06Would be rather silly though
NOW! :D
Is everything fixed?
Hopefully pinkie pie will have a dialogue where she says she's got a "Weird" uncle.
that'd be so awesome without even him being on the show
12That it would be XD

Dirty Harry vs. Black dynamite
SPINNING NEWSPAPER DECLARED LAMEST CLICHÉ BY POPULATION.
so, who would win?
12you google that then your computer looks brand new
8probably, im getting a shitload of lag
But nothing can stand against B.D.
/me hides
No one elky
The world would turn into a holocaust
Clint Eastwood would win
DAMN IT LAG D:
that's what I figured
Same here, Hipster. I just keep refreshing every 15 seconds or when I get heavy lag
where the only survivors
My version doesn't have the evil laugh
but eastwood has a gun
would be clint and black dynamite
THEY GOT EVERYTHING!
inb4 next Hipster movie ref
if B.D. met Clint Eastwood. . .BD would learn how to be an awesome cowboy, and Clint would learn how to wear an afro like a pro.
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/epic-fail-photos-sticker-placement-fail.jpg
torrent dled watching off stream now
What would be child of Clint and Black Dynamite be like?
the answer to Clint vs. Black Dynomite is Chuck Norris
the end
You guys need to see Dirty Harry
Actually I think Clint vs. B.D. = Clint X B.D.
Whoops
>Clint Eastwood with an afro
>mind blown
How did that happen? :P
if you all think of clint eastwood exclusively as a cowboy

kung fu treachery vs. leverage--which is better?
PANTHER FIST
how appropiate
leverage
Yeah, that's probably my least favourite of that collection
leverage
Kung Fu Leverage
leverage is a boring meme
shoot him
that dynamite would use panther fist
Wu sounded exasperated when he said "Get him!", like he's wanting to know why his men didn't attack while Dynamite was making his little speach.
6-_-;
I wonder if there's any more
inb4 elky gets kicked
so I'll go with whatever BD has to offer
6Im sure
MFW leverage is probably the most popular meme in terms of number of mentions.
@Elky So......What WILL be the next week line-up?
12well on the bright side
because it's just a teerm
12the mud i tracked into the car is no longer there
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7LKm5Vdius
Wu needs a sword for this fight.
12XD
12all the mud i tracked in ended up on the floor mat and i just washed those XD
10so much leverage
let me see into the future destructor...
D: Internet Why do you cause problems for Dman?

ugh, der untergang...
dat apology
Black Dynamite: First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped you into that china cabinet. I used excessive force. Oftentimes, I cross the line, but I try to do so in the name of what's right. Most of the time, the ends justifies the means. But in this case, I feel like I betrayed my own code of ethics. And for that, sugar, I apologize.
Patricia Nixon: But I shot at you. I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite. Black Dynamite: This is true, but you did not connect. You shot a plate. Had you connected, pimp-slapping you into that china cabinet might have been justified. But I feel I crossed the line. And for that, please accept my apology. Patricia Nixon: I do. I do, it's just... oh, Black Dyna
nixon vs hitler would be an interesting kung fu match
I didn't really lika it

The Black Dynamite show.
Animated series According to the website Latino Review, White says a cartoon spin-off of the film will be produced for Cartoon Network (presumably for their Adult Swim block), with animation production by the same team behind The Boondocks.[21] The 11-minute series pilot, written by Carl Jones & Brian Ash, was produced at Titmouse, Inc. It features the voices
of the film's original cast members including Michael Jai White, Byron Minns, Kym Whitley and Tommy Davidson. The animated series was picked up on April 6, 2011, with an anticipated debut of spring 2012.[22

-gasp-
HE .... HATES .... FLUTTERSHY?!!!!
KILL HIM WITH FIRE
ELKY
inb4 elky gets violently kicked again
YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY YAY~~~~~~
So... playing more Amnesia, or listening to Fluttershy singing "yay" repeatedly....
fluttershy just seems like a boring character
suddenly elky was hated.
Hey, love and tolerate guys
ya
according to fraps, this livestream is going at 11FPS :P
/me has a rocket-powered military-grade lawnchair with civilian-grade comfort that can take trolls to the moon in a single shot.
I just can't resist Fluttershy. :(
Report to Sugarcube Corner, Pinkie Pie said your number is up.
funfact right there
well, 15 - 20 odd now
Yeah! Pinkie Pie is the best pony anyway...
Fluttershy is boring, but essential.
8LOUDER!
I'mma love and tolerate da SHIT otta ya brotha!Ya dig it?
LOOOOUDDEEEEEER!
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
Loudeer
her 'character developement' just seems like 'let's make her the complete oppostie of wht she normally is'
yay~
*me also has a wind-powered netgun.
They need to develop her more I think
what now?
GIC
YAY
/me also has a wind-powered netgun.
MOAR FLUTTERSHY
I mean there must be more to her than bunnies and flowes.
8fuck owl city
<3
YES!
not very three-dimensioanal to me
I see your point, Elky. I hate when shows do that.
/me doth quite believe that SirSprinkles has exquisite taste
UMAD hipster?
<3
06i'm testing some stuff now, going to tdo a live stream again
*trollface*
Suddenly,Fluttershy!Millions of her!
7such a cute picture <3
06but this time without music
Okay :)
Dermathil i live on moon base alpha yuour agurment is invalids
06but with live commentary
TEN MILLION FLUTTERSHIES
: D
Needs Billy Hays
Hopefully the gala was just a one-off. Let's face it, the show is too popular to get canceled before season 4 or so
+ what Sathi said, that picture
but I'm sure Fluttershy will have awesome episodes in S2
Enough fluttershy for everyone!
So plenty of time to become 3D
so it's okay
The gala was almost certainly a one-off.
Sklar: I can get myself over to oyur base and banish you on Mars with it.
Too much cuteness!
Wow, this is incredibly well done.
06anyone who want to watch: http://www.livestream.com/lusgamehouse
So it is still pretty much valid. YOurs aint tho
pegasi : D
Sounds just as legitimate as the official song
[1,0You0,4Tube]: MLP - Fluttershys 20% cooler version - Fireflies Parody | by ilysabeth | Length: | Views: 36 188
06oh, there is a HD option too, if i'm right
WATCH OUT I'M EATING A BAGEL.1800 00000 Fluttershys on the way!
Why is it not the version with Mithent singing... x)
And I don't even like the original song.
BAGELS ARE TASTING GEWD
I even can deal with this song even though I hate it usually
GIMME
Celestia's going to get so mad that she's going to banish you to the moon's moon
Although in fairness, Fluttershy's imbalance was heavily foreshadowed in other episodes (Sonic Rainboom and the cockatrice episode in particular).
Suddenly Fluttershys.
My new song to help me sleep.
this voice is 20% cuter
Fluttershy is awesome
nuff said
Fluttershy snuggling me to sleep... WINGEST BLADE
Dermathil i fight for the liberation of mars death to the EDF so yeah your argument is invalid
/me brohoofs Dman
/me double brohoofs HaveDynomyteWillTravel
eternal boner
;D this song
I keep teelling myself it's just a show,,, but it's way too life.changing for that
Good, Nittany_Tiger_. Don't.
exactly.
I medusa'd a cockatrice because it froze Fluttershy when i brought her into Super Scribblenauts.
Sklar: want a one-way ticket to the Adeptus Mechanicus? They are essentially the only allowed independent group from the Imperium of Man. And they're on Mars.
I must go to my chamber of understanding to identidy this pony ID code
dammit
This whole song is good an all but what happens to contrys that dont love fluttershy
The brony community never ceases to amaze me.
I love all you guys ^_^
sklar We use the orbital friendship cannon on them!
me too
Me neither, Lemons. Without your sympathy I never could've gotten through Bridesmaids
There are MLP Ponies in Super Scribblenauts?
I love you combustiblelemons
you're allowed to feel loved
How did you make Fluttershy in Scribblenauts?
EspyLacopa2 NO?
If there are WHOA
GIC GIC GIC

Dman exactly let them feel the love and toleration in the form of lasors
You just type "Yellow pegasus" and there!You have Fluttershy.
I still haven't finished my Apollo 14 simulation.
yellow pegasus
yes sklar, fire the orbital "laz0r"
/me headbobs Will Ferrel-style, whole neck and hips and all, while sitting.
HAHAHA that was hillarious!
hell type in anything and you'll find ponies eventually.
nothing happened
when we watched austin powers!
dat head
Type "Rainbow Pegasus." Game is 20% cooler.
EPIC times
:(
/me headbobs like churchill dog
Dermathil i am REAPER! your argument is invalid!
you nod you lose.
I lost.
sklar - reaper creeper :P
I LOST

/me headbobs like Mordecai from Regular Show
Sklar: Go back to your necron armies then.
An LP of Scribblenauts using the cast of MLP:FiM to solve problems?
testin' out unusual nodding techniques
I also made Luna appear in Super Scribblenauts.She flew into a tornado and died.
Lol.
they're pretty cool
combustiblelemons: I do neckthrusts as headbobs. You can't beat me.
LOUDER!
XD
Saddest game moment since Harry's death, Destructor :(
EspyLacopa i would so do that but ... wait ... adjectives....HOLY GUACAMOLI
Dman you wouldnt even be able to comprehend what i am creeping for
Harry?
I bob my had sideways!
Harry Benson from Stalker
Never played it.

Sklar I won't. but it was a refference to the DS game TheWorldEndsWithYou aniways
Purple Unicorn, Pink Pony, Yellow Pegasus, Rainbow Pegasus. . .
i whip my head back and forth
I BOB MY HEAD UP AND DOWN I BOB MY HEAD UP AND DOWN
No spoilers.

Alicorn*
: /
dat earbop
also, for some reason the europe strem is always better
now Ican't think of a legendary weapon
twitht
dunno why
Because Europe, Elky
Europe has the best internets that's why.
/me has a holoblade extend from his forearm.
because europe
yes
Also because it's earlier, and we're more alert = more able to enjoy movies
datface
Elky maybe cuz there's less pepole overall, and a higher proportion of viewers are participating in chat
/me continues to bob.
/me has a neckache
The farmers of rock.

show me your hooves
Hurry, he's already gone.
watching mythbusters whilst working is proving counterproductive.
/me continues regardless.

SPRINKLES MY FAVOURITE PMV!

yeah, the fewer people are probably the key factor

Rule #19: The more you hate it the stronger it gets
this song is what combustiblelemons said
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0u1COJ_cFQ
But bronies are all awesomeness and love as far as the eye can see
whats the I thing for
So SirSprinkles,what do you say?
we just don't have all this pointless infighting
Rule no. eyedunnolol. the more you love it the weaker it's hate gets
Their hate makes our love and tolerance stronger.
Proof that rule #19 is true: look at MLP, and look at how many haters there was originally!!!

The bible is the oldest fantasy novel written in the history of mankind. Sadly it was too early for its time and was taken literally by the people. Then it became a philosophy and a religion.

DSNesmith: All my bits on that he fucked the pizza.
I thought that was pretty evident, bjornfot
Dman NSFW?
I know, away from ponies and the internets Dman.
not safe for work, sklar
Is what Razyn said
as for the comments from various mods you can enable "view authors" so you can see who writes what
no need to use colours
(yes, i'm goin on that run later)
04Shiny, what spirit guide would Manly get?
6*shrug*
Wait, later? O_o
Dman: to me outside means with my pony-filled ipod. yeah. I have reached the POINT OF NO RETURN!!! (echo) I can't get away anymore.
just take a peek and you'll understand
6I just find colors easier for when we bring on new mods.
I am a fanfic writer now.

You take some shit, put it up on the wall, check it out for a while. You take that shit up off of the wall, put it down on the floor in a glass bowl. You take some fuck, put it up on the wall where the shit used to be. You take that fuck up off of the wall, put it down on the floor with the shit in a glass bowl What? Yo, here's another little piece of advice-
is it just designed to parody bad rap?
02I'm hurt

the guy who does this is HILLARIOUS dsnesmith
look inta him
is this the same guy behind the WTF collective?
You take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack Take some fuck then some shit then some fuck then some shit You've got a fuck-shit stack A fuck-shit stack
It's a stack of fuck-shit on top of itself, nigga I make references to weaponry, ancient or new. I wear bullet-proof vests for no apparent reason other than to create a false sense of importance of which I could never retain on my own. I like to create a buffer memory of incredulity So y'all motherfuckers could never get near to me.
/me escapes
Now you know how I feel with Hipster's bright yellow text on white. :P
/me flees
I'm a cartoon character. You'll never be able to be like me! (me me) I like women I like women I like the concept of a woman I like to take that concept and reduce it to an object I like to take those objects and put 'em in my videos Have them shake they jiggly bits so they looks like hoes
i think so dsnesmith, but youtube will show you aniways
I like to take some car polish, smear it all over they asses and buff that shit out so it looks like fresh peaches and shit. I like to take some more of that car polish and smear it all over they tits and buff that shit out so it looks all sparkly, like diamond necklaces and shit. Why? Cuz I'm a lady's man a lady's man a la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lady's man
the horror! the horror!
Fluttershy confirmed for fillyfooler.

6And DCD's bright green and Silver's light blue can't be much better.
LL save me D:
I like to take a flat-panel display monitor, put one on the steering column, one inside of the glovebox, one on top of the dashboard, two in back of the headrests, one mounted in the ceiling, two still in the motherfucking packaging, on the back seat so when my motherfucking friends go and sit on the shit and break it (word?) I can honestly say:
so just enable author viewing then ;0
problem solved
6Yeah.

DSNesmith it talking how hip hop and rap are just using unoringinal bullshit and how it just downgrades women and how teaches you to idolize money and materiel objects
This song is so great

You know, it recently started airing in spain too ^^
weird table.
1.Left 4 Speed 2
Dr Who!
Dman: also, the roman vesuvius episode.
for an hour or so
remember that one, Dman?
DERMATHIL you'll love this:
yes
listen
anyone else think NC should seriously take a look at G3 MLP?
2.Leo & Satan - Trash Hazard
No dude, DSN. No.
lol
I studied Latin for 5 years in school, and we saw that episode like 4 times over those 5 years.
12iPad or Android? Not that it matters too much
Unless you mean the Nostalgia Chcik
*Chick
Absolutely true story. and epic
nope, DSN. That'd be the death of him.
Destructure236 love that show
Awesome, Dman.

Although to be fair we played Rome Total War a fair number of times.
XD
i very much disliked my latin teacher, but yea we saw it 4 times in the end
10:/
It'd be interesting to see them do an Old vs. New MLP together, but it'd be more one-sided than the Willy Wonka one.
Hmmm.
Good
i did latin for 3 years and then did latin GCSE prince
lul
carebares... *shudders*
I just watched a crapton of movies during the last year in class. (like, about a dozen, maybe more?)

YOU ARE NOT ALONE
O SHI
I dunno, I like just about all the Tennant episodes.
yeah.
The tennant-centric episodes are always kicking ass.
Yana for was good because WHAT A TWEEST!

I literally shat a brick when I saw that episode.
Also I liked the Master because of the actor, same as life on mars main character.

They know that a naked person's gonna make the others laugh whatever happens, taking them out of their stupor?
Interesting excuse. XD
I suppose that could work.
Wait wut.
Bearing in mind they have just lost a third of their staff.
Oh.
I've got some sort of warped logic at times that can succesfully explain that kind of plot holes.
LOL
Royal family on the roof.

this broadcast can be interpreted as a call to the best medical doctor on the planet by non-knowing people.
Lol, yeah.

>LOL USA THINKS THEY RULE THE WORLD
EeeeeeeeeNOPE
They look JUST like us.
XD
aka CANADIAN
exactly
so they don't deserve to be leading.
Compared to Britain, but I won't pretend to know history anyway. XD
USA don't have any history worthy of mention.
Canada was a british colony before it recieved its independence WITHOUT VIOLENCE.
we were so liked by the british that we were offered our independence.
well not really
03DDDDD:
Ziltoid: care to elaborate?
IMO it would be better if at least USA stayed a colony.
If I remember anything at all
IN quebec atleast there was a war
Bjornfot: the US's history is all-over the guns.
Ziltoid: that was was in 1760. That's when we went from the french to the English
Right
Apart from that, no independence war.
We didn't separate from the British empire through war.
EPICNESS MOMENT RIGHT THERE
At least Canada understands that you can get your ways without HURR DURR VIOLENCE
exactly.
Well, we could understand that before our current prime minister.
That guy's almost as bad as Bush in my eyes.
lol
"olololololololo"
U so stupid
Nope
,jpg
Does Canada have a greed problem?
Nittany_Tiger: we have got a prime minister who's a huge conservative dick.
eeyup
HECK YES
jets are cool lets buy some
At least you're not destroying the world for profit.

Oh, well done Dman. XD
Danke Schon
rofl
megavideo
same here.
ofc, dermathil : )
Dermathil and his rawkit Lawnchair is always gonna be around to lend a hand.
that poster would look ugly if it weren't for you
if they have the clip you can just download it instead of streaming, won't count towards the limit
the bronystate thing
yeah
bjornfot i haven't a clue about downloading and megavideo. Just never done that before
HER YES
i have only seen like 10 torchwood eps before, this one NOT included
06so if it crashes I just start it all over again pretty much? :P
this shud b intredesting
Dman: torchwood being aimed at older audience, it is very awesome.
TORCHWOOD
Dermathil : ok then
OH MAH GAWD
>IMPLYING TORCHWOOD
MFW everything is an anagram in Doctor Who.
and yeah
06mkay
I might write a few scripts so you can just execute them instead of having to go burp
FFFF
you're right dari.
oh
my
:P
god
Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who
fffff
Eeyup.
. . . .
double doses of doctor.
no .. no it isn't .. no no no
nonononono
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
hahahahaha
/me 's mind has exploded all over the walls
06that would work too, as it's just to start it up again afterall~
CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS
HOW DID I NEVER SEE THIS!
Any way to turn up the volume?
yeah, but it'd be preferably to kill the old process
>dat face
of _ _
as seeing as it'll still be up and nomming CPU and RAM
MFW I thought everyone knew that anagram. :P
06that's how I close most programs anyway soooo
(who is also gay. If he hadn't been all the girls would've been jumping on him)
/me dies
THE GLOVE
HECK YES THE GLOVE
lmao
Dermathil you're wrong >_<
He's bi
and bispecie
well you have to find the PID of it and then kill that
and everything :P
Dman: he is? Oh I forgot then.
and it IS more complicated than windows so derp
omniesexual
06I blame firefox for that. And yeah, I have no experience with linux so derp
lul dermathil yes he is he literally hits on anything
Though Ianto IS gay though.
04Can I has your steam :3
ziltoid is correct ^_^
I have no steam lol
06xD
Any way to make it louder?
I just run the TF2 server
>machines bringing the dead for 60 seconds. deep bro
I cant spell anything right
IRL he's gay.

nope, nittany.
In Torchwood he's bi.

Everything Changes is the name of the episode.
Because I'm awesome and can do anything with computers. :P
I wish i could help out. I don't know how good you are with comps, but I like to help
03oh hey that's cool, the Blu-Ray of HP7.1 actually has a resume feature, something most Blu-Rays have been lacking
Guess what it relates to.

WATCH THE STREAM NOW
OK SIR
AWESOME SCENE

BTW I mean that I can only make 3D graphics, not that I can only code with them.
06the pass you gave me is just
06denied

Try again
3D is a pain to code
'good mask sorta fing'
I just read the Wikipedia article on it. Sounds interesting.
:)
'stop being silly'
06doesn't work lol
._.
>typical british blabbermouth
/me goes to turn off his AC.

ADULT ENOUGH FOR YOU DMAN?
06username thing I just copypasted so that's idiot-proof
WOW that would NEVER APPEAR IN DR WHO
06and I did case-sensitive on the pass too
exactly
haha you posted that as i was typing that
Yeah, torchwood is a bit more adult.
weird
do you have teamviewer?
or VNC
this torchwood. this summer of nothing planned.
hmm
this magical power of finding vids online
: D
Reminds me of the Torchwood episode where the alien kills people by having sex with them.
Dman: they even got a cybermen in one of the episodes.
06nope. And I disconnect after ~2 minutes every time as well.
I remember that one dari.
succubus?
Good episode.
._.
Dermathil cybermen are quite cool
ANyone watch fringe?
can you download teamviewer or something?
If it's male, it's an incubus.
i'm trying to remember i can't remember the 10 odd i've see nat all
06yeah I can
Dman: a woman that was part cybermen and that tried to make others into cybermen. We see the people mid-stuff.
thanks
if it's captain jack harkness it's captainjackharknesscubus
yes
dermathil oh wow
Dman: it is in season 2 or 3 that episode about the alien having sex killer.
hmm
/me walks in
umm
oh hai mark
Lol.
Hi.
ohai Polarfire. TORCHWOOD EPISODE TIME
humm
06okay installed and stuffs
alright
ohai everypony
open it and give me the ID and pass
This episode is pretty quiet on my computer compared to normal.
: /
this episode is booming whenever I play it
they don't speak loud in the episode is all.
on volume i'm hearing livestream
But the buttons are pretty loud on my computer.
Why don't you use an amplifier program?
Yet quiet in stream.
06lol hang on I didn't even see the new pass you gave me in the pm lol...
yea but dermathil i'm on 100% volume and when I Play it native mah pc it's LOUDDDD O GOD then low livestream
06I tried the old one x.x
To be fair it depends your speaker volume.
Just amplify all outgoing audio...
lmfao
It's the stream, yeah.
Bjornfot: Like I said I could use VAC.
: / i cna't help at all then really
But meh.
Dman: I'm 100% volume though, on the physical sound control on my headset, on my sound controls, on my keyboard, on my screen, 4 layers of 100% sound.
I'll set it up some other time.
then stop being lazy dari
06and that worked ofc
I am going to try an experiment with aDosBox
lets see how good it really is
oh bjornfot
you so silly
oh heck yeah, the pizza delivery scene. Good one.
can it run Windows 95 and Windows 3.11?
Dermathil wow 4 layers. so i'm 100percent too and i can barely hear, but still hear, this stream
03a few of the reviews say it's really sluggish
Pizza Time
So when is the Tf2 game? xD
I hear the stream, but I don't hear it loud.
needs to be about 20% louder
Look, I'll set up VAC or something for next week...
this scene is one of the awesomer in the pilot.
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-dk1axrNmqU/S1Zp-_jf0oI/AAAAAAAAKFU/uaGj2DPEzxk/s400/pizzatime.jpg
Dermathil same
hah
06okay, now I think I got the server started at least =w=
06and somehow I accidentally whoised people okay
There's nothing to compare.
03oh
I've got the volume setting at 100% for everything.
03question
but there's so many livestream settings to tweak? oh ok then
06yay it's up
: /
03how do I see connects/disconnects without being oper?
welcome, to the HUB
Do you use the same streaming program?
Yes.
Dermathil this the hub?
THE HAND!
The Torchwood hub.
NO
yes, the hand
uh...
is that genuinely the same hand?
No wai
Eeyup.
I thought this was the brony HUB?
I think it is.
technically you only need the cF snomasks
Jack kept it.
hmm I expected this room to be empty pretty much
03I know there's +E for the whois thing
but anyway
why am i a huge fan of dr who yet never got into torchwood
03but that seems to only work when someone's on the same server I am
wow i thought the master just took it
03if it's the other server, nothing happens :/
different target audience?
and yes, ocean needs it installed
i dunno
03oh
03well
Dman: because torchwood is for older people?
03I couldn't have +W without being oper, could I?
i always thought 'torchwood sucks it's to fill in when dr who aint on' but never saw it
03just because people \are bawwing over me being opered up right now
: (
(Though I did start watching torchwood at 4 years old)
03but I like having those alerts
03etc
woops, I just killed the TF2 server
it has no doctor
: /
thta may be a reason why
06WALLOPS EVERYWHERE
06and how
06did you do that D:
Dman: it's got Jack Harkness.
And they do reference the doctor at multiple times.
pizza under the name of torchwood : D
Also, Martha Jones makes a few cameos
03LOL wallops?
and yea Dermathil it sure has
yea i saw them ones or some of those
Following the character's initial introduction in the revived Series One of Doctor Who, the character became incredibly popular with fans,[6][102][142] to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, Torchwood, primarily centred around the character
so this show is about jack?
yeah
/me 7grabs a cup of apple juice.
oh i thout it was about many people here
oh ok
and ya lul
Dman: well about him and this specific girl here.
The only two main characters of the pilot to still be around after The children of earth
It's about the whol torchwood team. :P
whole*
PTERODACTYL
So none watches fringe?
nope
Nope.
sadface
07o.o
' In "The Parting of the Ways", Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips,[5] the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the programme.' lol wikipedia
/me 7returns. o.O
7Hey, Kyu!
hehehe
06mfw the lugia.us server is the one in my fav list with the best ping
Dermathil: oh i see so that's pilot ep and she introduced?
ok
07lol
06I feel spoiled
and nope, I didn't
yeah
lmao
/me pats Greg
This is the first episode in the torchwood series.
/me rolls
7Lol.
7Well, you're in Europe.
06yes and most people are
06not
06so xD
7I have a feeling the CaliClan will be a little less pleased. XD
maybe
uh
TV seriously needs more lgbt
the server is in germany
:x
06CURVE THE BULLET time
07lol o3o
06because lag compensation is totally fair
Bjornfot: we are still in a period of time where they were only recently equalized in society.
it's a pretty fast server
7It's better than having laggy people get killed all the time./
and diversity in general
06Yes it is, but it does lead to some amusing headshot-around-corners moments.
In about two more decades this should have more diversity. At most in half a century.
In USA, maybe. We're far ahead in the rest of the world.
06And backstabbed-mid-rocketjump
History takes time to write itself.
06but it's the lesser of two evils for sure :p
7Ahem.
USA is ahead?
Wut.
USA is way too conservative and hurr durr.
^^
UK forthewin
7Can I guess you have IRC invites off?
i guess
that and the canadian Prime Minister. He's also ultra-conservative.
prince, re-read my sentence, i thinkk you got it wrong
06LOL
06I probably do if you're asking me LOL
06xD
This backdoor was my first awesome feeling for the series.
06oh nvm
06I just didn't see them
7Lol.
oh yeah we're conservative that's why we're trillions of dollars in the hole.
it's kinda hard to see
:p
because nobody looks at their status window
bjornfot where you from?
no that's just because you suck
Sweden
i see
06it doesn't go 4red6 sooo
now i can understand that sentence
XD
it goes blue
or brown
prince dari i may want sleep soon as i g2 get up at 10 and not sleep for a day : (
or some other colour depending on your theme
06blue because blue = top tier
We're like, the LGBTQ-friendliest countries ever.
i'm tireeeeeed
Ok.
here in scandinavia
Who feels bad for Oslo?
/me 7pokes Feather
/me 7pokes not-here Aurora.
I don't mind homosexuals. I mind them showing off their homosexuality. I don't really care to hear about their sexual preference.
Oslo?
except finland, they've had too much russia influence
06and oi I should probably change my spray a bit...
/me hides
Dman: the terrorist attack on Oslo
I don't mind them, they can do what they want. I just don't like it when they go 'I'M GAY OK DEALWITHIT JEES IT'S TWENTYFIRST CENTURY AND I'M GAY SO WHAT LEAVE ALONE YES I'M GAY' 'iml ike ok ok
80 kids gunned down on an island, 7 deaths to a bomb attack.
oh
06oh sh-
nittany_tiger/ My thoughts exactly
Speaking of which... there should really be some fillyfooling in FiM.
yes i heard about that
7?
and mentioned it here actualy
06"The server you're connecting to is running an older version of the game"
it makes incredibly much sense
o_O
well
the vphysics.so is from an old version
Bjornfot: no there shouldn'T be fillyfooling in FiM. No relations altogether except the comedic Spike-rarity. This is still a kids show.
and kids need to be taught that it's not wrong or disgusting or against some fictional character's will
there's no real relationship muc hin FIM at all
unless a new version of the server has come out since 2 days ago
06well, yes
we see pinkie's parents twi's parents um
As much interwebs coverage it gets, kids still watch it.
06mmhmm
it shouldn't be an issue
aj's auntuncle
06update today
-___________-
06in fact physics involving FLOATING DISSOLVING PEOPLE
mr and mrs cake
06xD
To see fillyfooling we'd need a scene on screen.
there's not exactly a million straight relationships as is
god damn it
Dman: People see Lyra and Bonbon.
but yea fillyfooling in the show or coltcuddling for that matter would be fun to watch
So, why no (obvious) same-sex pairs?
Dermathil lolyes, quite accepted in fanbase, but canon? : /
:P
theres lara and bonbon
Lyra and BonBOn is confrimed for coincidence
sort of
see, derpy became canon. djpon3 became canon, but lyra x bonbon hastn't yet : /
how's it going?
06what I don't get is
dari: i hear your windows noises :P
06we could connect earlier today
DUN
Bjornfot: no obvious pairs because the parents haven'T explained what that is yet to their kids.
It's people highlighting me. :P
well the server crashed
^
in what?
His IRC client
Good thanks.
I thinm I'm going to continue watching all the episodes again tonight
cuz msn doesn't make that noise or face book or steam or ... oh ok
How about you?
Ahh, nice. :D
it's been a while since I've watched them
so what dermathil
Chatzilla does that.
I'm good too
thanks for asking
my computer doesn't DOM when people say Dman?
STOP HIGHLIGHTING ME
xP
GOD
hahah
lol
HAHA
xDDD
this is the new spam
how do I join this fun?
last one I watched was Dragonshy
Most kids only know that boys and girls are supposed to be together.
alright I'm stopping.
do you know offhand which episode comes next?
dan dan
(trying to make tunes with DUN)
i'll stop now
Hmm.
Nope.
I'll consult the MLP wikli
*wiki
:P
oh also
>music
TORCHWOOD THEME
What if some kid gets a crush on someone of the same sex think he's a freak because he's never heard of such a thing, only ever seen opposite-sex relations on cartoons?
06Yeah
Dragonshy episode 7 I think.
Bjornfot: then that's the parent's job to explain that.
I use reddit, and look what I discovered earlier this week http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony
bjornfot you are such a troll :p

GOGOGOGOGO
hahah
HAVE NO FEAR DMAN IS HERE
and HAhahaha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZn8-4wqqw
lol
and yes, i found another link in 10 seconds flat. Jelly?
ok here we go
/me is helping mods. :3
ooh yay
MFW that's miracle day again?
the slumber party episode is next
I can understand why you don't want to focus on relationships in a kids cartoon... but if there's "normal" innocent crushes, why can't there be same-sex ones?
miracle day?
It's the BBC page.
With miracle day.
http://www.novamov.com/video/k21fjalxlgouc
:P
novanov
no it's novanov >_<
yes this one
Gonna go on drawball dont mind me
http://two.drawball.com/
so far so good
:P
Homosexuality should not be considered or portrayed as odd or abnormal.
doo eet : )
SUDDENLY kissing
I think putting same-sex relationships in the cartoon (or in any cartoon) will just create a shitstorm of backlash.
lol
'do you wanna do that really' 'you basterd'
but no luck
Bjornfot: it isn't, just a matter that is needed to be explained by the parents to the children, not by a cartoon aimed at 5-years olds.
Especially when the conservatives of my religion get word of this.
putting homosexuality in a kids cartoon...
I need to change the mounting for the /sdcard/ directory
Yes it will, Nittany_Tiger_. But why? Because of fat old conservative bastards. Who should die.
wait...when i say your name everypony hears DUN. i'l stop calling you then by ur name :(
XD
Bjornfot: also, the television industry probably would censor the episode.
O BOI HURR WE GO
louder video
Bjornfot are you communist?
Why should the parents have to explain something that's pretty usual?
sowwee. i found this vid in 10 secs flat. must become 20% faster thus find vids in 8 seconds flat
hell no polarfire i'm libertarian
Capitalist greed sometimes makes me want to become socialist.
so Dermathil any other cool scenes left here?
Capitalism<>Right-wing
I'm already almost put off by republicans.
not that I remember.
Of
Pony<>Pony
And then they fucked
what just happened?
I'm not saying we should force cartoons to incorporate homosexuality... I'm just saying that it would be good if they did.
As far as political parties go, I have none.
We shouldn't force anything on anyone.
I found a video a while back that was all the episodes in one video
Forcing things on people makes people angry.
I have my set of beliefs about anything and everything anyone would want to discuss, and I stick to them.
If you want FiM to get shut down FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEER it's a good idea. :P
it was nice not having to click the next episode on the list
can't find it now
^that
LOL
i agree a little with bjornfot, it would be cute to see lyra kiss bonbon on the cheek or something
wut
oh
Bjornfot: it is just something that is usually taboo around kids. Both hetero and Homo.
spoke too soon
There's your homosexuality Bjornfot.
it wouldn't be shut down if people used their brains a little and stopped being derp
Same sex kissing, you happy? :P
It would be creepy in the show.
FOR THE RECORD I'M STRAIGHT >_< desu
FOR THE RECORD I'M OMNISEXUAL DESU
it would be either creepy as hell, polarfire, or really really cute cuz of vector animashun
straight too.
HARKNESS ON ROOF IS AWESOME
There isn't even any hetero kissing in MLP.
THAT I REMEMBER NOW
And I'm tolerant of all sexual preferences.
haha, now everpony doesn't want doubts around their sexuality so eveyone's just saying
And religions.
And I don't see why there should be any kissing at all.
i'm tolerant ... and loving badumtiss
there shouldn't
The only thing I don't tolerate is hate against my religion.
i'm ok with season 2 not having kisses
Which is growing.
And upsetting.
guess why nittany, guess why
unless...rarity kissing spike on cheek for thankyou CIUUUUUTE
Conservative extremists.
I know why.
It's because many religious people are conservative idiots. homophobes and such
seeing lyra kiss bon bon is something I would not mind seeing made by the animators per-say. However I DON'T want to see it in the show anytime soon.
Wait, when does Rarity kiss Spike?
because it would be creepy as hell
i'm saying it wud be cute in season 2
she doesn't
On Monday probably Sprinkles.
it would be cute in season 2 >_< just a peck on cheek for thanks. cuz we were talking about season 2 kissing
Sprinkles ok
primary bl4d3
Dermathil or prince does this have stuff like dr who where some season 1 thing apperas in season 3/4/5?
But anyway... Spike has an innocent crush on Rarity...
IT WORKS
yeah, Dman.
DOSBOX FOR ANDROID WILL BOOT WINDOWS 95!

What's the best torrent program?
uTorrent
FMA's one?
duno
I can't say. I hate torrents for robbing my interweb.
I used to use BitTorrent.
arguable, but there are genuinely massive differences in speed that can be achieved
WHO SAID DARIS NAME
lolwat dermathil
drf has a santrex FTP
i use bittorrent just because
03yeah, the one I'm letting you use
i used to use utorrent
03EW, no, Santrex is horrible, igniore them
03-i
#1 video on the "suggested videos" list: Top 5 sexiest Pokemon
wut
i don't have a prefference
O.o
03anyway deleted
Bjornfot: my internet is capped, and I get tops of 300$/month.
what
you pay 300 a month?
I'm not a torrenter, but I used to be.
also dermathil if it's capped and you're on a livestream isn't that rather taxing?
And, honestly, trying to be an honest consumer doesn't lead anywhere anymore.
Dermathil... then automatically stop the torrent after it's done? Prevent it from seeding?
Dman: 300$/month for going over the cap.
Except exploitation and accusation.
nittany i still buy loads of torrentable stuff of course
oh ouch dermathil
we are also 3 heavy internet users on the same broadband
well its working
is'nt a livestream taxing? so much video?
whewre do you live?
I just got a functional GUI
The last game I torrented was one I already owned on another system.
Quebec, Canada
Can it explore internet?
i have unlimited which is, you know, nice
DID I HEAR SHIT
wait that cant be right
that wouldn't appear on dr who
I don't think WIFI tunneling works in this version
yes, Dman.
dermathil wow
Any bigger cap than what we already have and we get the business contract
thats only for uploads right?
>resurrection for the whole world isn't taht good. that's the worst idea ever mate
suddenly, guy out of the ground
for me just the fact that I have a working GUI is impressive

It should eb noted that he missed one Leverage, though.
It's with that long-tongue woman.
Ah.
CRAPLOUSY CEILING.
This movie missed one or Ghosties missed it?
"A female, getting leverage?"
This video.
Ghosties counted one too many. XD
this video missed one
yup
eeyup. did you also get it to 12? i did
Yeah, but I think he missed on early on to make up for it though.
PIZZA CAKE
PIZZA CAKE
PIZZA CAKE
ahaha
It was 2 and 3 in this movie. I think he missed one of those because they were too close together.

I don't think there were costumes.
DONT SHOW IT
Maybe I saw a video that wasn't pony related and my mind has just assumed it must be since I've been doing nothing but ponying.

Hey
does your mom know you are a brony?
you are damn late
^_^
nittany?
Nope.
Oh god no.
nope.avi
Come out now.
lol
We should watch some 3.5G episode sometime.
My family knows.
My family is clueless
I thought of sending her a pony episode, but I decided not too.
how many of these videos are there?
Honestly, it's no big deal to me if she finds out.
yeah -_-
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZGajz8cgi4
hmm
Gottta share?
YOU GOTTA CARE!
YOU GOTTA SHARE!
lmfao drf
its the right thing to do
I find it funny how adults liking Spongebob (including my mom) was not nearly as negatively received as adults loving MLP.
LOL
OH SHI-
YOU GOTTA CAAAARE!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o3TTuGrYuQ
fukc der poliec
I don't think my family knows just how much pony stuff I watch, but they do know a little.
Unless MLP is being spammed everywhere.
I've dropped a few pony memes into conversations before
You gotta shaaaarrreeee
but my family isn't meme savvy XD
I haven't done any brony memes in verbal conversations. Just here and there on the internet.
03DR. MARIO.
MySpace is the ghetto of the internet now isn't it?
lmao
Worst was when I was streaming Orbiter on Tinychat.
Myspace is a ghost town.
I hum and play pony tunes on the piano all the time
I changed my nick to "Lunarescuesquad" since I was doing an Apollo mission.
I was there XD
^
Yeah.
Dari was there albeit silent.
I did talk a bit. :P
I still haven't finished the run.
Yeah.
I was pretty silent also
I wonder if I could find and insert a Luna Statue at the landing site.
That'd be cool.
I would have to make one in the format that Orbiter accepts.
well im off everypony goodbye
bye ziltoid
bye bye ziltoid
I want a bracelet with a cross and RD cutie mark.
LOL and Livejournal is the ancient abandoned ruins!
Oooh! I know this vid!
*Derp*
Would it be made out of black marble? 'Cause that would be EPIC
Get a shirt with just the cutie mark on it...Rainbow Dash's, for example
And make sure it's a blue shirt
Too open.
really?
I'm quite a shy person.
awwwr *patpat*
then get something fluttershy related x3
You're probably a really cool person
I'd not really comfortable telling my friends.
Maybe.
Get a shirt with the word "Yay" written in really small letters!
Since they might tell other people and other people aren't always so nice. :P
A small one like those you get at McDonalds.
other people are never nice
I know a few people in real life that I might be willing to talk about it with, but I don't think I'd bring it up myself.
On the internet, bronies unite
irl we are alone : P
Yeah.
I'm gunna get a pony shirt.
and rl is a scary place
I'd on wear it going out with family though.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLDmI3ieauo non-pony but hell yes!
I've met some bronies IRL before...we talked about being bronies and looked at the pics I had on my laptop
not safe like the internet
I so want to meet some PA residents before I leave next year.
And hope I don't run into any friends. XD
I know a lot of PA residents online.
But I haven't met any.
There's quite a few bronies down here in Georgia
Mutual owning
038
12yeh i now
The only people I've met IRL from online are storm chasers.
stop complaining.
12know
you have no complaining rights if you live in USA
Oh here we go again Bjornfot. :P
there's super many bronies there
How about Canada?
I have plenty to complain about in the USA.
nope
bjornfot you are such a troll : P
Just not brony-related issues.
Aw, where are you from Bjorn?
VIKING COUNTRY
oh yes Nittany_Tiger_, you have. but not about there being no bronies
Bjornfot is techno viking
Do you have an epic bear Bjornfot?
eeyup

Maybe "Love and Tolerance" can fix this fucking country.
....TROLL COUNTRY! (^_^)V
nah
Aww.
it's kinda puny
I'm only 18

I'm 10 years on you.
/me takes rhat out of context

/me returns from cubeworld

I can grow a decent goatee, but that's it.
and I usually shave it
MFW I'm always the youngest person.
but just not now cause it's summer brake
now with lower sodium
I have john lennon sideburns :3
I'm nearly the steretypical brony. Just not super-obsessed with the show.
What is the stereotypical brony?
I have a full beard and mustache.
oh XD
I'm in the Navy...we can't have facial hair.
bbl
But I don't think I'd ever grow a real beard... it would decrease my chances of getting laid.
I just got back from a four-year stationing in Japan and Southeast Asia
That depends entirely on the beard.
Haters cast them as unemployed men in their 20s or 30s.
Well, that's Fox.
I PONYTIZED AT LEAST TWO JAPANESE WOMEN!
^_^
Actually, I haven't gotten laid since pony, but w/e
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwKclhWlo-0
I liked the Fox coverage.
I'm a virgin.
I managed to get two people online hooked on pony.
That's it so far.
inb4 nittany waits until marriage
No-one likes Fox news except idiots.
12drf ;-;
I'm actually very interested in a girl I know online.
I'm just afraid to tell her I like her.
Especially since she's admitted that she's not into relationships.
But we are good friends.
i smell skyping
I didn't say I liked Fox news. :P
"Not into relationships?" lol
I said I liked what they said.
I was having a wonderful correspondence with a nice young woman on Flankbook via messages...but then the damn site went down!
12i smell....
12nothing, i want food ;-;
I wasn't into relationships until I was 25.
Oh, does she mean she don't want to get all serious and tied up?
I was 100% school for a long, long time.
No. She's introverted like me.
If so, then you're DAMN lucky! Go get her, tiger!
Which I like introverts.
Be a gentleman!
I do. I be myself.
:D
that's always the best
I try to make her happy when she's down.
The only downside is that she can get confrontational.
ugh, women
Women are women. That's what makes them so interesting
always something.
And infuriating
Meh.
I have no desire to pursue any relationship with anyone.
They're not interesting, they're annoying. Most of the time.
I am the type of person who is happier by myself
actually, about 6.25% are pretty cool
I see myself as rare type of person who's more into having a relationship than sex, which I have zero interest in.
Not me, I'm a total Pinkie Pie sort of brony
Relationships, I dunno, random fun at parties is a go though. :D
But most are just so... complicated... and stuff
I don't do social meetings.
Guys are much better. No complications.
Oh hey! Non-shaky cam! http://media.nick.com/mgid:cms:video:nick.com:933818
forever alone :<
Why not Nittany?
Being introverted makes it hard to make friends.
I'm just not a social person.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRCvzTubC8
join the dark side nittany, you'll increase your chances dramatically
Because living off campus my first year of university was a big mistake.
I try to be a times.
I tend to be shy around people I don't know.
Around my friends though? Nope.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Kl0Gr1VYQ
Know that feeling.
Naw, Tiger, that just means you're mature
When you get past the hormones you realize how nice it is just to have someone who'll accept you for who you are and hold you at the end of the day and tell you they love you before you both just pass out....am I right?
Just kinda hard to figure out what to talk about with people you don't know. :/
Oh, and not very far into a party shyness = gone anyway.
*cheerio
12gee how nice
Maturity can suck, but thanks.
^
In 6 months, I might be in an office job, which will suck because I can't be casual anymore.
inorite
I'm such a generous person
Nor possibly take 2-week trips to chase storms.
Unless I land a job in tornado alley.
I need to make money off of that if possible. Some people do by selling video and streaming live.
The people I chased with did live streaming.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p50-oWY1pFE&feature=related
I'm not very social irl
but I can find something to talk about with pretty much anybody.
who needs to be social anyway?
there is internet
I could never get anyone in the Penn State meteo dept to go on a plains chase with me.
Human beings are by their nature social creatures
Yeah.
I get bored quickly if I don't have someone or a small group to talk with.
That's why it gets boring quickly in my apt since I live alone.
But I'm shy in big groups and don't like attention.
I get bored quickly if I don't have internet.
I though of having a roommate, but it may not work out.
Because I like privacy as well.
That's why it's good to have an extraverted friend who'll help you fit in
I liked most of my roommates in college.
Sadly most of my friends are fairly introverted too...
lol I just realized the instructions that came with my hard drive are in engrish
03and, done with HP7.1
Well, I want to help the girl I like become less introverted.
03now I get to wait til tomorrow to see part 2 XD
FAQ3: "Drive does not be recognized in BIOS setup"
The thing is, some people like to push introverts into becoming extroverts. That's not how you do it.
"Confirm whether BIOS setup became correctly"
I like talking 1 on 1 with people. I want to know their beliefs, their customs, what problems they have right now and what's going good in their lief, etc.
They have to do it on their own.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnTPsNAutKY
03anyway bbl on desktop
"Even though the HDD recognized in BIOS setup, it does not be seen in Windows"
there's gotta be an all your base in here somewhere.
Though she can be quiet.
I found that the best thing was just to be andnotasinglefuck.jpg about what people think of you.
^
Sometimes hard.
Yes
It is hard
But that's what makes you cool...people KNOW how hard it is, and you get respect for that
I don't care what people think about me.
I wouldn't change a single thing about my looks, my life, etc.
I'm not ashamed of being a brony either.
I have never given a fuckshitstack about what people think about me.
i like how a lot of things are in engrish nowadays
12o-o
You're pretty cool people.
I just don't announce it to the world like gay people announce their sexuality
I'm not ashamed I'm totally in love with Fluttershy. Not a damn bit.
Duh, we're all cool people. :P
I 90% DGAF about what others think of me.
we're bronies
But I won't do nutty things in public.
^
Though I want to at times.
we are cool
we are the coolest of the cool
We're bronies. We have CLASS.
like that
Bronies are so damn cool.
and stuff
Yes.
Classy like Gummy
:D
Classy like Spike in a tux!
I was bullied throughout all of elementary school for having long hair. But I didn't give a single fuck.
We're real men. ;)
hell yeah!
MFW most people in my school have long hair.
Myself included, though I really need to get it cut.
Ugh bullying.

I'm around the best people in my academic dept.
There's a time and a place for everything, children, and it's called COLLEGE.
12hiii
I've never met a person I've hated in college.
03sup
Even people that used to bully me.
And we got along fine.
There used to be a kid who bullied me in elementary school, all the time...now, I'm actually two feet taller than him.
Oddly enough, agreed with that. I've met a lot more people in college and can't think of any that I really didn't like.
12horrible
12downloading TF2 and trying to watch youtube at the sametime
people used to cheat off me and I would let them...
Plenty of them in high school though. :/
03LOL
Clemson and Penn State have friendly professors.
but then I stopped.
Heh, I remember that happening in my programming classes.
03is it normal on a tooth with a filling in it, where if I touch that tooth it hurts a lot?
12maybe
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D93SvHXLWCs
Some are friends.
12usually fillings aren't supposed to hurt
03hm
12unless they are brand new
03I wonder what it would be then
I think that's normal for the first day or two.
03well
hey dari, giggle at the ghosties 20% cooler remix?
03I've had it for a few weeks
03but
else it might be a sign you need more than one lol
I ended up finished the 100+ little programs that we had to write about a month into the semester. I had people trying to steal my programs every time I got up from my computer.
03it's in the very very far back tooth that I can't really reach with a toothbrush
I'm just playing the links in order.
Oh wow
03and it seems to only start hurting in the presence of sugar
12any tooth is reachable
ok
12well drf
03DARN YOU FEATHER
I played a lot of Liero that year...
12my teeth are sensitive to cold
12x-x
so are you gonna make me dig up a link XD
@classmeter Jaunty_Scribbles
6 Jaunty_Scribbles is 46% class. (529)
03heh
12you can imagine how irritating it is to be in a hot summer day
I don't recall people cheating on me.
Eeyup.
12and cold water hurts
Oh wow, I went up 10 points!
03I just dunno if I should go back to the dentist
I recall people asking for help in Math.
03and be like fix this filling plz
12well...
still got ya beat : P
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMizcECkwXs
Also, how I aced basic C.
12what is the harm in going to the dentist and just asking them to look at it
Since coding is just logic.
12to get their opinion
03it costs money
03XD
o-o
I'm not logical at all
and time lol
12they can't really charge you if they didn't do anything
it bores me
12can they?
I'm a math and science person.
^
/me shot
03I once had a doctor charge us $100 just for telling me my nails were too short, and that's why my fingers hurt
I'll slave through something computer related because I like computers though
I love coding, and everything about computers.
I love maths and sciences.
If I could get myself to actually do my homework I'd be stronger in math than I am.
12heh
I love computers and cars
I love the weather and astronomy. I love math.
word, dari
I aced everything up to discrete math, which I goofed off in.

03heh
I'm ok at math
03don't feel like turning my speakers on
03sorry XD
but it bores me
I aced everything up until high school when I goofed off.
I would love to show my discrete math teacher where I am now.
12then watch it in mute
I love solving something really hard in maths.
I aced everything in high school
I also like academia.
First year I ended up with high 50's to low 60's
Gives me a great sense of gratification.
I hate math
Yeah.
math is almost as fun as programming
I'm just boring like that I guess
I remember figuring out things on my own just for fun.
^
both are pure logic
I love history, literature, and sociology
But unfortunately, I would find out that someone else did it before me.
but mechanical stuff. not math.
also, finding out stuff someone already founf out ftw
Scribbles: yes :)
Not really. I want to pioneer at least one idea.
Maybe within my current work with lightning.
I'm not in college right now because I'm still in the Navy, but when I get out i want to major in Sociology and Anthropology
12night all
The elder scrolls
I understand mechanics and how things work, and that interests me
Oh, and I love music!
but not math :p
MFW the most interesting classes in Uni I've taken are HR related, for someone that doesn't deal with people much.
Even though I'm doing a statistical study, there's still a lot of fun in figuring out what the results mean.
ahaha dari, did you really stream that?
Apparently so.
I make the musics
That's me singing.
Ahah, cool.
Did you see my first ever tornado?

MFW we kicked your asses Bjornfot.

MFW we asked for our indepenence nicely and got it.
12i have a problem
;)
MFW I can't spell independance
And I still don't have it. :/
bye polar
03LOL what
LOL!
after this song...
>mfw by polar = bipolar
that doesn't sound like a problem
that sounds like a solution.
lol
and I'm not bipolar at all
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2FIL7Uv4M
I'm pretty much 1-emotion
i'm pretty much 0-emotion
i hate emotional people
yeah. I thought so.
emotion is mankinds greatest weakness
it often hinders us
British army fights 3 big battles in a short space of time.
yeah it does but there's a reason for it :P
socialism and communism are great examples of why we shouldn't let ourselves be controlled by emotions
And only loses to the last army because of misfortune. :P
how the fuck is communism emotional
HERP DERP EVEYONE EQUAL
Noweigans got owned at Stamford bridge.
Logic>Emotions
12a solution to what then?
that doesn't have anything to do with emotion.
12and yes drf
12i like spicy food that much
03heh
12!alert 54650
yes
And I'm not defending communism at all btw
03I don't like spicy food x.x
!alert 54650

12i know

Severe Thunderstorm Watch till 2:00 AM CDT on July 24, 2011
spicy food is awesome lol
Why are people communists?
communism is a state of mind.
Not because of logic.
It's a good idea.
COmmunism is irrational and very bad logic.
12i agree
But it's flawed.
It's because of EMOTION!
Because it inhibits individuality.
just the other day I had that spicy chili I always make.
And it's totalitarian.
Because DAWWWWWWWWWWW we must take care of everyone!!!!11
It has been implimented in greatly impoverished countries as a means or human survival
It was the first time my brother had some.
unsuccessfully
everyone is equal hargblargl
Neither just using logic, or just using emotion works in real life.
He took maybe one bite and then went back to the kitchen to get milk.
that made me happy.
Also implying logic isn't affected by emotion.
Communism is does NOT have to be totalitarian.
it is poor logic but I don't see emotion behind communism. Only bad judgement
it is dari
true true dari
that's our weakness
that's what we must try to overcome
now I gotta go guys quit bringing me back XD
to to break free form the bonds of emotion
bye everyone
see you tomorrow and monday
Meh.
to kick emotion in the face and embrace ture logic, when needed
like, in politics
Eeeeh.
cool
I'd rather kick pleasure out the door.
For politics.
12http://www.accuweather.com/us/radar/sir/wi_/radar.asp?play=true
if one used pure logic one would quickly realize that socialism is completely irrational
12drf, tell these blasted storms to go away
MFW no one system is perfect anyway.
that a free market and a free people is required for a true democracy
MFW I'm living under corrupt Democracy and rampant oligopolies.
Hiya.
Constitutional Monarchy!
The ideal system WOULD be anarchy. It would never work, though.
How would that be ideal?
total freedom
no opression
no corrupt fat men
Because anarchy doesn't work is the whole reason we have governments. :P
12what do you put in that chili?
eeyup
habaneros
three of 'em.
12yeah
I'm not good with mslspeek, elaborate.
12you aren't playing around
12XD
i still believe that we should try to minimize those governments as much as possible, though
:3
12i'd love to try it
and it was delicious~
commands other than the default
12too bad it probably will never happen
well to me.
lol
the less power for the gobernment, the more power for the people
12i honestly
12don't know where i can buy habaneros around here
Well you can do it the easy way, or the hard way
02*WB03(Aurora03)02WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it

can you explain both? :p
I'm glad my local grocery carries 'em.
/me has a shiver go down his spine
haha nice
granted though
they don't always look the best
Fucking Rob Ford...
Which would be User commands, there's really no code on it, but it makes stuff easy, like /bot for me would make the bot speak, if I have access
but when they look decent that's when I buy them lol
Ah
Which would be somewhere in preferences I guess...
...why am i ranting about politics, now again?
Dunno. XD
Something about emotions?
well
that was a fun TF2 game
to all who were there
well, how do you make them? :P
o rite, polarfire
I totally wasn't
12It probably was :<
:D
also, why are we watching whather stuff
Well you open up the User commands window, which is SOMEWHERE!
Right now, we need to get our crappy economy under control and stop greedy corporations from ruining the US.
12i wasn't
12Glad you had a fun time though :3
12i'm too busy downloading tf2 on another computer to play tf2
Somewhere in preferences, and you get a list, and a text box
WUT
SQUEEZE BACON?
12lol
WUT
03LOL what
WUUT
MELONS
ICE CREAM
CEREAL
12lol
WUT
IT'S REAL, YOU CAN BUY IT
WUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT
And stop corporate-backed bills like S.978 from even being conceived.
Squeeze bacon! It even makes real bacon better!
And then like, you click add, or whatever "+" button you see, and you type in the name, lets say "ram"
Push button. Receive bacon.
wait
what
So then you get a new command, /ram. You type stuff in the text box like...
I could really go for some bacon right now.
me rams the fuck out of &2.
me prances off.
And then you can...
/me rams the fuck out of Bed.
/me prances off.
MFW mIRC is so much easier.
12My computer was borking to badly to play tonigh
:P
12tonight*
User commands is simple stuff.
I can't see how it'd be hard, most of the trouble is finding it.
What now?
Settings -> Advanced -> User Commands
Yeah I forget, mine is just on a list called settings so it's different for me
Ah
MFW we stream longer than BMN.
I couldn't play because I was too busy not playing
thanks
f yeah¨
The hard way would be to take up perl, tcl, python... and Csomething
I know Python and C :p
what about we watch some cartoons?
I don't watch any other than MLP. XD
like, ducktales?
What do you have in mind?
Then you're a million steps ahead cause if you know them it's awesome
for nostalgia
heh
then I need to figure how to incorporate it into x-chat
My internet is dying a slow and painful death right now
http://xchat.org/docs/xchatpython.html
Myster solved.
03ew. x-chat.
adventure time is also awesome, for being so new
/me runs
/me nini
Why is the python one so much easier to read than the perl one
That's like, languagist.
12lol
:D
/me happily doesn't eat them
even I'm not that crazy XD;
I don't know if the same is true for others but whenever I loop I die.
12XD
12what are they?
12supposed to be like 100 times hotter than a habanero?
But once you figure out the whole Language -> XChat shit it's pretty cool.
the hottest naturally-occurring peppers on the planet.

12i know
I dunno the actual number
MFW I'm going to get those and put them into food.
...
Then give it to my friends.
:D
but it's higher than I really want to bother with lol
That doesn't look like a thumbs up at all
That looks way worse.
SO DISREGARD THAT THUMBS UP.
Although outside.
WHICH I ASSURE YOU IS A THUMBS UP.
Yeah.
So they don't throw up in my house.
rofl
12yeah and you can hide the body easier
12lol
much as I love spicy food
I draw a line between that tingly feeling you get when you eat something spicy
and just dowsing oneself in pure capsaicin
12i....
MFW this show.
one of those is nice.
I have never seen this show before.
The fuck?
12for some reason usually get the hiccups if i'm eating something too spicy
This sounds frightening.
that prety much sums it up, yeah
I just feel intense pain
:(
12do you know capsaicin is used for pain relief?
12XD
12as odd as that sounds
that... sounds like a lie.
XD
heya PTS
YOU DING-DONG
12XD
Get a life!
and xchat actually is pretty good
12it's supposed to numb the receptors
12i guess after you died from the pain of ingesting it
and python is easier than perl imo
rofl
I'm guessing after you're dead
you'd be numb to a lot of things.
isn't ice less you know
lethal?
:(
This show is so smarmy. so saucy
They both seem similar to me, python looks like it can do more, or maybe it's just I suck at perl compared to what people have made
'
Cross my heart, and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
episode 5 is best. it has vikings
I've never done perl :p
His arms! They're all noodly!
python is awesome

O_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________o

12i never thought it'd hurt to have it on the skin
12did you rub your eyes with it?
Wait. Is the princess young Celestia?
no, thankfully XD
12XD
...
that woulda been even uglier.
/me is going to bed.
This show...Is just...Strange...
12much much uglier
but yeah, capsaicin does get absorbed into your skin
it just doesn't happen right away
I don't remember any of that crap in Adventure Time.
I think it took sixty to ninety minutes for me to feel it.
maybe two hours.
And then I wouldn't stop feeling it.
Strange?
the burn lasted like three days. @_x
Unless you're referring to rainicorns.
You haven't seen strange until you see the boom boom mountain episode
FOREVER
I've seen it.
I consider The Regular Show strange, not Adventure Time.
This is seriously frightening me.
12oww
...
12you know some people actually get injeceted with capsaicin
It's just strange.

I'd only do that if given ridiculous compensation.

not quite magical I'm afraid :(
maybe if I added yogurt it'd be magical.

92 died altogether apparently

you can have that if you want.

Meh, I'll just leave it running and come back later.
See if anyone stays the whole way through. XD
Lol, Lyon. I didn't realize you left.
04LOL Really?
Yeah, I was all looking for you. . -.
I'm not a fan of packed rooms, lol.
04XD
04I prefer it
Never liked it in any FPS game, really. It gets too chaotic. I prefer medium-sized rooms, like around 12 people, not 24. xD
I kept shooting random arrows and kept getting kills like that, haha.
04haha
04Don't arrows kill in one hit?
No, but they deal a good amount of damage. Around 120, I think.
And when everyone's running around shooting each other, their health is already low, so it pretty much is a one-hit kill at that point. xD
04Well
04Get a headshot and they're doomed.
Yeah, but that requires precision. I don't have that without a mouse, lol.
Lol Norway
Aiming with analog sticks is hard.
Rip people who died tho
It's also just fun to shoot random arrows and get kills. XD
good thing its over
04XD
04Well
04I've gotten a few headshots
04They really aren't worth the hassle because enemies move around too much.
04Just hit them twice in the body - Heavies are prime targets if you catch them unaware
06heavies I find easier to shoot twice in the face but that's just me :P
The scope in this game doesn't have much horizontal or vertical movement.
I just don't like how you have to stay zoomed to get a powerful shoot. I thought that was kinda dumb.
Give my my insta-kill headshots. xD
06and motivate more people to try to run around and quickscope in a game it doesn't work in?
06sounds like a plan :P
04XD
04I was playing CoD the other day with a friend.
So down.
04Sniping is so difficult in that game
06LOL what
I'm guilty of doing that when I first tried TF2. XD
Try Unreal Tournament.
06What CoD game is this?
Sniping's a female dog.
06you're talking about @Drake.
04Black Ops
04Exactly
04I also hate ACOG scopes. They don't even ZOOM
04But using the Crossbow is really fun
OH FUCK
Crossbows are always fun. lol
06^
you didn't-

06crossbows and bows are always relevant
04*thunk* what was tha- *BOOM*

HL2's crossbow. Man, best thing on the planet. XD
you troll
06every time you made someone stick to the wall with that thing you could add one point to your win-counter
you're really going to be up 13 more hours ain't you
It's also fun bouncing the shots off the ground to send the enemies flying up.
And with those ragdoll effects. lol
Yep.

how long can a youtube video be?
06spazzy
Dunno, I've seen a 24 hour one before.
i mean
I kinda wish TF2 didn't have gore.
there's a filesize limit
I need to see more bodies flying from explosions.
(hence why this video has so crappy quality)
04I wish the Soldier's rocket had a larger launch force
I dunno, can't remember.
but what if you make a 1x1 big video
one black pixel
The video size restriction is different for different people though.
that never changes
Well it's 5am I better sleep
xD

I dunno about Java though

Demoman is my lag character. Which pretty much makes it my most used. XD

04Halo has slight blood splatter
04CoD has nothing, I believe
04TF2...well...
TF2 is over the top, man.
06WaW had it, and BO has it in single player (and zombies of course)
lmfao
06yeah, TF2 they go pop like a balloon
04Well, that's what would happen if you got hit point-blank by a rocket launcher
06there's a difference between dismemberment and literally popping like a balloon
06But it fits, TF2 is all crazy and cartoony afterall
I dunno.

not really "fan"fiction

it's 23 chapters, but some chapters are 15000+ words
rofl damn XD
This chapter's only some 2300 words and that alone took me like a week to do lol
yeah, but I take like months to update sometimes :x
ask Drake about it
or Xeli
lol
my story kinda isn't a fanfic either
042300
04lol
but it's based on D&D so that might count
lol
04I remember when I was proud for writing 2300 words in a chapter
^
WELL SORRY I'M NOT A PRO NOVELIST :( :(
04Now I write at least 4000 words.
04LOL
lmfao
I write at least 5000
maybe I should make that my goal for chapter 1 then.
lol
04Nah
04Unless it's an extremely long prologue keep it brief.
06and I really have to just try to get some sleep even though I won't be able to x.x

K SO I'M NOT DONE LOL
the first paragraph
sentances are a bit long
fixing that too.
I think I just in general have problems with putting conjunctions and semicolons everywhere lol
I could probably arrange the whole chapter into one sentence.
o_O?
"It could easily have been starvation or thirst, but the arcanists of Skadi had suspicions of far more sinister forces at work in the desert."
switch easily and have
k
"They told of the dust-colored sands themselves springing to life and rising to the heavens, swallowing the world around them into void."
last bit there is dodgy
just doesn't make any sense
as in the "void" bit
hm
I'm figuring that you mean something like it's disappearing and such
but people won't want to sit there for 10 seconds trying to figure out what you mean
fair enough lol
"Any sane man would have none the faintest idea what such bizarre tales could signify."
04'would not have' would sound better
it's a phrase thingy or whatever those were called, sayings, whatever, but yeah
what Drake said
I think I'll just put "no sane man would have"
"At least, it was sure to not be the [i]only[/i] force."
reword that
and I also swear you switch from past tense to present tense
which is just about one of the worst things that can be done in a story
lol :(
04I prefer to keep in present tense
I prefer to stay in past
and Drake you write in past tense
lol
04This writing is like, 10x better than my first FF
04wait
04yeah
04past
/me headbashes

04I'M NOT USED TO WRITING TERMINOLOGY OK?
"When confronted by the city guard, one of them would simply answer that they were travelers or sightseers. "
travellers
04I'd show you my first FF, but TST is down atm so I can't
oh lol
TMoaTB?
04Yeah
04I mean
"He spoke little of the reason to his servants and guardsmen, but ordered that any similar characters be denied entrance into Skadi."
oh lol
I use 'guardsmen' all over the place :(
04I always have difficulty naming my towns and cities, so I resort to using Google Translate to get cool-sounding names.
I kind of have a cheat sheet for naming places lol
04I mean
04'Sacer'
04Does that sound like a town to you? A major medieval city?
sounds like a Latin verb
infinitive
or 'races' backwards
/me shot
...wait nvm, vowels are backwards
lolol
04It's Latin for 'doomed' actually
ah lol
04But then Google Translate isn't always accurate
sounds like a very happy city.
04As you could tell, the town is 'doomed' XD
"...the dust-colored sands themselves springing to life and rising to the heavens, and the whole world around them being swallowed into void."
04http://pastebin.com/7EZPSUKv
does that one make more sense?
04'and the whole world around them being swallowed into a void' would sound better methinks
maybe, I guess it does make more grammatical sense lol

04Hey, I know it's blatant copying but I didn't choose it
 ▲

only problem I have with it is mentioning all those nations' names at once like that lol
04XD
04Everyone who will read it will understand them.
04But I might trim it down.
yeah :(
hearing all those names and not knowing their relationships with each other is kinda confusing
■ ■

04It's just nations that border the other two
04some guys got pissed and are now stabbing each other
NEWFOALS CAN'T QUADFORCE
lol
ain't that always how war works
04I know
04But the reason behind the war isn't the main plot in the story
04It'
04It's more what the hell the character is doing there and what he does to screw with everyone.
@☺meter ◘
6 ◘ is 73% ☺. (534)
04Because in all honesty, he doesn't belong on that world at all. He'd an in-universe foreign object.
interesting.
<Drake> 'and the whole world around them being swallowed into a void' would sound better methinks
Drake
bloody hivemind
04As always it's explained in the story (or is it?) and everything is wrapped up
04lol
04late much?
lol
and I know
setting up a server :p
yeh?
you should read TCTL or Reminiscence :p
o-o
ohai
guess so lol
what's TCTL? Something else you wrote?
To Cross The Line
04Reminiscence is better
04IMO
._.
TCTL is better written
the beginning of reminiscence...urgh
and TCTL is better planned
I'll read bits of both.
And maybe some RA Salvatore because he's a certified badass.

04Ok

you can continue to call me Sato for short
eeyuo

10Otaku? :P
it's my otaku name
it's a challenge¨
Otaku (おたく / オタク?) is a Japanese term used to refer to people with obsessive interests, particularly anime, manga, or video games.
10I know
...dari has been very inactive though... i wonder if he took a nap?
EW :<
which i realize i meet all the requirements of and i'm now very proud to embrace that i'm an otaku
Nah.
I was watching F1.
i used to refer to myself simply as a gamer but that never did feel quite right
when did you go up yesterday?
When'd I start streaming?
Is that what you're asking?
no, how long you've been awake
Oh.
I was up at 2 pm.
so how have my retro friends been

how long has this been going on
12Hey Skylands
I think Arti's doing something
But yeah
This is overdue
10Hi GL
I saw tvtropes go down for the first time ever a few nights ago
10It's been down for about a week
It really surprised me
12She’s been upgrading the site to SMF 2.0
and ah
isn't there already a beta for 3.0 though
12Not that I heard of
a beta usually means a final release isn't far behind
12All I know is 2.0 just had its beta a few weeks ago
hmm i see then 3.0 right away wouldn't make sense
though tell that to google they've always got a chrome build in beta
12True
firefox is getting pretty bad as well
Fail :P
Chrome will get up to 16 before the end of the year
12But yeah, it's going to be down for a long time I think before Arti can open the site again.
122.0 is a bit complicated :/
Chrome 16 i mean*
I bet
Yeah :P
Firefox is just copying off of Chrome now
Not a surprise
you mean with their aurora channel
And GUI/Release cycles
12Anyways, bbl
alright later night
Seeyas
damn firefox will hit 7 before year end
these builds aren't anything too special either
kinda lackluster if you ask me
I think FF is lackluster in general now
:P
i was actually impressed by IE9
key word being was
Same here
I use IE9 and Chrome
Should check out IE10
Lol
that's only a platform preview
part of being an Otaku is staying on top of tech news

12 Hello, Destructor236 and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

it's kinda a catch up release if you will
No idea
i'm sorry i won't bore you with tech talk
They took so long to release Firefox 4
And then, suddenly
I dislike iOSwhatever :P
Firefox 7
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlGpiZ1Mcfw
Soon
Apple sucks
:P
Firefox 100.
Then
EVEN MORE BUGS

And in a year
Firefox 365
Well, at least Chrome has been using the same cycle for a while
3 years
Firefox 1000
i would rather them take longer between releases
and bring bigger change to the table
is that so much to ask for
At least the stable versions of IE/Chrome are improvements from the previous versions xD
i just want a kinect enabled IE 10
Expect Windows 8 to do that
XD
yea i know
WHich...is kinda bad
I don't like Windows 8 so far
I want Gmail with that motion thingy they showed on April's Fool this year
apparently everything do able with touch on the new start screen can be done with Kinect
Well, GUI based
Apparently some Kinect hackers actually made it real
Yeah, Kinect is a touch screen in the air
Which was awesome
Google should totally make it real
did you not like the start screen ?
And then anyone with Kinects will be able to use Gmail Motion
I disliked the lack of a desktop from what I've seen
Or the Metro interface
ah
Metro is visually pleasing
The world should be moving to flat squares and icons now
well Windows 8 looks to be a tablet styled OS for the pc
So, not if you're not able to use it
Much better than Aero or Aqua
Windows 8 is windows phone 7 for pc
I dislike tablets in general
:P
So that is why I like Aero/Aqua
Ew
/me eats and breaks iFail
They are so heavy
my build doesn't have the new start screen
and useless
Visually
it's 8 but not quite
I have 7989
I couldn't care less about Visuals :P
I think computer user interfaces usually should not need to emulate something physical
Windows 8 Build 7989
As long as there aren't GIANT icons everywhere, I'm fine
Oh nice
Where did you get that from?
Simple, unobstrusive and minimalist ideagram icons
http://www.winrumors.com/windows-8-milestone-3-build-7989-leaks/
i'll even show a screen shot of my screen to prove it hold on
Are there any 32 bit versions ready? :P
lol32bit
only reason my os is 32bit is that the 64bit download link was broken that day.
Who still uses 32-bit on modern systems?
Everyone's on 64-bit nowadays.
If their computer is new, it's 64-bit
Windows 9 will be 64 bit only
Windows 8 will be the final Microsoft OS with the 32 bit option
Is that true?
so i'm guessing Windows 9 will also be the first 128 bit windows
IF that is the case
Nah, doubt so
I'm going to stick to Windows 7
FOREVER
:p
I don't think 128-bit will emerge until 2020 at least
so as you can see in the pic i really do have 8
...
think about an average windows lifespan
/me smacks Satotaku with a red Swingline stapler
lol128bit
How long IS this vid?
Windows 8 can easily last 9 years
128bit is never going to hapepn
*happen
Windows 8 in 2012
Satotaku: I'll be looking forward to see that happen.
Windows 9 in 2015 I think
Then Windows 10 in 2018
Windows 11 in 2021
Windows 9 is the final windows
Lies
:o
If they are gunning for three-year cycles this should be it
next is Midori
Windows 11 could be where 128-bit might arrive
Midori is built to be the sucessor to the windows os series
I don't think I'd bother speculating about Windows
I honestly don't care until Win8 is -out-.
considering 9 will be the final windows you're right
then I won't care until win9 is.
i'm honestly surprised they didn't call Windows 8 Midori
Satotaku: I was more meaning.. 'Microsoft OSes in general'
no matter what you call them.
it's different enough from Windows 7
and Windows in general
though worth noting
why do they need to make the OS so different every freaking time?
Windows 8 is still a codename
so Midori could still be the final name
Midori is the codename
I think the technology in Midori will emerge in 2015 or later
Which is when Windows 9 and 10 could come in
I really think "Windows 8" is Midori
it doesn't have any more windows
it's all tile based now
tiles?
oo
Midori is about the underlying technology
not the visual UI
http://news.softpedia.com/newsImage/Windows-Start-Screen-in-Widows-8-2.png/
I mean the tech behind "Windows 8"
You could have Midori running on an OS with a UI that is identical to Windows 95. Or something.
plus Midori is a nice refreshing change from Windows
in name alone
it's something different
it's sounds like something mysterious
oh, those tiles.
that's the whole OS Staeld
i think the "Windows 8" i'm running is the compatibilty desktop that was shown
yup, guess so.
when you said tiles, you got me thinking about tiling window managers.
i really like the new UI
and the idea that it will run across phones,tablets and of course computers
o-o
quick question though, does Microsoft get money from people that use bootcamp on their macs
10o.o
Yes
Funny how it works
so they still have to buy the install media ?
bootcamp just allows it to be installed ?
10!espeon !umbreon
/me now belongs to Skylands for 6 minutes
/me now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
Media based I think
o.o
yup.
I hope there isn't a bootcamp for "Windows 8"
03o.
03:3
bootcamp is just the bootmanager and stuff.
10:3
03o.o
03*
In other words, it just partitions the drive ;p
Yeah
nah
though it will be fun to see iPad 2 running "Windows 8"
Nah
Not worth it
:P
my bad iPad 4*
bootmanagers are essential to boot anything.
by the time "8" hits iPad will be at 4 or 5
3 is supposed to be revealed in the fall
Sadly, the iPad will be as worthless as before :p
even powered by "8" ?
Never will happen
Actually i'm hoping for cheap "8" tablets
I'm just hoping for cheap tablets in general ;)
if Microsoft makes a cheap "8" tablet apple is screwed
Or no tablets at all
;P
Isn't apple screwed already?
"8" can do everything you iPad idiots can do... plus oh right flash
i don't mean you guys in general
i meant as an example
Well, eventually they well
Nah
iPad idiots are everywhere
:)
"8" will bring about cheap tablets i just know it
Funny thing is, at least the Wii supported some type of flash
maybe we'll get minority report style syncing between an "8" pc and an "8" tablet
That'll be a great idea
"8" is a unified OS
Even better- Sync all the games and software between them
which is really smart of Microsoft
every game that runs on a pc will run on a tablet
or your phone
If there is enough space on the tablet that is :p
Phone, I doubt it
But maybe
"8" phones will be alot more powerful than the phones of today
Depends on how far everybody gets with the tec
If 8 phones ever come out
:P
one os at last this is very good
less compatibility barriers obviously
I wonder how well W8 will run old XP and 98/2000 based programs
Compatibility desktop
Yeah, but drivers
Some drivers didn't work on 7, or software

touch slates xD
We need 11in tabets for that :P
so what do you think
i have feeling they've only just scratched the surface
I'll only use it if it was on a tablet though :P
PCs, meh
That'll be hard to do with a mouse
they say it's very nice with a mouse
and keyboard
if you watched the vid
I did
But no audio :P
plus kinect integration
which they don't mention
maybe in a future video
i wonder how typing with kinect will work
Poke the air
no idea
All you need is a No-Glasses 3D tv and a kinect
Then profit :P
type in the air ?
as if each side of the keyboard were really there ?
Yeah
Poke the air and that'll type
could work

what's really exciting is you only pay for the parts of "8" you'll actually use
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkKcFKzorQ
[1,0You0,4Tube]: Kinect Treatment of Windows 7 | by evoluce1 | Length: | Views: 172 404
Wait, what?
you can buy "8" in pieces in theory
it could be as cheap as $20 or the full $200-400 for all the features
What happens if you are unable to pay?
you probably just buy features as you go
Or at least without access to internet to pay with them
then i imagine there will be full retail releases
with all the features already
it's a great idea in theory
because it can mean cheaper windows
if you don't need fax and printer support why should you have to pay for it
and you can always just add it later
or networking if you only need wireless that's all you should pay for
am i right ?
Yeah :P
thanks to kinect security will be quite advanced now
we can forgo the need for a password and instead be scanned and logged in
now that's very cool
very hard to hack a computer with that kind of system in place
What happens when your kinect breaks?

About the live action movie that is recent even.

Ashleigh Ball is Applejack and Rainbow's voice actor.

MFW Adventure Time is just downright creepy. :|
People watch this?

My grandparents have been to Canada - said everyone was really nice and polite there.
Weather report says 26C. Feels like 30 with the humidex.
hmm.
Why?
warmer than I thought it would be
but still nicer than down here

It was 35C with a humidex of 45ish last week.

/me runs
Back
02You left?
[14:33:46]	Dashite	Weather report says 26C. Feels like 30 with the humidex. <- I've never heard of the humidex. I'm 100% sure it's the same thing as "heat index" in the US.
Yes
Is "humidex" proprietary?
Like AccuWeather has "Real Feel"
It's slightly different.
Wiki says that humidex uses dew point rather than relative humidity.
Oh.
Not sure just what difference that makes though.
02Must have gotten mixed in with the name changes
Dunno. I'd have to know the formulas for heat index and humidex.
The formulas are on wiki.
Hi everybrony.
Both are quantifying a human sensation.
Hi.
Is it me or everytime i log in today the same vid always plays?
It's still the same video.

Hi guys what's going on in here?
Stuff.
After this thing is over,whe're gonna watch a few Atop the 4th Wall episodes.
What's that?
the fuck is this
@Maxaminus It's a comic review show,in which a Minnesotan called Lewis Lovhaug,a.k.a Linkara,reviews bad comics.
so, yay hour waits
It's funny too.
Woop
I'm down for that.
I got some cool pix though
There's also a MLP:FiM reference in one of the episodes.
http://i.imgur.com/WO2Ye.jpg
Also,there's a "Zombie goasts" joke in another episode.
Awesome o.O
yeah, but darn glare
Or just geeky
oh well x.x
I got like 4 pix of each
12hmm
12Kosoveon tail o3o
hiii
/me now belongs to Kosoveon for 6 minutes and has to fly Kosoveon around until then
why would you make that face
;.;
12i'm only humoring him
12D:
so what LOL
12you make fun of apple all the time
12so why can't i make fun of that face
because making a face is the worse possible action any human could make ever in all of eternity :P
yes
it is
And,when i said funny,i meant "I foung it funny but you might not".
*found
you know what I hate? false advertising.
I'm at the IMAX, right
"Apply today's admission towards a membership"
small print
"excludes IMAX"
then why would they put those postefs here
*r
>_<
What is this? Is this some kind of satire?
No clue.
This guy reminds me of salad fingers.
I fought Salad Fingers was green.
12o-o
12annoyed Kosoveon
He is. He's also a creepy, spastic man-child.
12i tried to wash the car floor mats
12and now they won't dry
did they get stained or something
12no
Dunno about the spastic part,but yes he IS creepy.
12i'm trying to clean the car to get it looking like brand new
damn you, internet!!
/me tried putting his through the washing machine after conventional means of cleaning wouldn't work
12not letting any detail go amiss
ahh
12however i did recently track mud onto one of the mats
12They won't dry? lol
mud is next to coffee
12yeah
as to the list of things that are impossible to get off of mats
12they were still dripping water
12D:
microwave them :>
/me shot
12lol
12it probably isn't helping i have them all laid on top of eachother
12but you'd think the very top one should be drying
When you expell a black, gooey mass out of your body, then chuck it in a baby carriage and dash over to your neighbors house and start smearing it all over the windows in an attempt to clean them....
..yeah..
WTF?
fricking wi-fi.
Laser sharks ate it
lol
12i've thought about using a hair dryer
Well,i never did watch Salad Fingers.
12but i'd probably need 1.21 JIGAWATTS to power it for that long
Lolwut
Back to the hairdresser?
12o-o
12I used to just let them sit out in the sun
12And lol, once I did use a hair dryer xD It does work a little bit.
12But really, nothing can stay wet forever
after over 3000 miles of driving over the last three weeks
Today I saw the second most funny thing happen in a datacentre that is possible.
12Nick
12the oceans have stayed wet for awhile
12XD
I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the turning fork does a raw-blink on Hara-kiri rock.

WHAT THE GODDAMN HELL IS THIS?
wow, is this shit still going?
YOU!
YOU DID THIS!
no
i just posted it as a joke
Oh.
You should be glad I didn't pick the 24 hour long one.
Damn.
i think that's teh limit
But how long IS this shitty vid?
all videos over 24 hours I've uploaded have been failed
oh this one is just 13 hours
btw does anyone have Solatorobo for their DS?
So......it should be over soon!Right?
12NO
i think so
k
This does kinda look like the end of something.
after the saturday streaming
?
we watched quite a few random crap vids
Oh.
Like what?
and some adventure time
and then this
so i guess it started a few hours after the show ended
FINNALLY!THE END!
Show started... 7GMT
why do you ask, nick
just out of curiosity
oh, looki
.......AT4W is gonna play now!
Because of me!
hey dari i think we're allowed to sleep now
12http://img2.smackjeeves.com/images/uploaded/comics/d/a/daf72c366PRx9.png
...or should we re-watch this while waiting for pony marathon?
I know what the game is
NONONONONONONONO
in fact I'm gonna pick it up when it gets released here in september
cos I had a couple of mags gave it a good score, said it was a really diverse adventure/rpg game, I looked into it further and it averages a very respectable 80-90% score average and it just got my interest, I'm interested oin getting it
wait its not out where you are Kosovo?
NEVER!NEVER EVER REPLAY THAT VID!
California
its not out in the states yet?
xseed announced it's bringing it here september 27
nope
02Nope
02States are late on everything :D
Was dari streaming A Pig's Tale?
o-o
europe got it just a few weeks ago right?
I'm not watching stream.
well thats quite surprising, oh well just to let you know then it got good scores xD
lemme find a review for yews
yep, I heard
No.He was streaming a shitty 13-hour long vid that Bjornfot posted.
03dfg
heard it has good characters and nice variety in quests
10hijk
but is very easy
which I don't mind anyway
13-hour?
eeyup
never played the prequel to it (Tail Concerto) though
http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png
>mfw dari is napping
http://myfacewhen.com/images/71.png
yeah ease and repitivity of combat were its drawbacks
he IS?!!!!!
yeah
It's all wrinkly and has a funny smile.
but yeah there's a lot on offer like minigames that are totally different from the normal quest (there's actually a racing mode all on its own which has its own dedicated online play, a review said the race game could've been its own game)
Bjornfot needs plastic surgery.
It's trollface.
No shit.
http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/28447/reviews/solatorobo-red-the-hunter-review/
I was being literal.
Oh.
both dari an i should totally have gone to sleep even before that vid
now i've been up like...
gotta say, it's supremely polished
especially for a ds game
since it was in development for a long time
it's kind of a miracle it got made in the first place, let alone released outside of japan
I'm gonna post another vid,this time a vid by Spoony.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fLP0F8N4fw&feature=channel_video_title
Here it is.
fucking long
~38 hours
yeah I read about its background and being the spirtual sequel to tail concerto

12o-o
Trollface pyramid?
I remember seeing screens of tail concerto in gamepro magazine a decade ago, gamepro, one of the best videogame mags I ever read and for some reason I was able to get where I lived despite being a US mag
I basically saw the entire playthrough of that game on youtube because it's too rare to find and too expensive for me to just get off of ebay, especially since it's so short
but it's a good game from what I can tell, with an interesting (although basic) story
Can you wake dari up?
anime scenes are nice too
and tbh solatrobo is the last new ds game that interests me
Another vid by Spoony is in the line-up now.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NLAcEOzfzc&feature=relmfu
but all the high profile titles have moved on to the 3DS, so it's sadly time for the ds to pass
God, he still comes here?
at least it can die gracefully with a few good games still under its sleeve after 7-8 years
/me only has an original DS.
eeeeenope
/me salutes the DS
without a doubt the best gaming moments have come from nintendo handhelds *hugs his 1989 Game Boy
that can't be more true
lol
in almost every instance I've prefered the nintendo handheld in any given generation to the nintendo home console of the same generation
and the ds is a perfect example...my favorite gaming system hands down
well in recent gens yeah, we had to last 3 gens of home consoles from nintendo before we finally got a new game boy console
true
forgot the game boy had a veeeery long run
I don't really have a favourite console, but it is either DS(i), Wii or PS2 xD
Nuke England. Wake up dari.
Gamecube <3
oh yes
Gamecube FTW :D
I have two...just for the heck of it
(Old and new model)
the little cube that could
<3
you could literally put it on a rope behind your car, drive around
and play afterwards :D
Yup
The biggest and strongest console ever
:P
also
Well
Not the bigget
who here tried Pokémon XD: GoD?
*biggest xD
WAKE THE HELL UP DARI!
/me sits impatiently
I have
I want to play it :<
and Skylands has :P
I have
It's a...decent gamr
*game
BORING at times z.z
one of the best games for the gamecube imo
and I own a TON of gamecube games
XD
SA2B was one of my Fav
And Wind Waker xD
I loved Colosseum or how the hell you spelt that
metroid prime, supers smash brothers melee, pikmin, paper mario 2
never got to try XD:GoD :<
Paper Mario FTW
paper mario 3d FTW
I loved that game
It was my FIRST GC game
Paper Mario: TYD~
Magnus Von Grapple xD
although paper mario 2 is truly better
Or however
I still prefer the original
dunno why
Paper Mario 1?
yeah
for the n64
I liked the second
Just because it is so...polished
Compared to the first xD
inb4 excuses
the first is very polished too
lol
or at least it seemed even more so since it came out at the end of the n64's life span
and the competition wasn't exactly great
XD
Sadly :P
But seriously,someone wake him up.
is paper mario 3d a remake of the n64 game? or is it a new game entirely
New
Thank goodness
because last time I checked on gamestop's website it's just a remake
lemme check again
...apparently not o.o
that's good
hopefully nintendo will get the remakes out of the way so they can focus on making new games and ips
brb

I don't know any songs about fish
but if I did I'd be singing them.
:d
thats why songstresses exist. :3
So long and thanks for all the fish.
that's a lot of fish
12the sun has smiled down upon me finally
12literally there is sunny spots all over the place so i can just lay the mats out in the sun and hopefully they'll dry faster
12That's good, lol
12and i found a way to dry them up even faster
12i ran over them with a rug shampooer
12which was killing two birds with one stone
12Ah, that's a good idea
12sucked the water out (for some reason the water soaked into those mats is still dirty water even though i had it soaking in clean water for an hour)
12and will make it dry faster
12It's all sunny now here as well XD
12XD
12probably even hotter there though
