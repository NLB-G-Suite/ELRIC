Egoraptor is amazing Inspector_Celestine :)
Thanks all :D

I still haven't bought Reach.

That boy just ain't right.
Nice time for buffering right?
/me agrees
/me feels Nittany_Tiger's pain.
Shit, that was fast.
360 users unite!
Oh, I'm not a 360 user.. I just borrowed my friend's 360 and bought XBL for 3 months. Still liked it though :)
There are too many Xbox fanboys that justify the fee.
Dat incognito
Welp, we're at the end it seems
I haven't touched my 360 in a long time.
Whoo!
finaly something pony related!
PC/PS3 here.
I play on all platforms except Wii.
I've got a PS3, haven't used it for a while though.
Wii is a platform?
yes >>
Yes.. I used to play CoD4 on it all the time.
Friend codes were bullshit IMO
I've been using mine as a leg warmer.
yes they were
ahahah, my favorites!
i only play to annoy little kids on CoD trying to quickscope
Welp, I'm out
awwwww
yeah
MFW I liked MW2 because of quickscoping.
mfw i like MW2 because of riot shielding
i still do with those TrollightSparkle
I like trains
Killstreaks ruin the balance.
yep
and i need some sleep
I don't like BC2.
Bye Dash!
Sleep well :3
thanks guys!
bye!
High difficulty curve. Insulting server messages.
I liked BC2. But then it got a bit boring.
/me is air conducting along to the music.
I had some fun, then followed by extreme frustration.
/me Climbs back on the celing
Is Ceiling|Dumori watching us now?
yep
good thing I'm not clopping!
x3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpYloHajJNs
Because it's balanced against poorly-skilled players.
I used to have more patience to get pretty good online.
I'd like a balanced FPS with vehicles, but we all know that isn't ever going to happen. >_>
Thank you though.
Closest thing we have is some version of Battlefield.
Best of all, no stats or unlocks.
I'm really hoping BF3 turns out alright. I haven't played BF2, but I plan to get it soon.
I hated BF2.
Similar to BC2.
awww, no more favorites from me XD

10 bucks for 1GBof Monthly 3G usage
dat moon face
for non-Blackberry phones
luckily they have eliminated throttling now that thet introduced "4G" (bullshit I know)
Hey.

DAMMMITITTTTTTTTTT
Bye! :D
we should probably look into making our own RTMP Server on Sathi's rig
Returns to business
and see just how much of a viewer load she can manage
MFW the curosr flies around and detail just splurges out everywhere
cursor*
I'm just wondering
*shit
wow
just....wow
her UL is about 20 Mbps, right?
I got one
34
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etyefd24yds&feature=player_embedded
Guys, I gotta go now.
Thanks.
GET IN DAT CANNON, BOYO
Oh.
Okay.
well let's say it's 20, and we stream at about .5 Mbps
/me noms blissfully on a marshmellow
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Only one way to find out.
Damn, I guess i need to be launched
yeah
BEE-YETCH

Awwwww
r.i.p. Season 1
Whatever, the moon is peaceful to sleep on i guess
Alright ill cope with my moon sleep. See you guys.
Bye!
later
we should also issue a formal apology for the 300~ish viewers we lost
we handled at the peak capacity just fine
It kind of was.
and it was great for 12 hours of nonstop streaming
nah Dari
I'm sure it was just owncast
weren't there potentially hundreds of other people lurking?
I desperately want this streamed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
^
/me hugs hero_spirit and swings him around
XD
DAT MOON FACE!
logical conclusion? Owncast servers are not very stable

lol, train

Was this any good? >_>
I'm angry about missing the beginning of the first movie
Okay
Yes, only because Zelda is the annoying sidekick
I missed more chances for heroic speeches
EVERY time, he finishes a quest, then everyone's like "kthxbai" and they leave him alone in a forest or some shit.
Alright :p

I can't believe how little people seem to leave the country in America.
The closest I've been out of the United States was going to Mexico
I want to leave, but it's darn expensive
Go to airport, fly somewhere.
Spend 2 weeks.
Fly back.
O_o
8just kidding >>
Drunk imagination vacations just don't work :P
The last time I went on vacation somewhere was like…4-5 years ago.
As far as I can remember.
8prince-dari oooohhh coool
Do you live in the US?
You. :P
Nah, England.
Just about everyone here leaves the country every year for a holiday.
8Miss the castles in the UK...
Relative compared to how far it is from the US to Europe
I've still been to the US. :P
8US... I like where I live thankfully... but that's because we have like 7 friggin national parks
Should I get on one of my costumes while we wait?
sure why not
>:3
Which one do you want?
I really hope to go somewhere in Europe when I graduate
Dari's seen them.
Oh, heheheh.
Yeah.
*sigh* Oh well, a pony can dream :P
8look around for tours
Yup
Thinking back about holidays.
Memories.
I don't wanna Tour, I want to go and visit places on my own
<3 Good times.
You pick one Dari.
That's the thing, I don't wanna be a 'tourist'. I want to actually try and blend in to the places I go.
That's because
>go to Stonehenge
>SOUVENIR! KASDOPFKASL:DFKAS :LDFAJSD:FLGSKD:G
:P
8... I'm pretty sure that's illegal
Americans go to France and ask for a bud light.
<_<
XD
LOL
My sister.
Yup! Barely! :D
I'd go to France and eat at the McDonalds first night there just to mess with people.
In St Lucia, asked the barman.
"Do you have any strongbow?"
"Strongbow?"
"I'll show you strongbow"
"Sniff this, don't drink it"
>she takes a sip
>throat burning for next 30 minutes
XD
8wow
That was hilarious.
Sluttershy, kinky_pie, I have many.
MFW she thought they'd have strongbow.
*goes to site*
"Are you over the age of 21?" >Yes >No
>_>
Ughh…uhhhh….uhhhhhhhhh
^_^
Well, since Dari won't pick.... which one do you want?
8prince-dari: wow Dari you talk a lot. >> Spam kick? XP
Also, story link yet XD
i think the best costume is nothing at all, honestly :P
Pfft.
inb4 Spam kick
You probably can't kick me.
:P
well, I say costumes but they are really just characters.
8that would be interesting wouldn't it?
INB4 we find out
but Sluttershy is cool.
amd i know :P
...and
not affiliated with the cpu/graphics company
Still here?
inb4 Invading Ponies
Damn
Heheh.
8o-o
Ayup
I'm good
I'm about to upload my fanfic, but i'm thinking of editing a few things
8that was...
8>>
8interesting
/me walks into the room. "Hmm, interesting..."
8GAH
8Shadowmane is evil!
Choosing between Derpy and Ditzy's name, for example
8I know he's evil!
wait....
Evil? My my, such a thing applied to me?
not sure of the proper terminology for that XD
fluffing?
8>>
How…how…how could you?
Hmm...
I mean, its a comedy, but not a particularily crazy/random one
Oh damn, I remember that now
/me tuts at the sad situation.
My first impression would be "This takes place on another planet or during a dream...
Lawl, Myst.
Old games are old.
anyway....
Yeah.
never heard of myst
Oh look, I brought a guest.
warhunterT71: Really?!
Yep.
8I mean. Um...
8B-Because I can... and... I don't like you... -squeaks- ><
With real people in it too at times, shot on chromakey
8I... I still don't like you... ><
:)
I never played it
/me actually visited Cyan Worlds
8I JUST NOTICED that there's a gingerale in this room <3
I think I played Myst 3.
D:
On Deviantart, can you just upload word documents?
Oh!
Hi!
/me 8hugs gingerale tightly
/me hugs back <3
zaco: Do u remember Myst Uru online?
Yeah
It was released by cyan
I sometimes poke on their once in awhile
about 2 months ago
inb4 Sluttershy
for free
Yeah I have the free version
Ahh.. xD
I like it too.
I never got around to end of ages
zaco: Don't play it...
It's laggy, and slow...
umm... Hi
and the puzzles suck!
I only want African Creme or Bailey's
End of Ages killed the series
Uru wasn't particularily good either even though I enjoyed it
Hah, my sister loves Baileys
One with FMV Scenes
but of course.
suddenly to complete 3D
Are you beginning to see why he has that name yet?
8pickles and milk... doesn't sit well in my stomach... e-e
zaco: None at all
That's pretty terrible
Not one second
*cough....*
Completely 3D Dudes, speaking
I like Olives
Plain pickles and milk, I can understand.. <.<
going that direction
Huh
/me scrapes the ground nervously
/me dreams of furries in the arctic.
and they did
I'm guilty of drinking the juice that remains in the Olive jar :3
but they're still kinda around, being saved at the last minute
XD
Well, not a lot of it
One that's more like Myst III
Okay : )
Yeah but it seems like its done at this point
they said myst 5 was the end
I don't actually know.
But I know it's not that.
:P
8>>
Yeah, but they've already broke that rule
by re-releasing Uru
well no they didn't, they didn't re-release uru
Gherkins aren't cucumbers. Pickles are.
well
I guess they did, sorta, rebranded as Myst Online
8gingerale knows all! <3
/me IS SMRT
Maybe in the US.
I really think they should start an open source project
Instead of them making it...
8My cat is a wimp...
people adding to it...
Nice!
hi.
Hello dearies! :D <3
hello.
aw thanks
*gives hug back to CrystalClear*
in a way saying "Do as you wish with this..."
/me 8blinks. "Huh?"
actually...
Don't worry about me! I'll be okay
i was just about to...
*hug for superbrony64*
and
*hugs for everypony*
8I have an announcement...
???
:O
/me takes a nap under Fluttershy`-Tree
Lol.
(pun intended)
Is that a pun or bad grammar?
I can't tell.
8both? )
No wait, this one. http://i.imgur.com/PIhVz.gif
I do
Well, my client automatically does it
But if I dug through it with some effort I could find something...
Well I guess I... I'll just leave then.
Yeah.
Colloquy
Mobile?
8so then I can kick you XP
I think I've been Spamming...
8oh u..
Stupid Deviantart title character limit...
(wonders, "would i?")
i
think
you
would
if
you
were
feeling
up
to
it
:D
hmmmmm
if i was paid a million dollars i would feel up to it...
probably
its a million... oh wait.
million bits!
soooooo
/me 8falls over (still as a tree)
oh no :O
Do you guys think that 'surreal friendship' is an acceptable substitute for 'friendship is surreal'? DA character limit...
*helps fluttershy up*
stream non-stop hamtaro till next episode
(well....)
its 3:10 am here...
i suppose i can say
i have a fever...
and the only prescription is more ponies.
hey actually.. during those random streams of shows.. was detective conan/case closed ever shown?
8mmm.......
cant say
Dari?
i used to watch it as a kid...
i've definitely seen that.. don't really remember it all that much
I've drawn Detective Conan fanart once. For a friend. She was making a story where poor Conan ended up posing as a girl.
just the lighting of the match or whatnot
wait how is "Friendship is surreal" too long?
Dari
you didn't fall asleep on me did you?
dari-beep, dari-beep, dari-beep
and 'chapter 1'
doesn't fit, stupid DA
errr
c1
Okay, I'm back
lol
If anyone wants to see the Conan drawing's here. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13406580/conan%20fanarty.png
or i could change the name
I'm guessin he did :(
it's not 100% yet
8ggrbbb....
But eh, it didn't turn out too bad at all.
No, the last chapter.
The name only allows 30 characters
fifteen minutes, no messages
maybe
yep
/me 8is sticking to yellow then
I forget...
I'm thinking of doing Part 1, maybe?
That could work
The first chapter of the second season.
even though it was aired all the time in the 90s...
The_Mole: Is that show still on the air?
I was hoping to use part 1 as the chapter name, buuuut
No, I'm still here.
I used to watch it all the time.
8does yellow stand out ok?
in reruns, yes
you see, since it mirrors the show, the first two chapter were going to be Ch1 part 1 and Ch2 part 2
i actually remember when it ended...
DARI <3
with a name inbetween, of course
We thought we's lost you.
But then i could rename chapter 2 and call them all parts
Lemme find out
<3 still here just about XD
then there was a reboot of the show in 1998, i think. didnt last long, fans dont seem to like it as much but i thought it was alright
Thanke!
well... time for fanfic then?
Actually, it looks unreadable
you missed Sluttershy completely <_<
it'll be stored for the annals, i'm sure
Hah.
It was a nice poster.
actually, i'll rename chapter one
Yes, read to us.
ok :3
leave chapter 2's name... hmmm...
*EHEM*
You mean the one that has all the Mane 6 with various foods and drinks?
8gingerale hehehehe
8yes Shadowmane =_+ trolololololo
/me rushes Shadowmane, her magic locking down his shadowjump abilities.
>fluttershy` start's using yellow text >gingerale's self-esteem shoots through the roof

8prince-dari: oohhh

Letti: Oh I see, lemme check
Yeah.
8....
8whoever posted vid to 'safety dace Discord' congrats. It is now stuck in my head.
Hmm.. Let's see..
Ohw ait no, noon!
Hello all.
hi
Yesterday I spotted a Kanaya and a Vriska cosplayer! <3
Wishing I had a camera D:
Oh poo... he got away again.
owell, I'll get him next time
not anymore..
well, since like half an hour ago
Damn, the entire 15 MB transcript is still loading.
oh yes.,... congrats on mod fluttershy...
lol
maybe...
yes
yes she did
I don't think I have the transcript actually :/
Really? Can you upload that anyway?
8gingerale: I am a mod for here )
But.. You don't have the powers. D:
Shouldn't you at least be half-opped?
8it's up to Dari to give me more power or not
because i have like three cats hanging around outside from time to time....
would you take a squirt gun and squirt the cats?
*guess
it comes to mind...
8yeah
hooray
/me 8lays down on ground. "Zzz...."
oh.... my
youre... not sawing longs are you
Colloquy, Y U GO AND FREEZE?!
Anyway
heh
been trolled vid...
Letti: I'll send you the transcript as long as it's okay with a Mod. I keep them for just personal reasons, but I don't want to give it out freely.
...
It's ok, I understand.
/me has returned, let the shipping COMMENCE
any room for shipping CrystalClear/ShadowMane?
*child innocence destroyed*
GGgala, that's already been done. literally. it's canon
hence why I exist... *cries*
8whahaha
yes
(because i have dibs on them all)
8yes...
Yeah. Uploading fic to DA like a boss.
But those are lost with time :(
Well now that i finaly get to sit and enjoy the ep I must say it was quite good.
The Return of Harmony Part 1?
Episode 201
I enjoyed it as a strong start for things to come in the show, but I felt it was very abrupt in the beginning.
i'm totally looking forward to when we have episode 1001 to brag about
Oh, never saw Star Trek (at least the newer one) :P
For reffrence http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M405eU4niYw&feature=related
exactly
android
but yes
"
:P
Here
Got it uploaded?
There, I've made reason with the universe.
I'm certainly not, warhunterT71
I don't believe I've asked you yet, warhunter - do you know of any particularly good non-romantic/smut fanfics featuring Rarity?
Do I win?
uh i guess.
still here?
@symmetry no
@Donraj yep. here it is http://warhuntert71.deviantart.com/art/Friendship-is-Surreal-Part-1-258958587
Next, i'm going to spend the next half hour figuring out FF.net
Let's all go watch the Time channel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4LSHvXE3TM&NR=1
why is this moskau song SOOOOOOOOO good?
And, I have the second chapter already written, do you think i should upload it now?
wait Moskau as in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQAKRw6mToA
yes that
lol, i don't know any fanfics that prominently feature rarity
there's Simply Rarity, which is wonderful
lol well the costumes are awesome but the music is extremely energetic
at least it is imo
Or "The Carousel Boutique Expansion Project" in the same vein
in soviet russia song sings you
Anyway, do you think I should upload chapter 2 of my fic immediately?
g'day from downunder
It's usually best to let writing sit for awhile
^ which one?
yeah...
THAT one
Donraj: in the horror vein, then?
damn
I do not like horrorfics or romance fics
Rarity being a sociopath, basically
not yet, warhunterT71, I'm in the middle of a few others
Not yet
but yours is in a tab
oh.. i kinda thought it was that one
kthanks
But the way the vocals are done is very...calming
kind like the Outlawstar and one peice ones posted today.
Very accurate :P
I never realy got in to One peice but it's still good.
It's damn good, especially now.
I remember watching One Piece
And now my downloads folder and my history are ALL pony
ITS ALIVE
Wut's alive?
lols.. also there's some REALLY chill and REALLY depressing hush now quiet now song.. i wanna find it again.. i might have already found it but it's not exactly how i remember it
But very ironic having guys singing it
I see this one making it in to luna's play list
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aznlBiIf9TQ
wow not many on now, from 20 hrs ago it was packed :P
…hoping I'm in the right for using the word 'ironic'
o...k
8I'm still here by the way. I still have um... kickhammer
No
kickhammer?
I dont think they do anime for movie nights.
That doesn't sound very threatening...
mm..and i spelt my name wrong..
aww.. but anime has some of the best movies:/
lol
Steamboy
Enough said.
Sumica:…Touché
steamboy.. i think i've heard of that
Haha, it's only two hours long :P
That was A quality
(╯°□°）╯彡┻━┻
Mainly because it is very depressing
^ lol
And stay down.
not the tables, i just fixed taht one.
alright checkin'
Plus the soundtrack for it is just pure bliss.
Yes you can
But I think it's available ad-free on Netflix if you are subscribed to that.
I really wanted that to be the A movie this week :/
i mean i think it bumped up to 72 now
not sure
http://ponyfictionarchive.net/viewstory.php?sid=103 how do I find all the sad fics
this is ridiculous
You're going to kick one out of the three people here right now?
nah the only place i would watch it is not in the greatest quality

Phonyjack: "Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 is a good game!"
8blegh I still have fun talking to you guys of course too
8I think there's only a couple mods even awake right now... >>
lol
Mods just keep order when there are dozens of users chatting at once to help make sure everyone has an equal and fair opportunity to share their opinions.
no, seriously
every fic I click on ff or pfa turns out to be extra sad

Well, I'll be going for now, but I'll be back someday.

>_<

MeteorVenture, Luna became Luna during her modship i do believe

Well, I think it's pretty cool.
It's like going to Disneyland and seeing all the characters in costumes.
the bit about her being a professional professional was sort of meant to be from Lyra's perspective
They actually talk like the character they are representing
i just feel that it's kind of unfair.. but i can't complain really.. it's just how it is

Well
I require a pony image to reply with, implying that she should watch ponies OuO
Not out of character since there is no established character
But still
Kinda strange for someone who's presumably a dedicated musician

something underground?
i left rather early myself
still the Dinkypage stream?
Actually, I was thinking of either Moskau by Rammstein or Moskva by Lyube.
The earliest thing I was able to see when I got back was, "Are we just going to leave Gall here?" followed by something about how you 'need more subtlety than I could handle'
even though it works quite often
I didn't. I went looking for a newspaper stand to find out about anything suspicious going on :P
To which they said, after noticing I had left while they were talking, "Oh, crap. Did Gall just go off on his own?"
Which I don't blame them for XD
Don't you know, you never split the party~
Cleric in the back, keep the fighters healed and hardy~

06,15Now to figure out how to put this in a script...
8ho ho ho I have an idea
/me 10can't help you, since he cba with 'proper' irc and just uses mibbit like a baws
can't be arsed is just another word for nothing left to lose
10:<
06,15No wait, that was "Freedom"
/me uses mibbit like a baws as well
06,15Can't use background colors in mibbit, though...

Hi RP
8 I think I want to try that... is it free?
yep
http://xchat.org/windows/
guess not
._.
A bit lagged here, modifying a Tcl script.
whatever
:O
06,15So... Lets see here...
/me is now in color.
hi
hello
06,15I still need breakfast, though... :P
Wait, robots don't have gender, do they?
06,15No, though I'm guessing you should call me a "he" anyway. :P
It's iffy
Objects tend to be female
People male
In english
The assumed gender is any person is male unless known other wise.
It is safe though
06,15How sexist of you :P
:D
10XD
English is a gendered language.
I assume people's genders online based on the character they've named themselves after (if applicable), unless otherwise specified :P
Not heavily but it still has grammatical gender
Blond and blonde
06,15So if French, but since they think vaginas are male, I tend to not listen to them...
06,15*so is
XD
Nice
Male female forms of the same word.
Yeah grammatical gender tends to lack "logic"
i believe that it's actually correct to use he and such as the default
I still do it and would even if female
oh, this is IRC?
ya i know lol.. i do too but i do change things up sometimes
Until English loses gender in that way I shall
irc.ponychat.net?
How did you manage yesterday?
06,15Well, I saw the premiere, but I missed a bit of S1 marathon
it only shows that you really don't know lol
I think arabic lacks gender past pure nouns.
Urdu might as well.
we could use "it" but that's just not right
Not 100%
Did you sleep during the S1 marathon?
With magic
When the episode 2 come?
^
06,15Nah, got called away in an emergency, kinda
06,15or well I had a 1 episode nap, before :P
i slept through it
Yeah I had to take nap too
...wow, it seems I've sparked a much larger discussion that I expected by complete accident (?)
Episode 2? Next Saturday Crossbow70
:D
Tknx
Lol
And confuse people.
They can cause issues when people you know disagree.
Hehe
Yup
06,15oh... lol sent the message to the wrong name `Fluttershy
I can't type that on here lack the input
start being* lol
I could make my name impissable to enter for most of you I think
Say where did that Magneto thing originated from?
They did a s1 marathon
It really was...
youtube*
Mods are alseep I think
post tardis
eh.. back to lurk mode
Back to trying to sleep
06,15My colors are very pretty, aren't they? :P
I support whites only!
Wait...
That came out wrong
Kick!
X3
06,15And no, mods aren't asleep, non-mods get auto-kicked when using colors.
Oh you mod now?
^
Or circumventing script? *slyface*
06,15Haha, no, the former.
/me 10flexes

/me is scared of ceiling beings
Like a Zelda mob
^ exactly
I'll dump you at the start of the dungeon one heart less
I have a mental image of my pegaus OC with spider legs now
Oh hia aprotrate music.
To the Moon from the Majora's Mask sound track
Both creepy and from Zelda
link must have lived in soviet russia.. cause.. moon fly to you
Moon banished to the earth
seriously zelda was such an awesome RPG
Ja
Majora's mask is one of my fav child hood games
Sooooo awesome
ocarina of time and majora's mask.. also a link to the past.. i don't think i played any others though
Played the GC ones they ok-good
But not as good as MM
i got majora's mask later but i still found it to be just as awesome as ocarina of time.. i was surprised cause i expected it to be worse as sequels usually are
I enjoyed the creepy as FUCK factor
oh heck ya
I mean wearing people's souls to turn it to them
That causes pain
To do
also getting all the masks was fun.. especially when someone already told you that you need a walkthrough to do it and you just accept it as a challenge
Lol
I did the do every thing in the 144 min challenge.
i'm not familiar with that challenge
You can play it endlessly
Well the challenge is to do ever side quest ect on the 144 mins you get
Running at 1/2 speed
how do you run at 1/2 speed?
One of the songs
You are told/hinted at
i didn't think you actually slowed down.. i must've forgot something
oh nm
Not quite you just get longer
Is impossible
Its impossible with just 72 mins
i bet you could do it with TAS or something
well aside from cutscenes
Lol
Speed hack plus slow ingame time
Lol
Sorry
that really sucks
also wtf whoever made majora's mask?
No idea now
I did most of my playing it years ago
oh i see.. i understand now
hi
:(
:*(
:'(
hi :D
hi
Hi all!
haha ye i oust kiding a litle bit :)
;)
completely
Bah
lols
_D
:D
have to go se ya
alright take care
And that's it
It's a bitch to do though
As if you slip up you have to start all over...
well of course
And you need to juggle time slot
ceiling|Dumori is meant to be my AFK name...
Why am I still active
it's stupidly slow but you got to work stupidly fast? that's something
cause i stood still and you came back
well ya i know
for all the time to be done
but if anyone can do it i can too lol
You need to warp around slot
A lot
well i'll plan that out myself
i don't want a walkthrough
Bah the quest log is good for that
Also you need to fit the bosses in.
ya i know
But deity mask = EASY as pie
You have to do the quests the cheap ways if you can
06,15Ahhh, finally some food. <3
06,15Talking speed runs?
a specific set amount of time
which is very fast apparently
majora's mask
no pun intended
All the side quests and the main quest. You have to use the reversed song of time (for parts at least)
06,15Ahhh, I've heard about that.
It's my ultimate goal withy next play though
06,15I don't have my N64 anymore, kinda regret getting rid of it.
I have it I think
my nes still works though
lol
kinda
The poor thing burnt out
06,15N64 just had unfortunately weak controllers.
Think we had a powersurge and it blow it
06,15Every single one of them got problems with the analog stick, it was getting annoying. :P
Yeah our n64 died 08-09
And it was used reguarly up till then
Those damn rare ware games
i never actually owned a snes.. i played it at my sisters house lol
=s
06,15I wish I had the Zelda collection for GC
Agreed
06,15I only have the OoT/Master's Quest disc
She's basically Haruhi Suzumiya. =s
This is just her reality.
I have the whole set
Was well worth keeping
quit bragging
:P
06,15Yeah, it wasn't released in stores here, though
i'm jk though
Pal got it with the GC at one point
06,15Eh, eventually I'll find one :P
Haruhi Suzumiya?
06,15but then I guess it was available in stores here, since I'm in PAL territory :P
And the 6 Zelda games one disc the reall selling point
X3
I had dia katana first ed cart printing
Sold it for a fuck tonne
i had to make a pun lol
:)
Such a collectable cart
For some reason
a cartridge or 2 of mine had a hole in it.. still worked lol
a sizeable hole at that
=s
Lol
06,15I didn't like Zelda 2
nah it was like snake rattle 'n roll or something
06,15Dammit, now I feel like playing Ocarina of Time :(
play snake rattle 'n roll and a winner can be you
06,15Time to get the GC out from the closet.
unless.. you're saying you don't want to be a winner
06,15I mean for me, to play some Zelda :P
this can't be!
i think i'd rather play snake waker
>.>..... >.>...... <.<......
06,15I'd play that.
Or The Legend of MetalGear
Not sure
Both are cool names
Occarina of libity
X3
06,15but yeah, going AFK a bit, I haven't played any Zelda in a long time...
actually
the legend of simulators: the horrible of seasons

/me hugs Silvermane!
07,1 D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw you missed me?

Bar saying if you can use an IRC client do it
14how are you? :3
14I'm fine
6Btw,how come it shows you as away even though you just spoke? I noticed it with DSD yesterday too..
Yeah
i think you mean a learning experience!
i was worried i wouldnt be anle to watch season 2 live
06,15I'm pretty sure it was.
07,1 yep
14o.O
14That's weird
6Yeah.
Yeah
Maybe that was only in the Fluttershy room...
6I can't put that I'm away o.o
06,15Yeah, it didn't take that long for it to get sorted out, and the repeat was very nice.
07,1 the fluttershy room was great :)
12<3 Oh yes. Fluttershy room was awesome
WAT
RP is Mod?
07,1 that's because he's a mod
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
...Even though we had to watch fluttershy's brain get hacked
6Anyways.. o.o
/me isn't a mod :(
atleast she was capable of actually not falling for discords trap
/me has to start thinking of sending another application in.
he had to cheat...
/me blames his gmail being retarded
(1st interview was a no)
12I'm not sure how I became a mod
12o-o
just did whatever he wanted anyway
Only found the reply yesterday.
12I'm like... the weirdest person... to be a mod
just had her pick between two loyalities
12><
My theory is they take the weird persons as mod. Why? I wasn't taken
no she was still loyal
just picked the other one
well, not weird per se, but more unusual individuals.
she didn't become disloyal technically
06,15>Dermathil not being weird
I meant unusual
12HOW IS MY TEXT? IS IT OKAY TO SEE?
/me nods
12DOES IT STAND OUT ETC?
Is BLU
is noticable...
/me squints his eyes to read.
12RobotPinkie: my name in highlight is hard to see on mibbit XP
Mibbit is meh
I use Colloquy for IRC
can't see text
because I'm on a mac =D
Lol
06,15Oh yeah, the light background
Colloquy is on my phone

Is needed fir modding. I guess
no it's not
they have the @
MantisToboggan, not in every client.
On mibbit with 599 plus
It is
I don't see the @ in Mibbit, for example.
07,1 nor a star
This is the first time I've heard of an @
12Luna: me and RP just have kick powers
07,1 that's cause this server does not allow hops

6Meh..I just came across a screenie I had uploaded some years ago,that's all :P
>implying they even try >:(
9WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?!
06,15Fluttershy` knows not of leverage, no. That's like... maybe the first night I was here?
14O: I see
06,15I think I missed most of it, though.
Leverage. A meme from Battlefield earth

I should draw a still from S2 again
too lazy to look for one
awww
10I can find you one
06,15It's good practice.
Would you?
10as long as it's from the first 6 minutes of the episode
http://blackmorass.deviantart.com/art/Breaking-News-258912740
xD it can be from the first 6 minutes
i never draw
except i drew a couple of ponies based on vectors
then i was like enough with cheating i'll try to draw "blind"
and it didn't look like a pony
I tried drawing ponies with no reference, but that didn't work out
probably
I can draw a pony from the side with no reference
but that's pretty much it
10the only stills I can really get are the CMC ones from the beginning. The rest is all covered with chocolate rain, and I can imagine that just being annoying
I don't plan on drawing everything
Just the pony maybe

<333
06,15I like these colors :P
06,15Haha, I did actually ask if I could keep normal text, but I was convinced not to. :P
The other mods would bully you
2,14 yes. Yes we would
10well the whole point of having colours is because when we need to say important things, we need to be heard
ok that is more ledgable now.
10lol*
Okay, just checking :p
then again, I can just set all colors in clientside to the same :P
10I definitely said something important this one time
just wondering if anyone is reading a fanfic right now?

Yes.
That math...
10no I haven't N_T

I could do
10?*
06,15Rainbow-Dash, completing the square is useful to see how the formula is derived.
Applejack(Twilight_Sparkle)^2 + Rarity(Twilight_Sparkle) + Fluttershy = 0.

Hello, Stomper, :)
when did Stomper get here
[22:37:24] Stomper has joined #ponychat
And I've wanted to move their at times because of our crappy piracy laws and such.
oh
oh I see it now
ok, :)
And ones to come.
oh hey it doenst get bold when you say my name :/
I gots a dediiii!
:DDd
At least they have arrested anyone in the US yet for PS3 modding.
ovh
Stomper: you're doin' it wrong
france
ovh is iffy
huh?
:3 Its only the biggest server company
/me puts on the foilhat before clicking that link
Yeah, I think that's they one they've been talking about recently.
It's about "lawful access"
What's this I hear about cardgames on pony-cycles?
I'm back.
Finnish ISPs have those blocklists installed
You can bypass them by using a non-ISP DNS
Ponyraku, the ISPs own the hardware for the interweb in the country and can throttle the interwebs here at anytime they want.
That sucks arse
I think it's the same here.
The two main ISPs have basically a biopoly.
Ive had servers at ovh and friends at ovh
its iffy
http://i.imgur.com/9bTVL.png
Then there's smaller ones with limited availability
Whats wrong with it?
Can't wait to see all of them being sued to shit
bad service
bad servers
yes they did
the law passed
Well :3 Ill comment on that when iv had mine for a while
They weren't limited to 300GB by law.
Why are they even doing it?
have you tried the kimsufi servers?
Are they running out of countrywide bandwidth?
$21/mo for 1TB HDD 2GB RAM, and a 2.44GHz proc
its not the best
but its great for the price
WUT
I wanted to start an ARM based budget server company
lol
10if trixie doesn't win
dari, could you get a link with those updates as well?
ohh
10this is a farce
k
do you know how to limit the disk quotas of certain users?
I am looking to do a dropbox kind of thing
dddddd
twilight best
that would be implated into the system
Lol corporate greed.
into the server?
i dont know that sorry
:/
The CRTC did side with Bell/Rogers, but they didn't mandate a cap!
oh
I guess the only way to escape it is to live in a socialist/communist govt. (maybe)
The fight earlier this year was about usage based billing.
Afaik, it's always been based on the speed you want in Finland
3g has been different
Yeah, good luck getting that in a socialist government.
One w/o corporate corruption.
But then you have govt. corruption.
Anarchy time!

Hey guys, did you hear about that satellite coming towards earth?
Eyup
ee-yup
How's that going?
Theres like a 6.5 ton satellite coming for the earth and we dont know where its gonna land
I heard.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=X-QDux8_w0k
Any day around Sep 24
thats kinda fast...
Well
At that speed
It's going to burn on re-entry
they considered that
but
DAAAANGER ZONE
FUCK YEAH
Idk,
This ones going too fasty
*fast
Errr
and they dont know where it's going to enter our atmosphere. not until 2 hours before it hits
You just need to calculate the angle, if its orbit is somewhat stable
Lots of flak. :p
Well thats a problem
5 (miles per second) = 18 000 mph
mach 1 = 761.207051 mph
Assuming you need to match the speed
You'd need to go over Mach 23
You dare disagree with me?
lol just kidding
I do. >:|
I challenge you.. to a duel!
No, she's done well.
ALRIGHT
Magic beats royalty I win.
Since the satellite is moving at Mach 24 and Dash is moving at Mach 1
You still have much to learn, dont worry *teleports trollight back to earth*
But...
Thank you very much.
Oh. well idk
If you don't need to match the speed, just intercept it
You could just missile it
:D
And we're assuming the satellite won't be slowed down by the friction caused by the athmosphere
Someone should do a comic or cartoon of Past Sins.

x3
720p mp4
1080p mkv
and 720 avi
:z
lol
why
would you have 3 copies
I have them in the form they are in from the /pony/ torrent.
Mostly 1080p .mkv
the 720 avi and colour fixed itunes rips

iTunes is a pos

iTunes is EPIC
lolno
(for all the wrong reasons)
also its EULA says I can't use it to make nukes
HOW?!
really
how
lol
also bioweapons
still HOW
that's probably apple's default EULA language tbh
That sucks... I always wanted to make one with iTunes
maybe Mac OS has it too
which makes more sense
not allowed to use Mac OS to help design weapons
yeah I'm temped to make a nuke with itunes in it
lol
missile playing pony tunes
as it goes
Fun fact: any EULA that is not in finnish is not legally binding contract in Finland
last thing anyone hears before it goes off is "WINTER WRAP UP"
kindo' the wrong order
/me moves to finland

I leanr basic japanese as 5
/me doesn't know squat about Japanese language.

06,15I can't understand it that well spoken, really, though it depends on the complexity.
I can't remember much of it though...
/me knows how to count to ten in japanese... barely
/me knows very, very little.
Knows how to ask a lass out in it curedly x3
I want to learn, partly for the language itself.
