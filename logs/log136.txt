Surprised that machine didn't rip off Scootaloo's tail
same here
dat flank
all kill them all...
Butt of coarse.
/me hopes the CmC help save the day in part 2
i hope luna does
lolno
/me agrees.
I want to see Luna in part 2.
isnt there no luna until later in the season
I want celestia and luna to save the day
Ponyville must be a nice place to live...
mfw i read mooponi sentence
They have snow there during the winter :(
They set up a cold front every Winter Wrap-Up.
i know faust confirmed more luna in season 2, so we will see her eventually =]
fun fact, only the video lags for me
Potentially unknowingly.
Yeah, she was
It lags for me as well.
not just for you
In stained-glass form :PPPPPPPPPPPPP
Oh good
I was getting paranoid here xD
im lagging ...
I'm getting under a frame per second.
that is terrible!
GGgala: You here?
Well, 1.5 FPS.
10 fps here
P sure he is
What is a stable connection? Nothing but miserable piles of packets!
If he's here, then why no response? :P
Iderno :/
wow, free Portal game is amazing. It should be more popular.
Someone's changing the vids
playlist
I'd whine about my video getting skipped, but with this MONDO lag, I don't give a damn
I think he's clopping
It explains everything
I could fix the lag.
But GGgala isn't responding.
<_<
>_>
everytime you clop, Celestia kills a pony....
05like she wasnt alreayd
/me is preparing to punch the lag directly. This should solve things.
XD
damn, I haven't clopped in like 4 days
/me already tried, didn't work
I've never clopped
05lies
OHAI
ive stopped clopping since midnight,
sorry, i was afk a little
I have never masturbated in my entire 28 years on this planet.
Uh oh
what happen
said the spider to the mouse
even then i done 1 month without
Yeah…let's not talk about that...
trying to kick the habit as it is just boring now
you don't need to clop? I'm jelly
05no not again
05argh
those shops are dangerous
This is a different one at least
What's this?
mute and now to pokemon battle themes we go"
an acid trip
oh snap, I'm missing my video
But essentially the same
I like this side show we got going
Solar beam
it's like watching powerpoint of a video, with sounds
I wonder how this movie plays with APC.
some of the time with soud
even thats funky here
weirdly that makles for an intresting comic
dawwwwwww
GGgala

mfw I first got into algebra
wut
XD
mfw that works
POL!
lol
SHENANIGANS
That was... interesting.
okay, hold on. trying to fix the lag and stuff
hi
Sol!
Solving an equation with 2 variables without defined variables.
awesome series go!
Sol Badguy?
...
anyone seen the pony version of awesome reach??
2 Variables = Need 2 Equations!
its call MLP friendship is awesome i think
damn, I ran out of anime videos of girls getting sucked into magic pandas
I lost stream.
Two variables are hard at first, but they're easy after some practive
05if read read a little
oh lovely, dawatch messages have doubled since I last checked
EMP! OUR STREAM IS DOWN!
05you will notice ggala said he was gona fix the lag
Wish we could play The Mentally Abridged series.
my maths is rusty
Yeah, GG is working on the lag
05so remain calm
05I SAID REMAIN CALM
sdkf;jhehuoivgfhouiafeds hoiujnsDAFPKOJINHLKJNAERG LKJB FSGDILHUSGHFND

/me panicks maddly
WHO WANTS TO LEARN LIMITS?!!??!?!
/me sets mode +panic on Diftraku
Calm people, calm ~Avatar
Limits are easy
/me aced all calculus classes.
Serenity now!
Hey guys, let's sing a song!
Let epsilon > 0
Calculus, I hate calculus...
With a passion
intergration is FUN
Derivate my arse!
:P
05Lim h -> 0
Limits are fine. The mathematical definition of a limit gets crazy.
Studying for calculas makes me want to derive myself off a cliff
^
even more fun with imaginary numbers
/me has mentally checked out now that we're talking about math.
THE LIMIT AS DELTA X APPROACHES ZERO EQUALS IS THE FUNCTION OF X PLUS DELTA X MINUS THE FUNCTION OF X ALL OVER DELTA X
I'm so punny
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRR
For all such epsilon, there exists an n-naught element of the naturals such that for all n >= n-naught, |x-n - L| < epsilon
hi
i makes mathematics EPIC
/me is in Real Analysis >.>
mfw we are now talking about maths....
I'm supposed to be an electrical engineer when I get out of school... I fail at the simple math we're doing right now
Integrals are fun.

Yeaaaah, not going to happen xD
The Reinmann Sum. :p
:P
THIS TOPIC IS ABOUT DIAMONDS
05it had to be done freeze, :3
SIN IS USED TO MEASURE THE Y VALUE OF THE UNIT CIRCLE
Yes, it did.
As does this
COSINE IS USED FOR THE X VALUES
/me is wondering if Wrek meant to say mudder, or misspelled muddle
y = rsin(theta)
http://i.imgur.com/6Muza.jpg
TANGENT IS SIN DIVIDED BY COSINE
05its late, i am entitled to typos
ooh ooh
Hyberbolic Trig every pony
Wrek, I'm 1 hour ahead of you...
so it was a typo...
Ew, Hyperbolic "trig"
Actually, I don't mind 'em
Those words are like hebrew to me
they're just handy exponentials, eeyup
I have no idea...
I had to work with hyperbolas for my thesis, and I didn't realize that sinh and cosh define the single branch of a hyperbola.
USE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION TO MULTIPLY OUT LARGE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
;_;
YOU USE THE PASCAL TRIANGLE TO CARRY OUT BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
MAKE it SOP
Strange Wilderness puzzles me. I kinda like it, but it's got a 00% on Rotten Tomatoes
Refresh the page http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
Stream's back up.
okay, trying a new veemi embed...
yeah, what he said
Bah the equastion is more fun for binomials
sinh x = (e^x - e^-x)/2, cosh x = (e^x + e^-x)/2
GGala, tried using livestream?
Eugh no.
Not livestream.
the backup is back up
relink?
haaaaaaaaaaa
ty
No, livestreem has viewer limits
x = cosh(t) and y = sinh(t) defines a single branch of a hyperbola.
You can apply to have them lifted
And viewer limits are ewww >:
You can remove viewer limits, but livestream is still "Eugh no"
Initially it's 50
hasn't done math for a year
Livestream is shit.
NOW LET'S TALK GRAMMAR KIDS
and acording to my exam papaers I can't do it
05when it comes to streamign copyrighted material atleast
This morning, I tried to view alternate streams for S2E1 when this one was failing, but most channels were full.
hyperbolic "trig" functions are called so because they differentiate and integrate similarly to true trig functions
Wrek: So for us it's useless.
:P
05precisley
:P
I did get one with crappy sound, but no lag.
*squee*
oddly enough the veemi stream worked best
I got one with no lag and good sound
Yep
but I jumped ship early
05im just happt with my 1080p copy of S2 ep1
05happy*
sin x = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/2 cos x = ((e^ix) + (e^-ix))/2
I had one thousand backups going
DL link for it or you record
Still no torrent on archive
Man, Nit
Somepony knows their Trig
05ripped the youtube vid
Yeah, exponentials are everywhere
mon visand quand le mathematique
Bo stream for me.
No*
Yay
Yep.
that was a fun day yesterday
Lol lag
Trig is quite beautiful IMHO
I might be off with those definition by a bit, though.
yay, no more lag
O
possabley
I can cheak
In continuous probabilities 1/e pops up surprisingly often, too.
j/k
That was my computer
No lag is good lag
I have my data book some place near
e is best number
i is also good
actually, it's lagging a bunch less now
pi is a bad number
ei is even better though
it works bettar
/me looks at his sea of desk detritus. This might take a while!
less lag just in time for pinkie
okay, so stream works great?
you're all at www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/ ?
this is catchy
more or less
It's the ratio of circumference to diameter, but you will never use diameter anywhere else.
-1 is best number
yeah, it does
If pi is bad, why does it have its own day?
yessir
*knocks table*
I know this one mostly by heart: e^(ix) = cos(x) - i*sin(x)
0 is best number!
sqrt(-1) is best
:P
Edward_Newgate: Because Aristotle loved it.
It's a horribly defined number
Can't explain that
tau = 2*pi is better.
Aristotle is the daddy of Psychology too
0¹
Aristotle was a beast
Since it's ratio of circumference to radius, which is something that's used much, much, much, much more often.
e^i*pi
is also best number
the name of this video?
*is?
e i and pi are my fav numbers for no reason

trollestia has a nemesis now
/me Some of you may have heard already, but NASA has discovered a satellite far in space, and based on its speed and direction, it is believed to collide with Earth around September 24 or later.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mPA6QPrqvI
woo!
sweet
......where?
LordCelestia: Okay?
atleast i have my 17th!
/me The possible area won't be able to be confirmed until 2 hours BEFORE it hits earth.
Sweeet
05link to source LordCelestia
December 21st?
I'LL JUST PUNCH IT IN THE FACE
Ill show you my proof
...this proves that Celestia IS a troll
Will it bring us to Ponyville?!
wait
Its a satellite
this is
@SuperBrony64 i hope so!
DANGEROUS
Not a magic comet
As in a meteor
:P
Or a tech satelite?
Is a satellite de-orbiting?
TELL MEE I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK
Calling the 2 hour thing bs
I'd better buy a baseball bat so I can FLCL that... wait satellite?
well
Besides, doesn't NASA, like ,not exist anymore
Tovlar, you win
LordCelestia: So what's the problem? Is it going to destroy the planet?
How do you discover a satellite?
NASA still exists.
/me is calling bullshit
A natural satelite or a manmade satelite?
It's just not doing much anymore.
05a hoofmade satellite
Oh
So its alien?
Then fuck that shit
the satalight is is real its an old one
05i dunno, LordCelestia havent provided a source yet
@Wrek my god... thats the worst type! WE ARE DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMED!

In the past 24 hours, I've had pizza, toast, and lots of coffee.
you ate coffee beans?
a day well spent =D
make some tea then hit the hay Dumori

nah I mean drunk
I ate a grilled cheese sandwich…that's a bout it
Drank
I've just got up ThePretender
about 3 hours ago
I still very much want Pizza :/
went to party, it was shit. but with possibiblity of turning cousin inot brony
I have plenty of leftover pizza
With rubies!
I hit the hay after the encor of e1

will follow through
but YOU CAN'T HAVE IT

You made this?
No..but it was my request!
THe size of that crater.....
...ah
So you could essentially say that :D
5 miles per second is n;t to fast for somthigning in orbit and falling
That velocity
It'll get faster
It weighs in at 6.5 tons
then slow

Dumori: Enough to cause a paper cut
when it enters atmo
i think it will most likely hit the ocean

Blue is my favourite.
B/W is my favorite because of Iris
which is why I had Soul SIlver for a year and no chance to play it bcause no DS
My least favorite is Firered
dari, I still have blue around
but B/W has good grunt theme music and thats all....
Same, but my battery in blue died.
my GB is shite...
B/W has awesome music in general
*Sniff* it doesn't boot it
B/W had an actual ending
Now two chickens!
my battery in Red, Yellow and og Silver died ;_;
My battery in Ruby died, but it still works
same for my Sapphire
300+ hours, woo
SCOOT
/me prefers pokemon emerald no matter what
don't you mean BAWK, Sol?
Fav starter from each region?
Yeah, but with the old games at any rate, your save dies if the battery goes.
Diamond Pearl was... ok I guess
/me plays pokemon as .rom from an SD card
Yarrrr
Bawk doesn't sound like TOOT though?
ROMs ftw
no dead battery there!
Bulbasaur, Cyndaquil, Torchic, Turtwig, Snivy
Oh, and snivy as well
snivy because i heard was worst starter and i wanted a challenge
Chacarron!
lol
Derpy knows the lyrics to this song
>mfw the philly steak I just got doesn't have any seasoning on the meat
nobody else does.
>mfw that doesn't overly matter, as I put sriracha sauce on it.
/me craves macarons
...true, but BAWK BAWK BAWK is more fitting, seeing as it's Scootloo
Actually, I don't use my starter in Black
My fire type is Mothra, my Grass type is Sawsbuck, and my water type is Seismitoad
starter was level 80 by the time i got to the elite 4
The starters in Black were horrendous
First time I'm listening to this song in full..
owned them all...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599xiSGk2NM
had some level 40s just incase
that's od
d
Snivy was the only good starter in B/W
Be warned, you should turn your volume down
all water starters, all the time
saafeeetty daanncee
EMERALD IS SUPERIOR
to everything
Infinite TMs, Cloyster can now learn Hydro Pump after 15 years.
haha, yeeees
Hydro Pump sucks
I wish they still had the Battle Frontier from Emerald...
Best one ever
I have a Galvantula that spams Thunder
>yfw Thunder gets to 91% accuracy
Team Magma/Aqua were the dumbest teams ever.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyQlryTt-0&feature=related
strongest pokemon + my favourite is Latios, has very high speed IMO
I once had a Lv100 Blaziken that spammed Overheat
91% for Thunder? WHAT MAGIC IS THIS
lol, I love Latios
I didn't know flooding the world would be bad!
Galvantula has Compound Eyes
Which boosts the accuracy of all its moves by 30% of their base
Finally, a playable Spider Pokemon
mother of god....
wow
It's Elec/Bug, too.
My vid!
/me snickers
Evil video is evil
Huh, that was weird
I know, I just felt like it
Elec/Bug is a good typing combo, too.
Pokespider knows Energy fall to mess with Ground Type (hidden power is better, but still)
If we're doing this video in the order presented in request channel, next video is HEADPHONE WARNING
Elec Bug reminds me of Battle Network 3
what i hate is electric types with levitate....
Energy Ball
NO WEAKNESS SRSLY?!?!?
There is one now
There was already Ghost/Dark that had no weakness
Wash Rotom is broken as hell.
Spiritomb?
Yup
what about rock attacks?
Nope
don't those supereffect?
Wash rotom is really OP
It's only weak against Grass and Super effect against everything.
Rock is super effective against Ice and Flying, that's it.
dang
and Fire
Right
I knew I was forgetting something.
stream and chat, not related.
Oh wait, guess not.
Nvm, one of them is a headphone warning though...
Porygon2 Became the shit again in B/W
uh-oh speaking of shit, brb
/me done the GTS glitch to get shiny porygon 2
got some good legends with them
ouch
my ears
BRIAN BLESSED singing So Many Wonders
Just realized this tab was still open from like 13 hours ago lol
This video is the headphone warning!
:3
So yeah…HEADPHONE WARNING
:P
Brian Blessed sings like an angel :3
so beautiful
should be on every talent show in the world
would win straight away
MFW my dad bought crumpets.
I could have tea and crumpets. Lawl.
>never done that before
brit stereotype?
Yes

i dont drink tea much and i dont eat crumpets
I freaking love crumpets
Ohai

I still haven't bought Reach.

Nice time for buffering right?
/me agrees
/me feels Nittany_Tiger's pain.
Shit, that was fast.
360 users unite!
Oh, I'm not a 360 user.. I just borrowed my friend's 360 and bought XBL for 3 months. Still liked it though :)
There are too many Xbox fanboys that justify the fee.
Dat incognito
im a 360 user....
Welp, we're at the end it seems
I haven't touched my 360 in a long time.
Whoo!
finaly something pony related!
PC/PS3 here.
I play on all platforms except Wii.
this is so well done
Do we know next weeks movies yet? o-o
I've got a PS3, haven't used it for a while though.
Wii is a platform?
yes >>
Lawl Tovler
I have a PS3 I haven't used since about August
Yes.. I used to play CoD4 on it all the time.
I'm slowly leaving the PC due to publisher bullshit (DRM).
Wii is dead...
Friend codes were bullshit IMO
I've been using mine as a leg warmer.
yes they were
only good thing about nintendo was ds because of pokemon
ahahah, my favorites!
"Oh look! Connect with your friends with this 16 character code that you won't remember!"
I really don't like gaming anymore. It's being monotinized to hell.
hooray for autoplay, now you all see what I listen to XD
I wish I could be a PC gamer.
i only play to annoy little kids on CoD trying to quickscope
Welp, I'm out
Aww, bye Sol!
And horrid copy protection on PC games.
dat Soul Calibur suite
awwwww
just use the most annoying stuff
yeah
bye, Sol!
See you guys on Friday!
MFW I liked MW2 because of quickscoping.
And greedy publishers like Activision.
It was the most you could have on that game. :|
I liked MW2 because I got to troll people with Marathon, Lightweight, Commando, and Tac Knife :P
mfw i like MW2 because of riot shielding
I don't like MW2's MP. It's a mess.
Sleep well Sol!
i still do with those TrollightSparkle
I like trains
Nittany_Tiger, I know.. one moment you hear "Harriers incoming", next thing you know "TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING".
MW2 zombie lobbies were pretty cool too.
Killstreaks ruin the balance.
yep
BFBC2 is better than CoD IMO
By the way, what song is this?
it's a Soul Calibur inpsired suite
anyways im off now as it is now 5:06am
and i need some sleep
I don't like BC2.
Bye Dash!
/me hugs DashWithRainbows g'night
Sleep well :3
I wish I knew what songs made up this suite
thanks guys!
bye!
later DashWithRainbows!
High difficulty curve. Insulting server messages.
I liked BC2. But then it got a bit boring.
I don't have the patience for that game anymore.
/me is air conducting along to the music.
May I ask everypony a question?
Then, it got better when I created a secondary account and spammed the Gustav on teammate's helicopters.
I had some fun, then followed by extreme frustration.
MrEvergreen, Sure.
/me Climbs back on the celing
Is Ceiling|Dumori watching us now?
Is there anypony here that's proficient/experienced with UnrealScript and Kismet Tree manipulation?
yep
good thing I'm not clopping!
I log thsi chat for lulz
so I can never leave due to OCD
x3
MrEvergreen, Sorry, I have no idea :/
Ceiling Dumori logs your chat
These modern multiplayer FPSs aren't balanced because players that have put more time into it get better weapons. Then you have killstreaks that reward skilled players with crap to kill more people.
more Ace COmbat music <3
People like me who aren't good at MP can't enjoy these games.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpYloHajJNs
Because it's balanced against poorly-skilled players.
I'm hit and miss with MP.. I can be amazing one day, and absolute crap the next.
I used to have more patience to get pretty good online.
I enjoyed my first MP romp into RTCW.
I'd like a balanced FPS with vehicles, but we all know that isn't ever going to happen. >_>
Thank you though.
Closest thing we have is some version of Battlefield.
Of course Evergreen.
I wasn't good at the start, but I got better and enjoyed my victories.
Best of all, no stats or unlocks.
I'm really hoping BF3 turns out alright. I haven't played BF2, but I plan to get it soon.
I hated BF2.
It put a sour taste in MP gaming that never left.
It was difficult to learn yet I got my ass kicked all of the time.
Similar to BC2.
awww, no more favorites from me XD
OH LOL
THIS
THIS VIDEO

Buffering: You are a sad, strange little man. And you have my pity.
What the fuck are smores?
dari: Are you serious?
What are smores? Nothing but a miserable pile of sweets!
Chocolate and marshmellow on graham crackers
This is blasphemy!
...
O_o
It's a chocolate marshmellow sandwich o_o
Peanut butter and jam, marshmellow, chocolate and crackers.

Yeah, pretty much. But it's sooo good :3
Milkshake + chips

Am I right, or am I right?

Lays Potato Chips and Vanilla ice cream :)
Milkshake and chips? >_>

I was making Smores but they spilled my soda all over my graham crackers. -.-
LOL Silvermane.
milkshake and chips? as in French fries?
/me brohoofs TrollightSparkle

The Northern Incident
OH SHIT!

WAT THE FUCK
/me has the weirdest boner
Ahaha
FUCKING RUN MAN, RUN!
I'm not on the stream
That's totally the moving-through-bush / picking-herbal-ingredients sounds from Elder Scrolls
But I fucking know this thing
lol i forgot this is relevant to Silvermane's interests
/me is a wolf fursona...
replace furries with the mane 6
GGgala... oh you
And I can tell what part you are on by the reactions :p
how do you forget that about Silvermane?
inb4 screamer
DAT NON-ENDING
Thanks for that warning.
FACT: All furries are from Canada, Russia, and Alaska
^pff
>.>
is there really a screamer?
FFF
eeyup
lol
Yes
sure why not?
did that awnser your question?
OK THAT ANDSwERED MY QUESTION
I lol-whut'd
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Where's the stream anyways?
the buffer messed up the screamer

Or cookie batter with chocolate chips in it? :3
(>^.^)>
You taking requests?
this a fanmade advert for the new zelda game?
cuz i've seen that art before
Song of TIme!
it's probably the same one.
dat shadin'
Yesh? No? Because I have a request for when this is done.
I think requests are being taken
In here or on #vinyl_scratch?
scratch
oops.
Hey guys
the question mark messed up the link :p
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
:0
Fry some brains.
whats up?
Stream that.
Skyward Sword needs to hurry up. I want to pawn my Wii
all i know is... is that this artist is a true genius
/me says hello everybody
hiii
I put up my very serious equest in #Vinyl_Scratch .
Haaaaaai, LC.
Everything I've ever made is inadequate ;_;
YES
I agree
request*
:D
Hey, do any of you like Call of Duty AND ponies?
perhaps
I demand an epic pony mural.
Haven't ever played much CoD
LordCelestia: Eeyup.
Call of Duty is hit and miss LordCelestia.
Well ive been working on a COD- MLP crossover type deal
Sounds interesting
stupid buffer ;~;
It's in progress but im basically swithing characters to be MLP ponies and weapons like I changed the grenade launcher to an apple launcher
Hiya NewDCD
Who's streaming anyways?
hey guys
ugh, that old goron and that baby. Majora's Mask was intimate.
idk. but look at that ^^^^
LordCelestia, Had a look at it, looks pretty good so far.
Thanks. Im trying to figure out stuff to throw in for each mission of MW2 and BLack Ops
/me rages at buffer
Rainbow Dash is gonna be Reznov :p
Who's the streamer? :0
Buffer: Lawl umad Natleyn?
also guys sorry for how bad the stream fucked up during the premiere
we're gonna look into our alternatives
Buffer: Yes ;-;
We still love you.
.....wait
yes?
/me hugs Natleyn, it'll be alright :)
the premier I watched was this morning?
oh boy, secret buffer fun
I ended up going to an empty Justintv stream.
It feels like it was two days ago
Oh, and LordCelestia does this mean we'll have mindfucking ponies to go along with that brutal action?
any advice, NewDCD?
You know "MASON, WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN?"
I'm on my phone IRC client
/me hugs TrollightSparkle back
so I'm not watchan the streaman
Man, episode had a huge cliffhanger unlike the Nightmare Moon one.
Android or iOS NewDCD?
No, more like "PINKIE PIE. FOR THE LAST TIME. WHERE... IS... THE NUMBERS STATION."
Blackberry
Hopefully switching to a Galaxy Ace soon
How many times! Trixie was at Rebirth Island. We had to kill Trixie!
Dari, you streaming? :0
Ah, Galaxy phones are really nice..
Nope.
second best zelda game I've played
GGgala
is
BBs suck balls
But this 8520 Curve was like the only affordable smartphone in this country
first is Wind Waker
aight.
Trixies gonna be steiner, and Rainbow is reznov, so itll go something like this
Can I get a video link to this? >_>
NewDCD, i did stream MLP G1 after you left successfully
I'm already declaring Skyward the best Zelda
been continuing since
that and data throttling in my country sucked donkey dick till recently
10 bucks for 1GBof Monthly 3G usage
dat moon face
for non-Blackberry phones
so yeah
Interrogator: "Pinkie Pie! WHERE... IS... THE NUMBERS SATTION!" pinkie: "how many times, Trixie was at Rebirth Island, we had to kill Trixie!" Interrogator: "We? Rainbow Dashnov?" Pinkie: "Rainbow finally got what she wanted... Revenge..."
luckily they have eliminated throttling now that thet introduced "4G" (bullshit I know)
Hero's Shade. sweet
Hey.
^Whaddaya think?
Fuck.
but it's really convenient because I can now get a 3.5G Phone, the Galaxy Ace, with an unlimited data plan for 10 bucks a month
what the...
Who can draw like this? O___o
plus the actual phone bill
I have to go everypony, it was nice talking to you all!
Alright
/me hugs TrollightSparkle goodnight
Night trollight!
also Dari
the resolution on this picture is absurd.
get in
Get in the cannon
Sleep well, and thanks for the smores! :3
nighto
/me gets in the cannon. Fire away sir.
/me launches TrollightSparkle to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
DAMMMITITTTTTTTTTT
Bye! :D
we should probably look into making our own RTMP Server on Sathi's rig
Returns to business
and see just how much of a viewer load she can manage
MFW the curosr flies around and detail just splurges out everywhere
cursor*
NewDCD: Sure.
thats cause the artist is a demigod or some stit
I'm just wondering
*shit
wow
Dari, this is why I want to be an artist
just....wow
her UL is about 20 Mbps, right?
I got one
34
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etyefd24yds&feature=player_embedded
Guys, I gotta go now.
Also, nevermind.
/me hugs LordCelestia goodnight
peace, LordCelestia
Thanks.
GET IN DAT CANNON, BOYO
No need to launch me, Imma fly away blissfully in the sunset.
Oh.
Okay.
well let's say it's 20, and we stream at about .5 Mbps
Wouldn't she only be able to stream to like to 40 viewers or so?
/me noms blissfully on a marshmellow
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
/me flies blissfully off into sunset until some magic force beyond his control stops him and sends him back down to earth
Not sure DCD.
Only one way to find out.
Damn, I guess i need to be launched
yeah
/me gets into cannon "guys, make sure you hit the FIRE BLISSFULLY button this time"
/me smacks the FIRE BLISSFULLY button
BEE-YETCH
that's our mission objective for the week
Actually, I wanted to be launched to BEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAH
try again
:D
Awwwww
Request ignored? :[
r.i.p. Season 1
I guess so
Whatever, the moon is peaceful to sleep on i guess
establishing our own streaming service and testing its capacity via a stress test
sounds like fun
Alright ill cope with my moon sleep. See you guys.
Bye!
later
we should also issue a formal apology for the 300~ish viewers we lost
and explain what occured in that situation
Too bad we couldn't perform an actual stress test.
I'd also like to ask Sumica to see if he could upgrade his internet, just in case
Tovler: that wasn't the problem
we handled at the peak capacity just fine
It kind of was.
and it was great for 12 hours of nonstop streaming
nah Dari
I'm sure it was just owncast
dem quality pictures of an episode released this morning
Yeah, and if the stress test had worked, we'd have known that.
Goddamn, bronies, goddamn.
remember what happened during my Z2 stream with barely 90 viewers?
weren't there potentially hundreds of other people lurking?
I desperately want this streamed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=fvwrel
^
SO MUCH
/me hugs hero_spirit and swings him around
XD
additionally it kept happening hours later, when we had viewers on the double digits
Nintendo at TSG had a better Zelda retrospective.
DAT MOON FACE!
logical conclusion? Owncast servers are not very stable
already had my few days of that stuck in my head
WIND WAKER <3 BEST ZELDA GAME
dat ww. <3
so yeah Dari
Either owncast picks the worst times for mainteinance, or they're just unstable as sin
Hates gonna hate sailin'
Windwaker was awesome
Do Celda haters still exist?
Poll: replay windwaker?
If I still had it
YES
Aight.
The last game Pig Ganon was in
I haven't played that in forever.
Fluttersy`? o-o
same
>>
<<
Fluttershy`
/me hugs Fluttershy`
What are you doing, silly? :3
/me hugs Fluttershy` gently
4 swords was too much fun
... maybe I should replay minish cap too
hi guys
>.>
I only remember playing Wind Waker
Furottashai as in 'drew our banner for the premiere' Flutts?
I have enough in my backlog not to replay games, but god, minish cap was awesome
Minish was nifty
i liek fried brains
and I played Twilight Princess
fun fact: never played Twilight Princess
lol, mfw He-Man
Twilight Princess is the only Zelda game I've ever played.
Midna left a hole in my heart
I'm currently replaying Twilight Princess
Iknoright Tovler?
I sold my wii for a 360 and new pc
... Midna. ;~;
Do it GG. Do it.
don't worry guys
NewDCD: Or in Lagann's case, Midnia
that mirror shattered and you knew you would never see her again.
Link probably breaks a hole into the Twili world with Spiral Power a few years afterwards
Do eet? ;~;
ah, good old Gurren Lagann today
you'll see it when your past catches up to my future :P
but who we should ALL feel bad for
I'm angry at myself for missing the ending of Lagann-hen
choo choo!
lol, train
is Link.
Was this any good? >_>
same-ish, Natleyn
I'm angry about missing the beginning of the first movie
People said general gameplay was better, but... eh.
Okay
Yes, only because Zelda is the annoying sidekick
I missed more chances for heroic speeches
EVERY time, he finishes a quest, then everyone's like "kthxbai" and they leave him alone in a forest or some shit.
Alright :p
annd then Polarfire's
ohhh dis one
Nintendo, y u no 25 years of Metroid?
agreed, Tovler
o yeah, because Metroid was ignored for like 10 year
s
until MP
oh Polarfire <3
25 years of losing all your upgrades
:D
XD
its sad :(
the gap between Super Metroid and Prime was like 9 years.
I LOVE YOU
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
What about the 10th anniversary of Pikmin?
/me sings along
the Wii needs more Pikmin love
yeah... but the good kind
Pikmin 2 is the best cube game.
HEEEYEEEHYEHHHEYEYHEYH
actually all cube games are the best cube game.
I SAY HEY.
lol
?
yeah.
hey... who thinks i should stream Marble Hornets?
HEEEYEEEEYEEEHYEEYEH

If we do, I'll let Silvermane have his lungs and hands back.
Oh right.

/me cries inside
well that one was actually truly a mistake! XD

CHOCOLATE RAIN
9DARI! SAVE ME! D:
They didn't even wait for episode 2. They hit the ground running.
heh, Razyn just randomly said my name apparently before leaving XD
/me goes to save Fluttershy`
Why would you want to be saved from chocolate rain?
Come on guys.
Chocolate. Rain.
Chocolate Reins
Also, somehow I find myself keep coming back to this place...
Heheh. <3
So then, Chocolate Rain is the discussion at hand I pressume?
9Chocolate rain ftw!
(eats cereal) It's just tape
green text? without NewDCD?
So…Fluttershy…best Pony…amiright?
fluttershy is best pony
9I'm not sure what color I should use. o-o
The school books say it can't be here again.. until 3 crusaders unleash it
I'm exactly the same as Fluttershy, I resent her.
I must have missed something, did Fluttershy` become a new mod?
9Yes
Or are you disguised as someone else? *narrows eyes*
i refreshed the page when the stream said to and both the stream and chat broke
9ask Dari?
9If you want extra confirmation
9>>
>_>
I'll take your word on it.
But if you kicked me from the chat yourself, then that would say everything :P
9Hehehe
(eats cereal) just jump in place.
9sparm
9spam*
9I dare you
Well, I double dare you :P
9but, but I can't kick you without a good reason ;____; usually
Okay then…umm…
CHEAP VIAGRA

TOOT!
TOOT!
TOOT!

Sounds legitimate...
9XP
Hoof Hearted?
I have to say, it was my first time being kicked from this chat, so I applaud you Fluttershy`
Random Bro Hoof = Revive Accept, Return
9SuperBrony64: Awwwwww
9I've only been kicked twice.
9Once because Dari sent me to the moon. >>
:<
Why didn't I think of this?
9Second because I got accidentally kicked during the insanity of last night.
You guys must be on World's Smartest Inventions 3 by now, right?
Accidentally…huh?
*narrows eyes*
9really XP
9there were way too many bronies in here last night

And they say we're running out of stuff to invent.
>3?
I don't think NewDCD would be happy with that...
I thought there was just 1 episode
You'll have to ask DCD if he's alright with it.

So slow to load ANYTHING on there.

Nah, had a cold.
I like Rarity and Fluttershy
Fluttershy

CTCB: huh

8NewDCD: Yes and I stole you green for a while ;___; I like teh green

OMH MY GOD

I liek mudkips, do you?
8NewDCD: I I... I'm sorry I stole your green... even if it was only for a bit... ._.
sooo guys
What should I read?
shake it, bake it, booty quake it, roll it around.
Thanks, :)
it's okay kiddo
(I was making an EVA joke)
also I'm glad BronyState staff is becoming less of a sausagefest as of late
8How come you are not in green anyhoo? o-o
8sausagefest?
8that doesn't sound good
mobile client. No color support for my input.
np
8ooohhh
Brotip: Sausagefest refers to a part of the male anatomy
8.............eeewwww ><
ergo it means "we're almost all guys here"
8ewwwww
8>>
I'm just glad that is changing
I don't like the Smurfette Principle
Well, we don't know if EVERYONE here is a guy...
Dari?
G?
Anyone?
I meant in Staff, Six-Four
I have no idea.
INB4 clopfic
we were basically a bunch of guys and Sathi/Luna till a few weeks ago
you don't want to know what depravity ChanPerv would suggest.
>_O
Go get me something to eat!
so yeah
8Violet is a girl :<
>until a few weeks ago
>Violet is also new
8she is?
8I wouldn't know. >>; I've only been a part of brony state for a little over two weeks
BTW, are you going to stream new episodes of MLP as they air?
eeyup
Fantastic.
Six-Four, just like today yeah
Sumica is the main streamer for that.
Another excuse not to get cable :D
8le cabel is boring
Can I read you guys something that's actually sexy instead of just stupid?
anyways, everypony. I'll be stopping this stream after World's Smartest Inventions 3: Camel Toe Edition.
In fact it's already over for me, but because of lag you're probably still watching it.
kitty in a Twilight Sparkle wig
There's a stream still going on?!
>_<
:3
YfW/
8http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/
at http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup/ i believe
ninja'd
Stream just went offline.
8Oh dear I just noticed
Awww…
And I wanted to learn about the history of Camel Toe...
damn, there were like 3 more left
a non-hilarious clopfic? imokaywiththis
i might have a candidate
yeah, a non-hilarious one
:3
>MFW Veemi's lag didn't cache the stream for me like it did for dari before >_<
what was the name of that treadmill thingy
Why, you want to buy one? :P
i got a grimdark one
I'll buy 8 of them!
maybe
I'd look like a boss on that thing
8you and your sexy voice~
D:
maybe not grimdark... just sexy :3
and i also have a non-grimdark one!
:D
one that stars the best pony
oh my dari~
What a pimp
get a super long treadmill thingy and form a conga line.
Dari?
Well I don't know any, I don't read fanfics. ::P
:P*
I meant is that what you want to hear?
Oh, yeah. Sounds good. :>
So anyway I ordered Apple fries from Burger King tonight!
:3
They were just cut up Apple slices...
link, G?
excelente
gimme a minute
:(
ok
But it did come with Caramel.
I thought Apple Fries were fried
That's what I thought, but no, they were just sliced up pieces of Apple that were meant to resemble the shape of fries.
you sure you weren't given apple dippers by mistake?
Apple + cheese
8Apple and cheese
For the epic win.
8celery and peanut butter
8<3
Celery with blue cheese. <3
8<3
8Blue cheese is amazing
SuperBrony64: It's common knowledge that apple and cheese is win.
8I like gorgonzola too
I like Israeli Feta.
Non-blue cheese.
:P
Well, I do like Provologne.
8tried...
I like creamy cheeses rather than the sharp stuff
8well, not sure hot to spell it
8wendsly dale? >> fail
I tried some really good cheese in France.
There was even goat's cheese, THAT DIDN'T TASTE LIKE GOAT.
wensleydale
That was a first for me.
It actually tasted nice.
8I liek certain goat cheeses
France…*sigh*
I want to go visit there someday
Smoked salmon & Israeli feta on a bed of cherry tomatoes & mixed greens and baby spinach. Splashed with a home-made mustard vinaigrette.
Been to France sooooooooooooooooo many times.
We go pretty much every other year.
8I miss Japan ;__;
How are the macarons there?
The closest I've been out of the United States was going to Mexico
I want to leave, but it's darn expensive
8I've been to Wales, Canada, Mexico, Japan, France... and all over teh US
Go to airport, fly somewhere.
Spend 2 weeks.
Fly back.
O_o
I don't want to go to Mexico and there's really no reason for me to go to Canada (besides seeing relatives)
8I love traveling <3
8SuperBrony64: get drunk party
8just kidding >>
Drunk imagination vacations just don't work :P
8I've never smoked, had alcohol or any kind of drugs before in my life o-o
The last time I went on vacation somewhere was like…4-5 years ago.
As far as I can remember.
Actually, more like 2-3, I did visit New York
Do you live in the US?
Who?
You. :P
Nah, England.
8<3 London and I'm trying to remember the area but I can't think of it...
8Miss the castles in the UK...
Relative compared to how far it is from the US to Europe
I've still been to the US. :P
8US... I like where I live thankfully... but that's because we have like 7 friggin national parks
It's trouble visiting other states in the US because they are mostly the same :/
Should I get on one of my costumes while we wait?
sure why not
>:3
It's way different to see what it's like in another country
Which one do you want?
I really hope to go somewhere in Europe when I graduate
Dari's seen them.
Anypony here?
Oh, heheheh.
Yeah.
*sigh* Oh well, a pony can dream :P
8look around for tours
8and stuff
what? tell me tell me tell me!
Yup
Memories.
Nostalgia.
;__;
I don't wanna Tour, I want to go and visit places on my own
<3 Good times.
You pick one Dari.
That's the thing, I don't wanna be a 'tourist'. I want to actually try and blend in to the places I go.
That's because
>go to Stonehenge
>Try to chip a piece off with a chisel
>SOUVENIR! KASDOPFKASL:DFKAS :LDFAJSD:FLGSKD:G
:P
8... I'm pretty sure that's illegal
Is that what people do?
Well I suppose we never finished off what happened last time. >_>
That's very stereotypical.... I don't personally know anyone who would do that.
<_<
XD
LOL
My sister.
Oh God.
Yup! Barely! :D
I'd go to France and eat at the McDonalds first night there just to mess with people.
In St Lucia, asked the barman.
"Do you have any strongbow?"
"Strongbow?"
"I'll show you strongbow"
"Sniff this, don't drink it"
>she takes a sip
>throat burning for next 30 minutes
XD
8wow
That was hilarious.
Sluttershy, kinky_pie, I have many.
MFW she thought they'd have strongbow.
*goes to site*
"Are you over the age of 21?" >Yes >No
>_>
Ughh…uhhhh….uhhhhhhhhh
^_^
So many choices...
Well, since Dari won't pick.... which one do you want?
Also, story link yet XD
i think the best costume is nothing at all, honestly :P
Pfft.
inb4 Spam kick
You probably can't kick me.
:P
8I wonder if I can'
well, I say costumes but they are really just characters.
8that would be interesting wouldn't it?
INB4 we find out
Hmm…that command doesn't work...
but Sluttershy is cool.
amd i know :P
...and
not affiliated with the cpu/graphics company
Still here?
inb4 Invading Ponies
Damn
Heheh.
8o-o
Ayup
I'm good
I'm about to upload my fanfic, but i'm thinking of editing a few things
so Sluttershy... as long as it doesn't affect your awesome voice
8that was...
8>>
8interesting
/me walks into the room. "Hmm, interesting..."
8GAH
8Shadowmane is evil!
Choosing between Derpy and Ditzy's name, for example
8I know he's evil!
Oh. Well Sluttershy will be here for the pre-party.
wait....
Evil? My my, such a thing applied to me?
not sure of the proper terminology for that XD
But firstly, if you saw a fanfic titled 'Friendship is Surreal', what would be you first impression?
fluffing?
8>>
/me 8goes back to normal Fluttershy` mode instead of Flutterrage
How…how…how could you?
If the children are born, perhaps it is too late for that.
That it will be delightfully surreal
What's the accent on your name Fluttershy` ?
8Fluttershy is for bot use only... =_+
Hmm...
I mean, its a comedy, but not a particularily crazy/random one
Oh damn, I remember that now
/me tuts at the sad situation.
/me thinks of the game Myst
My first impression would be "This takes place on another planet or during a dream...
Lawl, Myst.
8I am more powerful than you here!
Hmm... violetvanilla is it? Such a lovely young filly... how are you this fair eve?
Old games are old.
Not sure what to make of that description... lol
anyway....
Yeah.
8If you even put one hoof on me OR VIOLETVANILLA I will kick your sorry ass to the MOON!
never heard of myst
Oh look, I brought a guest.
Imma leave for a minute.
warhunterT71: Really?!
One of the biggest video games in history
Yep.
8I mean. Um...
8B-Because I can... and... I don't like you... -squeaks- ><
It's a series of puzzle games, set on a worlds... with puzzles and realms linked with books, that you put your hand on and materialze to the next world...
*sigh* Miss Fluttershy`, as much as I may or may not desire otherwise, I would never do such a thing. Poaching is not proper behavior for a true gentlecolt.
With real people in it too at times, shot on chromakey
8I... I still don't like you... ><
warhunterT71: ^^ Basic Info on it...
:)
Well, i'm probably gonna upload my fic now under the name friendship is surreal, unless i can think of a better name
Not particularily focused on friendship, though...
I was too young for the game when I first played it, it confused the hell out of me. XD
I never played it
That is quite alright. I do not need your approval, simply your acceptance that i am here for now.
I played the third game, then the 2nd and the 1st, then the 4th and the 5th
/me actually visited Cyan Worlds
8I JUST NOTICED that there's a gingerale in this room <3
I think I played Myst 3.
D:
A what?
The first game came out 2 years before I was born.
Oh!
Hi!
I got to see End of Ages material before the game came out
/me 8hugs gingerale tightly
/me hugs back <3
/me just got here, so has a better excuse than Fluttershy'.
zaco: Do u remember Myst Uru online?
So what is this about? ^^
Yeah
It was released by cyan
I sometimes poke on their once in awhile
What's what about?
about 2 months ago
inb4 Sluttershy
for free
8I love gingerale <3 It's my favorite soda
Yeah I have the free version
Ahh.. xD
though I bought the game when it came out
There's a Shadow of the Colossus rip-off in Skyward Sword? Sold.
Huh, we call it ginger beer I think.
I kinda hate the 5th game
I like it too.
I never got around to end of ages
zaco: Don't play it...
8ginger beer is stronger than gingerale actually... much more gingery but I like ginger beer too <3
It's laggy, and slow...
umm... Hi
the real time 3d stuff seemed like kinda a bummer
and the puzzles suck!
heh... thankyou.
I only want African Creme or Bailey's
End of Ages killed the series
Uru wasn't particularily good either even though I enjoyed it
the online component of that game was completely broken
What made them jump from Myst 4... to Myst 5
Hah, my sister loves Baileys
One with FMV Scenes
but of course.
suddenly to complete 3D
My dad put lemon juice in it.
>curdle king
Are you beginning to see why he has that name yet?
8pickles and milk... doesn't sit well in my stomach... e-e
So myst 5 has no live action guys?
zaco: None at all
That's pretty terrible
Not one second
*cough....*
Completely 3D Dudes, speaking
I like Olives
Plain pickles and milk, I can understand.. <.<
Sounds lazy
Green one specifically.
going that direction
finally, my cloud is here. I'd better take it before it passes.
8I like purple olives and green olives both
Huh
/me scrapes the ground nervously
/me dreams of furries in the arctic.
Though to be fair, at the time that game came out, Cyan Worlds was on the brink of basically being disbanded
and they did
I played it for 10 minutes, then I put the CD in the Microwave and watched it burn in hell...
I'm guilty of drinking the juice that remains in the Olive jar :3
but they're still kinda around, being saved at the last minute
XD
Well, not a lot of it
Tovler: Lawl
Someone added cutiemarks to the Equestria Online source. Sweet! xD
I really want another Myst Game
One that's more like Myst III
The Engine was perfect
Question of the day: What's the difference between a gherkin and a pickle?
Custom or a selection of cutie marks?
I don't think they've made a final decision on that. ^^
So I won't say anything.
Okay : )
Gherkin's are sweet?
Yeah but it seems like its done at this point
8Your mom
they said myst 5 was the end
SuperBrony64: Nope.
I don't actually know.
But I know it's not that.
:P
8... you troll
8>>
Yeah, but they've already broke that rule
by re-releasing Uru
well no they didn't, they didn't re-release uru
Gherkins aren't cucumbers. Pickles are.
well
I guess they did, sorta, rebranded as Myst Online
but they didn't make new assets
8gingerale knows all! <3
/me IS SMRT
I don't think that's true in the UK.
Maybe in the US.
I wonder how many problems with inappropriate symbols they would have, and whether the Brony community would continue as it has been and not use middle fingers and anatomy as cutie marks...
I really think they should start an open source project
to create a new Myst Game
Instead of them making it...
Well there's this incredibly cool skill system under works for it. So I'm hoping the cutiemarks will reflect that. ^^
8My cat is a wimp...
people adding to it...
Nice!
hi.
MissingPony: It's simple to have it so custom cutie marks have to be approved
People could probably just take matters into their own hands and just make fan games without fear of lawsuit
because no one will care
Hello dearies! :D <3
hello.
just thinking bout the new episode...
But isn't what they are doing with Uru Online
aw thanks
Number of users I doubt would be more than 50,000 at most.
*gives hug back to CrystalClear*
in a way saying "Do as you wish with this..."
/me 8blinks. "Huh?"
actually...
I don't get any signs of affection?
Don't worry about me! I'll be okay
i was just about to...
I'll just go back over in the corner of the internet here...
*hug for superbrony64*
and
*hugs for everypony*
8I have an announcement...
/me 8turns into a tree
???
:O
SuperBrony64: I haven't gotten any affection either. But, then again, I'm Missing : )
Hard to show affection to somepony who's missing.
/me takes a nap under Fluttershy`-Tree
Lol.
Fluttershy wood do that!
(pun intended)
/me pats MissingPony and SuperBrony64 on the head. "You know I'd never forget you!"
she wood
Is that a pun or bad grammar?
I can't tell.
8both? )
/me smiles at CrystalClear. "Thanks!"

Guys, a little question:
No wait, this one. http://i.imgur.com/PIhVz.gif
bracing for epic question
Did anybody here saved a log of the chat when the chapter aired?
I do
Well, my client automatically does it
But if I dug through it with some effort I could find something...
What's your client?
Well I guess I... I'll just leave then.
Yeah.
Colloquy
never got to actually meet him
I wonder if Cyan would ever release the First 4 Games on iOS?
Mobile?
I'd love to see that...
8hey guys I'm tired if you're spamming tell me okay? lol
8so then I can kick you XP
I think I've been Spamming...
Spamming? Oh dear, sounds like a waste of ham. Which you shouldn't eat, as herbivores can't process meat.
8oh u..
ah, what? me spam? never....
(wonders, "would i?")
i
think
you
would
if
you
were
feeling
up
to
it
:D
hmmmmm
if i was paid a million dollars i would feel up to it...
probably
its a million... oh wait.
million bits!
soooooo
Fluttershy`: Really
/me 8falls over (still as a tree)
oh no :O
SuperBrony64: The log it could be in ~/Library/Application Support/Colloquy/
*helps fluttershy up*
stream non-stop hamtaro till next episode
(well....)
its 3:10 am here...
yay
so.
I wish Minecraft had pink leaved trees ^^
i suppose i can say
i have a fever...
Maybe I should edit the textures to make birch trees have pink leaves
and the only prescription is more ponies.
eeyup
hey actually.. during those random streams of shows.. was detective conan/case closed ever shown?
either that or chat
8mmm.......
So then.
cant say
Dari?
/me 8turns back into regular Fluttershy` "so tired..."
im only here on occasion
alright well that's one thing i really wanna see.. i wonder what watching that with a chatroom full of people would be like
have to wonder if theyll stream "are you afraid of the dark?" next month
i used to watch it as a kid...
i've definitely seen that.. don't really remember it all that much
I've drawn Detective Conan fanart once. For a friend. She was making a story where poor Conan ended up posing as a girl.
So I drew him in a dress. ^^
just the lighting of the match or whatnot
wait how is "Friendship is surreal" too long?
Dari
you didn't fall asleep on me did you?
sorry i'm not into guys.. link anyway? for science?
dari-beep, dari-beep, dari-beep
and 'chapter 1'
doesn't fit, stupid DA
8she blinded me with science!
lol but seriously i wonder how that would turn out
friendship is surreal s1?
errr
/me levitates Fluttershy` off the ground and into bed. "You need some rest, dearie. My boy has enough trouble on his hoofs without a grumpy filly."
c1
Okay, I'm back
Now then, Letti, what did you mean by the new chapter?
lol
If anyone wants to see the Conan drawing's here. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13406580/conan%20fanarty.png
or i could change the name
Took me forever to get the hang of the original artist's style xD
I'm guessin he did :(
it's not 100% yet
8ggrbbb....
But eh, it didn't turn out too bad at all.
No, the last chapter.
Last chapter of what?
The name only allows 30 characters
I suppose it depends on what it's about. Obviously Friendship is Surreal is supposed to be a play on "Friendship is Magic"
that's 100X better than i expected
fifteen minutes, no messages
hmm? What was that, Flutter dear?
maybe
yep
/me 13wonders if pink is taken by other mod
Octavia has pink I think...
/me 8is sticking to yellow then
Or VioletVanilla
It's a humorous mirror of the show using a set of BG ponies
well... its sunday. yay.
I forget...
octavia
I'm thinking of doing Part 1, maybe?
That could work
btw... i feel like saying "are you afraid of the darK" seems to only be aired in october now...
The first chapter of the second season.
even though it was aired all the time in the 90s...
The_Mole: Is that show still on the air?
I was hoping to use part 1 as the chapter name, buuuut
No, I'm still here.
I used to watch it all the time.
8does yellow stand out ok?
in reruns, yes
Fluttershy`: More than enough :P
though the original series ended in 1997 or something
yellow on black? quite well Flutter dear.
you see, since it mirrors the show, the first two chapter were going to be Ch1 part 1 and Ch2 part 2
i actually remember when it ended...
For my black background, yes/
8hehehehhehhehhehhehhehehhehhehhehe I mean in all the white
DARI <3
with a name inbetween, of course
We thought we's lost you.
But then i could rename chapter 2 and call them all parts
Lemme find out
well thanks for teh linkz gingerale you draw pretty darn good
<3 still here just about XD
then there was a reboot of the show in 1998, i think. didnt last long, fans dont seem to like it as much but i thought it was alright
Thanke!
well... time for fanfic then?
Actually, it looks unreadable
you missed Sluttershy completely <_<
8I made teh marathon poster for last night... ;__; now my beautiful movie poster is no longer needed
it'll be stored for the annals, i'm sure
>a user named The_Mole on #BronyState. i can now command the servers to tell me /whois The_Mole ?!
Hah.
It was a nice poster.
actually, i'll rename chapter one
Yes, read to us.
Your yellow text is distracting because whenever I'm mentioned it beeps and highlights the text in yellow. xD
ok :3
leave chapter 2's name... hmmm...
So I keep thinking all those things you say are directed to me
*EHEM*
You mean the one that has all the Mane 6 with various foods and drinks?
8gingerale hehehehe
SHADOW!!! *fan-squeal*
/me looks at Crystalclear. "Oh shi-!"
8yes Shadowmane =_+ trolololololo
SuperBrony64, the log looks unreadable?
Letti: I still don't know what it is you are looking for...
What last chapter?
/me rushes Shadowmane, her magic locking down his shadowjump abilities.
>fluttershy` start's using yellow text >gingerale's self-esteem shoots through the roof
Oh crap... *braces for impact*
Hahaha xD
G'night y'all!
My highlight text is red.
Night MissingPony
Every line you speak, Fluttershy`, is another pump of air into my ego!
goodnight missingpo :D
Stop while you're still safe!
8yay~
xD
my skype is ready
Goodnight, Missing <3
I just check whether the name of the person/timestamp is red too when people type in red.
When the first chapter of the second season, the yesterday morning chapter, if you have any logs of this chat when that chapter aired.
Automatic reaction
my bo- skype is ready also.
/me glomps Shadowmane. "SHADOW! SHADOWSHADOWSHADOWSHADOOOOWWWW!!!"
Dari?
Letti: Oh I see, lemme check
Yeah.
8....
8whoever posted vid to 'safety dace Discord' congrats. It is now stuck in my head.
You can dance if you want to, you can leave your friends behind. Cuz your friends don't dance and if they don't dance then they're no friends of mine...
8....Shadowmane I can kick you for trolling I hope you know >>
/me hugs CrystalClear lightly, a forced smile on his face. "Oh hey... Crystal... darling... how ermm... are you?"
Hmm.. Let's see..
Stuff starts at 3 pm today for the comic festival. ^^
Will need to go there <3
/me turns on Fluttershy` "HOW DARE YOU THREATEN MY HUBBY"
Ohw ait no, noon!
for some reason that is.... so fitting with the new episode
Fry: That dance wasn't as safe as they said it was.
Hello all.
hi
welcome to the chat room
8I can kick you too CrystalClear if you get too annoying >>; mebbe
Yesterday I spotted a Kanaya and a Vriska cosplayer! <3
/me fades into nothing as CrystalClear's shadow falls onto him. He wipes sweat from his brow as he does so
Wishing I had a camera D:
Oh poo... he got away again.
i kept feeling upset that i stayed up late..
owell, I'll get him next time
not anymore..
Oh grats on mod Fluttershy`
well, since like half an hour ago
8oh thanks Sumica! <3
Damn, the entire 15 MB transcript is still loading.
oh yes.,... congrats on mod fluttershy...
lol
sounds like my mom is walking up the stairs...
maybe...
yes
yes she did
I don't think I have the transcript actually :/
These files seem to just record whatever amount of the chat it feels like.
What is Fluttershy` a mod of?
Really? Can you upload that anyway?
8gingerale: I am a mod for here )
But.. You don't have the powers. D:
Shouldn't you at least be half-opped?
8I am brand-new mod... only have kicking powers for now ^^;
8it's up to Dari to give me more power or not
Through a bot or something?
if a cat was pestering your dog by staying in your yard, giving your dog fleas, what would you do
because i have like three cats hanging around outside from time to time....
would you take a squirt gun and squirt the cats?
*guess
it comes to mind...
That makes you a sneaky mod!
8yeah
all of a sudden... im enjoying "oranges and lemons", an album by XTC, a lot more
hooray
think im getting into it because of the bass lines...
/me 8lays down on ground. "Zzz...."
oh.... my
youre... not sawing longs are you
I love this ^^ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AePz1J1hZwo
Colloquy, Y U GO AND FREEZE?!
Anyway
heh
been trolled vid...
Letti: I'll send you the transcript as long as it's okay with a Mod. I keep them for just personal reasons, but I don't want to give it out freely.
...
Even though he is made from different parts of various species, he is 100% troll.
It's ok, I understand.
/me has returned, let the shipping COMMENCE
Okay, I put on my wizard hat and robe..
Good. I select... THE_MOLE to be your partner, SuperBrony64. Enjoy.
any room for shipping CrystalClear/ShadowMane?
*child innocence destroyed*
GGgala, that's already been done. literally. it's canon
hence why I exist... *cries*
8Oooh CC is your mommmmyyy?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH5TR6dtVzU <--Why can't I be as brave as these guys?!
8whahaha
8I will make you one don't worry and you can buy it from me sound good? I make better ponies than they have in store anyway prolly
All I want to do is just get one of the small Fluttershy action figures. IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?!
yes
Fluttershy`: Really? Deal :P
(because i have dibs on them all)
8I need to get my hands on clay of course first but I'm sure that wont be too hard to do
8to hard to do* ah what is happening to me?
I hate what they did to Princess Celestia as a toy.
I don't think she would be so inclined for some 'peasant' to comb her mane...
8yes...
Yeah. Uploading fic to DA like a boss.
The main toys I would want are the toys that came with the McDonalds Happy Meals
But those are lost with time :(
Well now that i finaly get to sit and enjoy the ep I must say it was quite good.
The Return of Harmony Part 1?
Episode 201
I enjoyed it as a strong start for things to come in the show, but I felt it was very abrupt in the beginning.
Yes SuperBrony64
i'm totally looking forward to when we have episode 1001 to brag about
Dose seem they just said oke play this role as if you would play Q
Who's Q?
Q as in... Bond? or... umm...
Q as in star trek
Oh, never saw Star Trek (at least the newer one) :P
I found this video of Q: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBwoEXlTph0
Sounds exactly like Discord >_<
For reffrence http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M405eU4niYw&feature=related
So…Q decided to troll ponies instead of star fleet?
exactly
liveing forever can get boreing I would guess.
So, Data is a robot?
android
but yes
nice top comment on your link ">get bored trolling Starfleet captains
>go to﻿ Equestria and troll ponies instead
"
anypony still here?
:P
Here
Got it uploaded?
Blossom -> Twilight Sparkle, Bubbles -> Fluttershy, Buttercup -> Rainbow Dash
There, I've made reason with the universe.
oh Lauren Faust, why you so uber
My God, what would happen if she remade My Little Pony: FiM with MORE Lauren Faust goodness...
BTW, best Powerpuff Girls scene: http://youtu.be/gY93YDa8TiA
I'm certainly not, warhunterT71
I don't believe I've asked you yet, warhunter - do you know of any particularly good non-romantic/smut fanfics featuring Rarity?
So what names has everyone come up with for the corupted elements I am sure there are names already.
Elements of Chaos
ment the individual ponys. But that works too.
Flutterbitch, Phonyjack, Snarity, Meanie Pie, and Run N' Dash
Do I win?
uh i guess.
still here?
@symmetry no
Next, i'm going to spend the next half hour figuring out FF.net
Let's all go watch the Time channel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4LSHvXE3TM&NR=1
why is this moskau song SOOOOOOOOO good?
And, I have the second chapter already written, do you think i should upload it now?
The same reason why rubbing a Q-tip in your ear feels soooooo good.
wait Moskau as in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQAKRw6mToA
warhunterT71: damn. Nobody seems to
yes that
lol, i don't know any fanfics that prominently feature rarity
Epic 80's hair and disco beat perhaps?
there's Simply Rarity, which is wonderful
lol well the costumes are awesome but the music is extremely energetic
Rarity's New Dress is sort of like (spoilers ahead) Rarity!Cupcakes
at least it is imo
Because it is song of mother Russia?
Or "The Carousel Boutique Expansion Project" in the same vein
in soviet russia song sings you
rarity version of cupcakes what?
Anyway, do you think I should upload chapter 2 of my fic immediately?
The "Hush Now Quiet Now" video on YouTube frightens me...
g'day from downunder
It's usually best to let writing sit for awhile
^ which one?
yeah...
THAT one
Donraj: in the horror vein, then?
Type it in YouTube, third video from top
damn
I do not like horrorfics or romance fics
Rarity being a sociopath, basically
So, did you read my fic?
I know I'll just get in trouble for posting the link here for it >_<
not yet, warhunterT71, I'm in the middle of a few others
Not yet
but yours is in a tab
I will in a minute
oh.. i kinda thought it was that one
kthanks
But the way the vocals are done is very...calming
i didn't really remember what music that video was to
I don't know who would spend time drawing Fluttershy like that...
kind like the Outlawstar and one peice ones posted today.
I love the One Piece one
Very accurate :P
i started watching it.. looked at the comments and started laughing through it.. am i doing this right?
I never realy got in to One peice but it's still good.
It's funny, I got my computer partially wiped soon after I became a brony
It's damn good, especially now.
I remember watching One Piece
And now my downloads folder and my history are ALL pony
MeteorVenture: There really is no set way for tackling that video. Just take it for face value…no pun intended :P
ITS ALIVE
Wut's alive?
This chat?
lols.. also there's some REALLY chill and REALLY depressing hush now quiet now song.. i wanna find it again.. i might have already found it but it's not exactly how i remember it
Haha, that Equestria Girls video is cool
His bot
But very ironic having guys singing it
I see this one making it in to luna's play list
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aznlBiIf9TQ
wow not many on now, from 20 hrs ago it was packed :P
…hoping I'm in the right for using the word 'ironic'
o...k
Sumica: That video is full of win
did they ever show spirited away or princess mononoke on brony movie night?
Did you guys see the dramatic reading of the MLP fic 'Hardon Lewdad' or whatever it's called on YT?
8I'm still here by the way. I still have um... kickhammer
it's way better then I could ever do given how quick it was made.
No
kickhammer?
HAMMER HAMMER!
I dont think they do anime for movie nights.
That doesn't sound very threatening...
mm..and i spelt my name wrong..
aww.. but anime has some of the best movies:/
lol
Steamboy
Enough said.
flutter kick eh? no I think I will not let my mind go that way.
Sumica:…Touché
steamboy.. i think i've heard of that
8well I can't ban, but I can kick at least
MeteorVenture: OMG, Go to YouTube and watch it.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gNrM8dXRw8&feature=player_embedded very funny
Haha, it's only two hours long :P
They are good movies i just dont think they will use them. Perhaps on off nights. 8shrug*
hopefully we get grave of the fireflies for the B movie soon (although it's not really B quality)
That was A quality
ya but people FEEL like it's a B movie if you know what i mean
It's A quality, but doesn't have a large fan base
(╯°□°）╯彡┻━┻
Mainly because it is very depressing
^ lol
And stay down.
not the tables, i just fixed taht one.
ohhh steamboy.. is that good? cause the general type of movie it looked like didn't seem that appealing to me
i mean obviously you just redirected me to youtube..
It is one of the highest budget Anime movies to date. Storyline is awesome and the visuals are second to none.
alright checkin'
Plus the soundtrack for it is just pure bliss.
>implying you can find it on youtube
Wouldt mind Appleseed being showen my self.
Yes you can
It's available with ads every 14 minutes in it.
I really wanted that to be the A movie this week :/
i'm not.. i will try to find it on some other anime site lol
that uses megavideo.. tables will be flipped and set rightly again in those 72 minutes of wait time
i mean i think it bumped up to 72 now
not sure
That tail whip Fluttershy did to Twilight in the new episode was awesome.
8darn it... I don't think I can kick people when it's so late at night and there are so few people... walls of text make sense I know it's not spam but my brain sees text and I think 'spam'!
http://ponyfictionarchive.net/viewstory.php?sid=103 how do I find all the sad fics
this is ridiculous
You're going to kick one out of the three people here right now?
nah the only place i would watch it is not in the greatest quality
so.. youtube it is
(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
┳━┳﻿ﾉ﻿(. _. ﾉ)
8eh....
8just trying to do my duty... e-e; and still a bit on high alert after all of that... insanity... yesterday
/me peeks head in
Phonyjack: "Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 is a good game!"
Yeah sorry for the undue stress Fluttershy`
Fluttershy`: Your duty is to just sit back and sort out the wrong from the right. Be passive rather than active.
8blegh I still have fun talking to you guys of course too
8I think there's only a couple mods even awake right now... >>
lol
Mods just keep order when there are dozens of users chatting at once to help make sure everyone has an equal and fair opportunity to share their opinions.
no, seriously
8MMmm true dat
every fic I click on ff or pfa turns out to be extra sad
When someone abuses that privalege or even posts inappropriate stuff, that's when to fire up the ban cannon.
8ban cannon lawl xP
8to the mooooonah!
:P
well youtube has marginally better quality
MeteorVenture: Yeah, and you won't get sent to the moon for watching it :D
OMG Fluttershy` dont let Dis.... SuperBrony64 coroupt you =p
lol >implying
8rawr
lol, if that's what you call corruption…*rolls eyes*
8I guess I'm easily corrupted XP I'm so new. I've only been here for 2 bmn
/me is the only true Discord
yeah but you are popular and omg a gurl
so is Luna and VioletVanilla
I don't mind sad, to be honest
but then again i'm drunk off tired
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
some of them are really good
Yeah they are Silvermane and they too are popular, notice when they talk bronys listen.
warhunterT71: so far, as a classical musician who you would call, in the words of your fic, a 'professional professional,' this fic is making me perturbed
Time for a mutiny!
mainly vinyl scratch showing up
:P
Well, I'll be going for now, but I'll be back someday.
And thanks, SuperBrony64.
Later Letti
Keep that up Fluttershy` and he will come back asking for more.
written well, though
good characterization
8...oh gawd don't even say that! Not with /his/ fetish!
and yeah, sad can be amazing, but still it's sad
If I was captain of this ship, all I would ask from my crew mates was complete loyalty. If that were the case, they could prance around in their underwear drinking beer for all I care.
He already does, I mean, he is the king of shipping
>_<
btw why is it that people named after chars from the show get more attention and have better chances at being mods?
/me is the MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE
discuss lol
MeteorVenture, Luna became Luna during her modship i do believe
and Fluttershy is... well... Fluttershy. can't top #1 pony
Because people believe that those users are THOSE certain characters.
....wait what Fetish?
8>>
8<<
8I said nothing
8no fetish
8that's naughty
8spam
what?
8spam
8spam
8xP
did i miss fluttershy talking about fetishes again?
Yeah, now I'm interested, what fetish were you talking about ??
Silver, what fetish?
his fetish
superbrony64 that's pretty much what i think.. at least they like to think of the idea of them being from the show
8wow that was fun
my fetish?
Well, I think it's pretty cool.
what about my fetishes?
It's like going to Disneyland and seeing all the characters in costumes.
oh dear dose Fluttershy` look a tad more gray to anyone else?
The best ones are the human characters without the foam suits
the bit about her being a professional professional was sort of meant to be from Lyra's perspective
They actually talk like the character they are representing
Sumica: REFERENCES!
Ah, it didn't go into italics. I'd better fix that
if someone is talking about what kink's i have, it involves B and D.
i just feel that it's kind of unfair.. but i can't complain really.. it's just how it is
8RAWR I am the element of... of...
indeed SuperBrony64, it'as all new to me still >_<
THE KICK HAMMER!
8oh dear... what's the opposite of kindness?
Element of pms?
bitchiness?
meanness
8...Sumica >>
8Revolver!
XD
8><
I'm sticking with my answer
8....don't... make me... kick you...
Hulu you disapoint me. Dubbed Bubblegum Crisis.
also no offense to anyone who uses names like that lol
Fixed the italics. I though i'd already put them in, oh well, lol
just a note, though: the instrument Octavia plays seems a lot more like a cello than a double bass; its body is narrower and its body flatter than otherwise
I knew people would argue about the instrument, lol
I went by this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st9CxveZieg
So about this Fetish Silver...
time to learn the science of likeability and implement it for kicks.. then throw it all away and live out my days saying i completed my goals
I originally thought it was a cello
8>>; but... I promised to keep it a secret... Pinkie will pop into a mirror and kill meee!
it's his fetish Sumica
/me appears
you guys do know fetish doesn't only mean THAT kind of fetish right?
that's just 1 use for the word
Okay…moving along from this topic…I love this gif: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/59821
yeah I wanted to know what kind of tiki mask he has, why what did you meen?
8Flutter... Flutter.... something
Alright here we go...
I maintain cello, after watching that video, based on the looks of the instrument - I've seen cello of many sizes, including larger than normal, and the position in which she plays it is too low for a 4'4'' pony on double bass
Time
Something something darkside, something something complet.
8FlutterDark?
DarthShy? wait no that sounds like a ship.
fightershy
/me appears again
Curse you, wireless internet!
/me glomps
/me 8is glomped hehe hi
This comic makes me cry :(
so.. Fightershy it is
One of my friends finished watching something earlier and said, "But... now what do I watch?"
meh, too early to be sad to me.
It seems kinda out of character to me that Octavia is so blase about her instrument being damaged.
Well
I require a pony image to reply with, implying that she should watch ponies OuO
Not out of character since there is no established character
We watch The Office premiere on September 22nd!
But still
Kinda strange for someone who's presumably a dedicated musician
Meh, I wanted it to be funny. I presumed her reaction would happen outside the story, to be honest.
GrimGallop: Use http://www.mylittlefacewhen.com/
I'll remember that next time.
I recomend http://pichars.org/store/4414_original_tumblr_ln2xjuRLOy1qb5gkjo1_400.jpg
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/216/
8gahhhhh
/me 8dies
Yeah, i kinda failed there.
lol @ Sumica
Why, if I ever met one of them "fetish' thingies, I'd laugh at how silly they are.
Also, lulz @ Silvermane
/me 8is dead
8MY DOG IS DEAD! )
i'am looking over my dead dog rover, who i hit with a power mower.
/me casts Revenance on Fluttershy`
also GrimGallop http://www.mylittlefacewhen.com/f/552/
Fluttershy`: WHAT?!?!
Seriously?!
(I am not dead, and stop calling me your dog)
What's going on now? o.O
8....no one caught the reference? >> )
Oh damn, I actually thought you were serious for a moment there
:<
I0m actually wondering what's going on too...
Although, I don't know why you would chat about something like that...
Nope D:
oh cool Miyazaki has done a new movie.
8...has anypony seen the movie I speak of
8?
Sorry Fluttershy` too random for me...
wait did I just say that.
umm...
"my dog is dead!!!" *slap*
…No
Fluttershy`, *you* are so *rando*-- wait...
8...The Man Who Knew Too Little. HILARIOUS movie
8Bill Murray
8watch it
quick! draw a buff pinkie pie with a gun and have rainbow dash say "pinkie pie you are so rambo"
Ah. I've seen it. Well, kind of. Parts of it.
More like, "My brother was watching it and I was kind of half-paying attention to it while trying to sleep once"
Anyways, pretty sure I've got it somewhere around here on DVD XD
8somepony find part on on youtube or full movie if possible?
all i can find is Rambodash
anyone enjoying my jokes or should i just go play earthbound? cause i'm about to anyway but just wanna know cause feedback is hard to come by
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho0Wem8rEiU
?
8wooot!
8WATCH IT PLEASE <3
8if you can everypony it really is an amazing movie
the man who knew too little is a slice of life movie about an ordinary person
jk i might watch it though
Oh here ,found this in my wikiwalking. http://i982.photobucket.com/albums/ae306/oratheowl/Fullmetal_Alchemist-1.png
8Sumica: YES! win!
Anyway, it's time for me to head off to bed. Have fun every pony! See you all (maybe) tomorrow!
nice
8aww night SuperBrony64!

I forgot that I had this here... I need to save this image~
*rimshot*
listening to moskau once again then on to earthbound prolly
not that i'm leaving lol
.... my god, so in my wanderings I found a 1500page pony thread on nation states.
just lurking more
Listening to Moskau? :O
it was started a week ago.
8GrimGallop: hell yeah
ya that song is.. some word that means it's very good and isn't overused
underground?
radical
g'day from australia!
far out
Link me to this radical song. I must see if it's the Moskau I'm thinking of :O
it probably is Grim.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQAKRw6mToA
the link in the description for the MP3.. i'm listening to that MP3
which is slightly different than the video but just a slight change
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjGUV4vZ0M
Hm. Not the same, but still shiny :P
Mornin' Guys
lol so what moskau were you thinking of?
What happened after I left? Anything particularly shiny?
something underground?
i left rather early myself
still the Dinkypage stream?
Actually, I was thinking of either Moskau by Rammstein or Moskva by Lyube.
Grim, you can't just brute force yourself through everything
even though it works quite often
I didn't. I went looking for a newspaper stand to find out about anything suspicious going on :P
That's a rather smart thing to do
To which they said, after noticing I had left while they were talking, "Oh, crap. Did Gall just go off on his own?"
Don'T split the party?
Which I don't blame them for XD
Don't you know, you never split the party~
Wizard in the middle, where he can shed some light~
And you never let that damn thief out of sight~
thank luna you didn't have a killerD,M huh?
XD
this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbyTLRYO7I
cause it's pretty chill
8grim grim grim grim are you spamming? XD
I don't think any DM would kill a player for independently searching for information, unless he deliberately confronted the boss face-to-face, one-on-one
Uh oh!
Just reciting lyrics, Fluttershy` T_T
8OH! RobotPinkie!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rCv-1wBHa0
8<3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjGUV4vZ0M
Hay Fluttershy` <3
grimgallop do you mean that song? cause i couldn't find anything that exactly said moskva and lyube in the same video.. and there wasn't much to pick from
the one i posted
A lot of people in here today.
Yes @ MeteorVenture :P
ok thanks lol:D it's pretty good
/me glomps RobotPinkie. "I haven't hugged you in a while. Want some shipping?" He licks him on the cheek.
Haha :D
/me hugs Silvermane
8RobotPinkie: check PM
I don't remember how I stumbled across those guys, but they're pretty cool. I think I was looking for a song that Rammstein did a cover of and stumbled across some of their stuff.
Gonna go PTFO have fun with your overnight shipping.
that's cool lol.. i got some pretty obscure stuff i've stumbled across so i know how it is lol
3,08Outb4kick
ptfo = put the fire out?
probably meant GTFO
pity the fool oldschool?
Now I want a Mr. T Pony
the p is way across the keyboard from g lol
Speaking of which, have you created a pony image for your character yet? :D
Oh, it works :P
8XP
o.O
8You can also use colors~
not yet
/me 10licks RobotPinkie

10good morning indeed
8Now that I'm a mod... want a REMATCH?! >:3
/me loves all everypony here

/me needs more coffee
10Fluttershy` it's too early in the morning for a rematch, and now I'm scared I'll lose ;3
Rematch in what?
I'm up for a fight
8RainBroDash: Why? Because I can do this?
ah! you're right! it is early in the morning! no wonder my jokes were not well received
Grim, where do I get a template for PonyPic
/me 10looks away for half a second
10>kicked
yeah
it was pretty funny
8<3 you anyway RainBroDash XD
/me glomps RainBroDash "MAI WAIFU!!"
Mod War II the RETURN OF THE REVENGE WITH A VENGEANCE
Use that
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH BIG WAIFU
/luna-celestia episode 2 hug
you are great pony grim
10Silvermane, Fluttershy` is trying to take you from me again. I doubt my chances now she's a mod :<
What's this? RainBroDash is trying to take Silvermane from me? D:
I have my fullest faith in you, rainbrodash. After all, you kept me through MirthTinker and her filly on filly advances.

10MFW I tried to kick GrimGallop in a hilarious way
oh well,
Flutterguy voice is epic
/me 10doesn't have OP
/me leaves a pile of twinkies in the middle of the room for all ponys to nom..
8RainBroDash wait does that mean I'm more powerful than you right now?!

10apparently? D:
Does that mean RainBroDash is using colors against the rules? >=D
10GrimGallop eeeeenope. >:3
8eh he's still a mod
Dang. The name thing isn't wide enough to see if you have an icon or anything :(
8it would show on mIRC
10well I don't have ops because I'm lower on the list than some non-OPs, from what I can see?
Umm...
does that mean...
if the fight does occur...
8FlutterDOMINATION
I WANT IN ON THE FIGHT!
10D: D: D:
*whimper*
/me 10is too weak

FOAL
ONLY THE MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT SILVERMANE IS BEST AROUND
/end ego
I CHALLENGE YOU!
8I will kick you again Silvermane <3
/me 10apparently can't kick anypony
*whimper* yes ma'am sorry ma'am won't happen again ma'am
For some reason I imagine Silvermane as a paladin.
>.> it's the name, isn't it
Are you a paladin, Silvermane?
10OH THERE WE GO
Probably XD
I'm a Barbarian!
/me 10CACKLES MANIACALLY
/me hug RainBroDash. "That's mai waifu! ~<3"

%C06,15 Testing...

I suck at this
10XD
/me can be heard cackling in the distance. The lights go dark for a second, and GrimGallop stands before you when they return.
I need some breakfast and coffee
hrmm
8RainBroDash... >>
10:3
XD
/me goes and hides in the corner. "At least I know my ass is safe either way...."
I get to use intimidate!
06 I can do this, I guess...
But it's not allowed
You Spoony Bard
10Robotpinkie did you have your trial already?
8>3>
Anypony still aliiiiive?
/me 10has been too busy with Uni stuff to know what's going on
Spoony bard indeed. So have you created a pony image for yourself yet? :D
06,15 I need a manual and a sammich, stat!

10yeah robotpinkie
06,15Guess I'll keep it :P
10:D:D
I'll take that as a "No, and this pony generator is driving me to insanity."
06,15Now to figure out how to put this in a script...
8ho ho ho I have an idea
/me 10can't help you, since he cba with 'proper' irc and just uses mibbit like a baws
10my internet is realllllyyy slow today
can't be arsed is just another word for nothing left to lose
10:<
06,15No wait, that was "Freedom"
/me uses mibbit like a baws as well
/me hugs RainBrodash. "How are you waifu?"
Silvermane's created a pony image for himself, right?
10I'm okay, really tired though ;___;
06,15Can't use background colors in mibbit, though...
I know what you mean, it's 6 am here
/me 10doesn't need to, RobotPinkie. trololo

06,15/me cries... or something.
XD
great internet RBD
10almost beats my personal best: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1450460274.png
XD
Kind of makes me wonder how my internet is. All I really care about is that YouTube videos load slightly faster than they play :P
10mine don't..
we can beat that.. our internet went from 10 mbps to around 100X less or so and did that over and over.. depending on when we started a download it could go fast or really slow
glitchy internet is best internet
http://www.speedtest.net/result/1488947961.png
That was mine just now
oh and when we called the people to figure out the problem.. we only got 10's bwahahaha
10;_;
you jelly RBD?
you're in the 1/3 percentile
10revolver I jelly.

/me 10is going afk to watch an episode of k-on to let this 10 minute video buffer
lol
du-du-du-duuuu
MAGNETO!
8 hey RobotPinkie you using mIRC then?
Nope, using XChat.
magneato *snap*
Hi RP
8 I think I want to try that... is it free?
yep
Hey Turgle
http://xchat.org/windows/
uhm wait, xchat for windows is not free?
guess not
but it's free for linux
._.
A bit lagged here, modifying a Tcl script.
whatever
its cause linux has an x in it
:O
06,15So... Lets see here...
/me is now in color.
06,15Nice stuff.
asdf
hi
/me 10cheers at RobotPinkie
hello
06,15I still need breakfast, though... :P
/me robs RobotPinkie of her colors
Wait, robots don't have gender, do they?
grim this moskva music somehow kinda reminds me of jet set music
06,15No, though I'm guessing you should call me a "he" anyway. :P
more specifically jet set radio future though probably cause that's all i've played of that series
It's iffy
Objects tend to be female
People male
In english
The assumed gender is any person is male unless known other wise.
But a robot could be both
It is safe though
06,15How sexist of you :P
:D
10XD
English is a gendered language.
I assume people's genders online based on the character they've named themselves after (if applicable), unless otherwise specified :P
Not heavily but it still has grammatical gender
Blond and blonde
06,15So if French, but since they think vaginas are male, I tend to not listen to them...
06,15*so is
XD
Nice
Male female forms of the same word.
Yeah grammatical gender tends to lack "logic"
Anyways, I'm going to fall asleep watching some Star Trek in the other room. Hopefully I get through the episode I fell asleep during yesterday... I want to know what the heck is going on :P
i believe that it's actually correct to use he and such as the default
It is no neutral gender in English.
that's what i heard anyway.. until feminism kicked in and we can't do that anymore cause it's sexist somehow
I still do it and would even if female
oh, this is IRC?
ya i know lol.. i do too but i do change things up sometimes
Until English loses gender in that way I shall
I think so
06,15morning, WhatPayne
Good morning RobotPinkie
irc.ponychat.net?
And that won't happen till I'm long dead
Oh hia WhatPayne
How did you manage yesterday?
06,15Well, I saw the premiere, but I missed a bit of S1 marathon
i hope it never happens.. it'd be more embarrassing to say that wrong than it would to have a 50/50 chance of being right
cause that way it's a 100% chance of being wrong
Hi WhatPayne !
it only shows that you really don't know lol
I think arabic lacks gender past pure nouns.
Urdu might as well.
we could use "it" but that's just not right
Not 100%
Did you sleep during the S1 marathon?
RobotPinkie, how do you do colors on xchat? D:
With magic
When the episode 2 come?
^
06,15Nah, got called away in an emergency, kinda
06,15or well I had a 1 episode nap, before :P
When come the new episode\
i slept through it
Yeah I had to take nap too
...wow, it seems I've sparked a much larger discussion that I expected by complete accident (?)
Episode 2? Next Saturday Crossbow70
:D
GrimGallop aprently so
Tknx
i really just kinda felt like latching onto what you said and saying what i wanted to say since i had a chance lol
Lol
/me vanishes in his usual melodramatic fashion of being swallowed by darkness and swearing to return as he departs. Blah blah blah~
sometimes the things you want to say are the things that you never get a solid chance to say.. not appropriately anyway
have grim will travel
You could just say them on whim
And confuse people.
i do that too sometimes depending on what it's about.. i like serious discussions but most people avoid them and i understand why
They can cause issues when people you know disagree.
i avoid discussing serious things with seriously misguided people
which make up alot of the internet
Hehe
any alot of the internet will agree LOL
Yup
06,15oh... lol sent the message to the wrong name `Fluttershy
well i've never actually seen trouble caused by a serious discussion that i've gotten into.. at least as far as i can remember
I can't type that on here lack the input
:-* wonder who can render that....
the trouble starts when people be hateful
start being* lol
I could make my name impissable to enter for most of you I think
Say where did that Magneto thing originated from?
Some live stream. Think it was the brony pod cast one
They did a s1 marathon
and of course a decent few people decided to start being hateful to me in these serious discussions but since i wasn't being hateful back.. nothing happened and it was all fine and i left them to their hatred and that's that.. i don't hang around people like that anyway
And it had an annoying mageto add during gala
So RobotPinkie what did you think of the new ep?
06,15I thought it was pretty darn amazing, WhatPayne
It really was...
you can see a video of it on youtbue
youtube*
it's pretty funny that that same episode = gyrobowl too
the gala makes every ad more interesting
Say RobotPinkie, what's up with the colours?
Mods are alseep I think
post tardis
eh.. back to lurk mode
Back to trying to sleep
But you know will be weird just like last night. Stupid wacky too real seeming dreams.
Really feels like I'm in a tv show written and directed by pinkie pie
06,15My colors are very pretty, aren't they? :P
Mine are better
I support whites only!
Wait...
That came out wrong
Kick!
X3
06,15And no, mods aren't asleep, non-mods get auto-kicked when using colors.
Oh you mod now?
^
Or circumventing script? *slyface*
06,15Haha, no, the former.
10Slyfaces don't get past RBD
/me 10flexes
C.garts
Wait why do I always end up in #BronySate
I don't join it
what did the garbage picker say to the paper that flew away?
I just appear in in it...
come back here you piece of white trash
:|
Yeah you made anon leave in terror
Bad MeteorVenture
06,15and yeah I'm pretty sure the mods would ban me if I tried to circumvent the color restrictions
10;3
lol poor anon
i'm white btw so it's all ok right guise?... guys?
/me 10is teal IRL
Dari banned me yesterday....
even if i was black to begin with i've been in this basement far too long
jk though.. i don't have a basement!
10lolol dumori, what for? XD
My client whent funny
I managed to join every open room on the irc sever
But the mane 6 kick if you are in more than one
And my auto join is fast
10oh right
The result was epic kick spam
10do ho ho
In at least 6 channels.
Then after the 10 min ban in said rooms it auto joined just one again for no reason.
Dumb Client
guys i even had to look up what the name for a garbage picker was for that joke back there
10LASEFNHflblabfabflABSF;LSAF
10I can't even watch low quality youtube videos
10internet, fix thineself!
they're not THAT bad
dang.. what keeps me from actually going into lurk mode?
Zecora
She enchanted the chat
To be enchanting.
that's just evil
Ok I just landed new bedding. Damn this pillow is soft!
Launded
stop teasing me.. i already have to stay up for a while longer while tired
Landed makes sense but is wrong!
Muhahaha
and then even my flat pillow will feel great
actually i've not really been one for soft pillows.. if it's too soft it's impossible to get to sleep
sleeping on a rock.. now that will get you to sleep
Discord is Trolling
EQD
rar
10moo
you know when you're tired in the morning and can't get back to sleep cause you can't find anything different to sleep on? well i think that i probably could get back to sleep if i had something hard to sleep on.. like the ground
It's not squishy soft but just soft
squishy? what? lol
i dunno what that even means for a pillow
unless it was filled with gel or something
and made of rubber
sounds like a legit pillow that i would never want to use
Lol
As ints not much more than flat
alright lol
Just feels stupidly soft
But probable way too much so
Can see my self just rubbing my face on it and not sleeping
i'm gonna be going to sleep and my pillow is just going to start singing "i'm flat! i'm flat" and such
X3
then i realize i have weird al's pillow
Get a blue pillow then it can sing a cover.
a blues pillow lol
And yeah bad pun
actually my pillow case is blue
That or singing I'm blue
we're off squadalee squadalah

/me like a spider to the ceiling doth Dumori go
/me is scared of ceiling beings
then suddenly we stand still too long and dumori drops down and grabs us
Like a Zelda mob
^ exactly
I'll dump you at the start of the dungeon one heart less
Morning comrades
I have a mental image of my pegaus OC with spider legs now
/me would see your shadow and dodge
Discord did it!
Oh hia aprotrate music.
To the Moon from the Majora's Mask sound track
Both creepy and from Zelda
link must have lived in soviet russia.. cause.. moon fly to you
Moon banished to the earth
seriously zelda was such an awesome RPG
Ja
Majora's mask is one of my fav child hood games
Sooooo awesome
ocarina of time and majora's mask.. also a link to the past.. i don't think i played any others though
Played the GC ones they ok-good
But not as good as MM
OoT was good MM was better
i got majora's mask later but i still found it to be just as awesome as ocarina of time.. i was surprised cause i expected it to be worse as sequels usually are
Same I found it better
I enjoyed the creepy as FUCK factor
oh heck ya
I mean wearing people's souls to turn it to them
That causes pain
To do
also getting all the masks was fun.. especially when someone already told you that you need a walkthrough to do it and you just accept it as a challenge
Lol
I did the do every thing in the 144 min challenge.
i'm not familiar with that challenge
After beating the game
You can play it endlessly
Well the challenge is to do ever side quest ect on the 144 mins you get
Running at 1/2 speed
how do you run at 1/2 speed?
One of the songs
You are told/hinted at
i didn't think you actually slowed down.. i must've forgot something
No but the in game time does
ya sure.. so wouldn't you be going 2X the speed?
oh nm
i see what you mean i think
Not quite you just get longer
well do that challenge on double speed and then come talk to me hahahaah
Well you can just fit in every side quest in the game and do the bosses and finarly
Is impossible
Its impossible with just 72 mins
i bet you could do it with TAS or something
well aside from cutscenes
Not the same you are taught that song to do that it's the true ending of the game but I don't think you get any reall changes
how about just speeding up the emulator X4 on half speed? that's doable lololol
Lol
Speed hack plus slow ingame time
Lol
wait.. are you spoiling things for a game i already thought i completed?
Sorry
that really sucks
also wtf whoever made majora's mask?
Other wise you save the world and people still get abducted, killed, have unfinished bisness.
No idea now
I did most of my playing it years ago
oh i see.. i understand now
hi
ya i always thought about that.. funny that they implement it
:(
They made mm so you could just do it all
:*(
:'(
Hi pinkiepie
hi :D
heya pinkiepie
hi
Don't be so melodramatic.
Hi all!
haha ye i oust kiding a litle bit :)
;)
i'm ticked cause this jerk dumori told me massive spoilers
about a game i already thought i beat
completely
Bah
lols
_D
:D
have to go se ya
alright take care
Just told you that unless you do all the quests in the 3 days they aren't done.
And that's it
It's a bitch to do though
As if you slip up you have to start all over...
well of course
And you need to juggle time slot
ceiling|Dumori is meant to be my AFK name...
"Pinkie Pie, who appears mostly talentless but who is actually a demon of chaos who can alter reality itself merely through force of will."
Why am I still active
it's stupidly slow but you got to work stupidly fast? that's something
cause i stood still and you came back
It's normal speed but each game day is twice as long so you can do more
well ya i know
but i mean the wait time is so long
for all the time to be done
but if anyone can do it i can too lol
You need to warp around slot
A lot
Ie start x do y go back to x
well i'll plan that out myself
i don't want a walkthrough
Bah the quest log is good for that
Also you need to fit the bosses in.
ya i know
But deity mask = EASY as pie
:| ya
You have to do the quests the cheap ways if you can
obviously lol
06,15Ahhh, finally some food. <3
I wonder if any pony has recorded said run
i've been around games enough to know what it's probably like
06,15Talking speed runs?
i just wish i had a controller that i could probably do said challenge with.. it's looking like i'm gonna need to use an emulator if that's even a valid option
sort of.. it basically is but it's a challenge to do lots of stuff in a short amount of time
a specific set amount of time
which is very fast apparently
06,15Hmmm, in what game?
06,15I've tried to do a Super Metroid speed run, but I couldn't get closer than 20 minutes to the record. :P
majora's mask
glad i got to play super metroid as a kid.. that game has alot to teach about the importance of atmosphere
06,15Yeah. It taught me a lot about gameplay, also. Super Metroid is a work of platforming art.
ya it was a SUPER great game
no pun intended
It's the do everything in the 3 days challenge
06,15It's like they put the skill-based short cuts in there on purpose, too.
All the side quests and the main quest. You have to use the reversed song of time (for parts at least)
06,15Ahhh, I've heard about that.
It's my ultimate goal withy next play though
GC emulated version though as my n64 is now long dead
06,15I don't have my N64 anymore, kinda regret getting rid of it.
I have it I think
It's just dead
my nes still works though
lol
kinda
The poor thing burnt out
06,15N64 just had unfortunately weak controllers.
Think we had a powersurge and it blow it
my n64 works fine though i think.. it's just the poor controllers that are not perfect
06,15Every single one of them got problems with the analog stick, it was getting annoying. :P
Yeah our n64 died 08-09
And it was used reguarly up till then
Those damn rare ware games
So so much fun
i never actually owned a snes.. i played it at my sisters house lol
Still has his mega drive
but i still got to play zelda a link to the past, super metroid and super mario world
RustedDrone: Pinkie Pie is the true god of Equestria.
=s
and a little of mario paint.. that bug swatting game was srs bsns
06,15I wish I had the Zelda collection for GC
Agreed
06,15I only have the OoT/Master's Quest disc
She's basically Haruhi Suzumiya. =s
Ah
This is just her reality.
I have the whole set
Was well worth keeping
quit bragging
:P
06,15Yeah, it wasn't released in stores here, though
i'm jk though
06,15You had to be a Club Nintendo member and enter some kind of lottery
Ah lame
Pal got it with the GC at one point
06,15Eh, eventually I'll find one :P
With double dash.
06,15Oh okay... well I already had a GC, so that wouldn't have helped much
Totally the mario cart game was the add on there
Haruhi Suzumiya?
hmmm brb google
06,15but then I guess it was available in stores here, since I'm in PAL territory :P
And the 6 Zelda games one disc the reall selling point
X3
too bad i don't have some of these golden oldies http://www.gadgetlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NES-cartridge-USB-external-hdd-450x298.jpg
I had dia katana first ed cart printing
Sold it for a fuck tonne
i had to make a pun lol
That storyline sounds quite cool o_o
:)
Such a collectable cart
For some reason
I mean it's was a SHIT game
a cartridge or 2 of mine had a hole in it.. still worked lol
a sizeable hole at that
=s
Lol
06,15Oh wow, what heresy, destroying a Zelda cartridge :P
06,15I didn't like Zelda 2
nah it was like snake rattle 'n roll or something
we didn't mean to destroy it lol
also it still played so eh
06,15Dammit, now I feel like playing Ocarina of Time :(
play snake rattle 'n roll and a winner can be you
06,15Time to get the GC out from the closet.
nah it's a nes game
unless.. you're saying you don't want to be a winner
06,15I mean for me, to play some Zelda :P
06,15...actually I think I'd rather play Wind Waker
this can't be!
i think i'd rather play snake waker
06,15I think I'd rather play Wind Eater
>.>..... >.>...... <.<......
i think i'd rather play wind shielder
MetalGear Zelda: Wind Eater
06,15I'd play that.
Or The Legend of MetalGear
Not sure
Both are cool names
06,15I like Metal Gear Zelda, because it implies Zelda is the new Metal Gear.
Occarina of libity
X3
06,15but yeah, going AFK a bit, I haven't played any Zelda in a long time...
the legend of metal gear: a winner is you
actually
the legend of metal gear: a windwaker is you
the legend of simulators: the horrible of seasons

07,1 hugs Silvermane more
although mostly because I need to glomp you at least every day or two.
8rawr
although you got the cu-EEP
morning
07,1 oh geez that yellow... I can't read that! why did you pick yellow :(
hey Fluttershy`... umm... it's not how it looks?
06,15lol
/me panics
/me Hugs everypony
9Um um that better?
hey Luna
07,1 lots better
12What about this?
dat lime green text
07,1 is having a white background in her irc client
06,15I like that, whatever it is
Hi DashWithRainbows. Let's go eat, huh?
2ahhh
12oops
12blue
12I like blue but...
12>>; <<; it's so dark
Had some luna some.
talk to me
The irc sever it's self got laggy
07,1 nope.. it was mibbit
Due to the disconnect connect spam
12mibbit is slow?
07,1 yep
12Or you talking about what happened during the marathon?
talk to me mon
06,15That might have just been your client, Dumori
14c7!!!!
Oh yeah the massive lagg was mibbit no lie
14-hugs-
Nah it wasn't
07,1 server admins are looking into alternatives... more info SOON!
12There aren't too many good alts out there sadly...
06,15http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/165/535/40435%20-%20Sweetie_Belle%20meme%20soon.jpg
07,1 alts?
Not at all.
Alternatives
For mibbit
6*hugs*
6^^
Bar saying if you can use an IRC client do it
14how are you? :3
07,1 it was just a shame... what i'm most upset about was.. we had a test-stream before and only 200 ponies showed up... we had fridaynight stream and 1200+ ponies showed up
6Good,you? ^^
test stream? when was that?
14I'm fine
07,1 a stream to test stability and the likes
12gah... the whole thing with the s2 premiere was a nightmare ;___;
6Btw,how come it shows you as away even though you just spoke? I noticed it with DSD yesterday too..
Yeah
So many people in chat
i think you mean a learning experience!
i was worried i wouldnt be anle to watch season 2 live
06,15Was the test stream announced on EqD?
06,15I'm pretty sure it was.
07,1 yep
14o.O
14That's weird
Bmn stream was on MLP wiki too
hello everybrony!!!
6Yeah.
I remember the premier being laggy at first, but it got better later.
Yeah
Maybe that was only in the Fluttershy room...
It was better than the alts after it delagged
6I can't put that I'm away o.o
how is everybrony today?
12Luna yfw my original plan was to have yellow text with a pink background >>
06,15Yeah, it didn't take that long for it to get sorted out, and the repeat was very nice.
07,1 the fluttershy room was great :)
Sleepy and a tree of the pine type
12<3 Oh yes. Fluttershy room was awesome
@Fluttershy` that would be so hard to read!
WAT
RP is Mod?
06,15Ohay Dermathil
07,1 that's because he's a mod
07,1 and so is flutter ;)
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
...Even though we had to watch fluttershy's brain get hacked
6Anyways.. o.o
/me isn't a mod :(
atleast she was capable of actually not falling for discords trap
/me has to start thinking of sending another application in.
12lol @ Dermathil
he had to cheat...
/me blames his gmail being retarded
(1st interview was a no)
6Btw,I made a new SCS with all the thus from yesterday :3
I applied in august x3
i like how discord didn't actually give a shit about the game
12I'm not sure how I became a mod
Discord and Q have so much in common...
12o-o
just did whatever he wanted anyway
Only found the reply yesterday.
12I'm like... the weirdest person... to be a mod
they both love "games"
and both cheat anyways
he didn't corrupt dash either
06,15I don't think so, Fluttershy`.
just had her pick between two loyalities
he did corrupt her by showing her the image of cloudsdale
so she's just fucking with them (or just twilight) and the game was nothing to him
12I was so sure I was going to fail during so hard XP
12fail so hard*
12during stuff
12><
My theory is they take the weird persons as mod. Why? I wasn't taken
no she was still loyal
just picked the other one
when i first saw the design of discord i was.. something.. i wouldn't say disappointed.. maybe worried in a way.. anyway it was totally not what i expected but now it's awesome
well, not weird per se, but more unusual individuals.
she didn't become disloyal technically
better than expected actually
06,15>Dermathil not being weird
that's what I JUST said RP
I meant unusual
If all the wierd people were mods, every brony who ever lived would be one.
12HOW IS MY TEXT? IS IT OKAY TO SEE?
I hope the next episode continues the awesomeness of this one... see you on Saturday ;)
ohai bronystate
/me nods
12DOES IT STAND OUT ETC?
Is BLU
DashOrCrash: that would be if the mods weren't unusual bronies
06,15Yeah, it's easy to see, Fluttershy`
is noticable...
/me squints his eyes to read.
12RobotPinkie: my name in highlight is hard to see on mibbit XP
Mibbit is meh
Even pidgin is better irc client.
12Mibbit is better than some
I use Colloquy for IRC
can't see text
black background
because I'm on a mac =D
Lol
hey mac what you in for?
06,15Oh yeah, the light background
12I would use light blue if Silver didn't already have it ;___; I love light green as well
12light green is my fave
Colloquy is on my phone
colour text on IRC is soo 1999
anyway
;/
07,1 lol
X3
lol
Is needed fir modding. I guess
no it's not
they have the @
MantisToboggan, not in every client.
but it's not like this channel is srs business so whatever. just kinda annoying imo
On mibbit with 599 plus
06,15It's just so it's easy to see warning messages and important things from mods.
07,1 nope.. our new mods don't have a @
It is
I don't see the @ in Mibbit, for example.
07,1 nor a star
This is the first time I've heard of an @
12Luna: me and RP just have kick powers
12Dari just gave us kick powers for nao ;__; no hop or op
07,1 that's cause this server does not allow hops
12oh dear
07,1 just do your best ;)
/me still thinks that he deserves moar than just mere viewer due to being around for so long.....
12;___;
06,15Ah okay.
Hops are fun
They make good beer
14:O
XD
14can I see it?
xD
12hahaha
12ha
12ha
12ha
12ha
don't you spam now...
12I was scared to type any more >>
Lakskskakakx
Sjahdgagshd
Thats real spam
well, I'm gonna get coffee
but afterwords...
06,15Yeah don't make me break my cannon out, Fluttershy` :P
/me does not to drink your mere coffee
should I play Minecraft or Civ 5?
I'd need coffee too. I'm burned out after the marathon and the streaming yesterday
12RobotPinkie: I call it a kick hammer
Borg
/me wonders if perma-voice exists on this server.
I just woke up, so I really need the coffee.
9I give up. I don't see NewDCD for now and I love green so much I must give in ;___;
06,15I'd prefer to call it my Rider Kick, Fluttershy`
the stream yesterday was awesome!
well, not NEED, just WANT
I think Solarstorm Dermathil
wat? Solarstorm has permavoice?
the stream was indeed awesome
So
No
07it was?
yup
06,15>mfw I talk about using my Rider Kick on Fluttershy`, and suddenly she has DCD colors
07,1 I passed out saturday in the afternoon
better than having to watch BMN euroshow
Auto complete is a dick
9..... sorry.... ;____________________; I would use yellow
Hipster_Brony has yellow already<
We did watch BMN euroshow... well half of it
06,15lol I didn't mean like that
Though I hasn't seen him in so darn long
06,15I meant he loves Kamen Rider, Fluttershy` :P
Mods need distinct colours
i could not stand to watch those terrbile movies for one second..
9OH
9lol
We did watch the MLP movie though...
/me hugs Fluttershy`
14LOOOOL
i know but i didnt want to rewatch them...
/me 9hugs Luna back "awww you okay?"
6:D
/me has been around since before RainBroDash was a mod and is still a normal viewer. He pulls monies out and start to think of how much to "lobby" for permavoice.
even then on BMN i just muted MLP movie
/me meows at Luna
9>>;
9<<;
This needs more flute...é
X3
/me 9has only been around since... a little over two weeks ago.
Derm stop being butthurt :p
Been here from 2nd night
Missed 3
Lurks like a shadow
Haven't noticed you much then Dumori since that's when I first showed up.
would of been on longer earlier today but i wanted some sleep after party...
But I haven't missed a single one and was at all the special events.
07,1 it does not matter how much you've been around or not...
I lurked a lot early
We know
14o.o
9I'm so clueless though ;_______;
14I remember he said he had a hockey stick
you will learn in time Fluttershy`
14that he used to hit his parents with
14if he wa spissed off
9I'm always asking other mods for help because I'm so clueless >_<
6:O
14and they came in his room
6Poor people xD
07,1 indeed give it time
Wait is Fluttershy` pre leverage?
time... Q_Q
xD
06,15What matters is how pretty you are, and also if you wear jeans or khakis.
9pre leverage?
9Khakis!
6Come to think of it I kinda remember something like that
07,1 oh dear..leverage...
/me hides
>jeans...
leverage is BattleField-Earth
14xD
Leverage meme.
06,15Shhh! Don't give away the secret, Fluttershy`! :P
WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN LEVERAGE...
(and it goes on and on and on)
i think my finger and the backspace button fell in love.. they can't stay apart for too long
6Meh..I just came across a screenie I had uploaded some years ago,that's all :P
9what about leverage though? I'm so confused.
9Pre-leverage? What does it mean? ;___;
>implying they even try >:(
9WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?!
06,15Fluttershy` knows not of leverage, no. That's like... maybe the first night I was here?
14O: I see
06,15I think I missed most of it, though.
Leverage. A meme from Battlefield earth
I applied for mod before that...
I think
I missed battlefield earth, so I have no clue either
07,1 once again it does not matter how much you've been around.. that's only 1 part of the puzzle
I've seen the moive
6ill never know my shelf until ido this on my own xDD Hadn't seen that one for a while :P
We know luna.
Well I do all of I do
9Guess what Luna?
Pineapple
07,1 yes dear?
14LOL the shelf one
06,15Yeah, the Xyclons or whatever they're called liked to talk about having leverage over people.
9I stayed up all night again .___.
14yeah it's on the wall behind her
I was up till 4am yesterday... er... today
theres a puzzle?!?
07,1 yea.. welcome to the team Flutter..
06,15Aw, that's not good :(

6xDDD
07,1 becoming part of us is goodbye good-night sleeps
9I'm in college though, oh dear...

but i was up really late for the BMN and Saturday streams
9Yfw I've actually been rping with Silvermane all night >>
6Though it might've changed places.. :O

(Freezeframe, please make sure this is on every news source in the world)
Dermathil: All of it.

Dermathil, How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could Chuck Norris

Nobody can Chuck Norris.
/me walks away from his waifu and licks the cute couple. "You have now been blessed by the King of the Ship.
Yu broke the tongue twister.

06,15The King of Ship... sounds like a good movie.
The sixth sheik's sixth sheep is sick
/me leans against Flutter still confused by the sudden request
my face is full of daaaawww
That's the tongue twister I have to do every morning in front of a mirror for speech therapy.
/me 9hugs Luna tightly, patting her back and blushing. "Y-you can have as much time as you need... I-I'll be right here, waiting for you..."
Hey guys, whats up?
<--- Has a bit of a lisp
Well we all know how Fluttershy` got to be a mod so fast ;) ;)
Apparently, LunaShy became bronystate canon
Apparently so
07LunaShy hahah that sounds adorable
Dumori, if that were true, I'd have been one by now, with mai waifu RainBroDash
So, everybody still reeling from Ep 1?

06,15Has someone made fanart of Two as Picard yet?
06,15Twi

Oh hell yes
I think

Let me go fetch a particularly memorable one
Actually, it was an image of DisQord asking if a Jean Luck Picard was around.
06,15Oh yeah that one I've seen.
/me meows at LunaShy

I think about 100 is right
I don't blame you Fluttershy`. I blame... pomf-addiction. I wonder where that came from. Awell, i'm sure the shipper will tell me eventually.
last night when i went sleep i bet :l

Why RainBroDash?
Armor is cool.
mfw i cant read...
Wait, what arguments? Of what gameS?
Cuz this is an OC and he's a guard. :D

If I had a dollar for everyone who OC'd a guard, then I'd have 15 dollars.

Suuuure
10in Fluttershy` 's name

Alright, how about an OC who's a semi-retired guard, still in reserve but builds telescopes?
10Fluttershy bot? O.o
Just like socks
Not as common!
Theres a Fluttershy bot?

08,1but his totally trolling made me so happy
I was expecting Q
I got Q
I nerdgasmed
06,15I wasn't expecting him to act quite so much like Q
Rodman: I did too :D
06,15I did expect elements of that, but wow.
i knew that vid would happen soon
i honestly wish i had seen more Star Trek, for Q after all this talk of it
After the first episode, My Mind = Blown
Only change I would've made was doing away with the evil laugh and replace it with a humerous one
10inb4 everybody shouts at RainBroDash
Nah man, is a good laugh
I am actually downloading star trek right now because of all this talk about Q :x
He enjoys what he does, he thinks it's hilarious, why would he laugh evilly other than it being a kid's show
/me 10keeps hearing about this Q fellow, has no idea who he is...
RAINBRODASH, WATCH IT DAMMIT!
DrunkAristocrat: You won't regret it, just make sure it's The Next Generation, it's the most popular of the series. Personally I prefer Voyager, but there's more Q in TNG
08,1moo
RainBroDash: i wont yell, im asking you nicely to watch it

Diftraku: Yeah that's my plan for the future, assuming I don't have to upgrade the processor first 'cause it blows. Luckily by locking one of the cores, I was able to push the overclock a little higher than I could with three cores
Yeah
3 cores suck
Diftraku: So I have 3 settings: stock, 2 cores with 15% OC, and stock speeds with an unlocked fourth core
/me 10doesn't understand this core mumbo jumbo
10and hai Wrek
At some point, one chip manufacturer said they used broken quads to make tris
That's probably AMD
so you could unlock the 4th core with a program
05ohai
OHai Wrek
Intel didn't bother with Tri-cores IIRC

06,15Shifty eyes means you're lying!
tasty choclate muffin
chocolate*
(and tea)
I should draw a still from S2 again
too lazy to look for one
awww
10I can find you one
06,15It's good practice.
Would you?
10as long as it's from the first 6 minutes of the episode
xD it can be from the first 6 minutes
i never draw
except i drew a couple of ponies based on vectors
then i was like enough with cheating i'll try to draw "blind"
and it didn't look like a pony
:x
this story brought to you by bored irc'er
I tried drawing ponies with no reference, but that didn't work out
so now I want to practice
drawing with no reference requires you to be able to remember what it's supposed to look like and imagine it properly I guess
so you can draw by looking at your imagination
probably
I can draw a pony from the side with no reference
but that's pretty much it
10the only stills I can really get are the CMC ones from the beginning. The rest is all covered with chocolate rain, and I can imagine that just being annoying
I don't plan on drawing everything
Just the pony maybe
space pony

bah, scumbagyoutube
Hello brownies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=fHn19IgXpq8

10that was enough for a nice night
10>cans. Bottles*

Ahahaha.
Poor RainBro.

10dari, you don't know the best of it
You don't want them back.
Mods make sure everything runs smoothly
I thought all IRC networks just went with nepotism
10I was at my friend's house, her parents were away
Ive been coming here like every day for like a week so i figured why not help out?
10MFW she has a 14 year old sister, who also had friends round
...
10mfw expected that^
same here LordCelestia , mostly because of how many people came onto bronystate
10*it's all going to plan*
IMO there was not enough mods
>mfw I can now watch S2 EP1 in 1080p and DragonSoop can't
10F U

>mfw i watched the episode already and can 1080p on youtube

10but basically, unfortunately most of my friends who were there on friday night also think the same of me as you do
10so the creepy lulz ensued
Ive always wanted to kick someone and say "TO THE MOOOOON"

bit nsfw
tbh
Who doesn't like a bit of r34 every now and then to spruce up your daily routines
Gives that nice touch of WTF on it
lol
Does that guy spend his entire day drawing MLP?
I just took a bath in a lake of fire on Terraria
=(
lol
he just seems to draw ponies p much 24/7
lol
he has a webcomic too iirc, about lesbians
so I guess he draws that

That picture is always relevant
mfw looking at dA
http://i.imgur.com/VPQoD.png
It exploded overnight
Oh god
I have over 10k images in my DA inbox
Lol
lol
I watched one of the bigger MLP fangroups
I cleared mine onThursday
I wish there was an option to save all search results on DA
The pinkie getting a shower of chocolate with a sexy face
Y U DO THIS
I would download all 90k+ MLP images to my harddrive
Even if it was several hundred GB
Seriously he DOES draw ponies all day doesn't he
I think so Diftraku
I dont go on DA much
I'd draw ponies all day
Diftraku http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&feature=feedlik
if I could
Anyhoof, I had fun times logging on the EQD irc yesterday over the school shell
It exposes my shell username to public
Which is a no-no-no
I would ship Caramel with Sea Ponies all day.
If I could

lol
You wish
Well I guess if I had as big a following as him, I'd probably draw all the time too
;~;
So much art...
So much to download...
Love doing it, but being a nobody and spending all my time on it don't make me happy
Is there anything on the stream atm?
he probably gets paid for some of it
afaik he does commissions
Yeah, I assume he does
I need to draw more ponies, maybe I can get more exposure that way
i need to learn how to draw ponies
AllisZero: draw lots of ponies really well
all the time
with your name over everything
i got a good idea for a drawing but i shall never tell until i get enough skill
Eh, that's not my style really
well then stop complaining about not being popular :P
Well, being popular isn't high up there on my list
But being completely invisible sucks too
:(
well then
if it's good
I'm happy to accept the karma ¬_¬
gotta get dem meaningless points
on a website
Lol haha
I don't care much, and it's easy to find me on DA
Eyup
WHERE ARE THE PONIES
's what I mean, I need to draw them more :P
lawl
well
still way better than me
DO EET

Yeah.
lol
Well, the pony stuff, but still.
I've tried WoW a couple of times, but I never have anyone to play with
I shall draw more
yes
you should
the thing about John joseco is the rule 34 stuff/shipping
You draw well :3
i hate it so much
most of the r34 stuff he draws is pretty hilarious at least
Yeah that's not up my alley, I'm not a huge fan of rule34 on MLP
and not too graphic
but yeah
r34 and ponies is just a mindfuck /o\
Eh I don't mind funny flank shots
i hate rule 34 MLP
Good Brony = does not clop to rule 34
boohoo for you?
yes boohoo for me :D
a bloo bloo bloo
I'd totally kiss them on the forehead though, them adorable ponies
ponies are all about being cute
I wanna hug them :3

Why not?

It does, but it's a bit different
also never go onto the Futaequestria tumble page
don't take my word for it though, I read it in the ponibooru comments

So it may be by crookedtrees anyway
got everything sorted out with the server now?
"Futaequestria"

is that what I think it must be
because ohgod
Has the stream done Full Metal Jacket yet?

If you choose to go to 18analsluts.com, you kind have to know beforehand what you're getting into.

It's his wallet
Also, that's how many monitors to how many computers?
The best part of my awesome mancave is my alcantara chair.
And now I wonder how many people know what alcantara is
/me opens google
I'm sitting on my couch in my living room. >_>
Well, family living room.
It's fumb dabric
"Alcantara is a tradename given to a composite material used to cover surfaces and forms in a variety of applications."
I have to take many things into account when designing a workspace
10trollestia it's 3 monitors, two to one computer (with one shared with xbox) and one to another computer
Fapan is a very important consideration in my design
10XD
I see. Nice setup.
alcantara is basically expensive fumb dabric
10oh, and the rightmost monitor is also connected to a gamecube and n64 you can't see

What you guys need is Red Bull mixed with vodka.
2,14 dude, those drinks are awesome
2,14 the mana energy potions, that is
I just saw the videos and lol'd heartily
No...
I can't get stuff like that here in Bumfuckistan

Oh god Diftraku, don't make ponies drive me to drink
I will Flaria
It is my destiny!

Wise Apple had whiskey. It's the best one because of this.

I don't have access to any, though, so it's just going to be me staring sadly at pictures
Barrel Role Dash is funny
06,15I hate my phone's camera, such crap quality :(

10RobotPinkie so blurry XD
10<3
2,14 why....? Why do you hurt me so DCD?
/me cries
RobotPinkie do you have parkinsons or something ¬_¬
so shaky
06,15I will hug anyone who makes a comment on the game.
But, ponies can wear Power Armour.
Pony Armour
A satellite that had thus been launched into orbit is actually an Orbital Bombardment Weapons Platform and needs BM's Power Armor to dock into it to work
Zelda?
06,15Not shaky, TheDukeofFail, this camera only works well during daytime.
10Is it zelda? I can hardly see...
06,15With too little light, the shutter speed is about 2 seconds.
10looks like TP's artwork? Or I've got zelda on the brain
well ok
I can't make anything out.
meanwhile, the Earth Sphere is being overrun by thousands of abominable, monstruous enemies
It looksl ike a GC case
10or is it wind waker...
06,15Yes that's Wind Waker <3
10XD robotpinkie did you see my gamecube?

I may be a horrible photographer, but at least my hand is steady.

10ohai D_E
Hello
per flaria
you better have pokemon colloseum in that gamecube
docking with the OBWP, he takes aim at thousands of enemies in the planet below....and fires a full salvo of laser-based weaponry
06,15Indeed, I'll take better pictures during daytime
10definitely zoom in on the gamecube
Hey, how the hell do I change my color using leafchat?
Isn't that the plot of Van Buren, DCD?
06,15That's 4 swords though :(
10and that gamecube had wind waker in it I think, I was doing another playthrough of that after I did OoT again
it hits the enemies directly, piercing through them and killing them without causing any civilian casualities
10But RobotPinkie it has wind waker -in- it I think D:
06,15Oh okay, then all is forgiven
how do you like yourself that display of thousand-targets Orbital Sniping?
06,15It looks very cool, DragonSoop, but I really don't like the game so much.
10also RIP that keyboard
10it got a bit too drunk this one time, and decided to end its life in a blurred haze :S
10dashite was there, it wasn't a pretty sight
:p
Errrg, this is annoyint me
annoying*
Whats up, Denied_Existence?
Heck yeah Wild Tiger
I am using leafchat and I cant figure out how the hell to change my color
%C?
2,14 youtube needs more Z2 veritechs
06,15Did you throw up on it, DragonSoop? :P
2,14 also, DCD you silly filly :P
[xx] where x is a color value.
Whoops.
Val: Macross All Attacks Z2
Yt that
...what kind of command would that be Nittany_Tiger?
10RobotPinkie not exactly, just kinda spilt beer everywhere while on skype to my bronies watching Scott Pilgrim on BMN playing a scott pilgrim drinking game
2,14 oooohhhhhhh.....so that ship is another SDF?
What was the game?
2,14 I never realized that
Wow
Next season of Tiger and Bunny only coming out in the beginning of 2013?
Boo
06,15Ahhh okay, DragonSoop, gotcha :P
I missed Scott Pilgrim ;~;
Guess I'll have to contend with Shana S3, if it's even watchable
In chatzilla, xx changes color, but it only does it for one line of text.
/me appears
%Cxx
xx is a number.
10OH GOD ITS GRIMGALLOP EVERYPONY RUN

Yeah sure Flaria, sure you're a girl...
10god I love it when bjornfort's in town
06,15My android phone is so old, it uses an Intel 4004 processor
At this point I'm just messing with pronouns to mess with DCD.
I have been sleeping most of the day. I go back to sleep after watching church, and I couldn't stay awake.
06,15Okay just one more: My android phone is so old, the only input option is punch cards
RobotPinkie, be careful with those 0's, might lose that processor otherwise
I just discovered the friendshipismagic forums.
Okay, so... are the mods sleeping, or what?
/me snores
Mods are asleep. Post ponies.
its obvious
they are sleep posting
10Mods are asleep, type in colours

10MFW dashite has still only done that 2 times since the server change
2,14 ah, dari. I should have know
:p
10Dashite, how does it feel that you can't do it without getting autokicked anymore? XD
2,14 known, even
06,15Colors are for mods, btw :P
RBD, you mean even when I have warnings left? :p
10I swear you have none now?
10I've seen you do it twice :3
RP that is an intersting color combo >_<
06,15lol enough with gratuitous kicking though.
None now of course, but I got kicked there for the second warning. :p
06,15It looks bad on your client, Sumica?
10Teal Test uno
10Teal Test deux
10Teal Test five
pink and gray have bad contrast.
^
I just have to highlight to see it.
I turned colours off because I couldn't see gray.
10yeah I was just making sure it was 3 warnings -> kick, dashite
06,15This is supposed to be dark purple, Sumica
just found a austin powers movie on tv
06,15Weird.
10dark purple on white?
fuckyeah.jpg
06,15On light gray, RinBarDosh
perhaps it's just Xchat then.
10meh, white, light gray
10:3
10but yeah that's what it looks like to us mibbit commoners
or it looks pink with a gray BG.
RBD, why are you still on mibbit?
I reserve the right to break awful looking color combos :P
06,15Yeah xchat does have weird default colors, Sumica
10dashite, because easiness. I have mIRC and I'm not exactly a scrub, but easiness.
Ah
06,15I'd recommend increasing the brightness of dark gray and light gray, or you won't be able to read Val's text either, really.
I see vals just fine
Or turn off colours.
2,14 that's cause I 1337
06,15Weird, I didn't
10valthejean lolnope
06,15In any case this should look fine on most clients
Turning off colours for the win!
then again vals bg is a light gray with dark blue text to me.
Pinkies's color looks pretty baws to me
10it's dark gray to me
10^
2,14 yeah, it's meant to be dark gray
10yeah, like dari's, but not
it is dark grey to me too
It's dark gray.
06,15Thanks, Edward_Newgate <3
<333
06,15I like these colors :P
0kids these days with your fancy text colours...
kids these days with there book of faces....
Lets see what it looks like over here.
06,15Haha, I did actually ask if I could keep normal text, but I was convinced not to. :P
The other mods would bully you
2,14 yes. Yes we would
10well the whole point of having colours is because when we need to say important things, we need to be heard
06,15Not really, but mods have color so it's easier to spot and read.
ok that is more ledgable now.
2,14 I LIEK PONIEZ
you say important things too RBD?
06,15Yes, what RinBarDosh said :P
10loonope Apokalipse
10lol*
Okay, just checking :p
10but yeah, obviously it is used and taken as a status symbol a lot, rightly so tbh :P
06,15We just might potentially say something important... sometime in the distant future.
then again, I can just set all colors in clientside to the same :P
10I definitely said something important this one time
just wondering if anyone is reading a fanfic right now?
06,15at band camp, RinBarDosh? :P
nooooo >_> <_<
10Diftraku it's mainly for the masses ofc
10and RobotPinkie definitely
Ee-yup
o-o
/me is the masses, and cba to enable colours.
10I wonder if this will spam dari with notifications..
it might if he has dari aset as an extra word to search for.
3Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari Dari
10MFW it doesn't matter, since people just spam dari anyway
2,14 >implying he's even online to hear them
10ohwell.tiff
10valthjean.. but he is
10whether he's afk or not is a different matter
2,14 :p
Dari is always here even when he is not unless he is not here then he's not.
10also nice name Apokalipse
10thanks sumica
thank you
seemed relevant
what with that one pony episode you haven't seen
06,15I'm considering playing some more Wind Waker...
10ChocolateRainBroDash I've seen that far into it
oh yeah, I remember
10whole music library on reandom, y u so play bad music only
lol
perhaps I should call my self "Q"
I know how you feel...
I got pony music only on the playlist
so much awesome so far
10this is ridiculous
It doesn't help that of the 1200 songs that I have I only listen to about... 80
10so much awesome on my phone's music library, and it's dodging the awesome like a giant bastard
lol
10THANK YOU. It picked something good
/me 10is at peace with the world
I have 5,4k songs on my winamp library
I cba to put all songs on the play list
Sound right around what I have Diftraku, I think my full playlist is 12days.
Sumica killed chat!
10http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMny1jIfKU4 Is the song that came on, just for people's listening pleasures, and to un-kill chat
/me gets hit on the head with a newspaper
It's my specal talent.
10that's the song that came on, for people's listening pleasure and to un-kill the chat :3
3Orly Sumica? What is your cutiemark then?
a blank expressionless face ofcorse.
10>even talking /about/ sumica kills the chat

I could just go banish my self to work again.
Sumica, my whole library that's in Winamp: 15 days 19 hours 24 minutes and 57 seconds, 5405 items
10this PC only has 80 hours
Feh i dont want to work tonight >_< I know it's going to be a huge boreing fundraser party.

Call in sick and say you have P.O.N.Y.

And the only cure is more pony

/me hugs Diftraku
:P
10MFW one of many pictures of me drunk that I've just noticed were put up on facebook contains me pulling a 'dat ass' face. And I think it was my friend's younger sister that I was doing it at >.>
Post ponys on the projecters in the middle of there dinner.
10god help me and keep the alcohol away from me
RinBarDosh: can i see it?

Anyone want to do my maths homework for me?
Liarjack <3
2,14 I'll do it Dari! And I totally wont purposefully suck at it!
2,14 <.< >.>
What kinda math, Dari? >.>
Maths maths.
:P
10dari what module?
10assuming C1 S1 or M1?
C1
Nice and simple. :P
10i got 90-something percent
10:D
1 + 1 = 2.
There you go.
You get an A* overall?
10wait, which textbook do you use?
10and nah lol
10not at all
10I got 2 marks off a B
10XD
Oh.
06,15Not sure what C1 is, because I come from a real country.
06,15:P
'Understanding Pure Mathematics'
Sounds like Number Theory.
10ours is Heinemann modular mathematics - C1
10I still have it
This homework's on quadratics anyway.
10want a hand? :P
Well you could do it for me.
:P
10ahaha, well that depends how long it is
s = e mod x. :p
I'll drop a question in here if I get stuck. Heheheh.
10alrightypoo
Name your variables pony names, and if you get in trouble for that, say that "Well, a variable can have any name." because it's true.
10YFW I can't remember how to complete the square
Lawl
10I think I can
10it /was/ a while ago
I'd be disappoint if you'd forgotten the formula for solving quadratics.
Spike/Rarity, Fluttershy/BM, Twilight/Trixie, Applejack/Rainbow, Pinkie/Luna...
Some of my Fave Pairings, One for each main cast...
Pfft, that's what google is for.
10oh yeah I know that one
I know it by heart.
goddammit, 4th time I've seen the first ep
Still can't get enough
10completing the square is balls though, you only need it if it's a question which is designed to be solved by completing the square
Heheheh.
10Diftraku YFW you've already seen it 4 more times than me
I hate fan pairings. but I also love them
I'll just watch it once more...
You still haven't seen S2E1?
Yeah, I also like a bit of Twilight/Luna
Nittany_Tiger: (-Fluttershy +- radical( Fluttershy^2 - (4 * Applejack * Rarity) ) ) / (2 * Applejack)
and PinkiePie: How is Spike/Rarity a fan pairing?
Yes.
That math...
10no I haven't N_T
10xD
I could do
Spike has a crush on Rarity, so it is suggested in the show...
10natelyn what if applejack = 0>
10?*
06,15Rainbow-Dash, completing the square is useful to see how the formula is derived.
/me 10prepares chat for implosion
Applejack(Twilight_Sparkle)^2 + Rarity(Twilight_Sparkle) + Fluttershy = 0.
06,15lol wrong name
06,15RainBroDash :P
10:L
/me hugs Nittany_Tiger
10but in silly AS maths, it's menial
/me hugs back.
I wish I had math classes left, so I could do that
Maybe I will in physics.
06,15I think it's important to go through it and understand it, but more than that? No, I guess that's pretty pointless.
I could do it in my codes.
Meh, I only see that working one way
Whats that?
10guess who gets the award for ruining what could have been an ok picture?

Well, PinkiePie: The Mane 6 will live forever, Spike wont... he'll age
so it will work...
*could
lol
Awesomeshy: Luna and Celestia were the elements, and they lived for a thousand years, and still are living... now the mane 6 have the elements, Celestia and Luna could begin to age again, and the Mane 6 would live forever, or until they pass the elements to new persons...
CTCB: they weren't the actual elements, they used the elements
even the mane 6 aren't the actual elements
they're just represent the spirits of the elements of harmony
why am i even arguing this I feel silly
Awesomeshy: Yes, thats what I mean, they use the elements, they are part of them... the Spirits...
I didn;t think this was an arguement...
I thought it was a discussion...
you know what I mean
I found some nacho cheese but it has no flavor and makes my mouth sad.
also, just because they represent the spirits of the elements of harmony doesn't mean they're like
never had nacho cheese...
i don't know what that is
celestia and luna have such a long lifespan because of their race
but cheese is p cool
:C
T.T
they're p much the closest things to gods in the show
First time I had nacho cheese
I guess I was 11 or so. My dad took me to a gas station that has one of those uber food courts, and they had hot-dogs with chilli and nacho cheese
Felt like rape in my mouth
mfw you somehow know what rape in the mouth feels like :3
It's pretty obvious they should change the name to Pinkie Pie no yuutsu. ;x
:o
:O

We've never seen a black hole, but we know what they are like!
AllisZero, we have seen many of them
densetsu no yuusha no Pinkie Pie
I think I'm beginning to understand what it feels like.
They're called women's handbags
10Alliszero I'm sure you know what rape in the mouth tastes like ;)
10also mfw flashbacks from the rerapening...
>_>
06,15Yeah, that's a bit different, because the only thing that comes out of a black hole is bose-einstein condensate.

Meh, 22 minute episodes.

PinkiePie: you really do not want to know what 'oro' means...
adverts ruin everything
BBC4lyf
the nonadvert 1080p version is pure win
06,15They need to have 45 minute episodes, and in the end House will turn out to have been right all along.

10BBC is the only bearable channel on uk tv
10I can't stand adverts in general
06,15What about Dave, RainBroDash?

>mfw my country's government wants to force all ISPs to install government-issued spyware to spy on everything people does with their internet without a warrant.

Nittany_Tiger: Canada

Hello, Stomper, :)
I hate when countries have metered internet bw
Hiya FreezeFrame
when did Stomper get here
[22:37:24] Stomper has joined #ponychat
And I've wanted to move their at times because of our crappy piracy laws and such.
oh
Awesomeshy: ^^
oh I see it now
Quote from a webpage speaking about it: "The government is set to ram through a new set of electronic surveillance laws that will allow authorities to access private information of any Canadian, at any time, without a warrant. You'll be forced to pay for this online spying scheme."
ok, :)
And ones to come.
oh hey it doenst get bold when you say my name :/
I know the perfect way to counter that
I gots a dediiii!
:DDd
INB4 Anonymous attack the Canadian government
All citizens have the ability to spy on the government at anytime they want to
At least they have arrested anyone in the US yet for PS3 modding.
ovh
Dermathil, isn't the most recent thing just about warrant-less information requests from ISPs?
Stomper: you're doin' it wrong
france
Dashite: http://openmedia.ca/educate
ovh is iffy
huh?
:3 Its only the biggest server company
/me puts on the foilhat before clicking that link
Yeah, I think that's they one they've been talking about recently.
It's about "lawful access"
What's this I hear about cardgames on pony-cycles?
I'm back.
Finnish ISPs have those blocklists installed
You can bypass them by using a non-ISP DNS
Ponyraku, the ISPs own the hardware for the interweb in the country and can throttle the interwebs here at anytime they want.
That sucks arse
I think it's the same here.
The two main ISPs have basically a biopoly.
We have unmetered internet here, just speedcapped based on how much you pay
What sucks more is that the only ISPs that don't throttle are smaller regional ISPs
Ive had servers at ovh and friends at ovh
its iffy
There's at least 2 major ones that cover the whole country: Elisa and Sonera
:x
http://i.imgur.com/9bTVL.png
Then there's smaller ones with limited availability
Whats wrong with it?
Dashite, don't forget that the CRTC has put a law that forces those smaller ISPs to limit the internet to 300GB/month
Can't wait to see all of them being sued to shit
bad service
AllisZero, deep packet inspection is a big no no
What? No, they don't.
bad servers
yes they did
is what ive heard
the law passed
but give it a try maybe your experience will be better
Well :3 Ill comment on that when iv had mine for a while
They weren't limited to 300GB by law.
Why are they even doing it?
have you tried the kimsufi servers?
They were limited by what the ISPs they were leasing the lines from charged them.
Are they running out of countrywide bandwidth?
$21/mo for 1TB HDD 2GB RAM, and a 2.44GHz proc
its not the best
but its great for the price
WUT
I wanted to start an ARM based budget server company
lol
$10/month gets you a mini arm based box.
10if trixie doesn't win
dari, could you get a link with those updates as well?
ohh
10this is a farce
Ponyraku: no. The big ones are in the equivalent of a monopoly for the hardware
maybe you can help me real quick
just 1 question
k
So they saw their money flowing out through those smaller ISPS
do you know how to limit the disk quotas of certain users?
Dermathil, that sucks arse
I am looking to do a dropbox kind of thing
the CRTC took the side of the big ones and forced the smaller ones to put a cap.
dddddd
twilight best
That's not what happened!
and have a mapped drive on the users' comp, and it limits their disk space
that would be implated into the system
Lol corporate greed.
into the server?
i dont know that sorry
:/
The CRTC did side with Bell/Rogers, but they didn't mandate a cap!
oh
Dashite, last news articles I read said they did
I guess the only way to escape it is to live in a socialist/communist govt. (maybe)
The fight earlier this year was about usage based billing.
Afaik, it's always been based on the speed you want in Finland
3g has been different
Only way to escape draconic restrictions on what you can and can't do?
It started mainly per usage but now uses per speed billing
Yeah, good luck getting that in a socialist government.
One w/o corporate corruption.
But then you have govt. corruption.
We did have per speed billing about 4 years ago. The big ISPs started putting caps back in around that time.
Anarchy time!
Fun fact
Internet is listed as a human right in Finland
I recall reading that actually.
The ISPs must provide at least a 1mb internet to everyone who wants it
I wonder if the US will do that eventually.
They did it with telephones.

With a Panoramic Cockpit and G-Force simulation seat

We survived the summer, after all.
You get used to it. Go read some fanfic or something.

FFFFFFF I can't please everypony..
Mwahahahahaha
Hey guys, did you hear about that satellite coming towards earth?
Eyup
Nope. Tell us please?
ee-yup
How's that going?
Theres like a 6.5 ton satellite coming for the earth and we dont know where its gonna land
I heard.
until september 24 or later
Could crash ANY DAY?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=X-QDux8_w0k
Any day around Sep 24
Come on, scientists can do better than that
Its moving at 5 MILES PER SECOND
thats kinda fast...
Well
At that speed
It's going to burn on re-entry
they considered that
but
NASA confirmed that there are 26 components of the satellite that will most likely survive the burning
DAAAANGER ZONE
So why not intercept it with a missile like that last one?
Rainbow-Dash....
FUCK YEAH
Idk,
This ones going too fasty
*fast
5 miles a second? youll need a pretty fast rocket
Errr
and they dont know where it's going to enter our atmosphere. not until 2 hours before it hits
Wow, 5 miles a second, I heard that right?
You just need to calculate the angle, if its orbit is somewhat stable
Lots of flak. :p
Well thats a problem
5 (miles per second) = 18 000 mph
It;s not stable. Like I said, we don't know where it will enter. If it enters over antarctica or something we wont be able to get to it in time
mach 1 = 761.207051 mph
So yeah.. pretty effing fast..
It's basically barelling through space uncontrollably
We should have like rainbow dash save us or something
Assuming you need to match the speed
You'd need to go over Mach 23
I don't think even her sonic rainboom would match the speed LordCelestia.
You dare disagree with me?
lol just kidding
I do. >:|
but no, her sonic rainboom can top everything
I challenge you.. to a duel!
If we assume a sonic rainboom occurs at the same speed as a sonic boom
Trollestia, say "umad" to her
No, she's done well.
ALRIGHT
Then no, RBD will not be able to match the speed
Magic beats royalty I win.
/me uses MOON CANNON on Trollight Sparkle. Fatality.
FFFF
I win ^^
Since the satellite is moving at Mach 24 and Dash is moving at Mach 1
You still have much to learn, dont worry *teleports trollight back to earth*
But...
Thank you very much.
Oh. well idk
If you don't need to match the speed, just intercept it
You could just missile it
maybe dashs rainboom has like a 500 mach force behind it
:D
And we're assuming the satellite won't be slowed down by the friction caused by the athmosphere
Alright ill tell you what we'll do
Someone should do a comic or cartoon of Past Sins.
Whoops.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOlbLbPLsYU&feature=related
Had my chat scrolled up.
Trollight, i am Magic Royalty so that makes it 20.5 percent better
Dammit Seth, stop forgetting the post titles
:|
We'll take rainbow dash and clone her 500 times. Then we'll have them make 500 sonic rainbooms in space and together their force will be 500 machs of pure energy blasting the fucker to smithereens.

Pinkamena Pie.
I half expected her to actually get her straight mane back, tbh

It's not Pinkamena. Pinkamena implies deflated mane.

oh lol

Runescape.
No way dude? I still play that occasionally!

Lets put it this way: if you like Fallout and want to read fan fics, read that
i like the premise of fallout
but didnt really like fallout 3
Back from Circle of Friends.
I highly recommend reading FO:E

Should recolour all DJ Pon3 pictures with her eyes as colours other than red.
Hey, has anyone seen Luna since earlier/
?
The reactions would be great.
I sent my application form back but she hasnt been on here since earlier
I actually like vinyl with red eyes
As do I.
It'd just be funny with all the people saying "OMFG U RERTRED SHE GT READ IES"
As am I. wait...
Then you say "Nope, the eyes are whatever colour you want them to be".
And they rage.
Lulz ensue.
Then you say "Lern 2 speel"
Dari's trollin'
Again.
What if...
You are colour blind
HNNNNG
TOO ADORABLE
Diftraku: "She's always had grey eyes to me!"

Colours are so overrated.
I mean, just look at the mane cast. No colours anymore!

danke
Oh look
and we all know pony os more important that OS files
Oh lawl, suggestion list looks great xD
Trixie, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, Big Mac bedroom eyes
Lolo
oh big mac X3
I don't know which is more freakier: the actual video
or the fact that it's in 1080p
Lol
x3
wait it's drawn by our RobotPinkie? or another
mass produced robot pinkies
Today feels like a "Silva Hound - Nightmare Moon" day
I am listening to the deus ex soundtrack
sweet, sweet wav files -.-
19% though back upaprently
still copying pony
why do I have 60gb of pony
lol
if not more
I dare not even think how much I have
thats quite a lot
do say I dont save many images
WTF is in my pony folder
I have the episodes and I have that 26k image torrent that was going around
but
and I have pony swag I guess
but yeah
other than that I am a terrible brony :(
I have all the episodes 3 times
x3
720p mp4
1080p mkv
and 720 avi
:z
lol
why
the hell
would you have 3 copies
I have them in the form they are in from the /pony/ torrent.
that's just insane ;\
Mostly 1080p .mkv
well I have 1080 .mvk for my PC
the 720 avi and colour fixed itunes rips
that I transcoded back in to mp4 for my iPhone
I need to clean out D:
I'm backing up files I have already coppyed acress to K
I should wear my pirate shirt today.
YARRR
um
yeah I have MLP 4 times
x3
you're insane
cos Itune coppyed them from transcode in to it's lib folder too
X3
yeah I can totlay get rid of 2 copies tough
iTunes is a pos
^
iTunes is EPIC
lolno
(for all the wrong reasons)
Ah.
also its EULA says I can't use it to make nukes
HOW?!
really
how
lol
also bioweapons
and chemical ones
still HOW
that's probably apple's default EULA language tbh
That sucks... I always wanted to make one with iTunes
maybe Mac OS has it too
which makes more sense
Easy Dumori,
not allowed to use Mac OS to help design weapons
Your not allowed to use it to view content on how to make them!
yeah I'm temped to make a nuke with itunes in it
Such as the DIY nuclear reactor
lol
Dumori
missile playing pony tunes
as it goes
Fun fact: any EULA that is not in finnish is not legally binding contract in Finland
last thing anyone hears before it goes off is "WINTER WRAP UP"
Got to love the law here
kindo' the wrong order
/me moves to finland
So, because WoW only has an english EULA
that cinches it x3
CAUSE TOMORROW SPRING IS HERE *nuclear rainboom*
I'm binded by it in any way
(hence Microsoft has almost all EULAs in finnish these days)
damn I'm a foal
I poored boiling water over my had earlyer
was fun

No.

I have no idea what big o is
as I'm yet to test if I've fixed the random joining

06,15Discord knows everything, and he did inform us about who best pony is...
ah but he said that twilight was the most powerful
Best pony is DJ pony
he just likes pinkie pie because she's nuts
06,15His motivations don't matter!
>most powerful and elusive element
!= best pony
Ok I need sleep I just forgot MY gender
yes it does >:|
Nope.
Dash is best pony.
d
twilight obviously best
Hi bronystate
Hi

06,15I'll have to agree with Dari here, what Discord means is "wtf is the opposite of magic?"
dari the troll strikes again

06,15Indeed!
>mfw rings no bell
/me brohoofs Dumori
OH

/me facehoofs as he recognizes the guy in the pictures
06,15Stephen Fry had a show with Hugh Laurie way back
x3
06,15A Bit of Fry and Laurie
also Black Adder
06,15It's one of the things I watched on BBC to learn English, lololol
oooh, so THAT'S where I remember this guy. Bones.
x3
I was raised in the UK
and my lingisic Knowledge is shit
You ONLY remember Fry from Bones?
Poor.
I know pidgin German and Japanese
at best
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fry

06,15I learned English from... uh... being really weird as a kid.
leant japanese form that
Dumori: he's recurring Guest star in Bones. That'S where I remember him
also goign there as 5
lol
06,15I was kinda obsessive about learning Japanese for a while, too.
06,15but books on languages are expensive...
lol
/me is taking classes on it.
06,15Taking Japanese formally next year.
I spent a while in japan as a wee boy
when I was 5
been obessed with it from then on
06,15...there's a debate?
wait
Well, argument.
what debate
we where talking about knowing japanese
06,15Whatever you like best, lawl.
^
06,15I know a fair bit, I guess. Couple of hundred kanji, obviously both kana alphabets.
06,15Not nearly enough to read a newspaper, though.
I can install programs properly. That's it.
I'd love to learn Vietnamese or Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese)
Oh hey I too studied Japanese for six months
Of course, the latter would mean I'd be able to figure out what my roommate is saying on the phone >.>
I can't read it or speak it well
I can understand it spoken
I leanr basic japanese as 5
/me doesn't know squat about Japanese language.
didn't learn to read it though
06,15I can't understand it that well spoken, really, though it depends on the complexity.
I can't remember much of it though...
/me knows how to count to ten in japanese... barely
/me knows very, very little.
06,15If someone's talking about getting food or what they're gonna do this weekend, then I can follow it :P
/me is at a small college that has a whole lot of international students, primarily from Vietnam and the PRC
Knows how to ask a lass out in it curedly x3
I want to learn, partly for the language itself.
crudly
/me uderstands basic insults in Japanese
I do enjoy the language tbh
Someone here studies Japanese?
I'm going to.
nope I might though
one of my best mates does
It's actually quite fun language to study, if somewhat dificult
