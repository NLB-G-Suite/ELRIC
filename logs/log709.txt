Plastic surgery is the old-fashioned way?
and sometimes you are bitch? is it possibru to say that?
Saturn: not really. This is a special case because the show he was dubbing was awful, but other shows he's done? They were at least competent, and he intentionally made the dubs shitty.
damn it time skips
ouch
Saturn: and now not only is he working on "Grave of the Fireflies", he's doing "Mawaru Penguindrum" as well which is...no. just no.

The idea here is that the Mayan Calander's 5th age runs out on December 21st 2012, and this is somehow fortelling the end of the world.
04That's me and my nephew and niece, basically
why are there subtitles for this?

05,15Personally I can't wait until December 21st 2012. It's going to be awesome

lols
DOOOohh
13oh and if you're wondering, emmerich has a fixation on wisconsin cause he's from there
WUT
seems legit
except most of the riffs on the older movies are bad.
Close enough.
OH NO THE SHIP IS FALLING.
dont die shasha
13he was also in stargate sg1's later seasons
WAAAAAAHHHHT
15 = 18
lol
Well I always said that Wisconsin was going south with all of those backwards politics, but did they listen? NOOOOOOO....
"DAH"
da
"DAAAHHH"
14But I had to go to see my counselor and then to Wal-Mart, instead. >:C
Wisconsin is the south pole now? Now.... I just can't picture it.
13anyway two things, magnetic reversal takes much longer than a day
:(
fuck this family
13and two, that would pretty well screw up satellites
the earth poles have alway shifted exactly 180° (they just shifted places) quite often in history, but it usually didn't led to gttreat desasters
13so there's a tiny bit more realism for that
The magnetic poles are flipping us off.
great desasters*
14Good point.
00,10and it takes a long time to fly from vegas to hawaii
13anyway magnetic poles flip all the time, just on the scale of thousands and thousands of years, not a few hours
I don't hate him. I just really really dislike him.

Suddenly they see him.
COINCEDINCE?!
The Avatar saved them! :D
00,10yeah they found out it was comeing sooner then expected
Aang!
00,10this all takes place in early summer
how much money did it take to make this film?
IAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Yeah sorry, this is like a cartoon.
For Christ's sake. Why the animals?
No way I can buy this
government
13Meanwhile: nah no macguffins in this movie, macguffin would be like the briefcase in pulp fiction, magic plot inducing device for the sake of a plot inducing device
By money
doesn't sound good for the waistline
why do they need elephants?
Sooooo....money equals good genes?
this is about when i would commit suicide
Awesome! I'm drunk. Let's do this
05,15"Life isn't fair!?"
14Not really. Luckily I have a pretty high metabolism, it would seem.
Yes, we get it movie, he's a wanker
This looks Halo-ish
They die... right?
Dickish, but realistic
The yare all gooign to die o nthose ships from Lead paint poisoning
Noah's Ark.
00,10money = ticket to pay for construction
For funsies?
He's a wanker but he IS right.
Mass Effect takes place right after
*shrugs*
they ded
04Suddenly we cut to a Transformers movie in India
08,01he's not a wanker, he's a realist
its the end of the world , and they STILL only care about money.
13welp, india wanted a public swimming pool
This....this is hard to watch...
survivors=those people with nothing
11,01Oh, hey, a town with no electricity has a siren?
Surfs up
05,15The briefcase from Pulp Fiction is THE macguffin
:(
11,01.
oh no India
and finally the president advisor whatever hits the heelturn
04With Shia Lebouf trying to play off being lost in India
IT'S A TRAP!
They are now in the otherworld
probably more about size than weight ...
And besides, the realist angle isn't realist in this movie.
Could've, but there's no luxury in that.
Hey a mile high tidal wave
But it would be crowded.
00,10phone still works
05,15What is this? We can overpopulate this ship!
13in a town with no electricity

05,15Awwww
05,15But I could have won that
Saturn: Are you mad at me? ( i won't blame you if you are ) :(
I predict Gordon or the blonde might die. Guessing.
04Nice Derpy
I got 20 on Gordon
04And I say Gordon dies

Thats not a bad deal at all
RD, why do you even try?
supernatural could refer to magic as it is not magic, and coming from Twilight, the element of MAGIC, that is kinda... hypocritical dont you think?
