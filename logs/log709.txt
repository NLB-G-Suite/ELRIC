pans labrinyth. Its the scarier companion to the david bowie movie
you're going to poop your pants
I mean infos from someone who actually watched it or knows it good
Serenity: The name sounds like I should know you, but I've probably forgotten.
RAWRity: I experienced that in 2007
i dont trust those sites
so its a horror movie?
Fazana, Very_Silly_Filly, Serenity, blahdiblah
its suppose to be, i've never seen it
Pan's Labyrinth is brilliant
RAWRity, those were some of the best days
Serenity: Oh right. Hallo.
frankly i'd prefer the scariest movie i've ever seen. which is the shining
god that movie is scary
So im going to watch a horror movie..Drunk?
wow that will be...fuck i cant even think about it
Kubrick is a excellent director. and those little girls -shudder-
I like Pan's Labyrinth, it's a horror fairy tale with nazis
Did anybody else have a gameboy camera and a gameboy printer?
nazis make everything better
JappleAck: I had a printer, but no camera
Nazis make everything 88% Cooler
I lost my Game boy pockets, but I still have 2 GBA SP's
right guis?? right?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Conan's "Brony Wars"
zombis make everything cooler
cmon RainbowAsh....that one was good...
Zombies are used too often.
ever seen nazi zombies
Serenity: i sold my gb camera for about $40 to some kid
I've seen nazi zombies in space.
Jake: I instantly think CoDfag when that's mentioned
Times sure have changed :L
Meanwhile have i you ever hugged any one?
Serenity: Same here.
CCCP: No.
i've seen nazis play mahjong in space against robots
the best fictional series ever
lets say I have never even touched Cod Battlefield or MW
TheMaster: PICS OR DIDNT HAPPEN
back, I got some pizza
Meanwhile you poor thing... want a hug?
CCCP: Inb4 no
^
I warn you. No comic is ever as awesome as this. its about real world leaders settling their differences with hot blooded...mahjong battles. http://www.mangareader.net/1413-45749-7/the-legend-of-koizumi/chapter-1.html
:C
Was the infrared on the Gameboy Color ever used?
highlights include President George H.W Bush flexing his suit off staring down Vladimir putin
JappleAck: I think it was used in pokkymans
JappleAck: i never used it
But it failed hard because Infrared
Wish I still had my gameboy pockets
oh no
And back

Jake: do you have a Gameboy(original) though?
Bye CCCP
bye CCCP :)

TheMaster: Given that the Pope was in the Hitler Youth he probably wouldn't be playing against.
cyborg Kim Jong Il vs. the prime minister of japan on a aircraft carrier with nuclear missiles on the line
JappleAck: no
later CCCP
:)
Last time was in the 70's when some hippy rockstar set his amp on too high and blew over a bunch of carivans
meanwhile, not that pope. in the manga is pope john paul II
Well, im Afk untill FRIDAAAAAY NIIIIAAAIIIGHT starts....so ill leave you with my Life in a nutshell and say Bye!

Barb|MaskedZombie: Don't be mean, I'm sure he put *all* his heart into that

Neutrinos :D
2012 is B Movie
in all human history? How can you tell?
Hello.
The NEutrinos!
That's not human history, numnuts
Should we call 2012, plot convenience the movie
It's full of stars
Have mutated!
i'm okay with this
My God… he take off his glasses when he said that.
Neutrinos: spanish men of Science food
what the hell is a neutrino
only if it's covered in rohypnol
Went to a lecture on the 2012 predictions. This is not very accurate.

08,01lolindians
Aw hell, 2012?
Ummm... How would they know it was the biggest eruption in human history if the means of measuring the size of eruptions have only been around for 50 years or so?
Science stuff alexxm

Dark_Horst: yes

Hi Ouroblock
pony_300: B movie is forst today

rohypnol?
Well, this part is set in 2009.

08,01ah, neutrino detector

Neutrinos mutated. What the fuck are you talkingabout.

We're a giant popcorn kernel?

alexxm: Google, she is your friend. But they can't mutate, they are fundamental particles
Hooray for Geothermal energy!
How the hell is this even logical?
Hi, Ouroboros. :)
jey
Where did these guys get their degrees...
00,10if the water is boiling in that thing, why do we have it sealed?

why are we watching the b movie first :( I was looking forward to pan's labyrinth but it'll be at least 3 am here by then :(
AJIsAwesome: nope 2012
how can you change particles?
I call bullshit. Neutrinos don't interact with matter.
BroPony|MEDIC: Why B Movi first?
Can't do that. I have a niece to look after.
He might as well have said "THE SALSA IS HERE"
When is this so called "end of the world" again? December 21?
It's time for the percolator
1.7 billion money
Sumica, their cooking ramen noodles.
Rarity raised that money!
AJIsAwesome: Idk

is that the ... one guy from beetlejuice?
winter solstice wasn't it?
/me 08,01wonders what Nittany_Discord's favourite particle is
you need a black tie to attend a party?!
There's no way by that a Solar erruption could cause the earths core to heat up
AJIsAwesome: i believe that the A movie is longer
05,15I'm a fan of Photons myself
04Easy, dammit. Easy!
sleeeeeeeeep
you paid too much for it
600?! :S
Tamazarashi: It's a formal party
Black tie event? Look atme?
00,10so the owner of budwiser is president?
fuck
Dang it of all the nights you had to switch the movies around. I have a Halloween party downstairs that I decided to get out from a moment. I'll have to go back down in a bit, and I wanted to see us make fun of 2012 is full
Ok well if it's 2012 first I'ma gonna get going. Bye guys!

Mr. President.... Pinkie Pie: Hai :D
Hey, everybody.

why isnt morgan freeman the president
It's the end of the world - lets spend our last moments doing something meaningful - protest & loot stuff!
This is in Polish!? At least I assume
I suppose it makes sense to show B first tonight, as A is rated R.
Hello MrBen
no ones going to die in 2012 people
Hi MrBen :)
Hi MrBen
hi MrBen
Hi, MrBen! :)
Would've been here earlier, but I had to get called backed into work real fast...
I predict that this movie is stupid, but I've never seen it.
How would one go about making a voldemort pony? He doesn't have a nose.
Here's another thing, were they unable to afford Morgan Freeman?
how've you been MrBen
Franek12354: no they were talking in russian
Dr. Strangelove's table was cooler
04"Season 3 was being delayed"
wait.. is THe B movie showing first???
"I was in the day after tomorrow"
I've always knew Glover would be present in the future
DELEAYED?!
twilight_sprinkle: Close enough :)
alexxm: Doing alright. For the most part.
magmablock: I think the wind went out of the sails when 2000 came. Now nobody gives a fuck about prophesized dates.
the 2012 theory doesnt predict the end of the world, it predicts a drastic change
We were going to run out of bacon by 2012.
I will see everypony here on December 22 :)
we're fucked...
nooope
we're boned
by pony invasion
Predators are hunting us again! :O

Cypresswolf: Same here. :)
Nope.jpg

THIS DAMN PROJECT!
Maybe the drastic change is a cure for cancer :3
weeping_pegasi82: What do you mean?
05,15BroPony|MEDIC it doesn't even do that
It's a new beginning, like every New Year that has ever existed...not an earth shattering kaboom...but that doesn't make a good movie, does it?

ThePillowship: Okay, I was wondering! ...Any reason why?

hey guys what we watching
Our Protagonist, Laies and Gentleman
thats an old ass theory
This movie has a few months till it looses the point of it's name
00,10Foreshadoing already/
he's ded
yes you are
Hey Michael
we're all dead men
The end of the Mayan calender does not mean end of the world, it means get a new calender
The Mayan calendar doesn't say the world is going to end, it's just when the calendar ends
MrBen, because they want to :3
04He's really, really missing a boombox, dammit
celestial alighnment my ass
04Where's his boombox
Im a dead man.... Wait 4 hours
Tovler, the only thing holding Obama back is that he wants to be re-elected. If he gets over that hurdle, he'll get away with anything he wants, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says.
skipple shure piedram orpreder
hi Polydunami
Two months till we're all dead men
lol Thugging_Centipede
You know. I'm willing to bet what the ancient Mayans actually knew about "Mutating meutrinos" could fit into the Grand Canyon and still leave room for the rest of the entire Universe... :|
HIAAAAAA GUYS
04Where is his window to blare it in
Nick?
ThePillowship: Alright. Not a problem.
Hey abrony

08,01Mutterguy: why?
Y'know, if the world were ending. I'd devote every waking moment to understanding WHY it was ending.
00,10great FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU face
The biggest thing about 2012 is that MRE's gonna go on sale and there'll be a baby boom.

08,01Mutterguy: and what kind of quark?
hi abrony
he has a phone but no alarm?
08,01(there are 6)

Wait
Is that a Limo
AlienWarhead: I guess it only happens in the movies
04Hah
Megalomanic: you`ll GET weak after 4 days of not going to sleo
alexxm: that is the real question
The idea here is that the Mayan Calander's 5th age runs out on December 21st 2012, and this is somehow fortelling the end of the world.
04That's me and my nephew and niece, basically
limo is best vehicle
05,15Personally I can't wait until December 21st 2012. It's going to be awesome
who needs kids when you've got the internet!
04We should show 2012 that night
Who knows.
I like listening to the arguements of bitchy divorced couples in movies -_-
05,15Everyone's going to be freaking out and NOOOOTHING is going to happen
I live in New York. I remember when we got a 6.5 quake about 15-16 years ago and everyone thought that was a really big deal.
oh no not that guy, I live that guy but he dies. :(
fluttercry: Exactly! :D
fluttercry: Ikr, I did the same thing on May 26th
what if the spanish comquered them before they could finish it
I'd be willing to play the air raid siren on that day.
fluttercry: And maybe a new pony episode
04So at least in one plane of existence, it DOES happen
I can't think of a way to draw a noseless pony at all.
Gnight everypony! HF

Dec 21 is just after a friend's birthday :P

Hey, to be totally random, does anyone have Killing Floor? I'm bout to buy that on steam and want to know if it's worth it
fluttercry: What happened on Y2K?
that ain't good.
fluttercry: Tell me about it. I was freaking the hell out on June 6th, 2006
fluttercry: And May 26th 2011
Who lets Captn Noob touch the wheel again?
08,01i'm quite enjoying this so far
This is just too silly :|
04Yes, Killing Floor is worth it
shit juat got real yo
I blame JB for all of this
Kandarihu: but is there scientific proof from anyone that a solar flare or whatever will happen by december
fluttercry: nobody really believes in the 2012 thing though
Killing Floor is pretty fun.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
08,01it's like independence day
Oh an earthquake
08,01but shit
who touched the wheels?
DERPY!!
french, right?
cpt planet is pissed guys
04Independence Day was pretty terrible too
00,10it's not a proper disaster movie with out a ship
Probably because a good amount of it isn't in English.
^
08,01BronyInstrumental: nope
earthquake, seems not legit
Ghosties: Good, Cuz i'm buying the entire bundle for 75% off
05,15^
I Survive 2000... I Survive 6/6/6 .... And Now... 2012..... COME AT ME BRO >: )
fluttercry, the Y2K bug was a serious problem when it was discovered. It took some work to fix the bug, and almost everyone was unaffected.
It's not stellar, but since it's on sale I'd say it's worth it.
00,10roha boooooom
OH SHIT
I'm experienced with earthquakes. been through 10,000 of them

>_>
listen to him
BoulderDash: Oh, okay :p
Machine guns, they looked like M4s or M16s to me
I'll just ask another question. Why does this movie even exist? If everybody knows how the movie end, what's the fun?
machine guns best shovel
digging with machine guns. seems legit
J_E_Smith71: Nope.
...wait it's only be 30 minutes of course it hasn't
than why are qwe starting twith the B Movie?
The Jackson Curtis, who never accomplished anything of note?
Yeaaaah. So end of the world
Ending on a better movie, I guess
fan
You should go home and die now

Actually, you'd probably need a Gatling Gun to do any REAL digging... with bullets
Sumica: What the length og this movie?
*What's

04Wait
Independance Day After Tomorrow, 2012
FORESHADOWING

maybe the B was much longer than the A?
04This is the second movie I've seen where John is a writer
Also, Digging with bullets
best way to dig
H1N1 did it.
It was a pleasure. Now go to the gas chamber.
How about Pandora's, Sumi?

00,10time for adrian to go on a quest
WE ALL GONNA DIE!
Eli: Yeah they switched A and B
haha my coffee got cold since I left it alone for so long
00,10a brody quest perhaps
08,01Sciaenops: no, because of neutrinos turning into microwaves
how does a solar flare cause earth destabilzation again?
NO THEY DIDN'T
and i'm back
fuck science
Sciaenops: IKR? STUPIED AS HEEL
Triple check the checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist
This movie is used to scare people lol.
a solar flare would not cause this
ducking doctor phlox in there
How did they see it coming? HOW?
The entire Earth is turning into a delicious Creme Brulee... :|
dat dance
damn Mayans.
dammit
So moral of the story: microwaves will be the death of us all.
08,01delicious taffy.
Magic, Ryu. Ancient Mayan magic.
myians had aliens to tell them***
you have all the time in the world
the entire family
Ryunosuke, probably generating magnetic waves that destabalize the tectonic plates.
cold coffee = notbad.jpg
J_E_Smith71: this movie isn't deserving of being an A movie
uhh
04Iced coffee is the bomb
that wouldnt be a solar flare
Mayans didn't predict shit, they just didn't feel like writing down their calender to the year 5 billion
Bane: Scare people? I think that's a horror movie you are talking about
08,01Biglaw: my mother is indian, and i still find the accent funny
eli its b
Pretend for a minute this is true, how are we to survive/stop this?
hobo ftw
In the end of tehe world... I going to say in facebook ''The earth is broken''... And RUNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!
A ship to the universe
A is not a matter of quality, so much as how much they spent advertising it.
what-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
This is the B movie, it is being shown forst because of the graphicness of the A movie IIRC
00,10they said get out
Dirty hippie
08,01especially when she pronounces words computetely wrong
twilight_sprinkle: I don't think so, they only heat hotpockets
It's the guy from Birdemic!
Crazy hippie man
Eli: Well techincally it's not A. I mean we swapped the order and showing B movie first
Huh, he's like the mountain lion guy from Birdemic.
government guys!!
this can only end with shameful videos
Thugging_Centipede: aww
04You know, these redwoods are being destroyed by the Spruce Bark Beetles!
Ghosties: I wish it was Iced coffee, its just coffee that I got to lazy to re-heat

HU HU HA HA
Woody makes a good crazy hippie
unwashed hippy knows THE TRUTH
has it started yet?
la la la la la
J_E_Smith71: yeah. actually it's not even deserving of being a B movie... to me that is at most an F movie.
secondly, a solar flare would not cause magma displacement
Does temperature rise with velocity?
I'M LAUGHING AT THE STUPIDITY OF THIS MOVIE
Save valve
it's not only Yellowstone...Redstone is in danger too
NAOW
Z movie.
As long as I see season 3, I don't care if the world ends.
There's no science in this movie. Not really.
We'll save what we can...meaning only the rich and powerful...
OJ: pretty sua ya
Lil_B what about Bluestone, and Greenstone
Thugging_Centipede: At least you are. I'm getting headaches from it.
Meanwhile: yeah exactly.
Dashie_Dashie: agreed
08,01Meanwhile: well, someof the things they said about neutrinos is true
Lil_B: YEAH! HOW AM I GONNA DO MY CIRCUITS?
Also the Mayans did not have leap days so their timing is off and the world should have happened already
Meanwhile: that assumes there is science in any movie
08,01maybe like... 50%
-0 movie
haha yeah skate's pretty funny sometimes
You bronies are in luck because mlp fim s3 starts in november
Implying that 1B euros paid will mean shit after society collapses

Pumpkin : Give me the Boat... Give a car... No... I don't want that >: (
Ghosties is it so wrong, to once watch a Movie purely for the Visuals?

mmmyup
That's exactly what I thought.
13to be fair, anheuser doesn't have many options to prevent humans from destroying themselves while the world falls apart
COUBIAAAAAA
He will return as President the White
11,01Actually, yes *holds hands*
And then everyone picks him up and throws him out.
I could sing Kumbaya... :)
Dat plane.
04So I know how to enjoy a good visual movie boi
05,15You know....they're supposed to make you hate this guy...but I like him. He makes sense
I don't know.
two weeks!
How so?
Shizuka I know: The movie is trying to treat him like a villian, when he is the one who is actually making everything happen!
00,10Danny noooooooo
04Just wait til Citizen Kane plays on BronyState, I wonder if Lil_B will be saying what he said to me then
because logic
Makes better sense than any of the friendly options.
13central planning only works on small scales like six Arks holding the last of civilization
Ghosties I love Citizen Kane >.<
Welcome to Hollywood, where Obama is a reasonable authority figure.
this burden is too much for me!

People are fickle and most of them are useless.
04Touche, B. Touche

Nooooooo not Flutterguy :'(
No.
Sumica: NOOOO... DONUT :(
04We will meet again...
Well, if we can't save Danny Glover... can we at least have Donald Glover?
Not enough strength to get on a damn plane.
11,01Hell, the world should just end.
why did you, Glover? WHY? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
/me flys away in jetpacks
yay
dat yay
Shizuka And the president, instead of leading the remandier of humanity, is staying in the obviously doomed world to lead these people to their death!
oh no its a sad scene :/
I'm dissapointed they didn't get morgan freeman to play the president
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like a black Tom Waits?
NO! NO YAY! NO YAY!
:'(
13i'm sorry i became president sweetie
00,10I think they had 12 arc's planed

05,15But yeah, I totally agree with the "villain" He's trying to save as much of humanity as possible
:'(
lol

No more Mr. Presidant?

This is too much for me.

New York looks fine.
Suckers
dat virgin
13tvtropes notes it too, anheuser is the second antagonist (first being, well, earth), but he's also one of the few sensible people in the film
New York is still standing.
why are people watching him talk?
fluttercry: He might like him more at the end
Megalomanic: im guessing you got the name from incubus
11,01We need a better Obama actor.

Shizuka, typically
Who's responsible for the end of the world? DINKLEBERG...............
Hmm, TF2 update again?
00,10they just hooked yuri's blood up directly to the fuel lines
Shizuka: minecraft question: what are your thought when you think of "team avo"
?
04Yep
But what if there's zombies?
/me Planet of the Apes reference
04Culture is our essence
13Derpy_Hooves: who?
Where`s Chuck when you need him
seems someone hasn't noticed that nature is a DICK
Shizu: It's a Russian plane, it runs on communism. Ergo the fuel is equally distributed across all engines, resulting in glorious traveling distances.
You'r a bad actor girl
Dinkleberg from farly odd parents?
Jackson!
05,15CriticKitten LOL
Then that's fine.
He invented Bioshock.
oh yeah. 50 cent
HAHA
ya, chuck norris would just roundhouse the plane directly to china ;)
he actually is on a plane
What are the odds?
CCCP: actress*
13the only other thing is the earth is shifting underneath them which is why they get to the himalayas and not the south china sea
OohShiny :P
Shizuka: they were most likey the biggest minecraft griefers in t4he games history
00,03Damn communist planes... mucking up our capitaist air...
13even still, they should have been more surprised to get to hawaii so soon
Shizuka Okay, that kinda makes sense
CCCP: :S
Anything to tell anyone about what you're reading, eh?
If this was real i'd hide in a huge box of bedrock until it's over.
Shizuka: Can you do a roll call of all the stereotypes in this movie?
oh no
Bunny slippers.
omg this part I hated it D:
Shizuka: it took two years before they were actually global banned
13Derpy_Hooves: oh, i don't play multiplayer except with maybe two friends
bunny slippers
Shizuka in a stupid way
if that's OK with you?
It's me Run!

Dam it Ash, stop killing people.
Derpy_hooves he's dumb

Shizuka, Volcanic fallout of course it would. :p
why did the good kid had to die instead of the jerks :(
Not if they did not breather it in.
13i think i'm like the barest northern edge of where the ash cloud would go, weather permitting
What is the presidents in this movies political views?
04The President's getting too old for this shit
why is the president so heroic?
fluttercry: it's going to suck when the yellowstone super volcano erupts irl
What will happen?
13given enough days it would hit the rest of the world, this movie forgets that part
uh oh
The president was in Predator 2.
dohoho

Shouldn't they be wearing dust masks?

That obelisk is tormenting them
And just on cue, my nieces come running in. xD
04Oh fuck, North Carolina is gonna sink!

No.
time to start the repopulation!
people are dying
Nyst Oh you will see them, and they are dumb
13tbf by this point the stations able to transmit to the satellites are probably dead
There's a Rifftrax of this movie, right?
off to the baby-car!
13that and they're over water trying to tune in FM
Is this scene important to the story?
Nyst: Maybe they are Space Colony Arks
/me 14pets the silence.
/me prys himself out of the pile
meanwhile everyones dying
13just not going to happen
Kandarihu: Most likely
/me everyone is dying.
Shizuka Sattilite....car
I don't know.

"Do you think we can do this, with you having a husband, and the world ENDING and all"
Nope, never seen this before.
-_-
hey adjeca
04MGS
Ghosties I kinda revise my statement, while this Movie m,ay be the best use of CGI I've seen (it looks good, and destruction in this scale can't be done with other effects), but they expect us too take this story seriously, and thats Bullshit :/
04METAL GEAR SHOSTIES
00,03I guess you can say their reltionship was... Like a bridge over Troubled water!
13Sumica: and the only station is three dog
how's things?
Got to start repopulating the human race
Also joined halfway though because I had -NO IDEA- that there was a movie today!
Pointing out that official room follows official rules. Less /me.
it's trying to let you know the characters duh!
00,03relationship*
hey everypony :) what are we watchin'?
13Scoot-Scootaloo: and you said my joke was bad
Well you could of talked to him about rather than divorce him idiot.
04I'm glad you've come around, B~
Scoot-Scootaloo: aaaauuugh.
Can't wait for him to die
Yay
He is going to die
yay
Ghosties, only if battle can break out in the Tunnel of Love.
00,03NO U, shizu >: (
05,15Anybody else want to learn HAM radio with me?
hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
Mike Kevin and Bill seemed to have stopped doing riffs of recent hollywood movies
LOVE TIME NOW!!!
14Fine. You?
13fluttercry: want to... but broke .-.
Scoot-Scootaloo: man your jokes are washed up
14Or was that directed at Cades?
Howdy Sketch_Toku_Brony!
Doctor who?
I'd play this https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/545467_462603910449867_1473194920_n.jpg
00,03fluttercry: will there be bacon?
fluttercry you're just making me hungry for a sandwich.
14.w.
05,15Shizuka awww :(
04I'm glad they've stopped, actually. I think the older movies are better riffable
Shizuka: dats galaxy news radio, ma'm
Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony. :)
whomever hehe
Wat.
/me "i agree, Meanwhile, thats why ill do it propper"
Cho ming.. Yao ming
Quickly we can escape the end of da world with that blue portal! The red one's in Equestria
14'kay, haha.
so many bad jokes!!
We're expecting widespread incontinence
.....
/me hugs Shizuka and Scoot-Scootaloo together
Dat tatoo.
proper*
That's bullshit. XD
00,10polls move, still able to navigate
05,15It'd be fun because then you get to be "that guy" with a huge antenna in your yard
IshPonyThePonyPony: :D
Propppper
23 degrees? that would be hundreds of kms...
The earth reverses its poles all the time.
southwest......where australia is!I KNEW IT!
i'm glad it's the weekend :)
lol
WISCONSIN lol
lols
DOOOohh
It really is Phlox!
WUT
seems legit
except most of the riffs on the older movies are bad.
14Same. xD I got lucky and didn't have any school today.
13and yesh it's phlox
Shizuka I thought he was from the mooooon
Close enough.
04And the Wisconsin cheese is now somewhere in Portugal
OH NO THE SHIP IS FALLING.
so where did Santa move to then?
dont die shasha
13he was also in stargate sg1's later seasons
And their instruments would now be useless.
WAAAAAAHHHHT
15 = 18
lol
Shizuka: slowpoke.jpg
Well I always said that Wisconsin was going south with all of those backwards politics, but did they listen? NOOOOOOO....
"DAH"
da
11,01Portugal cheese.
"DAAAHHH"
Santa drowned.
05,15So he's like Stephen King and Maine?
14But I had to go to see my counselor and then to Wal-Mart, instead. >:C
Wisconsin is the south pole now? Now.... I just can't picture it.
04Don'tcha want some Portugal cheese, kids?
Oh.. so the magnetic poles are flipping in this movie?
Oh, so the magnetic poles are changing too?
so where's the north pole then?
13anyway two things, magnetic reversal takes much longer than a day
:(
fuck this family
13and two, that would pretty well screw up satellites
the earth poles have alway shifted exactly 180° (they just shifted places) quite often in history, but it usually didn't led to gttreat desasters
aye. still better than school i say
00,10true Shizuka
13so there's a tiny bit more realism for that
The magnetic poles are flipping us off.
great desasters*
14Good point.
hes better than me
00,10and it takes a long time to fly from vegas to hawaii
why would he want to save them? It means less food for him
CriticKitten, there has been some improvements, thanks to Scott Walker.
your kinda hoping they're gonna die
Shizuka: Magnetic reversal was recently disprovern
Why would you hate Gordon Freeman?
13anyway magnetic poles flip all the time, just on the scale of thousands and thousands of years, not a few hours
I don't hate him. I just really really dislike him.
05,15"Because he hit me with a crowbar"
because he's banging my wife
04Hasn't the human race yet to experience a polar shift, though? So we're not quite sure how it's going to affect the earth and our race?
Nonsense, Shizu. The planet obviously hired Magneto to shift the world's magnetic poles.
b/c Gordon never gets enough altitude
Shizuka: PHYSICS!
hmmm... I thought at the highest speeds, the poles would take alot longer than a few days
because gordon is better than you?
inb4 he sees a Giant Asteroid outside the window
Because he took my crowbar when we were kids.
i hate earth
Suddenly father son moment.
13Spazturtle: core samples show clear bands of magnetic alignment in opposite directions that represent many years, we know it's a thing :)
Ghosties: well yeah. actually, ours is late to the party
but he ****
Ihate kids in movies.
i've always disliked school
i never went to highschool
pony_2812: Don't wanna live on this planet anymore?
pony_2812: TO EQUISTRIA
oni chan
the only good kid was yoko
Um... Is Pan's Labyrinth over already?
Especially in disaster movies
At least the kids are not being annoying now.
05,15DocSane no
even I knew that
00,103 down
Shizuka: about every 750.000 years, wastn it?
Bane well she is dead sadly
05,15We're doing B first tonight
14I'm a freshman right now, and hating it.
It's gonna be a little bumpy and a little wet.
13something like that
DocSane: NOPE, NEVER STARTED
hi DocSane
And Lilly's not a bad person.
Shizuka yeah but maybe the earth going nuts changes it faster? not that i know much about geology
640k
04We haven't started Pan's Labyrinth yet
i thought santa was shot down over the sea of japan
so.... what did I miss? ^^
Docsane no we switched movie times
Why the switch?
Only time where kids arent annoying are kids movies ironicaly
fluttercry can i ask why?
fluttercry: What is A again?
All I'm hearing is I need to find a way to squat in antarchtica. So years down the line, when poles shift, my descendents will own the continent
hello Panda!
Pan's Labyrinth tonight? Bitchin'. That movie's sweet.
I'm a freshman too
14But luckily I'm getting moved to an alternate school next week. :)
yes becuase engines catch fire when they runout of fuel
ohai Panda
05,15A movie is Pan's Labryinth
Oh sweet
CCCP ^^ hello there
00,10because spiderman.mp4
aye, yep i went for a little bit that's all
no, he was killed by terrorists in imaginationland
13twilight_sprinkle: possibly, but the thing is magnetic reversal understandably screws up the magnetic field for a while, which exposes us to the solar winds
Panda!
and to you too Lil_B
As far as I'm concerned, Pan's Labyrinth is the main event.
Bit late to tell daddy that, sweetie
Panda: lucky you, most of thismovie
And I'll make it most likely
14It's internet-based. ouo
You have a lifejacket you will be okay.
DocSane: I think it is because 2012 is longer
Change of plans.
Sumica: might wanna show that just after
Spazturtle: the lack of fuel can even cause the plane to explode!
13forget the earth destabilizing under you, the sun will fry your butt if the poles reversed
still graduated by self teaching :)
Oh that's interesting?
Conyst O_o and Celestia`s_Bunny... uh.. why are you a bunny?
14My reaction: "oh HELL yeah"
04So when the polar shift happen, will Santa be living in the South Pole from then on?
except here IS china
internet based.. ? o.o
family vacation to china cut short
how long is this movie?
Not a good swimmer, time to learn MOFOS~
YAY
Pinkie promise.
quit whining
Ghosties: ah man i always wanted to see Pan's Labryinth,never saw it :D is David Bowie in it?!
pinkie promies
13no we're not kid, the camera keeps focusing on us
GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVER
why doesn't he just eat them and then use them as blubber for the winter?
05,15Santa Clause lives in Lapland

We will all be together when we die, I promise.
You can't die, you're main characters
ah
Sketch_Toku_Brony: XD
Fluttershy is yaying for their deaths. THe kids that is.
Conyst ^^ how are you?
14And then I go to a school in the afternoon and work there.
we're gonna die, yay
Shizuka: maybe, but hey, at least youd get a wicked tan~
they went from the US to china in 1 day?
CCCP: like that other movie?
04No no, you're thinking of the Labyrinth, Sketch
Ghosties: Why the switch? Was it because Flutterguy's voice was in this movie and you wanted to play Bridle Gossip afterwards so it'd be more fitting?
last world problems
Awkward Gordon.
cross my heart and hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye!
Unless it's a horror movie.
13this marriage is less stable than the earth >>

Pee your pants in fear.
13the glacier is going to get rocky? hope it's the director's cut

The end of the world and the flights are STILL delayed.
Sorry for the big curse word everypony, but i was angry and ran out of things to say
Shizuka: I think that's more up to his cinematographer.
Green cards? Symbolism?
lol not so different now
lol karmas a bitch isn't it Yuri?
Meanwhile: figures
00,10Lil_B, they did't know it would happen early

It's the sound of the Orcs.

Shizu: Only if they end up walking to a volcano and throw the bimbo into it
Run
Sumica: No, they have, like, 2 hours or something.
Always the good guys who sacrifice their lives for the backstabbers.
The pilot.

It's the Balrog
After the macguffin
Suddenly they see him.
leave it to the monk to save the day
COINCEDINCE?!
The Avatar saved them! :D
00,10yeah they found out it was comeing sooner then expected
Shizuka: with the trees cut to half? IF ONLY WE KNEW BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!
What are the odds?
Aang!
00,10this all takes place in early summer
dat ship is big
how much money did it take to make this film?
IAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Yeah sorry, this is like a cartoon.
Sumica Thats what SHE said! :D
Sorry, got in here late. I this the 2012 movie?
CCCP: Like 250 million
No way I can buy this
Sounds legit.
Swag
government
JimmyRussell: yes, and we havent watched A movie yet
JimmyRussell Eyup
So only the smart people came here?
By money
JimmyRussell: Yh the A is showing next
doesn't sound good for the waistline
why do they need elephants?
So, the future of Mankind will be decended from the prievious era's politicians...- Yep, I think I'll happily welcome the end with open arms
Sooooo....money equals good genes?
otakon17 that money could of gone to a good cause
05,15I love that line
this is about when i would commit suicide
Awesome! I'm drunk. Let's do this
05,15"Life isn't fair!?"
what a dick head
14Not really. Luckily I have a pretty high metabolism, it would seem.
Yes, we get it movie, he's a wanker
This looks Halo-ish
They die... right?
Shizu: Yeah true, pardon my terminology.
Dickish, but realistic
The yare all gooign to die o nthose ships from Lead paint poisoning
Noah's Ark.
00,10money = ticket to pay for construction
For funsies?
He's a wanker but he IS right.
let me take a wild guess...the huge superplanned arks will fail
Mass Effect takes place right after
Silent Hill siren :D
Um, like 6 billion people are dying today. Hell, yeah, life isn't fair.
We'll see who's laughing when you can't find anyone to jailbreak your iPod
*shrugs*
they ded
Well, the least you can do is poison the workers. Give them a painless death.
oh god
04Suddenly we cut to a Transformers movie in India
08,01he's not a wanker, he's a realist
its the end of the world , and they STILL only care about money.
ah that's cool. same here, i can't ever seem to gain weight no matter how much/what i eat
and then life happened
Just came back from a halloween party. I was NoFace from Spirited Away
13welp, india wanted a public swimming pool
This....this is hard to watch...
survivors=those people with nothing
11,01Oh, hey, a town with no electricity has a siren?
Surfs up
05,15The briefcase from Pulp Fiction is THE macguffin
:(
11,01.
oh no India
Pale_Horse: Technically he's both.
and finally the president advisor whatever hits the heelturn
JimmyRussell: Nice!
04With Shia Lebouf trying to play off being lost in India
IT'S A TRAP!
They are now in the otherworld
probably more about size than weight ...
And besides, the realist angle isn't realist in this movie.
Could've, but there's no luxury in that.
Hey a mile high tidal wave
But it would be crowded.
13suddenly cell reception
Yay
00,10phone still works
05,15What is this? We can overpopulate this ship!
13in a town with no electricity
err, switch taht
Cell Service? Nope...
14I've been gaining weight, but that's probably good because I was rather underweight for a while, that time because of a medicine that made me lose my appetite.
04"I'm just casually talking to you while I'm about to die"
00,10must be sat phone
I... think i'm going to die now... :(
AJIsAwesome: Oh it was awesome. I even handed out those golden chocolate coins to peeps
Oh no they ded.
stupid bastards! >:(
Shizuka: in a bucker in CHINA
government hates indians
Good damn cell service!
nooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RIP Satnam
well I suppose he was supposed to be the heel in the first place, but now he actually seems like one

BUT IT'S STILL SO SAD
green screen like a mutha
This is worse than the ME3 ending. We don't even get to choose the color of the tidal wave.
I HATE THESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS!
Ded.
Sad part ever
this movie sure has its moodwhiplashes
00,03Scatman John*

Kandarihu: :D
Now he's pissed.

08,01we need people to write softrware.
Sumica: ...........

13seriously what did our hero expect? standing room only on the ark to hold the last of humanity for an indeterminate amount of time?
yay!
Earth is trolling everyone.
yay? what!
"Money talks."
it is
yay again?
dat inappriate yay
chaos?
What movie is after this one?
CCCP:nope, he survived the 1o mile high tidal wave without a scratch
14Yeah. XD

13once again, anheuser the only sensible character
fuck.
its ready, the pizza, its ready!
00,101,500 foot high wave
08,01we need the indians to write the software, and the chinese to build the hardware
well fuck
05,15Yeah, overcrowding would be pretty bad. Those ships aren't supposed to hold people for a week.
OH WOW
Welp, they ded.
Well, yer fucked.

damn, that's 500 meters high wave
Sumica: No meters
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Shit just got real
Satnam was pretty important though, one of the people that shouldve been picked up
04This movie is like three hours long
We'd all be fucked.
the world is fucked
2 minutes
What will happen?
oni_link: wat are Murricans?
Only gonna save like 50K peoples
4 minutes, Turkish
Unless they happen to be building the Arks under your house and the security is lax.
hai bronystate!!! :)
30 minutes left of the mission
Which movie is after this one?
RosePetal: lots of water
05,15I'm a wizard and that's fucked up
I super excited for things to happen in space
hi brony2447
Ghosties: i like this movie :3 (speaking the truth)
brain anyone ? damage Anyone getting else
Hi, brony2447. :)
hello brony2447
The worst part of this movie is that the money could of gone to a charity or somthing
lol
Remember, all this happens in a month or so, kids.
fluttercry: you're a wizard?
hi brony2447 :)
hello brony2447
For once I'll defend this movie (it won't happen again): Even the realist angle is stupid. There's no way they could reliably create all of this, and even if they could, there's nowhere to go anyways. Humanity is effectively screwed regardless.
:D
I guess.
shit
13taking bets on the next kill, no cheating if you've seen the movie already
say your prayers mankind, if you believe that shit
05,15I'm a wizard
hi brony2447
I'll bet you can't tell this is the same guy who did Independance Day, with Washington getting destroyed, and the ominous countdown and the planes taking off just in time and the President doing something noble and the...
Shizuka: Yuri.
Glasses guy?
05,15Awwww
fake backround
05,15But I could have won that
why do I get the feeling they're building up Gordon to be likable so they can kill him dramatically? :S
I predict Gordon or the blonde might die. Guessing.
i got some MLP TF2 mods and i am stoked to start using them
Shizuka: im not betting then, i love this molvie, seen it 6 times already
Shizu: Five bits on Gordon.
oni_link: it sounds dumb:/
04Nice Derpy
I got 20 on Gordon
I want to bet Gordon, he never gets enough altitude.
04And I say Gordon dies
aang help them
00,10till the earth and water and fire nations teamed up
Meanwhile in Area 63
I don't. IshPonyThePonyPony, but I don't blame someone for trying.
It's more like 2 hours and 38 minutes
Celestia`s_Bunny: yeah i think thats the ooint :|
Shizuka: I bet that blond chick on the pickup truck is next
*point
Cuz they are children!
I can't stand them anymore!
Sketch_Toku_Brony i mean the money for this movie could of been used for somthing "better"
Shizuka: 100 bits on that douche
beat the shit outta that guard and run in
anypony wanna play tf2 wif me plz? :3
Dat Acting
oni_link: wat are ooints
See, if the Fire Nation hadn't attacked, all of this shit wouldn'tve happened
14Minus the 'quick' thing for me.
Everyone can speak english in this
wait, the monks got a ticket on the ship?
We've come a FUCKING long way
.

Isnt that the same guy who plays the Hong Kong banker in The Dark Knight?
thatll help
Whut will happen?
silly woman
00,10mother your guilttrips dont work on me I am 44 years old
Celestia`s_Bunny: twas a typo, I meant point
WE'VE COME FROM CAMELOT, AND WE'RE ON THE WAY TO RECOVER THE HOLY GRAIL
oh hey its the mobster from Dark Knight
Sumica: No, Sumica. Even at 44, your mom's guilt trips will ALWAYS work.
I'll blame them for not doing something else, first.

For great justice!
brony2447 2012
'before the world ends, i just wanna say that Rainbow Dash is the best pony
Lavos gonna eat the world
04Anton?
i'm amazed the workers dont riot
Yeah but it would be uncomfortable to live in.
05,15Big_macinsocks not really, too many more and it'll be overcrowded and the project would have been for nothing
00,03brony2447: 2012, A simulation on what's going to happen to us.
It's been estimated that a human population of less than 300 would not make for a stable gene pool.
Surly to fix ark 3 you seal off all bulkheads around the hull breach and luach anyway?
05,15The cold truth is you can't save everyone
Celestia`s_Bunny: Oh yes. Punctuation and spelling are such a treat.
04Well, I guess he does look a bit like Anton if he was like 20 years older and fatter

05,15You HAVE to make sacrifices
CCCP: oh lol... i hate this movie.. thx anyway
are they gign to go o nteh ocean or space?
13question
movie I am disappoint
This is crazy!
They are arc reactors.
I was promised space ships. SPACE SHIPS
yes Shizuka
13they put the arks out onto these anchors to survive the initial blast of the wave
Space anchors so they can stop and anchor themselves to....space
00,10for the horde
Nice lookin boats
13why not just anchor inside, keep more of the water away
You were never promised space ships.
fluttercry: that one guy said the ycould fit 10 peopleinto his single room
this movie is entertaining i'll admit
O__O
14Oh God why am I on Horseland.
They're not Spaceships, they're arks
11,01It's experience, Lyra`.
I thought we go to space.
MOVIE TURNED INTO HALO!!!!!!!
I'm glad they chose to base the launch site in China, known for it's geographic stability, thus making it the last place to get hit by these earthquakes
inb4 fire turrets
in space, every liter of oxygen and water is precious. a ship is a closed ecosystem. overload that systema nd it collapses
and this movie was the prequal to Waterworld
PANIC.
not the bag
Because the movie script didn't call for that to happen.
fuck
alas, when this happens for real... celestia will come and make the land pretty and turn us into ponies
Well they're fucked.
nuuuuuu not the bag, you must go get it!
THAT SCREAM
STOP.\

If the world ends we'll probably all die.

no shit sherlock
It's an Ark.

AGain he has a point.

XylemTube: was that a Louis CK reference
1 DRAGONBALL Z MINUTE FOR NAMEK TO EXPLODE

1 minute left of the mission D:>
Oh God BEEES
/me gets out a radio and plays The Smile Song
NOT THE BEES.
Those arcs seem pretty well designed for last minuite rush job.
13there's 30 seconds right there
00,10they been making them for 3 years
dbz min is best min
COWER BEFORE THE GIANT WAVE!
13aaaand the other 30 seconds
Brace yourselves. Water is coming.
my god
30 seconds left of the mission....
Shizuka: get it? the President said: Who are these kids, and i said BEBE'S KIDS
You don't say?
I can just imagine this happening but every brony on earth was then saved by celestia.
Dovah: good ol' namekusei times

13oh never mind

KA ME HA ME HAAAAAAAA
I have a question
Shizuka: longest 30 secs ever
welp
That was actually 1 minute, wow
WHERE ARE THE SEAPONIES!
beeeees
00,10they said one min, they ment it
thath's some pretty impressive fluid simulations going on there
IT'S HERE!
Perfect timing
5.... 4... 3...2...1... YOU FAIL!
glub
13see, it's playing every disaster trope so straight you miss the ones it avoids
ew that sounded like my alarm clock
The timer was a second fast, there.
Thoom.
Randomiser: amazing!
13like having a minute actually mean a minute
Where was Gondor when the wave hit?!

They ded or something?
/me calls upon sea ponies
11,01Mica
08,01uh gues, the water's meant to be on the *outside* of the ship...
13they're too fast
Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress.
00,10they learned noting from titanic
welp GG, couldve been off already
it tracked the back of his head
00,10they have no bulheads
stahp laughing
IM FIRING MAH LAZER!!!!!!1 BLARGGG
must be some software there
looking at this, this technically means that Noah's Ark was a better design than these arks.
They still alive.
oh my
04So now we're in Titanic
Meanwhile, too late for seaponies now.
OH MY............
Nittany_Discord: Nice one. :D
Nice timing on the ping when Dr Helmsley was zoomed in on
CALL UPON THE SEAPONIES!
weren't it 9 seconds?
wait, this movie is over 2 hours long? WTF
It's like Titanic II!
shubidu
When your in distress
99 bottles of beer on the wall...
NO CALL AQUAMAN
He's ded. Did you not see him?
I can say "Oh my" just like him.
00,10we cant go back for gordon with out a spatula and a bucket
99 bottles of beer...
Tenzin? Wheres Drake and Elena :D we need to find the Cinntamani Stone
hehe penetrate
05,15Where's Gordon? Well we need a mop
They obviously didn't call upon seaponies. Shame.
13and then the second door helpfully goes slower
You know, there's a guy who actually wants to make a second Titanic.
NO! I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE------ (Inspector Gadget reference)
not the doggie
THIS PLOT IS NOT WORTH >2 HOURS
SAVE THE DOG
How it's flooding.
CAESAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13and then tamara dies because... why?
Where's Gordon? gumming up the gears on the gate...
Randomnerd, wait, what??? Are you serious??
SAVE THE DOG!!!!!!!!!!!
00,10doors are closed, why still floooding?
She sacrificed her dog for him.
the dog was crushed?
If that isn't tempting fate, I don't know what is.
Drwoning would be aterrible way to go
08,01she ded
13the dog lives
No he's safe.
Sumica: Because......this movie is stupid

05,15Ninja'd
Shizuka: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
this is 2012?
BUT WHAT ABOUT CAESAR?
Sumica: pressure, logic fail?
ThePillowship: YOu didn't know about that?
o9/11
13but she dies because... i dunno the movie didn't rack up enough kills wiping out los angeles i guess
That there is an insult to injury
Teleporter down
oopsie
Another silly movie.
SYMBOLISM
Now that.
04Because everybody knows that dogs are more valuable than humans in these movies
Sumica: I think the back door is not closed
AJIsAwesome, no I didn't.
The heck is going on?
is fucking scary.
08,01SURFIN USA
Air Force One 'aint got time for your shit.

Shizuka: BUT WHAT ABOUT CAESAR!?
airforce one is overrated
00,10they could have planned that airfield better
why dont they have seatbelts?
Ah.
SURFS UP BRAH
U.S.A in Style
YAY
I think I'll request Air Force One for a B movie sometime
They were not prepared for that.

Pretty hefty design flaw, there
Scoot-Scootaloo, this is Chinese-made
Scoot-Scootaloo: it was made by china
ABAJ!
Scoot-Scootaloo that doesnt make any sense
surf
perfect planning there
Shizuka: oh, i get it :D That's what they get for turning L&O to shit
That was sooon Titanic
who hired fatty?
WHEEE!
13can't start the engine til the gate is closed, don't even have the foresight to install a standard disaster movie override button
I think he's talking about the ship.
Time for some hardcore white water rafting
Why would you build it so you can't start the engines till the gate's closed? Why?
oh the drama
I hate how this was an A movie....
And we can't close the gate until we start the engine.
08,01wub wub
Nothing made by the damn Chinese ever worked, not even their space arks.
This ride sucks! :[
00,10and again, what is point of presure doors

Yes Canada has a thanksgiving. It is in early October
MICA play some ashens
DocSane: I don't hate it I just want to wait
Oh god, I dont know if I want to watch the next movie or play TF2, Scream fortress is now live
I can't help it, I have real trouble not vocalising my problems with people.
Shizuka: yep, just not at the same time
I mean, Meanwhile and I are about the same height, so it's a fair fight.
AlienWarhead: Smart movie.
05,15Canadian Thanksgiving is in October I believe
Well, I guess it's a given that starting with ME, every other installment of Windows is going to be a stinker.
08,01what?
Its pony time
DocSane: Win 8 has too many security flaws at the momemnt, I have allready manged to remotly trigger the hard drive wipe function on a cmputer without needed a password
It was the weekend of the 8th this year
08,01okay everyone, i have a small announcement to make
08,01not related to bronystate

You don't count as people.

Is it about the end of the world

08,01as some of you might know, i'm the chairman of europe's largest brony convention, BUCK
0,14though if I ask her out, he won't have a reason to wok me
See, there he goes again :D
3.1 was good. 95 was good, 98 was good, ME was terrible, XP was good, Vista was terrible, 7 was good, 8 was terrible from the inception.
08,01well, we just had a round of hiring, and i'm pleased to say that we've chosen Chrysalis as our new floor manager
Kandarihu: vista i s ok after update 2, which is what i have
When Adrian arrives at the copper mine near the start of the movie, the car hits a puddle and capsizes a toy boat. This is foreshadowing for the capsizing of the boat on which Adrian's father works.
But I'm not european, so...
SaxyPretender: Ask WHO out? :3
nice
They have given me power

Well... hold on.

SaxyPretender: just ask her
Phase4 Tf2, SS3 and portal for linux,are you happy ?
Is she interested in you, Saxy?
SaxyPretender, tell her that youre not interested in her, but keep flirting with her, it'll totally fuck with her mind :D
It's a great idea, Tassadork
Aw, this movie is fictional!
08,01Tassadork: well, you know how fond i am of changelings...
To be honest though, I'm a bit too paranoid to trust Windows 100%. I've been wanting to go Linux for security reasons alone.
She might be waiting for you to take the initiative.

This would be way funnier if Shining Armor got the poison joke

Sumica, you were the one that used to play Amnesia on stream, right?
woble woble
Dear Princess Celestia... I didn't learn anything!... No... Seriously. I didn't... :(
no one said she couldn't use magic!
Shizuka: super cider squeezy 6000s lesson is a callback, not direct but it is

Dashie_Dashie: full of ponies?
13the continuity in this show wants to be more consistent but at times it approaches dexter's lab levels of discontinuity
Adorkable. <3
wat, no horn jokes?
not enought viagra?
Red sand or actually red?
AlienWarhead: Singing Armor, all he could do is speak in song?
You're usuing your horn right now. :D
o there it is
red sand~
or magic?
AlienWarhead, I've been having alot of pony dreams lately.
@_@
I'm back again............And 2012 ended, but i will play my take on it later

A purse!

Dashie_Dashie, you took the blue acid then.
13she ate some of those paper dots
AlienWarhead: Oh.
I asked for the news, not the weather
05,15The discontinuity actually makes me upset. Seeing as the whole point is that they're supposed to learn lessons
and maybe she wasn't using magic the whole episode because you don't know what would happen!
Rev: I just write to much fics.
Dashie_Dashie: I've had a couple of them
:p
Thats not a bad deal at all
RD, why do you even try?
supernatural could refer to magic as it is not magic, and coming from Twilight, the element of MAGIC, that is kinda... hypocritical dont you think?
Headshot!
Shizuka: LIKE the time Dexter said he hates Burritos, and in the next, he eats a BIG ONE
05,15which the immediately ignore the very next episode

I like Rarity's mane like that
flutterguy's adorable
DocSane: none. they wanted to get someone who spoke swahili, but couldnt find any
i think they should bring flutterguy back in season 3
Because I'm not too fond of the idea of Win 8 being on something that's not a touch-screen or all-in-one computer.
