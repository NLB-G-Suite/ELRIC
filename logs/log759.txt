Abuse of trust in an authority.
11,02D:
If you can't take a joke, you shouldn't be on the internets.
Admins are authorities, no matter how silly or anything else the channel.
Pfft. We're not a business.
But RashWithDainbows, we'd lose half the audience.
But you are authorities.
Admns are srs bsns
Some of them are authoritarian, some of them aren't much

Dabi, stop enjoying yourself.
But no one cares.
11,02Except we put on clothes instead of taking them off...cause we're ponies

11,02Ponies are normally naked.

08,01is that immoral for the single person?
no
Saturn: for both in my opinion.
it hurts man ;^;
Saturn: depends if the partner of the married person knows and is ok with it
Saturn its only immoral if you think it is.
its only immoral if the maried persons' spouse disagrees
08,01the way i see it, if the single person is not coercing/bribing/blackmailing the married person, he is not at fault
^
It's not inherently bad to do anything
We've just decided it is
That's slimy.
08,01prince-dari: nihilism! \o/
Around about 50 years ago it would be seen as immoral to be gay/have gay relationships
It's slimy.
08,01those damn gays.
O u Saturn
Now most civilised countries don't think that way any more
it's wrong for the single as well, he should respect the married person's commitment to the partner he had sex with
^
Morals change because they are defined by public opinion, not because anything is inherently good or bad.
like, the one he hasn't had sex with

R34.2 is everything is ponified

00,10ewwww macross 7
Sure it's weird, but it's been a fun series.
00,10could not finish it
00,10hell i could barely start it
I'm starting to think Macross Frontier sort of justified the physics of 7.
What's wrong with Macross 7? I've never heard of it.
^
Then again, I've never heard of Macross either.
I like how when they talk, all they're mouths do is go up and down
00,10macross is more or less robotech

Aw :3
I'm now two episodes from the end of Frontier and I realize now that Global probably made a huge mistake with that colonization project. I've counted 6 fleets that have either been destroyed or last seen still searching for a planet.
"And with THESE HANDS... I hold the fate of MILLIONS!"
And how many successfully colonized worlds? ONE!

oh. it's you again

That is all.
its the anual day where all of the people killed in transphobic attacks are honored and remembered
>transphobic
Ok one moment
the fear of transgendered people
Wrek's streaming.
how can u tell
we already had that

http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3228-LET_GO_OF_YOUR_HAT.jpg
I'm not hating on transgender at all either.
I know :D
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw7939-tumblr_ma5mijxhy51rcjmu8o1_500.gif
we arent different, but people like to treat us like we are :3
/me 08,01sneaks up on Uncouth and stealthily hugs
There is nothing different. You're the same as every person, just with a different persspective.
perspective*
And if people think you're different cause you don't fit their perspective, fuck them.
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw5366_medium.jpg
08,01Jmo: people can observe whatever they want
oh, I have been huged!
me too
They can, but if they're going to observe negative they should keep it to themselves.
hugged*
08,01if i want to observe left-handed pansexual cellist twin day of rememberance, i can
right, hugged :)
just saying
08,01it's their fucking prerogativee
08,01if you don't want to celebrate it, that's yours
08,01but don't be such a drama llama about it
Ded
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1741-1319403477.jpg
Rain: personally, i dont really care for that. i'm not american
08,01</rant>
also its more to raise awareness that it happens
a lot
08,01DPS rogue
i rember the last time you treid to raise awareness. we were aware after the first 5 minutes but you kept on for half an hour. throwing around groundless accusations
Ahahahaha DS
Ikr?
groundless? http://lexiecannes.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/trans-woman-sues-u-s-govt-over-tasering-by-park-ranger/
08,01Meanwhile: i can out-DPS a fair few equal level palies with my rogue
08,01do i mean palies... no, i think i mean mages
yes, groundless. as in accusing people in here for being intolerant fucks for no reason
08,01honestly, it's been ages since i've played WoW
if an accusation is made towards someone without any reason, that is a groundless accusation
08,01Dark_Horst: maybe it's because some people in here are intolerant fucks...
I've tried several times to return to WoW, tis just too boring.
it's also very insulting
Pfft.
no no, I didnt acuse you of being intolerant fucks. I said if a bully is beating someone and you dont even tell someone about it or try to stop it, you are as bad as the bully
probably not
didnt call you intolerant fucks and yes actually.
08,01*if
sorry, but no
I didnt accuse you.
logic does not work that way
you did
This is getting silly.
not today
ok then
08,01oh, another gem: "i think gays should just stick to their own community"; also: "what use are gays to society? they can't reproduce."
how about that?
08,01she also thinks "it" is the appropriate transgender pronoun...
/me shrugs
if it helps, I appologise for the statement I cant remember
08,01i don't know whether to laugh, cry, break shit, or all of the above
08,01yes
it also seems she's repeating the most commonly used phrases
08,01it's really actually starting to get to me
08,01it never really did before
is this Starcraft 2?
it is
Thats the kind of thing this day is trying to bring awareness too
08,01just a simple nervous system that knows how to make curry
08,01take that, darwin.
lol
hope the curry is good at least
anyway, all that woman did to get her face slashed and her throat cut, was exist. which is fucked up
Oh the chieves.
08,01only when she makes it with ingredients that aren't 3 years out of date
08,01and that's just the meat
Rain: sad thing is, you dont even have to be transgender/gay whatever else for this to happen to you. Just be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
yes, but imagine using a public restroom
08,01Alchemist: but being transgender/gay helps
just being afraid to go to the bathroom, or walk down the street
yeah
08,01there's a reason why it's called gender dysphoria.
the attempt rate is 41% of the trans population
08,01i mean, being trans is a dificult lifestyle choice
08,01just like AIDS.
which means its not a choice
08,01Alchemist: that was a reductio ad absurdum comment
08,01ah, okay
08,01Lil_B: next time i'm on the phone to their booking manager, i'll mention it
thanks :P
oh, found that link
08,01Rain: pm it me first
i think he only has 89ish energy
watching stream instead of studying is sooo satisfying right now.
but it wont be for much longer...

You're gonna get robbed.
something: I didnt have much either, they stil managed to steal my shoes :D
I remember seeing a tag on a piece of luggage that said "Nothing worth stealing here"
Knowing how assholish the people of america are....not much
Maybe put another tag inside that reads "Told ya!"
Heheh
I said it can be boring and besides, some letsplays make it interesting to watch
hello
Whoops
Multi kill!
it is quiet this afternoon
I dont know why but this kind of gameplay doesnt really seem to interest me that much
is now, was a tad more active a little while ago

Besides I like ponies but streaming nothing but that might get tiresome after a while

Hello everypony!
One Bad Apple is the Episodes name? I expect Touhou Music
I dun get it
watch touhou "bad apple"
probably not
/me is sad :(
OOH S2E11
oh please
/me kids today
HOW DOES THAT WORK
if*
I think it was 1000 years ago.
I.e. Celestia had a REALLY busy year a millennium ago.
^
If you want to push it:
There you go, fanfic-ish explanation.
Oh no.
A logical flaw in a cartoon for children? :P
^
All right, here's another explanation.
If it was EXACTLY 1000 years to the day on the season premiere?
52 min till launch
Not even marauders match my accent!
maybe it was 999 years ago?
Then Luna was banished a little later.
Just say "okay, a thousand years, give or take a decade"
There you go, plot hole insulant applied.
Plot hole!
*t
Does take away from the significance of the 1000 years PRECISELY, but whatever.
or 1001
I mean, really, it's a plothole that is designed to be filled up by approximately 5000 fanfic-writers. Done.
I'd call it 'overthinking it. Massively.'
But then, I'm a cynic.
No it's not.
But a millennium ago is fine if it's about 900-1100 years ago.
Neat.
Then they contradicted themselves, or Celestia's memory's a bit foggy. She HAS been alive for at least a millennium, probably several.
dafuw
gah
hello hi AHOY!
Discord...somewhere inbetween maybe
oh my gawd it's star craft!!!!~~~!
is dat sum star craft? :P
yea
Going by all of this, I think '1000 years' is not THAT overused.
xD
We've had four 'major villains'. Yes, 50% could be argued, but really, on a focus group of four, that doesn't really make much of a point. :P
it cant rly
Yea...Discord,Luna and Celestia are mentioned no where in that story at all
I think I missed that ep
Hiya.
It happens, yes, but meh.
44 :D
Wait a second.
yo canary
Evening everbrony.
mmhmm
lool
robo fetish xD
lol
O U
Yeah, but asking for specifics in this thing is really, it seems, our thing. The cartoon itself couldn't really care less, I rather suspect. :P
I got the best theory to explain it all: it's a kid's show
I heard the orig planetside was kinda disappointing
I know its just a show but it still seem slike a massive contradiction to the whole story
Yes, but we've got about three tidbits of 'overarching story', to be fair.
90% of it is standalone.
Wait... Deacon= Dken?!
Thats his way of saying hello
:O Oh!
she'S pretty
actually planetside got an 81 on metacritic, thats not toooo bad
robo and alien fetish***
ign gave it 77 :/
>caring about IGN reviews.
I stopped listening to IGN's bullshit a long time ago.
well maxim gave it a 100
ever
Listen to Zero Punctuation.
If it isnt Call of Duty it sucks, is their viewpoint
not even he's right
IGN ... I never visit that site unless I wanna read about Secreats or Walkthroughts
IGN review things? I thought they sold ratings.
Oh discussion about money eating reviewers.
Woo.
You've got mail!
Reviews shouldnt dictate how you play.
That's my opinion, anyway
They are interesting when it comes to REALLY BAD games, etc.
Loading why are we still loading
loading an loading files
/me giggles.
because it didn't even work for like 50% of the players
SHHHHH
Oh yes I do.
Captian Mcgolden nipples
FANBOYYYYY
Alongside the logo of the Eggman Empire, of course.
"The Eggman Empire - Get a load of this!"

Just another boring tuesday
still? aww.
It didn't even get past the splash screen to me, never got to boot it up
is there any lottery survey up yet? Said it's up Monday-Thursday, but nothing yet
As am I, but I"m a git. :P
aah
I guess it's not up then - I was simply curious if it wasn't showing for me :-)
Yeah I read about it while trying to fix it, missing actions <,< buugs--oh my
Heh.
:P
Egg emperor was in Generations actually
Catechumen
Well the 3ds version anyway....

Here.
Prepare for a massive image.

The Egg Emprerror also was in Heroes... which I actually liked...
It's just icky
It's a tad more impressive than the Egg Emperor, I feel :P
Yes..
yeah-
I just linked to that image, saying "look carefully, you MIGHT find me in there."
"hard and fast"
Which one was that? I didn't play the 3DS one.
Am i the only one around here?
That IS sort of silly.
And... well, most other ones.
It's as if people WANT to be taken over.
Shame it was self-defeating. :P

Country, or city in USA?
Does it matter?
if you choose something really far away, it might be slower, but yeah, that's about it I guess
Heya everbrony
Hiya
*Sonny

sorry :$
Yeeeeah, this download is going to take awhile for me :(
hehe
/me is a derp 6_9
I'll probably buy planetside too, maybe- some of my friends praised it
Its live now, lol
yeah, but I might wait until the weekend

Its F2P tho :o
^

05but yeah
05facign 20 years for taking photographs is beyond ridiculus
it's a common law
brb going to area 51
u know em?
arma3 developers
Probably on the news
dem hippies
ofcourse it's way too harsh with 20 years, but smashing their cameras and shipping them out? That would make sense
It's optional.
i could understand a hefty fine 2 but ya any long jail time is dumb
especially in this case
jail time would make sense if they were employed by another country, as spies,
but they weren't
/me is glomped.
Oi
heya, hows you?
:)
:3
Just about every variation of download is fussy atm.
If only I could get Planetside 2 to work on my laptop >w<
>_>*
You do know they are guilty of espionage in some degree, right?
They probably do
I can't imagine a country that would let you take pictures of their army bases
=__=
I mean, 20 years is too much when they're not actually spies, but noone would let you leave with the camera
Why were they taking photos to begin with?
Hmm
then they said it was a vacation
is it a military prison or maxium or low security
no idea~~
camera?
They had a camera, that's enough
taking picture of 'secret bases' or military things, is illegal
they took pictures, they were arrested
hmm no stream
Well if it was illegal why did they do it in the first place?
05there are bases close to the airports in geece even
05and you are likely to snap a jetfighter in the backround
Huh.
huh
Weird.
then changed their story after arrest
05as i said
05its muddy
yeah-
^
Well even if they don't willingly release these guys, we can't expect this situation to be anything remotely the same 20 years from now.
And if these guys were monitoring them the moment they got on the island, why didnt they stop them then?
like--myanmar
and china-
Maybe that'll solve their issues.
05pfft
I think it's fine, army should be allowed to censor air-iamges
05they're broke
Last I heard they are bankrupt
and that does not change anything
Alright.
05jsut saying
05and start with iCheese
Hehehe
Even if it is illegeal, you wouldent get shit out of the event
05iGoat
Still illegal
05and OLiVE
-.(\
soon, iEurope
OOPAH!
probably not
If they did it's not likely to be common knowledge is it.
AWw Yeah, next after that? iMoon
There probably ar spies in every country
Or maybe iTwinkies. Oh wait.
iHorse and iHuman
05irobot
05OMG
08,01I DID NAAAAAAAAAT
05it onyl first now struck me that iRobot is an apple reference
....
Suuuuure
DUN DUN DUN
iRobot?
08,01iRobot?
05the movie?
/me makes a cricket noise
no
damn guys
05but still
Yeah the movie is based on the book, which was around before apple.
....
05that doesnt matter really
^
08,01Wrek: you know it was "based" on an Asimov book from 1950, right?
08,01of the same name
05venus
05im jsut sayin
05that whoever made that cover
05for the bluray
08,01ah, i see it now
Oooooh
08,01i've never seen the film
08,01because i'm one of the world's biggest asimov fans
05i know its and movie of a book of a something
Bc it's actually a pretty good movie
05that wasnt
05waht i was "questioning" as it were
05udnerstandable saturn
05but its still a good movie ^_^
same- actually
LoTR too
The IRobot movie didnt do the books any justice imo.
Wumbo
Changing planets are we?
1...2...
3...
05bilbo was probably my first voluntary read
Ooh~~
05so with the movie close
05ermegerd
Well, LoTR movies did, in most cases, do the book justice- hopefully same can be said for the hobbit
05right
hoepfully
05the titled it the hobbit
ive seen a summery for the hobbit. its was meh
05not bilbo
Hobbiten it was called in Norwegian, the book
05w/e
It is a 3 parter
seems unnecessarily long
perhaps, it is a massive journey- we'll see
Simlarilion?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: In A Tavern, Down By The River
yeah
look at his track-record of splatter movies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGF5ROpjRAU - this? :)
Silmarillion O__O Five times smaller than the Lord of the Rings, ten times more complicated to read
it sema like there is no stream
this must be fixedc
oh Lord, I tried to read Silmarillion, it was like reading the appendix in LoTR
05that i can guarantee
05if its me streamign or not
05maybe
I would settle with listening to this for 3 hours in a theatre http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-1RPDqJAY
now I imagine it to be a tiny trickle of water-
05only 60%
I'll be back folks. I want to get this download done ASAP.
i'm at 40%
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hmDZz5pDOQ Best intermission music hands down
i just went WTF and turned it off
It's a kiss on the cheek, I think
Kiss greeting, seen that many times
