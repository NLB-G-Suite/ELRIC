I thought Adam licked people.

Hold on I thought I started the stabbing!
I thought I did .-.
Adam licks then stabs gives out tetanus via rusty kitchen knife to the chat
/me violently stabs Socks with a rusty kitchen knife .-.

^See?
cfirst he licks people to let them think they are safe, then he stabs the,

Balloon race. That always was an annoying map.
Invi: :D
So we have a kidnapper, two stabbers, a few chat killers, a pillow thing and everyone else
Lively bunch, aren't we?
Yep.

All you need is a boat and a flag and you're practically pirates.
bacon. that is all i have to say to that
And add jellybeans to the pillow thing.
Jellybeans?
/me stabs AssaultWithEmbraces affectionately
yes. Jellybeans AAAAUGH MY SIDES!
Hey why does the stream screen looked cracked from top to side there?
S'probably a glitch in the streaming software.
oh
Meanwhile, why u called Meanwhile?
Or something to do with a window.
Why're you called Socks?
hi
Hi, CCCP. :)
/me stabhugs CCCP
hi AJIsAwesome and Socks
Dammit Socks!
Meanwhile: Because it was the name of a gnome that lives in my head :)
Socks Blocks
/me takes away all the sharp objects in from the chat
Socks: Meanwhile was the first word that came to mind when I was picking a name.
Good enough reason :D

Can't stand having the dings on damage enabled.
<.<
Meanwhile, even if the dings were Pinkie saying "Honk!"?
^
That'd be even worse.
then it must be
Any time I went heavy or pyro it'd be nothing but "Honkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonkhonk"
hmm
That'd get on my nerves.
^
true.
I liked having a dispenser radio.
especially one that plays pony songs
Mmm yes..
mmmmmmmmmbananas
What if you replaced the dings with Pinkie saying "Fun"?
Oi, don't start the mmmmmm
hi weeping_pegasi82
stop starting
Mmmmmmmmmmmm.
AdamTheDuck, dear god.
hey CCCP
AdamTheDuck: It'd be like watching the episode on repeat.
Why can't it be the "Mine"
Surgery, hmm yes?
harumph
Does it seem to anyone else that the Engineer is the most popular class?
Engineer is popular with people who don't like having to move.
hey, I don't like moving
8-bit Parasprite Polka while firing Sasha or natasha.
Not for playing, I meant as in general.
In terms of personality?
I guess it's true that Valve has worked hard to make sure that none of the classes are overtly the most popular of all of them
I always found the Medic/Pyro the most popular class besides the Engineer.
Second class I played was Engineer.
This is one interesting map
Well the engi's a good natured chap with a nice voice and an amusing accent.
hai
ohai
It's hard not to passively like him.
Hi Brony
Meanwhile: Agreed.
why are ppl here?
Because it's fun here?
because we can be
Why are people anywhere?
What kind of question is that. -_^
Because ponies are gay Brony.
because
ah, existenitanalism
AdamTheDuck, no they aren't
*probably made up that word*
Yeah, ponies are for little girls >_>
Bye guys :)
or if I didn't spelled it wrong
Bye, Socks. :)
Imagine if grown men watched My Little Pony <_<
bye Socks
Bye Socks
adamtheduck your gay
/me hugs all the chat
you're*
Yeah I know I'm happeh :>
ah, I put too many n's and a's in it
AdamTheDuck, you know that trolling is against the rules here, right?
Favorite map is the Mario Kart map.
and not enough i's
Kandarihu, take it as a light joke. .-.
hi
It's not like I actually hate ponies. >.>
Hello aniderp
Hi, aniderp.
Trolling is against the rules. Unless you're a mod
Then it's a requirement
<:
^^
oh dabi
AdamtheDuck lol if you say ponines are for little girl why are you here
Dabi pls.
AdamTheDuck, why? Because you wanna get away with it?
>.>
princess dairy is all powerfull overlord
*powerful
:|
Why is the internet so srs?
gah, forgot how to spell
Srs bsns.
AdamTheDuck, because you broke a clearly established rule.
Kandarihu: we do that all the time
Kandarihu: You cuold let mods deal with it if they think he's broken a rule
=.=
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kANUpUjsYgc&feature=related
annnnnd there you go.
Brony: No vid links during stream.
@_x
Lol.
.....
Kurra: ?
am tired, barely did anything today. *flump*
Brony: You should read through our rules page
05aaaah
And FAQ page. :)
well that was a good nap
05THIS IS GREAT
Brony: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
yes, so you can break the rules, but know you did it
05too abd it isnt planetside though xD
also, is REALLY disheartening when an admin says that trolling is required if you're an admin. :/
There was a better way to approach this that I should've tried instead.
Not long now Wrek.
BrownieStaet is srs bsns
Kurra: apparently you've never seen dari on chat before
dat lag screan
Kurra, I'd be disheartened by that if not for the way that Sumica and ValtheJean trolls us.
Kurra: Well if you're in distrestt, you could call up on the sea ponies.
I have, and I've been hoping that he is kidding... :/
that too
distress*
Shoo be doo shoo shoo be doo
Call upon the sea ponies when you're in distress~
Kandarihu: that's meant to be trolling?
Half of the mods troll us with pre-G4 ponies, and that's a harmless way to troll us.
Helpful as can be ponies simply signal S.O.S
If you find you're cast adrift, and haven't got an oar (OAR)
minecraft
It's Bacon and Applejack!
Call upon the sea ponies they'll see you to shore~
But what if you're in the middle of a desert? Seaponies can't swim in sand.
>IRC
Admins can be very.... I can't think of the right word :/

Does that seriously upset you Kurra?
Ohai NewSuperBronyU :P

Hey NewSuperBronyU, still playing your WiiU?

Why does it matter?
....
But dari, think of his feelings. D:
Pfft.
xD
Some things still matter to *some* people.
Haha
Feelings? .-.
Meanwhile will now cry himself to sleep
What be this feelings?
Feelings? whats that?
Because I kicked him on IRC
getting made an example of is fun
Why are you so mean to meeeeeeee.
11,02I had to step aside and cry out my feelings before joining back ;~;
Awww
How could this happen to meeeeeeeee
NewSuperBronyU: I can believe that
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU

/me hugs AdamTheDuck back
O meanwhile, u punk kid u
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU "i know that feel" ;~;
I am good spy :3
There are certain levels of trolling. In general, it can be divided in to pranking and bullying.
RashWithDainbows pls, I can see you.
DashWithRainbows: >.> when did you get here
MF2?
I've been here for hours, cowvarkian.
11,02I thought prince-prince dari, he I-I-I thought he liked me, but-but now he thinks I'm not cooool ;A;
Always lurking.
DashWithRainbows: cool
Kandarihu, there is Dashological pranking and then there is plain being mean.
Unless I'm at college.
DashWithRainbows: collage
essbee pls
And then chat is getting into serious discussion
WHAT'S HAPPENING??
AssaultWithEmbraces: srs bizns
Is serious discussion prohibited?
You must know that even though I kick you, and insult you...
AssaultWithEmbraces: What's wrong with serious discussion? :<
Well
AssaultWithEmbraces, browniestaet is srs bsns
I...
Super please, no one thinks you're cool. :3
Nope.
Never really liked you anyway

/me uses a Phoenix Down on SB ;~;
Gonna keep goin',
But yeah, Kurra, I don't see how a kick on IRC hurts anyone
/me 9999
DUDE
Kurra, yeah. Yeah! And there's nothing wrong with pranking as long as it remains harmless. Bullying is never the right thing to do.
You can rejoin the chat straight away
IT GIVES THEM BUTTHURT DISEASE
cowvarkian, grave robber!
It isn't who it hurts, it's what the action represents.
The deadliest of diseases.
AssaultWithEmbraces: thank you!
you're so nice
11,02d00d
The action represents your posterior pummelling.
Which is what? The extreme corruption and abuse of power? :P
Silly cowvarkian, I'm the nicest person here.
Oh my
This song is nice
Abuse of trust in an authority.

Here comes the Nom Monster!
DashWithRainbows, ^^^

Admins are authorities, no matter how silly or anything else the channel.
Pfft. We're not a business.
But RashWithDainbows, we'd lose half the audience.
But you are authorities.
Admns are srs bsns
An internet authority.
We'd have more Eman's in here, Meanwhile.
Some of them are authoritarian, some of them aren't much
11,02We're a porn site. Porn sites are not businesses, they are social experiences.
Dabi, stop enjoying yourself.
NewSuperBronyU: :S
NewSuperBronyU: hmm
NewSuperBronyU Cooool
But no one cares.
NewSuperBronyU, wat
NewSuperBronyU: wut?
AssaultWithEmbraces: yeah, this is totally porn
You can't be a porn site, if boobs appear on the streamer the streamer gets hammered.
11,02Except we put on clothes instead of taking them off...cause we're ponies
the stream the streamer*
11,02Ponies are normally naked.
NewSuperBronyU: >Implying everyone here is a pony
:L
Is porn good or bad for youth?
Meanwhile: hah
Meanwhile: I see what you actually typed there
11,02Well...this site is for ponies only...
Kurra: You seem to be one of those people that makes the internet out to be 'srs bsns'
When was the last time you saw an animal wearing clothes, pets excluded.
AssaultWithEmbraces: last tuesday
05i like these songs :3
Last month I saw an Alpaca wearing a fedora, if that coutns.
counts*
Wrek: norly
hey guys
Wrek, What is this song?
It's not the internet I take serious. It's the actions individuals take, and what they mean.
Meanwhile: Was it fabulous~
AssaultWithEmbraces i see all these humans wearing clothes
Meanwhile, an alpaca....wearing a fedora....?
AJIsAwesome: It gobbed on the floor, so not really.
CCCP, humans and pets exluded
Kurra: how do you know we're not all a computer
11,02i liek Wrek :3
Kurra: we could be some blob living on a planet lightyears away
But because memes say srs b'ness, and because it more easy than it is right to do what's popular, I'll get shooed off. :/
What WAS that? :S
while i eat your brain
Was that what I thought it was? :S
AJIsAwesome, it was a finger
Nice play list Wrek
AssaultWithEmbraces: you're a finger
ARGH also why do I miss writing words >_O
cowvarkian, nou
ok
AssaultWithEmbraces: What was it doing?
I liked this place. :(
hi Blackalpha
hi
whats up
Wrek that spray is...I don't even know.
^
Kurra: from what I can tell, nothing's changed
What, so as an admin I'm not allowed to joke around with people in the chat? I should just be the paradigm of totalitarianism?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Okay everyone, calm down?
princess dairy, apparently so
11,02We rule with an iron fist. No fun allowed.
dari you couldn't do that if you tried. Someone'll mention Matt Smith.
take on me?
Pfft
Matt Smith.
NewSuperBronyU: a topaz fist would be more effective
Nah, do joke, just... it's a really bad thing when jokes are made through kicks and bans.
Wouldn't joke about that Super, some people think that's how the place works as it is.
11,02Anyone who sees someone else having fun is required to report them at once. They are criminals.
Meanwhile: what kind of idiot thinks that?
/me leaves *pop*
Hard Times taught me otherwise.
NewSuperBronyU, oh look I'm having fuun! Youuuu can't get meeeeee!
Most boring book ever written.
NewSuperBronyU: Couldn't they just lie and get away with it?
11,02FUN ALARM ACTIVATED
/me runs around distributing pillows
D:
NOT THE PILLOWS!
NewSuperBronyU: what fun, I see no fun
They're nice and fluffy!
Who ever said that fun is against any sort of rule? It's only a problem when it's fun at somepony else's expense
I hope you learned your lesson. Stop enjoying yourself.
Kandarihu: we're being facetious
NewSuperBronyU :3
Why can't you be a good law abiding citizen and sit quietly in silence like everyone else. >:I
okay.
Meanwhile: ._.
/me huggles AssaultWithEmbraces :3
Meanwhile: Because sitting's boring? :3
/me huggles NewSuperBronyU
Boring is good!
Boring is the only way to live!
I don't think I've ever seen an IRC room where joke kicks don't happen every so often
Ooh, Wrek has become Rainbow Dash, I think.
Here, read the Dictionary.
It's just a staple of IRC
11,02Meanwhile: Now I know why you hate Nintendo...
Going to to a book burning tomorrow what should i bring?
AssaultWithEmbraces: Sorry if I ask again, but what was that pony doing?
I've been in a place where they don't happen.
anyway.
CCCP: an assault weapon, to kill all of those hicks?
Super: Because it's rehashed garbage for 12 year olds and housewives.
AJIsAwesome, there was a finger in the pony's mouth and it looks suggestive from a distance.
But it's really not
I thought I was clear on that already.
:/
AssaultWithEmbraces: Oh. :S
Like doing pixel/dot art
cowvarkian but then i would hurt them :C
11,02But you like boring? You therefore like Nintendo by that logic?
You're having fun AssaultWithEmbraces you have no opinion.
CCCP: that's the point
Super I'm following your example! I'm trying to ruin peoples fun.
Meanwhile, squige.
13i like how we're actively trying to drive people away now
well duh, nintendo havnt done anything new in years
Shizuka: ikr
So i noticed
:L
I like my opinions.
Chrysalis: I'm pretty sure they have
like what
CCCP: I do
Example: Dumbledore is awesome
Ah you don't need to try, it's working slowly but surely anyway.
Chrysalis: gimme a second
11,02Natural selection. I naturally select people to just go.
I try, shame it doesn't work more often. :P
lol.
I have another opinion: I think ponies are awesome!
AssaultWithEmbraces, ewwwww
Shhh, opinions are against the rules.
/me slaps AssaultWithEmbraces around a bit with a large trout
11,02Let's talk about Wii U now!
Pfft no.
/me gives everyone a big hug

Or was that otakon shipping?

That was otakon shipping.
otakon shipping is still kicking in believe
Ah
RaveBrony: I still haven't gotten kicked for otakon shipping
NewSuperBronyU, no it's MinecraftState :3
Because otakon has this habit of getting very angry very easily.

It's not possible to recreate the crazy of Scientology without taking it seriously.
I don't even acknowledge it.
I just go "Huh" and continue listening to my music
CCCP: i got something similar to that, it's called Jarritos :P
AssaultWithEmbraces what if you werent listening to music in the first place?
CCCP: then he stabs the person
thelonepony lol wut
05im doing ratehr well thsi game :D
So we've noticed.
CCCP, then I'll just start listening to music
AssaultWithEmbraces fair enough
CCCP: you were being facetious about the book burning, right
Din hand. Din fot.
Mmmmm
Is this a hard rock version of songs Wrek?
I'm a bumblebee
cowvarkian i wouldn't go to one of thoughs
Buzz buzz sting sting pollinate die

CCCP: how would I know, and also tone isn't conveyed over text
AssaultWithEmbraces: bees only have one sting
cowvarkian, well just remove a sting and continue
cowvarkian: he said bumblebee
Dark_Horst, she
she
cowvarkian thats just because you arnt a tree
Dark_Horst: apparently I don't know how bumblees work then
cowvarkian: bitches fly solo and sting whenever the fuck they want
haf one sting me once. hurt like fuck
Dark_Horst: coolio
about the first part
I've never held a butterfly before.
05lets listen to somethign calmer
AssaultWithEmbraces: that's totally relevant to something
og well, appearantly bumblebees have hives too

Hi

Hi ekips :)
Hai ekips :)
aand there's my ping
herro everypony
Hi cratorkid :)
Hi, ekips and cratorkid. :
*:)
hey thelonepony and AJIsAwesome
hi ekips
Hai cratorkid :)
:(
08,01okay, question
?
yes?
okay shoot
go for it
/me shoots thelonepony :3
here we go... ( ;) )
/me dies
D:
nuuuu ;~;
the anticipation!
Brovakiin? Why? ;~;
AJIsAwesome: he told me to ;~;
/me had no extra lives
Not LITERALLY! ;~:
/me hands thelonepony a 1-UP
sorry! ;~;
08,01so suppose single sleeps with a married person who is in a monogamous relationship, and both have gone in knowing this
08,01is that immoral for the single person?
why you shoot MLP_Brovakiin ;~;
thelonepony: you told me to :c
no
it hurts man ;^;
/me huggles thelonepony "Sorry" :c
I agree with Eli.
its only immoral if the maried persons' spouse disagrees
08,01Eli: nope
CCCP: that's bull. could i kill you just because i think its not immoral?
Eli: you could, but the law decideds what to do, regardles of morals
Eli im not saying i think its right but morals are for the weak
08,01the way i see it, if the single person is not coercing/bribing/blackmailing the married person, he is not at fault
^
CCCP: are you one of this funny anarchists?
Eli: Morality comes from what is socially acceptable
08,01he is a third party to the relationship; it's the married person's responsibility to stay within the bounds of their relationship
It's not inherently bad to do anything
Eli: anarchy is the best
We've just decided it is
So despite being aware that it's a married person, they did it anyway?
Eli i was joking i dont like anarchy or freedom
That's slimy.
morality is not about who is "at fault"
Eli: Let me give you an example then
08,01well, i'm not arguing the morality of it; i just want to see your views on it
Around about 50 years ago it would be seen as immoral to be gay/have gay relationships
It's slimy.
Eli you just agreed with my first statement
08,01those damn gays.
Now most civilised countries don't think that way any more
it's wrong for the single as well, he should respect the married person's commitment to the partner he had sex with
^
CCCP: to a certain degree yes.
Morals change because they are defined by public opinion, not because anything is inherently good or bad.
bicyclerepairman: that sums it up i guess
bicyclerepairman: if he agrees to screw around there wasnt that much of a commitment to begin with...
to cratorkid... anarchy? really? it's just plain stupid
I'm talking about the other one, Alchemist
ohai everypony :)
like, the one he hasn't had sex with
hi Michael
Hi, Michael. :)

Eli: they did a great job with the tron soundtrack, and while i do agree that it isnt nearly the perfect form of government, but what i would like to see come into view, a minarchist society might be more controled then total anarchy

Saxy.
THIS IS ILLEGAL, YOU KNOW
SMASH!
Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
...exactly
What scale i this?
*is
the bullshit scale
Celsius
I think
Yeah, i'll get a good gaming PC and a wii U
00,10hope they stood up when they pulled that number out of their ass
I just had some Nutella
snow?
doesnt matter what scale, its way below absolute zero
did she blow herself up again?
and on that day,there was 20 years of no summer..spring..fall or anything..just winter
Holy jesus it. Is. DELICIOUS.
is she nude in space....
00,10so cold she also went back in time
yes
Ice.
Ice everywhere.
Dat logic Sumica
thing is, celsius only goes down to -273.15
DerpyMuffins: You can't reach lower temp. than -273C; it's not physically possible
any colder is not physically possible
wait if space is already coldand you make space even colder..what happens
2cold4u
Sorry, guys, kinda went AFK for awhile, what did I miss? Anymore Bewbs, Bots, or 'Splosions?
BEST space dust ever
It's anime logic
Ponies47: you cant
no, not all anime is This bad..
Dark_Horst, Hmmmmm?
oh, right *-273.15, my bad
well nyra she did a ice attack that was 100till degree celcius

twilight_sprinkle :3
CCCP: porn with explosion and physical impossibilities
00,10good thing it'
00,10a space station
so yeah, heat is created by vibration of atoms. -273.15 celsius is the absolute zero point. no movement. you cant get any less movement than no movememnt
twilight_sprinkle sounds awesome :D
Hello all you sexy ponies
Hi Major :)
But seriously what is this shows name?
which is 0 kelvin, btw
Hi Major
Hey Major
Dark_Horst: unless some anti-movement bullshit or idk, since its relative to movement theoretically with some immense bullshit you could probably come up with a phantasy to make it below
yay im learning !
Dark_Horst: Maybe that's why she travelled in time; particles were moving backwards:D
Dark_Horst: NEGATIVE movement :o
Whats the name!
Nyra: he spoke earlier today
I must know!
yeah.... i really doubt that can work in any way
Potato
Oh but how earlier?
yeah, me too
CCCP: Diebuster.
negative movement would be movement again. and get warm
woot
Hi
DONT MISS IT!
Flaria thank you
Dark_Horst: if it were simple movement then yeah, but maybe some antimatter movement or idfk. boobs.
Nyra: i think at 12:45 at my time
BTW: What kind of particles were Tachyons suppose to be?
and agian i greet bronystate from Vegas
No porblem~
problem*
Oh yea, thats right, he's UK isnt he?

If you guys are balking at negative 10 gazillion temp scale, the last few episodes, are really going to bend your brains ...

00,10mine
Nyra, Sumica's OC R63'd
LOL.
magic, magnets and a little bit of plot conveniance
retrospection!
SPACE
THE FINAL FRONTIER
You should see Wrek's R34 of Sumica OC
UNLESS YOUR IN JAPAN
Curious, Sumica. Dont take offence, are you a woman? I simply assume because of female OC.
doggy?
IN WHICH CASE EVERYONES IN SOACE
This is how they found her~
Suddenly 2001.
She was an alien
DUN DUN DUN
BEWBS!
Sumi's a dude
Nono...
00,10nope but people asumed and thus
suddenly evangelion
riri...
Sumica is a guy I believe
:O
nak nak
ko
BS
Nyra: it'S an r63'd oc
You cant talk in space
Ok.
Nyra: you do know r83, dont you?
Oh, so she's an alien robot with boobs..
?63
What does that mean Dark
**
Nyra: gender swap
Sorry for neb questioin.
Reverse gender character Nyra
Nyra - "Rule 63 - if it exists, there is a version of it of the opposite gender"
00,10it's fine
Ohh, okay.
nyeh
(;¬_¬)
basically it says that for every character created, there is a gender swapped version on ´the internet
00,10I am long acustomed to it
Now I know, and...
I'm back!!!
00,10people assumed with the name
indeed
Heh, i think my first contact with rule63 was in good ol' Baldur's Gate
ohai Canada_Brony
I'd like to see his OC non-R63 in Desktop Pony form, though.
Sumica - so one of these days, you need to change your name to "Sumico" and see if anyone picks up on it
Lol, mine was in WoW.
Whats R63?
now that just yound stupid
Canada_Brony, genderswapping
Sumica: and then you trolled them, and some of the dumv ones took it at face value
Canada_Brony: i jsut explained
oh,ok
My first time seeing R63 was on Futurama
Canada_Brony: rule 63: everything wil be ponified
no
[SWAG]Haku: the episode?
lol, its okay Canada_Brony, I didnt know what it meant either.
sure black holes, why not
RoboGerbil, that's a different rule
that's rule63b?
R34.2 is everything is ponified
thelonepony I dont know the name, but everyone became the opposite gender
rule 63 means that for every existing character, there is a gender swapped version onn the net
oh, 34b
seriously guys, this is basic stuff
this is confuxing
internet 101
^
34b is ponified stuff
http://rulesoftheinternet.com/index.php?title=Main_Page
I know this sounds bizzare, but I would love to genderswap with Chrysalis.
at least not 34
[SWAG]Haku: that episode... horrified me :$
Derpy_Hooves: no. it means that porn will be made
00,10so the long and short of this is. mankind bunkered down in the sol system to hide away from the "space monsteres"
* DerpyMuffins
thelonepony wait, nvm, it was the episode where Bender became a woman for the olympics
dat tab fail
00,10they set up a defence system and abandonded warp drive
so its like guren lagen?
God damn Space Monsters!
00,10the defence system adapted to fight any threats
Space Godzilla
if you people wouldnt insist on stealing half of your name together, it wouldnt ahppem
The was another one, eh, Swag.
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
so many rules, so little time
cuz humans were pushed under ground so the spiral energy wouldnt be detected
Nyra yes, yes it was.
00,10this is the same company that did Gurran laggen
00,10but this came first
And the Topless resembled the Space Monsters the defence system was built to fight against.
that explains alot
Sumica: and NGE
"The Toplessness" ... Odd choice for an evil entity.
With the space rock being. Lol. Love Futurama.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #72
peeps?
Nyra King Ghidora and Gigan were also space monsters
i'd like to point out that rule 34b existed long before ponies and that this version of the rules is faulty
AWESOME Space Monsters!
did you know that R104?
Nyra also Olga
Or Orga
I forget which it was
20% Cooler Monster
Dark_Horst: 34 existed before... 34b is up for debate
But i think it was the one from Gozilla 2000
Love Godzilla 2000
some sort of space monmster thing
[SWAG]Haku: no, there was another episode that the crew and some other people went to a planet, had a race of the sex, the gender change into none, and then he put them in the oppiset genders. and by "him" i mean that Big talking rock that somehow could change peoples gender
lol rule 233
Flaria: i'm very certain there was a 34b the first time i found the rules-list. that was years ago
Yea. It was an island that stood up, flew, then changed into a masive Space Alien Monster.
thelonepony yeah, that existed, but that the Futuramas 2nd R63 episode
eeyup
:3
did you know that R104?
Then Godzilla kicked its ass!
Nyra wasnt that the smog monster?
No, that was from show.
oh
Which one?
Which show?
oh well, there are a hundret different rule lists anyway
so no real way to know which one is right
Who likes the Fausticorn?
the only points they all agree on are 34 and 63
Dark_Horst: Pretty much none, except those two.
Those two make sense.
Nyra so you exicted for the new Godzilla film coming next year?
I've heard there was a rule 404, bt i can't find it...
SirGanjalf: *rimshot.
theres and Error 404
00,10dohoho
RAPE!
yeah, i think i need to sleep
We could have really used a Mica right there

Theres an idea, Kandarihu

I motion the topic be dropped. All in agreement? Good

Good evening everypony.

Hi Canadian_Brony L)
Sumica irk
Sumica, One of the bestes parts
:)*
i bet you cant make a more funny face than this -g3 face- zappp
I thought the pinkie fingers was the best part.
It had one of the great classic SF concepts-- Clone Degradation. Although really accellerated.
Ikr*
when watching this I think of persona 4 anime
And yes Sumi, it was absolutely frightening.
oh !
i know this
Ok, I'm kidding. The fingers bit was actually pretty creepy.
its... umm.
when pinkie turned around with that face i started convulsing in my chair for 15 minutes
i forget
Hi Phase4

11,02I'm happy as can be~
Ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
11,02Let's go walking you and me :D
00,10walking at night, are you crazy
<3
I love this soooooong
get mugged out there
Did I just miss a cold open?
Pfft, I've done that many times before
Oh well. I'm gonna show my mom the Macross 7 movie. I don't have time for the Macross Plus movie before it, though.
So I'll be out of continuity for this too.
00,10ewwww macross 7
Sure it's weird, but it's been a fun series.
00,10could not finish it
00,10hell i could barely start it
I never liked any Macross other than the original series. Just saying.
I'm starting to think Macross Frontier sort of justified the physics of 7.
What's wrong with Macross 7? I've never heard of it.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, 50 episodes of The Power of Rock
^
11,02Dat LadyCanary O3O
Then again, I've never heard of Macross either.
I like how when they talk, all they're mouths do is go up and down
00,10macross is more or less robotech
Kandarihu: Haven't seen that either. :D
Hiya NewSuperBronyU :3
11,02Hai :3/
00,10I love how some one comes in makes one comment then leaves
Sumica: More accurately, Robotech adapts Macross. Then it adapted Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross (and in the words of one pundit, did what the ortiginal couldn't do-- make Southern Cross Interesting) and then Genisis Climber Mospeada.
11,02My grandmother was the first one to introduce me to anime :3
The original Macross series was the first of three completely unrelated mecha series that were crudely fused into a single abomination called Robotech.
Sumica Like me?
NewSuperBronyU: What did she introduce you to? :3
11,02My Neighbor Totoro :3
Ah.
I never saw that.
11,02:<
:$
Kandarihu: Not crudely. In fact, Tastunoko Studios was incredibly happy with the adaptation.
11,02i don't know you anymore...
D:
;~;
/me huggles AJIsAwesome|Busy ^-^
11,02i kid cause ur mah friend \:3/

*meow*
/me pets the SirGanjalf kitteh
BYe, PonyBean. :)
Bye PonyBean :)
11,02Ponies47: O3O I WANNA PLAY DAT
Every canon sequel to Macross dealt with the deep space colonization project that Captain Global started at the end of the first series.
Hey everyone! What's goin on?
NewSuperBronyU, I know :P
Hi TROctavia :)
11,02I would play as Derpy :3c
Rarity is where it's at
Delicious.
mmmm food
11,02Her final smash would be to grow big like Jigglypuff's final smash and then just sit on the entire stage :D
:D
:D
Aw :3
LunaRoyalGuard, XD!
Twi would be lucario with that super beam of magic :0
I'm now two episodes from the end of Frontier and I realize now that Global probably made a huge mistake with that colonization project. I've counted 6 fleets that have either been destroyed or last seen still searching for a planet.
"And with THESE HANDS... I hold the fate of MILLIONS!"
And how many successfully colonized worlds? ONE!
SirGanjalf: Lyra is now Stimpy?
*Ren
Oh, she'd wish.
>URL says Nicolas
I meant Stimpie Pie

00,10You can go ahead and stream on site now NewSuperBronyU
or does IOS and android not support flash?
/me gives the site a goodbye hug
YAY :D
11,02Sumica: Really? What happened? O.O
That way if we can't watch the episode when it airs because we're somewhere that we can't watch it on TV and can't visit the site, we can still watch it using the app!
( 　ﾟ,_ゝﾟ)
NewSuperBronyU: Moooo :3

*waves arm around* BYE oni_link!!
Well looks like Im eventually going to have to clear out some of my play lists
link to picture?
11,02...but the Twitch embed will still be off the site, right?
Eddmario, cool idea and all but the question still remains
how
/me needs ideas for machines to make in creative mode of the xbox version of Minecraft
link to picture?
00,10No I meen i knew you were already streaming to twich
NewSuperBronyU: Can't you go back to Mips or Livestream?
BrawlBRSTMs2 has one strike left, so looks like I will have to clear stuff out in time...
NewSuperBronyU: Or does Twitch work better with WiiU?
00,10feel free to refresh
AW COME ON! NO LINK TO PICTURE?
o.o
why is there a loading screen?
Oh hello pinkies
Does this period of time still allow video links?
O.o
Eddmario, consider the fact that there's multiple stream service and all stream players needs flash
dafuq
it will be complicated
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff - Charity Edition
more complicated than you're thinking
where are the pinkies coming from? :o
＜(。_。)＞ i give up
to much fun
it doesnt help that im sick of this song :/
/me throws Tom back into the Mirror Pool
(〜￣△￣)〜
00,10so how about that lack of volume or pause
http://derpy.me/QKalf YES. :D
#derpy
After watching a playthough of Sonic Before The Sequel, I say its the best representation of a fangame done right
AJIsAwesome|Busy: :D
13you can refresh now
00,10near as we can figure about your twich embed NewSuperBronyU
00,10Firefox is better then other browsers
Back
^
lemme guess sumi the only way to stop it is to popout the embed when thats on to stop it
Says the man who uses chrome right now...
AJIsAwesome|Busy, Aaaaaah Sssssseaponiezzzz
Dawww
will there ever be a stream without Alex S?
00,10or just hit refresh and watch shzu stream SpeccyRush
so true Sumica
This song has practically become Phase4's intro music
13love winamp eq so much
Kandarihu, or any Alex S. song
Yeah
Sumica: already did that, but I mean if shizu wasn't streaming or something
00,10it is nice Shizuka
00,10seeing how old winamp is
So how long did it take you guys to make that pinkie intermission screen? 2 hours?
That's how I know when Phase4 is streaming, even if I'm sleeping
11,02J_E_Smith71: Twitch only works on my Capture software
13SpadeMagnes[R]: it's a swf from dA somewhere
WHY IS THE RUM GONE?
13just a straight iframe
Zacklego: I drank it
00,10true SpeccyRush but shzu's on mips which has volume and pause
Sumica: Eyup. Firefox is best internet browser, followed by Opera/Safari/IE, and Chrome is the worst.
Sumica: exactly :P
dat Steam sound
Oh come on, Chrome is somewhat better than IE
oooh, audiosurf
00,10well all I know is the twich TV embed issue dont seem to happen to those on firefox
Hey, it's better than IE 6
IE for me is faster
13hm should i put you through party with pinkie again with surfing? :3
lol
You cant say IE is good for anything that is better than chrome
IE
Let's all remember Netscape, too
And hi shizu
00,10IE 8 is now better then ever, You can now download othere browses in half the time
XD
SpadeMagnes[R]: It doesn't use all your processing power just to freaking open.
So is IE still good for anything besides getting another browser?
I think there might be an IE 10 coming out...
00,10dat shizu trolling
Sumica: You should do the VIP version of this song, on iron mode, with Ninja Mono. See how long you last.
what game is this?
00,10it's not me any more Eddmario
Does this thing have any video game songs?
Sumica: Woops, meant Shizuka
SpadeMagnes[R], going into Windows Explorer for stuff that you normally can't find going into your C: drive
00,10it's Shizuka playing audio surf
Sumica: Indeed: http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/321/009/541.jpg
SpadeMagnes[R]: You upload your own tracks onto the game.
00,10AttackWithHugs you dont need IE for that
J_E_Smith71, that picture makes me sad
AJIsAwesome|Busy: So I could potentially run Sonic or pokemon songs on this
00,10any file window can do that
aniderp: Audiosurf. It's like every other music game, but still unique and it uses your music library to make the tracks
Wow, Shizuka stream?
SpadeMagnes[R]: Yep.
good morning! :)
How much does Audiosurf run for anyway?
Yep, DerpyMuffins.
Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
Hello DaringDerpy :3
Does anyone have a wii U? If so could you tell me if I should bother seting up online?
TheRandomkid321: SB does. :
*:)
Sumica, I've had to one time. I hate the fact that IE takes like 4 minutes to open and another 3 to show the option to disable add-ons
/me Pushes SB towards TheRandomkid321
Again IE is worst browser

anyone tried any classical in audiosurf?

i use chrome
You there NewSuperBronyU? Randomkid here has some WiiU questions for ya
CrystalPhoenix: Does Video Games Live music count?
CrystalPhoenix: shizu has :)
I use safari... *hides behing sheild*
I would use firefox more if my compuer was decent
Netscape Navigator is best browser :p
Eddmario, I mean Beethoven and mozart
TheRandomkid321: Safari is pretty good actually.
I use mosaic
My computer is a 2012 model :P
Mine is a few years old
I use chrome, but safari isnt bad
Love the 240p stream :P
CrystalPhoenix: Then no, unless you count John Cage's 4'11'
*4'11"
Eddmario: Thats the best song to audiosurf too :P
So is that vortex at the end,...the end?
yep

But I dont want a 3DSXL :P

11,02TheRandomkid321: No universal voice chat system, but there is in certain games. Nintendo Network is free unless you're a minor, which is a $0.50 fee.
Idling on TF2. So leaving PC on. Ping me in the middle of the night and I will kill you :3

Okay, so I was playin' around with Audiosurf the other day, and I tried out Glaze's "She's a Pony" remix. The track was PURE RED!
Theyre forcing the main chatacter off of his island, his home for the past year
What does it being entire red even mean?
http://i.imgur.com/9ERvN.png
SpadeMagnes[R]: it means its creepypasta time

00,10ahhh this song
Super Mario World!
00,10tis what got me hooked on niconico
Needs more mario world
/me divides by zero
DaringDerpy, Applejack is third best pony
SpadeMagnes[R] very, VERY, intense. Warmer the colour, more intense the song. More intensity equals out to flying down the track faster and narrows your FoV
hehe
00,10you know I might have to import this ship to spaceplanes dir
Is Shizuka taking request?
00,10I think it's too large to fit on the launch pad
Sumica: You are getting me excited

Watch out, we got a badass over here!

Do you take request Shizuka?
LurkerBrony Audiosurf. It is fun and addicting.
13did you know eleven minutes of pure silence results in a solid red track
You want torture Shizuka? Play the original Lavender Town!
Shizuka, how?
Try through fire and the flames
00,10hmmm wonder if i should make this thing solar or nucular
wha...
13someone mentioned sims
I want to see the results

Woah
lol simcity 4
dat track
this looks . . . eventful
00,10oh just music
hullo Canadian_Brony
/me is sad now
CrystalPhoenix: lol I already said that
So what color means what on the track?
Sp8ers, so?
SpadeMagnes[R], I think the redder it is the more points you get
/me pats Sumica on the back
but the track gets radical on red
So the redder it gets the harder it is?
For Mono, The color indicates intensity of the current song
downhill is mostly red/yellow
This song doesnt look too hard right now...
I suspect it gets worse
CrystalPhoenix eeyup. More intense = more points. SpadeMagnes[R] more like, warmer the colour. Default colours are purple as least and red as most.
Play Through The Fire and The Flames by Dragonforce.
pfft
VenHur: YES
Evening everyone. :)
that song sucks though
easy peasy
God I hate being sick, I think I just coughed up some phlem
Rain: go kill urself pls
Awfully long song = Hardest diffculty?
cachi01|Blackcops2, you should take your own advice.
no thanks, I have good taste in music, cachi01|Blackcops2

Canadian_Brony: OK
Oh, shit gonna get whack, yo.

O_____O

twilight_sprinkle: agreed
We need to go bach to the past
a red and black audiosurf track?
it must be one of the originals
Hakus back, and hopefully this time to stay
SpadeMagnes[R]: what u did thur i c
FUUUUUU
hi [SWAG]Haku :)
Whats with the trippy race track?
hey chachi01
Shizuka: need more of a challange
Aaaaaaaaaaand nobodygivesashitthatI'monline. :(
for some reason, I picture Castelvania
?
Die monster you dont belong in this world
any army of pie members on?
castlevania reference FTW
Yay! ^_^
/me looks around and steals Jmo
AppleDash:
I'm doing alright
So why is this track all black and rainbowy?
AppleDash: :O
O:
in audiosurd, expert mode is usually black
surf****
SpadeMagnes[R]: black and rainbowy sounds contradictory
So I have decided that I now hate my neighbors, and those who have known me for a well enough know I dislike using the word hate, since its such a strong word
VEEEERY random question, but does anybody here watch the anime Smile Precure?
And specifically, did anybody see the most recent episode?
Nope.
Sp8ers really? I just customize it to have a black background no matter what. You can also change which colours come up at different intensity levels, but I usually keep those at default.
And nope.
So the streamer is still playing this game?
So how do you get from one side to the other really fast?
to long
SpadeMagnes[R]: movin your mouse
well yes, but assuming you leave the backgorund to "auto" it will change based on dofficulty
SO MUCH PURPLE
difficulty***
sorry, im eating and typing is hard
SpadeMagnes[R] currently, she's using a mouse, but if you have a keyboard, *S* will get you to the left lane and *D* will put you in the right, no matter which lane you're in. When you let go, you return to the middle lane.
You can't use the arrow keys to move from side to side?
Shizuka: are we there yet :3
You can fluffeh
AssaultWithEmbraces you can. I wouldn't play if you couldn't.
Wooo
YES
I AM VERY AMMUSED NOW
Good for you.
Hey, Jmo. I stolededed youu
I noticed :>
and I threw a muffin at you!
Jmo: :|
/me throws a muffin at AssaultWithEmbraces
So specific :P
Argh are you ever going to run out of muffins?!
XD
lol
SpadeMagnes[R] hell nah
im bored again
NO! I work at the muffin factory
U SEE THIS BUTTON
nope
I WILL PRESS IT
ಠ_ಠ
I forget, MLP:FiM also has a largely male periphery demographic.
/me puts a Pinkie on Jmo's head and watches her sleep
AND IF IT WORK IT WILL MAKE MORE BUTTONS ON GAME
Prince_Lightstar the most important rules of BronyState: NEVER complain about the stream, and NEVER request ponies.
/me presses button
ermagerd Pinkay
So my nieghbors just threw a bag of trash into my front yard, one filled with party debris, coke cans, and dirty diapers. Guess who has to clean it up...
BACH BACH BACH
Canadian_Brony: wat i am not complainin bout the stream
Ooooo Bach
GACH GACH GACH
Canadian_Brony: im ammused :P
And now my dog is tearing it up all over the place...
[SWAG]Haku: damn

[SWAG]Haku: go speak with them

GERK GERK GERK
[SWAG]Haku: Throw it back into their yard
[SWAG]Haku, have you told your neighbors about that?
GK GK GK
leh French
GAK GAK GAK
I have told our neighbors several times of this type of crap
Time to report them, then
Most of the time I try to be nice but when people pull shit, I drop the nice guy act
My mother has even called the police on them because they get out fo hand all the time
[SWAG]Haku: tiem to call le real life mods
Nothing gets them to stopo
Shoot, we're back to being kicked for G-word talk, huh?
[SWAG]Haku: I say throw the shit back into their own yard
No, no
Well a ticket for littering should set them straight, since they're throwing their trash on your property
I must be a better person than them
I remember saying the G-word a few days ago and being perfectly fine.
Shizuka: plz play good ol days by livingtombstone
13no don't have it don't want it
00,10you know even I think this rocket is a bad idea
Well there are times when you have to cut the crap and do things the hard way
Do Tori no Shi now.
Oh trust me, We've given a fair share of tickets
Good Ol' Days is choppy
Well...next stop would be jail since you can go to jail for it
Canadian_Brony: well ur cnadian
I saw you had Tori no Shi. Do Tori no Shi.
Sumica: I doubt its that bad
Yaaaaaaaaaay!!
GTG to sleep...
Night VenHur
Goodnight VenHur
[SWAG]Haku: have you asked them why they throw trash onto your yard?

Oh

Canadian_Brony: ill hug anyone in here but u

I'd rather have a muffin baked by derpy
Canadian_Brony: well i have muffin baked by derpy

Ok, so the mess wasnt as hard to clean up as I thought it would be
cachi01|Blackcops2: i thouught she kill them by the bunches
[SWAG]Haku: Still shouldent let that shit slide
Shizuka: continue the japanese
Well its almost midnight here
[SWAG]Haku, have any of your other neighbors reported them?
/me bops along to the music
It's 15 to 10 where I am.
Im going to be the bigger person and tell them in the morning
[SWAG]Haku, show no mercy
That is, fifteen minutes to 10 PM.

SuperBrony64: Wow...

13little debbie is releasing Cloud Cakes
13which is twinkies
I'm going to sell twinkies for major profit

O U SuperBrony64
man, i could go for an Almond Joy right now
13it's funny how gta4 is not supposed to be canon with gta3-SA but has every reference to it
/me gives SuperBrony64 a muffin for making a funny
nope Sumica
/me noms on the muffin
twinkie boy will be in disapoint
13gta4 is supposed to kick off new canon
i think he knows where he is
13nice of roman to fix the taxi without leaving his desk
he just doesn't care much for your concern
13ey lil jacob mon
what in the hell did that sentence even mean>
13i mean you slowly pick up the patterns, like he never says "me" it's always "I and I"
Sniping would probably be off by miles, Sumi
13i can feel the frames dropping from here
13wonder if sumi can see his framerate or not
he can probably feel it Shizuka
DAT LAG
Hi everybody :)
13looks like rendering lag, but then i'm usually on this side of stream latency so i wouldn't really know if this is normal for gta4 streams
Yeah, jacob make-a no sunse
13could try ffsplit+dxtory like i do
your streams gta4 are stutter free shizu
*of
o.o
So much pink
i wanna see the flying cars again xD
SpeccyRush: are you SpectrumRush?
the more pink the better :)
13Sumica: what i mean is is the stuttering i see your end catching up with the game or just stream being stream?
Pinkies4thWall: yes
Ah. got it
and its Spectrum_Rush :P
13okay so stream then :3
13from here it looks like the engine falls behind and throws in a bunch of smooth frames to catch up, but that's probably actually the stream doing it :)
I would change my DA, but that's a premium feature, and i don't has premium. :[
Stupid monetary stuff
13game doesn't fill view
13there we go
Alright, guys. I think it's time for me to go to bed.
Goodnight!

I do not have a horn, so I don't think that would work. :D

im a potato
whats the name of this song
I know the melody but not what it's called...
Greensleeves apparently
one time i got money walked outside for icecream dude going down to get an icecream and guess what happened
Well I looked up a FAQ for GTA4 and it listed the controls as giving one the ability to manually scroll through tracks on Independance FM. So I guess it IS for custom tracks
you are one good driver
MadSurge: No, we moved on from greensleeves
kill someone
lol its funny that we all heard it but dont know what its called
Ah
And now Flight of the Bumblebee.
^
Ew what the hell?

In a city with a population of at least 100k, there are absolutely no kids. Fact.
the icecream man was like drive by
so i never got icecream :<

Sex is once every thousand years, by one family.
In that one city
it reminded me somehow of the exorcist theme...

I hate mornings, but the man needs his full breakfast and lunch.
05morning folks
hi
Mornin' Wrek
ohai Wrek! =D
heya Wrek!
Yo Wrek!
:D
Morning Wrek.
woops
:)
hey Wrek
There we go
Gold_Demona: I bet you're great at making food :3
Hey guys
Wrek: bedtime
about that anime that Sumica streamed
http://fav.me/d5lnv3c
shot those green car guys
MadSurge: I like to think I'm pretty good in the kitchen. :>
05i hope the stream gaps are much shorter now yes? :P
MadSurge: At any rate, I almost never get a complaint from the husband.
im better at baking than cooking
MadSurge: I've only made bad food once, and that was years ago.
Neither of us could eat it. XP
CrystalPhoenix: I'd prefer ponified Excel and Hyatt :|
Gold_Demona: theres such thing as bad food?
Bronysith: Food that tastes so bad it's not worth keeping.
yes like cheese ravioli
like work had it once.. was aweful
Gold_Demona: noone is good everything.
I like cheese ravioli. :<
it was filled with cheese
*at
^
I dun like humanize ponies
05guys?
05or?
no meat
unless they actually look like humans
I know
aniderp, ehh, I wouldn't mind that .-.
I like both kinds of ravioli
i thought it was the chef boyardee
it wasnt :<
Ew I HATE chef boyardi
I don't know Wrek, I was getting into the Buffer show while you were unable to stream here :P
Chef Boyardi is NASTY
anthro ponies arnt that bad
05pfft
Also, finally got my free copy of Halo 4 in the mail <3
Fort Boyard was a good show
DashWithRainbows: ENJOY MATE
No sleep for a week for me.
Buffershow is best show! \:3/
anthro ponies are good if done right
/me gives DashWithRainbows energy shots
CrystalPhoenix Like Atryl does them?
the quaker oats guy i creepy
is
DashWithRainbows Red vs Blue?
DashWithRainbows, why yes I do enjoy atryl
Good lad :3
05i dislike "human" ponies. i dislike very anthropomorphed aswell. but i have nothign agaisnt ponies like, standing on their backlegs etc
Any World of tankers in here?
lyra
Gold_Demona: I thought Chef Boyardee was a nickname for a guy who made a silly RPG with Clive Barkley as the protagonist :D
Wrek: so you like more feral ponies?
Atryl is the only Anthro artist I can really look up to.
Gold_Demona: so it's a real thing?
05atryl is the exception for me
MadSurge: It's a brand of canned pasta
its food
05casue those anthro's i digg
Lunac I like that series quite a bit, I need to catch up on the episodes though.
05also no not feral ones. show ones.
You'll like the new ones :)
Poor Florida..
Gold_Demona: no. Get some uncooked pasta and boil it. Even I can do that!
No GTA4? :(
Hmmm, I'm trying to remember where I got up to, Lunac.
05like this:
00,10atryl?
05she's standing on her back legs and all
05but isnt anthrofied too much
thats a nice Massect wallpaper
Thanks for streaming, then
If anyone can make me uncooked pasta for dinner lunch and supper
*effect
I will love you
Wrek: well done
Wrek, <3 that hat
DashWithRaoinbows Watch from the start anyway :P
05Sumica: ill link you some work later from atryl
MadSurge: Exactly! The sauce in the Chef Boyardee cans is disgusting. I don't understand how anyone can eat that.
Who will stream next?
i like them..
Wrek, nice
When I make pasta, I boil the stuff myself and season the sauce myself.
00,10streams clear wrek, have fun
brb, empying bowels
plus the sauce it was in at work.. was horrible tatsing sauce
05Gold_Demona: making me hungry for pasta again :|
lol
Is that a good thing or a bad thing, Wrek? :D
was like water sauce
05bit of both
no flavor
Gold_Demona: before the tomato pasta was eaten with cheese and gravy :3
What will you stream Wrek?
Whenever i cook pasta, i always make my own sauce, Get some italian sausage, cook that up to almost taco like meat, add rosemary, secret seasonings, add garlic, LOTS OF GARLIC let it simmer for a few hours, and my god that sauce is awesome
I love spaghetti with a meaty tomato sauce seasoned with lots of garlic and oregano. :>
Wrek, 6 hours \:3/
it had no meat sauce it was nassssty
no spices.. ick
Anthro is wrong for all but trains Awdry style
i think mud would taste better than that food that day
i like the shows ponies better
What about gargoyles, Wrek? http://fav.me/d3k0ebe
Anthro is okay on occasion for me >.>
Ew, garlic :s I can eat that only on pasta with broccoli and anchovy sauce
any pony anthro with a bra on only is yuck
MadSurge: disgusting
00,10I rather like wreks anthro style
Shame they didn't just use human characters instead of ponies being a fan wouldn't be such a stigma
Bronysith: less than you'd think
Gold_Demona: Gargoyles you say?... http://derpiboo.ru/45876
Ah yes, Bri-chan :3
Request Spoony Hitman Bloodmoney playthrough: http://www.twitch.tv/spoonyone/b/290016349

00,10well the budget model if the wiiU is't cheep compared
Alchemist: I still prefer traditional art over modern installations :D
Consoles go expensive as hell when they're imported to my country ;_;
the Wii U has one of the lowest release prices in modern console history
I'm planning to ask my brother if he can buy a Wii U
He's abroad

Can't you hang around a populated area

we rarely have to deal with bullies here
dosent matter to him he still beat me the more people the better
Have you try to fight back before? Or sticking to a place with lots of People/Teachers afk Breakfast is here brb
^
i fight all the tim but this guy is to strong
*time*
Wait, youre 10 and you fight all the time??
year 13,..so thats make him like in the mid of 8th grade isnt it
Don't bother RaveBrony
RaveBrony, year 10, not 10
im 16teen i ment to be year 12 but i got held back
JEEZ I WONDER WHY.
wait....
oohhhhh
iget it
Oooh, i didnt understand the whole "yeah #" thing
wait
so who wants to talk about star craft spoilers?
jmo are you call me stupid
Meh, i went to catholic school.... so i never really had issues with bullies :\
I'll let you figure that out for yourself kiddo.
Lol
ahhh
RaveBrony: this guy is a beast his dad beat my dad up in school
Dafuq!?
Now, that, is just plain odd
RaveBrony: so im probly gona get knocked out again

he egg broke his hand in the last fight he was dumb enoght to start
Wha?
yeah he hits hard
back, Just remeber to never give up, If you cant win with power win with wits duck and weave the best you can and aim for the face, people who bully need a good hit to the face
Bronystate continues to shine brightly with its ever knowing knowledge.
I don't like to fight ether but i will if need be.
Haha
I dont know how to fight, therefore I avoid it
I always made friends with strong people :3
RaveBrony: yeah i should adovid it but i have serios problems with my anger

DAMN BUGS
RaveBrony: but fighting is in human nature its what where built to do

http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353419095017.png :D

^same
well then good afternoon you two
Let me guess, Wrek and StarScraft?
Yupper
Guess what I saw on Steam just now...
A game.
words and images?
90% off on AC3?
It's a non-image link and it's VERY relavent to Wrek's interests.
You mean his adult stuff?
DerpyMuffins, nnnope
ill take the link
Kandarihu Cool send it
killerpony7733, I need permission from Wrek to post it.
You might want to ask Wrek first
It's non-image
dont think hes paying attition to chat
He does
He played the beta of it like crazy before he was b&
Oh planetside 2?
It got a release?
Today
In just about 3 hours
actually u guys
Eeyup.
Knew it
weve been talking about ps2 for awhile
Well I guess there's no point in posting the link now.
It's kinda old news
It's both on steam and on the PS2 main site to download on
can u dl it yet?
Nope probably just about when it counts to 0
sigh
naturesfury, not from Steam yet
I'm most likely getting it to use on steam
well ima go to next town over and get some breakfest. see yall in 50 mins
And besides, my computer will never be able to run it. The GPU is below minimum.
You can get ps2 in about 3 hours
Give or take
I can run it just about decently
hi guys
what are we watching?
SC2
Wrek playing Starcraft 2.
:)
Yeah. From my experience with Steam, the availability of a F2P game takes a few hours after the PLAY NOW button appears on the store page.
Maybe maybe not
I hear SC!
SC 1 or 2?

Why do all of the protoss wear little things over their mouths?
They have no mouths .-.
Lower faces

Wrek, learn Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2 :P
Energy juice

They absorb universe juices into themselves.
*they're
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw5683-Scotaloo_Regrets_Nothing.gif
its the day that all of the trans people that have been murdered in transphobic attacks are honored and remembered, Deacon
I have no mouth and I must scream
I have no mouth and I must "My life for Aiur!"
Rain ah, taken note of
their whole race is built upon psi engery
they probabyl eat the stuff too
SO telepathic derp-talk
?
yes
Stalkers like it cold. Apparently.
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw2258_medium.png
265 people were murdered this year just because some people couldnt stand seeing them be themselves.
wat?
chat ded?
Dead stuff :P
seems so
yup. and those are just the reported ones.
it's hangin in there
Rain: maybe it would help if you'd tell us what the fuck you're talking about
context is a nice thing

It probably got lost in the MLFW spam.
oh. it's you again

rain: I have no idea what the fuck that is.
That is all.
Meanwhile: http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw6255-images.jpg
Prince_Lightstar: That image is probably true every day of your life.
its the anual day where all of the people killed in transphobic attacks are honored and remembered

Ok one moment
who is streaming
the fear of transgendered people
Wrek's streaming.
advice: dont discuss anyhting wiht that guy. he will do his darndest to describe you as a transgender hating blodhungry beast
how can u tell
we already had that
that girl*
that girl
Wait, so people who get murdered cause they're transgender all get remembered on one day, but people in general don't get a day like that?

I'm not hating on transgender at all either.
I know :D
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw7939-tumblr_ma5mijxhy51rcjmu8o1_500.gif
you're asking what makes us so different from normal people. thats what I like
we arent different, but people like to treat us like we are :3
/me 08,01sneaks up on Uncouth and stealthily hugs
That went to hell XD
There is nothing different. You're the same as every person, just with a different persspective.
perspective*
And if people think you're different cause you don't fit their perspective, fuck them.
Banelings, because it wasn't bad enough when they just ate your face, now they have to explode in a shower of acidic guts.
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/rsz/mlfw5366_medium.jpg
I really like you Jmo
08,01Jmo: people can observe whatever they want
oh, I have been huged!
me too
They can, but if they're going to observe negative they should keep it to themselves.
hugged*
now the reason we do this TDoR day, Jmo, is because of the way it happens..
right, hugged :)
Fuck the society of today, so wrong.
if you want to be seen as equals, you should not ask for special days
08,01so show some goddamn respect for those who want to observe transgender rememberance day
just saying
08,01it's their fucking prerogativee
Dark_Horst, so like veterans day?
08,01if you don't want to celebrate it, that's yours
Of course Venus.
08,01but don't be such a drama llama about it
Ded
http://dashie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw1741-1319403477.jpg
08,01</rant>
Zeratul, why would you run in there like a lemon? You're a rogue, not a paladin.
ima evel nointey paradin
also its more to raise awareness that it happens
a lot
08,01Meanwhile: battlerogue of death
08,01DPS rogue
i rember the last time you treid to raise awareness. we were aware after the first 5 minutes but you kept on for half an hour. throwing around groundless accusations
Combat rogue was not built to tank. (No matter how many times I was expected to tank tentacles in Heroic Dragon Soul)
Ahahahaha DS
Ikr?
groundless? http://lexiecannes.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/trans-woman-sues-u-s-govt-over-tasering-by-park-ranger/
08,01Meanwhile: i can out-DPS a fair few equal level palies with my rogue
08,01do i mean palies... no, i think i mean mages
A pure dps class can outperform a hybrid. Who'da thought it.
yes, groundless. as in accusing people in here for being intolerant fucks for no reason
08,01honestly, it's been ages since i've played WoW
Lies, no one can outdps mages. Not since they were reduced to 3 button arcane rotations.
if an accusation is made towards someone without any reason, that is a groundless accusation
08,01Dark_Horst: maybe it's because some people in here are intolerant fucks...
I've tried several times to return to WoW, tis just too boring.
it's also very insulting
Venus: true. but i didnt see any of those the last time
08,01oh! speaking of intolerant fucks, it's time for another episode of Shit My Mother Says
Pfft.
no no, I didnt acuse you of being intolerant fucks. I said if a bully is beating someone and you dont even tell someone about it or try to stop it, you are as bad as the bully
08,01"i have nothing against gays, so long as they stay away from me and my family"
question: would intolerant fucks stop to be intolerant fucks by "raising awareness"?
probably not
does anyone know of the top of their hat, if Celesta said in S3 E1 if they defeated King Sombra "1000 Years ago" or "over 1000 years ago" or "thousands of years ago" ?
08,01Alchemist: depends on their motive. i they're raising awareness so that they can get together a lynch mob...
didnt call you intolerant fucks and yes actually.
08,01*if
Rain: I know you didnt, Im just running along with the term someone else mentioned to make my point. Sorry.
and that'S what i mean. i complain about being groundlessly accused, which did happen, and then i get a report thrown at me that is supposed to justify said accusation towards me?
sorry, but no
I didnt accuse you.
logic does not work that way
you did
This is getting silly.
not today
ok then
08,01oh, another gem: "i think gays should just stick to their own community"; also: "what use are gays to society? they can't reproduce."
Im not accusing you now
how about that?
What with the whole running in circles for the past 5 minutes.
08,01she also thinks "it" is the appropriate transgender pronoun...
doesnt help that you did. so yeah, my attitude towars you just might be a bit negatively influenced because of that
/me shrugs
what ever. I tried
if it helps, I appologise for the statement I cant remember
08,01i don't know whether to laugh, cry, break shit, or all of the above
about the things your mom says, Venus?
08,01yes
you should contest her, because all of what she is saying is crap
it also seems she's repeating the most commonly used phrases
Venus or "I'm, fine with Gays unless they reproduce"
08,01it's really actually starting to get to me
08,01it never really did before
Venus: Im sorry to say this, but it doesnt seem you can do much about it.
is this Starcraft 2?
it is
Im trying to find the link that lists off 20 of the people that died and how
one of them had her throat slit and her face sliced up with a knife.
... I never played iut, but it kinda looks like Warcraft 3 with better grafics
Thats the kind of thing this day is trying to bring awareness too
08,01Rain: as a reasonable, logical, and cogent member of the human race, it's hard to argue with someone who i'm pretty sure actually has no brain
08,01just a simple nervous system that knows how to make curry
08,01take that, darwin.
lol
hope the curry is good at least
The cheese?
anyway, all that woman did to get her face slashed and her throat cut, was exist. which is fucked up
Oh the chieves.
08,01only when she makes it with ingredients that aren't 3 years out of date
08,01and that's just the meat
Rain: sad thing is, you dont even have to be transgender/gay whatever else for this to happen to you. Just be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
yes, but imagine using a public restroom
08,01Alchemist: but being transgender/gay helps
and getting your ass kicked for it
Venus: it can...
just being afraid to go to the bathroom, or walk down the street
08,01but also, a big killer of transpeople is suicide
yeah
I have been jumped for no reason and Im as bland and average as it gets.
08,01there's a reason why it's called gender dysphoria.
the attempt rate is 41% of the trans population
the general population of everybody? 6%
08,01i mean, being trans is a dificult lifestyle choice
08,01just like AIDS.
Venus: lifestyle CHOICE :D
poor choice wrek
Tosh > Nova.
Alchemist, he said choice and then said AIDS
which means its not a choice
Rain: I know, thats why Im laughing
08,01Alchemist: that was a reductio ad absurdum comment
Wasn't reductio a spell in Harry Potter?
Venus: i know
08,01ah, okay
Venus can you call the London Philarmonic and tell them that their version of One-Winged-Angel in " The Greatest Video Game Music 2" sounded rather unspecial and that this song has been done countless times anyway?
08,01Lil_B: next time i'm on the phone to their booking manager, i'll mention it
thanks :P
hay Lil_B ^^
oh, found that link
hey Invi :3
wrek
Venus, may I post this link?
r u downloading planet side 2 on steam
08,01Rain: pm it me first
Wrek why don't you mindblast or whatever it's called?
i think he only has 89ish energy
watching stream instead of studying is sooo satisfying right now.
but it wont be for much longer...

You're gonna get robbed.
I dont know why but the fact I went a week and a half not playing WoW I was not rusty at all getting back into it...not sure how to feel about that
meanwhile i got noing so they cant rob me
Meanwhile: I was when I moved to a new apartment and was alone for a week.
Alchemist: Bummer.
something: I didnt have much either, they stil managed to steal my shoes :D
I remember seeing a tag on a piece of luggage that said "Nothing worth stealing here"
I wonder how much that helps
Maybe put another tag inside that reads "Told ya!"
Morning bronystate
Hi Moopy !
this game sucks by
morning Moopy
eeyup
Hai Moopy :3
allo moobull69
Watching a game and playing a game can be different experiences
er... Moopy
Heheh
It can be fun playing a game, but watching said game can be boring as fuck
SpadeMagnes[School] then does that mean letsplays are equally as boring?
so when i just got on why is the pony server being so slow today?
I said it can be boring and besides, some letsplays make it interesting to watch
hello
Whoops
Hai moobull69 :D
Multi kill!
it is quiet this afternoon
I dont know why but this kind of gameplay doesnt really seem to interest me that much
is now, was a tad more active a little while ago
booring
which game is it?
confound these walk cycles >.<
i want some POWNY
<.<
powny Rule 1 of Brownystate, don't ask for POWNYS
Besides I like ponies but streaming nothing but that might get tiresome after a while
:(
wasn't that also th3e second rule as well?
Dare I say this, you can only have so much pony
powny: Read the FAQs, it explains it there :3
ok what game is it?
Deacon nope, 2nd rule is Bacon
so, Dark_Horst. I appologise for being really angry last time I was talking about this topic. its a sensitive one for me and someone compaired it to liking an unpopular music genre so I got pretty iritated..
hmm... bacon isn't number 1?
I call blasphemy Lil_B
Wrek: dont u mean jamacian empire?
yay lets argue about the rules
Rule 3, rule 4 is false
:D
good evening bronystate :)
rule 4, rule 3 is false. which one is false now?
Invi be happy it's befoore the Cake rule!
Hello DaringDerpy :)
yo DaringDerpy
Rain: i can accept that. still, that someone wasnt me
I know it wasnt

Hola
hi IshSadPony
lali-ho Ish!
do u remember the S & ep no?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Savages / Character Flaw / Crystal Slaves / Eternal Fun / Twilight Caring
Hey IshSadPony!
/me is sad :(
hi IshSadPony
how come ish? :(
Deacon I was playing OOT3D, and my next task is....is......the water temple *bursts into tearS*
OOH S2E11
oh god, I know how you feel :(
oh please
Everyone makes the water temple harder than it really is sometimes <.<
the water temple is easy
even more so in the 3ds version
/me kids today
More so in the Master Quest version
^this, it took me some time but I didn't consider the water temple to be uber hard
Some how the game that is supposed to make the dungeons harder, made the water temple easier
HOW DOES THAT WORK
thanks to the Nintendo Magazine, I got through the Water Temple, but as a KLid I could not get to the Forrest Temple, it was so goddamn scary
btw, does anyone know of Celestia at the beginning of the Primere. They defeated King Sombra "1000 years ","over 1000 years" or "thousands of years" ago? I forgot
if*
I think it was 1000 years ago.
Then how the hell was luna around then?
^
SpadeMagnes[School] that why I'm asking
This is what one calls 'overthinking' :P
If you want to push it:
maybe nightmare moon worked with sombra and discord
Also why are all these evil gods from 1000 years ago, why 1000? that seems so arbitrary
and sombra is just a bit late
There you go, fanfic-ish explanation.
SpadeMagnes[School] why do spells last until midnight? it's just a trope
unless I'm mistaken with what she said, we got a rather clear logical flaw here
Oh no.
A logical flaw in a cartoon for children? :P
Lasharus better stop the presses
^
Lasharus: Its kind of a large plot hole
Lasharus shaddup, I like finding flaws :P
Lil_B, what if Sombras curse was delayed for some time
Cue laughter.
All right, here's another explanation.
Luna was banished 1000 years ago so how the fuck did she help defeat sombra
If it was EXACTLY 1000 years to the day on the season premiere?
52 min till launch
Not even marauders match my accent!
maybe it was 999 years ago?
Then Luna was banished a little later.
Just say "okay, a thousand years, give or take a decade"
There you go, plot hole insulant applied.
Plot hole!
Lasharus: yeah, that's what I thoughy
*t
Does take away from the significance of the 1000 years PRECISELY, but whatever.
Lasharus well, they describet rather clearly that the banishing of Nightmarew Moon was 1000 years ago by the day Twilight came to Ponyville
Also, thank you moobull69. SOMEONE had to...
Astonishing, Lil_B. Then the Crystal Empire was 1010 years.
Why is 1000 years such a arbitray number for unholy evil?
or 1001
I mean, really, it's a plothole that is designed to be filled up by approximately 5000 fanfic-writers. Done.
Lasharus Yeah I takle that, still I like the error :P
If indeed it's an error.
I'd call it 'overthinking it. Massively.'
how twlilght sparkle discoved ponyville
Lasharus: Well its kind of a massive plot hole
But then, I'm a cynic.
Hi, Good morning everyone
No it's not.
SpadeMagnes[School] actually it's 917, but 1000 sounds more fitting
They never explicitly stated the Crystal Empire was PRECISELY 1000 years.
SpadeMagnes[School] because they can't say "666 years ago" in a kids show :P
if lauren faust was still doing *almost* everything this plot hole may not have happened :P
Lasharus say said the banishing weas 1000 years ago
morning TGaPT
So done. Plot hole insulated.
What, of Luna or the Empire?
Im calling it now the next villian was some evill banished for 1000 years since they seem so obsessed with that number
Lasharus actuallly, both
Neat.
I stand by the fact that, yes, it may be a plothole, but is it a big deal? Sorry, but no.
dafuw
dafuq
so, 48 minutes til planetside
gah
Im gonna give my theory
hello hi AHOY!
Lasharus I never sdaid it's a big Plothole, I care about it that much -><-
lali-ho Rocket
Sombra got banished than later luna's banishment happened
I know Lil_B, but I'm also responding to SpadeMagnes[School], who DID say that. :P
Discord...somewhere inbetween maybe
oh my gawd it's star craft!!!!~~~!
I thought he was just 'from a distant past'.
nope, jsut banished
is dat sum star craft? :P
He said he was turned to stone I think 1000 years ago... I think
yea
Lasharus no, Discord was dated as prior to Nightmare Moon
Going by all of this, I think '1000 years' is not THAT overused.
I still question the logic of keeping a god of chaos in your garden where it could freely escape
xD
We've had four 'major villains'. Yes, 50% could be argued, but really, on a focus group of four, that doesn't really make much of a point. :P
I'm gonna bet whenever a writer goes on a panel, some fan is gonna ask about sombra and luna 1000 years thing
it cant rly
turned to stone
Lasharus I just remember the argumenting after the Crhistmas Carol Episode, where they discussed "how can Ponyville have been founded like this, if Discord rules the Land before Luna and Celestia came?"
Yea...Discord,Luna and Celestia are mentioned no where in that story at all
I think I missed that ep
/me peeks into chat.
ohai LadyCanary
People just overanalyse. I tend to just enjoy the series for what it is, and let the issues on that level... eh, I just ignore ´em.
Hiya.
It happens, yes, but meh.
44 :D
Wait a second.
yo canary
THIS IS A WREKY STREAM ISNT IT
Evening everbrony.
mmhmm
Inb4 Planetside 2 servers break because of surge in numbers.
lali-ho Malavolent
:D My love!!!!!!!!!
I still say the issue saying Luna was banished 1000 years ago and sayign she helped banish Sombra 1000 years ago with out specifying what happened when seems like a plot hole but eh
lool
robo fetish xD
lol
O U
wrek
Yeah, but asking for specifics in this thing is really, it seems, our thing. The cartoon itself couldn't really care less, I rather suspect. :P
I got the best theory to explain it all: it's a kid's show
is this game any good
/me nuzzles Wreky :3
I heard the orig planetside was kinda disappointing
SpadeMagnes[School] oh its just an show, just watch it xD
That's what I just said, Deacon. Just with more words. :P
wipergone2 it's been used with many LAN parties, I guess so
I know its just a show but it still seem slike a massive contradiction to the whole story
ORBITAL COMMAND, you daft bugger!
Yes, but we've got about three tidbits of 'overarching story', to be fair.
90% of it is standalone.
So, im late to join. what are we doing?
SpadeMagnes[School] don't worry, We'll place a rug above the that Plothole and everythiung will look fine
Well when i just came back from the living room i saw the chat stoped going
lali-ho PaRappaTheRapper
Wrek playing the first Planetside I think.
Wait... Deacon= Dken?!
Deacon: What?
PaRappaTheRapper dwarven greeting
Thats his way of saying hello
LadyCanary and yes ;)
Deacon: oh.
:O Oh!
she'S pretty
actually planetside got an 81 on metacritic, thats not toooo bad
Do I even want to guess what IGN gave it?
robo and alien fetish***
He's dead Jim.
ign gave it 77 :/
>caring about IGN reviews.
I stopped listening to IGN's bullshit a long time ago.
You cant spell Ignorant with out IGN
well maxim gave it a 100
Someone listens to IGN these days? :P
I've never read a review in my life
ever
with the exception of a magazine article about half life 1
Listen to Zero Punctuation.
If it isnt Call of Duty it sucks, is their viewpoint
not even he's right
vivix, how do u make informed purchases then???
Take that with a pinch of salt, and you've got a fairly accurate view. :P
IGN ... I never visit that site unless I wanna read about Secreats or Walkthroughts
I buy what looks nice
IGN review things? I thought they sold ratings.
Oh discussion about money eating reviewers.
Woo.
Exactly SpadeMagnes[School]
Reviews aren't interesting when it comes to books, music, games or art
If you wanna play the game, then play it.
Not exactly, Vivix.
You've got mail!
Reviews shouldnt dictate how you play.
That's my opinion, anyway
They are interesting when it comes to REALLY BAD games, etc.
i have starcraft, but i m such a big BIG big noob :C
Shit, they gave Alice Madness Returns a shit review and did I care? No! Did I dislike the game? Hell yes.
Reviewers aren't paid very well anyway, so if they have to go through something atrocious, they tend to tear it to pieces. Which is often amusing to read. :P
Loading why are we still loading
loading an loading files
My view point is this, I dont judge a game from what people say, I play it my self first
There's only one game I regret not reading a review about, and that is stronghold 3
/me giggles.
because it didn't even work for like 50% of the players
Unless the game is Sonic 06 or Super Man 64
Then you can judge it regardless
SHHHHH
Apparently they fixed that one a fair bit Vivix.
We dont talk about that :|
Sonic 2006?
Oh yes I do.
They might have, it still doesn't start to me, but I got a free gold-version , so maybe htat one works
I'm a Robotnik/Eggman fan. I can't avoid hating on that piece of *bleep*
Captian Mcgolden nipples
FANBOYYYYY
Most definitely, LadyCanary. I wear the emblem with pride.
Vivix I know that feel... Pr-Ordered it...
Alongside the logo of the Eggman Empire, of course.
...Well then Lasharus. *cocks shotgun* TO THE BACK WITH YOU
"The Eggman Empire - Get a load of this!"
Guys i joined late. What is going on?
nuhthing
Lil_B, ouuch
Erm, LadyCanary? If we're going into random RP territory I'm busting out the Egg Dragoon II :P
Pingas
Vivix Stronghold 3 was so bad when it came out, and now after I played the Gold Version... It didn't improved much, it's broken in the very core
And I may have to slap you, SpadeMagnes[School].
Just another boring tuesday
still? aww.
It didn't even get past the splash screen to me, never got to boot it up
is there any lottery survey up yet? Said it's up Monday-Thursday, but nothing yet
Nah, Im joking aaround Lasharus
And pony_8089, patience.
As am I, but I"m a git. :P
Vivix it worked alöways for me, but the Gameplay, Bugs, and everything is just horrible
(Must be said though, the Egg Dragoon II looks brilliant, if you've ever played Sonic Generations)
aah
I guess it's not up then - I was simply curious if it wasn't showing for me :-)
Yeah I read about it while trying to fix it, missing actions <,< buugs--oh my
Damnit, LadyCanary, it's no fun fanboying if you won't respond.
Heh.
Oh Egg Emperor, you so pathetic
That's Sonic Heroes.
Oh god.
And technically, that wasn't Robotnik.
:P
Well, my freind just msged me on skype. Probably going soon to play minecraft with him. Maybe.'
I actually enjoyed playing 2 player VS Sonic Heroes.
Vivix the Menue feels like it's made in Flash, the Mechanics are worthless, the Building is stupid, I sspent 49€ on Stronghold 1... because Preorder Bonus... and it's the english version and I already own the german version ... sorry, but this game more than anything was a stab in the heart for me
Egg emperor was in Generations actually
Catechumen
Only the DS version, SpadeMagnes[School].
Well the 3ds version anyway....
I still say Nega Wisp Armro should have been the modern era boss
*Armor
scvs dead jim
Here.
Prepare for a massive image.
http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402101825/sonic/images/a/af/Egg-dragoon-sonic-generations.png
The Egg Emprerror also was in Heroes... which I actually liked...
Jesus.
Lil_B, yeah- that seemed to be the general feel. I mean- it was just so broken that people felt cheated. And they never fixed it properly?
It's just icky
It's a tad more impressive than the Egg Emperor, I feel :P
See what I mean when I say I like the design of that thing, LadyCanary? :P
Yes..
o3o
Lasharus: That is quite huge but I zoomed out
I sure love blasting His World fighting that thing
I have an "Ask Dr. Robotnik" thread, and someone actually asked me: "Do you like giant mecha?"
Vivix no, but I gave up on playing it, they would hva eto make it completly new :/
yeah-
I just linked to that image, saying "look carefully, you MIGHT find me in there."
Boy I would love dlc to fight more Robotnik bosses or more stages
"hard and fast"
I'd be up for that, SpadeMagnes[School]. :P
Say what you like about Robotnik - silly, always loses, but by god does he know how to build a mech. :P
The Dreamcast era boss for 3ds makes no sense regarding Sonic never fought it
Which one was that? I didn't play the 3DS one.
Bio lizard
Am i the only one around here?
This nice chicken outside gave me this coupon: https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1353432430076.jpg
And one stage was radical highway, shadow's stage
I still wanna know hwere Eggman gets all the Metal from...
That IS sort of silly.
It's a skill, Lil_B.
I mean... dat damn Air-Fleet in Sonic Heroes...
He gets his funding from the government
omg what have i done to the paintchat ;_;
And in Sonic Unleashed.
And... well, most other ones.
He's secretly the vice president
SpadeMagnes[School] - in one game he actually runs "Robotnik Corp"
It's as if people WANT to be taken over.
I still say one robotniks early comptent designs was the lava reef machine
Shame it was self-defeating. :P
He would have won if he stopped firing mines
Anyway, I think I'm over-fanboying again.
Hello?
LOL
Zerg rush? Kekekeke?
Be nice, LadyCanary.
/me watching Watership Down "Holy Damn"
I am nice \:3/
If evil.
Pfft, you're not nice Canary ;D
Yep?

Jay moo

Reading this hurts.
And I have NO idea who you're trying to insult now Jmo. :P
My braaaand!
Jaymoo: Wait what?
Why did that trip in my mind as female.
Mooo :3
LadyCanary: Look, look with your special eyes
Whatever damn gender you are.
Eh?
>special eyes.
STILL have no idea who you're trying to insult...
1-800-Pony?!
LOL my eyes are brown.
Idk what's going on!
I'm confused!
LadyCanary: I was going with the video...:D
Holy shit, catch on faster.
My shoulder hurts! Everyone shut up!

/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
Could it have been that my internet was spazzing and it messed something up?
Am I gonna have to slap a -blam!-?
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
FAK
Ok, give me a minute
U
Well done.
Ok
Not sure if intentional...
/me slaps them both with a ice cream
Hehe
You figure it out for yourself.

You don't much like explanations, do you? :P
!cd
Episode 4 of season 3 "One Bad Apple" airs in 3 days, 21 hours, 49 minutes, 48 seconds (Nov 24 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
I'll explain when it is worthy.
Translation: When I damn well want to and it doesn't seem silly.
Yes, I'm still a git.
Yeah sorry it is doing it now to, my internet is playing up... :|
ok, turns out I don't have to watch my cousins, back
That's nice. :)
WHO is this person?
For the fans of the Sonic Comic series - the head of intelligence.
(Archie comics, that is)
Doubt there're many, but hey, I can try.
I like Archie comics :3
Whoo!
What is this big monster whih pissing at building with green maze ?
Who the hell gave you candy and kool-aid for the sugar rush.
Actually, I hate the Archie comics, but the sonic series the company does isn't too bad, LadyCanary. :P
I wanted to read those comics, but I heard there was so much confusing plot points
Welcome to Planetside, Rocket
Oh yes, it's about as logical as a concrete octopus, Deacon. :P
Oh yeah, Lasharus xD
kool-aid? I'm not in the US. I prefer a nice cup of Earl Grey, thank you.
...Also, you remind me a lot of this dude from my school. He's a pretty big Sonic fanboy as well.
Oh god Netherlands, really?
inb4 you are him
ROBOTNIK Fanboy.
Important difference there.
Oh :o
And yes, I'm from the Netherlands. I speak more English than Dutch though.
stop fanboying here or i'll turn on my engines
That's super.
MLP_Brovakiin: When did you get banned?
I don't see you in the bans list
Vroom vroom
Back, what did i miss?
/me fires engine
you missed a lot
:L
I feel bad for you
A lot of randomosity, RaveBrony.
Nooo D:
There was some fanboying, an utterly silly discussion after that, and so on.
Ah, im sure there will be plenty more throughout the day, lol
RaveBrony: also a trout fight
Hah, good ole Bronystate
Not enough minerals.
When did you last join IRC without being banned?
lali-ho RaveBrony
like an hour ago?
Hey Deacon :)
when I got in from school I tried :S
it let me in then
ok ... scrap Watership down "Felidea" is awesome : D
An hour ago?
No bans have been set on the channel for 5 hours
about that, yeah
Oh :/
And I don't see you on the bans list
Anyway, I think I'll just go sit back and have dinner, what with my urge to silly discourse being over with for the day.
I really don't know what is happening
You enjoy that, Lasharus :P
Oh definitely.
It might just be my internet, it is being changed over this week so I am on one of the BT open zones, might that effect it
But since I work in customer service these days, my brain does need the occasional break.
"So I paid tuition fees. When do I get them back?"
Oh :L
Last thing I see from you
"...um... you don't?" "WHAT!? I'LL LEVEL A COMPLAINT AT YOU!"
You ghosting yourself
LOL
Planetside 2 unlocks in 12 minutes. What are the chances that Wrek is gonna start trying to download it in that time?
(actually happened)
Oh, I am not sure :S
I got to intern at a computer helpdesk last spring xD
Or, of course:
Try joining now
"So, your education, is it HBO, MBO, or University? (Dutch terminology)" "Yes!"
Nope :S
"Uhhm, my computer doesnt turn on, i pressed the button and nothing happens"..... "Did you plug it in?"......."Oh..."
Sometimes I wish I could slap people through my mic.
sorry...
That one's always a classic. :P
Ikr?
"So, the loan, I don't have to pay that back, right?"
Huh
I don't understand that
Hahaha, wut
Yeah. That one was quite interesting to manage.
You know what? Maybe I'm cut out for that line of work.
heya Wrek long time no stream man!
I am on one of the open zone internet connections, could that be it?
lali-ho otakon
BLOW UP ALL THE BUGS! YEAAAAAAAAH!
"So, can I apply for low-income additional funding?" "Lemme check" *looks into parent's income* "Your dad makes 350.000 a year. How about no."
Deacon: why no more Dken?
Hey there, otakon!
hiya RaveBrony
otakon felt like it
But Zerg are so cute. :<
Hey Otakon.
Kandarihu: Try it, all you have to do is have patience
Of course you would think that Meanwhile
Shizuschlafen is asleep
Post Giant Weta pics :P
In fairness btw, the call center I'm at is governmental, so quality is relatively higher, and the callers aren't ALL blithering idiots. Which is superb quality, compared to commercial call centers. :P
Don't worry about it
They aaaaarrreeee. Look at their cute little mouths with their cute little teeth and their big tendrils of drool. <3
I bet it is my connection, but thanks anyways :)
I'll ask around about it
RaveBrony, and a self-repairing heart to help people who don't know what they're talking about but think they do.
08,01mmm, tail call recursion
/me 08,01drools
I wouldnt be surprised if you found headcrabs cute Meanwhile
thanks :)
08,01is it wrong that i find recursion a turn on?
Those're cute too. See how they scuttle.
Those that call helpdesk are insanely uneducated....
for computers anyway
Venus: okay why are you suddenly Venus?
Well, I work at the ministry of education, RaveBrony. I suppose SOME education is involved, mostly. :P
I like whacking them with my crobar. It's like playing baseball :3
Kandarihu: Indeed, lol
08,01otakon: because i'm Venus
Lasharus: Yeah :P
Plus, whenever they jump I can't help but hear "HUG MEEEEEEEE"
Sailor Venus! :3
Venus: but you're not the Roman Goddess of Love dammit!
VenHur: you're a six foot hairy half Indian Scotsman!
who says he isn't?
Maybe you'd like to find out otakon? ;33333
no
no I would not
/me giggles
Hah
how many times I gotta say it! I DON'T LIKE GUYS
So tempting to hug you now.
otakon: ya tabfailed hard there
A little bit
/me 08,01licks otakon

sorry VenHur
:L
08,01it's okay, i can be a girl for you, otakon
/me washes off with bleach and steel wool
You really can't.
O_o
Hey Venus :D

O....O
Oh i never did greet you, Venus, hiya!
Lol, Meanwhile
Meanwhile haha
08,01hey RaveBrony!

08,01MadSurge: what gives me away?
The creepy.
You spin me right round!
08,01shit, i knew i should have turned that off.
Venus: your incredible beauty? :D
^
http://i.imgur.com/dWPme.gif
I feel that's still relevant.
Who is streaming, and what is he/she playing?
Wheeee
08,01i'll explain the venus this: i've been recently using Venus to RP as female
BronyDarth: Wrek is, and it's Planetside
08,01i even made a Venus OC
Wrek's streaming, he's playing Starcraft 2.
Go Wrek!
Venus: :D
Is it just me, or am I always there when Wrek is streaming.
Venus: Nice, hahaha
Or atleast 95% of the time..
Venus so youre girl or a man ?
I have to make my OC still
Or draw it anyway
08,01RaveBrony: yes

Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: You Now Have a Mirror Pool
:o
It's 7 in the afternoon and he got dinner first now?
then i will watch Pownys the Anthology 2
So I guess this means that Wrek is now the second mod to brand his streams, right?
my brand!
Shizuka = Cathedral Zero Productions : Wrek = The Wrek Sessions
08,01hmm
http://store.steampowered.com/app/218230/ Alright guys! PS2 is ready to go!
I suppose
So those of you whose computers can handle it, GOGOGOGOGOGO!
i would make over 2 mio clones and make a army
Kandarihu: It wont let me download it! Lmao
08,01i wonder if i can confuse GCC with a recursive call to a static inline function...
huh isent letting me dl it
Same...
Oh right. That's to be expected. This is the way games ALWAYS come out on Steam. The download becomes possible a few hours after the Play Game button appear
Nah, its just not doing anything :I
Darn
There's always http://www.planetside2.com/
the site isent loading for me
NOr for me, i already tried it xD
*Nor
le sigh
You gotta keep trying. I got it.
Grrr
there server are just overwhelmed atm
I want it naooo
down! everything down!
lol
Guess its TF2 until it dies down :I
And you know what? My computer can't handle this game. Whenever I tried launching the beta, it took a quick look at my GPU and said "Nnnope"
emm guys, what do you know about Mic ? coz i enjoy his music, and then i heard that he had some altercations with some people :X
Mic?
micthemicropheno ofc :D
Oh, i dont listen to brony music that much :I
Doesnt interest me.
:(
I prefer older techno and trance :P
i liked his music, and he was one whih bring me to this whole MLP :P
gahhhh this is so annoying

change your steam download location to shift server
so idk
steam has many download servers
How to change download location?
/me checks
Steam -> Settings -> Downloads + Cloud
and download region
Mines set to sweden, apparently
05as is mine :3
woo
Vivix, so... theoretically could I download the english fallout new vegas version with a german key?
And what do you mean set it to shift servers
I--don't think so
Sweet! Downloading <3
Wrek can you not update planetside from the beta to the release?
aw
you download your version, I suppose, just from another server
i had a half day of school today :) that is all....
omg thanks that totaly worked
Alordex, just change to another country,t osee if that wants to download
k
Country, or city in USA?
Does it matter?
Don't think so, just something else and hope it's not full
if you choose something really far away, it might be slower, but yeah, that's about it I guess
Heya everbrony
okie
Hiya
Hai Vivix :)

Hiya Everlasting_Joy
Hello LadyCanary!
'Lo Everlasting_Joy.
05but yeah
Howdy Meanwhile!
05facign 20 years for taking photographs is beyond ridiculus
it's a common law
brb going to area 51
Wow :L
Oh hey, Everlasting_Joy :)
Howdy RaveBrony!
so how did u come across this anyways?
u know em?
arma3 developers
Probably on the news
it was all over the net when they got arrested, especially in the arma fandom
unless these are two other guys who took illegal pictures of army-bases
dem hippies
What do i put in the 'message' section?
ofcourse it's way too harsh with 20 years, but smashing their cameras and shipping them out? That would make sense
I dont think you have to put anything in there, RaveBrony.
/me sneaks into chat >.>
RaveBrony, you write in there what you think about all that
It's optional.
hay thelonepony
i could understand a hefty fine 2 but ya any long jail time is dumb
Hi Invi :)
especially in this case
/me glomps LadyCanary
Greece is full of bullshit, what Espionage could they have been doing,
jail time would make sense if they were employed by another country, as spies,
but they weren't
/me is glomped.
Oi
SpadeMagnes[School], if you take a camera to an army base, you'll find out
Heya thelonepony :)
heya, hows you?
:)
Ohai MLP_Brovakiin :)
:3
Howdy thelonepony!
Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
Well, I tried using the Steam "Play Game" button for Planetside 2, and it's working now. So go ahead guys. Planetside 2 can now be downloaded from Steam.
Just about every variation of download is fussy atm.
If only I could get Planetside 2 to work on my laptop >w<
>_>*
Well first of all, isnt Greece bankrupt? What could they fucking possibly have worth sending "spies" to preform Espionage
You do know they are guilty of espionage in some degree, right?
It's not a question of if, it's a question of "do they deserve that punishment, when etc"
:L
They probably do
I can't imagine a country that would let you take pictures of their army bases
=__=
I mean, 20 years is too much when they're not actually spies, but noone would let you leave with the camera
Why were they taking photos to begin with?
Hmm
Well, first they said it was for the game
then they said it was a vacation
and now I have no idea what they're saying
is it a military prison or maxium or low security
woops forgot i had this open, going to head out, need a nap didnt sleep well last night
no idea~~
Night OmegaSlayan :)
Ok if they found they had no "spy" equipment on them, how do they have any hold on this case? They clearly didnt have any espionage gear with them
waht the hell?
camera?
They had a camera, that's enough
That stuff is easily obtainable though
taking picture of 'secret bases' or military things, is illegal
they took pictures, they were arrested
hmm no stream
Well if it was illegal why did they do it in the first place?
What are we talking about?
05casue all millitary stuff is in the backround out of focus
maybe they didn't know, maybe they didn't think it was a big deal
were all dl'ing planetside right now powny
Thats kinda asking for trouble
05there are bases close to the airports in geece even
05takign an image on the airport of your family on vacation
05and you are likely to snap a jetfighter in the backround
Huh.
huh
Weird.
05but the whole situation is very muddy anyways
I heard they were on the island, taking pictures for inspiration for the game
So if its all out of focus how the shit is any of this case justified?
then changed their story after arrest
05as i said
05its muddy
05as hell
yeah-
You know what? Fuck greece
i don't know if it's justified, but I think 20 years is way too much when the circumstances are what theyseeem to be
^
Well even if they don't willingly release these guys, we can't expect this situation to be anything remotely the same 20 years from now.
And if these guys were monitoring them the moment they got on the island, why didnt they stop them then?
05takign close up images wont give oyu anythign anyways
05GPS adn sattelites, even google already know
google did get in trouble over that, but mostly with regimes
So let them sue Google :P
like--myanmar
and china-
Maybe that'll solve their issues.
05pfft
And regardless if its illegeal or not what the shit could Greece POSSIBLY have that is worth sending "spies"
I think it's fine, army should be allowed to censor air-iamges
dang google, always getting away with stuff :P
05who would want to know anythign about greece millitary
05they're broke
Hello LadyCanary! How are you? :)
doesn't matter what it's worth
Last I heard they are bankrupt
so sending spies would be pointless
and that does not change anything
Alright.
05jsut saying
Wrek: :D
05apple should buy greece
True.
05and start with iCheese
Hehehe
Even if it is illegeal, you wouldent get shit out of the event
05iGoat
Still illegal
05and OLiVE
-.(\
thr first icountry ^^
soon, iEurope
Vivix: Regardless spying would only be worth it if they fucking had something
OOPAH!
doesn't change anything SpadeMagnes[School]
O U Wrek
Yea I know but again, they wouldent send spies unless Greece had something worth spying on...
probably not
Vivix: Than, iWorld.
If they did it's not likely to be common knowledge is it.
AWw Yeah, next after that? iMoon
There probably ar spies in every country
But Greece is broke, what the fuck could their military even have
Or maybe iTwinkies. Oh wait.
I doubt Greece has nukes lying around in the base
iHorse and iHuman
05irobot
05OMG
I DID NAWT MURDER HIM
EETS BOOLSHET EETS NAHT TROO
What is it Wrek?
Oh hi mark
08,01I DID NAAAAAAAAAT
Haha--oh man, that's the only meme that makes me laugh almost every time
05it onyl first now struck me that iRobot is an apple reference
....
Suuuuure
Oh my god.
Wrek: it isn't......
DUN DUN DUN
iRobot?
08,01iRobot?
05the movie?
/me makes a cricket noise
no
VenHur: Oh hi Mark- I mean Venus.
05always read it as I, Robot
I, Robot
damn guys
05but still
Yeah the movie is based on the book, which was around before apple.
I robot, U robot
We robot
I Robot existed well before Apple did
from an Isaac Asimov novel
i know what movie im suggesting this week
....
05that doesnt matter really
hell Asimov came up with the 3 laws didn't he?
^
08,01Wrek: you know it was "based" on an Asimov book from 1950, right?
Zoom zoom roboda.
08,01of the same name
05venus
05im jsut sayin
05that whoever made that cover
05for the bluray
05made a funny
Meanwhile: Boom Boom, Roboda, Roboda.
08,01ah, i see it now
Oooooh
08,01i've never seen the film
08,01because i'm one of the world's biggest asimov fans
05i know its and movie of a book of a something
Bc it's actually a pretty good movie
05that wasnt
05waht i was "questioning" as it were
When you love a book, you hide from the movie
Venus: it's in name only too
i love harry potter books and i watched the movies...
05but its still a good movie ^_^
same- actually
LoTR too
The IRobot movie didnt do the books any justice imo.
05which is what worries me about bilbo
Wumbo
Changing planets are we?
1...2...
3...
cue Spock singing Bilbo
05bilbo was probably my first voluntary read
Ooh~~
05so with the movie close
05ermegerd
Well, LoTR movies did, in most cases, do the book justice- hopefully same can be said for the hobbit
05right
hoepfully
05the titled it the hobbit
ive seen a summery for the hobbit. its was meh
05not bilbo
Hobbiten it was called in Norwegian, the book
05w/e
Im worried that it will be a 3 parter...
It is a 3 parter
it will be, I think they said so
perhaps, it is a massive journey- we'll see
they are adding stuff from other books, not just the hobbit.
Simlarilion?
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: In A Tavern, Down By The River
yeah
Im guessing by other books you mean the silmarils
jeesus teach me how to spell ktxh
I wonder why Peter Jackson did so well
look at his track-record of splatter movies
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGF5ROpjRAU - this? :)
Silmarillion O__O Five times smaller than the Lord of the Rings, ten times more complicated to read
it sema like there is no stream

oh Lord, I tried to read Silmarillion, it was like reading the appendix in LoTR
05there will be a stream once this is finished downloading
05that i can guarantee

05if its me streamign or not
Vivix: I like that he tried to worldbuild, but TOO MANY NAMES O_O

SpadeMagnes[School]: We know, we hear it every friday/saturday :D
Vivix: no
Kiss greeting, seen that many times

I wonder if Planet side 2 is bigger than my 20GB WoW

And bah, eating pasta without cheese sucks
Alchemist did someone ever said to you in the Laboratory, "Here hold this, I need to wash my hands" gives you a flask and you feel that there was some kind of solution around it that you now got all over your hands as well?
