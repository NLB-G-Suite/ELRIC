Hello Everyone.
Ninjazz: NO!
night all
everyPONY
hai Ninjazz
Good Shiner Boch only available during summer is thier Ruby Redbird - with Rio Grande Grapefruit - if you can find it, get some :)
I watched it. It was Fluttershy screaming. I had no idea what it was so I forgot about it. Until in a review of an anime I was watching had a clip from MLP FiM. I then found out all about bronies and such
Om: Maybe?
LightningDashFast what's a pony? is that some sort of german salad?
i don't know. everypony sounds kind of forced. You say it even when there's dragons or owls around
Ninjazz: If you say so.
also BlueFlare

10Them UKers staying up until 3am
3am or gtfo
LightningDashFast: Just for clarification, everypony only replaces everyBODY. Everyone is fine.
10Nope
I grew hate for them. Thinking I would never watch the show. But then 1 day A classmate of mine convinced me to watch the show.
Ninjazz: :| <--- Just for you
10I've been going to bed as early as 10:30 o.o
Om: You're too kind. -__-
once you watch one ep Ponies47 its all over
so now we have twilightlicious,flutterlicious and now pinkielicious:O
Ponehs
Ninjazz: Oh stop it you~
10I dunno where this pattern came from, I'm waking up early cuz of it too
Teh ponies command meh ._.
Heh.
Ninjazz!
LightningDashFast: WHERE?! Where is Pinkalicious?
10I stayed up until almost midnight yesterday, still woke up early
107am early :<
My brony story is that a friend of mine pressured me into watching an episode of mlp while at school, which i couldn't finish. I then watched a few more episodes while at home and looked deeper into the community. Then BAM. Brony. Overnight, practically
on eqd
So I went home and watched an episode thinking it was gonna be the dumbest thing ever. I WAS WRONG. My first episode was Lesson Zero. I fell in love with the show about 5 min in.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=g-all-f
so everyone's passing their brony origins eh?
11,01-+
/me hugs Ninjazz
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&feature=related
10What day will you return from San Fran?
11,01Ponies47 is ticking!
LightningDashFast: :) that made my day
The rest of that weekend all I did was watch pony episode after episode until I had watched every episode that was out at the time.
youre Welcome
y u no stay up late
/me lestens to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfMb50dsOk&feature=related
Then I realized. I WAS A BRONY
DISCORD
we need an applejack emote
yeah, mine is a bit more pedestrian
i know LightningDashFast
10Y u care
Ponies47: I just can imagine your facial expressions during that. "Why is the purple pony going insane? In a girls' cartoon?"
i tried to make one but it was crap :D
I found it odd that SO many people had MLP avatars on The Escapist site
so I asked
raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa next video
plz
and then I got told a new series came out
I saw a couple of PMV's
the punch has been spiked
lol
Does anyone know any good RP chatrooms? If so, please PM me
how goes?
then I watched the first ep
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrOXVeZh84k&feature=g-all-u Rainbow Escape
this was me when I discovered ponies https://twitter.com/DKen2021/status/132993044151668736
I was very scared. What would my friends think. What would they say?!? I keept it secret until anthor day. Anthor classmate convinced to come outta my shell. So I did. I was soon telling everybody I was a brony and the more I did the more proud I became of being one.
and then I came here and after that I have found something to enjoy
I think I found my new alarm clock music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGaCH-JRbEc
brb guys
I'm not in SF
I'm in LA
also, tomorrow.

And now. I'm a full time brony who loves the show and hangs out with you guys here.
THE END
Spade-Magnes HEY LISTEN HEY LISTEN HEY LISTEN :3

MaidSurge: I was thinking that
So did you like my story? :3

d3rb: Thank you. I love being a brony. :)
/me is back
Ponies47: I went chronologically because I already knew I would like the show :D
Ponies47: I like dat story
Welcome back sagas

Ninjazz: Did you still want to see that vid of me unboxing and brushing Rarity?
thanks Ponies47 :)
Pinkies4thWall: EYESH! PLZ!
Ever look at your best friend and wonder, "I could totally make him a brony!"
MaidSurge: I had the same fealing. I was like I'm pretyy sure after I watch this I'm gonna be a brony and I was right.
Dat response
MahBoi777: Thanks :)
i wonder how this fandom grew so big in such a short time
*pretty
Ninjazz: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJT-WKb7dNU&feature=plcp
who knows?
because ponies

Ponies47: I already liked Foster's Home so :D

11,01I watched ponies and liked them. That's my story. :p
,,,
11,01Lol.
/me claps
that was beautiful Nittany_Discord
wsirc.mobi for playstation wee ;)
Nittany_Discord that is a very drama heavy story there
I first came across and was interested in the Mulan "Be a Man" PMV
My story is complex and odd. None of you would care to see it though.
Nittany_Discord: I watched ponies, liked them, bought swag. That's my story
i liked the protagonist in it
Nittany_Discord I cried at the end. So powerful. :(
ahem SWAG
11,01It is a great story.
Ninjazz: you were a hater and then you weren't
Lolfail
The worst part in becoming a brony in my story was telling the friend that showed me the episode, which I kept on saying was stupid
Ninjazz: am i in the ball park
MaidSurge: I like Fosters home. But Twilight going crazy. I would never think of that happening in a little girls show. Lesson Zero is one of my favorite episodes of all time. It made me a brony and I find crazy Twilight funny. I want more crazy Twilight in season 3 :)
DRF, I told my mother about the DSTWO and she was like, "Another present? Really?"
:V
3am + boredome + internet = Ponies = Om
That episode was Winter Wrap Up, and it's among my favorite episodes now

That's actually good
Videofreak1127[M]: it's coming

Ponies47: Pinkie's madness not being played for laughs made me go "wow, they're being serious about insanity in a cartoon? :D"
11,01Formerly Equestria Online.
my story
MaidSurge: I know that was awesome.

Spectrum_Rush: Go ahead :)
Possibly
was that the story Spectrum_Rush ? i like it if it was
ug
*uh
owlicious: YAY :)
did you say I'll pay? :P
I never got into MLP until Season 2. I saw small clips from S1 but it didn't do anything for me. Then I somehow heard about Derpy and was like "They really named a MLP character Derpy?" I looked it up and saw that it was a fan name, but then The Last Roundup happened. First clip of the Derpy scene I saw was the one from here with the chat reactions.
No
Because you're not
:P
Hoo?
well try that

I said I would

It won't work ;-;

about chatting with people overseas
sec :P
Nittany_Discord: Sorry it's a bit of a late reaction, but is there an announced date for the releases of the RPGs?
The whole Derpy thing plus seeing your reactions got me interested into the show, so when I found out the chat reactions were coming from here I started to regularly sit in and watch the episodes
08,01it's really creepy; the premise behind Watch Dogs is pretty much *exactly* that of a scifi short i've been planning the skeleton of for the last week or so
11,01I have no clue when they are coming out.
room full of pony merch isnt enough
ok
yeah my "story"
thanks anyway

There are only ten doctors
05the plot thickens

MasterBoss43 originally, yes, but then James Cameron's Avatar made Avatar copyrighted

HUZZAH for recaps!
EA needs a lot more of a deathblow than just stocks, Nitt. I know you want them dead. I wouldn't mind it myself. But you need something concrete. Divisions closing, less games, etc.
nom
12Mooo
good. It wouldn't make sense
but The Last Airbender still has Avatar in its name
Nittany_Discord: It's ok :)
Nittany_Discord: what was it about this time :)
Hell, Nintendo's stock went down after E3, IIRC.

Lunar_Boy Ok, this is actually weird couse i have ONLY watched the after avatar.....
But they ain't dying. >_>
08,01CriticKitten: as i said, a little nitrate...

05EA jsut needs a change in management
11,01Bioware will die.
11,01Wrek: Agreed.
08,01i'm thinking of chopping my hair off
SWTOR. That's all I gotta say. They're lost to us.
psh he doesnt have his 85 gear
Nittany_Discord: hmm
CriticKitten: WHAY!?
MasterBoss43 you should watch the original. Not only is a great show, but it will help you understand this series
Bioware is DEAD TO ME.
CriticKitten: BUT WHY!?
dat face
Why? You could dye it like... pinkie pie?
11,01Current EA management will kill EA.
Wrek: EA merely needs soul
otakon: Because SWTOR.
What is love?

I'm burning myself out from studying so much
08,01cow334: i condition my hair like a mofo
Wrek pinged me, its time to have a party.

Otakon, you do know that most of Black Isle went on to form Obsidian, right?
FlareChaser: Lolwut? Whats the big deal? :D

YIPYIP

05thats one hell of a damage
DEER everywhere
Spectrum_Rush doubt it. the reason it crashed in 83 cause gaming was such a niche industry. Now that it's more mainstream, it would be hard to
FlareChaser: Bwahaha, ok :D

08,01Wrek: i bleached it 3 times in the space of a week

Dken2021: anything is possible

CriticKitten: (rimshot)
So DRF, remember that Un owen was her crazy piano MIDI?

Well, I can see the attraction.
MAGNETS HOW DO THEY WORK?
Pinkies4thWall: nopony knows
Spade-Magnes: Bullets are made of metal, unless you want them to use wooden bullets
00,10not the psycop
MasterBoss43: Is it your birthday today? :)
Oh what, are the magnets made of platinum too? BEND THE DAMN MAGNETS YOU FOALS.

10diet soda
so are the tanks man controlled or remote?
REJECTION
>is not immune to lightning blasts
and saying how I drink so many calories of soda
LOL COUNTING CALORIES
hmm...nice use of redirection considering lightning is majorly made up of heat
man controlled
MECHAS HOW DO THEY WORK
this isn't weight watchers
dken2021: man controlled
10I don't keep count but
Ponies47 Nope, but i wish that it was instead of having my birthday in the winter. (My bithday is at March the 13 friday) So i am joking that i am the bad luck because my birthday is on friday the 13'een.....
10I do look at nutrition labels when I can :P
/me poker faces
Rarity is so bad ass.
05needs more red army tesla tanks
It actually played perfectly.
Ingwaz that is probably how Firebenders can also bend Lightning
00,10so does that count as a nutshot?
LOL NUTrition labels
FUS RO DAH
Wrek: so Korra is a She/he? if i understand you right?
13needs moar mammoth tank?
FIRST TIME EVAH

oh snap
10that's bad
That mustache wearing guy gets around.
10:P
Seriously, he's EVERYWHERE.
look who you're talking to
Nittany_Discord: indeed it is, but its very very hot, so if you're able to control fire, and presumably heat, you could probably redirect lightning at a basic level
Nittany_Discord: well, it can also be constued as super heated gsa
10especially since they are McD's
MasterBoss43: Okie doki loki. bronystate should keep like a list of our birthdays or somthing :P
Worst time ever...
Oh the poor timing

00,10he's spoileing the show Shizuka dont listen to him

Wrek: Haha, i can agree with that! :D
DO THE MONKEY!

Spectum_Rush We are just saying that they should make Rainbow's theatre for gaming and Twilight's theatre for movies. And btw, Spike's theatre is without chat.
Sumica prop-hunt ?
Wrek, that was a travesty, and blasphemy, there was no avatar live action movie
spoiler alert, korra kills the equalists with rosebud
Sumica: prop hunt?
00,10yep
Wrek: are you off of your meds?
THERE WAS NO LIVE ACTION MOVIE!
Spectrum_Rush: So your arguement is invalid.
wuw

MasterBoss43: take up with the mods then

You might think that ponies get their cutie marks when they learn their special talent. It's actually something else which happens as most ponies grow up. Unfortunately, the CMC never realize this.
whats an earth bender going to do way up there?
13I AM THE TABLE

RaveBrony, So sweet....dawwww...:D
/me has candy legos
Nope
:(
GOD
[SWAG]thehated5689: quite a bit :/
CriticKitten: would seem to have something to do with genetics, otherwise continuing the line of airbenders is left up to complete chane, and how is it controlled?
DANG
hold on
wahts goig on with the busys?
Pinkies4thWall: THose are the shiz!!!
[SWAG]thehated5689: nothing too important though ^_^
Ingwaz: It's cultural. Fire and Earth benders both lived in the same town, which led to the birth of families that have both Fire and Earth bender.
:P
Pinkies4thWall: Candy legos?
wouldnt the air get stale in there?
00,03Oh look, I left this on -_-

:O:O:o
00,02wow
dat twist
:o:O:o
Ingwaz: It's not genetic, it's cultural. The family whose spirituality you're born into determines your probability of bending a given element.
Shyyyyyyyt

O_O
00,02i had that spoiled but not in this datail
that explains the resist bloodbending

Ninjazz, What?!
12wbsAvis
Gender benders

BusyWithDance: Surprise brother!
what?
RaveBrony LOL
That's why there's a lot of non-benders living in the dorms at the air temple, in the hopes that them living like the Air Nomads of old will allow them to give birth to airbenders.
wait, what did I miss?
aww man i wont be able to see this i got to fo

Ingwaz: Regardless, the writers have said it's cultural.
Ingwaz: And not genetic. :P
[SWAG]thehated5689: that sounds interesting to say the least XD
Nuuuu Aang voice
CriticKitten: i dont really see how anyone couldnt become a bender then
That aint right
hooray for Katara!
damn you katara
Ingwaz: It's based on spirituality.
go Katara
hahahahaha
im back
[SWAG]thehated5689: well welcome back ^_^
Ingwaz: Live like the people, and your family has the potential to give birth to a bender of that element.
father of the year right there
Wow...
dat purpose
now I feel sorry for those kids
CriticKitten: could you not simply accept a different culture and gain the chance of becoming a bender?
Avenge!
MahBoi777: who's taking over?
It's a cultural thing, based on the spirituality of the individuals in question.
MOOOOO
:'(
this could be fun
lol
Ingwaz: No, you're a bender or you're not at birth.
I wish I was a bender :<
CriticKitten: just doesnt really make sense to me...
Ingwaz: But your KIDS could become a particular bender depending on how you live.
moo
whoa

Ninjazz: did you like the vid?
Ingwaz: Like I said, it's not genetic, it's how you live. Benders can be born into a family with no benders in it.

damn that looks painful
Holy shit
00,10oh just that

Blood bend your father! :D
CriticKitten: then i fail to see why one cant become a bender after birth
It is MahBoi777 ...

Instead of California Gurls
Ingwaz: Because you're either born with it or not.
It should be California Blonds
:P
Dick.
RaveBrony: mfw:D
so, i take it amon's ability to remove bending comes from blood bending?
California Moronic Drivers?

02seeya drf
Damnit Korra
there are, and i would forgive him...if he acutally watched the show alittle and then hated on it, he just made fun of bronys from old series
what a player
But its crazy how much information we need to learn in such a short time
Honestly, I would have preferred if they started over here. And had her re-learn the elements. Instead....we get....THIS ENDING. *grrrrr*
How old is that man and how young is his wife?
Quicksilver those are decendants of their repsective bending, thus she can't do it
Do i have the brony comunity's permission to smack him?
Om nom nom
but all the love movesi know involve bending ...i cant
i guess
05his wife is 15, hismelf is 76

I get the metal, but how does fire lead to lightning?
Best line EVER coming up guys. I'm serious. Best line EVEEER.
w00t! first comment on an eqd post!
Wrek: lol...
Wrek: seems right
it should be possible to ... unlock your chi points to enable bending again

I hate this fricking ending.

that was AWESOME
The Avatar Giveth and the Avatar taketh away.
WHAT HAPPENED?
MY FACE HURTS FROM THE EPICNESS
Energy Bending trumps Blood Bending ANY GODDAMN TIME!
Why is it cool that this 76 year old guy has got a 15 year old wife?
11,01That lady got her bending back.
Seriouse Deus ex
YAAAAY!
NOOOOOOO NOT CREDITS
:D
Wooot!!!
DID THEY KISS
TEH END
11,01That's where I am.
NOW KISS-spike
Sumica: So....thats it?
SpeedyBolt: bending came back
0,14my problem with this is that it makes for a good series finale
00,10so they could have a s2 or not.
My lips hurt so much now! :D
d3rb: one of the rules is, drink when ever any unicorn or alicorn uses magic
mish: Aang was the first ever to deny anyone bending-- FireLord Ozai. Figures an Avatar could fix it.
0,14not a good season finale
I saw the bending
Cipher: thats why this show is awesome
Of course
Cipher: yeah, the HELL will they do for next season?
Ingwaz: how are you still alive :O
How many episodes were there!?! :[
02if you're still there, how much money are you willing to pay for a camera?
7.5/10
12
RaveBrony: man
12
Pinkie/10
...Where in Tartarus do they go from here?
9.6/10
10/10
RaveBrony: many excuse me
00,10I think it's KSP time
00,02inb4 avatar IN SPACE
11/10
lol
d3rb: 3 shots down already...and only 3 minutes in
Cipher: Considering that Korra is now equally powerful to Aang, yeah, it's kind of a terrible way to end the first season. Aang took 61 episodes to do what Korra just did in 12.
Sumica: with commentary?
actually Kencolt Aang learned it from a dragon turtle (or whatever)
I really want to see Tartarus in Season 3 :p
DRAKE
otakon: Haha :D
/me pokes Drake
DRAKE
dude
04hey NS
get on my net
04oh
I was going to talk to you there
04right
0,14eeyup
but then I had to switch here
:|
04shadow isn't working
and we never got to find out what happened to Zuko's mom :P
Well, even though bending is returned, there is still the "equality revolution" that will happen regardless, but now without the option of taking away bending....death and impressionment is higher chance
But...that'd just be cheap
CriticKitten: she's a prodigy, she learned the other elements WAY faster than even Aang did in comparison
So, sorry, I know people like this ending, but I *hate* it. Too many problems with it.
. . . now I have to catch up on Avatar . . . again
CriticKitten: aang had a penis, which was drawing blood from his brain causing him to not be able to think as much
02XD
So now she made it better for them to fight...but worse if they lose
So Phase4!! Is blur worth buying? :3 Ive been away all day and didnt get to see whether you played it or not
:P
mish: yeah, but without it's leader it'll be HELLA lot weaker
yah
okay guys
Ingwaz . . . what the hell
0,14Amon's defeated (and most likely dead), Korra's the Jesus role now
CriticKitten: OTOH, Korra already KNEW Firem, water, and Earth bending. She didn't have nearly as much to learn, and she didn't have an entire nation hunting her down.
it's 12 am
win some you lose some
0,14what next?
Lunar_Brony: i like to keep it random
Cipher: eeyup, finishing off the remnants and restoring bending
time to watch Aang?
Now Korra needs to learn Bloodbending
So she'll be an overpowered goddess
Okay guys, I'm off to bed I'm afraid
Kencolt: And that's the problem. There's now no villain to help develop the characters and Korra is Jesus.
now korra needs to learn metalbending
gnight otakon! take care
Where do you go now?
night otakon
seeya otakon
Bye otakon :(
Cya otakon!! You have a good sleep!

now they go to SPACE!!!!!

Chat derp back :)
LOVING this music!! MMMM!!!
I understand
so, night all take care
You get your sleep :p
alright, this makes 5 shots in 4 minutes, i'm putting a limit of 9 shots just for safety sake on this episode
oh sweet, kerbal sacrafice program
Night otakon :)
Your main character is officially as powerful as Aang, and they just kicked the ass of a bloodbender, which is the most overpowered bending type there is. There is NOWHERE to go now.
/me waves bye to otakon
nighty otakon
Understand everyone, that she will have a problem: She has to fight people who can't fight back, and she must balance lives of innocent revolutionaries who only wanted eqaulity with the casulatiy rates they cause to innocent benders
goodbye otakon
Trust me
CriticKitten: THEY GO FOR GOD!
it occurs to me...how am i still fully conscious?
CriticKitten: I agree that the series was too short, but it was good. The problem is they started too far in, not that the story was bad
so Sumica landed on mun yet
They'll think of something
fancy
Her power will mean nothing to how she much think about things
00,10I have hit it
Ingwaz: how are you?
Sleep is for the weak
yo otakon
This was the first season, a second season is already greenlit.
Gotta go to space
00,02oh neat
Sumica: :D
CriticKitten: I mean, it might as well be with that ending
00,02 a shuttle
CriticKitten: That remains to be seen. After all, Book one implies a Book 2, and... these guys do have a heck of an imagination.
What is this?.
02Because I could just recommend a camera that cost $$$$ and it would be perfect for you :3
So now the problem is: what do you DO with that season?
hey everypony
/me hides
CriticKitten: They can always bring a villain from the spirit world? I dunno, I'm with you on this.
Space space, i'm in space. SPAAAACE SPAAAACE!
Ponies47: well, the thing is I've been on and off the computer for damn near TEN HOURS that is WAY too long for me in one stretch
AND BLASTOFF!
hi Sketch_Toku_Brony
WEEEEE
so, bye guys take care
hey Sketch_Toku_Brony
u too otak
otakon: I see. Well then goodnight :P
CriticKitten: Your right. Season 2 will suck so much because of this. But season 1 was good
00,02CriticKitten, after that, they'll figure something out
Their main character is Jesus, and there's no realistic one-element bender that can top a no-limits bloodbender.
So....what kind of villain can you cook up?
dat Sumica voice
Time warp?
hello disembodied voice of Sumica
finaly
00,02i had the amon plot twist spoiled for me and it was Still excelent
I say that they fight Mendeleev and his Polonium benders
0,14XD
i've been waiting for this all day
Oh, I know! You could add metalbenders that can actually bend fricking metals
We're going to SPACE?! HENSHIN *Fourze henshin* UCHUU KITAA! *ITS SPACE TIME!* :D
Phase4: Google... your true enemy
Guys, remeber, she has to avoid harming to many people and fight a revolution that has so many followers that yet agian she should avoid killing because of the sheer quainty of people fighting for equality due to a few bad apple benders
Spce? did you say space?
Inb4 it explodes
SPAAAAAAACE HERE I GO!
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, actualy someone told me via steam
00,02XD
RCS?
Whats RCS?
Phase4: Dick Friends... your true enemy
and she stoped the one person who could elimnate the chance of death and impressionment for innocent benders.
00,02Sumica, the command module has gyro's
Think about it
CriticKitten Metalbending is a form of Earthbending because Metal is Refined Earth, but Platinum is too refined to bend
did you make it to the moon last night?
So....
Lunar_Brony: Metal is a type of earth. >_>
that's a fail, there
Lwal
So they're all gonna die?
CriticKitten Metal is Refined Earth, so yes
If they're bending dirt, they're bending metallic components right there.
11,01I have trouble connecting control surfaces to wings in the game.
00,02Spade-Magnes, thats how a normal ksp game goes
So yeah.
And down it goes
you're off-course by . . . alot
Also, platinum being some kind of super-metal is....yeah. Dumb.

Whoever said that Sumi should make an X-wing, you are completely right
i count at least 20 instances in lesson zero that according to the pony drinking game rules require a shot...it also occurs to me that i'm watching a show about brightly colored ponies
Sumica: Build an X-wing.
didnt Phase4 already make an xwing?
also, i feel nothing when i slap my own face
ooh ooh Sumica make the SR-71 Blackbird
How hard would it be to build a Arwing?
Sumica: if you could make an A-10, Cipher and i would squee to death
Ingwaz: Drink tends to do all of the above.
TO SPACE
I bet it will still blow.......
13Screw your ships, I'm off to bed |D
TIE Fighter?
13Try not to miss me too much~
:)
04night Angel!
Spade-Magnes: Arwing? What was that from again?
Starfox
12WHAT ABOUT
DEAD
I BET ON 1000 DOLLARS IT WILL BLOW!
e _0
I bet it will veer to the right again
YEAH
night angel XD
12THE SHIP OF DREAMS
Ingwaz: i feel sorry for future you :D
12WHERE YOU AND I
11,01StarFox.
100 Bits?
12SAIL OFF TO THE SEVEN SEAS
holy shit, I was right
Spade-Magnes: That would be amazing.
needs better yaw, sumi
das a lot of boom
GIMME MY 1000 DOLLARS :D:D
1000*
Love Star Fox.
FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOX!
Reikim: i'm really intoxicated yet coherent enought that i knwo what i'm tryign to type...yet i find it hard to type it
Squee
squee
dat squee ping
Ingwaz: So basically, you should be sleeping now.
11,01Starfox 64 was one of my favorite games.
my hands do not feel like my own, and i want some white castle
It will blow up again im guessing.....
Inb4 failure
...That wing.
thats not good
LAUNCH ANYWAY
Fox? Fox are you there? FOOOOOOOOOOOOXXXXX!!!!
Nittany_Discord I got the 3DS version. So much win!
FUCK IT! Launch anyway!
:O
you said you were drinking rum, right Ingwaz????
fuck it. LAUNCH
that would do it
:D
Reikim: 9 shots in a 15 minute period, i should probably be passed out
and yess owlicious
Pinkies4thWall I like your logic
nope
Dawm
12I AM NOW HEARTBROKEN
:D
Murica?!
Daym
Nope, nope SAS doesn't do a better job
owlicious: 70 proof or 35% alcohol
Hahahahaha :D:D:D
TRY AGAIN! :D
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
one thruster is unbalanced
so Phase4 hows your space program goig now
Sumica, add more struts
Well, that blew up good
11,01Best gaming years for me were the N64 and PS2/Xbox gen.
I didn't know that was possible within the parameters of your available functions.
or the wheels are screwy
Rain: Then he will be broke, and i will be rich! :D:D:D
Sumica did you try using Duct Tape?
yay
N64 ish best system
:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
that was the nastiest tasting burp i've ever had...
Spaaaam
0,14calm down with the emotes, guys
GET ME THA BUTTA!!
12REBOOTING...
Ingwaz: :$
:'(
Lunar_Brony: my logic: Fuck structural integrity. I'm waiting for the fireworks.
12OKAY. I AM NOW FINE AGAIN.
Nittany_Discord: ^
This is the best game ever
Get 15 rolls of duct tape. The rest is history
wat
00,02Spectrum_Rush, its going interestingly
The solution here is more rockets. And duct tape. And perhaps a coat of red paint.
les do dis
INSERT COW OR DR PEPPER PROGRAM IN CD DRIVE.
sumi, it needs moar rockets.
I think my best gaming time was around the SNES era. GCN gets a close second.
11,01I'll be PC gaming next gen.
Three brave kerbals were killed when sumica used a cheap brand of duct tape.
CHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT
I'm guessing it will blow again....
Phase4: how so
Um, your left wing is broken
Custard: i'm glad someone is enjoying my predicament as much as i am
USA
00,02i'm flying a craft that relys on bugs in the sas code right now
It will blow......
More throttle
GO! GO! GO! GO!
now it will veer left
Ingwaz: Yes..
Dead
man down
needs more duct tape
Sumica: Your left wing was gimped.
Phase4: little wings?
11,01I should say exclusively PC gaming as far as new games.
*Le wild troll plane fainted*
Sumica: maybe it needs to be a pencil
How is everypony's night going?
11,01Hi sonicrainboomer259
good
00,02Spectrum_Rush, engine-less thrust
See. Gimped left wing.
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlackHole_Lensing.gif
04~~~
sonicrainboomer259 It's going great
sonicrainboomer259: Ok I guess :)
time for a walking test
good yourelf sonicrainboomer259 ??
I think it will blow again!
Phase4: good luck
00,02i'm getting 500 meters a second with no engines
00,02my bad, 572
It's hard to Facepalm with Glasses
I think trollplane doesn't like livestreams....
Sumica, because ducktape hasnt been invented on that planet
oh god
f*ck symmetry, just use Duct Tape
well...while i can walk...its very very difficult... and i had to stop myself from falling over
d3rb: after all these years i'm finally bored of DB: Raging blast
Add more engines
11,01Rain: Good theory.
Rain: Is that scientifically possible...?
Dat Normandy <3
:O
Sumica: did it crash?
who is streaming?
I like Sumi's background.
Hahahahaha, f*ck you.... XDXD
sonicrainboomer259: Sumica is
never heard of it sonicrainboomer259 , just googled it then
Build a arwing or something cool
Duct tape not invented on a planet? IMPOSSIBRU
Rain IMPOSSIBRU! Quickly, I must get to that planet with 35 rolls of Duct Tape to make a Duct Tape Making Machine!
Breaking physics, one click at a time
mica wat are you pinkie pie
and...i think it would be wise if i were to lay down now....
Sumica: just doesnt know what whent wrong
good night everypony
*went
g'night Ingwaz
G'night Ingwaz
Om: if only it were that easy
Night Ingwaz

Lunar_Brony: making a Duct Tape Making Machine out of Duct Tape?
take it easy Ingwaz
GUNBUSTER
Nighty night Ingwaz :)
I saw a Gunbuster on there. I must see it.

Sumica: Symmetry,hehehe,FUCK THAT!!! use tape dammit!!!
Om: true dat lol
Sumica: i think i have a solid title for you now
yayyay
Hm
Okay
The mic? D:
sound went
I give one /) to anyone else who watched Gunbuster and loved it to pieces.
sumi you rmic
oh dear
it flew at an angle
00,10oh phone
and now everything goes horribly wrong...maybe...
that rocket doesnt look healthy
FLY :)
that failed
Wow. Cipher, that actaully almost looks like an F-22.
again
The thrust is boucing to the left and right
d3rb: already had some....dont think i'm coordianated enough to get some more... so i'm just going to lay down now. wonder if i'll be hung over tomorrow, will be thef irst time ever since i rarely drink at all
*actually
0,14it does
00,10oh what's that Pinkies4thWall?
Sumica your physics are f*cked up
as usual
12YEP
Ingwaz: If you cannot type, you will be hungover. Massively.
12ANYWAY
12GOODNIGHT
FLY :D
Pinkies4thWall: your boned
11,01New Rainbow Dash Presents is up!
One of them looks scared
are those MMMMMMMMM Bananas?
Reikim: i'm actually capable of typing if i stop to think a bit and focus
Now 2...
Wait bathroom paus.
link?
Nittany_Discord what is that?
Gimble?
Spade-Magnes: Gimbal.
and so the USS Phallus set forth on epic adventures
Spade-Magnes: I think...
Sumica: the title? Sumica, Destroyer of Physics, Breaker of Sense.
Nittany_Discord: YES!
Reikim: its the strangest thing, i'm coherent when i focus, but overall, i'm pretty out of it. but i dont think only 9 shots will give me that bad of a hang over
Pinkies4thWall oh my
GOIN UP =D
Are we there yet?
Sumica:Do you like mmmm bananas?
Reikim: althought, i cant see worth a crap without my glasses
Spade-Magnes yeah, get out
mmmm nah!
hahaha
Ingwaz: I don't think that's the drink's fault...entirely, anyway.
Keep thrusting
that might help
Sumica: The ocean's looking inviting.
Sumica: you know that could easily be modded to closely resemble an F-22
Reikim: probably not, but i already took them off to get to bed, so to bed i go
03well, those Site Kiosk things are not very hackable LOL
good night
Cant be
I'd like to see this fall
Sumica: and that's going to stop you?
03they're password-locked in the BIOS and only boot from hard drive
g'night Ingwaz
Sumica: or do they??
0,14late Ingwaz
Oh...
Sumica, just go full thrust untill you are out of fuel! Dont even change directions!
night Ingwaz
:D
damn
Night Ingwaz. Hope you're feeling alright tomorrow.
ALL THE FUEL
why do I keep hearing Fluttershy say yay?
and then Sumica drifted upward forever
Lunar_Brony: have you looked behind you?
Lunar_Brony: He's got soundboard in the background.
Lunar_Brony: that is Sumica's ping
Go down
DOWN NOW
DOWNWARDSS
Are there places of civilization on the planet besides the Space Center? I'd like to see it... up close.
Pinkies4thWall thx
2 out of 3 astronauts have pissed themselves
o_o
so Sumica going for lunar orbit since i dont think you can land that or can you?
Are we gonna die?
sumi
definetly
Sumica: GO TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sumica failure is always an option
I want a donut right now
Lunar_Brony: ALWAYS :D
Back from bathtime paus.
Lunar_Brony: it's like this. Say Sumica, hear yay. Say sumi, hear squee. Say mica, hear Fluttershy say "Oh, my".
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Sumica: let's hear some music!!!
03hi
Pinkies4thWall thx. Gotta remember that
Oh my.... GOD! XDF

00,02i just broke physics
MasterBoss43 hell yeah
OMNOMNOM
do tell Phase4
Lunar_Brony: that's sumi's job
Gotta speed up
00,02Spectrum_Rush, the plane that needed no engines
lawl Sumica
uh huh
Lunar_Brony: Let's rock like Vinyl Scratch (Also known as DJ-PON3)
00,02Spectrum_Rush, i tried to ditch it in the water, but its so damned boyant that i kept pulling up
Screw gravity * floats up*
Pinkies4thWall to do what, give out Custard Tarts?
Phase4: How did you even manage that?
00,02while nearly at right angles to the water
k
Lunar_Brony: no. break physics
Phase4: USS Mosquito?
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAIN~
can we hear still alive again Sumica ?
See, someone said something about a new Rainbow Dash presents, but the only thing I'm seeing is that it's hidden in some arcane corner of the internet, and as much time as I don't have to watch it, i certainly don't have time to search for it THEN watch it
comeon sumi you can doit... again
00,02https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/ksp/Infinity%20I.craft heres the craft i was using, downloaded it from the ksp fourm

00,02time warped
00,02phased through the planet
so I don't suppose anyone has a more direct hint?
00,02and ended up in solar escape
00,02like dat
11,01NullRadix: I can link you to it.
00,02exactly what happened there
would be much appreciated
Collided. With the mun. Cool.

11,01It's in there.
11,01I haven't found it great so far.
they were K.I.A a second ago, Sumica!!!!
Pinkies4thWall: and break physics in the process yeah
hey hey everypony. its been a while
hey thunderclash!
hi thunderclash
Are we there yet

Thanks Nittany_Discord
Hai Gais
hey RAWRity
ohai RAWRity
11,01No problem.
Sumica: IS THIS GAME SIMPLE? OR EXTREMELY COMPLEX?
good evening RAWRity
hay RAWRity
Just got back from seeing MIB3
Decent movie.
blah screw Mibbit
I was gonna see it
Is anything happening?
didn't mean to all-caps
But they had no fucking clue what to do with the whole time travel element
Sumica deathtrap tiem?
and they switched up how time travel even worked in their own film at the end.
what
Back! :)
00,02Sumica, i still got a copy
Oh my
hahahaha
the RDPresents is funny
11,01They used time travel? Aww.
ALL THE HYPERDRIVE
slow acceleration
.
Ummmmm
Sorry i was testing sumthin
Sumica: treat your astronauts right!!!
no
Nittany_Discord: eeyup. MIB3 takes place almost entirely in 1969
and there's a pointless jetpack scene.
Sumica: did those boosters just outweigh their purpose?
literally?
00,02Sumica, mic volume is a little low
Eject the Kerbats you dont need them :3
I agree with Phase4
03dafuq
Sumica: AAAAAAAAAANNDD they hate you again XD
03who invited me to a Steam group called ENCOM JAILBREAK
the wings shouldnt be wiggling like that XD
03I mean, that's lulzy and all
Spazzy wings
The one who is smiling is high
obviously
I'm done for tonight. G'night everypony!
00,02night Lunar_Brony
Sumica: first phase must always be ejection of the capsule from the top of the craft
Good night Lunar_Brony ! Have nice pony dreams!
:)
thats not good
00,02ooo
later Lunar_Brony
00,02its like tri
BACK TO EARTH
And then he reentered orbit
I BET 10000000 IT WILL BLOW UP! :D
FIRE
Bomb The space station!
Sumica: your streams are so good that popcorn fits them
cut the power
so how bout that Legend of Korra finale?
Oooooh! XD
00,02i like how what i'm suposed to be doing is vectors
I still bet 10000000000 it will blow.....
They are all smiling because they all gonna die
00,02what i'm actualy doing is a game that heavily involves vectors
Move
00,02if math class involved me plotting courses to the mun and minmus i'd never get bored
came here to say one thing
12o-o
Dont blow up my house man

Mayday mayday

00,02Sumica, i tried that, atmosphere slows you to under 600M/s
Blow blow blow blow blow blow blow!
that look slike decent
Blow up!
RAWRity: Disappointed.
take out the terrorist base
Well the ocean looks inviting
CriticKitten: oh?
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY BOOM HEADSHOT ME!
:D
AAAAAAAAAAAAND DEAD
ded
lolo
DED
Gimme mah 100000 dollars.
evil bastard!!
RAWRity: Bad backstory for Amon, no explanation for his power, TERRIBLE copout ending.
HAXXXX
1M omaigawd this game is sooooo inaacurate
Good morning everypony
RAWRity: Good moments in between, but major flaws.
awesomesause
Sumica: USS ded
sauce*
anypony here have Bose headphones?
03woah
It had its issues, but overall I was pleased with it.
Sumica: who is best pony???
03so I set my camera to keep the lens open for 30 seconds
03went in a pitch black room
03set it on a table and pressed the shutter
Oh lawrd
OGOD
F*ck yeaaah!
03the picture actually looked as if there was light XD
omg
WHAT IS THAT MONSTROSITY
MURICA
Fuck yea
It also ends on a poor note overall, since....there's nowhere to go from here.
oh fuck!!!!!
I wonder who are that crazy to be in it.
ALLRIHT the Sumi -roket
I love this one
I think it will blow up some times....
Ohlard
Unlimited Tower
CriticKitten: IIRC, they had written out that to be the ending of the series, when Nickelodeon ordered a second season.
rename it, Sumica
:O
yes, the sumi-rocket.. the one that can make powered flight to the outer rim
Woah
00,02dis works by the way
HOLY SHIT
00,02i got to minmus with it
Wiggle wiggle wiggle wings yeaaah!
Sumica: more like the tower of FAIL
my ear111111s
RAWRity: A second season has been green-lit for months....in fact IIRC it was greenlit from the start
sonicrainboomer259: you know nothing of this beast
07you've never done that? .-.
ascent rate looks slow
CriticKitten: eenope. It was originally going to be a 12-ep single series, and then a few months after that, it was announced Nick ordered a second season.
..or stagnant
it is slow at this stage.
ponibas: it wasnt initially
*Puts glasses on, too light, that's why.*
Sumica: now they all think you suck
But he is gaining speed. Slowly
RAWRity: Wikipedia's had it noted that there would be a second season since....months ago,
oh why hello Spindash
God forbid this blows up
most of those G's are probably in stabilization, Sumi
Good morning everypony
CriticKitten: and the season finale was likely already written well over a year ago.
CriticKitten: what show?
sonicpersonfrom florida.. I don't think he sucks
03no
two-thirds
03I'm not a camera expert
already lawl
03but since you're here
03got any suggestions on a new camera?
So did Sumi make a rocket out of several other, tinier rockets?
03The new CyberShots are totally aimed at little kids as there's like, no mode selection anymore :/
sumica, I can't hear you over the roar of the engine!
RAWRity: basically
ponibas: how do you know where i live?
lmao
03CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIMINEY CHIM CHIM CHEROO
03I mean, hi
volume already low as hell
/me slaps drf
ponibas: say nothin
i aint
That seemed super out of character
xD
much
ja
yes
03dude I'm bored
Sumica: yes
03and still in a weird mindset
hey all
03leave me alone :P
we need to hear the tunes better
nou
Better
07lol
07well
03so hm
from 4G to 40
03basically
\m/
03I want something that I can take pictures inside without a flash
03cuz like
03when I was at Hearst Castle
03they were all, no using flash
07I could care less about point and shoots
03all my pictures lburred :P
03-l
who's streaming?
03er *blurred
those solids do not burn long thogh.
Sumica is
Sumica is streaming
ponibas: i meant thye astronauts
sumica
03i didn't learn how to use manual mode until like 20 minutes ago .-.
well that lyric
07so go for most functions
ah. sweet
inb4 Ackbar
03LOL
RAWRity: It's been written since 2011's Comic Con?
03well
I was thinking, and Amon's backstory actually explains something from earlier.
07and then best optics
03did you see that $300 Nikon I found?
03er
03*Canon
03not Nikon
07yeah
0320x optical zoom on a P*&S
03is awesome
oh, well, he tortures the shit outta them anyway
wat RAWRity
03isn't it? XD
03my Sony has... 4
Rain,Rain go the FUCK away!!!
03no wait
033
if they aren't scared he makes them hit water
033x zoom, 4 megapixels
Because that was apparently when it was announced that there'd be 12 eps in season 1, and 14 in S2.
there we go. That should be enough for orbital height.
it still raining there sonicrainboomer259
07I actually have no idea what the multiplier translates to lol
00,02i have an awesome trick to show next time i stream ksp
Hello Everypony !
07DSLR lenses go by mm
hey Alister[S]
why the S?
CriticKitten: most likely, yes. It takes a LONG time to storyboard and plan everything, so the initial writing phase for the first season would have been a long while ago.
hmm
hello Alister[S]!
i wish it'd rain here. I hate the desert :/
ponibas: how do you know? :O
ponibas: That I can't tell you
not to mention actually animating it
lol, sumica, we have fins on very few of our vehicles
03I never understood how that worked
0335mm is "normal"?
ye
RAWRity: Not to mention there's a core problem with the writers assuming that Nick wouldn't ask for more. >_>
03I mean I get that 35mm film was actually 35mm
03but why use that for digital? LOL
Alister[S] y u no spill guts??
maybe 35/multiplier?
07because the sensor is still that size
Lol sumi
Phase4: when is that going to be?
but sumica IT'sS cool that way!
ponibas: It's a secret. Even if I'm the only who cares
go BOOM!
03wait what
00,02Kandarihu, you'll see
Alister[S] fair enough
03you mean the lens? or what
Eh, in .13, I used to land ON my fins, so I needed em
03as the lens on my camera is like the size of a pen-tip
03o.o
Success !
the [S] stands for Secretive!
03well, the part that actually opens and closes
no
00,02hen3ry, yeah, but .14 has the legs
RAWRity: It's THE show on Nickelodeon, why would they only have one season? Why would the writers even box themselves in like that? I really can't sympathize, and it's poorly paced as it is. >_>
ponibas: TELL ME DAMMIT!!!
success at?
0735 on a standard dslr sensor
Yeah, I know. Very useful now
03oh
00,02dis new design i'm working in is super stable
03I don't like DLSR
success at hiding secrets
03just because they're ginormous
or is that where the secret lies?
03point and shoots are fine if you're just taking casual pictures IMO
lol... aight
CriticKitten: ah, but what would be better, the writing team assuming they have 12 eps and making an insular story, or assuming they'd have more eps, not get them, and then end up having a single season with no real conclusion.
dem lyrics
Is he trying to get to mun?
/me glomps Hodiku
Well, I won't be able to watch very much within the next 15 hours or so.
sumica, going for escape trajectory?
03OK so
tanks look almost done
/me is glomped!
He's already passed mun orbit... probably minmus too.
03http://i.imgur.com/UNXu1.jpg <- this picture, I set the shutter time to very low, no flash, obviously dark
03can that be "corrected" in the computer?
07yes, but that 35mm means that on a 35mm zoom setting, it's basically like there's no lens there
at least as far as tragectory goes
oh he's escaping
minmus?
RAWRity: >Avatar >Nick cancel it
NOPE
good morning everypony!
hey Hodiku!:)
How goes it MahBoi777?
escape Kerbal
night all
07that's far too dark
CriticKitten: and it's THE show now, but considering the shit that A:TLA's third season went through from Nick during its airing, I can imagine the crew wasn't too trustworthy.
dats.. DEEP orbit
And trying to escape Celestia
Thankfully no one who knows me is here
you could
see you all in the morning
Hodiku: goin good, u?
but iit's be very noisy
07underexposed pictures where you can make out everything, but it just looks dark
00,02whats sumi doing?
07can be corrected by burning the image more
solar escape?
decently, have work at 6 am. :'(
nite Derpy|Asleep
03so there's really no good way to take indoor pictures with no flash without a tripod?
and escape fail.
/me has a goggy
Now to drift in space
07aside from placing it on something and holding steady, no
00,02dat speed
lost in space forever
07pocket tripods are pretty cheap though
03that's what I mean by tripod
03well
03if it's like, say, a walking tour of a museum
RAWRity: Problem is, they DIDN'T make a good story out of 12 episodes. It's too rushed, it has holes all throughout it, and the writing smacks of "we'll never explain how this works because we don't NEED to".
03good luck with that :P
CriticKitten: The last half of S3 was teased for months after the eclipse episodes. With the air dates being announced, then pushed back multiple times. Then, the final episodes were all aired in a single week, and then barely ever showed again.
Sumica: littering space with Kerbals since.. last month
um.. do you have rcs tanks left?
07some point and shoots with a cmos sensor can adjust the ISO
I'm surprised the Kerbals havent gone extinct yet
oh you do nevermind
03mine can do that
03but
03it's so fricking old that it maxes at ISO400 :P
03it does 80, 100, 200 or 400 LOL
just no ASAS
03also hm
07yeah, that's
07low
03what does "exposure" do in Photoshop
03like in technical terms xD
03but yeah that picture looks awful if I just raise that
the cockpit's SAS, at best, softens the tendency to go into superspin
RAWRity: If they had, maybe it'd be a different story. As is, Korra hardly establishes herself as worthy of the "Legend" title in this one. It's just not up to the same par as Legend of Aang, not by a long shot, and the writers HAD to know that.
try canterlock mode?
GAH! I can't watch the new RDPresents! :[ It keeps lagging it'sl ike bl....ah ah...bl...ha :|
07try the burn tool
guys i just ate a lego
Ponies47: did you stop the stream?
03uh
03where is that
07you're still not going to get much with an image that dark though
03I don't do photoshop much
owlicious[G]: Diesn't make a diffrence
*doesn't
Pinkies4thWall: with cheese I hope:|
bricks will be shat
07it's one of the expanded options on the standard toolbar
07but
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
07I can't be bothered to open up photoshop myself
07|D
Pinkies4thWall: What size lego was is?
dem kerbals
03XD
Look at dem go
and then Sumica made them spin helplessly
03inb4 pixlr
03now hm
03here's another thing I don't get, or maybe I'm overthinking this
Ponies47: full depth 8-stud
press ctrl-L
03if I have the flash on and it's just on auto mode
levels
adjust etc
03I can literally shake the thing with my hand
03and snap a photo
03and it's not blurry
Sumica: use canterlock for precision mode
sagas[A]: I'm back handsome rogue
Do a barrel roll
sumica, where you at on the map?
they might as well do something if they are going to be lost in space forever
Pinkies4thWall: O_O HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO EAT THAT!?!?! :o
03well, looking at the metadata, it says it was using "40" shutter-open-time and ISO400, right
03so I set it to those in manual mode
03and it blurs.
03Why
Spade-Magnes[R]: What is the R for 6
guys do i tell him
07anti-shake feature?
?
?*
07also
Alister[S]: Oh we're in the main chat now :)
Rebuilt
07at 1/40
sagas[A]: I didn't notice (act natural(
Ponies47: candy
03um
03this camera is old as frick
07that makes fast moving things pretty blurry
03there is no anti-shake feature
Look at it go
dat secrecy
/me acts natural with Alister[S]
03I've never seen anything faster than 1/40 in auto mode
03o.o
IDIOT !
03my camera supposedly does up to 1/100 though
use 1/100 or above plz
03or down to?
I guess I just don't get why they didn't at least ask for 20 eps like the regular Avatar seasons. There was so little development, they had to know that this series would strike gold by sheer virtue of following the footsteps of A:TLA. I just don't get what they were thinking.
sagas[A]: dafuq is it with all those letters are the end of your names
Pinkies4thWall: Candy legos? Hm never heard of em. :P
stop spinning and you can make it futher :3
Woo horror movie marathon

Ponies47: you thought it was an actual lego?
:O
....
03BlueFlare join the conversation
ESCAPE !
killerpony7733: that would take some xplaining
there is no escape from Celestia today
shorter shutter speeds = less blurry, bit dimmer
*but
03er wait
03I can do up to 1/1000
03or down
sagas[A]: i'm all up for explaining :D
02hurr
03what's a "good" amount to do
/me a wild sagas fled!
03even with a flash
sagas[A]: Ok go ahead tell them
Pinkies4thWall: It sounded that way. But there was this one time I did swallow a lego it was only a 1x1 stud :P
ok, perhaps I stand corrected...
07anything faster than 1/100 should eliminate most blur
killerpony7733: Well we're kinda together now :3
Epic!
Didn't think you had the RCS fuel left to do it, but... ok.
/me holds Alister[S] hand
Sumica is going to the stars!
/me blushes
Ponies47: so you actually did eventually shit bricks?
Woooooo
sagas[A]: uh ok
13000
Pinkies4thWall: I was young so IDK :p
03woah
Man I wasted so much time and money on legos :|
03doing 1/1000 with flash actually looks good xD
I once ate a nickel
lol, more kerbals will die tongiht because they collided with a spent booster
03but ISO80? Is that normal?
Sumica
03I have it in manual mode, but with "auto ISO"
its OK
lower ISO = lower noise but dimmer
yeah, that is escape
07lol
03mfw
sumica can i ask somthing
it's a balancing act of 3 parameters
it'll just take a LONG time.
03even with manual mode on 1/1000 it blurs like crazy when I shake it
ISO, shutter, and aperture
07front-facing flash...and looking 'good'
03APERTURE SCIENCE
02If I want good lighting but also want fast speeds, I set the aperture to 2.5-3.5
07that just amuses me
Pinkies4thWall: with cheese?
03Kyu I'm not a professional :P
where is dickshep
03uh
03isn't 2.5 really slo?
2...I just died as soon as I joined a server :|
03*slow
Hello
:[
022.5 is super fast
sumica is pulling a Han Solo.. just floating with the trash
072.5 on what
03wait what
02aperture
I like pinkie pie
03my camera does it in terms of 1/x
MahBoi777: sadly the nickel was before i realized what cheese meant to me.
DUR HERP
hello Sunburst
03like 40 is 1/40 seconds
03o.o
Hi
dat yay
072.5 aperture is really wide
ponibas
03also Kyu/ BlueFlare, what is "EV"?
07you get less depth of field
Pinkies4thWall: I understand
yeah, needs warp 1 million.
03like it goes from -2EV to +2EV
Sumica cheat engin
07might be manual light settings
THIS DAY IS GOING TO BE PERFECT THE KIND OF DAY OF WHICH I DREAMED SINCE I WAS SMALL
02true Kyu, but if it's really dark, that's better than a high ISO
lot of debris at where I assume Minmus and Mun are.
07yeah
MahBoi777: i has wensleydaletonight
ERRYPONII WILL GATHER ROUND
all scared shitless
MahBoi777: i has wensleydale tonight
inb4 kickage
C AI LUK <3 LY IN MY GOWN
03ah hm
<3LY
03it does seem to be a manual light adjustment
good thing Kerbs don't need to eat drink or breathe. Cause they're not getting back home
03but what *is* EV?
<3LY IN MY GOWN
oh no singing
03and don't say effort values or I smack you
dat allcap singing
sumica blow stuff up
dat autokick
WUT DEY DUNT NO IZ DAT AI HAV FULED DEM ALLL
think he;ll trigger autokick?
07exposure value
03hm.
02EV stands for exposure value
maybe
03ah THAT's aperture
im calling grammar police
if he sings fast enough
03the two cnoices I have
03*choices
Pinkies4thWall: Wensleydale?
ponibas: im hoping'
032.8 and 5.6
03o.
Stream?
03*o.o
MahBoi777: english. very tasty
Who here is on the east coast??????
00,10suppose I could continue a bit on dickshep
ASDFJKLL;
07lol
yay
03is bigger better or?
:);):P
dickshep?
035.6 seems to make it brighter but blurrier?
waaaaa?
03granted it's a tiny LCD :P
Sumica! you broke my stream!!
00,10or some one else can take over streaming soon if they want.
I'm in ET but not on the coast
can i?
075.6 would make it darker
dat kick
phase take over
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'MM back :)
03hm.
03When the zoom is set fully to the W side, you can select an aperture, F2.8 or F5.6.
03When the zoom is set fully to the T side, you can select an aperture, F5.2 or F10.
03You can select a shutter speed from 1/1000 to 30 seconds.
03The difference between the settings and proper exposure judged by the camera appears as an EV value
03(page 31) on the screen. 0EV indicates the value judged as the most suitable by the camera.
03from the manual
my hope was answered
03oh you know what else I don't get
03why does zoom make the picture blur easier
03o.o
03given the same settings
sumica i miss dickshep
so you can do youre ksp trick thing
07because that's just how optics work lol
03odd
03well
.. ow my arse
I have decided to down load Kerbal Space Program tommorow morning!!
03thankfully with these new over 9000 gigapixel cameras
03you can just not zoom
03and crop
03:{
03*:P
Sumica xD
/me runs
03nah but like, going from 4MP to like 12+
03is a huge leap
;map
lmao*
03someone was saying 35mm film is equivalent to 12-15MP, true or false
07more
02The lower the aperture the bigger the opening is thus the brighter the photo is.
00,02i'ma finish something quickly then if someone else hasnt taken over i'll show my trick
02The higher the aperture is the dimmer the photo is. High aperture also raises depth of field
07something like 30
trick?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY panda!
Happy birthday panda
02^
Happy Birthday panda!
03really?
00,10well lets see how out of date the game is
what is this trickery?
07yep
O_o
03well, before it starts getting noijsy, right?
03-j
Phase4 but i want dick shep
03technically you can scan at whatever resolution you want xD
Alright
panda: Happy Birthday!!!!!!!
its a trick for bunnehs not kids
07you don't scan film lol
03BlueFlare what do you mean by depth of fiweld
03*field
nobody's being responded to!!here's my chance........BOOOOOOBIES
lol my thing says .co.nz
03how do you turn film into digital the
03n
/me SUPAH PAWNCH!
Pawnch!
07well, you /can/
a trick for bunnehs? So... he's making more rockets out of other rockets?
panda: Its your Brithday?
07but that's not how pictures are printed
cute lil baby rockets?
Lol i hope he does that xD
Om on the east coast ^-^
he;s gonna duct tape 3 of those towers of doom together
03yeah but if you're talking megapixels
see if he can push the mun
03that involves scanning?
Any pony else here watched "Brave"?
panda: Oh I see, then no birthday wishes fo u!
03for some reason all mine are skewed to the left which means "too dark" xD
02the more depth of field you have, the less blurry out of focus objects are
03ah
goooood night,everpony!!!!
03?
00,10ok because it has been a long time.
02yep
dang nabbit.. TERA still patching
Om xD at 12am yes ^-^
:( I wish Brave was better
07when a negative is exposed onto photo paper, you can get a much larger picture out of a 35mm film camera than you can most DSLRs before they start to turn fuzzy
panda: I'll try to be in bed by then
Om :(
good night good night good NIGHT!!!:'(
03oh
03I remember back in the 90s
panda: :I kidding
02and if you want nothing to be blurry in the background, then you would use a number like f/11-f/25
03people printing life sized posters out of 640x480 photos
03it was funny :P
07they're 'equivalent,' but not really compared side by side
03also LOL Sony
03Selects the still image quality.
03Fine (FINE) Records with high quality (low compression).
03Standard (STD) Records with standard quality (high compression).
03Why would anybody use standard?
Om :)
03like seirously
03XD
03*seriously
07saves on space
03woah multi-burst mode, that's what my dad's DSLR does
03This camera is awesome... shame it's old :/
07at least back when memory was small
03it eats up a set of AA's like every 10 minutes
03and 4 megapixels is annoyingly small by today's standards
02I have a photography e-book I can give you if you want drf XD
I killed the chat :'(
chat derp ?
nvm
newp
just got really queit
queit
./.....
well, I was seeing if anyone here saw "Brave"
quiet
03You cannot use the following functions in the [Multi Burst] mode:
crap
03 Smart zoom
03 Flash
03Lame.
wrong channel
03my dad's DSLR will do flash burst mode, it's just slow obviously
07that
everybody quiet now :(
07sounds dumb
but since there wasn't a response and there is no stream, I might as well just go to bed
00,10sorry for delay had to patch
02also drf
03what, burst mode?
03it's nice when you want to take loads of pictures XD
02what's your price range?
00,10will set up shortly
03as low as possible
/me hides
07flash on multi...
what is this?
well, going to be?
03that $300 one I found is a bit on the expensive side, really
07wait, no
07I'm thinking of multiple exposure
11,01Hope there are no leaks.
Ninjazz: did you like the rarity vid?
Om hehe i knw you you are aweomse :)
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16830120525 <
[16:00] PowerShot SX150
$250
02so it's around $3900?
07but either way
02$300*
panda: Wat?
Pinkies4thWall there was a rarity vid???? O_o
03yeah BlueFlare
evenin Nittany
03well
07that means your flash doesn't charge fast enough
Om yu are awesome :)
03you know, where oyu hold down the shutter button and it takes pictures as quick sa possible?
03*as
11,01I was about to tell flutter_spin goodnight :<
07yeah
03even if it has to recharge the flash, so what
03mine just goes "LOL NO FLASH"
panda: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJT-WKb7dNU&feature=plcp
panda: Even though I dissagre, I'll say thank you
07recharging a small flash takes time
02my camera can do that and focus at the same time
07so if you did burst
07you'd have most of your pics with no flash
07and some with
Om but you are like the most awesome filly next to... um.... many others ^-^
/me waits for it to be midnight to be able to say Happy Birthday to panda
ponibas O_o
03my dad's will just fully recharge the flash
03so it takes a second or two between shots
03but still lets you be lazy :P
BUTT CLENCHING UUUURRR
panda: Not a filly >_>
03his camera is cool except that it's huge
03and you can't use the LCD
0,14XD
panda: am i amongst the many others?
night all
0,14dat butthurt
nope... not gonna do it
02too bad I'm not getting a new camera soon, I would just sell you mine XD
Om hehehe :)
03you have a point and shoot?
dat epic buthurt
02SLR
11,01Oooh, the infamous ME3.
butthurt*
02dSLR
02*
Sylandest yes
should i go to bed or watch this?
03didn't I just say I don't want DSLRs?
panda: yay!
03I need something that can fit in a pocket :P
havent seen mass effect in a while
gppdnight everyone
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: you and me both
I love the Tuchanka mission
03B & W ( ) Records the image in monochrome (black and white).
03Sepia ( ) Records the image in sepia (like an old photograph).
03yeah OK
03because I totally can't just do t.hat later in an image editor
lol, i was still seeing the capsule in KSP but i was heaing the audio from this
Sylandest ^-^
02fit it in a car!
/me runs
I always did hate the Mass Effect Series :P
guessing Sumica is playing
ded
lol dat grenade
Irish_Pony: I always hated lepercons!
03hm
11,02I think I'm hungry... O.O
03random question: do auto-focus illuminators help at all?
Om: :|
SuperBrony64 want some cookies?
11,02YEAH :D
Kalros is best Giant Worm
SuperBrony64: Im dyung for food ;_;
*dying
/me gives SuperBrony64 some cookies
Irish_Pony: :3
/me hooves Irish_Pony a cookie and noms on his own
I don't think I'm going to be able to stay awake long enough to see the infamous ending or Phase4's trick.
i'm bored....
SuperBrony64 those are my last ones, now them good ^-^
07those also eliminate red eye don't they?
02they can help
Nom*
SuperBrony64: DA COOKIEZ!!! *eats it like a savage*
03well
02my dSLR has one
00,02never let me pilot a real rocket
00,02NEVER
lawl
Phase4: :D
02most canons do
Phase4: Meanwhile in Russia....
03I know if you use red eye reduction mode, it makes the camera flash like 5 times instead of just once
/me goes to make a fresh batch of cookies
xD
00,02in all srsness, i blame the game
11,01Rockets are computer-piloted for the most part.
00,02it lacks many instrimuents you realy need
03any idea why? XD
00,02dat moment when you fail epic hard
11,01The game is in development, so they'll be added.
00,02but the rocket you built is soo powerfull you allmost end up in orbit anyway
/me turns on pokemon gold
whos Cipher? lol
02you're sure you don't want a dSLR? :P
03yes.
0,14me
Yeah, Wrek! Make it quick! XD
Saxy
oh
03I want something similar in size to what I have
sumica where are we?
is still Sumica Streaming?
03just... better
hi saxy :3
03higher resolution, better zoom, so on
03apparently mine has enough features as-is minus the lack of a higher ISO mode
oh Wrek is playing
Cipher: wednesday next week sound good?
0,14sure
well im heading to bed
then ded
night sagas
02http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sx130_is <-- have you looked at this camera yet? It's a point and shoot
02derp
07the multi-flash thing is to give eyes time to adjust to brighter light
How did you play this mission, Cure or no Cure
wait sumica was that a dick move?
:D
02has 12x zoom
aw
07since pupils are wider in darker places that would require a flash
sumica.. i sense some paragon in you
03so that's what makes red-eye?
sumica HUIHUIAWHUIWHUIWHUIAWIHUAWHUIWHUIWAHUI there has to br
be*
there are no dick moves.. there are only super troll dick moves
03that...looks really big for a point and shoot o.o
07red eye is the sudden light making it to the back of your eye and reflecting back
you're oozing something
:D
03ah
03I just hate blinding the people I'm taking pictures of
02>Canon
02they like making big cameras
o-O
02XD
03plus removing red-eye in photoshop isn't too hard
Is this the real life?
you? put something into orbit??
how about adding red-eye?
07well the 5 flash thing is to allow them time to adjust
07since each isn't as powerful as the final
PHYSICS!
Is this just fantasy?
03right
03it still blinds you though
03especially if you take more than one picture
03that, and it makes it take longer
07the more sudden a bright flash, the more it hurts
oh please don't type out Bohemian Rhapsody
.......... *sigh* i forgot what day it is -____-
03anyone here used Olympus cameras?
03what pissed me off about those
-____- *
03is the fact that even though the shutter speed was fine
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
03it would take like 10 entire seconds from the time you pressed the shuter button
03until it saves the pitcure
03*picture
03so meanwhile people are standing there like HURRY UP
HAX
Open your eyes, look up to the sky and see
02hurr, you should watch that product demo drf
03and if you want to take a few pictures, it takes FOREVER
07that just means it has a crap buffer lol
03my Sony is just like snap, snap, snap
I'm just a poor colt
Avoid giant laser easier said the done
03buffer? o.o
no shit
then*
07basically ram for a camera
03ah
XD
I get no sympothy
03also, what's a "raw" image, just like uncompressed?
star fox = YES!!!!
07completely uncompressed, yeah
03how's it different from PNG then?
because I'm easy come, easy go. Little high, little low
03I'd love cameras that use PNG xD
07much bigger
ded
03PNG is uncompressed...
data straight off the sensor
03at least in MS Paint
You failed the mission
:|
03well
Mass Effect 3 : Gears of war 4 with minor rpg elements
07it incoporates more data from the camera
03OK this may sound like a dumb question
RAW has more data than PNG iirc
03but if you leave the shutter open for a few seconds, you know how it takes a few seconds to "process" your shot?
03is that like, compacting the image or
03what'
No, you're thinking of Dead Space 3
03and if you save it as raw, does it not take as long?
Gears of War: Ratchet and Clank with minor Halo elements
ded
XD
ye
03so raw would save isnt\antly?
03*instantly
maybe
07raw would take up more of the buffer
Ratchet and Clank: video game with minor interactivity elements
Anywhere the wind blooooooooooooooooows
like a rogue
07you only ever shoot in raw if you expect a hell of a lot of post processing
03see this is foreign to me
03all cameras I've ever used have saved as JPG
03even my dad's fancy DSLR
HOLD IT! why is there a pokemon center in new bark town o_o'
03also BlueFlare, what product demo, I donj't see one
03-j
or want to have lots of control over the photo afterwards
07your dad's should shoot in raw
03well it might, he doesn't have it set as such
03he also has his set to 4x6
03and not 4:3
03which is so annoying
07...
07why
03why at which
074:6
03ah
03because he's stupid
/me runs
Isn't New Bark Town where you start in gold, silver, and crystal? If so, I'm pretty sure there's no Pokemon Center there
034:3 is pretty much the accepted ratio for digital picturesz, right?
03-z
03inb4 SHOOT STUFF IN 1080P
03but his are all in 4x6-ratio
You usually sleep at Ash's mom's house
but i see one....
that regenerates HP
gold: Screen cap?
gold: screen cap?
"ash" OBJECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sumica I think I saw Harrison Jones!!
This actually got a 10/10 on Game Informer :P
Inb4 secret but fun
Wait, when did the stream switch from Mass Errect to Transformers?
what's sceen cap?
03I can find out what model camera he has, it's a Nikon is all I know
11,01Game looks fun. Too bad EA ruined it for me.
07lol
gold: See the button on your computer that says "print screen"
gold: or the one that says "prt sc"? PRESS IT!
03woah what
I need to get this... Soon™
03that Canon you linked me to uses AA's BlueFlare?
Stop blaming EA only. Bioware stuck their heard up their own asses anyway
03I love those, because I hate rechargables
03they die on you and you're SOL
03whereas I can just walk into any store, buy some AAs and be good
Why are you a robot?
/me 11,01dusts Sumica
03as long as the camera doesn't eat them up quickly >_>
0,14;__;
pressed it
Random bit of trivia: The founders of Bioware were
doctors, as in "take 2 of these and call me in the morning"
07well yeah, in point and shoots lol
:D
03pretty much all P&S's now use proprietary rechargables :|
03there's only like 17 of them on newegg that don't anymore LOL
Someone else might have gotten it wrong = best quote ever
YAY! After some trail and error I got to watch the new RD presents and I liked it. :3
Sumica who is Cipher? I havent seen him/her before
0,14one day I'll play through the entire ME trilogy
11,01I though the new RD presents was weak.
hold it..... OBJECTION!! THAT POKEMON CENTER IS WHERE MY HOUSE SHOULD BE! >:O
Wanna know how Nyx and
I are finishing eachother's sentances?
Why does the game try to make you feel bad for YOUR choice ?
panda: saxy

Wait, there's a new
Rainbow Dash Presents? What is it this time?
God i love the vigil theme
Nittany_Discord: Ah

11,01Yeah. I wanted to play through the ME series for the longest time.
Nittany_Discord: Wait...EA + RD?!?!?!? Dah Fauq?!
Nittany_Discord: Cold or Warm Pizza?
Warning: Might cause cancer
killerpony7733: God love it almost not really too

Om to each to his own
Nittany_Discord: oh :D
/me dust Nittany_Discord
Rainbow Dash always EA's in style
Evening Bronystate. Its been while.
We at Torchhoof have gotten a real working portal to Equestria built. If whoever's streaming can say "Nyx is best pony!" in a fangirl voice, they will be able to test it with us.
The feal that I never played this game nor do I want to because I suck so much at video games :$
07haa.
11,01My rants are worthless now.

02don't talk bad about how I talk >:/
killerpony7733: More or less. My memory is shot these days. I can only seem to remember select things. Thought I might have been sick but Doc says I just have too much to keep in check. So he said not to stress everything and I should find myself more apt at remembering things.
/me runs
Shizuka: I would :P
Shizuka stay up another 45 minutes?
Shizuka: Mr. sandman glompin' ya'?

Shizuka: HEY! Where in the same time zone! But Idk if you should or not. I'm not I....zzzzzz
Sylandest: Sup bro /) and can't complain.
one does not simply glomp Shizuka
Iron_Edge: fair enough i guess you will continue with the requests sometime later when you have gotten a bit better?
Iron_Edge: (\ everythings going good, hehe. just chilling
02problem is, due to the bigger size of CMOS, most point and shoot cameras don't have CMOS
Spectrum_Rush aww :(
ponibas: Rain does :P
11,01Bed, go to Shizuka.
/me 00,02hugs Shizuka
03OK I'm confused
/me 11,01is bored
03isn't CMOS the little chip on motherboards that stores the date and time?
Nittany_Discord :)
/me glomps Shizuka
Isnt the rule you can't ship Shizuka with any else besides ViVi?
/me gives Nittany lemon pledge

03how does that relate to digital cameras o.o
/me dusts Nittany_Discord
07CMOS is a type of sensor used in cameras
LAWL
02it's not the same thing
0,14oh these are comedy gold

Nittany_Discord its simple ^-^ you have to guess my name and no looking at skype :)
MahBoi777: Now you won't ever do that nasty thing again :)
07but what it means for cameras is how sensitive the sensor will be to light
11,01What dod
11,01Oops
11,01What do I get if I win?
you're a genius Om
Nittany_Discord hm... what ever you want xD

07typically from 100 to 1600 in standard cameras
No pony shall see my face or know my real name. No pony.
Nittany_Discord im not what i can give you, but perhaps an art request? ^-^
07the higher the number, the more noise the picture will have
02ISO 50 or gtfo
03how come with film, the actual film determines the ISO
/me runs
03opposed to digital
panda: Give him candy
03I remember when 800 film first came out, people ewre like OMG BETTER FILM
03XD
07because that's how sensitive the film is to light
Ponies47 it wont go through the screen
11,01OK.
panda: dawwww :<
03so any film camera would be able to have any sensitivity? o,o
03*o.o
TERA finally done
07pretty much
Om: I have a million of em
07but you're stuck with it for a whole roll

03was a legit reusable camera with a flash
hey everypony
Nittany_Discord O_o my legal name? XD

MahBoi777: Its so graceful

killerpony7733: I didnt do the transfer thing. So as far as my PC new I never had ME2 uninstalled it. Needed the space. But When I played through ME3 verieng on your missions some die others dont and vice versa for other players. My mordin died in ME2 and ME3 on 2 he was cloing the doors to our escape and took one to the head.

FOR LUNA!!!
0,14dat Scottish accent
killerpony7733: But as for the krogan female. She survived throughout the entire game for me even at the very end when most other side characters died from things such as me being too brutish or too leniant. Meh..all in all it was a great game. The ME3 series was pretty good.
MahBoi777: At least I ate like a king :(
Nittany_Discord no, its my first name :)
Nittany_Discord: it is a first name
dat very heavy scottish accent

Mass Effect 3's ending is still better than Halo 2's ending
Cipher: can I join?
05i know 2 swedish bronies that one had changed his name to fluttershy and someone else that changed their middle name to brony
11,01That's all I know.
Lol Ninjazz
Wrek: o_o
Wrek: That's a bit extreme
Om im just trying to cure nitts boredom
Nittany_Discord you dont give up do you? :(
panda: Well go get it changed to his next guess
0,14well, as long as I have one kidney, I should be ok >.>
there was an ending to ME3?... all i remember is an explosion and then i whitedout and cant remember
Nittany_Discord: well...I mean in truth it was kind of a let down for someone of "Shepards " Stats. But I mean up until certain parts of the end were it started making huge plot holes to leave room for an ME4 obvious release. It was pretty legit.
Wrek: Epic
Wrek: thats really interesting bronies you found
Are we searching for Luna???
11,01It would be funny if ME4 was in development.
to the moooooooon
Om, thats a horrible idea ^-^
panda: And yet...
BACK! :P
Om yes?
11,01Maybe EA did ruin the ending forcing Bioware to leave it open for a sequel.
05trying to remember halo 2's ending
05oh right cliffhanger
panda: boryn?
Cipher: Saxy...does it hurt or anything? Like can you still do everything regularly and there are no like -1 kidney issues?
Ohai Wrek :P
panda: You gunna do it anyway
exactly
Halo 2 is still best Halo
Nittany_Discord: Theyre making another Gears of War :P
killerpony7733 hehehehe no
Nittany_Discord: That's kinda what killed it for me.
Om nope :)
05i enjoyed halo 1 more than halo 2
05then came the 360
05so i couldnt finish the trilogy
panda: Pleas :(
05oh well
at least ME3's ending wasn't like The Sopranos ending..
Never played Halo. I has PS3 ^_^ Well it's my brothers :s
Om no xD
/me cringes at thought
Wrek: well better get ready for Halo 4 :S
0,14well to my understanding, having one kidney means you can't drink as much alcohol
I love Halo
Shepard, I... THE END
Halo 2 had a bad ending since Microsoft was so greedy
/me hugs panda "PLEAAAAAAAAAAASE!?"
Om no!
03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-dont-ever-show-me-this-again.jpg
11,01What big companies aren't greedy?
Om: what are you doing to panda ?
Valve?
/me runs off crying
Nittany_Discord: valve
Valve kinda is greedy
0,14actually, Halo 2's ending was because Bungie ran out od time
Nittany_Discord: Leaving signs around like the very ending of ME3 with the ship and what not. It's just kinda a kick in the nads really.
11,01Valve is a tinge.
TF2 Keys.... just saying
0,14Halo 2 and 3 was supposed to be one game
^
^^^
Irish_Pony: I forget, so I figured it must have been something improtant
05valve are greedy in a sense
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: agreed
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, but you dont have to buy keys
05but not muc habove accepted greedy
Om: =_(\
00,02and Not buying them doesnt exactly ruin th egame
00,02the '
05and sicne they arent milking say half life
Irish_Pony im playing a guessing game with nitt and he has to guess my name, and om wants me to change my name to his next guess xD
0,14thing is, Bungie hit their deadline during development so they had to cut what became Halo 3 as their own game
Phase4: still the option of it is kinda greedy, and ppl now buy keys for stuff like strange items
05the yare on pretty good terms with atleast me
/me drinks a nice cold Dr. Pepper Cherry
Mmmm.. :)
the More put into a game the better :)
03http://chzvideogames.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/video-game-memes-i-think-i-did-this-part-wrong.png
05im really looking forward to bungies new IP. i hope it seeks back to their roots with fantastic story elements.
^
Sumica: I bucking love the Mantis <3 that was my best friend through the entire game. One pop in the old brain bucket.
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, but thats from the people who want to waste money on stuff like that
IP?
05and hopefulyl they wont preassure themselves with deadlines havign to cut and stuff
0,14same, the rumor is that it might be a Marathon reboot
00,02Darkts3|Drawing|MLG, and it goes into valve's coffers so they can work on hl2e3
Anyone pre-ordering Halo 4?
niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.
0,14me
Bungie's game is a MMO, and with the past of making halos its going to rock =D
00,02nope
Cipher: /)
0,14(\ TOY_PON3
TOY_PON3: I am
MahBoi777: /)
05i dont midn tf2's minitransactions. they arent too expensive. much goes under a buck even half a buck
05some goes higher but meh
0,14actually, legal documents from the partnership between Bungie and Activision are out
TOY_PON3: (\\
when that game comes out, I won't have a life till I finish it
11,01How long until Bungie becomes a CoD dev?
Nittany_Discord: When the sun burns out
Read a book! Read book! Read a mother (squee) Book! :p
11,01That's the fate of every Activision-owned publisher that doesn't get shut down.
0,14given that it's supposed to be a ten-year partnership, it might be likely
Ponies47: Book? What is a book?
0,14Bungie has a good track record though
^
Wrek: Is TF2 working for you? I keep getting server connection errors. And "Game not available" do you know of any maitenece that might be going on? Or am I experiencing technology at its trolliest?
Bungie ftw
TOY_PON3: IDK! :D
11,01Bioware had a good track record before joining EA.
activision ftw
Ponies47: They should boring ._.
Games ftw
activision...ha!
05well tf2 is up to something
Iron_Edge: might have somthing to do with the update they might be bringing monday
ded
05with the mystery items
Halo 4 is going to be a lore fest =D
Nittany_Discord: I agree with you on that fully.
Back showing my non-brony brother The Canterlot Wedding episode.. Let's just say he is now regreting he hated us bronies XD
05i definetly smell a new content patch
Wrek: people sayin meet the pyro monday
11,01Activision could ruin Bungie and turn them into a CoD dev.
TOY_PON3: I see.
activision to me means something most likely from ID
!!
05maybe they are fuckign about prepping the game before patch
Oh shiiit
11,01Don't underestimate publisher greed.
sumica ranting is fun
0,14eenope
there's a fire fly in my room!
lol just think.. in a year all this random crap will be worth a lot
Trade Fortress 2 everyone
ded
OMG yay
11,01Gaming is serious business Sumica.
gold: ...
sumica your not supposed to keep dieing
11,01Especially now when there are issues in the industry that have been there for years.
TF2 new updates...mother of god..
touche
11,01:p
/me dances
bug not g1 pony >_>
All the yays omg.
will..will there ever be a TF3?..
ya da da da da da! :P
05TOY_PON3: not anytime soon
TOY_PON3: Valve cant count to three silly
05with tf2 being so profitable
TOY_PON3: :O O MI GOD
^
Wrek: Maybe when I am dead
05releasing an ew title would seem like a bad move becasue it would move the majority of the players to tf3 instead.
TOY_PON3: Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
valve cant count to 3
^
/) Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
05henceforth drop the item sales
05BUT
Wait a tf3????
I haven't even played TF2 yet. I hate my computer so much :|
does anyone play tf2 on xbox 360 anymore or did it die out?
They can, Half Life 2 Episode 3
Pinkies4thWall: (\
if i even had a pc... typing this on ps3 and stream works fine :) you know what thats like, a box to type in a box...
Ponies47: Why cant you play? Compatability issues?
lol Sumica
11,01They would move everything to TF3.
05maybe after valve release left 4 half team portal 4 we may see a tf3
I'd have to get the orange box to play TF2. it doesn't work on my computer
11,01But I don't see why a TF3 is needed.
Wrek: O_o
Wrek: Maybe yes
hm..
Iron_Edge: My computer is 9 years old. Just about ready to die. Saving for a new one at the moment
Nittany_Discord: I just was asking you know curiousity
oh yeah Wrek i heard thats coming in 2040...onlu 28 more years
05Pinkies4thWall: what?
halo
alienware or asus ROG? :P
05getting the orange box to play tf2 soudns absurd
i dont want tf3, im happy learning how to play tf2 thank you very much
i heard Half life 2 episode 3 is going to be announced at December 21, 2012
05if it wont work f2p direct from steam
This one is only a year old and it's shit.. Well at least the charger.
05then orange box will do you no good
just buy TF2 on computer, you got mods and everything
Wrek: TF2 wont work properly on my laptop.
Ponies47: -lol well aside from age what is preventing you from downloading TF2?
i want to see a new Orange box 2
I had to get a new laptop charge + a new bettery.
05Pinkies4thWall: then its your laptops fault
battery*
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: With what games though? o.o
I have a stock Lenovo G550
05so it doesnt let you download it from steam?
Pinkies4thWall: What are you having crashing issues or something?
halo evry pony
anyone remember a company called Interplay?
Iron_Edge: Uh no I've downloaded it. My computer is so slow it can barley get the game going. :|
tf2 just overheats my laptops video card
HAI :)
/me R3's back to stream
four messages at the same time lol
TOY_PON3 half life 3, tf2, portal 3, left 4 dead 3 :p
halo Ponies47
JRP2234[Web]: what video card you have?
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That gave me a nerdgasm just thinking bout it
Ohai scottish-geeky :P
Discord :) hiya
05besides valve still gains money from cs sales and whatnot
Wrek: oh i've downloaded it from steam, it's just that my character is Always moving forward and the weapon swap buttons are broken
NVIDIA GeForce GT 540M with 2gb vram
05plus all the cuts from steam sales
Ponies47: -lol maybe try shutting down some useless process from your task manager. There are certain programs that will remain active even if there not actively being used. If these types of programs stay ipen long enough they will slow down your PC.
Wrek: and the tf2 store
JRP2234 get a new card? ^-^
05Pinkies4thWall: so its oyur laptop that is broken?
JRP2234[Web]: a GT 540?

helo Irish_Pony how are yee lad
JRP2234 youcan get new ones ya know
none of my keys are stuck right now, though
8 gb ram
05have you tried a separate keyboard and does the issues stay then?
Pinkies4thWall: Do you have a mouse with a wheel? You can swap weps with that. versus using the keyboard. Personally I find it more effective anyways.
Sumica: They know you better than you know yourself :P
hmm. i need to try that
inthis case i can not g

not really, I was under 100 by that point.
You just gave me an idea
/me Looks at his pony pictures
Although my reentry from Minmus tends to be somewhat harrowing anyway, I was trying a couple things to avoid that and they seemed to work
=D
....
there's just something about a freefall from 46,000 km high (and no terminal velocity issues until the last 60 km of that) that just lends itself to screaming like a Kerbal astronaut
It ain't gonna work guys. Remeber I took these *Holds out pillz*
/me snatches pillz and runs away
ponies47 hate to tell you this, man, but, I'm a pharmacist in training. and those, those are placebos.
Some one get Louis, Ponies47 has PEELZ!
Placebo... :'(
/me goes in depressed state
I already took em so I'm fine :)
/me Yawns
actually, fun fact, it's almost impossible to tell a placebo from the real thing, except by a thorough chemical analysis. Most studies that use them are double-blind, so the pills have to be similar enough to the real thing to fool doctors and nurses.
/me doesnt know what else makes Ponies47 snap
:)
I miss Placebo. Why did you have to get banned you basterd?! D:
Ok it's 4:00 AM sleepy time. Night night everypony :)

shut up sumica
Sumica yaay!
Why is there that random gateway in the middle of the base?
its not funny dudes
i just cant get the song BBBFF out of my head
My big brother best friend forever, like two peas in a pod we did everything together
he tought me how to flie a kite
Aaaaaaand im back again. Hai guize :3
BBBFF is probably the most HNNNNG-inducing song in FiM
I'm bored.
BBBFF was the first twilight song since... her part in At the gala?
Am I right?
Or am I mistaken.
Am I the only one who thinks that Microsoft was being a douchebag for selling their software than distributing it by punchcards?
i think so
XAX I think you are mistaking there....
/me hugs RainBowJack
MasterBoss43: My mind refuses to tell me another song sung by Twilight
i like the G4 intro cause G4 is way better then freakin G1 intro with the freakin crapy stinky sea ponies
nite evry pony
when Twilight sang the BBBFF Twilight was 20% cooler in my BOOK
>crappy sea ponies
The G1 intro isn't Seaponies.
XAX Ok, i will tell.
Oh you:
yes it was
Actually, the G4 intro is loosely based on the G1 intro. Even the composing sounds almost alike.
Hmmmmmm
xxMoopyxx: o god.
what
I admit, G1 isn't bad... but it went downhill when the supposed G2 arrived.
hey can they turn this into a movie?
G3.5
XAX She is in many songs, like winter wrap up and the night gala. Some other songs too.
right.
i think i like the rainbow dash gala song
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
But your right XAX, her first own song is BBBFF.
eeyup
MasterBoss43: What I was saying, is that BBBFF was her first song in quite a few episodes
http://i.imgur.com/eqBlM.jpg
yeah i know
XAX Then i'm sorry that i didn't see the Her first. B*tch be gone now.
God dang it the bird is chirping and the sun is almost about to rise up over here cause its like 5:36 in the morning

Anyways how've you been Lil_B?
im not trying to insult anyone im glad youre having a good time streaming
I was just watching the TGS podcast and they showed the trailer for Krater, from the creators of War of Roses. Has anyone played Krater? Is it good?
The Deus Ex sale expires Monday
DeusEx:HR for 6€ on Steam, if anybody would like to know
05FairysHuff: planning on buyign it tomorrow
TOY_PON32 was good, been swimming
Nice
Wrek: I'd like to play a demo before I buy myself.
0515 bucks
05for all 3 iirc
:O
Wrek: I already have Torchlight 2 pre-ordered months ago
6 billion pesos
which is about 5 emrican dollars
^6 billion peso Man never asked for this
lol
yes, lets throw a huge flashbang and stare at it
05soudns legit
00,02:<
6 billion peso man is a just a guy with a kitchen knife taped to his wrist ^_^
Yes quite
00,02allmost had it
00,02Wrek, all 3 AND the dlc
im always depressed and all people do is to tell me to shut the fuck up *thinks about suicide but then thinks of the ponies*
...
FairysHuff: xD
Phase4: it's crazy right?!
00,02TOY_PON32, its insane
00,02but they did it
00,02and thus i own dx:hr
flutterchu: Your not alone. I'm 32 and have been depressed since childhood, on meds for 12 years and finally got diagnosed with Aspergers last year. I now take one day at a time.
flutterchu: these guys take use their time to stream so some take offence to people complaining about the stream being boring
I wanna buy it so bad
dont take it too personaly flutterchu
>3<
00,02one sec i'ma try something
flutterchu: Just do what I do if theres something streaming I'm not interested in. Pause the stream.
okay lets just be a happy server think of the ponies
:)
nope
yep nope
exept twilight
Oops, stream lag... weird
truth of the matter flutterchu Wrek doesn't take too kindly to complainers. Well I don't think any mod does tbh ._.
/me hugs flutterchu
alexxm: i dont appreciate any happy things unless i earn them by slavory
And here's something completely different!
/me dances
I don't enjoy much of what is streamed as it's mostly TF2 and KPS or whatever it's called. Neither of which I have any interest in. But instead of complaining I just pause the stream and chat with people instead. Easier and much less drama. <--- hates drama
^
DeusEx however I enjoy. So thats staying on
vote for me and I'll stream Lotus III XD
05FairysHuff: yeah most weekday streams are games and art. those that tend to stream series havent been on too much.
I say stream cute fluffy kittens! :P
i usaully give most things at are streamed a chance
hey thrtr
05will bunnies suffice?
Wrek: I don't mind it I just wish there was more variation in the streams. Doesn't always have to be Tf2 yah know. So I appreciate the Deus Ex stream now
05[13:59] Johan Tegelsten (Wrek): claims of suicidal tendencies today so far: 3
Lil_B: Whats Lotus 3?
hey BrOnyxia hows your day been
00,02lol
00,02email about washing out soda cans
00,02aparently sugar attracts gnats
alexxm: just started and yours?
05hope the bunnies lightens the mood ^^
05need to draw more daaw
That beep sounds familiar.
good so far BrOnyxia
00,02you guys need to read these emails
Wrek: OH! You finished it? YAY! ^_^ *Instant desktop wallpaper* If thats ok?
00,02excelent writing
alexxm: :D
If there is something no very interested on stream I do one of three things. 1. Ignore stream and focus on chat. 2. Do something else like watch TV, play games, or surf the web. Or 3. Just get off completely then get on later. It works perfectly.
Sorry wall o text..
What I've learned from first DeusEx: Read every e-mail.
Shareware games are a security risk?
dear princess celestia i learned that i still want to be an emo
05everythign is a security risk nowadays
True
haha 0.4 secs
I buy games on a whim far too much. I blow so much money on them and then hardly play them. Dungeon Defenders being an example. Now I want to buy Krater? GET A GRIP FAIRYSHUFF! Self control >_<
O.o
Im poor so I hardly buy any games.
05FairysHuff: i do the same but with tf2 keys...
Wrek: heheh ^_^ Thankfully I stopped playing Tf2 before that stuff was implemented
Wrek: are you interested in some free crates?
05its one of the few games i play on a regular basis nowadays
hi people
FairysHuff wow, I buy like a miximum of 2 games per year, nopt including smoll peunuts like Binding of Isaac or Humble bundles
TOY_PON32: I am also poor which makes my on whim game purchasing that much worse. O_o
That sucks FairysHuff
05hi dutchbrony
Wrek: *smiles*laugs* oh fuck you
*Smack self hard* Self control dammit >_< You don't need Krater!
And kick. No? Ok
05aint the cheerful mood eh?
Yeah you are
hello everypony
05hi LochNessCheez
But like I was going to ask you Wrek are you interested in some free crates?
LochNessCheez: Holla
FairysHuff what is Krater anyway?
05TOY_PON32: ant series 30?
05any*
Wrek: I'll have to check
Wrek do you collect crates in TF2?
I'll let you know though
since I would LOVE to be an emo http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/7dc2aad571160dd2e3437989a994c74b/29095%20-%20artist%3Amihaaaa%20cuttershy%20emo%20emoshy%20fluttershy%20hi-rez.png
flutterchu: :o
I got like 5 or 6 crates. Damn..
05FairysHuff: and the character design is wonky as hell too
Lil_B: You can find it on steam
BrOnyxia: *grins*
Wrek: Yup. All wearing masks. Bet the development team thanked the gods for that design decision ^_^
FairysHuff I want a game centered in a old part of an Modern German Tow :/
still trying to get three refined metals to make a bonk boy mask for scout
http://e621.net/data/45/ef/45efeb12bf8117ae648cd016be4ff2a1.jpg?1303655787
I have one just two more to go
anyone noticed the TF2 update with the advanced MVP statistics?
Anyone elses stream keep lagging?
ayup
i used to buy items for tf2 too... its not a good thing to do i understood that
diddutz: Yea weird
Roughly every five seconds it buffers the stream for me.
same here
I usually buy few hats and weapons. Whatever is in sale
is on*
05i only buy mods for my strange items
tho i dont get how steam workshop works
^
05it varies
BrOnyxia: Fairys... it's all driven by fairys
05on tf2. faving and rating a mod or item jsut increases its chacnes to get in game
Still waiting for Dawnguard..
hey got new music, Wind Waker Soundtrack and the Metroid Prime and Fusion Soundtrack :D
hm cool
FairysHuff: lol
I love metroid fusion
Metroid Fusion is awesome.
metroid prime?
;o
i play that
00,02streams going down for a sec
Phase4: Oki doki
00,02allso
00,02DAT WAS AWESOME
No pony panic
This is awesome
BrOnyxia I bought the Metroid Triology, but I quit after the first half of the second game :/
Can't see stream cause im on mobile but im sure it's good
We need more games set in places other than the US. Like say Nepal.
Lil_B: i see.. i have played metroi prime hunters on DS ;o.. its kinda nice
Or poland
TOY_PON32: Yeh.
Oh, did I miss the end of the cutscene?
TOY_PON32: I like variation.
00,02theres an email here
00,02from nigeria
00,02:3
FairysHuff: That's cool
nigerian prince? seems legit
:D
Come to think of it I don't think I've ever seen a game set in Scotland O_o
WTF!
no, Nigeria doesn't exist
I dare not press that link.
I just did
Poor soul
police fail

oh bai
good guy jenson
lol

00,02i'm doing a good playthrough
00,02because i cant stand being a dick
00,02so as non-lethal as posible and free the hostages
Phase4: Of what game? Sorry cant see stream atm
your wish is her command ... he?
00,02dx:hr
I like that.
Oh ok
F**k it. I am a consumer whore. I'm buying krater special pack now. >_<
00,02Lil_B, i'm not sure
Someone hit me hard.
TOY_PON32 desus ex human revoultion
same, I can never get myself to be evil in games
No one hit FairysHuff plz
TOY_PON32: But... but I deserve it ~_~
FairysHuff I don't always buy games, but when i do, I take the Special Edition
/me taps FairysHuff
No you don't
Lil_B: Exactamundo
Lil_B: Depends on the special edition. If it's £60 then no... not a chance ^_^
00,02i like the options here
00,02"i like em" "i dont like em" "shut up and stop asking questions"
haha
FairysHuff yes, my Cut-off prize is 70€, my last 3 big games were Skywars Sword, ANOO 2070 and Port Royale 3 and oll these Special Editions were under 60€
so what one you going to do then
Phase4: I always say I like em. ^_^ Just because I would love to have them myself
I just realised I was wearing shades the entire time O.o
00,02FairysHuff, i've thought about it and am honestly not sure wether i'd want augs
I put my sun glasses at night
LochNessCheez: I wear presciption sunglasses all the time. Sensitive eyes. Even at night
I would never buy something like Skyrim or Diabolo 3 Special Edition for 199 or whatever
I wear. It's I wear Toy..
00,02'neural enhancments' sure, but lobbing of limbs? yeah, no
Phase4: I'm all for augs myself. So long as it was a complete body replacement like in Ghost in the Shell.
Lil_B: I would
00,02XD
yeah, well, next step after neural enhancements is neural hacking
I was watching some music videos and thought shades would be appropriate. forgot to take them off
Yeh thats one thing I would avoid getting. Be permanently in autistic mode ala GotS
05id rather wait for the nano augs
I was watching ponies and thought swag would be appropriate. Forgot to turn it off
00,02jensen's voice somewhat disturbs me
ikr
Wrek: That would be nice but the main reason I want full body replacement is to change gender.
Wrek: Dunno if nano tech would be advanced enough for that
Phase4: Why's that?
I think it might be a little too deep
Well just bought Krater... And I feel dirty and ashamed. ~_~ I'm a bad bad pony.
05FairysHuff: play the first deus ex ;3 its all about the nano augs
considering that they can do a lot of it today...
00,02TOY_PON32, it just sounds off
Wrek: I've played it 7 times ^_^
Phase4: D=
he just sounds so emontionless
Like a dead man..
Wrek: I have the original boxed version from release and the steam version
well, he did nearly die
05well he's trying to do a JC denton voice.
he pretty much did die
Woah
"war... war never changes..." ANyone remember the rest of that quote? ^_^
final fantasy XXVI?
You know they'll make one
So Xeli
I got Skyrim
inb4 thats the actual final fantasy 26 cover
^
:d
05men do somethin somethin
FairysHuff: allthou i use that quote i'm not really sure where if comes from ^^
00,02what is it, 2080?
00,02and they still use scsi adapters
052042 or something
00,02heck, we dont use them now
2080 and they're only up to Final Fantasy 26?
diddutz: It can be traced to two games. Fallout3 intro and Metal Gear 4
00,02XD
2042, same question? :D
I just don't remember the full quote.
05Phase4: did you follow the email on your comp and finish the secrent sniff down?
Google it
Bonjour Bronystate! :D
FairysHuff: could also suit the CoD singleplayer ...
00,02Wrek, ?
hi MadSurge
05you have a mail with a code to a colleagues office
00,02havent got to jensens apartment yet
05which leads to another
05adn another
00,02huh
00,02gona have to do that
I wouldn't know. I hate modern realistic shooters. No imagination or creativity.
why the pony on the left?
hey MadSurge hows your day been
Cause ponies love augs to
Well I would like to stay but I wanna get some rest so later guys
00,02what aug to buy

02Now go and kill people
02Make me proud :D
alexxm: woke up, took a shower and ate :D
Wrek: I'm more of a sci-fi shooter fan. If I'm going to shoot a gun I want it to be cool and interesting. Like the gun that shoots spiders in Unreal 2
Oh btw when did all the mods get their own OC desktop ponies?
02Now, I'll play some CS
02Since I want to get better at it .-.
all milonaires are superheros now

http://uk.gamespot.com/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/forum/snakes-war-has-changed-speech-translated-into-8-languages-49960001/
I'm guessing it started with Wrek.
FairysHuff: So you should like HL2 and Portal a lot?
FairysHuff: even Doom and Serious Sam have interesting guns :D
Wrek: Oh cool I just wanted to know that's all
diddutz: I have both and played both to death
Anyways bye
xD
Hey
00,10hmmm what is wrek?
05FairysHuff: you should try the game ABUSE. nive variation of weapons. unfair difficulty that is still fun and all
lol nah
tbh I dunno why I got the game
obvisuly evil guy is evil
Wrek: Can you link me?
cus' I'm not as interested in those sorts of games

05Sumica: you remember that right? :P
00,10oh abuse.
00,10yeah
Wrek: Oh, the Alien vs Predator game? :D
Whee
05MadSurge: its not an AvP game
Wrek: I know, but the protagonist looks like a Predator and the main enemies look like Aliens. It looked like a fun game
05its an awesomely fun game
05a little short
05extremly unforgiving
It requires a fairly strong temperment. Without one, it can get very frustrating.
morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
hey Sylandest i'm good how about you
just fine
Morning, Sylandest
alexxm: doing good, hehe, just hanging out for a little while before i head out for the day
Kandarihu: I made it through the Land of the Livid Dead, I think I can take Abuse :D
Wrek was abuse meant to be an aliens game but they couldn't get the rights
hwowdy, Ethereal!
Nice to see you all again
MadSurge: that's the spirit
05alexxm: henceforth its not an AvP game
good to see you too, Ethereal :)
:D
05time to nap
05bai
night, Wrek! :)
OTACON
bye Wrek
Nini, Wrek
Kandarihu: as long as they don't pull some I Wanna Be The Guy style bullshit... :D
Good nap Wrek! :D
It's Otacon! :3
on the screen you mean, Ethereal?
That game requires an epic temperament... or at least a healthy sense of humor.
Yes
05MadSurge: you pull atleast 2 of those
05they*
Anyone here use Last FM?
Wrek: two in the whole game? Not enough to piss me off :)
05no 2 that were forgivable
the labcoat guys arms move so unnaturaly
chats ded
ded
Kinda
I'm here
I'm trying to get the last mb of Krater to download from steam. Hence my silence
/me is dead
XD
Says download suspended.
go FairysHuff go!
oh noes
Only has 1mb left to go to
Does anyone here use last.fm?
well its raining where i am
alexxm: I love rain
FairysHuff: check your firewall or anything like that?
aw shucks, FairysHuff
it's going to be raining where I am
Sylandest: I'll just restart steam the verify files. That usually works.
alexxm: we could use some rain where I am. We've been without rain so long, we're under a burn watch
So I had a huge epiphany last night about my OC. I saw him dancing and playing a sousaphone in a dream...
JASF is cool though
FairysHuff: good luck! :)
I also got Assassin's Creed II
as 1 wasn't available
Sylandest whats a burn watch
/me will get it tomorrow
alexxm: basically, a warning implemented to ensure no one tries to set anything on fire, due to the grass and local grounds being so dry. one misplaced cigarette or match, and everything would burn
alexxm: It means they have to be careful of sudden fires.
Let's jump on all furniture, who cares! :D
thanks Sylandest and MadSurge
Sylandest: Australia? Apparently its common there
FairysHuff: nay, Kentucky! :D
Sylandest: Ah, just as dry I guess.
This guy sounds like Batman
oh hi phase stream
Sylandest: Though I though kentucky was more humid?
Remember kids , only you can set forestfires!
TrixieBaconMuffin: Forest fires can happen spontaneously as well if it gets too dry.
I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS. I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
Could sprinklers be used to moisten things?
so you never heard of smokey the bear ?
TrixieBaconMuffin: I have, I lol-ed :D
forest fires can start naturally *cough*australia*cough*
LochNessCheez: Exactly
Kandarihu: we dont have sprinklers for all the fields of crops out here, lol XD
00,02you guys noticed how jensens coloar rotates with his head
There are certain plants that have evolved to thrive after a forest fire they are that common.
Phase4: im just now realizing it, but yes, lol
00,02broken animation ftw!
Phase4 i never had that when i played
the dead trees feed the new ones ^^
LochNessCheez: Yup.
00,02i like how everyone is complaining that i let the guy get away
00,02and then i find $42 in a bin
it's not like winter wrap up where WE have to set the forest fire for the next generation of trees to grow
LochNessCheez: But there are certain plants I forget the name of in Australia that sit dormant in the earth until a forest fire. Afterwards they sprout like crazy
Phase4: yay, surprise benefits! :D
Hello Everyone.
Dat Phase4 stream.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER VOICE
Oh her. She's fun. :D

00,02realy strange
00,02woah

Dammit all. ~_~ I went down stairs to get another water bottle and my grandmother pushed yet ANOTHER £10 note into my hand. ~_~ She gave me £20 just a week ago.
Ninjazz: :D its called post-breakfast happiness. It overloads common spelling ability
He's breaking the fourth wall!
Good morning, everypony!! :)
FairysHuff: is that good or bad?
howdy, RaveBrony!

Hey, RaveBrony!
hey RaveBrony you sleep well
05she sensed you had bought krater
Ohai RaveBrony!
05which is tha actual word for crater in swedish

Sylandest: It's bad. They live on state pension they can't afford to keep giving me money. But she keeps insisting. SOmetimes I have to sneak the money BACK into her purse. ~_~
how delayed is the stream?
/me waves to Sylandest, LochNessCheez, Ninjazz, alexxm, and MadSurge :)
/me waves back
Usually around 5-10 seconds.

Hi all!

FairysHuff: ahh, i see. Its good of you to be so caring to do that
howdy, MegaMoonShine
Hey there, MegaMoonShine.
Hi MegaMoonShine :)
i'm good RaveBrony

hey MegaMoonShine hows your day been
Sylandest: I'm almost completely dependant on them because I can't hold down a job. And I hate myself for being such a burden. ~_~
XD
FairysHuff: I am sure you are not viewed as a burden. And there's a job out there for you somewhere, im sure :)
:D
I don't think that's how you play b-ball.
come on, Phase4!
It's been good alexxm
00,02this city has well dressed hobos
So does Athens
Sylandest: I have been in and out of employment over the past 12 years. Never holding a job for long. Finally tired of this I went to get some help. A psychologist diagnosed me with Aspergers Syndrome.
Sylandest: Now everything makes sense.
FairysHuff: oooh, i see. That does tend to complicate things :$
No doubt.
Sylandest: Yeh... ~_~
/me hugs FairysHuff
FairysHuff: you'll figure something out
you don't say
We shall see ^_^
i meant about the hobo
alot of shit ging down... in the sewer... ya don't say
Remind me to download the OST of this game.
Spectrum_Rush: And lul
I'm looking to do some charity work in wild animal care. Just need to find somewhere.
^ lol
Ninjazz as opposed to people
Yeh, I tend to get rather attached to them though ^_^ So if any were to pass on I would take it hard.
first day there , sing flutterwonder out loud ^^
Ninjazz: :S
:D
MegaMoonShine: Hmmm?
Sylandest: Hiya Sylly!
CrazyCherry1: howdy, cherry! :)
/me hugs CrazyCherry1 :)
00,02dat guy sounds like kermit
I always wanted a StBernard or a Husky. I like big cuddly dogs ^_^
I prefer cats
/me hugs Sylandest.
I have a dog :)
I used to have a dog
he died at an age of 18 years
human years that is
I have 3 insufferable dogs and 6 cute wittle puppies.
inb4 he offers you a red or blue pill
LochNessCheez: Thats a nice long life. But still must have been upsetting for you
Ninjazz how are the dogs insufferable
LochNessCheez: :'(
I used to have a chicken as a pet.
yeah
it was really sad
alexxm: They are... annoying to say the least.
ok Ninjazz
My dog is real crazy sometimes :D
rawr
I remember when i had hamsters when i was younger /)^3^(\
what does it do MegaMoonShin
what does it do MegaMoonShine
i had a hamster once his name was mickey
Since I live with my grandparents I can't have pets. Wouldn't be fair to my grandparents.
i has kitteh :3
alexxm: He likes to run around the place a lot
how did we get to talking about pets?
alexxm: He has seemingly infinite energy :D
magic
oh
Now my first pet was a love bird :)
Birds are silly :D
was it from the whole 'fires start themselves you know' thing?
RaveBrony: Speeking of birds there are some nice videos on youtube of pet Owls ^_^ They are so cute.
my cousins have a staffie thats pretty hyper if it wants to lick you it will climb onto you and just start licking like crazy on your face
:o
A pet owl!?
hey, twilights has one
RaveBrony: Yes! Seriously! Pet Owl.
RaveBrony: Totally tame and affectionate to
Now way!! I want one! :o
Just search youtube
if I search 'youtube' I will see pet owls?
dat voice acting
LochNessCheez: Yes
nowai
:D
Way
all I see is how to be gangster
/me throws big green ball at LochNessCheez
Theres one vid where a guy is feeding his pet owl by hand while it sits on his shoulder ^_^ So cute.
IT'S A TRAP
you mean a big bouncy green ball?
So will it be possible to upgrade absolutely everything by the endgame or not?
my cousins have a staffie thats pretty hyper if it wants to lick you it will climb onto you and just start licking like crazy on your face
so Phase4 how ya likin deus EX... wateva
Kandarihu: Deus Ex? ALmost everything. Some things aren't worth upgrading
00,02Spectrum_Rush, quite a lot
Alright
what happened to this guy
get that one to work yet Phase4
Phase4: Wait, this is that 'weekend deal' game??
00,02Spectrum_Rush, no :(
on steam
alexxm: That I would love ^_^
00,02RaveBrony, yup
aww
00,02its worth it
Oh cool :o
What about blur??
Blur is £14 on steam
Im not much on racing games, but the extra elements in it caught my interest
:P
It is good and I suck at racing games.
I can tell you live in britain FairysHuff
So, did I miss the trick on KSP?
LochNessCheez: Oh? ^_^ What gave it away? *Cough* £ *Cough*
FairysHuff last time i saw it a few months ago it was still a pup
alexxm: A loving affectionate pet for an overly effectionate pony like myself. ^_^ perfect match
neat
I would be quite happy leading a life like Fluttershys. Sadly that doesn't pay the bills or food ~_~
did fluttershy have any scenes where she eats food?
for some reason I can't remember any
LochNessCheez: I don't think so :D
LochNessCheez: Neither can I
I was too busy drooling over her ^_^
maybe she doesn't eat?
she feeds on kindness
>:D
Maybe love is her sustenance
^
Fluttershy is changeling?! :O
and on this day it was deduced that fluttershy is a changeling
Inane ghetto talk!
yup
lol
MegaMoonShine: Where did that come from?
probably the nicest one you'll meet
plot twist
10yawnrawr
Hmm.. I wonder if I should buy this game
FairysHuff: Where did what? :S
looks pretty cool
Season 3, episode 1: turns out they didn't wipe out all the changelings
Starflash: you definately should
MegaMoonShine: The changling thing. I don't get the referance
*reference?
Wait. The guy is a sorcerer or something?
FairysHuff: changelings feed on the love of others
FairysHuff the bad guys it the season 2 fianle
I'm pretty sure
FairysHuff: you know what a changeling is, right?
a canterlott wedding
dont tell me you havent seen that eoisode yet
canterlot*
They gain power by turning into someone you love and feeding off of your love for them
I have been saving the season 2 finale of MLP so haven't watched it. No spoilers please ^_^
oh
oops :P
:S
hehe Not a big deal ^_^
phew
sorry FairysHuff
alexxm: Tis not a big deal. I'm chill ^_^
lol
I am possibly the most relaxed pony you'll ever meet. So relaxed I may not even have a skeleton O_o
is that what they call it now
The only thing I tend to get upset about is when people start drama.
:D PIRATES
<-- Hates people who cause drama. very stressful
whoa, cortex command is coming to steam
/me drops drama bomb in chat
is it good LochNessCheez
very
whats it about
it's got a big modding community
it's a 2D physics based shooter
it's got fully destructible terrain
etc.
how much is it going for
well you can get it on non-steam
I will be glad when I can start my prescription painkillers again. 6 more days to go. ~_~ Paracetomol isn't strong enough.
FairysHuff: what you need them for?
does this count as advertising?
:/
Don't think so LochNessCheez
Pian never stops
Ever
how'D that happen?
*pain
it's quite expensive
$20
any idea why FairysHuff
mind crush him Phase4
CRUSH
00,02alexxm, i'm thinking about that
00,02think it might work
Dark_Horst: I was at University at the time and went into a deep depression as things weren't going well. So I stopped taking my meds suddenly in a fit of self harm. Since then I've been in pain.
Just one little mind crush, it'll barely hurt him
sounds nasty
CRUSH HIM
Don't know for sure if the pain is related to my suddenly stopping my meds 7 years ago but it started at the same time.
/me hugs FairysHuff
Is this Deus Ex and should I get it
alexxm: *Cuddles* ^_^
crush him
It's why I sleep so much. The pain makes me very drowsy.
00,02well that didnt work
Hat: Get the original Deus Ex first
I have it only at the training mission for the past 12 months lol
Hat: the whole trilogy is 75% off on Steam.
:O
Thanks
Well that worked :$
That was good timing
he nad
yay now he's angrier
*mad
And now we must use... STEALTH!
Yawnrawrs.
Phase4: Theres a way in from outside, up a ladder to the roof, into a vent
Phase4 kill everyone
00,02alexxm, NO :<
come on it'll be fun
00,02alexxm, i have no where near enough ammo
Love and tolerate
Is Invisible War worth getting
Hat: No
Thanks FairysHuff
Phase4 at least tranq them then
00,02alexxm, even less tranqs
Yeah just knock em out
Hat: It was terrible. Even the guy who made it hated it and publicly apologised for how bad it is
00,02FairysHuff, wheres this ladder?
Lol
Phase4: behind that mesh, i believe
So just skip the bundle and grab DX1, DXHR, and all HR's DLC?
Phase4: gotta stack grabage containers
Round the side of the police station. I forget exactly where. Been months since I played Phase4
Hat invisible war is pretty meh. On sale on steam right now though
a) invisible war wasnt bad
b) it was made by a team
00,02Spectrum_Rush, yeah, the preoder one
00,02Chrysalis, its engine re-loads itself just to load a level
neat
00,02only played ~15 minutes, it looked meh, but still
so whats the worst game you've played
Okay. That idea of mine will save you $0.04
wow... the stream is WAY behind
half a minute, at leat
MORNING everypony
Phase4: Not sure but think the ladder maybe on the otherside of that fence.
That's what I was thinking Kandarihu, Invisible War may as well be worth getting for 4c
MORNING Bronysith
Here comes the fun
awww
hey Bronysith you sleep well
morning Bronysith
worst game? World at War probbaly
NOO
if you dont count nazi zombies
MW3 is worst
yes, it is on the other side of the fence
Invisible War is worth 4c
mw3 isnt a game
its a wallet
or a cow
It's TOTALLY worth 4c
are we talking about the horrible CoD franchise?
:D
one or the other, its not a game
perhaps
i got there by stacking the gabrage containers in front of it
Okay. I shouldn't be complaining about games that I haven't played.
Even though i play CoD i regret why i didnt choose bf
Call of duty is good for the economy. terrible for players
wow
I bought Invisible War on launch. Was extremely dissapointed
Heroes & Generals is where it's at
this might work
BronyForLife: that's why i choose to avoid CoD on principle after the first MW B)
is Wrek streaming?
00,02gota take down stream for a sec
I dunno why I never thought of that.
well i did choose CoD
nope
cus it was the only 'known' war game
Phase4: is streaming
/me glomps Phase4
Phase4: did I miss your KSP trick?
now watching bf3 clips..
BronyForLife: known? what'S that mean?
well
uhh
if we talk about FPS games
everyone knows CoD right?
Who doesn't, BronyForLife
TF2 is best online shooter
yeah
^
BronyForLife: you have no idea how many people played bf, do you?
TF2 is best hat game
well
i WANT to buy bf
Phase4: The way your heading now across the electricity only leads to gang land. Not the station
but the possiblities..
00,02Kandarihu, havent shown it
00,02FairysHuff, well shit
Okay. Thanks.
No I am not.
BronyForLife: even today the battlefield 2 and 2142 servers are filled
I have no respect for BF3
13Yes you are, don't deny it :3
Phase4: And they gang is instantly hostile ^_^
00,02FairysHuff, double shit
heheh ^_^
I honestly thought you'd answer my question while my flash was crashing. Thanks for your patience.
don't think i can trade all the CoD games for a one percent discount on bf2:BC?
BronyForLife: believe me, going with CoD over BF was a mistake. i know about it, i have both
Phase4: There deffinately is a ladder round the side of the police station upto the roof where you can entire via a vent. But I don't remember exactly where. Though I think it's over the fence on the left when facing the station.
Disreguard CoD and BF play TF2
I am
sleepy
i do
so I'm going to bed
bad company is not part of the bf2 line
best FPS and it keeps improving
bf3 is bf2's successor
though premium veterans are being such a douchebags
you mean that new 10 bucks weapons unlock thing?
Is Livestream not free anymore?
uh 10 bucks weapons unlock thing?
BronyForLife: yea. thats why bf3 is terrible
Has anyone played Heroes & Generals
oh i see
BronyForLife: there'S something called bf3 premium. pay 10, get all weapons unlocked. though, it seems pretty useless
well look at it this way
Dark_Horst: it is to cater to newbs
who pays for that doesnt have a life and actually spends money to get a higher rank
Bronysith: it doesnt ake the game bad
i only spend money buying the game
Dark_Horst: it is to cater to newbs and people who dont want to work for anything
not to be a 'pro'
Guys it's a game. Far more important things in life.... like MLP ^_^
Bronysith: so? how does that influence YOUR gameplay?
The core of BF3 is no good anyway, let alone extras
Dark_Horst: it doesnt. I PLAY TF2 FTW
oh... you're that blockhead
Spongebob in a nutshell?
And suddenly silence.
Indeed
Well, bye dudes!
bye
bye MegaMoonShine
00,02i think dats enough dx:hr for tonight
Hello everypony :)
Phase4: Awwwww ~_~

Hey alexxm, how are you?

Hello Randomnerd

Ohai alexxm. Fine thank you :)

I'm gay.
CELESTIA!
two of them appear happy to be going to the sun
how fast ARE you going?
holy crap
/me arm flail, waving at Celestia
to the sun
omg
:( CELESTIAAAA
00,02well
00,02i'm in the sun
So... what's happening?
looks like rainbow dash has a lot to live up to if he wants to be the fastest pony
o3o
00,02no clue what Sumica was talking about
Phase4: BULLSHIT!
BLOW IT ALL UP!
And you're not dead? HOW ;D
you are going FAST
LochNessCheez: rainbow dash is a girl
it's the only sane solution
damn you, non-collidable objects
Bronysith: LOL :D
did I write he?
LochNessCheez: Yes
LochNessCheez: yes yes you did
I did
-.-
She*
:D
LochNessCheez: Silly filly. :D
:P
derp
are the astronaught's cooked yet?
arlgith, switch to cam, this i wanna see
00,02whered my spacecraft go
oAo
it burned
you are going quite fast there phase
Celestia Killed it.
look at the speed
00,02huh
it ded
aaaaaaand it'S gone
KIA
look at the ffrigging SPEED
00,02i think the sun is secretly a black hole
Phase4: You did try and fly into the SUN! :D
Dark_Horst: :D
no it's just got a really high gravity
Guys, I'm gay, I love men a lot.
why did they die
two of them were very happy to fly to the sun
Phase4: Seems they got a little HOT headed :D
00,02XD
Teddy2456: That's nice. :)
Phase4: you're going at like, the speed of light x 5
00,02it says 'crashed into the sun'
Phase4: Well when it explodes, maybe it'll be one if the Solar System isn't sucked into the center.
Phase4: How is that scientifically possible.
00,02LochNessCheez, no, 183737 M/s
so technically you can land on it?
brb
meh
otherwise how can you "crash"
00,02little more than half the speed of light
half the speed of light
try FULL speed of light now
lo
00,02Custard, its kerbal
lol
00,02science doesnt apply here
Phase4: They should had brought marshmellows :P
Phase4 is the tardis saved
or some sun tan lotion
00,02nope
00,02it crashed into the sun
try to go the speed of light
00,02which i though was imposible
rainbow dash is making my game boy emulator lag :(
00,02but aparently not
00,02LochNessCheez, that would take too long
That's a lot of crashing into the sun going on there. :S
so you CAN land on it?
so you have to bulid it again Phase4
00,02i'm sure the game allows it
/me Hugs gold
youtube it
00,02alexxm, oh, you meen saved to a file
see if it's possible
00,02its saved
yeah Phase4
00,02this flight exploded
00,02we went to see luna
00,02survived
so, you saved luna
00,02went to see celestia
and now you killed her
00,02she killed us
00,02:<
wait
Phase4: She shouldve just sent you to the moon
00,02LochNessCheez, no, we left her on kerbin
celestia killed luna
:O
oh
celestiais a harsh mistress
we did?
00,02yeha
00,02desktop pony != luna
and appearantly doesnt like getting poked by small blue boxes
WELL IT SUCKS TO BE HER THEN :D
Luna is pretty pony +w+
I would have thought luna would want to go see her sister
00,02LochNessCheez, considering we exploded
00,02i'm fine with her staying on kerbin
kk
LochNessCheez: Yeah, but her sister might kill her. Luna is small and blue... All she needs now is to be a box.
00,02i cant wait until season 3 :3
^
Phase4: Ditto
I hope luna gets more episodes
But I think it's coming out in like september
and I hope some of the background ponies do too
it is custard
LochNessCheez: She deserves more episodes
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ;A;
00,02currently wiki says its in production
00,02and nothing more
00,02:(
WHY CELESTIA WHY
:'(
I think Lauren Faust said it's coming in september or something
MAX MYSTERY ABOUT THE SEASON
LochNessCheez: That means it's either GONNA BE BIG or THEY HAVE NO IDEA ON WHAT EPISODES TO MAKE
00,02and nothing on the mlp:fim wiki
00,02well its bed time for me
I think it's on Lauren Faust's thingy page
LochNessCheez: Thingy page?
Mmk
Aww goodnight Phase4!
Lol
fyre-flye
Night Phase4.
Derp
goodnight
LochNessCheeze: I know I've seen it
the most accurate info is on the studio's page and it says about 13 episodes in production
night LochNessCheez
I was talking to phase4
CCCP: o3o''
Custard: :3
:L
Helooooooooo everypony!!!! :3 <3

Hello BroKnee :)
Hi BroKnee!
Herro
How are you all? :3
hi BroKnee
Tired
very well
Nabronyan I know how ye feel xD
I woke up like
Has anypony tried private chatting themselves? It's fun :)
So whassup y'all? I found a really rare Kid Icarus card :D
30 minutes ago
hi MadSurge
speaking of cards
is there an MLP card game?
Hi BroKnee :P
CCCP I was here before you. :P
Harroh Ponies47 :)
i know
LochNessCheez: if only
I heard that there is going to be an MLP Trading card game
lol
BroKnee: YAY! :)
Nabronyan: Yay~
I don't really like card games
I want an MLP Board game.
LochNessCheez: card games on MOTORCYCLES!
LochNessCheez: But it's the PONIES.
12!pokemon
Bronysith: RIDING ON CARS
Soital, you are a Exploud.
Nabronyan: /)
12BOOM
:/
Nabronyan: um. thats egoraptor
Custard: (\
ponies don't have motorcycles
LochNessCheez: But they could ride them if they wanted to :D
If I was a pony
I'd sit in the corner all day, wondering how in god's name how I can pick things up without apposable thumbs
you're saying they would disregard the environment by polluting it so that the pegasi have a harder job?
BRB
Ponies47: K
I would prefer to be a unicorn rather than a pegasus
http://derpy.me/FM0iM
LochNessCheez: Same because you can use your magic to make you fly. Have you seen Baby Cakes? :)
ayup
all the episodes
Back. :)
LochNessCheez: My point exactly
in fact, I had an MLP marathon where I watched all 52 episodes
Welcome back Ponies47
non-stop
except for sleep of course
LochNessCheez: :O
LochNessCheez: How long did it took?
Thnak you Custard :)
I have all the MLP episodes recorded on my tv :D
You're welcome Ponies47 :)
I HAVE ALL THE MLP EPISODES ON NETFLIX
well 52x22 = 1144 minutes
Custard: nice! :D
you can work out the rest
Nabronyan: I can check to see if I do, I have Netflix on my Wii and PS3.
MadSurge: Thank you very much :)
that's like, 19 hours?
I wonder how many seasons MLP will go up to
as long as bronies exist
1144 Divided by 60 would be... 19 hours...
And a couple side minutes.
yup
Wow, a whole day of ponies :D
I bet that eventually bronies will be hired into the MLP crew
MadSurge: Heaven on earth
Probably
/me streches
and they will be able to do ANYTHINg
10Moo
There are some pretty darn talented bronies
10!pokemon
Skylands, you are a 4Munchlax.
LochNessCheez: I need to ask them for a job :D
including giving Octavia more scenes
10Nope
10!pokescram
Scrambled word is "iicjrha". To guess at what the word is type !pokeguess (Your guess here). Type !pokehint, !pokehint2 or !pokehint3 for a hint.
10!pokeguess jirachi
That's correct! Great job Skylands! You now have 4160 Points.
and giving Vinyl scratch red eyes
10!digimon
Skylands, you are a Beetlemon.
morning everyone
:O
Hello Derpy_Hooves :)
you didn't say everypony
Morning Derpy_Hooves
:O
:(
I don't care much for Vinyl Scratch's eye color
YOU DIDN'T SAY EVERYPONY
I want them to come up with some excuse
like, his eye colour changes every year
His?
Dafuq?
LochNessCheez: You and that gender confusion. :D
ikr
aefswdqwfxax
I keep saying he instead of she
I wish I could beat KOTOR :c
I agree with more Octavia :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puvstNGKSRI&feature=related
Kawaii.
I WANT MORE DOCTOR WHOOVES
/me Wants more crazy Twilight in seasons 3
*season 3
the background ponies need episodes centered around them
for example Lyra
she's got a voice actor
Bon Bon does to
ya
LochNessCheez: She has a very nice VA too. I really like her voice. :)
ikr
I like Bon-Bon's one from the Flutterage episode as well. :)
LochNessCheez: They should make a commercial with Lyra sitting
Colgate/Minuette needs an episode too
umm has sergio_scriptor been on today?
nope
IDK :p

I like them all equaly
sea ponies song>this day aria
i like fan songs
they do need to make a sea pony episode dont they
my fav pony songs are Smile Smiles SMile, winter wrap up, at the gala, find a pet, art of the dress

Ok bye :|
Welcome to the HERD
I'm new here too actually
Check this out : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazOk2DrO8Y i so argee with the comments , this should be Chrysalis'song!
chrysallis is the worst vvillain
I officially became a brony when I watched all 52 episodes without any breaks in between other than sleep and school
oh ya same here
ive been a brony since...like later winter
i actually watched winter wrap up on the first day of spring
lol
ive been a brony for about that long too
again. i dislike this day aria so much
first MLP thing I saw was the original movie
it is not sung by any of the mane cast
which was the worst thing I have ever seen
Chrysalis at least is still out there , Discord is a stone and NMM exploded!
discord didnt rely on an army
IC what you did there brony
it's not sung by any of the MANE cast
TrixieBaconMuffin don't forget theys still a prtal to hell out there
discord wanted to rule equestria because he wants nothing but chaos
LochNessCheez: yes. mane six
BBBFF and Love is in bloom are the only good songs from the season 2 finale
to my opinion
02Yooooooooooooooo
02I just watched the season finale of the Legend of Korra
02Mind Fng Blown
well l8r
bye
this day aria is just so...ugh
bye bloodybrony
Same
:P
Watched it yesterday
so what now
just, i dont like it
it's raining again
the singers sound like they are whining and it isnt sung by any of the mane six
02After minute 27 I was like saying "Noooooooo waaaaayyy"
and to me. only disney gets villain songs right
Same xD
It was silly :p
hell fire is the best villian song in my opnion
this day aria is a disney style villain song though
but it is just so done bad
and, in my opinion it's pretty good
i dont like it
your opinion
i know
i also dont like skyrim
I don't really like it that much either tbh
THANK YOU
i hate skyrim so much
combat system = crap
but everyone is all. "omg it is the best game ever
and the community
good god i hate the community
it has spread to NON gamers
we all hate the comunity we are geeks for celestias sake
wb bloodybrony
also
it is incredibly buggy, the combat is terrible. horrible and short story
that i must agree on
and of course. the stupid memes that it produced
and the movement animations are awfull
idle chat sounds lik a bunch of robots
Sith going on a full page rant?
yep
Ninjazz|Observant: yep!
also
Woo~ Keep it up, mah man!
NON gamers have started to use the stupid meme
a guy at the school i used to go to
who picked on nerds
and made fun of gamers
got pissed off at a girl
and he went "FUS RO DAH"
ha pathetic
i facehoofed
as would i
i mean
that guys an idiot
why. WHY!? yes. i dislike hypocrites so much
Ello there everypony.
ello Malavolent
well nothing going on mutch here so i better go watch some repeats :P
hey Malavolent hows your day been
alexxm: Great, had BBQ and met with few new people. :) How about you?
brb
i'm good Malavolent gave a friend of mine whos a brony the address of this site
Because we need more addicts :D
yes
very good alexxm have some sugary goods
he should be here soon
skyrim is the worst game to come out in 2011 along with MW3 and BF3
Hey there, Malavolent! :)
Suddenly, Ninja(zz).
http://www.splitreason.com/product/theescapist/1225
Bronysith: I'm sure they're not that bad. But more or less not deserving of all the hype they got. I actually enjoy BF3.
Ninjazz|Observant: CoD is the same game every year and BF3 includes the ultimate shortcut option. it is one of the reasons i have lost faith in gaming
Bronysith: Agreed upon MW but what's so bad about the shortcut option in BF? I'd like to see it as a way for players who don't have as much time as hard core gamers to get on a equal playing field.
Ninjazz|Observant: but there is no earning the weapons. i hate it when stuff is just handed to people
Bronysith whats the ultimate shortcut
alexxm: pay 10$ and you unlock everything in bf3 multiplayer
thanks Bronysith
Ninjazz|Observant: like i said earlier. if you are not a true gamer. stay away from games
Ninjazz|Observant: if you dont have time to play it. dont play it
Bronysith: Oh that is not fair. Just because someone has to budget their time for like... a job or something doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to play their games.
Bronysith: Anyone paying for virtual stuff in games (especially if you can unlock it through normal play) only deserves my pity
I blame EA really.
Ninjazz|Observant: thats what i was trying to get to. EA is ruining games
Err... Dice maybe.
True, Sith.
Very true.
I'm waiting for an independent game studie, that will make an original and creative title.
studio*
VALVE is one of the only good gaming companies left
they dont make sequels every single fucking year
And one of the only trust worthy ones.
back
but they cant count to 3. whatever i dont care. i only want quality. NOT QUANTITY
trustworthy ninjazz?
REALLY?
Yes.
WOW this is typical british weather here
What? Don't trust Gabe? Even after all the good things he's done? Just because he hasn't released HL3 doesn't mean that he is the utter troll that the internet likes to make him out to be.
5 minutes ago it was pretty much a shower of rain
and now it's sunny outside
/me showers
Yay~
...
Ninjazz|Observant: every single game that valve releases is awesome. i have NEVER been disapointed like AT ALL
Gabe is a brony.
/me looks out the window "awww" :<
He has to be good and nice, right?
Bronysith: Vavle's trademark quality.
98% of all pings from here are either "chocolate rain" or someone talking about the weather
i had good times playing left 4 dead 2
the other 2% are when I come in and hug one of my friends
I swear there's like, a quintouple rainbow outside but it's hidden behind houses
alexxm: ive had wonderful times with l4d2 and portal portal 2 and counter strike
Considering how much people love rain, I'm not too surprised.
rain's cool
alexxm: and tf2
aren't you rain?
Bronysith might be getting portal 2 to play with my dad
alexxm: thats fun
no, I am just named Rain.
/me tackle glomps Rain
yes, but are you cool?
but I do ever so love the falling water from the sky~

don't feed the changelings
^
I just ninja'd ninjazz
I thought the pony term for troll was parasprite

some dont deserve the pony term
but changelings feed from our love
Hope there will be a my little pony friendship is magic episode!
We might have a newbie here...
