Add more engines
11,01Rain: Good theory.

I like Sumi's background.

Duct tape not invented on a planet? IMPOSSIBRU
Rain IMPOSSIBRU! Quickly, I must get to that planet with 35 rolls of Duct Tape to make a Duct Tape Making Machine!
Breaking physics, one click at a time

07well
03so hm
from 4G to 40
03basically
\m/
03cuz like
03when I was at Hearst Castle
07I could care less about point and shoots
03all my pictures lburred :P
03-l
who's streaming?
03er *blurred
those solids do not burn long thogh.
03i didn't learn how to use manual mode until like 20 minutes ago .-.
well that lyric
07so go for most functions
03LOL
03well
I was thinking, and Amon's backstory actually explains something from earlier.
07and then best optics
03did you see that $300 Nikon I found?
03er
03*Canon
03not Nikon
07yeah

033x zoom, 4 megapixels
Because that was apparently when it was announced that there'd be 12 eps in season 1, and 14 in S2.
00,02i have an awesome trick to show next time i stream ksp
Hello Everypony !
07DSLR lenses go by mm
hmm
not to mention actually animating it
03I never understood how that worked
0335mm is "normal"?
ye
03I mean I get that 35mm film was actually 35mm
maybe 35/multiplier?
07because the sensor is still that size
go BOOM!
00,02Kandarihu, you'll see
03as the lens on my camera is like the size of a pen-tip
03o.o
Success !
the [S] stands for Secretive!
03well, the part that actually opens and closes
no
00,02hen3ry, yeah, but .14 has the legs
success at?
0735 on a standard dslr sensor
Yeah, I know. Very useful now
03oh
03I don't like DLSR
success at hiding secrets
03just because they're ginormous
03point and shoots are fine if you're just taking casual pictures IMO
lol... aight
dem lyrics
Is he trying to get to mun?
/me is glomped!
He's already passed mun orbit... probably minmus too.
03can that be "corrected" in the computer?
07yes, but that 35mm means that on a 35mm zoom setting, it's basically like there's no lens there
at least as far as tragectory goes
oh he's escaping
minmus?
hey Hodiku!:)
night all
And trying to escape Celestia
you could
but iit's be very noisy
07can be corrected by burning the image more
decently, have work at 6 am. :'(
and escape fail.
/me has a goggy
07aside from placing it on something and holding steady, no
00,02dat speed
07pocket tripods are pretty cheap though
03well
03if it's like, say, a walking tour of a museum
not necessarily?
03good luck with that :P
um.. do you have rcs tanks left?
07some point and shoots with a cmos sensor can adjust the ISO
I'm surprised the Kerbals havent gone extinct yet
03mine can do that
03but
03it does 80, 100, 200 or 400 LOL
just no ASAS
03also hm
07yeah, that's
07low
03what does "exposure" do in Photoshop
03like in technical terms xD
03but yeah that picture looks awful if I just raise that
try canterlock mode?
07try the burn tool
guys i just ate a lego
03uh
03where is that
03I don't do photoshop much
*doesn't
07it's one of the expanded options on the standard toolbar
07but
crap.. ijust missed a whole episode of Rosari+Vampire
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
07I can't be bothered to open up photoshop myself
07|D
dem kerbals
03XD
Look at dem go
03inb4 pixlr
03now hm
03here's another thing I don't get, or maybe I'm overthinking this
press ctrl-L
levels
adjust etc
03I can literally shake the thing with my hand
03and snap a photo
03and it's not blurry
03well, looking at the metadata, it says it was using "40" shutter-open-time and ISO400, right
03so I set it to those in manual mode
03and it blurs.
03Why
guys do i tell him
07anti-shake feature?
?
?*
07also
Rebuilt
07at 1/40
03um
03this camera is old as frick
07that makes fast moving things pretty blurry
03there is no anti-shake feature
Look at it go
dat secrecy
03I've never seen anything faster than 1/40 in auto mode
03o.o
IDIOT !
03my camera supposedly does up to 1/100 though
use 1/100 or above plz
03or down to?
taht's not subtle
stop spinning and you can make it futher :3
Woo horror movie marathon
02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rk47qS5aWs <-- LOL @Top Comments
:O
....
03BlueFlare join the conversation
ESCAPE !
there is no escape from Celestia today
shorter shutter speeds = less blurry, bit dimmer
*but
03er wait
03I can do up to 1/1000
03or down
02hurr
03what's a "good" amount to do
ok, perhaps I stand corrected...
07anything faster than 1/100 should eliminate most blur
Epic!
Didn't think you had the RCS fuel left to do it, but... ok.
/me blushes
Woooooo
13000
03woah
03but ISO80? Is that normal?
03I have it in manual mode, but with "auto ISO"
its OK
lower ISO = lower noise but dimmer
yeah, that is escape
07lol
03mfw
it's a balancing act of 3 parameters
it'll just take a LONG time.
03even with manual mode on 1/1000 it blurs like crazy when I shake it
ISO, shutter, and aperture
07front-facing flash...and looking 'good'
02If I want good lighting but also want fast speeds, I set the aperture to 2.5-3.5
07that just amuses me
03Kyu I'm not a professional :P
where is dickshep
03uh
03isn't 2.5 really slo?
03*slow
Hello
02aperture
I like pinkie pie
03my camera does it in terms of 1/x
03like 40 is 1/40 seconds
03o.o
Hi
072.5 aperture is really wide
07you get less depth of field
yeah, needs warp 1 million.
03like it goes from -2EV to +2EV
07might be manual light settings
lot of debris at where I assume Minmus and Mun are.
07yeah
all scared shitless
inb4 kickage
03ah hm
<3LY
03it does seem to be a manual light adjustment
good thing Kerbs don't need to eat drink or breathe. Cause they're not getting back home
<3LY IN MY GOWN
oh no singing
03and don't say effort values or I smack you
dat allcap singing
dat autokick
WUT DEY DUNT NO IZ DAT AI HAV FULED DEM ALLL
07exposure value
03hm.
02EV stands for exposure value
maybe
03ah THAT's aperture
if he sings fast enough
03the two cnoices I have
03*choices
032.8 and 5.6
03o.
Stream?
03*o.o
00,10suppose I could continue a bit on dickshep
ASDFJKLL;
07lol
:);):P
dickshep?
035.6 seems to make it brighter but blurrier?
waaaaa?
03granted it's a tiny LCD :P
00,10or some one else can take over streaming soon if they want.
I'm in ET but not on the coast
can i?
075.6 would make it darker
dat kick
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'MM back :)
03hm.
03When the zoom is set fully to the W side, you can select an aperture, F2.8 or F5.6.
03When the zoom is set fully to the T side, you can select an aperture, F5.2 or F10.
03You can select a shutter speed from 1/1000 to 30 seconds.
03The difference between the settings and proper exposure judged by the camera appears as an EV value
03(page 31) on the screen. 0EV indicates the value judged as the most suitable by the camera.
03from the manual
my hope was answered
03why does zoom make the picture blur easier
03o.o
03given the same settings
07because that's just how optics work lol
03odd
03well
.. ow my arse
03you can just not zoom
03and crop
03:{
03*:P
/me runs
03nah but like, going from 4MP to like 12+
03is a huge leap
;map
lmao*
07more
02The lower the aperture the bigger the opening is thus the brighter the photo is.
00,02i'ma finish something quickly then if someone else hasnt taken over i'll show my trick
02The higher the aperture is the dimmer the photo is. High aperture also raises depth of field
07something like 30
trick?
02^
03really?
07yep
O_o
03well, before it starts getting noijsy, right?
03-j
03technically you can scan at whatever resolution you want xD
Alright
its a trick for bunnehs not kids
07you don't scan film lol
03*field
nobody's being responded to!!here's my chance........BOOOOOOBIES
lol my thing says .co.nz
03n
Pawnch!
07well, you /can/
07but that's not how pictures are printed
Lol i hope he does that xD
he;s gonna duct tape 3 of those towers of doom together
03yeah but if you're talking megapixels
see if he can push the mun
03that involves scanning?
Any pony else here watched "Brave"?
03for some reason all mine are skewed to the left which means "too dark" xD
02the more depth of field you have, the less blurry out of focus objects are
03ah
goooood night,everpony!!!!
03so if you want some cinematic "everything behind my subject is blurry", you use lower aperture/
03?
00,10ok because it has been a long time.
02yep
07when a negative is exposed onto photo paper, you can get a much larger picture out of a 35mm film camera than you can most DSLRs before they start to turn fuzzy
good night good night good NIGHT!!!:'(
03oh
03I remember back in the 90s
07they're 'equivalent,' but not really compared side by side
03Selects the still image quality.
03Fine (FINE) Records with high quality (low compression).
03Standard (STD) Records with standard quality (high compression).
03Why would anybody use standard?
03like seirously
03XD
03*seriously
03This camera is awesome... shame it's old :/
03it eats up a set of AA's like every 10 minutes
02I have a photography e-book I can give you if you want drf XD
nvm
newp
just got really queit
queit
./.....
well, I was seeing if anyone here saw "Brave"
quiet
03You cannot use the following functions in the [Multi Burst] mode:
crap
03Lame.
wrong channel
07that
everybody quiet now :(
07sounds dumb
00,10sorry for delay had to patch
02also drf
03what, burst mode?
03it's nice when you want to take loads of pictures XD
00,10will set up shortly
03as low as possible
/me hides
07flash on multi...
well, going to be?
03that $300 one I found is a bit on the expensive side, really
07wait, no
07I'm thinking of multiple exposure
11,01Hope there are no leaks.

03well
03*as
07yeah
03mine just goes "LOL NO FLASH"
02my camera can do that and focus at the same time
07so if you did burst
07and some with
03so it takes a second or two between shots
03but still lets you be lazy :P
BUTT CLENCHING UUUURRR
03his camera is cool except that it's huge

03yeah OK
03because I totally can't just do t.hat later in an image editor
lol, i was still seeing the capsule in KSP but i was heaing the audio from this
/me runs
I always did hate the Mass Effect Series :P
ded
lol dat grenade
03hm
11,02I think I'm hungry... O.O
11,02YEAH :D
*dying
02they can help
Nom*
03well
02my dSLR has one
00,02NEVER
lawl
02most canons do
xD
11,01Rockets are computer-piloted for the most part.
00,02it lacks many instrimuents you realy need
03any idea why? XD
00,02dat moment when you fail epic hard
whos Cipher? lol
02you're sure you don't want a dSLR? :P
03yes.
0,14me
Saxy
oh
hi saxy :3
03apparently mine has enough features as-is minus the lack of a higher ISO mode
Cipher: wednesday next week sound good?
0,14sure
then ded
02http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_sx130_is <-- have you looked at this camera yet? It's a point and shoot
02derp
07the multi-flash thing is to give eyes time to adjust to brighter light
How did you play this mission, Cure or no Cure
:D
02has 12x zoom
aw
be*
you're oozing something
:D
03ah
03I just hate blinding the people I'm taking pictures of
02>Canon
02XD
03plus removing red-eye in photoshop isn't too hard
you? put something into orbit??
how about adding red-eye?
PHYSICS!
Is this just fantasy?
03right
03it still blinds you though
03especially if you take more than one picture
03that, and it makes it take longer
oh please don't type out Bohemian Rhapsody
03anyone here used Olympus cameras?
03what pissed me off about those
-____- *
03is the fact that even though the shutter speed was fine
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
03it would take like 10 entire seconds from the time you pressed the shuter button
03until it saves the pitcure
03*picture
HAX
02hurr, you should watch that product demo drf
07that just means it has a crap buffer lol
03buffer? o.o
no shit
then*
07basically ram for a camera
03ah
XD
I get no sympothy
03also, what's a "raw" image, just like uncompressed?
star fox = YES!!!!
07completely uncompressed, yeah
03how's it different from PNG then?
because I'm easy come, easy go. Little high, little low
07much bigger
ded
03PNG is uncompressed...
data straight off the sensor
03at least in MS Paint
You failed the mission
03well
07it incoporates more data from the camera
RAW has more data than PNG iirc
03is that like, compacting the image or
03what'
ded
XD
ye
03*instantly
maybe
07raw would take up more of the buffer
like a rogue
03see this is foreign to me
03all cameras I've ever used have saved as JPG
03-j
or want to have lots of control over the photo afterwards
07your dad's should shoot in raw
03well it might, he doesn't have it set as such
03he also has his set to 4x6
03and not 4:3
07...
07why
03why at which
074:6
03ah
03because he's stupid
/me runs
03-z
03but his are all in 4x6-ratio
You usually sleep at Ash's mom's house

02problem is, due to the bigger size of CMOS, most point and shoot cameras don't have CMOS
13rain rain~
07yes
<3
07CMOS is a type of sensor used in cameras
LAWL
02it's not the same thing
03so same name, different thing?
02yep
...
02just like ISO
03what's ISO stand for in camera-sense
00,02XD
00,02that was excelent

No pony shall see my face or know my real name. No pony.
02ISO 50 or gtfo
03how come with film, the actual film determines the ISO
/me runs
03XD
07because that's how sensitive the film is to light
11,01OK.
03so any film camera would be able to have any sensitivity? o,o
03*o.o
07pretty much
07but you're stuck with it for a whole roll
03well yeah
03I used to use 400

Wait a tf3????
does anyone play tf2 on xbox 360 anymore or did it die out?
11,01They would move everything to TF3.

I have one just two more to go
anyone noticed the TF2 update with the advanced MVP statistics?
Anyone elses stream keep lagging?
ayup
i used to buy items for tf2 too... its not a good thing to do i understood that
Roughly every five seconds it buffers the stream for me.
same here
I usually buy few hats and weapons. Whatever is in sale
is on*
05i only buy mods for my strange items
^
05it varies
Still waiting for Dawnguard..
hm cool
Metroid Fusion is awesome.

00,02streams going down for a sec
00,02allso
00,02DAT WAS AWESOME
No pony panic
This is awesome
We need more games set in places other than the US. Like say Nepal.
Or poland
Too many Merican games I guess
00,02theres an email here
00,02from nigeria
00,02:3

00,02i'm doing a good playthrough
00,02so as non-lethal as posible and free the hostages
00,02dx:hr

Oh ok
F**k it. I am a consumer whore. I'm buying krater special pack now. >_<
00,02Lil_B, i'm not sure
Someone hit me hard.

No you don't
00,02i like the options here
00,02"i like em" "i dont like em" "shut up and stop asking questions"
haha
I just realised I was wearing shades the entire time O.o
00,02FairysHuff, i've thought about it and am honestly not sure wether i'd want augs
I put my sun glasses at night
I would never buy something like Skyrim or Diabolo 3 Special Edition for 199 or whatever
I wear. It's I wear Toy..
00,02'neural enhancments' sure, but lobbing of limbs? yeah, no
00,02XD
yeah, well, next step after neural enhancements is neural hacking
I was watching some music videos and thought shades would be appropriate. forgot to take them off
Yeh thats one thing I would avoid getting. Be permanently in autistic mode ala GotS
05id rather wait for the nano augs
00,02jensen's voice somewhat disturbs me
ikr
Well just bought Krater... And I feel dirty and ashamed. ~_~ I'm a bad bad pony.
05FairysHuff: play the first deus ex ;3 its all about the nano augs
considering that they can do a lot of it today...
well, he did nearly die
he pretty much did die
Woah

I have 3 insufferable dogs and 6 cute wittle puppies.
yeah
it was really sad
I remember when i had hamsters when i was younger /)^3^(\
i had a hamster once his name was mickey
Since I live with my grandparents I can't have pets. Wouldn't be fair to my grandparents.
how did we get to talking about pets?
magic

Animals make great pets, I siad.
Birds are silly :D

Now way!! I want one! :o

all I see is how to be gangster
IT'S A TRAP
00,02Spectrum_Rush, quite a lot
Alright
00,02Spectrum_Rush, no :(
00,02RaveBrony, yup
aww
00,02its worth it
Oh cool :o
:P
It is good and I suck at racing games.
neat
did fluttershy have any scenes where she eats food?
for some reason I can't remember any
I was too busy drooling over her ^_^
maybe she doesn't eat?
she feeds on kindness
>:D
^
yup
lol
plot twist
10yawnrawr
looks pretty cool
Season 3, episode 1: turns out they didn't wipe out all the changelings
*reference?
I'm pretty sure
a canterlott wedding
dont tell me you havent seen that eoisode yet
canterlot*
oh
oops :P
phew
lol
The only thing I tend to get upset about is when people start drama.
:D PIRATES
very
whats it about
it's a 2D physics based shooter
it's got fully destructible terrain
etc.
how much is it going for
well you can get it on non-steam
does this count as advertising?
:/
Pian never stops
Ever
how'D that happen?
*pain
it's quite expensive
$20
CRUSH
00,02alexxm, i'm thinking about that
00,02think it might work
Just one little mind crush, it'll barely hurt him
CRUSH HIM
Is this Deus Ex and should I get it
crush him
00,02well that didnt work
I have it only at the training mission for the past 12 months lol
:O
Thanks
Well that worked :$
That was good timing
he nad
*mad
Yawnrawrs.
00,02alexxm, NO :<
come on it'll be fun
00,02alexxm, i have no where near enough ammo
Is Invisible War worth getting
Hat: No
00,02alexxm, even less tranqs
Yeah just knock em out
00,02FairysHuff, wheres this ladder?
Lol
a) invisible war wasnt bad
b) it was made by a team
00,02Spectrum_Rush, yeah, the preoder one
00,02Chrysalis, its engine re-loads itself just to load a level
neat
00,02only played ~15 minutes, it looked meh, but still
wow... the stream is WAY behind
half a minute, at leat
Here comes the fun
awww
NOO
MW3 is worst
yes, it is on the other side of the fence
Invisible War is worth 4c
its a wallet
It's TOTALLY worth 4c
are we talking about the horrible CoD franchise?
:D
perhaps
i got there by stacking the gabrage containers in front of it
Okay. I shouldn't be complaining about games that I haven't played.
Even though i play CoD i regret why i didnt choose bf
Call of duty is good for the economy. terrible for players
wow
I bought Invisible War on launch. Was extremely dissapointed
Heroes & Generals is where it's at
this might work
It's probably worth more than $0.04. How much more is most certainly subjective.
00,02gota take down stream for a sec
I dunno why I never thought of that.
well i did choose CoD
now watching bf3 clips..
well
uhh
if we talk about FPS games
everyone knows CoD right?
TF2 is best online shooter
yeah
^
well
i WANT to buy bf
but the possiblities..
00,02Kandarihu, havent shown it
00,02FairysHuff, well shit
Okay. Thanks.
No I am not.
I have no respect for BF3
13Yes you are, don't deny it :3
heheh ^_^
don't think i can trade all the CoD games for a one percent discount on bf2:BC?
Disreguard CoD and BF play TF2
I am
sleepy
i do
bad company is not part of the bf2 line
best FPS and it keeps improving
bf3 is bf2's successor
though premium veterans are being such a douchebags
Is Livestream not free anymore?
uh 10 bucks weapons unlock thing?
Has anyone played Heroes & Generals
oh i see
well look at it this way
not to be a 'pro'
oh... you're that blockhead
Spongebob in a nutshell?
And suddenly silence.
Well, bye dudes!
bye
00,02i think dats enough dx:hr for tonight
Hello everypony :)
hay
00,02FairysHuff, no, i'll keep looking later on
thats not ponies..
00,02lets see if i cant manage the trick
TIME TO BLOW UP ROCKETS :D
I can see a lander
And now it's time for me to pause the stream like a responsible viewer rather than complain. ^_^
Damn i hate the AWP in Counter Strike Source lol
DAT KSP
OBAMATART
O.O
LOL
oh
LOL
uh-oh
THATS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

00,02dats the trick
Well, that was cool

I want to see you go at mach 10
00,02nope, they surviviec
00,02survived

Thanks for showing us that.
http://baka-neku.deviantart.com/#/d54okpv me and a friend made this :3
00,02i'ma try a mun landing
well, I have to deaktivate my Stream, I'm downloading to much right now XDE
and i am going to throw my shit at you
ok i think i missed something
00,02:<
Can mips.tv record the screen without an extra device
00,02the fuel lines disapeared

Uh oh

DUN DUN DUUUN
hello everypony

gurren lagann is best anime ever
00,02i'm trying to land on the tower
'Land'?

Aaaaaand BOOOM

xDd they survived!!
AND THEY LIVED :D
OH CMON rEALLY
fav animes
It would only be ridiculous if this were scripted.
anyone up to stream the stream?
00,02this is actualy the first successfull launch
00,02every other launch either exploded or had a fuel problem
riiight
10000
woo fatality
Breasts.
they never do
and then there was sex
They're afraid of heights?
then why would they be astronaughts
Bye bee
bye
:D
brb going to eat some foods
00,02yeah
well
00,02you realy dont
00,02but it looks like i'm on track for a mun intercept today
00,02if i can not explode on landing then we get to see luna :3
00,02and i have tonns of fuel left
00,023 and a half tanks
00,02Spectrum_Rush, :)
EEZ LIE
00,02now i need to slingshot around kerbin
you should land on the moon and leave the kerbals there for a THOUSAND YEARS
very bad feeling..
this has gone bad
00,02poo
00,02missed the mun
00,02gota wait for its next orbit
when should that be
there they scream again :D
waaaah
lol
00,02so lets try to avoid that
whyyy
http://www.kerbalcomics.com/
00,02and now for the long booring landing process
why
Luna wer'e here :)
:) I'm saving that comic
:D
*puts tray in closed, upright position*
Because nothing worth having is easy.
But not everything difficult is worth having.
00,02straight as an arrow
00,02i meen litteraly, this thing flexes like an arrow
00,02should probably look at that sometime
You good folks may be somewhere else entirely.
yeah perhaps
00,02kinda want to detatch it though
00,02use where it explodes as a gauge for the height
00,02brb
inb4 the pause fails
00,02hopefully i dont explode
00,02landing is the hardest part
sarcasm right?
I'm back
you can doit
00,02lol
00,02i has a whole tank still
you just need to go below 10 mps
or is it 12?
i cant tel how close the surface of mun is
We're coming Luna! :D
3.3-1.5 = 1.8kn
right?
00,02shit
00,02gounds higher than 1.5
Jack Daniels should stick to whiskey, their cola mix isn't great
hopefully you don't land on a mountain
Winter wrap-up is stuck in my head
halp
I am
a little bit too much
Only 2000 feet!

Hello everypony!
00,02getting back is much easier
00,02no pesky atmosphere

Equestria :P
wait, equestria's a continent isn't it?
at least a country
It has been great! NOT One of my friends divorced with his RP husband.
yeah
00,02i might not have enough fuel
00,02oh poo
I think Equestria is more of a region or country
00,02note to self: larger fuel tank on the lander
oops
00,02last time i did this i wasnt hauling around an rcs tank
:P
00,02on the plus side
00,02i managed to use the rcs thrusters to put us in an intercept with kerbin
00,02Irish_Pony, i have no clue

Hey look it's Luna

00,02Custard, yeah
00,02cheating a bit but yeah
that is a straight orbit
http://derpy.me/m8f31
that's not even an orbit
00,02de-orbiting from the sun is a little hard without cheats
00,02LochNessCheez, yeah, its called falling
XD
xD
:D
00,02i'ma just accelerate toward the sun
00,02speed dis up a bit

brb
meh

00,02little more than half the speed of light
half the speed of light

lol
00,02science doesnt apply here
or some sun tan lotion
00,02nope
00,02it crashed into the sun
try to go the speed of light
00,02which i though was imposible
00,02but aparently not
00,02LochNessCheez, that would take too long
00,02alexxm, oh, you meen saved to a file
see if it's possible
00,02its saved
00,02this flight exploded
00,02we went to see luna
00,02survived
00,02went to see celestia
and now you killed her
00,02she killed us
00,02:<
wait
00,02LochNessCheez, no, we left her on kerbin
celestia killed luna
:O
oh
celestiais a harsh mistress
we did?
00,02yeha
00,02desktop pony != luna
WELL IT SUCKS TO BE HER THEN :D
Luna is pretty pony +w+
I would have thought luna would want to go see her sister
00,02LochNessCheez, considering we exploded
00,02i'm fine with her staying on kerbin
kk
00,02i cant wait until season 3 :3
