hi
/me deopers
XD
crap, why do our servers not set +x on connect :U
need to hostmask bopm
just ask if you want one
okay
you'll have to show me how to do that
later
arti preference I believe, since the beginning of the network
make bopm set it on connect, or give it a nickserv reg and make a hostmask
vhost*
well, just go to #ZNC in here and type !request
I'm lazy though
hm
shame BOPM doesn't let me use !cmd or something in here
could probably mod it to do that but...

10Someone go to my profile and keep refreshing, I want to see if the image rotator works for my forum avatar
10http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=2262
12I already did, but it don't work :P
10Firefox doesn't seem to like it
10And on Safari (inb4 drf), it changes once and never again
12Let me see if IE8 likes it
10Meh, I just tested the link in my signature and it works
10Stupid hosting site only allows signatures
12Why not try a picture slideshow in a .gif file?
03EW SLIDESHOWS AS VIDEOS
12lol, I mean for her avater XD

10How would I do that?

03HML, it's this

03just with the title "F You" instead :P

12php is confusing, lol
03why can't people just have normal avatars
10I think there's a mod on avatar rotating for Simple Machines
10rotating script*
12Actually, mods are the preferred way of installing things on SMF
Or control alt >
10Not the literal meaning
03oh
03still, why?
If not impossible :P
12Seeya
12Wait, drf, you do have a .gif avatar XD
03it's the same picture every time :P
12It's not a picture though, it's a animated gif
12I was thinking about having a animated PNG file as a avatar, but I forgot IE is crappy about APNG files

I loved the 3rd, the 2nd was good, but the 1st is mehish
04I like them all.

if drf asks universehosting I can recompile his server to work with IPv6

IPv6 is a pain for me

Should I give this idiot
a bouncer from HoR's service?
I'm trying to decide
04a bouncer?
yeah
the bouncer connects to the server
04oh
04Well
04why call him an idiot?
and you connect to the bouncer
and basically, when you disconnect, the bouncer stays online for as long as the bouncer server is online
and can also replay logs to you
well
he literally has no intelligence
04Then...why bother?
04well
04if it's just a lack of knowledge
04then sure I guess
04I thought you meant*
but he's an idiot
like
really really really an idiot
04Like me?
no
oh well

I've never seen anyone with a rune higher than 9 though
cashshop galore for 13 or?
actually reading the comments to his posts he's being trollol'd
I heard an estimate that level 13 runes would cost $2,000 each
i think its in the rune section on the CS
They help you make runes
maybe more

Um
Hi
I sped through a park zone
basically I just got really nervous and screwed up everything

I also got "points" because i dont move my head enough
they probably thought you weren't looking in the mirrors

12has it ever been proven beyond a benefit of a doubt
I know this is old news, but it's bugging me again
http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-01-prop_n.htm
Idk
They're such freakin' babies about Prop 8.
Has it been proven false? :P

Hey
Stryker: You know, I dunno.... I'm absolutely against LGBT discrimination of course, but I'm a little uncertain as to whether or not he should have recused
but
I still prefer milk over anything, though.
Just because a person is straight, doesn't mean they won't have a bias either.
Everyone has a bias.
The legal standard is written more like whether someone could be percieved to have biases towards a case
Where someone's "impartiality might be questioned" I think is the legal phrasing of it
But
No.
He's straight!
:3
/me goes back to lurking
/me hugs Curly
/me hugs
Marriage isn't strictly a religious thing.
that's the main thing.
Yeah
Ideally all judges haven't even heard of the case before it goes to trial
b/c then they're totally impartial
And it dominated.
I assume I'm talking about the correct subject here
I kinda jumped in.
I don't know anything about the case either and why it's held to be unconstitutional
Having played it yet. . -.
Prop 8?
Yeah
I mean
But I don't know about the court history
Pretty sure the legal basis was something along the lines of "there's no reason to do this"
/me often disagrees with the means but agrees with the ends with cases involving constitutionality in court
as in it doesn't serve a legal purpose.
as far as I could tell
but hey let's talk about something less... controversial eh?
State laws don't have to have a legal purpose, only federal laws :3

lemme dig up my TA,
I saw a "restored" cut episode
I hated it
i know which one ("james boobs")
it looked mutilated and horrible
I hate restore attempts for cuts
because most of the time they don't work
not all restores are done equal.
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=DR791EXP < drf, you can see/listen how i did it.
i made uncut for M4. drf has it.
please
03anyway
03downloading
unlike "james-boobies" one.
the PocketMonsters restore of Beauty and the Beach was just botched badly
& a music edit at the start (MPM specialedit) & the end (you & me & pokemon)
don't restore those
i did hybrid/that for M12
its not much to ask

My router is a rWire

well, not when you read every vamp book that u can lay ur hands on.
:)
not necessarily.
/me smirks
i'm a writer. i can create my own species vamp.
:)
my vamps are like nocturnal animals, its more comfortable to go around only at night, but not impossible.
lol the only diff to my species in the light thing. everything else is the same.
right, meaning same mobility restrictions would apply
vamps can run fast, wheres the mobility restrictions?
i leave no survors.
survivors*
I would survive
never did understand how a vamp can function after a bullet to the head though
k, gonna play some games, bbl

Hi
I thought this was the sillychannel?
03it is, but going !everyone just looks stupid
03especially when people know darn well most people don't ahve those scripts.
drf, loosen up
I don't see the problem
half of what's said here is just as interesting as the !<name> lines anyway.
03that's a matter of opinion
03I know
03I never said it wasn;t
03see, was that really necessary?
03everyone but those 4?
Loosen up
You can set up #serious if you want to
03I don't mind sillyness now and then but you also abuse scripts quite a lot
|!eXAKR
/me now belongs to lightumbreon|Gaming for 14 minutes

I thought TST was a laid-back and for-fun thing, not a srsbsns thing.
You know me as the script abuser
Everyone knows that
nofunallowed.jpg
kby
03well
03it's also the fact that by doing !name, you're triggering any potential nick alerts that people have set up and I don't think people appreciate when you do that when they intentionally don't have a script for that reason
Like !leafeon
03yeah but you do it all the time
Though I understand the annoying part
03it just makes them look like an idiot
i really don't care about nickalerts
03neither do I, but some people do
03I have them completely disabled. I think they're stupid.
/me cares slightly, but goes by the philosophy of 'rather one too many than one too few'.
meh
when i'm actually on mIRC and someone is trying to get my attention i find it helpful
but i idle in 3 or 4 different networks usually
03I'm only ever on two networks, and only two truly active channels
06opinions everywhere
06and now I vanish again
hade Espeon
k
03hade?
04hi
I'm on five different servers
A desktop skinning commuinity
But here? Meh
03and seriously, if you think I'm bad, you should try #RawkSD
03they banned me because they hate me
03I hate elitist circlejerk groups
03eXAKR, let me just put it this way
#RawkSD is #RawkSD, #silverwings is #silverwings
!list
03I get as annoyed with you trying to nick-trigger everyone on the channel as people do with me saying EW APPLE all the time./
...
03same idea.
then that off-topic here
*that's
03not really
Either way
03I know
As long as it's not all the time, people tolerate it
I don't spam all the time
03yes
But whenever people talk about Apple, or 5th gen Pokémon, you start ewwing
03whenever you;'re here you start nicktriggering
03how is there a difference
03bottom line here is that people get annoyed at silly things :P
06Yes. And if one side "must just deal with it otherwise they're oversensitive" then that goes for everyone. And that's all I have to say (again) about it.
03I never said I was *offended* by it
03that's the difference with that one
03anyway
03I'm gonna go run a couple errands
03so bbl
06Alright~
drf
All I can tell you at this moment is
Loosen up
And don't be annoying
People have the right to scriptspam a bit
and 5th gen Pokémon
As long as it's not something like

I see that holding an intellectual conversation is really convenient in this channel.

did my line get through?
06Yeah xD
okay
well, the point is they don't consider it demeaning
06Some kind of joke or something? o.o
their default reply is 'And I like it!'
06Ahaha
:P
'homophile?'
I never heard of that
I heard of homophobe
oh
but not that
06lolnorwegian
it's synonymous with 'homosexual'

07i adore you
except
07also
06But probably not used that much internationally I guess o.o

10Hi Xeli and LU
they're automated bots
they should be called autobots
10Hi Nick
07lol...
07I was
07told to look at something
07and I pointed out there was no imperfection with the picture itself, but that frequent typos and the like sort of distract me. He's just being a floof back to me because of it
07Didn't really liked me pointing out his writing as a flaw. >.o Oops?
07I guess he asked though...
hum
04mew
as mentioned in 138.. not all take critique constructively.
07Lol i guess....
07It just makes me not want to answer questions honestly though
07Or, at least, only tell partial truths.
his loss, I guess?
07Orrrr be as secretive as ever.
07Yah
07He asked, I answered
:>
07I just find he's full of contradictions sometimes
07I mean... he once praised me for my honesty.
07Now then, regarding this
07he doesn't like it! lol.
07True.
07well that said
07Mhm...
07well considering he has reminded me of an older version of the peregrine
07and because of a convo I had earlier today
07he also was like that
07said things, then contradicted them
07timey is just tons more subtle about it. :p
/me is used to it though. . . .
/me np. «Long Gone Long» - The Rainmakers
07o3o
07because
07floof?
Rainmakers
they were a curious band
mostly popular in Scandinavia, especially Norway
but were from elsewhere somewhere.
07ah
07never heard of them
obscure even here, especially now after their main period
s'my dad's CD from back then.
07aha^^
/me np. «One That Got Away» - The Rainmakers
o/` Older than I used to be, younger than I'm gonna be; Fewer things puzzle me than when I was young.. o/`
o/` But when my pace is falling slack, I catch myself thinking back - a certain night, a certain summer.. Long gone long.. o/`
:OO
:3
:o
03LOOOL @ this
03and my momw as like "it's too loud to be outside... it's probably trapped in our house soemwhere"
03turns out
;o

03I'm like LOL I can't believe that
Oh the puns x.x
Wow
lol
lol
03I know right
Take her phone and add you saying "EW BIRDS" to it
Now you can legally by cigarettes :D
03I never said EW BIRDS
03I have no problems with the
03m
03I'
Until now
:P
03I'm just not a fanatic like some people here
And you're at the age of consent in every state in the U.S.
lol yeah, ik. my friend was trying to get me to smoke with her
03it's really obnoxious
And
lol
07o3o
07and
sisi
03to hear stupid binging noises every 2 seconds
07then there were
XD
07peadges
03especially since my sister is a social magnet
03with like 800 friends on AIM
You can sign contracts
/me is chewed on
03you have any idea how annoying that is?
I, personally, don't use them.
03hearing those noises that often?
07Haha
07but
07because whenever I sign on somewhere
03I literally don't use anything
07I get like 3+ people IMing me within the minute
07o3o
07so it's like
07nbut
07If I dont have them
07=p
07so its like
03the window doesn't pop up?
07sounds = response
07nou
03o.o
03that's... odd
ya?
there's no 'popping up' for my irc either
lol, thank you (:
03I never said IRC
:D
/me dies
D:
03so you're saying I'm not?
03D:"
but you ruined it with the word 'chatroom protocol'
07o3o...
/me chews on irc.
03but IRC *is* a chatroom protocol, is it not?
03I'm just stating facts :P
:D
03American term
no
03IRC channels are chatrooms
irc is not a room
03orly
you're talking about channels
03*:P
furthermore, it's not a channel protocol
it's a relayed text-over-ip protocol
yes
03minus the word rooms if you want, that's a more Americanized term :P
lol
03hence the name.
nawp
the room part has no home in the protocol definition.
WHY NOT??
07yeh but ... it's not technically a room then
07o_O
there is no such thing as a 'chatroom protocol'
03well
!define chatroom
cuz hubby dont want me to
D:
03minus the word site
03that's kinda a stupid definition
03get rid of "a site"
that i could move out
lol
:Oo
Something that I can do
03I realize it can be used for other things too
XD
03but it's PRIMARILY used for chatting
07No because irc isn't a 'room' per se o_O
I know XD
03well channels = rooms
no.
07No.
07... LOL
Yes
07fjfs
03you're arguing with a native English speaker here :P
Yeah ;o
03you probably just have a different term for it
03in Norwegian
03or something
07drfsupercenter, you didn't go into technical terms though
07o_O
I've had a native English speaker tell me
Haha
that English came from Latin
03English is just a weird language
now that must surely be correct since she was native?
03it came from everywhere
nor did it do that.
03orly
07DRF
03English words come from just about every language
07so
07moot arguments really.
07o_O
umz
idk
07Spanish.
gimme a sec
English develloped on the basis of the Germanic Anglo-Saxian language
later it was influenced by the French
03yes but there are words in English that come from many languages
also, Norsemen.
Like Tacos *nod*
07So the above-mentioned -> everywhere?
07o_O
03LOL
03I meant more like "llama"
03the animal
damnit
03which also comes from Spanish
03:P
cool whip is gone
07insofar I know
07those areas
07arent everywhere
03Lakorv, more like the reverse
03English stems from every language
03more or less
03it may be developed off one or another but in today's day and age, words in the ENglish language come from everything
<...<
file:///C:/Users/Breizy44/Downloads/Photo1715.jpg
every language which includes an English word
would stem from English.
07o3o...
:o
03You sure enjoy picking my sentences apart, don't you
07drfsupercenter
English in itself came from Anglo-Saxian, French and Norse.
07your imprecise language allows such to happen.
07and
Remember that girl on my friends list you were creeping on?
03LOL imprecise
07your arguments have little substance to them
07Indeedu
Yes I remember her :3
the vocab has however been expanded by means of words from many other languages.
... I think
I creeped on a bunch of htem
07because it's such a loosely structured sentence/content.
her name is katy
07and hmn
07o3o
03so of course I'm not going to go around talking like I';m a dictionary
07are you complaining?
07^--
07this
03I never said yelling or accusing
03o_O
03I said picking my sentences apart
The one looking for a fwb?
unless you install apache or something..
03did I say it was a problem?
/me likes where this conversation is headed
07it does have some negative connotations.
07o3o
07when you
o.O u know i know nothing of compies
07said it like this.
there?
lol no
03I never said yelling or accusing in that sentence either.
03I never said I had ap roblem
03+space -space
got a thing against intellectual arguments?
03nope

03meh I don't feel like explaining it on here.
"How do I get this picture online?" "You upload it." "...What?"

No it wasn't
I mean
07then don't. But just stop making somekind of deal out of it really..
07well
xP
They were all online anyway
07I have made my stance clear.
well, you've been making quite a deal out of it when she /was/ ignoring you, too.
:O
03I just like when you actually reply to me, rather than acting like I don't exist.
Yeah, haha
:P
this is when I was like 14
On my first forum
:P
LOL
How old are you now
?
20
Oh
Hmm
girl

07I just think you're rather unpleasant. Either way you're being mean, me acknowledging you or not.
yeah I know lol
07Anyway
xD
07I don't feel like carrying this discussion any further, either
03I fail to see how I'm being mean but I don't need to go into it.
07I's going to do other things
how old are you, Jason/Sally?
03since you clearly don't want to
07Why should I want to?
Wait no
Jason's 15
:P
she just turned 24

I am still talking to you from 1 hour in the future
03what would you suggest instead then
How are you today?
:O
03having two computers using one set of keyboard/mouse
07I'm icky
03and monitor
07but
07happy
heeey.... do they have chipotlez in the future?
07^v^
I feel like i missed a lot too sometimes
03I mean, luckily the second computer is just a machine I built for like $200 to record TV onto
03but I still need to be able to control it
have fun.
07I define physically being okay as different from being emotionally okay XD
like I said
they do, but it is now considered healthfood
03Lakorv, how do you change between computers then
03if you aren't using a siwtch
noice
03o.o
03is that like VNC?
no.
07thanks!
03hey, I was just asking for help, but whatever
/me cuddles the raven happily
haha
oh, you were?
03yes
03I'm curious how you can do it without using a KVM switch
seedbox
03I forgot to type a ?
web server
irc server
no
IRC client
(What's a seedbox?)
you asked 'how' and 'is it like'
I answered both.
03um OK
07=P
03but the pasting the "have fun" comment made it clear you didn't want to help me
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox
of course it is.
03hm
Oh, OK
Yeah
networking is kind of cross-platform.
03I mean, I can use TeamViewer to control the other computer but that seems silly when it's right next to me
blarg
03since it unplugs the mouse/keyboard from the other machine x.x
I should work on my android app, but I reaaaaly don't want to
07silly floofs

I wish; the school doesn't allow them though
No
like
03http://themetapicture.com/the-hardest-part-of-any-game/
