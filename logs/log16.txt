The names make me want to rafe
*rage
SSNNNIIVEEH
03inb4 rape
/me cry
Yes
maybe I should hit eBay sometime and see if I can find some second generation stuff
I was thinking that
I already found first generation stuff as is so the odds are good
4thank you Skylands, for getting me those things =)
10It was funny though
10When I checked my stuff out, the employee asked, "How old is he?"
10As if I was buying for a boy
LOL
Poor you
But it's the truth
10I told him it was for me, he went a bit silent
He doesn't approve of Gen 5 either
that or the shock of someone over the age of 20 buying current Pokemon stuff
Yeah :P
4Skylands is a teen or an a-dult?
/me is 16, but yeah
4oh lol
But yeah :3
4timing
10I get mistaken for an 18 year old all the time
I still thought you were 17
Oh..hehe
4you must be tall than
105'6"
Or just horribly aged
Midget :P
10and people say I *look* older
4sorry, i have no idea how tall that is XD
Chaomaga, what
10About average for a girl, Chao
How can you not know what 5ft something is XD
metric system
What system do you use o.o
10He uses a different metric system probably
EW
4yesh
/me 4does
10You use centimeters?
4those were feet right?
that's probably around 1.5 m or so
4oh ok
or 2m
Nah
in between there
2m is like.. 7 ft
Not even sure anymore :P
yeah
Such a silly system
so 1.5 then
most of the world uses it, hml
:P
Yeah ;P
But at least we use both
7Thanks, Chao. :D
i figured we were the only ones that used customary units
4you is welcome
4anyting else?
7Hmm, nah.
10Anyways, that's the first time I've ever been asked that o.o
4kk
7Actually...
7Ho-oh.
Where does Chaomaga live?
7It's the only legendary I don't have. O_o
4in my house
What country
4Canada
10Chao, I thought you spoke Spanish?
4shiny?
4i do
O.o
10And you're from Canada..?
Darned Canadians
SKY! :3
4i'm tri-lingual (mispelled for sure)
7Uh, not necessary, Chao.
Skylands, they're kind screwed up, so expect anything
/me shot
/me 4is mad
skylands, how many years of spanish have you taken so far?
/me 4noms on it
!pokemans
just out of curiosity
103, Kosovo
10HML, wat.
oh, cool
7Chao?
same
4yes?
7Did you disconnect from wi-fi trade?
i wanted to take a fourth
7I'm waiting. o3o
4well no why?
but my school had too bad of budget cuts to keep it
10Canada is awesome
4i'm busy typing :P
7Ah, well...
7I'd like to get back to the game. :P
10I'm quitting Spanish after this year, Kosovo
7Unless you have a Ho-oh.
Canada is overrated since they use metric ;p
10I need to focus more on my studies
4lol sowwy
/me flees
7That's all right
7.
4no not yet, must catch one
7Lol.
I see
7What else should I give you?
10And since only 2 years are required to graduate, I've got more than that
10:3
7I have lots of Deinos with Dark Pulse and Ice Fang.
How can you catch a ho-oh o.o
4what you got?
They aren't wild
7Lots of good-natured Tynamo.
4i want dat!!! please.
:P
7The Deinos?
/me 4is a Cheatah
7I'm guessing you'll want a female one? :P
4yesh
7male*
although I took Spanish 1 in junior high, and while that counts for high school credit here colleges don't count it
7Or does it not matter?
so in their eyes I only have 2 years
4i dun really care (though i am sexist :P) if it's trade, gimme a un-genered if it exists
7Un-gendered? O_o
X3
4what level?
Legendaries are usually un-gendered o.o
7 1. :P
7Deino is not a legendary. o3o
/me tackle hugs Skylands :3
/me returns the hug
Well, still.
All pokemon are gendered
:3
4although, shiny, normal, or who-cares?
Unless you port them to Red version
Since I don't think that has genders ;P
4yeah
yep, credit
7Lol.
4Articuno= female Luiga = male :P
you need a certain number of credits to graduate
7Eh, if you want, Shiny. XD
here it's 220 I think
7Goes along well with my Shiny Lugia. O_o
What, they just don't let you leave if you don't get enough?
7(Which some Japanese guy on the GTS traded.)
repeating years
or summer schoolo
*school;
Lol.
ugh, typing's terrible today
None of that here in the UK.
4any item you want?
7Focus Sash would be nice.
If you screw up, then too bad, you can regret it when you're older and actually care.
/me 4is battling a Wild Shiny Ho-oh on Route 4 with a Shiny Zekrom named GoogolPlex
7Lulz.
7Wait, what level is it? O_o
4 1
7It won't matter, just curious.
7Okay. :P
4oh, cause you said one so..........^v^
7Lol.
4let's see, Poke, Great, Ultra, Master, Premier, Cherish, Heal, Net, Nest, Quick, Dusk, Timer, Repeat, Dive, Luxury, Safari and Dream Ball
4what can i throw
7Lololol..
7Luxury?
7Doesn't go too well, but...
7Well, Cherish is the other option.
Bludgeon it to death then put it in a blunder. :D
/me 4is tinking "The hardest part of catching a PKMN is choosing it's permanent Pokeball.........."
...
7I had fun trying to catch Virizion in a Nest Ball because of that. :P
Blender*
a blunderbuss would be more fun
^ Lol.
4whenever i see Cherish Ball, i *always* read it as Perish Ball
7XD
4and i'm like "o_O FTW!?!"

[Drake] Lag with flame.ho-ohrealm.net is 1.107secs
*Something
02All those who like monkeys and 2D platformer MMORPGS
02Go play MonkeyQuest with Pokestar and I
02and me*
04what ever happened to transformice?
02Too many Trollmice
04XD
bbl
02Even friends turned against you ffs,
02ALL I WANT IS CHEESE
02I TOLD YOU TO GTFO NS
lol
7Chao?
04But that's the fun part.
/me 7is on wi-fi.
/me 4knows
4though it's taking long
02It's funny at times, but after a while when people just do that all the time
02I don't get what the point of playing is
02Plus they added player made maps, which means people could troll through that as well
04"I am not a mouse I am a Troll"
/me lols
02I mean, I would get a few friends to play with me in a private room
02And they would start trolling me as well, which got annoying.
04YES
04I survived the anvil caterpillar
02Lol
02But
02You must praise the Anvil God
04XD
02Or Anvil God shall angrily beat your butt of the map in a laggy fashion that you won't know what hit you, except you'll know it was Anvil God
/me 7is trying to communicate. U
02Dreamworld
02Is fun
4what's with the wi-fis?
04XD
4and yesh, Shiny, 'tis
04I swear I'd play this game just to look at the mice.
04They're so cute/
7Eh, mine fluctuates.
02Yes, they are
02Emotes are fun too
7Trying one more time before I reset my connection.
02But Monkey Quest, you're a MONKEY
02A more 3D monkey than the 2D mouse
04XD
02And no download(though Tmice doesn't either, but still)
04so bored...
7Bah, can't get it to connect.
02join MonkeyQuest >:#
04I probably will
02Yay!
http://www.postpcmag.com/ < epic site
4!define epic
04huh
04It actually looks pretty cool
02Told you
02Pokestar and I are having troubles connecting up though
02Maybe we should all join up on Transformice
04If you can be a mage, then I am happy.
04Yeah, and play on a private room so we don't find any trolls.
04haha just let me make my monkey
02I don't think it works like that .-. I'm pretty sure there aren't any classes, but you might be able to use magic later on
02Or have to be a member, because we all know they want their money so they can spend it on advertising
04fff
7X.x
7Ah, forget it.
/me 7resets one more time before quitting.
4:(
4Deino.................
/me 4is about to throw Quany's wi-fi out the window
4the only problem is, how can i do that when you're all the way over there, and i'm alllllll the way over here
02Yeah
04Isaac Rustwolf
just go over 9000
/me wonders who is here
04crap
02Nice
04not good
02Hmm?
04You have to use the arrow keys here, not the ASDW keys ._.
04My right arrow key isn't working fff
02Oh snap XD
04That's not gooooood D:
02Let's go on Transformice then

02LET'S GO ON WOLFHOME EVERYONE
04OHFU-

04I'll meet you on Transformice
02I went on the other day
02And was laughing my arse off
04XD
7Sorry, Chao.
/me 7stops trying for now.
04I went on Mystical Realms, the dragon equivalent of Wolfhome, a while back.
4is ok
02I remember that place
04It's marginally better than Wolfhome, probably because I was talking to one of the mods/admins.
02Not as good
4not your fault it isn't your fault right >_>
04He was pretty cool.
02The art anyways .0.
02Really?
04Yeah
04He was quite sensible.
04But the others in the room weren't as much XD
02XD
02That's always so fun
02And then to sensibly troll them, that's fun too
holy crap that's a lot of banned folks

:/ $800 for an HTPC
what's that?
and i got the midi from the GC section too xD
granted, a kickass one, but still
and seeing as its on MM, i know i can play it xD
I also have
an HTPC is essentially a computer whose main job is to be a media center (play movies, record tv shows, watch internet tv and play music and display pictures) while also being a computer
:o
that's a looooooooooot of mulah
yeah
thats a remix of Time for Kill
one of the best songs on F-Zero GX
stick with dvd player, youtube, ipod, and camera
lol
my own computer only cost me round $700
hmm
lol @ only
:/ that's rather cheap for a quad core gaming computer
190 for the monitor, 17 for the card reader, and soon 70 for a mouse\
02That was fun

that isnt a mouse, that's a friggn transformer thingie bob
lol, I know
good grief
but yeah, standard mice just dont cut it for me
04XD
I need an Optical gaming mouse, with 5+ buttons
and this mouse caught my attention with its ability to be set to different palm sizes and handling styles
lol
that is so insane
meaning I will be able to set it to a configuration most comfortable for me
yeah
could be worse, I could be spending $1500 on a keyboard

drake is drf around?
04Nope
i see
ohai Drake
and what, Umbreon?
i need a server exception for tst
stupid ban range lol
04Sister not home, parents not home...hmm
XD
Ah
Umbreon, what's the ban?
oh right
feather's bro
XD
yeah
actually
I think that ban can be removed
seeing as he has gotten on
i dunno
drf let him back into SW
and the ban causes problems
tbqh we can actually make the ban more direct
as Feather uses a BNC here now
and thus has a different IP
moment though, need to oper up
but he questioned me instead of cooporating lol
geez, redundant bans here
[16:27:59] G *@72.*.dyn.centurytel.net 0 52485017 Articuno!Articuno@articuno.articuno.articuno.articuno :Loser

can't do it for ocean as I don't have access
ohai
lol
loser
oh nevermind
you got it
in
idk
ah okay
there's one with n00b as the reason lol
hi
well Umbreon, you could always use a bouncer if you have problems
because it's technically not ban evading
/me deopers
XD
crap, why do our servers not set +x on connect :U
need to hostmask bopm
just ask if you want one
okay
you'll have to show me how to do that
later
arti preference I believe, since the beginning of the network
vhost*
well, just go to #ZNC in here and type !request
o-o
I'm lazy though
hm
shame BOPM doesn't let me use !cmd or something in here
could probably mod it to do that but...

Ah
I dunno why
I'll check the servers
i just figured out how to make the channel switcher tab bar go to the top of the screen
i hate it being at the bottom
then i also figured out how to make a seperate tab for server messages
pointless windows but i prefer to use those windows for typing identify commands

@ Buizel
that's not how my mirc looks XD
i removed the tree
o_o
ah
i guess it isn't this bad
now that i got these settings in place
i hate how it tiles my background though

Drake ohai
04ohai
04You back now?
blah
how do i change the text color of my nick in x-chat
it's a light gray
yeah I'm back
Buizel
it does it on purpose to highlight it
/me hugs NS
go to Settings
Advanced
Text Events
yeah well done i can't read it XD
And go to Your Message
and you can change %C3 into something else
with 3 being the colour code number
i know
same with nick changing, etc.
make sure you hit enter before switching though
or it doesn't save
and
/me hugs Drake back
I have my xchat modded so much
it's almost exactly like mIRC now
hmm
04NS
04For future reference, here's the newest sprite of Nira

uh
sec Buizel
%C31%H<%H$4$1%H>%H%O%C30$t$2
o_O
%C31<$3$1> %O%C30$2
mine is that
OH
I know why lol
I edited mine to remove the idents and the | line
so mine looks like mIRC
i see
it's the %C31
the text colour is %C30
%C30 is a slightly darker gray
sigh
your nick is %C31
why won't it stick
you have to hit enter
after you input it
or it doesn't save
ok
i hit enter and it didn't change
ok
o_O?
04Is anyone else getting this 'swift sites' thing when they get onto TST?
sec
ah right
Articuno said they're moving hosts @ Drake
04oh
probably nameservers haven't updated properly yet
or they haven't set it up
hmm
04k
so like, I moved my IRC client to another server
apparently the server at my parents place rebooted, and restarted the IRC client

"The real problem ISPs want to fix is congestion due to limited infrastructure.

04I have a Pokemon-related question
go ahead Drake
I wanna live!
uh
I usually use Earthquake
but U-turn is good against psychic types
and dark types, but close combat takes care of that
04Well I have Hydreigon for Psychic types so
earthquake is good for rock, steel and that other one
uh
poison
and
electric
04XD
you could try stone edge too
I'd say Earthquake though
04Stone edge has low PP and a lower chance to hit.
04Team selections are hard
heya HML
Drake lol
it's a great sweeper
04True
04But I have several sweepers already
04Hydreigon and Espeon amoung them.
04But then Toxicroak is kinda crap...

I have some major hackery going on to get connected to Epic Chat
03http://www.dizzy-dee.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ATT00007-300x93.jpg
03rofl
I wonder if there are any gain pots inside of the mid 1980s to mid 1990s Delco car stereos for AM and FM
03http://asset.soup.io/asset/1177/1797_9350_450.jpeg
Show is live in less than 2 hours :3
back, and off for testing some mods :P
on AM mine squeals if I hook anything other than a one or two inch piece of wire
his name is frodo
Then he runs off and delivers them to a boy on his bicycle in China
hm, thanks SS, will remember it ;3
And he bicycles 10 miles until he reaches the outskirts of Peking, China, where he's greeted by a man who got a bronze at last year's olympic sprint
Not too bad but he was hoping for gold
03http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/b7d3a0a9-381d-4b7b-a150-1994b5b26ad7.jpg
And he casually walks up a mountain until he reaches a man, who lights a bonfire, and off in the distance another man sees that the bonfire is lit and he lights his, which creates a cascade effect over 100's of miles of people catching the bonfire signals and lighting their own bonfires to pass the signal down the chain
Until the signal reaches the Epic Chat datacenters, where the people there, half-drunk, attempt to download my messages from that boy on his bicycle back in China
/me nods
:)
No problem
xD
hi

10How would I do that?

03HML, it's this
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKxodgpyGec
03just with the title "F You" instead :P
/me gives skylands a bananaphone for an avatar :>
12First you would need a gif editor like Jasc

hi Ecco :)
hey Nick!
12Then you crop a few files to the size you want and add them to your gif file in the editor
10I'll pass
12I could do it for you if you show my the pictures you want to use
12me*
10I found another site, but it's a 24-hour trial and then you have to start paying :|
12Oh, lol
03so steal the code within 24 hours?
/me runs
10lolPHP
12php is confusing, lol
03why can't people just have normal avatars
03screw super fancy stuff
/me thinks drf wants a fancy flash video avatar
10I think there's a mod on avatar rotating for Simple Machines
10rotating script*
12Actually, mods are the preferred way of installing things on SMF
03why would you want to rotate your avatar
03I don't want to have to turn my head sideways :|
Or control alt >
10Not the literal meaning
03then what o.o
10Image rotation is where an image changes every time you refresh your page
03oh
12The idea of having a new avatar every time someone looks at it does sound very interesting
03still, why?
03just pick one and stay with it :|
If not impossible :P
10Because I wanted to try something new
12Seeya
12Wait, drf, you do have a .gif avatar XD
12And you said you don't like fancy avatars XD
03that's not fancy
03it's the same picture every time :P
12It's not a picture though, it's a animated gif
12I was thinking about having a animated PNG file as a avatar, but I forgot IE is crappy about APNG files
12Only firefox can play them
12Which sucks, because there so much better then gif files
03anyway
03bbl
12Looks like I’ve been swiftly killing the chat :P
12Anyways, bbl

04It's because my friends don't know what rawr is. They'll think it's some random internet meme.

/me flees even moar
04I don't think I will.
10The new designs such
10suck*
Oh, yeah sky :P
04It all depends on what exactly the gameplay is like.
10Not that they were any better for v.2
04I'm not sure if it's an rpg, a strategy game, an action-adventure...
10I prefer originals
I believe I heard of the Spyro series before
never really checked it out
the originals were the best of them
Only play the first 3
the rest are blah
The rest (other than Hero's tale lol) is bad
okay.
thanks for the recommendation :)
honestly though I'm not even really into the originals
I think they're decent, but I'm not a fan
I loved the 3rd, the 2nd was good, but the 1st is mehish
I mean, it doesn't really feel like a spyro game at first :P
04I like them all.
12I adore most Spyro games myself
04I have no outright favourites, but I really enoyed DotD despite it being just above average.
(I never finished the first one since my PS1 card died XD)
/me personally really enjoyed DotD
13I do prefer the originals though~
I hated the Eternal Night
04OHGOD ETERNAL NIGHT
It felt like the recent Sonic games mixed with the worst physics from any platforming game
I never got pass the arena boss thing
04THAT was tough.
The motion controlls were THAT bad
04I eventually remembered I had Ice Fury and used it.
I had the classic controller, eventhat didn't help XD
04OHKO those two Scorpions
OH NO X>x

What does Portal two look like?
what different than the first?
seriously
10The only difference is that the cake is not a lie this time
really?
/me was joking around
7Lawl.
/me falls over
7Well, here we are again. (:P)
I don't like that idea
03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
02WINternetz much
02Did I missed something?
7Portal 2 comments.
04Thoughts: awesome
04Well thought out, achievements were pretty great, storyline was original, and there was a bunch of amazing CGI parts
04And the ending was just awesome
7Length?
04no spoilers
04um
043x the length of the first one
04which is awesome
7And then there's the co-op mode.
04LOL THAT ACHIEVEMENT
04"Lunacy: That just happened"
7o.o
04the achievement Lunacy
7I prefer "The Part Where <spoiler> Kills You"
7Oh, and LOL:
04If you beat the game you'll know why that's awesome
04yes
04This is that part
7My Wooper (will be Quagsire) has max EVs in speed. O__o
7Yet Speed is its lowest stat and it has a speed-reducing nature. XD
04ironic |D
/me 7still needs to breed for IVs. >>
7(Elsethings, lol.)
10Gtg
04btw
Nuuuuuuuuu
04Chell's an idiot
/me huggles Sky goodbye ;-;
04Spoiler: 1,1At the end she doesn't take the HHPD with her >>
04like seriously wtf, 1,1I'd so take it with me despite there being no moon rocks anywhere :V
ooh
7If you decide to go with her halfway through the game.
04I don't think you can decide
04wait
04oh
7Did you get that achievement for it? :P
04you mean when she asks you to just complete the last test?
04yes
04good listener
04|D
04Icon is full of win
o.o
/me yawns
13Goodnight all :3
7AE?
7D:
7But I want to try wi-fi again. o3o
13I'd love to, but I'm struggling to keep my eyes open right now |D
13Tomorrow?
7Okay.
7Wrong time, right place?
04cya
04OMG
04THAT GUY
04PLAYS CAVE
7Lol.
04OH MY GOD EPIC xD
04And I have respect for Stephen Merchant
04He and his brittish accent made Portal 2 "quite a bloody awesome game"
7Ah, that word.
04even though the only blood is from you when turrets shoot you :P
04also
7And that's not even blood.
04pit boss
04epic achievement
04Wait
04I didn't notice; there's no blood in Portal 2 anymore?
7Well, you see a flash of red.
7But no actual blood. o3o
04Huh
04Wonder why they took that out
7E. 10 rating.
04ah
7But other things make it very not E-10.
04yep
04btw
7Personally, I find the Rattmann dens creepy. The music doesn't help.
04that "Scanned Alone" achievement
04I didn't get it on purpose LOL
04I stood in the scanner because I thought I'd somehow break the system
04it didn't even recognize me lul
04btw Quan, that one turret on the redemption line
04that was a live
04*alive
04did you save it?
7Ah, I remember that.
04And furthermore did you hear the easter egg it said?
7The foreshadowing turret foreshadows.
04achievement and egg
04I love Valve
7They are detailed in their works.
7Not the most I've seen, but pretty much.
back
04They only hire the BEST they can get
04and for good reason
04I hope the next game they make is as awesome as P2
04and holy crap
04the references to the first game
04were awesome XD
7Hmm.
7Hoopy the hoop comes to mind.
04Remember the Companion Cube chamber?
7Yep.
04And the (spoiler) 1,1companion cube that came out of the furnice at the end? :3
7Yes.
04I loved that part XD
7Then again, you can emancipate those cubes.
04no
04SEVERAL TIMES ;-;
7They're a dime a' dozen (backstabbing scumbags [referencesREFERENCES]. o3o
7)
04lul
04Black Mesa can kiss my- Sir.
7Ah, Cave.
7Awesome lines Valve wrote for him.
7Combustible lemons!
04Using 1,1Moon rocks
04I'LL BLOW UP YOUR HOUSE WITH THE LEMONS!
lool
04But its weird
04I thought that the Portal gun only worked on soft surfaces
04but apparently the case is they only work on 1,1moon rocks
04Hence why the ending made so much sense :E
;p
But I wonder why Cell 1,1 didn't suffocate there
;O
04Good lungs? XD
04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a2/Portal2-chamber-comparison.jpg <-- Also one of my favorite parts of the game
04The old levels making a comeback
Though, she would of had to deal with worse ;P
04But with more WHEATLY
7But the chambers look so decrepit... o3o
7Wheatley*
7And Chell*
7And HML?
Not to mention higher res :P
Yes?
7Wait, out of context.
7Apologies, let me rephrase:
It was
Badly
7There is air on Earth./
7It was being vacuumed to outer space.
04Many of the mid-game puzzles take place in much larger and open areas of the old Aperture Science facilities to make the space "feel epic", according to programmer Jeep Barnett.
04It worked
Yes, but wouldn't that mean the air was lost so she couldn't get a direct flow
But even with the air issue solved, she would either freeze or burn to death :P
04oh
04yeah you're right Quan
04also you're spoiling NOBODY ELSE LOOK AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
04btw
04she was very close to the portal
04So heat could have spilled out from the room
04along with the rushing air :P
7Uh, what's 220 K in F?
04I wonder if Wheatley and 1,1the defective SPACE core1,1 are made of gold titanium plating
7(Temperature)
04or else they'd ice
04wait fail
04umm
04-63.67 F
04o.o
7Ah.
7Chilly.
Nice
04very
7The max temperature, according to the kiwi, of the moon, is 390 K.
04Suprised there was no tornado :P
7Which translates to...
04242
04o-o
04242 F
7O.o
Even better, she would have to deal with 1,1 deadly solar radiation/wind
7Okay, so that's actually plausible.
Hot
04one extreme to another
I love this
7If the moon's temperature was between that.
"We haven't entirely nailed down what element it is yet, but I'll tell you this: it's a lively one and it does not like the human skeleton."
04She's just lucky |D
She should be fine, for around a second :O
04.
;P
Too lucky
04good job
04GOOD JOB QUAN
LOOOOOL
FAIL
04NOT PUTTING UP SPOILER TAGS

Everyone, spam

And away
Fine, just keep
04that'd be retarded
7Eh, spoilers in IRC?
Splitting lines until it goes away :P
Yes, Quan, you made that happen
7No, I mean--ah, whatev's.
Like..?
Ah, lawls

Only with SSL
Since SSL is 1337
SSL is awesome though
if drf asks universehosting I can recompile his server to work with IPv6
he needs an IPv6 IP though
IPv6 is a pain for me
Evil provider doesn't seem to have any connections for it
you need to tunnel through he.net
well
tunnelbroker.net
same thing
or another IPv6 tunnel
Okay O.o
windows also need something installed to add support iirc
not sure about win7
Win 7 has it
My laptop supports it, even on XP
Ah
well
you need to tunnel through tunnelbroker.net
make an account
create a regular tunnel
and derp derp derp
even create a rDNS
So it converts/gives you a IPv6 address through your IPv4 connection for you O.o

If there is anything there
not too bad :)
Were you ban evading on PS the other day?
yea :/
not really
well
lmao
that was quite funny
for some reason
Redirect the botnets to there if you can
Rolo nailed all my bnc ips

ironically
I figured he woulda got it first

so I have one last IP I can connect through
Any reason why Australian?
heh, I don't really care derp
nor do I
Inb4 Something expected

I don't care enough to watch it die

It sucks that bnc vhosts all have successive ip addresses
hasn't changed since I got there
hah
Horrible joke x.x
makes glining them easy
:/
I haven't tested BOPM yet
so if we get nailed again
can't guarantee it'll stop them
but I suppose the original purpose of bncs was not for gline evasion hah
Any reason or source of the attacks?
(Doubt you can install DEFCON on Island)
defcon is on services
kinda not needed as there's BOPM
Oh good
Not like it ever needs to be used XD
defcon is slightly pointless
I only use it because I cbf to check every channel to see where the bots are attacking
xD
XD
SO you cut off all connections instead
Bad girl
I only used defcon 3
which sets +R on every channel lol
Flame > Island > Shadow > Ocean
:P
He was on
like
half an hour ago
ah
does he get on daily?
used to
or just randomly
I see
now, not so much
it kinda turned into mine
but yeah I do

Tons of fun stuff
04ah
You just can't see it, the channel doesn't allow it :(

Should I give this idiot
a bouncer from HoR's service?
I'm trying to decide
04a bouncer?
yeah
basically it "bounces" your connection
the bouncer connects to the server
04oh
04Well
04why call him an idiot?
and you connect to the bouncer
and basically, when you disconnect, the bouncer stays online for as long as the bouncer server is online
and can also replay logs to you
well
he literally has no intelligence
04Then...why bother?
04well
04if it's just a lack of knowledge
04then sure I guess
04At first I meant he was a dickhead but
04I thought you meant*
he's not exactly a dickhead
but he's an idiot
like
really really really an idiot
04Like me?
no
oh well
figured it out
just deleted the request so it never happened :3

Soooooo hmmmmm
Osama is dead?
huh?
turn on CNN\
o_o
Poor Osama :(
yeah, terribly misunderstood, that man
little did the world know, that he was just an unwitting pawn in a sick game that the true mastermind, his crazy beard, was playing
...What the frack? I am hearing cheering going on in the background of CNN. What have we come to?
LOL
Osama bin Laden is apparently dead.
Yay?
o.o
lies
bin laden has been killed
:o
CBC NewsWorld does not break their feed unless Important Scheiße happens. :P
So yeah
yup
everyone got their tv's on CNN?
lemme go get popcorn
R.I.P. Osama Bin Ladin, Hide and Seek World Champion, 2001-2011
... is now my status on FB
actually
XD
lemme know when the stream starts :3
I think he has had that title since 1993 or 91, whenever he tried blowing up the trade center
That was in 2001
no
he made a pass before that
At least people are liking my status now :3
ALso, Obama be talkin'.
03lolosama
Lies and slander
This moment is not awesome enough.
Therefore: http://youtu.be/Fo48YpNOesQ
Oh wait
Heh
News outlets are reporting it all over
I bet my mom that Osama would be found and he'd be in Pakistan
Truth and veritas then

Cool, even Stephen Harper is gonna make a comment.
Hehe, Harper gonna need to make some very delicate statements now. :P
(Our election is tomorrow.)

(If he says the wrong thing... well shall we say MASSIVE ELECTION FAILURE can occur.)
damn camper
finally b&
Namely...
and gnite
If says something that translates to "I killed Osama! Vote Conservative!" good chance that on Tuesday Harper is informed his party now has less seats then the Bloc. :P
i just woke my mom up to tell her Osama is dead
Kitten: Hey, MOM! WAKE UP! A MAN IS DEAD!
Kitten's mom: ...k
no no no all wrong
/me runs through the living room and kitchen and throws open her mom's door and says "we killed him!"
Mom "...huh?"
Kitten: Our troops we killed him!!!
Mom: "killed who?"
Kitten: "Osama Bin Laden mom, we killed him!"
Mom: "uh huh, cool"
Kitten: Did you see my status on Facebook?
/me predicted that we'd kill him this year and that he'd be in Pakistan
Kitten: "Gods mom what a kill joy"
madness

How are all you excellent people who are easily susceptible to flattery?

/me slaps Holmes
MY ASS
j/k yall.
no
I'm just a silly weirdo don't mind me
Hmmmm
ah, but the Odd ones we love the most
Kitten does not approve
it is the "normal" people we dislike
well I should really do something about this then
Since I'm on the internet and thus can easily change my identity at the drop of a hat
/me nods
/me saves holmes whois info
damn you all
your laziness will be your undoing
:O
But not Kitten D:
/me shields Kitten
/me states that Kitten is tough
don't worry. I have three computers. I could be EVERYONE
also, everyone, I have an announcement to make
I <3 being the boogeyman
Hummingbirds are really strange
it's true
they're spazzes
not just that, they have wicked crazy endurance
show me any other warm blooded creature that can move it's limbs a billion times a minute
and not die of exauhstion
yeah that's what I means
/me wonders if she's normal or odd..
Kitten
I don't know you but you're probably somewhere in between
how mean!
Kitten is the strangest ever!
:o
but...but
zero normal is probably fatal
just saying
o I get it
/me hugs Kitten
you are the ultimate epitome of strange and thus the basis for how strange is determined!
noooooooooooooooooo
Kitten is wonderful in every way >:|
strange =/= bad
Yes, but
normal is usually terrible
I strongly suspect that Hex is here as Holmes
let me tell you something right now
/me giggles
If you're describing Kitten, and your description doesn't include that Kitten is wonderful, then your description of her is wrong
see!
If it makes me seem more awesome I will be this hex
as far as you know
bwahahaha
omg i just stretched my tongue to the point it hurt.. and i have no idea what i did to stretch it to hurt and i cant get it to repeat
did you happen to lick any frozen telephone poles.
might do it
Maybe you did it quickly
nope my tongue was in my mouth the entire time..
huh.
maybe just a bite you didn't really notice
by the way /honestmode I'm not whoever Hex is. honestmode/
wow apparently they got bin laden

is what it was, minus altered brackets
I just did
you know just put ****** where the apparant bad word was
It was "<censored>"
LOL
wouldn't be <herp> to have sex right?
how was ctr not kicked
typing censored in a box like that would have kicked you XD
yeha its <censored> that was censored o0
nick, "wouldn't be [censored] to have sex right?"
You're lucky there
I didnt type censored
I posted it as it was o0
That way of typing usually returns a kick
lol
but bleh we
o.o
so what was the word?
<censored> apparantley
......
o.o
usually, when someone asks that, you'd break it up with a hyphen or space
06gay was censored, it can't be anything else as that was what got censored =P
Why doesn't it kick all of us?
yeah but that time I was killed for saying it once
it gave me a count that time
only if you assume the word <censored> was used there, which it quite obviously wasn't
That is why
HAHA
i g2g in a bit
lololol
and lmfao
ahw.....

Log1x: I'm thinking about upgrading to level 8 runes
his ghost is still around though http://twitter.com/#!/GhostOsama
:O
are level 9 the highest?
13 is the highest
Lul
o
He's gonna trolololol us
I've never seen anyone with a rune higher than 9 though
cashshop galore for 13 or?
actually reading the comments to his posts he's being trollol'd
what do the crystal chips do? im assuming its related to runes
I heard an estimate that level 13 runes would cost $2,000 each
i think its in the rune section on the CS
thats pretty insane
They help you make runes
i never played it but i knew Rappelz if you wanted to be viable end game and in pvp .. like TRUELY viable it was like $20k lol
maybe more
I have level 7's on Miriamel and Kalavar

Obama should put the Osama bin laden raid on a dvd, and sell copies of it
LOL
04hi again o-o
Heya Chime
xD
I'm surprised they disposed of the body without revealing pictures of it
03waking up with a stomacheache is never fun x.x
03FOX is a TV station. That's local news.
03"FOX News" is an entirely different station
03that picture is just a local news
hard time believing pictures won't be revealed at some point in time
and im sure hollywood is going to blow up in the next 3 months with osama-related projects
Fox will always be Fox to me
03it's just not the same thing
03our local FOX station is actually really good
03and I kinda get annoyed when people mistake that for THE "Fox News"
but really if they sold dvds of the raid they could reduce the deficit :P
My grandpa just seriosly emailed me a pdf made by his scanner after he printed out his word document and rescanned it to pdf to send me.

hi
I see the good old spyroforum where everyone argues all day all the time is back :P
hah, yep
Oh btw just so you know
TTE and this other guy are doing some major stuff with the wiki
Wasn't TTE that guy who shut down SFA?
yeah
im also trying to get acces to sfa from him
access*
and bring it back up
if possible.
hm, wasn't it just a proboards forum though?
yeah
but it was popular
it also looks like darkspyro died down a bit.
But he died. He has virgins.
But they are all unwilling.....
LOL
4:D
I went back there for a while
it pissed me off
too many teenagers who think trolling makes them cool
I actually dont care too much about my old spyro stuff anymore.. just came back to have a checkup on things.
what is spyro?
yeah
:OO
Iv played that
just didnt know what it was called
i think hes trouble.
why?
I don't think I've ever seen him/her post
hes posting bin laden gore pictures in profiles
i sent him a warning
o.O
Okay...
if he does it again and you notice just get rid of him.
sure
4http://www.spyroforum.com/post-345607.html#345607 scroll up a bit
lol, I don't blame you
he was already permabanned once and someone unbanned him.... I think it was RDX
4go on last page for proof
I might as well just ban everyone.
:P
Maybe for next april fools.
or ill put up the fake "domain seized my fbi" thing.
XD
update. I have the board now
looks undamaged too
come to think of it, I can't think of a single person on that forum that I actually like
so anyways what have you been up to
so I'll be getting to work
homework, homework, and more homework

no comment
you're already better than me.
i didn't write any of the bluetooth stuff though
just used the samples library
I made a half assed music search thing
that streams any song you type the name of
its really ugly and hacky.
!Shipping
:3
...and now i cant find the apk
did you get an android phone?
no
still can't afford one
Ive got an extra htc dream here
but its too slow, you wouldnt want it
I wouldn't want it because it would cost me every month for the data plan
otherwise I'd take it
I'm finally getting my dad's old car this summer and it's already going to be a stretch to pay for the gas and insurance and everything
heya SS
ah alright.
I took my drivers test
and failed.
ah, I failed my first one too
Actually I only just passed last summer
and had to pay an extra fee for being over 18
what did you do to fail the first time
Um
Hi
Ran a stop sign, almost hit someone coming out of a parallel park...
I sped through a park zone
basically I just got really nervous and screwed up everything
probably happens to 90% of people.
How long are your tests?
the whole thing probably takes about half an hour
same here.
they just make you take a bunch of turns, 90 degree park, parallel park, and then you're done
I also got "points" because i dont move my head enough
ah yeah
when im "scanning" intersections
they probably thought you weren't looking in the mirrors
yeah
I dont actually use my mirrors that often so they'd be right :P
lol, that's a problem then :P
I mean, I can probably drive fine
if there wasnt some guy looking at me the whole time
yeah
especially a tight ass british guy.
12Hello Nick :3
who calls me by my full name
lol
and preappends my name to everything he says
heya GL
I had the same guy both times
he remembered me from the first time and he remembered my brother and asked if I was related to him
didyour brother pass the first time?
I was like "you must test hundreds of people, how did you remember me from a year ago?"
I think so
I should just go up country to northern bc to a city with a population of 100 and do the test
he got it right when he turned 16
Lul!
no swearing!
xD
How is Lul swearing :P
Id probably get some drunk native instructor
I could give him a case of beer in exchange for passing me.
lul is dutch for d*ck
oh well i figure ill pass it eventually
i havent taken my second test anyways
it's a lot easier when you know what to expect
yeah
12lol I did hear about how other languages have swear words too
heh, is pretty funny to try explaining that to others, who don't know it of course :P

02Fine~
Ohai Manly
Yo, HML.
02We need to play brawl
02I haven't played in a month or so D:
Same here, actually. xD
Haven't played Tri in a month, either.
02xD
02I haven't had the time to play MHT :(
Dang.
How high did you manage to get your HR?
02Low, just leave it at that xD
It can't be that low...right? lmfao
02Yes, it can. XD
02hey manly, how about some brawl. not today, but this weekend? :3
Sounds good.
It'll have to be on either Saturday or Sunday afternoon, because I'm gone all of Friday.
02hmm...
02Saturday sounds fine
Awesome. xD
02I wonder if I can still land a Knee of Justice, since I haven't played in forever xD
I'm fine as long as my Charizard isn't slow as hell. Maybe I should play it right now so I wouldn't suck later, haha.
/me smiles
02XD
/me smiles too, but does not know why
02Come on, don't play till' this saturday
and wow, I think I had too much wine
but it was only like a glass and a half
I can't hold you that promise. I don't like sucking. xD
02in a month or more
Rust is a myth, anyways. lol

02I have a bad feeling...
02I know that Craig will rape us all (or at least me) in half sec

As long as we're not all strewn over the planet with little lag, there will be no raping by any players, only from the lag. xD
And last I checked, we're all strewn over the planet. lmfao
02xDDD
02Lag, the final boss of every multiplayer game
Haha!
I'm so playing Brawl now. xD
02I saw that one comming

If only the CPUs didn't suck so bad.
02^
02Lv 9s are impossible
02Nothing else to add

Well, I have no trouble with Lvl. 9s. There comes a certain point in a Smasher's life where beating a computer feels like a chore, and I hate taking out the garbage.
Now having three of them fight against you in a team; that's a different story. xD

Yes, I do not have it.

And wow, watching these two CPUs fight is like watching two people barely playing Brawl for the first time.
02xD
Edge-guarding, spamming smashes, spamming rolls, and blocking for eternity.
And they miss every time. . -.
02yep, just like everyone when first played xD

04actually brb
I dont think you guys care about our elections anyways
we have had like 3-4 elections in the past 6 years
if i remember right.
Well, I know no one in our national media is going to care
I just care because I plan on moving up there one day
The canadian conservatives are more liberal than your republicans
lol?
Thank god
/me now belongs to Umbreon for 13 minutes
/me plays TtFaF on extreme loudness, sets the area on fire, blasts Umbreon to bits and laughs maniacally~
Why would you do that D:
I bet your conservatives are more liberal than our liberals
hahaha no
12curiousity is quite a powerful muse
our NDP is like your democrats
oh lawl
haha
the canadian conservatives are really conservative when it comes to the economy
and a bit liberal for social services and stuff like that
:3
;p
I missed out voting by a few months
almost 18 :P
;p
no
12don't make me play hardball D:

At the moment, at least.
!espeon
:3
D;
Espeon forgot to set to away
12lol
Im happy we got rid of the sepratist party though
they are lucky to get one seat now.
Oh HELL no
Not yet
!umbreon
For realz
xD
12lol
stephen harper isnt very photogenic
Based solely on personality, I'd pick Palin before Trump.
what I dislike about the political system in canada is how the seats are distributed
I have no idea what the two would entail otherwise.
I just know we're screwed if either one ends up anywhere near office.
we need a representation by population distribution os seats
of*
12now will you take the line back

12i've heard of that myth
Yeah well. That isn't happening. :P
Nope xD
Is it true :V
12has it ever been proven beyond a benefit of a doubt
I know this is old news, but it's bugging me again
http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-01-prop_n.htm
Idk
They're such freakin' babies about Prop 8.
Has it been proven false? :P
Because if it did, he'd be able to figure out how to travel past the speed of light and colonize other galaxies
I never liked it to begin with. lol
Lul
K
12i used to like it
12i'm more rootbeer though
code red mountain dew is awesome though D:
Hmmm
Sierra Mist is where it's at. xD
I'm more of a sprite person myself anyway
same thing :P
Wouldn't a Catholic judge still have to hear a case about abortion?
sierra mist IS awesome though
Nobody would complain about that.
12water is truely awesome
12it's how they did it many years ago
evening.
Hey
but
I still prefer milk over anything, though.
Just because a person is straight, doesn't mean they won't have a bias either.
Everyone has a bias.
But I'm just cranky. >.>
The legal standard is written more like whether someone could be percieved to have biases towards a case
Where someone's "impartiality might be questioned" I think is the legal phrasing of it
But
I guess that's what appeals are for
so, if a straight judge turned down turned down prop 8 would they yell about bias?
No.
He's straight!
So it's okay
yeah, so that's retarded
I'm just angry about politics at the moment, Ari. So don't mind me. :P
:3
/me goes back to lurking
It annoys me that religious people get so angry about gay marriage
/me hugs Curly
/me hugs
Marriage isn't strictly a religious thing.
The thing is with that kind of stuff, you have to decide whether the judge has a PREFORMED opinion
that's the main thing.
Yeah
Ideally all judges haven't even heard of the case before it goes to trial
b/c then they're totally impartial
So like
Portal 2 came out
And it dominated.
I kinda jumped in.
Now we just need to stop calling Gabe Newell fat so he'll release Episode 3.
I don't know anything about the case either and why it's held to be unconstitutional
Having played it yet. . -.
Prop 8?
Yeah
I mean
I know what it is
But I don't know about the court history
Pretty sure the legal basis was something along the lines of "there's no reason to do this"
/me often disagrees with the means but agrees with the ends with cases involving constitutionality in court
as in it doesn't serve a legal purpose.
as far as I could tell
but hey let's talk about something less... controversial eh?
State laws don't have to have a legal purpose, only federal laws :3
/me growls.

03keep in mind the Blu-Ray of movie 5 is coming out in like 2 weeks :P
EWW BLUE TINT
EWW 4KIDS CUT
03we'll see
03it might be better, who knows
it's still cut
03I don't think that much was cut
to me it does not matter too much whether it was cut or not
it's not much, but it is signifigant
WOP+L
03how would you do tri-audio then? If the dub is cut...
03L?
03World of Pokémon we could just fly in from movie 8 or somesuch
03or... 7?
03the dub of 7 had it
03and the Blu-Ray is 5/7
+L=Legend bit
i uncut it, by best-matching the WOP, and recreating the speech from L
lemme dig up my TA,
I saw a "restored" cut episode
I hated it
i know which one ("james boobs")
it looked mutilated and horrible
I hate restore attempts for cuts
because most of the time they don't work
not all restores are done equal.
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=DR791EXP < drf, you can see/listen how i did it.
i made uncut for M4. drf has it.
just don't do it for Pokemon movie 5
please
03anyway
03downloading
03and I'm going to bed
the cut scenes were all narration-based, so you shouldn't be umm, upset over it.
unlike "james-boobies" one.
we will see
just make sure your edits are smooth and seamless
then it will be fine
no obvious color or source changes
the WOP-sorta can't. L i can. I did do some colour-correction tho (mb a bit strong)
the PocketMonsters restore of Beauty and the Beach was just botched badly
& a music edit at the start (MPM specialedit) & the end (you & me & pokemon)
don't restore those
or if you do put in the original unedited, undoctored English language track as a dual audio secondary track
i did hybrid/that for M12
its not much to ask
when i started encoding, i did consider that, because it's more information. but later, as i developed tastes for pokemon music, i put songs i liked instead (also, some people like j-music better)
my internet broke.

ohay LU
true
but tastes vary
plus I am something of a preservationist
even when it comes to dubs
For no reason
maybe because it was Chinese crap
cheaper Chinese electronics have a tendancy to drop dead at random after a few years or so
My router is a rWire
*2Wire
But I don't know though
plus there was a case of capacitor plague not too long ago where a bad batch of electrolytic capacitors flooded the market and numerous manufacturers were effected
I sure hope that router was WIFI or ethernet
and not...
EWW POWERLINE NETWORKING
Why EW powerline networking?
its a bad technology over all
it causes severe interference for one
How?
it uses the HF (high frequency) radio spectrum over household wiring which was not designed to carry RF and thus not shielded appropriately
the signals it uses leak out of the lines and can travel up to several hundred feet
hmmm
not to mention amateur radio operators or others operating legally on the HF spectrum can kill your network simply by transmitting
if they are at close range

"1 failed login since last login"
who did it
:P
/me is blasted into ash
Lol.
lmao you will be getting views in the thousands in a few weeks
:D
ALTAIR.
wtf
what
rydrtydtttytdky''
also
SNEAS

Altair you started up a second instance of ZNC
http://mshiltonj.com/software_wars/current/
then you closed it
xD
epic
/me runs
Yeah I know
I fixed the old server
o_O?
What old server Altair?
derp
The server that lost a LAN card
I redid it
o-o
As in, replaced like everything in it
oh the old computer the server used to be on?
ah
Also
with ZNC
Going to do some replacing on the server I have, it's a micro ATX
I think you have to compile it in "release" mode
instead of "debug" mode
in Visual Shit
Meh
:P
Studio*
I'm too lazy to redo it, it's not taking more memory
You know the weird thing though Altair
since we replaced the software
we've been pinging from localhost and shit
dunno why
Kason!
I'm damn sure there's nothing wrong with my code
/me flops
ohai Quilava
hi.
:3
Anyway, bbl
probably back in like
Wat
20 minutes
Ok
I'll be taking the server down a bit later
the BNC has been pinging from the localhost server
Why? o.O
I need to replace parts from this one into the old one
I could try doing it on but it would either derp out or shock me
.______.
wait so what's happening?
you're moving the server elsewhere or something?
Nope, I'm moving parts from the one I have currently to the old one
ah...?
Well make sure you !global or something
derp
Oh crap
brb
well seeya

Lolol
03wait
03what
if Im...unpleasant on XBL...
03oh
03:(
The chat has be dead for 1hr
03LOL
03well
What happened :o
*suprised
03my connection died so I rebooted
03and sigh
Aha XD
03that second computer I build
03*built
03I exchanged the motherboard
03bought a video card
Laptop?
03then someone tells m
03e
03the video card I got sucks
03so I need to reurn it...
03and I bought a better one
03>_>
03and nope, desktop
What was it?
03now it's about a total of $300
03total
03which is really cheap for a computer
03I mean, quad core, 4GB of RAM, it's not like a crap pile either
03and... a NVIDIA 9500GT card xD
Wow XD
That's FINE
:P
03but I ordered an ATI one since it's an AMD processor >_> <_<
For someone like me that is *rouh*
03I generally don't like ATI graphics but...
Buut?
Deal with it :P
03AMD/ATI goes together better
03so I'm like w/
03e
03and really, it's a second machine anyway
03to be used solely for recording TV
03so it's not even that big a deal
03I'd use the onboard graphics if I could
Which card *pleasedogettheHD4350* :o
03but it's all "wah your grahpics aren't good enough to play HD video so we won't let you record HD either"
03um
Well the 9500 is kinda old now

03that
Not as bad as my 8300gs
Ah, not bad really
03LOL 8300
03I could send you this 9500 >_> <_<
Vishtrash PC
03I mean, it's only $30 after rebate
03It'd probably cost me more in gas just to take the stupid thing back XD
03but I have no use for it
It's my mother's PC lol XD
Yeah
Just keep it
03want me to send it to you? :P
I stole a Geforce 2MX for fun
eh, sadly, the overseas shipping
Isn't worth it
03not that bad actually
03I could prolly get away with paying less than $20
03stamps.com is just awesome like that

03VIA is the absolute worst you can have

VIA o.o
03my mom's old HP had VIA
03thing couldn't even run like

Aha, sad really
03I ended up just buying her a new PC XDF
03-F
03I love Micro Center
03for under $500 total you can get really good gaming machines
03and you all know that gaming machines when used for non-gaming are just epic ;P
Which is why my PC is in the middle :P
03my theory on computers
03get the best parts that you can
03you don't have to use its full potential but it's better to be able to than not to
It's only a PSU and GPU upgrade away from making it a nice gaming PC XD

03still
03and sadly my sister is going to have to get a Dell for college x.x
03since it's the only thing they'll do service on if it breaks
Baww, I have a Lenovo T410i (inb4 ew)
03and she's not good with computers so I want to set her up with something she can get fixed when she breaks it
03yes when, not if
03she's a girl, it's just natural :P
So true
erm
LL *is* here
03my sisters break computers like they break nails
/me flees
O.o
03and they tend to get really nasty viruses that are worse than anything I've ever seen
03and I'm all HOW THE FRICK DID YOUG ET THAT
03because they don't download stuff
03though I think giving them Ad Muncher was possibly the best decision ever
Which is why I let the rest of my family use the slow and nearly dead Vista PC :D

erm about the 1st part...
?
lol
what about it?
lol
08:53 cool
lol
oh, lol, k
lolol
its too quiet in here.
well, we just need a good topic. what interests us?
lol. vamps and zombies?
:)
k.
hmm, it is fairly straightforward when creating a Zombie plan, but I would imagin it would be a lot more difficult to create a Vamp plan
not really.
Well, vamps are intelligent, harder to kill, and excellent hunters at night
well, not when you read every vamp book that u can lay ur hands on.
:)
meaning your mobility would be restricted to the daylight hours, an even then they might be able to track you if enough of em are looking out of windows during the day
your only hope would be to get to a nice tropical island more than 200 miles from the nearest main body of land, hunt down and kill everything that is undead during the day, and restrict your living spaces to the center of the island
No fires at night, and all fires should be extinguished at least 2 hours before nightfall
/me smirks
ok, what is your plan?
i'm a writer. i can create my own species vamp.
:)
and we DONT sparkle
lol the only diff to my species in the light thing. everything else is the same.
right, meaning same mobility restrictions would apply
vamps can run fast, wheres the mobility restrictions?
also, on your island, you would want to do what the Vietcong did and make a spidey hole that leads to an underground sleeping area
the mobility restrictions I am talking about applies to human survivors
I am talking about a Vampire Survival plan
i leave no survors.
survivors*
I would survive
vamp survival plan, be a nomad - kill the prey - blend in with populations - know how to fight.
Human Survival Plan: Flee the undead, Lop off their heads when you have to fight, get away from the mainland
lopping off their heads, while it may not kill them, will most certainly hinder their ability to come after you
never did understand how a vamp can function after a bullet to the head though
I mean, they most certainly retain their intelligence, meaning their brain is still active, so any trauma to it would affect a vamp
k, gonna play some games, bbl
lol, vamps can swim.
stake thru the heart. or rip and burn.
thts the only ways i know of
right,but if you lop off their heads, they will lose most, if not all control of their body

03I just don't like when people call me fat
Then suddenly you will be thin
but the Digimon creators sure didn't have much creativity either.
03it's like how retarded people hate when people call them retarded

03no
03ownership scripts are just annoying >_>
...
04hi
Hi
I thought this was the sillychannel?
03it is, but going !everyone just looks stupid
03especially when people know darn well most people don't ahve those scripts.
drf, loosen up
I don't see the problem
half of what's said here is just as interesting as the !<name> lines anyway.
03that's a matter of opinion
as is your statement.
03I know
03I never said it wasn;t
03see, was that really necessary?
also, who didn't have them?
03everyone but those 4?
This isn't a serious chat you know
Loosen up
You can set up #serious if you want to
03I don't mind sillyness now and then but you also abuse scripts quite a lot
03like when you do !pokemon 28 times in a row until you get one of only four(!) that youw ant
...
I thought TST was a laid-back and for-fun thing, not a srsbsns thing.
You know me as the script abuser
Everyone knows that
nofunallowed.jpg
kby
03well
03it's also the fact that by doing !name, you're triggering any potential nick alerts that people have set up and I don't think people appreciate when you do that when they intentionally don't have a script for that reason
But then without doing that I won't ever know who has or got a script
Like !leafeon
03yeah but you do it all the time
Though I understand the annoying part
03it's like those people who type !espeon without even checking if Espeon is on the channel
03it just makes them look like an idiot
i really don't care about nickalerts
no sounds, i only find out when i check mIRC
03neither do I, but some people do
Sigh drf, ever since you took over the chat this place now feels too strict
03I have them completely disabled. I think they're stupid.
/me cares slightly, but goes by the philosophy of 'rather one too many than one too few'.
meh
when i'm actually on mIRC and someone is trying to get my attention i find it helpful
03I never took over the chat
but i idle in 3 or 4 different networks usually
03I'm only ever on two networks, and only two truly active channels
03so I have a 50/50% chance of seeing it anyway :P
06opinions everywhere
06and now I vanish again
hade Espeon
k
03hade?
04hi
I'm on five different servers
One is pretty serious
A desktop skinning commuinity
And I know never to do such things there because people will get annoyed
But here? Meh
03and seriously, if you think I'm bad, you should try #RawkSD
03they banned me because they hate me
I thought we are more relaxed about such stuff
03I hate elitist circlejerk groups
!list
03I get as annoyed with you trying to nick-trigger everyone on the channel as people do with me saying EW APPLE all the time./
...
Throw in your hate of 5th gen
03same idea.
The only justified one so far was the Black City/White Forest thing
then that off-topic here
*that's
03not really
Either way
People do annoying stuff here from time to time
03I know
As long as it's not all the time, people tolerate it
I don't spam all the time
Notice how much I idle?
03yes
But whenever people talk about Apple, or 5th gen Pokémon, you start ewwing
almost every time thus far as I have seen
03whenever you;'re here you start nicktriggering
03how is there a difference
03bottom line here is that people get annoyed at silly things :P
06Yes. And if one side "must just deal with it otherwise they're oversensitive" then that goes for everyone. And that's all I have to say (again) about it.
03I never said I was *offended* by it
03that's the difference with that one
06Well getting offended by any of the things brought up is rather silly, but annoyance is something that can't be annoyed. Only way to make sure no one is annoyed is to literally go #nofunallowed =P. So a balance of things, I guess.
03anyway
03I'm gonna go run a couple errands
03so bbl
06Alright~
I'm making cheese!
drf
All I can tell you at this moment is
Loosen up
And don't be annoying
People have the right to scriptspam a bit
Talk about Apple stuff
and 5th gen Pokémon
As long as it's not something like

Something like that
06See, as long as people don't a) do it when there's some kind of conversation or b) pull a "My opinion is x, if you disagree you're g6ay"
06then it should be okay :B
Or when it's in the middle of someone's chat or something
Just learn to accept it
This != seriouschat
Espeon: even better if the person accused /is/ gay - what insult would it be then? :P
:P
'You're gay!' 'Yeah, your problem?'
oh
06I know Lakorv, I actually instantly think someone must have a small vocabulary when someone uses it as an insult, but just to make my example more realistic in a way - as a lot of people do think it's the best insult evar besides their yo momma jokes~
06Silly people
haha
you should meet my parallel class
06In fact, just saying "Yes, I'm g6ay" quite often leads to hilarious results...
06And oh? o.o
they yell 'you're gay' and '<censored>' at eachother all the time
06Lol.
why, thanks
I see that holding an intellectual conversation is really convenient in this channel.
lol
did my line get through?
06Yeah xD
okay
well, the point is they don't consider it demeaning
06Some kind of joke or something? o.o
their default reply is 'And I like it!'
06Ahaha
and by statistics, at least 60-90% of that class should be straight
:P
I asked my friend it the class to describe their class in one word
'homophile?'
I never heard of that
I heard of homophobe
oh
but not that
06lolnorwegian
it's synonymous with 'homosexual'
07LOL
07Lakorv
07i adore you
except
07also
06But probably not used that much internationally I guess o.o
07fail swearing script is fail
literally, it means 'attracted to the same'
whereas 'homosexual' means 'sexually attracted to the same'
same difference.
07^^
07exist?

what now?
07I don't think timey likes me
07lol...
07I was
07told to look at something
07and I pointed out there was no imperfection with the picture itself, but that frequent typos and the like sort of distract me. He's just being a floof back to me because of it
07Didn't really liked me pointing out his writing as a flaw. >.o Oops?
07I guess he asked though...
hum
04mew
as mentioned in 138.. not all take critique constructively.
07Lol i guess....
07It just makes me not want to answer questions honestly though
07Or, at least, only tell partial truths.
his loss, I guess?
07Orrrr be as secretive as ever.
07Yah
07Well Timey can go floof in a corner.
07He asked, I answered
:>
07I just find he's full of contradictions sometimes
07I mean... he once praised me for my honesty.
07Now then, regarding this
07he doesn't like it! lol.
it's easier to be big in words than big in action.
07True.
07well that said
it's easy to say things you'd like to think are true.
07Mhm...
07well considering he has reminded me of an older version of the peregrine
07and because of a convo I had earlier today
07this does not surprise me.
07he also was like that
07said things, then contradicted them
/me is used to it though. . . .
/me does believe she gets along with most people. Or, she would. That might change.
07Once I become more confident, I don't think everyone will like me as much
07Because I simply won't adapt as much as I used to, to replicate and mirror in order to be more likeable. o3o

they were a curious band

03LOOOL @ this
03my mom and I kept hearing what sounded like a bird, right
03and my momw as like "it's too loud to be outside... it's probably trapped in our house soemwhere"
03so when I was out running errands, my mom was looking around the house
03turns out
;o
03my sister has her AIM/Skype/whatever set to make a bird tweeting sound when she gets an I<
03*IM
03and it sounds so real it fooled the both of us
Tweets XD
03I'm like LOL I can't believe that
Oh the puns x.x
03and this is why turning your speakers off when you aren't at the computer is good
03or better yet, signing out of IM when you aren't on o.o
Wow
lol
lol
03I know right
Thank you ari :)
I can't believe she would do such s thing
Take her phone and add you saying "EW BIRDS" to it
Now you can legally by cigarettes :D
03I never said EW BIRDS
03I have no problems with the
03m
03I'
this is why you don't use environmental sounds for notifications.
Until now
:P
03I'm just not a fanatic like some people here
And you're at the age of consent in every state in the U.S.
lol yeah, ik. my friend was trying to get me to smoke with her
03LOL, I don't use *any* sounds for IM programs
03it's really obnoxious
And
lol
07o3o
07and
I'm not sure what else
sisi
03to hear stupid binging noises every 2 seconds
07then there were
XD
07peadges
03especially since my sister is a social magnet
sounds are fine for the uses they suit.
03with like 800 friends on AIM
You can sign contracts
/me is chewed on
03you have any idea how annoying that is?
I, personally, don't use them.
yay contracts
03hearing those noises that often?
07Haha
I use visual feedback and popups.
07I like IM sounds
07but
07they can get insane
07because whenever I sign on somewhere
03I literally don't use anything
03if I get an IM, the IM window opens, that's all
07I get like 3+ people IMing me within the minute
07o3o
07so it's like
07aaah sounds
03with MSN it makes the taskbar icon flash colors
07nbut
07If I dont have them
07I dont notice anyone
07=p
07so its like
03the window doesn't pop up?
07sounds = response
07nou
03o.o
03that's... odd
ya?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
/me floofs on Lakorv
there's no 'popping up' for my irc either
lol, thank you (:
03I never said IRC
03I said instant messaging
03I don't consider IRC to be IM, it's a chatroom protocol :P
:D
/me dies
you're trying to sound smart
D:
03so you're saying I'm not?
03D:"
but you ruined it with the word 'chatroom protocol'
07o3o...
/me chews on irc.
03but IRC *is* a chatroom protocol, is it not?
03I'm just stating facts :P
the hell is a chatroom
:D
no
03IRC channels are chatrooms
irc is not a room
03orly
you're talking about channels
03then why is there an iPhone (EW) app for chatting on IRC called Rooms? :OP
03*:P
furthermore, it's not a channel protocol
it's a relayed text-over-ip protocol
03which, in layman's terms, is chat
yes
relayed chat.
lol
03hence the name.
nawp
the room part has no home in the protocol definition.
WHY NOT??
07yeh but ... it's not technically a room then
07o_O
there is no such thing as a 'chatroom protocol'
03well
!define chatroom
-!- chat room: a site on the internet where a number of users can communicate in real time (typically one dedicated to a particular topic)
03is that not what IRC is?
cuz hubby dont want me to
D:
03minus the word site
07a site on the internet o3o
03that's kinda a stupid definition
03get rid of "a site"
03other than that, is that not what IRC is? :P
that i could move out
lol
:Oo
chat room: a room wherein people talk together.
Something that I can do
03more or less, which is what IRC is
03I realize it can be used for other things too
Zac Efron = Romeo? </random>
popular contemporary usage contains strong conotations to digitalism.
XD
03but it's PRIMARILY used for chatting
07No because irc isn't a 'room' per se o_O
03EW ZAC EFRON
I know XD
03well channels = rooms
no.
07No.
07... LOL
Yes
07I was one second too late.
07fjfs
03you're arguing with a native English speaker here :P
Yeah ;o
03you probably just have a different term for it
03in Norwegian
03or something
07o_O
I've had a native English speaker tell me
Haha
that English came from Latin
03English is just a weird language
now that must surely be correct since she was native?
03it came from everywhere
nor did it do that.
03orly
07DRF
03English words come from just about every language
07you're not using your words precisely.
07so
07moot arguments really.
sala de chat is better :P
07o_O
umz
idk
07Spanish.
gimme a sec
English develloped on the basis of the Germanic Anglo-Saxian language
later it was influenced by the French
03yes but there are words in English that come from many languages
03like almost everything out there
also, Norsemen.
Like Tacos *nod*
07So the above-mentioned -> everywhere?
07o_O
03LOL
03I meant more like "llama"
03the animal
damnit
03which also comes from Spanish
03:P
cool whip is gone
07insofar I know
have to come up with a new idea
07those areas
07arent everywhere
03Lakorv, more like the reverse
03English stems from every language
03more or less
03it may be developed off one or another but in today's day and age, words in the ENglish language come from everything
<...<
file:///C:/Users/Breizy44/Downloads/Photo1715.jpg
by your definition
every language which includes an English word
would stem from English.
07o3o...
:o
/me thinks paradox
03You sure enjoy picking my sentences apart, don't you
/me curls up next to Lakorv
I can't see it, that file is on your computer
English in itself came from Anglo-Saxian, French and Norse.
07your imprecise language allows such to happen.
07and
Remember that girl on my friends list you were creeping on?
aaaw pooo
03LOL imprecise
07Indeedu
Yes I remember her :3
the vocab has however been expanded by means of words from many other languages.
... I think
I creeped on a bunch of htem
07because it's such a loosely structured sentence/content.
her name is katy
07and hmn
03didn't we just have a discussion earlier about how this channel isn't meant to be very serious?
07o3o
03so of course I'm not going to go around talking like I';m a dictionary
07lol, well so why
07are you complaining?
07^--
07this
03I never said yelling or accusing
I think so
03o_O
03I said picking my sentences apart
The one looking for a fwb?
so where is the problem?
unless you install apache or something..
03did I say it was a problem?
/me likes where this conversation is headed
07it does have some negative connotations.
07o3o
07when you
o.O u know i know nothing of compies
07said it like this.
there?
lol no
she just made something and then let me have it and it is awesomeness
03I never said yelling or accusing in that sentence either.
no, so where is the problem?
03I never said I had ap roblem
03+space -space
got a thing against intellectual arguments?
03nope
!space
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!!!
.x.
07LOL
03so that's a start
Yep XD
07well
lolll
07i'll just put you on ignore for reals this time
07stop pointing it out
03o.o why
XD
blah
07you make me really want to
;<
Who
07because you're making a big deal out of it!
When you get a linux server
Actually I probably didn't even know you could get that path name from anywhere...
or a linux comp, everything changes.
Ah, you
03well
07o3o
07hi
There ari, i sent it to ya.
03meh I don't feel like explaining it on here.
So my friend accidentally sent me an album of her nekkid pics
lolz
"How do I get this picture online?" "You upload it." "...What?"
bet it wasnt an accident
03let's just say with all the crap I've had go on in my life, having one less person ignore me is a major accomplishment, which is why I'm making a big deal out of it/ o.o
No it wasn't
I mean
07then don't. But just stop making somekind of deal out of it really..
07well
xP
They were all online anyway
07I have made my stance clear.
well, you've been making quite a deal out of it when she /was/ ignoring you, too.
:O
03yes I know Lakorv, we've all done things we aren't proud of, let's let the past be past, k?
03I just like when you actually reply to me, rather than acting like I don't exist.
Then I would save the image in .bmp format and wonder why the upload wouldn't work. XD
Yeah, haha
03xD, I'm having a discussion about the ending of Portal 2 in another channel
:P
this is when I was like 14
On my first forum
:P
LOL
seeing as how it was pointed out to you, and you'd still make a point out of it, I'd put your regret to question, but I don't feel like keeping this going.
...I didn't even start using the internet until 14, OK? :P
How old are you now
?
20
Oh
Hmm
girl or guy?
girl
jooh old
:P
07I just think you're rather unpleasant. Either way you're being mean, me acknowledging you or not.
yeah I know lol
07Until you get your way. The difference is ... strikingly little.
07Anyway
xD
/me is going to stay 18 forever
07I don't feel like carrying this discussion any further, either
03I fail to see how I'm being mean but I don't need to go into it.
07I's going to do other things
03since you clearly don't want to
07Why should I want to?
Wait no
:P
she just turned 24
waawwt
:P
03I dunno
*_* oh to be 24
03people are strange
07There ya go.
03and I don't just mean the song title
/me meeps
When I turn 21 I'm going to stay 21 forever
07Heya
07^-^
i mean... ya, i am totally 24 >...>
07How are you?
:O
zomg
oh man, i missed so much.
03ugh
03why is this KVM switch not working as it should
What do you mean?
not really
because it's KVM.
yes huh
:OO
I am a little tiered, been studying for most of the day for my last final exam that I have tomorrow.
03LOL
have fun.
I am still talking to you from 1 hour in the future
03what would you suggest instead then
How are you today?
:O
03having two computers using one set of keyboard/mouse
07I'm icky
03and monitor
07but
07happy
heeey.... do they have chipotlez in the future?
07^v^
I feel like i missed a lot too sometimes
/me excess floofs on Lakorv
03I mean, luckily the second computer is just a machine I built for like $200 to record TV onto
03but I still need to be able to control it
have fun.
07I define physically being okay as different from being emotionally okay XD
like I said
they do, but it is now considered healthfood
03Lakorv, how do you change between computers then
03if you aren't using a siwtch
noice
03o.o
03is that like VNC?
no.
07thanks!
23:20:39 Lakorv: have fun.
07Lol Lakorv.....
03hey, I was just asking for help, but whatever
/me cuddles the raven happily
haha
oh, you were?
03yes
03I'm curious how you can do it without using a KVM switch
sorry, I didn't see any question for help there.
what do you use it for, just uploading stuff?
seedbox
03I forgot to type a ?
web server
irc server
Ah
no
IRC client
(What's a seedbox?)
you asked 'how' and 'is it like'
I answered both.
03um OK
07=P
03but the pasting the "have fun" comment made it clear you didn't want to help me
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedbox
03anywho I'm guessing it's not possible to do that using Windows?
of course it is.
03hm
Oh, OK
Yeah
networking is kind of cross-platform.
03I mean, I can use TeamViewer to control the other computer but that seems silly when it's right next to me
blarg
03I've got two monitors, both hooked up to my primary desktop. The KVM switch controls the right monitor (which is VGA) so I can use it with the second one, but then that locks me out of using the other
03since it unplugs the mouse/keyboard from the other machine x.x
/me squishes Lakorv
I should work on my android app, but I reaaaaly don't want to
07silly floofs
me h
:O
07^-^
totes my word
what, blarg?
06oo
07Espeon!!!!!!!!!
07!espeon
03Windows Update is so stupid at times
Played through bluetooth
/me is off to bed
Gnite all
03I wish I could just be like "Install all over 9000 updates right now and stop bugging me"
07bai
03I'll install like 50 updates, then right after I reboot, more updates found
03it's like grr
oh
thats cool
03XD
lol
I dont have an android phone
it would be if I could get it working right >.<
03Ordinarily the updates are fine
Me either
what phone do you have?
*blargh* rather
03but when you build a new machine and install Windows 7 off a disc that's now over a year old, well... there's craptons of updates
oh
03and it just gets annoying to get it current
my phone is a boring Kin TwoM
I downloaded 600 MB of updates for my desktop today.
I say "boring" because I can't use the wifi
expanded, it made for 2.5 GB.
03for what, Windows?
nope
/me glares at the school network
full system update for Arch Linux.
03o.o
xD
03never heard of that distro
why not :o?
too bad.
it makes you register everything
03I usually just use Ubuntu if I need to use Linux for something
03like formatting hard drives
03because Windows sucks at that
Oh D:
So regi it
and it thinks my phone is an actual computer because the browser on it is Internet Explorer
07i have a question
Ohh
I got it
03?
07are you delicious?
07o3o
clone your comp mac address to your phone
And to register a computer you have to download the "security agent" and McAfee
03depends on if you like the food I just ate
/me flails - that question randomly came up in a game she played once.
:o how do you do that?
random question.
hmmm
07lol i know, right?
07i had fun asking people that
07:p
03I seriously cannot stop looping this
Or
you can do something a lot easier
07lol yeh....
07it was an ogre
07and
What OS do you have on yer comp?
07it asked that.
06Yes

So you cant do a wireless tether
/me is randomly going throuh old music
07Yeps I do
03I remember when we were both obsessed with that song
but you might be able to do tether to your phone through wifi
Rise and shine, Mister Freeman; rise and shine!
07i think it was him anyway.
03I think I did
through USB
03he and I were both obsessed with it
03and we made you obsessed XD
like
03I would if he were around
03I should over to his house and poke him
07lol he's on IM enough.
03he is but I never attempt to talk to him since he never replies
07I see him frequently
07and Lakorv
07peadgeface
03he hasn't ever since ... we met like 7 years ago ><_>
03*>_>
07he replies to me.
03heh
03sometimes he does, but usually he just doesn't
there is an app
03and he'll be like "oh, I was too busy"
ots called PDAnet
07m'kies.
03we saw Tron Legacy together back in December though
You download it for yer comp
and for yer phone
it should work
it works for min e
I loved that app till the trial ended
xD
I may actually buy it
TPB ftw
hmm
I don't think I can install apps to this phone
Oh
D:
You download it through your comp
if it has to be on both the computer and the phone, it won't work
d:
D: *
You could buy a cheap router
like $20-30
I wish; the school doesn't allow them though
No
like
plug it into your comp
03http://themetapicture.com/the-hardest-part-of-any-game/
and then you can do an internetshare
You can't use a personal router
from your comp to the router
D:
Not allowed
whay not?
No idea
thats just..

/me stabs Ceton InfiniTV to isntall faster
03it's like a 20KB program. Why does it take 5 minutes to install >_>
it needs that time to litter your registry sufficiently.
03XD
03it's just drivers
03InfiniTV is a TV tuner by Ceton corp
03that cost me like $600 x.x
exactly?
03but Windows doesn't know what to do with it unless I install their drivers
03and the drivers take forever

>playing portal on console
> 4chan quoting lacking initial space
>wat
03Dialga, I play Portal on console.
>olivetext
and
03I have POrtal 2 for both PC and Xbox 360... only played the full game on Xbox
i'm still pointing it out
03played co-op on PC, but I want to play co-op with LL when she's done with it
as in why
03(yay achievement farming?)
03XD
03I just hate using the keyboard and mouse for games... when I DO use PC games, I use my wired Xbox 360 controller
i don't have portal 2 and i don't particularly plan on getting it because i already know the entire plot and stuff
i can't stand using controllers lopl
wasd + mouse
07^--
at least, i know everything there is to know about it because everyone's going batscheiße crazy about it
03I hate using WASD
03if I have to use the keyboard, I remap it to use the arrow keys
03also wtf Windows
>arrow keys
what
03it's saying the Ethernet controller is unrecognized hardware
03it came with the fricking motherboard, wtf
how do you jump
03shift?
03depends on the game, really.
03but I like using controllers
03or joysticks :D
that just seems incredibly inconvenient
03ever played Commander Keen (old DOS game)? That thing is instantly more epic using a joystick
032-button preferred
03or more
my friend has a flight stick thing with like 8 buttons
03yeah
03I have this Microsoft Sidewinder joystick
i hate using it when i go to his house
03thing cost like $100 back in 2000 xD
03now you can get them for dirt cheap
03anyway
03gonna go downstairs so I can watch some TV or something, I'll be back on my laptop
i still prefer wasd + mouse lopl
k
03well I don't :P

and oh
the driew came out of nowhere and assfucked him
we got attacked again
lmao
I didn't
ah
ah
well
I painted a field of grass that is next to some trees which are pine
we had an attack last night
that caused a netsplit
crashed Ambernova's BOPM too
:x
in the background is a mountain with clouud behind it
it was funny though
they started w/ all of the opers
then just raped channels
lmao
Legend I think was idle
for the majority of it
or something
:|
Sounds like somewhere I'd want to live, haha.
"<&HelpBot> There is currently network difficulty. It will be handled as soon as possible."

SPP and SPP-Wifi

unreal and anope are so pro
B)
LOL

i accidently turned off my computer
I'd lol if their unreal was the version that had the almighty backdoor
most likely
it'd just be fitting for PS to be like that
derp
iirc they haven't updated shit for ages
^
i think their last update was like

lmao
oh shit
/me is googoling

:<
Did I get banned or something yesterday? lmao
nah
Your too good to get banned
I never got banned here
4of cour- i mean, no, why would you be banned?
heya
4i got banned for 20 mins once
4don't remmber why though
Why XD
Oh
Fail
hmmm?
YAY A NEWBIE!
/me huggles the Newbie
03hm
03I need to find a way to scan registry changes
Sorry for crushing your hopes. :/
XD
Windows Defender?
/me shot
03nah
I already knew it was you
03basically here's what I'm trying to do
Felt pretty good, actually.
03in Windows media Center, you can do this little test to see if your computer is good enough to record in HD
your hostname makes it obvious derp
I wonder why? xD
and heya SLM
03if it is, it asks you to click a button that makes a registry change allowing you to record HD
03what I want to do is figure out what it does
03:P
aah, LOL
Not sure then XD
But windows defender does detect those changes
;p
03there was this Nirsoft program but you have to know the specific task, and ehshell doesn't do it
03I doubt it
03since WMC is a windows program
03it's n ot gonna do that
I blocked EW apple from making a quicktime registry change to autostart XD
But okay XD
Have fun searching :o
[10:55:47] <@helen> hi :)
[10:55:50] <Magix> :P
._.
03autostarts are easy
03just look in msconfig
derp
I wish someone would die for once. It'd make things a lot more interesting around here.
lmao
o.o
lol msconfig
Not naming who. lol
[10:51:08] <DreamMagma> of cour- i mean, no, why would you be banned?
[10:51:28] <DreamMagma> i got banned for 20 mins once
I don't mean channel ban lol
Msconfig is Pro
I meant server ban, more specifically, BOPM going ballistic at my IP and banning me for being on dronebl or something
tk
Boom bam.
03oh
03a program called RegShot
03that should work
03and it also sounds dirty
03fun stuff
/me dies in a Poo Cabin.
Yes
To clean up those dirty registries
03ew wtf
