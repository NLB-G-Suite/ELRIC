Actually RPing is simply the act of pretend to be a character
/me we should always talk in me
SuperBrony64 : if you say so....*gives you a hug and a filly Trixie*
11,02VenHur: I honestly can't think of 10 characters to be added in Smash Bros, but I think that Professor Layton would be cool and a character from Rhythm Heaven maybe :)

If it hadn't been for this brilliant video guide I would probably have had to leave my town, I couldn't bear the shame of my lack of toothpick-

"User: Whos your favorite pony?Cleverbot: I like U2."<- wut
13out of all the fast food places with fries, i like burger king's best
and thats why we wear cups
And Burger King is just evil.
0,14They're dubbing Tiger and Bunny?!
13How pure is your soul?
Hahaha
13K O!
SaxyPretender yep
0,14Burger King has the best burgers, McD's has best fries
00,10ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

okay i like this show so far
13aaaaaaaaaaimmashootagunandnotpunch
Both have shitty both.
Meh.
winter wrap up works too...cleverbot is better than expected
13and grunt like a gorilla
Well let's just say the 'why' is for..."WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?"
13Then I'm not gonna tell you
ikr
I like McD's better for everything.
huh
I only like BKs chicken stuff
McD's fries are incredibly bad.
13^
00,10get9
I like Checkers fries
Yeah well
I just cannot stand McD's fries.
the cleverbot said RD is fav pony i asked why and it said she wasnt its fav pony PARADOX
13I heard a Celestia/Discord one was in the works
13this bgm or the last one, this is run rabbit junk
That's cool I mean I can't expect everyone to like the same things I do.
00,10show has some great music
13brb, checking
Of all fast food places Harvey's has the best burgers because they're actually capable of somewhat pretending they are actually burgers.
Potentially.
Taco Bell has best fries >_>
this time its even better. "Me: Who is your favorite pnoy? Cleverbot: Shakespeare."
0,14...I call shenanigans
And I'm English so I've never heard of Checkers or Harveys.

0,14yeah, that's what I thought too, Sketch_Toku_Brony
Its a rather 'Southern' thing...
i said : this answer is false. clever bots response: who is best pony
I heard they had a PR disaster when they claimed to be against gay marriage.
its learning
Apparently it's required that all full body prosthetics for females be fast, hot, and insanely underclad for anything practical.
And then something about muppets.
That's all I know of that particular franchise.
Rather random.
ikr kencolt
Hello everypony.
Hi Canadian_Brony
13Nothing :(
Update on cleverbot, it's new fav pony is infact RD.
ello Canadian_Brony
13because we can totally do that in a few minutes!
Chick-fil-a??
The muppets withdrew support for the place because they wouldn't affiliate with bigots. Or something.
Dovah FTW!
Is this Sumica singing?
The only thing I accept about McD's is their 1$ drinks.
sure
lol
Go in, buy a drink, sit.
13the chick-fil-a thing was just an overreaction
Profit.
Hehe, $1 Tea cup... fill it with soda.

With a rice cooker you just stick the rice in it with water, flick a switch, and go do something else.
/me is incredible math
wut
It's truly an amazing invention.
MirrorImage, Geometry
I can cook from a recipe.
I cant cook to save my life. Id burn water if i tried to boil it.
I'm going to guess it's Sumica streaming?
surf now?
0,14I'm learning to cook the hard way
TheRandomkid321, ya
But if I try from memory or improv I set the kettle alight.
TheRandomkid321 - based on the SumiPony in the corner, good guess
0,14folks are gone for the week
math surfs
Japan sometimes writes english lyrics just because they sound cool. Not because they make any sense.
MirrorImage: gawd I wish I paid more attention in math class back in the day. This woulda been a perfect mathjoke moment
:D
0,14fortunately, mom made rice and prepared meat and chicken
nuuuuuuu
Kencolt, sometimes, not all the time

0,14IT MEANS I DIED COOKING
(Night Ravebrony)
0,14IN WHICH CASE I WANT LET YOU ALL KNOW
13mm the thumping sounds of trying to scare squirrels out of our walls....
no no no, that would never work. I need something for a memory about a forgotten memory of the past.
0,14I LOVE YOU GUYS
-_(\
You have squirrels in your walls?
0,14that's just nutty
13sadly..
you know what I mean, right?
yes
nope :P
/me 4NO.
...a remembrall memory?
You did NOT just make that pun.
0,14Yes.
0,14Yes I did.
is this a combo of all the pop songs ever .... acutally that sounds fuckin epic
13there's a nice hole in the soffet outside... this time of year we hear squirrels and/or mice scratching around in the wall
You won't die cooking.
Blame it on the pop
You'll die with AN AXE IN YOUR FACE.
not really Quick_Thinker
would that be a good way to describe it?
something about a promise to never forget.
Quick_Thinker: all the black eyed peas songs and such
13is that an axe of capitalism?
13right in his face?
It's an axe, it has no political allegiance.
so, something I would never listen to if it wasnt on this
all I need is one line
00,10it's a good remix
and I got nothin'
nevver listen to black eyed peas (actually i have no clue what songs they make
0,14it might
Sumica: indeed
0,14I think it'd side with the sharpest party
THE COOKING AX OF CAPITALISM
Bed time for me. Good night everypony!

anyhoo brb need a drink
Excercise wheels.
Aren't those made of metal?
0,14wasn't there a blue moon the other night?
Plastic.
I'm writing a story. I've been stuck on the first line for half an hour.
00,10round windows seems like a waste of space
Wasn't really blue.
Sumica: how so?
0,14first you wiggle your tail oink oink oink
0,14:2
0,14(:3
0,14...
Canadian_Brony: Once upon a time....
A blue moon is when a full moon appears twice in under a month.
0,14ah
Colt_Silver Sumica no. I need something about a memory. A promise to never forget.
Sumica: In the beginning...
my god
that texan robo
robot
00,10it was the best of times it was the worst of times
Canadian_Brony: It was the case to end all cases.
NO!
a texan weeaboo
0,14I'm guessing the original voice must've had a Kansai-ben accent
this is going to be DIALOGUE
that sold ALL of his body basically
That robot reminds me of Victor from FallOut: New Vegas
Canadian_Brony: sounds like exposition. Snip it out.
13generally the months don't line up that way
-_(\
yeah
13thus "once in a blue moon"
why am I asking you for advice?
SaxyPretender: sounds like Yesman from Fallout
Funny thing about the Major
0,14...can't say I know who that is, Colt_Silver
She's 98% synthetic
And again, it's not really blue.
Canadian_Brony: because I have a literary background in scriptwriting and exprience writing for 2 indie movies that made it to independent film festivals?
ALSO, if she ever quit the organization
She'd have to forfeit her body
So the only ones really legitimately excited were the meteorologists who like this kind of thing.
wait
The transit of Venus was a pretty big thing, a few months back.
Since it's mostly governtment property
that was a FAKE texan accent?
:p
She'd have to get a brand new Shell
Oddly enough, he's right on one thing-- Pigs are incrediby closeto humans in surgical compatability-- so this isn't out of the realm of scientific possibility.
13yup that's extremely rare
Maybe we can get Bill Gates to make a giant blue light on the moon.
13the last was in 2004 i think
Kencolt: enope
Kencolt: cyborg mice recently
After all, blue is the best colour.
TAG
Colt_Silver great. Ever written a Human in Equestria fan-fic that you are trying to make an actual story and not a "Mary-Sue Perfect World"?
Lies.
LIES.
0,14it's funny
0,14most of the stuff around me tends to be blue
HIS BRAIN IS GONE!
0,14but my favorite color is red
Canadian_Brony: Sometims you gotta go with a Mary-Sue just to show how dark things can really get.
13before 2004 the last venus transit was 1882
nice shot
-No, yellOOAAAAAAAHHH
13next won't be until 2117
13we'll all be dead or virtual by then
I will be dead!
yay Tachicoma!
My vote's for ded
Anyway
13it better be the latter or i'm haunting everything forever
Good colours are red or gold for luck.
We probably won't get that far in our lifetime.
We'll be dead.
Aw, Shizu, we wouldn't mind you haunting us.
Or, rather, we'd be haunting with you.
0,14so...
That sounded way creepier than your probably meant it to.
13yeah but haunting shizu would not be as.... wubful...
0,14Shizuka would be a ghost in a shell?
We shall be hauntbuddies in the afterlife.
13i am sure haunting shizu would be not very fun at all...
I'd be way more fun if I were haunting people.
13Welp, I'm out, peace you cancerous husks.
that inconspicouus
Nah, it would be like Casper the friendly ghost.
I wouldn't have to give a shit about anything, just stealing peoples car keys.

Or rather, Shizu the Cheerful Spectre
Colt_Silver theme . . . uhh . . .
13oh is this the one with the hearts

how do I explain that?

Shizuka: it has the one with the texan box bot

Hello everypony.

And very little.

Oh hey Canadian_Brony!

Seriously why does he excercise?
He's a CYBORG
no no, wait
I was trying to say hi to kirz
13best scene ever
00,10Reminds him of his humanity
Oh yes Shizuka
lol
13^-^
dat misogynism xP
and then he punches himself out
rofl.
stop hitting yourself!
find a Stronghold start taking all the stone/books stuff until there is nothing but the portal
The Major is a super hacker
0,14stop hitting yourself!
Is She Naturally female or is she in a fembot body?
She's also slightly androygnous I would guess
really need to go to lseep
anyway i should go to sleep, Goodnight everyone
13richard epcar is a brilliant va
SaxyPretender: ninjad
yes Colt_Silver
lol
Colt_Silver: she was originally female
0,14later TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Going to sleep, Goodnight everyone
Night Trix
Night T.
otakon: so wait, does that mean shes not anymore?...
bye TheGreatAndPowerfulT
The Major
night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
13we learn about her backstory next season
I read th manga
Colt_Silver: but she's been in a cyborg body so long she's basically just memories and a personality
g'night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
and then batou gets his ass kicked
0,14I think he was at ANime Boston this year
Night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
:3
Colt_Silver: think of it just of her mind left in a robot body she can switch out when she wants to
otakon: so, when you say cyborg, you mean android
13how can you be "so number nine"
13number nine of WHAT
cowvarkian: well no, Android are robots that are made to resemble humans
I just don't see the logic given their line of work.
13came in ninth place in the lyrics writing contest?
I am incredible math :+
Shizuka: how can you be "incredible math"? We'll never know..
Seven of Nine?
besides a female android is a Gynoid IIRC
how IS she when she doesn't surf?
13well for that scene at the end, it's an effective distraction
otakon, if she were a cyborg, then she would just have some cybernetic parts
Surfless.
13while you're busy staring, she's already hacked through your brain
O/////O
0,14if Seven of Nine breaths a sigh, what do you get?
so, technically she is an android
cowvarkian: she's got SOME organic parts
SaxyPretender: Assimilated.
Resistance is futile.
otakon, such as what
SaxyPretender: a punch to the nuts
cowvarkian: android have NO organic part
and she's underestimated a lot
13just the brain in the braincase
what?
...ERRMAHGURD BABBIES
13she's otherwise 100% prosthetic
Shizuka: but she can switch out bodies too remember?
13yup
but I think too much clothing interferes with the active camo systems they have
Chest hurts, can't sing well, sing song that's too fast for me evern when I can sing
13but that's just a case of taking the brain out and putting it back in
Shizuka: oh yeah
For that to work you'd first have to be staring.
0,14well, yes, but you also get a Sigh-Borg :3
so, she's an android
Shizuka: I remember that, but I forget that part
cowvarkian: NO
In other words a full body cyborg-- ala Robocop, but nicer to look at.
Shizuka: so she has ALTS in RL?
yes
13well the active camo they use the full body suits
13sort of
cowvarkian: ANDROID IS A STRAIGHT UP ROBOT, NO HUMAN EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER
technically a cyborg, but more robot then human
And if you're in that kind of scenario and that's all it takes to distract you a loud noise would probably also work.
this a mario 64 pmv?
otakon, stop raging, i know what im talking about
sound lot like mario
cowvarkian: CYBORG IS ROBOT WITH ORGANIC PARTS
Um
Er
in the movie it's the android, and some clothing
Okay
No it's Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini
This sounds nothing like mario 64 :S
So that's what you were talking about
cowvarkian: no you don't since you're not seeing the difference here
*the android body
Ahaha
AYAY
Oh yeah, that xP
inb4 diabeetus
I was referring to one of the scenes in the manga.
love dis :D
Oh, right. I forgot that the rest of you are weak.
Ah, beep beep

hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!
13is a visual disaster
Are there multiple mangas?
androids are robots built to resemble humans
dont know how to let oyu know
otakon: thats what I meant
I remember one that had a lot of colour.
and now I'll never put words on te screen
I prefer the original MV SO CUTE <3
SO CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
And a rather gratuitous cybersex scene.

cowvarkian "Beep Beep"
cowvarkian: her BODY is TECHNICALLY android but as she has a human personality and mind she's a cyborg.
first time i heard this i thought itwas from the chippetes
now i know
otakon, i know
What was the thing just before. It looked like a YTPMV but with ponies
I read Naruto Bleach and One Piece, mainly because I started getting into them when I was like, 14 and now feel obligated.

And now for the ladies :3
Canadian_Brony: you sure have a low tolerance
well at least he doesn't have the crotch bulge going
Shizuka: haha I cant say either before I manage to sneeze
otakon: oh this is FMP...i thought it was Ghost in the Shell
unlike David Bowie
*one
thank God he's not David Bowie
otakon: no because while he was holding it down with his hands, the other guy could put a rock on it
otakon: you sure bout htat
13you mean too bad he's not david bowie
otakon: it would be easier
twilight_sprinkle: then it was the SAME DAMN RESULT with an extra step
DAMMIT CAMERA

And kick

Unlike myself.
Yes
True, the daribot kicks

Who has no interest in learning cylindrical co-ordination.
Is this the true meaning of insanity? :D

13in all seriousness i need to get one of those blindfolds..
oh wow....The music score is beautiful...
00,10they help so much Shizuka
goodnight Kirz|GW2
Its like something from looney tunes when it was real big
13especially when i have a tendency to need to sleep while the sun is rising...
00,10I used them alot on the train
13rarity got some good distance on that with a casual toss
Dat music
Uhm....
silent pony?
Anyone else.....
i think i shall follow in Kirz's footsteps...night everypony
silent?
The music...Its so beautiful...
You sure do quiet a lot.
I can't hear the voices :(
13YEAH TOAST
Tyler_The_creator: thats the point...BGM version
nevermind
Tyler_The_creator: This is BGM only version
I hate toast.
Tyler_The_creator: we're going through the music scores
BGM?
These are my extra moustaches.
I can hear Sweetie Pie's squeaks
13i need to make my own soundboard with stuff like "YEAH TOAST" and pyro
er
BGM?
Wombo combo
Bell.
-_-
Tyler_The_creator: background muzik
Only background mudic
music
Back groun music
I see.
*ground
13back grown music?
13ew
What exactly is the point?
fandubs?
Tyler_The_creator: by any chance r u a rapper and are 21 years old?
Good night NocturnalBlade
You guessed it.
Because the BGM score rocks so much it deserves to be heard on its own
I like this.
The founder of Wolf Gang.
00,10the point is no one ever enjoys the music and other foly work that is done
13dubs, appreciating the bgm, translations
I do
... Even though you're NOCTURNAL :S
and after that i go to bed for real...night all

if you listen hard enough, you can still hear the voice acting
cereal + carrots + eggs + saucepan = fried eggs
logic
Polydunami: yea i know, the irony is too much XD
seems legit
its like something from a feature film Direct-to-DVD looney tunes movie.
Don
Sweetie Belle is best CMC
00,10many dont even realse each pony has their own theme music
This background music is pretty good.
lies, scootaloo is best cmc :$
^
Oh my, maybe for at least a segment, Shizuka
00,10I can never pick a best CMC
Sumica: whoah really? how can u tel?
00,10I love them all too much
Vaccume
Howdy everypony
twist is best cmc........ wait
Hi Malk.
Hey Malk
00,10Colt_Silver, it usesly plays when they first show up
God, I love Twist.
Twist is most underrated pony.
Vorpal
ello Malk
it needs more cowbell
13this needs something.... like... fine motor skills...
Scootaloo deserves the most love tbh. Shes a crippled pegasi disowned by her pegasi parents for her disability and forever banished to live amongst the earth ponies.
JESmith71: Ditto
Pinkie pie style.
my primary function is failure...
Actually, I lied. Princess Celestia is most underrated pony :3
00,10they even do things like ajusting the echo
13yeah it's not easy at all to strip out vocals only
I wonder if Swainize will show up for the new episodes...
lol whats wrong?
13especially for squeaky bell
what's the server address for PonyChat again?
00,10well the front tracks are gone Shizuka
princess celestia needs to do something for a change <.<
Polydunami: Trollestia too
Who?
00,10but the echo effects of a room are in side tracks
:3
Polydunami: he said he would TroIIestia too
my binder is organized chaos
13ah
Oh!
00,10so basicly you hear the voices bouncing off the walls
I was talking to Mike about my chest pain
00,10you wont hear it as much outside
if the world isnt going to love me, ill teach it to fear me instead!
This show has the best facial expressions ever
And drum roll.
^
00,10as you will when they are inside
ded.
Polydunami: He does the same thing as Swainize but records five of the rooms at once and does voice commentary
oh
00,10notice you cant hear them now
Sumica: Its little things like that that makes this show so awesome.
I see.
13ah now i can tell
13ded
00,10the echo effect is even ajusted based on the type of building they are in
G'Night guys.
Part of me feels like he should just get it over with just to get rid of my chest pain
bye xisbestchemical
Night.
Sumica: i could hear them... or amybe it was in me head idonno
Actually, I found out about Bronystate because of Swainize, JESmith71 :$
Epic sister fight
Deeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaad.
Polydunami: Same here
13:O
orite, this is the fear part
What with the Derpy Chat reactions and all :D
Such a thing deserves TWO gasps
Well, that worked out nicely.
13that... was the most perfect yay ping timing i've ever seen
there we go
00,10hehe
So fruit hour is no more?
Thanks Spectrum_Rush :D
just keep asking him, i guess thats all i can tell you
Polydunami: His Derpy video led me here too
omg. Raritys puffed up cheecks.
Polydunami: oh god the split second chat stop, then explosion
I forget which youtube vid had a recomendation for bronystate, but that's how I found out about it.
13meh you can do better belches than that
Oh hey Kinixys, you changed your username I see :3

Them ambient bird sounds
13fine
/me [laughs]
Yeah I did. How did you know?
00,10need that ches cavity to get the good reverb
JESmith71: Holy buck youre right!
Blargh, I was disconnected due to my buggy internet.
Yea... and who says he has to actually listen to my heart? He could just take his headphones off the entire call and not tell me he did.
Drum rolls are always nice.
13headshot
I've never noticed how great the BGM is...

Shizuka, nah the GM is compelling her bitchy aspect for lots of story points
HURUMPH
Celestia confirmed for godpony status
Hi all
Tab key?
When you type the first few characters of someone's username, Kinixys, and then push tab, you get their full username.

Cant get that out of my head

Are Hybrids good?
No worries :)

00,10Kinixys, if you type out part of a name

Beat you to it, Sumica :$
Sumica: slowpoke.jpg
Thank you Sumica

I wish I could play a banjo
Rommulus: BGM only version
I guess Fluttershy likes my idea.
00,10the voices are just fine
13Rommulus: you're deaf, it happens
00,10it must be your end
Rommulus it's the backing track
but the rise of smooze is tomorrow

DerpDash you should already know the answer
why was Rarity wearing twilights element of harmony?
00,10so it's kinda hard to tell but unicorns, the primary color in there cutimark.
unless you are a ...CHANGELING!
00,10Matches the aura color of their magic
Polydunami, I know. I know. I just saw you /part and went "OOOOHHH NOOOO! I forgot to say hai to him! ;_;"
Mangoguy: I didnt listen to this song much
Mangoguy: SO I DONT REMEMBER
I know the pony with the sunglasses and spikey hair is an expy of some real celebrity, but I can'tfor the life of me figure out who
Sumica: not their eyes?
Mangoguy: oops srry for caps
Sumica: I mean aura color = eye color?
Sumica: which makes a certain plot point in a certain 2parter even mr obvious
*more
00,10yep
CiderIsForDrinking: i dont understand
Ninjazz, please don't worry; I didn't want to bother you after all you've been through today
That yay was well timed. Right when Rarity mouthed it
Or at least it made it look like she said it
00,10will have to check more Alchemist
CiderIsForDrinking: And fluttershy = akwardly voiced person for particular situation man
Polydunami, thanks, man. Think I'll head off soon. Need to get my head on other things for now.
00,10but I dont think so
00,10cause twi's aura is more pink
00,10and her eyes are not
Sumica: it was purple in the first season
00,10and celestias eyes are not gold
then they changed it
celestia's aura wasnt gold either in the first season
Sumica: good example Shining Armors eye color to magic color
aww man now i have to restart my laptop brb everypony :(
slight remix of Bolero there?
00,10yeah season 1 disproves the rule
00,10but they wanted to make the magic more noticable
Isn't it Fancy Pants? :p
00,10love this song
Pinkie knows how to PARTAAAY!
/me Dances
Rockin' 50s party tunes
Octavia!
:D
00,10fancypants aura is golden but his eyes are blue
I wonder if Octavia will get canonized in S3
St. Octavia? There's a good ring :3
day music sounds a bit familiar
Pope Octavia the VXII?
*dat
haha
you know what I mean :D
Alchemist: shot from a cannon?
twilight_sprinkle: no. turned INTO a cannon
I LOVE pinkie Pie's face when it's covered in chocolate :3
Alchemist: woah
wha maller?
twilight_sprinkle: eat THAT bass cannon!
wonder if they will do anything with the octavia-scratch duo that w came up with
Alchemist: bleh, classical isnt about bass!
I Hope they do
scratch and octavia doing a cannonball race. after being shot from cannons
to be a fancy pony you must have giant hats
and ties
and lobotomy
00,10this reminds me of pewees big adventure
this song <3
Dark_Horst: dunno, in most fanfics they are shipped and hasbro wont approve of that.
peasants have crashed the party!
11th
Alchemist: not outricht shipping of course
yeah lobotomy too.. wait wat?
Twi dance <3

Dat awkward dancing
Sumica: the breakfast machine opening?

Why, Danny Elfman, don't you make music for MLP?
00,10yeah Spectrum_Rush

Sumica: there is actually a vid on youtube with someone fro ma show dancing similarly
00,10I ment more like check the pony on screen twilight_sprinkle

Moopy: read up a few lines >_<
Well, he's in the wrong for rummaging through your bag and for what he did to Fluttershy, but you were in the wrong for reacting so violently. =/
^^
hello strawberrie_smuckerz
dang

yeah . ya supposed to find 5 of your friends and turn him into stone...
^

ok
Unless you find the buffer wheel entertaining. :P
Well I Can't Go Uncaptialed
wish i could stream
What would you stream, spitfirecolt2?
borderlands or some netflix
hello
Netflix wouldn't be a good idea
i would stream borderlands 2 when it comes out
pffft boderlands please
I've got a pile of Assassin's Creed games lying around on my Steam that I've never played before. I'd probably stream that and let everybody watch me fumble around like a noob. :P
omg :D
:D
:D
Ohai again :)
hai MaxTheBrony
ohai MaxTheBrony
my sister found out i was a brony yester day
:o
did she approve?
x_x
she still cant stop laughing when ever she looks at me
D:
:'(
:s y she so mean .
i got sister like you
...
My brother knows and he says i can do whatever i feel like doing :)
every one at school know about me beeing a brony epesilay after today
:o
how come?
didnt i say befor some guy went in to my bag found my flutter shy and riped off its head so i kicked his ass and now my knukles hrut maxthebrony
xD
:o Why would he rip off the head?
`And what kind of school are you going too , with people like that :s
hes a hater he still has the head
:s
therainbowvortex, Max wasn't on when you talked about that, so he didn't know.
oh sorry max
but seriosly the skin on most of my knukls has peeled off
:O
damn pretty serious fight then?
yer i think i hit him a little to hard maby :|
i wen't to school today, and my friends has welcomed me "hi fuc*'in brony" :C
now i don't have friends in school yaay
I dont know whats the big deal is , If we ( the bronies ) arent showing the pony stuff in their faces they shouldnt give a fuck of what we are watching when we are at home.
I dont get the haters :S
applejack my mates betrayed me to
If they cant accept you they never was your mates.
only a handful of people can acept it
ponies ponies everywhere <3
but no one eles i know is a brony i feal so alone :'(
Growing up I found that it was actually easier to not have any friends than to hang out with people who don't actually like you.
applejack`: sadly, some of the only ones who accept the show, are other bronies. so i'm lucky to have brony freinds like you guys :)
same therainbowvortex , no one i know knows.
hey guys look at this i am tower tooth
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZHKjgmHdmA&feature=player_detailpage
:)
But i dont see the point in telling my friends.
Its just a show , its not a life style.
People tend to forget that.
i meen you guys are freainds (soz about my speling) and it makes me relly proud to be a brony how all you acept me
Yeah, see? Who needs friends in real life when you have us to come home to?
:)
MaxTheBrony: to some people (like me) it is a lifestyle. most of the things i choose to do in life are for MLP
MaxTheBrony: like how i didnt weant to go to a safari on october becuase that month, season 3 is airing apparently
Ah , excuse me Flyboy didnt mean to offend :)
awww fu*k it, we love ponies and no one can change it!
MaxTheBrony: its ok, no offense taken.
applejack`: /)
Hey All, I feel like drawing something however I am having a blank moment, any suggestions?
Ponies?
:p
nah , but what do you like to draw?
Rommulus: think of a game you like to play, and draw something out of that
i get real sad at time but then i watch mlp or come on here and it make me smile
hmm, flyboy actually that gives me an idea, thanks!
:)
some times i feal like no one realy wants me around just because i watch mlp
therainbowvortex: we all get that feeling sometimes. but you dont always have to be around people. some people feel better alone
therainbowvortex: When I was in school I KNEW nobody wanted me around, and it was just because I'm a nerd.
i get past that by having all the episodes on my phone so when i'm bored, i can just watch a few
I just started in a new class , Its a gamedesign class, and got really surpirsed there was only nerds there :D
I eventually got over it and just did my own thing. Fuck everybody else. If they don't like what you like, whatever.
:)
I can finally realate to my other class mates
when i get sad i hum pinkie pie smile song and know that she'll probly kill me if i dont smile
giggle at the gosthies?
that to
I sitt and listen to Brony songs all way to and from school , im to afraid to listen in it :D
Finding somebody you can relate to is awesome, but experience taught me that you get the best results by not trying to find anybody and just letting the kindred spirits come to you.
:D
whenever i am depressed i watch pinkie pie and i am happy again
Gold_Demona that was exactly waht i did .
new people , new personalities
Exactly.
its imposibly to watch pinkie and not smikle
i mean smile
Especially during Smile Smile Smile
yer
winter wrap up winter wrap up :)
:D

you dont know if the admin of eqd is even on here *still shaking*
00,02then again, 2 hours
If you were sorry to say it you'd have said nothing.
What you meant to say was "Weed is stupid and if you do it I look down on you"
now now, enough with the drug talk kiddies

Honestly, brats these days can't even grow enough spine to talk down to people.
anyways, it's after 6am

When I'm on my old computer, the only way I can get a stable framerate is to watch a video that defaults to 360p and switch it to 240p. If it can't support that format or is in 240p by default, it'll lag on me no matter what.
05drawn too much over the past days xD

ermagerd fallout :D
I was gunna say that there is a stream. :D
of course... Wrek is OP >.>
<3_<3
You didn't even take all the good stuff! Which was basically everything above 10 caps!
Wrek i love dis game /)^3^(\ i wish i had it v.v
Herostar, you should get it ^^
Are you playing on that Hardcore difficulty Wrek?
Panda how? and where?
When I played fallout I would stuff everything I couldn't carry in a mailbox close to the spawnpoint.
what game is this abput *still shaking*
Herostar well... buy it of course.
How much v.v
I MEAN ABOUT
That way if I needed money, I could quicktravel and sell it all.
Nuclear war happened in an amercia that never left the '50s mentality.
ermagard cone
Wrek you know thats a traffic cone, right?
oh wow...
Traffic cone with a mine underneath
BAM
there is a mine there...
Herostar: Had a mine under it. :P
Looks like this isn't wrek's first playthrough
O_O_ hoh that gunshot scared me i treated it as it was lightning *still shaking*
ಠ_ಠ i worry bout that man sometimes... oh, a mine you say? i see now
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOOOUU
HOLY
GORE
headshot...
First time I went through there, I didn't pay any attention to the cones. It didn't end good. AND BEAUTIFUL GORE
he takes the potato and leaves the ammo -.-
Wrek, just wondering, do you have any mods installed?
is this a steam game?
hm... was going to challenge Wrek to a speed run of this game..... now I must reconsider....
Wrek: You dont have what it takes to defuse them?
Herostar, eeyup
a well cooked potato is a beautiful thing
05Klumzeedragon: cone is in the way
I will see about getting it since this game is epic
You can easily defuse them Wrek
Herostar: You can also get it on consoles if you felt so inclined.
AdamTheDuck yeah... you have to have a certain level.... otherwise you will trip
Klumseedragon i always do it via steam
Ooooh.
XD
Awe, true to Caesar/
The Kaiser has... DED!
Note 1: Always have a extra pair of powerful armor...Just cause ITS LOGICAL
the only thing that call of dut games will never be as realistic as is that you wont die by one shot
Wrek: Ah. Dem pesky cones. I guess I never tried difusing those ones. But I love the extra xp for doing it.
... nobody use vats anymore...
Nobody uses melee weapons anymore...
AdamTheDuck: I do.
which version is this?
and then wrek used the bushwaker
Yay another melee enthusiast like myself :P
Sawn off shotgun? let's leave it!
AdamTheDuck: Only recently though...Mmm...The Baseball bat to a fresh legionare head....
With spikes in it.
SUPAH FUCKING SLEDGE
GRAAAAAAHHH!
o.o
since i cant comment on eqd cause i dont know how to sighn up ill role play as rarity HERE in my next chat
05Herostar: the way im playing, i cant afford grabbin' everything. besides my current shotgun is better
I always liked the crazy fist weapons in this game :D
Wrek what version is this?
.....Was that really worth it.
Wrek: ammo weighs nothing! and sells well! get all of it!
version?
Flyboy hardcore mode.........
Flyboy, hardcore mode?
Flyboy: ...In hardcore, ammo has weight.
ooooh...
yeah like is it vegas ultimate or what
Hardcore isn't hardcore enough imo :P
i'm too used to playing fallout 3 -.-
those diamond armor thing's from that one game are just FABULAS and that attorey with black pointing hair *gasp* IDEEEAAAAA!!!!!
Herostar not sure... I think it is. I dont know what he has installed though.
:$ did you like it *still shaking
Of course... PICK ALL THE TOBACO!
05hardcore does what hardcore sets out to do
05make sure you eat drink and sleep
make it hardcore??
05adn that everythign weighs
05thats all its intended to do
Hardcore=Realistic.
So it just makes it realistic.
Except for the part of being killed in one shot.
aircraft so you can take multiple shotgunshells?
in irl?
Herostar: No...Why do you ask?
Well I mean
Unless they're like to a leg or a foot
then yes.
yeah read back a bit and you'll see why i brought it up
Herostar: I don't like reading.
i betchya it has the same hit physics as irl
rainbow dash tried to read a fanfic and only read 80% percent of it he knew that the other 20% wouldnt make him any cooler
btw- 1 shotgunshell in the leg = missing leg.
goodluck living with that, in the middle of nowhere
flutterchu: "he"?
Herostar: I know but DAMMIT YOU'RE hurting my BRAIN
*scream* i almost had a heart attack (DONT DIE) *still shaking*
You're not even taking the money....
Why don't you pick up the denarius Wrek ?
The...money...
Dark_Horst: sorry cool fact is i thought rainbow dash was a boy until I watched the sonic rainboom
dat villification XD
Herostar: well it's already bad enogh im shaking from lightning and my coat is white
alright, for real now. nini all ^^
Night Panda|Sleepies
flutterchu relax a bit :P
Herostar: i cant i have astrophobia
lightning can't harm you. and it's thunder thats loud.
astro-whatnow?
ಠ_ಠ
Herostar: I finally understood what you meant. I see why they no make injuries realistic.
Herostar: it's a big fear of lightning or thunder scared enogh to get you heart attack's *still shaking*
Astraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning.
:3
ooooh.. you poor thing :(
05Herostar: why so offensive?
Wrek it was more of a joke, sorry
Herostar: hey im not poor *still shaking*
flutterchu well so much for my sympathy -_-
....
flutterchu: where do you live?
Oh, this place is so close to a blind deathclaw.
Flyboy: im not telling you that
Herostar: Not everyone knows expressions. He probably thought you meant money wise.
-sigh- i really just cant get a laugh, nor do i have any worth for being here nowadays -_-
or where one usually is.
flutterchu: i meant country...
Flyboy: for some reason i dont want to tell you that
Herostar: and I laughed at your joke about wrek. :O

Rommulus: I think it's nice ivory and silver. :P
mentalyeffedguy: not with ponies, no
nasty sjitt
MadSurge: fighting scene was good enogh without blood
I think its the little details like that, that can really make a game more immersive.
Rommulus, http://goo.gl/naWib Hmm seems to be a bit of both, but mostly gold.
*still shaking*
has anyone read any good fanfics lately?
I love how we're talking about no gore as Wrek blows the head off mutiple ghouls. :D
flutterchu: there's plenty of good fighting scenes without or with minimal blood
MadSurge: i was talking about a canterlot wedding in mlp
mentalyeffedguy: Um, I've only read like 3 fanfics. :D
flutterchu: that was glorious :D
Klumzeedragon: ive read like 4-5 i think
AdamTheDuck: Can you get a back view of the gun? if not its all good.
MadSurge: i wasnt really asking for that i became a brony on aprill 1st this year poniville confidental was the first episode ive ever seen
mentalyeffedguy: Oh? Which ones? :) The last one I went through was The Ballad of Twilight Sparkle. It's a trixiextwilight fanfic. But it's like PG and hilarious.
eyupp
*still shaking*
flutterchu: :D was it a good starting epipde?
....Is he really....
MadSurge: i already knew some ponies before i watched an episode
Rommulus, http://images.wikia.com/fallout/images/b/b0/Lucky.jpg Not really back but it's on the wiki :P
TheRandomkid321: No one really cares how you feel about it mate. Just dont do it again?
long post is long

Herostar have you ever seen a government document, a script, or a great story that is of minimal length?
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48880115/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/
TheRandomkid321 well, one of my grandfather's missionfiles.
You know, maybe I just don't like the wasteland environment in the Fallout series
CrimsonPhoenix, It's not for everyone.
AdamTheDuck, I know

08,01flutterchu: again, no rp
mentalyeffedguy, http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
mentalyeffedguy, we should probably tell you to read the rules, but don't worry about it.

Metronome Roleplay
08,01i think fear of lightning should be called thoraphobia
lol
Idont see him rping :/
brb
no that's thunder
Metronome about 24h ago he was doing it alot
Oh.....
Herostar I beg to differ...
Thoraphobia sounds like a fear of hammers to me...
TheRandomkid321 so THORaophobia isn't funny?
why did i drive up to a conversation talking about phobias *still shaking*
flutterchu: whats with the shaking?
Herostar I never said that. I find it slightly humorous but I am positive that there are supirior jokes out there.
ice shotgun is awesome
...And it could be kinda useful for mods:P
mentalyeffedguy: He shakes during the thunder and lightning and tells us he's doing it for some reason.
ohhhhh
mentalyeffedguy: when im alone on the computer im SUPER CAREFUL but i shake alot and i shake even faster somtimes when thunder strikes
i like me some thunder!
I am positve there are creatures of the paranormal residing in my residence. And I am a rather inelligent being who has faith in science.
KA-BOOM! <---Prime thunder right there.
Klumzeedragon: i dont even know where your at *still shaking*
them demons are freakin massive O_O
aiight then
its raining like hell where im at!
mentalyeffedguy: ditto
and its REALLY foggy
Can i say i have entomophobia if i have a fear of insects crawling across me?
rendering length short
mentallyeffedguy so you live in silent hill?'
They're called super mutants, but that particular group are called the nightkin TheRandomkid321
Herostar: They're mutated Super Mutants. 6_9 If mutants can really get mutated further.

^LOLO

When I was playign slender earlier (broad daylight BTW) I saw a siluoette of a defenite human shape that was over my shoulder it then walked to the side. I looked behind me and I saw nothing.

The shape was in the glare of my computer
Batman?

TheRandomkid321: Trick of the mind perhaps. :)

TheRandomkid321, answer = ninja :P
Klumzeedragon not when I stared at it for 5 seconds.
Dem ghoulettes
Ew
TheRandomkid321: Then perhaps you have a spirit living with you. You seem fine enough to figure that it's not hostile if it is infact real.
uggggghhhhhhh still thinking of molestia O~O *still shaking*
I know what state she is in... doesn anyone want to know i'll pm ya.... nah jk I won't bother.
molestia?
ouch
Klumzedragon of course its not hostile.
SO mny traps
why is everything exploding in fallout?
TheRandomkid321: Don't say of course. There some out there that are dangerous.
Klumzeedragon it clealy has been living with me my whole life.
Then agan sometimes I used to wake up with faint scratches on my legs... BEFORE I had a cat.
TheRandomkid321: Well how would i know that when you say you had only seen it for 5 seconds? :P
Rotisary Chicken.
it's funny that i dont have ANY first person shooter not even portal
ded
flutterchu: Portal isnt a shooter. :P
Y did u do that?
antler? meet Wrek.
Metronome, because he killed all the other nightkin
Klumzeedragon: it involves first person with a "gun"
Oh... really?
long story is long
Klumzeedragon she was in victorian maid apparel byw.
Herostar only if you read slowly
flutterchu: Action/puzzler ;)
TheRandomkid321: Dats trippy man. I had something like that happen to me when I was young once.
TheRandomkid321: I havent had any paranormal things happen to me. I have had a friend or two with some problems like that, so I half believe.
ugggggghhhh ghost im afraid of ghost's
Hmm, I wonder if Wrek feels like being a total dick in this quest. :D
I honestly don't know what was up with my brain last night. Now I can barely even think... but last night it's like my brain had taken some sort of performance increaser.
does the girl behind you have a mustace if she doent i must be the wrong game
Mentats.
my sister lives in a house with ghosts :)
Wrek: Sexy space suit you got there. :P
TheRandomkid321: Maybe being by these spirits is getting to you.
So... you're sending Ghouls into space?
Its called the moon.
SirGanjalf: That's the plan. :D
It seems he is going TO THE MMOOOOOON
My friend apparently have been "possessed" by a ghost. He was asleep and suddenly his eyes opened and where a different colour and he was speaking with an adults voice despite being an infant. ALso his religion believes in spirits and reincarnation etc.
TheRandomkid321: it's easy my mom has holy water i even DRANK holy water just spalsh it around each room
flutterchu: why dont you like ghosts? they are cozy
TheRandomkid321: Your friend is an infant?
Aircrafter WAS an infant.
Klumzeedragon: Surely nothing will go wrong:D
At the time of the incident
TheRandomkid321: My bad. :$
mentalyeffedguy: uuuuggggghhhhhhh id rather have ghost bronies
SirGanjalf: Not if Wrek is nice. ;)
WHAT.
Wrek is ina spacesuit. fantastic.
WTF?
Wrek: That cheat. :D
TheRandomkid321: holy water might get spirit's away
dem spacesuits
flutterchu: the ghosts in my sisters house take care of her children, and one is just a child running around upstairs
haha, no clip is always fun :D
And unlock door comand? :D
Da buck? My AJ toy I SWEAR tuned its head 90 degrees to look at me... I must be tiiired.
mentalyeffedguy: youre really creeping me out the lightning is scary enough *still shaking*
SirGanjalf: FUCK NO
flutterchu: im not joking, but they have grown found of it :)
TheRandomkid321: Your spirit friend know you're talking about then. Adress them and then sleep.

TheRandomkid321 ಠ_ಠ wut

Herostar yes but the rules state I am not to speak of stuff like that.
SirGanjalf: That explains everything! :D
flutterchu: That's up to you. I post safe links.
BANJO KAZOOIE WHY DID YOU LEAVE NINTENDO (sorry i had to spit that out)*still shaking*
I can't wait till the next gen of consoles come out. I've heared they are capable of PC graphics.
Because Banjo Kazooie was made by Rare, and Rare left Nintendo
05give it 2 years and the consoles will be outdated again
by then pc will be even better
05thats the problem with them
TheRandomkid321: there's going to be a new gen of gaming?
/me hugs his pc
05unless they come with replacable parts
Yeah, I stopped trying to keep up with consoles.
05upgrade ktis or soemthing
flutterchu: Cause Microsoft gave Rare a better deal, but now instead of letting Rare have their creativity, theyre being forced to make crap.
I will always like the feel of a controller though...Not a mouse and keyboard D:
Wrek I gues but I have always been attracted to them. It seems the way that games were meant to be played... with a controller in hand...
05my current graphcard will keep me happy for atleast anotehr 3 years, expectign 5
05then i can jsut chug a new one in
Wrek: Then they won't be consoles anymore.
why would they let you upgrade your console when they can make you buy a whole new one
05you cant get the same precision controling on a consoles as you can with a mosue and keyboard
flutterchu, welcome to 2000
Rommulus: Because they wear out old farts like us who get tired of buying new consoles every other year. :P
Klumzeedragon: NOOOOOOOOOOOO BANJO KAZOOIE MY FIRST FREINDS EVER I WAS SAD THAT THEY LEFT NINTENDO NOW THERE COMPETELEY GONE GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:'(
and also I like to be able to put a game in and then be able to play it and not need to wait half an hour for it to install.
^
flutterchu they are not gone.... but they might as well be
That feel when you know its right.
05half hour isntalls havent been a problem for ages
05and with steam
^
I plan to buy some previous-gen(now still current-gen) console, when the new ones are released
05they are downloaded isntalled as they are
I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist: http://qtv.ua/uploads/public/novosti_igronavtov/13185978218186.nrs.jpg
05in fact
hello everypony its been AGES how is all of ya :)
05the isntall abr has been replaced with the download bar
Hello ninja_pony
https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lLuMOWyrW7Q/UEOM-Lo5L4I/AAAAAAAAE4c/AwIFoocklgk/s1600/AdmiralAppleJack.png awesome picture much?

TheRandomkid321: NO fuck shitty microsoft just want's a new puching bag I WISH I CAN SHOW THEM A PEICE OF MY MIND FOR TAKING AWAY MY FIRST FREINDS *still shaking*
mentalyeffedguy that's our wrek that made it
flutterchu: Not gone. Just not made new. You can get the originals on Xbox if you awnted
whaaaaaaaaaat?!!?!!?!?!???!1
05ohai
flutterchu...

how the flying ducksause shitfacedelephant did you do that?!
mentalyeffedguy yeah he did
i will never like you microshit anymore!!!!
mentalyeffedguy, Magic my dear, magic. :P
i wish i could make art :l
Welcome back Klumzeedragon :P
wow it is diffacult to find ANY infomation on season 3 hmm :|
ninja_pony: the cmc will appear in episode 4
ninja_pony maybe because people don't want to spoil themselfs and have a common sense of respect to not post any at all
05ninja_pony: implying youd ever want any info besides airdate
Thanks AdamTheDuck. :D I opened the Admiral AJ and my chat messed up.
Well, there are spoilers about Season 3 out, but we still don't have a premier date.
Said like ViolaGrey was best pony on the top bar and was being weird.
yeah air time i mean lol i dont want spoilers jezz i would be like :'( like i got a MASSIVE spoiler on halo 4 today was lik FFUUUUU :[
ninja_pony, there were no leaks whatsoever
ok there was a few but even then we do not discuss of such in here
05i wonder why game companies dont desig ngames for PCs first
I SHALL NOW CALL MICROSOFT MICROSHIT *still shaking*
CrimsonPhoenix yeah and don't remind me EQD being silly and believing the rumors of when it airs
ninja_pony: Wait. What spoiler about Halo4?
i clicked the source and it said by wreky.......thats awesomly coolio awesome cant come up wih any other words cool
05must be a hell ton easier to port to consoel than the otehr way around
killerpony7733,that's EQD for you
A sad SAD day... I just found out there will be huamns in S3 FREAKIN HUMANS! http://derpy.me/RY-rG
05for isntance scalign down the 2048x2048 textures to the standard 512x512
05et cetc
Klumzeedragon: u DONT want to know a little hint someone that u would hav eNEVER guess comes back thats all ill say
you troll!!
TheRandomkid321's link is just a dancing troll animated gif.
TheRandomkid321: i got trolled :'( *still shaking*
Ooh Wrek, get the Ratslayer rifle, it's located near where you are :3
05also
Wrek: Because they want to make sure it works better on the consoles? Since that's where the larger market is?
okay.jpg
TheRandomkid321: UR A MONSTER U KNOW THAT lol :D purrree evil
05flutterchu: even if you are still shaking, you constantly typign it out is getting old and annoying
05Klumzeedragon dark souls would be a perfect exampel here. excelent game
05but the port didnt do well
TheRandomkid321: Jokes on you, I like being trolled.
I got kicked for it? Worth it!
05EVEN if the PC gamers asked for it
05why?
05becasue the port is a disgrace to gaming
05ofc we hate console ports to PC
05they always fail
Wrek, really? That's too bad.
Wrek: i just think that if i dont type that ill have complains that i dont have astraphobia and i actually do and for pony's to know me more
:P
I hate PC gamers who say console agmers are gay because they don't have "superultrafantasticgraphics!"
Durrr like graphics matter.
Technically, Magicka was originally designed as an XBOX 360 game, and then it was ported to the PC. The original version was scrapped, citing control issues with the controller. But the PC version DOES support the controller, conjuring elements with the right analog stick.
05phobias are always aweful
ive pre-oredered black ops 2
05but we know now
05and those that dont believe oyu i am sure will give you the benefit of the doubt
geckos. they get huge round here.
05otherwise they can fuck emselves
05but right now
05its getting annoyign with the ocnstant typeouts
thanks to this picture of season 3 episode 4 i know http://images.wikia.com/mlp/images/4/42/Will_Anderson%27s_station.jpg
Good Morning all :)
Mornin' Cypresswolf
05technically a spoiler sicne it contains S3 material
05dont link any furtehr liek that
^
05ill look past it this once
Wrek you're too nice today :S
05i know its aweful
05but i cant help it
05<3
What have you done with the Wrek we all know a love for being in a constant bad mood? :D
Wrek: Yeah. It does sound like going from console to PC is harder than PC to console. But they cater to where they get the more business I guess. Wether that's really fair or not. But that's a shame. I was really thinking about getting Dark Souls for the PC for the extra content...
i can imagine my human self in mlp grapics :)
I would yell at hitler.... but if you aked me to yell at wrek I would say "Aw f### that I like living."
mentalyeffedguy: I have it pre-ordered too.
and I just got a new favorite song
If these Brights do their Great Journey, will they do any harm to innocent people?
Kandarihu Nope.avi
Then this really is a bad thing he's doing, by sabotaging their migration.
ill be right bach
05my excuse is: ive always gone with the good option
05and sicne its my 9th playtrhough
05soem variation is nice ^_^
Holy 9th?
Damn
wow 9th
Wrek, I see. Carry on, then.
Well if someone would like to see a decent console port, i'd advice him to check out "Alan Wake" on steam
Do they actually make it to the moon?
That's a good excuse
Rommulus: If he doesnt kill them, I think so. :P
Rommulus, haha no, the moon isn't their intended destination
Where is
hmph chuggaconroy has like 19 playthrough's AND he found a shiny pokemon so this 9th thing is nothing to me
Wrek: how do you make youre art?
Yep, Fallout series are pretty re-playable
Rommulus, doesn't really state, they just want to reach a planet that is naturally full of radiation.
mentalyeffedguy, he draws
I don't even remember how many times i've played first or second Fallout
Wrek: This is that invisible Super Mutant right?
Klumzeedragon, Eeyup
He grabs his tablet, open sai and stroke the stylus on the tablet
like with his hand? with his hand?!
He uses faith, trust, and pixie dust... wait no, that's not it
please dont shoot
mentalyeffedguy, no with his foot
O_O i almost had another heart attack
And his teeth
flutterchu: He has too. :D It's the point of the game.
flutterchu, then lower the volume. :P
Gold_Demona: i beleved that help and the storm stopped but im still shaking and my coat isnt white anymore
Hmm, it the game just freeze?

Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.~
Chat so ded...
we need more death in the mojave
Quick Wrek, give Boone an Anti Materiel Rifle
Hello?
There won't be a Mojave after that :D
i saw a boone cosplay at dragoncon
Hello pony_838252
so awesome
Confound these ponies TheRandomkid321 ?
I even saw a Vash cosplay
and a Mandalorian Twilight Sparkle
i wish i could make that up
Mates? listen I can't sleep. I am terrified of a kid at school I have visions of him gutting people with a saw. The original chat on stream isn't working for me so I am on here without watching the stream.
I saw a Hello Kitty Darth Vader once
TheRandomkid321, middle school?
Bronysith High school. ANyway the original cht is working now. Just a sec.
It's so strange reading TheRandomkid321 's post then reading Gold_Demona 's o.o
XD
LOL XD
I was replying to Bronysith, but that's pretty funny. XD
I wish I had a big iron so I could shoot that insane mother effer in the bloody head.
here i am
So what just happened with the stream? It going down and all?
you crazy fuck! dont you know how to deal with bullies?
Stream is running okay for me
Yeah... Now. :D
mentalyeffedguy He isn't just a bully he is mentally insane. He cut me randomly when I was trying to be his friend
Nope it's all okay and hasn't been screwy at all so far
welp
pick up the closest desk and smashit as hard as you can into his head
i better just upload my pictures to facebook
that bad?
TheRandomkid321 Do you approach him, or does he approach you
?
TheRandomkid321, Fuck, cut? It's illegal to carry a knife in Australia o.o
AdamTheDuck he did it with a sharpner blade.
05dealign with bullies takes finesse
Sharpener...
tell someone then
wat.
05you need to humiliate them
Whatever
05at the rigth time
Does he think he's some badass with a sharpener blade?
05in a situation where there is no way you can be blamed for "his" actions
Wrek: i found myself to outwit them or outsmart them is the best way to humiliate
Wrek or in some cases ignoring them and making them bored of you can get you somewhere
Well only me and my friend know he has autism because he bullies us both
05depedns on the bully really
05if the guy carries a knife
05carry a bigger knoife
I like your think Wrek. :D
I have a SOG Seal Pup 2
oh boy, it crawling in my skin complaining about life again?
Tell someone, honestly no one would blame you. Wrek has a good point to though. XD
You call that a knife? this is a knife!
Buytoast no. and PinkiePry I have told MANY
Have you told adults?
well then who's complaining about what now?
PinkiePry Everyteacher AND the princible knows
05if you were closer to me TheRandomkid321, id visit and speak my midn so to speak
Buytoast I am having visions of a kid in my class gutting people with a saw
brotherhood of steel cosplays
and?
inb4 Wrek takes out his combat knife as I read TheRandomkid321 's post
XD
Buytoast I'm trying to sleep.

Wrek ish best advice giver.

2309 hours
Buytoast You remind me of that kid.

AdamTheDuck yep

the kid gutting people or some other asshole you know?
Buytoast the kid I have visions of him gutting people.
Oh hai people :)
Hello MLP_Brovakiin
MLP_Brovakiin: hi
is all this worry and wanting to tell adults all about visions?
hai MLP_Brovakiin
TheRandomkid321: You're having VISIONS of him gutting people, but what does he actually DO?
that's what all the hubbub is about?
Ok RandomKid, what about this? Why don't you go up to an athority figure and ASK THEM WHY THE FUCK THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING. Pardon my capslock swearing. XD
Like in real life, what does he do?
exactly
PinkiePry done it.
so far all you've said is that you have visions
best advice pinkiepry
but you haven't said anything he's done
:D
Gold_Demona cut's people for pleasure
Its ok if you use your royal canterlot voice Pinkiepry
Yay!
TheRandomkid321: In real life? He ACTUALLY cuts people?
æ
That's call to get the police involved
Seriously I asked him why he cut my and he said "For pleasure, entertainment, and I was bored.
Additem console command? :O
ø
Shameo on you Wrek !
Shame*
05AdamTheDuck: cba combing the building
05there's suppsoed to be 5
05foudn 2
Gold_Demona well he cut me...

Wrek: RELEVANCY http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/392042_3783921432948_95843669_n.jpg
Mass murder is best type of murder
:D
I love bronystate. XD
same
TheRandomkid321: So... Is he STILL cutting people?
Bronysith: Jeez it must of taken ages to make the power armour
AdamTheDuck yeah it is the way to do it.
TheRandomkid321: have your visons ever come true?
05that powerarmor loosk better than it does in game
Gold_Demona not to my knowledge... but he STILL scares me
So have we agreed on mass murder?
Wrek: IKR
05in game the shoulderpads kill it for me
and did you notice Boone?
Bronysith yes but rarely... but he has ITD tomorrow...
Because i'm down for mass murder... Always. XD
Good morning Bronystate! How are all of you today?:)
/me glomps AJIsAwesome
Mornin' AJIsAwesome
AJIsAwesome, we're helping a chum with a bullying problem.
Goodmorning AJIsAwesome :) How are you?
PinkiePry: Who is it?
Sof ar our ideas consist of... mass murder....
Mornin' AJIsAwesome
TheRandomkid321
MLP_Brovakiin: I'm doing petty good:)
Hello AJIsAwesome! :)
so far i am enjoying trigun
Thats good to know :)
MadSurge: Hello!:)
*pretty*
Bronysith: Trigun is awesome
http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/405781_3782450036164_551558034_n.jpg Wrek you may or may not like this pic
Anypony else here watch/read naruto?
TheRandomkid321: Realy?
PinkiePry: I have.
Bronysith: Lol
PinkiePry: you mean ninja filler?
AJIsawsome... yes because we are ALL insane...
Yes, I read ninja Filler
PinkiePry the bully LOVES naruto.
Bronysith: :D Twilight Boba Fett
Ok, to all who have... I LOVE SHINO.
XD
ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh
MadSurge: twilight mandalorian
http://fav.me/d5dh615
TheRandomkid321: Try to connect with him with that.
there's now a comic about those web browser ponies
AJIsawsome thats how this started by me being frendly to him.
I was sitting next to him when he ouled out a sharpener blade and cut me.
I say just steer clear of the guy, if he comes at you, run into a crowd. He's not gonna stab you in a crowd.
a crowd is the best palce to stab him
he can slip back into it
TheRandomkid321: Yeah, then it's best if you stay away from him.
Nonono, if he pulls a knife near you, scream out at the top of your lungs "DROP THE KNIFE YOU CRAZY FUCKING BASTARD!" That's right, go all Canterlot voice.
I mean that way someone will notice, well everyone will.
Make them all crash!
They will...
YAY
How does everpony feel about my latest idea? XD
this trigun stuff is hilarious
That was.... entertsining?
they notice
but they won't care
Yeah, just go "AAAHHH! He's gonna cut me!!!!"
the'll all just clear away from him and let him get stabbed
if someone physically bullies you, you should say "no no no no, dont do that, you will give me a boner"
I would sooner wag then have to be in a room with him.
Bronysith: What?:D
lol, That's a good one Bronysith
Ok, revised plan. Scream "IF THIS MOTHERFUCKER DOESN'T DROP THAT GOD DAMN KNIFE I'M GONNA RAPE EACH AND EVERONE ONE OF YOU!"
I can't believe we have 93 people on chat right now.
no, no threats
EVERYONE*
people won't care
Empty threats don't get you anywhere
The worst bullies aren't the ones who carry knives. The worst ones are the ones who carry clout. The ones who can pass themselves off as the victim of bullying and flag anyone they don't like as bullies.
It's not like they won't notice though.
they'd notice
but again
wouldn't care
PinkuePry: yeah, but why call that sort of attention to yourself when you want the bad eyes to be on the bully and not you?
Ok imagine this. Everyone is sitting quiet in class and then all of a sudden you hear someone scream "THIS BASTARD IS GONNA STAB ME!"
Wait is all of this happening in school?
no some moron is saying hypotheticals
because some other fool is having visions or something
Booooone <3
no homo :P
awesome boone cosplays at dragoncon
"Don't sneak up on me!" saw him come through the door...
AdamTheDuck: nothing wrong with that

Chocolate_Chip: HellO! Wrek is.
*Hello*
Heya Chocolate_Chip
an NPA is a nasopharangeal airway
:o
wich is a rubber tube they shove into your nose with lube
like a mask?
ah
With lube O.o
it goes into your esophagous
and i cant spell
what does it do?
yup, sterile lubricating jelly
:O
What am I reading
Instructions from a medic :)
it keeps an airway open in a patient with altered mental status or who is unconscious
05clearly not medicine Rustymeat casue if you did you'd know that
I feel like I came in at the wrong time :S
05how so Chocolate_Chip?
Lyncast where were you stationed?
you think thats raunchy Chocolate_Chip, wait till i tell you about the crichothyroid airway
Wrek: well you're all talking about lubed things going into esophagouses and whatnot XD
dem medical terms :)
Wish I had alight
How about no, Lyncast?
lighter
you ready for this, because its really fun :D
hey guys
05Chocolate_Chip: not in a sexual ways so i cant see the problem

Lyncast, is it kinda where the neck meets the torso?
Troy: Hello!
I like Derpy shes pretty funny
It made me mad when they revoiced her what did you guys think about that?
go derpy!!!!!!!!!! :P6_9
Meh.. we still got the old episode
they had to
then you puncture the membrane, and insert a cric tube or a king LTD into the airway itself, inflate the balloon that keeps it in there, listen for spontanious resperations, then tape it down and if needed ventilate
cant blame them
):
and nope, its north of that part

Troy: Only when the mods air it. It's best if you don't ask for ponies.
Troy: Read the FAQ.
Troy: Well... because the mods are vengeful bastards.
Troy: Go to the hub there showing MLP right now

I was going to say evil, but that would imply I disagree with their stance on the matter.
<_<

Troy: On the weekends, we're theoretically open to Gen4 requests, but we always get Gen3 instead :P

05soem are gay some are bi some are straight and some are happy

;D
Theyre both good for me I have a bracelet that says brony
05but yeah dswv1ddswv123, you are welcome to stay as logn as you act nice towards the otehr users. afaik pink3 is not here

if my best friend was a brony,do u think that would begay?
Here here Wrek
Star0184: Watch it :D
I am
Wooo~
05dswv1ddswv123: of course not. being gay is a sexual preference and is not affiliated what type of entertaiment said person would enjoy.
dswv1ddswv123: Only if you choose to see it that way, but that's a pretty petty way of viewing things.
i'd say there's no point to being a brony, as you can't choose whether it happens to you or not
Wrek, truth.. here here
No your not gay for watching mlp and you are gay I have no problem
Troy: you're*
Sorry
There is a difference between sexual preferences and television shows.
Yes
AJIsAwesome: Haha
They don't have to be related.

Troy : then i am gay
I have a handful of guy friends that are into MLP and none of them are gay.
Maid_RainBow: Are you truly?
I didn't choose the Hub life
Pearly: You should probably spell "brony" right if you do.
Fun Fcat: You don't need to tpye coerclty to be udnesrtood. Olny the frist and the lsat lter of a wrod may be on a croecrt palce.
Holy shit guys, there's a thunderstorm a'howling outside

Madness PillowPoniCreeper.
PillowPoniCreeper: secret butt fun time :D
05dswv1ddswv123: nope, this is a threat: "I will casue you physcial pain"
Wrek: I was unaware that you were a female, let alone a gay one. This is news to me.

05whetheras "I will commist sexual acts to those that want me to" is not
dswv1ddswv123: (Don't worry, Wrek threatens everyone :P never follows through)
All men are lesbians :D

MadSurge: secret butt fun time? Why you no invite le creeper?
05sorry tSparx

Wrek: I'm not at all disappointed, haha. It would be nigh on impossible for the details of who you wanna have sex with to disappoint me xD
Wrek be flirting with le regulars, I see.
Wrek, ha my friend on college said that he was that too a male lesbian, since he likes girls and girls are gay since girls likes guys haha
in*
alexxm: Yeah, bad time to visit the chat for the first time
...
im back
05I guess im in too good a mood
05on a normal day id probably jsut ban the fucker for trying to troll
Parasprites are scary
05isntead i bucked his family
05hmm
Wrek: :D
whos trying to troll?
Well, when he pops in with the statement "bronies are gay," we assumed he was a troll. Now I just think he was an ignorant kid.
05aye
tSparx: Yeah, I agree.
yeah
Who tried to troll again?
Which is, I mean, still not fun, but hopefully we taught him something? idk
wrek=parasprite?
05"my friend is a brony, and internet says bronies are gay... but i want to watch the show too but I DONT WANNA BEGAAAY!"
PillowPoniCreeper: I don't think he was a troll, just ignorant.
Ignorant
Twilight is dissapoint
AJIsAwesome: Who was he?
Ibeen on;ine for almost 20 years and I still do not like the word troll..
<3
Wrek lol
AJIsAwesome : we've been getting those lately
PillowPoniCreeper: Yep. :D
Oh hey CCCP!
oh, well troll isnt the definition i use

i use cyberbullying asshole
Celest
Pearly why?
I think my eyes are going to fall out.
hai Everlasting_Joy!!! :D
Meanwhile, why?
As I tell my mother all the time, "I don't pick the slang, I don't have to like it, that's just what it means."
why I don't like the word troll?
Mr. and Mrs. Cake
Because I've been awake for 26 hours PillowPoniCreeper.
yes
Wrek: Well, internet trolls feed off of the niavity of internet newcomers.
/me Noms on candy apple and thinks about life
Fluttershy gave me Diabeetus
Meanwhile: your bed. It calls you. Go to sleep before you pass out on so
Something*
Wrek: In which the newcomers could be likened to babies.
I'll take one off your hooves XD
CCCP, oh well I sitll do not know why people do it... it's plain stupid...
Last song?:(
PillowPoniCreeper: No. Will wake up too early. Must stay awake.
Need...caffeine.
Pearly: They get some kind of "satisfaction" out of it
Pearly for the lulz?
Need poniessss
Meanwhile: You should've been here for Euro Movie Night. We needed you for D-Wars.
Mornin', manechat.
05hurrdurr
Meanwhile: a lot of caffiene isn't good for you. Probably explains why my growth spurt hadn't kicked in yet.
AJIsAwesome: Nothing can save D-Wars.

Troy: Go to YouTube. Not all of us wanna watch ponies 24/7, especially since we've seen most every ep multiple times
new to this stuff
My baddd

Troy: 'Sokay!
05if troy asks for ponies once more, newborn cuties for all! :D

Go for it, Wrek.
Well,
Troy: No problem.:)
Troy: But yeah, what Wrek said, don't make me watch G3 :/ haha
Wrek: :D
Reikim: Agreed, even with the rifftrax on Friday night, I was stunned and in pain from it.
G3 is scary
Everlasting_Joy: Oh good lord not even the Rifftrax. It is a SPECTACULARLY bad film.
hahah give me g1 but not g3
Troy : G3.5 is carierst
G 3.5 anypony?
Troy: If you ask for ponies, you will get G3. Just fair warning
You know a movie is bad when even Rifftrax can't save it.
Give Pearly! all the g1, leave me with just the G4
Can I ask for Fillies?
G1's okay, but not G3.
Troy: No just go to fucking youtube
Troy: No, that's even worse, then we might get... G3.5 *shudders*
Crowd surfn' like a rock star.
05ok queued neborn cuties

Although the wait for S3 is starting to give me nervous tics.
Ballad of the brony was astounding
Troy: Yep.

time to guess the crossover http://i.imgur.com/7BLbc.jpg
Rex_Mundi: its scandinavia, so probably
hehe
Is this Sabaton?
cowvarkian: It's Wrek streaming some metal band, Sabaten?
MLP_Brovakiin: Yep
It is.
Sabaton*
good band whats they're name
tSparx: ok, sure
wb Masdragonflare
What's the difference between the different theatres :o?
Ah cool, I was going to say Wrek already hooked me on Raubtier :)
alexxm: Sabaton.
Masdragonflare: Er, there usually isn't one, i don't think.
thanks Everlasting_Joy
thanks tSparx
You know, not many people pay too much attention to the bass. It's really adding some sinister flair to this song.
Masdragonflare: They are onlly there for movie night
Is this almost over?
Masdragonflare: Spike only has a stream and no chat, or vice versa, can never remember
Masdragonflare: Nothing as of now, but come back for the movie night and see.
I have to go to a place where lack accesse to ponies today, for the entire week.:'(
Star0184: doubtful
tSparx and Masdragonflare Spike has only stream, no chat.
Rex_Mundi: It must be awefull :(
Oh wait, I've BEEN here on Movienight and never noticed, what happens?

MLP_Brovakiin: Oh, i hate jobcorp, im still kinda sick too. So its gonna suck
tSparx: The side rooms open up. They also use these during new episode streams.
Everlasting_Joy: Side rooms?
Oh by the ways guys
I just want back to school again
tSparx: During the new ep, manechat is disabled and we are to use the side rooms. Side rooms are the pony rooms, Pinkie Pie, Twilight Sparkle, etc.

05good job
CrimsonPhoenix: I want to
Also, I need to listen to moar Testament.
05why would you tell people you're a brony?
im gonna tell everyone that im a brony by showing up to school in a brony shirt :3
05jsut be a brony and let peopel figure out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
05then it wont look forced
because most ppl already know
except my parents
so what
gunter_the_penguin I did and nobody gave a crap :/
05then you have nothing to say
it's not like you're gay or something
I know
Only person who knows I'm brony is my mum, and that's only because she caught me :0
@Wrek: amen
they'll just look at you awkwardly
ok guys
I agree Wrek
lil_b: aw crap :l
i'lllet em figure it out :)
05parents can be really theb iggest douches when it comes to being intolerant
and be like okay whatever
CrimsonPhoenix: Parents who aren't goons would. Parents who are would rip you up.
05so unless you know you're oparents dont give a fuck
05then sure
*Is sad because his dad is a goon*
05let them figure out
0,5Wrek is best wrek
05but tread carefully
/me hugs Wrek
my parents already know that im a brony :)
here's my story
i dont know what they will think
05bronies have been kicked out for being bronies
/me glomps BaconMane
I loved MLP
05jsut casue their parents were ignorant
Wrek: Yep.
Wrek: I've heard of that story, sad
Wrek: Bloody Somethingawful, eh?
I collect pics in computer and the episodes in my computer
Anyone remember that one story?
I have only told one person that I am a brony
one day I decide to buy the merchandise
05time to surround sound
AJIsAwesome|Homework: At that one place
when i became a brony i kinda expected a flame war from my sister
the brushables
Or
Nope
When I told my parents (I'm 20) they were both like "Ok, nice" because they respect that I have my own live and trusth me in what I do
my dad sucks he thinks being a brony mean your a pedo
Not link I wanted to post

My mom was okay with it, my dad needed some time but he accepted it.
This
http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/362
You know you want that hat.
and I told them to NOT spread the word, they don't have so far :)
maybe put some browser ponies on it
shortly during the day my mother saw them and asked me later "why did you buy those things" I said "The show is cool and I show my support to it" she was "lol okay"
when i told my parents they didnt care at all :)
that is it I know it's different to anyone but that's pretty much how you should do
AJIsAwesome|Homework: im might only put the mane 6 on it
05i fidn it funny how many bronies are self destructive
Wrek: I'm not a robot...that I know of
05AJIsAwesome|Homework that is if you are lucky
...Wrek. please tell me this is what I think this is.
Good morning, everypony!

The type who are unbearabally too brony because they are like "my little poneh rox umg witch it"
Serenity: Ah.
LadyCanary: im being tame over here
XD
Wrek: I think your PC could candle it
Wrek your computer will handle the 1080 but the capture will just reduce it
i have gen over
though I wonder how laggy it would be
05Serenity: im not worried about ym computer nor my connection
Serenity his net couldnt~
another song in this style I completely adore is "Maggot Brain" from Funkadelic
05im worried about mips failign to redistribute the data properly

Hiya SB!

Serenity: I didn't even see the point of the game.
Wrek: /)
05(\
The game has way to many problems
i really hope someone else in my school is a brony or when i show up in a vinyl scratch shirt its gonna be awkward :l
Serenity zeah... I reallz like Nintendo, but the recent Mario Games reallz were all between bad and meh...
who are playing, what band?
It's so easy, I beat the game in an hour, the new powerups were rare as rocking horse shit
05mentalyeffedguy: pink floyd
Serenity: Sure it's about collecting coins, but you didn't really have to collect them. Now this game demands you to collect them, and turned me off from it.
oh
And the white tanooki was OP as fuck
i like pink floyd :3
:) hippies :)
The biggest problem with the game is: It's as unoriginal as a CoD game
:)
gunter_the_penguin: if i wore that shirt, and noone else were a brony, the fucks wodnt have been given :)
I really don't like how they're making these new Mario games easy. It takes away from the challenge and difficulty.
Yeah, I bet my dead grandma could beat the game
The fact that there is challenge and difficulty makes it fun and adds more replayability to it.
So yeah, wasted 35 quid I coulda saved for a Computer
mentalyeffedguy: oh ok ;)
SuperBrony64 I'm still working on you Desktop Pony, but it's kinda slow atm, I wanna speak with Vordox (I'm still new to this and he gives great design Ideas and currently I'm stuck at one point :/ )
AJIsAwesome|Homework, yeah. We're watching SuperBrony64 play NSMBW, and that game's being a real challenge to him.
WHERE WAS SAXY WHEN THE SAX CAME ABOUT
Serenity sell your soul
11,02o.O
LadyCanary, in Gondor
gunter_the_penguin: i wish i had a vinyl scratch shirt....
Kandarihu: That game was brilliant, because it was toughshit
Kandarihu: That's great. I LOVE a good challenge.
Kandarihu: Motherfucker is probably busy doing fighting games stuff and hw.

Sumica: Hi to you too ^^
Hi Bronies/Ponies and Happy Labor day!
I beat NSMBW 100%, but it was VERY hard to get everything. That's why I liked the game.
00,10Hi Serenity
UHHHH. Oh my god this is lovely
11,02Dat Sumica
I can't do it, stuck on World 8
11,02I wonder why the server set those bans again...

-.-\
11,02i liek NSMB Wii :3c
00,10it's because twi server's ban list was not matching up
Too bad the co-op in th game is annoying. I had to stop playing co-op on the account of how tiring it was to be killed by your teammate.
*the*
... and dark Souls still doesn't work :(
hi pikachu

Oh, and then they play a song off Division Bell :3
gunter_the_penguin: As long as your cool about it, youll be fine. If someones says "You like MLP? in a mocking tone" simply respond "yes... yes i do". they cant really call someone out for liking MLP if you are upfront about liking MLP.
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink, and we mix it up, call it - sup Pikachu :)
05tSparx cant say for sure
ok, what´s your favourite episode? (I´m new so pls don´t hate on ,me for asking x3 )
Wrek: This is the "title" track for Division Bell, no Roger Waters :/ oh well
tSparx: lol
Luggen: mothertrucking sonic rainboom :)
Luggen: Tough call, but I'd say probably Lesson Zero (because crazy T-Sparx :P)
Shizuka -> http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/339
Luggen: S2E1
Luggen: Probably The last 2 of S2
I'd go with sonic rainboom 2 ^^ Love it :) goosebumps on my arms as rainbowdash breaks the barrier x3 *Silly fanboy screm*
hey =]
tSparx: You are the only one who refears to Twilight as T-Sparx
Rex_Mundi: Not true, I'm just the only one here. My BFF Tori refers to her as T-Sparx too :P
Rex_Mundi: I recognize I'm in the minority, but I'm honestly shocked that most people don't understand where I get it from.
And yeah Serenity i really like the last 2 ones 2 ^^ Pretty much love every episode :/ But sonic rainboom is my favourite to ^3^
Rex_Mundi: Er, y'know, can't figure out who T-Sparx is without me explaining it :3
Rex_Mundi: where do you get it from? ^^
Starship Troopers is the one with the giant spiders right ?
dat slide
giant bugs, in space
Lagship Troopers.
Ah yeah, "High Hopes," from Division Bell, by Pink Floyd
:)
lol, I had forgotten about that
Took me long enough >_>
Meanwhile otakon get admiral rank
05this is proper music
^
05jsutin beiber can fuck himself
05and he probably has
Admiral of the great lag fleet. Otakon "The Buffer"
OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
DAT DISS
Wrek: shut up! i love his music!!
Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands, and a huge part of my life 4-5 years ago.
inb4 kick
hi guys :)
Sup Eli :)
mentalyeffedguy: Just calm down. It's just a joke.:D
ok, here is one of the things i wanted to ask. I'm writing a song about fluttershy, got a nice melody nice tone but i lack the specific atribute of fluttershy which i want to build thelyrics on?
:)
So what aspect of fluttershy is what you find most important?
AJIsAwesome|Homework: not funny, hes my idol!
Doesnt get any better than Pink Floyd. Me and my dad listen together and sing in the car together
XD
tSparx: feeling beat. probs because i am beat :P
Luggen: Her hidden/secret badassness :)
tSparx Like when she's fixing the bears neck? x3 her hidden baddass?
hello
Wrek: Oh come on wrek, your not jumping on the Bieber hate bandwagon too? The kid makes music that doesnt appeal to us, thats true. But I recocnize the kid has actuall talent. Its Willow Smith that should get your hate.
Luggen: Yeah, or how she stands up to the lion, the dragon, the cockatrice, etc. Just like PInkie can get serious when she needs to, and Rarity can get kind and/or down n dirty when she needs to, Fluttershy can grow a spine when she needs to
TAKE IT BACK
<3
Luggen: I would suggest Fluttershy's timidness and gentleness. Also maybe her inability to control her anger when she lets it out.
I love this song so much ... *sings along*
Otakon "The Buffer" vas LagShip
05Rex_Mundi: CANT I HATE RANDOM THINGS WITHOTU GETTIGN CRITICIZED?
Wrek: nope
Wrek: LOVE and TOLERANCE :P
alright who wants to be next for me to draw them as a pony on gimp?
Wrek: critique to you!
Chat's derping, BRB.
i have school tomorrow lol
00,10besides it dont count as jumping on it when you helped build the wagon =p
that floyd?
Pikachu: Ooh, me me me!
05love and tolerate is more of a guidline when it comes to dealign with people than a rule
Yes Eli
05and yes sumi, that is truew
Eli: Pink Floyd (post Roger Waters), Division bell, "Take It Back"
tSparx: alrighty then what will ur cutie mark be?
and the tolerate part is horrible
Pikachu: I still don't know >_> <_< hmm....
just asking: are they still doing gigs? i'm not really informed about them...
Wow, tSparx. You know your Pink Floyd. Respect.
Pikachu: Leave it blank-flank and show it to me, I should be able to decide then :P
tSparx: sures
CrimsonPhoenix has a point. There are some people who just don't really deserve tolerance.
Pikachu: Thanks so much, it's awesome that you're doing this!
Pikachu: Thanks so much, it's awesome that you're doing this :D
AJIsAwesome|Homework, you say that because you read the article
LadyCanary: I'm a pretty big fan :)
CrimsonPhoenix: True, and also because it's a valid point.
hi all
Pikachu: are you a good drawer`? if thats even a word :P
Eli: Kinda.
tSparx: no prob i thought this will be super fun
I never understood the Bieber hate, the kid built his career by being talented and getting spoted on YouTube. Hes not a fake preety face that is no talent ala The Jonas brothers. I dont listen to Bieber but I know the kid desearves his fame.
And im back from unfreezing my laptop
mentalyeffedguy: eyyup
AJIsAwesome|Homework: if you roughly translate "tolerate" to "ignore" i think everytroll deserves it :)
Pikachu: i wish i could draw shits
i said hi guys
FlutterMEDIC: hay!
Eli: Roger Waters and David Gilmour have essentially retired into their solo careers, but David will sometimes tour with everyone from Floyd (except Roger Waters)
FlutterMEDIC: Hello!:)
She will take it back someday"
killerpony7733: im going to
and it works!
tSparx: k... i never was much into them. their music is great but i just love seeing a band live too much :)
killerpony7733: ill sign up affter im done
Hi, FlutterMEDIC!
Eli: Hah, I understand. Unfortunately for me, by the time I got into Pink Floyd (c. 2007), they weren't touring much and were EXPENSIVE AS HELL xD
Pikachu ah, well if you want another to draw to help you improve i can sign up for ya i got some ref of my OC
tSparx: See, I live in NY and there was a "The Wall" show to be played in July.
AND I COULDNT GO.
killerpony7733: no its fine im going to do it now i guess XD
tSparx I love the idea :) I'll try and make it as good as possible ^^
LadyCanary: That's a bummer :( Though, tbh, I think The Wall is their most overrated album
True, but really fantastic.
Any stoner bronies? :3
Pikachu ah so want my ref quick then?
uhh not me
hi
Luggen: I have been known to smoke a few times.
Luggen: not anymore, but i still have contacts if you need stuff :P
im only 15 :P
tSparx: I actually got a really cool Wall patch for my backpack.
Luggen: kids dont do drugs, mkay its bad....mkay
LadyCanary: That's cool :)
Yeah I'm in sweden :c But thanks anyways Eli ^^ And tSparx i love to be a bit laid back while watching ^^ Had some nice black afghan a couple of days ago :)
Luggen: I wouldn't call myself a stoner (it's far from the central facet of my life), but everyone else does :3
bronystate just changed to google for me O_o
:D
metnalyeffedguy Yeah xD
And its thundering
:)
CreeperPillow: Jealous >_> Where at?
Luggen: hilsen fra norge :)

Luggen: i think i could send it that far north-west :P ...it wouldn't go through the controls tho
does anyone here have steam?
tSparx ^^ In sweden we say "Du kan vara en brukare, utan att vara en MISSbrukare"
It´s like you can be a user without being an OVERuser :3
Luggen: I'm a bit of a linguist, but I'm afraid I have no idea about Swedish.
starship troopers is an A movie
yep it is Pikachu
Eli it might ;3 But i have a steadu dealer close by so :) no worries ^^
kk thx :)

MLP_Brovakiin: i dont like robbaz hes no real viking >:(
Seaponiesofliverpool Starship troopers is one of the best Scifi films i've watched :)
mentalyeffedguy: fair enough :(
I think my house is rotting :
tSparx: Car
who watches game commenters? just go and try the game yourself :)
dat Stephen Hawkings
Luggen: Prelude <3
stephen hawkings album debut!!!!!!!!!!
Eli: I do. And I play most of the games they're playing already.
Your no real super sand
tSparx: Have you ever seen an anime called "Silver fang" Or Ginga nagareboshi gin" ?
Eli: I watch speedrunners and Let's Plays of games I don't have access to.
stephen hawkings new album, do andriods dream of electric chairs?
Eli: CORRECTION: I've PLAYED most of the games they're playing already.
Luggen: Nope
tSparx: ok :c Where from btw? Country i mean :)
Eli: Plus, it's nice to see their take on the game and how they play it.
Division Bell by Pink Floyd, ""Keep Talking," featuring samples of Stephen Hawking
Luggen: Midwest USA, you?
i never got watching live preformances on youtube, Because their not live anymore, the quality isnt perfect and the croud can be loud, why dont we just listen to like the studio version
Eli: But overall, to each his own. You don't have to like them if you don't want to.:)
tSparx: Sweden :3 Nordic parts ^^
i don't actually play many games. from time to time i take a game and finish it, but i rarely have time between school, reading and other projects :)
CCCP: Sometimes the performance is better than the album version. RUSH is particularly good at outperforming themselves on stage :)
05Luggen, close to Umeå? :C

if something can go wrong it will ?
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1895/
Or there was another
"Any Colour You Like" /Dark Side of the Moon/
Who is your favourite?
I think so as well Luggen
Applejack
what, my ban cause a stirrup?
05twilight sparkle all the way
Luggen, that's no question
Luggen: Applejack for me.
Ah
I prefer Finagle's law.
Luna
Luggen: Pinkie Pie
also Rarity is best pony
It states that "The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum".
Buytoast: Nope. No one noticed until Wrek Said somehting.
lauren faust is best pony
Luggen: I am in a two-way tie between Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie (T-Sparx and P-Pie)
CrimsonPhoenix there we go!
scootaloo is best chicken
Twilight Sparkle.
:3
Far stronger than Murphy's.
Crackle is best dragon
I go for rarity, but applejack has barely little fans
tSparx Yeah i like twilight to, But i feel closer to rainbowdash in my personal style :3
if your favorite horse isn't yellow quiet, i'm more dissapointed than usual at you
Peewee is best Phoenix.
Luggen: But there isn't a pony I hate, and I like everyone but Trixy (Trixy is meh in my book)
yeah i know it adds "at the worse of moments"
I convinced my brother in watching MLP
/me likes trixy
today :)
Masdragonflare: How was his reaction?
cowvarkian: And that is your prerogative :)
Trixy is just missunderstood :c she needs our support to be able to meld in with normal conversation
CrimsonPeewee is best Phoenix
He was very busy working for hish school and I told him dude you should totally watch mlp
I was watching MLP the other day and my little brother said that it was "Okay." CLOSE ENOUGH!
Ah, no.
he first laughed
I think I'll use this name for a little while
tSparx: Nobody likes Trixie except Sethisto
ah yes
Finagle's law is more powerful than Murphy's law for other reasons.
CreeperPillow: Plenty of peeps like Trixie
CrimsonPeewee: You should.:D
Lord Dragon Rider of Dickington should not be challenged
nor should you mock Trixie in his presence
also that one is O'Toole's
lol
Specifically, it does not state that the worst thing possible will always happen.
Trixie is just missunderstood.
but then he said he was gonna watch it while he was going on vacation in Spain (where he is now) where he will be watching it
would use Philomena but I ain't a girl
*You're
"Brain Damage" /Dark Side of the Moon/
tSparx: True....but she's just tame comapred to Diamond Tiara. That filly is just...eeeeviiil
YESS
CrossChop114: https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/23/1rGl_uU1F0KaEUy828Z0MA2.png
hi
Finagle's Law allows for things to go right so that they will go wrong even more spectacularly later.
DiamonTiara is best villain
ello BoltzThePony
She's the only one that's re-occuring
I don't dislike any of the characters on the show, to be honest. They are who they are, and that's fine by me.:)
think about it
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw
CrimsonPeewee: thats not how you spell kefka
lol
even M.A.Larson agrees
"Any colour you like," (prior song), "Brain Damage," (this song), and "Eclipse" (next song) are often called "The Dark Side Suite"
murphys Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong
Bronysith, I mean in MLP
haha lol @ petrified_Discord
finagle Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment
Petrified_Discord: :D
Or just collectively reffered to as "Dark Side of the Moon"
O'Toole's The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum.
CrimsonPeewee: you said best villain, not just mlp villain, she isnt even a villain, just an antagonist which is against a protagonist
Lies
"perversity" and "worst possible moment" are basically the same thing.
Aku is best villain
Group hug! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1073/
Eclipse played at the end of the Olympic opening ceremony :D
But I'm doing research right now to look at it.
05http://e621.net/data/38/1e/381e38ce317b7382d89b197273f3a5df.jpg?1346699607
05NEVER
Petrified_Discord: Uka Uka is best villian
Ah
ö
Wikipedia claims that "Perversity" is known as the "O'Toole's Corollary"
alright, kefka may be the craziest and loving villian, but he didn't really destroy anything, maybe rough up a few continents and made orphans, but not that much
I wub group hugs. I always get squashed in the middle. Curse my short stature.
Wrek just linked inapropriate material? :D
tSparx: “I have heard enough of your shallow wisdom. It is I who is the strongest, and it is evil that will ultimately prevail!”
What? My username is in use :c
So it's not a law on its own, it's a corollary of Finagle's.
Inte me, Regular luggen
05Luggen: give it am inute, then use /nick
And Finagle's is also a corollary of Murphy's.
So all three are the same thing.
and finagle's is a corollary of murphys
"Eclipse" /Dark Side of the Moon/ (Unofficially, Dark Side Suite, Part 3 of 3)
But then, this is Wikipedia, so take it with a grain of salt.
sweet pink floyd
yup
better than tropes
Nom
hahahaha :D
is this the whole concert
Ok, yeah who exept me loves the music of TheLivingTombstone? *Fanboy*
Nom
I just saw this funny picture
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-even-spider-man-knows.jpg
Luggen: I do.
/me does, Luggen__
i love the living tombstone
Luggen: I like some of his stuff. I remember the first song I heard from him
@_@ Please dont link stuff during stream.
Hey
HEY
I like ALL of the brony musicians. I just some MORE than others.
:p
but but it's not live?
Tropes is quite good when it comes to media.
Shizuka : can i have some Cider?
Usually.
I love Tombstone
Masdragonflare: MUCH better than the original strip :D
haha :p
I'm going to be one of the greatest of BronyMusicians
If it's something popular then it will normally be quite accurate as a result of the collective squabbling of every nerd on the Internet.
Tombie is good but i love Alex S is best pony
wow, I just finished watching this concert on youtube
Nom nom nom nom Ow! Bit a Popcorn Kernal.
LadyCanary: You can link stuff during stream, so long as that stuff is an image.
now I come to bronystate and see it again ^^
Truth is, after all, a side effect of conflict.
ekips1: Welcome back!:)
^
Less popular things get less attention and thus languish.
Luggen__ have any stuff to show off?
Example of the former: ponies.
My cat is acting retarded ._.
ello ekips
the world is flat was popular
Hm?
PinkiePieSwear is awesome. I love 'The Astronomer's Almanac To All Things Astronomy' with Makkon.

"If it's something popular then it will normally be quite accurate " the wordl is flar was popular knowledge
I love it when bands do that
dken2021: But how?
flat*
"Wish You Were Here" /Wish You Were Here/
dken2021: xD
Ah

Luggen__ just click my name twice or something
Wrek be smokin'
05both definitiosn ai assume Rain?
"If a work of media is currently popular on the Internet, or was so in the past, then on the site known as TV Tropes all or most information on it will be accurate to the extent of the current pool of common knowledge."

Or Chrysalis.
Damn, I wish I had some money for that, Shizuka
Shizuka: I've seen that... What is the Black Mesa Source all about?
CrossChop114: Because the universe is cruel
CrossChop114: That would be awsome:D
CrossChop114: Desktop PONY, man :P

tSparx: Spike's there :(
tSparx: They have Zecora on desktop ponies.
@tSparx, Friggin' Iron Will is a Desktop Pony.
tSparx: And Gilda
Spike is best pony
13BMS is a mod that rebuilds half life 1 from scratch in the source engine
13it's half life source but much better
CrossChop114, I don't know why there isn't a Discord Desktop pony. Ask the people on the ponychan thread.
Petrified_Discord: AJIsAwesome|Homework CrossChop114 Le joke, peeps, never let the truth get in the way of it :P

:3
I originally got it for the free hat, I'll be honest.
What're we watching?
Although I've had some fun times playing it.
a pink floyd concert
compeutor derped
It's a concert I think It's from pink Floyd
So what do you think? I'ma link it one more time http://imgur.com/w84Iv
Good / Bad?
I haven't even gotten the hat and I've had the game since it came out.
luggen it's nice
âgreed
What
@luggen, It's good. :3
How does that even work?
Do you play violin Luggen?
Did you not play it?
all of those lights!
I don't know what it is, but it'
Your cute mark says so :)
Good drawing
it's well done
/me applauds
but why is your face red
I did but I think you need to do an online mission for it and whenever I tried to go online it crashed.
lol brain damage concert
/me Does the same thing
good concert
Huh, that's odd.
I dont play violin but I've been playing guitar for 12 years :)
i never found someone online
Forever a T.
ohhh it looked like a violin :)
I mostly just draw on Flipnote Studio. The low quality doesn't really help, but it's my only way to make my art public right now.
Frankenhooves?
Well, if Trix downloads it, I can run a server.
ingwas: It's me and my friend :
I think you're blushing
CrossChop114, what about GIMP?
Although it'll come darn near to burning out my little laptop.
:p
on the picture that is ^^
luggen, would you mind explaining the.....oddities of these ponies?
wrek I have a question
05i cant feel ym ears
05oh well
Hell, I've been looking for other people to play with for ages.
05hope you enjoyed wreks concert mareathon
I want to learn how to use a freeware art program. I really want to draw Flutteros
crimsonpeewee: what? x3
Wrek excellent
Thank you Wrek!!!!!!!
I've got literally one other friend who plays it, so we got screwed on most missions.
ingwaz I think he's blushing
@Kandarihu: I have Photoshop and 2 other softwares, but my computer is busted. I need a new one unlike this one which won't work with my tablet.
I probably would have, but I arrived at for the last two minutes
Wrek, thank you for streaming
Clearly we all have to go play it now then.
(before the question) thanks, it was awesome Wrek :)
Face-raped by green, stabby aliens.
This could work
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Feel up to reinstalling AS?
ingwaz: My face is generally red x3
Very nice drawing but the color scheme is quite horrible
luggen: oh? I tought you were blushing
that is a nice shade of red why not the whole body?
/me daribot
will do but it will take a while
meow
luggen: that particular part just seems kind of off considering ponies have fur. i dunno, its your oc so if its what you like and want, its good
Stallion_of_War: Paint Tool SAI, go now, it's so freaking easy.
np
masdragonflare: Yeh I'm not x3 the reason to me being red is that i don't blush :'3
Fluttershy's comb is perfect for my goatee
Meanwhile can use the time to GET SOME GODDAMN SLEEP.
someone shoudl stream the new doctor who episode even though it was terrible
luggen, why not the whole body red?
Is nothing streaming right now?
If I go to sleep now I'll wake up in a year.
he didn't make it CrimsonPeewee
it's a very nice shade and that could fit more
hey everypony is anything streamin'
Meaning I'll have missed the game.
his friend did
Cuz i didn't want it all red? :)
Unless T has really slow downloads.
I think he said that
You should still...take a nap, or something.
but it looks very very odd
Although it could be worse, at least you're still coherent.
nice to be back again
I didn't make it and she who made it is awesome ^^
hai Bunny_Striker
We need some music all up in heeyah.
sup
I've never seen a pony in the show with two seperate colors for the coat
Doesn't pip have two colours?
Wrek I was on a Meetup recently, and the one hosting it said he wants to make a international Meetup in the future, he already contacted People in other European countries
Hey everypony

Looks it doesn't remember my past kicks
Wrek I thought it would be a good Idea to use Bronystate to find some more people from other European Countries to help
Haha, 0 kicks = success :P
:roll
I know DCD has a habit of kicking me for no reason because he feels like it
and the chat pauses on my fail.
Personally that mental image is adorable.

It's odd that my sunburn is now peeling. It's healed already.

I though we established the inherent danger of getting anywhere near 4chan's genitalia?

It was along the lines of "Wouldn't you be scared of getting some sort of disease?"
And then you said
this that gundam show?
DoctoDoctorWho: caramels
Otherwise, I'm enjoying the intro.
thought so...
DoctoDoctorWho you don't recognize Caramel from the show?
"I'd be more afraid of losing something than picking something up."
Or something like that.
Sounds like something I'd say.
Something to do with teeth.

I remember someone saying that.

BerryPunch speaks to themselves in the 3rd person

Since my laptop broke, I've only been using Flipnote Studio, which has so many limitations.
DoctoDoctorWho: NO!

Wizard Riding a Unicorn on a Rainbow in Space so much win http://derpy.me/jdSI7
It just buffered for a long time, then skipped to dialog
Oh well.
So I'm scrolling through this newest DrawFriend
Suddenly I see a saucy pic of Twilight making out with Celestia.
i already get to watch robots kill eachother every day of my existance
...
Walking away from that now.

Yep. I'm back, and I'm still dry

Yep
I`m still a bunny
Ah.
I can't read this! *tableflip*
then i have to rebuild the blue one
I remember it was pretty much SFW stuff only
/me hugs CrossChop114
meh, since you can't read it, I'll skip past it
/me accepts hug.
Caramel: we are all peasents as we cannot read japanese
They usually hide sauciness behind links.
Except for that one time that had an image swiftly replaced with the words "I thought it was mud!"
Hello everypony
Usually this consists of ponies in lingerie.
sup Obsidian
Needs more explosions! KABOOM!
Yep.
And then sometimes stuff slips by.
so we will all stare at lyra instead, yay illiteracy!
I remember once a FlutterMaid plot got by and never got commented upon.
I've been playing Dragon Quest VIII. It's a damn good RPG.
Me know no Japanese
hi Obsidian :)
they used to hide the nsfw stuff
hi
At the same time, a merely semi-saucy pic of Vinyl and Tavi got hidden.
That was back when I used to go on EQD. I haven't touched that site since earlier January.
how you doing Obsidian
Super Robot Wars? That's what it is?

Honestly, EQD turned shit.
