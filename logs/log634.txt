Apparently it's required that all full body prosthetics for females be fast, hot, and insanely underclad for anything practical.
And then something about muppets.
That's all I know of that particular franchise.
Rather random.
Hello everypony.
13Nothing :(
13because we can totally do that in a few minutes!
Chick-fil-a??
The muppets withdrew support for the place because they wouldn't affiliate with bigots. Or something.
The only thing I accept about McD's is their 1$ drinks.

lol
Go in, buy a drink, sit.
13the chick-fil-a thing was just an overreaction

You won't die cooking.
Blame it on the pop
would that be a good way to describe it?
something about a promise to never forget.

I'm writing a story. I've been stuck on the first line for half an hour.
Wasn't really blue.

A blue moon is when a full moon appears twice in under a month.

She's 98% synthetic

ALSO, if she ever quit the organization
She'd have to forfeit her body

Since it's mostly governtment property

Fanservicey...doesn't cut it.
I just don't see the logic given their line of work.
13came in ninth place in the lyrics writing contest?
I am incredible math :+
besides a female android is a Gynoid IIRC
how IS she when she doesn't surf?
13well for that scene at the end, it's an effective distraction
Surfless.
O/////O
Resistance is futile.
and she's underestimated a lot
13just the brain in the braincase
...ERRMAHGURD BABBIES
13she's otherwise 100% prosthetic
13yup
but I think too much clothing interferes with the active camo systems they have
13but that's just a case of taking the brain out and putting it back in
For that to work you'd first have to be staring.
0,14well, yes, but you also get a Sigh-Borg :3
In other words a full body cyborg-- ala Robocop, but nicer to look at.
yes
13well the active camo they use the full body suits
13sort of
And if you're in that kind of scenario and that's all it takes to distract you a loud noise would probably also work.
Um
Er
in the movie it's the android, and some clothing
Okay
No it's Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini
*the android body
Ahaha

OOC?
13in all seriousness i need to get one of those blindfolds..

00,10I used them alot on the train
13rarity got some good distance on that with a casual toss
Dat music
Uhm....
Anyone else.....
i think i shall follow in Kirz's footsteps...night everypony
You sure do quiet a lot.
I can't hear the voices :(
13YEAH TOAST

Only background mudic
music
Back groun music
I see.
*ground
13back grown music?
13ew
fandubs?
You guessed it.
I like this.
00,10the point is no one ever enjoys the music and other foly work that is done
13dubs, appreciating the bgm, translations
I do
The music is actually brilliant, in a sublime way
13http://i.imgur.com/m39l8.jpg

if you listen hard enough, you can still hear the voice acting
cereal + carrots + eggs + saucepan = fried eggs
logic
seems legit
its like something from a feature film Direct-to-DVD looney tunes movie.
Don
00,10many dont even realse each pony has their own theme music
This background music is pretty good.
^
00,10I can never pick a best CMC
Vaccume
twist is best cmc........ wait
00,10Colt_Silver, it usesly plays when they first show up
Twist is most underrated pony.
Vorpal
it needs more cowbell
13this needs something.... like... fine motor skills...
This BGM only things made me appericate the show's music even more and gave me another reason to like it
Pinkie pie style.
my primary function is failure...
00,10they even do things like ajusting the echo
13yeah it's not easy at all to strip out vocals only
lol whats wrong?
00,10but the echo effects of a room are in side tracks
:3
13ah
Oh!
00,10so basicly you hear the voices bouncing off the walls
00,10you wont hear it as much outside
This show has the best facial expressions ever
And drum roll.
^
ded.
oh
00,10notice you cant hear them now
I see.
13ah now i can tell
13ded
00,10the echo effect is even ajusted based on the type of building they are in
G'Night guys.

00,10Kinixys, if you type out part of a name
00,10then hit tab key it auto compleats the name
are the voices for everyone else ok or does it sound muffled?
I wish I could play a banjo
I guess Fluttershy likes my idea.

05oh well
Oh he's back
05ohai welcome back
http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1895/
Or there was another
"Any Colour You Like" /Dark Side of the Moon/
Applejack
I prefer Finagle's law.
Luna
also Rarity is best pony
It states that "The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum".
:3
Far stronger than Murphy's.
I go for rarity, but applejack has barely little fans
yeah i know it adds "at the worse of moments"
/me likes trixy
today :)
he first laughed
I think I'll use this name for a little while
only have one thing to say to everypony: http://i1100.photobucket.com/albums/g404/sub06905/yourbanned.jpg
nor should you mock Trixie in his presence
also that one is O'Toole's
lol
Trixie is just missunderstood.
would use Philomena but I ain't a girl
*You're
"Brain Damage" /Dark Side of the Moon/
YESS
hi
DiamonTiara is best villain
She's the only one that's re-occuring
think about it
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw
lol
even M.A.Larson agrees
finagle Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment
Or just collectively reffered to as "Dark Side of the Moon"
O'Toole's The perversity of the Universe tends towards a maximum.
Lies
"perversity" and "worst possible moment" are basically the same thing.
Aku is best villain
Group hug! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1073/
But I'm doing research right now to look at it.

05NEVER
ö
Wikipedia claims that "Perversity" is known as the "O'Toole's Corollary"
05Luggen: give it am inute, then use /nick
And Finagle's is also a corollary of Murphy's.
and finagle's is a corollary of murphys
yup
hahahaha :D
is this the whole concert

Is nothing streaming right now?
If I go to sleep now I'll wake up in a year.

Unless T has really slow downloads.
I think he said that
You should still...take a nap, or something.
but it looks very very odd
Although it could be worse, at least you're still coherent.
nice to be back again
We need some music all up in heeyah.
I've never seen a pony in the show with two seperate colors for the coat
Hey everypony
I'm back from crazy Cry of Fear shenanigan
but then again they made it fitting
Well that's going to go up pretty quickly.

When I get tired...weird things happen.
Hey!
Hmm. Okay

You were the one to do it, if I recall.

Yes.

Wat?
I have been kicked 0 times
I have a shitty memory at the best of times and I'm currently sleep deprived which curiously does not improve it.
PSP? :D

Und dann Val, allo.

heya
Pokkymans

who's OC?
13what
It was along the lines of "Wouldn't you be scared of getting some sort of disease?"
And then you said
this that gundam show?
Otherwise, I'm enjoying the intro.
"I'd be more afraid of losing something than picking something up."
Or something like that.
Something to do with teeth.
Robots! :D
lots of them
Unrelated: I taught Manechat how to do :kickcount. Shameful.
Back to le craft of mines.
Shamefur dispray.

/me accepts hug.
They usually hide sauciness behind links.
Except for that one time that had an image swiftly replaced with the words "I thought it was mud!"
Hello everypony
Usually this consists of ponies in lingerie.
Yep.
I remember once a FlutterMaid plot got by and never got commented upon.
