I want to smack the people who started pissing and moaning about black history month.
TOY_PON3: oh you follow him too?

Oh god. Pinkie's A Game.

dat A GAME
>make a black history month infomercial >only has one fact

Stop calling Pinkie a kid!
Cranky doodle went to town ignoring all the ponies, Pinkie walked up sang a song and now he's not so lonely~

Kammerjunk: exactly

XyroTR1 usually streams his encoding and uploading of the hi-def version.
nightPhase4
then how are you on here
and I have NO way of checking it from here
Well I have to give the new episode 8.5/10 because I love the songs but it was pretty random, plus all the animation shifts
Bad luck otakon, though maybe now you'll learn not to run your internet on depleted uranium.
Pegasister16: was it the namby pamby stories?
i'm still waiting for ep 17 in 1080p
Night, Pegasister16

^
Well when you say "night" and leave out the name of whoever you're saying night to it's easy to misunderstand.
Well, I've had a terrible headache the entire day, but this episode was worth it.
Now to enjoy this episode for 2 weeeks.
LordDerpington: but what if i want the episodes on my pc?
I BLEW IT D=
lets see, Read it and Weep can describe becoming a Brony, Hearts and Hooves Day can describe shipping, and the new episode can describe trying too hard to convert people to Bronyism and failing
Tovler: I can't wait.....
08,01oh poop, i forgot about the pony episode
I was saying Nitey-Nite to Phase4!
IshBestPony: except it leaves the part out about failing
Gumri: well, Apple's attitude is "tough luck". :(
IshBestPony: except for the ending it would have made sense...I still think the ending was phoned in
Will Iron Will be voiced by Will Smith? I guess we'll find out.
IshBestPony: It makes sense..softof
08,01guess who forgot about the pony episode today...
Pinkie technically succeeded in converting him in the end, even if he's still an introvert
mhmm therefore i am forced to get it off youtube
seriously it would ahve been such a better episode if it was the mayor...
emangamer: you just annoyed that it wasn't the mayor.
If the itunes versions where 1080p and not infested with drm I would happily buy them
Omg ep 21 sounds awesome
08,01meh, time to wait until it's on youtube...
mfw the rooms decrease by 300+ people each in less then 20 sec
emangamer: You still mad?
Besides, didn't you see the Mayors husband during Smile smile smile?
Meanwhile: and you're saying it wouldn't have been a better episode?
08,01hey otakon
emangamer be mad?
Daring Do
emangamer: Yes. I am. That'd be daft.
08,01Dken2021: wooooooooo!

Dayum Tom 0_____0

Applejack was in this episodeâ€¦ not that it matters anymore ;-;
Tom: why would you kill wour fun like that?

Hospital is very boring
I AM SO ANGRY
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I OVERSLEPT
inb4 it's only been one minute
is there a reason a new episode isnt airing next week? i dont understand tv schedules sometimes
Tom doesn 't know? wtf
I consider that a good thing. Season 2 will end later so we don't have to wait as long for season 3
... where was Applejack? I think I missed her
well they DON'T have tv
Dermathil: Sorry to hear that
Dermathil: ep was awesome
She was in the song, NullRadix
IHAD A SEPERATE FUCKING STREAM UP
OK GUYS
also, please someone tell me they didn't fking mute the mane chat again
There are replays on the other streams

Inb4 2 month wait between seasons.
AND MY COMPUTER CRASHED
DERMITHIL HASN'T SEEEN IT
Derm it was amazing and you missed like the best thing ever
That was a pretty good episode.
Dermathil: they did
FOR TEN MINUTES
NO SPOILER MODE IS ACTIVATED
they did Dermathil
Dermathil: sorry buddy.
I NEVER SAW IT
05,15yes Dermathil Mane is muted during episodes
Applejack has been in every episode this season, well minus hearts and hooves day
HALFWAY THROUGH
Why is rd reading out loud?
Dermathil: I had the same problem with last weeks episode..
Dermathil: it's only regulars and mane6 rooms atm
Because she can't read in her head.
RD: Iknowdatfeelbro.jpg
Spoilers include titles according to LC XD
dat loud reading
I am so angry right now :'
applejack and scoot need more love
And nopony cares!
I hate mosquitoes.
StinkomanFan: Why?

NO SPOILER MODE IS ON GUYS...BE WEARY
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so very true
GODDAMN IT.
I already real aloud, it helps me not skip words. Plus I love hearing my voice. It's so fabulous.
no spoilers...
my session is about to end in 10 minutes
this sucks
I've been ranting about it for the past MINUTE
You're right StinkomanFan, nopony cares.
[SPOILER] Rosebud is the sled
Well, i'm gonna catch some shut-eye before work
otakon: We will miss you :(
Later everyone.
If I read out loud I can't remember what I read
So if the mane chat is now going to be closed for episode times, guess I know where I WON'T BE COMING BACK NEXT WEEK.

See ya Placebo

ping ping ping..
Pegasister16: eeyup.
There's no reason for me coming back to watch episodes here. It is ruined forever.
Im not yet dead XD
My stream DIDN'T FUCKING WORK
:D
otakon, I said NEW episodes.
I didn't even think RD could read
Nerd~
Dermathil: surely it isn't THAT bad.
NEEEERRRRRRRDDDDDDDD
Im not leaving, emangamer, in his hatred for me, implies that I will be banned
also, mods, just telling you this: YOU FUCKED UP.
So the past 3 episodes have been dedicated to bronies? Awesome.
StinkomanFan: Sorry to hear that...
XD
I am 6 Eggheads ~Exeggcute
Gumri: Indeed
and Meanwhile: YES IT IS.
/me <3s being an egghead
And Sumica IGNORED ME ASKING FOR HELP
:(
Mane chat was too fast to hold decent conversations during live premieres anyway.
This is the WORST THING EVER since I joined Bronystate.
Dermathil: calm down and register your complaint on official channels
I know XD
Pegasister16 is best egghead
what Dermathil ?
StinkomanFan: I'm ignoring you being ignored when asking for help.
Yeah what otakon said
otakon, THIS IS AN OFFICIAL CHANNEL.
/me is flattered =3
Derm calm down xD
05,15Dermathil so sorry we can't cater to your every whim
Humpty Hump is best egghead
Dermathil: If you must cry, cry
it's okay
Don't tell Dermathil to calm down, he can't.
I understand what you can and cant get banned for
/me does the humpty dance
Just let him work it out on his own.
Dermathil: I mean email them with a concise organized NON raging letter on why this is a bad decision
And then when I got to a different stream My computer crashed!
what's wrong Dermathil ?
FOR TEN FUCKING MINUTES
fluttercry: at least learn to listen to the goddamn complaints from the important members...
/me joins Tovler
so much rage >.>
Dken2021: he's upset the manechat is closed on the weekend
RPG Shooter. whut
/me joins Pegasister16 and Tovler
05,15implying we rank viewers by importance
ginormous is NOT a word
Gumri: he ment RPG, Shooter
05,15Eveyone is just as important as the other
^
0,5^^^^^
^
of course he did. I'm an idiot :P
except for the staff
/me plays the Humpty Hump song from her iPod
I am practically bawling here because of how much the universe HATES ME
also, whitney houston died
Damn, the Humpty Dance never gets old
slowpoke much?
Dken2021: that's old new I'm afraid
^
Then listern to them lc!
well I dinn't know
Who's Whitney Houston?
whitney houstoff then ?
Tovler: Nope'
0,5Who says we dont listen to our viewers?
Whitney Hoofston
And the only one responding to me Is Meanwhile! The biggest dick alive
gospa; singer
LordCelestia: Except that you guys actually have authority
LordCelestia: Attack them
I say you don't
but I see what you mean
damn it
6 minutes
Stop saying who's whitney houston. My arms are sore from flipping my table.
bye Gumri
StinkomanFan: no one else cares enough to mock you about it.
I ASKED SUMICA TO FIX MY STREAM FIVE TIMES LORDCELESTIA
see ya Gumri
FIVE FUCKING TIMES
I'm not going anywhere?
My father just gave me the "what the fuck are you watching this for" speech
05,15StinkomanFan it's not his fault if he can't make it just happen
eh. Cyall friday next week. Even then I'm not sure I'm going to show up. Because this OBVIOUS BULLSHIT is 100% crap. The chats are STILL going to be slow, and mane chat is the funniest of them all. Also, I DONT WANT to login on all six sidechats to read what everyone has to say about shit.
Should have asked a sixth time dude
StinkomanFan: YOU are supposed to refresh if that happens. NOT Sumica
08,01emangamer: go on...
/me pities emangamer
StinkomanFan: Wait till Eurostream
StinkomanFan: exactly what do you expect Sumica to do about YOUR stream?
I TRIED REFRESHING
08,01what was your response?
0,5Calm down!
He didn't respond!
08,01and what was his response to that?
StinkomanFan: If you must cry, cry
It's okay
At all!
05,15Or you can suck it up Dermathil and be a big boy
0,5God forbid we can't snap our magic fingers and make everyting all better
emangamer: I got that same speech from a few friends of mine recently I politely told them to fuck off
0,5God freaking forbid
ouch..
Im in an airport loungre right now. Noone give a fuck about what im currently doing XD
Dermathil: it's a little unreasonable you know, manechat is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to track on premiere days
Big_Jakeintosh: don't think there's a polite way to do that.
So I had to go to a different stream and guess what happened then?
Good answer thought.
My computer crashed!
Dermathil: but it'll be back up for the weekday
otakon: heh. I can still read it.
THE HOW ARE YOU ON IRC?!?!
*then
Loud noises!
Y u watching ponies? You should be watching Walking Dead or Breaking Bad.
For ten minutes I didn't get to see what happened!
08,01i don't listen to our viewers.
This chat is so intense today
also, last week it took over an hour AFTER the premiere for it coming back up.
Meanwhile: its not to hard you just gotta choose your words properly :)
08,01well, that's a lie, i do
Big_Jakeintosh: I assumed the words were "fuck off"
08,01<3
Yea I'm just, "get over it" and he's just like "you eventually need to grow up"
I was talking to StinkomanFan this time otakon :p
oh
I believe the words are DEAL WITH IT
Meanwhile: lol no not exactly
emangamer: no you don't. Stay grown downed forever.
My dad does the same thing about videogames emangamer
dat same snore
Dermathil, just cool it man
Just tell me where I can watch the episode so I don't kill myself
08,01emangamer: i think i'm living proof that, in fact, you don't.
So many weird faces in this scene
?
08,01most of us are
05,15Dermathil we made this change to spread out the load. When everyone congragates in mane chat, it's almost impossible to keep up
You have to grow up in some ways, but not others
youtube ?
alright well I'm going to go everypony...
bye
see ya later emangamer
Seeya emangamer.
hopefully
later emangamer, hopefully everpony cools down when you come back
Ã±ater emangamer
The mane 6 rooms should always be open
Bah, "grown up". It's more grown up to not care about what others think of your viewing habits.
emangamer: PLEASEDONTLEAVEME!
TOY_PON3: one can only hope
^
bye emangamer
oh earlier... I thought you meant at that instant XD
lol
LordDerpington: exactly
Pegasister16: :( I'm sorry...
0,5Alright
/me hugs Pegasister16 goodbye
Well i'm going to go now everyone. Bye!
heres hoping my internet turns back on today when I get back
and fluttercry, I been around for longer than you have. you have NO IDEA what kind of changes I've been around to see. And the mane chat is the most important feature of bronystate, almost as important as the movies. Removing it is just like making the movie nights a chatting night.
0,5If people dont stop complaining
/me rolls out of chat
0,5right now
/me hands Pegasister16 an emangamer cardboard cutout.
0,5iom muting the damn channel
I'm just so angry :'(
bc I'm about to be disconneted
LordCelestia: Please...kick them
LordCelestia: putting the smackdown on some fillies
/me hugs emangamer "You'll still be on the Xbox later, right?"
indeed
Hope you can make it back for movie night, otakon
me too
who's complaining im not
hopefully I will...IDK when though
Dermathil: you do realize it goes a mile a second right? impossible to have conversation
I'm not either
^
/me hugs LordCelestia "calm down my old friend"
08,01can i just say: this change to chat was discussed *at great length* in our last meeting. some of you don't seem to see the bigger picture here that *most* people do not like 100mph chat
bye guys
Derm honestly? Stop pretending like you have the right to a mane chat. The mods can do whatever you want and you can complain, but you're acting like a child
I have 50 seconds
I might have been complaining :p
Seeya otakon
BYE!
later otakon, take care
bye otakon
Take care otakon
tbh
I say let the mods do what they need to do to keep the chat orderly
bye otakon
I for one well the changes that are coming in the future.
See ya otakon
later otakon
05,15Dermathil I don't care how long you've been around. Things change, it's not that big a deal. You can't hold a conversation in mane chat at those speeds
And I can't frigging talk to my parents about it, and the only person who listens to me was Meanwhile, a man who lives eats and breaths hate
I would've complained but I didn't sleep in tday
08,01if you do, well, i'm sorry, but we've had to slow thing down, for ease of moderation, and to make chat a more pleasant experience for the majority
egh. Apokalipse, that's why I'm not coming back next week for next episode.
StinkomanFan: you've totally got me all wrong.
also, have fun watching the episodes. Cyall next movie night.
I never paid attention to the main chat during new episodes it was impossible to keep up with
Good, problem solved, hapiness and smiles now, k?
I'm not coming here next saturday morning either.
see ya Dermathil
I don't hate everything, I'm just incredibly sarcastic.
later Dermathil take care bro
eeewwwwww
Im not going to be on for a whole week :(
/me appreciates Meanwhile's gift
Just when I thought I was going to be able to like pinkie pie too
Pinkie Pie amazing.
indeed
08,01to be perfectly honest, we know that this change is not going to sit well with everypony. we've accepted that, and have still made the change. on the whole, it's working; most people i've spoken to seem to like it more this way
StinkomanFan: I understand you're disappointed but you didn't need to take it out on the mods and the chat..
I wonder why Derma feels so self entitled.
You will love her. We all love Pinkie Pie
OverKillTrap.jar is a-go
Pinkie Pie is everyone's friendâ€¦ (is it safe)
and suddenly the room is ded XD
Does this doctor have a name yet?
/me 07,01hugs BSR
This room is fuelled by drama
/me hugs Luna

I'd have nominated it for B movie, but it's 4 hours long
I cleared my cache and It still won't work
because she is climbing in your windows snathing your people up
we've seen 4.2 hour long LOTR movies here.
That was a special though

That was the best August ever.
Not sure if 4 hours of Bollywood would fly as well as LOTR though
Try it
Probably not.
first book of the series, 3 place in the shelf
Okay seriously last night Chrome failed on me and now it works..

http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/5/50/647Keldeo.png ogod, I can't stop staring at his plot.
Have to say, room Twilight was pretty witty, as befits a room named after Twilight Sparkle.
I hope the rarity room likes bananas. ;)
07,01if you want to see Samurai Jack please refresh your browser :)
fine brb
It just plays may the best pet win
I only hear a song.
Which is good as well
07,01starting soon :)
It has great sound quality
you shoudl totally let the song finish first, though >.>
but I also have to go obsess, create music, eat apples, and do other quintessential things that are awesome as always it's been an honor and a privilage to share my time with y'all bai everypony
Okay.
Owfin, glad that some good came from nearly killing my client by hanging out in all the channels during the episode.
;)
So the final episode of Jack will be playing?
Episode of jack what?

OMG LUNA

Silly Owfin you shouldn't say Candleja-
Candle Jack... gods, wasn't that from Rocko's Modern Life?

*has never seen this show in before and is probably going to think it is cool*
I wish I had MLP FIM toys and stuff but I feel embarased what people will think
I thought that was comic sans
plus.. I have no money of my own
People USE DIFFERENT FONTS
Comic Sans is the one twelve year old girls use
that is overused font of doom
COMMMIIICCC SANNNNSSSSS
Yay!!
Papyrus is also ooverused
Papyrus is the one that companies use for logos
Finally saw the episode
WE ENJOY USIGN THE ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE

NO SPOILERS
That's good.
Lke a Boss!
07,01No spoilers pls
not realizing that most actual graphic designers freakin' hate it
i didnt like the new ep so much
You mean Hearts and Hooves?
/me hears wind go through BSR
._.
first Craig McCracken, now Genndy Tartakovskyâ€¦ c'mon Cartoon Network :(
Samurai of Arabia
I liked the newest episode
alexxm, shhhhh
hi alexxm!
Thanks for not spoiling anything guys
Not spoiling anything but I am kind of disturbed by Big Mac now
"I liked it," or "It wasn't as cool as some of my favorites" are not spoilers
That ain't the newest episode
Too bad there's no cars in ponyville.
They could drive Mustangs!
^
sorry i just asked what people thought of it no spoilers there
Now hearts and hooves? that was funny :D
StinkomanFan: Next time try not to get so upset..you really did piss off the mods
we saw this episode already.
Reading Rainbow
0,5Spoilers go through the day
I too loved the new episode. Pinkie will kill us if we spoil the fun for some people.
Not everypony was able to catch the newest episode
0,5cause people miss is
0,5*miss it
Sorry mods
What is the newest episode?
It's a pinkie pie episode
I dont know the name
And i'll leave it at that
I want my fluttershy episode damn it
The episode on today? :D
Ahh, discussing the episode right after it airs seems like such a logical thing to do though >.<
Yeah, we need a Flutterhy episode badly....
I'm not ready for a Fluttershy episode.
It is for the first half an hour
or so
Does anypony know if you have to have MW3 in order to download the multiplayer on Steam?
When will the stream show the new episode?
post cute on Bronystate :3 http://iwsmt.littleasllc.netdna-cdn.com/February-16-2012-19-16-10-XhNZv.gif
Smurai Jack is so awesome
In 2 hours 30 min
*Samurai
Not if the free weekend is still going on
Daaawww
And when will EQD post it?
About that safe time
Same
Bagh
dont worry, everyone looses a game of monopoly sometime
Well great, now I feel bad again for pissing off the mods
?
Is there no dialogue in this show?
It says I can download multiplayer but I don't know if you have to buy MW3
It's been a rough weekend.
when you play momopoly, we all lose
or is this just an ep without much?
I never lost a game of monopoly... probably because I never actually finished a game of monopoly
dont buy it
I just lost the game.
Apokalipse, same here XD
dat jockie sound O_o
no one has :(
It just takes so long xD
Ihave won The Game ^_^
You don't need to have MW3, as it's a seperate game
The Spring Season of this episode was my favorite.
I liked the episode, that's all I'll say :)
I'm not gonna buy
obsessive leaf collector
thanks desertman2
only in Wajas
huh, its broadcasting in 5.1
I learned one thing from the Last Roundup
I'm looking forward to the next one.
well I'm out
Never ever fucking break a Pinkie Promise
Which was?
Oh
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
She will find you
You shouldn't make a promise unless you're willing to die to keep it
I loved the reveal at the end of that episode
whats this guy doing
that's why it's a promise
07,013 march if i'm not mistaken
me pays Vinyl Scratch to do awesome DJing
I mainly watched the episode for Derpy
Pinkie's â€¦ damn, no spoilers
/me pays Vinyl Scratch to do awesome djing
I am still confused on the whole pony genetics thing
I am so mad that nobody cared about applejack... that episode confirmed everything I suspected about Applejack's flaws
/me wonders why it aint working
Nuuuuuu!
its simple using punnet squares
I cared about Applejack
wait, what? That she's stubborn and a bit racist?
Oh, well, more time for Fanfic.
racist?
Derpy and Flim Flam just drowned out AJ
Lol,how
That she tries to be the perfect pony
Really hard
Everyone's a little bit racist :D
flim and flam are my top ponys
They all do, they just have different ideas of what a perfect pony is
07,01dat avenue Q
I'll be off for a while, toodles everypony
I'm pretty sure Twilight is a perfectionist
:( but I'm not racistâ€¦ I'm a freak
Flim and Flam reminded me so much of that monorail Simpsons episode
Somepony doesnt understand the meaning or racist
Yes, Yes it is @Luna
this guy is strange
did it for anyone else?
08,01hey guys
see u CountDoofus
But she is really focused on being the perfect pony that everypony loves... I love that kind of thing
Hi
08,01i've got a (non-mandated) anonymous survey i'd like you to fill out about the changes to chat: http://kwiksurveys.com?s=LINLFO_deb0bea4
I think I have my episodes mixed up, I was thinking Over A Barrel
Oh
XD
08,01i'd *really* like to hear your opinions on the changes
So did Hasbro ever explain why Derpy became the way she is?
Nope
wasn't it a animation error?
Oh yeagh
at first
08,01your responses will help us in the next staff meeting
I thought you meant backstory
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO I MISSED IT!!!!
So can anyone explain what the symbols by peoples names mean?
dont tell me what happedns
like the +,%,@ mean
I want to know if Derpy was always supposed to drop an anvil on Twilight's head.
are they status?
@ is operator, % is half-operator, + is voice.
I wasn't here before the new chat, soooooo no idea what the old one was like
Fuck your well
I never noticed the new chat, XD
can any one send me a link to the latest ep?
Hehehe, I've got status >D
The chat changed?
Usually means mod and stuff
Reknowned, Feared, Loved and Wise
please
Can't wait for pinkie episode
Just... not in your City >.>
need applejack song
bob it already aired
The synopsis for the Fluttershy Episode is interesting
hmm, This chat looks the same, eh dear brother of mine?
The pinkie episode was todayu
Yo'
Ironside tries to help Fluttershy be more assertive
I want to see that episode
That oughtta be fun
The twilight episode looks interesting as well
I loved how nobody expected much from Secret of My Excess and it ended up being the best of the season.
08,018,1hey guys

Spike Episode will destroy fanonâ€¦ of something that doesn't exist.
But it was soooo obvious >.>
But it was soooo good
I didn't expect much from SSCS6K, but it's one of my favorites now
What was that?
The best episode was last round up
When is the spike episode
Did Lauren Faust have any involvement with Season 2?
I didnt see it
Nope
Silly ponies Spike is rainbowdash
...
I thought Last Roundup was kinda downhill after Derpy
Lauren was involved with the inception of Princess Cadence.
What is SSCS6K?
I gotta say, though, this Samurai Jack thing is pretty.... uhm. uninteresting.
10,02See you all at BMN!
Nice music
Last Roundup had a moral that hit close to home.
I'VE BEEN SPOILED BY HOW AWESOME PONIES ARE, OKAY?
Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000
Yeah, great moral
I haven't seen the new one yet NO SPLOIERS
Bye for now SB
I think i saw somewhere that lauren had different ideas for Cadence
darn, I forgot to spam "grond"
there was even going to be a sea ponies episode i recall
can any one send me a link?
I loved the reveal and moral of The Last Roundup, just not the buildup

Okay um I seriously need to know if I should down load that game..
So who voices Pinkie pie?
yep. Genndy Tartakovsky for Season 4 please.
SORRY

*hides*
Owfin, did I not see on the chat about there being 4?

Why do you want to if you already have it?
who is the milkman
True..

This is Hard boiled as hell.
No spoilers please.

what is the milkman conspiracy
Anyone know who Pinkie Pie's VA is?
05seriously this is an epic episode
Lulu, sweet thing
what is this show?
Isnt that Fluttershy's Va?
Yes.
Yea
But then Lulu became Luna. Things just weren't the same.
both are the same person.
i always wear a red shirt with red hoodie and a red pair of shoes
Shannon Chan-Kent for the singing voice.
What i find amusing is Luna Eclipsed was going to have a Rarity segment
Applejack and Rainbow Dash are also voiced by the same person. Rarity's voice actress also voices Luna and Granny mith
Smith
The Rarity segment would have had a Pink Luna. strange that hasbro cut that.
and Derpy
The voice actor for trixie did a good impression of Celestia
Cana nyone tell me where to signup for the newsletter?
PM a mod
Talk to Luna
Dat emotion chip
the lulz, if you will
From what I've seen I think Laura did not intend for Candence to be a Alicorn
She didn't
Why she is a alicorn I will never know
who is candence?
pew pew
Stuff Blowing Up
i like the music
Wait what? Derpy?
How are little girls gonna care about a wedding between 2 nobodies?
We're robots. Robots with cars!

Heart shaped tongue

*toy

Is that supposed to be a trumpet!?

Trumpets only have 3 valves.
The Princess Cadence toy looks like pink Celestia
2 handed trumpet
alexxm, fashion!
dat sudden cut

I am a pink Celestia?
Name Princess Cadance
I miss Lulu. She was the best mod
/me checks self and coat is white

i want to be able to reload like that
this looks like that old XP screensaver
She took alcohol with Xanax.
really?
He sure is noisy for trying to sneak around
Well sure he is a robot, but still
What if those pipes had posionous gas?
never take alcohol with that stuff ever.
he's a robot
Shoot everything that moves!
Owfin he's a robot won't bother him
I know but it would bother Jack
Intruders must die!
shoot ALL the things
and everything that doesn't
Jack is immune to poison
Shoot everything that DOESN'T MOVE
the guns are sweating bullets :)
Tovler: you can't tell me what to do i do what i wan't!

:'(
08,01and i've fixed the ambiguous question
So that's why Lulu changed her name to Luna
Aw.... Jack feels bad now
You just killed a good guy
You accidential bastard
08,01cheers to everyone who pointed that out; i'm a derp <3
hhnnnnnnngggg
MOOD WHIPLASH
mood whiplash
Man the Samurai Jack episodes have alot of sad endings
I thought the sword couldn't kill good guys
05but he wasnt a good guy per se
Rule of drama?
05he killed alot untill he retired
Guess robots don't count.
Jack could have helped the robot
hes a robot it had no soul
Aku YOU BASTARD
Young Jack in Aâ€¦ Atlanta?
What is a soul?
the saddest thing is that it the series ended without ending
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KVVq3IySA&feature=related
That was good
The music is also great
05Take care of Lulu.... sweet thihh...
I also had never seen this show before
I'll keep that in mind when Luna becomes Lulu again.
RIP, X9 and Whitney Houston
Owfin: I'd never seen it, but I knew the very basic plotline.
Samurai Jack --> Princess Celestia

It's so obvious

Dashie: What about Fluttershy crying?

unfoundbug - in all fairness, this episode was a Rosebud episode ever since we got the synopsis
one of us one of us
true
however i never read the synopsis and there are probably others like me
also: not a mod so dont take what i say too literally
Plus apparently the song was released

even 1940s Hollywood thinks this is too African
I dont get this part... how does a samurai student end up at a tribe like this?

Bronyfied- they're going to teach him in combat
but the everyone already watched the episode
dangerous words wrek
ikr Wrek
Yes Wrek.
his dad was killed and magic?
i havent seen the episode
Rosebud was his sled
but... by a tribe that are far away from the samurai tradition when looking on the location?
Jack's Dad was still alive
I think that Achilles Kills Hector is like the Snape Kills Dumbledore of ancient literature

good to know
Rabbit trolls
DOOM BUNNIES!
08,01the amount of traffic generated even by 100mph chats is negligible
Jack gets rabies. The end
two seperate entities
Yes Gold.

Let go of it!
I just remembered why I don't like babies

Bye mari
cya mario_pony
=_= This dub is killing me.
lol
durr
/me 07,01hugs Tovler
:o
I'm still perplexed that I, a 90s kid, has never heard of this show.
IMDB says the movie is coming out in 2014.
so, today's ep was adorable to an extreme that I'm not entirely sure how to express.
I watched everything, Even Matlock and Rockford Files.
it was dazzling :P
The narrator makes it that much better.
DAZZLING! ;)
not really, working
also, today's Derpy spotting was the most bizarre.
but occasionally
ya dat derpy XD
how did she ever get into there !
only Derpy knows
I might get killed if I don't smile and love the episode.
"Like Sean Connery!" wut
suppose I could... move some windows around maybe...
i just dno what went wrong 6_9
"THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!"
Sean Connery was in a Michael bay movie ~White History Fact
oh don't worry, i was just asking
sorry everypony
07,01Sean Connery is awesome
we don't like nobody. dat grammar
nah, if I keep messing with windows maybe I'll get frustrated enough to actually spend money upgrading my setup
08,01episode... was AWESOME
08,01i LOVED he smile song
08,01it's SO AWESOMe
*wub face*
A gun?
Sean Connery IS awesome, it's just such a random statement. XD
sean connery even awesome when used in parody
I want a Gun Shiro
08,01did anyone notice how the smile song was based loosely on the tune Yankee Doodle?
I'm sad everypony
you're planning on upgrading your pc?
But now we gotta wait 2 weeks for a new episode. A Fluttershy episode, no less! :'(
kidzrul434 why ?
It's been in the back of my head for... a while
Wat?
how come
I have issues with spending money
I missed the new episode of the MLP
08,012 weeks?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAINy8MQa4&hd=1
:)
thankfully we'll have Avatar and Samurai Jack episodes to keep us companyâ€¦ o wait
yup, no episode on the 25th. dunno why
kidzrul434: it's up on YT now. GO WATCH IT IT'S AMAZING IN WAYS THAT I DON'T HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS
Yeah, I noticed that too.
I probably would have bought two new monitors wednesday if they hadn't sold out by the time I got home
wat
ok thanks
Because of this episode, I want to know everything about everybrony ever
but I need a new video card that supports 3+ monitors... which probably means I should get a better mobo to support it... and that just kinda cascades into everything
08,01CountDoofus: i did not
How long is this
huh. never mind me then
don't you restream the episode after BMN anyways?
oriental riff
i don't actually buy anything unless i really need it, also i don't have a full pc, most of the time i'm just in my laptop ._.
The narration for this cartoon remains quality.
08,01bmn is in an hour
08,01oh, yeah, maybe
New episode will be after bmn
08,01i'm not sure
What did I just return to? What on Earth is on the stream?
08,01i'm not usually awake then
08,01let's go with "yes"
and if you want to watch the episode anyways, the 1080p is on youtube already http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfAINy8MQa4&hd=1
Samurai Pizza Cats
see, that's where I'm at. I would certainly *use* the extra monitor space, and sometimes I wish my computer was faster... but it's kinda hard to deny that a new setup would be a rather large money sink
regardless of the fact I most certainly could sink the money
Hmmm. How different would FFX have been if the main playable characters had been Braska, Jecht, and Auron?
I think I vaguely remember this show existing, but I never watched it.
I don't even remembering this show existing
Or maybe I'm thinking of something else
I don't even know
too busy watching Rescue Rangers
if you are going to use it, and you do have the money, i don't really see the problem, as long as you make that inversion worth the money
ah... but how do you know it's worth the money? There are "sales" all the time, and it's not always easy to figure out which parts are poorly made or not
08,01woah, lots of channel noise
08,01i think this is my new favourite pinkie face: http://i.imgur.com/rBqna.jpg (don't worry, no spoilers)
08,01
only some of them seem painfully obvious
Suddenly, SlurryMoon.
3Oh gosh, I hope that didn't flood the chat
3mIRC derped hard and wouldn't let me connect ><
08,01it did, but we still love you
Hmm, Pinkie pie has moved up to RARITY TIER, with rarity
Only know that feel once SlurryMoon but don't worry much about it.
3:3 I wub you too
I dont get it
brick and mortar stores, in general, are overpriced. Newegg is nice but mail order... I like at least having this concept of "I go here to talk to someone"
Animal androidsâ€¦ don't let Jack run rampant here.
those animal droids makes derpy look like brain surgeon
ORâ€¦ Dr. Robotnik's been busy winning.
Holy 80's song parody! Borderline!
those girls sound stupid
poor 4th wall
but.. derpy is a brain surgeon!
???
lol 3d beard
Man, this anime was dubbed fast.
i don't like mail order stuff, too mcuh trouble, yet it's true, sometimes it's cheaper than anystore
cant wait for the next episode...greetings from germany ^^
greetings
how can this cartoon even be accepted into CN?
07,01@ Kuzuha you missed the ep.. but don't worry we will re-stream it after the movies
movies?
when is A movie
ya movies
07,01in 45 mins
ZYou're in for a wait! LOL
thx Luna
oooo
cats ok

Kesk it's a cartoon, you were thinking of reality
:) thx otakon
np
Well midweek most side rooms are asleep.
and then he went hungry
how do you type to a person?
dat shameless plugging
eeyup
07,01try /me
Luna!
I guess I wouldn't know, I assume it's not necessary midweek, but is useful friday night/sat morning/eurostream
O.o
but it's not eurostream yet
/me hugs Luna "You weren't here for last night!"
07,01that is correct
only broken arms?
07,01but i'm here now :)
thats better
yep, Slappy Squirrel is still the greatest female cartoon character ever.
eeyup
/me prepares the tactial crazy bomb
Not for 23 minutes anyway.
God I love this show
ALSO
likewise
Animaniacs is 19 years OLD!
same here
So am I.
orly?
eeyup
well I'm 27 so I was....
8
oh hey know i rememver the iron giant!
jeez....
I'm 28 this year
07,01Animaniacs never gets old
^
lol
Luna: it will NEVER get old
oh, this joke
I feel so damned old
LUNA!!!
dear WB, please put this on Netflix
otakon: I was born when you were like, 10. Do you feel old now?
robokun: agreed
I agree with Luna. :P
Meanwhile: yes I do
luna coming at 11:30
I am bookmarking this place
Mission accomplished.
you skyud me
i hate being sick -.-
there comes princes celestia
Otakon if it makes you feel better you're still 2 years younger than me
if not at least release dvds in the uk
kidzrul434: you should, they show all kinds of stuff
fail 1
fail 2
fail 3
I am wondering why lune only appeared in one episode during season 2
Ponygirl_82 was born in 82?
yep
call me dotty and you die
lol
hence the '82' in my name
what
squeeze cheeze
Dot looks good as a blond
I want the cheese
The execs hate Luna. It was a struggle to even get Luna in that episosde
lol
I LOVE
derp
THIS SHOW
musicals everywere
Chevrolet. Sure.
I like Luna.
i like sun
well
Who could hate Luna, she is awesome
So forget about Luna. Look at the pretty Cadence woooo
writers were of a better creed back then
PonyGirl_82: holy crap your older than me!
I like trains
lol only by 2 years
yes
Tovler But Luna had been through the fastest rehab ever seen, a good morale could be learned from it... like rehab is possible
I still want to know who Cadence even is.
nightmare moon, luna, woona
king fear
But Luna has boy colors. That's weird.
Bronyfied: yh, she made a COMPLETE comback from being evil to good in a year
DAFUQ???
"Boy colours"?
STAB
Colours are genderless.
BOOM!
lol
swag
so youre saying a giant muscled dude weaing pink is a girl???
I still think Luna was 'cured' too quickly, she would have made a better 1st season villain the ponies had the deal with throughout the 1st season not in just 2 episodes with magic jewelry
also
is it safe
all them blacks and dark bluesâ€¦ look at the pretty Cadence. Isn't she faboo?
mayo
discord should have comebacks as villain
Mayonaise, poison, same thing.
Well they had to show off the elements of harmony
fuck you mayo is awesome
agreed Sundaysmile
also hiya lol didn't notice you were here
PonyGirl_82: maybe and I like mayo
I shall retire
hehe
I like cheese
lol
muted stream to watch a Family Guy episode, come back to see Animaniacs

DJ-P0N-3: Iron Giant
So, I need help with irc clients. I'm on osx and I need a client that a) has automatic scrollback markers and b) can strip all these color codes and stuff. I tried xchat azure, xchat aqua, colloquy and mango irc and none seem to do the trick or I'm just too stupid to figure it out.
?
String_Shredder: pointing at the comment above.
LunarKing: hopefully
Gotcha :tiaface:
String_Shredder: really it just means you agree with what the above comment is

05,15richfiles I can't help but feel that's an innuendo

what is rainbow dash made of
Not sure why Trixie gets more hate than Gilda. Gilda is far more deserving of it
/me beats emangamer into a coma.
Pinkie Pie = Rarity = Twilight > FS > AJ > RD
Gilda is a douche
is the new episode A Friend Indeed?
i mean she can actually going through a sonic rainboom
Trixie gets hate?
dafu?
i dont think trixie does usually Midnight_Fire, gilda is unanimously a jerk
Yes, Hazard3.
trixie is pretty well liked by some groups
so about how long until lotto?
trixie is that special kind of hate
kewl!
Gilda should die
Muffins: yes. lots of it.
Yes Muffins Trixie does get hate. Because Trixie is a cumbag.
gilda the whore wins
I mean Scumbag
T__T

08,01Bronystat's mascot is Nicolas Cage
05,15Lol Meanwhile
Meanwhile: good lord
http://derpy.me/hcr1y
Im still confused how Twilight had no idea that Celestia's pet was a pheonix or is the pet neewly recent
She's that to, but I meant scumbad.
Trixie the firemare is best Trixie! :|
this is the episode where pinkie pie changed from stupid annoying pest to maybe not totally unbearable for me
2,14 of course, even if it wasn't, I'd still agree <.< >.>
which one is Gilda again?
After Twi
oh
wait
08,01otakon: no, it's Nicolas Cage.
spike already broke the fourth wall
05,15Bronystate mascot is Indian Stallone
scumbad? what? fuck it I give up
that assfuck friend of dashie's
08,01RAWRity: yes. yes, we are.
that beotch
Pinkie is best engineer
TheGreatAndPowerfulT beat me to it
I'd say that Philomena has a LONG lifecycle... Twi may have NEVER seen Philomena at the end of a cycle
Pinkie is best inventor
The thing that bugs me most, is that despite the fact that Trixie is a complete and utter douchebag, people still like her. That is beyond stupid.
Gilda yar newb.
o-o
08,01we should make Nicolas Cage Honorary Admin of Bronystate
oh god no
no
NO
saw the new Ghost Rider movie... and honestly, I almost fell asleep
2,14 Meanwhile: AMEN BROTHER, SHOUT IT OU!
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
u DAAAAARREE mess with pinkie
2,14 out* even
XD
damn it so much LAG
Im sure there are several more times Celestia is a troll
0,14...it seems discussing Trixie causes people to typo
T'is the day for typo's hm ValtheJean.
XD
08,01Meanwhile: she's pretty, and funny in her stupidity
Celestia is NOT a troll
luna: could you boost the volume up a bit?
05,15Meanwhile....best typo ever
god damn Pinkie
2,14 it is...it really is
poor pinkie
no one except gilda ever got guitar riffs
true
She sure acts like one sometimes
I like how they troll celestia at the end of this one, though.
Trixie is a Dbag... but she appears to be a self conceited LONELY pony... She needs to open up and accept friendship to change! :) :|
08,01Meanwhile: stuck up bitches are funny to laugh at. they're ocmic relief. gilda, on the other hand, is just plain mean.
u jelly pinkie?
2,14 the only thing trixie "needs" is to die in a fire
just call her a bitch! you did that to rarity!!!!
I want more Trixie, Luna, and Vinyl...
Thing is, if she changes, I'll like her for not being scum, but people who liked her for being scum will be annoyed because she isn't scum anymore.
Gilda is the best
What's the best pony ever
Trixie needs a hug
Pinkie Rage!
:|
Meanwhile: true
05,15What about Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon?
08,01ValtheJean: in another episode!
d
IN THE NAME OF CELESTIA!
d'awwww*
Fuck Diamon Tiara and Silver Spoon
Diamond tiara and silver spoon can go play in traffic.
Diamon tiara is worst than trixie
thats alot of jealousy
08,01fluttercry: they don't have as much humour value
fluttercry: DT's father and SS aren't too bad
worse*
THE FUHRUR OF EQUESTRIA
Tiara can rot. Spoon seems to have a kernel of goodness in her.
oh no, this is the part where Gilda makes Fluttershy cry. pasuing stream!
damnit
Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon should be forced to fight to the death. Then kill the winner
lol
Run granny run!
Don't Want!
with stolen food
pausing* even
xD
my GOD so much HATE from bronies
Seriously, I'm not a fan of trixie. I think she's concieted and egotistical. But that is nowhere NEAR enough to warrant the unadulterated spite aimed towards her.
08,01Midnight_Fire: that's horrible, but it made me laugh
I hate those bitches
silver spoon can win from kindness
I like Trixie
Thing is, DT and SS are both what, 6 years old? They have more potential to grow and become better people, and look how you all reacted.
she will give it back
what ever happened to love and tolerence?
08,01also, hey hey now, bronies shouldn't hate
Them returnable apples O_o....
idk about Gilda. She hogs her (only?) friend jealously, generally acts out against society and is so insecure she can't even tolerate some party pranks. Maybe she got issues.
08,01we all love Diamond Tiary, right?
too far
Trixie is a grown mare and a complete dirtbag, and you stick up for her.
RAWRity: shes just tsundere, thats all it is
08,01even thoug hshe's a massive beeyatch.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu, noooo
07,01how dare she!
Granny Smith: Braves the Everfree Forest AT NIGHT by HERSELF....is horrified of "rattlers"
I still think silver spoon is just a lackie of tiara
so much hate from everyone ._.
10,02>eats it
O_O

Nobody makes fluttershy cry and gets away with it! :[
10,02>'She migh give it back!'
Hey SuperBrony64!
silver spoon is
tomorrow we'll have chicken for lunch
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know man, but THIS PART!
THAT did it.
10,02Sounds legit :D
:(
Kill this criminal! Idiotic bitch made poor Fluttershy cry! That's the most diabolical crime ever!
GET ME MY SWORD
fluttershy!!!! :'(
T.T
08,01IshBestPony: we'll love and tolerate her, and hope she becomes less of a bitch
derpy looks mad
Fluttershy can handle herself.
08,01it's the brony way!
is it over? no more crying Fluttershy?
DEATH TO THE GRIFFONS!!
DUM DUM DUUUUUUM DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM!
SB64: She'll give it back in about 24 hours

WE ARE HAVING GRIFFIN WINGS FOR DINNER!
If u no wut i meen
For the FLUTTERSHY!
08,01RAWRity: but she always gets he come-uppance
I'm in the mood for some griffin cupcakes
Party! :$
Fluttershy will never get a back bone until you stop molly coddling her.
dont condem all griffions just gilda
welcome back SB64!
otakon lets eat the whole griffin
Meanwhile: but
So rare.... pshh... theres a reason for that...
good god
08,01RAWRity: well, true
BUT SHE MADE SHY CRY!
this ep is awesome
...
and NONE are allowed to make Shy cry
ahh age
NONE
Fluttershy death glare.
All the Griffons were eaten for making Fluttershy cry.
MI9000...in mythology, griffons eat horses
otakon: And that's why Fluttershy needs to take a self defense class or something.
lol
a year ain't much
and the Pinkie Pie opened up a line of restaurants called PFG - Ponyville Fried Griffon
DUN dun DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
oh god.... imagine if someone made fluttershy into a prankster...
:3
oh yeah well dont condemmm all of them just gillda
Gilda's gonna keel joo.
08,01i'm gonna sing a song for yooouuuu
Fluttershy would be the sweetest prankster
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
RAWRity: we dont have that. just those griffon steaks from new years
Troll Pinkie! :$
I'm all for sticking up for people who can't stick up for themselves, but it does more harm than good if all you do is wrap them in wool and bubblewrap.
guess what!
Meanwhile: she's getting that in the next ep....which we are NOT getting until friggin March 10th IIRC
yep, no new episode next week
BUBBLE BUT
yay gilda
Tom: you have FAILED me
Gilda eats shit for breakfast! LOL :D :O
She could try
MARCH 3RD
otakon: March 3rd according to listings.
Actually
Kill it with fire!
no new episode next week?
I thot it was the 3rd of March O.o
that sucks ass
Humiliation conga
08,01sonicrainboomer259: sssh, it we don't reference it be name!
Hazard3: eenope
and the week after?
boom
Gilda's gonna keel joo.
you know how EVERYONE complains about the The Mane6 not really "sticking" to their element? Fluttershy ALWAYS sticks to her element
does anypony think we'll see Glinda again?
NO NEW EPISODE NEXT WEEK THIS IS THE WORSR. POSSIBLE. THING!
me too
uh oh mod fight
Personally I could care less if Gilda neever comes back
And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day...
Fluffy Gilda is still not cute
/me hides in bunker
She is so unlikeable
I agree, MI9000 T.T
/me rings up your home number.
otakon: eenope. Best Night Ever
gilda is too cool for ponies
And the next day
08,01well, feel the sting of my... party poppers!
And the next day

RAWRity: okay, ONE time but she was frustrated is all
*calls Meanwhile on the phone*
And the next day
/me 11,01explodes
And the next day
every party needs a pooper, that's why we invited you, party pooper ~
and I'm sure as hell not counting her discording either
KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
vermin in the cake
thoes candles don't work that well
/me sweeps up Nittany_Discord into a neat pile
didn't work
05,15Nittany_Discord you exploded all over the cake!
08,01ValtheJean: partypoppers? poppers you do at a party?
08,01wait, that came out wrong...
Squee
2,14 -_-
and then Gilda started a war on the dragons. many lives were lost.
08,01especially considering my... alignment.
*uses super glue to put Nittany back together
Spike in the cake!
11,01And it tastes better as a result.

The cake has been spiked
Chaotic good?
rUDE MUCH?
Gilda's a jerk, no doubt. But have you ever tried to talk to a friend you haven't seen a while when they're surrounded constantly by people you don't know? It's a mess.
05,15dat...white space
08,01i'd like to make it clear now that i've never done any kind of illegal drug
stupid capslock
YOu guys know what ValtheJean said when he was asked if trixie was best pony?
they teach little kids to associate e-guitars with evil
that pin the tail line reminds me of "its twilight sparkle's ballon!"
o-o
I DISAGREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
08,01i've sometimes been very, very drunk, though
wrong way,retard
Nice stache
Trofl.
O_O
watching the new ep right now
I think I'm gonna have a nap after this
lag
dafu is going on over there?
2,14 strange, I figured I'd say something more harsh like "Burn that psychotic bitch"
Man down!?
too much lag..
Griffin rage
I have never done an illegal drug... I'm not even sure how you could even have intercourse with an illegal drug... Consumed on the other hand... :D
Man she is such a bitch
Oh cool, Amazon has more blindbags for $3!! :D
08,01actually, i used to have an alcohol problem...
Trixie really just needs to be run over with a steamroller. Slowly and tail first.
Miiiiiiine!!!
Dun dun dun!
so, odds of seeing Gilda again are what?:P
amazon has blindbags?
:O
DUUUUUUUUUUM DUUUUUUUUUUM DUM DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM!
Buy the WHOLE blind bag set on hasbrotoyshop and use MLPTEN as the code for 10 percent off
dat "oooh"
2,14 meanwhile, you gave me a BRILLIANT idea
WHo here would actually care if Gilda came back
08,01RAWRity: well, i took an intervention to the temple
2,14 you ever seen "A Fish Named Wanda"
DUUUUUUUUUUM DUUUUUUUUUUM DUM DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM!
http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg3/scaled.php?server=3&filename=pic3e.png&res=medium
How did she do that?
08,01and by intervention, i mean baseball bat
That film is fantastic ValtheJean.
ValtheJean: Can't say I have.
"Asshoooooole!"
How did she not break her neck?
and by baseball bat, he means MLP
OH MY GOD NIDNIGHT FIRE!!!!!!!!
2,14 oh, that's a shame meanwhile. And /) Lasharus
11,01Major League Pony?
Midnight_Fire: rofl.

08,01RAWRity: that is exactly what i am saying.
I wanna see Gilda ANF Trixie return

00,03Sing along, everypony!
...
What the crap is this?
Falls onto tracks! :O
i like trains.......
otakon: I know, but still.
awesome funky indian singing!
I can't speak random.
never been there...friend said everyone is poor and racist
Pretty sure it's illegal to dance on the front of a moving train engine...
And then he was train
so many MONTAGES
we recently analyzed what main things are in a bollywood movie
http://derpy.me/IjNB9
Wow 1.9/10
I have never seen this movie
what movie is this?
08,01serious and kinda creepy question: are any of you interested in coming to India with me this Summer?
I met an indian, not to be rude, but his fragrance was unsettling, but that was the spices
he's a hustler
08,01it is
This guy is weird...
literal video
this film is sure funny xD
10,02Wouldn't it be great if the makers of Epic Movie make a big spoof of all the Bollywood Movies? :D
Is that a record low score for Bronystate B movies?
SuperBrony64: no
Indians Ftw.
07,01@ SB no
SuperBrony64 - no, no it wouldn't.
SuperBrony64: no. that would be awful.
No, SB
oh no...
dem ladies reminded my of the Weird PMV with some weird reporterish girl and applejack
Scoot-Scootaloo: the HUMIDITY
/me hits SuperBrony64 with a bus.
superbrony!
No, that would be trixie bad
SB yes
how do you pm?
I see Indians at my job every day. they're nice people, just their odors could use some improvement
What did I join into?
do we need to know how to dance ?
This is better than last night-- the stream is stable.
swag
richfiles: you mean SuperBrony64 fav thing?
seems safe
08,01DKen2021: interesting fact actually, most indian food contains Fenugreek, which is a spice; the smell of which is not broken down by the body and is secreted through the skin
Epic Movie was a bloody atrocity, and is enough to drive me to swear. Loudly. So really, my dear SuperBrony64, don't even SUGGEST things like that.
THIS part
Kencolt you jinxed it to lag.
08,01that's why indians smell
I have business to do this year...no time for longer travel...even bronycon will cost much time
but as said, most of that is because of the spices they frequent
Luna: because of you, i have a fondness for bollywood
my eyes!
07,01great :)
00,03I never knew that!
mmmmm
Wow, an indian chav??
What is that video called anyway?
richfiles: I don't know, ask SuperBrony64
08,01Sheepy: ha!
Bunty Aur Babli
suddenly hot chick
aur means and?
08,01Sheepy: you've never been to bradford...
Is it going to freeze on that wonderful meme again?
oh, I thought it was they use frankencinse
and, maybe?
yes derpy_pony
Luna: has anyone told you about the meme that spawned from this film last night?
i hope so
10,02What video?
flutter_spin: if your lucky yes
is the whole movie a musical?
07,01yep
Who knows flutter_spin. http://i.imgur.com/MESBm.jpg
My dad used to work for Mumtaz
07,01I heard it was lagtastic last night
SuperBrony64: its the one with the reporter and AJ from Rythm Heaven
Hey SuperBrony64, what's that one vid called with the music that sounds like the ladies here and some reporter lady tsing/talking it to Applejack?
A resteront there
http://derpy.me/JtiaC
00,03It all worked out in the end, Luna!
Luna: yes, but it gave us a new meme, so it's okay.
Luna: you have nO idea, a meme was born last night
lets dance: indian edition
Luna: http://i.imgur.com/MESBm.jpg
08,01see, i have this thing about indian men and women. i can't find indian women sexy, because they remind me too much of my mother, and i can't find indian men sexy because they remind me too much of my brother
Luna: Indian Stallone
Not... exactly. It's really a hiest flick-- with musical numbers thrown in at apparently random intervals.
10,02Oh yeah, I'll PM you the link to it.
I'm outta here let ne know when this is over
Kencolt: eeyup, were you here last night?
this goes on for too long
kidzrul434: 3 hours
I was the one who noted his eyes were derped.
00,03Hope you have 3 hours to kill!
Yeah, 170min long this film is
Remember just because you're picking a b movie doesn't mean you have to pick a bad one
08,01RAWRity: i can see it, but my brain just says "no"
/me glomps SuperBrony64 WHY ARE YOU NEVER ONLINE ANY MORE???
I better have not just got addicted to Bollywood.
08,01i love redheads, thouhg
3 hours is pretty average for a Bollywood film
IshBestPony: eeyup
07,01@ RAWRity agreed :)
Isure was.
10,02I'm always online O___O
SPOILER ALERT: singing and dancing in this movie
agreed IshBestPony
08,01though i've been with an indian woman once, and that was... interesting
3 hours? Screw that, I'm leaving.
is damn movie made me miss the premier this morning
00,03In akk honesty, I like this film! It gives you a sense of culture :3
08,01brain said "that skin is the correct colour"
stayed up so late watching it :(
10,02But school takes up all of my time it seems :/
00,03all*
Midnight_Fire: you are addicted to pony...bollywood isn't much weirder
SuperBrony64 is online foreeeeveeeer
/me got bored and left
Hey wait! is this a musical!?
IS there even a plot to this movie?
08,01normally, i find white people pasty and hilarious
It was so worth it when it froze
No. NO!.. I WILL make it through this movie. >:O
07,01good :)
Yup an indian chav on a moped
SuperBrony64: :(....and you want me to go to that college???
And yes, Indian women are sexy
O.O whats this movie about?
2 1/2 hours of ancing, 10 minutes of film, 20 minutes of credits.
good luck
Yeah, there is a plot. >_>
Give me any kind of woman to be honest, black/white/asian/indian I'm not particualry picky they are ALL attractive in their own way
dancing*
<--- *puts on his determined face*
I see a lot of elderly indian women... think twice if you hook up with one with the intention to stay together forever ;)
10,02I wonder if they had permission to film on that train...
08,01Sheepy: all indians ride mopeds
i think its an hour of signing
non-stop
2 1/2 of singing.
*pushes the guy off the building*
but there not all chav's
0,14see, this movie made me realize
singing*
It's kind of not really about anything-- it's pure, unadulterated escapism.
firggin catchy indian song
Movie over
0,14we need a Bollywood-based MLP episode
I've seen a part of this movie yesterday...there are scenes where they don't dance
08,01SuperBrony64: it's india, half the peeople on the train don't have permission to be there.
This movie is about aliens that integrate themselves into humanity with song.
wut
I gotta' go to work. You guys have fun, heh.
Yes, Saxy, yes we do
10,02U SO SILLY :3
There's a very clear plot to the film, what are you talking about? XD
I am pretty sure India is nothing like this
00,03Inb4 dubstep remixes
08,01it's like indian Fiddler on the Roof
08,01SuperBrony64: but it's true!
Quick prep for those who don't know much about Bollywood: They switch genre every 10 minutes. It can go from a drama to a comedy to a spy thriller to a musical in the span of the first act alone.
08,01SuperBrony64: they all hang onto the roof
08,01trufax.
A Bollywood-inspired episode starring Lyra, Octavia, and Vinyl Scratch.

i cannot afford 3 hours to watch this, have fun you all :/
08,01Pale_Horse: i would watch, and then possibly tap, that.

The only way you could watch this and miss the plot is to ....well, to just not pay attention. >.>
So when do they open the 7-11
ekips: believe me, we will not have fun.
Aaaah, ive got to go for a while everypony!! Until then! T.T

So SuperBrony64? Is that somehow based on or using aspects of Rhythm Heaven? I've seen that game at work, and have no clue if it's any good at all. But if PONIES!! :O :$
Sumica, you missed the birth of another meme

08,01they run alongside the train like that and sell you tea
You got a little spot on yer head there, sugarcube.
08,01it's amazing!

lol richfiles
08,01okay, lemme explain the indian head dot
what you got on yer head, boy?
hmm. Now I want to try indian train tea...
That loading screen o.o
08,01it's called a Bindi in the north and a Butti in the south
Ingwaz: eeyup. now they air at 1 pm EST
08,01in the north, only married women wear it, as an auspicious symbol of good luck in marriage
That load screen
08,01in the south, girls wear it too
/me dusts Nittany_Discord.
00,03Nittany O U
Huh. crappy window repair there...
08,01so if you see an unmarried girl wearing one, you know she's from the south
08,01anyhoos, it's meant to bring prosperity and status
didn't know that
what about those bracelets they wear (called bangals, I believe)?
It's a KFC store.
08,01gues don't generally wear them
interesting
08,01*guys
11,01And that you're brains are about to explosively leave your head.
200 out of 100?
08,01Starflash: it's india, of course it's weird
Cuz I've seen several indian guys with em
08,01india is second weirdest country
08,01next to japan
00,03Thats what I get for getting information about other commercials from Family Guy -_-
richfiles: i'm guessing its you then, i saw the comic where filly twilight sneaks in and wears celestia's crown and armor, someone with the name richfiles had made a rather fun followup comment
How did I know you were gonna say Japan
Nittany - I see a lot of zombies wearing those in Left 4 Dead 2
the bracelet is called a Kadah, or something like that (I think I spelled it wrong)
And THIS is where he gets set on a life of crime and random musical numbers.
00,03Wow, I iz confused :#
Yeah. I do those with my main acount often.
08,01Kencolt: you made me lulz
It's rare that those two lifestyles intersect.

11,01wrong your
11,01For me.
08,01have any of you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
yes
08,01because if not, goddamnit, you should
08,01it's amazing
00,03MFW I didn't :3
/me didn't think Slumdog Millionaire was all that great.
That's what people keep saying about Lion King but I'm not seeing that either.
You should see the comment I did for Canibal LOLercaust, The Zecora +Applebloom comic
08,01Meanwhile: why not?
Cba.
You haven't seen Lion King?
08,01Meanwhile: it's basically Hamlet with lions
It spaned two full comments! LOL :$

toilet O.o
yes SaxyPretender, you're now a female dog.
08,01and less singing...
0,14O_O
English, as I understand it, is kind of the universal second language of India-- something like 50 local languages, but most people learn English.
Never seen Lion King.
Hamlet in a nutshell: King's brother kills the king. King's son seeks revenge
inb4 ear bleeding
08,01Kencolt: true
"please come with me to the toilet" wat?

You're 54?!

08,01it was the best
08,01CK|Gone: are you?
A study proved that men DO NOT always think about sex
Nope.
Meanwhile: *raises his eyebrow* you really think so eh?
00,03eenope.
08,01CK|Gone: aw
08,01:P
They just assume I am. :P
meh
11,01Inv4 I'm r63'd marrying someone. *yikes*
08,01CK|Gone: well, such is often the case with ponies
they needed a study to prove that?
emangamer: Not really, but who knows really.
CK|Gone: tell them you arent?
*If you were gay song*
Meanwhile: I do... *snickers*
Nittany_Discord I may hold you to that someday...
lol.
emangamer: you think you do.
My family merely thinks I'm an oddball. THis is okay. I AM an oddball, and oddly proud of it.
Matlan.
Starflash: They're Republican, facts don't phase them. :p
Jajjan best pony
-_-
:)
my colleagues automaticly linked MLP with furries. they look at me weird now
Meanwhile: oh, I know it for a fact who peagsister16 is into *snickers s'more*
why do they waste studies on the most common answers?
Yay my family. My family exists entirely out of oddballs and hippies
11,01Don't r63 me marrying someone unless you r63 the other person.

Oh, and I am a Republican-- and we're ALL about the facts. Deal.
11,01*facehoof*
Your facts are wrong. Go figure.
My dad is hardcore Republican too. When I showed him my PMVs he seemed impressed, though he did ask if this is some sort of "gay thing"
Ken: That explains a lot actually. <3
00,10Hussle, indaia edition.
08,01i... dislike the furry fandom now
08,01CountDoofus: well, i was a furry in the 90s, when it was a very very different place
11,01Forget what I said.
08,01much like the brony fandom today
08,01kinda awesome
08,01then it became... what it is now
There are furries and there are furries. It all depends.
but then it went rule 34 all over the place?
08,01so much drama, so much porn...
08,01y'know, frak that
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwzvx04rAB1qhkchgo1_500.png
11,01The brony fandom may go that route if we're not careful.
god let's hope not
08,01Nittany_Discord: aye, and i hope it doesn't
05,15I'm afraid it will though :(
00,03odds are, it probably will in a couple of years...
RAWRity: that last ones just cool
00,03or months.
It's sorta on that route in my opinion
08,01so far, i've seen a m inor amount of brony drama, but mostly seems free of it
Drama? I don't think I wanna know, do I? XD
11,01I like the fandom.
This is why I am sometimes vocal about my disdain for r34 and the like
Drama happens
11,01It's better than the show.
I think I come off as self-rightious, but I just don't want the community to go that direction
I like this fandom too, even though there are some minor things I don't like about it
I've found a site focusing on everything MLP rule 34-ed. One site I wouldn't mind being blocked by SOPA
People will go where they want, regardless of what you say.
Dken2021 like?
11,01It needs to stay a force of good and not devolve into a crazy religion or a civil-warring fandom.
It's the nature of teh show... we're not going there, much, we're going to be about the message. Love and Tolerance. THAT'S what makes us bronies.
rather not discuss it
Look at that guy who wandered into a mineshaft that was on fire.
ok~
People told him no but did he listen
dat face
Anyone know of a good fanfic? I feel like reading one.
Ofc not. and he was incinerated.
Bronyzilla: I got one for ya
Bronyzilla: I recommend "Beating the Heat"
Alright.
08,01Rare: hmm, maybe yeah. certainly not like the brony fandom, i think
I find this movie slightly weird.
Only slightly?
only slightly.
0,5BronyZilla I know one
0,5:P
00,03slightl?
/me has never been a part of a fandom. :P
Actseption: Act while you act
Gotta go to work. Bye guys!
Furry has always had pricks it took the Internet victimisation diffrent than brony has
later richfiles
okay this is just weird
Okay...
well gonna go, enjoy the bollywood, I'm sure Matthew Patel will like you for it
Plus brony isn't as heavly slammed as furry was/is

fun fact: that wasnt a sitar. it was something else
that was alien

00,03I don't want to say it was an alien...
00,03But it was an alien.
Bah
Scoot-Scootaloo I knew it!!
R34 is a fact of life
dat sound
Pony has little more than other fandoms
Ancient alien dude is now a brony
:3
Its how it's treated, in brony it is, but it's by no way integral.

Xles true, but seeing our major sites don't really have much if any home for r34 it's less likely to happen
08,01i like suggestive art, but not hardcore pony porn
...dat outfit...
woo! Dance time!
08,01because suggestive can be cute
why was the movie interrupted by a music video?
08,01owlicious: bollywood, that's why
0,14because Bollywood
owlicious: because Music numbers are the best part of the film.
0,14also, this song is so catchy
08,01Kencolt: aye
lOL
You don't understand, the music video is interrupted by a movie in between
oh
08,01bollywood is full of Big Lipped Aligator Moments
05,15india has right hand wheel?
Dumorimasoddaa: Pony fandom is in its infancy, we better be careful how we get percieved by the masses early on. First impressions last. ...Just ask the furry fandom. ;)
that isn't my husband
08,01fluttercry: yup
yay, somepony thinks I'm awesome
05,15well...that would make sense
Pinkie would definitely approve of the amount of random songs out of nowhere in this movie
Is it you?
Niiice :D
10,02Wow, women seem to be mistreated in India...
Fun fact: The singing is dubbed. Almost no Bollywood actors sing their own songs
Don't blink, blink and you're dead
08,01they were a british colony, so they have their wheel on the *correct* side :P
:( Way to ruin it Midnight_Fire
08,01Jim: /)
It is the correct side. deal w/ it
sorry
00,03Left sided cars FTW!
(\
damn thish lag
YAY PEDO BEAR APROVAL
There will always be people crying out that a certain contigency will ruin everything
The brony fandom has the first impression of awesome. I mean people who dislike the idea of it will pick at ANY thing to make us seem deprived and don't even need evidence
Once upon a time, it was radio and movies that were rotting people's brains.
11,01Boop.
I wonder if the huge amount of random dancing in bollywood movies has inspired internet memes about dancing akin to what we do with planking.
Another thing I noticed about furries was that the fandom at one point became paranoid about public opinion to the point that people got shitstormed for linking furry sites on other websites
And before that, they tried to control books and printing strictly.
11,01Sorry, that was on my end with my Cat sitting on my keyboard.
Rare: I once got banned from a channel because I wouldn't join in in the furry hate. =D
Sly bastards ;D
08,01RAWRity: yes; see The Guild
I think the people who protest over moral degeneracy usually have worst tastes than even the most honest, open people I know.
The Guild, as in Felicia Day?
08,01which we should also stream at some point
08,01Pyrexo: eeyup
I'm glad I never joined in on that planking, owling, batmanning lollapalooza
Furry just got weird, it couldn't ignor the chans and got so defensive.
xles: Wow, that's harsh
Glad I'm not the only one who watches that ;D
PADAKE~
00,10This movie needs more indian stalone
0,14^
eyup
Ultimayte scammers.

Would love to see it streamed some time.
I doubt that level of defensiveness helped.
08,01i have no idea what's goign on in this film...
All season 1 is an hour
Well, isn't this quite an action packed film.
http://derpy.me/6ajDW
Rare: Yeah, they were bashing furries, I stepped in and said that "Furries aren't That bad..." "NOT THAT BAD?!" ...and that was the end of that. Fun fact, that ban is still active. =)
Dat beard.

Rare: And that was in like 2000 or something like that.

08,01it's funny that there are otakus who love Japanese culture, but there isn't really an equiveleant for indian culture, which is... almost as weird
08,01and, i'd argue, far more rich

0,14it's catchy
It is.
But then so is fly.

Close enough.
/me shrugpony.
00,03I think they're running away from their parents to escape an arranged marriage.
I dislike Hindi culture but I like Japanese.
xles: That is kind of over the top. I guess they just let the bans pile up forever there then.
And also, Anime has less random acts of musical numbers.
00,10http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/134011
/me dislikes no culture
Well I don't dislike but I don't like in the same way as Hindi
Geth pony? me gusta
0,14Actually, she's running away to escape an arranged marriage, and he's looking to get rich, iirc
08,01Starflash: ah, right, yeah
08,01that's very true
Merely a Mare. Was I reading that or not.
08,01because it's way more different than japanese culture, to western culture
because japan is nowadays, pretty western oO
00,03Sorry, I don't listen to rap music...
Rare: No, I was in there for quite a few years, they tend to remove bans fairly regularly. Or at least they used to, haven't been in there for 10 years for obvious reasons.
08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: rap music is hilarious

Well it stole my pizza.
08,01rather, Socialism/Marxism

They probably actually called some big god and it got translated to "God"
I love the system of Pokemon Day cares and naming pokemon: If you want your virginity back, that'll be 200 dollars.
08,01Communism/Stalinism is right wing

The failure of communism ironically does show that revolutions cannot change the way humans work

Definitely! Though it makes me miss "So You Think You Can Dance". They always had a Bollywood routine or two and I loved 'em
This is what Bollywood is all about
I just found myself actually lapping mu hands. I'm so ashamed.
0,5Antidisestablishmentarianism
one thing the Indians have much of, it's choreography
as I understand it, from an economic standpoint, the furthest "Right" is a market economy, in which business practices are dicided by whatever makes the most profit, with no governmental oversight.
08,01heh, whenever asked my religion on official forms, i write "onanist"
Communism > all fors of government.... PERIOD!
00,03inb4 someone makes a RainbowDash bellydancer outfit.

Denmark is a very socialistic nation, actually.
Agreed. :D
00,10also ok with that luna
I check chat and I see Rainbow Dash in belly dancer outfit...
0,14We need a Bollywood pony ep
on the other end, "Left" is the command economy, where the government makes all decisions concerning how businesses are run and how the market conducts itself.
I don't even know if 'socialistic' is a word, but it is now.
00,03Why can't I hold all these Want?
how much longer is this film?

10,02Is it bad that I like this movie but not understand the story that's going on?
11,01But not towards socialism.
05,15Same here SB
It's scary what communism did to the Eastern Europe countries. There are areas where you can't leave anything out of sight unless you literally chain it down.

11,01And the car companies would be bankrupt.
and then they kissed
11,01Lobbying has created Corporatism.
The auto industry would've died years ago, too. :p
08,01Hydrazine: not in a bollywood film :P
Or draw Trixie being hit with a steam roller. That'd be cooler.
05so much bellydancing requests >.>
00,10here comes the best actor
08,01and that, ladies and gentlemen, was a bollywood kiss.
hehe
Nittany: But isn't Lobbying a necessary consequence of capitalism?
08,01CriticKitten: but trixie!
The closest Bollywood movies get to sex scenes is 20 minute long hugs.
05,15make it Twi and not Trixie, and I'm interested
11,01Dunno.
that was a kiss :P
0,14...oh God, I'm imagining Twi doing a bollywood dance
11,01I see some good in it, but mostly bad.
08,01Meanwhile: but she's so very pretty!
It seems in Bollywood, it's more risque to kiss than to be nearly naked.
10,02Hey Wrek, gonna throw this COMPLETELY NEW idea at you, how about we do a Rarity...but bellydancing. :3
0,14IT'S AMAZING
11,01Because it's bucking democracy.
SaxyPretender: AND IT. IS. GLORIOUS
0,5xD
00,10Must be cause you draw such nice bellys wrek.
Ken: It's a cultural thing
They also have 20 minute musicla numbers
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man and bring him to the ground.
the whole mane 6 belly dancing :P
Saxy: INORITE
i want to dip my toes in that well
SuperBrony64: I agree with this suggestion and support it whole heartedly.
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad and leave him when he's down.
SuperBrony64..... I have mixed feelings on that Idea >>....

Utterly evil idea for a pony animation... Two ponies watching a movie. Pony A: I don't get this random musical number stuff. Pony B (as Winter Wrap up starts in the background) : Me neither. Never happens around here...
SuperBrony64 server left on and no sb on it? i sense a trap....

11,01Lol.
Really? I thought the episodes aired at 0900 EST usually? Stupid time zones.
xles: they used to, then they moved to 10 pm. Now, 1 pm.
*10 am
1 pm? z0mg that is a long wait for pony. I'll just have to sleep in I guess.
*yay* a musical number
inb4 I need an adult
RAWRity: Right. So 1800 GMT, then.
indian_stallone now
I'm 12 and what is this?
00,10Guess that meens I wont be doing all night marathons
SONG TIME
I am totally lost. I think I am going to call it a night. Bye y'all
And before they can do anything other than a weak kiss, it's musical time. because, well, it's India.

Why are all 12 year olds so clueless
not all of 'em
00,10I dont think I could stay up that long.
because they are 12
i never hear from 11 or 13 year olds
Sumica: it's just an extra 3 hours!
00,10I am dieing by the end of new eps at the time they start as it is.
11,01I am 13, I know everything!
those lyrics....
05,15everyone knows anyone older than 9 and younger than 15 is 12
what about next year
makes sense
will they never age?
that's going to suck
11,01They use 12 because of COPPA, which restricts 12-year-olds and less from certain websites.
13thought it was 13
Have anypony here ever seen Pucca?
I was 13 14 years ago
it seems to be under 13 it applies to
never heard of it
what is it?
i was 9000 1 year ago

The first 5 minute of the episode were just out of no where and awesome. That just let into an even more awesome episode.
11,01I know.
it is, i miss the beginning of the music, that was a so epic moment ... when there is a song, on this chat ^^
00,03The song sold it to me
0,14^
0,14the song makes me want to cry manly tears
I am listening to the song now. BEST SONG EVER.
And this makes the scam believeable.
10,02Dat translation
Same here Saxy~
11,01That, and they added brand-new stuff.
i watch it 3 time, it's a really good episod
Nothiong can make this scam believable

00,03I had it on my iPod BEFORE it came out! ....i'm a terrible person...
10,02AIs that guy seriously believe they would sell/lease the Taj Majal?

toodles Starflash~
10,02OWNED
Gondor has all my care in it. http://i.imgur.com/07ACp.jpg
Flim Flam and Smile song are my favorites ever.
05,15oink oink oink was best song
/me hugs Starflash
This song lifts your spirits when I'm depressed
Midnight_Fire: IDK...that song had too much progressive talking in it to be very catchy
Art of the dress is best song!
;)
oink oink oink xD so fun
/me glomps SuperBrony64 will as much force as he can muster
0,14Cutie Mark Crusaders is best song
Fluttercry agree on that
fluttercry: man, you really misspelled Smile there.
It was more of a traditional musical number
intro is best song
00,03Saxy: Agreed
night Starflash : 3
i like the fact, that 4200 people watch the live stream
After that I'd say Becoming Popular is second best season 2 song
You need a Doctor?

A priest, a rapist and a criminal walk into a bar. He orders a drink
look he has a gun ! where is the iron giant ?
Rain: Sorry, didn't mean to.

A neutron walks into a bar, orders a drink. He is about to pay when the bartender says "for you, no charge"
more birds noise please
it miss to me now, since this morning
Meanwhile: Panda says "I have a genetic disorder that causes my hands to swell up. Makes my work as an auto technician very difficult"
00,03owlicious HAHAHAHA! So funny joke
RAWRity, you want to spend the rest of the year with Gondor?
owlicious: the Neutron then tells the bar tender that that joke has been said to him so many times that he is sick of it, then storms out."
lol
0,14...for some reason, Meanwhile and RAWRity are reminding me of AJ and RD...
Ship them now!
0,14no
05,15So two ions are talking, when suddenly one says I just lost an electron. The other replys, are you sure, to shich the first replys, I'm positive
0,14not in that way
damn this movie makes me feel tired really ._.
TO THE MOON
Tickets? I'm going by cannon.
BEEEEE YETCH
Incoming Musical Sign-- I can feel it...
I meant that I want to ship them in a box saxy :3
Meanwhile: it is impossible to do that, as Gondor is a ficitioius location from J. R. R. Tolkein's Middle Earth universe.
to the MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
nopony like banana ?
TO THE MOON
aaaah ^^
RAWRity: http://i.imgur.com/07ACp.jpg
i expect a negative reaction to that joke fluttercry
poor luna
Dohohoho
11,01Lol fluttercry.
Meanwhile: impossible. Gondor was never established to have been on the moon in the Lord of the Rings novels.
RAWRity: Perhaps you should reread it.
11,01Aren't they neutral until one loses his electron?
05,15yeah I probably should have said atoms
yeah
05,15because the one that lost the electron is the ion
Because you obviously missed the chapter where Celestia descended and moved Gondor to the moon so Luna would be less lonely.
ions are descibed as non-neutral
Dang superstitions :|
0,14she mad
And then chat broke.
Or did it.
Which didn't really work because Luna was all. "Eeewww. Humans. She just had to make it worse."
Yeah. It did.
it's friddd..... no, it's saturday night !!!!
Refreeeesh.
Inb4 awkward...

Better
Out of interest SaxyPretender, which of us is which?
Actually, that's very sweet~
this part of the movie ... there is more than an hours i guess
and then i was like oatmeal are you crazy?!
What IS this movie in the first place?
0,14...that's hard to say, the banter between the two of you is what's giving me that impression
long movie is long
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/17421 Look at this for a second and let your brain register it
In that case dibs on AJ.
Yes, he is holding a Chilele
0,14I guess if I HAD to say who was who, RAWRity's currently the AJ to your RD

Kentcolt: Are you sure that wasn't Lyra and R Dash?

11,01I think it was Lyra and RD.

it hasn't ended yet?
Until eventually you've all learned to speak Hindi and break into dance in the street
Oh, GODS-- you mean it's LOOPING?
anyways, going to bed. got to pick up a friend from a party in like 5 hours, and driving with sleep deprivation = not good

08,01SuperBrony64: bollywood, so probably about 3 hours
00,10170min
All I knew was that it was a game with a ball and little pointy things
-,-
10,02O___O
it should end soon
But I never played it
11,01This movie is long.
00,10it's got aroun 15 min left
170 minutes
I might as well watch the rest.
how much of the movie has plot?
10,02Silly Bollywood, this isn't King Kong or Titanic.
Pretty average length for Bollywood
0,14or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
SuperBrony64: that's how bollywood works.
For them, movies are a day long event with an intermission and everything.
I've only seen one bollywood movie under 2 hours long
I like sugar
...SPOON
Or maybe it was about 2 hours
ohai SaxyPretender and SuperBrony64
Don't think of it as a movie. Think of it as a TV miniseries you're marathoning.

to tha mooooooooon
then they deserved it?
and their child deserves it?
just what did they do to go to jail forever?
that's some serious crimes
conned abunch of people
Children don't matter, RAWRity. Didn't Mansley teach you that?
semc you didn't watch the film did you
