8,6hugging is fine, rape is not
04goddamnit more drama
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21482073
00,03and hugging is fine, to an extent
Wrek|Dusty: would you rage if it was slow?
Scoot-Scootaloo: how far can tickling go
When is rape ever fine -___--
Im just talking against the ones who claims RP to be strictly forbidden.
6drake that was more or less just the timing of your join
so basically, nothing intimate.
Wrek|Dusty: wait for it
When it's a faantaasyy
04ok then
Wrek|Dusty: What is this soundtrack?
but this chat is also pg-13 during streams, right?
Om: Never. Rape is unacceptable.
GilDash: Exactly, it shouldn't even need to be said...
Om: pretty much
http://memegenerator.net/instance/21482122
(・ω ・)
00,03Don't even mention Rape...
8,6light RP in itself is not forbidden. When someone takes the RP past just fun and into the creeper zone, it's an issue. When someone starts spamming /me or any other form of in-character RP, it's an issue
00,10Oh hi all
Bronysith: DUDE STOP
Only during saturday showings?
Its PG13 ish
What most people class as RP is against the rules.
lol Bronysith So many xD
yeah-
Sumica! WELCOME, mah man!
Hi Sumica
Sumica: wasabi
Sumica: nice timing lawl o hai
hey Sumica hows your day been
Basically, Don't act like a C*nt :)
Do not be uncomfortable, basically
Sumica: fallout or skyrim?
00,03So if you are all like "/me puts x on a pedestal and worships", that is not allowed
Bai :D Every:p one :d i haz school :"(
What is this soundtrack anyway?
I agree. This soudntrack is Freaking FANTASTIC!
Scoot-Scootaloo: okay
What I find amazing is that in that short time I was here, there were very few trolls.
10(*-ω-)
bye Alicorn_Shane
Scoot-Scootaloo: is glomping RP?
Cya Shane.
Scoot-Scootaloo: quite the example xD
00,10dont have fallout so cant say
8,6if you need clarification on the extent of the rule, I'll refer you to either the first rule or the last rule, take your pick
/me waves bai to the mods and NewDCD
bye shana
thank u NewDCD for helping me
00,03Glomping is alright... but just to an extent
00,10and today is hot as always
Bye Alicorn_Shane
I hardly ever see trolls here, but its a way faster chat, so I prefer it in early mornings or when side channels are open
┐(￣ω ￣)┌

/me glomps Scoot-Scootaloo
gawd that looks bad
04(.v.)

Poor bastards. I hope they're being paid for this
nope. don't know who he is
Ninjazz|Challenge: Funs stuffs
What's up with those rappers on video game devs conferences?
Ponies47: well, don't try to force it on him too much, cause if you do hes gonna end up possibly getting annoyed by it. And that will make it even harder to make him like the show.
SirGanjalf mony
Om: Fan favorite too.
03I can google it, but often these places have more than one building
:)
hi SirGanjalf
03like on Friday when I went to the wrong place
can somepony link me to the ubi stream?
hi Strange-Benhur
03luckily they were like "oh, you want the building across the street"
Ubi, this is sad. Guys, come on. It's not hard. Play a 2 minute clip of Assassin's Creed 3 and watch your audience wet themselves. But no, you lead with shitty rap
And Just Dance 4.

Kipkat07_USAF: I hear that.
Kipkat07_USAF: today isn't that bad!!
Sumica: Ikr? :D
Why do people I've never even heard of ship me with Trixie? This is absurd.
00,10ohhi
Sumica: Its the end of the world!
Meanwhile: -lol- Im kid_cobalt and Ancient Rain
CCCP: Yes it is.
Hm.
I wonder who Wrek is drawing. I hope its Firewall. =P
Okay that was interesting.
Meanwhile: xD
Meanwhile: Lol
Kipkat07_USAF: That is why we as humans find things to distract and entertain ourselves. To forget about reality for a while.
Meanwhile: Iron_Edge is my OC.
00,10wonder if it's Firewall
Kipkat07_USAF: i mean think about it, porn was much harder to find back then, and you had to pay for it!
Sumica: FIREWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL?
sagas: exactly, ponies
murphy

Wait.

00,10yep it's firewall

CCCP: the only thing good about this generation is ponies

:p
Murphy, NOOOO
Kipkat07_USAF: CCCP does have a point...
Kipkat07_USAF: what about the wonderfulness of the internet?
This actually looks sort of interesting.
Sumica: indeed it is
I wonder if Cardslafter even knows. SOme one should pm to check it out. =P
2Haha yeah, the hat :D
oo
sagas: yes i do :D
Ermm.. time to play TF2..
Who is Firewall? From a fic? O.o
THIS I WANTA
CCCP: That too. But outside of that, everything sucks
Like, this is kind of a legit-ish use of the Wii U tech.
God I hate the Wii.
For those who dont know, Firewall is the main character and OC from a fic "Through the Eyes of Another Pony"
/me hides
^
Meanwhile: same, Wii sucked.
dat xbox controller
RyunosukeKnT: Ah! Ty :D
00,10eh what RyunosukeKnT?
2:3
I'm....surprised that I see the Wii U's tech being used well. O.o
CCCP: You know what they say, "THe internet is for porn!"
RaveBrony Through the Eyes of Another Pony. Give it a read it is really good. So good infact there is a website dedicated to animating it like the show.
I am just saying, Sumica has a wierd fascination with Firewalls lately :)
sagas: lol dat song!
I...dont really read tho :\
Anyways, TF2 time..
00,10I do?
Great. They made a fucking Ipod touch that you can play on your TV. Are you fucking kidding me?
Have fun FlareChaser|TF2 :P
Sumica: Personally. I still dont get how people mistake you for female. idk..
Kipkat07_USAF: i mean i guess
it seems so :)
RaveBrony: thank you thank you.
RaveBrony: too long didn't read lol
Ravebrony Audiobook?

Meanwhile: SO ORIGINAL
MahBoi777: Yeah, haha :D

Damn it, eyes... Work...
Onto S2 E4
Kipkat07_USAF: what about video games
Where are the m-16s?
CCCP: I think I was meant to be born in 1917
Wrek|Dusty: That better be a paint brush... :|
ZR?
Actually....I'll admit this is sort of a cool use of the Wii U tech.
This shit is why I hate E3. It just justifies my lack of faith in the gaming industry.
ZR
wow.. Wii u is being used great
/me puts a Lucario hat on Nick's head
Irish_Pony: Oh just you wait and see....
DA BOOTH. Man fuck your booth.
What was that?
hi
Ninjazz|Challenge watching MLP or something?
00,10What I read the fic and wrek did alot of the art for the story so yeah I know it.
Kipkat07_USAF: life expectancy was much lower
CCCP: We didnt need video games back then. We could jump in the brook or plant stuff
Sumica: thats kinda how i found it....lol
Barbetos|AtWork: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png
When I first heard of this system, I expected the tech to be used poorly just like the Wiimote's waggle was.
CCCP: And its lower now too because of obesity
Im off to bed. Good night Guys!
But....that's pretty good actually.
That sounds original.
....
Aisha only plays mature games.

>Wii U title

And when will these people ever learn that none of us care about them? They are not why we watch this stuff.

Kipkat07_USAF: capitalism
That guy has been awol for too long
00,10As I said it's firewall
OH MY GOD

Dirty console playing peasants.
I look forward to seeing ZombiU at next E3
U Mad Sony and Microsoft
although the sea front had a lot of jubilee celebrations going on and there was chucked away food so might be some burgers around or something
Kipkat07_USAF: you can still listen to it
mm burgers...
it didn't disapear
mfw those titles on the Wii U
Kipkat07_USAF: Shame is idealistic but not realistic. It would be nice, but I doubt it could ever work in reality
jk
Aisha and Toby could not be a worse pairing. :D

cachi01: lol so much U
Kipkat07_USAF: the military is much more of an asshole now indays and u can kill as many innocent people as you want and get a medal for it
i personaly think Kingdom Hearts would be perfect for the Wii U
BATMAN
I feel Nitendo makes all their money of nostalgic old brand. None of their original stuff never seems to work
Aisha is awesome <3
2Man I wish I had a burger
MahBoi777: ikr lol
Kipkat07_USAF: we also have nukes
They should've named it Dead Island: GB
CriticKitten: Yeah, she just seems nasty to Toby and he's just... well, likable like you said.
CCCP: Families are too detached, they dont have the same kind of feel anymore. What ever happened to the milkman? The paperboy? Evening T.V.?

Aisha's an exec trying way too hard to be likeable by gamers.

Kipkat07_USAF: it just seems that way, when you watch a movie from the 50's families are all happy and everything seems nice, older people talk about the good ol days, because they forget all the bad shit that happend. Life has never been good, and will never EVER be good.

Uh.
CCCP: family values shape our future. I could have turned out to be a dick, but I lived with seniors and I became polite and generous. But then there are factors you cant control, like introversion versus extroversion. I am an introvert and that has made me fine. But it proves my point because I lived with old people from that time so I grew up to want to be like them
Shoot him?
You....could try shooting him guys
nut right now im just seeing conor jumping in tress and killing deers lol
They must be in easy mode
Great, you're dead now. Way to make England proud
Not even guy in a quilt was spared...
11,01I may never forgive Ubisoft for always-on.
/me wubs In_Love_Luna <3
You lost to a guy with an axe and you all had rifles at close range
Bravo
CCCP: Then I realized how shitty the world is now and how little people care about their lives
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHHPStULCPA
Kipkat07_USAF: who cares about anything?
Irish_Pony: I wub you <3
The redcoats obviously lost the war because they were fucking incompetent as hell, according to this game. >_>
In_Love_Luna: <3
lol
*kilt
Kipkat07_USAF: being polite is not that important
....
CCCP: Sweet celestia you are a dark one..
...
And now he's going to attack an entire fort of redcoats?
Any Pony Know the name of this Song?
Really?
Not-BG&E2 looks pretty good so far
that is one reason I dont play... semi-historical games like AC
Please don't tell me he pulls this off
LOL
Iron_Edge: how is that dark, some of the happiest people ive ever met don't give a shit about anything
SHOOT HIM
atoken of my gratitue
/me scoffs
HE'S RIGHT THERE
This is completely unrealistic.
JUST STEAL THE FUCKING MEAT
I can't wait till' Yahtzee will review this
yep
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THIS BAD
is it as quiet as epic-chat seems to be most of the time?
yes
CriticKitten: What the hell are you talking about?
The English would never say bastard outside a pub.
people, tell me this is easy mode.
Meanwhile: Well im not English...ya bastard....
he came
Irish_Pony: Live demo of AssCreed 3
=/
11,01E3 should be named "Sequels and Motion Controls Expo"
05tov the fuk u talking aboot
because the english ar as polite as canadians?
-_-
Meanwhile: Yes, yes I would. :D
Wrek|Dusty: Theyre watching E3 Live instead of you :P
Wrek|Dusty: I don't like that question
Irish_Pony: No you're Irish, your country is basically a pub.
woo
The British forces in this game are apparently idiots. Twenty or so guys with rifles there, not ONE shot him
CCCP: It may just be me but that just sounds heartless and too...uhh....yeah pretty much heartless. And there's never an excuse for not using manners...
E3 should be renamed "Advertisement for Video Games and Accessories" :)
Meanwhile: Oh go shave your moustache already....
For god's sake, it was close range
Never.
that and the umm
CriticKitten: what game are you guys talking about?
spike tv awards
Toby Came
11,01E3 is about advertisements.
same trailer?
CCCP: AssCreed 3
Wrek|Dusty: Have you listened to the terrible twilight fanfiction? xD
Nittany_Discord: =/
CCCP: thats like me saying "CCCP I think your awesome bro, but if you were to die right now this very second. I would careless."
Iron_Edge: manners are the most unimportant thing ever
CriticKitten You could see bullets wizzing by if you paid more attention.
still loking the same to me, kill one enemy at the time while all the others just stand around politely waiting for you to kill them
I wonder if anything about Bioshock Infinity will show up.
There's "skillful assassin" and then there's "lucky as shit"
CCCP: Thats not true! -lol- but im saying I could never honestly not care.
this is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=Vvu7oxevfyw#t=226s
amazing
Iron_Edge: i guess
pyrocatboy: Muskets were not THAT inaccurate.
wow i liek dem new kills
hi
not bad actually
Iron_Edge: well, idk
hi Quadrenaro
Bears are threats to Murica
CCCP: But it can make people respect you more and increase your standing in the community and workplace
He followed through.
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a2hmDmwX6M <- so is this
CriticKitten: is it on the stream?
pyrocatboy: At that range, he should have been hit. Muskets could hit him at close range. >_>
tobuscus gonna play
Thanks for sharing.
11,0117 people love Ubisoft.
11,01And their DRM.
CCCP: -lol- well i'll tell you what I told walldives. To each his own. But wethere or not you like it I care about you ^-^

That's a thing I've noticed.
i dislike EA so much atm....
Toby is best pony on the stage right now.
noone laughs
This guy is not a strong public speaker is he.
Nittany_Discord: That wouldn't be the executive board, would it? :D
/me hugs In_Love_Luna "I wub you" <3
11,01GilDash: Probably.
Nittany_Discord i think he was the one asking for 1 million money too
get on with it
EA has been ruining games for years. Its nothing new.
ohh toby
Aisha, shut up.
Irish_Pony: I wub you more <3
11,01Only their executive board would love such a terrible idea.
HUGS FOR EVERYPONY! :)
ESPORTS

Wow, Aisha is a bitch. :D
So is this a joke or is this guy actually ADD?
In_Love_Luna: No I wub you more <3
TOTALB
CriticKitten They were pointing at where he is, not where he will be.
ahhhh the tournament
Meanwhile hes always like this
Toby has ten thousand times the charisma of you. Just let him announce the games and you get the fuck off stage.
GET ON WITH IT!

Chrysalis: Oh dear.

Kipkat07_USAF: yeah then one day you die, and everyone forgets you in like 30 years, unless you become famous. But u dont become famous unlessu do somethins, and that has no corellation with fame. (i mean in general)
Hey hey hey Bronysith *hugs*

Irish_Pony: I wub you until my history dies <3

pyrocatboy: There's "suspension of disbelief" and then there's "bullshiting for the sake of making you seem more badass".
It's neat to watch.
Hugs CCCP :)
CCCP: Damn... reality hit you right in the balls. That is why my life goal is to be in the air force and be a war hero
Nittany_Discord: I agree there. If gaming is about fun, why would you play it not for fun? :D
Was that a word?
o.O
CS Represent
Yep, no idea who those guys are.
=/ russian
Is this thunderlane?

Quadrenaro: yep
I've heard of Spawn before, I think.

I suppose I should know but I don't, nor am I caring. >_>
well see: from what I can tell, why not give the hero kryptonite and super powers, seems more believable :)
Kipkat07_USAF: i dont have any dreams, all mine is , is to live in an apartment and thats all. and go off to mexico and die there
i dont see anything... :(

Thank god, now Aisha can shut the hell up and Toby can host.

Nittany_Discord: when wasn't EA's bad?

Nittany_Discord: mhh uhmm weelllll uhmm bad
Im only interested in Sony's conference right now
Nittany_Discord: Battlefield Super DLC, Sports, Sports, Sports, Crysis, MoH, Sports, racing, and Dead Space 3
nintendo has the only good ones
EA's was pretty lame, yes.
ubisoft was the best so far
Did the nintendo press ondefrence happen yet?
CCCP: There is other military jobs you know
Nittany_Discord: yeah EA sucked.
SuperBrony64: the Sim City MMO?
hi
YES DAY 9

Om: Seriously, no one in the crowd likes her at all. And every interaction between her and Toby is so awkward.
11,01*morons
Nittany_Discord: pc gamer for life
Bronysith: amen
GilDash: She is trying to hard. And she is nervous.
05in otehr words WingedCurse: nothing that interests me
Nittany_Discord: To give them credit, some of their stuff seems more fun then what EA was showing.
11,01Kill him!
11,01Ubi?
Wrek|Dusty: Hhhhhhha.
Luna is one funny pony... Off to my favorite episode.
http://www.freeverse.com/mac/product/?id=7022
Nittany_Discord: thats just it, its either consoles or pc, and each thinks the other sucks
Om: Toby's nervous. She's handling it pretty well.
GilDash: Like I said, Aisha is an exec trying too hard to be liked by gamers and to pretend that she's "one of them". When she's so clearly fricking not.
The first true office equipment simulator, SimStapler© brings all of the thrill and excitement of a “real” stapler right to your computer screen!
Ubisoft used a Wii U controller to demonstrate rayman origins
Wrek|Dusty: but the zombie game is called ZombieU! lol
Kipkat07_USAF: yeah i guess, but scared shitless of planes, and boats i guess could be alright, but id rather not join the navy

otakon: Regular show will be on in forty-one minutes.
This looks like it could be a really good game, actually.

Nittany_Discord: =/
What do you know, something new and originalish.
Okay, Watch Dogs is on my potentials list.
I'm....impressed, holy crap.

How long before they balls it up
good game so far
That never happens.
I probably cant afford that game anyway.
im going to join this match as soon as shes done with me
11,01Meanwhile: Not long.
GilDash: PM me
Is E3 ON the stream??????????????????????
See! Make a good looking game and people WILL praise you!
alexxm: A new IP called Watch Dogs.
CCCP: No.
11,01I know Ubi will ruin this title.
Co-op!
Meanwhile: oh
ppfffft

11,01Namely it might get always-on SP.

Nittany_Discord: They'd better keep their fucking hands off or I'll be pissed.
I doubt that black girl is a gamer
whats it about CriticKittens
Nittany_Discord: suuure
That was a damn good looking title, though. I hope that they pull this one off.
whats it about CriticKitten
Is it Night, Evening, or Afternoon for you.
<3 <3 <3 bai
damn Watch Dogs looks good
11,01If Ubi keeps their DRM out of this game, I might get it.
alexxm: It's a hacker-type game.

I can tell that this black girl is lying about being a gamer :<
bye CCCP
CCCP: later bro
Hacker type. How long before you're hacking cars and making them explode?
Nittany_Discord: Yeah, I guess that's the deal breaker for me too. I'd get it even if it were shit just because it's trying to be different.
That was probably the only good part in the game.
That made this conference worth watching
Flo Rida? Really?

I cant really say that Im interested in assasins creed
CupcakeWarrior: its overated

I told everyone that it was going to suck.
My urge to play TF2 is rising.
11,01Harmonix is EA-owned. No RB3.
Zombie U?
im the bacon man bring all the pork i can to al the little kids down the road
11,02Dat Ghosties
04WHO CARES ABOUT ZOMBI U
11,01Sucks since Harmonix did DLC right.
04The only thing we care about is Watch Dogs
That is almost as bad a name as Wii Zombie
In_Love_Luna: The you and Irish_Pony drawings are so cute!
11,01They released fewer titles and more song DLC.
11,02ZOMBIE U IS BEST GAME ON WII U
Just as I thought. TF2 would work. WHY CAN'T MY COMPUTER DIE ALREADY?!? :[
O.o
zombiU looks cool and watch doogs LOOKS FREAKING AMAZINGLY EPPPPPPPPIIIIIIIIIIC
CupcakeWarrior: :$
Hi everypony
04Seriously, Watch Dogs look amazing
Ghosties: Who cares about the Wii U at all.
CupcakeWarrior: Thanks :$
Meanwhile: SB does
Meanwhile: Ahem....
Ghosties: IKR
I really don't believe anyone actually likes the Wii U and is just trolling.
Ghosties: IKR!
My sister and I watched the preview for Assassin's Creed 3, and she said it makes her want to start playing video games again
I found 5 rl bronies last weekend. I played MLP theme in public place. It was super effective.
Meanwhile: really?
Meanwhile: Im not trolling
Really.
Meanwhile: No really....
That's what I think.
Hi StupidSexyCJ and Airpuff
Meanwhile: i really like the wii u
I cannot believe anyone would buy that.
Potential for a new Zelda game is as far as my interst goes into the Wii U
Meanwhile: Really?
REALLY.
Why do people hate the Wii U so much?
i love wii u
Meanwhile: Really?
00,03I also tried Five Guys Burgers last night, it was DOPE
Because it's a fucking stupid piece of shit.
I love the Wii U
As soon as I get a new computer then I'll get 2FT. I'm sick pf all this bull(squee) that I have to deal with on this thing. Why can't it just die. :|
I hate EA so much...
we all hate EA
Scoot-Scootaloo nice
Scoot-Scootaloo: So is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Darkts3: Oh my god yes. REAAAAAALLY
Quadrenaro: Everyone does
Snow!
Quadrenaro: same. its Evil Assholes
EA sucks but damn i love SSX
00,03Its a good thing :)
battlelog premium...
lol
Darkts3: I only like EA for SSX
$50 down the drain with that
cachi01 FUCK YEAH! /)
(\
/me starts singing along to the song, then realised it's Nickelback
Scoot-Scootaloo: Then you have officaily eaten the best burgers ever....
SSX? That still exists?
yes
Capcom generally gets on my nerves too
Has never played SSX :$
Ponies47: do it
The Wii U is just sticking an Ipod touch on your tv and giving you a bunch of redundant bullshit.
DO IT!
Meanwhile: ipad
I like SSX for the completely ridicoulous moves you can do
Bears.
I have to believe no one actually wants to buy it or I'll kill myself.
Sweet! He's gonna open crates!
Meanwhile: but its cool just give it a chance
SSX is one of my favrotie games
CMON! Something really good!!!!
If I for one second think that anyone actually wants to own a Wii U my head will fucking explode in a shower of brain matter.
Sisterhooves Social done. Off to... Cutie Pox.
Oooooooooooo
dat strange
Scoot-Scootaloo if you ever go to the GTA, check out a place called "Sonny's". It's a family owned restraunt which is based off of Big Boy.
have they said the price of it yet?
Not bad...
sup mangs
cachi01: thats what I thought about the original Wii, and then the kinect. I was wrong
cachi01: I really don't play video games because I suck at them and my bro never gets off the freakin PS3 :|
/me just buy battlefield 3 for Play Station 3 c:
00,03GTA IV?
StupidSexyCJ: the kinect was destined to fail and die

/me hugs AttackWithHugs back:)
I can't belive some people have already purchased battlelog premium. BF3 is so broken atm, why would you spend $50 on what should be built in to the game.
Meanwhile: If the Wii U can prove to me that it can be used to actually create interesting titles, I'd buy one.
AttackWithHugs... Been a long time.

AttackWithHugs: Yeah you've missed a lot of dumb happenings.

Great another shitstorm about how we hate Regular Show and Aisha Tyler.

Ponies47: Ed Edd and Eddy?
Irish_Pony: dat otakon
Ed Edd N Eddy ftw

Somebody explain it :<

HML its not really a joke
is it DLC related

Irish_Pony: BEST FREAKIN CARTOON EVER! :)
7:57/6:57c. 3 minutes to go until REGULAR SHOW.
2I'm not getting the links :<
Ponies47: /)
2Just random blank space
I only really like the Margaret episodes of Regular Show.
buttered toast
Oh, and Pops
2Then again, Mibbit
MahBoi777: It's crap to me :|
Pops is best Loli
Irish_Pony: I don't want to know how you found that.
nice, staraptor
Lolli
Ponies47: it's random, I like it
00,10demopan?
Irish_Pony: (\ Best of the Cartoon Cartoons
/me is on chapter 20 of his, still going x.x
Meanwhile: Group picture :P
7:58/6:58c. Two minutes.

Irish_Pony: Which begs the question of what groups you follow. -_^
billy and mandy was best cartoon
^
IS*
MahBoi777: I use to like it. Then I realized how dumb it was :|
Sumica: I actually created Demopan 2 :P
plus EA wanting you to think you're jusy buying the right to play the game they made
2You can do eet :D
I dont get why everybody is hating on the Microsoft press conference. Im watching it now and im about 20 min in and its not bad.
Meanwhile: #Bronies :P
03Nick, and this is why I don't buy games anymore
03it's that simple
can't wait for Halo 4
yeah
But Ubisoft is on right now
It's one minute to 8/7c/5p.
LOL
ubi already ended
Irish_Pony: I'll just pretend you never told me, for the sake of my mental well being.
Meanwhile: :D:D:D:D
IMO So far, Ubisoft > EA > MS
oh gawd
I bought SR3 pre-owned and even then I dont wanna play it because of all the DLC and online pass :\
and yes Ran, I'm just really anxious to finish it before I go off to college ^^;
CupcakeWarrior: Im watching it on gametrailers
I want to give it to my parents as a parting gift of sorts
Meanwhile: This is why were friends :D
Its still on Ubisoft
Ubisoft needs moar social networking
It's 8/7c now. Regular Show is showing on Cartoon Network.
Hello!
YAY
hello tag365
which is why I never play online on my 360 anymore
03LOL
03well
/me sings the theme song to Regular Show.
03at least with Xbox Live, you're paying for *actual quality service*
03LOL PSN
MBBWOOOOOOOOOWM
mfw people like regular show
03LOL NINTENDO USING FRIEND CODES
03Granted, some games are just a bunch of 12-year olds cussing each other out
03others are just a bunch of 20-year olds cussing each other out
So who is playing?
03it's all in waht games you choose to play :P
I dunno what PSN is like I dont have a PS3/Vita (although thinking about)
sagas: wrek
and yeah that too
03I signed up for PSN and then it got hacked
Wow, Wrek is good with a sword
03which was funny as heck, I'll admit
which is why I've changed my gaming focus to quality single player games
03as Sony deserves it
CupcakeWarrior: Viking blood.
cachi01: Is he playing with anyone in the chat or others?
03but how long it took them to get it back online
03was just hilarious
yeah
I hate Cartoon Network now. They ruined everything. :|
03and Nintendo online is a joke, if you meet someone in-game, good luck playing against them ever agan
^
03*again
For those in europe, It's 2am/1am UK now.
Ponies47: /)
lol
03so as much as people whine about paying for Xbox Live, consider the fact that it *actually works*
sagas: he is playing with Bronysith, FlareChaser|TF2 and i think thats it
SSBB online
xD
god almighty
Irish_Pony: (\
well, they got that friday night thing now where they play some of the old cartoons for an hour :/
Better_Luna: Are you feeling any better? :(
tooncast?
or top top toons?
XD
Yeah,I'm happy now :)
lol
03still
cachi01: I forgot the name
lol
Gamer_Luna: HUZZAH
Gamer_Luna: yay <3
Better_Luna: Why do you keep changing your name every time I see you!?!
Here in the phillipines, Oggy and the Cockroaches is practicaly on Cartoon Network "all day everyday".
/me noms on Irish_Pony
and yeah it does, but with the new trends of online passes, server rentals, premium services and nickel and diming and the fact I grew bored/frustrated by onlin gaming (ala screaming people over mikes) I have very little initiative to play online
03LOL yeah I know what you mean
sagas: Because I have diffirent feelings :)
03luckily I don't play games that involve screaming people over mics
To the moon Demopan
Gamer_Luna: That makes sense
03like, people say Xbox 360 and everybody assumes COD and Halo, I won't touch either series with a 10 foot pole :P
And that was Cutie Pox... Not really one of my favorite episodes. Off to... My the Best Pet Win. Song episode. SOngs are nice
03Minecraft on the other hand
yeah, I was in with a great crowd when I played l4d online
/me hides
After Cartoon Network launched Flapjack that's when they went to hell :|
great MP that game
2The only online game I really play that involves people using mics is WoW
03I used to play L4D2 a lot
OH FLAPJACK XD
^
03kinda got bored though
Dat air launch
2And if you're in a good group, everyone is so friendly
DONT GO TO BREAD
Ponies47: God damn that pancake.....
Flapjack was.......I dunno
I played both tonnes loved the freaking thing
wha? you guys were watching ponies?
Chowder was the last good show on CN
flapjack was flapjack
Dken2021: I am. :P
Chowder was ok
CupcakeWarrior: MINE! *Grabs Irish_Pony and runs away*
chowder was AMAZING
I hated Chowder :|
it was simple, you just needed to play as a good team no unlocking the next weapon/class/w/e
It had its good moments
Never saw Flapjack. I loved what little I saw of Chowder.
Gamer_Luna: <3
how many episodes you got left Ninjazz|Challenge?
03er wait
03unlocking in L4D?
03o.,o
03-,
I disliked Total Drama Island
Irish_Pony: <3
Dken2021: S2 E7... 19 left.
I felt like killing myself the first time I saw Flapjack
total drama island was ok
plus it wasnt a straightforward soldier vs soldier FPS the infected was really great to play as
well I'm just dropping by
Ohai Dken2021
You and me both, CupcakeWarrior.
no I didn't say that I said there was none of that
Total Drama Island was meh
i liked flapjack
I didn't care for Chowder. I thought it was utterly stupid.
allo CupcakeWarrior :D
ohai
03yeah but you played both of what agme then
Welcome back to us, Dken2021. :3
>deciding between watching bronystate and playing tf2
>bronystate is streaming tf2 gameplay
I have taken to just /ignore ing anyone who roleplays excessively
Dken2021: Are you watching E3 right now?
Hey CountDoofus!
for a canadian cartoon, TDI was ok
you just needed to use teamwork and valve /really/ forced that which was a good thing
wait sony stream already started??
l4d 1 & 2
Chowder did have its really good moments though :P
CupcakeWarrior nah, taking class break now
03er
03oh
Dken2021: MLP FIM is canadian
03I see
I just had a whole pizza. That should give me enough carbs to watch the PS show.
03I was misreading that
dat Taokaka spray
pony sprays everywhere
ok
Do you guys know OMG facts?They should do MLP facts :D
00,10run faster engi
i want that rarity one
03yeah Left 4 Dead is nice, I just got tired of it
If you do that the terrorists win.
03there's only so much you can play the same game over and over before you start hating it
and my instructor is back, brb
After Ed Edd n' Eddy was cancelled that's when Cartoon Network died to me. :|
Tao is a silly kitty
Gamer_Luna: Whats OMG facts?
03at least that's how I am
I dont have pony sprays...not that big of a fan...yet....
00,10how do you break it by using it?
EE&E
im a good boy
Yeah I did overplay it
you can
E3
i miss billy and mandy :(
how was EA? crappy as usual?
DINNER TIEM
sparkle sparkle sparkle
sagas: http://www.omg-facts.com/?utm_source=Taste%20Of%20Awesome&utm_medium=Spartz&utm_campaign=TopHat
Dken2021: indeed
you can break a teleporter by using it if the exit is under a low roof
Ponies47: For me it was when the last sesaon started
I don't even remember EA
But ofcourse, Dken2021.
thing is I felt it wasn't updated enough vs say tf2
only i liked about ea was dead space 3
Ponies47: The greatest cartoon I had ever watched until MLP!
then instead of teleporting you explode the exit
Watch Dogs does not interest me
hello evry pony
hey
hi geeky-brony
oh yeah, EA had Crysis
ok it had 3 dlc packs but that was over both games I really did expect more from valve
hello cachi01
and crysis
CupcakeWarrior: When they started going to school those where ok.
03TF2 is the same thing though, I don't get how people can play that forever
Sorry, is this Dead Space or Lost Planet, I'm confused now.
Hello geeky-brony.
03it's just a game
00,10sapper tech
whats up Ninjazz|Challenge
completely blanked on EA's conference
00,10they have improved it
hry geeky-brony
Skylands you there mate?
03play it a while, get tired, move on to something else :P
All those teleporters and sentries
is this half life 2?
hay superretroworld
sagas: /)
:<
Sony is going to stream on here, is that right?
All those machines!
AttackWithHugs: Build ALL the sentries!
the lifespan of that thing increased dramatically though when it was f2p then introduced the hats
Erect ALL the dispensers!
Awwwww chat laaag
(\ For Jawbreakers!
sony will stream here right?'
have you fixed it yet?
Sumica: They have the technology...they have the technology to make sappers stronger, faster, smarter...
ya
and it got lots of maps on top of infinite mods
03why do people even care about hats
harder better faster stronger
enough time to rewatch Korra twice
yeah
I miss Duck Dogers :(
Ponies47: (\ For Jaw Breakers!
but it made valve a crap tonne of dough
00,10or perhaps it was a realy bad engi and he was some how upgrading the sapper
03it's like people obsessing over avatar items on the Xbox
03it's silly
03oh I'm sure
sagas: JAWBREAKERS /)
Ok, who just pinged me? Chat lagged.
03but people are stupid and will pay for anything
AttackWithHugs: Build ALL the sentries!
DUCK DODGERS TO THE RE--*explodes*
03which is exactly why EA still exists :P
Erect ALL the dispensers!
Watch_Dogs intrigued me.
2If it makes them happy, then that's why
but honestly paying real money for virutal items?
Meanwhile: Sap ALL the sentries!
Hehe, erect
watch dogs gave me a nerdgasm
03I've done it a few times for XBL but very rarely
Ponies47: (\ GRAVY!
Watch Dogs looks like it could be genuinely intersting.
AttackWithHugs: ALL the sentries? :C
2We pay money for games :P
03most of those avatar items I don't bother with
CupcakeWarrior: -_(\
The Looney Tunes Show ONLY because of Lola Bunny
/me gives Ponies47 buttered toast
2Essentially virtual things
Ponies47: /) BUTTERTOAST!
03I don;t pay money for games, what are you talking about
/me runs
sagas: GRAVY! /)
2Excluding you then, lol
03nah, I do sometimes
Meanwhile: ALL the sentries! *Lesson Zero TS face*
yeah that's the thing ran and its also the same reason people are against digital download games
03well
Ponies47: (\ CHICKENS!
AttackWithHugs: >_> Ok then...
later guys!! ^^
/me erects a sentry
03in all fairness, digital downloads are the way to go
Irish_Pony: BUTTERTOAST /)
They're putting Friends on Nick at nite! :D
bye Quadrenaro
03discs get scratched and damaged
03and think of stuff like L4D
03you buy the DVD
Gamer_Luna: Yay~
sagas: SCOOTALOO'S /)
Gamer_Luna: they already did that
03all it does is install it to Steam
Gamer_Luna: DAFUQ WHY?
its just the feeling that they're paying real money for something that really, doesn't exist, it's virtual
Gamer_Luna: hello
03and then you toss the disc in a closet and it collects dust
2Aye
03which is why >paying money
i dont like friends
03you see where I'm coming from?
/me hides
What's the name of this map? I forgot but I have played it before.
I feel their should be a cartoon throwback to about 8 years ago
yeah drf but all games digital or not will get servers shut down
like EA's
03which is why >piracy
Ponies47: PONIES /)
Ponies47: (\ PLANK!
03Then you can play it all you want
03and not bother with the stupid DRM
03what's your point LOL
/me hugs geeky-brony "Hey Bro!"
what server is this?
Duck Dodger's was ok. Unlike that other Looney Tunes Show *Shivers*
yeah...its stuff like that that pushes piracy
Gamer_Luna: good how u
03exactly.
doesn't stop it
03it's why I don't buy games for the most part
Ponies47: /) Erm...CANKCARS!
the new looney tunes show is cool
00,10captain obvious to the rescue
2I love buying games I know I'll enjoy
Sumica: YA!
03I buy all of the Humble Indie Bundles because those make a point of being DRM-free
cachi01: Pizzariba!
03and they let you pay what you want
superretroworld: (\ PONIES!
03well how would you know if you like a game just from watching footage?
sagas: PLANK! /)
basically what it is as my dad says: 'we are customer, customer pays your wages, you need to give customer what customer wants, not what you want'
03It's like movie trailers, it could be complete garbage for all you know
2Because I know myself pretty well
/me laughs just by recalling Lola Bunny
03yeah but I mean preordering games
geeky-brony: Great! Irish_Pony hasn't left yet,so I'm very happy :)
2Or I borrow someone's game
03how do you know it's any good :P
03if it's not even out
Gamer_Luna: <3
2I don't buy new games
Gamer_Luna: lol
03>Diablo 3
Irish_Pony: (\ CANKCARS!
2I've waited for that for 10 years :P
Lola is the one that makes all blondes look stupid.
/me explodes
ZAMBAMBOES
03people waited even longer for Duke Nukem Forever
03and it sucked
i buy games, but don't play them
03what of it :P
I want to kick her sometimes.
2I don't like Duke Nukem, that's what :P
Still Lola was hilarious only because the rest of the looney tunes were toned down and boring.
AttackWithHugs: Hey im blonde :[
The Looney Tunes Show is a joke. :|
oh god DNF
03my Steam library has like 120 games
what an embrassment
03I've played all of... 2?
but 40K and MLP have already been crossed I'm pretty sure
That guy must not have seen the 40K crossover pics.
the looney tunes show is awesome
/me never liked Looney Tunes
they tried to make lola a sex symbol, so gross
Okay guys, just came in to say hi
Yeah my thoughts exactly Athgaar.
well, i buy boxed games once every few months
Irish_Pony: Not talking about you. talking about Lola from Looney Tunes show. Just...*shudder*
i don't really buy online ones
Well hi otakon
Talking to friends, say everypony. That just happend to me
08,01hey otakon
ssame here jun
03boxed games these days are just downloads burned to a disc though
superretroworld: thats wat they tried to do in the first place, now she's just insane
Season 2 of Looney Tunes is pretty much a reboot. I hope the show is fixed.
03I'll only do that if it's cheaper
08,01btw, i need to plug something right now
lol
listen guys, I'm going for now
03like the L4D games were exactly the same price on disc as on STeam
03>free coaster
03why not
Warhammer 40k crossover with mlp fic. Ha! It does exist! http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-luna-heresy.html
00,10that is an evil looking shotty
so, I'll see you all later on
take care!
Dat kick.
Bye otakon! *hugs*
Bye bye otakon :)
08,01for all you European bronies (and non-Euoprean bronies, actually): the John de Lancie brony documentary is coming to Europe. But to do this, they require additional funding, of an extra $70,000
Too late AttackWithHugs otakon got booted by the kickbot.
superretroworld: /)
no. Tex Avery was the king of slapstick
Meanwhile: what'd he do?
You guys know that Spongebob is 25? :O
Ponies47: (\
08,01if you can, please go to their kickstarter and donate: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary
actually I just remembered
AttackWithHugs: Too many posts in 10 seconds.
spongbob is 25? :l
dafuq
boom
Gamer_Luna: Spongebob was cancelled after the movie >.>
i thought he was like 17
Meanwhile: Oh silly otakon. Always triggering the kick bots *awesomeface*
After the movie that's when Spongebob went to hell. :|
08,01and is truly global and wide reaching
SQUIDWARDS SUICIDE
08,01not to mention universal
08,01</plug>
spongebobs a kid
we are everywhere
08,01apologies to whoever is streaming for plugging during their stream
AttackWithHugs: Ikr. Some things never change.
08,01but i really needed to get that out there
I watched a vid of Jim sterling and talked about stupid pricing of DD games and how devs/pubs will still charge the same price despite their saying it'll be cheaper for them (but not for you) and this game on Vita's PSN store is like $40
03which is again
03why I don't buy games
same game is 69cents on iPhone
Spongebob is 25,go check it on on a spongebob site,he is. :)
PONIES FTW! /)
someday I'll watch all the Spongebob episodes that I missed over the years
08,01sagas: not as big as you'd think
Meanwhile: nope
discord im howling at the moon, sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
/me looks at tv
08,01sagas: well, that's a blatant lie
Ponies47: (\
08,01it's probably bigger than you can possibly imagine
at this moment I can understand :\
08,01well, Wrek's one of BUCK's guests of honour, so i'm sure he won't mind
08,01inb4 he kicks me just to prove me wrong :P
/me has watched all the spongebob episodes
03I always enjoy when people refuse to pirate stuff and then go around whining about how expensive games are
03At least I actively do something about that >_>
2That burglar alarm
and also the fairy godparents before the poof saga
I haven't bought a new game since november (not counting skyrim which was preowned not new)
2Is actually starting to get to me
I never watched Pokemon but some of the music it has is awesome! :)
Oh boy, Sony time
sony already starte
sooo
03the only stuff I consider bu ying used is "legacy" games, like cartridges
My Little Sony
03new games, what'st he point?
streaaaaam
I HATE POOF! :[
Ponies47: The music was so cheesey! Even for the 90s!
I hate Pokemon :[
what's wrong with poof
i used to wonder why technology would be
what is poof even
Y u no push cart?!
Irish_Pony: wat
That's like hating toast
On the episode where Spongebob stole his Driver's License.The card said 25,so his 25 :)

Fire_Mad_Luna: But...I wub you...:(....<3
brbrbrbrbrbr
Calcos323: The fact that it's a new IP doesn't change the fact that it's a repackage of something we've seen and hated already,
Om: TheRainbowDash freakin' keeps drinking mine. :<
CriticKitten: I don't care. It's not called Heavy Rain 2. It's a new IP.
In B4 Aliens attack

Fire_Mad_Luna: Horrible? I've been called all kinds of nice things, even by Irish_Pony. ;)

GilDash: You play nice?
there hear
00,10(\ Bronysith
She's behind you!!!
Calcos323: Also, would rather buy a half-assed sequel than a shitty new IP. Guess that just makes me one of those silly gamers who would rather have an average game in a known franchise than a terrible new one.
Fire_Mad_Luna: :'(....Dont take it that way...please....PLEASE....:'(
Fire_Mad_Luna: don feel bad
00,10a pager realy?
inb4 psychicsplosion!
CriticKitten: That's not my point, bro
Sumica: IKR
So when does this game become a game?
00,10so this takes place in the early 80's
'cuz I'm pretty sure he said this was a game
The graphics in this is kick ass though.
dont do it man
CriticKitten: probably in 2019
Om: I always play nice. ;)
Yet I have yet to see a GAME here
inb4 the game is a bunch of QTEs like Heavy Rain
mario_pony: Super (2010)
its a trap
GilDash: News to me.
00,103....2......1
It's a very pretty cutscene, but not a game
CupcakeWarrior: heavy rain was a good movie
11,01Maybe the town is technologically behind.
Man, i suck at this.
GilDash: did you even see her coment?
So I finally got on TF2
Sumica: BOOO
wat?
Bronysith: lol
I feel like i'm watching movie night
lol Om
Irish_Pony: Ahh... no?
i dont get it
I dun geddit
ZombiiU was just a cutscene and that didn't stop us from cheering.
not E3 conference stream
Yeah, so....this is just a trailer, you lying sack of shit dev. :|
this looks Amazing
GilDash: Scroll up to her last comment....
Irish_Pony: Too busy with Om it seems.
It's hard to call Heavy Rain a game, but I enjoyed it nontheless
she is to op
GilDash: Getting distracted are we?
oh Hai LEAH
mario_pony: ikr
"This is totally the game!" NO, it's clearly not.
Wow...
whoa, i just realised a whole bunch of people said hey to me earlier for no reason 0.o
So I missed the start of this presentation, is this supposed to be like a spiritual successor to Heavy Rain?
Is this a game a or film or the boundries becoming less defined?
Ivan?
Oh the stream is uncensored lol
dat game
Irish_Pony: I'm doing too much right now...
Irish_Pony: I'll stay for you,but if I cry on my keybored....
not IVAN! nooooooooooooo
Calcos323: it was an interesting game. i loved the story
well back to whatever i was doing
Interesting looking.
11,01So, gameplay?
GilDash: And you're probably tired. >:3
Nope
Amazing Gameplay
Beyond Feels like a real movie at least unlike all these Michael bay games.
So, that wasn't a game.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Like you are.
00,10what you wanted to play the game nitt?
Bronysith: That's why I played it. It was like the ultimate interactive movie, and I am MORE than OK with that
ND|Busy: no one cares for gameplay in this day and age lol
C'mon God of war!!
ND|Busy, lolno
/me hugs Fire_Mad_Luna

*Logic?
Golden_Mic: Would that be "bring developed by Nintendo"?
For everyone wondering who "Fat Princess" is, FP is the titular character in which you, a soldier, have to carry FP to a goal. You feed her to make it harder for the opponents to carry her back to their base.
Golden_Mic: *being
This game is just a crappy rip-off of SSB!
This years e3 has been soooo shite

Reikim: We can hope and dream they would
Personally, for games like that, the bigger the screen played on, the better
Scoot-Scootaloo: (In nasely fanboy silly tone) What's wrong with you? Shooters are only to be played on PCs.
Serriously... I still think AC3 is ganna SUCK.

Wow that broadside demolished.
Golden_Mic: :|
This doesn't really seem that cool
that's actually pretty cool :) Im impressed
I feel they should do an assassins creed where the assassins are pirates and the templars are the royal navy
this is something.
mfw 3 days of school left
twilight_sprinkle: I do not know that.
This could be really really good or really really BAD
No HUD? Maybe its the Wii U version
I think this game looks amazing...

ib4 ACIII is show in Nintendo's conference
What game is this?
But is there a Twilight Sparkle minigun?
See ya Dken2021.
i never play any assassin creed games

that might change soon
GilDash: Not really thinking very well today, I havent a clue.
I do recal Sumica playing TF2.

When AC3 is shown on Nintendo Sony is probably going to copy it
11,01I just have reservations based on their past.
Ghosties: Hey, this series had tower defense already
Two terrible games and ideas, followed by two games NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THEIR CONSOLES.
twilight_sprinkle: He's such a loser. He doesn't even have a freakin job. All he does is just sit around and get drunk :|
/me hugs PinkiePieCopy
/me kisses om.
SuperBrony64: It is

Hi Ghosties!
/me kisses Om.
This guy's voice is so freakin tactical.
04But tower defense is boring :/
Dat OST
/me hugs TheRainbowDash :(
11,01They're not a smart company.
04But SHIP BATTLES
SuperBrony64, yes, AC3 comes out on Wii U
04HORY SHET
ND|Busy: Ubi makes either incredibly lousy games or incredibly good ones. It's a mixed bag.
What do you mean? I've liked A.C. II so far much more than A.C 1
8,6tower defense is awesome
This is kinda boring
So thus far, Sony has shown us nothing that is both their product AND cool
Ponies47: did you talk to your mother about it?
titties!
TOSS A NAAAAAAADE
11,02Ghosties: IKR
GilDash: Cant spell such a simple name? My brain isn't the only one on a stall.
I AM... PLACING THE BOMB NAO
11,01Ubi makes bad decisions.
AWESOME
If I wanted to socialize, I wouldn't play video games
Ghosties, what about Tower Defense with Ship Battles?
ND|Busy: Like what?
00,10kirzstryfe, you should try dungion defender
11,02Though I still have to beat the first Assassin's Creed :3
Om: Blame my hooves. They're busy elswhere. ;)
11,01Their DRM was a huge mistage.
twilight_sprinkle: She knows that he get's drunk. :|
11,01SuperBrony64: Same.
O_O
8,6never liked the 3d version of TD games
Ponies47: RAAAAAAAAA
GilDash: I blame your as a whole.
stab
SuperBrony64: Same here too.
Assassin's Creed 1 was BLOODY repetitive
Ubi loves Nintendo though
AMAZING
I skipped the first one after playing a little bit of it. I love 2, but never finished it.
/me has never played AC
but bloody repetitive
geeky-brony: wha? :O
Ghosties: Oh, sorry, i must've misunderstood you.
Ponies47: sucks... stay strong and study hard and then youll be your own man
WELCOME TO RUSSIA HAHA
I always love nintendo ._.
ND|Busy: I havent seen the ubi conference, but they better not have screwed up Rayne Man!
Ive Finishes all the AC games so far

Ubisoft gave us Red Steel 2 and No More Heroes.
FlareChaser|Assassin: Do you like the Wii U?
I never played past the tutorial in AC1. What's better in part 2?
04Tower Defense with ship battles is still fine
We all love The Wii U
CupcakeWarrior: I think the Wii U will be decent.

Watch Dogs FTW
Renard: :D
Stallion_of_Assassin: thank you :3
CCCP: It would be raided by the police
SuperBrony64: Just because she puts her name on it doesn't mean she wants her face on it.
GET ON WITH IT!
EVERYPONY! POST LINKS
04Man, Watch Dogs

Ghosties: Ubisoft's was surprisingly good,a ctually.
Quadrenaro: looks cool but needs better photo res

THANG GOD FOR BUFFERS
04That game looks sooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooood
JUST SAY ITS ON PHONES DUDE
Welsh_Pony: Unless they're fanmade. Fighting is Magic will fix that.

SirGanjalf: That's awesome.

11,02WOOO NAME CHANGE...NOW BRING ME GAMES
LOL
Nintendo already wins E3 for me
I wish the damn publishers would shut up and let the game devs speak.
Ghosties, E³ is about Electronic Entertainment.
GUYS IF U HAVE A XPERIA PLAY THIS MAY BE INTERASTING
0,5Oh i got it right
Ghosties: E3 is about money. Always has been,
00,10what an inovative name
0,5yyay
Ponies47: Break for E3.
Wut
Beyond, SSBM ripoff, and Ubisoft games

SirGanjalf: I am in awe.
FAt fuck gtfo off the stage
The PS3 wont be printing money this year

Kandarihu: Honestly, using a tablet you already own will be cheaper and probably better
BOOOOOOO!
04Boring
this sucks
00,10what a shock
Multiplayer in this?... :S
TheBest rockstar doesn't need E3
I need a ps3 so I can play God of War

E3 = Full of CoD players.
Oh, it's this guy.

Ninjazz|Challenge: I think it is.
God of War....?
Eh, he'll be fine
and I am coming on BS less and less because im busy which is never a good thing. I should be on a lot more now though i should think :)
02Did you know Nintendo fixed a few glitches on MK7 that peoples were using to cheat?
mario_pony: lol
I though this series was finished...
Multiplayer in GOW?
god of war :o
Well at least it's not a freaking book.
WAT
SuperBrony64: Its a prequel
HOLY SHIT GOD OF WAR
this is a prequel
Where's Valve? :'(
FlareChaser|Assassin: inb4 the Nintendo presentation is the best of the lot.
thinking of new games is like...hard....
lol kratos
ouch
god of war
He looks so real
0.o
You should be.
Reikim: it will be! :D
SuperBrony64: It was left with an open ending. . . For this very reason.
CAPRICOOOORN
00,10oh I though that was a quest givver
We'll always remember you, random sword guy!
Be here for the Nintendo presentation at least.

Ninjazz|Challenge: Because you don't have high expectaions of Sony.
RUNNING IN THE 90'S!
maabey they are turning into zombies Gumri
Its the same game, but with different thing
s
oh when is that? I got the time wrong for the Sony one, having thought that starts when it finishes :/
rofl... Goatmen seem original
inb4 he gets all his equipment taken away at the beginning.
:O
WE NEED BLIZZARD AT E3.
Om: Does anyone have High ecpectations of any of these companies? :S
Om: Most major publishers in fact.
Starts at 9.
/me Stallion_of_War
Sumica: "I seem to have this sword stuck in my back! Those fierce minotaurs did this to me! Kill them please! Quest: Kill 0/3 Minotaurs."
...
still as violent as ever
00,10wow and that weapon was just in some guys back
Everything seems sooooo booooring after that interactive book presentation
FlareChaser|Assassin: blizz is too good for that
An open ending, so that the franchise can end when the publisher wants it to, not the devs?
WE NEED PONIES AT e3
GilDash: Ehhh. No. I guess not
THIS PLEASES US!
any idea what that is GMT?
It's a prequel, Reikim, so he shouldn't have the weapons to begin with.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Yeah....
11,02Let's see...Microsoft let me down...Sony isn't doing anything spectacular yet...oiy....
This looks exactly the same as it previose games. Exactly what they do with the MW series, only even worse
00,10Nice CriticKitten
11,02NINTENDO
OOOOOO
or what timezone 9 is?
02All the cheating was getting annoying
oh look... god of war... hoe eciting
meh
SuperBrony64: EA only said stuff about DLC.
Um, who pinged?
SuperBrony64: Inb4 they fail as well.
SuperBrony64, nope. Not even Nintendo.
02I refused to cheat
/me is from the future
I'll Take 50!!!
00,10can we atleast make sure the guy demoing the game is good at it?
NINTENDO, SONY AND UBISOFT R REALLY MAKING MY DAY :)
By the way, how was Microsoft?
I think I'll just stop playing.
Still looks like a lot of button mashing to me, though
Why yes, it's God of War. We get it.
And that's it
11,02Nintendo has a new console, they're going to own all.
FlareChaser: Dead space 3.
wheres the sss ranked combos what a nub
FINALLY! Now I can go take a shower. I'll be back in about 10-15 min or so everypony :)
ITS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUSE GOD OF WAR GAMES! NOTHING NEW!
Um. 9 PDT
But their new console sucks
Renard: no it isnt
SuperBrony64: until Gaben announces hl3 :D
11,02WITH HD graphics and 1st-Party titles that have yet to see the HD treatment
SO MUCH INNOVATION
:o
So when's that in Eastern/Central?
KRACKEN
sagas: DON'T CARE; MORE ME
NINTENDO WILL KICK ASS AND WII U IS AWESOME
wat
wtf?
I'M GETTING OVERWHELMED BY ALL THE INNOVATION
/me join #cursors
What time is nintendo tomorrow?
So now they're moving onto Norse gods?
.....
11,02That would be funny if they announce HL3, a PS3 Exclusive.
realease the kracken
RELEASE THE KRACKEN!
SuperBrony64: I will be there, and I will fangasm so hard.
So we have books, the Playstation Phone, and God of War whatever.
The Kracken! All Right!
What...
INB4 EVERYONE FAILS, BUT THEN GABE COMES OUT SAYING: L4D3 and HL3 IS GONNA BE OUT SOON.
wut
Haven't seen anything original yet.
SuperBrony64: pffflol ouch
And now he's suddenly defying time?
can i talk spanish ?
See you tommarow guys
SuperBrony64, that woudl illogically hillarious
lol
see ya pyro
SuperBrony64: The most hilarious thing that could possibly happen? HL3 on Wii U.
SuperBrony64: Oh that would be so hillarious.
02XD
SPIKE U GROW UP?
o-O
right that's 4am where i am :/
Y u no announce MLP games?
Aanndd GT stream failed misserably
Did....did he just rewind time?
ah well i'll stay on :D
00,10I saw that same trick in redfaction arma
WOWOWOO PRINCE OF WAR?
Well, Nintendo's going to be out the gate with their new console before the others. And that pretty much means that the 720 and PS4 will be new and fresh when the WiiU becomes familiar.
4 am. Dammit.
SUDDENLY, Left 4 Dead 3.
Why does he have this power?
lol
So God of War is now going to shamelessly steal an idea from Prince of Persia?
I believe I'm in that timezone too...
Wonder why it failed
INNOVATION
FlareChaser|Assassin: I am couting on it!
11,02Reikim: You at E3? O.O
No Kracken fight in the demo? :|
so whats about RDR ? :o
Observerpony_1472: cause he's Kratos that's why
IT'S SO INNOVATIVE I CAN'T TAKE IT
Ninjazz|Challenge: I want it! D:
oops
L4d3 woudl bundel p-erfectly with ep3, hl3, and portal 3
Team Fortress 3! :D
SuperBrony64: No, I mean, I'll be here fangasming. I only wish >.>
looks boring...
why portal 3
11,02IKR ;A;
Oh Hai Kracken
if you are in a similar spot to Britain then yes
RELEASE THE KRACKEN
That's more like it :)
MASH X to not die
Whatever. I might as well look at it this way. Wii U is coming before the EMP.
Wow this guy sucks
awww :'(
FlareChaser|Assassin: Dude, serriously, Orange Box 2. L4D2, HL3, and TF3. I swear, man.
11,02Wow...like I haven't seen this a million times before ._.
I always like Kratos for just being a miserable bugger who guts everyone he meets.
hammerteim
Needs more Portal 3, Half-Life 3, and Left 4 Dead 3.
Kratos saved someone?
Wow the guy demoing the game sucks
Quadrenaro: you're boring:|
Thats new.
Needs more ANYTHING ELSE
00,10so um, what is new about this game?
SuperBrony64: Like I haven't seen everything on the Wii U a million times before.
QTEs!
l4d3*
i was kicked ;_;
Ninjazz|Challenge: you know how much money that'll get?
mario_pony :P
the guy playing is a NOOOOB
Oh
Sumica, Giant enemy crabs?
Well crap, no
FlareChaser|Assassin: Exactly... :3
it looks pretty?
Great. I got kicked from #cursors and I dont even know what it is about
Sumica: The number at the end of the title.
so spain, very west of france and west africa
imagine if he failed a button mashing sequence
Protip: Get a good player to demo your gam
00,10seems leget
With how well valve wrapped up portal 2 I would not be amazed to see a portal 3, or even like a portal prequil
xD
hm I thought you were streaming E3 and not one of the old God of War titles...>.>
Nah, I'm in east Canada, so I'll be 3 or so hours behind.
There is no number at the end of this one, FillyFlam :P
Remember how you said "God I wish boss battles were full of QTEs in God of War"? YOU'VE BEEN HEARD
cupcaaaaaakes so sweet & tasty
yay for commercials! -_-
sagas: same ;_;
Darkts3: MADNESS MADNESS EVERYWHERE
Needs more quicktime.
OtakuTom: ...So absolutely nothing, then.
Wait, is E3 already going?

ha. It's always useful to know what time you are in relation to GMT+00
Ok, so Kratos is hacking and slashing monster#265, can we move on?
Thats one angry pachaderm
SuperBrony64: alright, I lost all faith in everything else except Valve, Blizzard, and Nintendo.
Dumbo Dude!
CriticKitten: why was i kicked?
This looks like the end of the new Clash of the Titans to me
oh it's a Loxo. they stole that from the monster manual 2
00,10Sure it looks nice
CCCP: I'unno
This is so god damn stupid
sooo.... are they trying to show off inovative stuff? or are they just broign an audiance?
DuskStarshimmer: now that Chell is free, there needs to be a Half-Life/Portal crossover.
because then you can work out what time it is in other places
SirGanjalf: NO, WE WILL NOT MOVE ON. YOUR STALLION OF WAR WISHES TO WATCH THIS!
RAGE
CriticKitten: yes u do :|
wow really? spam it
I think I had enough of this in GoW3...
00,10but eh so what it's been done, by you guys already
I dunno, this is kind of underwhelming.
SirGanjalf: This is exactly like every other God of War. Nothing new here
Kratos' new spam move for mugen.
Kandarihu, that would be nice to see, seing as how thier based in the same mythical russian teratory
seriously, how is this different from any other GoW game? :)
CCCP: Yeah no, I don't
INB4 BLIZZARD COMES IN ANNOUNCING WARCRAFT 4
AllisZerofuu: why was i kicked? ;_;

A new game? You can't be serious?
Meanwhile: google it.

ND|Busy: ya its new

Gamer_Luna: I LOVE THOSE!
only 4 bullets
Stealth Mode
Golden_Mic: There will be zombies/monsters
also, technically "zombie" isnt proper descriptor for anything
Reikim: lolwut

Gamer_Luna said something without Iron_Pony flirting! Impossibru!
So many beeps
00,10damn tourist
Uncharted with less shooting? Hey, why not
It looks a lot like Uncharted or the like right now, there's a distinct lack of zombies
is this a rockstar game?
inb4 protecting the girl becomes a hassle.
oh god the Ai is embarassing the player
Holy shit...
it looks to well lit to be a rockstar game, nm
DuskStarshimmer: naughty dog
It's poetic justice, I think. Crash Bandicoot got his start ridiculing Mario for being so far behind the times. Nowadays Mario has innovated more, and Sony's ditched him in favor of almost ordinary humans.
DuskStarshimmer: Naughty Dog.
This game still looks meh
still, im inb4 zombies show up
00,10wait non regening health?! what an inovation
Surprise hobo
Darkts3: Not sure if good thing or bad.

This game has already earned itself a rank up.
Now this looks fun.
This game looks really good
Athgaar: Others chose a different bland color
inb4 that girl is annoying as fuck
WOW AN IA THAT FUCKING WORKS
Audience applauds for a useful partner, isn't that a damning statement for the industry?
What's that? An AI that helps??
Darkts3: Things are looking up here!
Last of Us, people. Put in on your watchlist.

Yeah. I'm gonna have to turn this down because all the language.

A game where combat focuses on innovation and careful conservation of ammo. I'm liking this. Nice contrast to the CoD-type shooters.

Sony failed the whole presentation except the last 2
04ZOMG
Ghosties: LOL
WINTER WRAP UP!
How long untill nintendo?

The essence of "Buy buy buy" is what's ruined gaming for me.
Sony sucked, Microsoft sucked....
so manny tiny baby people
Well, this E3 is terrible
OH LOL
Ghosties: Oh you tease me sir.
the trololol guy died ;_;
Welsh_Pony: Tommorrow
Yea...that was pretty bad except for GOW:A and Last of Us
Ghosties: I thought that series was very definitely over?
Because of milking.
Gabe Newell comes out - "Three words; half life 3" - more applause than ALL of Sony
CONFERENCE WRAP UP CONFERENCE WRAP UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Once again it's up to Nintendo to save E3. God help us all.

Nittany_Discord: Last of Us kind of made that whole thing.
^
Reikim: YES
NO U
inb4 Gabe rolls in and announces RICOCHET TWOOOOOOOO!
so this is the last evet of e3?
Wii U is the worst thing to happen all E3.
04Sony was redeemed with The Last of Us
inb4 gabe newell comes out and shouts THREE!!! and gets out of stage
11,01Their Brawl clone hurt them a lot.
Nittany: Sony did pitifully. They advertised mostly games that weren't even theirs exclusively.
/me is bored by Sony
/me glomps Hodiku
Sony is better than Micro$oft because of Last of Us. <3
okay dat The Last of Us demo was pretty damn impressive
I need some hugs
SirGanjalf: inb4 Gabe rolls in and trolls us.
The Last of Us is Truely the LAST of good games PS has to offer
Nittany_Discord: Nothing new or spectacular, just kinda meh
haha
Nittany_Discord: All of it hurt except for that last game.
Nittany: The games that were actually theirs? THE WORST GARBAGE OF THE SHOW.
Conference wrap up! Conference wrap up!

Conference wrap up! Conference wrap up!

Holy Crap. ~
Rhubenstein!
Well, we need to hold everyone to equal standards. Sure, Half-Life 3 is going to be exciting. But we should expect innovation from Valve just as we expect innovation from everyone else.
CriticKitten: Because Sony kind of doesn't actually own that many good games.
meh at best
hm. That was ok, I guess. Nothing special. Ho Hum
yes CRAP
11,01So much bullshit being spouted now.
HAHAHAHA.. lier
11,01By the post-show.
This girl is not a gamer.
easily impressed lady is easily impressed
REMEMBER GUUYS FAT GUY ON SCREEN = HL3
That last game looked good, everything else...Meh
00,10payed anouncers are payed
last of us looks decent though, not spectacular, but decent enough
How much do I get when Orange Box 2 is announced?
A whole new level; and by new, I mean books...
11,02lol, they just start talking about the last game
cachi01: NO! YOU'VE JINXED IT!
stop reading the teleprompter and tell us what you really think!
I want to see Jeff Keighly interview Reggie again like last year XD
"I'm getting payed to say this"
REPORTERS ARE NOOBS.
I wonder how much they are being paid to be excted about this?
Kandarihu: i just hope the asshole fans stop bothering Gaben, recently 10k of them rioted...
LOL what about the other stuff ppl?
Did i missed Valve conference?
dead space 3 last of us and tomb raider all look good
huh, I assume that both conferences werent that good huh?
Reikim: Sort of the point, really. Their big spin is how successful they are, yet their only offered products are ASS. The best parts of their show were games that aren't theirs.
Reporters are always noobs.
I think their gunna change teh color, its gunan be the turquoise box or soemthing
payed anouncers are payed
SO INTESNE WOO
How many times did I grunt?
Zero.

Hmm. Trailers are meant to look good.
So so want this magic book game thing!

Kandarihu: except that Gaben is a nice guy and should be left in peace
^
Elephant god from Hinduism; looks like Kratos is still killing gods
Expensive DLC? Idgaf
NewDCD: You mean So Awesome~
The Last of Us looked, to me, like the only truly exciting game there. And it's on a console I refuse to own.
02didn't work
02:D
^
REPORTER IS BLATANT LIAR
NewDCD: But the real star of the show was the Magic Book of Spells
BOOK OF SPELLS WAS SHIT.
they're praising the fucking book
i dont like the reporter on the right
HOW MUCH THEY PAYING YOU TWO?
I feel like valve games or nothing more than the pure embodyness of wishing, hoping, and hype. They are theoretical entities that have no physical form
Still better than a 360
Screw it, only half past 3 AM
Good night people
twilight_sprinkle: certainly. What I meant is that Valve fanboys are becoming like Dethklok fanboys
Cool;I don't think that word means what you think it means
11,01I turned off stream.
I don't like dumb blondes.
THE LAST OF US LOOKED FUCK THERE ARE NO FUCKING WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW AWESOME I FEEL ABOUT THE LAST OF US

BACK TO PONIES.
HE SAID MY BODY IS READY
Nittany_Discord: Kinect needs to die.
Huh, a reporter used My Body is Ready Meme
11,01That too.
cachi01: You want to describe it? HELPFUL SUPPORTING CHARACTER. Done.
Did he just mispronounce ubisoft?
Nittany_Discord, it always was
HIS BODY IS READY
OH MY GOD
tbh, I really am looking foward to Dust514, its like...CoD'ish, set in the future, with upgradable hardsuits and weapons, but the real spot is that it is PS3 exclusive, but will communicate with EVE :)
IT'S REAL

If I can dream it I can make in in gmod already
Gaben is too awesome for E3

If I recall, someone made a Little Big Planet MLP game on there
THIS SONG... ANAMANAGUCHI?
00,10little big carte raceing
My brother would love this.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Yes, without the ponies, no game is valuable.
I can just about imagine it now. In the Metalocalypse universe, the crazy fans are actually in the minority, and there are far more ordinary sane fans who just enjoy the metal and do their best to make their world a LESS brutal place to live in.
sagas: Anamanaguchi. Also responsible for the eargasm that was the Scott Pilgrim game's soundtrack.
Spore 2?
TheRainbowDash: why are u so awesome?
SPORE 2?
:3
so in essence, it's like Mario Kart on a Playstation...
Kandarihu: What a weird concept.

Sumica: XDD DEM TAGS XDD
SunderlandPony89: nice Lol
See you all later everypony!
cachi01: But it was going to be all anatomycally accurate when they first announced Spore 1. It was going to be all sciency, but then they turned it into being all about cuteness.
a labyrinthine set of testicles
Weren't Ratchet and Clank on PC once?
02that's like
well, they're good at getting people to look for it
if so
that's why
/me wheezes in laughter
http://derpy.me/Zawzs
Cya ZappyTheUnicorn
So far this episode of the Buffering is truely Amazeballs! :)
because SONY wants the exclusives
Ninjazz|Challenge: I would hope
03Also
11,02OH GOD THOSE TAGS
03On the way home
bye ZappyTheUnicorn
its just a smidge like ssbb
They're not even trying to conceal it...
.
needs more Jak and Daxter too
03I saw this lady in her car smoking
BRB, gonna watch the new Jimqusition
03With two dogs in the back seat
you completely disregarded the video
wow
03Poor dogs ;.;
yeah
great
:c
10:<
02nope, Ratchet and Clank PS only
and :c that sucks
02is*
I love the dislike bar for that trailer.
03:P
10Animal abuse
00,10screnshots for great lols
stupid people be da*ned
So today, Sony was pathetic. But The Last of Us was AMAZEBALLS.
03yeah :/
10Burn her with fire
/) FillyFlam
drf you're missing the point lol
cachi01: I wanted and saved for that game for 2 years, the only game ive ever saved for that early before release. Then they went and fucked it up
That's their official channel
they ripped off smash bros
This presentation almost makes me want to throw away my PS3
and their tags
Pinkies4thWall: (\
ARE SMASH BROS
exactly?
big deal
But liek
IT IS STUPID
:V
00,10Sony must not be alowed to live it down
02that's like Nintendo not havn't Mario or Link in smash bros
Meanwhile: If you still have the stream in freeze frame, this is your amazeballs image.
02XD
it's just hte fact they even did that xD
lol sagas dont beleave eveyrthing MS says
02having*
:P ood-eldood-a-kcoc
Well it was semi-obvious
Sumica: TO THE FACEBOOKS
Looking at the trailer
03yeah OK, so Sony admits they're lame
03what else is new
no it was obvious
god damn its a strain on the eyes to read chat on IRC when you have your PC plugged into the TV and you're trying to read it from back on the couch
Reikim: I'm pretty sure the amazeballs were directed at something else. Possibly the book.
-_-
Sumica: it's basically SSB knockoff god knows how many years late?
630 likes, refresh, 661 dislikes XD
Sumica: You know the internet won't let this go. It is the internet after all.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Shush, spoilers.
Um drf
Sony and their wonderbooks too (AR 3DS go?)
:D
Well, I guess it's back to my S3 Bingo project....added 43-45 tonight, still have a ways to go yet
00,10exactly
usually they say they're amazing :p
and yeah the wonderbook rips off the AR system so much >>
Ugh... This E3...
Running out of ideas
that was a boring E3.
I LAUGH AT THE FAIL
cachi01: It wasnt Microsoft, It was Will Wright the maker of the Sims
00,10well yeah we all know it is Pinkies4thWall but the fact that they even say it on there own youtube.
Full of advertising and ripoffs
02drf, all the bashing on PS is getting old :U
And Sony doesn't even conceal it! Official video and the tags are "Super smash bros"! Sony, you are /pathetic/. Completely /shameless/.
Book of Magic is best pony
CupcakeWarrior: don't. If you don't want to play any more PS3 games, just make it a dedicated Folding@Home machine. Help cure diseases. But don't bother with Cancer, because that's about to be licked without protein folding.
I watched some of the MS E3 too
yeah, let's bash mircosoft instead
/me runs
Can you increase text size on mIRC? My eyes are killing me...
hey is there any good mlp games on the net
Amazeballz is best adjective.
And I really do think that the Halo 4 HUD looks Metroid primey :|
023>mircosoft
03I wasn't bashing anybody
03I said I didn't care
> Microsoft
cachi01: They sucked all the complexity and depth from it
thegt90: Check out Fighting is MAgic.
Amazeballs is actually a noun
http://www.tssznews.com/2012/06/04/the-tangent-microsoft-e3-2012-press-conference/
sports

03if you keep prodding me I WILL start bashing, only it'll be you guys instead
03kths
Damn.
03x
Amazeballs are best balls
Ninjazz|Challenge: You seemed to get over your shock of the new word quickly.
I'll get the terminal up then
Om: Time heals all wounds.
So this buffer is basically amazeballs.
03hah
03I see what you did there
Speaking of which, my throat still really hurts
023It’s Microsoft, what do you expect?
Surely I will make a effort to be at E3 2013 ......well unless the Mayan's are wrong *and will be wrong*
Ninjazz|Challenge: Almost :D
bash: DRF: No such file or directory
< You don't exist apparently
blueflare your text isgreen
:U
Athgaar: Better shove some amazeballz down it. :3
Ninjazz|Challenge: You're pronouncing it wrong. It's AMAZEBALLS!

ohai Scoot-Scootaloo

Well she did Came .....to this E3
And single handedly I am more liked than any announcer at E3.

Amazeballs was first used in 2009, therefore, old meme

02EW clients that don't support colour
00,03So yeah, what have we learned today?

HEY GUYS! I was announced!
And Scoot-Scootaloo has no idea what we're talking about

Scoot-Scootaloo: Amazeballz is actually a noun? :S
Scoot-Scootaloo: The Book of Spells is the most amazing game ever
wait pidgn does irc as well?
Scoot-Scootaloo: Appealing to the "casual" gamer isn't a good idea?
ffff it does everything doesn't it lol
no one loves Half-Life3
?
Scoot-Scootaloo: lots of control, screaming and hollering
Ninjazz|Challenge: Don't sound so supprised

Meanwhile: I don't know. Tobuscus man...
/me attacks Half-Life3 with hugs
Half-Life3: You dont exist
Half-Life3 <3
Scoot-Scootaloo: All of the best games for Sony's E3...weren't Sony games.
I prefer having seperate clients
except make coffee
Scoot-Scootaloo: That this year's E3 was bad
08,01i have Love's in Bloom stuck in my head
GilDash: That guy was a douche.

The name Scoot-Scootaloo sounds like what a rooster would say while crowing
*until*
Scoot-Scootaloo: Also, it is actually possible to have a badass little girl as a helpful AI partner. Our minds were blown.
Meanwhile: Nah, Aisha was a bitch.
We can't use Amazeballs, guys

02don't get me wrong, I like Sony. But that game is a bit much XD
02brb
sagas: NO! Worst idea!
SuperBrony64: Why do you own such a terrible game?
The numbers Mason.
Good thing I only rented this game at Red Box
I might actually watch the stream today, seeing i plugged the PC into the TV. I'm having to use the windows Magnifier tool to read chat :l
Why do you torture us SuperBrony64?
Hey, this is a random and strange question, but does anyone know if the Care-bears are being streamed on saturday?
SunderlandPony89: I just think it would be funny to watch! :D
Sadly I will never get my 2 dollares back from renting it :(
This scout rainbows make me cry! :P
*dollars*
EVIIIIIL
03after that, I don't give a crap anymore
03in the 80s, Sony was amazing
pony_8157: most unlikely
Well, I hate CoD on principle, for a number of reasons...not why I'm leaving, though. Night, everypony. Don't stop being AMAZEBALLS.

03you'd rather play old video games that were made in SD on a HDTV upscaled?
Ninjazz|Challenge: I wonder why. ;)
03it looks much better on a CRT
Anyone ever wonder how they managed to smuggle onboard this many fully decked-out terrorists onto the presidents plane?
02they're still using them, that's what's ew XD

RIP
My grandmother's 12ish year old CRT TV went bye bye a few months ago :<
Ninjazz|Challenge: I don't say much facts, what have I even told you about me at all hmm?
Ninjazz|Challenge: It is one of my tops of S2.
FlareChaser: Brohoof another brony, ofcourse.
Somepony please tell me this isn't MW3 . . .
It is
yet we had a plasma that died in 2 years
so
03ew 12 inch
can't tell a lie
alright...
and the CRT was on
/me noms FlareChaser
er
03I mean like the regular sized CRTs
Canadian_Brony: it is..
Canadian_Brony: Unfortunately, SB64 decided to troll us
02drf, hence setting the right resolution
"I repeat: shots fired" YOU DONT SAY?
03like 25-29"
not 12inch
DRF READ
:P
Ninjazz|Challenge: What would you do if you saw me IRL? ;)
03we had a 27" trinitron
Om: Other than you like Fluttershy as well, nothing much.
12ish  years
:P
03oh, right
CupcakeWarrior: D:
03BlueFlare, you're missing the point
She had a 27inch I think
Everlasting_Joy: It is one of mine as well. :)
03old consoles were analog, they didn't use pixels
03HDTVs make them pixelsated
03-s
GilDash: I'd hug you and give you a brohoof :3
but it was on 24/7
GilDash: Not... going to asnwer that. :$
Yo dawg I heard you like CoD. So I put shit in this shit to make you gag while you gag.
Ninjazz|Challenge: Exactly.
Hmmm..... not much difference between this and the Xbox version ....except better aim *results may very*
|Discord|: Hahaha. . .!
Darg14 FlareChaser SunderlandPony89 I guess Scoot-Scootaloo was right when he said we couldn't have nice things . . .
Save the 4th girl to appear in a CoD game!
CRT + Coax/cable = Good picture for consoles
FlareChaser: Aww, that's nice. Look Ninjazz|Challenge, somepony cares. :)
/me hugs |Discord| back
CRT + AV = A bit better
GilDash: If I saw you in real life, I would offer you tea/
Canadian_Brony: we can never have nice things..
Canadian_Brony: This whole series is why we can't have nice things
03EW COAX
LCD/Plasma + Coax = Crap crap
03CRT + RCXA
03-X
I blame...uh..who to blame..
GilDash: >.<
So everyone gets to ask me one question and I will answer truthfully about anything as long as it doesnt compromise my anonymity. You only get one question. Shoot
I blame SuperBrony64
03and well
RCA ftw
CoD is sexiest. Only 4 gurls. THA BUCK!
03coax itself is just a carrier
yeah
02still drf, it's better then playing on a CRT that takes up a bunch of space
FlareChaser: But I wanted to be blamed D:
CREDITS ROLL
Slim CRTs?
:P
ded
yay physics
03I watch 720p using coax
GilDash: HEY! Are you saying I don't care?! D:
So much boom
And this landed in the swamps and gave birth to the scene in L4D2
Om: If I saw you IRL I would drink it. :)
lol
Seems survivable... NOT
Yeah right
03coax cables just carry whatever signal through it
02they're still huge HML
|Discord|: But Infinity Ward doesn't wanna put women in the line of fire!
03but in terms of consoles
03BlueFlare, I'm huge, are you saying I should go replace myself with a slimmer model?
Ninjazz|Challenge: I don't know. Not answering somepony is very rude, Jazzstars.
/me runs
GilDash: How senseible.
dat accent
02LOL
GilDash: wait...what are you?
sagas: What's your favorite brony site?
sagas: Favorite pony?
Om: I was thinking how Churchill of me, but whatever. :D
GilDash: I'd hug you, okay?...
no no no no NO!!! You DIED!! Physics say you were sucked out of that plane. You would be rolling around unconcious and dying. Basically, you are dead. DEE EE DEE DEAD!!!
GilDash: a girl or a guy..
Ninjazz|Challenge: I'll keep that in mind. ;)
Big_Macintosh_1992: reddit.com/r/mylittlepony
FlareChaser: That would be telling. ;)
GilDash: Just bring a momocle, and all will be fine.
Inb4 the president is dead.
LOL
Om: I'll go to my tailor.
Or not.
But
02then why do wii and NGC games look fine on a HDTV when you set the right resolution?
Meanwhile: Close enough
GilDash: not sure if flirting or making fun of me..
02they're SD
Indeed.
03because those are digital?
or just not telling..
Meanwhile: Its like the sixth sense. He was dead all along
GilDash: You do that :D
inb4 an army of evil Russians pour out of the woods from nowhere
Toasty fire.
Om don't forget the top hat ^^
03GameCube is often 480p
GilDash: Well, that depends on if we meet in IRL.
sagas: That explains everything.
I'm just gonna say you're a guy.
03but people are stupid and use the crappy interlaced cables
The only problem with regular 1 pin cable/coax is that you gotta be careful with how you plug it in .v.
inb4 heli goes boom
Well
Exploding TREE!!!! S*** just got real!!!
It's 11pm EST/10pm CST/8pm PST. On the west coast, Regular Show is showing now.
Invi: Some people just don't look good in hats hmm?
HDTVs in 2003?
02I've hooked my N64 and SNES on my HDTV and they both look fine though
Not very popular
uh
FlareChaser: All of the above? ;)
FlareChaser: He is.
sagas: thanks! I'm about 2 weeks into brony fandom online so I'm looking for good places to be
N64 is crap on HDTV
/me hugs kirzstryfe
I'll admit it
so awesome!!! thanks for cool site saga
SNES looks file
Regular show...pffffftt
GC looks decent
Out. Of. Bloody. Nowhere.
Wii is okay
but yeah, bad N64
lol
03you're sitll upscaling the crap out of it
Om yeah but a top hat with a monocle goes always along for more sir-y-ness
Or did the plane just so happen to land in an evil Russian base?
Big_Macintosh_1992: Well I mainly use that site and EQ Daily, alongside chatting on this site
Invi: Ture.
Meanwhile: ...so what would you do if we met IRL? I'd probably just brohoof you and walk away ._.
/me explodes
Oh acog sight
02it's still better then having a CRT hooked up :U
Invi: I think you mean to say, dear fellow, that it lends one a sense of refinement and quality.
bloack ops 2?
sagas: i love this site, people are great here.
I have good news. Strawberry shortcake has been moved to an almost unwatchable timeslot. It's now at 7:00 am EST/ 4:00 am PST.

GilDash: I never said I didn't want a fight eh?
02true, but you get my point
Bobeh: So you actually LIKED everything there?
SuperBrony64: The fact that they sold out when MW2 was released
Sure looks like a COD game
Ninjazz|Challenge still doing that challange?
Om: I'm a lover, not a fighter. ;)

Everlasting_Joy else they will shoot you....
StupidSexyCJ yes
03as for which one is correct, I think they're the same levels, just rendered differently
CupcakeWarrior: The offer's open to everypony. ;)
GilDash: I'm afraid if all is fair in love and war, those two are one in the same. Or can be hmm?
03it's similar to Brawl
enemy gets shot, dies, you gte shot, bearly injured
Quadrenaro: cool, looks good
Dken2021: Eyup! I'm on S2 E9. Sweet and Elite.
03in 4:3, you can walk off the edge a bit and not die

Invi, dogs shooting us. I knew they'd put some sort of harness on them.
03no
Meanwhile: That's the main reason why I hate it. Those fucks need to just stop proving how idoitic people can be
Only 1 mod is active?
too late!
03the wii itself defaults to 4;3
...post ponies.
03you have to go change it to 16:9

That's my third rage comic.
Everlasting_Joy it's evolution. they will take over somewhen
03as far as i know, Brawl is the only Wii game that lets you change the system's ratio from inside the game
CupcakeWarrior: Since 24 hrs ago, I kinda took too many breaks on the account of chat and E3.
03all the rest you have to go to system settings
Invi, well, better dogs then apes in my opinion.
Meanwhile: Sadly, you have a point
GilDash: Yet it does. How quaint eh?
SB, do somethin silly
/me /) GilDash <3
Meanwhile: whenever someone talks to you, it looks like they're just saying "meanwhile, this happened"
Om: Not quite... :S
The Wii U was easily the best thing at E3
Meanwhile, in russia.

Big_Macintosh_1992: great isn't it.
DuskStarshimmer: (\
Meanwhile: its pretty great
Meanwhile: While that is true, a lot of people still make common sense, but they're slowly losing sanity.
GilDash: Not everyone loves and does not war, as you do. Best to remeber that spat you had earlyer today
Walk it off Price
FlareChaser: I know exactly what you frogspawn.

Canadian_Brony: See ya! :)
02why would it look better? Unless you have no idea how to set the right resolution
wait, crap! sorry GilDash I read that wrong! I'm not leaving!
