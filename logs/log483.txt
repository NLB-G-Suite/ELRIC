IS*
2You can do eet :D
03Nick, and this is why I don't buy games anymore
03it's that simple
can't wait for Halo 4
yeah
But Ubisoft is on right now
It's one minute to 8/7c/5p.
LOL
ubi already ended
oh gawd
I want to give it to my parents as a parting gift of sorts
Its still on Ubisoft
Ubisoft needs moar social networking
It's 8/7c now. Regular Show is showing on Cartoon Network.
Hello!
which is why I never play online on my 360 anymore
03LOL
03well
/me sings the theme song to Regular Show.
03at least with Xbox Live, you're paying for *actual quality service*
03LOL PSN
MBBWOOOOOOOOOWM
mfw people like regular show
03Granted, some games are just a bunch of 12-year olds cussing each other out
03others are just a bunch of 20-year olds cussing each other out
03it's all in waht games you choose to play :P
and yeah that too
03I signed up for PSN and then it got hacked
which is why I've changed my gaming focus to quality single player games
03but how long it took them to get it back online
03was just hilarious
yeah
^
03*again
For those in europe, It's 2am/1am UK now.
lol
03so as much as people whine about paying for Xbox Live, consider the fact that it *actually works*
SSBB online
xD
tooncast?
or top top toons?
XD
lol
03still
lol
Here in the phillipines, Oggy and the Cockroaches is practicaly on Cartoon Network "all day everyday".
03luckily I don't play games that involve screaming people over mics
03like, people say Xbox 360 and everybody assumes COD and Halo, I won't touch either series with a 10 foot pole :P
03Minecraft on the other hand
yeah, I was in with a great crowd when I played l4d online
/me hides
03I used to play L4D2 a lot
OH FLAPJACK XD
^
Dat air launch
DONT GO TO BREAD
Flapjack was.......I dunno
I played both tonnes loved the freaking thing
wha? you guys were watching ponies?
Chowder was the last good show on CN
flapjack was flapjack
Chowder was ok
chowder was AMAZING
it was simple, you just needed to play as a good team no unlocking the next weapon/class/w/e
It had its good moments
03er wait
03unlocking in L4D?
03o.,o
03-,
I disliked Total Drama Island
I felt like killing myself the first time I saw Flapjack
total drama island was ok
well I'm just dropping by
no I didn't say that I said there was none of that
Total Drama Island was meh
i liked flapjack
I didn't care for Chowder. I thought it was utterly stupid.
>bronystate is streaming tf2 gameplay
for a canadian cartoon, TDI was ok
you just needed to use teamwork and valve /really/ forced that which was a good thing
l4d 1 & 2
Chowder did have its really good moments though :P
03er
03oh
03I see
I just had a whole pizza. That should give me enough carbs to watch the PS show.
03I was misreading that
pony sprays everywhere
ok
i want that rarity one
If you do that the terrorists win.
and my instructor is back, brb
03at least that's how I am
00,10how do you break it by using it?
EE&E
Yeah I did overplay it
you can
E3
then instead of teleporting you explode the exit
Watch Dogs does not interest me
hello evry pony
hey
ok it had 3 dlc packs but that was over both games I really did expect more from valve
and crysis
00,10sapper tech
00,10they have improved it
All those teleporters and sentries
:<
All those machines!
the lifespan of that thing increased dramatically though when it was f2p then introduced the hats
Erect ALL the dispensers!
(\ For Jawbreakers!
have you fixed it yet?
ya
and it got lots of maps on top of infinite mods
03why do people even care about hats
enough time to rewatch Korra twice
yeah
but it made valve a crap tonne of dough
03it's like people obsessing over avatar items on the Xbox
03it's silly
03oh I'm sure
Erect ALL the dispensers!
Watch_Dogs intrigued me.
but honestly paying real money for virutal items?
Hehe, erect
watch dogs gave me a nerdgasm
03I've done it a few times for XBL but very rarely
Watch Dogs looks like it could be genuinely intersting.
2We pay money for games :P
03most of those avatar items I don't bother with
2Essentially virtual things
/me runs
2Excluding you then, lol
03nah, I do sometimes
03well
They're putting Friends on Nick at nite! :D
03discs get scratched and damaged
03you buy the DVD
its just the feeling that they're paying real money for something that really, doesn't exist, it's virtual
2Aye
03which is why >paying money
i dont like friends
03you see where I'm coming from?
/me hides
What's the name of this map? I forgot but I have played it before.
I feel their should be a cartoon throwback to about 8 years ago
like EA's
03which is why >piracy
03Then you can play it all you want
03and not bother with the stupid DRM
03exactly.
doesn't stop it
03it's why I don't buy games for the most part
03I buy all of the Humble Indie Bundles because those make a point of being DRM-free
03It's like movie trailers, it could be complete garbage for all you know
2Because I know myself pretty well
03yeah but I mean preordering games
03how do you know it's any good :P
03if it's not even out
03>Diablo 3
2I've waited for that for 10 years :P
Lola is the one that makes all blondes look stupid.
/me explodes
ZAMBAMBOES
03and it sucked
i buy games, but don't play them
03what of it :P
I want to kick her sometimes.
Still Lola was hilarious only because the rest of the looney tunes were toned down and boring.
03<junh1024-XD> i buy games, but don't play them <- same really, which is why I stopped buying games
03I've played all of... 2?
the looney tunes show is awesome
/me never liked Looney Tunes
Okay guys, just came in to say hi

08,01it's probably bigger than you can possibly imagine
at this moment I can understand :\
08,01inb4 he kicks me just to prove me wrong :P
/me has watched all the spongebob episodes
03At least I actively do something about that >_>
2That burglar alarm
and also the fairy godparents before the poof saga

Saturn: Hes a bit preoccupied
sooo

That's like hating toast
On the episode where Spongebob stole his Driver's License.The card said 25,so his 25 :)

Those were pretty good quality :P
Derpy is watching you watch ponies
03BlueFlare you do realize they didnj't have LCD/plasma before the 2000s?
03I said the 80s
03what else would they use
*here
03rear projection is awful
I want to blow that pic up to a size that fits an entire section of cieling ;)
03now front projection is alright but that's quite literally just using a projector+screen

My grandmother's 12ish year old CRT TV went bye bye a few months ago :<
It is
03ew 12 inch
can't tell a lie
alright...
and the CRT was on
er
03I mean like the regular sized CRTs
02drf, hence setting the right resolution
"I repeat: shots fired" YOU DONT SAY?
03like 25-29"
not 12inch
DRF READ
:P
03we had a 27" trinitron
12ish  years
:P
03oh, right
03BlueFlare, you're missing the point
She had a 27inch I think
03HDTVs make them pixelsated
03-s
but it was on 24/7
CRT + Coax/cable = Good picture for consoles
03EW COAX
LCD/Plasma + Coax = Crap crap
03CRT + RCXA
03-X
I blame...uh..who to blame..
03and well
RCA ftw
03coax itself is just a carrier
yeah
CREDITS ROLL
Slim CRTs?
:P
ded
03I watch 720p using coax
And this landed in the swamps and gave birth to the scene in L4D2
lol
Seems survivable... NOT
Yeah right
03coax cables just carry whatever signal through it
03but in terms of consoles
03BlueFlare, I'm huge, are you saying I should go replace myself with a slimmer model?
/me runs
dat accent
02LOL
LOL
Or not.
But
02then why do wii and NGC games look fine on a HDTV when you set the right resolution?
02they're SD
or just not telling..
inb4 an army of evil Russians pour out of the woods from nowhere
03GameCube is often 480p
03but people are stupid and use the crappy interlaced cables
inb4 heli goes boom
Well
It's 11pm EST/10pm CST/8pm PST. On the west coast, Regular Show is showing now.
HDTVs in 2003?
02I've hooked my N64 and SNES on my HDTV and they both look fine though
Not very popular
uh
N64 is crap on HDTV
I'll admit it
SNES looks file
Regular show...pffffftt
GC looks decent
Wii is okay
but yeah, bad N64
lol
03you're sitll upscaling the crap out of it
/me explodes
Oh acog sight
bloack ops 2?
03not really.

Why must we always shoot the doggies?! I hate that!
YES
02oh
02derp
03it has both modes
Lol
03as for which one is correct, I think they're the same levels, just rendered differently
03it's similar to Brawl
03in 4:3, you can walk off the edge a bit and not die
02But by default on the wii it’s 16;9
thx
03bu6t in widescreen, nop7e :P
03no
Only 1 mod is active?
03the wii itself defaults to 4;3
...post ponies.
03you have to go change it to 16:9
02I did
