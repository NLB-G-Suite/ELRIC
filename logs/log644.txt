why's the therainbowvortex
that* <_<
I see. Yoiu like doing this with the Heavy
00,02this map is silly
00,02Kandarihu, but of course
meeny resions my little dashie/ cupcakes/ rainbow factorie and meny more
00,02why would you surf with any other class
13i thought pyro was the class to surf with because airblasts
so now im totaly dead inside
00,02ok, so need to surf OVER those
00,02that requires crazy speed
try scout/pyro?
i have no hapienes left
00,02i surf heavy because screw physics i'ma flying heavy
00,02therainbowvortex, you should watch mlp
00,02its been known to cause happy
i do watch mlp
srsly?
00,02clearly you dont watch enough
almost
no i just read too much my little dashie and grim darks
inb4 phase4 dies again
00,02SafariMonkey, is not big surprise
Does anypony have an idea of somthing I could draw?
00,02this map is a smidge buggy
Phase4: Is joke. You're doing better than I probably would
00,02the first turn is a little too far to the right
00,02plus i sware the initial shove is going the wrong way
00,02SafariMonkey, yeah, i've gotten fairly good at this :P
00,02i blame the map
00,02clearly its faulty
ouch
oky-doky-loky...
00,02: D
00,02but now i have to find where to go after that
gl :p
Phase4: I guess the skiing physics aren't like tribes, or it'd be impossible.
00,02ah, is s bend
00,02SafariMonkey, its probably unrelated
Phase4: You can change direction midair? Art major physics much?
00,02tf2 surfing originated in coutner strike
00,02XD
00,02yeah, change dir mid air

This won't end good.
Aircrafter: what are they big fans of

flutterchu: Cars, being a man, video games.....
Aircrafter: what video games?
i like all man things and ponies
Well only one of them likes video games...
if its part of you then its part of you
My bad, Its difficult to describe them.
Aircrafter: do they know minecraft?

flutterchu: They don't know the internet or anything involved.
well Aircrafter its not like youre coming out of the closet
then dont openly say it to their face just dont be afraid to have somone ealk in on you watching it
SUPA!!!! SMASH Bros. Meeleeeeeeeee!!!

Aircrafter: i predict it wont budge
Aircrafter: how old are they?
flutterchu: All adults 20-30
dont gotta be in their face and besides i think telling them is more of a step for yourself than just telling someone else
how old are you Aircrafter (you dont have to tell me)
flutterchu: 10 years younger than the youngest of the other 3. So...Kinda young.

Thanks Everypony. I hope when you all die its quick and painless :3

Neurotoxicins
cowboys and anthrax
Does anyone here speak italian? Wrek? AdamTheDuck_?
at least this game doesn't try to hide the fact that the player is an addicted maze rat
TheRandomkid321, enope
gah
Petzode murdre.
#Dashiesauce ..
oh no Phase4!
lol, dat victory incandescence
00,02lolfail
ouch
00,02i remember this being easier
I take it this is Portal 1?
yes
http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/697322_o.gif im predicting what my little dashie would be like http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs/697322_o.gif
When does the beta for Guns of Icarus end?
(shit i sent that link twice)
I got 6000 MS points and with that I bought BF3 premium, Trials Evolution, and Scott Pilgrim v.s The World.
Flutterchu do you speak italian.
TheRandomkid321: um.......no ;_;
BF3 premium. and with that, you just lost all your honor
oh that Halfe life ref
Dark_Horst Too late.
hi everyone :)
flutterchu Oh okay... petzo de murdre...
TheRandomkid321: i can only read japanese
oh Phase4 is Portaling :)
Dark_Horst, /) so glad I'm not the only one that realise's EA's horrid marketing practices
realises*
00,02i always go in there and forget where i'm suposed to go
AdamTheDuck yes but I felt SO dicriminated against without it.
*discriminated
Like TF2 F2Pers.
TheRandomkid321, that was why I stopped playing Battlefield 3 entirely.
/me is watching Dead Space Aftermath
I like that in Portal 2, the orange text on the monitors is actually the cake recept, I dunno about Portal 1 though
AdamTheDuck I did taht for several months but I just decided to buck it all.
Worth the money I must say.
Because you won't have the full experience unless you pay that little bit extra even though you put your full trust in it on your $80 pre order.
AdamTheDuck I agree entirely
Phase4: portal on top of other portal
I think EA is trying to be the WalMart of video games.
Gameplay wise it is a fun team based game. Worth my dosh? In my opinion: no.
But EA got through the force of my mind... ANyway... I missed doing a 360 jump out of a chopper, blowing up a tank, and taking out a jet in 60 seconds flat.
Buying out everybody they can to make the biggest buck.
EA's just a giant money grubber is all.
Gold_Demona: nah wal mart at least has items for reasonable prices
Anyway everyones entitled to their own opinion.
RoboGerbil: Yeah, but the quality of said items sucks bawls compared to other stores.
And my friend gave me a HD xbox cable so I haz clear graphics ^_^
It's not the game I hate, it's the feeling of betrayal from EA that stops me.
The shadows.... SO smooth...
RoboGerbil: Also, WalMart cuts a hell of a lot of corners in its inner workings so their big wigs keep more money in their pockets.
Oh well, enough rambling, back to homework I go...
The cake is a lie Phase4 THE CAKE IS A LIE!
AdamTheDuck at 8:30?
that there computer cut the cake :(
00,02i forget the way here
I'm the type of guy that leaves all the work to the night before. :P
At least Walmart doesn't sell you 23/24 cans of soda in a box for full price and chage extra for the 24th.
AdamTheDuck I did it friday arvo ^_^
RoboGerbil: Which in some places results in product not worth the cheaper price.
This game makes me feel sick :(
BuyToast: This is true, but they took out their butchers and seafood sections so you're forced to get pre-delivered meat that's nowhere near as fresh.
What if Chell is talking. She just has suck a high pitched voice only dogs can hear her?
Hi guys
Hi XylemTube
anypony want to play some left 4 dead 2? im starting one up
it had ponies in it
BuyToast: Also, they treat their employees like shit, which results in unhappy employees, which results in shitty customer service.
lol Gold_Demona still ranting
My husband used to work for WalMart. They are NOT a good company
Gold_Demona: how so?
I was about to apply for a job there
Well im off to bed everypony see yall in the morning ok.......peace
Night Moopy
later
bye Moopy
XylemTube: The pay is shit for the work you do. Also the benefits aren't that great. It's literally impossible to make a living in this company.
Gold_Demona: I'm just looking for a part-time job
XylemTube: For a younger person who's just looking to earn a little spending money, I don't think there's much of an issue, but I do NOT recommend it as a long-term career.
ah
cool then
My brother in law worked for them for fifteen years and still wasn't making enough to make a good living.
I care! I want cake! D:
Time to learn the mechanic of the rocket launcher. This is important. =P
lol Bring the cube with you, why not
clang clang clang
lol i keep pressing the keys on my keaboard like i'm actually playing the game.
now I want to play this
This chat is dedder than I've seen in ages. .3
I think it's usually like this on Sundays
Ded as ded can be
I haven't been here enough Sundays to say for certain, but I think I'm correct. :P
3 hours until I go into bad mood Monday mode :|
00,02anyone know how to do that bug
Phase4: What bug?
What bug, Phase4?

00,02you can get to the cake room i think
Oh, THAT bug
Nope :P

Hello GreeTheGermanBrony
Hi GreeTheGermanBrony

Only Austrailian band I really know is Air Supply. :P
00,02ah nvm

And of course, similar to laste sunday night, my brain suddenly is bursting with thought leading me to ponder our existance.
le science
watching this makes me want to do this myself.
Just try to not get yourself depressed again TheRandomkid321, it's unhealthy. :P
Buytoast
Yes?
AdamTheDuck that is not the easiest task for one to ponder our existance, the very purpose of our whole lives, is a rather depressing act.
thats a nice name you have there
00,02pony65361, you can change your nick with /nick
Like /nick [name]
thanks..
because jumping whwn walking long distances in a video game really makes you go faster
I would write out the welcome song to you Miriu132 but I'm busy. :P

00,02AdamTheDuck, not yet
00,02havent really played
00,02might try that
What about Kerbals?
Game gets kind of boring, but the story keeps you going.
DAMN!!!! brb, I need to go on Kickstarter, I wanted to pledge for something but I forgot, I hope I still have time!
Yes, I actually play games for the plot :P , surprising in this day and age...
00,02the progress bar was a button
Sho CrazyCherry the pony is a colt,right

Hell, what am I doing pondering our existance on this earth when we are yet to explore 95% of it...
Princess_Cadence: Mare.
Ohh
My bad.
00,02AdamTheDuck, story is all well and good but i really cant stand bad gameplay even if the story is good
our Laboratory once had a Plotter... but just was the name of the Machine XD
nice... the sites won't load -.-
Phase4 I take it you, like me ate God Of War?
*hate
00,02never played it
Phase4, oh you'll eventually find more weapons that fit to your liking, hammer and bow is boring at first :/
00,02AdamTheDuck, i wasnt saying bastion's gameplay was bad :P
Phase4 well me neither but from what I have seen it's blood and sex with an EXTREMELY thin coating they dare call a story.
Oh right, gameplay in general :D my bad
. ..why doeesn't any website load again?
dat tree wood
0_0
Bastion was one of the best games of 2011.
Its story, man.
Phase4: im going to debate to a chair
00,02so the ksp update is broken
00,02also 'neighbours' is a tv series that has been running far to long
This guy's hilarious. XXD
Why is my stream not working?
00,02suddenly russian
00,02more tf2 i gues
DO people really click those ads? Are they really of such low intellect they are fooled by it?
Echoooooo.
TheRandomkid321, I wonder the same thing...
Echoooo.
Echooo.
Echo.
00,02wonder where Wrek is
Phase4: d

That's one thing I miss about the flash chat that the chat client doesn't have. The image emotes.
So bye everyone
Me too -_-
Gold_Demona, so much.
Bye,donut!
awh
bbye
ponies
I miss seeing Rarity instead of just a ;)
;)
true freindship
Unfortunately, it's outweighed by the convenience of the client. :P
.
Dot
So, no emotes for us, right Ninjazz?
Ohhh
Gold_Demona, unfortunately. :(
I like sheep.
they should have an emototcon for this /)
.3.
Well
o.o
flutterchu: and this (\
Gold_Demona, unless you're using xChat (HexChat). I think there is am od where you can put the emotes in for that client.
Dem sheep
mod*
Gold_Demona: i have my own emotocon
<-------------
Ninjazz: I have XChat Azure.
Gold_Demona, so there is potential for you to get those emotes back. ^_^

mentallyeffedguy: yes but someone here a while ago told me to stop putting that message at the end
Yay for Wrek :>

flutterchu: why u shake?
Hi alexxm
mentallyeffedguy: when im alone in the dark by myself
Gold_Demona: so how was the trip to your mom?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas because it takes the shakes away! flutterchu
how are things GoldDemona
on the computer hoping there wont be a screamer
MadSurge: It was good. We hung out. Watched some movies. Ate some BBQ wings. Good times. =)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEOSLHZwKwM
MadSurge: Showed my uncle my progress on the sweater I'm crocheting for him. He's impressed every single time. :P
Gold_Demona: wish I could watch movies with my mom :D my dad is more on my kind of movies though
Just like that I rick rolled everyone in chat that has clicked the link
MadSurge: I'm fortunate that my mom and sister have mostly the same taste in movies as me.
MadSurge: So we all usually agree as far as our opinions on movies.
00,02http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/ << worth a read
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDOtEeI8sOQ
00,02must find a non php-based wordpress alternative
Oooh, younger sister Gold_Demona?
MadSurge: Yep, younger. Only by two years though.
http://youtu.be/2AVrvDqogCo
Gold_Demona: My bro is 9 years younger, and he's almost my perfect opposite :D we still go along well
so still no word on season 3 yet?
Nooope
One of these days
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
MadSurge: My sister's almost a bigger otaku than me, but that's mostly because she has easier access to anime than me. XD
Gold_Demona: :D
easier access?
Wirisme: Yeah, I have Netflix. She has Netflix and cable. :P
Ah I see :)
nemnemnemnem
And she frequents DVD stores
I rarely leave my house
Gold_Demona: I am very open to any cartoon, so it's not just anime to me :D
*for
Now we play the buffer game :3
MadSurge: Me too. I love cartoons in general. =)
yay I love the buffer game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaVwhG5ygss this always makes me cry it makes me think of my childhood and it......it's just burnt out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaVwhG5ygss
flutterchu: in a good way?
flutterchu: yeah, I have three or four different versions of that song in my music collection.
Hey Phase4, when does the beta for Guns of Icarus end?
Gold_Demona: my mom is still on the "grow up" side of the matter, my dad is more like "just don't obsess over cartoons" :D
00,02AdamTheDuck, dont know
00,02brb
MadSurge: when you watch anima or mlp?
Gold_Demona: he clearly saw how "kiddy" the Powerpuff Girls was :D
MadSurge: Yeah, my uncle's that sort. He thinks anime is gay and refuses to give any of it a chance. =/
mentallyeffedguy: more like with cartoons or games in general
MadSurge: He also doesn't like most cartoons.
Gold_Demona: most? what does he like?
Gold_Demona: anime is always a shitload of talking and a tiny bit of fighting :P
MadSurge: He loves Futurama
Gold_Demona: ah, at least it's a good one
mantallyeffedguy: If it's a fighting anime, sure. :P
five days til next movie night :(
MadSurge: Yeah, it just drives me nuts how narrow his view of entertainment is. =/
Gold_Demona: at least it's not Family Guy, which I loathe :D
;U; *tears of joy*
mentallyeffedguy: Unless it's Dragonball Z, then it's mostly "AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!" and a tiny bit of fighting. XD
haha yeah
so is south park actually doing a brony episode
MadSurge: We unanimously hate Family Guy
Gold_Demona: never seen that show
alexxm: oh god no
Oh God a brony episode of South Park?
Gold_Demona: THE COMIC WAS MORE ACTION PACKED :D
i like family guy :P
My grandfather couldn't get over the amount of screaming in dbz when we used to watch it
alexxm: there just gonna treat it like pokemon
Wirisme: thats really funny!
It was :D
alexxm: it's too girly kartman says kyle likes it he blahblahblah
lol
I'm fortunate that my mom's more open minded and will actually give my stuff a shot before laying judgement on it. :P
flutterchu it's south park everything gets the piss taken on it
Gold_Demona: good for you! :)
She's not overly into anime either, but she at least gives it a try. As a result she's found a handful of things she likes. Like Studio Ghibli. She LOVES Ghibli movies.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgAqoXT-2kM&feature=related good dropsies
Gold_Demona i know a movie the guy who made studio ghlibi did before he really got famous thats good
Gold_Demona: ah, only saw Totoro and Howl
another song also makes me cry but pikachu's goodbye is better than this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAwxe8JxqqM
I don't watch anime, it's not really very easy to find here from what I've experienced
alexxm: I know a handful of movies and a couple of anime series Miyazaki did before he made Ghibli.
There isn't even any on TV a whole lot
Gold_Demona you ever seen castle of caglisto
MadSurge: Howl is my favorite, but all of Ghibli's movies are awesome. :3
alexxm: You're talking to a Lupin fanatic. Of course I've seen Cagliostro. :3
alexxm: Two different dubs of it in fact
old anime why are you so awsome?
alexxm: plus Japanese and Italian
its over 8000!
ah right Gold_Demona i'm trying to get caglisto as a movie for the movie night would you say it falls under a or b by the sites definations
alexxm: I've been putting it under b when I enter.
does anyone remember this from the 90's http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQsQqOlPjhs
alexxm: I don't really know for certain where it falls under, but to be safe I put it as B
Gold_Demona: for some reason here Lupin is considered a kid's cartoon :D
Gold_Demona yeah thats what i was putting it under as well
Sorry flutterchu
Gold_Demona: I still love it of course
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p6AOe5qmJQ&feature=relmfu because fluttershy
MadSurge: Lupin's my favorite anime of all time.

HIYA everypony
Hiyo Bronysith
Hello Bronysith
Hi Bronysith
Gold_Demona those are the only lupin stuff i can find in england
how are things Bronysith
MadSurge: Yes he is. My favorite is Jigen though. Huge toon crush on Jigen. :3
Gold_Demona: of course, he's the best gunner in the world!
Gold_Demona: also his cigarette will never end :D
lol nope
and he can blow up a plane with a single bullet Gold_Demona
http://fav.me/d10wlmk
Old art is old, but Tada~
nice
Gold_Demona: that's pretty great :D
I traced the car, but the rest I actually drew. :P
Also... http://fav.me/d2xyszv
Gold_Demona: for some stupid reason Goemon in the italian dub is pronounced Geh-mon
MadSurge: I know, it made me laugh so hard when I first heard it. XD
Gold_Demona: :O you know? Did you watch a bunch of dubs?
MadSurge: I've seen a lot of the Italian dubbed stuff.
Gold_Demona: :O any reason?
im watching the old pokemon right now *tears of joy*
MadSurge: Mostly I love the Italian language, and I can actually half-understand it. :P
flutterchu: good for you! :)
That's cool
MadSurge: It's very similar to Spanish.
Gold_Demona: that's great! and yes it is
Gold_Demona i hear lupins really popular in italy
Gold_Demona: and I like the dub, actually, the voices are all pretty spot on
alexxm: It is! Italy has had the series since the very beginning! I'm so jealous!
MadSurge: I agree. Especially Lupin. His voice was perfect.
Gold_Demona do they have that new series that was made last year?
alexxm: I don't know. I haven't looked into it yet.
alexxm: I know they have as far as Green vs. Red. But I don't know beyond that
Gold_Demona: same for Yattaman, for some reason. Italy had a great boom of japanese cartoons in the sixties/seventies/eighties.
Dat Setup Gold_Demona o.o
Jmo: huh?
Mac and windows side-by-side.
Jmo: lol Yep. I'm an equal opportunity computer-user. ^^
i think i
need to
play some
Gold_Demona: also I see you like Gargoyles :D
final fantasy 8
MadSurge: LOL, Is it so obvious? *points to username*
OBJECTION
"BGM begins to play"
/me bangs table
the one who murdered him was
/me points to MadSurge "YOU"
Gold_Demona: you should try the Gargoyle Quest and Demon Crest games then :D
Bronysith: :| *you lose an exclamation point*
MadSurge: NO "bangs table"
you have no alibi
no witnesses
YOU ARE THE MURDERER
00,02Gold_Demona, i'd use osx as well as windows and linux if it was possible to use it on non mac hardware
00,02which sure its possible but you try it
lol
Phase4: I don't think I have any hope to learn my way around Linux, so I'm kinda stuck with Mac and Windows. :P
im already on episode 78 and pikachu is changing :'(
00,02Gold_Demona, its not that hard
what do you mean pikachu is changing i forgot what episode 78 was flutterchu
00,02^
god I haven't watched that show in so long
I used to love that show, but I think Ash's journey should've stopped in Kanto
Think that's when I stopped watching
Idk I can't remember it that well
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewmqwQWBBMg o.o
I stopped watching some time after he got to Hoenn.
Taking Misty out of the cast killed the series for me
If you're gonna take out main characters, take out frickin' Ash!
...
Ok, show of hands. Who agrees that Red and Ash are two completely separate characters?
THAT BASTARD
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HOW COULD HE
I *accept* that they are
he just got himself a Still in Shrink wrap copy of legend of dragoon
Bronysith: He who?
Gold_Demona: my friend
hello
Bronysith: ah
Hello Applejack`
Hiyo Applejack`
Hai AppleDash
00,02Gold_Demona, Red != Ash
Applejack`

Ff
00,02i've seen enough of the manga to tell that
Hello Applejack
Phase4: You mean Red ? Ash?
00,02i assume you meen the manga and not the games
Phase4 I've never read the manga, so I don't know what Red is like in the manga
good, Jmo
00,02not sure which red your talking about
ou
good, alexxm *
00,02ohai applejack`
Phase4: I just know about how Red is in the games
I assumed the red from the game
00,02well ash != red (from games)
00,02and red (game) != red (manga)
Does "!=" mean "?"?
=/=
I assume it's equivalant to =/=
0,5============
00,02Gold_Demona, != meens 'not equal'
00,02BaconMane, BACON
00,02BaconMane, try ~~~~~~~~~ over two lines
Phase4: Ah, so ?
/me licks BaconMane
0,5Phase4 no, it looks screwed up in my client.
00,02ah
0,5:>
Phase: Exactly. Three completely separate canons.
Game Red's Pikachu could mop the floor with Ash's Pikachu.
And half of Mt. Silver too, while he's at it
Oh noes, I killed the chat with my ranting. :<
I'm sorry chat! D:
:O
/me licks Gold_Demona :P

Kiryu, yeah no stream atm
Phase4: Hey, I'm from VBA only. I bow to your superiority anyday. XD

Phase4: them red x everywhere
00,02GilDash|Away, visual basic and pascal are fairly similar, as such i hate them both :<
I hope someone play's slender :)
GilDash|Away hiya

00,02also your nick is lies, you are clearly not away

Phase4, is there anything you don't hate? :D
00,02AdamTheDuck, ponies
oooh
Hm what to do
True, true :D
okay so far i like laguna, he is my second favorite final fantasy character, first being Terra naturaly
I hate planes I hate stairs hahaha Francis much? :D
Bronysith: Laguna's pretty cool. I love the moombas. They're adorable. :3
Gold_Demona: i like laguna cause he is not an Emo little bitch
like squall
Bronysith: Exactly.
well squall isnt emo really, just very introvert
but
Bronysith: Squall reminds me a lot of my husband, but more of a jerk.
i havent really played much 8, so i cant really judge
I haven't played 8
but i can tell i am going to like Laguna
All I play is kingdom hearts :P
Bronysith: Laguna's one of my favorite characters in that game.
Actually, I've only played 4, a bit of 5, 6, 7, and most of 9
Gold_Demona: he definetly doesnt have "Strife Syndrome"
Bronysith: What's Strife Syndrome? O_o
Gold_Demona: cloud strife
ASH HAS JUST BEAT THE THIRD PART OF THE POKEMON LEAGUE using kingler and pikachu
some girl is obviosly hitting on you
im sooooooo happy
and you are oblivios that she lieks you
Bronysith: I know who Cloud Strife is, but I don't know what Strife Syndrome is. What does that refer to?
Bronysith: His hair? His giant sword? His existential quandery?
Sephyrot was a *beep* in both kingdom hearts 1 and 2 :S
Gold_Demona: the fact that a girl is hitting on him
and he is oblivious that she likes him
lol
Bronysith: Ah. That. Ok
Kiryu: i predict youre 9
Bronysith: lol yeah
no not really
Bronysith: Sorry. I can't read and type at the same time. XD
Bronysith: And I type slow. :P
The Impossible game comes with pony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFo0kdAr9cE&feature=b-vrec
Kiryu: then why say *beep* instead of bitch
I dont know just cause :$
Gold_Demona: but still, i like cloud as a character
Kiryu: OBJECTION
he is definetly not the worst final fantasy character
LOOKING AT YOU TIDUS
HOLD IT!
and vanille
Bronysith: Me too. Not so much in the spinoff stuffs, but I really like his character in FF7.
Gold_Demona: yea, also ff7 is one of my fav games of all time
Kiryu: the word 'bitch' is not even one of the word's that they beep on tv *speedline effect*YOURE LIEK 8
if not tied with chrono trigger and 6 for first Gold_Demona
Well I'm off to sleep, goodnight everybody :)
Bronysith: I can't really decide on a "favorite game" cuz I like a lot, but FF7 is certainly up there, along with 6.
Gnight, AdamTheDuck. Sleep well.
Night AdamTheDuck
OVER RULED I'm actually ...
Kiryu: i just contradicted you TELL ME YOUR AGE
Gold_Demona: also
try legend of dragoon sometime
VERY AWESOM
15! :|
e
TAKE THAT!
Kiryu: *pshyce lock's*
/me uses the magatama
Bronysith: I'll have to try and find it. *wish me luck cuz that game is super rare*
Gold_Demona: of course i think there is a few copies on ebay for cheap
Kiryu: do you have any proff that youre "15"
or he could emulate it
aww come on im telling the truth here :|
I saw my friend emulate it a while back and it worked perfectly
fine how can I prove it?
Kiryu: .........you didnt awnser my quistion
What's YOUR age, flutterchu, since you seem so insistent on making others share. =P
TAKE THAT!
CrimsonPheonix: he? he who?
Wondering why the Movie Nights cant be Movie Evenings....
Gold_Demona: i seem to not have an intrest of sharing of my birth to any other pony
Gold_Demona, you
you could emulate legend of dragoon
CrimsonPheonix: Silly pony. I'm a she. :P
now who has the pshyce locks?!
well for me everyone is a he until told or proven otherwise
CrimsonPheonix: And yeah, I could. But Playstation emu's are a pain in the butt to get working right. =/
true that is
CrimsonPheonix: Fair enough. Now you know. And knowing is half the battle!
but quite worth it
Kiryu: that's not a lie im just saying what i beleve is the right thing to do
no stream...:'(
I know that feel bro :(
CrimsonPheonix: True also. I had one working really nice once but then my PC went kaput. :<
:(
CrimsonPhoenix: Haven't bothered with a PS emu since
kaput....love that word
I love it too :D
Dammit, why do I keep spelling phoenix wrong? The frickin O comes first!
I should use it more
Gold_Demona, tab is the magic button
Kiryu: you still didnt awnser my quistion
my favorite word is pickle barrel :O
CrimsonPhoenix: That doesn't work on my client. :(
odd....
ah well
Tab does nothing
CUMQUAT
DAMN IT SQUALL
Y U NO SHAKE HANDS AND STOP BEING DICKISH?!
Madsurge: That's what you get when you plant dickweed next to pussywillows, right?
o.o
i have to leave now bye........i guess you mde it scott free Kiryu

Sorry, that was inappropriate. ^^;

Fun fact: there's an italian band that made a song called "Kumquat Land" *spoiler, they mean Italy*
heh
Just wondering has anyone ever collected all 8 pages in slender?
Gold_Demona: also no, I can take dick jokes :D
lol, I figured as much MadSurge. Felt like apologizing for it anyway cuz I don't usually make those sorts of jokes. :P
Kiryu: I think that after that Slender just spawns on top of you :D

Gold_Demona: well I'm no potty mouth either
I've only gotten to six before getin surprise buttsecksd by slenderman :'(
Kiryu: but slenderman is real gentle
not to me :'(
Slenderman only wants hugs <3
I just had visions of a Slenderman childrens show...
"I hug you!~ You hug me!~"
It's genius! 6_9
Gold_Demona: why not? :D
Gold_Demona: it still would be less scary than Barney
"It's the SLENDERMAN SHOW!!! With everyone's bestest best buddy, Slenderman!
those eye's...:'(
Slenderman "Hi kids!"
Kids "Hi Slenderman!"
*static*
pedoslenderman?
:D
Slender man hugs all the kids. The kids all die
You said "Hai, kids!" Instant image of pedobear.
Slenderman "Wasn't that fun?~" 8D
Gold_Demona: and then he asks the cameraman 20$
lol
what if slenderman and pedobear did fusion?
did selphie just break the 4th wall?
o_o
I THINK SHE DID
Kiryu, that'd be truly the most frightening thing ever. o_o
Bronysith: Does Selphie love trains? 8D
gimme 20 dollars :D
Gold_Demona: nah, it would be merely Pedobear with tentacles
no she likes trains
MadSurge: lol
/me gets run over by random train
Which is bad, mind you, but not really that much worse
0,5I LIEK TUTUWES
What the hell! There aren't even tracks here! D:
Hello BaconMane! :)
Ohai BaconMane
what would happen if you drew a smiley face on slendy's face? :P
Kiryu: Someone did that in a comic once. :P
Kiryu: He was decidedly not as scary after that
slendy would let you draw on his face... for 20 dollars :D
http://soundcloud.com/kairaven/discordlicious
rdibp : what that?
>S
:S
Hello everypony......i'm back
and we left like 5 minutes ago :S
Maid_RainBow: that's john delancy doing silliy things
Hello! ECHO ECHO ECHO ECHO
Dark_Horst: hehe Discordlicious that was funny i think he will return in season 3
As a statue.
let's hope he does
ermagherd
this is kewl
Well de Lancie's said countless times he's done another episode
Ninjazz: we all know what you want. More fabulousness~
I thought it was confirmed that DeLancie was returning in Season 3?
is the stream still offline? :S
Kiryu : yes
Gold_Demona: at least, more voiceacting was confirmed
seems like it
MadSurge, Her singing more songs! That and maybe a Celestia song. Oh! And Spa ponies! NEED MORE FABULOUSNESS.
fuuuuuuuuuuuudge :(
MadSurge: Yeah, that's why I said DeLancie and not Discord. :P
Though that WOULD be awesome
Celestia should speek with the TRADITIONAL CANTERLOT VOICE at some point, it would be epic and scary.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNrXMOSkBas&feature=b-vrec
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLqoTFQcrwQ
Ninjazz: we need more awesome villainy
MadSurge, not sure how they'll top Discord or Chrysalis.
Perhaps a Gryphon invasion this time.
hey guys
Or maybe just pull out another new race.
Hey again, alexxm.
At The GALA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rex_Mundi: I want Luna to defeat someone with lightning bolts :D
how are things Ninjazz
05i take it form the links no stream is up
alexxm, slow.
05want a stream guise?
Trixie for s3 villain
yay, Wrekstream soon!
sure, Wrek
OMG ITS LOGAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'd love a stream
Abilities swap maybe? Twilight gets turned into a pegasis, Rainbow a earth pony and Pinkie a unicorn?
TRIXIE EVILYES MAYBE STRONG NO UNLESS SHE FIND SOME POWERSTONE
Wrek: Yes preez! =D
Ninjazz: well, we didn;t know how they would go on after Discord, and we had Chrysalis
05been replacing the fence of the small playground outside our house all day
05could use some relaxation
Rex_Mundi, she doesn't have it in her. If she did, she would've used it when Twilight Sparkle caused the doll incident.
Guys, I'm reading a review for The You Testament (I saw PEwdiepie play it) and here's my favorite thing in the review: Wonka 15:26: “You stole fizzy lifting philosophy! You bumped into the secrets of the universe which now have to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!”
D'aaww. That's pretty kind of you.
Rex_Mundi: Alicorn Pinkie. just think about that. :D
wrek what doom port did you use while streaming?
Wrek: G3 ponies please!
Hello Wrek!
stream lives!
lol wrek i dident even know you were going to stream
i found on Google Street View the Valhalla Motion Pictures :D
hey
and buffer
Good Morning everypony.
HEY there!
MadSurge, Discord was kinda obvious they'd use the EoH. Chrysalis was a surprise on both that she came out of no-where and how she was defeated. Probably the next one will be more advertised as a dangerous sitaution.
http://goo.gl/maps/uoOXE
Ah, classic DOOM?
THETY TALK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQAQA
Good morning everypony!!!!
Hi!
DOOM!
Silly me
NIGHTMARE!
Was Chrysalis named in the actual show? I never heard it.
EWWW CANT SEE
Wirisme, yes
http://derpibooru.org/75886?scope=scpe3125a2fdbbd5d9f1698be5f970a7a7aef2641afa morning everypony :3
Wirisme: Queen Chrysalis, in fact
Ninjazz: we had no news until now, we'll probably get a villain out of nowhere :D
COOL
must rewatch
MadSurge, no doubt. You know how these things usually go. :T
What about Tirak? Twas the best G1 villian.
Did anyone ever play hexen? I loved that game
Ninjazz: I loved that they didn't use the EoH. I hope in fact they never get used again :D
how are things thelonepony
Anyone in the MLP adventure animations of G1 that isn't a pony probably belongs to Marvel
Kill them all with shotgun!
great alexxm and you?
So much buffer
buffer
Why am I getting no stream :[
ok i can see'
i'm good thelonepony
so much blood
Ah, there we go!
MadSurge, what I hope is that they get used but prove ineffective then have to either upgrade it or try something else. Probably like combining them into one giant element. Like the element of Friendship or something like that.
Is it bad that I never noticed all the blood in this game when I was a kid? XP
Ninjazz: Like captain planet?
I'm pretty sure the movies tie in to the My Little Pony and Friends TV series.
Rex_Mundi, EXACTLY LIKE CAPTAIN PLANET! Then a new Princess would be born. "With your elements combined, I AM PRINCESS HARMONY!"
Ninjazz: the villain will just no sell them :D
why did you go that way
Kandarihu: So Hasbro doesnt have the rights to movie related MLP characters?
How about more elements? Maybe a separate mane cast fit for a spinoff or something, bearing the Elements of Victory.
MadSurge, ah well. As much as we know, Derpy could be the new element.
Wasn't there an actual G1 pony named Harmony? Or am I thinking of Care Bears?.... Hmm...
Ninjazz: :D
Er. Villain*
Rex_Mundi, afaik, Marvel's holding on to most of the movie stuff.
The only new spoilers regard a new location. Can't say more >_?
*>_>
I suppose that means no Tirak in G4 then... Speaking of movies, I think there is deffinatly going to be a G4 MLP movie, only a matter of time.
To hell and back again: A space marine's tale by Wrek.
Gold_Demona: :D
MadSurge, and that certain recurring characters get an episode dedicated to them. And that certain non-recurring characters might make a return.
And it definitely will be shown in this country >_> <_<
Kandarihu: yep
So, we know nothing yet :D
doom
die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And I caught wind of another spoiler that I can't possibly be vague enough without spoiling.
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What if s3 turns out to be a story arc
Hasbro is just starving us from information :D
Wirisme: It should happen!!!
Wrisme: could be
Ohai
OK, for the millionth time, good morining
Wirisme, I'd love that. And it would certainly justify a 13 episode season run.
hi
Hi there!
Morning Dark92Engima !
I personally like being left in suspense as to what we can expect from the coming episode. I like being surprised. =)
How are y'all?
Kandarihu: That's what I was thinking
great
Hiyo MaxTheBrony
Heya Gold_Demona !
:)
Let's just quote The HUB's slogan on that: "It Could Happen"
Gold_Demona: :) Reading spoilers helped noone from being blown away by the season finale anyway :D
Rex_Mundi: Let's hope the movie can be as EPIC as Spongebob's movie
I think a story arc would be cool, especially if there are a few more dangerous adventure episodes and a little less slice-of-life episodes.
MadSurge: This is very true
I personally believe a movie won't be made. Not for theatres atleast. It probably will just be another 1hr and a half special.
Wasn't Lauren Faust's original vision for FiM to be more of a magical girl series? That might qualify for being a serial.
Gold_Demona: everyone got so sidetracked in guessing what Cadence was that noone saw the changelings coming :D
Ninjazz: Were talking Hasbro here, they made, what was it? 4 transformers movies, and a battleship movie. I think that Hasbro would deffinatly give MLP movies a shot.
MadSurge: Yeah. Hub was VERY good about not revealing Chrysalis before the episode.
hi everypony!
Hi glennglog22
Kandarihu: Yeah
hi glennglog22
nothing on?
that sucks
Gold_Demona: that's how you advertise a season finale. Lie and deceit about awesome things~
oh there we go
Awww
Yes! i played brutal doom
Violence is on
Rex_Mundi: Even if we kinda-have a story arc in season 1, it would be even better if we could have a more serious one, so the series can adcquire that serious undertone that made Sonic SatAM famous
nice boobs
Rex_Mundi, well see. MLP is a definitive "Girl's Show". No matter what Lauren and her team did to broaden its audience base, it still appeals mostly to girls. I don't think Hasbro would green light it because movies are very expensive and I don't think they're willing to risk it.
play this video after this! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGdLjRnjd6o&feature=plcp
no video links during straeam
Ninjazz well evidence says it would be a god damn smash hit. But yeah hasbro is not willing to risk it
stream*
glennglog22: NO VIDEO LINKS DURING A STREAM
oh sorry
MadSurge: That's how advertising should be done in general for anything. Don't reveal the awesome bits until the audience actually watches it.
OK OK SHEESH
Gold_Demona: yes
Ninjazz: G1 had a movie, why not G4?
glennglog22 it isn't a video being played it's wrek playing the game
glennglog22: No video li--Oh you know it :)
ok
Read rules :3
OK!
gosh
relax
MadSurge: Hub does it right
:p
killerpony7733, I'd still think they'd make an hour special. Kinda like the finale's but without the being a 2 pt episode.
i'm out of here
you are getting real offended by us telling u the rules?
Dark92Engima: I would think a serious baddie that sticks around for more that 2 episodes would be refreashing.
wow...
Rex_Mundi, I think that was more of a pilot. Also, I think things worked a bit differently back in the 1980's with cartoons.
Ninjazz indeed.
Gold_Demona: that's what videogames should do too, don't spoil us awesome battles, just show us vanilla gameplay :D
atleast not here in sweden
Rex_Mundi: of course.......the best series have that kind of story arcs
D:
Outside of anime fans, that is
yeh prob :(
And let;s face it. Anime just isn't mainstream.
02
dat midi
31111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Its getting there tho :)
Ninjazz: Your thinking of the special with Tirak, the 2 G1 TV specials were made before the MLP cartoon, the movie was later on. With G4 season 3 only having a certain number of episodes, G1 and G4 will have the same number of episodes as each other. So yeah, its high time G4 had a movie.
Because I think the movie industry in the US is just too dependant on Hollywood. Instead of willing to translate an entire Japanese movie and so on, they'd rather just go and make a movie that could potentially make millions and get the DVD out.
its getting more accepted here in sweden at last.
atleast*
i come back to see Wrek playing a game
Wb Bronysith
MaxTheBrony: What needs to happen is for people to stop closing themselves to it like all anime is the exact same thing. It's just as diverse as anything else.
Rex_Mundi: what if.......the elements of harmony, are turned into the elements of chaos?
so anyword on if the season 1 dvd will be relased in the UK
wtf
Gold_Demona exactly!
http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard# WTF
Rex_Mundi, Oh! I see your point... Still, conisdering today's stereotypes and the tendencies of most movie go-ers, I don't see a MLP movie getting into theatres.
I'd settle for it being on itunes over here alexxm
Dark92Enigma: :O
Rex_Mundi: and the Mane 6 need to fight back, and get the elements back to normal
ok Wirisme
Gold_Demona: surprised?
Kinda annoyed about that
http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma22s3o6Pd1qgw5m5o1_1280.jpg thats better
Gold_Demona: check out the link i posted
I think we're gonna have to import
Ninjazz: Its the same the other way around, instead of having a forighn cartoon on the air, thy rather just make an anime version ala PPGZ. One guy says that if MLP gets popular on the japanese internet, there could be an anime version of MLP made.
Dark92Engima: That would be a "dun dun dun" moment.
Gold_Demona: why my name didn't ping when you wrote it along with :O
Dark92Engima: Cuz I spelled it wrong the first time. I spelled it "eNIgma"
so much blood
Ninjazz: But yeah, I think there are enough Bronies and little girls with parents that would make an MLP movie worth it to Hasbro.
Hmm, at what point in Canterlot Wedding Pt 2 was Queen Chrysalis's name established? I kinda skimmed through the episode on a time crunch.
Gold_Demona: oh.
Dark92Engima: Then I realized I spelled it wrong after I posted it. lol :P
Kandarihu: maybe one of the writers on DA gave her the name?
Rex_Mundi, we'll see I guess. MLP entirely was a suprise to us. So I'm not making any solid claims.
d
MLP FiM*
Kandarihu: it happened with Dr. Whooves
TIME FOR MORE FINAL FANTASY
Dark92Engima, no. I'm pretty sure we were all calling her Chrysalis coming out of the finale.
Wrek: what game is this?
looks like doom
marathon?
NO WAIT
i give up
Kandarihu Oh..........wonder if they mention their name on the show? It happened for Derpy!
I'm pretty sure the Japanese audiences really prefer their characters to be bipedal humanoid in nature. They tend to have a dislike for mecha that isn't ALSO humanoid. Somehow, ZOIDS got away with it.
Derpy's name was given by 4chan, and then later half-validated by Hasbro
?
:O
Ninjazz: I dont know, it seems to me that MLP is slowly making a toe-hold in japan on the internet, it could happen. Have you ever read Maxiburgers blog? http://maxiburger.tumblr.com/
thats a awesonme gme
Rex_Mundi, actually, no I haven't.
It's a small amount of Japanese bronies none-the-less.
Kandarihu: Yeah, this MLP in japan thing is so interesting, its like a reverse anime situation. its so cool watching them talk about one of our shows for a change.
Ninjazz i would say in general i haven't seen that many asian bronies tbh
plus it made in usa
I had people order pony merch from singapor and indonesia, but never japan
killerpony7733, well I'm half Asian if that counts for anything. :p
killerpony7733: There are a fair number of bronies from Taiwan.
Sure but i'm just saying the general number isn't too high compared to the western countries
buffer
killerpony7733, but yeah. The humor in MLP doesn't really translate easily to most Asian cultures.
the majority is in the angloshpere. 75 to 85%
That's where localization comes in. Stick in humor that would work well and have the same effect.
Yaaay more Plutonia!
Hmmm
Uuuhhhh
Not an easy thing to do, but if done right, makes for an awesome dub.
The characters are certainly Moe (moe-eh) enough to be attractive to the japanese audience. Applejack sems to be the most popular in japan.
I thought Fluttershy would've.
Gold_Demona: my dream job, localization :)
he cant find his save o shit
MadSurge: I hear people give a lot of guff to dubs that use localization, but I really think it's necessary sometimes for a really good dub.
Ninjazz: I did too, Flutter is popular, but applejacks "manly handsomness" seems to get lots of likes. Shes an ikemen and an Onee-san
why is stream keep laging?
Rex_Mundi, Hmmmm. Wonder if AppleDash is prevalent with most ship lovers. Or maybe even FlutterJack somehow.
hey guys
Gold_Demona: yep
was up?
MadSurge: But sometimes, the dub is just too unbearable to watch...
tf2 scraft 2
Gold_Demona: if the dub is bearable though why not watch it? :3
did stream end?
you so byffer
Gold_Demona: Same here. I miss things when I have to read and watch the movie.
Wrek is Laging i think
MadSurge: That's what I mean though. Most of the time, I prefer to watch a dub.
MadSurge: There aren't many examples, but there are a few series where I just can't watch the dub cuz it's that bad.
05tell me when/if it cleares
bungie???
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
...no buffe?
*r?
Wrek: what game are you playing again?
I know that a guy whos are keeps getting on Drawfriend, is a Japanese brony.
Gold_Demona: one example?
Gold_Demona: What's the worst dub you've ever seen?
*art
Eh. Morning.
lag
MadSurge: CardCaptors. I prefer the original, Cardcaptor Sakura.
Ah
Gold_Demona: did you watch some of the MLP italian dub? :D
I like the dub for 'Monster' and 'welcome to the NHK'.
I honestly despise most english dubbed anime. There's a whitelist of series with good dubs, and to my knowledge, that list is short.
Gold_Demona: I'll have to check those out!
MadSurge: I watched clips of the Italian MLP, but I haven't watched any full episodes.
I imagine if MLP does get a dub or an anime adaptation, that it will be interesting to hear the voice acteors picked for our beloved ponies.
Gold_Demona: Imo it's decent, but alas, a few voices aren't that great
Kandarihu: There are some good ones -- Spice & Wolf and Ergo Proxy are pretty good.
Kinixys: For bad Lupin English dub, I highly recommend The Fuma Conspiracy and Bye Bye Liberty. Also the Streamline dub of Cagliostro.
05has it sorted?
05or are you jsut not caring?
Wrek: no lag anymore
MadSurge: I agree. From the clips I've seen of it
Wrek : no lag YAY!
.....spoke to soon
No lag here, Wrek.
Gold_Demona: the Twilight and Fluttershy are pretty good, and Pinkie rages really well :D
MadSurge: The Spanish dub isn't too bad either. At least that one I can understand completely. lol XD
brb
Hey guys what's up?
Gold_Demona: shame for screaming Fluttershy though :D
Hiyo YourLittleDashie
hi YourLittleDashie
Imma bring some D'aww to this stream
MadSurge: Yeah, that kinda sucked. XD
05oh fuck off
Or figuring a character to be dead in which his/her survival was handwaved, and all of a sudden, the name is never referred to in the present-tense anymore.

Has Scoot-Scootaloo been on?
PAHAHAHAHAHAH big mac
MadSurge: :D
Pearly has returned
no'
Hey Pearly
and get lost everwhere
Well I'm sold!
So can you play this game completely ignoring the story?
not really
Snowflake: Was that meant for me?
i did try lolz and ot lost
well this stream is akward :$
yes
indeed it is akward
Who's streaming?
How so?
05what do you mean awkawrd?
^
yup like i did
I don't find this awkward at all
it just gives of that feeling of akwardness
I wish the levels were more varied
Kiryu you starred in 2 godzilla movies
hey SafariMonkey
yes yes i did :D
What exactly is on stream, atm? I can't see what you all and your better internets are looking at.
Who's playing?
Ninjazz: The game Marathon.
Kiryu Eh too used to the internet awkward is very indifferent from my normal routines on the interwebs
Ninjazz: We're watching Wrek play Marathos: Rubicon
Marathon*
...then how the hell could it be awkward? o_O
How'd I misspell that? S and N aren't anywhere NEAR each other. O_o
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Zecora Back in Stock on Toys R' Us Website
lol
So it *is* Wrek, I thought it was. And who doesn't recognise marathon instantly?
Your voice is awesome, Wrek. =D
I can't stop listening to gangnam style :P
wait new EQD!?
Wrek yeah that is more true. But years on the internet and having grown a immunity to lots of things on it. Awkward most things aren't in all honesty :P
SafariMonkey: Me, because I never heard of it until I started watching Wrek play it. :P
and plus marthon you can look up and down didyou notice that?
i have a luna plushie <3 its next to my pillow
nice
I have a lyra plushie :D
Gold_Demona: Ikr
I have NOTHING :'(
me 2
I but a lowly McD's AJ toy.
have*
joking I have spike rainbow dash pinkie and luna :$
And a MLP postcard somewhere. Forgot where I put that thing.
Ninjazz: next, a Raritoy!
Wrek: Is this the remastered version?
MadSurge, I WISH! ;_;
Wow! That's some heavy delay there
Wrek well i know it's your stream most of the time by just looking. I made a habit of knowing any of the mods who stream :D
So what game is that?
And punch ALL the things @o@
Nife: Marathon
how bout they stream some slender? :P
SafariMonkey: Don't worry about it. There are plenty of things I've never heard of that lots of other people have. :P
Kiryu god no.
Nice transportation effect!
And vice versa
god yes :[
Kiryu: only GOOD games. :|
'
^*
slender is a good game :(
MadSurge slender is given too much credit for what it's worth. and it's overplayed to death
It's not even funny anymore
Only if you play it like it's not meant to play, Kiryu
actually I really like it
I never found Slender funny to begin with. I'm not sure what's so great about it.
Gold_Demona: That's why I felt bad, I realised that it could have come off as insinuating that people who hadn't heard of it were ignrant/stupid.
Its fun how when you know slendy is close you get a rush
It's funny watching someone on youtube beat Slender. XD
Gold_Demona: two best friends play had one of the guys running at Slendy to try and punch him :D
SafariMonkey: Yeah, it's easy to do that with text.
Its fun really slender is a good game :(
MadSurge: LOL, Isn't the point of the game to stay AWAY from Slendy? XD
Slender, with its anticlimatic ending :D
Gold_Demona: He just wants hugs :(
Gold_Demona: and it was the one that usually hates horror games :D
dont spoil the endinh I havent beat it yet! :'(
MLP_Brovakiin: Oh yeah. I keep forgetting. Slenderman with his childrens show. I remember now.
... "ending" ... XD
Kiryu: Don't worry, I won't.
Alright, I'll be quiet about it.
Wrek tea and coffee two things i love
Gold_Demona: Yeah. And I know some people who would have reacted to me with "No I haven't f-in heard of it, you got a problem with that?"
Nife: There's an ending? It's not one of those "no win" games?
Gold_Demona: actually I think that's it :D
Gold_Demona: I shall say nothing 8)
Nife: SSSHHHHSSHHH!
well I dont know but still no spoilers :[
SafariMonkey: lol, Yeah. You'll have that form time to time. =P
Nife: lol, alrighty then. XD
/me prepares himself to spoil the ending of Tetris.

Sumi thinking what to do
6Ok,thx ^^
Hog, his accent is terrible.
Dat random spanish words
God*
well until those eggs are alien eggs, there´s nothing to be scared of
When you're casting for a hispanic character and making him say random Spanish words, you should at least hire somebody who can speak Spanish without an accent. ><
np
Is that the solar system?
Plot mass relay jump
Lul
Go shopping after that nvm save the universe
Gold_Demona: actually there's a type of italian swearing that likens God to a hog/pig... :P
MadSurge: LOL, well then. XD
What is Tali like under the mask?
Me neither. I only take characters I like. :P
I think I can leave this on from now on
MadSurge: A photoshopped stock image. :P
Gold_Demona: like Mare Do Well? :D
6What's the second one for?
MadSurge: Yes, exactly
Gold_Demona: I mean, is she a mammal or a fish or an insect...?
That gay colour :D
:)
The sims glitched and the mouse disappeared :/
:O
hi everyone :)
hi Lil_B
MadSurge: She looks like a mammal. But that's just going by the one crappy picture. Which is literally a random stock photo of a woman that was photoshoped to look like an alien.
Hey guys I'm back :)
hi Lil_B !
6D:
I HAAAATE when that happens
Gold_Demona: :D terrible

Gold_Demona: that's one of the reasons I dislike Star Trek, all aliens are too humanoid
Me!

Is Sumi a Twilight fan?

Gold_Demona: that's true
OMG ITS Scoot-Scootaloo

I forgot its been so long :P
Wrek: maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe
/me looks through maid outfits
btw is mala... well TAB doesn't work and I don't see him in the List so I guess he isn't here -.-
Lil_B: we actually have a department at the uni consisting of 3 technicians. All they do is they fix broken glassware. We send the pieces up to them and they heat them up and fix them. Probably that's why our glassware sucks...
lol ok
NOMNON she is handicapped :/ And no its not a S3 spoiler. Lauren said it in an interview
Wrek Welp depending on what you need i can EASILY fund you~
05Bronysith: buy me one and ill draw you a free comission T~T
Lil_B: oh and of course if you break anything, you pay for it.
Wrek: sounds like a plan, i will have to get in contact with this motherfucker
Wrek awww i could buy one for you too :D
I give up. What's the game?
...
Alchemist our school just said "Everybody pay 100€ upfront for everything you might break and the chemicals you use and 5€ for the pile of paper we have to print for you" :/
mass effect
SafariMonkey: Mass Effect 3
hia LadyCanary
Hiyo LadyCanary

Hey LadyCanary !
HEY LadyCanary

Alchemist nope, but I already broke a 70€ Oswald Viskosimeter (I hope thats also the english name) soooo... I guess I wouldn't get it anyway
Should I dump the girl in person or over a text?
05Bronysith: I COULD KISS YOU
05BUT IM IN A RELATIONSHIP SO I CANT
Dovah: That's the one I have
05BUT I WOULD
Wrek: okay, ill let you know when i pay him and the commission or whatever
YourLittleDashie: oh sorry then kill it with 18 tons of xerum 525
Wrek: i wouldnt mind a kiss...but lets spar one day
Dovah: Better :)
Bronysith ya lucky pony :D
Me jelly
YourLittleDashie: umm the radiation from that could wipe out asia....
Yay Wreky ^____^
:)
Dovah: :O
/me hugs LadyCanary<3
why is this game called MASS Effec? Every Time I heard this nanme I have to think about Gravy and and other Laws of Physics
Lil_B: that sucks. And yes, its called an Ostwald viscosymeter in english. I used it too.
YourLittleDashie: well at the very least a large portion
Bring me some unumpentium and i will be happy
/me gives cachi01|phone unumpentium
HURRY UP TAOUMI
i need to get this shit made for Wrek
cachi01|phone how about some ununoctum? at least thats stable for some more microseconds
/me will never die now
/me feeds everyone muffins then dashes away
Lil_B: in that case 100 euros is not THAT much. Its the average price of a lab grade mercury based thermometer.
Lil_B: I think it refers to the Mass Relays, which are used to jump from system to system.
Lil_B but ununpentium makes you a zombie!
:(
Hi CCCP

Wrek: fine
Nevermind

Abit too slow

/me gives Wrek le ban war axe
I dunno, I'm tempted to just go through the game and see the bad ending first
BRB
Instead of quitting he could just use /nick :I
name be changed!!
05and no allcaps
dammit
6xDDD
to the moon and back
Sometimes I'll see them walk around the front of a moving car to get to a person on the other side of it.

6I've had one of my sims drown in grass..
DerpyMuffins: Its basicly about me trying to de-jerkify blueblood
05gotta love power abuse
XD
Aaand he quits again instead of using /nick
How does the work?
that*
Move them out of the pool?
I did not know about /nick
Run for ends of left and right will help a lot
6Nah.. :P
Lots of people are ignorant of IRC commands
The /nick command is so useful
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
6Sec,I'll show you :P

JESmith71 XDD
Genius
All thats under her visor is Another Visor
6:O TS1 :D
I've tried looking in my wardrobe but its not there! :'(
What?
MASF123: dont mind my awesome english skills
cachi01|phone speaking about gondor... where was gondor when Sstuff happened?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: I did that once, but with sunglasses
Supergayman not at all
.
Where was Gondor when the Reapers came? >=(
Where was gondor when gondor was missing?
6The Sims 1 :P
Where is Waldo in this vid?
Waldo stole gondor
Where was Gondor when no one could find Waldo?
ok i have a good name now
oh haha
What if waldo was hiding in gondor and thats why no one can find him :o
00,10how about you just pick a name that dos'e piss people off
sound is trolling me
What is Waldo was Gondor in disguise?
Audio's starting to derp
No sound?
Carmen Sandiego called, she's with Gondor and Waldo, but she said she'll stay with them and they won't tell us -.-
Oh Sumica, hi
Sumica: does this name annoy you in any way?
cachi01|phone: waldo stole gondor
Say 'Narnia' if you've tried looking for Narnia
Nonono. THAT'S where Gondor was! Carmen Sandiego STOLE Gondor.
AAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHH I'M ALERGIC TO YAY'S!! THERE TO CUTE!!
Narnia lol
I was obsessed with narnia like for 4 months
Joy: I dont have to, I FOUND narnia
WHat does Hans_Gunter mean anyway?
6Gah..now I wanna play.. ._.
Sumica: dick move, why u no just answer?!
Well the game audio's messed up at least, but I'm still hearing the yay pings
MASF123: its just 2 names
DoctoDoctorWho: You did?
00,10tell you what pic a less stupid name or get out
/me dies
Sumica: fine, but i liked this name
Burn! :D
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Acquiesce
Joy: yeah, It was In my 9th grade science teacher's closet.
Hans is a normal german name and... gunter (or rather "Gunther" ) too, but both aren't family names, just normal person names
PinkieDash story ;S
:S
00,10right then
Oh hell no Pinkie Dash do not mix together..
Homage and Pip I accept
oh hey here's a nice guide http://i.imgur.com/NIUxV.jpg
They mic about as well as any other slash pairing. :P
00,10seems he's at a loss and cant think of any thing
eeyup
Dat ban
Do you think it would be better to put the link to here in one of my spyro vids? Cuz nobody who doesn't care about spyro is gonna actually watch the video.
did he really got ban?
Sumica: Testing how much of a delay between me posting this and the ping actually sounding
who got banned
Who got banned?
6Sure
MEElectronics M11 looks nice CrimsonPhoenix
00,10if he just wants to pick names to be offensive then he can leave
So it's most likely gonna be only fans that will actually see it.
15 seconds
The guy who was trolling with his name
It was a obvious but god damn bad troll tbh
Have to remember that in the future
Sumica what does Hans_Gunter mean?
I might change my name to Xyro cause Kakumy is my very very old name
I don't undertand trolls.
dat name changes
6Yeah
If my B movie ever gets picked I want to time an "Oh my" at just the right moment
DocSane trolling is funny when you success
I'm gonna get so pissed at myself if a bunch of trolls come haha
DocSane facebook is perfer for trolling =D
6xDD
Perfect*
Someone should choose Paranormal Activity for either movie A or B
A friend of mine spent a year trolling me about my liking MLP
Its a B
Proving that even adults act like middle schoolers on Facebook
It made me laugh instead of screaming
6*le_sigh* Watching my old crappy Spyro glitch-relatedish videos makes me kinda wanna play again..
Admiral Hackett is best boss. =)
It was on the human fluttershy vid.
Human?
Except my crew, who all got killed
Okay, would The Wizard be a B, and Star Trek: First Contact be an A? Those may be future choices for me
Hey wait how do you get in the lottery to choose and episode or movie
If you report them and put the URL of the vid it pops up with all his comments.
We are the apex race and the reapers shall pay their tribute in blood

And hello everypony. :)
Hi klumzee!
Hey Klumzeedragon
hi Klumzeedragon
Why does Shepard look so...Borgish, here?
If there are trolls showing up cant you remove their comments?
You need to enter an e-mail though and answer a survey.
DocSane: Cause he's mad with power and evil.
Oh, wait, because he's playing as a total renegade, right?
Fakkin surveys
MASF123: if there's no survey?
Well I'm not voting The Wizard for a while. |That'll be my second choice if the one I've been voting for months ever wins
Then I guess it won't register

Ah. Well thats why he died then. I wanted the Krogans. :P

Thunder-Crescent: By saying Sumica's name. The Fluttershy Yay is his ping.
Kakumy: In real life or in this game?
Game duh...
Kakumy i predict it will take about 9001 years
Sumica
6xDDD I was only a little kid as well..the red ones freaked me out quite a bit for some reason.. :3
Kakumy: Pretty sure no.
Theres red ones? O_o
Thunder-Crescent: It's Sumica's ping. And his 'WHOA!' is for Sumi and the 'Oh my" is for Mica. :D
:)
Ok, we can stop needlessly pinging him now. :P
ruptured eardrums are fun
and painful :(
The Bassheads are coming!

He like's it though!
6Yeah..In YotD at least..Blue ones have normal speed,yellows are a bit faster or something and red ones require supercharge
Dropping their wubs on our heads!
wub cannon OH SHI-
Oh, good. They got rid of that stupid resource mining thing from ME2?
By typing in Sumica, you can hear the magical "Yay" in this video. :3

I don't understand what your lookign for..
Creepy...

DocSane sry, I just came back and saw you messege XD
no reapers are the mechanised version of their creators who of which the reapers turne against due to the catalyst

Hopefully people come here when someones actually on.
I love that Italian Opening of FiM, however a guy in this chat once told me that the italian dub sucks, so that's a shame.

Gold_Demona: Probably both. XD

:P

S
alexxm: Things have been better :D Ive had a headache for 3 days straight x_x
Kandarihu faaaake
What did Allegr0 & Gigabit talk about during their podcast last night?
They annouce a special April Fool's episode, and they do a story with the G3.5/3.6 characters?
It'd actually be kind of funny
hope you feel better RaveBrony
If it was the first episode tough
Then I did the same thing, but for kicking anyone who sends two messages within a span of 365 days
Two things
Thanks, alexxm :)
Then we'd all be like NOooooo, then it goes good again and we're happy

Natural rights come with responsibility. Having free speech means we don't use that free speech to intentionally agitate other people.

BladedWings: I think he only voices pinkie in the first one. And rarity in the first one too.
MASF123: naw, just a real nice guy ^_^
I've been to 2 local conventions but not an actual brony conventon
every panel I went to had ponies breaking out into song :D
kinda, im STILL looking for some good drum samples haha
I expect nothing less from this fandom
Klumzeedragon: egoraptor...didnt sound like him lol
6:O
I said I'll never attend a cFiM being the strong show it is convinced me to go. @_@
Only con i go to is Con-comics
con
Cypresswolf: was there a lot of drinking?
Mexican comic con
the snare i found turned out to be not the good after i listened to it for a bit haha
And next year im going to bronymexicon
i only went to a local con...but i still had fun non the less :)
BladedWings: I know right? I had no idea until I read about it on HotDiggedyDemons website. :D But I guess the Rarity from Apple.MOV KIND of sounds like him.
So much history
I DONT WANNA GO ALONE
6D:
Klumzeedragon: hmmm, might have to go watch them again
cachi01}phone I didn't want to go alone either but it happen for me.
Next year I wonna go to the next GalaCon, BUCK and to GamesCon... or what the name was >.<
what else...Costumes! I saw a Robo Dash 5000, Starswirl the Bearded, 3 Discords, 2 Dr. Whooves, Vinyl Scratch, a few Flutterguys, Chrysalis, Rarity, Gala Applejack...think that about covers it
cachi01|phone: If you're in Cali, I'll go to Equestria LA with you. :P
Klumzeedragon im not
:(
Im.in mexico
Sumica: You should see this scene with the DLC character. It's interesting
Bronymexicon
I'm in New Jersey
cachi01|phone: Move. :D
Lol nope
Cypresswolf: was there a lot of drinking at the cons?
In Bronypoolza there was.
I'm in Britain so that's pretty much me not going :P
twilight_sprinkle: the drinking ponies panel was canceled just before it was scheduled to start - at the end of the Whooves Line game, the staff told us hotel policy doesnt allow alcohol on the floor - so Barbetos & I drank in my room after
It was from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. in last Bronycon
ANd Tara got drunk. LMAO.
Cypresswolf: ok, i dont like drinking..
MASF123: she did?O_o
Yeah
haha
woooooooooooooow
Wirisme: You know of any british ones
:D drunk tara
:(
Maybe Buck next year
:) I think I won on account I had 1 cup of whiskey before he got there
SHe said, "MaKE way for the Queen of the Bronies!!!!
Lol.
MASF123: Drunk Twilight Sparke. Lol
Sounds like something she' d do. She seems like a fun lover. :D
MASF123: oh god :D
i dont want to see a drunk twilight :(
twilight_sprinkle: that would be scary and somehow funny
the voice acting that mst have happened
And suddeny, DashWithRainbows .
:O
IM BACK everypony
Unfortuantely I left early that day. But I had like 8 bronies tell me that when I came back 2nd day.
wb Bronysith
Hi, Bronysith!
I kinda don't like how much Tara is calling herself "Queen of Bronies" but at least it's not affecting me much
Welcome back Bronysith
wb Bronysith
Lies, I'm never here.
wb Bronysith
Welcome back Bronysith
hia Bronysith :)
Bronysith: well Im FRONT! yeah, what now? never thought of that now didja?
I think the drinking ponies was supposed to be the,m playing some episodes and the staff having rules prepped - maybe different levels based on mane 6 - and see who could stay in the game the longest
/me sets DoctoDoctorWho on fire
Lil_B and Luren Faust she recieves credit for the WHOLE show no one else matters. >_>

PillowPoni: but IM the one who just transformed into the fire retardent pineapple! what about me?:'(
Boss battle

allright :) i havent actually seen the ending that is suppose to be worthless yet :)
Who is playing , Wrek?
DoctoDoctorWho: Okay, you're random as well but someone might eat you
okay, the magic system in final fantasy 8 is interesting
MaxTheBrony Sumica is :)
/me eats a piece of DoctoDoctorWho. :) You're nummy is what you are~
MaxTheBrony: Sumi
Ah
I haven't played it but that draw system sounds like the most annoying thing in the world Bronysith
I didnt know he had a voice ^^
DoctoDoctorWho: is it done?
Wanna talk about random stuff?
There's no point in it, might as well just merge magic and items
CANNON PINGAS
DoctoDoctorWho: By the way, I need a link to your fanfic. :P
When is the new episodes airing?
MLP
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.

Klumzeedragon: darnit, didnt say in time that the pineapple was made of rabid monkies, oh well.

Dem stupid cutscenes
BLOODY SHIT
And no everypony, fic r not done yet.

U SUCK KAI LENG
So far i cant complain , seems action filled.
ANd then Shepard forgets he has Bioticw
*Biotics
but how is the rp feeling of the third game?
:o
is it better or worse?
im not gonna google tr
anslate that
DoctoDoctorWho: will you stop talking and finish your damn fic!
MaxTheBrony: minimal
... why is EQD posting this now? The Deadline for the Entry in Remix War V was Last Week... on September 1!
MaxTheBrony: at least regarding the gameplay
I don't see why people moaned about the ending, I quite liked it :)
actioned out
:(
6To be honest I don't remember what it means even though I've sung it a million times.. :P
MLP_Brovakiin: It was fine... but very... anticlimatic and meh.
MLP_Brovakiin: so far i havent seen anything bad about this game, these 4 mins ive been here.
Lil_B they went into slowpoke mode, they dropped the ball on some news lately.
MLP_Brovakiin: but the ending is noneistent. what we got was an indoctrination hallucination. nothing lse
So who's Asian Persuation that just flew off?
Heya Lil_B :)
lol
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates September 9th (Afternoon)
We've failed...utterly.
MLP_Brovakiin: there's a bonus scene that shows shepard drawing in breath in the rubble of london afterward, btu thats about it
Dovah: Im working past writers block alrite! not completley stopped but still grinding along.
i found an ok snare pack and maybe a good kick pack
Alchemist that's... I mean... a 1 week delay -.-
You got mail
hi there MaxTheBrony :)
Lil_B: yep
there absolutely nothing closing about the ending. we dont know what happens to earth, to the reapers, to the galaxy
http://www.meetup.com/BronyCon/photos/9475122/135243442/#135243472 Tara partying in BronyPalooza!
DoctoDoctorWho: well im procrastinating like a PRO!
MaxTheBrony: The game is great. Leading up to what you feel is going to be an amazing ending, then its extremely anti-climatic and just like... Well... that... didnt go out as I thought.
ah
:)
i see
And thats why all the hate was brought up?
it just ends wiothout telling you how it ends
WHat hate? :O
:p on the game
6^^
Oh
it?
MASF123........dat ass........
Yes...Dat ass
MaxTheBrony: did you play it?
I played the seccond one , im not sure if im going to buy the third.
just saw some Videos of New Super Mario Bros WiiU ... well... at least some Improvements, Mario (and especially New Super Mario Bros) has been extremly stagnent latly... but I really love the rafics in this new one, quite the style XD a Van Gogh like Background in a ghost level XD
man
I LOVE YOU LAGUNA
MaxTheBrony: well, if you'd play it from first to last, you'd understand very well while so many people were angry about the ending
ah
Dark_Horst: it is still a good overall game
man... I think that's the first time I said, "I like this Mario Game because of the Grafixs" ... :/
MaxTheBrony: it is still an overall good game
MaxTheBrony: it just...has no ending. it would've been an improvement if earth wuld've been vaporized. but what we got was just nothinjg
It seems good , atleast better than most that came out.
wow, in the kick pack, they had a sample of someone saying "kick" XD
I liek this mario game because of the grafics???....... Man idk why but that sounds.so wrong lol
xD
in terms of gaming.of course
6xD
Mario, graphics? pffft who needs em for mario :)
uh oh
^^
the game itself is good. but when a game that relies so heavy on story and athmosphere screws the fnale up liek that, you kinda feel ripped off
Yeah true
cachi01|phone not "because of grafics" but the design of the background rellay looked good
Im to lazy , anyone have a pic for example :)?
Lil_B: Meh. I think the WiiU is going to be the only thing that keeps Nintendo floating. But it all depends on their choices... I honestly think Nintendo may be going down in the near near near future.
6Scatter,Senbonzakura.
Sumica: y u no stream anymore!?
I dont want nintendo to die :(
Bronysith: Game crashed
Aww, its over.
Next zelda releases in 2 years
Klumzeedragon not near future, the money they have in the bank is enough to get yearly losses for the next 30 years
:P
cachi01|phone: They've been making TERRIBLE decisions. :D
I think sumica is eating or something
00,10origin died on me
lol
GODDAMIT EA
Aww!
the WiiU ... people who played it really say it works good and it's really light + the Fanbase of Nintendo is big enough to keep the WiiU profitable and the 3DS is already at the protiable point
profitable*
Sumica: it is origin, whatcu expect
Lil_B: Aye, maybe. But they keep spending so much on remaking 5 versions of the same systems and losing even more money. I honestly don't think they can hold on if they keep doing that. They're panicking and throwing out as much as the can at once for what they think will sell.
... reminds me... I haven't seen This week in games for this Saturday
speaking of origin , and games... Anyone of you have syndicate?
Is it just me or did stream die?
Origin is EA's Steam?
yeah
MaxTheBrony: i dont play crap
Yes
So Origin crashing whlie a game is running kills the game?
dat Aj and applebloom
00,10yeah
Love that pic
Bronysith xD true, but i bought the crap for 2 £ so pfffft its was worth it.
:)
Kandarihu: EA has to know exaclty what you are doing 24/7
Dat pic is just so full of dawws
i bought Red Faction guerilla for 1 dollar
Wtf?

Dr.who*
this weather just has that final fantasy feel for me
thelonepony: what?!?! what is it?!?!
Dat adventures of merlin <_<
Suddenly Doctor Who
Klumzeedragon that's what Nintendo always did, they did it since before they made Video Games Systhems, and it worked well for them since forever, their motto is "Creating Something Unique" and when you want to make a System, that's so unqiue that has to hold for 5-6 years, you need to develop a lot into it

I thought monks were suposed to be a peaceful and non-violent people
Welp
cachi01|phone: that show? i think u spelled it wrong
These monks are kick ass
PillowPoni pls
only violent when they need to be
Lil_B: But not so much that a year after you buy it there's 4 new versions that run 100x better.
they train their kick ass skills when they dont need to be so they can kick ass when they do need to be :3
aaaaaaaah

All the bronys choose ally dk

fucking hell
i love laguna so much
00,10I played horde first
00,10then my friends went aliance
FINALLY
/me never saw the appeal to WoW and therefore, never played it before
00,10so i went aliance

general Question: Has somebody played Cobalt?
Its so weird how they pronounce ma'am. Sounds like mom.
/me hugs Bronysith back :3
SuperBrony64 blaspphemy everyone know Jakob is far superior.
SuperBrony64: We know you went with the EdwardxJacob.
Alice was the only tolerable character of that series. also emmet
Final fantasy <3
perhaps its the other way around then, all the ally dks go pony!
I need to go

Bronysith the main character (what was his name...) was such an Emo... right his name was Squall
05worlds best terran managed to beat a full on swarm host zerg :D

00,10nice wrek
Lil_B: terra is my fav final fantasy character, cloud and laguna are tied for 2nd
00,10would like to see how he did it
05never thoguth warhouds would be viable agaisnt non mech
Dovah: The one whose rules you shouldn't talk about
05thoguht*
05thought*
ff6 <3
00,10warhounds?
MaxTheBrony: Who framed Roger Rabbit
Wirisme: ikr
Ah
Dark92Enigma: what he said
:D
Bronysith: FF8 was my favourite cause it was my first. :P
Dark92Enigma: there are alot like that which one are you talking about spicificly :P
I remember that line.
unholy DK was fun
Klumzeedragon, same with me and FF6
spawn 10 zombies, then your pet zombie, and send them all at someone
Klumzeedragon: and 7 is my fav cause it was my first
Dovah: YOU'LL find out Friday Night
Bronysith I think Gogo is the best Character of FF6
Any Luna fans here?
For Winterfell!
05Sumica: the walking big mech units
DerpyMuffins, me
so werewolves are aliens?
DerpyMuffins maybe...
Creepy....
05that are smaller than thors
Lil_B: well you are wrong
D:
Dark92Enigma: Damnit say it!!!!
DerpyMuffins: yay luna!
Dark92Enigma: I want my lols!
Bum Rush is OP
00,10must be a new unit
05it is
Would you be mad if someone called Luna a monster?
D:
Yes
yea
Bronysith awww, but he has so much character :(
05it has an special abillity that is only usable agaisnt mechanical units
DerpyMuffins, explain yourselfÉ
05and since zerg doesnt have mechanical units
Because Luna is the best princess
?**
05peopel never use them
05apparently they're still viable
Bronysith: I could never really get into 7. Probably because I only got to play it at friends houses and everytime I went over I had to start from the beginning and just got sick of it. :D
DerpyMuffins: ............. point me in his direction
Just wanted to know people's reactions that all
creepy
DerpyMuffins, Well it would depend on the reasoning
DerpyMuffins: so no luna hate?
Dovah.........THE FIGHT CLUB!
I domt think anything said about a character in MLP would offend me...
LAGUNA YOU CRAZY
I had my fun.......
damn it
Kandarihu: I don't think I've played 6. I've gotten 1-5. 8. 10-12. :D
now i play as squall again
Allways playing the Creepy wizard
ah, so it is a bot
My god I've seen too much Doctor Who today
D:
Well I kinda made Luna think she was a monster in my fanfic
>too much
Dark92Enigma: nooo! you fool!
OH THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
he wants dragons
oh wait, wrong series
What does he want?
xD
The throne
That's one sexy werewolf.
The were wolf is cute :3c
Dr House: Its NOT lupus.
The Iron throne :3
DoctoDoctorWho: I fell in the trap......DAMN YOU DOVAH
That's a more convincing wereworlf than Lupin from Prisoner of Azkaban
"krikey, what a buet"
HAHA doc cD
Dark92Enigma: lol
*xD
Well, looks more like a werewolf than Lupid did
Whats up Doc?
Klumzeedragon, it might be a good idea to play it soon. If there were any mods who streamed Emulators, Pony Fantasy VI would be seen by now. From what I've seen, it's pretty much a ponification of the whole game.

Dark92Enigma: of course

This reminds me of Aliens
WOOD! FUCK-MY-SHIT
another one off the bucket list

This werewolf is the only thing keeping me here right now, cause I have places I need to go... but... werewolf. D:
I HOPE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY......WOOD!
Bad timing Rose

Lets get reading
haha
Sexy glasses :3
BOOKS!
Am I the only the that things the Doctor looks better in glasses?
thinks*
Other movies , they grab guns , in this they grab books.
Dark_Horst: fun fact: the pronunciation of "were" is a bit similar to blood in hungarian, therefore in hungarian a werewolf is called blood wolf.
the doctor thinks he looks smarter with them
NOPE, PillowPoni :3
00,10it fears tow Missles
PillowPoni: Tennant wore the glasses as a tribute to the 5th Doctor

Wrek: So the new Deus Ex was good? I never got to try it yet.
05they are hopign to get their hands on deus ex 4 after thsoe
Sumica: but they closed it when they were leaving

05Klumzeedragon: its my favorite game of this decade
So.........the werevolves are vurnerable to WATER???

Dark92Enigma: WEAKSAUSE WEAKNESS!!

no they're vulnerable to friendship
BladedWings: only it's Mistletoes water
Mr.Badass

Dark92Enigma: oh yea, forgot about that
Ouch

Prepare to meet Kali........IN HELL
00,10nice line

05yeha
Dark92Enigma: Indiana Jones?
:)
05im bretty excited about the future of deus ex
Temple of Doom
Wrek wait how can they continue the Deus Ex series cause it already had the first sequel and prequel you can't really go any other place now
Alchemist eeeeeeyup
Kandarihu: ...now im imagining Donald w/ and egg beater arm and retractable shades saying "I never quacked for this..." :D
so, moon overdose?
05deus ex:HR had some flaws
MOOOOOOOOON
TO THA MOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAA
MOONLASER!4
A continiation?
bee-yeeeetch
Sketch_Toku_Brony, rofl
Wrek: Oh my. I'll definitely have to give it a shot. :) I always thought it looked good, but never went for it. But you have similar tastes as me so I trust your judgements. :P
05but was a great addition to the franchise
TASTE THE MOONBEAM, MOTHERFUCKER!
In the name of the moon, I shall punish you!
IMA FIRIN MAH LAZAH!!
00,10wolf jeasus was bbq'ed for your sins
How about an auged cop fighting with a keyblade instead of a gun.
and thus Luna saved the day
and thus the doctor kills another.
Obsidian: Sailor Moon reference FTW
Wrek: i have yet to play a perfect game *cough* chrono trigger *cough, cough* have you played a game that has no flaws yet?
Sumica: How much shall we worship Wolf Jesus?
doctors body count is somewhere in the hundreds of trillions at this point.
luna killed a werewolf
Sumi: Can we eat him?
often*
:O
PillowPoni, not at all
:o
VICTORY SCREECH!
O.o
05Bronysith: a game that has no flaws... besides tetris... DOOM.
Oh-lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
05DOOM feels great in every aspect
Werequeen! or queenwolf or whatever
05period
infact, of fictional characters the doctor probably has the highest implied body count ever
so the werewolf was killed with moon power, isnt that contradictory?
Wrek agreed
Doctor of tardis?
haha doctor of tardis
xD
sir doctor of tardis. seems legit
Wrek: well yea, you are just murdering tons of dudes right?
Sir Doctor of TARDIS IS NOW CANON

and the doctor doesn't care
I got Queen Nefertiti as MY girlfriend!
I'm back! :)
queen victoria banished the doctor TO THE MOON
Next time there's a ROYAL WEDDING, we WON'T HELP YOU!
Mom's saying that the real Queen Victoria would never have done something like that.
she was a himiphile?
lol Dark92Enigma
i didn't know victoria was a himmiphile O_o
haemophilia is not a vampire disease?
BronyInstrumental: A what?
wb Joy
damn, i spelt it wrong
Wrek: have you played chrono trigger yet? if your answer is no, then stop what you are doing, download a SNES emulator, Chrono Trigger ROM and enjoy it
say no more say no more , hint hint
xD
the royal family had/has a strain of hemophilia
Back to the TARDIS.........
BRAVO!!!!!!!!
And the Daily Mail launches a thousand angry letters of protest
A nods as good as a wink to a blind bat!
isn't haemophilia like.... attraction to horses?
Oh wait, there's more
Bronysith, it's an RPG
Are you not mistaken, BronyInstrumental??
BronyInstrumental: hameo = blood
torchwood, lol
05Bronysith: not my kind of game
BronyInstrumental: don't look it up on Google..........HEY I'M WATCHING YOU!
understandable
hemophilia means that your blood doesn't clot.
foreshadowing
BronyInstrumental: I thought that was equiphilia
RPG are mostly good for their story
Foreshadowing!
also "call captain jack harkness!"
Wrek: understandable
a mystery. to google!
Torchwood Institute
Dat forshadowing
OMFW Tie-in
TORCHWOOD INSTITUTE

Bronysith: I had that for dinner :3

BronyInstrumental: True
whoosaah, whoosaaah
05JESmith71: nope
MLP_Brovakiin: im HAVING it for dinner tonight
Wrek, Who? what?
we must love and tolerate
05i banned him to shut you guys up
05casue you kept aknowladgign his existance
xD
*shrugs* I've been sitting here watching Dr. Who like a good colt. :)
:'9
EY everypony
I couldn't understand anytihng over this awesome Whoish going on
hi robotdragon9
Hello robotdragon9
Wrek: well I tried to be nice...
Wrek: there are different ways of fighting trolls, some dont involve banning the owners account
how are things robotdragon9
Hello robotdragon9
hi robotdragon9
Wrek: we're sorry
Bronysith: put gravy on it, it makes it 20% more tasty :D
I got too distracted from the IRC to pay attention.
Billie Piper(Rose) was actually at dragoncon...didnt bother seeing her
A chat of 137 people and not a single one reacting to a troll is a paradox
just came back from a 1yr old's birthday party
MLP_Brovakiin: im putting it with hot sauce
meh I need food... brb
5 pepper sauce to be exact
not all that exciting
Bronysith: Fair enough :)
OH SHIT, i just realized how to defeat a Nordic god!
Alchemist, oh come on a paradox is stretching
05do tell
Bronysith: steal their mead?
farewell
00,10and then she fliped her shit
CrimsonPhoenix: okay, its scientifically possible then, but not probable :)
:D
THE TARDIS
twilight_sprinkle: He only did it cause everyone was getting their horsefeathers all ruffled.
OHNO TARDIS
SUDDENLY DOCTOR
turdis
05what Klumzeedragon saud
Now i think this only applies to Skyrim Nords...but If it is true, then you just need to shoot a Nordic god once in the knee, then they give up on life
Klumzeedragon: almost nobody was, most people were just having fun with him
05also hai Swifty
who is sarah jane?
00,10I was so glad she got her own spin off show
So who's the chick?
it was fun annoying him :P
Dark_Horst old companion
hello @Wrek xD
Bronysith: :D
Bronysith....
Dark_Horst: Former companion. Very popular in the 1970s.
Sumica: RIP Elisabeth Sladen
Bronysith, you clever....clever girl
00,10She was a companion
Rex_Mundi: ... "wings slowly rise"
that doctor on the bottom right is doing nothing
Rose be a little jealous
Derpy is!
Allrighty im off again :P
Awkward
night
/me wings shoot up at sight of socks luna
Night MaxTheBrony
05tej
So tired -_-
like a little girl?
bye MaxTheBrony
This was the first time Rose realized that she was only the latest in a long line of companions
twilight_sprinkle: :) Wrek will probably unban the account in do time. Just did it long enough to get the troll off. It's not a big deal.
Bronysith: well least its not like SHED's version *remembers creepy veiny wings* 0_o
meeeeow
BladedWings: Moo
Who was banned again?
05twilight_sprinkle: actually many kept commenting on his attempts to annoy us. so i got rid of him untill the owner gets back and eitehr appeals and or timer rusn out
I very enjoyed this episode
Mickey tells it like it is
Wrek: from what i saw most people were just hugging him or counter-trolling, so nobody was getting angry or annoyed
05TheRandomkid321: someone used imjsutadeprers computer, probably a friend of his to troll us, so we temp banned him without placing any marks on him
00,10mickey has the right idea
But Im not going to keep answering for Wrek. He doesnt need to explain himself to us.
Anyway, much as I love this episode, I have to get going. Later, all.
05counter trolling is still trolling
That's it!I'm gonna be the doctor for hallloween :P
EPIC
05agaisnt the rules
Wrek Okay then. I could imagine my friend doing that.
No wonder the teachers are all batty
K-9
K9
Right, let's get off this trolling business. It's not helping anypony here.
Wrek: so even though its trolling to get rid of the troll without banning the owners account, its bad?
K-9 is best disco
05eeyup. it cloggs the chat with useless shit that could be spent talkign about the stream or arguign about who's best pony.
oh god...that sound
05besides
You guys see the new drawfriend? Dat #16
05tehre wotn be a permanent mark on his account for that ban
Is this Sarah Jane or Docter Who?
Yes, TheRandomkid321
Bronysith......you look just like how i imagined u would 0_o
Wrek talking about best pony is useless cause twilight is best pony
05Rex_Mundi: link me in PM please
God i love chips
Are there any for mine Wrek?
lol Wrek everypony knows theyre all equally best :)
05TheGreatAndPowerfulT: asskisser
haha
/me glomps TheGreatAndPowerfulT
Wrek :p nope i do like twilight as best pony
distraction http://derpy.me/aHw0Y
Wrek please please everyone knows RD is best pony :O
Trixie is just my favorite two totally diferent categories
if everyone is having fun counter-trolling the troll, i dont see anything wrong with it, as long as nobody is getting actually angry about it
Awkward
You know my step brother is a antoi-brony and once he asked me what was my nickname in the chat. I NEVER told him because I knew what he was going to do.
Wrek, just go to EqD, its the most recent post.
brb gonna get some food
Indeed, Alchemist o///o
I was having fun trolling :P
*anti
Bye, all.
Alchemist: wow neat cosplay
Wrek: im pretty sure im the ass kicker of the year

icly impossible for me to sleep right now.
Alchemist: She's adorkable. :D
So wait. Didn't they make a show about K-9 at one point in time?
they're doing SOMTHING to the children *if you know what I mean*
Rex_Mundi: lol dat celestia
and she's hungarian. I thought in hungary cosplay was non existant
I'm the tin-dog
mickey is best tin dog
Still better writing than the Prequels
Does absolutly NOONE notice the monster?
TheRandomkid321: Obviously not?
Irrefutable truth
TheRandomkid321: it is in the script
Wait..........is this.......the END¡? :'(

Dont most of the doctors partners end up dying?

Lyra`: O.o Well then...

it took me until 2 hours of playing later for my ammo and such to recover
it was a loud snot faced fat baby
so its okay.
robotdragon9: That's why we don't go to Ravenholm.
Klumzeedragon exactly
:P

BURN BABY BURN
I love it when it puts a bit of comedic relief
Roger, roger

VenHur: Good. Watching Dr. Who. :) And how are you?
K9 NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Good...good...
Don't say goodbye K9 :'(
they should bring back the doctors daughter in the new season
Alchemist that plug sustained like 100 computers at once
:'(
;-;
DERP
NNNNOOOOOO!!!!!! :'(
Dark92Enigma: No quoting the droids!
:'(
Alchemist I wonder why it hasn't exploded before
i just realized....its the 1yr anniversary of being a brony (well by the month)
K9 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! :'(
First Ballsack, then Scrotum........NOW K9! :'(
ekips: so? still doesnt explain why it explodes when the plug gets unplugged.
its been a great year
You
bad
dog
K9 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! :'(
AFFIRMATIVE
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Noooo! K-9!!
schools out for ever
Alchemist changing and unstable running system always gives strange/unexpected results
So....who's gonna pay for the rebuilding of that school?
lol
oh man, the Techno-Dog is dead?
Cliche #123 : Kid saying YES
that's a shame
irl he would be in jail all of em

PillowPoni: ummmm...doctor has an I.O.U.
Buytoast, eeyup. He was from before the revival
nobody, PillowPoni, in england blowing up schools happens in every school at least once, and then no one cares anymore :)
ekips: the most I can think of is the high voltage making an arc, but no explosion
thank god the Dark Souls music is over
we have lost a robotic dog today :(
BronyInstrumental: Oh..kay.....
poor doggy :'(
sumica, ive been out of the loop, who is that greenish pony on the left?

Hey Everypony :D
XD
Polydunami: kay
hi
http://askprincessmolestia.tumblr.com/image/26642500176
I keep wanting to say Hipster-BRONY but that's somepony else.
The Starship Troopers would be fucked if they fought these bugs :D
LOL
Bronysith: :D
Major: Caesars legion could take them no problem
Polydunami: O_O there's a hipster-brony?
And suddenly the USS Enterprise drops out of warp right on top of the protoss base.
Hipster-Pony: Yep!
tSparkx: OH LOL
Well, there WAS. I don't know where he got to, though :S
Rex_Mundi: yeah no, if they cant stop ONE person they cant stop anyone
Polydunami: :( aw.
Major: The curior doesnt count
it would be nice to meet him
Rex_Mundi: i easily took down the legion
Hipster-Pony: Pro-tip: (my name is tSparx, but that's nbd), if you want to be sure to always type in a name correctly, start typing a name (tS) and then press tab and it'll fill out the name for you (tSparx) :)
Bronysith: On easy or normal, i only play on very hard with hardcore mode.
Rex_Mundi: then who would that leave? The NCR?
it's buffering for me
Rex_Mundi: and "inherited" caesars throne
Rex_Mundi: hardcore very hard of course
im no newb
Well, Hipster-Pony, Hipster Brony is one of the bronystate founders.
We watchin someone play live or is this some video?
(tSparkx) :P like that?
Hey Everypony :D
Hipster-Pony: Polydunami So he picked a good name!
STAMPEDE!!
:3
6_9 wow so many pings
Hipster-Pony: No no, like this: type out "tS" (without the quotes) and then press tab :)
How's it going? :)
tSparx:
XD oh
Hipster-Pony: Huzzah! :D
:)
YAY :D
So help me out, because as I said, I'm not familiar with SCII at all -- is he winning or losing at this point, or is it too early to say?
Oh yeah - it said i needed a new one. I think my internet, chat and laptop are all well and truly Derped...
Sorry to keep troubling you all! :S
Yeah, sometimes your internet cuts out and it keeps your username logged in.
the video is buffering for me
Yeah, that's what happened, exceot it told me to change it, so i used my OC's Full name :P
mfw Hipster-Pony... reminds me too much of HB
^^'
Aww! Thanks :')
Would i be able to play with people as a F2P Star craft 2?
brb guys, gotta go start the grill
So, tell me - what occurs here at BronyState?
everything
Streams and chat.
And movies on Friday!
alexxm: damn you and your faster response!
Oh and there's plenty else
Nah, I'm fine with this one - it's pretty much the same anyway. Thanks for the advice though tsparx :)
and, come season 3, we stream pony episodes at the time of their release
Oh wow! That's awesome ^3^
You might've seen a video on the youtubes about the internet chat reaction to Derpy speaking in that episode.
Bronystate is awesome
That was this very website.
I think that the fact that they found Derpy's voice offensive, is offensive..,
until then, we have Brony Movie Night at 7pm EST on Friday, a Euro Movie Night at 2 pm EST on Saturday, a new Podcast which is undergoing a rescheduled time change (should be sometime on Saturday), and much more
I find your offense... offensing.
Sorry about the sudden nick-changing, have to do one more fiddling with /ns
This is so cool!!
i will never show my friends this website
No problem :)
:)
Nor shall I!
Well, it's not bothering anyone on the chat embed, tSparx
they'll start caps locking everypony
Or me
:P
I'm back!
Hi Joy!
00,10they would not last long then
Hey Joy!
^
Polydunami: Ah, well sometimes it bugs the mods, and anyone on a third-party client, so I understand.
so many photon cannons
:)
Welcome back Joy :)
Polydunami: I did not end that sentence right: so I usually try to avoid spamming /nick changes xD
wb Joy
wut
is the video buffering for anyone else?
Just wait until the new episodes get streamed, tSparx; people are joining and leaving RAPIDLY and we get to see EVERY SINGLE JOIN AND QUIT.
or frozed?
:D
Hipster-Pony: Try clicking the "refresh" button right below the stream.
wut is that nub zerg player doing!?!?
tSparx: ok
00,10all them cannons and but only a couple power supplys
nothing changed
btw, to the new people, i would recommend reading the chat rules
Polydunami: Don't they usually change the chan-mode to +(whatever it is that doesn't show leave/joins even to third-party clients)
I wish ads would stop asking me if I liked busty women...
