Hello.
Thanks, NewSuperBronyU! :)
oh thx NewSuperBronyU
The sight of a Youtube button on a widely used platform such as X-Box Live. It just demonstrates that Youtube has become a point of internet centralization and has thus become a detriment to the true value of the internet.
Thanks NewSuperBronyU

G'night everypony! :)

Why Does Everyone Get So Uptight About The /me Stuff?
So........how about that airline food?
yeah..
Laurayne: Sometimes it gets a bit excessive.
Its Not Like Its Hurting Anything, Is It...?
we haven't had a lot of activity lately, its been slow..
We've had cases before where people kept spamming it.
Laurayne: its against the rules
Slllloooowwww!
It got annoying to people who just wanted to chat.
I See...
yeah usually I'm here haha, I just don't always talk
Dovah: It's not against the rules, it's just against the rules if you spam it.
Hmmm...
Thought no rp
No. RP's okay, just not too much at one time.
pony pony pony pony pony
What If I Find Us A Place Where Ponies Can RP...?
thats because your in school
I wonder how many people have actually seen the thread I posted
I'd stay here
Laurayne: There are channels for RP, you just have to find them that's al.
There are rooms on the ponychat network for that.
Really?
*all
Laurayne: Yep.
im back :)
Welcome back, cachi01! :)
You can type /list to see all available channels.
Im Not Into Exessive RP, But It Might Be A Fun Place... I Like It Here Though
yay my morphsuit arrives in 2 weeks!
cachi01: Morph.......suit?
Costume?
Laurayne: Glad you do. :)
morphsuit!
From the Metroid series? :S
She said she's gonna come check it out when she can
http://www.morphsuits.com/white-original-morphsuit
Im Waiting For Crystaline_Shard (Spelling) To Return... ^_^ We Became Goo Friends Yesturday
AJIsAwesome: lol no
OH.
Good*
I see now. :D
morphsuit! cause i need it for halloween to scare the shit out of people!
Laurayne: RP is fine, but too much is annoying :P
What MadSurge said. :)
everypony is afraid of Le Slenderman
Not me. :S
Get a Suit for that Morphsuit cachi01
Never found him scary.
thelonepony: thats what im searching right now lol
AJIsAwesome: watch marble hornets
ALL OF IT
I find Slenderman to be someone who'd be pretty chill with
OMG That Would Be Awesome!
Meh. No thanks.
what a abotu Mexiacan Slederman?
AJIsAwesome: u scared? :3
About*
Slenderman Costume >:3
AJIsAwesome: I find him creepy, but not too much :D
cachi01: No...just not into Marble Hornets.
It's not my thing.
a creature that eats your organs, empiles your body in a tree and makes you have a very strong disease is pretty scary to me
Why Does Mr Slendy Wear A Suit Anyway...?
Laurayne: who says you cant be scary with style!
You don't see him but he sees you
cachi01: How can it give you a strong disease if you already eats your organs and impales you on a tree? :S
Was He On His Way To Work And Though "Oh, Im Just Gonna Go Have A Quick Bite Of That Kid's Soul Real Quick..." lol
cachi01: he just wants his 20$ :3
*it already
AJIsAwesome: before he does that. he releases some kind of toxins that make you cough blood, strong headaches and sometimes amnesia
MadSurge: lol
Though the tentacles would be a little weird.
Can We Stop Talking About The Organs And Blood And Stuff Please....
^
but slendy
he'd be a big hit in japan :D
night guys
Yeah, we should cool it.
NIght, alexxm :)
nite alexxm

taoumi why would I do that? I like my moustache . . .
xD
ASoftFluffyThing: thats because you are not a japanese schoolgirl

I used to have a computer I left on IRC 24/7... I didn't talk much, even when I was near the computer though. XD

Dken2021: How? :D
AJIsAwesome, there's not enough friday and night

My Cinema Around Here Is The Only Place I Know Of That Has An Actual Arcade Anymore :(
cachi01: I'll enjoy tentacles when they're in my stomach. And when I say that, I mean after they've been in some kind of stir fry with white rice and veggies
The cinemas around me have overpriced food.
cachi01 Oh! Oh! I got something from Omegle.
http://logs.omegle.com/e0abd90

Thats why I eat a big meal and not purchase anything there.

Cypresswolf: Some of the toons from that era had good music in the intros. http://youtu.be/EuqO9P1Ixm4
PeachStreak: It's nice.
BRB
Kinixys: Stream's on, I think.
NOt sure.

weeping_pegasi82: What do you mean?
AJIsAwesome: thank you also if ya look carefully you can see the detail
Refrash. Hehe.
What;s this?
alright, just remember not to complain about the stream and whatnot
AJIsAwesome: nevermind
*What's
This is Duke Nukem.
weeping_pegasi82: Oh, the complimenting?
Kinixys: I never saw Visionaries - I dont think that show survived into the 90's
is it just me or does the stream pause every few secounds then resume?
I have lag too
Not just you, lag's survived the embed swap
same here
AJIsAwesome: eeyup
Yes, but we shouldn't complain.
music is fine, but video is choppy
tue AJIsAwesome
We should be lucky we're getting a stream.
not much we can do atm
true AJIsAwesome
ah hey Duke Nukem BALLS OF STEEL :D
If you don't complain things don't get fixed.
I weep for the society that takes complaints as a bad thing.
Who's streaming?
Wrek...get some massive video skips...if tho already didnt know
Amelia Wrek
and if complain too much then we get nothing
YOU LOSE!
GOOD DAY SIR!

LadyCanary: hello there
In a glorious mood.
'Lo FlutterMEDIC.
FlutterMEDIC: hello there

hi FlutterMEDIC :)
LadyCanary: The best mood of them all.
Chrysalis goes Numnumnumnum http://cheezburger.com/6295450368
brb supper
Thing is it looks like the lag is only on the game screen, his facecam doesn't seem to be lagging at all.
odd
he isn't moving much though
He shot the sexi ladi.
yeah, his facecam doesn't lag
hes in the "zone"
just the game
Maybe it's the screencapper.
FlutterMEDIC: Ah, that's adurrable.
what kind of jacket would you call Connor's in AC3? a confederate jacket like re-enactments?
ermaferd is dat some duke nukem 3D
Wreky, game's lagging a bit. Face cam is fine, but yeah.
btw, who's streaming?
Wreky is
FlutterMEDIC wrek
:)
HIYA everypony
hey Bronysith
Wrek it's just the game that's lagging. Your facecam and sound are perfect
hi Bronysith
Hi Bronysith.
Hi, Bronysith! :)
hi Bronysith
still laggy as hell
mmm
Lag indures. At least for me, anyone else?
^
Yes.
Hi, BronySith.
But face cam is fine.
hello LadyCanary
and sounds
Aye. facecam and audio are fine but the game video is scrambled.
maybe its the game window being large thats causing lag?
hello Amelia
since it's Duke Nukem, whats your guys opinion of Duke Nukem Forever?
:)
Shouldn't be that. We've had more graphically intense games played fullscreen before.
FlutterMEDIC: sucks
FlutterMEDIC i enjoyed it
FlutterMEDIC despite what people say about it, I wouldn't mind playing it
good...but not in todays standards unfortunetey
It's pretty laggy
FlutterMEDIC: BOO! IT WAS BLA!
I got it for 3 bucks, but I haven't bothered to play it.
Er, the stream now is laggy
it was far better than most modern shooters
references were awesome, but it just overall sucked
O_O
GEARS
Of pain
FlutterMEDIC haven't played it, but according to reviews and shit, it sucked
like Meanwhile said Wrek the sound and your facecam are fine just the game is choppy
:0
Oh, I see. BladedWings|HW is right
What made Duke Nuke 3D and Blood so good were the level designs. 3Drealms really lost sight of that.
Or so I've read.
Wrek that's even worse
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: 16 Month Coloring Calendar
you know what i say about the lag? FUCKING WINDOWS 98
Kinixys well they had 12 years to do it, and it was juggled between companies
HOW IT IS 16 MONTH?
AAAAGGGHHHH OOOOOOOHHHHHH
NENUDJUS easy, add 4 years of the next year
Wrek that's alot better
Dken2021: 4 years= 4 months?!
...Mission Impossible? XD
LadyCanary IKR?
Yeah seeing some improvement.
time for NGE episode 10
erm...yea...that
yea, getting better
omg breaking news 2013 is going to have 16 months!
um
dufuq
no
how?
That doesn't even make sense.
since its just one giant map, the entities must be lagging the SHIT out of the stream
Groovy.
awww
:)
This leads...to the close button.

Minecraft will eat your day.
Then your week.

Meanwhile, hasn't ate mine
Then before you know it you look in the mirror and there's an old man looking back at you.

Bronystate ate my life instead
And you have to ask yourself.
WAS IT WORTH IIIIIIIIT?

08,01i've been hearing about this springer video
08,01what's so bad about it?
08,01i've not watched it yet
Not much really.
and it's obvious
Wheeeeeeeeeeeee
It's so ludicrous
horrible cosplay
They hired actors for the actual episode, they fail quite badly.
not so horrible comments
Apparently they weren't actors.
the stairway to heaven and a highway to hell
08,01Lunar_Brony: really? how can you tell?
I think they were actors
...Dari, LIES.
Hey guys I'm back. What's going on?
Paid actors
it was so bad.
they had to be actors.
Only bad research could lead to something like that
ASoftFluffyThing: wrek be playin minecraft
Well the guy who was on the show was apparently on reddit
Hai everypony
He posted his old blog
hi Derpy_Hooves
dammit
hi DerpyMuffins
ASoftFluffyThing: well now he is wait for sumica ^_^
As evidence
they had to be actors it was so bad.
Wrek: DO IT
That's a friend of his apparently
OH MY GOD
They went together
iots SO CLEAR
its*
A mistake no brony could ever commit
Derpy_Hooves! Hiya
dari: You mean like that one PR guy on facebook from the Chick-fil-a crap a while ago?
hi everyone i come to you all from a brand new, out of the factory, $970.00 laptop
maybe...maybe the woman was cosplaying as her ponysona?
also heh proving something over the internet
genius
Dken2021: She said she was Rainbow Dash.
:)
I thought she was cosplaying rarity?
08,01well, that doesn't seem too bad
This is the supposed proof
Dken2021: she said she was rainbow dash.
That lady looked like a hobo they pulled off a barge.
08,01there are worse things that she could have done
I dont think she knew what she was cosplaying.
08,01like cosplayed as her black and red alicorn OC
oh gawd
that...is proof?
Interests: "Smoking crack and worshipping Satan"
Sounds legit.
yeah not buying it
Archbrony> What?
noones placed a bid on that atari jacket yet..
Well the facebook account predates the filming
XD
...GODDAMMIT NO.

08,01Meanwhile: and that was a double negative, so clearly i am

hi Vash
Hi, Vash. :)
Well Saturday's are going to be fun once Season 3 begins. Hour of ponies then TMNT
Hiya Vash what's going on?
i'm guessing singleplaer
J_E_Smith71: Nice. :)
cachio01 ever think about how weird it is that you just wake up in a world (in minecraft) and just punching trees?
I mean it makes sence, but still
Wrek's a lumberjack and that's okay.
Dat logic.
Wrek has spoken. It is so.
whos hosting?
Wrek: what show again?
superretroworld Wrek
Yar ;3
cool
I could tell they were fake from the start. :D
Wrek is streaming, that is
ooo... Tekkit
You're right she wasn't a brony, but the guy could've been. I understand some people trying to defend that fact, but it's soooo stupid to attempt to defend that show for anything. xD
so we got Raging Raven, Crying Wolf Screaming mantis.....
^^
?I mean it makes sence, but still
oops, prfssed up aRROW
Raging raven I'm thinking Fluttershy
Dark_Horst: Eeyup.
not sure though....
*wolf
Anyone have a link to the entire brony clip?
well, duh. she said she's rainbow dash. with a horn.
Kinixys: I'll look for you. :3
A HORRRRRNN
Dark_Horst: IKR? :D
you cant fake in more obviously
Wall get.
Kinixys well video links are not permitted during stream
Vash: We can send in PM's. It's fine. :3
PMs vash.
lolwut xDDD https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/18/Knnr6Eo8N0mmByA312-0aA2.gif
gotcha gotcha
Kinixys: there was no episode to just bronies, it was that little bit. The show was on guilty pleasures.
Ah
DAT DOMO SKIN :D
Is it a good idea to play Minecraft with the touchpad mouse of a laptop?
ASoftFluffyThing: I did. It's fine.
ASoftFluffyThing: yes
cachi01: Yup, clearing confusion. Lol.
ASoftFluffyThing: it may work, it works for me in tf2
RD with a horn.......lets kill him
cachi01, AJIsAwesome: Okay. Because I tried TF2 with the laptop mouse. Never again.
cachi01: *her
SO HIM
my first minecraft house was a 2x2x3 hole in the ground
ASoftFluffyThing: Okay. Thanks for the TF2 bit. :)
superretroworld: how well does it work for you when you use a laptop mouse pad?
BladedWings|HW: MC or tf2?
This music is making it very ominous.
and suddenly dramatic music
Wrek, your music is timed perfectly
superretroworld: ummm both
I like the dramatic music when night hit and urgency to building a house was heightened. :3
Mass Effect 2, the Collector's theme.
^^
DOMO
Watch out for Creepers, Wrek
Anyone seen the Doctor Who episode called "BlinK"?
That's pretty expensive.
ASoftFluffyThing: He just has to worry about spiders, his walls are high enough.
AND now it's raining.
Amelia: dont blink
Amelia: That's not... The angels one is it?
or else
Have you noticed, that on top of everything it's raining?!
Amelia, don't spoil for those interest in the series
and that was a brilliant episode
Zuxxez123, won't creepers blow up your house even if they don't see you?
Sorry.
BladedWings|HW: havent played MC on pc, i just said it may work, but tf2 i find easier with the touch cause you dont need to keep moving the mouse all the time
Amelia: It's okay. :)
Blink, the first episode with Weeping Angels. Before Weeping Angels phoned it in and jumped the shark.
Ok guys, bed time. Goodnight :)
ASoftFluffyThing: Only explode when they get near a human controlled player.
ASoftFluffyThing: they only blow up if they are close to you
Night Mad- dammit...
"Wrek builds a house in Minecraft while fitting music plays"
Night, Mad- :(
nite madsu...awww
Ssssssssss
Zuxxez123, Dark_Horst okaay then
It's okay AJIsAwesome.... We will get through this. :3
Don't blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good Luck
Zuxxez123: Yes we will. :D
>3<
cachi01: Oh the angel things?
ASoftFluffyThing: At his point in the building; worse is spiders climbing up the walls into the house. Or maybe even a monster spawning on top of the trees. But Spiders are more likely out of the two.
funfact: notch's favorite pony is rainbow dash
Zuxxez123, reasonable.
cachi01 FUCK YEAH!!
Easy to block spiders, unless they've changed things.
woah...
Attack of the...shrub.
Did they get rid of the Endermen's ability to pick up blocks?
Ponymatic: He hasn't finished his house yet, isn't going to use bricks to block off spiders right now.
AJIsAwesome they didn't . . .
FLOATING TREASURE
Only avaible on tv
AJIsAwesome: I think they have, yes.
call now and you'll get
Just make an overhang, they can't move upside down. :)
a FREE OVEN
It FLOATS
Aw, man. That was the one thing I liked about them. That's what made them unique to me.
CrimsonPhoenix: BUTCHA GOTTA CALL NAO
for only 29.99
Oh yes. They ALL FLOAT
I was randomly kicked from the server, maybe PC is still screwy...
CrimsonPhoenix :D dat "It"
They aaaalll float down here.
(in 100 payments)
/me offers around balloons.
Oh god, IT for B-Movie.
^
^^
i wish someone could invent a portable floating furnace
aint nobody got time for that?
Spiders, an evil legion of spiders!
It? THAT It?
/me has never seen IT
I like that film.
Stephen*
IT FOR B MOVIE?
Stephen, pardon me.
ASoftFluffyThing: You should. It's a laugh. :D
The movie was eh...
LadyCanary NO. I'm already downing enough Fresca with the Pony Drinking Game. I don't need the Stephen King one too!
OH GOD O_O
:33333
How have you not seen IT? It's the perfect B movie!
we went from infomercial to B-Movie
Better than most Stephen King movie conversions though.
how have we done that?
The book's better, obviously, but the movie's quite fun.
Lunar_Brony: /) We can get through it, there isn't enough Jack to stop us get through it! :3
it? wasnt it that yu gi oh epsiode/movie thingie?
CrimsonPhoenix: Balloons and floating.
Ponymatic: Um, Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, The Green Mile.
the book is the one with the turtle right?
AJIsAwesome, I like Balloons
Zuxxez123 true /)
but not Balloons party
OH GOD THE GREEN MILE <3
CrimsonPhoenix: Don't we all. :D
Dark_Horst: It still is. We are talking for later on, the next movie night.
too much harsh songs
Oh shit pomme frit.
okay then
I for one enjoy something smooth and relaxing
btw, is it really as bad as people say?
How are people able to make awesome houses before nightfall but when I try all I have are two blocks stacked
LadyCanary: Heh, Tommyknockers
CrimsonPhoenix: Some I like, some I don't. I think it's a good (not great) album.
Dark_Horst: yes its bad
Dark_Horst: I think most people say it's bad because of the Nostalgia Critic reviewing it, but I think it is bad, in a good way, always though so.
when it gotdrawn last week the mods where debating to redraw
AJIsAwesome, oh yeah I HATE screamo metal
that's just....urgh
ASoftFluffyThing: i just build a pillar or in a cave on the first night
Zuxxez123: didnt knew NC reviewed it
and they dared fooled me with some sweet sound at first
cachi01: You didn't? :D
IT isn't this week's B movie, we just want it voted in at some point.
That's how I heard of it. :D
AJIsAwesome: nope lol
cachi01: How did you not know that? Lol.
like it goes la~ lala~ la~
This week's B is Yu-Gi-Oh Pyramid of Light. Or something.
and then ARGHGHGHGISDNVSINVODSFNGBOFDS
^
yeah not my style
Zuxxez123: not a big fan of NC lol
cachi01: You don't have to be.
AJIsAwesome: my mother read a LOT of stephen king and watched the movies, that's how I devolped a fear of bad acting. :3
cachi01: That's fair. :P
look at all dem apple guts flying out
Zuxxez123: Okay. :D
Meanwhile: oh phew
That apple was two days from retirement! :(
I admit, I'm afraid of going in the caves by myself.
Not cool for someone who enjoys MC
oh yeah and apparently the title Balloon Party isn't even original
whatw as that striped thing?
you know what would be cool for halloween? marble hornets marathon!!!
since there was an album named Knife Party before
CrimsonPhoenix: It's supposed to be based off Pinkie's love for parties. That's why.
that was also electro
but enough of shitty music
let's enjoy Wrek cutting leaves
CrimsonPhoenix: probably a homage, with the knife shape on the cover and all
only ballon party songs i like are loco and This monster in me
cause you can never have enough leaves
IRC client crashed. XD
I actually like a lot of the songs. Some I don't.
What purpose do the leaves serve? Like....
Dark_Horst, he wanted to make a sequel
fbgfjzkbfjk bngfk.b
can you guess the title?
ASoftFluffyThing: drop seeds
I don't mind a sequel. :S
aww
sequel of what exactly?
Balloon Party.
cachi01, besides that.
after party is already out
of balloon party
a long time
I want a turquoise balloon :3
Flutterrage something
you can go download it
can't remember
Flutterrage Valley
Yeah
oh
I forgot what the next one is for
BP was for BronyCon, After Party was for EFNW
also a name almost taken from that same group that did Knife party
wasnt after party the sequel to balloon party though?
I thing FV is for another con?
:D minecraft im playing that on xbox360
Dark_Horst: Yeah. It was for those who didn't make Balloon Party
It's going to be amusing when he gets attacked by something.
so yeah
ORIGINALITY
WOOOOO
So, how about that airline food?
CrimsonPhoenix: just liusten to Loco and this monster in me by pinkie guy
listen*
cachi01, I won't stand it
trust me
CrimsonPhoenix: its not techno :3
you do not want me to listen to it
it's screamo metal
I've comment on that before
yeah it is :I
and about Techno
I LOVE Daft Punk
not screamo. but death metal
Hey guys
I'm getting so much lag
Hey Freefall29
I liek metals :3
Hi, Freefall29 :)

Stupid chat

No lag on my end. Try refreshing.
Hiya there Freefall29 how's life treating you?
Daft Punk is cool
I'm thinking of doing a little experiment
the prodigy > daft punk IMO
Death is best metal band :3333
love me some daft punk
^
I also love MCMcGuy
Zuxxez123: life's been normal. pretty cool so far. schools hard but that's typical
I might start giving people +v to the most active ones here
or rather
i like the prodigy too
MCAverageguy

AJIsAwesome:cause dubstep are wubs.....
I guess that means I need to babble my head off to earn myself a +v. XP
or MCknowstoomanyfactsaboutbees
cachi01: Not all dubstep is wubs.... :S
All wubstep is dubs.
Game menus in the block land!
cachi01: Dubstep varies in a LOT of stuff.
^
Wreky looks sleepy.
Nah
:P
Dubstep all sounds like a blown speaker to me.
I definitely love MCCanadianStereotype
Because I'm OLD.\
and then there's dubstep that isnt even dubstep
That guy man
Frankly I don't like any music than can be accurately recreated by putting a 90's modem in a blender.
is genius
i've listened to some dubstep songs and they all sound the same for me :I
DocSane: DARN KIDS TODAY! *waves cane*
08,01folkstep
Basicly its just the most active people here
cachi01: yeah, most are like that, but some I actualyl like.
there is such a thing as folkstep?
Like I said, don't like all forms of dubstep, only some.
Meanwhile, but 90s modems make awesome music on their own
* I don't like
But nothing can beat the Beatles in my eyes. :3
i like some the 80s rock and metal
good dubstep is hard to find

Meanwhile: Dat stache ;D
hey Wrek, did you see the comment i made about me getting my Fluttershy Plushie?
Still no stream for me..........

ASoftFluffyThing: I've had plenty of exposure to moustaches. :D
>Took long enough
What are the system requirements for PS2?
>Takes longer
NENUDJUS, sometimes if you request, you can ask the streamer if you can post a link.
AJIsAwesome|Busy, then you're not doing it right

Meanwhile That's because you never played the other gens.
LadyCanary: it just annoys me how everyone is happy to see someone banned and proceeds to praise the banhammer.
Kandarihu: Honestly, I don't like either of the candidates. I think no matter who we pick, we lose.
It's yer own fault.
ZELDA IS A GIRL GODDAMIT ZELDA IS NOT LINK FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

:kickbot please say Error: Must be OP
twilight_sprinkle: It's funny. And they arent sucking up to it. They are praising the banhammer for glorious troll banning. And the reason why I said "oh it turns me on when you do that" is because Im just joking around.

oh bai Everlasting_Joy
Kandarihu: Keep in mind I am no fan of Obama, who pushed policies like the expansion of the Patriot Act and the signing of ACTA (which was against his stated policy). And yet I still don't like Romney, who can't decide what he wants to do. He's changed his policies several times now, and that strikes me as blatant pandering.
bye Everlasting_Joy
Y'all just fucked up now, Connor.

That's a very strange statement.
LadyCanary He is not capable of such a feat.

Meanwhile: Ooooooooooooooooh Now you FUCKED UP!
twilight_sprinkle: Not from what I've seen.
/me attempts to look cute. Looks like a squid.
LadyCanary: its Always what i see
People just generally joke around about it.
that's an alright wallpaper
Meanwhile: I like squids :3333333

Besides, I won't be taking any lip from a guy whose name is Ashley.

Kandarihu: Obama's essentially ignoring the question here. This all sounds nice but he hasn't answered the question of "trickle down".
:kickbot Dark92Enigma my kick count. that is more than 2 parameters for sure
I don't know Ashley, I don't recall you ever saying to not call you Ashley so it's entirely possible that I called you something you didn't want to be called. Ashley.

Hearing a lot of complaints due to one team having over half the server cap of players.
Oh, and Kandarihu: I'm inclined to think the "I like coal" bit is a nod to Ohio voters, where coal is starting to rise a bit in the eastern regions. Thoughts?
Dat motion blur
my lecturer is mad to the class now, good thing i finished my assignments today i dont get the blame and i could hang out here :3
i lol'd about Wrek unsuccessfully kicking me
for 5 minutes
http://www.the-top-tens.com/lists/worst-types-people.asp are we that bad?
Obama said before the 2008 election that he's going to bankrupt the coal industry, making it financially impossible to run a coalfired power plant or start one financially impossible. He's doing that via the EPA
superretroworld: As Jessica Rabbit said once: ''I'm not bad, i've been drawn this way'' so we are
IIRC*
Ah, there's the interrupting finally starting.
superretroworld: they hate us because they cant be us
>Bronies at #1
Romney needs to lower his tone a bit, he looks like he's starting to get angry.
>Murderers at #3
WUT
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I know what bullshit
And that's bad, he wants to get Obama off his game, not vice versa.
Blame society and them Politic parties............LAME!
Dovah: i do feel bad for ppl that want to like the show but dont have a feel for it
Question: Let's say your going to a new school and you really don't know anybody there so you have no friends and such. Would it be a good idea to wear a pony shirt to school only on the 5th week of school?
Dan Vs. Society
Ponies47, thats like me
inb4 grief lock
Ponies47, if you want to.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: A Murderer is far worse. what the hell were they thinking1?
!?*
Ponies47: id say no
Ponies47: but on the other hand, i dont think you should be caring about others' opinion anyway
Ponies47: Give it a couple weeks, see how the school society is there, and then consider it if it's good.
You know, we do kind of have a bit of an ego problem.
Ponies47: at least on this matter
Kandarihu: SOme of us.
Ponies47: that's how I felt when I went to my new school
Not me.
Ponies47 . . . depends. I wore a brony shirt and found out there are over a dozen in my school. The only reason I didn't know this before, however, is because the dozen bronies that I found out existed are starting their first high school year.
Dark92Enigma: Well when I think of it I guess I do kill people...
Dat Aliens referance.
Kandarihu: everyone has an ego problem nowadays. thats the core problem of society imo
but I'm on my 3rd year, so . . . yeah
er, thats what TigerDirect is for
Kandarihu: Both of them do. The big deal will be who lets theirs get in the way first, and right now Romney is starting to slip a bit. He needs to rein it in, because he's making the better case right now and doesn't want to lose it by virtue of getting angry.
brb for a while
Tiberium126: true. but then again, it's society who's on us
CK|Ded, my ego comment was on the top 10 most hated groups debate.
yo Ponies47 can you do me a favor and acept my request on steam? :)
hi everypony
AND the guy who made this survey
Hi, dynamo2814 :)
hello dynamo2814
hoi dynamo2814
Kandarihu: It's true of our candidates too. :P
Hi dynamo2814 :)
ohai dynamo2814
hi dynamo2814!
btw dynamo2814 , is your name after a football club?
CK|Ded, I guess so
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Good idea. I had this evil plan in mind to wear a ton of pony stuff to school on the last day >:3
also inb4 Trump retorts on Twitter
whenever somebody says 'ohai' do you think of tommy wiseau?
sonicdude558: I'm not online on Steam right now
ok, I see
Ponies47: school just started tho....
no, i was thinking of metroid prime and green lantern when i made it :)
superretroworld: eeyup
Ponies47: :D But don't go overboard if you do. Act within the bounderies of the society there.
dynamo2814: ah ok lol
Dark92Enigma: When people pay me out about liking MLP I just think 'Will This Matter In A years Time'?
Dovah: I'm on week 5 already.
I gotta say, Romney looks way more on his game today than Obama does.
i'm not a big sports fan haha
me neither
Ponies47: yeah month 2 of 9
Tiberium126: only time will tell, because i haven't reached my 1 year anniversary
well except tennis
I have NO bronies at my school :(
causetennisisbestsport
^
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah keep it simple like just shirt and sweatshirt or somthing
ninjad
Just keep in mind that this November, we're voting for a President, not a king. We're also voting for a Senator and a Representative and some local people as well.
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349302388210.jpg
Ponies47: Yep. Pretty much. :)
i have one as far as i know, hes in my art class
sonicdude558: Indeed I am the same :'(
damn it Wrek.
Flipped the transport.
You had one job!
That's quite impressive in it's own way.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah
damn chat derp...
Kandarihu: Obama just threw in the towel on that topic. Romney's firmly in charge of this debate.
Dovah: Don't remind me about all the time we still have left in school ._.
The good news is the surgery was a success and you look like a movie star.
i had 2 fellow bronies at college but nopony else
The bad news that movie star is Drew Carey.
LOL ---> 4chan <--- LOL
sup everypony?
I just found mostly wannabe bronies
Kandarihu: Also I should have made a drinking game out of this debate, darnit
Hi, RDash5000 :)
/me reminds Ponies47 about all the time left in school.
RDash5000: G'day
i'm more like a hidden brony
Hi RDash5000 :)
g'day Tiberium126
sup AJIsAwesome|Busy
bye Wrek
what do you mean wannabe bronies you either are or are not
hey thelonepony
Dark92Enigma: same
o/
i don't let it slide, but here in the chat, i let myself loose
game?
/me hugs Dark92Enigma
dynamo2814, they are people who PRETEND to be bronies
Just like Michael Keaton as Batman, THE REST COULD NEVER SUSPECT I AM A BRONY
wrek went afk? :p
dynamo2814: There are some poeple who pretend to get popularity.
Kandarihu: Though Romney needs to be careful how much he shrugs off the moderator, that will start to irritate voters as he'll seem somewhat arrogant. Otherwise he's definitely in the lead.
*people
that would actually kinda piss me off
/me Doesn't care if people know he's a brony
^
sonicdude558, you mean like bronies that doesn't even watch the shows?
/me respects Ponies47 for that
yeah
Like Touhou fags?
CK|Ded, are you seeing an opinion meter with the debate?
So, just got back, did I miss anything?
cause funfact
AdamTheDuck: Just chatting.
Though my mom approves of the bronies, she doesn't know I AM ONE. Go figure
most touhou fans haven't even played the games
like "Omg I watch it... Theres this Green and blue one..." Like that
I have 5 pony shirts a Scootaloo hat and a brony wristband :p
Kandarihu: Nope, watching the livestream
dark92enigma thats awkward
Ponies47: Where did you get the hat? :D
Dark92Enigma, :)
CK|Ded, okay
I have a goddamn Luna Hoodie
Kandarihu: Just judging from what I'm hearing.
say Ponies47 have you metup with thinker?
your argument is invalid
CK|Ded, ah
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Canterlot Gardens. $35. Worth every penny :P
can i post a pic
CrimsonPhoenix: Opinions. :P
dynamo2814: i'm still under the masquerade, like Batman
I only have 2 pony shirts, a poster from Canterlot Gardens, and my badges from there also
Ponies47: NIce.
i saw someone in my school with a dj-pon3 t-shirt in school. gave him a high five
twilight_sprinkle, thinker?
dynamo2814: and that's awesome
Romney. XD
CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, a guy from here
This game looks like fun
good thinking RDash5000
ooooh
twilight_sprinkle: Quick_Thinker? yes We did meet up. We said hi and talked for about a minute :P
Okay, that made me laugh. "I'm sorry Jim, I'll cut the money to PBS. I like PBS, I love Big Bird!"
dynamo2814: As long as it's appropraite.
Ponies47: ok, cause i havent seen him online since then
ok
*appropriate
Ponies47: since like a week ago mean
Er, three years, Romney.
This chatroom is more fun than the stream itself. No offence Wrek
that kill took waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long
The first one he contributed only about 20% of the overall debt. >_>
CK|Ded: PBS as a whole (including PBS kids)?
lol
He should've did it in 10 SECONDS FLAT :D
http://www.welovefine.com/1280-wub-you-awesome.html i want this jacket really bad
My favorite pony shirt I ahve right now. My Ponybots one. I wanted that one for so logn and know i ahve it :3
I hate how they removed the Twilight Sparkle hoodie with the mane and the horn on it
Well, more money that parents of young children are allowed to keep will still be going towards whatever PBS shows they want to keep on the air.
Several tweeters are already giggling at the Big Bird comment
xD
what game is this?
Goodbye Arthur
idk RDash5000
dynamo2814: Just to let you know, that's technically not an image link, more of a website link. Try clicking "view image" next time. :)
k sorry
Good gravy! My popcorn is so sweet! ;~;
dynamo2814: It's okay.
Ponies47: I don't like sweet popcorn :D
Ponies47: Eww, sweet popcorn is bad popcorn.
sonicdude558: Why goodbye, i don't get it.....
I never liked kettle corn. It sucks, IMO. :D
anyone here have a steam account?
Arthur is a good show
:3
sonicdude558, as long as there's an adult fandom of a series on PBS, it'll survive the telathon cycle.
Why do you ask RDash5000?
sonicdude558: ikr?
RDash5000: tiberium12666
AJIsAwesome|Busy: and Zuxxez123 Tastes like (squee) but I shouldn't waste
I am barely even a adult... I am a teen
PBS is like Harry Potter and Narnia. IT NEVER DIES
sonicdude558, young adult
I'm only 14 and will be 15 in December :>
http://www.welovefine.com/3532-9019-large/discord-lord-of-chaos.jpg that's an awesome shirt
It's good, didn't see DIscord at first.
And thank goodness for that
*Discord
What is playing on the stream, I don't recognize the game..
yo CrimsonPhoenix I wouldn't treat it even like a pony shirt
Zuxxez123: Planetside 2.
/me twitched
sonicdude558, exactly
crimsonpheonix i would love to have that
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I see, thanks friend. :3
Ryunosuke: Why are you twitching?
but still Bronies can see the Discord
Zuxxez123: :)
i can't even recognize the game, i have no stream
i am listening to the debate
Eh.. Live stream of the debate is down.
uhh
that's how I want my MLP clothes
yo Ryunosuke are you turning into Pinkie Pie? you getting the twitchy twitchy twitcha twithcha twitches?
The delay is pretty minimal and it's still working
I'm watching on The Blaze TV
http://www.welovefine.com/3518-troll-harder.html <- I would wear that in public :P
I SAW THE FACE OF EVIL..........and his name is DISCORD
Also, LIKE A ROCK
more like twilight going insane twitch
FACE OF CHAOS*
Woh woh, Romney.
Ponies47: :D
NO WAY http://www.welovefine.com/3523-8980-large/mane-six-pony-style.jpg
so Ponies47... Do you like MMMMMMMMMM Bananas?
Meh.
Just when i bought shades
Gangnam style's not my thing.
eeeenope
I am right with you AJIsAwesome|Busy
It's still damn catchy
Sumica: not to mention santorum is a homophobe
I herd the song being played at Canterlot Gardens lol
Catchy, but somewhat annoying at the same time.
just like the DUCKTALES theme song
it's just the fact that there's an actual shirt about it though that fascinate me
AJIsAwesome|Busy: I would walk around and if they asked what's up with my shirt I would just ask if they like "mmmmmmmm banana's" :P
Er.
Dark92Enigma: Okay, Ducktales is an exception.
Why Spain?
gangnam style should burn in hell
DUCKTALES! Whoo-hoo
also I admit I would wear that http://www.welovefine.com/3569-9137-large/breakdance-pon3.jpg
Ponies47: Bring a big cannon with you. :D
since at my place MLP is still very obscure
CrimsonPhoenix: Now that I would buy.
dem graphics bro
dem graphics
AJIsAwesome|Busy: yes, because even if it's catchy, it has an engaging story to back it up
Kandarihu: Starting to feel very sorry for Lehrer.
Dark92Enigma: Agreed.
Kandarihu: Poor guy has NO control in this debate, they're basically stealing time from him.
Sweet I might be going to the theme park this weekend. Guess I'll wear one of my pony shirts :P
CK|Ded, I think it's for the best.
right wing
dang, can't seem to watch the debate
Ponies47: Nice.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: i just don't see Gangnam style 5 years from here
so i see why
Dark92Enigma: Same here.
I just can't get into the song.
Everypony would be horse galloping Dark92Enigma
Kandarihu: Only up to a point.
this kinda reminds me of a futuristic version of Battlefield
http://www.welovefine.com/1846-ponybots.html I wub this shirt that's why I bought one :P
or arma
ok, how long will it keep up? 2 years? 3? 4? 5? oK. ALL BETS ARE OFF
Kandarihu: They have several topics to cover, domestic policy is something that really has to be focused on because it's our biggest problem area right now.
Ponies47: WOW.
That's nice.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: That's mah favorite shirt right now :>
Ponies47: thats awesome!
CK|Ded, I never liked the right wings
tsitra man
Ponies47: Sweet.
that guy is good
RDash5000: IKR? I LOVE it.
Ponies47: Oh Yeah!
Dark92Enigma: It's even cooler when you see the real shirt
Oof, this is uncomfortable. It's still pretty one-sided.
/me doesn't have any brony shirts... :(
^
hey Ponies47 I think i found your answer to a Pony fursuit...
http://www.welovefine.com/890-twilight-sparkle-cutie-mark.html
Gnight everypony
Good night Bronysith
night Bronysith
Night Bronysith
RDash5000: i dont even have brony merchandise
gnight Bronysith
Night, Bronysith :)
Night Bronysith
night Bronysith
Ponies47: man, i wish
superretroworld: me neither
sonicdude558, that's not a fursuit
Goodnight Bronysith!
/me twitches
I know...
but its almost close to it
sonicdude558: wearing that is asking for shit
6_9
DED
sonicdude558, not even
sonicdude558: Nice
sonicdude558: No.....I don't think it's close.
/me 's head explodes
I'm looking forward to solar power droping below other sources.
sonicdude558: Are you talking "suit" suit or wearing something similar to a character suit.
*?
fursuit are most of the time customely home made
yeap
Yay Romney!
Ponies47: rescue bots, beware
6_9
How is that new Transformers show?
/me can't wait for november
/me facehoofs
http://www.welovefine.com/1533-baking-bad.html My second favorite pony shirt that I have. I have it in black :>
I never bothered watching it.
Dark92Enigma: O.O
Ponies47: Okay. That's pretty cool.
Ponies47: i see what they did there...
Ponies47: also, i freakin' love that show
Ponies47: are you alright?
yeah haha, it does that alot
AJIsAwesome|Busy: IKR?
...
Dark92Enigma: Yesh
So let's sum up the two points of view so far
When in doubt, shoot at it.
RDash5000: I can't wait if it airs on my birthday, november 5th
AJIsAwesome|Busy: me neither
Obama wants to keep giving money to Big Bird, and Romney wants to shove Obama's granny off the cliff.
wtf
wut we playin'?
Dark92Enigma: that would be awesome
CK|Ded, I hope you're just joking about that
CK: legit
Ponies47: why the O.O
?
/me twtiches
Dark92Enigma: Being silly :P
Kandarihu: That's what they're both trying to say about their opponent. XD
Ryunosuke: You okay?
Kandarihu: That's how bloody absurd this is starting to get.
CK|Ded: WHOA! that's going off the limits
its like... every time he opens his mouth... my twitch button is pushed
you ok RD? Anything I can do to help? 6_9
Hmm, okay
anyone here ever play amnesia
Nope.
Nah
what game is this?
You buy one shirt from Welovefine and they give you this GIANT bag.
Saw a video on this mod called "The Small Horse"
this looks cool http://www.welovefine.com/927-ap-and-rd-brohoof.html
RDash5000, I don't like it
I agreez RDash5000
adasdad, Avatar Online... I mean Planetside 2 :)
er
thx
RDash5000: It's pretty good.
remove the words brohoof and it would be good
Although the images are stock, I think it's okay.
right? right?
people are talking about big bird in the debate twiter feed, XD
/me likes it even if others don't
Kandarihu: Here's an issue with Romney's stance, he keeps hitting the cuts Obama made to other healthcare policies, but he's recently started saying that he'd keep large portions of Obamacare.
RDash5000: That's fine by me. :)
ded
JUST MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER
<.<
Kandarihu: He needs to differentiate more.
CK|Ded, and THAT is why we can't afford to go to sleep if Romney is elected.
^
define fix
You want a fix to education? I have one: kill the Department of Education
CK|Ded, agreed
cancel it
Right, then I could be on here all night CK|Ded
crap. brb
lol
i recently found out that John Dimaggio (voice of bender on futurama) was a brony. it might not be new info, but it sure as hell made my day
It's a thorough waste of taxpayer dollars and they don't make ANY positive changes. In fact it's their fault that we're looking at closing TONS of schools who can't make these ridiculous "levels" :p
my middle school 3d modeling techer directed the class to the wiki and online tutorials for our education. we suck.
i cant wait to have my own computer so i can stay on here and play minecraft 24/7
adasdad: Wait. Your teacher directed you to Wikipedia? Wow.
Back my little bronies :)
dynamo2814 living the dream
AJIsAwesome|Busy: well, to the wiki for the program we were using.
ho sonicdude558
Wb sonicdude558
if only
adasdad: Instead of teaching with the knowledge she has?
Wikipedia > School
Romney needs to bounce back from that one. Obama's striking a weak point in his platform.
he, and it really isn't that much.
Tiberium126, the reality is that the education is anti-Bible... teaching evolution as if it were proven science.
School should be "Ok goto this wikipedia article. Use the PCs provided in the classroom"
right, before I have an aneuism from ronmney actually rebuking his own words. I have to either mute this out, or turn it off completely
sonicdude558: Nope. School's much better, IMO.
sonicdude558: Plus, people can edit Wikipedia as much as they want.
oh yeah
<.<
sonicdude558, there are better sources for educational materials than Wikipedia
^
i would like an order of free cookies
there goes my head again
/me 's head explodes
And chat is silent....
ikr
...\
its like everyone was looking @ me in awe
sonicdude558: yeah...you have something on your face..
as my head exploded for the 3rd time
what? What is it? a bug?
Jim, for God's sake.
sonicdude558: IT WAS PAIN
/me smacks sonicdude558
OW
Get in there and get control. XD
YOU WILL PAY FOR THAT
sonicdude558: will 20 cents do
50 bits
afternoon all!
ripoff artist!
/me kicks sonicdude558 in the shin
just be glad he didnt ask for 100
*points for anyne who gets the reference*
Hi, Mutterguy :)
/me hides behind Ponies47
hoi Mutterguy
hi Mutterguy
Hi Mutterguy
twilight_sprinkle: Foster's?
/me Huggles sonicdude558
AJIsAwesome|Busy: eeyup! you win 1.1098761 points!
Yay! :D
Romney's wavering a bit here.
also we need to watch powerpuff girls here sometime
We really should watch Foster's home for imaginary friends
twilight_sprinkle: AGreed!
Don't forget Animaniacs
:o no stream what matter of crisis is this??
And Freakazoid.
/me walks back into the main room
i heard PPG's is coming back next year
CK|Ded, he didn't seem to be wavering to me.
Mutterguy: refresh
"Let's not." Hey look, everyone, Lehrer is back
Mutterguy: Wrek's streaming.
To all humans, respect is one of the integral aspects that give us self confidence and meaning to life.
DED
lol
AJIsAwesome|Busy, is Animaniacs and Freakazoid from Craig MacCracken?
Hi
AJIsAwesome|Busy: Someone sent me a link to an episode of Freakazoid. Looks like good stuff.
Tiberium126: /me claps slowly
McCracken even
wat
CrimsonPhoenix: No, but they're still great shows. :S
hi pony47659 :)
yo twilight_sprinkle I challenge you to a match of Fighting is Magic
Kandarihu: Definitely is. He's not hitting things that the undecided electorate will know about.
Sup pony47659
Kinixys firsty time watching freakazoid?
Kandarihu: Agreed.
Can someone tell me what is streaming?
AJIsAwesome|Busy, they are but we were on Craig McCraken right now
Wrek?
where do you even play that at
sonicdude558: how O.o
Dken2021: I've seen one episode. It was good!
CrimsonPhoenix: Not really Craig, just TV shows that involved him.
Planetside II wrek is playing pony47659 :)
Kandarihu: I only vaguely know about Dodd-Frank and I'm generally a pretty educated voter, how likely do you think that point stuck into the undecided voters out there?
Dken2021: LAY OFF THE BEAVERS WILL YA? SHEEEEZ
1 second... My friend told me a way to play FIM through interwebz
sonicdude558, not anyone got the outdated leak
CrimsonPhoenix I could send you the Candlejack episode
GO HAVE SOME COFFEE, WITH CREAM, OR SOMETHING.
This is a HAPPY PLACE
Oh I just said cand...
Mutterguy: No, don't! He'll get hi
Where has Mutterguy been
XD LadyCanary
Kandarihu: He has better points to attack from, that was a really poor choice.
He was here just a second ago
sonicdude558: wait is that through the leaked one?
I was going to snag a copy of FIghting is magic from Canterlot Gardens, but then the panelist said NOES DON'T TAKES IT IT WILL COST US OUR MONEYS >_>
yes it is through leaked one
oh well
I have 5 mins left till bed
sonicdude558, and that leaked is harshly outdated
You can't see me in any of EFR's video'
s
sonicdude558: set the bed on fire
from Canterlot Gardens >_><_<
Back. Managed to escape from Candlejack. He's pretty fa
Fat*?

i couldnt resist!
Wait what is this that is streaming?
I thought I could see my self pushing my glasses up front in the Production Panel
Planetside II

Wrek?
limev is lagging for me too
amirite?
iCandlejack isnt real you dum-
I know mips.tv doesn't like my old PC
sonicdude558: hes streaming yes
HA.
Here's a good tweet.
sonicdude558: Were you there for Hotdiggedydemon's panel?
There we go
Nah I was there only saturday
Er, vice versa
I wish I had 3 day

"Lehrer needs to take control of the debate. #replacementref

twilight_sprinkle: ..........

He keeps emphasizing that. "kill jobs"
*sigh*

I don't think that's a good thing to repeat, actually.
btw I fell in love with the weight of the iPhone 5
also, itunes and istore registration fucking sucks
Sorry if I dont know but is he playing borderlands?
Nop
i'm not touching the update button on my iPad. I REFUSE BECAUSE THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND THE AIRPORT.

AJIsAwesome|Busy: itll be the iiPhone, double the i, duble the powah!
AJIsAwesome|Busy: The Irack. Where you store all your Istuff.
Also, my internet seems to be a dick right now :|
good night pony47659
night pony47659 :)
I like Apple, but they really need to branch out in terms of technology.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: It's a Slow Day!
Night pony47659
BYe, pony47659 :)
And now Obama's bullying poor Lehrer too.
That poor guy.
Thanks, Sethisto. Thanks for the important update :|
AJIsAwesome|Busy, why? does BMW need to branch out? Does HP need to branch out? Does Cingular need to branch out?
Polydunami: Today we'd like to report that we have nothing to report.
emangamer: I'm just saying, I'm sick of them saying that it's "new" and it's "better" but it really isn't.
Thank you, CriticKitten
AJIsAwesome|Busy: that's marketing for you
a shit ton of lies
emangamer: Pretty much for most marketers.
Any time :D
Keyword being "most".
/me sings BBBFF
And chat is slowing down, bit by bit.
eeyup
eeeeenope
Spring glorious Spring~
>_>
<_<
Anyway, I don't know if it's just me or everypony, but the stream is kind of not there for me :S
Spring. Favorite season, next to fall.
:[ BROOKLYN RAGE
Okay, I can see it now :)
Polydunami: refresh my friend
I love it when it's warm and windy.
Ninja'd :P
I've done that twice before, thelonepony
This whole Health Care debacle is why people think there's no difference between Romney and Obama.
Kandarihu: Because the two plans are so similar.
Kandarihu: So Romney emphasizes it less because he's basically saying "it's okay when I do it but not when you do it".
oh no
I have to go...
I will stay here just to see your goodbyes :)
Bye, sonicdude558 :)
bye sonicdude558
See you, sonicdude558
a beer?
Bye sonicdude558
Bye sonicdude558!
seeya sonicdude558
recently my itunes threatened to delete everything on my phone when i connected it to itunes if i didnt sign in with my account
bye sonicdude558
Thank yew
good night
twilight_sprinkle: I can't even sync up my ipod. :S
twilight_sprinkle: It says I need to delete the backup for it.
a french fry?
Question is, how?
Romney wants it to be on a state-by-state basis, though. And states that want no part of a mad program like that might be able to be free from it. That's why Romney's plan is better. There's a way out.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: yeah itunes is the worst thing about the iphone. what it does it copies everything on your phone to a folder on your computer, you need to look up where in the settings
Okay. Thanks, twilight_sprinkle :)
miss...
Kandarihu: Except that now he's saying he'd keep major parts of the plan
miss...
lol at this comment!
np AJIsAwesome|Busy
We're gonna have a big fight on our hands over this either way. We'll have a fighting chance with Romney in office.
"After the debate, Obama will stage a mock debate in which Bill Clinton debates an empty podium and explains Obamacare." LOL
huh, the politics thingy is sounding fun, maybe i should tune in as well
I'm very happy than my family won't ever become bankrupt if someone gets cancer.
twilight_sprinkle: Enjoy the lies
^
Marrowguy, inb4 Kanzius
I pay little attention to polotics period.
AJIsAwesome|Busy: do you know how to delete my account from istore? they somehow managed to register me before i ever finished registering, and it doesnt let me choose no credit-card option
Maybe because I just don't give a damn, not being in USA to begin with.
twilight_sprinkle: That's strange. Hold on a second.
usa politics arent that bad. politics in most slavic countries are a joke, absolute corruption
Polydunami: i live here, and i don't give a damn
Fair enough
Lehrer, good lord man
Just say no
XD
Tom Lehrer?
hmm romney likes talking over other people
He's too polite to run this debate properly.
CK|Ded as in ole Tom Lehrer?
twilight_sprinkle: Yes but its bad for a country that is well developed
as in the writer of the Elements song?
Among others, of course
No, Jim Lehrer.
For a sec I thought Wrek was gonna throw his gun like in Borderlands 2
aww
Oh. Dang :S
The old dude.
DED
RoboGerbil, Lerher tried to let Obama have the last word. Romney had to rebut him
Hey, how many other people are watching the debate?
hello every one
BronyState clans! DO IT NOW
hi cow334
hello cow334
Ralin what debate?
Ralin: I'm listening to it.
Hi, cow334 :)
Ralin listening to it right now
hello Lunar_Brony RDash5000 and AJIsAwesome|Busy
Lunar_Brony, the US Presidential Domestic Policy debate.
RUN WREK RUN
Hey cow334 moo :3
Lunar_Brony: the us presidential.
GOTTA GO FAST!
I wonder how people will respond to Romney's constant push to respond to everything.
Ponies47: eyup Moo ^^
Kandarihu Ralin oh. Nnope.
Ponies47: i have some awesome news
cow334: You do? O.O
He's making the better case but he's doing it by being a bit more rude than he should be, it's rather against the stance he took in the primaries
>start googling 'how to"
>first result is "how to delete friends on facebook"
Hi cow334 Moo :3
seriously :|
do you know about spyro eclipse?
Ponies47: Today i bought a windows seven desktop ...I always gamed with laptops so i thought id try something new
twilight_sprinkle: :D
twilight_sprinkle google "why are ame"
It's double jeopardy for him then.
twilight_sprinkle eems legit
Ponies47: it has 2.10 ghz so it play tf2 pretty good
CK|Ded: The moderator really needs to get control
lol
hello thelonepony
a glass of water?
cow334: Awesome. So now you have 2 computers :P
Ralin: No kidding. He's been bullied so much in this debate.
Ponies47: Eyup ^^
Ralin: They're both stealing large time segments from him.
lol Dken2021 ...
Ponies47: i like desktop better do
Ryunosuke: SNOIPAH!!!
100k is almost nothing. >_>
Letting everyone have an opportunity to succeed doesn't include punishing those who do succeed with huge taxes
That's really not as big a number as Obama wants it to sound.
CK|Ded: But no one will notice.
Ooo. Good opening on that.
Sumica, interesting first world problem you got there
So summary thus far, for those not following the debate:
hello?
Hi, Dante :)
yes this is dog~
hi Dante
Romney likes coal and loves great schools, but hates Big Bird. And Obama hasn't really said anything worth caring about.
Romney is better at distinguishing his points.
quick someone help wrek!, He's pinned down!
:P
Marrowguy: Not dog, I want the hospital!
:I
Hai what's going on people?
What is it, LadyCanary?
Perhaps I could be of assistance, Ryunosuke. Hurr hurrr :I
And it makes it seem like he has more.
:p
I think LadyCanary is the one doing the pinning
I mean shooting at wrek
I would nevur
/me phones a friend to distract from P2
Except maybe I would. :3 for the fun
:)
whelp. im out. ALONSY!!!
bye RDash5000
Allons-y, you mean?
bye RDash5000
This is something that I think Romney drops the ball on, a bit. A lot of the problem in education is NOT the teachers being of poor quality. Sure, there are bad teachers, but as someone who works as a teacher, I'll tell you what's a bigger problem: over-regulation from the government and under-regulation from parents.
inb4 Crimson's rolling in his sleep :D
Polydunami: dr who thing
Bye RDash5000
okbye
RDash5000: Bye :)
Neither of which Romney OR Obama seem willing to admit, because that would alienate voters.
Yeah, I know that much. Me no stupid :|
Polydunami: sorry. misread comment
:3
ok.
bye.
now.
Right, see you rdash
.
..
the game on stream reminds me of something you would see on halo 4
...
I mean RDash5000
..
think its just me
nah i can see that
Obama's slowly gotten back on track, he's more on point now. But may be too late.
Dang it, I tabfailed -_(\
*leaves*
Dante: i know rught
right
mhmm
night
looks like it alot alot
night Lyra`
Aww, did I miss 1000 kicks by Sumica? Dang it :(
23k in debt? Pft, I have about that much. XD
Rather, the thousandth kick :P
it's the fists that are really making get that halo feel though
err insert a me in between making and get
Uh, Mr Romney, did you just admit that most teachers only make about 45k?
The right course is neither of these guys. XD
Because first off, I don't make that much.
I make a lot less.
Second, your party is trying to push that figure as closer to 60k, so you're disagreeing with them now.
Gees CK|Ded maybe you should migrate
i-is Meanwhile still here *banaids all over flutterchu's body*
NICE SHOT RED LEADER
awww are they hello kitty bandaids?
flutterchu: Yep
Lehrer, you did a poor job.
those are the best
Let me reassure you on that.
Heavy assualt is bullets, and bullets, and more bullets. then more bullets
Also rockets.
Well, I need something less depressing than the debate, so what game is streaming now?
StewedOnion
Ralin: Halo 4
Planetside II
Planet Side 2. The battle for Mexico
deleted seens
hoodyninja and Meanwhile uppercuted ant high kicked me, so now im infested with blood
Er Romney, your schools are number 1, true, but not because of you directly. XD
hmpf hmpf
yay! suicide
lls
Thanks.
Wrek is making me ill with his driving
got to go bye every one
bai cow
Bye, cow334 :)
Bye cow334 :)
Bye cow
and gone.
wrek hero tanking
or honor tanking
Knowing the Democratic party, they're not going to be so willing to sit down with Mitt Romney
ill be looking at EQD
wreks new battle cry should be "FOR PONIES!"
Kandarihu: Both parties refuse to work together.
lol the rocket hit the tree
Kandarihu: Why work together when you can blame others? Neither party wants to work together, they want to CLAIM they tried to, but the other guys refused to.
hello everypony
Hi LightTrooper105
Obama knows he lost.
Hi LightTrooper105.
Hey there, LightTrooper105!
LightTrooper105: G'day
You can see it in his face.
hi LightTrooper105
He was just beaten on.
hai LightTrooper105
im feeling happy today~
funn
Why?
why?
/me hugs LightTrooper105
Why not?
hmmm
Hi, LightTrooper105 :)
how cant you feel happy being in bronystate
:3 of course
well I couple days ago I tried getting Planetside 2 AplhaSquad
Personal issues??
what game is this?
Planetside II
Planetside 2
Obama always claimed that he was going to be so peaceful and non-partisan, but he turned around and rammed through some outright horrific legislation and blamed Republicans for trying to say no.
DOH! Ninja'd again! :P
but since Paypal being dumb that time I can't get it..
I swear, I'm getting sick of hearing "the reason is because". That is bad English.
Red spy is in the base!
and i just got a messege i got a beta key lol
Egad, that is horrid, CriticKitten
There were some candidates that were running on reforming the way the gov't works, to get the corruption out, but they were sweeped away pretty early.
LightTrooper105, how long does that take?
Also, dat nick is quite accurate :3
Kinixys hmm, I wonder why?
Kandarihu: I think that Obama needs to be less compromising and blame Republicans more.
Ryunosuke take to?
P2 beta key? :p
Ralin, what are you talking about? That's pretty much been his entire first term in a nutshell.
Polydunami: I've heard them both say it twice now
Oh dear.
oh, is this le Blunderlands 2?
no wait
it's not all cartoony and wierd ass looking
le gasp
I think he miscounted.
is this Halo 5: Halo's Revenge?
He should have said "twelve"
viewer: YOU SUCK!!!!. obama: love you back XD
Kandarihu: Not really, he keeps giving too much ground in compromises when he should take a harder stance and gain political leverage.
nice shot
His strategy is politically unsound.
like that
Because let's be honest, in several areas Obama basically towed the Bush line, and that was a poor decision.
Well, there's a kitty cat rubbing on my legs, begging for food.
dawwwwwwwwwwww
What worries me is the possibility that we'll end up towing that line AGAIN for four more years.
kitty.......
am i dead agian
My kitty's just chilling right now.
nevermind
He's looking at me like "yeah, I'm cute".
CK|Ded: We probably will to some extent, it's just a question of who is less crappy.
My kittehs IDK how they are. I'm not even at my moms :P
oh hi, what are you... OW
is there a live stream of the Obama and romney?
Debate just ended.
:(
You didn't miss a lot honestly.
mmhmm
online play i predict.....
Tiberium126: There is probably a video on Youtube.
Romney was very strongly on point, Obama took a long time to get there....but there was still stupid on both sides.
hmmm *gains urge to look at lolcats*
romney just talked over everyone the whole time
"The reason is because"
i also predict Sumica is streaming
"I love Big Bird"
nah it's Wrex
etc
oh Wrek
Romeny definatly benefited more.
I'm heading out for the night. Bye everypony!
byeee
Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream.
bai Lunar
See you, Marrowguy
BYe, Lunar_Brony :)
Night Lunar_Brony

Wait, I mean Lunar_Brony
See ya Lunar_Brony
nope saying bye to Lunar_Brony

So. What is the goal of this game?
So now comes the question: how will this boost Romney? He needs a big bump right now, because he's losing in key states that he needs to carry. Ohio for one.
Hi SaxyPretender
0,14yo
Sup SaxyPretender!
Hi SaxyPretender
Hey, SaxyPretender
so yeeeeeeah
CK|Ded: I think that it will boost him but probably not enough to win.
G'day SaxyPretender
I do now. (Google... >->)
Woo newsletter
brb
Hi, SaxyPretender :)
It looks pretty awesome, eh?
Ralin: Well a lot of the states are locked in place. Romney has a harder aim.
SaxyPretender: I love that I can greet you and give you a mild compliment at the sane time. "Sup saxy"
But he can still win if he can carry some of the major swing sttaes.
*states.
0,14XD
Ohio is a big one towards that goal, which is why the coal mention was there IIRC.
I'm sure Florida is targeted.
CK|Ded: That's probably true.
nice scenery
0,14I take it this is Planetfall 2?
.......
yea
Planetside 2 :P
0,14>.>
At this point it's actually probably more about base mobilization.
It does, actually. I personally haven't really played much Spyro, but I do have fond memories of the first game.
Heh, MSNBC is really freaking out.
*sniff*
Hi
Hi, CCCP :)
Hi
Ohio ajisawesome
Look look Saxy! Wreky's face on stream :33
0,14I see it XD

Have you played any of tlos games?
Hi CCCP
No, I haven't, actually.
BEEP BEEP
zzzzz
0,14graphics are pretty
yeah, yeah
is it wrong that, failing to find a flyswatter, I used a lighter to kill a fly?
nahh
yay!
i used bug spray once....
Dovah: That poor fly
I got a flygun
Ralin: One thing, though.
coolio
Go for your e-mails guys. Lotto surveys are out
night guys
Dovah: What do think fluttershy would say?
Ralin: What would be really bad? Is if Romney doesn't get the lead from this debate.
Night Derpy_Hooves :)
night Derpy_Hooves
G'night Derpy
spring loaded trigger action and it has a sping
*spring
The only one I've really played is original for the PlayStation, although I didn't play much of it, what I did play of it was good.
Ralin: If he ends up still behind in the polls, then I don't think he's got any chance of winning. I don't think he'll get another chance.
derp that's redundant
ah
and also this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Hiqa8ainU
LOL
CK|Ded: He might be able to pull it off in the next debate, but he won't have the challenger bonus he got this time.
shirley: i marked you as spam. pierce: who the hell is pam? xD
Ralin: Not likely. Most undecided voters make their decision in the first debate.
AHA
OH MY GOD
a new way to pick pony episodes :)
?
Twitter is on fire with the debates. XD
i hope twitter is beating facebook atm
I like Twitter :>
I won't vote *just* yet since the lotto goes for double digits most of the time, but is the new pony episode drop-down menu in effect with this survey?
hey yo wuts up everypony:)
No, seriously. It's getting hilarious. http://derpy.me/9jwcs
Hi scout19_tf2 :)
Hey scout19_tf2
G'dau scout19_tf2
ohai scout19_tf2
LOL
Hi, scout19_tf2 :)
J_E_Smith71, ye
I'm probably out of place in a Spyro community considering I've only played a little of one game. Not that it's stopped me before. XD
i c Wrek is streaming
yuupp
Ohai scout19_tf2
.....also, this is a thing
dafuq?
hi scout19_tf2
@FiredBigBird
xD
Ping Timeout?
yeah probably
does anypony know how to make an youtube chanel
Okay, for those of you who missed lotto last week and didn't see Shizuka's announcement: When you vote for pony episodes, you now select them from a drop-down menu instead of typing it in.
scout19_tf2: you should use youtube to help you
scout19_tf2: when going to youtube, you should find create account
I used to have those happen all the time... Mainly because I had a horrible wireless card on the computer that always happened on...
create an account then a chanel
Alright. Cats are fed, and Dinner is ready.
dont gmail accounts work as youtube accounts?
eeyup
I'm going to be idle for a bit.
:D that on a tank
This done so we don't have repeat episodes over and over. So not all episodes will be in the menu. In fact, beginning with last week's episodes, episodes that have been played will not be available on the menu until we run through all episodes
Yu-Gi-Oh?
brb
Guys
let's vote Show Stopper
CrimsonPhoenix: ?
You know you want to hear the CMC theme song
Kandarihu: Twitter is alight from the Big Bird line. XD

Welcome back, Dark92Enigma! :)
Kurra was right, there was an anime stream!
SPOONY?
So he just got MLG aimming all of a sudden?
like, spooning, you know.
A: Pirate of Caribbean
Stranger Tides
I know, you reminded me of Noah Antwiller, formerly known as the ''Spoony''
SeaponiesofLiverpool: ALREADY?
Gonna do it too
I just got the email
another death
:(
Is everyone suicidal?
I don't think you guys have had Pirates: Stranger tides for movie night yet right?
00,10I think he mad
but how, youve shared your personal story as well!!!
Or, perhaps Gundams have Spoon parts. :D
B: The Postman
DerpyMuffins: And Massochist
he ded
spoon dawt jp. Performance parts, and they ARE from Japan too
was going to pick the Dune (2000) as an A movie
because it absolutely is an A movie
this time, My picks for movies will win
but decided Pirates
Isn't Dune like 600 hours or something?
He sounds like Vegeta now
6 hrs. yes. that's why I picked it
I'm the PRINCE OF ALL SAYIANS.........PREPARE TO DIE
Less talk, more rock. Shut up Aleluya. XD
Yup he is Vegeta alright
I hope my b movie gets picked
that's the one I REALLY want
00,10you know a long movie like that will just end up geting vetoed
The love intrest
:
:'(
that's not what it said on the lottery, so no I did not know
So no war and peace then?

maybe stream but not BMN stream
DerpyMuffins: ikr
Scifi miniseries week?
00,10do all those run past 2 hours?
..how long has there been a stream?
TinMan, Dune, Children of Dune, Peter Pan
DerpyMuffins: i'm watching DBZ (TV) and Gundam00 (stream) AND.......the former is better
each part I think is about 2 hrs. long
get.the.fuck.on.with.it.
does that mean i don't like Gundam00?
nope
so a miniseries week might be fun
not yet

hi RAWRity
So many new Gundams
whats wrong with her?
And some of them fail
what is a Gundam?
Gundams: still the most ridiculously unnecessary technological advancement in Sci-fi
it's 500 tons of metallic bawss.
0,14A miserable pile of bolts!
You have gun and decide to use a sword instead?
well crap
Sword beats GN fields.
gundams gundams everywhere
Whats the Gundam count?
so this is what you bronies do when I'm asleep!
unnecessary? theyre excellent machines of war, very much necessary for war
Made my movie choices!
yaaay
kidzrul434: eeyup :3
Nopony will beat me for them
you have spaceships that are far easier to pilot, but still decide to build gigantic, hard to pilot, engineering nightmares for the soul purpose of making fighting HARDER?
hello
Sylandest!!!
Hi, XylemTube :)
Panda: wut
RAWRity : Plot
hi XylemTube
Oh gosh XDDD
hay XylemTube
RAWRity: Not to mention AI controled war machines would be far more accurate.
I dunno Sylandest!
spaceships only work in space. and the gundams have more dexterity
That Pinkie Pie voice?
screw this I'm going back to bed
Panda: I dunno either!
There's someone who looks like Pinkie, and someone else who sounds like her.
I was gonna say
00,10yeah SaxyPretender
Sort of sounded like Pinkie Pie O.O
YES

hi Ponies47!
twilight_sprinkle: "dexterity" doesn't justify the logistic and engineering leaps needed just to get one of these things to move a finger. let alone move in any accurate, dependable way.
werent you already here, Panda ?o.o
Yes he was

Dem Channelings attack again?
00,10and setsuna gives no fucks
Oh come on, at least slap him...
everyone has a sob story, pal
RAWRity: but they were made. and after they were made, they made the machines. first breakthroughs are made in physics, then its used in engineering, not the other way around
Or shoot him
kill the psychopath
Gun. *headache...*
Shoot him and we can end this
YEAH, by killing him, you WILL GET THEM BACK! Idiot
Pillz Here!
Flashback
grabn' heroin
0,14HE IS A CHAR
SMirnof
Lieutenant Smirnoff?
twilight_sprinkle: do you even know what words mean? We know the PHYSICS of how a humanoid robot would move. It would just take an unbelieveably inconvenient amount of time, work, and energy to build something like a gundam. We're still at the point where building a life-sized prostethic hand that moves sort of like a human one is difficult.
Smirnov?
how do guys 15,000 light years out in space for like three year deployments stay looking ike they just came from Vidal Sassoon's? XD
He must be russian
hey issent that the shyco guy?
Kurra, plastic surgery :D
*pshyco
XylemTube: In Soviet Russia, FATHERS FIND YOU!
I had no idea that RAWRity could construct sentences that way.
^^
twilight_sprinkle: not to mention these things don't add anything in terms of movement or firepower that you couldn't get from a well designed spaceship.
But what about their hair? XD
RAWRity: and do you know how to read and not act like an arrogant twerp? liek i said, they Made the advancements and Then they started building the machines in an efficient way
/me shakes his plot
Panda: and i thought i was the only one (during movie time)
ohai :3
00,10heres a thought, it's a fucking show
O_o

Bye Dark92Enigma
:)
twilight_sprinkle: how did they start building it in an "efficient" way? Efficient would mean it's faster and more convenient to build these than armored gunships. And I don't see that happening unless every engineer and mechanical expert on the planet started taking crack and refused to build anything that wasn't garishly painted and humanoid.

Kurra: Tanks
RAWRity: the machines work in a similar way to the human body, only more bulky and less agile. that isnt very hard to engineer and build, the main probel was the energy required to move them quickly, but they discovered the GN particles
bye derpymuffins
*main problem
Newguns can't fusion?
RAWRity: It's just a show. It's mostly about the human drama.
twilight_sprinkle: oh yes, stuff like that isn't hard to build. That's why we have fully functioning cybernetic limbs for amputees. OH WAIT.
RAWRity: "the main probel was the energy required to move them quickly, but they discovered the GN particles "
You gotta get your hard sci-fi fixes from books.
0,14how about we drop the kvetching and watch, yes?

wtf they have robots but they have shitty cars
Kinixys: judging by the olympics this year, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Sumica: try her wiki page?

a short excerpt from "This Book is Full of Spiders (Serioiusly, Dude, Don't Touch It): "There exists in this world a spider the size of a dinner plate, a foot wide if you include the legs. It's called the Goliath Bird-Eating Spider, or the "Goliath Fucking Bird-Eating Spider" by those who have actually seen one."
"It doesn't eat only birds - it mostly eats rats and insects - but they still call it the "Bird-Eating Spider" because the fact that it can eat a bird is the most important thing you need to know about it. If you run across one of these things, like in your closet or crawling out of your bowl of soup, the first thing somebody will say is, "Watch it, man, that thing can eat a goddamned bird."
"I don't know how they catch the birds. I know the Goliath Fucking Bird-Eating Spider can't fly because if it could, it would have a different name entirely. We would call it "sir" because it would be the dominant species on the planet. None of us would leave the house unless a Goliath Fucking Flying Bird-Eating Spider said it was okay. "

WARNING: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR. You will dismiss this as ridiculous fearmongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fearmongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection - the creature secretes a chemical into the brain to stimulate skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure.

NENUDJUS: it is, stream is over

o thanks
RAWRity, typical reversing the reversed psychology to that it only confuses the person into manifesting those fake beliefs in their mind. Mainly based on the fear of the unknown that many of us have.
i am your host, the man they call ghost
You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You can't see it, because it decides what you see. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will bread. So what happens when your family, friends, and neighbors get mind-controlling skull spiders? We're all about to find out.
"And it will bread" :D
NENUDJUS: ghost ftw
Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is not the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.
gotta love ghost, he really puts in a lot of effort to entertain people
ghostler is best pony!
Bread vectors. We must stop them at the brad!

i wish he would come back..
Just got back. What are you guys chatting about?

Why are there videos with this guy's voice? Is he from some talk show or what?

he doesnt lighten because hes one of those people whove chosen to bitch about life during their entire life and do nothing about it
o.o
they also get to be lazy that way
Kinixys: if tab doesnt work it means hes gone, or your chat died :P
o.o
I've never seen him in a happy mood at all ever since I've been here.
Meanwhile has to learn to keep it to himself when he's about to bitch about stuff

ohai NewSuperBronyU.

NewSuperBronyU: Just letting you know, we're not insulting Meanwhile. Just discussing about him.
the engineer in the background...
twilight_sprinkle: Thanks.
Kinixys: np :)
AJIsAwesome: who cares if we insult him, he insults us.
true
I could understand why Meanwhile is that way because of all the stuff that's happening to him right now, but that doesn't mean he can push all his negative emotions on us.
nah i dont think its cause hes going through a tough time or anything
he just seems like hes an uneducated person whos chosen to be lazy and hate life and do nothing about it
I can see that.
if he's about to say something negative, he has to keep it to himself
and his constant grammar correcting is funny because his knowledge of english is actually very mediocre
a step beyond the casual vocabulary and he already makes grammar mistakes occasionally
although i dont really care about grammar myself that much tbh
I care to a certain extent.
while i try to use proper grammar anyway, i only care about it as long as the other person can understand correctly, beyond that imo its not that important
He doesn't really seem to know how to take control of his own life, IMO.
11,02I'm a silly o3o
hes at the pc 24/7 and he doesnt go to college, so idk what hes doing

twilight_sprinkle: That's what I was wondering. It seems that he's looking for employment, but he's here on a constant basis.
NewSuperBronyU: YOU EXCITED?! :3
11,02YEAH O3O
AJIsAwesome: dont think he can get any kind of good employment with his education, especially since hes not going to college. i dont really know the prices of college education in england though
Can't wait to see you try out the WiiU NewSuperBronyU :3
twilight_sprinkle: Okay.
11,02Wish you were here so we could play together in person ;3;
11,02No ;A;
NewSuperBronyU: Same here. :(
>.>
College = High School?
i dont even have a tv for a console lol
hey
hey, if anyones awake
hi Cades
so the Pc is your tv?
pretty much
thats cool

NewSuperBronyU: agh!
eh, i dont have any channels here to watch tho
/me facedesks
all i got is bronystate and youtube
There are ports on the newer monitors that will take all kinds of connections, including from consoles.
yeah but i just have a laptop..
I've always had this curse where I'm always caring for other people's well beings. The fact that Meanwhile doesn't really let anyone in makes me sad and wishes that he would let people help him instead of rejecting them.
which is about 4 yrs old
In Australia we just have primary, High school then Uni
plotstallion! Sylandest is plotstallion :D
I have a converter box for hooking my ps2 to my monitor. XD Does look that great, but it works.
Doesn't*
ViolaGrey: agh!
=3
11,02Plotstation is second best console \:D/
xD
:D
AJIsAwesome: i try to care about others though. but the only way to help him is to knock sense into his head the hard ay and show that the world doesnt revolve around him and he should do something to make the world better
AJIsAwesome: Is that so? That is very sad. Sometimes people need help, but don't relize this themselves.
twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
whats with the whole plotstallion thing? i dont get it ;^;
*sigh*......
oh wait
twilight_sprinkle: Borderlands 2. :D
so Meanwhile is like Shinji

thelonepony: I guess you could say that....
NewSuperBronyU:
I blame you

Diamonds in the rough
where els are you going to find diamonds?
in gold?
It's called an expression.
:3
You can collect comments, but they have to be in physical form. So you would have to chissel them out on clay tablest in sumarian and place them in protective glass cases. Then you will have collected them.
:P
i know
but sumarian was writen on clay then baked
or rather stabed into clay
baked like my friends fro mhigh school
Details details.
so that's why they called it 'high' school

Polydunami: ikr
Well, whatever. Not like it's the end of the world.
Not yet, at least :P
Doesn't best pony change for everyone?

Sorry for slowness. I wasn't paying attention. Hi.
thats ok
*recent chapter
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oh my. What happens to her?
Welcome :] Dont think ive seen you here before
Is it something suggestive? :S
It's probably something horrible.
Nope. That's because this is my first time here.
I don't know :S
awesome
I don't know what timezone your in, its not very active at this time
Chat dies :<
AJIsAwesome: nothing its just the only human there killed a bear in self defense and Shy chews him out but then he accidentally snaps at her and tells her of a world he was in *think Quantam Leap stuff* and had to kill a friend to end his suffering
I actually need to idle for a little while, need to do something in a bit
.-.
But wanted to say hi so you don't think this place is deserted :/
At Fluttershy of all ponies ._.
I noticed, but that's okay. Its 1:47 AM here, so... I'd expect no one to be here. I'm a night owl, and that's fine. I'm also doing stuff.
._.
hmmm well
.___.
If you plan to be on a while, I can finish up my stuff and be up for a chat
hmm
Yep.
That kind. If I'm still here and you finish, than I guess that's okay.
ill probably be 30-40 min
Polydunami: well she got FlutterRage,shoved Dash out of her way and called him a monster and what not but he had a broken arm from the event and was still full of adrenaline plus he does regret it and yeah :S

Well, okay then :$

/me puts everyone back to sleep with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OLJXVGh0ss
Oh. Hi!
If your still there...
I dunno.
Maji ka,Maji de,Maji da SHOWTIME~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qx3tTj4r6I
I just posted that! So I'm totally still here!
I want gummy to be my pet IRL
I had no idea. I just checked the page and noticed.
AdamTheDuck: zzz zzz zzz
Oh, Japan.
Amu your still on? o.o

I figured youd be sleeping by now
Good to see you stuck around Patches :P
Madre de dios!!!
It's only midnight! Usually I'm watching anime by now. XP
I'm less lonely now :D
taoumi: lol but 0_o
i forgot that my mother is awake
xD Sketch_Toku_Brony
I don't go to bed as early because I haven't gotten a new job yet since moving.
Same here. I usually don't have anything to do this late.
so...Patches did you wanna introduce yourself?
never seen those guys before?
taoumi: now it just needs the mane 6 from those tf2 vids lol
taoumi: nope
eh?
Normally I'm close to sleeping by now, but ive been busyier these days so I tend to stay up real late
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fKGjEMgjko
they are the same guys that di this one
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOv4HHOtn1E&feature=related
I dunno what I would tell you... I'm always bad at talking about myself.
Ah.
damn it, Guild Wars 2 is down for maintenance
Are you a spyro fan in general? like any other games?
maybe just a fan of dragons?
taoumi: lol its funny but alittle creepy :D
taoumi: :D
the MMD makes it a bit wonky at times
shoudl i break out the sticky buddy?
you gusy seen sticky buddy?
I love mythical creatures, especially dragons. I'm planning on beating all the Spyro games... Yes, I do love Spyro, and roleplaying. Yay?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlSF0dtDRD8
beating all the spyro games will take a while
I don't do much roleplaying, although I know someone here does
Hes super detailed on RPs
Nice! I'm oddly enough not a big Spyro fan for someone going to a Spyro community... Only played a bit of the original one, I liked what I played but never really played it much.
I don't do roleplaying much because the site I use to get up kind of died... So, I haven't found anywhere else to go. I haven't done one in forever, so I'd probably be awful, length wise.
:D dafuws w/ that old lady>!
taoumi: :D Lolwat?!
dat old lady
xD
where did you go before?
Tiberium126: i just had a sudden craveing for pizza!

were you having second thoughts or something?
Black Lagoon is a fun anime
indeed
Yeah. I haven't done much. Just got on, really. I don't really have much to say, since I haven't explored much...
the hard part is having a topic everyones interested in
NENUDJUS: you should really go to bed
DeadpoolDash: wow that black lagoon looks like a good anime
it is and it has a great dub
a lot of the characters have pony VAs
about as bloody as elfen leid
Tiberium126: its to late now i need to get up at 6 AM if i went to bed now i would not wake up

then again Twi may work better
Well, I don't really like the newer ones, but this one has a plot and missions you have to do to save your town... Its a lot different, and has WAY better graphics than Sims 3 does on my DS...
whats the plot about?
see you all later (30 mins) ima so bored ima go take a 12 lb dump!
/me is eating xP
dear god http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/181383njgcb58jpg/original.jpg
i see how it is...
Okay, that makes my stomach better :D
You work as a janitor in a big hotel, and you get fired, and find out that Harlan King, the original owner of the hotel, sold the hotel to Daddy Bigbucks, who plans to turn the whole town into a tourist trap, or something of the sort. So, you have to help get rid of him... I keep replaying it.
Are you replying it to get it 100%?
DeadpoolDash: ...so AWESOME lol /)^3^(\
I dunno. I just keep playing it again and again. Even though I know exactly what to do, it still takes me forever to beat... SO AMAZING.
I know right
what makes it so long? sidequests?
awesomer
Nah. There are just some missions that require sometime to complete. Like, you help this guy reopen this island that Daddy Bigbucks shut down, and you have to wait 10 days for it to complete being rebuilt.
10 days? does the game use the DS clock?
hey in honor of Nightmare Night found 2 Best Friends Shitstorm of Scariness! :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWwX-QhWQy4
No... I wish!
this episode Ju-On The Grudge (Wii) :D muhaha
it would take you even longer then
Yup... Even though the time in the game goes way faster than regular time, it felt like forever. At least a gray pop-up comes when its finished, so you don't have to keep checking or keep track with the days.
and theyre doing vids EVERY NIGHT ALL OCT.!
NewSuperBronyU do green do green
lol i can already see a Two Best Sister Shitstorm of Scariness :D
It does sound different than other sim games
I might check a video of it on youtube
I think I need to head off though, I really need some sleep
Yeah, very. You still have to take care of the person, and they have very little clothes options, but its still fun...
Alright. Me too, actually. I have to get up in the morning...
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU
well hope you come back :P
/me hugs JRP2234 back :)

Uhh nothing like a Russian school girl with a kitchen knife to creep you out in a horror movie...
ye...
good lod days
old*
...orphan?
DeathStar, eeyup...
I'm not sure why my friend even suggested this to me XD
AdamTheDuck: it's alright when your watching it with friends... and it teaches you the importaint lesson that people who are different are evil and should be feared
if your in to scary movies watch cupcakes
scard me
:'(
never se pinkie the same
NENUDJUS: no thanks... I like pinkie how she is in my head
Hehe NENUDJUS, I showed her Cupcakes so she said I have to watch this for her now XD
but Orphan isn't that bad...
:P
I know I'm I chicken when I comes to horrer movies
DeathStar, yeah it's not that bad, just strange at times.
"i spit on your grave"
lol trailer
And strangely I'm not enjoying it as much, it doesn't seem "real" I guesss.
guess*
classic one
Ooh plot twist
Shit's getting real
wooOOOooo
AdamTheDuck: what part are you up too?
DeathStar, you've seen it?
AdamTheDuck: yeah
*Spoilers although you might not even want to see the movie anyway* DeathStar, the part where the doctor explains she isn't an orphan but instead has a physical disorder to look as a child
AdamTheDuck: ah okeys.. that's when things start getting good
BAZZAAR!
God damnit, it's like rule no. 1 of any horror movie, every character is so mindless...
me so hungery!
I was smiling my ears off at the end of doctor who this season.
no food,so lazy, no stores open....
AdamTheDuck: exept possibly the villian
NENUDJUS: so lazy you can't grammer

everypony is leaveing me!
Moo
http://youtu.be/Tkcqg64niyA

from 8PM - 5AM
so many gone!
yes, bbeing for 21 hours will do that to you.
Oh wow, east coaster?
*up
/me is sleepy -_-
:3
i was sleepy 5 hours ago...
iv been waiting for phase4's wub and "fireworks"
Phase4 has something planned?
NENUDJUS, can't. internet is over the limit
Oh dear
!!!!
Ghost pony rage!!!!
i COULD use the machine BerryPunch is on and stream a show, but theres none stored on it right now
Phase4 would willing let a person he met from the internet take the the helm as the streamer? 0.0
...
Mutterguy, i would need to monitor the stream, and that would prevent me from doing other things
fair cop
mods aren't chosen, they are created
its so sad
Only one who masters the moo may stream.
I wouldn't be modding I'd just be providing the the vehicle for the stream
so no wub or "fireworks" ... :'(
whats the point of liveing!
in some dark smelly room in Bronystate, the mods are made out of left over bacon bits
that's just Lord baconmane
Haven't seen much of him, lately
and left over bacon bits are hard to come by, because who really leaves left over bacon?
^
so fuggin tasty.
Vegetarians?
Polydunami: nah they don't even buy the stuff.
I guess so
Even so, vegan burger patties are delicious :3
... Yeah, I'm noticeably sleepy -_-
its not really a burger without the meat
Bah. It's tasty anyway
anything is tasty with LSD
What's television got to do with taste? :S
omg i leave for 5 seconds i come back and you guys are talking about LSD
Wait, I thought I saw LCD for a second :S
come on!
http://youtu.be/-S2iRPk1UDA

You're lucky; my chat goes to 11 :P
Wait, I mean 7pm

You're about three timezones off, NENUDJUS; I live on the west coast
hmm
Yeah, like I said before, I am sleepy and I think I shall go to bed.
Good night, everypony who is still up.
Polydunami you'd be a wise man
a plane can go from the east coast to the west coast in less then 10 hours why can't time...
I would be, if I weren't so foolish :P

:O tell us!
051st: as i was waiting for the bust and it arrived, and old lady was runnign to catch the bus at the stop, and the driver was grumpy and jsut wanted to dash of, so i jsut stood there in the door and got yelled at as i let the old lady pass in before me with a smile.

hur hur bust
Wrek: :D awesome

Wrek: Hey! Nice to meet you :)
MadSurge: I don't usually read fanfics but recently ive started getting into it
i dont allways read fanfic, but when i do i read my little dahie
052nd act: this known douche at school tried to cut the lunch line, he's basicalyl a dope so he started isnulting me and push me sligthly, so i asked him again to move to the back of the line, even heared 1 or 2 peopel back in the line yelling "yeah you [yay] get in line". upon refusal i punch him in the plexus and throw him to the side. he swings for my head but i deflect so it hits my
5shoulder and with my free hand swing downwards hittign sideways on his knee, then he gave up. a bit later a professor turns up and asks whats goign on, knowing the otehr guy is a torublemaker i got away spot free and got applause by the queue
05muahaha
i tried to write a MLP fan fic, but the haters said i should kill myself rather then continue the story
05viking powahs AWAY

o.o
Vordox, https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html this is the spec, i forget exactly what the prefix is on chrome

Hi AdamTheDuck
Ohai DoctoDoctorWho
AdamTheDuck: you know how much buffering luna means to me atm
05now this fic assumes you knwo a little about fallout
05but it shouldnt be too much of a problem
AdamTheDuck: My fic has a new chapter if your interested in reading,
05again this is jsut a test to see if my voice is ebarable for thsi shit
omg i feel the walls closing in now
05will start after the song
Phase4: Awesome! Thanks! And here YOU go!
http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/03/back-to-basics-how-to-code-an-html5-template/
DoctoDoctorWho, ooh cool, I'll check out my FIMFiction soon
i can feel it comeing!
05or you guys can show no interest... if you dont want me to jsut tell me :|
AdamTheDuck: wanna link or will you just find it later?
our time is short buffering luna!
DoctoDoctorWho, I have your page bookmarked, don't worry.
05anyways hit resfresh
no
Wrek: Im sure everypony will be delighted to hear your voice wrek
i will stay with buffering luna!
NENUDJUS, hehe XD
kk
05then jsut shut up about it
Phase4: Good place to start.
you hurt me!
on the inside
Wrek I am
05you should be seeing mips yes?
Yes
I'm seeing Mips, but nothing.
mips we see
I see mips but just the buffer
Im off, cya everypony :) ill be on later
bingo!
*sniff* ill miss you buffering luna
NOW there is stuff
i refreshed it
yep
confirming piano
Vordox, the functions are prefixed with 'webkit', eg: webkitAudioContext
wow wrek are you singing the book?
:P
Vordox, i'm not sure firefox has suport yet
Phase4: ...
Phase4: For HTML5 or Javascript?
for the web audio api
._.
But Firefox is a big part of the internet. BLEH
it'll happen soon
Well, Javascript can handle the syntheziser
:O
That SHOULD be working well right?
I'll load the sound into javascript audiobuffer
Through online means but native reading
05i dont like your tone there NENUDJUS
<.<
wrek what do you mean?
Brony Gone Wild?
i take it wrek is live? :p
uhuh
I suggest http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23693/This-isn%27t-my-House!#page/4 wrek
Phase4: Weird, I found this but it doesn't talk about the audiobuffers, that's the info I need now. D:
one sec
Preload but no play from memory/audiobuff
volume is good
volume is stuff is fine
*and
seems fine
Vordox, uh, the link i sent you has that
besides, fallout is simply an ungodly awesome game
it'S also cheap
Phase4: ...
Vordox, https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#AudioBuffer
Phase4: Derp, I searched for REal Time audio, but it was supposed to be Audio Buffer :D
6_9
erm.. what new vegas reading?
Phase4: Awesome, so the site should have the flash, Javascript sound.
you're hearing new vegas isnpired stuff right now
I got AS3 ready, HTML5 if I can, and Javascript reading time....
Vordox, not sure what you meen, thats a javascript interface
Wrek will have material for weeks if he kepts it up
i did big MT at lv 5, before even going to Novac
not bad
it was really tough at lv 5.. but i levelde fast
Phase4: >.> Javascript interface?
weeks is god. if he goes for the big ones too, he will besitting here for months
Phase4: What you mean exactly? Interface as?
Vordox, what i linked is the standard for a javascript interface
I thoght it was how to make use of the functions
it defines their behaviours
A sec, Phase4.
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/Wayward-Courier for reference
gonna be interesting
Dis is gettin' goooood
Phase4: http://imageshack.us/a/img35/3227/exsite.jpg
This is what I have in mind
sound in javascript and animations in flash?
Flash handles the graphics, and the JavascriptSound Handler fixes the real time sound
Yeah
That way I solve the issues AND make it look snazzy
I can send AS3 signals that handles the Javascript
Of course, one time signals for each sound load
you're going to get random lags betwene as3 and javascript
ipc channels and all that
...
So you're saying this is a bad idea?
if your in actionscript you kinda need to use their sound, or if your going javascript you need to go all javascript
haha, yes you can
that sledgehammer
Vordox, i'm not 100% certin of this, never worked actually worked with actionscript
Well
The animations and code causes low latency
/me wished he was more prepared and had earphones and a rum and coke
But the code for AS3 should send during a push = Signal sent = Play this audio buffer
With no sound in AS3 it should be quite smoother
(Atleast statistically is another thing.)
I haven't done research on Latency for AS3 to Java
javascript*
Vordox, you could measure it, echo from javascript and measure the delay
both languages have milisecond timers, possibly microsecond
Cool!
Good point, I'll look it up
i'm trying to watch stream but bandwidth limit is breaking it
Phase4: Think you can do it? :P
Vordox, do what?
Phase4: Do the echo stuff cause I have 0 javascript knowledge. XD
med-x is best-x
Vordox, start with the video i linked and go from there
night NewSuper.... missed him
Mutterguy, 2 things
Damn I missed Wrek reading? :<
hmm?
1) man without coffee, and 2) Pinkie pie WITH coffee :)
awesome isn't it
getting a little silent there at parts. might wanna look out for that
its glorious
else, not bad
It was good wrek.
I just wish I had earphones because i dun wanna wake the folks
o im so tired
im going to bed
cya all
Bye NENUDJUS
Morning everypony. I feel like crap. .-.
Ohai Ponies47

Hugs make people feel less like crap right?
Ponies47 cuddle up in bed and listen to wrek read stories
Goodbye everypony
Hehe, I'm doing the same thing Mutterguy :$
Bye DoctoDoctorWho
Mutterguy: I'll fall asleep.
poor twilight
So what is Wrek reading? By what I've heard so far, it's about FO:E.
courlier now has the 'wheres my pants' perk
It's a Fallout Courier in Equestria
Not as in feeling like crap as in being a jerk or somthing. I feel like crap because I'm sick .-.
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/2/Wayward-Courier/02

Sort of Wrek
/me wishes he knew how to record the livce stream
I'm still listening Wrek
You stopped the silence half way through the chapter though
um theres an occassion bit of lag but it seems to pick up on the next word
Hey there, what's going on?
Ohai ofna01, just Wrek reading from http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/3

05hope ya liked >_>
05despite quality
I did Wrek :3
it's fine
Quality isn't that bad
But then I was never fussy for quality.
wouldn't even know english is your second language
the 3rd chapter was best reading of the 3
What really? It's Wrek's second language?
yeah he's Swedish
05^
thinks of monty python quotes
05i might keep reading later
05but not today
Can't.. there was the norweign blue and 'Finland' a song but nothing about Sweden
05cause for soem reasoni gett really coarse in the voice
05be careful not to get bitten by a moose
oh the credits...
This live reading right now is really fine. How are you doing the instrument sounds with your voice? >_>
05lol Kandarihu
hes beat boxing the whole thing
I hear guitar and bass.
And trumpets
he might have had to use a distortion filter though
05i suck at making kazoo noises though
Ah, distortion filter. It's like duct tape, but for full instrumental beatboxing?
o_o
Monty?

MONTY PYTHON <3
pinkie pie probbably first wrote that joke
Oh, this-- a classic.
yeah but Pinkie pie is no man
StinkomanFan: Pinkie would say "eh, I've heard better jokes"
And then the british government would lose thousands of men trying to impress Pinkie Pie
Dat german gibberish
trivia: the German version of the joke was rendered as nonsense in order to prevent accidental deaths
or as twilight would say:
"I dont get it"
Hello everyone.

StinkomanFan: when everything it takes is some slapstick to make her laugh

With luck I´ll be feeling better tomorrow, so I'll have a free day then instead of today. :P
Nick_Scratch|Music: no problem. And this weekend, there's a movie night, and you're invited°!
Yes, I'm wallowing in self-pity, feel free to slap me for it (gently) or just ignore it. I'm just feeling sorry for me. :P
O NO THE COSHINS
I feel like crap but I'm not gonna skip a day of school. I'm just gonna have to deal with it. I would love to miss a day of school because I hate it and everyone there but I still need to go.
I love movies
Also don't wanna fall behind
Ponies47: that's the spirit
Ponies47: :(
heh nope

Well Ponies47, I work in customer service. Specifically, I'm on phones. It's a bit tricky to uphold a call without much voice left. :p
I applaud your motivation though.

AdamTheDuck: :D I've been a part of bronystate since about May of this year

Sylandest, hehe I know that feeling :3
You must agree with me though, Spike is definately best pony.
I figure that I've made a pretty good spot for myself here, lol. I love being here. Its always fun, and the friends I've made are some of the best people around
AdamTheDuck: nope. That title belongs to my AJ

Hey. Spike's a great guy, no denying that. But you did say best "pony".

I wonder what Ace Ventura's cutie mark would be if he were a pony
^
A can of Hairspreay, ASoftFluffyThing
spray*
heavies would be a sandvich
Or his hair style. :D
So he's a tree?
So I guess it would be a magnifying glass with a pawprint?
He is a pet detective, after all.
hi
Hmm, that would work.
You know, It's something how they're giving out Genesect so soon after Keldeo. Keldeo's event is still going!
Maybe on November 13th we get Meloetta?
It is?
Crap. I need to get it now.
You have until Oct. 6th to get Keldeo.
(This Saturday)

*mips
The Medic has like 450 teeth.
/me catches the ball, dripples a bit around with it, before rolling it back to AJIsAwesome :)
Ooh LimeV

Sumica: if GNAA members try trolling, send them this: http://rdash.in/banned/
rdash: oh, well, you can if you wish to :D
I'm getting lag. But it's early so......
Sumica: Its guaranteed to get a few laughs xD
mica my thing refuses to play
00,10perhaps I should just restart.
has the Medic ever dated Colcate? it's so bright when he smiles XD

okies, Sumica

Dummkopfs does not exist in the german language, it's grammatickal nonsense
we're pausing to restart
I just use some default which is on this page
grammatical*
it's Dummköpfe ^^
Eh, most likely no, then
rdash, what's GNAA?
google it...
(Sumica@Shoo.Be.Doo) Quit
or at least the singular, Dumkopf -.-
trust me, google it...
also, that video is hilarious
rdash: wow, didnt not see that coming :D
lol
glad you guys like it...
the source for that page is like 14 lines of html
that buffermoment is quite nice
i threw it together as a joke for the #bronymusic guys who got trolled this morning...
they love it xD
rdash, no channel advertising
oh sorry.. wasnt trying to... just saying...
Giant buffer is killing us!
anyway, I'm out, laters :>
bye kurra
What OS are you using Blako?
Hm..GNAA is familiar.
laters, ku-gone
You can try using Pidgin, you can set it to make a sound if someone mentions your name
bye kurra
weren't they the ones that got AlexS' YouTube closed like sometime last year?
wooT the OCRemix Kickstarter is at 91k and at 100K I get a theird Album I get 3 Physical Albums *JOY*
Wait, who got AlexS' account closed down?
Brb.
I use lubuntu (linux) and I can remember I was using pidgin for icq one time
gonna go make some lunch, brb
:) going to try it
I think theres lubuntu? or ubuntu?
AJIsAwesome: I think it was GNAA or someone else. They got into his account and told YouTube to take down his videos because of copyright or something like that...don't remember it all. Happened sometime last year
lubuntu (lxde desktop)
And I think they were targeting WoodenToaster next but I don't think it succeeded
oh I'm not familar with that one then
It was either them or some other troll group.
well that;s cruel
who is GNAA?
google it...
I guess I don't know and don't care :/
on the other hand... I have nothing else to do XD
By default its not set to make a sound from what I remember
^ that is the GNAA...
ASoftFluffyThing: Okay.
so youl have to go into your settings on pidgin
google told me its's Greater Nashville Apartment Association
hehehe nice...
ok I'll try to login on here now from pidgin
or Golden North Archery Association
Lil_B, first two links will tell you who/what GNAA is.
ASoftFluffyThing I just posted my first 2 :/
AJIsAwesome: I do believe that it was GNAA because it is ringing a bell in my head...
Okay.
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Chaos and Darkness
ohia sumica
Lil_B: Hm. Well you'll find it. The name itself is WTF
00,10ok seems the issues was my end
Hallo Sumica
00,10back on mips now
ASoftFluffyThing rdash already told me :)
what the ping said
Lil_B: Okay :3
And dat fanservice
:D
It's good now.
Sumica: Question: What's the name of this video?
Scout, get off yer iPh--ohi Pinkie
I think he misunderstood
hmmm maybe I will need a little help
This is done very well. :D
That's odd. Scout is usually friendshipping with RD.
so I set protocol to irc
typed my username and pw
and set server to www.spyrochat.com
it it right?
nice PMV
inb4 I'm feeling that this song will get darker.......
no hold on
the link is irc.epic-chat.net
you will have to join the channel #spyrochat
oh ok
I need to idle, ill be back later on, hope you can get it working :)
/me tosses a tumbleweed into chat
ok

/me chases after tumbleweed

*shrugs shoulders*
Why is the Cider gone?

/me sets the tumbleweed on fire
SirGanjalf: :D
Could go for some rum too.
well you know noone pays attention to when a mod says they're restarting, not stopping Sumica
00,10true enough
00,10they probably missed the refresh comment too
"They're taking the ponies to Isengard" next, pls
00,10perhaps I should start doing that as channle anouncments
:D
That might help people who are on other windows.
00,10only I dont know how >_>
AJ as Cartman? lolnope
Isn't it /notice?
also about the newsletter, I like the new way of picking episodes, so few episodes of season 2 get picked at all ;_;
Sumica: /notice #bronystate *message*
This song without Dash
Seems weird now
00,10yep I like the new way of doing pony ep picks
^
I'm too used to it
00,10ikr Dari
I gotta be honest, I prefer the RD version of this song
This... is odd.
I like that it's not sped up, but I'm too used to the old as hell version.
Haven't seen the RD version of this song.
00,10also seems strange to hear it at normal speed
With ponies, at least.
>haven't seen Dash you're gunna go far kid
wat
It's so old
How can anyone not have seen it?
Newfoal?
Not me. :P
00,10let us correct this eh dari?
Scoot-Scootaloo plays it almost everytime he streams
Noooooooo.
even I've seen it, and I actually don't watch many Brony Vids XD
00,10new foals cant twi force

Sumica: Yeah, good idea

I don't want bread ;___;
Too bad.

Hi

Invi no, I blame radioactivbe blood... because radioactivity -.-
SirGanjalf, why? Batman sleeps during day :D

Spectrum_Rush: :D
00,10spidey strut
Dken2021: of course!
It's set in futuristic 60's.
Well that's inconspicuus
inconspicuous*
SirGanjalf, it ws made in the 60s, and it's set in what was modern times for then.
00,10fuck da police

You spider sense is shit Spidey, no offece
Use your webs? :S

Hi Kencolt
hi Kencolt
Well, I switched up my A and B movie this times servey :/ A) Metropolis B) The Trixxer
00,10So I wonder, if this guy is so oily that webs and spidey cant hold him
00,10how can he climb a ladder?
AJIsAwesome: By the time the police got there they were just a bloody mashed pulp
A bit like the gore bags in fallout 3
:D
Von Shlick - don't know why, but that sounds nastu
*nasty
^
Haya Kencolt
hi sheep
SirGanjalf, because your mind is in the gutter maybe?
No WAY was this guy ever in the comics. TOO lame.
ASoftFluffyThing: Possible
hi
So his webs can be as hard as steel, but can't hold one dude coverd in oil?
Is that his kryponite or something?
evidence smevidence
Oil Schmoil
00,10so much wut
wait... OO7?
Universe?
.........
like in 2Os and a 7?
megalomania much?
dat pun
60's Spiderman. Common sense is optional and ignored.
that's wrong on so many mbasic levels of chemistry!
Oiloscope?!
^
>magnetic oiloscope
This show
magnetic?
Not a single fuck it gives for your logic and reality
Oh, come ON.
Wait, web hook? :S
00,10sticky oil
00,10wut
adhesive....wha?
ohey Kencolt and doctor_whooves127
Lil_B, that all there is perfectly rigt with quantum physics >.>
Lil_B: a.k.a. random "science" babble
My mind is full of oil.
hi
Break an air bubble. Wut?
YOU DUN GOOFED.
lol he is derpy too
Sumica: oil actually can be sticky... adhesive though no
Bubbles, my only weakness!
wat
but oil floats on water?
Invi nope... OO7 is still wrong even taking quantum mechanics into account -.-
Dat oil warning
:S
Wat?
inb4 explosion
00,10that looks so wrong when you eventaly catch up to me
Lil_B, the basic of quatum fluctuation: everything is possible, just very very [...] very unlikely ^^
that feel when you loose a game because you're stupid
Because you're a jerk, JJJ.
You don't say!
00,10or like refresh
Invi because you don't ever every every write down something like that as OO7, there is a set of rules on how to write a name of a Molekule, and he broke them + plus, itr'Äs NOT an Element, an element isn not based on already existing atoms!
Y U NO COVER YOUR FOOTPRINTS? :S
Naughty naughty
yeah... dat "Special Selicon" ...
yo
YES. Shoota gun new oil tanks.
spidey's been dissolved
Silicon Coating. Meaning hyper slippery. OK. How is this going to work?
congrats Blako :)
Lil_B, just 1 word: Quatumfluctuation ^^ it even is able to bend physics ^^
00,10.......how can a gas mask let him breath?
^
SO MUCH LOGIC BREAKING.
You should be able to add this channel to your list so it will automatically join this when you connect
Sumica: 60s Spiderman, thats why
How come he was just filling up his gloves and then they were suddenly in that box
good thing too is that theres no advertisements :P
Invi but not able to break simply naming rules -.-
When I was a kid, I took this kind of thing as gospel...
WAT
I think you made a comment about that a while ago..
How did you not catch him before? :S
WAIT, the oil SHOULD be floating to the top
Lil_B, it actually is if right timed and at the right place simultanously in the same way ^^
00,10ded
Oil floats if it's in water
but it was closer to safe...what da hell?
wut
dafaq
ded
but..how
00,10and spider man broke his back
Boooooo
magic mask
yup
OH GOD THE PUNS
slippery sam? :D
what did he say? COO7?
Sumica:
Booooooo

...that...hurt.
I like having it without adds and seperated from browser
And JJJ is still in denial
00,10mips is still being stupid I see
yeah
water covering the oil, yep
'/)_(\
perfect logic in here
ded
just a little for me Sumica but its cool
explosion? pft dont hurt spidey.
Hurt her. Please. Hurt her.

pretty good alexxm got class tonight so yea lol
oh, and don't forget: that show is IN COLOR
00,10dont know why they are doing so much early AM mantance
Kencolt, no. the original ones had Wax monsters, not costumes ^^
pew pew
hi bronies! :)
Hi DaringDerpy
hi brony ^^
hi DaringDerpy

00,10dis guy again
hello DaringDerpy
Hi, DaringDerpy :)
bonk
so has anyone seen the cabin in the woods
.....HOW did spiderman get on a rooftop
Invi: WRONG! I HAVE the original first movie uncut. They awere ALWAYS men in costumes-- or elaborate puppets when flying.
alexxm: great, everything as planned :) how about you?
he just stopped mid flight!
^
i'm good DaringDerpy
eeyup, even the editing is brilliant
good
00,10why is he counting the chimes
00,10he can see the numbers
Kencolt, okay then the series, you know what i mean? with Gidorah and Mothra and so son ^^
drawing smoke was too expensive
thx for your help, now I just need somehow test if the sound is working
oh dis gon bud
:=O he even lost his cigar
*gud
dat lower jaw
did JJ just solve a mystery?!
00,10god damn that guy has alot of chin
That's too bad.......FOR YOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!
Invi: Yes. And those weren't wax. Gidorah was a half-suit half puppet,Mothra was a puppet (Made of wood and cloth and stuff) and such.
Sumica, but it can't be more than Aaron Eckhart's chin, right?
Kencolt, hm okay, was Godzilla wax at least? ^^
And the Big G himself was always a guy in a suit.
god dat face
Invi wasn't godzilla a costume
WAT
alexxm, i guess not
King of the sky using a rocket? :S
Blako1
only g3.5 used less moving parts in its animation
Blako1
it works :D
Blako1 :)
00,10nice park job
Invi: Nope. But there was wax used at one point-- in the first movie they built the electric power towers out of wax, so when the G melted them, they melted by shining really bright lights on them. Quite an effect for the time.
awesome
:D
geat thx :)
goddammit jameson
np
-_(\ shut up JJ
Goddammit Jameson YOU HAD ONE JOB
"I'm a rocketmaaaaaan!"
00,10and now you know what spidey swings from
sooooo.... how much fuel does thatr ocket have?
a lot
Kencolt, ooh i recall the movies again... you are right ^^ his movement was too smooth to be wax ^^
Dark_Horst: infanite
infinite*
ASoftFluffyThing: thanks again ^_^
Yay! It works...!
00,10so how does JJJ know all this shit?
why does he know all this stuff?
...why the fuck does HE know military secrets?
Sumica: Maybe he's in on it?
he is JJJ, he knows everything
dat chin
why does a guy who runs a newspaper know this stuff
He could just shimmy away from the falling clock part.... :S
00,10JC it's a bomb
Vulture
WAT
you can break walls with that
You could drive an Appaloosian Train through the plotholes in this.

Shit, nostalgia.
Oh yes. Nostalgic feelings. This was the first G4 Pony related vid I ever saw.
It's mid-day here, so...
So if anyone is looking for something to blame for me being here, this video is it.

Meanwhile, I see your Night of Pony and raise you Avast Fluttershy's Ass
Meanwhile: i thought it was the actual show :D:D:D
apple.mov for me too
I can't remember what I saw first :/
Flyboy: Nope, bumped into this on an Escapist post near the start of the fandom.
00,10first was anthology
Mine was a YTP where Robotnik became a brony.
Think my first ep was Applebuck Season
For reasons beyond me, this peaked my curiousity.

00,10cause you like touhou?
HIYA everypony

*brohoofs screen*
/me shoots Bronysith in the shins with a cinderblock
First episode I saw was the pilot episode.
Flyboy: It's Cocktail for Two, performed by Spike Jones and his band. The original wirter of the song hated Jones' rendition, feeling it made itsilly-- but made more money off the royalties of Jones' version than the original cut ever did.
/me removes his shin bones and shoves em down Sumica s throat
/me grows back his shins
/me kidnaps Bronysith
Kencolt: what sorry?
/me breaks alexxm s neck
The not Disney thing.
my first episode was Party For One
I discovered FiM last autumn
It looked like a good cartoon and I was surprised by my lack of knowledge regarding it. And shortly thereafter I found the then current eps on youtube, and from there I found EqD, and from there I found this place.
You know, back when we actually advertised on EqD.
i found it around august last year
00,10this was the second video I ever saw
Oh god this lol

Hi SafariMonkey
did I ever show you my printed ponies?
hi SafariMonkey
http://i.imgur.com/2SyxL.jpg
http://youtu.be/BTZStx4n0xw
wow, is it expensive to print those 3D models?
ok guys, i'm off to class...see yall later tonight :)
cya
thats about a dollars worth of plastic
hey guys
Byes BladedWings. DO YOUR BINARY HOMEWORK
i shall Fluffy
not much, getting ready to head out soon
Good.
Anyone here play Crysis? (1)
the place became unregistered and was like that for a while
I saw the printed Spyro on the forum
So I ended up registering it and..well that makes me the admin for the time being :P
DeadpoolDash: Cuter than a kitten playing with yarn.
Ah, wow
I know it needs to be on a loop
There were multiple times we didnt even have a topic set here :/
and i wasnt autojoining here for a few months
so everything kind of died.
:(
I wonder if the next season is going to play every other weekend.
and all nick regs were lost and stuff
Yeah I stopped coming because everyone left
probably.
2 episodes a month. it will be rough, but better than nothing.
so all the channels I used to be in died
But we are trying to get this place back up
Cades been asking friends, Ive been doing the same
wait, how am I still oper then?
It seems to be working :)
I feel like I am addicted to drugs when I talk of new pony episodes
http://i.imgur.com/l5isZ.jpg
In fact I fail to see a difference any more.
oper of what? here?
Of the network
totally
No idea..
dunno
when did it say anything about two episodes a month
username and password still work
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTZStx4n0xw&autoplay=1&loop=1 *should* do it
Gah. I feel like bashing my head into a wall untill I loose counciousness. I hate being miserable depressed without good reason. I hate crying let alone my own fucking bull shit <<
Doesn't seem to work
lose.
consciousness*
And I just can't spell today. I give up.
I've been wanting to get the old group back together
guess he didnt change the config then
that use to come here?
just somehow channel regs got wiped
he was just here 2 days ago
Finally
DeadpoolDash: http://www.youtube.com/v/BTZStx4n0xw?version=3&loop=1&playlist=BTZStx4n0xw
I think what happened is everyone grew up :P
Some other person was here too, Ginger I think..
ah yes
DeadpoolDash: It should loop now
I saw him on the forum the other day
I was shocked
why?
hey everyone
'cause I haven't seen him since like '08
we should just turn spyroforum into a ponyforum, it would probably get more traffic.
OK gotta eat,
SafariMonkey: Yes. It loops.
/me kidnaps SafariMonkey
ha probably
hello oni_link

Lucky my new 3d printing forum is gaining popularity.
Does it still have the last 5 or so active members or did everyone leave?
on what?
SF
lots of guests with no members online
once and a while there are 3-4 people onlone
but nothing like the days when we were all young and stayed on all day and there were like 15 people online.
it still gets a fair amount of posts per day
brawr

BLOODY WANK I GOTTA GET ON STREAM
In the U.S.
...OH MY GOD.
emangamer Y'know, I'm getting the feeling you've just come off 4chan.
HEEEEEEYYYAAAAAA EVERYPOONYYY ;)
Neg is a crazy man.
he probably would have been shot
Hence with all the 'Newfag' talk.
Hey Sonny how's your comp?
If he did that in the US
If you didnt give any shits, you wouldnt respond. Clearly u mad.
hi

otakon's being kicked every twenty seconds, how old school.
we know Sonny
I love you too, Sonny <3
Woop woop
that man is damaged :D
Sonny: new here? well then welcome.
I got the feeling this site is getting as bad as 4chan - the porn
At least I know other countries like dumb things
Dark_Horst: in the best of ways
When I go to 'Murica I want to do this.
Mmhmm.
grouphug everypony
emangamer: wait what?
See how quickly I get arrested.
emangamer, it depends on the streamer.
emangamer theres no porn on here :I
Porn, on here?
ScootaChicken: you'll get shot in Texas
wat
It could be staged.
nonono otakon I knew this site for like 4 weeks now :D
man, a workshop with Jesper Kyd, Masashi Hamauzu, Borislav Slavov, Richard Jacques, Austin Wintory
dari It's because your voice is ear porn.
You streamed porn and no one told me? Well thanks.
emangamer: what are you talking about
Sonny: oh I never noticed yo9u is all
Kinky.
I'm making a new drawing now :D
ScootaChicken, pretty quickly but tell us about it
But there's no porn on this site.
- means minus /)_-
Theres no porn here, but there are sometimes lemons.
emangamer: what you on about?
XDDDDD
otakon: I'm not on that often :p
the only porn that came remotely close to being on here was Lemon stealing whores :p
If there was porn, there would be more people here
MFW we streamed more NSFW stuff earlier on in the site's history
Youtube Poops
Not later
Indeed.
So if anything it's got cleaner
anyhow, it's gonne be Dovahkiin versus aldiun >:D!!
thankfully
You and your fackin' lemons.
Oh god, Lemon Stealing Whores
wish me luck ^^
Sonny: you'll be fine
the greatest video ever made.
bye Sonny
ScootaChicken: no
apples and lemons
wait we streamed porn
Cinematic masterpiece.
So how bout them lemons eh?
alexxm: no we didn't
Mmmmm, slemons.
Since I joined in March, I saw quite a bit of NSFW stuff.
No no no, I wanna give it a go, go go....
thanks CCCP but I'm not going yet xD
Und dann everyone got the wrong idea.
emangamer: so essentially a pronless four chan?
SafariMonkey: my face when
alexxm: Google 'lemon stealing whore'.
ah
How about Wrek's pictures?
ok nvm CCCP I need to go to the toilet >_>
lol
i remember that dari
the fics
OH GOD THE FICS
btw guys
Woo, Cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger?
never heard of it
18
otakon: Oh I thought it was a mod or something
yay heroes
the only nsfw thing i ever saw on here was a few sex scences from movies =/
EIGHTEEN.
Heroes <3
YOU FAIL AT REMEMBERING.
otakon, you hadn't heard of the Foos.
CCCP: yeah thats about it
if you are here's the link
Cliffhanger? From Between the Lions?!
:)
Hello anyone who happens to be here at this moment. XD
CCCP: well, there were those scootascreamers..
ScootaChicken: not called FOOS
emangamer: but that would make 4chan... not 4chan
not the blimps!
I'll be going now
BYE
Um...
Hey
ScootaChicken: I've heard of it before though
rather, lack of itself
bye Sonny
otakon: *them
bye
We need to SEE 18.
ScootaChicken: just never called Foo's before
I think.
rage bum
ScootaChicken: NOT THE GODDAMN POINT
Besides, if this place was like 4chan wthout porn we wouldnt have nearly as many easily rear-rumptured people here like eman.
I think emangamer RQ'd.
How are you doing?
YES DARI
Nice mouse icon
SafariMonkey: I will if I ever stream a full ep of Balls of Steel
*segments
I'm kind of bored, you?
If I ever get a job, I'm going to percieve the definition of NSFW as ANYTHING that isn't 100% work-related.
http://i.imgur.com/RGO6i.gif
OK I'm out, no spoilers for me!
Bye
How long is this going to be?
bye SafariMonkey
Anti-deaf.
Bye SafariMonkey
"A man must stand on top a hill with his mouth open for a very very long time before a duck flies in"
We watching Heroes?
bye SafariMonkey
Actually I'll leave on chat
Puzzles.
I won't be watching though
bye
I'm good. Was up later than usual last night trying to get rid of bugs that were in my room though, so I'm a bit tired still.
Oh, Heroes. Okay.
the hell?
Suddenly Heroes huh?
there are always bugs in my apartment =/
clair the bear
Suddenly?
dear diary: Today, was a horrible day :(
And then
He killed the woman they both loved
Oh that's right he shot the lady.
Well, I'm moving on to Macross Dynamite 7, then.
We've had mosquitoes getting in our house lately... It was the first time I had any in my room though.
Because he's a fackin' dipstick.
ekips: Cool link (youtube tree one)
I'm still killing them from when a whole group of them invaded a few weeks ago
ew, mosquitos
the worst kind of bugs
mfw i cant start watching the stream because i know i wont understand anything iand it will spoil the show in the furtre if i want to watch it.
I had two in my room last night and I couldn't sleep until I killed them.
what are we watching?
Heroes.
>shoots someone
IS UR FAULt
SafariMonkey that came late :D
why does he go invisible if hes invulnerable
at least it's almost winter... the one good thing about winter is that it gets rid of the mosquitos
btw. Did Heroes actualkly end at some point ?
ekips: I only just finished
itd be more intimading to take all the bulelts
actually*
So they come bigger than him?
Do*
ekips: I watched to the hospital, then Balls of Steel, then the rest
somehow
Mr T?
oh heros
Yeah... It would be nice to not have them coming in the house. It's been kind of annoying, because once we get one, it seems there's always another hiding somewhere else.
yeah
I never noticed or cared about that until I actually got my own place.... at my parents' house I just left the bugs alone :P
Matto Parkaman
Dark92Enigma have you ever seen that old ecw clip where a bunch of fans throw chairs into the ring
derp?
In some ways I miss our old house, because all I got in my room were these tiny bugs that would just die on their own. The only thing annoying about those was that if I drink anything out of a glass they'd end up in the glass.
What're we watching?
Heroes
11,02DashWithRainbows: Moo o3o

My fiance was scared of it so I had to catch it myself

Check the front page.
Finally trapped it in a box and moved it towards the window after over an hour of chasing it around
I don't have anything against them unless they get too close.

Let Sylar help stop Sylar from getting to them first
Indeed. Sylar will never expect Sylar to show up!

well sylar is a nice guy, we can totally trust him
The only smart person on this show is the techno kid
Meanwhile: Ahahahaha
Me and my sister always wanted a cat

i think one of my teachers is brony
but new
same here
minus the video game thing
what makes you think that
i think im the only brony in my town
K bye then
he mentioned MLP reference in class
If we're watching Docter Who, can we have a Tennant episode? I'm not big on Matt Smith.
i say the 4th doctor
how about both
really what was the reference
as in the end of time
TWEEST
purple_squid: Dair will like you
good night everypony
isnt that the guy that played doctor soran in star trek?
pony_5719: Welcome to Bronystate. Make sure to read the rules. :)
Goodnight Maid_RainBow :)
Night, Maid_RainBow. :)
:)
Gnight Maid_RainBow
Exorcism by fire.
That is the only solution
i like him
he mentioned Twilight Sparkle name
im the only brony in my town
Yeah I just got done playing Star Wars: TOR for seven months, now I'm playing Skyrim
bah Skyrim
:P
ive asked all my teachers and they dont even know what a brony is
no one would shut up about that game for months so I got sick of hearing about it :P
must have hope
well I got sick of hearing about bronies so we're even :P
i dont wanna be the only brony on the school
The most disappointing thing about Skyrim for me was the oceans.
Yeah exactly, haha
They were pretty big, but just empty.
hope is good
They should have put in sharks, huge fucking krakens, something.
But meh.
Well seeing as how they focused more on the land in general and Skyrim isn't suppose to be known for the oceans I'll cut them a break lol
He'll just never match the sheer awesome-onity (that's right...awesome-onity) of David Tennant.
though that would have been cool
i dont now im the only brony in my town but it seems like it
just running around as a Werewolf destroying everything is enough to keep me satisfied haha
im bad at grammer
08,01whee
Whee!
08,01pony_5719: *grammar
I'm totally out of the loop with this whole Skyrim thing... Not that I care... >->

Join the club :P
for some reason I'm watching Hook

TWEEST
he needs a hug too
make more noise, they will never heard it
win
video game reviewer
They need to get Sylar so they can ambush Sylar with Sylar.
Oh.
eyup
He's a guy who makes videos in which he yells about video games
Sylar never expected Sylar to be there.
they need to invest in some cell cameras
http://i.imgur.com/h9pIu.jpg
he doesn't always yell lol he gives it a fair review :P he just yells if it royally sucks
their all dead
lol
dat voice
This part makes me cringe....badly...
08,01i'm listening to Sabbath again! \o/

free haircut yay
If he yelled all the time, I'd think that would be kinda annoying...
oh
Trolled.

Oh dear
Sylar
gg, no you showed him
Some people actualy make tons of money by doing that somehow
Life hacks
