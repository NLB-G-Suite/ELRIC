Apparently they weren't actors.
08,01Lunar_Brony: really? how can you tell?
I think they were actors
...Dari, LIES.
Hey guys I'm back. What's going on?
Paid actors
they had to be actors.
Only bad research could lead to something like that
Hai everypony
He posted his old blog
dammit
As evidence
That's a friend of his apparently
They went together
its*
maybe...maybe the woman was cosplaying as her ponysona?
genius
:)
I thought she was cosplaying rarity?
08,01well, that doesn't seem too bad
This is the supposed proof
That lady looked like a hobo they pulled off a barge.
08,01there are worse things that she could have done
Saturn: it really isn't that bad, just stupid. Lol.
oh gawd
that...is proof?
Interests: "Smoking crack and worshipping Satan"

Romney needs to bounce back from that one. Obama's striking a weak point in his platform.
he, and it really isn't that much.

Bah, I pay little attention to American politics.

I pay little attention to polotics period.
Maybe because I just don't give a damn, not being in USA to begin with.
Fair enough
Lehrer, good lord man
Just say no

hmm romney likes talking over other people
He's too polite to run this debate properly.

but since Paypal being dumb that time I can't get it..
I swear, I'm getting sick of hearing "the reason is because". That is bad English.
There were some candidates that were running on reforming the way the gov't works, to get the corruption out, but they were sweeped away pretty early.
Also, dat nick is quite accurate :3
Oh dear.
oh, is this le Blunderlands 2?
no wait
Did I hear Romney say that he's concerned about the direction America's been going in the past FOUR years?
le gasp
I think he miscounted.
is this Halo 5: Halo's Revenge?
He should have said "twelve"
nice shot
His strategy is politically unsound.
like that
Well, there's a kitty cat rubbing on my legs, begging for food.

I care to a certain extent.
while i try to use proper grammar anyway, i only care about it as long as the other person can understand correctly, beyond that imo its not that important

6_9
05thinking of streaming either some more DN3D, maybe something else or read a fanfic
is there CMC emoticons?
lol
I think fanfic
worth a try
no no i dont want a stream
05NENUDJUS: then why are you here
i still have a buffering luna on the stream!
thats why
from like 6 hours ago
lol
05jsut gona check how logn each chapter is

here we go! http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23693/This-isn%27t-my-House!
totaly SFW and stream
o noes!
or that screensho
This isn't my house only has mild fridge horror (literally)
its8
...
nopony interested?
http://derpy.me/WKxId
this one?
omfg yea!
lol
there are quite a few in that show
but still iv been here with luna on the stream buffering for 6 hours
i dont want to let go!
its all in the past now..
noo!!!
Enjoy the last moment..
it shows me good times
6 hours ago when a lot of people i knew where on
now it is just i
and buffering luna
hm..
Well, here it is. http://www.fimfiction.net/story/49494/Blueblood-Un-jerked
enjoy.
05back
05had to put on coffee aswell
sure, one sec
05lets see how this goes
05if its horrible jsut tell me
05things to improve
05etc etc
ok doki
*sniff*
o.o
0///0
05but it shouldnt be too much of a problem
omg i feel the walls closing in now
05will start after the song
http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/03/back-to-basics-how-to-code-an-html5-template/
i can feel it comeing!
05anyways hit resfresh
no
kk
you hurt me!
on the inside
Yes
bingo!
i refreshed it
yep
confirming piano
:P
for the web audio api
._.
it'll happen soon
Well, Javascript can handle the syntheziser
:O
That SHOULD be working well right?
I'll load the sound into javascript audiobuffer
Through online means but native reading
<.<
uhuh
one sec
Preload but no play from memory/audiobuff
volume is good
*and
seems fine
it'S also cheap
6_9
I got AS3 ready, HTML5 if I can, and Javascript reading time....
not bad
it was really tough at lv 5.. but i levelde fast
I thoght it was how to make use of the functions
it defines their behaviours
http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14895/Wayward-Courier for reference
gonna be interesting
Dis is gettin' goooood
Yeah
That way I solve the issues AND make it look snazzy
I can send AS3 signals that handles the Javascript
Of course, one time signals for each sound load
you're going to get random lags betwene as3 and javascript
ipc channels and all that
...
haha, yes you can
that sledgehammer
Well
The animations and code causes low latency
/me wished he was more prepared and had earphones and a rum and coke
But the code for AS3 should send during a push = Signal sent = Play this audio buffer
With no sound in AS3 it should be quite smoother
(Atleast statistically is another thing.)
I haven't done research on Latency for AS3 to Java
javascript*
both languages have milisecond timers, possibly microsecond
Cool!
Good point, I'll look it up
i'm trying to watch stream but bandwidth limit is breaking it
med-x is best-x
night NewSuper.... missed him
hmm?
1) man without coffee, and 2) Pinkie pie WITH coffee :)
awesome isn't it
its glorious
else, not bad
I just wish I had earphones because i dun wanna wake the folks
cya all
Hugs make people feel less like crap right?
Goodbye everypony
poor twilight
courlier now has the 'wheres my pants' perk
Not as in feeling like crap as in being a jerk or somthing. I feel like crap because I'm sick .-.

Hi Guys

howdh
hi
did I ever show you my printed ponies?
http://i.imgur.com/2SyxL.jpg
http://youtu.be/BTZStx4n0xw
wow, is it expensive to print those 3D models?
ok guys, i'm off to class...see yall later tonight :)
cya
thats about a dollars worth of plastic
hey guys
not much, getting ready to head out soon
Good.
Anyone here play Crysis? (1)
the place became unregistered and was like that for a while
I saw the printed Spyro on the forum
I know it needs to be on a loop
There were multiple times we didnt even have a topic set here :/
Since we didn't have ChanServ
and i wasnt autojoining here for a few months
:(
Yeah I stopped coming because everyone left
probably.
But we are trying to get this place back up
wait, how am I still oper then?
It seems to be working :)
http://i.imgur.com/l5isZ.jpg
In fact I fail to see a difference any more.
Of the network
totally
No idea..
dunno
when did it say anything about two episodes a month
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTZStx4n0xw&autoplay=1&loop=1 *should* do it
Gah. I feel like bashing my head into a wall untill I loose counciousness. I hate being miserable depressed without good reason. I hate crying let alone my own fucking bull shit <<
Doesn't seem to work
lose.
consciousness*
I've been wanting to get the old group back together
guess he didnt change the config then
that use to come here?
just somehow channel regs got wiped
kja is here sometimes.
Finally
I saw him on the forum the other day
I was shocked
why?
hey everyone
'cause I haven't seen him since like '08
we should just turn spyroforum into a ponyforum, it would probably get more traffic.
OK gotta eat,
ha probably
http://youtu.be/fdezSL4Lazs

See how quickly I get arrested.
Porn, on here?

It could be staged.
You streamed porn and no one told me? Well thanks.
But there's no porn on this site.
- means minus /)_-
XDDDDD
If there was porn, there would be more people here
Not later
thankfully

Well, I'm moving on to Macross Dynamite 7, then.
We've had mosquitoes getting in our house lately... It was the first time I had any in my room though.
Because he's a fackin' dipstick.
I'm still killing them from when a whole group of them invaded a few weeks ago

I had two in my room last night and I couldn't sleep until I killed them.

Do*
somehow
oh heros
Yeah... It would be nice to not have them coming in the house. It's been kind of annoying, because once we get one, it seems there's always another hiding somewhere else.
yeah
I never noticed or cared about that until I actually got my own place.... at my parents' house I just left the bugs alone :P
Matto Parkaman
derp?
What're we watching?
Heroes

:O
Eww... I couldn't stand that. We had a mouse in our house recently, and I was scared of it getting in my room.
Check the front page.
I don't have anything against them unless they get too close.
