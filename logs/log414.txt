hiya Calcos323
hi Calcos323
03in high school its just a status thing
Hey Calcos323 :)
hey Calcos323
How do you change a frame rate in runtime for causing a uneven syncronization with a tween, also within runtime.
Why isn't there a rule against spamming lyrics during a song ?
Hiya Calcos3232
Sumica you missed the LivingTombstone mod
then they skip BCD and 98 or lower is an F
hi Calcos323
evening everyone :)
Ping pingity ping ping ping
03because A is a 4.0 and B is a 3.0, regardless of the +/-
hey Calcos323
Umbreon

Aster because this is Queen
03so I can understand them not doing +/-
Aster: Too many kicks
ping
hi

I know it doesn't count but it would look
Basically.. "Fasten up animation" within AS3.
nice
OOooh Yeah!
03but not rounding if they're going to do straigh A/B/C? That's a bit harsh XD
03well
Aster: as long as it isn't done AFTER the song is over it's fine, but the autokick is still in effect though
03that's you being Asian

Dken2021: Sumica is making fun of this show's lazy grasp of technology.

… oh, actually, according to wikipedia it is possible
13also i do a lot of extinguishing and get a ton of assists
13but mostly i push kart
dose any one skate like skateboard i never met a brony who could skate
Shizuka: You are now best pyro.
"Degaussing, commonly called erasure, leaves the domains in random patterns with no preference to orientation, thereby rendering previous data unrecoverable"
FlareChaser..I WILL MURDER YOU WHILE YOU AND ILL HAVE Meanwhile|Zombies HELP!
This is TV, the writers don't give a shit about portraying technology accurately
Reikim most shows seem to do that ie CSI does it alot
Shamroc: Is Scootaloo soup good for your health? Not if you're the Scootaloo.
Shizuka: you push cart? you are mule?
Though it only applied to CRTs

/me rubs Ben Gay on Meanwhile to prevent his soreness
Reikim: It's catchy, but it's not anything I'll put on my MP3 player anytime soon
DO EET
otakon: I'm really not. But chargers are overrated.
What time do Scootaloos go to lunch? Twelve o cluck.
They eat themselves.
Meanwhile: and Banshee's are cheap as hell
Mind you, otakon plays a Vanguard. Sore winner, sore winner everywhere.
Scootaloo is best chicken
First the kitchen, soon, the toaster of DOOM!

I AM a geeky filly
Shizuka: Yay, another one!
Planning to play it by hear?
Shizuka then you took a TF2 to the knee
Why did the Scootaloo disappoint his mother? He wasn't what he was cracked up to be.
Shizuka, It is alright, we are a very accepting group, and most of us were just as geeky, if not, we still are geeky.
08,01so i might sheetify a complex version, and ask her to record it
Meanwhile: wha? Oh i'm sorry, we're you saying somethign?

Reikim, they DID promote Linux on their home machines and are still quite open to *real* homebrew dev. Plus, they do not b0rk their contracts with game makers too much (but *will* change their way, considering how successful Microsoft is by being an asshole to gamers)
and I mean, it's not as if the reviewer even trashed the film. She gave it a 3/5. But because that messed up the precious 100% rating, fanboys flocked to that shit like rabid, impotent chimps.
lol chimps
What movie?

Krakss: It's okay because there's consent. And it's Tali, so who cares?
Krakass: Well since aliens are sentient it's OK
Randomnerd, did you stab yourself with your chin?
This is also why I'm trying to lose weight. I was decent at 155 lbs.

im prob about 160-170
TheHoodyNinja: well that sure didnt seem too efective
Ok i let Fluttershy bite, Reikim

It's just that I'm paranoid by nature and I will suspect everyone >|

Hey, stuff is on fire. Looke for the big switch in front of you labeled fire extinguisher.
I'm Italian, we like food! lol
Om nom nom and all that.

What does killed mean in irc?
But I do know the glitch to get the Uber Monies
Someone needs help with Dead Money?
Ninjazz I know, but my research proves that his blood boiled, his brain exploded, and he would be un-recoverable, so I believe him to be a clone, not a zombie
00,10let me drop combat and you can take over Shizuka
13oki~<3

OH MY FUCKING CLESTIA.

And by research Ninjazz, I mean I watched GameTheory
Looks like I'm not sleeping to night...
kenne: oh wait, are you in the theatre?
IT TOOK ME 5 GOD DAMN MINUTES TO GET BRONYSTATE TO LOAD.
MahBoi777: yeah
Onoz
Unacceptable!
Garrus doesn't know the meaning of the word cover.
Litwick sounds awful
Litwick: At least your internet does'nt randomly cut out
sorry Litwick i fell off of the chat and it cried so much at my loss
Ryanier128: Game says he is revived... Although the very fact that his body shouldn't even exist more than dust particles. He is resurrected as himself with a few extras.
It randomly cuts out too.
What's unacceptable is a Shizu stream around Midnight on a school night
kenne: Where are you right now?
13<3
Litwick: Who's your internet serive provider? Mine's Mediacom, and they suck
Ninjazz: trying to find out where to go in the theatre, dodging all the holograms
00,10home run
I need something to hug to get the rageout of my system.
kenne: there's a door you can open to you're right facing Dean when you first talk to him
/me hugs LightTrooper105
Ninjazz I think it leaves it kinda open, doesn't it? I don't play the ME series
/me hugs Litwick.

Ryanier128: Yeah... It would be cool if they did give us an explanation as to how the hell did they beat back death. But... Video Game Logic.
Roseluck don't care, she does what she wants
why did your swear counter reset
/me hugs LightTrooper105 ^^

Sumica, I hate you so much.
DAMNIT LightTrooper105 WAIT FOR TRAPPER!
Bah curse you LimeV

03is it not working?
kenne: What is your main goal? Like which one of the things are you going after?
/me in ghost form
Ninjazz they did something like that in ME3, didn't they? The ending was botch and it forced you to grab a DLC which, thankfully, was free
What?
Fuck, I can't refresh my stream now.
o-o
find a way to disable hologram security
0,14no stream atm
03or are you pissed off for another reason :P
Ryanier128: Thing is this. I didn't play ME3 though.
I had 30s+ ping
Sumica,
I never played the shadow broker DLC and I was living vicariously through you.
0,14Shizuka's still setting up
No, I was pissed off
VNC never helps my mood
00,10Sorry, but i had to be fair to other streamers

I missed you so much
Otherwise I will slap you
MahBoi777: where in the room
03what needs to be finished?
13first, let's recap what happened last time on reboot
Mortal Kombat ftw
Hello everypony :p
What game is this?
dat Reboot
I dont have the ftp info
etc
Ninjazz well, be careful if you do. The ending is . . . ugh, should I tell you? There isn't much to spoil, seeing how you needed a DLC to unlock the "true" ending(s)
ReBoot then Beast Wars then Dog Tales?
Oh hai Resonantwaves
Hey Resonantwaves
03oh
YAY FLASHBACK
lali-ho Resonantwaves

kenne: there's a key in his safe
I left everything in /mIRC/stats
0,14Satan too op, needs nerf
Ryanier128: Don't worry about that. I've seen enough comments throughout the Internet to know that I should lower my expectations of it.
MahBoi777: i dont remember that, whats the name of the key
13npcs too op
13getting nerfed
May need to move it out of there if you get permissions b0rks
kenne: Vera's backstage key
Ninjazz yeah, basically you get to choose wether you want a red, blue, or green explosion
ponies are too op, needs nerf
Resonantwaves, welcome.
O.O
MahBoi777: FOUND THE KEY!!! YES!!!!
05,15I refuse to join this chat again until we have a patch
Ryanier128: Also, no closure whatsoever on the characters
Ryanier128: i am already excited.
MahBoi777: btw it was sitting over osme papaer on the desk
I know Xanbreon
XD
OH
what is this, ReBoot?
I can sortof hear the trixie

05,15....dude
VNC is worse
oh hi Reboot
VNC makes me rage
oh dear, the User finally won something, and that's terrible :'(
OmegaMetroidBrony: if i remember i have three blocks that i picked up in the police station
GUI is worst server admin tool
oh this HELL cliffhanger
>__>
VNC over high ping makes me rage
yes
03yeah I hate VNC
@fluttercry what?

I hate TV
Oh yeah! It's my childhood!
aww yeah, shit is getting real

TV is ok
Worst cliffhanger ever
03because of no native Linux version? :P

awww shnap
05,15I didn't even watch it and I knew what it was!
GDI all I'm gettin is a black screen w/ buffer :(
what the wha?
03what I hate about VNC is that you can only have one per network that connects externally
03due to ports and crap
0,14...timeskip?
03unless each one has its own port
We skiped ahead?
03you can have like 5 computers on one router, all with their own TV ID

13i'd like a number two combo, yessssss
I remember Black Arachnia and Cheetor having some relationship that converted BA to the Maximals. It was awesome.
Sure he has built in jet boosters that let him fly, but he wouldn't be complete without the skates
i like how they can stick a t-rex on rollerskates and with context it seems totaly reasonable
13not til season 3 Everlasting_Joy

eh, don't mind watching it
yes.
wow that is the cutest dog ever...
...Can I say Wishbone is at least...not offensive
I know right Ninjazz?
How do you get a vhs on the computer?
A while ago, someone jokes around claiming that PETA got this show cancelled, and I believed it and claimed it myself, thinking it to be real. Come to think of it, this really isn't animal abuse.
13i've done it the other way before, took a rendered video out to VNS
hey it 's the kid who saved the unicorn
vns?
CupcakeWarrior TV tuners are the first things that come to mind.
The breed of dog that Wishbone is is pretty well known for being VERY easy to train.
I always think whenever Wishbone is showing a different ending to a story, Wishbone just alters it in his mind to make it awesome to him :p
13er VHS... this torrent is all over the place though... most are DVD rips, some are ripped from a philadelphia PBS, some are VHS like this one
13but yeah this quality really is bad, if you want to switch do ask
Hello everypony!
...And it's red

What about the episode where Wishbone is Alex in a Clockwork orange and gets beaten up by homeless guys? That wasn't animal abuse?

00,10there are two stats of numbers
00,10was wondering what it was saying on that

Dat OSD
13input says the same on FMLE
00,10spiffy
Wishbone just imagines himself in the role :P
Is Clockwork Orange good?
13and that OSD doesn't look much out of place either
13i think most of them use 128k mp3
Oh yeah, Cupcakewarrior...but it's really disturbing
The movie and book
any spongebob tonight Shizuka?
13it's just this one is so bad
I've only seen the film, but the film is EXCELLENT, as are all Kubrick films

I would hate to dream about classical literature
Jack Russel Terrier
I AM MADE OF CHEESE!
what a twist!
The quote I choose to write about is at the end of Canto XXVIII, when Bertran de Born says "Because I cut the bonds of those so joined, I bear my head cut off from its life-source, which is back there, alas, within its trunk. In me you see the perfect contrapasso!" This quote is meaningful because it explains to the reader the concept of contrapasso, which we already knew was an important theme in Inferno. Howeve
0,14check please
03darn it
03where did that cut off
dat terrible acting
03but I just wrote that BS now XD

13dat sneeze X3
0,14i'm jelly of Nathaniel
lol
Helloooo
Helloooooo
Totally thought Nathaniel suffocated in his sleep...that woulda been dark and awesome
03However, not only does he mention the word, but he EXPLAINS it. Bertran de Born (according to the notes) is accused of causing Prince Henry's rebellion in England, and thus metaphorically "cutting bonds" in the royal family. Dante then goes on to explain how Bertran de Born's punishment is to have his head cut off, similar to how he cut the "head" off the English monarchy. It's a very peculiar example to use, but
NOAH WAYH!
no shit!
11,01Hey.

do you?

If Discord had a son and took him over, like, with magic, and he was a GOOD pony, living in ponyville, what would be the best way to creep in the discord voice, whilst still keeping the son's normal voice, e.g: making the voice degrade more in to Discord scene by scene, whilst keeping the character voice of the son?

"vomitarium" was just a word for a small corridor
no vomitting actually occured there
Ninendo is selling the 3DS console at a loss but expects to sell it for a gain later this year.
just a common misconception
Enforcer is best rifle
but the orgies were still real orgies right?
A 3DS Lite or another price drop seems unlikely this year.
OrangeFrosting: yes, the orgies were orgies. The orgies did involve vomitting.
the ps vita need a price drop

13it's elsewhere in germany that donut is known as a berliner
:D
just like how you can't get a Boston Creme Donut in Boston

Ikr.
oh snhap
ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff jersey shore...
well any reality show :3
hahahahah
oh sorry "Reality"
Ninjazz but she looks these stupid law shows in the afternoon xD (irony?)

d3rb: that probably isn't healthy - you might want to see a doctor...
/me is actually from Jersey
/me eats cheese.
Invi|ghost: People today just don't have good taste in television anymore.
I hate reality TV *shudders*

Jersey Shore = everything wrong with the world today

yeah i know, i almost died after seeing a mere 10 seconds of the show
^TRUTH
d3rb: haven't seen it, don't plan to...
Ninjazz people today have don't have good TV shows anymore, but still watch TV ^^
Which show? :<
i had to see it just to see what all the fuss was about. jersey shore XAX
Oh. Jersey shore?
Jersey muther fucking shore
Lol
Do you know just how ironic it is that my dad teases me for liking Ponies but he is completely fine with watching Jersey Shore?
I refuse to ever watch that, merely from what I've heard about it.
i basically only watch 3 tv shows
Mlp Castle and the voice
thats it
/me doesn't watch TV.
XAX, just watch a LITTLE bit of it, just so you know how stupid it is.
^
im sorry but people that watch AND enjoy Jersey Shore... should be euthenized...
/me no offense Ninjazz but your dad isn't ready to be a true man...
I don't watch TV in general. NOTHING plays on TV here that I wanna watch.
lmao xD
My TV only serves for the purpose of running my PS3.
I don't have a TV...
XAX do you know N24? xD
Spectrum_Rush: You don't know how much I want him to know that.
Ninjazz /)(\

XAX: for bleach it was probably when they did the zanpaktou story arc... which was retarded
Daayuum!
Shirtless_Tempest: I'm presuming you watched it in jap, and not the engrish dub?
hmmm now i regret drinking that coffee earlier.
XAX: well duh... i dont watch anything dubbed
>.<
:O why would you, Digitalis?!
Coffee is most delicious.
idk, lol
/me grabs Digitalis and shakes her like a can of soda. RANDOMNESS!
yeah it is, thats why i drank it
coffee is nectar of the gods
it isn't coffee, it is energy!
Nuuuuuuuu @.@
Funny. They only just got up to the Alternate Zanpakutou arc in the English dub recently:
don't shake meh
^_^
/me pours coffee all over Digitalis
YOU NEED MAOR!
but its so much fun
AHAHAHAHAHHA
:D
lol
great. now I'm soggy, thanks.
._. srry
I'm sick of waiting for new episodes in English. I might just watch on from where I am up to in Japanese :<
^^
you can use my unworn shirt to dry off Digitalis
Apparently it's a million times better in jap anyway
>.<
dis is old but i loled http://www.ponibooru.org/post/view/53079
I find that dubbed anime usually sucks, though that is not always the case.
XAX: well, the show is now over too you know
Mhmm

Yep!
Y U NO LEVEL YOUR SKILLS LIARA?!
Surprised me too.
yeah it did end

Well then... That one is out of order...
Elevators in VI controlled buildings. http://derpy.me/zuuEU
no shakespeare stuff at all?
wtf
wtf...
One of the main reasons i enjoy being part of the Brony society (apart from obvious love of the show) is that everypony in this fandom abides by the "love and tolerance" rule. Everypony is so nice, theres no hate and all opinions are welcomed. If﻿ the world was more like the Brony society, there wouldnt be any wars, everything would be fine. That is why i am proud to be Brony!
Legit my ass...
We're doing one of his comedies
ofna01: hear hear!
Dat wall of text.

Teacher didn't even say which one

Come here, ofna01.

Stand Alone Complex.

Iago is amazing
the films are excellent

He can actually make that sound with his mouth?
Jesus.
I'm about a 6th into Hamlet
Everytime you post a line I lag and end up typoing

this DLC is FUCKED UP
Does he kiss his motherboard with that mouth?
badumtss

/me probably needs to see thestream for this to make sense
Atleast Ghost did research. The other haters didn't even do one single research.

Sumica : Sparkle armor
Twilightlicious Armor :P

Thank you, Meanwhile.

David looks unhappy.
Sumica: dont you have heavy weapons for exactly this sort of thing?
He's ganna feel like David after Dentist.
why would you want two English classes o.o
David is pretty creepy looking.
actualy i just want to see what the missle launcher looks like
i have to go to the hospital next week for about 3 hours
cus' units
anyone know what i can do?
lol
and there's nothing else to do
For you're mother, ofna01?
your*
no
not unless I want to do something crap like studies of religion
or do 13 units
i have to get blood taken.
Ahhh.
thats not so bad
wait what blood
i hate needles
ofna01: what for?
Are you squeemish?
Ew sor
im really off the growth scale for my age
/me shakes violently when having blood taken...
units? o.o
Oh well that's pleasant.
thats it..?
That's David?...
so they wanna make sure i dont have some kind of disease.
oh my hes nacked
:o
thats david
No wonder he went insane...
dont kill david
This is just creepy
It's only saving grace is that I have an awesome teacher, and it's not all preachy on us
.-.
He is a torso...
i hate needles
/me shivers
Drf, we need to fill up 12 units of classes for years 11and 12, with each class having a different value
"it"? :P
/me comforts ofna01
im the same
o.o
i get panic attacks around needles...
For example, adv English is two units
its ok ofna01
ours was just, 6 classes per semester
core ones like math/science/English were both semesters
No DickShep option?
I'm not afraid of needles, but only just the feel of it. When I was sewing, I got poked by a needle accidently
needles not so bad
Most people end up with 6 classes anyway.
10 for year 12 Drake
I have 5 classes or something
or maybe 6
Oh
actually yeah 6
eng adv, eng ext, SDD, Music, SoCul, Maths, Maths Ext
so there aren't pre-defined class periods?
U shouldn't have done that...
that's 7 actually
But it's just shiver-y when you get poked
Watching this dlc play out makes me feel like I've missed stuff in Me3.
Ext English, adv English, mathematics, ancient history, add and itv

MysticLugia, that's the solution
Boxing.

Foxy Boxing?
Shepard, do a barrel roll!
tbh just find some random script on hawkee and figure out how to get it working from there
Okay, correct me, there's a TIMELINE not universe. My bad.
after you learn what things do it's easy
stop asking me for everything
it's not how you learn

Okay, I forgive you. :)
05he likes everyone, and frankly its gettign annoying

05licks*
alexxm and Twi_Fi sitting in a tree, l i c k i n g, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes tentacles from everywhere
this is what happen when you love people to much
Wrek you use SAI right?
I was in a cheese tree earlier in chat.
wait what Twi_Fi
I can offer no real explanation for that.
05yes.
therefor i never hug ,lick,huggle or anything like that
I was trying to hide from being poked so I climbed a tree, which happened to grow cheese.
what?
Wrek|Observing: would you have any recommendations For a Starting artist?
Sumica no more Armor piercing rounds?
DONT DRAW NAKED GIRLS
thats a given
Well, I'm glad everyone is doing fine.
sumica is getting his flank kicked
Yes. Yes he is.
but this is probably on insanity isnt it
Seriously, I had like 10 people asking me for help.
actually if you are drawing humans, using artistic nudes is helpful
Wrek|Observing: like programs to use if SAI is to advanced
Sumicas PLOT is going to get killed
Meanwhile, why dont you like Trixie?
Because she's an annoying douchebag.
you're still under fire
Poor Trixie.
i used artrage 2.6 for my painting
GLITCH!!!
But dude...
you're taking fire on occasion is the only thing i can think of sumica
Thats mean.
yay
As always, my name isn't Nicewhile.
some of the bullets looked like they were above your cover sumica, so maybe it was counting it as hitting?
Sumica was in cover
its not anything to fancy but better than that Windows Paint right ?
like i want to draw but i also wanna vector things
the smae happend to me in ME 1
what gun is that?
I feel I should mention that there is somepony who occasionally comes on here by the name of Trixie.
the rifle looking one
ugh, we're talking about taxes LOL
tired
I wanna sleep
yes there is and he is a molester
So, much confusion can commence as to which Trixie is being talked about.
02pls go to sleep then x3
hay everypony
MOLESTER
moin eightbitpony
dont forget TGPT
Ship all the Trixies with Meanwhile
hello
Sumica Demanding Biatch issnet she?
All of them
Hello eightbitpony.
05i got pinged
05say again?
/me clonks RX-78-SweetieBot with a cinderblock.
>:3
again with the barriers?
why used a cinderblock?
*too
I like the way cinderblock sounds.
Go to bed noob
dishwasher_EXTREME: Meanwhile has a private relationship with the cinderblock, so they do these kinds of things together
1 second, I gotta watch this Youtube video...
again...why cinderblock
Thanks Wrek|Observing, :)
would you have any recommendations For a Starting artist? Wrek|Observing
if im not buggin you that is
/me can't draw.
sound?
05practice practice practice.
/me is sad by this fact.
05you cant draw snouts? focus on them
05suck at drawing cloth? focus on that even more
its too bad they made adepts more of a biotic nuisance rather than a biotic god like they were in me1
hey you guys should really watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw
ugh cloth is a bitch
in me2 i mean
/me know that feel Twi_fi hugs
Twi_Fi
which reminds me... i have to do my lessons before my school ends up sending me a letter.
05ive come to realize a great analogy. If art was a skill in fallout. talented peopel would just have 40points when they start rather than the default 20. but you still need practice to reach 100.
lol, video game analogies about real life are always the most effective
....Genius.
greater words have never been spoken
Idk I think Einstein said some greater words.
anyone watch it yet ?
okay gotta go guys bye
Wrek|Observing: thx, wat about programs to use i mean if SAI isnt good for a begginer,last question
Seeya fla...gone.
05how do you think i got good at hair and eyes?
Sumica Moved Luna :(
05i practiced them
05right now im tryign to get cloth right
05so i practice that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw
fortunately for you wrek, ponies dont wear clothes, unless its kinky saddle time
05dishwasher_EXTREME: no link during streams
05image links are an exception
Ingwaz: oh u

DAT PLOT

Have a season 2 survey: http://derpy.me/ZRRUL
Hi, goodmornig everyone
The Project. Because they had no one in charge of naming it.
Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
Good morning everypony
Allo Litwick.
dishwasher_EXTREME, yeah I lol at a couple of parts.
hi
Hi Litwick.
hurry up and do it already
Morning Litwick
lol I'LL KILL U WITH A TRAY
Sumica: space magic, and now its legit
2 days?
so this game is 2 days from me3
Pfft. "2 days?! I gotta get to Walmart!"
What.. is this? xD
BUM BUM Morning of the Second Day
dishwasher_EXTREME, I liked, "This isn't a game of 'who the f#@k are you?'"
jeff vader
48 hours left
ekips yay
shepard is not the brightest...
Take him down to China town!
Lol.. why not point a gun at someone.. and then just let your eyes wander all over the place? xD
airpuff like this? 6_9
Ahaha, She just didnt know what went wrong right? xD
someone sneaking up on you sumica
05curse this poll for including worst episode
05I cannot pick
I choosed The Mystertious Mare Do Well
and then shepard died
the cycle continued
Mysterious*
=O
indeed Wrek|Observing, and i think the question about season 2 being better is a bit flawed. i think season 1 and season 2 were about even in awesomeness
Glitch in the system.
Lazarus 2.0?
season 2 seemed to experiment
Why not watch Lesson Zero?
Sumica: your eyes are messed up man
Love that episode. =o
Shepard PAWNCH
Phase4-: yeah, season 2 was definitely different from s1, but it was quite good
ohgod
/me thinks season 2 is better
we started talking about domestic violence
Agreed.
Phase4-: i think theyre equally good for different reasons
anyway, got a 10 min break before next class
I loved em bouth xD
05I am 100% satisfied with season 2.
^
i miss season 1's random pinkie pie songs, which were awesome!
i liked both seasons
I like ponies.
Season 1 was good. But not as good as season 2 imo.
Indeed, Meanwhile
05I got what I expected, I ask nothign more from it.
i dont know...all of my favorite episode r in season 2
/me just barely stops from making a meanwhile x trixie joke
no mele for robots
Indeed, Wrek
S2 did experiment with quite a lot, what I noticed most were better animation details, shading, and facail expressions. Watch the first few eps from S1 and compare - huge difference
Some parts about season two is just unbeatable though
boom
Discord Arc was just fantastic xD
lol Wrek|Observing, i think we got a bit more than we were expecting, the finale was way more than i expected
those eyes
I was worried the finale would suck.
Sumica: put your glasses back on
i must have rewatch the finale like 20 times its awesome
838 words now
Your galaxy is in sight
i still wish the finale had gone in to a bit more of detail on pony lore regarding alicorns
though thats pretty much just 44 words
lol
What are you writing about?
urgh I hate essays, bro
...a hangman game called Hanging With Friends
sounds legit
perhaps in season 3 Ingwaz
:P
/me hugs Sumica
05sure some episodes gave more than expected of them. finale being one of those. but if i start expecting that. then thats not fair for the writers.
about a book called Emma and a film called Clueless
Fun
doing some appropriation crap
Sounds like BS
Very true.
I expect perfection, always.
To what extent has the composer of the contemporary text appropriated the ideas and values contained in the earlier text to say something new?
so you're writing about how you're Clueless about Emma?
/me runs
indeed Wrek|Observing, i was just saying that they definitely did the finale right
lmfao
NS is well into emma mate
*wink*
Hello everyone! :D
Hello Ghollghost.
right now my only hope for s3 is they continue as they have been and make it 26 episodes instead of just the possible 13 we already know about
LOL
twi_fi you must expext disapointment next to perfection
hey Ghollghost hows your day been
Ingwaz: they didnt realy characterize cadence differently to any other character
if its 26, i will probably joygasm
Don't forget to complete the Season 2 survey: http://derpy.me/ZRRUL I'm very curious to see everyone's opinions
it'll be 26
Really Phase4-?
indeed Phase4- which is why i would like more info on pony lore, so we can tell how celestia and cadance are different
02huh? ah idc
well i was thinking that alicorns could be a result of inbreeding in royal families.
its late now bye guys see you tommorow
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, yes, I know. That's why I become depressed quite easily.
Just fine thanks alexxm, drinking monster energy all day long <3 yours? :)
good Ghollghost
somepony_else: i think inbreeding probably has no place in mlp
Radu: lets say cadence was a unicorn. what changes
Oo i didnt know about this survey =O I'll take it now
Bye dishwasher_EXTREME.
except for the one scene where she uses her wings
twi_fi then you should aim for the better not to perfection
cya dishwasher_EXTREME
by the way where does cadence come from
infact twi calls her a unicorn more than once
I think with the following the show has gained this season, the show will continue beyond season 3's projected 13 eps, Hasbro isn't going to end the series while the running's hot
Honestly, I don't think Luna ever used her horn
just compare it to royalty in europe... almost everyone is related to everyone else... this thing seems to have been quite common in the past
TheGreatAndPowerfulT, lol, I have been told that by so many people, I have gotten better at not being so black and white.
Cypresswolf: that would be the logical thing to do, i just hope that hasbro does the logical thing. companies have shown me their thinking is not always logical
is cadence luna's daughter
Nah^
You're tearing us apart Sheaprd.
dishwasher_EXTREME: nope
Sumica: you're a biotic, you dont need your gear, you have your mind
Meanwhile: /)
Phase4-: (\
so who is she
i heard the 13 episodes were just what was ordered at the start of season 2 Cypresswolf
So how does being a biotic work exactly?
Cadence is a princess. It's like asking who Kate would be
pyro wants a hug!!
dishwasher_EXTREME: *shrugs* not luna, she was around when twi was a filly
Implants that allow them to manipulate mass effect fields.
In a nutshell anyway
i think you mean wasnt Phase4-
i did
Now this begs the question, what are mass effect fields?
*derp*
05if you ask me it was originally intended for luna and celestia to be the only alicorns. but with the whole candence thing i think was jsut to get some toys out originally.
so celestia have other sisiter
Twi_Fi: theyre dark energy fields used to raise, lower or shred
Hasbro's been pretty cool so far, I still have yet to here of copyright infringement claims when it comes to fanmade customs of their .... whatsitcalled...
sister
Twi_Fi: The basis for technology in the ME universe, stemming from the Mass Relays.
Wrek: thats my other guess, they made here an alicorn later to sell toys
