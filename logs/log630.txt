If they're really recent and bad, expect RiffTrax

Some moveis need to be riffed or mst3k.
Or if they're critically acclaimed like Harry Potter and LoTR
woke up and watched random snippets toward the end

Hello random woman we don't know.
Dawdler. Yea I'd be pretty pissed if I was named that too.
This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen.

She said Bra cast.
"all these horrible creatures in my head, and stuff"

the problem with rifftrax is that they do all kinds of movies, not just really bad ones
HAHAHA-HAHAHAHA
WHERE HAVE I SEEN HER FROM!?
Foreign? Really?
Nah, Rifftrax just isn't my kind of humour.
lOL somebody gifted it!
Too many references.
04Was it Calgon?
04Oh
04No
Calgon takes you away
MST3K is definitely esoteric
Too many random replacements of lines.
This is where the fish live.
Washing machines live longer with Calgon~
It doesn't feel linked to the movie.
00,10can we just toss them in the ocean again?
their twilight one
was hilarious
04"What if I learned how to act?"
"line"
"line"
Now, if they spent their time making fun of how bad it actually is, then that would work for me.

No, you'll just die.
Keanu Reeves is not a good actor to mimic
That's totally normal. Happens all the time during hypnotism. :P
GET THE TANKS!
We can totally out run it!
So...that was pointless
I quite liked it
00,10so um, how is this snake able to just show up?

Kind of sad.
Dude where's my snake.

00,10he lives!
and people have the nerve to call her a background pony
to the point where people now actively HATE the episode over the editting and whatnot.

THIS mess is just ridiculous
Eyeup.
Just like my career.....I'M. ACTING
I think "mess" is an apt word

Luna does nothing but sleep

It has musical numbers.

IT'S A TRAP
Oh dear.
There no heroes. They are letting innocent people die. They are lettting the innocent die!

"I'm expositing right now in case some people still don't get it"
04Yes, rifftrax is really saving this film
meh, rifftrax is putting me to sleep as always..
"just in case the audience doesn't know what's going on anymore"
They spent 70 million on this movie, and grossed 53 million... Fail
to be fair
Suddenly Episode 1 flashbacks
by the last 20 minutes of transformers 2
05,15Mann co?
Oh look there are our "heroes"
MANN CO.!
that's 1 kill
some exposition would have been nice
Yeah, but you don't watch Bayformers for plot.
How did they get in the underground
instead of that contrived "run through the desert" scene
is this commentary live?
lol
Don't bring logic.
Their**
also why are they still bothering with anything less than explosive ordinance and the like? Running around with machine guns at this point is laughable
If you are watching Bayformers for plot you are sadly misguided.
http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ngz1yCjk1rfqf4io1_500.png

How are they MISSING?
Distinguishes it from every other iteration of Transformers.
AIM FOR THE HEADS
We need Spartans!
TERRIBLE AIM
Cloverfield reference
Explosion?
and the Bulcos SHOOT FIREBALLS
my biggest problem with bayformers isn't the lack of plot or the overabundance of explosions
I AGREE!
There's that too.
the transformers are just set pieces
Blow up all the Cars!
also
Should have axed Witwicky after the first movie.
>shia labeouf
HOW DO THEY KEEP MISSING?
Headshot
:D
and ofc it HITS THE HELMET
FBI good or bad
and the creature is fine
one thing I'm enjoying is that atleast the military is actually effective
BOOM HEADSHOT
My thoughts on the third movie are thus:
Our heroes everyone, they run away and let innocent people die.
also, WHY ARE THE SOLDIERS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE GODDAMN TANKS?
lawl at korea
Way to fucking go:|
weird. The movie is now louder than the riffs.
:D
Seriously, stand BEHIND THE TANKS
05,15Wihelm again?
WILHEML
WILHEIM!
:o
But NK made Pulgasari
bye bye LA
That third being anything involving LaBoeuf and his retarded girlfriend.
also, ONE Wilhiem scream per movie!
like, the army of mummies charges an artillery line
and vanishes
lol
Bulcos
Maybe they should have used the tanks against the dragons and the helicopters against the ground army.
Cuz it's predictable.
to much CGI in the way
Is this movie banned after this? :D
We're bad
huh, what's going on now?
the weird thing is
oh shit the movie remembered it had a plot it was supposed to be following
kamikaze helicopter
i don't know.
labeouf can be a good actor
they are the MIB?
how far are we through the movie?
I really genuinely liked him in Holes
First 45 minutes of Transformers 3: Shia Lebouf looking for a fucking job.
LaBoeuf? Good?
Oh, Holes.
About 20 minutes left
That was good.
i knew it was the FBI
The Rifftrax is not banned but the real movie is.
Soooo... how come the government dosent have any other viable paranormal soulutions? :/
Idiot

Remove the aliens, rework the plot, presto! problem solved.

Mordor!
YOU CANNOT SURIVE A FUCKIN EXPLOSION
We're in Mordor suddenly
And now they're over there now.
05,15SARAH

Oh, OK. Still not a great film, but nothing to be horribly ashamed of like if you meant this
I warned every pony it was terrible. :D No one listened!
I listened. :P
seeing as we can't find a proper copy of this movie, I'd say this movie WMC'd itself.
Best Boy Grip?
mmm
Just sawe that in the credits
>Special Effects Coordinator
That Zookeeper was sadly the only thing good about it.
>Edward Surkis you should be ashamed
NP.
although I admit, I fell for the "brother did it" ruse
I hereby motion that the non-Rifftrax D-War be put on the WMC list. All in favour?
Sure seems like it some time
Aye.
Man....
yes
also it had great credits music
Agreed
00,10now now, this movie did have two good parts

The fandom likes them way too much.

HATRED
http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/16674
I'm pretty sure celestia is older than that
Luna and Trixie. Kneejerk against the fandom's use of them.
Actually, the fandom's rather split on trixie
They have their place, I like them, but the fandom...
she is over 3000 yrs old
Guess I should remember my MST3K mantra. :P
<.<
and poor applejack has less fans than background ponies
Famine is cannon
She's arrogant and stupid and deluded. No she does not have any redeeming qualities. No she is not pathetic. No she is not a Woobie.

Fuck I'm sick of seeing that.
I want to see a fic where Trixie is a delusional jackass.

She seems more of a 'Sesnirp' to me
it'll come up in time
R34 COMMUNITY WAS RIGHT!

Here it comes
Celestia plays more of an important role than her, and yet I don't see people clamoring to see an episode about Celestia, unless it involves Luna somehow.

I think it's becasue they see Luna as the atoner

I've always thought Earth ponies would make good Druids and Geomancers.
but it'll probably never happen
IT'S THE WINDIGOS

well that was fun
Bye
bye
moar
yep
damnit done
First thing it does to the timeline: Equestria was founded during some sort of period where the Princesses aren't present.
the biggest thing it establishes is that Equestria wasn't founded by Celestia and Luna
Later Gho....
^ Exactly.
/me moves like jagger
YOURE BANNED
Well, that was a nice movie night, I guess.
I'd like to apologize for my attitude regarding the B-Movie.
ETF IS THIS
Oh this! :D
Yes SFM Jagger
:D
And yet, they are on the flag, but that could be construed as an anachronism as a result of the retelling.
It was wrong of me to complain about the manner in which it's presented.
lolwut
YOURE BANNED!!!
If it isn't, then that means that they endured as a kind of myth for a while.
This movie is banned.
05,15and then everyone got banned
LOL
Now, this story may have taken place during one of two periods.
which means there's at least a certain period of time where Equestria wasn't ruled by Alicorns. Opening up a lot of questions on how the government operated before the Duocracy we see now.
this is disturbing
Oh no I was banned!
I must depart, take care everypony!
Post-Discord Pre-NM, or Post-NM and Pre-Mane6.
bye
oh this
Nuuuuuu! I'm banned! :'(
then the RPS

*dark92
ZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUL
and they showed up after Equestria got founded
Season 3.
Then again, seeing as Twilight herself knew about the bells, it's possible Pony History is accurate going way back, and Luna just has an interest in history.
THIS IS NOT 12
FOURTEEN
lol
Yes, that's his real voice.
good plan
What's the puffball pony?
Possible, but I think it's more likely that Luna knew about Starswirled.

...Wow.
DAT FLOPPY
damn
XD
Look upon my headcanon, ye fanboys, and despair.
FLOPPY DISK
I'm beholding it
Those are Floppy Drives, right?
Wait...the floppy disks are the colors of the ponies whose phrases are on them.
and honestly it could work
I like the customized one.
FLOPPY.PIE is cutest floppy drive! :O
HOW
Possible contingent theory: Celestia partially planned for the Mane6.
FLOPPY drive, not hard drive
I remember floppy discs that were actually floppy
GENIUS!
rightright, -5 nerd points
Meh, I personally go >Equestria founded >Discord >RPS show up >Discord Beaten >RPS Rule >NMM happens >Celestia rules for 1000 year >Mane 6
Works too.
and yes they are called FLOPPy drives not hard drives, its just a term that wont die out
Wow
inb4 Tirek returns
Anyway
ANYWAY
Okay then
i bet saturn would know
Thats happening
00,10just a midi controler
There's software you can download to do this yourself. It's an easy to pick up hobby.
00,03Sumica: American version?
I remember floppy disks and diskettes
Also I'm not going to bare with you, that's just weird.
Um hello, everpony
I want a Pinkie Pie floppy drive
it is, and seems like a lot of thinking anyway
i see no one got it
Why? She loves her sister.
And
thats great really
Awesome.
YES
AHM BLUE
YES
that was awesome
YES
DA BA DEE DA BA DAI
dabuu dee
Now we have SD cards with 32 gigs
BLUE
I think
This is Blue by Eiffel 65
LOL.
Perhaps it was the conflict between the two sisters - I believe it's said that Luna/Celestia used to be co-wielders?
Well, more like a ponified remix of Blue
:( um i like it very much
yeah
Either that or Celestia intenionally DC'd herself.
Well, Celestia was at least connected to the EoH during the 1000 years, even if she couldn't use their full power.
I'm pretty sure Tia wasn't in harmony when she had to face her sister
creepy shiz
ok this is kinda creepy
I know it from my childhood!
YES!
00,10FlutterPie is blue
Blue, by Eiffel 65
Oh yeah, I forgot that.
Neither of those ponies are blue... :(
This is yet another one of these 80s songs.
Okay, i get it...
the fact that Tia imprisoned her, rather than turning her back to normal, also implies that they weren't at their full power when she used the EoH
:D

About.... 1 hour till its sept here

Harmony holds the universe together.

Agreed Tennant is the best
Yes, blame it all on the house old man
The old man!

The OLD MAAAAAN!!!! D:
ZOMBIEEEES
:D
anarchy!
00,10you can auto compleat names by typeing a bit then hiting the tab key till it fills the name in

I got to check when it is:P
this show seems pretty fucked up :DDD
Jk.
00,10besides HubNetvvork said it starts the 22
Hmmm
no source, I won't believe you
really the 22nd?!
src or it didn't happen
Wait...but EQD said 8th
Could be wrong however
Didn't eqd accidentally put up another rumour?
Lol
22nd?! 8th?!! dont play with my mind?! D:
08,01so excired about monday
BBC low budgets haha

Saturn http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9ndv7a58O1ru3r25o1_500.png
The old seasons had bad actors
i can go through!!
Goodbye creeperhugger
00,10clames sep 8 th
Yeah
Warning to all ignorant ponies; The release date for seasons 3 still has yet to be announced. Also, when you hear a date from someone, DO NOT BELIEVE THEM RIGHT AWAY. Ask for source, analyse those source.
00,10I ihghly doubt they would start eps next week with out a single ad showing up on the hub.
00,10seeing as it's become the flagship show for them
00,10they would probably have at least 2-3 weeks of play up for the eps
They could have re-worded that.
suddenly evil
Damn, I thought they were good guys
Suddenly derp
they even changed their color to evil
I'm gonna get drunk waiting for this Season to start.
brb
EEEEEEEEVVIIIIIIILLLLLL
wibbly wobbly
plague zombies
like in RE?
yes
00,10like I said I fully expect 3 weeks of play up for it
meeeh I saw that too many times
I did, until I manned up and read it in full.
EQD is beyond unprofessional
the post I read said exactly the same as we did here
but they might have posted just the zap2it before, I don't know
can't believe that people are considering photoshops
Lol.
I'll laugh if it starts in October. :D
O, sed nos scimus :$
I agree more luna
I wanna see more ponies period
well said
the borked episodes were included on s1 dvd
they drove him mad
keeping her around sure, but less pop references is good
their balance now is good
only 13?
where do you have this 13 times thing from?
They made it clear in the old series
he can only be reincarneted 12 times. He does have 13 "lives"
00,10you missed by a bit dr
Oh, no wait
00,10it's not 12 hr, it's a year and 12 hours
Is this the ep where he overshoots
happens
well that was awkward
just a tad
Damn, I thought this was BADWOLF
00,10lolwoops
00,10the start of badwolf hinting
oh Ecklson why couldnt you star for more then just 1 season
The Doctor's personality DOES change with each regeneration, right?
Yes
As does his age
appearance
likes and dislikes
all
dat spamkick
just travel back 12 months...
lol
Might as well restart now
Why can't they just go backward?
he has no idea how the tardis works
he stole it
Dem airhorns
lol at dat sound xD
in one episode, the criminal woman told him that the tardis sound is actually the handbrake...normally it shouldn't do such noises
spaceairhorns are best horns
00,10tSparx, the tardis takes 7 to drive it properly
Really? And he doesn't like the idea of bringing an entire family onboard the TARDIS?
00,10yep
Kk
00,10that is why he has a hard time landing where he should
He stole the tardis from a museam as the current tardis is a older model
If a crew of 7 is proper for the TARDIS, then bringing an entire family onboard would be the most appropiate thing for it.
Well he would need to teach them and that just wouldnt be fun XD
tvception
00,10more or less.
00,10they can help but realy it takes a time lord to drive it
They can its just its complicated

Lawl no.
Smith is a bad actor.
...
oh boy here we go
00,10ohhi dari
don't fall for the bait
that....is totally not creepy
I think both Tennant and Smith have both good and ad momments. I eally like alot of the earlier Tennant episodes, but in the end, especialy the last few minuttes, he got a bit too emo for my taste
NOT CREEPY
dabi

isnt that the point dari
Different

00,1011 actors
00,10one actor was a movie only
thats is pretty cool never seen a serios like that before
00,10this one only lasted one season
00,10yeah
That was one of the points that made it for me for ecklson
Hanging with the blonde
when he says sorry to the secretary
Yea he was at times however when he got into the more darker emotional points he was very good
Tennant kept the audience entranced with his personality creating not a single dull moment.
Rowan Atkinson again
movie?
passwords...
Ooh Pat Stewart'd be good!
yeah
sport relif?
relief*
again sport relief?
BADWOLF?
"I need my vicodin " :D

Right after Rarity mentions not wanting to lay on the grass, Rainbow Dash lays down on the tablecloth
