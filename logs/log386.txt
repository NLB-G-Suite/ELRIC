The new My Bad sounds as if Derpy did it on purpose.
brb
It's definitely clear that the new voice was done very quickly, with no thought to acting. The voice itself is okay but...the VA obviously wasn't getting anything from the director.
dos eyes

Woah, ive never seen Cowboy bebop this nice before O.O (my comp screen is nicer than my tv)

Martial Arts is a metaphor for Friendship
yep
yay
definitely
*clap clap*
00,10so I take it you all want more.
But yea, Tovler's right. The "my bad" line sounds like she's almost mocking RD about it.
Si
um yes plz?
YES
Of course Sumica ^^
MOAR COWBOY BEEBOP
MMOOAARR
Show them the greatness
Seriously, How are all of you happy during a crysis such as this?
hiya yay
*applauds*
Anybody listen to Akeboshi?
This is gonna turn into a "Han Shot First" kinda thing, isn't it?
whats the sound for ponies clapping
yay
u hear me Sumica?! MOAR BEEBOP!
All right, I'm going to head off folks. Despite the bad news, thanks for making my night.
Jaketehsnake: we have to be, bc worrying about it will do us no good.
Whats the sound of one hand clapping?
Well, okay, Sumi.... since I know you don't have one of my all time faves.
i heard a yay
yey
00,10Jake, cause we all kind said all we have to say, and it's only itunes version.
Night Everlasting_Joy sleep Well
Not to mention, worrying about it is silly.
Jaketehsnake: we just move on, and it's not the end of the world or the fandom
it's just really disappointing is all
Ah, I missed the disctussion then. Ah. Carry on
Thanks TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
Sumica: thanks for the stream man
It's one small thing which will just stay like that. "A small thing"
woohoo
Besides, she was called Derpy in the original version, so it will be remmbered as such. No amount of butt hurt whining can change that fact.
i think im gonna get addicted watching this
Whatever happens to Derpy, the show will still keep it's awesomeness.
dat intro
wha'ts this about a blow to the fandom?
...WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE? http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1330036229&sr=1-1
that one fan voice for derpy is still the best.
RAWRity: I believe so
as the old saying goes, the show must go on
even though I have VHS and the remastered I like watching it on your stream!
the iTunes ep came back...?
00,10what show is that Kencolt?
Peolple are overacting because RD no longer says "Derpy"
Tovler: you mean Balddumborat? yh, her fan voice sounds right
11,01No-one should go apeshit over the Derpy thing. It'll only shed a bad light on bronies in general.
*sigh*
parallellogic|dA: they modified the ep
That sucks
Parallel the itunes ep came back with a cesored derpy with a different voice and no derpy eyes
....ugh.
Why, Sailor Moon, of course. And yes, I am serious.
O_o
I'm strangely obsessed with vats of lube.
RAWRity: an elephant and ant couple
guys, can I ask a question? WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE? WHO? http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1330036229&sr=1-1
I say
lol'd thanks for the laugh there RAWRity
good thing I have the original
:[<3 youre going to LOVE THIS OPENING
Tovler: what, no jelly?
00,10ah yeah that ones rather large to archive.
Yeah, think I'll just retire from chat for a while.
RAWRity: whoa...thats a lot of lubricant.
yo afro
Did they edit the one on the Hub?
00,10enter best pet ever.
rawrity: probably for the travelling type
/me applauds Nittany_Discord until my her hands hurt
Sumica: indeed
When they go out of their way to kill our fandom, thats where the love and toleration needs to end.
00,10Hub version is unchanged
Is it just me, or does the redone Derpy scne Rainbow Dash sound a bit off?
and now here comes the ass kicking
D
good timing
XD
At least at the start.
<3 Hub always
8second lag, much better
^(OoO)^
I doubt its even the right person

Wait...the SHIP is named BeBop?
If nothing else, at least we can be fairly sure the DVD version aren't changed.
yep
Buytoast: eeyup
yes
I thought the guy's name was Cowboy Bebop.
Take your time, Sumica.
The guy's name is Spike
no, it's spike
Wow.
Buytoast: Cowboy is a term for a Bounty Hunter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sekr_DwbtuI&feature=related

and we still have the original in 1080p
I feel very stupid.
these lube reviews are awesome.
lol, that ad
Buytoast: the guys' name is Spike Spiegel
how does that shirt stay over her boobs?.......
No seriously. Why would you need 55 gallons of Lube? why would need that all at once?
?
rawrity: 1 word. orgy.
RAWRity: like i said, ant and elephant couple
I thought it was Buff Drinklots?
Colt_Magnum, that's one damn serious orgy.

Once I download both torrents of season 1 and 2, I'm moving them to my xbox FOR DOUBLE THE FUN!
RAWRity: LUBRICANT!!!
that was tara strong just trolling
you got to the point of going through the reviews?
Golakka: posted that already.
when an elephant loves a pig
daw
WTH MAN
weeeeeeeeeee
derpy was actually was gonna be a pony named Ditsy Doo
00,10and it was reported as fact.
that link..
why did they change her?
Tovler: that shirt's old hat. 55 Gallons of Lube is the new 3 wolf moon shirt.
PC nazis
Cause Trolling
they need to make up there mind!!!
butthi
RAWRity, did you go looking for the lube on purpose?
butthurt?
MAN. I got a science fair project due next week.
rofl.. omg the reviews
They felt it wasn't edgy enough. They wanted to show a pony intentionally destroy a building
And I am here!!11
Mythbusters, always makes science fun
AttackWithHugs: somebody I follow on twitter posted the link, saying "WHY? WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE?" and the rest was history.
it looked accidental in the previous episode
Dynamic_Brony just make something from this show lul
f*** THE LUBE
There's like 500 new pages of "new" Wolfshirt reviews. Old hat? I think not.
lol
Thats is wat I thought
10,02Why would they change the iTunes episode and nothing else though?
RAWRity: aaah. But still, that's a shit-ton of tube. I shouldn't chafe anymore then.
Tovler: but it's all the same thing "Oh, i'm fat and this shirt made me a sexy bitch"
00,10Apple covering there asses
gasp mythbusters is on here and i nearly missed it
TOO LOUDDD
SuperBrony64 because apple are covering thier asses
I suggested it LOL
Samari hat
http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Unicorn-Castle-Purple-T-shirt/dp/B0037TPED4/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t :( That's a nice shirt actually.
New TF2 Hat
10,02So this is just about Apple? They are going to keep the name and the voice on the show?
blank flank
DAT SHIRT
no
SuperBrony64 its still on the dvds as far as been reported
hello yay
SuperBrony64: i assume someone complained and then hasbro's pr department threw a hissy fit
baby buster
nope.ave Tovler
lol
and all other sources still keep derpy as is
00,10It's too soon to say SB.
including hub site
SuperBrony64: nobody really knows. This story just dropped a couple of hourse ago.
we wont know until it airs agani
WOW
Wow I've been asleep, I missed The Return of Harmony didn't i.
again'
I don't know SuperBrony64 but if I was you I would get a hold of the old episode
00,10but so far only Itunes version is changed.
September: missed a bit more than that
you can give that shirt to your anti-brony friends to they can troll you with it.
well i have to do an essay in my writing class and i can do it on anything so im going to do it on my little pony friendship is magic
Phase4 Like what?
propellor
I think it might be Apples Doing
00,10as of tight now Hubworld version is unchanged as is Indemand version.
September: derpy's voice was changed on the itunes copy
Im back and wat is this apple stuff?
bartsonic: Do it. hard.
rainbow's too
Phase4 Changed how?
of the last roundup
and that is another reason I dont like Apple very much
10,02I'm going to be sad if it's changed for good :(
Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer
September: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html
/me tricks iTunes into editting Rainbow's mane.
ive also worked on a power point for it hopes i can use it
Apple's rulers changed the episode on their own, that's why RD sounds weird
00,10but we already have the unchanged version SB.
Go! speed racer Go! speed racer GOOOO
00,10they cant change that.
SuperBrony64: well if it is, FUCK THEM. We've got the original, real Derpy, so they can suck it.
10,02But I mean in future episodes
I'm fine with the new voice. Derpy sounded a bit too derpy, imo. Getting rid of her name, though... that's just madness D:<
SuperBrony64 theres gonna be enough brony movement behind it where the original is basically better protected than any other episodes
10,02Are they going with that feminine voice and the lack of her name?
i dont like the new voice, its a bad va
SuperBrony64: we will hire Tabitha St. Germaine to redub the lines.
00,10Time will tell
No MGS mode
00,10But I saw last round up as a one time thing to begin with.
That can be the next project for Bronydubs.
The new voice is terrible.
Chaff Grenade
Illegal
:)
10,02Her voice was flawless the first time, the new VA doesn't make her sound clumbsy at all.
Palin vs Ponies
The new VOICE isn't bad, but it's clear that it was done very quickly, and likely not with a lot of direction, so the acting is shit.
Actually, I shouldn't say that. There might be lurking trolls here.
it will happen
i'm still offened that they did that thing with derpy. anyone else disabled and offened that they REMOVED the original scene?
oh god, I need to buy a car, put chaff and flare dispensers on it
00,10What Tovler? You want them to retcon dash in all eps to Darring do?
dat speed
Fox News did attack the Lorax afterall
My Little Daring Do
why has derpy been modified there was nothing wrong with her
bartsonic: bc people were offended by her
but then what would the reading rainbow episode be?
Sumica: at this point? The more petulant side of me wants to see how far we could push that kinda thing before hasbro completely loses their shit.
fox attacks anything new
-___- i dont want to live on this planet anymore
okay, rename applejacks
Tovler: Why'd they attack the Lorax? They attack EVERYTHING
I'm offended that people are offended
SilverStreak: they attacked the Muppets movie and The Lorax/ Arriety recently
dem stealth
also, something I saw the other day, THE LORAX is being used as a tie-in to sell SUVs.
the Lorax is hardly new though
Bye guyss
Oh man! Aircraft pornography on bronystate? we cannot do this :p
the Thneeds
my theroy is, if derp offends you.. then go on 4chan and memebase and take all derp related images off the internet.
can't be done.
00,10I like the show i dont want to see it get caned because pepole freaking out.
Goodnight
Dr. Suess' most environmentally minded book...is being used to sell cars that get 18 miles to the gallon.
well bye guys im off to go find a new planet to live on bye

@otakon why do such an evil thing? i love muppets. and i want to see the lorax and arriety
00,10Say hi to your peole bartsonic ^_^
prism
SilverStreak: bc Fox is insane and filled with idiots
10,02I'm sending a letter to Hasbro that I'm offended by their use of ponies in the show My Little Pony, it's offensive and the show needs to be redone with Pikachus.
btw, the EQD post is up to over 1000 comments already.
why not zoidberg
SuperBrony64: have fun man and hi!
lolSB64
/me hugs SuperBrony64
O.o
10,02Hai otakon :3
/me hugs otakon
hi otakon
If it gets over 9000 post then I will make a obvious joke
yay, but MLP along with the brony comminity would be an easier target than The Lorax or The Muppets
hiya Phase4
/me calls otakon on codec
i love the voice of the lorax. his voice is perfect
SB64, you lie, you could never say anything bad about ponies!
I don't think you could get away with that. Pikachu's already copyrighted.
10,02I know ;____;
SuperBrony64: I'moffended by them calling ponies "little". That's offensive to people and ponies who are short. Clearly the Dwarfism community is being ridiculed by their terminology.
10,02But I want Derpy back ;____;
Try platypi.
GRAY FOX!!!
I'm offended by their use of "My"
I'm sorry SuperBrony64. Derpy now partially belongs to haters now.
F117 car :p
It's "Our"
Look, MYTHBUSTERS :D
I saw them live a month earlier :D
As long as I still have the original. Deroy will live on
I just hope these dumbass kids don't blow this too out of purportion and end up getting the show canned..
SuperBrony64: we can only hope ;_;
Deroy
then who's to blame.
flywood
I'm offended by the grey pony destroying buildings. It looks like it was on purpose, and i must say TOO soon to apple.
Derpy
oh hello alarm, im already awake
DEROOOOYY JEEEENNKINNS

yawnface
Trying to watch Mythbusters, chat, and Minecraft at the same time isn't ending well for me. I'll be on Steam if anyone needs me :P
/me vanishes.
I'm offended that Pegasi are in MLP. Normal horses cannot fly, and this portrayal of ponies as being able to fly is hurtful to the pride and self-esteem of horses everywhere.
/me banishes Grim
Shut up.
I'm sad :(
Pegasi ponies are best ponies./
Wow, it's late. Well, going to bed. Bye everypony.
well im going to bed for real this time, instead of leaving sad because of the Derpy incident, so goodnight guys for real this time :)
/me wonders where Midnight_tempest went
I'm offended by the plainess of Earth Ponies
bye Darf14
I'm offended at Fancy Pants and the royal family. The bourgeois have no place in a harmonious society.
derpy was never ment to be offensive she's a pony not a human
I
I'
RAWRity, since when could Sarah Jessica Parker fly?
^
I'm offended at reality
Unicorns have magic, Pegasi have flying, Earth Ponies have nothing
oshi! Chaff cannon
SJP could fly in Hocus Pocus
they have cookies!!!
that's all that matters
and SJP flew to Dubai in Sex and the City 2.
Jesus likes ponies, so it's ok
i'm offended that this show have colors in it, it totally promotes imagination and free thinking in my time tv was black and white!
I'm an expert
I'm offended at reality! WHERES MY CHOCOLATE RAIN!?
I'm aslo offended by unicorns. The extinction of the unicorn race was a terrible event that occured a scant 3000 years ago. The fact that they would make jokes with unicorns so soon after the horrible destruction of their people is nothing short of disgusting. We should boycott hasbro!
ahh the pre- shockwatch sticker era
I'm scared by zombies, even if they take 3 days to respawn
i'm going to sleep, night everypony
o yeah. Unicorns are godless creatures that drowned in the flood.
I'm staying up till 3 in the morning to watch ponies.

i'm offened by the pegusi controlling the weather! only god can control the weather
how could they die in a floot
pegasi ponies control the weather
10,02Why are we linking lubricant in the chat?
But there is no god in Equestria.
i'ma leave this channel, later
...I'm offended by the word offended. Can we use a better word?
Also no flood.
F*** the lube
Severly displeased
thats the point
Derpy is Zeus

The pegasi could not hold all the clouds

00,10seem more like the bronys are buthurt then hasbro Tovler
i'm seriously disappointed, hasbro screwed up pretty badly
Can we stop talking about it!!!
What did Hasbro do now?
For the love of GOD
Poetic Justice!!!
Hasbro made more poniesa
Hasbro should have sent use preparation H before unleashing this.
*sigh*
00,10they did noting so far, it's only apple
"Eventually we discovered -purely by accident- that when combined with alcohol this became a delicious and soothing treat! We came up with a dozen different recipes involving everything from vodka to Goldschläger!"
Photon_Phoenix: just check EQD, its not good
Derp- chances are folks will be talking about it all day since more and more just hear the news
"Captain, we're approaching level 9 butt hurt from the Brony Scetor!"
for the love of Luna it isn't HASBRO!
it's apple doing it, not hasbro
only apple? unless you're saying apple was the one who modified the ep
"Shield on HIGH POWER"
BBPBPBbpppbpbpbpb
yep
its apple
apple did this? how? what proof do you have of that?
the itunes ep is the only modified version
DAMN APPLE
Okay, the Derpy problem: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8/
can we please talk about something else ? we are going to be hearing about this all week anyway
00,10Apple took down the ep, and refused to replace it.
Hub still has original
Thank you and enjoy the show
PLEASE
Talk ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
/me wonders if Screwball is responsible for this.
Why did they make Derpy look like a mental defective in the remake?
...I WANT A DISCO BALL
:c
that was longer than I expected. sorry.
It could be Apple you know, Rainbow Dash sounds a bit off when she talks to Background_Pony#4JF854F in the modified version.

RAWRity is having a little TOO much fun with the lube......

Where does the other ten minutes come from?

"A little over a decade ago, I bought my 55 gallon drum of lube. I never thought I'd use it all but a few days ago the pump finally ran dry. I've had a lot of good times with it. My wife, too. And not just what you'd think. One day I just hosed down our hardwood-floored hallway so I could use it as a slip-n-slide. You shouldn't think of this as a 'purchase.' It's an 'investment.' An investment sure to pay off in spades."

<@SuperBrony64> I have confirmed that BronyState streams don't work on the PS Vita :( <-- because they're flash based
10,02Cherry: Tell Lyra I said Hai as well :3
he did Midnight_Tempest
i'll buy one later on like a year or so
no all caps

The Vita is nothing but an oversized and overprised PSP
she told me to give this to you
10,02I got a PS Vita ;____;
i love Lyra
the ps vita is a scam
ill get once once they break the protection so i can put my own code on there
This would be a better ghost story with Nappa's ghost.
SuperBrony64: why didn't you wait man, it's too expensive atm
dat cat
bad kitty.
not too happy with the devkit they released
I am disappoint SuperBrony64... you could've bought something worthwhile with that much money...
Veewave: Ghost Nappa
00,10Cherry is lyra, but we are not supposed to notice that SB.
/me looks at his own cat sleeping near by
The PS Vita reminds me of the Game Gear...
F the cat
Cherry: ah, so thats your alias
from my point of view the 3DS is gimmicky.
Get out
It's all talk, hardly any action

Thick McRunFast
you got the 3G version of Vita?
10,02It's not for everypony sure, but I liked it enough to warrant a purchase
SuperBrony64: super expensive low capacity memory cards, no UMD support, have to PAY to redownload UMD games you already own, NO 1st party support and a HORRIBLE release line up. SuperBrony64 I know you like it but it was a bad idea to buy it right off the bat is all I'm saying

10,02First, I got an 8 GB Memory card for free with my system, UMD games were meant for a PSP, not the Vita, but if you downloaded PSP games, they work on the system already, there are a ton of great 1st party games that warrant a purchase.
oh Momoko, this chick is CRAZZEE
I like where this is going

warning: wall of text about the final fight in TTGL
Theoretically if the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 10 million light years across, it would mean that its eventual battle with the equally large Granzeboma would last several billion years, considering that nothing can exceed the speed of light. This would mean that swinging an arm alone might be a feat that would traverse several million light years, which will require the same number of years in real time, to execute. However, sin
lolz
AND THATS HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE
SCIENCE
and this is how EQUESTRIA was made...

Wait....I knew that already........:'(
Hi everypony.
think Hasbro anticipated the whole Derpy fiasco, and now make us suffer for it?
well, it still is kinda their fault in a way.. unless it was just Apple that screwed with it.
we're good.
I knew Hasbro would do something about Derpy as soon as I heard her in the show
but if it was hasbro, they know we'd be upset with atleast telling us.
Or anyone in general
Well, it's just been a few hours since this went down.
give it time to shed light on the situation
aka shitstorm incoming
Shitstorm already came.
00,10best bet it to take a wait and see.
But theres only 9 minutes until the stream starts D:

timers off honestly.

Lolwut
notice how RD doesn't say "Derpy" as well
I'm ripping both seasons on torrent as we speak.
I aint even mad.
...
Wow.
Fuck

Derpy's voice is good from a non Derpy standpoint
CupcakeWarrior: :<

Are you shitting me?
it doesnt fit the video, acting is bad
00,10why is that compleatly normal gray pony wrekcing town hall intentonaly?
^
Sumica: because derp is bad
No :[
It's a good voice, but it doesn't fit derpys character. :P
Also MY EARS!!!
NO :[
acording to abotu 3 people by my guess

Remember kids: being different is bad.

yay
Yay
00,10it's only the Itunes version so far dari.
I think hasbro broke him....
time for Peckish
nvm
Is this a parody of something?
It's probably pressure from Apple, about it being offensive or something.

meh: Is your mum a brony?
i blame the chinese
Hasbro didn't ruin Derpy. They did the fans a service, and many fans were not amused. if you want to blame someone, blame the fans and the people who disliked the portayed Derpy. That is all
Do you guys think I should tell my mom I am a brony?
Woof
no shes not unfortunatley but shes cool with me liking them
FULL MOON?
LUNA IS COMMING :O
yay
YES
i only got a chance to show her feeling pinkie keen
CupcakeWarrior: Go for it. Parents should always be accepting of their children, no matter what.
hell with this im gonna listen to MLP music :)
Well, not literally.
But you get the idea.
The moral of this episode is to not trust bald guys.
I feel a huunger coming on.....
i told everyone in my family except my father im a brony lol
meh: What a shame.
stream some sort of mlp pleaseee
Weed
BALD GUY + HITMAN

Hitman
HITMANS EVERYWHERE
Reaper: Agent 47
yea agent 47
whatever ;3
CupcakeWarrior: She could say "Nice cover" though.
my mum heard me listening to pony music
My mum would be like: YOU WHAT?
she was confused...
I still don't get how a bald guy with a barcode and an European accent can fit in EVERYWHERE.
My family is fine with it.
OMG: http://youtu.be/m480ZuwkkYU this video made me laugh
I showed my mom my Brony shirt the other day... she facepalmed :D
I became a brony after i moved away from home, noone knows i do. :cool:
Have some banter with my dad about it though. :P
No video links during stream
Just saying
My parents tease me from time to other about it, but it's all cool.
i actually told her when we were going through channel menus one time and shes like oh you wanna watch mlp and i was like hell yeah man that shows great she was like lolwut
We all know it's for fun.
My panerts says i am baby... :D
your parents suck
And they are silent :3
she likes taunting me with things like that but the shoe was on the other foot this time
I still need to get my girlfriend to watch MLP

Have fun, MASF123.
That was a cool one. :D
bb
Also, You have exactly 20 seconds to sate your false arguments as to why rarity isnt best pony
Go
To this day, noone has found the remains of the fourth wall
she whines
I'm just too busy sorry guys, I only came to say hello :(
because pinkie pie is best pony
I should probably also leave, but not before in an hour and 15 minutes.
She's whining, uptight and snobby.
Pinkie=Best pony
^
DAMN
Everypony is best pony!
Golakka: Because Twilight is best pony.
owned
Rainbow Dash is best pony
HE GOT TAKEN OUT
Silencer shots XD
Of the Mane 6, anyway.
but seriously
fluttershy
Pinkie Pie is best pony though, She always makes me smile.
pinkie pie
Rarity is best pony, All other ponies are a very close second :P
rainbow dash
applejack
Dash is best pony
twilight
is the episode today at 10?
spike is best pony - end of arguing!
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY CHOSE BEST PONY :[
No one likes Applejack
Aww, brutal kick
There's no ep today
someon tell me so I can decide how much longer to sleep
there's no episode today, TyeDyeBrony
I think Derpy actually got 65% votes out of most of the fanbase 6_9
D:
Fluttershy is adorable and all, but of the Mane 6, Twilight is obviously superior.
Spike is best Rainbow Dash
i cant see anypony but pinkie pie as best pony
yay sleep
If fluttershy is crying, i want to kill the one responsible.
rarity = worst pony
soz
Pew pew pew.
Rarity is third best pony
Nope. No actual wolf.
It's a werewolf.
my dice decided i should pick flutteshy
theyre all great ponies but pinkie will always be there to help them smile :)
its an alien
Nah, it's just a hungry pony howling
Werewolf is best wolf.
shes not bad just the worst out of them
no
IT"S A FLUTTERSHY BECAUSE IT:S HER SHED
a vigorous job, Your Majesty. What say you?
lol
jog*
Well...

Hello and goodbye KwakLad
Honorable soldier
Oh good bye MASF123
Hello KwakLad
ded
:)
hiya Kwak
OMFG..
Werewolf < Knife. Royal guard
what is this anyway?
Hey Scavender how you doing?
Any man who is not willing to die for a cause, is not worth being called a man
that man is dead very very dead
Yea, doing fine, thanks for asking.
Golakka: How many roads must a man walk down?
i meant the movie
be vewy vewy quiet
When is Pinkie gonna break out of the fourth wall?
42!
Kammerjunk: 42
ROOF!
KwakLad: Oh ho ho, you magnificent bastard.
/me is back
Also you, Jake. But you didn't ping me, so I didn't notice.
isn't it a thousand miles?
AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MILES
AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MORE!
AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MORE
Kammerjunk: i had an argument with my physics teacher last week about what 42 meant, she thought it was the meaning of life
i'm not so good with irc
JUST TO BE THE MAN TO WALK A THOUSAND MILES TO FALL DOWN AT YOUR DOOR!
oh dear
NNAAA NA NA OH!
KwakLad: But it's the answer, not the meaning!
DU DOO DOO
42 is the amount of letters in that sentence, if you didn't know.
NAAA NA NA HO
/me sings in bad Scottish accent
42 is the answer, what is the questio?
DO DA DA RUM RUM DA RUM DA RUM
Lycanthropy.
Kammerjunk: i had to explain that it was just an arbitrary number to a nonsensicle question and that Deep Thought explaind they didnt give a proper question and so he designed the earth to make the true questioin
it was a shouting match in physics
but it failed becaus it was destroyed
KwakLad: Douglas Adams even said himself that it was a load of horseapples.
Throw the books at 'em
because knowledge is power
Woooo
Kwaklad, deepthought picked 42 from the amount of letters in the "answer" though, if i remember right? :P
wb
Pinkie pies message of the week ;3
And because knowing is half the battle
!
Meteoric Iron?
dat comic
Just have one thing to say
if the pen is mightier than the sword why are actions stronger than words
sorry if the pen is mightier than the sword, why are actions stronger than words
Snuffsis: So now we just have to find EVER POSSIBLE COMBINATION.
Because human society is still very primitive. :P
makes it readable :P
silly Dash, dont you know paint is bad for your body?
Steampunk.
What are we wacthing?
Kammerjunk: haha, definitely, but probably the one from the book is the right one? :P
Crown Diamond.
<____<
CRAFT ALL THE SHOVELS
Snuffsis: The answer was never found.
Earth was supposed to figure it out.
Rarety is now jealous
big hunk of DIAMOND!
little Tom
;) MINE ;)
OMG Thank you :D
:S
Prince Albert in a Can.
Oh this episode :3
And now the Doctor went oatmeal.
wonder why they delayed the episode >_>
Kammerjunk: I know, but that she picked 42 as the "answer" was because that was the amount of letters in the question. or so i heard. :P
Trapception.
THE TRAP HAS BEEN DOUBLED
O_O
i LOVE the way david tennant plays it when EVERYTHING comes together in the doctors head
its brilliant
Dum dum duuuuuuuuuuuum
Golakka: It is brilliant.
Yes, jump down into a room made of walls you're allergic to.
Good diea.
Kammerjunk: That is just what i said! :P
I am pleased
Golakka: And I agreed with you D:
I finally managed to embark in an area in Dorf Fort that has Fluxstone
So who's streaming :3

Read this guys
yes
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Ik_WOzqnA&feature=player_detailpage DISCORD YOUVE CROSSED DA LINE
it is actually looking like it is more of an action of Apple, rather than Hasbro, that edited the Itunes episode.
Ugh.
I dont take any offence though and im almost blind in my right eye
=/
That's it. I thought Ponies restored my faith in humanity. Now I JUST LOST IT AGAIN!
hasbro's actions up to this point seemed to indicate that they were fine with leaving Derpy as-is. but it seems that Apple exec worried about the controversy and had the Itunes installment edited.
Nevertheless it is still unsure whether the dvd will contain the original or the edited
Its original i think i read somewhere
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umab4jYKrOk&feature=player_detailpage BRING BACK THE WEEPING MEMORIES
Wrek, can you put up the edited derpy scene?
We need top wait for official statements from both companies, but it's seeming much more like the fault of Apple than Hasbro art this point.

yeah, it's been stricken from the ep
but...the eyes? The voice?
03o.o
or at least on itunes
Blame Apple/iTunes. They were responsible for the edit.
oh ok
Ashleigh's voice sounds diff. too.
Oh thank Inari.
not sure about the dvd
:/
New Derpy voice is Tabitha St Germain
i still thinkt here was absolutely no need to cut the name but eh... happened
/me gives Link02 a brohoof
I was about to lose faith in Faust and the team.

The original voice actor didn't know Derpy was a girl when she played it..
sai tool eh? not bad choice of software
*^*
Right.
you could sign this, might make you feel better http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-do-not-change-derpys-name
Hi!
i already like that gaze
Big adventures tones of fun a beautiful heart faithful and strong <3
but will likely accomplish nothing
If Hasbro caved in, they could've lost their deal with Apple/iTunes. Doesn't how small it may seem.
...
hey guys
/me scratches her puggle's tummy.
Faust is now only the Consulting exec
I mean 'If Hasbro didn't* cave in'
im bored
can i get a question i have been asking for 2 days answered please?
the title of that petition is extremely flawed
I like this song.
Why the hell would I sign it and give away where I live?
XD
I'm reading a lot of rumors here.
OMG THIS SONG
invent a place
"do not change derpy" would be more accurate, actually
Squee

Hasbro needs to find an alternative to iTunes.

What brush set does he use?
it's just not the same without her old voice!
Doomsdaylee: It does not! Only because of the Deadmau5.
5$ says he just caught a ton of crap by linking that stream...
i hope they'll air the ep soon on the hub again. i'm burning to see if that'll be the changed or the original version. since the hub is kinda the canon
Awwww I just read that puggles and beagles both suffer from epilepsy, my little puggle could get epilepsy, yes he could, he could get pugglepsy.
he just uses crayons and draws on the monitor

matrix pony
NOT TOUCHING SAM
I've read cupcakes, Rainbow factory, but I'm not going NEAR sweet apple massacre
i dont even think i read the good one, i think i read a remake of SAM
sweet apple massacre made me laugh... but i have a twisted scense of humor
I've only read Cupcakes; I don't feel like reading those other two.
^
Is that chell pony?
I'll always recommend the Discorded/Reharmonized series.
SAM really did nothing to me, cuz ik that Mac would not do that stuff that he did in that fanfic
OK I'm back.
/me hopes Cupcakes' author is so haunted by what he wrote he never writes again
Nor would Dashie in Rainbow factory, but it still struck a blow.
Would Pinkie?
Does anyone yet know what brushes he's using?
And I'm about to read Sweet apple massacre

I wouldn't wish that on most people ><

Steam. Hmmm. Gotta gets me some of that.
I wish I knew how to go into private chat >.<
We must conquer this world in the name of friendshp before we move to the next.
Yeah... most of those teens are failing to relaize it's a good show
yeah lol
Who here has ever heard of Oddworld?
Because they showed the intro
There is only one
Chrome, Bronies react to kids eact to my little pony.
And an unfunny image macro.
11,01They should have shown the teens Lesson Zero and not tell them it was MLP.
Hoofsies
xD
ikr
it's a sad day today, but hello anyway
Lesson Zero made me a brony
11,01Show the episode but cut out the intro.
LOL.
What I love about the Teens react to: Was that if you watched their faces, they all had shifty eyes XD
YTPMV'S made me a brony
:)
%Nittany_Discord: Which is what I do all the time XD
11,01Then leave in the credits so they go "That was My Little Pony?!"
:D
Watching Fluttershy kick a bear's ass makes me so happy
I kew it! Chell Pony!
Epic Pie Time was too awesome for me.
S1E1 made me a brony
Party of One was one the best things I have ever seen ever.
Epic cupcake time
Friendship is Magic Bitch was what started me XD
Who wants to hear Gotta Glitch after this?
Party of one scared me but made me jhappy
Nittany_Discord: I think they wanted that "Ewww" reaction from the teens
happy*
The very first time i saw MLP, I watched from start to finish, every episode in 2 days
That and seeing Midna turn Pony when I was in love with her XD
did that too
My life felt complete
Lesson Zero, Luna Eclipsed, Party of One. Tough choice
11,01I used to skip the intro when I watched MLP TBO.
watched the whole of season 1 in 3 days
11,01*TBH
Same i skip the intro of most tv shows
I watched season 1 in livestreams.
whats this, dubstep winter wrap up or something?
Before Bronystate.
11,01I skip the intro of most anime's I've watched.
Before i go to bed every night, I watch an episode or two so i am thinking of ponies when i sleep
think i started 5 or so episodes late into the show, watched all in one succession, hooked
and wtf are you drawing
Chell Pony, t looks like.
But hard to tell
Pinkamena dianne pie :D?
Or fluttershy?
Pinkie Pyro!
Buck yeah
o i love pinkamena
ha! it IS propane!
Pinkamena Chell?
t
needs moar blood
with accesories, even
Allo everypony.
It's fluttershy Samus
Pinkamena slaughtershy and twilight psycho are best ponies
That man was a hero for the day.
Hey Mean
SayWhat: seems logical
Seems legit.
Everything is logical
I only had to watch 14 episodes in to catch up to all the ponies.
i has to watch the hole of season 1
11,01Multi-dimesional pony characters are great.
Meanwhile, Meanwhile enters
I came in mid-way through season 2
I'm ashamed to say I'm a relative latecomer.
No worries Sonic
^
I was around 6 episodes in before i realised Rarity was a main character :P
I came in right before the Last -Round-up aired.
xD lmao
I converted my wife to XD
it is never too late to follow the path of the pony
that does NOT sound like twilight (song)
I came midway through Season 1, just after the huge January break.
More...what is it, Syndicate? Drawings. Awesome.
Just had to show her Disqord.
CRAP
DAMN USAS 12
05no this isnt chell
11,01I came in around June. Watched the episodes on YT.
05whoever that is
11,01Not in one day.
It is Fluttershy Samus
11,01Chell is the protagonist from Portal.
Ok, ANYONE got EQ suggestions for win7?
Wrek: Chell is the Portal protagonist.
spring is heeeeeeeereeeeeee
I'm still calling Pyro Pinkie
05does she have a fmalethrower?
05then how could you even consider it from the begining
no
Is the pony countdown on this page legit?
oh
im calling pinkamena dianne pie
Female thrower? What?
Pinkie Pyro?
Ponies with flamethrowers.
11,01It's a Syndicate thing.
Portal Gun which is what the flamethrower looked like in it's early stages.
yes
No, but I can sorta see the similarity to the portal gun.
11,01Crossover.
Dat music
fuel tank on back
Was anyone else totally weirded out by Pinkie in the last episode?
No?
11,01Wrek's been looking forward to that game.
No
/me doesn't know what the picture is about
Yeah..like, more-so than usual?
That's just her
No O_o
Pinkie helping Pinkie up onto a hill, and like, octoPinkie.

WOW
PON-3: no
syndicate
I wish i could draw like that :(
Pinkie is best pony.
Not that...but
4th wall breaking is pinkies style
Pinkie is bizarre.
Au contraire, I loved it
Mmmm, medieval dubstep
Her just compleate disregard for laws and ponies.
Wub it
/me was VERY BORKED
11,01Makes me want to play Deus Ex: HR.
I just need to get past the stick figure :D
That's what freaked me.

I wanna play :D
A minor one
11,01Sure did.
When one of my tracks was ending at a show and it was beatmatching into a new track, I heard a pony say "It sounds like robots f*cking!" :P

11,01BF2142 was nice.

We have cake and friendship, that's how we roll.

SuperBrony64: YOu are a mod not just a visitor of this place, i am not surprised you are tired :p
applejack096: well okay, that's understandable bu you don't HAVE to join the chat you know to watch the stream right?

Meanwhile Oh yes, how could I forget? What with our breaking into ponies houses and kidnapping little ones and brainwashing them with love and friendship.

I don't like cake... but only because I don't eat very much, so I never eat as much of it as I want to.

Meanwhile: oh, you mean SPIKE GET DOWN?

08,01hurts like hell
Caterpillar conjunction.. waht?
otakon u kno im a girl who likes gaming right?
The_4th_Wall But what about Twilight Psycho? What with her creating discord with the Want it Need it spell.
08,01otakon: my eyes are falling out
applejack096: well good on ya
Oh snap. That does sound bad.
/me glomps applejack096
Oh damn
10,02i liek gaming too :3
08,01KwakLad: no, but it's indirectly related
gaming is cool
10,02^
whats glomps suoerbrony64??
i have no idea what that thing is you have
Chrome: she snapped because OCD rules and governs her life
It eats up free time and doesn't afraid of anything.
what's it do?
08,01what happened was, i stopped wearing the glasses because they were hurting my nose and causing a rash
Otakon So is my wife XD And she's a Brony
/me says what
10,02Glomps = Tackle hug
08,01so i wore contact lenses
08,01for 2 days only
Ohh
It's still more that 1 week until new ponies?
i can see where this is going :p
08,01and in that time, the conctact lenses caused a hyper-immune response on my right eyelid
Tovler: Technically it's 1 week.
The_4th_Wall: True, but it caused tons of Discord...and after his little "interest" in her...whos to say she couldn't be a back up? XD Pinks does have the power, but XD
how did that fuck up your eyes?
Chrome: Pinkie spreads chaos all the time, and of her own volition
....
oh
that DOES sound painfull
The_4th_Wall True enough. I concede your point.
Whut did i miss?
08,01so you know how if you're allergic to a dog and one licks your arm, it will bubble up and go red?
(ugh, that damn hamburger pizza… I have to have it)
08,01that's basically what i've got on the inside of my eyelid
Oh sheeit
ouch
fucking ouch
Pinkie is best pony. MY LOGIC IS UNDENIABLE.
When you blinked with the contact lens...
wat did i miss?
05dat exåression
huh, actually, I didn't know that about the dog.
applejack096: not much
05sxpression
It scratched up your eyelid
05i think i nailed it
damn you lag STOP IT!
:|
I think so to Wrek.
08,01so i'm currently ocularly useless, because i can wear neither glasses nor contact lenses
4th wall, I deny your logic.
kk otakon wat song is this?
Dat Moostasche
no idea applejack096 ask Wrek
Use monocles on both eyes
08,01SayWhat: now that... that is an amazing idea
Wrek wots this song?
For we are talking about the magical land of ponies, also knoiwn as Equestria. Tell me how logic applies here.
08,01Tovler: i guess i am, yes
Sonic, I reject your denial and throw a party
but where does one get monocles?
08,01but it's only for a few days until my eye and nose heal
is Wrek drawing?
CCCP Yep
si
Yes. Yes he is.
SayWhat See what? XD
08,01otakon: they're causing a rash on my nose
/me 08,01is allergic to eyesight
Chrome: Who?
Chrome: Where?
Wreck dude ur gooood!
SayWhat I was joking "Si? See What?"
BUZZ LOOK A PONY!
Chrome: I know :P
But I'm a Rainboom. I crash your party by blowing up the whole building your in.
08,01that's £17 for contact lenses down the drain, tough...
IT'S PYRO PINKIE
Taste the rainbow.
08,01*tough
08,01*though
/me dives for cover.
08,01literally; i had to flush the lenses this morning
08,01w/in 30

USE GUMMI FOR A SHEILD, SHE WON'T BURNINANTE HIM

Punch that...oh wait you're 12. I can't say that.
Very loOOOOUUUUUUUDD!!!!!!!
Kill your mother in the name of friendship.
Hold on Ponies.
SayWhat: that is some really awful advice.
Too late
tell her that watching a show you like is your choice, and she has no word in that
applejack096 Why is it she wants you to stay way from ponies?
LOL GUYS!!!!
She had a heart attack last year
Meanwhile: 'Tis the best :o
Seriously, applejack096 is like, 12.
Only watching more ponies can stop you from being a pegasister. that makes sense, right?
Cause im 12 she feels im too old!
Pinkmena?
I'm 19.
Nopony's too old!
applejack096 21, and as an added bonus, in the Air Force XD
make ur mom watch ponies
Dat Journey

Tell your mom to watch it
I agree with CCCP...
05dat added bonus

I said there r people older than me who like it she wont listen!
I'm 11
PROBLEM OFFICER

stare at here while she sleeps. when she notices, tell her the ponies are silent. you don't know who is bad if they are silent
26. I was in highschool when you were born?
Show her the show..maybe Lesson Zero or one of the mature themed ones
What seems to be the officer problem?
There should probably some red damage number somewhere to the left of the image :L
drive your point home via fiddling with a sharp object
I think the youngest we ever had is 10 if im not mistaken
Yeah.
@Wrex I work on bombs, do school, make games, and watch ponies XD
