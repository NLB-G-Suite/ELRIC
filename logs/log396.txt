09,01no but seriously the culture over here is different

09,01kids don't move out when they go to college, at least not usually
09,0120
HAI GURLZ
09,01but yeah, over here
09,01the "dorm system" doesn't exist
09,01the universities/colleges are just institutions you visit, kind of like high school, and have no housing installations
Same ~
Its ok. The dorm system is odd here sometimes too. I know colleges that require you to live in the dorm
09,01Panama
I liked living in the dorms
Me too.
09,01so yeah, over here, you don't move out till muuuuuch later
:$
09,01or well
Depends
09,01that's how it works with most other faculties
09,01but in my med school, it's kind of like
hello
you people scare me
you know i'm not the little boy that i used to be i'm all grown up and baby can't you see~
┻━┻ ︵╰(°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

09,01most other careers are like "you work? Yeah okay cool. We have night shifts too"
That was two years ago. It was my fault, trust me.
09,01to put it simply: Med School is a full-time job for them
HNNNG
NO YOU DON'T
Sorry. That's way too personal, I'll be random.
Is the college there more like an extended schooling system, where everyone just automatically goes after high school?
I'LL BE RANDOM NOW

/me eats pasta with a dagger
But I do like "Gosick".
/me eliminates Eulshy's dagger
I want to go to a con someday
/me eats with a sword, quite awkwardly
never made it a comic con, Mainly one that are held in Texas.
/me eliminates Eulshy's sword
Puhhhh, you are eating with a sword?
I'm planning on three conventions this year.
You people are weird.
/me uses another sword
/me snatches Eulshy's other sword.
/me uses hand axe
i have a lot of these things
i think i'm going to tf2 ~
that should be the site's slogan

she looks good
/me uses hoofs
/me uses wings
mmmm blood sauce
/me chops off Eulshy's wings
Besides that, she looks awesome.
/me uses back hoofs
This fandom...
/me uses face
Did do a good job on: http://jadenkaiba.deviantart.com/art/Commission-MLP-Gala-Dresses-Human-Versions-282852480
It's super-effective!
wrong choice
/me licks tape till un adhesive
/me pushes off with tounge
Rikki?
/me cuts out Eulshy's tongue then re-duct tapes mouth

/me chews it off
/me dislikes Vic Minogna. And his crazy fanbase
/me continues to eat
I'm more of a Yuri Lowenthal girl.
/me pulls out Eulshy's teeth then re-duct tapes mouth
I havent seen Vin Minogna in a couple years now actually
Exactly
Minogna was Yu-Gi-Oh, right?
/me wonders why people are letting him be brutally disfigured while trying to eat pasta
Yes
Well, humans OR ponies. http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/202/d/4/friendship_is_magic_by_extvia-d416u0m.jpg cross-work can be odd-looking
Oh, and Ed! I know FMA well enough :)
I like it
/me leaves
:(
/me pushes tape in mouth on the bowl, eats tape, continues to eat
Yeah. I loved their outfits, but its a little awkward on the faces
I like Rarity's
/me has endless pasta, uses magic to heal self, swims out continues to eat
The dresses were very well adapted
I'd like to see Paranoi Agent again. Ever since Geneon went bankrupt, that series has disapeared
/me the pasta is still eliminated and out of Eulshy's reach though

You do guys know there is a continuous livestream that shows Toonami shows called: Toonami Aftermath, right?
Toonami still airs?

http://www.toonamiaftermath.com/
I thought that disapeard like 10 years ago when CN was starting to go downhill
In fact, Sailor Moon is coming on in an hour on that stream
/me bursts into flames
They have had a ton of weird airings mixed in
awwww
And yes, that is where I've seen The Room Riffed.

Okay, i'll PM you then. :P
I have a book you all should pick up: http://www.amazon.com/This-Book-Full-Spiders-Seriously/dp/0312546343

it's a sequel to "John Dies At The End"
I'm studying at university. :P
went to even
Fear me i

"John Dies At The End" followed by "This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It"

I'm not actually asking for the length of the hypotenuse
OH XD
hold on one sec

I got it as 5^2x+5^-2x but answer sheet says it's 5^2x + 2 + 5^-2x
wouldn't that be 0^2?
sorry, I'm dumb, that's not right, urgh. Hang on, lemme get some paper.
Math?
6_9
???
um....
(5^x + 5^-x)^2 = (5^x + 5^-x) * (5^x + 5^-x)

Yea, did that. But i didn't get 5^2x+2+5^-2x. the +2 they say it is, became a +10 for me... :P
oh wait it's in my pocket
Dun dun dun.
Then you add the together, like this: (5^x*5^x)+(5^x*5^-x)+(5^-x*5^x)+(5^-x+5^-x)

yeah you got it :3
lol ping myself
nonononono
is fun
Whis is 5^2x+1+1+5^-2x
5^x * 5^-x = 1
Yea, i didn't do 5^0, i just removed the exponent completely making it 5+5 instead of 5^0+5^0 :P
1 * 2
=2
which is 5^2x+2+5^-2x
yep :3
No prob ^_^
no problem. I had that shit drilled into my head when I was learning Algebra in high school.
but seriously though,you MUST FOIL it right
Games = Physics = Much matho
And math as well.
Math is helpful for that...
Yea, i'm going to (if plands hold out) study at the same university as the guys behind Magicka
but Learning to program is 90 percent of it
I got it easier to wrap my head around physics than complex mathematics
Physics isn't necessarily simpler, but much more practical.
Physics :3333
Dat vector math
Yea
It's not THAT many calculations to do either
at least in a vacuum XD
(not really, but the point remains hte same:P)
As long as you ignore air resistance and friction physics is easy.
Now PARTICLE PHYSICS
thats hard
Yea, i'm not going into particle physics field
Well don't use particle emitters then.
Otherwise it's all linear algebra
Physics engines, lighting engines, etc.
i only passed algebre skill II
id there anything to whatch tonight?
It's the same university where the Magicka team graduated from.
Wow, didn't know about Magicka? xd
Well, if you want to check the work being done at my uni check this site

Oh, heating pad. How glorious thou feel.
/me the characterization of the Teen Titans in the animated show never really matched up with their comic counter parts, since the animated series were actually Teens not Young Adults
Oliver Queen.
I hope to find an Oliver Queen of my own someday ^_^
But Teen Titans was a good show on its own. It may not have held the comic-style but it definitely was good story telling
Hey yall

imagine how much work this for this to be done properly
I still haven't watched Clannad.

He's gone
/me is too slow
One Piece is just bullshit....i am sry One Piece fans but i tried to watch it...watched 50 episodes of it and still can't like it...
maybe cause of the way it is drawn
its all opinion
or i hate the characters...
I'm not into One Piece, either.
but something with One Piece i just don't understand
00,10it has way too much padding for my likeing.
00,10mind you I wont play the whole thing but it's still epic.
hmm how about elfen lied anyone?
Didnt like that one. Too blunt
the only thing i liked about one piece is the marine war
I never saw that, is it good? I heard alot of things :D
Is it Monster? I loved that show
hmm it was interesting if you could handle the first 10 minutes of the first episode
