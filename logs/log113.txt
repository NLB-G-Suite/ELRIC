and insightful
eeyup
I'll be going now, have fun speculating. Let me know what your research brought up.
thought excercises
Well, for one we've been spending a lot on laptops so I didn't want to add another one to the list of expenses
Seeya later alligator
bye
cya
Laters Rainboom
Bonk.
Welp, that was interesting day at uni
Second, everything goes through approval, so I'd have to make a good point on why he needs a new laptop, probably better than just "Oh yeah, it gets pretty damn hot"
8AM till 8:30PM
deaaad islaaaaand
btw any Always Sunny fans? I posted this on reddit and wanted to share this with the brony community
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9k0Ss7EWA
check it out if you want
sounds awful.
warning a bit of strong language
Has he had much trouble with it other than overheating?
Hai dere
LvS, you mean my day or something?
Okay ladies, time for a nap
yes
Well, it wasn't too bad actually
Nope. His battery did bite the dust and I gave him an old one from another lappy that's already retired

Twilight told me this video is about Rainbow Got Molested
Not that much studying or so today, but there were some other things to attend to that took so much time
And that's dying too
>PK
Mother? XD
But other than those, nope
No.
Short for PsychicKid
Ah, well if that's the only problem that does make it a little harder to justify.
ok then

What's the countdown again @—@
But Mother is one of my favorite series
lol
Twilight told me this picture is about forms Nightmare_Moon luna celestia
!s2
^ was relevant a few minutes ago
Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:24m:34s
Yup :(
alsooooo something else. will find.
/me nap
So I've ten days to finish mah ponymation
It's 4 years old, but it is a 17" so it's probably got some pretty beefy hardware in there still so I'm betting performance issues haven't cropped up yet for him.
I need moar ponies
Since I'm havin' that as deadline for whatever reason
Cmon Do It For A-MARE-ICA
Hasbro y u take down videos from youtube QQ
Yup! It was a top-end machine so to do what he needs it's been great so far
because though they simply had to fudge it, they have to stay within a budget.
Is it really hasbro that's taking them down?
Sadly 17" is a requirement for him, but the only Dell machines that are 17" are either lacking the security we need or >$2000
It is
Apperantely
Or, habsro
habsro indeed
yea the typo in the name make it a bit fishy
ouch
Just 10 more days...
my computer is 7 years old trololololol
And Hasbro has been takin' down 1080p episode uploads anyway
Celestia help me
actually, i saw some that said Hasbro
Do you have a contract with Dell for sole supplier?
From what I understood
it's not hasbro. it also didn't happen the first time
Hasbro wants them up
07SUDDENLY!
Trolls learnt to spell
720p uploads are back up again anyway
^
Suddenly chat springs back to life!
LUNA OUTTA FUKKEN NOWHERE!
there's a couple of channels with HD FiM episodes
07EXACTLY!
The links on the front page of EQD work fine, they're 1080
720P is fine by me lol
07Lurkmode offline
Nope, Dashite, but we try to keep all of the same manufacturer since the more we buy from them the better the possible discounts we get yearly
It's just that YouTube's flagging system is easily exploitable
So many Hasbro animators, etc visit this site and they haven't taken those down
8 bit is perfect so long as it's ponies!
I need to watch Winter Wrap Up nao
So it's possible to go elsewhere, just discouragee. Got it.
They want them up to hook new bronies
Oh look it's a luna
ohay Luna!
fine by me, btw
well, the animators don't have anything to do with taking down stuff
07ohai
/me meows at Luna
/me meows back softly
/me hhnnnnghs

If you traced my systems part history it's a 386, even though there are no parts left from it.
Still up
Hey, it's FlutterWatts.
Hah!
Nice job!
Reggie Flutterwatts?
omaigawd thank you Cesco
Dude! That uploader made my favorite joke about spring!
We having again a stream tonight?
My current computer is about the same as when I bought it 3 years ago now.
07Maybeeee
Wasn't the P4 a direct descendant of the 386 anyway too?
Damn what's all of this CC Y stuff @—@
benjamin?
That's a horrible name dude
CC = Closed Captions available, Y = Youth (TV-rating)
best name ever
That looks nice
FckShtStack: eeyup.
And you can't remove those things off the video, can you?
not pink enough, but i like it!
DeMagickxz - all the episodes are listed in a scroll bar to the right under "youtube streams"
Ah yes that artest, I think that's his first pony work too.
nice and convenient
Hmm
Mkay
My 720p videos don't have those...
le gasp
itunes vids
07Have some crazy me
link to channel plz?
07http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr0nv6hQ1D1qbe7gjo1_500.png
FckShtStack: who's Benjamin? Besides my RL name?
They are on my computer D_D
Benjamin is a character in mah game
I'm curious
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTPqjKk_xCo&feature=channel_video_title the hell
do YouTube videos have 6-channel audio encoding?
Or do they downmix to stereo?
when is the stream starting again?
nah, just stereo afaik
i dont think so
i like that pic
480p + Stereo
Pony downloads, was updated regularly durring season 1 -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vEUmE4WgUjXhXT8elNTkvt6JpHUTm4-bFXvmhPoQNI/edit?hl=en&authkey=CKuAhdcF
Me too
360p - Mono
but they use aac encoding
at least for the 480 and up
I've seen a 1440p video on there before
It was awesome.
071:15 hr
And took ages to buffer. T_T
See, I always wondered about the audio encoding
that would be a 1440x900 res video xD
No
Fluttershy is best poni
are there any sneak peaks of season 2?
Not 1440x900
I think I can watch more house today, I'll leave early!
About 2460x1440
That'd be 2460x1440
Yeah
DEMAGICKSXZ
oh cool
I LOVE YOU
Hope I can home in time for house
That was just an estimate
I don't think so Ponies other than the grayRBD
Err
I can't believe I got it right
xDD
Thanks
so... time for 3 more poni eps
ok
Is linking to torrent sites allowed?
Umm.,,
Should be
I can't pick a favorite pony it's too hard
yeah
but I'm leaning currently towards Rainbow Dash
lol fluttershy is obviously the best
Lol
Fluttershy is best poni D:<
and number 2 is luna xD
Fluttershy is awesomely cute
linking to pirated material? we're becoming a normal IRC channel
i would never like to pick
its to tough
Gah
I like Applejack too
Agreed.
they're all awesome
^
I mean I think of how generally awesome RD is
Then how cute RS is
Then how casually awesome AJ is
Never mind... This site is full of porn ads without adblock...
Dash is a show off @_@
It's just too much to choose from.
Dash deserves to show off.
xD
haven't watched a bird in the hoof in a while
All the other showoffs are assholes.
(Except The Great And Powerful Trixie)
No, she's an asshole too.
Trixie is an asshole but a loveable one
Suppose I could link the torrent file itself.
But she's cute, so it's okay.
any brony want to read my grimdark fan fic about an assassin pony? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYGz17QutniMWE5MxMFm2cmQ8gHpyNGr26I5BuxY2CA/edit?hl=en_US
I wonder if there's a widget for season 2 countdown
Lol
I marked it on my calender.
is that the one with the owl?
if its not on EqD it shouldnt be read
only 10 days till season 2 right?
I prefer to stay away from pony fanfics
My mom was like "Uhhh... what's MLPFIM season 2...?"
DerpyBot has a Season 2 countdown.
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:10m:51s
no that's "owl's well that ends well"
:D
Ah, right
Bird in the hoof... wow, doesn't ring a bell
/me will BBL
Brb, marking Beatles calendar
was it app proved?
so excited for new season :)
idk
a bird in the hoof is with the... whatever she's called... celestia's bird
we will see then
So, I finally decided to listen to that Pinkie Descent to Madness song.
Ahh!
Right
Holy crap
philomena or something?
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:09m:56s
Yes
I don't actually know which I'm more exited for
1.8/1.9 or Season 2...
I think Season 2.
Damnit
I only have purple markers
1.8/1.9?
Eh I can just link torrent file to unbranded 720p ponies in PM if anyone wants. D_D
i wonder how many seasons they will have
Minecraft.
Oh wait here's a yellow one
Win
oh, Season 2 for me
i wonder if it will be like more than 4 or something
Yeah same.
although the new updates for Minecraft are pretty epic
Ah! There we go!
how will i know if my story is approved?

All the way, woah woah
Don't let RainBro hear that...
My friend, whom I hadn't seen during the summer, ranted about how "people have become such big fans of some show called My Little Pony", and he thought it was weird as hell.
And there I was, sitting next to him, browsing ponychan
@MrPoni I'm not surprised, it's looks weird on the outside
!roll
hah
Spike'll sure be in for a hog-sized surprise when that last piece of ice melts
What if Spike drowned
And I was all like "Yeah, you were sayin'?" and showed my laptop
and then his head exploded from pony awesomeness?
!roll 1d26
Damn.

Too bad I didn't have any pony episodes on that laptop

Okay be right back, need to restart my VM
i saw the first episode once and i wanted to catch up before the new episode starts. it took me two days and i had to watch episodes untill episode 21 or something!
Otherwise I'd have started to watch one of 'em
Soundwave do they make d26s?
lol
He was all like "....okay"
@MrPoni should've shown him Inglorious Ponies
LoLZorZs: Any trolls around here specialising in innuendos + randomness + jokesLoLZorZs: and still make it sound good ;D?AtomicBrony: LoLZorZs: if by "innuendos" you mean "never", "randomness" you mean "gonna give" and "jokes" you mean "you up", then yes.
no not inglorious ponies
oh i o hate that movie
+s
Welp, we watched a few pony gmod videos and all after that, heh
All he could say after that was "okay"
Okay, time to start getting ready for audition

Ponies are everywhere
There are always ponies.
Yo dawg, we heard you like ponies.

Fluttershy knife is not assertive enough to harm anyone.

Fluttershy Knife that's almost like an oxymoron

I dunno, if you anger her enough...
The knife will make you love it.

/me slowly backs away
I know this is hard but I'm curious what's everyone's least favorite episode?
FUCK I LOST THE GAME
And then you'll be mine! MINE! AHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAwhoa!
@pony the pony who hates EVERYTHING
6 the pony who hates EVERYTHING is 7Applej8ack
Hm, Over a Barrel
over a barrel, yes
now that you mention it that's also probably my least favorite
not that i wouldn't like it
Same.
i just don't really get it
I'm torn between Over a Barrel and The Ticket Master
the mane cast is practically useless in that one
Ticket Master is great.
Sooo not truuu
I like the Ticket Master
/me shrugs
Call of the Cutie makes me want to flip tables.
Fireant jesli jestes online, odpisz - pilna sprawa techniczna
lol I love Fluttershy in the ticket master
It just felt all so redundant at the end
One of Celestia's finest trolling moments.
:O
why do people hate so much on call of the cutie
Jestem online.
I słyszę polski!
"we're just doing it for the ticket"
Magia.
i like call of the cutie
Call of the Cutie, I WANT IT NOW, Cupcakes, etc
i like twist a lot, too
moglbys dac /query?
A good Trollestia does not a good episode make, in my opinion.
Cupcakes...............
Not that I dislike the episodes, but
I wanted to NOT love and tolerate Silver Spoon / Diamond Tiara
DT is my least favorite pony.
you dont have to
there are things you should not tolerate
Methinks that was the point.
poor little silver spoon, looks like she's sixty years old, even though she's just a filly...
Donald Trump?
xD
I think silver spoon and diamond tiara are my least favorite ponies
Over a Barrel and Feeling Pinkie Keen were written by the same guy.

Ticket Master - "Oatmeal?! Are you crazy?!"
Oh, yes.
no one likes Diamond Tiara or Silver Spoon
I was just asking a question.
I know, right?
Fireant I can almost understand you
Every time I see "AppleDash[Game]" I lose the game.
I've seen admittedly cure pics, tho

lol
Except Magickese is 70% german 20% gibbberish and I dont know any german
"dunka dunka"
Michael89pl, rozumiem że kod potwierdzający rejestracje ci nie przyszedł na maila, tak?
The only Magickese words I know are Krief and Dunka Dunka
Ooh, good luck FreezeFrame
Any non-English language is clearly gibberish, herpderp.
Dunka Dunka is 'party'
And ohai Pinkie
that doesn't sound german at all.
dunka dunka is my favorite so far
рривет, тварешы!
Its not
Muhhumud Jihad.
xD
had to reload the page, i guess i missed a lot
I dont learn the german parts just the gibberish parts
ALLAH
ah.
Which is why when I speak magickese itrs just gibberish
i don't even grasp the concept of what you're saying, so okay
Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a terrorist pony.

lols
Yeah, beyond me. Sorry.
I just make stuff move around.
mmmmmmh
lol i hope they drop the scootabuse in season 2
there seem to be alot of bronies who like to animate Luna
that's pretty awesome by itself already
Nashy if mlp does a python reference I'm probably going to die of geeking out
Lol
Probably.

I want them to do a reference to Minecraft

Punch trees, get wood.
It's alike that or Rainbow Dash

IT MUST BE A REFERENCE TO RAINBOW DASH HURR

Hey Pinkie_Pie and Kodiak
What scootabuse?
"A French castle, here in Equestria? What are you doing in Equestria? Mind your own business!"
I didn't see any scootabuse in Season 1
i just think it makes Dash seem a bit too cruel and uncaring
"If you do not let us in, we will take this castle by force!" "You don't frighten us, Equestrian pigdogs! Go and boil your flanks, fillies of a silly mare! I blow my nose at you, so called questers! You and all you silly Equestrian keeerrrrnikkits!"
Grrrr I dun WANNA go to skuul..
You should.
Maybe you'll learn to spell "school".
BUT I DUNT WANNAAA. (THIS is whining)
not literal physical abuse, Barry :P
And some other words...
skuuuull.
I didn't even see any emotional or verbal abuse
Zuul!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs
School.
Umad?
no
zuul lol... i was thinking the same
/me tips Soundwave over
face it, the only abuse is what the fans misinterpreted from the show
Soundwave, I think you are a level 1 troll.
Let's take Owl's Well that Ends Well
So you better try to shake that impression from me.
All that's there is a fangirl willing to do anything for her idol, and Dash obliging her
"the holy apple-grenade of Antioch"
Troll is not a valid PC race.
Fireant, how do you get xp as a troll anyway?
GAH Troll tipping!
No need to make this a grand debate, jeez
Trolls have crappy level adjustment ;P
Must be some weird add-on.
What?
/me flails wildly and crashes to the ground
my brains feel like raw gibblets mixed in jello floating in a pool of conjealed gravy
So, cat food?
sure, why not
NO! I'm not cat food!
I'm just saying
/me scampers away
talking about cat food... anyone seen the movie District 9?
...nobody said you were?
"the beast approaches!" "what, Angel-bunny?"
/me gallops into the distance. "YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIVE!"
You're just saying that anyone who thinks Dash is too cold towards Scoota is wrong, yes, and you're entitled to that opinion.
/me scratches his name. "Weird pony..."
hey hey
ho ho
/me grinds to a halt. "I'm not weird, I'm just sensitive."
someponyelse brave brave Sir Robin has a Scootaloo on his shield
/me trebuchets a cow at Soundwave
Are you one of those who thinks an idol obliging their fan is abuse?
/me is crushed by a cow.
Unfortunately, I don't know the Sir Robin song well enough :<
lol thanks for the strawman
i think i know the lyrics to the knights of the round table
Exactly, it's all in fanart
and fan fiction
hmm but not the correct spelling of some of the words
We are the knights who say neigh!
Like Cupcakes
^
/me lies twitching in a heap under the fatal weight of the cow.
but there's just as much scootalove, if not more now, than scootabuse
poor Soundwave
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZwuTo7zKM8
STEINS;GATE, Y U SO EPIC
Another week of wait for the grand finale now
I'm pretty sure that's a Scootaloo on his shield
I never saw Scoots in Cupcakes, actually
/me flies in with an ear-to-ear smile
She wasn't, was she?
/me waves a greeting
Hello
it must have been an addition done by a different writer, if she was
Yes but there's this thing in the Cupcakes inspired askX.tumblr comic thingy
I'm not going to read through 50 different endings to it to confirm
That sounds like The Joker...
:/
having a good day?
I swear to god I'll ponify Steins;Gate OP with Dr. Whooves or something
ah askpinkaminadianepie.tumblr.com
Yes
YES
I returned.
omg, yes...
I know that one
To LASH my fury upon thee!
I don't like cupcakes, but those comics are really good.
Did your kitten return?
/me lash his fury.
/me lash to the right.
no...
I'm indifferent about the whole thing
/me cries
/me stands up panting. "What the hell...?"
/me lash to the left.
Aww....
oh, good days. rare pleasures indeed.
Sorry Jadenii
its fine
/me "Why was a cow thrown at me..."
V.V
fanfics obviously aren't canon, though
Should check out the Twilight tumblr where she reads cupcakes.
I'd like to be, but there's just something about that
neither is fanart
Ugh, I shall continue to love and tolerate this annoying router -.-
Holy mother of... Well... Wow...
and there's nothing in canon to support it
lol no shit?
the show's rated TV-Y, for crying out loud
/me limps back to join the herd. "That really hurt..."
Maybe it's because it's so detached from the source material...
http://ask-twilightsparkle.tumblr.com/post/9685158365/this-is-part-1-here-is-part-2
I have a feeling I'm missing something here...
/me displays a shockingly sad face.
Soundwave that's what you get for not appreciating a good Monty Python reference!
probably not much.
that's only season 1, now that they know about bronies they're clearly working on a Saw/FiM crossover :P
/me gasps. "I appreciate them all!"
lol
Probably, but still something.
Yep
I know what you're missing asdasasefasd! An intelligible screen name!
Saw/FIM crossover?
well, we're all doing our best, and that should be enough
it isn't, of course, but still.
haha
>_>
Maybe Cupcakes 2
lol Dashite
/me Declares loudly, "I'M GONNA DO AN INTERNET!"
Rainbow has to cut herself free or something
Part two is inception.
/me offers Jadeniis a cookie :3
I missed a poll. XD
I'm on the Internet!
/me smashes a key on his computer and is thrown back by the force of the rainbows being shot out of his compter.
Oh well, the one I would have voted for won anyway.
nah. i doubt the rating will go any higher than y7
Soundwave I saw that video
/me noms on the cookie and hugs Leika
asdfmovie4?
Good.
More people need to see it.
as did I
:D
I watched it all of 6 times
I still liked asdf2
The guy that made it PMed me.
same
/me "I wanna go to the moon."
*sigh*
"I baked you a pie!
I LIKE TRAINS.
First day of school
Over
>_>
/me "WHY WAIT!?"
We'll find out in 12 more days
xD
Finally
Ooo what flavor? "PIE FLAVOR!"
11
Oh my so much debate.
I don't think it would be any good if they made it for adults, really.
TomSka and me are good friends I like to think. xD
DIE, POTATO. *Potato pulls out gun* ...Not today.
x3
or even teens
I like trains.
My friend wore a Pinkie Pie shirt today
man, first day of school. gives you something to look forward to.
ohay Sumica
trains are nice
What you talkin bout?
It said 'A CUPCAKE IS NOT A HAT"
And were talking of asdf movie?
Ok then
My friend is going to do illustrations for Sweet Apple Massacre. Oh no.
Oh the things. All the things!
oh no pidgeons
Soundwave... whY?
*threw
KShrike I have no idea...
:(
Ugh, my spelling's horid today
Yeah,I wore a zebra hoodie backpack
Yeah, but a lot of kids shows do that
Soundwave: NOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
its a hoodie and backpack in one
There probably are cupcake illustrations somewhere... though I absolutely cringe at the idea
WHYYYYYY
I look like Zecora
:3
I've had those days...
true
look at rugrats
Is there any chance we could lay off the caps?
Whatever that is, it's most likely something I don't want to see... D_D
SAM is worse than cupcakes...
KShrike: one dude on devart is doing a comic :P
Soundwave, we don't talk about that
mhm, yes. it is.
people take cupcakes too seriousöy
it's full of it
ly
That awkward naked episode?
What rating you're talking about?
SAM is worse than anything
it's just a bunch of words.
ever
So tired............
it's like a little something for the parents who have to watch it, normally
its stupid, disgusting and shouldnt be mentioned
:P
Xiagu if they're too young to read it they're too young to be here.
not ture
Soundwave, that's um. actually. not true.
*true
its PG
this is pg, so... no?
I am 12
Soundwave, you're looking for #EquestriaAfterDark
and i am here
Lol
>:(
fantastic age
Is anyone there? o.O
who's to say, episode 1 of s2 is pretty dark
what Xiagu said
xD
*tap *tap is this thing on?
Soundwave, 61 ponies right now
I loved being 12
:P
from what i read, anyway
We still love you WhatPayne
that was before I learned... stuff
i missed out on being 12
and became scarred
Aww...
:3
lol
same.
"dark" is okay with kids shows though, as long as it's mostly implied
and pretty much every other age, too.
but i learned stuff at age 10
Barry: Read from where?
:D
we're debating fim's s2 rating
remember when joining EquestriaAfterDark..... things cannot be unseen
:(
eqd
Hmm
exactly, Iks
somewhere there
>.<
To be honest.....
I missed school today
lol i think it'll be the same as S1, pretty much... or so I hope anyway
asdasasefasd: not good
go to scool
They posted abuut that?
Not good at all.
if you don't
No pinkamina D:
appreciate school
Still
oh
It's too late.
you won't be able to talk with us
awwwwwww
*o
at least it gives you a place you can go to
the synopsis was leaked
Why won't I be able to talk with you?
Kooky
Because your life will get ruined
It's only one day...
:E
YAY
My alarm didn't go off.
I wonder what pony did that. . .
apparently the villain is some guy called Discord
...I also hope they do something more with Pinkamena in S2, so we'll get less psycho pinkie speculation...
oh noes
I really hope they do more with Pinkamena though
D:
and that's all i'm saying
I dont need an alarm
I use my phone as an alarm
My mom just wakes me up :3
And I put it on snooze
Then it fell under me >_>
my alarm is more or less broken
xd
RobotPinkie: *brohoof*
these days it just bursts lots of noise and static
Thanks Barry, because that's all I know of S2 <3
Psycho Pinkie came out long before episode 25
Well
It wakes you up
Does it not?
Oh wait? FIM season 2 rating?
Barry: Oh?
yes, but it's so annoying
/me brohoofs Kodiak
ohai SummerRain
that episode just cemented Psycho Pinkie as a personality of Pinkie
to the fans, anyway
WhatPayne: yeah
Yeah I guess...
Still, its objective is to wake you up
and yes, Kodiak, Cupcakes came out long before Party of One
oh hey
yes, i know.
And that wakes you up, So mission accomplished
/me glomps thunder-colt
/me giggles
it could do its job a lot better, though
Anything below TV-MA is no watch... Thank you very much.
Huh, never actually knew that
you know, workplace morale and stuff
before Cutie Mark Chronicles, even
/me hugs SummerRain
but it's really old, so i guess it's forgiveable
/me :3
AFK, what did I miss
to you, maybe, but FiM is and will always be a children's show
My alarm seems to screw me over some times
I'm leaving now
not... much?
I need to eat >_>
*sarcasm
but it helps that I have 2 roomates who also have an 8:50
lol
Parry of One and a few fanfics later, I am now in love with Pinkie
next time, add that to your post
>_>
TO THE KITCHEN
But I remember freshman year when I had a 7:40.... yuck
goodbye odd combonations of letters
I thought Pinkie was adorable in Party of One
Hey SummerRain. ^.^
/me reads his physics book
ghjguyuyuk
hiya....
/me reads his calculus book
Thought I was serious? :D
when i was in school, i got up around 6:00 most of the time
that was great
calculus in 3 dimmensions
:P
Same really. I just love how it revealed how broken she really is
you had to wake up at 7:40 AM?
._.
/me drops the bass..
Gotta love that
big deal
i have to wake up at five every morning
EPIC DINOSAUR LASER BATTLE
She just uses parties as a cover for her real self
SummerRain..... 7:40 is when class starts
>.<
True, but her flat hair look and slight shizophrenic attitude cemented Psycho Pinkie in the fans eyes
:(
ah
You aren't thinking very hard.
same same
lol
that's awesome
what's this about everything being bold in this channel, now?
(well c'mon.. i wasnt supposed to)
>uses ChatZilla. doesn't see anything weird
JadeniisENGAGED: Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal.
:P
In fact I cherish the fact that ratings do not mean good/bad. I'm really happy that a show meant for little children can be so damn good.
If that were true, her cutie mark wouldn't be balloons
xD
/me bounces joyfully around the room
That reminds me. . .
this chat is too good at eating my time, even when Im not talking 8|
are spongebob and Rocko's Modern Life chopped liver?
lolol they'd be red balloons
Soundwave: you so cute
i like to have my time eaten
:S 10 days until season 2. <Applebloom> But, I want it NOW!!!
/me smiles and continues
daww
/me maliciously trips Soundwave up
Any of you heard the song "Even the Happiess Pony Gets Sad Sometimes, Right?"?
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:17h:03m:44s
WOOT!
play nice
:(
Season 2!!!!1
so far away
I dunno, I don't think it's a cover she uses, it's genuinely her special talent to lift the spirits of others
:(
/me yelps and crashes into the ground. "GAH!"
I hate waiting
nope, never heard of it
That makes all of september worth it :)
Could be farther, then I would have gotten a better library
/me whistles nonchalantly
hey, don't hate on September, my birthday is in September
because... that's what the show says :P
So... what's the better pony breed? A unicorn, or a pegasus (say Alicorn, and you lose). You have to choose one or the other.
that should be a poll
pegasus
KShrike, you forgot earth pony
G2g.
definately
winged unicorn
confound these ponies on my screen!
It's just a matter of her being so used to being involved in party planning that when she was ignored, she couldn't take it
earth ponies are way better
i'mma earth poneh
So did anyone ever get a good idea of what House's cutie mark would look like?
Xiagu: who cares about earth ponies... unless they get magic in s2
Earth, Pegasus Or unicorn?
HMmmmm
Pegasus
or some kind of magic
I prefer pegasi myself, but if I had to pick a tank, I would go earth pony all the way
^^^^
RobotPinkie: True, but it's fun Having a different view of her ;)
Bottle on vicodin
I'm thinking it would look like a piece of a puzzle.
*of
Which is the better breed, or which do I prefer? Very different questions
KShrike, because the other two kinds aren't as strong as earth ponies?
Pegasus ponies are best ponies.
Indeed
Unicorns>EveryPony
nuff said
Unicorns are the better breed as they can accomplish the most, but as for preference...hm.
Barry: ah. You should listen if you're a Pinkie fan :p
I can't decide. I kinda want to be that jedi kind of guy (unicorn), or do I want to be the athlete with freedom (pegasus)
earth ponies kind of screwed over by life, but they just smile and accept it and go on like everything's alright
lol chomping down on vicodin being a special talent? :P
They have an entire city to themselves
i wish i could be like that
Earthponies best ponies.
NO
They don't need horns/wings to be awesome.
I don't think that all pegasi are as athletic as dash, btw.
If you survive, then yes
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
They do it all themselves. >:3
Pegasus Ponies ftw
I'll assume earth ponies are faster and stronger
Excuseeee me?
She's sort of an outlier.
but... they don't have as much fun.
pegasus ponies have an entire city for themselves
If Ponies were rpg classes for me it'd be
I would love to be a pegasus, fly with freedom.
also, earth ponies are stronger
Pegausus = high in attack with lots of speed
/me soars through the air, backflipping and such
Piece of puzzle would be more fitting to the whole cutie mark lore
>:3
Earth = High in defense
Unicorn would be magical
Unicorn = Magic duh
AlwaysSunny, I disagree
I'm sure Earth Ponies and Unicorn Ponies have their own cities...
I would probably be a unicorn, if given choice.
KShrike: my thoughts exactly
FluffyWuffs, Canterlot is a unicorn city
^this
wait, really?
(Nashy) Kind of like RPG archetypes, Warriors are strongest and toughest, Rogue/Archer types are agile and fast and spellcasters have OMGMAJICKS.
They should do that in the MLP online game
D_D
Honestly thopugh I'd be happy to just be a pony.
my special talent would be arguing about ponies online...
As most of the cutie marks are ambiguous
I've had 2 dreams on flying, one when I was a preteen, and one recently.
Being able to pick a pony type with its own perks
I keep coming back to that line.
if you noticed, throughout the episode, Pinkie was getting more and more frustrated with her friends ignoring her, so when Spike "confirmed" her suspicions, all her emotions just exploded like a balloon
But none of them involving ponies
wow
AlwaysSunny, I would give Earth ponies high Atk/Def, for melee. Pegasi get high speed / agility or whatever, and are very accurate and have multi hit weak attacks or crits, depending on system.
Xiagu: Good God... you can't be serious
i probably should be a pegasus based on my body
:P
but
flying is my life
KShrike, you hating?
Nah
KShrike, also wait, what's wrong?
Pyroh: Which means Twilight is a good mage
:3
Like pegasi being able to go to clouds dale, Unicorns donig magic and earth ponies....Probably quicker with physical work or something
It blew my mind when I noticed that Pinkie Pie actually looses some colour when she got depressed
i'mma EP
could be*
but
Just trolling, Xiagu. Just trolling.
i shouldnt be
she lost all the happiness the Sonic Rainboom from so long ago gave her, and had to find new happiness
!link word_of_faust magic
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/8275
Friendly trolling
confound these trolls on my irc
KShrike, well I mean if you actually disagreed at all I'd like to hear it
kinda sad to forget your own birthday, though...

/me claps
That's cliche
IS SCHOO CUTE
Yeah but I mean for Pinkie, her own birthday should be something very special, I thought...
woona
she never celebrated it before, either
lol thought until I saw that episode anyway
I bet
Does anyone really forget their own birthday IRL?
no, but they forget their girlfriend's birthday all the time!
/me desperately searches around for an insulin shot
haha, true that
or boyfriend's
Cutie Mark Chronicles gave us some insight to her home life, and it seemed like Parties weren't something they did
bah
Pony desktop sprites
would you remember your birthday if you never celebrated it?
get in the way!
Actually it looks like parties were the last thing to cross their minds
or would it feel like a normal day
I know right? I mean a rock farm? What's the point of that?
I guess that's true, Barry
Cutie Mark trumps race.
She can't really fly though.
Fluttershy has her own personalities though
It's like Rarity's special talent being a gem finding spell that Twilight can copy
don't judge
:O
Not so special anymore
Twilight is OP
ahahah
Nashy: yes she is
was it ever explained why Fluttershy was changed to a Pegasus and Pinkie to earth pony?
WhatPayne: Pegasi make snowflakes, doesn't really surprise me that they would make rocks either :p
At this rate, with all the games and stuff they are making
KShrike, yes, I wondered when somepony would bring that up
Point AllisZero
Even if the show ends, MLP will live on for a LONG
Xiagu: I did a long time ago. Nopony listened
LOOOOOOOOONG time
KShrike, they're clearly more guidelines than actual rules, although AJ was a bawss at stopping that stampede
And then G5 ponies will exist*
Rarity's special talent isn't gem finding though
and everyone will rage
But I hate Rarity, so I couldn't care less if her special talent was worthless
it's design
Not really any kind of rock, but maybe rocks for construction, pavement or something like that
Hi E_N
KShrike, and Rainbow Dash is pretty athletic for a pegasus
!!!!
Rarity's special talent is working with gems. Finding, using, everything.
Im pulling stuff off of it.
RARITY IS AMAZING
Hypocrit
They be fashionable!
I love and hate Rarity
Then why were they ferrying the rocks back and forth?
^
i like rarity a lot
she's a drama queen ;_;
The problem I have with Rarity.... goodness, she is basically justifying bedazzling everything!!!! AHH! IT BURNS!!!!!!
she reminds me so much of Frasier for some reason
That, and she is an absolute b**ch
Rarity uses people.
and frasier was my favorite show before mlp came along
Raritree.
Whines.
Probably to try to make geodes
Nashy: How?
How the hell did you get owner?
And all she can do is make dresses... yay...
she used the diamond dogs...
I already had a rant about how much I hate Rarity... so.... if anypony had the chat log, so I don't have to go through it again.
I think it's more the gems inside geodes than it is the racks themselves
A wizard did it
rocks*
She uses Spike mostly.
Now, what is the command for me to give you permanent owner?
yeah
wow, i havnt listened to the cupcakes song for about 2 hours
So that we both can have it
thats a new record!
Well the sonic rainboom making her hair like that seems pretty likely
!
So pinkie is like Joker? Always tells different story?
Why does spike have to do everything?
she knows he loves her
Manipulating his affection for personal gain.
I like Rarity...
<.>
He doesnt even get payed for it
Something Broke or one of the actual songs of the in-show Cupcakes song
Spike is a lucky pony...
I don't think she uses Spike so much as Spike volunteers so willingly
lol maybe that's it
something broke, of course
FluffyWuffs: Spike isn't a pony
:(
./cs SOP #Bunker ADD E_N
ssoooo yeah
Meh
You wanna know how I got this cutie mark?
That will give me admin
I haven't listened to it for two days
It's pretty much like owner
WHO WANTS TO COME TO MY WEDDING WITH LEMON_LIME?
Thanks for reminding me :P
:D
i listen to it all the time, mostly on repeat
Would you want to remember the full story of your homelife if you lived like Pinkie, let alone share it to impressionable children?
<.<
Dig up all these gems, I'll give you ONE of them.
and now Pinkie's wife can't stand the sight of her :(
its already practically burned into my brain
Also, everypony, you notice how in Ep 1 Spike said he hatched from a purple and green egg, but the egg is just purple in ep 23
Yeah, agree
INCONSISTENCY!
Wedding?
uhhhhh
I can't listen to it too often, because when I listen to it I stop doing everything else
I am disappoint
Ok?
strange to get married at age 12
yesh xD
lol, its rp
:D
WHY
KShrike there are tons and tons of inconsistencies
As long as i get cake, That's usually why i go to weddings
SO
CUPCAKES
For cake
I know right tho?
Wat
Iks... I still love the show
I'm just saying
me too
Why so cupcakes he asked.
She probably made the whole thing up to save herself, and the CMC the grief
Let's put a muffin in that mouth!
lol
its amazing how often applejack loses her freckles
haha
Rarity and Fluttershy are my favourite
i've attended 2 weddings so far: my uncle's and my brother's
I turned my friend into a brony. It wasn't hard, see madness, as you know, is like gravity all it takes is a little push
/me is playing: 1596. MLP-FIM - At the Gala  3:16 - 192kbps
She had more when she was a filly
Iks, *1-up noise*
I was watching that hour long blooper video before it was cool!
yep
I don't want to watch that.
Well maybe Pinkie had a really awesome time growing up, with tons of parties
im talking about rp xD
Well, at least the majority of these inconsistencies are only little slip ups
Its pretty funny
Then you start noticing those things.
And they annoy you.
Iks, the egg thing is more legit though since Spike actually said what color it was and then it was the /wrong color/
as opposed to minor things
The lose there appendages and stuff
i know, but i'm talking about weddings now
Fluttershy crashed my Firefox
Pretty entertaining
lol
...hmmm, nah, I think it's more likely that she invented parties
yeah but thats what you get with like 10 writers
oh, mkay
never been to one
But she seemed so nice...
>.<
Hey, I saw the script for Season 2 E1 Act three
Seriously. I clicked on Fluttershy's song (Hush Now, Quiet Now) and it crashed
I think Pinkie invented fun parties
SPIKE STARTED OUT AS AN EGG
It looks so much more dark than Season 1
Your firefox went to sleep

No

I wont spoil anything

hiya Fall
we don't have enough facts about spike's early life so whatever
:D
Your argument is now more invalid than before
I really don't care that much
unless
lolwat
It's not like I watch it for that plot or anything

In fact, it can be.
Is this Thursday's live stream like a test?
I watch it for the "other" plot
It's PROBABLY a dragon...
Spike is gonna grow an awesome mustache later on in life?
Hellew
But of course
And that's jenga
=P
damn... i so love the singing voice of twilight
so we know if it'll work for next Saturday?
o.O
time for PONIES?
/me hugs Luna
/me collects fluffywuffs head bits
TO THE KITCHEN!
There are 2 other dragons.
I'm going AFK for a while, gotta eat
I haven't hugged Luna today yet!
There are people making a pony kart racing game
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-HCk6emBg&feature=related
Okay
Piiiiinkie you've got to stand up tall, learn to face your fears
Maybe one is Spike's mommy?
/me hugs Luna
Hi, Luna
/me hugs Luna
I'd hate it if Spike met his parents in season 2
The ones in Dragonshy and Owls Well that Ends Well have male voices
They're dragons.
Well the red one is most obviously a male
lol, do you think its funny if a 12 year old girl is BISEXUAL? or lesbian?? I am straight, but my friends are already choosing their sexual prefrences and have made out with girls- THERE ONLY 12 AND 13.
yeah
Huge dragons.
07A wild stream appeared
Voice, Lack of eyelashes
Ohai Luna
They may as well be female.
I would face my fears, but it costs 50 dollars. (Dead Island) XD
the blue/green one also lacks eyelashes
So im assuming its a male
could be Nashy, could be...
That would be rich if it was the real Fluttershy singing that, considering she didn't face her fear of dragons until her friends were troubled
y gaems so expesnive?
ROFL oh you :3
well, let them do whatever they want, it's not like anyone knows what the heck is going on anyway
JadeniisENGAGED well that is because they are totally brainraped by the medie, society and the chemicals in the food
*media
But spike is green and that dragon is red, Although scale colour may not depend of the parents scale colour
In a way, Fluttershy does sing that, Barry :p
oh and the school system
What are we listening?
and she takes weed
and watches porn
spike is a different type of dragon... or did you see the other ones breathing magical fire?
You already chose your sexual preference too.
(wth???)
Jad, EAD
Spike could have recessive genes too
I sense hypocrisy.
does she kill people?
I know, but we were born straight.
No.
/me is confused because of the conversation walked in on.
Yes, read the bible.
lol bible
/me ate his bible
JadeniisENGAGED like i said... kids these days are bucked up... you are probably the exception that is normal
the bible is pretty old
i think
some kind of giggle at the ghosties instrumental
Well spike may be adopted, Because where else would they get the egg unless the mother did not want it
My #1 source for information on everything... Or not.
might not be suitable reading material these days
Oh yeah, I went there. Jesus is my savior, have a problem?
pretty old? Try centuries
i dont know you after all
I have a problem with your prejudice.
But still, if your friends were in danger of a dragon, could you actually face it, knowing it could kill you?
Interesting
and to this day, 'people' are still editing the bible
Maybe they will explain in season 2
lol
Who knows
oh, come on, no religious discussions please
I think every day someone has said Kids these days...
these things never end well...
not sure if JadeniisENGAGED is troll
i AM NOT
doesn't matter anyway
/me shrugs
Prejudice has no place here.
KershaFangs: I still say that
let's just agree on the following:
i am a grown up... i dont believe in the bible or religion in general
we are all wrong
Hey bronies, I need a bit of help.
all the time
but, seriously.
the end.
hm?
Jad....I dont think he/she qualifies as a troll
Yet
no, not the end.
07With what?
/me doesn't want to have this whole religion topic in this channel
please
its my religion...
I don't have anything against religious people, but when they wave it in my face..
I mean, I am stopping now, but...
It was said to my mother, and her mother. Every day these kids are getting worse.
look, it's okay that you're religious
I don't believe that.
^
^this
it's just we don't want to talk about religion
really.
I'm feeling a bit conflicted. I know I'm supposed to be loving and tolerance of people, but some of them just make it hard
^^^^^above that
^^
Yeah, I stopped.
okay.
Embrace the power......OF RELGION!
07how so?
SO ANYWAY
but, yeah
i don't think you have to tolerate everyone...
HOW BOUT DEM PONIES?!
Everypony drop.
hiya Hays
/me drops.
/me also drops
just saying, its kind of young to know if your gay, bi, lesbian, trans, etc.
<Rocky. I'M JUST GLAD NONE OF DEM PONIES SHOWED UP.
/me drops a stack of plates.
first of all
okay,the end
Jadeni is not a troll
OMG last word!
Rocky is pony-ist.
she is saying what her dang religion is
second
Thank you
I don't either, as long as you don't drop to their level
yeah is doesnt freaking matter
we know
lol KershaFangs
problem?
HAHAHAHA
lets all drop it
oh btw
Howdy, everypony.
I be back
Howdy, Mason
I knew that
/me returns to physics book
How are yall today^
Yo, mason
everyone does seem to have a problem.
weve all had that top pocket idea, never works out
/me huggles SummerRainlAFK
wb
Hehehe... was just trying to explain why My Little Pony Friendship is Magic is being watched by a bunch of guys.... I'm getting better at explaining it successfully when I mention Power Puff Girls.
I'm good
The problem is the intolerance. Whether you use religion or anything else to justify it is irrelevant.
ohay Dermathil
lag
Most people here probably at least watched a few PPG episodes
I know I did
Shoo bee doo, Shoo shoo be doo~
has there been an orchestral version of Giggle at the Ghostly yet?
what is this?
i never watched power puff girls, i was too stupid back then
i'm stupid now, too
I own the entire PPG box set.
Frickking Sea Ponies in my head all day!
Nashy: Religion also gets in the way
just, in a different way.
:o Pony Kart?
NASHY, DROP IT >.<
yes
some people say physics
lets drop it
/me powers his game of Space Marine up so he can smash some more orkies to bitsies
some people say other stuff
Mojo Jojo is best cartoon villain.
IMO
WHO CARES
/me drops it
i watched PPG and dexters lab on cartoon network back when we received it per sattelite... best way to learn english
Lol, Mojo-Jojo.... best name ever
/me had already dropped.
cool
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfeaIiDc8kw
Like, it's own game? Not just a mod for Mario Kart?
https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/15497387/1/Flying?h=0d77b6
Ugh, so sorry for that
ooh, wrong chat
oh, oh
My screen locked up. Did any of that go through?
so uhh
Uh oh... ^_^;
i mostly learned english by playing imported video games
i dont get why people compare MLP to powerpuff girls
MLP is way better
and different
ImO
IMO
PPG got help from Faust
ikr
Anyone can explain why Ponies are at the top of Memebase?
ehh, its nothing i dont want people to see
they compared it because of Faust
o.O
and ponies
Because Ponies.
because ponies are SO AWESOME!!
PPG and ponies have a lot of simularities really
I like both
not to me
a good series that ended
i'd rather watch..
OMG guess what? i got a hoodie backpack. its a hoodie jacket with a backpack attached :3
and another that took it's place
Look in my hand, two tickets to that thing you enjoy. Look again, the tickets are now PONIES.
something stupid than PPG
Its a zebra, and it makes me look like zecora
no offense
07is anyone watching the stream?
seems like it might be difficult to wash properly
i didnt even know about Lauren until MLP
:3
^me neither
any of what?
yeah its very laggy though
and yeah, i am Luna
I knew, I knew!
07hmm yea steam is open
07i'll close it soon
I knew about her husband though
i honestly think the fame starts and stops at MLP
I've got it on my second screen while playing Borderlands.
followed a lot of his works
RobotPinkie: What I just posted
ah okay
Didn't know her till Foster's, though. She posted a couple times on the "Never Forgotten" fan forum.
Make your hoodiebackpack into a hoodiebackpack with earphone drawstrings.
I KNOW HER
I think so
CAUSE HER HAIR IS PINK
I really love her hair

!moon
Grab my tail, thunder-colt!
Thunder, we are the best.

/me brohoofs thunder-colt
pft. homework
well, now i'll never know.

lucky
I have Calculus. I need ponies to maske me happy before I realize I am horrible at math...
:D
so i feel inclined to return

It doesn't work as well, thunder-colt, when you're set to auto-join. ^^;

07[22:16] <RobotPinkie> i don't think you have to tolerate everyone...
gtg bye

Attempting to escape us, that is.

/me snuggles thunder-colt
07I agree to this
Well some of my assignments are online based so I CANNOT do it at school.
homework was nice
I'm back >_>
Awesome

Homwork isn't nice.
Online assignments are awesome
Clearly not with a real nick.

But then I'm online, and then ponies.

lol
thunder-colt
wat
XD nice
we sorta had to do something
like that
but i am shameful
I think you should give people the benefit of the doubt, though... that far I'd extend my loving and tolerating :P
we never had anything like that at my school
u no put ponies?
Thunder, I had friends who had to do that. I'm so gladly I didn't have to.
Furthest I'm willing to go is fluttershy sketches in my math notebook >_>
aigh
*sigh

Unidentified, we meet again!!
asdfghjkl

Wait what questions?
6I would like to be stuck in one of those. . . With all of the fluffies! :DD
SO GUYS, GO HERE FOR DESKTOP PONIES: http://desktopponies.co.cc/
they asked me about my homewwork
I see.
Why would they do that?
just don't put like, 100+ ponies on your screen
ahahahahaha
dunno
but
cause it involves ponies
it's lag
It does?
._.
Agreed.
That's why I'm a double major at the university
long story short, yeah, ill be putting a pony in an about me bag and the class has to guess me, for my bag
its anonymous
Congrats Violet
She looks a bit scared though
it will lag***
Desktop Ponies, yay!
if you put too many ponies
XD
I had that
haha
I currently have about 10 derpy's on my scren
o_O
O.O
I derped it
XD
07PASSWORD!
I had derpy flying around my screen so fast I couldn't click her
Task manager was no help
LOL
lol
6XD
Hmm, I wonder if I should get the more tam version...
I had to delete everything related to desktop ponies
oh wow
*tame
xD
What is this anyway?
That way there aren't ponies in the qway of my writing
*way
07IT Crowd

Muffin!
6D: His poor matchset. . .
for some reason, i suddenly recall our first computer
it had 12 mhz
WAIT WHAT JUST why am I in caps?
i think it played tetris
Nice. XD
I'm lolling so much because I can understand a little Italian
lol
12mhz
good lord!
I wonder what it would be like if I ever went lower than 200mhz
ah, it played mamba, too.
windows 3.1
ohai Razyn
lol, I loved ME
and 98
Ohai there.
GGGala
everyone seemed to love 98, i never got to try it
I never used 2000 D:
we went from 3.1 to 95, which we used for years
channel's a little dead atm >_>
and then xp.
This one?
My first was 95
3.1 was DOS
yeah, this one. well BS is also slow.
if you talk OS
Are we talking about computers now?
welll... yes
07he's not here I think
If so, I cannot contribute. ;-;
actually, my first os was linux
but I never used it all that much
I have seen a video that has greatly boosted my self esteem. I now know that I will never be the world's biggest nerd
Darn
Ok, I have to ask, and pardon my ignorance, VioletVanilla, how long have you've been a mod?
i hardly even remember all that 3.1 stuff, though, since my brother was the one doing things with it
ME was horrible and i avoided 2000 cause I knew from experience at work that it was horrible
Because I have now heard the MLP themesong... in Elvish
i just kind of watched and didn't understand a thing
My first OS was 95
dari and dashite i'm pretty sure are afk
Whee, now I have a brushable Pinkie Pie
ME wasn't that bad
I loved it more than XP
shush FluffyWuffs
XD
07She joined the crew last weekend
you are a computer noob
07;-)
back when I were younger*
Windows 3.1 for me
oh boy, IT crowd
How much did I miss?
Oh, I thought I was crazy not noticing that sooner...
Well, this one is notorious for being slow before the evening.
oh hai Apokalipse
Hi InsertCupcake
The only one I skipped was ME after that.
071 ep Apo
ah, alrighty
And then that horrid OS
vista...
Oh, before I forget
/me hugs Luna
07Nah she needs to be added to the about page
I had to stick with XP for another 2 years
Turn off
Turn on
Alwasy works
i've seen vista ruin a lot of things
My old machine still runs 98 SE
i'm glad i never had to use it for anything
Well... "runs" might not be the right word
Oh goodie stream is up
i can do it
power off
power on
Meh. I never had any problems with vista
VioletVanilla: And congratulations Violet :0
oh, yeah. shouldn't be too much longer.
And that too, I tried to search, but did not find her name
Shadowmane...?
I got like, blue screens for almost anything with vista
yes razyn?
even booting up the dang thing
i'd go to university, someone had prepared a presentation
6Thank you both very much! :3 I do need to be added to that. . .
using vista.
Ah, I love when my internet is running at proper speed
it would NEVER work.
oh wait, we're missing somebody.
You remind me of another younger bloke...
^lol
ShadowMane's here
Lol
I hear that quite often. Probably my boy
I know I was a lucky bastard
I think I am the only person who doesn't have a problem with their Vista.
Windows 8 looks promising
640 Kbps download speed is lovely, though I really do nwish I could get more. But faster internet is so much more expensive.
No browser!?
for a smart phone OS
aha
well, use whatever works for you
640k is alright
i am using XP for 10 years now
and pray that it will keep working
But then again I had a 2000 that had 3 different major viruses destroy its performance.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Mason_Trowel: my phone has faster internet than that :s
BUTTON FOR THE INTERNET
Oh dear god I would so rage like that.
It downloads fast than 640 Kilobytes?
i have about 300 kbps, i'd never need more than that
My internet speed in bits is 6 Megabits.
/me FluffyWuffs|brb
I get about 3mbps
ffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I have to go
...is what i'm saying now, i guess.
Whorses
The scary thing is, someone, somewhere, has said that...
But that amounts to DL speed of about 600 Kilobytes.
:o
waaat
I am scandalized, asdasasefasd
I don't know my internet speed. It's nice.
MakerDusk, your internet is crazy fast
mines okay
By the way, are you from the New Hampshire Asdasasefasds?
come to think of it, i'm never quite sure of it, either
but it screws up
A LOT
i don't really care, anyway
Confound you Luna. I have homework. And I cannot stop watching this.
I also rarely have problems with my router...
Mason_Trowel: that's only the internet on my phone...
Hi there! :D
oh, we always have LOTS of problems with our routers
Hi
routers hate our family
hello
07i'm sowwy!
hey
ohai PinkiusPiacus
07just one more ep
Hi there~
Hmm...
Our CURRENT router works fine!
Yes Luna, you make me not sleep.
Our previous router... not so much
Usually burn out fast
I wasn't sure if PinkiePie was taking so I decided to be PinkiusPiacus because that's a funny name hehe.
I think it barely qualified as a router
I've gone through a few but we change after they have their anttenas snapped off.
It was better used as a heated paperweight
Well, it would just deny you if PinkiePie was here
Pinkie_Pie is taken, and I think there is a PinkiePie
...
/me loves Nightmare Moon
-gasps- It made my name green!
huh!
/me hugs Luna
hahaha
Our new one works great, but it's all weird shaped and we had to rest it on a clock, lol
what
I had a printer that had a broken wheelie thing so it could only take in paper from one side and always jammed for it.
Couldn't just stand it up like the last one
That was my footrest for a month
That was epic
HAHA
MFW
oh wow
Lol screw you Ben Genderson!
lol
hey
yeah, printers are a story of their own
I dont think I have seen a PinkiePie
Oooh there was an evil laugh, wasn't there?
yup
RAVE
yes there was
6Eeyup~
How do you do that?!
That was so cool!
soundboard of course
I just finished listening to Rap is a Man's Soul, and now I want to punch a block of granite into the shape of a giant fist
Magic
Luna is controlling the stream
you'd break your hand
Eh, My mistake. Lol
PinkiusPiacus are you new here?
Not with that song playing, I wouldn't
Oh my goodness! There's a Pinkie_Pie! Hi there!
07We will have many new people around on Thursday
6I rode on a bus like that in Munich. . . Same seats I think o:
We will?
OI had a really mean one. It was my sister's so I had to be REALLY careful with it... every time I tried to print something it would make a different set of noises and just stop as if it broke. Only after a bout of pleading would it finally print, all nice.
oh? what's thursday, Luna?
Oh god, Thursday
07eeeyup
6Luna's right! c;
A test of the Hub streaming, right?
Now if only we had a Pinkamena Pie
What happens on Thursday
/me still doesn't know what is streaming thursday
Hi PinkiusPiacus =P
07exactly
Oh look it's Luna.
/me tackle hugs luna
Hi! -hugs Pinkie_Pie- I LOVE other mes!
Or is it me's?
Oh well!
07gently please
test stream of the hub...
I think with that song playing, a man could beat an aircraft carrier in a fistfight
=D, me to!
i couldn't
(Not that Equestria can handle more than one of us)
Yes. For the sake of science, Shadowmane.
i couldn't even beat my printer
/me tosses Sumica out a window to hug Luna.
-laughs, bounces in a cirlce-
circle*
07ahahaha
07:D
because that's the deal with printers
Then you aren't playing it loud enough!
lol
http://youtu.be/ipy1ZJQeUcs
suddenly!
they're possessed by an unknown force that hates mankind
-gasps- What?!
um, i... i don't particularly like rap.
But... Kamina!
im going to bed now
Because most rap is terrible, shallow and materialist.
cya
I don't usually like rap either. But... Kamina!
good night
Hi
and i don't know what kamina is?
hihi everypony
This song is actually just about breaking boundaries and being more than you could normally be
Whoa! What happened?!
Heya
i tried being more than i could be
it didn't work
Was gonna tell you, if you want, you can use a - instead of _ (Pinkie-Pie)
I invited you to a channel
I mean, why is my name red? o-o
At the top, you can click on Bronystate to switch between tabs
Woah, I saw the invite in the main channel
Did you try it with this song playing?
now i'm back to not being what i could be
that's at least easier.
Red?
/me didn't know this happens
yep
ahahaha
haha
again with the kissing
But it's only red when I type!
i'm sure that, if that song were the background music to my entire life, things would be way better
Mine is yellow =o
but it's not, so... too bad.
oh god
9What?
I think its so you can see where you are easier
7Orange is best pony
This thing doesn't do voice chat does it? Awwww.

7Because Spitfire is best pony

9Lime is best pony
13I disagree

13Lime = Dashie?
7You mean apple fritter?
Dashie~

-glomps RDash-
I can top that.
haha
9Well, Rainbow is a rainbow
9So any color=Dashie

Geeeyood morning equestria!

Weeeellll I'm really a tombrony but I LOVE talking like PinkiePie
Brilliant accent

football is just a jumped up excuse for men to relieve their repressed homosexual urges
ohay, just noticed Wrek is a full op now? congrats.
Luna, where do you get these episodes? I keep forgetting.
its a tribal thing
AJ and Dash's FAVORITE sport
okay...?
13I wish I could talk like her, I would terrorize my friends if I could
Totall canon
13Lol
07xbmc
hey DecapKing
Awwww I already terrorize my friends, hehe. ^^
for them to feel good about themselfs while the world around them turns into a cesspit
07or boxee
No seriously
That's because here at college I have a bunch of irl brony friends and I love speaking like Pinkie Pie and it freaks them out.
link?
Why else would large sweaty glistening hairy men throw themselves at each other
in mud?
watched by zillions of others?
Oh, dear sweet Celestia! So much pony!
I DEMAND A RECOUNT!
I should tell everybody that next time they yell over football.
Nevermind
THINK ABOUT IT

9I don't know any irl bronies...yet ^.^
Or
y'kniow
both
13Also, I would be thrilled to hear someone talk like Pinkie
9Hey meteorventure
You can really only see the player's forearms, it's less homoerotic than you're imagining
at the same time
yes, i didn't want to go there.
Yes you did
hmmmm
4I DEMAND A RECOUNT!
you're just to pansy
however
I! however
oh wait
when it comes to professional football
4I DEMAND A RECOUNT!

its bread and circus
it gives me super powers
its a distraction
13A recount...?
Weelllll if you want to hear me talk I have a livestream account ^^
they're probably doing it because they get paid millions and millions of dollars
grown men on tv talking about throwing a ball around
Yeah, that to

cause everyone is only interested in football
War can't stop
shit
War in general, not so much.
they know all the scores of every game the past 10 years but dont know the 3 branches of government
Well modern athletics began in Classical Greece
13So, Pinkius, you gotta teach me how to be a better Pinkie actor one of these days
13Lol

Very warlike place, but they did meet to have sporting contests outside of these wars
It's wine
Okay!
war in the middle east... making the world safe for central banking
4I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO THE CREATOR OF THIS CHANNEL!
Greek and Roman sports were pretty brutal, though.

Ohmygosh, Applebloom for Desktop Ponies is ADORABLE! :D
ok lady metaphore
Alright
If you want to hear me talk you can click that >3>

Before that... whatever happened to DecapPony?
Was there a coronation?
11He's out at the moment
13Okay, Lol

11May I take a message?
The losing team would be sacrificed

Hey there, Sketchy! You enjoy your snooze?
but I rather do other things
oooooh, she's so cute lol XD. I can't get enough
I did yes thank you.
i used to play soccer when i was... 10? 12?
lolwut
snooze, I could use one of those... but I'll have to do it later
mostly out of peer pressure, though
reading the "newsworthy" fic.....
I still play football
What position?
Corner
Rose pony gets a decent part in it and it makes me squeeeeeeee
i... really don't remember
petal stool. like a flower you sit on.
It's fun
is that guy from something else?
titty million?
But not important to me in the least bit
I don't know any soccer positions except goalkeeper, not really familar with that sport
Titty million.
funny thing is, i didn't even really know the rules when i played
i just kind of went along with what people told me to do
Sounds like my Little League career
um
I want that suit!
for the gala
"You.....stand in the outfield, 10 year olds can't hit that far."
sounds like an easy enough job.
I remember playing baseball, just sitting in the grass wait for the ball to roll by you
dem wigs
whats with the wigs?
Their British
then throwing it to a random person
Oh god!!
well i know that
omg
that's always a good idea
I want out
I don't even remember the last time I played baseball.
I'm so sorry everyone.
hahahaha
oh wow
as soon as you get rid of the ball, it's not your responsibility anymore.

Twilight says the library only has pictures from e621 and ponibooru, videos from youtube and books from google docs.
Aww.
hahahaha
Oh, well, pic is still adorable.
dat skype
I just got told, by a supposed Pony fan, that I am the worst person in the world simply because...
I'd hug Ditzy
I like Fullmetal Alchemist
I would hug everypony
wanna hear me talk like Pinkie Pie? http://www.livestream.com/kimiart
I think it would have been fun to have a Pony-themed Fantasy Football league, bit late for that though
BTW Pony Kart is something pretty old.
FMA is not that bad...
That's been going on for quite a long while.
I'm a girl irl btw
They're all so huggable.
they probably wouldn't want to be hugged, though
And I don't think there are quite enough ponies for a full Fantasy Football League
I'd hug anypony if my sheer weight wouldn't kill them.
13Orly
I'll click that link after IT Crowd
if whoever she likes doesn't like her, that pony isn't a real pony!
07me too
He needs to go hom and be a family pony!

9Dari, how is that your host name?! Inquiring ponies need to know! :P
inb4 Harry Potter ref
Is there a statistic about the male/female ratio of the brony fandom?
You can request whatever you want your host to be with HostServ.
i see you there!
I got the link to this picture off the page for the fic "Get Along Home". It's the only shipping fic I ever WANTED to read on the site. And it is adorable.
I'd like to know too
What a shock
Micheal Vick Pony

Hey, all.
hi.
So far, Luna and PinkiusPiacus are the only female bronies I've met lol
lolwut
Or /hs request whatever.you.want.here
Depending on what format you want.
Also I'd like to know EqD visitor age distribution too
Hey
SO this is about I.T yes?
There's like 1000's of people on this site and Ponichan, surely could have got 10 people even if 99% of people could care less about sports
hihi Gilda
hehe and I'm having fun talking like Pinkie Pie hehe
Lok Tar Equestrians
this is amazing
Like I said
This show!
I enjoy sports
9Awesome, thanks. Now I have to think of a good one since you have Dash ; )

BTW GGgala, geekshed probably couldn't handle the number of viewers we'll be getting.

dat smile
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
inafter No objection jokes
lol
dat hair
well, she has a book on running
It's not set as public.
Maybe she borrowed it?
lol
Just like epic-chat doesn't appear on the list.
goth/death metal being gloomy?
11Yes it does
cant explain that
ah
You have to click the option to type in the server manually.
11What?
Also if you click on it I'm going to sing Pinkie's songs! ^^
11I can search for epic chat...
Hai guise.
Pinkie was right. Twilight does need to get out more.
but you think irc.ponyirc.com can?
she probably gave it to dash and AJ
A lot more
I will hold on...
Not where we're going.
Can AJ even read?
Jesus...
Where we're going doesn't exist yet. ;)
Even though I know of a person Twilight Sparkle would do a lot of company
um... probably..
ahh. heh.
Hello, Shamrock.
Nice try deducing it though. :P
Want to know with which person would Twilight Sparkle do a lot of company?
Razyn: Epic-chat isn't in the "connect" list.
now shes a lifeguard in Dubai XD
OH SHI-
Of course AJ can read. Can't exactly run a proper business without being literate.
okay?
You got a point there
/me points to self
11I'm looking at it under browse networks
oh, and she read a bedtime story to bloomberg
11And no bronystate
The person that Twilight Sparkle would do a lot of company would be Daniel Jackson from the SG 1 Team.
right?
You've met me Kodiak. . . o:
...
11But there is epic chat
Indeed, she did
6And Octavia is one too
Epic-chat isn't, I just checked.
6So far there's four that I know of including me
Octavia's cool, because I get to call her Škoda
Oh yeah
What's that Violet?
AJ just sucks at math.
why?
And we know the Apple family may be farmers, but they attend school like anypony else.
6Female bronies/pegasisses~
I have a feeling you are not paying attention.
IRL?
6jaja :3
Don't you use yer fancy mathematics ter muddy the issue!
oh, right.
Lucky you. I know none
...
Mails, I am unfamiliar with SG-1, so I don't really understand what you mean.
wat, ther are female broni- uh ponies?
11http://i.imgur.com/KOk5M.png
11If I scroll up, there's no bronystat
The SG1 is the protagonist team in the Stargate SG1 series
Although, she is actually probably good at math.
Daniel Jackson is the bookworm of the team
you mean bronyserv?
0?
Otherwise she couldn't really run an apple stand
I was actually saddened when none of my cousins recognized my Luna shirt
Wait wut...
6O: You have a Luna shirt?? <33
11Not there either
Did someone kick me out?
There's Easychat, Echo34, ECNet, EFNET, EpiKnet, Esper, euIRC, Europa-IRC, EuropeIRC, EuropNet, Evility, and ext3.
i'm pretty sure there's nothing AJ can't do
cool
That's everything in the list.
Yeah, made it myself
lolwat?
Thanks for reminding me ive been meaning to order a shirt
6I need to make one. . .
I don't think so, Triximancer.
Who wants a free cupcake?
6Dashite!!!!! <3
/me ponypounces Dahite
Don't need to be good at math to run an apple stand.
MFW you're looking at the wrong thing.
i'm on a diet
Augh! Got me again!@
She can't fly, LvS.
:P
11...
Ah I see that you answered on the cupcake.
well, she could. she just doesn't want to.
wait whats happening?
Can she shoot laser beams from her eyes?
I'm confused.
11Epic chat is there, you said it wasn't. I bronyserv is not above, in the B section. Just said that.
same
Personal Space Invaders, that's what
You're on the wrong thing, as I said.
Hi
Twilight can!
IRC isn't listed in their networks for connecting.
dat background
AJ can't NOT go to the next rodeo that comes to town.
And can beat the others in a race.
My Luna shirt: http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/9545/img1265h.jpg

That voice...
Twilight is so OP.
I don't think that there is a single pony that can beat Pinkamina Diane Pie when she activates her fourth wall powers
6Suddenly Sathi~
07no no it's not me
Being a unicorn who's talent is just "magic" is hax.
Remember she can do anything

From changing the scenery into becoming a Super Saiyan
friendship is not a competition
o-o
It's me ^^;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNEXJQkZpn0
07indeed
being in two places at once
Derpy could beat her by preemptively dropping an anvil on her head. :P
Just holy crap you sound like someone I know.
So how powerful are these lasers?
Whats next?
ah so I thought...
it's a livestream within a stream?!
CUTE
07dat giggle :)
Hey settle down now
um...
Twilight shrugs off blunt force trauma
what even is happening.
Suddenly, DODGE! *throws ki blast
Streamception
i have no idea...
11Okay. I'm not savvy with this whole thing. I just wanna bring Boombox in here. Is that too much to ask? How do I connect to this server on mibbit?
You're the Pinkiest Pie I know
amg
Only weakness: snakes
Powerful enough to leave the entire apple farm a smoking pile of rubble. :P
Why did it have to be snakes?
Let's hear some Pinkie Pie then...
Fluttershy could summon a horde of snakes and defeat her
Is she...
She is..
can't you do the same thing you did for Razyn?
Be very afraid Dashite
Sounds like whoever is trying to sing the song is horribly off
/server irc.bronyserv.co.cc is the command, though...
I told you, you need to type in the network manually for mibbit.
RPS with ponies.
As you have to for epic-chat.
What's going on?
Barry, lets hear you sing it.
/me giggles
The mic is prolly distorting somewhat
07A Lunar streamception
no thanks, I'm not a singer
11That will do then. Thanks anyway.
Stream within stream?
bronyserv probably isn't in mibbit's... IRC network search engine, or whatever... because it didn't exist till Sunday
07oui
Just click "server
"
what stream is this?
We must go deeper?
Stream within a stream within a stream, actually
It's because it's not set as a public server.
Chatception
Just as epic-chat isn't.
/me sneaks up and scares Cat
6Oui zat is correct madame~
Actually, a Stream within a stream within a stream, since she is watching Bronystate to
So it's not in the "connect" list.

The smartass's guide to gentlemanly conduct sez:
He's got 7 minutes and change to get here.
If a cadaver joins you for brunch, the proper course of action is to hold casual tea.
4We're giving you a trial run
XD
Puns.
why would a cadaver join me for brunch, though?
of corpse
6Six hours of talking. . .
mfw the bank rejects my payment for my pony shirt
Dear god.
6 hours, really?
okay, i'm missing something
InsertCupcake: lolwut
Zombies. You are the lunch.
ive spent over 300 pounds in the past 2 days tho
Damn
okay#
LvS: The smartass's guide to gentlemanly conduct tries not to judge people for the company they keep.
300?
does it merely try, or does it succeed?
300 pounds of what? (j/k) :p
All on ponies?
4What the trial run entails is that you'll be under surveillance from the other ops and you'll be tasked with seeking out rule breakers and the like in the chat
4However
I recently got my savings so ive been buying stuff
Well, it is a SMARTASS's guide.
Alone?
6FOREVER ALONE D:
maybe it tries to succeed
07Awwww
so the assumption is that it still silently judges you.
i got a helmet cos im getting a moped and a new ipod touch
RUN FOR THE HILLS
that's good enough, most of the time
InsertCupcake: where were your savings before?
in a savings account my nan and grandad set up when i was born
my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore :(
Watching your every move and silently judging you.
when i turn 18 i get access to it

Hm, not sure..

I don't even know
or rather "dschaadsching ju"
that'd be awesome

Look, master! I managed the dragon punch!
InsertCupcake: oo, neat. and late happy birthday
Gouken (master): Show Ryu, Ken!

4This doesn't mean you actually ARE a mod. You won't be given any commands to use. Your main task is to watch the chat, but be yourself too. DO NOT let on that you're watching for suspicious activity

Thats the one you are talking about

I know. You told me already and I recorded it. Just tell me when.
Now, I've read the rules for this place twice...
Ep 23, Cutie Mark Chronicles
i dont know who you are
There are rules?
I think its 23..
I wasn't aware that puns were kickable.
4And for that, we apologize for the inconvenience of how fast we went through the weeks
/me wanted to start studies in university but did not get in
*sadface
Yeah, it is
It's not trouble. I'm a patient man.
im sorry
well, she was improvising, i suppose
Cutie Mark Chronicles is good, i liked seeing pinkie's sisters ;P
/me hugs WhatPayne
I think it says in there somewhere that mods can kick you whenever they like.
07sorry for what?
Maybe it's one of those more universal laws
it's above IRC policy.
for being awesome^
/me hugs InsertCupcake back
If someone makes a pun that bad, you must punish them regardless of context.
They can pretty much kick you for whatever, since it doesn't really do any harm.
I can agree with that
Or something to that effect.
Banning is a different story
Hello
I got kicked yesterday for NOT linking something

07House is almost ready
i can't hear a word most of the time
I crave house
omnomnomnomnomn
I'm sorry D: ahhhhh
it's okay
13Now all we need is Herospirit
13Hmm
House or sleep... house or sleep... house or sleep. It's too hard!
Or they can banish you and lock you in a dungeon in the place they banished you to.
Why do I have to make this decision every day!
it's just middle of the night, have to keep my volume pretty low
Hey, I am trying to decide wether I should stick on my phone, or get my Mac while playing Fallout NV for SUPER MULTITASKING POWER
idgi
i don't get it?
07yes
Yes
07as in the tv show
tell herospirit to get their ass in here
Denied, I'm playing Borderlands right now...
Heh heh heh. That joke is almost as good for the IDGI reactions.
We do too
07~yay
but it's a difference in base-systems.
You're not a programmer I guess?
I should sleep in the rain.
hm, my stream seems to be behind...
Base-8 31 = Base-10 25.
Then I shall grab my Mac
me? no, i'm nothing.
/me 13has no way to contact Herospirit
Tons of rain outside.
Just a matter of time before everyone watches ponies
Nothing a quick refresh should not fix...
07We will see you Friday
Base-8 is Oct. Base-10 is Dec. you know, Decimal?
then house would be watching ponies instead of saving people
4Do you have anything else you wish to bring up, Razyn?
4Anything else you'd like to say?
They all have Lupus anyway
when that happens, I dont need a car anymore
ah. okay.
Season 2 will blow the Brony roof far into the moon
07Well Pinkie we are leaving you now
Octal and decimal.
07House is gonna air
the world will be taken over by bronies within 2 years time
How will I be reporting any shenanigans?
07thanks for the show!
im doubting it
my brony will fly me anywhere I want to ^^
No. Don't have to watch ponies /all of the time/.
31 in octal = 25 in decimal.
*shrugs*
Math nerd stuff
Bye Pinkie!
4You'll be letting us know in a separate room
13We have lost RDash =(
4We're gonna set it up for you
Yes you are.
Hey, there isn't anything wrong with nerd stuff!
4So if you see anything suspicious, alert it to us in that room
Boing!
We're in a room dedicated to pastel ponies.
Math Is Hard
lol i feel mean now, but i really couldn't hear much
Lets go shopping
Very well.
You know guys, even though I don't like ponyshipping, suddenly something in my insane mind hit me. Wanna hear it?
Hahaha
LOL.
i should have focused on math
What's that?
Hmmmmmm
I will be off now. See you Friday.
please.
Nice one, Triximancer. I remember that controversy.
Bit more obscure than the "there are 10 kinds of people in this world, those who understand binary and those who don't"
i dont
I could hear her fine
Ah, yes, Nashy.
That one is popular
What is your crazy pony ship?
We have lost RDash PinkiusPiacus =(
ShadTheCrazed: Sure, go ahead.
Some people argue that 10 in binary is not actually two
Something suddenly hit my mind saying "SPIKE X PINKIE PIE, SON. WRITE A FANFIC EVEN THOUGH YOU HATE PONYSHIPPING"
D: What? Oh no! But...
and to those people I respond "bløøøh i am slave to ASCII encoding"
seems underage
Dashie was going to be my cupcake... :C
Those people are wrong.
I LOVE THIS EPISODE!
Hi
4Well, that went well
._.
hi.
My computert broke
I like this one
07indeed
don't think i've seen this... weird
Which was a pain in the ass
07let's see if I can contact Synros too
Lol, Shad
And that is my crazy ponyship idea.
wait wait wait wait.....
Nashy: Not if it is a signed integer.
be your cupcake?
PinkiusPiacus: You've read the Cupcakes?
This is one very trippy episode
What? Did I say that? o-o
I don't really think too much about all the shipping, since none will ever be canon
*trollface*
Your mind literally called you son when it told you what ship to write?
To fix it, I had to turn it off. Hit it, swear at it, turn it on again, rinse rea[et
Who hasn't read it?
And, theyre ponies
>3> Yes I've read cupcakes hehe.
We have to come up with weirdest ship ever. I need the lulz.
ANd then suddenly I heard Pinkie Pie singing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
It's kind of limited how many ints you can represent with a 2-bit signed integer
How data is represented in memory doesn't affect how binary works.
But I still think it's a boring way for me to kill someone.
WHile SPike plays the piano in that.
And your opinion of it was?
i wanted to steal his stuff though.....
The ones who havent read it are the ones who still have some sanity left in them
SnailsXLuna?
I would rather make them into Gummy Food or eat them with my hair!
I haven't read Cupcakes yet.
Wander off and moan, remember I had a backup tower, swear, unplug my old tower, replace it, load it
snipsXsnailsXstoned trixie
...wtf?
Eh, you're not missing much
and redownload my IRC client
Keep forgetting to.
and I'm back
That's one like 100 pics on ponibooru
Or maybe the would absorb INTO me!
Because I love you guys
I rolled natural 20's in multitasking and dexterity
07damn
thank you
thank you for coming back
I've probably seen or read worse.
Nashy: Binary is still a symbolic system. The symbols mean what we decide that they mean, and there are multiple closed systems for interpretation.
I read the first half, but could not finish
So I just got my sega genesis in the mail... and it didn't work. Not pony related, but it's my news of the day.
Wait...hold up
Twitchy twitch a twitch
There's more to it? o-o
Maybe we should think outside of the box...
Quick, Sathi's having a fit!
My damn chat box failed
brb
4Go for it
RarityXThunderhooves?
6inb4 twitchy twitch
Dammit Denied, you don't roll 20's for stats!
Get House! :P
s
Humbug.
hi
Cupcakes isn't that good actually
3d6 loser!
Oh pony
ShadTheCrazed: Write it. Clearly this is inspiration.
Back
Luna: Katia?
There was another fic that shocked me more
If you have a Sega, go get Shining Force 2
ShadTheCrazed: This is a MUSE speaking to you.
So solo
Random shipping!
hummingway + elizabeak, please
So what did you think about it PinkiusPiacus?
I only read the part where I turned Dashie into a Cupcake. I mean it was well written but not very creative.
Spike x Pinkie Pie x Ursa Minor. BOOM!
Shad: Unfortunately, that muse happens to be totally batshit insane.
HI!
were you going to write a fanfic about Transvestie trixie?
hi.
Which one would that be Apokalipse?
Like I said, if I were to murder ponies I would prefer to do it in a more fun way like absorb them into my tail.
@Cupcakemeter
6 You are 23% Cupcake. (1527)
Because that'd be hilarious
07nope he's not on i'll e-mail him
Hey! The new guys!
I've got one trixiemancer... but it didn't work
I thought we were on season three. >_>
Solo: But I haaaaaate ponyshipping! ;-;
Lordlyhour: No, I wasn't.
=(
thank you
/me is sad
07omg
EMULATOR TIME
Hm
07your right!
ShadTheCrazed: Get over it? Obviously some part of your mind loves it.
07I derped!
nah, I've got emulators
@Kingmeter
boy oh boy, i turn 19 in 8 minutes
6 You are 29% King. (1528)
... Suddenly, I have the idea of this:
Sillyphilly
It's a fic which starts out nice with rainbow dash joining the wonderbolts and then out of nowhere at the middle of the story: This is now a clopfic
But this is such a good ep... >3>;
dat traffic cone
AJ/cockatrice?
cone
I mean, I got every sega game ever on a disc (obsidian) for my DC
happy bday
and PC
but real cartridge... that's how I role
happy birthday in 8 minutes
thank ye
0@kingmeter
6 You are 60% king. (1529)
lolwat?
I got a nice USB controller, I just play SNES games on my computer because my SNES controllers are all busted, even though the box works (sort of)
ha ha ha
is that me or the stream
that'd be more than enough time for pinkie to prepare a party
Someone is using VLC media player!
seen this
But we haven't been through the cop plot line yet.
4Sounds good, we can move this along real quick
I want the link Apokalipse. Lol
Does crossover shipping count? Cause I could come up with some REALLY weird ones if I can. XD
Pinkie Pie sudenly confesses to Boss Bronies (my band of 4 OC ponies) that she loves Spike, and she'll pay them to get Spike to love her back.
ShadTheCrazed: *sits you down on a comfortable couch, takes out a clipboard* How was your relationship with your mother? Clearly your hatred for ponyshipping is actually repressing your desperate need to ship ponies, and your mind is overcompensating with crack pairings. Like SpikexPinkie.
That's what I though... Wrong season
Dat product placement.
*bossa
I saw dat PSP.
No you dont it's just wasted potential, since it's a well written fic actually
*suddenly
XD
But then it just got ruined
Oh this is a fun episode too. I've seen all the episodes up to season 6. T
he looks like the alien abduction kid...
spikey pie. delicious
lol
Hi there ^_^
I like reading wasted potential.
Then once 6 started it kinda went downhill. D:
ShadTheCrazed: You clearly need to self-medicate by reading more ponyship fics.
hi
Fine, let me find it
Someone link Common Skies, stat!
Ok, Thanks =P
Don't want to rush things and make bad decisions though.
What fic?
No, I refuse to read or write more ponyship fics!
Scary_Scott. Not quite as creepy as Freaky Fred. :P
*10 DAYS LATER&
MORE!
4We don't but
4We really need mods
/me is giggiling like an idiot with posters of Spike and Pinkie pie
I read Past Sins and loved that fic. ^^
It's weird in the first place that Spike is even attracted to Rarity
Have we thought about Granny Smith X Ursa Major? =D
lmao
Unless it's just for the gems on her flank
And 28 days later, you kill everyone.
granny smith and mayor
4Crappy new theme song is INCREDIBLY crappy
Quality > quantity and all though.
what is this new ending
Hey anone here fic writers?
Um... the sound on this... o-o
Back again
...opening
where is mah Massive Attack
yeah teardrop is much better

Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
Needs shipping with dumb fabric

/me 4does not approve
Hmmm...
I'm thinking we should increase the spam filter up from 6:8 though.
4I completely agree
So yeah, I guess I can kick off my OC pony fanfic with them trying to get Spike to love Pinkie Pie.
Ship RarityxRock
4But we need to make compromises
FFFFFFUUUU
/me reluctantly raises his hoof.
Rarirock is second-best ship

I was thinking of an idea for a story, but I dont want to be the one to write it... Im not bad at writing, but none of the people I know in real life, not to mention the fans of my band should know I came up with it

Sketchy_Sounds: A Runescape bot. :s
Haha, she's holding my birthday. Also I am definitely not ready.
I'm willing to pay.
4But yeah, no matter how much preparation we have we can't tell for sure exactly how things are going to go until we stream the first ep
cupcakes
you could just use a different name
Oh. I can't host those, sorry.
Scott: Go to #EquestriaStudy and ask for a writefriend!
4Better be safe than sorry, y'know
ROcky walks in and comments on how nice the cave is. It's been fixed up to look just like a house
07indeed
07did you see Wrek's new banner pic?
07He finished Flutter today
I wonder if they're secretly working on a Season 3
4Nope
mode +q Polarfire
4I want to see it though

...
Triximancer: I wonder if they're secretly reading the fanfiction and giggling at us.
...I think they are working on season 2.
Doubt. Probably look at the reception of Season 2 before doing 3.
You know, I would not be surprised if this show goes on for several seasons.
I know they started on 2 in the middle of 1's run
Polarfire! <3
/me hugs RobotPinkie
DAT ATTICA!
Triximancer: OH GOD. I wonder if they're hiding in here under aliases and messing with us.
Polarfire <333
Again with the product placement.
infinite recursion, oh yeah
From my understanding Hub is losing a little cash
but....
Maybe on their other junk shows
I liked that one show before though. What was it called? 'The It Crowd'?
Triximancer: I wonder what kind of name they would use. Probably something simple, short and unassuming.
exactly, ponies is their star
yup
IT Crowd
What did I tell you about the universe RobotPinkie
plus hasbro always wants more merch
FYI Luna, what will you be showing now that the IT Crowd wraps up?
I bet MLP, Transformers are their successful ones
I think I shall find more episodes of that... O_O It was awesome.
so, I think it's safe for a few seasons
So, in theory
and how you should not break it!
Don't remember how long Sibsy said they had to finish per episode.
BAck. Okay guys, try to force me.
lol
How many people will be watching S2 Ep1 when it comes out?
no.
Shad: I already linked Common Skies.
I will
My understanding was their big draws were mlp, transformers, and believe it or not, family game night
That will be RIDICULOUSLY well watched
apparently fgn is super cheap to make
if only that wasn't accurate... that lady *shudder*
Like Triximancer
Poor kid. D:
Family Game Night...well, not too surprising, they are nice games and all.
PinkiusPiacus: Watch the entire show, four "seasons" thus far
I don't have TV here, or i would watch it
it's not broken, i'm just bending it a bit, InsertCupcake
I'm hoping it goes one for 4+ seasons. In all honesty, that's probably as much as we'll get before the people on the show get tired of it and want to move on to other projects.\
NEED NEW NAME!!!!!!!!!!
Solo: Link it again pl0x

A fifth season of IT crowd has been commisioned says wikipedia. Do want
Haha yeah House doing clinic duty is fun.

Besides, a fanfic can't force me.

Sketchy: I know that. I didn't realize Derpy couldn't describe EQ daily links
oh this lady again
New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: The Game of Princesses (http://tinyurl.com/3rfmsdv)
But y'know, I guess I'll write it anywhere when I have the time.
Oh dear.
*anyway
Game of Thrones parody?
This part.
Yes, but it's quite the question mark this fifth season
At least it gives me an idea.
"Of course it is."
haha
dumb monolith
She can't. As she says, she can only describe YouTube, Ponibooru, and e621 links.
I want a fifth season D=
Lawl.
Derpy be killing everybody out here. D=
Me too!
Sketchy: Yes. I read that this time, and I'll bear it in mind.
Besides the fact, I only support hetero ponyship.
What's e621
:|
Sketchy: Is somethin' bugging you?
hetero ponies?
what's that?
Big Mac pretty much
Uhm. No?
ShadTheCrazed: Discrimination! *Chew chew*

Eh.
Hehe.
Welp, I'm off to bed
I love these streams, it's always way more fun watching these with other crowd.
Whoa.

Catch ya later, everybrony!
And so...

Grab my tail, MrPoniator!
"other crowd" means all you
Scott: That's been done before.
Scary_Scott: Interesting idea
It has been done
Scott: Ah, missed your comment about it not being too original. Okay.
But I suggest you keep at it
Scott: So what's the hook for ponies?
Everythings been done :P
So guys, imagine Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy singing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
Scott: Pinkie x Pinkie hasn't been done yet.
Hehe
Bagels
I'll never eat them again
Hi Pinkius
I want to start a Brony club at my college. ^^
Rear smear
Scary_Scott: I would suggest that you go ahead and start writing it, and have a more experienced writer or too look over it and suggest improvements.
/me pokes Polarfire
too jazzy j-pop for ponies
:P
Up his rear and get a smear.
**or two, pardon me
think he connected and afk'd.
DEAD
ShadTheCrazed: Imagine pinkie pie singing it after telling Celestia she likes mmmmbananas.
did he died?
game. over.
Solo: lol
That was the Lupus showing itself
No. =W=; I think House only kills like 1 person per season.
Did I miss something?
Hello
hi
Hi
Ziltoid http://i.imgur.com/ra1Hv.jpg
I don't get the mmmmbananas reference
Well I origonally ment for it to be a series of stories to different alternate worlds, but I wanted to start with ponies, Its become my new favorite thing
look up friendship is magic bitch
or beeotch
or however it's spelled
lol James
Mason: It's a stupid youtube video where Celestia launches everyone to the moon with a cannon after asking if they like bananas.
seen it...
dASHIE.
lag
Dashite.
Mason: the voice acting is kinda funny. it's called Friendship is Magic Bitch
It is stupid but for some reason I laugh every time I watch it.
Derpy should be able to link it.
Did my image not show up again? :/
what kind of toys...? >w>
ah, no wonder
I like it
Sketchy: Yeah. It's that voice actor.
I like when celestia starts turning pink
!link friendship_is_magic_bitch
Twilight says she doesn't have anything in the library about that
that's funny as hell
Wut.
I'm not big on those kind of videos.
Derpy Y U NO
You know, I think one of my friends of actually a Brony by the looks of it.
Cruel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
Regardless of said friend being a girl, but what does that matter?
Yay! You must find out and rejoice
Ahhh the real world! It burns!
Even better
Or possibly closest Brony.
We can't all live in Equestria can we? D:
I'd like to
Oh wait! I already live there. ^^
If she's a girl, why is she in the closet? Girls have never had to hide love for ponies
Sketchy: The first thing that happened to me after I got in this chat for the first time, an op asked me if I liked bananas.
Hold that thought Cameron
Sketchy: I had a weird first day.
I hope in future we will get future politicians who are Bronies and they will make world better place
Well Colbert's already converted
I know, I was there.
And that's quite the step
This things claims i have mail
lol
I know you were. I was there.
Steward and Conan next
Lol
Sorry, Laughing from bannanas...
LOL
Yay!
That's when you say "I was that OP MWAHAHAHA! Do you like bananas?"
Heh @ Nashy.
Harsh.
I may well have been. =p
Anyway
I'm going to write things now
I'm a little hyper today because Louisiana finally cooled down after a record-breakingly hot summer.
And Louisiana is like a jungle as it is
/me resists the urge to scream that one bit from Welcome To the Jungle
And thus speculation begun
I know this is random, but I was watching the episodes through again, and I noticed this awesome colored pony at 15:41 and 42 on this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzplcDyF90U Any idea if she has a name that we know of?
Sketchy: You successfully used an attribute: Willpower/Restraint. +50 experience.
Atomic: (Without looking at the video) must be colgate.
lawl
colgate ftw!
actually, i cant look at links atm -.-
oh I fail
Actually... it IS Colgate.
btw it's the one on the left
!link big_macintosh
Holy wow.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/42143?search=wallpaper
I guessed it before I even looked at the video.
Link is dead to me for some reason.
If you're talking about the one with the multicolored hair, that's colgate.
The yellow pegasus with the raindrop cutie mark?
If you mean the one with the water-droplet cutie mark, no.
no way on the left
BLegh
yeah the one with the water droplet cutie mark
IRC derped out on me
One more.
When this episode aired people discussed whether House is autistic and thus can relate to the kid.
If she has a name, we don't know it.
!link big_macintosh
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/45582
meh
Most background ponies don't have names...
Nashy: not canon names, but fanon ones
they let the fandom come up with the names.
Make up a name
I'm not good with names, lol
Yeah pretty much
how many show references
13AFK for a bit
man
Well a lot of the names are bad.
Colgate, for one...
I dunno. Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, Cloudkicker...
Colgate is my least favorite fan name.
am I the only one that says Coltgate insted of Colgate?
simply because it's copywritten
:(
I love these references
Colgate is one of ther more imaginative.
No other reason.
Along with Dr Whooves
And don't forget Lyra and BonBon
I prefer them calling her Colgate over Romana.
So not all of them are that bad =p
or TARDIS, who came up with that one? an all caps name? terrible
Dr. Whooves is also a bad one.
lol Colgate
well she's a pegasus... and water droplets... something to do with rain maybe?
Hi everypony!
April Showers?
!link ponies
hello Colson
I dunno. Think about how each cutie mark is very symbolic
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/34674
Anyone want a hug?

like Cheerilee's cutie mark representing nurturing students
wanna hear a joke?
!hug

wtf

One of the fan names for the yellow pegasus with the raindrop cutie mark is actually Raindrops

Man, look at that page veiw counter jump...
Sketchy: I'm not doing your job. Your job is to moderate; you have authority to use on people. I was just asking as a fellow chatter.
i won't quit my day job
You weren't asking.
Asking is where you say "Could you please stop doing that?"
07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6823033/1/#new
Whereas you outright just said "Stop that."
Sketchy: I suppose if it bothers you that much, I'll try to be less abrasive.
See the difference?
and now you know, And knowing is half the battle...
Raindrops seems a bit lame
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36947
It does. Love and tolerance dude, it's possible to get people to stop doing daft things without being too in their face =)
I didn't think "Simmer down" was really that bad.
I suspect she is a pegasus in charge of storm clouds.
Considering her Cutie Mark
hmmm
awesome
Not all of us are very polite.
fits my love for weather well :P

Might be a colloquial thing. In my experience you tell someone to simmer down as a polite way to ask them to restrain their enthusiasm.
Uhm
Or even know how to be.
I had no problem with that part
It was the tone you used where you were essentially just saying "Stop that".
Rather than asking nicely.
07mobile me... ? I thought mobile me was gone?
Now to go eat and reluctantly go to my last class. Bye, all.
bye..
[15:15:41] <Solo> Colson: simmer down, you are spamming
^This is being politely informative
Not demanding he stop
Social skills, yay
Why does this never happen to me?
Just my two cents
How I love needing those...
dont ya meen Two Bits?
Anyhoo, back to minding my own business
You're not as awesome as House
I'm a little confused as to where you're picking up on that, Sketchy. But i'll be more careful.
Maybe I'm reading too much into it
And I don't go out that much.
/me shrugs
bits are like dollars, Scary_Scott
just my two centibits
Im learning so much.
House doesn't seem to do that either to be honest. xD
aww :(
Centibits. XD
(Nopony actually use centibits. Please no)
Sketchy: I can see why you got agitated a bit, in the general sense. I shouldn't be commenting on other people's chatting habits since I'm not a mod.
Well at least I'm not awesome. There's that.
wait...
So, uh
Sketchy: When Colson popped into the room and sorta went nuts, I guess I got the mental image of a little kid going Pinkie Pie crazy in the room.
There currency is in gold coin. I suspect that they don't really use monetary values below 1 Bit, and from what we see, there isn't really any tax.
Frogger?
:<
if you guys haven't seen it yet, SA made fun of us: http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/pound-puppy-bronies.php
eeyup
*Their
Haha
well, that's what sa does
awesome
'course they did.
Oh no.
I wonder if they just dig up piles of gold 1 foot below the ground
They make fun of everybody.
I don't go to SomethingAwful, so I don't care what they do.
so I don't mean to be offensive or anything...
And it's awesome.
but...
is this entire fandom mostly overweight guys
No
I am 137 lbs
That was posted earlier, and then it got taken down
um
Not overweight, no.
65 kgs here
People must have been mad
Mason_Trowel: Whoa.
I was in the equestria study room and I saw one guy with a unicorn hoodie
so not really overweight
Solo: No problem with you commenting on it actually, so long as they don't get the wrong impression.
and another one who was oerweight
Mason_TrowelHow tall are you?
5'6"
I am not just getting a good impression here.
Mason_Trowel: .....Whoa.
...what?
<.<
>.>
Mason_Trowel: You is small skinny man.
A wild troll appears
...I know. T_T
gotta go for now bronies D: But I will be on later for sure!
Mason _Trowel: What kinda mod does that give you to Escape Artist?
suddenly different game
game over man
but yeah...
bye PinkiusPiacus
Interesting story
He ate the sandbox
Hmm, I think the bonus for Halflings is +2
Going for now! Bye bye!
See you later PinkiusPiacus
is this higher concentration of weird people due to the fact I was in equestria study?
bye
DERP
However, I might only qualify as a Gnome, which I think is a +1
4Oh my
4A southern House
He accidently the whole sandbox.
On another site I'm on, there's an extremely autistic user named Trixie Buttercups
Not really, My_Little_Pootis
I wish season 2 would hurry up and come out...
shi-
Hmm. So I'm a whole foot taller than Mason, then.
4That's actually pretty...decent
I just don't know
this is so damn hilarious
EqD is PG rated
4for an Englishmen, after all
Daym House is awesome
Sketchy: Same. Tall people celebrate.
If you think you're gonna encounter the really weird ones, you're mistaken
4*Englishman
I need some sort of reassurance that most MLP fans are not like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw3DnhD8Gls&feature=related are something close to it
They usually stay in EqAD
ITZ NAH A TUMAH
Pootis, are you trollin' us?
New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: The Snowball Effect (Update Complete!) (http://tinyurl.com/64vg925)
I imagine furries probably go to EQAD
Guys! <3
Polarfire <3
Howdi
I need my eyes to see
What
sorry D: That's exactly what I did.
Not that everyone there is one, just that's where they can talk about their stuff
Howdy*
She routinely finds new boyfriends, which are in actuality, fictional characters
Not trolling.
My_Little_Pootis, we're talking totally normally, we're already at least 200% cooler than that video
BIG BAWWS
dawww... on the mlp wiki, she's raindrops
I have my doubts, that is all
meh
she Jelly
i smell a parasprite
at least you're on now :D
atomic: It's a wiki. you can fix it.
KILL IT
Well, that's understandable.
Every time she does so, she creates new blogs that are basically the same thing every time
Parasprite... Kill it with Fire!
My_Little_Pootis, I think that it would be wrong of you to assume that everyone is a creep just because of the eccentricities of the few.
somehow my client connected on its own this time... all I did was turn on the computer.
He's not doing her at all.
and yep :D
Am I the only one who dislikes the 20% cooler meme?
Pootis: This is a fandom filled with young-adult male professionals who are talented in almost every field of art. Think about it.
Well, alright then
Triximancer, I believe that EqAD is at least 50% furry, and since I see a bunch of the same people in here I'm willing to bet EqD is also significantly furry as well
...yet?!
20% cooler is 20% cooler than other memes
if you guys say so i'll give it the benefito f the doubt.
So, we theorized what would happen if she discovered FiM
finally caught a time when Dari, me and you are online at the same time
There's no information collected to draw statistical conclusions from.
kinky
mai waifu
Solo: it's not like it's incorrect though...
haha
and my bro
mai bro
<333
Xiagu: it heavily depends on how you define furry ;)
Oh, you're back. :D
atomic: yeah, but better naming can result in the character gaining mass appeal
also this...
/me isn't furry, doesn't like fanfics or sexy pony art
And here's what we came up with:
/me loves EQaD
so yeah
since there are about 50 billion different definitions of it
"HAY GAIIIIIIIIIIIIS!: I JUST DISCOVERED A NEW SHOW CALLED MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND I FOUND A NEW BOYFRIEND HIS NAME IS BIG MAC HES SO SEXY SORRY PHINEAS NONNY AND GUMBALL"
>just as I need to go >_> <_<
it is a variety
Colgate, I'm going off of people saying ``I'm a furry''
God, the messagespam
yay
noooooo.gif
and noooooooo
Or
D:
....
GreatNPowerfulPlanty: wat.
atomic7732: Not entirely incorrect, no. But the ones who are in any way similar to what Pootis was imagining are the minority in this fandom,.
Colgate, I only count the people who self-identify as furries
where ya goin Dari?
but it's only midnight!
victor was probably a long shot
That's...huh.
lolol
I don't go in there
Sketchy: I explained this earlier
It's scary
Okay. they warned us that they were talking about some crazy person. So i guess the all-caps spam isn't too much of a surprise.
ah, I'm undecided on that...
4Frankly my dear
I know you did
If you count people who don't identify themselves as furries
4I don't give a damn
You get silly
4I'm calling it
I think of the goat from Ed Edd n Eddy.
"I like Bugs Bunny cartoons!"
"MAI DISCOVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!: I JUST DISCOVERED A NEW SHOW CALLED MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC AND I FOUND A NEW BEST FRIEND AND HER NAME IS THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE SHE ROCKS AND I SHARE A NAME WITH HER SHES AWESOME AT EVERYTHING SHE DOES ALSO SHE IS SEXY SORRY PHINEAS NONNY GUMBALL AND BIG MAC"
Only got 4 hours for school yesterday, need trying to get at least 8 hours today.

It does not lessen my "wat"

Hey, I remember that goat
That also.

KILL your Caps Lock!
Dude, GNPP, could you please not spam us with all caps?
...Also could you cut down on the all caps
can we please stop the caps spam? :P
It's not a black-and-white division
".........you're completely missing the point of her character......... anyways, good for you"
ah.

i don't know what's going on.
I don't know what we're yelling about!

I've worked myself down to a 5 hour sleeping schedule :D
Eeyup.
SLINKY
nice :D
not sure if that's a good thing...
I don't ever know what is going on in this channel -.-
Well, I think GNPP's all caps scared away Pootis
lol
confound these 17-year olds, they drive house to...
No one does
Everypony is yelling and nopony is listening.
:P
After all that work to convince them we weren't weirdos.
always an open question.
what 17 year olds?
I've been going on 5-5.5 hours a night for about a week and a half now....
that girl was 17
everypony is a weirdo, true story
What?
Eh, we didn't work /that/ hard at it ¦¬]
we don't have to convince anyone.
ooooh cool
Yeah...I know
:P
lol yeah
Guys, remember that last part from asdfmove4? That moon part?
you like what? blasphemy!
*asdfmovie4
Ziltoid was right. ITZ NAH A TUMAH.
nope
I remember!
Anyone who would judge an entire fandom based on what is obviously an exception, is a weirdo.
We need to ponyify it.
ewww?
heh.

Damn you Jim!

been done already I think,
Luna getting kicked to the moon as a young filly.
If he's not on tonight... *sigh*
lolololol
I got some new guitar picks today
Solo: I wouldn't say weirdo
Well I suppose I can stay on to talk with you guys.
Too bad he wasn't here to reminisce with us yesterday.
4ASSSSSSSSSS BERGERS
After all, what do people think of furries as a whole?
I have a friends with Aspergers
Plorf: I'm saying wierdo instead of something more forceful.
Weird
friend*
I saw one where after she gets kicked to the moon she chills with Luna
That's mainstream
what about them? they are other people, /shrug
mild form of it anyway
I also talked to a local café about playing at their open mic night
:D
Sketchy: Do you prefer thick or thin picks?
no, if you need your sleep go ahead and go. <3
I don't consider mainstream to be weird
Sketchy: Cool. So you're going pro?
Mason_Trowel: Depends on what I'm playing. Generally I favour slightly thicker ones.
why would it even matter what some people somewhere at some point think of something?
CogWeaver.... that name sounds familiar
ಠ_ಠ
Quick obvious question... Do you think that ponies are a fad, or an everlasting meme?
/me nods
what time does school start?
?
No meme is everlasting
ponies are beyond a meme
Ask that again in three weeks.
Solo: I wouldn't say that exactly.
But ponies aren't a meme
I have Ponybergers
Then we'll know for sure.
Hans Aspergers had one unlucky surname.
Scary_Scott: Neither
It's a fandom
ponies are a lifestyle at this point!
severe case, I'm afraid
Scott: Who knows what the future holds? But I can say that this fandom is a symptom of a much larger movement.
Ponies will only last as long as the show + 6 months.
That's my theory.
It's a dedicated fandom
People still like old cartoons today, but yes once they stop making new episodes it will die down
I think ponies will be remembered fondly in the years to come, if that's what you mean.
It's just playing at a local café open mic night. Hardly anything big.
Nashy: i don't think so, I've met quite a few peopelt rhough ponies, and we will still communicate
8:20
ima go to bed now
"there are no sweeter words than this."
13Back
"nothing lasts forever."
I dunno. This is kind of a self-perpetuating fandom
DAAAWWWWWWWW
~nods~ I think that there will always be fans that cling to the show, long after its gone and long after its cool.
night night
it creates things off of other fan things.
13Also, what kind of joke is that MeteorVenture?
Sure people will still go back and watch it, but the community will sort of dissolve.
:D he gets to play frogger now!
If they canceled the show today, I'd probably stop coming here after a month or so
G'night InsertCupcake
lol
night
yay happy endings
night InsertCupcake
/me stuck here throughout the entire break between seasons
night
I have been pinged
Actually I should go to sleep too
/me has been here a long while as well.
night cupcakes
why was I pinged?
good night
Colgate: yeah, but you have things to look forward to. So that helps.
A break is different, there's going to be more content eventually
Because omi mentioned you, CogWeaver
In your face wilson!
somepony thought they recognized your name
Thanks for streaming Luna
Good night
/me hugs Luna
07your welcome
o..kay...?
odd
ah. well I guess its up to you...
Sorry about that
[23:31] <Omi> CogWeaver.... that name sounds familiar
Solo: nah, I just make my own content :D
not sure what those kinds of jokes are called actually
anyways, back to business
Wilson gets little knick knacks, House gets a PSP
I still stay up for next episode atleast
Hmm, I might still come here if other people still did.
thanks for Luna, streaming

It's fun to interact with everyone
Really, as long as people keep producing so much art, fanfiction and music for this show, I'll be here.
This is so unrealistic. PSP has no GMAES.
Same here pretty much
I'll still be here for a long time, or at least in EAD, because the community there is awesome :)
4Ummm, The_Si, that's wrong
cewl episode, thanks for tha stream ^^
If that stops, even if the show is still going, I'd drop the community, sure.
Well, I joined the fandom late, but thats cause when the show aird I was in a bad spot in life, by the time I found out about the show the last episode aird and I watched it all on youtube.
gnite :)
omg
No, no, no, it's PS3 that haz no gaemz
i watch this all the time
4I HAVE a PSP, and I have geams
and even if the show is cancelled, I would keep coming here.
A fan community is dependent upon the thing it's a fan of.
6I'M AWESOME! :DD
it's like "wanna hear a joke? environmentally friendly firewood"
And now, Im waiting for new season, and I never before waited for any shows second season with this much anticipation in my life
Yeah, I joined the brony fandom when they were all uploaded.
true, Nashy. But for all we know, impetuous bronies would start making fan episodes.
Watched them all.
Pony Diablo?
For how long?
Same here, Shad
basically whatever you name next is just a joke
Nashy: There is no accurate way to guess.
But you know, even if the show had a series finale, true bronies would still come here. Wanna know why?
I watched them all from start to finish in a single day
Nashy: there are old videogame fandoms that, due to sheer modding community, continue to this day.
eeyup...
See: Tribes, Deus Ex, Half Life
:3
ShadTheCrazed: because the people behind the text here are awesome? :D
Please don't start using the term "true" bronies. There is no such thing.
Making fan episodes is REALLY hard. Touhou has a really huge fanbase and they've only managed to ever make 2 decent episode-length fan animations
dari-bear
Colgate: Yes.]
Went from not-a-brony to brony within the span of the first 4 episodes or so.
NoTrueScotsman.
PSP has pretty awesome games... but i have no PSP
dari-bear?
Same, Mason_Trowel
Lol, Solo. NoTrueScotsman
Mason_Trowel: same here XD
^^
ep 7 is the one that hooked me
what?
<3
I considered myself a brony the moment Rainbow Dash said " ARE YOU A SPY?"
Everypony, I need your help. A friend is interested in the show, but I have no idea how to properly explain it to him.
So many of us are "Insta-brony: Just add pony" it is funny.
<3
Hahaha
<3
I was kinda lukewarm to the show until Sonic Rainboom
Episode One and two got me intrested, but Feeling Pinky Keen got me hooked
Pilot. Twilight Sparkle.
is that like a teddy bear but dari?
Party of One kinda sealed the deal with its Looney Tunes references.
show him some episodes, then?
I responded to those Accusations Plorf... with "Spah here" "Hey boys there's a spai!" "That spy is an ENEMY!"
And I watched the show in order
pinky keen wasnt out when i started ponies -.-
... yes :3
Ep 1 and 2 got me interested, but it was the following episodes that really got me liking it.
Could someone host something for me?
Same here, Sketchy
At the end of 31 days I pay 100-250 dollars
IIRC, I came into the fandom at about the halfway mark of Season 1.
I liked the pilot a lot actually
Around there
I can't remember how I got started, I think I just enjoyed it right from episode 1
Depends on how much the bot makes
Boast Busters is the best episode though
Everypony, I need your help. A friend is interested in the show, but I have no idea how to properly explain it to him.
4It's like a show
4But with Ponies
4Tell him that
lol
chocolates: sounds like a tojan to me :P
I came in just before Over the Barrel airred
4I dunno man
trojan*
I would probably say that I knew that I had succumbed 100% to bronydom with "Call of the Cutie". The moment Applebloom said "but I WANT IT NAOOOOO!" I knew there would never be any going back for me.
4FOOD
Any reason you can't just show him some eps?
4Oh, anyways
07Just let him watch an ep
07:)
Colgate: It's not a Trojan
It's a Runescape not
Bot
4Yeah, just show your friend an ep or two
l
lol
cute :3
I watch pilots and then get hooked or stop watching.
4Just do not pick Look Before You Sleep
Ahh. I watched all the shows in order EXCEPT call of the cutie.
still not going to run random executables from trangers over irc, that's just stupid
Oh, wait. Not Call of the Cutie.
I meant Cutie Mark Chronicles.
4That's the closest to a girly episode they had in the first season
And Twilight Sparkle was great in pilot.
My first time through the show, I couldn't find a good link of that one. So that was the very last episode I saw.
I loved Twilight in the pilot
And man, that was a way better finale.
"The ponies in this town are all CRAZY!"
It's easier if you already have habit of watching awful movies for lulz
Almost like an awesome epilogue to Season 1.
EVERYBODY DEAD
Twilight in the pilot struck me as being a huge bitch at the start, but by the end of it I'd really warmed up to her.
throat closing up shot no. 529
4I'm sorry, I simply cannot tolerate this new theme song
..without a bunch of crazy ponies *eyeroll* trying to make friends all the time.

well the first thing I ever saw was a kinda robot chicken thing with ponies
Nice to know that Google Chrome has a popup blocker. :D
I mean she's all "Pfft Spike we don't have time to be socaible, stp it"
Colgate: It's a .jar file you get from Rsbuddy.com. It is legit. You download it yourself.
She was something of a recluse, and I can really relate to that.
Oh thats just too awesome....i want a rainbow dash sweater
Ghosties, it's not a new theme song. it's a different channel's theme song
Better get used to it
So sorry about that
DAMMIT
lol
Fail!
And one of them has RD hair!
Ghosties, it's not a new theme song. it's a different channel's theme song
Skipsy: I note one of his friends has--what Solo said
So just tell him to watch an episode

On Fox, it's the original
You know what I want? A rainbow dash hoodie, a Princess Celestia Hoodie, an Apple Jack hoodie, or a Princess Luna hoodie.
lol yeah
that is a badass hoodie
Twilight is just asocial and has more important things to do.
chocolates: so... why don't you just run it yourself? -.-
And poor social skills.

(also, .jar files ARE executables, fyi)
eeyup.
So who is CrystalClear?
Huh.....MLP referenced in diablo III?
Totally Hawt
OH SHI-
4Then why change the theme song per channel?
secret pony level
different countries
Not anything so big as a secret pony level
copyright laws
It's just some little hidden references in the coding or something
and that's how Equestria was made
/me pops a coca-cola body and takes a sit

HAHA. Nashy. Nice to have your aquaintance ONCE AGAIN.
We need to try to get Equestria Daily up to 40 million pageviews before Season 2.
Wouldn't YOU like to know, dearie
Oh it's the random banana guy again.

I went camping
Mainly of the silver variety.

Who are the 2 regular active users here... And who are the 2 24h lurkers?
Huh...
Nashy: that would be a *lot* of page refreshes
Is that you in the suit?
Skipsy, where did you go camping?
....Skipsy. I think that's called "clubbing", not camping
Looks nice, I guess. Definitely colorful.
I really don't like this story arc
(now 3 I guess :P)
HAHAH
How would you know Omi?
I don't...
Umm...
Also I like how someone dyed their hair rainbow.
I just asked
oh gosh.. i have a horrible feeling that i'm about to get stuck on this game and go around searching for something that i just won't find
until hours later
But you made a good guess, someone stole my camera and took that picture.
Well probably Silvermane is a regular
lol you do realize he's written as the bad guy, Ghosties
TROLOLOLOLOLOL
07dat trolling
Yeah
Right
that's one.
...really? Odd.
no one tries to troll house
4Except, you know, House is an absolute ass
Well... it makes sense that it belongs to you or someone close to you
Sethisto just announced that Ponies in Socks is a dead meme.
4I'm fine with a troll trolling a troll
pow
Actor is good tho, I liked him as George Washington
/me knows CrystalClear's secret identity
>_>
Right in the kisser
I don't think it's dead yet lol
I'm not fine with someone kicking the cane of someone who can't walk

You know nothing sweetheart. :D
hoo ees eet?
Sure. But still, wastes site bandwidth.
LoL
But yeah, as in stolen, I left it on my table and another photographer started using it lol
What we need is ponies in socks in the actual show :P
are you a filly or a colt, anyway?
13RDash, you came back =o
Ha! I bet now that he has said that, he's inadverdantly revitalized the meme.
Whats this movie?
doesn't matter what they said to you or how much your feeling were hurt
4It's House, libraryaddict
Mason_Trowel: Perhaps that's his plan.
it's SilverMane XD
Well /obviously/ i'm a mare. Such a silly colt you are.
nah. that would only be a very temporary surge.
CrystalClear is, that is
depends on if connections every get established
Someponies think they can outsmart me. Maybe.....maybe....
4I think the cane trip is a bit too much, but I still think House needs to be put in his place sometimes
really? XD
What meme? Socks?
Yeah
people would try to keep it alive, but would still get tired of it again
Interesting how House is written as a prick and yet you still like him.
Ponies in Socks
GGgala needed a second alt to ship with Two-Bits
he was ShadowMane in #BronyState earlier today
I like to meet somepony that can't outsmart hugs.

Socks make me have to go potty.
So, BRB
This is me not being weird, with my camera. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_5001.jpg
Its really simple... dont touch me.]
Jikiro: You're Heavy Weapons Shy?
It'll get popular again if there winds up being a sock reference in Season 2
You was meant to be general, not just you.
I'm an Ass, but in an endearing way. A girl said so. Then she said she liked me.
4Ah
4OH SHIT
???
4DUEL DIAGNOSIS
4GO
05inb4 lupus
lol I do think he should be put in his place quite frequently
Skipsy: You look young.
well, it's way too late for me. good night, everyone.
You can still see the 20% cooler shirt. xD
4:O Double Lupus
Skipsy looks a lot like somebody I know
wait... whut
what did you think of that picture I posted? Its my new idea for a meme ^_^
^
but there's a difference between a guy who saves people's lives and someone who's just a troll
Everyone is going to ^%$# love her Sketchy
Solo, 1. I am done potty. 2, I am dissapoint.
I think I'll... wait outside...
>implying self-shipping fillyfoolery?
%Sketchy_Sounds Yep!
I'm 21, and I live in Alberta... so if you know anyone 21 in Alberta, maybe. lol
4its used to actually pot assassinations
Hurr :3
4*plot
You know what I'd like to see? A callback to the Gen1/2 leg warmers that were so popular to put on ponies because it was the 80s. And I mean a callback other than 80s Cheerilee.
>_>
And rainbow dash isnt the best pony. I didnt see her stopping Ursa Minor
Know what I'd like to see? SEASON 2
/me 11in crystal blue
InsaneNefariousBanana: I don't care.....?
if i inferred correctly...
4But House thinks he can get away with shit. Him being taught some humility or even being bested in a troll contest is fine by me every now and then
4wait, wrong channel
oh now you're just being obvious.
4In fact
I would like to see more Luna in season 2
4There was one particular patient that's an even bigger asshole than George Washington guy
Everyone want to see more Luna in Season 2
Scary_Scott: You'll get that.
Oh, hey. Sketchy.
4And I hate him
Solo, you're not even cool. Not unless you're one of the Synyster Gates solo's. Or Slash solo's. What kind of solo are you?
11Am not
>in crystal blue
4Because he's not an ass because he has to be
/me counts down the days until the 17th
щ(ﾟДﾟщ)
According to Sibsy, we'll be getting to see her, so I'm happy.
4He's an ass because he loves to be a complete dick
It's been confirmed by assorted staff that yes we will see more Luna in Season 2.
Sketchy: We came upw ith an amusing idea while rewatching Cutie Mark Chronicles.
yay
oh no, I'd be all for that, I just don't think this guy does it.
11>.>
Omi: We have Derpy doing that for us. Watch.
05lol'd
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:14h:07m:54s
HAN SOLO
11Has Shadow or Silver been by?
Luna and Grammy Smith will have an episode.
4We may have already seen it
*Granny
4But I'm not sure
Also Derpy comes to mind, but I would be currious to see what route they take with her name in the show
oh CC, u so silly.
DERP
I AM SPALLING MASTAR
11:D
Oh right, one more thing... camping isn't complete without a few ponies! http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2189.jpg
is there a fast forward button... for 10 days?
Wait...
11I am a silly filly
Is Derpy going to have a character?
libraryaddict: I didn't see Twilight doing a sonic rainboom and getting all of the main 6 their cutie marks for them.
You wouldn't happen to be /related/ to them both would you?
Yes
We don't know
Sketchy: Scootaloo commented that she had never even heard of a pony ziplining. So I asked who invented it in this universe then.
I heard that she was
i've probably missed that ep, then :P
hahaha @ Skipsy
CrystalClear is on comcast and mibbit. The only other person in here right now that uses comcast (that I can see) I Razyn. although his comcast is slightly different... >_>
Scootaloo said that Spike said it was awesome. So we concluded that in Equestria
dragons zipline.
/me knows CC's identity
I was on the Reddit answering, and he says she will have a larger role.
ZIPLINING DRAGONS. Scariest thing ever.
I think they'll probably be making her into Ditzy Doo. It wouldn't exactly be tactful to callher Derpy. Also, there are rumors, but nothin solid on whether or not she'll have larger parts.
Meaning an actual role to begin with
I totally have to use it in my next D&D campaign.
-_-
Dashite, CC is a sock, but not a sock foalish enough to be online at the same time >.>
baby drops ziplining, it's how they get around till they learn how to fly
Anyway
But I thought that the staff already calls her derpy
*dragons
lolol speakng of trolls trolling trolls :P
Why do you think that they will ever name Derpy on the show?
I'm going to go and write now.
11Oh GGgala, isn't it obvious? Silver has my eyes
11and I'm a sock?
4The bizarre, perhaps even sad thing, about that episode is that there were two other eps that could have been chosen to show and I bet in all three choices she was the one to earn the other five their cutie marks too
A friend of mine is drawing a spike ziplining picture :P
ah, you're Shadow's exwife then
I dunno why, I don't prefer Derpy.
11I did not realize I was a piece of lingerie
=/
3A sentient sock eh?
>_>
Skipsy, where the hell did you go camping?
I like Ditzy better
4apparently you are a sock then
/me 11is a sock.
I went camping in the mountains with a bunch of furries. XD
anyone want to unmask her?
Derpy is the name that they are using around the place. That's what they're referring her too.
4im not sure what you say to someone when that happens sooooo
It was... interesting.
I like Ditzy better, though.
4congratulations?
11Oh Polarfire, stop kidding around
:3
I think that whatever direction the show takes it, half of the writers of fan fics are gonna get upset about having to change from either ditzy to derpy or derpy to ditzy
A sock you say? http://www.fmylife.com/intimacy/761206
It doesn't matter.
what /is/ the deal between you and ShadowMane these days, anyway?
She is both
did he just?
11I better be something sexy, like some pink lace, not some old knee-high track socks
Derpy is her fan name, despite.
05he did
I think Wilson should troll House a lot more...
It seems to be common in fanfic to acknowledge Ditzy as her real name, and Derpy as a derogatory nickname
BananaNefarious... do you like mmmmm bananas?
4Oh shit
Ditzy Doo has already been named. They may do a shoutout about her fan name though, like Rainbow Dash saying something like, "That featherbrain is so Ditzy! She's more than that, she's like a DERPY or something." "Derpy?" "OR something!"
4I just noticed that the name list in the chat lights up when people talk
That's a good idea
05you didnt know+´
05?
Scary_Scott, you can suck on my big brwn muffin for all I care.\
4I did
Hey world
4But for the longest time we didn't have that function
hee.
~falls over laughing~
*heh.
11Well, we're... complicated.
Graham crackers/
This camp was awesome, it even had a full on outdoor rave. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2789.jpg
Lol, that's great, Kersha! XD
Ghosties, you've had it for weeks, months even
Ok I'm done with the pictures. >.>
4Not here
...how complicated.
I've always seen it since your 3rd or 4th movie night
Isn't it hot in the fursuit?
dumb typos
4I didn't see it at all, even right up to moving to the co.cc page
4Oh well, it's not a big deal either way
No response to my link? :(
11He plays hard to get
4I'm just glad to see it again
I like nachos.
I like pie
probably
The head is a little warm, but we were way up in the mountains, it was roughly 5C, so it was perfect weather for hot things like that.
Well, I feel pretty awake now. I'm probably going to go AFK and go work around the yard and train.
cakes and the fanmade sequel...
11Dashite, you shouldn't be using such expensive clothing, especially clothing intended for fillies, for your own, ehem, /use/
...
I don't like too much cheese, though, 'cause then the food gets messy.
If it gets too messy, then I have to clean it up.
And who likes to clean up?
:p
BOOOOOOOring.
/me does
not I
But if it's only a little messy, it's fine?
:<
11Oh Shadowmane... such a colts colt. He'll come back soon enough
I wonder how long untill this site has a billion hits on it,
The 4th wall. How does it work?
Takes <5 days to get a million.
Ponies, number crunching time!
ok, if we get about 5 hits every second...
~13 years according to my numbers.
OOH! I KNOW!
36 million!
EQ daily just hit 36 million.
I KNOW!!!
4>Evolution
4>Fictional
we must hit 40 mill before season 2 starts..
we must... we must. we must must must must
...
High chance of success
We musssssssssssst - BOOM!
4Does House not believe in EVolution?
Yeah... No
lol that's the joke
Luna, Y U SOCK NOW?
He should.
4He mentioned the Lochness Monster too
he was simply making a joke
My 4.6 days to a million has not rejusted for the next influx.
/me looks up
ANYWAY, I want to make some cake.
he's very sarcastic
4He mentioned two very opposite entities. One is regarded as myth, the other is regarded as truth
I will retime.
Calculationg, we are getting about... 432000 a day.
4wait what?
4Why would he mix like that
Why I sock now?
he's a jerk
4also Dashite, im never looking at a sock the same way again
lol
House doesn't have to explain shit
Socks are dead. Long live socks!
also mentioned global warming and UFOs, two equally varied things :P
I must have words with that teacher of yours, Miss Cheerilee....
lol
socks are luna's thing...
4So then, why?
Bedroom eyes sock
4Why must House fuck with me so????
I will time the counter to 100 hits and take it within 1.0 seconds
he likes to troll his audience
because you secretly love it
he just thinks you're that hot
~40.53 seconds, +- 1 second
432 days... at this rate and we will have a billion hits give or take
Hoo. (Channel stats page updated! View at: http://kamek.piiym-net.com/chromadancer )

You mean "you are" not "your"
"you do understand it's not really a puppy?"

Hi Ziltoid
11what are YOU talking about?
Something
:P
i am surprized he did not get caught for flooding in #staff
Scary_Scott, You lack grace and respect!
Heaven forbid I should have good grammar when writing.
WHAT are you talking about?
So between 432 days - 13 years for a billion hits
no ops around
/me covers her ears with her socked hooves to block out BananaNefarious' ramblings
Sketchy, you're being SUCH a ruffian!
4Sorry, I wasn't getting an alcoholic drink
4I don't drink alcohol
I'm grown up and cynical and I'm young :(
Luna, um... why are you in socks?
05*sips coffee* i concur
Banana, settle down, please.
........
You don't want to see Luna's mean side.
4well, i am talking about a video of two Mudkip that were high on some unknown drug debating various things over 10 hours, as one would say "Mud" the other would come back with "Kip" as would go on for hours
The real question, Banana, is "Why not?"
k
Sorry Banana... I was just havin a bit of fun, Dont be mad at me
/me nods, frowning. Despite the socks, she does have a mean side. She calls it "Sketchy."
hey Wrek
Okay, I rejusted for 437.5 days. Yeah.
05ohai
/me strums a guitar
11Sweety, I think you need to cut back on the special grass. I know what it's like, I was a party mare in my younger years, but that sounds like you are overdoing it
~Decaps got youtube on the brain.
Sketchy, if you don't calm YOURSELF, I'm going to kick your flank until... well, whatever! You get my point! Shoo! Come back with an amount if elegance! By the way, your mane looks uglier than Ditzy Doo's mental health.
~Youtube on the brain~
4nah, that was from a week without sleep
05yay for necrosis
~His mind is turning to mush, think he'll go insane?~
Well, I'll go play some Pokemon B/W, I guess.
4and around 100 red bulls
i love necrosis
my fetish
05though im still guessing lupus
4im already there DE
I wish I'd brought my textbook with me.
I should do math.
4actually i take that back
NOW. Time too waddle in the corner muttering about how ponies are taking over my life and helping me break out of sanity.
I've got some reading to do and I don't feel like heading to my dorm for all of half an hour before I head back.
Wow.
xD
4you will know that i went insane when i say pop is good music
Chest to pubic bone huh.
Kersha: I should, too.
I really wish I never have to get a surgery, hory shit
I've got some proofs to do for Real Analysis.
So, any of you not told anyone that you have a love for these ponies because of what they might say to you?
That is pretty insane. Pop is a drink, not music.
I also have to print out thiese proposal forms ;-; Working sucks
4pop music
Cause I havnt told anyone in my life other than my mom, and she now thinks that Im a creep.
And Luna, you look ugly in those socks!
Luna?
Oh god
I'M GONNA FLEE FOR MY LIFE
oh, and gee
BYE
hello
hi
...
Sibling love, that's hawt

oh shit
what the hay was that about
Oh.
I have not a clue
Twincest is best incest
4anyways, i said what i was talking about CC, now what were you talking about?
Ugh. What a bucking crazy day.
It's harder to talk at school about ponies because of my friend going CRAZY about ponies.
mum*
It's pretty easy to tell whether something's convincing or not.
4Mom, mum whatevs
... doesn't sound that hard lol
hell I wish I had someone to talk about ponies with, at least There this chat
Especially when you know what his English accent sounds like.
She spends all class talking about them, at her club mettings, and tried to tell the teacher to call me Fluttershy (even though I am CLEARLY a Twilight Sparkle)
It hard to talk about ponies at my school because the only possible brony there isn't even in any of my classes.
I just wish I had some muffins. Speaking of which, lidueirvub
I had blueberry mufins today
SHe is making Poines despiseable because she's being annoying
Well, Imma head out.
u jelly
KershaFangs, do you like toenails?
Wouldn't be surprised.
See you all later and nice talkin to ya
*muffins

I enjoy having toenails
/me if he hadn't eatten earlier he might have been hungry
11I was talking about how my Shadowmane is just being difficult. He'll come back to me and we'll be a family again. Maybe if Silver would let his grudge go, Shadow would relax
4http://miburl.com/z7Rh1j have some nightmare fuel
/me pops open another coca-cola
So, Kersha. Would you mind farting on a goblin for me? It's make my day. Well, mine and Professer Oak's, too be exact.
Game of Princesses is hilarity
But where would I find a goblin at this hour?
Easy.
4http://miburl.com/EO1XmB and some more, this one is HILARIOUS though
4That would be...well, pretty humiliating
Foreman is all for incest
That's actually exactly what he's saying, lol
All you got to do is take a gram of marijuana
/me glances back at this window
fart on it
/me raps Sanity_Is_Not_Immemant on the head with a socked hoof.
Why was I pin--oh, nothing important.
I say no to the wacky tobaccy

/me wishes he wasn't behind in this storyline
4thats just a funny picture
4i know how you feel DE
11What story line?
4i have a storyboard to do for a 3D animation and gaming class
lolwut
4>most
4But not me :(
4story where someone tips me over AND I SMASH UP EVERYTHING
3*Headdesk*
11I'm just hear to check on my little Silver. Shadow dropped off a file...
If you grew up in a family that didn't speak much english, then no...
The parade scene physically hurt.
4sir you must need a new desk, as yours must have a head shaped dent in it by now
If you're not British you most likely won't have heard his English accent and be able to recognise where he slips and lets it through when he's speaking.
4I'm gonna save some face by just not exacerbating this extremely awkward situation
What, there are accents in english?
I never knew
People assume things are slips when they aren't, though
House isn't a new yorker

There we go
MFW BRONY THEME SONG
Love this song
/me dances
/me joins in
Ok RP
or well, not out of principle, but when they can't hide their accent
NO-ONE TALKING! HERE'S MY CHANCE!
You got a problem with dumpsters?
As long as they keep from saying "eh" and remember to say "about" instead of "aboot", we can't tell.
PONIES!
05abewt
poni is spread, good day
Eh.
ABOOTABOOTABOOT
Ding ding ding ling liiing
it's more like "aboat" really
Never heard anypony even SAY aboot.
since a different discussion is happening in the study...
ive been writing some original fiction
ive already got an established universe and several stories
I bet snails will
would crossing it over with ponies be considered using ocs?
Unless they were mocking the stereotype.
Hmm, probably, if your work isn't published yet.
Eh.
how do you canadians say "pony"?
05poony
Pony.
oh wow :O
Like I said before, I plan on doing something wierd to kick off my fan fic.
>mfw the fires around here are making national news.
A band called Bossa Bronies comes along to preform, mane six go, stuff happens, now this is the odd part:
That's English. I don't know what the french word for Pony is
i used to wonder what friendship was all aboot, eh?
lol
4http://miburl.com/eFTP3w
oh you, RobotPinkie
The french word for pony is pony.
http://miburl.com/eFTP3w
Pinkie Pie confesses to one of the band members of Bossa Bronies she loves Spike, and she'll pay them if they help convince Spike to love her back.
are you sure?
so you're still carrying a torch for the guy, huh, Crystal?
05stay up and watch house, or go to beed and actually be able to work tomorrow
... WHY>
05hmm, nah. House it is.
07^^
07last ep ;)
Why? It shot through my head.
Yeah, those are some fires
i haven't been awake through all of this, lol
Why does she love Spike?
05ooh
I didn't want it to, but I couldn't refuse after days.
05this episode
(MFW i come back to so much chat)
05shit
4is it http://miburl.com/J2sTzE ?
11Oh if you've seen him... *shiver* so handsome, with that voice...
They took pictures of them from space... D:
Of the same thought popping up in my head.
And the best part is I am smack in the middle of them.
Pega, you missed a letter
fuu
You need more mental discipline.
Pony is Poney in French
near Dallas?
you forgot the E
And why? Well, reason why I'm using Pinkie is because she preformed "We Gotta Share" with Spike.
The worst ones are in east texas.
I might not even do that, I HOPE.
What if the same thought popping up is something terrible...?
ooh.
It is terrible, but wierd and insane.
*weird
Sorry.That's how i pronounce it.
YFW this episode is about a fireman who broke his back
What if you get the idea to hurt yourself or others D:
And like me, I am weird and insane.
I believe it's pronounced Ponay
Nashy: Naaaah.
And it keeps coming back?
/me hides a chainsaw
[00:18] <AllisZero> What, there are accents in english?
[00:18] <AllisZero> I never knew
4ill just take that as a no....
Are you serious?
Everyone everywhere has some kind of accent.
No, not really
lol
In every language.
ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH PONAY TO SAVE THE PRIME MINISTER,EH?
Yeah, when you told me about the fires yesterday that kept you I checked the news like whoa.
11is what Love?
Time to head to non-denominational service
They definitely sounded headline-worthy
I often get this strange idea like "what if I stab myself in the eye" when holding small pointy objects.
lolol Pegacorn
Doesn't mean I do it.
JAIL
There's a very extreme range of English accents.
But luckily, only that part of The Chronicles of Bossa Bronies will be that odd.
Stick a cupcake in there
I do NOT have an accent. Only foreigners, southerners, easterners, westerners, and northerners have accents
4you'll figure out what i meant in time
I know Dari, I know...
You have an accent.
and... the other fillies?
A thumb up for the Bad Dudes joke that i made.
I guarrantee it.
I read that as "Client Excited"
ACCENT
Instead of having an end to the fanfic, there will be multiple chronicles.
I have my fire escape if anything goes wrong... *looks at bedroom window*
I don't speak Japanese but I can totally differentiate between accents from the north and the south
Well sleep time.
I have a texan accent
Like AJ
I can copy any voice i want.SUPER POWER FTW.
But not so obvious

I went out to my car this morning to go to school and it was covered in ash.

Well, one of my characters just surprised me by having herself a motto / chant I didn't know she had.
GUESSS WHOOOOOO
And I looked out the window and thought it was foggy. Dude. It was /smoke/.
That is some Silent Hill shit right there
I don't have any accents. Only other people have those
^this morning
Well ill be doing my homework in here..
I have no accent, because I'm Swedish.

New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Irreplaceable (Update part 17) (http://tinyurl.com/5teg5ue)
If i was an 8th grader i wouldnt of wanted to watch MLP
Hahha
Louisianian is a word, by the way
Gotta love that smile on his face
niehter would have I
overzealous security guards.
05i see
11Well I should say so.
4im so fucking confused
meh its naptime
I was not man enough
it's recognized by Mibbit's dictionary
STOP!
Hammertime.
Mighteh respectabal,but ah'll show ya how it's dun.
so im writing some original fiction
3At least you didn't come in at the halfway point Decap
^
CAN'T TOUCH DIS
I'm on the 2nd floor, yeah.
^
lol AJ
there we go
They didn't like me, I think.
4MAKE OUT
it involves swords called Rapinoccisors
4YOU'RE ALONE
But if our house catches on fire I'm headed out the window. :P
Can't touch dis
11Oh for the love of the Northern Light...
Now, Hammer dies!
4DO STUFF
HAMMER DIES
And I think AJ has more of a Geogian accent, than a Texan
Georgian*
heh :P
11I am Silvermane's mother. I know, I know, hard to believe it, I took care of myself, but he has my eyes.
there's no escape like a fire escape
Yes, I came back! Although it looks like I missed you by 45 minutes :(
4im still confused
Well, I'm an 8th grader, and I do watch MLP:FiM
05i find it hilariosu when i join a group of people
/me accidentally logged out and didnt realize it
derp
Nothing special.
4more than when i saw pulp fiction when i was 5
05assumes*
11Shadowmane is his father
....
that guy
07not a smart move..
Rarity has what sounds like a posh accent, when compared to the Oranges
Oh man, again?
Nice. Make anyone watch it?
i heard this place might live stream the season two episode one video as it airs?
Sadly, no. They all seem to refuse.
will it?
If I join voice chat people wonder if I'm people
He has his mother's eyes alright. What'd he get from his sire, would you say?
Like as if nothing happened.
There's no right move with this guy, really...
That's the plan
07that is correct
4ill just say ok
Absolutley nothing.
I did but no ones a brony yet.
yes threedraw
But what happens if Live chat fails on Thursday's live broadcast
i made a friend watch it if i watched claymore
live stream*
Rarity is fail in my opinion.
But they know and most tolerate it.
4how do you know what his eyes look like?
Then the world as we know it ends.
lol
MFW dari is still lurking >_>
My area- no, mainly all of Tennessee seems to be so far back in time, it's like as if I came from the future.
How can youb tell?
*you
/me lurks
11oh... just about everything else. Well, everything that is reasonable for his mother to know about anyways... I'll have to talk to his fillyfriend, Martha something to find out if he's like Shadow in any /other/ ways
well here in cali people are more open and stuff
>_>
So...that means...
i know these things.
Then those who don't have Hub will have to find alternate means of watching the episodes, like Youtube, or Hub.com
I love you Dari.
<3
Any octavia fans willing to lend a hoof?
Shad...we have to send you...Back to the Future!
:P
i wish there was an mlp/claymore crossover
3Ah...that is an exceedingly strait answer.
Or... Brony State
Shad, you so little~
number of times they've destroyed the MRI machine...... is about to go up, I belive
you know
My friends like adventure time..
if that fails, then yes, once they are available for download
I need an album cover for all the MLP songs I have on my MP3 player.
i saw priscilla as soon as he saw celestia by the way
it might as well be a secret
11DecapKing, how WOULDN'T I know what Silvermane's eyes look like?
and Bronystate streams them like they do everything else
Rofl
WE BOTH SAW CREATURES WITH A HORN AND WINGS~
4i was talking to GG
I love you too. <3
or not...
can't wait for the 19th to find out if this girl that I like actually watches the show or not
11oh
Yeah, I'm 13.
hehe!
Ah-heh... of course, CC...
Should i watch Adventure Time?
she looks like she would be into ponies
YOU SO LWITTLE~
/me is saving money for a plane ticket
And there are pictures, Decap.
eeyup, mrmoomoo
I so leetle.~
05hi Flutteryay
Leetle tiny baby man.
Heheh.
11Well, Shadow was always an adventurous colt...
ive been expanding my experiences by saying ill watch x if my friend watches fim
3Why would you have pic~nevermind
I just wanna put you in my back pocket and feed you Skittles, you so little~
>baby man
Or I guess I could save money and swim.
My brother and friends also like Adventure Time.
>fox news baby man report
thereby expanding my horizons and adding more to the herd
Hahaha
oh okay....
Oh god
That way I would have enough left over to buy you some lunch.
yay
Another MRI machine
Lilfut
NO.
oh man
11I think he may mean that Silver has posted portraits in her before
That's pretty good.
CrystalClear: eh?
Yet, despite my best efforts, they don't like FiM
You wouldn't have the right currency.
So there.
!moon
adventurous?
I'll convert it on my way in.
yeah I was wondering about that
Lilfut, convert some Jehova's Witnesses while you're at it.
so ive started watching adventure time, wwe, and claymore because of friends
Grab my tail, CLOPFICS_ARE_TASTY!
I dont understand Adventure Time
hahahano
I just wanna try to make an entire announcement of Bronies. That is the only way how I can get peoples' attention.
4wait are you talking about real life?
With plane ticket money, I could buy you a BIG lunch :D
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:13h:19m:13s
i wear a brony shirt to find out if others are bronies
hey, save some for the dowry, there
Is season 2 this weekend?
Moomoo, you don't GET Adventure Time, you just enjoy it. They get more of plot and explain more things later on in the show.
11You are an odd one, DecapKing
Season 2 begins in 10d:13h:19m:13s
Lilfut: I want to make a Brony shirt.
Next weekend
i will soon enter that dark place known only as hot topic to obtain rainbow dash tshirts
Omi: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
i bought one at comicon
Did you just come from the dentist, DK?
11GGgala, the stories I could tell you would make your mother blush from here.
Lilfut: That's how I made freinds at school
*friends
I wore pony shirts :>
3Decap after dentist. xD
/me is saving for our island too.
I wanna try to make a Pony shirt
Fever causes prostitutes!
wearing my cave story hat helps also
3 0_o
I draw pictures.
seems legit
Maybe I should get a black shirt, but RBD's cutie mark on it.
OSHI-
You have a cave story hat?
in making friends
*put
I ENVY YOU
4I was but now im
/me needs a purple shirt.
Work from there.

AH MADE IT MAHSELF
;-;
I WANT ONE SO BADLY
I don't know how to make clothing
Do you have pictures?
taped some white paper on a red hat and wrote "curly brace" on the hat
ART
Ohlol
not yet
He looks like Peach from Blade.
im working on a full costume
Costume is easy
Oh?
i have all but the weird headphone wing things
Do you think a cloud shooting down a thunder of red, blue, and yellow is feminine, by any chance?
I've got a black v-neck
I've got red skinny pants
Neat-o
i have all that
4i was just looking for an excuse to link that song
except the wings
Wings?
11OH MY EARS
Lolwut?
on his head
Oh those
3*Headdesk*
headphones?
antennae?
Make it monochromatic in red and it's manly even
I want to try to make a costume based on the CMC costume.
3*Deskbreaks*
I thought they were headphones/antennae
3Shit...
11Oh dear, I hope Silver isn't listening to such crude music now.
its up for interpretation
BLADE
i also have the green scarf
4DE might i interest you in a new desk?
and a polestar
he looks like Tom Hanks, I think
Nice
11He used to listen to Perfect Pitch's orchestra all day, as a foal
Red silk everywhere, and red cloth with the CMC costume logo on it on my arms.
3Naw, I have backup desks
(its a blue nerf gun with a star on it)
Fuuu
/me 11trots in. Blue as the sky.
That's how my costume's gonna look like.
hopefully
I JUST REALIZED WE ARE ON A PONY CHANNEL TALKING ABOUT FAAASHION
heh. I have to head over to a friends house to work on a school project, but I'm bringing my computer so I'll just be off for a bit.
Well, this won't get confusing at all.
WHEEEEEEEEEE
/me covers her ears with her hooves to block out Lilfut's shouting
11...

3*CutsSelf*
She's a good Mailpony and bot

3OH FUCK THAT IS SHARP
Yep
11WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME
4sounds like fun DE
IDEA

Ziltoid: my line
13Nope.avi
3Broken desk shards are painful :(
hope you can multi-task while you're there :D
4so are bullets
anyway, how do i made antenna
Why am I liking G1?
6Correct me if I'm wrong, but that looks like a fat suit to me. . .
щ(ﾟДﾟщ)
3Also, your probably going to be murdered Razyn
probably not very well... but atleast I'll be on.
11(Chat me is OOC, just so you know; that's not Razyn)
Um
I hope he has a router :P
take old headphones and put pipe cleaners on them
11*shrugpony*
3:P
Like, those fuzzy sticks from craft stores
EPIC FAT SUIT
XD
i might just do it with all pipe cleaners
/me 11taps her hoof, furious
>implying some people don't have routers
i am twelve years old and what is this
2Perhaps... But it was worth iiiiiit.
Or paint some wire green
Or juts get some green wire
"Well, I just might try to grab a black shirt, and print out a thundercloud on it. Maybe a thundercloud shooting out red, blue, and yellow lightning?" -Something I posted on facebook.
twirl them around and over my ears and have them stick out the back
2And Truuuuuuuuuuue
HEY I LIVE IN BOCA RATON

NOW I'LL SEE WHO'S A BRONY! MUAHAHAHAHAH!
4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJQU22Ttpwc
3(There were no parentheses, therefore it's canon)
I think he just has a desktop.
Or..
You could ask people
I could just steal his internet.... :P
"Are you a brony?"
If I just do that, they'd give me a wierd look, I bet.
lawlz. sounds like a plan
4thats the type of music that Silver listens to i think
3Go peddle your music in the main channel DecapKing!
yeah it's most definitely a fat suit... i recognize the voice
And when I explain to them or if they find out, I'd get an even wierder look.
4nah this isnt my music
not that those two observations have any real relation, lolz
4im just putting that up for shock value
Must.. Restrain.. Self.. Season 2.. so.. close..
anyway. See you guys in a minute <3
3Yeah...I can tell.
see you soon <3
11o.O
I can't ebleiev I have to wait this week and ANOTHER week for s2. ;-;
4i get bored sometimes
11Silver always HATED rap...
Pony party viewing party!
I thought it was this weekend! Now I have nothing to look forward to THIS weekend!
*believe
3Razyn, you'd better make up an excuse before Crystal eats you or something...
4yeah i know, so do
MFW it requires logging in to YouTube to watch
4i
Fuckin' horse-apples
This weekend you can look forward to only another week until poines!
And then i was inseen.
2I dunno what you're...
*unseen

2You guys know Razyn?
I can't brain today,i have the dumb.
6Oh I see you Pegacorn~ ;3

2We got the same name!
4FU AND YOUR DARK BLUE TEXT!
3*Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headesk*
OHGOD
/me runs away
In my school there is only one other brony out of 2000 people, and I only heard about him. I don't know his name, I must find this man!
Why would it be?
oh yeah
HUZZAH
3X3 combo!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
Razyn? From The Adventures of Razyn & Razyn?
Twilight told me this video is about Bayonetta - Fly Me To The Moon (Climax)
DAMN MY UNEXISTANT POWERS!
OHMYCELESTIAANDLUNAYES
Beautiful song~
2I'm just visiting Equestria, seeing how things are around here.
Yay Bayonetta.
/me 4facebrick
3C-c-c-c-COMBOBREAKER
Puh puh puh puh PEGACORN!!!!!
2And technically, there are /three/ Razyns
?
Oh look, a pegacorn >_>
If I cannot finish my Calc homework after one episode of BronyVille I never will be able to do it.
I still can see Trixie doing Bayonetta's gun shoe thing, but thats becuase trixie is cool.
I wanna sing with Bayonetta, but alas, she's fictional.
05suddenlty the freakzoid theme plays in my head, featuring pegacorn
11I certainly hope Silver doesn't spend all his time around you... ruffians. If this Marth filly isn't up to snuff, I may have to drag Silver home again. Not that I wouldn't mind doing that, haven't seen him in so long
>: D
2Who the hell's Silvermane?
3Chat level up! +4 to insanity, +7 to non sequitur
Would it be too much to encourage someone to portray any of the ponies in Bayonetta clothing?
4dont worry, im not too bad of an influence on anypony
In fact, I'd love to sing Fluttershy's So Many Wonders.
4Holy mother of god
One video by myself, one with Fluttershy.
eh?
2I don't even hang around this joint. :\
13Lol
Taxi? More like the dump truck
/me slowly unsocking Luna

She'd have to wear 4.
but that'd still work anyway
Hmm, that name sounds familiar <_<
3(*Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headdesk* *Headde~ect.)
Yes it would
/me runs through glass

I want jetpack shoes.
Where oh where could I have heard it before >_>
GIGA DRILLU BREAKAH
Or wings.
Or we can have Rarity do it. Either works for me
2Dood, why do you have a desk with you?
That wouldn' rip off my shit.
4we get the message DE, you have a metal skull plate
*shirt
LOL
3(*BloodlossKO*
Expect Trixie to be running around in high heels
Cannot be..

Who thought Cameron would be House's successor
and then when she needs epic power to kill giant Ursas
4cause DE isnt always that right in the head
Sketchy_Sounds|Writing: I can see that!
XD
i lold
2You ponies are weird
Her clothes would come off
2And that's saying something
05i call translation error on that one. however I do hope for the best
and said clothes would form giant things to kill the Ursas
2Considering who I live with.
well.. wow
4and dont worry, he'll be fine, he is only bleeding from a gash in his head
Why do people always kill Scootaloo at the end of Scootabuse fics? :(
Wait... you're not the Razyn who lives in the dorms, are you?
`BlacklightShining: Freeze ended up with a motto I didn't even know she had.
Who knows?
really?
what is it?
Hopefully
2How should I know where he lives?
Eh
13Lol
"Cool as ice, soft as snow, tough as a glacier: and that's how I roll!"
4im the DecapKing that lives out on the streets
Dieng is better than going hrough more of it.
13"Tentacle Horses"
secret pony level
13Ive seen enough anime to know where this is going
11(Your Razyn lives in Baltimare, but he travels so much, that's not saying much)
Also Scootaloo is a proffesional orphan
hehe
:D
Boom
I'm writing a crossover fanfic with Fist of the North Star and MLP
DannySwish: ^:Sk_tchy_Sounds|Writing
0_o
im writing my own story.
Make that one more fic that kills off Scootaloo
RainbowDashCancel: You are already my very best friend.
idk what anime you've been watching
about a random character made up :p
11I'm going to just sit over here and wait. Hopefully this Marth filly will show up before Silver, although I'd love to see my little colt.
(that's a pointer to the last thing Sk_tchy_Sounds|Writing said)
Would that be considered Clopfiction?
Or just hentai?
http://img.booru.org/furry//images/91/17bec12eb10b7ddcfc0b6cb6034501136ffed00e.png
lol =3
13Yeah

You haven't heard of ShadowMane will be around again, have you?
I'll admit though, I laughed

I like that image too
Back from tea time.

4well, you might if you see two raisins, but there are two Razyns here
13But thats the one

11Everypony, meet Razyn, the... Well he's a pony right now, but he's usually human.
11yes I am, GGgala
I'm watching it on Steam right now as we speak.
4You're here for the interview to become a mod. Do you have any questions before we start?
4i've met someone called ShadowMane a while ago
you should watch death note.. imo it's really really great
What is it about?
3.......THE PLOTHOLE THICKENS
So you guys think I should?
/me 2flutters his stiff wings

13Thats all the characters she has voiced
It's awesome because it is

4also DE, you just ate a rock.....
hi every pony
I believe it was when I saw the very first movie night topic on ponychan. Long time ago
2Now that's funny.
I think Applejack would make a better Kenshiro analogue personally
3*COUGH* *HACK* *CHOKE*
4yes it is
You'ld think TS would have gotten powerful magic, and AJ or RD would be the phyiscal buff
/me 3spits out the rock.
/me meows at Luna and then falls asleep
11Mmm...hmm... I'm going to go sit over here... in this cafe... in public view... where it's safer

So, who wants their soul stolen by fluttershy's stare?
3Mmmmm....vodka.
the girl's name is Rin
On weekdays I'm open to help when I get out of class. That's usually 3 or a little while afterwords. After that, I'm good all night.
Rin yes
4get your own!
And hmm
10lol pegacron, they didn't /go/ anywhere, they just stopped going to certain places I guess?
OH GOSH THE HAMPSTERS
man that was adorable
On weekends, it depends on my work, which can be sporadic
3*Sigh*
I cast Rainbow Dash as Rei because of the color
FUCK THIS GUY
10idk certain people just flit from place to place from time to time :)
lol well i was intrigued enough to watch it
draw friend is up
2That shit's nasty. You drink that?
Pinkie Pie would make an awesome... dammit I've forgotten Ken's rival's name.

No no
Twi is unusually cute.

Yes, him.

Ohmygosh, that FlutterMac drawfriend pic is so ADORABLE.
don't think I seen derpy post it yet
2Pfft
hello all
10nice link there
Although Pinkie Pie being insane is horribly cliché by now.
3Highway robbery.
which image format supports layers?
/me 2doesn't need money to get some
2Oooooooooooooooh
I would totally make Twilight Julia though. Well maybe.
drop the . at the end
/me 3pulls out a silver flask.
4what can i say? its in my blood
I cast Rarity as Shin
OHMYGOSH!
DesertRose: PSD?
It's Lady Amalthia!
that flutter mac picture, makes me wonder what the age difference is between bigmac and fluttershy
Last Unicorn FTW!
Not alot
why does http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AcFjfrPRaCA/TmapceZjIGI/AAAAAAAALrs/BMbJoJzl7Rw/s1600/trixy_kissu_by_kloudmutt-d490p7n.png remind me of Freya from FF IX
3You're hilarious Razyn.
Fluttershy is probably close age wise to him
ty
/me 3takes a swig from the flask, then tucks it away.
makes me wonder why big mac shrunk so much
2Ah lighten up. I'm just messin withca'll.
I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing.
BTW should i see the twixie link...
lolwut
07magic!
4Razyn if you had any money you would probably spend it on hookers
I guess Rarity would probably be a better Juda, considering personality similarities
there sure is a lot of references in this drawfriend
He didn't shrink. It's clearly YoungMac and YoungFluttershy
*different references
It's not that NSFW
You can tell cuz Fluttershy is gangly.
There's far more implied than shown.
2Pony hookers...?
2What?
3Oh god...pony hookers...*Shiver*
...
4Do you have any experience with moderating?
10XD
10that was just
2...Do they have those?
05haha
10well that was just House.
WTF?
/me 3takes another swig to drain the thought from his head.
4well you see so many in Stalliongrad you just get used to the thought
05CrystalClear perhaps its the hair?
I am....bored o.o
quite likely. the art is quite beautiful
2Egh russian ponies. :\
05indeed
2Meh
Trixie is indeed tied for 3rd best pony
Yay, 3 hour class of boring.
Sorry guys,my internet dun derped.
4like you pegasi arent any better
However, I have the almighty wall socket!
What class?
15ohai GGGala
3I take offense at that good sir!
3I am a great pegasi!
05I cant rate ponies like that for some reason

Anthropology of Humour, much less entertaining then it sounds.
Not in IRC. I've moderated at several forums in the past, usually as a favor for internet friends, etc. I know well enough what to do and how to handle it, though admittedly I will need to be taught things like op commands
/me 2isn't even a natural born pegasus
ugg u think i might be sick....
/me 2so he don't give a shit
4wtf is that even possible?
3Yeah, you're a natural born human, ya dick.
i think*
4I see. What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
blah o.o
2What's wrong with humans, eh?
4In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
Well i gotta finish my econ HW.
4As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
3Too much to list.
4those /things/ are disgusting!
hmmmmeh
I can, because Dash is obviously best pony.
/me 3takes another swig from his silver flask.
2Pfft. You ponies are crazy
05<3
Dash=Best pony.
ohai Razyn_the_Pony
NOPE
2I bet there are some bad ponies out there
!flip
/me flips a muffin
I need to shave my face is itchy ><
/me catches the muffin with her hoof, correct side up
/me 15waves
4yeah, one of them is right next to me
Fluttershy is best pony
:P
BOYS,THAT PYRO'S A SPY
6Rainbow Pony is best pony~
hmm remindes me i need to shave allso lol
2I don't count, numbskull
Ziltoid is quite correct
is this the real life
Let it grow keyframe, it will stop itching.
NOPE.
4other side
is this just fantasy
2My mistake
Rancid is caught in a landslide.
EEYUP
no escape from reality
>set Ziltoid's hostname as Dash.Is.Best.Pony
>win
But... I look so much cooler with a goatee
3Surely you don't mean me?
WUT
7HAMTARO IS THE SHIT BRO
I have a pretty ridiculous work ethic. I don't like leaving things undone, and I don't really care to see things done wrong. But that doesn't make me a team player; my job, as well as my current pathway through college emphasize working as a team to get things done, and I enjoy it. I'd more or less be on call to help out whenever I am on without any qualms.
Open your eyes.
13Lol
rofl i have a goatee allso
13AFK for a bit, gotta take my shower
4trust me, the things you do when you get hammered are enough to even shock Princess Molestia
It's awesome no?
3.......
Look up to the skies.
2Ho! I wanna hear about this.
yes
In summary, I work hard, but work hard to get along with people in the proccess
Ziltoid's server is rainbow-dash.bronyserv.co.cc
lol
/me 3splashes some vodka into DecapKing's eyes!
I didn't yet.
I was just saying I should.
4As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
:P
4sorry, can't tell you
I drew a picutre of me as a pony, with the goatee and my awesome hat some people call me Movie Hooves
/me 2leans back
my server is fluttershy.bronyserv.co.cc
/me 3leaves in a huff.
oh what, like the time he beat up his own dad? that hardly counts.
lolno
4Disregard that last post
4What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
/me glomps Tavy
i grew it out once dident look good lol
No, set his hostname.
3I was in my right mind then!
Not what server he's on,
4nah stuff that you weren't there for
/me hugs Sketchy
3He deserved what he got the bastard
13Aww, no welcomes. lol
I know, but that is still his server
^
was gonna say
2Oh fighting.
07Welcome Octa! <3
OCTAVIA!?!? THE MUSICIAN?
2Meh
oh hey octavia
Lol House
4yeah, that guy was a wanker
13lol Now... :P
13Heyyas. lol
Guys,is it normal that i always pick Nick when i play L4D2?I know that it's off topic,but i just have to know!
no, he was a fucker
that was the problem
I let myself go while I was in Nebraska
Facial hair wise...
Other than that I got 'guns' now
Hahaha
Steak is good
13And yeah, the musician CrystalClear :P
2What'd he rape someone?
3*BeginsCrying* THE BASTARD RAPED MY MOTHER
*fan squeel*
MeteorVenture XD hamtaro
13lol <3
/me flexes into a mirror. "Looking good Keyframe. Lookin reeeeal good."
guns as in arms or the kind that shoot bullets
4thinking he was better than everypony else because he was an alicorn
2Hm. Well, rape aint' funny.
*cuchie Cuchie* (or whatever they said)
LAWL
/me 3takes another swig from his flask.
Oh if Silver had told me you were here, I'd have come MUCh sooner
Pythons maybe?
lol
10Mfw he gets a 'internal game battery has run dry' error
13I just got in. :P
so many star wars refrences
lol ya that's always awesome
6Hallo Octavia~~ <3
I NEED ANWSERS
Fucking internal game battery died on my blue.
3Then, he-he...he tried to convince me she abandoned me...
13What was that Dashie? Thats right, im not gone yet..
13Lol
13Hello VV :P
/me 3sits back down.
Blue didn't have an internal game battery...
/me 13slowly backs into the dark corner
15There there.
10sux bro. My 5th Silver cartridge is dead too
15It's okay
It did.
For the save files I think.
Something like that.
But yeah, it died.
if it saves it had a battery
10CrystalClear dari is right :P
Nick's thoughts on internal game battery deaths:DUMB SHIT
NEIN
Brony movie night is pretty heavily marketed in several places. Viewership is sure to increase at a good rate, but I think that it would gain even more leverage with more community features such as a dedicated forum, which I'd love to help take care of just as much as I would the chat. It would give everyone a better idea of who they are talking to
4i should of killed him right there, using my bare hooves
:O
I AM INFALLIBLE
10it didn't have in-game clock events though
*: D
So close to finishing the first section of my Fanfic... It'll be a first... Is this what it's like to be a crazy fan?
JA
Alicorns, man. Think they're entitled to rape everybody.
No.
3The worst part was, he actually believed he was telling the truth...
2Gods are dicks
4GG, not cool man
at least, more than the fast-moving chat would. I think Movie Night has a unique community, and it can really only go up with more interaction within itself
You only go crazy if it's a clopfic.
the berry growth was base on an internal clock though
CLOPPER
/me nods
I have Lauren's autograph. I framed the restraining order.
3But I knew she was the element of loyalty, as am I...she would never...COULD never do such a thing...
i think it was every 2 weeks or something
4I see...any other ideas you may have?
Keyframe: LOL
you can still play just the berries wont grow
lol
I will quote that line
/me 3sips from his flask, once again.
haha
ridicirus
/me 4starts crying lightly
well every pony i gotta go bye might be back latter
Just for the record I am not a stalker
By the way, you're out of milk.
Later
/me slaps DecapKing around a bit with a large trout
/me hugs Octavia
...I had some this morning.
Pull yourself together man!
4im going to get those fucking alicorns back for everything they did
2How're you the element of Loyalty?
Off the top of my head, no.
Did you finish it?

No
4Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?

there's this machine that's defaulting to single-user mode…
TEAM CREDIT IS TO HOUSE
/me 3pours a little of Decap's vodka into the flask, then hands the bottle back.

Hey Solo, what's up?

That's what I call it

3Don't like to think she was entirely against it....that he hurt her too much...
Hung out with peeps from IRC in Synchtube (hit the sauce)
I'm pretty sure she's a lesbian. Denied's father couldn't bear her rejection.

Mainly, I would love to help out on most any brony-born site that I can. This one, I think, gives me a good opportunity to actually help out among the show's community, which is something I find appealing, as my other two choices of communities I visit, the Equestria Daily and Ponychan, aren't exactly feasible
Do some homework!
Testing something.
(hit the sauce)
Sweeny Pie
I am! You dont have to yell...
Talked about philosophy and the underlying social movements underpinning the brony community
Ah, ok

Pinkie pie handed me a cupcake, said it was a secret recipie. what you think i'm stupid? i read the fanfic. I THREW IT ON THE GROOOOUUND
This chat is awesome because we're all doing hw AND talking about ponies at the same time

Xiagu is such a perv.

hes the one who asked Sibsy how Lauren Faust smelled >.<

Welcome Back!
I have to approve it
Naughty.
fair enough
/me hugs Luna <3
did sibsy respond? XD
I remember.
Screw that use meters per second.

No one in physics uses miles.
Always the answer
Xiagu...maybe you should hang out in EqAD.

Luna in socks!
Accomplice.
meters per second squared?
Ah, I guessed as much
/me hugs Self_In_Socks

dat discrepancy with the the phrase 'mean to you'

It was a pretty tame joke, too.

/me steals the hoof and runs away with it

It takes an adult mind to really get a joke like that.

It has a faintly ridiculous working title which is probably going to end up being its actual title
dammit chase

/me 4takes a swig of vodka from the bottle
Ok.
4So you're relatively 'new' at IRC, is that correct?

That image is not really explicit, though it is obviously beginning to border on it. I would likely keep an eye on them, and warn them if they begin to get excessive
it makes it look like your doing something though
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:12h:28m:56s

You better not let Occy hear you say that, Sketchy.

Outright warn them, with more heavy handed measures taken if they do it again

Dino Spimony
/me re-engages lurk mode for reals this time
from someone else
It doesn't work when YOU do it, silly Tbuddy7
*Spumony
11(you just realized that by the infinite-universe theory, Equestria really exists)
Keyframe test
If you mean the character from Hey Arnold
:P
and it pings
/me 3already knew this.
4(I knew that)
ha
*Tbuddy*
(you just realized that what you said is very silly)
did it work?
Yes
That's harmless fluff. No action, unless it starts an argument in the chat or something
:D
6Goodnight Dari~ :3
Uh oh
2Here's how my transportation thingy works: some eggheads at the lab activate it, and choose a world. Then, they choose a 'branch' of that world, a fan made version of it. I go to one of the different versions. I have fun. The end. Goodnight. Buh-bye.
/me nomnoms muffin
11(knowing and realizing are two different things
4And final image
I think my chat is going derpy...
Imagine if MLP came out during the year of 2000
I want a muffin too. :(
4http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/131154337367png.jpg
Wait, no...
Keyframe: i have the LG opitmus V if it means anything but the widget is free on the marketplace
Technically it came out in 1983
o.o
It just gets a little wonky when someone uses an emote.
3(Did you know that the best way to get to another universe would be to die in this one?)
/me wonders what Ganon's up to
first time here what happens here?
I'm eating Lemon Muffin in real life
imagine if MLP was traditionally animated
/me wants another muffin.
/me 11cuts her throat
lemons smell nice
!muffinkiss
/me regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Luna_In_Socks, showing her most adorable kissing face
05house
Yea found it on the market. They should get an app for the EqD countdown.
07Welcome
05and ponies
imagine MLP irl
We watch shows and chat.
traditionally animated MLP? years between the seasons...
:O
10cya dari
4i knew something was wrong with her
Also hi.
/me kissyfaces back and accepts the muffin
05welcome to our corner
You don't wonder that, RainbowDashCancel, cause you don't THINK!
I think that deserves a kick
Keyframe yes they should lol
I'll take flash animation ty =D
2Well shit, son.
glorious 4DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
with a ban if it repeats itself
^lol
In the year 2000...
11didn't work
/me nomnoms muffin
I'm learning flash
/me stretches
random shows or are there regulars(not including ponies
Tbuddy7, how many MFLOPS do you get
Ah, Nin10DOH! reference.
looks like it's more ShadowMane to go arou--
2Nice prop
Makes me appreciate Maya 2011 more
in the year 2000 that would be newgrounds quality
07I like his answers
Xiagu MFLOPS?
oh, she's back.
MFLOPS?
Some of both.
3(Then our brain's energy waves, which dissipate when we die, can reach faster-than-light speed and jump throughout the 9th dimension into another universe)
Depends on the streamer midor
whoah, how do you do that bold thing
PFLOPS!
What are MFLOPS?
/me stares a second at the muffin, is kind of hungry again but decides to fight the urge to eat more
11what was that about Shadowmane?
but flash can't hold a CANDLE
A CANDLE
mflops bro
4Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
to traditional animation
Razyn Y U USE HARD TO READ DARK BLUE?
4Do you have anything to add?
sometimes
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Maybe.
yeah but traditional animation takes too long
actually, a lot of the time
we've accepted worse
House, It Croud, Dr who are all commmn.
:P
Yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps MrMooMoo
but it's nice on mlp
4I actually believe he owes me
Oh, nothing....
nice
johnny test, on the other hand...
do you really want to take 10 years betqeen the seasons?
2BECAUSE I LIKE BLUE, AND THE MILF IS USING MY HAIR COLOR SO-
Remake Code Monkeys with the Mane Cast, Mayor Mare can be LArrity
3-Back to IC-
07indeed but his application was a bit meh
Millions of floating points operations per seconds, Tbuddy7 and FluffyWuffs and Mason_Trowel
/me chews on some muffins and some cupcakes.
07he did well
mein gott!!
point*
:p
I'll be back in a bit just gonna finish an episode of the it crowd
I look forward to working with the mod staff if I am accepted, and if not, I will likely hang around the stream more often regardless. Thank you for considering me.
05now i know for sure i missed something
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/53621
Xiagu where do i find out on my phone?
implying it took ten years to animate young justice or samurai jack or whatevuhs
Twilight told me this picture is about plushie derpy_hooves plush real_life Lawnmower
4We will discuss your interview with the rest of the team.
I mean i'd love to see don bluth ponies but it would take too long
Shouldn't that be abbreviated MOFPOPS, then?
07it will be on the forums shortly
Derpy with a lawnmower seems frightening.
4What do you guys think?
o_O
yeah, i ain't disputing that stuff
All right
but imagine the sheer BEAUTY
2IC?
and GRANDEUR
4Please remain in this room
i'm beginning to crush hard on the Shadowbolts, they so coo'
Night Dari
(in-character?)
3(In character)
Tbuddy7, install linpack for android and run the benchmark and tell us
It would be nice to find rigged 3D models of the MLP cast
13Ehhh...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_HWaTaUVns&feature=related
(ninja'd)
K, cya in a bit, Midor
13I missed some of it
The show's music was amazing
I should probably look >>
Mason_Trowel words like of, and, the arent abbreviated
2Who, you?
3(HIIIIIYAAAAA)
Gmod
13I get this feeling from him though.
I love listening to MLP's background music.
I'm watching Yu Yu Hakusho
Gmod is in a game isn't it?
rainbow dash bgm in video
sandbox yes
dat chat
DELICIOUS
dat irc
its a Game within a Game
3(*sigh* As in within the boundaries of what the character we are RPing knows and can do.)
Oh, I knew that. :P I am wondering where the "L" comes from, though.
dat... mIRC?
yea no I'm talking like Autodesk stuff
dat leitmotif
10mfw text
what they said
3(AKA, Not breaking the 4th
HK IK handles and stuff
3)
I love the sound of a lawnmower running over a flipflop
Hi RainBroDash
13I'll have to take a look at the whole interview on the forums.
10hey barry
4We decide now
Rainbow Dash's background was pretty epic :D
t-flipflops? what did that circuitry ever do to you!
4We're pressed for time
/me 3slaps Razyn. Stop staring at the woman!
Hello Octavia
Yay for Octavia.
Howdy, Octavia.
3Snap out of it!
13I can't make an honest decision since I missed some of it.
http://youtu.be/1VV2qHzGKfU I love this one.
2It's in my nature...
4anyways if you wanted cuteness, this group of colts wouldn't be the place to find it
07Octa it's on the forums
o hai Octav
Hello, MrEvergreen, Mason_Trowel, and yay for Lysiria. Hello, FluffyWuffs
hihi Octavia
07I posted it 10 seconds flat ago
2Yeah.
Someone wanted cuteness?
Yes, Miss Octavia?
Wrong Mr..
6I believe he did alright. . . He seems dedicated and, though he has a lack of ideas, I'm going to vote ~yay~.
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
Oh, it's you.
Xiagu 7.473
11(are they all staring at me?)
oh man
4apparently Razyn did
2Truth be told, I was checking up on My Little Mutant over here.
sad face
You need new Cello?
13I don't recognize his name...
/me 2snuggles Razyn
You're popular. I imagine your computer is going ping crazy. XD
wheres the one BGM where Pinkie pie discovers that her friends don't want to be her friends anymore
/me is sad now.
2Derp
yousa say he gonna die?
4Most of you won't
I think it's a yes
/me meant to say hello, MrMooMoo, though MrEvergreen is also fine :)
Wait whut?
13Oooh, Ghosties friend...
It's a 6ft tall violin! We established this!
07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6824588/1/#new
/me has it on mute.
Lawl
/me 3stares at CrystalClear.
yes jar jar
oh is this ghosties' friend?
/me is happy now
Lol
/me 2snuggles Razyn_The_Pony
Sorry about that, MrMooMoo. ^^;
4Yes
!mail Octavia new TAB key
07oui
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
4He is my friend
lol violin cello or bass?
15...
13This was one of the apps I didn't feel too good on...
Xiagu why do you ask?
/me 4also stares at CrystalClear
Bass please.
Self-cest
Octavia: Who is your favorite composer?
/me 11poofs her mane
Tbuddy7, because I have an intercept and I was thinking of upgrading
Thats not the first time that happend.
/me 2stares extra hard at CrystalClear
I'm gonna be honest I didn't like the app either
/me 2EXTRA HARD
WildPlastic, all time, classical, modern, or ...?
Xiagu it have a crap ton of useless apps too im not sure if that affects it
/me 3continues to stare at CrystalClear, slightly amused.
Oh hey that's John laraquet. Or how ever you spell it.
4I felt iffy about suggesting him in the first place because I didn't want to seem like I was forcing him on the team. But he honestly did want to apply when I brought it up to him that we were looking for mods
13I'm reading over the interview real quick.
haha
rereading the interview now
/me stares at the stallions staring at something, confused.
6I was not on the application, but his interview was better. . .
/me 4keeps on staring at CrystalClear with a slight smirk on his face
danny elfman! lulz
dat hivemind
/me 11poses for her sudden attention. 'At least they have taste'
13lol
Xiagu i got the virgin mobile plan for 35 bucks a month 300 inutes and unlimited text and data, the phone was 150
I had no idea how epic the MLP theme song was without the lyrics. o.O
2You wanna fuck?
/me stares at CrystalClear because everybody is doing it.
think it's time to log out of ffxi for the day
/me 2smirks
/me 3glances at Razyn, then facehoofs.
Lemon_Lime: link?
/me 11can't hear any of you as she is in a cafe across the way
I really like Marty O'Donnell, too.
I have returned.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2RMy5z43w&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL Here ya go
15...I think some ponies are staring at you miss.
/me 3motions to CrystalClear.
hey guys what's going on in here
/me looks back at everyone else.
4DE, is it me or is she posing?
/me 11cocks her head, curious at the gesture
Inception, MW2, Dark Night..
13I just feel like we're giving him more... leniency since he's a friend of Ghosties I guess.
4And that's what I don't want
WildPlastic, as a sweeping answer, i would say handel, weiss, strozzi
Did he do any other videogames?
/me 3points his hoof at Razyn. Then points his hoof at Crystal.
No.
I dunno. They seem to be watching someone.
Solo, welcome back
/me is still reading
6One thing I noticed is that, he didn't seem *too* interested in dropping in beforehand. " I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing."
that was byootiful
4When Hipster advocated for Cross, Hipster pushed and pushed and pushed for Cross to make it on the team
/me is also reading
/me follows the colts' transfixed gazes.
What about Jeremy Soule?
Octacia: You're the real deal!
Ooh, yeah...
You're also missing a big one, MrMooMoo
Whoa, I'm listening to the theme where the 6 Mares met NightMare Moon.
*Otavia
Pirates of the Caribbean
hello
That cafe... their sandwiches look delicious...
/me 11looks at Razyn, then down at herself, confusion apparent
/me 3then uses his two hoofs to mimic the act o~OH GOD...
Lol
And of course several others
4I don't want to seem like Hipster
6We know you're not trying to do that dearie :3
/me 2thrusts on his hindlegs toward CrystalClear
Sounds like something from Star Wars o.O
I know. I was there yesterday. :)
thanks, Octavia. how's it going?
I wonder if hes doing MW3
/me 3facehoofs.
07Yea cross got in a bit forced, however Wrek is a friend of mine
4god those two are thick....
Solo, I am back to work, 11 hours ahead of me.
07he followed the normal process
I wouldn't know.
/me 11blushes furiously and looks away, suddenly very interested in her sandwich
Marty alos did the halo sondtracks.
13Hmm... I really wasn't fond of his application, but his interview was better...
Octavia: ....Ouch
4I admit that I would be particularly happy if he was accepted for a trial run
BLegh, my chat is going wonky again.
They as great as they look, Dashite? :D
The best part of MW2 was the music IMO.
brb
13Feel like I'm one of the few who didn't have my foot in the door somehow. lol
/me 3whispers to DecapKing and Dashite, "I don't think cuteness is ALL he came here for."
/me 2giggles. "Works everytime."
Gotta. Finish. Econ HW..
4But I'm not going to go the Hipster route and automatically assume he's going to be great
Worth every bit.
Night Dari. I think I'm a bit too late though :/
2I'm always *up* for some fun.
/me 3whispers, "Keyword: Came"
05*thud*
/me 2flutters his wings
11 hours that sucks
dumb ethernet cable...
Hey, everyone!
13Little derp on the images, but... you can learn that stuff, I think at least.
dumb fabric
Okay done with homework,
4yeah, im not supprised about it either
Stupid rock!
Watching house, I see.
Oh hey Wrek, nice change on the tail.
4We had to teach you
Hey Jen!
gta4 or tf2
Dumb rock, silly.
4although im glad i came to hang out with you guys today
A rock?!
13Well, I'm used to a more... lax atmosphere.
My destiny is a rock?!
07I say yes for a trial - run
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9VwPbj9Tw&NR=1
/me 3laughs.
/me salivates at the sight of the sandwich on CC's table across the way
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "Bowser&#39;s Road (Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games)" - "I LOVE this version of Bowser&#39;s Road, or Road to Bowser. Whichever you wanna call it. This music is unlockable Dream music in Mario and Sonic at the Olympic ..."
/me 2trots across the street to the cafe
3Yeah, I know right?
BOOM
The Rock is Sad about this
Dumb fabriche rock!
Getting all hyped up for S2. I'll be watching it with you all, live.
That's what you get when you follow your horn, Zorotokon
3Any bets?
:P
Rainbow
I have to hit that.
Hi, Jen
Hey Razyn! Bring me back one of those sandwiches!
Hi Jen and yay~
13Things that would get you banned here, would be a first offense kick in most places I've modded.
10I'm gonna have to be honest and say that from my perspective he needs a scrutinised trial run.
/me 2goes to give the thumbs up, but can't
3Oh he'll bring back a lot more than a sammich Dashite.
MrMooMoo: My default answer is TF2
05From what I have read, I see potential. There are a few dodgy spots. I would suggest a trial.
Technically it's a geode.
TF3
10Like, he needs to prove he's going to be active
I'm guessing since it's live, the episode will be watched at 9 AM Saturday
A really big one.
4i bet 10 bits that she'll turn him down
Hey Barry, Sumica, etc.
Hat fortress 2!
4@RBD: No matter what, we decided that any new mod goes through a trial run
/me 11peaks over and sees the movements
Is that the first it airs?
All I want is the sandwich though.
07indeed
I thought it aired 6:30 PM
depends on time zone Barry
3Oh yeah? Well I bet 50 she does.
10Yeah but I mean a well-scrutinised trial run dude
Gotta rank up in Pony Fortress...
6I agree to trial run, and what RainBroDash said. We'll see just how much he is around.
13He's so new. But... if you guys want to give him a trail...
I love how Rarity's talent is to find all of the pre-cut pre-faceted gems lying around underground.
Hey, that sandwich is mine!
/me 2turns back to the cafe, more importantly, the mare at the table. "Is this seat taken, miss?"
4After the DE fiasco, we realized we need to scrutinize
3Er...she goes for him that is.
4you're on
/me shoves Dashite
13*trial
I will let you all know saterday what time it will be on.
9 AM EST
No jewelers needed in Equestria.
But i just downloaded GTA4
/me just beat Space Marine
Not this saturday, the 17th, but it is 9 EST
/me shoves GGgala back.
-thumbs up-
Dead island why!
DAMN IT WAS HARD
/me 3spits on his hoof and holds it out to DecapKing.
I asked for it!
11I-I think it would be best if you didn't.
10I think we need to focus very hard on him, just because he doesn't seem to have /that/ much passion so far. I may be wrong, but I have to say
You don't deserve it!
what was hard, Dermathil?
/me pounces on Dashite
/me 4does the same and shakes DE's hoove
(it was pretty darn hard on medium.)
...
Space Marine, Barry
I just beat it
ah
good for you
/me rolls GGgala off.
/me 4looks at the two fighting colts then back to DE
4So?
Who said anything about deserving?!
/me 3watches GGgala and Dashite fighting over the sammich.
4Trial run?
agg
my cable guide has one week in advance but i seem to have 8am pst stuck in my head.
is Dead island good?
idk
I see the models... I'm going to see if I can find someone to rig them >>
05My oppinion, yes.
10So yes to a trial run, but he needs close watching yeah
07and that concludes tonights show
what is this password
ME.
07I hope you all enjoyed
Mason_Trowel: I wanted to spar with you before. Now that I know how tall you are, I want to co-op with you against my other friends.
>mfw I JUST ARRIVED
/me punches Dashite
Q_Q
13I'm really really torn on him honestly. But a trial isn't a for sure, it's a nice way of determining eligibility though.
/me hugs Luna
10Thanks sathi:)
3...!
WHAT IS THIS CHAT
goshdarnit
Mason_Trowel: You're like a human projectile/rogue.
/me bucks GGgala.
and thanks anyways Luna
Hey Sky.
6Yes to trial.
4Octavia?
aaagh
I asked for the sandwich first, it's mine!
/me 2obviously feigns hurt. "Oh?" He stepped closer. "Hey, come on. Why not? I'm not that bad a guy."
4god this is more entertaining than watching that MILF pose from across the street
13Sure to trial.
:)
07Tomorrow more ;)
4Alright, I'll let him know
why?
Thanks!
Solo: I...don't know whether to be flattered or insulted by that comparison...
As always
4Marceline?
/me gets back to his hooves
Dari is sleeping.
3Think we should stop them DecapKing? Or do you want to wait and see if they warm up to each other?
10dermathil dari went to bed
I'll take it as a compliment, though
11Look, please just leave me alone. Go back to your... friends who seem to be... mating...
10he's back at school now
aaawww its over
Yeah
why is my name changed?
I still wonder wether I want to make GTA Equestria or not
4We're giving you a trial run
05thank you sahti!
Mason_Trowel: Probably neither. I'm ~6'5"/6'6"
4What the trial run entails is that you'll be under surveillance from the other ops and you'll be tasked with seeking out rule breakers and the like in the chat
Spike as Nico Bellic
it rolls throug my head like many other stories
4who the MILF and raze or GG and dash?
That sandwich deserves a true gentlecolt, not some ruffian like you!
Anyone under 6' qualifies as a projectile to me.
No Dee
/me THANK YOU SECOND BEST PONY LUNA
someone talk to me
4However
I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid
I do adaptions here.
4This doesn't mean you actually ARE a mod. You won't be given any commands to use. Your main task is to watch the chat, but be yourself too. DO NOT let on that you're watching for suspicious activity
tell me, Jigglypuff, now when did you last let your heart decide?
You're tall, Solo. I'm so small. T_T
/me wrestles Dashite to the ground
/me hugs Luna for sweet streams
Sky: I have no idea, but you are in the Equestria Daily chat room.
darnit, him too?
...Roman?
It's a sandwich! I don't think it cares who eats it!
no dee
Who's gonna stream stuff now?
i guess
Octavia: Who's your favorite house DJ?
not how it works
4Your trial run will be this Friday
Mason_Trowel: That's why we'd make a great team. I'd have them looking up, while you're sniping them from below :P
3The ones who are fighting, duh. If we mess with the other two lovebirds then that f's the bet up.
/me headbutts GGgala.
4Starting at 7 PM EST
10Is that copypasta?
I need to help ma with groceries
/me 2waved one of his forehooves. "Naw, naw. They ain't my friends." He looked back at them. "But neither are you, which is disappointing to say the least."
4good point
4But please, feel free to come in sooner
4Yep
Or we could pull a Fastball Special. Lol XD
10Because that's a really good little paragraph
13Nice wording and use of the trial run. I like it.
4Well
/me upper-cuts Dashite
4Most of it
I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
RAZYN!
/me 4tackles Dashite to the ground
WHERE IS MY SANDWICH!
NO ONE
Octaiva: Is Escher your favorite M.C.?
13Thats what I thought too RBD
Octavia* jesus
4you think you can get GG?
Sky: Reload the page or get an irc client.
/me kills himself for typo.
I can open your eyes
WildPlastic, david morales
/me 2flinches and turns around.
take you wonder by wonder
/me hits GGgala with a left hook.
Solo lulz
over, sideways, and under
/me 11Shifts away from Razyn. "Well I'm sorry to disappoint, but I am not interested in making new friends with such an... uncouth individual."
Your eyes are open!....
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
6That is gold Ghosties, like it
on a magic carpet ride
ProfessorOak: What are you talking about?
/me bucks DecapKing away from Dashite
a whole new world
a new fantastic point of view
4Thanks
/me 3pounces GGgala. Holding him to the ground.
STAY BACK. He's mine
!help
no one to tell us no, or where to go
He's singing the lyrics to "A Whole New World
or say we're only dreaming
He's quoting lyrics from Aladdin
i was thinking robot unicorn attack
3Hell naw.
Jigglypuffffff
how do i change my name back?
but... why? why would he sing in teh chat?
/me punches DecapKing.
Stay out of this!
4Everything from "We're giving you a trial run" is my own words taken from an earlier interview
4Everything down, that is
to get booted for spam?
10<Marceline>: I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
10?
jigglypuff jigglypuff
Probably just to spam.
/me struggles against Denied_Existence
Sky: go /nick Sky_
nah, I like you guys
Unidentified61232: /nick
but I feel the music in me!
10at 7 EDT?
lol the jigglypuff song
If you wanted to mount me you should've asked!

/me 4performs a single-hoof takedown on Dashite and puts him into a half-nelson
/me 3picks GGgala up and rolls him down the street.
noo
So use Sky_.
/me 3picks up the sammich.
To differentiate.
4We're going to set you up in a separate room. So if you see anything suspicious, alert it to us in that room
thanks man
Aw hell naw!
(>mfw since I found a pretty functional website for tv shows, how many things I could've streamed...)
Name yourself Sora.
thanks
jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglyjigglypuff
no
/me 3pokes Razyn in the back and hands him the sammich.
4and i wouldnt try to fight this Dash
now I'm in a whole new world with you!
how do i change it
/me slips out of the hold
It's Japanese for Sky anyway, and at least people will be able to tell you from Sky.
All right
3Here, have a present for the lady.
/me rolls and leaps through the air after the sandwich
/me tackles DecapKing
yes
/me 10congratulates Dermathil
4That concludes the interview, you are free to leave
There.
thxu peoples
/me 2shakes his head and turns back. "Uncouth nothing." He looks her square in the eye. "I'm just laid back. Nothing rude about being relaxed. But not letting someone apologize when they are genuinely sorry... That's a downright sin, right there." Razyn laughs. "Believe me, I know about sin."
I'll fight what I want to fight!
how do you say my little pony friendship is magic in japanese?
4In his interview, it said his work schedule is sporadic
/me 3clotheslines GGgala, knocking him of his hooves.
google translate!
/me 4bucks Dashite off of him, sending him into the tree
10well then we need to reschedule his trail ?
10trial*
I would ask my girlfriend but she isn't here.
doesn't it jumble the words?
4The basis that I suggested him on is if the new pony eps will air every Saturday between 9-10 AM
4Because that's when we'll really need him
/me 4notices the smashed bottle of Vodka on the ground
15(mfw for a second I thought CrystalClear left)
4oh
4hell
4no
/me snatches Denied_Existence's legs, dragging him down to the ground with him
10Yeah, but we've just said he can leave without having set a real trial date then
THE BOOZE!
10unless I have the complete wrong end of the stick?
NOOOO!
Dee depends on the language, Swedish is almost perfect, Spanish is iffy and anything Asian is hosed
4YOU ARE A DEAD PONY!!!
07[02:49] <Ghosties> Your trial run will be this Friday
07[02:50] <Ghosties> Starting at 7 PM EST
07[02:50] <Ghosties> But please, feel free to come in sooner
WHY IS THE BOOZE GONE?!
/me 3punches GGgala, bloodying his snout.
Hmm... I'm beginning to wonder something.
/me 4charges Dashite
eh...
10You can use the internet :P
10oops miscopypaste
My Little Pony: Tomodachigai wa Mahou
10<Marceline>: I'm going to have to, since I work on friday at 7
/me sidesteps the charge and sticks a leg out, tripping DecapKing
13Set him up in a separate room? We talking about after all the rooms are established?
10>work on friday at 7
WHat if I were to make a Pokemon OC, and then suddenly have him warped to Equestria?
Holy Crap, my mom just asked me to make Cupcakes!!!!
/me leaps on Denied_Existence's back, biting at his ear
10>miss the whole entire BMN?
Well brb!
....make em good
Oh.
That poor family.
that one came acros properly, though that's probably due to its short size
10ergo we need a new trial date surely?
13I was wondering that too RBD.
And he has to use his Pokemon to do deeds.
I'm living at the top of Equestria
/me 11scoots further away, looking very uncomfortable. "Well I appreciate the apology, and I accept, so now please leave me be. I'm just here waiting for this Marth filly or my son."
doin' something mean to it
/me 3puts all his hooves against GGgala's underside, and bucks upwards, sending GG flying.
/Giddyup/
Although, you'd probably need a 'desu' at the end of that.
So...
pokemon would be overpowered
07Well a new trial date would be the Euro - show?
Tomodachigai wa Mahou desu

Octavia: Would you consider collaborating with DJ Scatch (Dj-Pon-3)?
My pepsi bottle won't open... and is warm, can you send it to the moon for about... err 25 min?
I used bloody typefont
lol
In this white mare's world, I'm the one trollin'
10While we have many mods here
RainBroDash, dude, come on. I wanted to see what it was going to be
/me proceeds to punch Denied_Existence while he's down
I didn't break your damn bottle! You broke it when you dropped it while trying to hit me!
10What's happening with D_E for the future?
*pink mare's world
4wait i did?
"So goodnight, cruel world", that's what Luna told meh
4oh
/me feels interviewed.
YES!
10Or, has anything significant happened since I last checked?
4well sorry about that
4He's still on trial
Hah, and that's what you told meh
/me 3punches GGgala in the gut.
/me 3bucks his left, back leg into GGgala's groin.
10CrystalClear nope.avi
Trollin' way too much, I need a moment
WildPlastic, absolutely. i adore her completely.
No one mare should have all that powerNightmare's coming, I just count the hoursStop trippin, I ain't giving up the power'Til then, my parasprites, go devour
/me 2shakes his head. "If that's how you wanna be, fine." Razyn trots some ways off. "Just glad there's no bad blood between us." He waves to the mutant pony behind CrystalClear. "See you, Razyn."
/me 3continues to shrug off GGgala's blows.
4What most likely will happen is we'll give him half ops back before the season starts
4anyways i guess DE and i broke up the fight between you and GG
My little crazy schizoid mare
4Simply because we need the numbers
10Okay cool, so in effect is he being trialed again on friday?
Octavia, what is your opinion on bowties?
10sure
/me 15waves.
13Razyn got a trial? Did I miss that? lol
4and you can get a sandwhich
10I'm pretty sure he's learned his lesson about cooling it a bit.
Octavia: Ha ha, cool I'd love to her that album. Good luck.
07before your time Octa ;)
/me simultaneously strikes his hoof into Denied_Existence's mouth, knocking at his teeth
2Oh, hey I guess you want your title back, huh?
.....
/me 3bucks GGgala again in the groin, this time with both hooves.
10However I'd like to see how he does with half ops again
13I... dont think so. lol
*hear
13I remember his app.
/me 2tosses his name at Razyn_the_Pony
Blums, prefer standard ties, do not know why everypony wants to perpetuate the bowtie.
4want to go and stop DE and GG from fighting now?
Octavia: How do you feel about people asking you how you feel about a bunch of random shit?
/me 15catches the name.
lol
...
10 bits on GG
/me pouts
Solo, did you know racecar spelled backwards is racecar?
07yea but the app was posted 11 august ;)
lol wut
4If he continues acting like an ass, then he's permanently demodded
/me 3opens his mouth when GGgala swings a second time, then bites down hard.
4i dont know
NO ways!
/me 15inhales. "This feels... Better."
/me goes back to lurking now
WAYS
What is this, ask octavia day?
AHHH
10Sounds like a fair move
ok
Octavia: as a matter of fact, I did. It was part of a programming assignment when we were learning Stacks.
4he just got two hooves to the grouin
Octavia: Is it Ask Octavia day?
I think tat was suppose to be hank hill
Filter, is that a question? :)
4*groin
I feel like I can go back to drawing now.
I think it was enough of a break
/me bucks his hind hooves upwards at Denied_Existence's lower jaw
Luna_In_Socks, Yes, apparently.
/me 3bucks GGgala off once more.
sure
And I feel like I need to make more pony art.
Rainbow Dash would be a variety of flavors.
10have fun alliszero:P
/me 4walks over to CrystalClear
/me 15turns around. "So, Ms. Clear. I hope you don't think ill of my father."
Rainbow Dash: Is Rainbow Swirl
Could be Ziltoid
Octavia: What does Lauren Faust smell like?
Solo, i did not like stacks at first, then it just popped.
/me 3has one of his lower front teeth knocked from his mouth.
3Ah...hell naw.
4sorry about nearly hitting you when i threw my friend
Pinkie Pie = Cotton Candy, or Cupcakes.
Zorotokon, tacos
13Ah, yeah. lol Thought maybe it was initially posted a bit before. lol
Octavia: You're a programmer?
that nopolion icecream for Dash?
/me doesn't want to bother the fillies and colts with anything he couldask lol
Solo, as degree in programming

/me rears back and bucks Denied in the eyes with both hind hooves
/me 3rolls on top of GGgala.
WUT
15Sort of...
Octavia: Neat!
saywhat seth
13Ugh, think Razyn was one I really didnt like too. I cant even remember, so many applicants. D:
uh oh
Seth's snapped
well i guess i got to log off for now:/
11I'm so lost in this conversation
15I was created in lab.
Well, I think I'm going to catch a few hours of snoozey-time, while the moon is on course and my mean ol' sis is asleep.
/me 3has one of his eyes blackened, the other missed by the blow.
13As for DE. I think he's learned his lesson.
15He donated a part of himself to me.
oh that type of clop
Night Meteorventure
*Flutterrage* Seth how DARE YOU
15...And his name.
/me 3punches GGgala in the solar plexus (The lung area)
Octavia, I am so with you there, I'm working for an AS in Physics, and my BS will be CompSci
(I'm so lost trying to follow the other fight...)
EQD I am dissapoint
XD mfw
10oh shit awesome, it's chillout/progressivey housey music
/me wheezes and tries to shove Denied_Existence off of him
/me 3uppercuts GGgala, knocking 3 teeth from their positions.
11alrighty then...
10and it's apparently from the UK
10so win on that front
4oh excuse me miss.....
Good night, everypony! Enjoy my lovely sparkly night!
6How's everypony? :3
/me gets serious
13DE is friends with some others who are, eh... known. I almost wonder if part of the problem was he was getting a bit into himself.
11oh dear
Bpendragon, ayecarumba! physics? all I need to know about that is things fall when I trip over them
4uh i actually never got your name
/me 3sideswipes GGgala, popping an ear-drum.
Don't make me mad again.
I misses the "album" in dari's post because it said clop
Octavia: Any other academic credentials or interests?
10Better than youu :D
im alright
/me gets happy
10RDash as did I...
missed*
Bye-ee!!!!
Bpendragon: Nice. I'm working towards a physics minor and CS major.
Octavia: yeah, Physics
/me proceeds to punch Denied_Existence repeatedly, in the stomach, on both ears, and several times in the ribs
Solo, going for my masters in liberal arts..?
Octavia: Awesome
/me 3bucks GGgala in the shin, deadlegging his left leg.
Octavia: so basically you're just a Cool_Person (tm)
11*sigh* I am Crystal Clear
/me 3does the same to the right leg.
AGGGGGH
/me bites Denied_Existence's nose
**Cool_Pony
starving artist 4 lyfe
3FUUUUUUUUCKKK
15If you don't mind my asking, who exactly are you, Ms. Crystal Clear?
4oh, i am DecapKing, or thats what most ponies call me
11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJAPiRhRT8
/me 3headbutts GGgala!
I'm not an artist myself, just starving. :P
Cool tail, bro.
Solo, I'll actually double major in Mathematics and CompSci, minor in Physics (the school I'm looking at doesn't have a major in Physics, but their CompSci department is pretty good)
(I like how denied is describing all the injuries the other person is taking...)
11I am a Unicorn, of course
Sketchy: PONIES ARE PEOPLE TOO!
4By the way, DE isn't going to be given a trial
Goooood morning
You people.
/me grabs Denied_Existence's stallionhood between his forehooves and squeezes
<---is eating Quiznos
4I'm sorry if I made it sound like that
11(^ wtf man)
3MOTHERFUCK
13Power. Notoriety. Or rather "E-Fame", as much as I hate that word. These things can go to ones head rather quickly.
4'trial' meant that he was still on probation
goodnight:D i'm not sure whether i will stay up to get back on or if i will just go to sleep and get back on when i wake up but either way.. take care:D
13Oh?
Greetings Jazza.
/me headbutts Denied_Existence back
Hahaha. Nice. BPendragon, that's what I'm doing (also minoring in Psychology, and honors in the liberal arts)
/me 4turns to Dashite
(low blow man...)
4damn this is an entertaining fight
15I can see that...
(he started it)
Bpendragon: My school HAS a degree program in physics, but it sucks
Solo, the p is lowercase
Hello there Zoro
13I figured he was still on probation and we were just going to give him hop again at some point.
10'Probation' as in you're testing him?
/me 3headbutts GGgala repeatedly! A large gash is torn in GGgala's head!
10How?
NOW PLAYING "My Selene" ...*
/me 4turns back to CrystalClear
10Me people.
/me 3uppercuts GGgala again! 2 more teeth are knocked loose!
11(thank you boombox)
/me turns to DecapKing. "Excuse me a moment."
/me 3grabs GGgala, lifting him into the air.
welp
/me running tackles both GGgala and Denied_Existence.
How are you today Jazza?
Alright, break it up you two!
whaddyamean you people.
I'm very good
ponyville needs a coffee house
/me 3is knocked to the ground.
/me afks briefly to help someone around the house
4now Miss CrystalClear, i have a question
I have my first day at a new jov
*job
4You didn't hear?
3Fuuuck...man...
/me oofs
hello :3
4We temporarily demodded him
heyy
Good luck! Hope you do well.
/me cannot get up due to his broken hindlegs
Thanks
10Yeah, but what did you mean by probation?
...*
3Your legs aren't broken ya git.
Damn it...
10Like, how are you testing him?
4>temporarily demodded
4That's the probation
(Well, you know what happens to horses with broken legs... I'm sorry GGgala...)
Oh. Well that's alright then.
4He's in timeout for now
10..So suspension, not probation?
ponyville needs more pony
Ah, nevermind. Still have a few minutes before I'm needed.
(XD)
/me 15wonders what is wrong with all of his friends.
Coffee house, with some cool jazz playin ponies.
3But ya mouth appears to be in shambles.
4uh, Miss CrystalClear?
4Whatever
yess
but what shall it be called?
/me spits
4Basically, we're watching him
Yours, too.
/me 3laughs.
Bpendragon: If you ever want to talk shop about academics, just lemme know.
11yes?
Hi!
10Oh right, so you're watching him in chat still?
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:11h:52m:59s
3Eh, 1:5 is a good score.
05I'm so tired now im passing out any second. Good night to you all and good luck wit hthe apps
:DDDD
Almost only a week to go!
/me raises an eyebrow, wincing
4Pretty much
One to five?
Does it start in the AM or the PM?
10Cool, well I think he still needs to be on a sensitive 'trial-like' period for a while after he gets re-hop'd
4that pegasus that came over her earlier, did he ask you to do anything with him?
3Eeeeeeyup
what time
I'm not sure
10we need to see how he reacts WITH mod powers
noo
Quick! play more potato pack!
10to make sure he doesn't go OTT again
Where did you get /that/ number? Your plothole?
What's potato pack?
lol what?
11Nothing worth mentioning dear.
4so you said no to him?
3It isn't hard to count how many teeth hit you on their way out of your opponent.
/me 15eyes DecapKing
soo coffee shops
13I've talked to him a little bit. I think he's learned his lesson. For now at least. As long as he doesn't go back into again at some point.
House? wut?
10ofc we can just give him hop and then de-hop him if he acts like a tard, but I'd like to avoid having more random '+m -> SHOUT AT STREAM ABOUT NOTHING -> -m' moments
About a week and a half left.
That doesnt mean anything
think I read 9AM and 6PM
Haha Blums.
Best month ever - my birthday, new job, party on the weekend, season 2 of MLP!
aww man
11said no to what?
Sure it does.
10as have I octavia, but we need to make sure he doesn't slip back to how he was naturally before
I don't even like Diablo
which is it
but now I have to play D3.
Birthday on Season 2 premier. Gonna be so awesome. *dashface*
No.
lol the pony leak?
He DecapKing! Get over here!
10Just trying to be as honest as I can at the moment, I like the guy, but as we get more viewers we need to avoid any slip-ups at all.
/me 3gets up, then offers a hoof to GGgala.
what time!?
/)^3^(\ <-- Dashface
/)^3^(\ <--- I love this face. XD
honestly I wonder if Blizzard will get sued for their little level
/me 4turns to his friends
They ALWAYS use meta reference.
They won't.
3What now Dashite?
Sweet! :)
4HOLD UP IM TRYING TO TALK TO A LADY HERE!
why wub woo
WoW has a bajillion pop culture references.
/me 4turns back to CrystalClear
/me glares, though he can't quite remember why they were fighting at this point. He reluctantly takes the offered hoof
/me mutes
mk
no game will ever have more refrences than magica
13I know. lol
/me 3pulls GGgala up.
Man, why does my teacher keep making references to snorting coke?
13I'm just stating. I can tell he's mellowed out now.
/me is making cupcakes.
Yes, we are college kids, but this is Utah.
My teacher keeps referencing to little orphans in peril. But then again I'm taking Philosophy.
Hmmm, maybe The Alfalfa Club? Star-bucks? I'm not very good at this :)
4i think you know what i mean
/me looks back to Denied_Existence
/me 15winces
/me 3stares at Dashite.
star-colts?
10he may also just be mellowed out because he's unhappy.
Nothing...
10to be honest, like I can see it's affected him, being de-hop'd for now
11Oh? umm. Oh. OOHH... No, NOO of course not. He didn't even ask anything of the sort
13Well, hes unhappy he was put on probation.
/me 3raises an eyebrow.
(ponyshrug.jpg)
10ninja'd ;)
13But... I think he understands better now.
3.....
idk maybe
13lol
/me stares at Denied_Existence, then shifts to Dashite
*squeak
10and when he gets hop back, I don't want him to overreact with hyper happiness and go loopy
10that's my fear
/me 3shakes his head. Never quite understanding Dashite.
dat dash face.
13Eh, I don't mind him being super happy. As long as it doesn't effect his modding. There's only one sure fire way to find out though.
Ah, Utah. Haven't been there. My ex-girlfriend was going to go to BYU there, though, before she settled for BYU Idaho.
4oh, well i am sorry to bother you, also if you are looking for SilverMane, you might be able to find him at his job
11Oh? Alright. Thank you dearie
4i think he works at the pizzeria
15He has some of the most erratic hours, though.
I'm pretty damn sure no one in this classroom has done coke.
Maybe the teacher.
4you are welcome Miss CrystalClear
10pretty much
But that's it.
/me 4turns around and starts to walk back to his friends
4HEY DE YOU OWE ME 50 BITS!
This show hasn't been out for two seasons yet
3FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
3Fine
13Not like we can't take his powers away again if he acts up again.
but already has enough fanart to fill every gallery in New York.
10So. I'm listening to the Sonic Adventure 2 soundtrack
XD
10What are you listening to?
3Probably won money off Dashite too didn't you?
How large is your class, Zorotokon?
13If he acted up again this time however. Well, that's it.
10(@ all of you:D )
Probably about 80 as of now.
Pfft. Never.
4not sure
Was 100+ at the start.
/me 15turns back to CrystalClear. "He wasn't that bad, was he?"
I'm reading.
I am listening to 'My Selene' by Sonata Arctica
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJAPiRhRT8
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "My Selene - Sonata Arctica" - "Nocturnal poetry: Dressed in the whitest silver you&#39;d smile at me Every night I wait for my sweet Selene But still... Solitude&#39;s upon my skin A Life that&#39;s b..."
4besides he wouldnt even pay if i did win
Solo, it takes time to make a show. Equestria wasn't built in a day.
10ah I have a friend who rates them
11Umm, i don't know anymore
/me 3hands over 50 bits.
It was totally a non decision.
11i'm going to go now
10not my cup of tea though
/me 4takes the bits
At this point it's getting harder to creat OC. Almost every cross over has been done.
My Selene is a perfect Luna-love song
15Need company? It is dark out.
4damn you guys are fucked up
JackiePie: I...know. I'm more marvelling at how amazingly active this fandom is.
Yeah it's awesome!
WildPlastic: Nonsense. It hasn't been crossed over with Majesty yet.
/me puts a foreleg around Dashite's neck, showing a bloody grin.
Plastic, just wander back in time.
3Thank god I have a good bit of money.
all about Endymion and Selene from Greek mythology
You know Dashite? YOu're all rigt, man.
*right
The present is where 99% of fan stuff happens.
WildPlastic: and no one has done my most awesome Street Fighter IV Dan Hibiki trains Pinkie Pie in Saikyo crossover yet!
4hows the damage on me?
3(And toothy to say the least.
(also, Selene was the original name for Luna, if you didn't know)
Just so long as you don't try to steal my sandwich next time.
:p
11I'm fine
Hmm, true.
10who was it who used to use the name Endymion when they went to sleep
There's been a crossover image of Fist of the North Star and MLP
10I can't remember
but no crossover fic
07indeed
It also hasn't been cross over with other eighties and early nineties shows.
/me mutters, "I'll let you have *my* sandwich..."
which is where I will come in
10like, in the IRC
What was that?
I can name quite a few.\
not a clue
10sadhsaf
Nothin', bro.
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
10it's on the tip of my tongue
Mason_Trowel: quite a few Fist of the North Star/MLP Crossover fics?
/me is listening to Clop. what a name for an album.
15If you say so. ...Try to... 'Loosen up', would you, Ms. Clear?
/me wishes he was better a drawing lol
Endymion was a man who was in love with Selene, and if I remember correctly, died waiting for her whilst she resided on the moon, a goddess.
4guys how fucked up am I?
Octavia: I think they're trying to un-dirty the word
No, no, Solo.
3Yer fine.
There is a fanfiction very similar to that story, about Luna as Nightmare Moon
10I think this may even have been before I met you silver
Clap!
3Just a few bruises
MFW waifu knows who i am
Oh, I'm listening to silence, but will be going through my usual rounds of pony songs soon ;)
I wasn't saying I could name quite a few fics that crossover with FotNS

You know those Stalliongrad colts.

13No, you must tell me noa! >:(

I think it's on your end

Although, I do look younger than my age, people mistake me for a teen sometimes because I guess I dress like one.
Is your mom a brony, Jackie?
Only if your mom isn't a fan.
being as i am one of the oldest bronies around, i would have someone to talk to
Yeah
/me wonders if CrystalClear is gonna have anything to say on fathers being dicks with brains
13Dont be stealin mah colors.
0What? That chat isn't white, sillllyyyy.
The closest one to me is Colorado Springs but I don't know if I have any intention to go to one.

Well then what's the issue?
0Sorry! I just wanted to try them out. >_<

Twilight told me this video is about GIR LOVES TACOS
Jazza!
night all, just popped in to say that
you just missed him Tink...
9Oh
or her...
RDash. I'm not sure we should post any Brony Cola pictures with Pinkie in the room. Far too scandalous for a young lady.
or his mother...
Twilight, Identify thyself!
TAQUITOOOOOEEEEES
/me glomps Jazza not twice, but ten times!
4well one of us has to get into Silver's house for this plan to work
Oh phew, I didn't do anything sexual... I thought this was #EquestriaAfterDark
But seriously, we should be the last ponies on EARTH to put down Freddie THE MAN Mercury.
something like that, anyway, pass it on
will do.
/me rolls around in her big huge ponied up truck blasting pony songs. everythings bigger and more more annoying in texas.
13Wait! I'm going to to disappear for a moment! Hehe! (AKA BRB)

"nNGHH! WHERE'S. MY. MOOOOUUUTH?!?!?" xD
lol Gir
*truck
Sorry to hear that Mirth, we'll let him know.
I was the turkey the WHOLE TIME!
Me!
do you have a cardboard twilight cutout in the back?
Now we have a drunk erect Denied_Existence to use in an elaborate prank. Wish us luck.
For those not in the know, bonsawa-ru means good evening in Japanese
Gir wants to be a mongoose
no truck is complete without cardboard twilight cutout
Which flatters me to no end
Blums, rbd front license plate, octavi and twilight stickers in the rear windows
13Hmm
aww
Hmmm?
good evening
^^
/me has a van with a card board cut out of Rarity.
I should ponify my truck...
What
4well anyways, just look for the spare key underneath the doormat
Does that count?
13The Great and Powerful Trixie...
6Hallo Trixie~ ;3
15My text is now a slightly darker shade
sure zorotokon XD
Wish I could talk more here
Isn't it konban-wa?
I only know konichwa or whatever is it spelled
Ah. Brilliant security, that.
Never heard that one before however
11FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE
I wish you could talk some more too
15Oh my
13Twilight and Trixie have the same IP
13Guys
Although, I think my dad would get mad if after not bothering to paint the truck for 2 years, I finally do but in pony.
13Lets log in as all 6 mane ponies
4yeah, im suprised with all of the stalkers he has had over the years he doesnt have any better security
/me 15feasts eyes
13And scare the admins
13Lol
6Yus
6Though that's a lot more formal, the usual form in Konbanwa as well Barry~
Everything is even more normal than it was before.
15How would we scare them?
6I'm keeping Trixie though :P
13Keeping as in registering?
13Lol
9We could just start roleplaying as the mane 6 in bronystate XD
13BACK!

MFW Polarfire didn't make it back ;_;
....
11TRIXIE NEEDS NO REGISTRATION
I hate you johnsey
13Its turning out to be a prank
13Aww... that's not a very nice prank though.

13D_
13D=
Free dict doesn't recognize it, though.
15I speak only the truth
13-puts a hoof against herospirit 's chest- Don't make me mad!
Mongoooses love to gnaw on things.
It's natural.
Yes I do
4well you take him over there while i go and try to find Silver's mom
That pic of Sethisto on ponibooru looks like Dan Akroyd.
15What did I do, M'lady?
/me 13ties herospirit up and puts duct tape over his mouth
13-pauses- Oh wait, you already did that.
Mason, don't forget to to add glitter!
11herospirit TRUTH WELL SPOKEN MY LOYAL SERVANT
/me 15nods
13...
13Okay
13From now on, we are the nicest people in Bronystate
/me 13has a slight hiss in her voice
alright, leaving early today. Cyall guys.
/me slumps Denied_Existence down on the floor on his back
/me 15shakes head
Okay, then

/me 6turns page
/me 4walks off

3You didn't think that a stallion with the talent to understand the mind would stay drunk for long did you?
...
11I BE GONE!
11*poof*
13Would someone be so kind as to log in as Applejack and Rarity?
13How do you DO that?
/me jumps at the sound of Denied_Existence's voice
OHAI THERE
13I mean. How do you do the action thingy?
13Type /me
3Oh don't play silly filly with me, I have been awake the whole way here.

0Oh my GOSH speaking of Japanese and Ponies I have something to show you!
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
9Hmm, I don't know who I would be good at
/me wraps her front hooves around HotCocoa in a tight embrace
3(OP?)
/me 4walks back
(over powered0
!muffinkiss
/me regurgitates a whole, fresh looking muffin and approaches Zorotokon, showing her most adorable kissing face
/me 15begins to push the tape off his mouth using his tongue

/me clops her forehooves together excitedly
..what?

/me is eating ramen

/me 13blows up then reforms as a balloon then blows up again and turns back into herself
/me 13bricks Herospirit

/me 4looks down and sees DE awake
I like ramen
4oh hey DE

I love how two people quit after I declared my dinner
!plot
Go have real food.
*wigglewiggle*
/me glances between DecapKing and Denied_Existence
3(I can't actually read minds, just understand them.)
/me 15digs under the bricks
/me 6jots down a few notes
but the mention of food makes me want to puke
15but M'lady
Dat plot.
13Herospirit
13Open 2 tabs
3(And be a bit clearer in the head at the same time.)
really? awesome! o_o
13Type in Rarity, and Applejack as your names
Too much pasta
13And join here
13We need all of the Mane 6
(Denied needs more booze)
!plot
*wigglewiggle*
15You say we are nice...
3(xD)
That's new.
4well this puts a stop to our prank i guess....
15does that mean we are ceasing the PLANS?
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
13No
!clop
/me clops her forehooves together excitedly
..what?
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3

Season 2 begins in 10d:11h:02m:14s
0Yup. ^^
15The PLANS are not very nice, M'Lady
3On the contrary, now that you are here, you can take my place DecapKing.
13How is it mean?
Keyframe..um
COOL!
VE GO!
4wait what?
That was kind of awkward
13Okay
13Ze magicks?
Metal chips in my fingers
Is it internet contagious?
/me glances down at Denied_Existence, then at DecapKing
13Here is what we are gonna do
uhh... whoa
/me 3smirks.
I didn't know you were taking Japanese, Pinkius
I don't think he's as... ready... as you are.
Mongoose: I'm right here.
/me 3gets off the floor.
13Log in as many ponies as possible
How did you get metal chips in your fingers?
13Starting with the mane 6
4REALLY GG?
YEZ, Ze Magicks!
3Oh, yeah...forgot about that...
I work in a machine shop
13And then popular background characters
/me pokes Sidestroke
I thought so
0Yup! Well this is my first year in college, but I already have taken two and a half years in highschool. ^^
13And the CMC of course
Oh, so you didn't get a tetanus shot?
/me pokes Octavia too
15You know nothing of mean pranks! M'lady has us on the greatest, meanest prank of all!
13Why don't we just have ONE specific character?
/me hurfs.
/me gets poked
I want to learn Japanese!
3Eh...not like its the only night I have spent alone, it will go away eventually.
13But Herospirit...
13That would be mean to spam with ALL of the mane six.
I've worked here for 3 months... last week I work... chips in my skin
I need
Man, what part of 'integral' did you not get?
Pictures of Luna!
I already know a few words
Help me bros
13We arent going to spam
3Besides, not really into older women like Decap.
13We are going to mess with the Admins a little
And I know up to 100
Just.... BWarakljsa;lsdkjfoiuwer,lmsdf
Either it's an infection, or you're becoming metal like that guy on X-Files.
sdfhjsdhfsdfjksdfghasdfkfsd

SO MANY LAG
but i can't see the season unless somepony upload to youtube u.u
15M'lady has the wits and cunning to crush the spirit of her enemies.
I don't get infections
That's what we call dramatic disconvenience.
oh, so we're poking now?
things get infected by me
4dude she couldnt of been that old
3(Also, I AM the son of an alicorn)
Firelight someone is doing a live stream I think
13Ahahaha.. Herospirit.. Such a card
Ze tyme iz ze monies!
RainbowDashCancel: no, I'm just bored.
/me infects everything around him
15I have half a mind to inform the new Pinkie of THE PLANS

3She is silver's mother, she is old enough.
First person that pokes like this wins the poking game:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_A_OzL7Lcg
15: I
(Denied is also delusional)
I'd have to look it up
13Hm
13Mmmmm I still think all of us logging in as the mane 6 is a little mean. I mean, why not just stick to ONE character?
I go!
3(:()
15PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS
0Japanese is fun. ^^
13How is that mean Pinkius?
thanks ^^
(I think it's all the booze. It's affected his memory)
13Because then we're spamming them aren't we?
/me 3pats DecapKing on the shoulder.

3We'd better go GG.
/me 6locks door
Animal Planet has an interesting show on called Human Planet
Welp.
RainbowDashCancel: I am talking to myself

/me 6turns to first page
O-Oh my.. Twilight?
Oops
3Especially before the pheromones kick in.
Pinging is like tickling.
FUUUUUUU
It's about how people adapt to different environments.
wow
Was supposed to be Fluttershy
XD
/me grabs Decap's hind legs
What was that, sugarcube?
Before the what now?
You can't do it to yourself and if you keep doing it it gets uncomfortable.
3Naw, just leave him here.
6I like pizza~ c:
why is thre a MLP wiki out there with hardly any info about FIM?
3Well I had to make him ready SOMEHOW...
Herospirit, I have an idea
What if we sung Winter Wrap up in the mane chat?
XD
it even refers to FIM as "set to air"
So, I have callbacks for the play
3It's "Integral"
Zorotokon: Pong.
/me 15is worried he can't do a very good Applejack
It wouldnt be easy..
5IDEEEAAA!
like it's been totally abandoned
aww come on
/me raises eyebrow, glance down at Decap
Would require alot of coordination
I will be back
There's three parts they liked me for.
He he.
Zorotokon your statement about not being able to do something to yourself, gave me naughty thoughts
9That would be awesome!
*Zorotokon* Pong.
Don't worry, it works.
/me 15does not have Winter Wrap Up memorized
I see...
Bpendragon wonders if he (other than the great and powerful Trixie) is the only pony to talk about himself in the third-pony often. Could someone please answer this for him?
I'm just used to being pinged a lot.
/me 3trots out the open door. A delighted smirk on his face.
/me 9has winter wrap up memorized
Im honestly not sure which characters have which parts
13The sad thing is that I don't just imitate Pinkie Pie I can do all of the mane 6 if I want to. >_> Helps to be a girl though.

PREPOBILOSITY!!
3I will admit the statue would have been a nice touch.
/me 15puts "do not disturb" sign on Twilight's door and walks away
Zorotokon: Bpen gets pinged because some of his friends in another channel call him "bp" and so he has it set as an auto-notify, which he then gets pinged for whenever anything ponibooru comes through
Notice how all of the Mane 6 is here
13Meeehhhh.
/me thinks something is going down tonight
ha ha
Wow.
Wow that is cute!
Heh. Mountception.
15Hey Pinkius, did I mention we had PLANS?
I want one =D
/me 3facehoofs.
Erm.. We lost Rarity..
-.-
6The time has come to welcome spring
13I know. =w=; But they're so confusing!

13RARITY IS GONE
3Yeah...whatever you want to call it...
NO!
We can't lose Rarity!

Nice Power Thirst reference, CogWeaver.

4mommy?
9@confusedmeter Pinkius
0Rarity got kidnapped again?! Was it the diamond dogs?!
6 Pinkius is 87% confused. (1531)
15The PLANS are the reason the bunker exists
Maybe
Hey! Aren't we gonna even watch?!
Spike'll save her!
brb
13I don't get it! Ahhhh!
Lyra/BonBon and Octavia/DJPon3 only shipping I'll ever allow
0Awww okay!
and that's because it's ridiculously cute
Right after this commercial break!
15COUNFOUND THESE PLANS. THEY DRIVE ME TO DRINK
4no, no get away from them.....
And now we lost Applejack..
/me 3motions to a tree situated outside a window.
what
NO
/me 3closes and locks the door.
Wait what?
ABUUUUUUUUUUUUU
What about Caramel x Big Mac M/M shipping?
6These plans drive me to clop
That okay?
Oh, you.
yes.
Hey, that FlutterMac shipping pic was also very cute.
and most of them are musical ponies
How are we losing all these Ponies?
/me eagerly climbs tree
except bonbon she doesnt fit
/me 3clambers up the tree.
13I'm just really confused in general! -giggles- Oh well.
15Pinkie_Pie, has our operation gone any further? I'm going crazy over here
/me kicks bonbon out
NOOOOOO!!!!
lol
15and TWILIGHT HOW DO YOU KNOW OF THE PLANS
15err
Random break for teacher taking a phone call.
Of course we /could/ have had our own fun first with those phera-things...
/me flies after BonBon
We also just lost Twilight Sparkle
Everyone gets out there phones!
0Who knows but it's not good!
But still, Applejack can take care of herself. She's not afraid of getting dirty
Most Caramac is quite adorable.
im just watching this

/me jumps.
/me splats.
scary
lol
See?
oh dear
/me sighs regretfully at the missed opportunities of life
i see
well, HoN seems to be fucked up
13Nothing else can be progressed, its all down to Silvermane and Denied_Existence finishing
guess I'll just play some Sc2
...
Twilight Sparkle can teleport out of a sticky situation
13Which they can take their sweet time with anyway
Caramac is my favorite ship.
13-sits down, starts to eat popcorn-
15:[
Fluttershy can STARE the sh*t out of anyone
3(Somepony get on the phone to CC.)
0At least Rainbow Dash is ok
15I am frightened of what we have started Pinkie_Pie
13Herospirit, am I gonna have to download a proxy to log into the rest of the mane 6?
...This *is* Silver's house, rigt?
yeah, rainbow dash can outfly everyone
oddly enough
13We lost Applejack, Rarity, and Twilight...
15How bad will it crush the man?
Well I thinkthebronyshow.net does some live streams
3Yeah....
I think RD is the pony with the less chances to survive any think
Eeyup. My older brother's whining about my mom when she's doing the right thing.
anything*
13He will get over it.
I could've sworn Decap almost said something about him moving away...
I think I just failed at cooking lol =X
17. That's how old he is.
wb mexican.
0Zephirdd Exactly, she's usually the first to get killed off XD
sup bronies?
0Oh god! Revenge?
15And what of the stream on the fateful day? Will our collective sanity hold?

Are you sure he's whining?
...Did somepony say my name?
thax
Or just complaining?
OMG
Flash, y u no stop imploding
I put cereal into a bowl, then milk... then all of a sudden it burst into flames which I had to quickly put out =X
/me hugs Fluttershy
/me hugs Luna
Hi Fluttershy
15The clopping
Lyra: Whining, but not as bad as Rarity.
We're discusing caramac shipping now.
15OH GOD THE CLOPPING
3I don't remember him saying such...
the what?
/me peers in the window a little closer
What about that John Cena guy?
O.o
Erm.. Yeah... Ignore me for now
The Luna song sounds like an anime theme song
Ha.
It's funny.
Lyra: He whines like Rarity.
!muffin
Because Caramel runs a delivery service.
Muffins!! You have any? :3
yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps mexican
He's a shipper.
13Oh you silly fillies there's probably a ipaddress tracker that wont let you log in as more than one character at a time.
i don't remember how is caramel :P
/me hugs Fluttershy and Luna
/me 4starts to come to
No, I meant, is he whining like John Cena?
9Alright, bed time for me

Good night

13Or maybe you should try it on a different browser. ^^ Whatever the case it wont work if you just try it in different tabs.
Oh and, did I mention that a shipping thought suddenly hit my head when I hate ponyshipping?
13Night Dashie!

I think the link Unidentified46124 is fake. >_>
oh
canfound this chat
ok, love poems can wait till the morrow, I find they are better if I right them right before I deliver them. PnF is due in a week and a half, so working on my fic it is.

S'mores 3-way anypony?
cheer up people
hey
racist?
Alright :3
H-Hi...
Dat me
wut
05there we go
Hm, windows automatic updates.
05can be a bitch sometimes cant they?
nicserv goes ping
9 days 21 hours
T_T
Eeyup.
yay
Hell even the fact the D 3 has a ponie secrate level has me little hyped
What happened last night?
[16:04] Hm, windows automatic updates.
yay windows!
your hosting just this channle and few others right dari?
Lawl no.
I mean IRC wise
I'm hosting the server and the services server.
Wrek's hosting another server.
Hi, Wrek
Hi, Dari
Hey Barry.
So if both you and Wrek had your computers turned off, we couldnt get in?
Eeyup.
05ohai
That's why computer's supposed to be on all the time.
I see
05so far mine hasnt been acting up too much
ohay again ponies
05gona need a few to move it to the new server once it arrives
Hi RobotPinkie
it's also why everypony love linux severs they don't downtime due to updates randomly
05but other than that i should have a stable uptime
but then you can fix that on windows too
hooray, services are back :D
Wrek, wont a new bunker cause my precious Bunker and everyones registered names to dissapear again?
New server*
Hi Pinkie_Pie
Hi Barry
Or does NS/CS keep up with that
wtf youtube y u recommend me so much g3.5 shit?
Fuuu
05all that data is stored at the service one iirc, besides no information is changing, jstu an hardware update basically
youtube is a troll
Passport export server is screwed
05though dari might want to correct me on that
Well since we'll be moving, when we do, everything needs registering again, yeah.
Hmm
We shouldn't be moving again after this though.
is BMN ect still looking for mods cos I'm more than willign to help out
Ohai RobotPinkie
ohay WhatPayne
HAI ROBOTPINKIE
Howsit going?
ohay Rodman
Oh hey RP
eh, lots of phlegm but it could be worse, how's u guys?
Good
everyone is ILL today
I'm not
Whatchoogaisdoing?=
it's my fault, my hugs infected everyone :(
nothing much, Rodman
Aww still sick?
It's ok RobotPinkie
right can I be bothered to work on my IRC cilent today
writing an IRC client?
Surprisingly I'm not ill even through I've been quite close to sick people lateley
yeah libpurple based something better than the base one in pidgin
I have an old totlay home made client but I've lost the source and it had issues
and I hacked up a text only one a few days ago also libpurple based
haven't ever used pidgin for IRC...
it's ok
you're running linux, i'm guessing
if you don't mind ugly ways roudn soem issues and bitchy formating
nope not right now
window's 7
just like pidgin
also I've farted around with libpurple enought to custom plugins ect
okay
though yeah I liek to have some programs that are multi OS based I dont have a Linux partion on here yet but I'm saving for an extra HD to make it fesable
dunno much about pidgin, I used it for a while because it was the standard IM program in Mandriva...
it's popular though, so...
http://p.mdcd.net/product_images/full/45088d763f5d1a90ab6af7ff344a57890860b6ef.jpg
*related
yeah it's really fexiable also a really low foot print compaired to say running windowsLive and or AIM ect
official clients do tend to suck
yeah
Pidgin has a 30,000 k foot print in my memory and I'm in 3 IRC severs, pretty much every IM net work
and chatting heavily on a number of them
pidgin's biggest flaw is lack of video/audio
but that's what skype is for
I guess that's true... it'd be nice with an easy to use cam/voice app that was more open though.
MFW the 'pony' Diablo level doesn't really have any proper pony references
Pidgin is working on it but it's a lot of work
It doesn't? well, color me disappoint
The closest there is to a reference that I see is the enemy horse called:
Unique_TentacleHorse_A Midnight Sparkle
That could just be coincidence.
THe rest of it contains no proper references IMO.
MeteorVenture, what was that command to add Auto Op?
Agree Dari
I wasn't very ecstatic about it either
turns out i showed up to this wyrd 101 thing about 2/3 through this podcast (if it even is a podcast)
thes Nightmare is Magic
anyway i'm not sure.. what do you mean by auto-OP?
Make it so that someone is made OP when they come in here
Im testing something
So anything in the form of x is magic is now an MLP reference?
nope
and "Nightmarity"... though there's zero evidence that not all of them are just coincidences
oh.. well.. i'm rather unsure.. i remember something like.. setting authority levels for people
yep
I beleive
but idk if that's the same as making someone OP or anything
believe*
but they still have to register for it to stick
and then they will be OP or whatever they were upon logging in
/msg cs help set
Owait
Maybe it's not a set command
I think that it's quite likely that all that is just a reference to their april fools joke from way back when...
Maybe
http://madgearsolid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/diablo3unicorn.jpg
ah i wasn't aware these options were here
i'm sure everyone remember that...
Okay
Thanks, it worked
that's helpful
Don't remember it.
Nope
yeah, and all the stick Diablo 3 got for haveing more colour than red and brown
x3
did you identify yourself?
People were complaining about D3 being too bright and colorful
AOP isnt gonna work if I dont identify
Thats the idea..
because they were idiots, and hadn't played D2
I have 3 mane 6 names registered
I want other people to be able to use them
x3
But, AOP wont work unless identified
I mean OH no colour!
Colour must mean a shit game....
What a world..
so blizzard did a prank with a series of screenshots with rainbows and stuff
why would you want anyone to be able to be OP?
yeah
i mean upon just using a nickname they don't even have registered
Because I cant use all 3 of these names myself
I am guarding them from people who would enforce
I'm guessing the D3 cow level will therefore have unicorns and rainbows
So that anyone can use them
still even if planed as a joke pony level from pre FiM dosen't mean no FiM nods
But, I am finding limitations in my idea
true, FiM would fit very well with that theme
yup
even just the mild naming nod that are hinted at now
you might be able to make a script
that automatically gives OP to whoever is those names
as it does look like tey planed a unicorn and rainbow level as a joke
yeah, doesn't seem too far fetched, but I guess we'll see
but that's like giving anon admin powers
yup we'll see
It wouldnt work like that
What I mean, is I want people to be able to use it for their own purposes
I am protecting these names from people who will turn enforce on and therefore disallow usage for others
Protecting what?
Names Denied
Names
now i want to play diablo 2 :(
Well I caught that much.
Which ones eh?
phone suppoooorrrtttt
I have Rainbow_Dash, Pinkie_Pie, and Fluttershy registered, to prevent people from enforcing them
I want other people to be able to use the names to
have you tried turning it off and on again?
But it is proving complicated, because things like Auto-Op and other automated services wont work if you cant identify
That's good.
x3
Whats good?
never had to do that
Haha
my only IT job was one as a code monkey
Yeah there's a button
lol
then I was laid off
Button on the side
Is it glowing?
What you're doing I guess?
Yeah, then you need to turn it on
was funny being a code monkey I thik I did more coding than my bosses
sent me soem right messy shit to debug
Oh, I guess, but I dont know what I can do about the limitations
uncomented, goto's the work
was utter black box code if it worked
How many earth ponies were watching the Best Young Fliers contest?
As complicated as what?
The only fix I can think of, is making me a sort of overseer of the names instead of a direct owner
we are observant... not autistic
that doesn't sound fun
two
there are probably some errors
i think 3
Its so much to retype if I have to explain it again
D=
It was held in Cloudsdale. There can't be many.
I just rewrote it in the end
What limitations?
Applejack and Pinkie, nay?
"You are born in the bunker, you live in the bunker, you will die in the bunker!"
asked his boss for the breif and did it behind his back
I'll need names, of course. Not just random guessing numbers.
Okay...
i wouldn't call myself a programmer, but sometimes looking at the code of other people who call themselves that makes me wonder....
Torrenz: Anypony else?
it was that shit and he wouldn't take I'm not debuging that shit as an answer
I have Rainbow_Dash, Pinkie_Pie, and Fluttershy registered, I want other people to be able to use them as well
Lol
You said overseer, I have fallout on the brain.
he my personal code is a mess but I never expect any one to need to look at it
does winged dr hoof count?
whoof
The limitations I am talking about, is that Automated services like AOP do not work unless the account is identified
I don't actually remember, just assuming since those are the only ones that should be able to stand on clouds
if I know the source will need matainign god I work hard to maek it readable and documented
not that my code is THAT much better, i usually just write really sloppy scripts to take care of stuff
Nope, he was a pegasus.
it is an alternative universe version of him
Pinkie, AJ and any guards Celestia brought with her
all the earth ponies
I put this name on the AOP list, and it only works when I identify
brought by a error in the fabric of time
most fun I had ever was righting in machine code
it was horrid
Well of course.
Guards are pegasi though D:
but fun
You don't want any random person to get op automatically in your channel.
Three is the correct number. Applejack, Pinkie, and one other pony who'd known for bending the laws of pony physics.
mostly as I know most people can't do it
Then Pinkie and AJ
Yeeeah I can't fathom how that is
Is it possible to add something like a "Master Password" on the name, and have other people be able to add their own?
the more you know
So that I would be able to watch over the name, but other people could use it without limitations
its HORRID and I doubt I coudl do it now
That's one of those things I'd be interested in doing just because of that :p
...shut HER quick.
And the CS/NS could identify them with their own unique password
so, what's this? random trivia quiz?
Of course, that sounds quite complicated..
yeah you get an elitest kick form machine code programing
You seem to miss the point of registering a name. :P
but is to slow for real work
Absolutely, dude. I'm bored here.
Registering a name is so other people can't use it.
Why would we need that?
Okay, time's up.
leroy?
Lyra's also there, hopping around in the background of a few shots.
Yeah, I bet
like 50 odd bits for ad fro reg balh to reg blah out put to blah
They can use the name w/o a password already!
My point is here, I dont want someone to take these names and enforce them so that others cannot use them
I want to prevent that
and yoy have to do every thing with reg manipulation
Best shot to see her is near the end, behind Rarity as she apologises to Dash.
Lyra :3
But really my programming is quite basic, been a long time since I did it now
so any none basic math is a REAL bitch
The password only protects your Op status in here.
Which by registering them, and not enforcing them, you have.
isnt lyra a unicorn?
therefore no earth pony?
Gilda is just pointing out Lyra was there
You can't have multiple people registering the same nick though regardless.
i see
which is good
Because that defeats the whole purpose of the registration system.
Meh..
It literally makes the whole thing defunct.
poor bonbon
I hated pointers and stacks more than anything
Makes sense to me Dari
Because two people can't use the same nick at the same time.
Sorry, iks, you're right, I thought she was an Earth pony. Bad question.
stacks?
I think that makes just three unicorns, though.
What about Fuck Shit Stacks?
So if you register that nick to more than one person.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfZTr8zMsc
:P
sounds good to me
Hold on
Hahaha
stacks aren't that nasty
And each need the nick to get ops, owner, or whatever in different channels.
its GUIs I hate coding
Then both can't be on at the same time.
fuckign interfaces
I just hated them, I have a hard time with abstract thinking
Better question, why is Lyra stalking Twilight?
Which is why I had a super hard time with pointers
Trying to get magic lessons of course
I think im frying my brain
sudyed philosophy, comupting and mathamtics you can see where my head sits
Secret crush?
I'm not stalking anypony.
That might explain why Bon Bon's so damn grumpy every time she opens her snout....
well it seems like it's time for me to go to sleep
Okay
Bye MeteorVenture
G'night MeteorVenture
Hey, Cokes.
goodnight yall:D
Hey Gilda.
Sup Gilda.
'Sup.
God, it sounds like my father's parties in here.
I'm sure you don't know me. *shrug*
Or you saw my nick change.
when programers start talking
lolol
Where?
Well, no, not really, unless you count nick-change messages.
your dad sure knows how to party
Haha
XD
http://www.youtube.com/user/qwert13y me, starting a vlog
can't beat the parties with my old mates id studyed philosophy with
Mmm I figured.
hey Gilda
Yeah?
Did all the ponies who want to be friends with Twilight follow her to Ponyville? D_D
A philosophy party sounds bearable.
are you a big mean grumpy mean meanie pants? 3:
half the night was serriors philosophy the rest was use utterly wasted
and it wasn' in that order
I just assumed that ponies bounce around between Ponyville and Canterlot regularly.
/me 's eyes narrow
i like parties that have ponies and beer, but that's just me
I mean, what better philosophy than to party?
Do I look like I'm wearing pants?
hello all
Lyra stalks her even when she goes to Cloudsdale...
hay
CREEPY...
Vodka myself. But I cant legally drink yet goddamnit
Can't keep a crush like that down. Literally, in that case.
DeniedExistence, there is but one better philosophy
PARTAY
Lol
best ones are otnerlogical deabtes when every one is one pint of vodka down or more
Dat EQD post..
0_o
someone should make some pony themed drinks
New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: At Her Majesty's Pleasure (http://tinyurl.com/3zgkzlb)
well someone probably has already
that sounds saucy
been done
at least 3 sets
but I need to up my mixing game to pull some of them off
So are there lots of Lyra/Twilight shippings? :G
Clopclopclop
Why does she have to be stalking Twilight? Why can't she just be one of those ponies who's everywhere?
Like Pinkie Pie
I don't really want to read about Court...
where, though? i haven't seen any
soem have been posted on EqD
Seen the shot glasses....
....but no drinks.
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/pony-alcoholic-beverages.html
Pinkie Pie isn't in Canterlot where Lyra is trying to be friends with her...
two sets in one post there
what if lyra is ALL THE PONIES
secretly
D:
What if Bon-Bon was ALL THE PONIES?
secretly.
The Trixie one is just funny
3.5 oz of water
there should be a t shirt that says "ALL THE PONIES"
just that.
with lots of garnish
Sitting in a PreCal class yesterday, the girl next to me has her netbook out. I glance over at it; it's on a page with a "20% Cooler" shirt. Win!
Happy Neither Rain nor Snow Day, everypony
lol that's a good one
The Big Phony Pony...
well, it did rain a bit in the morning
Dunno, think it's raining here.
No, it's a day for postal workers.
Gilda's Fiery Bitch soudn soooo good
oh.
awww stomping pubs with pudge
glom of nit?
sooo refreshing
Abdesius, that's awesome.
Are they... disgruntled postal workers?
you should've told her "your uh, your notebook needs to be about... 20% cooler"
You know, "Neither snow nor rain not hear nor gloom of night, stays Ditzy Doo from the swift completion of her appointed rounds."
I totally would have if it wasn't in the middle of a lecture. :D
shoulda said it after 9__6

I like the way this guy thinks with his drinks
can tell he does it as a job
Just going to leave my laptop open with a pony sprite wandering around the screen.
not assertive enough
omg, or a few
just leave this running on it http://tinyurl.com/3lylvhl
Maybe just get a code phrase like "the narwhal bacons at midnight"?
About time I got solid rain here. So pleasant.

Hehe.
horned whales don't exist

WHAT
VGCATS UPDATED?
BLASPHEMY
This is madness!
lol just noticed it now
Torrenz..
this
that be FUNEH
how to make the bleep 3:
Sheep Sheep Sheep
did it bleep
this is giving me a wing boner
So pony fan code phrase?
yes, when you say someones name it bleeps
bleep
did it sheep
i get only beep when someone says beep Iks
Quit with the constant highlighting of a user's name
i think
Hot coffee can give you some pretty bad burns
XD
I know
it's so much fun
tell me about it
.-.
just like ponies
you need the caps
so Sheep
Torrenz
/me drinks his coffee black and is an impatient bastard
YEA
OMG you know what time it is?
oh wait, i'm thinking of flamethrowers
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
Ponies give you bad burns?
YES
/me wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<3
maybe ponies with flamethrowers do? i haven't checked
Too much clopping Nittany_Tiger
Then I have nothing to worry about.
Except flamethrowing poneis.
*ponies
yeah there has to be one pyromanic pony
bonus pints if a unicorn...
you know what else will be great about season 2
points
quick
someone make a fic about a pyromaniac pony
!
one week between each episode
/me is too sleepy
i'm betting someone already has
twenty billion videos, songs and what-have-you for each episode
/me but he has ideas
That'll be good spacing.
bonjour
i'm gonna go play some portal, ponies
I might go sleep
vous aimes les petites cheval
'night Dumori
maybe night Dumori
after I rewatch me some pony
still the EP is almost over
i'm pretty sure the plural of cheval is cheveaux
^ that
finally home
welcome home
welcome home
and see you guys in a bit, after i plow through portal for the 10th time
!s3
oh yeah, thanks :)
hehe I think I coudl sleep play portal now
hello
any way night guys
isn't cheveaux hair
Later
i think that's cheveux
there was some sort of difference there...
none other than the spelling, I bet
hmhm
French grammar is my bane
French never made sense to me
why learn a language that's as dead as Latin but a lot less badass
yeah, i know right?
most languages don't make much sense
i had to learn it from grade 4-8
grade 4-9, and another full three years in this other school I'm doing
4 years of my life, now that im out of highschool... looking back, that was a lot of time wasted
I grew up Italian/German, so no big loss
i should have kept to languages, i think
I feel sorry for the people that actually had to put up with it when they could've learned latin, italian or german
i usually did pretty okay there
...i don't know, what's so bad about french?
I'm biased, but it just feels redundant to me
countries that speak French: France
canada, too
yeah, but Canada has English
well, eastern canada
Im in west canada
no one speaks french
oh.
and then there's the immigrants, they all speak their own language
why teach French when you could teach English or Spanish, you know?
so i guess you could say there's some french out here
why not educate the idiots that can't tell the difference between 'their' and 'there'
and they're'
and they're
their not so bad
=________=
there are worse things
hue hue hue
i hope that was purposeful
yeah

oh god wat
Afternoon, fillies and gentlecolts
DerpyBot you troll.
Hola mis amigos.
Sounds like someone abused DerpyBot.
3 !moons = 5min ban
Ah.
sheep noooo
Sketchy~~~~~
Octavia, are you the Octavia I know?
So, I didn't gt that job I was hoping to get.
NO WORRIES SHEEP I'M COMING
!MOON
Grab my tail, Torrenz!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAA
sorry to hear that
it's just a regular kick
"Free shipping" "Shipping" "Ship whatever I want"
The person I know who goes by the name came up with it. :>
Torrenz, lern2read.
Oh dear.
3 !moons = 5 min ban.
I was referring to sheep
Lots, sure.
I believe her when she says that she did though.

Does the !moon thing ever reset over time?
jesus.
I just used !moon
^ my point
:P
and... i got a ban for like... 5 mins
that's there to keep the moon from getting overpopulated
Im gonna play Terraria
it wasnt doing that last night. xD
it could be a state of renegades
besides, imagine how tired derpy has to get, constantly flying people to the moon and back
there is an easy solution: do not type !moon
morning all
give the poor girl a break
morningg
Don't let Derpy send you to the moon, run away when she tries. :P
I !moon'd so I could be moon with you

whats your favorite game?
what kind of game?
my favorite game of all time?
hard to say
yesssss
like, PC/Xbox and stuff
I have different favorites for diferent genres
i think i'm gonna say...
I wish I had a blind bag Twilight Sparkle, I keep seeing huge spiders and would like to take a pic of them together
name them!
EarthBound
good choice
Mother 2
There's no pony "combo breaker" images out there?
My Twilight Sparkle blind bag has been all over the place with me.
To the top of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, and France.
D=
i've never heard of those places, except france.
I live in the center of Florida, she could go with be to the lake and to the swamp and to the cow pasture
what
Snowdon is the biggest mountain in Wales, Ben Nevis the biggest in Scottland and the UK.
Das Matterhorn
I want friday to be here
At leaste you've a something other than cow pasture.
Nooooo, DQ is so good ...
pff
i hate bloody
So much for that, then.
why does everything need to be violent?
not bloody as in blood, bloody as in 'gosh darn'
ill cut you
Jacky may or may not be british
Bloody is best expletive.
If you're British anyway.
I preffir "bugger"
Actually I'm just looking for alternatives to excessive curse word adjectives.
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
yus
/me wraps her front hooves around Sheep in a tight embrace
<3
how about "golly-gosh darned"?
oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh!
Because I didn't just watch a rabbit trip over a pillow.
Is 'damn' actually considered swearing the US then?
:( I just talked to a Russian girl...she told me she was going to commit suicide along with her boyfriend...I only managed to get out a plea for her to go on with life before she d/c'ed....
I've never been clear on that.
Yes
It's not rude at all in the UK.
yes, to pretentious adults
Yes. But it's one of the lighter curse words.
yes but it's a very light cuss
i dont think it is, it's personal preference
Bloody is pretty much considered a light swear.
Damn isn't anything here. XD
light curse, yes.
So bloody is a light curse in Britain, and damn is a light curse in the US.
Bloody doesn't mean a damn thing over here.
yes, pretty much

Ok.
For flapjack?
Thanks for caring so deeply Luna. (Sarcasm)
Pancakes, right?
No, not pancakes.
Lawl.
Waffles?
Why do you all think they are pancakes.
Nope.
Not waffles.
We call flapjacks flapjacks here in Britain as well.
We use flapjacks are synonym for pancakes here.
*as a
So what do you call flapjacks?
^what he said
flapjacks or pancakes. Waffles are different animal though.
flapjacks, here, are pancakes
Hot Cakes?
This is a flapjack.
but they are also refered to as flapjacks
what the hell is that.
A flapjack, lawl.
Poor.
That's a flapjack dude
Is that like a rice crispy treat or something?
It looks like cereal bars made into brownies.
Looks likea crumb cake of some kind.
You guys are missing out.
a brownie?
kind of looks like those rice cookies
Not a brownie.
and this is a pancake

mmm
I've been on the internet for too long to take anyone's suicidal remarks too seriously
now i want pancakes
I suppose they are kind of oat cakes that are stuck together with some kind of syrup or something.
!pancakes
Oh wow. You even have a cup of tea in the back there too.
It's a kind of baked good made with oats, cereal, syrup and a few other things.
Real mable syrup only please. Forget that HFCS stuff.
Ours are much flatter and bigger.
so like... a crepe?
Yes.
/me suddenly craves granola.
That's a pancake here.
We eat sausage wrapped in chocolate-chip pancakes on a stick here.
Well the thing was she said her boyfriend already did....
^lol
u jelly?
So do you actually have a word for pancakes, I'm confused.
Hey, guess what I've got Octavia? *munch munch*
For our pancakes.
...
GOD
Yes.
I just confused myself.
Pancakes are pancakes.
Do you have a word for our flapjacks.
Sheep, hm?
Is what I meant to say.
Cake.
(oatmeal)
We also call out pancakes "hot cakes".
Hm.
Strange.
I don't even know...

Hey everypony
helloo rainboom
What the hell?
I am polish and have had cabbage with vodka
It sounds like a nasty argument.
I was moving furniture around last night, heavy furniture...
"hunk of dough stuffs" seemed to work, though
Weird.
you're walked into a heated discussion.
they're good
Yeah, doughy bread things.
Hmm.
Interesting.
Ahahaha. Argy-bargy is such an English term.
Fireant: Sounds like some kind of strange sauerkraut.
Wait wasn't the guy who created Spiderses based off that word?
07Sorry Denied was not reading your notes... Just popping up out of no-where... What's with the suicidal people lately...
Like ArgemBargem
What do you call your soda?
Nope, it's a British word.

We have the Pop vs Soda wars here.
Under 10 days, whoo!
Pop where I am.
Some places call it pop, some places would call it fizzy drinks, some places just call it juice.
We don't have a word for soda in the UK.
Soda pop.
We just call them fizzy drinks.
It's funny when the south calls all sodas "Coke"
07Gotta make the best of it
07no matter what
We just ask for specific brands usually.
Same here...
Coke, sprite, lilt, pepsi, etc.
And yeah
Fanta! <3!
There's no general word for them other than fizzy drinks.
Wellp.
I broke that "Coke" habit. Now I say soda.
Well.*
Fassbrause!
I suppose there's also "carbonated drinks".
But no one says that.
True.
Do you know...
What an aubergine is?
Sounds like glue. I am terrible with British slang.
eggplant
Lol.
Yeah, LvS got it.
It's not slang.
They're just normal words here.
:P
Ahh.
Slang would be stuff like 'safe', 'hench', 'sick', etc.
But I'm not gunna confuse you guys further.
I'm home alone tonight, and someone else would probably go watch naughty stuff...
Sketchy_Sounds: I live in Reading.
But what do I do? Watch ponies...
I was just about to say, sounds like you're from somewhere near london
that's a good idea
more people should do that.
I just remembered. I dreamed last night I was chatting on EQD. That can't be healthy.

Scientist?

A hat?
LMAO
CogWeaver: Not here, different server.
No, Tavy. XD
oh okay
^.^
Gonna go have lunch. Be back in an hour or so.
Have you Luna decided what will be replacing IT Crowd?
WildPlastic: Yeah, original use was scientist.
okay, so what is a boffin?

yay stats!
Hmm
Stream tonight as usual?
I've been mentioned 4018 times
And Tavy was the last one to mention me.
Fitting ¦D
Moved one spot. yay
i mention you a lot.
Eeyup. XD
You do indeed
Can't stand jelly, I love jam, Jello is alright.
>Two words for jam
I was so confused.
XD
Likewise.
I was like
what is this
it is worse in latin spanish
Peanut butter jelly tiems? :3
I hate jello. Jam is good. Jelly is... I can't even remember the last time I had any.
jello is yummy, jiggly, and makes my mouth happy.
Acta est fabula, plaudite.
What I think is funny is how you need to be careful what word you use to say butter depending on your latin-based laguage audience.
Because burro is butter in Italian and donkey in Spanish, IIRC.
Considering I don't know anyone IRL here that understands it.
Jello feels like it's writhing in pain inside my mouth.
burro is also yummy food
That would just be mean
XD
Tea-leaf on the roof!
Did you ever read that book?
Jam is great because it's got little bits of real fruit inside. Jelly is just...sugar.
Nope.
It's a good book.
Applez.
Let's 'ave a butcher's!
I think some people like marmalade.
/me blankstares Sketchy_Sounds.
It's good, has oranges.
Omigosh Hi everypony!!!
Lolwut @ FIreant link
Octavia: butcher's = butcher's hook = look
there's pretty much nothing other than marmalade to get here
oh, that
Hello Self_in_socks!
i am framiliar with that
Where is it they only have marmalade, England?
LOL
lol wut
no, no, wait
People say 'burglarize' in the US?
i misunderstood something there.
I fold my socks into themselves after washing them, so my socks are in socks
Burglarize yes
i was talking about germany, since we call pretty much everything Marmelade
Hi, moony loony!
Fireant, best thing ever
Triximancer: In Britain we have marmalade but not exclusively.
That sounds like a made up word, "I've been BURGLARIZED!".
XD
but apparently that's NOT marmalade. it's jam/jelly.
It's not made up, it's a real word
Oh I know
See to us, burgled (sp?) would sound weird
Well, downright silly, actually
hide yo kids hide yo wives
mmm
/me hungry.
I thought marmalade was another term for butter.
/me looks to Sketchy_Sounds, "Feed me."
You mean margarine.
Or is that like margarine or something
Uh, no
And that's not butter.
Margarine is like, soy oil or something
It's awful
Margarine is orange, and it's something like 50% fat.
XD
Marmelade over here is pretty much everything that's made from fruit that you're supposed to spread on a slice of bread
then again, there's also konfitüre.
i don't even know where the difference is.
Sounds like the German version of "confit"
Do you guys ever use 'lush' the way we do over the pond?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confit
Nope.
Wow just realized.
!seen Revolver
Tiles: The last time I saw Revolver was Thu 01 Sep 2011 03:30:11 AM CEST
Lush as in drunk?
Damn I miss Revolver.
Sometimes it's used
well, that's not it
It's more of an old fashioned term though
lush forest
Marmelade and Konfitüre are pretty much the same thing, apparently
Sketchy_Sounds: Should get 'pomf' incorporated into British slang with a similar meaning to 'lush'.
That'd be awesome. XD
Oh, you don't know the meaning of the slang?
probably depends on where you are, since we have about 20 million dialects here.
I've heard it used like that...to men drunkard.
As in "That girl is lush".
Yeah means drunk
Oh, lol
probably more like 20
"I got a new job, the pay is lush"
I think that's more a southern specific thing, man
Ahh.
So it means "nice"?
You guys have a lot of squiffy slang after all
hmm we have lasch
which phonetically sounds the same
Still, incorporate 'pomf' into English slang, would be a win.
it really sucks when people do that, DeniedExistenceMobile, but yeah, chances are that it's just someone being a real jerk
*pomf* = wingboner
potzblitz.
What about 'hench' anyone understand that?
pomf = onomatopoeia right?
Eeyup.
Hench = never heard, except "henchman"
Sounds like "goon" or something. I see henchmen in it.
XD
*pomf* = What we're going to do on the bed
Wah~
pomf
bumsen?
07Yes
Oh good, TK421 went back to his post.
meh
ja
*Super-nerd*
07Entourage will replace the IT Crowd
Eh?
what's entourage?
07you'll see :)
i thought they say shaggin'
We do
Among other things
Hench means strong pretty much, strong as in muscular.
therefore henchmen
So, sort of "Larry is bear hench".
HBO show, 8 seasons, 95 episodes.

OH

I think so.
lol chavs... course they have
aha, well HBO shows tend to be pretty good
It's a joke in Florida.
They have them alright but they don't call them that so much
I vaguely remembered seeing commercials for it on TV.
Scene kids?
guidos?
I always hear chavs as being people in Florida.
Those would be pretty much analagous, yes
They always wear hoodies, talk almsot completely in slang.
anyone watching the Misfits tv series from the UK?
almost*
Should have gone with Burn Notice. :p Then we could all learn how to be super spies!
Wear jeans really low down.
Oh, yeah.
white trash?
Up here we call them neds.
Or actually trackies.
Oh. I was hoping for another comedy show... Never watched entourage tho, so this'll be interesting...
Chavs love their trackies.
Yep that's another term I know for them
Put pants into socks
Knackers.
twits?
Luna_In_Socks: that the Irish term for them?
Plus Burn Notice has Bruce Campbell
Cos if so that's pretty awesome
That, or "langers" if you're from Cork. Cork people are strange *giggle*
Ooh.
/me has a hard enough time maintaining three languages, the slang kills her.
Also <3 Fiona
/me hugs tavy
Why is it that HBO has no bad shows?
Ohai.
Burn notice would be me Dashite
Ooh, you speak three languages? Which ones?

Brilliant
Wow Cleverbot said that extact thing to me yesterday.
So fitting

that is one of my favorite words
Cap UNDER hoodie.
I thought you were going to say something else, Dari. Something naughty.
Nike hoodie.

Genius.
Luna_In_Socks: Me? Naughty? :>
There is a lot of win in that image
I would chalk it up to preffrence, I did not care for some of those.
That's my favorite HBO show lineup.

This one dude asked me if I wanted to "roleplay"
"That's puir magick ba the wey!"

/me loves roleplaying
One of the voice clips from the Angry Scots voice set of the Worms games.
Tell em sure, just let you get your wizzard cape and hat.

What kind of roleplay?
Dammit Sumica, beat me to it.

Uh, not spelled phonetically it's "That's pure magic by the way!"
lolol

Right. Clothing, food, stream.
Chrono Ivan. :D
8Haha, that's what it feels like anyway. I woke up sick in real life though. e_e;
All at the same time.
yeah but he was NOD AI
*it was
ALL The things.
Find a hot spot!
13Thats what I mean
6Tesla troopers. . .
It will be a silent spring.
13Everyone is sick IRL
Oh! I'm glad I have the Hub on my TV then... >_> Not to mention it will be on a hi-def 3D TV that my dad just barely bought...
Sketchy_Sounds: can you wait six hours? :P
8It's that time of year.
Yuri was also really Awesome in Red Alert 2
Actually seven because I don't get home until about 8
8-nods to herself- Yup.
Psychic Ready
6Whenever I go to see my sister in France and we go to downtown Paris and see the Eiffel tower, I always think
6GIANT TESLA COIL D:
/me 13pulls back to blinds and looks outside, eyes narrowing
haha
:D
13Quite possibly..
/me laughs.
Ah Cosmonauts.
No, but I could maybe do another one then.
Tesla Coil is one of the awesomest weapons in videogame history
:D
Well, up to you
8It's just known to be that time of year anyway... ugh... -rubs her head-
6That's very nice Fluttershy! I get to watch it on my monitor or my tiny tv. I do not have much money enough to pay for big one.
/me claps her socked hooves
Another stream tonight??
What do you stream?
Suppose you did't see the real giant coil he buil eh VioletVanilla
It's just that because of the time zones you're always playing when I'm at work
My dad likes to spoil himself. =_=;
What's being streamed?
We don't get the Hub in Canada. :/
:P
13I think I usually get sick to
13I just havent yet
Mooooosic?
/me Glombs VioletVanilla & Fluttershy
6@Dashite: The only issues was Cosmonauts were you only used for one mission.
I know, stream yourself singing for us.
:P
But at least he shares. I know there's a way to connect the TV to my laptop too. Maybe I could find some way to stream it online too?
/me ish glomp'd by Luna <3
8I get sick about every 2 months actually =_=
I can't wait! Well, I will wait for you to do the "clothing" bit, anyway.
Spamming cosmonauts on that one mission was fun though.
/me blushes
/me is glomped as well, blinks. "Oh, hi Luna..!"
/me laughs
8I don't have a very good immune system u_u

Iron stomach.
07Oh hi!

I'm going to try singing Chì Mi Na Mòrbheanna this time. Should be fun.
@Dashite what kind of Yuri...? o_O

/me doesn't know that one.
8bronitis?
Not me!
You wouldn't, it's Scots Gaelic
i love that language
No, no, no I wont show it. >_<;
13Something like that
I don't think there's an Irish version. But maybe I'll recognise it.
I mean... ah... -squeaks-
8bronyitis hehe
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chì_mi_na_mòrbheanna
07^

UTFail.
Interesting how the actor of Kane has not really done anything besides being Kane in C&C
lolz
-hangs her head- mm... dang it can't think my head's all stuffed up...
Maybe do it without the fadas....
6Okay. . . Who has C&C?
07I do
/me wishes she could help Fluttershy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_mi_na_morbheanna
6Please get better soon. . .
the first one?
6LUNA YOU HAVE?!
07oui zat is correct Madame
6o.o
I believe you can download all old C&C games leagally for free.
/me does a happy dance
07you sure?
C&C1 and Red Alert 1 were released free I believe.
I think they released them as freeware not long ago
6What about newer ones?
I think I have cold medicine somewhere... >_<;
The newer ones are still being sold.
/me hands Fluttershy cough drops
07there you go
Try Ziacam if you have that where you live Fluttershy. It works wonders.
6I know, but who has newer?
Even Red Alert 2?
6I have all.
Thank you, Luna. And Ziacam...? o-o Never heard of it...
6I have looked for small group to stomp comps
I wish I did have some cough drops irl, sigh... but I know I do have cold medicine somewhere thank goodness... u_u; It's that time of year, pretty sure...
Just ran a program that replaced 24 files of important data with junk XD
6Poor dear. . . Go take some then Fluttershy c:
... Somepony has to get her some cough drops! D=
SHould be live in about 20-30 minutes
Apparently they were giving away Tiberian Sun as well.
-salutes- Will do VioletVanilla
It more or less makes you not feel sick for 4hours.
I have RA2&Yuri C&CTiberian Sun &Firestorm and Generals&Zero Hour
@Sumica: Interesting... o-o where do you live?
US, las vegas area
07I have the first decade set
oro?
oooh, okay. I'm in the US in Utah, so it's probably somewhere
6Good .. . Good. . . .
Lost connection =(
Manly men from manly mountains maintain mediochre medicine

Okay good, my m key is working again
/me calls the exterminator
lol
/me hugs Pinkie_Pie
/me turns to stone
:o
/me loves that song.
September 17th is sooo close D:
My body is not ready x.x
/me pets the stoned Pinkie_Pie
... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfslY_AvhLw
Less than 10 days away
Someone please whip me into shape D:
that's too bad, Molestia does not care if it is ready
D:
incidentally, my body is the only part of me that is ready
"Stoned Pinkie_Pie"
Wat
just be glad it's not a gender swap episode like Adventure Time is having
Oh god.
x.x
The closer the day gets, the more unready my body becomes.
07Everypony stream will go live in +- 1 hr from now on
and monism would argue that there isn't even a part of you that is not your body
then you body REALLY wouldn't be ready
so okay.
Sweet!
My body would implode.
plus or minus one hour?
i saw that episode, it was pretty okay
oh wait no / in ther
07t-minus :P
Hm...?
6I took as approximate
oh that makes more sense
^
Dammit Dumica!
Sumica >_>
How dare you. =p
6Which C&C should we play if we all did?
Ooh, I thought it would be out later tonight
i'm going full cupcakes in p-1 pony
/me watching Girly Adventurers
i already saw it the day before yesterday
/me did not play C&C at all
I'm confused... o-o;
/me Luna's bf did though
they're always out on mondays, right...?
I say we should play tf2 instead =p
Right, all C&C's are fine by me
Luna Luna, that's twice the Luna I'm used to
6Would you want to play though Luna?
C&C Renegade!
:D
07sure
oh not that one
CMC renegades?
;_;
6Disregard rubbish TF2, Command and Conquer
You forgot to shout YAY at the end of that RobotPinkie
Most time I've clocked with RA2, and least Tiberian Sun/Firestorm
if it had been a statement, then sure :P
But i dont have C&C save for the psx versions.
=_=; I have no idea what's going on... I'm girl irl so... yeah. >_>;
07<< is a girl too
6<< is a girl as well
OMG A GURL! ^_^
07rofl
Being a girl seems no longer as valid excuse.
Three of them!
-blinks- Yay. :3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geXVKtqOnmU
though I've been on here already under a different name... >_> ]
Which is?
Guess. ;3
07RBD?
Dammit RBD!
-blinks- No... o-o
Luna, RBD was me
I was here yesterday.
I know what her other name is, but its your job to guess
07Hmm
I wonder if Pinkamena Diane Pie will show up again.
Fluttershy is totally Sathi
07We had a Fluttershy in here yesterday..
/me laughs
I hope not.
PinkiusPiacus?
welp I must be going
07Nah that was our live Pinkie
g'bye
Dammit GGgala! You creating more alts again?!
Was it bob? it was bob wasn't it!
If flipping out like that is a real part of Pinkie's personality, then the other ponies will always have to be really careful around her and that'll change everything.
you know, there is one thing i'd REALLY like to see, maybe even above everything else
I wonder if she'll do more live stuff? I'd like to hear live reading with Pinkie voice
/me puts on her best Trollface
It would make for good character developmen.
can't think of whoever else was here yesterday but isn't now...
and that would be Rarity having an evil twin sister
named Vanity
@RobotPinkie -thumbs up- I do Fluttershy voice too :P
oh i was right? awesome
Cause that's what you have to do with people who are both Sckitsoprhinic and bipolar
I have no idea how to spell that word. = 3=
schizophrenic
/me hugs Fluttershy
Thank you.
Yup... o-o Wow... awkward silence...
Yes Robot, you won the game
Fluttershy=PinkiusPiacus?
well, i hope i got that right...
Pinkie pie is both Bipolar and a schizo.
^agreed.
Yes WhatPayne
It would only make sense that they'd have to be careful around her. :o
07omg
/me takes notes
Yup... ^^
07Me
Oh btw Luna it was totally Mirc being stupid, tried a different program and never dropped.
pinkie is on a far higher evolutionary level than everypony else
OMG! DARI OUTTAK FUKKEN NOWHERE
07Sumica Mirc is up here all the time
Hi Dari, and I am.
Oh awesome... (FYI I liked more of the PinkiusPiacus name, it had personae)
because of that, "sanity" means something different for her
#binddaas
join
She assumed that her friends didn't like her and went into a mental meltdown.
Do you know...
I like doing... doing... imitation? Or whatever you call it?
What a flapjack is?
I was refering to it droping me all the time.
Yeah, a pancake basically
LOL NO
Right
pancakes
L
Firing up the stream engine
@WhatPayne I like my PinkiusPiacus name too, but I wanted to keep Fluttershy's name traditional. Her name is perfect as is. ^^
no
NOOOOOOO
so to speak
LOOOOOOOOOOl
D:
She showed anger issues...intense anger issues o.O
So wrong. :P
I was just about to watch Wicker Man.
That's because they are Dari...
DONT YOU BE TROLLIN MRME DARI!!!
They aren't.
Cat
Cat :@
Yes, yes they are.
Fluttershy:That it is.
Cat :@ Join #binddaas
No, they aren't.
Like when she interagated Spike.
:X
I'll get you a pic of a pancake.
Tgey
Oh dear... ^^;
No, they aren't.
Tgey!
Just because you have something else you call a flapjack doesn't mean it doesn't mean pancake over here.
nope
You guys have no word for flapjack.
or did you want the "sweet oat bar" annswere
Fcuk
:X
