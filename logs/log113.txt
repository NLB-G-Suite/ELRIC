The links on the front page of EQD work fine, they're 1080
720P is fine by me lol
07Lurkmode offline
It's just that YouTube's flagging system is easily exploitable

07ohai
/me meows at Luna
/me meows back softly

07Have some Celestia http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/248/8/9/princess_celestia_by_14_bis-d490h6a.jpg
omaigawd thank you Cesco
Dude! That uploader made my favorite joke about spring!
We having again a stream tonight?
My current computer is about the same as when I bought it 3 years ago now.
07Maybeeee
Wasn't the P4 a direct descendant of the 386 anyway too?
benjamin?
That's a horrible name dude
CC = Closed Captions available, Y = Youth (TV-rating)
best name ever
That looks nice
DeMagickxz - all the episodes are listed in a scroll bar to the right under "youtube streams"
nice and convenient
Hmm
Mkay

07Have some crazy me

07http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lr0nv6hQ1D1qbe7gjo1_500.png
FckShtStack: who's Benjamin? Besides my RL name?
They are on my computer D_D
I'm curious
when is the stream starting again?
i like that pic
Pony downloads, was updated regularly durring season 1 -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vEUmE4WgUjXhXT8elNTkvt6JpHUTm4-bFXvmhPoQNI/edit?hl=en&authkey=CKuAhdcF
Me too
360p - Mono
but they use aac encoding
at least for the 480 and up
It was awesome.
071:15 hr
And took ages to buffer. T_T
See, I always wondered about the audio encoding
No
are there any sneak peaks of season 2?
Not 1440x900
I think I can watch more house today, I'll leave early!
About 2460x1440
That'd be 2460x1440
Yeah
DEMAGICKSXZ
oh cool
Hope I can home in time for house
That was just an estimate
Err
I can't believe I got it right
xDD
Thanks
ok
Is linking to torrent sites allowed?
Umm.,,
Should be
I can't pick a favorite pony it's too hard
yeah
but I'm leaning currently towards Rainbow Dash
Lol
Fluttershy is awesomely cute
linking to pirated material? we're becoming a normal IRC channel
i would never like to pick
its to tough
Gah
I like Applejack too
Agreed.
they're all awesome
^
I mean I think of how generally awesome RD is
Then how cute RS is
Dash is a show off @_@
It's just too much to choose from.
Dash deserves to show off.
xD
All the other showoffs are assholes.
No, she's an asshole too.
Trixie is an asshole but a loveable one
Suppose I could link the torrent file itself.
Lol
I marked it on my calender.
is that the one with the owl?
if its not on EqD it shouldnt be read
I prefer to stay away from pony fanfics
DerpyBot has a Season 2 countdown.
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:10m:51s
no that's "owl's well that ends well"
:D
Brb, marking Beatles calendar
was it app proved?
idk
Ahh!
Right
philomena or something?
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:18h:09m:56s
Yes
I don't actually know which I'm more exited for
1.8/1.9 or Season 2...
I think Season 2.
Damnit
I only have purple markers
1.8/1.9?
Eh I can just link torrent file to unbranded 720p ponies in PM if anyone wants. D_D
Oh wait here's a yellow one
Win

Fireant jesli jestes online, odpisz - pilna sprawa techniczna

or pinkiepiese
Hello.
/me rozumia wszystko.
Nah, I was trying to say 'this is as good as a Pinkie Pie party' in Magickese
Hellew
lol
"dunka dunka"
Michael89pl, rozumiem że kod potwierdzający rejestracje ci nie przyszedł na maila, tak?
The only Magickese words I know are Krief and Dunka Dunka
Dunka Dunka is 'party'
рривет, тварешы!
Its not
Muhhumud Jihad.
xD
had to reload the page, i guess i missed a lot
ALLAH
Which is why when I speak magickese itrs just gibberish
Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a terrorist pony.
/me eyes DerpyBot and Coz.
Soundwave: LOL
?
Ve Spetzen de Havindir. Ve Spetzen de KRIEG
Oh, Freeze was just saying that he has an audition for a play soon
/me can't wait
they're going up way too fast
I may have found a friend with the hub
Fireant przejdzmy na kanal #Poczekalnia
Ooh ooh I know this one

They won't.
"Fireant join the channel #polishponies"?

Yeah, beyond me. Sorry.
mmmmmmh

that's pretty awesome by itself already
Lol
Probably.
haha
Make Applejack punch trees.
xD
^Nice name
lols
/me calls THISISWHINING a mule.
i'm pretty sure you can interprete just about anything as a reference to anything you want
you know, if you really, really try
Huh?
The color of these buttons...
It's alike that or Rainbow Dash
Of*
IT MUST BE A REFERENCE TO RAINBOW DASH HURR
"Well, I'll tell him, but I don't sink he'll be very keen. He'z already got one, you see!"
"What?!"
*sotto* "they said theyve already got one!"
Lol
I can walk on humans
^Ikr
xD
nice somponeyelse, I missed that minute ago
Naturally.
Afternoon everypony
"
I didn't see any scootabuse in Season 1
i just think it makes Dash seem a bit too cruel and uncaring
Grrrr I dun WANNA go to skuul..
You should.
BUT I DUNT WANNAAA. (THIS is whining)
not literal physical abuse, Barry :P
And some other words...
skuuuull.
I didn't even see any emotional or verbal abuse
Zuul!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V7zbWNznbs
School.
Umad?
no
zuul lol... i was thinking the same
/me tips Soundwave over
Let's take Owl's Well that Ends Well
All that's there is a fangirl willing to do anything for her idol, and Dash obliging her
No need to make this a grand debate, jeez
Trolls have crappy level adjustment ;P
Must be some weird add-on.
/me flails wildly and crashes to the ground
my brains feel like raw gibblets mixed in jello floating in a pool of conjealed gravy
sure, why not
NO! I'm not cat food!
I'm just saying
/me scampers away
talking about cat food... anyone seen the movie District 9?
/me gallops into the distance. "YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIIIIVE!"
/me scratches his name. "Weird pony..."
hey hey
ho ho
/me grinds to a halt. "I'm not weird, I'm just sensitive."
There's a ton of Scootabuse fanart tho... I've never really liked that phenomenon as much
lol thanks for the strawman
Exactly, it's all in fanart
hmm but not the correct spelling of some of the words
^
but there's just as much scootalove, if not more now, than scootabuse
poor Soundwave
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZwuTo7zKM8
Dangit
Another week of wait for the grand finale now
She wasn't, was she?
/me waves a greeting
Hello
it must have been an addition done by a different writer, if she was
I'm not going to read through 50 different endings to it to confirm
:/
having a good day?
Yes
YES
I returned.
omg, yes...
I know that one
To LASH my fury upon thee!
/me lash his fury.
/me lash to the right.
no...
I'm indifferent about the whole thing
/me cries
/me stands up panting. "What the hell...?"
/me lash to the left.
Aww....
Sorry Jadenii
its fine
V.V
I'd like to be, but there's just something about that
neither is fanart
and there's nothing in canon to support it
lol no shit?
the show's rated TV-Y, for crying out loud
/me limps back to join the herd. "That really hurt..."
http://ask-twilightsparkle.tumblr.com/post/9685158365/this-is-part-1-here-is-part-2
I have a feeling I'm missing something here...
/me displays a shockingly sad face.
probably not much.
/me gasps. "I appreciate them all!"
lol
Probably, but still something.
Yep
well, we're all doing our best, and that should be enough
it isn't, of course, but still.
haha
>_>
/me Declares loudly, "I'M GONNA DO AN INTERNET!"
Rainbow has to cut herself free or something
Part two is inception.
I missed a poll. XD
Oh well, the one I would have voted for won anyway.
asdfmovie4?
Good.
More people need to see it.
as did I
:D
I watched it all of 6 times
I still liked asdf2
same
/me "I wanna go to the moon."
*sigh*
"I baked you a pie!
I LIKE TRAINS.
First day of school
Over
>_>
/me "WHY WAIT!?"
xD
Finally
11
I don't think it would be any good if they made it for adults, really.
TomSka and me are good friends I like to think. xD
x3
or even teens
I like trains.
My friend wore a Pinkie Pie shirt today
man, first day of school. gives you something to look forward to.
trains are nice
Ok then
Oh the things. All the things!
oh no pidgeons
Soundwave... whY?
*threw
KShrike I have no idea...
:(
exactly, they were subtle enough to go over little kids' heads
Ugh, my spelling's horid today
Yeah,I wore a zebra hoodie backpack
Yeah, but a lot of kids shows do that
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
its a hoodie and backpack in one
WHYYYYYY
:3
look at rugrats
Whatever that is, it's most likely something I don't want to see... D_D
KShrike: one dude on devart is doing a comic :P
Soundwave, we don't talk about that
mhm, yes. it is.
it's full of it
ly
That awkward naked episode?
it's just a bunch of words.
ever
its stupid, disgusting and shouldnt be mentioned
:P
Xiagu if they're too young to read it they're too young to be here.
not ture
*true
its PG
I am 12
Soundwave, you're looking for #EquestriaAfterDark
and i am here
Lol
>:(
fantastic age
Is anyone there? o.O
xD
*tap *tap is this thing on?
Soundwave, 61 ponies right now
I loved being 12
:P
i missed out on being 12
and became scarred
Aww...
:3
lol
same.
"dark" is okay with kids shows though, as long as it's mostly implied
and pretty much every other age, too.
Barry: Read from where?
:D
we're debating fim's s2 rating
remember when joining EquestriaAfterDark..... things cannot be unseen
:(
eqd
Hmm
exactly, Iks
somewhere there
>.<
To be honest.....
I missed school today
asdasasefasd: not good
go to scool
They posted abuut that?
Not good at all.
if you don't
appreciate school
Still
oh
you won't be able to talk with us
awwwwwww
*o
at least it gives you a place you can go to
the synopsis was leaked
Why won't I be able to talk with you?
Kooky
It's only one day...
My alarm didn't go off.
oh noes
I really hope they do more with Pinkamena though
D:
and that's all i'm saying
I dont need an alarm
I use my phone as an alarm
And I put it on snooze
Then it fell under me >_>
xd
Thanks Barry, because that's all I know of S2 <3
Well
It wakes you up
Does it not?
Oh wait? FIM season 2 rating?
Barry: Oh?
to the fans, anyway
Yeah I guess...
Still, its objective is to wake you up
oh hey
yes, i know.
/me giggles
Anything below TV-MA is no watch... Thank you very much.
Huh, never actually knew that
/me hugs SummerRain
/me :3
My alarm seems to screw me over some times
I'm leaving now
not... much?
I need to eat >_>
*sarcasm
lol
>_>
TO THE KITCHEN
But I remember freshman year when I had a 7:40.... yuck
goodbye odd combonations of letters
/me reads his physics book
ghjguyuyuk
hiya....
/me reads his calculus book
when i was in school, i got up around 6:00 most of the time
that was great
calculus in 3 dimmensions
:P
you had to wake up at 7:40 AM?
._.
/me drops the bass..
EPIC DINOSAUR LASER BATTLE
She just uses parties as a cover for her real self
>.<
:(
You aren't thinking very hard.
same same
lol
that's awesome
what's this about everything being bold in this channel, now?
(well c'mon.. i wasnt supposed to)
:P
xD
/me bounces joyfully around the room
That reminds me. . .
i like to have my time eaten
/me smiles and continues
daww
/me maliciously trips Soundwave up
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:17h:03m:44s
WOOT!
play nice
:(
Season 2!!!!1
I dunno, I don't think it's a cover she uses, it's genuinely her special talent to lift the spirits of others
:(
/me yelps and crashes into the ground. "GAH!"
I hate waiting
/me whistles nonchalantly
that should be a poll
KShrike, you forgot earth pony
G2g.
definately
i'mma earth poneh
HMmmmm
or some kind of magic
I prefer pegasi myself, but if I had to pick a tank, I would go earth pony all the way
^^^^
Bottle on vicodin
I'm thinking it would look like a piece of a puzzle.
*of
KShrike, because the other two kinds aren't as strong as earth ponies?
Unicorns>EveryPony
nuff said
lol chomping down on vicodin being a special talent? :P
They have an entire city to themselves
i wish i could be like that
Earthponies best ponies.
NO
They don't need horns/wings to be awesome.
If you survive, then yes
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
They do it all themselves. >:3
I'll assume earth ponies are faster and stronger
Excuseeee me?
She's sort of an outlier.
but... they don't have as much fun.
If Ponies were rpg classes for me it'd be
also, earth ponies are stronger
/me soars through the air, backflipping and such
>:3
Earth = High in defense
Unicorn would be magical
AlwaysSunny, I disagree
I'm sure Earth Ponies and Unicorn Ponies have their own cities...
I would probably be a unicorn, if given choice.
KShrike: my thoughts exactly
^this
wait, really?
(Nashy) Kind of like RPG archetypes, Warriors are strongest and toughest, Rogue/Archer types are agile and fast and spellcasters have OMGMAJICKS.
D_D
my special talent would be arguing about ponies online...
Being able to pick a pony type with its own perks
I keep coming back to that line.
But none of them involving ponies
wow
AlwaysSunny, I would give Earth ponies high Atk/Def, for melee. Pegasi get high speed / agility or whatever, and are very accurate and have multi hit weak attacks or crits, depending on system.
:P
but
KShrike, you hating?
Nah
KShrike, also wait, what's wrong?
:3
Like pegasi being able to go to clouds dale, Unicorns donig magic and earth ponies....Probably quicker with physical work or something
It blew my mind when I noticed that Pinkie Pie actually looses some colour when she got depressed
i'mma EP
could be*
but
i shouldnt be
!link word_of_faust magic
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/8275
KShrike, well I mean if you actually disagreed at all I'd like to hear it
my hands are cold, i can't type well
it happens
/me backflips through the air and swirls and twirls
:3
OWNED
!flip
DAT LUNA
/me claps
That's cliche
IS SCHOO CUTE
Yeah but I mean for Pinkie, her own birthday should be something very special, I thought...
she never celebrated it before, either
lol thought until I saw that episode anyway
I bet
Does anyone really forget their own birthday IRL?
no, but they forget their girlfriend's birthday all the time!
/me desperately searches around for an insulin shot
or boyfriend's
bah
Pony desktop sprites
get in the way!
Actually it looks like parties were the last thing to cross their minds
or would it feel like a normal day
She can't really fly though.
Fluttershy has her own personalities though
I care for animals too
:O
ahahah
Nashy: yes she is
Xiagu: I did a long time ago. Nopony listened
LOOOOOOOOONG time
Rarity's special talent isn't gem finding though
it's design
Hi E_N
!!!!
Rarity's special talent is working with gems. Finding, using, everything.
RARITY IS AMAZING
Hypocrit
They be fashionable!
Then why were they ferrying the rocks back and forth?
^
i like rarity a lot
she's a drama queen ;_;
The problem I have with Rarity.... goodness, she is basically justifying bedazzling everything!!!! AHH! IT BURNS!!!!!!
Rarity uses people.
Raritree.
Whines.
Probably to try to make geodes
lol not sure Pinkie's tale is necessarily entirely truthful
Nashy: How?
I think it's more the gems inside geodes than it is the racks themselves
rocks*
She uses Spike mostly.
yeah
!
Why does spike have to do everything?
she knows he loves her
I like Rarity...

FluffyWuffs: Spike isn't a pony
:(
./cs SOP #Bunker ADD E_N
ssoooo yeah
Meh
It's pretty much like owner
Thanks for reminding me :P
:D
i listen to it all the time, mostly on repeat
<.<
Dig up all these gems, I'll give you ONE of them.
and now Pinkie's wife can't stand the sight of her :(
its already practically burned into my brain
Yeah, agree
INCONSISTENCY!
Wedding?
uhhhhh
I can't listen to it too often, because when I listen to it I stop doing everything else
I am disappoint
Ok?
strange to get married at age 12
yesh xD
lol, its rp
:D
WHY
KShrike there are tons and tons of inconsistencies
I know right tho?
Wat
I'm just saying
me too
lol
its amazing how often applejack loses her freckles
haha
Rarity and Fluttershy are my favourite
Iks, *1-up noise*
yep
I don't want to watch that.
Well maybe Pinkie had a really awesome time growing up, with tons of parties
Well, at least the majority of these inconsistencies are only little slip ups
Then you start noticing those things.
And they annoy you.
as opposed to minor things
i know, but i'm talking about weddings now
Pretty entertaining
lol
...hmmm, nah, I think it's more likely that she invented parties
oh, mkay
never been to one
>.<
Hey, I saw the script for Season 2 E1 Act three
Seriously. I clicked on Fluttershy's song (Hush Now, Quiet Now) and it crashed
I think Pinkie invented fun parties
No
zing
You're not my mommy!

There are 2 other dragons.
I'm going AFK for a while, gotta eat
I haven't hugged Luna today yet!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-HCk6emBg&feature=related
Okay
Maybe one is Spike's mommy?
/me hugs Luna
Hi, Luna
/me hugs Luna
I'd hate it if Spike met his parents in season 2
They're dragons.
yeah
Huge dragons.
07A wild stream appeared
Voice, Lack of eyelashes
They may as well be female.
I would face my fears, but it costs 50 dollars. (Dead Island) XD
the blue/green one also lacks eyelashes
could be Nashy, could be...
That would be rich if it was the real Fluttershy singing that, considering she didn't face her fear of dragons until her friends were troubled
ROFL oh you :3
JadeniisENGAGED well that is because they are totally brainraped by the medie, society and the chemicals in the food
*media
oh and the school system
and watches porn
(wth???)
Jad, EAD
Spike could have recessive genes too
I sense hypocrisy.
does she kill people?
I know, but we were born straight.
No.
Yes, read the bible.
lol bible
/me ate his bible
the bible is pretty old
i think
My #1 source for information on everything... Or not.
pretty old? Try centuries
i dont know you after all
Interesting
and to this day, 'people' are still editing the bible
lol
oh, come on, no religious discussions please
these things never end well...
i AM NOT
doesn't matter anyway
/me shrugs
Prejudice has no place here.
KershaFangs: I still say that
let's just agree on the following:
we are all wrong
all the time
but, seriously.
the end.
hm?
Yet
no, not the end.
/me doesn't want to have this whole religion topic in this channel
please
its my religion...
I don't have anything against religious people, but when they wave it in my face..
I mean, I am stopping now, but...
look, it's okay that you're religious
I don't believe that.
^
^this
it's just we don't want to talk about religion
really.
I'm feeling a bit conflicted. I know I'm supposed to be loving and tolerance of people, but some of them just make it hard
^^^^^above that
Yeah, I stopped.
okay.
Embrace the power......OF RELGION!
but, yeah
i don't think you have to tolerate everyone...

Anyone can explain why Ponies are at the top of Memebase?

Because Ponies.

I like both

Look in my hand, two tickets to that thing you enjoy. Look again, the tickets are now PONIES.

Nice. XD

good lord!
lol, I loved ME
and 98
GGGala
I never used 2000 D:
we went from 3.1 to 95, which we used for years
and then xp.
This one?
My first was 95
3.1 was DOS
yeah, this one. well BS is also slow.
if you talk OS
Are we talking about computers now?
welll... yes
07he's not here I think
but I never used it all that much
Darn
ME was horrible and i avoided 2000 cause I knew from experience at work that it was horrible
i just kind of watched and didn't understand a thing
My first OS was 95
Whee, now I have a brushable Pinkie Pie
ME wasn't that bad
I loved it more than XP
shush FluffyWuffs
XD
07She joined the crew last weekend
you are a computer noob
07;-)
back when I were younger*
oh boy, IT crowd
Oh, I thought I was crazy not noticing that sooner...
Well, this one is notorious for being slow before the evening.
The only one I skipped was ME after that.
And then that horrid OS
vista...
Oh, before I forget
/me hugs Luna
07Nah she needs to be added to the about page
I had to stick with XP for another 2 years
Turn off
Turn on
Alwasy works
i've seen vista ruin a lot of things
My old machine still runs 98 SE
i'm glad i never had to use it for anything
Well... "runs" might not be the right word
Oh goodie stream is up
i can do it
power off
power on
Meh. I never had any problems with vista
oh, yeah. shouldn't be too much longer.
And that too, I tried to search, but did not find her name
Shadowmane...?
even booting up the dang thing
i'd go to university, someone had prepared a presentation
6Thank you both very much! :3 I do need to be added to that. . .
using vista.
it would NEVER work.
oh wait, we're missing somebody.
You remind me of another younger bloke...
^lol
ShadowMane's here
Lol
I hear that quite often. Probably my boy
No browser!?
aha
well, use whatever works for you
640k is alright
i am using XP for 10 years now
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
It downloads fast than 640 Kilobytes?
i have about 300 kbps, i'd never need more than that
/me FluffyWuffs|brb
I get about 3mbps
ffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I have to go
Whorses
The scary thing is, someone, somewhere, has said that...
But that amounts to DL speed of about 600 Kilobytes.
:o
waaat
I am scandalized, asdasasefasd
mines okay
come to think of it, i'm never quite sure of it, either
but it screws up
A LOT
i don't really care, anyway
I also rarely have problems with my router...
Hi there! :D

(Not that Equestria can handle more than one of us)
i couldn't even beat my printer
-laughs, bounces in a cirlce-

9Awesome, thanks. Now I have to think of a good one since you have Dash ; )
awkward
!link Sports
inafter No objection jokes
lol
dat hair
well, she has a book on running
It's not set as public.
Maybe she borrowed it?
lol
Just like epic-chat doesn't appear on the list.
goth/death metal being gloomy?
11Yes it does
cant explain that
You have to click the option to type in the server manually.
11What?
Hai guise.
Pinkie was right. Twilight does need to get out more.
but you think irc.ponyirc.com can?
A lot more
Not where we're going.
Where we're going doesn't exist yet. ;)
um... probably..
ahh. heh.
Hello, Shamrock.
Nice try deducing it though. :P
now shes a lifeguard in Dubai XD
OH SHI-
okay?
You got a point there
/me points to self
11I'm looking at it under browse networks
right?
...
Epic-chat isn't, I just checked.
6So far there's four that I know of including me
Octavia's cool, because I get to call her Škoda
Oh yeah
why?
6Female bronies/pegasisses~
I have a feeling you are not paying attention.
IRL?
6jaja :3
oh, right.
...
wat, ther are female broni- uh ponies?
11http://i.imgur.com/KOk5M.png
11If I scroll up, there's no bronystat
The SG1 is the protagonist team in the Stargate SG1 series
Although, she is actually probably good at math.
you mean bronyserv?
0?
Otherwise she couldn't really run an apple stand
I was actually saddened when none of my cousins recognized my Luna shirt
Wait wut...
6O: You have a Luna shirt?? <33
11Not there either
Did someone kick me out?
There's Easychat, Echo34, ECNet, EFNET, EpiKnet, Esper, euIRC, Europa-IRC, EuropeIRC, EuropNet, Evility, and ext3.
cool
That's everything in the list.
Yeah, made it myself
lolwat?
Thanks for reminding me ive been meaning to order a shirt
6I need to make one. . .
6Dashite!!!!! <3
/me ponypounces Dahite
Don't need to be good at math to run an apple stand.
MFW you're looking at the wrong thing.
i'm on a diet
Augh! Got me again!@
She can't fly, LvS.
:P
11...
well, she could. she just doesn't want to.
wait whats happening?
Can she shoot laser beams from her eyes?
same
You're on the wrong thing, as I said.
Hi
Twilight can!
IRC isn't listed in their networks for connecting.
dat background
And can beat the others in a race.

epic-chat*
That voice...
6Suddenly Sathi~
07no no it's not me
Being a unicorn who's talent is just "magic" is hax.
Remember she can do anything
gar
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNEXJQkZpn0
07indeed
being in two places at once
Derpy could beat her by preemptively dropping an anvil on her head. :P
Whats next?
it's a livestream within a stream?!
CUTE
07dat giggle :)
Hey settle down now
um...
Twilight shrugs off blunt force trauma
Streamception
i have no idea...
You're the Pinkiest Pie I know
amg
Only weakness: snakes
Why did it have to be snakes?
Let's hear some Pinkie Pie then...
Fluttershy could summon a horde of snakes and defeat her
Is she...
She is..
I told you, you need to type in the network manually for mibbit.
RPS with ponies.
As you have to for epic-chat.
What's going on?
/me giggles
07A Lunar streamception
no thanks, I'm not a singer
Stream within stream?
07oui
Just click "server
"
We must go deeper?
Stream within a stream within a stream, actually
It's because it's not set as a public server.
Chatception
Just as epic-chat isn't.
6Oui zat is correct madame~
Whoa
ninja'd pinkie
07you did great ;)
/me bursts into flames
0Nice voice~
/me huggles Cat and shares his flames
/me dies
You're watching a stream watching a stream of yourself watching yourself.
I can hear you just fine
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/3971
Suddenly: dari
How do you make Derpy comment on links?
My mind is blown
/me lurks
Oh she's just slow
yes we can hear you just fine
Hey there everyone.

Who's streaming?
Could you repeat that? :p
whoa, speed talk?
Kill yourself? Y/N
6The above responses are the male fans X3
*choke*
i still don't get what's going on...
NO! Dont do that D=
Press any key.
A
Wut?
Are you sure?
Y
As if she could
FFFFFUUUUU
who's talking?
Ok, yeah, I can definitely hear the Pinkie within
I know.
You are eaten by a grue.
Hi.
Would you like me to repeat all of that?
Y/N
"oh well."
*trollface*
oh. whoops
:P
failure is just success rounded down.
Ironic
071hr of streamceptions!
The smartass's guide to gentlemanly conduct sez:
He's got 7 minutes and change to get here.
4We're giving you a trial run
XD
Puns.
why would a cadaver join me for brunch, though?
of corpse
6Six hours of talking. . .
mfw the bank rejects my payment for my pony shirt
6 hours, really?
okay, i'm missing something
Zombies. You are the lunch.
Damn
okay#
300?
does it merely try, or does it succeed?
All on ponies?
4However
Well, it is a SMARTASS's guide.
Alone?
6FOREVER ALONE D:
maybe it tries to succeed
07Awwww
RUN FOR THE HILLS
that's good enough, most of the time
in a savings account my nan and grandad set up when i was born
my friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore :(
when i turn 18 i get access to it
!
Hm, not sure..
^
I don't even know
or rather "dschaadsching ju"
that'd be awesome
sure
nice x)
how about "MY EARS ARE FLOPPING! MY EARS ARE FLOPPING!"
/me makes over $1400/month
LMAO
Thats the one you are talking about
/me is unemployed atm
ow.
You're killing me, Solo.
Ouch
Except for Rarity in that episode
I know. You told me already and I recorded it. Just tell me when.
Now, I've read the rules for this place twice...
There are rules?
I think its 23..
I wasn't aware that puns were kickable.
4And for that, we apologize for the inconvenience of how fast we went through the weeks
/me wanted to start studies in university but did not get in
*sadface
Yeah, it is
well, she was improvising, i suppose
I think it says in there somewhere that mods can kick you whenever they like.
Maybe it's one of those more universal laws
it's above IRC policy.
for being awesome^
If someone makes a pun that bad, you must punish them regardless of context.
They can pretty much kick you for whatever, since it doesn't really do any harm.
I can agree with that
Or something to that effect.
Banning is a different story
Hello
I got kicked yesterday for NOT linking something
Hiya
Hi DeniedExistenceMobile
This is literally going on for another hour? okay...
Hi DeniedExistenceMobile
Very well.
i can't hear a word most of the time
I crave house
omnomnomnomnomn
I'm sorry D: ahhhhh
it's okay
13Now all we need is Herospirit
13Hmm
House or sleep... house or sleep... house or sleep. It's too hard!
Why do I have to make this decision every day!
it's just middle of the night, have to keep my volume pretty low
idgi
i don't get it?
07yes
Yes
07as in the tv show
Denied, I'm playing Borderlands right now...
We do too
07~yay
but it's a difference in base-systems.
You're not a programmer I guess?
I believe it's a "Christmas < Halloween" joke.
I should sleep in the rain.
hm, my stream seems to be behind...
Base-8 31 = Base-10 25.
Then I shall grab my Mac
me? no, i'm nothing.
/me 13has no way to contact Herospirit
Tons of rain outside.
Just a matter of time before everyone watches ponies
Base-8 is Oct. Base-10 is Dec. you know, Decimal?
then house would be watching ponies instead of saving people
4Anything else you'd like to say?
07Well Pinkie we are leaving you now
Octal and decimal.
07House is gonna air
07thanks for the show!
No. Don't have to watch ponies /all of the time/.
31 in octal = 25 in decimal.
*shrugs*
Bye Pinkie!
4You'll be letting us know in a separate room
4We're gonna set it up for you
Yes you are.
4So if you see anything suspicious, alert it to us in that room
We're in a room dedicated to pastel ponies.
Math Is Hard
lol i feel mean now, but i really couldn't hear much
Lets go shopping
Very well.
Hahaha
LOL.
i should have focused on math
What's that?
Hmmmmmm
please.
Nice one, Triximancer. I remember that controversy.
i dont
I could hear her fine
That one is popular
Some people argue that 10 in binary is not actually two
and to those people I respond "bløøøh i am slave to ASCII encoding"
seems underage
Those people are wrong.
Hi
4Well, that went well
._.
hi.
My computert broke
I like this one
07indeed
don't think i've seen this... weird
07let's see if I can contact Synros too
wait wait wait wait.....
Nashy: Not if it is a signed integer.
This is one very trippy episode
*trollface*
To fix it, I had to turn it off. Hit it, swear at it, turn it on again, rinse rea[et
And, theyre ponies
ANd then suddenly I heard Pinkie Pie singing this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6E13xODyA&feature=related
It's kind of limited how many ints you can represent with a 2-bit signed integer
How data is represented in memory doesn't affect how binary works.
But I still think it's a boring way for me to kill someone.
WHile SPike plays the piano in that.
SnailsXLuna?
Wander off and moan, remember I had a backup tower, swear, unplug my old tower, replace it, load it
snipsXsnailsXstoned trixie
...wtf?
Eh, you're not missing much
and redownload my IRC client
Keep forgetting to.
and I'm back
Or maybe the would absorb INTO me!
07another Irene...
I rolled natural 20's in multitasking and dexterity
07damn
thank you
thank you for coming back
I've probably seen or read worse.
I read the first half, but could not finish
Wait...hold up
6IRENE!! DD: IREEEENEEE!!!
brb
4Go for it
RarityXThunderhooves?
Dammit Denied, you don't roll 20's for stats!
Get House! :P
Humbug.
hi
3d6 loser!
Oh pony
Back
Luna: Katia?
There was another fic that shocked me more
Random shipping!
hummingway + elizabeak, please
HI!
were you going to write a fanfic about Transvestie trixie?
hi.
Like I said, if I were to murder ponies I would prefer to do it in a more fun way like absorb them into my tail.
@Cupcakemeter
Because that'd be hilarious
07nope he's not on i'll e-mail him
I've got one trixiemancer... but it didn't work
I thought we were on season three. >_>
Solo: But I haaaaaate ponyshipping! ;-;
Lordlyhour: No, I wasn't.
=(
thank you
/me is sad
07omg
EMULATOR TIME
Hm
07your right!
nah, I've got emulators
@Kingmeter
boy oh boy, i turn 19 in 8 minutes
... Suddenly, I have the idea of this:
Sillyphilly
It's a fic which starts out nice with rainbow dash joining the wonderbolts and then out of nowhere at the middle of the story: This is now a clopfic
But this is such a good ep... >3>;
dat traffic cone
AJ/cockatrice?
cone
but real cartridge... that's how I role
thank ye
0@kingmeter
lolwat?
ha ha ha
is that me or the stream
Someone is using VLC media player!
seen this
But we haven't been through the cop plot line yet.
Dat product placement.
*bossa
I saw dat PSP.
No you dont it's just wasted potential, since it's a well written fic actually
*suddenly
XD
But then it just got ruined
Oh this is a fun episode too. I've seen all the episodes up to season 6. T
he looks like the alien abduction kid...
spikey pie. delicious
lol
Hi there ^_^
I like reading wasted potential.
hi
Fine, let me find it
Someone link Common Skies, stat!
Ok, Thanks =P
Don't want to rush things and make bad decisions though.
MORE!
4We don't but
4We really need mods
/me is giggiling like an idiot with posters of Spike and Pinkie pie
It's weird in the first place that Spike is even attracted to Rarity
lmao
Unless it's just for the gems on her flank
Quality > quantity and all though.
Hey anone here fic writers?
Back again

4I completely agree
Ship RarityxRock
4But we need to make compromises
FFFFFFUUUU
Rarirock is second-best ship

Haha, she's holding my birthday. Also I am definitely not ready.
I'm willing to pay.
4But yeah, no matter how much preparation we have we can't tell for sure exactly how things are going to go until we stream the first ep
you could just use a different name
Oh. I can't host those, sorry.
4Better be safe than sorry, y'know
07indeed
4Nope
mode +q Polarfire
4I want to see it though

...
...I think they are working on season 2.
Doubt. Probably look at the reception of Season 2 before doing 3.
You know, I would not be surprised if this show goes on for several seasons.
Polarfire! <3
DAT ATTICA!
Polarfire <333
Again with the product placement.
infinite recursion, oh yeah
From my understanding Hub is losing a little cash
but....
Maybe on their other junk shows
exactly, ponies is their star
yup
IT Crowd
I think I shall find more episodes of that... O_O It was awesome.
and how you should not break it!
Don't remember how long Sibsy said they had to finish per episode.
BAck. Okay guys, try to force me.
lol
no.
if only that wasn't accurate... that lady *shudder*
Like Triximancer
Poor kid. D:
I don't have TV here, or i would watch it
Solo: Link it again pl0x
*on
!link http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-common-sky.html
A fifth season of IT crowd has been commisioned says wikipedia. Do want
Haha yeah House doing clinic duty is fun.
!kill
Solo, you don't have to use !link in front of every single link you post.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/54313
Besides, a fanfic can't force me.
Sketchy_Sounds: Thanks anyway. :)
oh this lady again
But y'know, I guess I'll write it anywhere when I have the time.
Oh dear.
*anyway
This part.
At least it gives me an idea.
"Of course it is."
haha
dumb monolith
I want a fifth season D=
Lawl.
Derpy be killing everybody out here. D=
Me too!
What's e621
hetero ponies?
what's that?
Uhm. No?
/me facepalms
:p
Eh.
Hehe.
Whoa.
(not too origonal I know)
!moon YAAAAAY
"other crowd" means all you
Scary_Scott: Interesting idea
It has been done
But I suggest you keep at it
Everythings been done :P
Hehe
I'll never eat them again
Rear smear
Scary_Scott: I would suggest that you go ahead and start writing it, and have a more experienced writer or too look over it and suggest improvements.
/me pokes Polarfire
too jazzy j-pop for ponies
:P
Up his rear and get a smear.
**or two, pardon me
think he connected and afk'd.
did he died?
Solo: lol
No. =W=; I think House only kills like 1 person per season.
Hello
hi
Hi
I don't get the mmmmbananas reference
or beeotch
or however it's spelled
seen it...
It is stupid but for some reason I laugh every time I watch it.
Derpy should be able to link it.
Did my image not show up again? :/
I like it
!link friendship_is_magic_bitch
Wut.
Derpy Y U NO
Cruel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4f9m4OYkCY
Ahhh the real world! It burns!
We can't all live in Equestria can we? D:
I'd like to
Well Colbert's already converted
I know, I was there.
And that's quite the step
This things claims i have mail
lol
I know you were. I was there.
Steward and Conan next
Lol
Sorry, Laughing from bannanas...
LOL
Heh @ Nashy.
Harsh.
I may well have been. =p
Anyway
I'm going to write things now
I'm a little hyper today because Louisiana finally cooled down after a record-breakingly hot summer.
And Louisiana is like a jungle as it is
/me resists the urge to scream that one bit from Welcome To the Jungle
And thus speculation begun
I know this is random, but I was watching the episodes through again, and I noticed this awesome colored pony at 15:41 and 42 on this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzplcDyF90U Any idea if she has a name that we know of?
lawl
actually, i cant look at links atm -.-
oh I fail
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/42143?search=wallpaper
no way on the left
BLegh
One more.
When this episode aired people discussed whether House is autistic and thus can relate to the kid.
If she has a name, we don't know it.
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/45582
meh
Most background ponies don't have names...
Nashy: not canon names, but fanon ones
they let the fandom come up with the names.
Make up a name
I'm not good with names, lol
Yeah pretty much
how many show references
13AFK for a bit
man
Well a lot of the names are bad.
simply because it's copywritten
:(
No other reason.
Hi everypony!
April Showers?
!link ponies
hello Colson
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/34674
Anyone want a hug?
pony
wanna hear a joke?
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
<3
wtf
Colson: simmer down, you are spamming
According to this folder in my Desktop Ponies folder.
Solo, would you mind not doing my job?
where is that background pony list D:
ok then
"Unless you wanna make out."
Hehe.
!link everypony
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/49640
i won't quit my day job
You weren't asking.
Asking is where you say "Could you please stop doing that?"
07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6823033/1/#new
Whereas you outright just said "Stop that."
See the difference?
and now you know, And knowing is half the battle...
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36947
I would probably call her Rainy Day
I didn't think "Simmer down" was really that bad.
hmmm
awesome
Not all of us are very polite.
why does mobileme have a 14 page liscence agreement
Might be a colloquial thing. In my experience you tell someone to simmer down as a polite way to ask them to restrain their enthusiasm.
Uhm
Or even know how to be.
I had no problem with that part
Rather than asking nicely.
07mobile me... ? I thought mobile me was gone?
bye..
[15:15:41] <Solo> Colson: simmer down, you are spamming
^This is being politely informative
Not demanding he stop
Why does this never happen to me?
Just my two cents
dont ya meen Two Bits?
Anyhoo, back to minding my own business
You're not as awesome as House
Maybe I'm reading too much into it
And I don't go out that much.
/me shrugs
bits are like dollars, Scary_Scott
just my two centibits
House doesn't seem to do that either to be honest. xD
aww :(
Centibits. XD
(Nopony actually use centibits. Please no)
Well at least I'm not awesome. There's that.
wait...
Frogger?
:<
if you guys haven't seen it yet, SA made fun of us: http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/pound-puppy-bronies.php
*Their
Haha
awesome
'course they did.
Oh no.
They make fun of everybody.
And it's awesome.
but...
is this entire fandom mostly overweight guys
No
I am 137 lbs
That was posted earlier, and then it got taken down
um
Not overweight, no.
65 kgs here
People must have been mad
Mason_Trowel: Whoa.
Mason_TrowelHow tall are you?
5'6"
I am not just getting a good impression here.
Mason_Trowel: .....Whoa.
<.<
>.>
...I know. T_T
but yeah...
Interesting story
He ate the sandbox
Hmm, I think the bonus for Halflings is +2
Going for now! Bye bye!
is this higher concentration of weird people due to the fact I was in equestria study?
bye
DERP
However, I might only qualify as a Gnome, which I think is a +1
4Oh my
He accidently the whole sandbox.
On another site I'm on, there's an extremely autistic user named Trixie Buttercups
Not really, My_Little_Pootis
I wish season 2 would hurry up and come out...
shi-
4That's actually pretty...decent
I just don't know
EqD is PG rated
4for an Englishmen, after all
Daym House is awesome
If you think you're gonna encounter the really weird ones, you're mistaken
4*Englishman
They usually stay in EqAD
ITZ NAH A TUMAH
I imagine furries probably go to EQAD
Guys! <3
Polarfire <3
Howdi
I need my eyes to see
Howdy*
I have my doubts, that is all
meh
she Jelly
at least you're on now :D
atomic: It's a wiki. you can fix it.
KILL IT
Well, that's understandable.
My_Little_Pootis, I think that it would be wrong of you to assume that everyone is a creep just because of the eccentricities of the few.
somehow my client connected on its own this time... all I did was turn on the computer.
He's not doing her at all.
and yep :D
Well, alright then
Triximancer, I believe that EqAD is at least 50% furry, and since I see a bunch of the same people in here I'm willing to bet EqD is also significantly furry as well
...yet?!
20% cooler is 20% cooler than other memes
finally caught a time when Dari, me and you are online at the same time
There's no information collected to draw statistical conclusions from.
mai waifu
Solo: it's not like it's incorrect though...
haha
<333
Xiagu: it heavily depends on how you define furry ;)
Oh, you're back. :D
also this...
/me loves EQaD
since there are about 50 billion different definitions of it
>just as I need to go >_> <_<
it is a variety
noooooo.gif
and noooooooo
Or
D:
....
GreatNPowerfulPlanty: wat.
where ya goin Dari?
That's...huh.
I don't go in there
It's scary
4Frankly my dear
I know you did
4I don't give a damn
You get silly

DAMN

not sure if that's a good thing...
lol
No one does
Everypony is yelling and nopony is listening.
:P
After all that work to convince them we weren't weirdos.
I've been going on 5-5.5 hours a night for about a week and a half now....

Eh, we didn't work /that/ hard at it ¦¬]

Well I suppose I can stay on to talk with you guys.
Too bad he wasn't here to reminisce with us yesterday.
4ASSSSSSSSSS BERGERS
I have a friends with Aspergers
Plorf: I'm saying wierdo instead of something more forceful.
Weird
friend*
That's mainstream
mild form of it anyway
:D
I don't consider mainstream to be weird
ಠ_ಠ
/me nods
?
No meme is everlasting
ponies are beyond a meme
Ask that again in three weeks.
Solo: I wouldn't say that exactly.
But ponies aren't a meme
I have Ponybergers
Then we'll know for sure.
Hans Aspergers had one unlucky surname.
Scary_Scott: Neither
It's a fandom
ponies are a lifestyle at this point!
severe case, I'm afraid
That's my theory.
It's a dedicated fandom

I dunno. This is kind of a self-perpetuating fandom
DAAAWWWWWWWW

/me stuck here throughout the entire break between seasons

I have been pinged
Actually I should go to sleep too
/me has been here a long while as well.
why was I pinged?
good night
A break is different, there's going to be more content eventually
Because omi mentioned you, CogWeaver
Thanks for streaming Luna
Good night
/me hugs Luna
07your welcome

Sorry about that

Hmm, I might still come here if other people still did.

4NAO
It's fun to interact with everyone
Same here pretty much
I'll still be here for a long time, or at least in EAD, because the community there is awesome :)
If that stops, even if the show is still going, I'd drop the community, sure.
gnite :)
omg
No, no, no, it's PS3 that haz no gaemz
i watch this all the time
4I HAVE a PSP, and I have geams
and even if the show is cancelled, I would keep coming here.
6I'M AWESOME! :DD
it's like "wanna hear a joke? environmentally friendly firewood"
Watched them all.
For how long?
basically whatever you name next is just a joke
Nashy: There is no accurate way to guess.
I watched them all from start to finish in a single day
Nashy: there are old videogame fandoms that, due to sheer modding community, continue to this day.
:3
dari-bear
NoTrueScotsman.
PSP has pretty awesome games... but i have no PSP
dari-bear?
Same, Mason_Trowel
Lol, Solo. NoTrueScotsman
Mason_Trowel: same here XD
ep 7 is the one that hooked me
<3
<3
Hahaha
<3
show him some episodes, then?
And I watched the show in order
... yes :3
Ep 1 and 2 got me interested, but it was the following episodes that really got me liking it.
Could someone host something for me?
I liked the pilot a lot actually
Around there
Boast Busters is the best episode though
4It's like a show
4But with Ponies
4Tell him that
lol
4I dunno man
trojan*
I would probably say that I knew that I had succumbed 100% to bronydom with "Call of the Cutie". The moment Applebloom said "but I WANT IT NAOOOOO!" I knew there would never be any going back for me.
4FOOD
Any reason you can't just show him some eps?
07Just let him watch an ep
07:)
It's a Runescape not
lol
cute :3
I watch pilots and then get hooked or stop watching.
4Just do not pick Look Before You Sleep
still not going to run random executables from trangers over irc, that's just stupid
4That's the closest to a girly episode they had in the first season
I loved Twilight in the pilot
"The ponies in this town are all CRAZY!"
Twilight in the pilot struck me as being a huge bitch at the start, but by the end of it I'd really warmed up to her.
throat closing up shot no. 529
..without a bunch of crazy ponies *eyeroll* trying to make friends all the time.

She was something of a recluse, and I can really relate to that.
Oh thats just too awesome....i want a rainbow dash sweater
DAMMIT

Skipsy: I note one of his friends has--what Solo said
http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-explains-it-all.jpg

Twilight is just asocial and has more important things to do.
And poor social skills.

OH SHI-
4Then why change the theme song per channel?
different countries
copyright laws
It's just some little hidden references in the coding or something
and that's how Equestria was made
/me pops a coca-cola body and takes a sit
*sip
We need to try to get Equestria Daily up to 40 million pageviews before Season 2.
Wouldn't YOU like to know, dearie
Here he is!
yup
oh wow, I remember this douchebag
/me 4wonders if Britain airs House
Oh, I'm sure it'll be there by Season 2
Solo: DDOS servers!?
:(
incoming arc
QUIZ!
Hmm?
Plays the part well
Well, as the name implies, I'd say shipping.
Oh, now I get ti
it
Enough people spamming refresh for pageviews = DDOS :/
Oh and... this was also at camp. lol http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_2700.jpg
D:D
OH SHIT
DDOS?

Camp?
ㅇㅅㅇ
Wut?
I went camping
4I don't find anything wrong with his attitude
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack
Huh...
Nashy: that would be a *lot* of page refreshes
Is that you in the suit?
Skipsy, where did you go camping?
....Skipsy. I think that's called "clubbing", not camping
Looks nice, I guess. Definitely colorful.
I really don't like this story arc
(now 3 I guess :P)
HAHAH
How would you know Omi?
I don't...
Umm...
Also I like how someone dyed their hair rainbow.
I just asked
until hours later
But you made a good guess, someone stole my camera and took that picture.
Well probably Silvermane is a regular
TROLOLOLOLOLOL
Yeah
Right
that's one.
...really? Odd.
Well... it makes sense that it belongs to you or someone close to you

Ha! I bet now that he has said that, he's inadverdantly revitalized the meme.
Whats this movie?
4It's House, libraryaddict
Mason_Trowel: Perhaps that's his plan.
it's SilverMane XD
depends on if connections every get established
Someponies think they can outsmart me. Maybe.....maybe....
4I think the cane trip is a bit too much, but I still think House needs to be put in his place sometimes
really? XD
Yeah
Ponies in Socks
GGgala needed a second alt to ship with Two-Bits
he was ShadowMane in #BronyState earlier today
4I'm an asshole
4I like assholes by default
Socks make me have to go potty.
This is me not being weird, with my camera. http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz241/Skipsy_Dragon/FN%202011/IMG_5001.jpg
Its really simple... dont touch me.]
4Ah
4OH SHIT

4DUEL DIAGNOSIS

Skipsy: You look young.
You can still see the 20% cooler shirt. xD
Skipsy looks a lot like somebody I know
wait... whut

Solo, 1. I am done potty. 2, I am dissapoint.

You wouldn't happen to be /related/ to them both would you?

Ding ding ding ling liiing
it's more like "aboat" really

You could ask people
"Are you a brony?"
If I just do that, they'd give me a wierd look, I bet.

On weekends, it depends on my work, which can be sporadic

Fluttershy is probably close age wise to him
ty
/me 3takes a swig from the flask, then tucks it away.
2Ah lighten up. I'm just messin withca'll.
I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing.
lolwut
07magic!
4Razyn if you had any money you would probably spend it on hookers
there sure is a lot of references in this drawfriend
He didn't shrink. It's clearly YoungMac and YoungFluttershy
*different references
It's not that NSFW
You can tell cuz Fluttershy is gangly.
There's far more implied than shown.
2Pony hookers...?
2What?
3Oh god...pony hookers...*Shiver*
...
4Do you have any experience with moderating?
10XD
10that was just
2...Do they have those?
05haha
10well that was just House.
WTF?
/me 3takes another swig to drain the thought from his head.
05CrystalClear perhaps its the hair?
I am....bored o.o
05indeed
2Meh
However, I have the almighty wall socket!

is this just fantasy
2My mistake
Rancid is caught in a landslide.
no escape from reality
>win
3Surely you don't mean me?
WUT
I have a pretty ridiculous work ethic. I don't like leaving things undone, and I don't really care to see things done wrong. But that doesn't make me a team player; my job, as well as my current pathway through college emphasize working as a team to get things done, and I enjoy it. I'd more or less be on call to help out whenever I am on without any qualms.
13Lol
rofl i have a goatee allso
13AFK for a bit, gotta take my shower
It's awesome no?

You only go crazy if it's a clopfic.
CLOPPER
/me nods
I have Lauren's autograph. I framed the restraining order.

Xiagu is such a perv.

Dino Spimony
/me re-engages lurk mode for reals this time
from someone else
It doesn't work when YOU do it, silly Tbuddy7
*Spumony
11(you just realized that by the infinite-universe theory, Equestria really exists)
If you mean the character from Hey Arnold
:P
/me 3already knew this.
4(I knew that)
ha
*Tbuddy*
did it work?
Yes
:D
6Goodnight Dari~ :3
Uh oh
11(knowing and realizing are two different things
4http://i142.photobucket.com/albums/r118/ValtheJean/131154337367png.jpg
Wait, no...
Technically it came out in 1983
o.o
3(Did you know that the best way to get to another universe would be to die in this one?)
/me 11cuts her throat
!muffinkiss

In the year 2000...
11didn't work
/me stretches
random shows or are there regulars(not including ponies
Tbuddy7, how many MFLOPS do you get
looks like it's more ShadowMane to go arou--
2Nice prop
in the year 2000 that would be newgrounds quality
07I like his answers
Xiagu MFLOPS?
oh, she's back.
MFLOPS?
Some of both.
Depends on the streamer midor
whoah, how do you do that bold thing
PFLOPS!
11what was that about Shadowmane?
A CANDLE
4Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
to traditional animation
4Do you have anything to add?
sometimes
Maybe.
yeah but traditional animation takes too long
actually, a lot of the time
we've accepted worse
:P
Yes
Thank you!!
/me glomps MrMooMoo
4I actually believe he owes me
Oh, nothing....
nice

!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/53621
Xiagu where do i find out on my phone?
Shouldn't that be abbreviated MOFPOPS, then?
Derpy with a lawnmower seems frightening.
4What do you guys think?
o_O
All right
but imagine the sheer BEAUTY
2IC?
and GRANDEUR
4Please remain in this room
Night Dari
(in-character?)

13Ehhh...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_HWaTaUVns&feature=related
(ninja'd)
K, cya in a bit, Midor
13I missed some of it
The show's music was amazing
I should probably look >>
Mason_Trowel words like of, and, the arent abbreviated
2Who, you?
3(HIIIIIYAAAAA)
Gmod
13I get this feeling from him though.
I'm watching Yu Yu Hakusho

DELICIOUS

Oh, I knew that. :P I am wondering where the "L" comes from, though.
dat... mIRC?
dat leitmotif
10mfw text
3(AKA, Not breaking the 4th
3)
13I'll have to take a look at the whole interview on the forums.
10hey barry
4We decide now
Rainbow Dash's background was pretty epic :D
4We're pressed for time
3Snap out of it!
13I can't make an honest decision since I missed some of it.
2It's in my nature...
4anyways if you wanted cuteness, this group of colts wouldn't be the place to find it
07Octa it's on the forums
o hai Octav
07I posted it 10 seconds flat ago
2Yeah.
Someone wanted cuteness?
6I believe he did alright. . . He seems dedicated and, though he has a lack of ideas, I'm going to vote ~yay~.
/me 3takes a sip from his flask.
Oh, it's you.
Xiagu 7.473
11(are they all staring at me?)
oh man
sad face
13I don't recognize his name...
wheres the one BGM where Pinkie pie discovers that her friends don't want to be her friends anymore
/me is sad now.
2Derp
yousa say he gonna die?
4Most of you won't
I think it's a yes
Wait whut?
It's a 6ft tall violin! We established this!
07http://s13.zetaboards.com/BronyState/topic/6824588/1/#new
/me has it on mute.
Lawl

07oui
Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
4He is my friend
lol violin cello or bass?
15...
13This was one of the apps I didn't feel too good on...
Xiagu why do you ask?
Bass please.
Self-cest
/me 11poofs her mane
Tbuddy7, because I have an intercept and I was thinking of upgrading
Thats not the first time that happend.
I'm gonna be honest I didn't like the app either
/me 2EXTRA HARD
WildPlastic, all time, classical, modern, or ...?
HANS ZIMMER
4I felt iffy about suggesting him in the first place because I didn't want to seem like I was forcing him on the team. But he honestly did want to apply when I brought it up to him that we were looking for mods
haha
rereading the interview now
dat hivemind
/me 11poses for her sudden attention. 'At least they have taste'
13lol
Xiagu i got the virgin mobile plan for 35 bucks a month 300 inutes and unlimited text and data, the phone was 150
2You wanna fuck?
think it's time to log out of ffxi for the day
/me 2smirks
Lemon_Lime: link?
/me 11can't hear any of you as she is in a cafe across the way
Hans Zimmer is genius.
I have returned.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2RMy5z43w&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL Here ya go
hey guys what's going on in here
/me looks back at everyone else.
4DE, is it me or is she posing?
/me 11cocks her head, curious at the gesture
WildPlastic, as a sweeping answer, i would say handel, weiss, strozzi
Did he do any other videogames?
No.
I dunno. They seem to be watching someone.
Solo, welcome back
/me is still reading
6One thing I noticed is that, he didn't seem *too* interested in dropping in beforehand. " I suppose I would spend it moderating and stick around for longer amounts of time. The times I dropped in, I mainly came just because a movie I enjoyed was airing."
that was byootiful
/me is also reading
/me follows the colts' transfixed gazes.
Octacia: You're the real deal!
Ooh, yeah...
*Otavia
Pirates of the Caribbean
hello
That cafe... their sandwiches look delicious...
Lol
And of course several others
6We know you're not trying to do that dearie :3
I know. I was there yesterday. :)
/me 3facehoofs.
4god those two are thick....
Solo, I am back to work, 11 hours ahead of me.
07he followed the normal process
I wouldn't know.
The best part of MW2 was the music IMO.
brb
/me 2giggles. "Works everytime."
Gotta. Finish. Econ HW..
Worth every bit.
2I'm always *up* for some fun.
/me 3whispers, "Keyword: Came"
05*thud*
/me 2flutters his wings
11 hours that sucks
dumb ethernet cable...
Hey, everyone!
dumb fabric
Okay done with homework,
Watching house, I see.
4We had to teach you
Hey Jen!
gta4 or tf2
13Well, I'm used to a more... lax atmosphere.
07I say yes for a trial - run
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9VwPbj9Tw&NR=1
/me 3laughs.
/me 2trots across the street to the cafe
3Yeah, I know right?
BOOM
Getting all hyped up for S2. I'll be watching it with you all, live.
3Any bets?
:P
Rainbow
I have to hit that.
Hi, Jen
Hi Jen and yay~
13Things that would get you banned here, would be a first offense kick in most places I've modded.
10I'm gonna have to be honest and say that from my perspective he needs a scrutinised trial run.
/me 2goes to give the thumbs up, but can't
MrMooMoo: My default answer is TF2
Technically it's a geode.
TF3
10Like, he needs to prove he's going to be active
4i bet 10 bits that she'll turn him down
Hat fortress 2!
/me 11peaks over and sees the movements
Is that the first it airs?
07indeed
I thought it aired 6:30 PM
depends on time zone Barry
3Oh yeah? Well I bet 50 she does.
10Yeah but I mean a well-scrutinised trial run dude
Gotta rank up in Pony Fortress...
4After the DE fiasco, we realized we need to scrutinize
3Er...she goes for him that is.
4you're on
13*trial
9 AM EST
No jewelers needed in Equestria.
But i just downloaded GTA4
Not this saturday, the 17th, but it is 9 EST
/me shoves GGgala back.
-thumbs up-
DAMN IT WAS HARD
I asked for it!
11I-I think it would be best if you didn't.
You don't deserve it!
/me 4does the same and shakes DE's hoove
(it was pretty darn hard on medium.)
...
I just beat it
good for you
/me rolls GGgala off.
/me 4looks at the two fighting colts then back to DE
4So?
4Trial run?
agg
idk
I see the models... I'm going to see if I can find someone to rig them >>
05My oppinion, yes.
10So yes to a trial run, but he needs close watching yeah
07and that concludes tonights show
ME.
07I hope you all enjoyed
Mason_Trowel: I wanted to spar with you before. Now that I know how tall you are, I want to co-op with you against my other friends.
>mfw I JUST ARRIVED
Q_Q
13I'm really really torn on him honestly. But a trial isn't a for sure, it's a nice way of determining eligibility though.
/me hugs Luna
10Thanks sathi:)
3...!
goshdarnit
/me bucks GGgala.
Hey Sky.
6Yes to trial.
4Octavia?
aaagh
/me 2obviously feigns hurt. "Oh?" He stepped closer. "Hey, come on. Why not? I'm not that bad a guy."
4god this is more entertaining than watching that MILF pose from across the street
13Sure to trial.
:)
07Tomorrow more ;)
4Alright, I'll let him know
why?
Thanks!
Solo: I...don't know whether to be flattered or insulted by that comparison...
As always
4Marceline?
3Think we should stop them DecapKing? Or do you want to wait and see if they warm up to each other?
I'll take it as a compliment, though
10he's back at school now
aaawww its over
Yeah
why is my name changed?
4We're giving you a trial run
05thank you sahti!
Mason_Trowel: Probably neither. I'm ~6'5"/6'6"
it rolls throug my head like many other stories
4who the MILF and raze or GG and dash?
Anyone under 6' qualifies as a projectile to me.
No Dee
/me THANK YOU SECOND BEST PONY LUNA
someone talk to me
4However
I do adaptions here.
darnit, him too?
...Roman?
no dee
i guess
not how it works
Mason_Trowel: That's why we'd make a great team. I'd have them looking up, while you're sniping them from below :P
/me headbutts GGgala.
4Starting at 7 PM EST
10Is that copypasta?
I need to help ma with groceries
/me 2waved one of his forehooves. "Naw, naw. They ain't my friends." He looked back at them. "But neither are you, which is disappointing to say the least."
4good point
4But please, feel free to come in sooner
4Yep
Or we could pull a Fastball Special. Lol XD
10Because that's a really good little paragraph
13Nice wording and use of the trial run. I like it.
4Well
4Most of it
NO ONE
4you think you can get GG?
Sky: Reload the page or get an irc client.
/me 2flinches and turns around.
/me hits GGgala with a left hook.
over, sideways, and under
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
on a magic carpet ride
4Thanks
/me 3pounces GGgala. Holding him to the ground.
STAY BACK. He's mine
!help
no one to tell us no, or where to go
or say we're only dreaming
He's quoting lyrics from Aladdin
3Hell naw.
Jigglypuffffff
how do i change my name back?
/me punches DecapKing.
Stay out of this!
4Everything from "We're giving you a trial run" is my own words taken from an earlier interview
4Everything down, that is
to get booted for spam?
10?
jigglypuff jigglypuff
Probably just to spam.
/me struggles against Denied_Existence
Sky: go /nick Sky_
nah, I like you guys
Unidentified61232: /nick
but I feel the music in me!
10at 7 EDT?
lol the jigglypuff song
If you wanted to mount me you should've asked!
Because Sky is already registered.
………………_„-,-~''~''':::'':::':::::''::::''…
/me 3picks GGgala up and rolls him down the street.
noo
/me 3picks up the sammich.
To differentiate.

jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglypuff jigglyjigglypuff

/me slips out of the hold
All right
3Here, have a present for the lady.
/me tackles DecapKing
yes
4That concludes the interview, you are free to leave
There.
thxu peoples
4In his interview, it said his work schedule is sporadic
10trial*
I would ask my girlfriend but she isn't here.
doesn't it jumble the words?
4Because that's when we'll really need him
/me 4notices the smashed bottle of Vodka on the ground
4oh
4hell
4no
/me snatches Denied_Existence's legs, dragging him down to the ground with him
10Yeah, but we've just said he can leave without having set a real trial date then
THE BOOZE!
10unless I have the complete wrong end of the stick?
07[02:50] <Ghosties> Starting at 7 PM EST
07[02:50] <Ghosties> But please, feel free to come in sooner
WHY IS THE BOOZE GONE?!
/me 3punches GGgala, bloodying his snout.
eh...
10oops miscopypaste
My Little Pony: Tomodachigai wa Mahou
/me sidesteps the charge and sticks a leg out, tripping DecapKing
13Set him up in a separate room? We talking about after all the rooms are established?
/me leaps on Denied_Existence's back, biting at his ear
10>miss the whole entire BMN?
Well brb!
....make em good
Oh.
That poor family.
I'm living at the top of Equestria

/Giddyup/
Although, you'd probably need a 'desu' at the end of that.

10What's happening with D_E for the future?
*pink mare's world
4wait i did?
4oh
/me feels interviewed.
YES!
10Or, has anything significant happened since I last checked?
4well sorry about that
4He's still on trial
/me 3punches GGgala in the gut.
/me 3bucks his left, back leg into GGgala's groin.
10CrystalClear nope.avi
Trollin' way too much, I need a moment
WildPlastic, absolutely. i adore her completely.
/me 3continues to shrug off GGgala's blows.
4anyways i guess DE and i broke up the fight between you and GG
My little crazy schizoid mare
4Simply because we need the numbers
10sure
/me 15waves.
4and you can get a sandwhich
10I'm pretty sure he's learned his lesson about cooling it a bit.
.....
10However I'd like to see how he does with half ops again
*hear
13I remember his app.
/me 2tosses his name at Razyn_the_Pony
Blums, prefer standard ties, do not know why everypony wants to perpetuate the bowtie.
4want to go and stop DE and GG from fighting now?
/me 15catches the name.
lol
...
10 bits on GG
/me pouts
Solo, did you know racecar spelled backwards is racecar?
lol wut
/me 3opens his mouth when GGgala swings a second time, then bites down hard.
4i dont know
NO ways!
/me 15inhales. "This feels... Better."
/me goes back to lurking now
WAYS
AHHH
10Sounds like a fair move
ok
4*groin
I feel like I can go back to drawing now.
I think it was enough of a break
Luna_In_Socks, Yes, apparently.
/me 3bucks GGgala off once more.
sure
Rainbow Dash would be a variety of flavors.
10have fun alliszero:P
/me 15turns around. "So, Ms. Clear. I hope you don't think ill of my father."
Rainbow Dash: Is Rainbow Swirl
Solo, i did not like stacks at first, then it just popped.
/me 3has one of his lower front teeth knocked from his mouth.
3Ah...hell naw.
4sorry about nearly hitting you when i threw my friend
Zorotokon, tacos
13Ah, yeah. lol Thought maybe it was initially posted a bit before. lol
/me doesn't want to bother the fillies and colts with anything he couldask lol
Solo, as degree in programming
10Lolwut.
11...

/me 10goes to EqD

/me 3rolls on top of GGgala.
WUT
15Sort of...
uh oh
Seth's snapped
well i guess i got to log off for now:/
15I was created in lab.
Well, I think I'm going to catch a few hours of snoozey-time, while the moon is on course and my mean ol' sis is asleep.
/me 3has one of his eyes blackened, the other missed by the blow.
13As for DE. I think he's learned his lesson.
oh that type of clop
Night Meteorventure
15...And his name.
EQD I am dissapoint
XD mfw
10oh shit awesome, it's chillout/progressivey housey music
/me wheezes and tries to shove Denied_Existence off of him
/me 3uppercuts GGgala, knocking 3 teeth from their positions.
11alrighty then...
10and it's apparently from the UK
10so win on that front
6How's everypony? :3
11oh dear
Bpendragon, ayecarumba! physics? all I need to know about that is things fall when I trip over them
/me 3sideswipes GGgala, popping an ear-drum.
Don't make me mad again.
I misses the "album" in dari's post because it said clop
10Better than youu :D
10RDash as did I...

Bye-ee!!!!
/me proceeds to punch Denied_Existence repeatedly, in the stomach, on both ears, and several times in the ribs
Solo, going for my masters in liberal arts..?
/me 3does the same to the right leg.
AGGGGGH

11I am a Unicorn, of course
4By the way, DE isn't going to be given a trial
You people.
/me grabs Denied_Existence's stallionhood between his forehooves and squeezes
<---is eating Quiznos
4I'm sorry if I made it sound like that
11(^ wtf man)
3MOTHERFUCK
13Power. Notoriety. Or rather "E-Fame", as much as I hate that word. These things can go to ones head rather quickly.
4'trial' meant that he was still on probation
13Oh?
Greetings Jazza.
/me headbutts Denied_Existence back
(low blow man...)
4damn this is an entertaining fight
15I can see that...
Bpendragon: My school HAS a degree program in physics, but it sucks
Solo, the p is lowercase
Hello there Zoro
13I figured he was still on probation and we were just going to give him hop again at some point.
/me 3headbutts GGgala repeatedly! A large gash is torn in GGgala's head!
10How?
NOW PLAYING "My Selene" ...*
10Me people.
/me 3uppercuts GGgala again! 2 more teeth are knocked loose!
11(thank you boombox)
/me turns to DecapKing. "Excuse me a moment."
/me 3grabs GGgala, lifting him into the air.
welp
/me running tackles both GGgala and Denied_Existence.
How are you today Jazza?
Alright, break it up you two!
whaddyamean you people.
I'm very good
/me 3is knocked to the ground.
/me afks briefly to help someone around the house
*job
4You didn't hear?
3Fuuuck...man...
/me oofs
hello :3
4We temporarily demodded him
heyy
Good luck! Hope you do well.
Thanks
...*
Damn it...
4>temporarily demodded
4That's the probation
Oh. Well that's alright then.
4He's in timeout for now
10..So suspension, not probation?
(XD)
Coffee house, with some cool jazz playin ponies.
3But ya mouth appears to be in shambles.
4Whatever
yess
/me spits
4Basically, we're watching him
Yours, too.
/me 3laughs.
Bpendragon: If you ever want to talk shop about academics, just lemme know.
11yes?
Hi!
!s2
Season 2 begins in 10d:11h:52m:59s
3Eh, 1:5 is a good score.
:DDDD
/me raises an eyebrow, wincing
4Pretty much
One to five?
Does it start in the AM or the PM?
3Eeeeeeyup
I'm not sure
10we need to see how he reacts WITH mod powers
noo
10to make sure he doesn't go OTT again
11Nothing worth mentioning dear.
4so you said no to him?
/me 15eyes DecapKing
soo coffee shops
13I've talked to him a little bit. I think he's learned his lesson. For now at least. As long as he doesn't go back into again at some point.
I dont understand subgenres in electronica
House? wut?
10ofc we can just give him hop and then de-hop him if he acts like a tard, but I'd like to avoid having more random '+m -> SHOUT AT STREAM ABOUT NOTHING -> -m' moments
About a week and a half left.
That doesnt mean anything
think I read 9AM and 6PM
Haha Blums.
aww man
Sure it does.
which is it
but now I have to play D3.
No.
lol the pony leak?
He DecapKing! Get over here!
/)^3^(\ <-- Dashface
/me 4turns to his friends
They ALWAYS use meta reference.
They won't.
WoW has a bajillion pop culture references.
/me mutes
mk
13I know. lol
/me 3pulls GGgala up.
Man, why does my teacher keep making references to snorting coke?
13I'm just stating. I can tell he's mellowed out now.
Yes, we are college kids, but this is Utah.
My teacher keeps referencing to little orphans in peril. But then again I'm taking Philosophy.
Hmmm, maybe The Alfalfa Club? Star-bucks? I'm not very good at this :)
/me looks back to Denied_Existence
/me 15winces
star-colts?
10he may also just be mellowed out because he's unhappy.
Nothing...
10to be honest, like I can see it's affected him, being de-hop'd for now
11Oh? umm. Oh. OOHH... No, NOO of course not. He didn't even ask anything of the sort
13Well, hes unhappy he was put on probation.
/me 3raises an eyebrow.
(ponyshrug.jpg)
10ninja'd ;)
3.....
idk maybe
13lol
*squeak
10that's my fear
dat dash face.
4oh, well i am sorry to bother you, also if you are looking for SilverMane, you might be able to find him at his job
11Oh? Alright. Thank you dearie
4i think he works at the pizzeria
15He has some of the most erratic hours, though.
I'm pretty damn sure no one in this classroom has done coke.
Maybe the teacher.
10pretty much
But that's it.
/me 4turns around and starts to walk back to his friends
4HEY DE YOU OWE ME 50 BITS!
This show hasn't been out for two seasons yet
3FUUUUUUUUUUUUU
3Fine
13Not like we can't take his powers away again if he acts up again.
XD
10What are you listening to?
13If he acted up again this time however. Well, that's it.
10(@ all of you:D )
Probably about 80 as of now.
Pfft. Never.
4not sure
Was 100+ at the start.
I'm reading.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJAPiRhRT8
4besides he wouldnt even pay if i did win
Solo, it takes time to make a show. Equestria wasn't built in a day.
11Umm, i don't know anymore
/me 3hands over 50 bits.
It was totally a non decision.
11i'm going to go now
/me 4takes the bits
4damn you guys are fucked up
Yeah it's awesome!
WildPlastic: Nonsense. It hasn't been crossed over with Majesty yet.
Plastic, just wander back in time.
*right
4hows the damage on me?
3(And toothy to say the least.
:p
11I'm fine
10I can't remember
07indeed
It also hasn't been cross over with other eighties and early nineties shows.
/me mutters, "I'll let you have *my* sandwich..."
10like, in the IRC
I can name quite a few.\

I work in a machine shop
13And then popular background characters
/me pokes Sidestroke
13And the CMC of course
15You know nothing of mean pranks! M'lady has us on the greatest, meanest prank of all!
13Why don't we just have ONE specific character?
/me hurfs.
I want to learn Japanese!
13But Herospirit...
13That would be mean to spam with ALL of the mane six.
I've worked here for 3 months... last week I work... chips in my skin
I need

I go!

Was supposed to be Fluttershy
XD
/me grabs Decap's hind legs
3Naw, just leave him here.
3Well I had to make him ready SOMEHOW...
Herospirit, I have an idea
XD
it even refers to FIM as "set to air"
3It's "Integral"
/me 15is worried he can't do a very good Applejack
It wouldnt be easy..
5IDEEEAAA!
like it's been totally abandoned
aww come on
/me raises eyebrow, glance down at Decap
Would require alot of coordination
There's three parts they liked me for.
He he.

Don't worry, it works.

Erm.. We lost Rarity..

3Yeah...whatever you want to call it...
NO!
We can't lose Rarity!

Zorotokon I know >:)

I'm only hamming it up as it were
/me 3pulls GGgala out of the house.
4mommy?
15The PLANS are the reason the bunker exists
Maybe
Hey! Aren't we gonna even watch?!
brb
13I don't get it! Ahhhh!
Lyra/BonBon and Octavia/DJPon3 only shipping I'll ever allow
0Awww okay!
and that's because it's ridiculously cute
Right after this commercial break!
15COUNFOUND THESE PLANS. THEY DRIVE ME TO DRINK
4no, no get away from them.....
And now we lost Applejack..
NO
ABUUUUUUUUUUUUU
6These plans drive me to clop
That okay?
Oh, you.
yes.
and most of them are musical ponies
How are we losing all these Ponies?
15Pinkie_Pie, has our operation gone any further? I'm going crazy over here
lol
15and TWILIGHT HOW DO YOU KNOW OF THE PLANS
15err
Random break for teacher taking a phone call.
Of course we /could/ have had our own fun first with those phera-things...
0Who knows but it's not good!
But still, Applejack can take care of herself. She's not afraid of getting dirty
Most Caramac is quite adorable.

/me jumps.
/me splats.

lol
See?
oh dear
i see
well, HoN seems to be fucked up
13Nothing else can be progressed, its all down to Silvermane and Denied_Existence finishing
guess I'll just play some Sc2

Caramac is my favorite ship.
13-sits down, starts to eat popcorn-

Fluttershy can STARE the sh*t out of anyone

...This *is* Silver's house, rigt?
yeah, rainbow dash can outfly everyone
oddly enough
13We lost Applejack, Rarity, and Twilight...
Well I thinkthebronyshow.net does some live streams

O.o
Erm.. Yeah... Ignore me for now

Thank you!!

He's a shipper.
13Oh you silly fillies there's probably a ipaddress tracker that wont let you log in as more than one character at a time.

Oh and, did I mention that a shipping thought suddenly hit my head when I hate ponyshipping?

Also: It's my favorite racist marshnmallow, everyone say hi!
cheer up people
hey
racist?
Alright :3
H-Hi...
Dat me
wut
05there we go
05can be a bitch sometimes cant they?
nicserv goes ping
T_T
Lawl no.
I mean IRC wise
I'm hosting the server and the services server.
Wrek's hosting another server.
Hi, Dari
Hey Barry.
05ohai
That's why computer's supposed to be on all the time.
I see
05so far mine hasnt been acting up too much
ohay again ponies
05but other than that i should have a stable uptime
hooray, services are back :D
Hi Pinkie_Pie
Hi Barry
Or does NS/CS keep up with that
05all that data is stored at the service one iirc, besides no information is changing, jstu an hardware update basically
Passport export server is screwed
05though dari might want to correct me on that
Well since we'll be moving, when we do, everything needs registering again, yeah.
Hmm
We shouldn't be moving again after this though.
Howsit going?
Oh hey RP
eh, lots of phlegm but it could be worse, how's u guys?
Good
everyone is ILL today
I'm not
Whatchoogaisdoing?=
Aww still sick?
right can I be bothered to work on my IRC cilent today
writing an IRC client?
Surprisingly I'm not ill even through I've been quite close to sick people lateley
I have an old totlay home made client but I've lost the source and it had issues
haven't ever used pidgin for IRC...
it's ok
if you don't mind ugly ways roudn soem issues and bitchy formating
window's 7
just like pidgin
also I've farted around with libpurple enought to custom plugins ect
okay
http://p.mdcd.net/product_images/full/45088d763f5d1a90ab6af7ff344a57890860b6ef.jpg
*related
yeah it's really fexiable also a really low foot print compaired to say running windowsLive and or AIM ect
official clients do tend to suck
yeah
pidgin's biggest flaw is lack of video/audio
Pidgin is working on it but it's a lot of work
It doesn't? well, color me disappoint
The closest there is to a reference that I see is the enemy horse called:
That could just be coincidence.
THe rest of it contains no proper references IMO.
Agree Dari
I wasn't very ecstatic about it either
turns out i showed up to this wyrd 101 thing about 2/3 through this podcast (if it even is a podcast)
and "Nightmarity"... though there's zero evidence that not all of them are just coincidences
oh.. well.. i'm rather unsure.. i remember something like.. setting authority levels for people
yep
I beleive
believe*
/msg cs help set
Owait
I think that it's quite likely that all that is just a reference to their april fools joke from way back when...
Maybe
http://madgearsolid.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/diablo3unicorn.jpg
i'm sure everyone remember that...
Okay
Thanks, it worked
that's helpful
Don't remember it.
x3
Thats the idea..
because they were idiots, and hadn't played D2
I have 3 mane 6 names registered
I want other people to be able to use them
x3
But, AOP wont work unless identified
I mean OH no colour!
yeah
Because I cant use all 3 of these names myself
still even if planed as a joke pony level from pre FiM dosen't mean no FiM nods
But, I am finding limitations in my idea
yup
even just the mild naming nod that are hinted at now
you might be able to make a script
as it does look like tey planed a unicorn and rainbow level as a joke
yeah, doesn't seem too far fetched, but I guess we'll see
yup we'll see
It wouldnt work like that
Names Denied
Names
Well I caught that much.
Which ones eh?
phone suppoooorrrtttt
I want other people to be able to use the names to
have you tried turning it off and on again?
That's good.
x3
Whats good?
never had to do that
Haha
Yeah there's a button
lol
then I was laid off
Button on the side
Is it glowing?
Yeah, then you need to turn it on
sent me soem right messy shit to debug
uncomented, goto's the work
How many earth ponies were watching the Best Young Fliers contest?
The only fix I can think of, is making me a sort of overseer of the names instead of a direct owner
we are observant... not autistic
that doesn't sound fun
two
there are probably some errors
i think 3
D=
It was held in Cloudsdale. There can't be many.
I just rewrote it in the end
Applejack and Pinkie, nay?
asked his boss for the breif and did it behind his back
I'll need names, of course. Not just random guessing numbers.
Okay...
it was that shit and he wouldn't take I'm not debuging that shit as an answer
Lol
he my personal code is a mess but I never expect any one to need to look at it
whoof
The limitations I am talking about, is that Automated services like AOP do not work unless the account is identified
I don't actually remember, just assuming since those are the only ones that should be able to stand on clouds
it is an alternative universe version of him
all the earth ponies
most fun I had ever was righting in machine code
it was horrid
Well of course.
Guards are pegasi though D:
but fun
mostly as I know most people can't do it
Yeeeah I can't fathom how that is
Is it possible to add something like a "Master Password" on the name, and have other people be able to add their own?
the more you know
its HORRID and I doubt I coudl do it now
That's one of those things I'd be interested in doing just because of that :p
yeah you get an elitest kick form machine code programing
but is to slow for real work
Why would we need that?
Okay, time's up.
leroy?
Lyra's also there, hopping around in the background of a few shots.
Yeah, I bet
like 50 odd bits for ad fro reg balh to reg blah out put to blah
They can use the name w/o a password already!
I want to prevent that
and yoy have to do every thing with reg manipulation
Best shot to see her is near the end, behind Rarity as she apologises to Dash.
But really my programming is quite basic, been a long time since I did it now
Which by registering them, and not enforcing them, you have.
therefore no earth pony?
You can't have multiple people registering the same nick though regardless.
i see
which is good
Because that defeats the whole purpose of the registration system.
Meh..
It literally makes the whole thing defunct.
I hated pointers and stacks more than anything
Makes sense to me Dari
Because two people can't use the same nick at the same time.
stacks?
I think that makes just three unicorns, though.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJfZTr8zMsc
:P
Hold on
Hahaha
stacks aren't that nasty
And each need the nick to get ops, owner, or whatever in different channels.
its GUIs I hate coding
Then both can't be on at the same time.
fuckign interfaces
I just hated them, I have a hard time with abstract thinking
Trying to get magic lessons of course
sudyed philosophy, comupting and mathamtics you can see where my head sits
well it seems like it's time for me to go to sleep
Okay
Bye MeteorVenture
G'night MeteorVenture
Hey, Cokes.
goodnight yall:D
'Sup.
I'm sure you don't know me. *shrug*
Or you saw my nick change.
when programers start talking
Where?
Well, no, not really, unless you count nick-change messages.
Haha

how to make the bleep 3:
did it bleep
yes, when you say someones name it bleeps
bleep
i get only beep when someone says beep Iks
Quit with the constant highlighting of a user's name
i think
Hot coffee can give you some pretty bad burns
XD
I know
tell me about it

just like ponies

oh wait, i'm thinking of flamethrowers
!hug
Hugtiem? :3
Ponies give you bad burns?
YES
<3
maybe ponies with flamethrowers do? i haven't checked
Then I have nothing to worry about.
Except flamethrowing poneis.

oh yeah, thanks :)
hello
any way night guys
isn't cheveaux hair
Later
i think that's cheveux
there was some sort of difference there...
none other than the spelling, I bet
hmhm
subjonctif never made sense to me
French never made sense to me
yeah, i know right?
most languages don't make much sense
i had to learn it from grade 4-8
grade 4-9, and another full three years in this other school I'm doing
i should have kept to languages, i think
i usually did pretty okay there
I'm biased, but it just feels redundant to me
countries that speak French: France
no one speaks french
oh.
and then there's the immigrants, they all speak their own language
why teach French when you could teach English or Spanish, you know?
why not educate the idiots that can't tell the difference between 'their' and 'there'
and they're'
and they're
=________=
there are worse things
hue hue hue
i hope that was purposeful
yeah
xD
hundreds
ooo

I suppose they are kind of oat cakes that are stuck together with some kind of syrup or something.
!pancakes
It's a kind of baked good made with oats, cereal, syrup and a few other things.
Those are American pancakes. :P
Ours are much flatter and bigger.
Yes.

Well the thing was she said her boyfriend already did....

Yes.
Pancakes are pancakes.
Do you have a word for our flapjacks.

THAT'S a biscuit in America?

Soda pop.
We just call them fizzy drinks.

We just ask for specific brands usually.
Same here...
Coke, sprite, lilt, pepsi, etc.
And yeah
Fanta! <3!
Wellp.
I broke that "Coke" habit. Now I say soda.

Likewise.
I was like
it is worse in latin spanish
I hate jello. Jam is good. Jelly is... I can't even remember the last time I had any.
Acta est fabula, plaudite.
Should introduce the Americans to Cockney Rhyming Slang, I think their heads would explode.
Because burro is butter in Italian and donkey in Spanish, IIRC.
Considering I don't know anyone IRL here that understands it.
Jello feels like it's writhing in pain inside my mouth.
burro is also yummy food
That would just be mean
XD
Tea-leaf on the roof!
Did you ever read that book?
Jam is great because it's got little bits of real fruit inside. Jelly is just...sugar.
It's a good book.

I think some people like marmalade.
/me blankstares Sketchy_Sounds.
It's good, has oranges.
Omigosh Hi everypony!!!
Lolwut @ FIreant link
there's pretty much nothing other than marmalade to get here
oh, that
Hello Self_in_socks!
i am framiliar with that
Where is it they only have marmalade, England?
LOL
lol wut
no, no, wait
People say 'burglarize' in the US?
i misunderstood something there.
Burglarize yes
i was talking about germany, since we call pretty much everything Marmelade
Hi, moony loony!
Fireant, best thing ever
Triximancer: In Britain we have marmalade but not exclusively.
XD
but apparently that's NOT marmalade. it's jam/jelly.
It's not made up, it's a real word
Oh I know
See to us, burgled (sp?) would sound weird
Well, downright silly, actually
hide yo kids hide yo wives
mmm
/me hungry.
I thought marmalade was another term for butter.
/me looks to Sketchy_Sounds, "Feed me."
You mean margarine.
Or is that like margarine or something
Uh, no
And that's not butter.
Margarine is like, soy oil or something
It's awful
XD
Marmelade over here is pretty much everything that's made from fruit that you're supposed to spread on a slice of bread
then again, there's also konfitüre.
i don't even know where the difference is.
Do you guys ever use 'lush' the way we do over the pond?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confit
Wow just realized.
!seen Revolver
Tiles: The last time I saw Revolver was Thu 01 Sep 2011 03:30:11 AM CEST
Lush as in drunk?
Sometimes it's used
well, that's not it
It's more of an old fashioned term though
lush forest
Marmelade and Konfitüre are pretty much the same thing, apparently
That'd be awesome. XD
Oh, you don't know the meaning of the slang?
probably depends on where you are, since we have about 20 million dialects here.
I've heard it used like that...to men drunkard.
As in "That girl is lush".
Yeah means drunk
Oh, lol
probably more like 20
Ahh.
You guys have a lot of squiffy slang after all
hmm we have lasch
Still, incorporate 'pomf' into English slang, would be a win.
it really sucks when people do that, DeniedExistenceMobile, but yeah, chances are that it's just someone being a real jerk
potzblitz.
pomf = onomatopoeia right?
Hench = never heard, except "henchman"

It's a joke in Florida.
I vaguely remembered seeing commercials for it on TV.
Scene kids?
guidos?
I always hear chavs as being people in Florida.
Those would be pretty much analagous, yes
They always wear hoodies, talk almsot completely in slang.
anyone watching the Misfits tv series from the UK?

Wear jeans really low down.
Oh, yeah.
Up here we call them neds.

Just because you have something else you call a flapjack doesn't mean it doesn't mean pancake over here.
