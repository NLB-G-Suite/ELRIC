Good to know that SOME people have his back.

03but I still feel bad as that's probably one of the worst words you can say on the radio..
02donno, bias words are worse
03actually
03the n-word and such
03are not even on the list of prohibited words
03you just aren't supposed to use them
02LOL really?
03look up George Carlin's "7 words you can't say on TV", that's basically the list.
03yeah.
03http://i.imgur.com/wvi2u.jpg
03Enjoy :P
03the ones at the top are the "bad" ones
02lmao
obtw
obtw
Wet back
today i went into an open home,
really.
LOLWUT
10That moment I remember the radio fails to censor swear words in some songs
10or it's done poorly
03yeah
03that's annoying
02wait, why is "Wet back" on there?
10and then the T in censored
03prolly considered racist
03but I don't care LOL
<censored> still
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 4 time(s).
hahaha
wait
wait
wha.
02what did you say?
I STILL FAIL TO SEE OF T*TS IS A REALLY BAD SWEAR WORD
03yeah same
<censored>
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 28 time(s).
03you can say boobs, just not that :P
boobies
tit
03inb4 bluetits (the bird)
Please do not swear. You have said a swear word 1 time(s).
02derp
03inb4² why are they blue, that's probably not good
/me runs

03OK stop killing the joke
03but yeah
they had an attic (my first time going into an attic)
03and those are *obvious* ones
03not ones that sound like other words
you could see the light fittings and they had a TV arial there
and they had a room in the attic
well, depenz on which server you're on
03XD
03the reason those two are circled
03I think, means "you can play songs with those words in them, just try not to say them yourself"
02ah
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX1wi3qsTbs <- why does this amuse me?
03well
03notice the word "my"
03even if you say suck my lollipop
03that's a bit suggestive
03:P
suck my brick?
03um
03no thanks
and if you're thirsty, you can try sucking rocks for moisture.

all dat talk about "feature parity"
03I LOL'd a bit a while back

notreally
neooffice is like a mac-optimized version of openffice
But if you were talking challenging then I would think Flandre

forgot the term for that derp
03FFS
03but I'm starting to feel sick LOL
03only got two slices left
don't eat it then
03yeah but I hate just throwing it out
03and refridgerated pizza is disgusting
stop atarbitrary amounts
2Fridgepizza is one of my favourite foods ever
03it just tastes a lot worse when you refridgerate it :/
recycle the carbon and allow CAM plants to survive in the winter
problem solved
:D
03so you'd actually order a pizza, refridgerate it and then eat it the next day? LOl
also fridge pizza isn't bad
you just wanna eat it relatively soon after you refridgerate it
03LOL pizza for breakfast
03my sisters do that
03they eat cold pizza for breakfast
03I'm like HOW
2It's delicious :D
03ew cold pizza :/
03and heating it up, well... re-heating any food tends to ruin it
2You're seriously the first person I've ever met that doesn't like fridgepizza
03wow
03well I like being a minority :PD
03*:D
2Lol
2That one's catchy
2I haven't heard it since before I moved to Tralee :o
2!pokemon
03...Wow
2Ew no
03some bands insist on being borderline inappropriate
2Shock value?
OL
2Lol yeah no
03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWYXIuuI-Rg
03and they call it "three double-D"
03LOL
03Vengaboys are legit but that song is like... eh
Ur-an-us as opposed to ur-an...yeah
I thought that joke died by third grade
03SING ALONG TIME
03and yes, radio version, because I hate swearing
03I had this shirt I bought at a NASA museum
03had all the planets
03I wore it to school once
03I'm like -_-, never wore it again
03well
03they were actually poking that spot on my shirt
03and it wasn't near my cro-I mean
03it was a bit annoying when people kept poking me
2Put a ferret under that spot, it would bite them every time
03LOL
inb4 I like milkshakes
03Yes, because I could totally find a ferret and keep it under my shirt all day
2Yeah :D
03but yeah
03and I'd rather get the GOOD kind of attention
03Yep
is always fun
03but calculators are allowed
03so
03Mario on calculators
2How does that even :O
03TI-83+ is rather limited
03-o
03people made games
03I had all of them
03still do XD
03but the kids liked me, and that's all that counts :P
2I can't comprehend that lol
2The games that is
03because my math teacher told her at conferences
03that I was giving everybody games
03and she was like "why do you do this stuff"
03XD
2Because it's fun :D
03yeah
03the sad thing is, in retrospect, I just got used by everybody
03I have very few *actual* friends from high school
03most of them were like GEE THANKS FOR THE GAMES *runs off and badmouths me to friends*
03well
03I linked it on IRC
03basically he hated me for some reason, thinking I was "that weird kid at band camp"
03which I was, being weird is awesome
2I was always the weird one lol
