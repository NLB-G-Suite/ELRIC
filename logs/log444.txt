otakon: I like how pissed he is.
"also, if you mess this up, we're putting you on the cross next."
Aw...
Darf14: much creepier in the show
Also, random limbs. Anime likes that stuff.
WallDives: what the HELL?
its like a plant person
it's on a cross . . . stupid symoblism. I need more beer
ohai #bronystate
K_A: it's worse in the anime
yeah, the show is more creepier
Hiya ekips
1,11God, the logic of this movie makes no fucking sense!
FlareChaser|Colgate: you made it sound more important than it was.
Silverscreen: huh?
i agree
otakon: True
I need more wheat beer
WallDives: damn :P
So this is, what, the THIRD time Shinji's had his "Waaaah, Saving people is hard!" crisis?
Shinji needs a brightslap.
Silverscreen what's logic?
Anime never made sense.
Silverscreen: makes more sense then Black Rock Shooter
together forever, no matter how long, from now until the end of time, so you can be sure that forever and a day, that's how long I'll stay, together and forever more (pokemon song)
This was meant as a pretty heavy-handed deconstruction of the entire mecha genre as it existed throughout the 1980s. The whole deconstruction of "Fell Into the Cockpit" is quite obvious for example
LOGIC FAILS ME
Anime makes sense?
It's time to FOIL that polygon's evil plan!
Shinji lives in that state of crisis.
DAT POSITRON
Fuck gravity.
00,10at least the shield is't the underbody of the space shuttle this time.

WallDives, Indeed
totally makes sense to put the emo in charge of shooting instead of the robot girl
Kandarihu: ah
Penetrate dat core
Arg, I've been speaking to much today. Got a sore thoght.

it was cooler as the space shuttle bottom

hew, new kid you can do it
I wonder if Shinji whining is a recurring theme, na thats stupid.
Kandarihu: eeyup
I was just saiyan
pen pen should be pilot number x
Japan is in stealth mode.
EggWhite: lol you're funny
pikorar: You have a dirty mind, tisk tisk
They added something good here.
I think Shinji's whining is a metaphor for him being a little bitch.
Oh wait...

Um, it's a positron cannon, not a laser

Oh gosh that's great
hiya ZappyTheUnicorn

EVA pilots need to go to Anthrocon to smile or something.
solar eclipse is going to occur on sunday at 8:00pm cst

Nyria: this is where commas come in.
positron = antimatter.

A positron = antimatter proton
Derpy_Hooves: interesting.
Well done indeed
http://www.memecreator.org/static/images/memes/163355.jpg panda there
if they are using the powerlines in place, all of that power going through it would either overload the system or short it out right?
He sure likes to hold that position
What are we watching today?
otakon: You do get shiped alot.
00,10fire all dakka
Om: yeah
Derpy_Hooves: It's the night I will have the most power!
ALL THE DAKKA!
Has he seen that yet?
the other thing too, is that positron cannon would be useless, positrons would anihilate against air's electrons.....
Ohly crap, Orions <3
throw the cheese!
Positron is the antimatter analog to an electron: e+. I think it's normally released by radiation?
otakon: XD but you didnt stop getting shipped ^^
Gee. Shinji has the power of AN ENTIRE FIRST WORLD COUNTRY'S ENTIRE POWER GRID at his hands. Maybe missing shouldn't matter all that much.

*INSERT COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 SOUND EFFECT HERE*

pikorar: Well it's not exactly an electron. Like you know how during beta decay, a neutron will let out a little thing that's effectively an electron? When a proton does that it's a positron.
Om: nope.

Well first he needs to find out that he's been getting a boner for his mother
Me helping you...
The lyrics had baka in and baka roughly translates to idiot i believe.
is there more of this?
Om: I hope they turn out good!!!!!! let me know
EggWhite: roughly, it has many different meanings.
and that hes been pushing his mother's buttons to save humanity
True.
Baka is indeed a term in japanese for idiot EggWhite

stallion1: Two more movies, and the original TV series and movie from 1996.

it is a general insult.

PrincessLuna: I will!
-_-
Whoofs: She just tried cutting off my hoof, not my cutie mark :$

That's KING PenPen.

The seas are blood? wat.
Turtles :|
Now the only thing left for decontamination is their souls
i still dont get why the water is red

Yeah, not enough oxygen. Probably too much iron.

Second Impact fucked up the oceans

iUgh, gag
00,10sealife is all but gone
Acleps: It's a person who gives people chemicals that knocks them out and makes them numb and stuff. It's a dangerous job because there's a large chance they could kill a person, but they get paid TONS.
flutterfan I'm guessing it has something to do with the "Second Impact"
panda: I like mturtles.
:'(
But fish are dumb...
oh

/me 08,01cannot read fast
watchu say?
It was, basically
Stupid principles.
ANTA BAK!?
08,01i see boobs
Yup
No Acleps, the anesthesiologists have to calculate how much of a chemical to give a person based on their weight and size.
-_-
1,3cannot read fast + is mod = does not compute
Asuka = best
Sumica red tide . . . that's caused by a type of algae? Or is it moss? Does moss grow in the ocean? Hah, I'm drunk
1,3:3
pikorar: Also, my english is really logical right now
you've done nothing wrong. BUT UR WRONG! FIGHT ME!
Don't eat pork! Not even with a fork! CAN'T TOUCH THIS.

Of course Asuka is irritating.

08,01kirz|vectors: i have the chat colour coded by user automatically
no its mai meat!
08,01otherwise, my eyes skip and jump
Acleps: They have to be able to mix the chemicals almost perfectly, and the chemicals can act very as harsh toxins in teh body if left unmixed.

dat was delicious!

Oh, and blood is dark, so plant life would have trouble with photosynthesis.

Ohai SuperBrony64 :3
Nope, just stating the obvious, nothing more
00,10it was Phase4 SuperBrony64
Allo SuperBrony64.
Fun Fact: The sky should be red because a lot of the blue of the sky comes from the reflection of the blue water on the atmosphere.
13from the original series, First Impact was what's its name hitting the Earth to spin off the Moon (thus all the moon imagery)
it was?
0,14dat SB

11,02Derp ^-^
Wondershy i have all kinds of alcohol...every...single...type...;)
The sky is blue due to light refraction.
13you maniacs!
That's the point Acleps. They could easily kill a person because some people don't react well to anesthesia.
what the . . holy shit
Hi SuperBrony64
Alright... going to eat my breakfast... for dinner! :D
whatcha watching?
PrincessLuna: hows dat whiskey?
Water is blue because it reflects the sky, not the other way around.
01,04I'm eating a cheeseburger o__o
08,01DocSane: actually, water is blue
Irish_Pony|Blind Okay! :)
woah

Clean ice is actually blueish.
04QUESTION
Water is blue because of its physical properties, not its environment, unless there is no blue wavelength light around o.o
11,02Irish_Pony|Blind: Nothing :3
1,3SB's a cannibal!
13DeadpoolDash: nope the impacts are so called cause they're much bigger deals than that
13First Impact created the Moon

most of us are talking in the skype chat right now, so its dead here
08,01DrunkenGirl159: water has an intrinsic light blue/turqoise colour too, because it weakly absorbs red light
User0: I live next to the ocean. I can assure you, water is not blue.
It's not just math Acleps, it's how the chemical react with each other and with the body. You would have to get a knack for biology and chemistry. Some people have allergies, some people have certain injuries that react badly to anesthesia...

Acleps, documentaries.

Tne destroyer is the easiest one.

Terraria SuperBrony64
Also make sure to get the Ankle, to double your life.

I haven't played vidya in like a month.
Asuka: "But I'm German! I never played baseball like you crazy Japanese!"
Ghosties, just level grind until 2035, and then try, guaranteed.
11,01Go Asuka.
The Ankle, or what's it called, doubles your invul time after getting a hit.
I have no idea what game that's even about XD
Acleps: Unfortunately alot of the stuff I learn is fake... I regret to admit.
It's a Cross thingie.
ha! small amounts
SuperBrony64, that was my first thought too
Asuka.
We all hate you.
time to run fast
Also, cross.
pikorar: Fake? How?
And now, let's defy some physics
Asuka is hot
13they haven't developed asuka enough at this point to explain her psychological issues
i assume its actualy diablo though
04In order to get the Flamethrower I need to have defeated Skeletron Prime. No fucking way I'm going after him the way I am now
Unicorn_Gundam: Yes, but she's also a total bitch.
she has alot of issues
I hope when they do it makes me hate her less.
13the original series explanation is completely out since she's friends with THE DOLL
did the red bitch die yet?
Acleps: I just have huge volumes of false information in my brain from stuff I hear from unreliable resources, Acleps.
08,01is that a giant mech?
Because so far I want to slam her face in a door.
Asuka has the powers of red hair and tsundere personality
/me have no idea how to use skype group thingy
my computer won't load up google.com....

Shizuka who's your second-favorite pony?
Shizuka: we don't hate her, she's just a overbearing ego centric know it all
08,01DrunkenGirl159: it's cool; at least you're not a chicken

Shizuka, only because she is being a bitch right now.. :<

03it just tastes a lot worse when you refridgerate it :/
recycle the carbon and allow CAM plants to survive in the winter
problem solved
:D
03LOL what?
2I honestly think it tastes better <3
03so you'd actually order a pizza, refridgerate it and then eat it the next day? LOl
also fridge pizza isn't bad
you just wanna eat it relatively soon after you refridgerate it
2No, I do eat what I can while it's fresh but always save a couple of slices for breakfast
03Hungry Howie's just tastes gross to me if it's not fresh
03LOL pizza for breakfast
03my sisters do that

03see, high schoolers are so immature
03I had this shirt I bought at a NASA museum
03that I was super proud of
03had all the planets
03I wore it to school once
03the entire day I got prodded by kids going LOL I SEE URANUS HAHAHA
03I'm like -_-, never wore it again
2I'd totally wear it everyday
03well
03they were actually poking that spot on my shirt
03and it wasn't near my cro-I mean
03it was a bit annoying when people kept poking me
2Put a ferret under that spot, it would bite them every time
03LOL
inb4 I like milkshakes
03Yes, because I could totally find a ferret and keep it under my shirt all day
2Yeah :D
03but yeah
03this was back when I was a social outcast (well, I still am)
03and I'd rather get the GOOD kind of attention
03than people just going LOL YOUR SHIRT IS EMBARRASING
03so, I became known as that kid who gave everybody TI-83+ calculator games, as well as getting around the school filters
2Calculator games what
03Yep
pokemon stadium on a calculator
03I took my DS around, but some teachers got mad if I was playing Mario Kart in class
is always fun
03but calculators are allowed
03so
03Mario on calculators
03LOL what?
03we didn't have that fancy stuff
2How does that even :O
03TI-83+ is rather limited
03black and white graphics
03about the same as the original Game Booy
03-o
03people made games
03ZTris was one of the best, it's a tetris clone
03and Phoenix was a galaga-like thing
03I had all of them
03still do XD
03teachers hated me so much
03but the kids liked me, and that's all that counts :P
2I can't comprehend that lol
2The games that is
03my mom got mad
03because my math teacher told her at conferences
03that I was giving everybody games
03and she was like "why do you do this stuff"
03XD
2Because it's fun :D
03yeah
03the sad thing is, in retrospect, I just got used by everybody
03I have very few *actual* friends from high school
03most of them were like GEE THANKS FOR THE GAMES *runs off and badmouths me to friends*
03but I was (and probably still am to a point) too desperate for people to notice the fact that I exist, so I went along with it :|
03...which reminds me of this time I actually got Articuno to join me in making a kid feel bad for harassing me online :D
2Calling in the white knights xD
03well
03I linked it on IRC
2Cereal or noodles D:
03Luckily he took the page down after my mom noticed it, but I saved a copy
03basically he hated me for some reason, thinking I was "that weird kid at band camp"
03which I was, being weird is awesome
2I was always the weird one lol
03that's what he wrote
2Then evolved into the rebel when I dropped out lol
03I blurred out my last name as I was a bit paranoid back then
03and nobody comment on the fact that I'm using IE6
03I was like 14, deal with it

03something like that
2Yeah I remember
2It's still like that but has mellowed of cours
2Course*
03yeah
03well, he left the page up until about a year ago
03and my mom was googling my name to see what came up
03and that was one of the first results
03she was like "did you know about this?" and I was like "of course I did, I wrote back"
03and she's like "You do realize that if you apply for a job, people cna google you and that just makes you look bad"
03so she called the guy's parents lik e"can you tell your son to get rid of that?"
03I was like >_> <_< I can take care of myself mom
03but whatever XD
2Do potential employers really care about what high-schoolers say lol
03prolly not
03but they'd ask I guess
03she's paranoid
03she thinks you all are rapists :D
whee
03wait crap
03I lost the picture I took of Arti's and my reply
03I think I saved the page itself though

2I do not hear music when I hear Skrillex
03I like techno, but dubstep sounds more like dummied-down techno

How to make dubstep- 1. Take a decent song by somebody else
2. Add 1/3 techno, 1/3 extremely unequalised sound and 1/3 random sine waves

and 8GB for linux's swap crap

i do admit that updating seemed slow
earlier
i thought it was just the connection last night
since my friend was complaining about runescape being laggy
Same
so he reset the router
and that killed the connection
._.
we couldn't get internet access after that XD
haha
PPP connection kept timing out
doing some tests
i got the router to say that the ATM connection was failing
which i never heard of that term before so yeah
...lolwut ATM connection
not sure if it's really a connection
can't tell by the little research i did on it

this was before his shield was made by nokia

Ninjazz about what?
Nittany_Discord: he's nothing more then a publicity stunt
Morchok is down?
Good work!
Gratz Wrek.
captain is a good drafter.. :)
How ...Weimar-esque of those U.S. soldiers.
Adamantium is shitty knockoff of Vibranium
Well, he gets shot up with God knows what. And they treat him like a prop or something.
PVP is where it's at however.
11,01That's a waste of fancy chemicals.
Nittany_Discord, I wish I knew. Why don't they send him to fight, they modified him to do just that, didn't they?
He needs a dimondium sheild.
I'd be the monkey
RAWRity: the HELL you say, Admantium is friggin UNBREAKABLE dammit
he is both
RAWRity Oh my, no.
lol
I liek monkies ^^
We're all monkeys on the inside...
Floris: no, that's Spiderman
unless a more fun option is available?
11,01We spent millions on a propaganda program.
otakon: So is vibranium.
Floris: Agreed
fun fact: nokias are made of adamantium
Floris: no. Just no
If only they got Nintendium...
fuck yeah Floris, homosexuality is manly as hell
Captain Homosexuala? Doesn't work.
pikorar: You're a monkey on the inside. ;)
otakon: Why do you keep saying 'the hell you say'?
Nitram: he was the only one to be made
Nittany_Discord: Never thought of it that way
pikorar i guess on the inside I have organs
ScootaChicken: bc I like saying that
Hydra spies tried to steal fancy chemicals that create icons
otakon: actually, it's not. Adamantium, in canon, is the closest thing humanity's come to synthesizing vibranium.
needs moar Phoenix.
:D
14I hate how all different phone companies got a different keynumber for space xDD
What's the difference between Vibranium and Acoustium?
He just want to fight in the war. He wants to help.
otakon: It doesn't even make sense, it's like 'I could care less'.
one million monkeys
Organs, Invi? You chould get that checked out by a doctor... That soudns dangerous.
O.o...I can do faces....

It's actually established in the comics that Wolverine can't cut through Cap's sheild.
;d
1,11The 107th Infantry is a lesser known Army unit, so lesser know that typing it in Wikipedia won't even direct you to the unit's page under its better known name, The 7th Regiment of New York, a unit that did serve in WWI.
two million monkeys
:F
RAWRity: but all vibranium does is vibrate, it's not unbreakable
so yeah, Vibranium>Adamantium
otakon: Cap's vibranium shield can sustain a blow from Thor's hammer. >_> Adamantium is a vibranium synthetic
And, yes.. Technically it is the manliest since it are two men.
NERD MODE: capts shield is made of an unknown combination of steel and vibranium
Give me Barnes..... James Barnes...
hey Sumica are we gonna have a marvel marathon this summer?
but in this movie it is just vibranium
Captain Amareica is best Marvel movie
0,14it can't take a shot from the Serpent's hammer though, CK|Ded
11,01Great mission!
CK|Ded: Cap's Shield is Vibranium/Adamantium mix you know? It has the quality of both metals and is near indestructable
I like Cap'
Captain Mexico.

Let's not have a Marvel Marathon until the Avengers comes out on home video.
adamantium is the attemted copy of caps shield
Only 3 times in almost one hundred years?
Saxy: Yeah, usually as a stunt by Marvel to make the enemy seem threatening. :p
1,11Jones is an awesome actor.
cap's shield didnt protect him from being assassinated.
SaxyPretender something like that
where is the super shield?
catain mexico is worst captain
Try cyanide, alcohol, and cigarettes, Invi, that should speed things up alot.
Silverscreen^
Sumica I think Rasputin would know that if he weren't so dead
Heh.
usually by cosmic powers though; Thanos with infinity gauntlet, thor with odin power...
lets watch thor next
Space: be patient
Space Stark has to invent it still
hey
he gts the better shield later
THE OLD GUY IS AGENT K
Shit might have just got real.
One does not simply walk to Austria

Kandarihu stole my wait-for-avangers comment
Woah, cliché scene.

1,11Red Skull's deformed appearance is explained by his body's rejection of the serum because he was not worthy - the serum drives him even madder. This is exactly what happens to Emil Blonsky which leads to his transformation into the Abomination, with the help of gamma rays, in The Incredible Hulk.
"The Red Skull's got no nose!" "How does he smell?" "...awful."
Don't walk over it! Crawl!
WHAT? Savedy by railings?

Well, at least there's still Hitchhikers guide for Galaxy to look forward to... (I actually havent seen it yet)

hiya Chrysalis you missed most of the movie sadly
1,11This isn't the first time a key part in a person's plot to overthrow Adolf Hitler was named Valkyrie (although the pony in question this time had an evil motive, unlike the real life and movie version.). This doubles as a reference to the fact that Skull is using power from an Asgardian artifact. And for a bonus reference, the Valkyries' job in Norse mythology was to choose who lived
1,11and who died in battle, rather fitting for a plane designed to bomb the entire planet.
Such a fucking retarded salute... >_<
maybe on the wings of valkyiretards.

I'm kinda glad i stayd away of the stream during the movie, on one hand i can't stand too see the all this Scy Fi-Stuff in WW2 Movies becvause "Superior Nazi Sience" and on the other hand some rather disgracfull argumentsnin the chat about various things...

Then they died
Damn that HP, turning every nosely character in existance to be called Voldemort

Showdown
11,01Pink?
inb4 good line
1,11Lil_B: All Germans Are Nazis: Surprisingly and gratifyingly averted, for ONCE. They actually only mention Nazis/Hitler a few times, and the conflict between Captain Amareica and HYDRA (who break away from the Nazis early in the film) is really only set in the 1940s, but the actual War is pretty much ignored. This trope is outright defied by Dr. Erskine, who claims that Germany was the
1,11first country to be invaded by and fall victim to the Nazis (something that he also notes is what many ponies tend to forget).
Irish_Pony|Blind: Very. :)
hey MI9000 hows your day been
