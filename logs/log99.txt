Looks like a server went down
inb4 netsplit
Except I haven't experienced winds that powerful ever since.
Where it would rock a car.
BRING IT ON!!
Yeah
I see no netsplit
Guess there's no netsplit then
OK you ponys have to keep in contact somehow so the rest of us ponys know you are ok
14Sounds kinda scarey but exciting.
The quit message would've said the server.
It won't be bad for me...
Yeah. Solidified my love of weather and got me interested in severe weather.
Or a tornado.
ibilis redirected me, and it seems to have went boom
i was on rubicon
I remember when storm chasing was still getting started. I wanted to do that.
I loved it when I found out others loved severe weather and went after it.
14Yeah, I want to storm chase kinda too.
I've done it three times.
Well, 4.
14Nice.
14None for me. lol
3 in KS, OK, and TX. Once in MN.
So who hasn't seen this?
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk
Twilight told me this video is about Portal: No Escape
Last year, I rode with experienced chasers. Helped a lot.
14I've not seen anything much where I'm living in TX yet. Some strong downpours acouple times, but nothing as big as some of the ones I saw in NY
I sure haven't
TX is in a drought.
14Yeah, friend told me about that.
It's really good.
14I'm in the greener part, way way on the east side, almost in LA
Ahh.
You know...
So not in the super-dry West TX.
What would everyone here like to do most?
14I did live there for a little. Sucked big time.
I've been as far south as right along the Red River valley.
And as far west as Amarillo, TX.
uh
14Furthest west I've been is Cali. lol
I really liked exploring the plains during my first plains chase.
that question is far too ambiguous
14Driven through the plains. Was nice. Though a little boring. :P
I have no desire to live in Cali or anything west of the Rockies.
You're right...
I loved the plains when I first saw them.
14I would live in some parts of Cali
/me punches the wall
/me will BRB as he's hungry
Somehow this wall holds up
14Speaking of the Rockies, I also lived at about 9000ft in CO lol
Living in forested mountains for all my life made the plains look awesomely-fresh.
You've been all over.
14Mhmmm
I've only lived in SC and PA.
I plan on moving out to the plains.
Either OK or MN.
14I've lived in Germany, NY, TX, NC, GA, CO, NE
I would like to draw an awesome animated fan tribute to past sins... But man... I've never made a cartoon as long or as good as this one would have to be.
14Think thats all. lol
Wow.
Must be the fourth wall. Quick! Summon Pinkie Pie!
Well I tell you I would go back in time and go to watch this show:

I might want to drive around PA some more before I leave.
14Oh yeah, forgot Arkansas too, lamo
14PA is decent
I visited Centralia, PA during my first year of stay.
I'll be surprised if that town still exists anymore.
It has a population less than this channel's member count right now.
14No idea where that is. I'd mainly been to Philly and Pitsburgh
14:P
14Yay small towns!
It's a nearly-dead town. Used to be big until they accidentally started a mine fire that's still burning today.
14That sounds familiar.
14Heard about that somewhere of some town. Might have been that one.
Might have seen it in a movie with Chevy Chase and Dan Akroyd.
Even though that town was fake.
14Well, I remember seeing it on some news somewhere a while back.
But it was based on Centralia.
So was the town in Silent Hill.
At least the premise.
!seen Donitz
Shaico: Silly filly, your eyes are all derpy. Donitz is in the channel.
I don't know if Centralia would make the news nowadays unless it finally loses it's borough status.
I guess I killed the chat....
QUIT I've recieved a new mission assignment.
14Dunno.
mmmmmm coffeee
At that point, the PA govt. will take it over and mine the coal out.
14Just remember hearing about a town with that in the news a while back.
I don't know of any other towns with long-lasting mine fires.
Of course, I didn't know about Centralia for a long time.
14The name sounds familiar though, so it may have been that.
mmmmm coffee and chocolate
/me leaves due to killing the chat...
Wow, Askpinkamina is rough this update
Yup.
I loved it.
oh yes I do to
WOW.
That's... wow. Did not expect that.
I wish I knew who the artist is
What...?

Twilight told me this picture is about yes twilight_sparkle season_2
this is the third version and the lack of anti-aliasing on the YES! still kills me
So
I just talked my friend into covering his stepdad's car in pony stickers
:S
well howdy gents
yes, that's a pretty lazy job lol
Because his stepdad is attempting to find a therapist to "cure" his Brony-ism.
oookay, well, that's bad, but so is covering a car in stickers
never realised how yellow that picture is
ah, everyone is afk. I'm assuming that everyone has parted ways :P
oh well, I'll be back tomorrow :P
Okay, that's... No therapist worth their diploma would touch that.
I'm here. Just occupied.
covering a car in stickers is not the way of love and tolerance :P
@Xiagu: Gotta agree with that, tho.
lol
I feel like eating a begal
BUT WE HAVE TO CREAM CHEESE
Pyroh, *bagel *no
no*
yes my keyboard is horrible
paint Celestia on the passenger side window of the car >_>
Okay, so, actually he declined that.
Good for him
Now we're talking about putting random pony stickers around the house.
Hurr.
stupid internet.
Can't wait for september to start up.
New internet.

Still trying to find out if this is real or not. Apprently some guy legally changed his name to rainbow dash

That's a bit... wow, taking things too far.

most people wouldn't care about middle names that much
yeah middle names are fine
I've used mine like, 5 times total in my life time
when was the last time you had to write more than your middle initial?
:D I accidentally changed my middle name once.

I want to change my middle name to "Awesome"
So I can legitly say "Yea, awesome's my middle name!"
I want to change my name to Danger.
I'd like to erase my middle name and just have first and last lol
@Retsamoreh: Technically all you have to do is just go to the Soc. Security office.
"No, Danger's my MIDDLE name."</Austinpowers>
Or maybe I should change it to "adventure".
hum... what to do now... read more Hoenshy before I go to bed... or something else
You guys are helping me procrastinate.
How is Hoenshy?
Does that make you feel good?
I haven't touched it yet.
Retsamoreh, Efreet, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change#United_States
I'm enjoying it so far
And never read Hoenshy before.
I'm on Chapter 4 atm
I'm Australian. All I need to do is go on an epic quest and vanquish 20 Trapdoor spiders.
I'm not stupid enough to actually change my name though.
I mean, in the US, changing your name is a pretty sucky process.
makes me wonder what would happen if they ran into a ponyta/rapidash or that new zebra pokemon though lol
it took me 80$ and 30 minutes
?
I know, right?
I want to change my name
First comment = Lol'd
I was told it's $350
It took me $10 and about the same amount of time, but it wasn't a deliberate name change. :P
If I ever really feel for it, I may change my first name to my middle name. I like it better.
Octavia, why'd you change your name?
depends on the state you were born in, etc..
because i did not like my middle name
Eh.
Anyways. I probably won't change my middle name in the end.
I recently got a new ID
i kept my last name, changes first and middle
they put my first, middle, and the first half of my last name in the First Name field
and the second half of my last name in the Last Name field
Stupid family tradition dictates the father has to use his first name as his firstborn son's middle name.
Hahaha.
My mom once accidently crammed my whole name into my last name in an airplane ticket.
I quite like my name.
And I'm the only male left that has the family name, so I can't change my last name at risk of ending the entire family name.
Didn't know until security told me it didn't match.
So I literally am stuck.
stupid sexist traditions
I like my name as well.
Hows'it sexist?
…wait, I'm still ^BlacklightShining?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mCojSVaji4
I'm good with my first name. I just like my middle better and would like to be called by that.
so who wants to take a guess at my initials.
I mean, it's not really that sexist.
[21:37] Retsamoreh: And I'm the only male left that has the family name, so I can't change my last name at risk of ending the entire family name.
>implying that your family follows the husband's-last-name-overwrites-wife's-last-name tradition
I'll start you off.

o rly?
FRT?
how is that not sexist?
Is this the place that they're showing Lord of the Rings/Ponies?
.. :C
EF
TxP = One letter off.
Yes
It'll depend on my wife, I suppose.
S&M? Wait, no, M is three off.
you get 25 guesses!(inb4nooneguesses)
i love how my little pony ad's are poping up on daily site xD;
If I love her and she wants us to use her last name, I'll let her.
TQ
if i get married, my last name gets hyphenated
hnnngh >:I
Tenaris: on Equestria Daily?
My name is TJP.
Well, Initials.
My bad. I just realized that it's Friday morning right now, not Friday evening. Sorry about that.
if I get married, I'm taking my wife's last name
BlacklightShining: eyup
we will be watching that in 18 hours. hope to see you there
Octavia: One of my cross country friends had that happen to his last name.
because the second half sucks and the first half is borrowed from a bunch of generations ago
yeah, my girlfriend is mexican and thats how they do it
its atcually funny
/me 's last name = meh
He got made fun of for it cause it was quite long.
Thanks
Mines AS, i need a middle name starting with S

Twin James Quarry
oh joy
My mom used my dad's last name because hers was German, and at the time there was a lot of animosity towards the Germans, at least where they lived.
Make me a middle name.
James Quarry sounds like a rough draft name for an "over the edge cop" movie.
.. Lol.
BlacklightShining: odds are it wont appear all the time
What's this about Twin James Quarry?
My full name's Thomas James Perry.

I've had it butchered in real life.

yeah, I dunno how I got up to 2100 lines
sure doesn't feel like I talk that much
=O
16 makes me sad, I wanna hug Zecora now
if you stick around long enough...
Anyone ever watch the brilliant move "The Game"?
fffFFFFFFUUUUUUUU~
No, it's a real movie.
And it's freakin brilliant.
/me was drugged and left for dead in Mexico, and all he got was this lousy T-Shirt.
I love that movie.
25 makes me laugh lol
Indeed.
number 5 is so cute. Not a fan of the shipping, but so cute anyway

Snails is a real colt lol
Anyone play the awesome game "Thug Aim"?
Its so awesome, it makes me want to say it 10 times as fast as I can
5 doesn't look like shipping too much
more like playful between pinkie and rainbow, but that's just my opinion
25 I can imagine being a daydream scene in Season 2.
He will cut you
With that knife
and it will hurt
I like 7 and 12 alot
12 is really nice, scenery that looks really well done
NyanCatxRainbowDash
I wanna hug dat Zecora, she looks like she needs one =3
I'm liking 12 and 13 but for some reason I looked again and the shadow of Oct's chin makes it look like a muppet mouth. Now I can't unsee it.
So, what's the deal with 22?
13 is a cool Octavia pic too
23 is hilarious.
Not enough sweater dresses..
I always approve of Octivia, unless there's shipping involed
22 was a request
"Celestia's battle for the sixth Element of Harmony the first time Nightmare Moon rose up. I'm not sure I agree entirely with the story, but I couldn't resist the challenge."
We all cave to some shipping eventually.
if you check the source
@MrMooMoo: And only one legwarmer. :(
i can not have love?
NEVER
i am sad.
But still funny.
I caved into twixie shipping

I feel like I should know what's up with that Rarity
wut's happening to her
D:
every luna picture just makes me want Season 2 more lol
but it escapes me....
I swear, that is some reference to a thing.
What is her expression?
What is Luna thinking?
I can't tell if she is being turned to stone or using magic
2... is kind of scary lol
Rarity looks like she's turning to diamond
I knew her destiny was a rock.
Shes like Zelgadis from Slayers.
i actually didn't realize that was rarity for somreason
She's now a golem and her gemskin grants her super armor to attacks.
he he he. Clearly it should be "Pony of Persia"
SUPER ARMMOR
RRRRRRRGGGGGG
Can't think of Prince of Persia anymore without Nolan North.
And then there's good ol' Derpy doin it right again!
Nolan North pony, make it happen.
Rarity cast stone skin
Any drawfrinds here?
So like..
One could say.....

Whoa, haven't seen that in a while.
At least I have chicken.
Hey guys. My friend wants to chat with you guys.
Are you pondering that what was luna inside NMM manipulated things in some form so that NMM would cause the mane six to go though the required trials to form the friendship, so that Luna can be freed from NMM?
FRIEND
She is wondering what bronies are like.
Yeah, essentially, AlphaOmega
Bronies are cool.
Say, Shaico... Do you like bananas?
And random.
and ponies.
Shaico, just show her #sp :)
we're crazy and saturated in memes
Memetically Delicious!

Hey hey hey
what so good about mylittle poniess??
Vid appiclible to effet's words
Everything
Oh my
friendship, and magic
What a question to ask
Ponies is good about my little ponies.
Laren Faust
@Shaico's friend: Well, have you watched it?
it has a diverse cast whose personalities play off each other in interresting ways
Ninja ponies or Pirate ponies?
My little ponies has the most friendshippal magic anyone will ever see.
Lauren Faust, the fact it isn't "omg the conflict is that I need to get blue nail polish for the party"
Charactorization
The jokes are actually funny no matter your age group.
CUTENESS
Pinkie Pie.
Yeah, cuteness factors into it.
Incredibly great voice acting.
The fandom is awesome (most of it)
The show's first director actually had a vison, and she did all in her power to acomplish it
i like ninja ponies, they can sneak up
Snark. There's a lot of snarkiness in the characters.
Did she succed?
Twilights purple.
Fluttershy can make any man's spirit crumble into a mass of diabetes.
I think it is safe to say that most of us here wouldsay yes
We can claim that Twilight Sparkle is less gay than Twilight sparkles. :P
Come on what's better Ninja ponies or Pirate ponies?
The songs are great.
But intelligent reaons aside
oh really?
Neither, Coz.
the show makes me laugh something good
Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot Ponies are better.
Twilight Thparkleth is definitely the gayest.
Ponies>4chan
"Spike! There are no Zombie Ponies!"
Twilight Snarkle > all ponies
teenage mutant ninja ponies
AND HOW
so....
My friend is annoying.
...
no she awesome~
the Equestria tales game
Hello, Bronies
No Im confused
@Shaico: Is there a keyboard fight going on there?
Heh, when you ask the fan base why theyare fans, you're gonna get fan responses
Keyboard fight. Bang bang mash mash.
bad cereal bad!
Just getting exited for S2 -squeal-
*excited
Finger finger
0Way~
0Yay~
I know
Just like how if you ask haters why they hate, they gonna give you hate answers
I can hardly wait
Slap slap
I wonder what this "Discord" character will look like
O_o
What did cereal do this time?
And what his VA will be
Clop clop
0I dun-
Alright I'm back what I miss?
0Wait.
What is even goingon anymore?!?
Woaaah there.
0Crispin Freeman,
I was imitating a keyboard fight.
0That would be fucking epic
Oh my
sounds
Randomness, how addicting will mlp fim be in 5 years from now?
humm
I apologize, never heard him
Cocaine
And Imitated the end of the fight
Looking him up now, and I see only thumbs up
i still enjoy things from 20 years ago
How addictive!
and how many page views will the daily have by then xD;
It will probably die out. Depending on how it goes. But I myself will still love it.
Also, Twilight Sparkle's burning rage is awesome
0He's just known for giving over the top performances
That depends on how well they keep up the show's quality.
I think I'm gonna have to go to bed, I cannot read because I keep dozing off lol
Hey Toq
Dammit
0Check his work as Zetta in Makai Kingdom; that's my favorite
Torrent:
So, who here is part of another fandom?
Hey
I'm part of the MS Paint Adventures fandom.

Win,
man eversince i got into the ponies i havent been on 4chan in like ever
I ask 'cause, I'm kinda
!lullaby
Night
I agree.
fnight
It sounds so fitting
And yeah, an animated series getting even a SECOND season is fairly rare. I can see FiM getting... three seasons.
night spy
it sounds like season 2 has more funding
Gran Turismo fandom
new to this whole fanbase thing. How big is the pony fanbase?
so should be improved a bit
How u doin Torrent?
Millions.
Good
0http://youtu.be/VceqYerVw4s?t=1m13s
Millions
Like
I love the idea of stars as voice actors, anyhow.
Compared to other fandoms
Billion Views before season 5 xD
Do you think we'll ever get a Neil Patrick Harris pony.
*pony?
Depends on current fandoms of things.
I'd guess and say maybe 30-50k active members?
0Damn, I was tired, but now I'm excited.
wait, I'm supposed to be asleep
Yes
/me snores
6,957,916,297 people are fans of FiM.
good good
There are the timeless like video game franchises, Disney and Looney Tunes.
Just not all of them know it yet.
0Now it's my turn to play confused.
I am bored out of my mind now being at school.
we could make a town, a very strange town
Then there are the new ones like MLP
Cue Dash fangirl squeal.
a very awesome town
ummm hummm
very big town
What is it that is confusing you?
contniue
!seen ^Rarity
Paul_McColtney: The last time I saw ^Rarity was Fri 19 Aug 2011 10:32:38 AM CEST
There are actually more MLP fans than there are people on the planet.
I find that most people I can talk into watching it like the show.
0Dunno that guy's voice
Ik
Err i gotta sleep, theres a Senior Sunrise thing happening in my school tomorow
I've already found a handful of people that got halfway through the season then dropped it, couldn't care
oh
See, I was using a number that was an estimate of the current world population. XD
Just the idea of an extremely popular actor or actress
Cant miss it
gonna try and hold a mare-athon at my work on the 17th, when the new season starts... donno who will be up for 9 hours of season 1 tho lol
oh my
how many celeb's are bronies? i heard Bill clinton is a fan
Just an example
I can't wait for Season 2
wo
I hope we get Kevin McLeod
0Naw, they should keep it low key, so they don't have to pay anyone too big
0Case and point,
Vin Deasil likes it, he may not know he likes it yet though
Still
If I get ANYONE, it has to be Kevin McLeod.
Anypony doing a live stream? I don't have tv where I live, and I've no bronies near me to share the joy with
Well
The dude does play DND....
i know seth green is a fan
Any suprise ther?
can't wait for my first shirt to come fnally gonna have some pony swag
Seth Green was a fan before FiM
Still, Tara Strong is good enough for me
I want seth green to guest star in an episode
which makes it 20% cooler
that'd be so bad ass
his voice that is
She's amazing
0Oh yeah. She's...
weird al is a fan
Mad popular.
You'll have to start the Mare-athon on the 16th, Kadreal, since there will barely be 9 hours in the day before Season 2 starts, and that's on the East coast.
0"I could listen to her read the phonebook"
0Got that from another show
PG gents. Some us have sesitive eyes...
o_o
yeah lol
0Can only apply that to her
We don't have the hub
How did people know Weird Al was a fan?
nonstop 27 episode megathon starting at midnight on the 17th
I still don't get it.
Agreed.
so 9 hours for a decent upload
yes, yes, and more yes
5DANGER DANGER, high voltage! when we kiss, when we touch...
weird al posted about it on his twitter
Wait
Hey Wrek
Really?
he posted soemthing on his twitter
Like
Legit?
well, he liked the PMVs made with his music
He actually said that?
ya
Just discussing Season two and VAs.
5ohai
He would like to be a guest stae
he never said he was a 'brony' or that he directly like the show
0Yo wrek
Star
Ah
Actually, I though he'd made a pony reference before the PMVs.
0Hey, who do you think should be Discord's VA?
but he did say he really liked the pmvs
5*I am, the highlander*
Yeah, who?
Perhaps he wishes to reamin alooffor the time being
Al-Hoof? (Double pun all the way across the sky!)
5VA?
Voice Actor?
0Voice actor
5acronyms and I dont go well together
5ok
0I hear ya

It doesn't matter
Well i gotta sleep... Good night world.
nighty night
0Discord is probably gonna be male
i mgonna go have a nap

Night, MrMooMoo
for great justice
If a female can pull off a Cathy Weseluck, it works too.
may Luna guide your dreams
im still hoping to find a season 2 stream because i heard streams for s1 were decently fun
Good night cow, jumping over the MrMooMoo.
5if you dont know who it is ill pull up a voice clip
FOR GREAT JUSTICE!
im sure there will be s2 streams
I looked him up
I've seen it before, refreshing my memory.
yeah how do those work?
/me will try to dream about sweater dresses, and ponies...
So, nopony here is doing a stream then?
I heard there are threads on ponychan before each episode with links to stream
If not black market ponies will grow abundantly
So many people can pull off an evil voice, but only one is fit for the season two pilot.
even if there arent im pretty sure they'll be online within 105 seconds of airing anyway
I don't know too much about how streaming works...
You mean
Tony Jay. Too bad bad he's dead.
within
10 seconds flat
take longer than 105 seconds, encoding and uploading takes time
:'(
0Honestly, I think we need to know more about Discord
We do
i know just making a point :P

i'm gonna call it a night
g'night
What are you going to call a night?
Jen-enemy, signing off
it
ohhhhh
0Dash salute
so we replace the word it with the word night
I'm pretty sure if you keep calling Nightmare Moon an "it," she's going to banish you.
itmare moon?
Tired, but Luna's giving me the heebie jeebies
Not so intimidating anymore
I don't wanna bother Celestia and my neighbors by raising the sun in the middle of the night
Y'knoe?
but if you do a sentance that usualy used the word "It" but replace it with the word "night"
Not so intimidating?! Now I expect to see a clown pony lurking in the sewers of a small Maine town, murdering foals.
omg
I'm glad I don't live in main
maine*
I do
seen any clowns lately?
Hopefully you are not a foal.
according to Stephen King, Maine is a bad place to live;.....
...
Tell me about we have killer mist clowns you name it
*about it
Kingdom hospital
oh ya one the funner ones we got
Stephen King takes "write what you know" to heart a little too much at time, what with all the terrible things happening in Maine and happening to authors and what have you.
not to mention being hit by cars
or was it a SUV or Van or something that he was hit by
it is funny in Misery when they wonder if reading the author's books will give a clue to his fate
While I'm near 30 and don't have a licence not because I'm scared of cars, but because I'm scared of the stupid people in those cars.
Welcome back from the musical musicness Octavia
I 'm 16 and don't my license (trys to fit in)
Spin You are a brony, you already fit in
thank you, AlphaOmega.
You are welcome Octavia
That is the reason why bronies are awesome
/me has had a license since she was 15.
Why, exactly, are bronies awesome, Spin?

I have a learners. I've had the learners for about 10 years now. I actually had to renew my learners. Kinda ridiculous, right?
yes
I've had mine for several months, nothing too weird
Learners makes a good ID card
it does, yes
But not for passports
I learned that the hard way
Yeah, when I had to renew it, I was thinking of just getting the non-license government-issued ID, but the cost to renew the learners was the same, so I was like, eh, why not?
Getting passports for me is annoying cos I have to do it though an embassy
You want annoying? Lose your passport in another country. That was annoying.
OK not done that.... I just had it expire in another country
I live in Aussie, but I am considered a special visa case not a perminant visa case
Luckily, the other country was just the States, so it wasn't too bad, but still.
I assume you're from Canada, Discord?
You assume correctly.
I'd like to visit Canada someday. Seems like a nice place.
I wonder what they were thinking aboot when they made milkbags, eh?
milkbags?
I have never seen a bag of milk in my life. I have no idea where that idea comes from.
Well, I inferred that, as you didn't consider leaving your passport in the US that bad, it would have to be on the continent.
I buy milk in jugs or cartons.
And your English is too good to reasonably guess that you're from Mexico.
The only thing I associate with Canada is the bacon and Hockey and well the bacon pissed me off. Hockeys okay
Well he could be from the UK
You know what we call what you call Canadian bacon? Ham.
Ya I remember ordering pizza asking for bacon and got pissed when it came
He already said he was canadian
Ya I didn't see you say the thing about the same continent
I don't think I was here.
Yeah, a UK citizen losing their passport in the States would be in a bigger heap of trouble.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyTlVIaOEjU
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
When I lost my passport, we'd only actually needed passports for the States for a couple years. We used to not need a passport to travel to the US.
Twilight told me this video is about High Charity Suite
halo 2 soundtrack, anyone?
<_<
Currently listening bringing back good memories
Played that game so many times
I didn't play it much in its peak, but I have also played it so many times
night all...adrenaline high from almost beating another Touhou coming down...crash and burrrrrrrn
I never actually owned an Xbox until relatively recently, a 360 even more recently, and Xbox Live more recently than that
but that was a great game
Ya I replayed this game so many times cause I was too poor to get the 360 or halo 3 so I would just spend all my time on campaign
I'm going to bed I'll be on tommorrow

There's not that much wheat in the universe if we're talking about Derpy, Vexed.
I -think- a filly that looks like her appeared in one episode.
Radimir lol
and is a unicorn strangely enough
I always thought she was a fanmade pony
I demand source
I demand sauce
http://pictures.mastermarf.com/blog/2008/081208-box-of-rape.jpg
What sauce goes well with Vexed?
Mayo.
lolwut Sketchy
mayo is not a sauce
and mayo is disgusting...
Hullo
hi there
'ello there Bill!
I just thought what would be a great musical theatre song for MLP to do a song based off of
Rocky Horror
Think more Sondheim
"Sunday"
/me stares blankly.
You know Rarity's song in "Suited For Success?"
That was based off of a song from the musical "Sunday in the Park with George"
That song is about 20% cooler than Rarity's other song.
Well, that musical has another song in it called "Sunday," and it's really, really good.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVO9rN5Bk1A
u gonna PMV it?
No, but it'd be cool if the show wrote a song based off of it like Rarity's song or the Gala song.
Both of those songs were based off of Sondheim pieces.
anyway I've gotta go everypony
later
Off to bed as well. But first.

Now.... back to ponies...
tab me if anything
hmm
DA MAGICKS
Well
I know that there's a trick that lawyers do when it comes to collecting settlements from piracy lawsuits
IPs collected from torrent networks, like The Pirate Bay are often padded with fake IP addresses to prevent people from using it as evidence in court against anyone
And giving people plausible deniability
Episode 8: Look Before you Sleep
I like this one :3
Going to sleep, good night, ttyl.
Night.
But basically what the lawyers do to get around this is to send scary letters to all the IPs harvested .... they know they can't win in court but they hope that a small fraction of people will agree to settle for a couple thousand
Guest81622, so, basically, the short answer is: Yes, I think they're bluffing
Im not going to say anything
if they send me to collections i dont care
what will collections do? nothing
Guys
Ja?
it will cost them more to send it there then they will get
Ya?
plus i will never buy from them again

Nah, but, pull out his ethernet cable or something.
you know really sucks when you are playing TF2? damn modem shuts down
They're hoping you're gullable enough to be scared by an authority
I wouldn't worry about it
Loll
I rarely get that problem

im not :P
But the only thing thats different now is that im 18

To Efreet?
Baha.
auuuugh
I want september to come around already.
:C
Yep.
At least QCS will be over.
Hey. Radimir.
Guess what!
wat
I never got exams this year.
or ever.
u jelly?
Ja.
;3
I got a.. Math's assignment this week..
Then another test, then another assignment sometime later on.
oh god.
Once those three are finished. I've finished Maths for the year.
I have both QCS AND major block exams in the next two weeks.
These are pretty much the last set of exams that actually matter, too.
harharhar
Well. The only "Exam" I'm having is a Food Tech one..
But I don't really care for it.
I only had two options to pick from. Food Tech or D&T
D&T = Design and Tech, right?
Yeah.
I'm horrible at both.
Lots of assignments due for it, though.
haha
Particularly since I actually tried this year.
Since I have a very.. weird personality that imagines the worst things happening to me while I do the practical stuff.
"I'm cooking what now?.. Oh god damn it."
end up imagining my fingers sprawled over a cutting board.
and me running around the room screaming.
:<
I don't really get that in tech.
I'm more concerned about the material getting stuck and sent flying or somethng.
Don't get me started on D&T. Last time I had it, I imagined I'd end up cutting off my own hand with the jigsaw
D:
Also. Listening to MK theme.
The jigsaw is a PoS.
You have to grip is really hard to prevent it from just going everywhere.
So. Radimir. What is the thing you're looking forward to for the rest of the year?
Well, Day, I should say.
Hmm.
I would say...
November 18.
November 11th here.
What happens then?
Skyriiiiiiiiiiim
Still Don't know what my first character's going to be.
Ooh
Thinking Imperial.
I'm probably gonna go
Argonian
Argonians look sexy.
If the race perks are anywhere near what they were in Oblivion
...
Efreet..
I agree
From the screenies. They look awesome compared to Oblivion.
Gonna have to ask my Dad/Sister to take me up to Geraldton to get it from EBGames.
On the way up to Geraldton, I'll be giddy.
Yeah
On the way back, I'll be Pinkie Pie.
Most of the races look much better this time
Particularly the orcs.
Radimir.
2nd character shall be a Nord.
Blonde hair.
Blue eyes.
Hammer in one hand.
Lightning spell in the other.
Guess his name.
Thor?
hi5
/me high fives Radimir
/me returns this.
;D
>already know 2nd character
Apparently
>but not my first character.
There's also going to be same-sex marriage in it.
hey people
do me a favor
This raises the question: Why is there marriage in the Elder Scrolls?
if you get a chance to use an AT&T service
http://arch.413chan.net/2797_-_derpy_hooves-(n1301378919270).jpg
d'aww ^
and you can you ANY other service
Radimir.
don't use AT&T
for me :)
I'm going to totally..
Go into a tavern, make everyone end up drinking so much they pass out.
THen I shall pick pocket them all.
if you say "use AT&T to spite you" you'll just be doing yourself a disservice
Make it happen.
I can't wait to fight unscripted dragons.
Walking along in the forest, suddenly, dragon out of nowhere.
Radimir. Do you agree with me, the first mod for Skyrim, will be a nude mod.
Oh, definitely.
Closely followed by the mod to make everyone look like an anime character.
And then, the pony mod.
Yes.

It looks... Awful.
I'm just saiyan.

Clearly, somebody should have gotten halfway through designing this, thought 'wait, this is not Pinkie Pie. This is a pink horse'
And then stopped.
I want those cupcakes.
Damn it all!

I wonder, if Seth has seen all the Trixie art.
Seen it, saved it, most likely fapped to all the pornographic art and some of the clean art.

blahblahblah sweetie bell
Have some news.
Then, out of nowhere, 'applejack money'.
For some reason, that's under the article, too, in small font.
Seth seems to have a peculiar obsession with Applejack Money.
To add mystery, the file is called, 'applemoneyassbag.png'.
I am confused.
because..
Applejack currency is the best currency.
Next to Pinkie Pie currency, atleast.
Fluttershy currency is worthless, since she just hands it out to whoever needs it.
Dat Applejack money
Damn socialist.
Or, perhaps that's Rarity, since she's the Element of Generosity.
Wat.
Nopenopenope.

You heard me.
I read you. But I didn't hear you.

Happy Women's Equality Day, everypony.
Y'know what would be awesome? If the clock on the logo for Equestria Daily was actually moving.
They can celebrate by making me a sammich with equal amounts of ham and cheese.
Women's Equality Day today?.
Yes.
wait
women havea day?
Yeah
news to me!
Next thing you'll know
They'll want to vote.
they'll have a weekend!
Then.. a week..
then a month!
and then the god damned year!
The OPs are asleep let's be evil.
OPs are asleep
discuss cupcakes.
Radimir: National Dog Day.
wat.
I'm more inclined to muffins.
National Dog Day?
Hahahahahaha!
Muffincupcakes.
Cupfins
Muffincakes.
Fuck I'm now sad, I had a bad thought due to reading that combination of words.
Oh, god, why why why why I'm so damn sad now.
wut?
Let's discuss pretty ponies.
Muffincupcakes.
Like Rarity. :3c
Pinkie Pie is not crazy.
She's just hyper.
I imagined Cupcakes, with Derpy in the place of, uhh... Yeah.
I dislike this very much.
Haven't you seen Muffins?
In place of-
Efreet: And clairvoyant.
/me wonders why he is sad now...
That too.
Yeah, I also hate that Shaico guy, Efreet.
Time for ponies!
I am the happy
Oh, dear.
That Shaico guy is weird.
/me twitches.
<3
Hehehe.
Shaico sounds like a butt.
Sharksky: Because you know that no matter how much progress we make in our lifetimes, our world will never be as perfect as Equestria?
Are you doing this on purpose
;(
Just to tease you. :3
Maybe.
Larscis: NOOOOOOO!
I most certainly not like a butt.
I don't wanna read what you just said

but I already did....
Landsharks.
Ponies worst enemies.
Sharksky: I just had a talk with the ships computer. It hates me.
Grr newfags everywhere.
The anatomy in that picture is... Questionable.
gneifsoeif
I landshark, therefore I am.
How ever shall you go on, Shaico?
Pinkie Pie..
Landsharks worst enemy.
And that landshark is eating Twilight's plot.
Which is somehow extending greatly beyond her rear legs.
Don't worry Twilight. Pinkie Pie'll save you!
idgi
>idgi
? :V
i don't get it?
i think
Makes sense.
What'd I tell ya? Newfags. :(
What are you talking about.
hay. i'm not a newfag.
i'm a lurker.
I'm still not entirely sure how you define somebody as a newfag, Shaico.
Newfags. Y'know.
there's a difference!
Radimir, I am bored.
Watch ponies.
Your face is bored, Shaico.
I want to watch season 2 already.
Or, play with loaded guns.
Either are effective in relieving boredom.
Shaico.
With that comment..
Stop pinging me.
You have just delayed Season 2 by a week.
Play with Loaded guns, start cleaning it. Ignore the chambered round.
No I didn't.
Radimir: I prefer to launch things with my trebuchet.
Last I checked, it's still September 17.
Play with Loaded dice, start playing it. Ignore the gentleman with a gun.
they have yet to announce it.
So far, the record has been set by the engine block of an Oldsmobile Eighty Eight
It's confirmed, Efreet.
It is September 17.
Yeah they did.
ffffffff-
Why ffff?
As the large notice at the top of the site says.
Efreet, read the article for it if you find it.
You should be happy.
you're all party poopers :C
Trying to be a master troll? Nope.
Oh stop being such a saddle sore.
xD
Shaico: OH YOU.
Hehehe.
inb4lonesomeroad'sdelayed.
Yes, stop being such an adjective.
o.O
Hey guys.
The Lonesome Road...
New topic!
Watch. Bethesda shall delay Lonesome Road for the 3rd time. :(
Don't care about Lonesome Road.
Ponies!
Delayed? NO!
I don't play video games anymore.
Sharksky. 20th of September, hopefully.
My sob story of a man who gave up video games.
Go on.
I stopped playing video games.
Tell us, about your story Shaico.
The end. Kinda sucks.
They were too violent for your parents, so they stripped them from you.
Oh.
Nah, my 360 first broke.
And I was like, "Meh, screw it."
Shaico..
You are 15 years old.
You are not a man.
BUT A BOY!
End on the 14th of October.
I enjoyed my NES
Fine, boy works as well.
I played the crap outta Super Mario 2.
I have 2 weeks worth of school to go through.
Wait, Shaico is 15?
I went through hell at school.
Yes, I am Radimir.
Problem?
Yes.
This actually explains quite a bit.
There is a large problem here.
He's 15? Whoa. what..
In particular, your affinity to calling people 'newfags'.
/me is now questioning his morals.
Nah I was literally bored.
Sharksky.
The internet has forsaken us.
Guess what.
CHLOROFORM!
CHLOROFORM!
And Radimir, you only saw me call people newfags once or twice today.
/me shoves a rag in Efreet's throat!
ohgodwha
I've seen you do it before. On multiple days.
I hardly think I have an affinity to call people newfags.
O.O
/me shoves Efreet down his cellar and starts digging a new grave.
What in the name did I walk into?
/me slumps down ontop of Sharksky and crushes him
Oh, hey, it's Lunasta.
I don't recall except that time I called BigMac a newfag.
And hi Lunasta! :o
I'm judging Shaico because he's younger than me.
Meh. I don't care that much, really.
Shaico :D
/me hugs Shaico
/me hugs Lunasta.
You can't leave!
:o
lol hey erryone
Guardians of Equestria
oh hai
Now that I have revealed my age, using my age against me will come soon.
>Sketchy_Sounds is now half-OP
I like it.
/me likes everything.
/me likes everything also.
Oh right yeah I am I guess.
/me hates everything.
Rargh. I'm so edgy.
No, I like everything more than you, Shaico. :V
Funny I was just about to say "Except Sharksky" :P
You ninja.
But... I like you :<
Well that's too bad.
Sorry.
:\
:<
D: WHAT. SKETCHY IS NOW A HALFOP!? FIREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
u mad?
/me gets his shotguns and buys a pitchfork "Revolution!"
/me is now imagining Sketchy putting on a trollface...
Sketchy_Sounds, what did I tell you about ass-kissing?
!muffin
Muffins!! You have any? :3
Yes!
Thank you!!
/me glomps Sharksky
Apparently everything I needed to know, Shaico
:D
Well congrats then.
You have been taught well.
Hurr
Hmmm...
My chat killing abilities.
Dammit, I'm leaking spots
They are legendary.
Gotta write more
We should discuss
Shaico, what's legendary? :3
Something mildly-controversial.
Radimir, get to writing your tropico thing.
omg controversy
>:U
Pokemon that are hard to find.
But I want to wait for Tropico 4, first.
So I can steal stuff from that.
Yes Lunasta ?
When is it released?
You called?
Uhh
2nd, I think.
2nd of Sept?
Yes.
However!
I have conceived of a possible starting point, and something of an ending.
Go on.
So that's a start, at least.
Yay!
/me wants to know more.
/me leers at Fireant while muttering something indistinct under his breath
/me hugs Lunasta.
There there.
I shall Steam you, so these plebians do not steal my ideas.
You can still watch while others gets mod powers!
I'm literally one of the very first ponies on this chat that isn't a mod.
Along with Fiddler and Mongoose.
Come to think of it, where is Mongoose?
!seen Mongoose
Shaico: The last time I saw Mongoose was Fri 26 Aug 2011 02:11:50 AM CEST
That reminds me, i need to ban you for a day so i can be first in the days for the stats :)
Balloons, don't you dare.
xD
lmao
What a cheat.
Dirty fighting. No honor whatsoever. I expected more from an OP. Tsk tsk.
Who needs honor.
Anyone have the links to stats?
/me hugs Shaico "Nein Fireant! Shai, let us be nonmods together :D"
/me kicks his internet
/me squees in glee. "Yes, lets!"
I will mod Shaico.
Done.
/me trollface at Lunasta
:O
Woah
/me grins evilly.
/me kicks his internet even more "Stupid thing is lagging"
The power... IN MY HAND!
/me bursts into a maniacal laugh.
FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
LAGWALL!!!
lolwut
Wait.
Who's HomingoDeFuego?
He's Fireant
The Admin
<3 snips
I know Fireant, silly.
Brb hungry
Massive disconnect and reconnect.
This is massive?
LOL.
Radimir, you should've been here for the netsplits.
I think I was...
Hello johnsey

Had a good night's rest?
eeeeeyup
Good to know, though I don't think you'll be pleased to know that the chat is currently... dead
then we should hide it before somepony gets the wrong ideas and....

my friend's friend (i don't know him very well) is in the army

i think he's in reserve
point is
whenever he does something for his position
he and his friends say stuff like "i have to go to army"
...it's an.. uhh, arrested development joke.
yaknow?
ha ha
ok
no sale.
that's fine.
Stop spamming.
/me is looking at the mad one in the middle of the chat
i don't think i'm spamming
rrrh
I hate it when my dad unplugs me form the router.
though occassionally i tend to type in short lines.
from, even.
but usually that is for effect.
RainbowBrisk: That is spamming.
sounds like writing in short lines to me.
spamming involves repetative posting of things
over and over, in order to bother the channel
Yes. And I see your name.
Over and over again.
i don't believe i'm bothering the channel but if you would like to take it up with a mod or something i would not mind going "on trial" as it were.
Well whatever floats your boat.
it's up to you
i have no problem with my own mannerisms.
/me gets his double barrel and shoots RainbowBrisk "Hold your enter finger"
Hm
!moon RainbowBrisk
Grab my tail, RainbowBrisk!
Hey. Sketchy_Sounds. Guess what!
/me realizes that he accidentally shot buckshot and not the candy cane flechettes
Oops.
:o
so i was spamming, then?
That's what I said, yes.
i didn't think so and i'd like to appeal this claim.
Stop being so goddamn formal.
i'm just being me :|
durnit, Sketchy_Sounds! Guess!
Meh?
Ponies!
poniesponiesponiesponiesponies.
I approve
Heh, my quote.
well i was kicked for what i thought was no reason.
Swag!
which bothers me.
inb4 inb4 inb4ception
RainbowBrisk: Mod's word is law.
Deal with it.
I had to deal with it also.
not if mods can be reasoned with :)
/me is still in disbelief that Sketchy_Sounds is mod.
half mod is still mod.
*half-OP
op
We're unreasonable, illogical, irrational, incompetent Draconians.
ikr Shai.
same thing
xD
well that's kind of annoying, isn't it?
He's only half. His word is only half law.
RainbowBrisk: Suck up your pride would you?
the unreasonable, illogical, irrational, incopetent draconians part.
I decide what half of his word tof ollow!
Shaico: i'm on in that habit.
i'm only following his dumb words.
/me hugs Sketchy_Sounds.
and right now Ron Howard narrates everything in my head which just makes me more headstrong.
i iz loopy :D
/me is hugged
i mean, assuming he's strong. i don't know him
Let us keep things civil and befitting us as Bronies
RainbowBrisk: tbh that was more about testing whether I could do that than anything else, although using the Enter key for a spacebar can be a bother sometimes.
AlphaOmega: We quarrel amongst ourselves for fun at times.
Everypony.
I know how to settle this.

I probably should start my homework, but homework be damned!
In it's natural habitat, the Brony makes extremely random comments.. why this is, is completely unknown.. It is believed to be a ritual.

WHY IS MY MOUTH BURNING OHGOD
Lunastaaaaaaa
Efreet: You ate too much spider venom
Not sure I want to know what that's about
Oh.
That's right.
I fought a few funnelwebs today.
Needed something to wash down their flesh.
Stop testing your invulnerabilities to spider venom :<
My mouth is still burning from it.
no
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50rJNCEL1Z4&feature=related
/me shudders
Haaaaate spiders.
Not in a hide-in-the-corner way, though
Well then Semysane.
More of a smash-it-with-first-available-object way
Don't come to Australia.
More of a kill-it-with-fire way?
HAHAHAHA NO
Our spiders are larger then cars.
our spiders.
at least at least at least
they are larger then cars.
Tiny-ass cars
No
Larger then SUVs
good sir.
lol
do you know nothing about australia?
Our spiders have manabars.
But have you ever seen one of them fight a drop-bear?
no
i haven't.
LAME
haha
by the time i hear a drop bear dropping down, and turn around, the spider's already dead and the dropbear is gone.
All we have is Ogopogo, which is a lake monster, but has the lamest name ever.
you have elk
..
LOL
That name.
Ogopogo
I know, right?
It's too hilarious to be scary.
IIRC, Ogopogo is a protected species though, just in case
76 days.
Hey, what's up.
Until Skyrim.
For me Sonic Generations has priority over Skyrim
he made it on a stamp, though, which is awesome: http://www.pibburns.com/cryptost/can1292z.jpg
I'm taking a "wait and see" approach to Generations
... damn it i lol'd
Logopogo!
Been burned too many times before
lol, the text has to be in English and French on stamps
I preordered it.
Well, good luck then
I just got my preordered Deus Ex the other day, and I am LOVING it
Well in my oppionion none of the games have been that bad exept for 06. Even then I could tolerate that game.
you preordered Deus Ex and JUST got it?
Then there was sonic chronicles, but that was one bioware's hands.
Sonic games? Yeah they used to be good.
Leonon: just got it THE OTHER DAY
Been playing it nearly non-stop since, lol
Wow, did it get lost in the mail?
... It's only been out for a few days
Oh, god, lol
it's been out since like 2001
Deus Ex: HUMAN REVOLUTION
/me never saw what everyone had against most of them. Or more acuratly I saw what people had against it, it was just horribly exagerated.
06 was drek, though. Take two steps forward and another five-minute loading screen boots up.
Speaking of, that's my main gripe with the new Deus Ex, the loading times are atrocious
what are you playing it on?
Yeah 06 was the only one where I agreed with people.
I thought Unleashed was cool. Sure the werehog sections dragged out a bit and it didn't feel like real Sonic but they were still cool. The day stages were all epic.
I listened to people complain about shadow the hedgehog for three years before getting it. Then I was like "And the big problem is?". Honestly the game played fine. Sure the vehicles were broken but there was never any part that actually made you use them.
Exept that one mission that's really hard withought using the moter cycle
And that Cool Edge day music - sheer awesome.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa11tMeCqNE
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Sonic Unleashed &quot;Holoska - Cool Edge Day&quot; Music
Leonon: playing it on the 360
Sorry, bud, but Shadow was a turd.
/me shrugs
have you put it on the harddrive?
Shadow moved funny. Kept sliding around. That was my major grief.
It was the first of many.
FIND THE KOMPYUTA ROOM!
Find the chaos emerald!
Find Froggy!
Which is right in front of the computer room so I don't see why you can't just snatch the emerald then head for the room.
Leonon: not nearly enough space to try that

What happened to my hand?!
Hey. That owl belong to anyone?
Skate three is lulz in its highest magnitude
I think it belongs to Twilight
Damn, Efreet.
You broke your fingers
You punched so hard.
Oh god, your hand!
That's too bad. Well, I ain't hungry anyhow.
For a second there, I thought there was another nightly roundup...
"Because airships are cool"
Radimir.
Airships ARE cool just ask final fantasy or Sky's of Arcadia
You did the exact same response as someone else who I showed it to.
I am that person.
oh my god

my mind is full of buck.

If your mind is full of buck, you need to take cover from the guy with the shotgun
But I am the guy with the shotgun..

lol
You mean Skies of Arcadia
/me reads the detailed stats page
Haaww yeah. ALL AWESOME:
Locke is back
Sounds like me in Deus Ex. I never realized how FUN going stealthy could be. I always found it irritating in games like Metal Gear Solid
Playing as a stealth character in new vegas isn't fun to me.. :C
I played Splinter Cell and Hitman. I love going stealthy
I like how there is a grenade minigun.
Ooh
Simply because the AI is like "Wut.. someone got shot? Oh well."
I need to finish Blood Money
/me also played stealth in Oblivion
The Mardi Gras mission is so frustrating.
The whole game is fustrating, but that's why I love it.
I just hate having the follow the first bird guy for ages
Through the crowds
Try to sedate
WTF ARE YOU DOING
Everypony.
I would like to make it known.
I hate birds.
I have a friend who loves birds.

Gilda's a griffon, there's a difference.

What! Why?
Old internet meme reference
The attack is absorbed by the darkness!
Hi
GET OUT.
Hi.
Radimir.
Have you seen Gintama before?
I have never heard of that.
If you have. Why do all the videos make me question my sanity?
It appears to be anime.
I would imagine that is the reason.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yi85ov08Kg&feature=related
In addition, it also means that I will never watch it.
just try looking at that scene.
So what do you guys call it when some one is RPing an unbeatable character?
godmod
So, like
Could somebody please explain why weeaboos like the Japanese language so much?
waaaat
Thats what we called it too.
It sounds like continuous whining.
It's hilarious.
:(
To you I guess.
Most of the song sin my computer are Japanese.
That or they come from video games.
Maybe I'm just thinking of anime voice acting, but wow.
Herpes! Herpes meee!
Shrill, high-pitched harpies.
I once heard a Francophone describe English as sounding like the speaker is constantly choking
I often wonder what English sounds like to somebody who doesn't understand it.
Most people I know describe German as sounding perpetually pissed off.
or was that russian?
Probably like odd gibberish with the occasional word stolen from the speaker's language
I would imagine Russian.
That said, I would LOVE to be able to speak Russian, along with Arabic.
Both sound badass.

As I mentioned on the post.
ah someone already made the point in comments
i would cast magic missile
I would cast Agidyne.
I would go read a book.
I am not very interesting
Wait, Agidyne?
I would probably be adorkable
Isn't that a powerful fire spell from Shin Megami Tensei?

DST is a waste of time.
we recently changed our DST dates, now its 6 months on and off
WA doesn't have DST
yay
nor does QLD
The only people who would need the time change would be farmers, and even then there are atomic clocks and lights to keep the dark away.
its funny SA ends up 30mins ahead of QLD
Even farmers could just do a special trick called "getting up earlier"
wait..
..
SA ends up AHEAD of QLD?
LOL
I thought that WA did have DST?
We don't.
I think QLD is the only state without it.
Are you all in Australia?
/me yawns.
Radimir: Neither AZ nor HI have DST
I meant Australian states.
http://wa.gov.au/daylightsaving/
Queensland
Okay, off to go do a ropes course that's a mandatory part of orientation.
The worst and best state.
Though seeing as how the VP is such a VIP, shoudn't we keep the PC on the QT? 'Cause if it leaks to the VC he could end up MIA and then we'd all be put on KP.

My favriot Dream Cast game was Sonic Shuffle
I thought Dreamcast only had pirated games?
Well It is really easy to pirate games on the dream cast
But then you don't get the sense of ownership
I burn games for my PS2 only to use 'em as backups to preserve the original discs
Sonic Shuffle was basicly the Hard Strategy version of Mario Party
And if you sak me it was better than mario party
Or like Tales of the Abyss or Policenauts: buy the game, burn a patched version on a disc and play that

what*s with the spike at december 2010?
that is a very good question
i think it has something to do with 4chan
but i'm not sure, maybe anyone of you knows better
hmm....
I have a theory.
Ponies.
my Filly self isn't old enough to know this
Poniesponiesponiesponiesponies.
/me is brushie-ing Fluttershy while watching a Jackie Chan movie. feelsgoodbrony
Here's why there's a spike on december..
oooh, which Jackie Chan movie?
it's when everyone has their Xmas break
and are free to do what they want
obviously that being ponies
Shanghai Noon? Twin Dragons? One of the Rush Hours?
The Medallion. pretty old, and not one of his best, but i still watned to see it :P

..if I don't come back, it's because my internet's an ass :C
hmm, not sure if I trust this infogram
according to it, 73% of all web traffic is social media
/me 10is jelly of you peoples with the good internets
that seems wrong
Good internets?
Sharing a 7.5 meg circuit with 100 people doesn't work too well man
10I'm sharing this across two of us, and the other one is making a conference call, so I've taken the backseat :P http://www.speedtest.net/result/1450460274.png
what the-
10^^
are you guys sharing a tethered 3G connection or something
unless they catergories 'porn' as 'social media'
10XD no, home broadband
10like, cables and stuff
wow
10just the cables are bad, and we're in the middle of nowhere so they have no motivation to work on it, or lay fiber-optic cables and junk
10so I'm stuck on that for now :D
it's fine :D
Gotcha
Well hey
It gets you to ponies
10ikr :p
10it gets me to youtube if I leave the video to buffer for a while, so hey no worries
that's good then
hmm
doubt i'm gonna make it long enough to watch anything but dat LOTR lineup B:
Nasa: We saw a black hole eat a star millions of light years away.
me: And this effects me how?
there's 2 FiM afterwards. is that what you mean?
10Well to be honest, I doubt I'll see much of the LotR films as they are MeteorVenture
10Gonna get very late very fast :p
ikr, and i too am with my dad only time of year. so i may also not watch them : /
NASA: Well, we thought you'd like an update on how your mother's doing
nah i mean i've been up for a while already so i'm probably gonna sleep through it
10Fair hehe, what timezone you in?
Daayuummm
CST
/me 10*googles*
so it's 9:00AM right now]
10Oh i see :p
i've been up since about 2 something
10oh lawdy
!link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21033
10why's that? O.o
Twilight told me this picture is about artist:madmax mma rainbow_dash madmax pinkie_pie
btw, don't forget those are the extended editions of the trilogy
worst description ever
i like that not many people are running through the house at night and also my brother has some computer time during the day so i would have to wait through it if i was awake during that half of the day
aww, no makes
and i like the nighttime lol
10That makes sense. I have the same reasoning, but for staying up atrociously late most nights :p
10I like the night. It's peaceful, tranquil. Plus there's nobody around to get in the way ;)
ya i don't have a job yet and nowhere to really be so i can sleep whenever (inb4 b& for bragging)
10xD
/me 10is in the same position until he starts uni on 24th semptember
10also, I can't spell
uni..corn
you become a unicorn on the 24th of september
10oh god
Cakes.
10I'm going to be a unicorn
10I wanted to be a pegasus pony
10God, y u do dis
why else do you think it costs so much?
10damn straight
RainBroDash is a pegasus already
10aww yeaah
http://i.imgur.com/kOzrL.png
oui?
10for now :3
for now?
i got an idea.. maybe if you pay for unicorn and pegasus you can be an alicorn.. it's debateable whether you need to play for earth pony as well
lawl
10fund it :P
if i was that rich i would have a more magical computer
hey what about being a unicorn but having a really really good ability for the wings spell? win, amirite?
10meh, would still rather be a pegasus :p
pies?
I'm pretty sure the size of an alicorn is supposed to represent an earth pony's strength. Otherwise it would only serve to represent earth ponies as inferior to the other races
hmm...well i think i'll be a unicorn when i make mine
muffins!
i was happy and slightly surprised when lauren explained earth ponies in the same way that i was already thinking they were
what was her explanation?
i'm not sure whether she said any of this as a sure thing or as "i like to think of it like this" sort of thing.. but i'm pretty sure she basically said that they have a special connection with the earth
yeah, they are much more physically stong than Unicorns and Pegasi
ah i remember that now! yea i loved that explanation
really makes RD look even more of an athlete, if she keeps up with AJ, like, one of the strongest earth ponies :3
/me 10isn't too fussed for explanations, just likes the ponies :3
well AJ probably doesn't do that sort of training
!link
she is strong but maybe not as swift
Wonderful.
Y'know what I need?
Well.
What I want?
an awesome mod compilation for oblivion.

wat?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z0nQcC9cPI - Twilight Uncensored [FIXED]
but that makes sense cause she was going to be an earth pony and pinkie pie be a pegasus so themoreyouknow.jpg
so i guess they might have had these ideas from the beginning
i knew that, but i still cna't imagine pinkie as a pegasus i mean:
I do imagine her as a pegasus actually.
I MEAN DUDE WTF SHE'S EASILY THE FASTEST PONY WITH THE MOST ENDURANCE, but doesn't brag about it, AND DUDE YOU WANNA GIVE HER WINGS TOOOOOO??????
Dermathil wat. her as a pegasus would make the universe implode
EEEEEYUP
exactly
lol that's my thoughts exactly.. well pretty much anyway
:P
even RD couldn't run from her
effectively anyway
ikr, now give her wings? D:
that is beautiful
there's a comic where she goes supersaiyan to gain wings some where lol
Yeah, Pinkie can teleport better than Twilight
Twilight cursing is the best cursing
she would do a rainboom (or whatever her version of it is) every other flight session
^ this this so much this!
and that too MeteorVenture
Who's talking about Impulse Tracker?
:3
Oh I saw that one
I did a random link
But we already know Pinkie's other side, so I don't think she can go super saiyan
Oh.
lol i didn't think that was a reply to me cause of how fast you said it:P
you're also 100% right though haha
Alright, leaving.
lol well you saw the comic with the mythbusters.. she drank the coffee
didn't even need wings to make a huge explosion
take care dermathil:D
bai Dermathil
SO!
haha loved taht comic too
so?
Among my friends, its sort of a running joke that we change Tony's netbook's desktop wallpaper to something pony related every time he leaves it unattended
right.
(even if he locks it, I know his password, he's too lazy to change it)
we know who tony is.
wtf how is a 720p movie of 2 hours only 500MB? myheadisfullofapples
he's the guy you know.
yes, he's a friend, thats all thats important
this time, I decided to be somewhat cruel
Bad encode probably
can't leave out important details.
i think so
gonna test it out ... now :P
ya.. they eventually noticed the talking ponies.. and at the beginning i was surprised rarity was smiling with whatever that thing is called that was on her head.. a muzzle?
since his netbook runs linux, I edited his bashrc file so that it resets his desktop wallpaper to rarity every time he opens a terminal
yea it ain't great...still, it's very watchable for 500 mb :3
will view later
Every. Single. Time.
what movie is it?
Pitch Black. haven't seen it.
(Vin Diesel as 'Riddick')
prequel to the better known Chronicles of Riddick, which I love
he was paranoid about me having altered anything else for the rest of the day
...woah
DASHIE
Ah screw it.
You aren't gonna answer meh.
I AM
O HAI
Ah, gotcha
never saw that myself
i mean any of it
somebody type !moon
!moon Mehal
Grab my tail, SouthernCross!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkN4EbJM7LM&NR=1
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
Twilight told me this video is about Applejack&#39;s Bad Day.
owned
i'm scared of that video.
/me returns with an assload of moon rocks
Moonrocks?
Hi, Daz
I'll buy some moonrocks. I need them to make some combustible lemons.
Hi MeteorVenture, hi AllisZero
no, they are mine! For SCIENCE!!
Screw you man.
I'm typing like a BR at times because I'm so tired.
:C
I asked someone
Why Rarity is always spy?
Hey Barry !
I never really was on your side.
Rarity would be awesome as a Spy
yo barry
cmon....Rarity as James Bond ;D
..
ooh yeah...''smells the epicness''
...
;P just sayian
......
NOPE.
Nope.Avi or just nope?
:P
just nope.
you don't deserve nope.avi.
hahahaha(wait what?)
now I want to watch Drawn Together and replace MLP's audio with it
So let's see...AJ is on top 6 while Rarity is on top 5....
Hahahaha.. Yeah.. Yeah.. Wait.. what?
Who's the most favorite pony atm?
"I mean, who wants to be known as the girl who's had 7 abortions?"
"Yeah.. wait.. what?"
Pinkie Pie is <3
Heh...really...thought it was Fluttershy ;)
Pinkie Pie is awesome
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sV5eNEK1mME/TldWS9P9M2I/AAAAAAAALBk/2YnqlvQmY48/s1600/081411____mlp_fim_cupcakes_by_dahli_lama-d46l0va.jpg
Suddenly, cupcakes.
I want those cupcakes.
Rainbow Dash's looks awesome. But I'd love to eat Pinkie Pie's.
..
you know.. when season 1 ended i planned on taking a decent break or at least a big step back to do some other things so it's all fresh again when season 2 arrived.. but i got very little done.. still some though
what? no Luna cupcake....
She escap- I should stop myself there.
/me graps his Luna Republic flag and pitchfork... it's time for someone to feel the wrath of the Republic...
also i planned on getting a job so i could watch ponies in high quality on a really nice monitor with no lag whatsoever.. eh still working on it though
Although I'll admint my life is pretty pony right now, i'll still say this: There's a lot more to life than Ponies
ya i know lol.. i was gonna use that computer for quite alot of other things as well
:3
Well, I'm off to bed
night everypony
!lullaby
/me carries Untamed off to bed
/me tucks Untamed in and hums a lullaby
like recording and playing video games in super awesome quality with more importantly.. no lag whatsoever
<3
Hey Barry
Sorry, had a guy from our fiber company
/me sleeps easily with Derpy's lullaby
but other than the computer it's nice to have some income for anything else as well
sure is
i plan on making video games and i'm sure that's pretty expensive
not that i can code for anything right now.. i'm still working on step 1
Passion is the first step!
sure is!
in everything you ever do!
haha ok then i'm still working on step 2:P and still partly step 1
Yaaay~
?
its quiet here...
o.o
yes
yes it is
No, not really.
I r back
/me 10can't do anything yet
which brings me to wonder.. if you don't have passion how do you go about getting it? or if you do then how do you increase it?
you might hear someone say you don't, you find it. I'm here to tell you that you do bot.
Thats right, you find it AND you make it yourself. Just like the CMC's, try loads of stuff till you like one of them, then keep doing that one thing
10All I've found so far is that the only time I get inspired to do anything long-term, it's by pure random chance
*crickets*
i think most things are things you can work on in one way or another.. things aren't nearly as set in stone as people say they are
So who wants some delicious cupcakes?
but i still think there are things set in stone
me!
10meh
oh god,only idiots think anyones life is ever 'set in stone'
I would like some pie.
sure some things
but 'your hwole life' ? No, mate, it's really not
!lullaby
/me carries Mehal0 off to bed
/me tucks Mehal0 in and hums a lullaby
o.0
I, PhotoFinish,
have arrived.
Um
so?
Awwwyeah, PhotoFinish.
!sun
Yay?
/me takes pictures
ya definitely not.. those are excuses
Celebraties!
wait... what would be set in stone even?
for those who didn't do anything or get anywhere
Danke, danke schon, ENOUGH.
GGgala: 'your exam results decide your LIFE' 'now ure at uni your LIFE is set in stone' 'now u got the job your LIFe is set in stnoe'
10GGgala, things like impotency
RainBroDash: lawl
lol
10well it's true :P
maybe
10or fine, maybe sterility
not with HORNZYTE, the natural unicorn enhancement
10better example
10and lol
From experience I can tell you that if you don't have passion, you have to make up for it with determination
10that's a super lot of effort, determination without passion
10I'll just turn over and go back to sleep kthx :3
You can't do anything of your life without one or the other, but having both passion and determination will get you far.
i think sometimes if you just do it then it can turn into a passion
Yep, but there are people like that you know, and it's commendable in my opinion
also Daz: ahhh i see what you mean thar
!lullaby
/me carries asexylady off to bed
/me tucks asexylady in and hums a lullaby
I haf killed this chat.
lol @ durpybot
/me floats like a butterfly
really depends on if you believe in what you're doing though
"The dead aliens are still dead. And still aliens, but that-.. god damn it I'm too tired to quote RvB properly.
/me is level one. Needs level ups
To me passion has more to do with the emotional kick of accomplishing something, of loving something for what it's worth. Determination is, on the other hand, the logical knowledge of what you do and the goal you want to achieve
"Washington used to wet the bed! *laugh* I'm going to go tell the guys"
10I'm very passionate about my naptimes
HOHOHO
rest is important
people should do it more
*looks at half of the chat*
10xD
i'm pretty sure that when i'm really tired i'm getting almost nothing good done and it would be so much more beneficial to go to sleep and use the extra time to do something when i'm awake
and if you have work to do that applies even more
!link drunk
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/36967
now let's all take a huge nap before the stream
^How I feel right now
Sometimes you need to choose between getting rest and doing what you love
that way our jokes are funny to people other than us during the stream
well sometimes perhaps but it's probably usually not that way
RainBroDaaaassssshhhh~~~~ :3

and thus the rapeseed has been planted
10LolXD
yes, the rapeseed was seeded through rape, ha ha ha
nobody can ever grow rapeseed innocently again can they ;_;
could they ever? even as a kid i realized the potential pun D:
RainBro, make sure the other new mods that I haven't gotten it from yet (Cross and Denied) give somepony their stuff for the About Us page, or, preferably, PM it to me on the forums.
canola oil is RAPE...seed

so you have heard this song then?
err.. daz rather i guess lol.. i don't understand IRC sometimes
ya i have:D i asked for the weirdest music someone could find
oh you wanted weirdest msuci?
well, again, i have about 100 odd songs that are very 'weird' but i could link one :P
i urge you to ask others though aswell
anyway the reason i was asking is cause of what you were saying earlier about passion and stuff (saying this doesn't help the fanfic idea) so anyway i just took you for the type to like lots of music
or at least good music of a variety of sorts
anyway no i wasn't asking for weird music lol.. just music you personally liked alot
i sure do, but I don't see how that implied I liked music lol
songs I like a lot?
well here's one I love to bits
i don't expect you to give me music based on what i like cause you don't know what i like lol.. but i like alot of different types of music
it didn't imply you like music but i was guessing based on your character

Err...
Omae no XXX de Ten wo Tsuke actually
How did I fuck up the song name that much
there's english version, but i prefer spanish. besides, it's awesomely dubbed by a Spanish singer, so it's alos it's own song :3
i don't understand spanish but hey if it flows well it's all good:D
i actually watched treasure planet a while ago on a synchtube
nice
quality of vid is awful, but eh
i got another song lined up for when this is over
and i'm trying to post as many genres Ican .

lyrics in description
"I remember when this was a game. Where did I loose it. I'm so ashamed. We lost the touch somewhere on this ride. You're better than us. You're the old school pride. Always competing you never relax. If we make ten then you make eleven tracks. I'm wondering can't you have some fun. If I'm just walking why do you have to run."
"When we started it was supposed to be fun. It lasted for three good years in the sun. Business came in and took over the lead. That is where you came together with greed. We don't really care about what you do. If you make a record real good. Then lucky you. But now I see panic in your eyes. You better slow down my friend. OK let me help you take my hand."
"You spit in my hand. You spit on me. So sad to see this makes me sick."

almost done with Pinkie... some stray hairs, but eh, it's my first "proper" try.
^wat
hair pins seem pretty much mandatory, Daz, btw, when you do curls
when i see the name sirsprinkles.. i keep thinking in the back of my mind "sergeant sprinkles"
RobotPinkie: needed for fluttershy?
lol, refresh the page to see the banner, take like 5 minutes to finish >.<
yet, totally worth it :P
RobotPinkie: can you tell he how you do them then? the curls? i just see pics but don't get it
I don't think so, Daz, haven't looked up yet how to do her hair :P
well she and Daisy onlyo nes I got so ones i'm looking at rite now : P
Oh! Sath-...er...Galadriel, do you know if there will be a LQ stream as well?
for tonight that is
11I can't promise that
fair enough
we don't always talk about porn in there ;)
Sure, Daz. Might post a video tutorial if I redo it to avoid stray hairs.
RobotPinkie: i have found 2 goodish ways of doing FS so far
text tutorials are kinda hard to follow...

what wasn't?
that's why I hate cats
the love interest
I keep timing out

That, or shes really a pushover
I usually don't prefer female cats
But, but :'(
most of them are bi*ches...
male cats are more awesome
Not if you have my cats
(and the last link is not valid)
4Oh, he sounds like the kid from Up!
I have a he and a she though
how many cats you got?
he might just be the same VA
i jus got one :c
i got a few theories about music and stuff
crazy cat people
doubt it since they're both voiced by boys
Cats are cuuute
real mean love cats
are they?
and ponies!
birds are better
But, I love any animal really
sometimes boy parts are just ladies who are very talented
Uh
Dogs are boring when they are old
guise can anyone lend me a ha-a hoof with this? I'm trying to be completely uptodate with 'pony music archive 1.5' but don't get what I'm supposed to d/l
I use to raise dogs ;]
but where I'm currently living, I can't own a dog
Howdy-doo.
apartment rules :c
heya Junkie
you want who to put a thing in the what now?
especially Budgerigars
G'day
Most women voicing boys sound weird like Bart Simpson. or Phil from Rugrats
they can be old as dirt and still be energetic as a small child
PHEW, Pinkie finally done
this is amazing though o.o
just need to dry now

oh it's dryig :3

I'll take pics when it's dry, I don't have hairdryer though =C

Forever alone
ah well...

No wait, that's me
when we had 40 we desided maybe breeding them wasn't the best idea

amen
Things I learned this summer: I love Bethesda RPGs but suck at them
4Why do you suck at them/
4*?
NOSWAITH DDA, VAL
you can set the difficulty lower Riders
was i the only one pretty disappointed with oblivion?
oh wait...
mew
MeteroVenture: Eeenope
meteor* even
5Im sorry, but this is insulting
4Yeah, if it's difficulty, then you can just turn it down
5*pauses stream*
I freely admit that they're way over my head. Too much micro-managing to keep track of if you want to get really good.
all in favor of Shivering Isles being the greatest expansion ever?
lol "even".. is that a reference to snagglepuss?
>implying the previous episode wasn't :P
well the nice thing about it Riders is that if you don't want to worry about it you don't have to. You can set the difficulty lower and just do whatever you feel like
At least you get an episode. Where's Africa?
I'm not bagging on it. I'm glad someone is willing to make RPGs that hardcore. But I've been playing their games since Morrowind and it can take me years just to be able to survive
4Ahhh, Morrowind
but the thing is the difficulty is REALLY annoying at the same time.. there's no strong monsters.. as you get better so do the enemies and if you have it on a high difficulty they get better faster than you do so you have a better chance at level 1
and when i say no strong monsters i mean not that i have seen.. i kinda quit mid-game for a while
4BINGO
all the difficulty changes is the health and damage they do
4HAHA
11SUPRISE!
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=ZAqGs441qzU This game can't come any sooner, can it? ;-;
not the actual items or anything
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
4"Surprise! : D"
4"Take his stuff!!!"
5*dang*
Galadriel: you having blue text for LOTR as well?
I've never been handed my ass so many times as a level 1 character before I played Fallout 3
4What a bunch of dicks XD
lol
11I might do, not sure yet
Oh wow, Fallout 3, yeah
http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/50009 ... i'm tired too to see so much images of Rarity being pull by her horn
5fallout:NV ruined F:3 for me
5i,e hardcore mode
i had the game on max difficulty from the beginning and my and my brothers had little problem progressing through half the game.. i even beat what was probably one of the hardest challenges in the game on that difficulty
5<3
I'm so glad they returned to slightly more hardcore difficulty
Obsidian ruined an RPG. What else is new?
4Fallout 3 isn't bad at all
i mean on oblivion
lol I'm looking forward to playing New Vegas
4It's New Vegas that you gotta worry about
I'm waiting for the GotY edition :P
bah...I give up! I can't watch the streams with this connection! *rageface*
4Since the original team took back NV, they *really* buffed Deathclaws
But New Vegas was Obsidian, not Bethesda.
Nice
Obsidian....grrrrr.
4But it was the same team
They were a bit too easy in Fallout 3, though... you could meet them very early on
Obsidian ruined potentially the greatest series ever
Bethesda is infamous for being the kiss of death for franchises
4All of the original team members (as far as I can recall) made NV
Obsidian, my bad
Yeah Obsidian is made up from a lot of old Falloiut people
Ghosties, nope.
from Fallout 1 and 2
4Yes, Dashite
4Right, from Fallout 1 and 2
4Those guys made NV
Obsidian has a lot of people from Black Isle, but there are a lot of people that aren't there.
Obsidian was created by Black Isle members after they got fired by Interplay
I can see why they were fired
lol
oblivion would have been so much better imo if it didn't have a set difficulty
god damn Obsidian....ruining KotOR
4All I know is, if you're a low level character and you come across a Deathclaw, you are fucked
MeteorVenture: you mean an adjustable difficulty?>
Only thing bad about KotOR 2 was that the publisher forced them to rush it out...
KotOR 2 > KotOR 1 (minus the ending, that was pretty shitty)
So many bugs
4And if you're high level and have excellent equipment, you're still fucked if there's more than one Deathclaw
KotOR 2 was so terrible Dashite!
Nope
no i mean a set difficulty.. as you get better so do the enemies so it's pretty set
All I'm saying, KotOR 2, NWN 2, Dungeon Siege 3; I see a pattern
It wasn't until fanmade mods/patches that it was actually PLAYABLE
4I prefer KOTOR 2 over the first one
>8,610 RD chrome theme useres. >495 Twilight Chrome theme users.
I liked KotOR 2, but it needed about 6 more months in development
It was playable on release, it just had a shitty ending cause half of it was missing.
And stop trollin Dashite, KotOR 2 was terrible
KotOR 2 had the POTENTIAL to be amazing
which is why I'm glad Team Gizka finally finished the TRP
Not trolling at all. KotOR 2 story beat the shit out of KotOR 1.
4Yeah, yeah, "KOTOR1 was amazing and wonderful and great" blah blah blah
4I get it
4I enjoyed the game too
....
4But I'm just saying that I prefer KOTOR2
maybe that's cause all the RD fans use chrome and all the twilight fans use firefox
so... anypony want to see a video ? :3
Did Team Gizka ever actually release their version? Last I heard someone else released a competing mod.
yeah, they released it
I haven't played it yet, as it's on my desktop at home
but I'm very eager
not Obsidian's fault, though... They were under contract and had to push it out
Glitchy to the max, Boring intro, non-existent ending, boring characters, weak enemies
They had to cut over a whole fucking planet from the game...
Makes me so pissed off, if only they'd gotten more time to finish.
and yeah, sorry Dashite but the story was just fail. If they had actually FINISHED it, then yes I can see it being better because it had so much potential
5this is the chain of events with many potentially great games
5i blame publishers
5i.e go steam go!
/me 4wishes KOTOR2 would finally release on Steam
RobotPinkie = I would believe that if it weren't for the fact that every game they've released since has had the exact same flaws
Dungeon Siege 3.
well no, there was publisher problems with KotOR II
really.. what is this cartoon about anyway?
6This chat is now about trains.
6Discuss.
5Il ike trains
4Fuck trains
5...
choo choo!
4Trains suck
what kind of video?

5trains ae 20% cooler than cars
howdy Synros
6Derailing with trains ftw.

Well, you can believe what you like, Riders. The big problem is that they don't have enough clout to pull a Blizzard or Valve thing with development times
Alpha Protocol, a game that was delayed for polish and still had all of those issues.
4I liked Alpha Protocol
I loved the story, but it had some issues.
I liked it when it was playable
5mfw i havent played any of the games you keep mentioning
Wrek, you are a horrible human being and you should feel bad.
lolol I like it too. It has some flaws, but it's one of the most elaborate RPGs of recent years
lol Oh hey Wrek.
so long as you've played Deus Ex Wrek, you're fine by me :P
Never played it.
lol
:p
Has anypony picked up Human Revolution yet
Oh, hey Riders
5I have
not yet no
My copy arrived yesterday.
¬_¬
Nope
I don't have a pc that can run it
Naw, I hear it's great though
well...my desktop prolly can
5my conclusion so far is GOTY
but that's at home
I'm considering renting it tonight.
5but that will probably change with skyrim
I'm really glad to hear that Wrek
5thoguh still a great game
Man, I'm really looking forward to Skyrim...
because I was worried the moment I heard SquareEnix was getting a hand on it
a pony video ^^.... anyway here it is
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7k3pubdumw
Can't wait until I get to play it in 2013 when the GotY edition is out!
after ruining Supreme Commander...I will never forgive them
lololol
5also im never touching another gearbox game
I just hope they don't screw over Hitman and Tomb Raider
SupCom2 was... eh...
dat background music
Why, Wrek? Borderlands was pretty good...
Hi Purple`Prose
Screw Hitman and Tomb Raider. They have Thief now.
5boarderlands is the exeption
or are you blaming them from the flaming paper bag of poop on your doorstep what is Duke Nukem Forever?
AHHHHH

Nice. A bit heavy on the bloom effects, but nice.
5or whatever it was named
Never played a Tomb Raider.

Ah
5and i never forgave them
the good old days of Labrynth
or was it Maze?
I can't remember
5i still play marathon
I'm... I dunno... luke warm on Bungie
5ValtheWizard: Pathways into darkness?
I thought Halo 1 & 2 were great, but the 3rd one was way too buggy in single player
Hi guys
Hey Rodman.
My rage when I got a checkpoint three times during the game when the AI drove me off a cliff...
Maybe....it was that really old shooter for the Mac where you were in a maz killing...zombie...cyclops...things
howdy rodman
lol! Nice checkpoint. :D
ohai Rodman!
Marathon.
5(nostalgia rant) i never enjoyed a game so much as when i first played marathon 2. it was my life for half a year
and yeah Marathon series is great, and free now :D
Hi Dashite, hi ValtheJean, hi RandomExtra
5u jsut hooked Daz up with them
was it marathon? >mfw I can't even remember the games I used to play
u?
http://www.amazon.com/Sharkman-~-Super-Swim-Set/dp/B003GOBESY I need to get one of these, because every girl's crazy about a shark dressed man
We stating how much we love MArathon now? COUNT ME IN!
I love the first 3 Halos and Reach. I just hope they don't make a habit of anually releasing. I'm looking at you COD
5ValtheWizard: http://cdn3.spong.com/screen-shot/p/a/pathwaysin61233/_-Pathways-Into-Darkness-Power-Mac-_.jpg
http://trilogyrelease.bungie.org/
YES
THAT'S IT!
5ey RobotPinkie
And that is seriously badass of Bungie to release them like that
<3's Wrek
5source.bugnie.org is the way to go
5bungie*
I... have never played a Halo single player game.
lol oh okay, Wrek
On my part, I hope Gearbox does something to revive the Duke Nukem series and avoid another DNF
the first one was okay, and I can tolerate it as the first modern shooter
I just use custom repositories, never had to download from Bungie :P
but the other games have nothing to which I can respect
5RobotPinkie: im not counting on it
Why's that Valthe?
Rodman, I wouldn't be too worried about that.
not counting on what, Wrek?
Oh?
meh, Duke is dead. I say let him rest with his history of amazing games (not acknowledging DNF)
oh cool
5though i would like to see a modern version of shadow warriro
theres an expand feature on youtube now....
DNF made money for Gearbox. He will be back with something designed from the ground up by Gearbox.
Leonon: hell yeah
Duke was dead a long time ago. Gearbox is just trying to reinvent him
AND GHOSTIES!
Is gone.
Damn,.
(DNF didn't happen.), LONG LIVE DN3D!
5am i the only one that played shadow warrior?
and I think it's best to let him lie, don't rustle up the dead
5:C
he had a good run
Nope Wrek
hell, he had an amazing run
5:D
it's best to just leave him as a legend
alright you guys
what do you want to see?
5how long untill stream starts?
5LOTR that is
11many hours :)
I don't blame Gearbox for DNF. Nothing could be done to salvage that train wreck
Shadow Warrior is open source now, also, which is nice :)
5 hous I think wrek
ValtheWizard: We all know how well that went for poor Ashley Williams
hours* even
5okiedokie
still have to buy it for the data files, but eh...

Bm isn't that hard
ok, dont want to miss anyhting but i guess i can log off and do work for a few ore hrs
Just bar an Am on fret 2.
bye all
Octavia.
right now our Lady Galadriel is presenting us favorable tv show streams :P
later chaenee
It's how I play 'em
chaenne* even
14Dats me
later CHAENNE
Dat Grass <3
ohai octavia
7See you in a bit CHAENNE
I didn't see you log in :P
Sadly I think I may only be able to stay for the Fellowship lest my bandwidth be destroyed
what does Bar mean?
Sorry I'm very inexperienced and compeltely self-taught.
You've not been playing guitar long, then
sorry to hear that tictac
/me nods
OK
What it means is this
14ai thar Val
14*hai
if it makes you feel better, I'm in a library with such little bandwidth I have to refresh every minute or so :P
Make a regular Am shape, using only your 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers
I'd set the stream to low but then I'm just watching some angry pixels
5its brittish alright
and how are you this fine Friday Octavia?
14Tired. Just got up a few ago. :P
Now, slide that up so your fingers are occupying the 3rd and 4th frets.
ah
7angry pixels? :o
>mfw this is wow...
they're very angry :P
I'll be back in 3 HOurs 51 Mins and 20 Seconds
Angry pixels are angry!
lol, see you later tictac
Then put your first finger over all the strings on the second fret, essentially as though you were using your finger as a capo.
byebye Tictac!
XD
later Tictac
I'll be back in three hours as well
see you then rodman
cya Rodman
Stream will start in about 4 hours right?
later Rodman
wow that works! but its pretty hard to hold those notes. My pinkie is my worst finger currently.
Or alternatively, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBnS4uhaXAI Watch this video to learn how
7NEXT UP: Darkwing duck
eeyup rodman
:D
OK sounds like you managed fine ;p
And yeah
Alright, see you then
It takes some getting used to using your pinkie
I type and a draw too. My hands are the only part of me thats impresive. hahah.
7suddenly advertisements
YESSS
I should buy tiny weights and give my pinkie a montage.
But yeah, barring an Am on fret 2 is the easiest way to play a Bm IMO
aw you're not playing the whole ep?
Thank you my lady <3
7I will
<3
Plus also once you get the hang of that it makes playing a lot of other songs easier.
FOOTBALL
How so?
For example if you wanted to play Wild Thing, it's an E, then an E barred on the fifth, then on the 7th, then back to the 5th and back down to an E.
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TRACK OF FOOTBALL
JOHN MADDEN. owait, wrong football...
7lol
Oh and to use an MLP example: At The Gala is nothing more than sliding A and E varinats around the frets.
haha
wow
**variants
7Dry :D
7Sometimes fires go out
Whoops~
DULL DULL
UNBEARABLY DULL
<3
But yeah. It'll become very useful once you start to realise what bar chords map to where.
For example: barre an E on the first fret and you have an F, barre it on the third and you're playing a G.
hey Wrek
>>;; I guess I need to go to a real music class then..
14Hai thar Wrek
ohai wrek
just relogged
this sounds awful complex.
It's honestly not
you still get an ohai anyway :P
I learned that without music classes.
LOL TB
TB or not TB...
Let's just use an easy example so you get what I'm on about.
You know how to play a G, right?
bit weird isn't it....
looool
XD
yeah
14I really like the banners too Wrek, awesome. :D
I can play winter wrap-up with the thing in front of me
Play yourself a G. Then, take your E chord and slide it on up so your fingers are in the fourth and fifth frets, and barre the third fret.
It just doesnt sound perfect (because I dont always hit chrods properly when switching)
>mfw I just noticed the extremely awesome banner
:P
Hi, all

7Did you try IE?
yeah, did my PM not go through?
Naa, they're simple.
LOL
7nope
You just gotta pace yourself with what you learn and when
7working fine here with cell phone connection
oh...well that's frustrating
I'll send it again
did that one work?
hello
is somepony here?
yeah thats one of my biggest problems. I get easily dicouraged because I have a lot of friends who pick up new skills much faster and I get jealous and annoyed. XD
I'll likely be doing a stream of me playing later tonight if you fancy tuning in
Winter wrap-up winter wrap-up~

In almost a sacred cow fashion.
BLARGHRAGH
That article is old like wow
But yeah, not like I'm saying anything new.
I know.
oh shi--
But not all of us had read it then.
Wow. Quite full for this time of day.
<333
14Been SO long since I've watched this show
:)
DARKWING DUCK
I know
14Lets get dangerous!
Oh wow
Not as cool as Ducktales.
Sathi: /)^3^(\
Nostalgia trip
8all my nostalgia
It's a look back, and still a classic example of um...
Cooler than~
It's only the second worst example of MLP-related research though
Lets get dangerous!
It's nostalgia day.
so? Everything is okay?
Hipster_Brony, we watched an episode or two of Duck Tales yesterday
oh lol, I think I'm lagging behind
Did you see the article in the feminist magazine
Ms?
Dick Tales
Freakazoid, Batman, Darkwing Duck.
Can we listen to the Ducktales theme?
WOOHOO
I think so
sometime later, I mean
Duck Dodgers is better
dicktales
The "Smart shaming etc etc one"
dick
tales
dicktails
Yup
that is rather old news
I think so.
So was cartoonbrew
I haven't read it in a while.
Darkwing Dick
Let's get dangerous.
i just hear that
Still, it's always nice to look at that stuff from to time
It's still a classic example of how to be ignorant.
MLP history
That's not the only scent in the air ;D
eheheheheh~
The other scent is dickfumes
Duck can be changed into several different offensive words with only one letter of difference.
because he's darkwing dick
Darkwing Dick, Darkwing Fuck
BREAKFAST
(You learn these things when your usual game alias has the word Duck in it)
Who does the voice?
You know, I think that it's a testament to the show's strength that it has overcome the MLP stigma. So says Mr Repetition.
Me
I'm the voice actor for Darkwing Duck.
This is how I have my breakfast o:
That explains everything.
hey guys :p
But it's still true, and it's still fun to remember and reflect.
How unrealistic
And remind ourselves of just what we are a part of.
Everyone knows toast lands butter side down
As a featureless box, I have the best pokerface in the universe. Fun fact there.
..
They banned me from Las Vegas and most of Nevada.
im lost, what are you talkin about?
O^O
Don't worry, I don't know either
RAMROD
I've been watching loads of Legend of Galactic Heroes these days
actually taht article just goes to show you the sorry state of feminism in this country. Instead of looking towards real issues where people are actually getting unfair shakes you analyze a cartoon and try to bring out hidden offenses.
dat grammar
To be fair, it's the sorry state of one feminist
And they did publish Faust's rebuttal
Oh, yea, I forgot most of you guys are new and/or late. I'm a box.
Not always, Meanwhile
Your stay in Prison
He's inside me.
My toast always landed butterside down, so i don't eat it any more.
It suits his businees perfectly
so, one feminist try to shot down MLP?
kinky
Yeah, without ever watching it
I've encountered more than a few people who remind of that stance. I'm just saying there are people who want to do the right thing but are so eager to fight the good fight they have emotional, knee-jerk reactions to percieved slights.
LUGGAGE
I have no problem with feminism, except when it attempts to undermine guys and give them no credit.
Of course, the same can be said for the other extreme when women get no credit.
Do you think birdwatcher and stalker mean the same thing in that city?
somepony have the article, i want to read it
In other words, you have nothing against feminism, you have something against people being dumbasses
MAAAANDARRRRK
14Dat Mandark
IT'S MAAAAANNNNDDDARRRKKKK
AHA
AHAHA
HA
HA
sorry for the bad english by the way
HAAA
*lightning*
I thought everyone had something against people being dumbasses.
hey, like me
[someone being a dumbass]http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/09/my-little-homophobic-racist-smarts-shaming-pony/
Yeah, but I think it helps to distinguish whether you have something against feminism per se or people being dumbasses
People can try to be feminists and be dumbasses about it, in that case, the offending behavior is being a dumbass, not being a feminist

yay Pinkie Pie styling went well!
I sometimes mistake the front of the plane for the back.
I only read the original article once, but I reread Faust's bit several times because she's being so awesome in it

go outside, set fire to yourself, film it, post on internet

I'd have it too, if it weren't for my brother moving out and taking the xBox with him~ Say, could this be viewed by modded xBoxs?
wat
how bout, no

fire only hurts if it doesn't respect you
What do you guys think of Skyrim appearing exclusively on the XBox 360 for 30 days before appearing elsewhere?
wow that was a really good answer fomr Faust
She does sound like him now that I think about it.
I mad, bro. PC gamer for life.
it's the smoke that really kills you faster
Don't care about the game myself, but timed exclusives suck.
Is there any confirmation of Derpy becoming a real character in Season 2?
Lauren could've said "bitch, please." and it would've gotten the same reaction.
XD
Hai

Derpy_Hooves: no, but she's already more or less canon, she just doesn't have a spoken name yet.
Lauren Faust has a vague idea what she's doing
As in, nopony in the show has said who she is.
I'm playing Deus Ex Human Revolution.
Developers/publishers love the 360.
Ok
7NEXT UP: Pinky and the brain
I hope she does lol

Hopefully, the name Derpy will stick

So spoilers plz. I just got the game today.
Funny thing: I can't think of any major title coming out that is allowing mods.
radio shack still exists?
Skyrim should, like all of the Oblivions and Fallouts.
apparently.
You want spoilers?
radio shack?
No.

Invisible War was a sequel. This is a prequel.
WhatPayne, I have it for PC.

Was Invisible War that bad?
the first one was a table flip

I did play a "game" called "Invisible Wars," but it's very clear that it was just a troll

Invisible War was prfoundly meh. If it hadn't been a sequel to Deus Ex it probably wouldn't have as bad a reputation as it does.
Invisible War wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as good as the first.
I suppose it passes through the server, then outputs the rest. I see the text fine, but some of you dont?

Winamp
like in "winamp"
winamp, been a long time since I used that program ha
a media player
I use winamp, for music only
has some awesome skin
I always used winamp
so, out of curiosity, who is controlling the stream right now?
I used winamp for years
Yeah, it had some good cartoons though in the early to mid 90's
winamp seems to lag videos for me
the girl mod, i think?
FluffyWuffs: why did ou ask "winamp ?" ?
I never used it for videos
/me 7nods
7that be me
cause you spelled it "Wunump"
mplayer/vlc are far much better
XD
I love mplater!
0legasp
smplayer/umplayer
for videos, hmm, what did I use
bsasasa
wat
first was windows media player, then realplayer, then back to wmp, then vlc
why u write bold
My lighting is crap right now :( http://i.imgur.com/Fh7Db.jpg
heh, I liked the older real player
7i'm sorry :(
0RobotPinkie
I tend to use VLC or MPC for video these days
meh, brushables
before they added all the gui's
0I am so jelly right now...
I still think real player was just ahead of its time
OH MY GOD YES http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lduriab8ahs&feature=player_embedded#!

FluffyWuffs: exactly !
VLC! Woo! MPC! Woo!
Sathi, it's okay. But if you knock out my internet, or flood my house, I'ma be uber pissed.
I'm sorry ValtheWizard
0YOU SHOULD BE PINKIE

I never gave VLC player a try yet
its never about who gets it first. its about who does it the best

WHAT WOULD BRIAN BOITANO DO?
I never could get VLC player to work right.
I just use WMP with codecs installed
i always loved light apps
/me plays the outer limits theme
VLC can be finicky sometimes. Older versions were
wrong chan :)
well if you buy Luna, I'll be jelly of you, ValtheWizard
New or old Outer Limits?
SHOO BEE DOO SHOOP SHOO BEE DOO
also, mplayer.
VLC works fine for me, /shrug

Hurray, Theramin!

I loved 98

I must have used ME for 4 years before I decided to switch to xp

when will he be posting us?
hearing him saying pinky over and over again is just making me think of pinkie pie more and more
Oh wow.
Pinky only has eyes for one equine.
Is the stream dying for anyone else?
You're not the only one who has Pinkie on the brain, MeteorVenture
lol dat pun
I..... totally should've done that differently
7Our brain is full of ponies
Looks like you have... *puts on sunglasses* ...Pinkie... on the brain.
0it is for me herospirit, but that's because I'm on my university's library wi-fi which is complete shit
This cartoon is so very politically correct
Dat lipsynch joke.
I am enjoying this thoroughly.
7Who requested the Looney tunes?
This is an amazing show
Yes it is!
watched it as a kid
I want to watch my Luna tunes.
I watched it a lot too.
Lol at the sandals.
also watched some shows that I don't know if I'd like so much anymore...
like James Bond Jr.
I should request that :P
7Don't think we have time for that
That's okay
i wonder how many people are still in the building
NONE NOW.

WAIT.
But wouldn't the Earth's orbit be completely desimated and and and. oh whatever
Sotha beat me to the question.
he didnt say in the email, but im guessing around 6
Who the hell is that guy anyway
I don't see.
Who knows.
Sotha, only if the entire universe wasn't upsized too, including the laws of physics.
I received feedback from other viewers they wanted to be alerted earlier. Is there anything we can do about that?
I don't think you can 'upsize' physics.
I know. This is called 'handwaving', Meanwhile.
You can't
Hello mah bronies
But
hey HeavyMetalPony
I was under the impression handwaving was a form of greeting
0hello HeavyMetalPony
Heyho HeavyMetalPony
Facebook just can't handle my little ponies.

When I was in the Shakespeare play, my director said whoever got his reference to Pinky and the Brain would be the first name on the show catalog.
for once he got something right
I won :trollface:

Derpy: So Bran, what are we going to do tonight? *derp*. --- Bran: The same thing we do every night, Derpy; try to take over the world!
Space Jam? Wasn't that the movie with Bugs Bunny and the basket ball? Wasn't that movie already streamed a few MONTHS ago?
^
NASA needs billions to go to the moon. Orbiter is free.
yes it was
That's the one.
Exactly
So it needs to wait until 6 months have passed then
I feel suffering.
7eeeyup
It's still amazing.
I remember that being the rule about duplicate movies
Space Jam is the basis for the best RPG ever made.
Would The Big Lebowski be considered a B movie or A movie?
So is LOTR starting at 7?
can't wait until we can watch the room again
Barkley, Shut up and Jam: Gaiden.
Btw, what movie night is this? I lost count at around movie night 12 I think.
Ersatz: :p
Oh God, yes, best RPG ever
I pretty much called the room then missed it'stream
A basketball RPG?
hehehe
I think it's 15 tonight.
Sounds boring
You have no idea.
What was that movie with gene whatsisface as Frankenstein?
Darken_Skye: 7pm EST
It's amazing
Gene Wilder
I'm looking towards to the day CUBE will be the B-movie.
i think my first movie night was with the room
thought it was 16...
young frankenstien
Young Frankenstein
You'd think i'd remember that
Young Frankenstein was also streamed before
I know, it was awesome.
yeah.
is there any sound?
We'll figure it out when it gets posted on EqD later. :p
we need to watch blazing saddles some night
*listening to Welcome Home by Coheed and Cambria while watching Loony Toons*
Were you there then?
I was.
We shoudl totaly have a list of pervious streams
I think I have a list somewhere
agreed
0Dumori: I know Silverscreen made one a while back
Dermathil, Cube could actually be viewed as good, Cube 2 was seen by me with 8 other guys, We had never laughed so much in years.
0where it is, I couldn't tell you
Yeah but on the site so we can alkl see it
dat defiance of gravity
lol, cartoon physics you so crazy
Maybe, HMP, but the movie is still a cult classic and as such qualifies for B
back. what'd i miss?
7wb Wrek
Wrek, you missed Pinky and the Brain
You missed the Brain song
and wb
0welcome back wreck
>mfw I remember the Disney WW2 propaganda...
silly bugs, just get fluttershy to hug them
0wrek* even
7brain song was actually pretty good
lol, this chat is so different from the 2pm streams, and the movie hasn't even strated yet.
brain song is epic...
EEEEYUP HMP.
srsly though, can anyone hear anything?
Yes RP.
Nope
i can hear it
i hear voices...
:P
0I can hear the voices in my head. Does that count?
i judt hope that MLP:FiM doesn't get a messed up idea of physics like some old cartoons (such as what we're watching)
lol
maybe refresh stream^
I think it's really, really quiet.
The great thing about Looney Tunes is that there are so many episodes there always exists one you've never seen.
soudns fine for me
MV, they do at times.
YOu forgot pinkie pie
windows sounds
7<< boosted sounds any better?
0MeteorVenture lol, watch Feeling Pinkie Keen again and watch the Fluttershy with a cart scene :P
lol
Sounds are fine for me
Yeah a bit better, I cranked up my volume a bit too
droped a bit hear by my rig is wacky with sounds
lol good point val.. i did see that
thank you Sathi :3
Make 'Em Laugh
7your welcome
don't you know everyone wants to laugh
We should totally watch Singin' in the Rain one night.
mlp already violates the laws of physics all the time
Here is a list of all the previous movie nights http://mibpaste.com/1TSJX6
my dad said "be an actor, my son. but be a comical one"
also, did we watch g3.5 last night?
cool I've only missed 3 and i was her form stream 2
Only I've missed were 2-4 and last weeks
i think there was some g3.5, interior_gummy
it was brilliant
so was the the B cartoon?
though i might be thinking of the day before....
that*
in week 8, they both seem like b movies (funny ones, but still)
I can't wait until we'll be able to choose between S1 episodes and S2 episodes for brony nights
I am reminded of when the super mario bros movie was on. talk about artistic liberties.
i mean G3.5 made me wonder what would happen if there was an A movie and a B movie.. and then an A cartoon (MLP:FiM) and a B cartoon
Anyone remember the Bugs Bunny cartoon that was basically Invasion of the Body Snatchers/Pod People
No, but I've probably seen it.
Carrots from space came down and replaced the other characters with defective copies...
Oh ffff....
Purple
I was trying to forget
Are they still streaming cartoons every sunday night on synchtube?
ironic that the texas cowboy is a muslim now
Yosemite might be the best character
We are thinking of the trouser pissing creepy episode, correct?
daffy is best character
brb, gotta piss for two minutes straight
dat aim
wait no, wile is best
Manly walking is manly
Alright! So we're at Night 16!

I know this show thanks to Nostalgia Critic
interior_gummy: Twilight happens.
I think it's early 90's
i think i was apparently supposed to remember this show
but i don't
4Mid 90's I believe
honestly, too young to remember much before around ren & stimpy
and what a beautiful show it was
Ren and Stimpy is older than this
I guess it aired here on the nickelodeon channel... it hasn't been around that long
it was the newer episodes of that show
No one has ever won a competition about lawn with flamingoes on it.
The Adventures of Pete & Pete (TV Series 1993–1996)
Yeh when i was that age i was watching spooks of bottle bay.
but Ren and Stimpy had reruns long after this ended
TF is this?
The Adventures of Pete and Pete
oh gosh they're southern
It's...odd

I kinda like Trixie, she's a funny character
She looks like Chloe Moretz
she's not even close to Mane 6, though
Fan interpretation made me think Trixies a douche
If she shows up in season 2 she has 5 minutes to make herself look like she isn't.
she could be...

I don't think she'll be in Season 2

Get your head in the game, Phoenix!
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You're here because we need your help. We know that you've been contacted by a certain individual, a man who calls himself Gandalf. Now, whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
thanks deadly_pony
I'd watch the matrix if gandalf was in it

quick book him on assulte
My colleagues believe that I'm wasting my time with you, but I believe you wish to do the right thing. We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. And all that we're asking for in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Agent_Smith, You're on the wrong boat, methinks.
