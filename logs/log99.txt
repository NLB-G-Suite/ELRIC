On top of the 5.9 that happened Tuesday.
14Why couldnt it come when I lived in NY? Grrr.
Or in Irene.
I'd take shelter in a concrete hotel.
Yes.
you guys are on edge. I'm a little bit wierded out. but it's cool. everyone's got their own taste.
...wrong movie.
and oreos!
14Really bad storms, but dont think they were classified as hurricanes. Not sure,
14Upstate NY isnt really known for them as far as I know. :P
14Ahh
wrong movie?
It was Hugo.
oh forgot to change my nick
/me opens the Gates of Steel

Hurricanes are really long windstorms.
I touch myself
well then
Huh
Looks like a server went down
inb4 netsplit
All you eastern US states people all ready for irene?
BRING IT ON!!
Yeah
I see no netsplit
Guess there's no netsplit then
14Sounds kinda scarey but exciting.
The quit message would've said the server.
It won't be bad for me...
Or a tornado.
ibilis redirected me, and it seems to have went boom
i was on rubicon
I loved it when I found out others loved severe weather and went after it.
I've done it three times.
Well, 4.
14Nice.
14None for me. lol
3 in KS, OK, and TX. Once in MN.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4drucg1A6Xk
Last year, I rode with experienced chasers. Helped a lot.
I sure haven't
TX is in a drought.
14Yeah, friend told me about that.
It's really good.
Ahh.
You know...
And as far west as Amarillo, TX.
uh
14Furthest west I've been is Cali. lol
I really liked exploring the plains during my first plains chase.
14Driven through the plains. Was nice. Though a little boring. :P
I have no desire to live in Cali or anything west of the Rockies.
You're right...
I loved the plains when I first saw them.
14I would live in some parts of Cali
/me punches the wall
Somehow this wall holds up
14Speaking of the Rockies, I also lived at about 9000ft in CO lol
You've been all over.
14Mhmmm
I've only lived in SC and PA.
I plan on moving out to the plains.
Either OK or MN.
14I've lived in Germany, NY, TX, NC, GA, CO, NE
14Think thats all. lol
Wow.
Well I tell you I would go back in time and go to watch this show:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T53ebC-as0
14Oh, forgot MI lol
This show had like the best live performance of "Uncontrollable Urge"
14Suddenly, lots of stories!
G'night
I might want to drive around PA some more before I leave.
14Oh yeah, forgot Arkansas too, lamo
14PA is decent
I visited Centralia, PA during my first year of stay.
I'll be surprised if that town still exists anymore.
It has a population less than this channel's member count right now.
14No idea where that is. I'd mainly been to Philly and Pitsburgh
14:P
14Heard about that somewhere of some town. Might have been that one.
14Well, I remember seeing it on some news somewhere a while back.
But it was based on Centralia.
At least the premise.
I don't know if Centralia would make the news nowadays unless it finally loses it's borough status.
14Dunno.
mmmmmm coffeee
14Just remember hearing about a town with that in the news a while back.
I don't know of any other towns with long-lasting mine fires.
Of course, I didn't know about Centralia for a long time.
mmmmm coffee and chocolate
Wow, Askpinkamina is rough this update
Yup.
I loved it.
oh yes I do to

@Xiagu: Gotta agree with that, tho.

Now we're talking about putting random pony stickers around the house.
Hurr.

Iv been researching this for like half an hour
/me dances around

Lonesome road.
yayayayayayayayayaya
...
omg
wut... I'm talking about Lonesome Road, Untamed.
I am celebrate.
That's a bit... wow, taking things too far.
If I could. I'd change my name to The Courier.
First name The. Last name Courier.
Also, Kim Fluttershy Dykas: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/brony-changes-his-name-to-fluttershy.html
/me applies sunglasses

most people wouldn't care about middle names that much

elemetry school lol

High School

I want to change my middle name to "Awesome"
I'd like to erase my middle name and just have first and last lol
"No, Danger's my MIDDLE name."</Austinpowers>
Or maybe I should change it to "adventure".
You guys are helping me procrastinate.
How is Hoenshy?
Does that make you feel good?
I haven't touched it yet.
Retsamoreh, Efreet, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change#United_States
And never read Hoenshy before.
I'm on Chapter 4 atm
I'm not stupid enough to actually change my name though.
it took me 80$ and 30 minutes
?
I know, right?

I want to change my name
First comment = Lol'd
I was told it's $350
It took me $10 and about the same amount of time, but it wasn't a deliberate name change. :P
depends on the state you were born in, etc..
because i did not like my middle name
Eh.
i kept my last name, changes first and middle
they put my first, middle, and the first half of my last name in the First Name field
and the second half of my last name in the Last Name field
Stupid family tradition dictates the father has to use his first name as his firstborn son's middle name.
Hahaha.
I quite like my name.
Didn't know until security told me it didn't match.
stupid sexist traditions
I like my name as well.
Hows'it sexist?
…wait, I'm still ^BlacklightShining?!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mCojSVaji4
I mean, it's not really that sexist.
I'll start you off.
TxP

FRT?

Is this the place that they're showing Lord of the Rings/Ponies?
EF
TxP = One letter off.
Yes
It'll depend on my wife, I suppose.

TQ
hnnngh >:I
Tenaris: on Equestria Daily?
My name is TJP.
Well, Initials.
if I get married, I'm taking my wife's last name
BlacklightShining: eyup
because the second half sucks and the first half is borrowed from a bunch of generations ago
yeah, my girlfriend is mexican and thats how they do it
/me 's last name = meh
He got made fun of for it cause it was quite long.
Thanks
Twin Quarry = First and Last name's meaning.
Make me a middle name.

BlacklightShining: odds are it wont appear all the time
Oh

more like playful between pinkie and rainbow, but that's just my opinion
I like 7 and 12 alot
12 is really nice, scenery that looks really well done
NyanCatxRainbowDash
23 is hilarious.
Not enough sweater dresses..

@Shaico's friend: Well, have you watched it?
it has a diverse cast whose personalities play off each other in interresting ways
Charactorization
CUTENESS
Pinkie Pie.
Yeah, cuteness factors into it.
Incredibly great voice acting.
The fandom is awesome (most of it)
The show's first director actually had a vison, and she did all in her power to acomplish it
Snark. There's a lot of snarkiness in the characters.
Did she succed?
Twilights purple.
I think it is safe to say that most of us here wouldsay yes
The songs are great.
But intelligent reaons aside
oh really?
Neither, Coz.
the show makes me laugh something good
Twilight Thparkleth is definitely the gayest.
Ponies>4chan
Twilight Snarkle > all ponies
AND HOW
My friend is annoying.

*about it
Kingdom hospital
oh ya one the funner ones we got
not to mention being hit by cars
or was it a SUV or Van or something that he was hit by
Wasnt thinking of Christine
but Christine is the reason I didnt get my drivers licence till I was 32
While I'm near 30 and don't have a licence not because I'm scared of cars, but because I'm scared of the stupid people in those cars.
I 'm 16 and don't my license (trys to fit in)
thank you, AlphaOmega.
/me has had a license since she was 15.
Pinkie Pie took the CMC into a flashback
... is it odd I'm more comfortable driving Go-karts at like 40 mph than a SUV at 10?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMAhCCZDwtU
I have a learners. I've had the learners for about 10 years now. I actually had to renew my learners. Kinda ridiculous, right?
yes
I've had mine for several months, nothing too weird
Learners makes a good ID card
it does, yes
But not for passports
I learned that the hard way
OK not done that.... I just had it expire in another country
You assume correctly.
milkbags?
I buy milk in jugs or cartons.
Well he could be from the UK
The UK isn't on North American continent...
He already said he was canadian
Ya I didn't see you say the thing about the same continent
I don't think I was here.
!link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyTlVIaOEjU
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
When I lost my passport, we'd only actually needed passports for the States for a couple years. We used to not need a passport to travel to the US.

I never actually owned an Xbox until relatively recently, a 360 even more recently, and Xbox Live more recently than that

Looks like Subversion got uninstalled and forgot to tell Apache the news
hey guys
Don't get between that!

hi there
'ello there Bill!
Think more Sondheim
"Sunday"
/me stares blankly.
You know Rarity's song in "Suited For Success?"
That was based off of a song from the musical "Sunday in the Park with George"
That song is about 20% cooler than Rarity's other song.
Well, that musical has another song in it called "Sunday," and it's really, really good.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVO9rN5Bk1A
Both of those songs were based off of Sondheim pieces.

Coloring a pony-related pic now.

They drive me to enjoy things that I would not have seen myself enjoying a few months ago.
ffffffffuuuuuuuu
Like things that we as adults are sorta "forbidden" for us to enjoy anymore
I colored her dress wrong T_T
We must be mature and have jobs.
Buy homeware and appliances, have children.

And giving people plausible deniability
Episode 8: Look Before you Sleep
I like this one :3
Going to sleep, good night, ttyl.
Night.

Freudian slip, perhaps?
/me leans forwards
But my buddy is refusing to go to sleep
Watches as FallSilently falls on their face
Punch him.
Done
Now, ask him nicely to go to sleep.
Hes playing tf2
Oh
It worked
Nah, but, pull out his ethernet cable or something.
you know really sucks when you are playing TF2? damn modem shuts down
They're hoping you're gullable enough to be scared by an authority
I wouldn't worry about it
Loll
I rarely get that problem
you know me
Yeah I know you're not :P

auuuugh
Yep.
Hey. Radimir.
wat
I never got exams this year.
or ever.
u jelly?
Ja.
;3
I got a.. Math's assignment this week..
Once those three are finished. I've finished Maths for the year.
These are pretty much the last set of exams that actually matter, too.
harharhar
Well. The only "Exam" I'm having is a Food Tech one..
But I don't really care for it.
I only had two options to pick from. Food Tech or D&T
D&T = Design and Tech, right?
Yeah.
That's the only subject that I don't actually have an exam for.
I'm horrible at both.
Lots of assignments due for it, though.
haha
It's probably actually my best subject
Particularly since I actually tried this year.
And, in saying that, I'm pretty sure that I'm the best in the subject in my grade.
end up imagining my fingers sprawled over a cutting board.
and me running around the room screaming.
:<
I don't really get that in tech.
D:
Also. Listening to MK theme.
You have to grip is really hard to prevent it from just going everywhere.
Well, Day, I should say.
Hmm.
I would say...
November 18.
November 11th here.
Skyriiiiiiiiiiim
Ooh
Thinking Imperial.
I'm probably gonna go
Argonian
...
Efreet..
I agree
Gonna have to ask my Dad/Sister to take me up to Geraldton to get it from EBGames.
On the way up to Geraldton, I'll be giddy.
Yeah
On the way back, I'll be Pinkie Pie.
Particularly the orcs.
Radimir.
2nd character shall be a Nord.
Blonde hair.
Blue eyes.
Guess his name.
Thor?
hi5
/me high fives Radimir
/me returns this.

Radimir.

for me :)
I'm going to totally..
THen I shall pick pocket them all.
if you say "use AT&T to spite you" you'll just be doing yourself a disservice
Make it happen.
I can't wait to fight unscripted dragons.
Oh, definitely.
Closely followed by the mod to make everyone look like an anime character.
And then, the pony mod.
Yes.
Afternoon, Sharksky.
;D
:3
It's noon here.
I know, you live in Australia.
You mean Deathstralia.
More like
Western Australia.
Oh wait, same thing.
.. eff u >:C
I'll be moving over to Bendigo in a few years, according to my parents.
Once all my dental work and shiz are finished at PMH.
Sans title!
I still maintain my theory
Oh right.
Put him into over drive
that too.
And hello, SharkSky.
i can't even load it up :<
I wish that it did not exist.
then dont play it?
Oh hey, Radimir.
I'm just saying
It looks... Awful.
I'm just saiyan.
oh
look delicious
And then stopped.
Damn it all!
Radimir: I saw it, I lol'd.
elohel
There's a mental image none of us needed D:
Don't pretend I'm not partially right.
Oh I'm not denying it
Just saying didn't need to think about it ;_;
Have some news.
Then, out of nowhere, 'applejack money'.
To add mystery, the file is called, 'applemoneyassbag.png'.
because..
Applejack currency is the best currency.
Next to Pinkie Pie currency, atleast.
Fluttershy currency is worthless, since she just hands it out to whoever needs it.
Dat Applejack money
Damn socialist.
Or, perhaps that's Rarity, since she's the Element of Generosity.
Wat.
Nopenopenope.
?
You heard me.
I read you. But I didn't hear you.
/me trollfaces
And there is another holiday today as well, but mentioning them together...it'd just be in poor taste.
Women's Equality Day today?.
Yes.
wait
women havea day?
Yeah
news to me!
Next thing you'll know
They'll want to vote.
they'll have a weekend!
Then.. a week..

The OPs are asleep let's be evil.

Hahahahahaha!
Muffincupcakes.
Cupfins
Muffincakes.
Fuck I'm now sad, I had a bad thought due to reading that combination of words.
wut?
Let's discuss pretty ponies.
Muffincupcakes.
Like Rarity. :3c
Pinkie Pie is not crazy.
She's just hyper.
I dislike this very much.
In place of-
Efreet: And clairvoyant.
/me wonders why he is sad now...
That too.
Holiday!
Time for ponies!
Oh, dear.
/me twitches.
<3
Hehehe.
Are you doing this on purpose
;(
Just to tease you. :3
Maybe.
Larscis: NOOOOOOO!
I most certainly not like a butt.

but I already did....
Landsharks.
Ponies worst enemies.
Sharksky: I just had a talk with the ships computer. It hates me.
Grr newfags everywhere.
The anatomy in that picture is... Questionable.
gneifsoeif
I landshark, therefore I am.
How ever shall you go on, Shaico?
Pinkie Pie..
Landsharks worst enemy.
And that landshark is eating Twilight's plot.
Which is somehow extending greatly beyond her rear legs.
idgi
>idgi
i don't get it?
i think
Makes sense.
What'd I tell ya? Newfags. :(
hay. i'm not a newfag.
I'm still not entirely sure how you define somebody as a newfag, Shaico.
Newfags. Y'know.
there's a difference!
Watch ponies.
I want to watch season 2 already.
Or, play with loaded guns.
Shaico.
With that comment..
Stop pinging me.
You have just delayed Season 2 by a week.
Play with Loaded guns, start cleaning it. Ignore the chambered round.
No I didn't.
Radimir: I prefer to launch things with my trebuchet.
they have yet to announce it.
It's confirmed, Efreet.
Yeah they did.
ffffffff-
Oh stop being such a saddle sore.
xD
Shaico: OH YOU.
Hehehe.
inb4lonesomeroad'sdelayed.
Yes, stop being such an adjective.
o.O
Hey guys.
The Lonesome Road...
Don't care about Lonesome Road.
Ponies!
Delayed? NO!
Go on.
The end. Kinda sucks.
Oh.
Nah, my 360 first broke.
And I was like, "Meh, screw it."
Shaico..
You are 15 years old.
You are not a man.
BUT A BOY!
End on the 14th of October.
I enjoyed my NES
Fine, boy works as well.
I have 2 weeks worth of school to go through.
Wait, Shaico is 15?
Yes, I am Radimir.
Problem?
Yes.
This actually explains quite a bit.
There is a large problem here.
/me is now questioning his morals.
Sharksky.
CHLOROFORM!
CHLOROFORM!
And Radimir, you only saw me call people newfags once or twice today.
/me shoves a rag in Efreet's throat!
ohgodwha
I hardly think I have an affinity to call people newfags.
O.O
/me slumps down ontop of Sharksky and crushes him
Oh, hey, it's Lunasta.
And hi Lunasta! :o
I'm judging Shaico because he's younger than me.
Meh. I don't care that much, really.
Shaico :D
/me hugs Shaico
/me hugs Lunasta.
You can't leave!

Well congrats then.
You have been taught well.
Hurr
Hmmm...
Dammit, I'm leaking spots
They are legendary.
Gotta write more
We should discuss
Shaico, what's legendary? :3
Something mildly-controversial.
omg controversy
>:U
But I want to wait for Tropico 4, first.
Yes Lunasta ?
When is it released?
You called?
Uhh
2nd, I think.
2nd of Sept?
Yes.
However!
Go on.
/me wants to know more.
/me leers at Fireant while muttering something indistinct under his breath
/me hugs Lunasta.
There there.
Balloons, don't you dare.

Anyone have the links to stats?
/me hugs Shaico "Nein Fireant! Shai, let us be nonmods together :D"

Done.

Oh.
That's right.

Tiny-ass cars
No
Larger then SUVs

Our spiders have manabars.
But have you ever seen one of them fight a drop-bear?
no
i haven't.

haha
Man, we don't have any good mythical animals here

It's too hilarious to be scary.
IIRC, Ogopogo is a protected species though, just in case

Well, good luck then
I just got my preordered Deus Ex the other day, and I am LOVING it

Leonon: just got it THE OTHER DAY
Been playing it nearly non-stop since, lol
Wow, did it get lost in the mail?
it's been out since like 2001
06 was drek, though. Take two steps forward and another five-minute loading screen boots up.
Yeah 06 was the only one where I agreed with people.
Exept that one mission that's really hard withought using the moter cycle
And that Cool Edge day music - sheer awesome.

Yep, but there are people like that you know, and it's commendable in my opinion

;-; The last of the Amblin Entertainment cartoons of the 90s
I've been to Gettysburg... it was interesting
Hairballs? To solve that problem, include flax seed oil to their diet
PONIES!
A language most ponies do not know of
that whole solo or whatnot is AMAZING
I accidentally taught my cat a trick
luna

4I've heard that kid's voice somewhere
aww cute
ups
:3
well
lol
doesnt matter
we wont win
D'awwwwwwwwwwwww
That, or shes really a pushover
I usually don't prefer female cats
But, but :'(
most of them are bi*ches...
male cats are more awesome
Not if you have my cats
(and the last link is not valid)
I have a he and a she though
how many cats you got?
he might just be the same VA
crazy cat people
doubt it since they're both voiced by boys
Cats are cuuute
are they?
and ponies!
Uh
Dogs are boring when they are old
I use to raise dogs ;]
Howdy-doo.
especially Budgerigars
G'day
Most women voicing boys sound weird like Bart Simpson. or Phil from Rugrats
PHEW, Pinkie finally done
this is amazing though o.o
just need to dry now
oh it's dryig :3
drying *
I'll take pics when it's dry, I don't have hairdryer though =C
Birds
I'll let it stand in front a low energy light bulb for a couple of hours :P
I use to have finches
4Boo, the South lost *thumbs down*
lol
They were reproducing like crazy...
I had to give like, 20 away...
XD
I used to breed finches, canaries and quails
nice
I don't have any pet :(
lol I probably should've done the front of the mane last, I just realized...
jk i have
No wait, that's me
when we had 40 we desided maybe breeding them wasn't the best idea
I only help to take care of some ponies at a friends' farm on summer holidays
that baby scares me
it's larger than the children!
But I don't really like real-life ponies
4FUCK YEAH, VIKINGS
5^
4YINGER HINGER DINGER
/me pillages and burns
lol
BY ODIN...I MEAN CELESTIA'S BEARD!
I think rl horses would be really harts too take care of
wow Daz :P
4They didn't give a fuck
mind you that was after they each had one clutch of eggs
lol
Well, maybe next time I style a pony
gah, 40!?
thats a lot
i can tell that this is OLD lol
hey there User_{numbers here}
wow
at least old for me
yeah... they weren't wanting for food
MeteorVenture = Only about 8 or 9 years old.
5what is this faggotry
Yep, the voice of Loud Kiddington was some producer's kid.
well ya that's old for me lol.. i'm only 19:P
5mfw greenland flashed aswell when they said island
I was thinking Austrian, but yeah
5iceland*
The friend i was talking about really reminds me of applejack
haha this song is awesome
4I can't watch this
4It's getting me more and more pumped for Skyrim
I can't clop to this :(
lol
inb4 NOS FU DAAAAAAAAAAA
amen
4Why do you suck at them/
4*?
NOSWAITH DDA, VAL
oh wait...
MeteroVenture: Eeenope
meteor* even
5Im sorry, but this is insulting
4Yeah, if it's difficulty, then you can just turn it down
5*pauses stream*
I freely admit that they're way over my head. Too much micro-managing to keep track of if you want to get really good.
all in favor of Shivering Isles being the greatest expansion ever?
lol "even".. is that a reference to snagglepuss?
>implying the previous episode wasn't :P
At least you get an episode. Where's Africa?
I'm not bagging on it. I'm glad someone is willing to make RPGs that hardcore. But I've been playing their games since Morrowind and it can take me years just to be able to survive
4Ahhh, Morrowind
and when i say no strong monsters i mean not that i have seen.. i kinda quit mid-game for a while
4BINGO
all the difficulty changes is the health and damage they do
4HAHA
11SUPRISE!
not the actual items or anything
I need to ask Twilight about that one.
4"Surprise! : D"
4"Take his stuff!!!"
5*dang*
Galadriel: you having blue text for LOTR as well?
4What a bunch of dicks XD
lol
11I might do, not sure yet
5i,e hardcore mode
5<3
4Fallout 3 isn't bad at all
I'm waiting for the GotY edition :P
bah...I give up! I can't watch the streams with this connection! *rageface*
Nice
Obsidian....grrrrr.
4But it was the same team
4Those guys made NV
I can see why they were fired
lol
4All I know is, if you're a low level character and you come across a Deathclaw, you are fucked
MeteorVenture: you mean an adjustable difficulty?>
Only thing bad about KotOR 2 was that the publisher forced them to rush it out...
4And if you're high level and have excellent equipment, you're still fucked if there's more than one Deathclaw
It wasn't until fanmade mods/patches that it was actually PLAYABLE
4I prefer KOTOR 2 over the first one
I liked KotOR 2, but it needed about 6 more months in development
KotOR 2 had the POTENTIAL to be amazing
which is why I'm glad Team Gizka finally finished the TRP
4Yeah, yeah, "KOTOR1 was amazing and wonderful and great" blah blah blah
4I get it
....
4But I'm just saying that I prefer KOTOR2
Did Team Gizka ever actually release their version? Last I heard someone else released a competing mod.
yeah, they released it
I haven't played it yet, as it's on my desktop at home
but I'm very eager
not Obsidian's fault, though... They were under contract and had to push it out
5this is the chain of events with many potentially great games
5i blame publishers
well no, there was publisher problems with KotOR II
6Discuss.
4Fuck trains
5...
choo choo!
4Trains suck
4Boo
hey everypony
chuga chuga chuga chuga CHOO CHOO
5trains ae 20% cooler than cars
6Derailing with trains ftw.
>_>
I loved the story, but it had some issues.
I liked it when it was playable
5mfw i havent played any of the games you keep mentioning
Never played it.

Man, I'm really looking forward to Skyrim...
because I was worried the moment I heard SquareEnix was getting a hand on it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7k3pubdumw
Can't wait until I get to play it in 2013 when the GotY edition is out!

Hey, Tomb Raider Legend was great

11Angry beavers is on
5enjoyed legend, never played anniversary
5or whatever it was named
Never played a Tomb Raider.
lol this stream is picking up feedback
11eeeeyup

I thought Halo 1 & 2 were great, but the 3rd one was way too buggy in single player
Hi guys
Maybe....it was that really old shooter for the Mac where you were in a maz killing...zombie...cyclops...things
lol! Nice checkpoint. :D

5source.bugnie.org is the way to go
5bungie*
the first one was okay, and I can tolerate it as the first modern shooter
I just use custom repositories, never had to download from Bungie :P
but the other games have nothing to which I can respect
Why's that Valthe?
Oh?
oh cool

Damn,.

BREAKFAST

This is how I have my breakfast o:
That explains everything.
hey guys :p
How unrealistic
Everyone knows toast lands butter side down
..
They banned me from Las Vegas and most of Nevada.
O^O
Don't worry, I don't know either
RAMROD
dat grammar
To be fair, it's the sorry state of one feminist
And they did publish Faust's rebuttal
He's inside me.
It suits his businees perfectly
Yeah, without ever watching it
LUGGAGE
I have no problem with feminism, except when it attempts to undermine guys and give them no credit.
Of course, the same can be said for the other extreme when women get no credit.
In other words, you have nothing against feminism, you have something against people being dumbasses
MAAAANDARRRRK
14Dat Mandark
IT'S MAAAAANNNNDDDARRRKKKK
AHA
AHAHA
HA
HA
sorry for the bad english by the way
HAAA
*lightning*
I thought everyone had something against people being dumbasses.
hey, like me
[someone being a dumbass]http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/09/my-little-homophobic-racist-smarts-shaming-pony/
Yeah, but I think it helps to distinguish whether you have something against feminism per se or people being dumbasses
People can try to be feminists and be dumbasses about it, in that case, the offending behavior is being a dumbass, not being a feminist
TCIF !!
ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha
Also, I'm an unbearable pedant
The best thing about that laugh, it's a palindrome.
reads the same forwards and backwards
works for me

it hasnt been entered into IRC correctly
I can't get on that fuckin' website
No, its the website that's not loading

but it's loading too
Like I said, that's Faust's rebuttal
I know how to make it a palindromic laugh: Ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha ahahahaha ahaha
It's pretty awesome
I sometimes mistake the front of the plane for the back.
yea
somepone have the answe from Faust?
faust dealt with those numitz very quickly and has a shit ton of support behind her
Silfer: Yeah

Invisible War wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as good as the first.

it was brilliant
though i might be thinking of the day before....
that*
No, but I've probably seen it.
Purple

Oh my, heres a sho I have not seen in ages.
4No wait
4Nevermind
4This is the 4th of July ep
I don't.
don't think this aired over here...
I never heard of this show
I don't think I've ever seen this show.
5it did, a very show while
i don't remember this
5shirt*
5short**
it looks mid 90's or something
I think it's early 90's
i think i was apparently supposed to remember this show
but i don't
4Mid 90's I believe
honestly, too young to remember much before around ren & stimpy
Ren and Stimpy is older than this
I guess it aired here on the nickelodeon channel... it hasn't been around that long
it was the newer episodes of that show
No one has ever won a competition about lawn with flamingoes on it.
The Adventures of Pete & Pete (TV Series 1993–1996)
Yeh when i was that age i was watching spooks of bottle bay.
but Ren and Stimpy had reruns long after this ended
TF is this?
