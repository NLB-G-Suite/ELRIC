That image echoes through my mind,Bouncing left and right, Up and down..
/me appears before Fluttershy`. SLAP! HUG!

I can think of many more discriptors, Splooge

'Night herospirit

SNAP OUT OF IT
/me loads knife with ammo
ok then
/me loves and tolerates Fluttershy'
/me pulls out a machete
/me power hug
Well, if we go that route, he has to make sure to yell out "et tu, Fluttershy`?" as he gasps his last
I'm ready
08,01the next time he takes a step in here...
08,01kill him...
08,01STABBY!!!

inb4 something we already saw about 10 minutes ago
I'm too lazy to kill him...
hub is too cool
/me preping to call Surprise to change everyponies aditude
3Denied_Existence is not responsible for Flutterpsycho, FlutterRage, random thrall creation, mindflaying, or homicide.
Hub plays the most badass movies. *nostalgias*
I am though
So send me all of your hatemail!
/me deep stare at Revolver.
08,01do you get the plan or not?!
Remember, I caused this!
3Remember: Denied_Existence, my logic may be insane, but soon you will be too!
I do!
/me pops out of pack and stealt hugs!
Of course. If I'm online, of course.
That's why I have a machete!
/me sends love and tolerating mail to Revolver
this song is epic
love this song
Why are we killing him again, btw? Is it for The Last Airbender?
Shrek 2(which was crap, tbh) and Bandits :P
'cuz I'm completely onboard with that reason
inb4 that movie must not be played here againn
/me 3©1993
which one, Splooge?
Real life action
The one played at 2:00 PM
ah
Oh, so that is the reason?
Okay, totally okay with the murder plan then.
3No, Silvermane, not Silverscreen
Oh. Close enough.
Im getting a little bored of AMVs and PMVS
3You can blame Silverscreen for "The last airbender" I think
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kyDa5JVGFk
08,01I WILL KILL HIM
3Peddle your music elsewhere!
08,01THAT CHEATING BAST**D
Never!
also
They both have Silver in 'em. Which reminds me of the second Fantastic Four movie. Which fills me with annoyance. Ergo, murder is probably okay. Probably.
I think you censored that wrong
Good night.
night, Vee
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB_Olb-wLxc
Oh, wow, it's 2 AM EST? Huh. Couldn't tell.
3Shoo! Shoo I say!
NEVAR!
I should hit the hay myself. G'night everypony
oh yeah this one

08,01KILL KILL KILL
3Goodnight CriticKitten...if you find Silvermane Dead in the morning, please call the cops.

Fluttershy', stop, you're making me cry :'(

Will do! ....maybe.
08,01no...
Please? :(
08,01no.... -puts her head in her hands-
/me hugs Fluttershy` for good measure before sleeping
Pweese?
08,01-shakes her head, sobbing-

Who am I
Oh.
Welp, after I'm done killing myself via pony sadness, I'll sleep.
But I'm only halfway through this thread, so I'll probably still be here for an hour or so....
/me 3is willing to cheer up Natleyn.
08,01.....
I doubt anything could help me right now, but I sincerely appreciate the sentiment, Denied_existence
3:D
:3
08,01............;_____;
/me there there
/me pats Fluttershy` on the back
/me 8sniffles. "How could he...?"
that's just how some ponies are, nothing anypony can do
hwhat
Waiting for that evil laugh~
lololol
meme faces
Run, Luna! Run! D:
This is my video
at least she has company this time XD
LMAO
BEEYETCH
3I did not say i couldn't cheer you up too Fluttershy`!
3I would hug you...but I have the sneaking suspicion you might beat me with a stick...
3Meh, worth the risk
/me 3hugs Fluttershy`
/me hugs Fluttershy'
/me 8twitches
3Hmm...well I guess I can move my mindfuck count up to 2....
/me hugs Fluttershy` again
3First SuperBrony, now fluttershy....
superbrony was here

You mindfucked SuperBrony? O_o
3Not like that you dirty girl!
Welp,Im tired everypony.
Good nigh.

*night*

/me hugs SploogeTheFish goodnight
Sleep well!
I will see you tomorrow guys
3Good night
3And yes, I mindfucked Superbrony by messing with his logic in every way possible.
Denied_Existence: what do the +'s mean/
?
I'm pretty tired too, so I'm gonna go hit the hay
3It means we have voice/halfop
Night everypony
ah
night Fluttershy`
whoops
/me hugs Flutterz goodnight
3Goodnight Flutterz, and don't let me mind fuck you if you don't want to be a thrall
Sleep well!
night Flutterz
/me 8hands Fluttershy` a knife
08,01>>
08,01tabfail
08,01XD
hey Denied_Existence try to mindfuck me
Fluttershy`: did same thing
/me 8hands Flutterz a knife
lol
thanks, I guess
3At this rate, I might beat Discord in the villain primary!
nah
08,01be prepared -whispers it-
just don't do anything you'll regret while I'm gone, okay Fluttershy'? :)
try to bloody mind fuck me DE
just try it
I fucking dare you
My body is ready, D_E.
08,01okay
/me has a moon cannon in case of emergencies.
3I could try, but your stubbornness and refusal to accept even the truth might hamper things
08,01maybe
and a minigun.
nah
good song
I can accept the truth
Funny thing, is that the first time i ever heard this song was on a different pony video.
3Did you know I can walk through two doors at once?
well
it is possible
I suppose.
3Go ahead, how do you think it is?
Would portals count as doors?
3I am talking about in our universe.
2 doors right in front of each other so that you would go through both of them when you would step through them
done
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
D_E, DOOR WITHIN A DOOR
YOU MUST GO DEEPER
3No, I would be going through one door first if it was like that Revolver
is that really your mindfuck?
well
then
doorception maybe?
3Nope, our universe, remember.
like a door within a larger door
no u cant yes i can
ah this song
Doors within doors exist here :l
3Two /regular/ doors
08,01two doors face each other in a hallway! you stretch your legs so you are spread out in both doorways
CAAAAAN
3Nope, still wrong
meh
fuck it
yes i can
3Any more guesses, or should I explain it?
nope chuck testa
explain my good sir
Go for it.
08,01wait
08,01no
08,01never mind
I was never good at riddles so I'm practiced at not giving a shit.
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII CANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
08,01thought I had it
3...
3You can what?
He's singing with the stream, bro.
NO not this song. I can't understand the words!
pinkiepieswear :D
is this really the mindfuck that made FLuttershy` go crazy?
3Oh, derp
/me anti-mindfucks Fluttershy`
3No, that was a completely different mindfuck
all better
3This is the one that drove SB insane
I want to hear that mindfuck
Pinkie mother fucking Pie Swear up in this biatch
08,01I'm actually MP, not Fluttershy` her mind retreated elsewhere
Welcome, MP.
'ello MP
3Anyway Explanation starts with a question: If you are inside a building, how do you get out?
through a door
or a window
or wall
3Yes, but what do you call that for?
3door*
bluh i need to get this song, i dont have it
Through an exit? :l
double doors?
3Yes.
Emergency exit, maybe.
3Natleyn is correct
3And if you are outside, how do you get in?
I still like to go through windows or walls more...
Entrance.
3Correct again.
08,01ooooh
3What if there is only one door?
08,01now it makes sense
It is both entrance and exit.
3Exactly
08,01both the entrance and the exit at the same time lol
3And if I go through it, i am going through two doors.
Assuming you're not multidimensional, you technically only use it one way, though.
08,01how it is a mindfuck thouhg?
3Although I am going through one backwards
08,01it's just... clever mind puzzles?
I don't get the way of that being a mind fuck at all
In which case it acts as one or another....
3That was ontop of several other things
ah
3That was just the coup de grace
is that why she wants to murder Silvermane?
Tell me some more so I don't have to go back to the sadfic thread! :D
3No, that was SB, Fluttershy was mindfucked through opportunity
08,01Fluttershy wants to murder Silver because D_E has convinced her that Silver is cheating on her >>
3I remember what spawned it
hmmm
this is possibly true
but is hard to actually probe
*prove
also it's all about perspective
08,01Silver is a player -_-
3SB was asking me about how his mod application went
id imagine he is
heheh
3I told him that I could not disclose that
yeah he is
3He told me the conversation did not exist.
and it's funny to see when it blows up in his face
Hah.
3I then proceeded into some Shrodinger arguments about waveform
Lmao.
Schrodinger arguments.
3I argued that the conversation both existed and did not exist at the same time
His cat is dead
3But since I was seeing the conversation, at the time it did.
08,01Shroedinger's cat
Im watching Pony Polka again :D
08,01lawl
3And it went on from there...eventually he got so nutty that I coup de grace'ed him with that logic question
well I'm listening to 'People=Shit'
08,01love quantum physics
Revolver: MY CAT IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
ect ect
congratulations
08,01lol
Or maybe it isn't, or maybe it is, or maybe it isn't...~
3Really? I think he is alive.
that was also to Fluttershy`
go to alex s. dubstep on youtube and play party with pinkie
08,01I'm pretty sure he's dead
Denied_Existence: Nope! Never had a cat.
Or did I?
Maybe I didn't.
08,01Then again
did you?
08,01he's alive
08,01somehow
DId I have a cat? o_O
08,01in another dimension
well
At one point I did, but I think we gave him away.
I was speaking in this dimension
08,01I wonder if I can play mind games...
We're not allowed to have pets, but that one time was an exception...
but in an alternate dimension that is possible
We found him in the middle of the road, playing with a plastic bag ;__;
seeing as every decision branches off from each other into an alternate universe and keeps on going
meaning
3But what if you both had a cat, and did not have a cat? And only you saw the cat while all of your visitors thought you were crazy? Or vise versa?
there is an endless amount of alternate universes
3there are*
08,01Then you would be declared insane
3*trollface*
fuck grammar
Well, they interacted with the cat.
and spelling
Either I hallucinated them acting with the cat, which I'm fine with, or there was a cat.
So... either way I win?
Kitty <3

well I do
You're both missing your balls and in possession of them, both connected and not to your body :3
go to alex s. dubstep on youtube and play party with pinkie
3Kinky
no
I had an ex try and kill her self almost imediately after I broke up with her.
they are still on my body
08,01hehe
seriously
Dumori: Ooh. That sucks ;__;
yeah
08,01this conversation has totally gone down the toilet
Revolver: Alrighty.
that was fun
I would not talk about it if I didn't have them on my body still
then they tryed to knife me
08,01look what you started Denied_Existence!
/me shrugs
then she calmed down
This is still light for me~
me too
So whyyy don't I have a boyfriend... FUCK!
08,01What do you call the offspring of an elephant and a rhino?
Its sucks to be a powerful overlord that constantly gets called a PRINCESS.
Awwww
... nevermind.
hell, I once scared some guys off that were mugging me by punching myself in the nose and using the blood as war paint and saying "Oi! Lets do this shit!"

sounds badass actually
Revolver: Because you're badass, obviously.
Welcome, Scratch.
what can I say
/me hugs Scratch
I learned from the best
Insanity Wolf
3I will keep that in mind....
08,01Ooh looks like Fluttershy will soon be condemned to an insane asylum
It's Gary Coleman!
08,01at this rate anyway
(im still watching the stream)
08,01me too )
Trust me Fluttershy`, if I havent been yet, you have a long way to go
Revolver, same, though I haven't had as much experience using it as you.
08,01I'm MP, remember. Eh. Still using the Fluttershy` name true but ah well
meh
close enough for me
Time to do the time warp again
/me brohoofs Revolver
3Its just a step to the left!
/me brohoofs Natleyn
And a jump to the right!
We did it totally reversed
THEN WHAT DID WE DO
What does a backwards time-warp mean!?
08,01you... die in one dimension, but at the same time are still alive at the same time
backwards mind fuck.
Ah, I see
08,01still alive in the other dimension*
08,01so you are both alive and dead
meh
08,01and don't exist and do exist
it's true
08,01but you don't really exist
08,01you just think you do
not really mindfuck worthy
Ive had that happen to me before
It was interesting feeling
I've 'stared into the abyss' so to speak before
aaaah
08,01See, you're actually visible to everybody but yourself... or perhaps you are invisible to everybody else and only you can see yourself?
Shadenpony :D
Wee need to go to the reverse-verse, home of tac nayn, the sworn enemy of nyan cat!
I've never got a headache or anything from trying to comprehend the universe... but it does bounce back onto my mind, and I get kinda... not dizzy, really, more like I stop thinking for a few sseconds.
a reboot, so to speak.
08,01it's like trying to comprehend how we speak
Where would I be now if it wasn't for me being hospitalized for a month after getting the Swine Flu and having a sever asthmatic reaction...
init natleyn.os
08,01how a human mind can absorb so much informaiton
3If you die in one dimension, you die in all of them...
running.....
nope
08,01and then we can spout it all out
well
08,01how our mind pieces it together
08,01and how we arrange it and understand it
08,01basically we can just speak
08,01and we spout out words
08,01but our mind is putting them together
08,01somehow
Hello everypony :P
Welcome, SuperBrony64
/me huggles SuperBrony64
08,01SCHROEDINGER'S CAT
I'm trying to get ponies to mindfuck me.
3Hi SuperBrony, have you recovered from the mindfuck finally?
3Or are you a perma-thrall?
/me 8sticks a finger into Natleyn's ear. "You are now mindfucked."
Denied_Existence: Some bruises on the noggin' and a couple hundred thousand brain cells lost, but I'm recovering.
3Darn, well I can always re-thrall you if need be.
/me places both fingers in both of Fluttershy` s ears . DOUBLE mindfuck :p
It's actually quite painful :D
/me flinches away from Fluttershy`. "That's not mindfucked, that's just awkward!"
08,01AHHHH
Oh yeah, and to hell with the bot in this room >:(
activate ALL CAPS MODE
Smilin' at me :3
Reaaaaaaaaaal friendly ;D
Maybe I was gay? -shrugs-
Gay man on the train~
Everytime I use colors, I GET WARNED AND/OR KICKED :(
3;3
11,02 You mean like THIIIIIS?

/me hugs SuperBrony64
Yeah, that's what happened.
Welcome back!
your first fail
hehe
Welcome back Revolver
I feel like I'm about to get banned from the server :<
08,01SuperBrony64 how did you get kicked? >>
SuperBrony64, you're supposed to kick after the SECOND time
the first time serves a warning :p
Fluttershy`: Color avoidance doesn't apply to him
Fluttershy`: The bot doesn't have me listed as an exception...
^Better wording.
I'm tired ;3
I've been trying all day with warnings galore :P
Not going to bed because I'm not sad enough
That's why I got an instant kick
Me too, I think I'll go to bed
D'awww, woona
Go sleep LordCelestia :3
Woona?! WHERE??
/me hugs LordCelestia goodnight
SuperBrony64: Stream
08,01hehe
Night you too :P
Meh

My mom wants
The stream is just a playlist on loop right?

OH HEY ITS 3AM
Revolver, sleep well.
/me huggles Revolver
OH BOY 3AM *takes out a krabby patty and eats it*
08,01It's only almost 1
SuperBrony64: yes
08,01sheesh
But I only have to be up at 9 tommorow
I can get up whenever.
And it's only 2 here
I'm doing homework and blasting through cursors.
3Lol
what time is all the fun stuff tomorrow?
Actually
2pm I think.
3Dat Krabby Patty
alrighty
More like 7
im hungry now
Hmm…I'm afraid to try colors one more time...
hehe D_E got it
I hope that bot doesn't have an automatic ban function...
Probably won't go to bed though
Sunday Stream begins at 2pm EST
BUT NONE OF YOU KNOW THAT!!
Alright, it's time for me to go to bed now. Isn't EST wonderful -_-

I can kind of hear the audio to Art of the Dress after all the OP's finished
08,01I mean, is it illegal if it's the mod who writes it?
No...?
No, but I could do something very nasty about it :3
But if somepony doesn't like it and says so to other mods.

:D:D:D
I dont recall covincing her that Silver was cheating on her...just pointing out he did not have a good track record...
Fluttershy`: QUIET YOU! YOU'RE DEAD
If I killed her, she's not dead. Revenance is the *best* resurrection spell ever made.
08,01Her weak mind became convinced Denied_Existence
Anyway, Watership Down is the best movie ever!

CMON SADFIC THREAD
You're supposed to leave me feeling broken and sobbing

Tovler: CONGRATULATIONS!
hi guys
Those are difficult to catch :3
Hey JC_Denton
Greetings.
Hello Core :P
Actually it was a Dream World Abra.
So, now we're watching the comlete history of the Soviet Union arranged to the melody of Tetris?
lol JC_denton
complete*
lets go take down some NSF
lulz, I'm not even watching the stream :P
Dream World Abra is immune to Spikes, Poison, Burns, etc. Fuck yeah
/me hands JC a gep gun
Abra is a boss
So, you ponies ready for the awesome stream tomorrow?
It's THE LION KING
Fuck yeah
cool
pffft, i can go see that in 3d
/me needs to expand his vocabulary
(I kid.)
Tomorrow? Actually, it is morning right here now, so it'll be this evening for me.
still got it on VHS
Well, this one will NOT be in 3D for the record. I did confirm is :3
I think I'll check it out.
Coolbeanz Core!
Is it the Blu-Ray rip?
Does it really matter? :P
It will begin at 9 PM here.
You're not gonna get 1080p quality.
As much as we wish for that.
So the timing is more or less perfect for a movie night thing.
Glory to the Soviet Union
2 PM EST…whenever that is for you
Let this be a reminder: USE http://www.bronystate.net tomorrow.
If you are watching the stream right now, you're good. :P
If not, http://www.bronystate.net is the answer.
le oinque
this song gets stuck in my head 'i never asked for this"
Which song JC?
that Tetris one
a b or c
Yo, when is the Special Wicker Man event?
Wicker Man event?
Wicker Man was denied as a B movie because it was planned for something special.
Well, I don't know anything about its denial. But as for any special usage of it, I'm not sure.
Even if I did know, that's classified information :P
Just keep your eye on the newsletter if anything does show up about it.
Howdy Apokalipse
hello
Had to pop out for a minute
or several
That's cool, I forgive ya :P

Wanna know the golden rule?

Need to spread that out to everypony out there...
Super dont know cause no one knows when it will be showen =p
SHHHHH
They don't need to know that :P
but it makes you look silly, wich amuses me.
Your argument is invalid.
Man I am totally readying audacity for any potential mod singing tonight
I'd be Mod singing…but it's Sunday.
I don't sing on Sundays :P
So who's streaming?
Luna
But she's not here at the moment
Ah
So leave a message after the beep
Guess she's playing the playlist then
It's on autoplay
When it stops, it stops :P

Guess what guys
Cage is a vampire
got to love USB3
this video '"i never asked for this"
6.94GB of music to the stick in 6 minutes 37 seconds
24 MB/s transfer rate :P
I'm surprised no one made a meme out of that bar scene
are you a wizard?
I am Tim, the Enchanter...
you have a thumdrive that can use usb3?
Ee-yup
And an external 1tb hdd as well
what a waste of cash =p
Not really :P
i still got usb 1 :(
My old one is dying badly and I got the ports on my PC
hehe not the bees, reminds of the PONIES anthology
where they dubbed that part onto Celestia
the external is good it's what mine is. But a thumb drive seem pointless.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxhFd_vr7Rc
Thumb drive brings portability.
I could use dropbox/my own webspace/etc but that has one limitation
My upload bandwidth is insanely low
Compared to the one on the thumbdrive
hehehe that tanky thing puts a whole new meaning to Angry Birds
AWW WOW BIG BLUE!
still doesn't beat Pinkie Pie is Invincible
or freeezie
oh my, I did not think luna would put that one on here.
I showed it to her as a joke.
Diftraku: There's also the security aspect of depending on a cloud for file transfers.
Ee-yup
As in, you typically have no control over the security.
Looking back at what happened with LastPass then they noticed some odd network traffic
no I get that it's fast and secure but how often will you need to transfer the contents of the drive or be under a time crunch to do so?
They really freaked out because they spotted some odd bits moving around
And pretty much had the entire userbase reset their passwords and encryption keys to make sure all the encrypted bits on their server that might have been stolen were worthless
Better to have it and not need than need it and not have it.
And they were not even sure anything was stolen
They just spotted some odd traffic in their network
Paranoid? Yes
yeah in this case it sounds like a copout EspyLacopa
Heh, animated Ponygeist banner
It's awesome :P
indeed
I like this video way too much, must be cause it reminds me of niconico
Night all
Heh, BronyState has added me to their google+ circle
Wait... someponies actually use G+?
I signed up for it, because why not. I already use gmail.
Oh lawl
Just realized the new pony thread on MMO champion is at almost 7k posts
It was created 4 days ago
Ponies are slowly but surely taking over the intarwebs.
Just think where we'll be in a year.
That's an average of 72.7 posts an hour
0.02 posts every second
there is nothing else i'd rather have take over the internet tbh
EqD almost 50M page views
lawl
I did some math
the last 10M on eqd have gone super fast
The old thread averaged at 66.5 posts per hour
We're now going about 6.2 posts an hour faster with this pace
And the old thread was live for ~150 days
witch thread?
So, the new thread should be at 261720 posts in same time if we keep the pace
http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/987084-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic-(part-2)
Old thread: http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/893666-My-Little-Pony-Friendship-is-Magic!
wat, 1001 pages
no

Hello.
Hey
http://bronies.memebase.com/2011/10/02/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-metal-bronies/
i'm a metal brony
mop kinda sucks though
yeah
I'm a metal brony too
Master of Puppets?
Main reason why I posted it
I wonder what metal bands would become bronies....
i think any europower band
I think it would be interesting to see Slipknot become bronies
i think metal mario would be a brony
I wonder about Cataract
david crowder aint metal but i could see him being a brony easily
FFDP as bronies
Is this playlist STILL going on? Or is somebody streaming currently?
Cant say
I'm on my iPod
the leetstreet boys probably already are bronies
Im listening to skrillex at 10:42 AM.
Its on about 100 volume. My parents can sleep later.
yes the playlist is still going on
its in the main theatre...
Ewes
Workload
but i dont know who is streaming...
Damn you iPod!!!!
Ewwwww Skrillex
Oh well. I cant handle not listening to them.
I cant handle not listening to Chimaira, Slipknot, Etc
True.
I dont really listen to chimaira, But i understand where your going.
CONFOUND THEM!
im guessing so
slowed down mlp theme o_o...
Sounds bad.
What we always need is a techno remix or dubstep...There choice.
Sort of like now.
I'm
Just going to keep listening to Fear Factory
WoW dwarf? Damn, To think i quit it years ago.

In equestria, Born and raised
at ponyville where i spent most of my days
To the MOON!
*Duck Tales moon theme plays)
We all have learned something
Jackie Chan = best chan
Nope
Down to simple beeps and meeps...They can be the best songs.
Go go Jackie.
Go Go power rangers.
*Talking about the old one, Not the shitty new one
mighty morphin' power rangers!
I still have a power rangers fighting game on my SNES
lol you're streaming already?
never watched power rangers as i thought it looked shit
I never watched it much
the original power rangers is MY CHILDHOOD
its only random vids / pmv's
/me had power rangers game on game gear.
I tried watching it recently
but it turned out to be terrible
so this is a long ass prestream
...I think I still have it.
definite nostalgia there
* EspyLacopa had power rangers game on game gear.
:O
The new Power Rangers are shit.
Nostalgia = earlier today
I had a power rangers game on the game gear
Hmmmmm.
all thanks to luna xD
Lol this video?
I HATE PEARS
/me checks ye olde game gear case
you selected a ranger
and then fought through a series of enemies
and you got zords and stuff
I was awful at it
I HATE PEZ! I ABSOLUTELY HATE PEZ!
really really bad
:|
But i love pz
*pez
Oh shit.
so much dr whooves
This video played at like 12:00 pm
This shit be repeating.
Good lord I had forgotten how huge the game gear was.
lol
and how quickly it ran out of batteries
Ah, the game I have is based on the Power Rangers movie.
4 sonic games. . .1, 2, triple trouble, chaos
speaking of games
THE GAME
CELESTIA DAMN IT SHAD!
/me wonders if it still works
SUDDEN FAT GINGER
lol
I keep thinking of runescape when it was the shit.
/me gets a nostalgic feel
Oh god...2007 was fucking awesome.
So was 2008-2009
maplestory used to be the shit too
Yup.
until they updated and changed the shit out of everything
then i quit
Shad, Thats exactly what happened to dear old runescape.
It went through 3 changes
But one change was actually good.
mfw i had this playing while playing Halo Reach and completely raped asses
LOL "Why does liking anime and video games﻿ make someone "socially dysfunctional?" Believe it or not, we've had fans get engaged / married to our songs, so they definitely aren't "virgins" and "losers." Or are you just insecure about your own sexuality?" - leetstreet boys
I prefer the Dash video for the Hercules song, "You can do the Distance"
I just miss runescape.
Streamlag anyone?
nope.
Yup.
i had some earlier
Yeah.
but it went away before the other video started
going to refresh
oh.. didn't realize there was a stream going on
/me logs into runescape in the first time in 2 years
I spent about 11 months getting to level 100 in maplestory, to later find out I could get to level 100 in a month
what a waste
Feels bad man
so basically they fucked over all the beta players
and said hey noobs, you can level easy
I still havent got to level 90 in RS
Or got a masters cape
Feels bad
Never got into Maplestory.
I played maplestory until i got to level 39
early maplestory was the shit
I lost interest after that
True
after big bang just no
Has anybody played runescape here through 2007-2009?
I sure did.
i quite runescape cause the horrible people who play it.. not that the game was really that bas itself
quit*
bad* argh
FLUTTERSHYS
o:
they either didn't talk to you when you were clearly talking to them or they were scammers or just punks
maplestory players got a lot worse now
everyone sits afk saying FAME UP
nobody interacts
it was kinda the same way when i played
I really wonder what made them decide to make such huge changes when the game was doing amazing
maplestory was a pretty good game for being free though.. i mean these easy exp updates are just a terrible punch to the face of all your faithful fans.. but the game WAS good i figured
just not great like i cared for
I FOUND NON OF THESE APPS
I DISAPPOINT
hub, I AM DISSAPOINT
someone made a old spice big mac commercial
mfw
always reminded of Command and Conquer from this
MFW I wake up to nukes being dropped in Ponyville
THE TOWN IS EXPLODING
I NEED TO GRAB MY DOORMAT
WUT
This song
Generosity online
LOLLUNA
THIS IS REALLY WHAT HAPPENED
nope
what luna did for 1000 years
This song reminds me of Explosions in the Sky so much
SAY WUT
Time to mute the stream
That song makes Allis mad
but it fits
^-^
I don't think of Rarity as a disgusting, self-serving whore
suddenly skipping
stream's at 2 pm EST right?
yes
I'll be afk till then
i cleared my weekend for this event,
hey Veewave
What are we watching today?
Hi

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Replica_catapult.jpg/300px-Replica_catapult.jpg like this but smaller
Trebuchet?
No no no
I liked the rubber band gun I made in cub scouts.
no that' s a regular catapault
trebuchets look like this http://www.gifterotica.com/gifts/trebuchet.gif
which one is better
trebuchet = counterweight. catapault = spring (more or less)
lol, Emmet_Brown.
07,01LOL
heya Veewave
Hi
Luna: D'aw!
Luna, dats cute :3
/me puts a hoof in ctrlx's mouth
Good pic to wake up to.
Thats adorable
\:x/
07,01I know :D
:D
I wonder what her official personality will be
^
This
I hope she's very likable
^ yup
Well
Knowing the other characters
There's no way she won't be likable
Firefly is best pony
But if she isn't we'll still love and tolerate the crap out of her.
I need to make a MLP theme for my WoW client
I already have a Holo one
My catapult shoots a ball bearing 5 metres :D
Firefly is Lauren Faust favourite pony
and the base for Rainbow Dash
so she is best Pony
Orly?
YA RLY!
Everypony is best pony
Fine.
Luna is best pony
AND best mod
AND best streamer
<3 Luna
lol
/me praises Luna at his Luna-shrine
FLASCHEN
ITS HER
!!!1
Which is interesting because I've never, never liked all characters in a show
YAY~!
i don't like snails and snips
lol, I only hate owlowlicious
and owlicious would've been okay without the "who?" puns
he is jsut there to make a spike-heavy episode
which is fine
brb walking the dog
Well, main characters at least
http://www.hjo3.net/orly/gal1/orly_lemmony.jpg <-- o rly?
Remember to stab Silvermane when he enters chat everypony.
why??
By orders of Fluttershy'
hmmm
It's also possible that you were dumped here because someone tried to link you directly to an image I'm hosting. Tell them to link to a page or directory instead. If you really want to see the item, copy the URL in your address bar and paste it into a new browser window
not really up for murder today
She went crazy last night
what happened?
Oh, right. Can't forget that.
oh yeah i remember now, still not going to stab...
She logged on and started saying to kill Silvermane with knoves
*knives

i wouldve never thought they would mention it
ok i have a question: has there been somehing NOT ponified yet? cos i think all has been covered already
also hope you dont mind a completely random note but to those that like anime: WATCH HUNTER X HUNTER REBOOT!
I'm sure most of Adult swim is Bronies
Now I see the funny side
Now I'm always smiling
Oh yeah, HunterxHunter(2011)
Is the stream up? i seem to be unable to connect to it.
07,01in a bit
DAMNIT
Im not gonna be able to watch the stream. My friend's coming over :(
07,01watch together :)
Erm, hes not a brony. Nor does he know that I am a brony.
07,01hahaha
07,01time to come out of the closet!
Nor will I tell him anytime soon
its easy, just say that your a brony and if he has any problems with it, he can leave anytime he wants
well convert hio to the herd; everpony is better off becoming a brony
07,01indeed
07,01I even converted my bf :)
OF ANYTHING, I'll hypathetically ask my dad if he would have a problem with watching a kids show that thousands of other people happen to enjoy too
Then laugh about it if he said "THATS GAY SON"
if i said that to my dad, well, i hardly ever see him so i dont care what he thinks
Also, being in high school at the time, letting people find out that (Name withheld) watches My Little Pony would make my life a living hell...
My parents don't give a shit.
2,14 phffff
lololllo i dun give a fuck what others think
/me pulls out mlp toys "lolwut?"
ive told pretty much everyone i know that i <3 my little pony
I dont care what people think either, but, eh, I'm an easy target for getting the shit teased out of me.
But other than that I usually have a fuck the world attitude.
not a single one of my friends gets why i like it though...
Kdude: maybe they have to watch it to understand
:D
^i know that feel
thats what i told 'em but as if they're gonna watch it just cause i said it's cool
I'm bacl

I like the Krayt Call
not nostalgiac enough but it's still cool
Lions live for ten to fourteen years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than twenty years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than ten years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity
Whoopi Goldberg was one of the best parts of this movie.
mfw I chose to watch lion king with bronies reather than play LoL
I was like
OMG LOOK AT TEH TIME
2PM

Lag free for me! *is a happy kitteh*
Now I feel guilty for making Euro lose their good stream.
What I don't get is why was it lagging today when I've never had lag before
same here Tovler
07,01Owncast is prolly in europe...
07,01veemi = us...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEKnHfDkmis

There appears to be quite some lag in Europe.
hmmm
sir cul lie
i was here on friday and it worked perfectly for me... i dunno why im lagging now
07,01neither do I ... owncast worked fine for me
/me is still from eu and is still getting no lag at all
07,01veemi is horrible...
^
08,01I mean, when you saw me streaming via livestream is was pretty good wasn' tit?
/me sobs
08,01it*
awww, poor Luna
Yeah I was here friday and yesterday and I had no problem yet today it was bad
it was yeah :/
/me pats Luna on the back.
and why did we restart?
13I prefer Owncast... but thr lag. x.x
I say go back...
Yes the stream worked great last night.
yeah, go back
but whatevs
i'm still confused as to why you don't use justintv
07,01justintv is annoying ads
adblock
^
LOL
08,01livestream!
adblock
adblock
07,01adblock does not skip it
08,01try it?
ok got stream but it's even worse then before
badlock
07,01at least not abp
06Ustream/Livestream? D:
livesttream is reaaal bad
yes it does for me D:
ABP=shit
ustream is bareable but livestream is like stoneage
its a routing issue, sunday is a high traffic day
yeah this is unwatchable D:
Luna adblock doesn't work with video on chrome
on firefox etc it does
something must be done here
something is rotten in the state of intermark
07,01oh well...we'll be testing our own server tonight...
13Is that a challenge? Reminds me of a certain MLP video...
yes it does MantisToboggan
I blame sunday sports for the lag
adblock does block video ads on chrome Mantis
Bjornfot nope.avi
yes, you're doing it wrong
it's why I never have to deal with Youtube ads
2,14 lol, and in hercules, he did :P
wow Zazu is creul
could be that crono_flash. considering we never have problems on friday
http://chromeadblock.com/
07,01I normally stream on friday...
2 in my family,but we managed to eat him
13Dat blue plot
that makes sense actually
Sounded like tha to me
Val: I see wat u did thar
Yeah that's what I thought so what is this madness?
you normally stream pure awesome, Luna :D
Whenever he gets dirty, you can take him out and beat him
07,01so US stream is fine now?
Eeyup
eeeyup
yes
inb4 save game point
13Fine here Woona
no it actually isn't
US stream is fine.

yes
im not getting lag
07,01geez...
yep
and im UK...
When ever I'm on a stream site on sunday, it's usually nothing but sports
unfortunately
its getting better
Hey, am I imagining things or is it not lagging anymore?
I'm also not getting lag and am from eu... you know. Still
DAD.

/me prays to the internet gods to help out the EU guys.
daddaddadadadadadadadadadad
I'll just go watch it on video

No lag
06):

07,01it's improving here... *knocks on table*
now it's getting better

/me stopped watching it
Working fine in the states.
Luna im not getting any lag what so ever
13I dont think we can have it perfect for everyone... at least not right now.
2,14 so now here's the question...if Mufasa and scar are the only males...who the hell are all these ladies that aren't Sarabi? where did they come from?
Mom. Mom. Mom. mommy. mommy. Mama. mama. Mum. mum. mum. mummy mummy. mom.
I'm US and I'm not lagging

07,01yay
Still getting intense lag.
2,14 so then I guess that means Nala is Simba's half-sister :P
I believe
Yes
Ok. Perhaps it would be best if there is no further messing with the video.
WINCEST
oh god
she either came from mufasa or scar
lol
Haven't payed the hornbills pfft
MOOOOOOORNING REPOOOOOOOOORT
val, why did you ruin my childhood D:

All lionesses are black?
Btw, how was Avatar (airbender) yesterday?
I'm totally opening up audacity every time we have modtalk now
Luna switched streams
they're 'zecora' tovler
deliopen: terrible, obviously
Good thing I did not see it
10,2Dat water hole
deliopen: Please don't remind me
It was quite enjoyable. Because it was horrible.
XD
and I didnt even watch it
Apokalipse, herdmind. I decided that weeks ago XD
dohohoh, water hole
well it is africa Tovler
/me is watching pictures again
that movie is a real b movie
kick count: 9001?
inb4 music
hearing it though?
Nala:"oh~~~!"
inb4 Second best song.
When fluttershy started giggling like crazy I thought that it was worth recording
aww this is my second favourite song D:
or is it third?
foreshadowing
bahahaaha
EQD!
D'awwww

13Dred pirate Woona!
/me runs to check EqD

JTT is 30?
Is the stream going? (I am on bronystate.net)
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=cookiesonsundaynight
deliopen
get it? Mane effect?
This level was a pain in the ass on the Sega Genesis game. x.x
http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=cookiesonsundaynight deliopen
...
is watching pictures, but atleast I can hear it right
I saw a video called simba and nala go to whitecastle which made this song just hilarious
oh god, flashbacks to the gameboy game
Yes
is it working now, at cookies?
hmm, by my estimations, if you guys used amazon cloudfront as a cdn, it'd cost you about $130 to serve an hour of 1mpbs video to 2000 users
This level was a pain on the sega
lol
dont know if I ever played it
was I the only one that didn't play the game?
This lag is agonising.
CopperCogs: I know. The timing needed was horrible.
So the stream isn't working on the site?
fluttercry nope
hang in there stonegaze
so did anyone see this in 3d?
it'd probably be far more reliable and faaar less laggy than this
I messed this level's face up on the sega
but it wouldn't be free
/me didn't see the 3-D version.
Stonegaze, can you hear it?
Yes you did TrickQuestion we played this game all the time
's cool Silverscreen.
Nah, can't stand 3D movies.
You might not remember it though
when? I dont remember
I want to see the Stage version of this, though.
Veewave: on the pc version, if you were paused it and turned turbo off (on a 486) it'd crasht the game
that woudl be awesome
When we were little duh
I can't bare 3D movies either
Ricks?
or was it at home?
what was the game name? the complete name?
I feel the need to dl it right now
the glasses are annoying :/
3d gives me headaches
The Lion King
TrickQuestion, The audio work but the viedo lags quite a lot. It lags especailly when I turn on the chat.
07,01me too
No at home
same fluttercry
dat rape
I can't do 3d movies, i ware glasses
We had a Sega if you remember
huh, dont remember it at all
I thought the 3D movie was pretty amazing
Oh well, I'm an hour late due to an Eastern > Western time miscalculation :P
you can put the 3d glasses over normal ones, btw
/me STILL has a Sega Genesis
derp.
an elephant rave?
I wear 3D glasses over my regular glasses :p
Hey is it true that this movie took some ideas from kimba?
the lag gives me head aches
3D effects were nice on 2D hand-drawn animation.
I remember the sega, I remember sonic and dr eggman's goo machine, and pitfall
Silverscreen: Still have a SNES :3
just dont remember this
/me still has SNES
yeah, there was a movie called "kimba the white lion"
inb4 we watch Kimba the White Lion for BMN
I have my old SNES here but ti doesn't work properly.
/me hates his connection
but its basically the plot of hamlet
/me brohoofs fluttercry
>Dr Eggman's goo machine
/me has his NES Zapper but not his NES.
Really?
Discord: Yes, but Kimba took the idea from african legends and fairy tales, so it's not exactly original either.
/me still has a Sega Mastersystem
Mr Banana Beak
I have my SNES and some old Atari systems
i prefer the name Dr. Robotnik
so the new 3d glasses fit over glasses?
Mr. Banana Beak!
/me dad sold his NES by "accident"
dont know what to do for it Stonegaze, but on the other one us was lagging sound a video
/me has Genesis, SNES, and NES
And a master system with no cables
oh wait, it was Dr. Robotnik wadd'nt it?
Go Ed!

Really Trick it was Dr. Robotnick's Mean Bean Machine
whatever, you knew what I meant
oh noes!
/me 's dad sold his original pokemon card collection worth £1200
Mean Bean Machine was fun. Reminded me of Dr. Mario.

Hi guys!
Jet Set Radio was pretty awesome :p
lag is making me sad....
I miss the 90s to 2000s. those were the golden days of consoles
The Dreamcast system itself was ahead of its time, but it was given so few GOOD games.
VioletVanilla: Do you have Jojo's Bizarre Adventure? :0
07,01I'll just re-stream the entire thing
06Jet Set Radio is the game I have been playin
07,01in the post show

ValtheJean, what frustrations did you have in Civ4?
Veewave Is still hanging out in the 4th dementional bush outside of Luna's house?
06inb4 links Val
06XD
If you say so.
my frustration for Civ5 was my computer can't handle it
2,14 oh u violet :P
Combustiblelemons2 :(
D:
my freustration for civ 5 is it liked to crash at 75 citys
No terraforming is bad.
06Por que?
.....
oh dear sumica
and the multy was rushed
you were the one who joined me right Veewave?
/me hasn't eaten today.
hey guys, wanna know something interesting?
2,14 that's one reason I like Civ3 so much, having so many cities wasn't a massive drain on your computer
i'm vpn'd into my EC2 instance from the UK, and it's pretty much eliminated my lag
herospirit: neither have I. woke up a few hours ago
you know your a pro torrenter whn you are uppting twice as fast as your downspeed is
2,14 unless you played that WW2 Global map, that thing was a beast...but totally worth it
:\
herospirit: GET SOME FOOD, SON
but civ 5 is fun when you have giant mech's wandering the earth
ValtheJean, yeah but you couldn't do anything with that many cities because of the corruption.
/me shares his three cheese pizza with herospirit
13Now you're making me want to play it again...
eeyup
2,14 phfff, that's why you build the forbidden palace
3 times now...
x3
/me just went to the Cloetta factory and baught a bunch of candy
/me should reheat his leftover pizzas...
2,14 corruption is easy to overcome
Forbidden Palace only helps so much.
Test
*bought
wish i had that 'problem' XD
2,14 you just have to be willing to pay for it
/me fixes chicken wings.
Anyone who was here last night, I apologize for my SUPAR ANGST
That's why i only play on small maps.
/me huugs herospirit
07,01alright here we go
ALL IS FORGIVEN
06~yay~
2,14 besides, my outlying territories are just meat shields for invasions anyway
herospirit: Good nights sleep has destroyed that sad feeling I got from that fic btw. I have officialy gotten over it and will never be made emo by it again. sleep deprivation aparently makes me a little emotional... :/
07,01Ghosties movie-choice if i'm not mistaken
13Oh no, sad movie inc
My body is ready.
/me hugs Revolver
/me can't have pizza due to all the videogames coming out.

04Yes
REPENT HEROSPIRIT, REPENT!
04My film choice is up next
Tovler: Money issues?
my conversation will not be as intense
/me slaps Veewave around a bit
13Ghosties makes Octavia cry :(
I see a wowhead icon
/me shares his pizza with Tovler
x3
ValtheJean, an enemy state declares war on you. How long do you hold a grudge?
Ghosties stoped having etherial sex to watch this next movie.

Veewave already blew your cover to me
/me hugs Octavia
I'm hoping to have 4 times it soon
Anyways. I think I'm probably going to be crashing sick and tired today or tomorrow.
my only problem for age of mythology was creating your own levels was almost impossible

I hate having 20+ engineers and every round: 1 step out of city, 1 step into city, ....
I always get depression and angst when I'm going to be getting sick soon. Remembered that last night before I went to bed. So, yar. I'm waiting for the sick to happen.
sucks
I'm gonna ignore the chat during this movie. It's going to be tough.
one thing I miss in civ 5 the most is the culture bomb.
same stonegaze
I'd have 40 down 10 up
07,01and here we go
when I switch
Ah, looks like I'm back just in time!
Let's-a-go!

I'd love chocolate rain to actually happen
That's the move with the tree?
/me steps forward to clamp the chains on Pegacorn's limbs
Oh this movie. It's so bizarre to see Robin Williams in a dramatic role.
It's pretty good.
I saw him do a documentry once. Harrest man I have ever seen.

04Robin Williams can be a really good dramatic actor
My magic's already holding him perfectly still...
That's novel.
13I'm probably not going to talk much during this movie, going to be too busy watching it. lol

Trivia: Robin Williams's name can anagram into I Warm Billions
this movie lacks ponies....
/me agrees with Sumica
/me closes the metal bonds over Pegacorn's fetlocks carefully, trying not to pinch him
Everything is perfect in the beginning of the movie. You know what that means.
I'm finding it hard to watch the movie and the chat.
Word to the wise: If you EVER have a romantic date that ends watching a sunset, somebody's getting cancer.
what does that have to do with anything Purple`Prose...?
Look, I wouldn't want to have to remind you of my vastly superior network again Alex.
They all going to DIE!

04What Dreams May Come
For some reason, I always have a hard time crying at non-animated movies or TV shows.
SO INTENSE
/me hopes that his family friend who's passing on will have a hapy afterlife like this.
dunno why.
/me cried because of the double rainbow.
ggasdfa sdfasdg
/me cries too

Most. Awesome. Pony. Ever.
06Double rainbow
/me hopes so too for ThePretender
06All the way
06Across the sky. . .
oh my god!
/me rears up to set some chain into the anchors over Pegacorn's head
That is great.
06ThePretender I hope so too. .
what does this mean?
So instead of doing a movie about the life of the kids we fastford it during the credits then flashback to it through the rest of the movie?
ggasdfa sdfasdg
As a long-standing Robotnik fan, how could I not love this? :P
06^ Eyyup
drinking tea (pinky extended) and watching What Dreams May Come. And people call Bronies imature.
We are on a boat.
"To sleep, perchance to dream, ay there's the rub. For in this sleep of death what dreams may come."
*headdesk*

It's like it's Shakespeare night on here
I'd laugh if he kissed her then she dropped dead.
I think I should like to see a movie Dari would make.
That'd be hilarious.
04Didn't Lion King borrow its thematic elements straight from Hamlet, or something?
LOL, Dari XD
dari has the best movie ideas
Then he touched her down and made her come in a church.
2,14 Ghosties: eeyup

I like her writing style.
We can begin playing now!
Kdude well, that's why you're not in this movie.

A hug every five minutes is within our capabilities, I'd say.
No, I think I can manage,but thanks anyway.

or lash's option works too :P
yeah but if i was, the film would be way better
YOURE DEAD GUY

Fresh Prince

Rainbow_derp: beat you to it!
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Now this is a story, all about how, my life got twist turned upside down

06,15I'm also a big fan of not dying, really.
04I like that line, Val
i wish heaven had respawn points instead
@RAWRity I second that
My heaven would be an all-you-can-eat-steak-house with internet.
"I think, therefore I exist."
06inb4 Schrödinger's Dari

Im back everyone :D
I'd rather die than make others suffer for the prolongment of my life
Veni Vedi Vici
[ger]Brony1: nice
06Your brain is meat

I was neutral about dying until ponies. Now I can't miss life.
LOL RELIGIOUS PROPAGANDA SHIT
There is no spoon in the house.

Wouldn't heaven get kinda... oh idk... boring after a while?
04Yes it is, Luna

Did I give you an existinential crisis the_si?
Where's all the etherial sex?

Unless you could spawn zombies.
I can do that ^_^
And shotguns.
deliopen you would just make it NOT boring.
I hope equestria is heaven, that would be awesome!
/me has lost interest in this movie and is watching other stuff
Purple square :3

Oh hai, purple square!
0648 virgin meringue~

yep
If this movie even touches roadhouse I will KIILL YOU.
SUPER FAST DRAW GO!

Shadizzle: NO!
04Moar cowbell?
I would do that, Celestia. Except I would fit my nick.

I like the Lost version of the afterlife. A big waiting room with your friends. And when everyone is ready, you all move on.
That girl is becomming a RBD, when she is older.

Darnit, had to do something, who is she?
First day in Hogwarts?
WHERE'S JESUS

Flying virgins are harder to catch. :(

It's filled with kids. Who the fuck fills Heaven with KIDS?
They're both in her world now.
Dual controls.
deliopen she's another "Expert" of heaven

Replayed?
yep, LordCelestia
No?
thats how people walk in heaven?

She must go back in time and destry the inventer of the car.
reincarnation? really?
Does this mean that all religions are true?
Wait...reincarnation? This movie just switched mythos on me
06inb4 reincarnation XD
and some people say gays are going to hell
lalalal
lawl
reincarnation. TAKE THAT, Abrahamic religions!
I guess it IS true.
and my childrens children?
Mix all the religions...?
Reincarnation is what I believe in
2,14 it's not so much switching as it is a giant hybrid of everything
06Rawrity, nope. In HER heaven, Reincarnation is what she believes in.
Mix ALL the religions!
If you mixed all religions
If only this movie was at least 1500 years old.
your mind would literally be fucked
04Pretty much, it's a hybrid of every religion
Damn you fast, EqD
that doesn't make sense. all of those people are from their own heavens.
06IT was the trucker's fault.
so yeah, it's a mix.
It's utterly sad and pathetic that some people really believe in "heaven".
is that his... nope
Ghosties: I see no Pastafarian in this.
We'll call it Robin Williamism
A trucker? I thought it was Kurt Angle/Matt Hardy.
here let me chear you up here are some kids that remind you of yourse
much like Ba'hai (take the good and leave the bad)
lol
bjornfot hey, let's not go there.
Where's the flying spaghetti monster?

06,15So basically everyone cries and is miserable in heaven?
Dari that chat gave me a boner
07,01indeed

AND THE EVERYPONY CAME
Gah, why you gotta kick? I miss the messages people send then. :/
No need to watch us, nope!
heaven isn't heaven without the people you love
'Nothing out of the ordinary' is pretty accurate, actually...
06I know it is the same for me Luna . .
inb4 she dies.
moral of the film
KILL YOSELF
2,14 combustible: what about for misanthropes? :P
It is for me Combustiblelemons2
are we halfway through the mvie, Luna?
I missed about 2/3 messges. :|

Suicide is silly.

I like to believe it's SCIENCE
screw your lemons! i dont need lemons!
/me sips soda
13Bjornfot, oh u :P
Bubububu baby you just aint seen nothing yet
Hold God at gunpoint. It worked for Stan Smith.
It's a trap!
did this movie just turn in to LOTR?
MFW science is about 100% made up and guesswork. :P
10,2No need for a religious debate. Take this movie for what it is ;)
oooh the river styx
Science is not a belief, it's fact
2,14 dari....
I believe the afterlife is a game of Dodge Ball, where I can do the matrix leanback whenever I want
srsly, anyone claiming anything SCIENCE hasn't proven is just stupid
04Indeed. Please guys, let's just enjoy the film
inb4religious war
I'm not religious, but to call people stupid just for their beliefs seems small-minded to me.
3Sorry, I am a man of science. Understand god is not my job.
It's like a cross between Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings
greek death theory time!
mfw dari is using some bizarre definition of 'made-up'
MFW CHAT HAS NOW TURNED INTO A FLAME WAR
What Denied_Existence said.
i never said people are stupid, just their beliefs
2,14 ENOUGH
SuperBrony64: Exactly!
anyone claiming science claims things they think cause they think it is stupid
06,15But any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable magic, and magic is friendship, and friendship is ponies...... so science is indistinguishable from ponies, I guess.
lolwut^^
Stop.
who said what now?
Movie now, beliefs later.
Styx?
07,01but before the pony eps start...
Hammer time
induringflamewar
13I figured we'd get a little religious debate because of this movie. :P
07,01I have something Unique to share with everypony
I could go for some circular glasses.
Ia ia...
o.O
I see religion like this: you can take the red pill or the blue pill...
BRB
there is no "debate" in religion
10,2No need for more religious comments guys.
C'thulu
04It doesn't help when Bjornfot and dar are exacerbating things
you know the rest.
F'tagn
I have a pair of circular shades. They're awesome

now i'm uber curious
love and tolerate everyone's religion
Quite so.

/me sips wine
no
Bjornfot: A lot of science hasn't been proven.
13Well, lets not egg it on by speakiong of it then SB :P
I thought Dari was remaining a nuetral party?
07,01please stop the color spam
Shadizzle: there you go
Hey listen hey hey listen hey hey listen. Let's NOT go down this road
07,01it's getting annoying
Phsyics for example is a lot of 'WTF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS'
what Luna said
I agree with Luna
Guys. Listen. This movie is dealing with the metaphysical, not religion or science. It's fantasy for the sake of telling a story. Stop going into shit like this.
08,01color spam?
Let's have a good old fashioned furry war.
08,01are you taking about what Dari's doing?
oki now I can see what SuperBrony64 is saying.
yes
......
07,01yep
disregard chat, watch movie
i tolerate religious people
but not religions
they just cause evil
dari, implying there is no such thing as a stupid belief?
10,2Bjornfot: Move away from the topic. Just watch the movie.
/me is off to get dressed and find food
/me doesn't think Dari realises that he's undermining his argument with his terrible color choice
2,14 okay that's where I draw the line. This little flamewar has gone on long enough. If people keep going on about this, I'm going to start kicking
08,01oh. yeah. Dari stop being a color troll.
04Bjornfot, enough
grab my arm. ADVENTURE!
04I will ban you

Hell is like an onion, though. It's got layers.

Trollestia how?
07,01that's why we have themed rooms
Yo. :)
So, this is cool and all, but it keeps reminding me that they're actually making another Percy Jackson movie. FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU
Ghehe.
06Hell is a lot like the original Super Mario Bros. 1 Life. No saves. World 7. Bowser's Castle.
06GO.
11,12>_>
CloudRunner: What client are you using?
/me waves at kirz

HE SAID F*** He's a bad man
Oh I know.
What's the difference between "The Divine Comedy" and "Dante's Inferno," btw?
I was there for the two season 2 premieres, remember? :P
You're doomed to his trollan, then.
10,2Hell is the Koopa shell launched between two pipes in Super Mario Bros.
I went mental.
deliopen, Inferno is part one of three.
07,01I hate the episode gap...
I like how the girls Coffen is more rounded =p

The Divene Comedy also has Purgatory and Heaven

dot like this movie, why not try zoidberg?
"LIFE? I'm DEAD!"

It's not a troll post

That the worst Ahnold ever and I've seen 2012
ummm...now the guy is making his own clopfic...
You guys haven't heard his other stuff?

Welcome back again, Octavia :3
Well you can't really make comments as you did and not expect to offend people Bjornfot.

THE ICE MEN COMETH

So don't be surprised if people are angry with you.
SYMBOLISM

/me needs to write a sock-clopfic right noaw!
SYMBOLISM EVERYWHERE
06EVERYPONY CHIIILLLLL~
yes.
That guy's voice...makes me want to play Skyrim. More. Now I can't stop thinking about it. :[
but i AM surprised that a mod called me an asshole
PMing insults is a whole new line there.
sock... clopfic...?
Ogod, thanks a lot leadhoof :P
Mr. Freeze did an excellent Ahnold in B&R. It sounded just like him.
kind of
im on hoodies..
lawl
06,15sea ponies in socks, that needs to be an art meme.
Sopfics
I'm not.
GO
yes
celestia and the magic door...
robotpinkie OH GOD NO
You were being an asshole.
Ghosties tells it like it is.
I can't help it! D:
He's blunt.
He always has been.
PSYCHIATRY
ponies with flank-warmers.... okay this guy has lost it
This is true :/
WHAT A TWEEST

Secret door fun

HE'S MICHAEL JACKSON?
(sorry :P)
HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ponies...with flank warmers
lol
and the white girl is Asian
Dis movie is mostly confusing.
*facehoof*
Uncle Ruckus is so jelly
anyne know where he lives so i can kill him?
I forgot about that part....
ASians are hawt ^
Discord in a maid outfit? I am not going to google that.
You know, that'd be immensely painful, compared to an ordinary facepalm.
Oh lordy
well, i guess
wait that was his daughter?
but i also just said it as it was
that first video.. is pretty sick
Hey guys I have that one friend here with me who actually knows I like ponies :p
[ger]brony1 that is a good decision
depends on if there's a horseshoe involved
only if i was twilight...all the others manage not to hurt themselves with such actions
or socks
luna has all the socks
08,01I MADE IT
LordCelestia nice :3 say hi to him/her for me!
Well, the only reason it hurt Twilight is because she poked herself in the eye.
Well you were warned to stop
You said things even though you knew they'd provoke people.
08,01wahaha
He says Hi too
so luna, are these reastreaming at 11:56 as violet said, or after this?
exactly...close eye first THEN facehoof
and pinkie is made of rubber and cotton candy, so it wouldn't hurt her
I'm a terrible, terrible person
(hes is my only real life friend who somewhat likes ponies too
lol
I just showed my Bronyism to my friends in a big way. I showed them my NaPoWriMo fanfic.
so what happens if you throw water on her? does she partially melt/
eeeyup
why am i watching the EQD post....
"so's most of the house mr. Williams. Do pay attention"
but, free spech, you know?
06,15Well, the sets and CG in this movie are pretty good at least.....
I suspect the outer shell is the rubber Alex.
06True RobotPinkie~
the hair is clearly cotton candy
I like how he flied.
And the music, too
o nvm
3....
No. This is the internet
anypony want the discoard maid outfit pm me
I gotta say the cg is really well done
TRIPPY MOVIE IS TRIPPY D:
07,01yep
You can't just apply that here
Well if you tell Ghosties that, he might agree with you, he's very big on the whole 'free speech' thing.
06SCARED ME
just gets less bouncy with water
For me, there is no 'free speech' here.
3What the hell was that about?
so where are we at, Luna?
it only gets wet with chocolate rain
Whys he callin his wife his neighbor??? What did I mkiss?
08,01huh?
what happend to the sad though?
/me already has the picture

we're near the end.
pinkie can never be less bouncy
06After this thehated :#
06:3 *
this is about to get wierd
3*Points upwards* That stuff....
You can't say things that break rules here, that's how I feel.
lordcelestia She doesn't know she's dead
06I was quoting what time it was currently
she thinks she's still alive, and he's a stranger.
different time zones
08,01Oh. SuperBrony64 isn't authorized to be in here yet.
But doesnt she recognize her own husband???
08,01I think he just got banned.
its only 6 here
She's insane, mostly.
no, she doesn't remember her family at all
she's on cocaine
I guess not.
Exactly. You can't go saying things somewhere if the mods don't want you to
hell is vary hell
SPIDERZ
06Eeyup~
SPPPPPPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDEEEEEEEEERRRRRRZZZZZZ

Spidersecks?
EVERYTHING WAS BIGGER AND 8
07,01Octavia is unbanned already
13Big Mac Spider
SPIDERS! GET EM OFF ME! GET EM OFF ME
I <3 free speech but also recognize that certain topics ruin chat for people... which the primary objective of chat is to talk to others while you watch the movie
OH GOD NOT SPIDERSES
im arachnophobic :C
epic feel time
arachnaphobia hated understands her fear :#
3Yeah I saw
06Big mac dog
THEY'RE IN MY EYES!

Spiders don't scare me
BIG MAC SPIDER DOG
08,01oh SuperBrony...
giant ass hoardes of spiders scare me
spiderses..... 0_o
13It still feels weird Spiderses is so known now. One of the local bronies here wrote it. He comes to the meets.
oh god why LordCelestia
agreed
ORLY?!?!
In Ohio?
3Streams! Y U NO WORK?
I want a local brony club
where goes the line?
13Yes, OH

who decides that?
fluttercry: make one
wow
the mods
how can you know?
The mods
it's a small world
Spiderses...? what is that
That being said, I don't get offended over practically anything...
Byebye DashWithRainbows
you don't
You were warned
That's at the discretion of the mod.
no bronys here >_<
so IDGAF
13Hes got a lot of red facial hiar that makes me giggle. Hes pretty random and funny.
bye DashWithRainbows
Combustible, can you change nic?
you just buck up and apoligises when you cross it
yeah
well, yeah i was warned, and i stopped
bye DashWithRainbows :)
take care dashwithrainbows :D
/me hugs DashWithRainbows goodbye
06This lady is a jerk D;
Sleep well!
07,01alright now i'm clueless
what dari said I guess
You needed to be warned several times
why?
You should use your own common sense when posting though.
06Bai Dashie~
She's dead and crazy
sleep well dashwithraibows dream of ponies 4 me
You continued after you were warned.
bye DashWithRainbows
this lady is not a jerk she is in hell
I'm too lazy to log out and back in :P
"common sense"
sleep well dashwithrainbows dream of ponies 4 me
well, just a little bit
Did somebody say CANNON?
/me prepares his moon cannon.
3You need to set an exemption methinks
CloudRunner: Spiderses is the best Fanfic since Repercussion of Evil
07,01I did...
Common sense, you knew it would be sore topic with users.
HIS?
You posted it anyway.
HIS!?!?
08,01it put him to -e agian
08,01again*
07,01yea..
And then John was a zombie
i didn't know it would be THAT sensitive
MALESTIA
I may have to read it.
Fair enough, you were warned to stop.
You continued.
/me puts a hoof to Pegacorn's mouth
i believed my right for free speech was greater
I was just curious.
LordCelestia? I may have to attack you if you shout that one.
/me smacks Pegacorns ass
[ger]Brony1: It wont make me overly emotional due to a death will it?
YOU'LL WAIT TILL THIS IS OVER
but i stopped pretty soon after warnings
Shhh. The big ponies are talking.
/me cannot be attacked. He only attacks.
Seriously dude... you're misinterpreting that right
what exactly did i say after being warned?
Well, Spike got killed, but he gets better.
I am Lasharus. Trust me, I can attack.
Rights don't apply here where they have rules
:P
07,01alright we need Dari :)
/me kicks Polarfire in the face
yeah
Possibly.
SOULESS BITCH
^mean
but true
hehe
Ghehe.
easy Pegacorn, we'll continue playing with you soon~
/me reminds pegacorn that he is chained up, and can't kick anything
Bottom line, you have been banned before, you've had warnings, you won't get any more chances from me, you ignore mods again and I will ban you. With no appeal.
how long left for this film btw, i have to go to bed :(
She managed it in Party of One though.
geez, gohsties already said all that
/me grabs Pegacorn's legs and tightens the chain to the wall anchor
And, CloudRunner: Nopony is getting made into baken goods in that fanfic.
i'd guess 20 minutes
she wasn't physically less bouncy
she just didn't feel like bouncy
No, I need to add them to the access list.
Give me a minute.
spoilers they all die
I think she actually WALKED in that episode.
what did I miss?
[ger]Brony1: ok. so long as nopony gets their head kicked in or cut to bits I should be ok
Any questions?
What did she tear up?
and i asked again: what exactly did i say AFTER being warned?
Spoilers:He died
07,01see we needed dari :P
this still flashback?
she walks in the pilot episodes
Their divorce papers
/me hugs CloudRunner
08,01lololol

:)
13:P
looks like it
spoiler: they see dead ppl
im gonna laugh if he died or sumthin and/or this is just dream
Yip.
10,2Lol fluttercry 
i'm kinda sorry for that, but only kinda :P
is this the robin williams movie with heaven/hell?
Wow, the Broncoes are getting their shit kicked.
Yes
I don't have to explain myself, and my reasoning to you, nor do any of the mods. On this occasion I'll humour you though. Give me a minute.
and pinkie never walks, she just bounces closer to the ground
I can see the dead.
like always RAWRity. But I still root for them every time they play
he did die
What comes may dream
long 3 min
ahh
:P
He did die...that's what the whole movie is about
why do i smell of curry?
Spoiler: Bruce Willis is dead in that movie.

To answer your question...

06,15I don't think so, [ger]Brony1
oh shit RAWRity
HA FIGHTS
HILARIOUS
I think I should have arrived earlier.... when the movie started, maybe...
Lets not go into religious arguments: a.k.a. shut the hell up about religion already
07,01le sigh
i think i even explained that
04HEAVEN OR HELL!
My friend wants to see someone die, because he is a HEARTLESS BASTARD
04FIGHT!
that i DID tolerate everypony
Must have happened while i blinked then :(

^thanks. im showing my friend the beauty of inb4's
and then they lived happily ever after...in hell
you just ruined the moment.....
Take your time Luna
Yeah, sound issues, according to Luna in the main channel.
umm...
oh crap I thought I did that by joining the main room again
Luna paused it
i was alreayd typing out when the warning was given, i didn't see it until i was done
so I've never had a chance to see this movie, but did it end up being "B" because it's really bad, or because its message is beyond most people?
06>:
06,15Yeah it's one of those moments, [ger]Brony1, I missed it too :P
o ok thought it was a death lag spike
lol fluttercry just said something the real fluttershy would say
server: I accadently the connection is that bad?
Point is, situation is over. You made a mistake. If you don't agree, you're free to leave.
I do agree.
Yes, Rainbow_Derp, it is very bad.
I did wrong. Eeeyup.
You're computer will proceed to esplode.
ok that one was lag
is it paused...?
I'm not sure if they're going for B movies this week.
yes
yep
3YFW I know the command to do that
Because of you, WE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!!
darn, ninja'd.
But i didn't mean to do anything wrong or hurt anyone.
3But I don't have the access :(
Whoo!
Oh really, you were writing three comments at the same time? val posted at 23:39, you posted at 23:41 twice
07,01and back
a networkcable has come unpluged.
:)
and then explode again!
You always did wrong Bjornfot.
Nice work Luna. :)
aaalways
oh that's right. Return to Harmony is supposed to play after this.
Love ya Luna :)
k ima try and fix it here i go http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/cbed75f048a964280b9b985d0b529c0d/4236%20-%20applejack%20applestare%20photo%20photoshop%20pinkie_pie%20rainbow_dash%20server.jpg
I had to reload my chat tab
i wanna be with you
hey, is that Robin Williams?
and make believe with you
lol
Nope. Chuck Testa
but...not funny robin williams.
and live in harmony harmony OH LOVE
this is oscar mode robin williams
lol
04What TheMaster said
/me smacks Pegacorn's ass
Why doesn't Williams do good movies anymore?
OSCAR MODE, TRANSFORM!
TO HARMONY.
im gonna laugh if she truns around all like "LEAVE ME ALONE. STRANGER DANGER!"
btw dari, is it against the rules or something to make a PM log publicly available?
lol
or Bi-centenarian man mode
He won an Oscar for this?! Must have been a slow year in Hollywood.
W00t! Just got out of work and I missed the Lion King! Who has two thumbs and is majorly sad? This guy!
its what happens when good actors make to many good movies. they become too expensive.
or he's just tired.
i think that's more of a server thing than a #bronystate thing...
guts... and sweetness...?
scorchman don't worry, they're-streaming it after this
I dont want another cupcakes bassed on this
I love hamlet with lions personally.
she's still discordified
he was off naming his kid zelda and making Gameboy ad's
everything went better than expected
lol
More precisely: Is it ok if I pastebin Ghosties and mine conversation?
CloudRunner: have you read Fluttershy Goes to Hell?
she's going to take out her rape whistle any second now, I know it
Quite a few people have requested it.
cya guys later, need to do chores.
I HATE YOU GGGALA
it's possabely against the law
bye you
See ya scorch!
And since it's sent rhough the internet on a public server...
it's a private convosation
You played a game you couldn't win. You got trolled by god.
We don't have any actual rules about it.
04RAEP TIEM!
Though that makes the whole 'private message' system rather null.
thats pretty awful rawrity.
06,15Yeah I fail to see the amazing or the sad here...
thus making it public with out all partys consent is an privicy issue
mostly because he assaulted me
did i miss it?!
Time for hell
Ghosties: HELL YEAH!
miss what?
FOREVER AND EVER
lol Broncos
hes so creepy
not really any different from pasting an IM convo from anywhere, nothing to do with #BronyState
oh ok there is a stream going
:P
today tomarrow and forever
Hey again Scar.
ohai tarin
he was very upset, and i understand that and forgive him, and he has apologized
oh hai lash
inb4 he wins anyways
epic feel time
do you know what the schedule for this theatre is?
then we let it lie
hey, when is he going to start raeping her?
lol
almost over I think?
simple as
:p
but i thought it might be a good example
...
NOW.
yeah.
that mods aren't perfect either
All I know is that there'll be 2 pony episodes after this film, then a restream of the Lion King, apparently.
I keep hovering over the movie to see how much time is left.
RAEP TIEM
they are people
lol Tovler, I used to do that too.
i meant what days do they stream?
it's hard to be objective all the time
I like that better than my anser :D
god do I know it
he only said all those things because it was private
going to do some chores. brb.
We never claimed to be perfect.
06,15Moar epic CG plox!!1
GAME OVER.
I've modded some flamly forums
DOOOM
"Enough with the shakin', it's time to get RAPIN'!"
DON'T GIVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Friday/Saturday
and suddenly they're both playing amnesia
its sunday....
he would never have said all that in a channel
CONTINUE? [y] [n]
THIS SUMMER, ROBIN WILLIAMS IS....ORPHEUS
oh shit!
n
special event
oh look he saved her
You'd be surprised.
Game Over, Maaaaaan.
ah
SHOO BE DOO
but too late.
Shoo shoo be doo
so normally its just friday saturday?
04If he ws Orpheus, he failed a looooooooooooooooong time ago
WHAT
KABLAMMO
sonic waterboom
have you seen what he said?
Yup.
BOOM!
04He was never ever supposed to look at her
ok
Acid trip time!
when does it start?
I know Ghosties.
or rather how long ago did it
That I'm not sure about.
04And he did that as soon as he found her
lol
06,15Pillar of salt time, Ghosties? :P
time for a kick
this is dante's, not orpheus.
well, nobody said Robin Williams wasn't a Cock Up
pre-show on friday around 2pm EST, movies start around 7pm
ok
07,01correct
Put simplely mods have to follow their own rules. If they don't then they feel worthless at best
so at around 7 then
saturday the shows usually start around 2pm EST I think
04LUCY, I'M HOOOOOOOOOOOOOME
ok
"if you ever disrespect my feelings and my beliefs again I will thoroughly and actively make sure that you don't get a chance to see another movie with us"
you know. I don't think that place would be heaven for someone with allergies
sounds good
creepers gonna creep
and this part is new to me, didn't catch it the first time I saw it
07,01also all information is in our newsletter, facebook, google+ and twitter
sadfaicv
I brought groceries!
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Daddy!
04NO
if i had any of those...
HAPPEH FAIC
04GET AWAY, YOU FREAK
08,01did he win?!
HE DID IT
is this the part where he gets out his top and spins it but we dont see it fall?
that's just way over the line and personal
GOOD END
06,15and then everypony came.... the end
lol yes Sumica.
GAME OVER.
i even said i didn't disrespect anything
04I DON'T KNOW YOU! *pawnch*
bug Luna to get yourself on the email list :)
agreed
they're in heaven :o
07,01indeed
what's weird is, earlier today I was watching Jumanji
oh cool
eh, dante's divine comedy is just a self-insert fanfic
it's like it's Robin Williams day
hey luna, im bugging you
he died in hell and is now in double heaven.
inb4 a "Everybody died. The end" reference.
bug bug bug
You've broken rules, he's within his rights to ban you.
That's not very nice.
07,01PM me your e-mail
Just ask politely.
I don't know you, but you are a hot pussy, so i will act, like i am your husband.
07,01and i'll add you
04Can you do that? Can you die twice?
:P
of course
but everybody DID die.
huh, seems like he made sure to complete that post-final dungeon to get the best ending
but everybody did die, like in the first 20 min of the movie.
lordcelestia little late 4 dat
but that was just very biased and personal
daw damn it all
08,01to the mooonaaaaaaaaaaah
Mandatory "They all died. The end." LordCelestia :3
hell the kids did't even make it through the opening credits
HEY
this is kinda embarrasing, how do i do that/
MOON
thatsssss a nice alternate reality u have there
That's how ghosties is :/
IS
XD
FOR
It may have been, but it also only applies when you break a rule which is general.
ME
:3
nvm
07,01double click my name
I figured that out my 2nd day here
Double-click Luna's name in the list of users to your right.
:P
nope.avi
you are on a train!
I like trains
All you have to do is take a cup of flour....
or waiting for one
choo-choo!
I forget the quote
Add it to the mix!
several months ago now
He has to go deeper.
:$
Trains rock
once there was a happy family. They were so happy that everyone died. The end :3
Welcome back, The_Si
ghosties is ghosties
You are waiting on a train but you dont know where it's going.
Darnit, I missed an opportunity to quote "HIGHWAY TO HELL. I'MMONA HIGHWAY TO HELL".
F*** YEAH TRAINS
Therefore how personal it may seem is irrelevant, it'd be the same as if he'd said "you disregard our rules again and I'll ban you".
Cbe
critickitten you got it wrong: All you have to do is take a cup of pony, add it to the mix
*Cheers
yeah, he's human too
And Bjornfot is Bjornfot, so...
but then Bjornfot is Bjornfot
seriously, what if you had allerges or were afraid of outdoors?
THEREFORE
NO RAWRITY NOT CUPCAKES
totally not heaven
it's not a valid argument
DAMN YOU
ninja'd, Dumori
I <3 EVERYONE
The power of love <3
i agree with him
then you change it, TheMaster.
and i still love him
Bjornfot is Bjornfot?MY GOD.
I'd make it a metropolis, I s'pose.
good news mom the kids are back. bad news they dont look like you any more.
If you even talk about cupcakes I will KILL you.
yeeeerrr!
What happens if the real pictures get burned to dust in RL, because they are not worth anything?
so my heaven would be watching mlp fim forever
SHUTUP
POISONALLY
what movie is this?
NEW SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY
Hm, true, they should add a cup of pony to this film.
/me smacks pegacorns ass again
Bjornfot=Bjornfot
suddly creeper.
"oh look, your dog is in heaven too"
SSSSSSSSSSSS
noooo
DOGGY!
"What Dreams May Come" I think
are they in a painting?
MAMA IM COMIN HOME
YES
More or less.
suddenly there are no more black people in the movie
DAMNIT POLARFIRE
YES
inafter sappy ending.
i killed so many creepers
Didn't they have 2 kids?
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
everyone is dead and happy!
It's the gay daughter
today
so does everyone end up in heaven at the same age/size that they died?
one kid is the dog now.
Y U NO PHYSICS?!
/me stuffs a rag in Pegacorns mouth
DAT HAPPY ENDING <3
So wait, are they all alive again?
dogs go to heaven. problem, catholics?
and then they went to hell, The End
They look like they want to, TheMaster.
oh, cool.
I'd like to be a tree
They're all dead. By that point physics sort of takes a back seat to events.
04No, they're all dead but in Heaven
Combustiblelemons: only good dogs
sumica kind of. You get to choose your appearance
running hug scene? really? i am disappoint...
woah, 100% completion ending! sweet!
Nope, they all live in that paintings of hers.
so what if you wanted to look like someone else?
Now we are a family again
/me spits the rag out
physics are overrated
and they all stayed dead happly ever after.
not like hitler dog
I have to say though the lines in #BronyState are wonky
This ending needs to be about 20% sexier.
i wonder if there's such a thing as an evil dog
uhu
I think they're fine
themaster you can. that was part of the twists in the movie.
"All Dogs go to Heaven"
Yes. Sooooo, where is the sun? He stayed in hell?
/me am dissapoint
we get one religious "attack" big flames
brb gonna eat some oats.
awwwwww
Obey the rules set out and if there is confusion ask a mod
*son
and then Wheatly falls like an asteroid kills everyone again
THE END
right now theres a hell of a lot of "attacks" on homosexuality
true deliopen
See you in hell again huh.
atm?
LOL The sun stayed in hell, [ger]Brony1?
They need to go to SPAAAAAAAAAACE
I do think the mods are being overly strict, though.
FOREEVER
yeah on and off
SPAAAAAAACE
Combustiblelemons: Ceberus
what if they reincarnate as bad people? then they'd be in hell.
07,01beautiful movie Ghosties...
/me stuffs the rag back in Pegacorn's mouth and ties a rope around him, holding it in
07,01I've never seen this before...
you cant find her in jersey
Sssshhh...
no love sweeter than one that transcends time and space and even heaven itself
Jersey's nothing like Hull
jersey is super hell
er, Hell
Im in space! bap bap bapbap bap bap bap
people calling out their daughter as gay repatedly due to short hair
it was nice.
I agree, great movie.
Really awesome movie.

/me hugs everypony

Hehehehehehe
I'll just have to remind him of his role as guildkiller in WoW.
ohoho
I watched it. The de-synch is because of lag, sadfaic
04Like Val said, thank you guys for joining us this weekend for celebrating Brony State's 6 month anniversary. Here's hoping to plenty more months of awesome streaming!
Stream the vid
woot
any movie in which George Carlin gets to be a catholic priest is amazing.
Yeah i killed like 6 raid guilds in my time in wow
I've been here about two months (right before my breakup) and I have not regretted it since. Everyone here is sooooo cool and it's given me the chance to see (or re-see) a lot of movies.
i was the kiss of death ;D
I've tried to sing along on pony tf2 server micspam, but it doesn't work from lag
simple as Bjornfot might have corss the line frist
Give or take.
04Oh, and whoever was glad I picked the film, you are welcome
/me hugs Bronystate
WoW is a guildkiller in WoW 6_9
04Glad I could share it with you
PLAY PONY VIDEOS. NOW

Every guild he joined with me died shortly after.
but Mod should stay behind it even then
doctor who movie
this is why i move to swtor
it was a good pick ghosties
yep, it's aalways me
OI! not all
can i just say: i've only been here a few weeks, and already Bronystate has made my weekends a lot happier. I simply love this community!
Mods are here, POST PONIES
i'm always to blame
I mean say I slaged any pony off over PM
I left one of them before it died...
enuff credits, we need moar ponehs
So, what's next?
VINTAGE Ghosties!

Vinter Vrap Up

The stock market is more stable than my pony list
NOPE
I wondered all the time: What was Twilight thinking?! They never had been in that labyrinth at all.
THE ELEMENTS ARENT IN THERE. STOP WASTING YOUR TIME
ohshi-\
He already broke freee...
Q is Q-ing again
IT'S NOT IN THE MOTHERF***ING LABYRINTH
Yeah what I said!
Maneiac
oh
We still need to secure him again.
Nope.
Pary hard!
hehehehe
because she told her ponies to fix it and said forgetaboutit
Pinkie and Applejack are probably like"HA HA!"
so why is he yelling?
07,01muhahahaha!
pinkie and AJ: meh.
I'm still on the wall.
you just realized that when Fluttershy said can we go home now? they would have not been "Discorded"
Priceless!
"We're as useless as Applejack!"
you mean faggetaboutit
07,01he's sooo Tim!
GGG Y U LIE?
13Oh Discord, y u so troll?
Well, in fairness, Celestia DID act in this time by sending all those letters.
YOU'RE ALL USELESS EARTH PONIES NOW!
Creeper!
That counts for something.
true
BAD TOUCH!
the game?
ooo someone in bronystate just made a good point
There are no rules in Calvinball
so he's on the wall not wanting to be free and yelling
13Oooh dang Dashite
Discord invaded your personal bubble, what do you do?
07,01eeenope
why?
if they had gone home when fluttershy asked to
He had so much fun here. He's basically playing Q again
DISCORD WHY!
they'd all be fine
Think of the game!
Problem is, there's no rule that HE can't cheat...
except how would she know those were needed unless she was watching the whole time
He should steal the Earth pony's legs.
only because she doesnt like chocolate milks of glass
/me feels bad because of the earthpony hate
Mmhmm. :P
lulz
*wah wah wah waaaahhhhh*
nope
I bet Lancie wished he could stay on the show
TOGETHER! (gets separated)
lmao dari xD
Discord is the true AI Director!
13Fluttershy <3
If I don't play the game, I don't lose :D
milk of glass chocolate?
07,01powerpowies!
I'm not asking to be free since i know that the anwser will be no.
because Discord.
aww poor fluttershy
and thus, fluttershy flips the fuck out
awww
13Shes so dang cute
WE SHOULD TAKE DISCORD, AND PUT HIM IN ALL THE EPISODES
Dari, he doesn't need to take anything from the earth ponies.
08,01:<
TheMaster: That would be nice to find out
poor flootershy
08,01I'm all alone ;_____;

You though of it, Combustiblelemos, You loose.

It's a TRAP!
Yeah there's no maybe about that...

i thought her screams were supposed to be silent.
Have Discord return without powers and trying to adjust to being mort-...wait, where have I heard this before?

/me freaken loves Tom
I just love that evil laugh.
<3 I love that Rarity squeal!
/me starts rubbing pegacorn's wings. Oh your feathers are so neat, would be a shame to not show them off
IT
also I thought his name was Dan
Tom Dan says
You aren't ticklish here, are you?
[ger]Brony1, same here
Its Tom. Not Dan
MIIIIIINE!
HERE COMES TOM
I love rarity's voice in this scene
Ohgodno.
rarity wins so much in these 2 episodes
/me is now eating nachos and salsa.
It's Tom Dan
MEIN!
07,01MINE!
IT'S TIME FOR EVERYPONY'S FAVORITE ROCK, TOM!!!
MIIIINE
her VA had so much fun with the ham
RarityxTom
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[ger]Brony1: you like whips and chains dont you?
rarity has the best voice actress
Greedity and Tom
BUT SHE JUST GOT A PONY PEDI!
What is there not to like?
/me begins fondling the base of his wing at the joint
Oh hai, Tom!
I think he likes it
[ger]Brony1: lol

13Tom is best pony!
It's not just a boulder. ITS A ROCK! A ROOOOCKK. It's a BIG... BEAUTIFUL... OLD... ROCK! Oh the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles. And it's in GREAT SHAPE!

LordCelestia I LOVE THAT VIDEO!

That rock has taken a fair bit of damage over those two episodes.
lol LordCelestia
Rarity and Tom made Rocky
Stop it.Stop it.Stop.STOOOOOOOOOOP!
Glas it got a positive reaction :D
Tomabuse
one of my favourite spongebob scenes
Tom is best inanimate object

Noted.
awwwww
But still.
LordCelestia, enjoy you internets, you deserve 'em
Flutterwry incoming...
13Why does that sound familiar...
I was just thinking of something: What if, in S2, Rarity and Fluttershy sing a duet?
Being smashed through a library wall? Twice?
Poor Fluttershy :(
08,01:<
13Oh yeah, Spongbob I think
its only a thin wooden wall
well it is a big thing
This is possibly my favourite scene of this episode.
trollershy
Trolling the Troll
you probably could have punched through it
"OH FOR GOODNESS' SAKE!"
*facehoof*
hollow trees aren't so tough
07,01AH!

lol
uh oh
07,01you are a fluttershy fan!
I <3 her in this scene
This is why I love her
07,01your in the wrong room!
Discord gets owned a bit here.
this episode reminds me of this arc: http://www.pholph.com/whole_arc_viewer.php?id=5&sid=1375
13Oh Fluttershy <3
inb4 discord cheats
Fluttershy is discord-resistant
/me glares
13So darn cute
Discord is HIM in general
flutterbitch is best evil pony
Fluttershy doesn't feed the troll
Fluttersnide
Nope, Twilight is my favourite. Sorry Luna.
/me spreads his other hoof across the wing's underside, stroking Polarfire's feathers
Stood up to giant dragon and stared down a cockatrice? YUP, WEAK AND HELPLESS
/me is reminded of that comic where creeps him out.
OH HE MAN
But I still adore this scene.

Flutterbitch entertaiened EVERYONE at BroNYCon
and time to cry manly tears of manlyness
WHEVER YOU LIVE, I KNOW IT
You know, I recall there only being two rules and neither of them dealt with this so Discord didn't cheat...
anyone else notice that Discord always disguises up as their respective cutie marks?
Everyone calm the fuck down
Come at me bro!
Inb4 he cheats again
07,01yep
inb4 Sadistic Choice

Why would Cloudsdale crumble because of the absence of one lousy small-town weather pony?

*le sob*
her friends or her birthplace
Till the end of this pony episode
best part is there is no game
whyy dashie whyyyy
Listen to his umbrella carefully btw.
why does she not lie here?
RAWRity, Discord isn't a participant in the game.
It's all in your mind.
?
Brony1: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY??
We get to see part two now, right? :D
the only winning move is not to play
To those of you who hadn't heard it before - it meows. There is no way to argue with that much awesome.
It. Is. ON!
DUN DUN DUN
I thought the ending of part2 was a bit rushed, but the rest was really good.
/me clings to Octavia's plot... I dont know why

rarity is more kick ass than people think
every time she kicks something in the face the show becomes more awesome
he likes to comment on us from time to time
I'm mostly wondering why the hell he's talking about bronies, what's so horrible/awesome about it, etc.
I am Discord, huh!
I didn't know that.
the troll has fun
lol
Twilight's friends, but she doesn't notice the color change

Twilight Sparkle : -_- wat... the... fuck...
Okay, I'm really going now
rarity DID kick a Manticore in the face after all

Pinkie saw them
Now they're obi wan kenobi style ghosts?
Discord changed their colors, but didn't notice them change back
Don't let Pega get bored when he gets back
