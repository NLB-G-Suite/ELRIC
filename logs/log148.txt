3Meh, worth the risk
/me hugs Fluttershy'
/me 8twitches

08,01tabfail
08,01XD
hey Denied_Existence try to mindfuck me
lol
thanks, I guess
nah
08,01be prepared -whispers it-
just don't do anything you'll regret while I'm gone, okay Fluttershy'? :)
just try it
I fucking dare you
My body is ready, D_E.
08,01okay
/me has a moon cannon in case of emergencies.
08,01maybe
and a minigun.
nah
good song
I can accept the truth
3Did you know I can walk through two doors at once?
well
it is possible
I suppose.
3Go ahead, how do you think it is?
Would portals count as doors?
3I am talking about in our universe.
done
Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
YOU MUST GO DEEPER
well
then
doorception maybe?
3Nope, our universe, remember.
no u cant yes i can
3Two /regular/ doors
CAAAAAN
3Nope, still wrong
meh
fuck it
yes i can
3Any more guesses, or should I explain it?
Go for it.
08,01wait
08,01no
08,01never mind
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII CANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
08,01thought I had it
3...
NO not this song. I can't understand the words!
3Oh, derp
3No, that was a completely different mindfuck
I want to hear that mindfuck
or a window
or wall
3door*
bluh i need to get this song, i dont have it
3Yes.
Emergency exit, maybe.
3Natleyn is correct
3And if you are outside, how do you get in?
Entrance.
3Correct again.
08,01ooooh
08,01now it makes sense
It is both entrance and exit.
3Exactly
08,01both the entrance and the exit at the same time lol
3And if I go through it, i am going through two doors.
Assuming you're not multidimensional, you technically only use it one way, though.
08,01how it is a mindfuck thouhg?
3Although I am going through one backwards
08,01it's just... clever mind puzzles?
I don't get the way of that being a mind fuck at all
In which case it acts as one or another....
3That was ontop of several other things
3That was just the coup de grace
is that why she wants to murder Silvermane?
hmmm
but is hard to actually probe
*prove
also it's all about perspective
08,01Silver is a player -_-
3SB was asking me about how his mod application went
id imagine he is
heheh
3I told him that I could not disclose that
yeah he is
3He told me the conversation did not exist.
Hah.
3I then proceeded into some Shrodinger arguments about waveform
Lmao.
Schrodinger arguments.
3I argued that the conversation both existed and did not exist at the same time
3But since I was seeing the conversation, at the time it did.
08,01Shroedinger's cat
08,01lawl
well I'm listening to 'People=Shit'
08,01love quantum physics
Revolver: MY CAT IS DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
ect ect
congratulations
08,01lol
Or maybe it isn't, or maybe it is, or maybe it isn't...~
3Really? I think he is alive.
Or did I?
Maybe I didn't.
08,01Then again
did you?
08,01he's alive
08,01somehow
DId I have a cat? o_O
08,01in another dimension
well
At one point I did, but I think we gave him away.
I was speaking in this dimension
We're not allowed to have pets, but that one time was an exception...
but in an alternate dimension that is possible
seeing as every decision branches off from each other into an alternate universe and keeps on going
meaning
there is an endless amount of alternate universes
3there are*
3*trollface*
fuck grammar
Well, they interacted with the cat.
and spelling
Either I hallucinated them acting with the cat, which I'm fine with, or there was a cat.
Kitty <3
skroo the laws uf speling
and I didn't have one of my ex-girlfriends try to cut my balls off because she thought I was cheating on her when we were together
or did I?
08,01hmmmm
08,01ouch
Ooh.
I hit her with a baseball bat
3...
or did I?
3Well then
and I still have everything on my body
or do I?
3I theorize that you do
3Or you might be more solemn about it
well I do
3Kinky
no
they are still on my body
08,01hehe
seriously
yeah
08,01this conversation has totally gone down the toilet
Revolver: Alrighty.
that was fun
I would not talk about it if I didn't have them on my body still
/me shrugs
then she calmed down
This is still light for me~
me too
Awwww
08,01ELIPHINO!
don't ask why I said oi
because I don't really know either
NICE ONE, revolver
I learned from the best
08,01at this rate anyway
(im still watching the stream)
08,01me too )
Revolver, same, though I haven't had as much experience using it as you.
meh
close enough for me
Time to do the time warp again
/me brohoofs Revolver
3Its just a step to the left!
We did it totally reversed
08,01you... die in one dimension, but at the same time are still alive at the same time
backwards mind fuck.
08,01still alive in the other dimension*
meh
08,01and don't exist and do exist
08,01but you don't really exist
08,01you just think you do
not really mindfuck worthy
Ive had that happen to me before
It was interesting feeling
aaaah
08,01See, you're actually visible to everybody but yourself... or perhaps you are invisible to everybody else and only you can see yourself?
Shadenpony :D
Wee need to go to the reverse-verse, home of tac nayn, the sworn enemy of nyan cat!
08,01it's like trying to comprehend how we speak
Where would I be now if it wasn't for me being hospitalized for a month after getting the Swine Flu and having a sever asthmatic reaction...
init natleyn.os
3If you die in one dimension, you die in all of them...
running.....
08,01and then we can spout it all out
well
08,01how our mind pieces it together
08,01and how we arrange it and understand it
08,01basically we can just speak
08,01and we spout out words
08,01but our mind is putting them together
08,01somehow
Hello everypony :P
08,01SCHROEDINGER'S CAT
I'm trying to get ponies to mindfuck me.
3Or are you a perma-thrall?
/me 8sticks a finger into Natleyn's ear. "You are now mindfucked."
Denied_Existence: Some bruises on the noggin' and a couple hundred thousand brain cells lost, but I'm recovering.
3Darn, well I can always re-thrall you if need be.
It's actually quite painful :D
08,01AHHHH

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxhFd_vr7Rc
Thumb drive brings portability.
I could use dropbox/my own webspace/etc but that has one limitation
My upload bandwidth is insanely low
Compared to the one on the thumbdrive
or freeezie
oh my, I did not think luna would put that one on here.
I showed it to her as a joke.
Ee-yup
As in, you typically have no control over the security.
They really freaked out because they spotted some odd bits moving around
And pretty much had the entire userbase reset their passwords and encryption keys to make sure all the encrypted bits on their server that might have been stolen were worthless
And they were not even sure anything was stolen
They just spotted some odd traffic in their network
Paranoid? Yes
Heh, animated Ponygeist banner
It's awesome :P

Oh god...2007 was fucking awesome.
maplestory used to be the shit too
Yup.

then i quit
It went through 3 changes
But one change was actually good.
mfw i had this playing while playing Halo Reach and completely raped asses
Streamlag anyone?
Yup.

oh.. didn't realize there was a stream going on
/me logs into runescape in the first time in 2 years
I spent about 11 months getting to level 100 in maplestory, to later find out I could get to level 100 in a month
Feels bad man
and said hey noobs, you can level easy
I still havent got to level 90 in RS
Or got a masters cape
Feels bad
Never got into Maplestory.
I played maplestory until i got to level 39
early maplestory was the shit
I lost interest after that
Has anybody played runescape here through 2007-2009?
I sure did.
quit*

o:
they either didn't talk to you when you were clearly talking to them or they were scammers or just punks

08,01guess who's gay?
...And?

06ThePretender: Get paid for it, therefor undercutting free.

dari, implying there is no such thing as a stupid belief?
10,2Bjornfot: Move away from the topic. Just watch the movie.
/me is off to get dressed and find food

You can't just apply that here

For me, there is no 'free speech' here.
08,01huh?
/me already has the picture

we're near the end.
pinkie can never be less bouncy
06After this thehated :#

You can't say things that break rules here, that's how I feel.
different time zones
But doesnt she recognize her own husband???
08,01I think he just got banned.
its only 6 here
no, she doesn't remember her family at all
she's on cocaine
I guess not.
Exactly. You can't go saying things somewhere if the mods don't want you to

The mods
That being said, I don't get offended over practically anything...

You were warned
That's at the discretion of the mod.
yeah
well, yeah i was warned, and i stopped
06This lady is a jerk D;
Sleep well!
07,01alright now i'm clueless
You needed to be warned several times

You continued after you were warned.
I'm too lazy to log out and back in :P
"common sense"
well, just a little bit
Did somebody say CANNON?
/me prepares his moon cannon.
3You need to set an exemption methinks
07,01I did...
Common sense, you knew it would be sore topic with users.
HIS?
You posted it anyway.
HIS!?!?
08,01it put him to -e agian
08,01again*
07,01yea..
i didn't know it would be THAT sensitive
MALESTIA
I may have to read it.
Fair enough, you were warned to stop.
You continued.
i believed my right for free speech was greater
I was just curious.
YOU'LL WAIT TILL THIS IS OVER
but i stopped pretty soon after warnings
/me cannot be attacked. He only attacks.
Seriously dude... you're misinterpreting that right
Rights don't apply here where they have rules
:P
07,01alright we need Dari :)
/me kicks Polarfire in the face

3Sorry luna, I think Chanserv hates us today
Possibly.

/me grabs Pegacorn's legs and tightens the chain to the wall anchor

she just didn't feel like bouncy
No, I need to add them to the access list.
Give me a minute.

Yip.
i'm kinda sorry for that, but only kinda :P
Wow, the Broncoes are getting their shit kicked.
Yes
I don't have to explain myself, and my reasoning to you, nor do any of the mods. On this occasion I'll humour you though. Give me a minute.
and pinkie never walks, she just bounces closer to the ground
he did die

oh crap I thought I did that by joining the main room again
Luna paused it
i was alreayd typing out when the warning was given, i didn't see it until i was done
06>:
server: I accadently the connection is that bad?
Point is, situation is over. You made a mistake. If you don't agree, you're free to leave.
I do agree.
is it paused...?
yes
yep
Because of you, WE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!!
darn, ninja'd.
But i didn't mean to do anything wrong or hurt anyone.
3But I don't have the access :(

scorchman don't worry, they're-streaming it after this
she's still discordified
he was off naming his kid zelda and making Gameboy ad's

See ya scorch!
We don't have any actual rules about it.
04RAEP TIEM!
06,15Yeah I fail to see the amazing or the sad here...
thus making it public with out all partys consent is an privicy issue
mostly because he assaulted me
lol Broncos
oh ok there is a stream going
:P
he was very upset, and i understand that and forgive him, and he has apologized
oh hai lash
epic feel time
then we let it lie
hey, when is he going to start raeping her?
lol
simple as
:p
but i thought it might be a good example
...
NOW.
yeah.
I keep hovering over the movie to see how much time is left.
RAEP TIEM

That I'm not sure about.
04And he did that as soon as he found her
lol
time for a kick

inb4 a "Everybody died. The end" reference.
That's not very nice.
Just ask politely.

Do you want to get down?

oh
We still need to secure him again.
Pary hard!
hehehehe
because she told her ponies to fix it and said forgetaboutit
Pinkie and Applejack are probably like"HA HA!"
07,01muhahahaha!
I'm still on the wall.
you just realized that when Fluttershy said can we go home now? they would have not been "Discorded"
Priceless!
you mean faggetaboutit
Well, in fairness, Celestia DID act in this time by sending all those letters.
That counts for something.
BAD TOUCH!
There are no rules in Calvinball
07,01eeenope
why?
if they had gone home when fluttershy asked to
they'd all be fine
Problem is, there's no rule that HE can't cheat...
except how would she know those were needed unless she was watching the whole time
He should steal the Earth pony's legs.
only because she doesnt like chocolate milks of glass
/me feels bad because of the earthpony hate
Mmhmm. :P
I bet Lancie wished he could stay on the show
TOGETHER! (gets separated)
