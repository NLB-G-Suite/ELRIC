?
ewwww Dari, cover your mouth when you sneeze
god, it's all over me now
0lol, Val
:P
Sounds hot
lol dari

0i just can't bring myself to hate you ValtheJean. you make me laugh too much
I like the taste of your body Dari
Silvermane: <3
0plus, i'm a brony, and i know no hate.
0EXCEPT FOR SNAKES
what?
0inb4 boss fight
/me is LONG NECK REACTION GUY right now.
you hate adorable little snakes? :(
ohai AE ;3
LOL
hi Angel
I'd still hit it
0RobotPinkie, i was talking in-character for the show. everypony is afraid of snakes
blarg
^
0lol EdwardNewgate
looks like I've gotta get packing now
0i personally love snakes
13o-o
02<Nick> the vids alone is impossible to watch!
02Nah, I'm used to the bullet hell thing
02BUT IN THIS TOUHOU
02DEATHBOMBING IS IMPOSSIBRUUUU
13ohai :3
I have to take of lads
have a good time, and enjoy DURRRRRRRGARRRRRRR
well afraid and hate don't have to go hand in hand
bye Val
0peace valtheJean
;o
and in the event I don't come on later, have a good Monday and Tuesday
13:D
later ValtheJean
aw bai ValtheJean
later all
Did AE change IP/Locations?
inb4 Dari x ValtheJean
02Angel teach me how to deathbomb in MoF
02;AAAAA;
MWAHAHAHAHAH
0too late
Bye Val.
13I can't teach you LOL
13You have to learn to adapt like I did
Huh SilverMane?
02;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
13aka Bomb before the bullet actually hits you
/me cries
13and if you feel pressured, don't hold back on using a bomb
'sup Hipster_Brony
13because bombs are supplied by your power level
13so you can easily regain it back
Ohai Hipster
02But here is the point
o hai ponies
02I only used bombs in Deathbombing
0Vehrn makes this battle pathetic
When will we play requests dari?
02So...
02;A;
13Yep, so did I
Sup Hipster_Brony
Rayngel
13That's why I said you have to ADAPT
/me runs
0watch as he hits for like 500 damage
Also, >posting the events in a more timely manner
02+ I rush to much D:
12!Shipping
0well, 424 is what it would have been
13Once you learn to use bombs outside of deathbombing-only, it'll really help you in the long run even with other games :3
...we do it within 24 hours of PICKING THE MOVIES
Oo
12._.
yfw
13!espeon
0on the party
I'm not too impressed either, seems like the guy decided "eh, maybe I'll apply. I don't really want the job"
Do you have any previous IRC experience?
0just choose a party member
02In the first 5 stages I NEVER go at the bottom of the screen
0it protects them from magic
0so whoever is weakest against magic
02and that is followed by silly mistakes
i'll just wrap it up
inb4 Dari plays requests,but i'll still post my request.
this is a no for me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJEEy2IKOI8&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
02So.. ;A; x 2
Yeah, no for me as well
13That's kinda your own fault then :P
02Anyways, bbl :\
He doesn't seem to really want it
13Don't stick to certain patterns if they're not working
0dark damage heals her
L4D2 FTW
exactly
13change how you play so you can get through it easier
02Yeah, I should
@nick thanks
02But it's easier said than done
0get some heals up in this bitch
02:\
13You should adapt naturally over time
0i suggest tossing a potion at mardek
02Anyways back in 2-4 hours
He's still gonna die
0for security reasons
Limited at best.Most place I frequent have some sort of server set but short of basic commands I am new to it.
o.o
ill wait til i read the chat log, but if its a dedication issue, he shouldnt be hired
13especially as the more times you play through the stages, you'll get to know the bullet patterns and how its set out
SECURITY?NOPE.
yfw someone dies
02Yeah ;-;
02Anyways Kthxbai
0she's got one last turn before she dies
06:3
This is sorta boring in my opinion.
bbl
inb4 Nopony cares
Mardek Y U NO DIE
I see
inb4 ponies
0plus Teste Cookies, and DUUURRRRRRRRGGGGGAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNN
Banter from dari makes stuff fun.
inb4 Enema dies
Well, that concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now. I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.

0RobotPinkie, just wait for the Red XIII character reference in chapter 3
0HELLO WAIFU
Ohai Karma RainBroDash.I was expecting you.
icantypemynam.com
...i cant even type NAME.
really, SilverMane ? u sure about that?
Cant say I would do much for that one cupcakes comes up frequently enough as it is.
0sure about what
back
Red XIII is like... my favorite FF character
Might warn people off of it if they asked where it comes from.
0he was an awesome char
0i loved having him in my party
Second image:
Awesome limit breaks, too
-_-;
0indeed
0healing AND combat? What's not to like
How's it going RainBroDash?
The answer to this one is ask for the sauce. =D
10not that bad, but I'm suffering from allergies atm
10shit sux
0go there and find out; i think there is a key item now though
0or at least a valuable item
0talk to people
0someone has an item somewhere... let me do some research
Yeah that would get a warning to not do that again. Noting too grafic but the peoples minds work connections could be made.
When i think zombies,i think L4D.
Third image:
HELP
OHGOD
Rudoph: All the ways you wish you could be, that's me. I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck, I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.

>yfw I've had every single item possible + all enemy skills in FF7 on one playthrough
10LOL all that for 'I'm a woman!'
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS
10u so fail
standard shipping move along.
Fourth and final image:

I wub L4D.
0RobotPinkie, yfw i was about to get golden chocobo when my save file was erased by prick cousin
0Damage is normally more useful
FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU-
I'd be so pissed off
0but on Bosses, Poion is sexyful
?
This should be funny
I've had a ton of gold chocobos, though... Most of them on my most successful playthrough
had the entire stable filled with all gold chocobos :P
07I'm back
...he has to THINK about it is the funny part.
I already put my vote on the forums
...XD
+ some comments
0that's Final Fantasy
...wtf is wrong with people. Uh yeah would have to tell them not to post that.
Funny
0Chocobo is a giant yellow bird that will STOMP YO ASS
Like I said
lol
First one is hard as hell to get
0also, is fun to ride
funny yes
0yes, quite annoying
inb4 Riding
but once you figure out the quality of the chocobo doesn't matter so much...
I almost fell out of my chair.
Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
like excellent + excellent works, which it doesn't according to the Chocobo sage.
Do you have anything to add?
0you can wander off and find loot or push quest along or what not
He's such a fucking troll :P
"That's not nice : (, I'd send them an extra serious message with multiple frowney faces
And by "inb4 Riding",i meant "inb4 Somepony riding somepony",lulz.
I SUCK.
back
0sorry Pegacorn, i already did
0WOOT
and then everypony came
Would kinda like to know what sort of rules you have in place. So far as warnings and such.
0BJORNFOT'S GAME
Welcome to the funny hour

Look down below, you'll see "RULES' beside ABOUT US

that question gave me cancer
lol
hehe
and also above the chat window
0mfw Spike is not R34 able
0lol
Oh, Hip
Guess what
?
DE didn't show up...again
mfw This gets successful
what a surprise
its metal link all over again
Pretty much
Well
He hasn't emoted all over the main chat yet, but give him time
are the others R34able?
Ah I see, noting ever loaded last time I took a look but that was back at dinki
Please join our next regular BMN show as we will post further recruitment updates there.
If Bjornfot makes it so i'm in there,I WILL FLIP MY SHIT.
every thing has a rule 34
63 as well for that matter
Thank you, see you next BMN
ohai zombies
will do.
/me enters the room
oh hey
ohai Wrek
Well
That's over
ohai Wrek
Why is that image ridiculous
I'm hoping Octavia can knock it out of the park
I meant in game, though, Sumica
I actually find it fun
pretty sure he will
i have high hopes for octavia
0everyone is safe, dont' worry
0it's just a zombie invasion
Hip you forgot to vote :P
so far 1 no
EVERYPONY IS SAFE FROM THE CRAZY VIKING EXCEPT ME.
which was mine :P
just voted a second ago
I hope that it's not a clopgame...
ah there it is
Just voted
what crazy viking?
THE BJORNFORT
ah bj√∂rnfot
nice guy
0lol
lol
that kick
You're swedish too, Wrek ?
inb4 Errypony trolls me about Bjornfort.
If you'll excuse me, I'll be back for Octavia's interview
take you logic somewhere else guy
guilty as charged
sure what do we do about DE?
Misst√§nkte det. :P
We wait
hehe
?
He'll either show up and explain the situation, or, in the worst case, he'll forget
I have around 9days of music
inb4 Dari trolls me
crazy viking gibberish
ok will put no-show behind his tag on the forums
What part of Sweden?
Hmm
And then the very worst case is that he'll emote all over the main chat about being late and how unfair we are
V√§sterbotten, Ume√•
0it's a Geojacket
I never see any bronies here... or well, any obvious bronies. :P
0chest piece that i think absorbs earth
you?
missing 2 interviews, im not inclined to give him a third chance
Stockholm
RobotPinkie: I'm only here to brony up.
neither am I
0oh right, i just remembered the greatest reference in the game
12bbl
0one of the enemies drops a great item
0it's hilarious
Same here
Didn't we give Metal Link a third chance?
I'm only here because of ponies, but then dari started talking about DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGAN and I couldn't help myself...
yes, but that was because he had a legit excuse the first time, and he was a potential hub streamer
What's the item, SilverMane ?
Only things I am knowledgeable about are networks, anime and world of warcraft, most of which don't come up often in here
So I lurk
*shrugs*
Well, DE better have a doctor's note
0you'll see later on RobotPinkie
yes?
Okay :P
0Oh, there's also a key item (literal key) in the tainted grotto you missed
0use the map to find it
0it flashes yellow on the map, like chests
and I like anime and WoW.... or well, used to like WoW, don't have time for it anymore.
Well, that's a no from me, I'll vote on the forum.
hehe 4 noes :P
are those clopping sounds?
Says 5 on the forum
:P
RobotPinkie: I don't have time for it anymore but I raid about 8 hours a week with friends
I'm still around mostly for my guild's sakes
He's out
yes
so go in though the windows
Did we informed razyn yet?
0stop clopping to zombies
Ah okay, yeah I just raided in the end too. It was fun, but people were getting really obnoxious about making demands.
I have not updated his status, just like to be sure
0i get it
0and now i'm sad
this is lulz
UBER lulz
Like I wouldn't mind if I could just raid once a week and that's it, but then you have to find a relaxed enough guild :P
7This looks like pokemon :o
My guild is pretty fun times, I would've quit years ago if it wasn't for them
Yeah, we're that kind of a guild
7A wild Sathi appeared!
HEY!DOES ANYPONY KNOW WHAT THE HELL ROBOTPINKEMENA IS ABOUT?
0the GeoJacket and Key should be gotten now
fffffuuuuuu
0it's easiest for skill grinding, but not necessary
im gone
Wish I could join you guys. Would be fun to raid with a fellow brony.
0from Chapter 1
If you want to raid once a week you're fine, if you want to move on up the ranks, you have to commit to two nights a week
see you HB
im gonna miss the octavia interview probably
0Geojacket is the item the Shaman droppped; have to get it off her body
ill try and get back as soon as i can
0requires you to go back to her
0just don't forget
See ya
Right now school and work take up too much time during the week, though
/me throws a hacksaw at RobotPinkie in an effort to make RobotPinkemena appear.
0i wonder when MirthTinker/ReticentSmolder will get here. last time i wondered like that, they popped up RIGHT before i pressed enter
Kill it with fire?
Oh yeah, I don't blame you at all.
back
Be back later.
later Sumica
0if you hadn't killed him, that is
what'd i miss?
0not much Wrek
I started playing with friends, it became an obssession even after they left, so I found a guild, made other friends in there and that's the story
7lol they were poor
0he fought the World Saviors, killed the Shaman, and is now wandering into sewers
I probably would've been better off NOT playing it for starters but that's just the way things are
7not even cloth?
/me grabs hacksaw with his teeth
0there is a Silver Sword down here
0it makes you UBER Powerful against undead and dark critters
0i advise you do some fighting down here, you will want to start mastering skills and gaining levels
Heya Chime
0oh fuck
0Numb is the most bitch of a affliction you can get
05no I don't?
05Do it again angelcake :3c
/me already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D:
0well, for melee chars
0Silence is a bitch for casters
/me goes looking for his Morrowind CDs
07How come 2 peoplez?
13:3
/me hugg
/me 0can't wait for Skyrim
Morrowind sucks
Trolololo
0Morrowind was a great game. but i can't play it anymore, i'm spoiled
0Oblivion
trolololo
Dash is awesome.
0Motion Potion cures numb
0oh, you see that button next to the trash can?
God, why do you keep saying that. It's OBVIOUS Matt Smith is the greatest thing to bless the universe with his presence
Skyrim looks awesome, though
4You're all a bunch of pansies, I've first played Morrorwind and loved it. Moved on to Oblivion and poured hours into it, and then went back to Morrowind. It's simple, and Morrowind is sooooooo much better
0hit it
0it sorts the current characters inventory
13Pattyrick, there's Espeon for obvious reasons, and Aurora because she seems to own espeons in general :P
Oblivion > Morrowind
With what they've learned from Oblivion and Fallout 3, Skyrim will probably be awesome
U mad Ghosties?
4Not mad at all, but your preference is worse than my preference :)
0Morrowind has a better equipment system, but it just isn't fun for me
0it's more realistic though, on exhaustion and mana usage etc
Oblivion had crap levelling, that's my big problem.
4Morrowind actually didn't have scaling, which is one of Oblivion's worst problems
It was also a bit too simplified
0scaling allowed me to return to dungeons later though, whcih i loved
played some morrowind at a frined, liekd it but never saw it again, got oblivion, poured tons of hours into it. got stuck with other shit
4Also, there was an element of discovery in Morrowind that Oblivion totally lacked
0since i had been EVERYWHERE by level 12
Eh, I can see why you'd enjoy Oblivion more, just not my cup of tea.
0same for morrowind. just depends on your style.
0although I will say i liked how everything had value in morrowind
I want a game that can be punishingly difficult if you go to the wrong place
0sucks that i can't sell everything i steal in oblivion
4Yep
4And Morrowind is that game
DAMNIT WHY WON'T ROBOTPINKEMENA SHOW UP?!
0Demon's Souls is brutal if you screw up
besides, how does that vendor in burma know i stole this silver pitcher in anvil >:O
Oh yeah, I love Demon's Souls...
0can't wait for Dark Souls, in octover
It's not as difficult as people say, though
>MFW I poured hours and hours of my time into Civ5 and don't remember anything that happened in my life from May till July
4I cannot wait for Skyrim though
4So fucking amped for Skyrim
0November is going to be expensive
07ok
0fucking everythign is coming out then
most bosses in Demon's Souls are ridiculously easy once you know what to do
only exception I've found really... Flame Lurker...
0true RobotPinkie, although sometimes the strategy involved requires perfection
07She's one of Northern California's biggest Espeon distributers
wow
0took me around 40 tries to beat the last boss and Flame Lurker
0those fuckers just DONT DIE
haven't finished the game yet :P
the law is so silly sometimes
while on the topic of games, who here have played Dungeon keeper 2?
0the last boss had me in tears
I've played a little bit of it.
7I did
0I played Dungeon Keeper 1 and teh expansion
I went to the brooklyn brewery website and I had to confirm I was of legal drinking age to ENTER THE WEBSITE >.>
4November will be month to spend money on: Skyrim, Saints Row the Third
0Motion Potion cures Numb, dari
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9eGtyqz4gY
I've finished like... everything but two demons, so presumably the final boss is after that
>Modern Warfare 3
Discuss
0RobotPinkie, did you kill the old king? behind locked door in zone 1-1?
0nah
0trololol
4Nah
4No thanks
no idea, you mean after the second dragon, SilverMane ?
0RobotPinkie, there is a key you can get to unlock a door in the 1-1 zone, where the first red knight was
0oh good
Hi all, again
its a neat little time sink
ahhh, no
AllisZero: Hooker of the FPS genre. End of discussion.
I guess there's another demon in world 1, then
0now you can use remove taint
0RobotPinkie, he's non-aggro
0but he will woop your ass if you aren't careful
Hey.
Nittany_Tiger_: Touche
I'll see soon, hopefully, SilverMane
Only getting skyrim adn Deus Ex myself
Welcome Octavia
Great game that's now being pimped out by Activision.
Thanks. :)
Actually that makes surprisingly good sense. You play it for a while, have your fun, but it's not marriage-worthy
only games I'm getting this fall are Splinter Cell Trilogy and Team ICO Collection :P
0Skyrim, Deus Ex, Uncharted 3, MW3, book 4 of the Inheritance Cycle...
10yo
Yeah.
I'm holding off on the rest until they drop in price
0hello waifu
/me is a cheap bastard
Octavia, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
Alright.
as am I
Do you have any questions before we start?
Hurray for E3 sale and being able to pre-order everything at $20 off. :)
Not that I can think of.
It'll take forever for some titles to drop in price.
Yo RBD http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lMa6RX1G-fM/TlD3yPbUPSI/AAAAAAAAK0s/znhn4P6iRzM/s1600/colgatelick_by_colgatefim-d475u5e.png
06xD
/me already belongs to you, silly :3
0Zombie is an affliction on party members, not the same as Zombies
06:3
lololol
How did you hear about us?
0dammit RobotPinkie, that had fallout on others you know
0Antibody is more rare, use that
Hello Octavia
Believe it was EqD a while back.
0takes longer too
Hey Ghosties
fallout on others?
0like me. HHHNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
Haha
I see. How many movienights have you attended so far?
0i love the pointless bridge maze
Hey
and well, it might take 6 months for them to get in my price range, but it'll still be the same games :P
0hey DE
OHGOD ROBOTPINKIE
Ghosties, I am here to say I may be a BIT late...
Don't go to bed!
:p
I have something important I need to get done first.
Think its been at least half a dozen or so.
0where is bjornfot? we need to regale him with praise for his game being mentioned on EQD again
But I WILL be there, it may take 1-15 minutes though.
RobotPinkie, they may infact be better games by the time you get them. :p
Do you have any experience with moderating?
05Espeon
05hi
07awww, I gtg D=
05cya :c
only game I've bought NEW new in the last year is Portal 2
07Goodnight, everybody =D
06gnite pats
and that's because I got a bundle with Orange Box for $50
Accidentally closed the wrong tab :C
In the last year?
Yes. Many forums, some chats. Can't recall if I've moderated on IRC before however. Maybe a long long time ago.
Hmm...
0use that on him
Oh wait, you've only bought one game NEW in the last year?
I buy everything new.
0it's greenish? i think?
well I've bought several games new and shrink wrapped
Wow you've been busy!
I mean close to release
Okay.
4Denied_Existence, PM
Well, I guess I got Sly Trilogy fairly close to release too
What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
But in the past year not sure what all I've bought.
0well, Mardek is a caster for now then
but that was like $30, not the same as getting a NEW game
0oooo the Sly cooper trilogy, not bad
In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
I think Civ5 still falls in the last year.
I wub the Sly games
As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
0i'm waiting for them to remake the original Spyro Trilogy or something
0I don't understand how Insomniac could give up that title
Might not happen
0but at least they gave us Ratchet
Yeah that would be awesome.
The original trilogy were made by Insomniac
0yeah
0we'll never see classic spyro again
oh and I got the Tomb Raider Trilogy for like... $20 or something
I don't see Insomniac giving whatever company owns Spyro the go ahead to remake them, especially if it's Activision
0neither do i, barry
That would be even more true if this new idea flops
0cest' la vie
0or w/e it's spelled
Activision ruins everything. The game is going to flop and the developers fired.
4Dari, correct me if I'm wrong, but, you said this was a flash game?
0it is Ghosties
Hmm, tough question. Well, I think I'm a pretty decent moderator. I'm pretty dutiful. Outside of moderation. Well, I'd like to say I could help with the site. But its also been a good little while since I've done that as well. I'm good with promotion and networking.
0http://fighunter.wikia.com/wiki/Fig_Hunter_Wiki
4So, you can't download it?
0that has all the info on the game, although much of it is spoiler
4How long would you say it is?
Trying to think of anything else.
0Chapter 1: 1-3 hours
Take your time
0Chapter 2: 8-18 hours
Networking, could you explain that?
0Chapter 3: 25-60+ hours
4Jesus
0all made by one guy, music, graphics, engine and all
4I'm impressed, if not wary
0he is highly lauded for his technical skills and creativity
0fighunter.com is his site
Oh, simply networking with people and places.
To anwser your question SilverMane,i have no idea where Bjornfot is.
Nittany_Tiger: And then Activision will sell Spyro to the highest bidder
Any other abilities you like to showcase to us?
0okay Pegacorn
4Something about it being a flash game...
0Barry, i hope someone worth their salt buys it up. Spyro is... one of those titles that needs to be saved
yeah. What about Crash Bandicoot?
0Ghosties, it's good enough that I'd buy the trilogy for full price if it wasn't free already
0I loved Crash Bandicoot. until everything after 3 came out
This site doesn't recognize bandicoot as a real english word
0 10 minute loading screens killed it for me
Besides website stuff, which I would have to rebrush up on, I'm not coming up with anything else that would be of vital use. Not sure if I could host a stream or not. I've not tried it yet.
0really? isn't it an animal?
06aerooooo
06hai
exactly
it is
hi Lighty!
Would you be willing to test your mbps?
but this site doesn't recognize it
Sure. One sec.
Ghosties, give me 10
minutes
anyway, 10 minute loading screens kill anything their in
they're*
Might be slightly slow right now though, my roommate is here and watching Netflix.
brb,gotta do my chores.
That's why Zelda is so loved
no loading screens
one of the reasons, anyway
They've always found some way around them
hi lightly
0oh, that Elwyen char is 14 in chapter 2, but 17 in chapter 3. And she's a total nympho
10 minute loading screens, bad memories of Dragon Age. :/

I'll admit, his Netflix bogs down the network a bit when hes using it. And I'm on DSL
06thank you very much
Most likely.
Walking through sewers, listening to Harmony of a Hunter.

0oh, who was it who loves Red XIII?
Works surprisingly well
I also see Napoleon sometimes
or "Bob", that's a good simple name
can you run a test on speedtest.net when you have the internet all for yourself?

Do you specific ideas do you have any specific ideas to improve Brony Movie Night and help us increase viewership?
bah
sorry
I usually have cable, but DSL was all there was here.
0Xe is an awesome character. I love Xyr
Sorry for what?
As for improving.
Do you have any specific ideas to help us improve Brony Movie Night and help us increase viewership?
0cuz xe is androginous species

I was editing my question and hit enter
Ah, alright.
Have to give part 3 a shot, at least, then
0lol
0it's best if you beat chapters 1 and 2 first, so you can carry over skills and gear
not sure when I'll have time, is my problem :P
I think you're doing pretty good so far. The site could use a little bit of an overhaul. You get a shout out on EqD, so that's really good. The more places you plug, the better of course.
I'm not used to this "Mibbit", but it seems to work well. Kinda wish the video had a pop out window option, but not sure anything could really be done about that.
OK, i am here....
0oh good
0yfw you find Double AP passive skill for first time
hey Denied_Existence
0lol Poor Goblin, opposite of snobbish goblin
Ghosties, I am here now REALLY sorry about that.
I know you have events here and there and that's really cool. I would have suggested that if you didn't already do it. :P
I had some rather bad news
6What ideas do you have for the site overhaul you mention?
0Snee
I'm back.
0you alright DE?
Yeah, family matters, my Step-Grandfather is back in the hospital
0mmm, sorry to hear the Denied_Existance
Could use a bit of sprucing up I think. Snazzy banner, easy and fun layout. All the usual things. Not sure if I could help on that though or not.
6I assume you're looking at the dinkypage site.
I've only got limited experience setting up websites.
Ohai Denied_Existence
yeah, sorry to hear that :(
how is the octavia interview going?
Well enough.
Actually, I'm still on the other one. I forgot the dinkysite page got restored.
I'm pleased so far yes
0Rings of Stat are usually junk. don't bother for the most part unless you REALLY need that stat
ok, cool, anything notable

hey Dari, can you get rid of +N mode?
Since you keep saying it, dari
i gotta go soon, just checking in
thanks dari.

do we need that outside of movie night though?
0Zombies Zombies everywhere, and not a brain to eat
I'm done with followup for the moment, Sathi.
0mfw dat sexy game article
?
ok
moving on
God damn it, why did I have to end up with Action Hank's beard
which article?
about the dating sim
Though they both look the same to me. Is there a big difference in structure I'm missing?
Bjornfot's dating sim?
oh that. *checks EqD*
Yeah
If the writing is good, I'll play the Non-R version
/me puts an extra straightjacket on Insane_Lugia

You are shitting me...
6There's slight asthetic differences in the layout.
0RobotPinkie, it's going to have a date-version and sex-version
0full 34, except for Spike
I'm noticing the buttons at the top are different.
...wow
After octavia DE gets his third and last chance
I guess I should've known
That should be it for today then
OR COURSE!
I've played thru most of Monster Girl Quest
yes
Also, can we move on in the interview or is this necessary :P
I think we're getting off topic
The co.cc page was our fallback during the dinkysite downtime.
FiM dating sim isn't much compared to that, except, of course, the corruption of adorable and lovable characters
Sorry, actually backspaced there.
Tell me: Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
*accidentially
I kinda wish they wouldn't, tbh... but oh well.
no idea GGgala
I thought the image was cute
It's the Colgate pic that's in the article, I believe
probably
He justs didn't want to put that as the story image
*rereads* oh, yeah.
sexy colgate
lol
!fart
LOL!
XD
I know. I was surprised when the dinkypage was suddenly gone. And just to help out primarily. I have a good time here chatting and taking part in the movie nights. Figure why not help out if I'm needed as well?
o.o
It's gonna bring a whole new meaning to "brushie brushie Colgate," I'm sure...

/me runs
so, if you play that game, who are you going to focus on? assuming no harem mode
06try it sooo many times than
I honestly wanted to hear the ideas, and what was being criticized.
Silvermare: presumably there's an adventure plot? explaining your lost memories?
I think that concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
But you guys were just talking about the differences between our two pages
It's good to get the opinions of others.
!fart
Alright.
lolz
PARANOID SPYCHECK!
hmm, would be ineresting GGgala
/me shoots RobotPinkie
Haah
it sure is
If he becomes mod then you may continue the conversation as needed. But we've got another interviewee waiting
For like, two seconds, because that's where it went. But whatevs.
Um... I don't think I will play it. I mean no offence, I just don't think that's a very good thing to even feature on EQD, it's kind of the face of the community.
I think Wrek will have some good idea's aswell
And we've got a half hour before they're starting time, Ghosties.
I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
Actually
true, but the fact that there is the non-34 version is probably why they can even do that
Okay.
More like two hours late
So
That's just me, though, and I don't call the shots. :P
First image:
i'd rather it be word-of-mouth, but at least it's getting out there
...then he can wait.
=P
examine the earwax!
look at it's description
If he can hold us up, we can hold him up.

Doesn't EQD feature adult fanfics too from time to time though?
All I'm saying is that Octavia has been interviewed for more than thirty minutes and we have yet to proceed to the images portion of the test >_>
Nope Allis.
yeah, the extreme shipping compilations occasionally
Hmm, shock value image. Think that would be against the rules.
an interview normally takes around an hour
Gotcha
Not when I do it
:P
at least that the time I calculate :P
in my planning
whenever they compile those stories
I think it avoids clopfics, but I mean there's grimdark and stuff like that.
the dedicated-post stories are still borderline and suggestive only
I like to be swift
PANCAKES.
Plus, its Cupcakes. Which many people are uneasy about.
Second image:
but yeah, the shipping compilations are a slip-past-the-radar
WAFFLES
*pats*
meh, 'Spread Your Wings and Hers' was full blown clopfic and it was in one of the comps
:D

Alright. Well, for the last one, I'd take it down and ask the person to please not post anything against the rules such as gore, shock value images, etc. I never ban first thing. But it would be a verbal warning.
I'll add your follow ups to the interview format
Ah balls, I need to reflash my phone with a new ROM

They're not part of the format?

I won't
I could understand if only one of us was here, but there's always a few of us watching the interview.
At least that's pronounceable, Silvermare :P
DY NO MITE
Annoyong
For the last one, if the chat seemed to be offended by it, I'd take it down. It doesn't go overboard to me, but I know it would make some uncomfortable. Trixie and Twis mom I would probably take down for leaning toward sexualness. First I would do the same as the last for, under shock value.
DY NO MITE
DIE NO MITE
derp
not always.. I did some interviews all by myself :P
it's a Hitchhikers Guide reference, RobotPinkie
and is even funnier when you see who he is
Odd, cut off some of my sentences.
Oh, HAHA.
Who is playing the game?
If you can figure out how to put it in the interview format without it cluttering it up, I'm fine with it. I just really dislike disorganization.
The robot.
XD
Haven't read that in a looooong time
So what are you saying for the final picture?
Not for the last one, second to last one I meant. If it offended, I'd take it down.

If they did it again I would kick. And of course, if they did it, yet again, it would be a ban.
yes exactly

>plot items

You will now think of that whenever you open your inventory
Ah fuck, missed that.
That was the last part of the interview
If only because he's well spoken, punctual, and has plenty of experience modding...or is supposed to have experience modding, that image test was not well reflected on his word
he did it a week ago
uhhh.....
Do you have anything to add?
when he started chapter 1
wtf..?

No
level 10? Wow, slow grind.
You cycle
13and it makes your quit message "brb putting on pants"
06who invented that?!
RobotPinkie, it takes 1000xcurrent level in exp to level up
The initial application as well as the first half of the interview was good.
Not that I can think of. Images can be a tough call, I know that. Since there are varying degrees of what people consider to be "over the line". What offends some might be fine for others. So you simply have to try and figure out if its too much or not. I try and evaluate them as closely as possible though to conclude if theyre over the line or not.
odd....
so it's a taken script
06>.<
The second half of the interview just shows they need to be a bit more strict and work on their IRC knowledge.
It's like /cycle or /hop

how embarassing
Who is in charge of the website?
13pant != pants
That means that's two people having test runs, and a potential third if DE doesn't completely fail the interview
did you see his last comment?
13try naming it trousers, the British alternative ;3
Octavia did do better, that's for sure
Not me, i'm just the local godling
I did.
GOd
I'd say pretty much anything Cupcakes-related is over the line. Most have gore in them. And almost all have a lot of simple shock value. Images not quite sexual, but leaning toward it are especially tricky. But there's a PG13 guideline to follow at least which helps in determinging.
XD
I'm thinking about it.
13Because pants = underwear here

I can believe that.

Ghosties you're here too? and Silvermare? =D

RAMIREZ
Emela can't wear kettle hat, as kettle hat is a half-helm
she can't wear half-helms
CLEAR THE BURGER KING RAMIREZ!
Any UK bronies got Virgin Media TV?
Eeyup
mfw "kettle hat"
and dari is talking about playing cards
Kettle hat is a metal helm that the French used
or so I think.
i do believe
I do, Spazturtle
put her hat back on
Dman, you will be able to get MLP:FIM on channel 730
Spazturtle: FOR FREE?
Welcome, Denied_Existence
/me loves Spazturtle forever
lucky bastages
7Welcome Denied_Existence
and I'd smoke too, Edward, but my lungs can't take it.
We're glad you were able to make it
We've had MLP for ages.
Hey, sorry I was so late...
Since July 4th
but but on boomewang and u gotta pay
I think i'm gonna do exactly what Silvermare told me NOT to do.
We understand the situation
Pretty sure they've shown the entire series already.
i don't get MLP since it's onlyon the Hub over here
MWAHAHAHAHAH
No?
Now, Sathi will interview
I've got Boomerang.
You, that is
...yes? i can't get to it
It is channel 730.

:P
still, watching online
Okie Dokie Loki
We don't have FiM here :(
7Denied_Existence:, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability. Do you have any questions before we start?
/me flyes away Gmod style
ohai Dman

*flies
6The rest of us will interject if we have any questions based on your answers.
No questions.

Yeah I think it'll air on Cartoon Network here
DMan: i'm good, you?

Um...

RAMIREZ!GIGGLE AT THE GHOSTIES!
btw, is my text yellow on your screen too?
7Can you explain that?
I wish FiM were really aimed at grown men...
if you give mardek the silver sword, he can one-shot melee undead as well
once Vehrn masters his skills, of course
I got in about halfway through the first one I cam in on.
came*
no eeveesprit
4Do ho ho, giggle at the ghostie
6Due to what time you found the EQD post?
GGgala: well, i'm a mmmmmbeech who went to the mmmmmmbeach. I spent like 11 hours ... AAT THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH BEE-YATCH
not that it were any different, just aimed at bronies, to give it more legitimacy :P
ok thnx silvermare
lol
No, I was open and I decided to go see it.
4DO HO HO
RobotPinkie, they've written shoutout and references for us
Er...by open I mean I had time to burn
:P it's Ghosties back from the D(oHoHo)ead
Dman: lawl
=]
such as even making Derpy Hooves/Dinky Doo show up in an episode outside of background
Ghosties, the unfunny Ghost
Dman: sounds awesome
4Yeah...no
WAIT DARI
check map once more
Yeah I know, Silvermare
just to be safe
GGgala, believe it! :P it was awesome
go back to prior room, check map once more
Episode 15 :P
6Alright. Just making sure for Public Relations purposes.
4Everything thinks it's soooooo funny to laugh at the ghostie. I understand that Pinkie made it popular, but what about my feelings? Huh? No one ever asked the damn ghost about his feelings
No.
Ok.
02baaaccckkk
02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
02Buut....
I haven't streamed any since then.
/me giggles WITH the ghosties. Dman hugs Ghosties.
02:3c
AWESOME!
if there was no moer loot, go ahead
02Also ANGEL
/me is still flying Gmod style,trying to find a silk neckpiece for Silvermare
Uh, i mean, Bene
02I LEARNED TO DEATHBOMB
RAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZ
02BY REACTING OVER THOSE
lol but it's still not like... socially acceptable
Pretttttty much
020.00000000000000000000000001 secs given
Are we supposed to care about the ghostie?
lol Pegacorn, still RAMIREZing huh
Eeyup
yes, EdwardNewgate :P
come hug him bro
/me hugs Ghosties
13LOL
Why do we bother with Ponychan threads?
RAMIREZ!GIFT ME GMOD!
Oh, that's right... we barely care about them anymore.
RAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZ
4You don't have to care. Just have some modesty, that's all I ask
Ohai everybrony
Haha
02I still can't pull it in an normal basis
RAMIREZ!FUCK EMELA
You sound like my best friend
02but it's close enough
allo'
13Again, you don't HAVE to restrict yourself to just deathbombing in MoF since you can easily regain bombs :P
>mfw I put one up Monday last week, it 404'd on Tuesday, never put a new one up.
Ohai Dermathil
Is giggling WITH, 'stead of at, modesty?
Also, I was spurred to both contact Circuitmane of thebronyshow and come here after I heard you on it, sprinkles.
/me hops, skips and jumps over Ghosties
Sup, bro!
hai dermathil
02Yeah :P
amidoinitrite?
hey Dman!
/me wraps up Ghosties.
she healed it, so her mana takes damage
(keep the puns coming!)
*spuured*
I FOUND IT!
*spurred*
OH LAUD
I got it
/me flies back from the store
lol, totally not meant to pun
Told you guys going on The Brony Show would get us more viewers. =D
RAMIREZ!OPEN THE DOOR!
Blame my being a texan
RAMIREZ! GET ON TEH FLOOR
Dari. Using puns? NO WAI
I wanna go on the brony show... *pouty face*
RAMIREZ!WALK THE DINOSAUR!
MASON, WHAT DOES THE DINOSAUR MEAN?
7What is your availability for moderating?
/me yawns
4>cooler
EdwardNewgate, i meant at ghosties :P
oh
Ghosties. Using puns. NO WAI
If it wasn't for the fact that his show airs tomorrow and there'd be no time for him to prepare a timeslot to ask about our upcoming LotR event, I'd say go ask him.
/me throws the silk neckpiece at Silvermare
Dman, better?
But he probably has all his timeslots filled.
RAMIREZ!CATCH IT!
4I used a pun?
umm
Uh...everyother week I will be able to devote any time after 4 on weekdays and all day on weekends, other weeks my time may be for an hour on weekdays and mabye a few hours on weekends.
thanks?
stream dropped
ask Dman
well, ghosties - giggle at/with ghosteis, hop skip jump ghosties, wrap up ghosties.
I kinda want to get on his show again now that I have an external mic, should I ever get a Monday night off.
Stream dieded for me... what happen?
Which will never happen.
>_<
Dunno
4...?
we made 3 FiM song references to Ghosties >_<
And I should be able to make every movie night unless something comes up.
have some copypasta from 2 minutes ago
Yeah, I went into it Silvermare.
No problem Silvermare
oh good. streams back
/me flies away
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMAAAAAAAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7I see
Dman giggles WITH the ghosties. Dman hugs Ghosties. RobotPinkie hops, skips and jumps over Ghosties Dman wraps up Ghosties. <Dman>: (keep the puns coming!)
/me goes to the Grand Galloping Gala with Ghosties
4Oh, I thought EdwardNewgate was implying that I made a pun
geddit now ghosties / EdwardNewgate ?
Ooohhh
7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
Well...
4I mean
4I made a pun much earlier
4But no one got it
7In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
PEELZ
PEELZ HERE
ya did?
7As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
4Yeah, I did
I GEDDIT... i think
First of all, I am extremely smart. Scored 95% or higher in all categories of my SAT. I am a quick learner.
what, 'giggle at the ghostie'?
Therefore on-the-job learning will be simple.
sooo, what be happenin' 'round here?
(i just got here man i may have missed it...?)
no one can use Polemace yet
4You did miss it
Dermathil, i got here like 2 mins before ya
no idea
4And no one got it
4And so the world turns
>implying on-the-job training isn't always simple
I will be able to answer hard questions and take part in discussions of any sort.
ah, repeat Ghosties i may know it
:P
stream dropped again
mfw I thought that's what Dman was talking about
aww no wai! EdwardNewgate i just got here :P
4I kicked someone (forgot who) and said "How does my boot feel 3 feet up your ass?"
4Then
4He came back
IT WAS ME
Second, I am very well organized, my work has always been thoughtful and good in everying I do
Dman: eeyup. that was in the dating sim news post.
WHY ISN'T THIS MY WALLPAPER
GGgala i c dat :P

It'd be nice to go to. But waaaaaaay too far away for me I'm afraid.
it combines my love for the UK and for ponies...
Yes, >implying I won't be able to.
RobotPinkie has a love for UK?
/me hugs RobotPinkie
Brighton!
Yeah, I has the wingest boner for the UK.

Hrm
Here's a touching story.Once upon a time you died and i lived happily ever after.The End.
Pegacorn: flashbacks? to bronystate chat?
I'm... uh... split on the sim, until I know what exactly it is. :P
Flashbacks to the.....you know.......that thing at the place...
>does gentlecolts.weebly.com male character survey. >realises all his answers rae LOLNO. >leaves website. xD
Pegacorn: ah yesh, the Thing!
I'm going live soon with a new show of mine XD on a different radio station
13Play th13 ~
:p
and there was that one pony...
I meant what happened on the moon.NEVER MENTION IT.
02Not playing th13 before everyother one before :P
02I want to keep the order
02:3
13:3
13th10 then~
02Already beated Easy, Normal makes me cry
so, what you're saying is... What happens on the Moon, stays on the Moon?
Found me some Morrowind, yay!
13Normal is easy for me until I get to stage 4
02reached Extra's boss. yet not lived to see her 2nd spell card
13LOL you cheat
13Shouldn't be playing extra until you beat normal~
02And this is why I haven't beated PCB's extra, lol
4Fuck yeah, Morrowind!
You and your wild lunar vacations. *shakes head*
4*brohoof RobotPinkie*
/me brohoofs Ghosties
WOAH WOAH GGGALA.
/me sits on Angel's head
WHAT DID I TELL YA JUST A MINUTE AGO?
13Just so you know though, Kanako's last spellcard on normal is way easier than its Easy mode counterpart |D
>2 hours from Brihton. :/
Brighton*
Well that's not TOO bad, is it?
It means I'd have to go with my family if I take that car.
Trains, I dunno.
13Also Ray, if you haven't seen it yet http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w337ij3wtXA&list=FLqlKKNJmbMqyhfns7DD8rMg&index=1
Oh...
the*
Pegacorn: what? didn't say anything really!
Your family all knows about your bronyhood?
Eeyup.
YOU IMPLIED SOMETHING GGGALA.
just the location! where stuff happens.
Do they mind, or are they cool?
They're fine with it.
Phew, that's good at least
02WAIT WAIT WAIT
02The revived the project?
02they*
13That's the fanmade anime from this year :P
I think I'll get to a save point then give this game a break for a while.
02Oh, lool
/me hits GGgala over the head with a baseball bat
Fine by me
13I think you're referring to Maikaze, which have announced they're releasing ep 2 this year sometime
02I thought that they revived the old fan made anime series
Those names were getting to me :P
OW! What's that for, Pegacorn?
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
/me 7blinks.
7Fanmade anime. O.o
Well actually,it's because of what you said.
6dari, mod chat?
Names like Fnordheeun Euthrooewjrened Schnweeeeeeeeeeee
Skype?
Or IRC?
4Octavia?
Hmm?
6IRC
4PM
Oh
Pegacorn: Oh, you're still on about >implying implcations? Which I /did not/!
There we are.
LIES
6Ah, there you are.
7Welcome once again
Welcome again
Thnak you.
Alright, listen up
Damn.
Both of you
WB Sky :0
6I'm glad to inform you both that we've decided to hire you both. =D
Internet's derping.
Yes?
We've decided to hire you
YOU TOTALLY IMPLIED.....you know......what happened.
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
Ah, yayy~
6However!
Think my ISP's DNS server exploded or something.
What happened on the moon?
Thank you for this grand opportunity
Yes, however
I will not let you down
You both need a great deal of training
Yeah
WHAT DID I IMPLY BRO. SHOW ME
Firstly
hi Kos!
http://bronystate.co.cc/rules/
hi aero~
6You both need to get a more firm grasp on the rules as far as images and such go.
Did you accidentally a prostitute, Pegacorn?
Read them
Nope.
/me floofs Kosoveon
Yup, I've been reading the rules to get as informed as I can with them.
/me floofs back o3o
Is it something Bjornfort related?
o3o
Yea
13ohai Kosoveon~
6The first image, for example should have been a verbal warning, as it's Cupcakes, which is starting drama.
Except that both of you, for lack of a better word, slipped on the images
The very first Bjornfort event.
6The second image is R34, which is a verbal warning.
ffffffffuuuuuuuu
6The third image is just plain shipping, which is fine.
!Kosoveon
I thought I had said verbal warning for the first.
Last image is where you both really messed up
Since it was Cupcakes.
I did?
Oh, I missed the gore clause.
It's explicit gore and shipping
Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tear up old wounds...
That's instaban
7Last image is instant ban
Ooooh.
:>
Minnet: set my location to Northern Norway.
6The fourth and final, is gore, Cupcakes, shipping, and probably posted to start drama.
Lakorv: Got that.
Understood
6INSTABAN.
Instant ban.
Now listen
Minnet: what is Lakorv's location?
Lakorv: Lakorv's location is Northern Norway.
It's ok.I endured WWII.The "Moon incident" is nothing compared to that.
Dari, need to you add Octavia and DE to the exempts here.
Both hired?
>mfw Bjornfot spelled with two R's
seems good enough to me.. at the moment anyway.
Yes.
You both need to start thinking like mods, not viewers. That's the biggest mistake you made in the interviews. We understand the viewers are a priority, but we have rules and we do not tolerate porn or explicit gore at all
lol
Only 3 votes on forum?
posting DE's interview to the forums and updating status
It's his nickname
Alright.
6If something does come up, we have an appeals channel.
Ok.
He's a fort, apparently.
I'm probably more lenient than I should be.
I thought we waited for at least a majority vote?
Like A Rock?
Me too...
You're both too passive
6However, you will not be given access to the banhammer immediately anyway.
But
wb, Dman
We hope that we can train you
Back, erryone =D
time to ...*gulp* ...read
LIKE A ROCK
thanks, GGgala
Wut is it Dman?
Fair enough.
Yep
ohai Dman
Read what?
Hipster already looked over octavia and denied existence and agreed, as far as I remember
RobotPinkie: you DON'T WANT TO KNOW MAN
And four mods have already given consent
Pegacorn: the silvermane x dman. That's right, si- oh he's gone. still, I haven't ever read it yet
D:
I... don't?
whatwillIfind?
OHSHI-
6First off, pick colors. First come first served.
7Congratulations to both of you and welcome to the team
Blue.
Pegacorn: u read it?
6Which blue?
That's the last blue
Unless someone is already using it.
Huh?
12This one
6There are 3, two are in use.
Hmm.
Okay
....I DISAGREE WITH THE FIRST SENTENCE ALREADY!!!
That'll work.
WHO WROTE THIS?
12This is the only one not in use
6Yeah, the darkest blue is the one not in use.
14Though gray befits Octavia, wouldn't it?
Well I guess it was only a matter of time before you shipped with Silvermane...
Link so i can see this thing?
Yeah, thats what I was thinking...
uh...
RobotPinkie: was done 2 months ago
mfw D: so never read it
Is the Grey easily readable though?
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
lol okay
4The only problem is that it may be hard to make out amongst a sea of whites
Out of 9 who can.
4But only time will tell, it may prove effective
So, before I start up Season 2 of Jackie Chan Adventures, what's everyone up to?
i dun wanna link it till I read it actually...sorry, i'll link in 2 mins or so
Looks readable
4Unless you want to go with blue, it's your choice
2 months ago was YEARS before my time
Not counting Cross really giving consent.
Dave_BroZilla: *brohoof* Love that show!
Stands out enough to me.
Since he's brand spanking new.
SO good
I think the blue is much more easy to pick out.
ohey Dave_BroZilla
Jackie Chan Adventures FTW
4Then go with blue
6It looks fine to me.
Finished season 1 last night...partially the reason why I couldn't make the stream
A YA! (uncle)
Right
lighty
6But it's your call.
you are evil
One more thing...
seriously
The Gray you mean Sprinkles?
XD
*smack*
06xDDDD
6The gray I mean.
14Lets see...
12And this one...
6Just know that some people complain about the darker colors, like blue.
Looks fine.
hey, I fell for it too :P
brb,gotta eat
4Blue, gray, your call. But you do run the chance that you may need to change it if people aren't noticing you in the main chat
hahahaaaa.........haha.....ha.....crap. i now gotta rewatch them. haven' seen literally since they were aired....greeeaaaat, something else to watch :P
bai bai Pegacorn
Apparently the episodes are on YouTube
So...
peace, Pegacorn
14I'll stick with gray then.
6Gray's dark enough that it's seeable.
lemme find 'em
What happens when we run out of colours?
hey guys, i gotta disconnect.
4Alright
03hm
: /
4And DE?
GIANT-ASS STORM STARTING
WE INVENT MORE
We probably won't before we split rooms.
03I'm kinda going :/ at the concept of using a Ponyta as my new Dream World slave
losing internet
Uh...Either Green or Blue
We still have a few more.
03just because EW MLP
03but eh
Lol, it just finished in Toronto
Or, create a palette wheel for our domain
Simple
3Hows this?
6Looks fine.
"Dman entered panic mode. He hoped no one would ever discover his secret... especially not SilverMane, the coolest and most handsome pony he knew." WAT WAT WATWATWATWATWATWATWATWATv
Oh yeah, not sure if we told anyone, but DCD and I were talking about that.
WAT
4Looks good
6Better than the blue.
...
3Oh good.
6The blue blurs...
4I do believe
4That's all the colors
3Greenery it is then
14Yeah, I noticed that about the blue too.
6All righty then.
3YOU MUST BRING ME A SHRUBBARY
He's onto you!
/me falls over. he drags himself back up, hands on the desk, eyes barely peering over it into the screen.
NOPE
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
We decided we should have a room with everyone which is throttled so limits the number of messages as well as split rooms with unlimited messages.
I was asking you to try doing something like that anyway...
About the domain, or colors?
02ANGEL
"Standing up, he could get a proper look of Dman's "speical outfit". It was completely black leather, darker than the void, yet shining brilliantly in the moonlight coming in from the window. There was no doubt about it - Dman looked totally stunning." D: D: D: D: D:
/me faints
Also, anyone want me to PM them the first episode of JCA?
03so, sigh
02THISISEPIC
13?
Who...who...who wrote this...
03the city is shutting our water off tomorrow
...I don't understand
13Oh, I know right :D
Dave_BroZilla: please, bro
Dave_BroZilla: what's that stand for?
Like a link?
You have them added to the exceptions, dari?
4Now
Jackie Chan Adventures
03they're like "We're installing some fire hydrants in your neighborhood so live without water for a day"
Not yet.
ohh
02best use of 16 minutes.
GGgala: jackie ch-aww ,ninja'd
youtube
4I think we should move on to a more private place so we may discuss your new positions
3It looks like a mosaic in here with all the colors now.
ohhh, yesplz
i can't find the first one
/me 7reveals herself out of the shadows a moment
So 1 room with everyone + say 1 minute between each message you can send, then the rooms with a 300 person limit or whatever, but not restriction on how much you can talk (until they hit the spam filter :P).
3Sure, where is more private then here?
6As soon as dari does his job... >>;
(i don't normally say this but) WHAT THE FUCK
We thought it'd give the best of both worlds.
You should right away, because we should invite them in here to talk without prying eyes
7Dman no new house eps yet
:P
*gasp* Sathi!
7there will be this week
14lol
...why are BOTH silvermane and FRIGGIN RAINBRODASH trying to get it on with me in this clopfic who wrote this?
!fart
Sathi: awesome! can't wait for it, don't worry about it
Sathi, want a link to the first episode of Jackie Chan Adventures?
Only 1 minute posting limit?
Does that go for mods too?
03EW
LOL
7Got s1 + s2 ready to go
03that script is disgusting
you actually did it aero XD
>prying eyes
Boss
>you can see when people join :P
excellent, thank you so much Sathi
Torrent is taking forever for S2 and up to dl for me, lol
But they can't see the room itself
I dunno, depends.
: /
Srsly, been like 4 days now
7I own all dvd's
7just needed to rip them
02WHY PEOPLE IS SO EVIL
03OK so
Don't the DVD's have scenes cut though?
02I NEED MOAR OF THIS
03for those people who think all rap is just a bunch of inapropriate stuff
03you should listen to this song
That's what I read from some of the Amazon reviews
03I've been looping it lately
I have TV rips
/me 4wouldn't mind if Sathi streamed more House today
6Alrighty, just join #bronystatemods
/me 4likes House
03it's about girls who get abused by their (step)parents and run away to deal with it
03:/
7Maybe I will
Need to add them to the acces list though.
Me too.
4Simple, we know

access*
3It kicked me
WAY TO NOT SET FLAGS
XD
14Me too :P
7who wrote what..?
*claps* good job
RainBroDash was NOT happy. "WHAT THE HAY ARE YOU DOIN' WITH MY BITCH, DMAN?" RainbroDash walked up to the earth pony. "WHAT THE HAY, MAN! GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON NOT TO KILL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW!" Dman was too petrified to answer, so RainBroDash started beating the manure out of him. When he was finished, Dman was nothing more than an unrecognizable mushy
pile on the floor. He then slapped SilverMane's horrified, bloodstained face. "We're going home. NOW. And you're getting TRIPLE assrape tonight!" The End.
6Sorry, dari didn't change the flags yet.
Dman clopfics
3DAMMIT DARI
6Just the exemptions.
That, sathi. Someone apparently months ago wrote a fic with me in...wat

They need to register, don't they?
Your fault bro.

14Hah
6You guys need to register your nicks.

6I'm just telling you for future use.
I usually get out earlier than most people in school or college, my county does that for some reason
OH that's right, no dari
RobotPinkie: Clearly nopony.
13I do have a problem with it bypassing the swear filter though
13could you at least change that?
3Ah, ok
6You should be able to join the channel now.
03^
And so I return to college before everyone else does
Has not been shipped with SilverMane.
oh there you are :P
6Wait, no.
I am the only one not to have been shipped by Silvermane.
Lawl.
dari, I think they're registered
Ok.
3You need to unban our IP's I suppose
03and really, any scripts that put random people's nicknames in them are grounds for being abused - at least make it use the name of the person who triggered it...
MWAHAHAHAHA
I love being shipped by Silvermane
Was it THAT good, Dman?
even if my waifu doesn't
Octavia still isn't...
3I gotta go in a minute or two
I'm not shipped with anybody...foreverabrony.jpg

Yeah.

Dave_BroZilla, you so lucky
06i thought we'd STOP ranting

I haven't been shipped either, whoo!

GGgala: nope, but Dman did
a wide lens , in photography anyway, captures a broad viewing angle for the camera. It's good for landscape and urban shots but also close ups as it can produce humorous distortion effects
/me 7dances all around the modroom
/me 14dances too
14Yay, it worked.
I guess Dmann doesn't want to hear RainBro's name after the.....thing from earlier.
14I havent done a /me in years.
03LOL
03I know that much
lolwut
0I wish there was an Alestorm PMB
Now
14Yes, I know. like I said, its been a while since IRC.

Do you remember any IRC commands?

6That kind of talk will earn you a swift kick.
I'm all for mods using mIRC (or another proper client) instead of mibbit by the way. :P
14Though I seen to have more options when I use mIRC than this.
6Not because of what Pony, but because any "this pony sucks" isn't tolerated.
It's...A Map
0ON EqD NOW BRB
14Yeah, I got on here on mIRC last night to check it out.
7Dari
oh I need that map
For now, just use the IRC stuff
7if you help me use colours
7I will switch
6"so and so is best pony" is okay, however.

/me is just fine using IRC
Mibbit != IRC

is that acceptable?
Mibbit == IRC client
:P
mIRC == IRC client
14I've never used "Mibbit" before here.
WUBUBUBUBU
Nope. Kick time.
Well, mibbit is using the term client loosely.
6As long as you're keeping things positive.
FFFFFFFUUUUUU-
6Negativity starts mudfests.
14I've only used mIRC in the past.
Mibbit's a web application, IE crap.
So and So Pony is Best pony, but This Pony Sucks just flat out sucks as a pony
6We dislike mudfests.
...lolwut. saying ana imaginary pony sucks is against the rules?
/me 7is preparing to stream in a bit
It's the best web client though.

10also robotpinkie <3
He can
10Then direct him my way? O.o
0Oh, what do you know, that is RainBroDash's colour
6inb4 Dman emotes everywhere
6Again
10.. eh?
10:3

6I don't get my stuff wrong, Dave.
It's always been his colour...
Don't start this again
0Well, blue is blue
0Red > Blue
0just saiyan
4God, I hope he doesn't
lol
10Sprinkles has defended my honour in my absence. I thank thee.

There, now it's done
0lulz script
hi J
0brb anyways, dinrar
10kk dave :)
hi again xD
6It was just said he wants to talk to RBD
4He's not in chat
6He was a moment ago.
6He just left.
4Oh dear
4WELP
10also, Dman had something to ask, you say?
4I guess RBD may have to do it himself
yes
You still stuck with the horrible screaching mic Sprinkles?
4Unless he begins emoting more and more
6I am not.
Hell yeah, $40.
Thought so.
Seriously, stop this shit about Dman now. :/
Something happened to Dman.
J~
6If he emotes, our new rules are up, and RBD can point Dman at myself, you, or Hipster, Ghosties.
hi
hi Kos!
yeah. he looks like he lost his internet
4True...but Dman never comes to us
4Ever
This one is awesome.
4In particular because him and RBD are in a skype group together
6I know.
4So I guess he feels he can escape the ire of the senior mods?
6If he keeps emoting to RBD when the rules specifically say who to go to for complaints, I'll drop a temp ban on him.
6I'm not even kidding.
6It's annoying.
4Yes it is
aboot
French verse is best verse.
6And it's disobeying the mods, which is clearly against the rules.
4True, it is
mfw Braeburn is canadian, he's WAY too sexy to be canadian
4Especially since he's talking about CB to RBD and emoting about it
He hasn't done anything right now.
J'vais dire une phrase en francais parce's'kicit on es blingue.THERE I SAID IT.I'M BLINGUAL.
6He's going to emote about Octavia and DE getting hired.
So STFU guys, you're the ones just spreading shit right now without even addressing HIM about your worries.
Seems hypocritical to me.
4u mad?
dat Gilda
6I can't address him.
6He's not online.
6Or else I would.
4And, again, he's going behind our backs
4When he should be addressing his concerns to us
dat Rarity
He doesn't HAVE to talk to you.
6I didn't even realize he was online until he was just online.
dat Twilight
Gilda moustache is best moustache
4His concerns are our concerns, especially when it concerns mods
dat Scootaloo
dat foreshadowing
6If it concerns who we hire as opposed to him, it kinda is.
dat Morrowind done installing
Seeya in hell Scootaloo.
DAT IZ A LOT OF BEE
dat Spike
We already decided that we're not hiring him, so why do you keep throwing shit at him, where he can't see it, the way you said he shouldn't do.
dat Celestia
DUDUN
4Oh
4trust me
VAGINA
4I'll tell him
You guys are doing exactly what you said he did.
4When he actually confronts us
6I'm not throwing shit at him.
I WANT MY REQUEST PLZ.
6I'm honestly waiting for him to be online to ask what the issue was in the first place. >>;
4Also
BITCHY
6Repeatedly asking for your request is only going to make me not want to play it...
Ohai Daxton
Ok
I just don't want this discussed any more, it's all irrelevant now, he's not going to be a mod, so why do you keep talking about it?
4We really need to all talk to him when we tell him we're not giving him a trial. I want to be as prepared as possible for a potential drama storm and/or ban
/me 7wants to ninja the stream
6I've stated this many, many times.
It's just i'm impatient.
4Because we haven't actually told him yet
6I'll hand it over after this vid, Sathi.
So?
7sure i'll start setting up
4Um...we're planning?
Best part of my day
What is there to plan?
10As long as it's not dari streaming
Doing heroic Ryolith in Firelands and spamming YAY on our vent channel
10I'm ok with this
4To tell him that he's not getting the position
>streamed this video yesterday
10AllisZero. You're a hero
:P
7did you record it?
4It's not so simple as saying "you're not getting it because of such and such"
Well I already know what I want to say.
4It concerns RBD who pretty much ratted on him
And would have told him.
4It also concerns CB, who he bitched about
I wonder where Dman went.
4Look
4We can all tell him exactly what we think, I don't care, but he needs to be told
It's late where Dman is... and here too.
This conversation didn't start about telling him he's not getting mod.
ohey again AllisZero
It started with you two bitching about him. :/
6As long as it's done in a professional manner.
6And I wasn't bitching. I was saying that he was going to complain to RBD.
6...which he was.
You guys keep talking about professionalism, from where I'm standing, I'm not seeing much of it.
4I'm astounded that you see absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that Dman clearly went out of his way to not voice his concerns to the mods he's supposed to voice his concerns to
7implying it's not late here?
Ghosties, I don't want to have this conversation again, you already know what I think and why.
4Your obtuseness quite honestly blinds me
I wanted to tell to RainBro what Dman wanted to know,but i don't remember exactly.
Hi
lol where are you again, Sathi?
FIRE EVERYWHERE OH MY GOD
7netherlands
Oh that's right, you're in the GMT zone
<3 The Netherlands
I'm half dutch, so...
7i'm half dutch too
Hopefully you inherited the best parts of both countries :P
7hihi well said
0I'M BACH
7alright i'm setting up now
0So, what PMVs did I miss?
6All of them.

How do I socks?
0I WAS TRYING TO AVOID THAT STAGE OF BRONYDOM
0I CAN'T GO BACK NOW
0OH GOD
It's too late now!
6>implying you can avoid any stage of bronydom
/me laughs maniacally
0*curls into fetal position and weeps*
Great idea
DAMN YOU ROBOTPINKIE!
On a boss where doing damage to his legs
nyoro~n :3
And trying to keep stuff that's following him to hit him...
DO DAMAGE TO ONE LEG AND MAKE HIM SPIN LIKE A BALLERINA
0And I'm going to attack his weak point for massive damage...
Massive, massive damage?
Also
Someone who swore to hate FIM Forever
0Massive, massive damage
Has just been turned into a Brony
0GREAT SUCCESS
Oh man... I loved that so much in Viva Pi√±ata...
So it holds true, you can't avoid any stage of bronydom, ever
"So DJ P0N-3 is kinda awesome..."
What stage can't we avoid?
The hatred stage?
I skipped that part...
EXPLOSION
I was neutral towards it
Before watching it.
Godspeed you magnificent bastard!
Some people though, oh boy, anything that can put a dent on their self-made idea of masculinity...
0I figured it was a fad when I saw all those pony threads on 4chan
0what turned me over was an edited entry on a wikia that got screencapped on Memebase AfterDark
There was initial confusion, then "eh, I got nothing better to do right now", then OMFG WHY WUB WOO SO MUCH PONIES
0That whole "PINKIE PIE IS A MOTHER FUCKER. YOU AIN'T NEVER EXPERIENCE A HIGH LIKE FRIENDSHIP"
0That thing
Haven't seen that.
0And I figured, oh, what can it hurt.
This is what i said:http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c8/Soldier_HatOverHeartTaunt05.wav
0I'll try and find the link real quick
It works.

0This one
6I'll brb
6getting some food
0And from there, went through all the epis up till 24, got excited for Party of one which was two days from then
:D
0And found EqD after it hit the 5 or 6 million mark
Haha
0HOW HARD CAN THIS BITCH PARTY? HARDER THAN ANDREW WK ON FUCKING CRACK, THAT'S HOW HARD.
This is true.
I think I'm coming into the fandom at a good time
03LOL, I have never seen an ATM that was out of cash
03I had to drive to a different aTM
03*ATM
Godspeed you magnificent bastard.
Not too late that I miss the wait for sweet season 2
0I second Pegacorn

Pinkie Pie fucking INVENTED parties after seeing a sonic rainboom
/me watches Inspector Gadget on Cartoon Network
that's how awesome Pinkie is
03>A Disney movie that's on CN rather than Disney Channel
And not too early that the season 2 wait is painful
0I SEE YOUR TROLLING BULLSHIT, IT'S GOT NOTHING ON THIS GIRL'S PRANKS
Hey ReticentSmolder
'sup ReticentSmolder
I am here, and thus I am
But again I've been waiting patiently for more Full metal Panic since 2005
You finish Zero Mission yet?
yes
I beat it in 4:13:04
Heh.
0Are you error?
How do you shot web?
0EXISTENTIALISM: Perhaps we are all error.
My hard mode save from right before the last boss is at 3:40
yeah, but that's first run time
SQUEE
Yeah, I think my first one was around 4:30 or so.
0After seeing a GoNintendo user avatar, I just made the connection Zero Mission --> Metroid
Dave_Brozilla, you did it wrong
yes
I kinda overwrote it so I dunno what it was anymore.
0How so?
0also, sup Barry
Zero is a remake of the first Metroid
Ow

It's supposed to be I call your trolling, and raise you whatever
BTW,i was quoting the Soldier's thoughts on Bill from L4D.

oh
03back in stock :)
I'm in the 460 win bracket elo...it sucks
6btw Octavia, that's kinda something you'll have to do in mod chat during streams, since we need to know who all is... actually here.
FFFFFF Morrowind isn't working for me...
sometimes it'll be me, a 300, and 3 100 wins against a team of 500+...just cuz the queue like to fuck with me
0Eyup...I'mma go watch Jackie Chan Adventures
lol
I'm on the boat, but I can't talk to anyone and can't move. Just look around.
I might play SH2
Jack chan adventure is pretty boss
SH2?
0So true
But house is bawserer
Silent hill 2
as in Silent Hill 2?
yay! Awesome game, that.
yes
0But House doesn't have a catchy theme song by Wheatus
I've never played it
Looking forward to the HD collection this fall.
0inb4SilentPonyville
MIGHT buy it if it's cheap enough.
just read its ending ^
0There's an HD collection coming?
EXPLOSION
Yep, Silent Hill and MGS are both getting HD updates on 360 and PS3
0Only one I've played is Shattered Memories on Wii...and I honestly can't get past the first encounter with the face-huggers.
14Do what exactly?
0Hum, might be a worthwhile investment
MGS will have 2 and 3, same with Silent Hill.
Since SH4 wasn't really a Silent Hill game.
0Wait, isn't the 3DS MGS a remake of MGS3?
Hm
Well, yeah, I think so.
6Saying you're going afk or whatever.
everything is a remake of everything nowadays
0Indeed
0nothing original
I like HD updates
I play it for the plot
0It's merely how you combine old concepts into something not done before
6Of course do so in mod chat, we don't like to have the chat know when we're short a mod.
at least when it's games I love already.
14Oh, okay. I will.
03hn
03*hm
03just called Office Depot, they said they are going to send me the two tablets I bought XD
I dunno, some new things come out, it's just not as frequent as in the 80's and 90's
0StarFox Adventures Dinosaur Planet and F-Zero GX would be balling to have HD on console
0rather than through Project Dolphin
14Do I just -need- to be here during the movie nights, or you want me here as much as I can?
Minecraft is pretty revolutionary...
Minecraft is great
14I'm guessing whenever I can.
6Basically if you can't make it say so.
I want an HD update of another Rare game....
14Okay.
YES!
0But Minecraft was based on another game the creator thought had so much potential
0so even it can't claim full originality
14I know the BMN's I need to be.
NEW F-ZERO! SO MUCH WANT!
super awesome bonus props to anyone that can guess which one :P
14I just meant the slow times.
4Just come in some times
0Rare, eh?
Banho?
14Alright.
4Make an appearance and interact with the regulars
0Perfect Dark?
6Yeah, just stop in every now and then.
Bajo?
Banjo?
0GoldenEye?
14I'm usually multitasking a ton, but will do.
4That way, they'll identify you as a good mod
0Donkey Kong Country from the SNES?
14True enough.
Only too me three tries to not screw it up...
6Like, I stop in, and usually just lurk.
it starts with "Jet"
4Right
6I'll do something else, but I'm still in the chat.
14Yeah, I lurk a bit of the time.
Hey everypony, i'm back!
yup!
4And usually we're met with hellos by the locals
0Thank you
6>usuall
6*usually
4Rare made good games once upon a time
6Try always
0had a massive brain fart just then, lol
That would be... so orgasmic if they made an HD version
0Before they got sold to M$
4Hah, yeah, true XD
SilverMane!You're back!I need anwsers!
What's on the stream?
0Well, all the good devs left before then
6There is ALWAYS somepony here.
...oh, okay Pegacorn
I still like Rare
0but at least we would've had Banjo Kazooie and Tooie on the Wii VC like it was meant to be
4Didn't use to be though, remember?
We listnening to something?
Viva Pinata is awesome
0And Perfect Dark
0and GoldenEye
listening*
4It used to be just me, Sprinks and dari
4In the off hours
6Not like the good ol' days when it was me, you and dari up until 2 AM and then just dari the rest of the week.
Ahaha
That was fun. XD
4Haha, right
0and everything else that wasn't 1st party Nintendo
4God, I miss those days
Trying to fix sound I think, Dari.

13Oh my god seriously
6XDDDDDDDDDD
Dman has encountered something recently.A fic where he was totally out of character,and you and RainBroDash were trying to get it on with him.HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHO THE HELL MADE THIS SO HE CAN SLAP THEIR SHIT.
i can tell from the medical jargon and seeing quite a few episodes in my time
13I'd love to be given that much money for a question like that LOL
4I like Hipster...but no thanks
We're reminiscing already.
lol
Pegacorn... me, RBD, and Dman?
4There's nothing wrong with reminiscing
0And after he slaps their shit
let me check my files, see if i have it
6We're on week... 16?
0I want to give said person a high five
I see no House?
I know, but BMN isn't exactly old yet. XD
6That's FOUR MONTHS.
4I truly do long for the days when there was no one here during the off hours
SilverMane: technically, no. it was you and Dman. RainBroDash was jealous.
violently jealous.
Oh, what's going to stream, lol
ah...
sup SilverMane?
hey smolder
6In internet terms that's FOREVER.
03LOL
03EW RECORDING HE TV
03*THE
4Pretty much lol
4Haha, just think about after Season 2 is done
6Like, Ponies has only existed 10 months.
4Then we will be mainstream
0DAMMIT, GONINTENDO
0UPDATE WITH NEWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSS
6We'll be... the mane stream.
6*shot*
03but I totally want to record that episode now
/me 4doesn't actually use ponyisms
Ih nice
/me 4is too cool for that
03well
03I'm facing a dilemma here
What happened? xD
4I'm too Gilda XD
10PEGACRON sorry was afk
03I can save a little bit of money by cancelling my Office Depot order and buying them from Amazon instead, since no sales tax
6I use them only because I'm used to autotyping to whatever filters filter to.
0Also, who's psyched for Senran Kagura on 3DS?

14I guess I kinda screwed it up too. lol
I'm not sure either, but Amazon might run out again
03I can't actually hear it because it's another one of those stupid video camera recordings
03but that's hilarious
4Well, now you did >.<
14Haha.
14You're welcome. ;)
03so you think I should just keep my Office Depot order?
4Meh
I wonder what custom gala dresses would go for...
10silvermane I may have written it down
LOL

14Its more likely than you think?
I mean, you could save 318$ if you cancel and Amazon runs out
Brushie brushie
14Hah
6...also, Octavia uses the ;) emote a lot just like Sathi. XD
03LOL
03but then I wouldn't get any tablets
14Oops.

did you fight any Warrior Undead, big mini-boss fuckers?
No.
03but yeah, I think I'll tell LL to buy one through Amazon
03since her tablet is kinda garbage
alrighty. you'll be able to beat the game with 4 hours more effort, 6 if you go for secret boss and the tournament

03on the t'hird one, the video quality is so bad you can't even see options C and D :/
Trying to figure out if it's worth making more than one set of gala dresses...
7HOUSE is coming
7just sound derps fixing
RobotPinkie, if you custom-fit them with a plushie designer, you can work together to sell for over 150 on ebay
Sewing machine arrives on Friday, probably, which is good.
after all, a custom Fluttershy plushie was at $85 with 6 days left at auction
6The lupis is affecting the sound.
14Think its near $200 now. Last time I checked anyway.
I like detail, though, Silvermane. I'm just thinking it might be too much work.
well, if you make it once, you should be able to duplicate with less effort, correct?
14A plushie? Yeah. You should have a pattern to follow to make more.
Yeah, that's very much correct.
What are you guys going to do when you run out of colours for all the mods?
well, it's an investment of many resources, but the question really isn't if it's worthwhile, but if you can simply afford the time expense
6Also, I ran into a friend of mine I haven't seen for like, a year, in the bathroom. He starts talking to me. My only reaction "No talking in the restroom. Man Law, dude." and waited for him outside.
lol
SirSprinkles, best way to remember a friend ever
14Haha
6That just happened earlier.
14Thats how I am in the restroom too.
6Like a half hour ago.
cool shit bro
6I ran into my uncle a week ago.
6We both just looked at eachother and met up outside.
Octavia the plushie was taken down from ebay
14Really?
why was it taken down?
Copyright or somesuch
6Plagiarism
14Ahh.
was sold on another website for 300$
14Sad.
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
14lol
14Wow.
6Pony stuff is really being cracked down on, sadly.
what? really? that's kinda... crap, but I understand it. they should have argued right of parody
14It never ceases to amaze me how much some of these things go for.
might ahve saved it
Hasbro really needs to notice just how big of a demand there is amongst us bronies
14A custom NMM made from a Celestia I was eying went for $202 on Ebay.
14Well, the problem with mass-produced toys is the cost to make them. They need to be certain they will sell so many.
(I'm back)
14And the really high quality stuff is a bit more than Hasbro is willing to spend to make toys.
they don't really NEED toys, they need collectibles and stuffed variations, as well as shirts
14Fan toys are usually highest quality stuff.
hey Pegacorn, Silver said you wanted to give me suggestions :P
hi, octavia
Phai MirthTinker.
Molded hair is best hair.
14Hi Barry
*Ohai
14Indeed, I like molded hair myself too.
Octavia are you a new mod?
14I think most Bronies agree on that. ;)

14I dont mind the brushables.,

Brushables only works when they do the hair RIGHT in the first place
Sathi, I'm reminded of Hoity-Toity when you said Take II
Dash's hair doesn't look right with brushables.

So does a lot of things.
!pokemon
Yeah, but pot is best
12the last one
but most other things will reduce your cognitive abilities
12WASN'T the fishing one
Enough pain will reduce cognitive abilities as well
12I remembered

12as I have just about all 36 locations memorized *cough*
i'm not going to discuss this, as i'm an angry person with regards to drugs. so i'll exuent for the moment

<SirSprinkles> 6After RotK on Sunday, Party of One and Sonic Rainboom
12Back
6Cool, thanks.
12Hi
Is he in withdrawal, or just a lot of pain?
6Will update the Home page on dinkypage shortly.
Can't he be in both?
Ok then.
^
I guess
he's an addict to a powerful painkiller, and he has extreme nerve pain due to cellular death in his leg
Right, but it seems more like he's in a fuckload of pain than withdrawal
SAY WHAT AGAIN
he is in a fuckload of pain, and his reactions and bitter responses are due to withdrawal, as is the sweats and exhaustion
!lag

12XD
okay then XD

XD
12simple solution for wanting to do the PMD RP
princess-dari that is
well, how about we go for tomorow?

Wow, what a dick
I'll check your point.
Also, is the home page unchanged for anyone else?
yes
The new site's home page is unchanged.
14You're checking the dinkypage, right?
murr ;3
I didn't want to make Sprinkles feel like he failed, so I didn't tell him
I mean, yawn
14Looks fine to me.
Is unfavorite even a word?
obviously not
S2E1 summary sounds awesome.
FreezeFrame: wut

*you. *is
Ugh, gotta do a ton of packing tomorrow.
dari... you remember shadows can touch the door too right?
oh, nvm
I hate moving, especially when it's to something as temporary as a dorm.
/me never made it past this next level
it takes a while, but it's the final level
/me wishes he could afford an apartment near his college instead, but will have to move in and out of dorms.

14lol
just search it on Kongregate
did you beat either?
SilverMane: Kongregate vs. Newgrounds. who wins?
Play that game.
Kongregate for games, newgrounds for artists and new game developers
Newgrounds, they have Harry Partridge
12paradox @~@
if you played teh first one, go second
I miss Addicting Games when it wasn't owned by Nick.
otherwise, first is good for learning
oh, nvm then
hmmm
Hmmm.. debating buying the whole season of FiM on iTunes for 50 (HD)
what game to advise
50bucks for the whole first season?
In HD
A flash game with an ESRB rating?
It's 40 in SD
Not bad.
dari, you ever played endeavor?
I heard bad things about the itunes version
Not sure.
Maybe.
I've got the HD itunes version.
720p
Torrented though.
it's this: http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/555072
I'll wait for the DVDs.
The first episode is free on iTunes
now you're thinking with portals~
endeavor?
/me shot
OH ENDEAVOR
it was amazing
endeavor is a great artistic game; it's on Kongregate as well
SilverMane: i love it too. not sure i'd call it artistic though?
nope, not bullet spam
Bullet Hell?
the story makes it artistic
12Kosoveon has a portal obsession
games with moral-like stories typically get classified as artistic
we not playing Last Stand then?
no fox
dwarf
SilverMane: ah, i see what you mean then
Welcome my son. Welcome to the machiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.
then who put the chest there?

For less complex things no.
"What sport?"
"World of Warcraft."

What did you do?
/me sobs
lol
finished the summary for one of my summer books.
Summer books? What is this thing you speak of?
Which I take the test for in a few hours.
My school, as part of the literature class, assigns us some books to read over the summer.
Which I waited until today(the day before school) to start.
Of course.
Naturally. Anyway, I read one because was easy.
woo! congrats, Polarfire
But the other one, I read about 5 pages of and.....
I was like 'fuck this'.
I don't think I've ever been assigned work over the summer.
!lag
1 series of chapter summarys later, and here I am.
>:
12XD
Thanks GG!
how ironic.
!lag

yeah i did quite a few fangirl squeals when i read it
oh wow nice drawing!
ty :D
it's almost perfect. the neck could be a little longer, and the head a little farther forward, if a buff pony is what you were after. other than that, it's really well done. I like the fur near the hooves :3
ALSO
so many fanfics with 'element sof discord' or 'discord' or some ohter mention of 'Discord', and then season 2 has Discord. =D
>reads more
^^
>CONFIRMED FOR 2 PARTER =D=D=D
MFW the whole first episode plot got leaked.

since i enjoyed that fick quite allot
haven't read it...should I?
yes
yes
loool
Well, I'd say no.
ok
...yes
Willpower!
But.
I read it.
I don't have enough willpower.
XD
hehe
but yeah was bored, based the poneh on the few descriptiosn in there
...same
that was the results
ok time to read the leak
HOLY CRAP
everything is so GOOD
(but don't wanna say here cuz of spoilers) BUT WOW
good then i has stuff to look forward to
u not read leak?
ill probably be hiding in a cave playing Deus Ex 24/7 >.>
lol
i resisted spoiling it
becasue ill get *mindblown* when i actually see it
ah. well, you know it's a 2 parter, and the 'leak' only leaks SOME of part 1. hmm, still, it's good you didn't read it.
You Betcha! My mind is all over the walls right now.
And now for something completly different
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV0lbMWbfkY
lol
as soon as it begun to loop, i just dragged the bar ahead. : >
ah well time to get back to work
work? orsleep?
need to setup and animate an intro clip
got about half done
oh?
I'd show you but then id have to kill you
orly? what's it for?
^

also, got the fic you wanted me to read opened up. imma shower and b-fast, then read :3
:D
It...will...wrek? intro clip to .... bronystate? fan made intro clip to some fanfic / FiM PMV?
your guess is as good as mine
and yet, your guess would be right on the money. You're the one doing it >_<
Eeyup.
...
um, whoops
Just read my name. It should say Dman >_<. Yea, Daz = Dman btw
and u tired yet, then, dari?
Nope.
what you up to right now?
Watching regular ordinary Swedish meal time.
Okies
>SUDDENLY chat lives again
BRB
Sup GGgala_
ohay again Wrek, sorry for leaving ya hanging there. had to brb
heya Daz
/me reads up
oh, hi Dman XD
Heh heh =] good
actually, i've been thinking to change to Daz, as that's actually my name, and I like it, but never did. I only did so just now by accident while wiping tears and 'sleepy dust' off my tired eyes :P
oh lol, morning then
GGgala_: Did Sathi stream any House last night?
DMAN
EEYUP
she did
Hey Apokalipse. and GGgala_ - :( :( :(
hai
I missed it while was out then i guess
how are ya Apokalipse
streamed the one with the baseball player, and the one where House tries to go off Vicodin
I'm fine thanks
and has hella withdrawal
hey Apokalipse
i know the ones GGgala_ :P. doesn't he mash his hand up to reduce leg pain xD
hey
good ta hear Apokalipse
Daz: yes. yes he does :P
at least i only missed a few eps ^_^
baseball one was the last one streamed, ya
still, want to repeat this: OMAGAD SO HYPED FOR SEASAN TWOAN
me too
aaaaaand still gotta ask silverscreen if i can do commentary trivia
then all the mods online had a skype chat and streamed it
Can't wait for the thread on a forum I go to to explode
again
and the sexiness of the mod's voices were compared
14Yeah, the Skype chat between all the mods didnt go so well. lol
lol, how did that go GGgala_ ?
awful quality at first, in and out
then it settled
wait...sirsprinkles, i hear, has a 'wookie sex' mic
weird-ass distortions
14My call kept getting dropped. After the 4th time I just gave up. :P
So, Octavia, as a new mod will you be able to stream more? or an extra mod to keep the rules more? also, nice colour
14lol Thanks. I can't stream right now unfortunately. My bandwidth is a bit lacking. But maybe after I move in a bit.
ah, ok
14Gotta love that DSL.
14Need my cable back, grr.
I don't think i've seen you much until you were made a new mod. Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Favourite (if any) Pony? (inb4 octavia) fave episode? maybe something outside the fandom that you would like to share :3 ?
/me rages becsaue the animator wont cooperate :C
/me still doesn't know what Wrek is animating
14I'm usually pretty quiet in the chat. Unless I really have something to contribute. And yes, obviously Octavia. :P
14My favorite ponies go from Octavia to Derpy to Trixie to Fluttershy. So out of the main my fav is Fluttershy.
mane*
:3
Fluttershy :3
14Favorite episode is a tough one for me. I love them all. But I'd say Best Night Ever.
14And I cu wut u did thar Apok. :P
awesome. have you read anything on season 2 yet?
14I read what was posted. I was one of the first in the comments afterall. :P
14I also have a friend on the show who tells me little bits here and there.
ooh
do tell
what does he do?
or she
14I cant really say much. They want to remain anonymous. lol
aww
Id liek to ask to refrain from spoilers please
14I know.
inb4 Wrek working on an actual official FiM thing with animating
14I asked them if I could maybe tell friends or such and they said theyd rather not right now. :P
nah im not that good
:(. still i want to see it as soon as it's possible :3
14I have seen some of de magicks! though.
14I wanted a speaking part in FiM, but no go unfortunately. lol
14Maybe next time!
That would be awesome.
Also Sprinkles has a new non-wookie sex mic now.
that's awesome though
14lol
14I need to get a new mic as well.
lulz, i wish i heard the old mic first
14Have this sucktastic headset I use.
Oh yeah, Dari became a unit/scale too.
and GGgala_ you really don't xD
Ghosties's voice was rated 8.2 deci-Daris in sexiness
The Dari
14But... wookie sex is like music to your ears, right? :)
Nope.avi guys. it's "[The DARI. A unit of measurement adapted to the assessment of the effect of low-dose radiation]. "
hahaha
Yeah, you get super powers.
...SEXY radiation?
:P
14lol
lol
also Daz i SO do. ...for science.
i am trying to imagine what wookie sex sounds like, and my brain isn't going there.
haha
ok there, rendering
ETA 30 minutes
berfect time for a nap
perfect*
so i'll see it once it's uploaded?
Your brain is trying to tell you that wookie sex probably doesn't sound pleasant
speaking of wookies Daz, i dare you to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43CBki2BVE
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "DJO - Fish Cream" - "Ooops - 2nd upload - had to fix some stuffffffff. It&#39;s all Mike&#39;s fault. Made possible by a grant from Mothers Against Light. Not responsible for lost or sto..."
it's...alright
14Oh, those guys.
woot Nightly Roundup
oooh. *reads*
14Earlyish too kinda.
>One prize was a Big Mac plush,
; )
do want
14Grr, another person posing as me. Too many Octvias!
14*Octavias
lol
haha
14I'm the original. :(
orly
there's so many >_<
14I came up with the name. :P Or one of the few who did. lol
14Guess "Octavia" wasnt as creative as I thought it was...
14Well, I liked it anyway. Seems others were thinking the exact same thing. :P
it fits so well though
14I know of at least one other person who claims to have first came up with it too. Guess they just happened to come up with it too.
14I thought so too.
14It was kinda obvious, but still, it has a nice ring to it.
very nice ring. it should be made canon, should she have more appearances
14Indeed.
14And I should voice her. Lmao. I can dream. :P
I haven't yet heard your voice. ah well, another day
I'm off for about 1 hour (daily run :P) Goodbie all =]
cya Daz, have a good run
14My voice sucks. Or I dont like it anyway. Unless I use a real good mic, it sounds rather retarded. :<
14If they rename her, I'll be sad.
14Laters, Daz
thanks a lot, Octavia, GGgala_ ^_^. also I think I am now sticking to Daz, and not Dman :P
and Octavia i will be VERY sad :(
i love music and play 2 instruments, and Octavia is so good
14Everyone loves the Octavia name so much. It'd suck.
14Mhm.
14I went as Derpy online for a long time before I did Octavia. But my friend on the show said I reminded them more of Octavia, simply from how I look and because I'm also a musician.
14Though like Derpy, I derp a lot too. :P
Well i'm changed and off. Yes love derpy too. The fannames are so fitting
I GO!
14lol Later
I hate when i start rendering, only to find out i forgot to disable an object that was in the way of the render, resulting in me having to start over
14Ouch.
it gets a tad tedious
You gunna talk with us on Skype next time Octavia? :P
14Perhaps. lol
14I'm still a little nervous. :P
14I did talk slightly on Skype earlier.
14But it dropped me so fast each time.
Aww.
I don't think I heard you.
14I know one or two did for a second. I know it dropped it in the middle of one time I was talking.
14I think I said maybe 3 or 4 things the entire time. :P
14I really hate my voice though.
14Need to work on it more.
14And get a mic that sounds better. :P
I usually find when people complain about a quality of theirs, there's nothing wrong with it.
Especially women. :P
counter-example, dari: Sethisto.
?
He says he has a terrible voice, and if you listen to the Q&Neigh podcast, you'll find that that's actually pretty accurate.
Lawl.
Exception that proves the rule.
that doesn't logic!
14Well, bed is a-callin for this pony now. Have a good night, or morning, everyone. :P
Night.

Polarfire didn't realize you'd left at the time
10oh, you

YFW showed explicit RBDxSoi pics in stream by accident.
You wanted...nay, demanded, the attribution of a certain fanfic?
mfw haven't seen them
and...RainBroDash i finally read 'dman x silvermane'
and ... just wat
Went to go an get links to PM to GGgala, wasn't paying attention to the capture area of the stream.
XD

:3 *
My spam email is king.
as.dfqwerty@hotmail.co.uk

>7000 emails
LOL. now about those pics :P
I'll get them to shame RainBro.
Hey, GGgala, you know that question you had earlier?
doo eet. i'm so saving these :P
And I said you should ask RainBro.
Well.
He's here now.

No.
You don't have to ask him.

eeyup
Interesting thing about the artist.
:>
they look like Topaz's drawings of Topaz x dermathil

You want to tell them the interesting thing about the artist RainBro?
ah

Trololo

So I can see RainBro squirm first.
Ohai
ohey Pegacorn
heya
>_< GGgala u know what's 'interesting' about artist?
Daz: NOPE. that's why i was asking RBD who it was.
/me is not startled yet
/me used Intimidate. Enem- FRIEND Pegacorn was startled
oh you dunnit now
/me rushes towards Daz while the Startled Witch music cue plays.
/me summons a shark
ikr lolwut amirite
/me kills the shark
/me keeps on running, toppling everything over as he goes. "Gah!"
/me garbles Witch sound effects while running toward Daz
/me gives chase, firing dual-wielded pistols into the running Pegawitch's back.
Take THIS, Pegabitch!
/me turns around and slashes GGgala in the face.
GRAH. NOT THE FACE.
DON'T EVER CALL ME THAT YOU SURVIVOR BASTARD!
/me runs back the other way
/me 's inner voice: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Why do you run Daz? You still have not called upon me. Face forward, Daz. You should be able to hear it now. That Witch, Pegacorn, blocks your ears with worthless fear. The enemy is one, you are one. What is there to fear? Cast off your fear. Look forward! Go forward!
/me 's inner voice: "Never stand still. Retreat and you will age. Hesitate and you will die. Shout‚Ä¶my name is‚Ä¶Dman!!!"
/me turns around, takes out his huge sword, and points it at the Witch.
lolwut
"Face me!"
Okay,if you want.
(eyedunnolol Pegacorn just RPing :3)
/me slashes Daz in the face
"AAaaagh!"
/me cuts Pegacorn
(um it was a quote from Bleach btw, i didn't just make it up)
/me stops running and glances back. He weighs his options.
"We can take 'im, GGgala!"
/me is bleeding,but nothing serious.
/me mutters "How do I let myself get dragged into these things?" and runs back into the fray, firing wildly.
/me dodges to the side
/me punches GGgala and then starts clawing him
AUGH.
NOOOO
/me slashes at the witch
"Get off!"
/me drops one pistol, and begins to raise the other one to his attacker's face
Sup Dman
/me gets off
Ohai Rodman, ya it's me :3
So you decided to change the username eh?
Nice
Sup everybrony, whats up¬°

"Aaaaa why won't you die"
/me suddenly transforms into a TAAAAAAAAAAAANK!
'Cause i'm invincible.
...I'm gonna hafta do this, aren't I.
TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK
/me revs chainsaw, advances on the Pegawitch
"RAAAAAAWRG!"
LOOK OUT DAZ!
/me gets out of the way
/me rips a piece of the ground and launches it at GGgala
/me doesn't understand if Pegacorn is with him or against him
Hey! Get back here, Pegab--
/me is hit by a massive chunk of concrete
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE DAZ!
/me closes in and starts smashing GGgala on the ground.
"But what the hell! Weren't YOU fighting me? as a Witch?"
/me runs from Rodman and Pegacorn, still confused.
AUGH. I HAVE OVER 200 BONES AND I CAN FEEL THEM ALL BREAKING.
DAZ!I'M STILL A WITCH,BUT I'VE COME TO MY SENSES!
/me runs back. "GGgala!"
Pegacorn, help me get Rodman off GGgala !!
/me begins swinging at Rodman
CAN DO!
DAZ!
/me runs towards Rodman and starts clawing him
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRG!
NOOOOOO!!!
...
/me punches the traitorous witch across the area
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
/me 10squirms
/me smashes against the wall of a Burger King
/me then back-hands Daz
/me slides down the wall he impacted, and hits the ground.
/me is thrown a long way
10nothing at all
/me hits the grounf
*ground
NOTHING AT ALL. NOTHING AT ALL! /Flanders
/me 10pokerfaces

RainBroDash: is the artist... named after a gemstone?
/me is hurt badly
herdmind, Daz.
/me decides to go against the witch, once more swinging his arms against the wicked being
AAAAAAAAAAH
/me brohoofs Daz
/me brohoofs GGgala

/me slowly stands, hacking up some blood. "No... Daz..."

I IS BRONY TANK! BROHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGF!!!"
"what is it GGgala?"
/me tries to dodge Rodman's attacks but is still hit by a bunch of them.
Daz! You're alive!

/me then picks up the witch once more and throws her at the survivors
Now! We have to help stop... the... *notices the Tank is fighting the Pegawitch*
OHMAHGAWD!

I think I'm gonna install Sacred again...
GGgala_: for my mind :3
Man, I miss Sacred
That game is fun
Yeah, tell me about it...
10mind_of_daz mfw you genuinely think there's more bad to good surrounding using alcohol as a stimulant O.o
I love the secret dragon bosses
LEVERAGE
10it's fucking awesome.
So f'in' epic
RainBroDash i'm only kiddin! i repeat: i know, i've done it, i know. just ajoke i've played on ya 3 times, y u no remember?
You know what's sweet?
10Well it seems pretty un-joke-like to me, since you keep saying it ;D
alcohol lowers heartpulse (possibly extending life) makes u use enzymes not used as much, and processes not used much in body = healthier body etc etc. i'm sure theres a shitton of other positives, but i cba to remember
Apart from Sweetie Belle and Sacred?
RainBroDash xD trololo
i had 4 beers y/day yay~
/me picks out a number at random and it happens to be HIS number
10and daz who cares about heart rates and bullshit :3
10s'all about the fun
so RainBroDash how many pints before you feel anything? (/ cans)
Daz: MFW i didn't notice Mind_Of_Daz spelled what it does XD
i'm interested
lol GGgala_
How are your ponies doing, Daz?
10daz I don't really drink beer, and it really depends on my mood, since if I'm happier I drink faster
RobotPinkie aww man! haven't even begun them :(. been out so much. i need to do them
o i c RainBroDash. would you say you have a particularly high / low tolerance thou?
10but if I drink quickly, I'm a bit of a lightweight. But I can drink a lot of alcohol and keep drinking and not be sick :3
Tried to do Pinkie's hair, but failed... Need to get hairpins
not be sick, but get tingly? high / low tolerance would you say?
RobotPinkie: get deeeemmm
10@daz I said I'm a bit of a lightweight
10:P
Am I strange for wanting the not-mane-character brushables?
Crap.My number came up.Again.
okies RainBroDash
Mope rb
I kinda want to catch 'em all, now...
10like, especially when hyper, it's a quick process into drunkenness
nope rb
no, RobotPinkie, you are as normal as I am...take that as you will
I'll take that as a compliment, then
Dwarf is best character in Sacred, btw.
GGgala_: would you say it was http://fondosdibujosanimados.com.es/images/wallpapers/jack-sparrow-908463.jpeg the opportune moment?
OPPORTUNE
Even if he can't diggy diggy hole, he can BLOW holes into shit
why dig when you can TNT
= D
lol diggy diggy hole
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
His mine drops are f'in awesome when you're overwhelmed by enemies and have to run
Daz: OH U
10daz implying being hyper even touches being drunk in the slightest :D The majority of my ridiculous stories are based on drunkenness
O RLY PEGACORN?
Yes.Yogscast joke.
This is when you say "I am DAVE! Yognaut! and I have the balls"
lol
10anyway, shower time
well, RainBroDash i guess that's true HOWEVER i'm not trolling, and mean this seriously: In My Opinion there are 2 ways that compare to being drunk in terms of 'different experience' and lolworthy / wtfy
10daz I completely do not understand the 2nd half of that post
10is it in swahili?
i have 2 other ways i have fun that i think are as good as being drunk
...u trollan meh?
10oh cool, what are they?
/me tackles Pegacorn into a lake. "KARMAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
btw they are staying up more than 50 hours (seriously bro i promise you this is true, i have auditory and visual hallucinations while awake, due to mind going semi asleep and AWAKE REM FOR THE WIN)
10Yeah, staying up is great, but it's not really as repeatable :P
and serious strain (such as 3 or 4 hour run in 55 degrees centegrade of spain) followed by sleep :P
i guess RainBroDash it is harder to do. but results can be better too
i've yet t osee ponies in my house sadly. ah well, perhaps i'll try again before school starts up
10imo daz they're both a little random, and not exactly plausible in all social situations
not social at all, that's why you go and drink :3 :3
OHGOD!KARMA ROBOTPINKIE HAS RETURNED!
10'let's have some fun' "kk gimme a sec, just gonna do a 4 hour run then have a sleep to get hyped up" lolwut
10xD
RobotPinkie left?
You've yet to see ponies in your house? I am now confused.
and RainBroDash that's a completely antisocial and on-yer-own thing ofc, that's y u go out with m8es xD
but uh that's my way of lucid dreaming best. srs work then bed :P
only had 1 pony dream so far and it was semipony aniways D:
I've had a couple... one was REALLY weird
Daz: semipony? eh?
well, GGgala_ iv'e said (maybe u remember) it was a dream where i went scuba diving

Red Dead Redemption, Spazturtle
7alright i'm nearly ready

@coolermeter anything Daz watched
6 anything Daz watched is 54% cooler. (1685)
why so much daz? n-not that I mind
Daz plays TF2 and L4D2 to my knowledge.
Well, depends on if you like open world games
Pegacorn: HARDLY. sorry bro, but look at my playtime
like, what, 4 hours l4d2 and 2 hours tf2 IN MY LIFE?
because your name is so close to Dash, and we all know RD makes everything cooler
GODDAMN.
If you do, then you will LOVE RDR, it's one of the best open world action games ever, pretty much.
so by extension, you make everything cooler
Daz: eargasm?
glad to hear it RobotPinkie i get very bored of vidya quickly, only the really goodo nes i can play and even then i can get bored
me gusta
yea GGgala_ i heard that it sounds amazing
/me is siging trololol
D:
7that beautiful pause screen :P
I love open world games because they look good in 3D
I,for some reason,wanna play TF2.
"i've heard all aobut you" " yea most people have, they live in one"
But i'll stay here since it's more fun to stay here.
Ziltoid: Was that supposed to be signing, or singing?
singing
I typo
ah
signing 'trolol?'
Your faithful student, trololol
trolling the deaf? you bastasrd
Uncharted is like an action movie, it has zero open world elements. Not really comparable to RDR.
tr0lling deaf? House does this in an episode with 'FIGHT THE POWER' xD
lol
oh House!
i have seen 2 hours of uncharted, RobotPinkie it looked good
Daz speaks the truth
lul
About House that is.
what, he's a genius asshole? xD
Yes
I love the Uncharted games, the have great story, great acting and great action.
But they're extremely linear.

may I ask why more mods are needed?
suudenly yes
7We are recruiting both for future plans
/me 7cant share any more information yet
hmm...i m just wonderin', as there seems to be plenty'a mods already
7Just be around often
i mean, if you were to make more than one livestream it would divide some of us D:
cuz of where we would wanna be
My official instructions:Kill all sons o' bitches.
lol

7Like I said we're looking for both
doesn't get any more official than that Pegacorn xD

bjornfort is the reason why the mod staff has had to be quadrupled XD
lol
Pegacorn, you know this to be true xD
?
Waddaya mean?
'you know this to be true' is a way of saying 'amirite' like 200 years ago. thought it was known : /
eg: YOU ARE DOOOOOMED YOU KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE.
lawl
Like when Vader said "Search your feelings.You know it to be true",right?
lol Sathi is getting her soundboard on :P
for example. it's commonly used in dramatic moments of memories
movies *
wtf how i typo movies for memories
lol
lol
7your head is full of ponies
dat house
RobotPinkie: still g2 brush, haven't done yet
It is, Sathi
sure is
7I even use eeeeeeyup at work.. or during business meetings
mfw i can't quote cuz nobody here knows english : /
mfw when season 1 dub airs i will quote 24/7
Just wait for the awesome dub, Daz!
>my face when when
RobotPinkie: just said that :P
lol
you beat me to it
yea i know GGgala_ i just do that
i see 'mfw' as an image of a face rather than 'my face when'
OHHH
ah well
yo'ure right, i shouldn't do that, it's incorrect
DEAD
7no
/me squints. "it's a face?"
and THIS is a very mild case of pony withdrawal symptoms xD
oh dear weird lighting
amirite?
but yeah, just never pull too hard on the hair when you brush, you'll put it into knots
GGgala_ no it's not a face, i just think a face when I see 'mfw'
she's a brony who hasn't done anything Pony for 24 hours, and the cure is more pony
z'ok Daz. didn't mean ta bug ya
you're right, though, GGgala_ my post scuks and I should feel bad xD (zoidberg)
sucks *
>mfw I use mfw http://archive.no-ip.org/images/co/thumb/0235/11/1297821514490s.jpg

Well, yeah... I guess I am
ITZ NOT ATUMAH
OOON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONAAAAAAAAAAAA
BEEEEEEEEEE-YAAAAAACH

I just searched "forever alone pony" though, so it's not my pun :P
Its all about the ham
I love ham...
ham to ham combat best combat
dat pun
I'm trying to stop eating meat though.
why?
except for fish.
why's that?
Eh, because it's better for my health
7fish is healthy
"it's really...quite beautiful" never change house
never change
7especially fresh fish
but why would you stop eating other meat too?
(just asking btw i'm not mentioning my eating orders here or anything, i'm just interested to know)
hiya ppl! long time no chat!
House:Your dumb
>mfw i read 'eating orders' as 'eating disorders' >.>
well it seems healthier to switch to a pescetarian diet, and I don't really like how the meat industry is run...
hahaha
and i guess so RobotPinkie, btw i laughed at GGgala_'s comment
Cat, hihi!
/me hugs cat
i admit, i thought "an eating disorder that makes you eat meat?"
I'll still eat sheep from my parents' farm sometime, because I know they've been taken well care of
i'm lucky enough to live in such a remote area of spain that i can actually go and see our chickens, pigs, etc be slaughtered and meat taken, so i have relatively good heet here
but that's like... a couple of times a year, so...
meat * not heet
/me 7hats the bio industry
7hates*

he was the guy that had very little availablity
To whom it may concern, Thank you for eventually returning a reply in regards to my application, but unfortunately, I must decline this interview and the future offer of modship. I had to be realistic and sadly determined that with my academia on the rise and with an additional commitment to a kick-start project with twenty other partners, I cannot guarante
myself 100% with assisting BronyState. I apologize for wasting your time. Best wishes, Al Capony

Oh man, one of those poses in that game is just aweful
How's it going MirthTinker?
..mine looked like he had the picture of a nebula as skin
and insect eyes
The Soarin/Caramel one is good.
Bio: Rutabaga Slip is a farmer pony who makes a living growing, you guessed it, Rutabagas. He's a little odd, often making carvings of other ponies out of his namesake vegetable using his magic. Though a bit zany, he gets along just fine with anypony in ponyville.
cont.: Nopony really knows where he came from, or who his parents were so how he got such a unique coat remains a mystery. Someponies speculate he had a zebra father and a pony mother, others say it was some kind of unfortunate accident in Everfree forest. Regardless, Rutabaga works and plays just like everypony else and if you mention his coat or mane he won
cont.cont.: Quick to forgive and forget, he often forgets too much and this gives him a lot of trouble with small things like remembering pony‚Äôs names or where he put his housekeys. His cutie mark is a peeled rutabaga curled into a smile.
just sent it to Cereal, hope it gets mentioned :D
7it keeps derping right?
oh hai Pegacorn, didn't see you in all the spam
yeah, Sathi
or for me it does

Oh man, I randomized again, and this one is even worse
Ya all ready?
You broke the rules, Edward!

I fear so, are you able to be online tomorrow at 1:30 PM eastern?
14lol You're fine CB.
What's that in GMT?
Because I don't want to make the same mistake
What a shitty day this is...
Jack Layton passed away. :(
>cries
Yeah.I heard it too.
14:P
14Here, have a pony!
Jack Layton was a really good person.
/me 14gives CB a pony, yayy~
14:P
Have you read his letter yet?
/me accepts the pony.
Nope.
so now i'm going to make timeconversions? :p
http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/08/22/pol-layton-last-letter.html
god
14So much fun!
14I luv me sum time cnoversions.
This does not bode well for him of he's too lazy to check for himself. Is this important to him or not?
eastern is GMT -5
exactly my thoughts
14Eh, it doesn't show up well for him, thats for sure.
17:30 my time, I'm availible
No wait... 18:30
14He may just be genuinely ignorant to these types of things. Timezones used to confuse me too a bit.
its not exactly a dealbreaker, but something to consider
Where do you live?
is he going to show up to events on time?
Sweden, GMT +1
notsurehowtofeelsicneidontknowwhoitis.jpg
14Well, thats the big question obviously.
Goddamnit, it's so hard to find an easy to use timezone converter
Well it's 3:40 PM eastern now
Canadian politician, Wrek.
Leader of the Official Opposition in Canada.
notsurehowtofeelsincewrekspelledsincewrong.jpg
so that would mean according to my clock 19:30 your time
19:30... alright
14He's also not from the States, so I can see it being maybe a little harder for him with the time.
Please be on time this time
I'm usually not late, it's just that I got a bit confused by the converter
i'm europe maneland
soooo
14I know.
14I'm just saying.
But yeah, I'll make it on time
14Its more than an hour or two difference.
i hate tpos
Alright see you tomorrow then
notsurehowtofeelsincehe'snowputtingonsomeponies.jpg
Yep
14Which would be easier to be thrown off by.
typos*
14If you're not good with things like timezones.
whoa, !!Applejack is back on ponychan
Awesome, there are now videos of Scootaloo, Cheerilee, Sweetie Belle, and Pinkie Pie for their 3.5 incarnations.
WTF TONY RANDALL IN MY PONIES?
Are we repeating the episodes from yesterday?
14Should I know who that is? I haven't been on Ponychan much in a while.
/me 's head explodes
Hello.
Hello Wrek welcome
Thank you, Its good to be here ^^
First of all excuses for the delay.
Everypony,i've just created a Steam group dedicated to Jack Layton.Join it if you want.
Wrek, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
Do you have any questions before we start?
Ok.
OHSHI-
WHAT WAS THAT?
No i'm good
your face exploding
7How did you hear about us?
Through a fellow friend of mine named Sathi.
7Oh I know her!
Oh you do? marvelous!
7How many movienights have you attended so far?
Moochick is now best chick.
I think its around 7 or 8 by now, memory is a tad fuzzy.
7What do you like most about our movienights?
man, random makes some UGLY ass ponies
Yes I know this guy ;)
True dat
14We kinda figured that out, yes. :P
Foremost the feeling of watching a movie with bronies. I like the whole concept overall with randomly choosing a few movies and episodes on a weekly basis. (and the chat is hilarious most of the time.)
Stream really not working well for me... oh well
Time for some sea ponies
7I see, is there anything you dislike?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
10I'm not watching the stream atm, EGIdrA is streaming (starcraft 2 player) <3
Is IdrA raging yet?
Only thing I can think of at this time would be the add right above the chat. Other than that I think I safley can say that I enjoy every nanomillimeter of it.
7Do you have any experience with moderating?
Wow, never thought I'd enjoy G1 ponies so much...
10haha nah he lolololoololofjangafowned Deezer earlier, who is just as famous for rage
10deezer got so mad
10soso mad
Sorry about the delay
got disturbed
I have previous experience with moderating
7Can you specify that?
Several web forums and a few IRC chatrooms
7What is your availability for moderating?
This is hilariously ridiculous... rofl
my times would be for weekdays durign the evening between 10pm to perhaps 2 or 3am. as for weekends I would have more or less full availabillity unless something comes up.
7I see
7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
7In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
7As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
dat division rank on the SC2 stream
10it's all ZvZ ;___;
LASER
10he roflpwnd some 'toss players earlier
10that was amusing
I would contribute with my thoughts, oppinions and ideas during internal dicussions regarding say, to change how something will work. I would contribute with my skillset as an graphical artist. Aswell as contributing with common sense and fairness, and hopefully a tad of humour.
What is the stream Rainbro?
10http://www.twitch.tv/eg_idra
<3
7Any other ideas?
14Hah
i like this guy so far
you should see his work
14He seems capable.
14Oh Sathi?
i'll show you in a bit
/me is intrigued
http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-1311252959133.jpg?w=640
...wow
thats really good
14Not bad.
when it comes to ideas, perhaps things to stream, building youtube playlists for instance. And putting my artistical skill to use, lets say Bronystate would like a new banner, I would volunteer to make it.
He draws ponies. Hire this man.
14Braeburn.<3
7Can you link us some recent work?
Indeed I can, one moment please.
14He mentioned a banner.
14I was thinking the same thing.
y u haet me, stream?
Y u hate me as well stream?
@hip did you see the thing I linked on modchat? the bronystate rendering?
we are going to need banners for the rooms once we get the site set up
he made that
having a graphic designer would be a HUGE plus
i saw the pic you just posted, but nothing before that
7please do so
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pbwb6btGiI
There's only so much of G1 ponies I can take before I need more House... srsly...
aww removed
was private url
14Yeah. :/
14Also, I just noticed.
14He did that TF2 crossover pic I liked. Very nice.
yep
and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrUW9TaAd_w
14Very snazzy.
/me surprise glomps RainBroDash. "HEY WAIFU!"

are a few from there
OHSHI-
14Dr. Whoof and Soarin. <3
7Alright I think we've seen enough for now plus we have both links should any other team-members be interested
SUDDENLY SILVERMANE
ok
7What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
The hell is "glomp"?
hey everypony
Ohey Silvermane
a 'glomp' is a full-body tackle hug
TACKLE?
v, to glomp NOT sexual, it is the action of one person lovingly (and dramatically) attacking another with a h
from urban dictionary
/me karma charges Silvermane`
Not that kind of tackle, Pegacorn, lol
pretty much, EN
*Silvermane
/me flies above Pegacorn
Oh, too late
TOO LATE
also, OMFG I FOUND A 'OF MARES AND MAGIC' IMAGE

http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--EOMfS6fEbQ/TlG5P2BL_2I/AAAAAAAAACs/M17NPkJXsBE/s1600/trixie_the+magnificent.jpg
KARMAAAAAAAAAAA
karma can suck it
well, if i didn't have like 3 waifus already, that is
WEEIIGHH ANCHAAA
an example Pegacorn
princest is wincest? http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XzVkbeaDACw/TlG5GqXEyAI/AAAAAAAAABk/2XYOdGG7iF0/s1600/48075+-+artist+fiarel+celestia+luna+morning_ponies+pajamas+shipping+sisters.png
YAR AR FIDDLEDEEDEE
exactly EdwardNewgate!
Everything is better with Kigo
i think Princesst is Wincest is the new thing to say
GET A CHARGER IN HERE.WE NEED KARMA CHARGES!
i think this image is highly suggestive http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pJeSgfxO0PQ/TlG5F_dPmRI/AAAAAAAAABc/t2PWvCyXjag/s1600/48050+-+artist+fiarel+blank_flank+cola+twilight_sparkle.png
A few of my small ideas would be to see if there's an interest in touching up the page itself, perhaps unique streaming events (like the upcoming LOTR weekend) telling my brony friends that "hey, there's this site that are streaming these movies tonight, care to tune in and watch it with me?". Since increasing viewership is quite an unpredictable thing,
Epic Coca-Cola maneuver
...
Only if there is a "secret ingredient" in that brony cola
Yes, it is...
I would probably jsut ask the viewers themselves, what do you want?
it's EXTREMELY suggestive, but I love the artists talent
How is it suggestive?
7Any ideas about our site in it's currents form?
Pegacorn, if you don't know, I'm not one to tell you
frankly, i'm not mean enough to break such innocence
You know what's suggestive?Ivy getting less and less clothing in the newer Soul Calibur games.
That's not suggestive at all.
he tried to draw one of my cats
but eventually gave up
http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-dsc00120.jpg?w=640
too much furr
pegacorn, i think that's classified as fan-service
Silvermane the real question is, did the artist intentionally make it suggestive?
ASS EXPOSED.BOOBS EXPOSED.IS THAT SUGGESTIVE ENOUGH FOR YA?
GODDAMNIT NAMCO STOP KILLING MY CHILDHOOD.
The layout itself is quite neat actually, I would say it needs a touch of paint giving the viewers an even more enjoyable experience with the site.
no, it's just exposure. Suggestive material implies sex and sexual behaior
oh
RobotPinkie. WAT
OHSHI-
lolol
@WATmeter RobotPinkie
6 RobotPinkie is 7% WAT. (1693)
that looks really good imo
but i also know nothing about art
lol Pizzapony is still logged in?
PizzaPony is in here?
technically
the chat on my ps3 let me log in, but it never popped up
7You mentioned you have IRC experience can you be more specific to us?
14I think it looks good too. And I'm an artist as well. Plus, kitty. :>
I love my cat's!
14I love cats. But I'm allergic too. :'(
aww
i have 2 cats
pics sometime Hip?
but at home, not my apartment
i dont have a digital camera, or any pics of them on my comp
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G99j0G-fqs8/TlG5Hk4hliI/AAAAAAAAABs/q9-hCeNB9os/s1600/48142+-+artist+takokyoc+spitfire+wonderbolts.jpg
Oh
OHSHI-
My favorite of the drawfriend, if only becuase Spitfire is best pony
Hot!
one is old and has diabetes, the other is fat as hell
I killed Spitfire BTW.With a forklift.Huzzah.
and no, we all had a talk, and we agreed that Zecora is the best pony
I have some base command knowledge, and i was placed as a temporary mod to cover for another guy a year back or so. so when it comes to the actual moderation im a bit rusty though a quick learner, and ive been a user of IRC for a few years now.
NO YOU DIDN'T SPITFIRE IS INVINCIBLE
/me has Spitfire's corpse on his shoulder.
14Fat kitty. <3 Fat cats always make me smile.
@pony best pony
*Ahem*Gentlemen?
6 best pony is 5Snai10ls
...
pegacorn NO U
BLAME WITH A SPARK.
7Alright, I think that concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.
Okey dokey loki
7I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
wtf EQD spam
14Though at the same time I feel kinda sad for them.
I need to read the RR of the RRR
still
ok
Nice alliteration on that last one
I'll post some cat pics in a bit
7 1 st image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/b0888f66a008c11f490c79ec5656059f/26664%20-%20artist%3Aopalwhisker%20Cupcakes%20dexterous_hooves%20dress%20fanfic%20pinkie_pie.png
ANYTHING SMART TO SAY NOW EDWARD?
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM
Huh?
THE THREE GENIUSES, REMEMBER?
Orite
>yfw my cat weighs 19 pounds
But i killed a WAY before that happened.
*i killed her
I CANT BRAIN TODAY
The image itself is ok by my standards. though the message given is up for discussion. I would keep an eye on the poster.
14Eep
why would you do that?
14Eh, I've seen heavier. lol
OH MY FUCK IT'S SEA PONIES
I told you Edward!
What the...
my mom's college roommate had a cat called "fat kitty"
it was 25 pounds iirc
(also, you have no idea how happy I was when I found a good second person X Spitfire clopfic)
SHOOBEDOO SHOO SHOOBEDOOO
EdwardNewgate, which one?
Dashite, give me a sec
mfw 2nd person clopfic. last one i read was a Dash fic
Edward,WHAT IS THIS I DONT EVEN.
Spreading Your Wings and Hers
14Daaayum.
14Thats one fat feline.
Silvermane, which one is that?
yeah
Spreading Your Wings and Hers, is a 2nd person starring you and Rainbow Dash
Yeah, there's a few of those
OHSHI-
it's cloppy
so, what happened to house?
Yeah, there's a lot of those too
That's the really cloppy one right?
The intent of the image is clear. but not "showing" anything makes it hard to deem. I would probably remove the image and warn the poster if it was a first offence, but im leaning more towards a ban for this one.
7Third image:
it's quite intense, although it uses metaphors and thought processes rather than technical terms and descriptions
....
7http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
7House will be coming
Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of.
7finishing up some things
7give me a moment
Vol 4
okie dokie
also, Dashite. It's fire in the evening sky
FIRE
FIRE
hmm... i think i should read through some of the comps
only read 2 or 3 stories from them so ar
Most of them are amazing
even if they are in 2nd person, which I dislike a little bit
yeah, so i've heard. i don't go in for clopfic usually, since, you know, I can't use it for anything. shipping that results in sex is one thing, but shipping for the sake of sex just isn't my style.
14Images are so hard. Because the line can be blurry sometimes with whats tame enough and whats not. I still need to study that line a bit better by the standards here.
yfw I'm responsible for all the rape and sex-shipping on this sie
site*
Are you guys watching the stream?
YOU BASTARD
14Listening to it.
:P
14lol
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAUSED ALL THIS TO ME!
Most of them are honestly about romance, not sex
which is why I like them
true, that scaling system was interesting
I wouldnt call a ban on this one. Its shipping yes, but I dont think its enough to cause a ban. its leaning towards keeping an eye on the poster. If said poster escalates the bannign of said poster will be an easier decision.
cat there
they only put like one 'Woah!' story in each, right?
Nah, you brought that on yourself Pegacorn.
7Fourth and final image:
Yeah, one or two
LIES DASHITE
7http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
Even those aren't overly explicit though
Whatever helps you sleep at night Pegacorn. :p
ban
there is either a fox or a cat on my screen
14Aww, kitty.
I think about Karma charging internet trolls.It helps me sleep.
ohai mib
14Happily perched on his post. :P
Hip how you feel about him?
i like him
KITTEH
you said you know him, right?
7That was the last part of the interview
Ans if elaborated, it violates the posting rules, so depending on the system you use, then ban
7Do you have anything to add?
yep I do
what are your feelings on his personality?
D'AWWWWWWWW
KITTEHS ARE CUTE
I would just like to thank you all for taking your time with me, whatever happends i will still show up at the LOTR event. Keep up the great work you do, and good luck in the future.
Kittehs are almost as cute as ponehs
7Wait a moment please
He's open minded, creative and easy going, nows when to joke and when to be serious
True dat,but only G4 ponehs
I think personally he would be a great addition with his abilities
Will do
Well, definitely not G3.5, that's for sure...
7We are discussing your interview
Other G's are creepy as hell.
Hideous hellbeasts
i would say a definite yes in that case
I will be back in a few seconds, urgent bathroom visit
I got to give him my vote. His abilities will be quite useful, he hit the questions correctly, good attitude.
want to do it straight away or want to let the other mods vote first?
inb4 Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
he nailed the pics for the most part, he can do graphic design, and he has a personal recommendation from you, thats enough for me to say yes
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
uh, how many were here when we hired the others?
/me always dresses in Rainbow Dash
wait, what does that even mean?
Ghosties was here Sprinks and Dari
I don't know, probably something dirty :P
lol
/me always dresses to impress Spitfire
Ghosties just logged on

3Nice.

So...Sathi, how do I start my training?
3Thats....interesting Barry.
8got an opinion on it from a friend who is an artist, he said it looks excellent
We will look into that in a bit DE
3Danke Shone
14What about the other artist here, hmmmmm?
we could train DE and wrek at the same time
saves time
4I particularly have one tiny problem with it
14I could use some training as well...
5good, tell me what and ill see if i can fix it
4The spinning reel? Anyway you can add sound to that?
4It's bugging me how silent it is
14People forget about me alot. :(

Suddenly, DADDY ISSUES IN A HOSPITAL

5i was thinkign along the lines of this one http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=118196
14Also, I guess I should have included I also do art once in a blue moon too in my interview. But I'm still working on ponies.

7Wrek is your name registered on our chat yet?
5I do not know
3I had an feeling that you were an artist...I dont know why...
3I guess some kinda internet vibe?
14I haven't uploaded anything in a long time though. And nothing pony yet.
14Perhaps. lol
14I'm a perfectionist. I wont showcase my work until its of just a certain quality.
3And replace "password" with a password, and "email" with your email
Fuuu

14I've been too busy lately to really work on it. But I want to get back to it soonish.
14I was actually better when I was around 12 I think. lol
14I used to do nothing but draw back then.
3I envy you...I cant draw worth anything...:(
Dat makeup
5i think it worked

14I was one of the best in the district. And aww. You might just need practice. Heaven knows I do now.
