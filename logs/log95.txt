0EXCEPT FOR SNAKES
0inb4 boss fight
you hate adorable little snakes? :(
LOL
hi Angel
I'd still hit it
0RobotPinkie, i was talking in-character for the show. everypony is afraid of snakes
02Angel, such a timming, lol
blarg
^
0lol EdwardNewgate
looks like I've gotta get packing now
13o-o
02<Nick> the vids alone is impossible to watch!
02BUT IN THIS TOUHOU
02DEATHBOMBING IS IMPOSSIBRUUUU
13ohai :3
I have to take of lads
have a good time, and enjoy DURRRRRRRGARRRRRRR
well afraid and hate don't have to go hand in hand
bye Val
;o
and in the event I don't come on later, have a good Monday and Tuesday
13:D
later all
Did AE change IP/Locations?
02Angel teach me how to deathbomb in MoF
02;AAAAA;
MWAHAHAHAHAH
Bye Val.
13I can't teach you LOL
13You have to learn to adapt like I did
Huh SilverMane?
02;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;
13aka Bomb before the bullet actually hits you
/me cries
13and if you feel pressured, don't hold back on using a bomb
'sup Hipster_Brony
13so you can easily regain it back
02But here is the point
o hai ponies
02I only used bombs in Deathbombing
0Vehrn makes this battle pathetic
02So...
02;A;
Rayngel
13That's why I said you have to ADAPT
/me runs
0watch as he hits for like 500 damage
Also, >posting the events in a more timely manner
02+ I rush to much D:
12!Shipping
13Once you learn to use bombs outside of deathbombing-only, it'll really help you in the long run even with other games :3
...we do it within 24 hours of PICKING THE MOVIES
Oo
12._.
yfw
13!espeon
Do you have any previous IRC experience?
02In the first 5 stages I NEVER go at the bottom of the screen
0it protects them from magic
0so whoever is weakest against magic
02and that is followed by silly mistakes
i'll just wrap it up
inb4 Dari plays requests,but i'll still post my request.
this is a no for me
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJEEy2IKOI8&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
Yeah, no for me as well
02Anyways, bbl :\
He doesn't seem to really want it
13Don't stick to certain patterns if they're not working
0dark damage heals her
L4D2 FTW
exactly
02Yeah, I should
@nick thanks
02But it's easier said than done
0get some heals up in this bitch

13You should adapt naturally over time
0i suggest tossing a potion at mardek
02Anyways back in 2-4 hours
/me now belongs to FiveYearOldDamos for 14 minutes
He's still gonna die
0for security reasons
o.o
13especially as the more times you play through the stages, you'll get to know the bullet patterns and how its set out
SECURITY?NOPE.
yfw someone dies
02Yeah ;-;
02Anyways Kthxbai

12bbl
0one of the enemies drops a great item
0it's hilarious
Same here
yes, but that was because he had a legit excuse the first time, and he was a potential hub streamer
What's the item, SilverMane ?
Only things I am knowledgeable about are networks, anime and world of warcraft, most of which don't come up often in here
*shrugs*
yes?
Okay :P
0use the map to find it
0it flashes yellow on the map, like chests
and I like anime and WoW.... or well, used to like WoW, don't have time for it anymore.
Well, that's a no from me, I'll vote on the forum.
hehe 4 noes :P
Says 5 on the forum
:P
I'm still around mostly for my guild's sakes
He's out
yes
0stop clopping to zombies
I have not updated his status, just like to be sure
0i get it
0and now i'm sad
Like I wouldn't mind if I could just raid once a week and that's it, but then you have to find a relaxed enough guild :P
My guild is pretty fun times, I would've quit years ago if it wasn't for them
Yeah, we're that kind of a guild
7A wild Sathi appeared!
0Prince-Dari, if you beat the next dungeon, you are free to complete all side quests and loot runs
0the GeoJacket and Key should be gotten now
fffffuuuuuu
0it's easiest for skill grinding, but not necessary
0from Chapter 1
If you want to raid once a week you're fine, if you want to move on up the ranks, you have to commit to two nights a week
0Geojacket is the item the Shaman droppped; have to get it off her body
ill try and get back as soon as i can
0requires you to go back to her
0just don't forget
See ya
Right now school and work take up too much time during the week, though
Oh yeah, I don't blame you at all.

Skyrim looks awesome, though
0hit it
0it sorts the current characters inventory
0it's more realistic though, on exhaustion and mana usage etc
4Morrowind actually didn't have scaling, which is one of Oblivion's worst problems
It was also a bit too simplified
0scaling allowed me to return to dungeons later though, whcih i loved

6I assume you're looking at the dinkypage site.
I've only got limited experience setting up websites.
yeah, sorry to hear that :(

That should be it for today then

I've played thru most of Monster Girl Quest
yes
Also, can we move on in the interview or is this necessary :P
I think we're getting off topic
The co.cc page was our fallback during the dinkysite downtime.
Sorry, actually backspaced there.
Tell me: Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
*accidentially
I kinda wish they wouldn't, tbh... but oh well.

He justs didn't want to put that as the story image
*rereads* oh, yeah.
lol

LOL!

I know. I was surprised when the dinkypage was suddenly gone. And just to help out primarily. I have a good time here chatting and taking part in the movie nights. Figure why not help out if I'm needed as well?

If he becomes mod then you may continue the conversation as needed. But we've got another interviewee waiting
For like, two seconds, because that's where it went. But whatevs.
Actually
Okay.
That's just me, though, and I don't call the shots. :P

i'd rather it be word-of-mouth, but at least it's getting out there

06someone try ! pants
That was the last part of the interview
02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
he did it a week ago
Do you have anything to add?
wtf..?

>yfw I already have :P
06kidding me
how did that happen?
06if you type ! pants
06you disconnect
mfw It's still awesome
No
level 10? Wow, slow grind.
You cycle
06who invented that?!
The initial application as well as the first half of the interview was good.
odd....
06>.<
The second half of the interview just shows they need to be a bit more strict and work on their IRC knowledge.
It's like /cycle or /hop
@pony Silvermare's indisputable waifu for all eternity
6 Silvermare's indisputable waifu for all eternity is 5Chief Thund11erho15oves
:p
and exp gain drops at a ratio between current elvel and target level
13That's quite clever
13xD
Hot.
XD
at least he's important?
06!pant
06phew
Oh okay
06now try !pant
06lol
!pant
/me pulls down Aeroslash's pants and runs
lol
O.O;
/me pulls them back up
how embarassing
13pant != pants
did you see his last comment?
Not me, i'm just the local godling
I did.
XD
I'm thinking about it.
13Because pants = underwear here
or Celestia
13LOL
I can believe that.
wut
07and then suddenly
07!espeon
13!kyu
The only problem with that comment is that he's thinking about the rules as they pertain to the viewers' tastes, not to our rules
07|3
07@.@
13:D
07:3
You have to think as a moderator, not a viewer
Alright, I say hire.
/me squished
/me is tiny o.o
as in now or tell next show?
If we hire, he definitely needs to be shown the ropes
13You're heavier than you look :P
/me flees
07D:
/me fistshake!
One moment please
that works very well
Alright.
wut
Yeah I guess dari's calling the shots...
good plan
mfw^
13I read that as fishshake at first
It makes sense!
DE is here...as far as I know
06ok
OHGOD I REALLY WANT GMOD.
06now try !trousers
yes he is
....
I told him to wait
The Gmod ponies look awesome
/me really should stop smoking...
idle though
gmod?
07!boxers
I should quit the snus...
he can insta-kill them without smite
!briefs
Gary's Mod
07firstshake
Then, we can proceed as necessary
07o.o;
How do you even get The Hub (in HD)? Are the only two ways through Verizon or At&T?
*Garry
I remember giving some americans snus, 1 of them cursed the shit, the otehr praised it
ok
oh garry's mod
4Denied_Existence
because they're not allowed to take smoke breaks
though they call it "dip"
Hiya
combat training, hit the snus, like a baws
lol
Chew and dip are the same
Sort of
Mardek can cast Heal on undead to hurt them
You don't "chew" dip
Really, Edward? They tried mine, I tried theirs... only difference was which lip they put it under :P
Alright.
I'll go ahead and bring DE in
^mfw
Alright
Tell me when you're done
Skoal is kinda awful, though
hey Quan
06hey quan
06try ! pants
>mardek useful
7Hello, you two.
!pants
06try it please!
Don't listen to that Lightumbreon
heya Quan
13ohai Quan :3
i'm ready
They kinda agreed, but it's expensive to import swedish snus...
http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/3ds/en_na/3dsambassador.jsp?menu=about&submenu=ctr-ht-amb-lookup
/me awaits the europe one of that badly...
/me realizes that he still has dari on a leash
I'd rather smoke, but only cause it looks cooler. I like dip more though, because the effects are stronger
Woah.What happened?
Pegacorn....thats...interesting....
http://ambassador.nintendo-europe.com/ (coming soon)
THIS ONE IS MADE OF ADAMANTIUM
IT CANNOT BE CUT
OR DESTROYED
Okay, bringing him in
It redirects to NoE's language selector atm
she doesn't need any ideas
Hi, DMan
Have you read my story, yet
Ohey Barry, how are ya?
Hey Dman
If not, you may want to re-download it
4Denied_Existence
Sadly, no, i've been away ALL DAY, but it's actaully here open, i am now about to:P
the book can also be, a hat
ohey Dman
Emela can't wear kettle hat, as kettle hat is a half-helm
she can't wear half-helms
mfw "kettle hat"
and dari is talking about playing cards
Kettle hat is a metal helm that the French used
i do believe
put her hat back on
Welcome, Denied_Existence
7Welcome Denied_Existence

Pretttttty much
020.00000000000000000000000001 secs given
Are we supposed to care about the ghostie?
yes, EdwardNewgate :P
13LOL
Why do we bother with Ponychan threads?
RAMIREZ!GIFT ME GMOD!
Oh, that's right... we barely care about them anymore.
RAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZRAMIREZ
4You don't have to care. Just have some modesty, that's all I ask
Haha
02I still can't pull it in an normal basis
RAMIREZ!FUCK EMELA
You sound like my best friend
02but it's close enough
allo'
13Again, you don't HAVE to restrict yourself to just deathbombing in MoF since you can easily regain bombs :P
Is giggling WITH, 'stead of at, modesty?
02Yeah :P
amidoinitrite?
hey Dman!
(keep the puns coming!)
*spuured*
I FOUND IT!

RAMIREZ!WALK THE DINOSAUR!
/me yawns
4>cooler
oh
If it wasn't for the fact that his show airs tomorrow and there'd be no time for him to prepare a timeslot to ask about our upcoming LotR event, I'd say go ask him.
/me throws the silk neckpiece at Silvermare
But he probably has all his timeslots filled.
RAMIREZ!CATCH IT!
4I used a pun?

/me flies away
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMAAAAAAAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7I see
4Oh, I thought EdwardNewgate was implying that I made a pun
Ooohhh
7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
Well...
4I mean
4I made a pun much earlier
4But no one got it

4Yeah, I did
I GEDDIT... i think

Hrm
Here's a touching story.Once upon a time you died and i lived happily ever after.The End.
Flashbacks to the.....you know.......that thing at the place...
13Play th13 ~
:p
and there was that one pony...
02Not playing th13 before everyother one before :P
02I want to keep the order
02:3
13:3
13th10 then~
02Already beated Easy, Normal makes me cry
13Normal is easy for me until I get to stage 4
13LOL you cheat
13Shouldn't be playing extra until you beat normal~
02And this is why I haven't beated PCB's extra, lol
4Fuck yeah, Morrowind!
4*brohoof RobotPinkie*
WOAH WOAH GGGALA.
/me sits on Angel's head
>2 hours from Brihton. :/
Brighton*
Well that's not TOO bad, is it?
Trains, I dunno.
Oh...
the*
13Now with voices and English subs~
YOU IMPLIED SOMETHING GGGALA.
Do they mind, or are they cool?
They're fine with it.
Phew, that's good at least
02WAIT WAIT WAIT
02The revived the project?
02they*
13That's the fanmade anime from this year :P
02Oh, lool
/me hits GGgala over the head with a baseball bat
Fine by me
13I think you're referring to Maikaze, which have announced they're releasing ep 2 this year sometime
Those names were getting to me :P
BECAUSE I WANTED TO
/me 7blinks.
7Fanmade anime. O.o
Names like Fnordheeun Euthrooewjrened Schnweeeeeeeeeeee
Skype?
Or IRC?
4Octavia?
Hmm?
6IRC
4PM
Oh
There we are.
LIES
6Ah, there you are.
7Welcome once again
Welcome again
Thnak you.
Alright, listen up
Damn.
Both of you
WB Sky :0
6I'm glad to inform you both that we've decided to hire you both. =D
Yes?
We've decided to hire you
YOU TOTALLY IMPLIED.....you know......what happened.
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
6However!
Think my ISP's DNS server exploded or something.
Thank you for this grand opportunity
Yes, however
You both need a great deal of training
Yeah
Firstly
hi Kos!
http://bronystate.co.cc/rules/
hi aero~
6You both need to get a more firm grasp on the rules as far as images and such go.
Read them
Yup, I've been reading the rules to get as informed as I can with them.
Yea
13ohai Kosoveon~
6The second image is R34, which is a verbal warning.
ffffffffuuuuuuuu
6The third image is just plain shipping, which is fine.
I thought I had said verbal warning for the first.
Last image is where you both really messed up
I did?
Oh, I missed the gore clause.
It's explicit gore and shipping
Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to tear up old wounds...
That's instaban
Ooooh.
:>
Minnet: set my location to Northern Norway.
Understood
6INSTABAN.
Now listen
It's ok.I endured WWII.The "Moon incident" is nothing compared to that.
Both hired?
seems good enough to me.. at the moment anyway.
Yes.
You both need to start thinking like mods, not viewers. That's the biggest mistake you made in the interviews. We understand the viewers are a priority, but we have rules and we do not tolerate porn or explicit gore at all
lol
Only 3 votes on forum?
posting DE's interview to the forums and updating status
Alright.
6If something does come up, we have an appeals channel.
Ok.
I'm probably more lenient than I should be.
I thought we waited for at least a majority vote?
Me too...
You're both too passive
But
wb, Dman
We hope that we can train you
Back, erryone =D
time to ...*gulp* ...read
thanks, GGgala
Wut is it Dman?
Fair enough.
Yep
And four mods have already given consent
D:
I... don't?
whatwillIfind?
OHSHI-
6First off, pick colors. First come first served.
7Congratulations to both of you and welcome to the team
Blue.
6Which blue?
That's the last blue
Unless someone is already using it.
Huh?
12This one
6There are 3, two are in use.
Hmm.
Okay
....I DISAGREE WITH THE FIRST SENTENCE ALREADY!!!
That'll work.
12This is the only one not in use
Well I guess it was only a matter of time before you shipped with Silvermane...
uh...
Is the Grey easily readable though?
02*WB03(Kosoveon03)02WB* - <Kosovo> Don't make me Octopus you. >:/
lol okay
4The only problem is that it may be hard to make out amongst a sea of whites
Looks readable
2 months ago was YEARS before my time
Not counting Cross really giving consent.
Stands out enough to me.
I think the blue is much more easy to pick out.
ohey Dave_BroZilla
4Then go with blue
6It looks fine to me.
Finished season 1 last night...partially the reason why I couldn't make the stream
A YA! (uncle)
Right
you are evil
One more thing...
seriously
XD
*smack*
06xDDDD
14Lets see...
12And this one...
6Just know that some people complain about the darker colors, like blue.
Looks fine.
hey, I fell for it too :P
brb,gotta eat
hahahaaaa.........haha.....ha.....crap. i now gotta rewatch them. haven' seen literally since they were aired....greeeaaaat, something else to watch :P
lemme find 'em
hey guys, i gotta disconnect.
4Alright
03hm
: /
4And DE?
WE INVENT MORE
We probably won't before we split rooms.
We still have a few more.
03but eh
Lol, it just finished in Toronto
03that Magikarp I used to use is now a Gyarados
Simple
3Hows this?
6Looks fine.
WAT
4Looks good
6Better than the blue.
...
3Oh good.
6The blue blurs...
4I do believe
4That's all the colors
3Greenery it is then
14Yeah, I noticed that about the blue too.
6All righty then.
3YOU MUST BRING ME A SHRUBBARY
He's onto you!
I was asking you to try doing something like that anyway...
About the domain, or colors?
02ANGEL
/me faints
Also, anyone want me to PM them the first episode of JCA?
03so, sigh
02THISISEPIC
13?
Who...who...who wrote this...
...I don't understand
13Oh, I know right :D
Dave_BroZilla: what's that stand for?
Like a link?
You have them added to the exceptions, dari?
4Now
Not yet.
ohh
02best use of 16 minutes.
3It looks like a mosaic in here with all the colors now.
ohhh, yesplz
i can't find the first one
/me 7reveals herself out of the shadows a moment
6As soon as dari does his job... >>;
We thought it'd give the best of both worlds.
You should right away, because we should invite them in here to talk without prying eyes
:P
*gasp* Sathi!
14lol
!fart
Sathi: awesome! can't wait for it, don't worry about it
Only 1 minute posting limit?

>prying eyes
Boss
>you can see when people join :P
But they can't see the room itself
I dunno, depends.
: /
7I own all dvd's

Don't the DVD's have scenes cut though?
02I NEED MOAR OF THIS

Do you remember any IRC commands?
0PMV*
14I may have to look them up. Unless you wanna throw some at me.
inb4 Hate
I'm all for mods using mIRC (or another proper client) instead of mibbit by the way. :P
14Though I seen to have more options when I use mIRC than this.
It's...A Map
0ON EqD NOW BRB
14Yeah, I got on here on mIRC last night to check it out.
7Dari
oh I need that map
7if you help me use colours
14And re-familiarize myself with it.
I can set you up with a colour script.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT SHE SUCKS,I JUST SAID THAT I HATE HER.
7that be great
I'm sorry.
/me is just fine using IRC
Mibbit != IRC
is that acceptable?
Mibbit == IRC client
:P
mIRC == IRC client
14I've never used "Mibbit" before here.
WUBUBUBUBU
Well, mibbit is using the term client loosely.
6As long as you're keeping things positive.
FFFFFFFUUUUUU-
6Negativity starts mudfests.
14I've only used mIRC in the past.
Mibbit's a web application, IE crap.
6We dislike mudfests.
...lolwut. saying ana imaginary pony sucks is against the rules?
/me 7is preparing to stream in a bit
It's the best web client though.
yay~
14It seems okay overall.
in before the genius asshole, and 'house is baws'
14Wheres the bold options and such?
On mibbit? No idea.

10Sprinkles has defended my honour in my absence. I thank thee.

Hi, all
4And why was Dman brought up?

There, now it's done
0lulz script
hi J
hi again xD
6He was a moment ago.
6He just left.
4Oh dear
4WELP
10also, Dman had something to ask, you say?
yes
4Unless he begins emoting more and more
6I am not.
Seriously, stop this shit about Dman now. :/
Something happened to Dman.
J~
hi
hi Kos!
4True...but Dman never comes to us
4Ever
This one is awesome.
6I know.
4So I guess he feels he can escape the ire of the senior mods?
6I'm not even kidding.
6It's annoying.
4Yes it is
aboot
French verse is best verse.
6And it's disobeying the mods, which is clearly against the rules.
4True, it is
He hasn't done anything right now.
J'vais dire une phrase en francais parce's'kicit on es blingue.THERE I SAID IT.I'M BLINGUAL.
Seems hypocritical to me.
4u mad?
6I can't address him.
6He's not online.
6Or else I would.
4And, again, he's going behind our backs
4When he should be addressing his concerns to us
dat Rarity
He doesn't HAVE to talk to you.
6I didn't even realize he was online until he was just online.
dat Twilight
4His concerns are our concerns, especially when it concerns mods
dat foreshadowing
dat Morrowind done installing
DAT IZ A LOT OF BEE
dat Spike
dat Celestia
DUDUN
4Oh
4trust me
VAGINA
4I'll tell him
4When he actually confronts us
6I'm not throwing shit at him.
I WANT MY REQUEST PLZ.
4Also
BITCHY
Ok
6I've stated this many, many times.
It's just i'm impatient.
4Because we haven't actually told him yet
6I'll hand it over after this vid, Sathi.
7sure i'll start setting up
4Um...we're planning?
Best part of my day
10As long as it's not dari streaming
10I'm ok with this
4To tell him that he's not getting the position
10AllisZero. You're a hero
:P
7did you record it?
And would have told him.
4Look
This conversation didn't start about telling him he's not getting mod.
6As long as it's done in a professional manner.
6...which he was.
You guys keep talking about professionalism, from where I'm standing, I'm not seeing much of it.
4I'm astounded that you see absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that Dman clearly went out of his way to not voice his concerns to the mods he's supposed to voice his concerns to
4Your obtuseness quite honestly blinds me
Hi
lol where are you again, Sathi?
7netherlands
Oh that's right, you're in the GMT zone

14Think its near $200 now. Last time I checked anyway.
I like detail, though, Silvermane. I'm just thinking it might be too much work.
well, if you make it once, you should be able to duplicate with less effort, correct?
14A plushie? Yeah. You should have a pattern to follow to make more.
Yeah, that's very much correct.
lol
14Haha
6That just happened earlier.
14Thats how I am in the restroom too.
6Like a half hour ago.

Brushables only works when they do the hair RIGHT in the first place
Sathi, I'm reminded of Hoity-Toity when you said Take II
Dash's hair doesn't look right with brushables.

Can't wait for the thread on a forum I go to to explode
again
and the sexiness of the mod's voices were compared
lol, how did that go GGgala_ ?
awful quality at first, in and out
then it settled
weird-ass distortions
14My call kept getting dropped. After the 4th time I just gave up. :P
14lol Thanks. I can't stream right now unfortunately. My bandwidth is a bit lacking. But maybe after I move in a bit.

Nope.avi guys. it's "[The DARI. A unit of measurement adapted to the assessment of the effect of low-dose radiation]. "

speaking of wookies Daz, i dare you to watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43CBki2BVE
{1,0You0,4Tube}: "DJO - Fish Cream" - "Ooops - 2nd upload - had to fix some stuffffffff. It&#39;s all Mike&#39;s fault. Made possible by a grant from Mothers Against Light. Not responsible for lost or sto..."
it's...alright
14Oh, those guys.
oooh. *reads*
14Earlyish too kinda.
; )

14Grr, another person posing as me. Too many Octvias!
14*Octavias
lol
haha
orly
14Guess "Octavia" wasnt as creative as I thought it was...
14Well, I liked it anyway. Seems others were thinking the exact same thing. :P
14Indeed.
14And I should voice her. Lmao. I can dream. :P
I'm off for about 1 hour (daily run :P) Goodbie all =]
cya Daz, have a good run
14If they rename her, I'll be sad.
14Laters, Daz
14Mhm.
14Though like Derpy, I derp a lot too. :P
I GO!
14lol Later
I hate when i start rendering, only to find out i forgot to disable an object that was in the way of the render, resulting in me having to start over
14Ouch.
14Perhaps. lol
14I'm still a little nervous. :P
14I did talk slightly on Skype earlier.
Aww.
I don't think I heard you.
14I know one or two did for a second. I know it dropped it in the middle of one time I was talking.
14I think I said maybe 3 or 4 things the entire time. :P
14I really hate my voice though.
14Need to work on it more.
I usually find when people complain about a quality of theirs, there's nothing wrong with it.
Especially women. :P
?
He says he has a terrible voice, and if you listen to the Q&Neigh podcast, you'll find that that's actually pretty accurate.

10GGgala I think you may have cracked the formula
10I wean them onto ponies when they're at their weakest
mfw we all watch ep1 and its a cliffhanger
we lose ya, Dz?
we lose ya, Daz*?
I think I'm gonna install Sacred again...
GGgala_: for my mind :3
Yeah, tell me about it...
10mind_of_daz mfw you genuinely think there's more bad to good surrounding using alcohol as a stimulant O.o
LEVERAGE
10it's fucking awesome.
10Well it seems pretty un-joke-like to me, since you keep saying it ;D
alcohol lowers heartpulse (possibly extending life) makes u use enzymes not used as much, and processes not used much in body = healthier body etc etc. i'm sure theres a shitton of other positives, but i cba to remember
i had 4 beers y/day yay~
10s'all about the fun
i'm interested
lol GGgala_
10daz I don't really drink beer, and it really depends on my mood, since if I'm happier I drink faster
10but if I drink quickly, I'm a bit of a lightweight. But I can drink a lot of alcohol and keep drinking and not be sick :3
Tried to do Pinkie's hair, but failed... Need to get hairpins
not be sick, but get tingly? high / low tolerance would you say?
10@daz I said I'm a bit of a lightweight
10:P
Am I strange for wanting the not-mane-character brushables?
I kinda want to catch 'em all, now...
I'll take that as a compliment, then
GGgala_: would you say it was http://fondosdibujosanimados.com.es/images/wallpapers/jack-sparrow-908463.jpeg the opportune moment?
OPPORTUNE
Even if he can't diggy diggy hole, he can BLOW holes into shit

His mine drops are f'in awesome when you're overwhelmed by enemies and have to run
Daz: OH U
10daz implying being hyper even touches being drunk in the slightest :D The majority of my ridiculous stories are based on drunkenness
Yes.Yogscast joke.
lol
10anyway, shower time
10daz I completely do not understand the 2nd half of that post
10is it in swahili?
i have 2 other ways i have fun that i think are as good as being drunk
...u trollan meh?
10Yeah, staying up is great, but it's not really as repeatable :P
10imo daz they're both a little random, and not exactly plausible in all social situations
not social at all, that's why you go and drink :3 :3

There's a SoarinCaramel fic on EqD.

Stream's weird to me as well
like it stutters and freezes
kicks me off completely sometimes
7taking a peek
Same here
7restarting

Tried refreshing several times
It doesn't help at all
It does, but then it goes back to freezing.

That random OC looks like he had fun at the pond
7and it's pretty darn good
MIGHT be another Hugh
Oh yeah, Hugh Laurie is awesome
I'm betting that's him playing piano
7it's him singing
Also
Well that I know :P
DEM CRAZY WINGS!
but he's awesome on the piano, too
He's also an amateur juggler, like me
Did anything happen when i was gone?
/me 7is gonna have a hard time to find the point where we were a moment ago
these splotchy ponies look awful
How's it going MirthTinker?
..mine looked like he had the picture of a nebula as skin
and insect eyes
The Soarin/Caramel one is good.
yeah, Sathi
or for me it does
7HMMZ
14Huh, odd. Its working fine for me.
7brb kicking my boyfriend
7:P

Did anything happen to you recently MirthTinker?
My eyes are bleeding from the random I got
Oh man, I randomized again, and this one is even worse
Ya all ready?
You broke the rules, Edward!
Well MirthTinker,ReticentSmolder said something earlier that i didn't quite get.

/me follows in the facehooving
Also, timezones confuse me
14Indeed.
14Timezones confuse him.
14Sounds like an excuse to me.
I tried checking with a Timezone converter, but it said that the interview wouldn't be until in another hour
a bad one to me
hehe
Must've picked the wrong timezone
Why are we rescheduling? Isn't he the last one of today?
wasnt there a 3:30 interview already?
exactly
/me dodges
My bad then. Nvm me, I'll just be a moron over here in the corner.
14lol You're fine CB.
What's that in GMT?
Because I don't want to make the same mistake
Jack Layton passed away. :(
>cries
Yeah.I heard it too.
14:P
14Here, have a pony!
Jack Layton was a really good person.

exactly my thoughts
14Eh, it doesn't show up well for him, thats for sure.
17:30 my time, I'm availible
No wait... 18:30
14He may just be genuinely ignorant to these types of things. Timezones used to confuse me too a bit.
its not exactly a dealbreaker, but something to consider
Where do you live?
is he going to show up to events on time?
Sweden, GMT +1
notsurehowtofeelsicneidontknowwhoitis.jpg
Well it's 3:40 PM eastern now

14If you're not good with things like timezones.
whoa, !!Applejack is back on ponychan
Are we repeating the episodes from yesterday?
/me 's head explodes
Hello.
First of all excuses for the delay.
Do you have any questions before we start?
Ok.
OHSHI-
No i'm good
7How did you hear about us?
Through a fellow friend of mine named Sathi.
7Oh I know her!
Moochick is now best chick.
I think its around 7 or 8 by now, memory is a tad fuzzy.
7What do you like most about our movienights?
14We kinda figured that out, yes. :P
Stream really not working well for me... oh well
Time for some sea ponies
7I see, is there anything you dislike?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
10I'm not watching the stream atm, EGIdrA is streaming (starcraft 2 player) <3
7Do you have any experience with moderating?
10soso mad
Sorry about the delay
got disturbed
I have previous experience with moderating
7Can you specify that?
Several web forums and a few IRC chatrooms
This is hilariously ridiculous... rofl
my times would be for weekdays durign the evening between 10pm to perhaps 2 or 3am. as for weekends I would have more or less full availabillity unless something comes up.
7I see
7What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
dat division rank on the SC2 stream
LASER
10he roflpwnd some 'toss players earlier
10that was amusing
10http://www.twitch.tv/eg_idra
<3
7Any other ideas?
14Hah
you should see his work
14He seems capable.
14Oh Sathi?
i'll show you in a bit
/me is intrigued
http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-1311252959133.jpg?w=640
...wow
thats really good
14Not bad.
He draws ponies. Hire this man.
14Braeburn.<3
7Can you link us some recent work?
14He mentioned a banner.
14I was thinking the same thing.
y u haet me, stream?
Y u hate me as well stream?
we are going to need banners for the rooms once we get the site set up
he made that
having a graphic designer would be a HUGE plus
i saw the pic you just posted, but nothing before that
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pbwb6btGiI

Yes, it is...
How is it suggestive?
7Any ideas about our site in it's currents form?
frankly, i'm not mean enough to break such innocence
That's not suggestive at all.
he tried to draw one of my cats
but eventually gave up
http://notharam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/wpid-dsc00120.jpg?w=640
too much furr
GODDAMNIT NAMCO STOP KILLING MY CHILDHOOD.
The layout itself is quite neat actually, I would say it needs a touch of paint giving the viewers an even more enjoyable experience with the site.
no, it's just exposure. Suggestive material implies sex and sexual behaior
oh
OHSHI-
that looks really good imo
lol Pizzapony is still logged in?
PizzaPony is in here?

OH MY FUCK IT'S SEA PONIES

OHSHI-

7finishing up some things
7give me a moment
Vol 4
hmm... i think i should read through some of the comps
Most of them are amazing
even if they are in 2nd person, which I dislike a little bit
yfw I'm responsible for all the rape and sex-shipping on this sie
site*
Are you guys watching the stream?
YOU BASTARD
14Listening to it.
:P
14lol
Most of them are honestly about romance, not sex
which is why I like them
cat there
they only put like one 'Woah!' story in each, right?
Yeah, one or two
7http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
Even those aren't overly explicit though
there is either a fox or a cat on my screen
14Aww, kitty.
14Happily perched on his post. :P
Hip how you feel about him?
i like him
you said you know him, right?
7That was the last part of the interview
7Do you have anything to add?
yep I do
D'AWWWWWWWW
KITTEHS ARE CUTE
7Wait a moment please
I think personally he would be a great addition with his abilities
Well, definitely not G3.5, that's for sure...
Hideous hellbeasts
i would say a definite yes in that case
want to do it straight away or want to let the other mods vote first?
inb4 Rainbow Dash always dresses in style
he nailed the pics for the most part, he can do graphic design, and he has a personal recommendation from you, thats enough for me to say yes
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
uh, how many were here when we hired the others?
/me always dresses in Rainbow Dash
I don't know, probably something dirty :P
