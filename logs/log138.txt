Dont copy that flopy
And maybe always-on systems.
"Having fired these encouraging salvos at the gaming community, Kotick then switched his targets to console manufacturers, who he seems intent on putting out of business by "untethering" Activision games from other-party hardware. "I think what the untethered Guitar Hero does is equal the playing field a little more and give you some leverage with first parties when it comes to downloadable content and the business model.""
LEVERAGE
DFSAPLFKASD:LFAKSD:FLASKDGLA:DFGH
HE WANTS LEVERAGE
HE WANTS IT NOW
06,15always-on systems would be really bad, but I doubt most companies will use it.
dari, can I set mode +kb on Kotick, please?
06,15DRM has been there since the NES, so that I don't really worry about too much. :P
Some companies love Always-on.
06,15for consoles, though?
*cough*ubisoft*cough*
Lawl Diftraku.
ID and Tripwire have said that they supported always-on DRM.
06,15I have no doubts Activision is looking into it, but eh...
06,15Realistically, what Activision games are worth getting? :P
SecuROM is a piece of shit rootkit that deserves to be annihilated from orbit
It's no better than the viral/trojan rootkits out there
I support Diftraku in that.
BACK
:D
06,15If one of the big three would allow always-on on disc-based games, just watch the people flood over to the other two...
RP: Buy Call of Duty. It's the /only/ thing Activision has going for them.
Done buy call of duty
dont
06,15I have CoD4, it's pretty good.
Steamworks, well it works when Steam doesn't crash or disconnect
CoD4 campaign.
I stopped palying after WAW (5)
I love it.
I loved CoD 4.
06,15Yeah I don't play CoD online...
I've never played 3 or 6.
5 was the last of the orginal COD franchise
06,15Campaign is great though
I've played some online.
The pack of dogs was the best thing ever.
That was so awesome. XD
Mw2 is a mess.
MW2 I like as well.
06,15well.... part of it is great
I was a fan of Call of duty since it came out, its sad to see it go down the tube, I hate ti now
06,15There's a fairly long section that I found kinda awful
I had both MW1 and 2
I love the older ones. More story-driven.
same
Campaign was too short, though special ops was fun
Now it's all MP.
06,15CoD4 had an amazing ending though.
I took them both to the store after I finished the campaign that was piece of crap
MW2 I liked the multiplayer.
exaclty, and MW3 wont have anything Black ops did
Because SnD, quickscopes.
multiplayer wise
And I suck at MP so I don't care about it.
It was fun, I can't deny.
the only reason why COD stays in business is because people buy it hoping to be good
but even whens its not, its doesnt matter becasue they already bought it
And it's hyped to hell every year.
Black Ops, I REALLY disliked the MP.
Campaign was average.
06,15I feel kinda like a fanboy for saying Killzone is my favorite FPS series :P
I remember back with 2 and 3 when it was 2 or 3 years before one came out
Zombies was fun.
THOSE WAS DIFFERENT TIMES
WERE*
zombies is kinda fun although the new maps are very outlandish
06,15KZ2 has the dumbest plot in the history of the world, though.
I remember that one SNES game. . .Zombies ate my Neighbor?
All FPSs are going MP-centric.
Flaria: LOL
I don't follow the franchises I used to anymore.
I switched to PC slowly, becasue consoles suck now, to many FPS games
Like GoW, Halo, or Resistance.
06,15All shooters in general, not just FPS games
Too damn expensive to anyway.
06,15Lots of TPS games going more MP centric, too.
I prefer my FPS gaming on a PC. I like the finer control the mouse gives over the dual analog style that most console FPSs use.
^ I agree
Timesplitters FTW
I don't have a preference.
I loved Timesplitters.
the PC has a MUCH WIDER selection of games though too
Especially #2.
TIMESPLITTERS
06,15I prefer my FPS games with motion controls, lolololol
Fuck YES
LOLOLOL
TROLOLOLLLLLLLL
06,15Dead serious, actually :P
/me is listening to Anaconda at the moment
Metroid Prime 3, RobotPinkie?
INB4 I have to dig out my Timesplitters game, and replay them all on my PS2 now.
06,15That's what convinced me it was a good idea, EspyLacopa
lol I did that oevr someone elses house becasue i dont have a PS2 anymore, was quite fun
06,15KZ3 pretty much cemented it.
RobotPinkie, EspyLacopa: MP:3. <3
2 MORE DAYS!
then 2 weeks >..>
I'm out bronies~
FPSs on Wii.
Eugh.
06,15Later, Zephirdd
night night
One of these days, I need to snag the trio pack of MP 1-3 for the Wii.
NOT WANT
/me hugs Zephirdd goodnight
Sleep well :3
06,15Most have really shit controls...
/me hugs bronystate :3
/me hugs Flaria in response <3
farewell Zephirdd
oops spelling erropr
BUT YOU GET TEH POINT C:
Shitty controls in any game is a sign of bad or no testing.
06,15Same on PS3, unfortunately... I don't get it, like couldn't they just give all the code for controls to developers?
Shitty controls are hardly restricted to the Wii.
06,15Sony clearly has code for well done FPS controls with Move, so why do third party developers just suck at it?
itc: games suck but we still play them anyways
Meh move.
/me hugs ctrlx
Hiya, you.
Move is a wiimote with a flashing bobble on top.
I dont like how there trying to force Motion Control on us, Just like 3D, I HATE 3D and grenades but thats another story'
06,15I love motion controls when done right, though.
true true
06,15That goes for both Wii motion + and Move
flaria, hiya :3/
also, my contribution to the discussion: PC PWNS
lol so true
just its expensive to upkeep
@pwnymeter ctrlx
School's out! Time for Ponies! How's it going everypony?
06,15I like pretty much all formats, I just don't have a very good PC...
awe :<
Hiya SuperBrony64
Hi SuperBrony64
For me, motion controls are a great idea.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=294
pc cost about the same since games and other stuff is soooo easy to pirate for
although 360 isn't hard either
Nintendo were really pretty innovative and interesting (as always).
But they just don't work.
and wii is just pathetically easy
At least the 3DS isn't as bad as the Virtual Boy.
They seem like a great idea, pretty much everyone bought a wii.
And the Wii's motion control is far superior to the Power Glove.
But nearly everyone I know who has one doesn't use it any more.
06,15Pffft, motion controls work great in the right games.
It was kind of just a novelty thing.
It's worn off.
i'd rather have surround view
/me <3 Nintendo
I still use mine. :/
that's more imersive than motion sensing
Motion Control and 3D video is hardly a new idea though.
Back to the ole Virtual Boy debate huh?
Hey guys,
06,15lawl, Virtual Boy debate.
Hey Flutterguy
What's there to debate?
Look at what I just found.
06,15There were 3D graphics in the 80's, too :P
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/113229-SCOTUS-To-Blame-For-Sonys-Terms-of-Service-Changes
Everypony WHO'S ANYPONY knows the Virtual Boy was the god among video game consoles that got killed off before its time.
There were 3D graphics in ye olde black and white photography.
#D goes back to the beginning of time.
3D*
there were color Televisions back when it was invented!
but oh well
06,15Not sure a singularity would count as "3D", Dashite :P
You mean 0D
RobotPinkie, maybe. Maybe. :p
. = 0D. - = 1D. Shape = 2D.
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/stereoscopic1903b.jpg <-- Ye Olde 3D
06,15I like 3D, I like motion controls... I know that among gamers that usually means I'm in the minority, but eh...
Technology doesn't just come out of thin air like at an Apple keynote. There are a lot of technologies that are fully developed but haven't become cost-effective enough for the consumer market.
Even if the game wasn't great, Conduit still has the best FPS controls on console.
Dashite: I agree with this statement lol
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/streets1903.jpg <-- Have some more Ye Olde 3D.
I take 3D to mean like 3D films.
Ye Olde 3D?
SuperBrony64 and they put all the sliders in the options menu so you could fine tune it to your preference!
yay stereograms!
What do you mean by 3D games, I'd guess not games that require 3D glasses?
You mean flat 3D games? XD
The biggest flaw with 3D films is how they choose the focus the action.
06,15I like 3DTV, lets put it that way.
the biggest flaw is that there are really only two depths
I don't like 3D films.
Big example off the top of my head is Avatar.
near and far
I hate the focus thing!
I think the 3D adds nothing.
06,15I think it's generally pointless for movies, though
And all it DOES do is screw up the colour/quality of the film
06,15For games, it does add quite a bit
i think it adds something. but it's just not enough
3D movies give me headaches. :/
games it does add more
I won't be impressed with 3D movies until it's fully holographic to the point where you can put the audience in a full 360 degree ring around the hologram.
For example, if you remember those seedâ€¦things, that float around all the time, they are extremely out of focus while the background is in focus (as to where the action is).
Kinda like a small stadium.
06,15For ponies, I don't think 3D would add anything.
Wherein movies will actually be a bit like a far more impressive form of Theatre.
I know exactly what you mean SuperBrony64. And when you try to look at them and they don't come into focus and it screws with your eyes. >_<
Good night everyone.
Good night Dari
Anyway, I think 3D adds a lot of effect to movies/games. It isn't REQUIRED, but it certainly makes a movie more appealing for me.
Eugh 3d
I dont like 3D
/me is gone
I don't mind 3D..
It screws up my eyes
06,15I think it's mostly for games, really... Much easier to see where you're jumping exactly, or where everything is.
usually strains them, then I cant see 2 feet in front of me for probably about 4 hours
RobotPinkie: My favorite use of 3D haha.
That really sucks Randall1160
lol
Worse than the headaches I get. :p
my eyes are normally fine, but 3D
UGH
Super Mario 3D Land is really bringing that aspect as a core gameplay mechanic.
Discussion on 4chan brightened up my day.
4chan? O_____O
AllisZero: Topic?
Anonymous 09/22/11(Thu)20:42:33 No.354786373 How can ships travel at warp speed without crashing into planets and asteroids?
What discussion, AllisZero

I go by the rule that everything that ends in chan is bad news
excepy for jackie chan
AllisZero: Haha, exactly.
hes col
cool*
06,15lawl, AllisZero
We need a Jackie Chan movie.
Hahaha
Except, at least in Star Wars, they calculate a route before going into Light Speed.
Dashite: Little Big General?
Flaria, haven't seen that one.
Err, Little Big Soldier*.
The thread quickly derailed into trolling everywhere
also, inb4copyrightinfringement
But that comment made me lol pretty hard
lol didn't Einstein prove that moving faster that light is impossible for humans to survive?
Copyright infringement.
then*
If I had the money to buy a 3DTV, I'd instead use that money to get a kickass new computer and two widescreen TV/Monitors.
^ YEA BUDDY
Dashite: It's pretty recent, 2010 I think
Einstein proved it was impossible to travel faster than light...
Which seems to have been disproven lately
O rly?
Randall1160: Actually, he proved that nothing can ACCELERATE to the speed of light.
06,15I'm only going to buy 3DTV once it's cheap enough...
Flaria, Little Big Soldier says IMDB.
thats what I thought, thanks for the confirmation
wasnt sure sooo
RobotPinkie Until then, long live 3 monitors+Crossfire/SLI :D
RobotPinkie: Why not go for the new Playstation monitor that's $499?
thats why I dont get why they still use it in movies and game and such
Dashite: I corrected myself :<
06,15Because it's so small, SuperBrony64 :(
Oh, I missed the correction... I wasn't highlighted in green. >_>
It*
RobotPinkie: True, but, for me, it's a perfectly fine size.
Maybe add in a new desk + chair to go with awesome new computer and dual monitor setup.
Flutterguy: I'm actually thinking of going AMD with my next build/GPU if NVidia doesn't come up with something similar to the whole multiple display thing
I just signed up for the World of planes beta
SO PUMPED
G'night, I'm off to hit the hay
and for MLP ina few
Good night Diftraku
Cya Diftrak

Sleep well!

Night Diftraku

AllisZero, you mean like nVidia Surround? I think that's what they called it atleast...
Watching last minutes of Titan A.E. on livestream first
but anyhoof, later
Night Diftraku
Titan AE, fuck yeah! Awesome movie!

O RLY?
Dancing Ponies?! *runs off*

GOOD NIGHT TO ALL THOSE THAT ARE LEAVING
Good night RP

SuperBrony64 true story :(
Good night everypony
night all who are leaving
/me hugs RobotPinkie and AllisZero goodnight
YOU ALL STILL HAVE ZOIDBERG!
Sleep well, you two :3
AllisZero, I think the major difference is that Surround requires SLI, while Eyefinity just requires a 6xxx card.
Good night to everypony thats leaving ! (O_O)/" RFAREWELL AVRIOUR or whatever that thing is
There, there little one. Good as new! *combusts*
You know what's upsetting? The gap between Episode 2 and Episode 3 :/

Haha, I hope that wasn't a SEASON 2 SPOILER :P

EspyLacopa: I've been using that for a while now :3

On occasion, you'll catch some obscure streams during the week, like Let's Play-esque videos and sometimes a YouTube trip
Okayâ€¦so far I've got the Door, Fire, and Dress...
Yes, like Luna playing Serious Sam, or DCD playing Super Robot Wars.
Anyone else played Rogue Galaxy?
EspyLacopa: Not me, but I've heard of it.
Rogue Galaxy? Star Wars?
Game for the PS2, made by the same people that did Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2.
No, I haven't..
So yeah, just finished the storybookâ€¦definitely some plot holes there.
And character identification issues...
But for the most part, worth $0.99.

So how were your days?
Ehh.
I got an exam back. I could've done better, but I was sleepy ;~;
Aw, sorry to hear.
:(
I took a quiz today in Thermodynamics.
Butâ€¦I hope I did well on it :P
Otherwise my parents say "NO PONIES FOR A MONTH"
:P
I'm sure you did fine.
I don't start school for another 2 weeks though :)
>_>;
Lucky.
I've been on the quarter system up until now
Same here. I'll be in the quarter system.
If I still was, I'd be having midterms next week, but instead we're going over the same stuff we did two weeks ago...
/me sighs
Damned semesters.
Damn kids =p
Damn world?
/me shrugs
No was just amusing my self you all have school complants still.
I've finished 4- FOUR!- 600+ page books
And done my homework
I miss quarters. T^T
Wow..
Wish I could just read a book and be done with the day :P
Also, that's a standard lunch break to Twilight Sparkle :P
I haven't been in a quarter system in years.
Since grade school.
So used to semesters now.
I've never had a quarter system.
I have huge breaks in between classes...
Also glad I'm not taking classes.
The amount of coding and data production I've done over the past 3 weeks is amazing.
I can just sit there and read for three hours, go to a class, get out and do homework/study for three hours, go to another class, go back to reading....
I was in semesters throughout grade school. College I'm going to will be quarter system..
Nittany, coding and data production for what?
My thesis.
o_o;
What major?
Meteorology.
Really interesting
Coding for Meteorology? How does that work?
I'm doing coding so I can process data and create graphs easily.
For my topic.
Which is lightning climatology.
The streaming embeds working on this site again yet?
Oh.
Sounds cool, Nittany_Tiger! :3
I actually used GIMP a bit to make an animation showing the flash density oscillations throughout the day.
I should say changes.
It is cool.
Guys, check out my latest piece of work:
Army of monochrome, nice
Dont know what that means but thanks ^^
Lookin good.
Army of black and white she means? And shades of grey.
Oooh

[23:55:47]	|<--	Trollestia has left irc.ponychat.net (*.net *.split)
well that was a random wall to tab back and see
so anypony here rewritten songs to reflect MLP?
er.
nope.jpg
rewritten lyrics?
ive rewritten one song's lyrics.
good night everypony
good night
Didn't even think about it.
And good night to you.
G'morning
Oh lawl
yeah... huh
net splits, lovely
good morning XD
so what 'choo doin' t'day?
i might take a car in for an oil change...
Dunno
Might buy some booze
Been about few weeks without due to meds
Silly Pneumonia and stuff
darn.
feeling better then?
yeah, still got some dry cough tho
Having a check up next month
They're taking the lung x-rays again
well i wish you a good recovery
How'd you get pneumonia?
I have no idea
It's quite nasty the one I got
Oh, well I hope you're feeling better soon!
Hiya Dif.
I had my CRP spiking at 217
/me hugs Diftraku, hoping he gets better soon
Ohai Natleyn
/me returns the hug to Natleyn
When you'd normally expect to have it around under 10
D:
The doc was quite insistive on admitting to hospital the same day they had the second set of blood tests done
It was quite fun having 4 blood tests in one week...
The ironic thing is, I've been almost all summer on antibiotes
I had a serious inflammation in my leg but it was spotted early on
So yeah, I might need to start living in a bubble xD
o_o;
Anyhoof, me aside, how's everypony?
ok
Can't complain.. aside from illness, how about you?
Pulled an overnighter
Sleepy.
Annoyed at and loving animating this stupid cursor.
Somepony was streaming Titan A.E. and Iron Giant so why not :P
(Over on livestream)
No way.
Whenever I think about going sleeping at 6AM, I always remind myself with http://i.derpy.me/pUn5a.png
<3
Lol
/me is really a more night time person
I stayed up til 6 this morning.. and I was thinking the same thing right before I went to bed.
I'd go gaze at the moon, but clouds. -.-
/me likes the night.
Amen to that, the night is where it's at :D
*yawn*
I like the clouds
/me shakes fist in the air and mumbles "One day... I will wake up early to just watch the sunrise"
/me is usually up at sunup to hunt.
ffffffff
I dunno what to dooo..
Find the closest person who you can do stuff to without bothering them too much, in or out of chat
Pat them on the head eight times.
Leave without saying a word.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAbRIXBTII
Oldie but goodie
Everybody's asleep though.. :/
Well thanks ALOT Diftraku, now you made my heart implode and then explode.
Mine did so many times
Diftraku: That MIGHT'VE actually worked, had I not played Yoshi's Island religiously as a child
:3
But
It's still d'awwwww
/me hugs Diftraku
D'awww and nostalgia~
It's still very dawwww
Yikes
Huh?
Laptop keyboard malfunctioned.
Didn't think it was you.
Doing that, I mean.
No.
I spilled milk on my laptop keyboard, permanently ruining it.
I know.
Well, my laptop keyboard seems to have developed a mind of its own.
Lemme try to disable it.
So it won't eeeeee spam.
Oh!
I thought you were watching Po pi po or something
wait the eeeeee spam was't intended?
Goodnight, #bronystate! :3
/me hugs #bronystate
/me hugs Flaria (good night!)
Night.
Sleep well!
Night Flaria
Also, can't disable keyboard via software. I'll have to open it up and pull the plug out. May or may not bother.
``
Sorry, can't type today at all. :/

See ya Revolver
And actually, I'm going too.. so bye everyone.

Well all I can say it's better then I could do so works for me.
OMG GUYS

NO

/me takes the santa hat off his pinkie pie plush
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hz7s8FDyzM&feature=related
Nah, Pinkie can have the hat. She disregards the fourth wall anyway.
but why was tehre a santa costume in taht one shot?
Because she's Pinkie. She ain't gotta explain shit.
a non-denominational gift giving holliday would work
they have gifts under apple trees :D
Nah. Too politically correct.
fine how about cellestia's birthday?
New year's?
they know the exact day of the big bang?
sumica, cellestia kept track
oh right, good point
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elCj-Y97neI <3
and luna was born a day later, when cellestia had to poop
/me throws a wrench in everything
oh man i really have to pee
oh and for reffrence to the outfit.

It's a Fox News debate at that.
/me might try writefagging to alleviate the boredom.
Oops. Wrong channel.
lawl
Mentioning a live Republican candidate debate on YT sponsored by Fox News.
oh boy. i love comedy!
Lol.
Fox news the only station where I have the urge to take a folding chair to the back of each of there heads.
whoah whoah whoah
One candidate was talking about how he survived colon cancer (stage 4) only because of privatized health care.
why am i using 5.3gb of ram
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
Nittany_Tiger, and i bet he HAD MONEY FOR IT
Because he could get timely treatment.
My reaction to FOX.
Exactly.
He didn't have to have fun with insurance because he could pay for it out-of-pocket.
Trollestia, that'd make a good youtube video. clips of fox people talking but audioswap with scat singing
people might not notice the difference though
True.
Kudos for beating cancer, but don't say that you beat cancer because you wouldn't get timely care under govt. health care when you got it only because you didn't have to deal with insurance.
lol my firefox is using 1.4gb of ram
:3c
less tab browsing
Sumica, i also have it set to cache in ram
ssd so i try to reduce writes as much as possible
oddly enough, i only have 23 tabs in one window and 2 youtube videos in another
ah well yeah that will do it.
still haven't seen it that high before. i've probably had the actuall program open for a few days now
oh wait. one tab is that reactional image thread on ponychan
that one around 2 miles long?
yah
still using a shitload of ram though when down to 3 tabs. i'd say it's from having the program open forever
/me enjoys having a mechanical storage drive.
one tab. just under a gig
Trollestia, i have 5 of those
/me enjoys having an SSD
/me doesn't worry about writes.
Diftraku, i have one of those. gonna get another
Trollestia, nah you just gotta worry about magnets
ctrlx: Same, I'll even get one for my laptop once I buy one
Used them when I did drafting, did't see the need for personal use.
>implying a magnet will ever get within 10m of my computer
Trollestia, and G forces
I actually have power magnets in 3m radius of my pc
My computer doesn't move.
although when i was in a car accident where hte truck rolled 5 times at 80mph my computer was lolejected and it ran fine
neodymiym or wotsit called
4x80gb raid0 array booted up just fine
:P
i'm still using two of hte 80's
seagate ftw
I might actually invest in a raid
i'm a raid freak
I think all of my HDDs are seagate
if i get another ssd then the only drive not in raid will be my 2tb
/me has built a few computers in my time, but doesn't know what you're talking about.
Trollestia, just think of sli for hard drives
or
two drives have the same thing on both (incase one fails)
Redundancy <3
or if you have many you can do a combination of those
i just run raid0 because i love living on the edge
putting 1.6v through a cpu doesn't phase me
get it? phase
oh ho ho
*rimshot*
that was so fucking stupid
i'm gonna put that on g+
yah firefox only uses 150mb when first loaded up
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40O46H1Td-A
they do some strange things with [MMD]
Indeed.
i like it
did't know they had compatitions for it now.
this one amused me http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YrzwQZuQnc
i like the part where he makes the car noises
indeed that is the best part
they reay put way too much effor in to that screw attack video.
which one?
http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/rainbow-dash-vs-starscream-at.html
Sumica: that was awesome
Awsome yes, realy did't not expect them to go that far for the video though.
that's only mugen though, right?
Not sure if they used Mugen or if they animated it them selves.
gonna reset my network on the off chance that they managed to procces my speed change early.
Would love to say I am supprised, but I am not.
/me is going to need a new hard drive solely for ponies at this rate.
Trollestia, 2tb's are cheap now
and gnite <3
Night.
Night Trollestia
Sumica: You misunderstand.
Noting new
It's morning.
and yes I see it was ctrlx
k then
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM
Hmmâ€¦did I miss anything?
There must be a least one pony still around to talk...
So what's today's movie line-up?
Batman and some other movie I forgot
Which batman?
Begins?
Not sure
Sec
Well, suppose it's something like that
They showed Dark Knight a few weeks back, or so I recall
00:07:45 < RobotPinkie> Batman Begins + Babes in Toyland
Yay for irssi idling
Babes in the what now?
Toyland
It's the B-movie obv :P
I get it, but, what
Probably some retarded flick with some blondes acting like idiots in some magical land?
Probs
hihihihihihi
Hohohohohohoh
hihihihihihihi
Giggling at the ghostie, are you?
it's off to work we go
after pondering "Hohohohohohoh" i was like notsureifsetup.jpg
but nah i was just saying hi lol
ok
just don't forget GOBLINS! GOBLINS all around!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCiyb2xvAh8
Goblins?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7zTUIYQVpY <-- Goblins?
i didn't make out very much of that lol
This land is made of LOVE AND PEACE! --> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnzLwuYToCQ
love stampede!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWcCskvU3vE <-- Heh
lol you know it's true
yet in many games you WILL be split up somewhere.. that's where things usually get fun
Gotta keep your eye on that thief though.
lol ya except for some games
well most i've played probably don't have the thief actually screwing things up for everyone
AFTER he joins you anyway
tomorrow is gonna be awesome.. funday monday? more like funday saturday amirite?
:D
'Tis success. :)
Silly MeteorVenture, tomorrow is Saturday.
lol do you watch any day[9]?
he's a starcraft commentator
he has does this thing called funday monday and basically on that day people who actually care about that do whatever he tells them to do on that day.. for instance "kill people in alphabetical order" so people whose names start with A will have a bad time that day lol.. and he has a new thing for that day every week.. it makes things fun
Hey everypony.
also makes for fun replays
especially since he commentates on them
hey LTF:D
how's it going?
good, and you?
pretty decent
Did Luna ever beat that game last night?
oh.. dunno i wasn't there
Oh.
She seemed to be having trouble.
which game?
Serious Sam 2
lol never heard of it
Nether had I.Lol
Do you know the movies for tonight?
nope
Hey,I'm going to sign out,but I'll be right back.OK?
alright
...and I'm back.
I wanted to turn on Pandora.
pandora is a music thingy right?
I think someone said the movies tonight were Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland. Not sure which "Babes in Toyland" though.
Ah, she's gone.
I think someone said the movies tonight were Batman Begins and Babes in Toyland. Not sure which "Babes in Toyland" though.
...now I'm back.
lol pandora is music thing right?
Right
alright couldn't remember very well
I just looked up Babes in Toyland. It's rated 4.9 out of 10.
Which version?
'34, '61, '86, or '97?
'86
Ah, the one with Keanu Reeves.
They made a movie like that in '34?
I guess so.
The '34 version apparently had Laurel and Hardy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(1934_film)
Damn I want that one then.
The actual original version, according to Wikipedia, is this one:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(operetta)
From 1903.
If you guys won the lottery, which movies would y'all pick?
Grave of the Fireflies and Fantastic Adventures of Unico
Stranger Than Fiction and Pod People.
this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQDe3DFv-Dw
probably anyway.. i can't think of anything else i would rather
What is this?
arashi no yoru ni
Sorry, I don't know anything about japanease movies
i don't think many people here would know what that is so i just posted a video of it lol.. i think people should recognize it before the name
Is this an A-movie or a B-movie?
imo it's quite A quality
it's also anime
I would watch it.
Grave of the Fireflies I know is an A movie.
well the thing is this movie doesn't have an official dub.. it's fandubbed BUT it's better than many official dubs imo
that's why the name is still japanese despite it being in english
Who here remembers playing F-Zero X on Nintendo 64?
never played it myself
Never owned a Nintendo 64.
I played it yesterday for the first time in like ten years.
I went from a SNES, to a PS2, to having a Gamecube.
I forgot how motion sick it can make you.
And I didn't get the SNES until the n64 had been out for a bout a year.
SNES was the bomb. Super Mario World was one of the best Mario games.
Link to the Past.
Final Fantasy VI.
/me brohoofs EspyLacopa.
Awesome picks
Kefka is still one of my favorite villains.
Retro Nintendo was the best Nintendo.
Ye Olde Megaman games.
I've got the Megaman collection on Gamecube.
Though I do rather like Megaman Legends.
/me was disappointed when Legends 3 was canceled
I never played that one.
*any of those*
Old Playstation 1 games.
I never owned any Playstations.
hahahaha, The Bronie Collective has snagged another webcomic artist.

i find this pic awesome and pretty creepy
08,1o-o
06,15I would agree with that.
.... . .-.. .-.. --- / -.- .. -- .. -.- ---
08,1depends on how you look at it
the art style is cool but the pic in it self i find disturping
08,1I see it as very artistically creative, and the style is reminiscent of that of a stained-glass window
yep
but that grin pinky has >_>
would give me nightmare from now on
08,1heh... ^^; I guess that part /is/ a little creepy
06,15I don't think Kimiko speaks Morse code, EspyLacopa :P
...lurkalurka...
oh well need to pack so i can visit some friends this weekend =D
06,15I'm on the ponynet!
08,1o-o?
Bill Clinton is a brony?
08,11He is?
http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/22/the-throwback-my-little-pony/
06,15Or just lucky....

sooooo much hair gel
06,15It would be cool if Clinton was a brony though...
reminds me of something i heard about "hair cement" or something
08,1awww
more like "the throw forward" cause.. ONWARD!
08,1lol
06,15He says the most powerful enemy of the ponies is the cynical grown-up Chester........
like a banana in mario kart
06,15I will now write angry letters about this
06,15(actually I won't)
actually in mario kart you usually through a banana forward and slip on it yourself
Well, based on Season 2, shouldn't the answer now be D: Discord?
rawr
chester mcbadbat?
gasp. Rainbow Dash vs Starscream?
indeed
08,1guess
08,1what
08,1I'm going to do?
06,15The quiz was done a couple of months ago, EspyLacopa
Fluttershy`: photosynthesis?
08,1I'm going to post something completely unrelated to MLP..! D:
I'm not sure who to root for. . .Dash or Starscream. . .
08,1but it's funny nonetheless
08,1XD
lol
08,1sorry, and the brown-haired one's expression in the last panel... o_o

06,15:O
http://i.derpy.me/o5Ookl.jpg
Doing a bit of stress testing on the new caching system
08,1Trolluna XD
So feel free to clicky that
And let me know if it breaks
So, how I spent my day?
I added caching to all database calls in the image short url handler and added support for conditional get
08,1o-o
08,1I have no idea what you just said
08,1but it sounds cool!
08,1^^;
All-in-all, when a new uncached image is being requested, it'll take a while to load
/me doesn't understand techie talk at all, unlike FlutterBro13 (her little brother irl)
But after that the image is returned more faster with less processing server side
:P
08,1bah
08,1RobotPinkie did you understand? >>
(You open the image twice, it loads faster on the second time)
08,1Eh.
08,1Kinda.
08,1Get it.
08,1But not really. XD
:P
08,1Trololololo.

Alright thanks.
Pretty short school day today.
Only 2 lessons.

Also, what'd I miss? :o
08,1I woke up about an hour ago again =_=
06,15Was Daz here for like... 10 seconds just now?
08,1Now it's 7:20 AM
You know what?
Nice conclusion for Dash vs Starscream fight.
16:21:50 <@DerpyBot> The next episode airs in 0d:23h:38m:09s
EspyLacopa: Oh, is that out now?
Poor Dash though, Starscream is going to be stuck annoying her. . .FOREVER!
08,1yay, true

YOU CAN NEVER DEFEAT STAR-*GULP*
Lawl
08,1woo-hoo!
06,15Eh, I dunno Fluttershy`, it's just personal stuff...
08,1Ah... I know how that goes D:
/me hugs RobotPinkie
/me hugs Fluttershy` back "Thank you"
08,1.____. I had a really bad night last night 'cause of stupid things involving me and my friend...
08,1=_=; -sighs-
06,15Sorry to hear that, Fluttershy` :(
06,15People should just like... learn to relax and have some ponies, or something...
Morning everypony
06,15Morning, AllisZero
08,1Ugh. It was more annoying than anything... and it doesn't matter that she likes MLP too. It was like... 'hey look I've been your best friend for three years... but not really. I don't need you any more.'
06,15Wow, that sucks
/me hangs her head. "Surpisingly, I'm more relieved than anything. Hurt, but relieved."
Hey everypony.
/me hugs Fluttershy`
/me hugs back
I'm catching the conversation a bit late but that sucks, Fluttershy`
Morning RP!
08,1=_= like I said... glad all the crap is over with...
Dragonshard?
06,15Yeah, sometimes that's the best thing, I think...
/me nods.
08,1Anyhoo...
08,1I need to eat some breakie e-e
08,1I will be back soon
06,15See you in a bit, Fluttershy` <3
finally connect to chat at school...
school ends :l
Which is why I love homeschool.
indeed homeschool is awesome
Or using your computer at school is also :D
gnomeschool is even better
I stayed up last night
Thinking of a cool design for my entry in the pony shirt contest
Polarfire, ony this early?
:OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<3
heh.
I'm at school :3

It was alright Polarfire.
How about you, feeling better today? :<
oh.
ohai wb
Hey.
Did you get my last message?
I got it was alright.
Hmm, that's strange.
I didn't see Val go crazy over this EQD post.
Which I'dve thought he would have.
06,15What post? :O
hmm
06,15Oh, yeah, I already went nuts over that
XD
It didn't work on my computer. . .crashed my BGTutu install =[
06,15I don't use any other mods, so
1 moar day ;D
i just saw a couple of the sickest things i've seen all month within like a minute of each other or so
thanks bronies i knew i could count on you
but 1 didn't come from here
the other however.. i'm looking at you mantis
Hey, It says Show time, but no vid starting here

hello Turgle
Hello MakerDusk !
yes i'm from italy
42 different bronies have connected from italy
https://gist.github.com/b918a480bb3f2a3d7137
^^^ list of different countries that connect to ponychat.net
Yay Finland!
cripes
ponies is p big in the US
lol
no kidding XD
though I'm canadian myself
I guess ponies is actually on TV in the US though
that helps
so true
though anyone with internet has no excuse
^
Tbh I was not expecting to see Finland so high top there-
right beneath Germany, at that
it's ok, one day everyone will be in the cult of pony
and love and tolerance will rule the day
also molestia
molestia went to sleep already
What are we talking about?
aussies and their weird timezone and all
LunaTheForgotten: https://gist.github.com/b918a480bb3f2a3d7137

The US is way up there.
it is
though I /know/ there is another brony somewhere in my city
I saw the join when episode 1 was about to air
it was just scrolling so fast that I lost it
/me cries
:c
i have to find an italian xD
you know they exist, at least
at least
also, I'm bored
so does anypony want a vhost?
CERN: http://i.imgur.com/cDvnU.jpg
I saw a pretty interesting comparison the other day
There was a supernova, few thousand light years away, back in 1987
The neutrinos showed up 3 hours before the light of the explosion did
sounds about right
if I do recall my astrophysics course correctly
But this guy's point was that if the scale had been the same, we'd seen the neutrinos in 1984 and the light only in 1987
no, because the speed approaches the absolute limit
err...
yay ponies!!!
>_>
<_<
no physicist here
Eh, neither am I, but I thought it was an interesting point
But isn't that the whole point of this discovery? That the lightspeed may not be the absolute top limit?
relativity*
Yep
This will spark a debate
In that case the comparison with the neutrinos coming from supernova years earlier is correct then.
But proof will only come with a lot more testing imho
light speed is the limit
there are ways around it
take hyperspace for one
But that's just it. What if light speed is not the limit
(actual hyperspace not scifi)
it is
but you have to take warping in accelerated space into account
damn it!
I did it again!
yay ponies
hello Luna ^_^
07,1hello Dusky
Morning Luna
Well, almost evening there for you :p
07,1yea...
>_> you guys are evil for making me break character
07,1I was wondering should I play some more Sam 2?
do you want a vhost Luna?
Seriously tho. Like one of the article said it's either that light speed is not the limit, or the measuremets were wrong, or the neutrinos used some shortcut.
07,1vhost?
At the moment no one knows.
that's what I was saying WhatPayne
Yeah, but it'll spark a lot of debate
they used a short cut
But what if they did not.
Luna: like what giggles has
so if you do a whois on him all it says is "giggle@the.ghosties"
07,1sure :)
what would you like?
I can set anything after the '@' to replace your hostmask
And until proven othervise, I still trust that light speed is absolute limit too. But still this iis very curious.
rawr
07,1hmmm let me think of that :)
sure, I'm generally around
us Admins are always watching...
O_O
/me hides the plans to take over the world
WhatPayne: it's just a matter of what frame you hold constant
So, you were saying?
What do you mean by frame?
07,1now that sounds scary :)
c remains constant in most frames, so we choose to hold it constant in all
oh
what do you think happens to the speed of light when it crosses a time dilation field?
07,1A Sonic rainbow will occur
BOOM
or even into a medium with a different refractive index?
07,1sonic rainboom!
Please hold... computing...
Fatal Error at line 1: http://i.derpy.me/kIJFD.jpg
No no. I believe in scientific method. Until proven othervise Light is still the constant.
it's not though
it depends of permitivity and permiability
but it always depends on only those two factors
if n<0 then you can send messages through time XD
if n>0 there is lag and refraction accordingly
The speed of light in vacuum is physical constant
when permitivity = permiability = 0?
yes
Sorry, but my physics knowlege is quite lacking in this area tbh.
07,1streams up
the theory of relativity (not the special theory) explains the spatial distortions that also affect it
don't feel bad WhatPayne, there are 7 of us left in my year level
Of course. Gravity, and materia effect the speed of light.
and I'm taking a year off XD
...and I;\'m back
Haha xkcd
*I'm*
/me waves @ LunaTheForgotten
I've said that already...
/me comes back with food
/me waves back
I spent 3 hours debugging code
No problemo. It's nice to know someone is interested enough to actually study these matters
hmm... maybe I did go a bit too technical
By brain can't handle math/physics today...
Luna,Did you ever beat the game?
it comes naturally to me
07,1yea i did
07,1long time ago
07,1will continue in a bit :)
'later Luna
07,1are you leaving Dusk?
...
I thought you were
07,1no no
07,1i'm streaming :)
XD
ah
What does have to do to get a vhost? Ask nicely? :3
07,1pre-pre-pre-pre show
MakerDusk, where are you from?
Diftraku: what would you like?
I'm happy I will finally be here tonight.
To watch the entire movie.
WhatPayne: I'm in Canada
MakerDusk: Haven't really thought about it, just wondering how difficult it is to setup
Diftraku: you tell me what you want, I give it to you
Oh well that explains how you used those terms such effectively.
Well, it sure is easier that reverse DNS xD
XD
WhatPayne: I've got 1.5 years until I get my first 2 BSc degrees
and if you're wondering, I'm 21
o_O
and this is ruining my persona as 'the approachable server admin'
XD
my second major is Mathematical Science
Well, so far you're the only server admin I've talked to on irc :3
not true
Unless it's computers huh
I'm the only one who has identified themself as an admin ;)
True xD
Us computer science majors are the shit of the science field
WhatPayne: don't worry, I tutor for a few extra bucks
you're a lot better informed that the messes I usually get
*than
good god!
I'd be glad to listen, but unfortunately really broke.
what happened to our education systems!!!
Really? And here I thought I was awful at this area?
meh. what I meant was, I don't have trouble explaining
and it doesn't bother me
MakerDusk: Is New.Lunar.Republic fine with you for my vhost?
yup
:3
are you a registered nick?
ee-yup
in that case...
I got irssi idling 247
there you go
go ahead and /whois yourself
I can thank Hawkin and Neil deGrasse Tyson and Lawrence Krauss and others for keeping my interest up.
Thanks <3
And Wikipedia...
did you know that Hawking hasn't come up with anything since his original thesis?
Well I heard he made a book recently.
nothing new
yet the physicist who invented true holograms is unknown
Well I'll be...
I suppose those will be made public in a year or two...
It'll probably take anywhere from 10 to 15 years for affordable consumer versions?
Holograms?
at the moment they are only monochromatic
but they look like sculpters
right up untill you put your hand through them
visible from all angles
opaque
Any idea if it needs two opposite surfaces to work or just one?
just one
so table with a random object growing out of it
that looks real
until you try to touch it
You can just chuck a 3d model at it and it'll display it?
it's done using the Quantum Electro Dynamics
to an extent
physicist suck at rendering images
*physicists
Confound these ponies, first idea about that hologram was to project ponies...
and only still images at the moment due to the extensive quantum mechanical calculations involved in displaying it
I'd like to see that discord model
Discord Shuffling...
Now THAT is something I'd buy
Diftraku: you'd need to find a physicist who could do those calculations...
Yeah, I can tell they aren't small ones
/me hasn't seen the math
they kept that secret, the bastards!
:P
(from the rendering math, you can derive all their work)
that would be an epic statue
MakerDusk, exactly what do you mean here?
MFW I thought that model had been 3D printed.
:D
well, the display is is QED in nature
knowing what is is displaying and having the equations for that would let you reverse engineer the structure of the table
Yes that is awesome 3D model shat sould be 3D printed.
*that
It's quite epic that shortly after Microsoft released the Kinect development tools to public, they made it into a 3D model scanner
same has been done with cameras for ages though
Fffffffffffff
hello Revolver
This is gonna be such a pain in my ass to do
Whoever made these folders and shares is an idiot
And has no idea how a domain structure is supposed to work

yep..... but im going to go really soon =O some pony is picking me up so i can visit some frieds =O
/whois yourself, Luna
07,1cheers MakerDusk :)
07,1now back to serious business
Luna both HD and Classic is done dl XD
lol
MakerDusk: Any idea if the netsplits that happened this morning on ponyirc and geekshed had anything to do with each other?
Since Steam was wonky all night
YAY i love net splits >_<
07,1great, we'll play SOON!
hmm?
#EQD lost DerpyBot for a long time...
I'm not on geekshed so I couldn't say
They weren't even much apart from eachother
and my computer crashed, depriving me of precious oper logs on our netsplit
I know we were going to restart one of the servers to add flash client support though
I noticed the server message :p
ok im off!
=D
though such would have only affected die hard pony fans
the ones who connect through rarity.ponychan.net and such instead of irc.ponychan.net
Oh, I still use irc.ponyirc.com xD
XD
I want Derpybot in here
Lol
18:54:28 <@DerpyBot> The next episode airs in 0d:21h:05m:30s
if you use irc.ponychat.net, you connect negligably faster :P
Well, I don't DC often :3
XD
ssh + screen + irssi <3
If you use irc.ponychat.net you're more likely to connect slower.
really?!!
o_O
I'd have thought so?
that address is a pointer
Instead of connecting directly to a server, you're connecting to the round robin first.
Which points you to one of the servers.
So that surely takes longer than just a direct connection?
that dumps you over to irc.ponychat.net
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nOsm9luUKM&feature=related
A quick dig returns 4 A records for irc.ponychat.net
I really need to get a new modem.
Hey.
I don't believe we've officially met
/me is Dusky
Ah, nice to meet you then.
I suppose my main job is keeping everyone happy
MakerDusk: ponyirc returns just an alias for ponychat.net
07,1I like Dusky
07,1it sounds cute
So your main job is making people happy eh?
It's even the same IP
Make me happy.. Bring Derpybot to BronyState
XD
Hmm, maybe later MakerDusk, got a couple of things to do.
I was hoping I'd get few ports opened but it's been couple days after my e-mail now... don't really mind it, getting used to irssi
No /sajoin :O
Ah, thats a shame. :P
nope

Aww.

also, no tossing our cells into the oper channel

2,15ISo does this work?
Yup

I had to copy and paste it from mIRC
Oh.

07,1I'll get you a link Aloex

Hey
how do I kick my ghost?
All my sadness
when's the episode again?
I don't like being informed every time someone joins or leaves.
It's a standard IRC message. I actually prefer to know when people leave. :)
heh
i like the log in of the chat
Oh thank god
Though at levels like this, I would /prefer/ an option to turn it off
at what time is the episode again?
saves time of having to type in the /msg nick serv
theatre/backup/ still uses mibbit
Bleh, I like a litlle mystery in my life.
FriendshipCannon same
i have made my snacks ready for tonights movies
This one time I had the displeasure of earing a jalapeno pepper muffin
ah how do we direct mesages
?
No warning from anybody that that's what it was.
double click the name
2 pizzas after i have ate this one, milkshake, Pepsi max, toffee and Crisps
/me is AFK
at what time is the episode on?
USA = 9am
Fresh bag of Cheetos here, along with some Chips Ahoy! and other g00d eats
UK = 2PM
^
yay
:)
ok
that's 3pm germany
yep
so i can get some sleep if i feel like it
plus the episode will be on youtube about 1 hour after airing
The new chat is odd.

Wont let me change it still
2,14 that's because you have to wait for it to time out
2,14 kicking it doesn't do anything
Have you ident'd yet?
What Natleyn said
excellent
/me needs to construct additional pylons
thanks
2,14 you're welcome
I'm on the mibbit chat, i don't like the new one
What doo yoou mean?
Please bring the Mibbit Back
why don't you all just download an irc client?
/me is on a client, so gf
I like the whole setup, but I don't like how it says when someone's offline, I don't like the black and white everything
Same i'm on the mibbit one too
13
turgle: mIRC is at the point where it won't even say continue anymore, just exit.
then use xchat
i don't like the message telling me who joins and quits
ja, grab mIRC, XChat, or Nettalk. I've had good experience with all of them.
Irssi <3
Lets see...
mibbit lags way to much when busy we had 5 min or more lagg on mibbbit last week
o
oo
xchat is just another trial for windows >_>
I wont recomend the client I use
13 Hmm...
Dumori what is it
it's a nasty hack
/me approves of ChatZilla.
dumori don't you use some hacked together custom client lol
Agsin
Shoot
/me hugs DSNesmith
/me hugs natleyn
so dumori how big did that file end up last week
1.3k bronies
that was crazy
I still wish we'd done a tootstorm
2,14 no

That picture is amazing.

It will automatically invert the text color Natleyn

fandom goes insane
06,15Season 2 needs moar Luna
the whole episode luna tries to speak but keeps getting interrupted
luna's episode: Luna:hi - cutes to credits
MY DAAWWW CAPACITY IS OVERFLOWING!!
More Luna, Less Celestia.
and then I get a heart attack
That reminds me on that fake pony-chan chat-cutout-picture of a brony ranting about Luna saying 'Hello'
episode where luna gets turned invisible
I know why there's that gap...
and no one notices
06,15Less Trollestia, more Luna, yep.
an entire episode of them trying to find luna, turns out she was behind them the whole time
Better yet...
They'll probably sneak in a 10 second clip of S2 luna
Luna trying to live the life of a normal pony
More Luna, Less Celestiaâ„¢
Luna vs. Threesome ^^
There we go.

05all your faces when me and val really do love eachother.
Let's see what this new chat is all about
Scootalove FTW
mon visage quand
Best Bowie song is Starman
I give up
AllisZero
PM me
have we ever watched labyrinth in here
Only Scootalove <3
we totally should
so what's different about this chat?
I don't think so.
no colors :(
heh
Full Metal Jacket GO
2,14 interior_gummy: oo
06,15No colors?
interior you can connect through mibbit
05what do you mean?
there are a lot of movies that should be watched
and get the good chat back :P
like fight club
06,15You can't see our colors, interior_gummy?
White is a color :P
DSNesmith no we haven't watched it.
Me no like it
ooooooohhhhhh
if I win b-movie
we are watching baby geniuses next week
2
AllisZero: I know, right? D:
I prefer the other chat! Give it back
you evil person!
We totally should
RobotPinkie, he can see your colours. The new IRC is just less colourful than mibbit.
don't let him win mods!
If I'm picked for the movie, I'm picking best movies ever.
05he already did
i feel like watching the incredibles for a movie
06,15Makes sense.
i'd pick Manos: The hands of Fate
but the mst3k version
manos isn't even funny
if i win A movie, i will definatly choose Saving Private Ryan
it's just appalling
Shaun of the Dead
Full Metal Jacket
Lawrence of Arabia
Beastmaster
It's awfully hard to see people individually now, wow
05I'd pick the day the earth stood still
we can't watch MST3k
I think I'll post this every hour or so. This channel is for BronyState regulars ONLY: #BronyStateRegulars <-- This only applies if you come here like every day. Not once or twice a week.
As stated on bash.org, 'IRC is multiplayer notepad'
06,15Just checking it out now.
that's the point of chat
I still need to see saving private ryan.
Shaving Ryan's privates
lol
lol @ newfilly posting oldfilly channel
b movie, i hope for batman & robin
I'm usually in here, so...
:l
06,15It looks pretty sexy with all that white and then suddenly mod colors.
OFF TO ORDER CHINESE WOOOO
oh no this thing
night of the Pony <3
mod colours = sexier
my choice would be either the thing or hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for a movie
excuse me while I go take some tylenol for this video
i'd actually pick Kungfu Hustle as B movie
the Thing!
05RobotPinkie <3
TheMaster: YES
:D
that is a FANTASTIC movie
People!
man the japanese make some crazy videos.
We need a Jackie Chan movie!

i suggest alien vs ninja
The Ring 2 (the japanese version)
oh, fun XP
Don't worry RBD, there's ponies

06,15lawl
Never Say Never
And was reminded that "Legend of Dragoon" is the only game that's had a scene that's made me cry. ;_;
^
why not just pick a real scary movie like the shining?
Combustiblelemons: It's called My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Season 2
legend of dragoon
Combustiblelemons: That's about everyother YouTube comment.

06,15Pokeymans Emeralds, EspyLacopa
Random thoughts gave birth to Doctor Twisano
/me is led to believe this is Sonic.
RobotPinkie: i used to have emerald GBA ROM
yay, I'm back. with chinese fingercuffs on to restrict my typing speed.
but the music is bearable
Ah.
Again?
at least
/me is watching Mad Max on T.V.
but its on my friends laptop
my all time favourite PMV ^_^
I'm actually liking Matt Smith this whole season
Correction: This music is beautiful
Only Sonic games I've played are a few of the ones that were on the Game Gear.
my favorite is I'll make a Man out of You
naw
The Sonic Adventure games were sort of a mixed bag
guess whose set to appear next episode?
06,15Any way to play Emerald is good.
i can show you beautiful music
haven't seen that one actually
hint, look at my name
this isn't it
Could never get through the maze that is the final zone.
you haven't!?
Anyone excited for Sonic Generations?!
Hey, Sonic Adventure 2. :)
it's got Rarity!
yep
but it's on all the time!
In Doctor Who Classic, I just finished the first Pertwee season
My favorite is Moon over the castle. But I'm thinking opera isn't a favorite...
>doesn't like rarity much
hi GoldenTahu
-.-
/me is having a wonderful time without alcohol
*trollface*
just go before somepony gets hurt
Hey
/me brohoofs Veewave
Pertwee is currently one of my favorite doctors
When a game makes you play stupid bullshit to get to the good parts, this is called "Sonic Adventure 2 Syndrome"
Veewave: Oh you!
glad you join us :)
fashion pony is best pony
hey, everyones got ponies they like and hate
I want to get my hand on a box set of the Tom Baker run. Buy myself some jelly babies
07,1Alright taking REQUESTS in 33 mins from now on in #Vinyl_Scratch
oh me...
saddest corruption in S2E1?
When's the show start?
/me WONDERS WHAT HAPENED TO THE PRINCE?
and everyone hates twist *eyeroll*
dunno
this is a 9 people small chat, if you want to get into the 100 people chat, click on the "bronystate" next to the "pinkie_pie" chat channel down at the bottom
good question
Wait, there's a new channel for us?
oopps sorry for the caps
Robert Delgado is Best Master
should be in about 10 minutes
Twist is pretty cute
but i certainly know pinkie got the creepiest
Until she opens her mouth
no that's a fake secret clubhouse :P
nopony likes a lisp
Ahhh.
what, her lithp ithn't cute?
personally i think Rainbow
No lisps are fine
ok when it starts I may just be on and off, and i don't know how long I can stay
I think Lisp is a beautiful programming language.
when is the show starting?
Twist = meh.
Reignbao dash
It's her voice itself that makes me want to punch babies
I love twist
1 hour
if only because of all the hate she gets
since she had to choose between her friends and old home
lawl, the show is starting in 1 hour
I may not be the biggest Sonic fan but this song brings back so many memories
pinkie had decapitated discord
Flutterb****
and the whole...laughing balloons
I dunno
I don't really bother much with background ponies
sheesh, HIM from ppg couldn't have done that better
creepiest not saddest
except DJ P0n-3.
06,15RALTS, FUCK YEAH!
Fanon ftw.
i talk about saddest
06,15I LOVE RALTS
ah, bg ponies are half the fun :P
show is starting in 1 hour
ruts rat?
I really don't like Sonic Adventure 2, but it gives me a warm, fuzzy nostalgic feeling all the same
just asked in the big chat
indeed.
ok
Pinkie's corruption freaked me out
Sonic the Hedgehog mod, replacing Sonic with Rainbow Dash?
Applejacks
you rant one ron ton soop?
it was her begging him to stop that got me
I'll be back in this small chat then
well so did AJ's
in the first sonic yes.
kk
EPIC
I am ron my ray
beep beep
it was the balloons for me
weee
derivery
that canon music video
Is twist really a bg pony?
Dash is too awesome to be in any other sonic game.
friggin' creepy
equestria girls!
inb4 Brony mention
so how about some REAL MUSI- oh forget it
inb4
Is bronystate streaming the new episode tomorrow?
Damnit.
Tails' place is taken by Pinkie Pie and her zany flying contraptions?
yay!
ITT: Pinkie sings better than the actual singer of this song
Equestria Girls!
06,15I love this.
inb4induring
[ger]Brony1 saddest or creepiest?
inafterinb4induring
That mention.
well twist is more of a one time character I guess
E-questria-girls
Anything > Katy Perry.
Applejacks: Saddest
its nice to see Hasbro/Hub's executives arn't totally dead to the world.
maybe she'll appear again in S2 though
There needs to be a speed metal version of Equestria Girls
its so awesome they did a brony shoutout in this song
Battery acid cocktail > Katy Perry
she already did didn't she?
I think they're still wondering how to tap us as a market
but once they do... all my monies
Oh, that's easy
I'm trying to do a mashup of this song and Megadeth's Looking Down the Cross
along with snips and snails
Espy- make it happen :L
make better toys
Sell things on shiny discs
?
^ and that
So... what's the show today?
you know that your career is FUCKED when you egt outsung by a pink, hyperactive, mentally unstable pony
ya, they're streaming again
Bring out a white Celestia
when will they sell plushies?
I think it's the Hub realizing that 20-30 year old guys have more disposable income than 5 year old girls.
plushies of DERPY
DJ Pon-3
Heh.
Turgle, they already have plush...oh
Shrek 2.
I love Pinkeh Pah
oh wow
this video
<3
I have this song on my PC somewhere. :p
Aw Shrek..
My favorite one time pony is Nurse Redheart. Because Nurse.
love this song
I'm leaving
I love both versions of this song
Is she a "Helloooooo Nurse" type?
I have to think of Schimanski every time i hear this song.
By DARK_HEART!!
We need a sad song right about now.
My favorite is Octavia.
OOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Nurse redheart has a good design I think
i need a heroooo
I just love nurses
Hey is bronystate streaming the new episode tomorrow?

what's the order of movies tonight?
2,14 ponies, batman begins, then babes
Was funny when portal 2 first came out, now it's just a pain :S
05sounds like a good night
I sure hope they don't write John D Lancie out of the show, I'm sure he's expensive but he's too good to just waste as a one off villian
yey
who remembers Short Circuit 2 with the original version of this song? I loved that Scene
When life gives you lemons you make combustiblelemons
Okay does anyone know anything about this babes movie
we'll start at 7pm EST?
imdb knew nothing
Short Circuit 2 > Short Circuit
...
SDo... what's the stream today?
Short Circuit 1/2 for A movie
Short Round > Shor Circuit
Sonic rainboom made me dislike rarity.
Such an Enthusiastic Channel here~ xD
Short Circit 1/2.. you mean the robot turnsninto a girl?
short circuit is A movie
Wait, what are this week's pony episodes?
yeah it does that apparently.
Or Starcream turns into a girl?

Look before you sleep and something else.
He got eaten.
Animal House for B movie as well. so many good choices

/me hugs DSNesmith
Was one of my first ones, too.
stupid bobby kotick...ruining my starcraft
2,14 I was rather happy when they posted it on dorkly
/me hugs Flaria back
d'aww, bunnies
First saw this on the stream this week
First thing with ponies I saw was the moonbase alpha ponies... god I have bad taste
DSNesmith: Congrats, you're the first to follow me through a nick change
Bunny stampede is most adorable stampede
I'm torn between 10 Million Fluttershys and Peach for my faveorite.
became a brony just last weekend
into overWHY
welcome to the herd
This is my favorite pony video
maximum ponydrive
Both are requiests, BTW.
For me, uh
Mines the LOTR trailer
07,1not in this channel pls
been a brony since episode 3-4
My bunnies are in your base, killing your ponies. KEKEKEKEKEKKE!
Or the pack in my case.
07,1requests is Vinyl_Scratch
And also managed to show my brother the beauty of ponies yesterday
Saw this video of my little pony with censor bleeps and I thought the art style was really cute
with self-made cupcakes
it was the constant threads on /co/ that made me curious
some guys at work are now bronies thanks to me :D
Still can't wait for the first SC2 expansion. :P
nice combustiblelemons
A mate of mine dragged me into it TheMaster.
EPIC
So am I the only one a bit annoyed that SuperBrony64 not only started requesting early, but requested 6 videos
as for first contact with bronydom, memebase.
last week I made my first conversion
talking to friend over facebook
2,14 nope :P
Okay, sure that's not forbidden per se, but... meh :/
Ah, Portal 2.
system why you lag'en no bad.
Meh.
lol portal =D
<3
Isn't Heart of the Swarm already out?
randomly link him to episode one
Oh yes!
06,15<3 JoCo
dat facebook
Not yet , no.
But it does sound like an asshat move
dat facebook bloop
does this ever get old :D
This song! :D
Facebook noise lol
day later he goes 'DAMN YOU. PINKIE PIE IS MY FAVORITE.'
My friend thinks bronies is a cult, and is worried about my safety.
lmao XD
>implying its not a cult
Sounds like your friend needs a hug.
vacuumal: Apple is a cult, but is THAT such a bad thing?
we dont' ask you to sacrifice anyone to Celestia for at least two months after initiation
Portal 2 rox!
/me was a fan of Jonathan Coulton before Portal came out :p
*sharpes his sickle* Hmmm?
06,15We may or may not be a dangerous cult.
^
Wait we AREN'T a cult?
07,1Bronydom is a religion
love and tolerance, and half your paycheck every week
oh heh, bitcomment, that explanes it.
an awesom cult
Whoops
facebook noise
we sure seem to twitter/obsessively follow anyone even SLIGHTLY related to the series
were more of a fandom than a cult.
Equestria is made of LOVE AND PEACE!
Applejack is made of Dark Matter. So there.
/me rushes to hide the sacrificial daggers
Remember, in times of doubt: WWRDD.
dat facebooking
05is it normal for your upper gums to bleed?
I already sacrificed a few people
I keep checking my tabs
What would rainbow dash do.
It is
At random
.... no, wrek
X'D
our rituals involve coming to Bronystate and eating cupcakes when we can
Wrek, not usually..?
Wrek: Did you just brush your teeth vigorously? :P
if you stab them it is.
05nope
05not around the teeth
06,15If you don't brush your teeth ever, then yes.
05center
Wrek: nope.jpg
05above the tongue
Then no.
That's weird.
and watching 1 pmv daily
I repeat... RD VS Screasmer-- EPIC.
did you eat barbed wire?
its only a matter of time before people start getting tattoo cutie marks
and posting them online
I brush my teeth with barbed wire

We had a guy who hunted deer on our property, with the agreement that we'd get some of the meat when he killed a deer.
I meet some mates from highschool today. Turns out one of them is homophobic and not afraid to admit it. I just feel a little depressed at the moment. What happened with love and acceptance?
damn this room is really quiet
Damn you ThePretender! I'll get you for this travesty!
lol
07,1So many requests so little time...

Bo Burnham has a better irony song
BLASPHEMY Rarity would not suck it, she would gently kiss it. much more ladylike
Confusing was the first one.

The guy could normally get 2 or 3 deer each winter.
Apple Bloom is most adorable MC

2,14 good choice :P
Pluto is the second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System (after Eris) and the tenth-most-massive body observed directly orbiting the Sun. Originally classified as the ninth planet from the Sun, Pluto was recategorized as a dwarf planet and plutoid due to the discovery that it is one of several large bodies within the newly charted Kuiper belt.
Hey, everyone.

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is composed primarily of rock and ice and is relatively small: approximately a fifth the mass of the Earth's Moon and a third its volume.

ladies and gentlemen, our hero
07,1indeed
07,1:)
05i like trains.
mud fight!
07,1Also sad news..
It has an eccentric and highly inclined orbit that takes it from 30 to 49 AU (4.4â€“7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to periodically come closer to the Sun than Neptune.
All this violence is making me want to smash a bro
YAY FOR MOVIE NIGHTS

gj ggg
Hi.
techdude300: SSL Ports: 6600, 6697, 6698
gg
if this is his worst, then no he can't
This is the only page i have open and i'm not seeing it in the site
I missed it, what happened to the two kids in the beginning?
06,15His father is Pluto the dog, SuperBrony64.. I'm sure of it.
Does that make him weak to plutonium?
challenge...accepted.
lawl
RobotPinkie: I'll just assume the reason is magic.
well, i think this is a pretty bad movie
the beginning is great
thanks
but when he actually becomes batman
06,15Magic is friendship, don't forget.
it just goes downhill like fuck
And he ain't even mad
DAT soundtrack <3
GOOGOOGJOOB
Bad as in micheal jackson bad
techdude300: no probs
Hey anyone here from Finland I don't know yet?

WHY U RUIN IT?!?!?!

DAMMIT ValtheJean!
04BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRB
ok so I've tried to switch to low quality and to reload the whole page.

But I'm the walrus :C
yep

Batman Begins
lol Fluttercry i was thinking the samething XD
agreed
being funny
04BATCEPTION
Strange man RUUUUUNNNN
what RobotPinkie said
I never saw this movie! Where's the part with Morgan Freeman?!
so was i
Ok, ba- wait... Weren't the 2 epsidoes supposed to play first?
this calls for the inception button!
It's almost boring now even through he's so good.
DONT DO IT BATMAN
laugh softly to self.
04I actually don't care much for Batman Begins either
07,1first time for me watching this too
I ahven't seen this one :3
THAT FLOWER IS POISON
Tovler: they go in between movies
07,1it sounds a bit like inception...
Tovler: Aww man, you missed out
thanks, Ghosties
Batman Begins > The Dark Knight
07,1but that might be me
/me has watched that movie before. Twice.
ggg... if you think iÃ¤m funny, you serioualy have to get out more
Inception was great
this movie also greatly suffers from the "too long" syndrom
05can you do that? watch a movie? TWICE!?
xD
Dark Knight was pretty good, though Heath Ledger isn't the best Joker :P
Inception music uses a similar background melody Luna
Inception DID spawn a few too many memes though.
great 15 whole minutes were missed.
06,15Yeah, I'm with Dashite on that, I enjoy this a lot more than the sequel.
I prefer Memento myself
Wrek: no, you can't:P
Wrek: Impossibru!
Grundle: DONT YOU DARE
I was so excited when I heard Scarecrow was in this movie, he's my favorite Batman villain aside from Bane.
inception is so amazingly overrated
Wrek, pfft. I can watch a movie 6 times! In a row!
inb4 asskicking
even though its not a bad movie
whos the bald guy
is that ken tanaka?
The Holy Grail!
RobotPinkie o/
is that the asian guy from inception?
06,15I seek the elements of harmony!
dashite I dare you to do that with the original MLP movie.
So wait, did his parents die already?
I seek the holy grail
so, only because i disagree with you, im trolling?
06,15\o Dashite
his parents are DEAAAD
What is your favourite colour?
I seek another cuppa tea.
TEIM FOR PLUTO TRIVIA
Discord > elements of harmony
well, if that makes you sleep better tonight, believe it
Dunno.
they so dead...
i dont hate these movies
i dont hate any movies
suddenly asskicking
RAWRity, :/ That would be kinda boring...
Pretty sure it is. Nolan likes to do that
and i dont dislike inception
Nolan has this nasty tendency to reuse actors...
inb4 argument about how this movie was good yet The Hulk sucked.
he's speaking Japanese
06,15Want to take bets for S2E2, Combustiblelemons? :P
Power kick.
I hate some movies
i just dont think its so amazing
it's getting real in here
Like, uh
the hulk did suck
From its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto was classified as a planet. In the late 1970s, following the discovery of minor planet 2060 Chiron in the outer Solar System and the recognition of Pluto's relatively low mass, its status as a major planet began to be questioned
Panic room
Hello
hmmm... what are the options robotpinkie?
"hate" is a strong word
Get pwned by Qui Gon
/me is pretty sure he knows what the ep2's plot is, but he will keep his lips shut.
And Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
pwn'd...
RobotPinkie: I put $5 down on Elements of Harmony
BATMAN
HAHAHAHAH XD
hi D_E
Y U NO APPEAR YET
Hey.
06,15I don't know, that Discord wins, or the elements of harmony win, Combustiblelemons?
He's afraid of Dr-dr-dr...
Dermathil: It turns out that canterlot was built on a giant space jellyfish, and it reunites with its mate at the end of the episode
whatpayne I'm okay with him doing that, as he does it with actos who have RANGE. As opposed to Tim Burton who does essentially has Depp play the same character for everything
OO
Transformers 1 was OK, the rest were terrible
DRAGONS
in order to "hate" a movie, it should be more than just bad
Anyone know the Mirc command to activate colors?
Well the obvious victor will be the elements of harmony
anyone who gets that reference, lol
agreed LunaTheForgotten
i needs to do something terribly wrong
omg why is there a support board if there is nooen there to help
Well, Transformers 2 was more than just bad
What RWARity said.
it all starts with one misjudgement by the supervillian.
theres almost no movie in the world that deserves "hate"
dragons taste funny
@DSNesmith I got the reference; I laughed.
Obviously it's Derpy who wins the day
Ghosties!
I AM HERE.
and alfred never aged
/me hugs Ghosties
yo
then it unwraps.
RAWRity, of course. And he can neatly not overdo it too much.
i think dragons taste pretty good :3
sup pegacorn
I BET THAT LINE WILL NEVER BE REPEATED IN THIS MOVIE.
Twilight deserves hate
06,15Hate is overrated. There are precious few things in the world that are worthy of hatred, comparatively.
okay WHO IS THIS GUY
What happened to Silversceen? Haven't seem him in awhile.
he's in like everything ever
Twilight the movies
and even if you hate a movie, its often because of something personal
I cannot remember his name
Pegacorn!? :D
witch one
RobotPinkie said it best~
Unlike Tim Burton
ohey, should we bring Pegacorn in here?
Transformers 3 left me vexed, which is better than bored/angry (Transformers 2)
BTW anybody here seen the set shots of the new Burton movie? it's hilarious.
BJORNFOT!
The falling and picking up one.
No thanks
What movie is it?
06,15Ohay Pegacorn
hullo
batman begins
There are precious few things in the world that I hate
...please don't be mad at me pegacorn D:
/me hugs RobotPinkie
Burton is making a new movie?
pffft
sure
burton
Quite obviously rincess luna will crush discord by smashing the moon into equestria
Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties Ghosties
PEGACORN
Klansmen, Westboro church, Transformers 2, war, death, pestilence..
Weee! train.
Huh?What are you talking about Bjornfot?
Oh yeah I know what this movie is, I meant the new Burton one
Oh look exposision
right now, theres only one director that i can say that i "hate"

Who is that playing Bruce's dad?
Klansmen are still relevant?
Does Grundle hate the Smooze?
I wish gotham existed.
Not gonna lie: wish I could live in Gotham

You see, Pegacorn... Me and Ghosties kinda... uhh...
Before Gotham became Chicago.

Smooze is pretty cool guy
6But you can't escape the smooze
Burton is doing a modern remake of "Dark Shadows"
This is typical children's entertainment, no? :P
lol sounds like they're were saying MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY XD
I wonder what they were on when they designed the smooze.

this kid's such a wuss
Nittany_Discord: You'll see at the end.

i can tell because sad music is playing
6What page are you on?

THEN BRUCE BECAME CUBONE
Sitting in a chatroom during such moments never works though. :P

Dammit Bruce. You get scared at the theatre, and your parents die.

Joker killed his parents in Batman: TAS

6Like, give me the whole url
hes so awesome
dat young looking gary oldman
he's taking the death of his parent's awfully well
This new chat layout is.. less colorful o.o
Gary Oldman has been in every movie we've seen for the past 3 weeks.
I'd be a puddle of tears and pee
I miss our colorful chat.
lol
O.o
I don't lag at all untill 800+ people come
lol @ young Gary Oldman
He wasn't in Blade Runner.
Was he really in Blade Runner?
Joker didn't kill the Waynes in TAS. He did in the Burton film however.
it's kinda dead here though :/
Gary Oldbrony.
i know it happens to me all the time
n the late 20th and early 21st century, many objects similar to Pluto were discovered in the outer Solar System, notably the scattered disc object Eris in 2005, which is 27% more massive than Pluto.[14] On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined what it means to be a "planet" within the Solar System. This definition excluded Pluto as a planet and added it as a member of the new category "dwarf planet" along with E
I think we can all agree his best performance was in True Romance
aponymous that's because he's just that good
Good noose?
05emmet
TLDR....
Tara Strong is going to do an awesome job as Harley Quinn.
05stop it.
at least he still has his dignity.
good nose
and money :3
cool textwall
but yeah, Gary Oldman's best performance in the last couple weeks
"You're daddy's dead but dammit we GOT EM!"
Oh, I forgot about Blade Runner, he wasn't in that...
True Romance
what i dont like about this movie that it doesnt seem to really know what its trying to do, which results in an extremly boring second half
there was 1000+ last time i still didnt get lag :P
he was in My Little Pony?
6...I like colors. =D
probably
We'll be watching the empire!
The origins of the emperor
He voiced the SMOOOZE
=O hax!
Q ftw.
Who is that guy?
A movies I meant...
that's why he hates the republic
Teeth is an awesome B movie.
Seems familiar.
"Well, your dad's dead, but at least you've got job security."
Rutger Hauer was in Bladerunner
lol XD
cheer up, emo Bruce
Glory to the empire
07,1teeth is scary...
very well
07,1it gave me nightmares..
Oh ok.
Michael Caine is the rock of stability in everything he's in
Teeth was hilarious.
Alfred!
there is the tears.
k helps to be on the right page
05teeth is jsut, unpleasant. nothig more nothing less
6Teeth...
but no pee
I love Zulu
6*shudder*
Well I'm probably far away from the server
teeth is like the human centipede
Of course it's your fault Bruce.
disgusting
Ohai, Sprinkles.

It's all your fault, Bruce, you pussy!
and nothing mroe
That movieâ€¦*shivers*
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED TO BLOW THE BLOODY DOORS OFF!
Alfred is best pony
TheMaster: A
my favorite parts in this movie is when hes training and stuff, and getting ready to kick ass
Your fault, your fault
I've heard of Teeth, and having heard of it, i don't want to see it.
6Teeth is none of the above
6Ever.
lol Dari
he probably peed when his parents died
teeth is ridiculous to me. I mean, HOW MANY TIMES CAN A PERSON BE RAPED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
Anyone who doesn't get my reference.
whew helps to be on the rght page!
GTFO.
:P
it has the spirit of a B movie.
LIAM NEESON <3
its not your fault...
Inb4 Teeth is next weeks B movie.
however, when actually becomes batman, it turns into a 08/15 superhero movie
Caine is godly.
05I never asked for batman
Aslan ninja is best ninja
Lawl, not Teeth.
this makes me want to watch ninja assasin
NINJAS
If I win it, next week's B will be "Nudist Colony of the Dead"
.......GODDAMNIT BJORNFOT,SAY IT ALREADY!
*You're the best, around! Nothing's ever going to bring you down!"
YAY ninja's :3
those are some crappy ninjas.
liam neeson is awesome
06,15Well, Wrek, you're not getting the Batman you ask for... but the Batman you deserve.
Dat BDSM-club

Ninjas make a good movie

Once upon a time there was a man named batman. Then his parents got dead.
Awfully quiet in Applejack.
Batman never asked for any of this.
So Hi all!
3 Is the stream already up?
if I win b-movie, we're watching Baby Geniuses 2
yes it is
My favorite musician is Batman John
Combustiblelemons What a shame

DSNesmith YOU AWFUL BASTARD

I like the quiet rooms so we can actually read all the text before it scrolls away
If I win it,the professor Layton movie
Avatar on a stream
god no
Ra's is probably my favorite Batman villian
Avatar? As a B-movie?
Why would you do that
I got the best titled b movie
Avatar would be a good B-movie
The gauntlets look cooler on Neeson than they do on Batman
I almost picked Avatar.
I still want to see labrinth as one of the movies
swordpunching!
It's a bright and colorful childrens' cartoon
Neeson makes everything cooler.
So many awesome quotes from that guy
alien vs ninja is a good b-movie
I say we have "The last Airbender" as next week's A movie
He's like the human Rainbow Dash.
Taken is a badass neeson movie
Not even dissing Batman.....yeah, what Jervill said.
Neeson made Taken worth watching
The professor layton movie comes with free puzzles
anyone else getting a server not found error when they try to connect?
he's teaching him how to be a jedi
lol RAWRity
Taken was a weird movie though
not a ninja
it was like a fps
in movie form
RAWRity: Please no
/me gives Denied_Existence_ a beter interwebs connection
06,15Indeed, DSNesmith
well I mean
Which could be interesting for cat
I love how I can't highlight anything >.<
most movies I wouldn't mind seeing twice
I say we have "The Elite Squad" as an A movie

taken was like a one-night stand of a movie
there's no smooze to hide from

Guess I should have cleared your kick count.
oh oh how about 2012 for a movie
and then he turns out to be a bad guy
2,14 stop spacing out your messages
In the mountains
The reason he fails is because midichlorians remind him of bats.
sumica nah, too long and boring
ThePretender We found a video game movie that was better than the game!
How about Shoot 'Em Up for a B movie?
Spoiler: His wife IS the mountain
06,15You mean Conviction was Taken: The Game, right ThePretender?
wait so the auto image imbedding doesn't work now?
but the world ends and stuff
midichlorians are a lie
Shoot em Up is a awesome movie
Cya guys tomorrow. Love and acceptance to you all
Sky Captain as A movie in honor of the two Sky videogame coming out in November.
Spoiler: his wife is a dumb rock
I know this has been asked a lot... but is dinkypage not working? That was the only place I could see the chat right next to the film.
no spoilers
them carrots
RAWRity: I think that movie was the only one that ever -hurt- me
that works too, RobotPinkie
the force is not an infection
the diffrince is that buggs is alredy a ninja so it wasnt that hard
this new chat sucks...
brb dinner
..the day after tomorrow, for the movie?
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Wrong site, use bronystate.net
wait... wasn't that just four messages?
also, we need to watch SHoot 'Em Up
yeah that is true
Pinkie Pie would make a good ninja.
it's 10 seconds
not in a row
I mean, jedi.
I approve of Shoot 'Em Up
flaria oh yeah, it was bad, and as a fan of A:TLA I wanted to kill Shyamalan. But it's still funny.
I was indifferent to shoot 'em up.
06,15Yeah, I do love Shoot 'Em Up
and I liked SC:C, Dashite
I mean, ninja jedi.
Albert was an old geezer even 30 years ago.
GUYS! JACKIE CHAN!
;_;
lol maybe
fluttershy would be an awesome ninja"I'm going to kill you...if it's okay"
SuperBrony64: That's where I am, but the chat is below the movie and I can't seem to turn it around.
ahahahahha shoot em up xD
WE NEED A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE!
RAWRity: Yeah, it is pretty funny-bad.
Attention anyone who doesnt like the chat: Go to www.bronystate.net/theatre/backup to use the old chat
this scene is awesome
DERPDERPDERPDERP: You can just use a separate IRC client instead
The .net isn't working for me on Firefox
Alfred never ages.
Police Story, anyone?
she's quiet enough.
DERPDERPDERPDERP: hold control, press -
oh
Alfred is the master of the criminal world of gotham
Fluttershy would be the cutest jedi/ninja
Didn't someone combine Darth Vader with ponies?

Jackie Chan the animated series rocked.
Cop Out? Why sure
2012 is almost a B movie.
RobotPinkie you're right. He's better than Batman.
Hot Fuzz, hell yes
WALL-E for A movie
this piano part
Agreed TheMaster
Bugs life for B movie
Soâ€¦Bruce Wayne becomes the thing he feared most?
soooo what is his fortune built on?
Wall-E would be great
How about some Commando, that'd be a fun A movie.
I angered the autokick bot
you guys really should get your stuff straight when it comes to the definition of B-Movie
I can never get enough of Wall-E
I'm gonna return at 20:30.Seeya all later!
indeed, SuperBrony
True, there's only 150 people in Bronystate tonight.
Wall-E was one of my favorite Pixar movies.
Leon The Professional for A movie. We need more Gary Oldman.
06,15Depends on what movie, Dashite... Snake in Eagle's Shadow? Sure :P
Wall-E is great, indeed

Anyone who is wondering: THE B MOVE IS 'BABES IN TOYLAND"
SuperBrony64 oh...oh god.

Which version of "Babes in Toyland?"
Tekken?
05tekken doesnt count
Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva
05becasue its awesome
RAWRity: Now you know how I felt when it was announced :P
RobotPinkie it was amazingly cheesy sure, but I dunno about awesome. :p
Babes in Toyland? Is that like Babe the pig?

Feel your hate
So was that guy in the court the one who murdered his parents?

This movie gets better once he becomes batman :P
Fine for me
Nope. Stream's fine.
5by5 here
the hobo, I mean. Is he in something else?
its a good decision that the dark knight abandoned the concept of gotham beeing some kind of futuristic city
Stream is fine for me
2,14 and then bruce became a negotiator, and found a giant fighting robot
...'sa nice coat
ValtheJean: <3
Sometimes, lies are easier to take.

This movie is still better than The Hulk
And then everyone died.
"Hwy. Nice coat"
b&? where
The end.
I don't even know what's happening
05and then, android women
Yay for reference-time? :P
Hobo with a shotgun
And then Bruce travelled to dream valley to find the flutterponies
big O,staring in 5..4...3..
Sometimes lies are delicious
/me would like a nice coat
And then the hobo became Batman

Stuff is happening.
This movie is better than, uh

Batman & Robin
07,1So who have seen this movie before?
Who said the Hulk is better? lol
Pluto and Charon are sometimes described as a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body.
Bruce Wayne is the male version of Lara Croft.
Once a very long time ago
chicks dig giant robots
Are they really coming out with a movie based on Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots?
Mmm, lie-flavored cupcakes!
Lara Croft is the female version of Bruce Wayne

Bruce Wayne is the non-Chuck Norris version of Chuck Norris
I kinda wish they explained what he was doing more
to tell you the truth, i dont like this movie that much
/me hugs AllisZero
A sweet mixture of guilt, shame, and strawberry frosting.
And then Bruce became Iron Man
Stole from himself. Nice.
how about rainbow flavoured cupcakes
Anyone else using this small chat?
you can fill in some of the blanks, but it's still really vague
conquer fears?laugh at them
no.
And then Bruce became a ninja.

Ghosties: Drake kicks ass too.
They are too spicy.
Dat Opium
Also, @Luna: Me too.
And then Bruce changed his name to Kakashi Hatake and cut out his left eye.
and then Bruce became a jedi
lol ValtheJean :D
and this is where Liam Neeson's Jedi training comes in handy
inb4 giggle at the ghostie
This movie is kinda disappointing
And then Bruce became a girl.
Bruce therefore wins due to the rule of Conservation of Ninja. The more Ninja there are, the weaker they get.
05so much squeakign latex
My brain is reading my Giggle At The Ghostie in Liam Neeson's voice

So the entire Batman series of movies is a halucination dream from when Bruce is at a monk temple?
wy laughing so hard?
Fear juice, it's a hell of a drug
Aah! Bats on my face!
Those drugs gave him ninja-vision
you cant compare transformers to batman begins
When I'm rich and powerful I'll keep army of ninjas standing by all the time
punish those turtles
he is SOOO high.
AHH NOT THE BATS
You are now an assassin.
they are two completely different things
THERE IN MY EYES
I like Begins, but yeah. Dark Knight improves on it in every way.
I absolutely LOVED the first scene at the docks with Batman!
THEY
BATS, BATS EVERYWHERE
Now we are a family again
rofl
this is one of my favorites scenes in this movie
Goon: Where are you!
Wait so Bruce multi-classes to rogue at this point?
as soon as he has the batman costume, this movie turns into a bad 08/15 superhero movie
"Join the Dark Side, Bruce"
Batman: Here.
and worst of all:
must be a fun test
we have cookies
it gets soooo broing
-to whisper yet somehow still be heard
"We have cookies"
DAMNIT TURGLE! :P
This is kind of awesome
This is a weird ass training montage
so what is the point of this training?
*boring
xD
04NO QUI-GON
suddenlt bats
04I DON'T WANNA
Bats in my facer
BATS
"Ra's al Guhl said that wasn't the way to deal with fears at all..."
Not the bats!
Like looking into a 3Ds
04YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE JEDI
Aaaa not the bats my eyes
To tell the truth, I was really bored watching TF3
those bats~
Rofl
And then Bruce learned how to build a Lightsaber
hiya Ghosties :3/
We totally put a bunch of bats in a box and took them all the way up the mountain just so we could do that. SO worth it.
yeah, but TF3 is trying to accomplish something different
04Hello
and it works well for most people
Bats in the mountains
this movie fails in what its trying to do
Ow
how do you keep that many bats in one box?
"He said, Brucie, you have to stand up tall, learn to face your fears"
wait these arent bats, there! Tickets to the GGG!
I never find this boring, but there definitely alot more Bruce face time in this one
messed up game of duck duck goose.
the box was made by a timelord
Timelord technology.
IT'S A TRAP
clever
i also feel like this movie is tooo long
PWND
and now these tickets are diamonds
sweet
impressive
NOPE IT'S CHUCK TESTA
Hurray! Shia Lebough wins!
ponies gunna pwn
and it has some of the worst action ever
and now shit gets kinky
yay,cutie mark!
*troll face*
aww heeells yeah.
Like my bat box, didn't you?
crap, I need to get my pizza out of the oven.
ah time to get your cutie mark bruse
inb4 b&
If this movie fails, then why was it so poular and like 2 times as good as the previous tries?
Thank you EmmettBrown. Batman, ponies, and science. What more could I ask for.
I saw a League of Shadows on Spiral Knights
that is how we do it
Incoming random criminal.
who says its 2 times as good?
*popular
you must take this sword, bruce
shave his beard with this sword
DERPDERPDERPDERP: Uncharted
moral dilemmas!
tim burtons batman movies are far superior
And then Bruce became Judge Dredd
and permaban this troll
It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
everywhere.
lol uncharted
Touche
its so popular because critics say its good
Everyone, except perhaps the original Batman movie
what's the 2nd movie tonight?
We should see Sahara before Uncharted comes out.
isn't this Saito
dilemmas, moral dilemmas everywhere!
babes in toyland
yep
OMG you are like so the black sheep
Hey everypony, I finally get a chance to enjoy Brony Movie Night after weeks of waiting
To defeat evoh
saito ftw
yes, happypony
also, the transformers movies are also extremly popular, even alot more popular than these ones
>Trains Ninjas
he was also in The Last Samurai ;_;
he will buy the entire airplane line
he has better taste in inception
>To kill muggers
The Burton films were terrible in all senses
back on later, have to get some work done :)
does that say anything about the quality?
no run for your life!
no it doesnt
CircuitMane, nice name
Gotham's number has been drawn
Aroud to die
04Dude, what the fuck is up with those hanging cotton lines on your mouth?
I am an asian stereotypu
ohai CircuitMane
You probably thought this guy was a murderer. Nope, just chuck Testa.
ttfn everypony
true
so...gotham is as bad as usuall
Ghosties: YES.
later stripes
"popularity" says nothing about a movie
05torch them ghosties, torch them all!
IMPOSSIBRU
/me hugs stripes goodnight
League of Shadows, Lawful Evil?
that voice
Wow, he's the Joker!
hi tosha
Sleep well!
cya ctrlx
great you join us
lol
Ra's has fashionable facial hair
ROR
Hey Circuit, watch your show all the time, just not on Mondays, lol
And Then Bruce changed his name to Obi-Wan Kenobi
so wait they teach him there ways and make him all super but never checked to see if he was down with the plan?
hi
man I cannot unsee EspyLacopa's secret identity
04Who the hell says "You know what, I wanna style my facial hair like a drunkely shaved sheep?"
I hear Liam Neeson returnrs for a cameo in TDKR
Take this: it's dangerous to go alone.
Holy crap. The conversation's kind of kicked off in here.
chow yun fat?
That's my name, I love it and live it!
05DAT LATEX SQUEAK
no
~lol~~~~~ <drowning man
don't do it :(
JUST KIDDINg
if you want to go into the big chat, simply click on "Bronystate" next to the "Pinkie_Pie" chat at the bottom
i keep forgetting it
MMMM LATEX
im prolly just gonna lurk in here :P
well that sure was lucky
over 100 people in the big one
OHai fire.
?
you can here his latex stretching...
>Doesn't want to kill people
>Blows up Building
Ghosties: Discord?
05kills all then injas
Despite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.
lol
his secret anagram name
Forgetting whta?
*demonstrates unwillingness to kill by burning down a building full of ninjas*
latex :3
Good job secrit order of nijas
04It actually looks natural on Discord
the action is this movie is terribly cut
the dream is collapsing-we MUST WAKE UP1
04But here?
hear*
04Nah, not at all
some of the worst ever
no we have to go deeper
^
We really should have watched The Dark Knight, just for the Discord references
Duuude, I have a secret anagram name?
Fenr Law of Inverse Ninja
Ghosties: Well, this is My Little Pony the live action movie...right?
Don't mess with Ra's, that guy is nuts.
Fuck cinematography. We have SUPER SHAKY CAMERAS
The difference being that he's fighting people who are fighting back with the ninjas, not just executing someone.
if we go deeper we will have more time!
Some of it
good thing this is not trying to be an action movie to 100%
...You're making that up.
fiverhippo we already watched it though.
Conservation of Ninjitsu, dammit
he's gone
oh, well, nevermind, lol
REALLY shouldn't have saved him.
nice scream from the asian XD
conservation of ninjutsu...right,i guess
this is only my second movie night
in the massive fireball
Weeee!
Dari, Joker fought back, didn't kill him.
In hindsight... this might not be such a good idea
But the first and last scenes where Batman fights are the best of all those before it
You killed all the ninjas D:
riiiiight, they survived that....
you know Nolan movies have a pretty distinct style in how they are shot.
Don't just kill one person, kill all the persons
what many people dont realize: Its just as hard to make a great action scene as it is to write a great character
Slippeh slide
Twilight/Applejack moment
of course
Owie.
KNIVES DON'T WORK THAT WAY.
Let go.
...why the hell is it EXPLODING?
no we need to go shalower then come back after this is done super fast from our prespective
sounds painful
in fact, it might be even harder to create an amazing action scene than it is to write a great character
And then Bruce saves the one person who will turn around and screw everything up.
That's why you have screenwriters
but now i cant stop thinking about Ninja Assassin...
Bruce: Just let goâ€¦trust me.
And then his arm ripped from his socket and Neeson fell to his death anyway
Let go, sugarcube. Trust me!
And then Bruce became the Element of Honesty
it's the smoke powder
The end
Friday nights are the "OMGponiestomorrow" night
it caught on fire
Lasharus: fireworks obv
Good to see you.
like a batman
I know it sounds crazy, but I've got a plan.
Ah, of course. Thanks happypony.
a great character is something you can think through
That's quite some gunpowder.
guess things can explode twice...
dat arm strength
That explains a great deal. :P
Strong enough to bench press a ninja!
but action needs to come all from talent
At the simplest level, one can examine the two orbits and see that they do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.
has the latest episode ran yet?
...I want to know now too.
dojos can explode twice
nolan movies don't have random explosions, they always have a reason
and intuition for good cinematography
what's the plan
yes you coming up with a plan dose sound crazy
Sorry,thought that was short
So how 'bout dem neutrinos, guys?
Oh manâ€¦my back is hurting right now...:(
You fall and die, then I trollface!
and its not something you can really "learn"
Bruce has parts of all elements in him
well except that car at the start of inception
Requires additional science
suddenly: plane
not sure why that blew up
seems legit
Zephirdd: XD
my favorite Nolan movie is Momento
Part from the mad
plane from inception?
nice plan
I'm pretty sure that happypony is just making that up.
i swear it's the same plane
are they doing a marathon, or no? and are they doing the new ep
anyone, latest episode today or tomorow?
elephants.
hmmmm
tachyons, the troll particle
tomorrow at 9am est
i agree
I love Michael Cain
screw the city, aquire money.
mib_leeoo4: tomorrow is s2e2
k, back... DAMMIT
04Oh yeah, faster than the speed of light right dari?
many people dont realize how different this movie actually is from the dark knight
cheers!
Yeah Ghosties.
g2g. sorry
the dark knight drops soo many ideas from this movie
Wait, what's the name of this movie?
04Read about that earlier
Go tachyons.
I picked a stupid time to cute my pizza
U MAD Einstein?
Symbols are bullet proof mr creedey...i mean, Alfred.
deliopen: Batman Begins
04@deliopen: Batman Begins
In europe and east of it : Today
Batman Begins, deliopen
wait, dari found a way to completely hide /nick changes in #bronystate now ? o_0
"Something elemental, something terrifying... Something with four legs and bright pink hair."
Alfred is best butler.
Ninja'd!
04What's your take on it, dari?
05ah selfish old butler eh?
Ah, thought it was Blade Runner there for a second.
thanks master bruce...really...
hi everyone; 12 hours until twilight kicks discord's butt? ;)
Only in the embedded client?
Dirty clothes, dirty face, still, styled hairs.
Alfred, LIKE A BAWS
cool
04OH SHIT
5 meat stuffed pizza. What a monster
interesting, I wonder if Alfred still owns all that money in the next movie
HIM
What's the full title of this film again?
Batman Begins?
04IT'S THAT GUY
Dark Knight seems to try and stick Batman and Joker in the "real" world. This is nearly as immersed in its fantasy elements as the Tim Burton movies.
i love he
Zasz cameo!
04Except
04wait
oh, duh
*him
OMGOMG
I hear they're remaking Batman Begins, they're gonna call it "Batman Continues"
to the moooooon he goes
I think Jean Wilder would be a great batman
Ghosties: I believe that the uncertainty in their results is large enough such that it's likely the neutrinos weren't traveling faster than light.
that makes more sense >_<
04He's not as badass as Scarecrow from Arkham Asylum
What's the movie lineup for tonight?
to EqD
Facebook teaser? Same as the youtube one?
O hai, Cillian
13
Wow that guy with the glasses looks like he should have his ass kicked.
04I thought the margin of error was like less than 2% or something
indeed
Caaaarrrlll
2% might be enough.
04Indeed
however, the problem in this movie is that it also tries to be realistic, and it just doesnt work
batman,still in early concept as hoboman
comes off as weird to me
Don't watch that teaser, it's a spoiler
04IN SCIENCE, NOTHING IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED!
Pluto's mass is 1.31Ã—1022 kg, less than 0.24 percent that of the Earth, while its diameter is 2,306 (+/- 20) km, or roughly 66% that of the Moon
For science!
BAT
Bat!
EmmettBrown: That's what Derpy would say
a bat!
IM MATBAN
okay I lol'd at that pinkie conscience comic
yeah that's right sorry lol
TO THE MOOOOOON
I'd rather not believe that it's true Ghosties.
Guys
04Why not?
Otherwise my physics course is just fucking blown out the window.
04Oh
lolz
04Well
If that bat hadn't showed up
Bats fly WAY more rapidly in a house
Then I get to hear my teacher say
We'd have Hoboman
>all we've learnt
>it's wrong
XD
yep
You know how a lot of windows have a screen on the outside so you can have a window open but still keep bugs out?
Face your fears batman
We'd have the motherfucking HOBOMAN
Everything you know is wrong~
don't they say that all the time anyway
I'm not paying attention, what's the debate that's going on?
if I was alfred I'd start dumping water down there
SCIENC
E
enjoy physic course
we have lost a great thing thanks to that bat
the concept of hoboman is actually rather interesting
EspyLacopa: Yeah?
neutrinos going faster than light, SuperBrony64
Giggle at the bats bruce.
04Apparently if it is true, then science isn't ready just yet to discard Einstein's theory since it's held up for so long
lol
6...I am Hoboman
they should make a movie out of that
Last year, when I woke up one morning, I found a bat snoozing in the space between the window and the mesh.
It is called a well, sir
D'awwww
Dr Insano, the Master of SCIENCE!
Anyone seen hobo with a shotgun?
we'll never discard einstein's theory, but we may modify it
D'awww
Special relativity is extremely accurate. I wouldn't throw it away. Gallileian relativity hasn't quite been thrown away yet.
If the writing on ep 2 is as awesome as ep 1 *sqee*
I'm aware of this invention
All laws have rebels right?
It was adorable.
There should be water in it
Hobo with a shotgun is a pretty good movie
goriest film I've ever seen.
Neutrinos don't go faster than light, they travel NEAR the speed of light through all matter almost undistrubed.
6Anyone seen a hobo with a broadsword?
I didnt have the heart to kick out the snoozing bat.
I haven't
EspyLacopa awesome. :D
But as you can see, there is water right here.
RainBro said that about halfway through one of my physics modules the experiments with the large hadron collider will be finished, and that'll prove something like half of my physics module to be either right of wrong.
That's what alfred would be saying
This event inspires him to become: Owlman!
Never trust a Scientist, who knows when they will just change the laws
I used to live under a colony of bats
Hence, no need for more.
Hobo with a military grade mine clearer
Ghosties, it most likely isn't true, since they went over the speed of light by a time shorter than the number of decimals they have rounded it by.
has the LHC done ANYTHING useful yet
well, the CERN dudes believe the new experiment could prove them FASTER than light
LHC is finished.
So all my shit has 2 chances of being screwed up.
techdude300: What about Catman?
/me shrugs
you probably though those bats were real
DAT LEIFMOTIF
I haven't heard about it since all the 'end of the world' nonsense
i wonder if all the bats are cgi
So what if he was frightend by a horse when he was a kid?
It's just not been tested at full power yet.
nope
04I'm not a science major
But can you drop a bucket into the well and get water? Nope, just Chuck Testa
And then Bruce constructed a Suit made of living Bats and called himself BATSUIT
Nittany_Discord: Yeah, but conclusions drawn from the results or whatever, I dunno.
He's changes every 10 weeks
No obviously they fired the writers after episode one
04So, I'm not too concerned
Neutrinos are very difficult to measure as they really can't be detected easily unless something gets deflected because of it.
So when is the LHC firing up again?
Ratman is due in April
lol
LHC is doing great stuff. Most of chat don't understand what they do exactly entails.
I heard so many things about why it broke
6...what if when he was a kid...
they smash things together really fast
anybody read the webcomic Ratfist?
Dermathil, i know i sure don't!
6he was scared by Sea Ponies?
there's an app for that
I though all LHC did was smash particles together at high speed or something?
Even one that the universe itself is stopping the experiment from working.
;o
05seaponyman!
Seaponyman for the win.
It does.
HE'S GOT NO SUPERPOWERS! HE'S Just a Flyin' RAAAAT!
Shoo be doo
Aquaman was scared of Sea Ponies
Seaponarang!
He was bit by Lyra seapony while young.
SirSprinkles: I don't know. <3
04Strap her down to watch MLP Newborns, that'll shut her mouth...or drive her insane
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
:D
there's a pony for that
Astronomers, assuming Pluto to be Lowell's Planet X, initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus.
Yay :D
It's a good thing we've got Arkham cuz he really drives us bats!
LHC studies these collisions and tries to find the "higgs boson" or god particle.
What movie is on tonight after this one?
yup yup yup
..and start selling mass murder weapons *calls tony stark*
Meanwhile is a sea pony
emmettbrown, give us trivia on a REAL planet
04Damn, I can't wait till next month
tony stark xD
:|
I am, but don't tell anyone.
Arrrrrgh, I HATE it when people call higgs boson the god particle
cause wayne is getting some that's why
04Arkham City is gonna be freaking awesome
that's such a stupid media-driven line of bull
sorry to disappoint xD
dat quip
I hate it when people call the god particle the higgs boson >:O
Meanwhile, do you want a seapony text tone? :3
I love that line
I'm back
Ghosties: With Tara Strong playing Harley Quinn, you bet :P
happypony: both dont exist, whats the difference? :D
Arkham City looks amazing
;)
Yes Flaria, yes i do.
ba dum tish
a job at my own company...maybe i'm asking too much
I'm waiting to get it on the Wii U though :P
04Definitely, SuperBrony64. That's an awesome extra bonus
FOX!
it's not that, it's that they're implying that finding the boson will solve everything ever
he's the boss
>Wii U
I want to work for MORGAN FREEMAN
Hey Morgan :D
God on his day off
MORGAN FREEMAN
just wait. after the release we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
morgon freeman!
OMG
same here :3
:D
YES!
I don't just do planets,I do moons,stars,planets,dwarf planets,binary planetary system,solar systems,galaxies,black holes,white holes,wormholes,space itself.All sortd of things
It's him!
Lucius Fox vs Lucius Malfoy
Morgan Freeman
Ohai God.
I didn't know he was in this movie.
the batbin,more or less
Fox
morgan freeman makes everything awesome
and now the reason why this is truly a great movie, Mr. Freeman
RED
*worships gordan feeman*
Wait, this is a sexy contest, right?
Morgan Freeman creates cyber dolphins
lol
Batman has God on his side, that's why he always wins.
04But the idea of a fully functioning sandbox open world instead of a linear setting is going to be fucking righteous
Was that facebook? :P
Bruce Wayne is just as shocked to see Morgan Freeman as we are
"and so the batman began his journey through the gotham underworld."(Freeman vioce"
dat facebook
Morgan Freeman, who was Gordon Freeman's brother, wet on platform down to teh basebment.
i love these parts of this movie
Sandboxen are over-rated
Morgan Freeman can get you stuff in jail
oh luna, y u so popular
If it isnt, Fox may turn it into one anyways.
probably my favorite part of the movie
EmmettBrown, what binary star has the fastest orbit?
someone got a facebook ping
04And yes, hello Morgan. You is mah favorite actor ever
05ghosties
so why did he show him that besides exposision?
07,1guilty!
I can't wait to see Luna tomorrow
/me sagely nods
04Wrek?
Morgan Freeman whould narrate a pony episode
05your face when i get batman arkham city with my graphics card
should
Malfoy has a pimp cane, though...
05included
Seems legit
spelunking.
Spelunking.
*not sure if serious*
Spelunking /is/ rather dangerous.
Taliban caves
04varyingdegreesofwant
Morgan Freeman should voice everypony
RX J0806.3+1527
hehehehe... Clever Morgan is clever.
just wait. after the release of Arkham City we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
Never know what you'll run into. Havent you played Cave Story?
wait did he...
The caves are serious business
04I'm getting it for the 360
Bitches love a latex-suit
The Descent
04So
Spelunking is dangerous - you might encounter skeletons, zombies or even creepers! :P
Tim Curry for transexual Transylvanian Batman.
04Doesn't bother me all that much
HOW CONVENIENT
also Fanart
I love Alfred's reaction. :P
06,15I would love to go spelunking with Batman.
charming xD
"Charming"
Morgan Freeman, who made "Magical Negro" nearly his entire career description
/me approves of dari's commment.
Morgan Freeman didn't hit it big until his 50s?
or endermen or silverfish
well if it's qall mine then lets box it up and send it to my cav.....er house
The Bat Cave!
The bat cave :D
oh dear god-not the creepers!
suddenly
music
Don't think the armor helps with lava though.
YAH DAT LOOKS SAFE
that's a nice batcave you got there
i love alfred's irony
and sarcasm
I'm getting Ace Combat instead of Arkham City
SPOILER ALERT: the next episode has ponies in it
it'd be a shame if anything happened to it.
omg
damn gummy
Damn you
~If I run out of pluto trivia,I will start doing charon trivia instead
04Whoa
so much natural light for an underground cave...
That detracts
But does it have Discord?
It also has Luna in it
You miserable bastard Gummy.
04We just went RE5 for a moment
What's the name of the actor that plays the butler?
SPOILER ALERT: also, discord does stuff
Charon has trivia? x.x
Micheal caine
Isn't Charon a dormant Mass Relay?
it's just a ball of ice
You just ruined it for me gummi i wanted to be suprised!
spray paint black armor black
Malfoy also wears a dress.
Why's he spraypainting black armour black?
makes sense
Jervill: it is.
In 1955 Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of the Earth, with further calculations in 1971 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.
EmmettBrown: Maybe save the trivia for whne it's relevant to the conversation?
Needs to be blacker
I mean, isn't that just a BIT superfluous?
:I
to make it more black
to hide the batnipples
04WE NEED TO GET DARKER
it's SMOOTH black
...and I'm back
Because it wasn't totally black.
ME GUSTA
Emmett...
Because Black Lasharus
Ghehe.
I don't think the pimp cane works well with a dress.
We need to go BLACKER!
What did I miss
what are the pony eps tonight?
Turn off that bleedin' facebook tab already! :P
This music really helps the movie
it would be better if it was rainbow
The only guy who pulls off that kind of dress well is Jude Claude Frollo.
10k pieces
at least we'll have spares....
Rarity proved dresses are manly though.
Good thing Im a billionaire idiot
that was a standard black batman
Hmmm
*Judge
yes. yes indeed.
10,000 tetrahedrons?
Oh hi Gordon
by ordering 10k
>Jude Claude, r63 Hunchback character
aaaah, Flass
<3 this guy
Gordon aged pretty well, lol
Correction 20% cooler
Trending?
I just noticed the guy from breaking bad looks like Gary Oldman
"Hey guys, look! Somebody ordered 10.000 latex-masks. That sounds legit."
Nittany_Discord: you mean 10 Gigahedrons
like Twitter?
6I love trending!
/me looks at EQD
He's not a rat, he;s a vampire!

At least he doesn't sparkle.
needs more trending up it EQD!
Yeah, it's Twitter
That's not how units work. :p

what are the ponie episodes tonight?
Batman > spiderman.
Golden Age Batman, you mean
Gordon is best pony
stapler of death
trend ALL the tweets!
04It's the pimp from True Romance
Ya know, that mask is goofie, but still better than West's Batman
I suppose I could slow down with the trivia...
he's so black
04LEVERAGE
04OH SHIT
no, ME3 is the guy who did.... uh
04IT'S ON NOW
No he isn't.

Okay thanks
He's not?
that's overused in every trailer ever
Dat stapler
batman hasn't perfected his scary voice yet
OH SHIT
