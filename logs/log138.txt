dari, can I set mode +kb on Kotick, please?
06,15for consoles, though?
*cough*ubisoft*cough*
ID and Tripwire have said that they supported always-on DRM.
SecuROM is a piece of shit rootkit that deserves to be annihilated from orbit
BACK
:D
Done buy call of duty
dont
06,15I have CoD4, it's pretty good.
CoD4 campaign.
I stopped palying after WAW (5)
I loved CoD 4.
06,15Yeah I don't play CoD online...
I've never played 3 or 6.
5 was the last of the orginal COD franchise
06,15Campaign is great though
I've played some online.
The pack of dogs was the best thing ever.
Mw2 is a mess.
MW2 I like as well.
06,15well.... part of it is great
06,15There's a fairly long section that I found kinda awful
I had both MW1 and 2
same
I took them both to the store after I finished the campaign that was piece of crap
MW2 I liked the multiplayer.
Because SnD, quickscopes.
multiplayer wise
It was fun, I can't deny.
the only reason why COD stays in business is because people buy it hoping to be good
but even whens its not, its doesnt matter becasue they already bought it
Campaign was average.
06,15I feel kinda like a fanboy for saying Killzone is my favorite FPS series :P
I remember back with 2 and 3 when it was 2 or 3 years before one came out
Zombies was fun.
THOSE WAS DIFFERENT TIMES
WERE*
06,15KZ2 has the dumbest plot in the history of the world, though.
All FPSs are going MP-centric.
I don't follow the franchises I used to anymore.
Like GoW, Halo, or Resistance.
Too damn expensive to anyway.
^ I agree
Timesplitters FTW
I don't have a preference.
I loved Timesplitters.
Especially #2.
TIMESPLITTERS
06,15I prefer my FPS games with motion controls, lolololol
Fuck YES
TROLOLOLLLLLLLL
/me is listening to Anaconda at the moment
lol I did that oevr someone elses house becasue i dont have a PS2 anymore, was quite fun
06,15KZ3 pretty much cemented it.
then 2 weeks >..>
I'm out bronies~
FPSs on Wii.
Eugh.
night night
NOT WANT
Sleep well :3
06,15Most have really shit controls...
oops spelling erropr
06,15Same on PS3, unfortunately... I don't get it, like couldn't they just give all the code for controls to developers?
Shitty controls are hardly restricted to the Wii.
Meh move.
Hiya, you.
Move is a wiimote with a flashing bobble on top.
I dont like how there trying to force Motion Control on us, Just like 3D, I HATE 3D and grenades but thats another story'
06,15That goes for both Wii motion + and Move
just its expensive to upkeep
School's out! Time for Ponies! How's it going everypony?
awe :<
For me, motion controls are a great idea.
http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=294
although 360 isn't hard either
But they just don't work.
and wii is just pathetically easy
At least the 3DS isn't as bad as the Virtual Boy.
They seem like a great idea, pretty much everyone bought a wii.
And the Wii's motion control is far superior to the Power Glove.
06,15Pffft, motion controls work great in the right games.
It was kind of just a novelty thing.
It's worn off.
i'd rather have surround view
I still use mine. :/
that's more imersive than motion sensing
Back to the ole Virtual Boy debate huh?
Hey guys,
06,15lawl, Virtual Boy debate.
What's there to debate?
06,15There were 3D graphics in the 80's, too :P
http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/113229-SCOTUS-To-Blame-For-Sonys-Terms-of-Service-Changes
#D goes back to the beginning of time.
3D*
there were color Televisions back when it was invented!
but oh well
You mean 0D
. = 0D. - = 1D. Shape = 2D.
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/stereoscopic1903b.jpg <-- Ye Olde 3D
06,15I like 3D, I like motion controls... I know that among gamers that usually means I'm in the minority, but eh...
Technology doesn't just come out of thin air like at an Apple keynote. There are a lot of technologies that are fully developed but haven't become cost-effective enough for the consumer market.
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/jaipur/jaipurcity/streets1903.jpg <-- Have some more Ye Olde 3D.
I take 3D to mean like 3D films.
Ye Olde 3D?
You mean flat 3D games? XD
The biggest flaw with 3D films is how they choose the focus the action.
06,15I like 3DTV, lets put it that way.
the biggest flaw is that there are really only two depths
I don't like 3D films.
near and far
I hate the focus thing!
I think the 3D adds nothing.
06,15I think it's generally pointless for movies, though
And all it DOES do is screw up the colour/quality of the film
06,15For games, it does add quite a bit
i think it adds something. but it's just not enough
3D movies give me headaches. :/
games it does add more
For example, if you remember those seed…things, that float around all the time, they are extremely out of focus while the background is in focus (as to where the action is).
06,15For ponies, I don't think 3D would add anything.
Good night everyone.
Good night Dari
Anyway, I think 3D adds a lot of effect to movies/games. It isn't REQUIRED, but it certainly makes a movie more appealing for me.
Eugh 3d
I dont like 3D
/me is gone
I don't mind 3D..
It screws up my eyes
06,15I think it's mostly for games, really... Much easier to see where you're jumping exactly, or where everything is.
usually strains them, then I cant see 2 feet in front of me for probably about 4 hours
lol
Worse than the headaches I get. :p
my eyes are normally fine, but 3D
UGH
Discussion on 4chan brightened up my day.

Which seems to have been disproven lately

Mentioning a live Republican candidate debate on YT sponsored by Fox News.
Lol.
Fox news the only station where I have the urge to take a folding chair to the back of each of there heads.
whoah whoah whoah
One candidate was talking about how he survived colon cancer (stage 4) only because of privatized health care.
why am i using 5.3gb of ram
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
Because he could get timely treatment.
My reaction to FOX.
Exactly.
He didn't have to have fun with insurance because he could pay for it out-of-pocket.
Kudos for beating cancer, but don't say that you beat cancer because you wouldn't get timely care under govt. health care when you got it only because you didn't have to deal with insurance.

I just looked up Babes in Toyland. It's rated 4.9 out of 10.
Which version?
'34, '61, '86, or '97?
'86
They made a movie like that in '34?
The '34 version apparently had Laurel and Hardy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(1934_film)
Damn I want that one then.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Toyland_(operetta)
From 1903.
If you guys won the lottery, which movies would y'all pick?
Grave of the Fireflies and Fantastic Adventures of Unico
this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQDe3DFv-Dw
probably anyway.. i can't think of anything else i would rather
arashi no yoru ni
Sorry, I don't know anything about japanease movies
Is this an A-movie or a B-movie?
imo it's quite A quality
it's also anime
I would watch it.
Grave of the Fireflies I know is an A movie.
that's why the name is still japanese despite it being in english
never played it myself
I played it yesterday for the first time in like ten years.
I went from a SNES, to a PS2, to having a Gamecube.
I forgot how motion sick it can make you.
And I didn't get the SNES until the n64 had been out for a bout a year.
Link to the Past.

I guess ponies is actually on TV in the US though
that helps

right beneath Germany, at that
aussies and their weird timezone and all
server stats
The US is way up there.
it is

CERN: http://i.imgur.com/cDvnU.jpg
I saw a pretty interesting comparison the other day
There was a supernova, few thousand light years away, back in 1987
The neutrinos showed up 3 hours before the light of the explosion did
if I do recall my astrophysics course correctly
But this guy's point was that if the scale had been the same, we'd seen the neutrinos in 1984 and the light only in 1987
err...
>_>
<_<
no physicist here
Eh, neither am I, but I thought it was an interesting point
It'll take more than a few subatomic particles acting erratically to shatter special relativety I think
relativity*
Yep
In that case the comparison with the neutrinos coming from supernova years earlier is correct then.
light speed is the limit
there are ways around it
take hyperspace for one
(actual hyperspace not scifi)
it is
damn it!
I did it again!
hello Luna ^_^
07,1yea...
>_> you guys are evil for making me break character
do you want a vhost Luna?
07,1vhost?
At the moment no one knows.
07,1sure :)
07,1hmmm let me think of that :)
sure, I'm generally around
us Admins are always watching...
O_O
/me hides the plans to take over the world
oh
BOOM
or even into a medium with a different refractive index?
Please hold... computing...
No no. I believe in scientific method. Until proven othervise Light is still the constant.
it's not though
it depends of permitivity and permiability
but it always depends on only those two factors
if n<0 then you can send messages through time XD
The speed of light in vacuum is physical constant
when permitivity = permiability = 0?
yes
Sorry, but my physics knowlege is quite lacking in this area tbh.
07,1streams up
the theory of relativity (not the special theory) explains the spatial distortions that also affect it
and I'm taking a year off XD
...and I;\'m back
Haha xkcd
*I'm*
I've said that already...
/me comes back with food
/me waves back
I spent 3 hours debugging code
No problemo. It's nice to know someone is interested enough to actually study these matters
hmm... maybe I did go a bit too technical
By brain can't handle math/physics today...
it comes naturally to me
07,1yea i did
07,1long time ago
07,1will continue in a bit :)
'later Luna
...
I thought you were
07,1no no
07,1i'm streaming :)
XD
07,1pre-pre-pre-pre show
To watch the entire movie.
Oh well that explains how you used those terms such effectively.
Well, it sure is easier that reverse DNS xD
XD
and if you're wondering, I'm 21
o_O
and this is ruining my persona as 'the approachable server admin'
XD
Usually when someone acknowleges actually studying some subject, it makes me hesitant to say anything on the matter.
Unless it's computers huh
*than
I'd be glad to listen, but unfortunately really broke.
Really? And here I thought I was awful at this area?
and it doesn't bother me
yup
:3
are you a registered nick?
ee-yup
in that case...
I got irssi idling 247
there you go
go ahead and /whois yourself
Thanks <3
On these subjects I mean.
And Wikipedia...
Well I heard he made a book recently.
Well I'll be...
It'll probably take anywhere from 10 to 15 years for affordable consumer versions?
Holograms?
at the moment they are only monochromatic
but they look like sculpters
visible from all angles
opaque
Any idea if it needs two opposite surfaces to work or just one?
just one
that looks real
until you try to touch it
to an extent
physicist suck at rendering images
*physicists
and only still images at the moment due to the extensive quantum mechanical calculations involved in displaying it
Now THAT is something I'd buy
/me hasn't seen the math
:P
(from the rendering math, you can derive all their work)
that would be an epic statue
MFW I thought that model had been 3D printed.
:D
well, the display is is QED in nature
Yes that is awesome 3D model shat sould be 3D printed.
*that
same has been done with cameras for ages though

Oh, I still use irc.ponyirc.com xD

I want Derpybot in here
Lol
18:54:28 <@DerpyBot> The next episode airs in 0d:21h:05m:30s
if you use irc.ponychat.net, you connect negligably faster :P
XD
ssh + screen + irssi <3
If you use irc.ponychat.net you're more likely to connect slower.
really?!!
o_O
that address is a pointer
Which points you to one of the servers.
that dumps you over to irc.ponychat.net

scripted banning just seems like a bad idea
WTF IS THIS
WHY
World of Warcraft is filled with Trollz
well not lost but stolen from me
is this bieber?
all is said
He…got screwed over when in Cuba...
YES grundle
Dealwithit.
I don't really play computer games
not really, it helps the mods out quite a lot
2,14 believe me: it's necessary for the S2 rush
Planescape > BG2 > bg1
06,15Oh, well, that sucks.... you should get another copy
I liked it when i played all that hours of Starcraft 2 and finaly saw Kerrigan naked.
trying to
FALLOUT3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1000+ people = hard to control
05but speaking of games, Deus Ex>any other fps released after that
yeah, with 1100 people
I can't watch anything, it keeps saying broadcast is offline
didn't i just say that?
BANJO-KAZOOIE
AWWWWWW YEEEEEAAAAAH

mibbit was lagging like shit
06,15Any other RPG FPS, yeah
2,14 I want to kiss you very manly
I got lagbooted actually
05Natleyn I never asked for that
06,15Any other FPS? No.
also, tf2 is cool
Grudle: YOU…how much I hate you right now...:P
had to stream somewhere else
that's why I'm trying my hand at mIRC, at least for typing under this nick
Lol
05what a shame
sorry, I get all my news from Eqd D:
I do. ME 1 > ME 2.
06,15WURMPLE has a butt for a face. Discuss.
06,15(or not, actually)
/me is kinda failing hard, but getting the hang of it because
If ME 3 is going to suck like Dragon's Age 2, i throw a fit.
tbut that's it
I forgot to remove the because
I like both games equally, but can't wait for ME3
Have we played Nick Cage yet?
/me was also failing hard
there was no because. I couldn't think of one
>.>
/me is using mibbit because of that
I still have 1 and 2 on 64
The manly way of playing Banjo-Kazooie was having to get ALL 100 NOTES within a single run.
>is using mibbit because of habit
when is the streaming going to start?
06,15lol
My hopes have dropped very much for SWTOR after i played DA 2.
Persona 3
05let the toying commence
ugh...dragonage
i couldn't get myself to like me1 as much as me2. because THAT FREAKING CRACK-MOBILE
My hopes have dropped very much for SWTOR when they confirmed that it was a MMO
well it is not working, how do I fix this?
whats the show tonight
also the endless booring planetsides
Hurray for this song!

Enough is enough
That actually smells a bit. Ew.
/me charges a large piece of trout

Oh wow…hunger just hit my hard right now...

Oh great.
05mfw people tohught ghosts of mars was a good movie
05thought*

06,15You guys are totally distracting me from my pokeymans
HAAW HAAW HAAW

/me hears an awesome metal song
AWW YEAH!!!
"you're gonna go far kid- Rainbow Dash"

Correction: This music is beautiful
my favorite is I'll make a Man out of You
naw

i can show you beautiful music
haven't seen that one actually
hint, look at my name
this isn't it
you haven't!?
it's got Rarity!
yep

My favorite is Moon over the castle. But I'm thinking opera isn't a favorite...
>doesn't like rarity much
hi GoldenTahu

/me is having a wonderful time without alcohol
*trollface*
Hey
Pertwee is currently one of my favorite doctors

oh me...
saddest corruption in S2E1?
When's the show start?
and everyone hates twist *eyeroll*
dunno
should be in about 10 minutes
Twist is pretty cute
but i certainly know pinkie got the creepiest
Until she opens her mouth
nopony likes a lisp
Ahhh.
personally i think Rainbow
No lisps are fine
ok when it starts I may just be on and off, and i don't know how long I can stay
I think Lisp is a beautiful programming language.
when is the show starting?
Twist = meh.
Reignbao dash
It's her voice itself that makes me want to punch babies
1 hour
since she had to choose between her friends and old home
lawl, the show is starting in 1 hour
Flutterb****
and the whole...laughing balloons
I dunno
I don't really bother much with background ponies
creepiest not saddest
06,15RALTS, FUCK YEAH!
Fanon ftw.
i talk about saddest
show is starting in 1 hour
ruts rat?
ok
Pinkie's corruption freaked me out
you rant one ron ton soop?
it was her begging him to stop that got me
kk
EPIC
beep beep
it was the balloons for me
weee
derivery
Is twist really a bg pony?
friggin' creepy
equestria girls!
inb4
Damnit.
Equestria Girls!
inb4induring
inafterinb4induring
That mention.
well twist is more of a one time character I guess
E-questria-girls
Anything > Katy Perry.
maybe she'll appear again in S2 though
There needs to be a speed metal version of Equestria Girls
she already did didn't she?
I think they're still wondering how to tap us as a market
but once they do... all my monies
Oh, that's easy
I'm trying to do a mashup of this song and Megadeth's Looking Down the Cross
along with snips and snails
?
^ and that
ya, they're streaming again
I think it's the Hub realizing that 20-30 year old guys have more disposable income than 5 year old girls.
plushies of DERPY
Heh.
Shrek 2.
oh wow
<3
Aw Shrek..
My favorite one time pony is Nurse Redheart. Because Nurse.
I'm leaving
Is she a "Helloooooo Nurse" type?
I have to think of Schimanski every time i hear this song.
We need a sad song right about now.
OOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Nurse redheart has a good design I think
i need a heroooo
Cool

Wait we AREN'T a cult?
07,1Bronydom is a religion
oh heh, bitcomment, that explanes it.
an awesom cult
Whoops
we sure seem to twitter/obsessively follow anyone even SLIGHTLY related to the series
were more of a fandom than a cult.
/me rushes to hide the sacrificial daggers
Remember, in times of doubt: WWRDD.

04BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRB
07,1Zimmer music = always epic
hello
yep
Hans Zimmer is everywhere
agreed
04BATCEPTION
Zimmer == boss
Strange man RUUUUUNNNN
Ok, ba- wait... Weren't the 2 epsidoes supposed to play first?
this calls for the inception button!
laugh softly to self.
07,1first time for me watching this too
I ahven't seen this one :3
07,1but that might be me
/me has watched that movie before. Twice.
Inception was great
this movie also greatly suffers from the "too long" syndrom
well it is hans zimmer @luna
05can you do that? watch a movie? TWICE!?
xD
Inception DID spawn a few too many memes though.
great 15 whole minutes were missed.
I prefer Memento myself
Grundle: DONT YOU DARE
Zimmer is the man, but personally I prefer Giacchino's music.
inb4 asskicking
even though its not a bad movie
his parents are DEAAAD
I seek another cuppa tea.
TEIM FOR PLUTO TRIVIA
Dunno.
i dont hate these movies
i dont hate any movies
suddenly asskicking
Pretty sure it is. Nolan likes to do that
and i dont dislike inception
Nolan has this nasty tendency to reuse actors...
he's speaking Japanese
Power kick.
I hate some movies
it's getting real in here
Like, uh
Panic room
Hello
"hate" is a strong word
Get pwned by Qui Gon
pwn'd...
HAHAHAHAH XD
hi D_E
Y U NO APPEAR YET
Hey.
He's afraid of Dr-dr-dr...
OO
Transformers 1 was OK, the rest were terrible
DRAGONS
in order to "hate" a movie, it should be more than just bad
i needs to do something terribly wrong
omg why is there a support board if there is nooen there to help
Well, Transformers 2 was more than just bad
it all starts with one misjudgement by the supervillian.
I AM HERE.
and alfred never aged
yo
then it unwraps.
i think dragons taste pretty good :3
Twilight deserves hate
he's in like everything ever
Twilight the movies
and even if you hate a movie, its often because of something personal
I cannot remember his name
witch one
The falling and picking up one.
No thanks
hullo
pffft
sure
burton
Weee! train.
Oh look exposision
right now, theres only one director that i can say that i "hate"
Long time no see.
movie is not working
i like trains
and that would be uwe boll
"better?"
I like trains!
because he just abuses movies
lol exposition
I can't think of his name
Klansmen are still relevant?
I wish gotham existed.
Not gonna lie: wish I could live in Gotham
I hope the stream isn't as laggy as last time
trololololo
brb
it's called chicago
Before Gotham became Chicago.
nothing bad could possibly happen
Burton is doing a modern remake of "Dark Shadows"
This is typical children's entertainment, no? :P
this kid's such a wuss
they were reading lovecraft
nice parenting
>get attacked by a couple bats
and said "we should put a shoggoth in"
>PTSD
Oh.
Let's go to the scary alley!
child afraid of bats,bring him to bat opera
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY.

Poor kid
Darned crack addicts
"Thanks dad"

i guess this is supposed to be an emotional moment
lawl.
Mildly.

>is not crying.
i can tell because sad music is playing
6What page are you on?
why would the insanely rich family go to such a crappy theater?
and thus, he learned that with great wealth comes great responsibility
THEN BRUCE BECAME CUBONE
Sitting in a chatroom during such moments never works though. :P
wait.
you are awesome!
Gordon!
I think it's time for MOAR PLUTO TRIVIA
lag*
Ugh, I hate the backspace thing.
gordon is the best part of this movie, srsly
6Like, give me the whole url
crap theater?it's gotham,i guess that one is the best they have
I'd be a puddle of tears and pee
lol
O.o
He wasn't in Blade Runner.
Was he really in Blade Runner?
i know it happens to me all the time
Good noose?
05emmet
TLDR....
05stop it.
at least he still has his dignity.
good nose
and money :3
cool textwall
Oh, I forgot about Blade Runner, he wasn't in that...
he was in My Little Pony?
6...I like colors. =D
probably
We'll be watching the empire!
The origins of the emperor
He voiced the SMOOOZE
=O hax!
A movies I meant...
that's why he hates the republic
Seems familiar.
Rutger Hauer was in Bladerunner
lol XD
cheer up, emo Bruce
Glory to the empire
07,1teeth is scary...
very well
07,1it gave me nightmares..
Oh ok.
Teeth was hilarious.
Alfred!
there is the tears.
k helps to be on the right page
05teeth is jsut, unpleasant. nothig more nothing less
6Teeth...
but no pee
6*shudder*
Well I'm probably far away from the server
disgusting
and nothing mroe
That movie…*shivers*
Alfred is best pony
I've heard of Teeth, and having heard of it, i don't want to see it.
6Teeth is none of the above
6Ever.
lol Dari
he probably peed when his parents died
teeth is ridiculous to me. I mean, HOW MANY TIMES CAN A PERSON BE RAPED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
whew helps to be on the rght page!
GTFO.
:P
Caine is godly.
Lawl, not Teeth.
NINJAS
.......GODDAMNIT BJORNFOT,SAY IT ALREADY!
*You're the best, around! Nothing's ever going to bring you down!"
those are some crappy ninjas.
Dat BDSM-club
Ninjas make a good movie

dat chekov's line
Shutup
Awfully quiet in Applejack.
3 Is the stream already up?
if I win b-movie, we're watching Baby Geniuses 2

Seriously, let's have next week's movie be Avatar. Just... get that out of the way right now.
06,15Yes, Denied_Existence_
yes D_E
srsly?
Avatar on a stream
Avatar? As a B-movie?
Why would you do that
Avatar would be a good B-movie
I still want to see labrinth as one of the movies
swordpunching!
Neeson makes everything cooler.
I say we have "The last Airbender" as next week's A movie
Neeson made Taken worth watching
he's teaching him how to be a jedi
Taken was a weird movie though
it was like a fps
in movie form
/me gives Denied_Existence_ a beter interwebs connection
well I mean
Which could be interesting for cat
most movies I wouldn't mind seeing twice
I say we have "The Elite Squad" as an A movie
http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/fcc28e54db9be15fc80576952aa26396/36568%20-%20Batman%20Trixie%20artist%3Aunstable-psyche%20crossover.png
but Taken
owned

In the mountains
The reason he fails is because midichlorians remind him of bats.
midichlorians are a lie
Shoot em Up is a awesome movie
no spoilers
them carrots
the force is not an infection
..the day after tomorrow, for the movie?
wait... wasn't that just four messages?
also, we need to watch SHoot 'Em Up
it's 10 seconds
not in a row
I mean, jedi.
I approve of Shoot 'Em Up
I was indifferent to shoot 'em up.
Albert was an old geezer even 30 years ago.
;_;
lol maybe
fluttershy would be an awesome ninja"I'm going to kill you...if it's okay"
this scene is awesome
Alfred never ages.
Police Story, anyone?
she's quiet enough.
oh
Alfred is the master of the criminal world of gotham
Fluttershy would be the cutest jedi/ninja
Didn't someone combine Darth Vader with ponies?
did mibbit change?
Toy Story!
Alien
Hot Fuzz, gentlemen?
toy story!
FriendshipCannon absolutely!
rickrolling
probaly
Some people just want to care about the future.

Dat woman that married the Scientology dwarf
no ponyception for me tonight...

Pinocchio and the Empire of the Night was ok, It's no crowd pleaser.
Uhhhh
Which version of "Babes in Toyland?"
Tekken?
05tekken doesnt count
05becasue its awesome
Babes in Toyland? Is that like Babe the pig?
just nod and agree with the bots, for fear of them taking over the server one day
06,15It was very much like the old TV-show, really goofy and awesome
>ponyception

I was thinking the same thing.
ya hona.
Mortal Kombat
<3
05inb4 someone mentions doom 3
05then the toruting would begin
04Doom 3 is great
these simple scenes are the best moments in the movie
incoming epic speech
I need to see that episode of BatB

The end.
I don't even know what's happening
05and then, android women
And then Bruce travelled to dream valley to find the flutterponies
Sometimes lies are delicious

04Nah, not at all
some of the worst ever
no we have to go deeper
^
Some of it
good thing this is not trying to be an action movie to 100%
...You're making that up.
fiverhippo we already watched it though.
Conservation of Ninjitsu, dammit
he's gone
REALLY shouldn't have saved him.
nice scream from the asian XD
conservation of ninjutsu...right,i guess
this is only my second movie night
in the massive fireball
Weeee!
In hindsight... this might not be such a good idea
Not necessarily? :<
You killed all the ninjas D:
riiiiight, they survived that....
you know Nolan movies have a pretty distinct style in how they are shot.
Don't just kill one person, kill all the persons
Slippeh slide
Twilight/Applejack moment
of course
Owie.
KNIVES DON'T WORK THAT WAY.
Let go.
in fact, it might be even harder to create an amazing action scene than it is to write a great character
That's why you have screenwriters
Bruce: Just let go…trust me.
And then Bruce became the Element of Honesty
it's the smoke powder
The end
Good to see you.
a great character is something you can think through
That's quite some gunpowder.
guess things can explode twice...
dat arm strength
That explains a great deal. :P
but action needs to come all from talent
...I want to know now too.
dojos can explode twice
nolan movies don't have random explosions, they always have a reason
and intuition for good cinematography
what's the plan
yes you coming up with a plan dose sound crazy
Oh man…my back is hurting right now...:(
and its not something you can really "learn"
suddenly: plane
not sure why that blew up
seems legit
my favorite Nolan movie is Momento
Part from the mad
plane from inception?
nice plan
I'm pretty sure that happypony is just making that up.
i swear it's the same plane
anyone, latest episode today or tomorow?
elephants.
hmmmm
tomorrow at 9am est
i agree
screw the city, aquire money.
mib_leeoo4: tomorrow is s2e2
k, back... DAMMIT
04Oh yeah, faster than the speed of light right dari?
cheers!
g2g. sorry
Wait, what's the name of this movie?
04Read about that earlier
Go tachyons.
I picked a stupid time to cute my pizza
U MAD Einstein?
In europe and east of it : Today
wait, dari found a way to completely hide /nick changes in #bronystate now ? o_0
Alfred is best butler.
Ninja'd!
05ah selfish old butler eh?
thanks master bruce...really...
hi everyone; 12 hours until twilight kicks discord's butt? ;)
Only in the embedded client?
Dirty clothes, dirty face, still, styled hairs.
Alfred, LIKE A BAWS
cool
04OH SHIT
HIM
What's the full title of this film again?
Zasz cameo!
04Except
04wait
*him
OMGOMG
to the moooooon he goes
that makes more sense >_<
What's the movie lineup for tonight?
to EqD
O hai, Cillian
13
Caaaarrrlll
2% might be enough.
04Indeed
however, the problem in this movie is that it also tries to be realistic, and it just doesnt work
batman,still in early concept as hoboman
comes off as weird to me
Pluto's mass is 1.31×1022 kg, less than 0.24 percent that of the Earth, while its diameter is 2,306 (+/- 20) km, or roughly 66% that of the Moon
BAT
Bat!
a bat!
yeah that's right sorry lol
TO THE MOOOOOON
Guys
04Why not?
Otherwise my physics course is just fucking blown out the window.
04Oh
04Well
If that bat hadn't showed up
Bats fly WAY more rapidly in a house
Then I get to hear my teacher say
We'd have Hoboman
>all we've learnt
>it's wrong
XD
yep
We'd have the motherfucking HOBOMAN
Everything you know is wrong~
don't they say that all the time anyway
I'm not paying attention, what's the debate that's going on?
SCIENC
enjoy physic course
we have lost a great thing thanks to that bat
the concept of hoboman is actually rather interesting
Giggle at the bats bruce.
lol
6...I am Hoboman
they should make a movie out of that
D'awwww
we'll never discard einstein's theory, but we may modify it
D'awww
Special relativity is extremely accurate. I wouldn't throw it away. Gallileian relativity hasn't quite been thrown away yet.
If the writing on ep 2 is as awesome as ep 1 *sqee*
I'm aware of this invention
All laws have rebels right?
It was adorable.
goriest film I've ever seen.
6Anyone seen a hobo with a broadsword?
I didnt have the heart to kick out the snoozing bat.
I haven't
This event inspires him to become: Owlman!
I used to live under a colony of bats
Hence, no need for more.
Hobo with a military grade mine clearer
has the LHC done ANYTHING useful yet
LHC is finished.
/me shrugs
you probably though those bats were real
DAT LEIFMOTIF
I haven't heard about it since all the 'end of the world' nonsense
It's just not been tested at full power yet.
He's changes every 10 weeks
04So, I'm not too concerned
Ratman is due in April
lol
6...what if when he was a kid...
anybody read the webcomic Ratfist?
6he was scared by Sea Ponies?
there's an app for that
Even one that the universe itself is stopping the experiment from working.
;o
05seaponyman!
Seaponyman for the win.
It does.
HE'S GOT NO SUPERPOWERS! HE'S Just a Flyin' RAAAAT!
Shoo be doo
Seaponarang!
SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE DOO
:D
there's a pony for that
It's a good thing we've got Arkham cuz he really drives us bats!
yup yup yup
04Damn, I can't wait till next month
I am, but don't tell anyone.
04Arkham City is gonna be freaking awesome
that's such a stupid media-driven line of bull
sorry to disappoint xD
dat quip
I'm back
happypony: both dont exist, whats the difference? :D
Arkham City looks amazing
;)
ba dum tish
a job at my own company...maybe i'm asking too much
I'm waiting to get it on the Wii U though :P
FOX!
he's the boss
>Wii U
just wait. after the release we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
OMG
same here :3
:D
YES!
I don't just do planets,I do moons,stars,planets,dwarf planets,binary planetary system,solar systems,galaxies,black holes,white holes,wormholes,space itself.All sortd of things
It's him!
I didn't know he was in this movie.
the batbin,more or less
Fox
*worships gordan feeman*
lol
04But the idea of a fully functioning sandbox open world instead of a linear setting is going to be fucking righteous
Sandboxen are over-rated
probably my favorite part of the movie
05ghosties
07,1guilty!
I can't wait to see Luna tomorrow
/me sagely nods
04Wrek?
should
Malfoy has a pimp cane, though...
05included
Seems legit
spelunking.
Spelunking.
*not sure if serious*
Spelunking /is/ rather dangerous.
Taliban caves
04varyingdegreesofwant
RX J0806.3+1527
just wait. after the release of Arkham City we have Twilight Quinn videos everywhere
wait did he...
04I'm getting it for the 360
The Descent
04So
Spelunking is dangerous - you might encounter skeletons, zombies or even creepers! :P
04Doesn't bother me all that much
HOW CONVENIENT
also Fanart
charming xD
"Charming"
/me approves of dari's commment.
or endermen or silverfish
The Bat Cave!
The bat cave :D
oh dear god-not the creepers!
suddenly
music
YAH DAT LOOKS SAFE
that's a nice batcave you got there
dat zimmer drumbeat
and sarcasm
it'd be a shame if anything happened to it.
omg
Damn you
04Whoa
That detracts
It also has Luna in it
04We just went RE5 for a moment
What's the name of the actor that plays the butler?
Micheal caine
it's just a ball of ice
Malfoy also wears a dress.
makes sense
Jervill: it is.
In 1955 Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of the Earth, with further calculations in 1971 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars.
Needs to be blacker
I mean, isn't that just a BIT superfluous?
:I
to hide the batnipples
04WE NEED TO GET DARKER
...and I'm back
ME GUSTA
Emmett...
Ghehe.
I don't think the pimp cane works well with a dress.
We need to go BLACKER!
This music really helps the movie
10k pieces
at least we'll have spares....
Rarity proved dresses are manly though.
Hmmm
*Judge
10,000 tetrahedrons?
I like how they do it subtly
Oh hi Gordon
by ordering 10k
aaaah, Flass
Not sure how often the subject of conversation turns to pluto
Hanz Zimmer seriouses the fuck out of everything he's in
Gordon aged pretty well, lol
Correction 20% cooler
Trending?
like Twitter?
/me looks at EQD
2,14 Babes in Toyland
needs more trending up it EQD!
Yeah, it's Twitter
That's not how units work. :p
04Oh, hey
Gordon is best pony
trend ALL the tweets!
I suppose I could slow down with the trivia...
Hans Zimmer is making the music for Mass Effect 3 as well
04LEVERAGE
04OH SHIT
04IT'S ON NOW
No he isn't.
that one song
Okay thanks
He's not?

Dat stapler
OH SHIT

I MISSED LEVERAGE?!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

How do I shot web?
Poor Bruce still hasn't upgraded from Hoboman.
that nolan cut
Actually, which version?
6Dashite, you should learn
Oh yeah, I went there.
But with gunfights
I'm on a batmobile.
I guess you're right, Clint Mansell is apparently doing ME 3
"Sharp line delivery." *Instant cut to quiet next scene*
>mfw I still dont get the leverage thing
nb4 dumb fabris
We should watch Leverage on this channel
Jack Wall and that team was fantastic for ME2
2,14 I have no idea...lol
not sure why they got rid of him
Wow, I want that now :P
"Smart Fabric!"
>He finances his own films through his Boll KG production company. He is often cited as one of the worst directors of all time.
haha alright
Wing-Boner!
give me the cape and the tazer glove.
I don't always go spelunking but when I do, I use military grade equipment
clint Mansell is all old-school orchestra, there's no electronic background
\"|/
FriendshipCannon: Quite literally.
And that... my friends... is how a wing-boner happens.
and that tank
\:|/
OMG
oh yeah!
ITS A TRANSFORMER
His style was pretty unique
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~
ME3 is going to lose that electronic flavor it had
in the first ME at least
Want
04I'm hungry

Fact: This is a movie.

*batman hugs Luna*
