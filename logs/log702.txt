Gentelmen-geeky: wut, she went berserk several times
Chrysalis: ur mom is relative

shes related to me
Ponies47: but this isnt a best pony argument
twilight_sprinkle: ur mom is a best pony argument
Phase4 iron furnace on bottom

Ponies47: no i stared
Chrysalis, ?
Gentelmen-geeky: she went berserk during the gala ep too though
taoumi, XD
twilight_sprinkle: the anemuls wer mean to her
ignore me, i got the recipes for generator and iron furcnace mixed up
Gentelmen-geeky: not really, they were just trying to be left alone
Chrysalis, ah
where did my copper cables go
must have used them all
Phase4 use tin for your solar cables
twilight_sprinkle: i forfit your relaity and supste my own
and use the fibre for your machines
I love this song <3
more effecient overall
Ponies47: me two
Gentelmen-geeky: not sure if forfeit is proper word for this :P
BEATLES!?
Flyboy: nope
twilight_sprinkle: i think i just ran out of fuqs
Flyboy: no. black sabbath
-.-
Can't wait for RP to hit 1.2.3
Gentelmen-geeky: naw, i stole them
sarcasm it the lowest form of wit
Flyboy: Buck yeah
will be nice to build with marble again
cachi01|LBPVita: what rong with black sabbth
twilight_sprinkle: i knew it
who is streaming?
Flyboy: Phase4
Flyboy Phase4
Gentelmen-geeky: cashieoh-wun was just joking that this isnt beatles
Gentelmen-geeky: i was being sarcastic. Flyboy said BEATLES!? and i said no. black sabbath
Phase4: you playing tekkit? or technic?
Flyboy a) is single player
balls
cachi01|LBPVita: oh i thot you wer saying sumthing els
b) no one should ever use either of those packs
twilight_sprinkle: ok
Chrysalis: this is a multiplayer server actually
support the mod devs
y u say oh wan its zero!!! not oh!
Chrysalis: and iirc phase said this is full tekkit
hay Ponies47 gess wut
Flyboy, tekkit
yes?
i got a top hat
Cool
ikr
Phase4: do you have hamachi, becuase i could put up a server if you want
just because its tekkit doesnt mean its SMP
ahh solar panels, so OP late game
though not nearly as OP as GeoThermals
all due respect Chrysalis, but geothermal aint that good unless your in the nether.
Flyboy, this is actually running multiplayer
ur mom is not nearly as OP AS GeoThermals
well thats my opinion anyway
Flyboy actually they are incredibly powerful
might do geothermal
Phase4 dont do it like that
use a energy condenser
Phase4: it is? can i join you, or do you want to go solo?
and you can make lava cans
Flyboy, solo for now
only need to get one can
then we a mk 3 and a energy relay
infinit power from 5/6 geothermals
Phase4: kk, tell me when you allow people to join? :)
hmm
need more solar cells
Chrysalis
meanwhile, ima go on deus ex
well i think i shall be off to bed...night yall and thanks for the stream Phase4 ^_^
solar cells are a pain
Is there a stream?
night NocturnalBlade
Night NocturnalBlade :)
pm me i d like to ask ya something
cya NocturnalBlade :)
Night NocturnalBlade :)
Spell-of-Gaming: Yep
moo
Phase4 i would recommend using either the BC automated crafting table, or the RP2 Project table
makes manufacture MUCH easier
the latter is better
Phase4: now thats a song to go to sleep to :D
Phase4: us that just industrialcraft or do you have other mods too?
NocturnalBlade: IKR? :p
XD
Dark_Horst, tekkit
this sounds like woodentoaster or TLT, am i rught
right*
I was the bastard who requested it :P
Flyboy: TLT
thought so
wow
thats expencive
Flyboy: TLT and Bronyfied
ok then
with micthemic?
Phase4 the handsaw is good for many uses
Flyboy: bronyfied.
kewl
but yeah the automated crafting table can pull out of adjacent chests to craft
u may know him for his awesome metal covers
Seriously...
and the project table has an internal inventory
This songs TOO british for me
And that's rare
Tombstone is singing and bronyfied made the music
I can't stop listening to this song
i could make a geothermal
Phase4 which IC2 is this?
Phase4 dont use lava pumps when you have EE its a false economy
youll waste so much fuel
Phase4 I heared you may put up a tekkit server.
i may or may not give you guys the address
not yet though
And that my friends is the song I blast into my ears every single day at school :P
Phase4 You can message me ;)
warning: the following song is fucking beautiful
^
Gypsy Bard!
all that happens when you give away the address
oh boi dis song
is everyone joins, steals all your stuff to gear themselves
and never plays again
Chrysalis, also theres an oil well
i just love the contrast of the lyrics to the tune
Phase4 my school baned headphones for being "anti social" and they're bein bucking strick on it.'
/me <3 this song for some reason
well then
TheRainbowDawn, o_O
banned headphones?
Phase4: It's just awesome ;3;
:O gypsy bard <3
Phase4 how come your actually on the 1.2.5 version? i see no mod which isnt at 1.3
Chrysalis the technic launcher creator needs to update t.
nooooo Phase4 don't rely on oil and fuel. it jsut explodes if you don't pay atention to it
Chrysalis, tekkit
taoumi, i know, but its an option
besides, i want an oil well
tekkit is bad
TheRandomkid321: Banned headphones? That sucks :<
00,10this looks like build craft
poo o nyou Chrysalis i think it's fun
doesnt actually ask for permission from the mod authors
hence why no forestry
not it's ful ltekkit Sumica it has ee and redpower
well, i love this song already
i wub this song
lol
they started to code in things to that it would deliberately break
Ponies47: im a pony
so whats this song called?
Gentelmen-geeky: Cool
do you still know what its like down there?
Ponies47: lol so how are you
Flyboy: scootaloos wings by pinkie guy
kk thanks
Gentelmen-geeky: Ok. you?
A.K.A needsmoredjent
Ponies47: im good
00,10well what ever they call it
00,10the one with pipes and power
lol
Sumica red power or bc2
both are completely seperate power/transport system
00,10oh he's got the alcimist stone too
this song is...quite beautiful...
wel lyou are right Sumica build craft does have pipes and pumps and what not but what he is playing is not soley build craft
00,10well yeah but key peices are there.
Philosophers stone
from EE2
00,10cant ecactly ID all the mods at a glance now can I.
everythings soo damned cheap
hes already said its tekkit
Phase4 use red-power then for transport
thats more expensive and more powerful anyway
?
i was going to stick redstone engines there
Phase4 Tubing rather than pipes
00,10he also dont have his viewfinder centered on his game
hmmm build craft rail caft red power balkens wepon mod. equevelent exchange
Chrysalis, ?
am i missing some?
you were complaining it was too cheap
:3 sorry i'll stop beign a butt
i was pointing out there is an alternative
which works better
ther need to be a metal ver
Chrysalis, XD
00,10yeah taoumi, you forgot he had minelittle pony at some point but he forgot to update it
/me Looks at clock
/me Facehoofs hard
Go TO bread Ponies47 :3
ut dosen't work with tekkit :( i have that one too. but tekkit is 1.2.5
Yes time for bread. It's passed 3:30 AM

night Ponies47
forestry was removed
you sure?
/me Huggles everypony <3
because they got in argument
whatcha doin now Phase4
they never asked forestry to be included
pbpbbbpbpbpbb
He hasn't made a server yet has he? Just making sure. I was AFK for a bit.
then bitched because forestry rigged it so it would break if forestry was included
night everypony. mom is mad god knows why :p cya
so even if you do have forestry
:D
he is on a server. :3 but he don't wana share and have us hose it up
its a VERY old version
nighr cachi01|LBPVita
and cachi01|LBPVita was never seen again
there was one here
i know there was one
i have no idea lol
YUS

Bye cachi01|LBPVita :)
he's looking for oil not lava
here it is
never did like ocean oil poils
pools*
such a pain to filter out the water without wasting oil
i thought they were al lthe rage with large companies Chrysalis :3
:P
00,10yeah it sucks when you get saltwater in your oil lines
theres 2 source wasted at leats
least*
now, does he do the redstone engine or use more power
doesnt mark it on his minimap :S
00,10btw Phase4, your game is not all the way on stream
I got salt water in my oil once. My robot got so rusty. I had to rebuild him. IT'S NOT EASY TO GET A HUMAN BRAIN!
you say yes i say no you say stop i say go go go
00,10cant see map and item bar

Phase4: not to be annoying or anything (i guess its out of boredom) but you gonna give out the ip soon?
Flyboy unlikely
Gentelmen-geeky: nice, whats the thing in the top?

skype screenshare
Oh okay.
isn't that cheating
yes
No >_>
ok
i need about 500 pipe
<3
Flyyy me to the moooon!
or you could cheat Phase4 and use teleport pipes
and a world anchor
taoumi, i'm going to cheat in world anchors
oh shit creeper
alexxm, i've got the explosions made safe
Phase4 do you not have ender chests?
they hurt but they dont damage blocks
Chrysalis, i do not
ah ok
dosen't work directly Chrysalis sadly
is thsi bayonetta ost?
i should make some ender chests
taoumi, dimensional anchor in the neather?
11,02DID YOU KNOW?: Nintendo rejected a number of Pokemon ideas when Red and Blue were being developed. Shortly after launch, Nintendo allowed other companies the rights to using some of those rejected ideas. One of those companies was Warner Bros. which they then in turn created the Animaniacs.
bayonetta has some very awesome epic songs~
Phase4 works on servers
it will keep the nether loaded
even if no one is ther
i'm on a server
dont have any blaze rods though
and not keen on going after them
Phase4: what? no world anchors keep a chunk loaded
NewSuperBronyU wow pokemon was being devloped for a long time
urgh
NewSuperBronyU: lawl so animaniacs is pokemon
thats gona be expencive
but less expencive than the alternative
wow NewSuperBronyU
rly animanics are close to pokemon :D
I'm off to watch doctor who. Have to go because the IRC app refuses to run in the background on my iPod.
it's not like you don't have the daimonds for it Phase4
bye XAX
cya XAX :)
bye XAX
well anyway, im out, thenks for streaming, Phase4
taoumi, true
bye XAX
later twilight_sprinkle
11,02I'm only kidding though, Animaniacs isn't a rejected Pokemon idea :<
NewSuperBronyU: :|
bye twilight_sprinkle
:D
NewSuperBronyU: u r bad liarponi
Night twilight_sprinkle :3
taoumi, it will cost me most of my diamonds though
/me banishes NewSuperBronyU to the 5th dimision
for 2 telport pipes Phase4 ?
k, cyall~
Phase4 if you are going to do a chunk thing in the nether with ender chests
http://theadmin.co.uk/NewImages/6Kvuv0.jpg
do something like that
no, NewSuperBronyU is just a silly pony :3
taoumi, yeah?
well the thing w/ the ender chests is it's a very convaluted machine
taoumi, 8 diamonds for 8 pipes
11,02twilight_sprinkle: :<
11,02thelonepony: :>
11,02alexxm: :<
it's goign to be ALOT easyer to d othe teleport pipes the nto pipe though a ender chest Phase4
taoumi how are they convoluted?
they are literally colour coded
taoumi, both are expencive either awy
way'
/me feeds NewSuperBronyU whiskey
what i really want is a quarry
2 delpoers 2 ender chests and a loop going fro meach
/me noms on the whiskey
11,02O.O
Phase4 i recommend you spend what diamonds you have on energy collecters
and 2 pumps
11,02@__@
for a quarry u need aprox 11 diamonds
so at least your earning resources while deciding
nooooo Phase4 don't doo et
at least
use SCIENCE
inb4 red SB
and now NewSuperBronyU|Drunk is Krunk :P
/me stumbles over Phase4
<3 u NewSuperBronyU|Drunk
NewSuperBronyU|Drunk, o_O
11,02Maid_RainBow: alfn u niop[
it is INCREDIBLY expensive
however, they generate EMC constantly
wow he is drunk :P
btw I reccomend you don't focus too much in EE2
huh... guess NewSuperBronyU|Drunk isnt a red mean drunk...
Chrysalis, yeah but i could do that with a number of other things
he is silly Drunk
01,04o_______o
oh yeah, cobble gens ETC
you know what.. i'm goign ot bed soon and i can't get on that server sooo do whatever you want
Get that SB in bed before he gets moar drunk... 6_9
but you have no quarry etc atm
there is a much more poerfull and more compact way to get free energy Chrysalis
/me noms on thelonepony
so for now your world is idle if you are
/me takes NewSuperBronyU|Drunk to the bar
NewSuperBronyU|Drunk: YOu are not allowed to be drunk
SB is nomming on me, yay :3
now I want to install the mod pack XD
what? bronystate tekkit server :3
lol
taoumi not much gives more energy than properly set up energy collectors
taoumi, my server
lol u guys have a server?
i know Phase4 i was jokeing
i didn''t know
hmmm
i could
simply use geothermal
its much closer
it dosen't make mater Phase4 but it is nice
it doesn't provide much E, i preffer wind
11,02Vordox: :<
i need more resources
FreNeS1 Water wheels are generally better than wind
if you put the time in
they can be pretty awesome
ya, but u need water,
i am lazy
water isnt really in short supply
:D
LOL
btw if they have a sv, could u pass ip or web?
ㅇㄴㅁ
Sumica well theres your problem
your using a river
a pump in the corner of a 3x3x1
00,10ocean was too far away
will never empty
oh yeah
i can just condense coal
or u can do a flower in EE2
and btreak the game
Phase4 do it with lava cans
thats my power problem solved for now
then you can use geothermals
more EU per EMC
now
00,10then again most the time my factorys explode
what do i need next
i do need a quarry
11 diamonds
16 gold
25+ iron
cobble and wood
+ engines
expensive
/me licks Ordinalthrone
o hai AdamTheDuck
Did chat die? :<
:<
dang
ooh in 1.2.3
chunk loaders work in SSP
chat not die
nice
no, just silent
Morning everybrony.
btw is there a bronystate server?
Hi Malavolent :)
FreNeS1, I think NewSuperBronyU set one up
Hello Malavolent
o and hi Ordinalthrone :)
i dont understand... what is happening on the stream? anyone care to explain?
So many YouTube tabs.
eeeyup. it still works. the blaze rod method of mater creation still works
Ordinalthrone, Minecraft madness
bah, making a nano suit takes awhile....
i know its minecradt but what is with the transmutation?
is it tekkit?
yup
Eeyup. Tekkit.
the server I mean
it's Phase4 's
shim sham
r63 \:3/
it's not that bad
u need 8 more gold and 3 more diamonds
i lost my energy condenser to a creeper :|
uh that hurts
had to remake one
this song. its not bad
damnit now i want cider
lol
um one question, anyone here know how to charge the sonic srewdriver
here we go
00,10http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbusnnsIlv1r8uiq6o1_1280.jpg
got a quarry
bam
XD
now the engines
hold a BT battery in your hand
and right clikc
lol?
Chrysalis: thx :$
is it in short range?
i'ma cheat some lapis in
for the markers?
understandable
everyone did that
i think
Night everypony And thanks for the stream Phase4 :)
i didnt at first
Goodnight thelonepony
but now i do, but i destroy the markers after
night thelonepony
Chrysalis, well i'm ok with cheating as long as my emc doesnt change
you only actually need 3 markers
that lapis cost me
Chrysalis, eh, too late now
3¿
lets you customise the height at least
bye thelonepony
i thought 4?
00,10last one is a given
FreNeS1 nope
you can set a quarry with 3
Phase4 right click the markers
You need more tabs Phase4
would the crow be an a or a b movie
00,10make it bigger
i also do the height
dunno why
Sumica theres alot of debate as to which is better
smaller is quicker to diamond
larger is better for time effeciency
00,10he's magicing up diamonds
Chrysalis well theres only one way to find out fight
i prefer larger
alexxm its personal preference
how many blocks high is it
i want the quarry underground
00,10sits like 5 tall
thanks
diamond level is 11-17
so if you keep it at like y>20
youll basically clear out the diamond level
00,10it will auto clear the space it needs
00,10so long as the 3 points are all at the same hight that is
what the hack kind of button did i just press
:D
XD
Phase4 the one to show loaded chunks
lol
huh, sensor net?
whut?
lolwut?
i like how it shows my hidden anchor
ah so yeah, chunk loader
finally done making nano armor :$, now all i need to do is charge it....
thats next
im good alexxm, you?
still need to find irdium ore though
00,10panic

00,10ewwwwww steam engins
But it's like...15% of it is good, the other 50% is meh, and 35% I do not like
Steam engines? Don't those overheat?
Hey guys my internet thing is acting weird here

Phase4: Which song is this if you could link?
00,10also is this the pipes where you need the wrench to make sure it attaches to stuff?
O.O

Vordox, Ping
Thanks Phasey wasey =3
Because I know that the generators using fuel or oil require cooling, but I'm not sure if steam engines also do.
Inst added to favourites!
<3
i'm not sure what tungsten ore is
Phase4: Oh, Tungsten, the Swedish one
:D
In english it's directly translated as "HeavyRock"
oh, tungsten is useless
but its worth two diamond
Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, at 3410 degrees C.
Kammerjunk: Eeyup
Phase4: is tekkit the whole mod bundle?
yeah, cant smelt
Dark_Horst, yes
thx
00,10and then phase had to move out of his house because it became a factory
That usually happens.
Suddenly, Tiny Tim.
XD
00,10next he will want to sort what goes where
ohfuckno Weeping Angel episode next .-.
00,10and set up a lava dump for the unwanted things
Minecraft is an OCD heaven. Tekkit, even more so.
XD
00,10oh wait he has alchimist
what the hell is he doing there O.o?
XAX: Don't even blink.
XAX: As in, watch the entire episode without blinking.
Kammerjunk: o_o
Kammerjunk, o.o
steam engines gona explode isnt it
Probably, yeah.
windows handles my touchpad terribly
Use mouse?

morning everyone
so
Mornin'.
Good morning ShyBetaFemale :3
i want to organize a pajama party with a large group of friends
what are some awesome activities to do in pajamas that don't require getting naked
Tie them to chairs and put on FiM.
ShyBetaFemale: MLP episodes
XD
no thanks Vordox
You people are cruel XD
ShyBetaFemale: Why not?
because no one here likes mlp and i don't want to watch it
Exactly
Ponies are gaaaaaaaaay
What's your age, ShyBetaFemale ?
And your friends age?
20
20s
Oh College yearsy
BEER
ALE
Tie them to chairs and put on Twilight.
yes i was thinking we can do alcohol
that would be pretty fun
ShyBetaFemale: Wait, which country?
dat rainbow factory
germany, drinking age is 18
I'm all out. My social knowledge is pretty much limited to "tie them to chairs".
ShyBetaFemale: Get hambugers
:P
lol dude your ideas are terrible :P
00,10oh dear, he's upgradeing
I am not a social person.
Sumica: Fits the musi
music*
00,10he's going down the path
i used to not be a social person
ShyBetaFemale: No I'mnot, you're asking ina Pony related forum :P
then i became one
00,10now he will need fuel and coolent
what is this music?
but this place is huge surely there must be plenty of new ideas that would be fun to try
Ordinalthrone, WoodenOverture.
00,10it's called rainbow factory
I don't even know what people do at pajama parties. If I'm with a bunch of friends all night, we play games and inject caffeine.
many thanks
ShyBetaFemale: Snacks/Drinks/Probably some Alcholoe, silly games/Drink games.
What's your common activity?
at parties?
ShyBetaFemale: No, for your whole friend group
What's connecting them?
00,10and once phase gets oil, he will realise refiled oil is better
drugs alcohol and being awesome
Aaand I dont want to give advice
<-- No Drugs EVER
^
^^
no i don't do drugs at parties
Alcohol, on the other hand...
00,10then he will need storage tanks and pumps and it's a never ending cycle.
But yeah, find a common activity
Or liking
when things are loud i stick with alcohol i'm just wondering if there is more i could be doing
00,10end up liveing in a mud hut at the base of a huge indistrial processor
i'm pretty sure everyone would be fine sitting around playing drinking games though
No drugs except ponies?
Would get boring quickly unless you do Alcohole game
ah yeah feel another rainboom coming on
I'm on a drug called Pinkie Pie
ShyBetaFemale: So yeah.. Common link?
What do EVEYRONElike=
?
alcohol dude ofc
Sounds like Beyond Her Garden
ShyBetaFemale: Aand...?
i mean everyone is pretty chill so alcohol will be fine
Something that GIVES intelligence, not taking it away
but this isn't just for my friends, i'd be holding it at the guesthouse which has about 200 people in it
ShyBetaFemale: Alright. Beforehand, get a bunch of food colouring and mix them together to make 6 prominent colours of the rainbow. Mix them with water and make ice cubes out of it. Then when it's frozen, pour them into a glass and pour vodka and blue skittles/M&M through a coffee filter.
Boom. Sonic Rainboom in a glass.
i'm not doing pony drinks
ShyBetaFemale: Pony Pony Pony :P
this pajama party has nothing to do with ponies
ShyBetaFemale: But yeah... Make your whole food/Snack sortiment Alcoholed...
i'm not gonna blast any of that techno pony music either :P
yeah i can soak a ton of gummi bears in vodka that'd be pretty sweet
Oh, I know. But it tastes and looks great.
or learn how to make rainbow shots, that looks awesonme and has a decent ammount of alcohol ^^
But alright. I swear, I had a list of normal drinks somewhere. I've forgotten where, though.
diddutz: Dude, he's 20ish
i think i have that same list on how to mix drinks hahaha
diddutz: They wouldn't make it
the only real requirement for the party is to show up in pajamas
i gotta buy some new pajama pants...
<-- Is a Liquor lover, which is around 40-60% Alcohole, PARTY ...zzz
so what, rainbow shots look awesome no matter how old you are
diddutz: I mean drinking 'em:P
Phase4:
My favourite colour is the rainbow.
JRP,
my favorite color is a deep dark red, it's so sexy
ShyBetaFemale: Okay, let's throw out some random stuff and see what sticks
I do like that colour.
It looks great.
ShyBetaFemale: Snacks, Air, Baloons, Shotglass, Flasks, Episodes of something, Games.
Also, you could try with some scotch. Scotch is always good.
Vordox: That's how I science.
Vordox i know that if you take gummy bears and soak them in vodka for a few days, they end up being like really sugary shots
Phase4: thie be u
so that's one thing i could bring in
so whats Phase4 buliding
ShyBetaFemale: I know that. :P
otherwise i'll have people bring their own alcohol because i'm too poor to pay for anyone but myself
alexxm, tekkit
studd
Ugh. Phase4's ping sound is so similar to the sound my headset makes when it's low on battery.
stiff'
ShyBetaFemale: Is your friends from the same school/Line of Education?
stuff;'
ah ok
getting hungry
Kammerjunk, XD
no Vordox
these are all language students
Phase4: help me with my tumblr
from allll over the world :D
Well, learn Latin and show them who's boss.
ShyBetaFemale: Well you fecked yourself in the schematic lineup then. :P
don't know what that means but ok
ShyBetaFemale: "Alittle bit for everyone"
no i don't care about where they come from
No I mean for activity
i'm calling hax
oh
You could the National Language of counting motion drinking game
ShyBetaFemale: Just say "Heus, amicus/amica! Quid agis?" depending on what gender they are.
Was fun but SO damn hard
Show them what language is boss.
i think i should just stick with alcohol and mix up how it's taken
people will do their own things eventually
Kids nowadays with their alcohole
;_;
So little ingenuity
yeah whatever
Vordox: Hey, scotch is a brilliant invention.
Kammerjunk: I mean how "Alcohole is the party" thought
And not "Party for the party"
I party for the sleep deprivation.
Common party thought nowadays. ><
Phase4: get doom 3
alcohol is a social lubricant
and wrek will make a sandvich for you
Sorry, I could type that without laughing. I don't party, lol.
it brings people together and makes the mood way more fun
couldn't*
ShyBetaFemale: More fun?
ShyBetaFemale: Oh you're in for a ROUGH suprise.
Some would even say it doubles the fun.
I still have no idea what Phase is building XD
AdamTheDuck: A quarry. It mines directly down 'til bedrock.
i really would rather have a lot of alcohol then just have people stand around not do anything
doing*
I would rather have no Alcohole and havef un :P
alcohol makes everything fun
Woot is this Phase4 ?
Hypothetically, if I were to attend a normal party, as opposed to a LAN party, I... well, I don't, so I don't want to entertain that line of thought.
besides if you don't want to drink you don't have to
/me rolls around ded chat \:3/
Well it looks like it's working
Chat is dead, long live the chat.
Phase4: Moar music? =3
Phase4: why noy put a pressure plate on the inside so ya dont have to always close your dooor manually

Phase4 Thats the wrong pump

Oh god that ending sequence of the weeping angel episode where they show a bunch of random statues with the doctor's message about not blinking playing.

That could make someone who gets paranoid about things like that go insane.
Yo, check dis out! http://fav.me/d5ikpkg

How annoying... Adobe Illustrator won't stay open for me anymore...
Why not :<
I don't know why. It just won't.
Gold_Demona, solution: duct tape
I open it, and as soon as the splash screen's gone and the program pops up, it closes itself again.
I wanted to vector a sketch I made yesterday, but now I guess I'll have to use Photoshop instead. Bummer. :<

Content for what Jmo?
Besides the Manehattan vector that's been sitting in my harddrive for months? yeah XD
Shame on you Adam.

Even the big ones
Gold_Demona: me too epecilay the big ones
Gold_Demona: i can see why they are hunted they have awsome pelts
I often see photos of the big cats in captivity that remind me of small cats. Like how they're lying down when they're sleeping or how they play with particular toys.
Yeah
Gold_Demona: i told the lions that they where the lazyest cats ive ever seen
Yes, lions are quite lazy. XD
The only time they really move is when they go hunting.
Gold_Demona: they didnt apreciate it very much
lol XD
hey Gold_Demona have you ever seen the lion man?
Evil lava :<
AdamTheDuck: have you seen the lion man
Nope. I don't have a channel that would show it.

Ah
Spider outside the house
Okay. Thanks. :)
Wait is this is steam?
Phase4: go to sleepies

No'

I thought Minecraft wasnt available on steam?
DerpyMuffins you can add nonsteam gaems to the steam library
My guess is he attached it to his Steam account.
DerpyMuffins so people can see when you play it or not
Added a shortcut
Ah, Balloon Party. I love the tracks in this album.
but Phase4 you need sleepies
I still need to get the AfterParty album.
AJIsAwesome and APPLE 2012
APPLE 2012?
kinda like a Ballon Party Remix Album
Ah, okay.
Thanks :)
I really wanna play Minceraft with peoples again, but somehow all the Bronystate MC server got abandoned
or never had a long up-time
problem is people only really wanna play when someones streaming it
I didn't know there was one.
OtakuTom i used to have 2
a creative and a modded survival
I think I have 3 servers Listed as Broynystate servers, one by Satur/Chrysalis, one by SB64 and one by Wrek... oh and tehre was one by unfoundbug
What mod is Phase4 running?
I played on SBs server when no one was on it, built a few things, even had a grand plan for an area, but alas now...
DerpyMuffins, tekkit
:I minecraft to this music...
also hi. is chat ded?
Hai Eli and yep
05'yawn*
05mornign all
Hey Wrek
Heya Wrek
moin Wrek. didcha wake up as late as i did?
Wrek: because it ain't exactly morning anymore
guude wrek and Eli
yo Lil_B... damn... last day of vacation
Eli in Berlin?
Phase4 you need a wrench for the electric furnace
Lil_B: and i have still so much work to do :(
Lil_B: no at home
howere you can still lose it
unless you use an electric wrench in lossless
which uses more power
Eli I know that feeling >.<
Lil_B: i'm so gonna die...
Eli do your work... you must force yourself! (even if I'm too weak to do this myself ...)
Lil_B i am unfoundbug you know :P
Wrek still goes on his very rarely
as does SB
Chrysalis oh... OH... OH!
/me panics
Eli I have 1 week left, no motivation, and I have to make an absolute minimum of 5 Protocvolls and 1 Presentation -.- and I just can't start
/me runs around, screaming: I need to send the letter!
and everyxthing I need is withing the room I'm in right now, and I have nothing else to do!
Eli calm down!
Lil_B: oh i'm not so bad off... i just have to write a 15page raport and send 3 applications... it's not like i have nothing done yet
Lil_B: oh wait... i have nothing don yet
/me panics again
Eli CALM DOWN and Do work
Lil_B: that would be the smart thing to do, wouldn't it?
Do you really need all that cobblestone Phase4?
Eli http://derpy.me/zds8x
/me turns on the XX and calms down
ok now let's work
thats the spirit!
bout time it crashed
now I should at least start working on one of this things es well...
at lerast finish one of this 1 Din A4 report... erm... brb -.-
stupid java
everyone runs around saying 'you cant defference pointers so no null pointers and blah'
insted you have null refferences
and invalid refferences
which is a very similar problem
appearently my Video was so bad that Vordox lost his ability to speak :/ I'm sorry Guy :
11,01Java has pointers?
Nittany_Discord, refferences
hello everypony :D
all vairables who's type extends object holds a refference
no locals except for the built in types (eg: int, bool)
hello Ordinalth
references are pointers without pointer arithmetic and added type safety
i think these crashes are the universe telling me its bed time
my irc client wont let me use my full nickname I usually use...
Ordinalth, Aus brony!
/me hugs Ordinalth
i is going to bed
Aus bronys UNITE!!
austria bronies ftw! :P
I'm usually Ordinalthrone btw, it's just this client shortens it...
it's weird but it runs on a 2nd gen iPod touch so...
I should sleep too... :P
I forgot, I still wanna listen to This Week in Games :)
trying to liven the chat but it feels dead...
goodnight everypony... :)
niught :)
night*
Trying out a new client... Hope this one works better than the previous one.
ded chat is ded this morning it looks like
Yesh
so... how about them cowboys...
/me asks 'Tavi to play her cello at chat's funeral
I don't watch NFL, so I wouldn't know. :P
/me puts diddutz in a casket
O.ô
¿que?
wut?
olololololololo
10th november right?
s3 premiare?
yesh?

yes
if one extrapolates then the second part is on the 17th right?
Phase4 or also on the 10th
indeed
guess what days i have exams
i dout theyll do 2 new shows in a row. specialy sense they only have 13 total
10th and 17th?
Gold_Demona, and the 14th, yeah
thats local time though, with time zones i'll probably get the episodes that night or the next morning
is that college?
but its still risky doing exams with that much sway in my sleeping patterns
naturesfury, university
k
/me is electronic engineer in training
build dat bass canon
/me has assembled several amplifiers and done designs for simple pre-amps and low poer amps
power'
naturesfury, i could actually build a several kw amp and plug a speaker on it, that should make something happen
ha
Phase4 DO IT
well i gess ima go read some fanfics sense nothing happening c yall
Und dann Phase4 was DJ Pon3
bye naturesfury
Phase4: for how long do you go to univerity now?
Chrysalis, i would except > 100W amps start to become really expencive, plus have you ever heard 1KW of sound?
diddutz, this is my first yeah
year'
I'm studying something similar ...
but for 2 weeks only
, now
diddutz, oh neat, electronics or electrical?
It's a mix up between information technology and electrical engineering
Hello Bronystate! :$
ohai MadSurge
hi MadSurge
diddutz, theres a course like that at my uni, don't quite get why those two are joined though
Hiyo MadSurge
Heya MadSurge
Are we waiting on a stream?
i guess so MadSurge by the way how are things
alexxm: pretty good!
Mom made a chocolate mascarpone cake, mmmmmm
Phase4: I think it's because so you can design circuits with microchips you programmed yourself
diddutz, well yeah, but thats electronics, electrical encompases power distribution and most magnetic machinery
you don't get an electronics course these days without programing, the benefits of ofloading work to ic's is immense
Gold_Demona: I spy your OC napping on a cloud!
lol yup
She be nappin'
Coloring it in Photoshop at the moment. I wanted to vector it, but Illustrator won't stay open. :<
ohai ponies

Hiyo Invi
Hai Invi
Hello Everypony
Hey
hai you two
Hai Laurayne
Hey, Where is.. uhm... Friend Who Talks Blazblue With Me...? o.o;; I Forget His Name...
uh... wat?
I get annoyed when people on skype are always invisible. I need to ask when they're on :|
i just write hi and if they don't respond they don't want to talk or are offline
HIYA everypony
hi Bronysith
Invi I typed "Do you have any intent to converse with me at this point in time? Assuming you are indeed presant at this point in time." just now
Ello Bronysith
like a sir TheRandomkid321
I'm invis a lot myself. =/
Invi or like someone who listens in English class.
hmmm.... i like like a sir better ^^
i need to go buy a mouse
a new mouse that is
I Have News On Blazblue :)
Great Neeeewwwssss <3
you died?
A new Blazblue Game Has been Announced :)
what is Blazeblue?
A 2d Fighting Game
But The Next One Is Announced! I Cant Wait <3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=l_0U5KDFd_o&feature=endscreen
They are releasing Blazblue more frequently then Capcom
sort of getting annoying
It Looks Like Relius Clover is Replaceing Carl Clover In This One Though :s
so....the only thing different in this one is.....new characters?
And Adding To The Story
hi bronies :) good afternoon
ElloEllo
To be honest.......
they could put that has Expansion Pack or DLC
2D fighters get repatative. I find that almost each one is identicle besides a few different stages, character, and moves.
TheRandomkid321, that depends on what angle you see that
Well What Would You Prefer? Haveibng New Control Sets that Make no Sence Or Keeping The Ones That Work? -.-
Not to mention the most effective startegy is push every button at an extremely fast pace.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GjVy2pMZiY&feature=relmfu
Well that Doesnt Work in BB
not all 2d fighters are the same but, one brand gets repetitive
Lincoln for President http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
You Could Understand That The Controls in Blazblue make it more interesting Then other Games Do
TheRandomkid321, I dare you to do that in tourneys, to mash buttons
You really won't get far
trust me
Not Far At All
to give an extremely unpopular opinion....don't hurt me...I think both candidates would be decent presidents
In fact Youd Be Lucky To get Past The AI By Button mashing
CrimsonPhoenix|Read of course not. You will be playing with the elite. The mere thought of mashing buttons against such powerful, skilled beings is a rediculous concept.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcMWnNcOxg4
@ish
hey everypony
But otherwise mashing buttons is an effective strategy.
Yello
TheRandomkid321, thus is why, mashing buttons is in no way effective
More or less
hi BroPony|MEDIC
TheRandomkid321, there are many ways to punish button mashing
no stream?
CrimsonPheonix In single player it is.
Button Mashing Is Only A Viable Means Of Winning if your Fighting Someone Who Has NO Idea What They Are Doing
no stream
Laurayne: like me! :D
most mods live in the colonies
TheRandomkid321, Seth would say otherwise
5am or so now
Laurayne That's a long title.
Title? Oh The Chronophantasma?
that's not long at all
dat capilalization of every word
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350816088399.png
Youll Get Over it
lol
too cute
lol Cute Luna
I'd think it'd be more trouble than it's worth to type like that. =/
not if you're used to it
But Anywho. Im Seriously Eyeing Up The New Character Additions In Chronophantasma....
Lord of the rings battle for middle earth 2 rise of the witch king
http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/342/690/b42.png
now THAT'S a long title
DaringDerpy: NOOOOOOOO
It sure is. Holy cow! O_o
:D
LotRBFME2RotWK
Laurayne I am intigued to find a word I do not know the defenition of, what is this Chronophantasma?
Hell If I Know... o.o
Chrono
Phantasma
time
ghost
it's a porte-manteau
Ahh... That Actually makes Sence in the Blazblue Storyline...
Laurayne using a word that you do not know the defenition of is a foolish concept.
Ghost time
Just checked it's not in the dictionary
Laurayne: sry ^^
TheRandomkid321, because it's a Porte Manteau
Go search Brony
TheRandomkid321: Id Appreciate it If You Kept Your Silly Accusations To Yourself. For Your Information (Not That I Care One Way Or Another) It Is The Title Of The Game, Not A Word I Use Lightly.
Brony is a town in Poland
and seriously, not seeing the obvious Chrono and Phantasma being glued together.
so let's buy it and build our fortress there, Spectrum_Rush
TheRandomkid321, you're just attacking with your hate on fighting games
how can you hate fighting games?
I merely stated my opinion.
Bronysith, by seeing that it's all a scam to drain money out of the consummer
CrimsonPheonix|Read that's not what I said or mean't.
meant
Its Not About Hateing Fighting Games though is It. Its About Being An Ignorant Nutball Because Of That Opinion. Right? I Don't Personally Mind One Way or The Other If You Don't Like Them.
DaringDerpy: ya'd have a better chace at building the buying and building the fortress in Equestria, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa
I was not being an "Ignorant Nutball".
Ahh, But That Is My Opinion, Isnt It? ^_^
I don't really like fighting games, but I see how passionate fans are. Stop hating!
Laurayne perhaps but it's a cruel one.
Spectrum_Rush: I would build it right there http://www.brodyaga.ru/pages/photos/Germany/Bastei%20Germany%201139051620.jpg ...but...it's a dwarf thing
they have rock in SA?
And Your Point Is What? I Can Have My Own Opinion, No Matter How Cruel, Just As You Can, Right?
TheRandomkid321, it was cruel from you to persist on your hate about fighting games
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350809098587.jpg
or 2d fighting games to be exact
Yep okay I'm going to find somewhere on the web that is more intellegent than this... perhaps facebook...
Well, Whatever Our Difference Of Opinions May Be, I Don't Want To Clog up This Chat With Further Needless And Silly Philisophical Discussion On Opinions.
or you're going to find somewhere that would follow you and agree to boost your ego more
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xcw3ZyBeZw
CrimsonPhoenix|Read Ego? Please I have one friend.
And I Apologise TheRandomkid321 . I Didnt Mean To Attack You If Thats How It Seemed. Just Stateing my Points.
Laurayne Hopefully some of your common sense can rub off on CrimsonPheonix|Read
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350800146950.jpg pic of the worst villain
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyIiixA0ez0 less weird shit
Bronysith, quit that
CrimsonPhoenix|Read: I Just Dont Like To Cause Useless Conflicts If Theres No Point Or Anything For Me To Gain From It.
Chrysalis=worst villain isn't a fact
it's your opinion
?
/me is best villain
lol
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350795158565.jpg
ok im back, i miss anything?
BroPony|MEDIC: CrimsonPhoenix|Read is pregnant
hmmm, twins?
someone made an impressively beautiful chrysalis pic....
TheRandomkid321: Also, Your Name Is Kind of A Bother To Type Because Its First 5 Letters Are Similar To Someone Else's. So I Have To Type Out More Of The Words. lol
CrimsonPheonix|Read I don't feel good when I have an argument with someone on the intnernet. If you can say tha I wasn't "hating" on 2D fighting games we can let this all be behind us.
DaringDerpy there are many awesome pics of Chrysalis
/me is watching ponies on da Hub
http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1349130280224.jpg

Bronysith: Is That Yoko? Nice

Laurayne: not after the timeskip

Laurayne: I'm more interested in her gun skills tbh :D

Bronysith: You Realise People Were Lusting After Her long Before The Time Skip Right? And Admit It, It Wouldnt Make A Differense To You EWither, Would It
i couldnt find any good pictures of asuka,,, i failed you Shizuka
So much anger in the chat today. Good gracious. o_o
Laurayne: Yoko is still incredibly hot
I Can Agree With That

Bronysith: You're incredibly hot (literally?)

You can't let anybody just enjoy something, can you TheRandomKid321? =/
You're way too RAWR!!!
Bronysith Listen PG13 chat mate. I don't care what your into I'm not one to judge but please I don't want to think of someone fantasising over drawings.
TheRandomkid321: No Need To be Rude. This Is An Open Space To Talk. Its Not Pony Restricted.
TheRandomkid321: *you're
celestia and luna are also hot
Chrysalis: still looking for it
Though I Do Agree With Keeping It Clean.
TheRandomkid321: You say you're not one to judge, and yet here you are judging.
Laurayne but when they constantly say "Oh my god she's so hot" and "look at those bewbs" I don't want them talking with me.
TheRandomkid321: you were the one who talked with me and started this problem =_=
TheRandomkid321: You're taking being serious beyond the universe itself.
http://images.4chan.org/c/src/1350756603788.jpg
I Agree That We Can Talk About Whatever We Like, But Also Agree To Boundries. Keep It Clean And Friendly. Yes?
om hi i just got here first thing I see is Bronysith going celestia and luna are hot XDD
Listen I'm tired and stressed and I am on the verge of slicing my veins connecting my hand to my wrists okay the last thing I want is a mother fucking fight.
Bronysith: oooh, nice cosplay! :)
TheRandomkid321: get on with it
Both Of You Better Watch What You Say.
/me inb4 TheRandomkid321 grows bewbies and everypony calls him hot
Now the thing is
^
TheRandomkid321: So dark and edgy.
Jessica rabbit is the sexiest thing that a cartoon can ever make
nothing can be hotter than jessica rabbit

TheRandomkid321: Whats the problem
EVER
TheRandomkid321: You antagonize everybody. How can we be nice to someone who antagonizes everybody and everything?
>admitting yourself that bronies aren't civilized
TheRandomkid321: get over yourself and go back to ponychan if you cant handle it
TheRandomkid321: I Would Appreciate You Keeping Things Like That Stricly To yourself. Personally, I Wont Ague With You About That Situation. But Do Not Go There While You Are Here.

Bronysith: But you raised your voice.

You yelled. We don't yell here.

Kammerjunk: its dimming down
Hell gamers jb isnt on yet for some reason :/

Your gravestone will be only think you name is ritten on. it will become overhgrown as your sorpse works as a fertaliser. There is no afterlife. You will slip into eternal darkness.
"Stop startin'!" "No, YOU stop startin'!"
lol.
And it begins again
Oh geez, here we go...

11,01I see an internet argument has erupted since I was gone.
Came and gone already.
and suddenly Nittany_Discord
and now it's your job to keep the peace
Hello
That didn't sound right.
Yeah, practically out of nowhere. o_o
11,01Hi BroPony|MEDIC.
So much hate. T^T
it was horrible, Nittany_Discord
Oh thank buck a moderator
I have no words
^
I dunno, I came around the end because breaks.
oi dont make me use the dramablock again
Ain't no drama here, officer.
Never have I seen so much Slander aimed towards me in my life... well... to be fair it was returned with more slander...
Spectrum_Rush: Keep it at tthe ready
hello
11,01Hi.
hello pony_556
11,01Don't spam Spectrum_Rush.
tunnel of darkness
both parties were horribly immature
TheRandomkid321: You don't play a lot of FPS games with voice chat enabled, I take it.
Nittany_Discord: Oh, you missed one hell of a slapfight.
Kammerjunk Yes I do.
11,01I have a chat buffer. I read p.
Kammerjunk: Its call of duty i bet
11,01*up
And I usually don't mind. But on this place it really angers me.
No BF3
My approach to people calling me names is usually agreeing.
hmmmm....
Kammerjunk: always works! :D
ofc Nittany_Discord that was just to ya know make em knock it off
The voice support in CoD is bad anyway. It doesnt matter if you have a shitty mic or a $9001 headset, everyone sounds like crap.
nittany is investigating the scene
9001......
Nittany_Discord: it was traumatizing
there was blood EVERYWHERE
pony_556: Yup. Agree and joke about it.
it was more like chat crashingly stupid >->
/me wants a muffin :P
I was tired and angry okay?
I was laughing.
No excuse, kid

Kind of
<_< >_>
Am I the only one who loves it when two messages in succession have the same amount of characters in mIRC or any other IRC client using Courier New?
I got my sister to watch my little pony today
It pleases my OCD.
Sonny: What'd she say to it?
:3 Funny the places my mind travels when heavily sleep deprived - http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7959/
she loves it, not like it's good, or it's bad. She just likes says yes when I say we're watching mlp fim now
so yeah
she likes it in general :p
poot

Cypresswolf: O_O that was creepy
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Poll Results: How do You Watch Friendship is Magic?
You know what I love? The clop clip clop clip cloping sound ponies/horses make when they walk. Its just adorable in this show. Also, 2 coconut halves banging together works too.
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/8/N5qz6Bgy1USXp6eaW7fVyw2.gif

Cypresswolf: she's not creepy :D

Kammerjunk: nope, you just like hugs :D
^_^
MadSurge: http://mlfw.info/f/646/
By the way :) Are there any new ponies in chat this morning?
Kammerjunk: it's like reading books derived from movies :D
hugs?
Kammerjunk: and then saying the movie is boring
MadSurge: Or watching films from books/games. Except that's most excruciating.
Kammerjunk: it's a bit creepy... but cute.
Kammerjunk: yeah
Why would Twilight read about hugs?
:( hugs?
I am not a hugging man.
:'(
*hugs joshi222*
why not Kammerjunk :3
thelonepony: Hugs are awkward.
*sqee*
Hugs are for everyone
For people of all ages
But it makes you Bubbuly if you give hugs :3
Then again, my social knowledge is limited to "tie them to a chair and show films."
Well I'm bck
Back
^-^
If you think about it, a hug IS pretty boring.
Eli: did you see it
Regardless, I should probably get back to my essay.
shut up!
youre done pony man.
Gold_Demona: that's why I got for a kiss on the cheek as well ^-^
Panda: wut?

I mean, the only DOOM game I had is DOOM 64...
JRPhone: Go to bread :P
Now I haven't beaten that game, sadly...
I'm guessing its a wrek stream ?
/me slaps Bronysith with a lost soul
But I wished it has a multiplayer mode...
VenHur: u have one of the best doom games
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350805577951.png
best human cmc i've seen
cachi01 Mega_Milk Ponies47 what, you know that Garfixs and WUBS are 05% of the game! The other 5% are gore, bad language and 50 shades of brown
DOOM IV, you better come out with Wi-Fi support... :|
Humans=/=ponies

Is shizu bunny?
Because I played doom 3
O.o
>_> He's gone...Post humans
Lil_B: But this is a classic sir -lol anyone who has ever played doom or any survival 1st person shooter knows doom -lol
And then 20 monsters spawn and kill him
hi shizumobile sorry i couldnt find any good asuka pics
Howdy y'all!
shizumobile: an entire thread, AN ENTIRE THREAD and no good pics
Hai Everlasting_Joy
hey Everlasting_Joy whats going on
If there was multiplayer, Goldeneye 007 would of been a joke...no offense.
Everlasting_Joy: i would rename you eternal-orgasm
Howdy DerpyMuffins!
I liked Goldeneye 007 too.
VenHur: considering goldeneye actually brought FPS to consoles
pony_1284: I know I'm going to regret this, why?
But killing mutants in hell while being a badass...think about it.
Bronysith: I'm just goofing-off here, going to do some homework (ha!) and watch the game.
Everlasting_Joy: thats what k
HI Everlasting_Joy :)
i call Everlasting_Joy
Hey Everlasting_Joy :3
Howdy cachi01 and Ponies47!
Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
it derped
Howdy thelonepony!
Mega_Milk Mister, it may is beyond my to judge you style of sapeech, but your lols are breaking apart you credibility , I say, it was obvious, that me was just jestering!
BTW, who's streaming?
Hello Everlasting_Joy. :)
if doom 64 had multiplayer then goldeneye 007 would just be another obscure gem
Howdy VenHur!
Hi thelonepony and Everlasting_Joy :)

Hi, everyone. How are you all this morning? :)
I figured. I hear an accent, but it didn't sound like Wre-k's.
usually he's running around with 1% to 15%
Hello Lil_B and Mega_Milk :$
*heard.
hi AJIsAwesome :)
hey VenHur and MadSurge ;)
MadSurge: Sup.
Also, hi Everlasting_Joy and Lil_B. :)

I'm in a Fawfulish mood today, like if my mind was made out of peanuts and such.
Chainsaws <3.
I like using nomes as verbs or Adjectives xD

!cd
Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 19 days, 22 hours, 17 minutes, 34 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
I can hear doom but cant see it
Kammerjunk: you never heard me talking, did you?^^
Did I tell you about me and my buddy Keth played some doom?
Thanks tom.
nevermind
Only 19 more days
it's less then 20 days now :3
cachi01: :D, that, all of that.
Eli: It'll be fun to see how many people we get in mane chat at air time.
Dark_Horst: Eenope.
does someone else get Stuttering?
I do
19 days till cht is filled with spam and no one will be able to talk
we will fit 500 Kammerjunk
The weapons, the creativity of the levels, the gameplay, and SO. MUCH. BLOOD.
Eli: Oh, this chat has held over a thousand, if I recall correctly.
People spam spam when they saw Derpy the first time
Kammerjunk: yeah, you notice that i'm german. a lot. its horrible
cachi01: probably. all regulars should meet in one chatroom
Eli peak was above 3000
Lil_B: :O
Eli: <_< >_>
Lil_B: It's choppy for me.
Eli: oh yeah i forgot bout ke regulars room
I just see a black screen
Oh, and Doomguy is the brother of Duke Nukem.
Hi Lil_B !
I hear sound but black screen
Eli yeah, I would like for all regulars to meet in one chatroom :/ (I may have a sense already where, but the problem would be getting everyone there xD
I just hear studdering
yeah
likewise Derpy
hey Alchemist !
People are talking about the room! Hide the booze!
Lil_B: just anounce it once in a while
lol
I dont mean to offend anyone but I prefer watching the new eps in 720p and fullscreen without 3000 people reacting to stuff.
........
Alchemist: Oh, you should've been here for the Derpy episode.
Mods dont even open main chat room for shake of spam
Alchemist: lets just pray derpy isnt on the episode
Kammerjunk: :D
Kammerjunk: I saw a YT clip about it :D
Alchemist: I laughed to tears.
Alchemist: Same here. :D
VenHur: the game that made us wait for a disapointing sequel for over, what was it? 14 years?
yep
14
Eli it would be ether a certain chatroom I'm thinking about atm, or just open a new one called "#regulars" or something
duke nukem forever is good imo
^
DN forever was okay, but it didnt interest me enough to play through it.
Back
wolfenstein a.k.a the game that had robot hitler
DN Forever was bland.
cachi01: i have waited for that game all my thinking life... because of my big bro. i just had too high hopes
cachi01: That's how I remember it.
But I dont get why it was downgraded as much as it was.
Eli: Oh come on, Duke Nukem Forever is one of my favorite guilty pleasure games.
Eli: atleast it wasnt as bad as diablo 3
Lil_B, what room would you use for the regulars?
but yeh i liked duke nukem forever
Ohai Invi :3
VenHur: i think i just wasn't into the genre anymore after about 9 years
moin everypony ^^
hi Invi :)
Hey Invi! :3
Howdy Invi!
Eli: Sure, it's doesn't hold up to the hype of 12 years...12 EFFIN' YEARS!! ...But, i'm pleased with it.
hi Invi !
Hi, Invi! :)
Invi you are in it right know, and you can play card games there , but I still ont to ask the regulars there :P
/me Hides the booze
Invi: you've been here for hours
and guude Invi
hehe
Spectrum_Rush, I know :3
Invi: It isn't a secret club no matter what people might think, so #bronystateregulars
No booze here >_><_<
/me drinks all the beer
/me drinks Ponies47
Kammerjunk, ya, i know about that. i just asked lil_B ^^
Now I hope that the next Duke game doesn't take "Forever".
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Kammerjunk: Is that an example channel or didi you want people to go it?
*did
Why are we talking about the regulars room? :<
The Silly Filly room is always dead.
I played through DOOM I & II this Spring, but I never could beeat II's Final Boss
Kammerjunk: OH SHI
Maybe the same will happen to HL3
Lil_B: i've just finished chapter 1
AJIsAwesome: It's just a room some regulars use when mane chat goes berserk. It's also never +m
brb
Lil_B: im too lazy to play chapter 2 atm
Kammerjunk: Okay. Thank you. :)
yay
I don't even drink beer ._.
Sup everypony?
Kammerjunk: good for you
/me drinks Kammerjunk
I'm only 14 so I can't
but Kammerjunk YOU are beer
Ok maybe I've had a sip or to...
wait brb
Mass Efect 3 is also another one of my guilty pleasure games, I mean, sure the game was good up until the endings, but hey, who gives a shit?
And then, Kammerjunk was the beer.
Hi, DoctoDoctorWho.
Hi DoctoDoctorWho :)
:D
Adults were around!
Ponies47: Never stopped me <_< >_>
Hello DoctoDoctorWho.
It was new years@
!
Gimme a break
Ponies47: i think i was 14 when i got the first time really really drunk on beer
Ah Doom
same here. i asked my dad to give me a sip of his beer
he said ok just a sip
I like New Year's Eye. It's the only time of the year I get to drink champagne.
Eli: It was only a sip
IT TASTES LIKE URINE
:D
/me pets Spectrum_Rush ^^
Ponies47: and that's good like that. i don't like beer
It does have a rather strange taste.
If Bioware can make Mass Effect 4 with better endings, i'm sure the fans would calm down.
I prefer whiskey, anyway.
Maybe even scotch.
Mass Effect 4 is really a money grab
Ponies47: seriously: drinking isn't cool and i regret every mistake of my childhood
VenHur probably not
i wouldnt buy it
MY DICK WILL REVEAL AGAINST ITS CREATOR
the series is dead to me
VenHur: The odds of that are pretty damn small, actually.
Frog off?
But yeah, you can always blame EA for that...
Eli: Adults were around and plus they said I could and they said only a sip. Wait it wasen't beer... it was wine.
Invi: ya keep goin that an i'll fall asleep
VenHur: What can't you?
I don't see Mass Effect 4 having anything to do with Mass Effect 3 anyway
Nope. I'm blaming the people responsible for it: Bioware.
wine is fine
brb = be right back?
Spectrum_Rush, hmm?
i havent tasted wine but my brother has
he is 10
cachi01: ... i think wine is worse than beer
mitamaking: I don't see ME4 existing.
Hopefully.
Kammerjunk: I think they have confirmed it
but Eli YOU are wine
Unless EA gets a say in the matter.
Yeah, Bioware have flaws, like Sonic Chronicles. But I liked it.
GODDAMMIT
Bioware has gotten a free pass for too long, everyone saying "oh, it was probably just EA". No. Not this time. This didn't happen because EA forced them to do it.
This happened because they chose to do this.
cachi01: oh stop it you. making me all red. wait a minute
CriticKitten: What, the ME3 ending?
And then Eli and Kammerjunk were alcoholic beverages.
haha
Bioware
I didn't like Knight of the Old Republic and have never seen the appeal of Bioware
brb = be right back?! ;-;
And I think the company's creators finally got sick of it.
Eli: lol
/me Drinks AJIsAwesome
.....
:3
I don't know what you're talking about.
*sigh* Yes, applejack`.
KOTOR is good....for its time.
:D
but AJIsAwesome YOU are an alcoholic beverage
AJIsAwesome: yeah that's me. i get drunk on me too sometimes
:O
11,01I would think EA would milk ME dry.
Perhaps my biggest issue with TOR is that it feels like "KOTOR the MMO".
VenHur: thank you.
AJIsAwesomeIsTequila
:D
And that's not what they should've done. You need to evolve beyond your last title.
/me gives beer to VenHur
I have a link to Mass Effect 4 being confirmed
My biggest issue with TOR is that I can't kill enough people by choking them.
I think Ubisoft nailed the E3 conference with the annoucement of Rayman Legends, with Nintendo's in second with Pikmin 3's anoucement.
I Im back... hi:)
no really, am i the only one here who has his drinking phase already behind him? damn i'm only 19 :(
Or electrocuting hem.
"Speaking to VG247, BioWare Montreal producer Fabrice Condominas confirmed that while the series will continue beyond the current trilogy, it will be a completely separate experience."
them*
ubisoft and nintendo had the best conferences
Eli: It was only a sip :/
Ponies47: yeah... don't worry, it will be more later
mitamaking: 'Slong as they don't go with the whole "Yeah, Shep's still alive" thing, I'll probably download it at some point.
Eli: i will never drink
Ponies47: it's quite normal at a certain age...
im just 14 anyway
^
cachi01: you say that now...
Nintendo's conference was bad, Microsoft's was bad, Sony's was meh but the Book thing was horrible
and i think beer tastes like urine
Alchemist: :).
E3 was generally bad this year.
Sony's conference was *not* "meh".
It was AWFUL.
everything is terrible
Seriously...FUCKING. BOOKS.
Eli: I'm not a out going person so I don't go to parties. At all
11,01E3 is not really a game showcase anymore.
Nintendo's E3 was funny. NOBODY clapped.
VenHur: I know that's what I want to do when I play video games.
11,01At least the press conferences aren't.
Kammerscotch: What? :D
O.o
Their ONE new experience, the ONE new thing they had to show....was the Wonderbook.
AJIsAwesome: Nobody clapped at anything he said.
hello everypony
cachi01: and the next thing you know, you wake up at the border of a river where you and 5 duchebag friends who think drinking is cool, passed out
Wait, no... That was last year.
Wonderbook?
My brony story is a long one
Howdy DoctoDoctorWho.
last time*
Kammerscotch: That annoys me to no end, Microsoft announces crap and the crowd goes nut, Nintendo announces Golden Sun 3 and nothing
Everything else was a rehash of something we already knew about, or a remake, etc.
Kammerscotch: u kidding? shitloads of people clapped to pikmin 3
Mine is somwhat long.
*somewhat
cachi01: Yeah, I confused it with last E3.
Beyond? Oh, good, Heavy Rain starring Ellen Page, lemme get my wallet
Eli: O_o
Heavy Rain.... was new, which was nice
If I were to type it all out in one message it would be one hell of a text wall
Ponies47: brony stories? I saw the show, i liked the show. now i'm brony. over
Smash Smash Bros Sony? Oh goodie.
haha
ripoffs
CriticKitten: I can't wait to play all 2 characters.
Sony's conference SUCKED.
Lol
It sucked hard.
Kammerscotch: :D
Eli: Mine is a very long one :P
The thing is Nintendo has started to do the Directs
11,01CriticKitten: Bad world economy has devs and publishers turning to remakes and sequels to stay alive.
what I saw from E3s it seems they always try so hard to impress people playign video ga,mes and they fail so hard. Its awkward. Its like grandparents try to be "hip" and follow trends teenagers have.
There was literally no redeeming features to it. Reboots, rehashes, re-everything.
11,01I don't expect to see innovation from AAA gaming anytime soon.
mitamaking: Nintendo already owns all the biggest names in gaming so people arent too excited about them
I mean imagine if Nintendo announced Bayoetta 2 to end their conference, they would have won E3
What we need for the next E3 is a spritual Crash Banicoot game that's played just like the first three Crash games (Wrath of Cortex and Twinsanity inculded).
Nittany_Discord: Just enjoy what you have than?
i'd pay money out the ass for a new crash bandicoot
mita: No, people would've screamed bloody murder earlier.
11,01Exactly.
at least thats what I thonk...
that's good shit
A Spyro game, same as what I said for Crash, NOT THAT SKYLANDERS BULLSHIT!
I saw vids on youtube, clicked on the realted vids to 'Winter Wrap-up', found a 'commentary' on ep 3, decided to Really watch the show, and here i am now :D
I'm still waiting for VALVe to just come out and announce the next HL game already.
Until that happens, E3 will never be good.
No one can admit to themselves that Nintendo has presented the best lineup for their gamers every year for a few years now.
This nick is just silleh :P
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Dark Knight of Canterlot
Yes but the year Xbox got FF13 people screamed bloody murder but Xbox won E3 because of it
Kammerscotch then it will never be good
Which is sad, because they put forth a lot of remakes too.
they wont announce it
...I saw the show on 4chan.
even if they ever make it
Intensive Pony Unit and Fluttershy's Lament are main contributers as to why im a brony today <3
A new F-Zero and a Starfox game similar to 64!
theyll just drop it
my brony story: oh hey dafuq is this? (pony.mov) *watches it* LOLOLOLOLOL oh hey dafuq is this (cupcakes) *watches it* LOLOLOLOLOL *is now a andrew w.k fan* what dafuq is this? (how vegeta became a brony) LOLOLOLOLOLOL lets see an episode of the show. i will record it and then i'll watch it tomorrow (does it) LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL AND THATS MY STORY!
Then I downloaded the entirety of S1 in 720p and watched it.
I like Starfox Adventures!!!
...Oh, and Smash 4...
RaveBrony: i actually thought: how can anyone like that shit? if so many like it, it can't be THAT bad. OMGTHISISREALLYGOOD
mita: No they didn't. Nintendo has won for the last several years, honestly, but it's been a competition to see who can suck the least.
I didnt even know about bronies.... lmao
CriticKitten: Like the election race!
I think the last time they "lost" was their presentation of the Wii, but they got the last laugh there, too
CriticKitten how on earth would you say nintendo have won?
they announced the wiiu ffs
I was SO SCARED that no one else would like MLP when I did, hahaha
I disagree, using E3 to show off Nintendo Land, Nintendo Land, and um.... Nintendo Land was a horrible idea
Last year they presented Wii U.
exactly
This year was just them expanding on it.
thats a hell of a loss
Er, not really.
Chrysalis: I seem to recall a video of Gabe saying that they're working on the continuation to their Half-Life series. I remember because he never said "3" in that interview.
"I like a show for little girls, what the hell am I going to do!?!"
the wiiu is the only console to suck more than the wii
The Wii U fixes every problem the Wii had.
invisible monsters?? that is so OP....
Literally every one.
I think Wii U will be an improvment over the Wii because of better third party support.
The year Nintendo rolled out the Wii, 2006, was the best E3 conference ever
I was scared shitless after I became a brony. I was scared to know what mah family would think
yep
moving and killing stuff
11,01I expect E3 2013 to be sequels and motion controls just like 2012.
And yes, i'm buying the Wii U because of Pikmin 3 and Rayman.
Then i googles 'mlp fans', found EqD, and found Bstate from there :)
*googled
VenHur WiiU has probably the biggest Launch Lineup of every console ever
11,01Maybe a few new titles.
I first heard of the show via the KYM video.
I think Nintendo, if they even go, may win next year, the second year of a console is normally pretty good
btw did you hear about the wii U voice chat? the controller has a fucking microphone. but to voice chat YOU HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER MICROPHONE!
Mom: Likes me being a brony Dad: Meh Brother: Hates me to death for becoming one
hi guys :)
My family doesn't really give a damn.
Introducing the Playstation 3.5.
hi BronyInstrumental :)
cachi01: I have no problem with headset voice chat
Howdy BronyInstrumental!
hey BronyInstrumental
Graphics? Better than their competitors. Third party support? Apparently plenty, including numerous exclusives they showed us this year. Game lineup? They claim to have 50-some titles lined up for the December-March period, or some such thing.
and I'Äm back xD
My family doesn't mind either.
I would Smash 4 would fix the issues of Brawl.
My mom drove all the way out to Ohio for me just so I could go to Canterlot Gardens and I live in Wisconisn
mitamaking: i know but why would they force you to buy a mic if the controller already has a mic
NO Tripping. and NO online lag.
My mom's okay with it, and my dad supports me for being one.
Howdy Lil_B!
Wii U fixes a lot of the problems Wii had. I can't imagine how anyone looks at that and says "they lost E3 because of this" unless they're just not seeing clearly.
I told my mum I was going to order a purple necklace with an icon from a cartoon originally aimed at little girls, and she just say "oh, 'kay".
my dad doesnt even know AND HE WONT KNOW
My family jokes with me about it, but im so weird they just kind of..went with it :D
just said*
b-b-but nintenyearolds are just waggle babies
sony master race
rabble rabble rabble
RaveBrony: Same here. :D
Wii U is probably the console they SHOULD have presented instead of the original Wii. >_>
CriticKitten: I think third party support is being over done, look at EA, Nintendo gets Mass Effect 3, then at the same time the PS3 gets a trilogy release, they are sending Mass Effect 3 out to die, then cancel all future support due to it floppinf
Lol
*flopping
mita: It's possible. Won't know until a year or two down the road.
11,02i liek nintendo though ;~;
ded
my mum and dad just were like "yeah whatever" when I told them
ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
I have to see my grandma everyday and I haven't even told her yet. She has seen my brony wristband and asked me what it is I just tell her it's nothing. I don't think she would really get the whole brony thing
11,02Hai :3/
But they are nailing a lot of decent exclusives as well.
So yeah. Mane chat is not arguing about games.
NintendoHard, on PC :P
And Ubi is in their back pocket.
is now*
Im with you there NewSuperBronyU
NewSuperBronyU everybody sewcretly loves Nintendo :3
I'll go to the store with my family, and they'll ALWAYS point me toward the mlp section in the store and pick up the Worst merch and say, "Loook how cuuuute, do you want this SON?"
Platinum Games might be, as well.
Ohai NewSuperBronyU moo :3
Nintendo is MLG
Ponies47: Same with my grandparents.
11,02Moo :3
:D
You could just tell her its from a show. Nothing more. :)
ohai NewSuperBronyU :3
If they get EA, they're in good shape.
I mean look at what Capcom did to the Wii, you get a rail shooter and a remake, if those sell we will give you a new game, they sold, another rail shooter, or Dead Space, or Castlevania, or Soul Calibur
b-b-but nintendo can only do rehashes! play something fresh and new
Like Dea Space 3
or Call of Duty 5
Lil_B: my mom was like ''WHO IS RECORDING MY LITTLE PONY?'' and i was like ''not me'' then she was like ''then im going to erase the recording'' and then i was like NONONONONONONONONON :I
/me noms on Buytoast
RaveBrony: That's just mean D:
RaveBrony: Do you then laugh and pick something good?
:D
Buytoast: I love that argument, too.
you are lucky basterds... i think my brother knows.. but he ignores it
I dont have any consoles and never had a NES/SNES so let me just say that the Sovngarde music theme kicks ass in skyrim.
Did they ever make Call of Duty 5?
Kammerjunk: Yeah I don't think they my grandma would get it.
Buytoast they ARE doing new Stuff, but only a couple are noticable
Ponies47: How they say it, it isnt, dont worry :D
my grandma doesnt give a shit
Kammerjunk: You bet! lol
Especially since any given pair of "rehashes" from Nintendo tend to differ more than CoD clones. >_>
o-o-or even Gears of War 4!
WAW was Cod 5
11,02Black Ops II is Call of Duty 9
Except for New Super Mario Bros Wii U, because screw that.
Im not crazy about pony merch tho
lol Nintendo is what started the gaming genre
CriticKitten: I agree
inb4 RaveBrony has all pony merch
I have the McD toys and 4 blind bags (Rarity, and the 3 special ones)
cachi01: I laughed from imagining your grandma saying "I don't give a shit" and laughing.
DerpyMuffins ok there I dissagree xD
Kammerjunk: :D
I still need to find a gosh darned Applejack.
cachi01: Lol! :D
Alright it's what started the gaming genre in the 90s
My main problem with Nintendo's conference this year is how they pulled TWO Mario games for the same year.
Kammerjunk: BLindbag?
My little brother once watched me play TF2. i was on a brony server, but we weren't on a brony map. and i thought: no problem. then my bro asks: "why is there a pony on the dispenser?" i was like: shit
At all.
mita: Of course, because you have sense. There are people out there who will seriously claim that Black Ops 1 and 2 differ more than, say, Ocarina of Time vs Twilight Princess.
RaveBrony: I don't have any MLP toys. I just have T-shirts, a Scootaloo hat, and a brony wristband, and a poster, and few drawings from artists
Yaaaay, You won! NOW DIE
RaveBrony: lucky you. :D
Nintendo Land is going to be fun, Pikimin 3 should be great, Wondeful 101 and Bayonetta have me excited, but other than that, I don't like what I see in the WiiU
Eli: Lol!!
THOSE are the people who need to be beaten with hammers.
DerpyMuffins: uh no Nintendo only saved the industry after the great viseo game crash of 83
game wise
Yes, we all love Mario and what's not, but seeing two games for the same year is overkilling.
Ponies47: Nice :o
*video
RaveBrony: i love the ponyspensers, but i totally forgot about them
11,02Nintendo was making games before any other video game company today :3
I'm holding out on Wii U until the Zelda title.
Yeah :P
I love Mario, just Mario's 3D games
i think i used to have an applejack McDonalds toy before i was a brony and i think i dropped it to the trash.................god fucking dammit
Eli: When my brother found out I was a brony....
NewSuperBronyU: Activision
E3 2013, calling it now.
@ mario games the same year? Why are you complaining?
New Zelda.
I ordered two shirts from WeLoveFine back in the Steampunk competition, and got a steampunk MLP poster.
2
It looks great.
In HD.
NewSuperBronyU Nintendo Card Game Manufactorer, founded 1889 :P
Ponies47: big or little bro?
NewSuperBronyU: yeah and they owned brothels too :S
Kammerjunk: I have a steampunk RD bag. :3
Nice, Kammerjunk. :O
Smile Everypony, you will be on a screenshot I will post on github
Eli: Big
11,02Activision was founded in 1979, Nintendo was founded in 1889 :)
I love Steampunk soooo muuuuch
AJIsAwesome: WeLoveFine gives so much stuff out, it's insane.
^
Ponies47: I am jelly.
NewSuperBronyU: Smart pony
I LOVE Steampunk.
Ponies47: how much older?
Is Nintendo that old?
mitamaking I just told him :/
Nintendo has to be the most oldest living video game company to date.
I just wish I had the money to make Steampunk outfits and such...
Nintendo started making "Hanafuda" Cards
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh
The Legend of Zelda: Modern Warfare
i want this t-shirt so fucking hard http://www.redbubble.com/people/dfragrance/works/7778523-monochrome-dash?p=t-shirt
Title on www.redbubble.com: "Monochrome Dash" T-Shirts & Hoodies by Rachael Thomas | Redbubble
Same.
11,02Lil_B: I knew about it before :)
NewSuperBronyU probably :P
Nintendo just readded their Hanafuda cards to Club Nintendo, yay
Funny thing?
And fun fact: They were once a card company, a love hotel, etc.
Everyone is mocking Nintendoland now.....
hey guys
Kammerjunk: Best part is. It has RD on BOTH sides not just on one BOTH. How did I get one with RD on both sides? I got it at Canterlot Gardens. You buy one shirt from thenm and they give you one big bag :P
Hi alexxm :)
VenHur: didnt knew about the hotel
I'll go ahead and make another prediction: it'll be the top selling Wii U title.
VenHur: dat wiki info start
Ponies47: Do they ship worldwide?
CriticKitten: Well, it is silly, doesn't mean it is not going to be fun
how are things thelonepony
Or at least in the top ten.
the Gameboy came out at their 100th annivbersary
Eli: He's 17 ATM, I'm 14
Why? Because look at the top titles on the Wii.
/me Shrugs at Kammerjunk
CriticKitten: That is like saying that Wii Sports was the top selling Wii game, no s***, it came with the system
Eli: He was 16 when he found out
even though Nintendo is 100 years old, Satoru Iwata is I think only the 3rd Prewsident
Ponies47: he wasn't as understanding then, i guess?
Thats Japanese commitment
120years*
mita: That number isn't counting all the copies that came with the system. Because originally it didn't come with the system.
Eli: No he understood it all. He no like poniez :<
I want aRarity beanie.... thats ALL i ask.... A preferably Black, but could be White, beanie with Rarity's Cutie mark on the side near the rim....
I love Nintendo so much, not only they made some of the greatest games, but they also bring video games back from the depths of non-existent.
I want a plushie ;A;
CriticKitten: Yes it is, Wii Sports did not sell 60 million copies by itself
^
I also love the fact that both WeLoveFine and Redbubble accept PayPal.
Hello everypony
I would want one if they werent so damn expensive
pinkie pie saves everyone
RaveBrony: Agreed. :D
RaveBrony: i would order me a beanie, but yeah. nothing's ever gonna replace my skabeanie
but I do wanna Slap the Person behind "Takamarus Ninja Catsle" in Nintendo Land >.<
Lol :D
Hi, Coldays. :)
All of my shirts are from WeLoveFine
For the love of hoof, are we still arguing about what game developer is the best?
hi Coldays :)
Im not paying $100+ for a stuffed animal
11,02No-one is mocking Nintendo Land really...people have found it to be pretty awesome for what it offers.
Dat "couple more"
Kammerjunk: not really, it is all Nintendo discussion now
The scrooge in me wont allow it
^^
NewSuperBronyU i am
its as bad as playstation home
200 dollars for a plushie is fucking expensive
if not worse
NewSuperBronyU I know, trhe game looks really fun, but I still wanna slap the person who did that
because they didnt learn from sony's mistakes
I also have a Derpy mousepad :3
Playstation Hime, do you mean Second Life?
Jelly?
redbubble accepts debit card?
:3
Always that "Couple more" :D
There was this Swedish guy on BronyState just short of half a year ago called Misha. He asked who uses shirt size S, and then he randomly sent me a Luna shirt.
Chrysalis: You are confusing Nintendo Land with Miiverse
11,02Anyway, bbl, I'm going to the lake to swim with Sea Poniez :)
... [raises hoof] ...I played Second Life...
So that was nice of him.
oh yeah Mishia. where the hell is he?
Kammerjunk: Nice.
mita: You think every single copy of Wii Sports is a console sale, then?
https://twitter.com/i/#!/Ponies47/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FNJDFtISR Dat's my Scootaloo hat :3
Title on twitter.com: Twitter
Play Dune 2 :P
NewSuperBronyU|AFK simply because Takamaru (from the old japanese only NES Game) was a Samurai
NewSuperBronyU: See ya.
CriticKitten: Not every in the world, but in the US, almost
Misha isnt around anymore??
title on twitter: twitter lol
RaveBrony: Haven't seen him in a long time.
cya
Ponies47: THat's awesome. :D
mita: Because that would be impossible. The Wii has sold more units than Wii Sports. :P
I havent seen him recently, but yeah...
oh m
Hey guys
Ponies47: really? that's kinda silly
People come and go :'(
hi ASoftFluffyThing :3
good eveniung
yeah
ASoftFluffyThing: Sup kid.
evening
Hi oGriofa :)
RaveBrony: I know, right? :(
I really like his accent.
hi
Chocolate DOOM...hmm...
Hi Applejack2012 :)
Ponies47: Nice :o
Pinkie would like that mod.
btw remember TheRainbowDash? where the hell did he/she go? school?
Hi, oGriofa. :)
College.
Chocolate rain
mita: Because, as I said, the game didn't originally come with it. And in some territories it didn't come with the console at all, and STILL sold like crazy.
It came with the system in the US, not worldwide, it was a great seller, but look at the list, Super Mario Brothers was the top selling NES game because it came with the system
wait he was playin doom
He's been very busy, I hear.
AJIsAwesome: I told Scoot-Scootaloo if I ever go to Bronycon and meet up with him I will let him wear it for the day :3
/me hugs the thelonepony
:3
witch one
Ponies47: NIce! :D
"In Japan, where the game was not included with the system, the game sold 176,167 copies in the first two days of release"
I'm doing fine, Mega_Milk. Just got home from church.
All you guys are relatively new faces to me :D
Eli: What? My hat?
mitamaking: And that game was a damn fine good one.
RaveBrony: Thanks
If BroNYCon still exists in 10 years, I'll be there.
Ponies47: yep
Ponies47: looks silly
Eli: But I like it :<
It's sold damn near 2 million copies in Japan alone. >_>
Well ive seen Kammerjunk for a While now
ASoftFluffyThing: Kool.
Wii Sports sold great, I imagine around double Wii Sports Resorts number
I don't even plan next week, but I've planned my life in 10 years from now.
ive been 6 or 7 months in here
without the system
So many people I knew when i came here are now gone :D
Gonna look at some halo 4 stuff on youtube now.>_>
Ponies47: i like ponies, but i would never cosplay as one :/ or even wear such a hat
11,01I do miss when systems came with games by default.
6 months here. :)
hey
11,01Though you can get bundles today.
Nittany_Discord: same
Well, I'm been here since the S2 premier, but I was a brony since around the end of S1.
I've been here*
In a week ill have been here for 11 months :D
So yeah, let's not lie to ourselves here. Wii Sports sold like crazy and not just because "it was a package with the console". Because it still sold like cupcakes in countries that it WASN'T packaged in with,
Nittany_Discord: thank goodness for bundles.
Lucky. :D
what does it matter?
i became a brony sometime before its about time was aired
I've been here since May 7th 2012 :3
I would've LOVED to have been here for the S2 premiere.
i miss the nes days nittany
Eli: Becuz you see new faces, then they leave once you get to know them :(
CriticKitten: I am not saying it was just because of the system bundle, but I will say the outrageous number is because of the system pack in
So, what be going on, guys?
And mita: Little over 30 million copies on Wii Sports Resort. :P
Early April, if I can recall. :D
11,01SNES too.
But I mainly just lurked. :D
CriticKitten: simple games, perfect for kids, variety, what's not to like?
me too
Did anyone here talk to Ictiv?
Ictiv?
O.o
who?
Yeah.
me three
What is with all this Nintendo talk?
I haven't seen him in a while.
wall of Nintendo talk¨
Who's Ictiv?
Compare that to any other game on any other console, and you will find the latter doesn't match up. >_>
RaveBrony: i'm nere since June. it's fun :) i actually found out about this site quite late
Was it really that much, man I haven't checked the numbers in a while
I dont even recognize the name
^
A guy who used to be on BronyState.
Hmm
CriticKitten: Super Mario Brothers on the NES
Ah.
cause nintendo used to be great now they suck
Well, compare to, say, Black Ops.
I try to get the WiiU + ZombiU Bundle
Inafter moustache.
Hello everyone.
What would he do?
Another one of Bstate's debates
aloa Meanwhile
hi
Hello, Meanwhile. :)
Hai Meanwhile
Hi Meanwhile :)
DerpyMuffins has to be!
anyways, gotta dash. might be on later
Eli: I found out about this site a week after i became a brony. I was worried since Ive never chatted online before :D
MrPoniator is always here but he never speaks
Bye Eli
hi
see ya guys
Why's there activity in here, it's Sunday.
Talk about Hitchhiker's Guide and make pony-themed parodies of songs.
Cya eli
He is?
Hi Meanwhile
cya Eli
AJIsAwesome: yes
bye, Eli. :)
AJIsAwesome: in mane room
*Eli
Wow.
how are things Meanwhile
hi
I mean Wii Sports is nearly 80 million, I imagine a lot would have been sold, but over half are due to the pack in
Never knew that.
Meanwhile: Mane chat was obsessing over which game developer was best.
Guys save teh disccusions for a side chatroom, not main one
i love the controller not the new gimmicks seems like console are dieing
^
Uncomfortable alexxm. How about you.
^^
My favorite Mario game is Sunshine, and SMB2 in a close second place.
That's my cue to bolt.
How silly.
I find them underrated...
Aw
Indeed.
i'm good Meanwhile what happened to you
Everyone knows game developers are all evil.
Black Ops has....*checks* 25 million, I think? So Wii Sports Resort even beats THAT. :p
I'm fine too
11,01I loved Mario 64 and SMW.
VenHur: Galaxy>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>all
thats why i play pc games now
Because they're the blacksheeps of the Mario games.
Nittany_Discord: Same.
I found this website after about 2 weeks Season 2 finshed I became a brony February 18th 2012 :3
alexxm: Sufficed to say talking about it would not be pleasant for chat.
11,01Thought it was publishers?
me too smw was awesome
VenHur: How hipster of you
Oh who cares, they're all evil.
Ponies47: Nice :P
i miss the koopa kids
So, bet on it: Nintendoland will sell. A lot.
Super Mario Galaxy is best
Yoshi's Island and SM64 all the way :P
Hey, no need of sarcastism. Everyone have different tastes.
lol not that game
Whether packaged into the console or not.
Koopa Kids are in the New Super MArio series, just not Bowser's kids
oh ok Meanwhile
It WILL sell.
RaveBrony: Same weekend "A Friend in Deed" aired but my first episode was "Lesson Zero"
Clock. Is. TICKING!
wendy was my fav
Im glad I became a brony before the Derpy ep, I actually got to "geek out" :D Even tho i dont much care for Derpy
have some awesome music till there is a stream: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRsiwBoUQPM
Ponies47: your first bmn?
I'm not gonna get myself wrapped up in this Nintendo chat
I hope I don't miss class this Tuesday. I can't afford it.
I would like to know if Nintendo Land is local only, if that is try than I won't buy it
CriticKitten: I disagree, but it is with the console, it will sell, and then the system will sell, Wii Sports sold the Wii
true*
Ponies47: Lol :D
Lil_B: Local only
mitamaking ok, I'm gonna skip that
I knew I was a brony when I watched A Dog And Pony Show and laughed through all of it. :D
cachi01: Can't remember well I joined May 7th and that was a Monday. I would have to look up what the movies were that week
I did.
There's a stream?
Was
Nope.
was indeed now we wate
Meanwhile was until 5min ago, may start in 25min again
Ponies47: mine was coraline/clue but.. i really cant remember you in that date.
I offically called myself a brony when the MMMystery on the Friendship Express aired.
Lil_B, what was on?
i didnt catch that
I don't have the site up anyway, I've been watching Two Best Friends on youtube.
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350837617691.jpg
I cant remember the exact Day i came here
http://www.vocaltwit.com/4734
oh okay
BOO
Twilight's insanity in "Lesson Zero" is the thing that got me.
But i know it was the week after 'anime week'
i remember NewSuperBronyU|AFK was playing some weird DS game about rubbing girls
Crazy Twilight FTW <3
... Invi... GEMA blcoked the Video?
^
Dat Chrysalis <3
Lol
Lil_B, indeed. it's about 7 minutes long...
How long have you been here, Meanwhile?
Sean Austin is a brony?
mita:Not only will it sell, there will be a sequel too. Wii Sports has already proven this to be fact. :P
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350838404420.png
http://i.imgur.com/56RYo.jpg
CriticKitten: I agree
wgere did that come from mitamaking
Hang on I have to look up the movie date.
Invi but... but.. how can there possibly be something in there to block??!!!???
Bronysith: ............
alexxm: What Rex posted
The only thing that I thought I was gonna hate about the show as I thought the "THE WORST POSSIBLE THING" thing from Rarity was a running gag in the show. I was wrong
ASoftFluffyThing: :D
*was
/me pokes AJIsAwesome
:D
I've been here since the 27th of May, 2011.
:o
Damn, lol
/me puts quarantine signs around her with a box of tissues
Lil_B, you would have to know what goes on in the confused crazy mids of those people to answer that question...
*minds
brb
ASoftFluffyThing: Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were sick. :(
CriticKitten: I don't know if it will sell without the system, but it is with the system, it will thus sell and get a sequel(maybe with a second tablet?)
Wow.
The 3rd movie night the site ever did. Monty Python and the Holy Grail followed by Evil Dead 2.
I was here for 'I Am Legend (2007)'
GEMA is ifs nuts... this is actually Against the law...
I was here for Zombieland and that sheep movie.
Jan 6th, 2012 :D
Lil_B, I'll ask ehm if he can stream it for us .3
it is?
AJIsAwesome, meh I'm fine.
oh stream is back ^^
If I have a fever you'd know
streams back
ASoftFluffyThing: Okay. :)
Invi n I don't want S3 spoilers xD I just wanna rage
I loved watching Ip Man tho
May 7th is the first time I came here. May 20th, I was banned for a hour for posting gore (I will never forget that), so I've been here for 6 months and 2 weeks :P
Ip man was beast
i see sat's schtream ^^
Man, I loved Zombieland. :D

Ip man was way more awesome than I thought it'd be.

Lil_B, still, it's ridicolous what they do ^^
Batman
I remember when I first came here. I didn't know how the site went so I just kept requesting stuff over and over again. Man, was I stupid. :S
Trady!
Tardy
He's Batman. because he's the Batman god damnit.
I still facepalm at that today.
WAIT! Now I remember what my first movie night was. It was the movie night of Monty Python and the Holy Grail
Also, how in the blazes is Seaponies > Leverage?

Hello Katalenic.
hi
Huh
When I first got here I started talking in colours before it was autokicked, then accidently got my colour stuck on grey.
08,01my harddrive is called TARDIS because it's bigger on the inside and makes funny noises
how are things Katalenic
its the OST just if ya'll couldn't tell
lulz
In my defense, grey looked like white.
well everything is fine alexxm ^^
08,01this is the OST from Mask of the Phantasm
damn batman had some epic music
Way to go.
^^^^^^
But over time, I managed to learn how things went here, and I quickly adapted.
^^^^^
Isn't it from the animated series?
i think i joined april 5 or 6
klrpwny73
Invi yes, normaly it should go like this "We have rights to this contend, block it uuntil he can proofe he has licenced it"
When I first came here, i was sorta... spastic, to say the least
Jmo
D:
when i first came here i started a conversation about cupcakes fic :D
wasnt until dari banned me that i became tame
Lil_B, sad but true :<
Hey guys.
Yeah, I was a little spastic about being a brony at first.
hi ASoftFluffyThing
Hi, ASoftFluffyThing. :)
I rememeber I tryed joining the website before May 7th but I was getting pissed because LightIRC wasen't working for me and I had no idea how to access the chat in a diffrent way but then one day LightIRC just magically started working
Oh hi, ASoftFluffyThing.

Scoot-Scootaloo: I see Batman:Mask of the Phantasm, you must not be MLG enough to see it :S
Kammerjunk: OH YEAH, they're called seasons in USA. Sorry. :D

Stupid brain. :P

You cant follow the chat unless you can see the stream (most of the time)
le wild dog appears. he used lick
I've been trying to get Kung Pow as a B movie. :)
that and it's been a year since it's been shown
Ponies47: Yes. :D
Rex_Mundi: dat badass
08,01Rex_Mundi: i'd get that tattoo
Has Kung Pow ever been aired here?
I have a REALLY good TV movie. Atleast B movies can be TV
let me check
I'd get that Poster... because I don't want Tatoos on my skin :)
I wish I had a tatoo like that...IF I HAD ONE!
Has Titanic been shown?
I'm not sure......
Im getting a Twilight tattoo
I don't think so.
Just her cutie mark
Try asking one of the mods.
VenHur, you wish you had a tatoo if you had one?
Speaking of...how was Titanic 2?
I don't think I was here for that.
Me neither. :D
Well I got my movies and such that I shall enter into the raffle until one is choosen :P
I dont choose a B movie, lol
08,01i want a pinkie pie tattoo
08,01not sure where
I rarely watch them anyways
Sif you didn't get the reference.
Your moon?
In fact, would the Sonic OVA be considered a B movie?
Finding Nemo for A, all the way!! :D
get Pinkies cutiemark on the flank :D
Lolwut?
Not pony related, but just look at this thing http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/bowser.jpg
Makes sense
I just hope the TV movie I got gets picked before my A movie. The TV movie (A.K.A my B movie) is a classic
COnsidering the fact that it was combined into a movie in all regions beside Japan.
08,01Invi: on the side of my ribs?
blank flank forever :D
Dat Bowser
Upper arm?
Also it seems when ever I talk about it no one ever knows what movie I'm talking about
What movie, Ponies47?
my friend is getting two rainbow dash cutie mark tattoos on his waist
ASoftFluffyThing: Titanic 2 was bland.
tomarow
i'll vote your highness for A movie and bee movie for b movie
Ponies47: I thought you wanted to keep it incognito. :D
bee movie
b movie
ASoftFluffyThing: I can't tell. Otherwise people might take it.
C WUT I DID THER
EH
HA
AJIsAwesome: What?
08,01Invi: that's not the flank
cachi01: DOhohohhohoho
cachi01, I like that movie. It's cute
Ponies47: The movie.
Plus, it's Dreamworks
/me shrugs ''have never studied anatomy''
cute doesnt change the fact its bad
Shit, I like Dreamworks

DaringDerpy: ah. have been there 2 weeks ago... smelly really
http://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/ich-esse-lieber-hunde-als-katzen-id168174.html the typical swiss :P
11,01Forgot chat likes to spam that song.
Ponies47: red eyes FUCK YEAA
DaringDerpy: and if you read it in the BLICK i can asure you it's NOT true. no matter what they write
11,01*during
BroHoof: DARK red to be exact

DaringDerpy: it's the blick... i knew it
Ponies47: DARK! red... i want eyes like those
Eli: don't take it personally...was never meant this way

it's something you just don't talk about
DaringDerpy: if it says "BLICK" in red and white in the corner, no matter if tabloid or newspaper, don't listen to it. it's trash and propaganda. all swiss ppl know so
Ponies47: btw look at dis tell me what u think i'll pm to ya
it's a valuable insight into swiss everyday culture
Hey would anybody happen to have a spare canteen for TF2? I don't have one. :/

Eli_damn_my_laptop_d: i'm in
Phase4: I couldn't agree with you more. I always have to move my Sentry during MvM
ich spreche auch deustch!
oGriofa: you're not. believe me
BroHoof: your steam?

Ponies47, /)
Eli_damn_my_laptop_d: meanofdeath
Phase4: (\
6ill be back i have to go take my meds
BroHoof: Vin as a profile?
Ich spreache auch Deustch!!!
Phase4: We should Mann up Mode together sometime. I'm a pretty decent Engineer
Eli_damn_my_laptop_d: yep
hab hir das noch nicht gemearkt?
Ponies47, dual engi is best engi setup
cloud is best pony
Bajocantinuo: auf*
Phase4: I couldn't agree more to that either
Has someone ever streamed an All "TF2 character" match besides Scout?
ok BroHoof. let's go. who else will join us?
In terms of Mvm.
tut mir leid mein Deustch sucks ballz
lol
Eli: hoold on i think i gave the wrong acc ._.
from the games i've played, ideal is two engi, two heavy, a money collector (spy or scout, prefferably scout) and someone to pick off sneaks (soldier, demo)
BroHoof: :P
Bajocontinuo: lolwut
I rememeber this one time I was playing MvM we were all Medics! :D
:D
XD
How did that go? :D
Eli: it was portalmaster12 xD sry
:D
all engi is fun
Ponies47, oh lol that was hilarious
Phase4: i would LOVE to see that :D
An all medic game?
was i in that game ponies47?
i like trains
that sounds familiar
So many callings for Fluttershy
BRB taking a shower
Buytoast: I think so
Buytoast, I think you were. You were beating everyone up
I would love to know how it ended
test
k
Bajocontinuo: Deine Deutsche sprache ist grottenschlecht
Phase4: Yes all engi would be awesome
cachi01|shower: A+!

A+?
/me flips table
I WANT F
You said test. :P
oGriofa lol Danke dir !!!!!!!
Eli, I would but gotta wait till tomorrow
ASoftFluffyThing: why?
god i love little big planet vita
Good thing I'm no longer F2P. I got spare Mann up Mode tickets as well :3
cachi01|shower: i adore that game x)
Eli, because on of my Acer's USB port is broken, which shorted the other port. And secondly I have TF2 on my sister's laptop.
Who else here is getting Halo 4?
I haven't played TF2 as long as I would have wanted to.
Ponies47: lucky ._.
uh oh
wow
you really needed that other sentry
So I'm guessing the term F2P is designated to new players of a certain game?
Ponies47: i hate being a F2P :<
AJIsAwesome: It stands for "Free 2 Play".
Dat reload speed :O
cachi01|shower: did they make anyway to get the games boght for the old psp on discs to work on the vita, or do you have to buy it again?
i was never a f2p
BroHoof: Buy something from the store
AJIsAwesome: no it's free to play :3
and then your no longer F2P
Kammerjunk: I know that. but it seems that people use it to describe themselves. Why?
twilight_sprinkle: you have to buy it again :/
BroHoof: change it then
cachi01|shower: thats ridiculous
twilight_sprinkle: yes it is
i was F2P for about a week
Ponies47: i know but i got no credit card to buy money for steam if i had i would :/
twilight_sprinkle: i'll just wait for cfw to get into vita so i can just download isos for free
then my backpack was full and i bought some cheap item
AJIsAwesome, theres nothing in MvM that you can't do without paying money, except for the weapons at the end of round and tours
I am not Rainbow dash i am my original character BLAINBLOW BLASH!!!
cachi01|shower: cfw?
BroHoof: Ask yo parents? :P
Phase4: AH.
Okay.
AJIsAwesome: Well, if someone is F2P, they got the game after it went free - however, if and when they buy something from the store (In the case of TF2), they're no longer F2P.
twilight_sprinkle: custom firmware
Ponies47: they don't have credit cards xD
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350841877263.gif
BroHoof: :<
Okay, thanks Kammerjunk and Phase4. :)
Wait, you can't play MVM if you're F2P?
Bajocontinuo: Brainlow Crash?
AJIsAwesome, and the weapons are just normal drops, end of tour weps are reskins of the stock weps
cachi01|shower: ah, cfw is good
LOL
cachi01|shower: be careful not to break your psp though
Kammerjunk: just buy something that costs nothing
Ohai twilight_sprinkle :3
Kammerjunk: or 50 cents
Ponies47: i'm lookin for any way i could buy a prepaid steam wallet card but no luck
see ya all later guys i am gonna eat dinner its 22:08 here

PeachStreak: I think it's nice. :)

cachi01: you don't like him either i take it
O
I line of colour is sufficient
cachi01: what's your steam name?
*a
Eli: wait we aint talking about the brohoof minecraft server?

Wee got tech smart people in here right?
*Weve
AJIsAwesome: any thoughts on changing the song
O ok

so it simply means I am not available for a moment
Define tech smart
:(
cachi01: i'm kinda perma muted on that server because he doesn't like it when i tell him to get the fuck out
And what you need help with
O ok well i gtg
lol
If it's web design or any programming I'm useless
TF2 is CONSTATLY loading as my 'top' program/
What a horrid mod
top program?
I don't even know what's going on in TF2 anymore.
sounds like an average team fortress 2 mod
Im sick 'alt-tab'ing and tf2 remains on top
RaveBrony: oooooh
Aaah I know that feel
Eli: worst admin ever huh :P? i remember when i was playing on some counter-strike server where the admins where hacking, but i was killing them anyway(withot hacks) so they banned me, and they didnt know how to permaban so i kept rejoining anyway :D
PeachStreak: It seems that timing on some of the instruments don't sync up with each other that much. Also, the dubstep seemed a little out of synce with the tempo. :)
I have to go up and click on the 'minimize' button
RaveBrony: uhmmmmmm saint google might help
*sync
Buytoast: we need Derpy to kick him out :D
twilight_sprinkle: :D
ya I noticed criticism is always welcome in my book
twilight_sprinkle: :D
All i got from Google was "Im having the same problem, please help, its really annoying"
Man, why do I have to be allergic to things I love so much.

Eh, guess ill do deal with it then... Thanks tho :)
Stallion_of_War: that's generally how TV shows work. They air, then when they're finished there's a break until the next year
Well, I had given blood before today. It's just that I didn't properly process my emotions according to my sister's scary passing out from a piercing before hand :S
*ill just
Stallion_of_War: that's how it works with ALL shows.
dat pinkie gif
Hello
*processed
hi Socks
So calm thine tits and stop acting like you've been wroned with not a damn thing has happened.
Hi, Socks. :)
Polydunami: I could never give blood...needles and I got into a real bad fight when I was 4
Hey Invi, Hey AJIsAwesome
Bronysith: that day the world will be a happier place :$
Polydunami: wow..
Hi Socks L)
:)*
Hey lonepony :)
hell, you should celebrate considering Korra's getting another 26 episodes after Book 2
Yeah, I had given blood three times before. My blood type is O negative
i aint giving blood
That's the unfortunate part.
And here we go again :P
they wnt it they'll have to take it from my cold dead hands
i gave some blood just for some studies
*sigh* I miss having a computer that could run TF2 :(
I'm O negative as well. :D
Nice
Polydunami: i had to give blood from the vene once every few days at one point in my life, ive done it a loooot. i actually almost fainted the first time, for some weird reason, but i was fine every other time
then you'd be the perfect organ donor, Buytoast :P
/me is O positive
/me is pootis
RAWRity: same here
I'm O negative, but I have more of a B+ attitude :3
I believe I'm O+
my blood is A+ bro
looks like the chat went *puts sunglasses on*
BLOODY
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I got AB-
we post our blood types now?
You're a sight for sore eyes, DerpyMuffins :3
I have to go, cya
diddutz: I guess so. :D
Whats that mean?

No. :D
I only found out what my blood type was because I gave blood once.
And BWH
I got 0 k neg. Rh pos. CCD.ee (D pos.)
Well, teh first time

/me has no idea what is going on
Stop that cake!
Tank! Keel it!
Right, I forgot. DerpyMuffins, your plasma is compatible with all blood types.
and average BPM of your heartbeat
So whats that mean for me?
so, a/s/l/bt/ssn/bwh/bmi/bpm
While we're at it, why don't we post our passwords to our email addresses and facebooks? :P
Where the hell do the others go? Poor Nittany was alone killing all them bots
11,01Probably incapped by the winter mitten heavies.
Pyroland is best land
MadSurge: Nittanys main job shoud be getting the monies
I didn't know this was going to become a big thing :D
MadSurge, in MvM it only shows your kills
For some reason.
Lost connection to the server :/
Anyway, I'm over it. I'm going to be busy later on tonight, however.
What is your age, sex, location, credit card number and mothers maiden name?
.........
OK I've got 3 horror genre games i plan to play. Which one should I choose first: Amnesia, Resident Evil 4 or Silent Hill 2.
:P
so.. I'm in time for the idle show?
/me banishes Socks to the 5th dimision
Whose show?
SirGanjalf: Resident Evil 4.
http://cheezburger.com/6674003456
Socks: 19, male, germany, don't have one, Kringel
other questions?
I've heard that RE4 is less of a horror game than the others.
Socks: it is
I've been thinking of getting it after November as my NaNoWriMo completion presant.
50k words in one month?
Yep
Ahh, NaNoWriMo... will be my 3rd time this year.
Took me 4 weeks to write 20k
LunasGuard: that's actually show worthy :D
DerpyMuffins, clearly you haven't heard of shortskirtsandexplosions
It'll be my second attempt, hopfully I'll finish this year :P
I've written the 50k in five days last year. That was... really not advised. Socks, do not do that. XD
I had a terrible time of getting to sleep last night :S
/me bows to GilDash as a superior being
is it that quiet or is my connection being slow as usual?
GilDash! <3
Yeah i think i start with RE4. I was thinking about SH2, but since not only there's dark outside but there's also a thick fog, and i don't have a spare pair of pants...
Socks: Umm... no need for that. As long as you keep a steady word pace NaNo is a cakewalk.
AJIsAwesome: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/fd2a18ed2d7a368f0203cb8b274840d0.png mmm, apples
bah, connection
MadSurge: Holla! :)

I have a netbook which I use for school but it can just about run this stream and very little else.
i came home and what did i see......"pinkie pie watches paint dry"......i was like HEY PINKIE why waste all that time...it would be like a "hostile takeover" if you dont come and "meet the team" she didnt argue..i wish we could just argue and everyone would yell RAP RAP RAP and it would be "epic rap battles of equestria" i then knocked her out and gave her a "punishment" then i said you better clean all that drool on the floor or els
Socks: atleast it can run doom
ASoftFluffyThing: nah im just playing.
ASoftFluffyThing: whats your id?

16GB RAM, 500GB hard drive
How long have they been going at this wave now?
My want
what game is streaming?
Mega_Milk, just loling
Team Fortress 2.
Also, accepted
8gb ram, 1.5TB
my want
Chubba and the game mode is Mann vs Machine
cool
ASoftFluffyThing :3
Ohai chubba :)
i wonder if anyone would be exited if there was going to be a team fortress 3
Haven'te been here in months.
nope
Nah
Nah, I'm fine with just TF2.
/me coughs
CRASHED
There are people in here?!
Team Fortress 3? sounds dissapointing
We don't need a TF3.
Socks: as long as they don't fail...
apparently
No....<_<
nope
>_>
<_<
Valve can't count to three anyway
There is that one Valve game that ends with number 3 that we want.
last thing team fortress needs is a trilogy
AJIsAwesome: We just need more hats and more updates
Stonegaze: ricochet?
Yeah i'm content with TF2 as it is.
AJIsAwesome: TF2 is the nicest FPS multiplayer game I've seen.
DED
Valve have said that there will never be a TF3 they're just going to keep updating TF2
No Balls-E for the TF2 stream!
Who needs sequels when you can have hats, anyway?
No one here >_><_<
^
i am kicking ass!
Socks: that's great :)
Which is good, it's pretty much perfect.
But srsly; leave annual sequels to other titles.
SirGanjalf: TF3 will just be the hats fighting
I miss my PC.
Good to know, I'll just go back to sleep then...

"Could not invite this friend. Your friend's limit is exceeded." I get this message whenever I try to send an invite. Is there anything I can do to fix this problem?

IF the bomb is deployed to the hatch, all is lost.
So what does the FaN do for the Scout?
Well, this has been fun, but I must away!

let's just say that, with the free to play with buyable contend type of game, the only way for them to make money is to shit out a new game and pray to god (and honestly, thats what they are doing) that people are stupid enough to buy stuff

One's One True Pairing is the pairing that one supports above all others, often to the point of fanaticism.
Whoa, a little fast, there, Allegr0 :3

I gotta say though, i think RAVING FURIOUS SEX is in the running for the next Best Meme for the next Tom Awards
^
can we have ponies?
Or the G3 Live Show
OR G4
lmao
If you ask for ponies, you will get something depending on the streamer. It will either be Newborn cuties, or Seaponies
and if not, then fuck it, ill make a regulars annual awards thingy
Also "In this segment the Buddha" too, can't forget that. :D
i like seaponies
NEVER ASK FOR PONIES. SERIOUSLY.
Allegr0: if only i knew how to stream
Never ask for ponies, EVER

Srsly.
Bitches dont know about the Allcaps rule

PPPP pixel perfect pony podcast!
Only time I asked for ponies was on the 2nd Anniversary, cause it would have been fitting to show one that day (Someone eventually did late that night)
Polydunami: Only if people spam it to death.
No, even as a phrase.
Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie you never called us your motherfucking pixels
Assimilation with Bro State? That's not a bad thing IMO.
J_E_Smith71: we havent had a second anniversary you liar
What have I walked into?
0,14>.>
When asking for ponies, specify, say sea ponies

Ugh, this chat is such a mess...
Honestly, I kind of prefer the "In this segment" meme better.

Oh whatever, we're overloaded on new pony episodes ALL the time anyway.
inb4 someone asks for ponies :P
Funnily enough, yeah, we go flooded every new episode.
Title on eqnic.net: Equestria NIC
^ :d
04Seth stopped promoting our movie nights because the season was over
*^^
can we have seaponies?
Polydunami: didnt we have like 2k people on the finale anyway
Now, the buffer show :3
Yeah we did :D
I hate fan self-wanking, but this is the nicest fandom I've been into :3
Lil_B: no, not really, its just that sometimes I get brainfarts and make the most amateurish grammatical mistakes...
twilight_sprinkle: 6k
04But not that we have the new season on the way I imagine he'll be promoting us quite a bit
04*now
I remember BronyState used to post BMN, that's how I found this place.
Night Everypony
bye TheLazyGrizzly
I found this place by way of the derpy chat reaction video.
Lol the finale was epic on BS
night, TheLazyGrizzly. :)
it might become 20k, if the system can take it
Right away, too.
nite TheLazyGrizzly
Alchemist xD I know, I was just making a joke, when the English went out the winmdow, than I hope it doesn't break :P
Ghosties: Course you have people on YouTube like swainize and TroIIestia sort of promoting the site with their reaction vids
04Yep, those guys too
I found this site by Ballad Of The Brony.
The stream IS buffering for you guys, right?
andyway I'll say goodbye for now too
Stormman3100: YeP> :)
It's over, Stormman3100
For now
Bye, Lil_B. :)
Bye Lil_B.

04I really hope there's gonna be people posting reaction vids on YouTube and promoting us on there as well
Good night Lil_B!
Oh.
Stormman3100: they shut down
bye Lil_B
See you, Lil_B
i just saw it on equestria daily and decided to check the place out
Bye Lil_B :)
cya Lil_B:)
Cya Lil_B
I remember the live premieres of S2 episodes on those Saturday mornings.
bye Lil_B
I'm pretty sure swainize will post new videos.
when the new season starts, people will ask for live streams everywhere
I'd have the stream open on my laptop and watching it in the middle of class
h's still here. watch him soak up our attention^^
Ghosties: Well TroIIestia still has "See you in Season 3" on the top of his channel so I think he'll continue
/me hugs AJIsAwesome Kinixys Alchemist DaringDerpy Polydunami thelonepony scout19_tf2 DerpyMuffins and Dark_Horst <3
Polydunami: yeah, that's what I thought too
04Hmm, should maybe contact him
When season 3 premiers. OH IT WILL BE CHAOS! It will be chaos!
I hope the stream doesn't crash. e~e
It has crashed before
Inb4 shit storm
Ponies47: insert flailing Applebloom here
Ponies47: the best chaos. :$
Dark_Horst I never can catch up with the names, even worse whern I screw up and have to tyxpe it again :P
As much chaos as when Derpy spoke for the first time?
AJIsAwesome: Exactly
id watch the premiere on tv, but i dont have the hub..or a tv..
I seriously wish I was here for that. :D
speaking derpy was strange...like "was this just real?"
I won't be in chat when I watch the stream. Right afterwards, yep!
Stormman3100: probably. but during THE WHOLE EPSIDOE!
I think stream nearly crash because of Derpy
and fuck my typing
I'd do chat reactions, but I can't. A. I can't record sound on this computer (Only when I'm at my mother's) and B. Sometimes I get lag and buffers depending on my internet connection
lets talk about the tough choices in life, like: alcohol or internet.
04Internet
I wasn't a brony yet when that happened apparently. I came in at about episode 23 of S2...
Internet
I'm going to go now. G'night to you all and and have fun freaking out over Season 3.
Actually, this website has been attacked on airdates before.
or, Pistachios, or a hot bath
Night Stonegaze
Internet. Never had alcohol.
i saw a screenshot from the location of the premiere. i get e feeling it will be very fucking epic
Night Stonegaze :)
Lyra` why not both
Alcohol
Lyra`: don't drink so much
Hi guys :)

DerpyMuffins has his prioritys in order, and i like that ;D

BRB shower
Sorry for my tyops.
/me ahem
Hello guys! :)
I was here before the site was attacked I think
flutterchu lol
Hi sonicdude558 :)
alright, how about: would you rather eat pizza found in the garbage, or walk thru an open sewer
Polydunami: Yeah if you were in the chat long before the attack you were okay
Hi sonicdude558
open sewer lol
Course the attack screwed up the stream for a little bit
I remember that
Lyra`: neither. :D
J_E_Smith71: 1/1/12?
I'd walk through the sewer
What's an open sewer?
I think I lost my keys there
think of a creek
but with human waste instead
TMNT?
AH
WAIT
Just wondering, how many people are wearing their Brony bracelets right now?

/me glomps twilight_sprinkle

DaringDerpy: that could work
/me steals DaringDerpy's labcoat
/me kidnaps DaringDerpy for science
AJIsAwesome: Yep. Whole site was down for those who weren't in the chat already
I will get some Derpy neck ties and wear those instead.
AJIsAwesome: Also messed up the stream for a little bit
Stop right there, Bronystate Kidnapper!
:(
I have a Derpy Polo.
AJIsAwesome: Where get?
Bronystate needs its own MMO... That would be bad ass. xD
Yes, I'm talking to you, alexxm
Kinixys: Hot Topic. :)
AJIsAwesome: O
there is an mmo in development, Stormman3100
Tell me when a stream comes on :)

aw how come ASoftFluffyThung
Stormman3100: That would be hilarious and awesome at the same time. :D
new bath boyhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJGRbNxW2-M
sonicdude558: Sure. :D
alexxm, because kidnapping is bad, mmkay?
equestria online was the old name...don't know how they call it now
DaringDerpy: Are you serious?!?! :O
really since when ASoftFluffyThing
alexxm, since forever?
Wait. a bronystate mmo, DaringDerpy?
Stormman3100: http://www.legendsofequestria.com/
Who here likes Rainbow Road? :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1E8FXpH3Es&feature=relmfu

bronystate could surely occupy a village there
Would you eat skittos if RD poops them out?
theres another one too caled MLP Online
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJGRbNxW2-M
and enslave the world
DerpyMuffins: Nope.gif
Yeah, how about a bronystate village? :D
I mean, we'd all be ponies :P
Polydunami or we could invade the polish village of brony
J_E_Smith71: I actually haven't. What did they attack with? :S
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx1x5LTjUFM
brony, lodz. population 80. we might win
Wait Ponyville doesn't have electricity, but there is a hydro dam?
AJIsAwesome: Well first thing here's the reaction vid. A couple times during the start of the episode the stream goes out because of the attack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gazb4gpGleA
DerpyMuffins: water supply?
J_E_Smith71: 4chan attack?
AJIsAwesome: But I believe it was a hacking attempt. One of the mods would know the full story
Makes sense
hello everypony
J_E_Smith71: ah, okay.

Polydunami: Nice!
Polydunami: Cool!

moved to portland, Bronysith
But it was still fun. Although it was during the intense summer heat. Also, people were getting ready for the olympic games.
Stormman31000: I know that feeling. :D

ASoftFluffyThing: Of course, jokes are supposed to be funny. :P
Stormman31000, I know that feel. I deem anything more than basic math from Math Hell.

Stormman31000, you like the science part of math
Rain: oh, sorry, well anyways, it sucks that you had to leave your friends and such behind, but there is many modes of transportation and such. Skype is a wonderful thing as well. I know what its like when all the friends move away being left alone, but i know ill see them again and thats what keeps me going
