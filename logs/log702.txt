00,10end up liveing in a mud hut at the base of a huge indistrial processor
i'm pretty sure everyone would be fine sitting around playing drinking games though
No drugs except ponies?
I'm on a drug called Pinkie Pie
?
alcohol dude ofc
Something that GIVES intelligence, not taking it away
but this isn't just for my friends, i'd be holding it at the guesthouse which has about 200 people in it
i'm not doing pony drinks
Oh, I know. But it tastes and looks great.
i think i have that same list on how to mix drinks hahaha
My favourite colour is the rainbow.
I do like that colour.
It looks great.
otherwise i'll have people bring their own alcohol because i'm too poor to pay for anyone but myself

stuff;'

these are all language students
from allll over the world :D
Well, learn Latin and show them who's boss.

No I mean for activity
i'm calling hax
oh
i think i should just stick with alcohol and mix up how it's taken
Kids nowadays with their alcohole
;_;
yeah whatever
And not "Party for the party"
alcohol is a social lubricant
it brings people together and makes the mood way more fun
couldn't*
Some would even say it doubles the fun.
i really would rather have a lot of alcohol then just have people stand around not do anything
doing*
I would rather have no Alcohole and havef un :P
alcohol makes everything fun
besides if you don't want to drink you don't have to

But The Next One Is Announced! I Cant Wait <3
http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=l_0U5KDFd_o&feature=endscreen
They are releasing Blazblue more frequently then Capcom
sort of getting annoying
so....the only thing different in this one is.....new characters?
And Adding To The Story
ElloEllo
To be honest.......
they could put that has Expansion Pack or DLC
Not to mention the most effective startegy is push every button at an extremely fast pace.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GjVy2pMZiY&feature=relmfu
Well that Doesnt Work in BB
Lincoln for President http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
You Could Understand That The Controls in Blazblue make it more interesting Then other Games Do
You really won't get far
trust me
Not Far At All
to give an extremely unpopular opinion....don't hurt me...I think both candidates would be decent presidents

Its Not About Hateing Fighting Games though is It. Its About Being An Ignorant Nutball Because Of That Opinion. Right? I Don't Personally Mind One Way or The Other If You Don't Like Them.
I was not being an "Ignorant Nutball".
Ahh, But That Is My Opinion, Isnt It? ^_^
I don't really like fighting games, but I see how passionate fans are. Stop hating!

11,01Hi.

11,01*up
And I usually don't mind. But on this place it really angers me.
No BF3
My approach to people calling me names is usually agreeing.

/me is going to use a costom mvm popfile

11,01Because people have to make money.

:( hugs?
I am not a hugging man.

*hugs joshi222*

Hugs are for everyone
For people of all ages
But it makes you Bubbuly if you give hugs :3
Then again, my social knowledge is limited to "tie them to a chair and show films."
Well I'm bck
Back

If you think about it, a hug IS pretty boring.
Regardless, I should probably get back to my essay.

O.o
>_> He's gone...Post humans
And then 20 monsters spawn and kill him
If there was multiplayer, Goldeneye 007 would of been a joke...no offense.
I liked Goldeneye 007 too.
Saturn afk?
if doom 64 had multiplayer then goldeneye 007 would just be another obscure gem
Saturnis
Saturn is streaming.
Ikr
I figured. I hear an accent, but it didn't sound like Wre-k's.
usually he's running around with 1% to 15%

Saturn don't just Leeroy Jenkins it
Chainsaws <3.
I like using nomes as verbs or Adjectives xD
!cd
I can hear doom but cant see it
Did I tell you about me and my buddy Keth played some doom?
does someone else get Stuttering?
I do
People spam spam when they saw Derpy the first time
Is Saturn playing Doom? XD
I just hear studdering
yeah
likewise Derpy
People are talking about the room! Hide the booze!

Saturn haven't you clopped enough today????
Saturn: stop clopping!
........

But I dont get why it was downgraded as much as it was.

No booze here >_><_<
/me drinks all the beer
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Why are we talking about the regulars room? :<
brb
I don't even drink beer ._.
Ok maybe I've had a sip or to...
wait brb
:D
Adults were around!
!
Gimme a break
he said ok just a sip
IT TASTES LIKE URINE
:D
It does have a rather strange taste.
I prefer whiskey, anyway.
Mass Effect 4 is really a money grab
i wouldnt buy it
Frog off?
I don't see Mass Effect 4 having anything to do with Mass Effect 3 anyway
wine is fine
brb = be right back?
i havent tasted wine but my brother has
he is 10
Hopefully.
GODDAMMIT
This happened because they chose to do this.
haha
brb = be right back?! ;-;
And I think the company's creators finally got sick of it.
.....
:3
KOTOR is good....for its time.
:D
:O
Perhaps my biggest issue with TOR is that it feels like "KOTOR the MMO".
AJIsAwesomeIsTequila
:D
I have a link to Mass Effect 4 being confirmed
My biggest issue with TOR is that I can't kill enough people by choking them.
I think Ubisoft nailed the E3 conference with the annoucement of Rayman Legends, with Nintendo's in second with Pikmin 3's anoucement.
Or electrocuting hem.
them*
^
Nintendo's conference was bad, Microsoft's was bad, Sony's was meh but the Book thing was horrible
and i think beer tastes like urine
E3 was generally bad this year.
Sony's conference was *not* "meh".
It was AWFUL.
everything is terrible
Seriously...FUCKING. BOOKS.
11,01At least the press conferences aren't.
O.o
hello everypony
Wait, no... That was last year.
Wonderbook?
last time*
Everything else was a rehash of something we already knew about, or a remake, etc.
Mine is somwhat long.
*somewhat
haha
ripoffs
Sony's conference SUCKED.
Lol
It sucked hard.
11,01CriticKitten: Bad world economy has devs and publishers turning to remakes and sequels to stay alive.
There was literally no redeeming features to it. Reboots, rehashes, re-everything.
11,01I don't expect to see innovation from AAA gaming anytime soon.
11,01Exactly.
that's good shit
This nick is just silleh :P
Which is sad, because they put forth a lot of remakes too.
they wont announce it
...I saw the show on 4chan.
even if they ever make it
theyll just drop it
Then I downloaded the entirety of S1 in 720p and watched it.
I think the last time they "lost" was their presentation of the Wii, but they got the last laugh there, too
they announced the wiiu ffs
Last year they presented Wii U.
exactly
This year was just them expanding on it.
Er, not really.
the wiiu is the only console to suck more than the wii
The Wii U fixes every problem the Wii had.
Literally every one.
Saturn yup
We can see it, Saturn.
yes Saturn
yep
11,01I expect E3 2013 to be sequels and motion controls just like 2012.
And yes, i'm buying the Wii U because of Pikmin 3 and Rayman.
Then i googles 'mlp fans', found EqD, and found Bstate from there :)
Saturn: Yeah, but there's a sound/video de-sync.
*googled
hi guys :)
My family doesn't really give a damn.
Introducing the Playstation 3.5.
and I'Äm back xD
My family doesn't mind either.
Wii U fixes a lot of the problems Wii had. I can't imagine how anyone looks at that and says "they lost E3 because of this" unless they're just not seeing clearly.
I told my mum I was going to order a purple necklace with an icon from a cartoon originally aimed at little girls, and she just say "oh, 'kay".
just said*
b-b-but nintenyearolds are just waggle babies

Lol

11,02Hai :3/
But they are nailing a lot of decent exclusives as well.
And Ubi is in their back pocket.

11,02Moo :3
:D
You could just tell her its from a show. Nothing more. :)
or Call of Duty 5
:D
Did they ever make Call of Duty 5?
my grandma doesnt give a shit
WAW was Cod 5
11,02Black Ops II is Call of Duty 9
I still need to find a gosh darned Applejack.
At all.
Yaaaay, You won! NOW DIE
*video
I'm holding out on Wii U until the Zelda title.
Yeah :P
E3 2013, calling it now.
2
It looks great.
In HD.

Saturn: Play Dune 2 :P
I just wish I had the money to make Steampunk outfits and such...
11,02DerpyMuffins: Yesh
The Legend of Zelda: Modern Warfare
Same.
11,02Lil_B: I knew about it before :)
Everyone is mocking Nintendoland now.....
hey guys
I'll go ahead and make another prediction: it'll be the top selling Wii U title.
Or at least in the top ten.
the Gameboy came out at their 100th annivbersary
Why? Because look at the top titles on the Wii.
Thats Japanese commitment
120years*
I want a plushie ;A;
^
Hello everypony
pinkie pie saves everyone
Lol :D
All of my shirts are from WeLoveFine
Dat "couple more"
The scrooge in me wont allow it
its as bad as playstation home
200 dollars for a plushie is fucking expensive
if not worse
because they didnt learn from sony's mistakes
I also have a Derpy mousepad :3
Jelly?
redbubble accepts debit card?
:3
Always that "Couple more" :D
mita: You think every single copy of Wii Sports is a console sale, then?
Title on twitter.com: Twitter
Play Dune 2 :P
title on twitter: twitter lol
cya
mita: Because that would be impossible. The Wii has sold more units than Wii Sports. :P
I havent seen him recently, but yeah...
Hey guys
Hi Saturn
Saturn: Does that say "Chocolate Doom is free"
People come and go :'(

Never knew that.

11,01Thought it was publishers?

08,01this is the OST from Mask of the Phantasm
Way to go.
^^^^^^
But over time, I managed to learn how things went here, and I quickly adapted.
^^^^^
Isn't it from the animated series?
i think i joined april 5 or 6
klrpwny73
When I first came here, i was sorta... spastic, to say the least
D:
wasnt until dari banned me that i became tame
Hey guys.
I'm still a little spastic.
I think I need to turn my ping off
It seems all heros are orphans
You cards winner ,you ;)

that music reminds me of star wars
:D
08,01is the stream still working?

She doesnt have parents
YOu mean one season?

I have a crap load of pony quotes stored on my computer
Wish Superman had awesome music like this

08,01Rex_Mundi: i'd get that tattoo
Has Kung Pow ever been aired here?

I hated the trip after day 3, i think.
Hai Rain , how you doing?
Oh wow
Yeah, I remember being away from family for an extended period of time.

I was in China for a couple of weeks four years ago.
3 inches from my current location and back
I went to Japan for a week, but that's because I LIKE Japan.
Beijing, Xi-an, Shanghai with an overnight trip to Suzhou.
I went to China once
It was part of a school trip; I'd been saving up for that entire year.
Saw the great wall

She is?
Oh yeah, I actually traversed the Great watt
