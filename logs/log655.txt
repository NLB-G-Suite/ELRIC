you mean worst.
fluttershy is my least favorite pony of the entire show
and this song is familiar..
Trixie is the worst pony in the entire show, but RD is worst mane 6.
If i had to vote, i'd vote for RD, casue she had many douchebag moments in last season
RD can be cocky, but she usually catches herself and stop

I never said anything about grub
or mint4win
O.o
lol
I only said GRUB is slow
dat derpy
Oh god...this was years ago and this isnt even mine origionaly.. let me see...
03GRUB isn't slow o.o
03GRUB2 is just a bloated pile of crap
Uh how
03and if it's something like Ubuntu, when you upgrade it, you can tell it to keep the older GRUB
I think 3 years...I dont really recall
lol this is hilarious :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OviK2FWFom0&feature=g-u-u
Laptop
Three years? Oh, that's just middle age in computer tERMS> Don't sweat it.
I said I think 3 years I really dont remember how long I had this thing
It has a really low Window's Index rating
...Canadian Stereotype.
Maybe they'll finish at 3
a 3.1
if there is a season 4
lol
dari implying theres a 3
Why are you installing it any way?
I just want to see the reactions when FiM ends
Implying it won't
I think I had this since 2009, I'm just guessing here
because a coin flip told me to
We'll see...
65 episodes and a feature length film.
I liked the first WTF Collective, not the second one
/me hands you Harvey Dent's coin
Finished.
actually drf
Yes, of course
Beautiful
if it was harvey dent's coin
Lazy :P
I'm going to take a shower... I'll be back in a few
it would have been heads
Hey everyone
And then delicious tears time?
How are we all today? :)
>implying I care if it finishes
I'm pretty sure the highest they'll go is season 4. If they make any later seasons, that'd be great.
?
YUS
yes
Pfft
dat spike
It's going to end sometime
oh twilight
Bullshit
i think theyll make nore than 4 just because of the fandom
Same with my school
Some 3 minute shorts that took months?
o.o
They're not going to have time to make full episodes
well my technical reporting teacher puts docx files on blackboard
Oh, she lost her trumpet
Not unless they quit their jobs
And we fund them all
Pay their salary
that libreoffice has no idea how to show correctly
She found it
I would
Ouch
weell this is.....strange
Besides, if fans were to continue the show, it would get old and stale.

Whos up for season 3:)
me!
with wine or virtualbox you can
00,03Me.... maybe
>Implying every OC is bad
anyway i got to bbl
Yeah, I'mma gonna focus on Rarity and her mad golfing skills.
2,14 if used in a fanshow? yes, it is
Lol
oh let me show you my OC
apparently some relatives are just giving away a laptop to me
and i need to go pick it up
/me hates OC elitism.
Again implying every OC is bad
heres my OC http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo86/kyuubi_yura/ponyart_ed.jpg
not really
00,10did I come back to drama?
the software I use can't be ruin with Wine
I just REALLY want to hear Fluttershy's complaints about the dress Rarity made for her in a results section of this.
or Virtualbox
I gues you did
If I felt the fanmade "episode" was quality, I'd show it.
its too demanding in terms of CPU clock cycles
O U
Do ho ho
That had good quality
Um, no.
cx
There are roads that a pony must pony.
please note, I said can
No, it really can't
Depends how many people work on it
00,03besides, I already saw parts of DRB, it was eh~
but can fans make full episodes with good animation, good writing and to keep the characters personalities in check? i doubt it
03well that sucked
^
03and since it's tile
SUUUUPPPAAAAAAAAAA
03I was walking to the bathroom and slipped on it
03banged up my knee
03fricking limping now

It's odd. CG's openings kind of went downhill. COLOURS was awesome. R2's first opening was acceptable, and grew on you. R2's second opening...I just can't like it.
DAMMIT

stupid myans
Anyway, bedtime f'r me. Got work tomorrow.
'night.
good afternoon everyone ^_^
Hope the idiots don't riot too hard
*Hi
ugh did it wrong v.v
you guys remember the may 21st raptures.... its all coming back to me now
Is there no other reason besides people being fucking morons when they "assumed" the end of the calendar was doomsday
even the myans are sick and tried of this whole end of the world thing.... the calender was written eons ago, back in a time we thought the world was flat and earth was the center of the universe.
Of all the conclusions they could have drawn and its doomsday
Why is humanity plauged with retards
...
I listened
Go Derpy!
i'm gonna brb everypony

SPIKE :O
DAT LASS
:P
DIE SPIKE DIE
I saw this one thing on tv that said some philosipher, I forget his name, predicted several things in our time and a supposed" dooms day"
Spike getting pumped. Awwww.
Go AppleJack!
lol
yum
Next is Twilight.
you know, everyone is an awful friend to twilight except Applejack really
00,10wonder if spike evloves in to macho spike
:D
00,10or just spike with stash
back
theyre like zubat arent they
Then there was some bullshit about dooms day being predicted in some Islam manuscript or something
They apologized to her offscreen I think, but yeah you have a point.
Whoa, it's Snails.
Oh duuuude.
Snails. :O
That is why Applejack is Twilights only nice friend
wrap up*
darnit
All of our reasoning is faulty.
i wish i had one of those things now
Still annoyed no one apologized to twilight after the wedding fiasco
I like to know a bit or two about our local religious groups. Really, after over a dozen years being drowned in Catholicism, you start to welcome the quirks and interesting bits about other religions.
ok... I'm back everypony
Spades, AppleJack did.
13ded ded

It's Spike!

Doubel negative, means we're alive.

Actually, I was more upset that her own brother didnt apologize to her.
00,10chhchickenCX, gonna head you off there. Dont go leading in to things taht might be spoilers
dat song
...NOOOOOOOO
fuck if theres anyone apoligzing its everyone involved in that wedding
oh no
Wait. Dat Miku? o_o
I guess thats one reason why I like Twilight, because the rest of her "friends" can be real jerks sometimes
I just gave the title and i didnt mean to it was on wiki but i dont know if its right.
Sorry
I want one of those too
no no
Is this some sort of Vocaloid version of Carameldansen?
ya ther's no pinkie pie lrft in that move!

There is the issue that people bring their own bias into reasoning.
>Element of honesty can tell if someone is lying, >Doesnt belive twilight during the wedding

These 2 girls laughed at my derpy drawing..
They dont lik eponies..

and then he went away
**extra
take a shot
Theres opinion and then theres plain stupidity
I'm back
i mean yeah people are morons, but everyone is a moron, usually when people say "people are stupid" they mean "people disgree with me"
lol the irony.
dis remix stinks
lol.
lol maybe that's where they got the idea?
Oh, I just contradicted myself.
wait it really is carmel
Really, ota, that entire bit was logically wrong.
I dont mind opinions but if their opinion is blatantly stupid then they're stupid
YES
It depends, if their opinion has a lot of good factual evidence then it's fine. But if it has no evidence then it's just dumb.
the remix just got 20% cooler

Ahhhhhh I see.
I never knew they produced the "safe" version of Project A-Ko

How about the titty twister
Gay Porn - One time - Never again

Just One Time?
Of course I didn't get it either until later on....
But that's beside the point, you still need to get it man

As in, I'm not understanding the joke
Is there any humour in this?
But have you ever get a titty twister dude?
How does not understanding something make sense?
cram it lumpy
Heh i did that to myself once it hurs

Idea: use the eagles to fly Frodo to Mount Doom, then let him fly out

Where I live, we call that sexual harassment.
Uh oh
Mordor its like los vegas eccept without the pyramids

Its complicated
Turst me you can
I guess it's possible...
No see i do the titty twister at myself i do it most of the time dude

I guess you could say that Frodo gave him the FINGER
SPARTA

He was just DYING to wear that wrong
Frodo can't give him a hand because he already gave a FINGER

"Okay, now that we are all here - how about 'n orgy?"
"No? Anyone?"

"My first act of business: legalize acid!"
