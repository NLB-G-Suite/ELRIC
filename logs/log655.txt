Anuswaffle
Oh ^^
6Wafflyanus
cri sa lis
Yes
Chrysalis is named after the chemical term
dafuq
its not a chemical term
its a bilogical term
6Glad we agree ^^
brb guys, got some work I need to finish
My worst enemy, i killed it and ate his blood
i never even heard anyone call luna chrysalis
And the buffer blood tasted good
Chrysalis: Close enough, I don't pay attention in Scienence
/me puts Chrysalis in a full nelson
I forgot exactly when in the S2 finale her name was given.
well, its another name for the cacoon that catapilllers use to turn to butterflys
Kandarihu|OldComp: After she transformed
Kandarihu|OldComp it wasn't
hence, changing and bug like queen being named chrysalis
I'll tell you why, HAX
HAAAAAAAx
Have any of you guys seen the fanart of chrysalis vs nightmare moon?
Here come the HAAACKS

Okay. I only have the episodes in HD, and my old comp can't handle that. So I'm going to have to wait until I get my mom's laptop back

CheesyLlama13: That depends. What are your friends like?
Kind and funny... when they're not lying about me

CheesyLlama13: They lie about you? They don't sound like good friends to me. :S
08,01Serenity: unicorn tears
Okay, where's the guns.
08,01i almost screamed when i saw what had happened to it
It's on the way to school, and it's only a few; they don't say things that are that bad really but it's just annoying
08,01Chrysalis: BUCK 2013, I can solve all your problems ;)
CheesyLlama13: I recommend that you have a personal talk to them, otherwise I fear it may go too far, IMO.
can't wait for 2013
i live in manchester now

isn't this a Naruto Opening?
2,14 meh, wrek and I have similar tastes
2,14 and no, this is Eureka 7
eureka 7 a show about surfing
no robots
surfing robots?
ValtheJean: ah the anime I dislike because 90% of the characters are dicks.
what the HELL was that show about
Chrysalis: and a crew of dicks
05PM
Chrysalis: apparently a kid growing up
2,14 you mean the show you don't like because you're a prick
so it's a hentai otakon
It is?
ValtheJean actually, i liked eureka 7
otakon: Imagine that, a full crew of dickshep and dickjensen
13val is val again
ValtheJean: no the show I don't like because everyone on that damn ship treated Renton lower than dog shit.
/me 13checks hell's temperature
hiya Shizuka
Hey, Shizuka
Everyone's entitled to their own opinions ^^
ohai Shizu :P
hai Shizuka
ohai Shizuka
2,14 which is a gross exaggeration
Serenity: yeah it's easy, the crew of the Gekko
Hi Shizuka.
13also my video on the SSTV file hiding in black mesa just went over 1k views
hi
how are things Shizuka
Nice.
Sweet
Shizuka: awesome I bet you were the first to find it is why
13in three days... it took my riven huts a full year to break 900...
going on youtube bye
bye Snowflake
Seeya
Guess people care more about Black Mesa than Riven. How surprising.
love yall

bye SNowflake
cya sno
bye!
Meanwhile of course
bye Sno...gone
i want ash( (i think that's the right name...?) to go to sugarcube corner :3
CheesyLlama13: Ash yes
Yay I remembered something for once~ :D
ValtheJean: so when does Scootaloo evolve into a chicken?
Must be soon...
2,14 implying this isn't my first playthrough of this game
So no one answered my question so I'll post it again.
GUYS! I HAVE A QUESTION! Should a game be counted on it's merits of single player gameplay over all else?
you dont have a savegame? ValtheJean
Michael: proabably multiple
08,01otakon: better idea, go outside and enjoy the real world
2,14 I installed it today for the stream
2,14 otherwise, I've never had it
:D
btw, are u using VBA?
2,14 god damn fucking bullshit crits
As you probably noticed, it's kinda dangerous around my district
otakon graphics outside are terrible
and down for the count
always raining
Chrysalis: but the bloom effects!
oh dear
buck bloom
buck godrays
Chrysalis: Outsides have got epic looking water reflections
Shizuka: Amen.
13only one shard, you get one character
and buck DoF
13permadeath
Shizuka no check points
2,14 WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THESE CRITS?
13you have to stop playing every 24 hours or you die, but you're expected to play forever
Not if you roll Hindu Shizu.
Sucks that according to my fortune teller, I' living to 53, then I get shot.
do it!
13but you don't get to pick your class
Nice future I have there
ponymon?
13your class is built from the other players on the server
yes TheMaster
how do you actually get black mesa on steam
Shizuka: You can't pick player name either
13you can change it later if you navigate the admin's stupidly complex rules
arte there really 150 ponies?
are there*
yes
I've got to go :'(
True, but don't you have to be a certain age?
151 i think
I'll see y'all later ^^
bye CheesyLlama13
byee
bye CheesyLlama13
Right
Some zambies want to kill me, so I'm gonna get some sleep and murder them
See ya tommorow if I don't get eaten
>Zombies want to kill you
>Go to sleep
Well that seems counter productive at best.
Night, Serenity :)
^ Yep
Shizuka: okay how about your view on this: A game should be able to stand on it's single player merits regardless of the multi-player added to it.
Gnight Serenity
night Serenity sleep well
whoose streaming
13i generally can't stand multiplayer
otakon are you STILL banging on about that?
13so yes
Rainbowdash90: Val is
otakon1 but what about games like tf2
Chrysalis: don't count since they are nothing but MP
Chrysalis: I'm talking stuff like mass effect 3 or Cod titles
stuff with MP and SP modes
Gnight y'all

hello everyone
hi derp_derp :)
how are you derp_derp
so this games free?
yes
looks fun
THIS IS EVERYTHING
hey guys ^^
hey
how are things Litwick
hi Litwick
MY CELESTIA THIS IS AMAZING
Doing well Alex.
hey everypony
why is he only staying in one spot
how are things Pearly
hi Pearly :)
hey
Ihop1: He's level grinding.
2,14 Ihop1: first rule of pokemon: train your starters and first catches to level 10
Lyra
2,14 otherwise the world hurts you
Bitch please
ValtheJean: i never bothered with it and i beat the games easily
Only use your first pokemon till it's level 100
guys
And never use anything else
help me.
And win the game
:P
Hey alexxm and AJIsAwesome, how are you dears doing?
im reading homestuck and cant sto[p
With what?
2,14 that's the boring 4 year old way to play
i'm good Pearly yuo
Lul
I hate when the phone rings and I can't find it and it stops ringing the second I find it -__-
Pearly: Good. How about you? :)
it is a fast way though
plus
It was probably Gen
I'm sure Val would love to slap the shit out of you for that Litwick
i dont see the point of leveling pokemon you can catch later at 40 anyway
Why? Val hates Homestuck?
Meh, it's his opinion.
I am good, had my surgery and it went well... just my hand and elbow is bandaged
2,14 because if you catch them at early levels their EVs aren't at 0 when they're 40
if you catch them early they have better stat progression then if you catch the later
Five.
the game, like all jrpgs, rewards grinding
Pearly: What surgery?
ValtheJean: i forget whats EV? some stat from leveling? i mean its not reeally important for the games that didnt have multiplayer, since the stats arent needed that much to beat the game anyway
08,01a pair of my friends just broke up their engagement :(
:O
08,01which really sucked, because they were an adorable couple
2,14 every time you beat a pokemon, it rewards an EV of a certain stat
I had carpal and cubital tunnel release surgery
08,01but on the plus side... the guy is really fucking hot... but straight
2,14 4 EVs of one type equate to 1 actual stat by level 100
08,01but now i don't feel bad about hitting on him when i see him next!
08,01oh wait, right, boyfriend...
Oh you. :P
really, a post-engagement rebound?
lol
ValtheJean: so you can get a godlike pokemon just by beating a billion level 3's?
08,01still, a bit of harmless flirting is fine
10Gasmic curly fries
13http://i.imgur.com/cdNOO.jpg

GilDash: I can see how it can be used, but I dont maintain contact with that many people. I have an email for those who I dont call friends just collegues/else and I have a phone number for my friends. I dont need more.
08,01actually, come to think of it, i hhave friends who work at facebook, google, and microsoft
the possibilitys
08,01when i graduate, i should pester them to put in a good word for me

So, mod peoples, mind if you pop into #this so i can ask somethings?

Litwick: there are more types than that. the cm for example are light types
*cmc
cool, so which beats which?
colgate is a different type than the rest but i can't remember which one...
yet for some reason, applebloom always seems to be beating the snot out of sweetie belle
so would dark types be stuff like diamond tiara?
weeping_pegasi82: Element of hygiene?
ah neat caramel got a bon bon

"Tough BRONIES" Oh jeez that made me laugh.
Pfft, Fluttershy is second worst mane 6.
you mean worst.
Meanwhile: cant imagine it to begin with
twilight_sprinkle: Nah I hold RD as worst.
Meanwhile: I can agree with this
wonder if twilight will have her adorkable dance or mustache spell as moves lol
fluttershy is my least favorite pony of the entire show
Sketch_Toku_Brony: I'd like to see the dance.
and this song is familiar..
so is this a real thing, or am i just halucinating?
Trixie is the worst pony in the entire show, but RD is worst mane 6.
If i had to vote, i'd vote for RD, casue she had many douchebag moments in last season
ok vinylscratch and octavia are the fossil ponymon which one should I get
RD can be cocky, but she usually catches herself and stop

musta come off the branch I walked into outside xx

I hate anime...
super stick people

im going for a very enthusiastic walk through the woods

TheRandomKid321: may I ask why?
CLAMP's art amuses me.
lol AJIsAwesome :D
Reikim|Crowbar: pretty sure, super elongated bodies with no room for organs
13those are houndeyes
oh
^oh right
Well I find Houndeyes cute
that old guy in the second city who wants to teach you how to catch things? dont talk to him. there wondt be a checkbox, and your game wil freeze
otakon: Actually, yes, it was! CLAMP did the designs for Code Geass. But not the mecha designs, which is my personal favourite part of the anime.
at least the little noises they make
thing is, now i cant move anymore and start over
and the acid spitting alligators(?) are bullsquids
Also: COLOURS. One of the best openings of all time. NO EXCEPTIONS.
weeping_pegasi82 I have seen what it can do to people. I aint turning into one of those freaks alright?
Reikim|Crowbar: ikr
Reikim|Crowbar: and the mecha are unneeded in it if you ask me
huh huh, "bullsquid":P
Reikim|Crowbar: its only fitting that thte best anime anime gets the best opening :P
Reikim|Crowbar: ahem TTGL would like a word with you
http://derpibooru.org/72356?scope=scpe830f48deeccc495532ee5c58d054b34233cd763f
TheRandomkid321: hey I have no problem with that
otakon: Sure they're not needed. But they're bloody awesome and if you disagree the Lancelot will cleave you in half.
maybe
but he's a 2D figure and I'm not
:P
ello everypony :)
otakon: Saying the mecha aren't necessary is like saying the mecha in TTGL aren't necessary. Try saying that to Simon's face.
I don't wish to turn into one of those people who's life revolves around anime and wear anime costumes around. Okay. End of story.
otakon: what if you are, but you just think youre in 3d?
Reikim|Crowbar: now THAT is a different story since the mecha of TTGL is a major plot element
TheRandomkid321: If you do it's only your fault.
so who is treaming ponymon?
streaming*
Reikim|Crowbar: unlike the unnecessary "Knightmare" of CG
I love seeing them bounce at high speeds.
00,10aw how cute, colt bigmac
I know >< horrible
I had a friend who got so obsessed with anime he changed.
otakon: the mecha technology of britannia was what gave them the chance to attack the world
dat scootaloo <3
otakon: The mecha of Code Geass are also important. The Holy Brittanian Empire could not have existed sans Knightmare Frames. And if you look at it a certain way, TTGL could have worked without mecha. You could have replaced them with personal power and the story would have worked.

Dark_Horst... Lol
/me wonders if the three legendary birds will be Celestia, Luna, and Cadence

It'll take forever to finish this torrent.
pepole seem to be ruining everyones game today
Dark_Horst: it's an alpha give it a break

ValtheJean: which version do you have?
Big Mac just kicked Applebloom. What a game.

soo much violence :( the poor ponies
weeping_pegasi82: What?
Zecora can use Scary Face

Everlasting_Joy: Big Mac beatin' those eggs like he beats applebloom *thats from epic pie time*
it just makes sense
^
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oi.
and RD can use Dash what a surprise
well, must be an older version
And seapony Lyra wants to see what's going on.
the latest, 0.32, has rainbow, pinkie and twilight as starters
Using Dash, while providing a temporary increase in combat abilities, is extremely dangerous and could easily result in fatality.
i hope Fancy Pants is a legendary in this lol
Don't do Dash, kids.
have you thought about pokemon this way?
00,10new version it has both ponyville and veredian forest
Sketch_Toku_Brony: That.

Obsidian: and that's Scootaloo
Torchic
Torscootaloo
the text gets all slightly blurry and boldy for a few seconds then turns clear and crisp for a few seconds and so forward

twilight_sprinkle: Yep. :P
Counting your starter, you could only get 4 or 5 pokemon before the first gym, and that's in the remakes
Carrot top!
In the original it was 3
2,14 Spearow, Pidgey, Rattata, the Bugs, Pikachu and the nidorans
2,14 I think a "Bitch please" is in order

00,03dragonforce?
i have some stuff to set on fire
i must set stuff on fire or the voices go crazy
My stream isn't showing
NOW IT DOES!
SPearow can't be gotten til after you get the first gym badg,e, as where you can catch it is blocked by that douche who wants you to do the first gym, you can only get the nidos of a certain gender, and pikachu wasn't in viridian forest in the originals
Bronysith: set the voices on fire
2,14 false
hai guys
/me sets twilight_sprinkle on fire
I NEED THIS GAME
done
2,14 Spearow is in the place to the left of the pokecenter
2,14 before your rival battle
WANT IT, NEED IT
hi ShiningDawn
/me hugs Bronysith and ignites him
I always got Spearow before the first gym.
twilight_sprinkle: i have a flame retardant suit dumbass
Why? Fearow is a badass bird of prey, what more do you want?
Going to the path to the Elite Four doesn't count...
hey ShiningDawn
/me Sets Bronysith on fire
How?
How does it not count, Edd?
2,14 uh, yes it does
Bronysith: i made a hole in it while i was hugging you
Ponies47: what part of flame retardant suit do you not understand
You can get there before first gym.
2,14 why else do they throw in a level appropriate encounter?
Hell, I got myself a Mankey there.
twilight_sprinkle: you cant, cause i have the force
BOOOOOOOO Diamond Tiara
Eddmario: Spearow, Nidoran M/F, Mankey, Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle, and Pikachu are what you can get before the first badge
Bronysith: but so do i
Yeah, that's where I got my Mankey.
twilight_sprinkle: nope
Bronysith: yep
um
is DT crying?
twilight_sprinkle: you are now thinking about naked otakon

die diamond tiara!
and pikachu wasn't in viridian forest in the originals
Yes it was
otakon: Hmm......I think you're right. :O
I was playing Pokemon Blue on my gameboy the other day
And caught pikachu in the viridian forest
nice
Nice catch.
Also, to add to this list: you can catch a Pidgeotto in Viridian, with enough pateince.
*patience
okay serious question time
Reikim: One of my earliest encounters was a pidgeotto. :$
Dark92Enigma: No really, it was some crazy luck
Reikim: Ive only caught one twice the entire time I've been playing... I STILL play it.
I walked through the whole of the forest
Patience Robin......---Slade
my mom has been acceptting but unliking of me being a brony
Without a single encounter
Then right at the end I got one
oh
And it was a pikachu
My friend had to walk up and down there for about 30 miuntes to get one
that being said she has finally agreed to watch an episode with me
big deal dari i caught a pikachu within five minets of starting pokemon yellow
XD
Pikachu is wayyy easier to find than I Pidgeotto in the Viridan forest...
Ihop1: :D
which one should i show her to make the best first impression?
*A
I had Yellow, so I started with a Pikachu. Suck it.
dynamo2814: What is your mom like in terms of personality?
calmer version of pinkie
Reikim: You also got all the starters. Youre spoiled :/
dynamo2814: Try showing her some episode that she can relate to.
Damn straight.
dynamo2814: hmmm... maybe luna eclipsed or... um... party of one or a friend in deed
My Charizard wrecked. Shit.
uh what is going on with my stream?
/me got a shiny totadile at the start of HG :$
Reikim: Fire team, Master Race
I know
its buffering... but its still playing....
Dovah: refresh
And my Blastoise tanked shit.
Dovah: then the end is neigh
There's also only a 5% chance of a pikachu encounter in the last bit of grass at Viridian forest
So that just makes it all the less likely
I got the bronystate playlist:$
twilight_sprinkle: :O i see what u did there :|
dayum
rarity :P
But it did happen, well if you believe I'm not bullshitting
Reikim: :D No love for grass types
think i mght try luna she might like her.
I got the bronystate playlist :)
:$
CCCP: You can look up encounter percentages on the internet, but a friend told me
CCCP: easy, serebii.net
^
oh
dynamo2814: Try that one.
best pokemon resource is serebii
On the other hand, my Primape kicked ass, my Dugtrio threw rocks and caused earthquakes, and my Weepinbell was broken as fuck.
Reikim: broken how? XD
Did it take a while?
dynamo2814: IF she likes villain, show her Return Of Harmony.
Reikim: Gyrados, Hyper Beam. Enough said
bye bye everyone
Reikim: Weepinbell? No Victreebell?
bye CCCP take care
bai CCCP
bye CCCP
Bye CCCP
bye CCCP
How could Weepinbell NOT be broken? Sleep Powder owns everything! I tanked my entire rival battle with Sleep Powder, Razor Leaf and Acid!
Bye, CCCP :)
bye CCCP
i would but she only agreed to thirty minutes so :(
Reikim: I never used one TBH, I overlooked grass types
See ya CCCP
dammit now I want to play Pokemon again
I also did some glitch to get Mew on my Blue cartridge. <:
^
otakon: Do IT!
2,14 Dari: the abra glitch?
Caramel: might I suggest just hyper training?
Yeah
oni_link: I shall download it to my tablet
Grass types kicked ass in G1. Anything that could cause sleep kicked ass.
At the nugget path
but i did it on Red :>

Anypony here do theMissingno glitch?
oni_link: eeyup I love it
not unless it broke your game
Dark92Enigma: get it for PC
otakon: Get droidemulite
victrybell is best pokemon wiyh golem
otakon: I see your Flying/Water and I hit it with a quick Thunder from my Pikachu. DIE SEA DRAGON DIE.
ok so a couple of days ago i saw that the las pegasus convention will be feb. 22 next year.....and i thought to myself that is the day after my birthday.....BEST PRESENT EVER!
Obsidian: I did just to mess around with it. I saw level 256 Pokemon D:
dynamo2814: Okay. Also, try Lesson Zero.
Reikim: it never happened in my game but I never fought a human opponent, However when that happened I just used Graveler
I loved Graveler
I wanted a Golem forever but never could find someone with a another copy
Graveler>Golem
otakon: same with Ponymon? also, no virus involved? last time i had a virus, my computer crashed
gravler was a bro
Dynamo2814: which episode did you choose?
^
my video frose
froze*
Dark92Enigma: yeah it just depends where you got yours from
dynamo2814: refresh
otakon: Weepinbell puts it to sleep and violates it with tentacles. That or Dugtrio buries you under a continent. Or Mankey karate-chops you into little bits. Your choice, really.
froze*
What is this now?
Dark92Enigma: My name is also some of the random characters in certain positions so I can catch pokemon with the ghost sprite from Lavender town
Reikim: Hyper Beam kills you inone hit
ponymon!!
pony_4733: Ponymon
Reikim: 99% of the time
K, what's that?
pony_4733: Pokemon but with ponies
pony_4733: a mod hack for the GBA Pokemon games that let you catch MLP ponies instead
otakon: I have to disagree with you on that one
otakon where did i get my virus? Oh, you mean the game? No, i played it via game-boy emulator
otakon: Pikachu out-speeds you with Thunder. So does Dugtrio with Earthquake. So does Mankey with a fist to the face. So does Weepinbell with Sleep Powder. So does- I could go all day.
Your pony has no socks! what's wrong with you.
otakon i got the virus from a free-manga page
Hmmm, doesn't seem like ti would have much variety.
Meanwhile: :D
Reikim: G1 is best generation for PKMN
Well not THE ghost in the tower, just a pokemon with the same sprite as that
Reikim: Flying are immune to Earthquake and I even used him to beat electric types
Dark92Enigma: odd
dat dash
She's so fluffy
otakon: Obviously you never met THIS Pikachu. Besides, can't beam shit if you're asleep.
Rainbow dash used dash... what a surprise
otakon do you have it for pc?
Reikim: yeah well my Gyrados was fast enough to beat out any competition. God I miss that big fish.

Good to hear, Ponies47
Dark92Enigma: warner bros felt looney tunes lacked diversity.. so they made lola. after all, a token female makes it instantly a diverse cast
Adult Derpy also shows up in Cerulean Cave but that's too far off
I think im getting on when I get back
oni_link: How about you?
Freefall29: i have nothing against lola, i'm quoting the Nostalgia Critic

Not great, but not good.

Not all of it.

Dark92Enigma: This is what Doug said about LT Show Lola:
Dark92Enigma: ""How did they turn Lola Bunny, the most bland and unfunny of Looney Tunes, into one of the most hilariously awkward psychopaths in recent memory? Maybe it's Kristen Wiig's voice, maybe it's just great writing, but she kills me. The image of her smiling in the rain is one of the funniest visuals I've seen in awhile."

Hello
I will be back later. I have to go home now :P See ya all in a bit
If SPIKE IS SINGING in season 3, AJ MUST have her own song in season 3.

Hiya RAWRity ^_^ Hi Sumica! Hi all~
You know just so I'm not making a ass of my self, what do Desktop computers have over laptops?
hey LadyCanary
Freefall29: Already have.
Dat LadyCanary. o:
SpadeMagnes[R], better performance for the dollar.
Hello. <:
00,10upgradeable SpadeMagnes[R]
suddenly LadyCanary
why are they just going back and forth
So would it be worth getting a desktop instead of a laptop?
SpadeMagnes[R]: upgradeable, usually have better specs for price, allow for larger monitors, not required to use a premade keyboard.
.
Who is streaming btw?
LadyCanary: Caramel
This mod intrigues me.
10!puellamagi
SpadeMagnes[R], if portability isn't a concern, absolutely
Ahhhh.
Skylands, you are 114Kyoko Sakura.
Val is
00,10desktops tend to have better preformace as well
10:
With the Pokemans
10:3
SpadeMagnes[R]: depends. If you don't need the mobility, I'd go for the Desktop over a lappy.
Also hi LadyCanary
spade magnes more speed
I dont intend of taking a computer out of the house
AJIsAwesome: What Robot Chicken would do with Spongebob, is to make him have a son WITH SANDY of all people (shocking, but funny) what.....that OTHER SHOW would do is steal Spongebob, and say ''oh there it is''. All in all, fuck that other show
You know one of the MLP forums I'm on is doing a game for Season 3. Like you try to guess what may happen in the episode when it airs and if you're right you get points, and at the end of the season they'll give prizes
Gaming laptops are absurdly expensive.
I got my dad to decide to get me a desktop instead
SpadeMagnes[R]: then yeah, Desktop's preferable IMO
tms don't work yet
He had the most bullshit reason for saying no to me at first
"Because you can't move it"
IM GETTING XBOX NEXT WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

I know how to work a computer well but trying to build one? I have no chance in hell
copyright CustomState 2012
Princess_Cadence: ponies?
Ponies are never on stream
Lies
00,10true RAWRity, but the actaly assembly is realy easy if you just look at the bits
Ew, Ponies. :|
Anyone at all...
looks like pokemon if you ask me
I'm going to go with a pre built because I have no job
ponies are forbidden, unless its G3
00,10you cant put it together wrong unless you use a hammer.
hi BileGraze
Hi, friend.
>Ponies
Only 10 more levels until she's grown Derpy
>Gen 4
HA
Sumica: true. Worst part of assembling most custom builds is just cable management.
I MAY consider getting parts for it if I ever get a job
http://cheezburger.com/6588985088
Sumica: and if you fail at that... grab some duck tape.
Do you know any good metal PMV's?
fucking cable management...
SpadeMagnes[R], it's quite user friendly nowadays. Look up videos on the internet for it. You will get a lot more upgradability with a custom-built PC than with a prebuilt.
SO. MANY. ZIP TIES.
Whats cable management?
Wait, how do I respond to people?
I doubt my dad would let me build my own computer
BileGraze: What do you mean?
00,10most my cables have that mesh shrinkwrap on it already
By the way.........we should have Nostalgia Critic's review of Space Jam this friday!
BileGraze: Smile like you mean it is rock but it's good all the same
SpadeMagnes[R]: cable management is basically tying all the various cables togetther and keeping them out of the way of parts, the fan, the airflow, heatsinks etc
Who ever just responded to me, type it agian, I glitched out for a couple seconds.
00,10I even did that back with my IDE cables. pilled them apart so I could have a cable bundle rather then a ribon
RAWRity: Yea..see I would be horrible at that shit
hmm ill be back all washroom break
@Princess_Cadence Hi.
How I do it? D:
http://cheezburger.com/6588966144
But at least I know now that Desktops are worth it
00,10once I got to vegas i gave up on worrying about airflow. I just built my computer case out of a mini fridge
2,14 no one wants to watch my grind, I'll put on pmv's until we're ready to start up again
Nevermind. Everyone is discussing other stuff and I don't think anyone will help. I'll just go to a different server.
Laptops are ok, but it doesnt give me the speed I need on my games
08,01my god
It lags like shit
08,01i'm going into a school tomorrow
:O OH GAWD.
WOAH MAN
Nice. :O
08,01my first day as a teaching assistant
WOAH
Google chrome is the best browser I ever used
SpadeMagnes[R]: well maybe you're just not buying the right laptop.... my laptop is a powerhosue
Good luck sweetie!
Hi ya peeps.
08,01I'M TERRIFIED D:
What.
Well theres no way I can tell what goes fast and what doesnt
I spilled chocolate milk on me ;___________;
you'll do good man
08,01i'm a "Student Ambassador" for the university
08,01which means i'll be helping the teachers and running a project with some of the pupils
AJIsAwesome: Are you being sarcastic<?
murr...
ok I'm back. what happened to ponymon?
how much swap space will i need
Dark92Enigma: No. :S
Oh, now I get it.
Back and hello BillGraze
the ultimate question lol
weeping_pegasi82: we watching PMV now
Wait, I still don't.
lol
How much ramz?
d
Well, if you're ambassador, I hope you can properly represent the students.
what song is this anyways...
2GB
I assume a desktop would run WoW at decent settings at a fast speed
AJIsAwesome: why you're not in the mood for ponies today? we were streaming Ponymon!
Freefall29: Mitternacht
08,01RAWRity: no idea yet; probably about 15, 16
My ram is 8GB and swap is ~11gb
Dark92Enigma: What do you mean? I love ponies. :P
08,01but... guess what i'm running my project on?
Did I do it?
Is it pony related?
SpadeMagnes[R]: as long as it's got 2-3 GB of RAM, sure, shouldn't be an issue at all.
ok wait....so whats wrong with cadence?
08,01ethical hacking.
So 3GB swap is good enough lol
So I can tell, where do you go on your computer to check its stats?
lul
K, bye. :(
08,01i want to take in a router and teaech them how to hack it
BileGraze: Type in part od their name and then push tab.
AJIsAwesome: a few minutes ago ''Oh, Ponies :|''
lol
AJIsAwesome: :O
Dark92Enigma: i was being sarcastic. :D
darnit
it's so sad
AJIsAwesome: Consistency, What's that?
K,b ye.
why are they removing mint4windows
Honestly
AJIsAwesome: Oh
In other words, white hat hacking?
Really?
08,01Kandarihu: yup
I never cared
Freefall29: http://cheezburger.com/6588966144
Or used it LOL
now what are we watching the game is over
I just natively did it
COUNFOUND THAT SARCASM! IT LEADS ME TO UNPROTECTED BUTT FUN
Bronysith: I saw this earlier man. awesome
2,14 mfw no one reads what I type
well they haven't removed it but make it more irritating
And grey hat hacking?
2,14 I'm just putting on PMVs while I grind their levels up
in linux mint 13 the only mint4windows they have is for 64 bit only
SpadeMagnes[R]: well, it should tell you it on the box when you buy it, but you can also check the control panel (assuming you're using windows)
08,01Spectrum_Rush: i could teach you anyway
08,01it's actually quite easy to get started in hacking
We need each other!~
kingdom hearts <3
/me is intrigued
13it's easy to pass as a hacker
13step 1, acquire terminal emulator
13step 2, acquire textmode irc client
step 2 ?
13step 3, chat
im not kidding when i say this but i will cry if or when the show gets cancelled
Shizuka: step 4: ?????
13step 4, who knows what goes on in other people's heads, aka ???
then profit?
Shizuka: step 5: profit
13step 5, OMFG SHE'S HACKING THE PENTAGON SUSPEND HER COMPUTER PRIVILEGES
lol
13you now know how my high school years went
My dad said it would take longer to buy a desktop..so now I'm confused which is more powerful...
XD
Yah
oh shizuka....
Which makes NO sense :|
Shizuka: teach me you're ways so I can experience endless hours of lulz
Shizuka: your
ZOMG! She's DDOSing the ISS! Someone remotely delete her System32!
What ever I get I'm stuck with for awhile
pro tip: always use a proxy.
I nearly got kicked out of high school when I tried to upgrade the RAM in my Computer in one of my classes.
13see.. when you're brought to the principal's office... i mean the "administrator's" office... and you can explain in more detail what you were doing than they can
00,03That's why I disguise my work in the computer as Ponies, or, under drastic measures...
13and you actually get the details right
Pro tip, use a VPN instead
wasn't it you who told me to use mint4windows if possible
in case grub screws up lol
Don't see what they were so pissed about.
I hack my schools network all the time
Wow. The lifespan of my joke was well past half over by the time I sent that.
03sigh
03use GRUB
03HML is stupid sometimes, just trust me on this
yet they yell at kids who go on flash games
I payed for the RAM sticks myself.
03it's super easy to fix GRUB if it breaks
drf
03you just need a livebooting disc
03or flash drive
i'm only asking if he's the one who said it
13at one point we'd collected a handful of the network admin passwords, all variations on "P@ssw0rd" of course
13never used them
or else i will forever be cursed of not knowing who said that
Lawl
:D
Scoot-Scootaloo: if drastic then r34 ponies? nobody will dare to lack at that
smile like you mean it!
00,03>_>
lol this :D
*look
;)
13we had the address for the district's network proxy and frequently routed ssh tunnels around it
AMD Athlon X2 Dual-Core QL-64 2.10 GHz is the processor of my current computer
yay~
yay
AJ!
I dont know computer power so I have NO idea how bad or good that is
Congrats
Caramel: Congrats
13actually my best story is that in my last year i was banned from computers for like half the year because i ran VNC to my home desktop so i could use a version of MSOffice that wasn't from 1993
SpadeMagnes[R]: it's not awful. Decent for AMD
11,0264 ping o.o
13but OMFG YOU COULD LET VIRUSES IN
Shizuka: remind me to never piss you off.....
/me glomps NewSuperBronyU
/me hugs Bronysith back :D
it has 3.00 GB of RAM
NewSuperBronyU: \:3/
00,10I think my computer has lost it's mind, time for restart
SpadeMagnes[R]: that's fine then.
11,02Derpy_Hooves: \:3/
/me hugs \:3/

I wonder why it lags like a motherfucker though
03I love how he accuses people of saying he has a dirty mind
03look at how the song is spelled
hi derpy
Derpy_Hooves! SuperBrony! :3
dat Bob :3
SpadeMagnes[R]: not laging for me bro
http://cheezburger.com/6570266112
LadyCanary: \:3/ *hugs*
just learned the basics of paint.net about background and icon making, its alot of fun
I mean when ever I do shit like play WoW it lags like a bitch
SpadeMagnes[R]: could very well be your internet
http://www.codeweavers.com/flockthevote/ < Haha
lol
SpadeMagnes[R]: when did you buy your pc?
I never said anything about grub
or mint4win
O.o
Using VB script in Excel to get around Windows software restriction policy was pretty funny
I dislike the windows installers anyway
lol
I only said GRUB is slow
dat derpy
Oh god...this was years ago and this isnt even mine origionaly.. let me see...
03GRUB isn't slow o.o
03GRUB2 is just a bloated pile of crap
Caramel, awesome
...So this is a pretty good place to get join up the stream, isn't it?
That's what I meant
03simple: use the original one..
GRUB2 takes like 5 seconds JUST to load the menu :|
Uh how
03by using an older version of Linux obviously.
03and if it's something like Ubuntu, when you upgrade it, you can tell it to keep the older GRUB
SpadeMagnes[R]: this is a good sign your pc is getting old
I think 3 years...I dont really recall
lol this is hilarious :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OviK2FWFom0&feature=g-u-u
SpadeMagnes[R]: laptop or desktop?
Laptop
Three years? Oh, that's just middle age in computer tERMS> Don't sweat it.
I said I think 3 years I really dont remember how long I had this thing
...this guy fails history. Forever.
i wonder if scoot will ever fly? season 4 perhaps?
i don't think i'll have enough time to get linux up tonight
>implying there will be a S4
Reikim: that's good seeing as he's Historical Inaccuracy
It has a really low Window's Index rating
...Canadian Stereotype.
Maybe they'll finish at 3
a 3.1
if there is a season 4
I love this guy.
lol
dari implying theres a 3
Why are you installing it any way?
RAWRity: We can always live in hope
I just want to see the reactions when FiM ends
So many delicious tears
princess cadence....dont say that....there will be at least there better be
I don't. There's going to be SO much butthurt
Implying it won't
I think I had this since 2009, I'm just guessing here
because a coin flip told me to
We'll see...
65 episodes and a feature length film.
I liked the first WTF Collective, not the second one
Fuck yes, Canada.
/me hands you Harvey Dent's coin
Finished.
Spectrum_Rush: AHAHAHAH
actually drf
Yes, of course
what is this?
Beautiful
tails was to install windows 7
heads was to keep windows vista XD
o-o
So you didn't flip it!
if it was harvey dent's coin
Dovah: PMv.
Lazy :P
I'm going to take a shower... I'll be back in a few
it would have been heads
Hey everyone
sup Wirisme!!
Hi, Wirisme! :)
hi Wirisme :)
And then delicious tears time?
How are we all today? :)
>implying I care if it finishes
I'm pretty sure the highest they'll go is season 4. If they make any later seasons, that'd be great.
?
college almost forces me to use windows
YUS
yes
Pfft
dat spike
It's going to end sometime
So who here has played the Applejack one? Because that was really hard.
oh twilight
Reikim: I have.
Bullshit
i think theyll make nore than 4 just because of the fandom
Same with my school
Some 3 minute shorts that took months?
And I've gotten tired of how horrible the image they want
Be distracted by the Twi in the background. Be very distracted.
o.o
They're not going to have time to make full episodes
You can't be admin, can't easily change the *taskbar or background*
well my technical reporting teacher puts docx files on blackboard
Oh, she lost her trumpet
So it's ugly :z
Not unless they quit their jobs
And we fund them all
Pay their salary
that libreoffice has no idea how to show correctly
She found it
I would
Ouch
weell this is.....strange
and it's so bad that i can barely read some parts of the document
then i have a crystal report writer class
I use Windows because A, its compatible with more hardware and B, more niche and special purpose software runs on it
Besides, if fans were to continue the show, it would get old and stale.
http://cheezburger.com/6582474240
i use linux because i feel more comfy security wise
the average hacker isn't going to suspect the average computer user to be using linux
DashWithRainbows: And the OCs
how many times have we seen this on bronystate?
I use linux because I want to troll the IT Department ;D
Oh God, the OCs
well true, if fans did it we wouldnt see the same characters
BURN IT
CX
KILL IT WITH FIRE
<.<
And I can screw with stuff and break it then fix it
Look at Rarity. So much class.
Look at the Pokemon anime, that's been going on for years. Only now are they trying to make an actual change by getting rid of Ash and putting in different characters.
Whos up for season 3:)
2,14 yeah, just gonna put it out there. I dont care if FiM is cancelled at the time, I will NOT show a fucking fanmade episode
we would have pitch-black OCs with blood-red eyes and "PWNER" cutie marks
you can't run $hit on Linux
me!
So much negativity
with wine or virtualbox you can
00,03Me.... maybe
>Implying every OC is bad
anyway i got to bbl
Yeah, I'mma gonna focus on Rarity and her mad golfing skills.
2,14 if used in a fanshow? yes, it is
Lol
oh let me show you my OC
apparently some relatives are just giving away a laptop to me
and i need to go pick it up
/me hates OC elitism.
dari Red striped alicorn OC's with bat wings and have sex with all the mane 6... Yep, sounds like an awesome show.
O-o
Again implying every OC is bad
heres my OC http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo86/kyuubi_yura/ponyart_ed.jpg
not really
DashWithRainbows: wut XD
00,10did I come back to drama?
the software I use can't be ruin with Wine
I just REALLY want to hear Fluttershy's complaints about the dress Rarity made for her in a results section of this.
or Virtualbox
I gues you did
If I felt the fanmade "episode" was quality, I'd show it.
its too demanding in terms of CPU clock cycles
WHAT AN ORIGINAL OC IT'S AWESOME WHAT'S ITS STORY
twilight_sprinkle: paint pony is best pony
00,03No sumi, you came to a bronystate chatroom :P
O U
Do ho ho
Take a look at Picture Perfect Pony
That had good quality
Um, no.
cx
i love that pmv
There are roads that a pony must pony.
Again, 3 minute short, not full episode, already established characters.
...Applejack is best Samurai. FORever.
Well, if an OC-centric fan episode has the feel of a lower deck episode of the main series, I'd appreciate it.
SpadeMagnes[R]: I agree, proof that fans can make good videos
please note, I said can
Reikim: Agreed.
No, it really can't
Depends how many people work on it
I love the props in the back from the other events
then comes getting audio and stuff.
00,03besides, I already saw parts of DRB, it was eh~
but can fans make full episodes with good animation, good writing and to keep the characters personalities in check? i doubt it
03well that sucked
Because they'd fuck up by either catering too much to bronies, or adding in OCs, or just plain shitty story writing
^
03there's a leak in the water cooler, it's making the floor wet
^^
03and since it's tile
SUUUUPPPAAAAAAAAAA
03I was walking to the bathroom and slipped on it
03banged up my knee
03fricking limping now
also biased writing
Again...implying each of them would be retarded with their ideas
03and I don't even kinow if there's enough towls in this house to dry it
Anyway...a Rhythm Heaven pony game like this? Man,m if only it could really exist.
My sim keeps wanting to woohoo in the hot tub... She can't go in the hot tub now....
still waiting for Fighting is Magic
it's coming
RAWRity: thats still in development... wow
HEllo
suddenly deaf
I played some of it, RAWRity. So far Im working well with Pinkie Pie.
hiya Storm_Chaser
yay more ponymon!
Now...More making colourfulo cartoon ponies fight each other to the death.
RAWRity: Soon™
Ah I haven't seen this :)
00,10Naughty nature
Also: Bronystate has its own music thingie now? I'm interested.
LadyCanary: I avoided playing the leaked demo.
Spectrum_Rush: I see what you did there
hiya LadyCanary :)
/) RAWRity
Twilight is OP in leaked demo
Kandarihu: (\
F ZECORA?
Filly
/me hugs Otakon tightly "Thanks"
00,10Filly, aparently
Reikim, Filly Zecora
How is Everypony today?
Aha
I never bother playing demos or leakd stuff. I always play the full version of things.
Storm_Chaser: awesome.
BIG MAC CAN TAKE THIS
Hi Storm_Chaser :)
Freefall29: have you played the leaked demo? i dont want to spoil anything for you
00,10Demos are good, leaks are not
Yus
YUS
then again, no spoilers in main
.-.
Bronysith: yep
Colours~
Yes code geass ost!!
I'd still rather just wait for the full game rather than playing a demo.
I hate I have to decide wether I want a Laptop or desktop..what ever I pick I'm stuck with it for awhile...
Code Geass's best Opener
^
/me Hugs AJIsAwesome "Thanks"
SpadeMagnes[R]: true, but with a desktop you can upgrade it
Freefall29: look at their livestreams, you'll see why. You can tell as of the demo shes the most worked on character
00,10SpadeMagnes[R], are you on the go alot?
SpadeMagnes[R]: D you travel around a lot?
00,10and for that matter will you have acces to web if on the go.
Wel..not now I'm homeschooled and I dont go out much
Desktop.
I dont even have a car of my own yet
Pinkie apperently used to be OP, but then they completely nerfed her
00,10aye desktop
It's odd. CG's openings kind of went downhill. COLOURS was awesome. R2's first opening was acceptable, and grew on you. R2's second opening...I just can't like it.
Freefall29: oh yeah, theyll fix it as best they can by beta
doctor whooves!!!!
hehe a dr Whooves
Freefall29: "personal bias"
what
Freefall29: They don't. It's just really, really hard to make a balanced fighting game.
Reikim: i just think the first opening is the best
Dr. Whooves. :O
hi Storm_Chaser didn't see you there i just came back :)
00,10ewwwwww they used that version of whooves
:O Dr.Whooves?!
2,14 sumica: my thoughts exactly
DAMMIT
Sumica: damn straight they did.
Wrong Whooves!
2,14 why the fuck use a custom one to look like matt smith?
any news yet on unlockable characters yet for fighting is magic?
2,14 the Tennant one is canon AND looks cooler
lol
00,10exactly
tab fail RAWRity?
er, I meant Sumica
WEll thanks for the greeting thelonepony :)
I guess Desktop it is then
Freefall29: We're not going to get any news on that until after Version 1. But the roster is already created; we just won't know about it until they start adding free DLC.
00,10wait.......
00,10F Doctor?
Kill it.
KILL IT.
Sumica: foal
2,14 filly doctor
f Doctor
:);)season 3
lol http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/162/996/45962%20-%20David_Tennant%20Doctor_Whooves%20ask_doctor_whooves%20human.png
Damn you Smith. Get outta hERE!
00,10perhaps they should difrenciate better
I don't mind doubts about shows being good the longer they go on, but when it sounds like downright hate, it bothers me
00,10So will you name him Not tennet?
I've heard a rumor about a my little pony fps game being made by fans.... Its probobly gonna go through a lot of hurdles.
hey guys they did include the tennant one here:http://ponymondawndusk.wikia.com/wiki/D_WHOOVES
I'm okay so far, Deleted my tumblr account
http://ponymondawndusk.wikia.com/wiki/D_WHOOVES
Actually Sumica Caramel That Matt Smith one is the fully evolved one. The middle evolution looks like Tennet
damn link crashed me
Oh god I hate these headphones
2,14 but he evolves into the shit one
2,14 thus fail
nopony exided for seaosn? :'(
Figures Smith would evolve into Tennant. It just plain wouldn't work the other way around.
DOCTOR VS DERPY!
00,03chhchickenCX: Season 3 already came out!
^
00,03...for Family Game Night
oh WHAT?
they make certian sounds that I dont normally hear and it bothers me

Oh good the rocket grunts have the ponies I hate

chhchickenCX: dude just stop

chhchickenCX, we still don't know
Season 3 will hopefully have ponies
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/DXyjTf.jpg
I doubt it.
It will not.
I have this dinosaur of a desktop in my room
WE DON'T KNOW, NOBODY KNOWS... SPACE!!!!
My friedn wanted to know badly guess i wikk tell them its unknown
RAWRity: no, they got replaced with cyborgs
Its so god damn old
It'll be all about Tom.
hey a trixie :O
Season 3 will be spike spinoff
inb4 season 3 has no ponies
Oh, Val.
/me violently agrees
Caramel: :D
xD
:O
i get the feeling Caramel does not like trixie
When did Windows change the box design to be less blocky?
Wirisme: that would be awesome. 13 episodes of non-stop spike. *explodes*
DIE TRIXIE DIE
lol @ Val
Sumica: that thar's some fancy photoshop

Sumica: Depends on which version of "befriending" you're using. I prefer the version that involves KILLING EVERYTHING IN FIRE
what sucks is that I work on saturdays.... I miss out on ponies! :'(
00,10especaly when I cant photoshop RAWRity
And GIANT MAGIC LASER BEAMS
i have a feeling Caramel loves Trixie
Sumica: clearly your computer's sentient
00,10I was refering to the Nanoha version Reikim|Crowbar
...So wait, Trixie is a PSYCHIC type?
Reikim|Crowbar: seems legit
Sumica: Funny, that's what I was referring to. /), by the way.
00,10you know hitthem with gundam class beamweapons
My super old desktop has the very very old version of the window design
Lol if he picked party.MOV
Having issues with your angsty teenage daughter? NUKE HER WITH MAGICAL LASER BEAMS
:O Trixie~!
all this da music
Reikim|Crowbar: and the beams do what again to her?
Sumica, I tried looking up that date on EqD but got nothing.
Your best friend refusing to open up to you? NUKE HER WITH MAGICAL LASER BEAMS.
yesss!!
aj won
Your students acting up and not behaving? Guess how we deal with that one.
Good to see Team Rocket is incompetent as ever

what pony does team rocket send after you
00,10it was EQD falling for a troll and I caught a screen shot of it
sistervsbro
Sumica: I gotta see that screen
And as everyone knows, Applejack can beat the living friendship out of Big Mac.
otakon: What was the emulator you talked about? CoolRooms, right?
00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/DXyjTf.jpg
Ah, I see.
00,10the W in network is actaly two V's
Dark92Enigma: DopeRoms for ROMS and emulators.
Sumica: that troll deserves +10 internets.
I used to think EQD had decency and quality to it and the sources it gets
00,10so it's Netvvork
lol
I find it funny that some people i've talked to STILL think S3 will start in september
Wear pony shirts if you have one for season 3
OMIGAH DINKY CATCH HER
BIG MAC'S GOT DIS
Reikim: DGemu's also good
he already did
clonewars
Sumica: 4 more dayz. hurr durr
...Damn. Imagine a cloned army of Big Macintosh.
tiill what?
Maybe in a later release, Ponymons like F Big Mac will be listed as C Big Mac
ohai trixie
00,10seeing as there have not even been ads for it
oh yeah, people will be rushing on that day
KILL THE IDIOT
00,10yeah we are still at least a month from it
chhchickenCX: EQD fell for a troll claiming that season 3 starts on sept 22....
I want to see him in pain
Ah, I see.
thats a new one
I call it premieres the second week of November
Why did I actually think EQD was decent?
I say season 3 starts on dec 22, 2012
00,10I would like to see an oct 26 air date.
awww
Sumica: People are stupid/desperate. One guy I know said he expected advertisements/announcements this saturday, and then S3 would start September 29
I guessed oct. 13
Remind me, isn't that the 'end of the world' date Freefall29?
Freefall29: oh come on it cant be that long, im guessing late october
Sumica: that sounds about right. I'm personally expected November
*expecting
00,10just think some day they might add r63 ponymons to this
End of the world...yea... and we've had how many "predictions" of the end of the world now?
ohai Lasharus, haven't seen you around here for a while.
I can't wait till dec 21st and everyone looks like a major douchebag.
well do the math...theres only 13 episodes told by tara strong so im guessing october but maybe sebtember
Lasharus: Yes. On December 21, 2012, the split universes will collide together once more, and in their collision all will be crushed. We will burn in the hellfires of dimensional collapse...and it will all be /his/ fault.
|It probably will be late October, some people said it will be four weeks after they announce the airdate
00,10oh I just want a happy birthday is all RAWRity I dont even thnk it's a saterday =p
september**
Oh I know SpadeMagnes[R]. I don't really set any store whatsoever by it. :P
And why are people listening to the aztecs again?
god ... the amount of tards that will be running round on that day Freefall
chhchickenCX: remember, without math we are dirty caveman eating mud!!!!
weeping_pegasi82: it was the myans
I'm not looking forward to december. The internet will be filled with 2012 memes
whatever
I'll be sitting here chilling playing WoW
You know what? There really should be a Pokemon romhack that just swaps the humans and the Pokemon.
Reikim, I have no idea which theory THAT one is, but it sounds remarkably inane.
And if they announce it at Canterlot Gardens then it would be the 27th
Wirisme: dude. around early december. i'm gonna ask people to give me their stuff, like houses or money. they won't need it when they're dead
Does no one ever fucking think the Myans never finished their calendar or just stopped?
Lasharus: Actually it was a reference to RahXephon and I was hoping RAWRity would pick up on it but oh well.
Sounds like a plan lol
D'aw. Sorry Reikim. :p
stupid myans
Anyway, bedtime f'r me. Got work tomorrow.
'night.
good afternoon everyone ^_^
Hope the idiots don't riot too hard
bye bye Lasharus
So it stopped on ONE DAY that means fucking nothing
SpadeMagnes[R]: They did neither. They just reset it. Like a giant clock.
Nightm Lasharus
@superretroworld lol
Him OneTrickPony
*Hi
SpadeMagnes[R], a lot of people realize that the Mayans didn't really predict the end of the world.
night Lasharus
ugh did it wrong v.v
hey OneTrickPony
you guys remember the may 21st raptures.... its all coming back to me now
00,10exactly SpadeMagnes[R]
when will this video end
Is there no other reason besides people being fucking morons when they "assumed" the end of the calendar was doomsday
what are we watching?
00,10start writeing numbers on a page of paper, sooner or later you run out of space
SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, the fucking move
Okaaaay, clearing things here. The Mayan Calendar...doesn't end. It resets. Like a clock. Hell, the Gregorian calendar did the same thing years ago, nobody gave a damn.
What The Mayans Thought: http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Mayan_01d220_1849449.jpg
even the myans are sick and tried of this whole end of the world thing.... the calender was written eons ago, back in a time we thought the world was flat and earth was the center of the universe.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Thank you.
Of all the conclusions they could have drawn and its doomsday
SpadeMagnes[R]: Exactly. :|
Why is humanity plauged with retards
...
Nobody listened.
SpadeMagnes[R]: retards with liberal arts degrees
I listened
spademagnes good question
So how dead are we today?
Go Derpy!
i'm gonna brb everypony
not more than normal
ditzy doo
bye Freefall29
Rate it on a level from "cessation of all existence past present and future" to "shambling zombie".
bai Freefall29
Bye Freefall29
see ya Freefall29
bye Freefall29
SpadeMagnes[R], we are imperfect mortal beings. The worst of us are the ones who are convinced that we are not, and that relying on our own sense of reasoning leads to enlightenment.
byee
i'm not leaving guys....
lol
lolk
you know what i find sad about Ponymon Dawn/Dusk
Freefall29: sorry, didnt read the text right
Go Ditzy!
i'm just gonna leave the pc for a second. tis all
what?
Discord-Drocsid: What?
that hoof stomp isnt actually accurate
what?
Kandarihu: I agree with the former, not the latter. Depends on your definition of enlightenment.
^
its completely upside down
how
I get tired of the "Doomsday prediction" crap that shows up on tv
Im kinda getting sick of this video..
00,10Oh god, new TV show. Toy hunter, first ep Hasbro colectors items.
2,14 that's because they use the stomp graphic
both ?
2,14 which is based off of Tauros
http://www.all-natural-horse-care.com/image-files/feral-horse-hoof.jpg
I saw it, Sumica :D
Wasnt glue made from horse feet?
...oh my god
Well, not that ep but the show itself is pretty cool
there cartoons get over it
where is it
NASA has apparently started working on Warp Drive technology.
what channel
SpadeMagnes[R]: It used to be made from various parts of horses, but know it isn't, I think.
00,10dont know, just saw an ad for it
Reikim, okay. Maybe enlightenment wasn't the right thing to put it.
Val, this sounds awfully familiar. What song is this?
Kandarihu: Besides, those who utilize reason as a tool for finding truth msot often inevitably come to the conclusion that we are imperfect.
KILL IT
Ok serriously..
KILL IT
SPIKE :O
DAT LASS
:P
DIE SPIKE DIE
I saw this one thing on tv that said some philosipher, I forget his name, predicted several things in our time and a supposed" dooms day"
twilight_sprinkle, yeah.
Spike getting pumped. Awwww.
Go AppleJack!
just made some pizza from scratch and MAN is it good :$
lol
SpadeMagnes[R]: Nicodemus. He was a druggie. True facts.
yum
Next is Twilight.
you know, everyone is an awful friend to twilight except Applejack really
00,10wonder if spike evloves in to macho spike
That's kinda true.
:D
00,10or just spike with stash
So we belive the words of one man who may not be right in the head
so how long does it take to get out of a cave?
back
I know wrek want's an F Twilight
Bronysith: what do you mean?
SpadeMagnes[R]: No we don't. Most people will tell you he's bullshit. Most people haven't even heard of him, in fact.
So many Big Macs.
superretroworld: in the season 2 finale, applejack is the only one to apologize to her, out of all her friends, applejack is the only one with the decency to apologize
theyre like zubat arent they
HOW LONG IS THIS!!?.... :[
Bronysith: Which was one of the reasons why I preferred AJ over any of the others IMO.
A cave full of Big Mac clones. I wonder how the fillies and mares of Ponyville would react to that...
spike evolves into nightmare night spike...
Then there was some bullshit about dooms day being predicted in some Islam manuscript or something
However, our wisdom will always be imperfect and our knowledge will always be limited. The worst atrocities of the 20th centuries were all caused by people who relied on their own sense of reason.
They apologized to her offscreen I think, but yeah you have a point.
SpadeMagnes[R]: Far as I know, the Coran says nothing about Doomsday. There's a bit about a Final Judgement, but no word on a date.
Whoa, it's Snails.
Oh duuuude.
Snails. :O
That is why Applejack is Twilights only nice friend
how come it's always so entertaining to watch someone else play videogames?
Kandarihu: Not because they relied on it, but because their reasoning was faulty.
Bronysith: yeah, but in winter wrashe was pretty harsh to twilight even though it was twilights fault, idk
Nice to know you know that stuff because I never payed attention to that bullshit
wrap up*
Bronysith: riiiiiiiight
sorry big screw up there
darnit
All of our reasoning is faulty.
superretroworld: but she is the only one to apologize to her when no one else believed her,
i wish i had one of those things now
to convert an internal hard drive into USB
bored now "proceeds to gangnam style on RAWRity s head"
Ooh, there's Colgate.
13the unsung work of a bronystate sysadmin http://i.imgur.com/7rUsn.png
Still annoyed no one apologized to twilight after the wedding fiasco
Gosh Caramel, I didnt realize you liked so much metal music :3 :3 me gusta.
I like to know a bit or two about our local religious groups. Really, after over a dozen years being drowned in Catholicism, you start to welcome the quirks and interesting bits about other religions.
ok... I'm back everypony
Spades, AppleJack did.
Bronysith: shes one of my favorites including pinkie because shes always there
wb Freefall29
13ded ded
lolyey
It's Spike!
spike!
LadyCanary: metal is only the hammer of ...fuck i do not remember the brutal legend reference
Kinda pissed Celestia didnt
SPIKE!!!!
wb Freefall29
Spike!
.....I will slap you Bronysith >_> not for not remembering the quote.
spike is best non pony, non main 6 character
:<
poor spike
Kandarihu: Yes, all reasoning is fundamentally flawed, because we have to make the assumption that our senses are not lying to us. Everything boils down to belief, at some level. Those who choose to disbelieve are, I believe, known as Existentialists.
forever a slave
Fax Machine
LadyCanary: metal is the sound of god hitting his hammer against the anvil of pure bliss
SpadeMagnes[R]: Don't get me wrong, but the fact that they all saw that Twilight ws right all along was good enough for me. i still would've liked it if they apologized, though.
assisstant
Doubel negative, means we're alive.
O_O
Freefall29: so technically hes in competition with the costume twilight rainbow and rarity wore
By the furnace, by the hammer, by the tongs, and by the hammer, by the dwelling of the black smith, by the fire within the furnace
AJIsAwesome: but they didnt apologize! they shouldve but they were like "oh hey, she was right.. what do you know"
Bronysith: I know. I'm just saying.
And Celestia the pony who raised twilight for years, was pretty much a mother to her didnt say shit
Reikim, ever heard of Messianic Judaism?
So one more question....On wikipedia it says the list of the MLP episodes it says season 3 chrystal empire...is that right?
00,10what AJ dont know Buck?
SpadeMagnes[R]: the show lacks consistency, lol
Actually, I was more upset that her own brother didnt apologize to her.
Kandarihu: ...No, actually. What is it?
Now forsooth thou hast grown mighty. Thou canst rage in wildest fury. Thou hast broken all thy pledges, all thy solemn vows hast broken
chhchickenCX: Hey. By the way. Take a trip by the rules page, read the bit on discussing spoilers.
CATCH THAT LYRA!
00,10chhchickenCX, gonna head you off there. Dont go leading in to things taht might be spoilers
dat song
It's Lilly!
...NOOOOOOOO
fuck if theres anyone apoligzing its everyone involved in that wedding
oh no
Wait. Dat Miku? o_o
who's apologzing, for what?
I guess thats one reason why I like Twilight, because the rest of her "friends" can be real jerks sometimes
LadyCanary: there we go ... “It is the pounding of creations hammer on the anvil of time
I just gave the title and i didnt mean to it was on wiki but i dont know if its right.
Sorry
SpadeMagnes[R]: well, execpt spike. since she gives him a free place to stay
I want one of those too
chhchickenCX, yeah. Upcoming episode titles are spoilers. This place is kindof a sanctuary from that.
Wait, didn't during Discord was Twilight being a jerk to her friends and didnt realize they were discorded?
Freefall29: spike is a slave
no no
Game Derps
00,10did't say you were spoiling chhchickenCX, was just heading you off before things went that way
She's Derp, she's not so Derp
Is this some sort of Vocaloid version of Carameldansen?
ya ther's no pinkie pie lrft in that move!
they're the Game Derps
Kandarihu: Cool. Isn't that a bit flawed, though? Religion should adapt to the times, not try to perpetuate stagnation.
Bronysith: thank you
Tell who drove thee to this mischief! Tell who taught thee all thy malice! Tell who givest thee thine evil!
Bronysith: can you stop bringing that up every time I mention spike. you're just trying to piss me off on purprose
*there's
*left
Freefall29: im not trying to piss you off. it is true that spike is a slave
There is the issue that people bring their own bias into reasoning.
>Element of honesty can tell if someone is lying, >Doesnt belive twilight during the wedding
Caramel: That grun took issue to your use of the radio.
Did thy father, or thy mother? Did the eldest of thy brothers? Did the youngest of thy sisters? Did the worst of all thy kindred?
Logic
8grunt
Freefall29: would you prefer the term indentured servant? or how about serf?
Bronysith: he's not a slave, he's a baby dragon Twilight takes care of him
Ditzy Doo? was that the nickname or the actual name in game?
Discord-Drocsid: Nick I think
Bronysith: but you say it every friggin time I bring up spike. I got it the last hundred times you mentioned it
otakon: and he cant leave the house without her permission, and she doesnt even think him as a friend
SpadeMagnes[R]: Technically, she always tells the truth, not senses it.
BRONIES, why won't they leave us alone
Bronysith: ofc she does and he has, remember Dragon Quest?
For the love of God, try to remember that Spike is a child.
otakon: "before coming to ponyville Shining Armor is the only one i acceppted as a friend"
These 2 girls laughed at my derpy drawing..
Bronysith: she was a filly and that was BEFORE Spike became her assistant
They dont lik eponies..
Bronysith: A filly can't take care of a baby dragon
Also Rainbow Dash, Element of Loyalty, doesnt even stick with Twilight
Bronysith: your right, letting a baby dragon who can't fight or defend himself on his own is a great idea
Bronysith: Spike is a bloody child. He's not a friend, he's a responsibility.
otakon: before, she came to ponyville, Before ponyville
otakon: thats 20 years of time
Did the stream go out?
GUYS!
Oh my god this sounds so familiar.
Curses on thee, cruel iron! Curses on the steel thou givest! Curses on thee, tongue fo evil! Cursed be thy life, forever!
Look at Filly Doctor Whooves.
DOE IT FREAKING MATTER?
Discord-Drocsid: Yes?
um guys, i think RAWRity is broken
I don't mind. His poetry is nice.
Bronysith: yeah before Ponyville was her living in the Royal Palace learning magic from Princess Celestia
Discord-Drocsid: Not really, but I'm not going too far intot the debacles.
/me pokes RAWRity with a stick
RAWRity was never fixed to begin with.
RAWRity: why are you quoting what sounds like The Bard?
Well thats it for me today. Goodnight everypony.
RAWRity?
good point, DWR.
bye bye Obsidian
night Obsidian sleep well

hey yo wuts up everypony
Goodnigt Obsidian.

weeping_pegasi82: yes
weeping_pegasi82: not usually but this is Vals personal playlist
darn
weeping_pegasi82: nah, the streamer just ran out of music
it won't work
otakon: it's from The Kalevala
Aw no, Doctor Whooves wasnt captured.
weeping_pegasi82: but there are songs that are played a bit too ften here imo
RAWRity: never heard of it
AJIsAwesome: Ikr
Val should add MAKINAIZE for ALL THE BADASS. Just saying.
theres some people who dont like it..
Yes!
00,10So can you evlove sweetiebelle in to sweetiebot?
:D
why are talking about religion in a website about ponies?
Kandarihu: please don't start that here.
OMG. Iknow what he should name the filly Doctor~
I don't know. I don't know Ponymon.
can we please just stop talking about religon?
Freefall29: bc it comes up and Kandarihu is stopping now I think
sweetie bell evolves into 2 forms
damn you reddit, damn you i say
Aint it weird how RD seems to be the least loyal pony with her friends?
Oh my gosh, What are we getting ourselves into? :D
otakon, Reikim asked a good question.
crusader outfit and soemthign else
hey yo wuts up everypony:)

Hey scout19_tf2
hi scout19_tf2 :)
scout19_tf2: sup bro
let the people have their discussion, it hasnt gone bad yet.
hiya scout19_tf2
lol it's the doctor.
i just wish i had a way to wipe the data from it before plugging it in
WHEN DOES the narwhal bacon?
Or the doc.
hi scout19_tf2
omg this video is getting annoying!
at midnigght
caramel?
Spike's ability to age and regress is rather odd. That brings to question whether they age normally at all.
It's still civil
and wut r we watching today
chhchickenCX: well turn the music down
twilight_sprinkle: its gonna soon... someone is gonna say something stupid and a flame war will happen
Ponymon.
hello
DINKY!
Kinixys: he's gonna live hundreds of years old. it makes sense he ages slower
@rosePetal
Kinixys: I don't think ponies and dragons age like us at all it seems.
I just want a dif. video but i guess ill wait:|
Freefall29: there are barely any religious people here in the first place. plus mods can easily stop it if its out of control
he could just run from the battles...
where can u play dis
chhchickenCX: STream. Not video.
Although the fact that if he starts hoarding he ages quicker but that seems to cause him to become more animalistic
Yeah..
Freefall29, we can't live in fear of morons lest we be censored by their very existance.
Well, you have to level up the ponies. The next gym leader has ponymon that are level 20.
weeping_pegasi82: apparently grinding vies some sort of stat bonus. idk why he needs it in a game without multiplayer tho
Kandarihu: only problem is the morons usually outnumber you.
twilight_sprinkle: to make your ponies strong!
kill the bitch
kill it
BEAT HER WITH BIG MAC!
with fire
BURN HER WITH HELLFIRE
Pokemon requires SO much grinding.
otakon: I was actually wondering if he could control his aging if he could master his inner greed.
and then he went away
otakon: that sounds so wrong on so many levels
With ectra fire!
AJIsAwesome: maybe
**extra
im not a fan of the whole "people are morons" thing at all, because usually it just means that people have a different opinion from yours
Bronysith: goddammit
/me gives otakon whiskey
take a shot
Theres opinion and then theres plain stupidity
AJIsAwesome: he's gonna have to mature sooner or later, if he can control his dragon side is what matters
otakon, I understand. But cowering in fear of them isn't the right thing to do.
I'm back
Freefall29: Since greed triggers aging, will his body be stunted far longer than a one who lives with it's kin?
Almost out of the cave.
sup RAWRity
i mean yeah people are morons, but everyone is a moron, usually when people say "people are stupid" they mean "people disgree with me"
Indeed, TS. There are very few morons. There is a lot of ignorance, and even more disagreement, but very little true, bigoted stupidity.
Welcome bacK RAWRity
lol the irony.
what's otakon cowering from?
http://i.imgur.com/RJodp.gif HOLY CELESTIA ON A UNICYCLE IT IS SWEETIE BELLE
wb RAWRity
twilight_sprinkle: well let me put it this way, out of the BILLIONS of people that have been born, lived and died how many have actually improved our lot in life on a whole? The rare genius' which number maybe in the 1,000's in comparisons.
dis remix stinks
lol.
Bronysith: :D
Kinixys: maybe he might age naturally, just won't be as powerful compared to other dragons.
twilight_sprinkle, having a different opinion is nothing wrong. I don't like it when they shove their views down my throat or accuse me of shoving my views down their throat just because I wanted to share mine.
Sweetie Bear
Bronysith: AAAAAAAAAH! I'm so BORED
Bronysith: always cracks me up
2,14 clearly scout19_tf2 has such a massive appreciation for Brony Appreciation Day
lol maybe that's where they got the idea?
Dark92Enigma: how can you bro bored bro
Oh, I just contradicted myself.
otakon: Implying that one needs genius to improve the human race. Or that not being a genius means you're automatically a moron.
wait it really is carmel
Freefall29: i quoted Sweetie Belle
Really, ota, that entire bit was logically wrong.
I dont mind opinions but if their opinion is blatantly stupid then they're stupid
otakon: well i agree that the average person only cares about themselves. egoism is in our very core at this point in society, every person thinks about themselves 99% of the day. our society is Built on egoism, the belief that everyone is born with the right to anything they want
I personally think religion and science goes hand in hand... in fact, I think some science is a product of religion.
/me resists urge to turn this into a human nature discussion
YES
It depends, if their opinion has a lot of good factual evidence then it's fine. But if it has no evidence then it's just dumb.
Kandarihu: im ok with other opinions too. although logically speaking, there can only be one correct answer to a question
Reikim: well let's put it this way, I'm smarter than a bug but Einstein is smarter than me. Compared to Einstein I'm a moron, compared to a bug I'm a genius. It's all about relativity.
otakon: exactly
the remix just got 20% cooler
caramel: let us choose!
so
twilight_sprinkle, and that's why we debate. In persuit of the truth.
otakon: technically, compared you Einstein, you're average.
Octavia or Vinyl Scratch huh?
otakon: And there's a general scale that most people work on. Einstein is a genius; a bug is a bug; and you are an average person of average intelligence. Really, most people on this earth fall within that middling range.
That means you can have Octavia?
http://tinyurl.com/8o5u27p
yep
Gtg bye guys!:$
Octavia.
Chat derp hold on
Kandarihu: yeah thats why i like to express opinions
bye chhchickenCX
you can't create nothing from something. that's the problem with evolved small celled organism theory.
Octavis for all the class.
lol.

Eyes on Me yay~
interesting song...?
Ponies47: That ep need to be streamed
00,10I want to say 8
Sumica: WHICH ONE...maybe
2,14 jesus scout, if you don't like the music, mute the fucking stream and shut the hell up
Heh. Classical CD. The other is some sort of Dubstep CD or something right?
00,10might be 9
Sumica yep its Eyes on Me
Can't wait for season 3! Why it no come by sooner?
FF8
Caramel: :O
Sumica: enope not it, I recognize that theme by heart
RosePetal, I hope to know that myself.
twilight_sprinkle: let's put it this way. You need to get up a mountain. There's any number of ways to get up to the top. You could climb. You could drive. You could ride a burrow. Plenty of answers, all of them correct.
Freefall29: don't :O him, his stream and it's aggravating to hear about people complain about the content of your stream.
the fuck did i ever do the remix just had a bad beggining
hi
MEga Kick
RAWRity: like i said, there is only one Full COrrect answer. all of the methods should be included in the answer
I'm sensing a tradition with nightly chat activity here.
gotta be AJ
Sketch_Toku_Brony: Join the muffin side @_@
Shame that they can't learn those moves.
If there is more than one answer to a question, then the question was not specific enough.
man i love this song :)
MUFFINS
lol growl .
twilight_sprinkle: you really have no idea how the world works, do you?
Kinixys: well there are almost always different ways to see something
what does TM mean ..oh yeah Technique Machine
oh lawd
FILLYDELPHIA!
*Technical
darn my mother and her computer stealing ways....good night guys
you wanna know the difference between cupcakes and muffins... nothing. a muffin is a bald cupcake.
RAWRity: why does everything that comes out of your mouth have to be so rude and condescending
dam mothers
twilight_sprinkle: no that's Meanwhile
otakon: him too.
Aaand TS brings out the insults, and I'm done.
Freefall29: BALD! BALD! BALD!
00,10incorect Freefall29
twilight_sprinkle: why does everything you type here have to be naive and dismissive?
BALD! MY EYES!
Manechat can hate itself on its own terms tonight.
I wonder if one of the ponymon worlds will be Trottenton.
o_o
/me murders Freefall29
Trottingham
Sumica: that was a stand up comedy reference.... jim gaffigan....
wait
aaaaah, dat ping
Don't give us that look, you ought to know about this by now.
how come R DASH is a Slowbro?
RAWRity: "naive" again, condescension. i didnt dismiss you, i listened to what you said and i answered. after that you just made it personal, theres nothing really to dismiss or not
00,10yeah i know, and any baker will call that joke wrong
Freefall29: Sumica is a baker, he knows what a cupcake and a muffin is
:( song always makes me wanna shed tears of joy...so beautiful
seinfeld: and whats the deal with baldness?
It's a glitch.
Bronysith: I was making a reference
Freefall29: well it backfired
From time to time mane chat gets too drama-ish
Bronysith: aint my fault you didn't get the reference
Oh yeah there's a rival battle on that bridge.
twilight_sprinkle: If a question can be interpreted in different ways, then it was worded too ambiguously.
where can u play dis at
"From time to time"
Freefall29: um, i did get the reference, but no one found it amusing
Freefall29: especially since there is a real baker in the chat
/me Doesn't know why but he downloaded TF2 Beta
Rare candy must of been hiding really quickly.
again talkin 'bout Ts Reikim ?
Not really, not this time.
HELLO EVERYPONY MALK LOVES YOU
i am chchickenCX
Bronysith: how does that matter?
fuck yea
Hi, Malk :)
hiya Malk
Hey Malk
Kinixys: i mean you Can state something perfectly precise and full, but thats very hard, just as there can be only one perfectly precise and full answer, which is also very hard
I've found him more tolerable ever since I managed to beat him.
hey Malk
/me Dances
hi mal
Hiya.
hi Malk
Yes, I saw it as a contest, yes, it is a personality flaw.
*hi Malk
Also just found out where the "Spuddy's, Enough just isn't enough" came from.
YA Im in a good mood
Freefall29: cause then the baker will rip on you for being oh so wrong
hey malk
Malk: Why?
wus up Malk
Anyway, I'm more lamenting the general crappiness of manechat.
Malk: good for you :)
feeling that I've missed something
D:
FLUTTERSHY!
it seems they didnt fix the sprites
03uh
03oh
KILL HER
otakon: Where?
Tis Fluttershy.
Bronysith: ok Bronysith.... I think the baker is an intelligent person, who is capable of understanding a joke from the reference I made.
Crap don't use THE STARE!
03you mean an enclosure
Fluttershy! <3
aji: stream
Just ate the best dinner I ever had and had a great day so
Malk: well i can say im doing alright too, got a job interview soon
Nice.
Just know that manechat is no longer fun.
Freefall29: dat double ping fail
Fake tears.
Kinixys: like lets say i ask you what color is your pencil, and you answer yellow, would you think thats precise enough?
FAKE TEARS?
Brb

TRIXIE?
00,10so she is huging fluttershy and throwing rocks in her face
USE TWILIGHT!
Bronysith: agreed
otakon: Where did the Spuddies catchphrase come from?
That, or I've just become properly cognizant of the perpetual petty struggles and lack of a positive, friendly atmosphere.
What is being streamed?
Malk: thanks
Malk: Ponymon.
Ponymon.
00,10dat ff10
AJIsAwesome: The movie called "The Stuff" it was a horror comedy

Okay. Thanks.
08,01i've almost got 3d acceleration working in X11 on my tablet, i think!
to be honest, I don't really hate silver spoon.
Freefall29: Me neither.
silver spoon is my fav non cmc filly
I kind of wish Saxy were here just so I could get him to BUSTAH WOLF me.
HOORAY FOR CIVILITY!
Time spent on internet is directly proportional to jerkness
08,01i think all i need now is the appropriate kernel module
aww shit, Frog be in the place
holy shit....

Freefall29: It's just D Tiara I hate.
FROG!

GODDAMMIT!
YES THIS SONG DOES KICK ASS!
I haven't played Chrono Trigger. :$
manliest Frog ever
Lately, Silver Spoon has not been doing anything with Diamond Tiara. Does this mean by season 3 she'll be the good guy?
Ah, I wouldn't recognize it as Frog's theme until that Flute-like instrument kicks in
AJIsAwesome: play it
Kandarihu: for shame
Freefall29: I'll try.
AJIsAwesome: PLAY.IT.
otakon: Alright.
AJIsAwesome: its one of my favorite RPG's of all time. do it. for real. do it
Okay.
one of my friends said the ending boss strikes an attack that kills the whole crew in one shot, so im not gonna bother playing it
Frog is probably one of the most manly of men.
Got kicked again?
Yes they did it!

twilight_sprinkle: D:
It would be great if Inside Freeman's Mind catches on to fan-parodies like "Inside Red's Mind" or "Inside Crono's Mind" or "Inside Link's Mind"
Go ponyball!
Berry used INTOXICATED BREATH! You are now confused!
Reikim: Oak said "i forgot if you were a boy or girl", so Red had t ohave explained somehow...
Kandarihu: nope
Hooray!

Stuff liek Steam has me spending my money like it's on fire.
And now main's going to get flooded with video links!

oni_link: that, and there was the AVGN episode.
DJ_POn-3: no it wasn't
00,02and steam is heading to linux
action 52 was an awesome episode.
otakon: Most of whom record shows consisting of a static camera locked in at too far away and giving us snide reviews, usually delivered by an obese neckbeard.
Freefall29: Yeah, but I learned about that song because of chiptunes :P so yeah
DocSane: well NC is funnier dammit
avgn vs NC. GO!
i like both.
i have to agree with otakon
also http://www.indieroyale.com/
Title on www.indieroyale.com: The Back to School Bundle - Indie Royale
any news of james rolfe's movie?
both are awesome. I can't decide
Im with ya AJIsAwesome
I prefer NC over AVGN, but I like both.
enope
Dken2021: I think the shooting is done. editing is left
I like HVGN too
He makes me happy
otakon: I like Nostalgia Chick's more analysis-based offerings.
lol
otakon: Oh, DEFINITELY him.
DocSane: yeah true
I have to be in the mood to watch AVGN
And it doesn't happen very often
happy video game nerd gave earthbound a 20 minute episode.... I can respect him for that.
otakon: Does AVGN even do the AVGN stuff anymore?
I like Mikes stuff too
Wirisme: sometimes i have to be in the mood to watch mlp
DocSane: every once in a while
superretroworld: here's the link to the review .......go to 09:30 and you'll find the name-less song i'm TRYING to find http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8QiPcfzIEQ
I like him as well
or this one http://www.gamersgate.com/indiefort-bundle?aff=ggnews
Title on www.gamersgate.com: IndieFort Bundle No 3 - GamersGate - Buy and download games for PC now
As do I, otakon.
otakon: Linkara annoys me. He's so damn one-note.
He gives very blunt, honest reviews.
lol LadyCanary you only like him for the jacket
Nahhhh.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ4AictvRdU
otakon: its a sexy jacket
DocSane: Sage and Film Braina and Welshy amuse me
I actually do watch his reviews. OMG FILM BRAIN.
<3
Film Brain is fun.
SYMBOLISM!!!!!
yeah Film Brain
Yeah i like FB
god earthbound.... having a nerdgasm here
Freefall29: so GOOD
so much NOSTALGIA
ah yes, matthew buck is interesting sometimes
Bunny Must Die?
And I'm one of those odd people who really think that Nella is damn funny.
and SUCH AN EPIC CLIMAX
But my new favorite reviewer? Diamanda the Lecher bitch Hagan <3
I got that ages ago.
It's pretty damn hard.
Diamanda scares me.
LadyCanary: that ...woman...*gulp*
^
Well now I'm happy. Edy's Pumpkin ice cream is back in stores
yay?
I freaking LOVE her.
LadyCanary: you have strange tastes
I don't really get it, I watch the NC crossover thing, it just seemed weird
but I think that's why we like you
nintendo... y u no release earthbound in japan....
I really like her ^_^
For anyone who didn't understand my "Banning of Dihydrogen Monoxide" joke, http://www.snopes.com/science/dhmo.asp
But a good game all around.
Kandarihu: you mean H2O?
Dark92Enigma: when does he mention the bronies?
Kandarihu: aka water?
otakon, you got it right.
yeah I get the joke
AJIsAwesome same here, even when i like both NC and AVGN i find myself more familiar with the former, because even if i did play some nostalgic videogames, i've watched more nostalgic shows
kind of like how 78 out of 100 people asked on the street thought heterosexual was homosexual and vice versa
lol
Little Nemo
God I remember that game
SO GODDAMN HARD
but so good too
00,02dont really want to have another game service thing but that one does suport linux
I LOVE Little Nemo.

That might be blasphemy but for me it's true.

Wirisme: thats ok... least he didn't join the hater bandwagon
Goddammit
/me loads agonizingly slowly
It's funny how Lindsey seems to studiously avoid talkign about FiM, except for one small mention.
Why is YT loading so damn slowly for me?
yes
He also made a big deal about the gender thing
Sorry, my ISP cut out, I've been forced to route my connection through Otanet.
13are you still using neighbor wifi?
otakon: delete ALL THE COOKIES
Shizuka: ...yes.
13that's why
i give up
Because you hold internet that is crap otakon.
i can't get the hard drive into my computer XD
Wirisme: I thought his Ask That Guy segment about FiM was hilarious.
Shizuka: every thing else is loading fine BUT Youtube videos
aaw shiet, frenchies are kicking our arse
the power supply cord isn't agreeing with me
I didn't see that, which part is it?
also just cleared cookies last night
Wirisme: I can't remember. It was months and months ago.
I'll just ctrl f the comments then lol
Wirisme: The question was "Twilight Sparkle or Rainbow Dash." He went on to give a hilariously detailed and well-argued answer.
lol
are these blue shift and opposing force games worth it or are they like the invisible wars of halflife?
gotta see this
DocSane: oh yeah.. that was funny
Shizuka: how about just one that's embedded in another site?
13still youtube
Buytoast: do you mind it was made by gearbox not valve?
*sigh* can someone ping me when something happens please?
seriously it shouldn't take over 20 minutes to load a 10 minute video
Wirisme: I think it was Episode 63.
Yup confirmed
goddamn shitty Youtube
13you're leeching wifi from a neighbor
13it's not youtube's fault
weeping_pegasi82 like......letting you know you been pinged?
aren't they the people that made Borderlands and the sequel Redditland 2?
Shizuka: it is youtube's fault, my tablets don't have this issue
nevermind I'll just check in once and a while
13beggars can't be choosers
Buytoast: opposing force is worth it, awesome game. blue shift is.... meh. get it if you want. blue shift is short and adds little new content
Shizuka: true
Shizuka: thats harsh lol

Bye, all. I make it a policy not to watch this episode.
what if doctor who was real that kick so much flank
Malk, that's not true
is feeling very sad right now
Or rather, someone noobier than me.
13canary canary <3
flutterchu: Why?
We need to get one big BState questing party together and wreck shit.
Kandarihu that how police where I am is
Dark92Enigma: wow, bronies are so powerful you dont need a passport xD
Scary O.O
Shizu Shizu :3
So I left off on the 8th episode on the First season of 2005
oh gosh that episode
Hope they'll get Guesting soon
Guesting?
so we got ourselves a vlogger
AJIsAwesome: i just made my second wallpaper......it took me 2 days and no one likes it
Like, guesting from other servers
I know server transfer is free atm
Malk: yeah. its different here... if the police lay a hand on someone... even if they deserved the crap kicked out of them... they get their asses sued.
flutterchu: show me i will like it
flutterchu: I wanna see
flutterchu: It's just two days. Give it more time.
Malk, do you live in Houston?
but still, I'd rather not jump servers too often, you'd never know when it's not free anymore
flutterchu, link please?
flutterchu: just for u pal :) <3
Frefall29 where do you live?
superretroworld: True that, we ARE his passport

Dark92Enigma: so is he a brony then?
THE HORROR!
Malk: doesn't matter. police "brutality" happens all over the country
SOmehow
God I hate being underleveled.
THE HORROR!"
O.O
i will like in a minute i need to sign in
that's no plane
IT'S A SPACE SHIP!
This is why Trix needs to get GW2 and stat
Police are often falsely accused of brutality too.
Freefall29 its not Brutality its law enforcement
BOOM, the Dcotor.
Kandarihu I know
At this point I'd gtfo of London
Moaning Myrtle?
moaning myrtle!
URSULA :'(
Malk: well, brutality is used quite often here.
Malk: the term atleast
yeah I remember this one now
Man this is major spoliers for me but screw it!
aka soccer
turtles?
i have a midly addiction to MMO, what lvl are you ?
I can't believe Moaning Myrtle's actress is middle aged o_O
Freefall29 Is beating up a criminal trying to run brutality?
YES!
ELO!
ELO>3
Good choice man
<3
I LOVE THIS SONG.
E.L.O.!
aw yeah
I like this
nice dancing :D
Occupy Wall Street have made falsely accusing the police of brutality into an artform, if something so sordid can be called art.
hmmm
Bye, everypony!
Well, not exactly middle aged
...
Bye, Kinixys :)
more elo fans, thats like 6 now
They dont make music like they used to
pondering if i should use comodo firewall XD
That's not how Internet has a meltdown
XD
Bye, Kinixys!
03ew firewalls
bye Kinixys :)
no his PC had a meltdown
bye Kinixys
Malk: there have been cases before where police chased down a criminal and called it brutality. its not uncommon.
03er
03http://toastytech.com/guis/win8.html
AND he's still going
pff
Kandarihu well most of it was over reation but they actually did have abuses on certain protestors
I'm not a big fan of ELO, but I haven't heard a song by them I haven't loved.
Dat voice...
I know it
that voice
wait
that's MOANING MRYTLE
THE DOCTOR
I don't know ELO at all but I like that
O_O
You kidding? That's Shirley Henderson.

otakon: yeah i just realized that too :D
yeah that's Myrtle
Skinner!

HUR HUR HUR
Can't unhear myrtle
Bye AJIsAwesome, Polydunami, oni_link, thelonepony, twilight_sprinkle.

Guess what? Moaning Myrtle is forty years of age there.
is dr. who supposed to talk into the camera he was recording, or is this for a specific doctor?
bye Kin......gone
Well, her actress is.
This year, they're popping balloons in front of cops to make them jumpy. They WANT this narrative about the police being brutal to a "peaceful" group of demonstrators.
im am back wut happend
SO............MOANING MYRTLE
doctor who happened
scout19_tf2: wb Val frustration quit and we're watching Dr. Who
Pfft
Kandarihu: ugh..... why.....
13i miss being able to buy things
Dammit
flutterchu: liked ur wallpaper
aha, a geeky fan club
Doctor is one hell of a mythical symbol.
You do realize why he's talking like that don't you?
-*knock knock* -Who's there? -Doctor...
Poor bastards
Kandarihu well the I wouldnt call brutality but the real corruption happended at the primaries for the republican election
...Torchwood?
N
Freefall29, they want to be seen as martyrs. They want the moral high ground.
Dken2021: comes later
LINDA!
Malk, I saw the primaries. I didn't see any corruption there.
and one thing.... don't let me eat pears.... I hate pears.
lol
-Doctor who? -Exactly
Is that... Michael?
Hi guys
they became friends
Did the Doctor always have an aversion to pears? Just wondering.
hiya XylemTube
Freefall29: did they make more of that mini series
best. group. ever.
Hi, XylemTube :)
Hey there, XylemTube
weeping_pegasi82: it's a shame what happened to them :(

poor Bliss
Freefall29: bc

Freefall29: Money?

Freefall29 what do you think all crazed fans do?
that moment when you enter an area where almost everything is immune to burning, and your build is based around burning stuff
Eulshy: Doctor Who
Kandarihu sorry not delegate I mean chairman of the election for the whole state
Freefall29: or maybe collect HIM as part of a collection
:|

DJ_POn-3 which one?

I'm still not past the First Doctor era. William Hartnell.
weeping_pegasi82: I havent seen this far so this is spoilers but IDC XD
I've only seen it on this stream
step 2
done
Added an extra 2 there unconsciously because of instinctual shame.
brb
If I haven't known this was the real dr. who I would have thought this was a parody
Too bad many of the first and second doctors' episodes are lost forever
XylemTube: I'd say B
step 3 done

00,10she's in the class
Dr. Who in general is awesome

Especially not the one that keeps this place functioning...
Nittany: I'd like to believe that. But see, there's this "trend" at EA of studio heads leaving "on good terms" and all
This is a decent episdoe
speaking of Bioware didnt they make ME3? If so,is the ending really THAT bad?
missing kids?
10You don't usually get paid for internships here
And by trend I mean basically every studio
its the magic pencil!
oh GOD
lets solve a mistery gang
well that was horrifying
oh YES
Oh lawd.
This seems awfully contrived.
Sumica: 9th? or 10th?

Tell her to draw ponies

LadyCanary: Just For Kids was a kid's show producer, think 4Kids today. They dubbed a LOT of anime back in the late 80's early 90's I had a WHOLE bunch of their videos and saw much anime from them.
ugh
Ahhhhhh I see.
I never knew they produced the "safe" version of Project A-Ko
which was the first verison I saw
No.. Not even Speed Racer actually. It was some anime adaptation of a story from Arabian Nights, which was Aladdin.
honestly not much was cut

twilight_sprinkle: otakon has been kicked 12 times
Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: New York Comic Con Plans My Little Pony Panel
so there's not too much cash in the game
why do we need 6 kick bots active?
lol
they go one after the goddamn other
otakon: become an oper: become immune
:p
MakerDusk: -_____________-
Actually otakon the kick bot noticed you weren't affected by netsplit and it had to fix that major error.
00,10mine is active cause side rooms otakon
personally, I think we need to double the number of kickbots
00,10the rest of them I have no clue
OneTrickPony: Make that triple. :D
Poor Feldt ;3;
OneTrickPony: but I already get kick attemps from a few of them
guy with ponytail:D

I'm just confused
AJIsAwesome: yes XD
00,10I would get rid of mine if we ever get BerryPunch to stick around and work in all rooms
more bots mean more fail
Sumica: what side rooms they are all closed

Barbetos: not usually, this show is an exceptiong
00,10hehe silly LadyCanary
PaladinDrakkenwolf: that one little girl..yeah I saw a bit of it
the game server right when I was about to finish one of the personal storyline thingies
so he has a license to kill?
I am not silly! I want oooooone ;3;
Haro is a multipurpose robot/database/Ai unit, used throught most Gundame series as a combination backup unit and comic relief-- and most Gundam NEEDS some comic relief.
means I'll have to start it over again
otakon: some1 at Gearbox is a Brony
PaladinDrakkenwolf: which one? havent played the game yet
LadyCanary: you are silly and that's why we love you :)
Vhat is dis?

oh ok
....FUCK YOU AL-SAACHEZ. FUCK YOUUUUU
Al-Saachez?
The fucker in the mech.
LadyCanary: calm yo-self
LadyCanary: I guessed that why you hate him?
NocturnalBlade: theres this character in Borderlands 2 that resembles Pinkamena, she's named Mina I believe and she like luring people to fake tea times parties that she has with inanimate objects where she blows them up with TNT
I'm not sure I understand...
PaladinDrakkenwolf: yeah but it's just bandits
otakon: No....because he KILLED SETSUNA'S family. ;3;
ah
well im hooked
and who is Setsuna again?
PaladinDrakkenwolf: ...wow, i wanna play it so bad now XD
well I'm not
bc these goddamn names are ALL over the place

idiots
lol phase4 dnt know wuts goin on
otakon: no wonder you like ttgl ;)
morons i mean really instead of SURROUNDING him

Also: if you die, keep trying.

Theoretical physicists these days.

I'd have it so we surrounde it from all sides
But then you wouldn't be fighting, you'd be running. :P

true but id survive
it'll eventually get through
No really this portion sucks.

He has so much emotion in his voice.

well so much for the melee units
ikr
13way i did it is toss a grenade at the two doors to blow away the boards, then just rush in and hope to not take too much damage
00,02gundamn style
I did more or less that.
scout19_tf2: they're fighting gundams it's like sending soliders in padded armor against fully armored knights in heavy plate
why is the twilight chat tricked out but no other pony
Tossed charges and detonated them when the tentacles got frisky.
derpy56: no idea
Oppan Gundam Style~

WildRepublicGuard: its not bad...a little different from the second thats for sure lol
00,10but at least they used clean samples
weeping_pegasi82 you should look imagine dragons up
Sumica, indeed and it didn't tried hard

Incomprehensible song incoming.
Not Code Geass
damn that's chump change in the grand scheme of things
Yes code geass. best anime
no

Cowboy Bebop is that
OH GAWD MY UNCLES RING TONE FOR 7 years
One Piece. Best anime, and it LASTS
COWBOY BEBOP
math?
cowboy beepop? pfffnah
Kandarihu: great show
Go to my anime list . net and look up mitamaking, anything I rated a 9 or 10 is good
One Piece is great
^
No filler
lots of interesting characters
code geass has no filler either, every ep changes the story
and fantastic action scense
twilight_sprinkle: Not like Cowboy Bebop, but like Code Geass, hahahahaha
Well, it DOES have filler, but it almost never gets out of hand
I've watched Death Note, Ouran Host Club, and both FMA's(I just got into the anime game)
weeping_pegasi82: i heard Black Butler is a good one
mitamaking: oh please, deathnote fanboy
the random anime is over o3o
Kandarihu: yeah but it's not pointless filler

hi Canadian_Brony
Hi Canadian_Brony :)

I approve of this PMV
Your right, the show is better if we all worship Light twilight_sprinkle :)
hiya Canadian_Brony
hey Canadian_Brony
Well, there were those Grand Jipangu specials.
mitamaking: 1. light sucks 2. code geass is better
o hai Canadian_Brony
I'll make a man out of you.
love this
hai Canadian_Brony
42!
Let us not do this again
mitamaking: code geass wasnt even that interesting, i barely forced myself through the first 9 episdoes, and after L died it got very bad, with tons of plot holes
mitamaking: youre the one who started it
Be a Mare!
twilight_sprinkle: spoilers man
twilight_sprinkle: what?
Man I wanna watch Mulan now
twilight_sprinkle: the hell you should know better
Wana Watch Mulan Now
Mulan now
no demands
mitamaking: i didnt complain about your choices, but you started going "codegeass sucks blabla ps.imadeathnotefanboy"
Uh, getting Death Note and Code Geass mixed up?
otakon but the true question is what is the ultimate question to the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything?
WELL?
fine
Canadian_Brony: 6x7 ofc
otakon:
twilight_sprinkle: you make no sense
twilight_sprinkle: still spoilers so don't even try it
HAX!!!!
I KNOW ALL!
otakon: *sorry, didnt think anyone here currently would be interested in watching it anyway
MUHAHAHAHAH
twilight_sprinkle: well no but spoilers are spoilers
Candian_Brony because the main question is within reach but we cannot comprehend it
The MOOOONNNA
Be a man
/me has chills
otakon O RLY? What are my 3 aliases?
weeping_pegasi82: death note fans hate code geass because they think code geass ripped of the main character, which is bullshit
Code Geass interested me. I liked it. DeathNote, on the other hoof, bored me to hades.
Mysterious as the dark side of the mooooooon
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
that was awesom
(beeyetch)
Kencolt: ikr. it wasnt even that clever
twilight_sparkle: so which one was first?
You know what? I liked both Death Note and Code Geass
Canadian_Brony: Woulda Shoulda and Coulda
Teach English
haha
replace english with music
lol
otakon . . . you don't know everything.
the way light..did it, i thought of 10 episodes before he did, and nothing was stopping him from doing it earlier
Canadian_Brony: blargh
lol
hah
I like Code Geass and Death Note. I prefer Code Geass because it interested me more, but Death Note is still a good anime to me.
Stumped, eh
weeping_pegasi82: doesnt even matter because theyre not the same
?
Canadian_Brony: eh I don't care
Oh this is Avenue Z
sounds about right for me

How do you tell someone that you've always been afraid of them and wanted to get away when you always used to act like you loved them because you were too afraid to admit it to yourself?

he's sadly dead
Thanks
Can't remember the episode that made me a brony.
You win
I feel better
XD
Well I thought the show was weak early, then Flutterguy
This... is Amazing! :D
Sonic Rainboom was my first episode
Watchu talkin' bout willis?
so I guess that converted me
I think my first ep was Party of One
00,10I did't know what a brony was till I finished s1
the song winter wrap up got me interested
I found out about bronies on The Escapist
Sumica: Same! lol
hurrincane fluttershy was my first episode
Opening song?
I asked why so many people had ponies as their avatar
THE MOON!
otakon: you fool
oh, I know this one . . .
Oh God the nostalgia
mitamaking: I know I know
Moonbase song
umm
Found about bronies via Know Your Meme episode.
God I love this
otakon: Well, watching a cute, candy-colored pony decsend into the depths of insanity will make anyone curious...
hmm
AJ Is Awesome
So beautiful
;_;
It was after Doug Walker mentioned them on his Q&A vid, so I decided to see what the fuss was about
To be honest, KYM didn't really give a good example of bronies.
my friend kept linking me pony stuff, which surprised me because i didnt think he was into cute stuff. so i started watching from the beginning, so no first ep for me i guess. i almost quit after the 3rd ep too
But of course Family Appreciation Day is there for our weekly CMC or Fluttershy episode
and chat pulled a big ol derp on me!
wb NocturnalBlade
ahem NocturnalBlade1
I found out about bronies via DEATH BATTLE!!! and an awesome friend I didn't know was a brony until almost a year of knowing him.
NocturnalBlade1: just ghost the old nick
Then I heard about them through a YTP news show that I used to watch.
I watched pony eps. Worried i was the only one. Looked up pony stuff. Found EqD. and it linked me here :D
MORE GITS!
moar GITS
AJIsAwesome I became a brony by watching MLP with my 4 year old cusin she loves it a little more than me though
otakon: how?
twilight_sprinkle: I know that feel, I didn't watch any episodes for about 5 months between episode 2 and 3
why
And i was welcome by many when i got here! Most of which are gone now.... :(
*welcomed
IIRC, my first brony encounter was watching the first annual Indie Games for Good marathon. The guys there were bronies. However, I might've known about this since earlier.
RaveBrony: not really
EQD got me here too
otakon: i dont think i have a password XD
yeah EqD got me here too
then last April, I watched all of Season 1 in a single school night.
NocturnalBlade1: well hold on
mitamaking: yeah they were very predictable, especially the 3rd one, 30 seconds in i knew what would happen, how, and the ending
otakon: Well, they dont chat in 'here' anymore. I know where they went :D
My response to the fandom kept switching from negative to neutral as I saw the fandom grow. I even saw some of my favorite video games sped run by bronies.
ah
just in time for Ghost in the Shell
Me? I just noted articales, and memes, and stuff... and I had the HUB, on my cable, so I decided to give it a chance. After a couple of days, I heard most eps were on YouTube. After that, well... no going back.
Welp, im off to Minecraft with a RL friend of mine
I WONDER
And that's how Pinkie Pie got her cutie mark! Maybe someday I'll tell you how I became a brony
indeed hiya flutter_spin

Discord-Drocsid: nice

Come to think of it, there was an AMV Hell Minis episode dedicated to western animation. There were some FiM clips from there, and I was only recently aware of the brony movement back then.
hiya flutter_spin imma go read that some time soon
Discord-Drocsid: bc he's a guest star
FINALLY!
Discord-Drocsid: He is being worshipped by bronies

Wait, I thought the helicopter episode was in season 2
Discord-Drocsid: who knows maybe

Wow my story is lame.. "I decided to check it out and I liked it"
:(
DAMN
holy shit
Wirisme: its ok *hug*

flutter_spin: long time
Canadian_Brony: yep
Spider tanks :3
I went through something very drastic that kept me in a dark depression a while back, and out of curiosity (and guilting myself), I decided to give the show a chance. However, I didn't watch every episode in one night like most people did. It took me about a week t finish all the episodes and by the time Mystery On th Friendship Express came out I loved the show.
mitamaking, yes, it's this episode.
The 25 minutes of Tachcoma talk
AJIsAwesome: it helped didn't it?
otakon: Yep. :D
This guy just keeps somehow crawling back into my life when I think I've escaped
running now
otakon: Yeah. Why am I not surprised she tells me to hold onto the bills until money comes in.
If you thought you hated this show before...
someone you know?
otakon: MLP got me through my exams last semester
Yea
if not for MLP I'd be a total dick
since atm I'm out of work and no luck finding a job
otakon: I'm not sure. I really like the community and projects that come up related to mlp. The show is more of an attachment, like me watching Dr. Who right now
Mlp got me out of my depression
hmm
Canadian_Brony: So like you are now?
that thing?
:p
If it wasn't for this show I would've been MUCH MORE depressed than I usually was. I would've probably been in a mental hospital.
:$
O_o
MLP always cheers me up
-pokes the chat randomly-
online?
Adorable :3
I dont think i would have the girlfriend i have right now if not for FiM
Wirisme I just like kids im not in a sick way
wait, isn't this the episode entirely devoted to the tanks AI?

Which messenger is this on?
I probably got some of it wrong too
3.14 is all i bothered to remember
mitamaking . . . very funny. I mean I'd be almost completely anti-social and a not as close to my sister than I am today. In other words, I'd be a stereotypical teenager.
mitamaking: well as far as I know the first three numbers are always 3.14 and the rest of the numbers are usually random

Miki yes you would forget her
I don't use Gaia so I don't know what options are available for that
Poor Miki
Such Intelegent Trolls

Sumica: is the Major's most likely
Yea, but somehow he magically still talks to me. it's really fucking weird
i found the pinkie bot :D
If he is then you didnt set the settings correctly
nothing like that feeling when you see that your homework isnt actually due tomorrow
THank Gawd they dont know what a strike is
:( <----Later
Ive changed the settings myself before to block some people from messaging me
twilight_sprinkle: the gift of time!
"Don't think about your target"
twilight_sprinkle: eeyup
GLock
that is terrible advice
For MSN there should be an option to Only allow your contacts on your buddy list to message you
They feel sorry for it I think
If the guy is on your contact list after you change it then delete his name
dont block him, just remove the name
Well, bed time. Good night everypony! Take care :)

I'd need to hear it a few times, perhaps
I can't brain today I haz teh dumb

too many fancy words :\

so do they hate the spiderbots or something?
naaaailed it lol
Buytoast: no they're worried about them becoming sapient
Pinkie Pie tanks
2 days later: im afraid i cant do that, Major
They are learning. Fear them.
This is why she is against them right here
Chitti's take on God is more sensible than the Tachikomas.
hmmm
robot can read lips...seems legit
^^
she knows.

ofc she knows
she's the Major

sly woman
13hey.. i'm not beating them up on the sly anymore >>
00,10I could never do that
bye Maid_RainBow
But - but with their minds they could talk MUCH faster
Sumica: me neither I don't think
00,10would need a computer brain
:(
Yay!!!
Lonko: yeah but it only goes as fast as the circuits can process
i think i can do it to a small extent
13it's probably fairly simple for the major, build what you want to say, swap out some words, send one string to your mouth, the other to the comm
now if the Tachikoma is really smart
otakon: They have artificially enahcned brain process function
Shizuka: well she IS The Major I'm surprised you don't like her more.
Shizuka: don't forget. She can dive while driving a car.
13the tachikoma probably doesn't know that room is so shielded, or else doesn't think that's a factor
00,02Comrads
13awwwwwww i missed the chat episode?
yeah
13i love that one
Shizuka: I don't think so
0,14still never really understood why the Tachikomas had to get lobotomised...
The chat episode is cool
totally
a'ww and then Batou feels like shit
I wonder why they never did a proper 3rd season
Now this part is kind of sad
Lonko: Some day
Shizuka: the one where they were talking about the murderer? dont know if that was streamed today, but it was stream a while ago
SaxyPretender: they can't have weapons with free will
Its like killing children
hmm whats on next xP
WHy Batou Must we kill our children?
13SaxyPretender: they're weapons first, AIs second, so because they're developing AI stuff too fast and thinking about non-weapon things, there's a risk they'll think about death when they need to be thinking shoot this guy
You can't grammar like that music.
SaxyPretender: would you want a nuclear bomb to decide which targets it should take out and it decides WE'RE the threat.
Lonko: The director has said within the last year, he will do it someday, he is doing Re:Cyborg 009 now though
coool
mitamaking: He is?
YES!
I LOVED CYBORG 009!
0,14I suppose so, I'm guessing dumping the AI core somewhere else with no access to military systems wouldn't fly in this universe?
SaxyPretender: have you ever seen the space odyssey 2001? its basically a classical robot goes nuts and disobeys orders thing
Don't get your hopes up, it may happen, it may not
REALLY? A 3rd Gig of GitS SAC?

night, Ponies47
mst3k?
00,02Shizuka, why dont things just assume everything is utf-8 unless it finds evidence otherwise
Phase4 challenge accepted. Tomorrow, I will make crazy shit that (hopefully) fies
13iunno
*flies
13ascii is so simple though
g'night Ponies47
13take one byte, interpret char
13unicode is like take one byte... or two... or four..
/me hugs Shizuka
13anyway back to code
/me boops kirzstryfe
/me throws a muffin at Shammy
00,02Shizuka, utf-8 is variable length, first 127 codepoints are the same as ascii and take one byte
13e accent must not be in there, or else everyone that uses e accent uses something further up
13cause it's always the simple accented characters that trigger encoding bugs
Precious
13based on the novel Push by Sapphire, which was also made into a movie
he disapoofe
*disapoofed
sushi
yum
so quiet suddenly
00,02wait, cant the bad guy talk to him through that ring?
man, Smeagol's looking rough
Eww
ugh
everypony's become entranced by the stream
13i think the idea is the one ring is basically sauron's horcrux
i don't think sauron is wake yet or something
13so exerts influence but isn't like a direct conduit
0,14yeah, it's something like that
either that or the ring is just saying fuck you ya greasy ol slobberknocker
00,02Shizuka, true but how long has golum been around with the ring?
13i forget
like 500 years
Shizuka: more or less, yes. And it fills everyone with a near irresistable thrist to posses it.
00,02its some absurd number
0,14though one can claim the power of the ring for themselves, and then....
hundreds of years I think
a long time
00,02Buytoast, sounds right
13yeah 500 sounds right, somewhere between 3 and 5
00,02surely he could have influenced gollum to bring him the ring
Precious
00,02i meen if the big evil guy wants to be an idiot and loose i'm not complaining
13having not read the proper books i wonder if the killing of smaug was the catalyst that brings sauron back to power
Phase4: it doesn't really do that. Just makes EVERYONE want it. It's a metaphor for the corruption of ultimate power.
Mid day?
SILLY
0,14don't think that's the case
13actually
Shizuka: I haven't read the Silmarilion, so I'm not sure.
LIAR
13the opening cinematic from fellowship notes the ring decided to leave gollum, but bilbo intercepted it
hey everypony whats up
don't recall it being mentioned in the books.
I didn't read the books. I never plan on reading the books. And now my school has started a J. R. Tolkien club
MOOPY WOOPY HI
hi Moopy
13so might just have been that sauron slowly built up prior to the hobbit, the ring was ready to go but got stuck
hey dude
0,14also, fun fact for those who don't know, but Sauron actually works for something much bigger than he
h Moopy. WAZZUP
wazzup dude
hey Moopy
been about 5 years since i reead the hobbit
hey weeping
SaxyPretender: Morgoth?
13lord of the rings is horribly dense... tolkien needs to learn about paragraph breaks
00,02speaking of which, any news on the hobbit movie?
Buytoast: well now you cant just wait to watch the movies
0,14think so, Spectrum_Rush
eh
Sauron is mentioned in passing in The Hobbit, as "a dark force growing at the southern end of Mirkwood"
13also yes rawr this is the normal version, i don't have any of the extendeds
00,02Shizuka, he needs to learn to not have prologs that could form stories on their own
Shizuka: you should try the unabridged version
Phase4: well, the comic-on exclusive footage leaked, and there's a trailer due out today.
Moopy you know, watching the stream and nomming a muffin.
i'll probably see em 10 years after they come out
like i did with these films
*comic-con
hehehehe thats good
my mum grabbed a damp cloth she forgot about since sunday and started wiping the counters with it
XD
out came hundreds of teeny tiny mosquitos
Ahh lord of the rings good movie its always good
omg
/me to find out about Sauron during the hobbit, look up The Necromancer
"Young"
i'm a mass murderer
Spectrum_Rush: which is going to be covered in the Hobbit movies, apparently
but he is a tree, so . . .
my sister watched the extended version and then the extended version WITH the commentary the whole thing
13the upper decker thing must be a reference i don't get
i would freak out if that happened
13unless it's something simple like stuffing a toilet with toilet paper
haha

Okay.
you can find a free version if you look for it, I don't have a link for it

totally the saxiest :D
Hi, Ninjazz :)
ni Ninjazz
I'm always missing some sort of net split. There was an instant earlier today that I missed :S
SaxyPretender: whatever you do, stay away from bearded men with glasses
SaxyPretender: nothing good can happen.
0,14Duly noted
And if you see a pony, hug it.
also, if you see any girls with blue hair, best to stay in the friend zone...
0,14ha, I do that to myself already
just, uh, trust me on that one.
If you see a German red head, however, go for it.
13>>
13<<
>_>
huh kinda reminds me of the New Londo Ruins from Dark Souls
0,14Will do, Ninjazz
SaxyPretender: also, stay out of coma patients' rooms.
for OUR sakes.
0,14Any other words of advice?
You make us proud, Saxy.
SaxyPretender: Also, if you plan on taking a walk in the woods, take $20 with you.
13and if you wake up on a blooded beach with said german redhead
German RedheAD???
13don't try to choke her or she'll kill you
SaxyPretender: CONGRATULATIONS!
I'm german, so german Readheads concern me
SaxyPretender: Kangaroos cant jump backwards
SaxyPretender: I have one... just can't say it in chat though :S
0,14Why would I choke someone?
Shizuka: maybe. Sort of. We're not entirely sure on that one.
/me is a german redhead
Shizuka, have they release Eva Rebuild 3 yet?
13supposedly out this fall, but if rebuild 2 is anything to go by we won't see the dvd til next year at best
:(
Are these commentators coming up with those lines on the go or are these cut together
canned material
Lonko, it's live
kirzstryfe: Somehow I would doub that
13i assume they record it all at once, but some of it is probably planned beforehand
0,14...but I have to the train to school!
Lonko: They're working from a script
13i saw a behind the scenes of mst3k once and they watch the movie a couple times to work out where the best jokes would go
SaxyPretender: ...you poor bastard.
13for timing and such
Thank you, Global.
You can come up only with so many witty lines. Not even Aaron Sorkin could pull that off
Shizuka: have you ever seen the live MST3Ks they do?
13nope
they're pretty neat.
0,14also, A BORIA TOWER HAS BEEN DESTROYED
SaxyPretender: If you see a blonde kid, a redhead, a man with a limp, and a dog walking along the tracks, IGNORE THEM.
So that means were gonna go with out stuff?
0,14see..
Is this the theatrical or the extended version? Just a small wonder.
0,14funny you mention that, aji
they often prepare/introduce jokes before the relevant act even shows up
"Minas Tirith calls for a house party!"
13theatrical
remembers FG's scene of this lol
0,14** AJIsAwesome
Hmm?
13now i know that last bit is a king of the hill reference
Nice.
0,14and then a wild dog came out of a tunnel
0,14one of the group I was in told me it was my spirit animal
inb4 Where was Gondor
Hmm, sounds very interesting.
13but i'm dungeon master :<
Wish I had one of those dreams.
actually kirzstryfe you were inafta
0,14never said it was trying to kill me >.>
I'm quite enjoying this :D
i once had a dream where i was fighting against 20 others for the chance to win a chost pirate ship and blow up the island where everyone lived
oh, right
i lost
there'll always be another where was gondor joke :P
but then it warped into some wierd ass shit with dinosaurs
13again gandalf's plan was to get to gondor THEN tell rohan to come... but iirc the beacons take three days to get from gondor to rohan
13so if theoden is going to war on the third day FROM THERE
I assume this is what the gathering for GamesCom 2012 looked like
Heeeelllooooo BronyState!~ :3
hi AdamTheDuck
AdamTheDuck: Heeeeeeellloooooooo! :)
13why not just tell theoden to round up the army while gandalf leaves, then they get there in three days
Hello AdamTheAwesome
13not at sunrise at the most convenient time
0,14Shizuka, that's not cinematic enough
/me eats some haomemade pizza :$

I'm eating some poptarts. :D

13oh yeah they'll milk that driveshaft reference a few more times :3
I'm craving a burger right now, though.
I wish i had poptarts
Well, we've a bit of a sticky wicket

I've been going through the manga however I could
bet there'll be a friendship is magic manga in the future
or anime
meh, Case Closed/Detective Conan is okay, but too repetitive for my taste.
I like it when it actually has plot progression, but it's become a cash cow.
>become
like pokemon =D
It's ALWAYS been a cash cow.
that's its point.
WHat has?
Detective Conan
Pokemon's also always been a money maker.

I watched the Spoonful of Sugar from Mary Poppins yesterday. I'm quite surprised how the movie has aged.
Specifically, when Mary and the kids snap their fingers and everything magically gets put away.
SaxyPretender: though hey, maybe they just have the guy who directed Paranormal Activity film The Navidson Project and call it a day.
0,14that would work too
i'd watch the shit out of it.

Shizuka: "retired"
Dis Legolas.
0,14yeah, iirc, you guys went to the Conference finals
FistFullOfQuarters See, I say the same thing, but the sad thing is that the only way for this to be true, is that we have to throw all those good things into a capsule, send it into space, and blow up the earth. That is the ONLY way the will cease to exsist.
Barbetos: We need to live on Mars. Curiosity can be our president.
Unless some one.. already sent the crappy stuff into space too.
Just don't bring any cats, Curiosity hates cats.
Well, I've got to head to bed. S'been fun. Danku for stream Shizu

Night, Saxy. Bustah wolf in dream stage 01.
13i dunno that one's 99% melee
Spectrum_Rush, nonononononononononono..... maybe... nonononononono.
So, these fucking ghosts couldn't have helped a bit with Mordor and Sauron????????
13plus some cuts with frodo and the ring
Lonko: it would have gone against Aragorn's honor as king to not let them go
0,14also, Shizuka, sinfest
RAWRity: He could have. After that Mordor business.
Screw Honor
Ew no.
This movie has more climaxes than... that... never mind. I'm not going to say it -_(\
13:3
Lonko: their oath was to defend GOndor in battle. They did so. Their oath was fulfilled and to hold them longer would have been dishonorable.

Dat's a long way down.

How about the titty twister
Gay Porn - One time - Never again
I don't get it
Polydunami: You don't get it? How can you not GET IT man. It's IT.
Just One Time?
Of course I didn't get it either until later on....
The internet doesn't just understand ONE TIME, son.
But that's beside the point, you still need to get it man
...?
No, I was talking to Moopy.
Ninjazz: Lol, yeah just once
Polydunami: Oh ok, my bad bro
As in, I'm not understanding the joke
Is there any humour in this?
Polydunami: Oh, that makes more sene
But have you ever get a titty twister dude?
Moopy: No I have NOT
How does not understanding something make sense?
cram it lumpy
I don't get it :S
Heh i did that to myself once it hurs
Polydunami: It makes sense because apple dash

sorry mixed upwords
Admiral Gimili.
Moopy: It's Ok.
Thanks dude
Moopy: I laughed more at that typo than I did during most of this rifftrax...
Actually, Moopy, I know what you were talking about. Where I live, it's called the purple nurple.

Where I live, we call that sexual harassment.
Uh oh
Mordor its like los vegas eccept without the pyramids
How in the hell do you sexually harass yourself? :S
I do that all the time
Polydunami: I do it every night
Its complicated

Polydunami: It's complicated
I guess it's possible...
No see i do the titty twister at myself i do it most of the time dude
Who opended the oblivion gate?

I guess you could say that gollum's passion for the ring was BURNING
and he died happily ever after... i think
He was just DYING to wear that wrong
He was so close he was HOT
Sorry about that the chat derped on me so whats the next rank after feild marshall?
Frodo can't give him a hand because he already gave a FINGER
"its lunchtime, back to base"
