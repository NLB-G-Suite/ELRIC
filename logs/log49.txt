"In Volume 8, Shirai Kuroko accuses Mikoto of hiding some sort of dieting secret using her ability. Kuroko infers that she (Mikoto) uses electricity to burn away unnecessary body fat in order to keep her body slim no matter how much she eats. Mikoto denies such an ability exists. " <- what th-

!espeon
/me still belongs to Skylands for 2 more minutes
Nv+8374m ufteuxtsvvs
Anyways, my fabric is being shipped
This is gonna be a legit soft espeon plush
yo
nice
:D
06:3!
06Silky smooth I hope
06Or fluffy
06Or both
06Hopefully both
/me dies
!Espeon
/me still belongs to Skylands for 38 more seconds
!espeon
yay :D
Silky smooth
o3o
the Espeon fur?
Very soft
Not extremely fluffy, but perfect for espeons
06That's just as it should be
06Soft but not Flareon
06And silkyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Yep
And it will be life suze
Size
So yes
*good
06:3!
06That's a lot of Espeon
Um, id say so
Yes it is, but enough its never enough
I'm curious, do you have a picture I can see?
I almost got another two yards to fulfill my wish of an espeon sofa
Yeh um
There's so many interesting people in this channel, and I never bother to talk to them
yes?
flareon is a puff
Do me a favor and grab the link to my plush folder in my da gallery
sure
I'm on my phone atn
Atm
yes'm :3
06Flareon, cloudeon.
Cloudeon
Just pictured it
...
that
would be so floory
Luna that's my gallery there
*floofy
yes it would
Thank you very much!
And since my mind is floof enough
o.O I watch you...
It went floof exponentially
Oh you do? Lol
that sounds a lot creepier than it's supposed to
but okay
I watch you.... sleep
Lol
But yes, I don't go on dA much, I've no clue who I watch
I really like the Kyuubey plush
Thanks, that thing scares me though
The eyes are a little better than I wanted
They always see you
Always into your soul
Just like the real Kyuubey!
02Want a wish? :3
Which makes it creepier
I'd love to take up plushie making, but I don't have much talent for sowing
It takes an insane amount of logic and thought
Yeah, I'd imagine
Like right now I'm sketching patterns for this next one
10Hi Max
10Oh, nevermind
you can do it from scratch?
yeah that'swhat I've been doing
None of these are preexisting
I made them all from scratch
...
THAT'S why I watch you
I had no clue that was you Aurora
...lol
I forgot I had my phone name
And that not everyone knows the difference
You've inspired me, I think I might try to make a plushie since I've nothing better to do
Its hard, but so worth it
I don't frequent the channel much, so I don't associate certain names with others
I always get depressed drawing something, and I can't physically hug it
So I make up for it like this
I'd imagine, my room would be filled with plushies if I had that talent
And since I'm highly critical of pushes at stores
I do my best
o_o
Mega Netsplit
Do you have to order the material online or would a local fabric store have what is needed?
It's best to know geography before doing a fail on it
http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kqattk2plw1qzit7go1_500.jpg
I wonder if you horizontally flipped a continent, how many people would still recognize it
02dead, of course
02:D
Depends
What continent, and what direction?
GoD?
As for fabric, I normally just browse in stores
That's true
I've seen a map of the world upside down, and it looks a lot different
This is the first time I've known what I need and bought it specially online
Actually, maybe not, the shapes are pretty recognizable, even upside down or fipped
Need to open up my comp, BRB.

You? lol
04Pretty good, just messin' around with random things after playing tF2
04TF2*
/me bangs head on desk again to stay awake
I swear, I'm unable to get into that game. I turn it on, play one match, get bored, then play a different game.
04ditto
04I'm beginning to wonder whether it is worth 10GB of space lol
I've gotten too used to Sci-Fi shooters. TF2 just isn't fast-paced enough for my tastes.
Yeah, lol, same.
hehe
04I'm too used to Halo where everyone is the same
I play GG2 because it's more fun
in my opinion
I paid for my TF2 even
and I never play it
half because it overheats my system and half because it's boring and there are those no-lifers who spend too much time playing it
I'm just not used to the class switching.
i'm used to classes
because of gg2 mostly
I prefer having everything under my belt and just whipping it out.
It's more convenient.
You know what's convenient?
Microwaves
it's a different style, it's not for everyone
i honestly like both styles
Lol, Patrick.
but seriously, they are pretty convenient
class-based and weapon-based
I prefer old-fashioned shooters, really.
makes cooking fast and bleh xD
at one point i played doom a lot
not too long ago
because i was like "fnck yeah doom"
Doom is my life. Well, part of it, haha.

/me glomps
/me runs
/me isn't exactly in the mood to discuss times right now since she probably has to shop for a new tablet.
A drawing tablet?
7Ah.
7I thought about getting one two weeks ago.
7But I'm mostly a pixel artist.
7And I tried one out on my friend's laptop.
7I wish it was like paper where you directly saw where you were drawing. o3o
04Tablets do help with pixel art Quan
04Especially for getting the base shape.
14Well, after a few days worth of working my butt off, I get a chance to actually draw on my tablet rather than sketching (not that I don't want to, I just haven't had practice for the tablet) I go to plug in my tablet and it decides not to work.
Aww D=
7o.O
14It won't light up, so you can't tell if it's even on or not, but even trying to draw on it won't work.
I hate it when stuff stops working
like my computer
7Well, I'm unfortunately not a tablet expert.
14Now, I'm not sure if some idiot decided to replace my cables, or if it's just that the entire thing isn't working.
7Is it warranted?
14It's been over a year since I got it.
You never used it before?
14Pattyrick, hardly.
14Because I was always moving around and never was able to unpack it.
13Goodnight all :3
02Night Angel~
Goodnight AE =D
14Also, it's really hard to take out the cord too.
14But easy to plug in.
14Which I think is majorily off.
14And I'm going to be even angrier if my "sister" decided to barge into my room and touch my things.
14I'm going to try and search my room if there's another cord that happens to be hidden away somewhere.
14Or else I'm going on eBay and looking for a different cord.
ahhh, ebay

Does Luna have a 3DS?
Nah, I'd never use it
Shame
I would not either
and its not a "shame" either
o-o
the system has not proven its self
Maybe if they came out with more good games
Well, it will eventually :p
its still in the HEYZ LUK WEZ HAVE 3D!
stage
And the whole 3D stage is getting annoying
I don't understand why everything needs to be in 3D
is sort of pointless
except for VR
12then turn off the 3D
And don't whine?
:o
Turn off the 3D. That's funny. xD
Well, I could get the anti-3D glasses off of Think Geek
It's difficult to turn off 3D when I live in it
Wut
They should make Game and Watch remakes for the 3DS. In 3D. That'd be a buy for me.
They did
It'd look something like Paper Mario?
Sorta- http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/14/nintendoware-weekly-netflix-game-and-watch-gallery-3d-pixel-rac/
Close enough? lol
I was talking actual remakes, but I guess we can't have it all.
Netflix on the 3DS? O.o
Can it handle that?
Hurp derp
o_O
Yes
argh fuck
Netflix is basically screwing themselves over now
I knooow
Why?
by unbundling streaming and DVD rentals
:o
Did you see the Blockbuster guy taking advantage of it
you have to pay for each one separately
?
what the fuck
its something like $6.99 a month for each one
actually no ESG is just being a fucker
the total I heard for having both is close to $17 a month
trollface.jpg
Yep
Though, tbh
Wow
WB Sky
I have Netflix and never used the rental service
Peer joined, I disconnect
Coincidence?
/me hides
04Gah
10What happened
!cynder
04I reeeeeeeally hate it when Spore glitches up
I hate the peer script ;p
04Especially when you've only JUST reached the Space stage.
lol
apparently that doesn't work
04There's alwaysd this planet you need to go to for a tutorial - you scan a crashed spaceship - but unfortunately on this save file, the planet glitched up and didn't spawn the spaceship.
looks like you need to drop the DVD rental then Luna
if you only stream
04Now I'm stuck and can't do anything - I'll have to go back and REMAKE MY CREATURE, REMAKE MY CIVILIZATION AND EVERYTHING
then maybe you will be fine
I don't know
Yeah
They're being bold
But I don't think it's going to matter much
Because you can get apps on just your TV now
And just about any gaming system has Netflix, people will still pay to stream from their house
Or just not pay at all, depending on the kind of people they are
04Quan
04get your @$$ on TF2
7Hmm?
7O_o
I actually found my own method for streaming videos to game consoles over networks
04I wanted to see your reaction to that
7Why?
PMP Streamer
04It was lulzy
PMP?
7o3o
04Because no one is playing and it's boring by myself.

7About?
Cool story

02YOU WERE HIS WIFE?
7I'd love to indulge in a bizarre sleep I had two nights ago.
lolwut
well
I have had terrible dreams recently
x.x
basically, my mum and my bro were creating these lolwtf huge snakes by pouring some sort of crap over normal snakes
7O_o
LOLwat
and then sending them out to destroy everything or something
and then
Too much Spykids?
;o
/me np: Reba McEntire - How Was I to Know [03:40m/256kbps/44kHz]
the first one that went out
came over this volcano thing
which "infected" it or something, or so the evil/mean lady there said
and then stuff happened
and then I woke up
ah yes, its kind of neat being able to play your own selection of music over an unmodified clock radio
/me 's dream consisted of his parents hating him and leaving the home
/me goes wat
:>
Hmmm
Skylands, nightmare
Talk about weird dreams
dunno if it means anything
same here
I had a nightmare too :<
I haven't had a nightmare for ages
Lol, that dream sounds awesome, though.
My dream means something
I RARELY have nightmares
I never dream anyway
LOL did youo wake up in the middle of the Night NS XD
I can't remember having a nightmare recently
7I've had a strange dream where I was out in this park, and someone threw this razor-bladed frisbee in the air.
10You seem like a person who doesn't afraid of anything
or did you sleep though it XD
10No lie.
after the nightmare
7The deadly disc circled around until it aimed at my neck.
Though a few years back I kept having bad dreams and nightmares involving monsters and ghosts
so I was like "oh crap what the hell, when did it get this late"
lolwut
I have not had nightmares in years
7I then felt a very REAL sharp pain there in real life.
o-O
7And then I woke up. o3o
o.o
and Skylands
I had a nightmare once where there were a lot of monster cars
.o
that would usually be the case :p
7Naw, that was just one oddity.
Like that one in that car with tentacles movie, but worse oO;
I had a dream a very long time where Megatron chased me through the woods
*time ago

so I can't use IRC and load a page at the same time

it's acting like dialup

I am saying that you should stop telling me stupid things that aren't true
12Heh, well I just know the basics
then don't tell me things that I don't need to know
12Well, you know how many people don't know that?
12Lots
no one that wants to hear it atm, and you were telling it to me and not someone else :p

03more than just some :/
I've talked to one of them
07if you always have something to say out of it when I use it not even knowing if you're gonna react to it

wat
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
is what <@Kyu> if you always have something to say out of it when I use it not even knowing if you're gonna react to it
translated to
07because all you're doing is creating an argument when you talk against something that other people like
drf it's a meme
03k
07basically what I'm saying
basically translated to "what the hell are you saying?"
07is stop reacting to the face just because someone does it
and yeah I get what you're saying, Kyu
07especially when it's not directed at you
well, I don't like the face but I don't react to it :p
07or else they'll use it more
12Actually, I dislike that face very much. o3o
12Danny's like a script

03garbage in, garbage out
03I mean
03hi

07o3o
03why would ou want to block ctcps
that was power abuse? ):
07the ban, even though it wouldn't work
drf, I've had bad experiences it
with it
07and the filter
07o3o
that was a joke though :p
and the filter was an accident
I forgot to +o
er
ctrl + o
12Just like when NS used +m on drf

That was legit
because they were acting like idiots and dramatizing the channel

07eh?

spamfilters, Kyu
/stats f or /spamfilter
the mibbit quit message is done by spamfilter too
lol teh mibbit quit message needs to be fixed XD
:p
.o.
03inb4 !say
also that
03LOL did he do that on another channel?
no on here
:p
!say !FLOOF!
03wait
12o-o
03it doesn't actually show it?
it's spamfiltered
it blocks and kills
03oh
03weird
F is just the stats thing
cpN shows where the spamfilter is applied, and in this case, it's in a channel, channel notice or PM
kill shows what action is taken, for example, a gline, gzline, block, warning, or kill...which is what it is in this case
03so if you were to type Quit: Mibbit whatever default message, it would kill you ? XD
Excess_floof is the reason, and _ is translated to a space
and :stuff is the regex/what is said, minus the :
and well
only if you typed http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client
as your quit message
03where does it mention quit
and since it's a raw kill, not a client kill
03:http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client <- I just see that
q @ drf
the type
03er
03oh
07lol
and Kyu, there's your explanation
of reading /stats F aka /spamfilter
:p

that's mine
not like anyone can read it, but...
/me hides
03o.o
12lol Kyu
03and yes, f u gzline indeed
it's basically against nicks that go like derp1235
lmao
03guest146823?
it's great against botnets :p
well, stupid spambot scripts like clonesxs
which is a mIRC script for spamming channels/networks using proxies
it's useless against sophisticated programs/scripts though, like muhstik, which most people use these days
03real pros don't need scripts to spam
rooooofl
I made a pretty simple mIRC script the other day
brings on any number of clones that you specify, and it connects to a specified server and channel
then you do /startspam and then it continuously spams the channel using those clients, and the great thing about it is that it can do well over 100 lines without being killed for excess flood :D
as you can tell, I was bored
>|
it'd be really great for #PM
/me hides
roooooofl
use muhstik or clonesxs :p
clonesxs only runs on mIRC as it's a mIRC script, and muhstik was originally created for linux, but there's apparently a windows version
there's other stuff out there like cloneflooder but those are the two most popular ones...not sure about clonesxs though
also Kyu, you need to help me with my pokemon battle script ;_;
the calculations are doing my head in
07lol
and do you know how to use mIRC sockets? >:
07no
07o3o

I suck at them
/me derps
the last one would be useful but that's only if I succeed at even getting it started ._.
03LOL Netflix for 3DS
03now if they had 3D movies
03I would consider it
lolwut
I still need to get Altair's !lag script
except I don't think he has it anymore
/me scripts one
07doesn't that just ping someone and return the results?
yep
but in seconds
and my internet is lagging too much for me to VNC into my server and play with mIRC's commands
04o-o
o-o
03\o-o/

...
please don't tell me
I just realised that you can make custom identifiers in mSL

7WHOO.
7I had two crazy dreams last night.
I probably had a dream, but I usually forget them instantly =\
7One had me trying to collect some stuff I had that a teacher threw out. Which involved going to an aquarium with seals and stopping by its local incinerator.
0__o
7The second was vivid and fun; I, with two other people, were trying to find a person's craiglist account. For two different reasons:
7The first, 'realistic' reason, the first part of my dreams, was because another Illinois governor wanted to sell his seat. :U
LOL
7It somehow transitioned into a bizarre mix of TF2 and Pokemon, where I had to send my Emboar out and teach it Heat Crash to investigate why physics somehow got awry.
7In this case, I have no idea why I had to crack on the computer, except to find some essential data.
7Once I found the data, I went onto Steam (yes, in real life), and connected on TF2 and went on the same 'server', or real place in life, as my friends.
wow
that's pretty interesting...
I wish I had dreams that were as interesting
but I woke up just as it was evolving into Lucario D=
7I'm not done!
7When I was connecting (which resembled me travelling through some sort of warphole), I thought about a prankI could do, and mentioned it to my Emboar. My Emboar called on his cellphone(?) that I was coming.
7-l
7Now, my friends were on the staircase of this regal, Victorian hotel.
7Which happened to have this long air vent that was above the staircase and led right to them.
7I, connecting to the server, went as a Spy (:U) and cloaked, went down this chute, and backstabbed one of my friends. It took them a slight second to realize that it was me that was there. :P
7(Of course, respawn existed there, so it's not like my friend died. O_o(
7)*
7NOW that ended.
7Crazy dream, eh?
Wow
Indeed xD
I think I need to read it again to completely understand it xD
7Lol, okay.
7How much do you know about TF2?
04Well that was fun
Nothing
04Being the soldier is more fun than I though
I know what it means, but nothing of the game
7Ah.
06All the classes can be fun, which is what's so awesome xP
04I still can't figure out what key is used to taunt
7G, I think.
7But I use mouse3.
04mouse3 is clicking the mouse wheel isn't it?
06G
7Since the scroll wheel scrolls between weapons.
7Yep.
06default, at least
04Yeah, my mouse3 is buggered for some reason
04Can't even rotate in Spore: GA Adventure Creator anymore, which really makes it difficult
04And thanks Xeli
06I have the buttons on the side of my mouse bound to voice chat and "Thanks!" so :>
06And lol :3
7:/
04I want a new mouse because of both that, and the fact that it keeps running out of battery
04I want a wired mouse
Quan is fron New Jersey?
/me shrugs
hmm
It's so hard to be online with friends when I'm in Italy
the time difference is weird
4Hello.
04I'm in Aus and Xeli is in Europe
Yup
04It's hell for us as well.

04Well
but I'm from Washington
04I probably have an easier time than the both of you
yeah
12 Hello, YoukaiSlayer and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

04I'm GMT+10

7Ahem.
04wb Quan
7Thank you, Lyon.
7So, what'd I miss?
04You're welcome
Hem Hem
04Nothing much, just Pat and I raging about timezones
Us talking about the time differences
Based on your join info, you're in NJ?
04It's depressing
7Tri-state area. o3o
lol
brb
04Hey Quan
04Do you write alot?
7Write? Don't have time to, unfortunately.
04And as a follow-up question, do you have any large/enourmous story ideas that you have just sitting around in the back of your head?
04Ah
7My imagination is pretty sharp, as you can see from my dreams. :P
7Well, sort of.
7The sequel to a year-old fanfic.
12 Hello, YoukaiSlayer and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
7I have it incomplete. D:
04H-uh
7It was supposed to be done by the time BBS came out. XD
04How large do you usually tend to estimate your stories to be?
04...heh
04Missed that deadline
7I'd say 10000 words.
7About.
7I don't write novels.
04Hmm
04Well that's the complete opposite of me
04I really think I think about my stories too often
04My spyro fanfic alone is planned to have at least 4 books, each about 25 chapters long (with the last one being even longer) and several thousand words per chapter.
7Hmm.
04Whereas CoE and my future/sci-fi story...well, let's not even go there.
04I know it's gonna bite me in the @$$ one day though.
04I mean, the science/sci-fi one (I haven't thought up a good name for it yet) I'm looking around around 7 'books'
04Probably even more knowing my habit of expanding upon every single tidbit.
04And given how scientifically accurate I'm trying to make it...
7Try and make that story for NaNoWrMo. :P
04It took me a while to remember what that was since we don't have that over here
04but hey, 7 books in a month? SURE /sarcasm
04Besides, I'm trying to focus on DoI(Spyro fanfic) so I DON'T get overwhelmed.
back
7I'm not sure how well this works for you, but here's an idea:
7Write the story in complete, but half-baked.
7Then go over it and edit it.
04Oh that would kill me
04Whenever I write, I push myself to make sure EVERYTHING is right, all continuities are correct, everything is explained properly (unless the plot calls for it) and that there are tiny little details like someone'se movements or the placement of an objects that hint at something in the future.
7Well, that might work to your advantage.
7You've written an entire story. Now go back and perfect it.
04...maybe
04Depends if I'm busy with DoI or not, since that's my major focus at the moment.
04But hey, sounds like a good idea.
the Coca-Cola here in Italy is awesome
04...I also hate how I've basically MADE the LoS series my own ._.;
better than in the States
04Haha nice cut-in Pat
/me pats
lol, sorry
just had to say it xD
7o.o
7Eh, I had that dream I just spat out. :P
7Amazing how detailed they are, eh?
Yeah
7I could go on for a few more sentences about them.
7Should I? X3
and that you can remember them that vividly
sure, why not? xD
7All right.
I didn't hear the 2nd reason
7I like these vivid dreams, because unlike rather blurry, indistinct ones, they feel real.
I know what you mean
7Your sense of logic and skepticism is rather suppressed in a dream.
04I never have really vivid dreams
7So you sort of enjoy your dream environment to its fullest.
mmmhmm
Same here
and even when I do, I never remember them =\
7So it's like a portal to fantasy. :D
in fact
7And it's spectacular what you may find there.
7Even if it's a mix of TF2 and pokemon. O_o
I had one that I knew was awesome, but I very sparesely remember it
04I remember having this one dream when I was really young, I was Chewbacca running away from droids through a primary school playground.
lol, Chewbacca xD
/me 7hmms.
04Oh, and I also got a story idea from one - About psychics in a steampunk world running away from a corrupt government.
Raaawww!
04Ah, good times.
And the droids
with their weird voices
'After him, NOOOOOWW!'
'Roger roger.'
What's a steampunk?
04It's difficult to explain so I summon 'Wikipedia' into the encounter for 5 turns at the cost of 150 MP
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk
hmm
sorry for interrupting, I sometimes tend to do that without realizing it =|
/me 7lol'd.
04lol That's fine
please continue what you were saying
04It's not like I don't do that
04OH I wasn't saying anything else
/me 7is alternating between this and spriting.
04But hey, psychics in a steampunk world - you gotta admit, that's pretty cool
7Indeed.
7http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1962/suigunoiv.png <-- Old doodle in a planner. :U
7Current WIP.
04H-uh
04Nice sketch
7It's only adequate. o3o
that's a good drawing =D
04If you say so
04I happen to disagree
7Well, it's a sketch, if anything.
7And it's not really significant in any aspect. O_o
04http://i51.tinypic.com/6sszo3.jpg
04That's a sketch
04My first actualy sketch in two months
04and it sucks
04Compared to mine, yours is godlike
7Naw, yours has more detail and a better pose.
7I could argue tidbits in editing.
04Face is too long
04Horns are too thin
04wing isn't in the right position and has too many folds
7Eh, I don't know Spyro's style. :P
04Which hide the back and tailbase
7So it's okay to me.
04It's not spyro's style, it's my style.
yours isn't bad either, Drake
04Admittedly, I stole a bit from CASF and other spyro artists but still...
04Oh, and the left (our left) paw is too large, and the arm is too concealed
gah, gtg
Bye! =D
04Cya Pat

7Lyon?
04Aye?
7Do you think, on dA, you could recommend me for a DD? XD
04...How do I do that?
7PM one of the gallery moderators about a suggestion (depending on the medium), and wait for a response.
7Let me get the list of which mods for which types of art.
04Ok then...
04They need something simpler
04Like something where you just click and it says "Thank you for your vote!"
7Well, we wouldn't want suggestion-spam. :P
04True there
7So, eh, could you? ^^;
04Sure. Is there a particular piece you'd like recommended?
7Do you think of any?
7Personally, I like Tynamo in Chargestone cave...
7Cave&
7Cave*
04Well I thought of that traditional image where the ball & chin was attached to you...
04chain*
7o.O
7?
13ohai LU :3
04I can't find it, that's all
13I'm a ninja, I can't help it :P
13!espeon
04I remember you drew an image of a ball & chain, with the chain seemingly 'coming out' of the paper and attaching to your arm.
13o-o LOL k
04Or was it you?
06and okay I had to browse somewhere I could click your icon to get to your profile without getting a 404 Quan
04I can't remember
06That's odd, silly da
3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
7Erm, nope.
13!espeon
7If you mean the one with two hands, one 3d, one 2d...
04Hmm, nevermind.
04If I may ask Quan, why the sudden urge to get a DD?
7Was looking at DDs for pixel art.
7That person named Light Ho-Oh or something got one for something simpler. O.o
04Link?
06lol DD's
06It seems like they work in some kind of odd way that no one fully understands
06But I'd say if that gets a DD you should get one too Quan, but I know nothing about spriting and I'm just judging on "That looks really good"-factor alone
/me flops
7It's much simpler than what I do. :P
7But maybe I'm trying too hard in some aspects which makes it worse. O_o
7Or maybe it's because I'm relatively unknown.
7How do I check how many people watch me?
04Um
04What?
04Why did that get a DD
7I know.
7Then again, emoticons get DDs.
7For example...
06there's better examples of DD's how do they work, trust me
06In all categories
04Well
04Some emoticon DDs are deserving because of the great detail and effort put into them, especially that hospital one I saw a while back
7No, this one was very simple.
7Mrr, I can't find it. O_o
7Well, I'll describe it.
7An emoticon watches a pixel fly (one dot) hover back and forth.
04...That's all?
7Yep.

I hope so
Onore Decade-oh
I would love Studio B forever if they actually made a Pink Pantheresque episode with Pinkie in season 2.
...and now I have the Pink Panther theme in my head
Haha, the Pink Panther is win.
Who would be the poor pony Pinkie torments, though?
Twilight, who else? :p
We already had Feeling Pinkie Keen...
Exactly, she's the designated Pinkie victim. :p
Almost all the available MLP shirts are aimed at men. Ahahaha, world, prepare to be boarded.
What video is this btw?
I think it was the Ponies Anthology?
Correct.

I gotta edit my TST profile, haven't touched it in months
any To Aru Majutsu No Index fans here? :D

two seasons
Biribiri is awesome!
and Accelerator is :3
1048 episodes then
mhm
if you ask me, its a bit like Soul Eater
/me may check it out sometime
but espers against magicians
you must has!
Its awesome ;D
10Lol espers, just like in Haruhi Suzumiya
yeah
Itsuki, esper boy, as quoted by Kyon
10Itsuki > Kyon
Why this?
Anyway
I broke my glasses today
and I have two job interviews on Monday :(
yeah, saw your status
Such misfortune for you :P
and why this transferring all over the place?
not all over the place
Yeah but
I just can't really get used to it and such, i'm better off in my old school
From Mayflower to Balestier Hill (if I remember correctly) and back to Mayflower
Why the transfer in the first place?
I made it in a rash decision,
because I was like, okay forget it. I had enough of this crap, then ya know. I transfered. Well I regretted it
Ich
Guess next time you will think over your decisions carefully
yeah
and how've you been?
OK
Today was a bit suck though
I realised I can't have coffee without anything else
My body revolts
And stuff happens
and then my job interview was shifted to Monday on the last minute :(
I was already starting to get ready :/
ah, we all have our bad days sometimes.
Yeah

I feel like such a tard for not having them
I loved them

I mean it took me YEARS to beat OoT the first tiem but i was a wee filly
then I got it and pow was AWESOME
MM was even better IMHO but a lot of people think OoT was the better one
I did beat MM befor OoT though
did MM use the ram expansion?
I had a guide for MM to help me get unstuck as I was new to thsoe types of games and about 10-11
I think it did yeah

6To settle it once and for all.
8upload them to imgur, then post the link
6We hold the highest times on ponychan, that I know of... 93 hours and 97.5...
6And after this, I'm done staying up for extended time, and hopefully he will be too.

6Once he shows up I'm going to make him agree to never try anything like this again after this.
lol
10Hi Patrick

we should watch some actual shows or something, otherwise this is gonna be a boring pre-show
6We will in a bit.

6I know DCD said before he was unsure if he'd make it this week... any word from him?
i havent heard from him at all
11Hello?
12not much
06Hm
is mibbit having troubles?
cant connect to irc via web
hi, are there really only three people in the room?
yea I was wondering that too
I connected earlier, but read something about them changing the server - can you access the embedded chat on the bronystate site?
nope, I can't atm
which is why I'm here too
sprinkles said it was the right server
testing again, hang on
Connection failed (Could not connect)
same here
let's hope its temporary
I asked in the ponychan discussion thread, I guess they'll know what to do
hm
ohai
why is it so empty in here? :C
hello :>
seems like we have technical troubles
most likely they changed servers without telling us
hm I see
hm, so apparently mibbit is derping which separates those connecting by way of the embed are in a separate server than those connecting with a client
or something
apparently
hope they get it sorted till the movies begin
eeyup
but I guess by the time the movies start, everyone will just get in here if the embedded chat doesn't work
Ahh, net split.
ah, so it'll be an european chat in here?
a*
hehe looks like it
7 why cant I set colours as standard in my client..
You probably need a script for it if you aren't using mibbit.
I'm using kvirc atm

Server*
does it have web support?
would it be able to handle about 300 people?
Elky: Yeah, that'd be the interesting part. ;)
Sathi: mIRC can connect to any server just fine.
Maybe it doesn't support SSL, I don't know, but I don't use SSL anyway.

It's from the show Mythbusters.

And what an effort that was

"20:41] -Global- webchat is down until someone with access to the server appears. Sorry for the inconvenience."
Then someone came on, and reconnected the servers.

there you have the context

that sounds delicious
Missed something?
6Mibbit was down for a while... :/
10It is
me too ghosties, I really felt uneasy
10I love a bit of chaos
10gives me a good reason to spam the deathstalker button
I haven't had a smoothie from Orange Julius or Jamba Juice for a long time...
haha
/me wonders how it can still be called lemonade when it's raspberry o-o
fuckyeah <3
they're amazing
it's kinda pathetic when what you're most looking forward to is watching movies with people you don't know on the internet
4HIPSTER!
4Good
10yo hipster
8i have returned
Wazzup Hips
13Ew. Hipster.
nah you can't say it like that
13Get out
13j/k
it can't be pathetic if you enjoy it
13Love ya
13<3
I think it's because it's lemonade + raspberry, but the raspberry is a little overwhelming
Hello Hipster
true dat
hi hipster btw
wait
is this Mythbusters?
8yes it is
How much does the average 15 year old male polar bear weigh?
OH YES <3
Hell ya for mythbusters
Still online?
O.o
!pokemon
Floof
Hey
Floofies :)
i guess the one good thing I've taken from this experience is a slightly better grasp on connecting to IRC through other clients..
Just enough to break the ice
As easy as that should be, I've never had to before :P
8this show proves emphatically that edutainment is possible
True dat
I wouldn't talk of mythbusters as education
8why not?
6MYTHBUFFERS
but it's sure entertaining
4He said edutainment : D
8lol sprinkles
10wb sathi
4Hello Sathi
06Oh my
7thank you :)
06Hot
06Pun intended
06Or maybe not
06huehue
How do i see the video and the chat OH HAI SATHI <3
glad you made it sathi ;)
Maybe :P
Espeons are hot
7internet started to derp
In the summer :)
6We're watching Mythbuffers. : D
10[14:55] <Pattyrick> How much does the average 15 year old male polar bear weigh? <- 350-680 kg?
8fireheart3, what do you mean?
Nope
Is Sathi new? Anyway, hi!
Just enough to break the ice :B
My chat is at the bottom so i can't see the video and mythbuffers
4No, Sathi's been here
7yep i'm new to the team
10Oh, it was a joke
/me is trying to say he was trying to break the ice
4For every BMN
exactly
7but been here before
brb
/me hopes DCD shows up
Well I'm surprised this is the first net split we've encountered.
Woo
Net split
...CURSE YOU DECADE
not again...
oh boy
:|
What Happen?
Netsplit
A net split.
10Fun.
Brb
Switching back to pc
6I think my old college just screwed me over...
How? O.o
WB Rora
6they didn't send my transcripts
11.•10«11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- WE FULLFILL EACHOTHER
06Okay this is somewhat annoying x3
Oh boy
Another net split Ghosties.
6now my new college is requesting them from me, I have less than a week to get ahold of them, and this means i need to fly to LA next week
I knew why I didn't quit the client...
07fly?
07you should roadtrip
6yes
07:'D
6it wont be enough time
This is going to be an interesting movie night
6I literally do not have time for anything here
07boo D:
One of the best movies ever, coupled with one of the worst
Fucking fuck
6they've already placed the hold on my account, I was supposed to register for classes next week
and I haven't seen either one
And now I learned what a netsplit is...
Lawl.
Net split for great justice.
13Isn't there a way you can tell them you need a bit more time or something?
Hey Ghosties, head over to mod chat?
6not really
Okay
So
Question
6universities have to deal with thousands and thousands of people
When I input my password, did other people see it?
Nope.
Okay, thank god
So, I was thinking that all the mods could set up servers on the IRC network I've set up.
SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING
Hello
Boom
Something
SOMETHING
So then we could share the work load.
Something
It might be able to handle 300 people.
you forgot the caps
You'd have to talk to the other guys
Nah.
Kind of hard when they aren't here.
My brain filters those things out.
I'll get on skype I suppose.
Well, this should be interesting
Who would give those two permission to RC a big military vehicle?
I don't think I want to know
Michael Bay maybe?
12Hi Roara ^v^
Heya Arti?
12Mmm?
Hmmm
12hi blue text person
12Oh
06x3
michael bay isn't that craz
13Artiguest
:)
y*
Why is it that Luna looks so adorable in socks?
12arti
I'm still waiting for thick wool socks
13!espeon
Kneesocks?
those silk thingies aren't too interesting
12Too many lame people complained :/
Well, Sathi made it
something like that espy
12People can't take a joke, it's really annoying
looks like mibbit is having issues again
Because Luna looks innocent. Adding cute, frilly socks just adds to it.
12lol
what did I do?
:)
12What's the thing to check whether or not websites are down again?>
And the socks are pink!
Indeed
6o.O
!check www.lugia.us
No
pink? where?
12thanks
12these people can take a joke though
I've only seen blue ones iirc
Not to mention how she's presented
12ovO
Wait, I think all bots are down
6ocean is down
Ouch :|
12Does Google work for anyone here?!
6yes
Yes? XD
6The site? Yes.
06yep
12Ovo
12So many sites are down for me >v<
12I'm not sure whether there
12Is a major problem or it's just my router
You did nothing wrong
pfew I was worried for a moment
did this happen with mibbit before?
just to make sure, are you still there?
I don't think I've seen Luna in blue socks.
12ovO?
07o3o
6I'd come up with some elaborate metaphor for what I'm going to say next, but I can't think of any.
No, I'm just confused about where the rest of the mods are
It is sometimes better to keep things simple
I think I am...
well people cant connect atm, as the webclient cannot connect
i'm here via my own irc client
good to hear
With our current situation, mods are missing, the video is constantly buffering, and we have no means to effectively moderate people in the chat
if Luna has kneesocks, who is Scanty?
That I'm aware of
I guess you can just simply use the same commands as always
Finally figured out this mIRC thing.
Well, why don't we just move the mibbit IRC to another server?
*shrugs*
I know one.
I'm talking to Sprinkles and RainBroDash via Skype
I could just register channels and stuff for temporary use?
6A majority of the people polled state 'yes' for him to be de-modded.
scanty & kneesocks?
03yay sleeping in until 3PM?
07lol
10loltiming
Epic timing
07I slept in until noon, at least
05Derp
6:>
07o3o
Celestia, of course
6same as Kyu, I didn't expect to sleep that late though
6Ahem; Articuno?
is the sound looping for you?
yes
Yes.
Yup
Yes
yes
Meat the sandwich?
06At least having XD in there in front of GoD makes it more difficult to take it out of context or read it as CoD :B
What...
The hell?
07maybe she reset her router o3o
They must be TF2 fans.
Meet the Sanvich?
sandvich
6Maybe.
OMNOMNOM
03that or God :P
and then it was offline
lol the stream derped
Oh you DRF :p
6for some reason
everything is fucked up today
It's Brony Appreciation day! Why is everything derping?
06Well that's what I meant by taking it out of contest drf :P
06But yes
6CamelCase.
Out of all possible days...
Derpy's a pony too.
HumpBack Whale?
It's back, thats good.
6There comes Ocean.
Cool story
07woo
03oh
03wait what
03the VPS is still offlikne
03-k
03which makes no sense LOL
Derped again!
6hmm, flights to LA will be about 175 for two people?
.
for how long though?
lol
whoa
It's a super derp.
wut
According to FlutterPeanut, mibbit is running
07sounds a bit high o.o
it is...
for now
6oh ouch
6 175 for ONE person
6one way
07depends on the day I guess, but sometimes you can get them for....
07OW
6when did SJ/LA trips get that ridiculous
hmm
07WTF
03can't you just drive?
6they've NEVER been that high
6god i think maybe we will drive
07take amtrak
07:'D
6I really don't want to, but ugh
07who's going with you?
6my dad
Ok.
03what's happening in LA?
I relocated the server, no net splits.
6the reason we probably wont drive is because he'd be driving
I'm not registered supposedly
Yeah, different server Ghosties.
6drf, my old college screwed me over with my new one
6and didn't send my transcripts
14What?
03LOL what
14Wow
14Just wow
.
14That really really must suck
.
Wellllllll
6the only way to get them delivered in time (and to be sure they actually GET THERE), I'm going to deliver it in person
?
6um yeah
seems like the webchat is still separate
03ah
07can't you send a fax or an email or something?
07like
hm?
07while you're on the phone with them lol
14My school sent my transcripts, but decided to give me all Fs because I was only there for about two weeks
so it seems
14It took a lot of butt hauling to get those grades up
6no
Derp!
14Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to fax the transcripts or email them?
6the transcripts MUST be paper, in person, etc
6that's how transfering works
03policies are dumb
6they are
14well, when's the deadling?
14*deadline?
6july 8th
6:|
14to get it there for school?
6as of now, a hold is on my account
6I can't register for classes
14holy friggin crap
6and registering for classes is next friday
14Well
6I can get the flight easily
6it's the fact that it takes time to process the request form..
14I'll tell you what. Get a car with good gas mileage, gas money, and money to rent a hotel or whatever
6and my old college closes its office fridays at noon
6if i hadn't woken up as late as I did
03well, I think why they require it to be in person is so that you can't forge it
6may, we have a prius, and we don't need a hotel
03as in, I've forged rebate forms before by opening the pdf file in something and editing it XD
03and if you were to fax it
03theoretically you could scan it and change Bs to As, etc
14well, whatever floats your boat
6but my dad doesn't want to do the 6 hour drive twice in a month
14I'd sleep in the car actually
07when are you going?
6wednesday probably
14Well, why can't you drive?
6um
6company car
6so I'm not allowed to drive it
this is derpiest day thus far I've seen.
6otherwise I would
07you could try priceline lol
So many derps.
6true
03but make sure you get to talk to Shatner himself :D
/me runs
14and what happened to your car?
03o.o @ this email
03Next Spring, join a new kind of hero and embark on a journey the whole family
03will enjoy in Disneys JOHN CARTER. Watch the newly released trailer now
03and discover the hero, the world and the action-filled fun that awaits when
14plus, I really didn't think it took that long to deliver some papers to your school from Hollister
hello bronies
6my car wont make this trip many times
03never heard ot ath
03*that
6may
6ONE WEEK
Hey.
6ONE
14WELL I DIN'T KNOW IT TOOK A LONG TIME
6the soonest I can even talk to my old college is monday
14I would have just said get the bast delivery service possible
6but still
6I don't trust my college
14*best
6I am taking those papers
6in my hands
Hi
14then send it yourself?
6to fullerton
Hey.
6if I have to murder someone on the way I will, those papers are getting to fullerton
14okay well, I know I can get a good size package to the otherside of the country overnight, but that's airmail
14and it's expensive
6I'm not doing post
03it's not that expensive
6I don't trust it right now
03it's like 20 bucks
14well
14yeah
03to do USPS express mail
03that's cheaper than gas
finally
6I'm not doing post because i don't trust it right now
07well
03LOL
07you did say in person too
07o3o
oh, nice
did it send and email to me?
14Aurora, and how are you going to get down to Fullerton if no one is going to take you?
07so why would you lol
6I know, that's why i'm just repeating myself
/me sighs @ Kyu
6...
14A bus is not a very good way
wb
Hi all
*Taken op from me*
D:
6I'm fairly certain I mentioned my dad was going with me...
let's hope it won't derp that hard again
Hello
07....
07-_-
03LOL people not reading
14he said he didn't want to drive though
Services are probably just down peanut.
What time is it in your area?
1:33
pm
let's
03I thought you had your own car?
6ok...story in short: my dad and I are going to LA to deliver my transcripts in person, we have one week to do so
/me OTL
good evening everyone
6...
6I also said why we're not taking my car
Wait
I got recognized.
6 12:30	Aurora	my car wont make this trip many times
14drf, you should read
let's?
13So.
jeez....1:33 it's already 9:33 pm here
6ok well
let's hope that
6I'm just gonna stop talking about this
here too
oh, yes.
Everyone here, refresh the page.
03<Aurora> ok...story in short: my dad and I are going to LA to deliver my transcripts in person, we have one week to do so <- Sounds like a plot for a movie
same here
/me hides
Its only 3:34 PM here
6I don't even know why this turned into the topic of conversation in here
aye
ns register
14<Aurora> but my dad doesn't want to do the 6 hour drive twice in a month <-- but he is anyway, right?
reloading
ok i will figure this out.
14he just doesn't want to
the / is important.
Because we care about your education? o.o
XD
hmm, is there a way to detach the chat window? it won't fit on my screen together with the video
6I was just talking about FLYING, because he doesnt want to do the drive twice
Oh come on.
why refresh though?
6so no, he isn't going to
6*drive
14it's cheaper to drive, rather than fly
14my opinions
Huzzah
6doesnt
6want
6to drive
06train
Just type /ns register <your password> <Your email>, then the network sends you an email with the confirmation code (Because it likes to make things needlessly difficult), you enter that code, and you're registered
You could open a second window with the stream only with the sound muted or something
06what about the train
6I'm done talking
I love Mythbusters
14Yeah, true
6since I didn't mean for my personal life to be this big of a deal lol
/me 6awaits Guest7647.
14the train is cheaper also
Yep figured it out. I just used help XD
Oh
Who would not love MB?
Wlel, at least I got some typing experience
teehee
Anyone here who is not using the mibbit on the theatre page?
13ALright well.
Well, if you saw the butchered german version...
Anyone here who is not using the mibbit on the theatre page?
Me
Me
Go to irc.epic-chat.net
Same channel name.
03<Aurora> since I didn't mean for my personal life to be this big of a deal lol <- you would fail as a celebrity then :P
huh. It's no longer on irchighway?
now I'm intrigued
Aurora is kinda celebrity to us, but hehe
We're moving for the moment because this place is being unreliable.
So thats why the chats were seperate.
+a
Oh.
No it's not.
13Ah. Hm.
14lol drf
That's because of the net split.
smart.
I just changed the location of the server on the theatre page.
07the difference being celebrities don't need to talk to their fans about their personal lives lol
So anyone on the mibbit there, refresh and go on again.
is ocean having trouble or something
6Yep.
k
ok, found a workaround - in full screen mode it will fit next to each other. good enough for when things go real :)
14this is also true
we have to register the nicknames again?
6oh yeah, kyu, delta airlines (looking at priceline) for the same exact thing: 318
Okey dokey loki
brb registering mod names
and tacowiz
07for both, round trip right
6yeah
07name your own price |D
07or
DX this is not liking me.
07southwest airlines
6remember the first price I gave you?
6that was southwest
6apparently southwest isn't the great cheap flights anymore
anyone besides fireheart in here?
Neigh.
13Too late, Already Registered.

Ho register.

Hi

8fireheart, you dont need to worry about it
14whoa
14that's awesome
8it wont really affect you
14Aurora, you'll be flying into the LAX right?
Ok i'll just give up.
13Pretty much what Hipster's saying.
13XD
hm
fireheart: if you want, type /ns help
/me is mildly confused now, but meh
now back to physics
the two trucks crashing isn't equivalent to a single truck crashing against a wall at 100 mph
6yes
03home of all the rappers?
because now there are two trucks absorbing the energy of the impact
03I swear I hear LAX mentioned in lots of rap songs XD
[/nerd]
6why would an airport be in a ton of rap songs?
They did an episode on that
14when will you be flying?
07eep
/me 6facepalms
12:)
;0;
!umbreon
14wednesday, right?
6 12:29	Aurora	wednesday probably
12nah
12you don't get to own this char
03<Aurora> why would an airport be in a ton of rap songs? <- I don't know, it just is
12:P
I remember that episode...
lol
Nice :P
14drf, what songs is the lax mentioned in? I haven't heard any lol
12note the upload date drf
12this isn't a name i came up within like the last 5 seconds XD
SCIENCE
Most awesome Myth Busters fuckup ever. XD
Two hours till the movie?
or wait
three I think
three if I'm right
2 hours until preshow
They usually start just when I go to bed.
14which airport are you leaving from, roara?
preshow is now
The timer shows 2:14 for me
but yeah, two hours until ponies
2:11*
There's another showing tomorrow that starts about an hour ago for you Eurobronies, Rezo-chan.
When you usually go bed?
Pony pilots at 6, then main attractions at 7
yeah, we're watching the pilot episodes before the movies today

Yah, but I'm used to fridays ^^
Happy Brony Appreciation Day

03LOL lag
What movie is it, then? (Sorry, too lazy to check, since I'm lazy today)
07LOL T.I.
The Godfather and Battlefield Earth
I just realized Brony Appreciation Day is abbreviated to BAD
Lol
4IT WORKS
Cupcake wine is not a good way to celebrate Brony Appreciation Day, like drinking pure ethanol. No wonder it's $9 a bottle.
YES
And huh, it's been a while since I saw the Godfather
cupcake wine?
wtf am I reading?
03ew, they put the dirty version of the song over the real one :/
03but yeah
03the intro mentions it
This is one of my favorite MB moments.
03and I swear I've heard it other places too, can't remember where offhand
The annihilation of the car
It's a brand of cheap wine called Cupcake Vineyards, it tastes as horrid as you'd expect from $9 wine. XD
I've never seen the godfather.
tbh I'm used to drinking 4$ wine
$9 Wine? that sound apealling in exactly 0 ways.
if we're talking about 0.75l here
I don't drink any alcoholic drinks myself, so ah well
Me neither.
/me does.
Which reminds me, I have a bottle of champagne.
Just gimme some soda, juice or something
I don't.
Does anypony else see the irony in watching a movie with a decapitated horse head on Brony Appreciation Day? XD
lol
Our airport is kinda low-tech and basic with everythin </random>L
lol
It's BAD
Wait which one is that?
*everything
G is great today
You'll see.
And huh
03LOL
Derp okay
It'll be 1AM over here when the stuff starts
but we only used old metal detectors and bag scans :D
So horray security
couldn't you just do the math?
I wonder if I'll be able to pull through, since I'm already feeling lazy and tired
?

03the answer to life, the universe, and everything
Humidity, rain and everything
in that case, you might be stuck with not being able to stay awake
True dat
but you could also drink ice cold water
Ummmm doesn't the B move always come second. That's why it's called a B move
03LOL
it might work...
03Best thing I've heard all day
Better play something to stimulate my brains not to fall asleep
fire: the schedule is randomized
Hmm?
Dee_Twenty looks at the 24 ounce energy drink in his hand.
B movie came first the past two or three weeks
The B movie is the bad one, the A movie is the good one.
Ohai Maybur
Yep double feature.
Sorry i just thought it was funny.
0,75 liter canister of caffeninated drink on hand.
7no worries
A and B movies are not sorted by how good/bad a movie is but by their budget
So wait, Battlefield Earth?
06Mays
yep
6You are playing -, Espy?
Bettlefield earth is hilarious.
14FFFFFFFFF
Never seen it
sup bronies
14this better not be ocean
in a B movie sort of way.
03I think it is
03just use island for now
SATHI! <3
14I'm changing
hiya ds
Hey everyone.
Because it's going to be about 6am here when Battlefield Earth ends here...
Yo
7hehe hi fireheart

Oh HAI DSNESMITH
Waasup Bronies
hi all
Hellew
hope you all brought motion sickness meds for the camera tilting
I can't wait to see godfather for the first time.
Well, okay
best part
Can't wait to see Battlefield Earth. heard it was hilarious.
14eh
and the car went poof
The only time I had motion sickness outside of car and boat trips was playing Perfect Dark as a kid
fire: dunno if bmn is the best way to watch a great movie when you haven'T seen it before
/me hasn't seen any of the films tonight. Isn't sure whetehr that's good or bad
14someone kill May
BE is amazing
So let's see about the camera tilting
Seriously that rocket sled is effin awesome
6'Jesp is now playing -'.
I'll have my head tilted throughout Battlefield Earth
the dialogue is impossibly bad
/me kills May
but I haven't seen it either and don't care
Better/
the tongue scene
8HOW HAVE PEOPLE NOT SEEN THE GODFATHER?!
KABOOM
I've never seen it D:
ZOOM
6Lol.
I havnt seen it lol
I'm young so i haven't seen it yet.
4I saw it in high school, Hipster
*Wants a rocket sled*
Well, Hipster, I've seen it, but I barely remember it anymore
10mad, hipster?
By not being overly interested in the gangster film genre
Me neither.
I also have not seen it
14>>
?
I JUST NEVER GOT AROUND
If you want to prepare your anus for Battlefield Earth you might want to check out the Nostalgia Critic's review.
Well, she's already dead
:<
spiiiiderssss
Man-animal!
/me wasn't overly impressed by whatsitsname... the one playing in Miami and covering cubans, either
14I guess I can ghostkill
Oh wait, NC did a review on it?
14it won't let me
try to ghost?
yeah
:<
Bawww
it's a good one too
yup
Huh, can't remember it, then
Already seen NC's review of BE.
Spoony stole the show on that one
/me 4doesn't watch Nostalgia Critic
wow, that car just dissolved
Nostalgia Critic did the review with Spoony as cameo
ive actually never seen BE, just the NC review of it
Ghosties has no taste. :p
14fffffff I hate this
8i dont like nostalgia critic
I can remember the spoony (and Linkara) cameos, but I can't remember the movie itself
8he tries too hard
NC's getting into the fan circuit a bit much now
whos actually seen the full BE movie?
but he's still funny
I have.
I've seen... most of it
couldn't finish
I watch NC whenever I'm bored
I thing NC has become stale as well... But Cinemasnob is super awesome
MrPoniator: me too
Guess I could check out this week's review while waiting or so
milk money review was awesome
I think they over did it. They need it to go slower.
07weeeeird
so, no idea what he'S like
Not Swordfish?
he has good movies
like PF
Pulp fiction is a great movie.
Welp, I guess I'll go watch that review now, then
and Face/Off
SCIENCE!!!
Gonna grab myself some soda while on it
and then he's got Hairspray
and BE
4Ah, good
14Yeah
14sure is
4You got in fine, Dee_Twenty?
kinda like Nic Cage
why is that, does he just take every role he gets offered?
dunno
does the movie night/day start in 2 hours?
I think Cage takes only the best and worst movies he's offered
his best are okay
the Rock
Nick Cage is awesome. I guess the BMN acknowledges that?
12i can't think
8yes, mare
first National TReasure
121600x1200
Indeed, had to cycle through all the commands I could think of though, connect, reconnect, enter, etc. :p
and then he has the Wicker Man
4Yes, WhatPayne
12what's the blasted ratio x-x
and Ghost rider
cool
034:3
12ok thanks

4July 4th special
Oh. Must've missed it.
Alas :(
Somepony needs to dub over the scene from Call of the Cutie with the burned cupcakes with that dialogue.
have you seent he one with Twilight, spike, and the book?
someone dubbed the dialogue over
have we already seen the room?
Ho'd get burned?
Yes.
Yep.
I'm still wondering if I should choose a western movie again if I get chosen for a movie
6I like the decimal when you divide 1 by 243 or 81.
hah
Someone did with the scene where Twilight finds the book Spike burned in Owls Well that Ends Well
Pick one of the Bud Spencer/ Terence Hill westerns, hee.
and they shopped Cage's face onto her
03@calc 1/243
= 0.004115
Oh yes they did.
i wanna see snakes on a train
03o.o
Elky, we watched Fist Full of Dollars, Westerns are appreciated.
03@calc 1/81
Not interesting at all
= 0.012346
It's your pick Elky, I would hope for a more interesting Western this time though.
6It has to be longer.
oh, what's the one western
6It has to be much longer.
apon, I picked a fistful of dollars
03that's what she said.

You did? Awesome!
03they missed the 8
Djiango would probably a bit too off the scale for folks.
6Indeed.
4Yeah, Elky picked a good film
DSNesmith just described pretty much every Western ever made.
I can't keep up with chat so i'll just watch the show.
lol I realized that
man, though, last week
Deathstalker
that was special
030.00411522633744855967078189300412
03that one I don't get at all
Deathstalker was the best thing ever to happen to BAD
6The pattern.
best b movie ever
err.
BMN
oh
lol
We need a Reb Brown movie.
YES! Reb Brown would be awesome!
wtf are they doing on mythbusters?
yay
I'd suggest Manos, but without the MST3K guys that'd be unbearable
Dropping cars
how about a Terry Gilliam film?
@calc 1/1
= 1
Thing is broken
but why?
Because they can.
/me has seen twelve monkeys at least twelve times.
they're dropping a car onto a truck?
The Python Gilliam? We did Holy Grail.
Man.
I miss all the best BMNs
:(
03how is that broken LOL
Too many 1s
:p
It always displays 1 ;.;
We did Evil Dead 2 that week too, it was epic. X3
Like even with 5/
Ooh, preshow has started?
What about something like Baron Munchausen or The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus?
5
>Mythbusters
1
Everywhere
I approve
so
hard
/me derp
lol
is that the really weird heath ledger movie?
The 1942 Munchhausen?
WOuld be neat
4I know
no, the imaginarium
ED2 and Holy Grail was my first BMN.
4How about a Uwe Boll film?
ugh
look at all that coke
ugh
or my favorite, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
03...
they're supposed to be BAD, not unwatchable
don't even suggest that
035/5 IS 1 though
I know
KILL IT WITH FIRE! Sorry, knee jerk reaction to... that name.
4Suggest what?
Why can't it be something other than 1
Spider's Web was at least fun
1 is getting boring
:p
uwe boll
KILL IT WITH FIRE!
7no it was not
/me would rather watch Uwe Boll than John Ford, but admittedly, that's to do with how much he detests John Wayne.
de 'greatest fucking genius in de whole fucking beezness'
yay more boom.
no
no spiders web
03then do sometihng else
03@calc 1+1
03:P
= 2
wow, you could see the air compressing
Amazing
Spiders Web WAS fun, if you're a masochist.
Spiders Web was someone torlling this channel :(
DRF is my hero
Hipster, tell me you still have it.
/me goes back to GC
taco isn't a troll
I'm a masochist and that was NOT fun.
03LOL
8still have what?
You know
8the pig?
Yes.
8i do
the deal with it pig lol
I keep hearing about this TacoWiz guy. What exactly did he/she do on here?
That's all pig
BUSTED
Also: Someone needs to make a linux cluster out of Wiis
awww
Who's Tacowiz?
He chose Spider's Web.
6We don't talk about TacoWiz
On a brighter note, I increased my bacon consumption after Spiders Web.
He sugessted the pig movie
Ohohohoho.
8he made us watch the worst movie ever
lo
The biggest troll.
6Spider's Web doesn't exist.
lol, he trolled us
he chose Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale for B movie
they should try this Mythbusting with trains
which is, like the worst movie ever
lol
Mockbusters
wats spiders web about?
03It's probably been done
we should watch Transmorphers
about a pig
Never seen it. Maybe I should be glad I wasn't here.
4Hmm...an earlier post made in here lets me know what I'm picking
03I know the US government has a linux cluster of PS3s :P
It makes Uwe Boll look like Oscar-winning genius
7spiders, pigs and snakes
4If I get A movie
8http://i.imgur.com/neWcB.gif
oooooor, for bad-movie awfulness
Video Brinquedo
I think we should watch army of darkness.
It's an even MORE painfully boring version of Charlotte's Web.
The only good thing about the PS3 is the hardware
Ratatoing
Well
whats the B- movie tonight?
Old hardware
DSNesmith: transmorphers or snakes on a train
03it *was* the good thing
I didn't have to see the pig film.
what ghosties?
4Battlefield Earth, HaxBrony
Yaya.
or Giant Shark vs. Mega Octopus
03until Sony started restricting people from actually using said hardware
Scientology in Space.
03>_>
lol john trevolta
Yeah z.z
B movie is battlefiled eart
/me 8slaps dari
*earth
Heheheh.
you missed out prince
/me has his A and B movies picked
03which is precisely why I only use my PS3 to play movies.
I've been intrigued by Transmorphers ever since Nostalgia Critic mentioned it
4Not telling, Elky :P
03as I will admit it's one of the best Blu-Ray players ever.
Does Transmorphers count as a B movie when it's actually BETTER than the movies they're ripping off?
Since I never heard about it before that point
it's much less painful watching it with others
03that and upscaling DVDs.
It is?
apparently Transmorphers actually rips off the Terminator more than the TFs
From what I've heard I avoided years of sleepless nights Elky. :P
hm...
oh, there was this one movie
Komodo vs. Giant Kobra
that one was amazing
well, all of us have a goal in life now: hunt down the guys who made it
still playing the myth buster stuff i see
wanna see this crash
I have to say ONE good thi9ng about Spider's Web.
lol holy shit
It didn't depict the spiders as the bad guys.
I refuse to use HDMI for any HD product
I hope we get drunk cooking
/me likes spiders
Just because I like Component so much
God freakin' damnit
also, the pig's rap was pretty fun
oh, have we seen Shark Attack 3: Megalodon
hahaha
can we watch gordy
I'm laughing at the stupidity of Milk Money, now that I'm watching the NC review
No, but we NEED to
Silly Rezo....
"Say, I'm really wired...."
I love Grant
6ARTI.
03well
Yes. Kicking ME. Not the guy who suggested it -_-
6Aurora?
"what'dyou say I take you home and... eat your pussy?"
I hate pig movies, they make me hungry.
the milk money review is awesome
03I used to use component, until I got my surround sound receiver.
4Oh, trust me, Tacowiz has our ire
TACOWIZ!
4He's Public Enemy #1
BABE pig in the city is best pig movie
6?
what was that pig movie NC reviewed
about the pig that takes over a company
hes just bein a gilda.
implying pig movies can be good
gordy
Pig movies make me want to eat more bacon.
Remind me to give TacoWiz a floppy-shloppy brohoof
^
6If Arti's there.
Gordy
I wasn't here for the pig movie... I guess I was the lucky one?
the Rap
6Just to forewarn.
I just like how you can use a component cable into a AV or vice-versa
That's like being the best Uwe Boll movie, the bar's not set very high.
For maximum trolling
lol, my computer is FAIL

Composite is RGB
6Why? D:

03yeah
where is the original song from again?
My life is complete.
6Yeah, Poniator, we switched servers.
There we go
03point being you can't use component cables as RCA or vice versa
Newsitem: This just in. Fluttershy is cute.
Odd it wouldn't connect me
Oh well
Hey Nick
random video trivia: fluttershy is boring
I am but a head

we always knew you could sing, Scootaloo
And then rip it away from me
12I'm doing good, thanks ^^
Is it me, or do any of you guys hate it when the playback buttons and all "hide" after the cursor leaves the video?
My Youtube is just as before (but then again I live in EU)...
I prefer them to be there at all times
http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/07/angry_birds_could_be_flocking_to_wii_u_and_3ds < Fun

Yup
;)
ugh

02-Windows 7

02+ Windows XP
03wtf?
Smelled glue for a second there
12Ns, I think the OS on wii U would be better
XP sucks
:P
hey, blueblood is awesome
03Windows 7 is totally better.
06XP is nicer
prince jerkface
03XP doesn't suck, it's just outdated
067 is better
he got cake on Rarity
watching some of the pitchfork stream
UNFORGIVABLE
Lols
INB4 BlueBlood arguement goes on forever
Yeah
he messed up pretty pony
just saw one of my friends in the crowd o.O
But this laptop hates XP
that's like disliking gilda because she made fluttershy cry
FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEVEEEEEEEEEER
HENSHIN!
Ohwell
so stupid
ah, this is not Rarity's finest moment
pony lipstick
I dislike gilda because she's a meany face.
>Implying there are people who don't dislike Gilda for making Fluttershy cry
/me 6is done shading Suiguno. :O
It's just not-so-fine moment
02orr
6ONTO THE OUTLINE.
02- Windows 7
02+ Linux
gilda is best griffon
12-Ns
ofc, rarity is ALWAYs fine
06:/
Pitchfork stream?
Ew
And okay
fine = fabulous
But gilda is only griffon.
Bird bitch made Fluttershy cry, bird bitch must burn in the everlasting hell fire of creation.
Linux on wiiu would be boring
No more gaming
spike is best dragon
Finished watching the Milk Money review

Or at least without glitches
Dragon is best Pony

Wiintosh

Not going to happen
damn my 90wpm
Welp, let's laugh at it together, now
YAY MILK MONEY
never seen this. -.-
?
I love how this review takes a dark turn on the THIRD LINE
LOL
dat add!
ಠ_ಠ
AdBlock+ is best pony.
it'd run iOS 5
wow
lol ^^
charming
Nah
It'd run Android
they should have read the book
uh oh.
Then it'll be complete :D
12Actually, the OS that comes with the wii is already a lot like a mac
I can't even wonder what the makers of this movie were on
...
wtf
Just because it is silver?
0.o
What movie is he reviewing?
dafuqs this
Milk Money
Milk Money.
Milk Money.
lol these kids are clueless
looks like a boob?
It's this week's review
grade a dialogue there
It's the movie where a kid brings a hooker to school for show and tell.
ED HARRIS!?
sex ed... in elementary school?
Shouldn't we watch this instead of Battlefield Earth? \(:D)/
lol.
Milk Money is so creepy!
aw lag
This does creep me out.
no
because of its large icons
imagine what the Wii U tablet would be like with iOS on it...
this movie is veering straight into wtfery
WHAT
03it would suck
03:P
dayum
Most schools in the UK start sex ed in last year of elementry school. Dunno about the US
Porn, indeed so
random ass shot
Well
See
And hi everypony. Happy Brony Day
There are many issues
Hey brony
As...the tablet is just a screen
okay what these kids are like 12
sup tuba
So it cant run iOS
iOS
Happy BAD
wasup
yes it can
The Wii U *might*
lol full house
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
...oh sweet Luna
Best abbreviation ever
Always hated Full House.
all the tiiiime
Equestria
Whee
but the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch all are just screens with a few buttons
they dont' wear clothes
Terrible 80s and 90s comedy references :(
Deathly hollows are on sunday
Yay me
03try ONE button
Well, the first time I happened to see porn was when I was 12. I was in a hotel room, and then I turn on the TV. Suddenly, porn at 3PM or so
LOL
wow, did they ACTUALLY break a piggy bank on camera?
kill the pig.
make tacowiz watch
Volume buttons don't count
flk;ajdfk;sdj
Sadly :p
Who highlighted me
hot
home button, lock button, volume buttons
12It only needs one button though :p
this is the charming, heartwarming coming of age story
and, on iPad and iPhone, silence/lock rotation button
No gurl ever paid to wear my jacket
The makers went forward in time and saw Spider's Web.
of three boys and their quest to buy a hooker
03lock SWITCH
03not button
yup
I always killed my piggy banks, because I lost the keys
6MILK IT
whan i was that age there was no internet full of pr0n and we wasn't nearly as clueless as those kids :P
?
adblocker you need it.
true
still, the others are buttons
Do they do anything with the menus?
6DAT MASSIVE CHATLAG
03*buttons
not really
commendably dumb
/me did see his first porn flicks at twelve or thirteen. Did it in a much less awkward fashion than THIS, though
I like that turn of phrase
"Are you prostitute?" the best pick up line ever
LOL
03yes really.
the volume buttons control, well, volume
YOU GUYS NEED SOME HELP?
HEY MR. HAXBRONY
or, Android
my mistake
ARE YOU A PROSTITUTE?
that guy looks legit
THIS GUY LOOKS LEGIT!!
06i'm off to bed
Hello keyboards
06Gnite all
Night LU <
next movie
:<
only on weekends.
/me hugs
12Night
/me is squished by a BIG lugia
I completely trust this guy.
How the heck does that work?
those heels
....
this movie
06Gnite
why does this exist
03anyway bbl
And let's just face it: The Wii U will NOT have any other OS on it, Linux is the closest thing
Because Hollywood
needs money
Seriously, though. What does an ostensibly ten-year old looking boy do in a film like this?
Well, it's not Serbian Movie
If they really want a prostitute they should just give Paris Hilton a call, she's cheaper.
Serbian movie doesn't exist
wait what the kids are flashing
12However, Android makes apple suck
and what the fuck is that music
6I see you is playing Portal 2..
03^
It's the pedo music
lol.
goodnight lu =D
What
pedobear seal of approval.
nice red lighting
What
I wonder if the Amazon Tablet will run android
This is terrible.
this
what
If they ever release it
And I remember seeing adds for this on TV
How delightful
this movie never needed to exist
>Cigarettes
I wanna know how they advertized this
tbh, Android is a good operating system
This is very weird.... Glad I never seen this movie.
lol
Actually...
cause hookers borrow their pimps' cars all the time
... with pretty much the same scenes you see in this review
Well behaved, yeah, right
6So... what's everypony think of posting as a mod rainbow of "HAPPY BRONY APPRECIATION DAY!"?
god dang the chronicler is creepy
12[14:43] <HML-XD{GoD}> I wonder if the Amazon Tablet will run android <-- It probably will since almost everyone that’s not Apple runs Android
awkward hand shaking
"Hello, I'M a slut, and your son has seen me naked. You wanna fuck me?"
we have to coordinate this
math tutor?
Did that kid get Ed Harris a prostitute?
Hooker Anny! - Mister Naughty!
tgi fridays, gtfo
"kid, that's your mother!"
and do it after annuncements
6Which is why I'm bringing it up now.
"oh, you know each other"
WHAT
DID THEY
LOL
ha
they just went there
HAHA
I never even knew there were ads on TGWTG, Firefox is love.
6It would be in color order, and dari would end it with his rainbow writing.
12Hopefully it won't be windows
win
I know
Bye bye, enjoy hell
wooooow
But I don't want Milk Money in Florida.
Those girls
ok, so 6 people, right?
We need all the mods here to start with though.
is that toy story music?
>Chick not changing her dress for a week
and... plys her trade
dose gurls
/me waves
Stop looking at her like that
that was bad *derpface*
6We're missing DCD and Silver. *shrug*
Very, very, very bad
girls are so judgemental
okay.jpg
gawd.
=|
she spoke to meeee
12However, Amazon might make their own OS
having an entrance to mt. malefor
well, we can change around the colors
I'm his aunt
6We can still do it if they're not here though.
"I can hear you, you twerp."
Awkward smile.jpg
he's seen my tits
since pink isnt in the rainbow anyway
I watch this with sound off and it's STILL terrible
Haha
Anypony else hear "I heard that Curtis!" in their mind? XD
Oh my, after class!
6Well, there's no proper orange.
OOOoooooOOOoo
that'd be interesting...
I'm pretty sure
best line ever
...
that in the fifth grade
6It's just ugly brown.
Oral presentation
oral
I didn't know how the female reproductive cycle worked
close enough
12aOS
12XD
xD
Neither did I by that age
hooker through the window
i learned about that in elementary school
Are you serious?
what's the finale, she bursts out of a cake?
This movie I swear
:<
elementary school varies by country. Which grade?
i wish this happened in my health class
......
>Headrest
this movie needs to burn
fourth grade iirc
Rezo-chan, you're asking me?
....*facepalm*
did he draw boobs on her
...
holy crap
What the HELL
And yes
And lol, those girls
No
this is so wrong in so many wyas
a letter for every OS
He drew ovaries on her
those girls are lesbos
Prostitots
wOS
Everyone is bi in this school, apparently.
add #5 so far.
Prostitots is now in my vocabulary.
gOS
aOS, bOS, cOS
although bOSs would be nice
They had sex ed for us on fifth grade, and again on eight
Now we know our OSes
our sex ed in fifth grade was
like bOS S
6th & 7th for us.
'hormones suck'
yo bros, when the movies start
?
4th for us
'have fun in middle school'
It was vague
LOL
You know, I'm pretty sure most teachers have keys to their own classroom.
But it worked
In an hour and ten minutes, TVOTR
In a hour, TVOTE532
And lol
tvotr: 2 hours
12Handles programs like a boss
lol
this movie takes bad taste to new levels
The orange is good. O__o
lol elky
TITS!
Moms dead? Give her clothes to a prostitue
Unless it looks different on mibbit.
We actually had a copy of the school's master key circulating among us students.
We had plastic dicks in our eight grade sex ed, and girls had to put condoms on them
6Hey JLF
.....
Quite awkward, I must say
It was... Useful
6It looks light brown.
hahahahh
1 hour til ponies, 2 hours till movies
hey
LOL
wooow
that's because it would be one
6How are ya? :P
nuuh
I think our school gave up
6I know it's "dark orange"
I've never seen The Godfather
It's not dark orange on my screen.
O_o
sOS ?
awkward

xhjghjfjhggkgt,uik

My name is V, like the letter
6Gah..When will BlameTruth put a new video up? D:
hahaha, the godfather rocks
LOL
It'll be nice to finally see it
6hsrtyuru?
6Well, it would be nice if either Silver or DCD came online...
during formal training for civil service our class of all 18ys old had a hot instructor on health issues who demonstrated condom use on a banana
never
so they go up to the treehouse
and have sex
6Why? D:<
....
Okay
What?
So how does that work?
thentheyallfucked.jpg
silver isnt gonna be on cuz of the dialup
most likely
What.
this movie is so bad
6I know.
nOS
not funny bad
also
then casually played with the rubber clad condom, resting it on her shulder and all went like <3 <3 <3
dOS
unpleasant bad
LOL
Ds OS
6I wanna see moar Pokemon White by him ._.
I'll give A+ for the stupidity in the dialogue
How long before someone chooses this movie for Brony Move Night.

i wonder when he'll put up more pokemon white
6He nearly made me choke once..

Would Clockwork Orange be TOO violent for BMN?
SOC OP!!
what're you what're you
I'm not much of a movie goer anyway
I still don't even know who "Trejo" is
going to- DO
what do we do if someone picks wicker man or vampires kiss?
The nineties were a horrible time for romantic comedies.
Clockwork Orange isn't that violant
... Well, all tiems are horrible for romantic comedies
6With that last episode with the alien pokemon in Dragonspiral tower :P
4Tell em no lol
Never seen Clockwork Orange myself
little kids driving?
my hand is a dolphin
12The OS on the DSi and 3DS are pretty awesome actually
why the heck am I being changed so much?
The Mythbusters must be driving the car....
we pretty much have to tell them if it happens
Clockwork Orange is just...Strange.
wow
brb bros gotta get a smoke
yea
Sweet
i want a dolphin
3D(O)S is pretty good
I'm glad to know that hookers can just retire any time they want
This is a stupid plot point
Yet, I love it
7is there something planned with those 2 movies?
right to do anything he pleases
save the mud.
4Yes

Brony day NEVER ends, so sayeth our holy lady of pink!
This is just the day when everyone acknowledges it
HAH

True dat
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million Fluttershys
Flew in the room as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And their squeaking everywhere
Would be so cute
That I would just stand and smile
YEs! I love this song!

3:07:56] <Global> [>> $*.irchighway.net] Hi, we've done some reroutes, which has been the cause of the recent splits. Everything should be back to normal now. Thank you!

True, true
both movies are just like dances with wolves
>mfw the only disney movies I ever watched are Lion King and Aladdin a few weeks ago
Bleh, Avatar(the movie) sucks.
also
6THEY'RE DIFFERENT FROM US, WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T BE TRUSTED
but I'm pretty sure it doesn't end with the white dudes taking all the indians' land
Has anyone requested "Nick Cage Losing His Shit" yet?
So, um, will Silver show up this week?
those apples have smallpox!
brb, picking up my food

6Likely not, Dermathil
alright
Then I'll request
I actually liked Avatar, sure it's unoriginal but there's a reason the saying "There is nothing new under the sun." exists.
why though?
I liked the humans in Avatar
darnit.
I wanted them to win
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP1-oquwoL8
'ALl' disney movies are tripledigits, AFAIK
6ALWAYS
I have never seen Avatar
because the smurfs were so damn smug

I thought Avatar was ok
Yeah, that's the B movie.
DSNesmith: Me too
We watch one good, one hillariously bad.
/me 6gives a sigh of relief.
Was already planning on playing it.
nostalgia critic reviewed it
Avatar bored me
although the ending is hilarious
they let the humans leave
Yeah, it's a really good popcorn movie.
14thanks drf :>
which means they'll be back with orbital cannons and nukes
03no problem

Background material suggests strongly that earth government /likes/ the smurfs. It's only the corporation that wants them dead, United Fruit COmpany like
I loved Quaritch though
he's such a ham
6Wtf
Pony and the Beast.
What's this, then?
disneypony night?
Beauty and the Beast?
me gusta
Alrighty
IS EVERY DISNEY SONG A PONY MUSIC VIDEO?
DO YOU EAT?
:D I see I'm not the only one who thought of this song in ep 1
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shw3lYC6DsY
so 'Gotta Share' was a terrible song
but that dance
wait, is this the melody the trolling song is based off?
I think so, marewhoarrangestheblocks
Lol, I keep telling suinide I'm against gay Marrige
huh
Ive just realised how much I like Disney
huh, you're right elky
I never realized that
derpy :D
I think every song period is a PMV
6NO
wow, nice find elky
6o.o
I'd like to see a 2112 PMV
The glory of Van Canto should be shared
That would be enetertaining
12We all have something were doing in our nick names XD
6I need to find some Aladdin PMVs...
Rule 32 of the Ponynet, there is Pony of it, no exceptions.
we've gotta see a hellfire PMV
with Rainbow singing about twilight
oh god no
spyro eternal night
Yup
Exactly, Dee_Twenty
not that aladdin ytp
what, they made Rarity the old teapot? D:
6Aaa..which place exactly? :P
just beat the assassin
actually being a shadow lugia wouldnt that make you a dark type which is weak to fighting types?
xD
hehe, voice matches the glasses
"Thank the Lord" Not every day you hear that in a Disney movie, other than HoND
dari, you shoul post a better version of nyan dash
and HoND is decidedly ironic
6Can't play it. We don't play music videos that aren't ponies... it ends up controversial.
Hipster_Brony: I like the GIF versions.
6Sorry Purple.
I'll admit, the song fits
Not the ones with actual clips from the show.
8i was humming winter wrap up while signing the receipt for my food and i didnt even realize it...
When is movie night?

the five stages of grief with Nicholas Cage
At least we'll have hoverboards in 3 years
;p
12who knows when they actually began filming it :P
stage one: rage
6THEY'RE IN MY EYES
INsertCupcake: pensivepony's youtube, I'd say
they'll start showing the episodes before they've finished them all, so likely in october
Yeah
stage two: rage
AHHH
stage 3: losing shit
Maybe two years before? XD
InsertCupcakes, torrents will probably come soon
Ouch
03hoverboards? Try flying cars
Or whoever has them in 22 minute format
stage 4: angrish
stage 5: flopping around
I seriously cringe whenever I see that bee scene
8nelly, did you just get back from your smoke?
We already have glasses-less 3D!
this is like the 5 stages of learning to like MLP
I think they began accepting ideas for the time machine shortly after the DeLorean was released in 1981
Stage five: Black paint
What part of the non-US world are you from, Cupcake?

Trolls basically flagged the Brony facebook page as spam, and it got deleted. Just when they got 4K likes, too
Oh god
:P
not cynder's
Oh god, no
That's my favorite one
06But then again, some things do not have to be claimed that way~
Elky: You'll see when his request comes up.

rarity isn't abusive D:
8>mfw facebook page gets wiped: http://i.imgur.com/LUOxB.jpg

Nintendo, me neither
6>mfw facebook page wiped
WUT

Still, rather retarded from FB's part

Go go pony rangers!

Hipster_Brony: did someone say SPiderman thread
the blank generation
/me eats cheese :D
i dunno
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC32j1TIJRg
nommy cheese
Its a case of trollism similar to the removal of the episodes from YTube
6these espeons, they come in pairs
My face is text
(I'm just saying that because I have no friends)
Kill Applejack D:
i wonder if his mom cracked down on ponies
A real man
6Dunno...
lol I put derelle over my profile pic
What kind of cheese are you?
God how I love that small theme
So do the umbreons
This movie
?
restart on Google+, they prolly won't do such a bad publicity stunt
I should watch it again
4No one's spoken to him?
12[15:36] <Pattyrick> What kind of cheese are you? <-- The kind Espeons like :3
06Claim one get one for free.
06It seems
You've got so many requests piled up Sprinkles. XD
no google+. sry but im not movin to that shit
Welp, still not interested in social sites
is this the movie with the scary tunnel
Swiss?

There's no earthly way of knowing
English :p
Which direction we are going
that'd be interesting
Rape
/me 6imagines a world where you claim an exponentially growing number of espeons
6Most of them won't get played due to time.
EPIC SAX
epic spike guy
spike bulge 0.0
shame there's no more legend of
Epic Spike, sweet
Oo
first 2
/me 6imagines said espeons in a sea of espeons
Epic sax Spike is win.
Dat stomach
needs more gummy gif
lololol
then 4
THE FIRES OF HELL ARE GLOWING!
Aurora is dreaming again :p
then 16
6so many espeons
the new spyro looks dumb
ladies and gentlemen!
12Then 32
where is harvey dent!?
I can only handle 2^32 espeons
suddenly, there is a whole floofpile of Espeons as large as Kansas
anyone heard the Pendulum song of the scary tunnel?
I love that remix
harvey dent is good at hide and go seek
I agree
Big question is, where do all the espeons come from?
I also heard that facebook got an automated system. Dunno if true, tho

SPAAACE
pink? PINK? piiiiiink
Man I listened to Limp Bizkit when I was in 1st grade :D
I wish more people took art requests D:
they came from....
Pinkie, I'm in space
Germany
06A sea of Espeons.
READ A BOK
someone needs to mod a pinkie sphere into P2
READ A BOOK
Okay, I'll read a book, sheesh
READ A MOTHERFUCKING BOOK
Oh yes
OH YES.
That's win.
Pinkie Panther
I'm glad poniator
12= A sea of Floof
who's spyro's voice in that one?
we have to play pinkiequest if we get posted before the show starts though
/me loved the pink panther
^
the new one
6Wow..I downloaded something and now Chrome tells me it'll need another 532 to finish downloading..
Espeon + Umbreon = Esbreon
I would watch this.
6a sea of espeons, glorious
wow chrome
6but anyways
fail
Pink Panther FTW
I still want a Pink Pony episode in S2.
6*532 days
O.O
wth
I... can see that working
who COVERED the spice girls?
I wish they could hold an OC contest.
Can you draw us a sea of espeons?
what would an Esbreon look like?
8Dee_Twenty: pinkie has had plenty of episodes
classy spike
DSNesmith: I know right?
i think i read somewhere spyro's next voice actor will be rob paulsen
There's ALREADY a pinkie sphere. I think its a reskin of Wheatley.
that spice girls song is hell of a guilty pleasure
6Yeah..I think I can wait for another 1,5 year..
8Dash needs more of them
6Oh, definitely.
Spike is now dead
haha
RIP
6Who's he?
too many episodes with no dash.
he's on jimmy neutron
Spike needs his own spin off.
She feels caring <3
Dash needs more songs
he voices carl
6...
I think AJ needs more love tbh
i feel like playing a quick game of empire total war while i wait for godfather
The point of a pink pony episode would be to reference the classic pink panther cartoons, I think. Which WOULD be awesome
6I think I drew one before. Ovo
8 1 episode with no Dash is too many
6I think.
what ds said
space
Out of the mane 6, Dash has the least screentime. Its been COUNTED>
6I need to draw all the falseons we've come up with in this channel
...
Oh yes
Hipster_Brony: Yes, but she hasn't hand any Pink Pony style episodes with no dialogue, just slapstick and catchy music.
NAAAAAAAAAAATUUUUUUUUUUURE!
Hipster: Look before you sleep
and back
Pinkie and Dash should do a duet song
6I'm playing It's Friday Night before the mane 7 PM showing.
My EARS
Vapespeon
you eat pieces of shit for breakfast ololol
8thats my point Dermathil
derma: literal screen time doesn't equal focus on a pony
6And You Are A Pirate, because it's our official New Mod song.
Sonic b-
AJ and Dash should do a duet :D
or fighting type
oh this
hah
...
aww yeaaaaaaaah
ima say something i always say in here, rainbow pony s best pony
EAT SHIT
fluttershy, you so naughty
6Y'know, it might've been a long time ago I made that sprite up.
Elky: I know.
eat shit, mister bear
8need a Dash solo song is S2
and he's imaginary gary on fairly oddparents
I want someone to hax Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition
agreed.
Lawl
This sounds like Offspring too
Agreed, Hipster.
^^^
Fuck you Mr bunny.
So that Sonic booms are rainbow colored and all
I wish people actually listened to things I said...
6o.o
Hipster_Brony: How about 2?
The day when he stops smiling is the day we remember his smile
8well, yeah
6I think Veyka counts enough as an Espeon/Umbreon mix.
heheeh i demand tp for my bunghole
Yeah it's hard when there's so many people
Up yours Mr bear
xD
6I think I'll take that for an SCS just cause it's random.
8i would be fine if every episode had a Dash song
something to think of though: What would make Dash break into a solo song?
ok
I doubt the allcaps things works either D:
06Flarjoltporeon.
Meh.
Asleigh ball signing ponies
and me, well i BLAHHHH!
Dash is meh.
6Awesome..Dari,Icy,keep it up pl0x. ^^
did anyone see fairly odd movie?
06And yes, he does.
that was amazing
the gokaiger version, right?
that pie take cracks me up everytime
DAT B-BIT
Come on, OC contest... anybody?
6Yeah.
REZO
LOL oc
NO
6Nope..
I saw a bit of it
>Implying I have talent
06Twice the fun, in another way
6Might actually play Pinkie Quest then instead.
Pitch that idea to Equestria Daily or so
Would it be that bad?
Dash is epic. rezo ಠ_ಠ
lol
why do people hat OCs?
6Since it's a 16 minute gap...
anyone singing along?
if there was a fighting type eveelution it should be called
6HELLS TO THE YEAH. 567 days left
hate?
Puncheon
Yeah, what's wrong with OCs?
I don't hate OC
How big is the download?
Rainbow Pony is least best pony.
/me is tomato'd in the face
aw, dammit. i missed Anthologies?
I appreciate that stuff, and hell, I've got my own.
I just can't CREATE THE STUFF
because sonic
DEE
Dash is a bogstandard female jock character the likes of which have been dime a dozen for the past two decades. Sorry.
http://i.imgur.com/8kx2B.jpg
and furries
NEIN
6 701 MB
Eh, I prefer canon characters than OCs
because my fingers are for strictly gaming
Rainbow Pony is always best pony.
/me aura spheres tomato thrower
I don't haate OCs either. They can be done well, but it's just that they so rarely are
Nothing wrong with OCs, people just hate Mary Sues/Gary Stues.
Since you don't really know OCs so well
6I don't care about it really..
/me gets tomatoed back
/me pokes
it was good
Pink Pony is best pony.
Just give them flaws.
4DCD gives his regards
just like the cartoon
Okay
And they won't be Mary Sues.
8Rainbow pony is best pony, anyone who says otherwise is bad and should feel bad
rainbow pony s best pony
Meh
My OC is an Alicorn, he's Luna's younger sister, but he hates being this beautiful and having so much power, more than the princesses
My pony is weak to color yellow
Is FO:E an example of well-made OCs?
When I made my RP character, I took my persona
yes
it is
ok
didn't care much about the cartoon
best pony is the one with a perfectly coifed mane
4Vinyl Scratch is best pony. I don't feel bad at all
and ripped one of his arms off
Eee-up, Derma
agreed Hipster
/me does not feel bad for thinking that Rarity pony is the bestest pony of all time.
did he say anything else
MrPoniator: Ponified Green Lantern then.
That counts as a flaw, right?
?
Too many OCS that act all innocent and unworthy in pony fanfics is my problem with them
Rainbow Pony doesn't have a song about being best pony like Pink Pony. :p
inb4 HASBRO
lol wat
still can't believe Tara Strong voices Timmy
I see Ghosties be Ghostin' again...
>Ripped arm off
Why do I like Lyra so much?
Yeah
I just realized
I'll make my OC a psychopath killer
8i love that jumping dash sprite
He's one-armed
I know all the lyrics to Winter Wrap Up
Bwahahahaha
Rainbow pony broke the sound barrier so hard the excess energy folded over into the visible spectrum
like a boss
6Anyway..I started it some hours ago..I have two of the same downloading..the 567 day one has downloaded 0.1 MBs and the other one,which is 121 days left has gotten 0.5 MBs..
Because she's the best pony, Cupcake :D
Might get a robotic appendage later, if I get the chance
like a bawss
Oh, and wings.
She's like HTC phones: quietly brilliant
Why did I read that as visible rectum? XD
...
I've always wanted wings
Wow.
rofl
I can't believe I just spent brony appreciation day stuck in a doctor's office... :/
has someone done a PMV of Michael Bolton Jack Sparrow yet?
she voices dil
Thank you Jesus
and bubbles
we need OC because they are not enough male characters in the show
VISIBLE PLOT
I commissioned someone once for a big pic with my OC and other characters xD
You look freaking majestic with wings
And my OC is male.
6Dammit Sethisto, we're about to start...
Dee_Twenty: Thanks for the mental image. >_>
She was Kaede in Killer 7
lol hangover chicken
8im hoping that will change in season 2
ow
You're welcome. :p
Don't scare me, fluttershy
8now that hasbro knows they have male fans
(oh and if it isn't clear my character's humanoid)
6Hangover chicken? o.o
/me is okay with lotsa girl ponies.
There is a vast number of male OCs to cover the bases left uncovered by the vast majority of female background ponies.
nothing we can really do now
Dat music
Nine Filly Tails
I agree with Rezo
i'm watching the hangover
6Got bored of playing Portal? :P
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
i kinda like the mojarity being female
i love portal
i dont mind all the plot in S1
Title: Naruto derp song I bet
Someone told me that it's because it parallels real life, when males
in retrospect, i should have given him a heads up yesterday that we were starting earlier
Hmm, intriguing.
what kind of background should I draw for my Zebstrika picture to give the feeling of 'The Plains'?
mate with a whole bunch of females.
anyone played Killer 7?
Bubbles? They be on Derpy's butt.
What?
dari: is that bjornfot's request?
ewww billy ray cyrus
I like the idea of Equestria being a matriarchal society
Elky: No.
because it's pretty cool so far
6I don't think I've even heard of it..
Adds to the depth of the world
Holy shit MASH is on it 15 minutes
6D:
6Probably, but... *shrug*
I don't think Equestria's Matriarchal
Elky: You'll know when you see Bjornfot's request.
so much as Monarchial
There is something fundamentally wrong with equestria (I dont know how to do Links)
i wanna see harry potter 7 part 2
wheres king celestia?

aw, damn, my ears
A hill
Maybe
ow
Its made by the same people who made No More Heros
8dammit, we arent actually showing that, are we, dari?
we probably won't have sexy naughty bitchy Rarity then?
/me thinks of it as a show that's focussing on a group of girls, and their antics. Other demographics are consequently peripheral.
^love that one
6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
Lawl.
I can bet the original song of this thing's called Nine Fox tails
Celestia's not even a pony, she's an avatar of the sun.
haha

Anyways, Imma go.

that was a terrible idea
WhatPayne: this is going to be one hell of a night
/me just got a hug off his mom

Ah well, at least the power surged during a song I don't like anyway instead of Fluttershys or the movies or something.

pony_yay We have gazed into the bowels of bad movies by way of the Room and Spider's Web, NOTHING is too bad for us.
Icy: Finally men's MLP shirts got released, and yes C7.
Michal Bay ruined the franchise for me
8that movie gave me cancer
4Also, I know I'm a bit late
nnnnnope
I'm gunna get one. :>
4But funfact
dee_twenty
8several times in fact
baby geniuses is not a movie
With Jurassic Bark and Luck of the Fryrish inbetween
9 minuts omigoshomigoshomigosh
4My name comes from Nine Inch Nails
it is an abomination
02I totaly didn't forget that I have this game |D
YES
Well that's a bit shallow don't you think?
I can't imagine something worse than spider's web
rarity is BEST PONY
Hell no i fucking hate Call of Duty
ONE DAY WE NEED TO WATCH SPIDERS WEB AGAIN JUST CAUSE
Fuck yes
I do
6That's what it was.
I liked watching Spider's Web a lot more then the Raaom
6Oooh..Icy and Dari in MLP shirts? FTW
oh, it was finals week
NONONON
DAT RARITY
Yay
I can't play it :<
YEAH
makes sense then
NO, MAREWHOARRANGESTHEBLOCKS
9 more mins until Brony Appreciation Day Special! :)
foot stamp
6I knew he had given me a reason when he said he might not make it.
JUST NO.
Rarity is fine
rarity wins everything
Im not aware of this Spiders web stuff
6Hooray for Dari having CoD4!
I'm only disturbed by her make-up in Sonic Rainboom ep
Link mah boi
Why do ponies make even the shittiest songs tolerable?
6Aah.. D:
yeah that was not her best fashion choice
These nick changes are a pain
well i'll see everyone later
bye
Ah BMN introduced me to this song bc it fits so well to Rarity
agreed
6D:
CoD 4 campaign was awesome.
6Bai..
Cya.
byez
lmfao
6Yeah..
I used to hate this song
someone has my link nick
Rairity knows how to handle herself in public unlike most women
then rarity sang it
suddenly it was cool
Besides, I really don't see whythe movies are that bad, not perfect but not bad
buts reg'd by me ;pp
3hey I'm Nick so its ok if I Nick change right?
/me 3is beaten with wand of Gamelon
DSN exactly!
Ponies make all songs better.
ponies can even make Katy Perry sound good
6The maps in multiplayer are quite good too..
Pretty much
Rarity does that to everything she touches.
Never heard this song before this video. Now I actually like it. Weird huh?
sorry SS
Ponies make everything 20% cooler
I didn't know the song before the PMV, but this is my favourite one.
6I love Wet Work.. :3
ponies make 99% of terrible songs good
Nuu its fine
8DSNesmith: nope.avi
you can use it XD
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVq2sCvtOHc
6No Soarin... : /
you know what? We really gotta start to delve in the IMDb Top 250 to redeem our eyes for Spider's web.
/me doesnt care
Bad humor numerous plotholes annoying charcters the list goes on
lol
8tolerable, but not good
just noticed it was reg'd
Maybe ponies could even make Friday good, but thinking about it 20% of 0 is still 0.
XD
Guile's theme doesn't go with Ponies. Ponies go with Guile
oh come on, Equestria Girls was fantastic
lol
Nothing can make friday sound good
Hipster_Brony: You didn't like Equestria Girls?
I have the wingest boner.
4Purple'Prose
but yeah after playing OoT and then finishing it I dl'd link's awakening
damn, you know what I'd like to see
8lol guys, you can stop requesting things
4That user I like
Rarity vs. Fluttershy
8its 7 minutes to showtime
in a passive aggressive battle for the ages
That was pretty much the highlight of my year for the shoutouts. I love it.
What's wrong with Friday? It's not my favourite day of the week but it's no Sunday.
my zelda needs cannot be quenched atm
wait, PurpleProse is around?
8dari: tolerable, not good
4Oh well
Yes
Fluttershy would win
ooh nicee
Wow, hard to please much? O_o
4I don't blame him for not being around...then again, we did get everything fixed
Oh we're about to start?
I agree with dari, it was awesome
8the fact that it wasnt katy perry helped
xD
/me throws Triforce and a random chicken at Linkario
4OH
Derm: why?
4Guys
The humor was really toned down in dotm, the plothole were lessend, the characters, no matter how minor served some kind of purpose
D@
D:
8katy perry is fucking terrible
was that a script Pattyrick? o.o
no
4Did Sprinkles tell you about that an incident with Metal_Link after we interviewed Sathi?
12NICK!

cos that was a fast reply
Hi Arti =D

Aww

Hipster isnt mad but is da truth
Minecraft, wut
oooo whats thie eh?
YESH MINECRAFT

Hipster! What a terrible thing to say! Apologise to all the fucking terrible singers out there for comparing them to Katy Perry.
8i aint even mad
Oh, sweet

DAT REDSTONE
pretty epic
8katy perry is just awful

4Metal_Link posted a wall of text in the main room about the interview
Dat piano cover :D
Wow, someone put a lot of time into that. O______o
6Hmm, Rora?
Wish I had the patience to compose like that in Minecraft
6yes?
IT TAKES ME LIKE 5 MINS TO GET BACK IN CHAT, DONT BAN ME
hipster_brony agreed but i still love Equestria girls
weh, sound bleh
best part is that he transposed this by ear
I've done a few simple melodies, but nothing like this
8its ok
To be honest I think he was putting it on a lot.
8i liked the iphone commercial more
but I just remembered, anyone who saw the intro to movie 8 did they feel a slight zelda overtone with Sir Aaron and the princess in the film?
that made me lol so much
typical hipster
4HaxBrony: And the only way Equestria Girls is likeable is if it's featuring Nigel Thornberry
still, Equestria Girls was when Hasbro went
'lol bronies sup'
Not gonna argue there, but I like how they were in the book
I cant deal with Katy Perry enough to watch equestria girls with a smile Ponys or not
Blaaarg!
for dotm
Hipster_Brony: iphone commercial was awesome
12SORRY
I do, now that you mention it xD
12was talking to RN ^v^
6D:
6Oh.
i dun get this Nigel Thornberry nonsense
not hasbro, the hub
I don't get it, why are we looking at boxes with a cover of Winter Wrapup playing? o_O
he was being pissy since we decided not to interview him after he missed 3 interviews
"so what if I would have gotten thrown out of the house if I didn't do what my dad said"? That seems put on to me.
ELLO' IM NIGEL THORNBARRY
DSNesmith: that's the Hub's ad team
12Want to dsicuss anything about tomorrow ?
DUDE, MURPH, TEENAGE DREAM KICKS ASS
ah
still
oh wow, tomorrow's the meet
Hasbro ~ The Hub
Dee
It's MINECRAFT
SMASHING
Dee_Twenty the boxes ARE the song.
Hello everypony! Happy Brony Appreciation day!
I actually had a dream last week of the intro but it was Link sealing Lucario in the Master Sword then I woke up ><
man how time passes xD
they weren't in the movie though
6dunno
8nelly: no bro
Dee_Twenty, that's how it looks like when you make a giant jukebox in Minecraft
6What's dotm?
/me brohoofs all
sup TGP
6Well, Rora, I, and you are all online.
Ghosties: Seriously? You too? O__o
6I'm not much of a spriter
This is actually wired up. It's a giant virtual music box.
Same to you, TGPFluttershy :D
and arti not sure I Know all the times and stuff now
8that song and album is pure shit
6Well, in general?
who else besides hasrbo owns the HUB?
4Yeah
6So about that tally...
but if you're wonderwing where the gallery is its only across a bridge
all the mods in this stram are CRAZY
4He was acting like a drama queen
uh
12Ok thats fine Nick ^^
except dari
didn't they merge it with somehting
12Yeh RN told me, and I read your post
>Implying I should know anything about a boring Lego game.
HUB
if there is anything Lucario related I want a picture of it :P
12Quan, huh?
bark at the moon
DISCOVERY CHANNEL?
where's rainbro by the way?
I don't see how anyone can think Equestria Girls is just average considering the acknowledgement they gave us.
it used to be something else I think
im actually glad that happened though
4Yes, dari
It was FREAKING AWESOME.
Dee_Twenty: the boxes are noteblocks.
oh yes there was something I wanted to ask PMPMPMPMPMPMPMPMPMPMPM
is what i like to call it
4Equestria Girls is ONLY good when Nigel Thornberry is in it
better to have it happen then than if we had hired him
Dee_Twenty you shut your whore mouth
6I've polled the IRC members of TST about a recent issue.
12OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK
I don't like the Nigel Thornberry version.
It's stupid.
10Ghosties is right
12Oh?
6That about the moderatorship of DRF.
ohai RainBroDash
Nigel Thornberry meme confuses me
12Oh not THIS again >v<
How are ya today
NPNPNPNPNPNPNPNPNPNP
I always hated that show when it was on
idk, but in the book, they die protecting bubblebee
I don't get Minecrafts appeal.
Ruining something awesome that was meant specifically for us.
We need pony mob mod for Minecraft
Ghosteis just be Ghostin'...
6Ozzy ftw!
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
It should be Dark SIDE of the Moon but Michal Bayis retartded so
6Well, in short, a majority of the members want to see him de-modded.
Someone put way too much work into this.
dari is right you know
8nigel is the best part of wild thornberries
12Did you ask them all by PM or is there an actual poll somewhere? lol
Make pigs ponies or something
*retarded
it becomes more and more clear that dari is the only sane mod
6:O
So I can ride them
6PM. :P
olol
Blaaaarg
:U
Everyone knows I'm best mod. :P
:p
4Yep

This show made my balls fall off, and then grow back twice as large.

poor spike
dari: Are they all named Gary, though?
dat BG music
Aponymous LOL
Why is Lyra in Canterlot?
10@TGP I hear that brother
Poor Spike....
spike spiegel
I realized that I grew a moustache while watching this show
ninjad by dragonrage
4That's why there's so little viewers. Alright, cool
What did you do with the old balls, Aponymous?
he always emails me and get a desktop update
so is it just me or does spike sound really young in this episode?
Lyra gets around.
Real reason she doesn't want to go to Moondancers party is because she doesn't want to see her moon dance.
she missed her birthday lol
They shrivelled and died.
I think it was intentional, DSN
Lyra is actually a secret agent working for Celestia. Her mission is to spy on Twilight to make sure she doesn't goof off instead of learning about friendship.
lol gimmi dat spike
MFW stream is skipping all over the place.
So I threw them out.
To establish a sense of chronology
hm, so how long IS season one?
Makes sense
4Easter Egg coming up
like, chronologically
9 hours somethin
no, I mean in-universe
'bout a year?
9:58 minutes
cause they go through winter and then fall in the next ep
DAMN
Ghosties: When you see it...
9:58 hours
we know, Ghosties. I spotted the Rocky one in Bird in the Hoof
there's a hole in my coffee pot
lol, watch the hourglass
the episodes are non-chronological
It probably is about a year, or just under a year
Isn't it kinda sad that Princess Luna only was a mare's tale?

8Ghosties: everything goes better with that sound effect
Everfree Forest is scary because physics apply there.
Rainbow is dumbest pony
Fluttershy good flier, does not compute.
Why, Dash, why?
And thus did Dashie Pie get started.
If you think about it,if Twilight had gone alone, she'd probably be dead with the first trap
Dammit Ghosties...
Let go, I promise you won't die!
Trust MEEEEEE!

I think we all learned a valuable lesson. The magic of friendship is... Traffic cone.
sathi says brony
dude where did you get Deathstalker II? I can't find a DVD of it ANYWHERE
Rainbow dash is too cocky
6Ghosties, you'd say Happy, then Sathi says Brony, then Hipster says Day, etc.
Bjornfot and WhatPayne my background too!
:/
its like 3 things at once!
I have Pinkamina as mine.
Is Sathi here or AFK?
never watched the Godfather, so this aught to be good
13Calm down everybody.
7i'm here
I have pinkie eating her tail on mine
10coffeegrunt (and all other EU bronies) I'm here for you <3 I know how it feels to have no bronies around where you live, EU for the loss :P
4That's what I expected :P
4But alright
I'm calm
21
lol, not quite sprinkels
LUNA WITH SOCKS IS BEST LUNA
The magic of friendship is where Nanoha learned everything there is to know about making new friends.

I'm so calm i'm hyperventilating
I spy with my little eye something that is blue.
I
4Wait
4what?
6How not quite?
3wait
4Then what are we doing?
I have yet to meet another Brit brony irl. Ti's a sad existence
I got vinyl scratch as my background
3what do I say then?
7was a paedophile?
I'm a southern brony
Ooh! I love guessing games!
wait gotta piss
ok, does everyone know what they are writing and in the correct order?
@ rainbrodash at least u dont get any Pony Live shows in your cities

English Bronies represent
how long is this Godfather movie?
7rather
Luna + socks + abacus + microwave = CUTESPLOSION
...
RainBroDash, you... heretic!
7eeeyup
3YES.
3YES WE DO.
like 3 hours
RainBroDash: Hey, I be living in the French Canadian province of Quebec. The only brony I know is my bro. Yeah. sucks over here.
10erm
Right now I have Luna raising the moon as my background.
Is it... Queen Meanie?
So I'm last, what do I say?
6...lol I meant Apprciation from Hipster
10nope
BMN intermission? better drink my own piss
10.
6Aah..
LunaXAbacus OTP!
Fluttershy is the best pony >:3
10What do I say
Pokey Smokes
4Aw
7I don't know who Latias Fan is, but I like them
Also need everypony's opinion. Trixie X Pinkie. Would you read this?
4Ah
oh, and dari, write the whole thing in rainbow text after we finish
0about 8 hours
7I feel rather redundant
nah
Trinkie?
@dmitrikarov that's not how you spell rainbow dash
no
Holy crack pairing batman
4We need the order
6Yeah, that.
@amerelurker yes?
Eh. I still have Optimus Prime as my background.
6He was on here earlier
I would
oh yes coffeegrunt
if the writing's good,then sure
0that's how long the Godfather is
Rainbow dash is EVEL
Ok.
3I need to know what I'm gonna say
no, crack pairing would be
>:3
0Trixie x Twilight
ok
RainBroDash, I just realized I haven't met another Brony irl.
Depends on how well it's written
how would that work?
Lunabby?
no bronies around turn those around you into bronies.
coffee: not likely, it doesn't seem like a probable ship
they can make magic with parties!
Trinkie, doesn't sound believeable, but if you make it work...
stop for a sec
Sounds like Crack, CoffeGrunt. Probably.
Applejack x Madame LeFlour
It goes through a random rotation every few hours, so for all I know the next time I look at it it'll be that Repony wallpaper.
Trixie X Gummy
je'mappel Forderz je nes pas comprehende franqoius?
Lyra is the best non-mane (Pun) character
Ah good. I can make them probable
10dermathil canada doesn't count, it's too epic already
Trixlight Sparkie is a better pairing.
Luna+Socks=Rainbow Dash-Pinkie Pie>Trollestia
in this order:
Appleflour
twilight X Pinkie
Ghosties says Happy
Twilight + Pinkie Pie: Twinkies?
LYRA for the win
Gummy is the best pet I would say
I'd read AJ x Madame LeFlour
6Ghosties says Happy, then Sathi says Brony, Hipster says Appreciation, Peanut says Day, Rainbro says Every, I say Pony
10whatpayne i feel your pain dude ;_;
shipping fics that are just for the shipping are not stuff I read. If they are the side results of good fics like the pony psychology, then I can read.

I'm here everypony! YOu can all relax and start the party!
yay canada
6:O
i'm confused what is everyone talking about
Trinkie Pie's in progress. Annoyingly it took 3 chapters to develop Trixie to the point where she's compatible.
4Well, I know we were gonna do rainbow text; that's why I asked
6Everypony ready?
Elky: sick, sick dude :P
yes they bathe together
though from the calgary bronies: we're sorry about that live show event.
Someone needs to write a fanfic about the pets interacting
3yup

Sigh
10WAIT
Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe we're finally here! With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this the best night ever!
Angel is the red ranger?
Angel is the worst pet :3
If I was a rich brony I'd hire a plane to fly around Winnipeg with a giant Bridlemaids Banner flying behind it
so what're we waiting for anyway?
angel is a guy right?
0sorry i didnt know
4What's wrong?
10caps lock, capitals at start of each word, or caps at start of first word?
Sweetie Bell x Gaga Pony
Yep
@huffythemagicdragon yes

Holy time waster

4Alright
7Hmm. Latias handled the situation admirably.

Angel is the annoying robot bird thing EsppyLacopa
I'm thinking of the most insane pairings possible
RainBroDash don't forget your robe and wizard hat this time.
RainBroDash: I got a RocketLawnchair with a trajectory course ready for the moon. Don't even try.
brb
KNEW IT
Angel is evil
If I were a rich brony, I'd build an ORBITAL FRIENSHIP CANNON!
7anything I could say would be counter-productive
o hi dashite
Trolling bird is trolling!
Philomena x Bic Mac
If I was a rich brony, I'd bribe them to show me episodes
0Psychoshy=Pinkamena
GOKAIRE!
angel is awesome
Derp
Hey Elky
CoffeeGrunt: its called the HARMONY platform now.
Well, at least it isn't Angel the vampire.
/me is still hoping for an angel episode in season 2
lol
What?
If I were a rich brony I'd pay those MMO duders mad cash
Anyway being a tired brit brony with imminent work, I must sleep.
