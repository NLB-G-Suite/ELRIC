THAT'S why I watch you

I forgot I had my phone name
And that not everyone knows the difference
I always get depressed drawing something, and I can't physically hug it
I'd imagine, my room would be filled with plushies if I had that talent
And since I'm highly critical of pushes at stores

I've gotten too used to Sci-Fi shooters. TF2 just isn't fast-paced enough for my tastes.
Yeah, lol, same.
hehe
04I'm too used to Halo where everyone is the same
I play GG2 because it's more fun
in my opinion
I paid for my TF2 even
and I never play it
i'm used to classes
because of gg2 mostly
I prefer having everything under my belt and just whipping it out.
It's more convenient.
You know what's convenient?
Microwaves
it's a different style, it's not for everyone
i honestly like both styles
but seriously, they are pretty convenient
class-based and weapon-based
I prefer old-fashioned shooters, really.
makes cooking fast and bleh xD
at one point i played doom a lot

04Especially for getting the base shape.
Aww D=
7o.O

7Well, I'm unfortunately not a tablet expert.
14Now, I'm not sure if some idiot decided to replace my cables, or if it's just that the entire thing isn't working.
7Is it warranted?
14It's been over a year since I got it.
You never used it before?
14Pattyrick, hardly.
14Because I was always moving around and never was able to unpack it.
13Goodnight all :3
02Night Angel~
Goodnight AE =D
14Also, it's really hard to take out the cord too.
14But easy to plug in.
14Which I think is majorily off.
14And I'm going to be even angrier if my "sister" decided to barge into my room and touch my things.
14I'm going to try and search my room if there's another cord that happens to be hidden away somewhere.

Does Luna have a 3DS?
Nah, I'd never use it
Shame
I would not either
and its not a "shame" either
the system has not proven its self
Maybe if they came out with more good games
its still in the HEYZ LUK WEZ HAVE 3D!
stage
And the whole 3D stage is getting annoying
I don't understand why everything needs to be in 3D
is sort of pointless
except for VR
12then turn off the 3D
And don't whine?
:o
Well, I could get the anti-3D glasses off of Think Geek
It's difficult to turn off 3D when I live in it
Wut
They did

Close enough? lol
I was talking actual remakes, but I guess we can't have it all.
Netflix on the 3DS? O.o
Can it handle that?
Hurp derp
o_O
Yes
argh fuck
Netflix is basically screwing themselves over now
I knooow
Why?
by unbundling streaming and DVD rentals
:o
you have to pay for each one separately
?
its something like $6.99 a month for each one
actually no ESG is just being a fucker
the total I heard for having both is close to $17 a month

04Now I'm stuck and can't do anything - I'll have to go back and REMAKE MY CREATURE, REMAKE MY CIVILIZATION AND EVERYTHING
I don't know
Yeah
They're being bold
But I don't think it's going to matter much
Or just not pay at all, depending on the kind of people they are

03more than just some :/
I've talked to one of them
07if you always have something to say out of it when I use it not even knowing if you're gonna react to it
but not the others

that was a joke though :p
and the filter was an accident
I forgot to +o
er
ctrl + o
12Just like when NS used +m on drf

That was legit
because they were acting like idiots and dramatizing the channel
and they weren't stfu`ing
07eh?

only if you typed http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client
it'd translate to Quit:_This_is_my_graThe_trainer_blocked_the_ball!_l2_59_ERROR as the quit message instead

I made a pretty simple mIRC script the other day
then you do /startspam and then it continuously spams the channel using those clients, and the great thing about it is that it can do well over 100 lines without being killed for excess flood :D

7The first, 'realistic' reason, the first part of my dreams, was because another Illinois governor wanted to sell his seat. :U
LOL
7In this case, I have no idea why I had to crack on the computer, except to find some essential data.
wow
that's pretty interesting...
I wish I had dreams that were as interesting
I once had a dream about raising a Riolu
but I woke up just as it was evolving into Lucario D=
7I'm not done!
7When I was connecting (which resembled me travelling through some sort of warphole), I thought about a prankI could do, and mentioned it to my Emboar. My Emboar called on his cellphone(?) that I was coming.
7-l
7Now, my friends were on the staircase of this regal, Victorian hotel.
7Which happened to have this long air vent that was above the staircase and led right to them.
7)*
7NOW that ended.
7Crazy dream, eh?
Wow
I think I need to read it again to completely understand it xD
7Lol, okay.
7How much do you know about TF2?
04Well that was fun
Nothing
04Being the soldier is more fun than I though
7Ah.
7G, I think.
7But I use mouse3.
04mouse3 is clicking the mouse wheel isn't it?
06G
7Since the scroll wheel scrolls between weapons.
7Yep.
06default, at least
04Yeah, my mouse3 is buggered for some reason
04Can't even rotate in Spore: GA Adventure Creator anymore, which really makes it difficult
04And thanks Xeli
06And lol :3
7:/
04I want a wired mouse
/me shrugs
hmm
the time difference is weird
4Hello.
04I'm in Aus and Xeli is in Europe
Yup
Norway
04Well
but I'm from Washington
04I probably have an easier time than the both of you
yeah
I'm 9 hours ahead of the West Coast of the USA, 6 of the East, and probaby 7 or 8 behind Eastern Australia
6Oh my god...i haven`t been here in years....
04I'm GMT+10
04Figure that
7Ahem.
04wb Quan
04You're welcome
Hem Hem
Us talking about the time differences
6I don`t think if you remeber me but its me DarkCynder22~! v.v
04It's depressing
lol
brb
04Hey Quan
04Do you write alot?
7Write? Don't have time to, unfortunately.
04Ah
7Well, sort of.
7The sequel to a year-old fanfic.
7I have it incomplete. D:
04H-uh
7It was supposed to be done by the time BBS came out. XD
04...heh
04Missed that deadline
7I'd say 10000 words.
7About.
7I don't write novels.
04Hmm
04Well that's the complete opposite of me
04I really think I think about my stories too often
04My spyro fanfic alone is planned to have at least 4 books, each about 25 chapters long (with the last one being even longer) and several thousand words per chapter.
7Hmm.
04Whereas CoE and my future/sci-fi story...well, let's not even go there.
04I know it's gonna bite me in the @$$ one day though.
04I mean, the science/sci-fi one (I haven't thought up a good name for it yet) I'm looking around around 7 'books'
04Probably even more knowing my habit of expanding upon every single tidbit.
04And given how scientifically accurate I'm trying to make it...
7Try and make that story for NaNoWrMo. :P
04but hey, 7 books in a month? SURE /sarcasm
back
7I'm not sure how well this works for you, but here's an idea:
7Write the story in complete, but half-baked.
7Then go over it and edit it.
04Oh that would kill me
04Whenever I write, I push myself to make sure EVERYTHING is right, all continuities are correct, everything is explained properly (unless the plot calls for it) and that there are tiny little details like someone'se movements or the placement of an objects that hint at something in the future.
04...maybe
the Coca-Cola here in Italy is awesome
04...I also hate how I've basically MADE the LoS series my own ._.;
04Haha nice cut-in Pat
/me pats
lol, sorry
just had to say it xD
7o.o
7Eh, I had that dream I just spat out. :P
7Amazing how detailed they are, eh?
Yeah
7I could go on for a few more sentences about them.
7Should I? X3
and that you can remember them that vividly
sure, why not? xD
7All right.
I didn't hear the 2nd reason
7I like these vivid dreams, because unlike rather blurry, indistinct ones, they feel real.
7Your sense of logic and skepticism is rather suppressed in a dream.
04I never have really vivid dreams
mmmhmm
Same here
and even when I do, I never remember them =\
in fact
I had one that I knew was awesome, but I very sparesely remember it
04I remember having this one dream when I was really young, I was Chewbacca running away from droids through a primary school playground.
lol, Chewbacca xD
/me 7hmms.
Raaawww!
04Ah, good times.
And the droids
with their weird voices
'After him, NOOOOOWW!'
'Roger roger.'
What's a steampunk?
04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk
hmm
sorry for interrupting, I sometimes tend to do that without realizing it =|
/me 7lol'd.
04lol That's fine
04It's not like I don't do that
04OH I wasn't saying anything else
/me 7is alternating between this and spriting.
04But hey, psychics in a steampunk world - you gotta admit, that's pretty cool
7Indeed.

04H-uh

7And it's not really significant in any aspect. O_o

7I could argue tidbits in editing.
04Face is too long
04Horns are too thin
04wing isn't in the right position and has too many folds
7Eh, I don't know Spyro's style. :P
04Which hide the back and tailbase
7So it's okay to me.
04It's not spyro's style, it's my style.
04Admittedly, I stole a bit from CASF and other spyro artists but still...
04Oh, and the left (our left) paw is too large, and the arm is too concealed
gah, gtg

7Do you think, on dA, you could recommend me for a DD? XD
04...How do I do that?
7PM one of the gallery moderators about a suggestion (depending on the medium), and wait for a response.
04Ok then...
7http://help.deviantart.com/18/
04They need something simpler
7Well, we wouldn't want suggestion-spam. :P
04True there
04Sure. Is there a particular piece you'd like recommended?
7Do you think of any?
7Personally, I like Tynamo in Chargestone cave...
7Cave&
7Cave*
04Well I thought of that traditional image where the ball & chin was attached to you...

7How do I check how many people watch me?
04Um
04What?
04Why did that get a DD
7I know.
7Then again, emoticons get DDs.
7For example...
06In all categories
04Well
04Some emoticon DDs are deserving because of the great detail and effort put into them, especially that hospital one I saw a while back
7No, this one was very simple.

Why this?
Anyway
I broke my glasses today

Such misfortune for you :P
and why this transferring all over the place?
not all over the place
Yeah but
From Mayflower to Balestier Hill (if I remember correctly) and back to Mayflower
Why the transfer in the first place?
I made it in a rash decision,
because I was like, okay forget it. I had enough of this crap, then ya know. I transfered. Well I regretted it
Ich
yeah
and how've you been?
OK
Today was a bit suck though
I realised I can't have coffee without anything else
My body revolts

6Once he shows up I'm going to make him agree to never try anything like this again after this.
lol
aight
we should watch some actual shows or something, otherwise this is gonna be a boring pre-show
plus we dont want to blow through all the good PMVs before people start showing up
6I'll be reshowing any PMVs I've shown that are good. There's nopony here.
6I'm only showing PMVs I haven't seen before.

11Hello?

06Hm
is mibbit having troubles?
cant connect to irc via web
hi, are there really only three people in the room?
yea I was wondering that too
which is why I'm here too
Connection failed (Could not connect)
same here
let's hope its temporary
hm
hello :>
seems like we have technical troubles
most likely they changed servers without telling us
hm I see
or something
apparently
hope they get it sorted till the movies begin
Ahh, net split.
a*
hehe looks like it
7 why cant I set colours as standard in my client..
You probably need a script for it if you aren't using mibbit.
I'm using kvirc atm

does it have web support?
would it be able to handle about 300 people?
Elky: Yeah, that'd be the interesting part. ;)
Sathi: mIRC can connect to any server just fine.
Maybe it doesn't support SSL, I don't know, but I don't use SSL anyway.

He was saying the servers wouldn't reconnect until someone with access to the server came on.
4What does it mean
"20:41] -Global- webchat is down until someone with access to the server appears. Sorry for the inconvenience."
Then someone came on, and reconnected the servers.
not on this channel it seems
there you have the context
4So, do I need mIRC then?
When you use IRC a lot, you get used to net splits.

It might be able to handle 300 people.
You'd have to talk to the other guys
Nah.
Kind of hard when they aren't here.
My brain filters those things out.
I'll get on skype I suppose.

something like that espy
12People can't take a joke, it's really annoying
looks like mibbit is having issues again
Because Luna looks innocent. Adding cute, frilly socks just adds to it.

12I'm not sure whether there
You did nothing wrong
pfew I was worried for a moment
did this happen with mibbit before?
just to make sure, are you still there?
I don't think I've seen Luna in blue socks.
12ovO?
07o3o
I think I am...
well people cant connect atm, as the webclient cannot connect
i'm here via my own irc client
good to hear
6Well, Arti, I've been polling the TST IRC community over a certain subject.
That I'm aware of
6That subject being DRF's continued moderatorship.
I guess you can just simply use the same commands as always
Finally figured out this mIRC thing.
Well, why don't we just move the mibbit IRC to another server?
*shrugs*
I know one.
6A majority of the people polled state 'yes' for him to be de-modded.

07depends on the day I guess, but sometimes you can get them for....
07OW
6when did SJ/LA trips get that ridiculous
hmm
07WTF
03can't you just drive?
6they've NEVER been that high
07take amtrak
07:'D
6I really don't want to, but ugh
07who's going with you?
Ok.
03what's happening in LA?
I relocated the server, no net splits.
6the reason we probably wont drive is because he'd be driving
I'm not registered supposedly
6and didn't send my transcripts
14What?
14Wow
14Just wow
.
14That really really must suck
.
Wellllllll
6the only way to get them delivered in time (and to be sure they actually GET THERE), I'm going to deliver it in person
?
6um yeah
seems like the webchat is still separate
03ah
07can't you send a fax or an email or something?
07like
hm?
07while you're on the phone with them lol
14It took a lot of butt hauling to get those grades up
6no
Derp!
14Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to fax the transcripts or email them?
6the transcripts MUST be paper, in person, etc
6that's how transfering works
03policies are dumb
6they are
14well, when's the deadling?
14*deadline?
6july 8th
6:|
14to get it there for school?
6as of now, a hold is on my account
14holy friggin crap
14Well
6I can get the flight easily
6it's the fact that it takes time to process the request form..
6may, we have a prius, and we don't need a hotel
03as in, I've forged rebate forms before by opening the pdf file in something and editing it XD
03and if you were to fax it
03theoretically you could scan it and change Bs to As, etc
07when are you going?
6wednesday probably
14Well, why can't you drive?
6um
6so I'm not allowed to drive it

And huh, it's been a while since I saw the Godfather
wtf am I reading?
03ew, they put the dirty version of the song over the real one :/
03but yeah
03the intro mentions it
This is one of my favorite MB moments.
03and I swear I've heard it other places too, can't remember where offhand
I've never seen the godfather.
tbh I'm used to drinking 4$ wine
$9 Wine? that sound apealling in exactly 0 ways.
if we're talking about 0.75l here
Me neither.
/me does.
Which reminds me, I have a bottle of champagne.
Just gimme some soda, juice or something
I don't.
lol
Our airport is kinda low-tech and basic with everythin </random>L
lol
It's BAD
Wait which one is that?
*everything
G is great today
You'll see.
And huh
03LOL
Derp okay
but we only used old metal detectors and bag scans :D
couldn't you just do the math?
?
hint: coffee
14!weather 96007
Which reminds me...
I haven't made the second film for the past few weeks, but that's okay. I'm usually after the bad one <_<
I don't drink it, heh
Last week was epic.
caffeinated soda?
last week was great
14ew, that humidity
Caffeine is actually good for you I heard.
Yeah, last week was awesome.
Too low
Yes it was
0342
Humidity, rain and everything
in that case, you might be stuck with not being able to stay awake
03LOL
it might work...
03Best thing I've heard all day
Hmm?
6Meep, Draelen.
0,75 liter canister of caffeninated drink on hand.
7no worries
06Mays

Can't wait to see Battlefield Earth. heard it was hilarious.
14eh

14someone kill May
BE is amazing
6'Jesp is now playing -'.
I'll have my head tilted throughout Battlefield Earth
the dialogue is impossibly bad
/me kills May
but I haven't seen it either and don't care
Better/
the tongue scene
8HOW HAVE PEOPLE NOT SEEN THE GODFATHER?!
I've never seen it D:
ZOOM
6Lol.

:<
spiiiiderssss
Man-animal!
/me wasn't overly impressed by whatsitsname... the one playing in Miami and covering cubans, either
14I guess I can ghostkill
Oh wait, NC did a review on it?
14it won't let me
yeah
:<
Bawww
it's a good one too
yup
Huh, can't remember it, then
Already seen NC's review of BE.
Spoony stole the show on that one
ive actually never seen BE, just the NC review of it
14fffffff I hate this
I can remember the spoony (and Linkara) cameos, but I can't remember the movie itself
8he tries too hard
whos actually seen the full BE movie?
I have.
I've seen... most of it
couldn't finish
wasn't nearly drunk enough to sit through two hours of Travolta being... travolting
milk money review was awesome
I think they over did it. They need it to go slower.
the only travolta movie I've ever seen is pulp fiction
07weeeeird
travolta's one of those weird actors
Not Swordfish?
he has good movies
like PF
Pulp fiction is a great movie.
Welp, I guess I'll go watch that review now, then
and Face/Off
Gonna grab myself some soda while on it
and then he's got Hairspray
and BE
4Ah, good
14Yeah
14sure is
Travolta's movies are great every time he's not in charge of actually making it
dunno
does the movie night/day start in 2 hours?
I think Cage takes only the best and worst movies he's offered
his best are okay
Nick Cage is awesome. I guess the BMN acknowledges that?
12i can't think
8yes, mare
first National TReasure
121600x1200
and then he has the Wicker Man
12what's the blasted ratio x-x

someone dubbed the dialogue over
have we already seen the room?
Ho'd get burned?
Yes.
Yep.
I'm still wondering if I should choose a western movie again if I get chosen for a movie
6I like the decimal when you divide 1 by 243 or 81.
hah
Someone did with the scene where Twilight finds the book Spike burned in Owls Well that Ends Well
Pick one of the Bud Spencer/ Terence Hill westerns, hee.
and they shopped Cage's face onto her
03@calc 1/243
= 0.004115
Oh yes they did.
i wanna see snakes on a train
03o.o
Elky, we watched Fist Full of Dollars, Westerns are appreciated.
03@calc 1/81
Not interesting at all
= 0.012346
6It has to be longer.
oh, what's the one western
6It has to be much longer.
apon, I picked a fistful of dollars
Heya guys
Fullstops make sentences longer.
uh
FLUTE!
03hm

Hrm
030.01234567901234567901234567901235
You did? Awesome!
03they missed the 8
Djiango would probably a bit too off the scale for folks.
6Indeed.
4Yeah, Elky picked a good film
lol I realized that
man, though, last week
Deathstalker
that was special
030.00411522633744855967078189300412
03that one I don't get at all
Deathstalker was the best thing ever to happen to BAD
6The pattern.
err.
BMN
oh
lol
We need a Reb Brown movie.
YES! Reb Brown would be awesome!
wtf are they doing on mythbusters?
I'd suggest Manos, but without the MST3K guys that'd be unbearable
Dropping cars
@calc 1/1
= 1
but why?
Because they can.
/me has seen twelve monkeys at least twelve times.
Man.
:(
Too many 1s
:p
It always displays 1 ;.;
Like even with 5/

>Mythbusters

Everywhere
I approve

/me derp
lol
is that the really weird heath ledger movie?
The 1942 Munchhausen?
WOuld be neat
4I know
no, the imaginarium
4How about a Uwe Boll film?
ugh
look at all that coke
ugh
or my favorite, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
03...
they're supposed to be BAD, not unwatchable
don't even suggest that
035/5 IS 1 though
I know
Why can't it be something other than 1
Spider's Web was at least fun
1 is getting boring
:p
uwe boll
7no it was not
de 'greatest fucking genius in de whole fucking beezness'
no
no spiders web
03then do sometihng else
03@calc 1+1
03:P

wow, you could see the air compressing
Amazing
Spiders Web WAS fun, if you're a masochist.
Spiders Web was someone torlling this channel :(
DRF is my hero
/me goes back to GC
I'm a masochist and that was NOT fun.
03LOL
You know
8the pig?
Yes.
"It's just like the crater Jamie made when he came to earth."
8i do
the deal with it pig lol
That's all pig
BUSTED
awww
He chose Spider's Web.
He sugessted the pig movie
Ohohohoho.
8he made us watch the worst movie ever
lo
6Spider's Web doesn't exist.
lol, he trolled us
they should try this Mythbusting with trains
which is, like the worst movie ever
lol
Mockbusters
wats spiders web about?
03It's probably been done
we should watch Transmorphers
about a pig
Never seen it. Maybe I should be glad I wasn't here.
It makes Uwe Boll look like Oscar-winning genius
7spiders, pigs and snakes
4If I get A movie
8http://i.imgur.com/neWcB.gif
oooooor, for bad-movie awfulness
It's an even MORE painfully boring version of Charlotte's Web.
The only good thing about the PS3 is the hardware
Ratatoing
Well
whats the B- movie tonight?
Old hardware
03it *was* the good thing
I didn't have to see the pig film.
4Battlefield Earth, HaxBrony
I was on holiday having fun.
03>_>
Yeah z.z
/me 8slaps dari
*earth
Heheheh.
03which is precisely why I only use my PS3 to play movies.
*Is jealous of Prince-Dari*
4Not telling, Elky :P
Since I never heard about it before that point
it's much less painful watching it with others
03that and upscaling DVDs.
It is?
hm...
oh, there was this one movie
that one was amazing
If I get picked for either movie we're watching some fucking Godzilla, the GOOD Godzilla, not the shitty American knockoff.
I have to say ONE good thi9ng about Spider's Web.
It didn't depict the spiders as the bad guys.
I refuse to use HDMI for any HD product
I hope we get drunk cooking
/me likes spiders
also, the pig's rap was pretty fun
hahaha
can we watch gordy
I'm laughing at the stupidity of Milk Money, now that I'm watching the NC review
No, but we NEED to
Silly Rezo....
"Say, I'm really wired...."
6ARTI.

Lawl
heh
7hehe
NAAAAAAAAAAAAATUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURE!
pwn'd
olololol
Wiintosh
:D
Not going to happen
damn my 90wpm
Welp, let's laugh at it together, now
never seen this. -.-
?
LOL
dat add!
ಠ_ಠ
AdBlock+ is best pony.
it'd run iOS 5
wow
charming
Nah
It'd run Android
they should have read the book
uh oh.
Then it'll be complete :D
12Actually, the OS that comes with the wii is already a lot like a mac
...
wtf
0.o
dafuqs this
Milk Money
Milk Money.
Milk Money.
lol these kids are clueless
looks like a boob?
It's this week's review
grade a dialogue there
ED HARRIS!?
sex ed... in elementary school?
Shouldn't we watch this instead of Battlefield Earth? \(:D)/
lol.
This does creep me out.
no
because of its large icons
this movie is veering straight into wtfery
03it would suck
03:P
dayum
Most schools in the UK start sex ed in last year of elementry school. Dunno about the US
Well
See
There are many issues
As...the tablet is just a screen
iOS
wasup
yes it can
The Wii U *might*
lol full house
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
forgive me for using these foul device names, drf
Best abbreviation ever
Always hated Full House.
all the tiiiime
Equestria
Whee
but the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch all are just screens with a few buttons
they dont' wear clothes
Terrible 80s and 90s comedy references :(
03try ONE button
LOL
kill the pig.
Volume buttons don't count
flk;ajdfk;sdj
Sadly :p
hot
12It only needs one button though :p
this is the charming, heartwarming coming of age story
and, on iPad and iPhone, silence/lock rotation button
No gurl ever paid to wear my jacket
The makers went forward in time and saw Spider's Web.
03lock SWITCH
03not button
yup
6MILK IT
?
adblocker you need it.
still, the others are buttons
03yeah but Android devices have a lot more button.
Do they do anything with the menus?
6DAT MASSIVE CHATLAG
03*buttons
not really
commendably dumb
/me did see his first porn flicks at twelve or thirteen. Did it in a much less awkward fashion than THIS, though
I like that turn of phrase
"Are you prostitute?" the best pick up line ever
LOL
03yes really.
the volume buttons control, well, volume
YOU GUYS NEED SOME HELP?
or, Android
my mistake
ARE YOU A PROSTITUTE?
Hello keyboards
06Gnite all
Night LU <
next movie
:<
only on weekends.
/me hugs
12Night
How the heck does that work?
those heels
....
this movie
06Gnite
why does this exist
03anyway bbl
Because Hollywood
needs money
Well, it's not Serbian Movie
If they really want a prostitute they should just give Paris Hilton a call, she's cheaper.
Serbian movie doesn't exist
12However, Android makes apple suck
03^
It's the pedo music
lol.
goodnight lu =D
This is terrible.
this
If they ever release it
And I remember seeing adds for this on TV
How delightful
this movie never needed to exist
>Cigarettes
watching George Clooney eat out a random italian woman in 'The American' was less awkward than this
I wanna know how they advertized this
This is very weird.... Glad I never seen this movie.
lol
Actually...
cause hookers borrow their pimps' cars all the time
... with pretty much the same scenes you see in this review
Well behaved, yeah, right
awkward hand shaking
we have to coordinate this
math tutor?
Did that kid get Ed Harris a prostitute?
tgi fridays, gtfo
and do it after annuncements
6Which is why I'm bringing it up now.
"oh, you know each other"
DID THEY
LOL
ha
they just went there
HAHA
6It would be in color order, and dari would end it with his rainbow writing.
win
I know
wooooow
But I don't want Milk Money in Florida.
Those girls
We need all the mods here to start with though.
is that toy story music?
>Chick not changing her dress for a week
and... plys her trade

/me waves
Stop looking at her like that
that was bad *derpface*
Very, very, very bad
okay.jpg

=|
she spoke to meeee
well, we can change around the colors
I'm his aunt
6We can still do it if they're not here though.
"I can hear you, you twerp."
Awkward smile.jpg
he's seen my tits
I watch this with sound off and it's STILL terrible
Haha
OOOoooooOOOoo
that'd be interesting...
I'm pretty sure
best line ever
...

6It's just ugly brown.
Oral presentation
oral
I didn't know how the female reproductive cycle worked
close enough
12aOS
12XD

Neither did I by that age
i learned about that in elementary school
This movie I swear
:<
elementary school varies by country. Which grade?
......
>Headrest
this movie needs to burn
fourth grade iirc
Rezo-chan, you're asking me?
....*facepalm*
did he draw boobs on her
...
And yes
And lol, those girls
No
a letter for every OS
He drew ovaries on her
those girls are lesbos
Prostitots
wOS
Everyone is bi in this school, apparently.
Prostitots is now in my vocabulary.
gOS
although bOSs would be nice
Now we know our OSes
our sex ed in fifth grade was
6th & 7th for us.
'hormones suck'
yo bros, when the movies start
?
4th for us
'have fun in middle school'
It was vague
LOL
You know, I'm pretty sure most teachers have keys to their own classroom.
But it worked
In an hour and ten minutes, TVOTR
In a hour, TVOTE532
And lol
tvotr: 2 hours

Hipster_Brony: did someone say SPiderman thread

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC32j1TIJRg
Its a case of trollism similar to the removal of the episodes from YTube
6these espeons, they come in pairs
My face is text

Kill Applejack D:
A real man
6Dunno...

Welp, still not interested in social sites

where is harvey dent!?
I can only handle 2^32 espeons
suddenly, there is a whole floofpile of Espeons as large as Kansas
anyone heard the Pendulum song of the scary tunnel?
harvey dent is good at hide and go seek
I agree

SPAAACE
Man I listened to Limp Bizkit when I was in 1st grade :D
they came from....
Germany
06A sea of Espeons.
READ A BOK
someone needs to mod a pinkie sphere into P2
READ A BOOK
Okay, I'll read a book, sheesh
READ A MOTHERFUCKING BOOK
Oh yes
OH YES.
That's win.
Pinkie Panther
I'm glad poniator
12= A sea of Floof
who's spyro's voice in that one?
we have to play pinkiequest if we get posted before the show starts though
^
I would watch this.
6a sea of espeons, glorious
fail
O.O
wth
I... can see that working
I wish they could hold an OC contest.
Can you draw us a sea of espeons?
8Dee_Twenty: pinkie has had plenty of episodes
classy spike
6Yeah..I think I can wait for another 1,5 year..
8Dash needs more of them
6Oh, definitely.
haha
RIP
6Who's he?
too many episodes with no dash.
Spike needs his own spin off.
She feels caring <3
Dash needs more songs
6...
6I think I drew one before. Ovo
8 1 episode with no Dash is too many
6I think.
Out of the mane 6, Dash has the least screentime. Its been COUNTED>
6I need to draw all the falseons we've come up with in this channel
...
Oh yes
NAAAAAAAAAAATUUUUUUUUUUURE!
and back
Pinkie and Dash should do a duet song
My EARS
/me thingks there should be a ghosteon eveelution
Vapespeon
you eat pieces of shit for breakfast ololol
derma: literal screen time doesn't equal focus on a pony
or fighting type
oh this
hah
...
aww yeaaaaaaaah
EAT SHIT
6Y'know, it might've been a long time ago I made that sprite up.
Elky: I know.
8need a Dash solo song is S2
agreed.
Lawl
^^^
I wish people actually listened to things I said...
6o.o
Hipster_Brony: How about 2?
8well, yeah
6I think Veyka counts enough as an Espeon/Umbreon mix.
heheeh i demand tp for my bunghole
xD
6I think I'll take that for an SCS just cause it's random.
8i would be fine if every episode had a Dash song
ok
I doubt the allcaps things works either D:
06Flarjoltporeon.
Meh.
Asleigh ball signing ponies
and me, well i BLAHHHH!
Dash is meh.
did anyone see fairly odd movie?
06And yes, he does.
that was amazing
the gokaiger version, right?
that pie take cracks me up everytime
DAT B-BIT
Come on, OC contest... anybody?
6Yeah.
REZO
LOL oc
NO
6Nope..
I saw a bit of it
>Implying I have talent
06Twice the fun, in another way
6Might actually play Pinkie Quest then instead.
Would it be that bad?
Dash is epic. rezo ಠ_ಠ
lol
why do people hat OCs?
anyone singing along?
if there was a fighting type eveelution it should be called
hate?
Puncheon
Yeah, what's wrong with OCs?
I don't hate OC
Rainbow Pony is least best pony.
/me is tomato'd in the face
aw, dammit. i missed Anthologies?
DEE
Dash is a bogstandard female jock character the likes of which have been dime a dozen for the past two decades. Sorry.
http://i.imgur.com/8kx2B.jpg
and furries
NEIN
6 701 MB
Eh, I prefer canon characters than OCs
because my fingers are for strictly gaming
Rainbow Pony is always best pony.
Nothing wrong with OCs, people just hate Mary Sues/Gary Stues.
6I don't care about it really..
/me pokes
it was good
Just give them flaws.
4DCD gives his regards
just like the cartoon
Okay
And they won't be Mary Sues.
Meh
My pony is weak to color yellow
Is FO:E an example of well-made OCs?
When I made my RP character, I took my persona
yes
it is
ok
didn't care much about the cartoon
best pony is the one with a perfectly coifed mane
and ripped one of his arms off
Eee-up, Derma
/me does not feel bad for thinking that Rarity pony is the bestest pony of all time.
did he say anything else
That counts as a flaw, right?
?
Too many OCS that act all innocent and unworthy in pony fanfics is my problem with them
lol wat
still can't believe Tara Strong voices Timmy
>Ripped arm off
Yeah
I just realized
He's one-armed
I know all the lyrics to Winter Wrap Up
Bwahahahaha
like a boss
like a bawss
Oh, and wings.
She's like HTC phones: quietly brilliant
Why did I read that as visible rectum? XD
...
I've always wanted wings
Wow.
rofl
she voices dil
we need OC because they are not enough male characters in the show
VISIBLE PLOT
You look freaking majestic with wings
And my OC is male.
ow
You're welcome. :p
Don't scare me, fluttershy
(oh and if it isn't clear my character's humanoid)
/me is okay with lotsa girl ponies.
nothing we can really do now
Dat music
I agree with Rezo
i'm watching the hangover
brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
i kinda like the mojarity being female
i dont mind all the plot in S1
Title: Naruto derp song I bet
in retrospect, i should have given him a heads up yesterday that we were starting earlier
Hmm, intriguing.
mate with a whole bunch of females.
dari: is that bjornfot's request?
I like the idea of Equestria being a matriarchal society
Elky: No.
6I don't think I've even heard of it..
Adds to the depth of the world
6D:
6Probably, but... *shrug*
I don't think Equestria's Matriarchal
Elky: You'll know when you see Bjornfot's request.
There is something fundamentally wrong with equestria (I dont know how to do Links)
i wanna see harry potter 7 part 2
Grass
aw, damn, my ears
A hill
Maybe
ow
8dammit, we arent actually showing that, are we, dari?
/me thinks of it as a show that's focussing on a group of girls, and their antics. Other demographics are consequently peripheral.
^love that one
6EEEEEEEEEEnope.
Lawl.
Celestia's not even a pony, she's an avatar of the sun.
haha

Oh please baby geniuses...thats bad even for us...

Well that's a bit shallow don't you think?
I can't imagine something worse than spider's web
rarity is BEST PONY
ONE DAY WE NEED TO WATCH SPIDERS WEB AGAIN JUST CAUSE
Fuck yes

JUST NO.
Rarity is fine
rarity wins everything
6Hooray for Dari having CoD4!
Why do ponies make even the shittiest songs tolerable?
6Aah.. D:

CoD 4 campaign was awesome.
6Bai..
Cya.
byez

Rairity knows how to handle herself in public unlike most women
then rarity sang it
suddenly it was cool
buts reg'd by me ;pp
/me 3is beaten with wand of Gamelon
DSN exactly!
ponies can even make Katy Perry sound good
6The maps in multiplayer are quite good too..
Pretty much
Rarity does that to everything she touches.
Ponies make everything 20% cooler
ponies make 99% of terrible songs good
Nuu its fine
8DSNesmith: nope.avi
you can use it XD

Fluttershy would win

Oh we're about to start?
I agree with dari, it was awesome
8the fact that it wasnt katy perry helped
xD
4OH
Derm: why?
4Guys
The humor was really toned down in dotm, the plothole were lessend, the characters, no matter how minor served some kind of purpose

8its ok
To be honest I think he was putting it on a lot.
8i liked the iphone commercial more
Not gonna argue there, but I like how they were in the book
Blaaarg!

Hipster_Brony: iphone commercial was awesome
12SORRY

Trinkie?

4We need the order
6Yeah, that.
@amerelurker yes?
Eh. I still have Optimus Prime as my background.

0that's how long the Godfather is
Rainbow dash is EVEL
Ok.
no, crack pairing would be
>:3
ok
Depends on how well it's written
how would that work?
Lunabby?
coffee: not likely, it doesn't seem like a probable ship
they can make magic with parties!
Trinkie, doesn't sound believeable, but if you make it work...
stop for a sec
Luna+Socks=Rainbow Dash-Pinkie Pie>Trollestia
in this order:
Appleflour
Twilight + Pinkie Pie: Twinkies?
LunaxSnails is best ship anyway
