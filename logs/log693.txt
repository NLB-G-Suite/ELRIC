Aww Yeah chaisse lounge
Yeah, I like norwegian TV, but if I lived alone, I probably would not have a TV
*here
Hehe, I don't really use consoles either, so- I wouldn't need one

:D
and hio everyone :)

i thikn he's just playing it for the theme music
I played technic pack for the horses-
Hehehe, the bow was waesome back then

i wish the technic pack had the millenaire mod
I play the oudated one
that's the only reason i'm still using yogbox
Technic 0.6.7, with millenaire and mo-creatures
aw yeah
This again? :D
<,< yeah, you had to hide in a cave for 5 minutes
The only Mod I reaslly used was tzhe shader Mod, but it doesn't work since the full release :(
*with
/me whistles
i just realized how aggressive it really was
I hear that's back in 1.3 hardmode, though
It was scary and awesome
one little slip up with a fireplace, and there goes hours of house work
Terrifying... But AWESOME /)^3^(\
And since, during that period at least, leafs didn't decay, we used it to clean up after foresting
dude yes
aww yeah
Hehehe
yeaah
I startedp laying shortly after halloween update I think
it had the biggest cave i had ever found, weeks exploring it and i still wasn't finished

I think..yes
We had a town, where we constructed a huge wall around and lit up all the insides, to be safe from mods
no mods- just mining and building- and we lost interest when we updated worldsave, because- we lost all our work
ouch
DEMAAAA
Moojayyyyyy!
Howsit?
Tis good
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697813 the great wall we had before updating worldsave
Hehe
05"You are as dense as depleted uranium"
05gotta remember that one
05i spotify it
how do you viking music?
do i even want to know...
Spotify > piracy
Free music > spotify
we have no torrents in germany
feels bad man
I ddon't think Spotify has the music I want ^^"
It has most of the things I like
but I mainly listen to--hipster crap I guess
05torrents arent illegal
05torrents with illegal data are illegal
ok the only one i have ever listened to is noise haha
(\
Noo don't go
;~;
they might be able to repeat things they've seen that are copywrite
05as for me
it's basically stems from artists not moving on stage, just standing there glaring at their pedals
whistle*
05spotify provides all the music i want
05new albums of my favorite artists etc
Pretty much same here
05or pony music
05otehr than that spotify sates my needs
I kinda like Venetian Snares and Aphex
At the moment I'm addicted to Animal Collective, woo
idk if germany even has spotify here
He needs money to eaat
yeah, well half
11,02So close ;~;
05spotify exists more or less everywhere
Yeah, it's more or less international at this point
well i have no use for it
i'll just stick to "album name rar download"
05they got my vote
Piracy. Yarr.
arrrrg
05<3
Yeah, and it supports a lot of indie artists and obscure artists as well
05while downloading a rar does neitehr
i like buying music from artists that own their own labels like patton or devin townsend
good lord devin townsend <3
Devin is cool, haven't listened to a lot
soooo awesome
I liked hummer
was that the name?
haha yeah
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
my favorite album by him is deconstruction
Very talented and inspirational dude, though
oh for sure, i use devin townsend to get non metal fans into metal lmao
Mfw I realised I have torrented anything in months and have been fine listening to "free" artists and pony music .-.
I haven't*
I haven't downloaded music for years- I have downloaded thigns like VK Demos, that I just can
t find anymore
05folkmetal and powermetal ftw
05IN MY SWORD I TRUST
i know only a little folk and power metal
folkmetal? O_o
I'm sniffing coke.
Never really returned-
like immortal
05Gold_Demona: ill make sure to play some folkmetal ocne i stream again :P
/me steals TheRandomkid321's coke .-.
Yeah, most I've met are..nice people
Wkre: kk :3
Wrek*
Derpdetype
Coke dehydrates you man :<
Yeah, seen that song
Afri Cola...
loooove that song
admins youre dumb
we should Stream the 60's Afri Cola Commercial here xD
i don't like soda that much anymore
i have none in my fridge, just milk
I know dear
I really don't like Songs with Lyrics, it's always ether the Voice, the Text, or the way it doesn't fit with the rest that annoys me
but the few actual Songs I like are extremly high up on my Favourits List :)
I prefer lyrics, but I really like instrumentals too
whichever it was i read it years ago
I doo, as far as I know
I'm bad at genre names
(\ aww yeaah
Still about 9ß% of my Music is from Games, and generally everything cann be there, Hip Hop, Rap, Metal, Ragtime, Jazz Orchestral, Chiptune... It's just everything xD
I think the--metalliest thing I've seen live is probably Like rats from a sinking ship, or parts of monolithic
Like rats is- fun live, they threw a moog synth and a nord synth in a pile of glass and beer
I--hope it didn't break
Nice

He'll be pretty strict in needed times, though.
i dont know why i watch the news its all doom and gloom
TF2 crashed, then?
ouch that sucks
XD
I've tried it, and frankly, it's a bit buggy.
I found a server which gives Porygon2 and it's possible to evolve it to Porygon-Z inside the Global Terminal

...
...
Ate and poowerfool twizzly.... hiya
hey
Righto
/me rolls around
Oh that one
can't wait for that
I can. I don't have a device that can play it. :<
I have several. ;_;
I have neither Android or iOS
Naw.
Poor Dema
My phone is a RAZR
HOHOHOHOHOHO
The OLD one that's not a smartphone
RAZR
wow those things
but it flips!
flip phones are bad-ass.
iphone does not flip
And my phone sits nicely on my phone-holder that looks like a couch. :P
why would you ever want to upgrade then?
I don't. It just makes me sad when things like this come out and I can't play them. :<
I've had it for years
Eh
LOL
Can get an Android phone for cheapest of $50 here
Yeah, you can get them pretty cheap here too, but the trick is adding the smartphone data service to my phone plan
Right now I have talk and text on my plan. Data is extra.
Huzzah
Huzzah?
O.o
>.>
I dunno
I use Wifi, but all the phoneservices automatically include minimum data plan
in this country that is- as far as I know
I'm stuck trying to come up with names for my characters in TOR. >.>
<.<
I keep getting booted from server cuz I'm idle too long trying to think of a name
My lord Dema >.<
lol
It's a name D:
Yeah, but names are hard. :<
I want to make good names...
Silly silly silly dema.
I suck at making good names...
I only know how to make silly names...
yet, you spend 20 minutes -
:<
Hehehe
lol
Woop
TOR - The old republic.
Aah
Same as most MMOs. They're not usernames, but character names.
I haven't watched enough star wars to know any naming patterns-
but it's always fun to get a name that sounds..like it belongs
Yeah
No obscenities
Yeah, Pok?mon names are a lot easier. Anything goes.
Hehe
heh
:O
Why not?
/me shrugs
World peace.
It's just like any other rpg
I think it's just not my style of fighting in games-
I tend to stick to wrpg style
wrpg?
or crpg, whichever name is right
Hehehe
or burn down a city in Dishonored
Nuh huh!
Torture is baad
crpg? O_o
<,<..that was an accident
Uh-huh
UH-HUH
noot--actions per se
Oh
LOL.
dat kick
not action, but DnD'y
stratagy
I prefer BOATLOADS of dialog and walking over much combat, I guess
?
NUFF SAID
I like Dungeon Crawlers too
d
LOL Stadium doesn't count
you mean the worst one
dungeon crawlers are fun too, like nethack or..dungeon master(name?)- legends of grimrock
it's THE worst?
I liked Etrian Odyssey
Oi
It ain't the worst
<m< I need to download a emulator
Nonono the REAL Pok?mon games have actual story to them
ok the camera one is the worst
Goodgood, because story is the best reason to play
Not a lot of story, mind you, but enough to keep it interesting
Oi
You arse.
oh cmon, really?
AHAHA
Dema got it.
5th Gen is QUITE story intensive
It's like fighting PETA :D
LOL yup XD
Hehe
Well, then I might pick that one up
I'm not very familiar with pokemons, but yeah- I enjoy their visaage
POKEMANS.
sequal
aah
platform is it for?
DS
/me snaps fingers
Yup DS
but--buying a ds <,< not sure-
Oh, you don't have a DS...
yarhar
Um...
That complicates matters cuz all the actual pok?mon games are on Gameboy or DS
^
Pfffft
Mufffin
Aah
I think that's the same for the other games too
I actually didn't have any handheld games until the first Pok?mon came out.
same
dat ? >.>
I've yet to own anything handheld, for games specifically
YOU'RE ALL CRUEL
Hehe
I got an NES when I was like 4 or 5
dDuck Hunt!
I used to play that at my uncles house
was always fascinated by how the gun worked
i still got my old nes
And mind you, I hated fighting games back then
I always liked fighting games, but I've never been any good at them. :P
Yp
yo* darnit
are*
I like most kinds of games
not really good at any games, but- still fun
I'm not overly picky
^
goodnight everypony :P take it easy
The only games I dislike are racing and sports videogames
Yeah, I don't like sports games. Controls are too weird for me
Sif avoid FF games
</3
I can see why people like theem but yeah
not for me- sadly
Oh that hurts
8 was boring.
FF Movies are the bomb ;~;
12 was the last one I played and it was boring
I might only have played 7 or 8 and 11
Nu-uh
11's the MMO
okay not 11 then-
That was 10-2
^
I like 10-2. It's fun in its own way
like --17 I think
16-
something like that
wowza o.o
Then I played 7 for the first time when I was 16
I didn't play 8 till much much later, but it was there
The stories ceased to be well-written
lol
or at least consistent quality
Sephiroth's good as a villain, but he's WAY overrated.
^
Hehe, he's ERRYWHER
But yeah she was totally into him at the time-
There has yet to be a villain more villainous than Kefka from 6
That mofo was NUTS
!
I like nuts.
I'm suure you do
That didn't come out right.
At all.
Yeah, 6 was awesome
version*
FF7
Psshtt
Hehe
Doesn't hurt
Plus there's achievements
Achieeveements D:
/me has both
The only way I'd buy FF7 again is if they update the graphics to today's standard.
wow
Get it on it fandom!
You did it to morrowind, you could do it again
Huh it's on special too
heh
it's..bizarre
lol Achievements. Wow, that's SUCH a selling point. XD
:<
/me likes achievements
I like achievements to, but that's not a selling point for me. :P
too*
http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/forum/upload/Inny/Inny_1318587984_41808_1296411867.jpg

/me is just saying
Oh baby.
Ohmai!
Hehe
ahahaha

You're too attached veeveex.

Also the fact that characters die permanently was a huge turnoff for me
Permadeaath
Ponies
ahh
LIES.
thought u were talking about xcoim :(
lolxcom
xcom*
xcom?
XCOM was fun
the only thing that confuses me is that I saw a repot on the upcoming one long ago thatl ooked amazing, yet the one that came out looks ..meh
I see
heh
Hehe, it was pretty fun, but- hard
Hehehe
Oh
igeddit

the ds one? or one for a console?
Neither ;_;
Woop
LOL yup
AHAHAHA
hehehe
haha lsl....
I recognized it immediately. :D
:(
dem trouts get a workout it seems on this site
wrong
With wut :o
Did you try the recent remakes of the first three games?
osnap
Whatever shall you do D:
Not a trout it seems-
And you're asking me for things to draw?
All I'm gonna scream at you is DERPY.
Or draw a house
A lot of old games were totally unforgiving
Yup
Derpy with the TARDIS :>
is KingsQuest a dungeon crawler?
*googlsz
ew
Oooh~~
Point and click adventure
If I was in a comical mood, those would suffice.
D:
Ooh, I kinda like that too. Like muds or..
Zork.
LOL Wasn't Zork ALL text though. XD
?
Yep
Yup
Zork was all text yeah, 1972 MIT?
Zork4lyf
muds were fun, all text rpg with nerds
I've never even seen it in action, I only know about it by reputation
Oh boy
You've missed out :P
muds eh were the precursor to MMOs
I was born in 84. Too young for text RPGs. :P
The Godfather of RPG
whats a MIT?
whats a MUDS?
in fact, I sitll play text adventures
MIT is Massachussets institute of technology
I was born in 1984
/me cant follow the convo
MUD is .. an engine for text adventure games for multiplep layers, basicly multiplayer rpg
It's--actually REALLY fun if you get into it
HAYO
Huzzah for hugs
hugs everrywhur
for some reason, I picture SB's computer back ground to be something like this http://bibi-6f4pn.deviantart.com/art/moo-332530961
rofl
Hehe
Despite having not played the KingsQuest series, I do like point and clink games. :3
Most of them have a goofy sense of humor which I really enjoy. XD
Oi, I know... something attractive.
hm?
o.O
Flag that tail!
O_o
eh
Thought you meant in a different context, nevermind~
Continue drawwing

ROFL
We need a pony mud!
We fucking need a pony mud!
/me passes out in realization
I agree
Soapo
Why has this not happened yet?
Muds aren't even hard to make! You just need good writers and..a lot of room makers
I can write things!
egghh
but oh a social--mud with adventures- why not
You haven't lived until you've died in MUD
Hehe

Demaa D:
My power supply blinked. :<
:<
It decided "No, I can't!" and turned both my computers off
Bad power supply.
Aww-
If it's randomly blinking off for no reason
Oh, no it's not my computer power supply. Um... It's like a power strip but it's a battery?
Oh
I was right
Ooh
Hehe
How about that. Ahaha
Never had one of those-
lol yeah
I want one damn it, but they're abit hefty for decent ones.
Mine's been pretty good. Had it for a few years
Or none of those things?
I need to get a battery back up
=\
I think the battery in mine crapped out because it no longer keeps my computers on when the power blinks.
Time to replace Dema
Yup
I mean the UPS, not Dema.
Whats a Dema/

Scaring people, psshtt.

Because they have powers
And are considered terrorists
And do they have any evidence of said terrorism?
Why would they need it?
They oppose the current government
And are therefore terrorists

He can't

They'd all be after him
he looks like neo
That's gonna be fun.
YATTA!
Hey hold up if Sylar in the future now has access to Hiro's future corpse...
Whats with the comic?
but maybe the future never happened
The comic is basically part of his foretelling.
agh time travel, it never makes any sense
HIYA everypony
We're nearing the end, oh boy.
yes
But....
Is that a european thing? Where you call it "series" instead of "seasons"?
i have time for 1 more thankfully
Do we?
Cuz there are 23 episodes in the first season of Heroes
Okay.
Nowhere :<
Aww :<
I am disappoint
But the UK English is to say 'series'
I getcha
You mean the correct English.
/me sings "THE MORE YOU KNOW!!~~~
Hah
I speak wrong English. :P
there is no right or wrong english.
Well, there is.
05i speak gibberish

And now Sylar knows the future too.
I was going to wait for the right time to share this one, but is it too good to wait for it. http://i.imgur.com/chnxJ.gif
You know, if you hadn't killed him Sylar I'm sure he would tell you.
Sylar is a monumental moron.
lol
In other news, I can not watch Football, I have to play it
*abusing
Wait, nvm.
Thanks.
theres 3 of her now :P
Oh yeah, this is all coming back to me now...
Pft. Sisters.
Yep.
Well if no one has noticed by now, they're not likely too.
i only saw some pics on a monitor
Can't tell you
Spoilers.
Damnit.
i thought it looked like the transforming girl
Heroes
Whoa it's Spock!
He was Sylar before he was Spock :D
why didnt htey kill him
Also why is Spock wearing a helmet?
Spock.
he shouldve just killed him
although i guess if he turns out immortal that coul screw them up
i forget if hes already immortal
oh wait nvm
He's...I'm not sure, he can regenerate to a degree but he can't be invulnerable yet.
yes he isnt invulnerable yet because he only got claire in the future
oooooh...she's the tracker.
'click'
Dat realization
The Walker System.
Sylar has a mum?
She's not all there is she.

I'm off stream after this ep
i tried playing Ps2, couldn't even get 10 fps on lowest settings

Vids back dari, you can keep playing.

Hum...
Welp
Nice going.
Should have stepped in earlier
well shes ded
Decapitation?
Oh dear.
tough day for sylar
When he uses his powers?
Well if he wasn't totally gone in the head beforehand he definitely is now.
Ouch
Thanks.
Well, maybe not hated him
But he was cold.
That's real nice.
WOw. Clean break
a gun!
Hai Guys!
Hayo
How are people this evening
Pretty good.
i left work 2 hours ago
oh good, heros
These people have way too many hang-ups about stopping the huge explosion.
Evil bitch
Wants the huge explosion to happen
I don' wanna kill Sylar it's against Bushido.
What's her power? I don't remember if they ever showed it
She dreams the future
shits getting messy
..that came out wrong
I DO BELIEVE!
Lawl
this show is full of moms of the year
Is that seriously all they want?
He drew a picture in her blood.
dude thats creepy
>implying he wasn't alread
already*
I hope that's not all because that is terribly unbelievable motivation.
why not, they could control the country
the cheerleader character is the most pointless to me in this show
They have enough power and connections to do that through bribery anyway.
I think they might be anticipating an apocalypse of sorts due to people with powers
Or something like that
I don't really remember.
dont think bribery would help that much, they dont seem to be excessively rich
Oh this was a good idea.
their security sucks
wow gg
Oh shit, he's heating up
And then everypony came.
NEXT
CLIFFANGET

wut..?
Nothing~
Power laptops exist, but it's cheaper to buy a stationary, in the long run at least
Bollocks, you are planning.
Needs nerf
pronto
That would of been a nasty price tag
need more power
11,02Price tag for it was $1200
SSD?
I've got i7 2600 670GTX 16gb ram on around..1200 dollars spread out over one and a half year
11,02HDD
11,021 TB though :D
6/8GB RAM?
11,028 GB
1tb here too
11,0215.4" 1080p
Oh gosh i suck at drawing on the computer..
egh 15.4"
Would drive me nuts
11,02Lenovo
11,02IdeaPad
That ain't bad for that price tag
Lenovo... Chinese, I think.
11,02ikr
China = good now adays
depending on the tier
11,02Plus it has a Blu-Ray Burner and Reader :3
^
11,02I don't like desktop computer really...
y? :<
11,02computers*
They're fun to play with.
I prefer them since I don't have to upgrade very often
I upgrade about once every 5 years or somethiing
11,02They're fun to build, but I'd rather have peace of mind by buying a computer built together already.
I really need to upgrade my harddrive. :D
Slacker >.>
11,02:<
I like having things not prebuilt, since if something breaks I can replace it on my own for less money
Would you have more piece of mind by building it yourself and knowing how it's been set up?
11,02Indeed, but after spending $1000+ on one and then getting issues, having to troubleshoot where the problem lies and then having to possibly replace a specific part isn't much fun.
Pfft
That is fun, whatchu on abuot.
about*
whoah wtf
Hehe
5 missed calls on skype?
people really wanted to talk to me on the 5th
/me plans on building a computer in the next one to three years
Pushh
http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/289/9/4/oc__by_cretorf-d5i0350.png
Says that you missed calls from users even though they never done them
Consoles are too--old
^
Just
That lowered my IQ reading that ;_;
Did he actually just say consoles... nah, I'm just hallucinating. XD
<_<
It's not that- I just don't like gamepads
11,02You need gamepads for certain games.
^
Yeah, but the only one in mylibrary is GTASA
and I don't play that anymore
11,02Super Meat Boy is one of them >>
how i feel today

PC's *can* fit controllers, you know?
Even joysticks, if they're used nowadays.
Egh
hello
modular, workstation, with games on the side
I've always used consoles, but I'm waning towards PCs now
11,02Joomay: For certain things, not always.
Psht
whats the server name?
Frat boys.
Not gonna stab you, just curious.
I'm netural for both.
Aah
Pen and paper
easy to acquire
Still, I'd like to see things that console are more superior in.
just look at ecmajor *fanboygasm*
wat
The controls, easily ported to computer.
Gaming industry?
Still, able to be done.
Another thing is that we can't say best games in the industry, when the diversity is subjective
11,02Probably the one thing I hate about PCs is certain games don't include matchmaking online. They just give you a list of servers to select from with their own special rules and not all of them have players in it.
:O
11,02DashWithRainbows: I don't care...?
Good boy :3
eewwwww
Only cause that's how the developers made it.
I prefer browser list over matchmaking, but that's again just a preference-
Positive emotions
yuck
And how they see it fit the platform
Eh
11,02Yes
11,02Yes
I prefer specific- lets me just--have one place to relate to
the dedicated server match thing in Valve games are kinda nice, no need to set up listenserver
^^^
You can find 'vanilla' servers that are hosted using a dedicated server.
^
The answer would apparently be to...read the server rules before joining it?
^
11,02Meanwhile: Sometimes they aren't clear until you join and get kicked.
Sue me dabi.
<.<
Not really an arguement
Just discussion.
Just curious.
/me is lost
You kinda get that one server you like
and always go to-
Ive been using alot of guides on paper, should i do the same with comp?
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D-VxzMw4kv0/TeX7AX3TE2I/AAAAAAAAFTA/rHu8S-G-bf8/s1600/130255146209.png
guides?
try studies instead
watch a characters movements and get familiar with how they're constructed
Not much contest there.
dabi pls
*streaming
Live commentary?
Yep.
cool
BNY?
Yep.
Is it limited to 3 letters?
yea that
Hm
05yeah

There's a bad point about the Wiimote that it uses batteries to play...I hated that.
Don't be silly, trade isn't for trading.
^
Trade is for when you've levelled past barrens.
Hopefully the Wii U Gamepad won't resolve the same battery issue.
Yo keep it PG breh.
There are some good people in there
Come back to WoW, they've got pandas.

08,01i'll make some python curry
24 inch pythons.
the hozen are fucking annoying
Do you even lift?
Haven't had curry in a LONG time.
Saturn: with or without poison?
Ew Curry
I don't think I've ever had curry before
Eever?
How do you manage to never have curry?
dunno, never seems to come up
Curry pie.
lel
^
A npc in pandaria is Lun-chi, a blatant reference if I ever saw one
I wouldn't say that it's just like...living in the western hemisphere and never having a chinese takeout.
Na, terrible idea.
I mean has anyone here never had a chinese takeaway?
her title is ,the street fighter.
isn't curry an indian dish?
>_>
R u srs dken
Wasn't relating the two.
Curry is a dish, but also a spice
A quest i found was called, Bros befor hozen
well spice mix I think?
Currymuncha. Wee
It is spice mix
ChimmiCurryChungaCherri
I found a page that was interesting
Chinese curry? wut.
How does that work
Never had chinese curry-
it had a bunch of numbers, turns out its a reference to D3's release date
Geeeeeek
I do like some npcs progressivly get annoyed the more you click them

Ahaha
People just questioning why theres random singing
The best part in that movie was the mosquitos
That bit made no sense at all.
Eeexactly
He can talk to mosquitoes...because.

That film was... interesting?
Yo you best watch yoself on this turf or I'mma give you hepatitis.
That film was the bomb.
That film was really weird when you get down to it.

The first volume is the walktrough
Dundee?
Apparently Hyneas aren't canines
Saturn: Oh, you bastard. XD
Did they all just look at you..like.."?"
we should organize some Gangam flashmobs all around the world
Tours of Dundee, on the left you'll see Dundee town hall, on the right you'll see a woman being burnt at the stake.
Saturn: sure
Saturn: my little brother loves that song
08,01okay, let's all go to Eli's house

why would you adblock porn? seriously guys.
Cuz its bad porn :(

It's as simple as that.

Has PETA ever done anything good for the rest of the world, besides look like a bunch of assholes?
oopa

PeTA has probably harmed more animals than they sved, only good is probably Vivisection awareness
Go PETA.

I don't beaat ponies..I..something
Peta harms animals?
05most lately up here

I want a Team PETA shirt.
Idiots

Pfft.
PETA=exact embodiement of dumbass
SRSLY
Didnt they dump buckets of blood on people at one point?
/me doesn't ask anymore
Leave it at that.
:3
it's not wrong to protect animals! PETA just does it wrong
11,02PETA: The organization that loves every species other than their own.
They also use nuidty and celebrities to promote their cause, which in turn kinda hurts it
PETA
PETA can't even look after other animals right, forget their own.
loving species
The people for extorsion, terrorism and arson.
Why would someon stop buying fur because naked woman?
that's a lie and you know it
yeah- do local work, help out
'take care' of the animals
I can sympathise with hating people, people by and large are terrible, but PETA has this incredible ability to not see the results of their actions.
i want stream ><
:<
they see the results
they just dont care
I want world peace.
See me getting it?
05best way to die
loljks
the method we slaughter animals wiht now is probably the most humane when done by a good company, bad companies get shit rep anyway
Surely the pro-tip would be don't get caught.
Don't let him near animals
Or...you know, just not commit crimes.
your*
Peta's games are utter bullshit
PETA games are GOTY.
11,02I don't see PETA protecting all the other animals in wildlife from killing each other nor converting lions into vegans.
dang it, are we talking about peta now?
Yeah, some things just have to happen
05being omnivores
05we arent supposed to be vegan
and that does not meen stop providing meat to meat eating us
05heck vegitarian is pushign it
Does peta actualy do anything to the animals they "save"?
PETA= DUMBFUCKS
meat to meat
they kill them
literally
How is that saving them
No idea
It's not.
because they aren't being abused
05anotehr thing
11,02Eli: Is it really? Animals eat other animals to survive, and they do it by their own means as well. Humans do the same thing.
SO...killing them is the next best option?
It's also how they have a biased uneducated opinion on animal psychology that makes them make bad decisions
Killing rats isn't cool.
05peta is agaisnt usign animals formedicinal research
05well fun fact, 3 of their chairman wouldnt be alive today without that research
WE ARE ANIMALS
I'm not.
05they are diabetic adn insulin comes from animal research

Without animal research medical practice would be years behind.

Fucking grass pulp, I don't know.
They don't, realistically.
05SpadeMagnes[School] not really
we need protein
and meat has a lot of protein
you live off*
bugs and other plant types can give us enoguh protein

A lot of nuts.
The only things we should stop in meat industry is cruel and painful upbringing or methods

boy, if only i could find that image about peta
fact: steak is delicious
11,02Eli: How is it pointless? We're discussing the opposing arguments against their actions with unbiased opinions.
05for isntance?
Animals are people too,no not really
Everyone is biased.
There is no such thing as an unbiased opinion.
Yeah, but as an organization, they could have done more research to base their manifest on
I like trains.
True-
05aye
hold on
just
11,01Hi.
allo Nitty!
05but one thing i want you to do
05watch the penn & tellers bullshit on peta
11,02Cutting open salmon farm nets isn't the effective and legal way of dealing with animal cruelty.
05and the evidence speaks for itself
Penn & Teller, put that on stream some time <3
Releasing minks from a minkfarm gives them hours fo pain and suffering
Hippies gone wrong.

LOL
I like some meat, but a lot of it I just odn't like the taste of
oh yeah, and peta is free to kill about every animal they find?
but there's one thing I can't eat, and that's DEER
After just reading Animal Farm, this is hilarious
I'm quite certain if PETA had their way, no one would be able to own "pets"
He has crazy eyes.

I like pigs' meat, but I like pigs as animals too :3

i have absolutely nothing against believers. but srsly... don't talk shit like that
need proof for evolution, and yet push for the bible to be taught as scientific fact

Wow, that metaphor.

It makes me sad that the later seasons have nudity and can't be streamed here.
You remember the outcry over Intelligent Design being taught in one state?

hah. ponies up

13Saturn: oh, selfish gene is on there, think i'll look into that
The atheists went to outright war against that because the Intelligent Design theory at least creates a shred of doubt in macroevolution and is therefore no different than forcing atheists to convert to Christianity at gunpoint.
how many % did he say?
And they won
40 :\
:D
THE IRS TOOK TELLER

POOR TELLER

i had a dream......
Theres already a insitution that spends all its time talking about intelligent design. Its called a church. Why does a school need to have time for that too?

Saturn: supply it for me AND get me 3 plushies
08,01Bronysith: how about i just buy you a maid outfit?
13not bad
Saturn: maid outfit, AND 3 plushies
08,01Bronysith: can they be any plushies?
It needs to be more than 'possibly true' you need actual evidence
and i get to pic em out
Teaching Macro Evolution is, in essence, compelling Christians to convert to Atheism.
BABBIES
Saturn: from bitterxtea plushies
13and then there's scientology~
And once everyone is the government no one is.

theres nothing we could do to 'fix it' beyond killing every iraqi man, woman and child

if the foods exposed to pesticides were dangerous they WOULDN'T SELL THEM.
arent we filled with enough toxins as is? how would organic make things any different
NO WAY.........
You think a company would expose itself to a lawsuit if the food they sold was poisonous?
beyond accidental or oversight. The food has to be regulated
mmmmm sourpussy
but i like sour food
I dont care how healthy organic food maybe - I dont want to live on this planet for 107 years
