Wow. These pre-Miyamoto games. YEESH
Kandarihu: this is game early history
early 80's probably
MadSurge, I guess so.
I must've been a toddler when this game ran it's course.
i wasnt even born when it came out
evrypony im back
hi
Kandarihu: this is older than me
I find the occasionall bleeps and blips oddly relaxing
when the c64 came with 16 colors and 32 kb of freely programmable memory, it conquered the market over night

yo
I think I started taking interest in video games when the NES came out.
thisguy: no, that was a magnet
SirGanjalf: what's the name of this game?
DaringDerpy: Adventure
oh
11,02WUT?! The castle is locked again?!

Okay. Centipede was a fixture of arcades, so I recognize this.
Was this released before Space Invaders?

Nope
Ded
Pong! :O

yeah
Kandarihu: yep
true that
DaringDerpy: agreed :D
Yeah, it seems the right paddle behaves more human-like.
i dare any child today to try that game for more than a minute
:D:P
thisguy: it's a relic
yeah, it misses more. that's how you know its human
OOOOO BREAKOUT!
No music to go by. Just Beep boop

TheRandomkid321, who else would stream old school games? SB64 is :P
Hello ShyBetaFemale
AdamTheDuck As I suspected.

U so silly
it's 10:45 in the morning you know what that means?
11,02i liek silleh :3c

#Dashiesauce
UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE
wtf is it
TheRandomkid321 because i showed up like yesterday
PeachStreak: It's just a room.
ok
ik that
ShyBetaFemale well as long as you're nothing like the other new folk I guess we can get along fine. By the way did the stream stop for anyone else?
Oh, hey guys! I got my shirts from welovefine!
what are other new people like?
11,02No outside channel links please PeachStreak
Pinkies4thWall: which ones? :3
ok
And my wonderbolts hoodie is coming next week!
sorry
ShyBetaFemale well this is only one person but... annoying.
me? annoying?
pfffff
:P
every time i come into this room you guys are streaming
what are you watching this time?
MadSurge: A chrysalis one that says 'this day is going to be perfect' and a shirt with Tsitra360's Pinkie Paint on it
And he uses incorrect grammar last time I checked. This is the 21st century people act like the intellegent beings you are.
Pinkies4thWall: nice choices!
You dropped a comma
And the Wonderbolts hoodie had to be ordered, as i wear a 2XL
Vivix ... Can it not be excused?
Only if you don't critisize the grammar of others in a way that implies it should be perfect
Meanwhile, my cat is grooming himself
man i'm in a good mood this morning
/me high fives Vivix
criticize*
:P
no stream anymore?
myy spelling ;__; jmo..help it
:P
/me high fives ShyBetaFemale
/me high fives everypony
but, yeah, everyone makes mistakes, as long as it's not absolutily unreadable, no real reason to point it out
/me high fives Pinkies4thWall
absolutely*
Vivix What I meant to say was that he uses absolutely horrid grammar. You need to capitalise the first letter of every sentence people! Anyway the person who I am basing this of of shall remain nameless.
ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM
it's me
/me licks TheRandomkid321
/me hugs Jmo
Oh you
Want a tissue diddums?
Yes...
sorry bro i can't use the shift key, my keyboard is low on ink >.>

Wasn't talking to you vivix
ShyBetaFemale Oh oka- WAIT A MINUTE!

Na you don't need one
ink is best keyboard :D
ShyBetaFemale: :D
/me steals one
I capitalize what I want! fug de gramr pls!
MadSurge :D
Grammar is important, but- it's just chatting here, so as long as it's readable- meh
05first wave of snow is expected today
05good jolly
05time to bring out the winter coat
Damnit wrek, jelly
Wreky!
Wrek Brace yourself...
hey Wrek is your name supposed to remind me of Wrex from mass effect?
because it sure as hell does
you live in the north, Wrek, right?
05aye
Wrek is Swedish, if I recall
05ShyBetaFemale: and nope
oh
:(
The only thing that sucks about winter, is that in this place we just moved to, I'm not sure if the cars will be fine with the steepness-
man i would be so happy to live in a place with a lot of snow
The best thing about winter is all insects are dead.
but here, i'm in one of the warmest cities in germany
When me moved here last winter, we got stuck in the driveway for 3 hours due to snow
Vivix, ask around
we had to call some relatives to come dig us out-
that sounds really fun Vivix
hahahaha
which one is this, ShyBetaFemale ?
freiburg :D
Yeah we asked the neighbours, it's usually fine, but last year was pretty terrible, ice under the snow and all
but i'm moving january of next year
again :/
oh, bayern
colors?
I live in Utah, and we get decent seasons here
OH because i used italics

05<Pinkies4thWall> I live in Utah, and we get decent seasons here
05<ShyBetaFemale> OH because i used italics
05* ShyBetaFemale was kicked by Wrek (You were kicked for sending 6 messages in 10 seconds. (Anti-Spam) [
I think her text color was inverted
ctrl i = invert?
Dem pings, Wrek
i'm gonna have to learn how to say more than one thing in one line in this room
I had to do the same in the beginning
So...many kicks
it's....too much....
/me has only been spamkicked once
it's impolite to flood a room with one word per line
It is, but I was, and am, soo used to steam.
hey hey hey i never did that i just...split a message up into 2 lines
hahahahaha
Wrek: erm...
DAT SWEET ASS
Oh, guys, I've been with Bronystate for over a year now!

TheRandomkid321: for me it's russian women :D
05RoboGerbil: spike

NewSuperBronyU SO no netflix? Aw. I like netflix. NO MATTER!
:O
wait
what if we watch a really bad horror movie on netflix
it could be fun!
do they have mega shark vs giant octopus?
ShyBetaFemale What do you think?
i have no idea, i don't have netflix
negro i don't even have a tv hahahaha
Netflix does not exist in Europe yet, does it?
probably doesn't
Certainly not in Norway-
ShyBetaFemale Excuse me asking. But how old are you?
20
21 next august :D
11,02ShyBetaFemale: Watch your language please.
ShyBetaFemale Okay

ShyBetaFemale DO you really not own a TV?
/me hugs NewSuperBronyU whilst geting slapped
/me licks Jmo

/me slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
I know several people who don't own TV's
ShyBetaFemale SO I take it your computer is old?
especially 20 yearolds
i live in my own apartment, no space for one, and german tv is horrible
/me gets the Chaisse lounge loaded up on a trolley for Vivix
we don't eve have COPS

Aww Yeah chaisse lounge
I love this music ^_^
what are you listening to? :D
Yeah, I like norwegian TV, but if I lived alone, I probably would not have a TV
i'm listening to the project X soundtrack
ShyBetaFemale The game music
what is the game music
I got mah tv right <3
*here
Hehe, I don't really use consoles either, so- I wouldn't need one
i don't even play video games much anymore
except for minecraft once maybe a week
I only do if something new and cool comes out-
morning Lil_B
like, I played dishonored like a bitch, and borderlands on weekends, but- before then didn't really play at all for a while
thanks ShyBetaFemale :)
:D
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Soap
and hio everyone :)
ShyBetaFeamle WAIT! It's humanly possible to go a day without Minecraft!?
/me eats soap and sulks
Ohai Lil_B :3
I stopped playing minecraft around beta 1.1
stopped playing tekkit a few months ago
TheRandomkid321 when i first got minecraft pre alpha i played every day, 8 hours, for 2 months straight
I see NewSuperBronyU is trying to make his performance better in this level xD
hey AdamTheDuck :)
Ah alpha, nostalgia
once the halloween update came in, i started losing interest, and now i just play technic pack and yogbox
YA d00d! back when you didn't have to draw your bow back hahahaha
i thikn he's just playing it for the theme music
I played technic pack for the horses-
Hehehe, the bow was waesome back then
awesome*
This game reminds me of the NES/SNES games where when you die its BACK TO THE START OF THE LEVEL FOR YOU YOU PEICE OF S#IT!
I play the oudated one
that's the only reason i'm still using yogbox
Vivix i've been playing aronud with that recently
yeah, Minecraft Alpha was fun, nothing but Mining and cutting Trees and the accasional killibng of Pigs for Meat :)
aw yeah
Vivix, hehe, back in the day when you couldn't sleep at night in Minecraft :$
This again? :D
Mutterguy, it is pretty fun, when you feel done with vanilla-
<,< yeah, you had to hide in a cave for 5 minutes
I kinda found out you don't bother copper wire
The only Mod I reaslly used was tzhe shader Mod, but it doesn't work since the full release :(
*with
/me whistles
man minecraft was so simple back then
now there is all this stuff in it, which is cool, but idk i just don't care about it
Back when Gold was 100% useless xD
ShyBetaFemale Yeah...
It was, mine all night, build all day, and the FIRE
LOL exactly Lil_B
man I burnt down our entire town due to an accident. It was so aggressive back then
Haha, ikr Lil_B :D
yeah the fire was awesome
Vivix, Oh god the fire XD
i just realized how aggressive it really was
I hear that's back in 1.3 hardmode, though
I miss the old fire mechanics
the old fire mechanics are terrifying
It was scary and awesome
one little slip up with a fireplace, and there goes hours of house work
Oh you accidentally put only 1 block on fire to your house? LET ME FIX THAT FOR YOU! Oh you wanted it put out? TO F#CKING BAD!
Terrifying... But AWESOME /)^3^(\
And since, during that period at least, leafs didn't decay, we used it to clean up after foresting
nothing like a good forest fire to stir the soul
dude yes
i always made tree houses
grew giant forests and turned them into a big home
aww yeah
no fire with me ever hahahahaha
Hehehe
Vivix yeah, I still rtemember on some servers with rules like "Clean up all the leafes after cutting down a tree!"
You can't quite get that new feeling back. You know, discovering redstone, and finding your first underground lake
yeaah
To be fair I never actually played alpha. But It was the version I love most. It's what I first saw of the game. I started playing as soon as beds came out.
Beta 1.3 I do believe.
I even use the Alpha Texturte Pack xD
nice one SB
i remember my first world on minecraft
I startedp laying shortly after halloween update I think
it had the biggest cave i had ever found, weeks exploring it and i still wasn't finished
Vivix, omg, back in the day when the shading was done in blocks rather than the smooth shading!
I wish we could get our first world back, we had one world up to the adding of..jungles I think, from alpha to beta I think
then i cut through a small wall and BOOM a new cave
so it had all our towns, and no mods
Yes!
Oh man so much nostalgia
morning Gold_Demona
Good morning Bronystate!
/me licks Gold_Demona
Morning Gold_Demona :P
good morniong Gold_Demona :)
lol hi
I think caves were a bit bigger too in alpha, they just went on forver
yeah
dat Rayman
Gold_Demona! You're just in time!
and there were less biomes
madSurge: For what?
Vivix Yours don't?
if it snowed, THE WHOLE WORLD SNOWED
Sadly, not anymore
Hehe
I have a cave i've been exploring for a month. I once got lost in their with full diamond gear for a week.
Gold_Demona: for the best level ever :D
I can't remember why we updated our world, but it was some new feature
MadSurge: Heh!
Vivix Larger biomes?
11,02Wow
TheRandomkid321, nice, haven't really been on cave exploring for ages
11,02How did I die? o3o
Vivix back then caves where awesomely long, now thy end fast after you find an abandoned mine or the underground cliffs
goodnight everypony see ya later :) <3
That was an odd death
I can't remember- it was something that wouldn't work unless you updated your worldsave
11,02Night PeachStreak :)
Bye PeachStreak
bye PeachStreak :)
Vivix Dungeons?
I think..yes
I like how there's stuff going on in the extreme foreground. XD
We had a town, where we constructed a huge wall around and lit up all the insides, to be safe from mods
no mods- just mining and building- and we lost interest when we updated worldsave, because- we lost all our work
ouch
Lot of memorization involved with this game I see.
DEMAAAA
Moojayyyyyy!
Gold_Demona: only in this level
Howsit?
I got a free shirt with Xcom Enemy unknown ^_^ my fav game as of current.
Minecraft doesn't count.
Gold_Demona: the rest of the game is more like classic platformers
Ish good. Been playing a lot of Pok?mon White 2 and Star Wars The Old Republic. :3
MadSurge: Ah, I see
Ah I see
Tis good
MadSurge: This is one of those where in the classic era winds up being one of those "infamous levels" that everybody talks about.
ohey MadSurge :)
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2697813 the great wall we had before updating worldsave
Gold_Demona: Yep
i remember when sandstone was first introduced, i spent 2 days building a massive temple in the desert
Vivix I knmow this texturte pack :P
Hehe
IN HONOR OF THE MIGHTY GOD RA
05i jsut learned a new insult
Whenever there was a big update, we would venture out and make a new time in freshly generated chunks
Gold_Demona: this is a bonus level you have to unlock through 10 other difficult levels, so you asked for it :D
so that was our last city before dungeons
Oh do share your findings with us Wrek :3
05"You are as dense as depleted uranium"
Wrek: :D
Wrek do you Pirate Music or do you Viking it?
05gotta remember that one
05i spotify it
how do you viking music?
MadSurge: LOL I see. I'd probably never make it this far. Mostly because I'm not NEARLY as patient with video games as I used to. XP
do i even want to know...
Spotify > piracy
Gold_Demona: If the game is good, my patience is limitless
Free music > spotify
we have no torrents in germany
so i have to look for the uploaded rars
feels bad man
I ddon't think Spotify has the music I want ^^"
MadSurge: This is true. If the game is good enough, I can go on almost forever.
It has most of the things I like
but I mainly listen to--hipster crap I guess
05torrents arent illegal
what kind of music do you listen to Vivix
05torrents with illegal data are illegal
05lets ban CD's cause they may contain illegal files
MadSurge: But if the game starts pissing me off, I'm MUCH less persistent with it as I used to be.
05lets ban hard drives casue they CAN contain illegal data
Gold_Demona: btw, I have Black version 2, but first I would like to do more stuff in the post final boss Black Version
ok the only one i have ever listened to is noise haha
Vivix, /)
Wrek: you will probably use that or atleast thnk of a moment to us that insult before the end of the week
Wrek let's ban RAM because the illigal Data goes though them
(\
Vivix, our tastes are not the same. Ish ovah.
Although I hahve no idea what shoegaze is Vivix :P
Gold_Demona: also, Rayman having infinite lives is really convenient
/me holds on to Jmo
Noo don't go
Wrek, lets ban people remembering things
;~;
MadSurge: Yes, I like infinite lives.
they might be able to repeat things they've seen that are copywrite
Shoegaze is--think My Bloody Valentine, Blur(kinda)--Ringo Deathstarr- maybe a bit of Jesus and Mary Chain
Let's sue everyone who is whislteing a tune
05as for me
it's basically stems from artists not moving on stage, just standing there glaring at their pedals
whistle*
05spotify provides all the music i want
05new albums of my favorite artists etc
Pretty much same here
05except maybe one or two songs that i easely find via youtube
05or pony music
Spotify is pretty damn great, AND isn't piracy. I still buy albums I love, but yeah
i'm into breakcore like venetian snares, aphex twin, datach'i, jazz fusion stuff and anything with mike patton in it
05otehr than that spotify sates my needs
i love me some mike patton unf unf unf
I kinda like Venetian Snares and Aphex
I like some electronic stuff, but it's not what I listen to the most
i LOVE venetian snares i have most of his music
05good news ShyBetaFemale: spotify has mike patton
At the moment I'm addicted to Animal Collective, woo
so does google wrek :P
idk if germany even has spotify here
ShyBetaFemale you are german too?
He needs money to eaat
yeah, well half
11,02So close ;~;
05spotify exists more or less everywhere
Yeah, it's more or less international at this point
ah ok
well i have no use for it
ShyBetaFemale just made a google search, they have it in german appearently
05heck they even have game soundtracks and even got miracle of sound
i'll just stick to "album name rar download"
05they got my vote
I don't like piracy, because artists need money, and so do their labels and representatives
Piracy. Yarr.
arrrrg
05spotify gives money directly to the artist aswell
05<3
Yeah, and it supports a lot of indie artists and obscure artists as well
05while downloading a rar does neitehr
NewSuperBronyU: don't go back to the start again! :D
but labels are usually nice people, so I don't mind paying them either
he released a new album called epicloud, it's like really happy pop metal
soooo awesome
I liked hummer
was that the name?
haha yeah
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
my favorite album by him is deconstruction
it's so gnarly
Hehe, I rarely listen to metal, so I only know him by proxy, and his ambient stuff
Very talented and inspirational dude, though
Mfw I realised I have torrented anything in months and have been fine listening to "free" artists and pony music .-.
I haven't*
I haven't downloaded music for years- I have downloaded thigns like VK Demos, that I just can
t find anymore
05folkmetal and powermetal ftw
05IN MY SWORD I TRUST
i know only a little folk and power metal
I listened to black metal when I was 13, but I moved on to visual kei/pop ish when I was 14
folkmetal? O_o
I'm sniffing coke.
Never really returned-
You like this level, don't you NewSuperBronyU :3
black metal is so awesome when the artists don't take themselves very seriously
05Gold_Demona: ill make sure to play some folkmetal ocne i stream again :P
/me steals TheRandomkid321's coke .-.
Yeah, most I've met are..nice people
Wkre: kk :3
Wrek*
TheRandomkid321: Does it smell like pepsi?
Derpdetype
AdamTheDUck But i'm so thirsty.
Petrified_Discord BETTA THAN PEPSI
Vivix http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-DKs0qfdEk
/me gives TheRandomkid321 some water
Coke dehydrates you man :<
Yeah, seen that song
Afri Cola...

AdamTheDuck: http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/25349162.jpg
admins youre dumb
one of the best off the album, aside from the mighty masturbator
we should Stream the 60's Afri Cola Commercial here xD
/me thanks... throws water away
i don't like soda that much anymore
bronys are fagets
i have none in my fridge, just milk
I know dear
NewSuperBronyU: there's nothing different if you do it in one life!
I really don't like Songs with Lyrics, it's always ether the Voice, the Text, or the way it doesn't fit with the rest that annoys me
but the few actual Songs I like are extremly high up on my Favourits List :)
the zombie survival guide also claims zombies can't climb and then says zombies can climb
AdamTheDuck... Yes I suppose.
I prefer lyrics, but I really like instrumentals too
so uh...
ShyBetaFemale Which one did you read?
Vivix, please tell me you like post rock. :<
whichever it was i read it years ago
I doo, as far as I know
I'm bad at genre names
I ahev the one published last year. So I don't have taht fact.
i like explosions in the sky and god is an astronaut :D
Vivix, gimme another one. /)
(\ aww yeaah
Still about 9ß% of my Music is from Games, and generally everything cann be there, Hip Hop, Rap, Metal, Ragtime, Jazz Orchestral, Chiptune... It's just everything xD
I think the--metalliest thing I've seen live is probably Like rats from a sinking ship, or parts of monolithic
Gold_Demona: which starter did you pick for B/W?
i saw meatloaf live
Like rats is- fun live, they threw a moog synth and a nord synth in a pile of glass and beer
i met paul gilbert once
I--hope it didn't break
I wish I could go to the Cologne_Soundtrack Concert, they have a freaking Video Game Music Workshop with som,,e awesome Composers
Nice
I rarely listen to game music- not sure why
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/31/HV3n0agluU-pfi6hFObm4Q2.jpg What's wrong with this picture? The Docter is not there.
MadSurge: Well for the first one, I cheated and gave myself my regular team that I play most of my games with. The second game I'm playing it straight, so I picked the piggy. :3
Docter.
MadSUrge: Her name is Bacon
Gold_Demona: hur hur hur :D
Is the stream on?
Gold_Demona: I picked the Snivy :3
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
Vivix: yes
You tell me.
AWw- no yt links
Vivix: keep it for later :3
Hehe, yeah
/me needs to check what his current starter is and then get b/w2
hallo everypony o.o

Not that it matters much :P

ShyBetaFemale: I'm just perpetually in free-fall

Trondheim Calling 2011, I think I was at this show http://youtu.be/LQjTm6RZh7k
Whats happening?
ShyBetaFemale Rarity is best :)
Petrified_Discord how do you tell?
rarity is cool, i like all of them but fluttershy, she ain't my cup of tea
TheRandomkid321: A mod posted it in-chat and I saved it
Petrified_Discord Any Australian ones?
ever mark the wrong side of some thing then you have one of those 'damn it' moments where you have to start again and waist material?
TheRainbowDawn: Eenope
failtab :P
Beep.
ShyBetaFemale: come on, you cant not like flutters, you just dont like her as much as the other ponies.
Petrified_Discord both :| and GODDAMNIT!
ShyBetaFemale well, I actually only really like Twi and Rarity, after that maybe RD, Fluttershy than AJ and PP
I think I like Fluttershy Pinkie and Rarity the most
TheRandomkid321: I think it only matters when they stream movies and open the smaller chatrooms. I often join through a random server anyway.
lol DoctoDoctorWho i just don't like her
Regardless of choosing RD

MadSurge: LOL, yes I do. Though it was my husband who named him. XD
Yay Phase4 stream
Gold_Demona: :D

That's fine. Go ahead and scare the shit out of me stream XD
AdamTheDuck, silly adam, refresh

MadSurge: Big honkin 30-pound cats are great. XD
MadSurge: He sits on me, and my lap disappears
i once saw my cat catch a squirrel and he ate everything, the head, bones, everything
like what the hell
Yes! Cat is boolit-proof!
ShyBetaFemale: :O
My cats never go outside
i took pictures too and showed all my friends
They've never seen the outside.
so who has magicka?
ShyBetaFemale ... at least you saved the money for food ...
need 3 players
Neither have I/
Cats always look at me like I'm an idiot. I don't know how to impress them. I don't think I can.
:>
one of you must have it :<
Lil_B he used to be so fat
I think i own it....
hmm
I have it, and I have a new internet
Liar.
wow, missile silos are expencive
Petrified_Discord you can't impress cats, they are cats, they are designed for old ladies
not installed because of small HDD issues
Gold_Demona: my previous cat was like that. My current cat likes going outside :)
"I THINK I own this game" ... we are all way woo wealthy -.-
lol
no that was just steam sales
MadSurge: Whether my cats want to or not is irrelevant. We don't let our cats outside.
Phase4: pshaw, you can get one for just under 1.4 million dollars
Gold_Demona: but she doesn't like sitting on laps. Just close to sitting people :D
ShyBetaFemale: I would have thought opposable thumbs would be good enough. It's like, I can HOLD things. Hey cat, can you get the phone? No? You can't because you're a cat? Okay then.
DoctoDoctorWho, 6_9
cats don't care about holding things Petrified_Discord hahaha :P
Gold_Demona: do you live on a dangerous zone? O_o
I see Magika o.o
Guy on JS chat on Stackoverflow- asking a question, that is so vague, that it sounds more like a statement
/me wat do
awwww i'm so proud of my little sister
Hurt him.
Vivix, whats the question
I'm playing Retro City Rampage now, I'll see if it somehow allows me to pop in the chat
she was starting to gain weight and i lectured her on how to lose weight and since may she's lost like 20 lbs
"how do I give 200, 300, 20, 50 in percentage?" and I'm like wat? and he says "Whether we can take x1=200,y1 = 300 and so on" and..I have no ida what he actually means
......
wut o.o..
Does he want to know how to ..turn numbers into percentage?..Wat?
Vivix, thats not only vague, its imposible to answer
MadSurge: Also the risk of them getting run over by a car
Vivix: Dafuq?
Yeah- I'm stuck
LOL
MadSurge: Or picked up by somebody else
IMPOSSIBRU
Vivix: Just link him to "ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?"
Phase4: the government is selling old nuclear launch silo's to the public as refurbished houses, with all the important bits taken out of course.
Vivix yeah... you need more Information too rewsolve this Problem -.-
hehe yeah
Ehh screw homework, I'll leave it for later :$
Still playing Magicka Phase4?
AdamTheDuck: /)
DoctoDoctorWho, think i read about that
Petrified_Discord, (\
MadSurge: Also, they don't know how to live outside.
I want to play Magika now..
AdamTheDuck, havent played in a while
LightTrooper105, fire it up, i'm playing multiplayer
ok, I can't pop in the chat :/
roger\
MadSurge: They've been indoor cats since they were born
Sorrry Phase4 need to uninstall stuff in order to play :(
:(
Gold_Demona: we live in a quiet periphery apartment block with a nice lawn, so she stays always close
:|
one sec
alligning things
Gold_Demona: I've seen her catch a few birds, but nothing special. And our vet is a wonderful person
He needs it in percentage, to support ipad, and android tablets
hmm
/me shrugs
Vivix: So like...decimals? Dafuq is this kid talking about?
Fuuuuuuuuuu, I didn't back up Magicka Phase4 :(
:(
I'm not sure- I think he might be using a library that gives him a function- he says eh: var ball=new entity(1,'ball',200,300,20,50,100,'red',0,10,0,10,0,true,false,0,true,1,0.95,'','??balls/bone.png');
Wait, might be on the old computer, let me check~
i cant volume because of the ad
Phase4 Why don't you have adblock?
DashWithRainbows, i have one in firefox, nto in chrome

Ahah!
AdamTheDuck: Ponies are already answer to everything

Huh. I guess it IS morning.

Jmo, 118.209.0.138
you may have to go through the friends list
Gold_Demona: have you played RA2 Yuri's revenge?
that what I did
Oh when did it get an update
recently
new dlc
Fffffff
DoctoDoctorWho: I've actually never played any. They all belong to my husband. :P
ah, he any good?
DoctoDoctorWho: But yeah, I've seen him play Yuri's Revenge
ahd the good old days..
DoctoDoctorWho: yes he is
LightTrooper105, ValtheJean: start now and restart when we get anouther player?
This update is gona take like 20 minutes, will have to go without.
stupidly op if you use him right
Phase4 your choice
is it sooo needed to have one extra just try whit 3 guys makes ur day up (just an tip)
2,14 up to you
taoumi: wut?:|
yuri DoctoDoctorWho
ah yeah I know, but I was talking about demona's husband
hmm
/me <3 the humor
11,02Hai ValtheJean :)
ha just freed up space from mass effect
wth..
my game just close it self..
and then it seized up
dat sims talk
Gold_Demona: does your husband still play?
taoumi: ikr
Magicka is funny sometimes if you know Swedish
lol my char still there
when im not xD
DoctoDoctorWho: Nah, not so much anymore. It's collecting dust right now
shame, I would have loved to meet him in a match
DoctoDoctorWho: He never plays MP
DoctoDoctorWho: He usually just plays the campaign or one of the single-player maps.
DoctoDoctorWho <3 Ra2 but didn't really play it online
LightTrooper105, rejoin?
sure
so Mutterguy and AdamTheDuck both need to install
its a race
:<
winner gets to play
:>
How long do they have?
Knowing my unreliable internet, I have a feeling Mutterguy will win :$
fine I just clicked installl.
DoctoDoctorWho: In fact, he's like me in that we never play online with other people if we can help it unless it's with each other or someone we know, and always in a team against computers.
as long as it takes
Till the end of time itself?
Unless the taupo super volcano goes or the local fault line does a biggy in the next 30 minutes i should be fine
DoctoDoctorWho: Which is why it took me so long to get into TF2. I don't like playing with random people. XP
I'm gonna be done in 7~ minutes
so lul.
Best part about Magicka is griefing your friends :D
Gold_Demona: the only thing I dont like about online play is you have to be godly at the game just to avoid getting slaughtered
w..t..f i try again to join my magicka when i do it shuts itself down :D
DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah, that's another reason why we don't play with random people. We both suck. =/
Co-op4eva
have they killed them selves yest?
any1 does know how i can repair it? :)
Spark, are you playing on a laptop?
nope
Gold_Demona: that's why TF2 is better than Call of Duty, you can have tons of fun even if you're a scrub :D
it just laggs that it cant run it even i did the so called ''install''
Gold_Demona: Im sure you dont suck, its just 90% of people online have sold their souls to the game and do nothing else:D
:)
MadSurge: This is true. Though TF2 is the only FPS online game I've ever played. lol
DoctoDoctorWho: that too
233 mb\
DoctoDoctorWho: Well, I've never played C&C, so I'm sure I'd suck at that lol.
um
So much lag Phase4 XD
Everyone is just teleporting
i bet that i need just delete 1 thing what i cant find :D
you can probably check game integrity
if you have it on steam
Oh PvZ Sequel
i tryed youtube it tells to go into pb where i wont go :/
I remember when I first played the game, AI was on easy and kicked my @$$ every time
Jmo: srsly?! :O
i bet it's with hats and you have to get it through origins
Gold_Demona: there's a macro summing it up best: "30 shots to the face, he kills you first; knife to the foot, instant death" :D
It was announced in August too. wow o.o
How'd that slip past
CnC AI was ruthless
I think they start witha built base in the early ones, because they can't build on their own , only repair and rebuild
something like that-
in skirmish, not campaign
Oh yeah... EA owns PopCap now... FFFUUUUUUUUU
Yeah..
>.>
Yay Magicka is done
curses!
Ah well, will be interesting to see what they're gonna do.
Mr duck , you win
Vivix: the AI doesnt match my playstyle though
But I don't wanna buy through Origin! T^T
Origin sucks bawls
Same, I like to just build and build and do diplomatics
Ah don't worry
You'll be able to buy it through Steam I'm sure.
:>
Jmo: But I though Steam wasn't gonna cary EA games anymore.
Jmo: That's why you can't get Mass Effect 3 on there
if EA makes more money with Steam, they are basically forced to- but seems they don't want to
Look at Crysis 2
It was removed then put back on
Gold_Demona, this is from "15 things you'll never hear a gamer say" http://derpy.me/J9SYA
EA needs all the money they can get-
But yeah
Jmo: But none of EA's new games are on Steam.
Origin
Vivix: Im a turtle, so by the time im up to full steam Im either dead or the AI has no fight left in it.
wattajoke
Touche.
DoctoDoctorWho, aw yeah. Have you ever played eh Rise of Nations? It kinda suited that slow build style-
Maybe it'll pop up on BigFish... The first game is on there, so why not?
Ill have to check it out
Gold_Demona, and this one you might understand more. http://derpy.me/UPORI
lawl
AdamTheDuck: lol
Why does everyone hate Garbodor? :(
It'll be nice if I can buy it through BigFish. Here's hoping. *crosses fingers*
Honestly if it isn't on Steam, EA can rot in hell and I will cry like a little girl.
MadSurge: cuz he's a piece of trash...
hehehe
NewSuperBronyU, if you're not asleep yet :P http://derpy.me/5HOT3
DoctoDoctorWho: but he's cute :(
Jmo: I'm not holding my breath for it to be on Steam. If it DOES end up on Steam, I'd be very pleasantly surprised.
MadSurge: complete garbage
A MAN CAN DREAM ;__;
/me rolls around crying
Jmo: That's why I'm hoping it'll be available on BigFish
DoctoDoctorWho: what about the giant pile of sludge and the bubble of toxic gas?
we suck
AdamTheDuck, Mutterguy: either of you ready?
MadSurge: which ones
?*
eenope
DoctoDoctorWho: Grimer/Muck and Koffing/Wheezing
Still annoyed that console versions of the first one got co-op but not PC. QQ
Tiem 4 berkferst. brb
MadSurge: I dont like them either, but my bro had a muk that he adored
nice thing about makeing a pony that's not for comision. it dosen't have to be flawless
Jmo: There's coop? O.o
Those are poison too but they get not even half of the shit that Garbodor had to go through :(
Phase4, eeyup
raised the damn thing to lvl 70
Console versions have it yeah :<

Can't connect for some reason Phase4 :<
DoctoDoctorWho, please don't be stupid on me.
that means he must connect through friends list now
Kandarihu: Well dear sir, I apologise for making a comment that I found to be humorous at the time. Excuse me.

Don't think so

Yeah but I feel lazy this today :P
*this day

I didn't know you could hit tab to complete a name until quite recently.
Good morning, everyone! :)
I never knew what people meant when they said "tab fail".

Ohai RaveBrony

I don't have Magicka
I'm in bed. It's 12:19am •_•
:o
XAX, lol same, just too lazy today to do much :$
XAX AdamTheDuck lucky ._.
So who heard Halo 4 was leaked and you can actually torrent it at the moment?
o.o
You can play it if you have an Xbox that can run burned discs.
I don't really care for Halo, or half of the games in the FPS genre, anyway.
Haha, my friend gave me the biggest scare concerning Halo 4.
I'm more of a Platformer and RPG guy.
He was like: Dude, they fixed Halo man, don't worry. They added irong sights.
Oh, and also, bullet hell/danmaku.
Lol.
And I shat my pants XD
That's like adding iron sights to counter strike.
You don't do it.
^ You just don't.
XAX, it was
leaked i meen
Phase4: Indeed.
And the leaker was IM Meen
:P
I actually have the torrent in my utorrent at the moment.
Not downloading atm though.
Heh, the NewSuperBronyU|Zzz announcement earlier today.
Hahaha
And what was that?
Wii U, that is all. XD
Lol.
"Wii U is coming out in 34 days" or something like that.
Could've used Tom for that though. :P
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
Air date is one of the following:
November 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th

Lucky. .-.
Pfffft, 4 am for me
Oh lord, the first world problems I must suffer.
I would kill for 6 am actually
I have to stay up at night
Like, 1 AM
I remember before dragon quest, I stayed up all night beforehand on CoD4 ._.
Pfft, CoD 1 was best CoD.
I have that game somewhere on my external HD.
What about 2?
I have to go to bed at 10:00 PM but usually I'm not sleepy at that time. I'll stay up for another 2 hours maybe 3 and I get up at 6 AM no matter what
2 was cool as well
Noep ._.
Don't have 2 :c
:<
But the Normandy Landings
It was an awesome mission :<
Ohgod I saw on 4chan /mlp/ that a while back, they held an event where they versed ponychan at TF2
The event was called spaghetti bowl or something
They're planning a second event on a different game lol
.-.
Ponychan vs 4chan
;~;
That and reddit, all these places I have not yet visited on my time on the internet.
Phase4: egad i crashed!

Goodnight everyone
AdamTheDuck: Lucky. Good night :<
/me is downloading all the pony mods for that server Phase4 is on
AdamTheDuck: Later.
XD
Is it a bad thing when your bed is to max cozy before a school day and oversleep?
RoboGerbil, prepare for a long wait
Phase4: lol im on sounds
Spell-of-Gaming, just dont go to school and sleep all day
I seriously have a nice history teacher.
We can say "I don't know" on a question and not be mad at it.
He'll be pretty strict in needed times, though.
i dont know why i watch the news its all doom and gloom
i broke windows
TF2 crashed, then?
ouch that sucks
Phase4: Told ya one day youd outsmart your computer >:3
XD
Spell-of-Gaming, nah, glob() forgot how to files
Pokemon B&W GTS Exploition is pretty interesting
I've tried it, and frankly, it's a bit buggy.
I found a server which gives Porygon2 and it's possible to evolve it to Porygon-Z inside the Global Terminal
BTW, I have a Surfing Jigglypuff
hai ded chat

I'm pretty indifferent to PewDiePie, but dude needs to lower the volume
d3rb: I already saw Slowbeef, but not Diabeetus
i never knew pewdiepie screamed that much. i dont watch his stuff
i finaly get all the hate
Also, less rape jokes please :(
ikr
you can scream rape as much as you want in your stupid voice but itas still not funny
Nova at least never uses those, just yells

http://i.imgur.com/K05nB.jpg

dafuq did I just say.
thanks Jmo
...
Ate and poowerfool twizzly.... hiya
hey
Gold_Demona what game D:
Jmo: The one whose gameplay MadSurge linked us to a while ago. :P
ah
Righto
gives pandapanda a thumbsup
/me rolls around
The Ponyville game
Oh that one
can't wait for that
I have several. ;_;
I have neither Android or iOS
Naw.
Gold_Demona: apparently it will be available for all things with Android
Poor Dema
MadSurge: I have no Android
My phone is a RAZR
HOHOHOHOHOHO
The OLD one that's not a smartphone
RAZR
Gold_Demona: awww :( go play Adventure Ponies then
I still remember having one of those. My god
wow those things
My phone is not a smart pony. :<
but it flips!
flip phones are bad-ass.
True. That it does. :D
iphone does not flip
Nope
therefore, better
And my phone sits nicely on my phone-holder that looks like a couch. :P
why would you ever want to upgrade then?
I don't. It just makes me sad when things like this come out and I can't play them. :<
/me hugs Gold_Demona
There there, you will get to enjoy it sometime.
Maybe, Jmo. Maybe
But I think my phone will live forever. XD
I've had it for years
Eh
LOL
Can get an Android phone for cheapest of $50 here
Yeah, you can get them pretty cheap here too, but the trick is adding the smartphone data service to my phone plan
Right now I have talk and text on my plan. Data is extra.
Huzzah
Huzzah?
O.o
>.>
I dunno
I r bored ;~;
I use Wifi, but all the phoneservices automatically include minimum data plan
in this country that is- as far as I know
I'm stuck trying to come up with names for my characters in TOR. >.>
<.<
I keep getting booted from server cuz I'm idle too long trying to think of a name
i have more data than i need, if i could i'd lend you some Gold_Demona
My lord Dema >.<
lol
Wut Jmo? O.o
It's a name D:
Yeah, but names are hard. :<
I want to make good names...
Silly silly silly dema.
I suck at making good names...
The only place where names are totally--mean are games like Skryim and whatnot, you enver hear your name again
I only know how to make silly names...
yet, you spend 20 minutes -
:<
<,< I once went through fallout1 with a char named 'name'
make your name srs_demona
LOL Vivix. XD
Hehehe
lol d3rb, That's not gonna work. XD
but people will see the srs and know you mean business
What kinda names do they use on--TOR?
lol
Bounty hunter? I'd call it Derphunter.
Woop
/me is not sure what that is, or if that was what was typed
Gold_Demona: I liked making names for all my Pokemon :D
TOR - The old republic.
Aah
Same as most MMOs. They're not usernames, but character names.
I haven't watched enough star wars to know any naming patterns-
but it's always fun to get a name that sounds..like it belongs
Yeah
Vivix: ikr
That's why it's so hard for me. I have a REALLY hard time finding names that belong to the characters. :<
MadSurge: I ALWAYS name my pok?mon. :3
My names are either punny or serious :D
No obscenities
Yeah, Pok?mon names are a lot easier. Anything goes.
My starter in White 2 is named Bacon. :3
Hehe
heh
I've never played pokemon ;__;
:O
Vivix: :O
and I LIKE naming pets, so maybe I should- but..battles
What about battles?
but Vivix ...its sooo good!
I'm not so fond of battles-
Why not?
/me shrugs
World peace.
It's just like any other rpg
I think it's just not my style of fighting in games-
I tend to stick to wrpg style
wrpg?
Vivix used hug on roket grunt...it has no effect
or crpg, whichever name is right
You hate battles but you would slowly torture someone in Fallout
Hehehe
or burn down a city in Dishonored
Nuh huh!
Torture is baad
crpg? O_o
<,<..that was an accident
Uh-huh
Computer rpg, like fallout or baldurs gate
Vivix: you mean action rpgs?
UH-HUH
noot--actions per se
Oh
LOL.
dat kick
woops
not action, but DnD'y
stratagy
I prefer BOATLOADS of dialog and walking over much combat, I guess
?
HE LOVES FALLOUT STYLE GAMES
Not sure what it goes under-
NUFF SAID
yeah, fallout and baldurs gate
I like Dungeon Crawlers too
but yeah, only pokemon I've tried was ehh..that stadium one, friend of mine ha
d
LOL Stadium doesn't count
you mean the worst one
dungeon crawlers are fun too, like nethack or..dungeon master(name?)- legends of grimrock
it's THE worst?
I liked Etrian Odyssey
Oi
It ain't the worst
<m< I need to download a emulator
Nonono the REAL Pok?mon games have actual story to them
ok the camera one is the worst
Goodgood, because story is the best reason to play
Not a lot of story, mind you, but enough to keep it interesting
Oi
Pokemon Snap was golden
You arse.
oh cmon, really?
Jmo: No! The best was Hey You! Pikachu!
because I like pokemons, and I like reading pokemon fiction- especially feral, but never really played the games
AHAHA
Dema got it.
Gold_Demona: so B/W is an exception? because that one had quite a story
MadSurge: Yeah, I was about to say, if you want story to start with Black or White
5th Gen is QUITE story intensive
It's like fighting PETA :D
LOL yup XD
Hehe
Well, then I might pick that one up
I'm not very familiar with pokemons, but yeah- I enjoy their visaage
POKEMANS.
black and white is the first game to get a sequal
sequal
Keep in mind that Black and White are both pretty much exactly the same game but with a few different pok?mon.
aah
Gold_Demona: thought so
What eh..
platform is it for?
DS
/me snaps fingers
Yup DS
I don't like emulating new ish things, cause..you know, piracy
but--buying a ds <,< not sure-
Vivix: watch out to not get the tweaked rom :D
Oh, you don't have a DS...
ima buttpirate
yarhar
Um...
I might try it out on emu and buy it if I like it- not sure what DS costs now adays
MadSurge, tweaked? D=
That complicates matters cuz all the actual pok?mon games are on Gameboy or DS
^
yeah, I kinda grew up without nintendo
You poor poor soul. :<
/me hugs Vivix
;__;
Pfffft
my dad was a complete computer nerd, and ironicly, my mother is and was a huuuge nintendo nerd
/me gives Vivix a muffin
everyone needs a LITLE bit of nintendo
so I grew up with computers
Mufffin
Vivix: early roms had a safefail bug that made pirate copies not give you any experience
Aah
I think I'm the only one who grew up with everything video games. I had a lot of different consoles AND computer games.
I think that's the same for the other games too
My dad was a huge gamer, so most of the computer games were his, but I played them anyway. :P
Hehe, we had a Sega Mega, as it was called in europe, and my mother would sometimes play a nintendo with mario, but I grew up playing computer and amiga games
I actually didn't have any handheld games until the first Pok?mon came out.
same
dat ? >.>
By then I was old enough to by my own gameboy, so that wasn't a big deal. :P
I've yet to own anything handheld, for games specifically
what was the point of owning one before that
Gold_Demona: I had a NES, but didn't use it much because I was too little :D I played mostly arcade games and PC platformers
Game and Watch. ;__;
YOU'RE ALL CRUEL
Hehe
Gold_Demona: GameBoy :3
I got an NES when I was like 4 or 5
My family and I played the crap out of Duck Hunt and Super Mario Bros
dDuck Hunt!
Hell yeah Duck Hunt
I used to play that at my uncles house
was always fascinated by how the gun worked
Gold_Demona: my first GB game was the Killer Instinct port, which was quite good!
i still got my old nes
I got a Sega Genesis some time later, so I grew up with Mario AND Sonic.
And mind you, I hated fighting games back then
we had a sega mega, me and my sister, which was genesis in usa- but eh I don't think we had sonic
I always liked fighting games, but I've never been any good at them. :P
morning, everypony :)
hey Sylandest
You southern horse
My sister still has our genesis.
Yp
yo* darnit
howdy d3rb, Vivix :)
Hiyo Sylandest
Gold_Demona: I've been always better at Final Fight style games :D
howdy, Gold_Demona! :)
Hello Sylandest!
MadSurge: The games I'm best at is puzzle games.
I still have our sega mega controller, but that's about it, dunno where the machine is
are*
I prefer dialog heavy and talky games, not sure why
I like most kinds of games
not really good at any games, but- still fun
Gold_Demona: those are good, but my fav games are still platformers :3
I'm not overly picky
^
goodnight everypony :P take it easy
howdy MadSurge!
And what are we talking about today?
I'm not usually either, but- I think dialog heavy and good story kinda makes it stand ou to me, not sure
I mean, half life is one of my all time favs, and there's hardly no dialog-
The only games I dislike are racing and sports videogames
I love platformers! Especially the classic 2d ones
I think only I avoid are games like final fantasy and sports <,<
Yeah, I don't like sports games. Controls are too weird for me
Sif avoid FF games
I used to love Final Fantasy.
Ish ovah veeveex.
</3
/me hugs Jmo, wont let him go
So clingy.
I can see why people like theem but yeah
not for me- sadly
Final Fantasy stopped being good after 10
Oh that hurts
I love the stories in 6, 7, and 9
/me strokes Jmo
8 was boring.
FF Movies are the bomb ;~;
12 was the last one I played and it was boring
I might only have played 7 or 8 and 11
/me sits on Gold_Demona
Nu-uh
11's the MMO
okay not 11 then-
it had rikku, and some..girl..in black called payne or rayne
That was 10-2
Ah yes
^
I like 10-2. It's fun in its own way
And I kinda like the outfits, even if some of them are um... kinky. :P
I think the reason they're not for me is just because- my first meeting with games with that kinda gameplay was fairly late in my life
like --17 I think
Haay sexy laadies.
16-
something like that
Me too Vivix
I didn't know Final Fantasy existed until I was like 15
wowza o.o
Then I played 7 for the first time when I was 16
Hehe, yeah same here. Got to know some people in school who loved it so much, basically made me run check it out when 10-2 came ou
8 was the newest one when I started playing.
I didn't play 8 till much much later, but it was there
Ah yeah
I bought 9 when it came out and really liked it. Then I got 10 and really liked it. Then after that Final Fantasy went downhill...
My friend was totally addicted to Sephiroth, so she told me to play the one with him
The stories ceased to be well-written
and I think a borrowed a black and white copy of it (piirates everywhere)
lol
Ah yeah, in games it takes--a good story, not just flashy styles
or at least consistent quality
Sephiroth's good as a villain, but he's WAY overrated.
^
Hehe, he's ERRYWHER
But yeah she was totally into him at the time-
I hate that ass in KH.
He's not even the best Final Fantasy villain. He's only second best.
I never got that far as to meet him in the game, and don't really know any of the other villains-
There has yet to be a villain more villainous than Kefka from 6
Kefka I've seen eh drawn art of, but that's about it
That mofo was NUTS
He sought out to destroy the world... On purpose... and succeeded.
!
I like nuts.
Halfway through the game he completely fucks up the world
I'm suure you do
That didn't come out right.
At all.
THat sounds pretty cool
Yeah, 6 was awesome
That one was for Super Nintendo
I think it's mainly the gameplay that set me away, because it all sounds like something I'd love to read
For me it's tied with 7 as best Final Fantasy
You gonna be getting the PC vesrion Dema? :O
version*
PC Version of what Jmo? O_o
FF7
Why? I have the original PS1 version. :P
Psshtt
Hehe
Doesn't hurt
Plus there's achievements
Achieeveements D:
/me has both
The only way I'd buy FF7 again is if they update the graphics to today's standard.
wow
Get it on it fandom!
the game was awesome as is
You did it to morrowind, you could do it again
Huh it's on special too
heh
The water in Morrowind extended is superior to the shaders in skyrim-
it's..bizarre
lol Achievements. Wow, that's SUCH a selling point. XD
:<
/me likes achievements
I like achievements to, but that's not a selling point for me. :P
too*
http://www.confrerie-des-traducteurs.fr/forum/upload/Inny/Inny_1318587984_41808_1296411867.jpg
IT HAS PONIES IN IT
I like fun achievments- or strange ones
Ponies?! Imma get it RIGHT NAO!
woopwoop.
FUP YEH
winrar
:D
lol
/me has a pony
I still haven't played Pony Fantasy 6
wait
what?
LOL
pony fantasy?
I have it in my rom collection, but I've yet to play it
omg
link me now!
Wow it's legit
pony fantasy makes it sound dirty
I must play it!
http://pony-fantasy-6.com/
/me is just saying
Vivix... my mind is always in the gutter anyways
Oh baby.
Ohmai!
Hehe
Sounds cool
ima put you in one of those pony costumes Vivix for halloween
ahahaha
But yeah, I know what you mean about taste in gameplay being a hinderance, Vivix.
I can never get through Fire Emblem because I can't stand that "chess board" battle system.
But I LOVE the story.
Oh my god Fire Emblem
Story is so good ;_;
Ah yes, things like that
The one I have is the one with Ike
Gameplay as welll
/me dances for Jmo in costume
._.
You're too attached veeveex.
/me stops
Also the fact that characters die permanently was a huge turnoff for me
ish ovah D;
;__; i soreh
If they die in a fight, they're gone forever
Permadeaath
So you BETTER NOT LET THEM DIE!!!
what yall talking about now?
They had that in black and white, by lionhead, but one of the devs got so sad when his creature died, they disabled it
Fire Emblem
Ponies
ahh
LIES.
thought u were talking about xcoim :(
lolxcom
xcom*
xcom?
no fir emblen and games in general
What is xcom?
hey its a good game damnit
XCOM was fun
Not even bothering to notice it
XCOM is like--fight aliens strategy old computer game
the only thing that confuses me is that I saw a repot on the upcoming one long ago thatl ooked amazing, yet the one that came out looks ..meh
I see
what happened there?
they just released a new xcom like 1-2 weeks ago
mid 90s typical computer game
Gold_Demona: it's one of those games where if you had one soldier killed and two injured with some loot it was a great match :D
heh
Hehe, it was pretty fun, but- hard
I never really played it until recent times though, but the new one didn't grab any interest-
Vivix: at least it's not the shitty FPS we saw months ago
Hehehe
Anyone excited about the new KingsQuest game that TellTaleGames is supposedly coming out with?
Which FPS game?
Oh
igeddit
Gold_Demona: kinda :$
not familiar with kingsquest
the ds one? or one for a console?
I wonder if it's gonna be a retelling of the original KingsQuest lore or if it's gonna be an all new story.
Neither ;_;
i must have a dif game in mind then
Vivix: classic adventure game with tons of cheap deaths :D
Woop
LOL yup
ah Sierra
I remember Gabriel Knight
Only thing I remember from Sierra is leisure suit Larry
AHAHAHA
and that's because--kids think that shit is funny
hehehe
haha lsl....
Gold_Demona: did you see the bit with Twilight as Graham on Anthology 2? :D
MadSurge: Yesh, I loved that bit. :3
I recognized it immediately. :D
/me slaps Jmo around a bit with a large wub
It's one of the first ridiculous deaths of the first KingsQuest game
Gold_Demona: PERFECT. Stupid death, obscure hint, rubbing it in your face.
/me slaps Panda around a bit with a large trout
:(
MadSurge: LOL IKR?
A trout of love <3
dem trouts get a workout it seems on this site
Jmo, mind helping me out?
/me slaps naturesfury around a bit with a large trout
Only if Jmo is around. He's the one with the trouts
/me slaps Gold_Demona around a bit with a large trout
wrong
With wut :o
Did you try the recent remakes of the first three games?
Whatchu need sexay panda
Jmo, I have art block....
Jmo! He stole your trout! D:
osnap
Art block
Gold_Demona ^
I wonder if I have a trout
/me gives Jmo a hearty slap
Whatever shall you do D:
Not a trout it seems-
MadSurge: To be perfectly honest. I've never actually played any of them. But I've seen a full Let's Play series of all the games.
like no joke, I could build a house with my art block Jmo.
And you're asking me for things to draw?
eeyup
All I'm gonna scream at you is DERPY.
MadSurge: I think my dad had the first game, but I never made it very far in it. :P
Gold_Demona: the freeware remakes are good because you can't screw yourself over a puzzle because you used an item when you shouldn't have
Or draw a house
MadSurge: That's good.
MadSurge: Yeah, the early games were real DICKS about that
A lot of old games were totally unforgiving
Yup
Jmo, well derpy would be good... though... i dont have any ideas.... which just prolongs the block.
Derpy with the TARDIS :>
Derpy eating flowers while hitting Twilight with muffins
Gold_Demona: you get an instant death upon using it or there are multiple solutions to the puzzle.
Panda: Derpy popping out of a muffin.
Panda: Wearing a top hat
is KingsQuest a dungeon crawler?
*googlsz
Panda: and a monocle
derpy vs goku fighting for the muffen button = greatness
Panda: And holding a cane
ew
Vivix: nope, a point and click game series
Oooh~~
Point and click adventure
If I was in a comical mood, those would suffice.
Well, I still have to finish Monkey Island, but ever since broken sword, I've loved point and click
Unless you're playing the first few games in their original form... In which case you type in what you want the character to do. XD
D:
Ooh, I kinda like that too. Like muds or..
stuff
go e go e go e go e you died
If you want him to pick up the rock, you type in "pick up rock"
Vivix: OOOH, Monkey Island <3
Hehe, indeed
Vivix: can you hold your breath for 10 minutes?
Zork.
LOL Wasn't Zork ALL text though. XD
?
Oh I--kinda remember what that means
Yep
Yup
Zork was all text yeah, 1972 MIT?
but MUDS, dude I played muds on linux
Zork4lyf
muds were fun, all text rpg with nerds
I've never even seen it in action, I only know about it by reputation
Oh boy
You've missed out :P
muds eh were the precursor to MMOs
I was born in 84. Too young for text RPGs. :P
The Godfather of RPG
Holy crap, something I'm too young for!
Hehe I was born in 1989 ;__; I played some
Same Gold_Demona
whats a MIT?
whats a MUDS?
in fact, I sitll play text adventures
MIT is Massachussets institute of technology
I was born in 1984
/me cant follow the convo
MUD is .. an engine for text adventure games for multiplep layers, basicly multiplayer rpg
MIT is the school Gordon Freeman went to. :D
/me hugs Panda
Indeed he diid
http://noahgibbs.github.com/RailsGame/building/aardwolf-mud-2.jpg heres a mud game
Gordon Freeman is younger than me... *feels old*
It's--actually REALLY fun if you get into it
Morning, guys
/me fluffs ASoftFluffyThing
morning, ASoftFluffyThing
HAYO
Hiyo ASoftFluffyThing
Hello ASoftFluffyThing!

/me hugs Sylandest, Gold_Demona, MadSurge, naturesfury, and Jmo
Huzzah for hugs

Yay, hugs! \8D/
rofl
Cow? O.o
Hehe
Moo.
Moo
Despite having not played the KingsQuest series, I do like point and clink games. :3
Moo.
I think best point and click I played was Broken Sword
Most of them have a goofy sense of humor which I really enjoy. XD
SpaceQuest was a good game series too. I only played through a couple of them though. Watched a Let's Play of the rest.
Oi, I know... something attractive.
hm?
o.O
Jmo hm?
Flag that tail!
What do you mean attractive >.>
O_o
Jmo, you know... curvy women and what not.
eh
Thought you meant in a different context, nevermind~
Continue drawwing
Jmo, well.. what do you define as attractive?
Well
Sttuuuff
I dunno really.
Doesn't bother me
Ello there everybrony.
Jmo, well if you have an ideas, send them my way XD
Hyello
Yo chat, y'alright?
/me Chat: No..It hurts to breathe
:<
Fo'sho brotha.
No no. I can breathe just fine Dr. Vivix
Jmo: *gurgle* *spits apple*
It hurts to PEE
Ahahaha
I'm looking at Mudconnect, suddenly..want to play..muds with old guys..
It hurts when IP.
hehe
Barbetos|AtWork: why does it hurt when I pee?
Also I left with Lyra and I can't remember what happened.
You want to play with old men?
wat.
my wallet is also missing.
WE --MEED
JMO!
ROFL
We need a pony mud!
We fucking need a pony mud!
/me passes out in realization
I agree
Soapo
Why has this not happened yet?
Muds aren't even hard to make! You just need good writers and..a lot of room makers
hell, muds hardly had npc's as far as I remember-
I can write things!
/me eats soap
/me pokes Vivixs eye
Ah! Damnit
egghh
but oh a social--mud with adventures- why not
You haven't lived until you've died in MUD
/me pokes Jmo's eye
Hehe
I have no eyes.
What now.
/me pokes your throat
brb darlings
Remind me what MUD is?
Multi-user dungeon
multi user dungeon. eh
http://www.mudconnect.com/ some info here
wiki and muschlient has better info, kinda
brb
Such a nerd Vivix.
<3
ah
/me rolls around Dema
woopwoop
sudden visitor
SO. Pony mud?
Yes?
o.o
yeah it is pretty nerdy- but wouldn't that be fun to hang out in? Hang out, be a pegasus, fight hydras
oh yeah for sure
It's basically IRC with a world and actions
Si senior.
lolsenior
=P
Everyone is a senior to el barbie
He is kind of slow
currenlty zero hits on pony in server list
Hehe

but there's five harry potter servers
Excitement
Excite Pony Bike
=o
The ideas!
Demaa D:
My power supply blinked. :<
:<
It decided "No, I can't!" and turned both my computers off
Bad power supply.
Need a new one. This one might be going bad. =/
Aww-
If it's randomly blinking off for no reason
My last one went bad, fan broke and it started doing weird stuff-
Oh, no it's not my computer power supply. Um... It's like a power strip but it's a battery?
Wonder why I was thinking UPS.
Oh
I was right
Ooh
Hehe
How about that. Ahaha
Yesh Jmo. That's the word I was after. A UPS. :>
Never had one of those-
Was thinking how does one power supply shut down two computers, must be a UPS.
lol yeah
I want one damn it, but they're abit hefty for decent ones.
Are they for surge protection and such?
What is your PSU rated at?
Mine's been pretty good. Had it for a few years
bronze, silver, or gold?
Or none of those things?
morning folks
Vivix: It's for surge protection and if the power shuts off, it has a battery that supplies enough power for you to safely shut your computer down.
I need to get a battery back up
=\
/me licks Jmo
Ah nice, surges and outs are extremely rare where I live, never had one outside of specific situations- but- my current living room/studio is 10A, so sometimes my bass amp blows the fuses, then it would be nice to have one
I think the battery in mine crapped out because it no longer keeps my computers on when the power blinks.
/me pats Panda|Drawing
Time to replace Dema
Yup
I mean the UPS, not Dema.
Whats a Dema/
XD
<.<
Use commas Moojay. :>
Dema is what makes Gold_Demona a Demona
HOW TO COMMA
Panda|Drawing: Dema is a character in one of my comics. Jmo likes is lots. :>
^
So he calls me Dema
:>
:>
Gold_Demona, you has comic?
Yesh. A Nuzlocke comic.
Ish so good ;_;
;p;, You flatter me mojay. XD
Good afternoon :)
Hiyo Colt_Brovakiin
Afternoon Colty
I erased it and I STILL typed it wrong! It's "lol" not ";p;"
:P
I don't even know what ;p; is. XP
Livin the Suite life, Colt?
Ah, was gonna say
It didn't all fit Gold_Demona :P
:D
/me licks Gold_Demona
I love it
You do? =D
Like adam isn't bad enough.
Getting licked ish worth it to get compliments. ^^
it isn't ;_;
?
Gold_Demona, im a littlejelly though. you art so good
My art is good, but there are many better than me. =/
Dema ish best artest.
I can't say my art is bad, but there's certainly better.
Wrek is better than me
His art is awesome
IF we make a mud we should create a bronystate theatre in the world that you can visit. :3
Gold_Demona look... dont compare yourself to others. you have talent..
Also you can get kicked out of by shizu
Hehe
Yeah
I'm currently working on a paintchat replacement, not specificly for here but--you know, so I'm a little too distracted to start on a mud, but I'd love to see one
Gold_Demona, yes Wrek has awesome talent. But you do realize that you are pushing yourself back, right? :/
I can't remember what we used to make muds, or host them, but it's not nearly as hard as making legends of equestria, you just need good descriptions, fun writing, and good missions and adventures
/me pushes Vivix back
What do you mean Panda?
/me falls
woop
And, we can compare ourself to others and realize they are better, without being sad or disappointed
Aye Vivix.
Panda|Drawing: you should link that one image I showed you before, the one about art and whatnot
I'm not sad about it. Just being humble.
Yeah, it's a healthy view as an artist
Sylandest XD Gold_Demona sounds like me, no?
convincing ourselves we are the best at what we do is worse
Panda|Drawing: just a tad
Of course I work to get better at my craft. That's how I got as good as I am to begin with. :P
Vivix, yup.
mmhmm
Yeah, we strive, and striving is part of the fun
btw.... Gold_Demona, I love that ham ham OC <3
As for my Nuzlocke comic, it's more of a side thing that I don't really put my full artistic effort into so I have something my art skill can do without getting frustrated.
Thanks, Panda. ^^
And then I realized I was talking to a lady.
xD
._.
Bahaha XD
Ello state of the bronies

My cats wake me up. Frequently
^
boredom wakes me up... but it also puts me to sleep
hm...
Last night my father in-law woke me up by calling my phone when we were almost asleep. ?_?
XD
They tend to do that... at least they didnt call while "in the moment" nothing kills a mood like a virbrating phone XD
LOL True. XD
Ugh, internet derp
We tend to ignore the phones when that happens though. Not that it happens often
/me shrugs
Wait what
The conversation went to sex while I was gone for 5 seconds?
I was on call at work, so I had to keep my phone on vibrate XD bad move.
XD
lol
hm?
Whoops sorry Hoody|School, I was just cracking a joke.
You married too, Panda? I'm beginning to think I'm the only married person in all of Bronystate. XP
LOL
Everyone else is either single or underage. :P
Gold_Demona: no, but he does have a lovely lady he absolutely adores
Gold_Demona alas, I was almost married... but thats a story for another day. I am with someone though.
LMFAOOTFRALOL

Panda did you see my Companion Cube?
How did I get here?
Gold_Demona YES D: I want!!!!
I use http://www.ctrlpaint.com/ for my lessons
My very first crochet project. :3
how the hell did you do that though Demi? if I can call you that.
Barbetos|AtWork: I draw stuff with a pencil
Panda I am working towards being able to draw ponies cuase I want to starta tumblr, and work on the anima project for TTEoAP
TTEaAP? whats that?
among other things
Through The Eyes of Another Pony
Its an awesome Fan Fic
So awesome in fact that it now has a team of people working on animating it
Panda: Crochet. That's how. :3
They need story boarders and animators though
Wrek has done some art for the fic too
Isn't the story already written?
Written, but not complete
did anyone manage to watch that fan episode "Dusk Dawn"?
Gold_Demona oh gosh XD but i crochet, but nothing ever looks like that
He has about 15 chapters of 24 or something like that
Dken2021: no
I was not even aware of it
Fan episode?
Wut?
well....don't, trust me
I wish I had artistic talent ;_;
did you fill it with cotton Gold_Demona?
Hoody|Skool EVERYONE CAN HAVE TALENT!
:3
All I can do is dance
Thats an artistic talent Hoody|Skool....
But I don't like to dance...
Panda: I made the base sides as a base. Embroidered the pink lines into it. Then I made the edges and corners separately and sewed them on. The corners, circles, and hearts were made with the circle-type technique, and I sewed the hearts into the circles and sewed everything into place.
Hoody|Skool well i can tell you now. talent is earned, not given.
Panda: I filled the cube with polyfoam I cut into squares and sewed it shut. :)
Panda: You are mistaking talent for skill
^
Talent you are born with. It's SKILL you earn
talent is an aptidue or learning ability
thats the technical term
Gold_Demona.... I am jealous! and I always match them as one in the same. Just some are more predisposed to it...
and everyone can earn skill, talent or not- basically, but it takes will and desire
shit gotta go
latas
seeya Hoody
But they're not the same...
Weird kid >.>
Hehe
You can have talent and no skill, and vice versa
Most people have a calling that they persue, and others are born to do what they do.
yeah
pursue*
You can learn a skill and still suck at it
I don't have a talent for art, but I've learned enouh to have fun
Gold_Demona, hm... I see what you mean hun. My mistake ^^;
Yeah like Vivix knows how to make music but still sucks

Hey there, dari :P

Yeah. I'ma get it

LOL
DayZ is so buggy-
thanks to Arma
It is near unplayable
imo
well they are making it a standalone game at the end of this year
It does have moments where it's so wrong that it's--ridiculous
Isn't that WarZ?
Yeah that's the end of the year.
no
Two different games.
Ahkai
Oh shit
The website is being blown the f up
Either way WarZ looks playable and not in that engine
lolwut?
dayZ is amazing if you can run it anyone here got a zombie plan
War Z uses the Cry egine I think
no, zombies don't exist
DayZ I could run even on my old, old computer
if they did lol
Well, even if, I'd have no plan
OH
IT'S YOU
ALIENWARE KID
HAHAHAHA
i am in the british army and i know they ahve a plan just in case
Well, I don't really care about that
^
Either a lot of people are trying to get war z right now, OR the websit has been a victim of a DDoS
D:
whats war z like
Well it is 15th for the WarZ people soon- so it might be overloaded
Well Alpha release is soon.
Oh there we go

You are right!

Give it to me!!
._.
/me slaps herself
Awkward even for me
Can tell what you're into.
Ehem
I am going to have a discussion with brain for a moment
Twilight getting staples in her frog? Check
Howdy y'all!
/me waves to Everlasting_Joy
Well. Brain is no longer speaking to me.
Howdy Panda|Drawing!
Here comes the insanity.
Hai Everlasting_Joy
Barbetos|AtWork: I see I'm not the only one.
Howdy Colt_Brovakiin!
I need to shave, I feel like a hermit
howdy Everlasting_Joy :)
ew shaving
your mother shaves Jmo
It listed a few reasons. 1. you made a hastey purchase for a game you probably will hate. 2. you called me dum, you call the shots bro. 3. ????
/me suddenly imagines Jmo with massive communist beard
OHHH
It just kind of got fuzzy after that
OHHHHH
Oh yeah I'm growing my beard for sure.
Howdy Sylandest!
/me huggles Everlasting_Joy
Sometimes I think my brain is actually a woman.
LOL
It berates me like one.
/me hugs Sylandest back :).
Thats okay. Sexy internal voice is worth all the pain.
And oh so many mental images
I tried going a beard once, but part if my face won't grow right >.<
Barbetos|AtWork: Mine feels like a fog. It's there, you know it is, but you can't really feel it and can't see through it completely.
Everlasting_Joy: my throat is sore :(
*of
Sylandest ahem~
Sylandest: :(, do you think you're getting sick?
Everlasting_Joy no he isnt sick~
I get random beards everynow and then, just really hate my shaving equipment
Maybe I should get a MASSIVE moustache
And some of you think I am narcissistic now. You would not be too far off in that assumption really.
>.>
What can I say. I am one sexy mother fucker.
Grow dat sexy beard for meh.
Hehe
Barbetos|AtWork: Well played. . .
Everlasting_Joy: I'm hoping to fight off whatever it is. I took medicine to help, but its not entirely agreeing with me.
Jmo: I actually am growing my beard out
I can show you.
PICS OR NEVER HAPPENED
Stream!
http://pub.tv2.no/multimedia/TV2/archive/00679/AriBehn-1024_679956i.jpg THIS guy has a good beard

Vivix I can grow a beard like that
Vivix eh, 6/10

chemistry/10
THIS is a beard.
http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/374436_3872274049728_207020122_n.jpg
Everlasting_Joy: speaking sucks...hell, trying to drink anything sucks atm XD
Hehehe
Jmo: dat beard.
Jmo agreed
Sylandest: Which is why I said I'll take just about anything over sore throats :(.
:P
Maybe I should grow it out that long, and start scaring people
Scaring people, psshtt.
I'd say "falcon punch" but that would have blown the whoel building to smitherines.
Everlasting_Joy: I'll be fine, hehe. I'm just feeling blegh today. It happens around this time of night/day...or something
Or well, it would make me look authorative
or like an old fisherman
I was half expecting that prison to explode just because a cool guy was walking away from it calmly
bye bye everypony i have to go to school now
Sylandest: Still, doesn't mean it doesn't suck.
Baibai

Damnit.

Um, yeah it does
Nueve = Nine
Gold_Demona: I know nueve is nine in Spanish, but I couldn't help but play up the idea of he said "When something starts at nine, it starts at nueve." Since from an absolute stand point the word nine and nueve are not the same spelling.
cant hear anything
Ah
I see :P
I decided to exploit it for a cheap joke.
thanks
oh hey, the ipad drop?
Wow
ASoftFluffyThing: where can i find this so called chat topic?

08,01so i got to hang out with the creator of MySQL today
08,01he's a really cool chap
What's MySQL.
08,01Meanwhile: an open source database program
08,01used by abotu 15 million people
08,01or rather, with 15 million users
Sounds...incredibly dull.
pro
Dramatic music can make you shoot good.
hey
08,01Meanwhile: it wasn't dull!
Yeah I can't play with music going either, I get distracted.
08,01he gave me some great advice about how to effectively sell software while keeping it open source
08,01using dual licencing
You would be surprised the amount of people you meet from just knowing things and being in general rather tactful,
08,01aye
08,01Meanwhile: well, it's exciting to someone who writes software
^ don't do this
=P
Hehe, I'm sure you had fun.
Awesome

Oooooooooh.
Extreme close ups!
:O

Holla everypony! :)

Hi BronyInstrumental
>beating up frozen people
Wrek: Nice!
Lovely weather Wrek.
Guards waiting with guards
Better snow then rain...
than*
So why are the guards just hunting them down?
Because they have powers
SpadeMagnes[School]: theyre terrorists
And are considered terrorists
And do they have any evidence of said terrorism?
hiro, dont hog the whole goddamn elevator
Why would they need it?
Wrek Lucky!!!
so it's like x men in this time line then
They oppose the current government
And are therefore terrorists
Above you?
hiro y u no freeze time
doesnt that make them just discentors?
WHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST
He can't
BETRAYEL
Saw that coming.
His powers are being blocked by the Haitian
Poor black dude
^
Like, if there was anything that was obvious about this episode, that was it.
oh hurdur right
Nope, Haitian
yeah
and black guy is first to die :D
00,10Hi spock
What is it with black people always dieing first in movies?
Deathu gurippu spocku.

So why would he need any other power than that?
lol
Sumerpan!
I must go, my planet needs me.
what a twist
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
:O

If they knew he were Sylar
They'd all be after him
Some guy said to say hi to you when you wake up.

That's gonna be fun.
FLAME ON
welcome back Meanwhile
YATTA!
Hey hold up if Sylar in the future now has access to Hiro's future corpse...
Chat is silent....
Whats with the comic?
The comic was drawn by the guy who paints the future.
but maybe the future never happened
Hiro is so adorable
The comic is basically part of his foretelling.
agh time travel, it never makes any sense
So its mobile plot
Anyone up for minecraft?
HIYA everypony
Hi Bronysith
hi Bronysith
Hey Bronysith
Hi, Bronysith. :)
We're nearing the end, oh boy.

But....
save the last 1, because ill miss it if you stream it now..
I was playing around in Black 2 and I actually found a evee
SpadeMagnes[School]: Nice.
Is that a european thing? Where you call it "series" instead of "seasons"?
nice SpadeMagnes[School]
i have time for 1 more thankfully
Gold_Demona: Apparently.
Gold_Demona: Not really. You can have multiple seasons in a series.
Do we?
I thought so.
I don't. :S
Cuz there are 23 episodes in the first season of Heroes
Oh AJIsAwesome, it was Docto.
Okay.
Doctor Who? Where?
Nowhere :<
Aww :<
I am disappoint
But the UK English is to say 'series'
I getcha
You mean the correct English.
Meanwhile: Well, yeah.
they say "season" in russian too
/me sings "THE MORE YOU KNOW!!~~~
Hah
Gold_Demona: ding!
I speak wrong English. :P
there is no right or wrong english.
Well, there is.
Gold_Demona: I speak Yorkshish, so I've no hope to start with. :D
05i speak gibberish
So adorkable

Aww
Would be wrong English.
I bet New York is totally reassured by that.
I love Hiro
"Yeah thanks random asian man, I feel much safer."

Ahahahahahaaa, Barbetos|AtWork
Barbetos|AtWork: :D
And now Sylar knows the future too.
I was going to wait for the right time to share this one, but is it too good to wait for it. http://i.imgur.com/chnxJ.gif
kinda dead here, bro
You know, if you hadn't killed him Sylar I'm sure he would tell you.
Barbetos|AtWork: That's amazing. :D
Sylar is a monumental moron.
Barbetos|AtWork: That's frickin' hilarious. :D

In other news, I can not watch Football, I have to play it

Pft. Sisters.
You want what I have.......the Krabby Patty formula.
Plankton.
I wonder if anyone will notice
AJIsAwesome: ill be visiting you tonight
That this is the kid who Parkman found?
twilight_sprinkle: ........
Yep.
But will anyone notice something else.
Dabi, I still don't know why kids love cinnamon toast crunch so much
Is it too late to notice what we were trying to notice?
Because I didn't notice.
Well if no one has noticed by now, they're not likely too.
Oh. I see it. Its a stream on bronystate right?
What was it?
i only saw some pics on a monitor
Can't tell you
Spoilers.
Damnit.
i thought it looked like the transforming girl
but i coldnt tell who else was on it
Sylar has super hearing
Lul
heres JOHNNY
what we watchin?
Heroes
Whoa it's Spock!
lul
He was Sylar before he was Spock :D
why didnt htey kill him
Also why is Spock wearing a helmet?
Spock.
he shouldve just killed him
so spock was superpowered serial killer before he joined starfleet
oh wait nvm
He's...I'm not sure, he can regenerate to a degree but he can't be invulnerable yet.
yes he isnt invulnerable yet because he only got claire in the future
The boogeyman.
oooooh...she's the tracker.
'click'
She's called Molly Walker
Dat realization
The Walker System.
Bennet, Parkman, and Ted are going to destroy the Walker system.
Yeah I wonder how that'll go when they realise it's a 10 year old.

GriffonCherry|Maid: Im just so bored :$
So he has multiple powers?
i didn tknow he could freeze stuff
he's the human snow machine
also bitch, you dumb
His prime power is to understand how things work.
Ah.
TheMonstaMuffin: Wait a sec...
He's able to use that in some manner to assimilate the powers of dead folks.
GriffonCherry|Maid: Sure :)
Okay.
Thanks.
Meanwhile: i think its because he looks at their brain or examines their bodies in some way
Np.
senteced to death by snowglobe
means he can learn powers ´by taking their owner's brains apart
its odd he looks at a dead brain though, id think he would need analyza the dna or a working brain, but eh
Saresh got a gold star. :D
I'm sure it's going to be a cheery conversation when Parkman and Ted find her.
Are they dead though?
...
Wait what?

p4ngya: dayum
Is your computer made out of bread?
Meanwhile: pretty much

but i can play sc2 fine
What, components get hot. >:
yay Dari is back
Vids back dari, you can keep playing.
bad game fps=/= bad computer though
Lul
It does if the fps is supposed to be good though
He's so sad.
Quick, kill him with his mother in the next room.
>insane serial killer
>oh well, he deserves another chance
Gold_Demona: ps2 seems to be a heavy game though
True
Sylar wants his mommy. :<
damnit mom
DAYUUUUMMMMMMM
Woah...that's harsh.
disowned
oh shut up bitch, you raised him this way
Welp.

She'll shut up now. =/
Hum...
Welp
aaaaand mom is dead
Nice going.
See Hiro
Should have stepped in earlier
well shes ded
Decapitation?
Oh dear.
tough day for sylar
So he basically enters another state of mind?
When he uses his powers?
AJIsAwesome: no hes always this way
Well if he wasn't totally gone in the head beforehand he definitely is now.
Ouch
twilight_sprinkle: Oh, okay.
Thanks.
So his dad hated him because he was born too late
Well, maybe not hated him
But he was cold.
hiro really shouldve hurried up with the kil
That's real nice.
WOw. Clean break
a gun!
A ROCK?!
Hai Guys!
Hayo
Hi, Chrysalis. :)
how are things Chrysalis
How are people this evening
Pretty good.
alexxm been better, public transport is abysmal
i left work 2 hours ago
oh good, heros
These people have way too many hang-ups about stopping the huge explosion.
Evil bitch
Wants the huge explosion to happen
I don' wanna kill Sylar it's against Bushido.
What's her power? I don't remember if they ever showed it
I don' wanna shoot you you're my uncle.
She dreams the future
shits getting messy
..that came out wrong
I DO BELIEVE!
So they want to have the bomb go off and kill millions so...they can have a puppet president?
can you be batman!
Something like that Meanwhile
Lawl
this show is full of moms of the year
Is that seriously all they want?
He drew a picture in her blood.
Meanwhile: I'm not entirely sure to be honest
dude thats creepy
well he's broken
>implying he wasn't alread
They said I could be anything I want, so I became a bomb.
already*
I hope that's not all because that is terribly unbelievable motivation.
why not, they could control the country
the cheerleader character is the most pointless to me in this show
They have enough power and connections to do that through bribery anyway.
So they are trying to take over to control it
Or something like that
I don't really remember.
dont think bribery would help that much, they dont seem to be excessively rich
Oh this was a good idea.
their security sucks
wow gg
Oh god damnit.
Oh shit, he's heating up
And then everypony came.
NEXT
shit about to be on fire yo
CLIFFANGET
seems stuff for him got a bit ... Hot YARRRRRRRRRR

You know what? It's official. Planetside 2 is the FIRST game that this laptop is OFFICIALLY unable to run among the games I've tried to run.

Ohai

Needs less caps and needs more soap.

^
MadSurge and then she puts on the mask and nothing happens

Dken2021: she just gets slightly more powerful :D
i DUNNO
/me goes back to hidy hole

Pinkie + mask?
thats a scary thought
shed have...
GREEN HAIR
Was that Golden Harvest or Carrot Top that said "Well, I never"?
/me slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout
i dno u tel me
ayejay
I hear it's Carrot Top, but some people say it's Golden Harvest.
either or
tomato, tomato
>_>
Genius.
Golden Harvest is the official name for Carrot Top, so it's Golden 'Carrot Top' Harvest
Liar.
Wikia saaid sooo
Vivix: Okay. Thanks. :)
Johnny nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
You believe everything on wikia?
does that mean that derpy can be ditzy doo as well?
Not sure.
Noo ;__; but I'm a big Carrot Top fan for some reason
Psht
depends, if you want to, you can bend any canon as long as there's no constricting evidence
Now it's just sad to keep watching this game on the stream knowing that I can't play it.
Play it on a toaster.
oi DWR
Joomay, my GPU is a few models below the minimum requirements. And its crashing on an error message saying that it can't find my GPU
ATI or Nvidia
Anone wanna pizza pie?
meme denied
Joomay, ATI
fffff
Model number
TEAM SPECTATE!
Well, series I should say.
4250
Ahahaha
You poor bloke.
Running AMD CPU I'm guessing?
What are you trying to play?
Joomay, eeyup
PS2
/me hugs Kandarihu
PS2 EM?
There there.
Planetside 2 you dummy >.>
Ooh
<,<
/me slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
You deserve that one.
:3
Wut u want Joomay?
Well, yes
Well, being able to run a Playstation 2 EMU on it would be great too.
You cleaned your room yet?
Most of it.
Egh, slacker.
My brother hasn't turned up in the past 2 days
So no point until he actually does.
Well for anyone who wants i got a free beta key still so if you want it and am sure you can run the game i'll give it
I don't blame him. Who'd wanna live with you. :>
All there is to do is move some stuff on the bed and I need to vacuum.
And oi.
I'm a good roomie
05Joomay: behave
Ahahahahaha
Kandarihu you can if you have enough grunt
Love you too chav.
just don't use/take my stuff and all will be good
:3
<3
ohai Wrek
I wonder how'd a Aussie/British roomie scenario roll
Easy
Tea and Fosters everywhere
Eggs in a crisp bag and shrimp everywhere
Rofl
Chrysalis, I KNOW grunt. I'm perfectly used to framerates of 15 for anything I play. This isn't a matter of this game looking less pretty than what Wrek's awesome rig gets. THis is a matter of the game being being below Minimum.
I'll bring my spiders with me. K?
...and because of that, it doesn't start
http://i.imgur.com/AmYY7.png "I'm meeeltiiiiing"
Yeah, when below minimum, only option is to respec
with todays computers though, that is often not too heavy on the wallet, thanks to consoles
Lul
so I've just met some nice jehovah witnesses, they announced that they were jehovah witnesses before I opened the door, what nice people
Depends on what you want
Jmo! Steam broke
I'm still on
True, but if you just want to run it, it's not too expensive
MadSurge: :D
Vivix, I can't upgrade the GPU on this computer, because it's a laptop.
Ooh, I forget laptops exist fairly often-
Rofl laptop
First mistake right there >.>
despite having one
hehe
Pretty much- even gaming laptops aren't very good for gaming- you'd save money by buying a medium/av stationary
Oi DWR, can I be your roomie?
lolno
Single bed
awwww
...
Actually
yes.
>:3
11,02My laptop is pretty powerful D:
wut..?
NewSuperBronyU needs nerf
What the hell are you planning
Dat NewSuperBronyU :3
Nothing~
Power laptops exist, but it's cheaper to buy a stationary, in the long run at least
Bollocks, you are planning.
11,02I think an Intel Core i7 and GeForce 660 M GTX is perfect enough for gaming :D
Needs nerf
pronto
That would of been a nasty price tag
SB64 'M' model?
need more power
11,02Price tag for it was $1200
SSD?
I've got i7 2600 670GTX 16gb ram on around..1200 dollars spread out over one and a half year
11,02HDD
11,021 TB though :D
6/8GB RAM?
11,028 GB
1tb here too
How big is the screen
11,0215.4" 1080p
Oh gosh i suck at drawing on the computer..
egh 15.4"
Would drive me nuts
What brand?
11,02Lenovo
11,02IdeaPad
I really need to build a new PC...
hm- never heard of, but sounds good
That ain't bad for that price tag
Lenovo... Chinese, I think.
11,02ikr
China = good now adays
depending on the tier
compared to THAT brand in the corner.
SB64 needs more desktop less laptop
11,02Plus it has a Blu-Ray Burner and Reader :3
i have a Qaude core 4gb and GTS450 Nvidea 2 gb and 1tb hdd
^
Chrysalis: Agreed.
11,02I don't like desktop computer really...
y? :<
Chrysalis: get into planetside2 naaaaaaow
11,02computers*
They're fun to play with.
I prefer them since I don't have to upgrade very often
Next PC I'm getting is a desktop.
NewSuperBronyU You like to be on the move?
Bronysith people on?
I upgrade about once every 5 years or somethiing
Expecially when you overclock them and install liquid cooling. TEEHEE
Chrysalis: me Wrek Sumica and others yes
11,02They're fun to build, but I'd rather have peace of mind by buying a computer built together already.
I really need to upgrade my harddrive. :D
Slacker >.>
11,02:<
I like having things not prebuilt, since if something breaks I can replace it on my own for less money
But NewSuperBronyU, building computers is fun
Bronysith coming on now and gettin skype going
Chrysalis: okay are you ikn the planetside 2 voice group?
Would you have more piece of mind by building it yourself and knowing how it's been set up?
11,02Indeed, but after spending $1000+ on one and then getting issues, having to troubleshoot where the problem lies and then having to possibly replace a specific part isn't much fun.
Pfft
That is fun, whatchu on abuot.
about*
whoah wtf
Hehe
damn this map looks big
5 missed calls on skype?
people really wanted to talk to me on the 5th
I burnt out my northbridge or something on my previous computer, never fouond out quite what was wrong
Chrysalis It's a weird glitch.
/me plans on building a computer in the next one to three years
11,02Besides Consoles are better than PCs for gaming :P
but starting that computer was like reving a car, restart until it started
Pushh
Oh god
Says that you missed calls from users even though they never done them
Consoles are too--old
^
/me wants to also make a gaming PC on his own
Just
That lowered my IQ reading that ;_;
I also save money on not having consoles, since I don't play that much-
its bad but its the first thing ive tried to draw on my computer, any tips, btw not finished
Games on console are slacking. I'm sure NewSuperBronyU keeps his Nintendo products for exclusives, just like I do for my xbox
11,02If you want a few more shadows in your games go with PC, otherwise, I'll stick with consoles :)
oGriofa: It's nice. I like it. :)
Did he actually just say consoles... nah, I'm just hallucinating. XD
<_<
It's not that- I just don't like gamepads
11,02You need gamepads for certain games.
^
Yeah, but the only one in mylibrary is GTASA
AJIsAwesome: I tried to keep the style i use when i draw on paper. i use ink pen.
and I don't play that anymore
11,02Super Meat Boy is one of them >>
Or if you're just used to controllers, you can just hook it up to the PC
how i feel today
I don't like those kinda games either- so for me PC is only way, since I don't play that much, and prefer keyboard-
https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/8/30/_qQwC0edxUSqzYpg_eJRNA2.jpg
PC's *can* fit controllers, you know?
Wat is USB
Even joysticks, if they're used nowadays.
11,02HOWEVER, I do enjoy what my laptop can do for playing games and possibly even getting a game that's significantly cheaper on PC than the console version.
Egh
PC is master race. Nothing will change that
For me, pc is best, for my uses
hello
11,02If there's one game I can't deny at all being better on PC than Consoles is Minecraft.
11,02Hey Cameh_Dude :)
modular, workstation, with games on the side
I've always used consoles, but I'm waning towards PCs now
oGriofa: What program did you use?
11,02Joomay: For certain things, not always.
Psht
whats the server name?
What's something consoles can do better?
Frat boys.
AJIsAwesoome: Corel Sketch Pad, its the only thing that works right now because i dont have a tablet, i may buy one soon
Not gonna stab you, just curious.
11,02If you like PCs better than Consoles, that's one thing, but there really is no 'pure' choice of gaming hardware. They all play differently, have different games and community features.
No tablet? Pretty nice oGriofa
I'm netural for both.
Vivix: Im using my finger now, my comp is touch screen
Aah
oGriofa: Okay. I'm considering becoming an artist, but only when I have enough time and the right tools.
Pen and paper
easy to acquire
Still, I'd like to see things that console are more superior in.
Pencil and paper is the best starting point you could ever have
11,02Joomay: First, Nintendo makes consoles better. They don't develop on anything else. Second, the different controls are more innovative on consoles (i.e. Wii U GamePad, Xbox Kinect, PlayStation Move).
just look at ecmajor *fanboygasm*
AJIsAwesome: When i get my tablet i might just keep using corel sketch pad, i like the styles i can use, but i cant find opaque colors :P
How is Nintendo making consoles superior to computers o.o
Okay. Thanks, DashWithRainbows and Vivix. :)
Nintendo is evil.
wat
11,02Because Nintendo makes some of the best games in the industry.
The controls, easily ported to computer.
I'm obligated to mention that whenever they come up so you know, just carry on.
Gaming industry?
While innovative controls are fun, I don't like innovation like kinect, move, or mirror game, or holograms-
11,02You can hack your way around it, but it's never as plug and play as a console.
Still, able to be done.
Hey, NewSuperBronyU, what would you say if I snapped the top half of my DS on purpose?
11,02Probably the one thing I hate about PCs is certain games don't include matchmaking online. They just give you a list of servers to select from with their own special rules and not all of them have players in it.
:O
11,02DashWithRainbows: I don't care...?
Good boy :3
/me licks DashWithRainbows
eewwwww
Only cause that's how the developers made it.
I prefer browser list over matchmaking, but that's again just a preference-
Positive emotions
yuck
And how they see it fit the platform
11,02Joomay: It's how they made it specifically for PC, on consoles, you get matchmaking.
Then again, I usually prefer SP over MP
11,02I can easily jump in a game and start playing online.
on the same game?
Eh
11,02Yes
I've never tried a nintendo port on pc-
So you rather jump into a game at random instead of specific?
11,02Yes
Aight, that's your preference.
I prefer specific- lets me just--have one place to relate to
the dedicated server match thing in Valve games are kinda nice, no need to set up listenserver
^^^
ah those things, but I avoid those with tags
NewSuperBronyU, a game where every server goes by the same rules is fine for matchmaking. But bring in the factor of people wanting to play with their friends or servers with wierd modifications, and you're going to want to be more choosey with your servers.
You can find 'vanilla' servers that are hosted using a dedicated server.
^
The answer would apparently be to...read the server rules before joining it?
^
Oh great, PC master race argument again?
11,02Meanwhile: Sometimes they aren't clear until you join and get kicked.
Sue me dabi.
<.<
Not really an arguement
/me sues Joomay
True, but that's a poorly run server you don't want to be on anyway.
Just discussion.
Just curious.
/me is lost
You kinda get that one server you like
11,02Yeah, consoles will always be better than PCs imo :)
and always go to-
Plus there's usually a quick join function anyway.
Ive been using alot of guides on paper, should i do the same with comp?
http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D-VxzMw4kv0/TeX7AX3TE2I/AAAAAAAAFTA/rHu8S-G-bf8/s1600/130255146209.png
guides?
try studies instead
Lulz
Whatever floats your boat SB
so who would win in a fight jet li or jackie chan
watch a characters movements and get familiar with how they're constructed
Jet Li.
alexxm: Yes. :3
oGriofa whichever one makes you feel comfortable doing
At this point in time, probably Li.
Half Minute Hero uses matchmaking. It limits the options you can choose unless you're the one starting the game.
Chan's robust and smart but he's not exactly spritely.
Jackie chan is indeed good, but did he ever do a commercial for a phone?
Dken2021: YEa i figured that, its just drawing on comp is so different.
it should feel the same, so I suggest a good tablet
Jet Li is 49, Jackie Chan is 58
Not much contest there.
dabi pls
who's streming? and what?
*streaming
chuck norris is in his 70's last i checked
jaymoo pls
Xaiden, not sure who's streaming, but this is Planetside 2
Wrek, and Planetside 2.
Live commentary?
Yep.
cool
I wonder if Wrek would be interested in playing and streaming Phantasy Star Online 2 when it comes out in English.
BNY?
Hey just a quick question then I got to fly: What's the software used to livestream, is it mips.tv?
Yep.
Is it limited to 3 letters?
mips is the stream provider, there's a separate software involved
Some Adobe program
yea that
Hm
05yeah
I think?
11,02Speaking of consoles, the Wii drops in price to $130 effective October 28th :D
Moooneey
NewSuperBronyU: What was its orginal price when it first came out?
yay, too bad I won't be able to afford it yet
NewSuperBronyU: Who said anything about consoles?
We talked about it earlier
or use that internet connection
oh
11,02AJIsAwesome: $599 US Dollars
Xaiden, we were talking about consoles before you came.
NewSuperBronyU: Oh you! :P
Yay, too bad you could invest $130 in ice cream and come away with more enjoyment.
PC vs Consoles
11,02It was actually $250 :)
Okay.
ROFL
Thanks. :)
Hey anyone getting Dead Space 3 or Black Ops 2 for the PS3?
since were talking 'bout consoles
11,02They announced Dead Space 3 already? o.o
>_>
wha? so it's gonna be cheaper than the wii launch price?
Months ago.
Dead Space 3?
Mm, and they gave it co-op.
11,02I'm getting Black Ops II on Wii U ^-^
why are there 3 dead spaces
NewSuperBronyU: Dude, like 3 trailers have came
Because they're done pretending that they're trying to make a horror franchise.
I thouht Dead Space 3 was out
^
oh my Vivix.
11,02Not a fan of Dead Space so I don't know >>
/me didn't want to play it
Well no they haven't given up, watch the Eudora walkthrough on their channel
It isn't out till next year
Ah
Joomay: Wasn't it said to come out in Nov, earlier this year?
The only thing I remember abou DeadSpace, other than the LP I'm watching, is pregnant fluttershy deadspace thing
No
And Black Ops 2 will presumably be the same as Black Ops 1. Which was the same as the one before that which was the same as the one before that...repeat ad infinitum.
February 2013
08,01wheeee
Was announced in June
But still, anyone getting DS3 for the PS3? Looking for co-op partners,
08,01no
O u
08,01i'm trying to figure out if it's possible for a person to do a sonic rainboom
11,02I already have a 3DS :)
How did 3DS come into play o.o
NewSuperBronyU: D: Dead S: Space, 3
NewSuperBronyU: Do you have Kid Icarus: Uprising? :)
Smileys make me feel uneasy ;__;
It was an anagram
11,02AJIsAwesome: Yesh :3
-_-
YAY!
NewSuperBronyU: I have it too. :3
What does the 3DS have to do with anything?
^^^^^
itsajoke.jpg
11,02I also had Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3D Land and a bunch of other games that I had in my game pouch which I lost ;~;
I mean yes we're talking about silly things that shouldn't exist in a proper society but still.
Meanwhile: Exactly, i was refering to Dead Space 3,
LOL
11,02Meanwhile: so srs
Hey, you've got your opinion, I've got mine.

Granted, yours is wrong, but that's irrelevant.
11,02Dinner? It's breakfast tiem D:
11,02:<
hey, random question, Shizuka play Uncharted? Was online a week ago and got teamed up with some of the same exact naem
Hey NewSuperBronyU I can't remember if I asked you this before or not, but you don't have Sakura Wars do you?
11,02but...but...
11,02i liek my opinions ;^;

Huh, funny

I thought the Canadians killed moose.
I saw it about half a year ago, and was godsmacked
Both.
Never saw Bambi either.
Moose wasn't good enough
maybe I should vote for Fox and the Hound
So they moved on.
Huh, the more you know.
The animation--beats anything disney did post the 60s
Fox and the Hound was cute-
Godsmacked? Isn't that a screamo band?
damn cartoons, why u make me feral furry
Maybe, I think it's an expression
blame disney
11,02Bambi confirmed for Season 3?

Oh, you mean gobsmacked.

NO-ONE asked.
Hi Eli
NewSuperBronyU: What games do you play on PS3 when you do happen to stream for that console?
actually, noone did ask <,< it was spurred on by lion king
But as a kid I thouht she was super cute, as an adult, she looks really weird
well implied then
or just sparked up
Who just skpped Aces High?! :[
Grüß Gott Eli :)
Woah wait vordox is banned?

Confusion.
No, wait... that wasn't Aces High...
Meanwhile, yep

Who skipped Two Minutes to Midnight?! :[
Eli gut
Wait, Vordox is banned? How?
Why?
Dem questions.

/me does a typical I don't know pose
Meanwhile, AJIsAwesome: He was putting in false titles in for lottery
Lil_B: Holla! :)
ASoftFluffyThing: AH.
Something like that
Oh. Well that was silly.
Lil_B: we should switch back to english. we're breaking rules here

/me snickers at own joke
Vivix: i see what you did there
Eli I know, the onlöy german thing I do here is the greeting xD
why was he kicked for false movie titles?
AJIsAwesome, perma. First time he got banned was by Shizuka for the entries, then SB banned him earlier this week because he sent an appeal but didn't wait for a response and came back
ASoftFluffyThing: Ok.
Lil_B pff customised greeting
Dken2021, I think it was false movie titles and something else relating to the lottery. Don't remember all of it.
that sucks, I liked Vordox even though he sometimes really wanted to spread his opinions
Hm, well, waiting to hear all of it.
Vordox? I did some game testing for him a while back. :S
oh wait, wasn't he the one doing those nick changes?

Heya BladedWings :)
NewSuperBronyU: Hey what games DO you play when your on the Playstation 3?

Meanwhile: don't. that was the bane of all my WOW life
Funnily enough the quest her head gives you now breaks continuity
Did someone say [Thunderfury, blessed blade of the windseeker]?
^
13i don't see enough dots
OH MEANWHILE WINS.
/me brings out Ashfury
Meanwhile: god damn how i hated that. i played on Defias Brotherhood, and all few days someone brought that up... couldn't sell shit in trade anymor
ROFL
There's a bad point about the Wiimote that it uses batteries to play...I hated that.
Don't be silly, trade isn't for trading.
^
Trade is for when you've levelled past barrens.
Dont forget the Anal [everything]
Hopefully the Wii U Gamepad won't resolve the same battery issue.
God...
Yo keep it PG breh.
Meanwhile: yeah... it's for 14 year olds spamming shit... glad i quit wow
There are some good people in there
Come back to WoW, they've got pandas.
Hai ^.^
Anal [Ability] jokes. Couldn't stop them once they started.
Roll into lava and stuff.
Hi, HavokOC. :)
Jmo: That have been in lore for god forever
I know
Jmo: not even the pandas can bring me back. they sure tempted me though
What about monks bro
Sorry Im sore that people thought they were because of kungfu panda
O_O

ily pondoo
08,01to curry or not to curry?
08,01maybe i'll also pickle
^
curry.
08,01i'll make some python curry
24 inch pythons.
Sounds... interesting.
the hozen are fucking annoying
Do you even lift?
Haven't had curry in a LONG time.
Ew Curry
I don't think I've ever had curry before
Eever?
How do you manage to never have curry?
Dken2021: you missed about 45% of life then
life is curry
dunno, never seems to come up
Try it once in yo life.
No life is pie.
Curry pie.
lel
Jmo: curry pie and we call it a deal?
^
A npc in pandaria is Lun-chi, a blatant reference if I ever saw one
I wouldn't say that it's just like...living in the western hemisphere and never having a chinese takeout.
Na, terrible idea.
Chocolate pie is better.
SpadeMagnes[School] does that npc have some child bearing hips?
I mean has anyone here never had a chinese takeaway?
her title is ,the street fighter.
Jmo: i'm not much of a sweet tooth. i prefer curry
is that even possible Meanwhile
Talk to her and she says Test your might
Go chew on a chili
isn't curry an indian dish?
alexxm: Doesn't look like it.
>_>
R u srs dken
There's a fishing NPC called 'Master Baiter' as well. Nothing sus...
So whats going on :)
Jmo chili isn't curry. though there is a certain chili i would love to be chewing on
Wasn't relating the two.
Originally yes curry is Indian, but most forms of it in the west have almost nothing in common with the original recipes.
Curry is a dish, but also a spice
A quest i found was called, Bros befor hozen
well spice mix I think?
Currymuncha. Wee
It is spice mix
ChimmiCurryChungaCherri
SpadeMagnes[School]: they have many weird refrences if you go look for it
I found a page that was interesting
Chinese curry isn't proper curry... there's something off about it. :S
SpadeMagnes[School]: like "Magnets. how do they work?"
Chinese curry? wut.
How does that work
Never had chinese curry-
Eli magic
it had a bunch of numbers, turns out its a reference to D3's release date
interesting, well I might try it when the chance comes
Vash: it's a miracle
Eli electron spins of atoms all aligned in a particular direction
Vivix: Give it a miss. It's very... meh.
Geeeeeek
I do like some npcs progressivly get annoyed the more you click them
huh, who'da thoguht promiscuous is a definition used in animal psychology
GilDash, aww..akai
Vash: tell that to ICP
jmo i am a physics major
Eli yeah i got the ref
Want a medal?
yes
and a cooklie
Ain't getting one.
Vivix: Go for a nice dopiaza. Indian curries are the best. ^_^
/me hands Vash a medal and a cooky
yay
cookie*
Also fuck Armsmaster Harlan
GilDash! :)
MadSurge: Holla! :)
He is a terrible boss fight
Have you ever been to India GilDash?
Ahahaha
Meanwhile: Nope.
Major boi gone.
Then chances are you have no idea what Indian curry tastes like.
GilDash: to be honest I hate chinese. I can't stand anything with mixed flavours :S
Meanwhile: Probably not, but I'd love to try it.
MadSurge: Funny, Chinsese is one of my least favourite take aways.
GilDash: If you ever go, don't argue with the police, and don't hand out change to homeless kids.
haha
Meanwhile: i have never been to india, but i know what real indian curry tastes like. it's called indian friends
LOl
You know why Armsmaster Harlan is terrible? He has a attack that can pick you up and it goes on for awhile and you get damaged through the entire thing!
Meanwhile: I'm not a *complete* idiot, even if I am Yorkish. Next you'll be telling me not to harp on about immigration... XD
Ahaa Yorkish.
GilDash: then again, I;m very picky :D
GilDash: Oh and don't flip anyone off, they hate that.
But that's the fun part.
Meanwhile: Isn't that common to everyone, everywhere?
GilDash: Yes.
Only those who take things seriously.
Meanwhile: Then it hardly needs saying, doesn't it? :p
:?
Jmo: *:/ :P
GilDash: No but I thought since you lack common sense I should make even the obvious clear. :3
No don't you edit me.
I meant that.
Yes
:3
Jmo: True. I occasionally greet my friends with, "Oi! You cunts!" XD
:P
I refer to my sister as "Jihaad"
That doesn't blow over that well in public.
Gee I wonder why
The butthurt is all around.
Meanwhile: Well, thank you. I shall jot your advice down in my "Top 10: India" book. XD
I don't know anyone with a knickname
whos butthurt Jmo
I call my little brother "gaylord" nothing about it
08,01ah, India
Especially not when I'm trying to find her.
Yo mamma. Shizzam.
Strolling through shop aisles. "Oi, Jihaad!"
08,01i can tell you some great things not to do/say there
Don't resque naked girls
That I remember
Just curious.
No racism intended.
Don't burst into song and dance, they only do that in movies.
08,011. don't yell "DENGU" instead of "YAHTZEE" when in Andrah Pradesh
how come
08,01Dken2021: yeah, try not to get caught up in a bollywood film
08,01they just spontaneously happen
Someone had a camera, a guy started singing, BAM
08,01like a storm, but with dancing
08,01and almost-kissing
Life would be so weird if people spontaniusly burst into song
Weird but magical-
sort of
08,01Vivix: it's a little known fact that bollywood films are all documentaries
SpadeMagnes[School]: ppl should do that more
http://i.imgur.com/yFoUl.jpg
That is true
08,01SpadeMagnes[School]: there's an episode of Buffy to that effect
Meanwhile got it.
Eli but conserding todays music would it be worth it
I would love a episode that mocks that trope
Zoom zoom roboda.
Ahaha
I miss that movie
People just questioning why theres random singing
anyways, shower~!
The best part in that movie was the mosquitos
That bit made no sense at all.
alexxm: uh no... kill me. if anyone starts singing Rihanna next to me i kick them in the balls
Eeexactly
He can talk to mosquitoes...because.
and the mosquitos are all gang members
That film was... interesting?
Yo you best watch yoself on this turf or I'mma give you hepatitis.
That film was the bomb.
Meanwhile: and malaria
That film was really weird when you get down to it.
08,01i started singing Gangnam Style on the bus in Dundee the other day
Meanwhile: thinking about it, they were heavily armed
Meanwhile: Only really weird?
08,01everyone got up and started dancing
08,01it was magical
Apperently my Black2/White2 guide book has two volumes
08,01okay... that didn't *actually* happen
The first volume is the walktrough
Dundee?
Apparently Hyneas aren't canines
Did they all just look at you..like.."?"
The entire 2nd one is the national pokedex and stuff for like tournaments alone
08,01Dundee is life's hardest game
we should organize some Gangam flashmobs all around the world
Tours of Dundee, on the left you'll see Dundee town hall, on the right you'll see a woman being burnt at the stake.
08,01Eli: first one will be at your house
08,01okay, let's all go to Eli's house
08,01Eli: do you live with you mum?
Rofl
08,01dibs on her.
/me 08,01runs
00,10um, wrek when they are on fire like that they burn to the ground
At least you're honest. :x
08,01Eli: is she deformed?
08,01and does it run in the family?
Yo mamma is deformed yo.
08,01my god, why am i so nasty today?
Yo mamma look like the elephant man.
it's nasty day.
LOl
08,01i'm so sorry Eli, i'm in a silly mood
Who pissed in your cornflakes?
Eli the Last Brony Meetup I went too... Gangnam Style... everyxone, everyhwere, all the time...
Oh my
00,10capture every thing around the base and lock them out of supplys
Yo momma so ugly the elephant man look at her and he be all "naaaah"
08,01AJIsAwesome: i'm lovely!
osnap.
08,01fair enough
Lil_B: you went to a brony meet up?
Enough half assed attempts to convey gang accent through text.
I once saw Yo Mama on MTV
It hurt my everything
Poor diddums.
;_;
Eli yeah, Franfurt am Main have been there 2 times now
Oh MTV when you used to show music
Oh the good old days
before MTV became TV
MTV showed music. Once upon a time.
Vivix: well yo mama went past my tv to get something. i missed five episodes of mlp
loltv
So the legends say
LONG AGO IN A DISTANT LAND.
Oooh Snaaap Eli
08,01yo mama so classy, she turned up to a LAN party in a ball gown
Eli I even know that Last time, there was a Swiss Brony Group who traveled there for the Frankfurt Meetup :)
I, Aku, the shapeshifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil.
08,01am i doing this right?
Hehehe
Yeah you sure are.
"YO mama so fine."
No punchline
Lil_B: i hate and envy you sooooo much right now
But a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me.
/me 08,01once held a formal LAN party, for realsies
08,01*formal dress
08,01yo mama was there
Eli <3 you too :3
I'd love to turn up to a LAN party in a tuxedo
I went to a Lan once, everyone watched movies and porn
08,01the ball gown didn't stay on very long.
Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law, and MTV doesn't actually play music.
Meanwhile: you monster
Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Jersey Shore.
You were the producer of Jersey Shore weren't you?
i never had a lanparty or anything like that
Mean W Hile
Meanwhile: :D
The W stands for honesty.
liar!
sad fact: i don't even really have friends in switzerland :)
08,01GilDash: it was!
me nether... I know there are Lan Partys here, but I can't find them :/ the only one I foudn Onlkine was for from 2002 >.<

/me 08,01steals ASoftFluffyThing and feeds her cake
there was once another Perth person here.
Xaiden: im half british too and a quarter of italian

SpadeMagnes[School]: time for some 8bit smiles
Thing is I was born in the US, lived there for 3 years, went back to Ireland for 10, then now I'm back in the US and have been here for 2
Jmo found him and ate him

LOL
L2AdBlock
Learn to adblock.
Ninja'd
fluttershyftw15, <,<..yeah..this site kinda has that
fluttershyftw15, AdBlock Plus is your friend
11,02Xaiden: I rarely play the PS3 lately but I do play Uncharted 3 online and some Motorstorm :)
Didnt Peta use to dump blood on people?
i love fluffolocation too ;;
adblock is only blocking bronystate and writing.com to m
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350317517377.png
You wrote a half assed version jaymoo, you don't count.
Aw.
Fine.
why would you adblock porn? seriously guys.
Cuz its bad porn :(
NewSuperBronyU: Bro, Uncharted 3 is my life. We should play sometime
Cause I don't admire it.
Because seriously, not everyone wants to see that.
Why does Handsome Jack's face there remind me of Repo!
Because some of us don't like porn? :S
Eli, because you don't want that stuff showing up when you're trying to watch something else
It's as simple as that.
ASoftFluffyThing: true that
Eli yep
/me drinkin coke
Has PETA ever done anything good for the rest of the world, besides look like a bunch of assholes?
/me rolls around fluffy
oopa
GilDash: I hate not having borderlands 2 in the sense that i have no idea what your talking about
:\
SpadeMagnes[School], none that I know of.
Yeah they stopped Vivix from beating up ponies.
Xaiden: I don't actually own it either.
Go PETA.
<,<
I don't beaat ponies..I..something
Xaiden: In fact, I've never played it. :(
Oh god keep it to yourself.
SpadeMagnes[School]: Probably. But after so much of the crap that they have done good luck finding it.
11,02Xaiden: Yeah :D PM me your PSN ID and I'll add you as a friend :)
Vivix, describe this "something"
GilDash: Oh, well that makes 2 of us
05most lately up here
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350320527033.gif
05PETA cut open some salmon farms nets
05casuing hundreds of salmons to die from starvation
I want a Team PETA shirt.
Idiots
/me *BLEALCH*
Pfft.
ASoftFluffyThing, <,<..no
Trout is better.
PETA=exact embodiement of dumbass
Fluffy, you don't wanna know.
Vivix: yeah :| that's why it's silly that they criticized Pokemon when the current villains are an animal "wrong" group
SRSLY
Bronysith: Daww <3
Congrats, you successfully managed to save salmon from being eaten, and got them starved instead.
Didnt they dump buckets of blood on people at one point?
/me doesn't ask anymore
Vivix is nasty.
Leave it at that.
:3
11,02PETA: The organization that loves every species other than their own.
Yeah, pretty much Eli
They also use nuidty and celebrities to promote their cause, which in turn kinda hurts it
PETA
loving species
The people for extorsion, terrorism and arson.
Why would someon stop buying fur because naked woman?
that's a lie and you know it
yeah- do local work, help out
I can sympathise with hating people, people by and large are terrible, but PETA has this incredible ability to not see the results of their actions.
What other stupid shit has peta done
NewSuperBronyU: i'm not opposed to hating humans. we really are the bane of this poor planet. but yeah, nature has survived worse
i want stream ><
:<
they see the results
they just dont care
I want world peace.
See me getting it?
05pro tip, never take the lethal injection
05take a big nail to the frontal lobe
Jmo: same here
05best way to die
loljks
It's fanatasism. That will always be the most dangerous aspect of man.
Jmo: an animal refuge, you get what I mean :D
Surely the pro-tip would be don't get caught.
Yeah but this Vivix.
Or commit crimes somewhere that they don't practice the death penalty.
Or...you know, just not commit crimes.
Don't wanna know yur love.
your*
Peta's games are utter bullshit
;__;
PETA games are GOTY.
me too Vivix, me too
SpadeMagnes[School]: and they're easy to troll :D
dang it, are we talking about peta now?
Yeah, some things just have to happen
NewSuperBronyU, very good point
05being omnivores
What we should ensure is ethical treatment
05we arent supposed to be vegan
NewSuperBronyU: that something completely else
and that does not meen stop providing meat to meat eating us
05heck vegitarian is pushign it
PETA= DUMBFUCKS
meat to meat
they kill them
SpadeMagnes[School]: Most of them are euthanised.
literally
they just killem dead
How is that saving them
No idea
It's not.
So much hate, PETA is cool.
because they aren't being abused
05anotehr thing
SO...killing them is the next best option?
It's also how they have a biased uneducated opinion on animal psychology that makes them make bad decisions
Killing rats isn't cool.
05well fun fact, 3 of their chairman wouldnt be alive today without that research
Eli news flash
I'm not.
it's true
05they are diabetic adn insulin comes from animal research
I'm a muffin.
11,02Because we should be using sticks and rocks for testing out miracle drugs that can cure deadly diseases.
05so hah
hell, i even fling my filth on the trains
Without animal research medical practice would be years behind.
NewSuperBronyU: i don't know... all the anti peta arguments up here start to sound like the PETA arguments themselfes. can we just stop?
^wtf
/me eats Jmo
Noooooo.
Don't eat me yo, not cool.
http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350289024163.png
But you're a delicious muffin though
yes, medecine, food, important things
O U.
you don't want me to go get Derpy
do you?
Oh please get Derpy.

What the hell do vegans even eat?
If you overstate PeTA, you can say that having a pet is kidnapping
dust.
Sand
Fucking grass pulp, I don't know.
Im pretty sure humans need meat to survive
They don't, realistically.
05SpadeMagnes[School] not really
we need protein
True, we don't, but it's one way of survival
But if you off nothing but water and nuts you eventually resemble a twig.
and meat has a lot of protein
05but its a way better source for certain vitamisn etc than the bean counterpart
you live off*
SpadeMagnes[School]: we don't need it. but you would have to take tons of other shit to replace teh nutriments
bugs and other plant types can give us enoguh protein
05which you would need to consume in shitloads anyways
11,02Eli: Kind of tough to just stop a discussion when it doesn't go against the rules and hasn't really gone into a flame war or anything.
So what stuff besides meat has enough protien so you can live?
Sand
A lot of nuts.
The only things we should stop in meat industry is cruel and painful upbringing or methods
05beans, nuts
So yeah, vegans eat nuts.
we're doing pretty good there
lol sand
Make of that what you will.
11,02Nuts have a lot of protein.
We shall live off sand for life.
It has everything we need
Sand and Snow
NewSuperBronyU: yeah... i see that. i have nothing against a friendly discussion, but what we're doing now i a pointles rant against peta
Being a vegan sounds so retarded
Reminds me of Kevin O
05not eally Eli
/me distractts you all with James Turrell!
Kevin Oleary telling a lady that her product tastes like sand.
0580% of the pointers here have been true
Well most people are vegan for ethical reasons.
I support animal protection of most kinds, but PeTA is something I feel is damaging the cause- so I don't like them
05facts
James Turrell, guys! James! Turrell!
It's all lies.
Wrek: yeah. i wouldn't be too sure about that
Nothing is true in this world~
boy, if only i could find that image about peta
fact: steak is delicious
11,02Eli: How is it pointless? We're discussing the opposing arguments against their actions with unbiased opinions.
05for isntance?
Vivix I must send you a Picture >.< (has nothing to do with the current discussion) -.-
Mm? Send away Lil_B
Everyone is biased.
There is no such thing as an unbiased opinion.
Yeah, but as an organization, they could have done more research to base their manifest on
I like trains.
11,02I see being a vegetarian as a noble thing, but I think PETA should be happy if people just simply cut back on their meat intake instead.
True-
05aye
hold on eli
hold on
just
11,01Hi.
hold on eli
11,02We're not saying they're doing everything wrong, but they are priding themselves on what the extremists do.
Hold onto your chair.
allo Nitty!
05sure eli
05but one thing i want you to do
Hi, Nittany_Discord. :)
I just think there are better organizations out there
05watch the penn & tellers bullshit on peta
Buytoast: there are fanatics in every organisation. would you like to be judged by the worst brony?
So peta wants everyone to chew on plant life for the rest of time
11,02Cutting open salmon farm nets isn't the effective and legal way of dealing with animal cruelty.
05and the evidence speaks for itself
Penn & Teller, put that on stream some time <3
Releasing minks from a minkfarm gives them hours fo pain and suffering
Hippies gone wrong.
worst brony is a poor statement
lol
they're all bad
NewSuperBronyU: fanatics
11,02Buytoast: O U
05it all comes down to this
05extremists and fundamentalists of any kind
05are inherently bad
Amen.
05dangerous and deterioate society
Wrek: that
Yeah
11,02Eli: There's a difference between fanatics and extremists.
Fanatasism. Already said that.
So how exactly is scantily clad women supposed to make me go vegan?
Simple
SpadeMagnes[School]: Boobs sell anything, that's how they work.
^
SpadeMagnes[School] can scanily clad women make you do anything?
But boobs make me want to NOT buy something-
Meanwhile: Wouldn't that make you want more meat though? ;)
Not really
11,02I'm a huge fan of My Little Pony, but you don't see me going to paint horses that don't belong to me in different colors or torturing someone else to be a brony because it's the 'right' thing to do.
GilDash: Badum tish.
LOl
Vivix does that.
Meanwhile: Thank you, I'm here all week. XD
Nuh huh!
Goes to the stable and paints the horses.
I dont have a issue with naked women but the way they try to get people to go vegan is stupid
05still no stream?
LOL painting peoples horses… theres a good idea...
I doon't paaint them ;__;
Wrek: nope
Don't lie.
Wrek: Nope.
05jsut cause i can
05gona do this
Wrek doesnt look like it
NewSuperBronyU: you don't, but i have seen painted horses
I don't like real horses at all.
I'm totally just gonna go hose my neighbours horse with pink dye now.
^
I love real horses
I bet you do.
Wrek: you WERE streaming only 5 minutes ago, nobodys given a damn as of yet I guess
Nasty Vivix.
They're cute and nice ;__;
NewSuperBronyU, I love you just saying
SCARY, but nice
Jmo you just have one great comment after another.
Go see a counselor
Scary butt fun.
;___;
CrimsonPhoenix: Don't we all? :D
Thanks Brad :>
My aunt has a farm with horses on it. I like them, but their mouths kind of freak me out. :S
I like nuzzling their muzzles-
Their...mouths?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PNt6DjlvT0&feature=g-all-lik No stream?
the only thing that freaks me out is their eyes. GOAT eyes!
ah, here it is
So how exactly was Peta allowed to make a game with Mario and luigi in it and not get their asses sued?
http://i.imgur.com/jfsOR.jpg enlighten yourself Eli
Horses smell bad.
noo
Meanwhile: Yeah. Like when they yawn. :S
Meanwhile: they got big teeth! And they bite if nervous
GilDash, if their mouths are what freak you out... maybe I should tell you my story...
so does Vivix.
!
So...don't make them nervous.
/me burns Bronysith on a stick
It's not that hard to stand away from a horse.
Panda|Napping: That's up to you. :S
Buytoast: it's too small
Buytoast: ... yeah, seen that before
then squint
Slap a horse on the arse and it'll be your friend
Pinkie Style? Never saw that coming?
Even a horse that is freaking out will try to avoid running you over
Unless it has made you it's mortal enemy in this life and decided that it will risk it's entire existence to put you in hell.
STREAM
or so I learned
/me slaps Jmo's ass
oh boy, time for bullshit?
:O STREAM
its*
hot damn
O U.
Seriously, how did Peta not get sued for using mario and luigi in a game they made
Buytoast: but be honest: do oyu believe anything the internet tells you?

I like some meat, but a lot of it I just odn't like the taste of
oh yeah, and peta is free to kill about every animal they find?
Chrysalis would know what love is
but there's one thing I can't eat, and that's DEER
and ive got a kitten called lilly
After just reading Animal Farm, this is hilarious
I'm quite certain if PETA had their way, no one would be able to own "pets"
StinkomanFan of course
He has crazy eyes.
Puppy :)
DOGGIES
MadSurge: Same here.
something like that, yes
Yay stupidity

When I was 12 I got the Science teacher to admit that venus was hotter than mercury because of the Atmosphere. GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Thanks, Swedish is one of the most secular country in the world
It's adorable mostly because the Jewish faith (you know, the guys who wrote the Old Testament) acknowledge that the Old Testament's account of creation is meant as an educational parable to help demonstrate the concept of original sin.
oh man

i have absolutely nothing against believers. but srsly... don't talk shit like that
need proof for evolution, and yet push for the bible to be taught as scientific fact

Evolution Is Ridiculous
they proved evolution
Wrek: i live in cobb county... KMN
"historical"?
I am an ape if evolution is real
Religion is theory right?
CriticKitten pretty much yea
Pink3: You are an ape.
13and quote: "Creationists naively take biblical data literally (for example, to calculate the earth's age, they cite the six days of work in genesis 1)"
whats wrong with that girls face!
05fun fact
Meanwhile: :L
05virgin birth is a translation error

Wrek. <.<
05it was young woman
13the goddamn pope remarks that creationists are misguided :3
o.O

Wrek interesting
Shizuka: IKR
Shizuka: You mean design bronystate right?

it hurts
Intelligent Design?

Wrek: im pretty sure theres a shit load of mistranslation, lost in translation, and my personal fav, ADDED during translation
13mostly quote, it's a annotated guide to the catechism that was put together under the current pope
I feel the bible is more of a guideline for life, not a literal rulebook
i want to play tf2 but it fails
I'm waiting for the next patch before I pass judgment on creationism.
HOW IS THAT SCIENTIFIC YOU FUCKTARD?
Because he said it in a complicated way.
That's how it works.
Can't we just think that God created two ameobas and EVERYTHING evolved from them?
And that "Intelligent Design" excludes evolution, because...?
easy there Eli :P
^
sorry twilight_sprinkle
That's not how scientific theory works.
Eli: its ok, how are you btw :P
Thats why I wanna go to Canada
it's sliding down a shitty, slippery slope
hi btw twilight_sprinkle

Because if you looked at it critcally "Intelligent Design" wouldn't exist in the first place.

Nittany_Discord: true dat
For now, Nitt.
08,01the dutch education system is great
as if he would let her choose
the only problem i have with evolution is the change from single celled to multi-celled organisms
Eli: there are people that believe anything, ive accepted that a while ago. some think ponies are satanic :D
Welp, send them to private school then.
Meanwhile: Only on Fox News.

Evidence...?
The bible, the following is a work of fiction and any resemblance to any persons living or dead is entirely coincidental...
I've got a Holy Bible... it looks like swiss cheese. XD
LOOK AROUND YOUR
*self
13the problem is there is no evidence of creationism, it's merely an interpretation of evolution's findings
what evidence is there?
e
...Was the Bunny a Male, Female, or Prince?
THE ONLY EVIDENCE I NEED IS THE GOOD BOOK OF JESUS
I understand this mans point actually

yes, becausem every school can afford electron microscopes

well im not brb im not gonna type 4 a bit
Okay, kids, which of these sounds more reasonable? a) The world evolved over thousands of years of history, demonstrated with lots of evidence. b) You were made by a god who is everywhere, sees everything, and loves you so much, but can't be detected or measured or quantified and refuses to step in to save the people he loves when awful things happen? :D
i know my brains' frying too
08,01i'm not convinced that the universe started with a Big Bang

can we watch something else now? all this talk about creationism is getting to us >.<
D:
I love the M theory too(though i understand nothing of it:D)
I can see that Shizuka.
sometimes i ask myself if they really belive that shit, or if it's just about the money
Shizuka: As said, I'd rather trust Satan, who killed 5-6 people, while God killed countless millions.
Shizuka, yup.
:>
True facts that jesus rode a velociraptor into war...
In other words, God was formatting his harddrive
see i quite like that people will argue but evolution is just a theory
Vordox, thats a good point...
gives me hope
Eli02: religion has often been about money and power throughout history
Chinese Jesus is the best Jesus.
Shizuka: http://derpy.me/2LvOx

Ok.... WHY ARE WE ON RELIGION?
that maybe theyll think the same about the theory of gravity

It is interesting so yay

one more episode i like this show
is*
Wrek: Go for it. This stuff's great.
Do it Wrek!
No, really. If we're going to be fair, we should present ALL theories that explain life on earth, even the absurd.

Wrek: Penn and Teller are pleasant people and they do good programs :)
Scientology? Pastafarianism? Let them in too!
they didn't come up with angles, poles, magnetic fields and all that?

Careful thisguy they may put 3rd gen up

Just stating facts
GilDash: yeah but creationism isnt normally offensive, its offensive only if you really want it to be
its offensive because its attacking the foundation of science by pretending theres anything opinionated about it.

I knew it.

Teller is the Doctor:O
twilight_sprinkle: I don't find it offensive in and of itself. I find it offensive that it can be used to lable evolution as false, when all the evidence proves just the opposite.
suddenly time travel
Does it say OUTATIME?
why are they cosplaying
past=1 obama=0
ma tea!
i had a dream......
GilDash: well i wouldnt teach it by saying evolution is false, id jsut say "this is another way to look at things"
Theres already a insitution that spends all its time talking about intelligent design. Its called a church. Why does a school need to have time for that too?

do you know how a theory works? Intelligent design only reaches step one of the scientific method. Which is 'form hypothesis'. Which is "I think something intelligent made the universe" theres no evidence, no test, no way to prove such a statement. Its -not- science. not even a little and has no place in a science classroom.
Hi!
I just remembered how much I missed reading this chat.
Hi CCCP :)
Eli02: like i said, its more of a secondary view on things than forcing lies on peoples' thinking. yeah i wouldnt want my kids studying it, but imo if people really want to, then might as well let them
08,01Bronysith: i really do
08,01Bronysith: skype? :P
TheMaster, well churches are more about helping people who have a spiritual relationship with the aforementioned creator become even closer.

08,01Bronysith: how about i just buy you a maid outfit?
13not bad
how've things been CCCP
twilight_sprinkle: no. because it's clearly NOT true.
08,01Bronysith: can they be any plushies?
twilight_sprinkle: but i get what you say
It needs to be more than 'possibly true' you need actual evidence
and i get to pic em out
Hi Conyst and alexxm good!
an intelligent designer is just as likely to be a flying spaghetti monster as yahweh.
Eli02: im not familiar with details of creationism, but it seems they have their own weird logic that is just based on a superbeing. from what i can tell, its not impossible that theyre wrong
twilight_sprinkle: i think if i was smart enough to get away from religions, others can do the same
like a sir ಠ_ರೃ
BABBIES
CCCP: Glad to hear you are feeling better :)
13and then there's scientology~
It doesn't force anyone to convert to anything. Its your own problem if you have a crisis of facts vs. faith. Evolution isn't up for opinion, its demonstratable fact.
twilight_sprinkle, have you considered the possibility that they're right?
Eli02: yeah i wouldnt recommend everyone to take it, but i wouldnt force anyone not to
And once everyone is the government no one is.
13huffpo is huuuuuugely leftwing and they know it
By all means, comply and pay your taxes - the other alternative doesnt end well for anyone
Dat grin
TheMaster, has it been observed?
Haha denmark
twilight_sprinkle: i have nothing against believers. just religions

Yes. Bananas, sickle cell anemia, whales with hipbones, chimps having 97% dna similarity. Nylon eating bacteria (for a material that didn't exist until the 1970s) I can go on
Still there is more toxins in amerikan food than most countries

lmao
They made ecoli eat a material that it has never been observed to eat before.
SCREW YOU RICH BASTARDS :|
Kandarihu: i cant prove they are wrong, i lack the knowledge of the theory to do so. if its based on the fact that theres a superbeing, well, as ridiculous as it seems, i cant prove it impossible, onlyabsolutely unlikely
FUK U JMO! FUK U
I like that logic.
what?
AHAHA
They forced evolution on ecoli germs, proving evolution.

he's say "you shall not taaaaaax"
taxing a church is a bad idea. It gives churches even more of a say in government.
Hi killer
since they'd want a say in those taxes
TheMaster, so did the e-coli bacteria produce something distinctly different from e-coli? Or is it just a new varient of e-coli?
Gandalf would lead the rebellion :3
Meanwhile: I've missed that
CCCP Oi
BUNNY
Spectrum_Rush: Not anymore. :3
Hai Meanwhile :3
But sometime around the 31,500th generation, something dramatic happened in just one of the populations - the bacteria suddenly acquired the ability to metabolise citrate, a second nutrient in their culture medium that E. coli normally cannot use.
there
Hi Meanwhile! :33
Yeah, I don't want to tax churches. Then they have a right to make demands of government at the expense of other religions. Screw that. >_>

Why?
If there's one concern about a Ron Paul presidency, it's that he's the center of a personality cult.
and that I why I have a dog >_<

Thank you Dick :)
Bye pony_155012

If Ron Paul got the GOP nomination, it would be one personality cult vs another personality cult.

Tovler: Revise your system, make it a democracy :P
Mom and Dad :)
AJIsAwesome: alexxm thelonepony Consty have you read my announcement?
Mitt Romney doesn't have a personality cult at all. The people who are supporting him values the welfare of the country first over the popularity of their hero in the history books.
Vordox: ok. Just give me about 3 hours.
CriticKitten: His Gold standard is a risk, but HUGE rewards can be done. And his Foreign Policy is the smartest I ever heard.
Dark92Enigma: Yes
haha
yep Dark92Enigma
lol, Shizuka and donutpop365 live in the same city >_<
Dark92Enigma: Which one?
its not like taxes arnt lower than they've ever been. The issue is that the corporations are so joined with government. Taxes are far from the worst thing government can do.
13Kandarihu: in fact quite the opposite, could argue romney has a sort of anti-personality-cult given all the bickering leading up to the nomination
inb4 they meet up >_<
AJIsAwesome: trying to scroll up usually lets me check if chat is dead
I think the gold standard idea is bound to bust. Too little too late. But the foreign policy is actually extremely intelligent.
I hope You come back soon from your trip Dark92Enigma :)

Now that I think about it, the fandom of Ron Paul is purely ideological. Supposing he were to become president, and his fans were to become more like enforcers, and he ends up making a mistake. Will his fans forgive everything?

Best part? Recent research is confirming that people who are slightly obese are HEALTHIER than skinny people.

Everything has a potentially deadly side effect - get sick? take this pill, side effects are worse than actuall ailment
and cornsyrup

11,02Sumica: It's the name of a burger >>
Silver_Soother: Yep! Mind, it's only slight obesity. But it's actually healthier to have a bit of a gut. Skinny folks tend to have less nutrients in their body and are more vunerable to disease and other problems.

I've never heard of half of this stuff.

Bronysith: Yeah.... :\
Waffle House. Oh my gosh I love their waffles
RaveBrony: I liked Chic-Fil-A, but then the people I lived with heard about their gay stance before I did, then I was forced not to go.
my Stats teacher has an unhealthy obsession with chick-fil-a
00,10nuts can bark?
And their hash browns!
*I don't support them any more, after it was made clear how they spend their money to fight gay rights. Hey, it's their money, fair enough, and they can spend it how they like....just as I can choose not to spend MY money there.
ASoftFluffyThing: waffle house has best waffles!
:D
13you are an unfit mother, carls jr believes every child deserves to have a caring mother, your children will be transferred to the care of carls jr
cachi01: I NEED to go back to Waffle House.
Now I want waffles.
05mimi needs tos hut the fuck up
cachi01, yes. A million times yes! Have you had their chocolate waffles?!
Crlton
00,10yeah shut her up
*carlton
THAT switch :D
Mimi really does need to stop talking.
bliss point eh?
AJIsAwesome: same here. its been a year since i went last time
sounds like a kung fu sex move
Wrek: how about we force feed her big macs for 2 weeks
PISS OFF MIMI
As far as burgers go, there are different compenent to each fast food burger that if taken out and reassemble into the best of everything would make one epic burger
shes telling the truth though.
Uh.
Who the fuck is Mimi?
I am sure Lyra` has a way to make her stop talking. Oh yeah....
ive read this everywhere
SHUT UP MIMI
hey mimi! ^*&^ you! =D
Wrek: Remember! The Video I linked you last(About the Fries) You'll LOVE the reactio in the stream! TRUST ME!
cachi01: Year? It's been AGES since I've been there. :O
I eat BK because it's fucking delicious, STFU MIMI
00,10you bastards
or maybe they just know how make a fucking simple dish that actually TASTES GOOD!
11,02ASoftFluffyThing: She's the one that can mimic everything in Super Paper Mario.
tha'ts mimi
The thing is, Chik-fil-a is a minority
WAIT. WE ARE WATCHING IT FROM YOUTUBE? WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE NO BEWBZ RULE?
I love fast food. ;-; for the 4 minutes I'm eating it, it's like I'm taking a vacation.
A curse on the fact that this food is tasty.
MIMI NO ONE LIKES YOU... GEEZ :/
lol O U NewSuperBronyU
I go to McD as a last resort tho....haha
They making food tastier, to convice people to eat it - THOSE BASTARDS!
When I hear Mimi, I think of the Drew Carrey Show. Then Paper Mario. xD
13we keep eating nonstop... you know cause we kind of need to?
00,10exersise your fucking self controll
yeah fast food makers take advantage of the fact that food tastes good to sell food
But yeah, really, you're fat because you don't stop eating you five thousand pound fatty fat fat.
*they're
Sonic's meat patty, with McD's secret sausce, Chick Fil A tomatoes, nice crispy lettuce...:)
Pffft, screw salad :D
Alright I gotta go to bed now, good night everyone and thanks for the stream :)
Night, Colt_Brovakiin. :)
Meanwhile, I'm not a five thousand pound fatty fat fat :<
Cypresswolf: I could get some Sonic right now.... *drools* I NEED FOOD!
Meanwhile: the Rason it seems tasty is Because of what she said
TRAINING!?
The number of products that support gay rights outnumbers the number of products that don't
YOU MAD
:)
*reason
Everything is making me hungry! :(
Meanwhile: a kilo of burgers is like a kilo of carrots? :D
Oh, another fun fact: It's probably more healthy for people to eat smaller meals more regularly throughout the day than to eat three big meals at designated hours.
Cypresswolf: lol reminds me of Epic Meal Time's Fast Food Lasagna :D
twilight_sprinkle you're a bellend nothing you say matters.
shes being sarcastic.
Meanwhile: get an education pls, kthxbai
i wish i could eat at home more often...no one has time anymore though
i just want to point out that Taco Bell is probably the worse food i have ever consumed
CriticKitten: That's a hypotheis, right?
*worst
the ideas of the world.
wow… it's THAT impossible, huh?
/me ...back wherever that was I wasn't entirely listening.
nope. that would be boring
The Cook-Out makes some good hotdogs
o.o
11,02i liek nintendo :3c

/me Meanwhile......back in africa
NewSuperBronyU: who doesnt?

11,02cachi01: Meanwhile :<
/me slaps Meanwhile
Nintendo is evil. We've been over this.
Africa*
you get steak like shoe-leather there
ahaha
Bronysith: I used to eat out all the time; then I moved and am now doing home eating. I miss the eating out, but honestly; I prefer the home eating. When is the last time you ate at him?
oh mind games
11,02Africa isn't evil D:
Meanwhile: chaotic good to be exact
why are you so good
that sounds like a multiplayer map for a cod game
Nintendo is evil, but Microsoft is eviler
00,10it comes in a 55gallon drum in dowdered form. they hook up a hotwater line to the drum and have beans on tap
Silver_Soother: today :D
/me boops SB's moo nose :3
africa is always evil in video games and movies
Bronysith: Awesome! /)
JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW
Lyra`s been on cracked.
THIS IS ALL ABOUT PLACEBO EFFECT
its full of black people with guns who mine diamonds. kind of like dwarfs
so what, this whole episode is devoted to proving fast food is tasty? brilliant. all the money that went into this was definitely worth it, nothing hypocritical at all
Vordox: It's a very large point of contention nowadays, actually. Some argue it's healthier and helps you lose weight, other data suggests it likely doesn't. It's not verified yet.
Silver_Soother: i like home cooked meals over going out...except home cooked chicken, i dont like grilled chicken...unless it is actually done right
13can't possibly be because we're more active
I have big pants in my office, LISTEN TO MY OPINION!
GilDash: meh. at least they seel iphones for like 40 bucks

Wrek: That's...not much difference.

Vordox: Basically. I lean towards extra meals in smaller helpings being more beneficial though myself. Works well for me to keep my blood sugar up.
00,10but they say like 500

The wonders of psychology.
13SPARTANS, HOW MANY CALORIES ARE IN YOUR FOOD

Shizuka: HOO! HOO! HOO!
Shizuka: AWOO
CriticKitten: I'm more interested in how the body adapts to the huge intake of energy, Metabolism and all that
Meanwhile, Gondor, that's who.
SHUTN UP!
11,01Shizuka: 300?
fast food doesnt mean fattening - it all depends whats in it - Taco Bell often has fresh produce added to their food, ground beef is the same everywhere - only the idiots who dont know how to cook fuck it up - the sauce is sour cream, and its not even that much
Shizuka: over 9000?
I've eaten an 8 oz chocolate bar in about an hour

Mimi needs a Big Mac to shut her up,eeyup :D

00,10but you said you like chubbys Lyra`
Shizuka: it doesnt matter what you say, say it in french and it'll sound like "and later we'll do it all jight"

I don't know why but I want to slowly strangle that woman
Vordox: i dont drink soda often anyways :D
I cant go to a place like Chilii's without getting one of those chocolate cake things with molten fudge center & a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - ^_^ Desert of the Gods!

lolwut?
Wrek: Its a refrence k? :p
i pay about 10$ for a pack of smokes
Wrek: i dont smoke....but where i live its 10$ for a carton
Bronysith: Soda is around 20-30% Sugar(LOok at the SIZE of the drink of the soda mass, and then look at HOW much sugar it, And you KNOW what the worst is? The price is SO inflated, like you are paying for about 8% of your soda with the correct price...
Wrek it's terrible on the wallet to smoke
Remember the Prohibition?
I want a Baconator right now. :D

KFC YES
And the Cheesecake Factory! That 7 layer Suicide by Chocolate cake - mousse between each layer, fudge icing, chocolate shavings on top <3<3<3
YES KFC YES
*customers
Seriously, how many fast food places do you even have in like walking distance?
/me prefers chubby Lyra` but loves tiny lyra equally
StinkomanFan: pepperidge farm remembers it

Cypresswolf: I've never had anything at Cheesecake Factory. I need to go there sometime.
Wrek: *Pokes you about the VERY final video I linked again, just cause it PROVES something*
Meanwhile: I do too, not only do I feel terrible about it I also feel sick afterwards, fast food and other greasy stuff makes me sick/stomach ache.

13i love when penn does a monologue and teller's in the background performing hax
HAX?
MONEY CORN
Lmao
HAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fav meal to get at mcdonalds would probably be, 1 Mcdouble(no pickles) small fry, and water
Shizuka: You ever heard Teller's voice? :)
:D
Meanwhile: honestly atleast 7 are within walking distance in my town
Does Teller ever talk? It seems it should be Penn's Bullshit.
AJIsAwesome: warning, that chocolate cake (as a whole) is over $100 - by slice its not that bad - but well worth it
:D
FUCK. YOU.

Oh hai, MadSurge, you're on too.

Shizuka: Me too <3
Cypresswolf: :O
13yeah seen a video of him teaching a trick

Teller's talked a couple times. He's very soft spoken.
I've always wanted a whole one to myself :)
Shizuka: i've seen a few
I could die happy :)
I heard Teller's voice last year.
Bronysith: ah okay
Bronysith: 10 chicken Mcnuggets, 3 apple pies, large fries and a medium soda

Bureacracy being absurd and uneffective - what a nonsense!>_>

00,108 bucks wrek
MadSurge: How ya doing?
/me licks Everlasting_Joy s nose
NO.
My baby brother was born in november 2006
Shut up, woman! :[
Hi Everlasting_Joy
I eat like 3 fast food a week.
hello Everlasting_Joy
13so here's a good question for mimi... why is fat bad
same here Tovler /)
The government's job is NOT to tell people what to fucking eat.
Sumica: I did, so?
13why do YOU care if other people are fat
Wrek: I did, so?
Shizuka: technically isnt fat good?
That fat keeps those kids warm in the winter! Toughens them up!
05that is the max on how expensive smokes get here a pack
Holy crap! All the "hi"s :).
Mimi.......i will say this one more time.tits or GTFO
Shizuka: ah! that is the million dollar question!
!cd
Next episode air time is unknown.
thats an ugly look for her face, id love to wipe it off her face and replace it wtih... well, not safe for chat stuffs :3
because diabeetus .-.
7.9 dollars for a pack of good cigs .... no wonder i canä't aford it
:(
Shizuka: not being a fat person im ean
same here Dark92Enigma
mean
I eat unhealthy shit all day long and I still only way 150 pounds
00,10did what Vordox?
Amen
donutpop365: tired, had a day at the pool :)
Sumica: I think Wrek found a eater egg
Thanks mom!
at which point I'd regret every burger I've ever ate, but I'll let future Tovler worry about that.
easter egg*
Shizuka: she's one of those people who dont want to have to see fat people anywhere
13Bronysith: well yeah there's the "you need fat to survive winter but too much kills you" but still, shouldn't it be your decision?
Shizuka: obesity is proven to be unhealthy. a bit of fat doesnt hurt anyone though
What a nice lady :)
Wrek: Are you streaming?
MadSurge: A fun one I can assume?
05aye Everlasting_Joy
"Bullshit" took a huge downturn after the first season.
MadSurge: Or swim team?
Governments exist to provide services and protection for their citizens. NOT to regulate what they get to do. Screw that logic. Go eat a goddamn Big Mac, Mimi.
00,10wrek you would pay 90sek for them
MadSurge: Or both!
Shizuka: my mom says: so you could look better and get a girlfriend, and get healthier, and avoid heart attacks, but that's her opinion
Dat rage
donutpop365: swimming on my own
Shizuka: i just say what my father used to always say.... MODERATION MOTHER FUCKERS
hm, but what if I have a stroke and can't play videogames but I keep on living.
to makes africa pissed off.

donutpop365: yup :D
well that was bullshit. all they said was "fast food is tasty"
