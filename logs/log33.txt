Agree
Wait
Which word do you agree on color or colour?
Colour

Since i feel brittish in some times
I'm leaning on "color" xD

Color is shorter

Go home and get a username

Asia Power~!

WOHOO
*sniff* Deep South. *Is deeply dissapointed at lack of bronies*
Global Domination
For we are global
of course I´m Team Luna :p
Aww yeah
I call Team Lyra.
I'd pick dark sicne thats the time when theshadows come
Team BRONIES.
TEAM LUNA
Okay
If you get the P3 reference.
lol
Luna FTW
Lolcan'tdecide.

what?
that was for Lars btw xD
Ha
I forgot the reference xD
Ha
now we need more season 2 Luna

You mean more luna in season 2?

Because shes cute
or baseball :p
AND ALL
http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/566150
because she´s a shy, possibly guilt ridden pony who hasn´t got a friend in the world? tragic characters get a lot of appeal
Anyone plays that game
[12:02:08] <Revolver3> IMMA STAB THE HAY OUT OF HIM.[12:02:21] i cant have any hay in me[12:02:27] you munched it all
nope
c:
D:
Aww
Baaaaaah
Where is Sprinkles?
Gonna munch ALL the hay!
I'd bet that most ponies in Equestria would regard her the same way as Celestia.
...
XD
13Hola!
its a glitch
If there's anything ponies are good at, it's forgetting xD
Its a nice game
Howdy!
With a crossover of TD games and pokemons
Haven't seen Sprinkles post particularly recently on ponychan :/
she proablçy has a lot of emtional bagage
*probably
Anyone have Beathazard and want to play MLP songs?

hey user
Would I get banned if I mentioned Cupcakes?
xD
So no idea hehe
YES
I need to talk with hiiiiiiiiiiim
uh, nope, it's just me, ga-*shot*
D:
or talk about it ecessively
I'm scared for my life now.
That's all I'm saying about it.
excessively xD
I'll have a look in some threads, if I see him I'll mention it
i hope her epsiode is a good one :p
Add me on Steam if you want to play some FIM songs in Beat Hazard. My Steam community page is /4tens
and she uses an abacus
I'm sure he'll show up here as soon as he gets on the computer
that's not canon xD
He's the one streaming today right?
but it would be awesome if it was xD
well they already made DJ pon3, Derpy and brony cannon terms...so what´s stopping them?
Fairly sure Sprinkles is doing the Saturday stream.
Not this one.
He'll be here long before the stream starts though, I'd expect.
accursed back space xP
I think I read somewhere that the pre-show was starting at ~2pm EST
PING
don't remember what thread though
I feel green
whut?
xD
Damn, does nopony have Beat Hazard? )=
anyone sees me in green now?
Nope
nope

4:)
I have 2 million money in a game
Am I FourTens?
mibbit isn't that bad

You are required to take French or German at my school.

May I make you a dress?
This fur is exquisite, Pinkie gave me it.
I'm not sure.
4my school works with 9 days, 2 cycles
no, sadly no xD
10Well, that means hi :P
It would have to be a dress fit for a man.
13I had to learn French for 3 years and German for 2 years in secondary school, I've forgotten most of it now though |D
orlynao?
4i used to think mon ami was one word

06Just with spanish instead
06xD
oh, i see floof through mibbit :3
4i'm trilingual
4trying to learn japanese |D
What does that have to do with clothing?
Rarity, may I ask how the hay you get fur from a pony like Pinkie?
13I'll never forget that un stylo means pen though LOL
10I wish I had the time/motivation to learn Japanese
Mushroom soup was nice
13don't ask why
13|D
10I just learn a few words here and there, from watching anime

06Click an award and it should show you.
Um

4the thing is
Kind of strange, isn't it?
4it's not till now that i can win one
You didn't answer my question Rarity_
4:P i just saw my name in chat stats

I just wish they came with more accurate pets... Like, Rarity comes with a bird instead of Opal, Pinkie doesn't come with Gummy, Twilight comes with an Owl but it looks nothing like Owloysious, Fluttershy at least comes with a rabbit
And Applejack comes with her dog, but no hat
Damnit, lol
Applejack?!

13Why?
This is late but angel, I think they're easier
MAN!
The pc98 games
going to poker with my cousin now, BBL, going to lose first xD
/)^3^(\ So... Awesome!
PLAY CANASTA
Theyre hard cuz of no hit box and no death bombs, and of course visually
Hey
haha
yes
4I was falling and i couldn't move or swap
wait, how do you make that....
4it went black
But I beat mystic square in two tries, the first literally being the first time I've played pc98
er, who's the boss around here
13Okay
Fireant right now, I think
/)^3^(\ SO Awesome!
hm, made it a command somehow
13oh god, no hitbox D: The main reason I installed a texture pack onto EoSD was because of that |D
when I put a slash before anything
put a space before the slash
put a space before doing the dashface
Well, I run #ponygoons over on SynIRC, and uh
13but the weird thing is that I seem to play EoSD worse ever since I installed ito-o
/)^3^(\
YAY
I was just thinking maybe you guys should make the porn channel a bit less prominent
/)^w^(\
yay~
lol i did it so
so wrong
What with the media attention and the chat widget showing up on EQD's front page
Lol
Well if it helps, eosd was the introduction of spell cards
heh?
13ShoutWiki is down... again
Porn channel?
So everything before it, no spell cards
*winks*
AfterDark?
The patterns atte really simple
No one force you to enter there.
...are
2atte + l
2latte
02Oh yeah, I have TH: 1 - 4
4Yea i saw that
Problem.
Solved.
That's not the thing, though.
02But I need to get my emulator to work >(
Porn channel?
it's not a porn channel
...
it's an adult channel!
same thing
okay yes I'm sorry for wording it like that
and you know it
hey everypony!
Hi strais
13I just hope it won't last more than two months
hey night
Sorry Redeye, I don't see a problem. So stop finding them. :)
4Yea
13...again
hmm
It's the 4chan style of channel. Ponies from all over with little grasp of how sentence structure actually works.
get 5 :D
2i wanna 3DS
Mystic square :D
02My Emulator Doesn't work ;_;
2but only cause of Luigig's Mansion 2
I WANNA FS11
2*Luigi's
I own my own airline company
2i think i just swallowed pollen
So, quick question, how many of you are using EqD's irc plugin at the bottom of the website, and how many of you are using an irc client?
2or whatever is flying around in this city
i used to, i'm using xchat now
yikes
I'm using the one on the front page
Xchat.
4Edit no i mean you don't have to have a email sent to your account
13Oh
2geez
2it snows in summer and winter here XD
2do you think Luigi's Mansion 2 deserves a topic?
13About ShoutWiki, I think that they will continue to crash every couple of months.
4I never got one and i'm here
4Yeswe need to move
Colloquy
Bronies are man-babies? Really?
Where do you live o.o
That's f*cked up
Snow in summer?
Even for Fox News
what happened
3not actually snow
Hello gentlecolts!
3there's a bunch of white fluff being blow around like snow
13But we don't have his e-mail
Anyone up for some RP?
http://www.fox2now.com/videobeta/?watchId=cbf5555f-0451-4615-9b6b-772fa46baf30
3and i swallowed one
13Plus he's rarly on these days
Fox News is just retarded
13Oh 4h8ey 9g11uy12s, 13w4ha8t'9s 11ha12pp13en4in8g 9in 11t12hi13s 4ch8an9ne11l?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqEDIFfy4Yg
Who listens to Fox news anyway?
Lol
And actually quite a damn lot of people
3it would really look like snow if it weren't for the black seed(?) that's in them
Sadly
3plus less fluffy
10Rainbows
Oh those little floaters? Like cotton things
I just want to know WHERE he is getting this idea
Wait, what happened?
Which was actually why I came over here to suggest what I did
4Yea
3yes
3i mean
I mean, who listens to Fox news and actually matters
Fox News attack bronies
3the answer to that question is OSHA-YES!
6Oo
3:)
Give it a rest.
6There are already people here. XD
Why does anyone listen to faux news anyway?
06Fluffy, you sa- okay
when the hell did we start applying for disability
I usually just watch the news in general. But unlike most people I actually do my own research
Fox news, we make shit up
We should be happy, that we are big enough to be picked by huge media
And by research I mean look it up on Wikipedia
Which is STILL more accurate than most News Outlets
THEY ARE ON DISABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE OBSESS WITH PONIES HURDUR
Fireant, we've had four different interpretations in major media by now
13speaking of fluffy, I'm wearing pink floofy socks now
None of them have been exactly good
13and I'm eating a pasty
Doesn't matter.
What about Wired?
Wired's been the closest, I would think.
nobody does any reasearch, THATS the problem
13He needs to give the current admin buracrat rights, since a wiki is ruined without active buracrats
13but that's not relevant to floof
That was pretty accurate
13but still :B
You remember what that opened with, though, Ivan
13and hai Obsi~
i watch it for the PLOT
3OshaHello Obsi
I agree it was a good article but ehhhhh that interview
I should go eat leftover cake
3*Osha-Hello
No, I forgot what it opened with....
3lol
3yuu better bring me a piece
Interviewing a self-diagnosed Aspergers patient who self-medicated by watching ponies
Age 31
yeah...
/me sleeps on Angel's floof
oh
It was
One piece left ;-;
Not good
hey hey hey, leave Aspergers out of this
IDK what that is, but....yeah
Hey I don't mean to jump on it
/me imploofs
I'm clinically diagnosed
/me is leaving you with this sensless, silly nerdrage topic.*
so am i, so i'd like you not to bash it
06o.o
I'm actually Autistic, and I can't tolerate when people self-diagnose
That was my point
They chose a really, really skeevy looking interviewee
Sprinkles!
that's their fault then
3you WILL bring me a piece
Sprinkles
3right?
Yeh but you know people who read the article aren't going to evaluate that
you don't base facts from just one person
3RIGHT!?
One second
13Left
/me 3falls
4Yea
Anyways.....
Whatever. Neigh-sayers gonna hate. I don't have to validate my hobbies to anypony
3anywayz, should Luigi's Mansion 2 be made a topic
I propose we cancel our duel. I want to get some tournament duels in, and you're going to be busy all day. I can't do much while I already have a point on the line. We can restart later this weekend, when /oat/ won't be as weird as last night.
Prove Fox news worng? HAHAHAHAHA
I drive down the highway blasting Winter Wrap-Up at full volume.
What episode of MLP is coming on?
4Hey...
Most people just start raging, I think the best satisfaction is a humiliating defeat in an actual argument.
HAHAHA OH GOD their heads are so far up their asses
2oops
13So, I've drafted the talismans for Glimmer and Idol Springs. 12 more to go!
Sound good? Or would you rather finish it now?
They still think Obama doesnt have birth certificate
we, will love and tolerate Fox News and their stupidity
Oh, that is LAME.
he released his long form birth cert nightofboomfer
4Nice
4I'm sick right now D :
4how so?
4right at the begining of summer?
4that sucks
well, that, was interesting
6...I'm good right now to finish.
4:
6It's not going to take half an hour.
13I'm currently whiting out the background for my second DA image: a Weather Imp
Yes, but Glenn Beck and the Fox news Pundits STILL won't believe it, is my point. Do you think they're going to believe Bronies are sane if they're still into that?
What episode of MLP is coming up?
4Yeah
Whatever, Season 2 speculation-discuss.
Nothing we can do is going to convince them
4Osha-Hello Hooh54
Tirek
4My throat hurts like heck >.>
4And hi

Best way to show Brony pride:DISCUSS
1012Blue

Cutie Mark tattoo
Love and Tolerate Fox News
2i'm making a topic for LM2, but i have no idea ow a topic starts
2i'm kinda scared to post it :P
2*how
I didn't even know of the existance of that show before ppl started asking because of my OC name
I really just typed something random
I refuse to watch anything else on the hub. I don't want any of that girly frilly froo-froo nonsense.
13i've been thinking up a lot of random topics recently, dunno why
4Everybodies sick
It just SOUNDS little ridiculous.
4You press New topic
4its not that hard xD
4I've been thinking about that too
wow, i can't believe you guys advertise mature content that openly
Please pass the eggsalad
RAGGLE FRAGGLE
2lol
4but mostly importing games from another fourm I'm on
AH SOMEBODY HELP ME
2it's just that
User_270 why not?
2i've started a few topics
What mature content?
4Aw it got a new hand
Well, User_270, would you want the incompetence of EAD here? I would think not.
2but they end up locked sometimes
2or moved
2or etc.
pfft
06That's a good thing though Espy :3
4One got locked
mostly image reasons, since EqD is supposed to be the face of ponyfandom
10There's nothing wrong with it getting moved :P
2wuz the point of making a topic if i know it might be locked
Nightmare_Moon, I actually believe that EAD is way better thad EqD mainroom :)
4I got merged XD
10I usually move topics behind scene now
Nightboomfer thanks :D
nice
10Not making a topic annoucement or w/e
4But one of my games is successful
Umm what's EAD stand for?
/me then Lars ruined the chatroom
Afterdark
#equestriaAfterDark
/me 2is watching TV "Behind the Scenes on The Sky Temple of Lugia and Articuno!"
the mature content room
10Chao, if you want, I could look over your topic before you post it
in any case EqD is terrible, but this just further cements it
WHAT
Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development
Duh
4I also know someone who hates the :3 emote
06D:
2uh ok
Ah
2how do yuu do that?
I spent 45 minutes in EAD last night, I swear, it was like I was back in elemntary school with foals that couldn't grasp how the "cute dog leapt over the doghouse and ran inside for lunch"
4I feel quite foolish when i get a topic locked
User_270, dealwithit.jpg
4Same
4Or when i post in a pole that already finished :P
What...
10Just copy/paste it to me in a PM
2looooool. i forgot my mom was sleeping
LOL
Wait, so EAD is more mature or what?
Owned
what's up with all the hate all of a sudden?
Yes
13What got a new hand?
Nightmare_Moon, EAD is still good room to chill out. Also, its unofficial mods hangout room xd
4I got an idea last night
More mature than this.
How is that even physically possible....
2i said "how do yuu do that?" in RL and woke her up XD
EAD is for MATURE content.
Ali: This is the internet
4Ho-Oh theme for Fourm :3
Mature, in teh sense that a young teenager veiws maturity, with 'lawl' and 'lulz'
Yeah
13do we have a "what does your bedroom look like?" thread yet? if not, that one came to mind last night
Ha
What Nightmare said
Someone ate a broomstick here.
Gently, please.
Stiffs and squares :p
4Lol
13I was gonna post photos on said thread when making it, but I can't right now so I'm having to hold it off for a while .w.
:|
/me then Fireant kicked me
4The lava bird
4Let's say I have an awesome bed with a bookshelf behind, and a bunch of plushies XD
6_9 I am in too many chatrooms at once, text's flying by
1 31 am
Ha
So is EAD mature in the views of 12 year olds or 21 year olds?
And then?
EAD is a Lulzy room. Just accept it. NO one is forcing ANYONE to join it.
13Okay
10Kinda similar to this, Espy: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6981.0
/me then I awaited my kick
And then?
Ping
And then.
Ping
And then?
Pinnnnnng
Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
anyways I am off to watch ponies
2Osha-what is Fourm?
Ping?
/me 2flees
bye everpony!
Bye
4My bedroom is white
Ping
pig?
Ivan2294, whut? EAD is not mature room, like in "mature guys being serious and shit, discussing pony with philosophy..."
/me is expecting a kick from the mods who can't kick for their life (Is it working yet?)
MINECRAFT PIG.
13Yeah i was thinking that, but i was thinking more along the lines of how the room is set out and such o3o
EAD is MATURE for hardly PG content.
When you don''t activate your account for too long
4brb
I know, but it sounded like they acted more mature....
10That's fine
Nah
More mature than what?
People here?
yeah
Ivan2294, it's the 4chan sense of mature
This room reeks of madness xd
MADNESS
So which is more madness this or EAD?
/me is impossible to kick
THIS IS SPARTA
EAD is at last sincere with its debauchery
this, by far
/me cannot be kicked
...wait....
Hm
Why do I care again?
I'm still in the froove
/me read your PM, Chao
Oho
10You can create the topic in Gaming Galore :3
And got kickec
So, what is the best way to advertise pony pride?
kicked*
And then Applejack got high off apples and fell unconscious http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25265
I think the best way to just do whatever you want....
Agreed
2oh yayz
I couldn't believe i'm still hearing "Baby"
I'm going live in 26 mins
^^'
4I want to make a topic
Feels like screaming
02Wait What?!
02Silver, why is your show on FRIDAAAYYYZ?
its not
Don't push it on others, but just do whatever you want. Hardcore fans will probably put decals on their cars and stuff, while some of us will just have like a keychain or something..
Is my nick weird?
I'm hosting Chip-Out
No
and SSS
Better than mine

Thanks

Feels like hardcore
CTR is on an unbroadcastable laptop >_> and Kingboo is being an arse and saying school is more important :P

Megatron is a briony now :p
Sweetie Belle actually sounds like a really good name for a daughter, and scootaloo is kinda good for both boys and girls
13screw this, my descriptions are always vague and too long-winded when I can't just use photos .w.
*brony
13I'll just post the topic when my computer's working again |D
Ha
yeah AppleSoarinDashWINS, I actually like all the ponies.
Strange, huh?
hey, if the Decepticon commander likes MlP, who are we to argue

Hello again everypony.
I would honestly consider some of the pony names, but only the ones that aren't so obviously cartoon-related
The & in the name
is it really purple?
13but still not as old as what my previous one was
It is.
Twilight Sparkle.
Or i'm hallucinating
03o.o
Apple BLoom is cute
Okay
13The damn thing likes to bring up problems for no reason sometimes
Zecora?
Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Lyra are okay in my opinion.
Sweet.
lol no zebras
Zecora is Sweet. And Hawt.
D'aww
xD
WB ninjapwny
But some are just obvious references, like Rainbow Dash would be a TERRIBLE name.

we know that
New Topic, what is the best word EVER
Hello!!!
Pinkie: ... I don't think this is a proper sample set for such a question
Hiya derps
Hi
4o.o
Roleplay is open!
6...waiting too long, starting it anyway.
sample set...that sounds like science to me
yea
i got liks u science types
/me 2flees
Exactly
Memento Mori
Anybody want to join?
Science > Magic
statistics!
I go on about everything, and nothing
/me 4gives chase
I dont know how to RP
Reminds you of everything
Hence Twilight > Trixie
inb4 twilight is magic
Should i sleep
trixe > snips
its 1 59
4I'm here
6Hey Ghosties.
Twilight actually does science too
10simultaneously
@ColorSpectrum I'm there!
Arcane science
but science = magic?
no
/me 4floooooofs
Nope.avi
YAAAAAAAY.
has anyone seen thor?
6Do we have a video request thread up yet?
2You'll never catch me alive
Sure, I'll join in the RP, what is the topic?
2Run, run as fast as you can.
she is a speptic...its just in her world magic is real
2*yuu
alpha and omega yo.
skeptic
Right now I think we're starting something new.
What channeL?
Seen Thor. It wasn't bad.
Topic, Science = magic
13Not much longer now! We'll be happy for the game's release
nope
'where i come from [science and magic] are one in the same'
2Yuu can't catch me, I'm the MELONDRAMATIC CHAO OF FIRE, WATER AND GRASS!!!!!!
2gtg
It has to be!
/me 4goes light speed
its from thor
2seeyall
Is to be
4Bye! :3
4Video suggestions are supposed to be placed in the discussion thread...I think. We'll have to wait to see what Hipster says when he arrives. Typically, people would post in the discussion thread on /chat/ becau
4Hip
4Good
6There's Hipster.
haven't seen the movie tbh
4Yea
4Late >.>
Magic is worse than science, but in Equestria their science is our magic.
4Hipster, where should video suggestions go?
Hello.
Magic i s better, cause you don't to explain anythin
4I know it was always the discussion thread on /chat/, but since we're back on /oat/...?
so equestria = asgard?
4How does it stand
I like science bettter
4?
yep
/chat/ thread
And I am awesome, therefore I win
4Alright
WindBlown: unless of course you're trying to contain and control magic
4*goes to post*
6It's on /chat/ anyway, isn't it?
^
8so it doesnt gum up the selection thread
Spellbooks aren't just filled with kitten pictures
ponies are the soles of vikings
That also
so pinkie = loki
6And so does buffer.
8i love this video
I want to have a Civ5 weekend with pony folk sometime. :(
rainbow dash = thor
SAME
I can;t control magic xD
( ' A' ) I've been rickrolled again... hellow everypony
CIV V
I WILL DO IT
\o/
But we need other people....
Any more ponies wanna RP?
Yesh
6It freezes right there on this vid every time. Not sure why.
Also, we need to name our civilizations after pony things.
If you explain me how to do it I will be more than happy to RP xD
Lunar Republic anyone?
I want to pick France
What would arabia be?
4In any case, Sprinkles, you should probably wait until we get more people in here
Because France is pony canon
And Napoleon's bonus is OP
4Before you start airing video suggestions
appleoosssssaaa
8FUCK THIS COMPUTER
13Well, that was a short visitor
8STOP FREEZING!
What would be a good ponifeid name for Arabia?
4AHHHH
6...Why buffer?
4..............................
Camelot
( - A -)
8no me gusta
8D
It was the controversial twitchy tail episode
4What's wrong with your computer, Hip?
its not controversial
8i dunno
For some reason I read that as Came-alot.....
6...this vid is garbage. Gonna find another.
REV
13Maybe he thought nobody is active
No
8it just takes forever to boot up
unless u equate pinkie twitch = religion
. . .
Camelot
I feel bad now...
but most people dont do that
What's going on right now :U
8a million things pop up when i sign in
But anyways, Arabia ponified, what would the names be?
8kenan and kel is whats going on
For OOC RP -----> Join #EquestriaDailyOOC
Ponybia?
OOC? Wtf is that?
Sounds fun.
it would be camel-ot
What about Mareabia?
and the inhabitants would be camels
6Changed vid, that one was buffertastic.
sounds goo do to me
Marebia
4Um
Mare-rabia.
much like the buffalo are t he indiginous people of appleoosa
4This is as well
Afghan-istan?
memory: you need to empty it on your brwoser
Stallion?
Coltistan?
Afghanistallion
lol
I love Civ5.
same
4Let's see if I remember this episode
I ship Gandhi and Catherine so much
8sprinkles, you should get the videos ready a few minutes ahead of time so they dont buffer as much
I love mah wife. I like Civ5.
wtf...
Fillystanbul, not Coltstantinople
Appaloosa was on okay place to visit. Not a cloud in the sky at night.
burbank = Furflank? O.o
I just play....
6I have been.
13Sheeeeena~
... you know, not every town needs to be a punny name.
furflank just sounds l ike a furry paradise
4Hi :3
yea
hi Angel
lol FurAffinity |P
agreed xD
hi !Espeon
I'll play France with the capital of Maris
4sheeEEEeeEEEeeeEEeeena
D:
True, but every civilization needs something related to the show
8weird
Prance
just Burflank
4Yea
hi Hooh54
Maris, Prance
Riiiiiiiiiiipreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
auggghhh
06oo
^^
SO MUCH PWNY!
I'm not saying puns, but somthing show related, like the Griffon Empire for Germany
Oh god its the guys from Good burger... 0_o
so gilda = german?
buffalo are dicks
waaaaa?
I don't even want to think about Greece ponified xD
Trotronto
Otto von Bismarck is so cool
<Nightboomfer> Trotronto
8you mean the guys from good burger are from kenan and kel
nice
And I always play as Arabia so I want a good pony related name
6I love Kel's fedora.
Doesn't have to be a pun.
8the greatest tv show of the 1990s
I'm not that informed from a bad movie. :(
Mareabia was a great one Ivan
trotonto, canterda?
Tallasshee, any name?
4Fluffy
13I'm fluffier
13:3c
Here is the tricky question, which civ would best fit Equestria.
I think Britain
well
Britain
*England
Britannia
Well yes, England
agreed
equestria is obviously an empire
Because that queen
so britian
Dear gog that queen
She's such a troll
4http://www.wallpaperpimper.com/wallpaper/Animal/Cats/Fluff-and-Fold-Scottish-Fold-1-5HOX9ZPAZM-1024x768.jpg
4I don't remember this episode, but I already see how it's going to go
nah
Iraq
princess =/= queen
but
4Far Serperior
Hahahaha, Washington xD
princess = troll
It's a fan name, but it still fits...
Code Geass's Britannia, since it includes A-mare-ica as well
Washington's such a prick
10Superior?
What kind of a man names his capital after himself? :I
he didn't
little george xD
he didnt pick that
they voted on it
He did it on Civ5!
4I meant to say Serperior XD
and dc didn't even exist at first; the first capital was Richmond, VA
If you plays as Washington you can change it thus he picked it
And Lunar Republic is so Russia
Catherine <3
But Equestria contains Fillydelphia and Manehattan
Russia or Soviet Russia?
True...
and hoofington
Stalliongrad though...
6Nice vid suggestion, Ghosties. >>;
That is fandom only though...
when was stalliongrad even mentioned?
Equestria = world empire
4It's a good video :3
STALINGRAD
Fallout: Equestia?
Equestria = Equestria
Stalliongrad
4I already got another video in mind later
They suck anyways, only thing they got is a line o' sight bonus
Also what the heck is up with Washington on this game of mine? He just keeps adding more and more military units on my border.
90's show with pre-rcorded laught when I didn't laugh one time ince the show started. (ô~o)
Unless that is actually a big deal, but I've never had a problem...
"When Equestria took over Amareica, we lost our names. We became a number, Area 11."
4Destroyer time
While he knows perfectly well I could crush him anytime together with the Ottoman guy.
Equestria = GDI Lunar Republic = Nod xD
<.<
i need to read fallout
BBS, cya later crazies.
definitely
cya
Arabia = Mareabia
Bye Fireant
England = ?
Code Staremaster: LeLuna of the Rebellion
Bye, Antsy
13Okay!
What about Ottomans? What woudl they be?
just watch Hetalia and all your questions will be answere
4Kill a world make a new one
d
Trottomans
China? Japan? India?
True
Trottocolts
Nippony
woah
Trottomans would work great
Nippony xDDDD
Here comes another Chinese earthquake
13!espeon
NO
06But here's something vaguely related either way http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1162/vulpixfluffy.jpg

Nippony of course
06c:

Japan?

Pwninjas

8Trony, you know we have another broadcast tomorrow, right

You can just throw your units at your enemies all you like

Because always full strength
10Dat Vulpix
Oh okay
What about India
4Nice job it's got

10It is @ fluffy tag
Mystearica?
No, but we are just trying to make Civ V names for Pony countries
For Mystic Creatures
I'm from the Fillypines myself
Goodevening Everypony
I want them to fit the country not just be ponified
Maneila?
eeyup
Hellow SAthi

China has lots of dragon mythology so something dragon related would work well.

13<3
What was the only African Nation in Civ V again? I haven't play in a while

10Old
i think shongai or somethin
but the natives have to be diff species
02^\
06why so tiny
6*facehoof*
Why don't you call the African Nation Zebrannesburg
4No idea
13Not the size that counts, it's how you use it~
4Let's say it's a Kitten
/me 13is shot

4Thats not old
4this is old
4http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/20386/old_woman_hoi_an.jpg
6...why youtube?
6I've had this vid loading forever.
Civ V just names everything the *blank* empire anyways, so all we need are things for notifications.
put on MLP playlist ;)
4I have to admit, I'm definitely seeing this through nostalgia goggles
13Roaraaaa
4Nice
4MY EYES
As in, "The Zebras have Discovered Nuclear Physics"
6I. Dislike. Youtube.
wish i could play now...
oh lawd
Or "The Buffalo have declared war on the dragons"
Something like that.
6>.<;
4I. Dislike. Your face! AHAHAHAHAHAHA
but mah laptop's dead
good for you Hipster ^^; But I lived the 90's ans sure isn't mssing them for those kind of shows. :| But nevertheless I had saturday cartoons which aren't better when I think it
hmmm it's loading?
6It should be loaded.
6It was loading during the whole last part. >>;
4How's your connection over there?
We should make each civ a different species. Camels can be for Arabia
4Dat tooth!
13Still, I hope I can be as good as Aura and TNE, one day.
6Youtube is nostalgiablocking.
Egypt?
6My connection's fine.
It doesn't have to be a real species...
4No phones in the movies!!!
egyp can be falcons
13I've got tallent in drawing. Same with my step-sister

I just hope enough people show up for the re-streaming :/
4Which is technically 7 PM for all you englishmen
4I think...
6yep.

6That's why I chose that time.
hell yeah crocs!!!!!!
4It was a great idea
Okay, what are Aztecs?

burros
Crocs for Egypt ^^
8WE HAVE TO GO DEEPER

ah the adventures of sonic the hedgehog, good times, good times
What are crocs?
Crocodiles
Duh
Cricodiles

my sleep pattern is so frazzled at the moment
people dont seem to sleep as much XD
i know i dont
7Hey. :3
yay!
Danes should be something cool.
0_0
What is manly as a viking?
But the notifications in civ work like this "The *blanks* have tested the first nuclear weapon*
i luv this song
flutteryshys ass is an awsome song
Well, the Pegasus was originaly the name of Hercules's flying horse and not a species
7There was a 3.5 hour gap between finals. I found 4 other people playing Pokemon. :D
Sanrio.com has all sorts of non-kiddie stuff.
dat melody
4I always thought it was "loss" of control
Hydra
But it's a species in the show so thats fine.
Why'd that have to give it such a weird name though? :|
i dont know
also giggle at the ghostly simple joy remix is awesome
their could be a hydra race also....
Hydra seems a little OP
8its based on a song
HE STILL OWNED THO!
Danes could be trolls
but it's ok, as long as the song is good
13Awesome :3
Oh.
4Avast Your Ass was the original track
its based on a song by renard
8called "avast your ass" or something
13seems the Pokemon phase has died in my college
problem denmark?
Or giants
a valkyrie!
oh renard made it?
anypony been watching Game of Thrones btw?
Valkyr ponies?
7D:
^this
My fluttershy senses weretingling I came back and this ^^
i always like most of his stuff
theres many many many MANY other versions of avast your ass
4Renard's become quite the popular musician on YouTube
you can find it from know your meme
mer ponies?
8dont tell me, im gonna try and get caught up on it eventually
13when B/W came out EVERYONE was bringing their DS and playing it
I was wrong. Hello Kitty is almost 40 years old.
wouldn't that be Pegasi with armors?
Valkyr ponies? Wouldn't that pretty much just be Pegasi?
Warrior ponies who guide the souls of the damned off the battlefield? I like...
WAT
o-o
led by derpy
7And now, not so many?
thats one old kitty
13that died after about a week
derpy is a great general
Hello Kitty was created in the 60's
4I think that cat oughta be put to sleep by now
13I was the last to stop |D
or it should have died a logn time ago
8lol ghosties
60's???
lolwat
but japan has kept it alive
GOOD EVENING EVERYPONY!!!!!

13then the TCG suddenly became popular and everyone was playing that
I can't believe the 80's was 30 years ago
no man, jormungandr is sleipnir
EVENIN' DUBSTEP
4Hello Dubstep
wasn't she an overlord?
8hey dubstep

03that's because people realize how much B/W suck :P
6I I I I DONT DONT DONT DONT
13now they've all stopped playnig that too
It was first created in England : D
If you can find an alternate for Greece I can make Denmark Pegasi, but that would suck for everyone who doesn't have the DLC
6Hey Dubstep
13and now Yu-Gi-Oh is what everyone's playing these days =w=
wHAT THEE HELL???????
wow england really? didnt knwo that
7Heh.
Google says Hello Kitty's first appearance was 1974.
4Avast Dubstep's Ass
Well only the greeks had pegasi in their mythology I think
greece = hydra
yah Japan bought it
8MKMK3 is clearly on the hello kitty wikipedia page
lolz
lol
7That's currently... well, not popular, but there's a group of people around every day that play it.
gorgon?
greece= minotaurs
lol funny thing no
6Guys, I need more vid suggestions. XD I'm down to two vids after this before just a ton of old Nick shows.

7Mmm?
13I know several peolpe who have supposedly been playing since Red/Blue

6Also, I'll look for Pete & Pete
Valkyr Ponies are just pegasi-fine whatever...
Oh I got it
http://www.youtube.com/user/waxination Sift through some of his YTPs.

We can be Harpies
13since they were like 4/5 years old apparently
xD
...Aren't they humanoids?
8was all that the one with the dancing lobsters or was that the amanda show?
What about Hippocamps?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HStmvtkwE personal favorite :P

Danish trolls \o/
7People are imitating pokemon geeks? o3o
hippocampI
for the one skit where she goes "thaaaaaaat's me!"
there's an I
They can't be Humanoids
because it's the PLURAL
so whats going on here?
I don't like posting in Ponychan, chans scare me :U
hippocampus is the singular
hippo means horse
meh keep the Greeks as Pegasi, it fits
o_o
It has to be a species,real or fake
dont be afraid of ponychan, it seems fine
4Don't worry Doon
isnt the hippocampus part of the brain?
4At all
too?
yep
8lolwut?
4chan is only chan that scares me
13I remember a group of peolpe having to google what Jigglypuff's evolution was called because for some reason none of them could remember it
mostly cause im scared of /b/ and i know where ur coming from...
'Ιππος?
I hate that place
4Poncyhan's the Internet Love Machine
<3
8Ponychan is the nicest place ever
so
13it amused me
Civ V pony species to nations, that's what is going on
DID ANYPONY ELSE GET THE NEW ALICE GAME????
and it's where hippos go to college
we constantly have pwny on the brain?
The german version is cooler I think :3
7Hmm, did they claim they knew everything? :P
4DubstepMaster: I'm going to next week
Oh come on
Is there a normal species in Denmark?
No I just don't like chans in general :d

13I had a battle against my friend's bf once and he seemed so confident that he'd win
4Because it's awesome, Hipster
-_-
elk?
13he ended up losing twice
someone should make a thign where it loops, much like nyan cat
They forgot about the actual piracy that's involved in being a pirate.
7Hrm.
8are you sure about that?
Fine, moose
4I'm positive
Sea Pony or Elk, GO
13and he ragequitted in the middle of the third battle

02LOL, Overkill?
You're a true pirate when you sink several cargo ships.

8THIS SHOW WAS FUCKING AWESOME

Hi Randy!
Where's Mandy?

Ottomans can be Turkeys
Man, Arabia being camels kinda sucks
lol
it just gave me nostalgiashivers
She got pregnant
Is there something cooler?
lol
and what should Arabia be?
that makes me laugh
woah, we're still on Civ5?
I don't know why they don't make sketch comedy shows for kids anymore
they dont
A desert fox
this is the 90's
We already decided Camels, but I want something cooler
4Who played Mandy?
is there a pony mod to civ 5?
Desert Fox sounds awesome.
No
chocolate meatloaf????

I know, but why'd they stop?
There's that MAD cartoon, but it's too mean-spirited and lazy

Yes it would be.
http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/horsehead_noao.jpg this is what space ponies look like
It would have been funnier if they'd gone all Kids In The Hall and not made too much out of Tandy being played by a man
4CARROTS?
6Chocolate breathalizer
4THE FUCK
urge to kill... ...
'ok hi so my name is tandy and um it's been a while since i made a new video, so i decided cause of recent events that i could make a new videoo'
So did we get all the civilizations?
yay, nebula
DO IT IVAN!!!
lol
Yeah
I think we did.
eat the... celery stalk?
Civ% need attention!!
We need more Dragonforce PMVs, In my opinion
But yeah, danes should so be troll ponies. I mean they can just go "trolololol" at you trying to get protection from the sea and rivers while they destroy every bit of improvements you've built
i think you know what to do with this
0_0
OMG can't unsee now

it's a bad idea to throw ur neighbor off of a roof and say "hey look it's raining billy!"
DRUGS? YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER!
Flutter Ponies were creepy
those eyebrows
rofl
I'll be changing the document up a bit, but the civ names should stay the same
They're like Enterprise in that we refuse to believe they ever actually happened.

MALFUNCTION!
OH GEEZ IT'S A BLACK GUY
...he open his helmet and he's deing
8UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Earth Ponies have cutie marks and a special connection to the earth, so they are magical
he should be dead in a sec
aeiou

6REPAIRMANMANMAN
All ponies are magical
8lol gravity in space
AHAHA

Unicorns just have active magic
reapair man man man man
IT'S REPAIRMAN-man-man-man!
*spams backspace because ghosties called me out halfway through writing my 'SPAAAACE-related' post*
I'm pretty sure it's actually a planet millions of years in the future when humanity has long since died and ponies have taken to the stars, encountering unicorns and pegasi.
If EVERYTHING was magic, then nothing would be. Magic would - normal. Ergo Earth ponies
While others get passive buffs
like friendship

anyway back to all that
i just put it there to spark interest
Wasn't that apple tree something about Good and Evil?

the job i had in mind? Serial rapist.
Yesterday's tomorrow is today.

Eve didn't eat from the tree of life
Twilight: Rainbow Dash... Why do you Pilot the Saggitarius? I pilot it... because I want the Princess to be proud of me.
g2g
4FUCK YEAH
bye
What is the Saggitarius?
4God I love this show
See yo later, John.
8okay.jpg
you*
Artie's not that strong.
ohai ghosties :3
when i saw the bus driver, ithought he would have a high pitched "hey girlfirend" kinda voice
GREAET WALL OF CHINA!!!!!
4Ohai RainBroDash
I figured, Eva=Angel to humans, Saggitarius would be a mythical figure for ponies
I was born in 1994 and what is this?
/me shrugs
I wanna be a bus driver.
Basicaly
so do i
6I've honestly never seen this show.
4Sprinkles, you have seriously missed out
6PEDRO
4DAT THEME SONG
Eva was an angel in Jewish mythology
8i dont think i ever did either
You're not alone Sprinks
This show has aged beautifully.
I'd seen it a few times yeaaars back
not frequently
4This show is the quintessential 90's show
and Lilith was Adam's first wife
mom's plate????
I'm more of an early 2000s kid than 90s
Twilight=Shinji, Rainbow Dash=Asuka, Fluttershy=Rei, Celestia=Gendo
4Axel_Foaley: This guy is correct
I wanna be a bear!
anybody else think of any TV shows when they saw das bus?
I HATE GENDO!
*...munch*
i swear like every show has an episode called das bus
Luna/Nightmare Moon=Adam
will it be your master or your slave
WARM!
I think that guy is partially insane.
Seriously, new episodes could somehow air today and it wouldn't seem out of place.
Applejack=Kaji
all good characters are partially insane
hello
he's not insane, it's just the 90's calling
I bet Stew makes chocolate pudding at 4 in the morning.
8the kid looks like an extra from harry potter
"When the world ends... all I want to do, is be on my apple farm."

My bus driver used to do that...
http://www.toyarchive.com/STAForSale/NEW2001+/MOTU/Toys/Loose/VehStridorComplete1a.jpg This would be the EVAs

Lucky. My drivers could barely control the bus

They love us.

Scootaloo?
yeah, the financed a series that hit the complete wrong demographic, what are they gonna sell to us?
"We here at the Hub love ALL our fans, young and old!" from their Facebook Page
hmmm
little girls will still buy the pony toys, and now adults will buy them too
hasbro said that?
I still have no balls to go buy an RD toy
I want it so bad!

They love me.
iJelly

Freedom is for freedom peeps.
Even with the poor acting, this show is awesome.

Stu's raging!
It's 90s, what you expect?

Then I pressed her cutie mark...
Omnom
P.Celes: YOU'RE MY VERY BEST FRIEND
hey people
i should make a luna teashirt
Me: ...no want.
If they ever release T-shirt they will be for girls only me thinks...
13I just got like 8 different inspiration speeches on baking a cake.
lolz meats
meat...?

i want a teashirt... sounds tasty
Hello Fiddler.
what are girls?
They released some panties, but they're only in toddler sizes. I would totally wear some that were meant for adults
like im planning to do....mabie
lagz
What are Girls? I can't explain
of course you can print your own shirts, but that doesn't support the creators
So...
It's a shame that they didn't get to properly meet the meat.
girls are a mysterious beings that are made of energy.... and blood
he ate it
>.>
6I wish I rode this bus.
interesting
Okay, who wants to help me in naming these CivPony Nations?
intiguing theory

How are we deciding the pre-show?
Lololol, jk.
half-pony half-boy
wow
Needs moar meat.
Stay Gold, Ponyboy

We got the species, which is also the adjective. But now we need to actually name the nations
oh mice
horsepuns
thats a hard one Ivan
Where'd the bowl come from? :U

http://radionintendo.com/downloadcast.php?castid=117 :D

8afternoon alone with penelope...
The leader of the Diamond Dogs should be called Halloween Jack
Leader's shouldn't be too difficult, and neither should the shortened names
8http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/entries/icons/original/000/002/252/me-gusta.png?1300420314

It's the Full names that are hard to do.

zoltan the ponqueror
Unless you just want everything to be the *blank* empire

Sluggers

Equestria Empire, Diamond Dog Empire, Zebra Empire.
But that's BORING
Kick those kids out.

Evening
I'll call it a mess.

6Evening.
fudgesucker O_O
4Fudgesucker

Fudge suckars.
4That sucks Sathia :(

Rage.

Magic bus
6lol Carrot top Judas
He's raging.
thou hast forsaken him dude
I kinda like him now.
He's got the butt hurt.
We could just use puns for the shortened names
THOU HAST FORSAKEN MEEEEEEEEEE!
0_0 he stabbed him in the eye
A-MARE-ica
woah
4Stu is easily one of the greatest characters in the show
But we need full names as well
this is so good
lolz
Pete's gonna get murdered.
=D
Now Stu's going to stick Kaworu in the cake
so what did i miss when the power forced me to leave?
Well that was uncalled for.
you missed carrot top judas and his last supper
po
Big Pete became Stu's apprentice
The United Stables of AMareIca
i like ponies
Then he betrayed him
ha
DAT NUN
Why does he still have the whisk?
Hmm, fine
Nuns
Lets deal with leaders first.
disco stu
Where'd those Pennsylvania Dutch come from?
4That's the mark of a great character, one who carries a whisk
Because he's gonna stab pete with the whisk.
whisk his face stu!
4Uh oh
0_o ding dong the witch is dead
Wait a minute. This isn't Dead Heat.
Retard's Creed
XD
8if the bus is a rockin...
Anyone else feel like watching Evangelion after that Stu scene
The Diamond Dogs should be led by either Halloween Jack or Ziggy Stardust
there are to many ways to spell gryphon/griffin/griffon
Dundundundundundund DUNDUNUDN
lol
6OHAI STU
His only thought: IM GONNA RAPE YOU BOTH
i feel like we're being watched

They are using Stu, and I'm tha fool.
And then they turn around.
8okay bye!
hmmm.....where would gryphons stand?

Halloween Jack is a real cool colt, and he lives on top of Manehattan chase
I think so.
HE DIED
I'm gonna fuck you with a whisk!
and no he's back
Whisker still in hand
id like to be a gryphon...
OH GOD NOT THE WHISK
gaaaaaah
Venzuela here I come!
Whisker is the best weapon.
talons > hooves
You know she's a tree, right?
I be a tree
D'= I was ishing for bad end
doughnuts are even better as a weapon
I saved 25 percent on my car insurance by swithcing to Geico.
"lets take a break"
they have a good portion of the world fat
He must have winged that whisk for it to break a window...
lol
id hate to be a tree....pidgeons crapping on you and all...
The only way I can get more nostalgia-y is if an episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers came up nest.

And chickens taste like horse meat
I used to eat paste. Is that the same thing?
Welcome to AudioSurf, song.
Corpse Bride and Dead Heat.
But skittles taste like the rainbow, even though they are sugar. Why?
magic
But it's too spicy for Pinkie
Evil Enchantress is win
No, it's The Wizard and High School Musical.
skittles are very spicy
They must be.
This is Mario Kart right here.
I love High School Musical!
my favorite flavor is red
...
I wonder if there's a difference between regular Ponyville rainbows and the ones Rainbow Dash makes
@TurniBrony The police shal find only your pancreas.
lol
I bet Rainbows would taste like lasers
I do not enjoy listening and watching HSM.
ONLY.

Rainbows taste like rain.
PANCREAS.

4Hello people :3
well that remembers me about the first ep, about elements of friendship, that never got spoken of again
hope you weren't useing it or anything
/)^3^(\
Thanks for saving Equestria, girls
that was all a dream
I love dat face
I do believe he was.
Okay now back to your day jobs
ah...well shucks
I must leave now, but I will be on the mane events.
goodbye
i wish you could all be equestria girls
Good bye everypony.
The rainbow of light is probably a one-time use thing, or only ever in dire emergencies
byeeees :)
may the force be with youi
6See ya later.
guys, is there a brony night sceduled for today?
I'm not a fan of techno :\
i am now a ghostbuster *munch*
Random unrelated way of saying goodbye!
why yes there is :D
there is tomorow too
ill be on then
when does it start?
tonight that is
Since Ponies are responsible for the seasons, how do they clean up summer to make way for fall?
[16:18:59] *looks around* come on out heh ghosteh, i'm in need of clobberin' some 'dere ghostehs...
just over 3 hours i think
correct me if wrong
i am just knew to this chat, but is there a consensus why men like a series developed for preteen girl?
6Just under.
oh for f-
Because it's good.
lol
clever writing
PANCREAS
round chars
ah cool. I'm a little confused over US's time
it's a genuinely good show
its exactly 2:59
I like it because it's cute and lighthearted without being vapid or pandering
ADORABLE PONIES
anoponymous, you from UK?
yeah
It's the shock value. If I said I enjoyed Dexter's Lab, no one would look at me. If I said I watch MLP, the conversation dies.
stream time is UK time minus 5
so it's adding 5 hours or something liek that?
ponyboy: a combination of what Nightboomfer and NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr said :p
i dont totally remembe
r
so midnight for us in UK is 7pm for them
Nobody expected the series to be good, so ofc it spreads quicker
got used to GMT-6 time, not some wanky PST or smth =)
8Guys, if you haven't entered the selection lottery for next week, it's here: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/oat/res/35769661.html
lol
Because instead of "hmm another good series cool" it's "HOLY SHIT IT'S MLP AND GOOD"
=(
because you can compare it to older cartoons (that aren't mlp) and see that they have the same quality... high, that is.
='( that hurts man
lol
it's all confusing,because GMT =/= british summer time, and EST =/= Eastern Daylight Time
people confuse terms
Problem is, I consider Phineas and Ferb to be of the same quality as MLP.
well, some things are still genuinely good.
This is ridonkulos.
just a heavy lack of them
They are both really good shows, but it's the MLP that gets the attention.
because ponies
MLP = PPG + Foster's
lol moon rescue
+mlp
damn straight
:3
THAT
lol garfield and snoopy
ppg isnt even that girly once you find out it was soupposed to be for adults
I think that the focus on friendship is missing from a lot of other entertainment, and MLP is filling in the gap
More specifically, celebrating friendship without being unrealistically cheesy about it
i like this
no, if you watch the other shows on the hub that are for girls like Strawberry Shortcake...
Hello everypony
*watched only because it was right before MLP this morning*
and was going to be named the whoopass girls
Damn I hate Revenants.
finally picked my "good" movie just in case.
everypony*
ARTI! :D
HAI~
NunTenDooSiksDeeFohr: like you mentioned, P&F doesn't have anywhere NEAR the amount of negative gravity (and/or nostalgia) that MLP has
And they lived lonely ever after
It's Friday night!

MOTHAEFFIN FRIDAY NIGHT
PF is just Lampshade Hanging
How many shows match MLP's quality AND have a heavy focus on friendship?
but it's good Lampshading lol
I like Regular Show and Adventure Time
LOLZ HILARITY SHALL ENSUE
luck means nothing, it's all about preparation. i dislike exams, they don't call upon my strengths (i can never be bothered to prepare)
8OOH, OOH, Sprinkles, we should watch an episode of Stella!
6...darn, TurniBrony JUST left.
but thankyou :)
=(
regular show= rare good show on cn
Fat Albert may have matched the friendship thing, but not quality.
Me too, and the new Avengers show

At least Kel's smart enough to know if Kenan has an idea you should run.
I can't help you with this mission! The yellowness of my overralls may be tainted!
Uh oh
I have a feeling there's something on that tape
"Someday, Granny Smith, you will sire a family of apple farmers. Now don't talk back to your parents"
Because that would be funny.
Fuck, theres nothing to troll here :/
Ergo it must be

They're probably going to just replace the tape unseen and everything will go as planned... obviously
what are you all talking about?

Of course
Those of you who spent some points on your Genre Savvy skills know exactly what's on that tape.
i'm surprised there's no mlp old spice

Still, as it's technically illegal to do fangames, I am somewhat concerned as to what this could potentially do to us. While Hasbro might be leinent as long as exposure is internet based only...
Not this video

This gets me fasdhaifnuaifbf furious
I hate this video it makes me want to kill

Ok
4We all knew sooner or later FOX would point their little fingers at us
12bbl
Their silly little fingers.

In Russia, illegal fangames, as is pirating, is the way to go
hasbro has been known to take things down
Oh yyyyyyyyyeaaaaaaaaah him :|
RUSSIYA!!!
Every time I watch anything by FOX my IQ drops...
uh

02:3
I am 15 and what is this

This comment has been removed due to a copyright claim by Hasbro, Inc.

/me is will play TES III: Morrowind
6I'm sure this video is going to make me lawl. FOX is such stupidity.
does he watch MLP?
Fox is a legitimate source of anything?
I hope not
Sprinkles, you have no idea
FOX is like the onion news network
except worse
Onion ILR
has been muted due to a copyright claim by Hasbro, Inc.
IRL
Fox is like an old lady, they see something and think what they believe is fact.
hello
8apokalipse: except people actually believe it
wha...?
yeah
Onion News Network is the best news network
oh no

I don't know why but each time fox speaks about internet memes it fails
8for anypony who doesnt remember, this was the song playing in the club during Super Mario Bros
Best song ever.
orly?
FOX always fails...
lol rly?
it's also the best song of all time
indeed
I shall combine C4 and semen and make a "love bomb"
But we learned two weeks ago from Bill Nye that dinosaurs didn't exist while we did!
"I don't know why, but each time Fox speaks about ANYTHING it fails." Fixed that for you.
Fox news it always terrible. You can't explain that!
I this a new song? When did it come out 2011?

What? I like Green Day.
Moonbase Alpha
SHOO SHOO BE DOO
it would be good for the bad film next week
