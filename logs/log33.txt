A cuboid can be a sphere if you try to do it
10That's good to hear that it wasn't too challenging
4:)
Am I FourTens?
mibbit isn't that bad
4then again, i did win the award for having best grade in math
Am I you?
in french?
4yes
6_9
I can look again.
nice one, i can't speak even one word french xD
Ok.
4french is the main subject
I'm a little under the weather...
i live close to belgium, i believe that is the closest french speaking place to me
May I make you a dress?
This fur is exquisite, Pinkie gave me it.
10[12:17] <lightumbreon|mibbit> nice one, i can't speak even one word french xD <- Not even 'bonjour'?
I'm not sure.
no, sadly no xD
10Well, that means hi :P
It would have to be a dress fit for a man.
orlynao?
4i used to think mon ami was one word
06What Espy said pretty much
06Just with spanish instead
06xD
oh, i see floof through mibbit :3
4i'm trilingual
4trying to learn japanese |D
Rarity, may I ask how the hay you get fur from a pony like Pinkie?

10I wish I had the time/motivation to learn Japanese
13don't ask why
13|D
10I just learn a few words here and there, from watching anime
13^
4hey, to win an award, do we have to tell the admins about it
06Click an award and it should show you.
Um

Kind of strange, isn't it?

4Spyro Dotd
Clopping to plot isn't that bad.
Hu hu haa.

/)^3^(\
I was just thinking maybe you guys should make the porn channel a bit less prominent
/)^w^(\
yay~
Lol
heh?
13ShoutWiki is down... again

That's not the thing, though.
02But I need to get my emulator to work >(
Porn channel?

okay yes I'm sorry for wording it like that
and you know it
hey everypony!
Hi strais
13I just hope it won't last more than two months
hey night
4Yea

It's the 4chan style of channel. Ponies from all over with little grasp of how sentence structure actually works.

Mystic square :D
02My Emulator Doesn't work ;_;

I'm using the one on the front page
Xchat.
13Oh
2geez
2it snows in summer and winter here XD
2do you think Luigi's Mansion 2 deserves a topic?
4I never got one and i'm here
4Yeswe need to move
Colloquy
Where do you live o.o
That's f*cked up
Even for Fox News
Hello gentlecolts!
13But we don't have his e-mail
Anyone up for some RP?
http://www.fox2now.com/videobeta/?watchId=cbf5555f-0451-4615-9b6b-772fa46baf30

4Yea
3yes
3i mean
6Oo
3:)
Give it a rest.
6There are already people here. XD
Why does anyone listen to faux news anyway?
06Fluffy, you sa- okay
Fox news, we make shit up
And by research I mean look it up on Wikipedia
Which is STILL more accurate than most News Outlets
THEY ARE ON DISABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE OBSESS WITH PONIES HURDUR
None of them have been exactly good
13and I'm eating a pasty
Doesn't matter.
Wired's been the closest, I would think.
13but that's not relevant to floof
That was pretty accurate
subtext and PLOT
13and hai Obsi~
i watch it for the PLOT
3OshaHello Obsi

/me imploofs
I'm clinically diagnosed
/me is leaving you with this sensless, silly nerdrage topic.*
06o.o
I'm actually Autistic, and I can't tolerate when people self-diagnose
That was my point
They chose a really, really skeevy looking interviewee
that's their fault then
3right?
you don't base facts from just one person
3RIGHT!?
One second
13Left
/me 3falls
4Yea
3anywayz, should Luigi's Mansion 2 be made a topic
I propose we cancel our duel. I want to get some tournament duels in, and you're going to be busy all day. I can't do much while I already have a point on the line. We can restart later this weekend, when /oat/ won't be as weird as last night.
Is there a way to email fox news on the subject? I just want to see their reaction when people prove them wrong.
4Hey...
2oops
13So, I've drafted the talismans for Glimmer and Idol Springs. 12 more to go!
Sound good? Or would you rather finish it now?
Oh, that is LAME.

2i'm making a topic for LM2, but i have no idea ow a topic starts
2i'm kinda scared to post it :P
2*how
I really just typed something random
I refuse to watch anything else on the hub. I don't want any of that girly frilly froo-froo nonsense.
13i've been thinking up a lot of random topics recently, dunno why
4Everybodies sick
4its not that hard xD
4I've been thinking about that too
wow, i can't believe you guys advertise mature content that openly
RAGGLE FRAGGLE
2lol
4but mostly importing games from another fourm I'm on
2it's just that
User_270 why not?
Well, User_270, would you want the incompetence of EAD here? I would think not.
2but they end up locked sometimes
2or moved
2or etc.
pfft
06That's a good thing though Espy :3
4One got locked
mostly image reasons, since EqD is supposed to be the face of ponyfandom
10There's nothing wrong with it getting moved :P
2wuz the point of making a topic if i know it might be locked
4I got merged XD
10I usually move topics behind scene now
Nightboomfer thanks :D
nice
10Not making a topic annoucement or w/e
4But one of my games is successful
Umm what's EAD stand for?
/me then Lars ruined the chatroom
Afterdark
#equestriaAfterDark
the mature content room
in any case EqD is terrible, but this just further cements it
06D:
2uh ok
2how do yuu do that?
4I feel quite foolish when i get a topic locked
User_270, dealwithit.jpg
4Same
4Or when i post in a pole that already finished :P
10Just copy/paste it to me in a PM
LOL
Owned
what's up with all the hate all of a sudden?
Yes
4I got an idea last night
More mature than this.
How is that even physically possible....
2i said "how do yuu do that?" in RL and woke her up XD
EAD is for MATURE content.
4Ho-Oh theme for Fourm :3
Yeah
Ha
Someone ate a broomstick here.
Gently, please.
Stiffs and squares :p
4Lol
/me then Fireant kicked me
1 31 am
Ha
And then?
EAD is a Lulzy room. Just accept it. NO one is forcing ANYONE to join it.
13Okay
10Kinda similar to this, Espy: http://www.lugia.us/forum/index.php?topic=6981.0
/me then I awaited my kick
And then?

If EVERYTHING was magic, then nothing would be. Magic would - normal. Ergo Earth ponies
While others get passive buffs
