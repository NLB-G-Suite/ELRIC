he doesnt go that way
05,15Good thing they can have sex through their clothes
00,10dem magics

He does evil dances
ok guys, i wish i could stay but my eyes are watering and burning at the same time. i need to sleep. NOW

Ghosties, makes good point.

08,01PaladinDrunkenwolf: cometobed.png
Oh no in trouble.
they'd probably have kept them as slaves
04I spin magic, Kirz?
but they all fell victim to disease
Tulio is not happy
04You give me too much credit, good sir
Meanwhile actually it's up to debate what they did, because why sacrifice a losing team to the gods (?)

Macgyver would use a leaf and a stick to break the gate
11,01And here's where they give the gold up.
the armadillo is the true god
So who made the original map to the place?
Fire and destruction.
Melee range = Metal armor + Swords

Insulting does nothing, otakon. :S
how would all that gold float?
Het you are only to give hints not full blown stuff away
Oh cool.
NAAAAAAAAAAAO
they have obsidian though which apparently is really storng and take very long to break
So according to the legends, I suppose the El Dorado must be pretty damn close to the largest gold mine ever.
See how amazing we can work together.
this sounds like Pirates music
Sundaysmile: it got wet. you know how wet cats are
Stuck sail!

Or they should have waited the week and got the bigger boat that could carry it all
Bye bye my precious gold :'(
she got all wet
why white clothes no react like in real live?
Suddenly the horse is back
Jim: To close El Dorado.
Jim: No time to get the gold off the boat I guess
sex or gold.... hard pick
They'll probably end up with one or two pieces of gold left.
I'd be happy with that.
05,15Chel>>>>>>>Gold

Darkspine, too bad the cry icon isn't Rairty
wet Chel
Here they come.
Gold is easier to come by than Chel.
the horse is a lie
why do the heroes never get the gold... every single movie or book where gold is one of the goals, they never get it
SERIOUS FACE
evil goatee
its a matter of weight, the boat = not heavy and thus not enough to crash the cave
THE HORSE WILL LIVE!
It's really for the best. The bottom dropped out of CGI-produced gold 3 years later... :P
wow he dead
he's so dead now
if it exists, there is a pony of it...
It's trapped.
I want a srs horse

DSNesmith: Isn't gold a soft metal?
Crossbone: it's bronystate
Narolas lol
QUICKIE TRIVIA: A series of sequels featuring Miguel, Tulio, Chel, Altivo and even the armadillo going after other legends about gold was planned, similar to the Shrek series, but following the disappointing box-office results they were immediately canceled.
And we never saw a sequel
And that's how Equestria was made

Not just any Robin Hood. This one wears -tights-
This i my favorite part of the movie... reading.

Freefall29: So, bascially, a hilarious satire
I Refresh the page over 9000 times and nothing :'( :'( :'(

Power_Of_Chaos_Emera: clear you cache, see if Flash is up to date and set local storage on the video to unlimited
Nel Hooks
I have Men in Tights somewhere on VHS.
Am I the only one who automatically tunes out whenever the credits roll? It's like they have that perception filter the Doctor used in the end of S3.
fluttercry: he makes funny movies as it should be
did we have a Mel Brooks week?
Is season 3 sneak preview next. *trololo*
fluttercry: that means we have a 4th wall that nees reinforcing andf guarding
All the main characters have their own animation team....odd
Meanwhile I have it on dvd
fluttercry: Mel Brooks is best pony.
I'll catch Robin Hood tomorrow. Past 2AM here, getting kinda tired.
SeaponiesofLiverpool: Not with some servers, mods and plugins, it's still fresh

CountDoofus, hahaha your tired now...
http://derpy.me/XJL0Z
love that episode
I miss my childhood
I predict that by the end of the year we will have seen every Mel Brooks movie
Evening, Saigneur
Hey if John de Lancie hates lying in the media, he must hate the CMC in this episode since they're the Ponyville version of Fox News in this episode
so we HAVE had a Mel Brooks week?
How come we haven't had any rumors on season 3 yet?
diamond tiara returns.
heck, the only reason i'm here right now is because it's Mel Brooks
05,15PaladinDrunkenwolf Indeed. AND I SHALL LEAD THE DEFENSE! To arms my brothers! The 4th wall needs us!
Rookeealding: no
Ninjazz: Where did you find that?
other than minimum 13 episodes

Wow, this chat's so fast
Captain_MasterBoss43: Yeah, the middle of the night by being in Europe does that to you.
Freefall29: It's been done already
...maybe I should have waited for the episode to actually start before saying that
Sumica: I've prv messaged you.
Om, once again... I'm okay with this.
I mean wasn't it this time last year that we started hearing rumors of season 2?
what...
Oh, wow. This film was SHORT.
08,01WAFFLES!
I think we did Blazing Saddles within the last 6 months
JESmith71: gossip columnist isn't same as fox news. gossip lie about famous people because famous. Fox lie about everything because power.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Nuuuuuuu, don't eat those chips otakon, you'll make your ass fat, flabby and unsexy
CountDoofus I live in Sweden egghead. -.-
Ninjazz: :D good
Nope.
The Road to El Dorado has a runtime of only 62:14.
This is my first time here.
Yay, I get hug! ;)
IshAztecPony: too late ate some already
oh well. time for ponies
good movie, deserved better critical reception than it got
someone link Crossbone to the youtube of this chat reacting to Derpy Speaks

Wtf is happening to my chat?

I wonder if princess celestia would make a good president
Crossbone is my BRo, don't mess with him kay?
DSNesmith: it was trying TO hard to be Disney and was a little more adult than it should have been
all my bromance
hey GilDash
I didn't really like it that much. Didn't hate it, but I wasn't too impressed
i'm good Saigneur on summer break from college now how about you
Crossbone: new ep streams are an absolute blast. try to be here for them
Haha
otakon's sexy ass for A movie
Rookeealding, yeah but that was because of some leaks from TopDraw animation. they've been very carful since then
Saigneur: Holla! :)
Irish_Pony FTW hi dude
Sure will do
so any way how've ya been Ninjazz
DSNesmith: I love this film. I'm 16, so my idea of nostalgia is anything from 2004 and before.
Freefall29: NASA would be funded pretty well at least
New episodes :( that will take a while
yeaah...
Spectrum_Rush, been better. How bout you? :)
Sigh.. that is a shame... wish there was something rumor wise though
So yeah, I watched this all the goddamn time.
Freefall29: If you know what I mean...
I can't wathc my little pony with this lagg :'( :'(:'(:'(:'(:'(
New episode streams are not that great, too many chatters, good for me though, I don't have cable
We'll new episodes eventually, they're working on it
It would put the fandom in a tissy
SolairePony89: yeah. I know what ya mean. lol
otakon: Agreed. Plus the general mannerisms of the characters, which was the primary source of humor, kind of got annoying after a while
Rookeealding: well itll be all that more epic when i eventually comes to fruition
Ninjazz: 'bout the same :$
I'm kinda worried that season 3 has only 13 episodes planned, it seems a bit short :(
SolairePony89: that joke works better with princess luna
/me hugs Spectrum_Rush ^_^
So narrator time?
Unnr lol
I prefer to be Surprised
Freefall29: But why would Luna want to go to the moon?
i find i tend to get to much lag during new episode streams
Pony Time
Narolas It might change
right, imma go do something till the mel brooks comes on
Narolas: Number isn't confirmed yet
I wish they would anoucne more than 13 episodes at lwast

...Wow. Otakon got booted for spamming while +m was on?
oh god not them
11,01The kick script booted otakon w/o him even speaking.
05,15lol
04Was it magic?
ot
EspyLacopa: You can safely assume that otakon is being booted for spamming at any moment in time
11,01~75 less than usual.
Yeah. I guess messages are sent to the server, THEN ignored if +m = true.
00,10first off we have the a pick
did someone code the kickscript to randomly kick otakon at different times?
04A pick is...
05,15Nah
Jim: You'd think so, wouldn't you?
00,10Number 126 Marx with WarGames (1983)

EspyLacopa: Poor bloke.
I am in for a surprise
Shamroc, you alive?
hmm
00,10any complaints?
11,01How about a nice game of chess?
Check it. http://i.imgur.com/8jvh1.jpg
8,6Wargames is a good one
"any complaints?" *+m is on*
04Wait, is that the movie where the main character plays a video game to decide the fate of the world?
11,01Instead of this movie. :p
total slag
Fun movie. Too bad I won't be able to watch it since I work next Friday and Saturday
11,01Yes.
o dat Meanwhile
Where's otakon gone?
04NICE
00,10yeh
04I was talking about that this week, kinda stoked to see it

ScootaChicken: He was kicked while +m was on.
00,10right then on to B pick

otakon: Way to go.

otakon: Must be some lag.
otakon: Props to you. I don't know how you managed, but that was hilarious.

Pretty big lag over here.
otakon: WarGames for A.
sooooo much lag
that's not POSSIBLE
otakon: A is Wargames
thats some serious lag you have

Otakon, you be laggin like hell brutha
Wargames
11,01He plays a game with an experimental AI that thinks it's real.

RX-78-SweetieBot: THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
otakon: everything is possible
'Is anyone else getting a FUCKTON of lag??!!?'-otakon
04Sounds a bit like Fallout
It clearly is for you otakon
Hey guys, what'd I miss? Went to get me a cold pop
that's it'
11,01And they made an indie game off of it that's pretty fun.
"Thermonuclear War" is worst game
O__o
What're you talking about?
otakon: I assume messages are sent to the server, THEN it checks to see if m = true.
Am I right?
00,10Number 55 xander13 with young frankenstein
I told you about the lag man
Yes!
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT
11,01Awesome.
I love that film.

11,01Ahh!
I love this movie :3
This. Fucking. Movie.

Dave Chepelle b4 he went crazy with his career
Anyways, otakon, you can complain in the channel for complaints instead of here.
I'm really glad I put it in my cart before the rush
Freefall29: what? i am not raging

QUICK TRIVIA: When Ahchoo first appears, he and Robin fight Prince John's knights with a style Robin calls "Praying Mantis". Praying Mantis is an actual martial art - a style of Kung Fu emphasizing grabbing your opponent and bringing him to the ground - but it is nothing like the slapstick techniques that Robin and Ahchoo use.

4th walls never exist in mel brooks movies
Marion... Marion..
I just don't know what went wrong
04Huh...wasn't she in Dracula: Dead and Loving It?
Vordox: Mel Brooks movie, bro, fourth wall doesn't exist
Derpy, operates the Kamera, i knew it
Vordox: it's gonna be in small pieces by the end ofthis.
05,15PaladinDrunkenwolf ABANDON THE 4TH WALL! TIS LOST

CK|Basara: XD
Fun Fact. There is no 4th wall.
We need MEL BROOKS WEEK

QUICK TRIVIA: None of the actors actually sang their own parts. All of the singing was done by professional singers. Debbie James and Arthur Rubin did the singing for Amy Yasbeck and Cary Elwes.
It's not her heart that the key will set free.
04>Maid Marion
Can u hear me ?

The other thing that bugs me about this movie is how cheap the cinematography looks.

har har har
HAHAHA
Lol.
Beat the crap outta them
HA HA ha ha HA
lol
hahahaha,,, i got owned hahahaha
damnit i spilt my beer!!!!!
QUICK TRIVIA: Throughout the movie, a mole on the face of Prince John (Richard Lewis) changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then over to his right cheek, then his chin, then his forehead. It then goes back to the original place. This lampoons the mole on Alan Rickman's face in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. It's also a nod to the famous "I-gor's hump" gag from Young Frankenstein.
Didn't both Austin Powers and Love Guru had mole running gags?
Wow...
Dohoho! That slaps me on the knee! :D
Prince John wasn't really that bad. He just gets a bad rap due to the Robin Hood story and a bunch of greedy lords who forced him to sign a document
Worst fake bad news ever
John is not amused.
Damnit vordox damnit

That night at the castle.
It is.
That was such a cheesy movie.
hahahahahaha ha haha ha.
it's funny because it's true
so how would that scene have played out if Robin Hood was played by a Hispanic?
Dat valet
This is one of those movies that people can quote start to finish isn't it?
NV Isn't much different
that to recieve hate
13it's oblivion minus the color and interesting
God damn this movie
TheXIIILightning: yeah, you'll get your chance soon
Kammerjunk: Ezio > Robin Hood

YOU DO NOT TREET A PONY LIKE THAT
SolairePony89: Well, obviously. Ezio didn't wear tights.
worst mime
Suddenly a mime.
But white men can at least swim
Everything that's gret in FO3 is orange in NV is all.
Even when it threatens his life, Dave Chappell makes white jokes
0,14EVO needs more Ezios
Kill the mime!
I feel like the only one who liked Oblivion more than the rest of the series

13morrowind > *

05,15Morrowind was best
BURN IT!
God damn this movie
Eat him!
Patrick says: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dat mole
Now the mole is on his lip.
05,15I played that game way too much
moop
everyone says morrowind was the best
THANK YOU fluttercry and Shizuka
OW! Ow ow ow... :(
o.o
Damn, is Morrowind GotY on sale?
but I enjoyed oblivion far more
Oh look, her.
DSNesmith: cause it is
No! Kill the Mime!
I love seeing horrible things happen to mimes. it's like they can't complain
13it's a shame its modding engine is crap though... get barely 10fps with the mods i run
if it's under 10 bucks I could get it
He's Molejesty
did he say Lovely Breasts?
Why does she have crown btw
It's the princess.
otakon: not until summer sun celebration steam sale
He let the mime live? He is evil
damn
Its the Mime Assasin!
00,10all the tongue
8,6morrowind let you dick around a whole lot more
05,15If Morrowind goes on sale I will buy it again.
well, I can wait
RRRRavishing
dat guard.
those pickup lines
Now groinkickhim
o.o dat tongue
/me still can't stop thinking of Chel
still, would like to get it for PC
I played morrowind on the old xbox and loved it but had trouble finding my way around got frustrated and never finished it
Looks like skyrim
(I would honestly be amazed if anyone else remembers that webcomic)
kiss
I'll ravish her, alright...
she's Lady Marion, which means she's a daughter of nobility... of undefined rank, but still.
I do like the sherriff's necklace of sherriff's stars.
13see morrowind wasn't fully voiced
well. us geogrians are known to be like that
Unless it's Mime from HTF.
fluttercry: i want it cause it is actually good unlike some rpgs. *cough skyrim cough
13that meant characters could have more dialogue
I haven't seen a good mime assassin since Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars.
a gold goblet would be terrible
Big_Jake-intosh: same here, I taunted people and took their gear afterwards.
Bananas?
YOu like bananas?
13you know, dialogue that was INTERESTING
Love Triangle.
lolol
ai got bananas
Did he said mmmmbananas?
XD
shizu someone was making a oblivion mod to add all the things of morrowind
Bronysith: Skyrim is fun
Mooooooooooooooooonaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
OHOHOH
QUICK TRIVIA: When Robin drops the pig in front of Prince John, Prince John says, "Treyf!" Treyf is Yiddish for non-kosher food.
and a pig.
8,6don't think I ever actually finished Morrowind
DOHOHO
those guards
but as a game it wasn't nearly as good
otakon: nope
04I HAVE A HOG
I have arrived with a PIG!
OMG IS THAT daring do?
Is that a....pig?
Boar
LIKE A SIR!!
Warthog!
Bronysith: it's a little too streamlined to be honest
A boar.
You're keeping the mime alive? HE COULD TURN YOUR VILLAGE INTO BLACK AND WHITE
Pale_Horse: you need to look up the long since completed Casey and Andy
eepples and beneenees
o wait tis a pig
13rather than the same length of dialogue in oblivion/skyrim except it takes three minutes for them to get through it
I LOVED LOVES this movie in high school
dem cleevages
anyone order some... bacon?
otakon: it is so boring
TDO the guards look like the one sin skyrim to anyone else?
How to make an entrance!
LIKE A SIR BOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
13and you're like come oooon shut up already
kirzstryfe: you can't finish Morrowind
or perhaps a large ham?
royal guards have been defeated
I'm sorry
Makin' Bacon
13well you can... i came close

So, uh, Nyria, bout that room you linked earlier...
tis pig a lie!
the shit combat, the awful confusing journal
Boss
I did not like the melee combat in worrowind that hit and miss stuff was bs
Trafe...
That dead thing makes me laugh
I don't eat pig.
ScootaChicken: bad jailbait
I mean, morrowind had good atmosphere
Burn
OH BURN
O SNAP
ScootaChicken: Shut it Nailbait.
Oh burn.
PIG POWER IN THE HOUSR
oh burn
BURN!
but as a game, oblivion is way better
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Mister Smooth
Oh, by the way, HE'S THE FRIGGIN' KING! IT'S YOUR MAJESTY!

QUICK TRIVIA: When attempting to motivate the villagers, the speech given by Robin Hood is a clear reference to two speeches given by Winston Churchill during WWII, specifically the "We shall fight them on the beaches" (given after the British withdrew from Dunkirk) and "Never was so much owed by so many to so few" (given after the Battle of Britain).

THE CHOP
Fillies and Gentlecolts.
QUICK TRIVIA: When the the crowd gives Robin the chop at the archery tournament, this references a tradition at the Florida State University sports matches. The chant is also sung when at FSU games. The chop was also, prior to this film, brought to more focus with the Atlanta Braves baseball fans adopting it to cheer on their team in the League Champion and World Series.

QUICK TRIVIA: The bit where the Sheriff of Rottingham tells Robin to "walk this way" before strutting away, causing Robin and the Guards to follow him strutting in the same manner is a reference to another Mel Brooks movie, Young Frankenstein, where Igor and Frankenstein do the same bit.

AND DERPY........as long as we don't hurt her feelings :(
Waiting for season 3
I wonder if the reason we didn't see Derpy in this is because someone has to deliver the papers
mmm coffee for fillies

Wait, I just noticed that Sweetie Belle drinks coffee

MY LIFE IS RUINED
OH MY GOODNESS
lololol
11,01You got your name in the paper Rainbow!
dat look
its association with the rich is most likely why they chose it for Rarity, as her prim and proper nature is very similar to those of the common mid-atlantic speakers.
00,03Why would a pony need tail extensions...
say it
No, you're not! She kinda is!

Rarity, would you like some hay with your scenery?
Seriously, Tabitha St. Germain is one of the BEST VOICE ACTRESSES EVER
lol
MORNING bronystate ponies :3
It's also notable that Rarity's accent is an affected one, as neither Sweetie Belle or her parents, nor anyone else in ponyville speaks with it. This also fits her character rather well.
13but then we could see a pony doing the zig zag snapping thing
got to say they put it together petty easily
Ninjazz Rarity isn't sad
morning VioletGreySha!
Shizuka: How would they snap?
13exactly!
00,03Et tu, Brute?
