sagas: what did he say
11,01All of the mods are awesome.
twilight_sprinkle: He said he tried it, but it wasnt his thing
02[16:58] <%Espeon> While it's cartoony violence it's still rather violent <-- people learned that the hard way with SNES and 2600
Nittany_Discord: Wrek still scares me... :D
Nittany_Discord: amen bro
11,01Wrek isn't as dangerous as he used to be.
sagas: but he said in an interview that he was
legends of the hidden temple?
GilDash why never seen much of him
*German
twilight_sprinkle: Then he is sending mixed signals!
Meow:3
sagas: weird
I feel SuperBrony64 should stream
Germaneigh?
Wrek is a puppy dog -lol- :D
11,01He used to draw r63 of people that rubbed him the wrong way.
Wrek is like the vogons :)
Sumica: Did you find that Lemonade Bake Mix I told you about?
r u wrek?
Brohoof /)
he has a rough exterior, but deep down, he just wants to be loved :)
step on his tits?
Nittany_Discord isn't really scary but i get the point why he did that
Nittany_Discord: ... I'm not sure that would stop me. :p
11,01Wrek is a fan of Maid Hour. That should tell you something.
what about actual donkeys that get on the stream?
GilDash: Is there ANYTHING that can stop you >_>
I'm not scared of Wrek, silly
<don't hug him>
Om doubt it
<unless he requests it>

12I bought a 32GB pendrive
03not reboot
00,10Ohmy~ dat AJ

03reboot is just Start - Shutdown - Restart
12I think we say reboot
12LOL
12over here
DitzyHooves: I know, right?
12;3
since when is AJ hot?
03no, the term reboot means to restart
03>_>
Since always
DaringDude: since always
What a pose
00,10sence wrek
sumi do you have legends of the hidden temple?
so.. AJ is rolling around in the hay again? :)
i never noticed till now
DaringDude: since ever? Duh.
12its what I say I suppose
12ah well
13I'm not into computer tech, deal with it ;3
02drf, your face
Oh wow... that sexy AJ.....*Drools*
I can say something here that may ruin Wrek's mood. D:
00,10also NSFW: Not safe from wrek
Dat Aj.
12I'll just say WIPE THE COMPUTER
02it need to be rebooted
/me runs
^
00,10No I dont have it
LOL
awwwwwwww
/me pomf
oh goddamnit i cant look. perfect time to get back to studying
do you have Air Gear?
aj is surprisingly hot
^
ikr?
12see I wish in ICT
12we learned stuff like this
maybe just link us a list of what you have?
Its moments like these where I hate being a pegasus
yeah DaringDude
13^
00,10problem was old game shows genearkly were not recorded.
xD
i was like wtf since when?
Guys.... Guys... Guys... I wanna go to ponyville, you all can too! Just hit, control, alt, E. The E is for Equestria.
12like looking inside knowing what the motherboard, processors etc etc
13I did ICT GCSE but all we did was make powerpoints about things I don't care about
13like spreadsheets xD
legends of hidden temple - COMPLETE episodes on youtube
13easy, but boring
No disrespect, Wrek, but I am a pure AJ fan, but I can never see her in this light. Sure it's good and all, but....It's that "wall" that I do not want to, and won't break.
06that's quite different to what we do o.o
03just talk to me enough and you'll know it
THis is awkward because AJ is actually one of my favorites of the mane 6
12we used flash and dreamweaver
Applejack is still worst pony
12and the dreaded excel
alexxm Probably the accent.
Obisidian: Same situation here right now
ooo wrek is drawing
Vordox: yep same here
CupcakeWarrior: :|
/me breaks Vordox's 4th wall
If I was a pegesis... This drawing
Shepard likes AJ though
Really Wrek|Dusty, you decided to stream this>
*pomf*
13ew what, you got to use flash?
AJ is my 2nd fav. considering my family comes from a farm :)
cloplcoplocplocplcopclopclop
Aj is one of best ponies.
13we just did powerpoints all year
06ict here might as well just be called "databases", at least this year.
06all of my why.
Rd then Aj
I'm fine with him DRAWING her though. <3 But I cannot appreciate it
12Onlt a little because we literally had a teacher for 1 whole year who didn't know what we should do :/
Derpy then Luna
12so we had to catch up with 3 years work in a year
the complaints make me lol
dem tapestries.
AJ is 3rd best pony
RD is my favorite mane 6, then Twilight, then Rarity, and the rest are all tied for 4th
EW GCSE ;-;
13in our exam we were actually told what to do LOL
XD
13and anything that wasn't even given to us in the instructions
13the teacher showed us how to do it during lunch breaks
did u kno that Derpy has as much air time as Princess Celestia?
We all know that Flutterhsy is best pony
All of wreks drawings are seemingly perverted...
06lol what.
13so it was really easy, but boring as hell xD
Seemingly?
12ICT
12this is what I did
03we don't even have a class called ICT
serriously DitzyHooves
Are?
yep
yeah "seemingly"
12You had to write about audience, context etc etc for your website for example
12I wrote pages and pages
12so the examiner cba reading it
12top marks ;3
13I remember they told us we got to make our own website
yup..
/me smells tacos
BlazeAngel: -lol- but you have to appreciate the skill. :P
Rarity = Fine, she lives for it's appeal. Fluttershy = No hassle fo her, she is already a walking sex bomb. :P, Twilight = Wish to be seen as, Rainbow Dash = She ever HAD a sexy pose?, Pinkie = Only if it's a game for her.. AJ = Sexy...no? D:
im ok with this
13what they meant was that we made some stupid crappy thing in powerpoint
06we got some topic (in this case a game selling website) and they said "herp derp in 48 hours you need to have a website with a functioning database ready, good bye"
im ok with this too *clop*
Vordox: Fluttershy? A sex bomb?
What?
12what
06I'm not complaining at all but just shows how different it is I guess ,lol
dat sex bomb
wait what?
CupcakeWarrior: The world thought so, remember the Green is not your colour episode?
applejack?
hiya everypony btw
Can i ask a mod a question?
xD
12we got to choose our topic THANK GOSH
Vordox: Fluttershy is not a sex bomb
Vordox surely fluttershys to inocent for that
Bronysith: Yeah...
Wb Bronysith
alexxm: Innocent or not, she still does it. :P
dropping sex bombs, considered making love? or making war?
13we had to pretend we were in charge of some kind of business and we had to find the costs for stuff they'd put in their office etc
hey Bronysith what have you been up to
06at least it wasn't a really dumb topic ;-;
13like hardware/software they'd use
12LOL I did that
alexxm: writing my book
06and asdf.
13and make it intoa powerpoint
Hi Bronysith :P
alexxm: serious book not fanfic
12some murder mystery hotel thing
y no both at same time?
08,01hahaha
08,01my got
12on pp and links to things
08,01*god
whats it about Bronysith
DWR_Drawing: What are you drawing?
13what, we didn't get to pick our topic I don't think
make Love AND war
06that sounds silly but not in a bad way
alexxm: sry. i dont want to give any details
12Only for the website
13I don't remember what we had to do, but still xD
08,01Airpuff: it's terrible and hilarious and horrendous
12what did I do it about?
12anime of course
alright Bronysith
08,01animation quality is pretty cool, though
I wonder... How often is Wrek seen on EQD? D:
Good luck storming the castle!
08,01but my god...
alexxm: just think final fantasy
08,01just...
08,01oh bronies
08,01no.
13OH WAIT I remember now
11,01Vordox: He got one drawfriend that I know of.
ONLY one?!
13our topic was that we were in charge of a clothing brand
RustyMeat: He played the Game
13and setting up a shop somewhere
11,01That Rarity he did on stream made it.
13.w.
12ew
Can I ask a mod a question regarding the newsletter?
BAH! EQD loves Rarity(And Trixie)
00,10my seeand say was broken, my cow went bark bark
08,01my god, there's an scene where vinyl slips you an ecstacy tab...
12I loved my high school i.c.t though

12"sorry can't do p.e, gotta work on my ict work"
11,01Oh well.
12"oh okay =)"
CupcakeWarrior: What are you foal talking about?? -lol
03LOL
CupcakeWarrior oh that i played it too
Iron_Edge: mlp r34 game
12I got the teachers to like me
13I liked ICT mainly because I was with some of my friends in the same class and the five of us sat in the far corner of the room xD
08,01i'm not going to mention it further
CupcakeWarrior: You LIKED that?
I just noticed, AJ's hair is same as Wrek's hair.. O.o The top part
12so they'd let me work with my ict work instead of p.e
11,01Same color at least.
AJ one actually i my fav now
A jazz chicken.:D
BlazeAngel: The Battletoads music was why I liked i
13despite the fact we procrastinated all lesson, we got away with it cuz we were labelled as being well-behaved
A JAZZ SCOOTALOO?
THE JAZZ
13and we did actually do all our work on time somehow LOL
ITS SO SMOOTH
milk me!
00,10You requested a pose like that Nitt?!

08,01oh wait, wrek's streaming?
08,01i thoguht sumi was gonna stream?
yeahy

13getting the teachers to like you lets you get away with anything LOL

Just to clarify ONE final thing about E3, BEST Conference of them all, best part = Rayman Legends ending
Buck you buddy
06imagine if you worked that effectively, but didn't wait until the day before it was due!
/me hides
08,01ah, okay
13Oh we did keep up with our work, we just did it while messing around at the same time :D
12LOL most teachers liked me
Sumica: You know it's around 1.20 AM here in Sweden right? :P
Sumica: Wrek sleeps? What is this sorcery?
12it paid off in the last two years as well
Nintendo made Sony and Microsoft look like Apple during the 90's
03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/funny-facebook-fails-the-problem-with-bars.png
08,01i love the way wrek draws manes
12everyone believed me
00,10yeah
12didn;t have a hall pass?
12no problem, we trust you
12FTW.
13I'm a quiet person in class so teachers always assumed I do my work and I'm a hard worker
13how wrong they were
moo
03as long as you don't look like a murderer
03you can just do w/e
00,10and it's only 4 in the afternoon for me Vordox
12...
I wish I had a tablet...OH WELL! I'll keep to spriting.
00,10sides, i love watching wrek draw.
i wish Wrek had tutorials for drawing =/
13in college I could easily walk into a class 10 minutes late, say "sorry I'm late" and she'd be fine with it
Sumica: I wish it was that time here... ._. got to make a level design before THursday in UDK..
no one expects the spanish inquisitionn!!!!
Darkts3: indeed.. <.<
13if any of the louder people did the exact same thing they'd get interrogated about it :'3
btw Sumica did you find that Pink Lemonade Cake Mix I told you about?
12;3
Sumica: Same, always fun to ...not exactly steal, but get ideas and inspired from Wrek's drawing form
12like a ninja
Sumica: Oh god, its hot where you live
00,10no, but i dont buy cake mix for work.
12there was one teacher I didn't like

00,10actaly it's a nice day today, it's only 85
12I said
STOP THE PRESSES is Superbrony here?
13I went to like 4 General Studies lessons this year cuz it was pointless and no one learned anything
12"oh it's not important, don't add it if you don't want to"
12"alright =)"
I have something amazing for Superbrony
13I think even my tutor thought the same cuz I didn't get bothered about my attendance
/me 11,01stops
SuperBrony64: you here? DitzyHooves has something for you
12the exam consisted of questions such as "what is eBay" (2 marks)
I needs talk to him
hi Angeeeel and Soital
12>_________>
11,01DitzyHooves: A cow?
moo?

Shizuka: But...I grow clovers :'(
Vordox, since she was trying to look nice for someone special ;)
Irish_Pony: Four or Fives?
Rain: That's not AJ... That's the thing. :P
As noticed before, some of her true fans really can't see her in the light
Vordox: lol sometimes when the ponies close their eyes u see they all have mascaras
what makes you say that?
but they suddenly disappear
Vordox: Pretty much all kinds...well hardly 3 leaf those are rare
cachi01: That's the animation decree. You can't avoid that

Nittany_Discord: You honestly thought Wrek|Dusty was drawing a sexy pic of your OC?
08,01it wasn't a freudian slip
08,01it was a typo
XD
suuuuuuureeee
11,01Irish_Pony: I asked him to do a maid version of my OC.
AJ's character doesnt have a special someone though, Vordox
11,01And my pony OC is orange-colored.
08,01Nittany_Discord: if by my boy, you mean Dave (my cello), yes. he is always ready.
Nittany_Discord: And what is your OC anyway?
Rain: Look at AJ's forefathers? :P
if she did, she would be a different character entirely
ok, i've tried to get on the mailing list for the newsletter for several weeks straight, and for some reason, every time ive sent the email, i dont recieve the newsletter. Ideas?
Vordox: =_(\
Rain: AND THAT is why it's not AJ =P
08,01Vordox: i do, and my cello's name is Dave

Wrek|Dusty: We cn hear u

13Unfortunately since the lottery code only goes out once a week plus reminder, you may have to wait until next week to get a lottery entry.
damn i was guessing tensai would have been added to the big show cena match to make it a triple threat Dark92Enigma
13However, our newsletter is always available at http://www.bronystate.net/newsletter
damn it typed it wrong again
alexxm Michael Cole started RAW by saying that If Cena would have stuck up for Big Show when he was fired, he wouldn't be fighting him
RainBroDash: You're a bellend.
inb4 kick
RainBroDash: <3
Ello Olly
watcha doin
Dark92Enigma how bad was the promo

this chat is a fairly silent mofo right now...
00,10dem bedroom eyes
Sumica: Wrek loves dem bedroom eyes.
Ok. Thank you anyways for all the help. Have a nice day.
Well I have to shut down for the night. Bye everypony and good luck with the pic Wrek|Dusty.

Okay, I was wrong, AJ is biting her lip....Wtf. D: My AJ sense is warning
alexxm Ace added that he hereby announces his ''retirement'' from wrestling, so he wasn't an opponent
03OK, that one's back

Princess_Molestia: Just saying hi
alexxm Speaking of Mr Excitement......he announced that Cena's match with Cole would be NO DQ
alexxm IF he would beat Tensai
Hi TSTbot
oh god
how did that go then Dark92Enigma
NO DQ....there will be blood
I wonder if anyone is going to buy the Book of Spells :P

03difference between what
i buy everything that gets me curious
I'll buy it too
13humidity levels xD
whats the book of spells CupcakeWarrior
alexxm: the bad book
damn you, internet. Why u fail
the wonderbook
I see the possibilities of a new type of gaming with that in mind, there's sitll development needed
03ah
the wonderbook of amazeballs
alexxm: This stupid book for the PS Move
03thought you meant between the bots LOL
12do you just type it like it is
03100% humidity in theory would mean you'd step outside and get wet
03but obviously that's not how it works
how bad is it CupcakeWarrior
alexxm while they were fighting, Cole was tauting Cena, thus giving Tensai some leverage
alexxm: Its just really boring
so what happened then Dark92Enigma
>leverage

03so no complaining :P
>Comes in, sees AJ
Me gusta
lol hi FillyFlam
12But thats interesting
well at least we got to see michael cole get beaten up Dark92Enigma
/me 11,01washes FillyFlam
12we just get people who think they can handle guns and gangsta life
12but fail
hey FillyFlam what have you been up to
Nittany_Discord: not dusting? :o
03LOL
alexxm after the letdown.......Cena dragged Cole, humiliated him, dropped some OF JR'S fAMILY BBQ sauce on him
03except here they actually succeed
03by killing people
03x.x
03one of the members of D12 got killed over a game of pool (billiards as others call it)
03so stupid
alexxm: Marching basics and playing exercises blazing fast when we weren't supposed to. :P
http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s83/btk2nd/abandonthread.gif
/me is washed.
11,01cachi01: I don't always have to dust.
12Its probably because they're less strict over there with owning guns
12than here
seriously cm punk vs kane wasn't the main event because of cena Dark92Enigma
Nittany_Discord: u broke the rules now i shall dust you
03people will do it whether it's legal or not LOL
12oh yeah I know
12but just might decrease
worked too well
/me contiunues his pinkie drawing while wrek is drawin
11,01I didn't break any rules.
wish i had a smuging tool for shading
alexxm Cena wasn't finished there – not by a long shot. He proceeded to coat Cole with bottles of JR's barbecue sauce and sprayed him all over with a fire extinguisher. But Tensai came back into the ring and saved Cole from more abuse by planting Cena with a sitdown powerbomb. (Again, WWE)
Nittany_Discord: u broke the rules by not breaking the rules..... i think
seriously cm punk vs kane wasn't the main event because of cena Dark92Enigma
This guy is funny, and that drawing is sensual.
xd
11,01cachi01: I make the rules. ;p
heil Nittany_Discord!
alexxm i wonder.........i guess WWE seriously wants Cena to overthrow Hogan, since the latter is in TNA
BRB going for a lemon potato chip burger
yeah Dark92Enigma
hey everypony! I'm back!
03well given how many teenagers have guns in Detroit
03I question the legality LOL
/me glomps Biglaw
:3
hey Biglaw what have you been up to
Biglaw: wasabi
03they get sold on the streets :/
alexxm (Source WWE) Sensing an opportunity to pull off a massive upset, Cole made the cover but was only able to get a two-count on Cena. After surviving the close call, Cena powered back, pinned Cole and humiliated him some more to the delight of the WWE Universe as the show came to a close.
Airpuff, How ya been?
03I could totally see them selling handguns along with the cocaine :P
/me hugs DuskStarshimmer
I am very glad to say this, My GH controller came back from the dead!
alexxm!
I was gunan hug you next
Dark92Enigma "delight"
/me returns alexxm's hug
<3
/me 11,01rocks out with Biglaw's controller, bashing it to pieces and yelling "YEAH!"
alexxm THIS JUST IN: Next week, Mr McMahon will return to evalue Johhny Ace
I am pretty certain about ONE THING though
12whoa where are your police
12LOL then again
12>police in general
03the police there are corrupted
03well
About Wrek's drawing, AJ's reaction would be
03I honestly don't hate police
03I know like
"Yeah I am liking this drawing." http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111127040034/mlp/images/thumb/4/4e/Applejack_bad_poker_face_S01E25.png/765px-Applejack_bad_poker_face_S01E25.png

alexxm delight MY ASS
Nittany_Discord /)_-
12I don't hate them
03but corrupted cops on the other hand, >_>
/me throws oranges at aa wall
12they just focus on petty stuff
12thats why they're useless
Dark92Enigma thats what i was thinking
/me actually has a bannanna
12ew corrupted cops
12:/
03yeah, Detroit cops suck LOL
alexxm SURE it was good to see Cole get another beatdown but........Albert lost? REALLY??????????
OH NO NOT THE BEES! AAAHHHHH! GAH! THEY'RE IN MY EEYYEESS!
03the mayor was just as bad
03at least he got fired
03after way too long
11,01Twilight loses to bees :<
NICK CAGE STRIKES AGAIN
well at least he might get a proper feud now Dark92Enigma and might get something more than squash matches
02aren't most mayors bad though?
02XD
03uh
03not like this
alexxm or a decent title run.......For TEST!
03he spent a bunch of tax money to buy his wife a sports car
03and so on
02LOL
yeah but which one Dark92Enigma
02inb4: spend tex dollars on a Apple
02tax*
seems quiet
people enjoying eddie izzard?
alexxm depending which championship stays on RAW....the US or IC title?
02Sounds like the stuff they do here
ah ok Dark92Enigma
is superbrony here?
woww
Fail
02it's named New Mexico for a reason
/me flees
according to the nick list he is
night guys
night alexxm
alexxm: may the force be with you
03LOL Nintendo spamming me with E3 links
Finally. Finished Twilight drawing.
Tolerate....tolerate... ><
02Sony ruined themselves this time
...Um.
03I just don't care about E3
Interesting time to join stream, huh?
03hype is annoying
03and can be dangerous in large groups :P
Reikim: eeeyup
http://imgur.com/gallery/1zO2m
02well Sony fanboys can be
alexxm btw, when i said for TEST i meant the late Andrew Martin......
03fanboys of any series
03or company
alexxm Good night, bro!
Night, alexxm
02but Nintendo E3 tends to be safe
03not really
03considering I've seen more Nintendo memes than the other ones LOL
So I'm trying to figure out...if the Nintendo conference is at 9 PDT...then in Eastern, it'll be at midnight?
hey Reikim whats going on today? i started my book
Litwick BTW were you saying something about the Super Mario Bros. Super Show finale?
Bronysith: Just waiting for the Nintendo stream, which I believe is midnight where I am.
03Disney's new diet for kids: No more junk food ads
03There won't be any more candy, sugary cereal or fast food on TV with the morning cartoons.
03gtfo Disney
02Well, only because Nintendo is the first brand people think of when they hear E3
03where did you come up with that?
03YOU might think of them first
03but you're also a fanboy so :P
looks like applejack had a bit too much of applejack :)
In other news, Wrek is successfully making ponies sexy. Again.
02hurr
02at least I'm not a sony fanboy :P
Reikim: its those seductive eyes man
00,10ikr Reikim
Curse you, Wrek! These ponies are just too sexy.
yes you are
:<
02well, I like a few of their things. But some things they do is just stupid
Reikim: well. Wrek|Dusty just knows how to draw sexy ponies
02like what they did at this E3
damn.......gotta find the Mario season finale myself
02EW
03again, >Hype
Hyper?
03honestly, is it that hard to just wait until actual release dates of things before you start caring about them?
. But some things they do is just stupid
wrek, makin ponies sexy since he starteed
:D
06e3 is concentrated hype.
03exactly.
Hype train
03I used to watch E3, but it ends up being depressing LOL
06and this year was borderline painful to watch
03like "OMG I WANT THA-oh wait, 2013?"
also, has a good music and comedic sense
03easier to just not care
03once they actually get close to releasing something, then be excited about it
Heh
I've heard this
06i allowed myself to be hyped up too much in advance once. never again |D
A friend told me this one. A friend I don't see anymore.
Sometimes, the Universe just throws you a freebie.
NOW I GOT WHAT Litwick said.........(Insert Squidward reference) THAT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND
05blaspheme, blasphemyou
02well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD
Eddie izzard is a great comedian
11,01Sexy, why are you ponies?
blaspheverybody
http://imgur.com/gallery/QIzlh
You hype haters
:<
Nittany_Discord because Wrek|Dusty
02Nintendo E3 that is
11,01So much religious humor. :/
06feather-face
Nittany+Discord that, is no typo
Indeed
02floof face
:D
02:3
Nittany_Discord: Loving it :p
03<BlueFlare> well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD <- which is exactly why I don't pay attention to E3 LOL
Religious humour is best humour. Also, is best white noise when writing.
03it's just easier to wait until stuff's official
02well that's true
HAHAHAHA
rested from then on
02but I can't help it XD
i was drawing and that line cracked me up
06and for actual games preferably until they are released.
XD
I can only imagine how good the first batch was.
03yeah
03or at least like, released in Japan
lol
03I remember getting a Pokémon Diamond ROM right away
03to show off
03even though I had no idea what it said XD
02unless it's a Zelda game. Those are always good :P
06as before they are released you'll have a) people who are all OMG IT WILL BE THE BEST THING EVAR and b) people going IT'S TERRIBLE BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLE IT'S ON / LOL BAD GRAFICS / WAGGLAN MOTION CONTROLS etc.
Wrek who is this because this is good entertainment while drawing
*hugs Wrek*
06then it comes out and everyone's confused when it's average and inbetween :3
03wagglan? LOL
06gimmicky motion controls i guess.
Hai
03oh
DaringDude: Eddie Izzard
06a rather common "complaint" whenever motion controls are mentioned
ah
06or the wii is mentioned
03well
02EW not liking a game because of graphics
03Kinect is honestly
03a really expensive webcam
03games that use it are just ugh
03XD
06but it's like 3D
03oh god 3D
Dinosaur bar.
03>total money whoring
Am I the only one who thinks this feels weird?
3D ftw
06if it's used in dumb ways like OMG LOOK WE MAKE HANDS GO AGAINST YOU XD then it's totally bad
sagas: What is "this"?
06then there's actually using it to add something besides that
06a new dimension if you will OHOHO
Oh, RAWRity...
Reikim: Watching Wrek draw clop art
that meanwhile x trixie fic, is VERY well done, everyone must read
03some 3D movies were impressive, most are just gimmicks
hey guys I'm looking for commissions to help pay $200 rent +$200 student loan payment
03and 3DS, I keep the 3D on that thing off at all times
sagas: It's not weird. It's Bronystate. And it's not /quite/ clop.
06and "forced 3D" is just as bad as games shoehorning in multiplayer just because they feel like they have to, even when it makes zero sense and has nothing to do with the singleplayer
Reikim: Ide argue its borderline
Reikim: want a copy of my book if i ever finish it and get it published/copyrighted? lol
RAWRity: Now I have to start an otakon x EVERYTHING fic just to top you.
At least the 3DS isn't forced 3D :D
02Nintendo lets you turn it off
Bronysith: If you manage all that, then yes.
Reikim: too late. I made an otakon x Daribot fic already
Reikim: lol. id get it to you sooner but i dont want to risk copyright skam
03yeah, but 3DS with no 3D is just a DS LOL
hey guys are there any pony travel blogs?
02I like 3D. They don't even charge more because of it. (now that the 3DS is $160)
Otakon vs. Scott Pilgrim
RAWRity: I don't think you read that right. I specifically said "otakon x EVERYTHING".
03yes they do
03DS games were always $30
033DS games are like $50
03*40
03Newer DS games are like $35 but LOL GREEDY COMPANIES
023DS games are harded to make. >better graphics
02harder*
Reikim: lol
03Id on't think so
RAWRity So, what next?
02orly
03it's not like they sit there going "How can we render this on a tiny screen"
06>Call of Duty 4 is still priced the same as relatively unknown, brand new games.
03I think they'd just design it like any other game
pyrocatboy: now I do schoolwork and finish chapter 2 of my MLP fic.
06this almost makes me mad.
AJs left arm seems kinda thin
Otaku x Ascended
and then I work on Camp nanowrimo
03except the fact it's COD and nobody should actually care about it anyway Z:)
03-Z
02no I mean, better graphics than the DS
g'night up
11,01Stop the otakon shippin.
RAWRity: Is that on now?
all*
03the 3DS is like 10% better than DS >_>
03anyway
11,01*shipping
night Chrysalis
WREK, Y U MAKE PONY PORN!?
Reikim: I'm doing it in August, but there's one running now.
Nittany_Discord: Don't worry, it was a one-off joke. We've already moved on.
03plus BlueFlare, the fact of the matter is still that any costs it takes them to make the games are usually offset pretty quickly and the rest is just them moneygrabbing
03It probably costs all of $2 to make one of those cartrdiges
|Discord| because he doesnt care what you think
05DISCORD: Y U NOT KNOW WHAT PORN ACTUALLY IS
RAWRity: I'm considering whether to do the August one...
hiya guys, what's up?
03disc-based games are the cheapest
03stuff like Xbox 360/PS3
Wrek|Dusty: Touche
Reikim: I'd say give it a try.
03if blank DVDs cost about 10 cents, imagine how much they'd be to an actual company
Wrek|Dusty: please tell me that's not what I think it is.
It's not porn, It's Evocative postioning!
RAWRity: Mmm. Depends. I may or may not get the time, but if I do, then I shall.
It's ART, damnit!
otakon what you think it's ?
We gonna be watching the 3DS conference?
it might be, otakon. Unless you think it is an ice cream sandwich. Then its not..
03also look at things like the Humble Indie Bundle, the reason those make so much is because they let people choose what to pay so they AREN'T stupidly overcharging you
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: A pony pinup
Ohai otakon. We just got told off for discussing you. How's it going?
03if companies realized that people don't want to pay $40+ for a game, there'd likely be less piracy >_>
Let me rephrasie, WRK,Y U MAKE SEXY PONY!?
a Applejack pony pinup
Reikim: I say give it a shot. I've done regular nanowrimo 3 years in a row, and it's a great way to move forward with a story.
Reikim: told off? for what?
|Discord|, why not?
You do know
02DS is like 64 graphics and 3DS is almost better than NGC graphics. (I know GC was 480p, but 320p isn't much lower)
Nintendo is actually not making any profit on the 3DS now
03um
033DS is 240
03not 320
its funny cause otakon does not get shipped in it
otakon: You-shipping. I thought of maybe doing a collaborative fic about it. Also RAWRity shipped Meanwhile and Trixie something fierce.
03also I mean the games, not the hardware
02oh, my bad
03Hardware is usually reasonably priced.
oh
yeah
03it's the software that's an insane ripoff
Reikim: oh goddammit
otakon could be one, do you want it to be one ?
03Think about it
and CURSE YOU SWEDISH LAG!
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: no
033-4 3DS games as much as the entire system?
03Yeah right
But they *have* to make the software expensive to pay for the losses on the console
03no they don't
well hey
Ambassador games :D
Greetings everypony.
/me runs
TRUTH
03I'd believe it more if htey weren't multi-billion dollar companies
otakon then stop thinking about it and just enjoy the art
02drf, do you think those games cost $0 to make?
03because that's very obvious proof of them making stupidly enormous profits
salutations ZappyTheUnicorn
/me 11,01dusts otakon
03BlueFlare, read what I just said
06no he doesn't but they don't cost $40
06to make
03per game
02they need to make a profit
03say it costs like a million dollars to make game X
11,01RAWRity: Stop advertising it.
03They sell it for $10 a piece, and 100,000 people buiy it, they break even
03now how many copies of most good games sell
0330 million plus?
Advertising costs too
:p
03and they charge like $40 per game?
anyways
03screw advertising.
03Does Minecraft advertise?
06loads emoney
/me runs
0210 million plus most of the time
03exactly, BlueFlare
03so even if they charged like $1 a game
03they'd make a profit
06minecraft pretty much got free viral "advertisement" anyway
> paying one billion <Dr.Evil> dollars for superbaww ads
03it's them wanting STUPIDLY HIGH Profits, really.
11,01The universe is not going to collapse on itself.
wow, Wrek|Dusty. That hair looks incredible. You have really gotten good with your shading :3
At least they're not Apple Profits
Ahem
03actually they're worse
03Apple sells hardware
03hardware has less of a profit margin
Rain: I agree. The hair does look good
06So, who's worse.
03software is literally paying for code
06Activi$ion or EA
http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s83/btk2nd/abandonthread.gif LOL
03Not sure LOL
02Being a programmer yourself, I would think you would know how hard that stuff is to make :P
Ubisof
t
03they're probably around the same
for DRM
:P
Nittany_Discord: It's supposed to spread out, thus lowering the concentration of energy, thus causing it to freeze over. Right?
03BlueFlare, that doesn't mean I'd charge an arm and both legs though
INB4 Make all the gams free and open source
RAWRity TheGreatAndPowerfulT had raged something fierce. i did ? seriously i can't remember :p
03again, the proof is in the pudding, people will be more likely to buy your games if you make them DRM-free and let them pay what they want
11,01Expansion is actually speeding up.
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: You did argue rather vehemently with meanwhile
Dark energy and all that, if I remember correctly.
03but sadly, there are enough idiots who will pay full price that the companies are still making profits anyway, so they don't care.
i drew a delicious cupcake
/me wubs Alexx
06most people do and therefore the companies keep on truckin'
It's rather sad meanwhile isn't here
He speaks alot of truth. XD
03right
02also, the workers won't work for them unless they can pay them $$$
11,01The thinking is that if the universe has enough mass, it'll slow down under gravity and contract.
DuskStarshimmer: huh?
hay rawrity that was a dam good fic i liked it
11,01But it's on the edge.
03which is also why piracy doesn't hurt much, because of all the people that DO pay
wait, your not my alexmm
11,01But then they found out that expansion is speeding up.
06there's a difference between getting a profit and getting ridiculous profit
08,01is this eddie izzard?
03^
11,01And thus dark energy was born.
11,01Yes.
03if someone's smart enough to figure out a reliable way to get something for free, why not let the?
yes
03*the
03m
So basically we're screwed. I'm okay with this.
08,01hey otakon!
06if a disc with game x on costs 2 dollars to produce and they sell it for $40
03there will always be people who buy stuff anyway
0620x
RAWRity http://tinyurl.com/dx3zco8
06which is WHAT
I groaned at that one
02the store that sells the game take some of that too though
Wrek|Dusty: goddammit Y U DRAW SAUCY PONIES?!
02takes*
03especially now with them cheaping out on disc
03*discs
08,01life is good
03like the stupid eco-boxes with no manuals
03also look at download games
06well of course, but even when publishers, devs, everyone takes their cut
03that's essentially FREE to distrib ute
03:P
otakon, because he wants too
get over it
06I MISS PROPER MANUALS HNG
03yeah
RAWRity i was arguing ? i'm sorry... i have very bad memory...
08,01i do love eddie izzard
03it's why I don't bother buying games now
Rain: damn mixed signals.....:P
06now it's like "Here's how to start your console and operate the menu, good luck"
03there's no real value gained
08,01he has this great sense of what makes the cadence of a word funny
03unlike back with like, SNES
08,01like "spaniel"
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: well, this was months ago
03when you'd get the shiny box and all
06>age of empires 2
otakon shadup and enjoy the ponies
08,01and "bernard"
It's not just the word, though. It's also how he says it.
06>200+ page pocket thing with info on everything
03inb4 PDF file on a CD
06basically free strategy guide
06and no
08,01aye
03well I've seen that XD
03not on games
03but like, hardware
03will have "drivers + manual" on a CD
03to save paper costs
06x3
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I do but I keep getting lag
06it's just not the saaaame
mixed signals? sorry, let me be clear then. People need to get over themselves and stop freaking out every time wrek decides to draw something a little saucy. If you dont like it, just dont watch the stream.
00,10and to think wrek said he's not good at doing hair braids.
03granted online manuals are nice as you can just google them whenever for reference
03rather than trying to dig through loads of paper
Sumica: pffffft.
03but still, it comes across as cheap
03which we all know is th case anyway
03*the
02either way, people are happy to pay, so why not charge $40-$60 for games?
RAWRity I disguised your fic. http://tinyurl.com/dx3zco8
06not saying that all manuals should be damn books of course
otakon switch your ISP then :p
/me 11,01dusts Sumica
Lol you guys complaining about high prices
03BlueFlare, that's exactly their logic >_>
06Blue
/me sneeses
06by that logic Activision could go
/me 11,01explodes
03and then they complain about people pirating their games.
Wii games here were like 70-80$, DS games are 45ish, 60$ish for 3DS ;D
03LOL HML
03go download ISOs already
That explosion was...amazeballs.
03for Wii
03:P
I have once
I actually
03nie
also it's just me or her leg seems a bit long/skinny, dunno
03*nice
ripped my game ISOS
12That pendrive I got today In Argos was £30/40 got it brand new for £16 online
02HML, everything where you live cost a lot
ISOs
06"Oh hey, those crazy CoD fans pay $60 + more for CoD elite, lets charge $120 for CoD because we can"
but
03so did I
08,01oh oh!
08,01wrek!
12was sexy
08,01wrek! i hear your voice!
No wii to play them on
:<
oh darn he isnt here....
And
08,01<3
No dolphin
12argos
12is
12overprices
12as
12heck
so emulation is out of the question :s
12>:/
We heard Wreky?
12*d
03LOL Soital, this is why bulk no-name flash drives ftw
03I got a 32GB for like $20
08,01at least, i think i did
06o.o
12I dunno wtf I bought
looking for someone ?
12but I was told it was good
03there's only a few companies that make flash memory
03"brand" names for those are just tamped on there
03*stamped
o-o
03they're all the same internally
03same goes with blank CDs/DVDs
Soo stupid
Oh
03don't ask how I know this much, I was bored one day
DRF, wholesale epic fail once
03but stuff like Memorex/Philips/TDK and all that
03same exact thing
03just different logo]
12either way
So this big 1liter or something in gallons bottle of water
12I got a pendrive for cheap
12;3
06so it's like the good old
06"those two medicines do the same thing, but this one costs $4 and this one $25"
and back
just wanted to see if meanwhile was here and reacting
was like 3-50 one brand
03LOL
03sorta
03more that if you go to the store and look at brands of discs/flash drives
03likely they're all the same
and the other which was exactly the same but with a different logo was over 4 dollars.
xD
Hello again otakon.
03exception is stuff like Verbatim
03they actually make their own
12oh yeah
Wb otakon.
03which is why I only buy Verbatim

12nope you haven't got a stupid accent XD
DitzyHooves: It's probably just the saucy pony in front of me, but that sounds like the title to a bad porno.
http://i.imgur.com/CIr19.png
pony_5442: to keep the drawer entertained
because he is a brony duh
02then why does most of the name brand cheese in our stores say "made in California"
Playing rainbow factory through the surround sound in the lounge. Whole room is shaking ._.
02XD
DitzyHooves: indeed it sounds like a bad porno
03does it?>
02yep
i come back and AJ looks more sexier =/
we have already converted 40% of the world leadership
skynoob
ottercan is a bad porno
03well
I keep telling you... its Scootaloo in a AJ suit
03New Mexico is cloes to Arizona
02well, not most but more then other places
That's a bow, now.
03everything here comes from Wisconsin
03in terms of cheese
03LOL
03ewr
03close to California, not Arizona
whoa whoa whoa... how did this conversation become about porn now?
12which states would you avoid per say
03Texas
03:P
02Texas
I wouldn't mind that gift.
?
since forever
6I wouldn't really avoid any of them to be honest
12thats okay no offence but I'm not a fan of the accents in texad
Darkts3: DitzyHooves said maid in manehattan lol
Maid in Manhattan was a movie staring Jennifer Lopez
6each is different, there's no real reason to avoid a state
03LOL I just know Texas has this reputation
oh
03but my sister went there and made it back alive, so
6depends on where you go
Wrek|Dusty: is dat a candy?
Am I the only person listening to the stream?
It's actually hilarious
6I enjoyed it
is that a bowtie?
03well
12thats true =)
03I talked to this dude who told me he'd take a shotgun to school with him
03this was in HIGH SCHOOL
03I was like jeez, the reputation is true
I have it on mute.... like all my video games
ScootaChicken: no, but goddammit my stream keeps lagging out regardless
6so you base your opinions on one person's actions
03and apparently nobody in that area had a problem with it
...One of the "good" Nazis.
6but like I said, depends on where you go
6just like any place in the states
hehe i dont get it
02I've been to texas before. Trash everywhere.
03yeah I'm sure there are parts that are fine
03I just know Texas has this reputation of letting people carry weapons everywhere LOL
RX-78-SweetieBot: Hm. I always used to consider watching that.
ScootaChicken go to bed.
liek, nao
Maid_Reikim: im writing the book in the style of game of thrones
6you wouldn't walk into compton expecting a warm welcome, and yet other parts of LA are nice
Maid_Reikim: Do it.
DashWithRainbows: nuuu
ScootaChicken yuuuuuuuusssss
03I know enough about Compton from rap music
03:P
Wrek|Dusty, that bow.. my god. That is so awesome
RX-78-SweetieBot: Too many eps...I can't pay attention to anything over 26 episodes.
Maid_Reikim: Then just watch the compilation movies to see if you like it?
RX-78-SweetieBot: Same reason I can't watch Gundam, as much as I'd like to.
6most people do
6and unfortunately it's true
i really need to improve
Maid_Reikim: gurren lagann for life
ninjazz is still sleeping lol
12LMAO
/me 2has never heard of it :o
Alexx: /)
12whats in WYOMING

sagas: Have you played any sonic games?
08,01sagas: shush you, this is amazing :P
08,01phil collins is best drummer
Sumica: Your cat is named Scootaloo?! I amz jelly
sagas: this is better than the original IMO
Well, I'm back from finishing BG&E.
08,01unless i'm thinking of that other guy
03hm
CupcakeWarrior: A few. It was a bit before my time
Oh nvm then
08,01Sarah: i was once engaged to a girl called Sarah
03problem is, I have to stick to the approved sources
03it's really stupid
His youtube name if FuckBronies, kinda hard to ignore
stop checking out my sister or else http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw947_dickick.png
03she basically gives everybody 4-6 books/websites and the entire thing has to be based on that
08,01cachi_maid01: ooh
sorry, just had to do that
/me 08,01is ignorant
lol
08,01CupcakeWarrior: i knw
I is.
brb
Suddenly voice
/me headbangs
HOT
Phil Collins ftw
SunderlandPony89: sounds like a try-hard.
Alexx: Thats your name irl?
MahBoi777: /)
CupcakeWarrior: yes
08,01it's my anthem.
Alexx: (\
/me burns her hand on her pan
ow, hot
brb getting more lemon potato chip burgers
Kandarihu: IKR
CupcakeWarrior: yes. and molestias is sarah. we are an inet couple
There's really two kinds of trolling. Pranking and bullying.
Rain...you ok?
Wrek|Dusty: add a pole lol
/me 08,01amputates rain's hand and replaces it with a robot hand WITH LASERS
hm
Chat derp
08,01pew pew
Alexx: So how old are you?
Well, time for me to go. Night everypony.
/me was making a joke about this being hot
CupcakeWarrior: 18
night ZappyTheUnicorn
hawt
Rain: went RIGHT over my head
Kandarihu: I wouldn't even call bulliyng trolling. Bullies give trolls a bad name
night ZappyTheUnicorn
I like the music sound of the chorus, but not the lyrics
gnight ZappyTheUnicorn
Night night ZappyTheUnicorn
08,01Alexx: d'aaaaaww
I just finished Beyond Good & Evil for the first time a few minutes and feel like I just got the former.
Wrek...Your choice of music right now AND the AJ Pose... :P
brb im making a lemon potato chip burger
That is one attractive Apple Jack
Chat derp over.
08,01you so young!
cachi_maid01: Bring me some!
/me 08,01trololo
AND now my sprite is done so I can go to sleep XD
http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/9346/customajspritecowboy.png
I want my gf to be a bronystate regular though :|
I'll keep to spriting, much easier for me then freehand drawing. <.<
Well, they certainly consider it trolling. The bullying kind of trolling is intentionally doing what they can to hurt their target's feelings and getting them to react.
Wrek|Dusty, you have some work to do on the ponytail hair
Vordox: Personally I find freehand eaasier. Anyway, to be honest, the sprite could still use some work.
Vordox: spriting ftw
00,10shinny
So shiny 0_0
nice job
Reikim: Like whut?
Great. Now she looks oiled up
00,10belly rubs =p
Oil is sexy
Reikim: Like the Joints, or the hairs, or?
/me rubs Sumica's belly
CupcakeWarrior: Agreed
08,01belly rubs for everypony!
O_o
Kandarihu: Well, they're wrong. Trolling is NOT bullying, and those who think so are morons. Pranks are harmlessfun. Bullies are anything but
I no like belly rubs. Way to full right now.
My belly is ready!
/me 08,01squeaks
Vordox: A bit of shading would touch it up nicely, and maybe have the irises a bit more centred in the eyes. Otherwise, though, it's quite good. Better than anything I've ever made :D
im back with mah burger :3
My pakage arrives at 7o'clock at night.wow
/me rubs Om's belly
mooooooooooooooo
SunderlandPony89: bullys is like an HIV it is contagious and mostly spread by dicks
cachi_maid01: mmmmmm Burger
I was looking more for a back massage, but a belly rub works too!
SunderlandPony89: i mean STD
I wonder if I will ever find someone who will love me...
00,10fitting music.
Who is being bullied?
CupcakeWarrior: >.> nein
03Oh
Reikim: Hmm.... Shading with only 2 colours? Isn't that...impossible? I'm trying to use the Colour Scheme of the MLP FIM stye
03my
03god
/me 08,01gives otakon's belly rub to Wrek
03This explains why nobody signed up for this :"|

HOWDY YA'LL! (agian) I went away for a while. My computer was derping so bad I couldn't even say bye :(

08,01sagas: come over to scotland, then
she looks like a bunny :3
howdy Ponies47
08,01i'll give you a back massage
If I would touch up the image, it'll take me another hour and I'll add double the colour scheme, but that's not FIM style =<
Game Over Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah
08,01\o/
Vordox: Well that's kind of the thing. If you want tips on MLP style, though, I suggest going over to the Fighting is Magic site and looking at some of their stuff. Long story short, it's epic.
Hiiyo Ponies47
08,01i used to work as a masseure
08,01but you all already knew that, i'm sure
I didn't
/me 08,01hugs CupcakeWarrior
my god, leave room and then come back to one of my more favorite songs :3
Sumica :|
I don't know anything about anyone, except Nittany likes Maids
03ugh
08,01Sumica: but, but... can i molest mods?
Sumica, it's not molesting if they ask for it.
03fricking A LOL
Sumica: awww, why not?
11,01I also like to explode
11,01.
just cover your eyes
and take pics
/me molests molesters
00,10it is if they are under age Reikim
Kipkat07_USAF: u might some day
ZOOM!
Reikim: Oh yeah, I see what you mean now.
Cobellanez: I like ponies. :) There now you know somthing about me :p
dari is best lemon
02looks like a Zelda boss
/me runs
Reikim: You meant the colour balance of the BG flash parts.
So do I :<
08,01Y'HEAR THAT WREK, YOU'RE NOT UNDER AGE, SO HE SAYS IT'S OKAY!
Vordox: Yeah. Don't worry too much about it, though; the Fighting is Magic team is incredibly professional.
looks like BlueFlare's wife
:D
/me 08,01sniggers
03haha
So who's streaming Wrek?
Sumica: Forgot how many of us are underage, haha./
Can you guys help me out and report this user http://www.youtube.com/user/fuckbronies?feature=results_main
03OK that was unnecessary, but I laughed
03sorry
08,01wrek is coming to BUCK
02:|
Reikim: It's jsut ONE sprite I made out of nothing :P
Ponies47: saucy pony? it's Wrek|Dusty

Ponies47: yea
08,01i plan on giving him the best hug
03yeah I should probably you know
03do my job
03as mod
03LOL
Animating the sprites is...something completely else. :P
hehehee
:<
03but I do admit that made me laugh, I'm a horrible person
Vordox: Yeah, and it's pretty good.
we suck
!pokemon
i love you music so much Wrek
03still no bot
;v;
10Yousuck
Vordox: I'm just pointing out places to improve in the future.
suckyou
MahBoi777: probably not. Ive wasted the 14 years on this earth fucking around and not doing shit. I wasted my life and its too late to fix it. If I died noone would care.
03I'm sure you want to
00,10it's euro for snickering Biglaw|Maid
Ive never felt this way about AJ before 0_0
10Yep
Reikim: I'm not a spriting artist. XD
Sumica aahhh okay
08,01oh, you call it something else in the states?
Kipkat07_USAF: dude u r 14 u didnt waste ur life xd
08,01well, i never!
08,01i learned a new word today
goddammit my net just slowed for some reason
Right, off to supper for me
08,01"snicker"
00,10snicker=snigger
See ya
The Wikipedia article on Trolling pretty heavily represents the "provoking a reaction" aspect of trolling.
02oh well
10and y- nah
02my body is ready
Vordox: Well, no reason to try harder, right? I'm not a real artist, but I still like to get criticism.
08,01we have a chocolate bar called "Snickers" over here
/me RUNS
10for drf
no
00,10we have it too
NO
08,01do you have it in the US?
/me runs more
11,01What does Cobellanez like?
08,01oh, nice
Of course
03...
the wikipedia article for trolling as a troll itself
08,01i used to hate peanuts
03well
08,01but now i love them
Vordox: I mean, no reason not to try harder anyway
03at first I was going to laugh
Reikim: Thanks for the pointers...I'll touch it up :P
Kipkat07_USAF: well I've spent 19 years, so don't feel bad. imo, it doesn't matter to me if I find someone or not:D
I like making people hapy
happy*
but then u took an arrow to the knee Sarah
00,10seeing as Mars corp is HQ is in the states
I hate caramel
03as I saw this
03> I'm sure you want to
03<Skylands> Yep
03<BlueFlare> oh well
03<Skylands> and y- nah
03<Skylands> for drf
My favorite candy is Twix
unless it is in a snickers
10lol
Maid_Discord: yes
08,01i've no idea where they're from
11,01Cobellanez: Yay *dusts*
lolwut
Vordox: To be honest, sprite art is actually much, much harder than freehand. What you've accomplished is still very impressive.
00,10caramel is just almost burnt suger.
08,01Wrek|Dusty: when you're in the UK, you shall receive back massages
08,01and you may hold me to that
Sumica: Dont insult Val like that :P
CupcakeWarrior: I love Twix
11,01Don't tel Val that. =p
urgh
stupid venus transit
hurry
cachi_maid01: I never did sports, I never tried in school even though I have the IQ just short of genius, I am too socially akward to talk to anyone and I fuck every conversation with a girl up.
03hey um
Sumica: melted sugar
03how do you pick premade slide templates in Office 2010
Reikim: I've been spriting on and off for over 10+years...
:s
So some has rubbed off, but I only do my own style.
03rather, PowerPoint
Use the ribbon
I've tolorated so much hate in the past year, I have to let it out some how
:}
08,01Kipkat07_USAF: try with guys, it's easier
03I know in 2000, you'd do file-new and it would let you pick
You should see my game in the making I've had for some years. :P
I would like to burn sugar one day
03I know I've done it before, forget how though
11,01Kipkat07_USAF: Not too far from that.
Who said anything about Val? Caramel is nasty imo, unless it is in a snickers bar
08,01trufax.
03yeah but where in the ribbon :P
Kipkat07_USAF: So was I, but I still got a girl
I can't help
Kipkat07_USAF: dude u have a whle life infront f you 14 years is nothing u will improve
> Libreoffice
00,10nah melted suger is white still
02Make your own template like a boss
/me runs
03dude
03presentation in two days
03I'm lazy
11,01Thought I've asked a girl now.
00,10caramel is just before it starts to burn
So, I wonder what Apple Jack is going to be laying on.
03but
Vordox: Earlier point still stands. Spriting is incredibly hard compared to freehand, because you're restricted to the pixel grid. I'd probably have developed a game much earlier, except I get stuck on the sprites -.-
03can you make me a website template plz
/me runs
08,01the radio can give us love
not to mention the coloring they add, Sumica
Kandarihu: You :P
02LOL
03no I'm serious
08,01Kipkat07_USAF: fair enough
03I want to make a website about my radio show
03need some sort of template
00,10nah the coloring comes from the almost burning.
/me 11,01washes Wrek|Dusty. Stop being dusty.
10uh
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramel MADE BY HEATING ANY VARIETY OF SUGARS
02I would consider it
10File
Reikim: Well I prefer pixel per pixel in smaller format, not in 256+ spritesizes. XD
10New
Maid_Discord: O YOU! :D
I'd imagine it might be a bale of hay, or even the canopy of an apple tree.
08,01BANJO!

Hello
"errrr ponies dont usuly wear socks.."
The_Pony_Guy: HEY! Welcome!
The_Pony_Guy: Ignore the stream for the moment :P
Didn't they pass something else that was like SOPA but not? :/
I watched because I was expecting it to take a more decent direction. I wanted it to merely be Apple Jack laying chest-up on the canopy of an Apple Tree.
o hai The_Pony_Guy

Kandarihu: Same here, but tolerate.
Also why is the chat updating in chunks for me? Anyone else got this going on? :|

hen3ry: who needs logic?
The_Pony_Guy: We usually do alot of things here, streaming anything, and heck, Wrek teaches quite a few how to draw good here for those interested.
hen3ry: it's more of a matter of sexual attire.

RaveBrony: What is this...Photoshop I hear about? I only use Paint. D:

08,01RaveBrony: too expensive?

00,10Vordox you must have some great vision or your brain is filling in what you want to see.
hmm not sure yet
08,01RaveBrony: do you have a DA?
11,01If you die, I'm right. If not, you're right.
This song is sad.
might just list on craigslist in a different city
Sumica: Is he thinking in 8-bit? That can do it for you.
Sumica: Nah, I have pixel eyes. I see pixels when looking at art.
DaringDude: okey dokey
A sideeffect from drawing pixels for ages...
Is craigslist trustworthy in your area?
Nittany_Discord: Hmm... AGREED
yeah
Almost everyone has a DA. w
I always hear stories about that site
just gotta know how to buy and sell.
Nittany_Discord: Now you just need pure sunshine.
My sister goes on here,you guys know her? :)

00,10sadly i played alot of doom on an apple 2e wiith no sound
This sounds like Doom music or something
08,01Vordox: we should
I prefer the more known one, the hell gates one
Applejack in Fishnets?
A sec
00,10yeah it's doom
08,01as classic PC games are really the only ones i'm familiar with
girl*
Stallion_of_War: YES
00,10only like updated
Sumica....missed out on SO much without the sound
Capn_Gavn: LOL
08,01Sumica: no you didn't
Am I the only one who could never beat the last group of level of Doom by myself?
08,01Apple 2e never had a doom port
00,10there is a reasion i hae headphones with enoug cord to reach the back of a PC now.
Nice bass

00,10no I did't take it as such
00,10and truthfully Tribes was more fun in highschool then doom

mitamaking: But it says on the front page. And on the Nintendo page. And on the E3 page...
Games still are Wrek...

mitamaking: Of course they went to E3, their press conference was earlier today
It's called "indie scene" take a look
Wrek|Dusty: i miss super nintendo
Not the eyes
all games suck now apparently
Quake was best game in my time

Reikim: Them and Microsoft no E3 pressance at all

DaringDude: Yeah.
oh.
aha i know this song
Midnight_Tempest: eeeyup /)
Many, many generations ago, the celestial sisters, Celestia and her sister Luna ruled from a castle (now ruins) around the much smaller Everfree forest after putting an end to the chaos brought forth by Discord. Eventually Luna grew jealous of her sister and was banished to the moon. Celestia went into a deep hibernation, her energy spent from the fight with her sister, leaving earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi to fend for themselves.
huh
Oh shit whats this?
DaringDude: I do too
Ah i still have to add you sometimre
(\
*Puts a lego city on table* *Flips table*
Midnight_Tempest: Normally there is one announcement
COMMAND AND CONQUER!
DitzyHooves: dat wall

MidgetBrony: I heard a new Rayman game was announced, which made E3 this year awesome
Athgaar: you play much?
Dizty

Oh goddamit.
Klapescki man...<3 dat Command and Conquer Soundtrack
Wrek|Dusty: Oh my

I was all psyched for Nintendo's E3 presentation, and I miss it.
LIBERTELL!!!
SunderlandPony89: A sec

DaringDude: yes, almost every day
Reikim: Nothing of importance was announced
08,01dat BUCK

mitamaking: Well damn. So much for that.
Nice ad for BUCK
Orly? Well, at least they are making another one considering how poorly Raman: Origins sold
ohhh that sexy AJ needs more RD
mitamaking: Then again, E3 in general tends to suck, so...
The History of Ponyville: (1) Many, many generations ago, the celestial sisters, Celestia and her sister Luna ruled from a castle (now ruins) around the much smaller Everfree forest after putting an end to the chaos brought forth by Discord.
Reikim: you play alot too lvl 30 i presume

DitzyHooves: will u stop
DaringDude: Nope! Only level 13/14
I don't get the E3 sucks camp, normally it is pretty good
lol
Stallion_of_War: She's not yours
Rayman Legends better not be a Wii U exclusive...
what I can only write 1 sentence?
11,01Games don't really suck. Game publishers make them suck.
Athgaar: whats ur gamertage
The only thing that sucked at E3....
Athgaar: Luna's mine...
i mean name
Duuuudeeeee....
Nittany_Discord: i love valve
Was the book-game...

03is it just me
>:C
This is so wrong on so many levels X
DaringDude: same name I'm using here
dat commie symbol?
Just not this year, unless you are Ubisoft, then you can beat the big 3 and win
03http://www.pritzkerprize.com/sites/default/files/1989-p-lg.jpg <- or does this guy have hipster glasses
XD*
8,6You're not contributing to the conversation, you're copy-pasting
Okee
Vordox: and i love it
I guess you guys DONT wnat to hear the history of ponyville
mish: The book game was EPIC :P
00,10and then AJ realy liked helping the ponyfokes out

Wrek you going to put this one on DA?
Sumica: i wonder how?
lawl, Sumica
I asked if you guys wanted to hear about the history of ponyville, and you guys sesaid y
Um, okay.
DitzyHooves: im pretty sure there is an episode of mlp on that so im good
if it dint cost so much...If i want to enjoy mah books, im not paying 40 bucks for em'
ME GUSTA
I mean Ubisoft is making all the good looking games this year
....bits....
not exactly
So anyway, I miscalculated, better sleep so i can get up tomorrow. Night everyone.
08,01night Reikim
its jumbled across a few episodes
Night Reikim.
Reikim: pierce the heavens with your dreams
Night Reikim

gnight Reikim
Night night Reikim :)
nigght Reikim
WHat if
08,01Reikim: sod that, pierce my dreams with your dreams
08,01i need the company
8,6no, you asked if everyone wanted to hear a story, and everyone pretty much ignored you
the first episode, Hearth's warming , and Family appreciation day
Why did Nintendo not show Platinum's new game, or Game and Wario
08,01hurr hurr
This saterday...there was a new episode?
/me 08,01explodes, then explodes again
I thought so
people said 'yes' meanign they wanted to hear the story
02*WB03(MysticLugia03)02WB* - <MysticLugia> 12And even with help, I am yet not able to get that what I want
/me explodes
And Sony, nothing on the Vita?
I need to go to bed folks. Good night!
11,01Kirz|Art|DND, your colors are hot.
I assumed
08,01Bronysith: apparently so
And microsoft, you are a joke at this point
night Everlasting_Joy
gnight Everlasting_Joy! sleep well
08,01CupcakeWarrior: Pinkie Pie, of course
11,01Bronysith: Valve is an exception.
GNIGHT EVERYPONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL and pierce the heavens with you passion
it was a reasonable conclusion
Nittany_Discord: If Valve could count to 3...
red alert
11,01I know.]
Nittany_Discord: they make high quality games. but cant count to 3 lol
I am so happy
gnight Bronysith
Whoa, While I was gone, Kirz|Art|DND changed his colors. And he is playing DND. I should totally join him
*explodes* *explodes agian* *explodes agian*
8,6DitzyHooves, between the time you logged onto the channel and the time you pasted your textwall, nobody ever typed the word yes
08,01not as strange as mine, i'd wager
Night, Bronysith
My gamecube is officaly a collectable!!
All Ahil the Solar Empire!!!
11,01Then again, there's a problem with sequelitis.
So is my gamecube game collection...
mish: how?
Night night Bronysith :)
11,01Everyone else can't stop counting.
Did you hear?
yes they did...
DAT sun.
I don't mind sequels, what is wrong with sequels
Screw the solar empire
Nittany_Discord: good point. i love l4d2 and tf2 im fine if they dont make sequels
AJ is best supporter of the Celestian legion troops
Nittany_Discord i found a solution, let them make another half life and call it episode 2.5
08,01Descent 2 was a good sequel
Nittany_Discord: I'd still probably end up playing Assassin's Creed 23
mish: tell me please
00,10clestial comunisum
They are collectbles now...you cant buy them anywhere normal expect online or at a pawnshop
I ask "hey guys do you want to hear an amazing story" and "yes" came after that
11,01Sequels seem to be a cop-out now.
Gamestop wont sell them anymore
08,01the derpies?
Wrek is REALLY breaking AJ's back here. D:
I have been playing SuperBrother's Swords & Sworcery. It is rather good.
sell what mish?
Wrek|Dusty: Is she supposed to be laying down?
not really, Vordox
Gamecubes, gamecube games, or gamecube acceries
that pose is easy to strike >_>
edible pony panties and socks
You know a new 3-D Mario game makes me happy, a new Zelda makes me faint, it is yearly sequels, like NSMB, CoD, or Madden that are the problem
Halo 2 Was an amazing sequel
DitzyHooves: lolno
well
Halo 1 was better
GNIGHT EVERYPONY
with something to lean on as is implied, that'd almost be comfortable
00,10*cough cough* picks or it didi't happen
dat +b
mish: Wait what!? I sold my gamecube like 2 months ago!
11,01I should leave the "problem" of sequelitis be I guess.
OH NO!
Jaketehsnake: what do u think of Halo 4?
Rain: Yes really, check the Forceps to the cortex, then follow the spine to the tip of the hip, where the tail is where the tail goes through the air thereby pushing her back up in the air without any suppport I call that breaking the back
LAWL
That hat <3
08,01what music is this?
Dont fret Flootlah! buy it on ebay or online
There's an invisible thing to lean on
Dat Ban
I mean Halo 4, GoW 4(both) are a stretch in franchises that were suppose to be trilogies
Athgaar: No there's not =P
dat hat
Wait. AJ is a communist now?
/me tries to find her cam to show sumi
Vordox: It's implied, but he's too lazy to draw it.
MahBoi777, I don't know what to think. I think they are strchinbg the Trilogy. I'll give it an open mind, but I am not expecting much.
I kept mine....
there's a GoW 4 comin out?
00,10^_^
the communist hat looks sexy on her though
Athgaar: It's not implied...she cannot LEAN against anything in that position. :P Anatomy.
mitamaking: Theres gonna be a GoW4? Wow. That's stretching it a bit.
MahBoi777: A prequel to the series
God of War 4: The Quest for More Money
Vordox: Hang off of, whatever
/me 11,01dusts Sumica
Well they are both prequels
And din't use it after I got the wii to play GC games on...But I keep mine in the GC box 24-7
Stallion_of_War: This
;___;
MahBoi777: And it's being developed by People Can Fly, who should be making more Bulletstorm DAMNIT
/me cant find her cam ;___;
God of War and Gears of War are both getting prequels
I got the Humble Bundle V. Best bundle So fat.
far*
You know what I want?
SunderlandPony89: I thot that was DLC
evening, everypony! :) How are you all tonight?

Orginal games....or at least good sequels
FIGHT WIN PREVAIL
Well, I'm going to go play Assassin's Creed II
08,01C&C!
08,01 \o/
Sylandest: Evening! I'm good how about you?
The only new game at E3 that looks great are P-100 and Watch_Dogs
11,01More innovation.
MahBoi777: Bulletstorm has DLC already, whati needs is sequel
Sylandest: doin great, how are u?
11,01Sequel or new IP.
/me hugs DeathStar, MahBoi777, FlootahShy
Sylandest, I am doing well. Playing some indie games thanks to Humble.
MahBoi777: im good, if a little sleepy, lol. But good
/me hugs Sylandest back
Nittany_Discord: Depends on the sequel, look at Kirby Epic Yarn
/me returns the hug.
Jaketehsnake: nice! :D
11,01And stop shoving Kinect and Move down everyone's throats (looking at M$).
I like this smusic
AJ is best Communist
SunderlandPony89: nah I mean the GoW Judgement thing
getting to be about too late, Good night :)
MahBoi777: I see AJ being drawn. I'm officially happy
hello all.
Infact, I have an extra code set for Humble Bundle. What should I do to decide who earns it?
MahBoi777: Ah. No, I think it's suppose to be a full game
Nittany_Discord: The kinect isnt even that good
Sylandest: I am not D:
WallDives: howdy! :)
There was Sony Move at Sony's press conference(besides the Wonderbook)?
Sylandest: LOL yes
Vordox: :P
00,10"happy"
MahBoi777: Remember how Nin reacts to Rarity? :D
11,01I don't mind the Kinect. It's just that M$ is shoving it down everyone's throats.
YES xD
Has wrek drawn saucy Pinkie yet?
I am over Kinect
Well, I will be making my leave now. Have a great night/day/morning everypony!
05so

MahBoi777: yeah...thats me for AJ...XD
05NOSTALGIA
05AT 6AM
Jaketehsnake: being deathstar contest?
bye FlootahShy!
Kinect needs a controller
And nethier Acutal imploy many of the kintecs good traits
Wrek: Don't remind me of the time, I haven't slept for over 29 hours now ><
05hah
Vordox: Go to bread
05lightweight
I still want Steel Battalion...
11,01And their "Pay for everything" X-box Live service.
I CANNOT SLEEP! I'm TRYING to sprite, but Nostalgigasm thanks to Wrek. :P
This happens with the wii as well, but it holds up with better uses
You have an unfair handicap. I don;t know if you win or if WallDives wins this one...
?
Nittany_Discord: They just want to give people a reason to buy it since there's no reason for any core gamer to aactually get it. Granted, Steel Battalion looks pretty good and it's a Kinect exclusive. Not enough to get me to buy a Kinect though
Nittany_Discord: How about Sony's online?
OH THIS <3
Commando?
11,01PSN is great because of free online gaming. Massive plus.,
No, this is a NOD Vibe...
^
11,01No fee for it.
^
Whats this music from?
11,01There's PSN+, but that's for extras.
ugh, PSN...
CupcakeWarrior: Original C&C
DeathStar, I think you have an unfair advantage, but its a tie between you and WallDives
Ah
6_9 I accedently closed this window
11,01Not to do things like use Netflix, which you need another fee for.
dat bass
Nittany_Discord: And then MiiVerse, too early still?
Jaketehsnake, what are you talking about?
08,01i love AJ's tail
and what did I do?
WallDives, You Tied DeathStar in a Being DeathStar contest
08,01so 90s
I am okay with Netflix being seperate
08,01Vordox: er, what?
MERCY!
00,10I realy like her "tail" too
Jaketehsnake, how? I dont dance.
I jsut hate Hulu Plus
WallDives: you're amazing
08,01i dun geddit

wow wrek is still drawing
/me takes DeathStar and dances with her
/me dances with CupcakeWarrior
08,01Om: well, i like other parts of her too

/me gently tugs on Sumica's tail
I really like her.... mane?
/me Dances with DeathStar and WallDives
DAYUM
08,01Vordox: well, yes
/me refuses
11,01A cheap netbook doesn't cost much more than a new 360.
I'm quite fond of all of her
I am so cleaver quoting the show
This song is so epic
WallDives: Havent seen you around very much lately
mitamaking: I Like it.................it i...i i i i i ASS!
Om: As I am too
Om: gone fow a few days.
Hey Saxy
Vordox: Tsk Tsk
Sylandest: ello ther
11,01XBL shouldn't have a mandatory fee. Not a shared opinion.
I have never heard this song :$
Wait, No Mercy was in Red Alert.
WallDives: I noticed
Om: howdy! :)
no no no no mercy

Nittany_Discord: Indeed
0,14oh hai folks

sup Saxy.
Nittany_Discord: There is a free option, just no playing
00,10hi saxy, check out the saxy
Om: this drawing makes my night for sure
11,01The free option is pretty useless.
Sylandest: Oh yes.
Saxy Applejack is best applejack
/me checks out the SaxyPretender
howdy, SaxyPretender!
seems to be in good condition
/me 11,01checks out the SaxyPretender

Hey SaxyPretender :)
Whos got Two Thumbs, is 14 and Has a job interview on friday?
THIS GUY
SaxyPretender: I know. Its amazing
Jaketehsnake: AJ?
grats jake, gl
....
Okay this guy has to be trolling
Who
CriticKitten: Nope.
CriticKitten?
I hear that Janitoral work in local fast food locations is quite rigorous in its training and skill set.
Because a lot of us are enjoying this
CriticKitten: Wrek aint trolling, he just draws some really saucy stuff
/me noms on CriticKitten
CriticKitten: who has to be trolling?
Wait, am I the troll?
CriticKitten: That is a Saucy AJ, which had different reactions on people liking it and people disliking it. :P
This guy claims that Sony's Brawl clone ISN'T a Brawl clone. Oh no. He claims they based it on Dissidia.
ALL the ping for you CriticKitten
lol
CriticKitten: oh derp XD
what's this? Wrek|Dusty actually drawing an applejack?
lol
CriticKitten: hahahahaha!
CriticKitten: Dafuq?!
CriticKitten lolwut?
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT? I mean, who wouldn't see the glowing similarities between All-Stars and Dissidia.
Dken2021: ikr?
CriticKitten: Isn't it closer to Dissidia's fighting style to be fair
mfw wrek never drew saucy RD
Dken2021: shush. I'm enjoying this
00,10realy when did Dissidia get 4 player and super smashhes?
CupcakeWarrior: He should fix that. Soon.
or a story in singleplayer?
Sumica: When it went to the PS3? Spoils for future game
For example, Dissidia is 3D and All-Stars is 2D. Dissidia's gameplay involves dropping an opponent's HP to zero, All-Stars focuses on stage knockoffs.
fighter oversaturation makes me sad.
TOTALLY THE SAME
SunderlandPony89: i was drawing a nice RD then i got sidetracked and started drawing pinkie again
Sumica, Ever since Miyamota grew a moustache and shat a pony.
A story is exclusive to Brawl now?
MFW Generals USA theme...
08,01what's this?
It was a saucy one too
DaringDude: Nooooooo! Finish that best poni drawing!
08,01and for once, a real orchestra
guys smash bros is based powerstone so stop being silly
08,01i even hear some col legno in there
and thats all I have to say about that right now.
This sounds amazing
08,01anyone know what col legno means?
mitamaking: Wat, it's barely even remotely similar to Dissidia.
RustyMeat: Didn't Smash start as Powerstones?
why blue
mitamaking, no, it started ad erghiez.
08,01Nittany_Discord: rub me?
CriticKitten: I've only play Dissidia once to be fair, sorry
I would play C&C but I doubt my compiter is good enough
08,01sure, go ahead
pretty sure sure powerstone came before
cant spell it, dont care.
SOX plz
/me 08,01builds up a static charge
SUS
They all are ripping off Joust anyway
What song?
hello ponies :3
hai HowToFryChicken :D
why blue
Im halfway through with my nightmarish political speech essay i have to present tomorrow.
Blue is the new Sexy
mitamaking: The one common thread between the two games is a meter that charges up your badassness. Which is a mechanic that exists in virtually every JRPG in the last decade, among other titltes.
Athgaar for shadow I guess?

08,01as you can tell, i have a bit of a grudge against my mother tonight
05that'll do
08,01after The Cheese Incident
O-o
Cheese Incident do you speak of?
... dare i ask what happened?
cheese incident..? >w>
08,01HowToFryChicken: you didn't hear about the Cheese Incident?
or will it bring back full rage mode?
nope
i haven't been here for about a week and a half
HowToFryChicken his mother gave him rotten cheese, says it's ok to eat
probably goes well on noodle incidents
tell me
ok..
/me 11,01throws Wrek|Dusty
THROW THE CHEEEEEEESEE!
/me throws cheese
...?
/me throws the cheese
/me could totally make a cheese referance but is to lazy to change /nick
Rain no no no , we're not starting with those asdf references please.
yeah to ded
08,01okay, so i was over earlier, and my mother decided to make English muffins (non-sweet) with cheese in them
the cheese throw has been doubled
mmmmm cheese
HowToFryChicken, get over it
Yum
08,01upon biting into the muffins, i noticed a funny taste
CHEESE FOR EVERYBODY!
08,01a funny, mold like taste
Rain: cheese throwing ftw *brohoofs*
Rain: Those movies used to be funny. They stink now because of the asdfcomps.
Nittany_Discord: *Laughs like Pinkie Pie* THROW ME! THROW ME! :P
08,01"what kind of cheese is this?" says i
and
13http://fav.me/d50o6g3
08,01"why, it's stilton," says the mother
lol Shizu
tastes like bleu?
08,01but lo, i think, this does not taste liek stilton!
SunderlandPony89: HUZZAH
and sooo
08,01further investigation into the contents of the muffin revealed that the cheese looked *nothing* like blue stilton
o.o
Evening everyone
08,01so i surmised a hypothesis:
hai PrincessLuna
evening madam Luna -tips hat-
o hai PrincessLuna
hi PrincessLuna.
PrincessLuna: Eeevening
I should be sleeping but I took a long nap and can't sleep :'(
MahBoi777: How are you interupt me! Only I can interput me! Just like then
08,01the cheese in question was, in fact, not blue stilton, or any kind of blue cheese at all
PrincessLuna: Hello your majesty. *Bows down*
CHAT DERP HOLD ON!
00,10green chees instead?
red cheese?
08,01it was merely cheese that had been left for half a year or more in the fridge. so long that it had acquired growths.
stilton*
PrincessLuna, ikr? I just woke up a hour ago, although its 0:36...
fuzzy cheese isn't cool
SunderlandPony89: *troll face*
Eeyuck
/me hugs WallDives
08,01and these growths had been cut off, and the rest of the cheese used
Your Mother must be terminated
/me gags
There we go :)
08,01which my mother categorically denied
resistance is futile.
To be erased.
So I'll leave for bed, but first, a final joke: Why didn't Valve go to E3?
What is that she is laying on?
by an austrian death machine.
T_T
CriticKitten: cause they cant count to 3
LAWL
08,01but it was *really* obvious from her behaviour, and from the taste and appearence of the cheese that she was lying about it being stilton, so i wouldn't complain
00,10double kill
Spectrum_Rush: Yep!
d:
08,01needless to say, i got rather upset at her
seeya CriticKitten
/me goes to bed.

HowToFryChicken, learn how to TAB
08,01it didn't bode well for me
Rain: Why can't we be friends :o
08,01Spectrum_Rush: i know! that was the fun of the original statement!
go over with a fresh block, see if you can convince her to file 19 the old stuff
00,10do as she does, admit noting
08,01that's exactly why i phrased it that way, in fact
HowToFryChicken: because you're screwing up royal?
HowToFryChicken, Im just saying, type a few letters in a nick and then press TAB
unless she;s actually trying to cultivate a penicillian farm

08,01and it was my job to set them up
HowToFryChicken, please, dont.
08,01and, of course, this being april fools day, i decided to have a bit of fun
I intended not to
08,01so i named them after the 7 dwarves
seems legit
im falling behind in my work
08,01and gave them appropriate attributes to boot

That reminds me. I have laundry that needs running
SuperBrony64: How are you today?
HowToFryChicken: how long is the speech?
Idk...
0,14not a movie
Mixitupboo: it's not a movie its diebuster
StupidSexyCJ: Three to five minutes, but the material has to be very throrough.
0,14this is Diebuster
Ok.... Good to know
wasnt this streamed a few months ago
StupidSexyCJ: Basically, im trying to size down political babble into stuff that makes sense for a bunch of smoke-headed JB 15 year olds.
/me dances out of chat for an unknown amount of time
03not really
03I mean, I don't need 27 colors either
00,10all the badguys
03but plain white backgrounds suck XD
02Really though, just as long as the website doesn’t need to interact with its users standard HTML is fine
/me waves Bai to DeathStar
/me HowToFryChicken joins DeathStar in this dance he speaks of.
i need to write.
HowToFryChicken: a tip my speech professor taught me for speeches like that, "bullshit baffles brains"
03yeah
StupidSexyCJ: Thanks for the tip.
03so got any templates? :p
03also how's that script coming
/me runs
Nanoha could beat all of them easily

024 are Joomla and 1 is HTML
SaxyPretender: do tell
0,14the Twins are topless
And?
0,14they said that space monster is a topless and like them
03I don't even know what Joomla is LOL
uhhh
heheh
SaxyPretender: im trying to follow
So the topless become space monsters?
So they are the space monster?
00,10lolnope
no the space monster IS topless.....I think
what anime is this?
they ded
02well, it takes awhile to learn how to use it, so it wouldn't be very good for you atm
well...
00,10yes it shot through the planet
He fired his lazar
that went well
happy ending
hory sheet
What planet was that again?
ummmmmm
02and it's kind of a waste to use Joomla on such a simple website XD
00,10and that is just one space monster
o-o
I think Titan
ded
00,10gunbuster killed them by the millions
02Joomla is only good if you want to make a PHP website
dayum
ouch
ded
owwwwww dafuq
That reminded me of how Asuka died in end of evangelion
00,10well this is gainax
Sumi that wxplains things

0,14we
00,10nono: full power

lol
GO NONO!
dat quiff
0,14Nono doesn't need a Buster Machine
0,14she IS one
her hair commands space thingies
03I've honestly never made a site in DreamWeaver
03mainly edited them
03I used to use FrontPge
03*Page
03as much as people complain, it does work
What's going on guize?
XAX: I have no idea
Hi XAX
Like a baws
hey XAX
She became OP by sheer will power
00,10turns out the space monsteres they were fighting were actaly the defences set up to protect sol from true space monsteres
02well, that's how I learned. Editing templates
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
02you learn a lot doing that
and there goes the palnet
And then titan died
0,14remember how she has a knack for perfectly cutting this
0,14*things
you mean including humans right sumica? I mean we kinda are monsters
WHY do I come in at the moment of awesome and not find out what happened to LEAD to said moment?
0,14everyone's dead, but hey

0,14happy music
So she was a buster machine the whole time?
wb
I wish I had a buster machine
hows classes going?
No, you ARE a buster machine
and then she was a buster machine
I see.
Man, I was half asleep through most of this.
Happy ending
dat plot
0,14Nono is best Buster Machine :3
After coming down off dealing with something I had never experienced before in WoW... a party that would not talk, didn't listed, and when I was the freaking tank kept pulling before I was ready-- my main is a hunter, but this was the first true huntard I have ever met.
02No more classes for now. Just been studying freely XD
Hi Kencolt

00,10luckaly I was a druid so i had swipes a crte
0,14this is good
i liked tanking for the im nigh unkillable feeling
SaxyPretender: indeed. Where was this found?
And yet-- on the bosses-- I still kept threat-- at one time I managed to get 442%.
Watch Ponies = Talking about WoW
0,14I have no idea, might wanna ask Sumica XD
epic trailer time
00,10I have taken to wiki walking youtube for ponies. so I been fining more new good stuff
oh man epic trailer
No WAY was he going after anypony else. Now all the undead she kept summoning... well...
02I remember I used to totally not understand how CSS worked XD
Sumica: carry on! :D That was great
i have to verbaly slap my friends in lotro when they jump in too early
Ponycraft? or...
00,10problem is i am kinda picky with my videos
03I still don't./
not Ponycraft
03I really only undestand HTML
03and even then, all I ever do is just edit it
03because LOl trying to make an actual graphic page out of plain text
03that's not going to go over well
MLP the movie.
/me explodes

I just got back and... oh god, why is Lyra at the top now? I hate change! :D
0,14I really like her mane
Spectrum_Rush: lol indeed
02The worst mistake you can make is forgetting which lines of CSS will affect a certain part of your HTML
dem nips
Nipples
I see boobs
sprrroinnnng
boobies!
yes we know.
03this is why I don't do web design
0,14Groooooving magic
gainaxing...
No need to point them out
Time to do some laps around my couch
03I haven't even updated my website since like 2006
03>_>
/me is loving what Wrek is doing with that AJ pic~
03I want to compeltely redo it
SHUDA UP GUYS! YOUR ACTING LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE SEEN THEM :[
Rain: Who isn't?
0,14also, "No...no...ri...ri...ko"
what he is still doing to that AJ pic :3
02then you have to go through testing all of the CSS lines and seeing which ones will affect the text you want it to
0,14sound familiar? :3
Nope
no
02XD
0,14No...ri...ko
03PHP is just as bad
I hope I can get TF2 working :$
/me ~evry party needs a pooper thats why they invited you Om ,party pooper party pooper
03I was trying to edit the company website, and my god
03took me all day to do like one line
Who is Noriko?
^
:P
oh, sounds good
0,14the protagonist of Gunbuster
ah
03thing that pisses me off about PHP is you can't just open it in your browser to test it
02PHP is like a bad tool box
03you have to actually upload it to the server each time
Spectrum_Rush: You peged me. And I take great pleasure in my work.
night, everypony! Ya'll take care now. I'll see you all tomorrow!
gnight Sylandest! sleep well:)
0,14later Sylandest
Lies, Captain Bright is the protagonist of Gunbuster
Sylandest: Get a bunk bed
02everything acts like it's broken XD
my classes start next week
Night night Sylandest :)
0,14Brightslaps, everywhere?
watching this as i play Eve: Online
/me hugs MahBoi777, SaxyPretender, Om, Ponies47 and everypony else
Om: why bunk bed?
Captain Bright is the protagonist of every robot series
/me hugs Sylandest back
Hugs Sylandest back :)
no exceptions
Sylandest: So there is a greater falling distance :)
02And some things don’t even make sense
03well, I can certainly see the use of PHP, for such a nice looking site there were very few lines of code
00,10nice eyes
03but trying to understand it, my god LOL
:O
Om: lol :D
00,10nice headgear girls
02well yeah, PHP is useful once you're finished XD
So, I was thinking....
good night everyone

Shizuka: I would suprised if anyone misses your reference earlier... :$
Ponies47: try playing it on hard
Missed*
Airpuff: yeah. It says updates shall be done in about a hour *mane deflates*
Shizuka: soo its bassicly the loss of a part of an irc sever?
XAX: i missed it :)
13it's the loss of the connection between two servers
xmasskills: nah. That sounds to HARD! :P
How though D:
Ponies47: ... soon.. :)
/me explodes
/me gots to do things see ev'ry one a bit later
Shizuka: too for me terms its like me loseing connection to the internet....because the connection is lost
Ponies47: i see what you did there... it just wasnt very funny
/me forces drf to make his website using C++
Airpuff: Why can't it load faster. O well.
:P
later Spectr....
xmasskills: :'(
damn
Ponies47: baecuse it loves being slow ...
/me hugs Ponies47
02:D
shamroc: in principle, it's the loss of a part of a network. imagine if the network was shaped like the letter X. And the one in the middle failed. Then you'd have four disconnected but equal "networks" - which is sorta ok, until the middle one comes back, and they're forcibly remerged
its okay
03oh yay, Hetzner unblocked the IP
13oh dear asuka was just under 80C for that game...
Airpuff: true
00,02i'm connected to both twilight and aj right now

Shizuka, I think you need to take her apart and get some air duster
00,10Just wait till this end.
13that's not too bad for it to drop 20C in a little over ten minutes..
13yeah i need to disassemble my desk soon..
BRB
Shizuka: I forgot Asuka was your comps name :P
13the AC is probably helping the least, drawing more power from the same circuit
13there's the end of the split
13welcome back applejackers
so that's what a chicken sounds like in Japan...
welcome back
\o/

02oh, the webhost who banned you from your own server?
