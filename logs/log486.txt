13despite the fact we procrastinated all lesson, we got away with it cuz we were labelled as being well-behaved
Saturn: .. respect that.. :P
THE JAZZ
13and we did actually do all our work on time somehow LOL

00,10You requested a pose like that Nitt?!
ALSO
08,01oh wait, wrek's streaming?

13getting the teachers to like you lets you get away with anything LOL
06imagine if you worked that effectively, but didn't wait until the day before it was due!
/me hides
08,01ah, okay
13Oh we did keep up with our work, we just did it while messing around at the same time :D
12LOL most teachers liked me
12it paid off in the last two years as well

12I said
12"oh it's not important, don't add it if you don't want to"
dat haiir shine
12"alright =)"
13I think even my tutor thought the same cuz I didn't get bothered about my attendance
/me 11,01stops
12the exam consisted of questions such as "what is eBay" (2 marks)
I needs talk to him

http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s83/btk2nd/abandonthread.gif

12than here
12oh yeah I know

worked too well
11,01I didn't break any rules.

Tolerate....tolerate... ><
02Sony ruined themselves this time
...Um.
03I just don't care about E3
Interesting time to join stream, huh?
03hype is annoying
03and can be dangerous in large groups :P
http://imgur.com/gallery/1zO2m
03fanboys of any series
03or company
03not really
03where did you come up with that?
03YOU might think of them first
looks like applejack had a bit too much of applejack :)
02hurr
yes you are
:<
02well, I like a few of their things. But some things they do is just stupid
02EW
03again, >Hype
Hyper?
03honestly, is it that hard to just wait until actual release dates of things before you start caring about them?
. But some things they do is just stupid
:D
03exactly.
03I used to watch E3, but it ends up being depressing LOL
06and this year was borderline painful to watch
03like "OMG I WANT THA-oh wait, 2013?"
also, has a good music and comedic sense
03easier to just not care
03once they actually get close to releasing something, then be excited about it
Heh
I've heard this
A friend told me this one. A friend I don't see anymore.
Sometimes, the Universe just throws you a freebie.
05blaspheme, blasphemyou
02well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD
Eddie izzard is a great comedian
11,01Sexy, why are you ponies?
blaspheverybody
http://imgur.com/gallery/QIzlh

02Nintendo E3 that is
11,01So much religious humor. :/
06feather-face
Nittany+Discord that, is no typo
02floof face
:D
02:3
03<BlueFlare> well, I tend to get anticipated a lot when I watch E3 XD <- which is exactly why I don't pay attention to E3 LOL
03it's just easier to wait until stuff's official
HAHAHAHA
rested from then on
02but I can't help it XD
i was drawing and that line cracked me up
06and for actual games preferably until they are released.
XD
I can only imagine how good the first batch was.
03yeah
03or at least like, released in Japan
lol
03to show off
*hugs Wrek*
03wagglan? LOL
06gimmicky motion controls i guess.
Hai
03oh
06a rather common "complaint" whenever motion controls are mentioned
06or the wii is mentioned
03well
03Kinect is honestly
03a really expensive webcam
03games that use it are just ugh
03XD
06but it's like 3D
Dinosaur bar.
03>total money whoring
3D ftw
06if it's used in dumb ways like OMG LOOK WE MAKE HANDS GO AGAINST YOU XD then it's totally bad
06then there's actually using it to add something besides that
03some 3D movies were impressive, most are just gimmicks
hey guys I'm looking for commissions to help pay $200 rent +$200 student loan payment
03and 3DS, I keep the 3D on that thing off at all times
06and "forced 3D" is just as bad as games shoehorning in multiplayer just because they feel like they have to, even when it makes zero sense and has nothing to do with the singleplayer
At least the 3DS isn't forced 3D :D
02Nintendo lets you turn it off
03yeah, but 3DS with no 3D is just a DS LOL
hey guys are there any pony travel blogs?
02I like 3D. They don't even charge more because of it. (now that the 3DS is $160)
03yes they do
03DS games were always $30
033DS games are like $50
03*40
03Newer DS games are like $35 but LOL GREEDY COMPANIES
023DS games are harded to make. >better graphics
02harder*
02orly
03it's not like they sit there going "How can we render this on a tiny screen"
AJs left arm seems kinda thin
and then I work on Camp nanowrimo
03-Z
g'night up
all*
03anyway
11,01*shipping
03It probably costs all of $2 to make one of those cartrdiges
hiya guys, what's up?
03disc-based games are the cheapest
03stuff like Xbox 360/PS3
It's not porn, It's Evocative postioning!
We gonna be watching the 3DS conference?
a Applejack pony pinup
You do know
03um
033DS is 240
03not 320
03also I mean the games, not the hardware
02oh, my bad
03Hardware is usually reasonably priced.
oh
yeah
03Think about it
033-4 3DS games as much as the entire system?
03Yeah right
But they *have* to make the software expensive to pay for the losses on the console
03no they don't
well hey
Ambassador games :D
Greetings everypony.
/me runs
TRUTH
03I'd believe it more if htey weren't multi-billion dollar companies
02drf, do you think those games cost $0 to make?
06no he doesn't but they don't cost $40
06to make
11,01RAWRity: Stop advertising it.
03They sell it for $10 a piece, and 100,000 people buiy it, they break even
03now how many copies of most good games sell
0330 million plus?
Advertising costs too
:p
03screw advertising.
06loads emoney
/me runs
0210 million plus most of the time
03it's them wanting STUPIDLY HIGH Profits, really.
11,01The universe is not going to collapse on itself.
At least they're not Apple Profits
Ahem
03actually they're worse
03Apple sells hardware
Rain: I agree. The hair does look good
06So, who's worse.
03software is literally paying for code
http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s83/btk2nd/abandonthread.gif LOL
03Not sure LOL
Ubisof
t
03they're probably around the same
for DRM
:P
03BlueFlare, that doesn't mean I'd charge an arm and both legs though
INB4 Make all the gams free and open source
11,01Expansion is actually speeding up.
06most people do and therefore the companies keep on truckin'
He speaks alot of truth. XD
03right
02also, the workers won't work for them unless they can pay them $$$
11,01But it's on the edge.
03which is also why piracy doesn't hurt much, because of all the people that DO pay
11,01But then they found out that expansion is speeding up.
08,01is this eddie izzard?
03^
11,01Yes.
yes
03*the
03m
hiya Saturn
0620x
I groaned at that one
02takes*
03especially now with them cheaping out on disc
03*discs
08,01life is good
03like the stupid eco-boxes with no manuals
03also look at download games
06well of course, but even when publishers, devs, everyone takes their cut
03that's essentially FREE to distrib ute
03:P
get over it
03yeah
03it's why I don't bother buying games now
Rain: damn mixed signals.....:P
03there's no real value gained
03unlike back with like, SNES
08,01like "spaniel"
06>age of empires 2
08,01and "bernard"
It's not just the word, though. It's also how he says it.
06>200+ page pocket thing with info on everything
03inb4 PDF file on a CD
06basically free strategy guide
06and no
08,01aye
03well I've seen that XD
03not on games
03but like, hardware
03will have "drivers + manual" on a CD
06x3
06it's just not the saaaame
03rather than trying to dig through loads of paper
03but still, it comes across as cheap
03which we all know is th case anyway
03*the
06not saying that all manuals should be damn books of course
