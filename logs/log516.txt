This place is great for just chatting, having some talk about everything
04;~;
Emma/Clueless is easier than Disgrace though
lol
but 2500 words is overkill
the thing is we all have at least one common intrest, ponies
Wubwubwub ^-^
hurr
needs to be 2000-ish words
not including bibliography and appendix
The others was made by someone else
intro is 500, main body is 1000, conclusion is 500
I have my intro done
thats the best part :D
04o-o
04blargh

00,02Invi, ikr
this should answer most questions
This caused a few people to take offense(in a cartoon, wtf?), and complained
oh...i see
The Derpy fiasco was kind of our fault
Because we named her as such
hi everypony!
i think if the voice actor had done her voice as a female originally it wouldnt have gone as bad as it did
Yeah, we loved Derpy, she's great
She is

Oh wow it didn't explode in 2 seconds?
00,02in theory i could make it to mun
WERE COMING AGAIN LUNA!!
The framerate improved aswell
11,01Add some RCS to help with control.
11,01RCS thrusters.
you just need to get it out of the atmosphere and you'll be fine
00,02i unno
is it starting to tilt?
00,02if i switch to the rockets with thrust vectoring
some rockets are about to run out
that might be bad
Why is that thing even working lOL
00,02allso i have no staging or parachute
It's tilting pretty bad!
00,02i was actualy relying on the rockets exploding off
00,02i'm tilting it :P

08,01Bronysith: wow, the correct use of irony. have +1 internets
08,01Meanwhile: "Crocodile Hunter"
08,01yes, it is.
08,01he hunts the crocodiles, and is meant to be in control of them
Fail
dat laugh
08,01i suppose it depends on how you look at it
Saturn: going by that name, yeah. But he spends most of his time with them, it wouldn't be surprising if eventually his luck runs out.
08,01if you see it as "he pokes crocodiles, he's gonna get eaten", *then* it's not ironic, it's coincidental
Dat's one cool shelter
ever*
This is animal snuff! O_O
08,01in that manner, being killed by a stingray *was* ironic
Dat roofing
:O
I wish I could make such an awesome shelter.
DO HO HO
lol
Saturn share please!
08,01DrHobo: which one?
wow
he should hurry up before the zombies and skeletons show up
hi all
Saturn thanks!
08,01DrHobo: what's it about?
:)
/me has a hankering for fish
Stingray and hermit crab. Nice.
thatssssssss a nice campfire
Genuinely tasty for once
Shocking
PETA would be pissed watching this xD
08,01hmm
08,01i should stream some Stingray at some point
Saturn: oh you :D
Gordon Ramsey says: It's raw!
Saturn: It was meant to be taken seriously ;A;
...........
Turn THIS OFF!
08,01DrHobo: that makes it even more hilarious
Anyone reminded of the Dayz mod when he talked about the night?
