SlurryMoon: Really?? :O Intensive Pony Unit showed me the show :)
Om, I'm not pickey! This song... is just not even... that good. >.>
I like how the ''Original version'' links to the ytpmv rather than THE ACTUAL SONG AVAST YOUR ASS
My first exposure was Shes a Pony Tombstone remix
My first pony video made me think that Twilight was the villain :D
followed by Alex S and PinkiePieSwear stuffs
My first exposure was SUnshine and Celary Stalks
Petrified_Discord: Lol what?? :D
My first exposure to the fandom was on the Escapist
yep She's a PONY is best PMV
Petrified_Discord: Well, THAT'S a major misconception.
so much yay
I honestly don't remember where i first noticed MLP FIM but i knew about it very close to when it was made i tink
Alister: I sense much rage. 'Tis parallel to otakon's.
My first exposure was a spray on TF2. It wasn't NFSW.
was*
O_o
Ninjazz: oh
oh mai
mhmm
O.o
When i was first introduced to the brony fandom, it made me think RD was the main character O_o
Reikim: I think it's a perfect example of how self-centered our fandom can be
Hater was born.
i was wondering why you would say it wasn't
the first time i ever got into MLP F.i.M was when i was fighting a server admin who was a brony
Ninjazz: thats a shame
Ninjazz: So it WAS safe for Woona?
It was Portal's "Want you Gone" and the way she hooked up Pinkie Pie to the science...thing...made it seem like she was the "sciency" one that didn't believe in the magic of friendship :D
Alister: Someone hasn't been around long if you think it only applies to our fandom.
PinkiePieCopy, Nnnnope.
3Okay and with this last repeat of Das Boot, Wrek is going to take over.
eeeyup
mine was YTP
Ninjazz: So it wasn't safe for luna?
Er, Woona?
Wrek time!?! :3
Reikim: I'm not ragin atm, I'm just worried I'll have to take my PC apart to satiate my mother. and I don't want to do that bc THIS place and the peopel I've met here is the ONLY reason I haven't gone into a soul crushing depression sinc I've been out of work
In my case, it was reading a random article-- somewhere-- I don't remember where-- and thinking, "Maybe I should check thyis out." I was bucking DOOMED after that.
yay
Wreky stream :3
When I first saw somebody talking about MLP, they kept talking about "Derpy" in episodes. I thought there was an actualy, canon main character in the show called Derpy Pony.
PinkiePieCopy, I don't think she would have liked to see Pinkie Pie in that way. :(
Play it again!
Reikim: What I'm saying the guy should have given credit to Renard for making the song
and lo-and-behold, a year after that, it became half-right.
Now stop, Wrek time!
-__-
O.o
lol this again :D

Om, you should have been there when I was on.
Alister: It's an isolated case and you shouldn't take it as representative of the entire fandom, and above all it does not merit that much rage.
Reikim: But someitmes they forget about the original
PinkiePieCopy, agree to the fullest. I became a hater that day.
I don't know if I want to after hearing that.
Reikim: Who said I raged ?
RAWRity: I see you've decided to fill up my folder again?
Ninjazz: ... HATER. BRONY. DOES NOT COMPUTE.

RAWRity: Yeah- THAT'S exactly what she's look like as a human.
So...how does this alicorn mod work? :P
PinkiePieCopy, coincidentially, the steam page for TF2 on my computer has the image there... I just realized this. -__- So I now remember what the imgage looks like.

VenHur96: You can't really blame them...you can hate them, but not blame them.
11,01No ability to allow server cheats (sometimes, cheating is fun when everyone does it).
Microsoft deserves to burn for killing TF2. I dont think I'll ever forgive them for that

did Wrek get kicked for a admin slot?

Hello there VenHur96

Oh hey, Nittany is here. So I don't need to throw out my "EA IS THE BEST COMPANY EVER" bait now?
Games with Ads: -Abyssmal

I hate paying for XBL....so thats why im a PC Gamer :)
XD
I would like it if games like Left 4 Dead 2 came with Pepsi and Coca Cola vending machines and stuff
Activision: We're not EA.
You know your smart when your a Pc and Console Gamer
Those are ads I actually want in video games
Ninjazz is awesome pony! :$

If I had a Computer that could run anything I'd be a PC gamer. :D
What does Activision do, again...?
Ninjazz? Ehh, hes alright.
Is anypony else buffering like tomorrow is a lie?
Activision: The Anti-LJN
Thanks... :$
Reikim: The same shit everyone else does, just not as bad as EA. Also, CoD
Totally stole that from The Jimquisition, but it's still funny as hell.
11,01Activision spends millions copy-pasting CoD.
Has a nice plot.
pony_0022: Not recently.
Nittany_Discord: (\ and i wish i had a PS3...but my 2 bros wanted a 360...so, majority rules :(
lol Om, ur incredible personality is showing
i still got those two copies of worms if anyone is intrested >.>
SolairePony89: Anything OTHER than CoD? Because as Nitt says, that's not really an example of good, original game-creation.
;>.>
Ninjazz: Yes you are! :[
I'm getting buffer every 5 seconds or so, and i know it's not my computer
11,01They have 6 developers working on CoD-related products now.
MahBoi777: It truelty is a gem of a plot
RaveBrony, okay! I am... :$;

Nittany_Discord: They're going to milk that cow until it's a dry, dead husk. And then they'll keep at it.

Nittany_Discord: What about Skylanders?
I wish Id was stronger than it is.
SolairePony89: Properties they own.
Nonsense. EA makes games.
And DON'T shoot it down because they changed Spyro
There's that godawful buffer again
And then runs them into the ground.
Ubisoft made Just Dance... Ubisoft I am dissapointed...
08,01hmm
08,01no crazies

What Nitt means is that Activision and EA publish.

Hi all :)
EA never makes games anymore derp

11,01They just sell them.

EA: We need 5 million copies of Dead Space 3 to sell in order for it to be marketable, so we're just going to turn it into Call of Honor: Modern Battlefield #706. ENJOY.
11,01They still own the righs to the games.
SolairePony89: Skylanders.

Reikim
:1
Reikim: They publically declared that Dead Space 3 needs to sell 5 million copies to be a marketable item (because they've spent way too fucking much on it), so they effectively redesigned it to ".
11,01Because of our shared views of how game companies are ruining gaming and gamers that let it happen.
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Mm?
"appeal to a broader audience"

CriticKitten: A stunning display of poetic irony in real life. Truly, as art mimics life, life mimics art.
Irish_Pony: simple its only maid hour
Nittany_Discord: as far as i know, you're only maid. all others are just costumes and wannabes
what is going on
Reikim: Ok, I KNOW that's sarcasam

DeathStar: Fair enough.
Oh, hey, DeathStar!
pony_0022: Friendship = magic, therefore the answer is friendship.

Om: as much as I wish I could Dance on here 24/7 I can't :(

Fuck ya sparkle sparkle sparkle!
I don't have an OC, I can draw. But I just don't feel like making my own OC. Feels odd
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: a place in scotland
huzzah the fun has been......!
Dat Applejack is... creepy
08,01okay... so i'm also matched with someone called happy_tractor
Om: fair enough, I used to feel the same way

Nittany_Discord: like i said, i would but cant. my mom controls my paypal, and doesn't believe in charity
08,01he looks like a big strong farm worker, though
11,01Why does she not?
08,01i'm totally game for that
Om, even with my OC made... It still feels odd.
MahBoi777: And then you took an [this is a bad meme and I feel bad]
[You must have a platinum account to read this message.]
Nittany_Discord: dunno. i'm pissed as all hell, though
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: yes, please hit on me.

Devonx25: ...What did you do.
/me reads WindWhistler's message
Hi everypony! :)
Om, Yeah... It's like... I could do better... But I don't know how...
Ninjazz: Youre OC? O.o have i seen it?
08,01Reikim: that's not entirely true
11,01Top 50 donors of $25 or more get Bronystate platinum accounts.
MahBoi777: I personally love that meme xD
WindWhistler: daw now i have to pay 40 extra dollars
um....
Ninjazz: Yeah...
Nittany_Discord: :O

RaveBrony, I don't think you have. No. :D Would you like to see it?
08,01Reikim: he didn't punch him. he kicked him so hard in the nutsack that he broke a few bones in his foot.
Nittany_Discord: =/
Ninjazz: Yes!! :)
Om: I think it's kinda overused now :$
what a story
WindWhistler: -_____- well played

Knock em dead, Scoot-Scootaloo.
Ninjazz: I always think you cuti mark would be a eight note with a 5 pointed throwing star behind it
08,01hmm, okay
08,01Reikim: in a closer up picture, not so hot: http://imgur.com/WxZDC
I mean, I love TF2 as much as the next pony, but is there any REAL shows coming up?
Om: or a sax lol
Om, I was thinking something along that line. But went with my obsession with Rarity instead. :D
LuigiNut02: mods stream what they feel like streaming during weekdays
so who knows?
MahBoi777: Yeah, But those are hard to make so tiny
LuigiNut02 depends on your definition of REAL show and the streamer
RainBowJack, what do you think I should name it? :S
Okay, that's understandable
05gona win this map then draw
Ninjazz: Ninjazz
05relax

Ninjazz : name what?
Ninjazz Roughcut
LuigiNut02 wins how to suceed at bronystate upon entrance :3
08,01not bad: http://imgur.com/nNKNR
Well, see you guys, the streams laggin on me!
If I make an OC, she'll be a unicorn, and her talent will be shape-shifting.
RainBowJack, oh sorry. Tab Fail. :$
08,01Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: meh to you too, good sir
though that begs the question...what would her cutie mark look like?
Roughcut...
LuigiNut02: One of the best parts of this site is the variety. There's game streaming, and then there's anime, and then there's ponies, and then there's the Internet's most drugged-up crap.
Ninjazz : okay
Spectrum_Rush: brilliant name!
WindWhistler anything she wants it to be
MahBoi777: ikr
Dken2021: Wouldn't that be a bit Sue-ish?
Fuck it i'm bored watching this.

Reikim: Do the eyes start to follow you?

WindWhistler: Also he left his razor on the stublle setting.
Feed me Seymore

I wouldn't think of a gas giant as anywhere near an example of stealth
WindWhistler: little shop of horrors :3
Stealth
idk it was kinda random
........that doesn't sound right
Reikim: to scale? niccccce
WindWhistler: It's a great musical.
AJ ded
Okay I'm done.

Reikim: Isn't it a manga too?

/me noms LL
Iron_Edge: Are we talking sex now? Because we can totally do that.

Iron_Edge: Indeed :P
My eyes are bleeding

O.o
remember anyone who tries to get to fluttershy has to deal with repeated murder attempts by angel
i would hug her tightly
And it hurts even more that everyone is so distracted by a sexy Fluttershy...
;o
I was thinking the same thing
/me Speaks sex to Reikim
kidzrul434: that's good right?
/me cries a river
FLUTTER SHY WITH
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I know how to deal with that little bastard.
NO
/me forgets that there is even a chat here and watches stream
/me dams the river and hugs WindWhistler
MahBoi777 NO IT"S NOT GOOD
/me talks sex right back to Iron_Edge
Ninjazz: Stop reading this then.
Reikim btw you can do anything about him cause then you would know flutterage
Well, I'm gonna attempt to draw a full pony figure...
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Oh you underestimate me. There are ways to deal with him without causing him any harm. It usually involves a crapton of money, carrots, drugs, or all three.
But it'll be nothing to gawk. Don't be too disappointed.
I wanna see Wrek do a saucy Big Mac pic, just for the lulz
SolariePony89: oh god no
Hey. This ad says I am the 999,999th visitor. This is like the 10th time its happened! I am SO lucky.
........
Reikim knowing angel you would have to give the 3 plus your soul, virginity and something else
Give the colts some attention
I came back..to...see this? WHATS WREK DRAWING? :O
Wrek : really why does FlutterShy have that massive wing Boner?
FlareChaser: Sexi Fluttershy
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: What should I give? My innocence? Lost that ages ago. My childhood? Rotten and defiled at this point. I'm out of ideas here.
aww fuck. i missed the beginning.
RainBowJack: She doesn't have a wingboner...
FlareChaser: Fluttershy doing something
SolairePony89: I'll enjoy this! :D
Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: SWEET
i didn't know there was drawing.
FlareChaser: As will I :P
/me is disappointed.
Reikim hey that's why i said something else, how should i know what is going to ask for that bunny
WindWhistler : what would you call it?
Devonx25: I forgot to mention that. There's also Wrek drawing sexi poniez while he plays intense music in the background.
6_9
Shamefu dispway
:'( why would you draw that?
o\\\o
Ninjazz: Don't worry, its just a drawing.
;)
FlareChaser: Because of reasons
YAY!.
/me =3 pomf
/me clops
RainBowJack: Spreading out her wings...Wingboners aren't the only reason why they ever have their wings out like that. >_>
FlareChaser I would for money >.>
Om, a gewd one.
FlareChaser: And lulz I guess
Ninjazz: But of course!
and then the mane chat went wild -__
Reikim: taking the risks
Chat Gone Wild
/me is totally underwhelmed by the stream.
Almost... Almost... It can get wilder.
WindWhistler : i know but its funnier this way
Morning every pony. I finally got a little sleep after over doing the painkillers yesterday ^_^ only 4 hours but hey I'll take it.
Flarechaser, there was a fanfic that described humans quite accurately. "Humans are imaginative creatures, anything you can possibly think of, someone has taken that idea, and taken it four steps further." :)
SolairePony89: Sounds like a bad porno for chatfiends.
Heya FairysHuff, welcome to the saucy stream!
Good thing FairysHuff
He better draw Sexy Octavia next ;)
This is amazing.
Hello there, FairysHuff. Your optimism is showing again.
I think he already has
RyunosukeKnT including bad ideas :p
FlareChaser: We would have to restrain you.
Since the stream popped up, I'm suddenly in a bitter mood.
FairysHuff: Elllo der
/me puts WindWhistler on his shoulders so she can see over the stream
/me *snapflash lets get chaotic *snapflash HHAHAHAAHAHAHAahahahaah~
Om: Noooo! no!
FlareChaser: ...Now I'm thinking of the bowtie as an accessory for an actress of low moral fibre. Dammit.
Hallo guys ^_^ And thankyou
FlareChaser: i didnt see you there :3
Wrek: Looking good.
/me doesn't care for the stream
Panda: Moar sexeh octavia.

FairysHuff: dose your head still hurt :(

FlareChaser: linke me?
While the art is amazing, I just don't care for these types of pictures.
/me gets into FlareChaser's head

FlareChaser: There's a section devoted to music...oh, look, a shrine devoted just to Octavia's cello...
Hello PaladinDrakkenwolf, and you walked into sexi poni hour

SolairePony89: -___-
DeathStar: Tomporo Madibular Joint Disorder. I missed out an entire word
WindWhistler: ...Adding to the list...
does anyone hear anything?
Silence... calm before the storm
TheGreatAndPowerfulT: But it's not about if everyone knows here. It's about whether or not the victim knows, and believes that nobody knows.
WindWhistler: Would you still pet it :3
DeathStar: Oh it'll be months maybe even years before the doctors get around to deciding if i need surgery or not

SolairePony89: :$
SolairePony89: ur not alone:S

SolairePony89: have you applied to them? And if so, did you call back after an interview or turning in your application?
Sylandest: Why not go into weapons dealing? I hear it's profitable.
Yes. No this... I a weapon.
Sylandest: No interview yet and I've turned in applications. I live in a really small town, so I doubt they'd need an interview
SolairePony89: you'd be surprised. Consider calling them back to ask if they've read your application. It shows how serious you are about getting the job
FairysHuff: kentuckians need no weaponry save pitchforks and torches...XD
need to go back and look for a job, probably go back to target
Sylandest: OOoooh kentucky. You have sexy southern gals there like AppleJack?

This part of the song... T__T

CriticKitten: LAWL! Ohh man that's funny!
Wrek is streaming cute Fluttershy? JOY! :p
Blizzard is no longer blizzard. The old blizzard is dead
good night everyone

00,10no need for me xxMoopyxx I am 20 min from an indian reseveration
Bluestrom_S: night
FairysHuff: Starcraft 64, dude.
Night Bluestrom_S :)
CriticKitten: I can see why they would with the touch screen the Wii U has
*Moopy goes off and buys every pony a bottle rocket fire works*
gnight Blu

Night, blu...

Throw a broken HDD platter like a ninja star :P

05gona take a break
Look at everyone that tried to say bai to BlueStorm. XD
05drawing something completly different
*Moopy comes back with alot of bottle rockets to give every pony*
Wrek: sounds like a plan
Well, I gotta go too, night everypony... Oh, and fluttershy looks great :)
night, Dr_Fumbles
Wrek: Draw mlp/Saber from FateStay ^_^
Gnight, Dr_Fumbles. Take care. :)
gnight Dr_Fumbles!
13drawing something completely different
shurikens?
nigty Dr_Fumbles
13liiiiiike
13vi x me?
00,10ahhh but I was hopeing for somthing much like that
Night Dr_Fumbles :)
I dunno about the idea, it could work. I have to snort at the notion that it somehow proves Blizzard is dead and gone, though, since Blizzard already put one of their games onto a Nintendo console in the past. I'd note that it's true Blizzard is dead, but this is most certainly NOT a reason why
Shizuka: oh mai~
Shizuka: *drools*
Vi x Shizu would be too saucy for our viewers, Shizu
Dr. Fumbles.....where have I heard that before :/
00,10I like shizus idea
Indeed. The old Blizz is dead.
Sumica: who doesnt? XD
/me misses it so
as do I :3c
Hey i bought this cool lookin bottle rocket for rainbow dash so this is only for her
CriticKitten what's the harm of putting an MMO on a console?
00,10MahBoi777, robot chicken
ew
Dken2021: There isn't any.
oh that's right! thanks Sumica
I hate that show :P
CriticKitten: I see this as a good thing. More people get to experience a good game
Dken2021: Though the control scheme is likely going to suck for that.
right right now I remember
*Moopy shoots off a bottle rocket for rainbow dash*
I have never seen Robot Chicken :$
SoliarePony89: I think if they get the interface to work, it could be awesome, actually
yeeeeaaahhh whoooooo!
and Wrek is moving on to a completley different picture, lets see what it is...*watches the stream closely*
Starcraft 64 had a somewhat "meh" interface, so did C&C 64.
CriticKitten I suppose that, but with that touchpad, could be an intersting control scheme
I burned myself out on WoW years ago. Can't face any MMOs anymore. So much time wasted
Irish_Pony: 10 bits says its a pony XD
CriticKitten: If the Wii U gets any Total War game I might just have to pick up a Wii U at some point
Dken2021: For SC2? It'd be interesting.
So how was Toy Story 2? :)
/me dose not apresiate this cover
I imagine that it'll be difficult to implement though, and hard to run the game through the same Battle.net networks on the Wii U unless the internet capabilities are up to snuff
Oh wow... my friend just gave me an update on a picture he's drawing for me and it just...wow....
Well I'm gonna try and get a little more sleep. Back in a few hours. Later.
Irish_Pony: can we see it?
laters, FairysHuff! :)
http://i.imgur.com/ugXpH.jpg
Night night again FairysHuff :)
CriticKitten: Forgot about all that crap. If only Blizzard could go without the Battle.net networks for the Wii U version, but we all know that isn't gonna hapen
bye FairysHuff! take care:)
Hey i know who that pony is
Cya till then FairysHuff
Soarin?
dat badass looking pony. I bet it is Wrek just going outside on a normal day
is it docter whooves?
lol
Kinda looks like the guy from Alone in the Dark :P
FFS
SoliarePony89: I'd rather run through Battle.net than Nintendo's facade of an internet network for the Wii.
Use LAN?
aaaaaaaannnnnddddddd
think* damned new keyboard
I'm in a moving car
Are you a spy!?
SPAH!
Verizon just hates California
Icy spy
this area we were at earlier had no service at all LOL
hmm what is this
theres something in the sky..... and its a hammer....
:D
Also, in other gamer news, Okami in HD for PS3.
Hammer time.
Hey guys tomorrow im going to run 2 consoles the wii and the computer so that way im going to bring up both bronystate chatrooms at a time ok
Irish_Pony: engineer pony?
CriticKitten: Hopefully the Wii U will have much improved online systems so it isn't so stone age
07where?
Sylandest: Silly he has a wrench not a hammer :P
uh
Irish_Pony: ooh, quite right :$
drf
some national park

surprised this thing hasn't broken yet XD
07that area has beautiful roads with the right car
07a minivan
07not so much
I missed Toy Story?
CriticKitten: Blizzard is clearly going by the Bethesda rules of patching: Fix one thing, break 10 others
I hate myself.
exactly
we all felt sick after xD
05..
05....
I JUST got the email
How do you even....how does that kind of bug even HAPPEN?

Okay...I'm glad I'm not the only one who saw that, Spectrum_Rush XD

It's the bloody ambience screwing up your perception.
Spectrum_Rush: you saw that too?
Irish_Pony: true, it can. But if you show her how patient you can be, then she'll love you all the more for it, no? :)
she cant blink your just being paranoid!
OtakuTom: yea
MahBoi777: yea
Oh hey, she DID blink.
I SAW HER BLINK! :o
i just saw her blink
00,10layers how do they work
ello everypony :)
MAGIC
/me panics
you can make it an animated picture
Sylandest: I suppose :(
05if only i could make her pupils move too
SHE DID IT AGIAN! :o
THE PICS ALIVE EVERYPONY RUN
05that would be even freakier
this is some awesome music
Why not?
Wrek: =/
i see werk is still drawing Flootershy
/me hugs Irish_Pony and rubs his back "it'll be worth it, you'll see" :)
Wrek*
Wrek: get Flash then you can
Wrek: you could if you had another seperate layer
Wassup!
OMG SHE DID BLINK!
dat music
Hey DatOneBrony! :)
Wrek, when you used illustrator you could make them move :3c
So I'm new
00,10well realy wrek you could
ello DatOneBrony
Wrek, you make me want to go and draw. I did it when you were drawing AJ, but then I felt really sad and then watched ponies.
welcome DatOneBrony!
05im talking about inside sai doffuses
Welcome to Bronystate DatOneBrony!
00,10it would just be a realy large gif
DatOneBrony: WELCOME TO BRONYSTATE!
Sylandest: *hugs back* thanks lad
/me pours a mug of cider and hands it to DatOneBrony :3
lol, love you too, Wrek <3
Okay, I'm done
It'd be pretty easy to be able to move the eyes. You just need to put the iris and pupils in their own layer, make sure they're behind the eyelids and the face color, then you can move the whole iris/pupil layer around :P
Sumica: a hot...very sexy gif at that :P
05new people? hide the socks!
xD
So he drawing fluttershy
NAKED!
XD
Wrek: layering seperate eyes in different position than make one invisble

00,10zomg she blinkes then striped
Wrek, try making only ONE of the eyes blink ;)

Much more appropriate
Since Sony is creating hardware designed to interrupt my games with ads, and XBox intends to launch ads for its Kinect service.
Wrek has a mom? I just assumed that he spawned in the cataclysmic explosion of two galaxies smashing into eachother
8,6lol

Wrek: since ima fan of Pinkie Pie, are you gunna draw her like your drawing the others here?
Same wrek had an hour nap by 10 yesterday after sleeping for two h between 4-6 (parents woke me)

Jaketehsnake: Thanks mate!
8,6if someone does want a theme, drop me a note on DA and I can probably put something together when I get the time
Rarity one, please. ^-^

Oh yeah, After the baseball game when we we're walking back to the car. I yelled cock-a-doodle-doo agian and then I started acting like Pinkie Pie in that chicken outfit. :P

Ahhhh, love this song.

SoliarePony89: Read over that article. Dude is an asshat. >_> God forbid that reasonable complaints about the future of gaming be brought up.
/me continues using the defib unit 'DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!"
/me Cleans chat of tumble weed. "No littering in chat please"
hmm
Oh yeah, evening, everypony!
*SolairePony89, rather >_>
Brb
:D
CriticKitten: I only got half way through the article before I realized the writer was either a troll or a moron. I couldn't finish it after that
Point #2 is the one that really gets me.
/me tosses moar tumble weeds into chat
:D
/me wants his bunny really bad :'(
And his whole argument seems to center around "yes it's bad, but companies will do it anyways, so why complain durr hurr hurr"
Which is a positively stupid argument. >_>
CriticKitten Who's an ass?
CriticKitten: His "satire" of the reaction of gamers to all of those things was particularly annoying
05dat steel guitar
8,6link that article when nittany's around and you'll engage rant-mode :p
I want my bu-u-u-u-u-n-n-n-n-y-y-y-y! :'(
Doesn't take much to do that though kirzstryfe :P
flootershai has ur bunny
Kirz: I've prepared lots of good bait lines to lure Nittany out when I want to hear those rants.
CriticKitten You talking about Moviebob?
Like "EA IS THE BEST COMPANY EVER".
Irish_Pony, I don't want to be a jerk... but we heard you the first time. -__-;
MORE COWBELL!
8,6you say that like it's hard to do :p
CriticKitten: No, some idoit on Cracked.com
idiot*
CEC: Moviebob is annoying too.
>self-proclaimed film critic
11,01So my gaming industry rants can be initiated on command?
>wants to have credentials in video games
NOPE
DENIED.
oh descisions descisions http://derpy.me/bQscg descisions
CriticKitten: You forget that Moviebob is also a nerdr
05nostalgia critic is best movie critic. zero pucntuation is best game review I mean game reviewer/comedian
i guess so Nittany :$
CriticKitten Ugh, Moviebob lost all my respect a few months ago. The man wanted to judge the ME3 controversey with NO RESEARCH WHATSOEVER
My cat has more video game cred than Moviebob, he can piss right off.
05oh right
05bed
CriticKitten: Moviebob isn't Robert Ebert (or however you spell that asshole's name)
Wrek: True fax
Wrek: :(
Wrek: night
CriticKitten Hopefully, he either snaps awake or his hubris comes to bite him in the ass.
Also g'night!
night, Wrek!
Night CriticKitten
Was talking to Wrek. :P
/me tosses Wrek a pillow
Wuddi miss? ^-^
Though I should probably go to bed myself, it's already past 2. O.o
bloody Shockwave =_=
13know how much fun it is to read eight hours of irc logs, three times?
05BroKnee: fantastic music on stream
05watch it
CEC: Unlikely, he's sadly getting a steady paycheck from what he's doing right now. >_>
05while he's still alive
Wrek okai ^-^
Shizuka: Oodles..
Wrek I still like classical more :p
Shizuka: Depend on what you read :P
Shizu: I know exactly how much fun that is, actually. Turns out, not very.
05seeing when these sogns were written
05they are classic
Depends on the room you have logs on.
CriticKitten Well, maybe eventually he'll make such a faux pas that the Escapist and ScrewAttack will be too ashamed to keep him on the payroll.
Wrek Imeanclassical, piano, violin, cello ect.
CEC: You mean like Spoony or the like? Doubt it, but one can always dream.
My space bar sucks xD
Back. :)
6ok break over
6work again
Welcome back Ponies47

/me pets his other kitteh :D
Hey BroKnee :)
enjoy dat shower :3
Ponies47 How are you today? :)
BroKnee: Fine thank you :)
11,01So are my gaming rants nothing but entertainment?
Nittany_Discord: maybe....
CriticKitten Spoony, as far as I know, hasn't gone as far as to be ousted by his hosts (though his fans are another story). Also, unlike Moviebob, Spoony has legitimate talent.
i guess so Nittany_Discord :D
They are entertaining.
Nittany_Discord: There fun to watch. :P
Nittany_Discord: They aren't only entertainment, but they are entertaining
But to be fair, you're not saying anything I didn't already know. :P
Nittany care to go on a rant right now?
^ Pretty much yeah
CEC: He was recently suspended from TGWTG for a month.
Trust me being banned isn't fun :'(
CriticKitten Whaaaaaa? What did he do?
Due to a Twitter faux pas, IIRC.
11,01No. They won't make any difference.
Ponies47: What have you been banned from?
is scootaloo the only one with her own website?
CriticKitten What exactly did he say? He can get pretty pigheaded on twitter, so I can't imagine what he could have possibly said.
SolairePony89: I kind of gave a link to a fanfic that must never be named agian. :$
Chat got quiet. :(
NOPE
Was it somthing I said? :(
Ponies47: Ha. Glad you stayed on the chat though
CEC: It was a rape joke, I believe. Which is pretty tasteless, no matter how it's said.
Ponies47: it's all your fault!
SolairePony89: The ban was only for an hour but it felt like foreeeeeever! Of coarse I would stay I wub this chat so much! :)
Wrek: which is your fav. nostialgic critic review?
MahBoi777: Yes it was all my fault for that one time I got banned :$
CriticKitten Ouch. Yeah, that's pretty bad.
/me heads off to twitter land to check up on Tara's tweets
/me pats Ponies47 on the back
TwilightSparkle.com is on sale for $1,495 :D

Do I want to? Well, fair enough
Let's see
1. Do you have internet at home?
2. How long do each of your family members spend on the Internet?
3. What does your family use the Internet for most?
4. Does your family use the Internet to communicate with each other? If so, with which family members?
5. Who uses the Internet most in your family, and what for?
6. Do you think that some members of your family, or yourself, spends too much time on the Internet?
7. Has the Internet affected your family's relationship with each other at all? (i.e. are some family members reclusive because they're spending too much time on the internet?)
wow my chat to stream vid is like aminute off
8. Do you think that your family spends too much time on the Internet, or does someone in your family think you spend too much time on the Internet?
9. Does your family prefer to read books on the Internet or physically? Why?
10. Would you prefer to video chat, voice call, or have a telephone call? Why?
11. Has the Internet had a positive or negative effect on your family, and for what reason(s)?

Drake halp her out by answering the survey
tf2 and ponies....i mean one or the other but both....weird
Irish_Pony: I am playing with my moustache already. :I
Phase4: D:
Meanwhile: well then focus on that and not on me! :|
HNNNG
04NS:
Irish_Pony: But I like chat.
to much cute
041. Yes (obviously)
i know, it is a strange combination, TF2: WAR!!! MLP: Friendship
My computer is having an O-o-overdrive again.
Wooona!
042. Dad - about 2-3 hours a day. Sister - about the same. Mum - about half an hour.
043. Facebook and information.
daw
044. Yes, mostly with people we can't contact directly, such as people overseas.
045. I use the internet mostly, for chatting and looking up information.
046. Yes.
047. Some of us are more introverted, but it isn't a serious effect.
048. Other than me, no.
:D what the hell
hmm...someone should make a chatbot to chat with ponies
that is nighmare fuel Irish_Pony
Pyro is best pony.
Irish_Pony: What do you expect? It's a damn request.
pyro...is a pony?!?!
Spell-of-Gaming: wut?
Schrödingers chat.
People request weird crap on dA.
HELLO
00,02ragequit
00,02OH WOW
00,02epic lag on the stream
00,02hey guys, who's playing :P
I wonder how I'm gonna use Rolling Girl as a term...
Spell-of-Gaming: ..wat :D
00,02that there

Phase4: You, from the past.
00,02no, i'm from the future
00,02you guys are in the past
Phase4: Do you have a flying car?

/me 11,01dusts Phase4's head.

/me 00,02is dusted
do you have a pony as girlfriend then? (retarded question.avi)
Sad_Discord: Aw, your still dusting :)
/me dusts the sad from Sad_Discord
11,01I am.
what do you mean spy?
Hellllllooooooo Bronystate!
Allo BroKnee.
When I see Sad_Discord dusting, I see him as being the duster itself.
g'day BroKnee
Don't know why
Hows your day been everypony?
inb4 explosions
hai BroKnee
00,02too bad sumica isnt up
i read a true story about a guy who fell in love with a pony
00,02Sad_Discord, you want to stream?
ohh, KSP <3
inb4 horrible deaths
11,01Maybe.
Spy: wat da fauq??????
inb4 kerbal genocide
?
OH GOD
im not sure how many people here are THAT into ponys spy
00,02Sad_Discord, bug me if you want to, or just ninja
I FOUND 2 NEW MIKU SONGS I LIKE NOW
00,02either works ^_^
hurr
ok...
other questions, Drake?
durr
my brother is
11,01If you're still streaming, go on.
04oh whoops
04didn't see those
Why sad Dissie?
Sad_Discord: sorry to bother, but I posted about Bronyfunds on Ponygoons. Thought it might help the cause :(
049. Neither. My family prefers the Kindle, which would technically classify as "Internet" I guess.
11,01I hope so.
0410. Telephone call. I'm a nervous wreck either way and I'd prefer the caller not see my face.
i have MLP mods for my tf2
11,01There are so many drives going on that I don't think we'll bring in our $2.5k no matter how much attention we get.
how long will the funds be up for Sad_Discord ?
0411. A bit of both really, but mostly me. I'm not certain about the rest of my family in terms of how the internet has affected them.
11,01Friday.
damn
00,02:(
derp derp derp derpy derp
00,02plus the high profile ones like the humble bundle
00,02and all the non brony drives
I wish I had money to contribute, but unfortunately food doesn't buy itself. :/
in the mlp mod for tf2, scout is rainbow dash, and that is VERY odd
11,01Seeds of Kindness as well.
11,01They're raking in money.
plus the fact that there are no new eps streams to advertise it
00,02http://www.keyr.com/ interesting site
Phase4 how so?
00,02its interesting
"this is scout, rainbows make me cry" FAIL
11,01There are a lot of problems that will probably cause us to not hit our goal.
Phase4 huh, your right, that is an interesting site
Sad_Discord how far off are you?
Chrysalis: you're*
THis song may help out.
Even if it looks grim

Meanwhile i really don't care, i finished english at gcse
oops
Bob marley ftw
11,01$1,385
11,01We need that much to meet our goal.
:(
Sad_Discord: It takes Card, or only paypal?
00,02Sad_Discord, are you watching stream?
Chrysalis: no one appreciates being corrected, but I will do it until I die anyway.
Phase4 current destination?
00,02Mutterguy, not exploding
11,01Stream is frozen for me.
alright thanks
00,02Sad_Discord, refresh
Oh yeah! KSP!
/me has a bad day
Sad_Discord: Does it take Credit Card, or Paypal only?
Stream was frozen today
11,01Fine.
11,01You silly bronies.
No
Can I post a video link? :3
You can't fo that
Vordox: I think paypal.
Only Paypal?
oh <censored> I forgot to put my demographic/target audience in my intro
Please do not swear. You have sworn 33 time(s). Bad moderator/administrator!
oops
Great, the one thing I hate in the world, and they had to use it. <<
I'll be paying for this one more moneh comes in
11,01You can use credit cards through paypal.
Don't worry
*once
Be happy
Nittany_Discord: From Sweden there's heavy trouble
Just like with Google Wallet
Google Wallet = not working in EU
11,01Heavy trouble?
somepony here has a specific favourite pony? myself i like them all
11,01Oh.
Who asked for this song to play?
Spy: Don't go there.
My favourite is the one there on the screen :P
allpony is best pony
hello everypony
Nittany_Discord: yay your not Sad_Discord anymore :)
Allo Lightning_Derpy
Little Phasey best Space astrophysist...
hey LightTrooper105
LightTrooper105* tab fail
Except his rocket blows up all the time
11,01You won't let me be sad.

Hello there, LightTrooper105. :)
:3c
/me salute to d4rb and Meanwhile and Ninjazz

Nittany_Discord: because we love you that much :)
/me salute to d3rb and Jim
okay so
11,01Thanks.
Vordox: had terrible problem with my credit cards, but Paypal makes them work regularly
Phase4: Is the DP on sleep?
Anyway Drake
hia LightTrooper105.
MadSurge: Regulary = Never for me. :P
04XD
My mum came back from interviews
hello thur trollhunter
Overall she seems pretty happy about it
this kind of chat doesnt seem to be made for people like me...i dont think i will ever fit in here
Vordox: awww :D
Spy: Why you think that?
Spy: I feel the same way :p
00,02Vordox, yeah
maybe, maybe not spy, give us a chance though
ok..
Phase4: Figured, need to fix that Data ini binary thingie
You've only been here for like an hour. Just give it a shot
Yeah
Anyway Draaaaaaaaake I have my in-class extension english essay tomorrow ._.
so screwed
04Same
This place is great for just chatting, having some talk about everything
04;~;
spies fit in everywhere...except where there is fire
While doing other things or enjoying the stream if it peaks your interest
Emma/Clueless is easier than Disgrace though
So you should be fine
lol
but 2500 words is overkill
the thing is we all have at least one common intrest, ponies
Wubwubwub ^-^
Sad Phase = Best pony XD
btw Meanwhile you ever heard of Mount and Musket?
hurr
Vordox: did you make that oc for phase?
And we all love our wub's :)
my grandpha was driver of a fire engine
But yeah Drake, the assignment/project that interview was for
is due on friday
needs to be 2000-ish words
d3rb: Just the sitting thing there when he blinks
not including bibliography and appendix
Irish_Pony: No. I have not.
The others was made by someone else
intro is 500, main body is 1000, conclusion is 500
I have my intro done
thats the best part :D
04o-o
04blargh
And I wrote my questionnaire + interview in about half an hour
If you check the Bronystate Website he's looking at, when he goes to fire his rocket, you see the Colours jumo
I just need to format the questionnaire
The colours become stark contrast
then print it
Guess that spriter didn't use the same technique I did ><
I started it today
See?
how did everything about Derpy Hooves actualy start?
Spy: Football Mothers
11,01Damn stream derps.
Or you mean how she was to become who she was?
i think /b/ trolls personaly
It started when someone spotted derpy in the background on the first episode.
derpy hooves wasjust the animaters fucking around
no, i mean "Derpy" does sound like something from a fad
Derpy is the fan name
lol
Derpy is from the word "Derp" meaning "Doh" or "duh"
Asplode.
Woops
:D
well they lived atleast
lulz
derp may or may not have been started by the creators of south park
Phase4 I worry that the fuel seems to be very attached to the Shuttlecraft
Which was created back in 1996 and became first known through a movie with Matt Stone
Forgot to add an actual spaceship
8fueltank
Can anypony link me something awesome to keep me distacted for a couple of hourse?
hours*
COLLAPSED, AND THEY LIVED :D
but...all the save derpy things then?
baseketball....why has that not been shown here?
Now travel forth int ime to the first episode, or was it second, where a 4Chan member saw the cross eye, and the rest is history
Meanwhile: Well...theres this game that takes place during the times of Neapolic Wars, and theres this regiment that chooses there commanders in a rather interesting way...
Vordox: spy means derpygate
XD
Haha
:D bahahaha]
XD
no the Cabin is built like a bombshelter
Woops again
Spy: Save derpy was due to Derpy being censored, due to how she was potrayed as a "mental disability" which is utter bullshit.
Irish_Pony: And that way is...?
THEY LIVE!
how
pretty tough guys there Phase4 ^^
again they live
/me is getting cunfused
LIKE A BOMB SHELTER!
00,02Invi, ikr
Spy: Ah, I'll make it short
Meanwhile: they choose who has the best moustache :)
Irish_Pony: I win.
spy http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Derpy
this should answer most questions
Meanwhile: How do you know I win? hhhhhhhmmmmmm?
Spy: Derpy first appearance, as a talkable Background character,. She was potrayed, according to the people who did not like how she was seen, as a Pony with mental disability, in other words a Retard.
This caused a few people to take offense(in a cartoon, wtf?), and complained
The Hasbro got quite a few people on their tail who wished to censor her.
Vordox Also it was an animation error, nothing to complain over
oh...i see
BroKnee: I'm talking about Derpygate

Spy: After that, they removed the episode for 1 whole month, which caused an uproar as Bronies was forming theories about "DERPY IS GOING TO BE REMOVED",, Hasbro never let out any information which cased the avalancche of worries tip over.
Hello classikcolt ^-^
i think if the voice actor had done her voice as a female originally it wouldnt have gone as bad as it did
Yeah and we portrayed her in that way but not being offensive.. i think?

(\ Phase4
Not saying they did things right, but it was understandable.
Invi knows the truth
Nittany_Discord: Well take it off I want to see some aliens burn in a firey death!

I think you need to fix your staging :p
ok...
11,01Phase4: isn't doing a good job.
Spy: Ah Spy, one thing you need to know, no links to videos or anything unrelated to the stream. :)
04At least I understand the question
04That's something
the more you know
00,02i cant make it not fall over
And if it's related, ask before you post it, otherwise, no links(Except maaaybe some images, if you wish for it)
It's not symmetrical
what do you mean "during the stream"
video stream
Phase4: If it's not symmetrical, the rockets fire at different angles and it'll fall over
00,02i know
Phas
00,02but real rockets :(
are you using the web client or a seperate irc client?
Phase4: Also, I think your shuttle might be a tad big :p
Spy: when ever a streamer is streaming like now
Spy: Are you on Bronystate.com or a Text software, like mIRC?
00,02SpringStingray, NO :<
bronystate.net *

Buy some apples!

Mutterguy: Or the thing that reduces the cost of fuel
but...needs to be 20 % cooler though
Spy: He'll get to that....probably.. XD
Phase4: yes of course but you did get it to mun
Under the sea theres lots of shuttle debris!
00,02Spectrum_Rush, true

For my next craft I'm straping a slightly less minimalist http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13953.0 to the base of my space plane
We made it to the moon, let's take Luna home! It only took us... 1000 years?
hit orbit launch lunar craft
At least we got there...:D
Even better than krusty krab pizza
Phase4: is this thing really working?
LoyalDash: So they have to send a rocket to the moon to keep feeding Luna for a thousand years LOL
omnipony, That's, that's impossibru!
00,02its working excelently
yay
00,02not as good as try but still

00,02Malavolent, :3
Phase4: then you do relize that your gonna have to change your OC Desk pony action right? due to this success?
Cool.
O_O
Needs more rockets though.
So you can go to other planets in this game?
00,02Irish_Pony, lolnope
the Mun and a small planet extremely far away
Now he needs to be dancing with luna
Phase4: so your gonna purposly fail at any moment?
It explodes more than it reaches the Mun
I feel sorry for the little dudes if they crapped in their suits
yay oribt achieved
this is trippy with headphones
stage launched
Invi, Now how to get to Mars....:D
Jim: I dont hear anything :S

LoyalDash taht is easy but i think the crew would either starve on the way there or get stuck on the mars because no fuel ^^
00,02Y U NO GIVE ME INTERCEPT
Omigosh, we're going to the Mun!
Phase4: what happened?
Invi, We must go deeper into space, but we have no supplies.D:

you guys make me want pizza
funny if you pushed the moon out of orbit
ol
We will miss it D:
phase, what is thrust blocks for?
You might want to consisder MechJeb just for all the math it does for you
thank god for time warp
ignore the actuall autopiolt parts
00,02oh awesome
This is so intense
00,02i have epic levels of remaining fuel
Phase4: how much? :D
think you could make it back after landing?
Damn you bufer!
2 1/2 tanks which is lots
00,02one and a half tanks on the 2nd stage
00,021 small tank on the lander
Dero
Derp*
Phase4: hope no astroids hit you of course
:D
how much smaller is the lander tank?
00,02shit
00,02warped too far

Well... yolo

Going down.

Jim
Jim: You will feel it in the end.
i made it to the Mun,didnt see it,crashed into it
Wait, a successful lunar approach? :O
Phase4 do you manage to hit the moon?
he's in its orbit right now

Alien NASA would still be proud at Phase4

I haven't used them for ages
I've probably forgotten
:}D
Mala
it's -D -R or something
Well
+and
omnipony: ./)
i've made a rocket with built in missle firing capabilities
I made my own SSL cert
hurrrrrrr
And it is -D
ofna01: Daaamn.
Bombs? You want them? They're yours my friend.
Bombard the moon.
/me uses shred on HML's SSL cert
Made a bash script to made it easier for me to change

But yeah, doing a crazy amount of forwarding
Eeysup.
NAME
shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and optionally delete it
All the internet here is unblocked xD
DESCRIPTION
Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder
for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.
Uhmmm how much fuel does that have
:}D
::<
But
UGHHH
I have like 5 copies of that cert
you guys made me want Pizza!!!

RustyMeat: Horrible but fun

somepony_else: Oh nothing. I was just making a joke.
TF2 anypony?
We are great at this
Horrible butt fun?
ofna01: ;o?
i need someone to test my Shortstop on
But the joke was rendered useless since no one noticed
/me is listening to Nier soundtrack, bawling loudly with headphones on at the corner of the room, tears gushing out and sniffing.
o_o
seems legit
anypony got sc2? or am i the only one
it appears to me that this might need 1 more fuel tank stack
:D
so
anyone?
um i g2g eat. brb
Also,,Phase, LAWL design..
Vordox, you have VERY GOOD tastes.
ofna01: i would come but i g2 =\
uhhhh needs more POWA

Ninjazz: For what?
Phase4: needs moar engines
Phase4: if this doesnt reach the moon i dont know what will :D
Nier soundtrack.
bye bye BrOnyxia
/sarcasm
Needs moar rockets
bye then
Nier was the reason I decide to say "FUCK YOU IGN AND GAMESPOT; you PIECE OF CRAP CAN'T REVIEW WHAT GAMES ARE" and I never looked at those two ever again.
omnipony: I with you on that
BUCKING AHOLES WHO CANNOT DO ANYTHING RIGHT ON REVIEWING
/me nods
/me is bawling and passionitly shouting.
00,02this is going to explode on the pad
lol IGN
00,03So many rocktes 0_0
/me hugs Vordox
Phase4: thats the plan
Phase4: well i cant wait
i agree they might as well get money under the table for saying that a game is good
Scoot-Scootaloo: Hi you :)
im playing this myself, i have no engines and i keep climbing though
00,03Sup!
it clearly needs more glitter
Scoot
TF2?
Ninjazz: I was looking at Nier in the store, and the person who was at the counter just smiled and say, "buy it" but I decided not to, after watching some reviews online, and it looked boring.
00,02OH LORD
00,02IT DIDNT BOOM
WA
yay
HOW
But...my eyes was always drawn at it, even if I had the expectations of a bad game, my hunch told me to buy it.
BESt
Phase4 that amount of bolt I demand you need to ad to make this atay to gether is astronomival
11,01I see a stack of rockets on stream.
Phase4: for us that was a sopiler ...
GAME OF 2010! NO, THE ERA OF PLAYSTATION
Scoot-Scootaloo: not much, just been in love since midnight :)
/me now needs to go find himself a copy and a working PS3
Why must the BEST games ALWAYS get bad reviews....
What game is this anyway?
end of game
woow
Phase4: keep putting rockets until it explodes
:D
LOL IT DIDNT DIE?
Ninjazz: PLAY IT! Best Game of the ...ERA of playstation
Corruption, Vordox.
11,01One of the rockets broke.
Were coming luna!
RustyMeat: Kerbal Space Program
00,03Oh? Who's the special somepony?
Ninjazz: Borrow it if you have to!
Ninjazz: get that shit fixed son
Will do.
BEHOLD THE SPACE FRIDGE!!!

I wonder if this can match the speed of rainbow dash
Scoot-Scootaloo: Bunny_Maid_Luna <3
KIA
sonic rainboom
haha
Vordox, I'm not even sure anyone else has it.
indeed
LOL
needs more thrusters :D
But play it I will.
WTF
XD
Mutterguy: damn you theres milk on my keyboard niw]\
booooooom
Hai everypony!

SUPER LAG! hahahahaha
Spectrum_Rush, I don't know anyone who will fix it for me.
hai |Discord|
00,03....That didn't look good..
What is even happending
LOOOL
Phases computer wants to murder him
SUCCESS! sorry Spectrum_Rush
XD
Ninjazz: It's the whole stuff again... The whole thing about it...
OMG!~!!!!!!!!
HOLY SHIT
/me hugs Jim
Mother of god
obviesly needs more POWA
And that's how equestira was made
XXDDDDDDDDDDDD
that thing needs SOLIDS FOR TAKEOFF!
NUCLEAR LAUNCH
its a Super Nova
O_O_O_OO__O_O_O_O
rocket-lag-no rocket
more rockets!
:D:D:D:D
MOOOORE
Wasn't good enough more rockets.
:D
/me 11,01dusts Scoot-Scootaloo
This rocket needs to be 20% cooler
/me is dusted~
Ninjazz: One of the best games ever made, made by people at the brink of bankrupt, where they put their entire soul in the game, and then...CAUSE OF BAD F*CKING REVIEWING, they lost the will of their Soul of their company, and went bankrupt,...It was like Final Fantasy 1... Without success DUE TO REVIEWERS...
Needs to be about 20% more rocket.
AAAAAAAARGH!
needs 20% more GLITTER
/me kicks self
insufficent... Green people
...
lol
What're you talking about Vordox?
We need more rockets if we want to get to luna
he has to hold the engines together
insufficient green splatters over the runway
Meanwhile: Nier
NEEDS MOAR DUCT TAPE
11,01What game is this Vordox?
A game for Playstation 3, that was the best game of the era on it's storytelling
Oh, that all?
instead of rocket fuel needs AppleJack Daniels
And it got under the radar due to heavy influence of IGN and Gamespot mostly.
lol
again im back and.... so many rocket o.o
:O
Cue rocket music
2fps
it didn't explode :o
:I
no problem
Meanwhile: If you see a Classic well built game, with diversity of being the best story written, IT EVEN COMPARES TO SHAKESPEAR, being ignored, would you not be angry?
00,02its lagging too much
will it fly or will it fall..
aww
bye
Ever since then, I decided to focus on my hunch feeling, and let me tell you, it hasn't failed yet.
11,01What game?
00,03Too much rockets?
bai Spy
Vordox: I think it's a bit of a leap to compare Nier to Shakespeare.
sadface
Meanwhile: It's not...
too lttle rockts
00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, NOT ENOUGH ROCKET
11,01Nvm.
Vordox reviewers are generally very bad since they can easily be bribed by huge AAA title publishers for reviews and more or less not keep a neutral review, They always ruin their credibility by showing its obvious the review isn't neutral like saying its flaws and it's up sides
only one solution....more rockets
rockets*
00,03:O
killerpony7733: I know that!
MORE ROCKETS
Meanwhile: Heck, SHAKESPEAR WOULD BE PROUD to read it.
Phase4 why not use Truster?
00,03How the...?
wa
11,01It's too heavy.
died in style
Your computer is dead
Meanwhile: He loved the whole one side of a story telling with putting in other views and differences within the same perspective
I think with more rockets we can pass luna xD
11,01The rockets are breaking under the weight.
WHICH NIER Does! And it does it fluently, and it feels within reason.
That sound xD
OMG
00,03You needed more rockets ._.
Hahaha
He needs a far more pwerful rocket engine
rocket->lag->no rocket
lololol
bang
Kabooooooooooooooooooom
11,01Dead!
Vordox: They need to be neutral, else you can't review something
im pretty sure their dead
RIP headphone users
best fireworks ever!
i prefer more truster
best explowsion ever
11,01Fixed the lag.
Scoot-Scootaloo: tell me, how embarrassing would it be for my OC to be in a bunny outfit?
killerpony7733: Sad truth... As I said, never trust reviewers again
00,02it cant lift itself XD
Phase4 time to spam those truster
Phase
00,03It would be adorable, Irish_Pony :3
TF2 anyone?
Phase4: Build the Tanks and engines AROUND the shuttle? :P
ramp up those thrusters!
00,02one more attempt then tf2
SC2 anyone?
XD
11,01As embarrassing as you in a bunny outfit?
LOL
ahahhhaa
I find it hilariously unlikely that Nier is as interesting as you seem to think it is Vordox
Epic winn
rocket just fell over
LIFE OVER
Add more rockets.
Vordox: Yep they are very biased douchebahs that think they know soo much about games when they even take bribes for givign a game good score
Meanwhile: Play the game, is all I can say
Rockets all around!
Vordox: Don't own a PS3.
i like the pony in the corner trying the same thing, with the same results :)
Meanwhile: No, you know what, EMULATE the game if you can
Meanwhile: Tell me when you get to Act 3.
thanks omnipony for the rocket
Nittany_Discord: ya thanks for the support im just gonna have my OC put on a bunny oufit for my love =_=
lol yw
That's where the gold of the games comes into play
hi everyone... is Phase4 trying science again :(
11,01I'll let my OCs wear anything.
Yes lol

Majestic_Sparkler: Story, characters, Music.
Nier...I think ZP reviewed that.

my steam name is the same as my BS nam
Majestic_Sparkler: Downsides: According to everyone, is the graphics, BUT WHY DOES GRAPHIC DECIDE HOW GOOD A GAME IS!?
HiImSpike did something good happen?
11,01Thanks Spectrum_Rush
Nittany_Discord: even a maid outfit?
he blinded us with science
Grrr.
This will be perfect!
11,01Irish_Pony: Of course.
Lil_B: alot of explosions
ITS ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
i dunno. everyone said minecraft was shit but it wasnt
Nittany_Discord: :) np
The story is the biggest piece of TRAGEDY I've read, so much...
Fun fact: Anything is acceptable if you yell "FOR SCIENCE" afterwards
Minecraft is epic
owww nooooo
OH NO ITS TILTING
Majestic_Sparkler: Let me link you a sonk. :P
minecraft is kept afloat by mods
that doesnt look good
Mincraft is the single best game in a very long while
Vordox what game are you talking about?
Nittany_Discord: then im getting my friend to draw your OC in a maid outfit so that im not gonna be alone
Phase4: YOU FORGOT WINGS!
oki :D
Lil_B: Nier
It's swimming!

11,01Irish_Pony: Awesome.

Irish_Pony: actually i know someone who has done it actually
Vordox Nier is some of the msost awesome and unique sounding music i have ever heard in a long while!
JELLYFISH
wibbly wobbley timey wimey space shuttle
killerpony7733: orlly? who?
Lil_B: TRUST ME! The story is BETTER then the music
wooble is bad right

If the music is 100%, The story is atleast 125%
Irish_Pony: Iron_Edge i can link his DA
no, wobbly is good
11,01Iron_Edge has drawn my pony OC in a maid outfit. I can't wait to see what he does.
11,01Just no rule 34.
safe landing xD
Lil_B: If you get the change, PLAY the game!
Nittany_Discord: of course :)
chance*
Jim: oow was getting afraid for a sec
are you trying to land or take off? :D
Vordox: apparently it's not very interesting to play.
Vordox Only have a Wii... whats the gameplay like in this game?
jellyfish has returned to base
splash
look down back up your rockets now a hover craft
Meanwhile: Interesting to play. It has a unique, A HYBRID gameplay
O_O
SKILZ
phase is best pilot
... or atleast it was
DED
or not
Meanwhile: It is a Touhou, Zelda, Third Person fighting game with Bullet Hell and Melee dodges
killerpony7733: :D
do a barrel roll
why did the rest of the rocket disolve in water?
Irish_Pony: I daww at it
that was beautiful
Phase4: add me on seam so we can play TF2
Lil_B: The gameplay is unique.
It's been refered to as Touhou Zelda
11,01More people can do maid Cold Front.
it doesn't even HAVE a genre name for it's gameplay
Vordox yes,. I just read, maybe I'll look at a gameplay video later
Lil_B: A second, let me find one where there's a good view of it
00,02ofna01, steam name?
Vordox: it's described as gluey, schizophrenic, repetitive, unchallenging, and supposedly only above average in terms of story.
And really, if you DO play the game whole through, there's 2 MORE endings to it
Does somebody know "Press play on tape"?
Nittany_Discord: cold front?
Phase4: steam name is ofna01
Meanwhile: Where?
also hi everyone. again :)
11,01That's my pony OC's name.
to luna we wil go
ahh
Vordox: Zero Punctuation.
been here since 6 am, im just studying.
A sec Meanwhile , gonna check it. :P
Nittany_Discord can you give me a reference pic for your OC?
Hi guys!
Lil_B: i remember that phrase from my old c64 ^^
Hey MegaMoonShine
hi MegaMoonShine
hello
"ow didn't see this cominga action JRPG and Yahtzee actually kinda liked it.I really wanna check this game out it looks fun to me at least."
somepony_else yes, and there is a Band that plays old C64 Tunes colled "Press Play on Tape" I kinda like their music :)
Fetching results...
11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/803/h51gz.jpg/
11,01Oopa
11,01Oops
Meanwhile: Yahtzee ENJOYED the game. :P
It got PRAISE
11,01http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg803/scaled.php?server=803&filename=h51gz.jpg&res=landing
How often does that happen?
11,01Takes you to the same image.
Star rocket :D
<3
Well, this rocket design looks promising
Nittany_Discord: he looks cute. :P
Vordox: Very true. Considered competant in some areas and severely lacking everywhere else.
11,01A friend did that.
I see this rocket is gooing to lift off
Meanwhile: If I would review it, the 100% = Best part
Nittany_Discord thanks :D maybe I#ll get around to make a pic of your OC as well :)
11,01I chose the colors and designed the cutie mark.
11,01But he did the pic.
100% Story, 70% Graphics, 85% gameplay,
Vordox: Thankfully you won't review it.
Lil_B: you got a DA?
Meanwhile: Yeah true
11,01Lil_B: OK.
killerpony7733 yes
Lil_B: link? :)
wow... thats alot more rockets then for a minute ago...
Nittany_Discord: Thats exactly how I got my OC :D I told her the colors she drawed it :)
Really Vordox are you being paid to endorse Nier because the rest of the world seems content to give it a rating of "meh"
12!pokemon
Meanwhile: I played the game, ALL of it
Soital, you are a Larvitar.
Phase4: i thought we were going to play TF2
The full experience of the game is the best in the ERA of PS.
00,02ofna01, cant find you on steam
We shall name it David's Goliath!
???
really?
Meanwhile: I'll say this to you.
00,02this is lagging soo bad
God I miss Empire Earth 2 :(
so many struts
Phase4: what do you mean Phase?
11,01I also told him pony type.
11,01He wouldn't do draconequuses, so I had to pick a pony.
Vordox: I refuse to believe any games writing is on par with Shakespeare.
00,02ofna01, i searched for ofna01, no results
Especially a JRPG.
Meanwhile: "MLP is for kids, the cartoon graphics doesn't keep up to the quality of today, it's about parties and socializing."
:|
Meanwhile: Need I put in another thing then "Play it yourself"
oh and Scoot-Scootaloo you know tf2 right?
i really enjoyed the mass effect triology sure the ending in mass effect 3 was different but people just didnt understand it at first.
XD
Vordox: why.
damn
omg
Majestic_Sparkler: No do not mention it,
00,03I know TF2, I just don't play it 
Phase4: it wont let me add friends for some reason,how about you give me a TF2 server to join and ill add you from there?
that reminds me Phase4 you didnt accept my friend request on steam yet
:) haters gonna hate
ooooooooooow Phase4 all that work and still the same result...
wow, that seems like a new recort, crash in just 3 frames O.o
Meanwhile: Why I recommend the game, for the game experience in it's fullness.
does this beast have any wings or flaps?
00,03lol!
Phase4 it needs boosters. more boosters :D
Meanwhile: The story and music makes the game high above the bar compared to...well...any game
that noise. ..
Majestic_Sparkler: hardly the phrase you should use the ending was a massive middle finger to the fans
it's flying....
Phase4: apperently Im purple in your chat :<
ded?
00,02Irish_Pony, indeed
control system?
00,02Invi, hmmm
Phase4: I hate purple :|
meh i enjoyed it
and landing gears:D
00,02Mutterguy, whats that?
00,02Mutterguy, is it a new kind of rocket?
purple is cool
Vordox: Uhhuh, if it's all the same to you I'll be saving my money to try things that aren't described by the majority as "boring"
purple is best pony
no just the SAS
Meanwhile: Fun fact
11,01Too heavy.
Meanwhile: Fuck Majority
That's not a fact.
Phase4: i have an idea
It actuallly took off! Wooooo!
Majority sucks :)
Phase4: do you have Kammer on your friends list?
00,02ofna01, think so
11,01Nvm.
00,02a few rockets got left behind
Majestic_Sparkler: Because you're a completely special unique little soul.
Phase4: add me from his friends list
Is it working?
11,01Some of the engines broke off.
yay :D
Majestic_Sparkler: Sarcasm.jpg
i declare this a success!
I think soo
Majestic_Sparkler: You may have but i played all of the series and it just ends it in the worst way ever done no closure no sense of finally succeeding you just get the worst explanation of who the reapers are and why do what they do, But seriously i don't want to discuss a game that made me stop with the series
00,02i have a slight ammount of controll over this thing
Oh wow it didn't explode in 2 seconds?
00,02in theory i could make it to mun
Phase4 holy cow thats ALOT of rockets
WERE COMING AGAIN LUNA!!
The framerate improved aswell
11,01Add some RCS to help with control.
11,01RCS thrusters.
We've broken free from the lagg!
Phase4 is theorethicly possible, but practiply undoable
you just need to get it out of the atmosphere and you'll be fine
00,02i unno
is it starting to tilt?
00,02if i switch to the rockets with thrust vectoring
i've played all of them aswell and yes the ending wasnt what i had expected but i didnt dislike it.
some rockets are about to run out
that might be bad
Why is that thing even working lOL
The ending of ME3 made me hate it the more I thought about it.
ofna01 hes already had a set of tanks empty
Majestic_Sparkler: For the sake of a never ending arguement lets not talk about it please
00,02allso i have no staging or parachute
True!
It's tilting pretty bad!
00,02i was actualy relying on the rockets exploding off
Meanwhile: Majority
00,02i'm tilting it :P
Suddenly underwhelming in-the-dark macguffin ending.
Oh god.... its tilting
dont missclick and ejects any premature rocket pods
morning, everypony! :) *yawns* how are we all today?
Vordox: Mentioning the majority doesn't really impact anything.
man them engines are gonna pop soon
Specteum_Rush: Yes. yes it is :D
Meanwhile: Really? It forced Bioware themselves
morning sylandest
good thanks and how are you Sylandest
Hi Sylandest! It is afternoon for me! :)
dat spin
Phase4: show Mun so omnipony can see the one that made it to it
/me waves at Majestic_Sparkler, HiImSpike, MegaMoonShine :)
Vordox: It forced Bioware to make a shitty ending?
That noise is killing my ears!
lol I believe it already
oh hi Sylandest ;)
Vordox: EA more or less helped in the downfall TBH
and out of fuel
I see we're having more fun with rockets today, hehe. Is this a new attempt?
Howdy, Lil_B! :)
oh wow another set of tanks lol
00,02still have a few tanks left
Meanwhile: Shitty ending?
Hey develop your character and make all these choices but yo it doesn't matter anyway because magic space lasers.
Phase4: What have you created...?
I think you scared the living shit out of the passengers Phase :D
00,02Vordox, i have no clue D:
Meanwhile: Aaaand this is HOW farfetched witht the whole WORLD ENDING STUFF?
uh oh
MegaMoonShine: oh, he does that every time...they're pansies...:D
00,02omnipony, it'll get there in a minute
00,02theres a rocket called tri landed on mun
lol awesome
00,02and by rocket i meen the command module
00,02rocket exploded on impact
Luna!
oh wow thats awesome
Phase4: How much fuel do you have left?
I suggested we name it David's Goliath!
00,02Vordox, i think 2 tanks per rocket
Phase4: all becuse of that lieing altimeter
Hey Meanwhile! Pissed at Mass Effect? :D
00,02OH LOL
MadSurge: ???
00,02only the outside rockets work
MadSurge who isnt pissed at the me ending
00,02the inner ones have no fuel
Chrysalis: yup
Vordox: Are you somehow implying that pulling that kind of convoluted bollocks without any real explanation is passable because of the scenario?
/me coughs at Ninjazz and CrazyCherry :D
owwwwwww yeah crappy ending MadSurge
00,03Luna! We're COMING!!
Bless you, Sylandest.
Meanwhile: Yes?
Phase4 good luck movin with all that dead weight :P
Sylandest: Oh hiya Sylly!!!
Meanwhile: cough*starchild*cough
Vordox: Then your credibility is gone in it's entirety.
Ninjazz: no attack hugs this morning? :(
00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, all i could do is mabey impact with it, nothing i can do to land
Meanwhile: The whole scenario is based on fantasy, so why cannot you appreciate the idea of anything else that's fantasy?
CrazyCherry: howdy, cherry! :)
BRB
Chrysalis: never played that series, and I think too that that ending was bullshit. :D
00,02i love al the bits of space junk i've left around
We can deliver the pizza!! This time tossnit out the window before we crash
nick-check
00,03So that means you're going to.... bomb the moon? D:
Meanwhile: I'm not saying anything about WHY it's bad, it's still possible with the fantasy, it should be able to be used, AND being validated.
worked :)
Phase4 are you about to bomb the mum
mun*
Sylandest, sorry. Busy getting this damned iPod full of songs before I head off for a flight in... *looks at clock* 3 houra.
Back.
00,02Chrysalis, wrong orbit
No West, Kerbalia
Ninjazz: ahhhh, i see! Carry on then, hehe. No worries :)
00,02cant possibly transfer to mun
Ninjazz oh hi :) where are you going?
CrazyCherry: welcome back :)
00,02so bom kerbim it is
/me hugs Sylandest
Vordox: The magic star child who was never even hinted at appeared, caused our death, and left the end largely oblivious. There was no exposition, it just chopped our heads off and then gave us the credit screen.
Scoot-Scootaloo: the moon is infected with zombies we must destory it :(
/me hugs Ninjazz back :D
Lil_B|afk, to the states. and hello. :)
Nos coniungamus! Sit luna oriatur!
Whoa... Meanwhile also makes text walls too.
Ninjazz how long until we see you again?
Meanwhile: Isn't that a person dying the same thing?
i want to go to a brony meetuo :(
Meanwhile: and the god damn vague explanation of how he leads the reapers and everything is just grade A bad writing
Meanwhile: Also the star child is the same appearance as the child who died in mid game
Oh CrazyCherry hi :)
Vordox: It's bad because it's a macguffin, and it's bad because it renders all decisions up to that point meaningless, which in a game as into moral choice as Mass Effect is a real kick in the junk.
Lil_B|afk, hopefully I'll still be around as long as I have an internet connection. But I'll be back in a couple months.
Irish_Pony: I WAS HERE ALL THE TIME!!
Ninjazz: where are you going? :)
CrazyCherry: o_o
IF you hate the mass effect 3 ending ... Read this http://uninhibitedandunrepentant.tumblr.com/post/19344938387/mind-holy-fuck
Irish_Pony: aye, she has been here a wee while...XD
Meanwhile: I'm talking about the STORY
Meanwhile: Eeyup. After they promised that Mass Effect 3 would allow for a lot different choices, and that these choices would effect the ending.
00,02THIS THING IS IN ORBIT
Meanwhile: Not how it was executed.
Majestic_Sparkler: Is that the indoctrination theory.
Ninjazz well, i hope that you have lots of interntes there :)
MadSurge, to the states. All over most of the west half and the middle of it.
yes
haha we did it
Vordox: The story ends on a cliffhanger. That's a kick in the balls as well.
Meanwhile: I ADMIT ti's a sucky ending, but it's a VALID ending, it COULD happen within the fantasy of ME3
Lil_B|afk, If I can help it, I will. ^-^
Woot! you now have a Fueltank in space
Ninjazz: oooh, have fun!
Meanwhile: If you would die, would you live to see what happens after?
Meanwhile: You're playing a persona of Shepherd.
I'll try. ^-^;
ima miss you Ninjazz :'(
Vordox: I want to see what happens after.
I wanna make a shepard pony
/me hugs Spectrum_Rush "I'll try to be around. Don't worry."
Vordox: I want to know what happened to the people, the places, that's a really fuckign shitty excuse.
Majestic_Sparkler: Obviously biased, and someone who can't simply try to atleast see whats wrong
Meanwhile: Well Sheperd is gone.
i am pony shepherd,and this is my favorite cider on the citadel
/me snifff
:)
/me hugs Ninjazz
Phase4, Roughly, how empty is it?
Vordox: You're trolling me aren't you.
00,02i have enough to fall to kerbin, thats about it
Kammerjunk: tooo all that has not played the game spoilers... I found tha the ending nearly started a massive fight due the crappy 3 color ending
Meanwhile: No I'm not.
anyone got SC2?
Vordox: yeah you are.
noone ...
Phase4: lets play TF2
No one could look at that argument and think "yup, seems legit."
Majestic_Sparkler: I doo :)
ofna01: I'm commander pony shephard and this is my favorite stream on bronystate
YAY!
Meanwhile: No, Story Wise, it SHOULD end when you die, if you're palaying a certain person
Vordox: That's fucking stupid.
HiImSpike: It would have been less terrible in my opinion if they didn't previously promise a bigger impact of your choices.
Meanwhile: And you've been playing the same char for over 3 games.
00,02make it fall to kerbin and explode or leave them in orbit forever?
Vordox: You still see that guy telling about "the Shepard".
fall to kerbin!
Hello everypony
Phase4: Make it fall
00,02fall to kerbin it is
Kammerjunk: That's just load of bull :P I agree
Hey CrazyCherry, didn't notice you :)
either fate means a horrible death
Vordox: Yeah, I have, and I've gotten to know the universe over 3 games. I've met people over 3 games, I've decided the fate of species over 3 games. I want to know what happens to them.
Hello Princess_Molestia
Allo Princess_Molestia.
Molestia ... why did i even read that.
Meanwhile: If they show things after your dath, it's bonusthings
Meanwhile: And that's where some issues comes up
Kammerjunk: was the bit when the ghostly kids showed up
Vordox: You who compares Nier to Shakespeare have no right to talk about how stories work.
HiImSpike: What about it?
Meanwhile: It's been so upheaved within gaming, people feel that they got too used seein Resolutions from loose ends in game.
Meanwhile: If Nier head person adies, it's over.
Kamme
Meanwhile: And I mean OVER
do you have Phase on your friends list Kammer?
on steam
Meanwhile: Look at the old books of Shakespear, how do they end, how do they interpret it with words.
Vordox: Well, that sounds impeccably dull.
Meanwhile: Yet, they did it in such a way, that it felt like a resolution
ofna01: I do not.
I wanna play sc2 in pony style :(
Not a macguffin as you say
Meanwhile: when did you end Mass Effect 3?
:(
Kammerjunk: He was never mentioned and the choices had everyone uproared at my school
Vordox: that's different, that's reading, this is interactive character developement. This isn't reading the story of Commander Shepard, this is being Command Shepard.
/me hugs CrazyCherry
HiImSpike: ...Choices?
Meanwhile: It's what you do at the end before you die that's important, not the things after your death. Look at other games like "Lone person dies but noone ever knows" game stories.
00,02lol
00,02i slowed it to zero
00,02its orbit is down
Kammerjunk: True.
Oh my god!
Meanwhile: It's different, but it's story telling, You still have to follow the rules of the game, storywise, I THINK the laser ARE fine, sure it SUCKED but it was a choice.
I mean, I started playing ME like a week before ME3 was released, so I wasn't as hyped as everyone else, nor as disappointed.
time to play free fallin by tom petty xD
Vordox: This is a story, a story that doesn't have a proper ending. I want my ending.
Meanwhile: Trust me, I HATE ME3 ending too
Meanwhile: The end was that you sacrificed yourself to end the reapers assault.
Meanwhile: And you saw what happened to your crew.
Vordox remember what bioware promised?
Meanwhile: true
ofna01: ... are you a red vs blue fan?
Yay now my friend who thinks im insane for worshipping ponies online. Time to screw with her head.
killerpony7733: Yes, ending that was different depending on how you played the game
and now, charge towards the planet XD
Vordox: You didn't see shit about what happened to the crew. They crashed /somewhere/ and that was it.
Meanwhile: Yes, but you ask for MORE?!
I want details, I don't care if it's a fucking text epilogue, I want to know what happened.
Majestic_Sparkler: Good luck with that
ty
Vordox: You're really satisfied with the mediocre aren't you.
Phase4: free fallin would be a great song for this lol
lol
Meanwhile: I'm satified of games if they are good, overal good, yes.
Meanwhile: As I said, I hate the ME3 ending too.
Vordox yeah that everyone has a different ending they get for all choices made but yep ME3 that gave you 3 endings blue red green so you picked your poison and thats it no unique ending you got a ending everyone else got with hardly any difference
Meanwhile: Yup, they just crashed somewhere. Even the ones who were with you on the last mission.
Vordox: I enjoyed playing the game, which is why the ending is such a dickslap.
Meanwhile: Cluffhangers, storywise(Macguffin), the way they ended with the crew and all, and it SURE as hell doesn't feel like the end, but that was the end you got.
Vordox: Oh. I got it, so I should be content with it. Is that what you're saying?
Personally, I blame EA more than I blame Ubisoft.
So ais the atmosphere gonig to slow it down fast enough?
00,02Mutterguy, nope
Mutterguy: Not a chance :D
Meanwhile: Yeah me tooo
Meanwhile: 50 hours of gaming versus 10 minutes of ending
awesome
00,02no way to save these guys
DIVE BOOOOOOOMB!
Meanwhile he means you can enjoy most of whats on the plate but hate the last of it
impending doom inc
00,02wow
this gonna be good
00,03NOOOOO :'(
They seem oretty calm about their death
00,02actualy considering how much it slowed i could have
/me braces self
00,02with dificulty
no what I mean, will it be too fast to take the terminal velocity into account
00,02but anyway
Meanwhile: meaning you praise the game for being good but the ending is not a satisfiying one
if they surive this ...
boom!
Scoot-Scootaloo: They will be remembered :)
so it seems it does
ded
woops forgot the parachutes
00,02ofna01, i'll join a game then send you th eip
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnddddddd
Vordox: An ending is the defining moment of a series, one of the prime bits you look back on when you're feeling nostalgic. ME3's ending only works if you get nostalgic over being kicked in the crotch.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!
Vordox: More like 150 hours of gaming versus 10 minutes of ending without conclusion.
k Phase
CMON BABY LET ME SEE THE BOOM!
Meanwhile: Defining moments?
JIHAD
Meanwhile: Are you kidding me?
compact
ALAH HU AKBAHR
coooblamo
Meanwhile: I'd rather have SEVERAL defining moments of a game from start to finish, instead of one great moment at the end
ofna01: i found your steam
omnipony: hahaha:D
Phase said he cant find mine
Meanwhile: CHeck all classic games that get praised for it, HOW many had MINDBLOWING endings, or the ones that had MIND BLOWING moments over the course of a game?
Vordox: it had that but the ending wasn't the full epic conclusion of everything you have accomplished
brb everypony
anypony wanna play SC2?
ofna01: hey chicka bum bum
killerpony7733: Expectations does that. ><
Vordox: Are you really so ridiculous that you think putting all the effort into getting to the ending only to have it suck is worth it because of the effort part?
killerpony7733: didnt they say their will be an update
G'day, everybrony.
howdy, CountDoofus!
Allo CountDoofus
hey CountDoofus
This entire argument is moot.
Meanwhile: I never said it had to suck.
Vordox: But in this case it does.
Kammerjunk: indeed
Hey all you beatifull people
HiImSpike: only a extension of the ending still the same ending just with some extra post credit stuff about how some of your choices you made works out
Meanwhile: I, however, say that the end of a game DOESN'T have to be above good.
Hai, dr-whooves
Meanwhile: I do not deny it, ME3 ENDING FAILS big time
Meanwhile: But the path to it was indeed great.
00,02is the stream working?
Vordox: Ofc it doesn't have to be above good, it just has to not suck and ME3's fails at that.
Hey dr-whooves
Yes
yus Phase
killerpony7733: good to know thanks
00,02huh
00,02game seems smother
Phase4 *
hey dr-whooves
Phase4: Yeah its working
HiImSpike: hardly you get same ending only explanation
Have anyone ever tried invading a toy store with 50 people with you. All rushing for the pink section.
Majestic_Sparkler: cant say I have seen that, no :D
Majestic_Sparkler: all the time
Meanwhile: There's mANY things wrong with ME3
who is yelling? :O
Majestic_Sparkler: Yes. The expression of the employees is priceless.
Meanwhile: But it still gets praised...which I find odd in itself.
xD
Best times ever
TF@ YEEEESSS
better than getting maried
Vordox: what else is wrong with it, exactly?
Discord
ofna01: Yes?
want to play with me and Phase?
SURE
Meanwhile: Those are personal issues, not game wise
God damn Phase4: how big is this download
00,02big
Vordox: Somehow implying that every issue so far hasn't been a personal one.
Last night was amazing. I was one the omegle video chat with ma scray mask scaring the shit outta people.
Brb, I have to go move something.
Discord
ow k im gonna go cya everybrony
xD thats one epic server
i always say im a girl and post a link to rickroll
ofna01: Yes
lolol
lol
phase4 -quote rarity's whining rant...
Phase4: where did you find this map
Meanwhile: True, but do you not agree having a great storylike with high peaks, instead of an resolution at the end?
00,02lol
Soital the larvitar
An resolution that ends with a high note.
00,02Spectrum_Rush, its on the server
THIS IS WHINGHING JJKMDKVM
Phase4: k whered you find the server
i can give you the IP Spec
00,02Spectrum_Rush, randomly
12rar
nvm i cant

OMG ITS PONYMAS!
the weirdest things wake me up
:D
Who is that troll/whiner?
DED
Its like an endless migrane...
Phase4: ill be a spy when i join
00,02k
im always a spy
Meanwhile: And besides you were the one that started with "The majoritY" :P
its about half way done downloading now
/me crosses fingers hoping the map wont change
Lil_B|afk:

o-o
Twi is always crazy about her books xD
doubled
And luna is alive!
Back.
Vordox: where were we?
how can you shoot at twillight sparkle WHAt is wrong with you!
Meanwhile: I forgot, something about personal and majority being both wrong and both right
Meanwhile: I still recommend Nier, just for the story :P
Trying to join TF2 too... downloading :p
What happened to love and tolerance
Vordox: Not enough reason to play a game.
same Count
omnipony: That's a silly saying.
im almost done downloading
LOL
lol yes it is but its brony code
Meanwhile: Okay, fine, the Story, sidequest, design of the game, Gameplay differences, music
omnipony: Only if you're real daft.
ehh i know people that way
Vordox: You mean all the stuff that's made everyone else consider it to be slightly above margin?
moar heavys
Meanwhile: There's one downside, if you JUST focus on sidequest, it gets boring, if you focus on the main story, you'll be glued to the couch
Meanwhile: Like every other RPG game
Phase4: it better not be full
10o.o
Vordox: Implying /every/ other RPG is worth playing for story.
Phase4: after all the time i spent downloading
hi sky (nickbtw)
Meanwhile: Tales of(Any), FF(any), Fire Emblem(any), Star Ocean(All except 4), Zelda(Any)
god damn
im lagging like a bitch
Vordox: FF in that list? For story? You're kidding right.
omg, it's nick
Meanwhile: FF3, FF5, FF6, FF7, FF9, FF12
Mind you, FF isn't worth playing anyway. Loony JRPG emo kids with daft hair abound.
00,02he's doing what i do
he's been batman all along
hey i think i know that lunacy engineer
:D
how the heck did bruce wayne get suspected of being batman anyway
IKR? silly poncy millionaire douche
/me runs
Phase4: can we go to a different server?
so Nick or should i say batman :P
Phase4: im laging like hell on that one
who do you think would win in a fight
00,02ofna01, not many other servers that are worth it for me
you or ironman?
Meanwhile: Saying story is bad in a FF would get you laughed at. :P
Plz?
chuck norris
Phase4: Would play, but can't.
that's always the answer
00,02ofna01, well unless your in aus theres gona be lag for both of use no matter what
Vordox: The story is bad
chuck norris doesn't exist in the marvel or DC universe
sorry
i mean,im getting maybe 5 fps Phase
its bad
Vordox: story in FF is bad. As is gameplay, aesthetics, and just about everything else.
but he has to
no
he simply walked into mordor you know?
he's too broken
god Im bored :|
Though I do like Crystal Chronicles...it's fun to play
/me runs
o-o
Meanwhile: So you played which of the games to 100%?
/me gives Nick a dvd copy of the avengers
test
Vordox: You're talking to Meanwhile, your arguement is invalid
Vordox: If you try and tell me my opinion is invalid because I decided that I didn't want to continue playing a boring game you literally belong in hell.
WindWhistler: Not sure if positive or negative.
Meanwhile: positive
Phase4: ill give you an IP,come play for about 10 minutes,then you can go back to that server
/me hugs WindWhistler.
:D *takes and watches
Meanwhile: So atleast you tried it good.
(never did see it :( )
better not let anyone hear that
Tried, did not enjoy, got rid off.
(no one I knew was interested in seeing it and when it came out I was like in the thick of finishing uni work :\)
hi everypony
howdy, omnipony
Meanwhile: Then story in games are not you rforte. :P Simply
excuses
Vordox: Says you who compares Nier to Shakespeare.
Vordox: What you should be saying is that they don't interest him at all.
did /you/ see it at the movies?
WindWhistler: Forte, Focus, Enjoyment, etc etc.
yes
oh
I have no idea what's going on on that server.
Meanwhile: I still do compare Nier to one of the better GAme stories with Tragedy and Black Comedy, yes
is there a video game here insead if my little pony
.-.
Meanwhile and Vordox to avoid making this a discussion board can you take it to a PM?
killerpony7733: you're saying that now?
Hiya everypony
Meanwhile: Yes cause i weren't tired of seeing it about 5 minutes ago
killerpony7733: We found our resolution
aren't soccer moms SO stupid?
killerpony7733: We cannot agree since we like games for different reasons
Vordox very well then
nickelodeonmakesever: Who the heck are you?
For example, Vordox likes games that're mediocre in their entirety.
I am nickelodeonmakeseverythingbad
Looks more like you're nickelodeonmakesever.
And Meanwhile is one of those people who are under 21and say they enjoy games.
nickelodeonmakesever: So you don't like Avatar?
Vordox: True, I'm 19.
Meanwhile: I know, it's obvious
Vordox: What's that supposed to mean? I'm under 21 and I enjoy games.
i NEVER SAID i DIDN'T
:|
Oh, it's obvious. So Vordox is a snob as well.
Lovelu.
lovely*
WindWhistler: The era of game generations made a big leap in those 6 years.
Everyone's so busy arguing they don't say hi back to me :'(
howdy, Shimmer!
Shimmer: Hiya!
Suddenly everything is explained.
Vordox: Which means...?
Meanwhile: Nah, don't care for my outer appearance, rather be true to myself and see things for what they are.
Vordox: So yeah, you're a snob.
WindWhistler: The reason games are good.
/me hugs Sylandest and killerpony7733
:)
Meanwhile: A snob doesn't mean that...
A very pretenious one at that.
Games are good because there's a 6-year difference?
You hold yourself above others because of the way you interpret your world view. You're a pretentious snob who's trying too hard.
don't cry D:
WindWhistler: No, the core of it changed heavily, from what made games good, to what made games of what they are today.
Meanwhile: Well yeah, the WORLD is mine, as with everyone else...?
I fail to see your point?
The point being that you're a douchebag.
Meanwhile: Now you're just trying to insult me. :P
No trying about it, I'm literally insulting you.
Meanwhile: Vordox please take that discussion to a PM :S
Can you argue in PMs please?
Vordox: He got you there.
Shimmer: what i asid
Vordox: Meanwhile stop this petty arguement or take it to pms
Meanwhile: Meh don't care. You think what you know, and I what I know.
I think what I know*
Something tells me they aren't gonna take this to a PM.
Either that or Meanwhile is gonna stop and Vordox is gonna keep going.
I stopped starting
I'm just retorting
I started stopping.
You're both acting like kids :)
Hehe. :P
Wait
No
I missed the argument
What was it about
Differing opinions about games
Shimmer: You never grow up you just learn how to act in public.
Meanwhile: Troo dat
Meanwhile: pretend your in public then
Meanwhile: Well said.
Spectrum_Rush: you're*
This is a public chatroom, you saying you never learned it?
Shimmer: You startin'?
You guys DO realize you're just starting another argument, right?
Shimmer: If you do as everyone does, what do you ever learn, Shimmer ?
pootis
So you're about to become hypocrites
Meanwhile: grammar nazi:D
Grammar Nazi
08,01my god, i love cupcakes
Savior of the day^
I prefer muffins. :P
Shimmer: Interesting, You found an scapegoat. XD
I can agree with one thing though.
Meanwhile's good, he knows his stance, I respect that.
Want to see more of those around really. ._.
Spectrum_Rush: http://ponysquare.com/file/pic/quiz/2012/06/4050f674e201eb1c218f6851b8087631.png
You know that Wind Whistler is best pony
Meanwhile: im saving that
Vordox: I just ignored your bait and stopped talking ;)
*I'm
*BOOM* HEADSHOT
Spectrum_Rush: So next time I don't have to link it to you?
Then you stopped before starting Shimmer :P
Meanwhile: maybe, other uses

You know what I really hate? The English.
You know what I hate? Me.
Scoot-Scootaloo: I know, right? With their pecking and clucking and inability to fly. The nerve!
I hate you as well.
I would say I hate David Tennant to piss dari off, but I don't feel like being banned.

Wait, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Scoot-Scootaloo: what language is number 11?
WindWhistler: hehe, yes. Fortunately, it was only a little bit. And I'd say good, since you made me laugh XD
/me made someone laugh! Self-esteem went up by 42!
/me claps for WindWhistler :)
/me gets cocky and starts making lame jokes and soon everyone gets tired of her and then she learns a lesson about friendship
I hate the number 42. 43 is WAAAAAAY better
WindWhistler: that made me laugh.

Sylandest: It already happened with Mare Do-well.
WindWhistler is best pony
String_Shredder: You got that right! :D
WindWhistler: yes, but in terms of being cocky about one's actions and their selves. Not about being humorous, hehe.
08,01WindWhistler: i'd make a joke about not hitting on you now knowing this, but honestly for me if it has a pulse, it's fair game
Yeah but who'd that episode be about.
08,01correction: sapient and with a pulse
Meanwhile: I bet it'd be about one of the CMC.
WindWhistler: That works actually. Cutie Mark Crusader Comedians yaaaaay

I'm playing Spore.
WindWhistler: Oh. It stands for Sins of a Solar Empire.
Brb.
Spore is fun. Would be more fun with a multiplayer mode in the space age.
00,02TO SPACE
Somehow I am amused Phase4's creation.
wait is it effectively flaping it's wings?
00,02not my creation
I see the middle pilot has found the "special" oxygen tank :D he does not give a buck at all
00,02downloaded it
would be more fun if always mutiplayer mode Kammerjunk
Invi: Trudat
FASTER FASER
Kammerjunk: I dunno...they'd probably attack your colonies so often you couldn't get anything done. That would be annoying.
howdy, Invi!
hi Sylandest
Then again, they could help take out the Grox so I don't keep having to go back to protect my colonies...
So does this thing have, like...fuel? How is it flying?
Petrified_Discord: A wizard did it.
WindWhistler: Meh. Between eco system collapse and Grox, I'd have enough trouble anyway.
Petrified_Discord wing flapping
00,02needs ~300M/s before it sustains
Invi: :D In space? Seems legit :)
Kammerjunk: You should get green for Tribal and Civilization stages. One of them lowers the rate of eco disasters.
00,02cant actualy get this into sapce
Petrified_Discord: Hey, don't question the Kerbin... Kerbal... Whatever.
Petrified_Discord this isn't space silly. look at the atmosphere meter ^^
00,02it needs an atmosphere
Lol I was gonna say...you need air to keep flying.
Well some space...plane...this is *huff*
and there's no air in space.
in space no one can hear you die.
Phase4 I can see where the space center is....
total air control :D
GOSH DARN IT I KEEP GETTING DISTRACTED FROM SPORE

Hey, Kammerjunk, do you know any tricks to finding more terraforming tools?
It's hard to tell when a planet has an artifact or a terraforming tool...
or when it's pirates.
WindWhistler: I just know about 'chieves and artifacts.
Oh.
Space ghost pirates!!
Ah, well, I'll just look it up. And get distracted even more.
WindWhistler: Before you know it, you'll get nothing done in Spore today.
Kammerjunk: That's usually how it is when I look up stuff for games.

That's usually how it goes when I see a Cracked article.

THIS IS NOT PISS IT'S SALTY WATER
asparagus
back
nvm, dropped my food -_-
How far can we take the piss jokes? :D
MaidSurge: you have no idea...
MaidSurge: as far as possible
MaidSurge: Guess we're...taking the piss.
obviously this guy will never be a successful surfer if he cant get out of a riptide
if you ask me the camera man is more badass the grylls
Meanwhile: YYYYEEEEAAAAAHHHHHH :D
Spectrum_Rush: No fucking way
/me gives Meanwhile a trixie plushie
/me hasn't got a chance
/me sets the plushie alight.
i mean hes got the camera
The camera man has proper food and safety equipment
Spectrum_Rush: ...I just realized, you're prolly right. and morning, Om! :)
A lot of the time Bear has to use a handheld camera
Sylandest: How are you?
Because the camera man isn't allowed to come with him
Hello everypony......what are we watching?
Too dangerous
Om: I'm good, currently nomming on breakfast, hehe. How about yourself? :)
we are watching a tutorial on piss drinking x)
Hi everypony!
howdy, OtakuTom!
hi OtakuTom
Sylandest: Thinking about breakfast.
The camerman has a wet suit, boat, air tank
Hey, OtakuTom. :)
Om: smart choice, lol. perhaps you should ask bear grylls for advice? :D
Om better drink your own piss :O
Dark92Enigma: bear grylls
I'm sad that Bear Grylls is no longer employed by Discovery :(
back. The bread is toasting as I speak >:D
Sylandest: No... I don't think he is used to the copious amounts of food I have
OtakuTom: contract disagreement, wasn't it? something along those lines?
killerpony7733: I have lemonaid
Om: hehe, good point
Thanks Slyandest........what is it about?
Sylandest: Pretty much. They claim he wasn't fufilling his contract obligations.
Dat mucus.
MUCUS, OH BOY
Dark92Enigma: basically, we're seeing how to survive out in the wilderness of the world...though it is somewhat questionable at times :D
the bread is done toasting, BRB. AGAIN. UGH
MaidSurge: I'll grab my stuff!
OtakuTom: what obligations? not enough piss? :D XD
lol
Meanwhile: there is no time, your piss is enough!
nom nom
Slyandest We only need Wilson from Home Improvement (WIIIIIIIIILSON! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW, WILSON!????)
ah he's eating a black sea penis....
It is written, only piss can defeat Ganon.
Hi
Meanwhile: now that you have said it. it must be cannon
Meanwhile: mah boi, this piss is what all true explorers strive for!
INB4 he eats something horrific
Bronysith: Littlekuriboh is best pony.
Meanwhile: YUP
Eat a maggot.
No new episodes of MLP? Better drink my own piss...
eat seashells ^^
Water off a leaf? Not too bad so far :D
just waiting for season three.... drinking piss to pass the time
Yes, with a full camera crew on his back... drinking piss is the only option
Oh dear
These look...Tasty...
Hermit crabs.
The camera crew is not allowed to help him in any way unless his life is actually in danger.
Delicious.
Salmonella on legs?
yuck
Yum
here we go
Dem guts.
these poor critters
wow he's teaching us what we learned in 4th grade!4
dude! cook it!
killerpony7733: I can never forget
pop goes the claw
Fluttershy doesn't approve
Crab meat.
Invi: Fluttershy is probably terrified watching this
Imagine P.E.T.A. vs Bear Grills O.o
omnipony lets ask her: :'( oh you are right
PETA would lose, they're all built like twigs.
BroKnee: he'd make them drink pee
Meanwhile Ikr?
Oh dear.
Sea cucumber
Invi: Fluttershy will kick the shit out of Bear Grylls once they meet
Oh no.
Spectrum_Rush xD
Black Sea Penis!!!!
BLACK SEA DICK
MaidSurge: Agreed. Weve seen what she does to regular bears :P
A giant sack of black sausage.
Tasty
om nom nom nom
OtakuTom: ikr :D
MaidSurge: /)
Must taste salty huh?
The worst thing to watch him eat is maggost though
maggots*
That has to be the biggest sea penis ever!
Really massive maggots
Pretty ruddy disgusting. *second bite*
And larvae
DISGUSTING is bear gryll's "delicious!"
Bronysith: (\
Unlike Reggie Fils-Aime, his body isn't ready :P
"black, salty, pretty bloody disgusting" *keeps eaating* what the actual fuck Bear?
String_Shredder: shock value my friend
Hi all
String_Shredder: it keeps the ratings hi
gh
Ohai GreeHetBronyInDuits|
I am not one of those people
ded
Hipoxia?
dat pseudo dramatic narrator voice xD
You die without any idea of your impending death. What?
or how ever you spell it
Meanwhile: no idea
>stingray
>been known to kill
^
Because you pass out unexpectedly, Meanwhile. You drown once you pass out.
killerpony7733: Hypoxia. But you got the spanish version right :)
Petrified_Discord: hah what is it exactly?
Meanwhile You don't know your about to die, your brain cuts off momentarily and you drown while unconcious :p
was this before or after irwins death
After for sure
lol the reminds me of nigahigas survival video
Mah loongs a'e now bersting
Ninjazz: hey you play magicka right?
dat poor sting ray
back- AND WTH IS THAT! OAO
The poor stingray :'(
:<
Fluttershy's reaction..:'( HOW DARE YOU:[
yay we killed an animal
IowaBrony: its revenge for irwin
killerpony7733: Basically when parts of your body don't have enough oxygen. It usually ends with you passing out and, if you're undewater, drowning
DrHobo: man vs wild
twilight_sprinkle, I just need to reinstall it. I own it.
Ninjazz: so you havent played it yet?
MaidSurge: I know, but what was that ANIMAL!?
Ohai Ash
Got the boulder badge yet?
twilight_sprinkle, just a bit. I'm just kinda... terrible. :D
DrHobo: a stingray
Petrified_Discord: interesting it's like a blackout but underwater?
Inb4 girth
^
MaidSurge: oh
Bronysith: Did you know fans of Irwin hunted sting-rays and cut of their tails as revenge after he died?
Shimmer: good
killerpony7733: Well you don't need to be undewater when it happens, but if you're swimming you're gonna drop under the surface
Ninjazz: i dont get the difference between characters, the desciptions are weird <.<
Bronysith: Yeah, I think most people were expecting something to happen eventually, but not what actually happened
Ninjazz: sherlock mage seems to be op, as he can find secrets others cant
Bronysith: he surely did! I mean, crocodiles never got to eat him and then a tiny stingray is his end?
twilight_sprinkle, some are WAY better than others. I can't remember which one is the best, but there are ones with better offsets than others.
fig. 12 tree
MaidSurge: it was pure chance it hit his heart with the tail and killed him
08,01Bronysith: wow, the correct use of irony. have +1 internets
Irony: The opposite of what one expects.
Ninjazz: eh i guess il just go with sherlock mage
08,01Meanwhile: "Crocodile Hunter"
08,01yes, it is.
08,01he hunts the crocodiles, and is meant to be in control of them
Fail
MaidSurge: They also say it would have been better if he hadn't pulled the stinger out
dat laugh
08,01if they eat him, that's not what is expected
Hey Ninjazz, have you read fanfic about Applejack becoming tiny again and being tortured by Applebloom recently? Because I accidently read something like that, someone named Ninjazz in the comments made a really hilarious remark about it :P
08,01i suppose it depends on how you look at it
Ninjazz: Cast a super spell!
twilight_sprinkle, that's a good one. It doesn't have much offsets.
Ninjazz: kk
08,01if you see it as "he pokes crocodiles, he's gonna get eaten", *then* it's not ironic, it's coincidental
Dat's one cool shelter
DrHobo, I am the very same. Yes. And don't read that fanfic every again. ^-^;
Oh Bear grylls~ Did he drink his piss yet?~
ever*
This is animal snuff! O_O
Nyria: No, but he did eat a sea cucumber.
Meanwhile: Egh. Lovely~
08,01in that manner, being killed by a stingray *was* ironic
Nyria: no, not yet, lol. and good morning! :)
Dat roofing
Sylandest: Morning~
:O
Nyria: how are you today?
I wish I could make such an awesome shelter.
His little shelter has better drainage the all of London
DO HO HO
08,01anyhoos, i'm eating carrot cupcakes
Ohai, Om. Didn't see you.
08,01so my life is awesome
Ninjazz: haha, I wonder what would drive someone to write that. I can understand people writing clop, it's just their liking but, that fanfic was the sort of thing to traumatize 30 year old men ;A;
lol
Sylandest: I'm wonderful ^-^
Sylandest: How about you?~
08,01DrHobo: which one?
/me 08,01throws cake at killerpony7733
wow
Nyria: I'm doing well, hehe. Its a relaxed morning so far, no complaints here :)
he should hurry up before the zombies and skeletons show up
DrHobo, ikr?! That thing is not meant for mortal eyes!
/me catches the cake and noms it
/me noms on flying cake
hi all
08,01DrHobo: what's it about?
:)
35°C in here and Im melting...again
so bioware is now owned by EA after it was owned by microsoft
Sylandest: Indeed~ It's a good day~
Allo Master-Derpy.
Ninjazz: I take it thats one AJ fic I should avoid? :$
/me has a hankering for fish
howdy, Master-Derpy
Stingray and hermit crab. Nice.
thatssssssss a nice campfire
Genuinely tasty for once
Shocking
Sylandest, dude... Don't. Even. Read. The. Title. You will hate it. It's your version of Cupcakes, really.
PETA would be pissed watching this xD
08,01hmm
I like ray, it's tasty.
omnipony: peta gets pissed at everything
08,01i should stream some Stingray at some point
Ninjazz: :O I shalt not touch the thing!
Sylandest, gewd.
08,01DrHobo: sounds hilarious
True they get pissed at people having pets
Gordon Ramsey says: It's raw!
...........
Turn THIS OFF!
08,01DrHobo: that makes it even more hilarious
DrHobo, why?
omnipony: PETA'S jimmys are eternally rustled
DrHobo: youre a monster!
Anyone reminded of the Dayz mod when he talked about the night?
Ninjazz: I...I...my brain broke. what just happened?
Damn palm frond.
/me hugs Sylandest
Sea urchin
As they always will be
DrHobo: or rather the guy who wrote iot i guess
He's not going to eat that is he?
/me is unrespondent, brain broken
Stuck a sea urchin with a stick.
O____o
Eat it!
twilight_sprinkle: oh lol
Eat it you loony bastard!
Eat the spikey ball of death!
DrHobo. T__T
Well if he drinks his own piss, He'll do anything
Ninjazz: wat did you do to Sylandest
Ninjazz: I'm sorry :(
Spectrum_Rush, ask DrHobo. T__T
DrHobo: wat did you do
DrHobo, it's... well actually it's more sad for Sylandest.
Protip, don't bathe in the amazon river.
/me is incapable of comprehending anything at this moment
And the viewer count just went up~
Meanwhile: piranas?
Lawl
Ninjazz: what happened to them?
Gettin naked O_O
Not just that
haha~
killerpony7733: I was thinking more of the fish whose nickname is "The nut breaker"
Tree-ups?
What about that fish that swims up the urethra?
And gets stuck there
With it's spines holding it in
Petrified_Discord: He gets nekkid every few episodes.
Petrified_Discord: Fluttershy-ups
Spectrum_Rush: ^
>breakfast
Ninjazz: I've rebooted now. I'm back. :) memory wiped clean :D
>sea urchin
something's wrong with my connection, it always buffers evertim
DO NOT WANT
Imagine eating that raw XD

Sylandest: I didn't and I'm not going to now~
Damnit.
Nyria: hehehe :$ can't say I blame you
the urchin squeals with pain
as its insides are eaten
You're going to die slow and lingeringly.
Has Bear Grylls ever cried on camera?
Why would he cry?
DrHobo: i would do all of this for much money
Lawl
Build a spaceship!
Bronysith: true, true

Why don't starving people eat their hair?
a giant rock
omnipony: and then accompany it with some fine piss
I don't know if he will survive, he looks a bit wet behind the ears
omnipony do you smell what the rock is cooking
Stupid ads
Thankfully he did all those tree pull ups to help him~
omnipony: its not a rock....its a boulder! *sniff*
SimGretina get adblock
Still THIS IS HIS DESTINY!?!?!

CCCP: if he gets in real danger they get him out
omnipony: how does one define survival in cutie mark form?
tall grass and stuff
twilight_sprinkle: i guess but hes stil not 100% safe
He has horrible luck, he's an incredibly good survivor but he gets a meme on him drinking piss~
CCCP: yeah
Sylandest: It would be a snake skin filled with piss :D

Well, now you know
/me tackles Ninjazz
:P
I've slept on a beach once. The sand is a very nice to sleep on :).
The best way to find a drink is to ask the cameraman
Oi! I got to get ready for a flight in 30 minutes!
Ninjazz: Did you pack yet?~
Ninjazz: Ohh! Fun stuff!
Ninjazz: were you going?
where you going to Ninjazz

That's a one big nut
Sucks to be one of those people
Ninjazz: where you going to?

i dont get that
A metric ton >_> woah
alexxm: No idea.
And most of the West Coast and Middle of the US.
Welsh_Pony: He'd come out with the head of a manticore in his hand saying "that was easy."
What a way to go, hit in the head by a coconut~
hi guys,what's up :)
He's twisting nuts
howdy, sergio_scriptor

02>Restart computer plz

SimGretina: o///o
02Hmm
02How about no
Nyria could be worse i heard someone died because a bird dropped a turtle on him
He cant even fit his hand around that nut
poor bear :(
hey sergio_scriptor hows your day been
alexxm: how is that possible?
alexxm: A thousand ways to die no?~
alexxm: that did happen, lol. t'was a true story
alexxm: That was a Greek philosopher or something
it's been good alexxm thanks for asking :)
Well, I guess he will be drininng a piss shake now
sexy
DrHobo: impact from a dense object falling from a tall height impacting the head? quite feasible, lol
How lovely~
lol vittiman he says
Om: diet piss?
Sylandest: I meant how did the bird pick up a f*cking turtle e3e
Sylandest: He did shave of something, not sure if it was callories and sugar tho...
as anyone made a piss meme joke yet ?
Nuts are saving lives
The bird in question being an eagle DrHobo
DrHobo: it was a large bird, lol.
So hardly a small bird.
Those motherfuckers pick up goats and throw them off clfifs
cliffs*
the shell i guess DrHobo and it was an eagle from what i heard
XD
alexxm: so I was told a few seconds ago dB
Om: not sure if i should pursue or just watch bear drink his piss...
Everlasting_Joy: :D
DrHobo: eagles often pick up turtles and drop them from great heights to crack their shells and eat them
Everlasting_Joy: African or European swallow?
Sylandest: You just wana see bear parts :D
MaidSurge: oh
The story goes that the eagle saw a shining rock
Om: I do not! XD
Sylandest: :D.
Which was actually the bald head of the philosopher
Sylandest: Suit yourself xD

I call absolute bullshit
Hey Wrek! :)
fish-hook made out of fishbone, the irony
^THIS
I would have been screaming a bit...
the correct term were thrilled
And the sharks would be drinking piss
If I were in imminent threat of being eaten by a big ass fish I'd be scared about it.
SimGretina, you make music?
yeah
Om, they secrete their piss.
got to me thinking... maybe one of us here is a famous brony musician in a disguise...
how often do you have the chance to get attacked by a shark?
^

Petrified_Discord: :) must be beautiful

Omnom raw turtle.
McGuyver is not impressed
So there I was, watching the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame, checking BronyState for what is playing on Friday.
Who would have guessed
MaidSurge: Pretty much :) There was this big-ass manta ray too, but it didn't want anything to do with us :P
Macguyver would've turned the shark into a helicopter
^
lol
Meanwhile: sharcopter?
Ah I see Bear grylls is going to be saved by Otakon~
Petrified_Discord: mantas are pretty much innocuous :)
STOP TALKING AND SIGNAL YOU FOOL
Nyria: haha! :D
he will have to pay for the time they wasted on him
Gaston: o_o
ikr
I was gonna vote for it too
where'd his shirt go?
Nyria: wait.. where is otakon
Nopony watches Bear Grylls like Gaston.
Panda: With Gondor I guess~
Nyria: i miss him :(
om: true story

Om you're here?
Panda: Om's been here awhile XD
hmm, surviving=heroism
Panda: Hmmm...Yes.
Panda: Well, he's going to be coming not in the afternoon but in the evenings from now on~
Needs more nuts

/me hugs Om
just saying
Panda: You didn't notice xD
RyunosukeKnT: how would he record then
Nyria: oh? so... you know the situation?
Ryunosuke he must use his two hands!
And then the helicopter flew in and took Bear Grylls away
And then they shot him with a cannon
Panda: Ja~
Om: nope, you are incognegro :)
"I've run out of food, so I'm going to have to start eating my cameramen."
Hey, I want a hug!
2/10 would not bang
/me hugs Gaston
Nyria: im glad....
it needs more nuts
ao many seasons
yep S2E8 zambia

No one gets hugs like Gaston!
twilight_sprinkle: if he was seriously in that situation, I dont think recording should be his top priority :)
/me gives Gaston a hug
Panda: Not sure if miss spelt, or making a joke e_e
DO IT DO IT :D
Panda: Glad?~ It's bad dear~
05ah the pus filled ones?
